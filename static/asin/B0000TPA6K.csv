The first episode where Liz Parker discovers that there really are Aliens in Roswell was one of the better episodes but I found myself liking many of the episodes at least for their creativity. Isn't first season the one in which one of the guardian aliens teaches his young protoge that he can get through the government ID scanner by changing his finger prints? ( the scanner was designed to detect a shapeshifter like the guardian by detecting their lack of a skeleton which humans and the young aliens all have).I thought at first that the end of season episodes introducing a fourth alien, ""Tess"", were in fact from second season (I first saw them on the SciFi channel) but learned otherwise. This is an example, these episodes took the show off on a new angle, of the increasing sloppiness that The WB and then UPN took with the series.

783388,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,B0000TPA6K,Brett D. Cullum,"[2, 2]","Why did I not watch this show until the DVD?  I was afraid it would be BUFFY meets DAWSONS CREEK -- BUFFY's CREEK or DAWSON THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  Teen shows were hot at the time, and it was hard to keep track!  ROSWELL came along quietly with its Sci Fi metaphor - the alienation you feel as a teenager expressed by three aliens...the space kind.  It was a totally new way to revel in the timeless drama of ROMEO AND JULIET - impossible first love.  Nowhere NEAR as violent or dark as BUFFY, and also more mystical than DAWSON's CREEK - ROSWELL stands on its own quite well in this DVD set covering the first season.The story is about alien teenagers who live as humans in Roswell, and the impact they have when their secret is outed when a random act of violence forces one of them to save the life of a girl he has loved from afar.  Secrets fester, and love rears its head as the whole town begins to suspect something is up ... especially when the FBI comes in under everyone's radar.  I gauge good Sci Fi by how much it explores what it means to be &quot;human&quot;, and this series does that EXTREMELY well.The DVDs are in widescreen, and have commentaries scattered throughout.  23 episodes, and a couple of featurettes -- one on the making of the series, and another about the BOOK SERIES this show was based on.

The characters - and that's what this show is all about - are quite unique, well acted, and very complex.  They're aliens, but that just gives them something to keep secret, something to fear.  A lot of the stories involve their relationships with us regular humans, namely their girlfriends.  The best thing about this show is that's it's original;  There's not a cliche to be found anywhere.  And that is unbelievable in the sci-fi genre.  It's also extremely funny, as some of the characters, namely Maria, are really sarcastic.It centers around the three teenage aliens:  Max, the responsible one, also rather dark and brooding.  Micheal, the irresponsible one, he can be annoying but you can see so much of yourself in him that he's impossible to dislike.  And Isabelle, the beautiful girl who just wants to live a normal life.  Then there's Maria, Micheal's girlfriend (she's human).  She's quite a firecracker, as the saying goes.  But at the same time very vulnerable and passionate.  And of course Liz, Max's girlfriend (another human).  The story begins as she accidentally gets shot in a botched robbery at the cafe she works at, and Max brings her back to life.  That develops into a long-running relationship with Max, and brings with it the first introduction of an outsider into the alien's secret.The show starts out being mostly about the relationships of the characters, perhaps a bit like 90210, if 90210 was ten times more mature, witty, original, believable, and just didn't generally stink.  However in Roswell, there always seem to be dark forces lurking in the background.  Who are they, and what will they do?  This forms a lot of the plot lines of later episodes.All in all, a wonderful series.  I'd definitely recommend it - you'll be very surprised.",5,A real surprise,1091664000,"08 5, 2004",2004,1952,"['saw', 'series', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'typical', 'alien', 'conspiracy', 'coverup', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah.Actually', 'show', 'superbly', 'done', 'characters', 'what', 'show', 'are', 'quite', 'unique', 'well', 'acted', 'very', 'complex', ""'re"", 'aliens', 'just', 'something', 'keep', 'secret', 'something', 'fear', 'lot', 'stories', 'involve', 'relationships', 'regular', 'humans', 'namely', 'girlfriends', 'best', 'thing', 'show', 'original', 'not', 'cliche', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'unbelievable', 'sci-fi', 'genre', 'also', 'extremely', 'funny', 'characters', 'namely', 'Maria', 'are', 'really', 'sarcastic.It', 'centers', 'three', 'teenage', 'aliens', 'Max', 'responsible', 'one', 'also', 'rather', 'dark', 'brooding', 'Micheal', 'irresponsible', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'annoying', 'can', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'impossible', 'dislike', 'Isabelle', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'Then', 'Maria', 'Micheal', 'girlfriend', 'human', 'quite', 'firecracker', 'saying', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'vulnerable', 'passionate', 'course', 'Liz', 'Max', 'girlfriend', 'human', 'story', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'botched', 'robbery', 'cafe', 'Max', 'back', 'life', 'long-running', 'relationship', 'Max', 'first', 'introduction', 'outsider', 'alien', 'secret.The', 'show', 'out', 'being', 'mostly', 'relationships', 'characters', 'perhaps', 'bit', '90210', '90210', 'was', 'ten', 'times', 'more', 'mature', 'witty', 'original', 'believable', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'generally', 'stink', 'However', 'Roswell', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'dark', 'forces', 'lurking', 'background', 'Who', 'are', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'lot', 'plot', 'lines', 'later', 'episodes.All', 'wonderful', 'series', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'surprised']",Roswell - The Complete First Season

783396,A3JM17QHAJCOWD,B0000TPA6K,Catherine Gallanti,"[3, 3]","Roswell is an excellent series. It is obviously a teen series, but adults can watch this one too, as the story is very intriguing. And some of the young actors are excellent, I particularly like Majandra Delfino, the actress that plays Maria...She is excellent and very funny. The series would slip into corniness without her.The plot in the first season is very good. Liz is injured at work by a shooter and Max heals her, hence revealing that he is an alien. It turns out that he, his friend and his sister Isabel are all three aliens, human alien genetically engeneered hybrids to be specific, which were born out of a pod dropped on Earth during the Roswell crash. The three are just as clueless as to why thay are on Earth and of who they are as the rest of us. So the story is an interesting twist on the coming of age, finding one's self adolescent theme that is typical of teen dramas. I have described this as the X-files meets the Hardy Boys meets Melrose place, as the story is chock with conspiracy theories, mysteries but also romance. Very fun stuff.

783398,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0000TPA6K,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 2]","Like many shows, I always end up hitting what I call the ""ass end"", meaning I don't get into the shows until long after they've premiered. CSI, Smallville, Lost; the shows were well into their second season before I even paid attention. With Roswell, the show was already over before I actually noticed. It was purely a blind buy: never saw a single episode and it was quite a successful blind buy.Liz Parker(Shiri Appleby, one of the cutest things that was on primetime) works at the Crashdown Cafe in Roswell, New Mexico so naturally the cafe has an alien theme. 2 men get in a skirmish one day and a gun goes off, nailing Liz in the stomach. An odd buy named Max(Jason Behr) goes up to her and miraculously heals her. So what is he? Well along with his sister Isabel(Katherine Heigl) and Michael(Brendan Fehr), they're aliens with gifts.Along with Liz's quirky friend Maria(Majandra Delfino) and Alex(Colin Hanks, yes the son of THAT Hanks), they deal with not only questions of where they're from or what they're capable of but also the people who are after them, namely the FBI, or as they were known in the 50's, the G-Men or Men in Black. By the way, they're so obvious FBI agents when you see them. So much for trying to remain inconspicous.Unlike shows like Smallville or Lost which focused on the story/mystery, Roswell was more like a teenage drama with supernatural elements. The love story of the characters often took a backseat to the story concerning the unearthly teens. At times though you might find it quite thick as characters might do things that just seem so obviously bad such as confessing their love than all of a sudden: ""we can't be together"". It's as if the writers just changed the character situations suddenly to fit the story.Speaking of which, in the beginning the powers weren't very defined. At least with Smallvile, we know Clark's powers and their limitations so the writers wrote their episodes with them. Here it's like ""crap, I can't get in this door? I know, I'll use my magical lock opening ability. Hm, my pencil's unsharpened. Ooh I'll use my hand to sharpen it."" Later on in the season, the characters pretty much had a main power so they got better.Since it's the WB you can expect an attractive cast and for the women, boy do we ever. Aside from the aforementioned Appleby, both Delfino and Heigl are quite a sight and the men are good too if you're into men. As for acting, they do their respective stuff well. Not enough to make them incredibly complex but giving enough so they're not one note.Most likely marketing and advertising but Roswell was cancelled after 3 seasons(the last only had 18 episodes when seasons are an average 22) but in a way it helps since shows can sometimes go on for too long and just repeat episodes(Law and Order or Friends anyone?). I watched the entire first season in one day and it was quite good, only the excessive making out bothered me(it was still hot though).",5,"Too bad the show was cancelled, it was quite good",1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,2949,"['many', 'shows', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'hitting', 'what', 'call', 'ass', 'end', 'meaning', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'shows', 'long', ""'ve"", 'premiered', 'CSI', 'Smallville', 'Lost', 'shows', 'were', 'well', 'second', 'season', 'even', 'paid', 'attention', 'Roswell', 'show', 'was', 'already', 'actually', 'noticed', 'was', 'purely', 'blind', 'buy', 'never', 'saw', 'single', 'episode', 'was', 'quite', 'successful', 'blind', 'buy.Liz', 'Parker', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'one', 'cutest', 'things', 'was', 'primetime', 'Crashdown', 'Cafe', 'Roswell', 'New', 'Mexico', 'so', 'naturally', 'cafe', 'alien', 'theme', '2', 'men', 'get', 'skirmish', 'one', 'day', 'gun', 'off', 'nailing', 'Liz', 'stomach', 'odd', 'buy', 'named', 'Max', 'Jason', 'Behr', 'miraculously', 'heals', 'So', 'what', 'Well', 'sister', 'Isabel', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Michael', 'Brendan', 'Fehr', ""'re"", 'aliens', 'gifts.Along', 'Liz', 'quirky', 'friend', 'Maria', 'Majandra', 'Delfino', 'Alex', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'son', 'THAT', 'Hanks', 'deal', 'not', 'only', 'questions', 'where', ""'re"", 'what', ""'re"", 'capable', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'namely', 'FBI', 'were', 'known', '50', 'G-Men', 'Men', 'Black', 'way', ""'re"", 'so', 'obvious', 'FBI', 'agents', 'when', 'see', 'So', 'much', 'trying', 'remain', 'inconspicous.Unlike', 'shows', 'Smallville', 'Lost', 'focused', 'story/mystery', 'Roswell', 'was', 'more', 'teenage', 'drama', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'love', 'story', 'characters', 'often', 'took', 'backseat', 'story', 'concerning', 'unearthly', 'teens', 'times', 'might', 'find', 'quite', 'thick', 'characters', 'might', 'do', 'things', 'just', 'seem', 'so', 'obviously', 'bad', 'such', 'confessing', 'love', 'sudden', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'together', 'writers', 'just', 'changed', 'character', 'situations', 'suddenly', 'fit', 'story.Speaking', 'beginning', 'powers', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'defined', 'least', 'Smallvile', 'know', 'Clark', 'powers', 'limitations', 'writers', 'wrote', 'episodes', 'Here', 'crap', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'door', 'know', ""'ll"", 'use', 'magical', 'lock', 'opening', 'ability', 'Hm', 'pencil', 'unsharpened', ""'ll"", 'use', 'hand', 'sharpen', 'Later', 'season', 'characters', 'pretty', 'much', 'had', 'main', 'power', 'got', 'better.Since', 'WB', 'can', 'expect', 'attractive', 'cast', 'women', 'boy', 'do', 'ever', 'Aside', 'aforementioned', 'Appleby', 'Delfino', 'Heigl', 'are', 'quite', 'sight', 'men', 'are', 'good', 'too', ""'re"", 'men', 'acting', 'do', 'respective', 'stuff', 'well', 'Not', 'enough', 'make', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'giving', 'enough', ""'re"", 'not', 'one', 'note.Most', 'likely', 'marketing', 'advertising', 'Roswell', 'was', 'cancelled', '3', 'seasons', 'last', 'only', 'had', '18', 'episodes', 'when', 'seasons', 'are', 'average', '22', 'way', 'shows', 'can', 'sometimes', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'just', 'repeat', 'episodes', 'Law', 'Order', 'Friends', 'anyone', 'watched', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'day', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'only', 'excessive', 'making', 'out', 'bothered', 'was', 'still', 'hot']",Roswell - The Complete First Season
783399,AE2KCASMQPMO,B0000TPA6K,"C. Meja ""CMM""","[6, 7]","I remember watching this series during this first season, but I had forgotten how addictive it grew in my schedule to watch it. It is a wonderfully crafted mixture of sci-fi and teen drama, softly flavored with edgy, intelligent dialogues. Liz Parker is a teenager who gets shot in the restaurant owned by her parents, and is then saved by another teenager, who lays hands on her. Max Evans is then forced to tell her his secret: he, his sister and his friend Michael, are, indeed, aliens. From that point the three aliens begin the path of connecting emotionally with humans (who they have avoid their whole life, and include Liz's friends: Maria and Alex) as they have to face the dangers around them. Sheriff Valenti is the most relentless menace for their secret throughout the season. It is most remarkable (as it is with other series like Buffy and The X-Files) the metaphoric level of the stories. My favorite episodes of the season are: Missing: Liz has written all her secrets (and Max's) in a journal, and it is now missing; the paranoic feeling of this episode is very well achieved and keeps one wondering who is onto them. 285 south: Michael ""abducts"" Maria so he can use her car to get to a place where he believes there are clues to know his true origin; he is followed by the very cautious Max along with Isabel and Liz... but two menaces are following their tracks. River Dog: after finding a symbol in a necklace, Max contacts an indian who knew the fourth alien they have been looking for. Heat Wave: this episode is hot from the very teaser... Maria and Michael kiss (and a bit more) while Liz sees them, this encourages her to make a move towards Max. Blind Date: after being dumped by Max, Liz finds new posibilities with the help of Maria, but her night gets complicated after Max gets drunk and begins his conquest efforts all over again... only a bit out of control this time. Independence Day: Michael feels agains the wall, as he gets hit by his foster father and realizes that this is one thing he has nothing in common with the other aliens... he turns then to Maria. Sexual Healing: this one is even hotter than heat Wave... Max and Liz kiss and she begins to have flashes of the crash in the 40s. So they try to take their contact as far as they can, in order to discover what happened back then. Crazy: Topolski (the FBI agent who spies on them during the first half of the season posing as a guidance couselor) returns after being tortured by an FBI agent who is onto Max... she tries to warn the kids, but they don't trust her. Max to the Max: Liz is taken by Nasedo (the shapeshifter alien known as Nasedo) in an effort of the alien to mislead agent Pierce and have then an opportunity to kill him... but by the end of the episode, it is the real Max who falls in the hands of the alien hunter. The White Room: Max is tortured by agent Pierce, while his friends try to find a way to rescue him. Destiny: As the whole group tries to escape from agent Pierce, they find the most unexpected ally: sheriff Valenti. By the end of the episode, great revelations destroy relationships. This is a really enjoyable show, particularly because of the great counterpoint that the viewer finds between the very well designed characters: the main couple's love finds a very interesting undercut in Michael and Maria's, as Max's cautiousness is completed dramatically by Michael's ruthless behaviour, and their passionate devotion to different endeavors finds an interesting counterpoint in Isabel's dettachment. The same goes for the human characters. Maria is perhaps the character with the best lines (""Topolsky is a plant"") and attitudes... she can deliver the funniest moments of an episode, as well as the most painfull (mainly because she represses her pain and finds a way to make it more interesting, through agression or humor). It is most remarkable the development of the Valenti character, as well as William Sadler performance.The other great thing about this package (the box is not as compelling as the ones from other Fox releases, such as Buffy, The Simpsons or The X-Files) are the extras. I thought it was going to have more, but I was satisfied by the ones to be found. The featurettes are interesting and enjoyable. But, the best extras are the Shiri Appleby and Majandra Delfino's commentaries: they are probably the funniest commentaries I've ever heard in any DVD. Jason Katims and David Nutter's commentaries are very insightfull about the process of creation, Thania St-John's explained very well the metaphors and the dramatical development of an episode (it made me like much more ""The Balance"": I went, oh! of course!). But Shiri and Majandra's let one know some of those details of the making which are worth to know (there were some tales that really made laugh so hard, I thought I was going to pull a Michael -wait to hear what he did in a lake and for a bet... it is just hilarious). I hope they do more commentaries for seasons 2 and 3, but it would be nice to hear them along with the other cast members.This show really explores the boundaries of the development of a subject, of an individuall... how human can one be, from whence come those impulses that lead us to mistakes, those that make us feel embarrased or that lift us up to a heaven as imposible to grasp as the universe itself.",5,Truely addictive,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,5347,"['remember', 'watching', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'addictive', 'grew', 'schedule', 'watch',

783400,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,B0000TPA6K,CodeMaster Talon,"[86, 95]","So I was over at a friend's house last night, telling her all about the brilliant and woefully underrated show ""Roswell"", when she suddenly says: ""Roswell. I think that's out on DVD."" I nearly fell off my chair, recovering long enough to check. Yes, it's true! One of the all-time greatest teen shows, and a magnificent sci-fi show to boot, is finally out on DVD.Based on the terrific book series, ""Roswell"" chronicles the lives of a group of teens living in Roswell, New Mexico. Some of them are human, some of them are not. You see, it turns out that a spaceship really did crash-land in the New Mexico desert in the 1950's, and after a period of incubation, three kids popped out: Beautiful, head-strong Isabel (Katherine Heigel), proud, rebellious Michael (Brendan Fehr) and quiet, gentle Max (hopelessly gorgeous Jason Behr). One day Max saves the life of Liz Parker (the radiant Shiri Appleby), setting off a chain of events that will change their lives forever. Rounding out the cast is Liz's best friend Maria (Majandra Delfino, providing much of the comedy relief) and geeky Alex (Colin Hanks, son of Tom Hanks). There is also a semi-evil Sheriff and assorted parents and schoolmates.The strength of this show is two-fold: Excellent, heart-felt writing and spectacular chemistry between the leads. The first season is easily the best; later seasons became painful to watch as the characters we had come to care about were tossed about in all the wrong ways. The show always stayed compulsively watchable, though, never losing its poignancy. The first season's the only one I'll be buying, but if you're a newcomer you'll probably be totally hooked and want to see the whole thing through to its satisfying conclusion. Favorite episodes this season include ""Blind Date"", where Max sets impossible-to-match standards for boyfriends everywhere, and ""Independence Day"", which has a wonderful scene of intimacy between a teenage boy and girl that for once isn't all about sex.

Season One is definitely the best the series has to offer, although Season Two is worth checking out, if for no other reason to see the heartbreaking episode, THE END OF THE WORLD.In Season One I challenge anyone to find a pilot with a more gripping, emotional first ten minutes than those of this series.  It grabs you by the throat as Liz Parker is shot and dying in the diner her family owns, and dosen't let go when Max Evans makes the ultimate sacrifice--he risks revealing his alien nature in order to heal the girl he's loved for most of his life.  Of course we don't find out how this scene's pieces fit together, not entirely, until the pilot begins to unfold.  From a glowing silver handprint (which later became an emblem for the series and its fans, right up there with the Tobasco bottles!) to the Crash festival at the end, the series begins as it continues to be for all three seasons: Fun, romantic, very emotionally satisfying...and full of great sci-fi suspense/mystery.My only complaint about the DVD is that many of the original songs from the series have been changed out for inferior choices.

I had wanted to watch it regularly, mostly because of former Star Trek The Next Generation actor Jonathan Frakes association with the show -he was an excutive producer and directed several episodes. But like I said, the first season reminded me of the Creek with aliens. It got boring very quick, and besides, the shows seemed to no where. The show did have an appealing cast, which made it ten times better than Dawson. Jason Behr is hot, and should've been bare chested more often, and I always thought they should've made Nick Wechsler's character gay. I mean, hello, he was way too girlie. Still, he was hot also. Shiri Appleby's Liz and Majandra Delfino's Maria were wonderful, well rounded characters, but William Sadler's Sheriff was silly until he discovers the truth about the guys. All in all, season one was okay. I liked season two, when the show really became a sci fi show. Ironically, most fans did not like that season and when it jumped to UPN for it's third and final season, the show returned more to the Dawson Creek style of story telling. And the Colin Hank's character was missed by then, and well the show never recovered. The show never really found a balance between the sci fi and teen stuff. So the fan base became goofed up by it. There was one camp that liked the love, teen thing, while others didn't mind the teen stuff, but wanted more sci fi. Oh well, I'll still have my Jason Behr in all his digital glory.",4,Roswell -sci fi show or Dawson's Creek II?,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,1563,"['always', 'felt', 'show', 'carried', 'too', 'much', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'angst', 'missed', 'most', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'wanted', 'watch', 'regularly', 'mostly', 'former', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'actor', 'Jonathan', 'Frakes', 'association', 'show', '-he', 'was', 'excutive', 'producer', 'directed', 'several', 'episodes', 'said', 'first', 'season', 'reminded', 'Creek', 'aliens', 'got', 'boring', 'very', 'quick', 'besides', 'shows', 'seemed', 'where', 'show', 'did', 'have', 'appealing', 'cast', 'made', 'times', 'better', 'Dawson', 'Jason', 'Behr', 'hot', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bare', 'chested', 'more', 'often', 'always', 'thought', 'should', ""'ve"", 'made', 'Nick', 'Wechsler', 'character', 'gay', 'mean', 'hello', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'girlie', 'Still', 'was', 'hot', 'also', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'Liz', 'Majandra', 'Delfino', 'Maria', 'were', 'wonderful', 'well', 'rounded', 'characters', 'William', 'Sadler', 'Sheriff', 'was', 'silly', 'truth', 'guys', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'okay', 'liked', 'season', 'two', 'when', 'show', 'really', 'became', 'sci', 'fi', 'show', 'Ironically', 'most', 'fans', 'did', 'not', 'season', 'when', 'jumped', 'UPN', 'third', 'final', 'season', 'show', 'returned', 'more', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'style', 'story', 'telling', 'Colin', 'Hank', 'character', 'was', 'missed', 'then', 'well', 'show', 'never', 'recovered', 'show', 'never', 'really', 'found', 'balance', 'sci', 'fi', 'teen', 'stuff', 'fan', 'base', 'became', 'goofed', 'up', 'was', 'one', 'camp', 'liked', 'love', 'teen', 'thing', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'teen', 'stuff', 'wanted', 'more', 'sci', 'fi', 'Oh', 'well', ""'ll"", 'still', 'have', 'Jason', 'Behr', 'digital', 'glory']",Roswell - The Complete First Season

Gittins,"[11, 23]","I never watched Roswell before I got the DVD, the purchase being based on all the glowing reviews and my ""what the heck"" attitude.That said, here is my review:Decent premise (small group of aliens in hiding.)Good production values. Made a lot from little.Mostly interesting story. Some ""out there"" stuff, though.Some of the relationships seemed forced (such as Maria and Michael - why drag that out so long? He was always a jerk, and she kept coming back, again and again, for nothing...)Adequate acting, but nothing special.Nice geography and geology.The actors and actresses playing high school kids ranged from age 18 to 25. I understand the problems and expense of working with minors, but the cast just seemed way too old for the characters, especially Jason Behr as ""Max"" (25 as 17) and Shiri was 20 as 16...Of course, adolescents always imagine themselves as older, so younger audiences will not notice or care.The women were very attractive, and the guys had attractive hair. In fact ""Michael""'s hair seems to be a supporting character - it certainly had a mind of its own.One problem I had is that when watching several episodes in a row, marathon style, a lot of the little quirks of the characters became annoyances or distractions. I will mention no names, but you know what I'm talking about:1. Knock-knees. The Achilles heel of a beautiful woman.2. Yoda ears. Combined with advanced age and wooden acting was distracting.3. Hair and pout. I understand the hair became some sort of ""thing"", but really, it was pretty bad. It never saw a comb until the last ep or so. Also, an unusual lip purse/jaw drop pout action going most of the time, which was a distraction.4. One voice was irritating. Sorry, it grates after a while and was distracting.The above is not a slam, just an observation that if seen once a week it would probably be fine, but in a condensed version, it becomes quite noticeable.As for the DVD itself. the list of features is misleading.I found no ""gag reel"".Only 1 deleted scene - about 20 seconds - and I could not get a commentary on it.Only 2 ""featurettes"", not 3 - the behind the scenes which was good, and a brief and listless bit with the book authors.The episode commentaries (about 6 in total) were pretty good. Shiri and Majandra giggled through two of them, including the one where they and boyfriends make out a lot - those were the best. The final ep had Jason Katims and the episode director. Unfortunately, Jason had the ""you know"" syndrome pretty bad there, you know.I would not know (never having seen the TV run) nor do I care now, but some of the songs have been changed. I only found this out after watching all 6 discs because when I was putting them in the box, I noticed a paper squished up inside it. It is a message from Jason Katims, the executive producer, apologizing for not being able to afford all the music rights and having to substitute some.I thought about 6 shows were really good, 3 were really bad (for logic/believability/technicality reasons), and the rest were so-so.

783447,A1W0ODR0SK9H4R,B0000TPA6K,LeftManOut,"[4, 5]","Roswell was one of those special shows that came along so unexpectedly for many people. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not much of a Sci-Fi buff, and a show themed about Aliens and Roswell would most likely not be the first to catch my attention. But back in 2000 when I first discovered Roswell, my entire outlook changed. The show was so deep and refreshing, and really different from the same old shows that were all over the WB and Fox at the time, and really captivated an audience. It wasn't just a teen drama, or some sci-fi blast-em-up, it was a very thoughtful and touching story about a group of friends with a huge secret that no one can find out about, and their many challenges in protecting themselves.Ok so your first question is probably ""You didn't give a good enough description, what's the show about?"" Roswell is about a group of six friends, three who are aliens, Max, Micheal and Isabel, and three who are human Liz, Maria and Alex. Max, Micheal and Isabel are from another planet, but do not know where. They crashed on earth in 1948 (the famous rosewell alien crash) and just came out of their ship about 16 years ago. When they emerged from their holding pods, their shipped had been destroyed, and they looked like humans. Their entire life they grow up trying to keep their secret hid. That is until one day when Liz is working in her father's restaraunt, the Crashdown, there is an altercation between two people and a gunshot is fired. Liz is hit by the bullet. Max and Micheal were in the crashdown, and Max uses his powers to save Liz. Max then has to reveal to Liz that he is an alien, and he doesn't know where he is from. The secret soon expands to include Liz's friends Maria and Alex. Season One is perhaps the best season of the show. There are so many memorable moments like when Max is captured by Pierce, Max and the others trying to elude Sheriff Velenti (who eventually becomes a good friend) and The discovery of Tess and Nasato. half-way through the season you'll find out that not everyone else in the ship that Max and the others were in died in the crash, and there is also more aliens on earth, one being Tess, Max's wife from their home planet, although they don't remember eachother. The episodes will quickly grow on you, and whether you watched Roswell back in the day, or just got into to it, you'll fall in love with the episodes all over again. At the end of Season one, there are many questions left unaswered, and we have to wait till season two to get the answers.Unfortunately after three seasons on the air Roswell was cancelled. While I was not at all happy it was ended, I was glad that there was at least a last episode that felt like a last episode. A lot of people say that it didn't get the proper ending and that so many questions were left unanswered, and I agree with that, but at least we didn't get some cliff-hanger that end up just being the last episode and we never found out what happened. I'm still hoping for a Roswell movie like a lot of other people, but they better bring back the original cast. If your a fan of Sci-fi or any kind of teen drama, you're probably going to love Roswell. This one will hold you over till season 3 hits the states sometime in Summer 2005.",5,Finally it has arrived on DVD,1104019200,"12 26, 2004",2004,3254,"['Roswell', 'was', 'one', 'special', 'shows', 'came', 'along', 'so', 'unexpectedly', 'many', 'people', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'Sci-Fi', 'buff', 'show', 'themed', 'Aliens', 'Roswell', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'catch', 'attention', 'back', '2000', 'when', 'first', 'discovered', 'Roswell', 'entire', 'outlook', 'changed', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'deep', 'refreshing', 'really', 'different', 'same', 'old', 'shows', 'were', 'WB', 'Fox', 'time', 'really', 'captivated', 'audience', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'teen', 'drama', 'sci-fi', 'blast-em-up', 'was', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'touching', 'story', 'group', 'friends', 'huge', 'secret', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'about', 'many', 'challenges', 'protecting', 'themselves.Ok', 'so', 'first', 'question', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'good', 'enough', 'description', 'what', 'show', 'Roswell', 'group', 'six', 'friends', 'three', 'who', 'are', 'aliens', 'Max', 'Micheal', 'Isabel', 'three', 'who', 'are', 'human', 'Liz', 'Maria', 'Alex', 'Max', 'Micheal', 'Isabel', 'are', 'planet', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'crashed', 'earth', '1948', 'famous', 'rosewell', 'crash', 'just', 'came', 'ship', '16', 'years', 'ago', 'When', 'emerged', 'holding', 'pods', 'shipped', 'had', 'been', 'destroyed', 'looked', 'humans', 'entire', 'life', 'grow', 'up', 'trying', 'keep', 'secret', 'hid', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'Liz', 'working', 'father', 'restaraunt', 'Crashdown', 'altercation', 'two', 'people', 'gunshot', 'fired', 'Liz', 'hit', 'bullet', 'Max', 'Micheal', 'were', 'crashdown', 'Max', 'powers', 'save', 'Liz', 'Max', 'then', 'reveal', 'Liz', 'alien', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'secret', 'soon', 'include', 'Liz', 'friends', 'Maria', 'Alex', 'Season', 'One', 'perhaps', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'moments', 'when', 'Max', 'captured', 'Pierce', 'Max', 'others', 'trying', 'elude', 'Sheriff', 'Velenti', 'who', 'eventually', 'good', 'friend', 'discovery', 'Tess', 'Nasato', 'half-way', 'season', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'not', 'everyone', 'else', 'ship', 'Max', 'others', 'were', 'died', 'crash', 'also', 'more', 'aliens', 'earth', 'one', 'being', 'Tess', 'Max', 'wife', 'home', 'planet', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'eachother', 'episodes', 'will', 'quickly', 'grow', 'watched', 'Roswell', 'back', 'day', 'just', 'got', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'love', 'episodes', 'over', 'again', 'end', 'Season', 'one', 'are', 'many', 'questions', 'left', 'unaswered', 'have', 'wait', 'till', 'season', 'two', 'get', 'answers.Unfortunately', 'three', 'seasons', 'air', 'Roswell', 'was', 'cancelled', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'was', 'ended', 'was', 'glad', 'was', 'least', 'last', 'episode', 'felt', 'last', 'episode', 'lot', 'people', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'proper', 'ending', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'were', 'left', 'unanswered', 'agree', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'cliff-hanger', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'being', 'last', 'episode', 'never', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'happened', ""'m"", 'still', 'hoping', 'Roswell', 'movie', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'better', 'bring', 'back', 'original', 'cast', 'fan', 'Sci-fi', 'kind', 'teen', 'drama', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'love', 'Roswell', 'one', 'will', 'hold', 'over', 'till', 'season', '3', 'states', 'sometime', 'Summer', '2005']",Roswell - The Complete First Season

I was suprsied to get it because I really didn't push very hard to get it and honestly I had never even watched the show I just thought that there was a slim chance that I might like it.  Boy was I WRONG! I LOVE THE SHOW! From the moment that Liz Parker was shot and then healed by Max Evans I found myself not having the willpower to turn the DVD player off.  The chemistry that Jason Behr(Max) and Sherri Appleby(Liz) have could set a telivision on fire.The Premis of the show is that three teenagers are not normal teeangers at all but in fact aliens from another planet.  I know it sounds rediculous but it plays out much different on screen.  The three aliens reveal their secret to three normal teens who try to assist them from being caught by the FBI or someone worse. In the meantime a obsessed sheriff comes closer to discovering their secret.  In the midst of all of this, the aliens begin to form romantic feelings from some of the humans, something that they swore they would never do.The episodes are extremely intense and will definatly have you on the edge of your seat to say the very least.

My dad had just passed away, and I was extremely depressed for several months. One day I turned on the TV hoping to find a show or movie I could get lost in, when I found Roswell. I fell in love with the show from the get go, mainly because it was the type of show my dad would watch, in fact after telling my brothers and sister about it, they informed me that he had indeed watched it.

Hartmann ""abayyan""","[8, 10]","I am definitely not into teenage angst and rarely watch any show with the young squirts as central figures.But there is something so enticing about the Roswell series that grabs your interest and sustains it with the characters of Max, Michael and Isabel looking for someplace called home.And then Liz & Maria, both working at the Crashdown Cafe along with their teenage buddy [he wants to be, anyway] Alex [Colin Hanks] slowly get involved with Max's secret.What was a bit funny [as per interview on disc 4] the parents are kept in the dark about the comings and goinngs of their teenagers and then brought into the action when emotions intensify between Max and Liz.  Suddenly there seems to be concerns about the kids actions.  [I do love how they are always broken at a most intense scene]Maria is such a flake ball and yet she adds a bit of comic relief to the seriousness of Michael's drive to find his non-human parents.  Whoa! what an explaination is in store for them.Now Nasedo starts showing up and leaving a trail of bodies behind - What is his role in relation to Max, Isabel and Michael?  He is a creepy character.Ah, Sheriff Valenti [William Sadler] he is quite a disbelieving character and a lot has to do with his broken father.  Kyle has a lot to do with him seeing the mistakes he is making.He is slowly coming to realize what Max is up against and ends up needing Max to save Kyle.  A very good turn-about.The characters are woven into a believable community with problems needing to be solved with the teenagers and adults working together.  [well at least some of them].Flake balls and villians - teenage emotions and danger - well paced and excellent acting - all make up for a great series.I would rate it along with many of the classics that are out and continually enjoyed by most viewers.HIGHLY AND DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED **********What would happen to a reunion that is dated 5 years from the conclusion?????

Unfortunely for me, at the time, i was into X-files (though my interest in that show was slowly slipping) and the teen-supernatural monster hit that was Buffy.A show about aliens that look like teens didn't interest me and i really thought the show would be a mix between X-files and 90210. I remember watching about 5 min of one epsiode of Roswell while it was on tv and switched over pretty quickly as i jsut didn't get it nor allowed myself too.Cut to 2005 and me bored senseless, flipping the cable networks and coming across the pilot episode for Roswell. I was on the computer chatting to friends and just put it on for back ground.I'm a hardcore Buffy fan and really didn't think anything could compete with this obsession.Anyho, i missed the first 5 min of the pilot and came into it just as Max and Co were getting ready to leave Roswell as they had been exposed somehow ( i didn't know why at the time).I was glued!!!!!! I mean glueddddddddddddddd to the show. All else around me faded and i became, in no less than 30 min, a Roswell fan. The show was not 90210 or the X-files. My god, it had drama, intrigue and characters that i immedtially attached too (primarily Max and Liz).So, the pilot show ended and so did my net chatting for the day as i got in my car and rented the entire Season One and returned home. I watched the pilot again, this time seeing the shooting that begins this whole drama and the envolvement of the characters.Then over the course of a week I proceeded to watch the whole season ( i would have easily watched the whole lot in one sitting but unfortunely having to live my real life interferred).As i watched - what started as a keen interest became a obsession and now i just can't stop thinking about Roswell. After each absorbing episode i thought to myself ....why, WHY didn't i give this a go when it was on televison and could actually have added to the ratings with the slight hope that my 00000000000.00000.1 percent rating would keep the show alive, (well one can hope).Thankgod now days for DVD releases that allow one to watch these sort of series at yah own pace.So, what makes this show stand out to me !!!!First of the show is not just for teens but for many age groups that have or are waiting to experience their first love. Furthermore, the show is dramatic with an excellent sci-fi flair/story. Sure the kids are aliens and sure they are teenagers but this is just represention of the emotions and identity confusion that occurs for all of us at this stage of life and for some way into adulthood.Yes they are aliens but the thing is they are also half human and it is these emotions that the first half of season one explores with great script writing and character development.However, it does have a sci-fi element to it (of course) and this really kicks in about half way through season one with a greater emphasis on the alien mystery element of the series.Thus, because the series has invested alot of time in character development and serious emotional drama the sci-fi is complimented in a way that makes you sit clued to every episode regardless of whehter sci-fi interest you or not. Meaning you are not only attached to the character but also the envolving mystery and story.ANDDDDDDDDD... the mystery actually MEANS something to the viewer because of the way all the characters interact. A good example of this is the Sheriff characters (who aint a teen) who goes through a transformation during the series. Never was i as emotional as i was when he declared to Max that he would do anything for him and this only occurred due to what preceeded it.Furthermore, the series has an on-going story arc that you want with series televison. Infact two. A love story (and not a sappy one that doesn't work but one that really hits the notes) and the discovery of where, who and why there are 3 aliens living in Roswell (actully make that 4 but i won't spoil anything).Both story arc's compliment each other and make the series both compelling and completely addictive.I'm not gunna do a huge comprasion to this show with Buffy but will say that Roswell is FAR more dramatic than Buffy which tended to have lighter episodes with drama than just drama , drama and drama (though BUFFY ROCKS). And i won't even compare Roswell to Smallville (which is childish, monster of the week type fair with none of the emotional reasonce that Roswell has).Honestly, i cried, yelled, covered my eyes and shook my hands at the screen while watching this series. I was just that much emotionally connected with the series.In regards to the casting of the show......brillant (yeah Tess can be a bit meh but so far i like her). By far for me the stand out was Jason Behr as Max.So , here i am eating some humble pie. The show that i though would be eck is actually great and i should have given this a better chance when it first aired commerically.Roswell is perfect viewing and will hit (if not already) cult status. I highly recommended this series to anyone and promise it is not 90210 mixed with X-files. It a compelling drama with characters you will like and a story arc that will keep you interested. Furthermore, you might find you reality becoming more and more faded as you continue to excape into the world of Roswell.Simply Brillant - BUY IT NOW !!!!!",5,Humble Pie !!!!,1107129600,"01 31,

783465,AV5H2I9CHN8YI,B0000TPA6K,N. Gregg,"[0, 3]","I love sci-fi. When I watched the pilot episode of this show I thought I was going to be hooked (in spite of the fact that the casting was way too old to pass as HS students, and the wardrobe/makeup dept. did nothing to help hide that fact, and there is no soundtrack to help things either) -- there seemed to be good potential here.Unfortunately, by the end of episode 5 I've had enough.  The writing/acting is very dull, boring and overall somewhat depressing.  There has been little to no suspense, thrill or intrigue since the 2nd episode.

At first I was skeptical watching a TV show about Aliens in high School. After reading the many reviews here on Amazon I figured it had to be a good show with all the positive reviews it had received. I finally ended up buying this ROSWELL Season 1 DVD box set without ever even seeing a single episode. Now after almost 1 week of watching the entire first season I can now say this is now one of my favorite TV shows. What I really like about Roswell is that even though it is somewhat of a love story it has so many other elements to it. The show takes you on a journey, and as you go through each episode you find yourself growing more and more attached to the characters as they go on their own emotional journey and self discovery. Max (Jason Behr) and Liz (Shiri Appleby) just light up the screen with the great chemistry they share. Maria and Michael also have a chemistry that just works perfect even though they seem to always be fighting. I have discovered one of the best shows with Roswell, and I can not wait till season 2 and season 3 are released on DVD.

783474,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000TPA6K,Robert Moore,"[1, 2]","I did not watch this series at all when it was first broadcasting and until recently had no intention to watch it.  Although it is obviously getting some good reviews here, it is not a television series that enjoys a good reputation.  I suspect the poor reputation has been generated primarily by people who haven't seen it.  The dislike of many of those who haven't seen it is based entirely on the premise:  high school kids who are also aliens.  I will grant that that is not necessarily a good premise, but it is more what someone does with a premise than anything.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is an equally unpromising premise, but if there has ever been a better show than BUFFY I'd like to see it.  LOST, on the other hand, has a great premise and is doing a superb job of spinning out that premise.  ROSWELL, I would suggest, especially in its first season, is another show that has done a great job with a not-necessarily-all-that-great premise.The success of THE X-FILES and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER created a demand for more shows along the same lines in the late 1990s.  Just as FOX responded to BUFFY by developing DARK ANGEL, so the WB's immediate response to their own BUFFY was to develop two additional shows along the same line:  CHARMED and ROSWELL.  They even tried to tap into the BUFFY crowd by making the lead of ROSWELL Jason Behr, who had guest starred in an especially memorable Season Two episode of BUFFY, the super ""Lie to Me,"" where he played a former boyfriend of Buffy who was dying from an incurable disease and hoped to become a vampire by betraying the Slayer.  It could have been a silly episode, but it ended up a wonderful meditation on life, death, betrayal, and human nature.  Behr was perfect for the role of Max (a role that Heath Ledger auditioned for).  Although BUFFY created the demand for ROSWELL and shaped the form it would take on TV, the concept itself came from a series of novels directed at pre-teen girls.  The novels clearly exploited the imaginative universe generated by THE X-FILES.  If one tried to say what ROSWELL was like, one would not be wrong in saying it was part BUFFY, part THE X-FILES, and part ROMEO AND JULIET.  The latter comes out in the seemingly impossible love between Max and Liz Parker.  If the Capulets and Montagues created problems for Romeo and Juliet, that was nothing compared to Max's alien relations and Liz's human status.One thing I love about the show is its approach to narrative.  The 1980s saw the birth and development of the multi-thread television show, beginning with the groundbreaking HILL STREET BLUES.  But what is rarely noted is the way the 1990s gave birth to a new form of series where there was not only multiple story arcs, but a master narrative that extended beyond the individual smaller arcs and gave them their context.  The pioneering show for this genre was TWIN PEAKS and was extended by THE X-FILES and perfected by BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  ROSWELL is wonderful for having virtually no stand alone episodes.  Each episode is intelligible only in the context of the narrative as a whole.  Networks are leery of such formats.  They are great at creating a passionate fan base, but the ongoing narratives makes it difficult for newcomers to catch up on what is happening.  ROSWELL appeared immediately before the now standard practice of bringing out on DVD the previous season near the beginning of the new year, making it far easier for new fans to catch up.  ROSWELL both benefited and was hurt by this format.  It benefited in that the first season was superb narrative television as we got to know the characters, witness the interplay between them, get involved in a number of mysteries, and just speculate in general on what was going to happen.  It was hurt as in subsequent seasons the narrative often became more than a tad silly.  But regardless of what happened in Seasons 2 and 3, Season 1 is a very good season.The narrative is driven by events that occurred one day in the Crashdown Caf&eacute;.  Liz Parker, a waitress in the caf&eacute; her parents own, is shot in the stomach by a stray bullet from the gun of two customers who get in a fight.  Her wound appears to be fatal until Max, a mysterious classmate of Liz's and someone who has nursed a crush on her for years, rushes up to her, places his hand over her stomach, and magically removes the bullet and heals the wound.  Although she and Max try to make it seem that she hadn't really been shot, but that the bullet had broken a ketchup bottle that doused her, the event awakens the interest of a number of people, including the alien hunter section of the FBI as well as the local sheriff.  From this event all the events of the next three years spins.The show is graced by an excellent cast.  Shiri Apppleby is adorable as Liz and Jason Behr is great as Max (as well as serving as a heartthrob for a host of adolescent girls during the show's run, despite his Clark Gable-like ears).  The beautiful Katherine Heigl, well before her resurfacing on GREY'S ANATOMY, plays Max's sister Isabel.  The third main alien Michael is played by Brendan Fehr.  These three are later joined by a fourth alien played by the remarkably beautiful Australian actress Emilie de Ravin, who was barely able to disguise her accent.  Like Heigl, she has gone on to fame on a highly successful TV show, playing Claire on LOST (and a much more likable character to boot).  The main humans are rounded out by Majandra Delfino as Liz's best friend Maria and Colin Hanks as Alex.  Ironically Liz's pretty vanilla dad is played by the great rocker John Doe, the front man for the important LA punk band X.  For my money, the best performer on the show is William Sadler as Sheriff Valenti.  Sadler, who has more recently been memorable as the less-than-ten-seconds virtuoso in KINSEY and as Jaye's dad in WONDERFALLS, is great as someone who is initially Max's enemy but eventually his friend and protector.  As is typical of modern TV shows, virtually all of the high school students are portrayed by performers in their mid to late twenties.This is not a perfect show.  Near the end of the season it begins lapsing into slightly silly plotlines and at times it descends a bit too far into high school soap opera mode, but for the most part it manages to be a very well written and immersive extended narrative.  Unless one is irremediably opposed to shows set in high school or shows dealing with Sci-fi or the supernatural, I can't imagine many TV fans being disappointed by this show.  I certainly was not.  I have also enjoyed the following two seasons, though I think neither as good as season one.  I just found the interplanetary plot lines just a bit hard to swallow.  The show remained worth watching to the end, but I regret that it didn't maintain the tone of Season One.  Still, watch it.",5,"I started as a sceptic, but the show really won me over",1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,6862,"['did', 'not', 'watch', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcasting', 'recently',

Viewers of ""The Creek"" will remember him as Chris, the ""rico suave"" who acted in one of Dawson's movies. Apparently, ""the powers that be"" saw potential in Behr, thus Jason Katim's sci-fi teen drama was developed and formed around him. More recently, The Creek did the same thing for Chad Michael Murray, currently of One Tree Hill.Immediately engaging and involving, Roswell raised the bar somewhat for teen dramas with an incredible cast, original storylines, and a near-perfect balance of sci-fi elements and teen angst. There's no wonder why so many have so much to express about the phenomenon that is Roswell. Life was good for Roswell until it started losing support during it's 2nd season due to what TV Guide Couch Critic Matt Roush called ""convoluted storylines."" ""Too much stuff going on,"" he said. Yeah, right. In any case, WB dropped Roswell (along with Buffy) from it's schedule. Luckily, UPN picked up Roswell (along with Buffy) for the show's 3rd and final season. For its worth, Roswell went out fighting like a champ (along with my other canceled favorite of that year, ABC's Once & Again) with one of television's better series finales.

783481,A149PLF9RX9DMX,B0000TPA6K,Shanna R. Mullen,"[3, 5]","My sister got me interested in this show after it had been cancelled, and as I watched the episodes in reruns, out of order, I began to love it.  Ironically, this is one show that I love but in which I can't say that I have a favourite character; but not one of them is anyone I could stand to see go.  Max Evans, played, may I say, to perfection by Jason Behr, is an alien.  A teenage, too-serious, controlling, confused, kind, humanoid alien with healing (and a few other here and there) powers.  And he's in love with a human girl--Liz Parker, played by Shiri Appleby.  She's a scientist, a writer, a thinker, and like many, if not all, teenage girls, is unsure of herself.  She's often joined by her best friend Maria DeLuca, played by Majandra Delfino, who's a bit quirky, a bit of a flower child, also a bit unsure of herself, but quite independent.  Max's sister Isabel, played by Katherine Heigl, is an outwardly aloof, seemingly all-too-sure of herself alien, trying to keep the world she's formed together.  Oh, and you know, she can walk into people's dreams.  Michael Guerin, the last of the alien trio, played by Brendan Fehr, is impetuous, temperamental, highly independent, and fiercely loyal-and he can open a locked door by zapping it with his hand.  Alex Whitman, played by Colin Hanks, plays the part of Liz and Maria's slightly geeky, gawky, platonic male best friend.  Sheriff James Valenti, played, again, to perfection by William Sadler, is the seeming antagonist, and also the father of Liz's boyfriend Kyle, played by Nick Wechsler, the ""jock"" and also potential antagonist.All of these characters are extremely well-portrayed throughout the series; the characters always feel three-dimentional, never static.  The guest stars are also richly played; season one's highlights include Julie Benz as Kathleen Topolsky, Kevin Weisman (of later Alias fame) as Larry, John Doe as Liz's father Jeff Parker (who's in all three seasons), and David Conrad as Agent Pierce.The premise of the series is the ""Romeo and Juliet""esque relationship of Liz and Max after her accidental shooting and his subsequent healing of her, which leads to the careful wall of secrecy the three aliens have built around their alien identities being shattered.  Of course, there's more to it than that, but that's the synopsis in one run-on sentence.Bottom line:  it's my favourite show ever, and I can't put my finger on exactly why.  I can, however, put my finger on why I love it; great, relatable, well-acted characters, great episodes (Did you know the pilot episode was the highest-rated pilot 20th Century Fox had ever shown?  True.).  Watch it for yourself and see.DVD comments:  1 deleted scene, seemingly randomly chosen; 6 commentaries (1 per disc), including 2 by Shiri Appleby (Liz) and Majandra Delfino (Maria); 2 interesting ""featurettes""; Emilie de Ravin's (Tess) audition tape; music video by Sense Field featuring Shiri Appleby (Liz) (doesn't feature her as Liz or have anything to do with Roswell, although apparently Sense Field ""wrote many of the songs featured in Roswell"" . . . I found its being on the DVD odd); one thing I really liked was that the executive producer, Jason Katims, included a note explaining that ""many of the songs have been replaced with alternative choices,"" and that although he was among those who fought the change, it was either that or not release the DVD due to cost, and they picked new songs that they think ""work as well, if not better, than the originals""-noting that they did keep those songs they felt essential to the show (I enjoyed the songs played on the DVD, for the record)",5,"Can you say ""teen alien sci-fi semi-soap opera romance drama"" ten times fast?",1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,3631,"['sister', 'got', 'interested', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'cancelled', 'watched', 'episodes', 'reruns', 'order', 'began', 'love', 'Ironically', 'one', 'show', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', 'favourite', 'character', 'not', 'one', 'anyone', 'could', 'stand', 'see', 'go', 'Max', 'Evans', 'played', 'may', 'say', 'perfection', 'Jason', 'Behr', 'alien', 'teenage', 'too-serious', 'controlling', 'confused', 'kind', 'humanoid', 'alien', 'healing', 'few', 'other', 'here', 'there', 'powers', 'love', 'human', 'girl', 'Liz', 'Parker', 'played', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'scientist', 'writer', 'thinker', 'many', 'not', 'teenage', 'girls', 'unsure', 'herself', 'often', 'joined', 'best', 'friend', 'Maria', 'DeLuca', 'played', 'Majandra', 'Delfino', 'who', 'bit', 'quirky', 'bit', 'flower', 'child', 'also', 'bit', 'unsure', 'herself', 'quite', 'independent', 'Max', 'sister', 'Isabel', 'played', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'outwardly', 'aloof', 'seemingly', 'all-too-sure', 'alien', 'trying', 'keep', 'world', 'formed', 'together', 'Oh', 'know', 'can', 'walk', 'people', 'dreams', 'Michael', 'Guerin', 'last', 'alien', 'trio', 'played', 'Brendan', 'Fehr', 'impetuous', 'temperamental', 'highly', 'independent', 'fiercely', 'loyal-and', 'can', 'open', 'locked', 'door', 'zapping', 'hand', 'Alex', 'Whitman', 'played', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'part', 'Liz', 'Maria', 'slightly', 'geeky', 'gawky', 'platonic', 'male', 'best', 'friend', 'Sheriff', 'James', 'Valenti', 'played', 'again', 'perfection', 'William', 'Sadler', 'seeming', 'antagonist', 'also', 'father', 'Liz', 'boyfriend', 'Kyle', 'played', 'Nick', 'Wechsler', 'jock', 'also', 'potential', 'antagonist.All', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'well-portrayed', 'series', 'characters', 'always', 'feel', 'three-dimentional', 'never', 'static', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'also', 'richly', 'played', 'season', 'one', 'highlights', 'include', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'Kathleen', 'Topolsky', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'later', 'Alias', 'fame', 'Larry', 'John', 'Doe', 'Liz', 'father', 'Jeff', 'Parker', 'who', 'three', 'seasons', 'David', 'Conrad', 'Agent', 'Pierce.The', 'premise', 'series', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'esque', 'relationship', 'Liz', 'Max', 'accidental', 'shooting', 'subsequent', 'healing', 'careful', 'wall', 'secrecy', 'three', 'aliens', 'have', 'built', 'alien', 'identities', 'being', 'shattered', 'course', 'more', 'synopsis', 'one', 'run-on', 'sentence.Bottom', 'line', 'favourite', 'show', 'ever', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'exactly', 'why', 'can', 'however', 'put', 'finger', 'why', 'love', 'great', 'relatable', 'well-acted', 'characters', 'great', 'episodes', 'Did', 'know', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'highest-rated', 'pilot', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'had', 'ever', 'shown', 'True.', 'Watch', 'see.DVD', 'comments', '1', 'deleted', 'scene', 'seemingly', 'randomly', 'chosen', '6', 'commentaries', '1', 'disc', 'including', '2', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'Liz', 'Majandra', 'Delfino', 'Maria', '2', 'interesting', 'featurettes', 'Emilie', 'Ravin', 'Tess', 'audition', 'tape', 'music', 'video', 'Sense', 'Field', 'featuring', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'Liz', ""n't"", 'feature', 'Liz', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'Roswell', 'apparently', 'Sense', 'Field', 'wrote', 'many', 'songs', 'featured', 'Roswell', 'found', 'being', 'DVD', 'odd', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'executive', 'producer', 'Jason', 'Katims', 'included', 'note', 'explaining', 'many', 'songs', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'alternative', 'choices', 'was', 'who', 'fought', 'change', 'was', 'not', 'release', 'DVD', 'due', 'cost', 'picked', 'new', 'songs', 'think', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'better', 'originals', '-noting', 'did', 'keep', 'songs', 'felt', 'essential', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'songs', 'played', 'DVD', 'record']",Roswell - The Complete First Season

Anyways, it quickly unravels that during that legendary crash years ago there were 3 pods (4 but they dont know it) which contained small children (alien children) and they were found roaming naked later on and taken in as humans to be raised as such. thats the basic plot of the show. starting with her and slowly growing a small band of people who have to decide to protect their new ""otherworldly"" friends. i especially loved the scene in the pilot where their having the annual crash party and they set off the space crash gag while everyone jumps around cheering and partying in space suits where the 3 ""left behind"" watch the gag obviously taking it in a very different way.well, from that episode on i was hooked. great tv show and you really cant beat the price. i could watch these over and over again and now im trying to get my mom into it. The characters are quite colorful and as time goes on this shows got some great and memorable lines.",5,better late than never,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,1989,"['didnt', 'have', 'tv', 'back', 'day', 'show', 'came', 'out', 'later', 'life', 'when', 'i', 'started', 'watching', 'tv', 'i', 'got', 'couple', 'wb', 'type', 'shows', 'then', 'i', 'saw', 'picture', 'roswell', 'ive', 'always', 'loved', 'stuff', 'aliens', 'i', 'katherine', 'heigl', 'greys', 'anatomy', 'so', 'i', 'decided', 'watch', 'episode', 'then', 'okay', 'not', 'then', 'dont', 'worry', 'so', 'i', 'downloaded', 'tv', 'gave', 'shot', 'wb', 'show', 'good', 'music', 'times', 'cute', 'stories', 'going', 'whole', 'package', 'magical', 'almost', 'E.T', 'twist.In', 'roswell', 'new', 'mexico', 'aliens', 'are', 'big', 'deal', 'years', 'back', 'said', 'space', 'ship', 'crashed', 'man', 'died', 'ever', 'then', 'town', 'been', 'obsessed', 'aliens', 'almost', 'point', 'being', 'tourist', 'attraction', 'one', 'day', 'diner', 'confrontation', 'where', 'one', 'man', 'gun', 'waitress', 'fatally', 'shot', 'boy', 'up', 'then', 'fine', 'up', 'harm', 'done', 'Thats', 'when', 'show', 'really', 'started', 'who', 'boy', 'what', 'earh', 'pun', 'intended', 'did', 'do', 'her', 'Anyways', 'quickly', 'legendary', 'crash', 'years', 'ago', 'were', '3', 'pods', '4', 'dont', 'know', 'contained', 'small', 'children', 'alien', 'children', 'were', 'found', 'roaming', 'naked', 'later', 'taken', 'as', 'humans', 'be', 'raised', 'such', 'thats', 'basic', 'plot', 'show', 'starting', 'slowly', 'growing', 'small', 'band', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'decide', 'protect', 'new', 'otherworldly', 'friends', 'i', 'especially', 'loved', 'scene', 'pilot', 'where', 'having', 'annual', 'crash', 'party', 'set', 'off', 'space', 'crash', 'gag', 'everyone', 'jumps', 'cheering', 'partying', 'space', 'suits', 'where', '3', 'left', 'behind', 'watch', 'gag', 'obviously', 'taking', 'very', 'different', 'way.well', 'episode', 'i', 'was', 'hooked', 'great', 'tv', 'show', 'really', 'cant', 'beat', 'price', 'i', 'could', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'now', 'im', 'trying', 'get', 'mom', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'colorful', 'time', 'shows', 'got', 'great', 'memorable', 'lines']",Roswell - The Complete First Season

783502,AP3B615GM191G,B0000TPA6K,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","I bought this first season of &#34;Roswell&#34; as a gift for my 15-year old sister, thinking that her and I could watch it together.  After the first two discs, I was done with the teen drama and sluggish dialogue/plots.  She finished the entire season in the span of a weekend.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Roswell&#34; is set up by a shooting in a cafe outside Roswell, New Mexico.  Teenage waitress Liz Parker (Shiri Appleby) is hit by a stray bullet by then miraculous healed by fellow high school student Max Evans (Jason Behr).  What Liz quickly discovers is that Max, along with sister Isabel (Katherine Heigl) and friend Michael (Brendan Fehr), is an alien with special powers of healing and insight.I had a hunch that this show would appeal to the teen set, and I was completely right on that front.  It's simple plotlines, love triangles, and cast of beautiful people easily hooked in my sister.  She can't get enough of it!For me, though, I thought that the &#34;alien/conspiracy&#34; aspect (being a big fan of X-Files-type fare) would be more interesting.  However, it is just too slow-moving and badly acted (at least in the early goings) for me to stick with it.I rarely review something like this until I &#34;finish the experience&#34;, but after about eight episodes I had had enough.  Maybe the show gets better in the later episodes (from the little bits of caught of my sister watching that seems to be at least somewhat the case) and I &#34;jumped ship&#34; too early.  Regardless, this is a show almost completely marketed to and created for teens, so if you can't stomach that sort of drama then I wouldn't bother with it.",2,Almost Exclusively For Teens (And Probably Teen Girls At That),1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,1648,"['bought', 'first', 'season', '34', 'Roswell', '34', 'gift', '15-year', 'old', 'sister', 'thinking', 'could', 'watch', 'together', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'was', 'done', 'teen', 'drama', 'sluggish', 'dialogue/plots', 'finished', 'entire', 'season', 'span', 'weekend.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Roswell', '34', 'set', 'up', 'shooting', 'cafe', 'outside', 'Roswell', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Teenage', 'waitress', 'Liz', 'Parker', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'hit', 'stray', 'bullet', 'then', 'miraculous', 'healed', 'fellow', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Max', 'Evans', 'Jason', 'Behr', 'What', 'Liz', 'quickly', 'Max', 'sister', 'Isabel', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'friend', 'Michael', 'Brendan', 'Fehr', 'alien', 'special', 'powers', 'healing', 'insight.I', 'had', 'hunch', 'show', 'would', 'appeal', 'teen', 'set', 'was', 'completely', 'right', 'front', 'simple', 'plotlines', 'love', 'triangles', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'people', 'easily', 'hooked', 'sister', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'thought', '34', 'alien/conspiracy', '34', 'aspect', 'being', 'big', 'fan', 'X-Files-type', 'fare', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'However', 'just', 'too', 'slow-moving', 'badly', 'acted', 'least', 'early', 'goings', 'stick', 'it.I', 'rarely', 'review', 'something', '34', 'finish', 'experience', '34', 'about', 'eight', 'episodes', 'had', 'had', 'enough', 'Maybe', 'show', 'better', 'later', 'episodes', 'little', 'bits', 'caught', 'sister', 'watching', 'be', 'least', 'somewhat', 'case', '34', 'jumped', 'ship', '34', 'too', 'early', 'Regardless', 'show', 'almost', 'completely', 'marketed', 'created', 'teens', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'sort', 'drama', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother']",Roswell - The Complete First Season
