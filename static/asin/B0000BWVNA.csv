771567,A24PTVSZSM8968,B0000BWVNA,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","This movie's title suggests that it's about Mecca, but in reality it's more about the Hajj, a celebration that completely defines Mecca in any case. It is an hour-long documentary that does a pretty good job of combining a brief historical introduction to the Hajj and the origins of various traditions within the Hajj on the one hand, and a travel diary of three different pilgrims to the Hajj on the other. It follows an American convert to Islam, a South African black Muslim and an Asian Muslim from Malaysia as they prepare for the Hajj and then travel to Mecca to complete the Hajj. The cameras actually follow them through the various stages which provides a very interesting look at a ritual that non-Muslims cannot see personally because of the prohibition against non-Muslims entering Mecca. In some ways, the documentary focuses a bit more on the personal experiences of the pilgrims more than the nuts and bolts of the Hajj itself and as such, it may be hard for a viewer to get a good academic summary of the different parts of the Hajj, but the invaluable part of the film is the view of the actual circumstances on the ground which are sometimes hard to visualize if one studies the Hajj from an academic perspective. It turns out that the Hajj is both a powerful spiritual experience second to almost none and a strenuous physical and mental experience that tests pilgrims' fortitude. One the one hand you can see the heightened emotional response of the pilgrims that finally get to visit the center of their faith during one of the most important rituals of their faith and on the other hand you can see the stress of dealing with a couple million fellow pilgrims and the logistical nightmares it involves. I highly recommend this documentary, at least as a starting point, if you are interesting in learning a bit more about the Hajj and why Mecca is so important to the Muslim faith.",5,Great chance to see what the Hajj looks like,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,1903,"['movie', 'title', 'Mecca', 'reality', 'more', 'Hajj', 'celebration', 'completely', 'Mecca', 'case', 'hour-long', 'documentary', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'combining', 'brief', 'historical', 'introduction', 'Hajj', 'origins', 'various', 'traditions', 'Hajj', 'one', 'hand', 'travel', 'diary', 'three', 'different', 'pilgrims', 'Hajj', 'other', 'American', 'convert', 'Islam', 'South', 'African', 'black', 'Muslim', 'Asian', 'Muslim', 'Malaysia', 'prepare', 'Hajj', 'then', 'travel', 'Mecca', 'complete', 'Hajj', 'cameras', 'actually', 'follow', 'various', 'stages', 'very', 'interesting', 'look', 'ritual', 'non-Muslims', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'personally', 'prohibition', 'non-Muslims', 'entering', 'Mecca', 'ways', 'documentary', 'bit', 'more', 'personal', 'experiences', 'pilgrims', 'more', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'Hajj', 'such', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'viewer', 'get', 'good', 'academic', 'summary', 'different', 'parts', 'Hajj', 'invaluable', 'part', 'film', 'view', 'actual', 'circumstances', 'ground', 'are', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'visualize', 'one', 'studies', 'Hajj', 'academic', 'perspective', 'out', 'Hajj', 'powerful', 'spiritual', 'experience', 'second', 'almost', 'none', 'strenuous', 'physical', 'mental', 'experience', 'pilgrims', 'fortitude', 'One', 'one', 'hand', 'can', 'see', 'heightened', 'emotional', 'response', 'pilgrims', 'finally', 'get', 'visit', 'center', 'faith', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'rituals', 'faith', 'other', 'hand', 'can', 'see', 'stress', 'dealing', 'couple', 'million', 'fellow', 'pilgrims', 'logistical', 'nightmares', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'least', 'starting', 'point', 'are', 'interesting', 'learning', 'bit', 'more', 'Hajj', 'why', 'Mecca', 'so', 'important', 'Muslim', 'faith']",N/A
