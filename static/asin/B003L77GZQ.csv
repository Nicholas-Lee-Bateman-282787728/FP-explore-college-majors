Every year since, it's been disappointing to see Fox ignore the HD market and release this and just about all of their other TV properties on low definition DVD only - overly compressed DVD at that.  As such, I've been forced to rent - or rather buy and resell, since Hollywood Video bought out all the local rental outlets and has now closed up shop too - seasons 1, 3, and now 4.  TV on DVD taught me, years ago, that watching television is much more enjoyable on disc, when you don't have to wait a week or a month for the next installment, not to mention let the schizophrenic networks - who change air times like hats - dictate when I have to watch.  I'd love to complete my collection of this show, but just can't see spending money on outdated tech, when the entire industry went high def years ago.

I love the background of the show(sunny Miami) and all the pretty people (especially when you live in a snowy part of the region, its delightful to watch) I particularly like FIONA. She is one fearless woman; only weakened by her love for Michael and he her(which can at times weakens him), but that's true to life I think.

It remains one of the freshest shows in some time with characters that you find yourself not just rooting for but loving along the way. And season four is no different than the pervious three; it remains a great show.An intro for those who haven't been watching: Michael Weston (Jeffrey Donovan) is a spy for the U.S. who suddenly finds himself burned. By burned we mean that he's taken off the list of active spies and tossed aside with no money, no identity and no history, left in whatever town he was in when he was burned. In this case it's Miami and fortunately for him he has friends there: an ex-girlfriend Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar) who's ex-IRA with a nasty temper, Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell) an old SEAL buddy who sold info on Michel to the FBI and his mother Madeline (Sharon Gless), a chain smoking woman who loves her son but is greatly aggravated in learning what he did for a living. Left to his own devices, Michael and his friends help people in trouble using their talents when no one else will help. At the same time, Weston continues to search for whoever it was that burned him in an attempt to get back into the spy game. Got it?At the end of season three we had Michael saving the life of the man who burned him and capturing a serial killing maniac who was once a spy just like Michael. But Michael broke a few laws to catch him and is now a prisoner himself, held in a lock up that's not the normal kind. Instead Michael is introduced to a new ""friend"", a man who says that he wants to assist Michael in finding out just who is behind a secret global attack on the country, a person or group that is doing damage from within. Michael agrees to help but at the same time still distrust everyone but his friends.As the season opens, Michael is given a pass card to gain access to a federal building to obtain information. Before leaving he witnesses the man whose card he had, a spy named Jesse Porter (Coby Bell), being escorted from the building. Michael has just burned another spy, doing to them what was done to him.Keeping an eye on Porter in the hopes of gaining information, Michael discovers another person in need of assistance and takes on Porter's case. As it moves forward Porter eventually tells Michael that like him he was burned and that his sole motivation now is to find the man that burned him and kill him. So naturally Michael takes Porter under his wing and adds him to the team. So much so that he eventually finds a place for him to live: with his mother in the garage.The season continues on with various people coming into the scene in need of help. At the same time Michael and the group continue to seek out the truth behind what is going on in the spy world, who is burning whom, how all of it fits together and keep Porter from discovering that Michael was the man who burned him. By the end who knows, perhaps Michael can discover who he was burned by...but then Porter might find out as well.Each story features the client and subsequent rescue by the team but at the same time adds bits and pieces to the main puzzle that Michael has been going with since episode one. The amazing thing is that each episode while telling these concurrent stories is filled with action, adventure and an actual story to boot.The acting...I've said it before and I'll say it again, this entire team here is a perfect fit. If one were to disappear it would be felt not just by the characters but the viewers as well. They just gel together better than most. That's rare for most TV series but lately it seems like more thought is going into making a fantastic ensemble in shows than in the past. I honestly can't imagine this show without the entire team intact.The new season of this series is about to begin soon. Picking up all four of the previous sets can only help to not just increase your awareness of the show but make you a fan as well. Then you can sit back with the rest of us, waiting in anticipation each week to find out what new case they will assist with and who is behind the whole burn notice plot.While discovering TV series on DVD is a great thing (and I've often talked about how wonderful it is to get into an entire season rather than waiting for the cliffhanger each week) the fact remains that TV needs viewers to keep a show on the air. For me the important thing about the DVD sets is that you can miss a season or half of it, watch the DVD and catch up in time to get back on once more. While BURN NOTICE may not be on one of the three major networks, it goes to show that the cable stations are becoming the place to go when looking for quality programming. Give this series a shot and my guess is you'll be hooked.",5,THE PLOT THICKENS,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,4787,"[""'ve"", 'said', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'change', 'opinion', 'one', 'freshest', 'shows', 'time', 'characters', 'find', 'not', 'just', 'rooting', 'loving', 'way', 'season', 'four', 'different', 'pervious', 'three', 'great', 'show.An', 'intro', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'watching', 'Michael', 'Weston', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'spy', 'U.S.', 'who', 'suddenly', 'burned', 'burned', 'mean', 'taken', 'off', 'list', 'active', 'spies', 'tossed', 'aside', 'money', 'identity', 'history', 'left', 'town', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'burned', 'case', 'Miami', 'fortunately', 'friends', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Fiona', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'who', 'ex-IRA', 'nasty', 'temper', 'Sam', 'Axe', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'old', 'SEAL', 'buddy', 'who', 'sold', 'info', 'Michel', 'FBI', 'mother', 'Madeline', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'chain', 'smoking', 'woman', 'who', 'son', 'greatly', 'aggravated', 'learning', 'what', 'did', 'living', 'Left', 'own', 'devices', 'Michael', 'friends', 'help', 'people', 'trouble', 'using', 'talents', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'help', 'same', 'time', 'Weston', 'search', 'whoever', 'was', 'burned', 'attempt', 'get', 'back', 'spy', 'game', 'Got', 'end', 'season', 'three', 'had', 'Michael', 'saving', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'burned', 'capturing', 'serial', 'killing', 'maniac', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'spy', 'just', 'Michael', 'Michael', 'broke', 'few', 'laws', 'catch', 'now', 'prisoner', 'held', 'lock', 'up', 'not', 'normal', 'kind', 'Instead', 'Michael', 'introduced', 'new', 'friend', 'man', 'who', 'assist', 'Michael', 'finding', 'out', 'just', 'who', 'secret', 'global', 'attack', 'country', 'person', 'group', 'doing', 'damage', 'Michael', 'help', 'same', 'time', 'still', 'distrust', 'everyone', 'friends.As', 'season', 'Michael', 'given', 'pass', 'card', 'gain', 'access', 'federal', 'building', 'obtain', 'information', 'leaving', 'man', 'card', 'had', 'spy', 'named', 'Jesse', 'Porter', 'Coby', 'Bell', 'being', 'escorted', 'building', 'Michael', 'just', 'burned', 'spy', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'him.Keeping', 'eye', 'Porter', 'hopes', 'gaining', 'information', 'Michael', 'person', 'need', 'assistance', 'Porter', 'case', 'forward', 'Porter', 'eventually', 'Michael', 'was', 'burned', 'sole', 'motivation', 'now', 'find', 'man', 'burned', 'kill', 'So', 'naturally', 'Michael', 'Porter', 'wing', 'team', 'So', 'much', 'eventually', 'place', 'live', 'mother', 'garage.The', 'season', 'various', 'people', 'coming', 'scene', 'need', 'help', 'same', 'time', 'Michael', 'group', 'continue', 'seek', 'out', 'truth', 'what', 'going', 'spy', 'world', 'who', 'burning', 'whom', 'how', 'together', 'keep', 'Porter', 'discovering', 'Michael', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'burned', 'end', 'who', 'perhaps', 'Michael', 'can', 'discover', 'who', 'was', 'burned', 'then', 'Porter', 'might', 'find', 'out', 'well.Each', 'story', 'client', 'subsequent', 'rescue', 'team', 'same', 'time', 'bits', 'pieces', 'main', 'puzzle', 'Michael', 'been', 'going', 'episode', 'one', 'amazing', 'thing', 'episode', 'telling', 'concurrent', 'stories', 'filled', 'action', 'adventure', 'actual', 'story', 'boot.The', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'said', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'entire', 'team', 'here', 'perfect', 'fit', 'one', 'were', 'disappear', 'would', 'be', 'felt', 'not', 'just', 'characters', 'viewers', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'gel', 'together', 'better', 'most', 'rare', 'most', 'TV', 'series', 'lately', 'more', 'thought', 'going', 'making', 'fantastic', 'ensemble', 'shows', 'past', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'show', 'entire', 'team', 'intact.The', 'new', 'season', 'series', 'begin', 'soon', 'Picking', 'up', 'four', 'previous', 'sets', 'can', 'only', 'help', 'not', 'just', 'increase', 'awareness', 'show', 'make', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'Then', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'rest', 'waiting', 'anticipation', 'week', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'new', 'case', 'will', 'assist', 'who', 'whole', 'burn', 'notice', 'discovering', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'great', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'often', 'talked', 'how', 'wonderful', 'get', 'entire', 'season', 'rather', 'waiting', 'cliffhanger', 'week', 'fact', 'TV', 'viewers', 'keep', 'show', 'air', 'important', 'thing', 'DVD', 'sets', 'can', 'miss', 'season', 'half', 'watch', 'DVD', 'catch', 'up', 'time', 'get', 'back', 'once', 'more', 'BURN', 'NOTICE', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'three', 'major', 'networks', 'show', 'cable', 'stations', 'are', 'becoming', 'place', 'go', 'when', 'looking', 'quality', 'programming', 'Give', 'series', 'shot', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked']",N/A

This is the season of tension and threat. Michael is getting back into the CIA bit by bit, then he gets framed for his handler Max getting shot. From that moment on he is out of control and desperately getting lost in the task of understanding why and getting some control back.Season 4 raised my blood pressure compared to the previous 3 seasons. It was very good but different and more tension filled in a manner that spanned episodes. It built the platform for even higher tensions in season 5.I already miss Burn Notice now that the series is over.

1353418,AZAC7B4HD5ZVC,B003L77GZQ,Steven Herring,"[0, 1]","Burn Notice season 4 does everything right. It is action packed, story driven, well acted, and has great depth of character. This season has n excellent overarching plot which adds a new character to the team. Jesse Porter is a spy well he was until Michael accidentally gets him burned. Without Jesse finding that out they join forces to take down the people that burned Michael. They are in fact the same people that got Jesse burned after all, even though Jesse doesn't know that.Jesse is a great addition to the show and his presence really helps to push Mike and Fi in their relationship as he sort of creates a love triangle. Brennan and Larry make a reappearance near the end of the season and that is always great for Burn Notice as these characters always push Michael to his limits. A new villain is also added in the form of Vaughn the now head of the secret organization behind Michael's burn notice. He pushes Michael to do things throughout the season like the aforementioned burning of Jesse. Their relationship changes throughout the season as at first you don't know if he is a bad guy or not, to when he becomes a liability to everyone.There are some great special features in the set like Roasts of both White Collar and Burn Notice, an audio commentary of the season finale (finally a new audio commentary), deleted scenes, and the pilot for White Collar, among others. The video picture of this set seems a little lower than season 3 but it still looks pretty good, and is the best we will get for a while until they decide that Blu Ray is the way to go.Burn Notice season 4 is the best in the series and interweaves the overarching plot seamlessly with the case of the week drama. Even those procedural cases seemed a bit fresher this year as they strayed from the familiar a lot with some stellar moments.

The question for Michael is if he truly wants it as it will change everything in subtle and not so subtle ways including his relationship with Fi (Gabrielle Anwar). Over the course of season four Michael is teamed up with his evil twin and mentor Larry (the marvelous Tim Matheson who also has directed a number of episodes--bit of trivia Tim Matheson also did the voice for the classic 60's cartoon for the title character in ""Jonny Quest"")and he also has to partner up with the ""enemy--Vaughn (the terrific Robert Wisdom seen previously on ""Supernatural"")the head of a private spy agency that burned Michael. In the process Michael burns by accident Jesse Porter (Coby Bell) another spy who is innocent and Michael feels the need to partner up with Jesse to help him to become legit again AND still solve his own problems.Fox continues to do an exceptional job with the transfers for ""Burn Notice"" with a nice looking transfer that captures the gritty look of the show (shot on Super 16mm film). Unfortunately, the reaction to the Blu-ray release of season two means that we still haven't gotten a high def release for this show (it looked gritty for a very good reason--it's SUPPOSED to look that way)so high def fans will either have to suffice with the high def broadcasts or with the DVD. Audio sounds terrific as well with a nice, active surround mix.The show is close captioned in English. We get the following special features: Deleted scenes ; Sam Axe's guide to ladies and libations a humorous featurette ; Burn Notice roasts white collar; White collar roasts Burn Notice; Best-laid plans: The stunts of Burn Notice; Gag reel. We also get audio commentary on the final episode ""Last Stand"".
