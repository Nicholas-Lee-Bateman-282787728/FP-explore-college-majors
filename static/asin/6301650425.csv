259997,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,6301650425,Best Of All,"[1, 2]","It is all in an astrological sign to make hardwood stars.This sports comedy features some great comics - Jonathan Winters & Flip Wilson - great musicians for the soundtrack - Doc Severinsen, The Four Tops, The Spinners & The Sylvers - and an all-star cast of pro basketball players, with Julius Erving in the leading role as Moses Guthrie, in a special spin of a lousy team becoming a championship contender.The Pittsburgh Pythons are so bad that ownership falls into the hands of young locker room attendant Tyrone Millman (James Bond III). With Guthrie as the only star - and not too popular with the other players - Millman has got to come up with a new plan, and fast.It just so happens that Millman has a hobby in astrology and he hires astrologer Mona Mondieu (Stockard Channing) to assist in turning the franchise around. Mondieu says that all players must be born under the same astrological sign - Pisces - which conveniently is the same sign as Guthrie's, and that is where the impossible dream of the newly-named Pittsburgh Pisces going from worst to first sets sail.Chick Hearn and Marv Albert do great jobs announcing the action, with Meadowlark Lemon (the Rev. Grady Jackson) nearly stealing the show with his wit. Jerry Tarkanian, Lou Hudson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Spencer Haywood and Bob Lanier provide the star power on the court and the Pisces' home floor is something to see.The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh provides enough laughs and continued interest from fans to warrant Sony Pictures to finally release it on DVD.",4,It Is All In The Stars,1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,1534,"['astrological', 'sign', 'make', 'hardwood', 'stars.This', 'sports', 'comedy', 'great', 'comics', 'Jonathan', 'Winters', 'Flip', 'Wilson', 'great', 'musicians', 'soundtrack', 'Doc', 'Severinsen', 'Four', 'Tops', 'Spinners', 'Sylvers', 'all-star', 'cast', 'pro', 'basketball', 'players', 'Julius', 'Erving', 'leading', 'role', 'Moses', 'Guthrie', 'special', 'spin', 'lousy', 'team', 'becoming', 'championship', 'contender.The', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pythons', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'ownership', 'hands', 'young', 'locker', 'room', 'attendant', 'Tyrone', 'Millman', 'James', 'Bond', 'III', 'Guthrie', 'only', 'star', 'not', 'too', 'popular', 'other', 'players', 'Millman', 'got', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'plan', 'fast.It', 'just', 'so', 'Millman', 'hobby', 'astrology', 'astrologer', 'Mona', 'Mondieu', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'assist', 'turning', 'franchise', 'around', 'Mondieu', 'players', 'must', 'be', 'born', 'same', 'astrological', 'sign', 'Pisces', 'conveniently', 'same', 'sign', 'Guthrie', 'where', 'impossible', 'dream', 'newly-named', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pisces', 'going', 'worst', 'first', 'sets', 'sail.Chick', 'Hearn', 'Marv', 'Albert', 'do', 'great', 'jobs', 'announcing', 'action', 'Meadowlark', 'Lemon', 'Rev', 'Grady', 'Jackson', 'nearly', 'stealing', 'show', 'wit', 'Jerry', 'Tarkanian', 'Lou', 'Hudson', 'Kareem', 'Abdul-Jabbar', 'Spencer', 'Haywood', 'Bob', 'Lanier', 'provide', 'star', 'power', 'court', 'Pisces', 'home', 'floor', 'something', 'see.The', 'Fish', 'That', 'Saved', 'Pittsburgh', 'enough', 'laughs', 'continued', 'interest', 'fans', 'warrant', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'finally', 'release', 'DVD']",The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh VHS

259999,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6301650425,David Baldwin,"[7, 7]","My interest in this film was piqued for a couple of reasons.  In a recent book called ""The 100 Greatest Sports Movies"" this one came in at....Number 100.  I was on the bus not too long ago and I was within earshot of an African-American gentleman who was discussing with his friend his favorite movies and ""The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh"" was mentioned.  This isn't the greatest movie in the world nor the funniest.  The direction by Gilbert Moses is a little shaggy and the acting in some cases, most notably by the aforementioned Julius Erving, is near non-existent.  The film gets by, however, on high spirits and it's buoyancy is infectuous.  I was 16 when this film came out in 1979 so there's a little bit of nostalgia going on here.  Can't say enough about the polyester, strobe lights, mile-high fros, and uber-micro basketball shorts.  This film holds up for me because I was of that time.  Maybe the modern basketball fan might appreciate it for the montage of jump shots that Erving makes.",4,"Don't Give Up Your Day Job, Dr. J.",1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,1000,"['interest', 'film', 'was', 'piqued', 'couple', 'reasons', 'recent', 'book', 'called', '100', 'Greatest', 'Sports', 'Movies', 'one', 'came', '.Number', '100', 'was', 'bus', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'was', 'earshot', 'African-American', 'gentleman', 'who', 'was', 'discussing', 'friend', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Fish', 'Saved', 'Pittsburgh', 'was', 'mentioned', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'movie', 'world', 'funniest', 'direction', 'Gilbert', 'Moses', 'little', 'shaggy', 'acting', 'cases', 'most', 'notably', 'aforementioned', 'Julius', 'Erving', 'non-existent', 'film', 'however', 'high', 'spirits', 'buoyancy', 'infectuous', 'was', '16', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', '1979', 'little', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'going', 'here', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'polyester', 'strobe', 'lights', 'mile-high', 'fros', 'uber-micro', 'basketball', 'shorts', 'film', 'up', 'was', 'time', 'Maybe', 'modern', 'basketball', 'fan', 'might', 'appreciate', 'montage', 'jump', 'shots', 'Erving']",The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh VHS
