A group of thugs w/ guns? Well, it looks like Owen's little problem just became a valuable asset, and man, is he ever up to the challenge! I love this kid!

While the general premise offers nothing new in the way of crime thrillers, director Steven C. Miller only uses this as a platform for the unrelenting action that is to follow.

There is.

The associate and his new wife, each have a child from a previous marriage, and are looking to start a new life in a new town. They don't tell the kids about the money.""We don't have to do this clean, you go down this list and kill them all, then you find my money. You got 48 hours,"" the mob boss says. He sends out four hitmen to get his cash back and kill anyone and everyone in the way.But the hitmen, after killing the parents, at the Rutledge home aren't counting on having to deal with the emotionally unstable son Owen (Ryan Hartwig). He helps his new sister out of the house and sets up a variety of lethal booby-traps for anyone who comes after them.Suddenly there are only two bad guys and they've found paperwork on the kid. Apparently, Owen's off the chart on his aggression scale. They begin to have second thoughts about going after the kids, but know they can't go back to the mob boss empty handed.

1529986,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007CZ334Q,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 6]","I'm going to try to NOT oversell the gritty indie ""The Aggression Scale.""  This is a small, low-budget endeavor that succeeds on its own modest terms.  But it is really best to keep your expectations in check, that way you might be pleasantly surprised.  A hit at this year's SXSW Film Festival, ""The Aggression Scale"" tells a fairly simple story, allows for a slow build tension, and then packs a few terrifically unpleasant confrontations into its final act.  But the less you know, the better.  The movie is already being compared to another prominent and beloved film (both by the media and with other reviewers here).  I'm not mentioning which movie, though.  I happen to think that making this comparison devalues the twists that develop in the film's second half.  I had been aware of this prior to seeing the film and as I watched the movie, I wished I hadn't known where exactly we were headed.  In fact, I screened this with a friend and kept all secrets to myself.  When things started happening, it had much more impact for him because he wasn't expecting anything in particular.Truthfully, there's not much plot to director Steven C. Miller's third film.  But guess what?  It doesn't really matter.  It's best not to scrutinize the film from an intellectual level, just hang on for the experience.  I was no fan of his last movie, The Scream of the Banshee, which took a good idea and turned it into a most generic thriller.  For me, ""The Aggression Scale"" definitely is a step in the right direction, but it's still quite rough around the edges.  In this case, though, that works well for the movie which has a seventies exploitation type ambience.  It's a gritty Grindhouse type of movie with loads of violence, a fascinating hero, menacing bad guys, and an occasional lapse of logic.  But it works.  ""Twin Peaks"" veterans Ray Wise and Dana Ashbrook join forces as the primary villains in the piece.  Wise, a crime boss just out of jail, enlists his henchman (led by Ashbrook) to recover some stolen money.  This leads to general murder and mayhem.You want more story?  Too bad.  Nothing is particularly explained beyond this cursory outline.  The bad guys soon go after a family at their desolate country home.  And the rest of the story plays out as a cat-and-mouse game of survival.  As I said, there are some nice surprises and much brutality.  It's always good to see Wise although he doesn't have much to do here.  The break-out performance is young Ryan Hartwig, who conveys a lot without saying anything.  I liked ""The Aggression Scale"" for exactly what it is.  It's not a great movie by any means, but it is an effective one on a visceral level.  With moderate expectation, there's plenty to enjoy here as a guilty pleasure.  About 3 1/2 stars, I'll round up for Hartwig.

1529990,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007CZ334Q,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","As with the title here, some have called THE AGRESSION SCALE a version of HOME ALONE with the results of the traps seen on screen. That's an apt description. Does it make a good movie? When it comes to originality yes, but in follow through it heads to the mediocre level.Ray Wise plays a mobster just released from jail. Before he heads out of the country and can stand trial he gives his top man Dana Ashbrook an order: find the person who took $500,000 of his money and kill him and his entire family and do it in 48 hours. With few leads to follow Ashbrook and his team go down the list of names they've been given, each leading them closer to the suspect. Not wanting to leave witnesses, they also kill each person they come into contact with.So where is this suspect? He's just remarried a woman who brings along with her late teens daughter, a girl who wants nothing to do with this family or with her new step brother. That stepbrother has a bit of a problem and was recently released from a mental hospital. It seems that he has a tendency towards extreme violence, something measured by what they call the aggression scale. His scores far exceed anything seen before but medication seems to be helping.The bad guys follow their leads until they arrive at the just purchased home of the newly married couple. A combination of torture (not lengthy) and murder leave only the kids left to deal with. But as this team begins to search the house for them, the young boy turns the tables on them, leaving traps and wounding them as he helps his new sister escape.The team tracks the kids down not just through the house but in the surrounding woods as well. Along the way they have serious wounds inflicted upon them by the resourceful kid, some going so far as to be killed in self defense. He may just be a pre-teen but these goons have no idea who they're up against.The idea of having a troubled teen taking on tough guy gangsters sounds like an interesting one. The traps he makes for them are well thought out and vicious at times. When you add the touch of the aggression scale psychological make up to the mix it makes it even more interesting.What stops the movie from being great though is the acting. It's not terrible but it's not quite that good either. Worst of all is the step sister who's screaming while attempting to hide from the bad guys makes her one of the stupidest victims of all time. Hint: when you're being chased, never scream to give away your location.One interesting note among the cast is the coupling of Wise and Ashbrook. Both were part of the now famous series TWIN PEAKS. It's nice to see them reunited here.As I said, the movie isn't that bad and actually has some decent moments in it. You can tell that this one is a low budget flick but in the end it seems better than several big budget films I've seen in the past few years. It may not be for everyone's taste, but if you're looking for something a little different and don't have a problem with low budget style and acting, then give this one a watch.",3,HOME ALONE WITH BLOOD,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,3048,"['title', 'here', 'have', 'called', 'AGRESSION', 'SCALE', 'version', 'HOME', 'ALONE', 'results', 'traps', 'seen', 'screen', 'apt', 'description', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'When', 'originality', 'yes', 'follow', 'mediocre', 'level.Ray', 'Wise', 'mobster', 'just', 'released', 'jail', 'country', 'can', 'stand', 'trial', 'top', 'man', 'Dana', 'Ashbrook', 'order', 'find', 'person', 'who', 'took', '500,000', 'money', 'kill', 'entire', 'family', 'do', '48', 'hours', 'few', 'leads', 'follow', 'Ashbrook', 'team', 'go', 'down', 'list', 'names', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'leading', 'closer', 'suspect', 'Not', 'wanting', 'leave', 'witnesses', 'also', 'kill', 'person', 'come', 'contact', 'with.So', 'where', 'suspect', 'just', 'remarried', 'woman', 'who', 'along', 'late', 'teens', 'daughter', 'girl', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'family', 'new', 'step', 'brother', 'stepbrother', 'bit', 'problem', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'mental', 'hospital', 'tendency', 'extreme', 'violence', 'something', 'measured', 'what', 'call', 'aggression', 'scale', 'scores', 'far', 'exceed', 'anything', 'seen', 'medication', 'be', 'helping.The', 'bad', 'guys', 'follow', 'leads', 'arrive', 'just', 'purchased', 'home', 'newly', 'married', 'couple', 'combination', 'torture', 'not', 'lengthy', 'murder', 'leave', 'only', 'kids', 'left', 'deal', 'team', 'search', 'house', 'young', 'boy', 'tables', 'leaving', 'traps', 'wounding', 'new', 'sister', 'escape.The', 'team', 'kids', 'down', 'not', 'just', 'house', 'surrounding', 'woods', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'have', 'serious', 'wounds', 'inflicted', 'resourceful', 'kid', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'be', 'killed', 'self', 'defense', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'pre-teen', 'goons', 'have', 'idea', 'who', ""'re"", 'up', 'against.The', 'idea', 'having', 'troubled', 'teen', 'taking', 'tough', 'guy', 'gangsters', 'interesting', 'one', 'traps', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'vicious', 'times', 'When', 'add', 'touch', 'aggression', 'scale', 'psychological', 'make', 'up', 'mix', 'even', 'more', 'interesting.What', 'movie', 'being', 'great', 'though', 'acting', 'not', 'terrible', 'not', 'quite', 'good', 'Worst', 'step', 'sister', 'who', 'screaming', 'attempting', 'hide', 'bad', 'guys', 'one', 'stupidest', 'victims', 'time', 'Hint', 'when', ""'re"", 'being', 'chased', 'never', 'scream', 'give', 'away', 'location.One', 'interesting', 'note', 'cast', 'coupling', 'Wise', 'Ashbrook', 'were', 'part', 'now', 'famous', 'series', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'nice', 'see', 'reunited', 'here.As', 'said', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'actually', 'decent', 'moments', 'can', 'tell', 'one', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'end', 'better', 'several', 'big', 'budget', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'low', 'budget', 'style', 'acting', 'then', 'give', 'one', 'watch']",N/A

Miller`s The Aggression Scale.  The home-invasion thriller isn't owned by Chris Columbus' 1990 family comedy, but when you make a blond pre-teen kid the defender of the home, the comparison is inevitable.  While a darker Home Alone with R-rated violence may seem like a promising prospect, The Aggression Scale seems stuck at ""insane hard as nails  kid dishes out bloody vengeance.""  Although Miller opens his movie with a bravura opening sequence and manages to hold on to some semblance of tension, the thrills die down by giving Superboy all the power.An unstoppable anti-hero taking down unambiguously bad guys in an R-rated setting is almost always done to indulge bloodlust.  We feel no remorse for those who have slaughtered the innocent, and we certainly don't feel it when the protagonist's actions are done in self-defense.  Miller does an excellent job of setting up  hitman Lloyd as a sadist who enjoys killing anytime, anyplace, anywhere, and who clearly deserves whatever violence will be visited upon him.  The intro sucks in the audience by opening with the definition of the ""Aggression Scale"" (a test to measure one's proclivity towards violence), the low hum of the soundtrack, Lloyd's toothy and psychotic smile, Ray Wise bringing the patented Ray Wise-menace, and then cutting to loud, angry, energetic opening titles.  We then move to meeting the family, and our curiosity is piqued by the silent, clearly disturbed Owen.  The elements are in place for an exciting collision course.But the collision turns out to be more of a fender-bender.  The movie takes a little too long setting up the family dynamic, in particular Lauren's character.  Miller wants to keep Owen mysterious, and since Lauren will be his emotional anchor, we need to spend time with her and her emotional baggage.  However, her problems seem far too normal in a movie with a hit squad versus My Little Punisher.  The impact is further diminished when we see the attackers bust in, but then cut to Owen wearing all-black clothes, and double-lacing up his combat boots.  We know where the power lies, and it's not with the contract killers.  With so few characters and a clear indication of who's going to be taking the hurt, there's not much drama.  The audience simply waits to see how Owen will take out the people trying to kill him and his family.It's never dull, but the characters are all one dimensional, and when it's over, there is an overwhelming feeling of so what?",2,Tarantino meets Home Alone,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,2580,"['Tarantino', 'did', 'R-rated', 'spoof', 'Home', 'Alone', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'bear', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'Steven', 'C.', 'Miller', 's', 'Aggression', 'Scale', 'home-invasion', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'owned', 'Chris', 'Columbus', '1990', 'family', 'comedy', 'when', 'make', 'blond', 'pre-teen', 'kid', 'defender', 'home', 'comparison', 'inevitable', 'darker', 'Home', 'Alone', 'R-rated', 'violence', 'may', 'seem', 'promising', 'prospect', 'Aggression', 'Scale', 'stuck', 'insane', 'hard', 'nails', 'kid', 'out', 'bloody', 'vengeance', 'Miller', 'movie', 'bravura', 'opening', 'sequence', 'manages', 'hold', 'semblance', 'tension', 'thrills', 'die', 'down', 'giving', 'Superboy', 'power.An', 'unstoppable', 'anti-hero', 'taking', 'down', 'unambiguously', 'bad', 'guys', 'R-rated', 'setting', 'almost', 'always', 'done', 'indulge', 'bloodlust', 'feel', 'remorse', 'who', 'have', 'slaughtered', 'innocent', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'when', 'protagonist', 'actions', 'are', 'done', 'self-defense', 'Miller', 'excellent', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'hitman', 'Lloyd', 'sadist', 'who', 'killing', 'anytime', 'anyplace', 'anywhere', 'who', 'clearly', 'violence', 'will', 'be', 'visited', 'intro', 'audience', 'opening', 'definition', 'Aggression', 'Scale', 'test', 'measure', 'one', 'proclivity', 'towards', 'violence', 'low', 'hum', 'soundtrack', 'Lloyd', 'toothy', 'psychotic', 'smile', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'bringing', 'patented', 'Ray', 'Wise-menace', 'then', 'cutting', 'loud', 'angry', 'energetic', 'opening', 'titles', 'then', 'move', 'meeting', 'family', 'curiosity', 'piqued', 'silent', 'clearly', 'disturbed', 'Owen', 'elements', 'are', 'place', 'exciting', 'collision', 'course.But', 'collision', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'fender-bender', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'setting', 'up', 'family', 'dynamic', 'particular', 'Lauren', 'character', 'Miller', 'keep', 'Owen', 'mysterious', 'Lauren', 'will', 'be', 'emotional', 'anchor', 'need', 'spend', 'time', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'However', 'problems', 'seem', 'far', 'too', 'normal', 'movie', 'hit', 'squad', 'My', 'Little', 'Punisher', 'impact', 'further', 'diminished', 'when', 'see', 'attackers', 'bust', 'then', 'cut', 'Owen', 'wearing', 'all-black', 'clothes', 'double-lacing', 'up', 'combat', 'boots', 'know', 'where', 'power', 'not', 'contract', 'killers', 'so', 'few', 'characters', 'clear', 'indication', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'taking', 'hurt', 'not', 'much', 'drama', 'audience', 'simply', 'see', 'how', 'Owen', 'will', 'take', 'out', 'people', 'trying', 'kill', 'family.It', 'never', 'dull', 'characters', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional', 'when', 'over', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'what']",N/A

The Aggression Scale represents the worst Hollywood has to offer and it's mind boggling that a company would even agree to make something as bad as this.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,1366,"['really', 'hate', 'when', 'make', 'movies', 'one', 'absolutely', 'point', 'whole', 'thing', 'wanted', 'see', 'bunch', 'people', 'running', 'around', 'shooting', 'other', 'hardly', 'saying', 'word', ""'d"", 'watch', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'Aggression', 'Scale', 'pointless', 'film', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'team', 'close', 'unfinished', 'business', 'Mr.', 'Bellavance', 'Ray', 'Wise', ""n't"", 'want', 'witnesses', 'team', 'killing', 'spree', 'Everything', 'going', 'planned', 'find', 'family', 'children', 'decide', 'fight', 'back', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'darker', 'version', 'Home', 'Alone', 'even', 'something', 'similar', 'Die', 'Hard', 'kids', 'was', ""n't"", 'lead', 'character', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Hartwig', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'entire', 'film', 'cute', 'catch', 'phrase', 'nothing', 'special', 'end', 'not', 'single', 'word', 'even', 'was', 'preferable', 'performance', 'Fabianne', 'Therese', 'whole', 'movie', 'girl', 'whining', 'crying', 'making', 'weird', 'noises', 'really', 'was', 'enough', 'drive', 'person', 'insane', 'said', 'earlier', 'really', 'point', 'film', 'reason', 'watch', 'either', 'story', 'thin', 'film', 'basically', 'hour', 'half', 'people', 'running', 'around', 'shooting', 'other', 'Aggression', 'Scale', 'worst', 'Hollywood', 'offer', 'mind', 'boggling', 'company', 'would', 'even', 'agree', 'make', 'something', 'as', 'bad']",N/A

It is all about a mobster one Mr Bellavance, who is out on bail. He has decided to do a runner with half a million dollars that was the result of one of his deals, and take his son with him. The only problem is that someone has only gone and nicked it. So as all good mobsters do he decides to do some mediaeval retribution. He sends his hit men off to find the culprit, get the money back and kill anyone who might have simply been near it. Forgive and forget are not his motto.The motley crew of hit men are led by Dana Ashbrook (the eagle eyed of you may remember him from `Twin Peaks') and he puts in a fine performance as the cold hearted and ruthless killer. Once he has `topped' somebody he has to take Polaroid's of them for the lovely Mr Bellavance's amusement.Then we have the nice lawyer Bill, who has just got married to Maggie. He has a son who needs special medication and she has a teenage daughter who is into self harm, so this most certainly isn't The Brady Bunch. Anyway Lloyd and co come a calling and decide to exact some arbitrary slaughter. Only thing is that little Owen (Ryan Hartwig) has forgotten to take a pill or three and we soon find out that he has a bit of a temper and that coupled with an obsession for all things survivalist makes him a lot more lethal than Macaulay Culkin could ever dream of.This is just brilliant fun, director Steven C. Miller has just got the best out of a little known cast and they all really deliver, Ryan Hartwig is great as the dangerous, and mute Owen but Fabianne Therese as Lauren is superb as the teenage sister and goes through the whole gamut of emotions during the course of the film which just shows how versatile she is.  There are some plot contrivances but I just didn't care this had me hooked almost from the start and just bounded along as all good action films should be. So for some almost mindless fun that recasts the Home Alone genre as a sort of blood bath, this is the one for you, I absolutely loved it but lost a star because of the aforementioned contrivances, but on a good day this is definitely a five star watch - recommended.",4,Home Alone meets Rambo!,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,2206,"['stonking', 'little', 'film', 'really', 'took', 'surprise', 'rather', 'good', 'way', 'mobster', 'one', 'Mr', 'Bellavance', 'who', 'out', 'bail', 'decided', 'do', 'runner', 'million', 'dollars', 'was', 'result', 'one', 'deals', 'take', 'son', 'only', 'problem', 'someone', 'only', 'gone', 'nicked', 'So', 'good', 'mobsters', 'do', 'do', 'mediaeval', 'retribution', 'hit', 'men', 'find', 'culprit', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'simply', 'been', 'Forgive', 'forget', 'are', 'not', 'motto.The', 'motley', 'crew', 'hit', 'men', 'are', 'led', 'Dana', 'Ashbrook', 'eagle', 'eyed', 'may', 'remember', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'fine', 'performance', 'cold', 'hearted', 'ruthless', 'killer', 'Once', 'topped', 'somebody', 'take', 'Polaroid', 'lovely', 'Mr', 'Bellavance', 'amusement.Then', 'have', 'nice', 'lawyer', 'Bill', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'married', 'Maggie', 'son', 'who', 'special', 'medication', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'self', 'harm', 'so', 'most', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Anyway', 'Lloyd', 'co', 'come', 'calling', 'decide', 'exact', 'arbitrary', 'slaughter', 'Only', 'thing', 'little', 'Owen', 'Ryan', 'Hartwig', 'forgotten', 'take', 'pill', 'three', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'bit', 'temper', 'coupled', 'obsession', 'things', 'survivalist', 'lot', 'more', 'lethal', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'could', 'ever', 'dream', 'of.This', 'just', 'brilliant', 'fun', 'director', 'Steven', 'C.', 'Miller', 'just', 'got', 'best', 'little', 'known', 'cast', 'really', 'deliver', 'Ryan', 'Hartwig', 'great', 'dangerous', 'mute', 'Owen', 'Fabianne', 'Therese', 'Lauren', 'superb', 'teenage', 'sister', 'whole', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'course', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'versatile', 'are', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'had', 'hooked', 'almost', 'start', 'just', 'bounded', 'along', 'good', 'action', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'So', 'almost', 'mindless', 'fun', 'Home', 'Alone', 'genre', 'sort', 'blood', 'bath', 'one', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'lost', 'star', 'aforementioned', 'contrivances', 'good', 'day', 'definitely', 'five', 'star', 'watch', 'recommended']",N/A

When a recently released criminal gets out of prison and returns to his life he notices that $500,000 of his money has been stolen. After finding out who took it he hires a group of hit men to get the money back. Things go fine until they reach a house with a boy who fights back. Based on the preview I was intrigued at this. It seemed like a movie I would like but thought it could go either way. I have to say this was a huge surprise to me. This is not a movie for everyone because it is very bloody and violent. The best (and only) way to describe this is that this is an over the top extreme violent version of ""Home Alone"". If that doesn't want to make you watch it then I don't know what else to say. To me this movie was very fun to watch and I really liked it, it a morbid way. These revenge movies like this are one of my favorite type of movies. Overall, a very over-the-top violent version of ""Home Alone"" that I loved but is not for everyone.
