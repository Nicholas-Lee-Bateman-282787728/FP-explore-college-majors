We used to watch it and just giggle and be amazed all at the same time.  FZ was simply a brilliant composer and a grand band leader.You can watch FZ play, conduct and simply sizzle through some of the really great songs from his career on this DVD.  Songs like ZOOT ALLURES and TINSLETOWN REBELLION are done so well, and I must mention that the Allmand Brothers song WHIPPING POST is really done great by the band.Needless to say, due to this being a DVD produced by EMI and not by the ZFT, it is most likley edited to someones taste within the INDUSTRY.. which never suited FZ anyway when he was alive... so why do him justice in his death???!!!Great sound on the DVD.  The sound was done correctly, so that much FZ can take delight in.A couple of bad notes.  There is a different lineup of songs on the CD version of this, and one of the songs that I would have liked included was LETS MOVE TO CLEVELAND as well as C@SUCK3RS B@LL.  Also, the packaging is well, non existant.  For a great release, there is nothing in the DVD case but the DVD.  When you see how Gail Zappa and the ZFT has done the past two DVD's by FZ (Halloween and Baby Snakes -[...]) you will not like the EMI no frills bare bones approach to this DVD.  EMI should be ashamed releasing this to FZ fans in such a disrespectful way.. FZ fans are used to having a lot of things to look at and read with each release-  I know, I have all of his releases.However, buy it, and watch it and hope that Gail can get it and put it out without anything missing.",5,A Fantastic Journey of Guitar Based Humor Rock,1074816000,"01 23, 2004",2004,1592,"['used', 'have', 'roommate', 'college', 'had', 'VCR', 'format', 'used', 'watch', 'just', 'giggle', 'be', 'amazed', 'same', 'time', 'FZ', 'was', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'composer', 'grand', 'band', 'leader.You', 'can', 'watch', 'FZ', 'play', 'conduct', 'simply', 'sizzle', 'really', 'great', 'songs', 'career', 'DVD', 'Songs', 'ZOOT', 'ALLURES', 'TINSLETOWN', 'REBELLION', 'are', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'must', 'mention', 'Allmand', 'Brothers', 'song', 'WHIPPING', 'POST', 'really', 'done', 'great', 'band.Needless', 'say', 'due', 'being', 'DVD', 'produced', 'EMI', 'not', 'ZFT', 'most', 'likley', 'edited', 'someones', 'taste', 'INDUSTRY..', 'never', 'suited', 'FZ', 'anyway', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'so', 'why', 'do', 'justice', 'death', 'Great', 'sound', 'DVD', 'sound', 'was', 'done', 'correctly', 'that', 'much', 'FZ', 'can', 'take', 'delight', 'in.A', 'couple', 'bad', 'notes', 'different', 'lineup', 'songs', 'CD', 'version', 'one', 'songs', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'included', 'was', 'LETS', 'MOVE', 'TO', 'CLEVELAND', 'as', 'well', 'C', '@', 'SUCK3RS', 'B', '@', 'LL', 'Also', 'packaging', 'well', 'non', 'existant', 'great', 'release', 'nothing', 'DVD', 'case', 'DVD', 'When', 'see', 'how', 'Gail', 'Zappa', 'ZFT', 'done', 'past', 'two', 'DVD', 'FZ', 'Halloween', 'Baby', 'Snakes', '[', ']', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'EMI', 'frills', 'bare', 'bones', 'approach', 'DVD', 'EMI', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'releasing', 'FZ', 'fans', 'such', 'disrespectful', 'way..', 'FZ', 'fans', 'are', 'used', 'having', 'lot', 'things', 'look', 'read', 'release-', 'know', 'have', 'releases.However', 'buy', 'watch', 'hope', 'Gail', 'can', 'get', 'put', 'out', 'anything', 'missing']",N/A

And they stand on stage for maybe 90 minutes doing all of the most foolish songs that Zappa wrote in his ""dumbed down"" period, where pandering to teenage potty humor and getting a hit record seemed to be his primary concerns.The set opens with Zoot Allures, allowing one long Zappa guitar solo. After that, none of the fine musicians really has a chance to play much more than filler licks, with the possible exception of bass player Scott Thunes (who is well represented) and Chad Wackerman (who sits above the band with an air of calm detachment, so relaxed he makes his playing look effortless). Bobby Martin does a great vocal on the closing number, Whipping Post, but otherwise, it's silly songs all the way, and although the band delivers the goods with impeccable precision, no one looks as if he's having a whole lot of fun. The clowning is unspontaneous at best.As for the video footage itself, it's well shot, impeccably edited, but with far too many closeups of Frank Zappa's face, and a strange absence of longshots of the stage (the audience-eye view is missing).How unfortunate the no video seems to exist of the final Zappa tour, when they were tackling the most ambitious, complex, and beautiful compositions, with truly amazing jazz soloists and less of a focus on Zappa and his tendency toward self indulgence.This DVD will satisfy anyone who wanted to know what a Zappa concert looked like, but the material is among the most trivial he wrote.

780912,A2SIXKZZ1MOQDG,B0000E2W05,James J. Rossignol,"[3, 3]",It is usually a treat to view Frank Zappa in his prime.  His premature demise has left a hole in modern music.  He was a humorist and a serious composer at the same time.  The live music is still fresh and engaging even though it is twenty years old.  The only disappointment is that there wasn't more of the concert to view.  It is highly edited and interspersed with interview segments that highlight his views on life in general and humor in particular.  The void that remains behind after his death will never be filled appropriately.  The world lost a visionary when it lost Zappa who even in death remained cynical as he was buried in an unmarked grave in Golden Gate Park.  Who will tweak the uptight and bloated souls of society now that he is gone?  At least we can see this video and remember clearly how perceptive and biting his humor was.  There will never be another one like him.  Does humor belong in music?

Unlike Baby Snakes, Virgin Records put this out and I wonder if the Zappa family even approved it.

You have some songs and some interviews edited in to fill out the hour long release.

Most of the band had worked with Frank for several years, which led to a more relaxed, free-form attitude on stage.  This led to a lot of &quot;secret word&quot; shenanigans, with band members frequently changing the lyrics to (somewhat tired) songs to make the other band members laugh.  For an excellent example of what I'm talking about, see the first disc of &quot;You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol. 3&quot;.Unfortunately, that humor is in short supply on this disc.  The titular humor is only evident in the songs themselves which are, admittedly, juvenile, and widely available. The attraction of a Zappa live set is the element of surprise, of the spontaneous, not just run-throughs of songs you've already heard.The master tapes of this must exist somewhere, and I was hoping for extra footage (two nights were actually filmed). A lot of material was left out of the final movie (we get the last few seconds of &quot;The Deathless Horsie&quot;, but we get all of &quot;The Dangerous Kitchen&quot;.  Frank, why?).  However, since this was released by Virgin/EMI and not by The Zappa Family Trust, the likelihood of those performances ever making it to DVD are very slim.The sound and video on the disc are solid.For the price, it's worth seeing the 84 band in action.
