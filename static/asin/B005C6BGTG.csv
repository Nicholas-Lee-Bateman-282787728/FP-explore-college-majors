Soul Catcher starts out in the Mojave desert where they get into a 1939 German spy plane and fly across the desert to land in the lake beds to look for the medicine wheel, which they do find. The film deals with the haunting of the earth and they pulled EVP's from the ground in several locations. They stopped in El Reno, Oklahoma and filmed the Indian boarding schools that are haunted by the spirits of Indian children and elementals outside, animalistic, the one's with green eyes and growling, shadows 20 feet high, skinwalkers, shapeshifters and the legend of deer women. The Native American interviews will describe the real tragedies which encompass the school house haunting as well as the legends that the Indians believe and the ones that are made up to protect their tribes from other tribes and cowboys. Interesting EVP's from the schools will be played and those EVPs are not in English. The Booth's have tagged this film as their biggest, epic, Supernatural Adventure to date. Other Booth Brothers films include, The Haunted Boy, Death Tunnel, DarkPlace, The Possessed, Spooked, The Ghosts of Waverly Hills Sanatorium, Children of the Grave as seen on SyFy and Sony Pictures.The Haunted Boy, The Secret Diary Of The ExorcistChildren of the GraveThe PossessedSpooked The Ghosts Of Waverly Hills Sanatorium",5,Paranormal Supernatural Adventure,1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,1510,"['Fans', 'Booth', 'brother', 'are', 'treat', 'luckily', 'pour', 'passion', 'paranormal', 'genre', 'Soul', 'Catcher', 'latest', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'wild', 'spiritual', 'ride', 'Soul', 'Catcher', 'out', 'Mojave', 'desert', 'where', 'get', '1939', 'German', 'spy', 'plane', 'fly', 'desert', 'land', 'lake', 'beds', 'look', 'medicine', 'wheel', 'do', 'find', 'film', 'deals', 'haunting', 'earth', 'pulled', 'EVP', 'ground', 'several', 'locations', 'stopped', 'El', 'Reno', 'Oklahoma', 'filmed', 'Indian', 'boarding', 'schools', 'are', 'haunted', 'spirits', 'Indian', 'children', 'elementals', 'outside', 'animalistic', 'one', 'green', 'eyes', 'growling', '20', 'feet', 'high', 'skinwalkers', 'shapeshifters', 'legend', 'deer', 'women', 'Native', 'American', 'interviews', 'will', 'describe', 'real', 'tragedies', 'encompass', 'school', 'house', 'haunting', 'as', 'well', 'legends', 'Indians', 'believe', 'ones', 'are', 'made', 'up', 'protect', 'tribes', 'other', 'tribes', 'cowboys', 'Interesting', 'EVP', 'schools', 'will', 'be', 'played', 'EVPs', 'are', 'not', 'English', 'Booth', 'have', 'tagged', 'film', 'biggest', 'epic', 'Supernatural', 'Adventure', 'date', 'Other', 'Booth', 'Brothers', 'films', 'include', 'Haunted', 'Boy', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'DarkPlace', 'Possessed', 'Spooked', 'Ghosts', 'Waverly', 'Hills', 'Sanatorium', 'Children', 'Grave', 'seen', 'SyFy', 'Sony', 'Pictures.The', 'Haunted', 'Boy', 'Secret', 'Diary', 'ExorcistChildren', 'GraveThe', 'PossessedSpooked', 'Ghosts', 'Waverly', 'Hills', 'Sanatorium']",Soul Catcher

Most Native children were kidnapped by the US government, forced into boarding schools where their culture was literally beaten out of them to try to make them culturally white. If you don't believe me, google Kill the Indian, Save the Man.Many Native children died at these schools from disease and abuse, and many Natives think their spirits are not at rest. in Canada the courts labeled what happened in their schools outright genocide. So what do the Booth brothers do?They add lots of &#34;spooky&#34; music and throw it all together with bad editing and no storyline. You can't tell what the hell is going on most of the time. A first semester film student, IN HIGH SCHOOL, would do a better job. You or I could probably do better filming with our cell phones.I really doubt the Booths told these Native interviewees what kind of a film they planned to make. They likely expected a serious documentary exposing real abuse. I'm sure they're sickened over this travesty of a film, and so am I.The Booths should be ashamed, but I doubt they are.
