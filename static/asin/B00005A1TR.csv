The few available episodes are the far end of the  British humor that some people love and others hate.  I really liked this series and wished they had more.  The characters are colorful.  It;s based on a priest stuck on a loser island with a young dimwit trainee and a retired perv priest with a bad attitude.,4,If you like British humor this is for you,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,366,"['was', 'short', 'series', 'ended', 'when', 'star', 'died', 'few', 'available', 'episodes', 'are', 'far', 'end', 'British', 'humor', 'people', 'love', 'others', 'hate', 'really', 'liked', 'series', 'wished', 'had', 'more', 'characters', 'are', 'colorful', 'based', 'priest', 'stuck', 'loser', 'island', 'young', 'dimwit', 'trainee', 'retired', 'perv', 'priest', 'bad', 'attitude']",Father Ted - Heaven and Hell Vol. 1  VHS
