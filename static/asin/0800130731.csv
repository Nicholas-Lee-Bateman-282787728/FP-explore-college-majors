I was hoping to get the second ending to this movie.  I had read that they did two endings.  One where he catches the train and they end together which is what you want, or I did!  Disappointed with this ending that leaves you hanging.",4,Tugs,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,337,"['plot', 'movie', 'Good', 'being', 'one', 'sophia', 'Loren', 'first', 'movies', 'Holden', 'always', 'good', 'was', 'hoping', 'get', 'second', 'ending', 'movie', 'had', 'read', 'did', 'two', 'endings', 'One', 'where', 'train', 'end', 'together', 'what', 'want', 'did', 'Disappointed', 'ending', 'hanging']",N/A
163072,A1MO0ZLZR1V3NN,0800130731,David Wilmot,"[12, 15]","I saw the film with the original downbeat ending in Davenport, Iowa in 1958. It must have been a test-market showing, since Carol Reed's biography suggests that version was never distributed in the States. As I recall, the Holden character arrives at the locked station gates after the train has departed and tells his driver, ""I'll find her! I'll find her the next time I get up to London."" ""Sure you will,"" the driver replies.From the beginning the Holden character, a bit older than the others (excepting Trevor Howard and Oskar Homolka), is faced with proving himself, and having become one of the lads chooses that identity (by passing on The Key to his harshest critic) over the transforming love the Loren character has experienced. The happy if incredible ending (he shoves the guard aside, forces the gates open and sprints to pull himself aboard the last car, in which Loren is seated looking as if she doesn't believe it either) denies that choices have consequences that can't be fixed.Holly Martin, in The Third Man, made an even harder choice and paid the price. According to the biography, Graham Greene tried to soften the ending but Reed held firm. Evidently he lacked the clout to do so again.The DVD technology that allows rated and unrated versions to coexist on disc could be put to better use here. Let's hope the negatives have been preserved.",4,Why not a DVD with both endings?,1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,1366,"['saw', 'film', 'original', 'downbeat', 'ending', 'Davenport', 'Iowa', '1958', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'test-market', 'showing', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'biography', 'version', 'was', 'never', 'distributed', 'States', 'recall', 'Holden', 'character', 'locked', 'station', 'gates', 'train', 'departed', 'driver', ""'ll"", 'find', ""'ll"", 'find', 'next', 'time', 'get', 'up', 'London', 'Sure', 'will', 'driver', 'beginning', 'Holden', 'character', 'bit', 'older', 'others', 'excepting', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'Oskar', 'Homolka', 'faced', 'proving', 'having', 'become', 'one', 'lads', 'identity', 'passing', 'Key', 'harshest', 'critic', 'transforming', 'love', 'Loren', 'character', 'experienced', 'happy', 'incredible', 'ending', 'guard', 'aside', 'gates', 'open', 'sprints', 'pull', 'last', 'car', 'Loren', 'seated', 'looking', ""n't"", 'believe', 'choices', 'have', 'consequences', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fixed.Holly', 'Martin', 'Third', 'Man', 'made', 'even', 'harder', 'choice', 'paid', 'price', 'According', 'biography', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'tried', 'soften', 'ending', 'Reed', 'held', 'firm', 'Evidently', 'lacked', 'clout', 'do', 'so', 'again.The', 'DVD', 'technology', 'rated', 'unrated', 'versions', 'coexist', 'disc', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'better', 'use', 'here', 'Let', 'hope', 'negatives', 'have', 'been', 'preserved']",N/A
163073,AGGC3BHIG6A5K,0800130731,Rick Lane,"[6, 6]","Finally SONY puts ""The Key"" on their Choice Collection. This is a great Drama set during WWII with William Holden as a Canadian sergeant brought to England to bring in crippled ships damaged by German torpedoes. This movie also star; Sophia Loren, Trevor Howard, Kieron Moore, Bernard Lee, Bryan Forbes, plus others! The movie is presented in Widescreen, B&W and runs for about 134mins (2hrs 14mins). The quality of the movie is really good and there isn't any special features, subtitles or other audio except English. The only problem I have is that SONY didn't put the time, aspect ratio or color on the back. Overall this is a great movie and I would recommend this.",5,The Key,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,670,"['Finally', 'SONY', 'Key', 'Choice', 'Collection', 'great', 'Drama', 'set', 'WWII', 'William', 'Holden', 'Canadian', 'sergeant', 'brought', 'England', 'bring', 'crippled', 'ships', 'damaged', 'German', 'torpedoes', 'movie', 'also', 'star', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'Kieron', 'Moore', 'Bernard', 'Lee', 'Bryan', 'Forbes', 'others', 'movie', 'presented', 'Widescreen', 'B', 'W', '134mins', '2hrs', '14mins', 'quality', 'movie', 'really', 'good', ""n't"", 'special', 'features', 'subtitles', 'other', 'audio', 'English', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'SONY', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'time', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'color', 'back', 'great', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend']",N/A
