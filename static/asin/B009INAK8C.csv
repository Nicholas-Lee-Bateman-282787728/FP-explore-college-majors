1596947,A20TD5PADOEGFE,B009INAK8C,Elyse Wheeler,"[2, 2]","I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Undercover Bridesmaid was really quite clean. There was a few utterances of mild crude language; drinking alcohol in several scenes and smoking of a cigar; women wearing low cut shirts, kissing by a few couples, a woman thinks an engaged man was &#34;making out&#34; with the maid but she realizes later she misunderstood what was happening, a bride intimates she and her husband-to-be are waiting for marriage before having sex, and (since the star is a bodyguard) a girl receives several notes containing death threats, a woman uses kicks and punches, shoots images of criminals during target practice, a bomb is placed in a unique place but is detonated before it can hurt anyone and guns are seen in several scenes.  It is not rated and the Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for 12+.I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and bought it as soon as it came to DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.I liked the two main characters, Tanya and Jake.  You get the impression that the bride that Tanya is hired to protect is at first really spoiled and ditsy, but as time goes on, you really like her as she befriends Tanya and tries to help her forgive and let go of her past.  Two of the three bridesmaids are way too bubbly and annoying if you ask me, but you get past it.Overall, I loved this movie and will continue to watch it!",5,Undercover Bridesmaid - Would Watch Again,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,1674,"['like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Undercover', 'Bridesmaid', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'clean', 'was', 'few', 'utterances', 'mild', 'crude', 'language', 'drinking', 'alcohol', 'several', 'scenes', 'smoking', 'cigar', 'women', 'wearing', 'low', 'cut', 'shirts', 'kissing', 'few', 'couples', 'woman', 'engaged', 'man', 'was', '34', 'making', 'out', '34', 'maid', 'later', 'misunderstood', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'bride', 'husband-to-be', 'are', 'waiting', 'marriage', 'having', 'sex', 'star', 'bodyguard', 'girl', 'several', 'notes', 'containing', 'death', 'threats', 'woman', 'kicks', 'punches', 'shoots', 'images', 'criminals', 'target', 'practice', 'bomb', 'placed', 'unique', 'place', 'detonated', 'can', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'guns', 'are', 'seen', 'several', 'scenes', 'not', 'rated', 'Dove', 'Foundation', 'gave', 'five', 'star', 'approved', '12+.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'again', 'originally', 'saw', 'movie', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'bought', 'as', 'soon', 'came', 'DVD', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'skip', 'think', 'too', 'predictable', '34', 'lame', '34', 'like', 'movies', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'been', '34', 'slimed', '34', 'liked', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Tanya', 'Jake', 'get', 'impression', 'bride', 'Tanya', 'hired', 'protect', 'first', 'really', 'spoiled', 'ditsy', 'time', 'really', 'like', 'Tanya', 'tries', 'help', 'forgive', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'Two', 'three', 'bridesmaids', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'bubbly', 'annoying', 'ask', 'get', 'past', 'it.Overall', 'loved', 'movie', 'will', 'continue', 'watch']",Undercover Bridesmaid

(""What would Sandra Bullock from Miss Congeniality do?"") When a Texan heiress, in the midst of her hectic wedding planning, receives threatening notes, best of the best security expert Tanya Harsin must become the Undercover Bridesmaid. Except that Tanya (Brooke Burns) happens to detest weddings, having been jilted at the altar some years ago. She pleads with her boss for an assignment in, say, the Middle East instead. But, nah, Tanya, as the sole female agent currently available in the security firm, proves too indispensable and fits in the best in the client's clique. But what happens when the impending bride, Daisy (Nicole Paggi), turns out to be this super-perky person who insists on befriending Tanya? Can the Undercover Bridesmaid maintain her icy professionalism? She's so still resenting what happened to her in the past that I'm betting: yes.If you're wondering, there is an element of mystery. To some degree, the film does follow Tanya's sleuthing around. There's no dearth of credible suspects. The angry business partner? The groom with the roving eye? The aunt siphoning the family scholarship fund? Or maybe the groom's best friend who claims to be a law student, even though there are no records supporting his claim?Hallmark Channel is self-promoted as ""the heart of television,"" and I guess 2012's UNDERCOVER BRIDESMAID is more rom-com than it is any other genre. Still, whiffs of THE BODYGUARD and MISS CONGENIALITY are inescapable. I confess that I enjoyed Brooke Burns' performance in another Hallmark venture (THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR) more so than what she does here. Partly, it's because her character is so sour grapes and takes so long to thaw out that by the time I was able to connect with her, more than half the film had elapsed. Too, the most likable character, surprisingly, is the bride-in-waiting Daisy who is so warm and sunny she easily overcomes the initial impression she'd set as this vacuous person. You - or, at least, I - wanted her to humor Daisy because Daisy is so lovable and sincere and has so much heart. So don't be startled should you find yourself connecting more with the bride than with the hard-bitten fake bridesmaid.UNDERCOVER BRIDESMAID does have its share of good moments, mostly revolving around the supremely  uncomfortable Tanya's exposure to giggly sisterhood hugs, dressing paper dolls with toilet paper, and other wacky bridesmaid activities. Credit Brooke Burns for demonstrating familiarity with weaponry and combat techniques. It's not her fault that there isn't enough solid material for her and her co-stars to work with.",3,the undercover bridesmaid versus the wedding pooper,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,2684,"['would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Tanya', 'Harsin', 'was', 'thinking', 'W.W.S.B.F.M.C.D.', 'What', 'would', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'do', 'When', 'Texan', 'heiress', 'midst', 'hectic', 'wedding', 'planning', 'threatening', 'notes', 'best', 'best', 'security', 'expert', 'Tanya', 'Harsin', 'must', 'become', 'Undercover', 'Bridesmaid', 'Tanya', 'Brooke', 'Burns', 'detest', 'weddings', 'having', 'been', 'jilted', 'altar', 'years', 'ago', 'boss', 'assignment', 'say', 'Middle', 'East', 'instead', 'nah', 'Tanya', 'sole', 'female', 'agent', 'currently', 'available', 'security', 'firm', 'too', 'indispensable', 'fits', 'best', 'client', 'clique', 'what', 'when', 'impending', 'bride', 'Daisy', 'Nicole', 'Paggi', 'out', 'be', 'super-perky', 'person', 'who', 'befriending', 'Tanya', 'Can', 'Undercover', 'Bridesmaid', 'maintain', 'icy', 'professionalism', 'so', 'still', 'resenting', 'what', 'happened', 'past', ""'m"", 'betting', 'yes.If', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'element', 'mystery', 'degree', 'film', 'follow', 'Tanya', 'sleuthing', 'around', 'dearth', 'credible', 'suspects', 'angry', 'business', 'partner', 'groom', 'roving', 'eye', 'aunt', 'siphoning', 'family', 'scholarship', 'fund', 'maybe', 'groom', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'be', 'law', 'student', 'even', 'are', 'records', 'supporting', 'claim', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'self-promoted', 'heart', 'television', 'guess', '2012', 'UNDERCOVER', 'BRIDESMAID', 'more', 'rom-com', 'other', 'genre', 'Still', 'whiffs', 'THE', 'BODYGUARD', 'MISS', 'CONGENIALITY', 'are', 'inescapable', 'confess', 'enjoyed', 'Brooke', 'Burns', 'performance', 'Hallmark', 'venture', 'THE', 'MOST', 'WONDERFUL', 'TIME', 'THE', 'YEAR', 'more', 'so', 'what', 'here', 'Partly', 'character', 'so', 'sour', 'grapes', 'so', 'long', 'thaw', 'out', 'time', 'was', 'able', 'connect', 'more', 'film', 'had', 'elapsed', 'Too', 'most', 'likable', 'character', 'surprisingly', 'bride-in-waiting', 'Daisy', 'who', 'so', 'warm', 'sunny', 'easily', 'initial', 'impression', ""'d"", 'set', 'vacuous', 'person', 'least', 'wanted', 'humor', 'Daisy', 'Daisy', 'so', 'lovable', 'sincere', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'startled', 'should', 'find', 'connecting', 'more', 'bride', 'hard-bitten', 'fake', 'bridesmaid.UNDERCOVER', 'BRIDESMAID', 'have', 'share', 'good', 'moments', 'mostly', 'revolving', 'supremely', 'uncomfortable', 'Tanya', 'exposure', 'giggly', 'sisterhood', 'hugs', 'dressing', 'paper', 'dolls', 'toilet', 'paper', 'other', 'wacky', 'bridesmaid', 'activities', 'Credit', 'Brooke', 'Burns', 'demonstrating', 'familiarity', 'weaponry', 'combat', 'techniques', 'not', 'fault', ""n't"", 'enough', 'solid', 'material', 'co-stars', 'work']",Undercover Bridesmaid
