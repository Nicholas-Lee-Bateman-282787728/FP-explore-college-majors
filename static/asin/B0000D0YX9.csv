Simply look for ""Cinefear"" or ""CF"" as the seller, and avoid it at all costs.""Sadly, I actually purchased this DVD from ""Cinefear's"" web site, and payed a hefty price for it. Without doubt, this is by far the worst transfer of any film that I have ever purchased, and this includes many of those dollar store, public domain movies. They try to play it off as ""just be glad you're able to see it at all,"" but, I'd rather not watch it than to see it like this. Trust me, it's that horrible !Not only is it a horrendous transfer, but there's also a main menu/chapter problem going on. When you press play from the main menu, it takes several minutes for the film to even start, and then it skips right over the beginning, jumping to the 2nd or 3rd chapter. You have to hit the slow-rewind button to get to the beginning, and this takes awhile.Cinefear has made quite a bit of money off this piece of junk DVD, as it was their biggest seller ever. That's OK, as we all know that Karma always comes back around and takes care of rotten, greedy, liars and crooks.""Hopefully, this film will get past all those long-ago law suits and petty greediness, and some respectable company will properly release this film as a parody of The Exorcist.",1,"Buyers beware, this is the exact same bootleg version as . .",1291680000,"12 7, 2010",2010,1299,"['other', 'version', 'offered', 'here', 'Black', 'Exorcist', 'Version', 'Simply', 'look', 'Cinefear', 'CF', 'seller', 'avoid', 'costs', 'Sadly', 'actually', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'Cinefear', 'web', 'site', 'payed', 'hefty', 'price', 'doubt', 'far', 'worst', 'transfer', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'purchased', 'many', 'dollar', 'store', 'public', 'domain', 'movies', 'try', 'play', 'off', 'just', 'be', 'glad', ""'re"", 'able', 'see', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'watch', 'see', 'Trust', 'horrible', 'Not', 'only', 'horrendous', 'transfer', 'also', 'main', 'menu/chapter', 'problem', 'going', 'When', 'press', 'play', 'main', 'menu', 'several', 'minutes', 'film', 'even', 'start', 'then', 'right', 'beginning', 'jumping', '2nd', '3rd', 'chapter', 'have', 'hit', 'slow-rewind', 'button', 'get', 'beginning', 'awhile.Cinefear', 'made', 'quite', 'bit', 'money', 'piece', 'junk', 'DVD', 'was', 'biggest', 'seller', 'ever', 'OK', 'know', 'Karma', 'always', 'back', 'care', 'rotten', 'greedy', 'liars', 'crooks', 'Hopefully', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'long-ago', 'law', 'suits', 'petty', 'greediness', 'respectable', 'company', 'will', 'properly', 'release', 'film', 'parody', 'Exorcist']",Abby

WAIT for the proper upcoming DVD of &quot;Abby&quot; instead of buying the high-price, horrible-quality, shoddily-made Cinefear disc. Why should you avoid Cinefear's bootleg disc? Well, it's detailed e.g. here - [...] - but for brevity, let me count some reasons:- &quot;Abby&quot; was, of course, shot in widescreen. Cinefear's blatant lie on the cover is just an excuse for the fact that they made their bootleg disc full-screen only.- Cinefear's &quot;transfer&quot; is an extremely ugly VHS transfer, full of tears, holes, smudges, artifacts, jumps and dirt. The sound is dull and hollow and the chapters freeze and skip. Their claim that this atrocity had been transferred from the original print is a blatant lie - you can actually find older pirate releases of &quot;Abby&quot; that look better than Cinefear's schlocky offer.- There are no &quot;many more&quot; extras that Cinefear promises. A trailer, a radio spot, a description of the film and poster reproductions are there, and that's it.- Cinefear asks the typical price of their pirate videos for &quot;Abby&quot;, a price that is considerably higher than that of legal, high-quality DVDs.Wait for the proper disc.

776858,A1UHBYL8Y2G9R9,B0000D0YX9,"russianimp ""Ed""","[1, 2]","A minister's wife becomes possessed by a demon that was probably unleashed by his father while he was excavating in Nigeria. If you take 'The Exorcist', 'The Amityville Horror' and 'Scream Blacula, Scream', and mash them all together, you have 1974's 'Abby'. I was not expecting much from this film and maybe that's why I am SO shockingly surprised at it's quality. It's not ""so bad it's good"", it's just good! Although the disco music seems out of place in a horror setting like this, the acting is decent and the story is well told. There is no doubt that the plot is a REALLY close copy of a much more popular movie, but to me that doesn't hurt it one bit. In fact when you see the lead character Abby starting to act weird, you almost feel true sorrow for her and her family because if you ever watched 'The Exorcist', and I'm sure 99.998% of you saw that film before this one, you have some idea of what is in store for them all. Because of Abby's age, they are allowed to show a little more sexual deviance which is a nice evil touch, especially from a minister`s wife. The special effects are well done and the constantly changing voices within the possessed lead female are great. The movie itself has a very creepy element to it and it is a little more action packed than it's big studio twin (slightly older twin). In fact, if you just look at it as a sequel to 'The Exorcist' rather than a rip off, I think you'll enjoy it much more. Trust me, Friedkin would much rather have 'Abby' as his sequel than the real 'Exorcist Part 2'! The crew of 'Abby' had plenty of original ideas outside of the film that they were copying and the movie deserves a lot more respect. That respect should start with a nice, clean, official release on DVD. The few copies I've seen and the one that I own are all bootleg quality with a few skips and pauses that look like they were recorded on a Beta machine back in 1979. Great film, but I would call the quality of the DVDs released so far to be well below par.",5,Lower Grade Exorcist?
