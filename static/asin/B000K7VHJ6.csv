1031556,A2FQ2M9ZIODFKV,B000K7VHJ6,Bradley Friedman,"[3, 3]","I ordered this DVD immediately and watched the entire season quickly, an impulse based on my remembered fondness for it. I have to admit that David Kelley's vision, once so daring, seems almost quaint nearly fifteen years later. Nearly all the episodes of this first season center around an ""issue"" or two - stem cell research, AIDS, Native American rights, dwarfism, menopause, state vs. church - you name it, Kelley covers it. He tries very hard to play fair by showing more than one side, and no matter which point of view ""triumphs,"" losses are sustained by both sides. In playing this game, the characters tend to become preachy, suddenly dropping character to spout statistics and didactic viewpoints in order to ""educate"" the viewers and probably invite them to take a stand. I have to admit that this became quite repetitive and even a little tiresome watching straight through this time. Other television writers have emerged who are far more witty and subtle than Kelley, whether their shows tackle issues or or character-driven. Kelley's gradual disappearance from the mainstream TV scene seems to bear witness that his voice has become a bit old hat.I know that this sounds snippy! Who am I to criticize one of the most successful writers in his field, one whose shows I really enjoyed at the time. So I say: ""Go buy this DVD"" on the strength of its wonderful cast. Fyvush Finkel has become even funnier to me now than when the show first came out, creating in Douglas Wambaugh a complex man, both ambulance chaser and seeker of justice, whose pontifications on issues are easiest of all the characters to swallow. Others here have mentioned the wonderful Ray Walston. Yes, he gets the lion's share of ""final monologues"" summing up Kelley's probable point of view on most issues as he invariably has to hand out a verdict that pleases no one due to the morass of political chicanery, legal mumbo jumbo and moral ambiguity that touches most of the plots, but he delivers these speeches with dignity and cantankerous humor.The core family, the Brocks, are warm and humane, flawed and funny. Tom Skerritt and Kathy Baker are both parental and sexy, Holly Marie Combs is wise beyond her years, and Justin Shenkarow and Adam Wylie are funny without being precious. (Shenkarow's initiation into puberty is hilarious.) The sheriff's department is also wonderful. especially Zelda Rubinstein, who has fun with her ""Poltergeist"" image but lends gravity to issues of size bigotry.I remembered the mystery plots best from before because of their twistiness, but they suffer a bit when you know the endings. Best of all are the character interactions, which include some truly wonderfully acted scenes. Don  Cheadle doesn't arrive until the second season, but I remember that he added a lot to the series as well, and I look forward to watching him.Finally, I have stated that the ""issues"" parts of the series seem now to be dated and didactic. But it is interesting to note how, fifteen years later, ,we are still struggling with many of the same issues and haven't come much further in terms of resolving our moral quandaries. This should make for some great discussions about our culture! I'm ready to discuss!!!",4,A show that shows us how far we've come,1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,3215,"['ordered', 'DVD', 'immediately', 'watched', 'entire', 'season', 'quickly', 'impulse', 'based', 'remembered', 'fondness', 'have', 'admit', 'David', 'Kelley', 'vision', 'once', 'so', 'daring', 'almost', 'quaint', 'nearly', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'Nearly', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'center', 'issue', 'two', 'stem', 'cell', 'research', 'AIDS', 'Native', 'American', 'rights', 'dwarfism', 'menopause', 'state', 'vs.', 'church', 'name', 'Kelley', 'very', 'hard', 'play', 'fair', 'showing', 'more', 'one', 'side', 'matter', 'point', 'view', 'triumphs', 'losses', 'are', 'sustained', 'sides', 'playing', 'game', 'characters', 'tend', 'become', 'preachy', 'suddenly', 'dropping', 'character', 'spout', 'statistics', 'didactic', 'viewpoints', 'order', 'educate', 'viewers', 'probably', 'invite', 'take', 'stand', 'have', 'admit', 'became', 'quite', 'repetitive', 'even', 'little', 'tiresome', 'watching', 'straight', 'time', 'Other', 'television', 'writers', 'have', 'emerged', 'who', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'witty', 'subtle', 'Kelley', 'shows', 'tackle', 'issues', 'character-driven', 'Kelley', 'gradual', 'disappearance', 'mainstream', 'TV', 'scene', 'bear', 'witness', 'voice', 'become', 'bit', 'old', 'hat.I', 'know', 'snippy', 'Who', 'am', 'criticize', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'writers', 'field', 'one', 'shows', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'say', 'Go', 'buy', 'DVD', 'strength', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'Fyvush', 'Finkel', 'become', 'even', 'funnier', 'now', 'when', 'show', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'creating', 'Douglas', 'complex', 'man', 'ambulance', 'chaser', 'seeker', 'justice', 'pontifications', 'issues', 'are', 'easiest', 'characters', 'swallow', 'Others', 'here', 'have', 'mentioned', 'wonderful', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'Yes', 'lion', 'share', 'final', 'monologues', 'summing', 'up', 'Kelley', 'probable', 'point', 'view', 'most', 'issues', 'invariably', 'hand', 'out', 'verdict', 'one', 'due', 'morass', 'political', 'chicanery', 'legal', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'most', 'plots', 'speeches', 'dignity', 'cantankerous', 'humor.The', 'core', 'family', 'Brocks', 'are', 'warm', 'humane', 'flawed', 'funny', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'are', 'parental', 'sexy', 'Holly', 'Marie', 'Combs', 'wise', 'years', 'Justin', 'Shenkarow', 'Adam', 'Wylie', 'are', 'funny', 'being', 'precious', 'Shenkarow', 'initiation', 'puberty', 'hilarious', 'sheriff', 'department', 'also', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'Zelda', 'Rubinstein', 'who', 'fun', 'Poltergeist', 'image', 'gravity', 'issues', 'size', 'bigotry.I', 'remembered', 'mystery', 'plots', 'best', 'twistiness', 'suffer', 'bit', 'when', 'know', 'endings', 'Best', 'are', 'character', 'interactions', 'include', 'truly', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'scenes', 'Don', 'Cheadle', ""n't"", 'arrive', 'second', 'season', 'remember', 'added', 'lot', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'him.Finally', 'have', 'stated', 'issues', 'parts', 'series', 'seem', 'now', 'be', 'dated', 'didactic', 'interesting', 'note', 'how', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'still', 'struggling', 'many', 'same', 'issues', 'have', ""n't"", 'come', 'much', 'further', 'terms', 'resolving', 'moral', 'quandaries', 'should', 'make', 'great', 'discussions', 'culture', ""'m"", 'ready', 'discuss']",N/A

1031576,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000K7VHJ6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","It is amazing in watching Season 1 of David E. Kelley's ""Picket Fences"" how much I remember about most of these episodes.  But then who could ever forget the Tin Man dropping dead during the town of Rome, Wisconsin's production of ""The Wizard of Oz""?  On the other hand, this time around I was shocked to realized that it was a very young Elisabeth Moss (later Zoey Barlet on ""The West Wing"") who turned to Zack after the family had caught Kimberly in bed and utters the immortal words: ""Yes, that was sex.  Naked nude sex"" (""High Tidings"").  Those words stuck with us for some time.  Nobody was ever just naked or just nude, they were always naked nude, and as for sex, it was never just sex it had to be ""naked nude sex.""  Talk about your walk down memory lane, finally having this show out on DVD provides one of the best examples of that particular experience in quite some time.I love dramedies and ""Picket Fences"" certainly counts as one.  Time and time again Douglas Wambaugh (Fyvush Finkel) shows up for the defense of everybody from ""the serial bather"" (""Frank the Potato Man"") to ""the polygamist bride"" (""Nuclear Meltdowns"") and just when you think he is a complete clown he turns and levels somebody with a scowl and a pointed remark.  It always seems to be the latter I remember better.  I find nothing much has changed when I watch these episodes again.  Carter Pike drives me crazy with his incessant demands to be deputized or dig up a corpse, but then his lousy love life (""Sightings,"" the only episode in Season 1 that does not have Kelly as at least a co-writer) renders him human again.  Deputy Maxine Steart (Lauren Holly) is almost as bad as she sees serial killers around every corner, except she was right about ""The Green Bay Chopper"" and Cupid (""Be My Valentine"").  Then there is her partner Kenny Lacos (Costas Mandylor) dating those twins (""The Body Politic"").  And these are just the supporting characters.At the heart of the show is the family Brock, where Sheriff Jimmy Brock (Tom Skerrit) give voice to Kelley's conservative impulses and his wife Dr. Jill Brock (Kathy Baker) usually gets the liberal positions (both Skerrit and Baker won Emmys for that first season, as did the series for Best Drama).  The contrastive viewpoints are necessary because Kelley clearly scanned the headlines for controversial issues to write about, from mercy killing (""Sacred Hearts"") and transsexuals (""Pageantry""), to menopause (""Bad Moons Rising""), an HIV-positive dentist (""The Body Politics""), and using fetal tissue to treat Parkinson's Disease (""Fetel Attraction"").  Actually, I was surprised that although the issue episodes stand out, there were more dealing with solving crimes, from a 10-year-old suicide (""Remembering Rosemary"") to a more recent one (""The Snake Lady""), and all the other weird cases involving ""Frank the Potato Man,"" ""The Frog Man,"" and the Chippewas who take over the courthouse because the city wants to put the 18th hole of the golf course over an ancient burial ground (""Rights of Passage"").  Seeing Kenny in the lockeroom after the standout talking about the man he killed was just as powerful the second time, as was the whole bit with Max adopting a baby (""The Lullaby League""), and who can forget guest star Dellas Reese calling Zach (Adam Wylie) ""little bittie thang"" in that one?  Which reminds me, Jimmy and Jill should trust Kimberly (Holly Marie Combs) and not freak out everytime she kisses a girl (""Sugar and Spice"") or whatever.  The kid has a good head on her shoulder and the Brocks should be open to the idea that maybe they were good parents in raising her.There are some regrets with this DVD in that the cast does not have more of a hand in the extras found on ""Picket Fences: Season 1,"" like with some nice commentary tracks.  In the featurette on the final DVD, David E. Kelly does most of the talk but all of the other principles chime in during an all too short look at how the show came together.  The show's creator expresses surprise that Judge Henry Bone became the voice of the town, but that seems absolutely inevitable given Ray Walston's virtuoso performance.  Sometimes the actor is so damn good that what they are doing so effortlessly does not constitute scene stealing.  Judge Bone simply commanded your attention every time he opened his mouth in his courtroom.  Which reminds me: not only is there a reference to ""Jimmy Berluti"" early on in Season 1 (""Remembering Rosemary""), in the pilot episode I swear that Costas Mandylor as Kenny Lacos sounds just like Michael Badalucco on ""The Practice.""  So I have the feeling that there really is a Jimmy Berluti out there in the world that Kelly is channeling through these characters.",5,"It sure is great to be able to go back to wacky Rome, Wisconsin once more",1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,4711,"['amazing', 'watching', 'Season', '1', 'David', 'E.', 'Kelley', 'Picket', 'Fences', 'how', 'much', 'remember', 'most', 'episodes', 'then', 'who', 'could', 'ever', 'forget', 'Tin', 'Man', 'dropping', 'dead', 'town', 'Rome', 'Wisconsin', 'production', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'other', 'hand', 'time', 'was', 'shocked', 'realized', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'later', 'Zoey', 'Barlet', 'West', 'Wing', 'who', 'turned', 'Zack', 'family', 'had', 'caught', 'Kimberly', 'bed', 'immortal', 'words', 'Yes', 'was', 'sex', 'Naked', 'nude', 'sex', 'High', 'Tidings', 'words', 'stuck', 'time', 'Nobody', 'was', 'ever', 'just', 'naked', 'just', 'nude', 'were', 'always', 'naked', 'nude', 'sex', 'was', 'never', 'just', 'sex', 'had', 'be', 'naked', 'nude', 'sex', 'Talk', 'walk', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'finally', 'having', 'show', 'out', 'DVD', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'particular', 'experience', 'quite', 'time.I', 'love', 'dramedies', 'Picket', 'Fences', 'certainly', 'one', 'Time', 'time', 'again', 'Douglas', 'Wambaugh', 'Fyvush', 'Finkel', 'up', 'defense', 'everybody', 'serial', 'bather', 'Frank', 'Potato', 'Man', 'polygamist', 'bride', 'Nuclear', 'Meltdowns', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'complete', 'clown', 'levels', 'somebody', 'scowl', 'pointed', 'remark', 'always', 'be', 'latter', 'remember', 'better', 'find', 'nothing', 'much', 'changed', 'when', 'watch', 'episodes', 'again', 'Carter', 'Pike', 'crazy', 'incessant', 'demands', 'be', 'deputized', 'dig', 'up', 'corpse', 'then', 'lousy', 'love', 'life', 'Sightings', 'only', 'episode', 'Season', '1', 'not', 'have', 'Kelly', 'least', 'co-writer', 'human', 'again', 'Deputy', 'Maxine', 'Steart', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'serial', 'killers', 'corner', 'was', 'right', 'Green', 'Bay', 'Chopper', 'Cupid', 'Be', 'Valentine', 'Then', 'partner', 'Kenny', 'Lacos', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'dating', 'twins', 'Body', 'Politic', 'are', 'just', 'supporting', 'characters.At', 'heart', 'show', 'family', 'Brock', 'where', 'Sheriff', 'Jimmy', 'Brock', 'Tom', 'Skerrit', 'give', 'voice', 'Kelley', 'conservative', 'impulses', 'wife', 'Dr.', 'Jill', 'Brock', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'usually', 'liberal', 'positions', 'Skerrit', 'Baker', 'won', 'Emmys', 'first', 'season', 'did', 'series', 'Best', 'Drama', 'contrastive', 'viewpoints', 'are', 'necessary', 'Kelley', 'clearly', 'scanned', 'headlines', 'controversial', 'issues', 'write', 'about', 'mercy', 'killing', 'Sacred', 'Hearts', 'transsexuals', 'Pageantry', 'menopause', 'Bad', 'Moons', 'Rising', 'HIV-positive', 'dentist', 'Body', 'Politics', 'using', 'fetal', 'tissue', 'treat', 'Parkinson', 'Disease', 'Fetel', 'Attraction', 'Actually', 'was', 'surprised', 'issue', 'stand', 'out', 'were', 'more', 'dealing', 'solving', 'crimes', '10-year-old', 'suicide', 'Remembering', 'Rosemary', 'more', 'recent', 'one', 'Snake', 'Lady', 'other', 'weird', 'cases', 'involving', 'Frank', 'Potato', 'Man', 'Frog', 'Man', 'Chippewas', 'who', 'take', 'courthouse', 'city', 'put', '18th', 'hole', 'golf', 'course', 'ancient', 'burial', 'ground', 'Rights', 'Passage', 'Seeing', 'Kenny', 'lockeroom', 'standout', 'talking', 'man', 'killed', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'powerful', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'whole', 'bit', 'Max', 'adopting', 'baby', 'Lullaby', 'League', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'guest', 'star', 'Dellas', 'Reese', 'calling', 'Zach', 'Adam', 'Wylie', 'little', 'bittie', 'thang', 'one', 'Jimmy', 'Jill', 'should', 'trust', 'Kimberly', 'Holly', 'Marie', 'Combs', 'not', 'freak', 'out', 'everytime', 'girl', 'Sugar', 'Spice', 'kid', 'good', 'head', 'shoulder', 'Brocks', 'should', 'be', 'open', 'idea', 'maybe', 'were', 'good', 'parents', 'raising', 'are', 'regrets', 'DVD', 'cast', 'not', 'have', 'more', 'hand', 'extras', 'found', 'Picket', 'Fences', 'Season', '1', 'nice', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'featurette', 'final', 'DVD', 'David', 'E.', 'Kelly', 'most', 'talk', 'other', 'principles', 'chime', 'too', 'short', 'look', 'how', 'show', 'came', 'together', 'show', 'creator', 'surprise', 'Judge', 'Henry', 'Bone', 'became', 'voice', 'town', 'absolutely', 'inevitable', 'given', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'virtuoso', 'performance', 'actor', 'so', 'damn', 'good', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'not', 'constitute', 'scene', 'stealing', 'Judge', 'Bone', 'simply', 'commanded', 'attention', 'time', 'opened', 'mouth', 'courtroom', 'Which', 'not', 'only', 'there', 'reference', 'Jimmy', 'Berluti', 'early', 'Season', '1', 'Remembering', 'Rosemary', 'pilot', 'episode', 'swear', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'Kenny', 'Lacos', 'just', 'Michael', 'Badalucco', 'Practice', 'have', 'feeling', 'really', 'Jimmy', 'Berluti', 'there', 'world', 'Kelly', 'channeling', 'characters']",N/A

(The man is eventually found n a bathtub, dead.)But, then, I'm spoiled by such recent series as 'Modern Family' and the British 'Doc Martin' (except for 3rd season, episode 4 where we find Doc Martin encountering his elderly aunt sitting on a table being () by a young handyman, her bare legs spread-eagle -- that episode can be skipped; I wonder if it was inserted later for the Japanese market.) Otherwise, they are both smart, sophisticated shows, with wit and consitency as to level, have excellent acting, directing and writing.Picket Fences was produced in 1992. So much has happened since then. This show seems to embody soe sort of transition. the themes relevant then seem almost quaint in 2011, what passes for charater develpment and depth out-dated.. Writing has evolved tremendously (but not in all cases). I had, until recently, sworn off American TV dramas or sitcoms for about thirty years (until cable) and now find Community, which is pretty good, and The Big Bang Theory (for Jim Parsons) quirky and very flawed but somehow compelling. I don't understand -- I liked Northern Exposure, which, though complicated, held together. This thing feels made by a committee and unloved.",1,Sooo irritating!

I just watched the episode where there was serial bather who broke into people's houses and took baths.

(Seinfeld based an entire series on this idea, but at least in their case it was intentional.)Then there's the other nine-point-nine percent, in which the plot involves a real problem, worthy of the main characters' attention (and, therefore, the audience's as well).  NYPD Blue, ER, and other shows with life-and-death professions fall in this category.  (At least, the good ones do.)Picket Fences, that last tenth of a percent, is the rarest of the rare, in that each episode seems to start off with the Idiot Plot, everyone getting stirred up by minor little things that should be solved easily...but then something very unusual happens.  You slowly realize that this issue is much deeper and more complex than it first seemed.  Pretty soon, the most innocuous of personality quirks has expanded into weighty moral, ethical and philosophical territory, and everyone's got an opinion worth considering, whether you agree with them or not.  Ain't no slam-dunk solutions in Rome, WI.I don't know how David Kelley did it, but he handed us the single most compelling drama series I've ever seen.  There are shows I've enjoyed more, with characters I liked better, with action that was more satisfying (action in the story sense, not just violence), but few that compelled me to think like this one did.  Even when things ended badly, horrible travesties of justice unfurling as we watched, I couldn't help but think, ""I hate it, but I can see their point.""(On the downside, the quality of the series also took the biggest, fastest nosedive in TV history in its last season, when Kelley left the show and let someone else revamp it...but that's sometimes the penalty for such a high level of excellence in the first place, I suppose.)A few other notes: No review would be complete without mentioning Ray Walston's Emmy-winning role as 'The Judge Of All The Earth', as I think of him, and I would be remiss if I didn't add that this series had one other quality achieved only by the finest of dramas: it's funny as hell.",5,"Makes you think, whether you like it or not.",1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,2203,"['Ninety', 'percent', 'stories', 'are', 'based', 'Idiot', 'Plot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'conflict', 'could', 'be', 'resolved', 'three', 'seconds', 'not', 'fact', 'everyone', 'involved', 'idiot', 'Seinfeld', 'based', 'entire', 'series', 'idea', 'least', 'case', 'was', 'intentional', 'Then', 'other', 'nine-point-nine', 'percent', 'plot', 'real', 'problem', 'worthy', 'main', 'characters', 'attention', 'therefore', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'ER', 'other', 'shows', 'life-and-death', 'professions', 'fall', 'category', 'least', 'good', 'ones', 'do', 'Picket', 'Fences', 'last', 'tenth', 'percent', 'rarest', 'rare', 'episode', 'start', 'off', 'Idiot', 'Plot', 'everyone', 'getting', 'stirred', 'up', 'minor', 'little', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'solved', 'easily', 'then', 'something', 'very', 'unusual', 'happens', 'slowly', 'realize', 'issue', 'much', 'deeper', 'more', 'complex', 'first', 'seemed', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'most', 'innocuous', 'personality', 'quirks', 'expanded', 'weighty', 'moral', 'ethical', 'philosophical', 'territory', 'everyone', 'got', 'opinion', 'worth', 'considering', 'agree', 'not', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'slam-dunk', 'solutions', 'Rome', 'WI.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'David', 'Kelley', 'did', 'handed', 'single', 'most', 'compelling', 'drama', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'more', 'characters', 'liked', 'better', 'action', 'was', 'more', 'satisfying', 'action', 'story', 'sense', 'not', 'just', 'violence', 'few', 'compelled', 'think', 'one', 'did', 'Even', 'when', 'things', 'ended', 'badly', 'horrible', 'travesties', 'justice', 'unfurling', 'watched', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'hate', 'can', 'see', 'point', 'downside', 'quality', 'series', 'also', 'took', 'biggest', 'fastest', 'nosedive', 'TV', 'history', 'last', 'season', 'when', 'Kelley', 'left', 'show', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'sometimes', 'penalty', 'high', 'level', 'excellence', 'first', 'place', 'suppose', 'few', 'other', 'notes', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'mentioning', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'Emmy-winning', 'role', ""'The"", 'Judge', 'Earth', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'series', 'had', 'one', 'other', 'quality', 'achieved', 'only', 'finest', 'dramas', 'funny', 'hell']",N/A

Nothing could be farther from the truth.The show is quirky, but not so much that it seems they are trying too hard.  The ethical situations and dilemmas that frequently pop up are well handled, not trite, and have many sides to them. Real life is rarely so black and white that you know, without a doubt, what the right thing to do is.  And this show takes that concept to an art form.The picture on the DVD is a bit grainy, and the sound, while perfectly fine, is not spectacular.

Kelley's skewed TV viewpoint became predictable, he did a wicked little number called ""Picket Fences.""Kelley first gained TV fame in the early 1990's by injecting his wry humor into Stephen Bochco's then-ailing lawyer show ""L.A. Law."" (Kelley penned the episode where wicked lawyer Rosalind Shays met her demise down a vacated elevator shaft.)After that, Kelley settled at CBS, where he created -- and wrote or co-wrote -- the first season of ""Picket Fences."" It took place in the fictional town of Rome, Wisconsin, meant to represent Everytown, U.S.A.At first glance, you had to give the show credit just for daring to be out of the ordinary. The pilot episode alone featured the town's musical production of ""Wizard of Oz,"" only to have the actor playing the Tin Man drop dead on-stage. (The town's newspaper can't resist running the headline, ""If I Only Had a Heart Attack."")As if that isn't enough, sheriff Jimmy Brock (the beautifully understated Tom Skerritt) has to contend with the town's first murder case. Mind you, no ordinary murder would do for this occasion; it consists of a housewife who was crammed into a running electric dishwasher.""Picket Fences"" never failed to exercise its flair for the bizarre. But upon second glance, the offbeat stories were merely attention-getters for some of TV's best fleshed-out characters. Among them were Jimmy's family (including Holly Marie Combs, later to star in The WB's ""Charmed""), headed by his doctor/wife Jill (Kathy Baker). And in Kelley's seeming take-off on ""Law and Order,"" the town's many legal cases were overseen by Judge Henry Bone (Ray Walston) and ambulance-chasing lawyer Douglas Wambaugh (deservedly Emmy-winning Fyvush Finkel).Rarely has a TV ensemble exploded on the scene with such gutsiness and flair. Among many first-season highlights, my favorite is the Thanksgiving episode, in which Jill must contend with the new fianc&eacute;e of her father (an Emmy-winning guest turn by Richard Kiley). The episode hinges on a scene where Jill's bitter argument with her father is counterpointed by Wambaugh's equally heated discussion with his wife. It's one of the most perfectly acted and edited pieces of television I've ever seen.Be aware that the show doesn't shy away from hot topics (though it never goes for cheap thrills or laughs, as so many ""relevant"" dramas and sitcoms do). But if you know that going in, then you'll be rewarded with some very riveting TV viewing.",5,"People who don't watch ""Picket Fences"" shouldn't throw stones at it",1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,2466,"['Back', 'David', 'E.', 'Kelley', 'skewed', 'TV', 'viewpoint', 'became', 'predictable', 'did', 'wicked', 'little', 'number', 'called', 'Picket', 'Fences', 'Kelley', 'first', 'gained', 'TV', 'fame', 'early', '1990', 'injecting', 'wry', 'humor', 'Stephen', 'Bochco', 'then-ailing', 'lawyer', 'show', 'L.A', 'Law', 'Kelley', 'penned', 'episode', 'where', 'wicked', 'lawyer', 'Rosalind', 'Shays', 'met', 'demise', 'down', 'vacated', 'elevator', 'shaft', 'Kelley', 'settled', 'CBS', 'where', 'created', 'wrote', 'co-wrote', 'first', 'season', 'Picket', 'Fences', 'took', 'place', 'fictional', 'town', 'Rome', 'Wisconsin', 'meant', 'represent', 'Everytown', 'U.S.A.At', 'first', 'glance', 'had', 'give', 'show', 'credit', 'just', 'daring', 'be', 'ordinary', 'pilot', 'episode', 'alone', 'featured', 'town', 'musical', 'production', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'only', 'have', 'actor', 'playing', 'Tin', 'Man', 'drop', 'dead', 'on-stage', 'town', 'newspaper', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'running', 'headline', 'Only', 'Had', 'Heart', 'Attack', ""n't"", 'enough', 'sheriff', 'Jimmy', 'Brock', 'beautifully', 'understated', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'contend', 'town', 'first', 'murder', 'case', 'Mind', 'ordinary', 'murder', 'would', 'do', 'occasion', 'housewife', 'who', 'was', 'crammed', 'running', 'electric', 'dishwasher', 'Picket', 'Fences', 'never', 'failed', 'exercise', 'flair', 'bizarre', 'second', 'glance', 'offbeat', 'stories', 'were', 'merely', 'attention-getters', 'TV', 'best', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'were', 'Jimmy', 'family', 'including', 'Holly', 'Marie', 'Combs', 'later', 'star', 'WB', 'Charmed', 'headed', 'doctor/wife', 'Jill', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'Kelley', 'seeming', 'take-off', 'Law', 'Order', 'town', 'many', 'legal', 'cases', 'were', 'overseen', 'Judge', 'Henry', 'Bone', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'ambulance-chasing', 'lawyer', 'Douglas', 'Wambaugh', 'deservedly', 'Emmy-winning', 'Fyvush', 'Finkel', '.Rarely', 'TV', 'ensemble', 'exploded', 'scene', 'such', 'gutsiness', 'flair', 'many', 'first-season', 'highlights', 'favorite', 'Thanksgiving', 'episode', 'Jill', 'must', 'contend', 'new', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'e', 'father', 'Emmy-winning', 'guest', 'turn', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'episode', 'scene', 'where', 'Jill', 'bitter', 'argument', 'father', 'counterpointed', 'Wambaugh', 'equally', 'heated', 'discussion', 'wife', 'one', 'most', 'perfectly', 'acted', 'edited', 'pieces', 'television', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Be', 'aware', 'show', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'hot', 'topics', 'never', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'laughs', 'so', 'many', 'relevant', 'dramas', 'sitcoms', 'do', 'know', 'going', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'very', 'riveting', 'TV', 'viewing']",N/A
