Cactus is supported by his trusty steed, Whisky; Whisky has his own since of humor. Protecting Miss Charming is Handsome Stranger (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who is sort of a Boy Scout character.

Ann-Margret held a suitcase in each hand, so Hal Needham directed me to stand behind her and hold her by the waist to keep her from falling as the train lurches to a stop. We did about eight takes and I wish there had been a dozen more! Hell, I would have paid them to do this part! What a sweet, endearing lady she was and is, and such a fine actress! On the next day's shoot, I told Arnold that if I had his amazing physique, I could be a star; ever the gracious gentleman, he told me that if he had my accent-free speaking voice, HE could be a star! (Guess who won?) Kirk Douglas was (and is) as charming and kind a gentleman as you'd ever hope to meet--not to mention an amazing actor, to boot! (See *Lonely Are The Brave*) This was not an easy role for a wonderful dramatic actor like Kirk, but he played it perfectly, like the consumate professional he is. After moving from Tucson to LA, I drove limos between acting jobs (ahem!) and became Kirk's regular driver. They just don't come any better than Kirk. Folks, enjoy this simple film for what it is: a wonderfully-directed live-action Road Runner cartoon played to the hilt by some of the country's finest actors and character actors, too. Grab a bag of hot, buttered popcorn and a cold beverage of your choice, then sit back and watch this film for what it is. You'll get a belly full of laughs.

315817,A3DCNC90MS4HVE,6302487854,cxlxmx,"[0, 2]","As the Wikipedia description says with 100% accuracy, The Villain is a loony toons cartoon brought to life with Kirk Douglas laying elaborate diabolical plans that back-fire a la Wiley Coyote.  (The loony toons theme music even plays at the end of the film.)  Schwarzenegger plays the naive and inexperienced do-gooder that he was to reprise later in Twins, and Ann-Margaret plays a seductress.  All parties turn in performances appropriate to the roles written for them.  The best character and funniest acting is Douglas' horse, Whiskey.  Not a lot of laughs, although I did get the giggles over the faux native name ""Anxious Beaver.""  And there is an unintentionally hilarious story that Schwarzenegger (HS) tells Ann-Margaret (CJ).  I have transcribed it below.  What makes it so funny is the delivery.  Schwarzenegger does act, he just recounts this anecdote in the exact same manner as he recounts anecdotes during interviews in Pumping Iron.  If you know what I'm talking about, you can see how this comes off:HS: I saw a ho bunch of crazy hoses running down dah main street of dah town.  And so I finally realized that, uh, these were runaways.  And, uh, you know, so I jumped on my hose, and I chased them down dah street.  As I ran after them, it was crazy.  Their hooves were beating on the ground.  They were going faster and faster.  I was getting faster and faster catching up with them.  And the problem really was that there were children, and women, and old men in danger on the street, you know.  And I kept going faster, and it was really a dangerous situation, you know, and I tried to save them.CJ: So you risked your life to try to stop them?HS: Yeah, I mean, uh, I do this every day. I try to do the right thing, you know, and uh, uh...CJ: Oh, how wonderful!HS: So I kept running and running after them and finally I did catch up with them.If you are tempted to try this movie, don't read any other descriptions of it, especially the Wikipedia entry, as there is only one plot twist, and it can get spoiled easily.",2,is the writer,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,2037,"['Wikipedia', 'description', '100', '%', 'accuracy', 'Villain', 'loony', 'toons', 'cartoon', 'brought', 'life', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'laying', 'elaborate', 'diabolical', 'plans', 'back-fire', 'la', 'Wiley', 'Coyote', 'loony', 'toons', 'theme', 'music', 'even', 'end', 'film', 'Schwarzenegger', 'naive', 'inexperienced', 'do-gooder', 'was', 'reprise', 'later', 'Twins', 'Ann-Margaret', 'seductress', 'parties', 'turn', 'performances', 'appropriate', 'roles', 'written', 'best', 'character', 'funniest', 'acting', 'Douglas', 'horse', 'Whiskey', 'Not', 'lot', 'laughs', 'did', 'get', 'giggles', 'faux', 'native', 'name', 'Anxious', 'Beaver', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'story', 'Schwarzenegger', 'HS', 'Ann-Margaret', 'CJ', 'have', 'transcribed', 'What', 'so', 'funny', 'delivery', 'Schwarzenegger', 'act', 'just', 'anecdote', 'exact', 'same', 'manner', 'anecdotes', 'interviews', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'off', 'HS', 'saw', 'ho', 'bunch', 'crazy', 'hoses', 'running', 'down', 'dah', 'main', 'street', 'dah', 'town', 'so', 'finally', 'realized', 'uh', 'were', 'runaways', 'uh', 'know', 'jumped', 'hose', 'chased', 'down', 'dah', 'street', 'ran', 'was', 'crazy', 'hooves', 'were', 'beating', 'ground', 'were', 'going', 'faster', 'faster', 'was', 'getting', 'faster', 'faster', 'catching', 'up', 'problem', 'really', 'was', 'were', 'children', 'women', 'old', 'men', 'danger', 'street', 'know', 'kept', 'going', 'faster', 'was', 'really', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'know', 'tried', 'save', 'them.CJ', 'So', 'risked', 'life', 'try', 'stop', 'HS', 'Yeah', 'mean', 'uh', 'do', 'day', 'try', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'know', 'uh', 'uh', 'CJ', 'Oh', 'how', 'wonderful', 'HS', 'So', 'kept', 'running', 'running', 'finally', 'did', 'catch', 'up', 'them.If', 'are', 'tempted', 'try', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'other', 'descriptions', 'especially', 'Wikipedia', 'entry', 'only', 'one', 'plot', 'twist', 'can', 'get', 'spoiled', 'easily']",N/A

The career of Kirk Douglas was winding down though it wasn't, by any means, over. The Villain was a HUGE change of pace for him. And I'm one of those people who loves to see an actor do a change up. Douglas wasn't known for comedy, though he had done one early in his career, but he was good at it. Douglas, himself, said he had made a career out of playing s.o.b.'s but this was different. Directed by actor-to-stunt-man-to-director Hal Needham who knew how to do this sort of thing. Needham became a hot commodity for a few years after he became a director & was known best for directing some of Burt Reynolds comedies.The Villain can best be described as a Roadrunner/Wile E. Coyote cartoon that's been turned into a live-action western parody. It has most of the comical routines from those cartoons: Jumping from a cliff ledge but missing the target; swinging down on a rope only to ricochet against a cliff; painting a tunnel on the side of a mountain; & pouring glue that only he gets stuck in. Kirk Douglas is a riot in his portrayal of Cactus Jack Slade. The only thing funnier is his horse, Whiskey, that steals almost every scene that he's in.The supporting cast is excellent &, in most cases, are well known. Ann-Margaret is the constantly in heat female, Charming Jones; Arnold Schwarzenegger is the incredibly straight but stupid, Handsome Stranger; Paul Lynde as Nervous Elk; Foster Brooks as the drunk bank clerk; Ruth Buzzi; Jack Elam as Avery Simpson, the dishonest banker; Strother Martin as Parody Jones; & Mel Tillis as the stuttering telegrapher.The final scene is near classic. Charming kisses Cactus Jack which sends him on a jumping binge from place to place very similar to a Daffy Duck scene.

While is in top sardonic form, Lynde does not get enough to do in his role of a Native American on the trail of cowboy Kirk Douglas.

No CGI, no cast of thousands, no destroying of a major place, just a simple story of a girl, a boy, a villain, some indians and the smartest horse ever. It's also a clone of every Warner Brothers Roadrunner/Coyote Cartoon only brought to life. What makes this work is that it's played straight, no one thinks anything is odd, save for Ann Margret who thinks ""Handsome Stranger"" (Schwarzenegger) is sexually backward. The story? Ann Margret brings her fathers gold to town, sells it and then needs to get home. Handsome Stranger is assigned to be her guide and Kirk Douglas, as Cactus Jack, is recruited to steal back the money and it's possible to tell he wouldn't mind stealing Ann Marget as well. Every sight gag used by the Coyote to get the Roadrunner is tried with the same lack of results. A tribe of Indians, led by Paul Lind as Nervous Elk, are the audience for the mistakes and foilbes and Jack's horse, Whiskey, is the smartest of all of them. The ending? Nothing you could predict but it's the perfect payoff for a vastly amusing film.

But if you remember this was one of the early spoofs, it's not so bad.  As mentioned, it's a live action Road Runner cartoon, with Kirk Douglas standing in for Wile E. Coyote.  Douglas is a very versatile actor, and he tries very hard in this movie, but he's not comic enough to be convincing.  Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Well, this is an early film and he provides the muscle without any acting chops, but he's unobtrusive.  Ann-Margret in an underwritten role is great, especially with her innuendo lines like leaning out of the train and asking Ahnuld to ""take hold of these.""It might have been better had there been MORE slapstick scenes and less of things like the countless vistas showing the wagon, or the inclusion of Paul Lynde as a Paul Lynde Indian.

The comedy is so slapstick and the dialogue so screwball, one cannot help but wonder what the heck Kirk Douglas is doing in a film like this!  Perhaps he was cleansing himself of the debacle that was ""The Fury"".That being said, all the actors in the film play it with the earnestness all good comedy needs to succeed.  Hal Needham, in the middle hour of his directing heyday, acquits himself well without his usual lead actor Burt Reynolds.  Needham plays up the material for all it is worth, achieving the same type of real world/cartoon symmetry ""Roger Rabbit"" is famed for.  Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a hilarous splash against type as a noble cowboy whose name constitutes one of the best gags in the film.  In fact, it is the three leads that make ""The Villain"" a worthwhile and easy watch, as their ""for keeps"" performances eliminate the self-mocking mail-in performances that doom many mediocre projects.Therefore, either for the cult film enthusiast or casual viewer, this would be an easy recommendation for purchase or rental.  HOWEVER, the DVD release of this film gets the glaring 1 (wish it was zero) rating for the increasingly emerging cardinal sin of DVD's - a pan & scan only release with minimal to no extras.  According to reports, various consumer focus groups and studies have led studios to believe people are intimidated by the letterboxing black bars and want the safety, familiarity, and cropped comfort of full-screen.  Why they wouldn't offer both (especially with no extras) is beyond me.  Why they would think a film with a small, but dedicated following would accept this is equally beyond me.
