The instructions are pretty good.  Its a good off day yoga routine.The sculpting was disappointing.  First of all, you have to buy extra equipment (Green Genie Balls).  You can get them at Wal Mart for half of what Karen Voight's website wants.  The routine starts with some clunky cardio that's hard to follow.  The instructions are poor.

694303,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0000639GT,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[4, 4]","In Yoga & Sculpting, instructor Karen Voight has packaged two of her previous workouts on one DVD.  I have outlined each of these two workouts below.YogaSculpt is a 45-minute workout which combines classic yoga poses with innovative twists to turn up the intensity and focus on sculpting. Karen begins the workout with a relaxing breathing exercise but then quickly steps up the pace with a challenging sequence which combines down dog with high push up pose. The standing series includes traditional yoga poses such as Warrior 1, Warrior 2, and Triangle pose, but Karen combines each pose with extra lengthening and stretching moves. The first half of workout, which can be selected separately on the DVD menu (YogaFlow), is 25 minutes, and then it's on to the floor for matwork focused on the abdominals and back.  In this section, Karen combines yoga poses such as Boat and Bridge with Pilates-type movements. Both the abs and the back receive thorough attention, and then the practice ends with a brief stretch.  On the DVD menu, this section can be selected as a stand-alone practice as well; it is listed as ""Pilates Matwork"" and labelled as being 20 minutes long, but I timed it as less.  Although Karen is an excellent instructor who performs the workout fluidly and with flawless form, there were a few times when I felt that she failed to adequately cue a change in movement.  Overall, this is a challenging yet relaxing workout which may add some nice variety for those with some prior experience in yoga.Core Essentials has been marketed under several other names, including Pilates Core Essentials and Core Plus More.  It is 40-minute, full-body toning workout similar to the first half of one of Karen's other videos, Streamline Fitness.  The workout begins with a simple, 4 minute warm-up to get your body moving; this is followed by 8 minutes of standing strength moves. The exercises consist of traditional squats and crunches, but Karen makes them unique by adding more movement. Although her cuing is excellent, I found this section to be a bit hard to follow, particularly given that the arm movements didn't seem well-suited to the leg work.  Karen then moves to the floor and continues the legwork with extensions done both on all fours and on the side; she sometimes uses her weighted ""genie balls,"" but the moves are challenging enough without the added weight! She also targets the arms with a tough push-ups sequence as well as performs several exercises with dumbbells. Karen ends the workout with ab and back exercises followed by a 6 minute cool down.  The DVD menu offers options to do several components of this workout separately:  Legs & Buttocks (10 min.), Arms & Back (5 min.), and Abdominals (5 min.).Both of these workouts are unique and different, and they may be a good option for those who would like to incorporate more core work into their strength training but who don't enjoy traditional Pilates workouts.  Finally, I feel that this DVD would be best suited to exercisers at an advanced beginner or early intermediate level.",4,Two previously released workouts (YogaSculpt and Core Essentials) on one DVD,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,3068,"['Yoga', 'Sculpting', 'instructor', 'Karen', 'Voight', 'packaged', 'two', 'previous', 'workouts', 'one', 'DVD', 'have', 'outlined', 'two', 'workouts', 'below.YogaSculpt', '45-minute', 'workout', 'classic', 'yoga', 'poses', 'innovative', 'twists', 'turn', 'up', 'intensity', 'focus', 'sculpting', 'Karen', 'workout', 'relaxing', 'breathing', 'exercise', 'then', 'quickly', 'up', 'pace', 'challenging', 'sequence', 'down', 'dog', 'high', 'push', 'up', 'pose', 'standing', 'series', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'poses', 'such', 'Warrior', '1', 'Warrior', '2', 'Triangle', 'pose', 'Karen', 'pose', 'extra', 'lengthening', 'stretching', 'moves', 'first', 'half', 'workout', 'can', 'be', 'selected', 'separately', 'DVD', 'menu', 'YogaFlow', '25', 'minutes', 'then', 'floor', 'matwork', 'focused', 'abdominals', 'back', 'section', 'Karen', 'yoga', 'poses', 'such', 'Boat', 'Bridge', 'Pilates-type', 'movements', 'abs', 'back', 'receive', 'thorough', 'attention', 'then', 'practice', 'brief', 'stretch', 'DVD', 'menu', 'section', 'can', 'be', 'selected', 'stand-alone', 'practice', 'as', 'well', 'listed', 'Pilates', 'Matwork', 'labelled', 'being', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'timed', 'less', 'Karen', 'excellent', 'instructor', 'who', 'workout', 'fluidly', 'flawless', 'form', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'felt', 'failed', 'adequately', 'cue', 'change', 'movement', 'Overall', 'challenging', 'yet', 'relaxing', 'may', 'add', 'nice', 'variety', 'prior', 'experience', 'yoga.Core', 'Essentials', 'been', 'marketed', 'several', 'other', 'names', 'including', 'Pilates', 'Core', 'Essentials', 'Core', 'Plus', 'More', '40-minute', 'full-body', 'toning', 'workout', 'similar', 'first', 'half', 'one', 'Karen', 'other', 'videos', 'Streamline', 'Fitness', 'workout', 'simple', '4', 'minute', 'warm-up', 'get', 'body', 'moving', 'followed', '8', 'minutes', 'standing', 'strength', 'moves', 'exercises', 'consist', 'traditional', 'squats', 'crunches', 'Karen', 'unique', 'adding', 'more', 'movement', 'cuing', 'excellent', 'found', 'section', 'be', 'bit', 'hard', 'follow', 'particularly', 'given', 'arm', 'movements', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'well-suited', 'leg', 'work', 'Karen', 'then', 'floor', 'legwork', 'extensions', 'done', 'fours', 'side', 'weighted', 'genie', 'balls', 'moves', 'are', 'challenging', 'enough', 'added', 'weight', 'also', 'arms', 'tough', 'push-ups', 'sequence', 'as', 'well', 'performs', 'several', 'exercises', 'dumbbells', 'Karen', 'workout', 'ab', 'back', 'exercises', 'followed', '6', 'minute', 'cool', 'down', 'DVD', 'menu', 'offers', 'options', 'do', 'several', 'components', 'workout', 'separately', 'Legs', 'Buttocks', '10', 'min', 'Arms', 'Back', '5', 'min', 'Abdominals', '5', 'min', '.Both', 'workouts', 'are', 'unique', 'different', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'option', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'incorporate', 'more', 'core', 'work', 'strength', 'training', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'traditional', 'Pilates', 'workouts', 'Finally', 'feel', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'suited', 'exercisers', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'early', 'intermediate', 'level']",N/A

694307,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0000639GT,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[7, 8]","1. First Workout - YOGASCULPTKaren Voight's two workouts will leave you refreshed and invigorated. Once I have completed the first challenging workout I feel stretched, strengthened, toned and very peaceful. If you are just starting out, be patient with yourself. Yoga will develop patience, character and strength. Think of each posture as a goal. By the third or fourth time, you may achieve what you see. This video is a combination of Pilates and Yoga. Ordering a sticky mat is essential so you don't injure your muscles by slipping on a carpeted surface. The choices for the Yogasculpt workout include:Full Workout 45 minutesYoga Flow 25 minutesPilates Matwork 20 minutesKaren's calming voice leads you through the poses in her organized way. The music is very relaxing and almost makes this the Nordstrom of Yoga videos. I recommend walking before attempting the stretching exercises. This helps to warm the muscles and allow for a deeper stretch. The flowing postures are healing and you move from a standing pose to downward dog and then to some cat stretches. Plank follows with some challenging legwork and there is a creative series for hips where your balance is tested. In the matwork boat pose makes its appearance as do many pilates exercises for the abs.2. Second Workout - CORE ESSENTIALS (Same workout as Core Plus More 1999)""I'll show you how to minimize wasted energy while maximizing concentration on the targeted muscles of your core essentials."" ~ Karen VoightIn ""Core Essentials,"" Karen Voight presents a workout to target the core muscle groups. She also focuses on the arms and legs by using weights to increase the intensity. The added resistance increases your efforts so on exercises for the abs, holding weights above the head while doing a crunches makes them super effective. As always Karen emphasizes proper form to optimize your results. The main sections of the workout include:Aerobics - Warm upLegs & Butt 10 minutesArms, Back & Torso 5 minutesAbdominals 10 minutesCool down - StretchThe workout begins with a brief aerobics section to warm up the muscles then moves right into leg exercises inspired by Pilates. She uses her green genies (weighted balls) to increase the resistance. The main workout is on a round blue platform and she is wearing a ruby outfit so the colors are interesting.During the Arms, Back & Torso workokut she does quite a few sets of push-ups which I found challenging when combined with Plank. Next you use weights while you are on your back and then move into a cool down with unique side stretches and plenty of attention to stretching out the legs.Overall, I'd say this is a challenging workout with unique exercises. Karen Voight's teaching style is very precise so the cueing is always excellent and you feel like you have completed a calorie-burning workout with an artistic appeal.~The Rebecca Review",5,Yoga & Pilates - Two Workouts,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,2872,"['1', 'First', 'Workout', 'YOGASCULPTKaren', 'Voight', 'two', 'workouts', 'will', 'leave', 'refreshed', 'invigorated', 'Once', 'have', 'completed', 'first', 'challenging', 'workout', 'feel', 'stretched', 'strengthened', 'toned', 'very', 'peaceful', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'be', 'patient', 'Yoga', 'will', 'develop', 'patience', 'character', 'strength', 'Think', 'posture', 'goal', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'may', 'achieve', 'what', 'see', 'video', 'combination', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'Ordering', 'sticky', 'mat', 'essential', 'do', ""n't"", 'injure', 'muscles', 'slipping', 'carpeted', 'surface', 'choices', 'Yogasculpt', 'workout', 'include', 'Full', '45', 'minutesYoga', 'Flow', '25', 'minutesPilates', 'Matwork', '20', 'minutesKaren', 'calming', 'voice', 'leads', 'poses', 'organized', 'way', 'music', 'very', 'relaxing', 'almost', 'Nordstrom', 'Yoga', 'videos', 'recommend', 'walking', 'attempting', 'stretching', 'warm', 'muscles', 'allow', 'deeper', 'stretch', 'flowing', 'postures', 'are', 'healing', 'move', 'standing', 'pose', 'downward', 'dog', 'then', 'cat', 'stretches', 'Plank', 'challenging', 'legwork', 'creative', 'series', 'hips', 'where', 'balance', 'tested', 'matwork', 'boat', 'pose', 'appearance', 'do', 'many', 'pilates', 'exercises', 'abs.2', 'Second', 'Workout', 'CORE', 'ESSENTIALS', 'Same', 'workout', 'Core', 'Plus', 'More', '1999', ""'ll"", 'show', 'how', 'minimize', 'wasted', 'energy', 'maximizing', 'concentration', 'targeted', 'muscles', 'core', 'essentials', '~', 'Karen', 'VoightIn', 'Core', 'Essentials', 'Karen', 'Voight', 'workout', 'target', 'core', 'muscle', 'groups', 'also', 'arms', 'legs', 'using', 'weights', 'increase', 'intensity', 'added', 'resistance', 'increases', 'efforts', 'so', 'exercises', 'abs', 'holding', 'weights', 'head', 'doing', 'crunches', 'super', 'effective', 'always', 'Karen', 'proper', 'form', 'optimize', 'results', 'main', 'sections', 'workout', 'include', 'Aerobics', 'Warm', 'upLegs', 'Butt', '10', 'minutesArms', 'Back', 'Torso', '5', 'minutesAbdominals', '10', 'minutesCool', 'down', 'StretchThe', 'workout', 'brief', 'aerobics', 'section', 'warm', 'up', 'muscles', 'then', 'right', 'leg', 'exercises', 'inspired', 'Pilates', 'green', 'genies', 'weighted', 'balls', 'increase', 'resistance', 'main', 'workout', 'round', 'blue', 'platform', 'wearing', 'ruby', 'outfit', 'colors', 'are', 'interesting.During', 'Arms', 'Back', 'Torso', 'quite', 'few', 'sets', 'push-ups', 'found', 'challenging', 'when', 'combined', 'Plank', 'Next', 'use', 'weights', 'are', 'back', 'then', 'move', 'cool', 'down', 'unique', 'side', 'stretches', 'plenty', 'attention', 'stretching', 'out', 'legs.Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'challenging', 'workout', 'unique', 'exercises', 'Karen', 'Voight', 'teaching', 'style', 'very', 'precise', 'cueing', 'always', 'excellent', 'feel', 'have', 'completed', 'calorie-burning', 'workout', 'artistic', 'appeal.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
