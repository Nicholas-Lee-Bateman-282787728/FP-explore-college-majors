The Three Pickers.We are lucky that Earl and Doc, though getting on in years, were still performing this well at the time of this video recording.  So many performances of past artists only exist on cd's or scratchy old 45's, LP's, and 78's.  For those of us who cannot attend live performances, recordings like this are amazing, and we can only be eternally grateful that we can get to see them at all. Except for the sudden editing and occasionally intrusive  production commentary, which were no fault of the artists, I have no real complaints about this album. I enjoyed the otherwise informal atmosphere of this performance for public television. Doc and Earl, God bless. May you rest in peace.",4,"Doc , Earl, and Ricky, -making good music.",1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,743,"['Earl', 'Scruggs', 'Doc', 'Watson', 'Ricky', 'Skaggs', 'Three', 'Pickers.We', 'are', 'lucky', 'Earl', 'Doc', 'getting', 'years', 'were', 'still', 'performing', 'well', 'time', 'video', 'recording', 'So', 'many', 'performances', 'past', 'artists', 'only', 'exist', 'cd', 'scratchy', 'old', '45', 'LP', '78', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'attend', 'live', 'performances', 'recordings', 'are', 'amazing', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'eternally', 'grateful', 'can', 'get', 'see', 'sudden', 'editing', 'occasionally', 'intrusive', 'production', 'commentary', 'were', 'fault', 'artists', 'have', 'real', 'complaints', 'album', 'enjoyed', 'otherwise', 'informal', 'atmosphere', 'performance', 'public', 'television', 'Doc', 'Earl', 'God', 'bless', 'May', 'rest', 'peace']",N/A
