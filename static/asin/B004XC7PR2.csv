A lot of times, I'll just listen to Bob talking in the background while I do something else.  He's just so soothing to listen to.The mountain scenes were always my favorite, so this collection is great for me.  I'd love to get the entire series, but it costs over $1000.  So, ~$30 was well worth some nostalgia for me.The video quality is good.  It's not high-def like blu-ray, but it's still pleasing to watch.  Audio is also good - not great, but good.  The baseline volume fluctuates from episode to episode sometimes, so I find myself turning the volume up and then back down.  That's a minor nit, though.  I run audio through my receiver, and I turn on surround sound processing so that his voice plays through my center channel instead of the front two speakers - that just sounds more natural to me (probably because I grew up with his voice playing through a single speaker on a TV).Some notes:(*) The audio is stereo and not 5.1 as the cover photo states.(*) The cover photo says ""Full Screen,"" but that stands for the ""old"" full screen ratio of 4:3.  If you have a widescreen TV, your TV and/or disc player can almost surely stretch the image to fill the whole screen if you prefer that, but I like to keep it at 4:3 to show the original aspect.A bit pricey in general, IMO, but still worth it.  Highly recommended, especially if you're already a fan.  You can also check if your local PBS station still shows The Joy of Painting (mine still does from time to time).",4,"So relaxing to watch, and it really brings back memories",1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,1585,"['grew', 'up', 'show', 'love', 'watching', ""'m"", 'not', 'painter', 'love', 'watch', 'do', 'lot', 'times', ""'ll"", 'just', 'listen', 'Bob', 'talking', 'background', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'just', 'so', 'soothing', 'listen', 'to.The', 'mountain', 'scenes', 'were', 'always', 'favorite', 'so', 'collection', 'great', ""'d"", 'love', 'get', 'entire', 'series', '1000', 'So', '~', '30', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'nostalgia', 'me.The', 'video', 'quality', 'good', 'not', 'high-def', 'blu-ray', 'still', 'pleasing', 'watch', 'Audio', 'also', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'baseline', 'volume', 'fluctuates', 'episode', 'episode', 'sometimes', 'find', 'turning', 'volume', 'up', 'then', 'back', 'down', 'minor', 'nit', 'run', 'audio', 'receiver', 'turn', 'surround', 'sound', 'processing', 'voice', 'plays', 'center', 'channel', 'instead', 'front', 'two', 'speakers', 'just', 'more', 'natural', 'probably', 'grew', 'up', 'voice', 'playing', 'single', 'speaker', 'TV', '.Some', 'notes', '*', 'audio', 'stereo', 'not', '5.1', 'cover', 'photo', 'states', '*', 'cover', 'photo', 'Full', 'Screen', 'old', 'full', 'screen', 'ratio', '4:3', 'have', 'widescreen', 'TV', 'TV', 'and/or', 'disc', 'player', 'can', 'almost', 'surely', 'stretch', 'image', 'fill', 'whole', 'screen', 'prefer', 'like', 'keep', '4:3', 'show', 'original', 'aspect.A', 'bit', 'pricey', 'general', 'IMO', 'still', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'especially', ""'re"", 'already', 'fan', 'can', 'also', 'check', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'still', 'Joy', 'Painting', 'mine', 'still', 'time', 'time']",N/A

A few years ago I tried painting and had done it for awhile and liked it.  But then got busy and haven't painted in quite awhile and hoped to start again.  I also bought the Bob Ross 9 one-hour instructional DVD's.  Both sets are exceptional and show you set by step what to do.

I found it amazingly hypnotic watching him turn a blank canvas into a stunning scene in just half an hour. His character was as wierd as his hair but most enjoyable to watch.
