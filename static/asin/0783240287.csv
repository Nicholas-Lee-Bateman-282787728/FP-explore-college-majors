Andrew Lloyd Webber is so good and this one hops from country twang for one song to French parody for another to some truly beautiful songs. The story is done humorously and the action moves fast. The narrator is good and bops around the scenes, singing well and showing reactions to other characters. I saw the play on stage in town and this version is good in that it starts with the actors as teachers with an auditorium of children. Later you see the actors as brothers of Joseph and Pharaoh and Potiphar and such. Now, Donny Osmond as Joseph is a bit improbable but he does sing well, and his &#34;Close Every Door&#34; song was good and maybe great. Was it sad to have one of the few black singers be the one to sing the calypso song?  A little unimaginative?The lyrics are clever for the whole play (Tim Rice?) and it is fun watching the big stars play some of the roles (Joan Collins as Potiphar's wife, for one).  I enjoyed it more on the little screen (my TV is small) than I enjoyed the on-stage show.

It was so incredible that now, more than 25 years later I can still remember the lyrics to all the songs. Today, I rented a copy on VHS and for more than an hour I happily sang along with the cast. To my complete joy I found myself as amazed as I was as a kid. Donny Osmond is a perfect charismatic Joseph. Maria Friedman is great as the narrator. The songs are fabulous and the story is obviously timeless. All actors are wonderful and you can tell they were all having fun. I knew I would like this new version of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT, but I had no idea I would fall in love again.

The creative use of the children in a school theatre setting, the lighting, the sets and the costumes are very well done. Visually, it is a feast! Yes, there were some risque scenes, that makes me think twice about showing it to children. How come? This is a musical designed for kids? About one of the most moral characters in the Bible. However, there is a control, it's called 'the fast forward button'. Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber certainly take the micky out of the Elvis cult by portraying Pharoah as 'The King'. I liked this piece of satire, especially when he rips of his headpiece and shows that 50's hair-style! Musically, the show has plenty of energy and some pathos. Donny Osmond's rendition of 'Close Every Door', is sung very slowly and is full of emotion and feeling. It is the highlight of the show. I felt that Joan Collins did an excellent job as the narrator.

68544,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,0783240287,Deborah Earle,"[1, 1]","This 1990s take on Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1968 children's musical, based on the Old Testament  story of Joseph and his brothers gives even more freshness and depth to the ancient tale, though perhaps some scenes in this version are too suggestive for children.Donny Osmond, who has a bit of experience in being a second youngest brother in a large family of brothers with the brightest spotlight shining on him is perfectly cast as the titular Joseph--a role he played onstage for many years prior to this televised version.The production begins as a school assembly event as uniformed British schoolchildren take their seats and the teaching staff take their places.Soon the tardy narrator, Maria Friedman, arrives, and stumbles while making her way to the stage, to the amusement of many of the children assembled.But she will lead the audience though a dramatic and fantastic tale. After Friedman's skillful introduction  via a song about dreams, we are introduced to the family of the Biblical patriarch, Jacob(Sir Richard Attenborough), and ten of his eleven sons, including Reuben (Nicholas Colicos), Levi(David Higgins), Asher(Martin Gallaghan), Dan (Sebastian Torkia),Simeon(Jeff Blumenkranz), Naphtali(Shaun Henson), Zebulun(Michael Small),Issachar(Patrick Clancey), Gad( Peter Challis)Judah(Gerry McIntire), and Benjamin( Nick Holmes). Joseph's introduction cues Osmond to  lead the children in the light, upbeat stanzas of the bouncy, ""Any Dream Will Do"".We learn of Joseph's reception of a coat of many colors from his father, earning his brothers ire and resentment. They also resent his telling them his dreams of their being second fiddle to him.They decide to do away with him one day, and initially toss him into a well, sans his coat. Initially planning to leave him for dead,  they change plans and sell him into slavery,  smearing his precious coat with goat's blood and, via the Country-Western style song, ""One More Angel in Heaven"", lying to Jacob about his favorite son's so-called demise.Now a slave in Egypt, Joseph begins working for the Captain, Potiphar(Ian McNiece), and through a cutesy song , we learn that Joseph grows to like his master and works for him with devotion, but Potiphar's wife (Joan Collins) makes advances towards a reluctant Joseph. When caught in a compromising position, in which he was placed against his will, Joseph his arrested  and incarcerated, and we go from the mournful, ""Close Every Door to Me"" through the upbeat and contemporary ""Go, Go, Go, Joseph!"" as the central figure rises from utter despair to being able to use his gift for interpreting dreams to predict the fates of a butler(Alex Jennings) and a baker(Christopher Biggins), who are his fellow inmates.Soon the Pharoah (Robert Torti)is in need of someone to interpret the meanings of his dreams, and the butler recommends Joseph, who realizes that his big moment is at hand.As we learn how they rock'n'roll in Egypt, the Pharaoh explains his dreams to the young Levite, who interprets duly, stating that the dreams are a warning about the need for preparation for an approaching famine, and the need to ration during the next seven years. Joseph is put in charge of directing the effort, and we see how everything in his life prepared him to be where he is at this moment.Via a Basque lament we learn that Joseph's family miss him and that they have been adversely affected by the famine. They decide to go to Egypt.A cool jazz number  is the expression under which the brothers reunite although they no longer recognize their long lost brother. Friedman, who has insinuated herself into the story throughout, seems to especially gain pleasure as the brothers grovel. The ""Benjamin Calypso"" is the segway to a reconciliation.Various musical styles, and the obvious enjoyment of the participants give this production something for everyone, and it is especially brightened by the participation of children.

It is light, superficial entertainment that an entire family can enjoy, and there's nothing wrong with that.  However, when a production of  such a show is as ludicrous as this one, there is a problem.  First there  is the Assembly within a show concept.  Throughught the movie There are  these little pericriol school children who get up and clap after big  production numbers as if to say to us the viewers: &quot;That was supposed  to be impressive.&quot;  Sometimes, such as during &quot;Close Every Door  To Me&quot; they just start singing along holding candles that apparently  fell out of the sky (like most of the plot and story).  Other parts of the  movie are just cheesey.  The director tried to maintain most of the  elements of the recent stage production, which didn't transfer well to  film.  The performances, with the exception of Osmand's, play to the back  of the auditorium, not the camera that is right in their face.  Thus,  everyone looks phony.  If they wanted to preserve the elements of the stage  production, they should have just videotaped a live performance of the  stage production.There are some good things about this movie.  Osmand  is a pretty good Joeseph.  He brings the right level of fun and  wholesomeness to the role without overacting, looking fake, or appearing  maudlin.  Many of the musical numbers are generally entertaining, and the  cast is very good vocally.  The score isn't great, but its gimicky  production numbers and pop ballads fit the show well.  This show tries to  be family fun, and on many levels it is.  It is definately appropriate for  the whole family, and younger people (I'd say jr. high on down for girls,  5th grade on down for boys) will find it enjoyable.  Some parents may find  it cute and most will find it tolerable.  However, the bottom line is it  isn't that good.

How much more proof do you need that this is a complete waste of existance?It starts off with a bunch of screaming little kids running around in an auditorium, presumably at an elementary school.

Both vocally and in the acting department, he raises the bar for every other Joseph out there. He captures the character's naivete and simultaneous intelligence pitch-perfect, his dazzling smile embodies the character's undying optimism, and his lovely clear tenor is perfectly suited to the singing role.  I personally did like the Narrator quite a lot. She's quite funny, and her voice is very pretty. It's true that she's not belting the high notes very strongly - her vocal stylisms are more operatic than the average Broadway soprano, but I think it makes her interpretation unique and adds a quiet intensity that is normally not found in the role.There are some flaws.  For example, I found the Mrs. Potiphar scene unnecessarily graphic.  Though Ms. Collins looks gorgeous for her age, and acts the part with irascible charm, her costume is largely a flesh-colored leotard with a few strategic bunches of purple sequins. It looks as though she's nude and wearing pasties.  The entire instrumental sequence of that scene, which in the stage version is usually just an over-the-top ""seduction"" scene, is replaced here with a simulated orgy.  I always cover my 6yo's eyes during that part. ;)  I also agree with the other reviewers who said that the Baker and the Butler were really lifeless and sang terribly, and Jacob was expressionless throughout.  His version of ""distraught grief"" was to stand there slightly slack jawed. Really pretty boring.But these will not deter anyone from thoroughly enjoying this video again and again, and there are many aspects of the production that will forever set the standard.  The eleven brothers were priceless, and all had very good chemistry with each other, the Narrator and Joseph.  They also all clearly had incredible voices.  The costumes were spectacular and colorful, the musical arrangement is the best I've ever heard in this show, and the pacing is compelling and consistent.  The Pharaoh slays me every time - his comedic timing and appropriately overdramatic expressions coupled with his gorgeous baritone are just sublime perfection for the role. And Donny will make you grin right back at him.In short, it's a very, very strong production that surpasses every stage version I've ever seen, and it is extremely faithful to the spirit of Webber's vision.",4,"Imperfect, but still terrific fun!",1085184000,"05 22, 2004",2004,2369,"['Donny', 'Osmond', 'would', 'seem', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'part', 'vocally', 'acting', 'department', 'bar', 'other', 'Joseph', 'there', 'character', 'naivete', 'simultaneous', 'intelligence', 'pitch-perfect', 'dazzling', 'smile', 'embodies', 'character', 'undying', 'optimism', 'lovely', 'clear', 'tenor', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'singing', 'role', 'personally', 'did', 'Narrator', 'quite', 'lot', 'quite', 'funny', 'voice', 'very', 'pretty', 'true', 'not', 'belting', 'high', 'notes', 'very', 'strongly', 'vocal', 'stylisms', 'are', 'more', 'operatic', 'average', 'Broadway', 'soprano', 'think', 'interpretation', 'unique', 'quiet', 'intensity', 'normally', 'not', 'found', 'role.There', 'are', 'flaws', 'example', 'found', 'Mrs.', 'Potiphar', 'scene', 'unnecessarily', 'graphic', 'Ms.', 'Collins', 'gorgeous', 'age', 'part', 'irascible', 'charm', 'costume', 'largely', 'flesh-colored', 'leotard', 'few', 'strategic', 'bunches', 'purple', 'sequins', 'nude', 'wearing', 'pasties', 'entire', 'instrumental', 'sequence', 'scene', 'stage', 'version', 'usually', 'just', 'over-the-top', 'seduction', 'scene', 'replaced', 'here', 'simulated', 'orgy', 'always', 'cover', '6yo', 'eyes', 'part', 'also', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'Baker', 'Butler', 'were', 'really', 'lifeless', 'sang', 'terribly', 'Jacob', 'was', 'expressionless', 'version', 'distraught', 'grief', 'was', 'stand', 'there', 'slightly', 'slack', 'jawed', 'Really', 'pretty', 'boring.But', 'will', 'not', 'deter', 'anyone', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'video', 'again', 'again', 'are', 'many', 'aspects', 'production', 'will', 'forever', 'set', 'standard', 'eleven', 'brothers', 'were', 'priceless', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'chemistry', 'other', 'Narrator', 'Joseph', 'also', 'clearly', 'had', 'incredible', 'voices', 'costumes', 'were', 'spectacular', 'colorful', 'musical', 'arrangement', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'show', 'pacing', 'compelling', 'consistent', 'Pharaoh', 'slays', 'time', 'comedic', 'timing', 'appropriately', 'overdramatic', 'expressions', 'coupled', 'gorgeous', 'baritone', 'are', 'just', 'sublime', 'perfection', 'role', 'Donny', 'will', 'make', 'grin', 'right', 'back', 'him.In', 'short', 'very', 'very', 'strong', 'production', 'stage', 'version', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'extremely', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'Webber', 'vision']",N/A

I know it's totally unrealistic for people to burst into song, and that it can easily jar someone out of the story if they're not used to it, but a well-written musical is just fun in my opinion even if (or especially if) it's cheesy and goofy.  ""Mama Mia,"" ""Bye Bye Birdie,"" ""Hairspray,"" ""Oliver!,"" Rogers and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella,"" ""Wicked,"" ""Into the Woods,"" most of Disney's animated-musical output... they're a blast.  Yes, you do get a few stinkers in the mix (such as the infamous ""Carrie"" and ""Love Never Dies""), but that's true with any genre.Although ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" is a rather... creative adaptation of the original biblical story of Joseph's coat of many colors, I find I can't nitpick the differences because it's just too much fun to watch.  The fact that a good cast of actors and singers brings it to life certainly helps.The story is familiar to anyone who's read the Bible or attended Sunday School -- Joseph is the favorite son of his father, who dotes on him to the dismay and anger of his eleven other sons.  Finally upset enough to act, the brothers gang up on Joseph and sell him into slavery in Egypt.  But Joseph, a dreamer gifted with visions of the future, manages to work his way upward in a classic rags-to-riches story, and ends up going from slave to prisoner to a noble second only to the Pharaoh himself.  The story is told in a unique format, however -- as a stage play being put on for a parochial school, with a quirky teacher serving as narrator and the children in the audience joining in as the chorus at appropriate times.  And though the original story was fairly serious, here it's not played seriously at all, and is acted out with great bombast, drama, and color.I've left a review before regarding the music of this musical (under theJoseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (1992 Canadian Cast)), but it's worth mentioning here as well.  Virtually the entire story is told in song format, and though the lyric choices are occasionally odd or sound forced, there are some clever turns of phrase and it stays surprisingly true to the Biblical story despite the wackiness and camp factor.  Most of the songs are quite catchy and lively, and they cover a wide range of styles from country to disco to calypso to rock.  And there are some truly beautiful and thoughtful numbers as well, such as ""Any Dream Will Do"" and ""Close Every Door To Me.""The acting in this film... well, let's just say that nobody involved in this film takes it seriously.  Everyone, from Donny Osmond as Joseph to the backup dancers serving as wives and servants, gleefully chews the Technicolor scenery in this film, hamming it up for the camera and belting out their lines with gusto.  Richard Attenborough as Joseph's father and Joan Collins as Potiphar's wife were a bit of a surprise to see, but they seem to be having quite a bit of fun in this as well, and Collins in particular is delightfully slinky and sinister as the ice-cold seductress.  The brothers range from okay to hilariously great -- some, like Asher and Judah, are quite memorable, while others are quickly forgotten after the film is over.  The narrator has to be my favorite character -- she steals every scene she's in, somehow managing to insert herself into the action of the story on a regular basis and serving as a sort of bridge between the audience and what's happening on stage.And since I mentioned the scenery in the last paragraph... lets just say this movie looks nothing like ancient Egypt or Canaan.  At times the sets look like theme-park versions of Biblical times, while at other times they're psychedelic in design and color.  But given the overall tone of this musical, this wasn't particularly jarring.  If anything, it just added to the over-the-top camp of the whole experience.Perhaps the greatest strength of this musical, especially this production of it, is that it doesn't take itself seriously.  It's not perfect -- some of the lyrics are cringe-inducingly forced, the costumes are weird and in some cases shockingly skimpy, and it's rather obvious a few of the actors can't sing (the butler and baker are the biggest offenders here).  But it's still incredibly fun and catchy, and it looks like everyone involved had a blast making it.Definitely worth your time if you're a fan of musicals in general (and Andrew Lloyd Webber in particular), though if you're looking for a serious biblical epic you're better off looking elsewhere.

The story is a tuneful, mostly cheerful telling of Joseph's story from his coat of many colors to slavery to power, but those looking for a reverent Bible story will be disappointed in this mocking and sarcastic show.  On the plus side, Donny Osmond is quite appealing as the innocent Joseph and sings with ease and emotion; his scenes are the best.My problems stem from the structure of the show. The action takes place on a school stage with the students often chiming in as a choir and it just doesn't gather any dramatic steam. The composers were only 19 and 21 when this was first conceived and their music is catchy and the rhymes are clever, but there's no continuity or sense of serious theatre. One never suspends disbelief because we are constantly reminded it's just a school play.The songs range from sweet to kitschy in pop, calypso, disco, and cowboy-country style. The props are painted cardboard and the costumes go from period to techno to kid-unfriendly suggestive. The narrator (Maria Friedman) has the most screen time and she's an annoying know-it-all who continually grabs the spotlight away from the action.Several of the songs are quite nice and will stick with you, especially ""Any Dream Will Do"" and ""Close Every Door,"" and Pharoah's Elvis impersonation is funny, if weird. The show was originally aimed at children, but I think they might lose interest.

I remember watching a pre-Donny Osmond staging of it at a small college theater and fell in love.  I bought the CD  of the original production by Andrew Lloyd Weber/Time Rice and listened until I had the songs memorized.  Years later, I saw the Donny Osmond version and thought he did a good job of producing it.  His voice was good and so were those of the other performers.  The singers playing Joseph's brothers were the highlight of the experience.  They were brilliant.  However, I was disappointed that they changed the narrator from an alto to a soprano.  I also didn't like some of the constumes, though I was admittedly up in the nosebleed section of his production and couldn't see the detail.  The Elvis Pharoh's number was WAY overdone in the Donny Osmond's stage production.I bought this video tape to support a local theater production and figured that owning a Donny Osmond version would be better than living without one.  I was wrong.  The singers playing the brothers were still brilliant, but that is the only good thing I can say about it.  I did not like the camera work of the movie at all.  I didn't like the opening and closing scenes they added, feeling that it didn't add any production value.  I hated most of the costumes involving Potiphar's wife and the cheerleaders in the ""Go, Go, Go Joseph"" song.  The Pharoh's scene was even more hammy than the stage production to the point of being unpalatable and most of the costumes were inappropriate.  It was, quite frankly, a raunchy production and had my kids asking questions that needed to wait until they were older to explain.

Well, Donny Osmond IS Joseph!  After seeing this, I cannot imagine anyone else playing Joseph so well, and so poignantly.  Donny has the truly perfect voice and charisma for this role.  I've have seen brief clips of other stage performances, and have heard the other stage soundtracks, and they just don't have it!  One important thing that seems to be lacking in the previous encarnations is an enthusiasm for the role, something that comes through loud and clear with Donny Osmond.  There simply is no other ""Joseph"" than him.  He is truly an underrated performer.It was great choice to film this as a ""movie"" on sets, rather than just filming a stage show.  While that would have been interesting, especially to those who had seen the play, it would not have done justice to it the way this did and would not have allowed for the varied staging that is evident here.  The casting is excellent in my opinion, although I understand from several friends who saw the Stage Production here in Boston back in 1996(ish), the Stage Elvis (Johnny Seaton) and Narrator (Janet Metz) had a higher level voice control and stage ""presence"" than is so evident here (""simply awesome"" us how one friend put it), the two certainly turn in stellar performances and their performances are entertaining and riviting.  They both have quite good voices, and Pharoah really morphs with Elvis!Given that this play was, at least originally, staged with children in mind, the costuming is a bit on the risque side, and could certainly have been done without.Andrew Lloyd Webber also missed an excellent opportunity that might be missed on most people as far as history and factual storytelling goes.  When approached by ""Mrs. Potiphar"", Joseph actually ran away from her, leaving ""his outer garment behind"", and she then falsly accused him of attempting to rape her,which is really why Potipar was so enraged.  This would've added a whole other dimension to the song ""Potiphar"" and made his false imprisonment all the more ""unjust"", which in turn, would have added to the poignancy of Donny's best song in the show, ""Close Every Door"", but, hey, that's Hollywood!  ONE WARNING!  This will leave you singing and humming the songs for weeks and weeks on end!Donny Osmond will never again wear that ""Amazing Coloured Coat"" but as long as you own this DVD, he'll never really take it off for the last time!By the way, don't pass-up the CD featuring Donny Osmond from this Stage Tour.  It is simply awesome!  In many areas, the tempo and pacing of the songs is better than in this DVD.

Your sympathy is obviously for Joseph but you find yourself being a little more understanding of his brothers' actions.I love the way the show is presented with its opening commencing in a classroom and then you are transported into the world of Joseph, his brothers, and the people of Isreal and Egypt, and then you are brought back into the  classroom at the end again.  This was done I presume to give the audience an awareness that the advent of this play was really in a school and of course Webber brought it to the world.This production gives something for people of all ages to enjoy.  My 8 year-old nephew cannot stop watching it and while this production may not follow the bible to the tee, it is a great way of introducing a biblical story to a young child.

I challenge you to name another musical with the same attributes.However, for me, the real sell in this video comes in the performances of Donny Osmond and Maria Friedman.

I listened to the original broadway cast album over and over and loved it. The songs were charming and smart, the message was honest and true, and the narrator was sung by one of the finest voices ever to grace the American stage. On the stage, the sets were minimalist and simple and supported the cast and story rather than overpowering or outshining them.This video production of the show sadly misses the spirit of the show and just doesn't have the best people singing it.This show was originally created to be preformed by students in schools. It was a low budget production that showed off talent and concepts, and splashy production wasn't required or desired. This video version is all splashy production, with very little substance or soul. It's glitzy and glittery and you end up thinking about how pretty it looks rather than feeling involved in the story or the music.Maria Friedman does a competent job as the narrator, although the role was written for a man and was, I believe, only changed for the female voice for performance by the immortal Laurie Beechman, who is sadly no longer with us. Maria is likeable enough, she'll do. Perhaps if I hadn't heard the role sung by the best, I wouldn't be so critical of her in comparison. Donny Osmond does a good job *acting* the role of Joseph, but doesn't sing it as well as the gentleman who I remember on Broadway. The rest of the cast is, well, *there*. I've seen the DVD twice and I can barely recall any of their faces, so I suppose they could be referred to as *forgettable*.I do have to admit I was amused by Joan Collins's cameo. As she sings all of one sentence, her voice is not at issue.I also particularly disliked that they've moved the song &quot;any dream will do&quot; to the beginning of the show. It was written for the end of the show, and doesn't make any sense at the beginning. It's out of context, and also I believe it was intended as an expression of angst and confusion and loss, and yet it's played as a cheerful happy song, which *really* doesn't make sense to me.This production makes me feel like Andrew Lloyd Webber has forgotten what the show is about.If there was any other version of this show available on video, I would not have bought this one.",1,A sad injustice to a sweet show,1005264000,"11 9, 2001",2001,2294,"['saw', 'show', 'broadway', 'child', 'loved', 'listened', 'original', 'broadway', 'cast', 'album', 'loved', 'songs', 'were', 'charming', 'smart', 'message', 'was', 'honest', 'true', 'narrator', 'was', 'sung', 'one', 'finest', 'voices', 'ever', 'grace', 'American', 'stage', 'stage', 'sets', 'were', 'minimalist', 'simple', 'supported', 'cast', 'story', 'rather', 'overpowering', 'outshining', 'them.This', 'video', 'production', 'show', 'sadly', 'spirit', 'show', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'people', 'singing', 'it.This', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'created', 'be', 'preformed', 'students', 'schools', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'showed', 'talent', 'concepts', 'splashy', 'production', 'was', ""n't"", 'required', 'desired', 'video', 'version', 'splashy', 'production', 'very', 'little', 'substance', 'soul', 'glitzy', 'glittery', 'end', 'up', 'thinking', 'how', 'pretty', 'rather', 'feeling', 'involved', 'story', 'music.Maria', 'Friedman', 'competent', 'job', 'narrator', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'man', 'was', 'believe', 'only', 'changed', 'female', 'voice', 'performance', 'immortal', 'Laurie', 'Beechman', 'who', 'sadly', 'no', 'longer', 'Maria', 'likeable', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'do', 'Perhaps', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'role', 'sung', 'best', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'critical', 'comparison', 'Donny', 'Osmond', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'Joseph', ""n't"", 'sing', 'as', 'well', 'gentleman', 'who', 'remember', 'Broadway', 'rest', 'cast', 'well', '*there*', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'twice', 'can', 'barely', 'recall', 'suppose', 'could', 'be', 'referred', '*forgettable*.I', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'amused', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'cameo', 'one', 'sentence', 'voice', 'not', 'issue.I', 'also', 'particularly', 'disliked', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'song', 'quot', 'dream', 'will', 'do', 'quot', 'beginning', 'show', 'was', 'written', 'end', 'show', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'beginning', 'context', 'also', 'believe', 'was', 'intended', 'expression', 'angst', 'confusion', 'loss', 'yet', 'played', 'cheerful', 'happy', 'song', '*really*', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'me.This', 'production', 'feel', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'forgotten', 'what', 'show', 'about.If', 'was', 'other', 'version', 'show', 'available', 'video', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bought', 'one']",N/A

Donny Osmond stars in this video version of the popular musical and he plays Joseph better than just about anyone else. Richard Attenborough portrays Jacob and Joan Collins has a non-singing cameo as Potiphar's Wife.The music in this play is quite enjoyable and covers a variety of genres from pop to country to calypso. My personal favorite tune is the moving ""Close Every Door"". The set in the video is rather simplistic, though extremely lavishly decorated and many of the costumes are, well, ""interesting"".The show has a couple of great morals (lessons in love and forgiveness) and other than the sexual innduendo and risque costumes in the Potiphar's Wife scene, the video is great for family. However, after watching this video I realized that Andrew Lloyd Webber may never had intended for the story to ever be taken seriously. For example, instead of displaying any of Joseph's noble qualities, he is portrayed as a buffoon until the end of the show. Also I could never quite figure out why all those kids are in the production; they are always distracting and take focus away from the story. After I watched this tape, it occurred to me that was the entire point. These things are subtle and just by listening to the soundtrack or even watching most school and church productions of the show they are nearly unnoticeable. However, they are there.

Joseph is somewhat of a cousin to that show but it is a different kettle of fish at the same time. It is clearly designed to be accessible to school children-- which is great. Kids are an audience worthy of being catered to and it's wonderful to see them becoming involved in the arts, as the DVD extras show us that English schools host their own productions. But Dreamcoat also holds much for adults who are willing to forgo pretensions in favor of fun. This is not classical theatre but it is enjoyable lightweight popular theatre, accessible to anyone with an appreciation for the wacky and zany. In short, it is entertaining. It is good music with a good message for kids--and Tim Rice's lyrics are witty as ever.Another thing this is not, however, is a religious show. Parents, note that this isn't to the Bible for kids. It's not a Christian (or Jewish) perspective; rather, it is universal. Joseph and friends are depicted no differently than if they were figures in Greek or Norse mythology; there is no special reverence nor special disdain, although the approach is light-hearted and fun-loving. It's another story. At one point, Maria Friedman, playing narrator, stumbles and drops her Bible, telegraphing that this is a non-traditionalist, possibly off-center treatment of scripture, one that absolutely requires a taste for the whimsical.I've sadly never seen the show on stage, which m I'd love to, but I do see how this rendition could disappoint one in search of the purely theatrical. However, one of two things I like is actually dependent on the filmic medium. The story is bookended as a play children are watching in school. When Joseph emerges, it becomes a blend of reality and fantasy. The lines are blurred and the action is effectively placed in a unique realm that, I find, engages the imagination. It's a bit of a throwback to the like of the 1973 film of Jesus Christ Superstar, which similarly bookends its main story as a performance of sorts. Except Dreamcoat is presented ideally for connecting with kids. At the same time, this presentation is strongly theatrical on other ways and I really appreciate getting a bit of the theatrical experience in the living room, as I do love theatre.The other thing I really like is the sheer variety. There's '50s-style rock 'n' roll with the classic Go, Go Joseph and Pharo's Dream, an outrageous Elvis imitation. There's a faux country/western ballad as Joe's bros deliciously pretend to mourn him. And there's a wonderful calypso that will get stuck in your head for days. Webber takes a pantheon of popular music styles that people love and weaves them together in storytelling. That's pop theatre. It seems typical of Webber and it's similar to the musical brilliance that makes Superstar a classic of fantastic appeal. Dreamcoat is cut from the same cloth, dyed in different hues.As to the cast, the all-star approach seems over the top but it's always nice seeing Richard Attenborough (Jacob). And I've never followed Osmond but I credit him for a good performance, making Joe warm and radiant. Watching him with the kids is a joy. The ending Coat of Many Colors sequence is marvelous, as we see the kids form a unified body of many colors on stage, and the bookending number, Any Dream Will Do, can stand as a classic entirely on its own. On the other hand, I confess that Close Every Door doesn't do as much for me as it might.The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, especially Judah, Pharo, the butler, and the baker. Friedman is amusing if over the top as narrator, a device that seems conceived to help kids understand the story. I recognized Englishman Ian McNiece as Potiphar, a delightful performance of a colorful characterization, not to be missed.In short, Dreamcoat lives up to its title: the characters are all colorful. The music is fun and the themes poignant. The story and music conjure and help to preserve a spirit of dreaming and daring to have and glorify dreams and hope, as well as a spirit of love and unity. Which is beautiful. This show could also serve as a fun way to introduce kids to musical theatre. The upbeat music, goofiness, and presence of kids in the story should help draw kids in. If I chose two words to describe Dreamcoat, they would be &#34;color&#34; and &#34;dreams&#34;, two things children should not be short of. Everyone should sew a Dreamcoat.",4,Many Colors,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,4544,"['Boy', 'wish', 'had', 'assemblies', 'when', 'was', 'school', 'was', 'introduced', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'wonderful', 'lyricist', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'Joseph', 'somewhat', 'cousin', 'show', 'different', 'kettle', 'fish', 'same', 'time', 'clearly', 'designed', 'be', 'accessible', 'school', 'children', 'great', 'Kids', 'are', 'audience', 'worthy', 'being', 'catered', 'wonderful', 'see', 'becoming', 'involved', 'arts', 'DVD', 'extras', 'show', 'English', 'schools', 'host', 'own', 'productions', 'Dreamcoat', 'also', 'much', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'forgo', 'pretensions', 'favor', 'fun', 'not', 'classical', 'theatre', 'enjoyable', 'lightweight', 'popular', 'theatre', 'accessible', 'anyone', 'appreciation', 'wacky', 'zany', 'short', 'entertaining', 'good', 'music', 'good', 'message', 'kids', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'lyrics', 'are', 'witty', 'ever.Another', 'thing', 'not', 'however', 'religious', 'show', 'Parents', 'note', ""n't"", 'Bible', 'kids', 'not', 'Christian', 'Jewish', 'perspective', 'rather', 'universal', 'Joseph', 'friends', 'are', 'depicted', 'differently', 'were', 'figures', 'Greek', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'special', 'reverence', 'special', 'disdain', 'approach', 'light-hearted', 'fun-loving', 'story', 'one', 'point', 'Maria', 'Friedman', 'playing', 'narrator', 'stumbles', 'Bible', 'telegraphing', 'non-traditionalist', 'possibly', 'off-center', 'treatment', 'scripture', 'one', 'absolutely', 'taste', 'whimsical.I', ""'ve"", 'sadly', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'stage', 'm', ""'d"", 'love', 'do', 'see', 'how', 'rendition', 'could', 'disappoint', 'one', 'search', 'purely', 'theatrical', 'However', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'like', 'actually', 'dependent', 'filmic', 'medium', 'story', 'bookended', 'play', 'children', 'are', 'watching', 'school', 'When', 'Joseph', 'blend', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'lines', 'are', 'blurred', 'action', 'effectively', 'placed', 'unique', 'realm', 'find', 'imagination', 'bit', 'throwback', 'like', '1973', 'film', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'similarly', 'main', 'story', 'performance', 'sorts', 'Dreamcoat', 'presented', 'ideally', 'connecting', 'kids', 'same', 'time', 'presentation', 'strongly', 'theatrical', 'other', 'ways', 'really', 'appreciate', 'getting', 'bit', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'living', 'room', 'do', 'love', 'theatre.The', 'other', 'thing', 'really', 'like', 'sheer', 'variety', ""'50s-style"", 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'classic', 'Go', 'Go', 'Joseph', 'Pharo', 'Dream', 'outrageous', 'Elvis', 'imitation', 'faux', 'country/western', 'ballad', 'Joe', 'bros', 'deliciously', 'pretend', 'mourn', 'wonderful', 'calypso', 'will', 'get', 'stuck', 'head', 'days', 'Webber', 'pantheon', 'popular', 'music', 'styles', 'people', 'love', 'together', 'storytelling', 'pop', 'theatre', 'typical', 'Webber', 'similar', 'musical', 'brilliance', 'Superstar', 'classic', 'fantastic', 'appeal', 'Dreamcoat', 'cut', 'same', 'cloth', 'dyed', 'different', 'hues.As', 'cast', 'all-star', 'approach', 'top', 'always', 'nice', 'seeing', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'Jacob', ""'ve"", 'never', 'followed', 'Osmond', 'credit', 'good', 'performance', 'making', 'Joe', 'warm', 'radiant', 'Watching', 'kids', 'joy', 'ending', 'Coat', 'Many', 'Colors', 'sequence', 'marvelous', 'see', 'kids', 'form', 'unified', 'body', 'many', 'colors', 'stage', 'bookending', 'number', 'Any', 'Dream', 'Will', 'Do', 'can', 'stand', 'classic', 'entirely', 'own', 'other', 'hand', 'confess', 'Close', 'Every', 'Door', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'much', 'supporting', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Judah', 'Pharo', 'butler', 'baker', 'Friedman', 'amusing', 'top', 'narrator', 'device', 'conceived', 'help', 'kids', 'understand', 'story', 'recognized', 'Englishman', 'Ian', 'McNiece', 'Potiphar', 'delightful', 'performance', 'colorful', 'characterization', 'not', 'be', 'missed.In', 'short', 'Dreamcoat', 'up', 'title', 'characters', 'are', 'colorful', 'music', 'fun', 'themes', 'poignant', 'story', 'music', 'conjure', 'help', 'preserve', 'spirit', 'dreaming', 'daring', 'have', 'glorify', 'dreams', 'hope', 'as', 'well', 'spirit', 'love', 'unity', 'Which', 'beautiful', 'show', 'could', 'also', 'serve', 'fun', 'way', 'introduce', 'kids', 'musical', 'theatre', 'upbeat', 'music', 'goofiness', 'presence', 'kids', 'story', 'should', 'help', 'draw', 'kids', 'chose', 'two', 'words', 'describe', 'Dreamcoat', 'would', 'be', '34', 'color', '34', '34', 'dreams', '34', 'two', 'things', 'children', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'short', 'Everyone', 'should', 'sew', 'Dreamcoat']",N/A

While nothing is quite like experiencing the phenomenon live, this production is excellent in its own right.For a basic plot summary, ""Dreamcoat"" follows the biblical story of Joseph (played by Donny Osmond), the youngest of the 12 sons of Jacob. Joseph, the favorite son of Jacob, is betrayed by his jealous brothers and sold into Egyptian slavery as a young man.  After languishing in prison for years in the Pharaoh's palace, Joseph is called into duty due to an incredible God-given talent for dream interpretation.There are two reasons why this production (in all its shapes and forms) has stood the test of time:1. The music is absolutely timeless.  It pulls from all genres (ballads, rock-and-roll, country, etc.) and has something for everybody.  The kids will love the silliness, while the adults will appreciate the vigor to which the actors approach their roles.2. The story is also one-of-a-kind.  Whether you are a biblical scholar or not, this story can resonate with any of the classic tales ever told.  It contains such seminal themes as betrayal, family dynamics, jealousy, repentance, and redemption.Overall, ""Joseph"" is just a really fun experience for all involved.

But this DVD has changed my view and I now believe a good musical can be as great on a small screen as on a big stage.It is simply amazing how Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber could transform Bible story into contemporary fable.  This production amazes me with its wonderful cast, great choreography, and excellent staging.  It is truly a dazzling production, fulfilling the satisfaction of your ears and eyes to the ultimate.  It certainly has its tricks to attract small kid's attention. My two little boys love it.  This is the only show, besides ""Power Ranger"" and ""SpongeBob"", which can make them sit through and watch it again and again.The music score is enchanting (like all Andrew Lloyd Webber music), especially versatile, and full of fun.  Donny Osmond is perfect for Joseph and delivers the best ""Close Every Door"" among all the other Joseph's.  Maria Friedman is very good as narrator.  Besides her unique voice, her acting is natural and just right for the role. The eleven jealous brothers' comical performance in country, French caf&eacute; music, and calypso are marvelous and couldn't be more entertaining.  They definitely add a yummy topping to the show.  Another masterstroke is the impersonation of pharaoh (King) with ""Elvis-the King"", which is absolutely brilliant and witty.My family has been enjoying this DVD since it arrived.
