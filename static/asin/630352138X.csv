The Nevil Shute novel, on which the screenplay was based, was written three years before that.  Is it just a coincidence that the airplane in the movie was called the Reindeer?  And the problem with the Comet was finally found by extended testing in a laboratory, just like Stewart's character was doing in the movie.  Oh, and while the windows were not implicated in the movie, they were square, just like in the Comet, where they were a factor.OK, besides the almost spooky coincidences, Nevil Shute's (On the Beach, A Town Like Alice) writing comes through and translates nicely to the screen.  Great casting.  I really liked Marlene Dietrich in this movie.  James Stewart is always good, and Glynis Johns is perfect as the flight attendant.  Henry Koster's (The Robe, Harvey, The Bishop's Wife) directing is as believable, smooth, and unobtrusive, as always.  The shooting locations, especially those outside, are just fun to see.  Pretty much everything about this movie works.

378776,A1FDW1SPYKB354,630352138X,David Von Pein,"[28, 28]","1951's ""No Highway In The Sky"" stars James Stewart as ""Theodore Honey"", a scientist working on an unusual project -- attempting to prove that a new fleet of commercial airplanes is about to experience a catastrophic failure of its tail assembly. Is Mr. Honey just a crackpot, as most people around him seem to think? Or is he on to something? Watch this excellent black-and-white drama and see for yourself.Jimmy Stewart is superb in his role here as a nervous and eccentric engineer/scientist. So what else is new, right? Jimmy's always great in my book. One of Stewart's co-stars in this movie is Marlene Dietrich. This, IMO, is kind of an odd part for Dietrich, and a rather small one. She's not really part of the main plot at all, and could have easily been written out of the script without much difficulty if needed. But I'm glad she wasn't. She makes the most of her small part here (as a compassionate movie star named ""Monica Teasdale""), who is flying on board the same airplane with Mr. Honey -- an airplane that Mr. Honey is convinced is going to break apart at any moment and plunge to a watery grave. Dietrich plays off of Stewart's foibles nicely in their scenes together.Glynis Johns also co-stars in ""No Highway"" (that shorter title was the original name of the film; the ""...In The Sky"" portion of the title was added for U.S. prints). Johns, like Dietrich, portrays a very sympathetic character in the picture, who is very tender and understanding toward Mr. Honey's fears and suspicions about the new ""Reindeer"" fleet of aircraft. Johns' character is a stewardess who befriends Stewart/Honey and his young daughter (who is played with feeling by 12-year-old Janette Scott).""No Highway In The Sky"" was directed by Henry Koster, who also directed James Stewart in ""Harvey"" just one year earlier.This VHS tape was issued by FOX Video in 1995 (under 20th Century Fox's ""Studio Classic"" banner), and sports a feature running time of 98 minutes.

He's reacting to a question from a new supervisor, who wants to know why he hasn't ""fast tracked"" his research, as airplanes, and people's lives might be at stake. I'm paraphrasing, so I might not have got the quotes exactly right, but the central idea is clear, and it is true. As usual, Jimmy Stewart nails his character, the completely pre-occupied professor, totally absorbed by his work, to the exclusion of people and events around him, including the house he lives in. At one point, he actually tries to enter the wrong house, and is so surprised at his mistake that he conspicuously checks the address on the house, to satisfy himself that it is, indeed, the wrong house.

This Einstein like quality is the first of ""Mr. Honey's"" quirky characteristics that will soon endear him to you - and his story will have you on the edge of your seat one moment and laughing the next.

Mr. Honey realizes midflight that he is sitting on the airplane which his research involves. Upon further inspection he discovers that the plane is flying under conditions which he believes will cause it to crash before the flight ends. Thus begins a war between the eccentric scientist with a theory and those around him who have to decide whether to believe him or not. It is in this turmoil - in Stewart's surety of their impending fate - that he strikes up a friendship with a glamorous filmstar, played by Marlene Dietrich, and the sweet and patient flight attendant, Glennis Johns.

Back then ( 50s/ 60s ) they would telecast old movies by playing the film with a television camera pointed at the screen.  Times have changed.  Way back then we could have our own copy.  That would come much later.Don't recall seeing it in the comments but the writer was an aeronautical engineer.  He wrote the book in '48. It was a success.  The movie , this movie, followed in '51.  It was a success.  Several years later the first commercial passenger jet, the British ""Comet"" began to crash for no apparent reason.  Turns out it was metal fatigue around the square windows.  Next time you get into a passenger jet look at the windows.  They are rounded because they have to be.  Shute did not predict the EXACT manner of metal fatigue failure but did predict it.  An amazing feat of engineering precognition.I never forgot this movie and it's moral. All my life, whenever I boarded a jet, I think of it.  Finally some years back I got the VHS.  I've watched it many times.  Then I got the book. Or, I should say, discovered that there even WAS a book.  If you like the movie you should read the book.  The movie follows it very very closely.  However, the book is more sterotyped, Mr. Honey AND his daughter are described as very ugly physically and there is a constant barrage of disparaging remarks about Mr. Honey, aka ""the little man"" or ""boffin"" whatever that means in British English.The book and movie are , of course, trite in many places as well as sexist but not overly so.  It was just the times.  Long time ago.I lament the unavailability of a DVD of this movie.  I'd buy a copy immediately.  I also own ""Strategic Air Command"".  It will scare the pants off you.  The fools. But, that's another story.  I'd buy it on DVD as well.I investigated the Amazon rental and digital purchase options.  I don't have a Tivo so would have to watch on PC.  I don't understand how the purchased version could be ""stored"" on portable devices.  I guess they mean hard drives?  I don't know if they've protected the purchased digital copy to prevent it's being put on a DVD.I like to own the actual movie or music on a physical storage media such as CD or DVD.  Your computer crashes...your DVR or whatever malfunctions and presto you no longer have a copy of what you bought and paid for.So, hey Amazon, listen up.....I KNOW you make a lot more money a lot faster selling mp3s and digital movies etc.  But.....I'm not going to buy any.Call it ""market resistance"" if you will.  With this movie it seems somebody has decided more $ can be made by keeping it out of DVD release.  It's ultimately about the money and making sure that each heir or stockholder gets their 1/100 of a cent royalty for each copy etc.The movie is great.

378802,A20SO3O9ODU8KF,630352138X,"Laurence G. Cripe ""ScriptMaverick""","[0, 0]","In what amounts to a riveting detective story, this pearl of a film appears to have been dwarfed by other 20th Century Fox releases of the time.  Without a doubt, the template of a young aeronautical engineer - specializing in metallurgic forensics - stumbling upon what could be proof of catastrophic structural fatigue that could result in the deaths of airline passengers was a clear ticket for American actor, Jimmy Stewart. Playing the introverted and absent-minded Theodore Honey, Stewart's character is trying to convince the hierarchy of the Royal Aircraft Establishment that their most recent entry into the civil passenger livery may be seriously flawed.  The four-engine, turbo-prop Reindeer passenger plane is prone to cataclysmic vibration harmonics in the tail empennage after approximately 1440 hours of flying time.  At least, this is what it appears to be on paper to Mr. Honey who is waiting on actual testing of the tail structure to bear his hypothesis out. In the meantime, the Reindeer fly.  One of the passenger planes has already crashed in Labrador and there may be evidence that it experienced a catastrophic tail separation before plummeting to the ground. The Director of the Establishment's Metallurgic Department, Sir John - played by Ronald Squire - insists that Mr. Honey be on the investigation team that goes to the crash site.  In the meantime, Sir John's understudy, Dennis Scott - played by Jack Hawkins - gets some unique insight into the rather odd, yet talented, Mr. Honey.  Honey, a Rhodes Scholar, is a widower with a young daughter, Elspeth - played with invigorating charm and youthful innocence by Janette Scott. Having lost his wife, Mary, during the war, Honey - among his many interests and endeavors, has struggled to raise a young 12 year old woman into the world, whose intellectual capacity and interests rival those of her father - yet, has had little exposure to a normal childhood. In a moment of discovery at Mr. Honey's tenement, Dennis Scott looks over the many stacked books in Honey's library and littered about the house.  A singular small book deals with raising a child, which speaks oceans about Honey's understanding of the subject - he mentions to Scott that he doesn't entirely agree with the book!Honey leaves England aboard a passenger plane that turns out to be one of the planes which he is investigating - a Reindeer.  We are introduced to a number of significant characters - a flight attendant, Marjorie Corder, ably and passionately played by Glynis Johns, and a sultry actress (""sultry"" being all too clich&eacute;), Monica Teasdale, played with the reverent precision of Marlene Dietrich.  Liall MacGinnis plays the pilot, Captain Samuelson, in an un-credited role.  Kenneth More, also in an un-credited role, plays the co-pilot, Dobson. The flight is key to the story - as Mr. Honey, identified as a company employee and prominent engineer, is given a brief courtesy tour of the aircraft and speaks with the flight engineer, garnering information that this particular Reindeer has accrued a little more than 1420 hours of flight time - closely approaching the window of vulnerability that Honey has predicted with this calculations - 1440 hours... Nervous to say the least, Honey asks to speak to the Captain and asks that he turn back now - indicating his professional understanding of the Reindeer design flaw.  Samuelson is skeptical, not having heard of any such problem through normal airline channels.  But, it appears that he can't entirely ignore this warning.  Honey explains that he is headed to Gander as part of an investigation team looking into the crash of a Reindeer wherein the tail section was not discovered with the bulk of the wreckage...suggesting that it separated before its fateful plunge.  When Samuelson suggests that they go back and look at the structure of the internal tail assembly  - looking for fissures or other signs of stress, Honey mentions, that this event will be all of a sudden...one moment the structure will be perfectly fine, then suddenly, the character of the metal will change - resulting in catastrophic separation...the plane will descend into the sea and they will all be killed.  Samuelson considers this and states that he will make a call to get advice and will shut down the inboard engines in order to minimize vibration.  From this, we gather that he is somewhat receptive as one would hope any human being responsible for the lives of others would be.  Flight attendant Corder and Actress Teasdale are deeply touched when Mr. Honey reveals to them just where in the aircraft they are most likely to survive the initial impact into the sea, should they experience the inevitable tail separation.  It appears that their safety is of paramount importance.The Reindeer uneventfully lands in Gander and within an instant, all of those who were convinced in Honey's vision of disaster, are simply relieved to be on the ground, and doubt that his prediction had any merit to begin with - but, the flight will soon resume on its second leg to Montreal.  Honey is treated with indignation and placed in flight attendant Corder's custody while the Captain asks for a thorough inspection of the Reindeer.  Both Corder and Teasdale are determined to resume with the continuing flight.  Honey is a man of conviction and is determined to see that this Reindeer can't continue.  SPOILER ALERT! To emphasize his determination to obtain the appropriate audience, Mr. Honey is able to make his way into the Reindeer cockpit and hits the landing gear retraction lever.  The Reindeer crumples to the tarmac - damaged and no longer air-worthy.  ""Now, I've done it!"", Honey exclaims...Back in England, Miss Teasdale and Miss Corder visit the Honey residence, sympathetically, to look after Elspeth while her father - whose fate is uncertain - undergoes grilling and psychiatric evaluation.  In the meantime, his experiment with the static vibration testing of an exemplar Reindeer tail-plane continues.  In the apex of suspense, Honey must attend a meeting of the Board of Directors who will consider his fate.  Miss Corder decides that she will marry Mr. Honey who, obviously, needs just a little help and guidance. The speech Mr. Honey makes in defense is actions in Gander is priceless with its Jimmy Stewart twang - reminiscent of his many fine performances where he stands up for himself.  While the testing of the Reindeer tail has exceeded his calculations in terms of time anticipated to fail, Mr. Honey resigns from the Establishment. A report reaches the Establishment that the repaired Reindeer from Gander experienced a catastrophic tail failure upon landing in England - just as Honey receives this message at his testing facility - his test bears out his theory -  This is an absorbing film with great acting and very good special effects for the time period.",5,People Die When Reindeer Fly,1379462400,"09 18,

378804,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,630352138X,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","*Minor Spoiler Warning*First off, this is an excellent film. Period. If the following gives any other impression - accept my apologies. I'm merely attempting to critique it, not downplay the fascinating story of a man who suspects something no one else does.In this production Jimmy plays Theodore Honey, a ""boffin"" studying an obscure problem with an aircraft design the company he works for has already put into production. His theoretical model show that vibrations over a specific amount of time, 1440 hours to be exact, will cause the tail portion of the aircraft to literally shake itself off. And through a series of freakish events, he's horrified to discover himself on an aircraft of that design - with 1422 hours on the airframe! What can he do? As he attempts to warn the flight crew and other passengers - will they believe him? And what will he do if they don't?My primary knock against the film is that Stewart doesn't quite transcend his own obvious personable qualities - you know it's Jimmy, the amiable aw-shucks actor. He lacks the requisite camouflage, of completely submerging himself and enveloping his character. Flatly, in this rare case, he doesn't totally present as an outcast bookworm, so the role plays as somewhat false. The film really takes off, so to speak, as Theodore begins to express his fears; first vigorously and then maniacally, taking the position that the aircraft is indeed defective to the point of being construed as a complete nutter.And even though Stewart isn't initially convincing, one can still see the thespian craft at work. So many movie stars of today - few are truly acting, most settle into careers of being themselves in differing situations. One scene in particular jumped out, near the beginning of the film, when Theodore is leaving the factory for home. Jimmy walks with a furtive shuffling gait, shoulders hunched, clutching his belongings in fear of losing them - clearly a man who has a limited ability to function outside of the laboratory - a true boffin. By the way, it's a word that I had to look up. It's a British euphemism for someone who is hyper-studious and socially inept, usually associated with a person deeply involved the hard sciences or rarified academia.Marlene portrays, of all things, a famous movie actress. Her character, Monica Teasdale, is intrigued and fascinated by the odd man she meets on an overseas flight to Quebec. As Theodore reaches out to the movie star, she sees in him a strength and conviction of purpose as he describes his profession and his mathematical fears. Not only because Theodore the man is interesting, but because his outrageous claim quite literally carries her life in the balance. But as he begins to assert himself, with her support and encouragement, she begins wonders if her trust is misplaced - that the funny man is more than just emotionally handicapped, but emotionally deranged.As the stage moves from the air to the ground, and an official board of inquiry, the climax proves to be a somewhat anticlimactic. The question of whether  Theodore Honey as a brilliant engineer who prophetically foresees disaster -or- a highly emotional and unstable researcher incapable of admitting his own shortcomings is sidestepped by having him walk out, declaring his intention to ""resign"" and setting up shop somewhere else to prove his theories - only to have the answer delivered via deus ex machina. An ending that I felt cheated us out of what could have been a sensational and dramatic conclusion.Again, I want to reiterate that I enjoyed the film. Just felt it missed the mark at something spectacular.Movie Notes:- Interestingly, veteran character actor Glynis Johns had a much larger role in the film; greater than the artwork to the movie suggests. Stewart and Dietrich are of course the stars. However, it's her character Marjorie, that turns out to be the romantic interest in the film; the sweet accommodating airline stewardess whose growing fondness for the quirky scientist and his obsession quietly turns into love.It's a deeply touching scene as Dietrich's world-reknown actress kindly and wisely steps aside for her rival, whom she recognizes as a better match. A poignant and very sad moment that Marlene plays to absolute perfection - as if there were any doubt about that.- By only two years, this film frighteningly predates the real-life tragedy of the British De Havilland Comet - the world's very first commercial jet-powered airliner. A design flaw in the shape and installation of the passenger windows was discovered only after production; extreme changes in temperature and pressure during high altitude flights exposed a weakness in the airframe. The flaw caused several terrible crashes and many deaths, virtually wiping out the domestic UK aircraft industry, which was at the time on the cusp of global domination. The Comet disasters allowed the US-based Boeing Company to rise to worldwide dominance. A dominance that wouldn't be challenged for nearly half a century.",4,"Excellent, Just Missing The Mark At Spectacular",1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,5017,"['*Minor', 'Spoiler', 'Warning*First', 'off',

378821,A2TBN90L5KP085,630352138X,Steven Zoraster,"[46, 47]","This is a faithful film adaptation of a very good Nevil Shute novel.  (Mr. Shute was the author of &quot;On the Beach&quot; and &quot;A Town Like Alice,&quot; among other fine books.)  This is a story of good people,  simply trying to live their lives and often finding sanity and - dare I say  it? - salvation through hard work, a recurring theme in Mr. Shute's  writings.  The central character is Theodore Honey, a boffin at the Royal  Aircraft Establishment research facility shortly after World War II  investigating the rather peculiar  - for the time - theory that metal  fatigue might cause catastrophic failure in aircraft structures during  flight.Stewart's Honey is certainly a boffin, in the traditional British  sense.  A brilliant but introverted scientist,  almost completely wrapped  up in his work.  His only real contact with society is through his  daughter, who he is raising alone since his wife was killed by a German  bomb during World War II.  The rest of society is a complete puzzlement to  Honey, as is Honey to the rest of society.  He is only just barely  intelligible to the scientific types he works with.  Stewart plays the  bumbling Honey to the hilt, with a messy house and few social graces. His  daughter is much loved, but the audience can see she is starving for more  from life than Honey can even imagine her needing. Stewart - and I am not a  Stewart fan - makes Honey both believable and likeable, and even  potentially lovable. (Part of his success is due to the fact that Honey's  foibles as shown in the movie really are funny without being insulting to  the character.)So where does the story line come in?  Well, Honey's  ideas about metal fatigue is actually very important, because he is testing  them on the tail section of a new British airliner, the Reindeer, which is  already in service flying between Britain and North America.  According to  Honey's calculations, tail assemblies are going to start falling off these  planes after about 1400 hours of flight time.  Luckily, the planes are so  new in service that this deadline does not appear to be an immediate  problem.  Except, not so luckily, a few of the early production models used  for testing are approaching the fateful 1400 hour limit, and one has  already passed that limit and crashed in Canada, with the cause of the  crash attributed to &quot;pilot error.&quot;Quite reasonably, Honey is  sent across the Atlantic to investigate the Canadian crash. It turns out  that he flies off in - what else? - a Reindeer.  A Reindeer which he  discovers after take off has over 1400 hours of airtime.  Suddenly Honey  the boffin is thrust into the real world with a vengeance.  His attempts to  warn the flight crew of the potential danger fail, and his introverted  personality encourages him to withdraw from the fight.  Yet at the same  time his basic humanity draws him to warn and to try saving both a famous  movie actress on the same flight, well played by Marlene Dietrich, and a  caring stewardess played by Glynis Johns. Honey's honest attraction to  these very different people forces him out of his scientific shell to take  drastic action to save them and the other passengers and crew.Within  the story, we see character exposition and character development not only  from Honey, but also by Dietrich and Jones. These later developments are  both touching and fully believable.  Especially poignant is Dietrich's  character, who is drawn to Honey's honesty and commitment, but is literally  beaten to the door by the stewardess played by Jones.  The Dietrich  character's sadness at what she believes is her own rather pointless  celluloid life, and her sorrow at losing Honey are truly moving.Strong  supporting roles are provided by Jack Hawkins (last seen helping to blow up  that Damn bridge on over the River Kwai) and several other fine actors,  especially the young Janette Scott who plays Honey's 12 year old daughter  Elspeth.  Scott's role as a young girl who loves and worships her father,  and yet is paying a price for her constrained family life she can not even  understand is beautifully done.  (One of the best scenes of the movie is  where Dietrich's character, about to leave the world of the Honey's for  good, asks the stewardess, who is there to stay, to &quot;tell [Elspeth]  that she is pretty.&quot;)I know it may seem that I have given a lot  away in this review.  But be assured, there is a lot more to this movie  that I haven't even touched on. For just one example, where else are you  going to see real flight footage of the Meteor, the first British jet  fighter?  And for another example, just how Honey finally manages to save  the lives of everyone on that apparently doomed Reindeer is fun, exciting,  and empowering, to Honey and to other characters as well.Anyway, If  you like people, you will like this movie.",5,"If you like people, you will like this movie",958608000,"05 18, 2000",2000,4873,"['faithful', 'film', 'adaptation', 'very', 'good',

While on a flight to investigate a plane crash that may prove his theory, he discovers that the very plane he's on is about to reach those hours over the ocean. This intelligent ""disaster"" film has an American star (Stewart) and an American director, Henry Koster (THE ROBE) but is a British film in every other sense. The film is very well constructed, making its possibly dubious plot entirely believable. The film is helped by Stewart's excellent, intense performance. Based on the novel by Nevil Shute (ON THE BEACH). With Marlene Dietrich as the glamorous film star and fellow passenger on Stewart's doomed plane, Glynis Johns as the flight attendant who falls in love with. The effective uncredited score is by Malcolm Arnold. Also with Jack Hawkins, Kenneth More, Janette Scott, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Elizabeth Allan, Niall MacGinnis and Maurice Denham.The DVD from KSM Klassiker in Germany is a pristine transfer in its appropriate 1.33 aspect ratio.
