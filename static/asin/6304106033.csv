401230,A1HSV1FNVPNR4H,6304106033,"Accent Marketing Group ""http://InsiderSecrets...","[1, 1]","I just discovered this film due to Downey becoming such a popular actor. Adapting a long novel to the screen is never easy, and so while there are some clunky bits and howlers in terms of continuity in this film, it rises above the ordinary costume drama thanks to its humor and humanity.Downey is a comic genius, with every gesture contributing to his 'lovable fool' Merivel, who becomes an heroic figure due to the role history thrusts upon him. All of the cast support him as he takes center stage in a humble way, the chemistry between him and Neill as the King, and with Thewlis as his best friend John is brilliant.The Polly Walker sections were very good, the costumes amazing. The Meg Ryan sections were rather contrived, but again, Downey's performance of such sincerity carries it through.The ending is total Hollywood, but perfect for the film as a whole, and its constant play upon light and dark. So while it is not faithful to the book, it is faithful to its own rendering of it.The costumes, settings, wonderful locales like Forde Abbey, Brympton D'Evercy, (I read all the credits!) and Blenheim Palace, make this not a perfect movie, but certainly what period movies should be.Ian McKellan as Will, his loyal servant, and Hugh Grant as the treacherous painter Finn, and the dozen or so Cavalier King Charles spaniels, make this a charming and moving film about one man's redemption and restoration.",4,"A gorgeous movie, great Downey",1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,1414,"['just', 'discovered', 'film', 'due', 'Downey', 'becoming', 'such', 'popular', 'actor', 'Adapting', 'long', 'novel', 'screen', 'never', 'easy', 'so', 'are', 'clunky', 'bits', 'howlers', 'terms', 'continuity', 'film', 'ordinary', 'costume', 'drama', 'thanks', 'humor', 'humanity.Downey', 'comic', 'genius', 'gesture', 'contributing', ""'lovable"", 'fool', 'Merivel', 'who', 'heroic', 'figure', 'due', 'role', 'history', 'thrusts', 'cast', 'support', 'center', 'stage', 'humble', 'way', 'chemistry', 'Neill', 'King', 'Thewlis', 'best', 'friend', 'John', 'brilliant.The', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'sections', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'costumes', 'amazing', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'sections', 'were', 'rather', 'contrived', 'again', 'Downey', 'performance', 'such', 'sincerity', 'through.The', 'ending', 'total', 'Hollywood', 'perfect', 'film', 'whole', 'constant', 'play', 'light', 'dark', 'So', 'not', 'faithful', 'book', 'faithful', 'own', 'rendering', 'it.The', 'costumes', 'settings', 'wonderful', 'locales', 'Forde', 'Abbey', 'Brympton', ""D'Evercy"", 'read', 'credits', 'Blenheim', 'Palace', 'make', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'certainly', 'what', 'period', 'movies', 'should', 'be.Ian', 'McKellan', 'Will', 'loyal', 'servant', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'treacherous', 'painter', 'Finn', 'dozen', 'so', 'Cavalier', 'King', 'Charles', 'spaniels', 'make', 'charming', 'moving', 'film', 'one', 'man', 'redemption', 'restoration']",Restoration VHS

401237,A3N94LNED0IF0R,6304106033,Charles S. Tashiro,"[8, 14]","RESTORATION is an excellent example of what happens when artists suppress what gives them and us pleasure in order to make us better human beings.As long as it stays at the court of Charles II (Sam Neill, one of the most wasted actors of the past twenty years, here at his sly best), RESTORATION is a luscious romp, as rich and delectable as a fully ripe peach. You can practically hear the filmmakers giggling in pleasure at the sumptuous period spread they've given us. Designed and photographed superbly, these sequences amply suggest why England welcomed the libertine Charles back to the throne after Cromwell's grimly Puritanical interregnum. Even the scenes in the slums of London have an atavistically sensuous appeal, as if the very dirt, blood and garbage were alive with erotic potential.Alas, 17th Century England may have had enough of the Puritans, but filmmakers are never allowed to suggest that sensual pleasure may be enough on its own. It always has to be justified with a ""deeper"" message. Sure enough, after the fun comes the good doctor's ""salvation"" in a solemn, sanctimonious parable of redemption through suffering. (With Robert Downey in the part, it's hard not to view the doctor's excesses in light of the actor's own difficulties with drugs and alcohol, but do we really have to go to his AA meetings with him?) You can't say the film is exactly hypocritical for indulging us one minute, then preaching the next. There's not enough conviction in these dim scenes to suggest the filmmakers really care about virtue. It's obvious they're longing to sneak back to court.The problem is, convictionless or not, the scenes are still heavy-going, humorless slogs through a set of moral clich&eacute;s calculated to prove, once again, that those who enjoy themselves too much are bound to pay for it one way or another and can only achieve their true humanity by finding love for another. Yawn. Thank goodness the King conveniently turns up at the end to make the doctor's life fun again. It's wonderful how filmmakers always manage to let us have our cake and eat it too. So the real lesson you are likely to take away from RESTORATION is that if you're going to have fun, make sure Daddy's around to bail you out when you get into trouble. That may be a more truthful observation about our contradictory attitudes toward pleasure than anybody realized.",2,"I'll stay at Court, thank you",970012800,"09 27, 2000",2000,2375,"['RESTORATION', 'excellent', 'example', 'what', 'when', 'artists', 'suppress', 'what', 'pleasure', 'order', 'make', 'better', 'human', 'beings.As', 'long', 'court', 'Charles', 'II', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'one', 'most', 'wasted', 'actors', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'here', 'sly', 'best', 'RESTORATION', 'luscious', 'romp', 'rich', 'delectable', 'fully', 'ripe', 'peach', 'can', 'practically', 'hear', 'filmmakers', 'giggling', 'pleasure', 'sumptuous', 'period', 'spread', ""'ve"", 'given', 'Designed', 'photographed', 'superbly', 'sequences', 'amply', 'suggest', 'why', 'England', 'welcomed', 'libertine', 'Charles', 'back', 'throne', 'Cromwell', 'grimly', 'Puritanical', 'interregnum', 'Even', 'scenes', 'slums', 'London', 'have', 'atavistically', 'sensuous', 'appeal', 'very', 'dirt', 'blood', 'garbage', 'were', 'alive', 'erotic', 'potential.Alas', '17th', 'Century', 'England', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'enough', 'Puritans', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'never', 'allowed', 'suggest', 'sensual', 'pleasure', 'may', 'be', 'enough', 'own', 'always', 'be', 'justified', 'deeper', 'message', 'Sure', 'enough', 'fun', 'good', 'doctor', 'salvation', 'solemn', 'sanctimonious', 'parable', 'redemption', 'suffering', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'part', 'hard', 'not', 'view', 'doctor', 'excesses', 'light', 'actor', 'own', 'difficulties', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'do', 'really', 'have', 'go', 'AA', 'meetings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'exactly', 'hypocritical', 'indulging', 'one', 'minute', 'then', 'preaching', 'next', 'not', 'enough', 'conviction', 'dim', 'scenes', 'suggest', 'filmmakers', 'really', 'care', 'virtue', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'longing', 'sneak', 'back', 'court.The', 'problem', 'convictionless', 'not', 'scenes', 'are', 'still', 'heavy-going', 'humorless', 'slogs', 'set', 'moral', 'clich', 'eacute', 'calculated', 'prove', 'once', 'again', 'who', 'enjoy', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'bound', 'pay', 'one', 'way', 'can', 'only', 'achieve', 'true', 'humanity', 'finding', 'love', 'Yawn', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'King', 'conveniently', 'up', 'end', 'make', 'doctor', 'life', 'fun', 'again', 'wonderful', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'always', 'manage', 'let', 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'real', 'lesson', 'are', 'likely', 'take', 'away', 'RESTORATION', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'fun', 'make', 'sure', 'Daddy', 'bail', 'out', 'when', 'get', 'trouble', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'truthful', 'observation', 'contradictory', 'attitudes', 'pleasure', 'anybody', 'realized']",Restoration VHS
401238,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,6304106033,Dai-keag-ity,"[4, 4]","When the dictatorial regicide and would-be genocidal warlord Oliver Cromwell breathed his Puritanical last and took his place next to Judas in wastelands of Hell (sorry, I'm just being Irish, folks) a new and glorious era dawned in England, and this time, the 1660's, came to be known as the Restoration. Telling a story set in England during this age, director Michael Hoffman gives us an unflinching view of the grit and grime of the seventeenth-century, even as he deliberately contrasts it with the French-influenced grandeurs of the Royal Court. Sam Neill steals the show in my opinion and nails dead-on the personality of the complex King Charles II, once a futureless exile during the Commonwealth, now an all-powerful monarch intent on solidifying his place in history. Also for all his reputed drug use, Robert Downey Jr's acting skills are as good here as they were in Chaplain. Downey plays physician Robert Merivel, a carousing womanizer whose incipient talents in medicine are smothered by his desires for fleshly pleasures, and we see him first rise under the patronage of King Charles (as he receives credit for saving the life of a royal mistress' pet dog)  and later witness his downfall from the easy hedonism of the Court. Merivel rues his banishment and finds a place amid the lowest of the low, eventually fathering a child with a half-mad Irishwoman played by Meg Ryan. When Merivel demonstrates selfless courage during a time of national crisis, he again comes to the notice of the pragmatic and shrewd king, and before film's end he, too, is ""restored"" in fortune and arises a new and far better man for the tortuous journey through which his life has taken him.",4,The Fall And Rise Of One Man Amid The Splendor Of The Stuart Court And The Muck Of The Outer World,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,1686,"['When', 'dictatorial', 'regicide', 'would-be', 'genocidal', 'warlord', 'Oliver', 'Cromwell', 'breathed', 'Puritanical', 'last', 'took', 'place', 'Judas', 'wastelands', 'Hell', 'sorry', ""'m"", 'just', 'being', 'Irish', 'folks', 'new', 'glorious', 'era', 'dawned', 'England', 'time', '1660', 'came', 'be', 'known', 'Restoration', 'Telling', 'story', 'set', 'England', 'age', 'director', 'Michael', 'Hoffman', 'unflinching', 'view', 'grit', 'grime', 'seventeenth-century', 'even', 'deliberately', 'French-influenced', 'grandeurs', 'Royal', 'Court', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'show', 'opinion', 'nails', 'dead-on', 'personality', 'complex', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'once', 'futureless', 'exile', 'Commonwealth', 'now', 'all-powerful', 'monarch', 'intent', 'solidifying', 'place', 'history', 'Also', 'reputed', 'drug', 'use', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'good', 'here', 'were', 'Chaplain', 'Downey', 'physician', 'Robert', 'Merivel', 'carousing', 'womanizer', 'incipient', 'talents', 'medicine', 'are', 'smothered', 'desires', 'fleshly', 'pleasures', 'see', 'first', 'rise', 'patronage', 'King', 'Charles', 'credit', 'saving', 'life', 'royal', 'mistress', 'pet', 'dog', 'later', 'witness', 'downfall', 'easy', 'hedonism', 'Court', 'Merivel', 'banishment', 'place', 'lowest', 'low', 'eventually', 'fathering', 'child', 'half-mad', 'Irishwoman', 'played', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'When', 'Merivel', 'selfless', 'courage', 'time', 'national', 'crisis', 'again', 'notice', 'pragmatic', 'shrewd', 'king', 'film', 'end', 'too', 'restored', 'fortune', 'new', 'far', 'better', 'man', 'tortuous', 'journey', 'life', 'taken']",Restoration VHS

At first this movie seems like it will be a raunchy, drunken, orgy film with the main character, Robert Merivel, gaining acceptance into the royal household of King Charles II of England.  A physician, he saves the king's dog then becomes a drunken boor at court.Chalres uses Robert for a dupe then Robert is cast out of court when he defies the king's wish.  He ends up doctoring lunatics.  It is at this point where the film takes on life.  Eventually Robert's companion gives birth to a daughter then dies.  Robert takes the daughter to London where the plague is ravaging.  Then the fire of London happens.  In the end, Robert is restored to some of his former acceptance at the court of the king again.This film is a decent portrayal of restroation England, though this should not be confused with the film's title.

I was wrong.  This film was excellent.  Robert Downey Jr. as the central character was a bit over the top campy at times, but it worked for this piece.  He plays a self indulgent physician whose introduction to the viewer comes as he whines about having to treat sick people and has sold his instruments into pawn and is begging his father for the money to get them back.  Downey does a fine job as the over indulgent young man who is made a fool by the King and must learn the lessons that his friend, a simple Quaker physician (played surprisingly well by David Thewlis, who himself is normally the nail in the coffin for any movie hoping to be remotely good)and a mad woman (Meg Ryan).  It is the performances of the actors and the over all beauty of the film that makes it stand out as exceptional.  Sam Neil was delightfully wicked as King Charles II, Meg Ryan was hauntingly memorable as the mad woman whose tragic life is healed by Downey's physician and who teaches him about love, and though it pains one to say it, by David Thewlis whose portrayal of Dr. John Pierce not only makes Downey's transformation into a compassionate human being believable but also is surprisingly good in and of itself.

The main character, a playboy doctor named Merivel (Robert Downey) finds his redemption and his true purpose in life attending to plague victims and restoring to sanity a young abandoned wife (Meg Ryan), who bears him a child and gives him hope for a better future.  I'm not sure Downey was the ideal choice for the lead, and I'm certainly no fan of Meg Ryan (her Irish accent is ""variable,"" to say the least), but the supporting players are all in fine form, especially David Thewlis as Pearce, Merivel's best friend (and conscience) and Ian McDiarmid (yeah, the emperor from Star Wars) as the compassionate head of an insane asylum.  Sam Neill, always a fine actor, is perfect as the decadent king Charles II, a degenerate who nonetheless possesses a tad of compassion.  There are a few flaws - for example, during the Great Fire, Merivel lies unconscious on a boat in the Thames River and somehow the boat ends up in Suffolk - a geographical impossibility.

Occuring during the English Restoration period, it is also the story of a soul's restoration to recognize one's talents and one's destiny.  Based on the novel by Rose Tremain, it cuts across the events of the era using the life of the character Robert Merivel, played by Robert Downey, Jr.  The beauty of the costumes and art direction was accomplished within a miniscule budget (the total film budget was less than $20 million) but resulted in winning the Oscar for both categories.  As always, Mr. Downey Jr. proves that he is one of the top actors in America today.  It is a pity that his personal life has been so tragic and yet, here within this film, he portrays an individual bent on self-destruction rather than recognizing and exercising his talents.  You want to shout, ""Robert, do you watch any of your films?""  It is funny, touching and inspiring.  Sadly, not a box office smash, but it was a difficult movie to promote.  Also, pay attention to the film score, a great combination of classical music of the period and an excellent score by James Newton Howard.

The King has ordered that Merivel marry the Royal Mistress,in order to appease and avoid scandal,but that Merivel is to NOT fall in love with The Lady Celia!Merivel does,though.He cannot help it.The King banishes Merivel,losing all only to now return to Pearce and resume medicine.There Merivel encounters madness and disease of all sorts and sets about to bring his medical knowledge to these patients.One is Catherine (Meg Ryan) whom Merivel acutely realizes has been damaged by past experiences and is not mad as suspected.They become intimate and she eventually bears his child, only to die in childbirth.Distraught,Merivel takes his young daughter and flees to London only to find that the Plague is consuming the city and that Celia is sick.Posing as Pearce,who has since died,Merivel is summoned to the Palace and diagnoses the sick Celia as needing love and understanding from the King (a marvelous Sam Neill).The London fire then strikes the City and Merivel tries to find his infant daughter.He is cast adrift out of the city,but in the end his daughter is returned, the King's favour is restored and Merivel has learned the lessons of compassion and true love.All is restored!!!.....WHEW!....AND I LEFT OUT A LOT!!!! Now,could you follow that??? That now is the one rub with this film;the book is all there and it is crammed into 2 hours! It doesn't work.Knowing Tremain's book helps immensely with filling in what either the director,script super or editor left out!

Bernabo,"[74, 78]","""Restoration"" won a pair of Oscars for Eugenio Zanetti's Art Direction-Set Deocration and James Acheson's Costume Design, and there is a sense in which the spectacular sets threaten to overwhelm the story, which is based on the novel by Rose Tremain.  This is a gorgeous film where the camera often takes time to focus on every detail as we are introduced to one spectacular set after another that presents the lavish court of King Charles II, who returned to the English throne following the restoration of the Stuart monarch.  As far as period costume dramas go this 1994 film is virtually in a class by itself, and how it was made for only $18 million is beyond belief.The reason that many viewers may not cotton to this film is that it is one in which we are repeatedly misled as to what the film is above.  Even with the hint of the film's title, which is at face value the term used to describe the reign of Charles II, ""Restoration"" makes more sense retrospectively.  However, I liked the idea that my idea of what the film was about kept evolving.  After all the times I have sat through predictable films and been ahead of the characters and the plot, I can certainly enjoy trying to keep up with a story for once and being surprised by the twists and turns in the narrative.The story is about Robert Merivel (Robert Downey Jr.), a young physician of great promise who is summoned to court to attend to a patient at the command of the King (Sam Neill).  Merivel succeeds, albeit more through luck than skill, and is appointed to a position in court.  Seduced by life in the palace Merivel accepts the position, which means turning his back on his studies and his best friend John Pearce (David Thewlis), a Quaker.  However, the King finds another use for Merivel and marries him to his most spirited mistress, Lady Cedlia (Polly Walker).  After the lavish wedding Merivel gets a knighthood and a huge country estate, but the one thing that is denied him is sex with his ""wife.""  Having been ordered not to fall in love with Celia, we believe we know what this film is going to be about.  However, in that regard we are both right and wrong.Despite the glamour of Merivel's rise in the first part of this film, it is his fall that produces the true drama.  It is a long fall, hard fall, set against the backdrop of two cataclysmic events in the London of that time: the Black Plague and the Great Fire.  It is not that Merivel finds himself during these trying times, but rather than he remembers himself.  Downey's performance covers a lot of ground.  When he is the fool he embraces the role wholeheartedly, but at the end when he has restored to him the most precious thing that he has lost the look on his face is a moment of transcendent joy.  Of course, it is impossible to watch this film today and not wish the actor had taken its moral to heart.I have enjoyed watching this film several times and one of these days I am going to have to read Tremain's novel.  I suspect that the screenplay by Rupert Walters is being extremely faithful, but I would also think that Tremain has all sorts of marvelous period details that I would enjoy.  Another thing that impresses me about Michael Hoffman's film is that it has Ian McKellen and Meg Ryan in what are essentially small, but pivotal, roles.  ""Restoration"" is a film where you just go along for the ride, enjoy the pretty pictures, and be surprised at the end to discover how far you have come from where you started.",5,"The rise, fall & restoration of the physician Robert Merivel",1082505600,"04 21, 2004",2004,3481,"['Restoration', 'won', 'pair', 'Oscars', 'Eugenio', 'Zanetti', 'Art', 'Direction-Set', 'Deocration', 'James', 'Acheson', 'Costume', 'Design', 'sense', 'spectacular', 'sets', 'threaten', 'overwhelm', 'story', 'based', 'novel', 'Rose', 'Tremain', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'where', 'camera', 'often', 'time', 'focus', 'detail', 'are', 'introduced', 'one', 'spectacular', 'set', 'lavish', 'court', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'who', 'returned', 'English', 'throne', 'following', 'restoration', 'Stuart', 'monarch', 'As', 'far', 'period', 'costume', 'dramas', 'go', '1994', 'film', 'virtually', 'class', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'only', '18', 'million', 'belief.The', 'reason', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'cotton', 'film', 'one', 'are', 'repeatedly', 'misled', 'what', 'film', 'Even', 'hint', 'film', 'title', 'face', 'value', 'term', 'used', 'describe', 'reign', 'Charles', 'II', 'Restoration', 'more', 'sense', 'retrospectively', 'However', 'liked', 'idea', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'about', 'kept', 'evolving', 'times', 'have', 'sat', 'predictable', 'films', 'been', 'ahead', 'characters', 'plot', 'can', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'story', 'once', 'being', 'surprised', 'twists', 'turns', 'narrative.The', 'story', 'Robert', 'Merivel', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'young', 'physician', 'great', 'promise', 'who', 'summoned', 'court', 'attend', 'patient', 'command', 'King', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Merivel', 'albeit', 'more', 'luck', 'skill', 'appointed', 'position', 'court', 'Seduced', 'life', 'palace', 'Merivel', 'position', 'turning', 'back', 'studies', 'best', 'friend', 'John', 'Pearce', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'Quaker', 'However', 'King', 'use', 'Merivel', 'marries', 'most', 'spirited', 'mistress', 'Lady', 'Cedlia', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'lavish', 'wedding', 'Merivel', 'knighthood', 'huge', 'country', 'estate', 'one', 'thing', 'denied', 'sex', 'wife', 'Having', 'been', 'ordered', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'Celia', 'believe', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'about', 'However', 'regard', 'are', 'right', 'wrong.Despite', 'glamour', 'Merivel', 'rise', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'fall', 'true', 'drama', 'long', 'fall', 'hard', 'fall', 'set', 'backdrop', 'two', 'cataclysmic', 'events', 'London', 'time', 'Black', 'Plague', 'Great', 'Fire', 'not', 'Merivel', 'trying', 'times', 'rather', 'Downey', 'performance', 'lot', 'ground', 'When', 'fool', 'role', 'wholeheartedly', 'end', 'when', 'restored', 'most', 'precious', 'thing', 'lost', 'look', 'face', 'moment', 'transcendent', 'joy', 'course', 'impossible', 'watch', 'film', 'today', 'not', 'wish', 'actor', 'had', 'taken', 'moral', 'heart.I', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'one', 'days', 'am', 'going', 'have', 'read', 'Tremain', 'novel', 'suspect', 'screenplay', 'Rupert', 'Walters', 'being', 'extremely', 'faithful', 'would', 'also', 'think', 'Tremain', 'sorts', 'marvelous', 'period', 'details', 'would', 'enjoy', 'thing', 'Michael', 'Hoffman', 'film', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'what', 'are', 'essentially', 'small', 'pivotal', 'roles', 'Restoration', 'film', 'where', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'enjoy', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'be', 'surprised', 'end', 'discover', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'come', 'where', 'started']",Restoration VHS

Consider if you will , for example, with more cause than any nation in the history of the world to have our kings declared Emperors, we never did...well the very idea, that was always something foreigners went in for at every opportunity.

401267,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,6304106033,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[10, 11]","Director Michael Hoffman's 1994 film ""Restoration"" was based on Rose Tremain's novel about 17th century England in the time known as ""The Restoration"" during the reign of King Charles II. A gorgeous film, it explores the times and its light and dark elements while at the same time we journey through the eventful life of the physician Dr. Robert Merivel (played by Robert Downey Jr). Through the course of the film, he encounters two women- the mysterious, beautiful and aristocratic Lady Celia Clemence (Polly Walker) and the simple, Irish Puritan played by Meg Ryan who hardly takes up roles in historic films. Guest stars include Ian McKellen (Gandal from Lord of the Rings)as a member of the king's court and Hugh Grant as an annoying, self-deluded portrait artist.The title suggests not only the period in England's history but the spiritual ""restoration"" of Robert himself, who goes through enormous change throughout the film, from womanizing, sinful, care-free, naive, immature young doctor to enlightened, wise, mature, compassionate and religiously guided family man. Merivel is a doctor during the Plague- not the Bubonic Plague of Shakespeare's day but the later plague of the mid 1600's. Science is illuminating the otherwise dark, superstitious medieval world as a type of Renaissance emergences in all the fields. Charles II (played by Sam Neill) has restored England and freed the country from the conservative, repressed and bleak reign of the Puritans, opening the theatres again (which the Puritans had found sinful)and opening his mind to the wonders of science. In one scene, an elderly guinea pig has been cut to reveal his living heart which he tells Merivel he can touch for a shilling. The role of Charles II is performed effortlessy by Sam Neill who makes him appear like England's version of Frances' Louis XIV the ""Sun King"". He offers Lady Celia (who enters in a magnificent display) as Merivel's bride but in one condition: he must never fall in love or have sexual relations with her. However, the promise is broken when Merviel and Celia do break the rules. Lady Celia, one of many mistresses of the polyamorous English king, is jealous and tormented that she is not the only one who owns the king's heart. I thought her character was rather wooden in this respect and she could have at least shown more strength of character rather than pining away for that lusty king. In contrant, Meg Ryan is simple, unassuming, spiritually motivated and ultimately happier though she lives in sheer poverty and plague.This is another little twist to the story. The poor seem to be better people than the rich. John Pearce, a Quaker, is the opposite of Charles II as he seems to be the power figure in a religious world of humanity and simplicity rather than luxury and pursuit of pleasure. This is a gorgeous film, with beautiful detail and attention to historic fact as well as a moving journey in the life of one man. Robert Downey Jr. himself incorporates the modern Merivel, as he has himself indulged in pleasures- and in life-afflicting drugs of which he has since recovered. Now, Downey is a better man, a changed man, much like Merivel in the end of the film. This is a great movie to look at, if only for its visual cinematography. There is subtle symbolism in the film, such as the tree in the Puritan settlement which seems to have mystic connections, the London Fire seems to be speaking of Hell Fire, the Universe ""Model"" with the King in the center seems to be saying that Charles II's reign was absolute.

This is where we are introduced to the young and brilliant Robert Merivel (Robert Downey, Jr.) along with his fellow physician, John Pierce.While Pierce is a Quaker and quite serious, his friend Merivel is daring and a bit hedonistic, although extremely full of passion for the human condition.  He is desperate to experience the joy in life and cannot find a balance in the London College of Medicine.  He may be dedicated to medicine although just as dedicated to himself at the start of this beautiful period piece, set in the age of Restoration.  While this is the climate for the movie, the 'Restoration' is more about Robert Merivel.King Charles II, learning of his insightful methods, appoints him to be his court physician.  While Merivel is rather bored and looking for some amusement in his own life, court life is exactly what the doctor ordered. He pleases the King and is knighted quickly only to learn that the reason why is to remove one of the King's mistresses, in wedlock, to his newly obtained estate away from court.There is a condition based on this marriage and that is the ribald doctor is not to touch the King's mistress, Lady Celia.  I would be remiss not to mention the wonderful actor Ian McKellen stars as the overseer of his newly acquired estate and that the King commissions his portrait artist (Hugh Grant) for a deviously comical situation.This beautifully directed movie by Michael Hoffman, displays more like a two act saga.  The above showing the gorgeous sets and costumery of the age along with all the legendary court decadence and debauchery.  Also, dark shadowed reports of the Plague are nearing London and leaving the people terrified and in desperate need of preparation.As we leave this more affluent side of the Merivel tale, we find him penniless and in need of his old trusted friend John Pierce.  He is practicing medicine along with other familial Quakers in a small communal type setting.  They are dealing with the 'mad' people in society where they are living their lives together.  Pierce and Merivel are overjoyed to be reunited with each other and also with the opportunity to be practicing together again.  His passion for the joy in life cannot be quenched, even in the most dismal and depressing of situations. He brings new and lively techniques into the treatment of the patients and new life to one Katherine (Meg Ryan) who is plagued with insomnia.The lovely Irish Katherine walks day and night around the tree in the courtyard practicing her ""leaving step"", while Merivel becomes more and more beguiled by her.  Always contemplating what is madness and what is only the ""need of relief from despair"".  During this time Katherine and Merivel begin meeting every night in secret, while Pierce becomes gravely ill.  He is deeply saddened by his longtime friend's sickness and does not leave his side trying to comfort him. They talk over all the different reasons why Pierce believes that Merivel needs to perfect his brilliant doctoral ways.As actions lead to consequences, Merivel and Katherine are asked to leave together from the hospital to begin a new life in another place.  They end up taking residence back where he started from in London.  The Plague has broken out and the people there are dying in droves.  Merivel is dealing with a pregnant Katherine and also his restored passion for the care of others.As the story draws it's conclusion later, we find that during the age of Restoration, Robert Merivel has been restored with his own passion for life and for the lives of others, through everything he suffers and everything he gains.",5,Restoration Has A Heart At It's Core.,1323734400,"12 13, 2011",2011,3731,"['opulence', 'English', 'Court', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'foreboding', 'dreary', 'London', '1663', 'where', 'are', 'introduced', 'young', 'brilliant', 'Robert', 'Merivel', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'fellow', 'physician', 'John', 'Pierce.While', 'Pierce', 'Quaker', 'quite', 'serious', 'friend', 'Merivel', 'daring', 'bit', 'hedonistic', 'extremely', 'full', 'passion', 'human', 'condition', 'desperate', 'experience', 'joy', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'balance', 'London', 'College', 'Medicine', 'may', 'be', 'dedicated', 'medicine', 'just', 'dedicated', 'start', 'beautiful', 'period', 'piece', 'set', 'age', 'Restoration', 'climate', 'movie', ""'Restoration"", 'more', 'Robert', 'Merivel.King', 'Charles', 'II', 'learning', 'insightful', 'methods', 'appoints', 'be', 'court', 'physician', 'Merivel', 'rather', 'bored', 'looking', 'amusement', 'own', 'life', 'court', 'life', 'exactly', 'what', 'doctor', 'ordered', 'King', 'knighted', 'quickly', 'only', 'learn', 'reason', 'why', 'remove', 'one', 'King', 'mistresses', 'wedlock', 'newly', 'obtained', 'estate', 'away', 'court.There', 'condition', 'based', 'marriage', 'ribald', 'doctor', 'not', 'touch', 'King', 'mistress', 'Lady', 'Celia', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'not', 'mention', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'overseer', 'newly', 'acquired', 'estate', 'King', 'commissions', 'portrait', 'artist', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'deviously', 'comical', 'situation.This', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Hoffman', 'more', 'two', 'act', 'saga', 'showing', 'gorgeous', 'sets', 'costumery', 'age', 'legendary', 'court', 'decadence', 'debauchery', 'Also', 'dark', 'shadowed', 'reports', 'Plague', 'are', 'nearing', 'London', 'leaving', 'people', 'terrified', 'desperate', 'need', 'preparation.As', 'leave', 'more', 'affluent', 'side', 'Merivel', 'tale', 'find', 'penniless', 'need', 'old', 'trusted', 'friend', 'John', 'Pierce', 'practicing', 'medicine', 'other', 'familial', 'Quakers', 'small', 'communal', 'type', 'setting', 'are', 'dealing', ""'mad"", 'people', 'society', 'where', 'are', 'living', 'lives', 'together', 'Pierce', 'Merivel', 'are', 'overjoyed', 'be', 'reunited', 'other', 'also', 'opportunity', 'be', 'practicing', 'together', 'again', 'passion', 'joy', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'quenched', 'even', 'most', 'dismal', 'depressing', 'situations', 'new', 'lively', 'techniques', 'treatment', 'patients', 'new', 'life', 'one', 'Katherine', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'who', 'plagued', 'insomnia.The', 'lovely', 'Irish', 'Katherine', 'walks', 'day', 'night', 'tree', 'courtyard', 'practicing', 'leaving', 'step', 'Merivel', 'more', 'more', 'beguiled', 'Always', 'contemplating', 'what', 'madness', 'what', 'only', 'need', 'relief', 'despair', 'time', 'Katherine', 'Merivel', 'begin', 'meeting', 'night', 'secret', 'Pierce', 'gravely', 'ill', 'deeply', 'saddened', 'longtime', 'friend', 'sickness', 'not', 'leave', 'side', 'trying', 'comfort', 'talk', 'different', 'reasons', 'why', 'Pierce', 'Merivel', 'perfect', 'brilliant', 'doctoral', 'ways.As', 'actions', 'lead', 'consequences', 'Merivel', 'Katherine', 'are', 'asked', 'leave', 'together', 'hospital', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'place', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'residence', 'back', 'where', 'started', 'London', 'Plague', 'broken', 'out', 'people', 'are', 'dying', 'droves', 'Merivel', 'dealing', 'pregnant', 'Katherine', 'also', 'restored', 'passion', 'care', 'story', 'conclusion', 'later', 'find', 'age', 'Restoration', 'Robert', 'Merivel', 'been', 'restored', 'own', 'passion', 'life', 'lives', 'others', 'everything', 'everything', 'gains']",Restoration VHS

Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[11, 12]","Visually magnificent, with plenty of opportunities for oppressive opulence in this delicious, but ultimately convoluted epic, *Restoration* is a lovely mess. Spanning the reign of Charles II, the great fire, the plague, ad nauseum, the ""restoration"" refers to, not only the period, but the human condition. But that conclusion is a difficult one to arrive at, and will only be understood by those viewers who actually sit through the movie. Shot in England and Wales, and winning Academy Awards for Art Direction and Costumes, the script involves a promising young doctor, Jack Merivel (Downey), whose gifts attract the attention of the King. Entering the revered court circle, Merivel has the delights of the world at his fingertips and ultimately succumbs to debauchery. But it is a story of restoration (as well as *the* Restoration) and redemption, with certain timeless aspects that have modern consequences, but the script begins to fray throughout the second half. With the exception of an unpleasant, jarring characterization of a mentally ill woman by Meg Foster (whose forte is definitely not period pieces), the leading and supporting roles are well cast. Downey has an appeal and charm (one that survived his recent tribulations), and gives Merivel humor, irony and dedication, in addition to the human foibles he falls victim to. Neill carries off the role of King Charles II with style and assurance, as he seeks to secure the permanent services of his mistress by marrying her off the Merivel, thus keeping her near. The King has selected Merivel for his inability to be placated with one woman - Merivel's desires keep him on a constant conquest for new and different lasciviousness - but the King's one condition is that Merivel not fall in love with his own wife. Needless to say, that is exactly what occurs, and thus begins the tumultuous fall from grace. And that's just the first part of this lengthy movie. The second half deals with Merivel's quest for redemption - not from the King, but from himself and God. It involves his daughter by the Meg Ryan character, and this is where the story changes from costume drama to social commentary. It is through Merivel's personal travails, as well as those inherent in the period: disease, pestilence and ignorance, that Merivel understands that the only reason he is on earth is to care for this child that is an extension of himself. His flight to find her and prove his worthiness in overcoming the obstacles set before him is a moment that would have been served at little earlier in the film. Despite the lush cinematography, there is an overdose factor involved that, once the outcome of the movie is evident, the viewer yearns for it to hurry along and be over. That said, it also leaves lingering memories of beauty and gratification.",3,Flawed but Fabulous,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2809,"['Visually', 'magnificent', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'oppressive', 'opulence', 'delicious', 'ultimately', 'convoluted', 'epic', '*Restoration*', 'lovely', 'mess', 'Spanning', 'reign', 'Charles', 'II', 'great', 'fire', 'plague', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'restoration', 'refers', 'not', 'only', 'period', 'human', 'condition', 'conclusion', 'difficult', 'one', 'arrive', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'understood', 'viewers', 'who', 'actually', 'sit', 'movie', 'Shot', 'England', 'Wales', 'winning', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Art', 'Direction', 'Costumes', 'script', 'promising', 'young', 'doctor', 'Jack', 'Merivel', 'Downey', 'gifts', 'attract', 'attention', 'King', 'Entering', 'revered', 'court', 'circle', 'Merivel', 'delights', 'world', 'fingertips', 'ultimately', 'succumbs', 'debauchery', 'story', 'restoration', 'as', 'well', '*the*', 'Restoration', 'redemption', 'certain', 'timeless', 'aspects', 'have', 'modern', 'consequences', 'script', 'fray', 'second', 'half', 'exception', 'unpleasant', 'jarring', 'characterization', 'mentally', 'ill', 'woman', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'forte', 'definitely', 'not', 'period', 'pieces', 'leading', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'Downey', 'appeal', 'charm', 'one', 'survived', 'recent', 'tribulations', 'Merivel', 'humor', 'irony', 'dedication', 'addition', 'human', 'victim', 'Neill', 'role', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'style', 'assurance', 'secure', 'permanent', 'services', 'mistress', 'marrying', 'Merivel', 'thus', 'keeping', 'near', 'King', 'selected', 'Merivel', 'inability', 'be', 'placated', 'one', 'woman', 'Merivel', 'desires', 'keep', 'constant', 'conquest', 'new', 'different', 'lasciviousness', 'King', 'one', 'condition', 'Merivel', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'own', 'wife', 'Needless', 'say', 'exactly', 'what', 'thus', 'tumultuous', 'fall', 'grace', 'just', 'first', 'part', 'lengthy', 'movie', 'second', 'half', 'deals', 'Merivel', 'quest', 'redemption', 'not', 'King', 'God', 'daughter', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'character', 'where', 'story', 'changes', 'costume', 'drama', 'social', 'commentary', 'Merivel', 'personal', 'travails', 'as', 'well', 'inherent', 'period', 'disease', 'pestilence', 'ignorance', 'Merivel', 'only', 'reason', 'earth', 'care', 'child', 'extension', 'flight', 'find', 'prove', 'worthiness', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'set', 'moment', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'served', 'little', 'earlier', 'film', 'lush', 'cinematography', 'overdose', 'factor', 'involved', 'once', 'outcome', 'movie', 'evident', 'viewer', 'hurry', 'along', 'be', 'over', 'said', 'also', 'lingering', 'memories', 'beauty', 'gratification']",Restoration VHS
