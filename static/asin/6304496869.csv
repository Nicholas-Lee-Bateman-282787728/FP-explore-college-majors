426039,A217UEH83RHN1Z,6304496869,Amazon Customer,"[5, 5]","I was a Junior in college when the Cuban Missle Crisis erupted. Like so many ordinary people at the time, much of what was known was limited to what the media and the government made available. I clearly remember walking to class wondering if we were about to become part of a giant mushroom cloud. The tension was palpable and nearly unbearable.Years later two films came out on DVD - the Kevin Costner production, and the film version of the stage production which is this film. I've watched both to fill in a lot of gaps in my knowledge of the time. In my humble opinion, The Missles of October is a far better portrayal of the actual events and the debates about courses of action.William Devane was excellent in a flattering but very businesslike portrayal of John Kennedy, and the rest of the large cast was equally impressive. Because the film was made before the collapse of the Soviet Union, recent revelations regarding the Soviet side of the crisis were not included which would have made this docu-drama absolutely blockbuster great.Let no one try to convince you that the events of October 1962 were anything less than a bone chilling crisis where nuclear annihilation was not only possible, but looked to be probable. This film captures the events to a remarkably good degree. I heartily recommend it not only as an excellent historical document, but a wakeup call for today regarding new nuclear threats emerging in today's world.",5,How Well I Remember,1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,1445,"['was', 'Junior', 'college', 'when', 'Cuban', 'Missle', 'Crisis', 'erupted', 'so', 'many', 'ordinary', 'people', 'time', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'known', 'was', 'limited', 'what', 'media', 'government', 'made', 'available', 'clearly', 'remember', 'walking', 'class', 'wondering', 'were', 'about', 'become', 'part', 'giant', 'mushroom', 'cloud', 'tension', 'was', 'palpable', 'nearly', 'unbearable.Years', 'later', 'two', 'films', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'production', 'film', 'version', 'stage', 'production', 'film', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'fill', 'lot', 'gaps', 'knowledge', 'time', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Missles', 'October', 'far', 'better', 'portrayal', 'actual', 'events', 'debates', 'courses', 'action.William', 'Devane', 'was', 'excellent', 'flattering', 'very', 'businesslike', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Kennedy', 'rest', 'large', 'cast', 'was', 'equally', 'impressive', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'collapse', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'recent', 'revelations', 'regarding', 'Soviet', 'side', 'crisis', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'docu-drama', 'absolutely', 'blockbuster', 'great.Let', 'one', 'try', 'convince', 'events', 'October', '1962', 'were', 'anything', 'less', 'bone', 'chilling', 'crisis', 'where', 'nuclear', 'annihilation', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'possible', 'looked', 'be', 'probable', 'film', 'events', 'remarkably', 'good', 'degree', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'not', 'only', 'excellent', 'historical', 'document', 'wakeup', 'call', 'today', 'regarding', 'new', 'nuclear', 'threats', 'emerging', 'today', 'world']",The Missiles of October

It does not have the flash of the more recent 'Thirteen Days' but it is very gripping in its own right. The movie is filmed almost as a play and I liked this aspect of it.I really enjoyed William Devane's JFK. He really does a good job of playing this now larger than life character to a understandable level. The decisions that were made by Kennedy were truly momentous and Devane brings out the torture of every political move that JFK had to make. Martin Sheen is also good in his portrayal of RFK. Howard Da Silva deserves mention in his depiction of Nikita Khrushchev. The tightrope that Khrushchev was also walking is dramatized. 'Missiles of October' shows more of the Soviet side than was depicted in 'Thirteen Days'.The DVD is sadly bare bones. The picture quality is decent and the sound adequate.For any student of JFK, the Cold War, or the American Presidency this movie comes highly recommended!PS: Kenny O'Donnell ,personal assistant to the president, wrote a very good memoir on working with JFK that I recommend called 'Johnny- We Hardly Knew Ye'. There are many interesting anecdotes about JFK and his political career. O'Donnell is a bit character in 'Missiles of October' but is played by Kevin Costner in 'Thirteen Days' and the story is told mainly through his eyes.",5,"""Just now, I work and he sleeps.

An excellent cast of TV character actors inhabit a series of austere sets meant to replicate the White House, the Presidium of the Soviet Union, and a handful of other venues where crucial decisions were debated.  The austere sets increase the tight focus on the principals as they struggle with the crisis and with their emotions.  William Devane and a young Martin Sheen are outstanding as President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert, at the center of an agonizing decision-making process.  Howard de Silva plays a cantankerous and cunning Soviet Chairman Khrushchev, who discovers he may be riding a tiger he cannot dismount in the crisis.The story is presented in a even-handed manner that reinforces the difficulties for both the Americans and the Soviets, including the supreme challenge for each of correctly decerning the intentions of the other.  The intercutting of actual film footage showing military preparations adds to the building suspense.  The dialogue is drawn or extrapolated from the historical record.This film works both as a drama and as an exploration of an historical event still studied as a model of crisis decision-making.

There is none of the medical and physical problems the plagued Jack's running of the country nor any reference at all to his constant sexual escapades that no doubt interferred with his presidency. We know what President Clinton did, but we have little knowledge of Jack's constant chasing of women bed partners that must have had to be interspersed with his trying to run the country, a job he did rather badly as we now know.Both these versions tell the story of the Cuban missle crisis, But I often wonder how much the Kennedys really had to do with solving the problem. I do suspect, given what we know about both Jack and Bobby now, whether they had the smarts to pull this off or did they just luck out and have a really good group of advisors that have never gotten the honors they deserved.I would not now purchase the earlier version but put my money down for the second.

426055,A6QMY5WPTVAT1,6304496869,"Gregory J. Casteel ""Dr. Gregory J. Casteel""","[3, 3]","This is a truly spectacular docudrama.  If you want to learn about the Cuban Missile Crisis, this is the one film that you absolutely must watch.  Other movies have been made about those thirteen tense days in October of 1962 when the United States and the Soviet Union narrowly avoided a nuclear war -- most notably the Kevin Costner film ""Thirteen Days"" (2000), which is actually well worth watching -- but none has even come close to the brilliance of the 1974 teleplay ""The Missiles of October"" starring William Devane, Martin Sheen, Ralph Bellamy, and Howard DaSilva.  The production values on this film are fairly crude, largely because it was staged as if it were a play rather than a big-budget motion picture like ""Thirteen Days"".  But when dealing with real historical events -- and especially events of such grave magnitude as the ones depicted in this film -- it's far more important to get the human element right than to worry about sets, cinematography, and special effects.  ""The Missiles of October"" gets the human element right, and does so far better than any other movie ever made about these events, including ""Thirteen Days"".William Devane and Martin Sheen give us an amazing portrayal of the Kennedy brothers.  Sheen, who is brilliant in everything he has ever been in, made an absolutely convincing Bobby Kennedy.  But it was Devane who really stole the show.  It seemed almost as if he were possessed by the ghost of Jack Kennedy, his performance was so perfect.  The main complaint I had with ""Thirteen Days"" was that I just didn't find the portrayal of Jack and Bobby Kennedy convincing enough; and this was just a bit too distracting.  This wasn't a problem with ""The Missiles of October"" -- while watching it, I could easily suspend my disbelief enough to convince myself that the people on the screen really were President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.  Howard DaSilva also gives a very convincing performance as Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.  I was less pleased with some of the other characters, though.  Ralph Bellamy and Dana Eclar were just not really all that convincing as U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson and Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, respectively.  (Here, ""Thirteen Days"" did a far better job of portraying these two characters.)  Nonetheless, overall, I think that ""The Missiles of October"" gives a more accurate portrayal of the key figures in the Cuban Missile Crisis than ""Thirteen Days"".And the events portrayed in ""The Missiles of October"" are as historically accurate as was possible at the time this film was made.  (The depiction of what happened behind closed doors in the Kremlin was rather speculative, of course; and some new information about the Cuban Missile Crisis has come to light since then; but, in general, it's still perhaps the most historically accurate account of these events ever presented on film.)  The script was based largely on Robert F. Kennedy's book, ""Thirteen Days"", in which he described what went on behind closed doors at the White House during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The movie ""Thirteen Days"" -- which, in spite of its title, was not based on Bobby Kennedy's memoir -- is a partially fictionalized account of what happened.  Though it includes some previously classified details that were not publicly available at the time ""The Missiles of October"" was made, it also includes some moments that never actually happened, but that were inserted into the film purely for dramatic effect.  So, on the whole, ""The Missiles of October"" is a more reliable retelling of the historical events than is ""Thirteen Days"".  In my view, both films are worth watching; but if you care more about historical accuracy and a believable portrayal of the key figures than about superficial cinematic appeal, then ""The Missiles of October"" is by far the better film.",5,The definitive film about the Cuban Missile Crisis,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,3884,"['truly', 'spectacular', 'docudrama', 'want', 'learn', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'one', 'film', 'absolutely', 'must', 'watch', 'Other', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'thirteen', 'tense', 'days', 'October', '1962', 'when', 'United', 'States', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'narrowly', 'avoided', 'nuclear', 'war', 'most', 'notably', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'film', 'Thirteen', 'Days', '2000', 'actually', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'none', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'brilliance', '1974', 'teleplay', 'Missiles', 'October', 'starring', 'William', 'Devane', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'Howard', 'DaSilva', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'are', 'fairly', 'crude', 'largely', 'was', 'staged', 'were', 'play', 'rather', 'big-budget', 'motion', 'picture', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'when', 'dealing', 'real', 'historical', 'events', 'especially', 'events', 'such', 'grave', 'magnitude', 'ones', 'depicted', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'get', 'human', 'element', 'right', 'worry', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'Missiles', 'October', 'human', 'element', 'right', 'so', 'far', 'better', 'other', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'events', 'including', 'Thirteen', 'Days', '.William', 'Devane', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'give', 'amazing', 'portrayal', 'Kennedy', 'brothers', 'Sheen', 'who', 'brilliant', 'everything', 'ever', 'been', 'made', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'Devane', 'who', 'really', 'stole', 'show', 'seemed', 'almost', 'were', 'possessed', 'ghost', 'Jack', 'Kennedy', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'perfect', 'main', 'complaint', 'had', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'was', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'portrayal', 'Jack', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'convincing', 'enough', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'distracting', 'was', ""n't"", 'problem', 'Missiles', 'October', 'watching', 'could', 'easily', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'enough', 'convince', 'people', 'screen', 'really', 'were', 'President', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'brother', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Howard', 'DaSilva', 'also', 'very', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Soviet', 'leader', 'Nikita', 'Khrushchev', 'was', 'less', 'pleased', 'other', 'characters', 'though', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'Dana', 'Eclar', 'were', 'just', 'not', 'really', 'that', 'convincing', 'U.N', 'Ambassador', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'Robert', 'S.', 'McNamara', 'respectively', 'Here', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'portraying', 'two', 'characters', 'Nonetheless', 'overall', 'think', 'Missiles', 'October', 'more', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'key', 'figures', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'events', 'portrayed', 'Missiles', 'October', 'are', 'historically', 'accurate', 'was', 'possible', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'depiction', 'what', 'happened', 'behind', 'closed', 'doors', 'Kremlin', 'was', 'rather', 'speculative', 'course', 'new', 'information', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'come', 'light', 'then', 'general', 'still', 'perhaps', 'most', 'historically', 'accurate', 'account', 'events', 'ever', 'presented', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'based', 'largely', 'Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'book', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'described', 'what', 'went', 'closed', 'doors', 'White', 'House', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'movie', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'spite', 'title', 'was', 'not', 'based', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'memoir', 'partially', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'what', 'happened', 'previously', 'classified', 'details', 'were', 'not', 'publicly', 'available', 'time', 'Missiles', 'October', 'was', 'made', 'also', 'moments', 'never', 'actually', 'happened', 'were', 'inserted', 'film', 'purely', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'So', 'whole', 'Missiles', 'October', 'more', 'reliable', 'retelling', 'historical', 'events', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'view', 'films', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'care', 'more', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'believable', 'portrayal', 'key', 'figures', 'superficial', 'cinematic', 'appeal', 'then', 'Missiles', 'October', 'far', 'better', 'film']",The Missiles of October

426057,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,6304496869,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[4, 4]","In the autumn of 1962, the Soviet Union began placing medium and intermediate range nuclear missile sites in Cuba.  These missiles were a direct threat to the entire United States, Mexico, Latin America, and portions of Canada.  During those thirteen days, the United States and the Soviet Union teetered on the brink of nuclear war.  This excellent movie depicts what life was like in the Kennedy White House during those long, trying days.William Devane stars as President John F. Kennedy.  He is told that intelligence reports have shown that the Soviets are building nuclear missile sites in Cuba.  Upon confirmation of the reports, the President, along with his cabinet members, begin to formulate a plan as to how to deal with the threat.  Bobby Kennedy (Martin Sheen) is in favor of a naval blockade, while members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff prefer bombing the sites.  President Kennedy is determined to not let the Soviets know that the U.S. has found out about the missiles.  As each day passes, the missiles get closer and closer to being operational.  The tension continues to rise throughout the crisis, and the strain is evident on President Kennedy's face.Meanwhile, Premier Nikita Khrushchev (Howard Da Silva) has proclaimed that the missiles were placed in Cuba as protection for Castro's regime after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion attempt.  He claims they are for defense only.The two sides continue to free-fall toward nuclear war.  Kennedy insists that the missiles must be removed.  The Soviets want the United States to remove their missiles from Turkey before they pull out from Cuba.  A naval blockade of the island is set up, with the Americans given orders to stop and turn back any Soviet vessel trying to get past the blockade.  The Soviets threaten to sink the American vessels so their ships may pass.  Unfortunately, the blockade doesn't work as planned, and soon, the missile bases were operational.  Now, Kennedy had another choice to make; should he bomb the sites?  During this time, an American U-2 spy plane was shot down by the Cuban missiles.  The two superpowers moved ever closer to war.  But, an 11th hour breakthrough between the two countries saved the world from nuclear war.  The Soviets agreed to remove all of their missiles from Cuba if the United States pledged to not invade Cuba.  This agreement saved the world from nuclear armageddon.This is an excellent movie.  William Devane does a first-rate job as President Kennedy.  He even managed to copy Kennedy's thick Boston accent.  Martin Sheen is equally good as JFK's loyal brother.  Perhaps one of the best performances is delivered by Ralph Bellamy as U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson.  The scenes where he's sparring with the Soviet ambassador, telling him he's prepared to wait until hell freezes over for a response is one of the best parts of the film.Although I was not alive during this crisis, I've read much about it, and I commend President Kennedy for his unwavering insistence that the missiles be removed from Cuba, and this movie does his memory justice in that aspect.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The historical accuracy is excellent, and the acting is impeccable.  For thirteen days in the autumn of 1962, the security of the world hinged on two people.

By chance, a commercial announced that ""The Missiles of October"", one of television's first attempts at a docu-drama (the other being The Andersonville Trial) was about to come on. We decided to wait 'a few minutes' to see some of it. Three hours later we were still in our chairs with our coats on. Silence pervaded the room as the drama unfurled and there was an overwhelming sense of ""you are there"" that kept us riveted to the story. Looking back now I realize that this was one of the greatest stage productions ever made on what then had been somewhat of a mystery to the average American, namely, what had actually transpired during the thirteen days of intense struggle of October of 1962, when the world was on the edge of nuclear Armageddon. This work is very intellectual, superbly written and gripping in dramatic scenes. It is important to remember that this was shown during an era of STRONG anti-military feeling. The country was winding down from Vietnam and to see a positive resolvency of a possible global catastrophe by politicians concerning an incident in '62 from when we were only children reminded us of what America CAN accomplish when sane men seek safe ways out of conflict. There is a LOT of good acting. The scenes are cleverly done, shifting between Washington and Moscow with tid-bits of B&W 'events in the world' film thrown in. We get to see ""inside"" the exec committees of both the White House and Kremlin and how they plot strategy. Attempts to duplicate the success of this stage drama failed miserably.

My VHS copy of Missiles, which is over 15 years old, has degraded greatly in picture and sound quality, so I was hoping that the DVD copy would be an improvement.  I was not disappointed.  It has an amazingly crisp picture and the sound is excellent.When the movie Thirteen Days came out I was anxious to compare it to Missiles.  Thirteen Days was a good film, but I still prefer The Missiles of October.  All the performances are excellent, but William Devane, Martin Sheen and Howard DaSilva top the list.  I was barely six years old when the actual event occurred back in 1962 so I don't remember the incident from then.  However, I did see the movie when it originally aired in 1974 and was greatly impacted by it then.  They did an excellent job in weaving the actual documentary footage together with their dramatization.  Watching the thirteen day countdown to possible worldwide nuclear destruction is compelling watching.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a taste for history, suspense, excellent performances or as an example of how good television can be when given the chance.",5,Finally on DVD!,999820800,"09 7, 2001",2001,1215,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'Missiles', 'October', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'first', 'got', 'DVD', 'player', 'year', 'ago', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Missiles', '15', 'years', 'old', 'degraded', 'greatly', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'hoping', 'DVD', 'copy', 'would', 'be', 'improvement', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'amazingly', 'crisp', 'picture', 'sound', 'movie', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'anxious', 'compare', 'Missiles', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'still', 'prefer', 'Missiles', 'October', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'William', 'Devane', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Howard', 'DaSilva', 'top', 'list', 'was', 'barely', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'actual', 'event', 'occurred', 'back', '1962', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'incident', 'then', 'However', 'did', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', '1974', 'was', 'greatly', 'impacted', 'then', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'weaving', 'actual', 'documentary', 'footage', 'together', 'dramatization', 'Watching', 'thirteen', 'day', 'countdown', 'possible', 'worldwide', 'nuclear', 'destruction', 'compelling', 'watching', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'taste', 'history', 'suspense', 'excellent', 'performances', 'example', 'how', 'good', 'television', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'given', 'chance']",The Missiles of October
426066,A1FNW6H983I87V,6304496869,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[3, 4]","THE MISSILES OF OCTOBER is a tense, tight, made for TV, docudrama about the Cuban missile crisis. It is a Golden Laurel award-winning film based on all historical evidence about those 13 days in October, 1962. Many of us have forgotten or never knew the crisis 45 years ago that brought us to the edge of nuclear war and possible extinction of life as we know it. Unbeknown to America and with full denial from Russia, the USSR had begun to build a nuclear missile arsenal in Cuba that was capable of destroying all of America and most of South America and it was 90 miles from our shores. When a U-2 spy plane discovered the project from 14 miles above the earth, it precipitated perhaps one of the greatest confrontations in world history. The two superpowers, the two nations capable of annihilating one another were face to face. Not that these weapons weren't already the greatest concern of the world already, but why was Russia putting these clearly 'offensive weapons' only 90 miles from the U.S. What were they up to? JFK and his administration had 10 days to figure it out and react before the missiles would be fully installed. The film is about those 13 days in October when the U.S. and Russia played the ultimate nuclear chess game. The film is mostly about the American side but also shows a very interesting side of the Russians during this time as it bounces back and forth between the two leaders. The tension was unimaginable as this was no theoretical discussion about war, this was nuclear war on our doorstep. It makes the discussion of WMD's in Iraq look like a elementary discussion. In reality, this might be a great film for all our leaders to watch before going to war. Kennedy had to face Kruschev as well as his own military machine, who wanted to take out the nuclear weapons with military force. Kennedy, for all his personal flaws, really seemed to grasp the dangers of war and what responding militarily could do to the world. He chose, instead, to use our military might as the bargaining chip for peace. Kruschev, also, had to battle his 'comrades' who were eager to take on the U.S. and he showed great courage in standing up to them and negotiating with the U.S. This is a well done film about a historical moment in our history that could have changed the course of world history overnight. As one reviewer said, this proves that history does not have to be boring. Should be required viewing for everyone under 50 as a reminder that we can deal with the most difficult of all situations and not have to go to war, even though it could have ended up with two nations destroying each other.

426075,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,6304496869,Roger J. Buffington,"[46, 49]","There is very little to criticize about this dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The film mainly focuses on the deliberations on the American side, i.e. President John F. Kennedy and his Ex-Comm group (""Executive Committee of the National Security Council"") as they try to force the Soviets to remove the missiles from Cuba while avoiding a nuclear conflict.  The film successfully conveys the fears and difficulties faced by JFK and his team, their thoughts and deliberations.  The script is fairly close to the actual facts as they are understood today.  This is a wonderfully educational production that any parent would do well to watch with his or her children.Devane is pretty good as JFK.  I thought that Martin Sheen absolutely nailed Bobby Kennedy.  The supporting actors were uniformly excellent.  Good casting throughout.One of the excellent things about the production is the occasional interjection of period news bulletins of nuclear tests, the escalating conflict, etc.  These added a wonderful sense of authenticity even as they entertained.A few quibbles, all minor.  I thought that the movie somewhat (not excessively) idolized the Kennedys.  It was a bit much when one member of Ex Comm commented that ""Bobby [Kennedy] I confess your moral arguments [against invading Cuba] never occurred to me...""  Come on, of course they did.  The record shows that Ex Comm debated these issues extensively. Nor was Bobby Kennedy against invading Cuba--the record is pretty clear that both Kennedys had been pushing for removing Castro by various means before the crisis began.  Bobby Kennedy's comment that bombing the missiles out of Cuba would be like a ""reverse Pearl Harbor"" was disdained as amateurish by most of Ex Comm.  The movie barely acknowledges that. [Dean Acheson characterizes that analogy to JFK at one point as ""false and pejorative...""].  The movie portrays the US Navy as lusting after conflict in a manner I thought was unseemly--this was my only major criticism of the film.  [""Thirteen Days"" shares this flaw.]  Hollywood often cannot pass up a chance to take a swipe at the military.This is an incredibly worthwhile production that I make a point of watching every year or so.

426083,A1GZKHEQWTS4Z5,6304496869,Thomas Moody,"[3, 3]","With the publication of &quot;The Kennedy Tapes&quot; (May and Zelikow 1997) and, more recently, &quot;Averting the Final Failure&quot; (Sheldon Stern 2004), we now know what exactly was said by whom and when in the White House during these heady 13 days known universally as &quot;The Cuban Missile Crisis&quot;. What has never really been conveyed (in print or otherwise) is the true &quot;feeling&quot; of what these leaders went through...I'd submit that that the true value of this video is the portrayal of the immediacy and emotion invoked by all participants during the Crisis. This film may lack some historical accuracy, but it more than makes up for it as an emotional target for this period and remains, to this day, an important and believable reference for this seminal period of the Cold War.William Devane, Martin Sheen and William DaSalva portray a version of the Crisis that is at once believable and accurate as far as the emotional element is concerned, and convey an amazingly accurate &quot;emotional history&quot;. This, coupled with the known version of the Crisis in 1974, gives a view of the Kennedy White House inner-workings that has remained somewhat the &quot;standard&quot; for understanding the strategy of the &quot;Best and Brightest&quot; who made up the Kennedy Cabinet. Character development is based on RFK's version of the Crisis in his post-humous work &quot;Thirteen Days&quot;, and we know now that this was somewhat contrived...only to the extent that some things were said or believed that were overly amplified for emphasis. The true feeling of these exalted gentlemen has never been questioned and I think that the prospective viewer will be impressed with the detail and emotional content of this work.So enjoy this movie and take from it the exacting and crucial motivations of a Government under siege and you'll be impressed (as I've continued to be for these 30 years) that &quot;The Missiles of October&quot; portrays the Kennedy government accurately as it struggled through the tortuous 13 days of the Crisis and leaves as it's legacy the true emotions of those heady days.
