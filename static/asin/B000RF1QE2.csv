But, one night as I was flipping through channels I caught an episode and have loved it ever since.  Great acting, great stories and a great cast.  Hopefully the TV execs realize that the Nielson ratings are just plain wrong.  Everyone I know that has seen it LOVES this show.  If they advertised it a little more, understood that ratings are always a little lower on Fridays and that many, many people (like me) are recording this on their  DVR or Tivo (which is why the antiquated Nielson ratings don't pick it up) they would figure out what everyone else knows.

If you are, or ever were into filmmaking, you will find lots of continuity errors.  &#34;Extras&#34; looking into the cameras.  Moments of bad acting.  Props in the wrong place from scene-to-scene.  Scars missing, then re-appearing.  Pristine clean uniforms after a full football game, etc.  I understand this is not a movie and it's hard to get great extras but try to look the other away during the New York City scenes.  The background crowd is really into it and checking out the actors and the cameras.  I'm still in season 4 and it has not lost my interest as of yet but I can see where it's going.  I'm thinking that season 5 was a flop -- thus the discontinuation of the show.  But I'm not there yet.

1081195,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B000RF1QE2,Brian Maitland,"[1, 1]","I don't think you need me explaining to you what this TV series is about. Suffice it to say the first season is certainly one of the best given it's an incredible 22 episodes long. That length alone allows stories and characters to develop at pretty much the pace of actual life in this fictional small Texas town.What is hilarious is the fact almost every football game shown has the Dillon Panthers winning and usually in overly dramatic ""cardiac kids"" fashion. When in one episode the play-by=play announcer says the Panthers are at .500, it doesn't jive with what we see throughout the first season as they basically almost never lose.I think the series loses a lot by not showing more of the losses. It would have added more drama. Even so you'll be in tears in a lot of episodes as the writers sure know how to wring emotions out weekly. They also address many of the off-field problems associated with high school football (steroids, racism, sexism, alcohism and any other -isms that you can think of), but ultimately it's an optimistic and highly uplifting series. Plus you do not even have to like football to enjoy this. The relationships are what this series are all about. Throw in the choicest guys and girls on TV and that makes for as good eye candy as the football action.The extras are a bunch of deleted scenes and a ""making of"" that I actually wished was a bit longer.I'm sure after you get through this all you'll agree Coach Taylor (Kyle Chandler) and fullback Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch) are the stars of the series for their ability to let just a look or a few words tell so much.",5,sports is just the setup for more,1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,1603,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'explaining', 'what', 'TV', 'series', 'Suffice', 'say', 'first', 'season', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'given', 'incredible', '22', 'episodes', 'long', 'length', 'alone', 'stories', 'characters', 'develop', 'pretty', 'much', 'pace', 'actual', 'life', 'fictional', 'small', 'Texas', 'town.What', 'hilarious', 'fact', 'almost', 'football', 'game', 'shown', 'Dillon', 'Panthers', 'winning', 'usually', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'cardiac', 'kids', 'fashion', 'When', 'one', 'episode', 'play-by=play', 'announcer', 'Panthers', 'are', '.500', ""n't"", 'jive', 'what', 'see', 'first', 'season', 'basically', 'almost', 'never', 'lose.I', 'think', 'series', 'lot', 'not', 'showing', 'more', 'losses', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'more', 'drama', 'Even', ""'ll"", 'be', 'tears', 'lot', 'episodes', 'writers', 'sure', 'know', 'how', 'wring', 'emotions', 'out', 'weekly', 'also', 'address', 'many', 'off-field', 'problems', 'associated', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'steroids', 'racism', 'sexism', 'alcohism', 'other', '-isms', 'can', 'think', 'ultimately', 'optimistic', 'highly', 'uplifting', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'like', 'football', 'enjoy', 'relationships', 'are', 'what', 'series', 'are', 'Throw', 'choicest', 'guys', 'girls', 'TV', 'as', 'good', 'eye', 'candy', 'football', 'action.The', 'extras', 'are', 'bunch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making', 'actually', 'wished', 'was', 'bit', 'longer.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'get', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'Tim', 'Riggins', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'are', 'stars', 'series', 'ability', 'let', 'just', 'look', 'few', 'words', 'tell', 'so', 'much']",Friday Night Lights: The First Season

I'd rank it not only as one of the best sports movies ever made, but as one of the best movies of ANY kind of the decade thus far.Those are big shoes for a television series to try and fill, but I have to say, this one is getting the job done pretty well.The pilot episode is far and away the weakest of the entire season, and it had me more than little worried that the series was going to tank right off the bat.  It's not a bad episode -- just a little flat and uninspired (surprising, considering that it and the movie shared the same director, Peter Berg).Things began to improve very quickly with the second episode, however, and the series seemed literally to get better every episode, right through to the end of the season.The entire cast is terrific, but I think special mention needs to be made for the closest thing the show has to leads: Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton.  Both are terrific actors who are past due for real stardom, and if there were any justice, this show would do it for them.  They are utterly convincing in their roles as the team's coach and the school's guidance counselor.  Oh yeah, and they're married.  Together, their portrayal of a married couple is quite possibly the best, most convincing and illuminating, and most all-around affecting filmed relationship that I have ever seen on television.  You'd swear at some points that you were watching a documentary -- and a really good one, at that.This is, quite simply, one of the best shows on television, on every level: the writing, the acting, the directing, the lighting, the music, EVERYTHING about this show is top-notch.

1081202,AB34G6VKP28L,B000RF1QE2,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 0]","Clear heads. Full hearts. Can't lose.Football is everything in the small town of Dillon, Texas. High expectations rest on the shoulders of the brand new High School Coach, Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler). He has immediate respect on the field, and a certain amount of respect among the township, but whether he stays or he goes depends on the outcome of his first game. His wife Tami (Connie Britton) wastes no time in ""becoming useful,"" in applying to be a counselor at the school, while his daughter Julie (Aimee Teegarden) catches the eye of young Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford), his back-up quarterback. The real star of the Panthers is Jason Street (Scott Porter), a young man with terrific instincts whom everyone knows is destined for stardom...Until he puts his head down in a game, and winds up with a broken spine. Jason is crippled from the waist down and his injury sends shockwaves through Dillon, influencing everyone in his life -- his girlfriend Lyla (Minka Kelley), his best friend Tim (Taylor Kitsch), Tim's girlfriend Tyra (Adrianne Palicki), and especially Matt, who has to step up and take his place in the heat of the moment -- a place he is not prepared for. Coach Taylor has gone from having a sure-fire shot at the state championships to a team lost without its quarterback. His job, and his reputation, are on the line, not to mention the healing that must go in the lives of everyone involved.I'm not a big football fan, but as this first season unfolded I became caught up in these characters' lives and learned to truly care about them as individuals, as well as be excited for the outcome of their games. The success of this series is that it makes you invest emotionally in what happens next. It tackles sensitive topics with surprising and at times unexpected results. It is as all-American as it gets and that's nice. Most of the young people are deeply flawed, but always we have the Taylor family to fall back on -- a marriage that has routine arguments but remains strong, headed up by a man willing to put aside his dreams to be what his wife and daughter need. He is a father figure to the boys on the team, strong when he needs to be, and unflinching in doing the right thing. If you do not admire him midway through the season, you're missing the point.One of the most stirring episodes revolves around racism, when an assistant coach makes a stupid remark on television. I expected a completely different outcome to this two-episode arc than we were given; the show surprised me with its implication that people ought to be given second chances. The Taylors often fight, but their marriage is strong regardless. In fact, their biggest fight toward the end of the season is over who wants to be more selfless! I will admit that the implications of teenage sexuality were unfortunate, because it does somewhat diminish the luster of this series packing a moral punch. My biggest sorrow is that these kids act like Christians in church, but do not act like it outside of church. I don't think it is an implication of hypocrisy nearly as much as a sad reminder of the biggest threat to young people today: not living out their faith. If you choose to watch this series, it will reward you with some profound moments and many tears of both happiness and sorrow... but let it remind you that it's not enough to say you are a believer. You have to live it.Parental concerns: Implied teenage sex on numerous occasions, including some heavy duty make-out sessions and ""afterward"" opening scenes. A character is almost raped but fights off her assailant. There is a lot of underage drinking and some brutal fighting, in addition to football-related violence. Several times, beatings include hospitalization-worthy results. Bad language is mild but frequent.",4,Made me care about football,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,3781,"['Clear', 'heads', 'Full', 'hearts', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'lose.Football', 'everything', 'small', 'town', 'Dillon', 'Texas', 'High', 'expectations', 'rest', 'shoulders', 'brand', 'new', 'High', 'School', 'Coach', 'Eric', 'Taylor', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'immediate', 'respect', 'field', 'certain', 'amount', 'respect', 'township', 'outcome', 'first', 'game', 'wife', 'Tami', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'time', 'becoming', 'useful', 'applying', 'be', 'counselor', 'school', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'Aimee', 'Teegarden', 'eye', 'young', 'Matt', 'Saracen', 'Zach', 'Gilford', 'back-up', 'quarterback', 'real', 'star', 'Panthers', 'Jason', 'Street', 'Scott', 'Porter', 'young', 'man', 'terrific', 'instincts', 'whom', 'everyone', 'destined', 'stardom', 'head', 'down', 'game', 'up', 'broken', 'spine', 'Jason', 'crippled', 'waist', 'down', 'injury', 'shockwaves', 'Dillon', 'influencing', 'everyone', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'Lyla', 'Minka', 'Kelley', 'best', 'friend', 'Tim', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'Tim', 'girlfriend', 'Tyra', 'Adrianne', 'Palicki', 'especially', 'Matt', 'who', 'step', 'up', 'take', 'place', 'heat', 'moment', 'place', 'not', 'prepared', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'gone', 'having', 'sure-fire', 'shot', 'state', 'championships', 'team', 'lost', 'quarterback', 'job', 'reputation', 'are', 'line', 'not', 'mention', 'healing', 'must', 'go', 'lives', 'everyone', 'involved.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'football', 'fan', 'first', 'season', 'unfolded', 'became', 'caught', 'up', 'characters', 'lives', 'learned', 'truly', 'care', 'about', 'individuals', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'excited', 'outcome', 'games', 'success', 'series', 'invest', 'emotionally', 'what', 'next', 'sensitive', 'topics', 'surprising', 'times', 'unexpected', 'results', 'as', 'all-American', 'nice', 'Most', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'always', 'have', 'Taylor', 'family', 'fall', 'back', 'marriage', 'routine', 'arguments', 'strong', 'headed', 'up', 'man', 'willing', 'put', 'aside', 'dreams', 'be', 'what', 'wife', 'daughter', 'need', 'father', 'figure', 'boys', 'team', 'strong', 'when', 'be', 'unflinching', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'admire', 'midway', 'season', ""'re"", 'missing', 'point.One', 'most', 'stirring', 'episodes', 'revolves', 'racism', 'when', 'assistant', 'coach', 'stupid', 'remark', 'television', 'expected', 'completely', 'different', 'outcome', 'two-episode', 'arc', 'were', 'given', 'show', 'surprised', 'implication', 'people', 'ought', 'be', 'given', 'second', 'chances', 'Taylors', 'often', 'fight', 'marriage', 'strong', 'regardless', 'fact', 'biggest', 'fight', 'end', 'season', 'who', 'be', 'more', 'selfless', 'will', 'admit', 'implications', 'teenage', 'sexuality', 'were', 'unfortunate', 'somewhat', 'diminish', 'luster', 'series', 'packing', 'moral', 'punch', 'biggest', 'sorrow', 'kids', 'act', 'Christians', 'church', 'do', 'not', 'act', 'church', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'implication', 'hypocrisy', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'sad', 'reminder', 'biggest', 'threat', 'young', 'people', 'today', 'not', 'living', 'out', 'faith', 'choose', 'watch', 'series', 'will', 'reward', 'profound', 'moments', 'many', 'tears', 'happiness', 'sorrow', 'let', 'remind', 'not', 'enough', 'say', 'are', 'believer', 'have', 'live', 'it.Parental', 'concerns', 'Implied', 'teenage', 'sex', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'including', 'heavy', 'duty', 'make-out', 'sessions', 'afterward', 'opening', 'scenes', 'character', 'almost', 'raped', 'fights', 'off', 'assailant', 'lot', 'underage', 'drinking', 'brutal', 'fighting', 'addition', 'football-related', 'violence', 'Several', 'times', 'beatings', 'include', 'hospitalization-worthy', 'results', 'Bad', 'language', 'mild', 'frequent']",Friday Night Lights: The First Season

1081205,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000RF1QE2,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 5]","In a weird bit of irony, NBC's hit tv series ""Heroes"" was released on DVD the same day as ""Friday Night Lights"", critically lauded but ratings challenged as many wondered whether it would even last longer than a season. While Heroes got all the attention (admittedly deservedly), this show was one of those cult shows that was little seen but praised and underrated by many. But usually this means that the show is the absolute best on TV and we all know it's simply personal preference so while the show does have some small flaws, they never overwhelm the show which is a nice plus.Taking place in Dillon, Texas where the town's football team, the Panthers, is all the rage. But 2 new developments hit the town hard as a new coach is brought in, Eric Taylor, as well as the team's quarterback star Jason Street suffers an unfortunate accident leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Coach Taylor has to somehow bring his team back and make them faster and stronger with new quarterback, the confidence-lacking Matt Saracen. But of course, not everything is about football as everyone has their own issues to deal with such as affairs, drug taking, infights among the team as well as the town's bitterness towards the team should they lose. The team will have to muster everything they have as they make their way to the State Championships.It's strange to have a show that's not built around a unique premise such as superpowers (Heroes), man vs machine (Battlestar Galactica) or mystery upon mystery (Lost). Instead, this is a show about football and the people affected by it so it's more character-driven rather than CG effects and action scenes. While it's a different change of pace, it's also great to see an emphasis on acting in realistic situations which helps since it has a really talented cast. From Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton playing the most realistic couple I've seen on TV to Minka Kelly, the sexy-but-smart Lyla Garrity and Tyra Collette who's not just a bad girl for the sake of being a *****. My one problem is a couple of characters such as ""Smash"" Williams who has an ego bigger than the field he plays in. Even though he gets more deeper storylines, he still feels like that arrogant kid we first see him being.My other complaint is that the events that transpire within the episode are great filled with nuanced acting and believable situations but there are times you can't figure out where they were. While it's obvious some episodes like ""I Think We Should Have Sex"" where Taylor's daughter Julie says the episode title to her boyfriend, Matt the quarterback or ""Mud Bowl"" where the team plays on a homemade field but there are times where you remember a specific moment such as Lyla doing a bad*** moment at a car dealership or when Tyra goes after her mom's abusive boyfriend but you can't figure what episode these took place in. While it's obvious that the season arc, the team's struggle to get to State, is there but individual episodes might not have the weight of what came before it or afterwards.With the extras being skimpy, a behind the scenes featurette and tons of deleted scenes for the episodes just feels light against at least a couple of commentaries and could've benefited from being a bit more heavier in the extras. But with its lovely music by band Explosions in the Sky, a talented cast and a premise that you don't have to love to get (I STILL don't know how the hell you play football), it's still a show you can enjoy.",5,Underappreciated drama,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,3482,"['weird', 'bit', 'irony', 'NBC', 'hit', 'tv', 'series', 'Heroes', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'same', 'day', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'critically', 'lauded', 'ratings', 'challenged', 'many', 'wondered', 'would', 'even', 'last', 'longer', 'season', 'Heroes', 'got', 'attention', 'admittedly', 'deservedly', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'cult', 'shows', 'was', 'little', 'seen', 'praised', 'underrated', 'many', 'usually', 'show', 'absolute', 'best', 'TV', 'know', 'simply', 'personal', 'preference', 'so', 'show', 'have', 'small', 'flaws', 'never', 'overwhelm', 'show', 'nice', 'plus.Taking', 'place', 'Dillon', 'Texas', 'where', 'town', 'football', 'team', 'Panthers', 'rage', '2', 'new', 'developments', 'hit', 'town', 'hard', 'new', 'coach', 'brought', 'Eric', 'Taylor', 'as', 'well', 'team', 'quarterback', 'star', 'Jason', 'Street', 'suffers', 'unfortunate', 'accident', 'leaving', 'paralyzed', 'waist', 'down', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'somehow', 'bring', 'team', 'back', 'make', 'faster', 'stronger', 'new', 'quarterback', 'confidence-lacking', 'Matt', 'Saracen', 'course', 'not', 'everything', 'about', 'football', 'everyone', 'own', 'issues', 'deal', 'such', 'affairs', 'drug', 'taking', 'infights', 'team', 'as', 'well', 'town', 'bitterness', 'team', 'should', 'lose', 'team', 'will', 'have', 'muster', 'everything', 'have', 'make', 'way', 'State', 'Championships.It', 'strange', 'have', 'show', 'not', 'built', 'unique', 'premise', 'such', 'superpowers', 'Heroes', 'man', 'vs', 'machine', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'mystery', 'Lost', 'Instead', 'show', 'football', 'people', 'affected', 'more', 'character-driven', 'rather', 'CG', 'effects', 'action', 'scenes', 'different', 'change', 'pace', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'emphasis', 'acting', 'realistic', 'situations', 'really', 'talented', 'cast', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'playing', 'most', 'realistic', 'couple', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV', 'Minka', 'Kelly', 'sexy-but-smart', 'Lyla', 'Garrity', 'Tyra', 'Collette', 'who', 'not', 'just', 'bad', 'girl', 'sake', 'being', '*****', 'one', 'problem', 'couple', 'characters', 'such', 'Smash', 'Williams', 'who', 'ego', 'bigger', 'field', 'Even', 'more', 'deeper', 'storylines', 'still', 'arrogant', 'kid', 'first', 'see', 'being.My', 'other', 'complaint', 'events', 'transpire', 'episode', 'are', 'great', 'filled', 'nuanced', 'acting', 'believable', 'situations', 'are', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'were', 'obvious', 'episodes', 'Think', 'Should', 'Have', 'Sex', 'where', 'Taylor', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'episode', 'title', 'boyfriend', 'Matt', 'quarterback', 'Mud', 'Bowl', 'where', 'team', 'homemade', 'field', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'remember', 'specific', 'moment', 'such', 'Lyla', 'doing', 'bad***', 'moment', 'car', 'dealership', 'when', 'Tyra', 'mom', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'what', 'episode', 'took', 'place', 'obvious', 'season', 'arc', 'team', 'struggle', 'get', 'State', 'there', 'individual', 'episodes', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'weight', 'what', 'came', 'afterwards.With', 'extras', 'being', 'skimpy', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'tons', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'just', 'feels', 'light', 'least', 'couple', 'commentaries', 'could', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'being', 'bit', 'more', 'heavier', 'extras', 'lovely', 'music', 'band', 'Explosions', 'Sky', 'talented', 'cast', 'premise', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'love', 'get', 'STILL', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'hell', 'play', 'football', 'still', 'show', 'can', 'enjoy']",Friday Night Lights: The First Season

As I read other reviews, I saw that it was only on NBC for one season, and then was picked up by DirecTV. I've concluded that, since it's not rude or crude, but instead is an emotional, heart-felt portrayal of life in a small town, the media decided it wasn't worth their time. Interesting that Kyle Chandler won Best Actor at this year's Emmy awards.Anyhow, after every episode I find myself saying ""I love this show."" I love the stories of the families, I love that each episode builds on the previous episode, and I especially love watching the chemistry and interaction between the coach (Kyle Chandler) and his wife (Connie Britton). The writing is exceptional--what a true-life picture of the struggles, compromises, defeats and victories encountered in a marriage and in life itself.

This first season features excellent acting and some of the most compelling television available on network television.  The show revolves around a high school football team in the small town of Dillon, Texas.  The coach and central figure is varsity coach Eric Taylor, played by Kyle Chandler.  Coach Taylor's family is featured prominently, as the family is linked to each of the team's players and their families.The first season features 22 episodes that introduce us to the trials and tribulations of the players, their families, and the football team.  I found myself standing up and rooting for the Dillon Panthers during game sequences as if I was watching a live game.  The scenes are that good.  Even though high school football is a central theme in the series, you do not have to be a sports fan to enjoy this series.Fortunately the show has been renewed so that this DVD can be enjoyed along with new episodes.

Shows with this much heart, superb acting, fantastic chemistry and incredible writing are few and far between on the television these days. It's just too bad that people think it's all about football.While the show does feature a football team, or more specifically, the Dillon High School Panthers, the show is about so much more than just what happens on a field. It captures the lives of people in the small Texas town of Dillon and how football or the football team affects their lives. In a place where football is king, everybody is touched in one way or another by the local football team.But, the show explores so much more than football, delving into the personal lives of the players, the new coach and his family and all the other people in town. It deals with complex issues, yet knows when to  insert the light moments that are always a part of life. There is no doubt that this show captures real life better than anything on television in the last few years.FNL follows coach Eric Taylor (the perfectly-cast Kyle Chandler) as he takes over the Panthers after years as an assistant coach. He has a talented running back Smash Williams (Gaius Charles), a star quarterback Jason Street (Scott Porter) and a hard living full back Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch). However, he also has the expectations of the entire town on his shoulders, as everyone from the guy at the grocery store to the mayor has an opinion on how the team should be run, what plays should be used and more. The townspeople view this as their team and Coach Taylor is faced with balancing the wishes and needs of an entire community with what he knows is right for his team.Things go horribly wrong in the first game of the season, the very first episode, when the star quarterback is paralyzed in an on-field incident, leaving the team in the hands of the quiet, shy backup quarterback, Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford). From there, viewers are drawn into the story of the Dillon Panthers and the people who cheer them on.Coach Taylor and his wife Tammi (Connie Britton, who was also in the FNL movie) see their relationship put through some tests as the coach works through tough times with his team. However, it is her steadiness that keeps him going and helps him find a way through the hard times. Their daughter Julie (Aimee Teegarden) also becomes a handful as she enters her sophomore year in high school.After being paralyzed, Street faces many critical choices as he fights to maintain some semblance of a life. His longtime girlfriend, cheerleader Lyla Garrity (the gorgeous Minka Kelly) stands by his side through the first part of his injury, but finds herself succumbing to the bad boy Riggins, who himself is having a hard time dealing with the injury to his teammate and best friend. The Lyla-Riggins storyline takes a tough turn when Jason finds out and stops talking to both of them. While the three eventually get back to talking, their relationship may never be the same.Riggins has his own issues to deal with, as he lives with his brother thanks to his not present parents. He is constantly drinking and seemingly throwing his life away. The only place he feels complete is between the lines on Friday night. His relationship with Lyla also screws up the ""relationship""  he had with Tyra Collette (Adrianne Palicki), a union that was rocky at best to begin with.As the new starting quarterback, Saracen finds himself in a place he is not comfortable, at the center of attention. The shy young man works hard on the field and off, taking care of his grandmother while his father is in Iraq. The return of Mr. Saracen provides a good storyline for Matt, who finds that things are almost easier without him there and when the elder Saracen returns to Iraq, Matt goes back to the fulltime care of his grandmother, who is seemingly dealing with worsening dementia. Perhaps the most touching storyline involves Matt and Julie, the coach's daughter, as they explore their blossoming relationship under the watchful eyes of Coach Taylor and the entire community. Matt also leans on his best friend, Landry Clarke (Jesse Plemons) for advice of all kinds, much of which is questionable at best.The end of the season provides a glimpse at a relationship between Landry and Tyra, one that finds the two actors working a lot together and the chemistry is absolutely perfect. While the way the story is take to start season two is questionable, nobody can deny the chemistry between these two characters. They deserved the chance to shine and they got it.A simple review like this can't even begin to touch on all the storylines and issues that cropped up in season one. From domestic violence to teen relationships, from alcohol abuse to adultery, this show touches on major issues in society and deals with them in a way that makes it absolutely impossible to stop watching.The DVD set contains a number of deleted scenes and a great behind the scenes look at making the first season. The set I purchased also came with a money back guarantee, which tells the viewer that the people in charge believe in this show.I was hooked on Friday Night Lights from the opening credits of the first episode and this DVD set brought me right back to them and I found it tough to not watch five or six episodes at a time when the clock was pushing midnight. This is a phenomenal show and a great DVD set and anybody who thinks that television isn't what it used to be needs to check this show out.",5,Television doesn't get much better than

I'm not a fan of the movie, football, and generally I'm not a fan of dramas involving high school students.  But that isn't what Friday Night Lights is about.  FNL is about life and choices, struggles and celebrations.Friday Night Lights will melt the coldest, most skeptical heart if you give it a chance. Simply put, it captures the true essence of not only small Texas football towns, but also the very bonds that tie people together.  You will feel a part of the Taylor family.  You're best friend will be Matt Saracen or Julie Taylor.  You'll smile, laugh, and cry because the cast and show are so in sync with character development that they literally jump out of the screen and become a part of your life.This is because of the freedom of movement the producers give the actors.  The cameras and characters flow freely without rehersals, performing their roles passionately.  As a result, you experience not merely a televised performance but a literal mirror into another world.  From the opening soundtrack to the closing credits everything comes so natural: the music, scene, and people are so authentic it literally breaks primetime telivision molds.Ultimately, this is the reason why it's run will be short-lived.

1081238,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000RF1QE2,Kevin Killian,"[1, 1]","I teach at an art school here in San Francisco and last semester one of my students (hi Kate) kept plugging this show, saying it was the best show on TV, she even wrote a paper analyzing it and in general propounding Friday Night Lights as one of the great art spectacles of our day and eventually, at Christmastime, I gave in and started watching the first season on DVD.  Well, I had read the original nonfiction book back when it first came out and I admired it, but I was thinking, a whole show based on that book would be depressing with a capital D.  Suffice it to say that after the pilot I was hooked, and so was my wife (who hates sports and hates sports shows even more).  It was like a Christmas miracle on Minna Street.  Now that we have watched the whole of season one, I can happily say that, we are wondering how to contain our impatience until the second season gets boxed up.  Especially with the writers strike which seems to mean that season two will end at 13 episodes.Oh well, I forgot to mention that pundits claim that, like HEROES, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS took a dramatic and misjudged turn early on in season two which led to fans' outrage.  I wonder what it could be!  People said that melodrama had come to Dillon High School.  Well, season one was entirely about melodrama so how bad could it be?The hardest thing to believe in FNL is that Jason Street is in high school.  The actor who plays him is talented, sort of, but he's got to be thirty if he's a day!  I know that the Texas sun could age a person and that Lady Bird Johnson looked thirty when she was a mere girl, but come on, this guy is supposed to be 17 and he could be playing a teacher at the school.  Most of the other kids seem roughly of high school age, so Jason Street stands out for sure.  In fact the girl who plays Julie seems sometimes as though she were 11 or 12, when she decides she wants to explore her sexuality I felt like the show was moving into Lolita country here.Everyone is fantastically beautiful.  But that's probably exactly right.  I have only been to Texas a few times but everyone *was* beautiful, though in a slightly different vein than the actors on FNL.  Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton, come on!  There isn't a better looking couple on TV and Kyle in particular is like Tom Brady in looks, you just want to shut your eyes and capture that steeljawed magnetism forever, especially when he's mad at a player.  The one who's on the plain side is Grandma Saracen, but then the poor actress is hampered by having to play the part like she's just about to slide into Alzheimer's Disease, and she's only 42.  She's close to the real life age of Jason Street, and you can tell she has no idea of how a real life elderly woman would respond in the stupid situations they dream up for her.That scene where Matt has to pretend he's his own grandfather and sing ""Mr Sandman"" to his grandma to calm her down was just about the dumbest thing I've seen on TV in generations.  But then why do I give it five stars?  Because it has a fresh, hand held vigor that distinguishes itself immediately from most TV shows.  The storylines aren't too byzantine, and if cliches pop up from time to time (whenever two cheaters kiss they are always immediately observed by the person who would get most upset), the honest dramatic acting sort of obscures these flaws.  Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose.",5,Can't Lose,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,3397,"['teach', 'art', 'school', 'here', 'San', 'Francisco', 'last', 'semester', 'one', 'students', 'hi', 'Kate', 'kept', 'plugging', 'show', 'saying', 'was', 'best', 'show', 'TV', 'even', 'wrote', 'paper', 'analyzing', 'general', 'propounding', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'one', 'great', 'art', 'spectacles', 'day', 'eventually', 'Christmastime', 'gave', 'started', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'Well', 'had', 'read', 'original', 'nonfiction', 'book', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'admired', 'was', 'thinking', 'whole', 'show', 'based', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'depressing', 'capital', 'D.', 'Suffice', 'say', 'pilot', 'was', 'hooked', 'so', 'was', 'wife', 'who', 'sports', 'hates', 'sports', 'shows', 'even', 'more', 'was', 'Christmas', 'miracle', 'Minna', 'Street', 'Now', 'have', 'watched', 'whole', 'season', 'one', 'can', 'happily', 'say', 'are', 'wondering', 'how', 'contain', 'impatience', 'second', 'season', 'boxed', 'up', 'Especially', 'writers', 'strike', 'mean', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'end', '13', 'episodes.Oh', 'well', 'forgot', 'mention', 'pundits', 'claim', 'HEROES', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'took', 'dramatic', 'misjudged', 'turn', 'early', 'season', 'two', 'led', 'fans', 'outrage', 'wonder', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'People', 'said', 'melodrama', 'had', 'come', 'Dillon', 'High', 'School', 'Well', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'entirely', 'melodrama', 'so', 'how', 'bad', 'could', 'be', 'hardest', 'thing', 'believe', 'FNL', 'Jason', 'Street', 'high', 'school', 'actor', 'who', 'talented', 'sort', 'got', 'be', 'thirty', 'day', 'know', 'Texas', 'sun', 'could', 'age', 'person', 'Lady', 'Bird', 'Johnson', 'looked', 'thirty', 'when', 'was', 'mere', 'girl', 'come', 'guy', 'supposed', 'be', '17', 'could', 'be', 'playing', 'teacher', 'school', 'Most', 'other', 'kids', 'seem', 'roughly', 'high', 'school', 'age', 'Jason', 'Street', 'out', 'sure', 'fact', 'girl', 'who', 'Julie', 'sometimes', 'were', '11', '12', 'when', 'explore', 'sexuality', 'felt', 'show', 'was', 'moving', 'Lolita', 'country', 'here.Everyone', 'fantastically', 'beautiful', 'probably', 'exactly', 'right', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'Texas', 'few', 'times', 'everyone', '*was*', 'beautiful', 'though', 'slightly', 'different', 'vein', 'actors', 'FNL', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'come', ""n't"", 'better', 'looking', 'couple', 'TV', 'Kyle', 'particular', 'Tom', 'Brady', 'looks', 'just', 'want', 'shut', 'eyes', 'capture', 'steeljawed', 'magnetism', 'forever', 'especially', 'when', 'mad', 'player', 'one', 'who', 'plain', 'side', 'Grandma', 'Saracen', 'then', 'poor', 'actress', 'hampered', 'having', 'play', 'part', 'just', 'about', 'slide', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', 'only', '42', 'close', 'real', 'life', 'age', 'Jason', 'Street', 'can', 'tell', 'idea', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'elderly', 'woman', 'would', 'respond', 'stupid', 'situations', 'dream', 'up', 'her.That', 'scene', 'where', 'Matt', 'pretend', 'own', 'grandfather', 'sing', 'Mr', 'Sandman', 'grandma', 'calm', 'down', 'was', 'just', 'dumbest', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV', 'generations', 'then', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'fresh', 'hand', 'held', 'vigor', 'immediately', 'most', 'TV', 'shows', 'storylines', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'byzantine', 'cliches', 'pop', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'whenever', 'two', 'cheaters', 'kiss', 'are', 'always', 'immediately', 'observed', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'get', 'most', 'upset', 'honest', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'sort', 'obscures', 'flaws', 'Clear', 'eyes', 'full', 'hearts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lose']",Friday Night Lights: The First Season

It's a refreshing change from all the cop and murder mystery shows out there and I look forward to this each week.  It stars the gorgeous Kyle Chandler (from Early Edition) who plays Eric Taylor, the newly appointed head coach to the high school in Dillon, Texas (Dillon High School Panthers) and Connie Britton (who I remember from Spin City) as his wife.The show expands on the hit movie of the same name.  It focuses mainly on the team and the coach who is feeling the pressure of the town's pride and honor riding on his shoulders to make the team the best they can be and be successful.I love the episode Best Laid Plans where Coach Taylor has to make his decision to maybe take another job and Jason moves into a new apartment and also Git'er Done where Jason is still unaware that his best friend is spending a lot of time with his girlfriend.I love the theme of team spirit and pulling together as a team on their way to victory.

Like all of the most incredible tv, this show is about people - character-driven drama at it's absolute finest.  The boring, boooorrring pilot episode shows us each character as a stereotype - who we might see them as if we were, say, outsiders who might not think too highly of the pampered Texas football stars and the locals who have nothing better to do on a Friday night than go watch a high school football game.  And, frankly, you just won't give a darn.  (Although I'm a tv addict, even I fell asleep during the pilot.)But then, each character grows.  And each character has such flaws.  And such conviction.  And you get to SEE them.  Really see them, and what you find is depth and strength and courage and weakness.  The show faces issues boldly without beating us over the head with them (race, gender, prejudice, rape, etc.), providing a forum to express the issues that Americans face everyday.  And though some of these issues are heavy, the tone of the show is one of strength in overcoming adversity.  Of challenges overcome and the power in forgiveness and in doing what is right rather than what is easy.  The team motto says it all:"" ""Clear Eyes.  Full hearts.

You just can't go wrong.I think that if prices were always so low, more of us would experiment and get DVD sets of shows we wouldn't normally get. That would open us up to more novel and interesting viewing experiences, and we might discover some great gems in the process.My note to studios - Please follow this lead and mark down your DVDs, please. DVDs are not too expensive to make, for years we have been ripped off by paying too much for it. I read on a forum recently that a 6-Disc DVD set would actually only cost about $8 to make (DVD cost included).My note to viewers - even if you're not sure, get this show simply because of the low price.

1081255,APOUYO1BEPK22,B000RF1QE2,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[10, 10]","I got into this show for 2 reasons. The first one is I love football. The second one is that I loved the movie.Now I didn't think this show was going to be nearly as good as the movie, since it's not based on a true story and it's on a TV budget... not a movie budget. But I still wanted to give it a try. And man am I glad I did. Friday Night Lights is MUCH more than just some dumb football show. Yes it does have football and yes it's centered on football, but in all honesty, it feels like football is just a secondary to the great story that we have going on right before our eyes.Coach Eric Taylor has taken the reigns as the new head coach of The Dillon Panthers football team. QB#1 Jason Street is the golden boy on the team. He's supposedly one of the best quarterbacks that's ever been seen (according to Notre Dame at least). A close second to Jason would be Brian `Smash' Williams. The star running back that can actually back up the big mouth he has. Smash is also a star player that WILL be going somewhere someday. The Panthers are littered with talent in other spots as well, but a curveball is thrown to them in their first game of the season and Jason Street has to leave the game only to be replaced by the somewhat shy Matthew Saracen. Can Saracen help lead the team and win them and Coach Taylor the first game of the season? Well, watch the show and find out...hehe.Coach Taylor is played by Kyle Chandler. His wife Tami is played by Connie Britton. I seriously do not think they are even acting when you see these two together. I completely forget I'm watching actors. They meld together so seamlessly you would think they are actually married. You can see the love in their eyes when they talk to each other on just little things like grocery shopping. You can see the hurt in their eyes when one of them slips up with the wrong thing said. You can see the irritation in their actions of having to explain themselves to one another because they've been together for so long. And even though they have their faults... they have the type of relationship most of us look forward to having one day (hopefully). Julie Taylor, their daughter, is played by the ever so cute Aimee Teegarden. She is perfectly matched with her parents. Even though she acts a little to smart for britches (like my grandpa used to say), she is still a really good daughter... who Matthew Saracen has a secret crush on. It's great to watch this high school romance happen between the two. It seems almost real to me. Saracen always starts to talk, only to come out with half sentences before she walks off, because he can barely keep his head straight when she's around... lol... I love it. These two relationships on camera work so well that you really do just fall back into high school again as a teenager. Plus, and boy have I been there, the relationship between Coach Taylor and Matthew Saracen has to be some of the funniest stuff to watch. Poor Matt gets in from Coach on AND off the field.That's only two things I love about this show with much more going on that I won't really go into great detail. But you have Tim Riggins who is the `misunderstood bad boy'. Sounds pretty clich&eacute; but it he pulls it off pretty darn well. Then you have Lyla Garrity, the beautiful (and oh is she ever) cheerleader/church girl that is going to marry Jason Street one day. She's slowly being pushed away by Jason because of what he's going through. Her life and future is changing drastically, and sadly, around her. Tyra Collete is, what I'm thinking at least, the school bad girl (drinking and sex of course). Her home living is a mess due to her mom and her school life is bad because she's always with Tim Riggins and she's just doesn't care about school. Or so we think. Another funny character is Landry Clarke, the best friend of Saracen. Just about every part he's in has me laughing.Friday Night Lights deal with a lot of high school issues such as love, sex, family, drugs, and friendships. The one thing that I just did NOT care for AT ALL was the few episodes on racism. A friend of mine said the same exact thing to me the other day when he got done watching the show. That's the only thing I just did not like at all about this show. It seemed like it had no actual ground to be brought up. Like it was forced on us. And it was basically one coach vs. all the black kids (kids... not parents) on the team. It was completely idiotic and just seemed out of place. Ah well.I thought the show was going to be cancelled after the second season, but thankfully it's still alive and made it into the third season. I just don't see how TV execs can cancel such a good show when they don't even have any idea of where to put it on TV. The first time was up against American Idol (I believe)... and the second time is on Friday Night. Um. Don't you think your main targeted audience would be OUT on Friday Night watching high school football games or going out and hanging out with friends? Hmmm... smart thinking TV execs.As for this DVD set, it's got some good extras on it, according to my friend. Sorry I haven't gotten around to them yet. But for 20 bucks... this is a STEAL of a deal.Support Friday Night Lights.

1081260,A1VPZBI9YA8ZDC,B000RF1QE2,Moving Pictures Gen,"[0, 0]","Friday Night Lights is much more then a high school football team sports drama.  It&#8217;s about the state of Texas, about family life, about trust, about racism, about gays, about crime, about those with and without a family, and it&#8217;s about the College Sport Football Scholarship Machine that spits out and cuts the injured, even the slightly injured, and those not quite ready to make the college lineup.  It&#8217;s about corruption and trust, and the good guys don&#8217;t always win.NBC attempted to correct its early marketing efforts that exclusively targeted a male high school student audience after the series&#8217; first season by aggressively targeting teenage females, but the damage had been done, and females and others were turned off by the Friday Night Light&#8217;s early weighty high school football marketing appeal.If you are an East Coast Liberal you may be surprised to find yourself admiring Coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler the boss of the family) and his wife Tami Taylor (Connie Britton-who is really the boss of the family unbeknownst to husband Coach Taylor) and their conservative and probably very Republican Party outlook.It&#8217;s a sprinkling of &#8220;you alls&#8221;, and everything that goes along with a good deal of cleavage illustrating that everything is big in Texas, including football.  If you are an East Coast Liberal you may find yourself understanding your conservative counter part and what really makes him and her tick.  You will attend both black and white churches, and in a series of episodes see the effects of polar disorder on one teenager, and how it ends her boyfriend-girl friend relationship.Values explored are not all black or white, but shades of gray, with subjects such as premarital teen sex, binge drinking, infidelity, black on white teenage dating, high school clicks, &#8220;Rally Girls&#8221; doing a football players homework, Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease, attempted suicide, and in one episode, a crooked American doctor practicing dangerous medicine in Mexico.  All of this is presented against a backdrop of poverty and high unemployment, as well as a schools real budget woes in a small rural town that lives only for football.What happens to the &#8220;left behinds&#8221;, the teenager who is just out of the reformatory, the teenager who finds &#8220;Jesus&#8221;, the teenager who becomes a paraplegic, the teenager who is homeless, the teenager who is the only caretaker for his grandmother who has Alzheimer&#8217;s.  It&#8217;s a hundred stories bundled into one and sometimes they throw in a little football, which really serves as a carry all for the rest of the themes.  Many episodes lack any football at all.I&#8217;m only into my third season and have to discipline my self to watch only one episode at a time. And I really don&#8217;t like sports at all; my conclusion being that the real national sport is catching the players doing something illegal.  Unfortunately Sports are no longer about a player winning the game.  Friday Night Lights however is real.

Because of the humanizing way this show portrays the sport and the lives of each of the young players, my wife understands more about football, how it is played, and the kinds of men that play and coach the game.

1081275,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000RF1QE2,Robert Moore,"[161, 179]","HELP SAVE THIS SERIES! February 8, 2008 -- There is an extremely good chance that this evening's season finale (the decision not to make any more episodes for Season Two has apparently already been made) could be the last episode of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS forever.  Unless fans get involved.  There are things we can do to save this, which is still one of the two best series on network television (I have to include PUSHING DAISIES on the best of the best list -- the other greatest shows on TV are on cable, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, THE WIRE, and MAD MEN).  Here on Amazon you can do either of two things.  One, you can watch individual episodes of the show on Unbox.  Two, you can buy Season One on DVD.  Hey, it's only $18.99!  That is the cost of a large pizza with three toppings!  The other thing you can do is to go to any online FNL websites (either the official board on [...] or just about anywhere else -- Google it -- and find out about letter writing campaigns.  Fans last year saved what is quite frankly a pretty average show, JERICHO, from cancellation.  Surely the same can be done of one the most brilliant shows on TV.  Although NBC president Ben Silverman seems intent on cancelling the show, there is a legitimate chance that it could reappear on another network (come on CW!  it would instantly be your best show by a gigantic margin!).  I'll revise this as developments occur.Warning!  Some spoilers are contained in the following review.So many of my favorite shows seem afflicted with names that make nonviewers dismiss them without actually watching them.  Based on the name alone or the most superficial knowledge of the show, they feel they known enough to ignore them.  I've had a tremendous time convincing people that BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is not only not silly, but one of the most intelligent shows in the history of television.  Likewise, I've struggled telling people who I know love quality television that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA has nothing in common with the old Lorne Greene/Dirk Benedict cheesefest and instead is a television masterpiece that even someone who hates Sci-fi would love.  And so now I have, largely without success, tried my hardest to get my TV-savvy friends to grasp a very simple fact:  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS really isn't about football.  Yes, there is some football in it, but like BUFFY and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, this is a television series that utterly defies expectations.  All three shows are more about people and the decisions they make.  The vampires, the space ships, and the football are just window dressing.With the possible exception of LOST (which is fully back on track after a shaky Season Three start), FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is the best series on network television (though I would add that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and THE WIRE are at least as good, but BSG is on the Sci-fi Channel and THE WIRE on HBO).  It came terribly close to being cancelled due to absolutely horrible ratings but managed to survive for a very simple reason:  it is a stunningly great show.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS represents television at its finest, a show as good as the very best that TV has produced in the past decade.  It belongs alongside BUFFY, THE SOPRANOS, THE WEST WING, SIX FEET UNDER, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, and other shows of that quality.  There were other very good shows to debut in 2006-2007 such as UGLY BETTY, HEROES, DEXTER, and MEN IN TREES, but FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is easily the best of those shows.  It received critical acclaim and accolades unusual for a network series with such dismal ratings and perhaps its lone chance of survival past Season Two lies in its performance at the Emmys.  I could be wrong, but my gut tells me that this could be one of those shows that finally wins an audience by the awards it will win.  I think there is an extremely good chance that FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS will win the Emmy for Best Dramatic Series and that perhaps two or three acting awards will be picked up by its actors.  I would lay even money that Kyle Chandler will win Best Actor in a Dramatic Series while Connie Britton will certainly receive a Best Actress nomination and deserves to win.  On the supporting actor and actress side, I wouldn't be surprised if three or four additional performers received nominations, especially Zach Gilford for his portrayal of sophomore quarterback Matt Saracen, Adrianne Palicki as sometimes bad girl Tyra Collette, and Minka Kelly for her remarkable, nuanced, and compelling job as Lyla Garrity.  And to be fair, there are three or four others who should receive consideration.  This is simply the most talented cast on television.  There are many, many reasons to watch this show and the quality of the acting is one of those reasons.If you have not seen FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS repeat the following mantra over and over until you come to believe it:  ""This show is not about football.  This show is not about football.  This show is not about football.""  To be honest, if this show was about football I wouldn't watch it.  It is about people struggling to live their lives.  Take Matt Saracen.  As the sophomore backup to the team's star quarterback he didn't go into the season to play much if at all.  But after Jason Street, the team's greatest star, goes down with a crippling injury, he has to assume a job he is not prepared to take on.  Meanwhile, he has to continue to care for his grandmother who is suffering from mild dementia and requires a great deal of care.  His father, who is serving in the army in Iraq, is able to provide little direct assistance.  And if his life isn't complicated enough, he is deeply attracted to the coach's daughter Julie (with yet another marvelous acting job handed in by Aimee Teegarden).  Meanwhile, Matt struggles to keep friendships alive as he finds football success, which creates tensions with his musically astute Christian nerd friend (and member of a Christian hardcore rock band).  Yet another mark of the show's brilliance is that Landry Clarke, his friend, is not presented as in any way a simplistic character (and again, he is wonderfully played by Jesse Plemons).  He isn't one of your stock nerds nor is he in any way a stereotyped Christian.  He is literate, intelligent, socially awkward, and a really caring, compassionate friend.  His awkward attempted courtship of the party girl Tyra is one of many wonderful wrinkles in the season.There are so many things to praise about this show that one could almost not come to an end.  But clearly at the heart of the show is the Taylor family.  I find this the most believable and compelling television family that I have ever seen.  Coach Taylor is not a perfect person, but he is a wise one, fully capable of admitting his mistakes.  His wife Tami (I did mention how extraordinary Connie Britton is in this role, didn't I?) is fully his equal on every level.  She is smart, insightful, empathetic, caring, and implacable.  With their daughter Julie they form a family that feels so real that at times you truly don't feel that you are watching actors performing but magically eavesdropping on a real life family.  There are many scenes between Coach Taylor, his wife, and Julie that left me agog and asking myself, ""Was that really acting?""Another pole around which the show is constructed concerns attempt of Jason Street and his girlfriend Lyla to come to terms with his serious spinal injury, which leaves him without the use of his legs.  If there is one bit of unreality to the show it is the speed with which Jason adjusts to having suffered such a serious injury.  I understand why they did this.  It would have been tedious to stretch Jason's adjusting to being a paraplegic over a couple of seasons.  Instead, they took a process that should have taken over a year and shrank it for dramatic purposes to two or three months.  But the emotions and dilemmas that his injury creates for both Jason and Lyla make wonderful television.I simply don't have room to mention all the wonderful characters on the show.  Even mentioning only briefly characters like Lyla's father (and president of the booster club), Jason's best friend Tim Riggins, star running back Brian 'Smash' Williams,  or the minister's intelligent but bipolar daughter Noannie Williams doesn't do justice to all the wonderful performers on this show.Nor do I have time to do justice to how intelligently this show is written.  Even though it takes up themes that a host of other shows have dealt with, it always manages to do so freshly and innovatively.  The finest example is the episode that deals with the fallout from some crudely racist remarks made by an assistant coach.  The controversy builds to the point where it appears that all the black players will quit the team unless the coach is fired.  I won't spoil the resolution, but the episode ends with one of my favorite moments in the entire 2006-2007 season.If there are two series currently running that I could make anyone and everyone watch, simply because they are so extraordinarily good, they are FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  There are so many similarities between the two shows.  Both have huge and talented ensemble casts.  Both are brilliantly written.  Both are filmed using handheld cameras and have a gritty, documentary feel to them.  And both defy all the expectations people have formed in thinking that they don't want to see them.  Both these series represent television at its very best.  Please do both yourself and this show a favor:  watch it.In closing, I have to point out that one of the problems the show had in its first season was that no one knew when it was on.  The problem is the title.  NBC didn't want to put it on Fridays because that night is considered the kiss of death.  But the fact is that it is probably the only night they could ever schedule it.  No matter what they do everyone is going to assume it broadcasts on a Friday.  So, NBC surrendered to the inevitable and placed it on their Friday schedule.  Tune in and watch it!  And kudos to NBC!  Without any serious competition NBC has emerged as the leading purveyor of quality entertainment on television.  The irony is that they rank fourth in viewership.  CBS, with absolutely no critically acclaimed shows, ranks first.  With other networks willing to pull the plug on a show regardless of their critical acclaim (such as the CW killing their only critically acclaimed series, VERONICA MARS), I tremendously admire NBC for sticking with this and other excellent shows that may not get the greatest ratings.  Let's just all pray that the outstanding series gets the viewership it so richly deserves.NBC Universal seems to be doing their part to increase the popularity of the series.  Many series retail for as much as $89.99 before discounting down to a lower figure, while the standard retail price for most series is around $59.95.  But they are offering FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS initially at $29.99 and only $19.99 after Amazon's discount.  No other show that I have ever heard of starts off at a price this low.  It truly is unprecedented.  To my mind they are making us an offer that we can't refuse.",5,Simply the best series on network television,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,11153,"['HELP', 'SAVE', 'THIS', 'SERIES', 'February', '8',

The plan of the producers was obviously to make the show more ""realistic"" by doing the extreme close-ups and the like, but they failed heavily.For my money, I refuse to care about the aforementioned criticisms of this show because I feel that my criticism of this show should be the only reason why people dislike this show. In my view, the most obvious affront of FNL is how it disparagingly stereotypes red-state Texans!!!! Whether it's their Christian religion, their southern accents, their passion for football, or their small-town folksiness, white, Christian Americans are being ridiculed in this show because FNL is an elitist show made by Hollywood liberals. In fact, the only reason this show is so popular among critics (read: liberal shills who vote Democrat) is because it reinforces, in its discriminatory stereotyping, the views of liberals on the coast of people in red-state, ""flyover states.""Here are some abominable examples of abusive, liberal-elitist stereotyping in FNL's 1st season.First and foremost is the way many of the actors absolutely parody the southern accent of their characters. Lyla Garrity sounds like a bimbo-ish airhead with her perkiness. The Matt Saracen (does anyone know Saracen means ""Arab"" or ""Muslim""; how PC can you get!) and Landry characters epitomize what liberals on the coast think of Southerners. This is demonstrated inarguably by the way the actors have their characters speak in their southern drawls. Matt's always insecure and like ""Uuuuuh, hi there J-J-Julie (Coach Taylor's daughter)!"" His best buddy, Landry, relentlessly utters lines like ""Uuuuuh, h-h-hi there, Tyra. D-d-do you want suuum help wit dat?"" The point is that the liberal actors intentionally speak their southern accents to make Texans look as inbred, dumb and uncouth as libs stereotype them to be!!!!Another maltreatment is how FNL shows these red-state Texans in social/cultural situations which are often at odds with the Christians they are.For instance, the Lyla character is a Christian as is her dad, Buddy, yet both are written by the liberal writers to be such personal hypocrites with their cheating on their respective significant others. Lyla, of course, cheats with the lowlife miscreant Riggins while her dad is thrown out of the house by his wife after he admits to an affair. These story developments aren't defensible enough to be cited as mere plot devices; it's inarguably blatant that they're meant to derogate Christians as hypocrites, and one can almost imagine the gloating schadenfreude the liberal writers experienced while penning this BS.In criticizing this shabbiness of a TV show, I cannot omit the egregious exaggeration of ""religiosity"" that's skewered by the writers. Again, one can just imagine the sadistic, liberal-slanting writers gloating with malice when they contrive scenes which show the characters in prayer, such as before a big game. The way the mocking writers derogatively portray Texans is almost like the unflattering movie Jesus Camp where Christians are misrepresented as ""Jesus Freaks"" and general radicals. This is irrefutably established in scenes showing characters like Smash and his fat momma praying with their eyes closed and mouths open as if in rapture.Yet another unforgivable trespass is the abuse of the Iraq war veteran (Matt Saracen's father) to make a barely veiled attack against the Iraq war policy!!!! The context of the episode arc featuring Matt's father was to disparagingly mischaracterize Iraq vets as returning to troubled homes without enough money to make ends meet. Viewers WILL remember that Matt's father wanted to move the family out of town because he couldn't afford healthcare for Matt's senile/demented grandma and even took a job as a used car salesman.Completing the lib-elitist stereotypes is an episode dealing with racism where Smash is allegedly defamed by one of the assistant coaches due to his black skin color. Of course, subordinating to the liberal ideology, the assistant coach looks like a bigot full of hatred while Smash is doubtfully portrayed as a courageous ""martyr"" who stands up for his ""rights"" despite the fact that his actions actually hurt his whole team!!!!As I lectured earlier in my thesis, the reason critics (read: liberal agents planted in the media) love FNL is because it reinforces all the demeaning stereotypes of white, red-state, Christian Southerners. FNL questionably depicts all characters in Dillon to be basically white trash from broken homes, white trash who drink and copulate excessively, and white trash who are economically destitute. All the lowest, unflattering tangents are here, whether it's driving pickups or wearing ballcaps or polishing shotguns.",1,"Stereotypes! Come get your Stereotypes!

1081280,A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,B000RF1QE2,Scooter McGavin,"[2, 2]","I thought the first episode of Friday Night Lights was filled with foolball clich&eacute; and outright ripping off Remember the Titans and Varsity Blues.  Fortunately I gave the show another try.  I'm not entirely sure where the turning point was when I went from finding the show clich&eacute;d to being one of the upper tier of great television but I have a feeling it had to do with the greatness of Landry Clarke, Matt Saracen's socially challenged, math loving best friend.Landry isn't the only great character on the show, if fact every character on the show is well crafted, from the cast members right down to the guest stars (well Tyra's mother aside). You end up getting deeply involved with each and every one of them and the camera work and the locations makes you feel like you are actual resident of the town of Dillon, Texas. You are heartbroken when Tyra gets assaulted. You feel the pain when Jason finds out his girlfriend cheated with his girlfriend. Emotions wash over you when Mrs. Taylor confronts her daughter when she finds out she is planning to have sex. And even as clich&eacute;d as most of the games were (how many games did they come from behind from to win on the final play?), you still get the tingles when the games start and are on the edge of your seat when the games inevitably goes down to the wire.Now I am not one to talk about acting because there are actually very few great actors in Hollywood. And most acting awards are given not to the best actor but to the best written characters as great writing can make moderate actors seem like great actors (see Sarah Michelle Gellar in Buffy the Vampire Slayer). With that said, all the award shows that haven't recognize Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton, have instantly lost all credibility, But whenever Chandler and Britton were on screen together I started to smile because I knew something great was coming up. And nobody does the passive aggressive annoyance better than Kyle Chandler, just see any scene he is in with Buddy Garrity.Keep in mind the DVD is bare bones in terms of extra, but still, having the whole season for under twenty dollars is a steal.",5,"Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose",1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,2151,"['thought', 'first', 'episode', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'was', 'filled', 'foolball', 'clich', 'eacute', 'outright', 'ripping', 'off', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'Fortunately', 'gave', 'show', 'try', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'where', 'turning', 'point', 'was', 'when', 'went', 'finding', 'show', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'being', 'one', 'upper', 'tier', 'great', 'television', 'have', 'feeling', 'had', 'do', 'greatness', 'Landry', 'Clarke', 'Matt', 'Saracen', 'socially', 'challenged', 'math', 'loving', 'best', 'friend.Landry', ""n't"", 'only', 'great', 'character', 'show', 'fact', 'character', 'show', 'well', 'crafted', 'cast', 'members', 'right', 'down', 'guest', 'stars', 'well', 'Tyra', 'mother', 'aside', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'deeply', 'involved', 'one', 'camera', 'work', 'locations', 'feel', 'are', 'actual', 'resident', 'town', 'Dillon', 'Texas', 'are', 'heartbroken', 'when', 'Tyra', 'assaulted', 'feel', 'pain', 'when', 'Jason', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'cheated', 'girlfriend', 'Emotions', 'wash', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Taylor', 'daughter', 'when', 'planning', 'have', 'sex', 'even', 'clich', 'eacute', 'most', 'games', 'were', 'how', 'many', 'games', 'did', 'come', 'win', 'final', 'play', 'still', 'get', 'tingles', 'when', 'games', 'start', 'are', 'edge', 'seat', 'when', 'games', 'inevitably', 'down', 'wire.Now', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'talk', 'acting', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'few', 'great', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'acting', 'awards', 'are', 'given', 'not', 'best', 'actor', 'best', 'written', 'characters', 'great', 'writing', 'can', 'make', 'moderate', 'actors', 'seem', 'great', 'actors', 'see', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'said', 'award', 'have', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'have', 'instantly', 'lost', 'credibility', 'whenever', 'Chandler', 'Britton', 'were', 'screen', 'together', 'started', 'smile', 'knew', 'something', 'great', 'was', 'coming', 'up', 'nobody', 'passive', 'aggressive', 'annoyance', 'better', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'just', 'see', 'scene', 'Buddy', 'Garrity.Keep', 'mind', 'DVD', 'bare', 'bones', 'terms', 'extra', 'still', 'having', 'whole', 'season', 'twenty', 'dollars', 'steal']",Friday Night Lights: The First Season

1081286,A2K2MYQGBKVKST,B000RF1QE2,Stanford Gibson,"[3, 3]","3.5 starsI initially avoided this show.  It looked like another tired teen drama set around an improbable string of close football finishes.  I also heard that the pilot included a horrifying injury to a main character and I just did not feel like taking on a long term commitment to a fictional character that would make me sad.  But when my favorite sports columnist (Bill Simmons) took it as his personal quest to keep FNL from getting canceled and pleaded with his readers to check it out I put Season 1 on my Netflix queue.  It turns out I was about half right.  The show is full of gorgeous 25 year olds pretending to be teenagers except for the adult nature of their romantic and sexual relationships.  Ethnic stereotypes are in full swing.  The football games were close (only one was decided with the Panthers on defense during the final possession).  And the injury arc is vesting and difficult.However, three unexpected qualities of this show make it not only watchable but engaging.1. At the center of the cast is one of the healthiest, most inspiring marriages I've encountered in visual media in some time.  Coach Taylor and his wife challenge each other, respect each other, admit fault, banter playfully and work hard to keep it interesting.  As a partnership of two very strong personalities they believably fight often but they also fight well, rarely overstepping the boundaries of respect and always coming to a place of self evaluation.  They serve as a moral center for the kids of the school and many in the community.  Both actors embody their characters in believable and compelling ways and I was completely vested in them before I was vested in the team or the series.2. Much has been made of the ubiquitous unsteady cam.  I have no opinion on this.  I find it neither artistically overwhelming nor particularly distracting.  But it is not the artistic center of this show.  I appreciate art that can convey a sense of place, capturing details that unveil the beauty of particularity that makes a community home to some (e.g. Steinbeck or Garden State).  It is obvious that this series has been filmed with the artistic eye of a very good film maker.  Particularly when Texas montages are used to transition between scenes, you get the sense that `Dillon, Texas' is at once sad and beautiful and, though foreign in its dissimilarity, it is fundamentally the same as the place I grew up or the place I now live.3. Finally, the character of Matt Serecen is so endearing that he almost makes the series worth following by himself.  The suddenly promoted backup quarterback is a quirky, artistic `sophomore' with very adult responsibilities.  FNL is most interesting when he and/or the Taylors are on screen.  He and his friend Landry (a Matt Damon look-alike in the `school geek' role, but I digress) have 80% of the laugh out loud lines in the season.So, while, like most teen dramas, I feel a bit creepy watching FNL, there was enough actual substance and art here to keep me watching and to allow me to recommend it.",4,Teen Drama with Watchable Qualities,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,3043,"['3.5', 'starsI', 'initially', 'avoided', 'show', 'looked', 'tired', 'teen', 'drama', 'set', 'improbable', 'string', 'close', 'football', 'finishes', 'also', 'heard', 'pilot', 'included', 'horrifying', 'injury', 'main', 'character', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'taking', 'long', 'term', 'commitment', 'fictional', 'character', 'would', 'make', 'sad', 'when', 'favorite', 'sports', 'columnist', 'Bill', 'Simmons', 'took', 'personal', 'quest', 'keep', 'FNL', 'getting', 'canceled', 'pleaded', 'readers', 'check', 'out', 'put', 'Season', '1', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'out', 'was', 'half', 'right', 'show', 'full', 'gorgeous', '25', 'year', 'olds', 'pretending', 'be', 'teenagers', 'adult', 'nature', 'romantic', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'Ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'full', 'swing', 'football', 'games', 'were', 'close', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'decided', 'Panthers', 'defense', 'final', 'possession', 'injury', 'arc', 'vesting', 'difficult.However', 'three', 'unexpected', 'qualities', 'show', 'make', 'not', 'only', 'watchable', 'engaging.1', 'center', 'cast', 'one', 'healthiest', 'most', 'inspiring', 'marriages', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'visual', 'media', 'time', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'wife', 'challenge', 'other', 'respect', 'other', 'admit', 'fault', 'banter', 'playfully', 'work', 'hard', 'keep', 'interesting', 'partnership', 'two', 'very', 'strong', 'personalities', 'believably', 'fight', 'often', 'also', 'fight', 'well', 'rarely', 'overstepping', 'boundaries', 'respect', 'always', 'coming', 'place', 'self', 'evaluation', 'serve', 'moral', 'center', 'kids', 'school', 'many', 'community', 'actors', 'embody', 'characters', 'believable', 'compelling', 'ways', 'was', 'completely', 'vested', 'was', 'vested', 'team', 'series.2', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'ubiquitous', 'unsteady', 'cam', 'have', 'opinion', 'find', 'artistically', 'overwhelming', 'particularly', 'distracting', 'not', 'artistic', 'center', 'show', 'appreciate', 'can', 'convey', 'sense', 'place', 'capturing', 'details', 'unveil', 'beauty', 'particularity', 'community', 'home', 'e.g', 'Steinbeck', 'Garden', 'State', 'obvious', 'series', 'been', 'filmed', 'artistic', 'eye', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'maker', 'Particularly', 'when', 'Texas', 'montages', 'are', 'used', 'transition', 'scenes', 'get', 'sense', 'Dillon', 'Texas', 'once', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'though', 'foreign', 'dissimilarity', 'fundamentally', 'same', 'place', 'grew', 'up', 'place', 'now', 'live.3', 'Finally', 'character', 'Matt', 'Serecen', 'so', 'endearing', 'almost', 'series', 'following', 'suddenly', 'promoted', 'backup', 'quarterback', 'quirky', 'artistic', 'sophomore', 'very', 'adult', 'responsibilities', 'FNL', 'most', 'interesting', 'when', 'and/or', 'Taylors', 'are', 'screen', 'friend', 'Landry', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'look-alike', 'school', 'geek', 'role', 'digress', 'have', '80', '%', 'laugh', 'loud', 'lines', 'season.So', 'most', 'teen', 'dramas', 'feel', 'bit', 'creepy', 'watching', 'FNL', 'was', 'enough', 'actual', 'substance', 'art', 'here', 'keep', 'watching', 'allow', 'recommend']",Friday Night Lights: The First Season

1081295,AP3B615GM191G,B000RF1QE2,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","There are two kinds of TV dramas: Those that primarily make you think, and those that primarily make you feel.  If you are drawn towards the ""feeling"" type, then ""Friday Night Lights"" should rocket to the top of your TV-watching list.For a basic plot summary, ""FNL"" tells the story of Dillon, TX, primarily focusing on the high school football team so revered by the community.  When a new coach is hired and the star QB goes down via injury, the team is tested on the field as never before.  But off the field, a cauldron of other issues exist (all somehow tied into the football team) that shapes and molds all the citizens of Dillon.The easy criticism of this show is that it is unrealistic in its portrayal of over-the-top football action, teenage sexual relationships, and just an overall level of drama that might seem a tad overblown in light of reality.  While those criticisms are most certainly valid, ""FNL"" overcomes them with a steady dose of the one ""X-factor"" that can cure a lot of dramatic ills: heart.The showed is keyed by four ""main characters"": Coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler), wife Tami (Connie Britton), daughter Julie (Aimee Teegarden), and new starting quarterback Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford), who just happens to be Julie's boyfriend.  Those four characters provide a solid emotional backbone to the show, touching on issues that are quite realistic and emotions that are familiar to all viewers.  When these four characters are on the screen in any combination, ""Friday Night Lights"" is at its very best.""FNL"" is an ensemble show, however, and the auxiliary cast is more than up to the task of providing even more avenues for drama and emotion.  What's so great about these roles is that, in the Pilot episode, it seems as if they are going to be little more than ""stock"" characters: the injured football star (Scott Porter), the peppy cheerleader (Minka Kelly), the ""school slut"" (Adrianne Palicki), the guy who doesn't care about anything (Taylor Kitsch), and even the over-enthusiastic Dillon booster club leader (Brad Leland).  Within just a couple of episodes, though, it becomes clear that nothing everything is as it seems, and all these unique characters have some depths to probe.On another note, the football scenes in this show (while admittedly a bit over-the-top at times) are very emotional and inspiring, adding a competitive, feisty aspect to a show that (from time to time) gets bogged down in some pretty heavy drama.  In fact, the only time this season that ""FNL"" sags even the slightest is during a midseason stretch of episodes that lacks at least some football action.Overall, the first season of ""Friday Night Lights"" is remarkable in its ability to turn stereotypes on their head and provide some real-life drama (even if sometimes the situations aren't necessarily indicative of high-schoolers).  You don't even have to be a football fan to enjoy this type of show (although it will only heighten the experience if you are!).  It simultaneously is both innocent and yet complex on differing levels, a combination that makes for high drama/emotion that will carry you through episode after episode.",5,A Show With Heart,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,3150,"['are', 'two', 'kinds', 'TV', 'dramas', 'primarily', 'make', 'think', 'primarily', 'make', 'feel', 'are', 'drawn', 'feeling', 'type', 'then', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'should', 'rocket', 'top', 'TV-watching', 'list.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'FNL', 'story', 'Dillon', 'TX', 'primarily', 'focusing', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'so', 'revered', 'community', 'When', 'new', 'coach', 'hired', 'star', 'QB', 'down', 'injury', 'team', 'tested', 'field', 'never', 'field', 'cauldron', 'other', 'issues', 'exist', 'somehow', 'tied', 'football', 'team', 'shapes', 'molds', 'citizens', 'Dillon.The', 'easy', 'criticism', 'show', 'unrealistic', 'portrayal', 'over-the-top', 'football', 'action', 'teenage', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'just', 'overall', 'level', 'drama', 'might', 'seem', 'tad', 'overblown', 'light', 'reality', 'criticisms', 'are', 'most', 'certainly', 'valid', 'FNL', 'steady', 'dose', 'one', 'X-factor', 'can', 'cure', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'ills', 'heart.The', 'showed', 'keyed', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'Coach', 'Eric', 'Taylor', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'wife', 'Tami', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'Aimee', 'Teegarden', 'new', 'starting', 'quarterback', 'Matt', 'Saracen', 'Zach', 'Gilford', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'Julie', 'boyfriend', 'four', 'characters', 'provide', 'solid', 'emotional', 'backbone', 'show', 'touching', 'issues', 'are', 'quite', 'realistic', 'emotions', 'are', 'familiar', 'viewers', 'When', 'four', 'characters', 'are', 'screen', 'combination', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'very', 'best', 'FNL', 'ensemble', 'show', 'however', 'auxiliary', 'cast', 'more', 'up', 'task', 'providing', 'even', 'more', 'avenues', 'drama', 'emotion', 'What', 'so', 'great', 'roles', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'stock', 'characters', 'injured', 'football', 'star', 'Scott', 'Porter', 'peppy', 'cheerleader', 'Minka', 'Kelly', 'school', 'slut', 'Adrianne', 'Palicki', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'anything', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'even', 'over-enthusiastic', 'Dillon', 'booster', 'club', 'leader', 'Brad', 'Leland', 'Within', 'just', 'couple', 'episodes', 'though', 'clear', 'nothing', 'everything', 'unique', 'characters', 'have', 'depths', 'probe.On', 'note', 'football', 'show', 'admittedly', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'times', 'are', 'very', 'emotional', 'inspiring', 'adding', 'competitive', 'feisty', 'aspect', 'show', 'time', 'time', 'bogged', 'down', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'drama', 'fact', 'only', 'time', 'season', 'FNL', 'sags', 'even', 'slightest', 'midseason', 'stretch', 'episodes', 'least', 'football', 'action.Overall', 'first', 'season', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'remarkable', 'ability', 'turn', 'stereotypes', 'head', 'provide', 'real-life', 'drama', 'even', 'sometimes', 'situations', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'indicative', 'high-schoolers', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'be', 'football', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'type', 'show', 'will', 'only', 'heighten', 'experience', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'innocent', 'yet', 'complex', 'differing', 'levels', 'combination', 'high', 'drama/emotion', 'will', 'carry', 'episode', 'episode']",Friday Night Lights: The First Season
