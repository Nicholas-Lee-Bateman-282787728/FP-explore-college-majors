1407162,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B004GSVX94,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[2, 2]","RIVER OF DARKNESSThe last time writer/director Bruce Koehler and Kurt Angle did a film together previous to this one it was the serial killer flick &#8220;End Game&#8221;. Now if you read my review of that one or watched it yourself then you know what to expect here. This film is a horror flick that is ghost/zombie style with Angle actually a good guy here unlike that last one. Now I honestly don&#8217;t know which of the two I like more, I will have to watch &#8220;End Game&#8221; again.Sherriff Logan [Angle] is having a bad few days in his little town as bodies are turning up with the word &#8220;Hix&#8221; on them. He has no idea what is happening but he is determined to get to the bottom of it and stop these killings. He feels like this is the work of a serial killer but the town believes otherwise. They think a family from their past is back to seek revenge on those who wronged them. Now the Sherriff may be faced with something supernatural.This is one of those movies that is bad and is funny most of the time for it. There are so many bad things about this film I don&#8217;t know where to start. Now I know this is low budget so effects and things will not be touched, in fact I kinda liked them. With that said I have to say that the script may have been the weakest thing here. The dialogue is painfully bad at times and it seems that Bruce felt that almost every scene at to have some kind of one liner before we went on to the next. That can become the drinking game of the flick, every one liner take a shot.Now I have read reviews that have said that the cinematography was bad but I disagree. In fact I actually think it was good but the editing made it seem otherwise. Like they got all kinds of coverage and the editor picked the wrong ones to go together or follow each other. An example would be the wide shot from the back of Angle pulling up on a bridge to talk to some old man who of course was standing on said bridge leaning over one side. The next shot after we see Angle walking up to him in that same shot was a shot of Angle still walking to him but from the front off to the side. This was then followed by a shot close in on them once they started talking. This was the first time in a while that I noticed the cuts in a flick in a while. It should have been the shot from the back holding all the way of Kurt walking up to him right into the tight shot of them talking. Watch it then think about it, you will see what I am saying about the editing.Now on to the acting which I am sure most people are wandering about. Now I will admit that there is some horrendous acting to be found here, in fact most of it is bad acting galore. But there are a few people here that you can tell are good actors or at least are better than what they do here. This leads me back to the script, bad dialogue is just that, on paper or said out loud. Of course the direction is to blame here as well as some people just seem off even with their reactions, one in particular is laugh out loud bad.This is the type of movie that Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have a field day with. If ever the show comes then this needs to be on there. I would have loved to have a commentary track for this from the director. Kevin Nash and Sid Vicious are the villains here and I am sure they had fun with that. Kurt Angle and &#8220;Glacier&#8221; Ray Lloyd are actually good here for the most part, like I said I blame the script. Over all this is one of those flicks that are good because of the bad. I recommend you watch it with friends and have fun with it, we did. In the end I actually liked it, it did have a cool storyline going for it.",3,"KURT ANGLE & GLACIER VS KEVIN NASH & PSYCHO SID = SO BAD IT IS GOOD, KINDA",1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,3661,"['RIVER', 'DARKNESSThe', 'last', 'time', 'writer/director', 'Bruce', 'Koehler', 'Kurt', 'Angle', 'did', 'film', 'together', 'previous', 'one', 'was', 'serial', 'killer', 'flick', '8220', 'End', 'Game', '8221', 'Now', 'read', 'review', 'one', 'watched', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'here', 'film', 'horror', 'flick', 'ghost/zombie', 'style', 'Angle', 'actually', 'good', 'guy', 'here', 'last', 'one', 'Now', 'honestly', 'don', '8217', 't', 'know', 'two', 'more', 'will', 'have', 'watch', '8220', 'End', 'Game', '8221', 'Logan', '[', 'Angle', ']', 'having', 'bad', 'few', 'days', 'little', 'town', 'bodies', 'are', 'turning', 'up', 'word', '8220', 'Hix', '8221', 'idea', 'what', 'happening', 'determined', 'get', 'bottom', 'stop', 'killings', 'work', 'serial', 'killer', 'town', 'otherwise', 'think', 'family', 'past', 'back', 'seek', 'revenge', 'who', 'wronged', 'Now', 'Sherriff', 'may', 'be', 'faced', 'something', 'supernatural.This', 'one', 'movies', 'bad', 'funny', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'things', 'film', 'don', '8217', 't', 'know', 'where', 'start', 'Now', 'know', 'low', 'budget', 'so', 'effects', 'things', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'touched', 'fact', 'kinda', 'liked', 'said', 'have', 'say', 'script', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'weakest', 'thing', 'here', 'dialogue', 'painfully', 'bad', 'times', 'Bruce', 'felt', 'almost', 'scene', 'have', 'kind', 'one', 'liner', 'went', 'next', 'can', 'become', 'drinking', 'game', 'flick', 'one', 'liner', 'take', 'shot.Now', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'have', 'said', 'cinematography', 'was', 'bad', 'disagree', 'fact', 'actually', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'editing', 'made', 'seem', 'otherwise', 'got', 'kinds', 'coverage', 'editor', 'picked', 'wrong', 'ones', 'go', 'together', 'follow', 'other', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'wide', 'shot', 'back', 'Angle', 'pulling', 'up', 'bridge', 'talk', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'course', 'was', 'standing', 'said', 'bridge', 'leaning', 'one', 'side', 'next', 'shot', 'see', 'Angle', 'walking', 'up', 'same', 'shot', 'was', 'shot', 'Angle', 'still', 'walking', 'front', 'side', 'was', 'then', 'followed', 'shot', 'close', 'once', 'started', 'talking', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'while', 'noticed', 'cuts', 'flick', 'while', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'back', 'holding', 'way', 'Kurt', 'walking', 'up', 'right', 'tight', 'shot', 'talking', 'Watch', 'then', 'think', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'am', 'saying', 'editing.Now', 'acting', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'wandering', 'Now', 'will', 'admit', 'horrendous', 'acting', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'fact', 'most', 'bad', 'acting', 'galore', 'are', 'few', 'people', 'here', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'least', 'are', 'better', 'what', 'do', 'here', 'back', 'script', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'just', 'that', 'paper', 'said', 'out', 'loud', 'course', 'direction', 'blame', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'just', 'seem', 'off', 'even', 'reactions', 'one', 'particular', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'bad.This', 'type', 'movie', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'would', 'have', 'field', 'day', 'ever', 'show', 'then', 'be', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Nash', 'Sid', 'Vicious', 'are', 'villains', 'here', 'am', 'sure', 'had', 'fun', 'Kurt', 'Angle', '8220', 'Glacier', '8221', 'Ray', 'Lloyd', 'are', 'actually', 'good', 'here', 'most', 'part', 'said', 'blame', 'script', 'one', 'flicks', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'recommend', 'watch', 'friends', 'have', 'fun', 'did', 'end', 'actually', 'liked', 'did', 'have', 'cool', 'storyline', 'going']",River of Darkness
