The last episode is such a letdown, Joey picks Pacey over Dawson, I hate that! It ruined my life for a week, seriously. Episodes leading up to the finale were pretty horrific, well at least Joey got to sleep with Dawson for the first time, but their stormy relationship was not meant to be. Dawson is rarely featured in this season, the show focuses too much on Joey and she is an annoying character with all her boy drama. The only thing I liked about this season is the strong friendship between Jen and Jack.

971045,A1UHEXKLJNRRD3,B000EAT23C,"Emily K. Stuart ""PhantomFan""","[0, 0]","Spoilers ahead: Season Six is a must have for all fans because it brings the characters full circle. Dawson gets his chance on a real movie set, and in the end, his own TV show (aptly titled, The Creek). Pacey and Joey finally get together, Jack finds true love in his partner (Doug, Pacey's brother), and Jen dies of cancer. Some of these results, I might not have chosen myself, but they are reasonable conclusions. They begin this final season in their second year of college and the finale is set 5 years into the future. Odd, perhaps, but a useful tool.The only reason I give Season 6 a rating a 4 instead of 5 is because I felt that the characters of Season 6 were just not up to snuff. I loved Audrey, but was disappointed that they threw her in a mental hospital. I really liked Audrey and felt that she really added to the ensemble. When they took her out of it, it felt flat. I was also disappointed with Eddie, Joey's final romantic interest before ultimately going back to Pacey.

971047,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B000EAT23C,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[33, 38]","All good things must come to an end. That sentence, divided in two, was the title of the two-hour series finale of Dawson's Creek, which aired at the end of the show's sixth season, ending a show that helped to bring about the rise of the WB as a television network.Season six picks up not long after where season five left off, with Joey Potter (Katie Holmes) back at Worthington, Dawson Leery (James Van der Beek) working for a director in Los Angeles, Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson) returning to the east coast after a summer on the road with his girlfriend Audrey Liddell (Busy Phillips). Jen Lindley (Michelle Williams) and Jack McPhee (Kerr Smith) return for another year at Boston Bay College, and as the season begins, they are both still living with Jen's Grams (Mary Beth Piel).Things certainly change pretty quickly for a number of the young adults who viewers watched grow up on the creek for the previous five seasons. Joey finds herself involved with a gentleman from one of her classes, who as it turns out, doesn't actually go to school at her college, but simply sits in on the classes, while working at a bar nearby. Of course, Joey ends up working at the bar/restaurant, Hell's Kitchen. Joey's new boyfriend Eddie (guest star Oliver Hudson) eventually heads to California for writer's school, but returns for a few final moments with Joey. Joey and Dawson continue to have a cold spell after their ill-fated hooking early in the season, but come to realize their friendship for each other is something that can't be denied.Dawson enjoys his experience working with movie director Todd Carr (guest star Hal Oskan) and gets an opportunity to be a director when parts of the movie need to be reshot. He also gets a chance to make his dream movie, but backs out when the people in charge want to change the entire script. He dates a Hollywood starlet (guest star Bianca Kajlich), which leads to his riff with Joey. He also entrusts all his money to Pacey in an attempt to make his movie, and when Pacey's plan backfires, his friendship with Dawson is tested.Pacey began the season dating Audrey, but her eventual slide into trouble spelled trouble for the pair. While Pacey got a job (thanks to Audrey's dad) selling stocks, Audrey fell deeper into trouble with drugs and alchohol, eventually leading to her having to head back out west to enter rehab. She also gets her first chance to sing, when a friend's band takes her on as a vocalist. Pacey finds out he is very good at his job and makes a lot of money, but when his hot stock fails, he loses everything, including his friendship with Dawson.Jen meets CJ (guest star Jensen Ackles) who she pursues until the two finally become an item midway through the season. She volunteers with him at the college help line and even gets to host a benefit session of Lovelines with Adam Carolla and Dr. Drew, where everyone's love lives are out for the world to see, including hers and CJs. She also has to join her Grams as the show's matriarchal figure battles cancer.Jack finds new love with David (guest star Greg Rikaart), a friend of CJs and they also have their problems, which like Jen's, get aired on the Lovelines benefit. Jack and Pacey end up sharing an apartment with Emma (guest star Meghan Gray), who also happens to work with Joey and Eddie at Hell's Kitchen.As the sixth season draws to a close (in the episode prior to the finale), Joey gets the gang together to help Dawson make his movie after he loses all his money. The independent film he made helped him to land the gig viewers find him in when the finale comes around.In the finale, which takes place five years in the future, Dawson is the executive producer for a WB show entitled ""The Creek"" essentially mocking the show itself. Jen is a single mother in New York, while Jack is back in Capeside teaching and dating Pacey's brother Doug (guest star Dylan Neal), who Pacey always teased about being gay, though he never was revealed that way until the finale. Joey is an editor with a publishing company in New York, while Pacey owns and operates the Icehouse Restaurant in Capeside, the place that used to be owned by Joey's family.The gang reunites in Capeside for Dawson's mom's (guest star and former series regular Mary-Margaret Humes) wedding, where the group learns some startling news about Jen, Dawson gets to rewrite history through his television show and Joey finally chooses Pacey and they settle into their lives together, watching The Creek each Wednesday at 8 p.m.It was obvious from the writing of the finale that creator Kevin Williamson returned to the show for that one episode. The finale was well done and well thought out and Williamson and producer Paul Stupin give a good commentary for the two-hour episode. The finale wrapped things up in a solid way, with everyone's loose ends seeming to be tied up, with Dawson getting his meeting with Spielberg and Joey and Pacey winding up together. The issue of whether Joey would choose Dawson or Pacey was one that divided fans of the show for six years, but I believe the choice was the correct one, though Williamson admits that he went back and forth when writing the finale.Throughout the season, former series regulars Humes and Nina Repeta (who played Joey's sister Bessie), make appearances, as well as guest stars Mika Boorem, Taylor Handley (Oliver on The O.C.), Lukas Behnken (Topher on Everwood), Mimi Rogers and Jamie Bergman.In addition to the finale commentary, the extras include a great booklet highlighting moments from the show and the characters that the actors created. This was a great addition to the set and I was happy to see it included.Also, it was nice to hear the original theme song again, though just for one episode. Up until the finale, all the episodes featured the Jann Arden tune ""Run Like Mad"" over the credits, while the finale featured Paula Cole's ""I Don't Wanna Wait."" I imagine this was possible because the finale had been previously released on DVD and I am sure the company had already paid for its use on this episode. Either way, it was nice to hear it again.This season set was a solid way to end the Dawson's Creek DVD series and the show itself provided good closure on a six-year run.",5,The Creek runs

971048,A1H8MMSBKKVK26,B000EAT23C,"KATE JONSON ""Simba Lover""","[0, 0]","I never missed an episode of DC doing S1-S4, but I stopped watching it as much after the fourth season. High School shows usually go downhill after HS and that's what happened to ""Dawson's Creek."" The gang went to college and the show lost it's appeal. Doing the original airing of S5-S6 I could not tell you what was happening because I barely watched it. I did watch the 2 hour series finale when it aired. I re watched S5 & S6 recently. Dawson is missed for a lot of S6 and that was all James' doing. When he is around, he's not hanging with the old gang. He spends a lot of his time with his director friend, Todd and his[Dawson] actress girlfriend. Since S2 I've always found a lot of the new characters they introduce for one season to be boring. C.J. is boring. Jensen 100x better on SPN. Eddie is boring. Emma is boring. I liked Audrey in S5, but in S6 she becomes very unlikable until the final episodes of the season. Dawson and Joey finally do the deed and it's unsexy and boring like the rest of their romantic relationship. They finally break up for good this season. After their one night stand, they're over once Joey finds out he had a girlfriend back in L.A. He broke up with his girlfriend over the answering machine before he slept with Joey. Dawson and Joey do not share many scenes together after the break up. Audrey and Pacey's relationship comes crashing down in S6. They were cute in S5, but I never believed they actually loved each other. It was more of a sex thing. Most of the episodes are pretty boring until Episode 14 ""Clean and Sober."" Pacey and Jack throw a house party and what a party it is! Pacey and Joey come back together in this episode. Then comes ""Castaways,"" TWT, SAV and LB. The show finally felt like DC again.  PJ break up in LB, but it's an awesome episode regardless. I will not call it a bad episode because of the ending. That's silly and so not me. LB and CA are two of the best episodes of the series. Carolla makes LL funny. C22 is good, but Pacey and Dawson have another big fall out because Pacey loses Dawson's money for his movie. Pacey comes clean in the next episode GBYBR. JPACR is a really nice episode leading us into the series finale. Joey gets everyone together to help raise money for Dawson's movie. Pacey goes out on his own and raises money for the movie. He then gives the money to Dawson. At the end Joey finally goes to freaking Paris, France! The 2 part series finale comes next and it's amazing. A beautiful way to end the show.Best S6 episodes: Merry Mayhem, Clean & Sober, Castaways, That Was Then, Sex and Violence, Love Bites, Joey Potter and Capeside Redemption, All Good Things/Must Come to an End.",3,Very weak season,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,2679,"['never', 'missed', 'episode', 'DC', 'doing', 'S1-S4', 'stopped', 'watching', 'much', 'fourth', 'season', 'High', 'School', 'shows', 'usually', 'go', 'downhill', 'HS', 'what', 'happened', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'gang', 'went', 'college', 'show', 'lost', 'appeal', 'Doing', 'original', 'airing', 'S5-S6', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'was', 'happening', 'barely', 'watched', 'did', 'watch', '2', 'hour', 'series', 'finale', 'when', 'aired', 're', 'watched', 'S5', 'S6', 'recently', 'Dawson', 'missed', 'lot', 'S6', 'was', 'James', 'doing', 'When', 'around', 'not', 'hanging', 'old', 'gang', 'lot', 'time', 'director', 'friend', 'Todd', '[', 'Dawson', ']', 'actress', 'girlfriend', 'S2', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'lot', 'new', 'characters', 'introduce', 'one', 'season', 'be', 'boring', 'C.J', 'boring', 'Jensen', '100x', 'better', 'SPN', 'Eddie', 'boring', 'Emma', 'boring', 'liked', 'Audrey', 'S5', 'S6', 'very', 'unlikable', 'final', 'episodes', 'season', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'finally', 'do', 'deed', 'unsexy', 'boring', 'rest', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'finally', 'break', 'up', 'good', 'season', 'one', 'night', 'stand', ""'re"", 'once', 'Joey', 'out', 'had', 'girlfriend', 'back', 'L.A', 'broke', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'answering', 'machine', 'slept', 'Joey', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'many', 'scenes', 'together', 'break', 'up', 'Audrey', 'Pacey', 'relationship', 'crashing', 'down', 'S6', 'were', 'cute', 'S5', 'never', 'believed', 'actually', 'loved', 'other', 'was', 'more', 'sex', 'thing', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'boring', 'Episode', '14', 'Clean', 'Sober', 'Pacey', 'Jack', 'throw', 'house', 'party', 'what', 'party', 'Pacey', 'Joey', 'come', 'back', 'together', 'episode', 'Then', 'Castaways', 'TWT', 'SAV', 'LB', 'show', 'finally', 'felt', 'DC', 'again', 'PJ', 'break', 'up', 'LB', 'awesome', 'episode', 'regardless', 'will', 'not', 'call', 'bad', 'episode', 'ending', 'silly', 'so', 'not', 'LB', 'CA', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'Carolla', 'LL', 'funny', 'C22', 'good', 'Pacey', 'Dawson', 'have', 'big', 'fall', 'Pacey', 'Dawson', 'money', 'movie', 'Pacey', 'clean', 'next', 'episode', 'GBYBR', 'JPACR', 'really', 'nice', 'episode', 'leading', 'series', 'finale', 'Joey', 'everyone', 'together', 'help', 'raise', 'money', 'Dawson', 'movie', 'Pacey', 'out', 'own', 'money', 'movie', 'then', 'money', 'Dawson', 'end', 'Joey', 'finally', 'freaking', 'Paris', 'France', '2', 'part', 'series', 'finale', 'next', 'amazing', 'beautiful', 'way', 'end', 'show.Best', 'S6', 'episodes', 'Merry', 'Mayhem', 'Clean', 'Sober', 'Castaways', 'Was', 'Then', 'Sex', 'Violence', 'Love', 'Bites', 'Joey', 'Potter', 'Capeside', 'Redemption', 'All', 'Good', 'Things/Must', 'Come', 'End']",Dawson's Creek: Season 6

971051,A1LF5XT1MOUFEZ,B000EAT23C,"Martin Miller ""marty party""","[9, 22]","Season 6 was a joke. For lack of a better way of saying it. This season Dawson's Creek lost what was important, the relationships between the four lead characters. This season features little in the way of interaction between Dawson, Jenn, Pacey, and Joey. The interaction that is missed the most is that between Dawson and Joey. The two finally sleep together in the opening episode, one of the best of the series, but it all goes down hill from there, and after about the fifth episode the two have little or no interaction.Dawson's character spends most of the season not even with the other characters. He spends it in LA working on his movie career. The other characters continue their lives in Boston. Joey has a new fling with the character of Eddie. Eddie (played by Oliver Hudson) was a excellent character, but I never felt chemistry between he and Holmes. Jack's relationship comes and goes, while Pacey and Audrey self distruct. Another major dissapointment of this season was the writers urge to make Audrey go so nuts. That said it did provide for some funny moments during the Christmas episode. It just really destoryed a character that was so great for no reason. Her and Pacey made a great couple and in my opinion should have ended the show together, but instead Mid-season the writers decided to throw us back in to the old Joey-Pacey love story. To me this made little sense at all. Their story line had been resovled quite nicely during the fifth season, and during this season with no forshadowing of any kind the writers just throw us back in to their relationship. The two spend a night in a K-mart and all their old feelings just come back. This is the set up for Joey ""shocking"" the world with her decision at the end of the series. Jenn begins a relationship with a character named C.J. (played by Jensen Ackles). By the series finale the storyline is never resloved and people are left wondering at the end of the series, ""What went wrong?""I just found this season very all over the place and not really to be much of a Dawson's Creek season. If anything this season shows us what a Joey Potter spin-off would have been like.And then there are the music changes. I don't particularly mind the music changes for this particular season. The original music selected for this particular season was pretty crappy to begin with, so any music changes will probably be welcomed.All in all, if your a fan of the show you have to watch this season. For better or worse it is the end of a legacy. It is just too bad the show didn't go out with the magic of the fourth or fifth season, instead it went out on a low note.",2,The Low Point in the Dawson's Creek history!,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,2637,"['Season', '6', 'was', 'joke', 'lack', 'better', 'way', 'saying', 'season', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'lost', 'what', 'was', 'important', 'relationships', 'four', 'lead', 'characters', 'season', 'little', 'way', 'interaction', 'Dawson', 'Jenn', 'Pacey', 'Joey', 'interaction', 'missed', 'most', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'two', 'finally', 'sleep', 'together', 'opening', 'episode', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'down', 'hill', 'there', 'fifth', 'episode', 'two', 'have', 'little', 'interaction.Dawson', 'character', 'most', 'season', 'not', 'even', 'other', 'characters', 'LA', 'working', 'movie', 'career', 'other', 'characters', 'continue', 'lives', 'Boston', 'Joey', 'new', 'fling', 'character', 'Eddie', 'Eddie', 'played', 'Oliver', 'Hudson', 'was', 'excellent', 'character', 'never', 'felt', 'chemistry', 'Holmes', 'Jack', 'relationship', 'Pacey', 'Audrey', 'distruct', 'major', 'dissapointment', 'season', 'was', 'writers', 'urge', 'make', 'Audrey', 'go', 'so', 'nuts', 'said', 'did', 'provide', 'funny', 'moments', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'just', 'really', 'destoryed', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'reason', 'Pacey', 'made', 'great', 'couple', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'show', 'together', 'instead', 'Mid-season', 'writers', 'decided', 'throw', 'back', 'old', 'Joey-Pacey', 'love', 'story', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'story', 'line', 'had', 'been', 'resovled', 'quite', 'nicely', 'fifth', 'season', 'season', 'forshadowing', 'kind', 'writers', 'just', 'throw', 'back', 'relationship', 'two', 'spend', 'night', 'K-mart', 'old', 'feelings', 'just', 'come', 'back', 'set', 'up', 'Joey', 'shocking', 'world', 'decision', 'end', 'series', 'Jenn', 'relationship', 'character', 'named', 'C.J', 'played', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'series', 'storyline', 'never', 'resloved', 'people', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'end', 'series', 'What', 'went', 'wrong', 'just', 'found', 'season', 'very', 'place', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'much', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'season', 'anything', 'season', 'what', 'Joey', 'Potter', 'spin-off', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'like.And', 'then', 'are', 'music', 'changes', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'mind', 'music', 'particular', 'season', 'original', 'music', 'selected', 'particular', 'season', 'was', 'pretty', 'crappy', 'begin', 'music', 'changes', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'welcomed.All', 'fan', 'show', 'have', 'watch', 'season', 'better', 'worse', 'end', 'legacy', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'magic', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'season', 'instead', 'went', 'out', 'low', 'note']",Dawson's Creek: Season 6

They hook up, they break up, they second guess themselves, they relight fires, they put out fires, theres Re-hab, returns, its just to all over the place and there is no real storyline/character development..  did the writers discover ""whip-it's"" durring  seasons 5-6 ?  Ok no more bashing, im going to finish this last disc and then watch the series ender.. then i will re-visit this review.  My product did arrive on time and in good condition.Update:  the last two episodes in season 6 are very good and the two hour season finale is awesome..  alot of folks say skip seasons 5&6 and just watch 1-4 and then the finale, problem is as bad as seasons 5-6 are theres alot that happens in them and you need to see them for everything to tie in together.
