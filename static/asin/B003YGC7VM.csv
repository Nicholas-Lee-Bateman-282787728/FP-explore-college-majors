1376298,AWA88F5TOX8VL,B003YGC7VM,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[6, 7]","[LENNONYC - (2010) - approx.115 min. - fullscreen presentation - written and directed by Michael Epstein] A highly interesting and reverential documentary detailing Lennon's year's in America - no Beatlemania, no Fab Four, no childhood pics, art school or 'Cavern days' rehashing, no speculation or innuendo and, no sappy emotional brouhaha elevating Lennon to Godlike status. Here we are treated to hearing about  the man who had it all but was bored, tired and weary of London, seeking the other modern-day 'Rome', New York, and feeling extremely at home there in his own words. We get to hear about some lesser-known facets of his life in NYC, from those who knew him well - long-time friend and photographer Bob Gruen, recording engineer and producer Roy Cicala, the guys in Elephant's Memory, whose band he fell into after producing their album for Apple records, a surprisingly direct and emotional Yoko, producer Jack Douglas ('Double Fantasy'), and bandmates Klaus Voorman, Andy Newmark and Jim Keltner, among others. We hear about his weaknesses as a man as well as his strengths as a composer, artist and human being.It sheds more light on this chapter in John's life than any video representation that preceded it. There's the induction and swift exit into the civil rights revolts spearheaded by Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, the 'Free John Sinclair' rally (whose audio and video have finally been remastered), the appearance with Elton at Madison Square Garden in '75, the years fighting deportation, the hatred Nixon and Hoover had for him in these deportation nightmares (and vice-versa), his 'lost weeks' in L.A. with Harry Nillson, Keith Moon, Ringo and Paul McCartney, previously unheard studio versions and rehearsals, musical cues from John, comments, banter, arguments and screaming matches with Phil Spector, self-imposed retirement and life as a father and househusband with infant Sean, and the return to the Record Plant to resume his career, criminally cut-short by his assassination in 1980 on his 40th birthday. (Thankfully, not much time is spent dwelling on this tragedy).What sets this apart from your typical documentary are the graphic visuals, photos, and dialogue spread out on the screen over the photographic images like Ralph Steadman's H.S.T. verbal artillery or 'Yellow Submarine' speech splattering, lending movement to what would otherwise be much more static and sedate. It flows along so well that it seems the ending comes too soon, and that can't be a bad thing in a documentary, now can it? No matter how many hours of video you have of Lennon and the Beatles, this dvd brings something different and welcome to the table. Commemorating the final decade in the life of one of the 20th Century's most influential and uniquely important figures, it proves that even today, Lennon remains relevant and will be forever missed, though with us always.

1376300,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B003YGC7VM,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[5, 6]","John Lennon's story has so many different facets that it's actually more effective to treat them rather seperately. His creaive awakenings during The Beatles of course is highly well documented inThe Beatles Anthologyand the events in his life that formed him in the beginning got a similar treatment inNowhere Boy. All the same much about his life with Yoko Ono after the breakup of The Beatles has been shrowded in mystery and speculative thinking on many sides. This extremely well done documentary film looks to give a well balanced and unbiased look at this era of John Lennon's life,covering the years emmediatly following the demise of The Beatles all the way up to his tragic murder one decade later. And that is the decade that defines this presentation.We begin with John and Yoko decamping to New York after over a year of complete harrassment and mistreatment by the British press about the marriage. John finds himself in love with the city upon arrival and emmediatly takes up with two ""yippie"" icons of the period,Jerry Rubin and Abbey Hoffman with whom he becomes intensely involved in terms of politics. During this time he manages to not only record a controversial and deeply political album with Yoko calledSometime In New York Citybut also manages to free the imprisoned John Sinclair and attempting to assist newly registered voters during the first election in which 18 year olds were allowed to do so. Although during the turbulant Nixon/Watergate era Lennon not only found himself on the presidents enemy list but found himself in an ongoing battle to gain his US residency and green card. These events take a toll on John's already trouble personal psyce and a public display of ludeness results in a two year seperation from Ono.While Yoko becomes highly creatively successful during this time John finds himself basically a derilict urban junkie/drunk in LA during what he called his ""lost weekend"". In a way it was a one off onstage appearance with mutual admirirer Elton John that reunited John and Yoko. Of course before you know it they are starting a family with their child Sean as well as John's success at receiving his green card. Much has been said on both sides about John's actions during the remainder of the 70's,lately much of it on the negative side. This docu clearly takes the side that John was genuinely committed to being the ""house husband"" he presented himself to be while Yoko handled all the business dealings. He became self consciously a private person,a non leader during the years after the birth of John and until his musical comeback with Yoko onDouble Fantasywhich,as this pointed out actually presented John in something of a more retro rock MOR mode and Yoko as a modern musical innovator on the cutting edge of the new wave sound.Of course we know where this ends;John's murder at the time where his life was finally starting to look up. Nor I or many people out there have much of an idea of every single aspect of his life as a family man in the Dakota during his final years. Not only does this discuss his life at the time but also covers in great detail the music he was making during all of these events and how it was always indelibly linked with his life. Over the years there have been many attempts to document the life of John Lennon in every conceivable variety of documentary and feature film and in most cases they've ended up either incomplete or highly bias. But during 2010,at which time John would've turned 70 both this and the filmNowhere Boyboth give two of the most broad and well conseived outlooks on two seperate aspects of John's life and provide excellent insight into the sources of both his musical creativity and inner sanctum.",5,An Excellent Documentary On The John & Yoko Years,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,3720,"['John', 'Lennon', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'facets', 'actually', 'more', 'effective', 'treat', 'rather', 'seperately', 'creaive', 'awakenings', 'Beatles', 'course', 'highly', 'well', 'documented', 'inThe', 'Beatles', 'Anthologyand', 'events', 'life', 'formed', 'beginning', 'got', 'similar', 'treatment', 'inNowhere', 'Boy', 'same', 'much', 'life', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'breakup', 'Beatles', 'been', 'shrowded', 'mystery', 'speculative', 'thinking', 'many', 'sides', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'film', 'give', 'well', 'balanced', 'unbiased', 'look', 'era', 'John', 'Lennon', 'life', 'covering', 'years', 'emmediatly', 'following', 'demise', 'Beatles', 'way', 'tragic', 'murder', 'one', 'decade', 'later', 'decade', 'presentation.We', 'begin', 'John', 'Yoko', 'decamping', 'New', 'York', 'year', 'complete', 'harrassment', 'mistreatment', 'British', 'press', 'marriage', 'John', 'love', 'city', 'arrival', 'emmediatly', 'up', 'two', 'yippie', 'icons', 'period', 'Jerry', 'Rubin', 'Abbey', 'Hoffman', 'whom', 'intensely', 'involved', 'terms', 'politics', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'record', 'controversial', 'deeply', 'political', 'album', 'Yoko', 'calledSometime', 'New', 'York', 'Citybut', 'also', 'free', 'imprisoned', 'John', 'Sinclair', 'attempting', 'assist', 'newly', 'registered', 'voters', 'first', 'election', '18', 'year', 'olds', 'were', 'allowed', 'do', 'so', 'turbulant', 'Nixon/Watergate', 'era', 'Lennon', 'not', 'only', 'found', 'presidents', 'enemy', 'list', 'found', 'ongoing', 'battle', 'gain', 'US', 'residency', 'green', 'card', 'events', 'take', 'toll', 'John', 'already', 'trouble', 'personal', 'psyce', 'public', 'display', 'ludeness', 'results', 'two', 'year', 'seperation', 'Ono.While', 'Yoko', 'highly', 'creatively', 'successful', 'time', 'John', 'basically', 'derilict', 'urban', 'junkie/drunk', 'LA', 'what', 'called', 'lost', 'weekend', 'way', 'was', 'one', 'off', 'onstage', 'appearance', 'mutual', 'admirirer', 'Elton', 'John', 'reunited', 'John', 'Yoko', 'course', 'know', 'are', 'starting', 'family', 'child', 'Sean', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'success', 'receiving', 'green', 'card', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'sides', 'John', 'actions', 'remainder', '70', 'lately', 'much', 'negative', 'side', 'clearly', 'side', 'John', 'was', 'genuinely', 'committed', 'being', 'house', 'husband', 'presented', 'be', 'Yoko', 'handled', 'business', 'dealings', 'became', 'consciously', 'private', 'person', 'non', 'leader', 'years', 'birth', 'John', 'musical', 'comeback', 'Yoko', 'onDouble', 'Fantasywhich', 'pointed', 'out', 'actually', 'presented', 'John', 'something', 'more', 'retro', 'rock', 'MOR', 'mode', 'Yoko', 'modern', 'musical', 'innovator', 'cutting', 'edge', 'new', 'wave', 'sound.Of', 'course', 'know', 'where', 'John', 'murder', 'time', 'where', 'life', 'was', 'finally', 'starting', 'look', 'up', 'many', 'people', 'there', 'have', 'much', 'idea', 'single', 'aspect', 'life', 'family', 'man', 'Dakota', 'final', 'years', 'Not', 'only', 'discuss', 'life', 'time', 'also', 'great', 'detail', 'music', 'was', 'making', 'events', 'how', 'was', 'always', 'indelibly', 'linked', 'life', 'years', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'attempts', 'document', 'life', 'John', 'Lennon', 'conceivable', 'variety', 'documentary', 'feature', 'film', 'most', 'cases', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'up', 'incomplete', 'highly', 'bias', '2010', 'time', 'John', 'would', ""'ve"", 'turned', '70', 'filmNowhere', 'Boyboth', 'give', 'two', 'most', 'broad', 'well', 'conseived', 'outlooks', 'two', 'seperate', 'aspects', 'John', 'life', 'provide', 'excellent', 'insight', 'sources', 'musical', 'creativity', 'inner', 'sanctum']",Lennon NYC
1376301,A1LACLRU1P4GTE,B003YGC7VM,Bill,"[1, 1]","While it goes over a lot of ground already covered in numerous other documentaries, LENNONYC has one major advantage.  It doesn't just talk about John the activist, John the iconoclast, John the reformed philanderer and John the family man, but most importantly, John the musician.  The film is at its best when focussing on that aspect on John's life.Naturally, the film has to deal with stories previously told, such as John's flirtation with the yippie movement and problems with immigration and the FBI.  Also, despite being primarily about John's love affair with New York, the film gives just as much time to the ""lost weekend"" period in Los Angeles, much of which has been gone over before.Many of the usual suspects are interviewed, including Elliot Mintz, May Pang and the ubiquitous Geraldo Rivera but things get interesting when they talk to the musicians who played with John through the 70s.  Even when it's Jim Keltner talking about John's drinking in LA, or members of Elephant's Memory talking about having their 'phones tapped too, it brings a perspective that previous films haven't shown.  Producer Jack Douglas and Yoko's recollections of what they did on the evenings following John's death is particularly moving.The film could stand to be about twenty minutes shorter but it does bring a new angle to the story of Lennon in the US, from participants who aren't usually heard.Highlight: Recollections from musicians about making the albums and studio banter.Feature: * * * *Extras: NoneAudio: Dolby 5.1, Dolby Stereo",4,Some new perspectives,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,1538,"['lot', 'ground', 'already', 'covered', 'numerous', 'other', 'documentaries', 'LENNONYC', 'one', 'major', 'advantage', ""n't"", 'just', 'talk', 'John', 'activist', 'John', 'iconoclast', 'John', 'reformed', 'philanderer', 'John', 'family', 'man', 'most', 'importantly', 'John', 'musician', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'focussing', 'aspect', 'John', 'life.Naturally', 'film', 'deal', 'stories', 'previously', 'told', 'such', 'John', 'flirtation', 'yippie', 'movement', 'problems', 'immigration', 'FBI', 'Also', 'being', 'primarily', 'John', 'love', 'affair', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'lost', 'weekend', 'period', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'much', 'been', 'gone', 'before.Many', 'usual', 'suspects', 'are', 'interviewed', 'including', 'Elliot', 'Mintz', 'May', 'Pang', 'ubiquitous', 'Geraldo', 'Rivera', 'things', 'get', 'interesting', 'when', 'talk', 'musicians', 'who', 'played', 'John', '70s', 'Even', 'when', 'Jim', 'Keltner', 'talking', 'John', 'drinking', 'LA', 'members', 'Elephant', 'Memory', 'talking', 'having', ""'phones"", 'tapped', 'too', 'perspective', 'previous', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'shown', 'Producer', 'Jack', 'Douglas', 'Yoko', 'recollections', 'what', 'did', 'evenings', 'following', 'John', 'death', 'particularly', 'moving.The', 'film', 'could', 'stand', 'be', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'bring', 'new', 'angle', 'story', 'Lennon', 'US', 'participants', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'usually', 'heard.Highlight', 'Recollections', 'musicians', 'making', 'albums', 'studio', 'banter.Feature', '*', '*', '*', '*Extras', 'NoneAudio', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Stereo']",Lennon NYC

I just don't think it's terrific in alternation with John's stuff. I find that John's stuff sounds much better when alternated with the other solo Beatles. MUCH BETTER.And I believe that a John film-bio doesn't have to be so Yoko-centric. Even Elton John gets roped into declaring that Lennon's Madison Square Garden appearance on Thankgiving Day 1974 marked the end of John's May Pang affair and the renewal of John and Yoko's marriage. It did no such thing. For two additional months John and May's torrid affair continned apace. Many memorably torrid love affairs are shorter-lived start-to-finish than that. Yoko had such a firm hold on John by early February 1975 that John and May came within a whisker of buying a house together. They would have, but Yoko finally panicked and reeled John back in to the Dakota before John and May could scoot off to New Orleans to join Paul McCartney for a Wings recording session.Back to Mother. For a bizarre quit-smoking treatment, one that all but zombified him. In fact, the overwhelming reason why his return to Yoko would be lasting was that she got pregnant. Just as John and Cynthia's relationship was prolonged by Cyn's becoming pregnant with Julian. Absent the over-40 Yoko's desperate last-ditch attempt to conceive, John might very well have divorced her within a few years.And yet we see film after film, including this one, that give every appearance of Yoko having been granted final cut in return for access to the Lennon archives in her possession. John in fact had a VERY productive 14 months or so with May Pang. Sure, it started off rough with John's Spector sessions in L.A. disintegrating, but some of that work would be salvaged and the planned oldies album WOULD be completed. So would `Walls & Bridges', which spawned a number one song, a top-ten song and an electrifying `live' guest appearance with Elton John.So Lennon's L.A. sojourn saw alot of drinking and drugging, and being tossed from a few clubs. Sounds like a lite version of Hamburg--a much celebrated Beatles phase. But seen from Yoko's quasi-Stalinist perspective, everything bad about that stretch was caused by his being apart from her and everything good about it derived from his ties to her. May Pang gets only some token commentary in the film; no, she was obviously just a distraction from the John/Yoko romance. I suppose, too, that no one wants to hurt Sean's feelings by dwelling on what a dubious relationship his parents had. And I suppose that since May Pang moved on to marriage and kids, there is only so much she feels comfortable in saying about her `loving John' phase. But come on, enough of this John and Yoko fairytale nonsense. We'd be sick of hearing about it even if it were true. The fact that John and Yoko did return to being some semblance of a couple during their work on and promotion of `Double Fantasy' is by no means the only indicator of whether their relationship would have outlasted their 1980-(1981) co-recording blitz. Other indicators sugges not.The film is  for the most part a wonderful tribute to John, and I much appreciate what's in it. What I don't appreciate is what's NOT in it because of Yoko's iron-fisted grip on the Lennon legacy. Skewing. Omitting. De-emphasizing. Spinning. Selective interviewing. Selective editing...all in the name of myth-making. It makes you want to see a Yoko-absent film bio of John. Yoko, we're tited of the propaganda. Give us some truth. If you really want your take on John to prevail, start by writing a memoir of John from your unique viewpoint. How is it that so many who knew John less well can do that but you can't? Instead of speaking up yourself, you silence dissenters. Is that a worthy legacy of the 1960s?

1376309,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003YGC7VM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[29, 33]","As we approach the thirtieth anniversary of John Lennon's death, there is quite a bit of new material being produced.  As the BBC has just released ""Lennon Naked,"" a fictionalized bio-pic of John's tumultuous last years in England--this accomplished documentary by Michael Epstein takes up right where that piece left off.  (I mention this only because I happened to watch them in conjunction, not that it has any relevance to this particular item). Initially, ""LennoNYC"" starts out as a real love letter to New York City--and I thought that this might be an intriguing and different approach.  Within a couple of minutes, though, this documentary settles into a familiar chronological framework and begins to recount the last decade of Lennon's life.  Lennon, being a public personality, obviously has tons of archival footage to utilize.  Epstein has done a nice job integrating actual press footage, home movies, and modern day interviews to flesh out a complicated artist on a journey to contentment.""LennoNYC"" can essentially be broken into four segments, but of course there is some overlap:1)  Activism:  The sequence of Lennon's arrival and first years in NYC is populated with much political and social activity.  From the awareness rallies to the immigration department's effort to deport Lennon and Ono--there is a idealism at work to change the system.  When Nixon gets reelected, Lennon's despondency leads to the next phase represented in the documentary.2)  Artistry:  Lennon separates from Yoko Ono after a very public infidelity and heads to drunken debauchery as a recording artist in Los Angeles.  He won't return to New York again until he is sober and ready move on to more serious matters.3)  Domesticity:  Reunited with Ono and happy at home with his new son Sean, Lennon withdraws from the music scene.  His obvious joy with Sean is touching (poor Julian rates a 30 second mention).4)  Contentment:  Lennon is putting it all together--awareness, music, and family life for once seem to balance and everything seems on tract.  There is obviously a bittersweet quality to this last segment as we know what is to come.""LennoNYC"" doesn't break any new ground as a film and, in truth, doesn't offer too much in new material.  Of course, Lennon is one of the most documented figures of the last 50 years--so it's no surprise!  But Epstein's documentary is an effective and affecting portrait of Lennon's last years.  It doesn't shy away from some of Lennon's more unpleasant moments, but I think it was both hopeful and uplifting.  A fitting tribute to an artist, who while not always likable, came to a place of serenity.  Lennon's legacy and legend remain a unique and poignant part of history.

1376312,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B003YGC7VM,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[8, 11]","Lennon NYC is an hour and fifty-one minute documentary that quickly covers Lennon's time in New York from his arrival in 1971 until his murder in 1980.  It begins with clips from the Double Fantasy sessions (his final album) and interviews with the musicians who worked with him on that album.  Clips from the poorly received Some Time In New York City as well as Mind Games and Walls and Bridges are also included in the film.Lennon and Yoko Ono came to New York City to escape England where they, Ono in particular, were treated badly by the English press.  New York offered them a sense of freedom and the opportunity to reinvent themselves.  As is noted in this documentary, Lennon was happy to be able to find a jacket at a trendy clothing store in New York, pay for it, and leave without any hassle.  But they also arrived during a time of activism and war resistance.  This documentary describes Lennon's connection with activists Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, and Rennie Davis which lead to years of deportation threats, phone tapping, and shadowing by the federal government.  Lennon did have supporters in government, though, including a congressmen who wrote a letter read by Lennon on the Dick Cavett Show supporting his use of the N-word in the song ""Woman is the N----- of the World.""This reviewer gained a greater respect for Yoko Ono who has many interview clips in this documentary.  When John cheated on her, she showed that she could move on with herself and her career without him.  She also would not allow John--who fell into drink--to return to her until he was ready.  The nicest parts of the documentary for this reviewer are when John and Yoko got back together following Lennon's concert with Elton John in New York (Elton John also appears in interview clips in this documentary).  Lennon won his deportation case, celebrated his 35th birthday and the birth of his son Sean on the same day.  After that, he took a hiatus from the music business to became a house husband for a few years and this film offers home movies and audio clips of John with his little boy.More clips from the Double Fantasy sessions are presented.  Lennon went back to his early rock 'n roll roots and was writing songs for his generation.  Yoko Ono finally received good reviews for her songs on the album.  Then, of course, December 8, 1980 happened.  The documentary does not dwell on his death.  Yoko Ono and others give their reactions that day but then it shifts to a reflection on his work.  Although the film is almost two hours, it moves very quickly.

Freeman ""Zach""","[84, 88]","Of all the important musicians in the last century, it's pretty easy to see that John Lennon stands out for his influence on music, pop culture, and society in general. Lennon himself - his music and activism - along with their effects on the world, have been well documented in countless short and feature-length documentaries. Now American Masters - ""an ongoing series of award-winning primetime specials examining the lives, works, and creative processes of our most outstanding cultural artists"" - takes on the subject of John Lennon and his time in New York City. The series has featured Andy Warhol, Charlie Chaplin, and Paul Simon, among others.This Lennon profile is special in that it's not a documentary about his entire life, but as the title suggests, focuses on his time in New York City with Yoko Ono, using numerous interviews with friends and bandmates along with never before-released in-studio recordings of Lennon. This is a documentary that assumes you already know quite a bit about Lennon and know why his time in New York is important and then goes on to both explain why this is true and give you a behind the scenes look at his life at this time. Without glossing over any of the rough patches (including the hiatus John and Yoko took and his subsequent time in Los Angeles), writer and director Michael Epstein gives audiences a true portrait of the legendary musician and activist as seen through the eyes of those around him (including Yoko Ono) and captured in in-studio recording sessions.The film is thoroughly engaging, though not always structurally clear. Epstein begins with the story of Lennon as an immigrant, looking to make New York City his home though the United States government (the Nixon administration to be more specific) is seeking to get him deported for his various activist causes. This is an intriguing theme, and we're privy to many of those around him discussing being followed and the FBI keeping records on them, but this storyline builds quickly and then goes on the backburner for over an hour before reappearing briefly at the very end. It's an incredible part of Lennon's story and well presented, but Epstein plays up Lennon's immigration status so much in the opening that I always felt like I was waiting for that piece of the story to come back into play. The best parts of the film are the clips of Lennon in the studio and those around him discussing his studio style. Listening to Lennon in the studio is even more fascinating than you might suspect.The portion of the film (near the end) that deals with John's time after mending ties with Yoko, the birth of his son Sean, and the work on his last album is especially touching. As with any Lennon documentary, the ending left me wishing that there was a documentary about some alternate universe where Lennon was still alive so that the ending didn't have to be so sad.",4,Great documentary about a specific timeframe in Lennon's life,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,2887,"['important', 'musicians', 'last', 'century', 'pretty', 'easy', 'see', 'John', 'Lennon', 'out', 'influence', 'music', 'pop', 'culture', 'society', 'general', 'Lennon', 'music', 'activism', 'effects', 'world', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'documented', 'countless', 'short', 'feature-length', 'documentaries', 'Now', 'American', 'Masters', 'ongoing', 'series', 'award-winning', 'primetime', 'specials', 'examining', 'lives', 'works', 'creative', 'processes', 'most', 'outstanding', 'cultural', 'artists', 'subject', 'John', 'Lennon', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'series', 'featured', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'others.This', 'Lennon', 'profile', 'special', 'not', 'documentary', 'entire', 'life', 'title', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'using', 'numerous', 'interviews', 'friends', 'bandmates', 'never', 'before-released', 'in-studio', 'recordings', 'Lennon', 'documentary', 'already', 'know', 'quite', 'bit', 'Lennon', 'know', 'why', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'important', 'then', 'explain', 'why', 'true', 'give', 'scenes', 'look', 'life', 'time', 'glossing', 'rough', 'patches', 'including', 'hiatus', 'John', 'Yoko', 'took', 'subsequent', 'time', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'writer', 'director', 'Michael', 'Epstein', 'audiences', 'true', 'portrait', 'legendary', 'musician', 'activist', 'seen', 'eyes', 'including', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'captured', 'in-studio', 'recording', 'sessions.The', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'not', 'always', 'structurally', 'clear', 'Epstein', 'story', 'Lennon', 'immigrant', 'looking', 'make', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'home', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'Nixon', 'administration', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'seeking', 'get', 'deported', 'various', 'activist', 'causes', 'intriguing', 'theme', ""'re"", 'privy', 'many', 'discussing', 'being', 'followed', 'FBI', 'keeping', 'records', 'storyline', 'builds', 'quickly', 'then', 'backburner', 'hour', 'reappearing', 'briefly', 'very', 'end', 'incredible', 'part', 'Lennon', 'story', 'well', 'presented', 'Epstein', 'up', 'Lennon', 'immigration', 'status', 'so', 'much', 'opening', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'waiting', 'piece', 'story', 'come', 'back', 'play', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'clips', 'Lennon', 'studio', 'discussing', 'studio', 'style', 'Listening', 'Lennon', 'studio', 'even', 'more', 'fascinating', 'might', 'suspect.The', 'portion', 'film', 'end', 'John', 'time', 'mending', 'ties', 'Yoko', 'birth', 'son', 'Sean', 'work', 'last', 'album', 'especially', 'touching', 'Lennon', 'documentary', 'ending', 'left', 'wishing', 'was', 'documentary', 'alternate', 'universe', 'where', 'Lennon', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'so', 'sad']",Lennon NYC
