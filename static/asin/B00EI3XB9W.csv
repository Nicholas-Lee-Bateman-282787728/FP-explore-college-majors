This show is holsom and no objectionable terms used. The story lines are interesting and the acting is very good. We need more shows like this, but I doubt those days will ever return. Tv now is just swearing, sex and no story line. I don't watch it at all anymore. The Diagnosis Murder dvds are crisp, good color, good sound and easy to navigate. I don't watch the credits usually. Hope we are regaled with the rest of the series.",5,Yes,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,569,"['am', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'more', 'wonderful', 'series', 'like', 'old', 'shows', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'swearing', 'taking', 'Lords', 'name', 'vain', 'show', 'holsom', 'objectionable', 'terms', 'used', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'interesting', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'need', 'more', 'shows', 'doubt', 'days', 'will', 'ever', 'return', 'Tv', 'now', 'just', 'swearing', 'sex', 'story', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'anymore', 'Diagnosis', 'Murder', 'dvds', 'are', 'crisp', 'good', 'color', 'good', 'sound', 'easy', 'navigate', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'credits', 'usually', 'Hope', 'are', 'regaled', 'rest', 'series']",Diagnosis Murder: Season 5 Part One
