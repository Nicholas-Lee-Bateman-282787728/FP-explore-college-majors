969054,A35U2FY3ZWLGDH,B000E5OAB6,"Jerrod Maruyama ""mediaboy""","[16, 16]","If you were at all affected by the Walt Disney companys decision to close down its 2D feature animation department, then Dream On Silly Dreamer is the film for you.  If you could care less about 2D animation, the history of Disney animation or studio politics, then this is NOT the film for you.This very short documentary (the film itself sans bonus features runs just under 40 mins) attempts to capture the feelings and emotions of Disney's odd move to close down it's 2D feature animation unit, thus ending a historic part of the studio.  Let's face it, it IS the studio.  The entire empire that Disney has become was because of 2D animation.  It all started with the historic release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, a daring and bold ARTISTIC endeavor that made Walt Disney a global phenomenon.  It ends with failed BUSINESS endeavors, an uneven mix of art and commerce that resulted in Atlantis, Treasure Planet and Home On The Range - utterly forgettable films from a company that we expect more from.  But blaming the medium seems a funny scapegoat.  'Dream On...' the documentary, in it own rambling way, passionately attempts to explain just what happend on the way to the end.  Utilizing extensive interviews with Disney artists, both past and present (most notably Andreas Deja), the film talks about the final days leading up to the layoffs of thousands of artists.  While the interviews are extremely personal and emotional they seem to only scratch the surface.  There is still anger and resentment, as would be expected.  It seems the artists are too close to the situation, the wounds still too fresh, to put a more philosophical spin on what happened and how they reacted.  That is both a strength and a weakness of the film.  While the emotion feels fresh and raw, some of the more juicy details are left out.  In its immediacy, we lose some of the perspective.  The film forgets that, most of us at leat, were not there to watch this unfold.  For employees of Disney affected by these events I am sure it means so much more.  But for a general audince it can be, at times, like looking thourgh photos of people we don't know, parties we weren't invited to.  With the exception of Deja and a few oldtimers from the days of Walt, eloquence is not the strong point of the interviews.  Watch the Super Sized bonus features for more in depth talk about the process and what went wrong.  There are some interesting descriptions of story meetings that seem to verify what Disney fans have always suspected was the moutning problems of the Disney features.  While I wish there was more - more details about what went wrong on specific pictures, who was to blame for what details, etc - it is a captivating slice of the reality of Disney animation nonetheless.  Seeing these artists speaking so genuinely about the company is extremely interesting.  The fact that this film exists, that Disney let it be is in intself a miracle.  The execs, in general, don't come off all that well.  But name calling and finger pointing are kept to a surprising minimum.  Katzenberg even comes off rather well.In the end, this film is about innocence lost.  These kinds of things happen at companies everyday around the world.  But because it is Disney, because so many of us have bought into the pixie dust and magic, including these artists, the decision, the failure, the closure seem that much more tragic and personal.  Witnessing that in this DVD makes up for its sloppiness.  While I think there was a potential to make this an even more amazing and important film as well as a historical document, it is worth viewing all the same.  With a little more focus and direction this could have been an incredible time capsule of a very specific, very dark time in Disney's history.  As it stands, it's genuine and heartfelt but under polished.  Still, as avid fans of Disney animation know, we will always take what we can get.As a side note - Very little of Pixar is mentioned.  The pending merger is not even addressed at all.  While it remains to be seen what Lassetter and Co. will do with Disney animation, the future as of this filming was not optimistic.  Only time will tell.  Perhaps Pixar will re-open 2D animation at Disney and bring back some of these great talents.  Wouldn't a happy sequel to this film be just as amazing?",4,Once Upon A Dream...,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,4336,"['were', 'affected', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'companys', 'decision', 'close', 'down', '2D', 'feature', 'animation', 'department', 'then', 'Dream', 'Silly', 'Dreamer', 'film', 'could', 'care', 'less', '2D', 'animation', 'history', 'Disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'politics', 'then', 'NOT', 'film', 'you.This', 'very', 'short', 'documentary', 'film', 'bonus', 'features', 'just', '40', 'mins', 'attempts', 'capture', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'Disney', 'odd', 'move', 'close', 'down', '2D', 'feature', 'animation', 'unit', 'thus', 'ending', 'historic', 'part', 'studio', 'Let', 'face', 'studio', 'entire', 'empire', 'Disney', 'become', 'was', '2D', 'animation', 'started', 'historic', 'release', 'Snow', 'White', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'daring', 'bold', 'ARTISTIC', 'endeavor', 'made', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'global', 'phenomenon', 'failed', 'BUSINESS', 'endeavors', 'uneven', 'mix', 'art', 'commerce', 'resulted', 'Atlantis', 'Treasure', 'Planet', 'Home', 'Range', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'films', 'company', 'expect', 'more', 'blaming', 'medium', 'funny', 'scapegoat', ""'Dream"", 'documentary', 'own', 'rambling', 'way', 'passionately', 'explain', 'just', 'what', 'happend', 'way', 'end', 'Utilizing', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'Disney', 'artists', 'past', 'present', 'most', 'notably', 'Andreas', 'Deja', 'film', 'talks', 'final', 'days', 'leading', 'up', 'layoffs', 'thousands', 'artists', 'interviews', 'are', 'extremely', 'personal', 'emotional', 'seem', 'only', 'scratch', 'surface', 'still', 'anger', 'resentment', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'artists', 'are', 'too', 'close', 'situation', 'wounds', 'still', 'too', 'fresh', 'put', 'more', 'philosophical', 'spin', 'what', 'happened', 'how', 'reacted', 'strength', 'weakness', 'film', 'emotion', 'feels', 'fresh', 'raw', 'more', 'juicy', 'details', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'immediacy', 'lose', 'perspective', 'film', 'most', 'leat', 'were', 'not', 'there', 'watch', 'unfold', 'employees', 'Disney', 'affected', 'events', 'am', 'sure', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'general', 'audince', 'can', 'be', 'times', 'looking', 'thourgh', 'photos', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'parties', 'were', ""n't"", 'invited', 'exception', 'Deja', 'few', 'oldtimers', 'days', 'Walt', 'eloquence', 'not', 'strong', 'point', 'interviews', 'Watch', 'Super', 'Sized', 'bonus', 'features', 'more', 'depth', 'talk', 'process', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'are', 'interesting', 'descriptions', 'story', 'meetings', 'seem', 'verify', 'what', 'Disney', 'fans', 'have', 'always', 'suspected', 'was', 'moutning', 'problems', 'Disney', 'features', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'more', 'details', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'specific', 'pictures', 'who', 'was', 'blame', 'what', 'details', 'etc', 'captivating', 'slice', 'reality', 'Disney', 'animation', 'nonetheless', 'Seeing', 'artists', 'speaking', 'so', 'genuinely', 'company', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'fact', 'film', 'Disney', 'let', 'be', 'miracle', 'execs', 'general', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'well', 'name', 'calling', 'finger', 'pointing', 'are', 'kept', 'surprising', 'minimum', 'Katzenberg', 'even', 'off', 'rather', 'end', 'film', 'innocence', 'lost', 'kinds', 'things', 'happen', 'companies', 'everyday', 'world', 'Disney', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'bought', 'pixie', 'dust', 'magic', 'including', 'artists', 'decision', 'failure', 'closure', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'tragic', 'personal', 'Witnessing', 'DVD', 'up', 'sloppiness', 'think', 'was', 'potential', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'important', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'historical', 'document', 'worth', 'viewing', 'same', 'little', 'more', 'focus', 'direction', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'incredible', 'time', 'capsule', 'very', 'specific', 'very', 'dark', 'time', 'Disney', 'history', 'genuine', 'heartfelt', 'polished', 'Still', 'avid', 'fans', 'Disney', 'animation', 'know', 'will', 'always', 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get.As', 'side', 'note', 'Very', 'little', 'Pixar', 'mentioned', 'pending', 'merger', 'not', 'even', 'addressed', 'be', 'seen', 'what', 'Lassetter', 'Co.', 'will', 'do', 'Disney', 'animation', 'future', 'filming', 'was', 'not', 'optimistic', 'Only', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'Perhaps', 'Pixar', 'will', 're-open', '2D', 'animation', 'Disney', 'bring', 'back', 'great', 'talents', 'Would', ""n't"", 'happy', 'sequel', 'film', 'be', 'just', 'amazing']",Dream On Silly Dreamer

I expected a documentary about animation, something about the end of traditional animation from the world's single largest producer of animation.I was very disappointed. It's 40 minutes of whining about being laid off. ""Disney wouldn't give me my desk; I had to buy it from them."" I'm sorry; I probably would have made a similar film myself almost 20 years ago when I was first laid off from a job I loved, but several downsizings later it's been beat into me that if you don't own the company you're just a number on a spreadsheet, no matter how much you like the job or how much you might bring to it. Watching other people learn that lesson just isn't compelling viewing for me.So, I wanted a film about the end of traditional animation. I got a film about people saying goodbye to their co-workers. Been there, done that, that's life.

969057,AZW2868HYUPZO,B000E5OAB6,"Leon Alvarado ""movie connoisseur""","[2, 3]","This is an interesting look at the events that transpired within the animation department over at the Disney studios. It is a sad reminder that most of conventional animation is on its way out (at least in the mainstream of movie theaters). The idea behind the documentary is compelling although it is told and pieced together in a somewhat amateurish way. To drive their point the producers should have mentioned the cultish animation movie ""The Thief and the Cobbler"" aka ""Arabian Night"" which was truly a labor of love for animators and which took over two decades to get it completed and release (albeit not without its own problems). I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that I agree with the documentary's take  in the sense that conventional (not CG) animation is still a valid medium.  A medium that should not be pushed away for the sake of cheaper means in order to fatten a corporation's bottom line. Afterall, Disney is what it is today because of animation, no one can argue with that. Regarding the production values of the film, it is shot and edited in a way reminiscent of a school film. It contains interesting information but lacks some ""polish"" in its delivery. The animated segments are ""cute"" and somewhat nostalgic to those seen in the early sixties but are not necessarily well animated by themselves. In the producers' defense, the film was put together as a response to the events that changed their lives and not necessarily as a documentary for commercial purposes. It is merely a vehicle for them to share their story with us and, in all respects, it does that. If you are interested in animation or animation history, this film will be useful to you. Otherwise, it may not be your cup of tea.",3,Dreaming on.,1169510400,"01 23, 2007",2007,1730,"['interesting', 'look', 'events', 'transpired', 'animation', 'department', 'Disney', 'studios', 'sad', 'reminder', 'most', 'conventional', 'animation', 'way', 'least', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'theaters', 'idea', 'documentary', 'compelling', 'told', 'pieced', 'together', 'somewhat', 'amateurish', 'way', 'drive', 'point', 'producers', 'should', 'have', 'mentioned', 'cultish', 'animation', 'movie', 'Thief', 'Cobbler', 'aka', 'Arabian', 'Night', 'was', 'truly', 'labor', 'love', 'animators', 'took', 'over', 'two', 'decades', 'get', 'completed', 'release', 'not', 'own', 'problems', 'guess', 'point', ""'m"", 'trying', 'make', 'here', 'agree', 'documentary', 'take', 'sense', 'conventional', 'not', 'CG', 'animation', 'still', 'valid', 'medium', 'medium', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'pushed', 'away', 'sake', 'cheaper', 'means', 'order', 'fatten', 'corporation', 'bottom', 'line', 'Afterall', 'Disney', 'what', 'today', 'animation', 'one', 'can', 'argue', 'Regarding', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'shot', 'edited', 'way', 'reminiscent', 'school', 'film', 'interesting', 'information', 'polish', 'delivery', 'animated', 'segments', 'are', 'cute', 'somewhat', 'nostalgic', 'seen', 'early', 'sixties', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'well', 'animated', 'producers', 'defense', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'response', 'events', 'changed', 'lives', 'not', 'necessarily', 'documentary', 'commercial', 'purposes', 'merely', 'vehicle', 'share', 'story', 'respects', 'are', 'interested', 'animation', 'animation', 'history', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'useful', 'Otherwise', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'tea']",Dream On Silly Dreamer

On the one hand, these newly-unemployed artists speak from their experience, discussing the pain of being unceremoniously dismissed from a studio that was their home, and that's sad. But though the ""death of 2-D animation"" debate will undoubtedly strike a chord in many viewers, I found the film might have played better had it been more objective. Anyone who's lost a job they needed badly might have a hard time identifying with the underlying sense of entitlement that occasionally pops up. The emotion and the heartbreak are real, but one gets the sense that the Disney employees were insulated in sometimes harmful ways from the realities of the industry, the truth about the corporate mentality, and the significance of their own careers. I'd think this would best be seen as a cautionary tale for anyone who believes their job is guaranteed secure until retirement.
