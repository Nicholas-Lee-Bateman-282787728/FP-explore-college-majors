John Houseman reprises his role as Law Professor Charles Kingsfield and does a terrific job. The other actors are all very good too in their roles as first year law students. Individually, each character is well developed and not necessarily a foil to the lead, James Stephens. Although the writing does become a little predictable towards the end of the season the first few episodes are riveting. It was a treat to watch a show that is as intelligently written and enacted as this one.

1222047,A39VR7BZ8RN21J,B001O4KBMI,Arthur C. Adams,"[4, 4]","The Paper Chase ran for 3.5 seasons, one on CBS, and 2.5 (the final season being a short one) on the then-young cable network Showtime. This is the inaugural season from CBS. When Showtime picked it up, they advertised it as the show that was ""too good for commercial television"", and they were right.This was the era when cheesy sitcoms dominated the airwaves. Dramas were cop shows like Starsky and Hutch and Columbo, ""detective"" series Charlie's Angels, schmaltzy family series like The Waltons, general idiocy like The Love Boat, and the beginning of the prime-time soap era with Dallas. Some of those had their merits, but the Paper Chase was an oasis in television's ""vast wasteland"".The first season is the story of five first year law students at an unnamed law school that was pretty clearly supposed to be Hah-vahd... errrr.... Harvard Law, focusing on the idealistic James Hart, played by James Stephens.The real star of the show, though, was John Houseman, absolutely brilliant as the intimidating contracts professor, and general deity of The Law (capitalization intentional -- I am certain you can hear the capitals when he says it) Charles W. Kingsfield.The stories are all compelling, the characters well-written and likable. Even Kingsfield is given a human side, albeit one he rarely if ever displays to his students.Now, there is a very definite ""seventies"" feel to the whole thing. The clothing and hairstyles obviously are from that era. A number of the episodes have ""very special episode"" written all over them, but even then, they're well done.Since this was from the era when the idea of storylines spanning multiple episodes was pretty much unknown, there's a lack of continuity that will seem a little odd to fans of modern television. For instance, one character develops a gambling problem in one episode. Forty five or so minutes later, its resolved. It gets brief mentions in one or two later episodes, but isn't addressed further. A modern series would probably take several episodes to cover that -- he'd take up playing poker in one episode, wind a few hands in another, start losing later, get into debt even later, etc.While Shout Factory deserves enormous kudos for releasing such a fine series on DVD, the reproduction of it is weak. They certainly don't have the sharpness expected from a DVD (especially not if you've been spoiled by Blu-Ray). I realize that the masters may not have been in the best of shape, but don't expect this to look as stunning as your Blu-Ray copies of Lost, for instance.And then there's the ungodly painful Seals and Croft theme song that gives Seventies light rock a (very very) bad name, but that's what fast forward buttons were invented for. (Thankfully, Showtime ditched that for their episodes, replacing with a classical piece -- Bach, I think.)",5,"It really was ""too good for commercial television""",1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,2820,"['Paper', 'Chase', 'ran', '3.5', 'seasons', 'one', 'CBS', '2.5', 'final', 'season', 'being', 'short', 'one', 'then-young', 'cable', 'network', 'Showtime', 'inaugural', 'season', 'CBS', 'When', 'Showtime', 'picked', 'up', 'advertised', 'show', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'commercial', 'television', 'were', 'right.This', 'was', 'era', 'when', 'cheesy', 'sitcoms', 'dominated', 'airwaves', 'Dramas', 'were', 'cop', 'shows', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'Columbo', 'detective', 'series', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'schmaltzy', 'family', 'series', 'Waltons', 'general', 'idiocy', 'Love', 'Boat', 'beginning', 'prime-time', 'soap', 'era', 'Dallas', 'had', 'merits', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'was', 'oasis', 'television', 'vast', 'wasteland', '.The', 'first', 'season', 'story', 'five', 'first', 'year', 'law', 'students', 'unnamed', 'law', 'school', 'was', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'supposed', 'be', 'Hah-vahd', 'errrr', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'focusing', 'idealistic', 'James', 'Hart', 'played', 'James', 'Stephens.The', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'was', 'John', 'Houseman', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'intimidating', 'contracts', 'professor', 'general', 'deity', 'Law', 'capitalization', 'intentional', 'am', 'certain', 'can', 'hear', 'capitals', 'when', 'Charles', 'W.', 'Kingsfield.The', 'stories', 'are', 'compelling', 'characters', 'well-written', 'likable', 'Even', 'Kingsfield', 'given', 'human', 'side', 'one', 'rarely', 'ever', 'students.Now', 'very', 'definite', 'seventies', 'feel', 'whole', 'thing', 'clothing', 'hairstyles', 'obviously', 'are', 'era', 'number', 'episodes', 'have', 'very', 'special', 'episode', 'written', 'even', 'then', ""'re"", 'well', 'done.Since', 'was', 'era', 'when', 'idea', 'storylines', 'spanning', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'unknown', 'lack', 'continuity', 'will', 'seem', 'little', 'odd', 'fans', 'modern', 'television', 'instance', 'one', 'character', 'gambling', 'problem', 'one', 'episode', 'Forty', 'five', 'so', 'minutes', 'later', 'resolved', 'brief', 'mentions', 'one', 'two', 'later', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'addressed', 'further', 'modern', 'series', 'would', 'probably', 'take', 'several', 'episodes', 'cover', ""'d"", 'take', 'up', 'playing', 'poker', 'one', 'episode', 'wind', 'few', 'hands', 'start', 'losing', 'later', 'get', 'debt', 'even', 'later', 'etc.While', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'enormous', 'kudos', 'releasing', 'fine', 'series', 'DVD', 'reproduction', 'weak', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sharpness', 'expected', 'DVD', 'especially', 'not', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spoiled', 'Blu-Ray', 'realize', 'masters', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'shape', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'look', 'as', 'stunning', 'Blu-Ray', 'copies', 'Lost', 'instance.And', 'then', 'ungodly', 'painful', 'Seals', 'Croft', 'theme', 'song', 'Seventies', 'light', 'rock', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'name', 'what', 'fast', 'forward', 'buttons', 'were', 'invented', 'Thankfully', 'Showtime', 'ditched', 'episodes', 'replacing', 'classical', 'piece', 'Bach', 'think']",The Paper Chase: Season 1
1222048,A68DAVL2772KF,B001O4KBMI,Arthur Leonard,"[6, 6]","I've long been a big fan of the Paper Chase movie, which I saw shortly after receiving my own law school acceptance letter during my senior year of college.  Attending Harvard Law after seeing that movie was a ""real trip.""  But when I moved to NYC after law school and began working, I didn't really have time to watch network TV series, so I didn't see the TV follow-up.  Now I'm having a grand time watching the first season of The Paper Chase, from the late 1970s.  John Jay Osborne, the author of the novel on which the movie was based, wrote some of the TV scripts and was technical consultant for the series, so the classroom scenes present a reasonably accurate picture of contract law (a subject I've been teaching as a law professor for the past twenty years).  Some of the plots are silly, of course, and some of the events would not happen during the first year of law school.  The production is done more cheaply than the movie, so the class and classroom is smaller - but having an entire season to flesh out the character gives John Houseman much more to play with as Professor Kingsfield, and James Stephens makes an acceptable leading man as ""Hart.""  The supporting players are fine as well, although it does seem strange that new students are constantly popping up in this class as the guest-star of the week.  One puts reality aside a bit for a network TV series.  But there are some really good insights into the law student experience, and I've found myself thinking that some of my own 1L's could profit by watching certain episodes.

1222052,A3TVK4EYNM02XW,B001O4KBMI,Ed Howell,"[2, 3]","I must have been one of three people who watched the original run on CBS in the late 70s. John Houseman later wrote, correctly, that it was well reviewed and was like by CBS head Bill Paley, but it was up against powerhouse ABC shows ""Happy Days"" and ""Laverne and Shirley."" CBS later moved it to the weekend where it began to pick up a little steam, but then dumped it back to the graveyard against ""Happy Days,"" insuring its death. The show was so loved it lived a life in reruns on PBS and elsewhere until Showtime finally picked it up for a few more seasons of new episodes. That series dropped and added a few characters, changed the theme and advanced the plot to cover Hart's remaining years in law school; otherwise, it achieved the same excellence.Without any extras, Shout presents the original CBS season in full. Time has not been completely kind to the film, as there is some faded quality; one or two episodes look a little more fresh. I wish there had been more an effort for preservation, but over time maybe that will happen. The film is still in good enough quality to not detract from the excellent writing and acting that was the hallmark of this series. It is based on the novel and film of the same name. Anyone who has seen the film will note many episodes in the film made their way into the first season on TV, although it is surprising the shrouding episode that made for such a strong pilot was not from the film but original. Hart and Kingsfield are more accessible on the TV series, although they remain essentially the same characters, particularly Kingsfield. James Stephens and Houseman are outstanding in those roles and carry the series, although the supporting cast are also excellent. I never understood why the cast playing the students never went on to bigger things. (I always thought Tom Fitzsimmons was always underrated; check out ""The Man Who Would Be King"" on Disc 1. Francine Tacker, Robert Ginty and James Keane had similar turns that were outstanding as well.)It was just a true joy to watch this series all over again. Hopefully, the Showtime episodes will follow, but for now enjoy the highlight of the 1978-79 television season.",5,One of TV's finest makes it to DVD,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",2009,2177,"['must', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'three', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'original', 'run', 'CBS', 'late', '70s', 'John', 'Houseman', 'later', 'wrote', 'correctly', 'was', 'well', 'reviewed', 'was', 'CBS', 'head', 'Bill', 'Paley', 'was', 'up', 'ABC', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'CBS', 'later', 'moved', 'weekend', 'where', 'began', 'pick', 'up', 'little', 'steam', 'then', 'dumped', 'back', 'graveyard', 'Happy', 'Days', 'insuring', 'death', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'loved', 'lived', 'life', 'reruns', 'PBS', 'elsewhere', 'Showtime', 'finally', 'picked', 'up', 'few', 'more', 'seasons', 'new', 'episodes', 'series', 'dropped', 'added', 'few', 'characters', 'changed', 'theme', 'advanced', 'plot', 'cover', 'Hart', 'remaining', 'years', 'law', 'school', 'otherwise', 'achieved', 'same', 'extras', 'Shout', 'original', 'CBS', 'season', 'full', 'Time', 'not', 'been', 'completely', 'kind', 'film', 'faded', 'quality', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'look', 'little', 'more', 'fresh', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'effort', 'preservation', 'time', 'maybe', 'will', 'happen', 'film', 'still', 'good', 'enough', 'quality', 'not', 'detract', 'excellent', 'writing', 'acting', 'was', 'hallmark', 'series', 'based', 'novel', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'note', 'many', 'episodes', 'film', 'made', 'way', 'first', 'season', 'TV', 'surprising', 'shrouding', 'episode', 'made', 'such', 'strong', 'pilot', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'original', 'Hart', 'Kingsfield', 'are', 'more', 'accessible', 'TV', 'series', 'remain', 'essentially', 'same', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Kingsfield', 'James', 'Stephens', 'Houseman', 'are', 'outstanding', 'roles', 'carry', 'series', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'cast', 'playing', 'students', 'never', 'went', 'bigger', 'things', 'always', 'thought', 'Tom', 'Fitzsimmons', 'was', 'always', 'underrated', 'check', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'Disc', '1', 'Francine', 'Tacker', 'Robert', 'Ginty', 'James', 'Keane', 'had', 'similar', 'turns', 'were', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'just', 'true', 'joy', 'watch', 'series', 'again', 'Hopefully', 'Showtime', 'episodes', 'will', 'follow', 'now', 'highlight', '1978-79', 'television', 'season']",The Paper Chase: Season 1
1222053,A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO,B001O4KBMI,E. Hornaday,"[85, 86]","Fans of Classic TV shows should rejoice with the release of The Paper Chase on DVD.Based on an unforgettable 1973 movie, the series focused on the lives of students struggling through law school at a prestigious university.The series lasted only one season on CBS with 22 episodes, from 1978 to 1979, and this boxed set from Shout!Factory collects those episodes, which revolves around the students' first year of 'trial' and tribulatios.PBS reran the series then the cable channel Showtime revived the series in 1983, where it lasted for three more seasons.The series centered around student James T. Hart, a core cast of fellow-students, and one truly dominant force of nature in the form of a legendary law professor, Charles W. Kingsfield Jr., played beyond iconic perfection by the fabulous John Houseman.Houseman had starred as Kingsfield in the movie version, then unbelievably reprised the role on the small screen to the delight of his fans. Sadly, Houseman died a year after the Showtime incarnation of the series ended.Hart, played by James Stephens in the series, and by Timothy Bottoms in the movie, is a hard-working student from Minnesota whose background ill prepares him for the rough and tumble of law school.Hart is utterly terrified and fascinated by Kingsfield, who challenges his students so vigorously that he has become a legend in his own time, and his classes are both loathed and cherished.The professor, the undisputed authority on contract law, becomes an unwilling and unknowing mentor to Hart, who decides he will do anything he can to meet and exceed the expectations of the master legal-eagle. By the time the series ends on Showtime, Hart graduates.While the series explores the relationship between Hart and his co-students who form a study group, it is Houseman's Kingsfield that inhabits every inch of the show, even when he is not on screen - a lasting testimony to the actor's skill.Stephens and Bottoms have devoted fan bases who argue one actor's portrayal is the quintessential Hart. For me, Stephens brings a sensitivity and likeability that Bottoms does not. Of course, Stephens had many episodes to imbue the character with his style.In the series, Hart's best friend, Franklin Ford III, is played by Tom Fitzsimmons, while actors Willis Bell, James Keane, and Betty Harford, (Kingsfield's secretary) round out the core cast in the first season, which aired on CBS.The joy of the show was the great scripts which managed to combine humor, tension and incredible stress caused by constant, rigorous study, with friendship and deeper, philosophical issues brought up by the legal topics they were learning. In short, it was one of the best cancelled TV series EVER!This boxed set includes the 22 episodes from the CBS season: The Paper Chase Pilot; Great Expectations; The Man Who Would Be King; A Day in the Life of...; Voices of Silence; Nancy; Da Da; The Seating Chart; Moot Court; Kingsfield's Daughter; The Sorcerer's Apprentice; Bell and Love; An Act of Desperation; Losing Streak; The Man in the Chair; A Matter of Honor; The Apprentice; Once More With Feeling; The Clay Footed Idol; The Tables Down at Ernie's; A Case of D&eacute;tente; and Scavenger Hunt.",5,"Finally, the Law Comes to DVD!!",1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,3207,"['Fans', 'Classic', 'TV', 'shows', 'should', 'rejoice', 'release', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'DVD.Based', 'unforgettable', '1973', 'movie', 'series', 'focused', 'lives', 'students', 'struggling', 'law', 'school', 'prestigious', 'university.The', 'series', 'lasted', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'CBS', '22', 'episodes', '1978', '1979', 'boxed', 'set', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'collects', 'episodes', 'students', 'first', 'year', ""'trial"", 'tribulatios.PBS', 'reran', 'series', 'then', 'cable', 'channel', 'Showtime', 'revived', 'series', '1983', 'where', 'lasted', 'three', 'more', 'seasons.The', 'series', 'centered', 'student', 'James', 'T.', 'Hart', 'core', 'cast', 'fellow-students', 'one', 'truly', 'dominant', 'force', 'nature', 'form', 'legendary', 'law', 'professor', 'Charles', 'W.', 'Kingsfield', 'Jr.', 'played', 'iconic', 'perfection', 'fabulous', 'John', 'Houseman.Houseman', 'had', 'starred', 'Kingsfield', 'movie', 'version', 'then', 'unbelievably', 'reprised', 'role', 'small', 'screen', 'delight', 'fans', 'Sadly', 'Houseman', 'died', 'year', 'Showtime', 'incarnation', 'series', 'ended.Hart', 'played', 'James', 'Stephens', 'series', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'movie', 'hard-working', 'student', 'Minnesota', 'background', 'ill', 'rough', 'tumble', 'law', 'school.Hart', 'utterly', 'terrified', 'fascinated', 'Kingsfield', 'who', 'students', 'so', 'vigorously', 'become', 'legend', 'own', 'time', 'classes', 'are', 'loathed', 'cherished.The', 'professor', 'undisputed', 'authority', 'contract', 'law', 'unwilling', 'unknowing', 'mentor', 'Hart', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'can', 'meet', 'exceed', 'expectations', 'master', 'legal-eagle', 'time', 'series', 'Showtime', 'Hart', 'series', 'relationship', 'Hart', 'co-students', 'who', 'form', 'study', 'group', 'Houseman', 'Kingsfield', 'inch', 'show', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'screen', 'lasting', 'testimony', 'actor', 'skill.Stephens', 'Bottoms', 'have', 'devoted', 'fan', 'bases', 'who', 'argue', 'one', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'quintessential', 'Hart', 'Stephens', 'sensitivity', 'likeability', 'Bottoms', 'not', 'course', 'Stephens', 'had', 'many', 'episodes', 'imbue', 'character', 'style.In', 'series', 'Hart', 'best', 'friend', 'Franklin', 'Ford', 'III', 'played', 'Tom', 'Fitzsimmons', 'actors', 'Willis', 'Bell', 'James', 'Keane', 'Betty', 'Harford', 'Kingsfield', 'secretary', 'round', 'core', 'cast', 'first', 'season', 'aired', 'CBS.The', 'joy', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'scripts', 'managed', 'combine', 'humor', 'tension', 'incredible', 'stress', 'caused', 'constant', 'rigorous', 'study', 'friendship', 'deeper', 'philosophical', 'issues', 'brought', 'up', 'legal', 'topics', 'were', 'learning', 'short', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'cancelled', 'TV', 'series', 'EVER', 'boxed', 'set', '22', 'episodes', 'CBS', 'season', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'Pilot', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'Day', 'Life', 'Voices', 'Silence', 'Nancy', 'Da', 'Da', 'Seating', 'Chart', 'Moot', 'Court', 'Kingsfield', 'Daughter', 'Sorcerer', 'Apprentice', 'Bell', 'Love', 'Act', 'Desperation', 'Losing', 'Streak', 'Man', 'Chair', 'A', 'Matter', 'Honor', 'Apprentice', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'Clay', 'Footed', 'Idol', 'Tables', 'Down', 'Ernie', 'Case', 'D', 'eacute', 'Scavenger', 'Hunt']",The Paper Chase: Season 1

It centers around James Hart, a promising 1L who goes to classes held by Professor Kingsfield. The episodes discuss the law and what it means, not to mention the pitfalls the students run into. A great program, Paper Chase made me want to be a lawyer when I was a teenager, although the more I saw it the more I had reservations!The character of Kingsfield is a powerful one. He plays the seemingly all-knowing professor, the man who has a ready barb for any student who gives the wrong answer or, worse, is unprepared for class.

Thank you, lords.This show, in a big way, helped me survive the eighth grade. I'd just moved to a new school, hated it, and the academic structure wasn't something I was used to. I hated everything. Then this show came along just at the right time. It sounds corny, but it really helped me believe others out there had it just as bad or worse, the rigors of a tough new school.For an hour every Tuesday? night, this show gave me respite from my troubles. It really helped.Was it a perfect show? Uh, no. Re-watching some of the episodes has made that clear. The dialogue was clunky, the photography dark at times and the plotlines a little silly at times. But overall it was a damn fine show.A few observations of my first show from 1978:- Hart looks just like a grown-up Jody from Family Affair. Hart was the moral center of the show, the earnest midwesterner who does most everything right, and is just a nice guy.- The actor who played Bell, James Keane, had some of the most limited acting range of all time. His face almost never changed expression.-Logan was a little annoying, with her never-smile persona and stern voice. The woman who played Logan, married Robert Ginty, the guy who played Anderson, in real life. They were married three years in the 80s before divorcing.-Anderson was your classic prick type of guy, but played the character well.-Ford nicely played the rich, lawyer-by-birthright kid with a brahmin accent.And of course, Professor Kingsfield, the great John Houseman. Every time I thought my new teachers were too tough, I'd remember Kingsfield and feel not as bad.Boy, was he a grumpy old man on the show. And the way he treated his secretary - Mrs. Nottingham - probably would get him fired for discrimination in today's work world. I always loved his dismissive ""good days"" to people.A few other weird things:-The girl, Deka Beaudine, who got a special ""As Asheley"" at the end of the opening credits was almost never in the show. Why was that? Why did she get the special credit?-look for the girl who played Samantha in Sex in the City in one Disc 2 episode, where she plays a student's wife. She's got black hair then.-",5,"Some flaws, but overall a great time capsule",1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,2306,"['Well', 'only', 'took', '30', 'years.For', 'longest', 'time', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'classic', 'be', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'finally', 'good', 'lords', 'Hollywood', 'capitulated', 'Thank', 'lords.This', 'show', 'big', 'way', 'helped', 'survive', 'eighth', 'grade', ""'d"", 'just', 'moved', 'new', 'school', 'hated', 'academic', 'structure', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'was', 'used', 'hated', 'everything', 'Then', 'show', 'came', 'along', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'corny', 'really', 'helped', 'believe', 'others', 'there', 'had', 'just', 'bad', 'worse', 'rigors', 'tough', 'new', 'school.For', 'hour', 'Tuesday', 'night', 'show', 'gave', 'respite', 'troubles', 'really', 'perfect', 'show', 'Uh', 'Re-watching', 'episodes', 'made', 'clear', 'dialogue', 'was', 'clunky', 'photography', 'dark', 'times', 'plotlines', 'little', 'silly', 'times', 'overall', 'was', 'damn', 'fine', 'show.A', 'few', 'observations', 'first', 'show', '1978', 'Hart', 'just', 'grown-up', 'Jody', 'Family', 'Affair', 'Hart', 'was', 'moral', 'center', 'show', 'earnest', 'midwesterner', 'who', 'most', 'everything', 'right', 'just', 'nice', 'guy.-', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Bell', 'James', 'Keane', 'had', 'most', 'limited', 'acting', 'range', 'time', 'face', 'almost', 'never', 'changed', 'expression.-Logan', 'was', 'little', 'annoying', 'never-smile', 'persona', 'stern', 'voice', 'woman', 'who', 'played', 'Logan', 'married', 'Robert', 'Ginty', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Anderson', 'real', 'life', 'were', 'married', 'three', 'years', '80s', 'divorcing.-Anderson', 'was', 'classic', 'prick', 'type', 'guy', 'played', 'character', 'well.-Ford', 'nicely', 'played', 'rich', 'lawyer-by-birthright', 'kid', 'brahmin', 'accent.And', 'course', 'Professor', 'Kingsfield', 'great', 'John', 'Houseman', 'Every', 'time', 'thought', 'new', 'teachers', 'were', 'too', 'tough', ""'d"", 'remember', 'Kingsfield', 'feel', 'not', 'bad.Boy', 'was', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'show', 'way', 'treated', 'secretary', 'Mrs.', 'Nottingham', 'probably', 'would', 'get', 'fired', 'discrimination', 'today', 'work', 'world', 'always', 'loved', 'dismissive', 'good', 'days', 'people.A', 'few', 'other', 'weird', 'things', '-The', 'girl', 'Deka', 'Beaudine', 'who', 'got', 'special', 'Asheley', 'end', 'opening', 'credits', 'was', 'almost', 'never', 'show', 'Why', 'was', 'Why', 'did', 'get', 'special', 'credit', '-look', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Samantha', 'Sex', 'City', 'one', 'Disc', '2', 'episode', 'where', 'student', 'wife', 'got', 'black', 'hair', 'then.-']",The Paper Chase: Season 1

What happened in law school was a complete mystery to me, one which I had little or no interest in trying to solve.  Nevertheless,I remember tuning in the pilot episode out of curiosity, and I was hooked from the first five minutes.Set in a never named but obviously Ivy League university, The Paper Chase followed the vicissitudes of first year law student James Hart, a Midwesterner unaccustomed to the sophistication and traditions of an Eastern law school.  On his first day he ran afoul of the celebrated Professor Kingsfield, and his efforts to regain his standing with the professor and save his law school career were riveting to watch.After that episode I had an ironclad appointment to watch The Paper Chase every week.  The series had wit as well as drama and never insulted the intelligence of its viewers, something most TV viewers in the 1970s were accustomed to find only on PBS. The actors were really actors, not TV ""stars"", especially John Houseman.  When The Paper Chase was cancelled after one season I was broken hearted and never found its match on commercial TV.Although my career path never included law school, nevertheless I received an education in quality entertainment from The Paper Chase.",5,Television At Its Finest,1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,1296,"['was', 'college', 'when', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'premiered', 'fall', '1978', 'What', 'happened', 'law', 'school', 'was', 'complete', 'mystery', 'one', 'had', 'little', 'interest', 'trying', 'solve', 'Nevertheless', 'remember', 'tuning', 'pilot', 'episode', 'curiosity', 'was', 'hooked', 'first', 'five', 'minutes.Set', 'never', 'named', 'obviously', 'Ivy', 'League', 'university', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'followed', 'vicissitudes', 'first', 'year', 'law', 'student', 'James', 'Hart', 'Midwesterner', 'unaccustomed', 'sophistication', 'traditions', 'Eastern', 'law', 'school', 'first', 'day', 'ran', 'afoul', 'celebrated', 'Professor', 'Kingsfield', 'efforts', 'regain', 'standing', 'professor', 'save', 'law', 'school', 'career', 'were', 'riveting', 'watch.After', 'episode', 'had', 'ironclad', 'appointment', 'watch', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'week', 'series', 'had', 'wit', 'as', 'well', 'drama', 'never', 'insulted', 'intelligence', 'viewers', 'something', 'most', 'TV', 'viewers', '1970s', 'were', 'accustomed', 'find', 'only', 'PBS', 'actors', 'were', 'really', 'actors', 'not', 'TV', 'stars', 'especially', 'John', 'Houseman', 'When', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'was', 'cancelled', 'one', 'season', 'was', 'broken', 'hearted', 'never', 'found', 'match', 'commercial', 'TV.Although', 'career', 'path', 'never', 'included', 'law', 'school', 'nevertheless', 'received', 'education', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'Paper', 'Chase']",The Paper Chase: Season 1

Most of those glowing reviews are from folks who are gushing about how elated they are to finally get their hands on a show they haven't watched in 30 years.  They are just waxing nostalgic for the good old days.Well, I saw a few episodes of this show in its first season on TV too.  I liked them a lot, especially the ""Scavenger Hunt"" episode.  But I was twelve years old at the time.  When you are 12 and grew up with only 3 or 4 channels of TV programming, almost every show was good.  You carry those fond memories of watching the show with you through the rest of your years --- until you are in your early forties and watch the show again...""The Paper Chase - Season 1"" doesn't hold up as well as I hoped it would. It was interesting to revisit the show, but I'm watching the episodes with a far more ""dramatically sophisticated"" eye.  The storylines are fine, but the dialogue and directing styles are dated, thin, and weak compared to what I'm used to now.  Again, good stories but too often the dialogue seems weak.  After watching great drama like ""NYPD Blue"", ""The Wire"", etc, it is hard to watch this late-Seventies series and not snicker a bit at how comparatively hokey it is.  It may not have seemed hokey at the time, but the passage of time has not been good to the show.The actors are earnest enough, but they are undermined by the now-dated style of televised drama from that era.I don't remember seeing the show when it was resurrected on Showtime years later.  Maybe those seasons hold up better.  I can't say because I don't know.Don't get me wrong -- I'm not saying that all contemporary dramas are better than the stuff from the Seventies.  There is some stuff on TV today that is pure drivel.  But it just turns out that the first season of ""The Paper Chase"" had an excellent concept but was executed in a style that would not stay fresh this long.  Oddly, the movie still holds up well.It is fun to watch the show for the nostalgia, that's for sure.

1222063,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B001O4KBMI,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[5, 5]","Television has become a time machine for me like visiting an old friend and you're able to go back to a time and place. The problem with nostalgia is that maybe the friend isn't as you remember them or you discover it was only the time and place that made you friends. The Paper Chase TV series came along at a formative time of my life and I remember it with fond memories.While the movie The Paper Chase was more of a 60's parable on the absurdities of the chase after the ephemeral materialistic goals of society, the series is much more about the human stories behind the students, behind the discipline of studying the law, a much more late 70's view point or even a new century point of view.The series follows James Hart, an idealistic student of the law and his study group through the rigors of an unnamed but prestigious east coast law school, where Hart's nemesis is contracts law Professor Kingsfield. The stories examine aspects of life through the prism of contracts law. The series not only presented dramas but all the elements of life love stories such as when Hart falls in love with Logan. There are humorous episodes such as when Bell decides that Kingsfield is picking on him because of a goofy picture on the seating chart and enlists Hart to help him change the picture and they end up trapped for a weekend in Kingsfield's closet. There's a look at what it's like to be a law student, such as the moot court episode, and issue oriented episodes that present both sides of the issue.The casting is superb, John Houseman seems to have been born to play Kingsfield, the dignified, unbending law Professor. It's hard to imagine that Houseman had once been a firebrand actor and colleague of Orson Welles. James Stephens perfectly embodies the idealistic eagerness of Hart, Tom Fitzsimmons as Ford, the legacy student with a family tradition to uphold, Robert Ginty (who would later go on to the TV series Baa Baa Black Sheep) as Hart's friend, James Keane as Bell the goofy underdog who everybody underestimates. Keane would later be seen in a lot of movies in the 80's usually as a cop. Francine Tacker as Elizabeth Logan feminist student and occasional love interest to Hart, and Jonathon Segal as Brooks the married student who is on the verge of flunking out and unfortunately Segal's character mirrors the character's place in the show a little too closely and is given short shrift in the series except for the episode, An Act of Desperation. And like a lot of TV series you can find actors in bit parts who go on to bigger things, such as Marilou Henner as a waitress in the pilot episode in a role that probably would have been bigger in the series had she not gone to make Grease, Kim Cattrall shows up pre-Porky's and, of course, Sex In The City.There aren't any bonus features which was initially a little disappointing but as I watched the episodes the overall quality of the show more than makes up for a making of featurette.The Paper Chase has always been a quality show produced by James L Brooks and a few of the episodes written by the novel's author John Jay Osborn Jr, it received the fate of a lot of quality shows that have been on TV, cancellation. The show was revived by PBS and future seasons found their way on to the air. So whether you're looking to rediscover an old friend, or make a new one, the first season of The Paper Chase is a good start.",5,Law School With A Lot of Hart,1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,3396,"['Television', 'become', 'time', 'machine', 'visiting', 'old', 'friend', ""'re"", 'able', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'place', 'problem', 'nostalgia', 'maybe', 'friend', ""n't"", 'remember', 'discover', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'place', 'made', 'friends', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'TV', 'series', 'came', 'along', 'formative', 'time', 'life', 'remember', 'fond', 'movie', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'was', 'more', '60', 'parable', 'absurdities', 'chase', 'ephemeral', 'materialistic', 'goals', 'society', 'series', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'stories', 'students', 'discipline', 'studying', 'law', 'much', 'more', 'late', '70', 'view', 'point', 'even', 'new', 'century', 'point', 'view.The', 'series', 'James', 'Hart', 'idealistic', 'student', 'law', 'study', 'group', 'rigors', 'unnamed', 'prestigious', 'east', 'coast', 'law', 'school', 'where', 'Hart', 'nemesis', 'contracts', 'law', 'Professor', 'Kingsfield', 'stories', 'examine', 'aspects', 'life', 'prism', 'contracts', 'law', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'presented', 'dramas', 'elements', 'life', 'love', 'stories', 'such', 'when', 'Hart', 'love', 'Logan', 'are', 'humorous', 'episodes', 'such', 'when', 'Bell', 'Kingsfield', 'picking', 'goofy', 'picture', 'seating', 'chart', 'enlists', 'Hart', 'help', 'change', 'picture', 'end', 'up', 'trapped', 'weekend', 'Kingsfield', 'closet', 'look', 'what', 'be', 'law', 'student', 'such', 'moot', 'court', 'episode', 'issue', 'oriented', 'episodes', 'present', 'sides', 'issue.The', 'casting', 'superb', 'John', 'Houseman', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'play', 'Kingsfield', 'dignified', 'unbending', 'law', 'Professor', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Houseman', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'firebrand', 'actor', 'colleague', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'James', 'Stephens', 'perfectly', 'idealistic', 'eagerness', 'Hart', 'Tom', 'Fitzsimmons', 'Ford', 'legacy', 'student', 'family', 'tradition', 'uphold', 'Robert', 'Ginty', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'go', 'TV', 'series', 'Baa', 'Baa', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'Hart', 'friend', 'James', 'Keane', 'Bell', 'goofy', 'underdog', 'who', 'everybody', 'Keane', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', '80', 'usually', 'cop', 'Francine', 'Tacker', 'Elizabeth', 'Logan', 'feminist', 'student', 'occasional', 'love', 'interest', 'Hart', 'Jonathon', 'Segal', 'Brooks', 'married', 'student', 'who', 'verge', 'flunking', 'out', 'unfortunately', 'Segal', 'character', 'character', 'place', 'show', 'little', 'too', 'closely', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'series', 'episode', 'Act', 'Desperation', 'lot', 'TV', 'series', 'can', 'find', 'actors', 'bit', 'parts', 'who', 'go', 'bigger', 'things', 'such', 'Marilou', 'Henner', 'waitress', 'pilot', 'episode', 'role', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bigger', 'series', 'had', 'not', 'gone', 'make', 'Grease', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'up', 'pre-Porky', 'course', 'Sex', 'City.There', 'are', ""n't"", 'bonus', 'features', 'was', 'initially', 'little', 'disappointing', 'watched', 'episodes', 'overall', 'quality', 'show', 'more', 'up', 'making', 'featurette.The', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'always', 'been', 'quality', 'show', 'produced', 'James', 'L', 'Brooks', 'few', 'episodes', 'written', 'novel', 'author', 'John', 'Jay', 'Osborn', 'Jr', 'received', 'fate', 'lot', 'quality', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'TV', 'cancellation', 'show', 'was', 'revived', 'PBS', 'future', 'seasons', 'found', 'way', 'air', ""'re"", 'looking', 'rediscover', 'old', 'friend', 'make', 'new', 'one', 'first', 'season', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'good', 'start']",The Paper Chase: Season 1
1222064,A28V2CQXWPXIR0,B001O4KBMI,Kert Conrad,"[2, 2]","It's great to see THE PAPER CHASE finally get an official DVD release after all these years.  The series has long been one of my top five favorite TV shows and I'm glad that those who missed the original broadcasts will now get a chance to see and appreciate the academic adventures of James Hart and his fellow law students.There are many reasons that THE PAPER CHASE stands as one of the best dramas ever seen on television, but its main attraction is definitely the performance of John Houseman as Professor Kingsfield.  His unique delivery and commanding presence make him a truly monumental figure.  Praise should also go to James Stephens, who is outstanding as the quietly intense and ambitious Mr. Hart.  The key to the enduring popularity of both the series and the original movie, though, is the fascinating mix of camaraderie and competition between the characters: friends on one hand, rivals on the other.One viewer has commented that after seeing the show for the first time since its premiere, the series doesn't live up to his memories, and that the scripts and direction don't measure up to the television dramas of recent years.  In truth, though, this could be said about virtually any older program if you view it strictly with a modern eye.  Every movie or TV show reflects the styles and conventions of the time in which it was produced .  Take the first-season episodes of the original STAR TREK or HAWAII FIVE-O, for example.  By today's standards, some of the dialogue and plot elements may seem dated, simplistic or even silly.  However, this in no way makes the shows any less interesting or enjoyable.  It's best to watch them on their own terms.  Likewise with THE PAPER CHASE: in retrospect it may seem to lack a bit of an edge, and perhaps it didn't realize its full potential, but it's a great series nonetheless.Those who never saw the episodes produced for Showtime in the early 80's are probably wondering how they compare to the first-year CBS segments included in this new DVD set.  Actually the producers did an excellent job of continuing the story in the same spirit while making logical changes to mirror the progress of the students as they advanced through law school.  In the second year, Hart and Ford leave the dorms and rent a place off campus, while Bell stays behind and becomes Dorm Advisor.  The later episodes tend to have better classroom scenes where the students actually discuss legal concepts and questions, rather than simply stating ""the facts of the case"".  On the negative side, however, the teamwork and friendship between members of the study group, which was a vital element of the first year, is missing from the Showtime productions.As for Shout Factory's DVD presentation, the set is nicely packaged and contains a helpful booklet containing plot descriptions and credits.  Strangely, only a select number of the episodes appear to have been remastered, but the picture quality is decent throughout and certainly an improvement over the bootleg copies that have been available up to now.

1222065,AX2HYDONXKWGY,B001O4KBMI,K. Simms,"[0, 0]","I purchased season 1 of Paper Chase not expecting much, but I was presently surprised after viewing the first few episodes. Paperchase presents very well-written stories about a group of first year law school students who form a study group. The series is especially focused on Hart, a well-liked, intelligent student from a farm in the Midwest. The series deals with the typical grad school stuff: studying, maintaining a social life, killer professors. However it delves into serious social issues such as affirmative action, the cold war, and women's rights. One of my favorites is the episode on affirmative action when Hart realizes that as a student from a farm he is also a recipient of affirmative action - something that tends to escape many opponents of this issue. The highlight of the PaperChase is professor Kingsfield - the kind of professor you wish for. He is a tough grader who demands the best from his students. He maintains a harsh exterior but goes to great lengths to stand up for his students and support them without taking credit. Overall this series is not fast paced and there are a couple of ""duds"" (plots that really don't go anywhere or makes sense), but it is a highly amusing series and now I am off to buy the next season.",5,Great Series,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,1255,"['purchased', 'season', '1', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'was', 'presently', 'surprised', 'viewing', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Paperchase', 'very', 'well-written', 'stories', 'group', 'first', 'year', 'law', 'school', 'students', 'who', 'form', 'study', 'group', 'series', 'especially', 'focused', 'Hart', 'well-liked', 'intelligent', 'student', 'farm', 'Midwest', 'series', 'deals', 'typical', 'grad', 'school', 'stuff', 'studying', 'maintaining', 'social', 'life', 'killer', 'professors', 'However', 'serious', 'social', 'issues', 'such', 'affirmative', 'action', 'cold', 'war', 'women', 'rights', 'One', 'favorites', 'episode', 'affirmative', 'action', 'when', 'Hart', 'student', 'farm', 'also', 'recipient', 'affirmative', 'action', 'something', 'escape', 'many', 'opponents', 'issue', 'highlight', 'PaperChase', 'professor', 'Kingsfield', 'kind', 'professor', 'wish', 'tough', 'grader', 'who', 'best', 'students', 'harsh', 'exterior', 'great', 'lengths', 'stand', 'up', 'students', 'support', 'taking', 'credit', 'Overall', 'series', 'not', 'fast', 'paced', 'are', 'couple', 'duds', 'plots', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'sense', 'highly', 'amusing', 'series', 'now', 'am', 'off', 'buy', 'next', 'season']",The Paper Chase: Season 1

I have one show that I taped on VHS back in 1979, which I had been watching, hoping and praying for the DVD set to be released. And now it has!! This is simply television drama at its best, the ensemble, headed by the great John Houseman,reprising the character of the fascinatingly brilliant curmudgeon Kingsfield, who both teaches and torments his students to become the best that they can be, is a tour de force acting triumph. His Academy Award was well deserved. His presence in the series gives a bit more humor and interest, building the character as the episodes progress, than that of the motion picture. James Stephens, in my opinion, is the quintessential Hart, giving more sensitivity and naivete than the portrayal by Bottoms, with a bit more of a moral edge. The rest of the students in the study group are also much more effective and likeable than those in the motion picture. I felt the motion picture study group was very one dimensional, we only saw arrogant Harvard kids. But the television series study group is a bit more diverse, allowed to develop into interesting personalities we grew to love, with lots of humor and pathos, especially the character of the luckless Willis Bell --remember ""Liberty"" Bell?. One of the best episodes in this set is ""The Seating Chart"" which illustrates the understated and comedic talent of James Keane, who played Bell. All of the actors are excellent and blend well as an ensemble. I can't wait to purchase this set, it is well worth the money.  Not hard to understand why this program was voted Outstanding New Series. Of course one knew that it would be cancelled by the network, it was way before its time.

It's not perfect--as other reviews note, it does look dated and often the writing is a bit unrealistic, but there has been little else like it ever on television. The closest comparison in tone would be the 1970s show ""The White Shadow,"" which was about a high school basketball coach trying to guide his students, mixed with the quirky camaraderie of a more serious  ""Welcome Back Kotter,"" where goofy multicultural students try to impress their teacher. This doesn't have violence or action; it's not preachy; it just allows the bigger-than-life characters (particularly John Houseman's professor) to speak intelligently and with subtle humor.The cast is huge--it's hard to believe that network TV back then could afford to employ so many actors.  There are at least eight regulars and others that appear often, plus generous crowds of students in the background as the campus is shown.Some may think this hasn't aged well because it is really a period piece--it's hard to believe any professor today could get away with saying some of the things Houseman says, and is just as difficult to swallow how naive the new law students were in their first year back then.  But it does reflect pieces of reality from the 1970s, when law students couldn't afford to call home, were intimidated by teachers and each other, and were stuck eating cafeteria food.One thing that's a bit disappointing is the somewhat stilted writing of creator John Jay Osborne, who is now a law professor in San Francisco.  He wasn't a trained TV writer, but was known for his novel on which the movie and series were based.  He writes a handful of the episodes and had some interesting plots but didn't quite know how to script for TV and at times plot threads go without resolution in the self-contained hours.Otherwise this is a great buy for those who enjoy a little intellectual stimulation with their nostalgia.

Thirty years later it's still a good show, but its flaws are more obvious. The show is remarkably naive, chaste, and dewy-eyed, which detracts somewhat from its realism. The scenes in Kingsfield's class are entertaining, but the level of discussion and the manner of presentation seem more appropriate for a high school than a top law school (presumably Harvard). Many of the shows are based on an issue (minority student, handicapped student, sexual harrassment-a particularly awful episode-cheating students, etc.) and the show is addicted to last minute changes of heart in order to bring about a happy ending in 45 minutes. Still, it's a very good show, well worth seeing. Somehow John Houseman manages to dominate the show despite a performance that runs the emotional gamut from A to B.  The rest of the actors are quite good.  The rating above applies to the show, not to the quality of the DVD tranhsfer, which is at times fuzzy and out-of-sync.

The episodes are several cuts above pretty much any other TV series in terms of their intellectual content, and occasionally manage the difficult trick of being humorous, uplifting, and inspiring at the same time.

It maintained an incredible level of excellence from the first season through its Showtime years.Based on the novel by John Jay Osborn Jr.The Paper Chaseand the motion picture of the bookThe Paper Chase, the television series far surpasses the quality of its predecessors. It reminds me in some ways of ""M*A*S*H,"" the series, which was far and away better than its original book and movie. Unfortunately, unlike ""M*A*S*H,"" once Showtime finished ""The Paper Chase"" more than 20 years ago, it has been rarely seen since. It is so well written, so well acted, so compelling and dramatic, that it deserves a chance to find a new audience on DVD.If you watched it in its day and liked it, please purchase a copy and show the distributor (Shout Factory) that there is a market for the rest of the series. Even if you did not see it when it first aired, but you appreciate intelligent, thought-provoking drama, give it a try and spread the word. You don't have to be a lawyer or law student to identify with the characters and the daily events in which they find themselves. It's a story and television series for all of us.",5,Deserves Your Attention,1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,1788,"['others', 'have', 'written', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'compelling', 'dramas', 'ever', 'made', 'television', 'critical', 'darling', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'was', 'really', 'too', 'intelligent', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'large', 'enough', 'audience', 'CBS', 'However', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'die', 'quietly', 'gaining', 'more', 'kudos', 'reruns', 'PBS', 'Showtime', 'brought', 'back', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'luring', 'back', 'key', 'players', 'first', 'season', 'continue', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'Second', 'Year', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'Third', 'Year', 'Showtime', 'finished', 'run', 'final', 'six', 'episodes', 'called', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'Graduation', 'Year', 'was', 'actually', 'continuation', 'third', 'year', 'maintained', 'incredible', 'level', 'excellence', 'first', 'season', 'Showtime', 'years.Based', 'novel', 'John', 'Jay', 'Osborn', 'Jr.The', 'Paper', 'Chaseand', 'motion', 'picture', 'bookThe', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'television', 'series', 'far', 'quality', 'predecessors', 'ways', 'M*A*S*H', 'series', 'was', 'far', 'away', 'better', 'original', 'book', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'M*A*S*H', 'once', 'Showtime', 'finished', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'more', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'been', 'rarely', 'seen', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'compelling', 'dramatic', 'chance', 'find', 'new', 'audience', 'DVD.If', 'watched', 'day', 'liked', 'please', 'purchase', 'copy', 'show', 'distributor', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'market', 'rest', 'series', 'Even', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'appreciate', 'intelligent', 'thought-provoking', 'drama', 'give', 'try', 'spread', 'word', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'lawyer', 'law', 'student', 'identify', 'characters', 'daily', 'events', 'find', 'story', 'television', 'series']",The Paper Chase: Season 1

1222078,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,B001O4KBMI,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[5, 6]","XXXXX""The study of law is something new and unfamiliar to most of you, unlike any other schooling you have ever known before.  You teach yourselves the law, but I train your minds.  You come in here with a skull full of mush and if you survive, you leave thinking like a lawyer.""The above is found at the beginning of each episode of this television series.  This series is based on the novel by John Jay Osborn, Jr. as well as the 1973 movie (directed by James Bridges) of the same name.It follows the lives of first-year law student Hart (James Stephens) at an unnamed, elite law school and the other members of his study group.  Hart's nemesis is Professor Kingsfield (John Houseman who reprised his Oscar-winning performance from the movie), the world's leading authority on contract law.  (The above opening narrative is uttered by Kingsfield).Besides Hart, the other members of the study group are Ford (Tom Fitzsimmons), Anderson (Robert Ginty), Bell  (James Keane), Logan (Francine Tacker), and Brooks (Jonathan Segal).  (Note that in the pilot episode, there was O'Conner instead of Logan and this part was played by a different actress.  Also note that J. Segal who played Brooks eventually left the series thus reducing the number of study group members to five.)This show tackled a number of big issues such as sexual harassment, affirmative action, equal rights for women, and what it's like to be a law student and disabled while also devoting time to other subjects such as cheating, the demands of academia, and romantic entanglements.On top of this, there is strong acting (especially by Housemen who was aged 76), well-rounded characterizations, and many guest stars who are given memorable roles and an opportunity to really shine in their episodes.  The writing and the story telling are simply great.  (Note that James Bridges, who developed this series for television, wrote two episodes while John Jay Osborn, who was technical advisor, wrote four episodes and co-wrote one episode.)One thing the series lacks is continuity meaning that new characters have to be introduced and written out in one episode and, as well, all the story lines have to draw to a conclusion before the end credits roll.  This was not the show's fault but how episodic television was written during this time period.Of all the episodes, there was only two I did not care for.  (In one of these episodes, Houseman does not even appear!)For show quality alone, this series deserves a solid 5 stars.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the picture quality which is variable.  Some episodes are clear, other not so clear.  The colours are a bit faded and there are occasional scratches and spots.  However, the series is still quite viewable.For picture quality alone, this series deserves, in my opinion, 3 stars.The audio is better but there are some distortions in a few episodes.  You have to turn up the volume when watching all episodes.  Despite this, the dialog is easy to make out.For audio quality alone, this series perhaps should be given 4 stars.My final rating is an average of the above three ratings.One thing I should mention is each shows length.  It says on the cardboard storage case that each episode is ""one hour long.""  Yes, this was with the commercials.  But in this set, there are no commercials (thank goodness!).  It turns out, when rounding to the nearest minute, that the majority of the episodes are (48 minutes) long with some being either (46 or 47 minutes) long.  (Note that the opening and closing credits combined take between (2 minutes) and (2 minutes, 30 seconds).)Another thing I would do before watching this series is to watch the excellent movie the series is based on.  The series uses many of the elements found in the movie.  You'll also notice some interesting differences.There are no extras, no subtitles, and no closed captioning.Finally, some say this series is only for wannabe lawyers or lawyers.  UNTRUE.  This series is for anybody with intelligence.In conclusion, in my opinion this is an intelligent, warm, top-notch television series.  In fact, it was hailed by critics as the best new series of that season!  As you can imagine, a show of this calibre was cancelled but fortunately was picked up by a pay-cable network years later.  I'm looking forward to seeing season two!!(1978-1979; about 1050 minutes or 17.5 hours; 6 discs; 22 episodes; full screen)&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",4,"A television series for those that don't have ""a skull full of mush""",1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,4468,"['XXXXX', 'study', 'law', 'something', 'new', 'unfamiliar', 'most', 'other', 'schooling', 'have', 'ever', 'known', 'before', 'teach', 'law', 'train', 'minds', 'come', 'here', 'skull', 'full', 'mush', 'survive', 'leave', 'thinking', 'lawyer', 'above', 'found', 'beginning', 'episode', 'television', 'series', 'series', 'based', 'novel', 'John', 'Jay', 'Osborn', 'Jr.', 'as', 'well', '1973', 'movie', 'directed', 'James', 'Bridges', 'same', 'name.It', 'lives', 'first-year', 'law', 'student', 'Hart', 'James', 'Stephens', 'unnamed', 'elite', 'law', 'school', 'other', 'members', 'study', 'group', 'Hart', 'nemesis', 'Professor', 'Kingsfield', 'John', 'Houseman', 'who', 'reprised', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'movie', 'world', 'leading', 'authority', 'contract', 'law', 'opening', 'narrative', 'uttered', 'Kingsfield', 'Hart', 'other', 'members', 'study', 'group', 'are', 'Ford', 'Tom', 'Fitzsimmons', 'Anderson', 'Robert', 'Ginty', 'Bell', 'James', 'Keane', 'Logan', 'Francine', 'Tacker', 'Brooks', 'Jonathan', 'Segal', 'Note', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', ""O'Conner"", 'instead', 'Logan', 'part', 'was', 'played', 'different', 'actress', 'Also', 'note', 'J.', 'Segal', 'who', 'played', 'Brooks', 'eventually', 'left', 'series', 'thus', 'reducing', 'number', 'study', 'group', 'members', 'five', 'show', 'tackled', 'number', 'big', 'issues', 'such', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'affirmative', 'action', 'equal', 'rights', 'women', 'what', 'be', 'law', 'student', 'disabled', 'also', 'devoting', 'time', 'other', 'subjects', 'such', 'cheating', 'demands', 'academia', 'romantic', 'entanglements.On', 'top', 'strong', 'acting', 'especially', 'Housemen', 'who', 'was', 'aged', '76', 'well-rounded', 'characterizations', 'many', 'guest', 'stars', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'memorable', 'roles', 'opportunity', 'really', 'shine', 'episodes', 'writing', 'story', 'telling', 'are', 'simply', 'great', 'Note', 'James', 'Bridges', 'who', 'developed', 'series', 'television', 'wrote', 'two', 'episodes', 'John', 'Jay', 'Osborn', 'who', 'was', 'technical', 'advisor', 'wrote', 'four', 'episodes', 'co-wrote', 'one', 'episode', 'One', 'thing', 'series', 'continuity', 'meaning', 'new', 'characters', 'have', 'be', 'introduced', 'written', 'out', 'one', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'lines', 'have', 'draw', 'conclusion', 'end', 'roll', 'was', 'not', 'show', 'fault', 'how', 'episodic', 'television', 'was', 'written', 'time', 'episodes', 'was', 'only', 'two', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'one', 'episodes', 'Houseman', 'not', 'even', 'appear', 'show', 'quality', 'alone', 'series', 'solid', '5', 'stars.Unfortunately', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'picture', 'quality', 'variable', 'episodes', 'are', 'clear', 'other', 'not', 'so', 'clear', 'colours', 'are', 'bit', 'faded', 'are', 'occasional', 'scratches', 'spots', 'However', 'series', 'still', 'quite', 'viewable.For', 'picture', 'quality', 'alone', 'series', 'opinion', '3', 'stars.The', 'audio', 'better', 'are', 'distortions', 'few', 'episodes', 'have', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'when', 'watching', 'episodes', 'dialog', 'easy', 'make', 'out.For', 'audio', 'quality', 'alone', 'series', 'perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'given', '4', 'stars.My', 'final', 'rating', 'average', 'above', 'three', 'ratings.One', 'thing', 'should', 'mention', 'shows', 'length', 'cardboard', 'storage', 'case', 'episode', 'one', 'hour', 'long', 'Yes', 'was', 'commercials', 'set', 'are', 'commercials', 'thank', 'goodness', 'out', 'when', 'rounding', 'nearest', 'minute', 'majority', 'episodes', 'are', '48', 'minutes', 'long', 'being', '46', '47', 'minutes', 'long', 'Note', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'combined', 'take', '2', 'minutes', '2', 'minutes', '30', 'seconds', 'thing', 'would', 'do', 'watching', 'series', 'watch', 'excellent', 'movie', 'series', 'based', 'series', 'many', 'elements', 'found', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'also', 'notice', 'interesting', 'are', 'extras', 'subtitles', 'closed', 'captioning.Finally', 'say', 'series', 'only', 'wannabe', 'lawyers', 'lawyers', 'UNTRUE', 'series', 'anybody', 'intelligence.In', 'conclusion', 'opinion', 'intelligent', 'warm', 'top-notch', 'television', 'series', 'fact', 'was', 'hailed', 'critics', 'best', 'new', 'series', 'season', 'can', 'imagine', 'show', 'calibre', 'was', 'cancelled', 'fortunately', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'pay-cable', 'network', 'years', 'later', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'season', 'two', '1978-1979', '1050', 'minutes', '17.5', 'hours', '6', 'discs', '22', 'episodes', 'full', 'screen', 'lt', 'lt', 'Stephen', 'Pletko', 'London', 'Ontario', 'Canada', '>', '>', 'XXXXX']",The Paper Chase: Season 1
1222079,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B001O4KBMI,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[5, 5]","As I watch the DVDs that I just received I'm finding myself overjoyed at being able to watch this excellent series again as I've long wanted to be able to get the series on DVD or at least be able to find the series to watch again.  Sadly I've not seen the series available to watch on any of the broadcast or cable television networks that I receive, at least not in many, many years.  As another reviewer notes, 30 years have passed (as I write this) since the series originally aired, and in the intervening time many other shows have come and gone, so it's not that surprising not to have been able to find The Paper Chase available on television.  What is somewhat surprising is that it took as long as it has for the series to become available on DVD.I remember checking for the availability of this title (and a few other selected favorites that remain unavailable currently) and being disappointed that the best I could get was to sign up for notification that title was being released.  I had long ago done that, and was sad that it seemed that each time I checked back the status hadn't changed and I was still left waiting and wanting.Finally, in April 2009, the series is out in a 6 disc DVD set from Shout Factory.  6 discs with 22 episodes spread among them.  Sadly the video quality on these DVDs isn't as clean or pristine as one might expect in this modern digital era, with noise apparent throughout the various episodes.  The video on the DVDs basically shows it's age, though not really in a bad way.  Again, this material is 30 years old and was created during a time with less sophisticated recording technology and material.  I'm sure that if this series aired today we'd be enjoying it in high definition with all digital video and audio.For audio quality these discs are fine, though the material was again created in an era where the technology involved isn't what we have today.Which brings me back to the material on the discs and the quality of the episodes therein, and that is where these discs truly shine.  The Paper Chase, the Television Series, was some of the most compelling and thought provoking material ever aired on television.  Sadly, it was, as someone else notes here, ahead of its time and perhaps a bit too sophisticated for viewers that would rather watch situation comedies, and later reality television.I hope that sales of these discs go well and that we'll see the remaining seasons of the series released to disc as well.

1222080,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001O4KBMI,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I was a very young child when ""The Paper Chase"" TV show was airing, but I watched the movie as a teenager and just absolutely loved it. It was only recently that I became aware that a TV show was made based on the movie, and I am glad I checked it out because the series is very interesting and engaging. The talented John Houseman reprises his role as the dour and formidable Contracts professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. Timothy Bottoms's role is replaced by James Stephens (playing James Hart), the farm boy from Minnesota who takes Kingsfield's class because of Kingsfield's excellent reputation in the field. In the first episode, poor Hart is ""shrouded"" on his first day in Kingsfield's class, a death sentence of sorts because it renders him 'invisible' to Kingsfield (he won't call on any student that has been shrouded, and there's one student who suffers this every year). But Hart is made of sterner stuff and his indomitable and easy-going manner gets him through some very rough patches. He shares his law school experience with a group of classmates who come together in a study group and form close bonds as a result - Franklin Ford III (played by Tom Fitzsimmons) is an over-confident, rich guy whose family background is deeply rooted in law, and who faces intense pressure from his over-achieving dad; Thomas Anderson (played by Robert Ginty) is an arrogant and competitive guy who initially takes a dislike to Hart before hitting it off; the rest are Willis Bell (played by James Keane), Elizabeth Logan (played by Francine Tacker)the sole female in the study group, and Jonathan Brooks (played by Jonathan Segal) is the only married student in the group and his well-to-do young wife Asheley is played by Deka Beaudine.The dialogue is sharp and witty, and the acting is credible, especially by Houseman and Stephens. Though I liked Timothy Bottoms' portrayal in the movie, I love Stephens' portrayal as Hart - very down-to-earth and real, his performance is nuanced and well-portrayed. The others in the supporting roles are also very good. The only thing I felt could have been better was the picture quality which is what one would expect of a series filmed in the 70s. I wish they had done a better job of restoring the picture quality instead of the rather grainy and washed out version we get here. The audio quality is passable, but not very sharp either.This set contains 6 Discs:Disc 1PilotThe Man Who Would Be KingA Day in the Life Of...Great ExpectationsDisc 2Voices of SilenceNancyDa DaThe Seating ChartDisc 3Moot CourtKingsfield's DaughterThe Sorcerer's ApprenticeBell and LoveDisc 4An Act of DesperationLosing StreakThe Man In The ChairA Matter of AngerDisc 5The ApprenticeOnce More With FeelingThe Clay Footed IdolDisc 6The Tables Down At Ernie'sThe Case of DetenteScavenger HuntConclusion - If you loved the movie ""The Paper Chase"", chances are you'll love this series.
