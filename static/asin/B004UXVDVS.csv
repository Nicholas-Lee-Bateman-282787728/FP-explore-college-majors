There's very little mention of the actual Lying Game mercifully because it sounds like Cruel Intentions type of demonstrations of teen cruelty.  But what IS interesting is that the childlike face of the lead actress playing both twins does NOT lend credence to there actually being a good poorer twin.  In fact, her ability to see the bright side in her new more comfortable situation may simply mean she is more adept at duplicitousness than her openly aggressive twin who may have learned from childhood disappointments that her adoptive parents are less innocent than their public demeanors.  There MUST be a reason Helen Slater is channeling Lindsay Wagner's unfortunate beige makeup instead of Mrs. Billy Moses' much cuter flintiness and focus.  We'll see.",4,The ONLY way to win at the Lying Game is to not play at all.,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,847,"['watched', 'marathon', 'ABC', 'Family', 'was', 'gist', 'entire', 'experience', 'very', 'little', 'mention', 'actual', 'Lying', 'Game', 'mercifully', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'type', 'demonstrations', 'teen', 'cruelty', 'what', 'IS', 'interesting', 'childlike', 'face', 'lead', 'actress', 'playing', 'twins', 'NOT', 'lend', 'credence', 'actually', 'being', 'good', 'poorer', 'twin', 'fact', 'ability', 'see', 'bright', 'side', 'new', 'more', 'comfortable', 'situation', 'may', 'simply', 'mean', 'more', 'adept', 'duplicitousness', 'openly', 'aggressive', 'twin', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'learned', 'childhood', 'disappointments', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'are', 'less', 'innocent', 'public', 'demeanors', 'MUST', 'be', 'reason', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'channeling', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'unfortunate', 'beige', 'makeup', 'instead', 'Mrs.', 'Billy', 'Moses', 'much', 'cuter', 'flintiness', 'focus', ""'ll"", 'see']",The Lying Game: Season 1

Then there is the cast.  Pros like Helen Slater and Adrian Pasdar.  Less not forget my favorite bare mid-drifted hottie from ""Angel"", Charisma Carpenter!Done in a serial format, this show keeps you wanting more!While the shows are different, ""The Lying Game"" reminds me of another guilty pleasure, ""Hell Cats"".  Attractive cast, kicking soundtrack and enough of a plot to keep you tuning in.  The difference being that ""The Lying Game"" will get a season 2!",4,Does Alexandra Draw 2-Salaries?

1429687,A3QI9X57XN5AR7,B004UXVDVS,L. Michael Gundy,"[0, 0]","There were two new series of TV shows last season about twins changing places, a common theme from long past. These shows were the Lying Game, for younger adults and teens, and ""Ringer"". Although both were entertaining, the Lying Game was the best in my opinion. In the Lying Game, the twins do not initially know each other exists because of adoption at birth. They both do not know each other or their birth parents, and begin to wonder when they become teenagers, because the parents do not tell them anything except that their birth mother is dead. Some plot twists in this show is that one twin was adopted by well-off parrents, twin Sutton, while the otheer ends up in the Los Vegas foster home system, Emma, and gos through 12 foster homes, prior to the series commencement.  Sutton starts to look for the twins real mother, but finds Emma first. The twins decide to switch places with Emma taking over Suttons's life, while Sutton continues to look for their birth mother. After the switch, the entertaining hyjinks begin.",4,twins-1,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,1030,"['were', 'two', 'new', 'series', 'TV', 'shows', 'last', 'season', 'twins', 'changing', 'places', 'common', 'theme', 'long', 'past', 'shows', 'were', 'Lying', 'Game', 'younger', 'adults', 'teens', 'Ringer', 'were', 'entertaining', 'Lying', 'Game', 'was', 'best', 'opinion', 'Lying', 'Game', 'twins', 'do', 'not', 'initially', 'know', 'other', 'exists', 'adoption', 'birth', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'other', 'birth', 'parents', 'begin', 'wonder', 'when', 'become', 'teenagers', 'parents', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'anything', 'birth', 'mother', 'dead', 'plot', 'twists', 'show', 'one', 'twin', 'was', 'adopted', 'well-off', 'parrents', 'Sutton', 'otheer', 'up', 'Los', 'Vegas', 'foster', 'home', 'system', 'Emma', 'gos', '12', 'foster', 'homes', 'prior', 'series', 'commencement', 'Sutton', 'look', 'twins', 'real', 'mother', 'Emma', 'first', 'twins', 'decide', 'switch', 'places', 'Emma', 'taking', 'over', 'Suttons', 'life', 'Sutton', 'look', 'birth', 'mother', 'switch', 'entertaining', 'hyjinks', 'begin']",The Lying Game: Season 1
