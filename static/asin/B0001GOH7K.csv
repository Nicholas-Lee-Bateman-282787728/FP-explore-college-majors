804868,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,B0001GOH7K,A Customer,"[1, 2]","A 2004 thriller that has a distinctly 90s look to it. It was deliberate, since that's the setting, and there's nothing wrong with choosing a 90s look. I did the same with VIGILANTE JUSTICE. They needed to ensure their hero wasn't too old to run, I wanted cynicism tinged with innocence, and both stories would be very different with cell phones and the Internet.Michael Caine plays a Frenchman who cooperated with the Vichy Government during WWII and killed some Jews, and he's running from that over 40 years later. This feels like a made-for-TV movie. It's a fairly straightforward thriller with gorgeous French scenery and a forgivable number of cliches, elevated just a tad by Caine's fine performance. If it's on your TV, tape it. If you find it in a DVD shop in China, go ahead and grab it. It's good for when you're feeling exhausted. The novel may be different, but I tend to doubt it.",4,The Statement,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,893,"['2004', 'thriller', 'distinctly', '90s', 'look', 'was', 'deliberate', 'setting', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'choosing', '90s', 'look', 'did', 'same', 'VIGILANTE', 'JUSTICE', 'needed', 'ensure', 'hero', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'old', 'run', 'wanted', 'cynicism', 'tinged', 'innocence', 'stories', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'cell', 'phones', 'Internet.Michael', 'Caine', 'Frenchman', 'who', 'cooperated', 'Vichy', 'Government', 'WWII', 'killed', 'Jews', 'running', '40', 'years', 'later', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'thriller', 'gorgeous', 'French', 'scenery', 'forgivable', 'number', 'cliches', 'elevated', 'just', 'tad', 'Caine', 'fine', 'performance', 'TV', 'tape', 'find', 'DVD', 'shop', 'China', 'go', 'ahead', 'grab', 'good', 'when', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'exhausted', 'novel', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'tend', 'doubt']",The Statement
804869,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0001GOH7K,Alex Udvary,"[2, 2]","When dealing with a movie like ""The Statement"" it's important that somehow we find ourselves feeling empathy for the lead character despite whatever his flaws may be. This makes the movie much more passionate and personal. Now we are caught in a conflict. We see this terrible person, but yet, somehow, we feel sorry for him.For the most part Michael Caine does this in the film adaption of Brian Moore's novel about a Nazi spy who was been on the run for 40 years and now time has caught up with him as his days seem to be numbered due to an investigation being led by Annemarie Levi (Tilda Swinton).If I made this film I would have changed a lot about this movie. Granted I have not read the novel by Moore nor was I was familiar with these facts but I think a movie like this would have been better if it focused more on Caine life and offered more flashbacks. If we would see Caine reflecting on the past being haunted by his past. We do see these moments in the film, but not enough of them.The way ""The Statement"" was made was into a political thriller. Therefore we have more of a cop routine picture. Swinton and her partner Jeremy Notham do the chase scenes and the undercover work, and we may even sense a romance. These two characters are given just as much screentime as Caine, and that I feel is a mistake.Even though I say these things that does not mean I didn't appreciate this film, because I did. The acting from the cast is enjoyable to watch and keep your attention. Director Norman Jewison strings things together nicely. We are never bored with the movie. And the movie, even though I may not like the approach that was taken, is well written. The script is by Ronald Harwood who wrote ""The Pianist"".As I watched this movie I thought of a film made a while ago entitled ""The Music Box"". It starred Jessica Lang. It dealt with a similar idea but here ""The Statement"" approves upon it.Not a lot of people are going to see this movie. Not because it's a bad movie, it's not a bad movie at all, but people simply haven't heard of it. I remember when it came out it played in only one threatre here and I didn't even know when the release date was for vhs or dvd. This is unfortunate. This is really a well made well acted film that deserve a first chance.Bottom-line: Well made movie with some fince acting headed by Michael Caine. Has some strong moments and keeps you involved.

804870,A2SHF3F8N7HGS3,B0001GOH7K,"Allen Eaton ""aleaton3""","[1, 1]","I rented this DVD solely because of Michael Caine and wasn't disappointed in his performance.  I agree with other reviewers that the plot is unreeled slowly and certain key points (the motaives of the conspirators, and the motives of the Roman Catholic Church) are undeveloped and remain cloudy.My chief disappointment was with the ending.  Brossard, the French traitor, is finally gunned down by the government assassins who suceed in placing their STATEMENT on the body.  The statement says that Brossard was executed for his war crimes, but then further condemns the Catholic Church for protecting Brossard for nearly 50 years.  Is this condemnation the true meaning of the story?Directly after this scene, in which Tilda Swinton's character of a French judge arrives too late to take Brossard into custody, the film cuts to a ball-room scene.  The judge goes up to several highly-placed French officials and subtly informs them that their time is up, and that justice is coming for them.  The implication is that the actual assassin (a member of the French police) has been arrested and is naming names.  However, we do not see that scene, only the vague reference (just one line) made by the lady judge.  (That polieman, in my opinion, would never have named names because he is dedicated to what he believes is a just cause.)  Thus the film reminded me of one of those crime dramas of the '30s, where the outcome must always be the same, even if it defies reason:  G-Men always get their man and that &quot;crime doesn't pay.&quot;Since the screenplay does not go deeply into the nature of the conspiracy of the French ministers, and we never learn their names, their titles or positions, but instead focuses on Brossard's quest to &quot;die in a state of grace and forgiveness&quot; the film suffers from a split personaility.  In the end, the audience is left in the middle.  The filmmakers do not finish either story but instead make a statement of their own: that we should not forget the memories of those slaughtered by a reprehensible regime.It struck me that Brossard actually paid for his crimes when he was shot dead.  Did it really matter who did the shooting?  If the judge had caught him, he would have been put on trial and sent to prison for the rest of his life (probably a very short time as he was already quite old and suffering from heart disease).  Since the entent and purpose of the &quot;official&quot; conspiracy wasn't dealt with in detail, I would have preferred the more ambiguous ending of seeing Brossard gunned down and his assassin successfully escaping into the night.  This is a more perfect ending since Brossard kisses a religious icon just before dying, thus believing that he really did die &quot;in a state of grace and forgiveness.&quot;  I like ambiguity, and in this case, it works perfectly.I am not familiar with the novel.  Should I be?  When I see a film, it's story should be enough.  I realize that liberties are taken in translating books to screenplays, but either version  should stay true to it's theme.  But you have to have a theme in the first place.  If the theme in this film was to make a statement that we remember the Jews who were betrayed and killed, (but at the same time provide some sense that &quot;justice was done&quot;) then the final scene should have been supported by a previous scene in which the policeman responsible made some sort of statement of his own.  That, of course, would have meant that the conspiracy story should have been further developed.  Otherwise the ending is self-serving and the dramatic structure is betrayed.",4,Justice Done,1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,3612,"['rented', 'DVD', 'solely', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'performance', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'plot', 'unreeled', 'slowly', 'certain', 'key', 'points', 'motaives', 'conspirators', 'motives', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'are', 'undeveloped', 'remain', 'cloudy.My', 'chief', 'disappointment', 'was', 'ending', 'Brossard', 'French', 'traitor', 'finally', 'gunned', 'down', 'government', 'assassins', 'who', 'suceed', 'placing', 'STATEMENT', 'body', 'statement', 'Brossard', 'was', 'executed', 'war', 'crimes', 'then', 'further', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'protecting', 'Brossard', 'nearly', '50', 'years', 'condemnation', 'true', 'meaning', 'story', 'Directly', 'scene', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'character', 'French', 'judge', 'too', 'late', 'take', 'Brossard', 'custody', 'film', 'cuts', 'ball-room', 'scene', 'judge', 'up', 'several', 'highly-placed', 'French', 'officials', 'subtly', 'informs', 'time', 'up', 'justice', 'coming', 'implication', 'actual', 'assassin', 'member', 'French', 'police', 'been', 'arrested', 'naming', 'names', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'scene', 'only', 'vague', 'reference', 'just', 'one', 'line', 'made', 'lady', 'judge', 'polieman', 'opinion', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'named', 'names', 'dedicated', 'what', 'just', 'cause', 'Thus', 'film', 'reminded', 'one', 'crime', 'dramas', ""'30s"", 'where', 'outcome', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'same', 'even', 'reason', 'G-Men', 'always', 'get', 'man', 'quot', 'crime', ""n't"", 'pay.', 'quot', 'screenplay', 'not', 'go', 'deeply', 'nature', 'conspiracy', 'French', 'ministers', 'never', 'learn', 'names', 'titles', 'positions', 'instead', 'focuses', 'Brossard', 'quest', 'quot', 'die', 'state', 'grace', 'forgiveness', 'quot', 'film', 'suffers', 'split', 'personaility', 'end', 'audience', 'left', 'middle', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'not', 'finish', 'either', 'story', 'instead', 'make', 'statement', 'own', 'should', 'not', 'forget', 'memories', 'slaughtered', 'reprehensible', 'regime.It', 'struck', 'Brossard', 'actually', 'paid', 'crimes', 'when', 'was', 'shot', 'dead', 'Did', 'really', 'matter', 'who', 'did', 'shooting', 'judge', 'had', 'caught', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'trial', 'sent', 'prison', 'rest', 'life', 'probably', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'was', 'already', 'quite', 'old', 'suffering', 'heart', 'disease', 'entent', 'purpose', 'quot', 'official', 'quot', 'conspiracy', 'was', ""n't"", 'dealt', 'detail', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'seeing', 'Brossard', 'gunned', 'down', 'assassin', 'successfully', 'escaping', 'night', 'more', 'perfect', 'ending', 'Brossard', 'religious', 'icon', 'just', 'dying', 'thus', 'believing', 'really', 'did', 'die', 'quot', 'state', 'grace', 'forgiveness.', 'quot', 'like', 'ambiguity', 'case', 'perfectly.I', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'novel', 'Should', 'be', 'When', 'see', 'film', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'realize', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'translating', 'books', 'screenplays', 'version', 'should', 'stay', 'true', 'theme', 'have', 'have', 'theme', 'first', 'place', 'theme', 'film', 'was', 'make', 'statement', 'remember', 'Jews', 'who', 'were', 'betrayed', 'killed', 'same', 'time', 'provide', 'sense', 'quot', 'justice', 'was', 'done', 'quot', 'then', 'final', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'supported', 'previous', 'scene', 'policeman', 'responsible', 'made', 'sort', 'statement', 'own', 'course', 'would', 'have', 'meant', 'conspiracy', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'further', 'developed', 'Otherwise', 'ending', 'self-serving', 'dramatic', 'structure', 'betrayed']",The Statement

We follow an elderly Frenchman and former Nazi-sympathizer during WWII, finding himself the subject of a new investigation as it transpires that the Catholic Church and members of the government helped to hide him for more than 50 years, for his role in the death of Jews during WWII. The director cleverly tries to use the framework of this investigative thriller to mirror more contemporary political and moral issues but this all gets a little lost however, in the complex morass of Wartime France, Nazi's, and the Catholic Church. I think that mainstream American audiences may lack the curiosity, or historical understanding to take an interest in a political thriller that delves into so ""foreign"" a topic.

Unfortunately, however, Caine's welcome presence isn't nearly enough to save this very bad movie.  Norman Jewison's directing is nothing short of inept.  Worst of all, though, is the pretentious, bloated, and preposterous plot, shot through with tiresome self-righteousness, as well as hackneyed and sledgehammer anti-Catholicism.Without a scintilla of self-awareness or irony, ""The Statement"" is earnestly dedicated to the Nazis' French-Jewish victims.

804873,A1URPQ4S8TJCR4,B0001GOH7K,Bert vanC Bailey,"[1, 1]","Another fine Norman Jewison film, this Canada-UK co-production is a gem of a thriller where Michael Caine gets to show his considerable skills as he'd seldom done since 'The Ipcress File' and 'Get Carter.' This is one of the high points in a career that was also marred by a lot of dreck (by his own admission, the money was always tempting; sometimes too much so).Amazing that an aging man was given the lead in an essentially suspenseful plot - in fact, a thriller. The main character has great complexity, on the lam yet pious as they come: killing one minute, asking that others pray for him the next. Outside of Brian Moore's novel, you might feel this complexity is a bit of a stretch, but who better than Caine to try to pull it off? And who knew that Moore ('Catholics,' 'The Luck of Ginger Coffey') could pen such a thriller, and be so clear-eyed about one of the RC church's more recent areas of criminality?!The screenplay is by Ronald Harwood, who also took on Polanski's 'The Pianist' and 'Oliver Twist,' Julian Schnabel's 'The diving bell and the butterfly,' and the screenplay for 'Love in the Time of Cholera.' Many fine actors seem to have lined up for a part in this sharply-plotted caper, which is overspilling with top-flight talent. Sub-leads include Tilda Swinton and a clearly underutilized Jeremy Northam (who's badly served even by the costumes department).Minor supporting roles feature Alan Bates, Charlotte Rampling, William Hutt and John Neville. Rampling's part is all but microscopic, and only Bates is reasonably well utilized. But why grumble: it's a stellar cast rounding out a fine plot, Jewison's straight-shooting direction, and all in dreamy settings ('though the France that's depicted is high-rise free, and every setting seems urged by their tourist board).Despite these little niggles, this flick's a winner.",5,Sharply-plotted Jewison-Caine-Harwood caper,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,1850,"['fine', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'film', 'Canada-UK', 'co-production', 'gem', 'thriller', 'where', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'show', 'considerable', 'skills', ""'d"", 'seldom', 'done', ""'The"", 'Ipcress', 'File', 'Carter', 'one', 'high', 'points', 'career', 'was', 'also', 'marred', 'lot', 'dreck', 'own', 'admission', 'money', 'was', 'always', 'tempting', 'sometimes', 'too', 'much', '.Amazing', 'aging', 'man', 'was', 'given', 'lead', 'essentially', 'suspenseful', 'plot', 'fact', 'thriller', 'main', 'character', 'great', 'complexity', 'lam', 'yet', 'pious', 'come', 'killing', 'one', 'minute', 'asking', 'others', 'pray', 'next', 'Brian', 'Moore', 'novel', 'might', 'feel', 'complexity', 'bit', 'stretch', 'who', 'better', 'Caine', 'try', 'pull', 'off', 'who', 'knew', 'Moore', ""'Catholics"", 'Luck', 'Ginger', 'Coffey', 'could', 'pen', 'thriller', 'be', 'so', 'clear-eyed', 'one', 'RC', 'church', 'more', 'recent', 'areas', 'criminality', 'screenplay', 'Ronald', 'Harwood', 'who', 'also', 'took', 'Polanski', ""'The"", 'Pianist', 'Twist', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', ""'The"", 'diving', 'bell', 'butterfly', 'screenplay', ""'Love"", 'Time', 'Cholera', 'Many', 'fine', 'actors', 'seem', 'have', 'lined', 'up', 'part', 'sharply-plotted', 'caper', 'overspilling', 'top-flight', 'talent', 'Sub-leads', 'include', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'clearly', 'underutilized', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'who', 'badly', 'served', 'even', 'costumes', 'department', 'supporting', 'roles', 'feature', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'William', 'Hutt', 'John', 'Neville', 'Rampling', 'part', 'microscopic', 'only', 'Bates', 'reasonably', 'well', 'utilized', 'why', 'grumble', 'stellar', 'cast', 'rounding', 'out', 'fine', 'plot', 'Jewison', 'straight-shooting', 'direction', 'dreamy', 'settings', 'France', 'depicted', 'high-rise', 'free', 'setting', 'urged', 'tourist', 'board', 'little', 'niggles', 'flick', 'winner']",The Statement

The story has well fleshed-out major characters, and the unrelenting mystery and suspense should hold the attention of most moviegoers.  It's unfortunate that the film constitutes still another screed against the Catholic Church, which is portrayed as a sinister organization that pulls out all the stops not just to protect, but even to coddle, a fugitive who has lived off Rome's largesse for decades.  Priests and monks scurry to meet his every need and defy the Vatican when told to stop.  Because the Church hates Communism, the movie purports, and Jews, the movie hints, the Catholic hierarchy gleefully embraces anyone who aided the Nazis.  There is no mention of Catholics who hid Jews or abetted their escapes, not even those officials who made devil's deals to save groups of them.  As in so many modern films, any entity that opposes a left-wing agenda must be demonized and discredited.  (It seems a wonder the audience isn't treated to a scene with a priest leering at a little boy).  What the viewer does get is the requisite agnostic protagonist, a gratuitous flash of a bare male butt, and the notion that the French nobility is still too powerful.

He has to excape both investigators and assassins (possibly from a radical Jewish organization) by taking refuge in primarily catholic churches.It was actually filmed in France in real churches and government buildings. Excellent Hitchcockian cinematography and music. Well paced editing and outstanding acting from Tilda Swinton, Jeremy Northam, Ciaran Hinds, Frank Finlay, Alan Bates...and especially Caine. The screenplay was expertly adapted by Ron Harwood. And, for a film with a pretty low budget, the DVD transfer (anamorphic) is excellent and the 5.1 surround sound is decent.What's up with the critics? OK, I'm a big Michael Caine fan, but that doesn't mean I like ALL the films he's in (Secondhand Lions was kinda corny, his role in Goldmember was far too small, etc.). This role is a true showcase for him. And anyone who respects Caine as an actor should watch this movie.In truth, the storyline may be hard to follow...I'm sure that's the primary problem for the critics. I had the advantage of reading the original novel first, so there was virtually no confusion for me...and the film is remarkably faithful to the novel!The novel was a bit complicated at times and I found myself having to re-read the occasional passage to keep up with the story...so maybe the film is similar in that respect.Also, a lot of critics had a problem with the fact that the English actors aren't speaking with French accents...but this has been the case with many films before (Quills, The Last Emperor, Three Musketeers), I don't know why this film should be any different...besides, I can't think of anything more distracting than listening to a bunch of actors speaking with phony French accents for 2 hours!I say take a chance on the film. It's definitely a thinking-person's thriller.

804879,ACBFF25XJC2T7,B0001GOH7K,Choice Critic,"[6, 12]","Three years before ""The Da Vinci Code"" made Opus Dei into a vast Catholic conspiracy, Norman Jewison directed ""The Statement"" in 2003.  It makes Opus Dei seem like a polo club, merely hiding the equivalent of a secret handshake.  Not only does the French Catholic Church have its own secret society (""Chevaliers""), this group has been sheltering a French war criminal (Michael Caine) within various abbeys throughout France for sixty years after the war. He is being pursued by the French police under a new human rights law, and by some unknown, woefully incompetent, assassins.Caine's war crime, in the service of Vichy France, is based upon the actual murder of seven innocent Jews on June 29,1944 by the Nazis in the French town of Rilleux-la-pape, in which he collaborated as a young officer. Caine's acting is superb as usual.  He plays the sorrowful, guilt-ridden penitent as well as any of the self-confident, worldly-wise roles he normally plays; the mark of a great actor.  Tilda Swinton as the judge and Jeremy Northam as the detective in pursuit of Caine do serviceable work but never provide the sexual chemistry intended.Of course, the French Catholic secret society that has been hiding Caine reaches to the highest ranks of power in postwar France. There is also the ""de rigueur"" call to the Vatican to an unnamed Vatican official.  Though the Vatican refuses to help Caine escape from France, the dialogue carries the obvious implication that though it has helped in the past it just can't do it anymore; not necessarly because it is immoral, but, you know, bad pub.Immediately prior to the final credits, the film is pretextually dedicated to the seven innocents murdered at the beginning of the film; along with the approximately 77,000 other Jews murdered during that period.Jewison, however, seems not as interested in dedicating his story to murdered French Jews as he is in doing a number on the Catholic Church.Keep in mind that the murder of innocent Jews by Nazis, with French collaboration, is the only factual part of the entire movie. The rest is a shameless calumny of the Catholic Church, bereft of fact and well beyond the boundaries of artistic license.This movie leaps from the undoubted fact of a Catholic clergy passively turning their heads the other way during the Nazi persecution of the Jews, to the active complicity of the church in sheltering war criminals during the postwar period. There is absolutely no evidence to support such a gross distortion of history. The Rev. John Hagee in San Antonio might enjoy the message in this movie. I did not.Never forget, but never distort.

Based on a true story, Pierre Brossard (Michael Caine in a finely nuanced tragic performance) worked with the Vichy regime during the Nazi occupation of France and was responsible for the murders of seven Jews in 1944.  It is now 1992 and Brossard has been in hiding under the cover and support of the Chevaliers, a band of men connected with the Catholic Church. Politically he has been pardoned, but there are those who wish him dead.  A new French Judge (Tilda Swinton in another fine performance) and military Colonel Roux (Jeremy Northam) join forces (somewhat unwillingly) and commit themselves to ferreting out Brossard.  Their efforts are parallel to the forces who plot to assassinate Brossard and it is this bipolar cat-and-mouse intrigue that chases Brossard from Abbey to Abbey throughout France.  The ending comes as somewhat of a surprise, but the chase makes it all worth the wait.

804883,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0001GOH7K,Joseph Haschka,"[12, 13]","Although his films aren't always artistic successes, Michael Caine is one of my favorite actors, and at his best when his character is cheekily likable, e.g. in THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING (1975), SLEUTH (1972), SECONDHAND LIONS (2003). Rarely, he plays someone hateful, the most recent coming to mind being SHINER (2000). Here, in THE STATEMENT, his on-screen persona is oddly ambiguous, and it's left to supporting characters to provide the plot's protagonists.It's June 1942, and a young Vichy French police officer, Pierre Brossard, supervises the round-up and execution of seven Jews by a contingent of German soldiers. After the war, he's charged with murder and collaboration with the enemy, but he escapes from prison, apparently aided by former superiors in the police establishment. Now, it's 1992, and Brossard (Michael Caine) lives in constant fear of exposure. A fervent Catholic, he skulks from French monastery to monastery, wherein he finds refuge with the help of sympathetic abbots and Church officials. A retired, former police official provides regular payments of money for frugal, day-to-day living. Now, Brossard is apparently being pursued by Jewish activists bent on his assassination. And if he hasn't worries enough, the French Justice Ministry has assigned a judge, Annemarie Livi (Tilda Swinton), and a police investigator, Colonel Roux (Jeremy Northam), to track Pierre down and take him into custody charged with war crimes. Are the two events related?Pierre's wartime atrocity and his cold-hearted willingness to protect himself at any cost in the present are unlikely to endear him to the audience. On the other hand, the nature of the conspiracy against him by sinister forces, his failing health, and his sincere, if somewhat pathetic, religiousness render him an individual of some ambiguity. In the end, while Livi and Roux are the characters the viewer will naturally root for, Brossard will attract some small amount of sympathy because, perhaps, it's the popular Michael Caine in the role.For me, the biggest problem with this otherwise reasonably intelligent film is the casting. Caine's Cockney British accent is never entirely submerged, and the other main roles have gone to Brits, most obviously Northam and Swinton. This is, after all, supposed to be France, but it might as well have been rural Hampshire! And it's never made clear why both the Church and powerful members of the government found it necessary or desirable to protect such a low-level Vichy functionary for so long anyway.

The movie has a truly intriguing premise, with Caine portraying a Nazi collaborator being hunted some 50 years after his crimes.  The movie starts with a bang, quite literally, as Caine kills his would-be assassin and escapes.But beyond that, the movie goes nowhere and the pacing is slow.  Poor pacing is a forgiveable offense if the drama and characterization is there, but this movie has neither.  Tilda Swinton and Jeremy Northam both sleepwalk through roles that lack depth.  For all the accolades that Caine has received lately, they are least deserving for his performance here.  His character is similarly one-dimensional and lacking nuance or a wide array of anything.  In short, his character is only about self-preservation.  Just because he has conflicts with God does not make him any less self-serving.As for the plot itself, it does not unravel itself well, even by the end of the film.  Characters that are central to the conspiracy portrayed in the film are given little screen time and even less explanation.  One understands that there is a conspiracy and who the conspirators are, but does not come away with a clear grasp of their motives.In the end, the film's biggest asset is its exposure (to this viewer, at least) of the Nazi's ""final solution"" as applied in France, particularly under the Vichy regime.

It opens with a chilling scene filmed in black and white of seven Jews being dragged from their homes and brutally murdered.  Flash forward to 1992.  The audience sees a ""statement"" being typed identifying this wanted man.  It's supposed to be placed upon his body after he is murdered.  But Michael Caine turns the tables on his stalker and murders the man who is after him.During the rest of the film, Caine is the hunted, but it is unclear who, exactly is after him.  Is it the relatives of the Jews he murdered?  Is it the corrupt French police?  Is the Church?  Or  it a person in a high position who is concerned about his political future?  Anyway, Caine is on the run.  And Tilda Swinton cast as a judge, is trying to find him before he is murdered.  The story is confusing.  But the emotion is there.  And Michael Caine, now 70 years old, does an incredible acting job.  It's a difficult role, but he puts life into this unreformed but repentant Frenchman who keeps seeking absolution from priests as he goes about evading killers and doing some killing of his own.  He is not a likeable character, but he's very human.One of the problems I had with the film was that even though it was about a Frenchman and takes place in France, everyone speaks English.  But I guess the filmmaker had to make some sort of compromise in order to get Caine.  There was one excellent scene between Caine and his ex-wife, played by Charlotte Rampling.  Problem is that it wasn't fully developed enough.

Jewison (see special features), I can tell that shooting this movie in french would have been very difficult. Although there are a few hints about in the film, nobody is really aware (part of the few who are dont want to be reminded, and worse, the other part don't want to be exposed) that the main change in 1945 was to add communists (one of the worst indignities being that Maurice Thorez, upon Staline's earnest recommendation, got his death sentence commuted in a position as a minister in the governement by de Gaulle himself...) to the Vichy dignitaries who escaped the fate they deserved. And, although it is briefly mentionned, the communists only entered Resistance after Hitler and Staline parted; their only aim was to be his position to deliver France into Staline hands, and maybe their greatest achievement was to perform terrorist attacks when and where they were certain that reprisals victims would be those who didn't share their communist vision: so they could be seen as patriots while getting rid of their opponents.One other reason for the leniency towards french police (a good one in the short term, but a most poisonous one in the long term), was that nobody wanted to alienate in any way the only organisation thought able (?) to take care of riots and miscellaneous disorders following the 'Liberation'; and, since they were in charge of preventing witch-hunts, it would have been very difficult to make them understand they should have been investigated as well.One should not forget, for a better understanding of the story background, that after Pie XI (pro-fascit to the core, altough opposed to racism) died in 1939, Pie XII (who was convinced that Hitler represented the last defence against communism) never condemned nazism, and even gave (through his bishops) his blessing to german armies. But, since the Roman Catholic Church was the first one to practice large-scale genocides (remember South America and the Conquistadores' mudering and pillaging in the name of God, which is the proof that the so-called ""no prescription for crimes against humanity"" should be better understood), maybe he felt some sort of kindred sympathy...",5,Please nobody complains...,1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,2300,"['English', 'cast', 'karma', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'have', 'born', 'France', 'aside', 'good', 'reasons', 'given', 'N.', 'Jewison', 'see', 'special', 'features', 'can', 'tell', 'shooting', 'movie', 'french', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'difficult', 'are', 'few', 'hints', 'film', 'nobody', 'really', 'aware', 'part', 'few', 'who', 'are', 'dont', 'want', 'be', 'reminded', 'worse', 'other', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'exposed', 'main', 'change', '1945', 'was', 'add', 'communists', 'one', 'worst', 'indignities', 'being', 'Maurice', 'Thorez', 'Staline', 'earnest', 'recommendation', 'got', 'death', 'sentence', 'commuted', 'position', 'minister', 'governement', 'de', 'Gaulle', 'Vichy', 'dignitaries', 'who', 'escaped', 'fate', 'deserved', 'briefly', 'mentionned', 'communists', 'only', 'entered', 'Resistance', 'Hitler', 'Staline', 'parted', 'only', 'aim', 'was', 'be', 'position', 'deliver', 'France', 'Staline', 'hands', 'maybe', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'was', 'perform', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'when', 'where', 'were', 'certain', 'reprisals', 'victims', 'would', 'be', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'share', 'communist', 'vision', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'patriots', 'getting', 'rid', 'opponents.One', 'other', 'reason', 'leniency', 'towards', 'french', 'police', 'good', 'one', 'short', 'term', 'most', 'poisonous', 'one', 'long', 'term', 'was', 'nobody', 'wanted', 'alienate', 'way', 'only', 'organisation', 'thought', 'able', 'take', 'care', 'riots', 'miscellaneous', 'disorders', 'following', ""'Liberation"", 'were', 'charge', 'preventing', 'witch-hunts', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'difficult', 'make', 'understand', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'investigated', 'well.One', 'should', 'not', 'forget', 'better', 'understanding', 'story', 'background', 'Pie', 'XI', 'pro-fascit', 'core', 'opposed', 'racism', 'died', '1939', 'Pie', 'XII', 'who', 'was', 'convinced', 'Hitler', 'represented', 'last', 'defence', 'communism', 'never', 'condemned', 'nazism', 'even', 'gave', 'bishops', 'blessing', 'german', 'armies', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'practice', 'large-scale', 'genocides', 'remember', 'South', 'America', 'Conquistadores', 'mudering', 'pillaging', 'name', 'God', 'proof', 'so-called', 'prescription', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'should', 'be', 'better', 'understood', 'maybe', 'felt', 'sort', 'kindred', 'sympathy']",The Statement

And while that tends to be true of Brian Moore adaptations, he does tend to get at least decent movies made of his novels (and every once in a while a true winner, like Black Robe); this one certainly qualifies as decent.Michael Caine stars as Pierre Brossard, a former Vichy operative accused of killing seven Jews in 1944. He has been in hiding for the past forty years, but now two groups are after him-- one that wants him dead, and one that wants to keep him alive and pump him for information on the network that's been hiding him. The former group are operating outside the law; the latter are the law, headed up by Judge Anne-Marie Livi (Constantine's Tilda Swinton).The action comes fast and furious, and Caine turns in a good, if not great, performance, with a competent supporting cast.

804894,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001GOH7K,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 9]","**1/2 In Norman Jewison's tepid thriller, ""The Statement,"" English-accented Michael Caine plays Pierre Brossard, an aging French war criminal whose past has begun to catch up with him.  In 1944, Brossard, a member of the infamous Vichy regime, not only collaborated with the Nazis, but was personally responsible for the cold-blooded execution of 14 unarmed Jewish Frenchmen as well.  Immediately after the war, Brossard was tried and convicted for these offenses, but somehow managed to escape before he could face his deserved punishment.  In the years since, Brossard has lived his life underground, finding protection and sanctuary from a branch of the Roman Catholic Church sympathetic to his cause.  And although the French authorities have been unsuccessful in their attempts to locate him, Brossard has recently found himself the target of a mysterious group of assassins, possibly members of a secret Jewish organization seeking justice for his yet unavenged crimes against humanity.The idea of a Nazi war criminal still living in hiding all these years after the end of World War II has the makings of an interesting movie, no doubt, but ""The Statement"" is not that movie.  To the filmmakers' credit, they do at least attempt to present Brossard as a three-dimensional character, a man who, decades after his horrendous crimes, is still seeking redemption through his pious devotion to the Church.  Caine, in a deftly balanced performance, manages to make Brossard almost sympathetic while still allowing us to see the ""monster"" hidden beneath the ravaged soul.  Unfortunately, the actor is let down by a screenplay that seems more concerned with tired cloak-and-dagger espionage routines than with a serious study of a fascinating and conflicted character.  Even more annoying is the attempt on the part of the film to paint the entire Catholic Church hierarchy as a bunch of diabolical, self-serving individuals who are busy either protecting one of their own at any or all costs or acting out of political expediency rather than true moral conviction.  Fans of ""The Da Vinci Code"" may swallow this anti-Catholic paranoia without question, but the rest of us can merely wonder why the Church hasn't been able to cop a break from the movies since Father Damien kicked the be-Jesus out of the devil in ""The Exorcist,"" thirty long years ago.  I'm certainly no apologist for the Catholic Church (see my review of ""The Magdalene Sisters""), but even we non-believers can wonder when we will be seeing a little more evenhandedness and balance in the movies' portrayal of the Church.  Certainly there must be SOME well-meaning priest, nun or bishop out there that some filmmaker might consider as worthwhile movie material.There are other problems with the film as well.  Tilda Swinton, as an impassioned judge searching for Brossard, and Jeremy Northam, as a more pragmatic policeman who reluctantly joins her in her pursuit, make an annoying, constantly bickering couple who look, for all the world, like a minor-league Mulder and Scully, minus the attraction and charm.  Alan Bates and Charlotte Rampling (reunited from ""Georgy Girl,"" though the two actors never appear in the same scene together) are wasted in minor roles.  And Jewison, who was once so fine a young director, fails to bring any of the scenes in this film to life.  One also questions the propriety of taking a serious subject like Nazi atrocities and using it as little more than cheap window dressing for an undistinguished, run-of-the-mill thriller.""The Statement,"" despite another fine performance from the ever-reliable Michael Caine, is a tired, lackluster and cynical exercise, strangely devoid of meaning, conviction and purpose.",2,a truly bland thriller,1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,3712,"['**1/2', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'tepid', 'thriller', 'Statement', 'English-accented', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Pierre', 'Brossard', 'aging', 'French', 'war', 'criminal', 'past', 'begun', 'catch', 'up', '1944', 'Brossard', 'member', 'infamous', 'Vichy', 'regime', 'not', 'only', 'collaborated', 'Nazis', 'was', 'personally', 'responsible', 'cold-blooded', 'execution', '14', 'unarmed', 'Jewish', 'Frenchmen', 'as', 'well', 'Immediately', 'war', 'Brossard', 'was', 'tried', 'convicted', 'offenses', 'somehow', 'managed', 'escape', 'could', 'face', 'deserved', 'punishment', 'years', 'Brossard', 'lived', 'life', 'underground', 'finding', 'protection', 'sanctuary', 'branch', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'sympathetic', 'cause', 'French', 'authorities', 'have', 'been', 'unsuccessful', 'attempts', 'locate', 'Brossard', 'recently', 'found', 'target', 'mysterious', 'group', 'assassins', 'possibly', 'members', 'secret', 'Jewish', 'organization', 'seeking', 'justice', 'yet', 'unavenged', 'crimes', 'humanity.The', 'idea', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'still', 'living', 'hiding', 'years', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'makings', 'interesting', 'movie', 'doubt', 'Statement', 'not', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'credit', 'do', 'least', 'attempt', 'present', 'Brossard', 'three-dimensional', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'decades', 'horrendous', 'crimes', 'still', 'seeking', 'redemption', 'pious', 'devotion', 'Church', 'Caine', 'deftly', 'balanced', 'performance', 'make', 'Brossard', 'almost', 'sympathetic', 'still', 'allowing', 'see', 'monster', 'hidden', 'ravaged', 'soul', 'Unfortunately', 'actor', 'let', 'down', 'screenplay', 'more', 'concerned', 'tired', 'cloak-and-dagger', 'espionage', 'routines', 'serious', 'study', 'fascinating', 'conflicted', 'character', 'Even', 'more', 'annoying', 'attempt', 'part', 'film', 'paint', 'entire', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'hierarchy', 'bunch', 'diabolical', 'self-serving', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'busy', 'protecting', 'one', 'own', 'costs', 'acting', 'political', 'expediency', 'rather', 'true', 'moral', 'conviction', 'Fans', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'may', 'swallow', 'anti-Catholic', 'paranoia', 'question', 'rest', 'can', 'merely', 'wonder', 'why', 'Church', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'cop', 'break', 'movies', 'Father', 'Damien', 'kicked', 'be-Jesus', 'devil', 'Exorcist', 'thirty', 'long', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'apologist', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'see', 'review', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'even', 'non-believers', 'can', 'wonder', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'little', 'more', 'evenhandedness', 'balance', 'movies', 'portrayal', 'Church', 'Certainly', 'must', 'be', 'SOME', 'well-meaning', 'priest', 'bishop', 'out', 'there', 'filmmaker', 'might', 'consider', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'are', 'other', 'problems', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'impassioned', 'judge', 'searching', 'Brossard', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'more', 'pragmatic', 'policeman', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'pursuit', 'make', 'annoying', 'constantly', 'bickering', 'couple', 'who', 'look', 'world', 'minor-league', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'minus', 'attraction', 'charm', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'reunited', 'Georgy', 'Girl', 'two', 'actors', 'never', 'appear', 'same', 'scene', 'together', 'are', 'wasted', 'minor', 'roles', 'Jewison', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'so', 'fine', 'young', 'director', 'bring', 'scenes', 'film', 'life', 'One', 'also', 'questions', 'propriety', 'taking', 'serious', 'subject', 'Nazi', 'atrocities', 'using', 'little', 'more', 'cheap', 'window', 'dressing', 'undistinguished', 'run-of-the-mill', 'thriller', 'Statement', 'fine', 'performance', 'ever-reliable', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'tired', 'lackluster', 'cynical', 'exercise', 'strangely', 'devoid', 'meaning', 'conviction', 'purpose']",The Statement

It's a political thriller/crime drama, an independent production, apparently put together by Canadian/French/British studios -I see mention made of the CBC and the BBC-- , and it cost $23 million to make.  Yet, despite a plethora of talent before and behind the cameras, including its Oscar-winning star Michael Caine, it lost $22 million.  An odd case, that.  Still, I found it an interesting film.It was made onsite, in France, and gives us lots of beautiful French Riviera scenery.  In addition, someone connected with the film's art department has given us some ravishingly lovely art nouveau set dressing; all the bars look so beautiful you'd gladly live in them, and there's an old-fashioned glass elevator door that's just heart stopping.  Another oddity of the film: despite the fact that it is set in France, and tells a story set in France, it was made with an entirely British cast, who do not attempt those funny ""continental"" accents; on one of the disk's extras, its director says he believes British actors can play continental particularly well, and he doesn't think those accents are really appropriate: the French speaking French in their own country don't speak with accents.During World War II, Frenchman Pierre Brossard, who collaborated happily with his country's Nazi occupiers and the Vichy government they created, murdered 14 Jews. Many years later, in the early 1990's, it's his turn to be the prey again, as he was after war's end, when a new law punishing `crimes against humanity,' is passed.  A Nazi hunter, the police and hired killers pick up his trail.  The Oscar-winning Caine, the world's favorite cockney actor - some might think him an odd casting choice for this role--plays the protagonist Brossard.  Caine, who took home Hollywood's favorite statuette forHannah and Her Sisters, andThe Dark Knight Trilogy (Batman Begins / The Dark Knight / The Dark Knight Rises) [Blu-ray], was, he says in the disk's extras, after a low period in his career,  in the midst of a great  career revival.  Odd casting or not, he gives another brilliant performance, pretty much carrying the picture. His character is a many-faceted one- a pious, religious man, devout Catholic and cold-blooded Nazi war criminal. Caine downplays his considerable natural charm and humor, and gives us a vivid portrait of a conflicted, disturbed, frightening man: he remarks in the extras that though he has played rather few villains in his long, sterling career, he was able to play this one, as people seldom think themselves monsters.  Whatever, he still has his characteristic cockney walk, and I still think him one of the greatest actors alive.The much-admired Scottish actress Tilda Swinton(The Deep End,The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader) plays  Annemarie Livi, French judge with a Jewish father.  (French judges have many more powers than American or British, including the ability to investigate and follow cases.)  Handsome Jeremy Northam (The Tudors: The Complete Series) plays Colonel Roux, whom Livi taps to work with her on the case.  Alan Bates (Oliver's Travels,Women in Love) plays Armand Bertier, high French official, who has a long standing friendship with the Livi family.  The beautiful and mysterious actress Charlotte Rampling, who jump-started her career with Luchino Visconti'sThe Damned, and thenThe Night Porter (The Criterion Collection), before moving to France to live with her French musician husband Maurice Jarre, and play in several successful French films, is wasted in the small part of Brossard's wife Nicole.  Other well-known British players, including John Neville, Ciaran Hinds, Frank Finlay, Malcolm Sinclair, Edward Petherbridge, Colin Salmon and David de Keyser round out the cast in supporting roles.  Thank goodness, the disk has subtitles, as all these well-bred Britishers never raise their voices.The film was directed by the talented, Canadian-born Norman Jewison (FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, MOONSTRUCK, HEAT OF THE NIGHT).  It was based on the novel of the same name, which was apparently based on a true story, by the Irish-Canadian novelist/screenwriter Brian Moore (THE LONELY PASSION OF JUDITH HEARNE, TORN CURTAIN, THE LUCK OF GINGER COFFEY).  He was said to be the favorite young writer of the extraordinary Graham Greene, the Catholic convert novelist who explored his new religion until his death.  And who else but an Irishman such as Moore would dare to show the Church in such an unflattering light?  The South African born actor/screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, also an Oscar winner (THE PIANIST, THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY), penned the script.  Well, all this talent has put together a confusing, badly-organized motion picture.  But it's worth seeing once, particularly if you are a Michael Caine fan, as am I.",3,"So Much Talent, Such a Big Flop, Still Worth Seeing",1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,4886,"['Statement', '120',

Caine plays Pierre Brossard a minor French war criminal who was responsable for the murder of seven French Jews. I say minor only because others murdered many thousands more and it is clear from this film that others did worse and continued to prosper in post war France.Brossard has been hidden for years with the aid of the Catholic Church but it appears that a Jewish group has tracked him down and is planning his murder. Unknown to Brossard the Jewish group is a ruse and the real people out to kill him are his former allies in the French establishment and police for whom he has become a liabilty.At the same time a judge (Tilda Swinton) and a Gendarmerie Colonel (Jeremy Northam) are trying to find him before the killers do.It is Caine's skill as an actor which allows us to be repulsed by Brossard, he is a coward and a bully, whilst at the same time feeling sympathy for him, he is a frightened old man betrayed by his friends.Frank Finlay and Edward Petherbridge are also very good in smaller supporting roles.The fiqure of Brossard was inspired by Paul Touvier who in 1994 was sentenced to life imprisonment after being sheltered by the Catholic Church for years.All in all a superior and thoughtfull thriller",4,A Superior and Thoughtfull Thriller,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,1843,"['note', 'reviewer', 'complained', 'film', 'slow', 'compared', 'normal', 'thrillers', 'depend', 'car', 'crashes', 'explosions', 'impossible', 'feats', 'human', 'agilty', 'expect', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'whilst', 'being', 'entertaining', 'also', 'think', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'anti', 'Catholic', 'true', 'elements', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'were', 'pro', 'Nazi', 'did', 'help', 'war', 'criminal', 'escape', 'justice', 'not', 'only', 'France', 'many', 'other', 'countries.Michael', 'Caine', 'outstanding', 'aging', 'French', 'war', 'criminal', 'who', 'forty', 'years', 'end', 'world', 'finally', 'facing', 'justice', 'sort', 'Caine', 'Pierre', 'Brossard', 'minor', 'French', 'war', 'criminal', 'who', 'was', 'responsable', 'murder', 'seven', 'French', 'Jews', 'say', 'minor', 'only', 'others', 'murdered', 'many', 'thousands', 'more', 'clear', 'film', 'others', 'did', 'worse', 'continued', 'prosper', 'post', 'war', 'France.Brossard', 'been', 'hidden', 'years', 'aid', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Jewish', 'group', 'tracked', 'down', 'planning', 'murder', 'Brossard', 'Jewish', 'group', 'ruse', 'real', 'people', 'out', 'kill', 'are', 'former', 'allies', 'French', 'establishment', 'police', 'whom', 'become', 'liabilty.At', 'same', 'time', 'judge', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Gendarmerie', 'Colonel', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'killers', 'do.It', 'Caine', 'skill', 'actor', 'be', 'repulsed', 'Brossard', 'coward', 'bully', 'whilst', 'same', 'time', 'feeling', 'sympathy', 'frightened', 'old', 'man', 'betrayed', 'friends.Frank', 'Finlay', 'Edward', 'Petherbridge', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'smaller', 'supporting', 'roles.The', 'fiqure', 'Brossard', 'was', 'inspired', 'Paul', 'Touvier', 'who', '1994', 'was', 'sentenced', 'life', 'imprisonment', 'being', 'sheltered', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'years.All', 'superior', 'thoughtfull', 'thriller']",The Statement

He's running from the French government, which as once pardoned him but is now prosecuting him under a new 'crimes against humanity' law.  He's also running from someone, perhaps a Jewish organization bent on revenge, trying to kill him.Micheal Caine and the other actors do an awesome job in this movie.  The filmography is also quite good, as well as the pacing.  On it's whole the movie was interesting, with the occasional small thrill.Unfortunately there were a couple of big holes, which never seem to quite get filled.  Micheal Caine's character, Brossard, doesn't seem to have a definite bent.  One moment he is a penitent old man, sorry for what he did in his misguided youth.  Another, he is threatening his wife, informing her that she will do what he tells her or he will hurt her dog.  A man that threatens his wife's dog just to push her into submission doesn't seem the type that would be too bothered by what he did over forty years ago.  This inconsistency in character really sticks in the craw of the viewer.  There are also problems with how the Catholics who help Brossard are portrayed.  The director never seems inclinded to indicate their motivation.  Are they a group of anti-Jewish clerics?  Are they just old men who think that another old man has been pardoned and shouldn't be bothered anymore?  Or are they just kindly priests who would shelter and protect anyone who was in need?  The movie never seems to make up it's mind.  These are somewhat large and disappointing holes in the plot of what should have been a really slick movie.  I can only guess that the Brian Moore novel, from which this movie was adapted, gives more detail than what the director decided to include here.  It's disappointing and I would have been more than willing to sit through a slightly longer movie in order not to have those sorts of holes show up.",3,"Pretty good, but could have been better",1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,2116,"['Micheal', 'Caine', 'Pierre', 'Brossard', 'who', 'once', 'massacred', 'Jews', 'Vichy', 'regime', 'France', 'living', 'underground', 'more', 'forty', 'years', 'help', 'friends', 'Catholic', 'order', 'Knights', 'Mary', 'Brossard', 'run', 'again', 'running', 'French', 'government', 'once', 'pardoned', 'now', 'prosecuting', 'new', ""'crimes"", 'humanity', 'law', 'also', 'running', 'someone', 'perhaps', 'Jewish', 'organization', 'bent', 'revenge', 'trying', 'kill', 'him.Micheal', 'Caine', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'awesome', 'job', 'movie', 'filmography', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'pacing', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'occasional', 'small', 'thrill.Unfortunately', 'were', 'couple', 'big', 'holes', 'never', 'seem', 'quite', 'get', 'filled', 'Micheal', 'Caine', 'character', 'Brossard', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'definite', 'bent', 'One', 'moment', 'penitent', 'old', 'man', 'sorry', 'what', 'did', 'misguided', 'youth', 'threatening', 'wife', 'informing', 'will', 'do', 'what', 'will', 'hurt', 'dog', 'man', 'wife', 'dog', 'just', 'push', 'submission', ""n't"", 'seem', 'type', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'bothered', 'what', 'did', 'over', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'inconsistency', 'character', 'really', 'craw', 'viewer', 'are', 'also', 'problems', 'how', 'Catholics', 'who', 'help', 'Brossard', 'are', 'portrayed', 'director', 'never', 'inclinded', 'indicate', 'motivation', 'Are', 'group', 'anti-Jewish', 'clerics', 'Are', 'just', 'old', 'men', 'who', 'think', 'old', 'man', 'been', 'pardoned', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'anymore', 'are', 'just', 'kindly', 'priests', 'who', 'would', 'shelter', 'protect', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'need', 'movie', 'never', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'are', 'somewhat', 'large', 'disappointing', 'holes', 'plot', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'slick', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'Brian', 'Moore', 'novel', 'movie', 'was', 'adapted', 'more', 'detail', 'what', 'director', 'decided', 'include', 'here', 'disappointing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'willing', 'sit', 'slightly', 'longer', 'movie', 'order', 'not', 'have', 'sorts', 'holes', 'show', 'up']",The Statement

He served on the wrong side, as a French collaborator with the Nazis, and he served up seven Jewish men to the firing squad, just for being Jewish. Since then, he has become a deeply devout and repentant Catholic, just trying to live out his days. Tilda Swinton is war crimes investigator, who will never let the atrocities be forgotten. She is determined to bring him to justice.Don't be fooled by the simple premise. Others are determined to bring Caine's character to justice, too, with a bullet at close range. Caine, the repentant old man, kills two of the would-be killers - one wonders just how dedicated he is to that apparent life of peace, carrying handguns even when living in retreat in a monastery. Then, it turns out that the monastery and the Catholic church as a whole are more than just a retreat for him. He's just one of the strands in a tightly-woven shroud of silence. And, despite his mouthings of piety, he's not above petty cruelties and manipulations.Swinton's relatively simple but driven character brings Caine's into sharp contrast. She's intense, blunt, and honest, with a gut-deep revulsion for the hypocrisy the seems to surround her. Nothing could be farther from Caine's character, who lives by lying, even to himself.I can't agree with calling this movie a ""thriller"" or ""cat and mouse game."" It's too quiet and complex for easy tags. The interest comes not from the action, but from the cynical view of political power and the open question of just who the good guys are.//wiredweird",5,Exceptional movie,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,1625,"['Led', 'two', 'exceptional', 'actors', 'time', 'today', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'old', 'man', 'one', 'who', 'served', 'WWII', 'served', 'wrong', 'side', 'French', 'collaborator', 'Nazis', 'served', 'up', 'seven', 'Jewish', 'men', 'firing', 'squad', 'just', 'being', 'Jewish', 'then', 'become', 'deeply', 'devout', 'repentant', 'Catholic', 'just', 'trying', 'live', 'out', 'days', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'war', 'crimes', 'investigator', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'let', 'atrocities', 'be', 'forgotten', 'determined', 'bring', 'justice.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'simple', 'premise', 'Others', 'are', 'determined', 'bring', 'Caine', 'character', 'justice', 'too', 'bullet', 'close', 'range', 'Caine', 'repentant', 'old', 'man', 'two', 'would-be', 'killers', 'one', 'just', 'how', 'dedicated', 'apparent', 'life', 'peace', 'carrying', 'handguns', 'even', 'when', 'living', 'retreat', 'monastery', 'Then', 'out', 'monastery', 'Catholic', 'church', 'whole', 'are', 'more', 'just', 'retreat', 'just', 'one', 'strands', 'tightly-woven', 'shroud', 'silence', 'mouthings', 'piety', 'not', 'petty', 'cruelties', 'manipulations.Swinton', 'relatively', 'simple', 'driven', 'character', 'Caine', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'intense', 'blunt', 'honest', 'gut-deep', 'revulsion', 'hypocrisy', 'surround', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'farther', 'Caine', 'character', 'who', 'lying', 'even', 'himself.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'calling', 'movie', 'thriller', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'too', 'quiet', 'complex', 'easy', 'tags', 'interest', 'not', 'action', 'cynical', 'view', 'political', 'power', 'open', 'question', 'just', 'who', 'good', 'guys', 'are.//wiredweird']",The Statement

Are they Nazi sympathizers?At one point in the film one of the priests sympathetic to Broussard says that Broussard is a good guy because he fought during the War against France falling into the hands of the communists.  But, still, Broussard was a Nazi collaborator.Also, the movie doesn't make it clear how widespread support for Broussard was among the police, the Church and the French government.I have the feeling that the people who put this film together were afraid to speculate -- or for that matter specifically indicate -- just how widespread the support for Broussard was in the Church, the government and the police.The movie itself is very well done.  I especially like Norman Jewison and Michael Caine's work over the years.  The DVD contains a commentary by director Norman Jewison that I wish included Michael Caine.
