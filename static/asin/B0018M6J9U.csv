1160472,AOE7LVHSVID6Q,B0018M6J9U,Carol,"[0, 0]","The American Mall is a fun, upbeat, entertaining movie. It's about a young woman named Ally (Nina Dobrev from ""The Vampire Diaries"") she is a wonderful singer and songwriter. She meets a young man named Joey (Rob Mayes) who is working as a janitor at the mall, but also has a band. They get close and connect through Ally's music. Things get interesting when the spoiled daughter of the mall owner, Madison (Autumn Reeser), decides she wants Joey for herself. She stops at nothing to get him. Not caring who she hurts, she starts in on Ally's mom who owns a music store in the mall. I found this movie kinda typical. Boy gets girl, does something stupid and loses girl, then gets girl back by the end of the movie.This DVD comes with Special Features:Director Commentary Featuring The JanitorsCast CommentaryDeleted ScenesBloopersLearn To Dance With Bonnie(At The Mall And Don't Hold Back)Extended PerformancesMUSIC VIDEOS:Get Your Rock OnClearSurvivorYou Got That Light(By The Janitors)This movie is not rated, but it doesn't contain anything that could offend anyone.

1160473,A37K7N9KWCU2KM,B0018M6J9U,Cassidy Knight,"[8, 15]","*Note: This was originally written as a review on iTunes, where the overwhelmingly large number of 5-star reviews were just too much to sit idly by.*Yes, I am 21, but High School Musical (and especially it's successor) was a movie with a lot of heart, with a soundtrack full of catchy replayable tunes.  They say this is for the ""older"" crowed, that HSM is too ""tween"" and that TAM is edgier and more mature - well that ain't true.  Unlike High School Musical's, these songs are empty and hollow, the most generic music I've heard in a very long while.  I didn't think vocals could get worse than Hudgens' (who actually improved on the second soundtrack) but Nina Dobrev's - and the rest of the cast for that matter - is nothing but horrid, synthesized drivel.  And there's no one with anywhere close to the vocal prowess of Lucas Grabeel on this album anywhere.  It's a shame the only one with apparent true vocal talent, Neil Haskell, only got 3 stanzas of solo music in the entire score.As for the movie itself, it's highly contrived, and really, really boring.  Nina Dobrev's acting is no better than it is on Degrassi - which is horrible (her acting, not the show), for those not with the program.  The musical numbers have horrible segways, coming from out of nowhere, and ""Survivor"" is a complete music-video of a mess.  The cinematography and editing are admitably decent, but is that really important when everything else is screwed up so horribly wrong?  The entire ensemble cast is bland, and although I love So You Think You Can Dance's Neil Haskell, his sidekick role could never be good enough to hold me to a movie this bad.  Speaking of So You Think You Can Dance, it's sad that the only reason I was able to wade through the film was catching tiny glimpses here and there of dancers who had been on the show this season (Matt, Thayne, Gev, Kelli, Bayli (Kelli's sister, also Bonnie Story's daughter)).  For even the most diehard fans of the dance reality show, it's not worth it.  Trust me.Comparing ""Work It Out"" to ""At The Mall"" (whose lyrics go something like ""at the mall, ooooh at the mall"") or ""Gotta Go My Own Way"" to ""A Little Bit of Heart Somewhere"" (hey sugar hey sugar hey, don't care what you say..."") seems like no contest.  Yet there's hundreds of people who attest that this is better than High School Musical.  Everyone has their own opinions and prefrences, but when something so blatantly bland and horrible is said to be better than something with a lot of heart, I get pretty darn confused.  Did we watch the same film?  Are we reviewing the same thing here?",1,Lets Be Honest...,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,2595,"['*Note', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'review', 'iTunes', 'where', 'overwhelmingly', 'large', 'number', '5-star', 'reviews', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'sit', 'idly', '*Yes', 'am', '21', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'especially', 'successor', 'was', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'soundtrack', 'full', 'catchy', 'replayable', 'tunes', 'say', 'older', 'crowed', 'HSM', 'too', 'tween', 'TAM', 'edgier', 'more', 'mature', 'well', 'ai', ""n't"", 'true', 'Unlike', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'songs', 'are', 'empty', 'hollow', 'most', 'generic', 'music', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'very', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'vocals', 'could', 'get', 'worse', 'Hudgens', 'who', 'actually', 'improved', 'second', 'soundtrack', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'rest', 'cast', 'matter', 'nothing', 'horrid', 'synthesized', 'drivel', 'one', 'anywhere', 'close', 'vocal', 'prowess', 'Lucas', 'Grabeel', 'album', 'anywhere', 'shame', 'only', 'one', 'apparent', 'true', 'vocal', 'talent', 'Neil', 'Haskell', 'only', 'got', '3', 'stanzas', 'solo', 'music', 'entire', 'score.As', 'movie', 'highly', 'contrived', 'really', 'really', 'boring', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'acting', 'better', 'Degrassi', 'horrible', 'acting', 'not', 'show', 'not', 'program', 'musical', 'numbers', 'have', 'horrible', 'segways', 'coming', 'nowhere', 'Survivor', 'complete', 'music-video', 'mess', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'are', 'admitably', 'decent', 'really', 'important', 'when', 'everything', 'else', 'screwed', 'up', 'so', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'bland', 'love', 'So', 'Think', 'Can', 'Dance', 'Neil', 'Haskell', 'sidekick', 'role', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'hold', 'movie', 'bad', 'Speaking', 'So', 'Think', 'Can', 'Dance', 'sad', 'only', 'reason', 'was', 'able', 'wade', 'film', 'was', 'catching', 'tiny', 'glimpses', 'here', 'there', 'dancers', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'show', 'season', 'Matt', 'Thayne', 'Gev', 'Kelli', 'Bayli', 'Kelli', 'sister', 'also', 'Bonnie', 'Story', 'daughter', 'even', 'most', 'diehard', 'fans', 'dance', 'reality', 'show', 'not', 'worth', 'Trust', 'me.Comparing', 'Work', 'Out', 'Mall', 'lyrics', 'go', 'something', 'mall', 'ooooh', 'mall', 'Got', 'ta', 'Go', 'My', 'Own', 'Way', 'A', 'Little', 'Bit', 'Heart', 'Somewhere', 'hey', 'sugar', 'hey', 'sugar', 'hey', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'say', 'contest', 'hundreds', 'people', 'who', 'attest', 'better', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'Everyone', 'own', 'opinions', 'prefrences', 'when', 'something', 'so', 'blatantly', 'bland', 'horrible', 'said', 'be', 'better', 'something', 'lot', 'heart', 'get', 'pretty', 'darn', 'confused', 'Did', 'watch', 'same', 'film', 'Are', 'reviewing', 'same', 'thing', 'here']","American Mall, The"

Now I admit that means I'm not it's target audience but it was cheap & I like Nina Dobrev.  With her in the lead role it was good enough to hold my interest so I give it a 4 on that level.  Without that it was merely okay IMO which is a 3 so you get an averaged out 3.5.  To put it in perspective, I think Hellcats on TV is far better scripted & better acted roughly in this target audience group.  So nothing earth shattering here but a decent way to pass an hour or so esp. if you like Nina Dobrev.My biggest complaint are the commercials you CAN'T fast forward of bypass.  Normally this is bad enough but these commercials are uterly stupid including Jackass & other stuff that isn't nearly as positive as the movie.  I mean you have how to be annoying advertisements on a be a good person movie.  It just seems like the ads don't match at all to me which makes it doubly annoying.

I'm 21 and even though this movie can't decide if it wants to be a kids musical or an adult musical I found it amazing!Its a remindes me of Rent in some ways as the songs go. Then they hit you with some songs that seem to come from High School musical's way. The singing is amazing in the movie. They was they sing together gives me chills. I like all 10 songs that make thier home in this moive.I don't even like all the songs in High School Musical, That ""Get Your Head In the Game"" always gets skipped when seeing the movie. But found all the songs in American Mall amazing and not overdone like the songs in High School Musical. Its nice to see a musical can be made for the older crowd then the little 13 year old kids. With songs that sound more rock band then gay keyboard sounds of HSM.Songs that stand out are ""Dreaming Wide Awake"", ""A Little Bit Of Heart Somewhere"", ""Survivor"", ""Sorry's Not Enough"" & the title song, ""Get Your Rock On""If you do not like this musical then something must be wrong with you. The story is good, the music is amazing, and gets better with every time you see the movie.I think over time this movie will outshine High School Musical and I feel that an Americn Mall 2 will be coming soon.

This paints Ally as something of a sneak, a character flaw only underlined when we see her sneaking into the Mall after hours to play the big grand piano and work on her heartfelt tunes.You'd think Mom would understand, for she too was a singer-songwriter twenty years ago, but her one single eluded thc charts and she got bitter, and now runs a floundering music store at the huge Huxley Mall, teaching kids the piano and remembering her past.  She just doesn't want to see Ally making the same mistakes she did.Soon a ""Phantom of the Opera"" element comes into play as we see a gloved hand pullling scraps of music paper out of the trash can under the piano.  Someone is saving Ally's abortive attempts at penning a pop song, and pinning them to a wall backstage at the Opera House--I mean, at the Mall.  When it turns out to be Joey, the janitor, I was a little disappointed.  Joey, like Ally's mother, is another failed musician whose dreams went up in smoke when his trust in another led to the theft of his band's guitars, amps, mikes, speakers and drums.Now the four janitors play pots and mops in their closet, in a spirited number, and soon Ally and Joey are writing songs together on the roof of the Mall, while a jealous and malignant force, young Madison Huxley, played by Autumn Reeser with full Anne Baxter evil, decides to destroy them both as a way to getting her father to admire her.  This part did seem like CAMP ROCK, as though young should feel sorry for the mean girls since they just want the approval of an absent and uncaring parent.Didn't you think it was going to turn out that, twenty years before, Mr. Huxley and Ally's mom had been lovers and that it was going to turn out that Madison and Ally were sisters?  Some passable pop numbers and some OK acting make this one a slightly more cynical and sophisticated take on HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, but I'm getting tired of shows urging me to hold on to my dreams and have faith in myself, surely they could have gone for a little bit more social significance than having the poor Asian boy dress up as a hot dog and never discover if he was gay or straight.",4,Sugar Sugar,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,2295,"['Ally', 'promised', 'Mom', 'will', 'take', 'up', 'bid', 'Ohio', 'State', 'become', 'accountant', 'sly', 'applied', 'New', 'England', 'Conservatory', 'Music', 'Ally', 'something', 'sneak', 'character', 'flaw', 'only', 'underlined', 'when', 'see', 'sneaking', 'Mall', 'hours', 'play', 'big', 'grand', 'piano', 'work', 'heartfelt', 'tunes.You', ""'d"", 'think', 'Mom', 'would', 'understand', 'too', 'was', 'singer-songwriter', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'one', 'single', 'eluded', 'thc', 'charts', 'got', 'bitter', 'now', 'floundering', 'music', 'store', 'huge', 'Huxley', 'Mall', 'teaching', 'kids', 'piano', 'remembering', 'past', 'just', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Ally', 'making', 'same', 'mistakes', 'did.Soon', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'element', 'play', 'see', 'gloved', 'hand', 'pullling', 'scraps', 'music', 'paper', 'trash', 'can', 'piano', 'Someone', 'saving', 'Ally', 'abortive', 'attempts', 'penning', 'pop', 'song', 'pinning', 'wall', 'backstage', 'Opera', 'House', 'mean', 'Mall', 'When', 'out', 'be', 'Joey', 'janitor', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Joey', 'Ally', 'mother', 'failed', 'musician', 'dreams', 'went', 'up', 'smoke', 'when', 'trust', 'led', 'theft', 'band', 'guitars', 'amps', 'mikes', 'speakers', 'drums.Now', 'four', 'janitors', 'play', 'pots', 'mops', 'closet', 'spirited', 'number', 'soon', 'Ally', 'Joey', 'are', 'writing', 'songs', 'together', 'roof', 'Mall', 'jealous', 'malignant', 'force', 'young', 'Madison', 'Huxley', 'played', 'Autumn', 'Reeser', 'full', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'evil', 'destroy', 'way', 'getting', 'father', 'admire', 'part', 'did', 'seem', 'CAMP', 'ROCK', 'young', 'should', 'feel', 'sorry', 'mean', 'girls', 'just', 'want', 'approval', 'absent', 'uncaring', 'parent.Did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'twenty', 'years', 'before', 'Mr.', 'Huxley', 'Ally', 'mom', 'had', 'been', 'lovers', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'Madison', 'Ally', 'were', 'sisters', 'passable', 'pop', 'numbers', 'OK', 'acting', 'make', 'one', 'slightly', 'more', 'cynical', 'sophisticated', 'take', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', ""'m"", 'getting', 'tired', 'shows', 'urging', 'hold', 'dreams', 'have', 'faith', 'surely', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'social', 'significance', 'having', 'poor', 'Asian', 'boy', 'dress', 'up', 'hot', 'dog', 'never', 'discover', 'was', 'gay', 'straight']","American Mall, The"

American Mall is no exception, unless you just want a story with some good old fashion lip syncing fun. Ally is the daughter of a women who owns an unsuccessful mall music store. Mom used to have dreams of being a star, but when they never happened, she made her daughter study business and refuses to let herself live her life through her daughter as most parents would. While playing her music at the mall she meets a teenage janitor boy (Joey) who is ""in tune"" with her music. During a three minute lip syncing musical number their souls entwine. However there is the pure evil mall daughter who feels rejection from her father so she takes it out on poor Ally. In an almost Faustian manner, she steals Joey away from Ally by making him her model poster boy.To pour salt in the wound she also steals her music to promote her store (PLOT SPOILER, if there is such a thing for this teenage love story). Eventually Joey comes to his senses and shuns fame, fortune, and a beautiful rich girl for Ally his soul mate. All ends well with everyone in perfect lip sync for the finale. Nina Dobrev at times comes across as another Miley Cyrus, while at other times she is more like Anne Faris. If you are a young teen or tween girl, this is a 10 star movie for you Cinderella. Us guys will just stomach it while you enjoy the bejesus out of it.No nudity, no sex, no bad language, just some minor sexual innuendos such as ""Is he a good kisser and how big are his hands?""
