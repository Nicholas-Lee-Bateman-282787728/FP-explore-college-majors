Barry ""THE reviewer""","[3, 8]","every time somebody writes a bad review you girls always reply ""well your stupid,bratz rule!"" and then point out spelling errors.here's a little tip: GET A LIFE!!!!if you're just going to stand here defending aginst negetive bratz reviews and talk about what dolls you have (OMG!!! I have Jade!!!!!) then this is proof of what my review said.I said: ""God,I'd rather listen to an album of those crickets chirping in my lizard's cage than listen to THIS crap,please don't support Bratz,or you will regret it sooner of later... ""and then some girl comes to defend Bratz comes in and says: ""We, will never support you or listen to you. I love Bratz dolls for 4 years now, nothing happened, and I am fine.""yeah, you're fine alright....your crazy and obsessed for Bratz,and you wait for more negative reviews to come in so you can go aginst them.So in the end: you're all obsessed, for Bratz. But seeing how the toy selection for girls is so slim (dolls, dolls ,and more dolls) I can't critizise you for liking them,but you need to go out more,there's more to life than Bratz, and in 3 years you'll outgrow them...so why not outgrow them early?",1,Let's get one thing straight...,1133395200,"12 1, 2005",2005,1138,"['time', 'somebody', 'bad', 'review', 'girls', 'always', 'reply', 'well', 'stupid', 'bratz', 'rule', 'then', 'point', 'out', 'spelling', 'little', 'tip', 'GET', 'LIFE', ""'re"", 'just', 'going', 'stand', 'here', 'defending', 'aginst', 'negetive', 'bratz', 'reviews', 'talk', 'what', 'have', 'OMG', 'have', 'Jade', 'then', 'proof', 'what', 'review', 'said.I', 'said', 'God', ""'d"", 'rather', 'listen', 'album', 'crickets', 'chirping', 'lizard', 'cage', 'listen', 'THIS', 'crap', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'support', 'Bratz', 'will', 'regret', 'sooner', 'later', 'then', 'girl', 'defend', 'Bratz', 'will', 'never', 'support', 'listen', 'love', 'Bratz', 'dolls', '4', 'years', 'now', 'nothing', 'happened', 'am', 'fine', 'yeah', ""'re"", 'fine', 'alright', 'crazy', 'obsessed', 'Bratz', 'wait', 'more', 'negative', 'reviews', 'come', 'so', 'can', 'go', 'aginst', 'them.So', 'end', ""'re"", 'obsessed', 'Bratz', 'seeing', 'how', 'toy', 'selection', 'girls', 'so', 'slim', 'dolls', 'dolls', 'more', 'dolls', 'ca', ""n't"", 'critizise', 'liking', 'need', 'go', 'out', 'more', 'more', 'life', 'Bratz', '3', 'years', ""'ll"", 'outgrow', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'outgrow', 'early']",Bratz - Rock Angelz

Cause think of it, look at their hair, their hair was moving like it was real, and not to mentioned they changed their hairstyle a dozen times, 4 different ones for each girl. And their make-up, they changed their make-up too, a lot of times, and their outfits, they came up with a lot of styles for them that would take forever to make, and their accessories, which their earrings moved around a lot too. And also, they had to make other people there, like other girls, boys, and not to mention make their outfits, and do the girls make-up, and do their hairstyles. And also, all the places they went, like London, they had to make a lot of places for that, and Pinz, that punk club they went to, and the mall, and their office, tons of places. And also, they had to write songs for the movie, they wrote 10 songs for the movie, so that took a lot of work for the people who sing it. And also, getting the people to do their voices, they had a lot of people, and they had Tia Morway, and other people that did voices for characters, did you know the person that did Roxxi and Fianna (on one of their Tv shows) is the same person that did Maggie from ""the Buzz on Maggie"", and the person that did Yasmin is the same person that did Yasmin is the same person that did Trixie from ""The Fairly Oddparents"" and Kimi from ""Rugrats"" and ""All Grown Up"", and the person that does Jade is the same person that did Zoe from ""the Proud Family"". Which probably took a lot of work as well. So, this proves that MGAE worked their butt off to make this movie, a ton of work, and they did a great job, I know people didn't hate it, but they want too cause they don't like Bratz, and you probably don't like them cause their almost better then Barbie now, I don't like My Scene dolls anymore, but their movie is nice, and also, some people never even saw it, and they say they saw it and say it's bad so people won't buy it, but it doesn't work, these reveiws need to be for actual Bratz fans. Like me. And also, most of these reveiws are worthless, cause wayyyyyy before this movie came out, people were giving it bad reveiws, well, hello, their movie wasn't out yet, they also said they copied My Scene doll cause the My Scene dolls boys were in a band in their movie, but that was in the movie, and I knwo MGAE wouldn't watch their movies, so they wouldn't know, and also, they said MGAE copied Barbie, well, that is not true, you see, MGAE first Brazt movie didn't sell that well, cause it wasn't that terribly good, so they figured if they made it CGI animation, then it would sell better, and it did, a lot better, not to mention they have their own TV show too, and magazine. So, Brazt fans, this movie was great, and don't let Bratz haters tell you that, cause, well, they hate Bratz, so why should we trust you? This movie was great, and the animation was awsome too, so don't listen to bashers.
