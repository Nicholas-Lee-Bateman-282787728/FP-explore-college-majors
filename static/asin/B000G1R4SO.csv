Burchfield,"[2, 4]","In general I liked the stories we were shown in fifth season but as always some needed more work than others. #5 Thirst,  Lexmas- they'd be hard to rewrite, #3 Hidden was really pretty good except that it all occurred in just an hour didn't it?, too much going on for so short a time.I think I liked #1 Arrival as much as any episode this year, #12 Reckoning was the 100th episode and was kind of sad but it had it's good points. The writing of just about all of the episodes was good, even if the stories were sometimes a little off, the greatest irritations were the way Jor-El still can't make up his mind to be good or evil, Lionel Luthor is first good, then evil and the way the Clark/Lana romance burned out (maybe it's by the book for them to not go on, but this way?).I haven't found the ""Look, Up in the Sky!"" bit but the deleted scenes were interesting as was the ""Vengeance Chronicle"" featurette. The worst thing about the packaging this time out was the new space saver form in which two discs are stuck on the same page/card. In order to get at the second one you have to lift the other one off first, I'd rather not handle the discs that much.

998495,A3TMC106MIY8S5,B000G1R4SO,A. Edward Azad,"[10, 14]","The horror....the horror....the Lana-Clark relationship never goes anywhere, and it never ends, like a horrible merry-go-round that you can't get off. It's one thing to have them not flirting, but they're still arguing in every episode, just like when they were dating! Unacceptable.Is it fair to trash a series, that was once extraordinary, for merely becoming a by-the-numbers, middling sci-fi show? I'm not sure. There were times I thought my head would explode:1)- The unforgivable misuse of JAMES MARSTERS (I refuse to type his name in anything less than all caps)2)- Lex and Lana dating is even less interesting than Jason and Lana dating from last season, an amazing feat to say the least.3)- Lana going from hating Lex (hmm, interesting) to dating him (gah).Either way, I have to conclude that this is the worst season ever. Michael Rosenbaum as Lex always gives 110%, even when he's given lines that make him sound retarded, so there's that.I won't waste time saying what's obvious: this show has seen better days. When Clark loses his powers, or gets them back, or someone has to trade their life for Clark's to balance out the universe, or spaceships disappear (over and over), there's no direct, cohesive explanation. EVER. At least humor me with a throwaway line of dialog, guys! Don't blow me off with something like ""You died, and now you're alive, and now the cosmos has to kill someone else to balance its budget, and for some reason, it's gotta be someone you know""!At least this show always delivers during sweeps....oh wait, no it doesn't. They just make Lois do a strip routine. I forgot. It's kind of hard to watch at times because you can tell Kristen Kreuk is really trying and that she's a good actress, but no one really cares about Lana. After 5+ years Rosenbaum looks like he's sleepwalking through the whole thing. Lois behaves as if she's stupid, she's never serious, and shouldn't even be there. I've complained about this in last season's review so I won't go into it.A nice change: some of the guest stars are really good this time. With the exception of that awful chick who played the ""Angel of Vengeance"". Did you notice how many successful films were ripped off for their plots? One episode is a point-for-point remake of ""Saw"", barely tweaked for a PG audience. It's insulting. ""Reckoning"", was meant to carry great emotional weight, but got torpedoed by a seriously unwelcome ""twist"" at the 30-min mark (cough!*finaldestination!*cough*)Ok, I lied. I will complain about Lois. What the donkeys is she doing there? These high-profile political jobs keep falling in her lap. How? The girl never works. However, if it means they will finally kill the aging Clark-Lana relationship (please....someone let it die...), then fine. But after five years of waiting I doubt it will ever happen.Now to review the extras: Oh wait. Just two commentaries, with no regular cast members, featuring Al Gough and Miles Millar in an hour-long exercise in self-congratulation. For some reason, unbeknownst to me or probably even the Almighty itself, they chose to add a commentary for the episode ""Thirst"".WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?????!!!!!???!!!!???!!!!Everybody knows this was the weakest episode. It's patronizing. It's ridiculous. Kristen Kreuk's little behind wiggling in a catsuit. That's the whole point for this episode existing. BY ZEUS, how many seasons must pass before they stop fetishizing Lana? It's ridiculous, and they make her character intolerable, constantly berating Clark when he does nothing wrong. Ugh. What a mess.Casting JAMES MARSTERS was utter genius. Making Brainiac into Clark's college professor was wicked! it reminded me of the old days when the show still surprised me. But the whole thing was basically squandered. He was just used as a device for the Clark vs. Zod thing toward the end. He was not a very formidible villain, either. Blasphemy! You do not cast JAMES MARSTERS and NOT make him the main villain. He's really good here too! What a waste.Let me close by reminding people that Lois Lane is a college dropout.

Gammill,"[12, 14]","After that silly witches and stones business (not to mention the Teagues...yawn) in season four, SMALLVILLE got back on track with this excellent season (SPOILERS AHEAD).  The year started off with a bang, with Kryptonian villains, including the great James Marsters as Brainiac.  Chloe, now a keeper of Clark's secret, stopped being an annoyance and become a great ally.  Lex learned the true meaning of Christmas.  Two other DC heroes debuted: Cyborg and Aquaman (""Aqua"" is arguably among the season's best episodes).  The series even celebrated its milestone 100th episode with the death of a major character.What more can I say?  Oh, yeah, how about this?  The Fortress of Solitude.  An enemy learns Clark's secret...and (so far) doesn't tell anyone.  The Phantom Zone.  SENATOR Martha Kent.  The widening gap between Clark and Lex.  The, uhh, narrowing gap between Lana and Lex.Every season, despite significant and occasionally great individual episodes, had its clunkers.  These are hard to find in season five.

998497,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B000G1R4SO,Allan M. Lees,"[2, 5]","My children persuaded me to acquire this series (Smallville Series 5) on DVD and so we sat down to be serially entertained.  First, the good news: Michael Rosenbaum, who plays Lex Luthor, the antagonist to the protagonist hero Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman, can act.  Rosenbaum's abilities as an actor enable Lex to become the most interesting and compelling character in what is otherwise a sea of standard-for-TV mediocrity.  The other piece of good news is that the direction of some episodes is first-rate.  An example of this is the episode called Reckoning, in which the director coaxes creditable performances even from the weakest of the cast members and uses James Blunt's song You're Beautiful to masterful effect as incidental music.The bad news is that, in what appears to be the standard tradition of American TV series, there are simply too many episodes for the ideas they contain.  Themes recur again and again to the point where the characters appear catatonic.  The script writers are lazy, so their scripts lack internal consistency and they fall back on trite plot devices instead of taking the trouble to craft the stories more carefully.  You can almost hear the bored writers sitting around sipping lattes and saying, ""OK, what haven't we had XXX do yet?  And YYY wants an opportunity to show how she can do heartbreak so let's have the characters all drink something that changes their personalities, covers them in bright orange body hair, and brings back the dead.  Then Clark can marry a corpse and Lana can look crushed.""  (Note - if this turns out to be a real episode in Series Seven, don't blame me...)There's probably enough (intentional) humor and situational possibilities in Smallville for one really good series of about 12 episodes, but there's clearly not enough to stretch interminably over six series with 23 episodes each, especially given the limitations of the cast and the insouciance of the writers.  We did, however, appreciate the determination of the writers to avoid ""tights and flights"" which at least precluded additional embarrassment.

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[0, 0]","Leading up to this season, Smallville was more ""earthbound,"" in that it really was about a teenager with developing superpowers with only mere glimpses into his true heritage.Season Five changed the tone of the series forever.I always viewed this season as the mythology turning point for the series. Huge things happen and we're suddenly thrust from those Twilight Zone-oriented episodes into the DC Comics Universe; things shifted from a ""superboy"" to Superman.Significant events go down this season, including the emergence of a certain location and the death of a certain loved one. We're also introduced to a couple more characters from DC Comics continuity.For me, this was the season where the show grew up and strolled down the Superman road with purpose instead of by happenstance. (Those who've seen the show know what I mean.)The only thing that irked me about this season and going into the next was the whole Clark and Lana thing was getting played out and it seemed the romantic subplot of the show was going in circles instead of officially stating, ""Let's get these guys together for real and keep it that way."" But, as per usual TV show fashion, something always has to happen to drive the couple apart. Though romantic tension is good up to a point, Smallville set the bar high in terms of driving the audience nuts--even to the point of bad-TV frustration--with the Clark and Lana relationship. Sometimes we as viewers just want to see things work out, you know?Other than that, good times to be had in Season Five of Smallville.Recommended.A.P.

998504,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000G1R4SO,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[12, 15]","There seems to be a split down the middle amongst fans over season five of Smallville. Personally, I found season five to be one of the most interesting, exciting, and well made seasons of the show to date. Relationships were forever changed, new ones were forming, people we loved were taken away, an interesting new villain appeared in the form of one of the genre's best and most popular actors, and two main characters were inching their way closer and closer to their destinies. Season five was a big time winner to me, and it shadows magnificent things to come in the future. The season got off to the right start with the season premiere, ""Arrival"", an exciting opener with slam bang action, effects, and the introduction of the Fortress Of Solitude. Other notable episodes here include ""Mortal"" and ""Hidden"", which finds Clark and Lana moving along with their relationship and Clark facing obstacles powerless. ""Aqua"" features the debut of Aquaman, but the episode was flat and, um, all wet. ""Thirst"" was a silly Halloween episode that was catered to be nothing else but silly fun and a wink at the audience. Carrie Fisher cameos in that one. There's a Dukes reunion in ""Exposed"", when Tom Wopat guest stars. The best of the bunch is ""Splinter"", where Clark goes all paranoid; ""Solitude"" that has Professor Fine/Brainiac(James Marsters)trying to help Martha and showing his true colors; ""Lexmas"" is the show's first ever Christmas episode, and it's the classic tale of Lex seeing how his life may of been different if he took another path. The crown jewel of season five was ""Reckoning"", the 100th episode. Jonathan Kent(John Schneider)passes away from a heart attack, and it's a key moment that pushes Clark closer to becoming Superman. ""Mercy"" is a wonderful episode that has Lionel Luthor and Martha Kent being terrorized and ""tested"" by a maniac in a very ""Saw"" like manner. Great episode. Season five sees the end of Clana once and for all, but it starts up Lexana. Lionel begins putting the moves on widowed Martha, but what are his intentions?. James Marsters of ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" fame joins the show for multiple episodes as Brainiac, posing as Professor Fine. He was the best addition to the cast. Not all of season five was great, but the majority of it was. Things were forever changed, and once Jonathan Kent passes on, the show is not the same, and that's for the good. Things have to change and move on and grow. Season five is an important season. It may be the most important to date. Things happen here that change the landscape of the show and set things up for further development for what we all know will happen. Season five is at times dark, exciting, sad, emotional, and everything else. A real rollercoaster.

Sometimes they changes like Cheers (Diane's leaving), have a wedding of a major cast member like Full House (Uncle Jesse's wedding in the season 4 box set),The trip to Californai (season four) and Europe (season 5) of I Love Lucy, Add a baby like Welcome Back Kotter season four (when is that show having a box set of season one!)-well you get the Idea. Well some things work well and moves the show to a new place and others fail badly and are canceled.So In Smallsville's fifth, we see the more agressive  Lex Luthor getting more power hungry and gaining more dislike and growing a large rift for Clark. In this season, Clark is becoming the SUPERMAN in trainning, learning the idea of great power and how to use it,  and dealing with death with someone close to him (the 100th episode)and not being able to change it. Lana is still the Kid sister type for Clark for is growing further and further apart from the future man of Steel and closer to Lex. Chloe and Lois are still there. and Other characters grow up due to situations throw out in this years season. So  the show's dark side this season is making this piece of TV worth watching.The stunt casting of Former Dukes of Hazard cast Member Tom Wopat (as a family friend), James (X Men) Marstens intro as Brainiac, Aquaman guest appearance(which should have been a series for the new CW network-It might have been better than Man from Atlantis!), General Zod intro and the death of someone close to Clark were hit and miss highlights to this year's season..but it still is GOOD TVSo am I waiting for season six, YES and this box set will be a great treasure of good TVBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD",5,A darker and Soulful Smallville,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,1772,"['fourth', 'fifth', 'season', 'most', 'good', 'Television', 'shows', 'have', 'life', 'changing', 'season', 'characters', 'Sometimes', 'changes', 'Cheers', 'Diane', 'leaving', 'have', 'wedding', 'major', 'cast', 'member', 'Full', 'House', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'wedding', 'season', '4', 'box', 'set', 'trip', 'Californai', 'season', 'four', 'Europe', 'season', '5', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Add', 'baby', 'Welcome', 'Back', 'Kotter', 'season', 'four', 'when', 'show', 'having', 'box', 'set', 'season', 'one', '-well', 'get', 'Idea', 'Well', 'things', 'work', 'well', 'show', 'new', 'place', 'others', 'fail', 'badly', 'are', 'canceled.So', 'Smallsville', 'fifth', 'see', 'more', 'agressive', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'getting', 'more', 'power', 'hungry', 'gaining', 'more', 'dislike', 'growing', 'large', 'rift', 'Clark', 'season', 'Clark', 'becoming', 'SUPERMAN', 'trainning', 'learning', 'idea', 'great', 'power', 'how', 'use', 'dealing', 'death', 'someone', 'close', '100th', 'episode', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'change', 'Lana', 'still', 'Kid', 'sister', 'type', 'Clark', 'growing', 'further', 'further', 'apart', 'future', 'man', 'Steel', 'closer', 'Lex', 'Chloe', 'Lois', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'Other', 'characters', 'grow', 'up', 'due', 'situations', 'throw', 'out', 'years', 'season', 'show', 'dark', 'side', 'season', 'making', 'piece', 'TV', 'watching.The', 'stunt', 'casting', 'Former', 'Dukes', 'Hazard', 'cast', 'Member', 'Tom', 'Wopat', 'family', 'friend', 'James', 'X', 'Men', 'intro', 'Brainiac', 'Aquaman', 'guest', 'appearance', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'series', 'new', 'CW', 'network-It', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Man', 'Atlantis', 'General', 'Zod', 'intro', 'death', 'someone', 'close', 'Clark', 'were', 'hit', 'miss', 'highlights', 'year', 'season..but', 'still', 'GOOD', 'TVSo', 'am', 'waiting', 'season', 'six', 'YES', 'box', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'treasure', 'good', 'TVBennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",Smallville: Season 5

But the episodes soon grow much more sophisticated, especially after the episode where one of the main characters dies. It does cause the show to go in an entirely different direction after the crazy ride that episode takes us on. The characters and their relationships change dramatically this season, making things all the more interesting and things are poised to be even better in season 6.

In direct opposition to season four's disastrous story arch involving Isobel and the Teague family attempting to manipulate Lana, this one takes a much more serious (and yet enjoyable) path through Clark's choices and their ultimate consequences. It also shifts the love interest from Clark and Lana to Lex and Lana, something they have been hinting at four seasons and only now have the courage to bring out.Lex Luthor and Jonathan Kent do battle to become state senator, Lionel Luthor switches sides (again), Clark consummates his love for Lana and then is forced to give her up, Chloe starts working for the Daily Planet, one of the leading cast members is killed off, and it winds up in the most explosive, dramatic, and powerful season finale of the series.It's rare that I have enjoyed almost every episode in a season, but there is some solid stuff here -- ""Lexmas"" is a heart-ripping ""what if"" featuring Lex's alternate life if he is to choose the path of good, with a sadistic twist in the second half to make Stephen King take a step back; ""Tomb"" is a fantastically fun ghost story in which Allison Mack plays an alternate Chloe; ""Reckoning"" brings two consecutive deaths and a painful funereal; ""Mercy"" revolves around the charisma between Martha and Lionel when a manic madman forces them to make their way through his house of horrors; and five or so episodes revolve around the steadily building seduction of Lana Lang. Tom Welling also makes his directorial debut (and a marvelous one at that) in ""Fragile,"" an ironic twist of fate since it contains a super-hot first kiss between Lana and Lex at the end.I am a little disappointed that there aren't more features (one would have thought at least ""Reckoning"" and ""Fragile"" would get a commentary, and no blooper reel is unfortunate, since many of the actors have mentioned the various pranks and oops! on set) but will be delighted to own this season.

998512,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000G1R4SO,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 4]","One of the great things about a show like Smallville is that the mythology of the show continues while offering stand-alone episodes that you can watch at any time. The previous seasons had some solid episodes but they were usually inbetween some filler or just plain ok episodes. Season 5 does have its share of underwritten ones but the consistency is probably the best I've seen on the show so far. Since it's a big season I'll just mention the highlights.Season premiere Arrival has Clark making his Fortress of Solitude while a pair of Kryptonian warriors arrive looking for him. The Phantom Zone is introduced and there's even a mention of Zod. Aqua sees Arthur Curry joining the Smallville universe when he tries to stop one of Lex's projects. It's an alright episode but it mainly works for the geek factor with Aquaman. In Splinter, Clark gets infected by silver kryptonite which causes him to get super paranoid and believe everyone is after him.Lexmas finds Lex shot and him dreaming of a world where he's happy, married to Lana and good friends with Clark again but it doesn't have a happy ending. The big 100th episode Reckoning has Clark finally telling Lana his secret but things end badly and has to change it which means someone else has to take that person's place. Vengeance finds a new superhero, the Angel of Vengeance, striking a friendship with a grieving Clark but she's not exactly a role model. Victor Stone, aka Cyborg, escapes from a lab where he's given a metal skeleton and Clark helps him deal with people who are after him.Fragile, directed by Tom Welling, has Clark striking a friendship with a girl who can shatter glass. It's basically similar to the character Ryan from season 1 but this one works better. In a big Saw ripoff(or is it homage?), Lionel shows just how bad*** he is when he has to play the games set by a bitter stranger. Oracle sees Jonathan's ghost appearing to Clark telling him to kill Lionel and Fine continues to manipulate his way around Lex. Ends on a really cool cliffhanger. And then we have the season finale Vessel, where Clark finds out that Zod will be reborn under a new body and Clark has to kill him. Ends on a really awesome cliffhanger which thank god we get to see the rest played out on the CW.Like I said, the consistency in this season is strong but it does have a few iffy parts: Thirst, which is essentially a big Buffy homage, including a character named Buffy Sanders, is just not that great. Lockdown is another merely ok episode, same with Tomb which wouldn't work if it wasn't for Allison Mack. But unlike season 4 where there were few bright spots, season 5 is strong through the entire thing. One thing I can always criticize the Smallville sets with is having very little extras. The special effects are awesome in this season yet we get nothing. Commentaries for Rosetta and Memoria were perfectly picked. Here? We get Thirst and Solitude. What about Arrival or Reckoning or Vessel?However this is arguably the strongest season of the show since season 2 and well worth the purchase for fans.

The original Richard Donner films, at least for me as a kid, was my way of escaping reality and attaching myself to a character that all kids could look up to.  And in my mind, Christopher Reeve WAS AND STILL IS Superman(Sorry Dean Cain & Brandon Routh).  Which to say is why I originally had a difficult time coming to grips with a show that didn't dable with the titular character, despite the show's intriging premise of showcasing how Clark Kent would one day become known as the world's greatest hero.  I love how the show continues to explore the challenges that Clark confronts with each new ability(speaking of which, where's the freeze breath?)  But by far the show's best element(in my opinion)is how John and Martha Kent bestowes upon Clark his infamous humble nature by showing him right from wrong.  After all, Superman wouldn't be the hero that he is today if it weren't for their teachings.Now with all that being said, and as we enter the sixth season, I do have a minor complaint.  Honestly, I think Tom Welling has done a fantastic job portraying Clark Kent, but as any typical fan of the show will know, Tom is 30 years old now, and while he certainly has aged well, he just doesn't pass for the ""college student fresh out of high school"" look anymore.  Tom Welling is a grown man and certainly looks like a grown man, which is why it kills me to say this, but they're going to have to wrap this series up.  Considering how old the cast now is(and looks), it's kind of mind boggling to think that Clark still isn't in glasses(making identifying him as Supes all the more easier), and that Lois still isn't involved with journalism of any sort.  The biggest burning question on my mind however, is why does everybody still live in Smallville(or more importantly, why does Clark still live at home)?  SPOILER ALERT! - It's time for Clark to leave the nest and start living his own life with the knowledge bestowed upon him from John and Martha, especially considering that John Kent has now passed. Besides, in the comics it was John Kent's untimely demise that propelled Clark to seek out his destiney.After the dust has settled though, I really loved this season.  I just hope we start to see things change with the upcoming sixth season.  Because needless to say, if Clark is still living at home come the end of this next season, then it'll surley be the producers way of trying to squeeze every last drop of life out of this show.

I grew up reading Superman and even at age 60 am still hooked on the mythical character.  The Smallville series is a unique view of the Superboy character who, in fact, is nowhere to be seen in the series.  The best shows are about Kal-El and how he seeks his destiny or how he deals with his human-Kryptonian duality.  Frankly, about half the shows are completely forgettable and even accepting the physically impossible nature of the main character, other aspects are more unbelievable.  For example, did you ever ask yourself how all those twenty-four-year-old teenagers can get 24/7 access to the high school?  Ever wonder why it is that Lana Lang, who had more concussions than Troy Aikmen not to mention countless near death experiences, possessions, and strange illnesses, is not institutionalized for mental instability?  And Lois (delicious to look at), barely twenty, somehow runs a successful state senate campaign with the skill of James Carville?  Or why it is these high school/college kids speak with the linguistic skill and knowledge of forty-year-old college professors?  Or how Chloe can hack into any computer on the planet within seconds?  Please.  And there are just too many meteor-rock monsters in Smallville for anyone to continue living there.  Nonetheless, I'll keep watching when season six begins on HDNET.

BUT, there is still the continuous and ever dragging on of life drama. Once again, Clark Kent manages to mess up his chances with Lana and is still pretty oblivious to how Chloe and Louis Lane feel about him. At least Clark is performing Superman actions, dismantling a nuke for example. And at least he and Lex aren't friends anymore, and are finally enemies who duke it out in the season finale. With Jonathan Kent finally out of the picture, perhaps now the viewer can hope Clark will turn to his true father Jar-El for guidence and perhaps even TURN INTO SUPERMAN! But, I doubt it. This show is not really about Superman. It is just another teen drama with Superman traits. Its really about a kid with powers and a destiny he just can't deal with, living in a town with a bunch of really disfunctional people. The season started well, with Kryptonians posing a threat to Earth and Clark finding The Fortress Of Solitude. Except he defeats them in a single episode. The show is pretty much a downfall from there, especially when it becomes like THE X-FILES for awhile. The plotline having Lana see a spaceship and having people act like they don't belive her, was A LOT like X-FILES episodes. Not even an appearance by Aquaman could save this year from being so dull. The show finally picks up towards the end of the season with Superman storylines. Lex becomes a higher being and Clark has to save the world from his chaoctic actions. There is at least a twist to how the season ends, but not how it should have. With the newest Superman film coming out this summer, its just stupid that Clark was not turned into Superman this year.

The main question is, does that claim hold true?The answer is a resounding yes. As a ""Smallville"" fanatic, the fifth season was a wonder to behold. Romance, destiny, tragedy; this season has it all, and packs quite a wallop. The season begins right after the second meteor shower with Smallville in ruins. A ship lands, with two kryptonians seeking Kal-El. Back in the arctic, the Fortress Of Solitude rises. What a way to start the season! This is also the season we see Clark (Tom Welling) and Lana (Kristin Kreuk) in a serious relationship that ends badly, Johnathan (John Schneider) runs for state senator, Chloe (Allison Mack) becomes Clark's true confidante, Lionel (John Glover) channel Jor-El, Martha (Annette O'Toole) becomes Kansas state senator, Lex (Michael Rosenbaum) moves closer to accepting his evil destiny, and Lois (Erica Durance) is, well, Lois. We also see the arrival of Brainiac (James Marsters) and the coming of ZOD. Lastly, the life of a beloved main character is lost. This is, without a doubt, the best season of ""Smallville"" to date! The best episodes of the season are ""Arrival,"" ""Hidden,"" ""Reckoning,"" and ""Vessel."" Buy this and see for yourself! Here is a list of episodes followed by a rating. A star (*) indicates that this episode is a must-see.501: ""Arrival"" (6/5)*502: ""Mortal"" (5/5)*503: ""Hidden"" (6/5)*504: ""Aqua"" (4/5)505: ""Thirst"" (3/5)506: ""Exposed"" (3.5/5)507: ""Splinter"" (5/5)*508: ""Solitude"" (5/5)*509: ""Lexmas"" (5/5)*510: ""Fanatic"" (3.5/5)511: ""Lockdown"" (4/5)512: ""Reckoning"" (6/5)*513: ""Vengeance"" (5/5)*514: ""Tomb"" (4/5)515: ""Cyborg"" (4.5/5)516: ""Hypnotic"" (3.5/5)517: ""Void"" (5/5)*518: ""Fragile"" (5/5)*519: ""Mercy"" (5/5)*520: ""Fade"" (3/5)521: ""Oracle"" (5/5)*522: ""Vessel"" (6/5)*Overall: (6/5)Video: Just like previous seasons, the video is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen. The transfer is simply smashing. The colors are beautiful, and the picture is nice and sharp. (5/5)Audio: The Dolby 2.0 track sounds very good. The music, dialogue, and effects all sound great. No complaints here. (4/5)Extras: First up, there commentary tracks on the episodes ""Thirst"" and ""Splinter."" The ""Thirst"" commentary features the producers. This is basically a ""What the hell were we thinking?!"" track, and is quite funny. The ""Splinter"" commentary features the producers and James Marsters. This is a very informative track, and is very entertaining. Next up is the ""Making Of A Milestone"" featurette chronicalling the process in making the episode ""Reckoning."" The version on the standard DVD runs about half an hour in length, and is a great insight into making an episode. If you were lucky enough to pick this up at Best Buy (like me), then you are treated to a bonus disc which features the uncut version of ""Making Of A Milestone"" which runs over an hour in length! Its definately worth it to pick up the set at Best Buy. It is a great documentary, and definately worth a look. Next up is a teaser for the ""Look! Up In The Sky!"" Superman documentary. Next up are ""The Vengeance Chronicles"" web-isodes. These are really fun, and definately worth a look. There are also trailers for ""Superman Returns,"" ""Smallville,"" and ""Superman On DVD."" (4/5)Overall: ""Smallville""'s best season gets the best treatment on DVD so far. Excellent audio and video, and some really worthwhile features makes this a no-brainer. BUY THIS SET!!

The characters are still flat and lifeless, the acting is still mediocre and the characters are all still having the same issues with each other that they have for 5 years.  When I am in the mood to just watch something semi entertaining and brain dead, this is what I choose. Now don't get me wrong, there are those moments where I do enjoy it (obviously, or I wouldn't continue watching it each year), but by no means is it a smart show. If you are looking for a brilliant, witty, academically savvy show to discuss over coffee, this just isn't it. If you are looking for those then I direct you to Buffy the Vampire Slayer (don't laugh, this show is brilliant and has many a college class devoted to it), and also Veronica Mars (again, an incredible piece of work).

998539,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B000G1R4SO,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[7, 10]","I'm surprised that so many people loved this season. I liked it but I found some things hard to watch. When the ship landed last season I expected a lot more. It's cool that Brainiac is in this season and played by James Marsters (Spike in Buffy and Angel) but he's not used to his full potential. I wish the writers used his character as much as they love using Lana. To me though they've done as much as they possibly can with Lana. Sorry just my opinion. She's hot but how many more episodes do we need where she has a dramatic talk with Clark and leaves the barn walking into the sunset ? Can you say that hasn't happened in any season ? Things even get more dramatic between the two this season.They get together and even make love this season but you know that isn't going to last and that only bad can hapeen between the two. I mean by the end of the season she's telling him she doesn't know why she ever loved him. I just hated that and hated her by the end of the season. So I say why does the show have to remind us so often that these two can't be together. Since I love the show I hate the fact that I had so many negative feelings for it this season. With the ship landing the show had all the potential in the world but I think there's way too much drama between Clark and Lana this season. So I hope season 6 just relaxs when it comes to Clark and Lana. The writers love to come up with new ways to use Lana when they have no clue how to even use Lois. At least she's fresh to the show and not as played out as Lana. Plus Chloe is great and now that she knows Clark's secret she's mostly just used to listen to Clark whine and complain about Lana.John Schneider really grows on you as Jonathan Kent and when the writers had to choose who will die. They unwisely choose him over the 100% played out Lana. John Schneider at least gets reunited with his Dukes of Hazzard costar Tom Wopat before Jonathan dies of a heart attack in an episode while getting angry at Lionel Luther. Besides the Dukes being reunited I also like the Aruaman episode. Lex has something planned that will harm the ocean and the under water life. That doesn't go well with Arquaman of course. We also get a cool under water fight between Clark and Arquaman since Clark doesn't trust him at first. Plus it's also cool when Lex has Arquaman hostage and won't give him any water as torture. Cyborg from Teen Titans also makes an appearance and that's not a bad episode either. Lex once again shows his bad side by lieing to Clark saying he has nothing to do with the experiments that were done on Cyborg. When infact of course he's in charge of the experiments. Cyborg finds that out but I don't know why he doesn't tell Clark and Lana that. I guess so Lana can go through the rest of the season thinking Lex is great and that she can trust him.An episode where Lana injects herself with kryptonite so she can die for a minute or 2 so she can see her dead mother also doesn't turn-out that bad. Eventhough I guess the writers saw Flatliners too many times lol. What makes that episode good is that Clark gets injected with it and gets to see Jonathan one more time. Jonathan warns Clark that Lionel knows his secret. We also get an episode that may remind you of Saw as a Jigsaw type guy takes Lionel hostage and wants him to play a deadly game. That one even turns out better than you'd think since Lionel and Clark have a face to face meeting about Lionel knowing his secret. I think the episodes where Brainiac is scheming against Clark are the better episodes of the season though. Especially the one where he disguises himself as Jonathan to try and get Clark to kill Lionel. Stuff like that makes me hope they cut down Lana's part in season 6 and make Brainiac's bigger. Hell even make him a regular.What I don't like is the Lana and Lex relationship that develops after Clark pushes Lana away too many times. I just don't think it works. I always thought Lana was too smart to ever get with Lex or trust him 100%. I just found them sucking each others faces a bad direction for the show to take. Zod being on the show had so much potential and so many fans talking about who would play him. Instead Brainiac puts Zod in Lex's body and he hardly even fights with Clark. The writers love Lana so much that Zod even kisses her while being in Lex's body.  While the Zod in Superman 2 would've just said bow to Zod or why is this woman creature talking to me ?  Plus eventhough Lex knows Clark's secret you just know that since the show loves convenient memory loss that it will happen again here. Probably as soon as Zod is out of his body he'll  not remember anything that happened with Clark. I still like the show but I felt like I was watching a soap opera more than ever with this season especially when it starts the Clark, Lana and Lex love triangle. Next season Clark needs to fly more and just fly out the barn window when he senses Lana walking up the stairs. It would save him and the viewers a lot of time.",4,A Good Season but not my favorite,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,5006,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'loved', 'season', 'liked',

998540,A3HBNOC6ANFNSK,B000G1R4SO,Jonathan C. Pike,"[9, 28]","I started off a huge Smallville fan.  First couple seasons were excellently done, with a novel take on young Clark and Lex and the love triangle of Clark, Lana, and Chloe.  Then the 4th season came, and things began to go awry.  The plot dragged on, with the same ""Clark loves Lana, but can't tell her he's an alien, so Lana dumps him while Chloe looks longingly on"" storyline we're all so familiar with at this point.  Lana gets weird tattoes and witchy powers and you find yourself asking ""why?""  What purpose did that serve?  What was that storyline with that Jason guy all about?But nevertheless, we all went into season 5 with optimism.  And while it was undeniably entertaining, it also let me down quite a bit.  Same stuff as season 4.  Super lame villians (like that guy who could turn into sand.  What the hell kind of power is that? Oh no, watch out! I'll get sand in your eye!).  All strange occurance attributed to meteor rocks - honestly, how many of these rocks are there?  No Chloe-Clark hookup.  Lana still sullen and withdrawn.  Only real thing that got accomplished was the making of Clark and Lex as true enemies.So will I watch season 6?  Probably, but I really think they need to wrap this series up. It's clearly fading, and the writers just seem out of ideas.

998544,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B000G1R4SO,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[1, 2]","Season five of the WB's (now the CW) Superman as a teenager drama, Smallville produced a landmark episode, introduced a few new superheroes that show up in Superman's future and also saw the death of one of the show's most-loved characters.Early in the fifth season, the show reached its 100th episode, quite an accomplishment in and of itself, and that episode, ""Reckoning,"" was when the powers that be decided that a major character was going to die, and while most people could read the writing on the wall as to who that character would be, the show did tease a little bit, leading viewers to think it may be somebody other than Clark's father, Jonathan, but in the end, the newly-elected Senator Kent was stricken moments after fighting with Lionel Luthor, surrounded by his wife and son.Smallville explores the youth of future Superman Clark Kent (Tom Welling) as he learns to deal with his powers and how to use them to help others. This season was the first season that the main character and his friends were no longer in high school, so the show shifted a little bit, with a lot of action taking place in nearby Metropolis.As Clark struggles with his secret, another person becomes a keeper of that secret. Clark's friend Chloe (Allison Mack) learned of the secret late in season four, but she gets closer to Clark in the fifth season as he realizes she knows and finds himself becoming more and more comfortable around her. Clark's relationship with the love of his teenage life, Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) is another story, as he struggles keeping his secret from her. He finally tells her and in the 100th episode, Lana is killed while being chased by Lex (Michael Rosenbaum), forcing Clark to request a favor of his biological father Jor-El. Clark gets to live the day over, doesn't tell Lana his secret and saves her, eventually leading to the death of Jonathan Kent (John Schneider).Lana turns to Lex for comfort and finds much more than that, as the two begin a relationship that is certainly doomed from the start, but one that infuriates Clark as he truly believes the horrible things that Lex is capable of and doesn't want Lana to be part of them. Lana's romance with Lex also stems from a mutual interest in a space ship that crashed in the finale of season four and which Lex secures in the start of this season.At the start of the season, Clark and Chloe both end up in the ""Fortress of Solitude,"" where Clark accidently releases Krypontians from the Phantom Zone. One Kryptonian who comes to play a big part in the season is Milton Fine (guest star James Marsters), who also will be known as Brainiac. He is a professor at Central Kansas A and M, where Clark is a student, but his Kryptonian heritage is discovered as he tries to convince Clark that Jor-El was evil. The two do battle, with Clark coming out on top in the first round, but Fine seemingly getting revenge in the finale.Chloe takes her journalism to Metropolis University, where she rooms with Lana. Chloe also gets a job at the Daily Planet, where she uses all the resources available to her to help Clark fight against the evil of the world. She also spends a good deal of time with her cousin, Lois Lane (Erica Durance), who showed up in the previous season as a regular hinderance in Clark's life. Lois also gets the chance to serve as campaign manager for Jonathan's senate run against Lex and eventually as Martha Kent's (Annette O'Toole) chief of staff when she takes her  husband's seat.Lionel Luthor (John Glover) also discovers Clark's secrets and uses them to his advantage with the Kents, eventually leading to the heart attack that kills Jonathan. He also finances Jonathan's senate run against his son, knowing that the power that Lex is seeking will only make him hungry for more and he believes that is not good for anybody. Lionel also seems very interested in Martha Kent as the season winds down.The landmark episode was certainly the 100th, which featured the death of Jonathan and the break-up of Clark and Lana. In addition, the season also features the introduction of Aquaman and Cyborg, friends who will come back to help Clark in the future. The highlight of the season for me, anyway, was the episode that featured John Schneider's former Dukes of Hazzard co-star Tom Wopat at Senator Jack Jennings. The two really play up the whole Hazzard connection, right down to a 1969 Dodge Charger with a stuck passenger side door. I really got a kick out of that episode and was glad the two got to work together before Schneider's character died.This set also featured two commentary tracks, deleted scenes and a great behind-the-scenes look at the making of the landmark 100th episode, all solid extras on another solid set.All told, the fifth season of Smallville's only weakness may indeed be Kryptonite.",5,A

998545,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000G1R4SO,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[28, 32]","As I've said in my reviews for the first 4 seasons of this spectacular show on The WB network, ""Smallville"" just continues to get better and better with each new episode and with each new season.  This season proves to be no exception, the stories are more epic and dramatic in scope, the acting continues to be solid from all actors on the show (even the guest actors), and the special effects are absolutely brilliant, especially for a TV show budget (the rising of the Fortress of Solitude proves this).Many big events occur this season on ""Smallville"", beginning right where the season finale of ""Smallville: Season 4"" left off, Clark has thrown the crystal deep in the arctic and this causes a huge crystal fortress to be erected from the snow covered ground, thus his Fortress of Solitude is formed.  Clark must come to grips with many things this season; he must decide whether his love for Lana can survive all the secrets, is his friendship with Lex broken beyond repair, and last but not least worry about getting to class on time at college.  There are several big highlights spread throughout the season, the Season Premiere holds some truly awesome fight scenes and opens the door for many events that will take place throughout the remainder of the season; a dangerous villain from the Superman mythos makes multiple appearances, and a key figure in Clark's life dies leaving Clark wondering how to continue on, and another person knows Clark's secret and the revelation will change Clark's life forever.This series is like a fine wine, it just keeps getting better with age, with now 5 seasons under its belt, and gearing up for a sixth season, ""Smallville"" shows no signs of slowing down.  All the actors are terrific, generally I praise Tom Welling's improvements in acting from season to season, but at this point he's gotten the role down so perfectly there's not much more to say than that.  He particularly handles the key emotional points in the stories that take place at approximately the half-way point of the season, specifically episode #100 titled ""Reckoning"".  Michael Rosenbaum is awesome as ever as Lex Luthor, who in this season becomes even more increasingly dark and menacing, which is so nice to see, he actually is coming close to eclipsing his father Lionel in terms of despicable actions he commits.The writing and directing for this show have also never been better, as both strive to bring in more elements from the Superman mythos to further strengthen the 'Smallville' mythology.  And this season also marks Tom Welling's directorial debut for an episode, which was actually very solid for a first-timer.All in all, there isn't anything I can really complain about with this season of ""Smallville"", generally there is at least one episode that's viewed as a throw-away of sorts, but this season didn't contain any.  Even the ones that I just knew would be somewhat, subpar turned out to be really entertaining and contained some key plot points for furthering the season long story arcs.

998550,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000G1R4SO,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","I spent a couple of weeks watching the first five seasons of ""Smallville,"" and on balance I go along with those who think the Fifth Season is the best of the bunch.  ""Reckoning,"" the 100th episode, stands out because of the significant deaths that take place, but the whole first half of the season is overshadowed by Jor-el's promise that the price of restoring his son's powers will be the life of someone Clark loves (""Hidden""), so there is a setup to the big payoff.  What I think makes a big difference to the show is that Clark discovers that Chloe knows his secret (""Arrival""), because now our hero finally has somebody who knows his secret and can be a big help to him.  When Pete Ross knew Clark's secret it was just a series of problems every other week, but the dynamic is decidedly different and better with Chloe and even before the tragic events of this season you can see that it is Chloe, rather than Jonathan or Martha (or even Jor-el), who has become the person Clark turns to.  Ironically, even though there will never be a romantic relationship between Clark and Chloe, I can make a pretty good case that it is Chloe who has the same function on ""Smallville"" that Lana Lang had in the ""Superboy"" comic books, as the girl who knows the big secret, while still foreshadowing the importance of her cousin, Lois Lane, down the road at the ""Daily Planet."".Clark and Lana have some of their best moments before things completely deteriorate. Obviously you want to point to several unforgettable moments in ""Reckoning"" as evidence of that, but there are some equally strong moments in ""Hidden,"" aided at the end by the marvelous use of Dishwalla's ""Collide.""  I know we figured this out several seasons back, but I think it should be commented that for such pretty faces Tom Welling and Kristen Kreuk turned out to be pretty good actors.  Having James Marsters around as Milton Fine is fun because he not only gets between Clark and Lex but Lex and Lionel as well.  Obviously ""Reckoning"" is the biggie in the fifth season, but I think almost as highly of ""Lexmas,"" which marks the point where Lex irrevocably turns to the dark side.  I have long thought that the biggest legacy of ""Smallville"" to the Superman mythos is with regards to the character of Lex Luthor.  Even without the costume during his ""Superboy"" phase, Clark Kent is still the boy being brought up in the heartland to believe in truth, justice, and the American way.  But the idea that Clark and Lex were once as close as brothers makes ""Smallville"" not only the story of how Clark Kent became Superman but also turns Lex Luthor into a tragic figure and makes it worthwhile for Michael Rosenbaum to shave his head half of the year (showing seeing his future self wearing a glove was a nice foreshadowing of how a kryptonite ring will cost him his hand).In retrospect I was surprised that there were not more than an episode and a half to make up the period when Clark is without his powers (""Mortal""), and the idea of Lex Luther and Jonathan Kent running against each other to be a state senator does not strike me as the right move for either of them (Lex would not start with anything lower than the U.S. senate in the Herb Kohl/Jay Rockerfeller/Mark Dayton mold).  The DC universe expands a bit more in season five, adding the future Aquaman (""Aqua"") and Cyborg (""Cyborg"") into the mix.  With Chloe working at the ""Daily Planet,"" it becomes clear Metropolis is closer than ever, which for me is the ""Smallville"" equivalent of warp drive on ""Star Trek"", to wit, a narrative tool that allows stories to be told even though in ""reality"" the small town and the big city are a half a country apart.  But this is what happens once the ""Smallville"" gang graduates from high school, and like on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" going to college has proven to only get in the way of the larger story being told.  I also find it interesting that the role of Lionel Luthor in the series is growing while the writers reduce the importance of Martha Kent by suddenly giving her a career.However, I still maintain that introducing Lois Lane into ""Smallville"" was a big mistake, and nothing in the fifth season gives me any reason to chance by mind.  A chance meeting, such as Clark had with Perry White, is one thing, but integrating Lois during the Lana years is a monumental change in the mythos.  Of course ""today"" Lois Lane and Clark Kent are married in the Superman comics, but beyond the original key dynamic that Clark loses Lois but Lois love Superman what was important about them in the beginning was that she was the established big city reporter and he was the new rube on the block.  Even if we never get to that point (I assume the series ends when he puts on the suit, but then I also think that either Lana or Chloe are going to be dead before that ever happens), ""Smallville"" has changed that part of the story and not for the better.  Still, given that I have not liked the depictions of Lois from Margot Kidder to Terri Hatcher that have made her a bit ditzy for comic reasons, Erica Durance does combine confidence and competence in equal measure.  Then again, episodes like ""Exposed"" give Clark ammunition for their battles down the road.The main attraction in the Special Features is the featurette on ""Smallville's 100th Episode: The Making of a Milestone,"" which could have spent a bit more time in the writer's room showing how they came up with the story, and there are also excerpts from the documentary: ""Look, Up in the Sky! The Amazing Story of Superman.""  Then there is another series of Chloe's webisodes, this time entitled the ""Vengeance Chronicles,"" and a decent dose of unaired scenes scattered throughout the six discs.  There are only two commentary tracts.  Stephen S. DeKnight, James Marshall, and James Marsters have the honors for ""Splinter,' and then for ""Thirst,"" writer DeKnight and several producers show up to make amends for what they consider to be the one episode from Season 5 that they think was a big mistake.  It really is the comic tone rather than the subject matter that makes ""Thirst"" stand out like a sore thumb, because it is a bit over the top (compare it with the fun stuff in ""Exposed"" that reunites John Schenider with ""Dukes of Hazzard"" costar Tom Wopat, which works great).",5,"""Smallville"" hits the 100 episode mark going strong",1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,6303,"['spent',

998551,A2S9P70216QC2H,B000G1R4SO,"lenzino7383 ""BigBlue""","[0, 1]","Season Review-I don't know what to say! Of all the seasons of Smallville, I missed the majority of Season 5 during its original airing.  I couldn't wait to watch the episodes I missed as I heard Season 5 was one of the best seasons from many fans.  Buying Season 5 on DVD was pretty much the reason why I bought the first 7 seasons on DVD since it's much more enjoyable watching the series as a whole, seeing show grow with each season.  After I finished watching Season 5, I was shock at how put off I was by this season, as I times, I found it unbearable and watchable.  The season opens up strong with the powerful premiere, ""Arrival"" with Clark building the Fortress of Solitude.  That sequence and the scene of Clark walking into the Fortress where his father welcomes him is a pivotal moment in the history of the series. Not to mention, a black ship landed on Earth to which 2 rebel Kryptonians arrived and begin to wreck havoc on Smallville looking for Clark. The next 2 episodes are also excellent. ""Mortal"" is a great look at how Clark is mor heroic without his powers once again and ""Hidden"" is one of the most suspenseful episodes of the series yet.  But from there, the season loses all momentum and derails in storylines and developments that are on the verge of being abysmal.  Clark and Lana make a second attempt at having a relationship, while it starts off pleasant enough; you realize that the Clana relationship is more melodramatic angst, less star crossed lovers like originally thought.  At one point, you just get sick of Lana demanding the truth from Clark and Clark whining about losing Lana.  It doesn't make for gripping drama; it makes for an annoying bad soap opera.  To makes matters worse, the end of the season saw the beginning of the Lexana relationship, which is hilarious.  At the beginning of the season, Lana almost hated Lex then suddenly after breaking up with Clark, she runs to Lex for comfort...I'm sorry...what! The beginning of their relationship is poorly written and forced with Michael and Kristin seeming obviously awkward during those scenes. The majority of episodes are some of the worst of the series: ""Aqua"" is a sub-par adaption of DC comics' Aquaman, ""Thrist"" is right up there with ""Spell"" as the nominees for worst episode of the series, ""Exposed"" is a lackluster mystery centered around a dead stripper, ""Tomb"" is a bland ghost story despite Allison Mack's stunning performance, ""Hypnotic"" is almost unwatchable, ""Void"" and ""Mercy"" are more blatant movie rip-offs, ""Fragile"" is a mediocre directorial debut for Tom Welling and ""Fade"" even sees the writers reusing old meteor freak plots.But to be fair, Season 5 has its great moments, no matter how few they were.  James Masters of ""Buffy"" fame makes his debut on the series as Milton Fine, one of Clark's college professors.  There is more to Fine than Clark realizes as he is none other than another one of his greatest archenemies, Brainiac.  Masters just oozes menace and evil, portraying the character with class. The Brainiac storyline was one of Smallville's most exciting yet but like Season 4, the writers treated the storyline poorly by either forgetting the storyline for a majority of the season or simply leaving it as a small sub-plot for several episodes.  It's another bad move by the writers as they waste another perfectly good storyline. Anyway, Allison Mack gets a hell of a lot more to do as Chloe when Clark finds out that she knows the truth about him. Becoming the future Superman's official new sidekick was exciting as Chloe continued to develop nicely and the interaction between both characters has never been fresher. The friendship between Clark and Lex seems to be over for the most part, I liked seeing the new dynamic between both men. It may not be hate yet, but they obviously don't trust each other as the lies between them go bigger.  Now without Clark's friendship, Lex grows cruel, power hungry, even closer to the evil tyrant he will become.  The Senate race storyline was an excellent way of showing Lex's darker side as he runs for Senator for Kansas against Jonathan Kent.  ""Lexmas"" is not just a fun holiday episode, but a surreal journey for Lex provided by his mother's spirit by showing her son a possible better life of her son.  Jonathan Kent grows as well when he struggles to win the race for Kansas' state senator.  It's the perfect storyline for Jonathan and sadly his last.  In the series 100th episode, ""Reckoning"" is probably the saddest episode of series when a shocking event that impacts the characters leaves Clark messing with the fabric of time but his father's death being the final outcome.  It's a heartbreaking farewell for John Schneider whose Jonathan Kent was the strongest portrayal of the character yet. Other great episodes are the double Brainiac arc episodes, ""Splinter"" and ""Solitude"", Victor Stone aka Cyborg of the Teen Titans drops by in ""Cyborg"", ""Vengeance"" features the saddest scene in Smallville history, and despite the plot holes left from underwriting the Brainiac arc, ""Oracle"" and the apocalyptic finale, ""Vessel"" end the season quite well.  The arrival of Zod development in Brianiac's plan was exciting as well as the moment Zod arrives in Lex's body as his vessel.  With Zod free, the whole world in chaos with a kryptonian virus unleashed and Clark slowly floating away into the Phantom Zone, the season left a lot to look forward to as Smallville season finales tend to do.After starting with so much promise, Season 5 quickly becomes what I think to be Smallville's worst season to date.  While there are some memorable moments and episodes, not to mention Tom Welling showcases some of his best acting work with ""Splinter"", ""Reckoning"" and ""Vengeance"". Still, the majority of the individual episode just brought this season down. Certain characters were misused (Lois Lane surprisingly!), some relationships made no sense (Lexana once again) and the series as a whole continued to forget what the series was all about.  It's kinda funny how Alfred Gough and Miles Millar declared in the Season 5 overview that this season was ""Superman in Training"" when there was very little training involved! There was so much potential, but there's very little outcome here.Season Rating: 3.5/10Video and Audio Review-Probably the best the series ever looked; it's not just the stunning widescreen that makes all 22 Season 5 episodes look better, but it's the spectacular special effects which seemed to have peaked this season.  The sounded has never been better.Video and Audio Rating: 9/10Extras-The commentaries continue to be some of the most hilarious part of the extras. There's commentary on ""Thrist"" where the writers have fun bashing themselves on how this dreaded episode could have come to be. Another commentary for ""Splinter"" is straight forward. Smallville's 100th Episode: The Making of a Milestone is a great documentary showing the whole cast and crew working on the 100th episode. The Vengeance Chronicles are mini-episodes that see Chloe getting deeper into the life of the masked vigilante, the Angel of Vengeance.  They are entertaining but filler extras.

The only bad show is the one in Season 4 when they are nearing the end of senior year and that boy keeps freezing people. I do have to admit, that in Season 5, I'm becoming a bit tired of what feels like at this point repetitive freaks who keep ending up in Smallville and how Clark has to fix everything. Had to fast forward through those parts. But I believe this is the best show on the air, I just want it to keep going and going. It appeals to both men and women alike.The visual effects of the show are OUTSTANDING! The sets, clothes, homes, everything is done with taste to the hilt. I love being inside the Talon (wonderully put together in a faux, Egyptian noveaux style: such soft, bright pastels), Lana's apartment, the mansion, Clark's home, the hospital (has soft turquoise walls and black and white checkered floor tiles), the sorority house...I could go on and on. The set is so completely appealing to the eyes. It would be nice for Smallville to have decorating book made based on the sets! That would be neat! The characters are unbelievably well cast - the writer of the script is a genius. Lana, Chloe, Lois, Lois' sister, etc, everyone is so beautiful, especially Fish Boy from Season 5. Lex and Clark are such studs.I went on Michael Rosenbaum's (Lex Luthor) website, God, he is so cute! So weird to see him as someone else. Anywho, Smallville hasn't become a bit old after 5 seasons!! My favorite episode so far is the one in Season 5 when Lex gets shot and has the ""dreams"" if you will, of how wonderful his life could turn out if he would only make the right choices.You know, people could learn a lot about improving their own qualities from the Kents, Lana and Chloe; they are completely Unselfish people who always want to make good and do the RIGHT thing - I love watching people who have such a bright light inside them.Blue Ribbon Show!!",5,My Favorite Show,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,1935,"['Smallville', 'Every', 'season', '1', '5', 'been', 'excellent', 'only', 'bad', 'show', 'one', 'Season', '4', 'when', 'are', 'nearing', 'end', 'senior', 'year', 'boy', 'keeps', 'freezing', 'people', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'Season', '5', ""'m"", 'becoming', 'bit', 'tired', 'what', 'feels', 'like', 'point', 'repetitive', 'freaks', 'who', 'keep', 'ending', 'up', 'Smallville', 'how', 'Clark', 'fix', 'everything', 'Had', 'fast', 'forward', 'parts', 'believe', 'best', 'show', 'air', 'just', 'want', 'keep', 'going', 'going', 'appeals', 'men', 'women', 'alike.The', 'visual', 'effects', 'show', 'are', 'OUTSTANDING', 'sets', 'clothes', 'homes', 'everything', 'done', 'taste', 'hilt', 'love', 'being', 'Talon', 'wonderully', 'put', 'together', 'faux', 'Egyptian', 'noveaux', 'style', 'such', 'soft', 'bright', 'pastels', 'Lana', 'apartment', 'mansion', 'Clark', 'home', 'hospital', 'soft', 'turquoise', 'walls', 'black', 'white', 'checkered', 'floor', 'tiles', 'sorority', 'house', 'could', 'go', 'set', 'so', 'completely', 'appealing', 'eyes', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'Smallville', 'have', 'decorating', 'book', 'made', 'based', 'sets', 'would', 'be', 'neat', 'characters', 'are', 'unbelievably', 'well', 'cast', 'writer', 'script', 'genius', 'Lana', 'Chloe', 'Lois', 'Lois', 'sister', 'etc', 'everyone', 'so', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'Fish', 'Boy', 'Season', '5', 'Lex', 'Clark', 'are', 'such', 'studs.I', 'went', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'website', 'God', 'so', 'cute', 'So', 'weird', 'see', 'someone', 'else', 'Anywho', 'Smallville', ""n't"", 'become', 'bit', 'old', '5', 'seasons', 'favorite', 'episode', 'far', 'one', 'Season', '5', 'when', 'Lex', 'shot', 'dreams', 'will', 'how', 'wonderful', 'life', 'could', 'turn', 'out', 'would', 'only', 'make', 'right', 'choices.You', 'know', 'people', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'improving', 'own', 'qualities', 'Kents', 'Lana', 'Chloe', 'are', 'completely', 'Unselfish', 'people', 'who', 'always', 'want', 'make', 'good', 'do', 'RIGHT', 'thing', 'love', 'watching', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'bright', 'light', 'them.Blue', 'Ribbon', 'Show']",Smallville: Season 5

998560,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B000G1R4SO,Newton Ooi,"[0, 0]","Probably the biggest failing of the Superman movies so far has been its superficial treatment of the villians.  They are all evil, and their wickedness is taken at face value without any inspiration or history.  This is where this series comes in and really fills a niche.  Lex Luthor is wealthy beyond measure, and his deeds are not inspired primarily by greed, as in the Christopher Reeve / Gene Hackman movies.  Instead, he is fueled by curiousity, loneliness, and a desire for others to trust him.  First, he is curious about the effects the meteor showers have had on Smallville, yet whenever he digs, Clark Kent is there covering something up.  Second, he is lonely.  Whether by his bald head, his wealthy status or the upbringing by his father, his most stable companions are books and the wisdom they impart to him.  Last, he needs others.  Of all the characters in the series, he reaches out to others more than anyone else, and gets rejected most often.  All three of this trends come together in Season Five to create the man that will become a monster.  Finally, a TV show that explores the villians as much as it explores the heroes.  For that, this is a great show to watch.",5,Ying and yang,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,1188,"['Probably', 'biggest', 'failing', 'Superman', 'movies', 'so', 'far', 'been', 'superficial', 'treatment', 'villians', 'are', 'evil', 'wickedness', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'inspiration', 'history', 'where', 'series', 'really', 'niche', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'wealthy', 'measure', 'deeds', 'are', 'not', 'inspired', 'primarily', 'greed', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', '/', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'movies', 'Instead', 'fueled', 'curiousity', 'loneliness', 'desire', 'others', 'trust', 'First', 'curious', 'effects', 'meteor', 'showers', 'have', 'had', 'Smallville', 'yet', 'whenever', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'there', 'covering', 'something', 'up', 'Second', 'lonely', 'bald', 'head', 'wealthy', 'status', 'upbringing', 'father', 'most', 'stable', 'companions', 'are', 'books', 'wisdom', 'impart', 'Last', 'others', 'characters', 'series', 'out', 'others', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'rejected', 'most', 'often', 'three', 'come', 'together', 'Season', 'Five', 'create', 'man', 'will', 'become', 'monster', 'Finally', 'TV', 'show', 'villians', 'as', 'much', 'heroes', 'great', 'show', 'watch']",Smallville: Season 5
998561,A3RBNLTA0UUFEZ,B000G1R4SO,"Nolene-Patricia Dougan ""Dougs""","[1, 1]","Clark Kent is back; armed with only super powers and flannel shirts, can he save the world from Zod...?In season 5 of Smallville, Lana Lang and Clark Kent finally get it together. Clark, who has temporarily lost his powers, feels he can finally be honest with Lana. However, their happiness is be short-lived as Clark's powers are restored, and he is forced into lying to her again. Needless to say, their on/off relationship is now off, again. But don't worry too much about Lana - Lex is there to console her... Clark, however, has other things to worry him, such as Milton Fine, a liquid-metal shape shifter (T1000 anyone?) who is putting into play a villainous scheme to bring back Zod, Krypton's version of a genocidal maniac.Season 5, in my opinion, has tried to be to be a little bit different from other seasons of Smallville, and not necessarily to its detriment. Quite a few of the episodes are movie pastiches; the most blatant would be Mercy, which is an obvious pastiche of the Saw movies. There are many other movie tributes this season; for example, Carrie and Stir of Echoes are touched upon, to name but a few. I love movie references, personally: recognizing them is the only time that I, as a total movie geek, can feel superior to others, and it is also the only time when I know that all those hours watching low-budget horror flicks has not been wasted!?! But the homage does not stop at the movies for this season. One episode has a vampire called Buffy Saunders, who Lana just has to slay, and there's a reference to Shakespeare's Hamlet in another - very highbrow for what is quintessentially a teenage drama.For those among you who aren't distracted by allusions to other forms of popular culture, there is plenty to entertain in this season's Smallville. Lex is as shady and charismatic as usual, Chloe and Clark kiss, and Lois is her angst-filled, no- nonsense self.Like all the other seasons of Smallville, this show owes more to programmes like X Files than it does to the original Superman comics, with the supernatural rather than the extraterrestrial element penetrating every episode.

The first half of the season is very good, with a few bad episodes in there. But by the second half of the season, you'll be saying, ""When is the story going to be moving along???!!!"" It does, but not until the season is practically over. There are some horrible episodes, like a ""Saw"" rip off. These kind of episodes add nothing to the season and are horribly out of place. The season ultimately pulls it all together, showing an amazing finale, but leaving us with even more questions. My biggest problem with the season, is the treatment of Lana. The writers have decided to write the character off as a complete and ignorant idiot. This is such a shame since Lana added so much to the previous seasons.The acting in this season is perhaps the best of any season. It's a job well done by the main cast and supporting cast. It has some cool guest performances, such as Kenneth Johnson from the Shield. It does lack the new addition of cast members, which helped Season 4 so much.

Garrard ""the G-man""","[1, 1]","Inasmuch as season four ended with the graduation of Clark and friends from Smallville High, it was logical that the story lines in this fifth season would have the principals involved in situations that were much more problematic and adult in nature. Because of the ongoing ""growth"" of Clark (the much improved, actingwise, star Tom Welling) into the future Man of Steel, this season presents obstacles that confront him as a freshman college student, as one involved in a sensitive relationship with girlfriend Lana (the beautiful Kristen Kreuk), and as an alien tied to his past by the disembodied voice of his real father, Jor-El (the voice of Terrence Stamp). Add to this the strained friendship with Lex Luthor (the brilliant Michael Rosenbaum), the reappearance of the sinister Milton Fine (the equally brilliant James Marsters), and the occasional meteor freak, and you have a top-caliber science fiction drama.Besides the superb performances of the aforementioned actors, season five allows the remaining stars (Allison Mack, John Glover, and Annette O'Toole) the chance to really shine throughout the year's installments.Most significantly, John Schneider gets an episode that becomes one of the pivotal moments in the show's run.Erica Durance really comes to fruition in her role as the always-ready-with-a-quick-retort Lois Lane.The season is filled with rebirths, deaths, resurrections, and lots of deceit, the latter the result of everyone, at one time or another, keeping a secret from another.Because of the dark turn of the series, there are some images that might warrant parental guidance in regards allow younger family members to view them. A couple of characters are impaled, one is incinerated, there are several deaths by gunshot, and fiery explosions and car crashes occur more than once. Such scenes might be unnerving to younger viewers.Also, two installments have implied sex scenes that are a tad too suggestive for the small fry.The extras on the disc include an informative making of the 100th episode and a ""mini-series,"" of sorts, that deals with a character introduced in the ""Vengeance"" installment.As a whole, this is a great season but should be viewed and discussed by parents before allowing impressionable children to watch them.",5,The show matures as do the characters!,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,2269,"['Inasmuch', 'season', 'four', 'ended', 'graduation', 'Clark', 'friends', 'Smallville', 'High', 'was', 'logical', 'story', 'lines', 'fifth', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'principals', 'involved', 'situations', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'problematic', 'adult', 'nature', 'ongoing', 'growth', 'Clark', 'much', 'improved', 'actingwise', 'star', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'future', 'Man', 'Steel', 'season', 'obstacles', 'confront', 'freshman', 'college', 'student', 'one', 'involved', 'sensitive', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Lana', 'beautiful', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'alien', 'tied', 'past', 'disembodied', 'voice', 'real', 'father', 'Jor-El', 'voice', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'Add', 'strained', 'friendship', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'brilliant', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'reappearance', 'sinister', 'Milton', 'Fine', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'James', 'Marsters', 'occasional', 'meteor', 'freak', 'have', 'top-caliber', 'science', 'fiction', 'superb', 'performances', 'aforementioned', 'actors', 'season', 'five', 'remaining', 'stars', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'John', 'Glover', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'chance', 'really', 'shine', 'year', 'installments.Most', 'significantly', 'John', 'Schneider', 'episode', 'one', 'pivotal', 'moments', 'show', 'run.Erica', 'Durance', 'really', 'fruition', 'role', 'always-ready-with-a-quick-retort', 'Lois', 'Lane.The', 'season', 'filled', 'rebirths', 'deaths', 'resurrections', 'lots', 'deceit', 'latter', 'result', 'everyone', 'one', 'time', 'keeping', 'secret', 'another.Because', 'dark', 'turn', 'series', 'are', 'images', 'might', 'warrant', 'parental', 'guidance', 'regards', 'allow', 'younger', 'family', 'members', 'view', 'couple', 'characters', 'are', 'impaled', 'one', 'incinerated', 'are', 'several', 'deaths', 'gunshot', 'fiery', 'explosions', 'car', 'crashes', 'occur', 'more', 'once', 'Such', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'unnerving', 'younger', 'viewers.Also', 'two', 'installments', 'have', 'implied', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'tad', 'too', 'suggestive', 'small', 'fry.The', 'extras', 'disc', 'include', 'informative', 'making', '100th', 'episode', 'mini-series', 'sorts', 'deals', 'character', 'introduced', 'Vengeance', 'installment.As', 'whole', 'great', 'season', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'discussed', 'parents', 'allowing', 'impressionable', 'children', 'watch']",Smallville: Season 5

998570,A3559I6Q7RCPP3,B000G1R4SO,"Robert Cossaboon ""devil doll""","[4, 5]","The Smallville series may be likened to a swinging pendulum at times.  If the second season was uplifting, the third season very dark, and the fourth just plain whacky, then the fifth season has swung back to a more somber tone.  If some themes had to be pigeonholed for this season, then it would have to do with the wielding of power, and the responsibility that comes with it-not only in the action of its exercise, but in the acceptance of its consequences afterward.  In this season Clark has to make some life-defining decisions-and they aren't always the right ones.  If you're looking for character development, forget it.  All the primaries seem to be stuck in the same mode as from the second season.  Lex is still secretive, Chloe doggedly loyal, Lana forever stuck in I-can't-do-this-anymore- emotional mode, Martha and Jonathan Kent sagely and parental with no hidden secrets or agendas, and Lionel ambiguously helpful.  This is not to imply the series is beginning to get mired in stupid, boring repetitive stories.  One of the refreshing twists brought into this season is the addition of Milton Fine, cunningly played by James Marsters.  Some of the episodes, however, were woefully redundant:  ""Mortal""-Clark loses his powers...been there, done that; ""Hidden""-Chloe hooks up with a psycho who wants to do that thing that he does . . . remember that one?  There is also a blatent X-Files rip-off with the whole spaceship and the oil-like life form that oozes from it--the ship even looks exactly like the one from the X-Files episodes!  But, persevere.  There are also some really glorious episodes:  ""Aqua""-what's not to like about the Aquaman (or AC) in this episode!  ""Exposed"" reunited John Schneider with his 80's Dukes of Hazzard partner, Tom Wopat-there is a priceless scene of Lois going undercover as a stripper which is one of the highlights of the season.  ""Reckoning"" of course is classic mythology-it has it all through the parallel realities we get to see; aching and bittersweet, this is probably the best episode of the season. ""Vessel"" is also close-things seem to be heading down an unalterable path between Lex and Clark.  One of the problems many viewer may have this season is in the choices Clark and Lana (and the writers) make; to some it may seem as if Lana's character is unknowingly degenerating morally-she is certainly suffering from not having all the pieces to the puzzle.  Chloe's character seems to come out on top, as far as the female roles go.  Allison Mack is able to inject real pathos into what could have otherwise been a faceless sidekick role.  Lois Lane may still take some getting used to, but by now she will have probably grown on most viewers.  The extras for this season are very nice.  There is an extensive documentary about filming the 100th anniversary episode as well as a way cool Vengeance Files, which continues the ""Vengeance"" episode left off--there are some interesting cameos in this short episode as well.  The cliffhanger the season ends on is strangely appropriate, given the lack of directions the writers sometimes seemed to be suffering from in some of the episodes.

998571,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000G1R4SO,Robert Moore,"[14, 18]","Warning:  Numerous spoilers aheadI want to start by expressing my enormous gratitude to the makers of SMALLVILLE for trying so hard to maintain the integrity of this fine show and by continually trying to make it quality entertainment.  I didn't like everything about Season Five and I'm sure others disliked some of the things I liked and liked some of the things that I didn't, but the fact is that the producers and writers are trying more now than ever to take the show to an interesting place.Many fans of the show are upset with the Clark-Lana storyline, but I'm baffled as to why.  There was NEVER a chance that Clark and Lana were going to get together permanently.  There is this whole Lois Lane problem: this is a story in which we all know who Clark will end up with.  The only interesting issue has been why they would fail.  The reason has been building for several years, with Lana giving hints that she disliked ""otherness,"" which gives the lie to her late 5th century assertion to Clark that Lex's transformation into a superman of his own did not bother her.  On the other hand, Clark's persistent dishonesty and lack of candor to Lana continuously undermined any possibility of their having a close relationship.  Season Five is definitely the last season in which Clark and Lana will have had any kind of chance.  That was not just confirmed by their latest break up and her involvement with Lex, but by the enormously symbolic gesture of Clark's packing up of the telescope that he used in the Pilot to gaze at Lana from afar.By any standard this was a content-heavy season.  Just a few of the highlights included Clark and Lana briefly becoming lovers; the appearance in Smallville of the mysterious Professor Fine aka Brainiac (wonderfully played by BUFFY and ANGEL's James Marsters aka Spike); Jonathan Kent running for state senate and winning, only to die of a heart attack; Martha Kent becoming senator after Jonathan's death; and the mystery surrounding Lionel Luthor and just what game he is playing.  In Season Four Chloe had discovered Clark's secret and now in Season Five Lionel has discovered it as well.  But incredibly, the difficult to figure Lionel actually has Clark's best interests in mind, neither revealing his secret or in any way attempting to manipulate him to exploit his powers.  The moment when Clark, who has suspected for some time that Lionel knew about him, uses his powers in front of Lionel for the first time is one of the finest images in the run of the show, as Clark catches a falling cage containing Lionel and Martha, his face only inches from Lionel's.The only problem with Season Five was the same problem that has afflicted the show from the beginning:  the prevalence of too many weak individual episodes.  At its best, SMALLVILLE can be very, very good indeed.  The episode where Lex has his own version of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was one of the show's finest episode ever, as was the episode where Clark reveals his powers to Lana and asks her to marry him, only to turn back time courtesy of Jor-El after she dies.  And the episode mentioned above where a mysterious individual tortures Lionel and Martha is especially memorable.  All of SMALLVILLE's season finales have been memorable, and this year's was no exception, with the episode and season ending with all the major characters is dire peril.  As far as favorite moments go, one of mine was in the very first when Clark becomes aware that Chloe knows about his powers.  Their interplay throughout the season was great.  Oh, and the biggest shocker of the year:  Erica Durance + bikini.  She has to be the envy of everyone who was ever in BAYWATCH.  I found it humorous that several TV reviewers were inspired to comment on their shock how unexpectedly grand she appeared in a bathing suit.  In fact, with the debate about who should play Wonder Woman in the upcoming film under way, I will say that Erica Durance, a dark horse candidate at the moment, became my favorite.  It takes a very special individual to look anything other than silly in anything approaching the traditional Wonder Woman uniform.  Erica Durance is one of the few actresses on whom the outfit would be flattering.  She definitely has the physique.Speaking of Joss Whedon (who is writing and directing WONDER WOMAN), the low point of the season might have been the painful episode that attempted to do homage to BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  That was my all time favorite series and one of co-executive producers on SMALLVILLE is Steven DeKnight, who was one of the main writers on BUFFY.  He wrote SMALLVILLE's Halloween episode, ""Thirst,"" in which Chloe tries to break a story about a sorority comprised of vampires.  The main vampire is Buffy Sanders.  Yeah, yeah, we all got it.  Buffy Summer.  Buffy Sanders.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Buffy the Vampire.  But as if all this weren't heavy-handed enough, later in the episode when Clark was in the hospital, Professor Fine comes up to Clark.  After Clark tells him that his friend had been bitten by a vampire, the camera moves forward for a close up on Fine's face as the actor James Marsters, who had of course played one of the best known vampires ever on BUFFY and ANGEL, said, ""There's no such thing as vampires.""  Yuck, yuck, yuck.  I suspect they meant well and intended it as an affectionate gesture towards BUFFY, but despite DeKnight's best efforts, it just didn't work.Nonetheless, overall this remained one of the best shows on TV and definitely one of the most underrated.  My own hope is that the show won't be on the air much longer.  I would really like to see them bring SMALLVILLE to an end next year and restart the next year as METROPOLIS.  They would be able to keep many of the same characters, but move things to the big city.  There isn't much left to do with Clark as a pre-adult.  The only powers left for him to acquire are flying-on-demand (as Clark puts it, Kal-El can fly, but Clark can't) and his freezing breath.  Beyond that he just needs to develop his sense of destiny, that he has a specific purpose.  Also, they need a shift in priorities away from Lana Lang towards Lois Lane.  Personally, I've always wished he could somehow end up with Chloe rather than either of the LL's.  But like I said at the start, we all know how this story ends.",5,In many ways the most impressive season yet,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,6324,"['Warning', 'Numerous', 'spoilers', 'aheadI', 'want',

998576,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000G1R4SO,Sean Pasek,"[7, 9]","One of the things that makes Clark Kent/Superman so compellingly different from most other heroes, is that Superman is who he really is.  His secret identity is Clark Kent.  Most heroes, like Spider-Man wear masks and try to detract any notion that they are the man underneath the mask.  This is the on-going struggle of Clark in Smallville, as he constantly fights against who he is.  Part of that reason, however, is that Clark has yet to find that identity.  He doesn't quite know yet who he is, and who he will become.Season 5 of Smallville can be described as a transition time for Clark as he changes from a small town boy from Smallville into a man who becomes more concerned globally about what is going on, not only with his family and the town of Smallville, but also about what might happen to Metropolis and the rest of the world.  And let me just add that this is one hell of a season for this show!  You may have thought that you had seen it all in the previous four seasons, but the great team of writers who work on the show still have a lot of story to cover.  Check out the making of the 100th episode in this DVD package.  I love how the writers just fly around the conference table, kicking ideas around.  The success of any show truly rests in the power of the writers.  If you can't continuously come up with compelling stories, then it really doesn't matter how good your cast is.In this season, you will see Clark make the ultimate sacrifice.  He must also deal with the loss of a loved one, even more catastrophic than the death of Alicia in last year's season.  The episode that deals with this is one of the most heart-wrenching that you'll ever see. Clark will also find a most unlikely ally as he tries to fight against his toughest opponent yet.  I'm not going to reveal too much story here in case you haven't seen this season yet.In many ways, we watch the Smallville characters fleshing themselves out as they also transition from adolescence into young adults.  Chloe is working at the Daily Planet now, and she is Clark's most trusted and valued friend.  While she still has the thirst for the top story, Chole is ever loyal and faithful, and she simply won't put Clark and his secret in jeopardy.  Allison Mack has truly solidified her position on the show and helped to cement Chole Sullivan forever in Superman lore.  DC Comics has even announced that they will begin to integrate the character of Chloe into the comics.Lana is a character who is still struggling with her needs.  In some ways, she's become a very sympathetic character.  Emotionally scarred from so many tragedies and losses, you have to wonder just how much more she can take.  Kristen Kreuk still does a wonderful job of playing the beautiful but always hurting and lonely Lana Lang.  She gives her trust and feelings so quickly and completely, she continues to find that she doesn't receive the same level of trust and honesty that she, herself, so willingly gives.Michael Rosenbaum, who in my opinion, is the best actor to have played Lex Luthor as the corporate tycoon.  No longer a young adult, or a pawn of his father's constant ""games,"" he's taken Lex Luthor many steps closer to becoming Superman's greatest rival.  He's become a master of half-truths and manipulation.  There is a key episode in this season when Lex pretty much sheds the last part of his humanity for what he truly craves: power and money.  It is almost sad to watch, because we, as the audience, have seen where he's come from.  The writers have more than succeeded in writing Lex Luthor as a tragedy.Tom Welling simply continues to broaden his range as an actor.  If you don't believe me, watch him in the first season and compare his work with this one.  He plays Clark with that spirit of goodness that is not easy to pull off.  Tom has honed his acting to a point where a simple look is all that needed to tell what he's thinking and feeling.  This is a tough season in the storyline of Clark Kent as lines begin to be drawn between those he can count on, and those he can't.  Clark also begins to broaden his scope of vision.  He realizes that sometimes, he has to give up something for the greater good.  We see Clark slowly becoming the selfless hero that he will one day be.One of my favorite actors on this show is John Glover as the Lionel Luthor.  The show simply wouldn't be the same without him.  The Tony Award winning actor is brilliant each and every season.  This time, and in many ways, we wonder what Lionel's true motives are again, and how will they impact Clark?This season also saw the addition of James Marsters as Professor Fine.  Those of you who are not familiar with his work, he played one of the most popular television characters in recent years, Spike, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Few people are familiar with his stage work.  He is a fantastic actor, and Smallville was indeed lucky to get him on the show.This season sees the greatest Smallville episode, ""Reckoning"" that I've seen yet.  It is a virtually flawless episode that the viewer won't soon forget.  However, this season also has the worst episode done yet, ""Thirst,"" which is supposed to be a slightly funny spoof on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  It's a story about a sorority infested with vampires.  The writers are trying to be funny, but this is one of the those times when they don't quite pull it off.  While you might decide to skip this episode, I'd advise against it, as there are some key elements that are a part of this season's main storyline.This season has many surprises and thrills.  Another hero comes to Smallville.  We saw the Flash last year, and Clark even helps another hero of the DC Universe.  And, as you might have guessed, this season ends with yet another huge cliffhanger, and the appearance of a villain that will have you running for your Superman movies again.It's no accident that Smallville is the WB's number one all-time rated show (now the CW network).  The show has not lost any of its luster or the ability to continue to give us great stories.  The show is successfully re-envisioning one of America's most prolific icons and symbols for goodness and justice.  As Chloe states in this season, ""the world desperately needs a hero.""  And is there one any more compelling than Superman?",5,You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet!!,1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,6304,"['One', 'things', 'Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'so', 'compellingly', 'different',

998577,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000G1R4SO,Simon,"[12, 21]","Smallville season 5 is an improvement over season 4. Of course that depends on your opinion of season 4, which I thought was a garbled mess that under-utilized the main players, threw in pointless mystical story arcs and generally stalled the series for a year. So I was quite pleased this year when Smallville finally seemed to get back on track. Many familiar elements of the Superman mythos are brought in this year, including the Fortress of Solitude, kryptonian supervillains, and a T-1000 version of Brainiac played to perfection by James Marsters. Clark and Lana finally hook up, Chloe graduates to the Daily Planet, and Lionel is given his best role in the series yet.Then we come to the infamous 100th episode, with a character death. If you don't know who, I won't say. But it all seems done in a sudden, ratings-grabbing kinda way, with the cast member still prominently listed in the credits afterwards because the producers didn't plan well enough ahead to only contract them for half a season. And with that, season 5's momentum comes to a grinding halt. Lana ends up written as nothing more than a needy, trophy love slave. Clark is just plain unlikeable, so much so that the series' cliche of him busting into Lex's study and accusing him of something he may or may not have done becomes somewhat of an in-joke in the writing. Rosenbaum is still pretty good as Lex, but seems to be missing a few key steps in his transformation from good to evil. It's telling that the most interesting relationship isn't among the young adult cast, but between Martha and Lionel. It's the only thing in this show that still seems vaguely real.The season ends with a compelling cliffhanger, capping off the standard Smallville season formula: horrendous character development + bland weekly stories + fanservice + good overall story arcs + awesome finale. Make of that what you will. There's definitely shows on television I respect more, but just the same you'll find me sticking around for season 6.",3,So very close....yet so far...,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2000,"['Smallville', 'season', '5', 'improvement', 'season', '4', 'course', 'opinion', 'season', '4', 'thought', 'was', 'garbled', 'mess', 'under-utilized', 'main', 'players', 'threw', 'pointless', 'mystical', 'story', 'arcs', 'generally', 'stalled', 'series', 'year', 'was', 'quite', 'pleased', 'year', 'when', 'Smallville', 'finally', 'seemed', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'Many', 'familiar', 'elements', 'Superman', 'mythos', 'are', 'brought', 'year', 'including', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'kryptonian', 'supervillains', 'T-1000', 'version', 'Brainiac', 'played', 'perfection', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'finally', 'hook', 'up', 'Chloe', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'Lionel', 'given', 'best', 'role', 'series', 'yet.Then', 'come', 'infamous', '100th', 'episode', 'character', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'done', 'sudden', 'ratings-grabbing', 'kinda', 'way', 'cast', 'member', 'still', 'prominently', 'listed', 'credits', 'afterwards', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'plan', 'well', 'enough', 'ahead', 'only', 'contract', 'season', 'season', '5', 'momentum', 'grinding', 'halt', 'Lana', 'up', 'written', 'nothing', 'more', 'needy', 'trophy', 'love', 'slave', 'Clark', 'just', 'plain', 'unlikeable', 'so', 'much', 'series', 'cliche', 'busting', 'Lex', 'study', 'accusing', 'something', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'somewhat', 'in-joke', 'writing', 'Rosenbaum', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'Lex', 'be', 'missing', 'few', 'key', 'steps', 'transformation', 'good', 'evil', 'telling', 'most', 'interesting', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'young', 'adult', 'cast', 'Martha', 'Lionel', 'only', 'thing', 'show', 'still', 'vaguely', 'real.The', 'season', 'compelling', 'cliffhanger', 'capping', 'off', 'standard', 'Smallville', 'season', 'formula', 'horrendous', 'character', 'development', '+', 'bland', 'weekly', 'stories', '+', 'fanservice', '+', 'good', 'overall', 'story', 'arcs', '+', 'awesome', 'finale', 'Make', 'what', 'will', 'definitely', 'television', 'respect', 'more', 'just', 'same', ""'ll"", 'find', 'sticking', 'season', '6']",Smallville: Season 5

998585,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000G1R4SO,Tom Benton,"[6, 6]","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS WITHIN*It seemed like ""Smallville"" couldn't get much worse than its frankly absurd fourth season, but it nearly did during the subsequent season.  Season Five of ""Smallville"" is the season of change, throwing out one life-altering development after another, sometimes gracefully, sometimes not so much.  Unfortunately, though the fifth season clearly aspires for greatness, only on select occasions does it actually reach it.  During the first four or so episodes it appears as though the show may have actually reached the level of greatness it held during its first few seasons, but immediately thereafter it becomes clear that though the season arc has improved, the overall quality of the show is still barely mediocre.  At times, this season nearly falls to the rank of television trash.  As a major ""Smallville"" fan, I felt almost as devastated through this season as I did during the fourth season.  However, there were a few saving graces that convinced me to hold on to my fleeting hope that someday, this show may be as good as it once was.First off, as a major ""Buffy"" fan, the thing I was anticipating the most in this season was the numerous guest appearances of James Marsters as professor Milton Fine - better known to Superman fans as Braniac, the evil, brilliant android who survived Krypton's destruction.  Marsters doesn't disappoint.  He makes Braniac a delectably devious and intriguing villain.  The best part of this season is that it draws heavily from the Superman mythos, foreshadowing things to come while introducing major characters like the aforementioned android, giving Clark the Fortress of Solitude (a tasty development indeed), and pushing Lana Lang toward her destiny away from Clark Kent.There are a number of episodes ranking among the show's best.  In traditional ""Smallville"" fashion, the bombastic premiere picks up precisely where the last season's finale left off.  In fact, ""Arrival"" may be the series' best premiere yet.  ""Mortal"", in which Clark is left without his powers (again), is a surprisingly fun episode, showcasing a light-hearted wit that disappears instantly in the next episode.  ""Aqua"", though not a particularly great episode, introduces the character of Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson), a.k.a. Aquaman.  (""Aqua"" wound up as the WB's highest-rated Thursday night episode ever, spawning a spin-off, which was not picked up.)  ""Exposed"" is a blast, reuniting John Schneider with his ""Dukes of Hazzard"" co-star Tom Wopat.Then there's the 100th episode, ""Reckoning"", an utterly epic episode that throws one shocker after another to us, including the death of a major character (sorely missed in the sixth season, but a wise move on the writers' parts, one of the few times ""Smallville"" has actually followed the comics continuity).  ""Cyborg"" introduces the titular DC comics character.  Finally, the season closes with the super finale, ""Vessel"", an especially grandiose, bleak, and cool episode introducing a fan favorite villain who happens to have a strong liking of those who kneel before him.Those are the pros.  Unfortunately, the cons are far more numerous.  For one thing, the acting is for the most part stale.  None of the actors try anything new.  Even previously sensational actors like John Glover and Michael Rosenbaum have become bland by the season's end.  Maybe the writing is to fault for this.  The writing isn't just ridiculous: it's downright stupid.  The dialog is particularly awful - overblown, overdramatic, and without any of the realism or wit that makes the dialog in shows like ""Gilmore Girls"" and ""Buffy"" so compelling.  The directing, for the most part, is astoundingly uninspired and amateurish, and the music is simplistic and silly.Then there's the season's share of foul episodes.  That includes trash like ""Thirst"", arguably the worst episode in the show's history, in which Lana joins a vampire sorority and becomes one herself.  (That episode is worth watching, however, if only to see ex-undead James Marsters' deadpan delivery of the line ""There's no such thing as vampires, Clark."")  ""Mercy"" is an unbelievably absurd episode, a plain-to-see ""Saw"" ripoff, in which Lionel Luthor is taken captive by a man in a painted mask with a husky voice who, through televised messages, informs Lionel that he has ""a game to play"".My final beef is that the writers in this season seemed unclear as to an episode's typical structure.  When the climax has occured twelve minutes before an episode's end, you know you're in trouble.  Thus the episodes drag on and on to the point where they occasionally seem preachy.  What became of the concise, fresh writing of the first, second, or third seasons?I expected greatness from Season Five of ""Smallville"", so I suppose it's my own fault that I was so disappointed.  However, there is no excuse for a show that began so wonderfully to fail so badly when it's clear how to fix the series' many mistakes.  This season is still an improvement over Season Four, and has spots of near-greatness, but ultimately, it's a failure.  The next season, however, more than makes up for it.",3,"""Smallville""'s fifth season soars - and then plummets",1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,5122,"['*POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS', 'WITHIN*It', 'seemed',

It's all part of Clark's eventual destiny, though.  Lana finally grows tired of Clark's secretive nature and flakiness and rejects him, which is another element of sadness.  Lex remains my favorite character.  So brilliant, but such a tragic figure with an unhappy childhood, an unloving father, and a dark side that is all too easy for him to give in to.There is another great cliffhanger at the end of the season, with the dangerous and deadly Zod being released.Look for James Marsters as Milton Fine, who is actually a villain created on Krypton.",5,Still great fun and thrills...and some heartbreak,1271462400,"04 17, 2010",2010,686,"['fifth', 'season', 'even', 'more', 'super-fun', 'store', 'fans', 'also', 'heartbreak', 'death', 'beloved', 'character', 'part', 'Clark', 'eventual', 'destiny', 'though', 'Lana', 'finally', 'tired', 'Clark', 'secretive', 'nature', 'flakiness', 'element', 'sadness', 'Lex', 'favorite', 'character', 'So', 'brilliant', 'tragic', 'figure', 'unhappy', 'childhood', 'unloving', 'father', 'dark', 'side', 'too', 'easy', 'give', 'to.There', 'great', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'season', 'dangerous', 'deadly', 'Zod', 'being', 'released.Look', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Milton', 'Fine', 'who', 'actually', 'villain', 'created', 'Krypton']",Smallville: Season 5

As Special Features go this season doesn't have much for hardcore Smallville viewers.  Deleted scenes on every disc and a couple commentaries and the making of the 100th episode (which is one of the best of the series).  My favorite episode of this season is probably the episode Lexmas where the creators of Smallville do an obvious homage to It's A Wonderful Life but in a new way showing it from a villian's prospective.  And really humanizing the character of Lex Luthor as a confused, angry, lost kid who really doesn't know what he wants other then to not lose anything in his life in particular the main woman in his life.  This season also marks three high points for long time Superman fans like myself.  One the final dissolvement of the Lex Luthor Clark Kent Friendship.  We all knew this was going to happen ever since the first program in 2001 and I think the showdown between the two in the episode The Vessel really summaries everything the two wanted to say to each other and never had the courage to say to each other.  The second high point is the introduction of General Zod and Brainaic.  With the exception of Lex Luthor, Clark and Superman's main adversaries.  When I heard the name ""Zod"" utter on the series I thought this was going to be a special season and with James Marsters playing Brainaic I thought that was a genius move and how these two characters really effected Clark's life will move onto the next season.  Lastly, the lost of Johnathan Kent was another fans were expecting for quite a while.  There is a discussion between fans whether Johnathan's death was caused by Jor-El's powers or by the fact that Johnathan's heart just gave out.  I think it was a little of both.  It had been established since Season Three when Johnathan took a dose of Clark's powers that his heart had been weakened ever since and this was the accumlination of that problem.  Finally there is reason I am not going to talk about the Clana relationship because I don't think it is important to everything else going on this season.  I will discuss it in my season six review of Smallville but this season it felt tacked on.",5,"Great season, but why not begin with the 1st season.",1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,2696,"['write', 'reviews', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'episodes', 'season', 'please', 'stop', 'writing', 'move', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'spoilers.Like', 'title', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'began', 'Smallville', 'HD-DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Season', 'Five', 'instead', 'Season', 'One', 'anyway', 'was', 'good', 'season', 'review', 'fifth', 'season', 'lot', 'other', 'genre', 'series', 'hit', 'fifth', 'year', 'i.e', 'Angel', 'Charmed', 'etc', 'changed', 'dynamic', 'series', 'way', 'series', 'could', 'almost', 'never', 'go', 'back', 'things', 'were', 'before', 'Special', 'Features', 'go', 'season', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'hardcore', 'Smallville', 'viewers', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'disc', 'couple', 'commentaries', 'making', '100th', 'episode', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'favorite', 'episode', 'season', 'probably', 'episode', 'Lexmas', 'where', 'creators', 'Smallville', 'do', 'obvious', 'homage', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'new', 'way', 'showing', 'villian', 'prospective', 'really', 'humanizing', 'character', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'confused', 'angry', 'lost', 'kid', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'other', 'then', 'not', 'lose', 'anything', 'life', 'particular', 'main', 'woman', 'life', 'season', 'also', 'three', 'high', 'points', 'long', 'time', 'Superman', 'fans', 'One', 'final', 'dissolvement', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Friendship', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'ever', 'first', 'program', '2001', 'think', 'showdown', 'two', 'episode', 'Vessel', 'really', 'everything', 'two', 'wanted', 'say', 'other', 'never', 'had', 'courage', 'say', 'other', 'second', 'high', 'point', 'introduction', 'General', 'Zod', 'Brainaic', 'exception', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Clark', 'Superman', 'main', 'adversaries', 'When', 'heard', 'name', 'Zod', 'utter', 'series', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'special', 'season', 'James', 'Marsters', 'playing', 'Brainaic', 'thought', 'was', 'genius', 'move', 'how', 'two', 'characters', 'really', 'effected', 'Clark', 'life', 'will', 'move', 'next', 'season', 'Lastly', 'lost', 'Johnathan', 'Kent', 'was', 'fans', 'were', 'expecting', 'quite', 'while', 'discussion', 'fans', 'Johnathan', 'death', 'was', 'caused', 'Jor-El', 'powers', 'fact', 'Johnathan', 'heart', 'just', 'gave', 'out', 'think', 'was', 'little', 'had', 'been', 'established', 'Season', 'Three', 'when', 'Johnathan', 'took', 'dose', 'Clark', 'powers', 'heart', 'had', 'been', 'weakened', 'ever', 'was', 'accumlination', 'problem', 'Finally', 'reason', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'talk', 'Clana', 'relationship', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'important', 'everything', 'else', 'going', 'season', 'will', 'discuss', 'season', 'six', 'review', 'Smallville', 'season', 'felt', 'tacked']",Smallville: Season 5
998590,AP3B615GM191G,B000G1R4SO,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","In the previous season, Smallville lacked the emotional dramatic punch that had created such enjoyable characters.  Also, with the characters graduating at the end of the season, it was clear that the show was in for a major change of pace.  While this fifth season did not always hit the jackpot in that area, it by and large was extremely successful in moving the show in a new direction.As the season progressed, the focus perceptively shifted from the Clark/Lana/Chloe relationship triangle to the ""comic book geek"" aspect of the Superman mythology.  Let's first look at what failed during this season, then examine the many things that went right:The most noticeable failure of Season Five was the episode ""Thirst"" (where Lana joins a college sorority and becomes a vampire), widely regarded as the worst episode in the show's history.  Also, a conscious effort to raise the gratuitous sex appeal in the show is seen, what with Lois Lane's ""patriotic"" striptease in ""Exposed"" and the episode entitled ""Hypnotic"", which focuses on Clark's sexual relationship with a meteor freak.  Though I understand that ""sex sells"" (especially to Smallville's teenage audience), those types of relationships also serve to undermine the engaging relationships of Smallville's past.Besides the single clinker and amped-up sex appeal, this season had a wide variety of bright spots:-Clark and Lana are finally able to have a normal relationship at the beginning of the season (sadly, it would be the last time that relationship carried with it any emotional punch).-Two more characters (one ""mechanical"" and one ""amphibious"") are introduced who are vital to Clark's future.-Lex is shown what his life could be like if he chooses to soften his heart.-The Senate race between Jonathan Kent and Lex Luthor heats up, culminating in the show's 100th episode, ""Reckoning"", which will bring a tear to even the most cynical of viewers.-The introduction of a Lex/Lana relationship, which contains many intriguing facets.-Finally, the introduction of Professor Fine, a heralded villain from the Superman cannon who unleashes the most terrible evil in Kryptonian history.Overall, Smallville's fifth season was an action-packed ride from beginning to end.  Though sacrificing many of the show's core characters/relationships in favor of sex appeal, the show was able to successful morph itself from teen-drama to science fiction (for better or worse, depending on who you are).
