728091,ANYN9CB8ADGID,B00007G1W2,Brandon Stevens,"[6, 6]","Some of the material on this DVD was funny, but not as funny as Don't Try This At Home The Steve-O Video Vol. 1. This one sonded more shocking so I bought it and I was a little creeped out about how Steve-O sets a girl's [chest] on fire(That wasn't funny at all). It still gives me the creeps. And how a guy gets the [stuff] beatin out of him with a skateboard. They show a warning before viewing it and That was not funny what so ever as well as this guy taking the most nastiest [pooh] ever. It goes all over the bathroom stalls. It's not really something to look forward to. I did however like 3/4 of it though. So if you like shocking/supposedly funny stuff then check this one out! Some of the stuff was stupid I had to laugh, but if Steve-O comes out with a Vol. 3 I would most certainly buy that too because it seems he puts the nastiest material on Vol.2 and it just makes since that if a Vol.3 came out. It would be even worse! But I do give him credit!",3,Shocking!

It lacks the comedy of Jackass and what stunts it does have are just not funny.  In one scene Steve-o sets a girls chest on fire, I don't find that funny, it's kind of weird.Am a big fan of the jackass series and I bought this thinking it would be just as good, but it's a poor mans attempt at humour.  Mostly Steve-o is out of his head on drugs and it shows alot.

I thought that this DVD was going to be of him and the others doing stunts like on jackass but I was wrong.  This just has naked people in it and it isn't funny at all.  I was very disappointed.

Featuring Jackasses Wee Man, Ryan Dunn, Bam Margera, Preston Lacey and skaters like Ryan Simonetti and Preston Acuff. This has more stunts than the first and is guaranteed to shock you. This video also has tons of behind the scenes footage and more girls. Tune in to see: Ti*s on fire, Trash Cans, Steve-O's eviction party, more skating, rental vans being destroyed, lighting nuts on fire, breaking mircrowaves, the fireball stunt, and many more.

But this goes a little too far in some cases,I just don't like it when people mess with their own excrement!I like the raw stuff on these videos, I find puking, fighting and all the stunts hilarious, but the [crapping]part is a real turn off.There is one scene where Steve-O puts his hand down a toilet and pulls out something he's just 'done', and the final scene in the DVD has one man doing the worst [crap] ever caught on celluloid, now I just didn't fid it amusing, more sickening.The whole point of the dvd is the tour, but it hardly shows any of the tour, more footage of everybody backstage, I thought the whole DVD would be devoted to the on stage antics.There is one scene which has to have a warning which comes up on the screen, it's a bit nasty, and not for everyone, all in all I enjoyed this, but it is not quite CKY, which remains the best in my opinion.After watching this I don't think I'd like to knock about with Steve-O and his crew, just for the sake I don't want to be shat on!!!",3,Funny Stuff.....but goes a bit too far!,1041552000,"01 3, 2003",2003,1136,"['like', 'whole', 'Jackass', 'CKY', 'Steve-O', 'thing', 'appreciate', 'need', 'improve', 'material', 'go', 'more', 'extreme', 'time', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'cases', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'people', 'mess', 'own', 'excrement', 'raw', 'stuff', 'videos', 'find', 'puking', 'fighting', 'stunts', 'hilarious', '[', 'crapping', ']', 'part', 'real', 'turn', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Steve-O', 'hand', 'down', 'toilet', 'out', 'something', 'just', ""'done"", 'final', 'scene', 'DVD', 'one', 'man', 'doing', 'worst', '[', 'crap', ']', 'ever', 'caught', 'celluloid', 'now', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fid', 'amusing', 'more', 'sickening.The', 'whole', 'point', 'dvd', 'tour', 'hardly', 'tour', 'more', 'footage', 'everybody', 'backstage', 'thought', 'whole', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'devoted', 'stage', 'one', 'scene', 'have', 'warning', 'up', 'screen', 'bit', 'nasty', 'not', 'everyone', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'quite', 'CKY', 'best', 'opinion.After', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'like', 'knock', 'Steve-O', 'crew', 'just', 'sake', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'shat']",N/A

I do admit that this one isn't as good at the others, mainly because there just wasn't as much as the others. No special features with additional footage, and the actual run time of the video is only like an hour if I remember correctly.Even though Vol. 2 isn't as good as the others, it still is really funny, just not as long.
