What is confusing--mixture of Chinese, Japanese and Taiwanian names--all of it very local but probably important and at the same time it shows an existing conflicts beyond private lives. These conflicts more likely will be driving force in future again.Of course main character is freaking excellent and realistic and producer shows he knows life as is.

Looking gritty, dark, and foreboding, Kaneshiro pulls all the strings in this multi-tiered crime-drama. Only an actor as versatile and talented as Kaneshiro could have made this movie work, and he does. The twists and turns can be confusing if you cannot keep track of all the characters involved in the various mob factions, but if you can follow the story, it really will make sense. The cinematography is exquisite, and each scene is beautifully crafted. And, of course, if you are in love with Takeshi Kaneshiro, well...suffice it to know that he is in almost every scene, looking impossibly gorgeous.",5,A MUST-SEE IF YOU ARE A KANESHIRO FAN,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,722,"['movie', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'trend', 'picking', 'roles', 'are', 'nuanced', 'complicated', 'mesmerizing', 'Looking', 'gritty', 'dark', 'foreboding', 'Kaneshiro', 'strings', 'multi-tiered', 'crime-drama', 'Only', 'actor', 'versatile', 'talented', 'Kaneshiro', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'work', 'twists', 'turns', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'track', 'characters', 'involved', 'various', 'mob', 'factions', 'can', 'follow', 'story', 'really', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'cinematography', 'exquisite', 'scene', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'course', 'are', 'love', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'well', 'suffice', 'know', 'almost', 'scene', 'looking', 'impossibly', 'gorgeous']",N/A

508726,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B00000JZJ9,Ernest Jagger,"[4, 5]","""Sleepless Town,"" is a very gritty and terrific crime-drama film. I have really liked everything by Takeshi Kaneshiro. Although I have not seen all of his work, he definitely has the talent and charisma to go a long, long way in the world of cinema. This film riveted me and pulled me in from the start. It is an absolute must watch. The film takes place in an area of Japan named Kabukichio. It is a place where there are different races and languages spoken. A place where hegemony over the area is in the hands of the crime bosses. But in order to keep control, without the different factions facing off in a war, truces are established, and lines are not to be crossed.Here we find the main protagonist, Kenichi, played aptly by (Takeshi Kaneshiro). Kenichi walks a very fragile line. He is half Japanese, and half Chinese. And although he himself is a dealer of stolen goods, and knows the rules, he must walk an even more delicate line thanks in part to his former business partner Fu-chun, who killed the right-hand man of the don of the Shanghai mafia. There are no loyalties in this crime-drama. Fu-chun, who has left town after causing this mess mysteriously returns. Why? What is his purpose?Suddenly, another intriguing character jumps into the plot. A mysterious woman named Natsumi Sato, played by (Mirai Yamamoto) Kenichi falls in love with her, and she with him. However, she will lie, cheat and steal--anything to further herself. Therefore, can Kenichi still trust her? But there is more to her and the crime lords that Kenichi has to deal with. Meanwhile, his former business partner Fu-chun wants something. What is it? This film gets more intriguing and mysterious as it moves along. I do not want to spoil this film for you, but the ending has a terrific twist. Or should I say, several twists. A must see.",5,An Absolutely Terrific Film: Takeshi Kaneshiro Shines,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,1828,"['Sleepless', 'Town', 'very', 'gritty', 'terrific', 'crime-drama', 'film', 'have', 'really', 'liked', 'everything', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'work', 'definitely', 'talent', 'charisma', 'go', 'long', 'long', 'way', 'world', 'cinema', 'film', 'riveted', 'pulled', 'start', 'absolute', 'must', 'watch', 'film', 'place', 'area', 'Japan', 'named', 'Kabukichio', 'place', 'where', 'are', 'different', 'races', 'spoken', 'place', 'where', 'hegemony', 'area', 'hands', 'crime', 'bosses', 'order', 'keep', 'control', 'different', 'factions', 'facing', 'off', 'war', 'truces', 'are', 'established', 'lines', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'crossed.Here', 'find', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Kenichi', 'played', 'aptly', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'Kenichi', 'very', 'fragile', 'line', 'half', 'Japanese', 'half', 'Chinese', 'dealer', 'stolen', 'goods', 'rules', 'must', 'walk', 'even', 'more', 'delicate', 'line', 'thanks', 'part', 'former', 'business', 'partner', 'Fu-chun', 'who', 'killed', 'right-hand', 'man', 'don', 'Shanghai', 'mafia', 'are', 'loyalties', 'crime-drama', 'Fu-chun', 'who', 'left', 'town', 'causing', 'mess', 'mysteriously', 'returns', 'Why', 'What', 'purpose', 'Suddenly', 'intriguing', 'character', 'jumps', 'plot', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'named', 'Natsumi', 'Sato', 'played', 'Mirai', 'Yamamoto', 'Kenichi', 'love', 'However', 'will', 'lie', 'cheat', 'steal', 'anything', 'further', 'Therefore', 'can', 'Kenichi', 'still', 'more', 'crime', 'lords', 'Kenichi', 'deal', 'Meanwhile', 'former', 'business', 'partner', 'Fu-chun', 'something', 'What', 'film', 'more', 'intriguing', 'mysterious', 'along', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'spoil', 'film', 'ending', 'terrific', 'twist', 'should', 'say', 'several', 'twists', 'must', 'see']",N/A
508727,A2IYRRHZMF49L1,B00000JZJ9,J  Tate,"[0, 0]","This was a good film and I enjoyed watching it. Takeshi Kaneshiro really shines in the lead role as a stolen goods dealer in the red light district called Kabukicho in Tokyo. I must admit I had a little trouble keeping all the mobsters straight as to which name went with which guy. I also did not feel a lot of chemistry between Takeshi and the lead female actress. It was more a lust relationship between them than anything loving although Takeshi's character did seem to show some caring for her. The movie is basically about betrayal, sex, power, lies, plots, revenge, mob territory and murder. What made it different from other movies of the mob genre is the interesting,if somewhat claustrophobic, area in which it was shot, that it dealt somewhat with how the Japanese feel about other Asian people living in Japan and that most of the filming is gritty, dark, artsy and gives an overall feeling of being oppressive.

For me he can do no wrong, with that said, I love this movie.  Even though I saw it with no subtitles and it was not dubbed, and I  absolutely did not understand half of it, Takeshi was positively GORGEOUS!  At this time his popularity was growing in Japan so, I think that this  movie beautifully promoted him there.  I also recognized alot of the  Chinese actors and the the lead chinese woman was beautiful too ( happy  guys?).  I want to see this with subtitles so I can better understand the  plot, but I could watch it over and over again just for Takeshi.  Sorry I  hope this helps.

He's easily got to be one of the most beautiful men in the entire world. A negative aspect about this film that I have to address is the female lead he gets involved with. Her character is so annoying, all over him all the time. For those of you who think that's just my jealousy talking, I'll have you know that I'm ok with some of his other on-screen relationships.
