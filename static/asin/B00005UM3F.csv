684513,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005UM3F,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","This film is based on the 1989 explosion on the USS Iowa. It starts by showing the background of the sailors who served on that ship. They want to set a long-range record with a live shoot on their 45-year old battleship. The competition is between 16-inch guns and new guided missiles in long-range targetting. A master chief wants to use five bags of propellant, another advises against this since this powder is not advised for heavy projectiles (burn rate?). [There is a reason for standards in industry.]There is a problem with a misfire in turret 2, so they reload. There is friction when they try, and then an explosion! Everyone inside is killed, and a fire results. The survivors are treated, action is taken to prevent an explosion by flooding the turret. Afterwards, the clean-up removes things that could be needed for the investigation.An ""informal investigation"" begins, but it seems like the brass wants a cover-up. A lieutenant answers questions and tells too much. The brass would like to believe it was sabotage, not the result of a mistake. The captain suggests the problem is due to personnel, not a mechanical problem. The NIS investigates the victims, not the system! The powder was made in the 1940s and was improperly stored.Does the story about Hartwig remind you of ""The Running Man"" or some other work of fiction? At the hearing the Captain refuses to place the blame on a dead gunner's mate. He retired from the Navy in 1991. The battleship Iowa was decommissioned.The impression that I received is that it was due to many faults. The emphasis on new technology meant short funds for old technology. Fewer men than requested, deferred maintenance, resulted in an accident waiting to happen. The need for battleships is to provide slots for officers and rankings, and a market for the businesses that supply the armed forces. This is probably how it works in other countries too.This is a good story, but being reality-based means limits on the dramatic action. Does it remind you of corporate politics?",4,Dramatic Recreation of the Tragedy,1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,2030,"['film', 'based', '1989', 'explosion', 'USS', 'Iowa', 'showing', 'background', 'sailors', 'who', 'served', 'ship', 'want', 'set', 'long-range', 'record', 'live', 'shoot', '45-year', 'old', 'battleship', 'competition', '16-inch', 'guns', 'new', 'guided', 'missiles', 'long-range', 'targetting', 'master', 'chief', 'use', 'five', 'bags', 'propellant', 'powder', 'not', 'advised', 'heavy', 'projectiles', 'burn', 'rate', '[', 'reason', 'standards', 'industry', 'problem', 'misfire', 'turret', '2', 'reload', 'friction', 'when', 'try', 'then', 'explosion', 'Everyone', 'inside', 'killed', 'fire', 'results', 'survivors', 'are', 'treated', 'action', 'taken', 'prevent', 'explosion', 'flooding', 'turret', 'Afterwards', 'clean-up', 'removes', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'needed', 'investigation.An', 'informal', 'investigation', 'begins', 'brass', 'cover-up', 'lieutenant', 'answers', 'questions', 'tells', 'too', 'much', 'brass', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'was', 'sabotage', 'not', 'result', 'mistake', 'captain', 'problem', 'due', 'personnel', 'not', 'mechanical', 'problem', 'NIS', 'victims', 'not', 'system', 'powder', 'was', 'made', '1940s', 'was', 'improperly', 'story', 'Hartwig', 'remind', 'Running', 'Man', 'other', 'work', 'fiction', 'hearing', 'Captain', 'place', 'blame', 'dead', 'gunner', 'mate', 'retired', 'Navy', '1991', 'battleship', 'Iowa', 'was', 'decommissioned.The', 'impression', 'received', 'was', 'due', 'many', 'faults', 'emphasis', 'new', 'technology', 'meant', 'short', 'funds', 'old', 'technology', 'Fewer', 'men', 'requested', 'deferred', 'maintenance', 'resulted', 'accident', 'waiting', 'happen', 'need', 'battleships', 'provide', 'slots', 'officers', 'rankings', 'market', 'businesses', 'supply', 'armed', 'forces', 'probably', 'how', 'other', 'countries', 'too.This', 'good', 'story', 'being', 'reality-based', 'means', 'limits', 'dramatic', 'action', 'remind', 'corporate', 'politics']",N/A

As a SCPO with 32 years of service, trained as seaman (slight) on 16 inch guns, the explanation portrayed is extremely flawed.  There are many Hollywood errors that could have been eliminated with a naval adviser to the film.  If there was one, Hollywood certainly didn't pay attention:  improper portrayal of the chain-of-command, Turret One officer (OIC) is referred to as Ensign and JG, he is also referred to as OIC Turret One and at times Turret 2, uniforms are improperly worn, master chief is referred to as  ""one of my officers"" by the captain, officers and enlisted are referred to as not drinking together and yet ashore they are, master chief is depicted as asking a JG for permission which he would not have done, but rather advised a junior officer who was NOT in his chain of command, suggestion that an O6 can't play golf with an admiral when they certainly can, as other reviews have indicated sailors are NOT soldiers, XO is represented as a Lt Commander when on a large draft ship (battleship) the XO would have been at least a full commander, inference that CO did not know of the Master Chiefs gunnery practices which would never happen as the CO would be aware any time a salvo was ordered which would have been scheduled and briefed by the Weapons/Gunnery Officer, confusion for non-navy types concerning NIS (NIS was correct in 1989, but became NCIS in 1992 which would be more familiar with most civilians, the inference by the Captain that the ""body was found one story down: could never happen as it would be ""one deck down or below"", when they go to re-certify the guns the firing order is given for turret One and yet the movie shows the defective turret Two as firing, and finally, in 1989 if a sailor was even thought to be gay he would not be transferred to another ship but would have received a discharge for ""convenience of the Navy.""

We know that an explosion occurred in gun turret number 2 that killed 47 members of the crew.  This was a catastrophe for the Navy and the ship's Captain Fred Moosally.  The NCIS made a rushed attempt at an investigation and wrongly accused a gunner's mate of being a distraught gay man who sabatoged the ship due to relationship troubles.The movie has good acting with James Caan and Daniel Roebuck's parts being especially memorable.  The budget wasn't huge but there aren't any parts that drag.  Some of the dialogue is a little melodramatic (especially from the investigators), but given the sensationalistic nature of the allegations maybe it is believable.

A tragic explosion on a test shoot claims the lives of 47 crew members and opens an investigation into the tragedy.  Was it faulty equipment, poorly maintained ammunition, or as the NSI concludes, the murder/suicide of a supposedly homosexual gunner who wanted revenge on his lover?

684519,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00005UM3F,Nicholas Carroll,"[8, 8]","Its obvious from watching this film that its a lower budget, made-for-cable movie that isn't bad, though could always stand to be better.  Being a Navy veteran, I really appreciated seeing shipboard life on screen and how damage control drills are conducted.  Unfortunately, most of the film depends upon the investigation into the explosion on the USS Iowa and that lacks suspense for the most part.  Viewers don't feel the tension as they should, which a film like ""Crimson Tide"" was good at creating.  That's probably due to the fact that this was a film with a lower budget and made for a cable station like TNT or something (instead of the higher quality HBO).The biggest cringe-inducing moment for me was hearing the CO (James Caan) of the ship refer to people as ""soldiers"".  In my five year enlistment, I've never heard anyone in the Navy refer to sailors and officers as ""soldiers"".  The Navy looks down on the Army, and to call sailors that is not only degrading, but grossly inaccurate.  If the producers of this film can't tell the difference between ""soldiers"" and ""sailors"", they shouldn't be making a movie about the Navy to begin with.I thought it was interesting, the portrayal of NIS as being obsessed with finding homosexuals and blaming them for whatever goes wrong.  That much seems accurate, and if people wonder why the Navy wanted to scapegoat its dead sailors, the film makes it clear.  Careers are at stake, and there's nothing worse for an ambitious Commanding Officer who wishes to join the Admiral ranks than for something of that magnitude to happen on his ship.  There is a law in the Navy that the CO goes down with his ship, accountability flows to the top.  We've seen this most recently with the CO of the USS Greeneville--the submarine that surfaced right beneath a Japanese fishing boat in 2001.  He couldn't deflect blame onto the lower ranks, because being CO means you take full responsibility.This film was too short for my liking, as I would have enjoyed about 30 minutes more, if they added more tension into the screenplay.  Most of the performances are one-dimensional and we only get brief hints at a friendship between two sailors that NIS thinks is gay, but viewers don't have enough scenes to make a decision either way.  The dramatic moment for this film rests on whether the CO would agree with NIS' report blaming a dead sailor for the deed or would he stick out for his crew and admit that the real cause was accidental.  After that ""dramatic conclusion"", the film wraps up pretty quickly, as the idealistic officer (played by former ""Dead Poet"" Robert Sean Leonard) is transferred off the ship.  Like I said above, there could have been more scenes to heighten the tension, because this situation had real repercussions for the Navy at large.  I believe the USS Iowa explosion is considered the most tragic and deadliest accident in our Navy's 230 year history, so there should have been more to this movie.  All in all, its not bad...for a low budget, made-for-cable film.  Still, a part of me would have liked to have seen what Hollywood could have done with a larger budget and a longer film with more tension throughout.  I guess I'll have to just read the book to learn more.",4,A Glimpse of a Navy-created hell,1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,3234,"['obvious', 'watching', 'film', 'lower', 'budget', 'made-for-cable', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'though', 'could', 'always', 'stand', 'be', 'better', 'Being', 'Navy', 'veteran', 'really', 'appreciated', 'seeing', 'shipboard', 'life', 'screen', 'how', 'damage', 'control', 'drills', 'are', 'conducted', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'film', 'investigation', 'explosion', 'USS', 'Iowa', 'suspense', 'most', 'part', 'Viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'tension', 'should', 'film', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'was', 'good', 'creating', 'probably', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'film', 'lower', 'budget', 'made', 'cable', 'station', 'TNT', 'something', 'instead', 'higher', 'quality', 'HBO', '.The', 'biggest', 'cringe-inducing', 'moment', 'was', 'hearing', 'CO', 'James', 'Caan', 'ship', 'refer', 'people', 'soldiers', 'five', 'year', 'enlistment', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'anyone', 'Navy', 'refer', 'sailors', 'officers', 'soldiers', 'Navy', 'down', 'Army', 'call', 'sailors', 'not', 'only', 'degrading', 'grossly', 'inaccurate', 'producers', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'difference', 'soldiers', 'sailors', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'making', 'movie', 'Navy', 'begin', 'with.I', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'NIS', 'being', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'homosexuals', 'blaming', 'whatever', 'wrong', 'much', 'accurate', 'people', 'wonder', 'why', 'Navy', 'wanted', 'scapegoat', 'dead', 'sailors', 'film', 'clear', 'Careers', 'are', 'stake', 'nothing', 'worse', 'ambitious', 'Commanding', 'Officer', 'who', 'join', 'Admiral', 'ranks', 'something', 'magnitude', 'happen', 'ship', 'law', 'Navy', 'CO', 'down', 'ship', 'accountability', 'top', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'recently', 'CO', 'USS', 'Greeneville', 'submarine', 'surfaced', 'right', 'beneath', 'Japanese', 'fishing', 'boat', '2001', 'could', ""n't"", 'deflect', 'blame', 'lower', 'ranks', 'being', 'CO', 'take', 'full', 'responsibility.This', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'liking', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', '30', 'minutes', 'more', 'added', 'more', 'tension', 'screenplay', 'Most', 'performances', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'only', 'get', 'brief', 'hints', 'friendship', 'two', 'sailors', 'NIS', 'gay', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'scenes', 'make', 'decision', 'way', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'film', 'CO', 'would', 'agree', 'NIS', 'report', 'blaming', 'dead', 'sailor', 'deed', 'would', 'stick', 'out', 'crew', 'admit', 'real', 'cause', 'was', 'accidental', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'film', 'up', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'idealistic', 'officer', 'played', 'former', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'transferred', 'off', 'ship', 'said', 'above', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'scenes', 'heighten', 'tension', 'situation', 'had', 'real', 'repercussions', 'Navy', 'large', 'believe', 'USS', 'Iowa', 'explosion', 'considered', 'most', 'tragic', 'deadliest', 'accident', 'Navy', '230', 'year', 'history', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'low', 'budget', 'made-for-cable', 'film', 'Still', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'larger', 'budget', 'longer', 'film', 'more', 'tension', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'just', 'read', 'book', 'learn', 'more']",N/A
