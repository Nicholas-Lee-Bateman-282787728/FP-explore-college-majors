1616478,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00ARRQ9NI,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","There are times when it's nice to just put a movie into the DVD player and know from looking at the box art just what to expect. Simple action films are the best of these. There is little doubt in your mind that you're about to witness Shakespeare. No, you're going to watch a plot line delivered and set up and then about 80 minutes of butt kicking action. This film is that and nothing more but then it doesn't need to be.This latest in the line of feature films from WWE of course stars one of its wrestlers, this time Mike ""The Miz"" Mizanin as Sergeant Jake Carter. As he explains in voice over he and his sisters were left behind when their parents died and he took off to join the Marines. Part of a special ops unit, he's been trained to be a killing machine from the start. His sisters, on the other hand, stayed in the home they grew up in and have become part of their home town.Mike returns for a visit and has to adjust to a few changes. For one, his best friend is now a Deputy Sheriff in town. Another is that the older of his two sisters Amanda is dating him. And lastly his little sister Lilly is dating a young guy who was always someone in trouble that Mike isn't happy about. But he's trying to deal with it even though it leads to a small confrontation.Later in the film Lilly and her boyfriend are working on his car near the river (why they chose here I have no idea) when they witness a group of home grown terrorists murder a man before their eyes as a weapons buy goes bad. They are captured quickly and taken hostage. Before being captured Lilly was able to let Amanda know what was going on. Now Mike sets out to rescue his sister.But things become complicated when it turns out the FBI has been watching this group all along. It turns out the leader is a college professor turned extremist (Neal McDonough) who has made plans to blow something up. Just what they haven't discovered yet, but the bombing is supposed to go down today. Now they want Mike to stand back and let them handle things. Come on, this is an action movie; we know up front that they'll screw it up some way.Of course they do and that's when Mike has to take things into his own hands. Trained in counter terrorism techniques, he sets out to take out the bad guy and rescue Lilly in the process. Along the way he ends up getting help from her boyfriend who turns out to be a good kid after all.  The end result is pretty much telegraphed ahead of time since this is a by the book flick but it's satisfying as well.There is no outstanding achievement in acting here but the movie wasn't made as a showcase for that. What we have is some solid acting by a cast that knows exactly what kind of movie they're making. But that doesn't stop them from doing their best and coming off quite nicely. Most importantly is the acting ability of Mizanin. He does a fine job here and shows the potential to be not just an action star but a decent actor as well. Let's hope he gets the chance to prove that.Like I said from the start, the movie is predictable and offers nothing new to the genre. Then again it never intended to. It was just intended to be another WWE vehicle to make one of their stars a movie star and to offer solid action entertainment for fans of the genre. The fact is they deliver on all counts.",3,EXPECTED ACTION,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,3303,"['are', 'times', 'when', 'nice', 'just', 'put', 'movie', 'DVD', 'player', 'know', 'looking', 'box', 'art', 'just', 'what', 'expect', 'Simple', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'best', 'little', 'doubt', 'mind', ""'re"", 'witness', 'Shakespeare', 'No', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'plot', 'line', 'delivered', 'set', 'up', 'then', '80', 'minutes', 'butt', 'kicking', 'action', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', ""n't"", 'need', 'be.This', 'latest', 'line', 'feature', 'films', 'WWE', 'course', 'stars', 'one', 'wrestlers', 'time', 'Mike', 'Miz', 'Mizanin', 'Sergeant', 'Jake', 'Carter', 'voice', 'sisters', 'were', 'left', 'when', 'parents', 'died', 'took', 'off', 'join', 'Marines', 'Part', 'special', 'ops', 'unit', 'been', 'trained', 'be', 'killing', 'machine', 'start', 'sisters', 'other', 'hand', 'stayed', 'home', 'grew', 'up', 'have', 'become', 'part', 'home', 'returns', 'visit', 'adjust', 'few', 'changes', 'one', 'best', 'friend', 'now', 'Deputy', 'Sheriff', 'town', 'older', 'two', 'sisters', 'Amanda', 'dating', 'lastly', 'little', 'sister', 'Lilly', 'dating', 'young', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'someone', 'trouble', 'Mike', ""n't"", 'happy', 'trying', 'deal', 'even', 'small', 'confrontation.Later', 'film', 'Lilly', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'working', 'car', 'river', 'why', 'chose', 'here', 'have', 'idea', 'when', 'witness', 'group', 'home', 'grown', 'terrorists', 'murder', 'man', 'eyes', 'weapons', 'buy', 'bad', 'are', 'captured', 'quickly', 'taken', 'hostage', 'being', 'captured', 'Lilly', 'was', 'able', 'let', 'Amanda', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Now', 'Mike', 'out', 'rescue', 'sister.But', 'things', 'become', 'complicated', 'when', 'out', 'FBI', 'been', 'watching', 'group', 'along', 'out', 'leader', 'college', 'professor', 'turned', 'extremist', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'who', 'made', 'plans', 'blow', 'something', 'up', 'Just', 'what', 'have', ""n't"", 'discovered', 'yet', 'bombing', 'supposed', 'go', 'down', 'today', 'Now', 'want', 'Mike', 'stand', 'back', 'let', 'handle', 'things', 'Come', 'action', 'movie', 'know', 'up', 'front', ""'ll"", 'screw', 'up', 'way.Of', 'course', 'do', 'when', 'Mike', 'take', 'things', 'own', 'hands', 'Trained', 'counter', 'terrorism', 'techniques', 'out', 'take', 'out', 'bad', 'guy', 'rescue', 'Lilly', 'process', 'way', 'up', 'getting', 'help', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'kid', 'end', 'result', 'pretty', 'much', 'telegraphed', 'ahead', 'time', 'book', 'flick', 'satisfying', 'outstanding', 'achievement', 'acting', 'here', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'showcase', 'What', 'have', 'solid', 'acting', 'cast', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', ""'re"", 'making', ""n't"", 'stop', 'doing', 'best', 'coming', 'off', 'quite', 'nicely', 'Most', 'importantly', 'acting', 'ability', 'Mizanin', 'fine', 'job', 'here', 'potential', 'be', 'not', 'just', 'action', 'star', 'decent', 'actor', 'well', 'Let', 'hope', 'chance', 'prove', 'that.Like', 'said', 'start', 'movie', 'predictable', 'nothing', 'new', 'genre', 'Then', 'again', 'never', 'intended', 'was', 'just', 'intended', 'be', 'WWE', 'vehicle', 'make', 'one', 'stars', 'movie', 'star', 'offer', 'solid', 'action', 'entertainment', 'fans', 'genre', 'fact', 'deliver', 'counts']",The Marine 3: Homefront

Lead actors in this series take second place to my absolute adoration of action movie high-octane scenes. Running, jumping, shooting, things exploding everywhere! Mindless, senseless, wanton destruction! Now that's what makes an action movie!Come now, don't tell me that you actually enjoy Arnold's acting! The man has four facial expressions: Stone Face, Gleeful I'll Kick Your Ass Face, Crazy Face and Fake Fear Face. His voice has never changed tone or inflection, it's just loud and louder. He has the range of of a broken-necked guitar. We love the BOOM!One thing about Mike Mizanin, he's got some talent. He IS in the WWE, and every Superstar/Diva is an actor/actress. Ted DiBiase and John Cena are reasonably talented as well; they don't bore me like Arnold does. I love the WWE enough to watch the Monday and Friday shows regularly, I even like the OTHER wrestling company enough to watch it sometimes.The love of action movies is mostly about the love of the adrenaline rush.

1616486,AZXHK8IO25FL6,B00ARRQ9NI,ribcage,"[1, 2]","The Marine 3, obviously, is now the 3rd in its series. By this point, you should know what to expect. The first two flicks were religiously devout to adhering to action movie formulas, and the third is certainly no exception. It's still about a tough guy coming home from a tour of duty, not being able to cope with the life he's left behind, and stumbling head-on into a hyper-violent situation with cardboard villains (and yes, cardboard heroes) and tons of ADHD action.From that, it's easy to know if this will be up your alley. So really, the only points to discuss are the flow of this action, since story and characters are completely sidelined, and how it fits into the series.Each new entry is a new wrestler playing a new character. I will say that Miz was a lot more convincing as an actor than Cena or Dibiase. No one's going to be honoring him with any awards for his work, but I didn't have to cringe at any of his delivery.The action turns out pretty well in this one. It's clearly inspired by a lot of other action movies (Under Siege and Heat stand out in my mind), but that's par for the course in direct-to-video fare. Fortunately, the direction keeps these scenes from feeling too much like a poor man's version of its blockbuster inspirations.Action-wise, everything works, but nothing stands out as truly memorable.As far as fitting into the series, if you're expecting something slightly different as new crews tackle the concept, you'll be satisfied with this take. The first was certainly very goofy, and this one is more serious like Marine 2, but Marine 3 handles it much better, and looks a whole lot slicker than the previous entry. Miz's character is made to be single, rescuing a sister rather than his girl, which excises a lot of the awkward development of a romantic couple that wasn't written or acted well in the first two entries.Overall, it fits well into the series, so fans of the first two should enjoy it. Direct-to-video action fans will probably enjoy it more than Marine 2 as well.
