No need for me to write volumes about the brilliance of Ford and his films. The more times I see them,  the more I marvel at the quality and fully understand why he is a filmmaking legend.  This collection contains genuine classics: The Grapes of Wrath, How Green Was My Valley and My Darling Clementine.  Also the rather unsung but very good Drums Along the Mohawk and the terrific Nick Redman documentary Becoming John Ford which includes his wartime documentaries. There's lot of fascinating extras including extensive audio commentaries on all the features by such Ford experts as Joseph McBride, Scott Eyman, Redman and Julie Kirgo, The excellent Daryl F. Zanuck: 20th.Century Filmmaker biography is also in this collection.  Added is a bonus disc Frontier Marshall, directed by Allan Dwan, an inspiration for Ford's later &#34;Clementine&#34;.

1110324,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B000WMA6HS,Douglas M,"[16, 17]","Sifting through the various packages which are available on DVD of John Ford's filmaking at 20th Century Fox, this set is probably the one which offers the most reliable entertainment, the highest standard of films and the best value. It is worth noting that all of the films, with the exception of ""Frontier Marshall"" (not a Ford film), represent Ford at his best while he worked within the constraints of the studio system (not necessarily a bad thing) and in collaboration with Darryl F. Zanuck, the studio head and as strong minded as Ford. All of the films have extensive and informative reviews under their individual titles, so here a few random comments:- ""Frontier Marshall"", a B grade western directed by Alan Dwan, is a precursor to ""My Darling Clementine"". It demonstrates the difference between an assembly line western with a tight budget and the achievements of Ford with a much bigger budget and a much better cast for the lyrical ""My Darling Clementine"". Everything about the latter is superior, possible with the exception of an amusing Binnie Barnes in the part modified for Linda Darnell which Darnell played so artificially.- Ford preferred not to work with conventional stars and Claudette Colbert undermines ""Drums along the Mohawk"". While she acts the part, she never looks the part. With her reputation for vanity, the false eyelashes etc are absurd.- ""How Green was My Valley"" contains a really good commentary with geriatric Anna Lee, one of the stars of the film, adding her comments.All of the prints are in great condition and the documentaries provide invaluable information about the films, the studio and Zanuck. The dud of the set, if you discount ""Frontier Marshall"", is the documentary, ""Becoming John Ford"", a prototype of pretentious and tedious film making. You will learn much more about Ford himself by watching the documentary attached to ""How Green was My Valley"" in which Roddy McDowell, Maureen O'Hara and Anna Lee appear or listening to the very detailed commentary on ""My Darling Clementine"".  This disk also contains a pre-release cut of the film and the differences are carefully analysed. It gives a rare opportunity to understand how Zanuck could use his editorial skills to enhance a narrative.",5,Probably the best package of Ford's Fox films,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,2246,"['Sifting', 'various', 'packages', 'are', 'available', 'DVD', 'John', 'Ford', 'filmaking', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'set', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'reliable', 'entertainment', 'highest', 'standard', 'films', 'best', 'value', 'worth', 'noting', 'films', 'exception', 'Frontier', 'Marshall', 'not', 'Ford', 'film', 'represent', 'Ford', 'best', 'worked', 'constraints', 'studio', 'system', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'collaboration', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'studio', 'head', 'strong', 'minded', 'Ford', 'films', 'have', 'extensive', 'informative', 'reviews', 'individual', 'titles', 'so', 'here', 'few', 'random', 'comments', 'Frontier', 'Marshall', 'B', 'grade', 'western', 'directed', 'Alan', 'Dwan', 'precursor', 'Darling', 'Clementine', 'difference', 'assembly', 'line', 'western', 'tight', 'budget', 'achievements', 'Ford', 'much', 'bigger', 'budget', 'much', 'better', 'cast', 'lyrical', 'Darling', 'Clementine', 'Everything', 'latter', 'superior', 'possible', 'exception', 'amusing', 'Binnie', 'Barnes', 'part', 'modified', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'Darnell', 'played', 'so', 'artificially.-', 'Ford', 'preferred', 'not', 'work', 'conventional', 'stars', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'part', 'never', 'part', 'reputation', 'vanity', 'false', 'eyelashes', 'etc', 'are', 'absurd.-', 'How', 'Green', 'was', 'Valley', 'really', 'good', 'commentary', 'geriatric', 'Anna', 'Lee', 'one', 'stars', 'film', 'adding', 'comments.All', 'prints', 'are', 'great', 'condition', 'documentaries', 'provide', 'invaluable', 'information', 'films', 'studio', 'Zanuck', 'dud', 'set', 'discount', 'Frontier', 'Marshall', 'documentary', 'Becoming', 'John', 'Ford', 'prototype', 'pretentious', 'tedious', 'film', 'making', 'will', 'learn', 'much', 'more', 'Ford', 'watching', 'documentary', 'attached', 'How', 'Green', 'was', 'Valley', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'Anna', 'Lee', 'appear', 'listening', 'very', 'detailed', 'commentary', 'Darling', 'Clementine', 'disk', 'also', 'pre-release', 'cut', 'film', 'differences', 'are', 'carefully', 'analysed', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'understand', 'how', 'Zanuck', 'could', 'use', 'editorial', 'skills', 'enhance', 'narrative']",The Essential John Ford: Ford At Fox Collection: (Frontier Marshal / My Darling Clementine / Drums Along the Mohawk / How Green Was My Valley / The Grapes of Wrath / Becoming John Ford)

1110330,A2ZHSORK1HHYTT,B000WMA6HS,Willy D. Reviewer,"[10, 16]","Buy the box set for ""Clementine"" and ""Grapes of Wrath"".  The other films are mediocre.  Ford and John Wayne (instead of Henry Fonda) make a better boxed set with their western triolgy plus ""Stagecoach"".  But, I did not hesitate to buy this set.  Here's what you get: ""Frontier Marshall"" with Randolf Scott is not Ford's best, nor does Scott stand out as Wyatt Earp.  It is a highly fictionalized part of Earp's life, which begs the question ""Why not film Earp according to the facts of his life?""  It looks like it was done by all concerned to fulfill studio contracts.  'My Darling Clementine"" is closer to the Earp saga (roughly 30% accurate).  Forgetting that it is about a fictional Wyatt Earp, the western itself is one of Ford's best, and Henry Fonda's best.  The cinematography is surperb, but the absence of multiple close-ups is notable, and regrettable. Also, Ford disagreed with the final cut.  Included in this box set are Ford's original film scenes without the additional music and added scenes -- you might agree that his version carries more impact.  ""Drums Along The Mohawk"" is rather boring, which is a surprise for a John Ford film, and the genre.  There is no build up to the indian battle scenes, therefore no excitement, no anticipation.  It is a routine melodrama about a married couple on the frontier.  Nothing special.  At any time during this film, you may feel free to get and go to the kitchen and order a pizza, without missing anything important in the film.  ""How Green Was My Valley"" is a standard John Ford drama. The critics have vacillated over the years with regard to the quality of this John Ford film.  It has never received a ""10"", at the most a ""7"" and with the passage of time, today a mediocre ""4"". ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" is a powerful film, both for Ford and Fonda.  Critics have claimed that Ford was pro-communist, or at least an extremely pink socialist.  The film definitely cries out for the workers of the world to unite.  As a depression era drama, it hits all bases to tear your heart out. The cinematography is matched only by ""Clementine"".  But in this film Ford paints graphic pictures with close-ups of every lead.  At times it is almost film noir. It is better casted than any other film in this boxed set.  This film is a definite ""10"" and has stood the passage of time to keep it in the top 100 films of all time.  It is said that Stalin's favorite American picture was ""Clementine"" and FDR's was ""Grapes Of Wrath"". It is recorded that both watched their Ford favorites over 20 times.  Perhaps FDR was inspired to formulate his ""New Deal"" after the 20th viewing.
