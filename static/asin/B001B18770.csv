Very rarely have I seen one that I can call absolutely moving but this one has definitely made that very short list. It says a lot to me that a self-proclaimed atheist could have such a turnaround and become a man of such faith.I won't rewrite the extensive reviews of others but I will say that this is a very well presented, non-preachy (if that's even a word) documentary. I also liked that it not only presented Lee Strobel, the man who found faith, it presented a man who was known for his faith who lost it so you see both sides.

1169793,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B001B18770,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[1, 1]","Lee Strobel is one of my favorite spiritual authors and I've read most of his books. In this DVD he presents two sides of a story. On one hand he interviews a man who has lost his faith. On the other he himself represents a man who has gained faith. It was interesting to see how he answered questions Charles Templeton struggled with. This DVD addresses questions like:How can God be loving if there is suffering, disease and death?Is there only one way to God?Is it OK to have doubts and still be a Christian?Why do the major religions of the world contradict each other?Which religion has the true answers to solve life's major dilemmas?Some of the answers will put your mind at ease. After watching this you will understand the source of evil. You will also understand that it is OK to have doubts.What I came away with was that compared with eternity with God, this life is fairly insignificant. The fact that we are strengthened by our troubles was also reinforced.I think if you feel uncertainty and confusion this might be one of the DVDs you are supposed to watch.While most of this DVD is beautifully done there are a few images that may be disturbing. Mostly they have to do with death. Probably nothing you haven't seen on the news.One thing you should not miss out on while watching this movie is the extra bonus documentaries. They are very touching and healing and encourage Christians to get more involved in solving the world's major problems.~The Rebecca Review",4,Is There Only One Way to God?,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,1479,"['Lee', 'Strobel', 'one', 'favorite', 'spiritual', 'authors', ""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'books', 'DVD', 'two', 'sides', 'story', 'one', 'hand', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'other', 'man', 'who', 'gained', 'faith', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'answered', 'questions', 'Charles', 'Templeton', 'struggled', 'DVD', 'questions', 'How', 'can', 'God', 'be', 'loving', 'suffering', 'disease', 'death', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'God', 'OK', 'have', 'doubts', 'still', 'be', 'Christian', 'Why', 'do', 'major', 'religions', 'world', 'contradict', 'other', 'Which', 'religion', 'true', 'answers', 'solve', 'life', 'major', 'dilemmas', 'answers', 'will', 'put', 'mind', 'ease', 'watching', 'will', 'understand', 'source', 'evil', 'will', 'also', 'understand', 'OK', 'have', 'doubts.What', 'came', 'away', 'was', 'compared', 'eternity', 'God', 'life', 'fairly', 'insignificant', 'fact', 'are', 'strengthened', 'troubles', 'was', 'also', 'reinforced.I', 'think', 'feel', 'uncertainty', 'confusion', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'DVDs', 'are', 'supposed', 'watch.While', 'most', 'DVD', 'beautifully', 'done', 'are', 'few', 'images', 'may', 'be', 'disturbing', 'Mostly', 'have', 'do', 'death', 'Probably', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'news.One', 'thing', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'out', 'watching', 'movie', 'extra', 'bonus', 'documentaries', 'are', 'very', 'touching', 'healing', 'encourage', 'Christians', 'get', 'more', 'involved', 'solving', 'world', 'major', 'problems.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']","Case For Faith, The"
1169794,A16QJ649N8PRV,B001B18770,S. Peek,"[1, 2]","Although it is only about an hour and twenty minutes long, 'The Case For Faith' DVD provides a powerful and effective response to two of the biggest objections to Christianity.  The main focus is answering the exclusiveness of Christianity (that Jesus is the only way to God) and the problem of evil and suffering (how a loving God could/would allow so much pain and misery to exist).This video is based upon the book of the same name by Lee Strobel.  In this, Strobel visits a lot with Charles Templeton who was a friend and former evangelist partner of Billy Graham several decades ago.  Mr. Templeton lost his Christian faith over the two objections listed above.  Mr. Strobel takes his complaints seriously and examines each.  During the course of this examination, he interviews several well known figures such as authors J.P. Moreland, Greg Koukl, and Joni Eareckson Tada and Biola professor Craig Hazen.Strobel gives viewers lots to ponder in this video.  It is well worth watching for Christians who want to be able to respond more effectively, seekers, and skeptics.  I also recommend Strobel's book by the same name,The Case for Faith: A Journalist Investigates the Toughest Objections to ChristianityandThe Case for Christ:  A Journalist's Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesusand its companion DVD,The Case for Christ.",5,Short But Powerful,1285113600,"09 22, 2010",2010,1341,"['only', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'long', 'Case', 'Faith', 'DVD', 'powerful', 'effective', 'response', 'two', 'biggest', 'objections', 'Christianity', 'main', 'focus', 'answering', 'exclusiveness', 'Christianity', 'Jesus', 'only', 'way', 'God', 'problem', 'evil', 'suffering', 'how', 'loving', 'God', 'allow', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'misery', 'exist', '.This', 'video', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Lee', 'Strobel', 'Strobel', 'lot', 'Charles', 'Templeton', 'who', 'was', 'friend', 'former', 'evangelist', 'partner', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'several', 'decades', 'ago', 'Mr.', 'Templeton', 'lost', 'Christian', 'faith', 'two', 'objections', 'listed', 'above', 'Mr.', 'Strobel', 'complaints', 'seriously', 'course', 'examination', 'several', 'well', 'known', 'figures', 'such', 'authors', 'J.P.', 'Moreland', 'Greg', 'Koukl', 'Joni', 'Eareckson', 'Tada', 'Biola', 'professor', 'Craig', 'Hazen.Strobel', 'viewers', 'lots', 'ponder', 'video', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Christians', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'respond', 'more', 'effectively', 'seekers', 'skeptics', 'also', 'recommend', 'Strobel', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Case', 'Faith', 'Journalist', 'Toughest', 'Objections', 'ChristianityandThe', 'Case', 'Christ', 'Journalist', 'Personal', 'Investigation', 'Evidence', 'Jesusand', 'companion', 'DVD', 'Case', 'Christ']","Case For Faith, The"
