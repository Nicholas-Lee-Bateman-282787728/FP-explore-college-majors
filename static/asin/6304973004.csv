442081,A2ELT9NS0Q8W9L,6304973004,babydoh,"[4, 6]","All Creatures Great and Small is the most wonderful series on Earth (heck, and the other planets too).  Although it doesn't really matter which episodes you begin with (the last ones were the first ones I saw) I think it's best to start at the beginning.  In the first episode of the series, &quot;Horse Sense,&quot; we see how newly-qualified vet James (Christopher Timothy) arrives in Darrowby and at the practice of Siegfried Farnon, MRCVS (Robert Hardy).  It's a great episode, which wonderfully establishes all the ACGAS characters and themes one eventually comes to know and love.However, in my opinion, the episode where the story really begins is the second one, &quot;Dog Days,&quot; in which we meet Siegfried's mischievous, irresponsible, and wonderful younger brother, Tristan (Peter Davison) who has failed all his vet school tests, not for the first time.  It is wonderful to see the relationship between Siegfried and Tristan established.  The acting is first-rate from all the cast members - and if I may cite a shallower reason for enjoying this, Tristan is ADORABLE.  (I hope the capital letters suffice as description.)  There are also a bunch of animals in each episode, all of whom rival him for the cuteness title, depending on your point of view.I guarantee you will enjoy this series.",5,WARNING: The following review contains unrestrained gushing,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,1308,"['Creatures', 'Great', 'Small', 'most', 'wonderful', 'series', 'Earth', 'heck', 'other', 'planets', 'too', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'begin', 'last', 'ones', 'were', 'first', 'ones', 'saw', 'think', 'best', 'start', 'beginning', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'quot', 'Horse', 'Sense', 'quot', 'see', 'how', 'newly-qualified', 'vet', 'James', 'Christopher', 'Timothy', 'Darrowby', 'practice', 'Siegfried', 'Farnon', 'MRCVS', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'great', 'episode', 'wonderfully', 'ACGAS', 'characters', 'themes', 'one', 'eventually', 'know', 'love.However', 'opinion', 'episode', 'where', 'story', 'really', 'second', 'one', 'quot', 'Dog', 'Days', 'quot', 'meet', 'Siegfried', 'mischievous', 'irresponsible', 'wonderful', 'younger', 'brother', 'Tristan', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'who', 'failed', 'vet', 'school', 'tests', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'wonderful', 'see', 'relationship', 'Siegfried', 'Tristan', 'established', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'members', 'may', 'cite', 'shallower', 'reason', 'enjoying', 'Tristan', 'ADORABLE', 'hope', 'capital', 'letters', 'suffice', 'description', 'are', 'also', 'bunch', 'animals', 'episode', 'whom', 'rival', 'cuteness', 'title', 'depending', 'point', 'view.I', 'guarantee', 'will', 'enjoy', 'series']",All Creatures Great & Small - The Complete Series 1 Collection VHS

Then we moved to where we did not get cable and I missed the last 4 years. When I found the series was available on Amazon in DVD I got all 7 seasons, and began to watch them in 2011. Then we moved, and lo and behold, I found them on Amazon Prime this spring (2013), and have watched most of season one again.The Amazon Prime experience is much better than the DVD in terms of picture quality. In terms of story, setting, and characters, it doesn't get better than this. Wonderful animals bring out the best, and sometimes the worst, in their people. The Yorkshire Dales accent becomes easier to understand as you move through the episodes, and it helps to have read (and reread) the books. This series hasn't aged a bit, and is fully equal to Downton Abbey, which I also adore. Likewise, Upstairs Downstairs.  All available for free on Amazon Prime.

For my English literature class in highschool I was required to write a paper on the works of a Bristish author. I choose James Herriot because the storyline revolved around a veterinary practice in the Yorkshire Dells. At this point in my life I was seriously considering vet-med college. This was back in the early 1980's while James Herriot was still relatively unknown in the USA. Imagine my delight when I turned on the television one Friday evening after reading several chapters of ""All Creatures Great and Small"" to discover the BBC had produced a series based on the books! The writing, directing, and acting are brillant in seasons 1 through 3 of this series.

442115,A11HB3LYLIQNZP,6304973004,"PhiloX ""PhiloX""","[12, 12]","Our Background: My wife, who was born in Russia, yet lived near Kiev Ukraine in a Soviet commune farm, loved reading the books ""All Creatures Great & Small"" from James Herriot (real name: Alf Wight). When we got married & she moved to the United States, we both fell in love with movie adaptations from Jane Austin's novels. This lead to a British TV series invasion in our house, starting with ""Darling Buds of May"" & later when we found the DVD book set of ""All Creatures Great & Small"". Let's give it a try...The Production: The TV series ""All Creatures Great & Small"" started in Great Britain on January 1978 with no nonsense photography with the typical grain of that time period. Some photography scenes were taken direct off Yorkshire farms. There are very little special effects, the only ones I can think of is either drugged or fake animals to act out certain quick scenes. Were some of the animals trained to act like they were sick or dying? Sometimes certain operations were preformed with a human hand, checking the rear of certain animals for pregnancies or intestinal problems. At times when the actors themselves are seen performing inspections on the animals, their hands were either hidden behind the animals or the actors were making faces with the lower parts of their bodies off the screen. Very down to Earth & as real as possible with great effect.The Actors: Christopher Timothy plays James Herriot, a Scottish newly qualified Veterinarian traveling down to Yorkshire England for a job interview with Veterinarian Surgeon Siegfried Farnon, played by Robert Hardy, in the town & farming community of Darrowby during the 1930's. Later Veterinary student & Siegfried's younger brother Tristan, played by Peter Davison (later to become the fifth Dr. Who), who travels back & forth during college. Also in the house is the housekeeper, Mrs. Hall, played by Mary Hignett. At last after dating James through the first of the series & then marring him is Helen, played by Carol Drinkwater. Our favorite minor character is Mrs. Pumphrey, played by Margarette Scott, a rich widower who has a Pekingese dog Tricki Woo. Mrs. Pumphrey constantly over feeds the dog almost to death, which James rescues with a diet, & he is awarded grommet treats of cigars & Port.Commentary: The first program started out rather slow with references to British & Scottish language problems & it was not until the third or fourth program that we both started to understand & enjoy the series. In the end it was like experiencing new neighbors in our family room each night. This box set comes with 4 DVD's: at three to four 50 to 55 minute programs per DVD. The last DVD comes with an interview with the real James Herriot: Alf Wight.If you like the first DVD box set series, there are now two other DVD Box sets, the second & third seasons, & a single DVD of 2 specials from the mid 1980's. ""All Creatures Great & Small"" did return to British TV in the late 1980's with 4 seasons, but these are only on VHS at this time.

The stories of James Herriot's life as a vet in rural Yorkshire were just heartwarming and funny as he deals with the local farmers and their ways and traditions much less trying to understand their dialect.  The Farnon brothers, Siegfried and Tristan are the ultimate in eccentricity.  Siegfried, the older brother and principal partner is a man of contradictions who drives everyone over the top yet he remains kind and caring of not only the animals and their owners but his partner as well.  Tristan the slacker, vet student, partier, and younger brother gets a lot of laughs with his constant schemes and pranks and often suffers the wrath of Sigfried in his mission to reform Tristan.  There is romance thrown in as well as we are introduced to Helen Alderson who with a lot of dating mishaps finally becomes the wife of James Herriot.  The individual stories of animals and their owners is sometimes heartbreaking but there are a lot of miracles thrown in.  The special feature on the DVD is of Alf Wight, the vet who wrote the stories under the pen name of James Herriot, as he talks of his life as a vet.

Even though the video is not of HD quality, the sceneries of 'Darrowby' are beautiful to watch. Very beautiful for a show taken in 1978.One might get a feeling that the show is too slow. But that should go away after the first two episodes. The first two episodes are all about introducing the characters and setting up the 'stage' for the remainder of the series. My wife and I could not stop watching and we watched all the episodes of the First Series in one weekend.

This charming little series is based on the wildly popular, real-life James Herriot veterinary stories set in the Yorkshire Dales. A mixture of drama and very witty comedy, the main characters are played to perfection by Christopher Timothy, Robert Hardy, and Peter Davison, supported by a fine cast of British character actors as the &quot;good country people&quot; of the dales.The DVDs are pretty standard - the interior video footage is quite clean and nice, but the 16mm film exteriors is often grainy and dirty (this is improved somewhat on the series 2 set). The only supplement is on disc 4 - a one-hour 1980s interview with the real James Herriot, veterinarian Alf Wight. Still, the real joy is in the episodes themselves.

Certainly, this delightful comedy-drama is one of our entire family's all-time favourites--one which we've watched numerous times and continue to enjoy to this day.Though the names of people and places were changed, the series is based on the true stories of Yorkshire veterinarian, James Herriot (the nom de plume of Alf Wight, who sadly died of prostate cancer in 1995 at age 78).  The series opens in the early 1930s with James (played by Christopher Timothy), a serious-minded and very conscientious newly qualified vet, arriving in the tiny Yorkshire farming town of Darrowby for a job interview at Skeldale House, the home/surgery of veterinarian Siegfried Farnon (Robert Hardy).  Siegfried, though a very competent vet and an extremely generous man, is one of the most contrary and mercurial individuals.  Heaven help the other members of the practice, who walk on eggshells most of the time as it is, should he get a bee in his bonnet about something!  The third member of the practice (if one can call him that, for he's still a veterinary student in the early episodes), is Siegfried's younger brother (and polar opposite in temperament), Tristan (Peter Davison).  Tristan is a gregarious, skirt-chasing practical joker and one of the laziest individuals around.  Certainly, he'd rather have a pint, play a prank, or chat up the girls than study for exams or be on call at the surgery.  The stage is set then for some very comical situations, which are rendered all the funnier and all the more welcome as relief from the very real drama of the stories.Apart from the vets, the series is peppered with a wealth of memorable characters.  There's the Farnons' good-hearted but no-nonsense, mother-hen housekeeper, Mrs. Hall (sadly, the actress portraying her died after the third series); and who can forget the gruff, tight-fisted, cheap-skate farmer, Mr. Biggins--the bane of the practice; or wealthy (and demonstrably grateful!) Mrs. Pumphrey, whose pampered pekingese Tricki Woo suffers a host of complaints related to his rich diet and idle lifestyle.  Of course, one mustn't forget James' devoted wife Helen (Carol Drinkwater, who was replaced by Lynda Bellingham in the fourth series)--their courtship provided the basis for much humour in the early episodes--or the larger-than-life Granville Bennett (James Grout), whose veterinary skill is matched only by his hospitality and his ability to consume copious amounts of alchohol (not to mention food!), much to James' immense discomfort and embarassment.With thirteen 50-minute episodes, this boxed set contains the complete first series.  Produced in 1978 and set against the backdrop of the magnificent Yorkshire dales, this is a thoroughly entertaining series which, like the wonderful books that inspired it, takes one through the gamut of emotions--from laughter to tears.  It is a series which transports the viewer back to a time and way of life that is, in many ways sadly, gone forever.  It is sure to be enjoyed by anyone looking for quality entertainment that the whole family can enjoy, but it will especially be treasured by fellow animal lovers.There are, at the time of writing, four boxed sets (containing the complete first four series) plus a DVD with two special episodes (its video counterpart only contains the first special, unfortunately), and I highly recommend the entire series.  If you enjoy the first boxed set, by all means go ahead and purchase the remaining sets (and specials), as the entire series is outstanding.  There are still another two or three series that have yet to be brought to video/DVD, and I know I'm not alone in hoping the BBC will release them sometime soon.  Indeed, if ever a series deserved to be released in its entirety, it is this one.

442136,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,6304973004,Utah Blaine,"[23, 23]","These DVDs contain the entire first season of the BBC's production of the series `All Creatures Great and Small'.  Each episode represents, more or less, one chapter from James Herriott's epinonymous novels.  This is one of the very few cases in which the film/TV version is as good as the book.  These DVDs are absolutely outstanding.  The story centers on a vet freshly out of veterinary school in the 1930s who is learning about his profession and about life in Yorkshire. He is surrounded by a motley (eclectic? eccentric?) cast of characters.  This series was filmed in the 70s and 80s, so that the production quality is rather low by modern standards.  I do not view this as a drawback, though.  It really gives the series a more realistic, almost gritty, less glitzy look.  The acting is superb, particularly by Christopher Timothy and Robert Hardy.  Good acting is almost non-existent on television today.  The animals are, of course, the stars of this series as well.These stories are about life and all its little (and not so little) ups and downs.  Each episode contains several story threads, some of which weave their way through the entire series, some only lasting one or a few episodes.  We watch James, the main character, develop his trade, learn to understand the Yorkshire locals, make lasting friendships, and fall in love.  In short, we follow James living his life with all his successes and defeats, big and small.  The full range of human emotions are on display in this series, the stories are hilarious, frustrating, sad, and hopeful in turn.  The message promoted throughout this series is to enjoy the simple life and accept what life throws at you for better or worse.If I had any negative comment at all, it would be that the series slowly declines after the first few years (a not uncommon problem).  This is a minor quibble, and the entire series is well worth the money spent.  I watch these DVDs over and over, and when I have a bad day, I dream of going down to the Drover's Arms to have a pint with James and Tristan.
