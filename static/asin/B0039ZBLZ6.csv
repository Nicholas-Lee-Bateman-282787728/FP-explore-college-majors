Well, technically the same party still rules the country but it is a far different, much tamer organization chosen through democratic elections. A U.S. FBI agent is investigating a murder of a Taiwanese national by hired guns. The trail quickly leads to unexpected individuals in Taiwan. Through the thriller setting some of Taiwan's fascinating (and sad) history is revealed.The movie is not perfect and some of the atrocities are reflective of the 50s rather than the 80s but the movie is still engaging, educational, and worth watching.",4,an educational thriller,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,649,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'obscure', 'locale', 'scare', 'away', 'thriller', 'place', 'Taiwan', 'communists', 'rule', 'Well', 'technically', 'same', 'party', 'still', 'rules', 'country', 'far', 'different', 'much', 'tamer', 'organization', 'chosen', 'democratic', 'elections', 'U.S.', 'FBI', 'agent', 'investigating', 'murder', 'Taiwanese', 'national', 'hired', 'guns', 'trail', 'quickly', 'unexpected', 'individuals', 'Taiwan', 'thriller', 'setting', 'Taiwan', 'fascinating', 'sad', 'history', 'revealed.The', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'atrocities', 'are', 'reflective', '50s', 'rather', '80s', 'movie', 'still', 'engaging', 'educational', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
1334435,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0039ZBLZ6,Eric Sanberg,"[4, 6]","When I was in grade school the 'Cold War' was in full swing. In the social studies class we learned that Chiang Kai Shek fled the evil communists of mainland China and settled in Taiwan and put up with the paranoia of invasion as an aftermath. The textbooks managed to leave out all the other nasty stuff portrayed in this movie.Here's the scoop. A university professor is murdered (assassinated) in Chicago. As the killers are found to be Taiwanese who have fled back to the homeland, an FBI agent, played by James Van Der Beek, is sent to Taiwan to ""assist/ observe"" in the investigation. It takes him little time to realize this is all smoke in mirrors and finds out all sorts of things about Taiwan and their relationship with the U.S. that no one would like the American people to know. His cowboy approach to the investigation gets him in hot water and gets him to question his role as an FBI agent.This is a good meat and potatoes political thriller. It lists 6 writers but actually could have had a bit (just a bit) better script. The director, Adam Kane, is a cinematographer/ director with a lot of TV under his belt and it shows. This is a very good movie, but could have been phenomenal were it punched up just a few more notches. The power is in the story itself. The opening credits mention that it is ""based on a true story"" so you know much of it had to be tweeked for filming purposes, but my guess is that is for the narrative. I'd bet the fundamentals of the situation are correct.I had no idea of the situation in Taiwan and, as of now, I would consider not purchasing one single item more that is manufactured there. And it really makes me want to spit that our government is in league with a country like this. They are an oppressive government that sees the rights of its people as nonexistent.Van Der Beek does a good job as the agent, though I do wonder why they felt the need to have him sporting a 3 day growth of beard. Would he have looked too young were he clean shaven? All the production values are good and steady. As I mentioned, with a few more dollars and a few better names in writing and directing and this could have been an amazing film as opposed to really good.If you like this sort of thing this is a good outing.

We were afraid to say anything negative about the government because spies are everywhere.In many aspects, Taiwan was controlled by the Chinese Nationalist from China, the KMT, who used the same tricks as the Communists to terrorize the people into submission.My family was classified as political dissidents and were persecuted for many years.Everything you see in the movie is true 100% if not already watered down.With the new president Ma, the old Chinese Nationalist practices are coming back and he's working together with the communists to take over Taiwan, an already independent sovereign nation for almost 100 years.Watch this movie, and buy many copies to spread the word and support the cause.People in the US need to know why there's a Taiwan Relations Act--a law of USA to protect Taiwan.This movie will tell you why and it's urgency.Taiwan is the only Chinese Mandarin speaking country in the world that has democracy.China communists and the new Ma regime are doing everything within their evil powers to prevent Taiwan from moving forward in democracy and move Taiwan into taken over by the communist in China.I saw this movie in the theater and met the producers and director.Great people, great movie, great cause.Be a voice for freedom, be a voice for democracy!",5,"Buy one for yourself, buy 10 to give to friends",1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,1584,"['family', 'lived', 'through', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'described', 'movie', 'not', 'more', 'cruel', 'vivid.Jail', 'torture', 'being', 'monitored', 'followed', 'threatened', 'phone-tapping', 'are', 'just', 'part', 'regular', 'everyday', 'life', 'Taiwan', '30-50', 'years', 'ago.We', 'were', 'penalized', 'speak', 'mother', 'tongue', 'elementary', 'school', 'were', 'afraid', 'say', 'anything', 'negative', 'government', 'spies', 'are', 'everywhere.In', 'many', 'aspects', 'Taiwan', 'was', 'controlled', 'Chinese', 'Nationalist', 'China', 'KMT', 'who', 'used', 'same', 'tricks', 'Communists', 'terrorize', 'people', 'submission.My', 'family', 'was', 'classified', 'political', 'dissidents', 'were', 'persecuted', 'many', 'years.Everything', 'see', 'movie', 'true', '100', '%', 'not', 'already', 'watered', 'new', 'president', 'Ma', 'old', 'Chinese', 'Nationalist', 'practices', 'are', 'coming', 'back', 'working', 'together', 'communists', 'take', 'over', 'Taiwan', 'already', 'independent', 'sovereign', 'nation', 'almost', '100', 'years.Watch', 'movie', 'buy', 'many', 'copies', 'spread', 'word', 'support', 'cause.People', 'US', 'need', 'know', 'why', 'Taiwan', 'Relations', 'Act', 'law', 'USA', 'protect', 'Taiwan.This', 'movie', 'will', 'tell', 'why', 'urgency.Taiwan', 'only', 'Chinese', 'Mandarin', 'speaking', 'country', 'world', 'democracy.China', 'communists', 'new', 'Ma', 'regime', 'are', 'doing', 'everything', 'evil', 'powers', 'prevent', 'Taiwan', 'moving', 'forward', 'democracy', 'move', 'Taiwan', 'taken', 'over', 'communist', 'China.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'met', 'producers', 'director.Great', 'people', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'cause.Be', 'voice', 'freedom', 'be', 'voice', 'democracy']",N/A

Huff ""An old reader""","[1, 2]","This was a nice try at capturing the more sinister side of the Chiang regime (aka ""Republic of China"") on its captive island.  I thought, however, the film suffered from choppy continuity and unconvincing moments.  (A man alllowed to stagger around in the streets, covered in blood, by the ""totalitarian regime"" that tortured him and killed his family.)  Also it was obviously not filmed in Taiwan: however noir its politics, Taipei was physically a shiny new place in the 80s. Also disappointing is that little was said of the 2/28 Incident, the mass reprisal for the ""anti-colonial uprising"" of native Formosans against the US-supported KMT conquest, the uncovering of which was the basis for the plot.  A film about the atrocity itself might have been more illuminating, though the pressures exerted by the ""Taiwan Lobby"" to scotch such a production would doubtless have been enormous.As an aside, I find the cold war views of the US attache ironic: the valiant little island must be supported and armed to the teeth in its defense from mainland aggression, and its one-man dictatorship defended as necessary for internal security.  Yet how easily this insight is forgotten close to home, when Cuba suffers under the same twin oppressions - thanks in large measure to the same ""patron of freedom"" that coddled the RoC.  :D",3,Good attempt,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,1325,"['was', 'nice', 'try', 'capturing', 'more', 'sinister', 'side', 'Chiang', 'regime', 'Republic', 'China', 'captive', 'island', 'thought', 'however', 'film', 'suffered', 'choppy', 'continuity', 'unconvincing', 'moments', 'man', 'alllowed', 'stagger', 'around', 'streets', 'covered', 'blood', 'totalitarian', 'regime', 'tortured', 'killed', 'family', 'Also', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'filmed', 'Taiwan', 'however', 'politics', 'Taipei', 'was', 'physically', 'shiny', 'new', 'place', '80s', 'Also', 'disappointing', 'little', 'was', 'said', '2/28', 'Incident', 'mass', 'reprisal', 'anti-colonial', 'uprising', 'native', 'Formosans', 'US-supported', 'KMT', 'conquest', 'uncovering', 'was', 'basis', 'plot', 'film', 'atrocity', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'illuminating', 'pressures', 'exerted', 'Taiwan', 'Lobby', 'scotch', 'production', 'would', 'doubtless', 'have', 'been', 'aside', 'find', 'cold', 'war', 'views', 'US', 'attache', 'ironic', 'valiant', 'little', 'island', 'must', 'be', 'supported', 'armed', 'teeth', 'defense', 'mainland', 'aggression', 'one-man', 'dictatorship', 'defended', 'necessary', 'internal', 'security', 'how', 'easily', 'insight', 'forgotten', 'close', 'home', 'when', 'Cuba', 'suffers', 'same', 'twin', 'oppressions', 'thanks', 'large', 'measure', 'same', 'patron', 'freedom', 'coddled', 'RoC', 'D']",N/A

However Kelly's friendship to Ming didnt ring true and 75% of the scenes moved too slowly. The opening scene (airport shoot-out) was actually the most exciting part of the entire film. Too bad the director couldnt maintain the same pace throughout. I dont expect the excitement of ""Bourne Identity"" but this was more boring than a simple made-for-TV movie like ""Remember Me.""
