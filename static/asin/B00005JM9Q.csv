I even liked it much better than &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; movie. I'm in my 20s and even I liked it. Its such a cute movie.The movie starts off from where the tv series left off. Its graduation time and Lizzie and the gang are finally graduating from middle school. Lizzie has to make a speech and since she's very nervous talking in front of people, she just makes a mess out of things. Its explained that her best girl friend Miranda isn't at graduation because she's in some trip in Mexico.After that hideous scenario Lizzie and her friends head to a graduation trip to Rome before starting high school. Lizzie hopes to start over and leave her past behind her. Once in Rome Lizzie bumps into famous singing sensation Paulo who mistakes her for Italian pop star Isabella.Isabella looks just like Lizzie except that she's got black hair. In reality Duff is playing both roles. She corrects his mistake and he asks to meet her the next day, she eventually agrees.She pretends to be sick and manages to fool her eccentric but strict chaperone Ms. Undermire, after the class leaves for a day of sightseeing, Lizzie sneaks out and meets Paulo. He takes her and shows her Rome. He convinces Lizzie to pretend to be Isabella at an upcoming awards show to avoid a lawsuit from the record label and Lizzie eventually agrees in order to help him out.Meanwhile...Gordo is covering for Lizzie and figuring out that Paulo is shady and has something up his sleeve, and Matt back at the states with the help of his conniving friend Melina wants to find another way to humiliate Lizzie.They find out through the internet that Lizzie is mistaken for the famous pop star Isabella and figure out that they can humiliate Lizzie even more. Matt manages to convince his parents that he really misses Lizzie so the whole family gets on an airplane to Rome to visit Lizzie.Kate eventually figures out what Lizzie is up to since she's Lizzie's roommate and covers for Lizzie. Its so predictable but it was still cool to see how it would all end. It was cool seeing the different sights of Rome. Okay now I want to go to Rome myself. I also like when Lizzie stepped onto stage and did her show. That was fun.Overall its a cute movie that I'd definately recommend.",5,Better than I thought it would be....,1062892800,"09 7, 2003",2003,2378,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'finally', 'saw', 'liked', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'liked', 'much', 'better', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'quot', 'movie', ""'m"", '20s', 'even', 'liked', 'such', 'cute', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'where', 'tv', 'series', 'left', 'off', 'graduation', 'time', 'Lizzie', 'gang', 'are', 'finally', 'graduating', 'middle', 'school', 'Lizzie', 'make', 'speech', 'very', 'nervous', 'talking', 'front', 'people', 'just', 'mess', 'things', 'explained', 'best', 'girl', 'friend', 'Miranda', ""n't"", 'graduation', 'trip', 'Mexico.After', 'hideous', 'scenario', 'Lizzie', 'friends', 'head', 'graduation', 'trip', 'Rome', 'starting', 'high', 'school', 'Lizzie', 'start', 'leave', 'past', 'Once', 'Rome', 'Lizzie', 'bumps', 'famous', 'singing', 'sensation', 'Paulo', 'who', 'Italian', 'pop', 'star', 'Isabella.Isabella', 'just', 'like', 'Lizzie', 'got', 'black', 'hair', 'reality', 'Duff', 'playing', 'roles', 'mistake', 'meet', 'next', 'day', 'eventually', 'agrees.She', 'pretends', 'be', 'sick', 'fool', 'eccentric', 'strict', 'chaperone', 'Ms.', 'Undermire', 'class', 'day', 'sightseeing', 'Lizzie', 'out', 'meets', 'Paulo', 'Rome', 'Lizzie', 'pretend', 'be', 'Isabella', 'upcoming', 'awards', 'show', 'avoid', 'lawsuit', 'record', 'label', 'Lizzie', 'eventually', 'order', 'help', 'out.Meanwhile', 'Gordo', 'covering', 'Lizzie', 'figuring', 'out', 'Paulo', 'shady', 'something', 'up', 'sleeve', 'Matt', 'back', 'states', 'help', 'conniving', 'friend', 'Melina', 'find', 'way', 'humiliate', 'Lizzie.They', 'find', 'out', 'internet', 'Lizzie', 'mistaken', 'famous', 'pop', 'star', 'Isabella', 'figure', 'out', 'can', 'humiliate', 'Lizzie', 'even', 'more', 'Matt', 'convince', 'parents', 'really', 'Lizzie', 'whole', 'family', 'airplane', 'Rome', 'visit', 'Lizzie.Kate', 'eventually', 'out', 'what', 'Lizzie', 'Lizzie', 'roommate', 'covers', 'Lizzie', 'so', 'predictable', 'was', 'still', 'cool', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'was', 'cool', 'seeing', 'different', 'sights', 'Rome', 'Okay', 'now', 'want', 'go', 'Rome', 'also', 'when', 'Lizzie', 'stepped', 'stage', 'did', 'show', 'was', 'fun.Overall', 'cute', 'movie', ""'d"", 'definately', 'recommend']",The Lizzie McGuire Movie

There'd be no point in watching a movie where she goes on a normal trip and nothing happens, that'd be boring.

You'll enjoy it if you've never seen the show. Granted, if you have seen the show, you'll already know the background of the characters and have more emotional investment in them as well.So in the movie, Lizzie, best friend Gordo, and some school friends go on a trip to Rome. Their new principal is their tour guide and while she shows them around beautiful Italy, she's also trying to whip them into shape for high school, which is really funny and one of the reasons the movie is so enjoyable to watch. Lizzie gets involved with an Italian pop singer, who wants her to pose as his ex-partner Isabella that Lizzie (coincidence?) looks exactly like.The plot may be unrealistic and fluffy, but that's this movie's charm. It wouldn't be Lizzie McGuire if it weren't a bit cheesy, but in a good way. Hilary Duff gives a fun performance as usual and after this movie, girls will no doubt try to be exactly like her because that's the kind of star quality Hilary carries.I recommend this movie to anyone who's looking to smile and laugh and go &quot;awwww&quot; in the end. It's the kind of movie that is perfect for curling up on the couch in your PJ's. So see this movie, whether you like Lizzie or not.

I wonder if they will use the same pic as the poster, or the sweet smiling Lizzie pic from the limited edition CD soundtrack. I hope it's the latter.Here's my review of the movie:Ok, I am not a Disney Channel fan, other than the occasional Mickey Mouse reruns, I never even tune in to that channel. I'm a Mickey fan. However I am aware of ""Lizzie"" through posters and other propagandas that they sell in stores over here. They also have a lot of teenybopper mags with Hilary on the cover (ok, I don't read the mags, but I notice them in stores!) Anyway, I haven't even seen an episode of the show when I saw a trailer of this movie, and I thought that the storyline is strange, because I thought Lizzie was just a little kid, and now she's hanging out with a stranger and singing on stage. I thought nothing of the preview, except for the fact that I noticed that Lizzie's not that little girl in the posters and ads anymore, she's growing into a lovely young lady with a precious, dazzling killer  smile.I saw a couple episodes of the show before the movie premiered, and I thought the show was okay...and I can't believe I actually chose to watch this movie first before XMEN 2. There must've been like 10 people in the theatre, since this is the first show and school isn't out yet for the little kids.I liked the first few scenes where the family is involved, because it is similar to the show. The brother is funny and I think the kid is a real talent. Once they got to Rome, it felt different, it felt kind of strange or something. And of course, Miranda is missing. It got nastier when the Paolo guy stepped into the picture, that guy can't do accents and I dunno if he can really act or not. I also didn't like the fact that everyday girl Lizzie became a famous performer in like, 4 days or so. I mean come on, I know it's Disney and stuff, but still.The movie drags in the later stages when they hang out and rehearse and try different outfits. That never really did anything to the plot, so I decided to just forget the plot and focus on Lizzie/Hilary instead. The lady can act, and she's so cute and adorable.In the end they showed this performance in the music awards, and although the song was kinda corny, I didn't mind Hilary's singing though, I think she's great. The ending was ok, the kiss could've been longer, but this is Disney. I just didn't like the flow of this movie. Kids and Lizzie fans will definitely like it. I'd rather watch an ep than the movie though. My favorite scene has got to be the first one where Lizzie sings ""The Tide Is High"" and she looks cute in it.Hilary can smile for me anytime, and that is the film's saving grace.

614864,AWVQR7YYTYJ1L,B00005JM9Q,Brittany Rose,"[0, 0]","Hilary Duff is easily the queen of the big mid-teens boom these days.  Her Disney Channel show has turned Hilary into a mega-star, and if you enjoy her clumsy yet normal antics on the tube, you'll get a kick out of her antics as she tackles Rome.The movie picks up at Lizzie's 8th grade graduation, as she is about to enter High School (Sadly the show has stopped filming, as High School is too mature for Disney viewers?).  Lizzie and a number of other kids are going on a two-week trip to Rome to meet their new principal and get a taste of culture.  Upon arriving, Lizzie makes a shocking discovery and is (kinda) torn between a new life or her old one.  The ensemble cast is at its finest in this 95 minute flick, with great preformances by Kate, Ethan, and Gordo (her classmates) who make the movie a lot more funny.  Alex Borstein, who plays the drill sargent like principal Ungermeyer really shines and is cause for some of the biggest laughs in the flick.

Disney could not have picked a better location for Rome is one of my favorite cities. The movie does well to highlight certain sites, the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, Villa d'Este (which isn't even in Rome but just northeast of it) and a montage scene when Lizzie arrives in Rome is a nice addition. After Lizzie finds herself mistaken for an Italian pop star (strange coincidence isn't it?) she goes on a whirlwind adventure trying to sneak past Ms. Ungermeyer, her teacher, who is an enjoyable character herself, while enjoying the delights of Rome.It is a little difficult seeing Lizzie McGuire as an unpopular girl in her grade. She is way too cute to not be part of the in-crowd and has a fantastic wardrobe (although I could not imagine walking around the cobblestone streets of Rome in the hot Mediterranean sun in heels) while Lizzie's quasi-nemesis Kate wears suits daily and is mean to everyone.Bottom line is that this is a fun, believe-in-yourself-and-your-dreams-will-come-true Disney story.

It's protagonist is Lizzie McGuire from Disney's TV series, in the film Lizzie goes to Rome for a class trip(pretty expensive class trip, but nevermind). While in Rome Lizzie meets up with a cute-ish boy, (I honestly forget his name, I thinnk it's Paolo) who wants Lizzie to be part of his act, his partner having just recently quit. The that Lizzie speaks no Italian doesn't seem to matter even tough the group is allegedly one of the hottest groups in all of Italy. Actually no one in the film speaks Italian, and the have some odd accent. Anyway Lizzie decides to take the allegdly Italian (He has an American accent people!)heartthrob up on the offer, thus ditching her group and leaving boy pal Gordo to explain her absence. After awhile we learn the the Italian-ish guy is a cad and LMM tries to teach us a lesson about friendship and loyalty or something. Oh, and the movie features nauseating and irritating carton Lizzies that echo Lizzie's thoughts. The movie also lacks charactars from the show most notably Lizzie best friend MirandaI saw the previews for this movie wherein Hilary Duff, who plays Lizzie assures the audience the the movie was filmed in Rome Italy, not Rome, New York.

614884,AZ5NC17FL5O85,B00005JM9Q,Karl Simon Scriba,"[1, 1]","For me, this is one of the most heart-warming and self-discovery filled movies I have seen.  In this masterpiece of a film made from Disney's hit television show &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; we are all shown the true meaning of friendship and loyalty.  The adventures of Lizzie McGuire is something people of all ages can see value and entertainment in, as well as the deep feelings we all experience.Lizzie McGuire, the star of the movie, is about to graduate from junior high.  And as usual, her life is full of things that are totally bothersome.  There's Kate, the girl at school who treats Lizzie like dirt and who always tries to make Lizzie feel inferior (in my opinion, Lizzie, you are totally superior to Kate).  Then there's Matt, Lizzie's bratty and obnoxious little brother, who's always trying to make Lizzie embarressed and get money for himself.  Just like in the series, Lizzie has three people who she can turn to for anything, her mother and father and her best friend Gordo, who is a lot like Lizzie in more ways than I can even count.  After a totally disasterous graduation ceremony, Lizzie goes on a school trip to Rome, Italy, totally excited to leave the life where she feels like she can't do anything without embarressing herself.  In Rome, she and Gordo make a promise to each other to have an adventure on this trip.  Later, Lizzie makes a wish by tossing a coin into the Trevi Fountain, and suddenly, as if it comes true, she meets the man of her dreams, Paolo, an Italian rockstar.  Lizzie soon learns that she looks identical to Paolo's singing partner, Isabella, except for the hair.  Isabella has brown hair and Lizzie has blond hair.  And what's more, all the people in Italy think that Lizzie is Isabella.  Paolo asks Lizzie to fill in for Isabella in a concert that will send his career skyward.  Lizzie is excited, but Gordo is suspicious, thinking that there is more to Paolo than meets the eye.  As Gordo uncovers some secrets of Paolo's, both Lizzie and Gordo are in for the time of their lives!A totally appluade Hilary Duff for this movie.  If you want a movie that will be total entertainment from the whole family, this is it.  I see Lizzie as the shy, nervous, and beautiful girl who is just trying to fit in without success, but inside, I see a spirit greater than anyone else's around her and a heart of gold.  Lizzie's true nature, good heart, and willingness to help others make her a true young heroine.  And the best scene is the concert scene, where Lizzie is at her finest and most musical!  Another thing that the movie has is great music.  Lizzie McGuire fans will not be dissappointed.",5,A terrific movie!

614888,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JM9Q,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","I had never seen the television version of &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; and all I really know about Hillary Duff is that her mom does not like Lindsay Lohan (I bought a copy of Duff's CD for my daughter for Christmas and completely spaced that out).  But it did not take long to pick up on who is who in &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie.&quot;  Hillary Duff is Lizzie McGuire, who is having trouble being a teenager, mainly because her pesky younger brother Matt (Jake Thomas) is videotaping her worst moments for posterity and/or blackmailing purposes while mom (Jo McGuire) and dad (Robert Carradine) are supportive but essentially clueless.  Her best friend Gordo (Adam Lamberg) is obviously smitten with Lizzie, but all she sees is her best friend Gordo.  Kate (Ashlie Brillault) is the snobby girl who makes Hillary feel inferior and Ethan (Clayton Snyder) is the resident space cadet.  So getting up to speed is not a problem.  That comes when we get to the plot.Having graduated junior high, which was a disaster in and of itself, Lizzie and her classmates immediately head for Rome as part of some strange program at their new high school that sends freshmen on a trip to Europe so they can get some appropriate degree of culture that will allow them to do well.  Their chaperone is their principal, Miss Ungermeyer (Alex Borstein), because she has nothing better to do in the summer but indoctrinate incoming freshman while in a foreign land.Once they get into Rome things get complicated.  Lizzie runs into Paolo Valisari (Yani Gallman), an Italian pop idol who says she looks exactly like his singing partner, Isabella, except Lizzie is a blond.  It seems Isabella is mad at Paolo and they are going to get sued if they do not show up to present an award at an award show at Coliseum.  So, of course, Lizzie should take Isabella's place.  But it turns out to be a lot more complicated than that, which is just a way of setting up the big finale involving Lizzie McGuire singing a new hit song by Hillary Duff (that was probably on that aforementioned Hillary Duff album).Now, this is all completely standard teenage movie fare, where the movie is not over until the same actress playing two different characters shows up.  But in the finale of this one, once it is explained what is really going on with Paolo's plan, it turns out to be really stupid (if the plan worked it would not have worked, take my word for it).  Still, it is all just an excuse for a big production at the number, so what is really the problem here?&quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot; has several things going for it.  First, Duff can turn the world on with her smile and she gets to do that a lot.  Second, the supporting cast from the show are all comfortable in their roles and I really liked Gordo from the moment he woke up on the plan and realized that Lizzie was sleeping nestled against him; the look on his face told the whole story.  Third, most of the film is set in Rome and they take full advantage of the spectacularly beautiful sites to convince you this is where you want to plan your next trip.  As long as Lizzie is riding around on the back of Paolo's scooter at least nothing stupid can happen with the plot.  The bottom line is that I probably enjoyed this movie more than it deserved.  I was going to give it a 3.5, but I at the end I was humming the song from the finale, so I rounded up.  But watch it.  Next time I might not grade on a curve.",4,"Lizzie McGuire drags Hillary Duff to Rome, Italy",1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,3449,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'television', 'version', 'quot', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'quot', 'really', 'know', 'Hillary', 'Duff', 'mom', 'not', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'bought', 'copy', 'Duff', 'CD', 'daughter', 'Christmas', 'completely', 'spaced', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'pick', 'up', 'who', 'who', 'quot', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'Movie.', 'quot', 'Hillary', 'Duff', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'who', 'having', 'trouble', 'being', 'teenager', 'mainly', 'pesky', 'younger', 'brother', 'Matt', 'Jake', 'Thomas', 'videotaping', 'worst', 'moments', 'posterity', 'and/or', 'blackmailing', 'purposes', 'mom', 'Jo', 'McGuire', 'dad', 'Robert', 'Carradine', 'are', 'supportive', 'essentially', 'clueless', 'best', 'friend', 'Gordo', 'Adam', 'Lamberg', 'obviously', 'smitten', 'Lizzie', 'best', 'friend', 'Gordo', 'Kate', 'Ashlie', 'Brillault', 'snobby', 'girl', 'who', 'Hillary', 'feel', 'inferior', 'Ethan', 'Clayton', 'Snyder', 'resident', 'space', 'cadet', 'So', 'getting', 'up', 'speed', 'not', 'problem', 'when', 'get', 'plot.Having', 'graduated', 'junior', 'high', 'was', 'disaster', 'Lizzie', 'classmates', 'immediately', 'head', 'Rome', 'part', 'strange', 'program', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'freshmen', 'trip', 'Europe', 'can', 'get', 'appropriate', 'degree', 'culture', 'will', 'allow', 'do', 'well', 'chaperone', 'principal', 'Miss', 'Ungermeyer', 'Alex', 'Borstein', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'summer', 'indoctrinate', 'incoming', 'freshman', 'foreign', 'land.Once', 'get', 'Rome', 'things', 'get', 'complicated', 'Lizzie', 'Paolo', 'Valisari', 'Yani', 'Gallman', 'Italian', 'pop', 'idol', 'who', 'exactly', 'singing', 'partner', 'Isabella', 'Lizzie', 'blond', 'Isabella', 'mad', 'Paolo', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'sued', 'do', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'present', 'award', 'award', 'show', 'Coliseum', 'So', 'course', 'Lizzie', 'should', 'take', 'Isabella', 'place', 'out', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'complicated', 'just', 'way', 'setting', 'up', 'big', 'finale', 'involving', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'singing', 'new', 'hit', 'song', 'Hillary', 'Duff', 'was', 'probably', 'aforementioned', 'Hillary', 'Duff', 'album', '.Now', 'completely', 'standard', 'teenage', 'movie', 'fare', 'where', 'movie', 'not', 'same', 'actress', 'playing', 'two', 'different', 'characters', 'up', 'finale', 'one', 'explained', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'Paolo', 'plan', 'out', 'be', 'really', 'stupid', 'plan', 'worked', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'take', 'word', 'Still', 'just', 'excuse', 'big', 'production', 'number', 'what', 'really', 'problem', 'here', 'quot', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'Movie', 'quot', 'several', 'things', 'going', 'First', 'Duff', 'can', 'turn', 'world', 'smile', 'do', 'lot', 'Second', 'supporting', 'cast', 'show', 'are', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'really', 'liked', 'Gordo', 'moment', 'woke', 'up', 'plan', 'realized', 'Lizzie', 'was', 'sleeping', 'nestled', 'look', 'face', 'told', 'whole', 'story', 'Third', 'most', 'film', 'set', 'Rome', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'spectacularly', 'beautiful', 'sites', 'convince', 'where', 'want', 'plan', 'next', 'trip', 'As', 'long', 'Lizzie', 'riding', 'around', 'back', 'Paolo', 'scooter', 'least', 'nothing', 'stupid', 'can', 'happen', 'plot', 'bottom', 'line', 'probably', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'deserved', 'was', 'going', 'give', '3.5', 'end', 'was', 'humming', 'song', 'finale', 'rounded', 'up', 'watch', 'Next', 'time', 'might', 'not', 'grade', 'curve']",The Lizzie McGuire Movie

It is a treat for fans of the Lizzie McGuire show, the film has a similar message which is: Be true to who you are, despite the social consequences.  With uplifting songs such as ""Why Not"", which really punctuate the films message of doing what it takes to make dreams happen.We follow Lizzie as her and her fellow middle school graduating class go to Rome. She ends being mistaken for an international pop superstar and going on a whirlwind romance and performing in a live concert.

The film is just as silly, far-fetched, and sweet as the show, but without the little animated ""Lizzie"" punctuating her thoughts throughout the film.  The film really does strive to transcend above its source material by striving to be bigger and flashier, and with a broader theme.If you've ever had an outlandish fantasy of any sort, you can appreciate this, if you love the show, or if you love good & wholesome tween/family entertainment.Target age: Girls  8 - 14yrsGod Bless ~Amy",5,The Ultimate Tween fantasy... :D,1060041600,"08 5, 2003",2003,1332,"['give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'what', 'silly', 'fantasy', 'aimed', 'tween', 'crowd', 'expectations', 'treat', 'fans', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'show', 'film', 'similar', 'message', 'Be', 'true', 'who', 'are', 'social', 'consequences', 'uplifting', 'songs', 'such', 'Why', 'Not', 'really', 'punctuate', 'films', 'message', 'doing', 'what', 'make', 'dreams', 'happen.We', 'follow', 'Lizzie', 'fellow', 'middle', 'school', 'graduating', 'class', 'go', 'Rome', 'being', 'mistaken', 'international', 'pop', 'superstar', 'going', 'whirlwind', 'romance', 'performing', 'live', 'concert', 'Needless', 'say', 'when', 'was', '14yrs', 'was', 'just', 'fantasy', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'imagined', 'singing', 'own', 'songs', 'not', 'someone', ""else'.I"", 'show', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'big', 'payoff', 'end', 'fans', 'Gordo', 'film', 'just', 'silly', 'far-fetched', 'sweet', 'show', 'little', 'animated', 'Lizzie', 'punctuating', 'thoughts', 'film', 'film', 'really', 'strive', 'transcend', 'source', 'material', 'striving', 'be', 'bigger', 'flashier', 'broader', 'theme.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'outlandish', 'fantasy', 'sort', 'can', 'appreciate', 'love', 'show', 'love', 'good', 'wholesome', 'tween/family', 'entertainment.Target', 'age', 'Girls', '8', '14yrsGod', 'Bless', '~Amy']",The Lizzie McGuire Movie

The effervescent Hilary Duff stars as typical teen Lizzie, who has just made a huge spectacle of herself at her eighth grade graduation.  Luckily, Lizzie is off to Rome with her high school principal-to-be (Alex Borstein of Miss Swan/Mad TV fame) and a group of her new classmates, including snobby Kate and her best friend Gordo.In Rome, Lizzie runs into dreamy Italian Paolo, (Yani Gellman) who is struck by Lizzie's beauty and innocent charm.  Paolo wants her to fill in for his singing partner, Isabella (also played by Duff) to whom Lizzie bears a striking resemblance.  But Ms. Ungermeyer is a strict chaperone, and anyone caught breaking the rules will be on a plane back home.  Will Lizzie choose the daring route or the safe one, and what will the consequences be for her and her friends?The pop songs in this music are upbeat and inspiring, as are the scenes of Rome.

Along with Freaky Friday, and this, starring two up-and-coming actresses, Hilary Duff &amp; Lindsay Lohan. Both evoke jealousy, as they're so pretty, with clear skin, and make all the guys go weak at the knees. If only life was this simple!Hilary Duff still isn't well-known in the UK, despite releasing a single that I can't even remember the name of - it didn't really set the charts alight. In fact, she never got to perform on any of the major music TV shows here. And the Lizzie McGuire TV show hasn't really appeared here either, although I did see a tiny clip of it today when I was flicking channels. So to say she hasn't made much of an impact here, is an understatement. So what better way to make an impact, than release a movie? Which is what she does!The movie has all the major characters from the TV series, so instantly you're lost, as the characters are so well-known in America, they don't bother to think about introductions, for the people who haven't seen the TV show. The only person who's really identifiable as being famous is Hilary Duff, but that's only because of her teen romance with Aaron Carter (younger brother of Nick, Backstreet Boys) a few years ago.The only other 'major' star in this is Alex Borstein (Miss Ungermeyer), who I had quite a bit of trouble placing. She hasn't really starred in that much, having bit parts in Friends and Coyote Ugly. So if you think you recognise her, you'll have to rack what little brains you have to realise who she is. I'll give you a clue - you know her voice better than you probably know her face! And you'll probably recognise her name more, due to seeing it in credits. She's only the voice(s) for Lois Griffin/Loretta/Tricia Takanawa/Barbara Pewterschmidt, to name but a few from Family Guy! Which I thought was pretty cool!What was best about this movie? The little alter-ego Lizzie cartoon interstitials, which are so funny! They're confusing to begin with, as they're probably a prominent part in the TV series.In this Hilary plays two people - Lizzie, and Isabella. Who are both exactly the same, except one is blonde, and one is brunette. When you see Isabella at the start of the movie, she doesn't look a thing like Hilary Duff, but that kinda changes towards the end.As far as I can tell, this was basically the swan-song for the TV series, which has since ended, and all the film is really doing is pushing Hilary as a singer. For a singer, she's OK, but not really anything special. She's blonde, she's pretty, she's American, she has clear skin, how many other singers do we know like that? So whereas she has an OK voice, she has to be a bit more unique, and try and get away from the Disney sweet as sugar image she has at the moment.This is a good film, to just sit and watch, and relax. Forget about all the stresses and strains of life. And have a good old moan about the fact that you can totally tell Hilary Duff is 'pasted' (for want of a better word) onto the Colosseum backdrop/starry sky.",3,"Sweet, non-thinking fluff",1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,3041,"['God', ""'m"", 'actually', 'starting', 'kinda', 'films', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'starring', 'two', 'up-and-coming', 'actresses', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'amp', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'evoke', 'jealousy', ""'re"", 'so', 'pretty', 'clear', 'skin', 'make', 'guys', 'go', 'weak', 'knees', 'only', 'life', 'was', 'simple', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'still', ""n't"", 'well-known', 'UK', 'releasing', 'single', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'name', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'set', 'charts', 'alight', 'fact', 'never', 'got', 'perform', 'major', 'music', 'TV', 'shows', 'here', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'TV', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'appeared', 'here', 'either', 'did', 'see', 'tiny', 'clip', 'today', 'when', 'was', 'flicking', 'channels', 'So', 'say', ""n't"", 'made', 'much', 'impact', 'here', 'understatement', 'what', 'better', 'way', 'make', 'impact', 'release', 'movie', 'Which', 'what', 'movie', 'major', 'characters', 'TV', 'series', 'so', 'instantly', ""'re"", 'lost', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'well-known', 'America', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'think', 'introductions', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'TV', 'show', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'really', 'identifiable', 'being', 'famous', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'only', 'teen', 'romance', 'Aaron', 'Carter', 'younger', 'brother', 'Nick', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'few', 'years', 'ago.The', 'only', 'other', ""'major"", 'star', 'Alex', 'Borstein', 'Miss', 'Ungermeyer', 'who', 'had', 'quite', 'bit', 'trouble', 'placing', ""n't"", 'really', 'starred', 'much', 'having', 'bit', 'parts', 'Friends', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'So', 'think', 'recognise', ""'ll"", 'have', 'rack', 'what', 'little', 'brains', 'have', 'realise', 'who', ""'ll"", 'give', 'clue', 'know', 'voice', 'better', 'probably', 'know', 'face', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'recognise', 'name', 'more', 'due', 'seeing', 'credits', 'only', 'voice', 's', 'Lois', 'Griffin/Loretta/Tricia', 'Takanawa/Barbara', 'Pewterschmidt', 'name', 'few', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Which', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'What', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'little', 'alter-ego', 'Lizzie', 'cartoon', 'interstitials', 'are', 'so', 'funny', ""'re"", 'confusing', 'begin', ""'re"", 'probably', 'prominent', 'part', 'TV', 'series.In', 'Hilary', 'two', 'people', 'Lizzie', 'Isabella', 'Who', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'one', 'blonde', 'one', 'brunette', 'When', 'see', 'Isabella', 'start', 'movie', ""n't"", 'look', 'thing', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'kinda', 'changes', 'towards', 'end.As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'basically', 'swan-song', 'TV', 'series', 'ended', 'film', 'really', 'doing', 'pushing', 'Hilary', 'singer', 'singer', 'OK', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'special', 'blonde', 'pretty', 'American', 'clear', 'skin', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'singers', 'do', 'know', 'So', 'whereas', 'OK', 'voice', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'unique', 'try', 'get', 'away', 'Disney', 'sweet', 'sugar', 'image', 'moment.This', 'good', 'film', 'just', 'sit', 'watch', 'relax', 'Forget', 'stresses', 'strains', 'life', 'have', 'good', 'old', 'moan', 'fact', 'can', 'totally', 'tell', 'Hilary', 'Duff', ""'pasted"", 'want', 'better', 'word', 'Colosseum', 'backdrop/starry', 'sky']",The Lizzie McGuire Movie

You may have your own opinions about Hilary Duff and her Lizzie character, but I personally really glad that today's kids are responding to Duff's positive influence and taking her as a role model.For any fan of the show, this movie does not disappoint. It is very enjoyable, with some great moments and a whole lot to like regarding the development of the characters. That, to me, is one of the biggest strengths of the film: the way they managed to develop and even put a little twist on the main characters without totally making it dumb or unrealistic. Take Kate Sanders, for starters. What she does for Lizzie in the movie is definitely something she would have never done in the show, but something about it makes it believable anyway. You realize also what a precious person Gordo is in Lizzie's life, and of course by the end of the movie Lizzie makes the final cut from the shy, insecure young girl she used to be and finds her moment, her time to shine. Through that, her confidence comes barreling out, and don't be surprised if her final onstage performance in the end chokes you up a little. It is so awesome to see how much Lizzie has grown up, and regardless of whether or not you buy into the whole ordeal, you have to admit that this is a great movie for young girls. Some of Lizzie's awkward and embarrassing moments are a little over the edge--for example, how many school principles give a student as insecure as her the responsibility of delivering the graduation speech? And how many people completely fall over and cause an entire stage curtain to come tumbling down? The whole graduations scene was pretty dumb, and I think it would have helped a lot to have Lalaine (Miranda) appear in the movie, but it is still an overall great film. There's a decent plot, beautiful scenery from Rome, good acting, and a character and story that deserves what is has for its positive message.",4,very good for &quot;Lizzie&quot; fans......,1065139200,"10 3, 2003",2003,2003,"['.as', 'well', 'anybody', 'who', 'would', 'put', 'down', 'defenses', 'take', 'time', 'enjoy', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'may', 'have', 'own', 'opinions', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'Lizzie', 'character', 'personally', 'really', 'glad', 'today', 'kids', 'are', 'responding', 'Duff', 'positive', 'influence', 'taking', 'role', 'model.For', 'fan', 'show', 'movie', 'not', 'disappoint', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'moments', 'whole', 'lot', 'regarding', 'development', 'characters', 'one', 'biggest', 'strengths', 'film', 'way', 'managed', 'develop', 'even', 'put', 'little', 'twist', 'main', 'characters', 'totally', 'making', 'dumb', 'unrealistic', 'Take', 'Kate', 'Sanders', 'starters', 'What', 'Lizzie', 'movie', 'definitely', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'show', 'something', 'believable', 'anyway', 'realize', 'also', 'what', 'precious', 'person', 'Gordo', 'Lizzie', 'life', 'course', 'end', 'movie', 'Lizzie', 'final', 'cut', 'shy', 'insecure', 'young', 'girl', 'used', 'be', 'moment', 'time', 'shine', 'confidence', 'barreling', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'final', 'onstage', 'performance', 'end', 'chokes', 'up', 'little', 'so', 'awesome', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'Lizzie', 'grown', 'up', 'regardless', 'not', 'buy', 'whole', 'ordeal', 'have', 'admit', 'great', 'movie', 'young', 'girls', 'Lizzie', 'awkward', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'are', 'little', 'edge', 'example', 'how', 'many', 'school', 'principles', 'give', 'student', 'as', 'insecure', 'responsibility', 'delivering', 'graduation', 'speech', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'completely', 'fall', 'over', 'cause', 'entire', 'stage', 'curtain', 'come', 'tumbling', 'down', 'whole', 'graduations', 'scene', 'was', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'lot', 'have', 'Lalaine', 'Miranda', 'appear', 'movie', 'still', 'overall', 'great', 'film', 'decent', 'plot', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'Rome', 'good', 'acting', 'character', 'story', 'what', 'positive', 'message']",The Lizzie McGuire Movie

While in Rome, Lizzie hooks up with Italian pop-sensation Paolo (apparently all cute Italian boys are named Paolo, see the Olsen's ""When In Rome"" for details) and substitutes for his estranged singing-partner Isabella for whom she is a dead-ringer.  Action, adventure and romance ensue as Lizzie pursues her relationship with Paolo, lives the life of a pop star, escapes evil Principal Miss Ungermeyer, and catches all the sights of Rome.  In the midst of it all Lizzie learns some valuable life lessons courtesy of Paolo, Gordo and Kate Sanders????THE ANALYSIS:The movie starts off quite a bit slow but once in Rome the action begins to pick up.  Most of the cast from the series returns for the movie (with the noticeable absence of gal-pal best-bud Miranda).  Overall the charm of the series stays through for the movie.  Mind you, I'm not a regular of the series (seen a few bits of a few episodes when the Mrs. watches) but from what I've seen of the series it seems like it's pretty much like the show (animated Lizzie and all).THE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:You've got a pretty stuffed DVD features section here, but unfortunately A LOT of it is Disney fluff.  Included in the DVD special features are:1. ""Hilary's Roman Adventure""  - 12 minute behind the scenes feature where the cast and crew (mainly Hilary) discuss everything from the movie, their experiences filming it, comparisons to the TV show, their experiences touring Rome and Hilary's life on the set (still needs to go to school).2. ""Hilary Duff Music Video - `Why Not'""3. ""In the Recording Studio with Hilary"" - 2 minute feature where Hilary discusses her upcoming CD release.4. ""Roamin' Volare"" - The Tour of Rome scene with Lizzie and Paolo on the moped done up music video style.5. 3 deleted scenes with optional director intro commentary.6. ""Sneak Peak"" Trailers:  The multi-million dollar Disney marketing machine was in full force here!!!  This stuff actually plays when the DVD first loads but Disney was nice enough to put in a navigational link to it on the menu in case you wanted to watch it AGAIN.  Disney shills the following from their extensive product line:a. ""The Lion King Special Edition DVD""b. ""Lizzie McGuire"" TV Volume Setsc. ""Kim Possible"" TV seriesd. ""Sleeping Beauty Special Edition DVD""e. ""George of the Jungle 2""f. ""That's So Raven"" TV seriesTHE VERDICT:In all, if you're a fan of ""Lizzie McGuire"" you're bound to love the movie if you haven't seen it yet.  Too bad Hilary and Disney couldn't come to terms on a deal as the movie was an ideal branch from the original series set in Junior High to the new seasons they'd have set in High School.

Actually, looking back, there are a lot of things about it that bother me.  First of all, the cast and scenery.  All the characters seemed a little different in some way, not completely the same.  And Lizzie had a different house from that on the show.  Second, the whole movie was basically about Lizzie blowing off Gordo and lying to get out of tours so she could hang out with Paolo.  I found that to also be different from the TV series.  Usually Lizzie is at least a LITTLE nicer than that.  I also think certain things were taken to extremes in the movie, such as Matt, and Mr. and Mrs. McGuire flying all the way to Rome just because Matt missed Lizzie and the dad thought she might be around boys that wanted to be her boyfriend.  There were a few things I liked, though, such as how Lizzie and Kate got along in some parts.Overall, I would say that if you love Lizzie McGuire, you might like this movie.

Her best friend, David Gordon (Gordo, as a nickname) goes with her, along with most of the kids in her grade. When in Rome, she meets a famous Italian singing star, Paolo, and, surprise, surprise, she looks EXACTLY like Paolo's counterpart singer, Isabella (Duff, again).Lizzie gets a major crush on Paolo (again, surprise, surprise) and she agrees to impersonate Isabella in the upcoming music awards show. (Isabella, Paolo said, lip-synched and left the group because Paolo wanted to 'develop as an artist' and she didn't.)Well, in the end, everything is sorted out. Gordo finds Isabella and learns that SHE was the one that wanted to develop her music career. Paolo is exposed as having the terrible voice that he does, and Gordo and Lizzie have their first kiss.As I said, Duff's acting isn't up to par, and she's supposed to be the one that carries the whole movie.

614910,A17B9MOP3FIJUF,B00005JM9Q,"The Loved One ""curiouser and curiouser!""","[2, 2]","The summer of 2003 will be memorable for a number of reasons, but one event will stand out in my mind.  2004 was the summer in which negotiations between Disney and Hilary Duff broke down.  The bottom line was that Hilary Duff would no longer assume the mantle of Lizzie McGuire.  The working title for this film had been, ""Ciao Lizzie!"" and we see only too late that indeed this film was our goodbye to Lizzie.  Knowing that this is our last glimpse into the life of this blossoming heroine infuses The Lizzie McGuire Movie with a certain elegiac resonance.  Watching this movie is like a final parting with an intimate childhood friend who moves away before falling out of touch.The movie, though, is a fitting climax to an entertaining and warm show.  The movie faithfully concentrates and expands upon the major themes of the television program.  Lizzie, an awkward and klutzy middle school student, must respond to such character-defining challenges as remaining loyalty to friends and family, fulfilling responsibility to others, confronting her fears of not being accepted by her peers, and the general awkwardness of being a teenager.  Part of the charm of the movie is its sensitive portrait of Lizzie herself.  Lizzie must act decisively and conscientiously despite her self-doubt and clouded self-image.  What the film captures ever so subtly is Lizzie's quiet growth and the emergence of her inner strength.  We see her emerge from the battlefield of her adolescent war perhaps not unscathed but all the stronger for having survived.  At times she is lured astray by such her own vanity or the promise of indulging short terms aspirations such as being popular.  She does not always honor the right people and she blindly misplaces her affections at a whim.  But even so, in the end she has the courage to act upon her convictions, and despite the disingenuous designs manipulating her, her heart remains pure.As others have noted, many of the show's central characters are conspicuously missing.  Most noticeable is the absence of Lalaine who played Lizzie's best friend, Miranda Sanchez.  The dynamic feels stilted and incomplete without Miranda to round out Gordo's neuroticisms and Lizzie's navet&eacute;.  Also M.I.A. are such recurring characters as Larry Tudgeman, Veruca, Kate's cousin Amy (played by Hilary's big sister Haylie), Lanny, Claire, Parker, and David.  Even if they were minor characters, it still would have been a nice touch to see some of them touring Rome with Lizzie.The DVD features are on the whole attention-grabbing.  Most interesting are the ""Why Not?"" music video, the behind the scenes documentary, and the deleted scenes with an alternate ending.  I love the video for ""Why Not?"" because the lyrics personify perfectly the sheer optimism and cheerfulness that were the cardinal traits of Lizzie herself.  The documentary isn't terribly insightful, but helps to flesh out what it took to make the film and how the cast and crew approached the project.  The deleted scenes are a treat, but won't really change how you interpret the movie.  The alternate ending isn't revolutionary (i.e. Lizzie's crudely drawn alter ego doesn't come to life and kill everyone) but it is fun to imagine having it in place of the actual ending.What is perhaps most rewarding about the film is appreciating how much Lizzie has matured.  In the early episodes, she still looks very much like a little girl.  By the time she performs for a sold-out audience in the Coliseum during the film's climax, one comes to a slow realization that Lizzie is no longer a child but has become a young woman.  Though the curtains are drawn on the window into Lizzie's life and we are forced to part, we are grateful that we were privy to the formative years of this extraordinary and beloved individual, Lizzie McGuire.

Gordo also takes up for Lizzie and say that HE'S been sneaking out to have fun away from the group.3.)  Others :  They others acted the same way as they do in the show.  Kate is still mean, until Lizzie tells her the truth and that she will be a famous singer if she stays with Palo and gets ready for the award show.  Ethan is still dumb and a klutz.  He's totally a chick magnet.  Meliena acts a whole lot different and a whole lot less bossy.  You only see her once but she is in there.  Matt is still a noisy and good for nothing brother.  He finds out tha truth about Lizzie and Palo.  Sam and Jo is still the same as in the show.  They only want whats best for Lizzie and Matt and not to ruin their lives.As you can see, a lot of things are different and some things are the same as they always have been.

Hilary Duff's movies, for the most part, are really good.  However, I think her latest movie, The Perfect Man, is compromised and is hardly as good as her other movies.

614917,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JM9Q,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","When Warner has Amanda Bynes and 'What a Girl Wants,' Disney has its own starlet, charming Hiraly Duff as Lizzie McGuire.  She is more famous as pop singer here in Japan (and more popular as singer), but the film sadly went to video straight (while 'What a Girl' was theatrically released at theatres run by Warner).  So, is this so bad, as some critics say?  Not exactly.The story is just an excuse for the entended running time in which Lizzie has another misadventure, this time in Rome.  Lizzie and her friends travel to Italy guided by glum teacher Ms. Ungermeyer.  There, for some reasons I don't believe, Lizze is mistaken for Italian pop singer, and more incredibly, has to play the role for the distraught (but hunky) Italian idol singer, who welcomes the secret replacement.All these set-ups are made for Lizzie to sing in front of the audience ... and in a big stadium.  The picture-perfect location of Rome is all shot with the postcard beauty, and Lizzie is always in the middle of that.  And of course, her best friend Gordo never fails to help her out in every difficulty, even though in a clumsy way, and his platonic admiration for Lizzie, or love maybe, is quite sincerely expressed.The film has has potentially disturbing elements -- the nagging teacher could be a bully; the peksy brother of Lizzie could be annoying; and her parents could be more wooden.  But all ends well, in a miraculous way, and that's not a bad thing.  After all, it's Disney, you remember.I don't say acting is perfect, or great for that matter, but I don't think it's as bad as some people say, and Hilary Duff shows fairly good turn playing double roles.  And when she must be 'Lizzie' here, who cannot change her image on TV she was doing for four years, you cannot blame her.  This is what Disney has been doing -- like the beloved duo of Annette and Frankie in 'Beach' movies series, and why not Hilary Duff?'The Lizzie McGuire Movie' is fluff, sure, but it's lovely fluff (and why not?), for it's Hilary Duff, who is undoubtedly cute, lovely, and most importantly, accesable.  She could be your daughter, your neighbor, or your friend at school, having the very affable quality.

Every time I babysit her she puts it on, and I don't really have a problem with that. I don't like the Lizzie McGuire TV show, but the movie was actually pretty cute.It starts off with Lizzie in her room dancing and singing on the day of her junior high graduation. She's excited about growing up and moving on in her life. But at graduation, she totally embarasses herself - she trips and falls, which ends up in a curtian falling on the graduating class.Thankfully, Lizzie has the chance to forget her problems when she goes on her class trip to Rome - two weeks with no parents, her best friend, and her arch nemisis Kate is nowhere in sight. Until things take a turn for the worse, and Kate decides to go after all - and she rooms with Lizzie once they actually get to Rome. On the first day of sightseeing, Lizzie meets up with the popular Italian singer Paolo. He asks if he can see her again, and soon she's faking sick to be able to hang out with him. He tells her that she looks just like his old singing partner, but with blonde hair instead of brown, and somehow she ends up singing with him at a big awards show.This movie is cute, but totally predictable and sugarcoated. I recommed it for younger kids though, because it doesn't have any dirty humor or language.
