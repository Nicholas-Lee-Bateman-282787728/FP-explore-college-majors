130222,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,0792159659,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[1, 2]","The problem with THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER is that the central incident that has to be unravelled--the murder--is absurd, contrived, and utterly unconvincing.  It's as if the producer didn't read past the first 50 pages  of the screenplay, and when the got on the set, the director said,  &quot;all right, so there's no 'there' there, so let's do our best.&quot;  And their best is quite good, thank you.  John Travolta delivers a fine  performance in a role that calls for an intelligent-brutal cop.  Since the  cop is on an army bsse, apparently the usual rules of not beating up  suspects, etc., don't apply.  So John gets to do what he can do a lot  better than anyone else -- punch you in the mouth and smile boyishly at the  same time. Madeline Stowe as the co-star isn't much; she has a good moment  or two, but a better actress would have made those good moments chilling  (instead of just all right).  Nicole Kidman or Julia Roberts would have  taken that role and made it sing, but they were (a) probably unavailable,  (b) didn't like the script, or (c) figured that there was no much  percentage in bumping up a two star movie to a three star movie.  Because  that's all I would have given it if Kidman or Roberts had been in the film.  Basically, if you don't have a core premiss, then no matter how well you  dress it up, it's still hollow at the center.  Bottom line:  would I  recommend THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER?  Yes, if you're willing to tolerate a  hollow core.

Travolta plays a military officer who is assigned to investigate the occurrences surrounding a young female officer found bound, gagged and murdered on a military base.  James Cromwell is the girl's father (the general of the title), and Stowe is Travolta's ex-wife who is also a part of the investigation.  The film tries to throw red herrings at you for two straight hours, but one look at the billing in the opening titles easily gives away who the actual culprit is.  While you're waiting for the answer to the riddle, you're stuck watching a rambling bore full of idiotic speeches, overly melodramatic music and completely nonsubtle mysogynestic overtones (how much can director Simon West linger on closeups of the young woman's underwear being slowly pulled off her body during a gang rape scene before we scream?  Sadly, the producers of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider had forgotten about this by the time they hired him to direct it)  Written by William Goldman, who six months after the release of the film actually had the gall to write an article in Premiere criticizing that year's Academy Award nominees for Best Picture.

130231,A1T13S3JPJQ99M,0792159659,"Christopher Crossley ""The Man from Hubei""","[2, 4]","Risking one's life is part and parcel of being a soldier in any army, yet Paul Brenner's (John Travolta) life is truly on the line at the start of the movie when, masquerading as ""Sergeant Frank White"", he tackles a gun smuggling run involving both insiders and a rather nasty character who clearly loves the feel of a semi-automatic weapon in his hands. This is, however, just a tangential sub-plot ending in a flurry of fire on and around an old barge at night that culminates in the bad guy, Belling (Peter Weireter), getting his just desserts.Once that is ended, the movie concentrates on the real story. Captain Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson) is found dead, her naked body tied on the ground to stakes. This ""discovery"" is somewhat intriguing, considering that the body lies out in the open on a part of an army base in Georgia (USA) used for urban close quarter combat practice and bomb disposal. No attempt was made whatsoever to conceal the woman's corpse, an examination of which seemed to indicate no violation in any sexual way - even more intriguing.Brenner is irked to find that a ""rape counselor"" is also on the scene and he tells Colonel Bill Kent (Timothy Hutton) brusquely: ""[The body] doesn't need a rape counselor - she's dead!"" It turns out that the counselor is fellow U.S. Army warrant officer Sarah Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe), who just happens to be Brenner's former flame, a somewhat predictable ""relationship"" conforming to a certain Hollywood formula.Brenner and Sunhill meet the grieving father, none other than the general commanding the base, Major General Joseph Campbell (James Cromwell), who wants justice for his daughter yet, at the same time, it appears that he knows more than he is letting on. His loyal aide, Colonel George Fowler (Clarence Williams III), and the general test Brenner's own loyalty: is he a soldier or a policeman? ""I'm a soldier, sir!"" says Brenner unhesitatingly, yet almost questioningly.Brenner and Sunhill's investigation comes up against obstacles and obstructions from all manner of people, even to the point of their being ""persuaded"" to desist, and it seems clear that the army hierarchy wants a tight lid to be put on the whole affair. Brenner and Sunhill are undeterred despite their experiences, and soon the most likely suspect, Elisabeth's former CO at PsyOps (Psychological Operations), Colonel Robert Moore (James Woods), is thrown into the slammer. An investigator ought normally to display professional and dispassionate behavior when investigating a murder, yet Brenner makes the whole thing personal, given that Elisabeth herself had actually helped ""Sergeant White"" change a burst tire only a few days before her death. Unfortunately, Brenner makes a procedural blunder that results in another tragic event soon afterwards.The investigation gathers apace thanks to evidence provided (indirectly) by a psychiatrist, Colonel Slesinger (John Beasley), up at the U.S. Military Academy, where a pivotal event in what would be Elisabeth's short life occurred during a night exercise at the end of her sophomore year there. This one event would lead to the events depicted in the movie and serve to explain the attitudes of her fellow officers, including, as it so happens, her father, who has an ulterior motive for his inaction in spite of telling Brenner that he wants justice for his daughter. It also explains what had been the somewhat unsavory side of her private life, as Brenner and Sunhill accidentally discover in the basement of her off-post accommodation.Finally, Brenner confronts the culprit, who explains what exactly happened to Elisabeth, before a rather explosive ending involving an anti personnel mine. As in any good detective story, the perpetrator of the death happens to be the person that one least suspects.Brenner remains true to his profession both as a soldier and as a police officer, and Travolta performs this role with a vigor not normally associated with other roles he has played on screen since the 1970s. Like Sean Connery, John Travolta has taken to performing more ""mature"" roles on screen, leaving his own ""younger"" days behind, and he delivers the goods quite well. Madeleine Stowe is a fine actress, yet one can lament the fact that her role of Sunhill was comparatively minor to Travolta's as Brenner, who appears in practically every single scene, thus not giving her a chance to show off her real talents. Better use could also have been made of Daniel van Bargen in his role as Brenner's civilian nemesis, Chief Yardley, as the movie could have done with some more ""confrontations"" between the two men.The story itself does have most, if not all, of the elements that go together to make a good murder/mystery: the fact that things are not as how they first appear, misguided loyalty, a cover-up, a focus on the ""wrong"" suspect, mistakes that results in lives lost, and an unexpected revelation. A nice (or sad) touch at the end of the movie is the gallery of photos related to the past life of actor Leslie Stefanson, including from childhood, to emphasize just how the life of an ambitious army officer was cruelly taken from her when still young.",4,Divided loyalties for dominant character in murder/mystery,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,5171,"['Risking', 'one', 'life', 'part', 'parcel',

Huh? And then the general himself, loving father of the girl, tells her to buck up and pretend it didn't happen? What? I mean there are some sociopathic guys at the Point, no doubt, but ten sickies in the same class stupid and sadistic enough to do something like that because they are jealous of her? The Army might well try to cover it up, but they sure as hell would want to know who did it. And it gets worse. The lifestyle that the daughter adopts because of this horror and the insane way she seeks to rid herself of the memory is like something dreamed up by a serial killer screen writer on a bad day. And then, after treating us to this nightmare of degrading misogyny, the authors, looking for a saving grace, run some closing words down the screen telling us that now there are over 200,000 women serving proudly in the military, as though perhaps we ought to be thankful for the events depicted in this film for that fact, or maybe they hoped to create the illusion that something like those events actually happened!I'm taking names: the director is Simon West, novel by Nelson DeMille, screenplay by Christopher Bertolini and William Goldman, who, alas, has seen better days. Here's an example of how trite some of the dialogue is. Travola's character is a seasoned veteran who actually fought in Vietnam and now is a warrant officer. He is told by Col. Fowler, another even more seasoned veteran, in dead seriousness that there are three ways to do things, &quot;the right way, the wrong way, and the army way.&quot; Wow, that was original probably a hundred years ago, the sort of wisdom usually handed out by drill instructors to Private E-1's during basic training, not something a colonel might say to a warrant officer. Or, here's another. Travolta, recalling how as a raw recruit in Vietnam, he was by chance comforted by the general who asked where he was from, and when he heard from Boston, told him that the Red Sox had won the day before. The sound track soars and the camera pans to the faces of Col. Fowler and Madeleine Stowe to show us they know how uplifting and inspirational that was for the frightened young man.But don't blame the actors for this travesty. John Travolta, who begins the movie as an undercover sergeant, put a lot of (somewhat stupid) energy into his part, including a funny southern accent, and obviously had a good time. And you can see that James Woods tried hard to infuse some sparkle into the insipid lines and to bring some depth into the shallow and cliche-ridden character he plays. James Cromwell as the general was as ugly as sin and twice as despicable, while Madeleine Stowe looked good enough to ravish. And I thought Leslie Stefanson did a commendable job as the incomprehensible daughter.Bottom line: a new place in hell has been set aside for the purveyors of this sort of sexploitation thriller We'll call it the Griffin Mill Screening Room (after the Machiavellian producer from The Player (1992)), a place in which the producers, the director and the writers are forced to view their concoction until the evaporation of the last black hole in space or the Big Crunch, whichever comes first.",1,Tasteless and stupid,998438400,"08 22, 2001",2001,3396,"['Also', 'offensive', 'sick', 'very', 'far', 'removed', 'reality.I', 'mean', 'ten', 'West', 'Point', 'cadets', 'sadistically', 'gang', 'rape', 'co-ed', 'cadet', 'hours', 'brutally', 'beating', 'up', 'Army', 'balance', 'considerations', 'just', 'forget', 'Huh', 'then', 'general', 'loving', 'father', 'girl', 'buck', 'up', 'pretend', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'What', 'mean', 'are', 'sociopathic', 'guys', 'Point', 'doubt', 'ten', 'sickies', 'same', 'class', 'stupid', 'sadistic', 'enough', 'do', 'something', 'are', 'jealous', 'Army', 'might', 'well', 'try', 'cover', 'up', 'sure', 'hell', 'would', 'want', 'know', 'who', 'did', 'worse', 'lifestyle', 'daughter', 'adopts', 'horror', 'insane', 'way', 'rid', 'herself', 'memory', 'something', 'dreamed', 'up', 'serial', 'killer', 'screen', 'writer', 'bad', 'day', 'then', 'treating', 'nightmare', 'degrading', 'misogyny', 'authors', 'looking', 'saving', 'grace', 'run', 'closing', 'words', 'down', 'screen', 'telling', 'now', 'are', '200,000', 'women', 'serving', 'proudly', 'military', 'perhaps', 'ought', 'be', 'thankful', 'events', 'depicted', 'film', 'fact', 'maybe', 'hoped', 'create', 'illusion', 'something', 'events', 'actually', 'happened', ""'m"", 'taking', 'names', 'director', 'Simon', 'West', 'novel', 'Nelson', 'DeMille', 'screenplay', 'Christopher', 'Bertolini', 'William', 'Goldman', 'who', 'alas', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'Here', 'example', 'how', 'trite', 'dialogue', 'Travola', 'character', 'seasoned', 'veteran', 'who', 'actually', 'fought', 'Vietnam', 'now', 'warrant', 'officer', 'told', 'Col.', 'Fowler', 'even', 'more', 'seasoned', 'veteran', 'dead', 'seriousness', 'are', 'three', 'ways', 'do', 'things', 'quot', 'right', 'way', 'wrong', 'way', 'army', 'way.', 'quot', 'Wow', 'was', 'original', 'probably', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'sort', 'wisdom', 'usually', 'handed', 'out', 'drill', 'instructors', 'Private', 'E-1', 'basic', 'training', 'not', 'something', 'colonel', 'might', 'say', 'warrant', 'officer', 'here', 'Travolta', 'recalling', 'how', 'raw', 'recruit', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'chance', 'comforted', 'general', 'who', 'asked', 'where', 'was', 'when', 'heard', 'Boston', 'told', 'Red', 'Sox', 'had', 'won', 'day', 'sound', 'track', 'soars', 'camera', 'Col.', 'Fowler', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'show', 'know', 'how', 'uplifting', 'inspirational', 'was', 'frightened', 'young', 'man.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'actors', 'travesty', 'John', 'Travolta', 'who', 'movie', 'undercover', 'sergeant', 'put', 'lot', 'somewhat', 'stupid', 'energy', 'part', 'including', 'funny', 'southern', 'accent', 'obviously', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'James', 'Woods', 'tried', 'hard', 'infuse', 'sparkle', 'insipid', 'lines', 'bring', 'depth', 'shallow', 'cliche-ridden', 'character', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'general', 'was', 'as', 'ugly', 'sin', 'twice', 'despicable', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'looked', 'good', 'enough', 'ravish', 'thought', 'Leslie', 'Stefanson', 'did', 'commendable', 'job', 'incomprehensible', 'daughter.Bottom', 'line', 'new', 'place', 'hell', 'been', 'set', 'aside', 'purveyors', 'sort', 'sexploitation', 'thriller', ""'ll"", 'call', 'Griffin', 'Mill', 'Screening', 'Room', 'Machiavellian', 'producer', 'Player', '1992', 'place', 'producers', 'director', 'writers', 'are', 'forced', 'view', 'concoction', 'evaporation', 'last', 'black', 'hole', 'space', 'Big', 'Crunch', 'first']",N/A

John Travolta does a great job of portraying CID agent Paul Brenner. And James Cromwell (who over the years has come a long way from his role as Stretch Cunningham in All in the Family) does an outstanding job of doing the best with a difficult role, the utterly unlikeable general who has done much to psychologically destroy his daughter. On the whole, the acting is topnotch.It is also suspenseful and full of action and never drags. At the same time some of the characters are overdrawn and not all of the plot is plausible.

Further, the film  does have its moments of suspense, but it becomes pretty clear how it will  end - early on.

It is dark, perverse, and has no focus, even though they try to sell on an anti-rape agenda.  As if to say, ""People, stop raping! Enough's enough already!""  I know this terrible crime happens daily in the USA, but really, do we actually believe this was the point of the film as the end credits so eagerly try to portray. I think not.During our little field trip into the General's Daughter, we get to see a gal, who we can't help but feel pitty for, stripped naked at least three times, tied to some tent pegs on two different occasions, and systematically raped in one very long, very drawn out scene. Sound like fun? Sure, if you're Adolph Hitler.As for the rest of us, we had to endure a film in which Travolta, trying so earnestly to sound like a southern gentlemen in this one, is investigating the death of a naked woman, tied down to tent pegs.......Of course, there is a twist in this one. We find out some very odd things about the newly deceased, such as her bizarre fetish for erotic sex. Also, we learn that she once was raped, by a group of fellow soldiers.

It's not but stands as a middle of the road mystery.  As you can read from the synopsis what the story is about, I won't go into too much detail about the movie.  Briefly, John Travolta and Madeline Stowe are warrant officers in the Military Police (CID) and investigate the murder of a female army captain, who happens to be the daughter of a prominent general who is retiring to enter into national politics.  She was found naked and tied spreadeagled to tent posts near a military training area.  The bizarre fact behind this murder is that despite the circumstances she was strangled and there is no evidence of a sexual crime as well.  The two detectives quickly discover that behind the outward appearance of the victim there lies a history of sexual exploits with numerous officers on the base, and a countless number of suspects that would want to have kept this a secret from wives and the general himself.While the story itself is intriguing the characters themselves are not that well developed.  The background is believable but it doesn't draw you in like the best mysteries do.  &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; does a far better job of this.The DVD itself contains some deleted scenes and an alternative ending which I found intriguing.  The scenes while short would have added an element to the movie that was best left on the cutting room floor.  Other DVDs I have rented provided additional scenes that were of no substance but were pretty much just spare footage.  I think this gives you a little more insight into the movie.  The ending isn't a different solution to the mystery just a different take on the final scene after the solution of the mystery.In all, I would say that this isn't worth the purchase but isn't a bad rental.

130274,A152C8GYY25HAH,0792159659,Matthew Horner,"[3, 4]","Let's start with the good news. The General's Daughter is one of the best photographed movies of 1999. The camera setups and the color compositions are so professionally and meticulously crafted that even the transferring of the film to video does not ruin it. It is a pleasure to view such a visual feast.Director Simon West, whose biggest claim to fame so far has been ConAir, does a fine job with the little details that are an important element to film making, whether the audience is aware of these details or not. The editing is superlative, with a ton of jump shots between scenes. These all fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. As for the actors, almost all of them are seasoned professionals. John Travolta, for example, has been in many bad movies, but he has never been bad in a movie. The same can be said of Madeline Stowe, James Cromwell and James Woods.So what's the problem with The General's Daughter? It's all in the script. What is it with Hollywood people? Are most of them illiterate? The script is the engine that drives a film. You could take a great script, shoot the movie in grainy black and white, use novice actors, and the result might still pass muster. If you take a flawed script, don't fix it, spend tens of millions of dollars and hire A-list actors, the result is apt to be something akin to all the king's men trying to save Humpty Dumpty.The worst thing about this movie's script is that it starts with a bang and ends with a whimper. We first met the professional but renegade Warrant Officer Paul Brenner [Travolta] in the process of busting a gun runner. This beginning is exciting and intense, and it helps to define Brenner's character. Meanwhile, things have gone horribly wrong at an Army post in rural Georgia. Wicked things have occurred, and as a result, Captain Elizabeth Campbell has been killed in a most horrible and sensational way. She's not just an Army officer, she is base commander Lt. Gen. Joseph Campbell's [James Cromwell] daughter.When Brenner arrives at the base to investigate, he meets enough suspects to fill a Federal penitentiary. Even General Campbell is not entirely above suspicion. The man has mighty political aspirations, and if his daughter's dirty secrets ever become public, he'll be finished. His right hand man, Col. George Fisher [Clarence Williams III] acts paranoid from the start. The local sheriff's son has had an affair with the victim. Col. Moore [James Woods] is rumored to have been deeply in love with Elizabeth. Brenner quickly learns that what these people really want is a a quick fix or a scapegoat rather than a real investigation.For the first ninety minutes, the movie is an interesting mystery thriller. Our first clue that it may go off track is in the relationship between Brenner and Sara Sunhill [Madeline Stowe], who the Army has partnered with him on the investigation. The first time we see them alone together, we see that the reason they are not friendly is because of an affair they had years ago. Yet this subplot just hangs in the air. We never learn why they broke up. Worse, there is no clue as to whether they plan to get back together. It makes the knowledge of the affair pointless to the story. In much the same way, the end of the movie more or less disintegrates. To me, a great mystery is one in which the culprit is not the one you suspected, but still someone you realize you should have paid attention to.

In fact even my most liberal friend thought some nutcase must have written this one!I can say that yes there's crime in the military and rapes and such but this one seems to have a motive of just being antimilitary instead of telling a good story about bad people in the military which is acceptable.  This is almost as bad as 'the valley of elah' and like that one you had excellent actors lost in a movie driven by a underlying idea of smearing rathering than telling a story.

130280,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,0792159659,Michael J. Mazza,"[1, 2]","In ""The General's Daughter,"" directed by Simon West, John Travolta plays Warrant Officer Paul Brenner, an Army investigator. He and a fellow officer (Madeleine Stowe) team up to investigate a high profile murder on an Army base. Their quest for the truth leads them into some twisted pathways of sex, power, and secrecy.This film is a genuinely gripping crime thriller. Director West maintains effective tension, and the performances are outstanding. Travolta brings an appealing mix of strength and sensitivity to his soldier-cop, and Stowe is also wholly credible as his sharp-minded partner. The supporting cast is stellar, but I was particularly impressed by James Woods' raw-nerve performance as an army officer who may be hiding a secret.The one aspect of the film that doesn't work is the brief romantic bickering of the two main characters; to me it was out of place and merely detracted from the main story. What I did find compelling was the film's effective portrayal of the military as a complex subculture with its own history and customs.Be warned: the film does not portray the U.S. Army in the best light, and many will be disturbed, and even offended, by some of the film's ideas and images.

130281,A2K53J3MLTXFB3,0792159659,miramaxfan,"[6, 9]","In Short: Enjoyable special edition of the Travolta hit from this past Summer. The commentary track is a dissapointment, though.The Movie:I actually liked director Simon West's first film, the action thriller  &quot;Con Air&quot;. It certainly wasn't anything that was Oscar-worthy,  but it had a visual style that I found interesting, and it certainly kept  with the &quot;Michael Bay&quot; style that directors that work with  producer Jerry Bruckheimer(&quot;Armageddon&quot;) are known to have mass  quantities of.John Travolta stars in this film (based on the bestselling  novel) as millitary investigator Paul Brenner, who we first meet as he's  working undercover, using a very funny Southern accent while trying to  catch some nasty arms dealers. He meets Captain Elizabeth Campbell one  night while trying to fix a flat tire. Soon though, he finds himself  investigating her murder after her body is found on the army base. More is  soon revealed as the woman is revealed to be the daughter of the  General(James Cromwell). Finding himself with a new partner in his old  girlfriend, Sarah Sunderland(Madeline Stowe), the two interview many of the  base's occupants, including another suspicious offer (James Woods), and  find that there's more to the woman's past than they first  thought.Although not all of the characters are terribly well-developed  (especially Stowe's), they generally do a fine job with the roles they're  given. Travolta especially gives another very strong and actually, quite  smart performance coming after another excellent job in &quot;A Civil  Action&quot;. Travolta also has some fine battles of conversation versus  Wood's character that are some of the movie's highlights.The movie does  an above average job of presenting average material. It's material that's  not terribly new or original, but the performances are good, and as I said  before, West (along with cinematographer Peter Menzies, Jr., who also  filmed such movies as &quot;Die Hard 3&quot; and &quot;Hard Rain&quot;) is  able to build an intensely watchable visual style. Pace is generally good,  but sometimes the movie does get a little slow. &quot;The General's  Daughter&quot; is one of those films where the performances and direction  help to make otherwise so-so material entertaining.The DVDVIDEO:  Although this isn't quite the best disc I've seen from Paramount in terms  of image quality, it's certainly still a very excellent effort. With the  exception of a few small problems, this is a really strong, really  beautiful looking transfer. The 2.35:1 anamorphic image contains very  strong, bold colors that look excellent on this DVD, and detail is  excellent throughout. The image captures the sort of sun-soaked, warm feel  of the scenes very well. Flesh tones are natural and accurate with no  problems. Contrast is very good as well.Images remain well defined and  pleasingly bright throughout, and even the night scenes or dimly lit scenes  in the movie contain a good amount of detail. The only flaw that I noticed  with this image was the occasional instance of shimmering, although these  instances were not terribly distracting. Aside from a few small flaws,  &quot;The General's Daughter&quot; is another example of how Paramount has  turned around since earlier this year and has really been doing  consistently strong work on each of their DVD efforts.  SOUND Although  many scenes in the &quot;General's Daughter&quot; revolve around intense  scenes of dialogue, there is also a fine helping of action, and these  scenes give the sound mix a chance to do some strong work. Most of the  action scenes make effective use of the surrounds and make for a highly  enveloping and highly enjoyable experience. Excellent score by Carter  Burwell(&quot;Three Kings&quot;, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;) sounds  rich and clear and dialogue has no problems either, coming through crystal  clear.MENUS:: Heavily animated main menus take the viewer nicely into  the movie. There is also animation when you make a choice on the main  menu.EXTRAS:  Commentary: This is a commentary track from director Simon  West. The commentary does sound very much like the director is reading  something that he's written while watching the film (which &quot;Mrs.  Doubtfire&quot; director Chris Columbus also did for the commentary on that  film), although I'm not sure that this is the case. Still, it's a somewhat  interesting commentary track at times, with West pointing out a lot of the  details of the production, with notes that I found quite interesting, such  as discussion towards the begining of the track about how West and  cinematographer Peter Menzies, Jr. made their choices for the style of  lighting. West also touches again a couple of times on the visual style  that he and Menzies were able to achieve on this picture.I say it's a  dissapointing commentary though (and I don't say that about too many  commentaries), because although West does provide some interesting details  when he speaks, it becomes apparent early on in this track that this is  going to be one of those commentaries that contain its fair share of pauses  between discussion. Although some sections of the commentary contain a  fairly decent amount of discussion, there were some pauses during this talk  that were long enough to make me wonder if the commentary was still going  on, which I found dissapointing. It seemed as if the pauses became more  frequent as the track went on.Other things that West touches on during  the discussion are his thoughts on the various actors as well as how some  of the effects were done. He also offers a number of entertaining and  informative stories about what went on during the filming of certain scenes  throughout. What became a little annoying was the fact that West falls back  occasionally on simply commenting on what's going on on-screen, and that  gets a little dull. Don't get me wrong: I appreciate greatly that Paramount  put a commentary track as an addition to this DVD, but really, it's  definitely not one of the better commentaries I've heard this  year.Deleted Scenes: These are 5 deleted scenes that are 10 minutes in  length.Two make up the romantic element between John Travolta and Madeline  Stowe's characters. Director Simon West decided that this part of the story  should not be included in the final film, and before the scenes begin, we  hear him tell why. The others are fairly interesting additions showing more  of Travolta's investigation. The 2nd Stowe/Travolta scene is an alternate  ending to the film.Behind-The-Scenes Featurette: More of a  &quot;documentary&quot;, I'd say: this is a 20 minute  &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; look at the making of this movie. The usual  elements are of course included: we get interviews with the majority of the  cast as well as director Simon West. There are some interesting details  offered about the production, such as the intense heat and conditions that  had to be contended with during filming as well as a look at some of the  sets that had to be built for this movie. We also get a sneak peek at some  of the special props that were brought in for this picture. I really liked  a lot of how this documentary takes the viewer for a  &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; look at how a lot of the filming was done,  with sequences that show the various cameras used at work.Of course,  there are also talks about the characters and the relationships that they  have, and interviews with the actors generally fill out the details on who  they play and what they do. A very nicely done documentary and a fine  addition to the DVD.Trailers: The teaser and theatrical trailers are  included.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Final Thoughts The movie isn't too bad, and the image/sound quality is  very enjoyable, but the commentary track I felt was dissapointing. The  documentary and the deleted scenes do make nice additions, though. Worth a  look as a rental.",4,"Decent movie, but enjoyable DVD edition",946166400,"12 26, 1999",1999,8021,"['Short', 'Enjoyable', 'special', 'edition', 'Travolta', 'hit', 'past', 'Summer',

At least this one has a plot, a storyline, and moves things along.  Many of the overlong, tedious productions that Hollywood and its foreign rivals have been belching out for the past 20 years do none of these things.  This one has no long dreary interludes, and every scene is relevant to the story.  The main flaw in this film, in fact, is its downbeat tone.  This is not a happy story, and the film utterly fails to inject any lightheartedness into the storyline, which is something DeMille did very successfully in the novel, by the way.The soundtrack of this film is quite good.

Zwick,"[6, 11]","Despite high powered talent both in front of and behind the camera, &quot;The General's Daughter&quot; emerges as a tepid, run-of-the-mill murder mystery set on a deep South army base. The murder victim is the (to  put it politely) sexually loose daughter of the camp's highly distinguished  general; Travolta portrays the investigator, torn between loyalty to the  military and to his civilian duties, whose job it is to unravel the mystery  of her bizarre death.Though based on true events, the film's screenplay  fails to develop a particularly compelling or surprising story, settling  instead for a gallery of essentially stereotypical characters. We have, for  instance, the cynical, but essentially decent tough guy investigator, the  hard-as-nails female helpmate, who, of course, has shared a failed romantic  past with the hero, and the by-the-rules-at-all-costs military father,  willing to sacrifice his daughter's life on the altar of doing what's best  for the institution. In addition, the film lines up the usual array of red  herrings, false leads, and strawmen suspects that Travolta's character must  bat away before the final solution is revealed. That resolution comes in  the form of a ludicrous, barely credible scene in which the guilty person,  as always, pointlessly explains to the investigators every detail  concerning the execution of the crime.Given nothing in the way of fully  developed or fleshed out characters to portray, the actors are left to  essentially sleepwalk through their roles. It is obvious none of their  hearts are in these dull proceedings. Travolta needs perhaps to begin  challenging himself a bit more in more demanding roles and stop settling  for such routine assignments as the one he has found in &quot;The General's  Daughter&quot;.",2,ho-hum melodrama,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,1791,"['high', 'powered', 'talent', 'front', 'camera', 'quot', 'General', 'Daughter', 'quot', 'tepid', 'run-of-the-mill', 'murder', 'mystery', 'set', 'deep', 'South', 'army', 'base', 'murder', 'victim', 'put', 'politely', 'sexually', 'loose', 'daughter', 'camp', 'highly', 'distinguished', 'general', 'Travolta', 'investigator', 'torn', 'loyalty', 'military', 'civilian', 'duties', 'job', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'bizarre', 'death.Though', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'film', 'screenplay', 'develop', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'surprising', 'story', 'settling', 'instead', 'gallery', 'essentially', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'have', 'instance', 'cynical', 'essentially', 'decent', 'tough', 'guy', 'investigator', 'hard-as-nails', 'female', 'helpmate', 'who', 'course', 'shared', 'failed', 'romantic', 'past', 'hero', 'by-the-rules-at-all-costs', 'military', 'father', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'daughter', 'life', 'altar', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'institution', 'addition', 'film', 'lines', 'usual', 'array', 'red', 'herrings', 'false', 'leads', 'strawmen', 'Travolta', 'character', 'must', 'bat', 'away', 'final', 'solution', 'revealed', 'resolution', 'form', 'ludicrous', 'barely', 'credible', 'scene', 'guilty', 'person', 'always', 'pointlessly', 'investigators', 'detail', 'concerning', 'execution', 'crime.Given', 'nothing', 'way', 'fully', 'developed', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'portray', 'actors', 'are', 'left', 'essentially', 'sleepwalk', 'roles', 'obvious', 'none', 'hearts', 'are', 'dull', 'proceedings', 'Travolta', 'perhaps', 'begin', 'challenging', 'bit', 'more', 'more', 'demanding', 'roles', 'stop', 'settling', 'such', 'routine', 'assignments', 'one', 'found', 'quot', 'General', 'Daughter', 'quot']",N/A

130296,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0792159659,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 1]","John Travolta is the only thing enjoyable in this otherwise convaluted mystery centering on a politically ambitious army general's daughter'a brutal. When Travolta's charachter is asked to account for his own whereabouts at the time of the murder, Travolta - who'd been in a shootout while working on another case - explains he was too busy trying to kill somebody else. Unfortunately, the story is weighed down by every possible contrivance - mostly centering around the victim's sexual history. Becuae the victim was promiscuous, just about every man on base is a suspect.  Also on the loose is a mysterious figure who's probably the murderer and soon starts taking pot-shots at our investigators.  The script takes its plot devices way too seriously, soon squandering some major firepower. James Woods' charachter, a weasel psych-warfare expert, never gets the chance to strut wicked, and soon he's gone. With his departure, Travolta is forced to play-off a minor army of toy soldiers, plastic pieces with only a vague semblance of believable people. It's hard to imagine anybody giving these officers so much as KP, let alone command of an armored division. Staggeringly pleased with itself, the script never really developes its mystery or remotely clever ways to solve it. With clues just falling into Travolta's lap, the film undermines the detective instinct that Travolta's charachter needs to solve the biggest mystery of all - why watch this movie?",2,Should be Courtmartialed,972604800,"10 27, 2000",2000,1459,"['John', 'Travolta', 'only', 'thing', 'enjoyable', 'otherwise', 'convaluted', 'mystery', 'centering', 'politically', 'ambitious', 'general', 'daughter', 'brutal', 'When', 'Travolta', 'charachter', 'asked', 'account', 'own', 'whereabouts', 'time', 'murder', 'Travolta', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'shootout', 'working', 'case', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'kill', 'somebody', 'else', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'weighed', 'down', 'possible', 'contrivance', 'mostly', 'centering', 'victim', 'sexual', 'history', 'victim', 'was', 'promiscuous', 'just', 'man', 'base', 'suspect', 'Also', 'loose', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'who', 'probably', 'murderer', 'soon', 'starts', 'taking', 'pot-shots', 'investigators', 'script', 'plot', 'devices', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'soon', 'squandering', 'major', 'firepower', 'James', 'Woods', 'charachter', 'weasel', 'psych-warfare', 'expert', 'never', 'chance', 'strut', 'wicked', 'soon', 'gone', 'departure', 'Travolta', 'forced', 'play-off', 'minor', 'army', 'toy', 'soldiers', 'plastic', 'pieces', 'only', 'vague', 'semblance', 'believable', 'people', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anybody', 'giving', 'officers', 'so', 'much', 'KP', 'let', 'alone', 'command', 'armored', 'division', 'Staggeringly', 'pleased', 'script', 'never', 'really', 'mystery', 'remotely', 'clever', 'ways', 'solve', 'clues', 'just', 'falling', 'Travolta', 'lap', 'film', 'detective', 'instinct', 'Travolta', 'charachter', 'solve', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'why', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

Jack Nicholson, with his calm demeanor says nonchalantly, &quot;You can't handle the truth.&quot; That moment will live in our pop culture for years to come. It is what good  writing is all about. In the pivotal moment of this movie, the big bad  general's assistant tells Travolta, &quot;You'd better start thinking about  your career.&quot; Travolta, with eyes bulging and veins throbbing in his  neck, through gritted teeth, delivers that magic line for the whole movie,  &quot;You'd better start thiking about yours!&quot; And everyone watching  says, &quot;Huh? Did I miss something?&quot;  Why not just do his best Pee  Wee Herman and say, &quot;I know you are, but what am I?&quot;  If you  think that line is lackluster, then watch the rest of the movie. After  setting the stage for a decent conspiracy, it continually lets the viewer  down, leading up to a dull climax and a cliche ending.Not to say it is  without bright spots. James Cromwell always shines and here it is no  different. He is the general, grieving over his daughter, yet giving off  the impression that maybe he is hiding something. Even brighter is James  Woods. Playing a military shrink with an attitude, he comes off as brass,  pompous, challenging, and--believe it or not--likeable. If the rest of this  movie were any better, the Academy just might think supporting actor nod,  but, alas, his bright performance is dulled by the rest of this flop.  Travolta is subpar, and Stowe is as flat as she's ever been, which is  plains-of- Kansas-kind-of flat.The plot itself, as I have said is set up  decent enough. The general's daughter, herself an outstanding soldier, is  found killed, bound and gagged on base. Rape and murder, or a tangled web  of conspiracy that could possibly indict the big kahunas? I'll leave it to  you to guess which one. The plot unfolds itself, dug up by Travolta and  Stowe's two dimensonal characters, who have some sort of love/hate tension  thing going which never gets fully developed (which is alright because no  one gives a damn about either of them anyway). During two plus hours of  tediousness, the two overturn clues, bend the rules (certainly a  requirement of all detectives nowadays, isn't it?), and play hardball in an  effort to solve the murder. And then finally, the veiwer gets some respite  as they roll the credits.If you're looking for your average  run-of-the-mill, carbon-copy, conspiracy murder mystery, then this is your  movie. However, if you'd like a bit of thought and originality, then you  might want to pass it up on the rental shelves.My verdict: Travolta had  better start thinking about his career",2,General's Daughter Falls Flat,947894400,"01 15, 2000",2000,2690,"['quot', 'want', 'truth', 'quot', 'yells', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'calm', 'demeanor', 'nonchalantly', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'truth.', 'quot', 'moment', 'will', 'live', 'pop', 'culture', 'years', 'come', 'what', 'good', 'writing', 'about', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'movie', 'big', 'bad', 'general', 'assistant', 'Travolta', 'quot', ""'d"", 'better', 'start', 'thinking', 'career.', 'quot', 'Travolta', 'eyes', 'bulging', 'veins', 'throbbing', 'neck', 'gritted', 'teeth', 'delivers', 'magic', 'line', 'whole', 'movie', 'quot', ""'d"", 'better', 'start', 'thiking', 'yours', 'quot', 'everyone', 'watching', 'quot', 'Huh', 'Did', 'miss', 'something', 'quot', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'do', 'best', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Herman', 'say', 'quot', 'know', 'are', 'what', 'am', 'quot', 'think', 'line', 'lackluster', 'then', 'watch', 'rest', 'movie', 'setting', 'stage', 'decent', 'conspiracy', 'continually', 'viewer', 'down', 'leading', 'up', 'dull', 'climax', 'cliche', 'ending.Not', 'say', 'bright', 'spots', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'always', 'shines', 'here', 'different', 'general', 'grieving', 'daughter', 'yet', 'giving', 'off', 'impression', 'maybe', 'hiding', 'something', 'Even', 'brighter', 'James', 'Woods', 'Playing', 'military', 'shrink', 'attitude', 'off', 'brass', 'pompous', 'challenging', 'believe', 'not', 'likeable', 'rest', 'movie', 'were', 'better', 'Academy', 'just', 'might', 'think', 'supporting', 'actor', 'nod', 'alas', 'bright', 'performance', 'dulled', 'rest', 'flop', 'Travolta', 'subpar', 'Stowe', 'as', 'flat', 'ever', 'been', 'plains-of-', 'Kansas-kind-of', 'flat.The', 'plot', 'have', 'said', 'set', 'up', 'decent', 'enough', 'general', 'daughter', 'outstanding', 'soldier', 'found', 'killed', 'bound', 'gagged', 'base', 'Rape', 'murder', 'tangled', 'web', 'conspiracy', 'could', 'possibly', 'indict', 'big', 'kahunas', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'guess', 'one', 'plot', 'dug', 'up', 'Travolta', 'Stowe', 'two', 'dimensonal', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'sort', 'love/hate', 'tension', 'thing', 'going', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'alright', 'one', 'damn', 'anyway', 'two', 'hours', 'tediousness', 'two', 'overturn', 'clues', 'bend', 'rules', 'certainly', 'requirement', 'detectives', 'nowadays', ""n't"", 'play', 'hardball', 'effort', 'solve', 'murder', 'then', 'finally', 'veiwer', 'respite', 'roll', 'credits.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'average', 'run-of-the-mill', 'carbon-copy', 'conspiracy', 'murder', 'mystery', 'then', 'movie', 'However', ""'d"", 'like', 'bit', 'thought', 'originality', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'pass', 'up', 'rental', 'shelves.My', 'verdict', 'Travolta', 'had', 'better', 'start', 'thinking', 'career']",N/A

The action keeps rolling along and you won't find yourself bored for  one second. John Travolta does a very good job as a CID Officer and  Madeleine Stowe always amazes me with her beauty and grace.The biggest  qualm I have with this flick is with Elizabeth Cambell (the General's  Daughter). Here is a young woman who has been savagely gang raped. Her  father, the General, refuses to press any charges and tells her to  &quot;forget about it&quot; as it would destroy the Naval Academy. She  winds up becoming filled with self torment, finding herself unable to  fulfill any relationship with a young man as her rape has caused tremendous  psychological damage. She sleeps with what seems to be almost half of the  men stationed in camp.When we see Leslie Stefanson (Elizabeth Cambell,  the General's Daughter) changing Paul Brenner's (John Travolta) flat tire  at the beginning of the movie we see a young, vibrant, very beautiful,  bubbly, even perky young woman. When we see her afterwards she continues to  act this this way, as if she were the happiest person in the world.Now,  if you were hiding dark secrets like being gang raped and were having sex  with half the members of your camp, and happened to also be the General's  Daughter, and was so tormented, that you were on the verge of spilling the  beans to the entire world, wouldn't it be difficult to behave so happy and  so perky?I think Gina Gershon would have done a better job. She has  kinda of a dark, sexy, beautiful, mystical, naughty kind of disposition.  And if called upon, she could probably act like she was living as if she  were hiding something.I don't know whether or not to blame Leslie  Stefanson or the director as he should certainly have seen that she wasn't  playing the part right. In any case, in my humble opinion, it's a major  oversight. You don't have happy, perky, people, who are supposed to be  hiding dark, deep, secrets.

Confidential.  Anything and  everything is shown in this film, from sadmasicism, to rape, to a woman  (The General's Daughter) sprawled out for all too see on the ground.  The  story plays out fairly well the first half, The General (played by James  Cromwell) has ignored his daughters rape for years, so that he can move  ahead in the military.  John Travolta comes in to investigate something,  does anyone know?

130309,AU5SQBPSNOIM,0792159659,"Vanissa W. Chan ""vandelist""","[2, 4]","I viewed this film for the second time tonight, and will admit that I did not enjoy it as much as I did the first time.  There are more than a few flaws in the screenwriting and possibly even directing that comes short of making the film complete and satisfying.  However, I felt the message was somewhat provoking and atleast well-intentioned.Most people who hated this movie seem to think that this film was very &quot;anti-military.&quot;  Being that I'm not in the military myself (a few of my friends are), my attention was not focused on how sensitively the film dealt with the topic.  I notice now after the second showing that a few lines here and there seemed to hint towards anti-military sentiments.  However, whether it be the military, the government, the Church, the education system, we cannot deny that corruption is possible in any standing institution.Gang-rape out of jealousy?  A general who covers up the crime in efforts to save the face of West Point?  Perhaps they shouldn't have used so directly the name of West Point and instead, referred to it as some general academy.  I don't think gang-rape out of jealousy is impossible and farfetched.  Rape is a crime of hate and sexism in the military setting is very present.  One of my bestfriends is in the third highest command here at Virginia Tech with the Corps Cadets and she is constantly competing with the other men, and constantly scrutinized in their presence.  Being a female in the military is NOT easy, and resentment between students, especially between sexes, is not all that unlikely.As for the general covering up the crime -- why is that unrealistic?  If the media jumped all over the rape case, what female would feel safe applying to an institution where they are potential victims?  No university, whether military or civilian wants to have their rapes publicized.  It is bad for the name of the university and bad for their business.  For the general to have chosen to keep quiet about the rape of his daughter was not the moral decision but an easy way out for this predicament.And what are the responses from the child who has just been denied justice by her own father?  While I can't say I condone the acts she committed in order to capture her father's attention, I can say that I understand the psychology of a rape victim.  Refusing to bring her perpetrators to justice, and denying that the rape even happened told the daughter that she not only all alone in her situation, but that she was worthless and insignificant in her father's eyes.  Having to return to school and constantly facing the fear of her &quot;faceless&quot; perpetrators must have also been traumatizing.  This experience alone is enough to carve a wound so deep into a person's soul that revenge seems to be the only path of fulfillment.A few major flaws in the film were the re-creation of the rape and who actually murdered her.  Timothy Hutton's character lacked depth and the screenwriting failed to develop a strong tie between the victim and perpetrator, leaving the audience to think, &quot;Wait a minute, who is this guy and WHY did he kill her?&quot;  Their story seemed insignificant to the entire picture.  As for the re-creation of the rape, why wasn't More there to watch if anything badly happened to her?  Was he just expecting that her own father would untie her?  What if he decided that he would not, and she was left all alone out there all night long?  Didn't she have a better back up plan than that?  Furthermore, I was appalled that none of the men who saw her out there tried to cover her body when immediately saw her (it just appears psychologically inaccurate).  I mean, isn't that a person's first instinct, to cover up someone's exposed body?  Another flaw is the fact that More was the last to find out about Elizabeth's murder.  If he had been the one to help her stage the scene, why wasn't he available for her the rest of the night incase she should want to be released from that humiliating position?  Some of this was just behaviorally inaccurate.James Cromwell reminded me of his Captain role in LA Confidential.  John Travolta, I personally thought, was good and entertaining (perhaps a little too gutsy, but hey, it's Hollywood).  Madeleine Stowe could have been used more, and definitely Hutton's character, as mentioned before, was underdeveloped (and too underdeveloped to be the killer, in my opinion).All in all, a pretty decent film about the psychological warfare that occurs between a parent and a child, and how it can explode and branch out into many evils just because the parent was cause for deficits in the child.",4,Youch!

130311,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0792159659,Wuchak,"[1, 2]","1999's ""The General's Daughter"" takes place at and around a coastal Georgia military base. John Travolta plays an Army investigator who teams up with Madeleine Stowe, a woman he once had an affair with (yeah right), to solve the ugly murder of the daughter of the commanding officer, herself a captain.Whether you like Travolta or not, there's no denying his star power. He easily carries this film as the protagonist from beginning to end. The real cast highlight for me, however, is the stunning Madeleine Stowe (remember her from 1992's excellent ""Last of the Mohicans""?). Throughout most of the film Madeleine wears a white sleeveless shirt and form-fitting tan-ish slacks; she's just spellbinding.The film is rated R and for good reason. There are numerous scenes of a naked woman staked out spread-eagled, both alive and dead. Besides murder, the picture features overt elements of S & M and gang rape. This may turn some potential viewers away, but the film is worth sticking with if you can brace yourself for the sordid aspects. How so? Because ""The General's Daughter"" powerfully shows that sexual abuse must be addressed and not shoved under the rug. Inner wounds must be properly bound and healed, not dismissed with a casual shrug.My wife and I recently saw a fascinating documentary on prostitutes. I never could understand how a woman could have sexual relations (especially oral sex) with some dirty, smelly sleazebag for money. It's gag-inducing to me. With one exception every prostitute interviewed confessed to being sexually abused while growing up. The abuse was never properly addressed and, consequently, no real inner-healing could take place. The abuse literally damned the women to a sordid life of self-loathing and self-destruction. My heart goes out to them!The sleazy sexual elements are so in-your-face in ""The General's Daughter"" that it's hard to look past it to the meat of the story. The unaddressed sexual abuse of the General's daughter leads to an ultra-promiscuous and deviant lifestyle, resulting -- of course -- in misery and (ultimately) destruction.Travolta's character briefly knew the general's daughter before her murder. What compels him to solve the murder and enact justice & vengeance on the direct and indirect perpetrators (aside from the fact that it's his job) is that he clearly saw a genuine gleam of beauty and life in her. Amazon reviewer Steven Quan understandably objects that, if she was as horribly abused as depicted in the story, she wouldn't be so vibrant and perky. But, nevertheless, this vibrancy and inner beauty is authentic. Travolta knows it because he experienced it. It's a glimpse of who she really was or could be, a glimmer of her potential as a woman and a human being. True, most of it may merely be a public veneer, an act she hides behind, but the flimsy root is REAL. Unfortunately it's overshadowed by her raw torment within, inner pain so great that it compels her to ridiculously radical actions.When Travolta finally figures out what and who destroyed the inner beauty and potential of this young woman his righteous anger is potent and palpable.I heard the story was loosely based on real-life events, but can't verify it.The picture was filmed on location in coastal Georgia, around Savannah. There's also a breathtaking shot of West Point, NY, where a small portion of the story takes place.CONCLUSION: ""The General's Daughter"" is more than just a meaningless detective mystery/thriller. It's thought-provoking and delivers a powerful message. Some won't get it. Some are unable to get it. Others can't get past the sleazy elements. For the rest of us it's a worthwhile, heavy and potent piece of filmmaking. Travolta is at his charismatic best and Madeleine Stowe is spellbinding. I'd give it a higher rating, but the implausible Hollywoodisms stack-up toward the end and the revelation of the murderer and aftermath is weak.GRADE: B+",4,"Sordid, but worthwhile and potent (for some)",1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,3925,"['1999', 'General', 'Daughter', 'place', 'coastal', 'Georgia', 'military', 'base', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Army', 'investigator', 'who', 'up', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'woman', 'once', 'had', 'affair', 'yeah', 'right', 'solve', 'ugly', 'murder', 'daughter', 'commanding', 'officer', 'captain.Whether', 'Travolta', 'not', 'denying', 'star', 'power', 'easily', 'film', 'protagonist', 'beginning', 'end', 'real', 'cast', 'highlight', 'however', 'stunning', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'remember', '1992', 'excellent', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'most', 'film', 'Madeleine', 'white', 'sleeveless', 'shirt', 'form-fitting', 'tan-ish', 'slacks', 'just', 'spellbinding.The', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'good', 'reason', 'are', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'naked', 'woman', 'staked', 'out', 'spread-eagled', 'alive', 'dead', 'murder', 'picture', 'overt', 'elements', 'S', 'M', 'gang', 'rape', 'may', 'turn', 'potential', 'viewers', 'away', 'film', 'worth', 'sticking', 'can', 'brace', 'sordid', 'aspects', 'How', 'so', 'General', 'Daughter', 'powerfully', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'must', 'be', 'addressed', 'not', 'shoved', 'rug', 'Inner', 'must', 'be', 'properly', 'bound', 'healed', 'not', 'dismissed', 'casual', 'shrug.My', 'wife', 'recently', 'saw', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'prostitutes', 'never', 'could', 'understand', 'how', 'woman', 'could', 'have', 'sexual', 'relations', 'especially', 'oral', 'sex', 'dirty', 'smelly', 'sleazebag', 'money', 'gag-inducing', 'one', 'exception', 'prostitute', 'interviewed', 'confessed', 'being', 'sexually', 'abused', 'growing', 'up', 'abuse', 'was', 'never', 'properly', 'addressed', 'consequently', 'real', 'inner-healing', 'could', 'take', 'place', 'abuse', 'literally', 'damned', 'women', 'sordid', 'life', 'self-loathing', 'self-destruction', 'heart', 'out', 'sleazy', 'sexual', 'elements', 'are', 'so', 'in-your-face', 'General', 'Daughter', 'hard', 'look', 'meat', 'story', 'unaddressed', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'General', 'daughter', 'ultra-promiscuous', 'deviant', 'lifestyle', 'resulting', 'course', 'misery', 'ultimately', 'destruction.Travolta', 'character', 'briefly', 'knew', 'general', 'daughter', 'murder', 'What', 'compels', 'solve', 'murder', 'enact', 'justice', 'vengeance', 'direct', 'indirect', 'perpetrators', 'aside', 'fact', 'job', 'clearly', 'saw', 'genuine', 'gleam', 'beauty', 'life', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'Steven', 'Quan', 'understandably', 'was', 'horribly', 'abused', 'depicted', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'vibrant', 'perky', 'nevertheless', 'vibrancy', 'inner', 'beauty', 'authentic', 'Travolta', 'experienced', 'glimpse', 'who', 'really', 'was', 'could', 'be', 'glimmer', 'potential', 'woman', 'human', 'being', 'True', 'most', 'may', 'merely', 'be', 'public', 'veneer', 'act', 'flimsy', 'root', 'REAL', 'overshadowed', 'raw', 'torment', 'inner', 'pain', 'so', 'great', 'ridiculously', 'radical', 'actions.When', 'Travolta', 'finally', 'out', 'what', 'who', 'destroyed', 'inner', 'beauty', 'potential', 'young', 'woman', 'righteous', 'anger', 'potent', 'palpable.I', 'heard', 'story', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'real-life', 'events', 'ca', ""n't"", 'verify', 'it.The', 'picture', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'coastal', 'Georgia', 'Savannah', 'also', 'breathtaking', 'shot', 'West', 'Point', 'NY', 'where', 'small', 'portion', 'story', 'place.CONCLUSION', 'General', 'Daughter', 'more', 'just', 'meaningless', 'detective', 'mystery/thriller', 'thought-provoking', 'powerful', 'message', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'are', 'unable', 'get', 'Others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'sleazy', 'elements', 'rest', 'worthwhile', 'heavy', 'potent', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'Travolta', 'charismatic', 'best', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'spellbinding', ""'d"", 'give', 'higher', 'rating', 'implausible', 'Hollywoodisms', 'stack-up', 'end', 'revelation', 'murderer', 'aftermath', 'weak.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A
