425080,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6304481764,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL YEN (1933) reunited director Frank Capra and his ""Miracle Woman"" leading lady Barbara Stanwyck for an exotic Chinese adventure romp, loaded with subtext and erotic intrigue.Prim missionary Megan Davis (Barbara Stanwyck) is attacked and left for dead during an attempt to save some children from a destroyed orphanage in Shanghai during a civil uprising.  She's saved from certain death by notorious warlord General Yen (Nils Asther) and smuggled away to his palace.  There, she becomes embroiled in the various intrigues of his court.The film is a noteworthy precursor to Frank Capra's subsequent 1937 picture ""Lost Horizon"", sharing a common milieu.  One of the last major pre-codes, GENERAL YEN stirred would-be censors with it's depiction of a possible *gasp* interracial romance between Megan and her captor.  It also features striking set designs and one of the most audacious dream sequences you'll ever have the pleasure of seeing.  Sadly, GENERAL YEN was a notorious flop, possibly because of some of the elements I've just outlined.  Depression era audiences loved escapism, yet they also wanted movies they could readily relate to, and this film didn't quite operate on either of those levels.  It's still one heck of a ride, though!THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL YEN is currently only available in the United Kingdom on DVD as part of a Barbara Stanwyck boxset that also boasts ""The Miracle Woman"", ""All I Desire"", ""Golden Boy"", ""The Lady Eve"" and ""Double Indemnity"".",4,fascinating Capra/Stanwyck adventure,1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,1499,"['BITTER', 'TEA', 'OF', 'GENERAL', 'YEN', '1933', 'reunited', 'director', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Miracle', 'Woman', 'leading', 'lady', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'exotic', 'Chinese', 'adventure', 'romp', 'loaded', 'subtext', 'erotic', 'intrigue.Prim', 'missionary', 'Megan', 'Davis', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'attacked', 'left', 'dead', 'attempt', 'save', 'children', 'destroyed', 'orphanage', 'Shanghai', 'civil', 'uprising', 'saved', 'certain', 'death', 'notorious', 'warlord', 'General', 'Yen', 'Nils', 'Asther', 'smuggled', 'away', 'palace', 'embroiled', 'various', 'intrigues', 'court.The', 'film', 'noteworthy', 'precursor', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'subsequent', '1937', 'picture', 'Lost', 'Horizon', 'sharing', 'common', 'milieu', 'One', 'last', 'major', 'pre-codes', 'GENERAL', 'YEN', 'stirred', 'would-be', 'censors', 'depiction', 'possible', '*gasp*', 'interracial', 'romance', 'Megan', 'captor', 'also', 'striking', 'set', 'designs', 'one', 'most', 'audacious', 'dream', 'sequences', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'have', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Sadly', 'GENERAL', 'YEN', 'was', 'notorious', 'flop', 'possibly', 'elements', ""'ve"", 'just', 'outlined', 'Depression', 'era', 'audiences', 'loved', 'escapism', 'yet', 'also', 'wanted', 'movies', 'could', 'readily', 'relate', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'operate', 'levels', 'still', 'one', 'heck', 'ride', 'BITTER', 'TEA', 'OF', 'GENERAL', 'YEN', 'currently', 'only', 'available', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'DVD', 'part', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'boxset', 'also', 'Miracle', 'Woman', 'Desire', 'Golden', 'Boy', 'Lady', 'Eve', 'Double', 'Indemnity']",Bitter Tea of General Yen VHS
425081,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,6304481764,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[1, 1]","Warning! These comments reveal the end of the movie!""Bitter Tea"" opens, as all perverse films should, at a missionary party. It's the Chinese Civil War. A bunch of white Americans are celebrating in an American-style living room. China looms outside, in the dark. There are a couple of blank-faced Chinese domestic servants; Capra uses their faces to full effect.The missionaries are celebrating the anticipated arrival of Megan Davis (Barbara Stanwyck), the fianc&eacute;e of Dr. Robert Strike. She's from a fine, old Puritan family and she has never been to China before.Megan Davis arrives, but her paths cross with a callous Chinese warlord, General Yen (Nils Asther). In a crowd, Megan is hit on the head by a disgruntled coolie. She passes out. Yen kidnaps Megan as his sexual hostage. He drugs her and transports her via his own troop train. His stated goal is to ""convert a missionary.""Yen never uses force on Megan; in fact he never touches her until a relatively chaste embrace toward the end of the film. Yen wants to convert Megan to loving him, and to respecting his culture, for which she had expressed some contempt. He attempts to seduce her with kind words, poetry, cherry blossoms, costly jade, and his luxurious mansion, where he offers her servants, silks, jewels, cosmetics, perfume, and fine food. Yen says to Megan, ""You have the true missionary spirit. There are times when I would like to laugh at you, but there are also times when I find you admirable.""Megan resists. She is a captive. She wants to escape. She's afraid of being raped. She is horrified that even as Yen is attempting to seduce her, executions of his enemies continue apace in another portion of his compound, shootings Megan can hear. Megan, full of hate, says, ""You yellow swine.""She protests, ""It's pretty hard to become acquainted with a man who ruthlessly slaughters helpless prisoners in one move, and in the next shows such a tender reverence for the beauty of the moon. The subtlety of you Orientals is very much overestimated.""Megan attempts to teach General Yen Christian ways. She beseeches him to show kindness to his concubine, Mah-Li (Toshia Mori). He does so. After he gives Mah-Li a little leeway, Mah-Li uses that leeway to sabotage him. Mah-Li's actions tear the rug out from under Yen. His troops rebel; his wealth and power evaporate.Only after she has, inadvertently, destroyed Yen does Megan realize that she can no longer resist her attraction to him. She dresses in the silks Yen had given her, Asian costume she had previously spurned. She goes to his side and plumps his pillows as she had seen Mah-Li do. She embraces Yen.It's too late. Yen, ruined by his love for a Christian woman, has planned his suicide. Yen is about to consume the bitter tea that will kill him.""Silk. China gave the world silk,"" he says, enigmatically. Yen slumps on his throne, dead, even as Megan kneels at his feet and presses his lifeless hand to her lips.Later, Megan is seen escaping on a boat. Jones (Walter Connolly), an American businessman in China, tells her that she may encounter Yen in another life. ""Maybe he's the wind that's pushing that sail. Maybe he's the wind that's playing around in your hair.""What gets me is the filmmaker's craft that turned a flimsy, ridiculous miscegenation fantasy into a walk into someone else's dream, a dream that becomes your own.""The Bitter Tea of General Yen"" takes place in China, but it is the product of a Hollywood studio. No scenes were shot in China and a Swede and a Japanese play the two main Chinese characters, Yen and Mah-Li.Yet TBToGY evokes China with a sharp poignancy. It's a China brought to life through will and hocus pocus, Joseph Walker's exquisite cinematography, and magical suggestion. It's a sleeping child's dream of China. The film is a sparkler that goes off in your imagination. I feel that if Frank Capra directed, and Joseph Walker did the cinematography, they could use flashlights and bedsheets to turn my apartment into China.There's a relatively unimportant scene at the opening missionary party. One of the missionaries announces that he's been in China for fifty years. He tells a horrifying story of Mongolian bandits crucifying members of a caravan. Capra's filming of this throwaway scene exemplifies why I worship this movie. Capra uses his camera to make me, or you - the viewer - a celebrant at the party, and a listener to the story.He could have handled that scene the way a hundred other directors would have - just flatfootedly slapped the images up on the screen the way a baker slaps icing on a cake with a spatula. Just let the images provide the kind of boring exposition the story requiers to get going, but that viewers feel no need or desire to pay much attention to after they've assimilated the necessary background.But Capra uses his camera the way Rembrandt used a brush. He doesn't just create explanatory images that provide atmosphere and exposition. He lavishes as much of his art on a throwaway scene as on a heavy plot point. He finds the unique beauty and life in the common. He sucks you in. Every time I watch ""Bitter Tea,"" I pay as much attention to this scene as to more important ones, and I derive as much delight.In one scene, Megan is shown waking up from being drugged. She looks around and slowly realizes that she is in a train compartment with General Yen and his concubine. General Yen is seated across from her. Beyond a door with a window in it, troops carouse. The sound from the troops is muffled. Lighting is provided by visible lamps that cast realistic shadows.Megan is lying down, too sleepy to stand. She sees Yen, a man she had crossed paths with, seated across from her. She doesn't yet know what's going on, but she sees him staring at her intently. Megan watches as Mah-Li plumps Yen's pillows, puts out his cigarette, and puts his feet up. Megan's hand travels down her body, and she grabs a blanket and pulls it over herself.This scene is quiet - almost nothing is said - and yet it evokes much. It is one of the most erotic scenes I've ever seen in a film, and yet everyone is fully clothed and there is virtually no touching. Capra uses light, shadow, the muffled sound of the troops, the ""movement"" of the ""train"" to create sensations in the viewer.The scene in ""Bitter Tea of General Yen"" that anyone who talks about the movie talks about is the scene where Megan dreams of General Yen assaulting her.Megan is sleeping in the elaborate bedroom in which Yen has ensconced her. She dreams that her door is forced open. General Yen approaches. But he doesn't look as he looks in real life. His Chinese features are exaggerated. He moves in a creepy, cringing fashion. His fingernails are long and pointed. He fondles her.A new man breaks into her room. He is dressed as Dr. Strike, her American fiancee. Megan is happy. She will be rescued! The man in Strike's clothing punches Yen. The man then embraces Megan. He reveals himself to be ... not her fiancee, Strike, at all, but General Yen. Megan is ecstatic. She melts into bliss. The camera follows her face through her slack-jawed, smokey-eyed orgasm.But the scene that really throws me is when Megan attempts to convert Yen to Christianity. Megan's voice deepens and flutters. She is throwing all her passion into this attempt. It's obvious that her religiosity is sublimated sexuality. She wants Yen and she knows it's wrong - he's a sadist, cold, her sexual kidnapper, and Chinese. So rather than seduce him, or succumb to his seduction, she tries to convert him.Yen asks her why she should care about a Chinese person.She says that all humans are the same.He asks if she really believes that and he touches her hand.She recoils. The touch of a ""yellow swine"" is disgusting to her.He sees through her hypocrisy and denounces her for it.Yes, ""Bitter Tea"" is pure pulpy fantasy, but I've never seen a better depiction of desperate, caged human emotions.You can see why ""The Bitter Tea of General Yen"" upsets everybody. It was the first film shown at Radio City Music Hall. It was quickly withdrawn.Scientific Racism dominated thought and culture in the US at the time that ""Bitter Tea"" was released. American scientists, journalists, and indeed politicians and law declared not only Chinese people to be an inferior race apart, but also Italians like Capra (and Bohunks like me).It simply was not acceptable to depict a white girl even imagining intimate contact with a Chinese man, even if that Chinese man were played by Nils Asther, a Swede. The suggestion was so abhorrent that the Chinese man who provided imaginary satisfaction to Megan had to die at the end of the movie.Today, ""Bitter Tea"" offends the Politically Correct. The film certainly depicts ""Orientals"" as other - as different than whites. General Yen callously kills his enemies. He kidnaps a woman he wants, though he never touches her without her permission. He mistreats Mah-Li. Mah-Li is a conniver. The missionary tells the story of the Mongolian bandits crucifying merchants. The Politically Correct will not allow you to watch ""Bitter Tea"" without their warning labels attached.In addition to the heart, imagination, and craft onscreen, it is the quiet, harmless perversity and transgression of ""Bitter Tea"" that make me love it as much as I do.",5,"Beautiful, Magical, Perverse",1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,9311,"['Warning', 'comments', 'reveal', 'end', 'movie',

425082,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,6304481764,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[15, 15]","Frank Capra's groundbreaking story of an interracial romance between a Catholic missionary in wartorn China (played by a gorgeous young Barbara Stanwyck) and a cruel, haughty Chinese warlord, played -- in the style of the time -- by a white guy. It's a very unusual film, and much different than most other Capra classics. To begin with, the story takes place outside of the director's usual Middle-America tromping grounds, and his dramatizations of the bloodshed and chaos taking place in Asia are pretty amazing... Hard-hitting stuff for a still-isolationist nation to sit through, but material Capra would sucessfully revisit in his WWII propaganda films. The main story, though, is about two people struggling to bridge a deep racial divide -- although the film is rife with sterotypes, Capra clearly meant to project a progressive image onto his characters. It may be a little difficult for modern audiences to passively sit through some of the dialogue, but the film's still a fascinating snapshot of its times, worth considering on a variety of levels. The cinematography and set design are also both quite stunning.",5,A very different Frank Capra film...,1040342400,"12 20, 2002",2002,1124,"['Frank', 'Capra', 'groundbreaking', 'story', 'interracial', 'romance', 'Catholic', 'missionary', 'wartorn', 'China', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'cruel', 'haughty', 'Chinese', 'warlord', 'played', 'style', 'time', 'white', 'guy', 'very', 'unusual', 'film', 'much', 'different', 'most', 'other', 'Capra', 'classics', 'begin', 'story', 'place', 'director', 'usual', 'Middle-America', 'tromping', 'grounds', 'dramatizations', 'bloodshed', 'chaos', 'taking', 'place', 'Asia', 'are', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'Hard-hitting', 'stuff', 'still-isolationist', 'nation', 'sit', 'material', 'Capra', 'would', 'sucessfully', 'revisit', 'WWII', 'propaganda', 'films', 'main', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'struggling', 'bridge', 'deep', 'racial', 'divide', 'film', 'rife', 'sterotypes', 'Capra', 'clearly', 'meant', 'project', 'progressive', 'image', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'difficult', 'modern', 'audiences', 'passively', 'sit', 'dialogue', 'film', 'still', 'fascinating', 'snapshot', 'times', 'worth', 'considering', 'variety', 'levels', 'cinematography', 'set', 'design', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'stunning']",Bitter Tea of General Yen VHS
425083,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6304481764,Douglas M,"[13, 13]","This extraordinary film, way ahead of its time, provides unforgettable viewing.  The story is unlike anything that came out of Hollywood ever and this was 1933! Barbara Stanwyck plays a missionary's fiance who is captured by a Chinese warlord, played by Swedish Nils Asther. The film explores the clash of the cultures as the western and narrow minded Stanwyck learns to understand the oriental Asther.Directed by Frank Capra, in his legacy it is unique, so different to the sentimental comedies in which he later specialised. He was trying for an Oscar as best picture but the film was too off-beat to have wide appeal and it was not a box office success. It has a dream/nightmare quality and spectacular soft focus photography. Nils Asther is inscrutable and completely convincing in spite of his occidental profile and stature. Stanwyck displays her unusual naturalism and the juxtaposition of her realistic persona to his exotic one makes their relationship unforgettable. The last few minutes of the film are incredibly powerful. You will never forget the closing shot.This was the last of 4 films which Stanwyck made with Capra at Columbia in the early thirties.

425084,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6304481764,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 2]","""The Bitter Tea of General Yen"" was one of the most controversial films of the early 30s because of the romantic involvement of a  Missionary (Barbara Stanwyck) who is rescued by a Chinese war lord (Nils Asther).Variety said ""Seeing a Chinaman attempting to romance with a pretty and supposedly decent young American white woman is bound to evoke adverse reaction."" The New York Times called it ""scarcely plausible"". The film was banned in some parts of the British Empire and severely edited in other parts.Cinema at this time demanded that sex between whites and non-whites had to meet a bad end, often death. In ""Sons of the Gods"" (1930) the women are offended to be next to ""chinks"", and Constance Bennett whips Richard Barthelmess when she learns that he hid his Chinese background from her. In ""Madame Butterfly"" (1932) Asian Sylvia Sydney commits hari kari when Cary Grant marries a white woman. In ""Bordertown"" (1935), lust for a Mexican (Paul Muni) leads Bette Davis on a path to murder and insanity. Even as late as 1957 (""Sayonara""), Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki commit suicide because they cannot be together, and John Wayne seeks to kill his niece in ""The Searchers"" (1956) because she has been living with Indians.Sultry Barbara Stanwyck (1907-90) made more than 80 films and was nominated 4 times for an Oscar (""Stella Dallas"", ""Ball of Fire"", ""Double Indemnity"", ""Sorry Wrong Number""). She won 3 Emmys (""The Barbara Stanwyck Show"", ""Big Valley""). AFI lists her as # 11 among the ""Top 100 Greatest Screen Legends"". This is one of her best pre Oscar roles.Nils Asther (1897-1981) was a leading actor in Sweden and came to the US in 1927. This was his most famous role and he is excellent.FWIW - Another Swedish actor, Warner Oland, also played Asian characters, starting with ""The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu"" (1929) and continuing in the many Charlie Chan films. Until the 60s (and even later) non-whites were consistently played by whites in films like ""Birth of a Nation"", ""Last of the Mohicans"", ""Madame Butterfly"", ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"", ""Viva Villa"", ""Bordertown"", etc.Walter Connolly (1887-1940) plays an American adviser to the General. He appeared in some 50 films between 1914 and 1939, and is best known as Claudette Colbert's father from Oscar winner ""It Happened One Night"" and as the title role from ""The Great Victor Herbert"" (1939)FWIW - Connolly was so convincing as the scoundrelous businessman seeking to interfere in the internal politics of China that as late as the 1950s the State Department was still requesting edits.Richard Loo (1903-1983) has a small part as an aide to General Yen. Loo was Master Sun (the Weapons Master) in the TV series ""Kung Fu"". Between 1942 and 1981 Loo appeared in more than 100 films.Frank Capra (1897-1991) directs. He began in the silent era in 1915, ultimately made nearly 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar 7 times, winning 3 times (""It Happened One Night"", Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" and ""You Can't Take it With You""). He's best known for his small town comedies, but this was a style he developed after this film.This was the fourth of five films in which Capra directed Stanwyck. Capra said she was ""destined to be beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras. In a Hollywood popularity contest she would win first prize hands down.""The photography is courtesy of Joseph Walker (1892-1985), Capra's favorite cinematographer - they made 18 films together. Walker was nominated 4 times for an Oscar (""You can't Take it With You"", ""Only Angels Have Wings"", ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"", ""The Jolson Story"") although his legacy is best remembered for the invention of the zoom lense. His work on the mob scenes and the war are particularly noteworthy, as is the dream sequence, especially considering the date.The film was a box office bomb even though it premiered at the opening of Radio City Music Hall. The NY Times called it ""fairly entertaining"" and praised the ""conspicuously good portrayals by Nils Asther and Walter Connolly.""1932 was a good year for films - Grand Hotel"" was the Oscar and box office king, Jean Harlow had 2 films in the top 10 (""Red Headed Woman"" and ""Red Dust"") as did Miriam Hopkins (""Trouble in Paradise"" and ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"") and Wallace Beery (""Champ"" and ""Grand Hotel""). Other notable films that year were ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"", ""Freaks"" ,""A Farewell to Arms"", ""Scarface"", ""Horse Feathers"" and ""Tarzan The Ape Man"".Bottom line - an OK film from the early 30s that reveals the prejudices of the period while telling a doomed love story.",3,Early 30s love affair,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,4562,"['Bitter', 'Tea', 'General', 'Yen', 'was',

425085,A106016KSI0YQ,6304481764,Jay Dickson,"[30, 31]","This was the first film to open at Radio City Music Hall in 1933, and it was so far ahead of its time it was a popular failure. It will probably remind of you nothing like Frank Capra's later films, but it's probably his most lyrical and sensitive work--there's no question that it's a masterpiece. Set in China during the ""warlord period"" of the late 20s and early 30s, the film concerns the strange abduction of a New England missionary (played by Barbara Stanwyck) and a cruel but highly cultured Chinese general (played by a Nils Asther, of all people, a Scandinavian). As the general tries to woo the missionary, her conflicted feelings for him come to the forefront--while all the while the warlord's political fortunes begin to crumble.Stanwyck was never so subtle as she is here--she plays Megan as moral, tender, and conflicted, but not in the least bit prissy (she is that rarest of creatures, a genuinely virtuous woman). As Asther manages to breathe real depth into what could have otherwise been a racial caricature: although the film still wince-inducingly reminds us, at times, that it is a product of its period in some ways (as in its depiction of the treacherous Mah-Li), nonetheless it confronts head-on the racist stereotypes of white colonialists in China. The final scene between the two leads is absolutely stunning--you won't be prepared for where the film takes the characters, and yet in a strange way it all makes a wondrous kind of dream-like sense. Do yourself a favor and watch this film--it's really one-of-a-kind.",5,Stanwyck and Capra outdo themselves,1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,1545,"['was', 'first', 'film', 'open', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', '1933', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'was', 'popular', 'failure', 'will', 'probably', 'remind', 'nothing', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'later', 'films', 'probably', 'most', 'lyrical', 'sensitive', 'work', 'question', 'masterpiece', 'Set', 'China', 'warlord', 'period', 'late', '20s', 'early', '30s', 'film', 'strange', 'abduction', 'New', 'England', 'missionary', 'played', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'cruel', 'highly', 'cultured', 'Chinese', 'general', 'played', 'Nils', 'Asther', 'people', 'Scandinavian', 'general', 'tries', 'woo', 'missionary', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'come', 'forefront', 'warlord', 'political', 'fortunes', 'begin', 'crumble.Stanwyck', 'was', 'never', 'so', 'subtle', 'here', 'Megan', 'moral', 'tender', 'conflicted', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'prissy', 'rarest', 'creatures', 'genuinely', 'virtuous', 'woman', 'Asther', 'breathe', 'real', 'depth', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'racial', 'caricature', 'film', 'still', 'wince-inducingly', 'times', 'product', 'period', 'ways', 'depiction', 'treacherous', 'Mah-Li', 'nonetheless', 'head-on', 'racist', 'stereotypes', 'white', 'colonialists', 'China', 'final', 'scene', 'two', 'leads', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'prepared', 'where', 'film', 'characters', 'yet', 'strange', 'way', 'wondrous', 'kind', 'dream-like', 'sense', 'Do', 'favor', 'watch', 'film', 'really', 'one-of-a-kind']",Bitter Tea of General Yen VHS
425086,A6S7155T8VTHK,6304481764,J. F. McCausland,"[0, 1]","The pairing of Barbara Stanwyck and Frank Capra is one of the unsung duets of Hollywood's Golden Age, and this pre-code film is one of their best, if not one of their better known. Missionary Megan Davis arrives in China and is kidnapped by war lord, General Yen. She fights her attraction for him because, at that time, interracial romances were unacceptable, not to mention his occupation and reputation are severely lacking for a woman doing missionary work. This is a fairly frank and open depiction of an interracial romance, with the dream sequence openly portraying obvious sexual attraction and obsession. Because it is a pre-code film, Capra had a great deal more freedom in making this film than he would have had just a few years later; indeed, the film was not re-released (as was usual practice in Hollywood) due to objections to it's miscegenation. Personally, what truly appeals is the breathtaking, luminous beauty of this film. The sets! The lighting! The camera angles! The costumes! Sigh! The supporting cast excels, as well, especially beautiful Toshia Mori as the traitorous concubine, Mah-Li, and the always excellent Walter Connolly as Yen's financial advisor. The Chinese Yen is portrayed by Caucasian Asther in  yellow-face, the one disturbing element of the film. However, it is doubtful at that time that a Chinese actor would ever have been cast in the role because of the strong romantic element (as well as the overtly sexual chemistry). I suppose The Powers That Be were able to allow the story of an interracial romance to be told, but couldn't quite extend themselves to actually depicting the real thing. Still, the film features gorgeous cinematography, with a riveting action/romance story angle, as well as superior acting.

Barbara Stanwyck herself said in later years that the whole idea of the film was years ahead of its time upon release. This does go part of the way towards explaining why it was banned in England and Australia upon release and strongly criticised for its content. Time has luckily redeemed this wonderful production and today it is  much more respected for its own merits.I appreciate the film not only for the very very daring subject matter that it tackled for the time but also for the absolutely beautiful sets and costumnes . Indeed the whole production has a rich, other worldly quality to it that makes the film a memorable viewing experience.The cast of this production is top notch. Barbara Stanwyck, always one of my favorite actresses has one of her very early memorable roles as the young missionary abducted by the mysterious and sensual General Yen, played by silent star Nils Asher. He is particularly effective in his role turning Yen from being just a one dimensional villian into someone who you almost start to feel for. Asher didn't seem to do too much work in the sound era but he is very effective in this characterisation.Like the other reviewers I was stunned by the very original dream sequence which first reveals Stanwyck's secret passion for General Yen. Considered shocking in it's time today it simply strikes me as being very originally done and very different to anything that would appear in a film of that time.&quot;The Bitter Tea of General Yen&quot; is a lyrical, hauntingly beautiful production that continues to intrigue me. I strongly recommend it as a great piece of early 30's film making done on a very adult and sensitive level",5,"A mysterious, hauntingly beautiful film  ahead of its time",1019433600,"04 22, 2002",2002,1773,"['film', 'will', 'always', 'mystify', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'real', 'period', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'said', 'later', 'years', 'whole', 'idea', 'film', 'was', 'years', 'ahead', 'time', 'release', 'go', 'part', 'way', 'explaining', 'why', 'was', 'banned', 'England', 'Australia', 'release', 'strongly', 'criticised', 'content', 'Time', 'luckily', 'redeemed', 'wonderful', 'production', 'today', 'much', 'more', 'respected', 'own', 'merits.I', 'appreciate', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'very', 'daring', 'subject', 'matter', 'tackled', 'time', 'also', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'costumnes', 'Indeed', 'whole', 'production', 'rich', 'other', 'worldly', 'quality', 'film', 'memorable', 'viewing', 'experience.The', 'cast', 'production', 'top', 'notch', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'always', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'one', 'very', 'early', 'memorable', 'roles', 'young', 'missionary', 'abducted', 'mysterious', 'sensual', 'General', 'Yen', 'played', 'silent', 'star', 'Nils', 'Asher', 'particularly', 'effective', 'role', 'turning', 'being', 'just', 'one', 'dimensional', 'villian', 'someone', 'who', 'almost', 'start', 'feel', 'Asher', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'sound', 'era', 'very', 'effective', 'characterisation.Like', 'other', 'reviewers', 'was', 'stunned', 'very', 'original', 'dream', 'sequence', 'first', 'Stanwyck', 'secret', 'passion', 'General', 'Yen', 'Considered', 'shocking', 'time', 'today', 'simply', 'being', 'very', 'originally', 'done', 'very', 'different', 'anything', 'would', 'appear', 'film', 'time.', 'quot', 'Bitter', 'Tea', 'General', 'Yen', 'quot', 'lyrical', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'production', 'intrigue', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'great', 'piece', 'early', '30', 'film', 'making', 'done', 'very', 'adult', 'sensitive', 'level']",Bitter Tea of General Yen VHS
