1046458,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B000MGTQ6G,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[4, 5]","Finally, we get another jewel from Norman Lear's crown with this first season of MAUDE on dvd, and it does not disappoint!The controversial first season dealt with infidelity, drug use, divorce, race relations, and abortion. And even though this series is about 35 years old, the subjects are as appropriate today as they were back then. And more importantly, the show is still funny!The comedic timing of Beatrice Arthur, the clever writing, and the chemistry between Arthur and co-star Bill Macy (who plays Maude's fourth husband Walter Findley) is the backbone that keeps MAUDE entertaining even after so many years. There are explosive fights in every episode that are hilarious, and yet in the end, these two characters really seem to care and need each other.For those of you who aren't familiar with the Maude Findley character  just picture Bea Arthur's ""Dorthy Zbornack"" character from the GOLDEN GIRLS, only turn up the heat to full blast! What you get is a combination of ""Archie Bunker(ALL IN THE FAMILY)"" and ""George Jefferson(THE JEFFERSONS)"" all rolled into one irascible, neurotic, loud-mouthed, liberal feminist, who's hilariously funny, named Maude!This dvd set contains all 22 episodes from season one and look bright, sharp and colorful. Although I did notice some tiny white specks that seem to have been on certain camera angles, which means that could've been dust or something on the camera lens, but it wasn't too distracting.There are no special features included with this set, so hopefully they'll be available on future releases, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Sony doesn't exactly spoil us with special features; just look at the dvd releases of ALL IN THE FAMILY and THE JEFFERSONS.But aside from that, this dvd set is still a treasure and the show stands up on its own.",5,CHAOS!!!,1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,1801,"['Finally', 'get', 'jewel', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'crown', 'first', 'season', 'MAUDE', 'dvd', 'not', 'disappoint', 'controversial', 'first', 'season', 'dealt', 'infidelity', 'drug', 'use', 'divorce', 'race', 'relations', 'abortion', 'even', 'series', '35', 'years', 'old', 'subjects', 'are', 'appropriate', 'today', 'were', 'back', 'then', 'more', 'importantly', 'show', 'still', 'funny', 'comedic', 'timing', 'Beatrice', 'Arthur', 'clever', 'writing', 'chemistry', 'Arthur', 'co-star', 'Bill', 'Macy', 'who', 'Maude', 'fourth', 'husband', 'Walter', 'Findley', 'backbone', 'MAUDE', 'entertaining', 'even', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'are', 'explosive', 'fights', 'episode', 'are', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'end', 'two', 'characters', 'really', 'seem', 'care', 'need', 'other.For', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Maude', 'Findley', 'character', 'just', 'picture', 'Bea', 'Arthur', 'Dorthy', 'Zbornack', 'character', 'GOLDEN', 'GIRLS', 'only', 'turn', 'up', 'heat', 'full', 'blast', 'What', 'get', 'combination', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'ALL', 'IN', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'George', 'Jefferson', 'THE', 'JEFFERSONS', 'rolled', 'one', 'irascible', 'neurotic', 'loud-mouthed', 'liberal', 'feminist', 'who', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'named', 'Maude', 'dvd', 'set', '22', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'look', 'bright', 'sharp', 'colorful', 'did', 'notice', 'tiny', 'white', 'specks', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'certain', 'camera', 'angles', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dust', 'something', 'camera', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'distracting.There', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'set', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'available', 'future', 'releases', 'would', ""n't"", 'hold', 'breath', 'Sony', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'spoil', 'special', 'features', 'just', 'look', 'dvd', 'releases', 'ALL', 'IN', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'THE', 'JEFFERSONS.But', 'aside', 'dvd', 'set', 'still', 'treasure', 'show', 'up', 'own']",Maude: Season 1

1046466,A3E3VGOWHL4OPR,B000MGTQ6G,Chris L,"[2, 2]","Maude was one of those shows that changed how women were perceived in the home. Not only that but how they were able to think and do for themselves. This show changed everything in the beginning because they went full-on in to controversial issues. The abortion episode was huge because nothing like that had been on TV before. Today, shows get away with a lot worse than before. Maude stood up for the lower person only to make a fool of herself sometimes. She would stand up for a cause or person only for them to tell her that they can do it on their own. Sometimes she was the Archie Bunker of the household, always feeling like she was saying the right thing only for it to blow up in her face later on. But despite that she knew when to push for a cause that was worth fighting for.It was sad to know that this was the only season of Maude that was put on DVD. This show did a lot for women's rights and ushered in a new era of thinking for women. The show also touched on issues like drinking, and race. Many networks were afraid to talk about this but because it was a Norman Lear show, they allowed him to discuss it.If you have never seen this show, watch it and learn what it took to get America talking about issues that were important then. The character of Maude came from All in the Family, a cousin of Edith Bunker, and after just two appearances on the show, Maude got her own show, which also led to another spin-off, Good Times, which came from her maid.The condition of the case was perfect and the delivery was very fast.

It is a wonderful show, and though much of the supporting cast is adequate to good, there is no question that the whole thing hangs on Bea Arthur's performance.  (The following is a spoiler--if you don't want specific details, skip to the next paragraph).  I knew I was hooked during the fourth episode, when Maude's daughter is dating Maude's former flame.  All vinegar about it initially, Maude softens when she hears that the ex called her daughter ""Maude"" when they were together.  Maude assumes it was during lovemaking, and as Maude discovers this, the camera freezes on the back of her head for about 5 seconds--an eternity in sitcom time.  After a pause like that, you have to deliver a knockout, and when Bea Arthur turns to face the camera, utterly transformed by the memory of a past love into a pile of mush, you will be absolutely convinced that she is one of the best actresses ever to grace an American television program.What impresses me about the show, is that there is a lot of plot packed into these shows--it is depressing to me how current sitcoms have devolved into 20 second scenes of setup/punchline then switch to another scene.  This show deals intellegently with topical issues, never stretching for the laughs--but they come, and when they do, they are genuine and organic.  I have trouble believing that this show was lodged in the Top 5 of the Nielsens for much of its run--I just don't think it could happen today.

Enter Archie Bunker... the original reactionary conservative, his hippie son-in-law Mike... Edith, Glory... and the belches, flushing toilets and cutting edge humor and story lines from which many of the other great sitcoms of the 70's would spin off (including Good Times and The Jeffersons) - - alas along came MAUDE - - Archie's arch rival liberal in-law from hell...  and its unforgettable theme song (sung by Donny Hathaway!)Like ALL IN THE FAMILY, Maude featured the cutting edge social satire, but in many ways went a step further...Each episode wasn't only a classic TV sitcom, but (like all in the family) a 30 minute teleplay  taking on a theme or social issue bound to rile up the viewers.  (All In The Family itself managed to offend everyone... from Conservatives who didn't feel so comfortable about its irreverential humor, to liberals who took Archie's bigoted rants a bit too seriously.)  - - Maude, in contrast was both outspoken feminist and liberal - - but just as progressive and englightened as mis-informed, nervous and neurotic (so much for liberal media bias!) - Her foils:  The rest of the world:  including her nice ever-suffering Maytag salesman husband - - as well as fiesty live at home divorced daughter w/ child and a reactionary conservative Doctor neighbor Aruthur, played by Conrad Bain, Dad from DIFFERENT STROKES.  - - Regardless of whether you're politically left or to the right, each episode will definitely give you stuff to wag your finger about - - though if you're simply normal and level headed, you'll be too busy laughing at ignorance across the social and political spectrum, and sigh thinking how contemporary the show still feels today.  (Haven't we progressed at all since then?  Why *doesn't* the show feel dated???)Repeatedly rewatchable, this is TV that makes you laugh as well as think... and full of lines you may even find yourself repeating on occasion...

1046474,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,B000MGTQ6G,Edward Aycock,"[7, 8]","The adventures of Edith Bunker's cousin Maude, played by Beatrice Arthur, is finally on DVD.  First off, despite the overlap with the actresses, be warned that this is NOT another ""Golden Girls.""""Maude"" is the show that launched ""Good Times"", with Esther Rolle playing Florida Evans who somehow isn't the same Florida Evans she played on the other show, as well as pairing Arthur and Rue McClanahan for the first time.  McClanahan is only a guest star on a couple of episodes the first season but becomes full time in the second season.  Try not to freak out when McClanahan appears in a grey wig (!) and in 1972 manages to look older than she would as Blanche Devereaux thirteen years later.Often a sitcom that's heavy on social commentary and contemporary references doesn't age well, but that's not the case with ""Maude""'s first season.  The writing is sharp and reflects a country in crisis, much like the way things are today.Yes, this is one of the only US television programs in history where the lead character has an abortion. The story, the two-part ""Maude's Dilemma,"" is an extremely well-written story about a woman in her late forties who finds herself pregnant.  In addition to the good writing (interestingly, ""Maude's Dilemma"" was written by none other than Susan Harris, who later created Arthur's 80's vehicle, ""The Golden Girls""), it's extremely well acted as Maude ponders what to do and needs to make a very personal decision.  No network TV show today would even try and touch the issue which is unfortunate: ""Maude's Dilemma"" goes beyond the talking points and makes a controversial issue personal for one of the first and only times. I'd recommend that nearly everybody should watch these episodes and see the human side of the issue.Another notable episode is one in which maude and the other neighborhood housewives protest the arrest of a local teen for marijuana possession.  So what do they do? They decide to buy pot and try and get themselves arrested.""Maude"" is a gutsy and fearless show that manages to be both dated and surprisingly current.

1046484,A2BLITJITO97N5,B000MGTQ6G,Ingalls,"[3, 32]","Wow! Some shows do not age well.When this was filmed before a live audience using videotape, it was considered a cutting edge approach to sit-coms. Unfortunately, video from 1972 looks primitive today. I can imagine how it will look in HD when everything goes digital.1) Everyone looks awful. Rue Mclanahan actually appears older here than she did on Golden Girls. Real life boozehound Bea Arthur looks bloated and has such badly applied make-up that you wonder if she slept in it. Bill Macy, the guy who play's Maude's husband, and Maude's daughter Adrienne Barbeau both look ugly.2) The comedy is stridently leftist and shrill. The daughter plays the feminist as a pompous, self-righteous, preachy, angry, self-centered, in-your-face witch. That might work in New York - which is still full of these type of women - but she would be glacially frozen out in the rest of the country. No wonder the character is a divorced single mom; what man could stand to put up with her?3) This is forty years old and it shows. In the episode, ""Maude's dilemna,"" Maude is pregnant and drinking - get this - double martinis. Bill Macy chokes on a piece of chicken and the doctor, instead of doing the Heimlich Maneuver (which no one knew about yet - the first article about it appeared in a medical journal in 1974 - two years after Maude debuted), shoves bread down his throat in order to force a stuck chicken bone down his throat! This is scary stuff.4) Bea Arthur. This is the real shocker. Anyone who remembers Arthur as a great comedienne will be surprised to see that her character is nothing but a set of a dozen different shticks that she repeats endlessly. The deadpan stare, the explosive outrage with shouting, the hurled epithet - it's a small bag of tricks - and an irritating one after the initial surprise of seeing such an unpleasant woman on TV wears off. Why would Bill Macy's character (or any man for that matter) marry this butch harridan? And Maude was married four times? Where did she find so many masochistic men? In an S and M club? If a woman married a man like Maude, we would tell her that she must have terribly low self-esteem that she would put up with such a troll. I guess if a man marries a horrible woman like Maude, it's supposed to mean that the man is a feminist?

1046487,AQ01Q3070LT29,B000MGTQ6G,James McDonald,"[4, 4]","We have waited a long time for this Norman Lear sitcom to appear on DVD.The character of ""Maude Finlay"" came from 2 episodes of ""All in the Family"" (1971-79) during the second season. Beatrice Arthur first appeared in the episode ""Cousin Maude's Visit"" (December 11, 1971).If you thought ""Archie Bunker"" was very vociferative on politics, union labor, black and polish people and God, then wait until you hear Edith's cousin, Maude.Maude and Archie could go around and around on a topic, including women's liberation. Maude would win.We saw ""Maude Finley again when Edith & Archie Bunker went to New York to visit Maude for Carol's wedding (March 11, 1972). These two episodes are not on the ""Maude"" DVD, but can be seen on theAll in the Family - The Complete Second SeasonDVD.Beatrice Arthur was so popular with the tv viewers, she was spun-off into her own CBS tv series, Maude (1972-78).The cast included Bill Macy as Maude's husband, ""Walter"", Adrienne Barbeau as daughter ""Carol"", Brian Morrison [Airport 1975/Airport '77and The Concorde: Airport '79 in additional footage] as Carol's young son, ""Phillip"", Conrad Bain as the neighbor and Walter's best friend, ""Arthur"", Rue McClanahan as ""Vivian"", Esther Rolle as ""Florida Evans""--Maude's new housekeeper.Bill Macy also appeared in 2 ""All in the Family"" episodes, ""Archie sees a Mugging"" (January 29, 1972) as a ""uniformed policeman"". Six weeks later, he returned in an episode as ""Walter Finley"".Maude had a beautiful home with her fourth husband, Walter. She convinced her adult daughter, Carol and her young son to live with them in the two-story house. Maude was an activist on politics and women's rights. Don't cross Maude on an issue because she is a woman who is liberal, headstrong and speaks her mind. When she was right, she knew it. When she was wrong, she would relent and say so. She was emotional too. Always worried about her daughter Carol and having the perfect marriage. Maude loved Walter.Some familar faces in this season:Ed Begley Jr, Helen Page Camp, William Redfield, Cesare Danova, Pasty Garrett, Paul Barswlou, Jon Korkes, Vincent Gardenia, Louis Guss, Frank Aletter, Van Johnson, Barbara Rush, Elizabeth Fraser, Frank Campanella, Tom Bosley, Rosemary Murphy.Funny Line: ""God's gonna get you for that, Walter"".Notes: Esther Rolle would later leave the show, but continued her ""Florida"" character inGood Times - The Complete First Season(1974-79).  John Amos continued his character as her husband.In the 3 episodes John Amos appeared in on ""Maude"". His character name was ""Henry Evans"". In the spin-off ""Good Times"", the character name changed to ""James Evans Sr."".They were going to revamp the ""Maude"" tv series. After 4 episodes, Bea Arthur decided she no longer wanted to play ""Maude"". The new tv series was remade as ""Hangin' In"" (August 1979) ended up with only Bill Macy.Beatrice Arthur and Rue McClanahan would reteam forThe Golden Girls - The Complete First Season(1985-92).Update: Bea Arthur passed away peacefully April 25, 2009 in the early morning from cancer.

Norman Lear saw the possibility of spinning off the character, and as the season finale of ""All"", he broadcast a pilot for ""Maude"" which included Archie and Edith.  The pilot set up everything for the sitcom to come: Strong liberal woman, married 4 times, her divorced daughter and grandson living with her and her husband Walter.  In the Fall of 1972, ""Maude"" debuted and was an instant hit, hitting number 4 for the year, impressive for a new show. The program stayed in the top 10 for four years, and lasted a total of six.The key to ""Maude's"" success was clearly Bea Arthur, who carried the show. The first season intoduced Esther Rolle as Florida, Maude's maid, who's character would eventually spin-off with ""Good Times"". Vivian, Maude's best friend, was unmarried during season one, and would eventually marry Arthur, Walter's best friend.  Arthur was an ultra conservative, and a perfect foil for Maude.  As the seasons wore on he became more and more buffonish.The writing was sharp, and you can clearly see the influence of Norman Lear. In 1973 Maude faces the decision of giving birth at age 47 or having an abortion, which had just become legal.  As with all Lear shows, Maude was always very topical, without becoming preachy. Bea Arthur has great timing, and as well as being funny is actually a solid actress.Hopefully Maude will gain new fans.  For some reason it was nowhere near as popular as ""All in the Family"" in syndication, so it is not as well known.

The first time we see Maude is in a great ""All in the Family"" episode where she comes over to the Bunker household to help Edith out when Archie, Gloria, and Mike all get sick at the same time and it becomes too much for Edith to handle on her own. And almost immediately Archie and Maude go at each others' throats. Another time we see Maude is when Archie and Edith go to Maude's house to attend the wedding of Maude's daughter. And it was after that is when ""All in the Family"" creator Norman Lear presented the first ""All in the Family"" spinoff show, ""Maude"". And to this day, it's still the best of all those spinoffs.""Maude"" was a perfect showcase for Bea Arthur, who at the time this show premiered wasn't all that well known to TV audiences (Arthur was better known for her work on stage; she won a Tony Award in 1966 for her role as Vera Charles in the hit Broadway musical ""Mame"", which she reprised in the 1974 feature film). But ""Maude"" made her an instant TV star, and deservedly so. ""Maude"" was quite similar to ""All in the Family"" as it followed pretty much the same formula: topical issues, a sharp tongue, and lots of confrontational comedy. And now the first season of ""Maude"" is now available on DVD. I had watched this show in reruns back in the mid-80s after ""The Golden Girls"" made its prime-time debut. So I can't tell you how thrilled I was to see all 22 episodes of the first season of ""Maude"" uncut. I had never seen episodes of ""Maude"" uncut, and I was extremely happy to see scenes that I had never seen before. (I was only a year old when ""Maude"" debuted on CBS in 1972.)Instead of focusing on the Bunkers, ""Maude"" focused primarily on her own family. Besides Maude, there was her fourth husband Walter (Bill Macy), who worked as an appliance salesman; her divorced daughter Carol (Adrienne Barbeau), whom she had from a previous marriage; her next door neighbor Arthur (Conrad Bain), who also happened to be Walter's best friend and worked as a doctor; and her maid Florida (Esther Rolle), who was the first of three maids to work for Maude during the show's six year run. Also living under the Findlay roof was Carol's son (and Maude's grandson) Philip (Brian Morrison), who didn't have much of an impact in season one, but would eventually get more screen time in later seasons. Some of the issues that were tackled on ""Maude"" were quite groundbreaking back in its day. For the first season, these issues ranged from Maude trying to get arrested for protesting after a local youth might serve jail time for drug possession to a debate about sexual freedom after Philip is caught playing doctor with Arthur's granddaughter. But probably the most controversial episode of season one (controversial in the `70s; might not be as controversial today) had to be the two-part episode titled ""Maude's Dilemma"", when Maude discovers that she's pregnant and tries to figure out what to do. It should be pointed out that this two part episode was written by Susan Harris, who would later go on to create the hit TV shows ""Soap"" and (you guessed it) ""The Golden Girls"". ""Maude"" also became famous for her classic catchphrase that was usually directed at her husband: ""God'll get you for that, Walter!""The first season of ""Maude"" is as funny as it gets. There are lots of big laughs throughout season one, and there isn't a dull moment in any of the 22 episodes. Bea Arthur is a comic genius in her first starring role on television, for which she received an Emmy nomination as Best Actress in a Comedy Series (the show also received a nomination as Best Comedy Series for the first season). She's absolutely perfect as Maude. Even though she's the star of the show, she gets great support from co-stars Macy, Barbeau, Bain, and Rolle. First season guest stars include Arthur's future ""Golden Girls"" co-star Rue McClanahan as Maude's best friend Vivian (who would become a regular on ""Maude"" later on); John Amos as Florida's husband (Rolle and Amos would later depart for their own series, the ""Maude"" spinoff ""Good Times""); Tom Bosley (a few years before ""Happy Days"") as a doctor who treats Maude after she breaks out with a rash; and the late Vincent Gardenia (""Moonstruck""), who's absolutely hilarious as a judge who has to deal with Maude when she comes to court to prove her innocence after receiving a speeding ticket for going only four miles over the limit. It should be pointed out that Gardenia and McClanahan ended up guest starring together as a middle age swinging couple on a classic episode of ""All in the Family"" shortly after their first guest appearances on ""Maude"", and Gardenia would turn up again on ""All in the Family"" a few years later in a new role as the Bunkers' next-door neighbor Frank Lorenzo.""Maude"" is a great show. If you loved Bea Arthur on ""The Golden Girls"", then you will love her on ""Maude"".",5,Maude - Season One,1176595200,"04 15, 2007",2007,5251,"['then', 'Maude', 'landing', 'role', 'Dorothy', 'hit',

Powell,"[2, 2]","Maude is GREAT!I've written a couple reviews on other 70's TV shows, and am a long time fan of All in the Family, but Maude simply completes the puzzle and is a perfect time capsule of what was going on during that era.These episodes are thought provoking and a great way for anyone that didn't grow up in this era, to get a glimpse into some of the struggles of the times.Maude was already middle aged, at the start of the sexual revolution, but she portrays a sexy, self confident woman, who is reluctant to reveal her own insecurities, but  they get coaxed out of her, regardless.  Maude often shows her tender side, albeit sometime while coupling it with a punch line to the stomach.Recently when at home sick, I flipped on a few of these episodes, and I had such a laugh, I had to watch them again with my wife when she arrived home from work.  Women in particular will get a kick out of Maude.  She makes no apologies for her behavior, and freely admits, having to burn through 3 husbands to get to her ""keeper"".Maude runs ""roughshod"" over people, and I always got the feeling that this was from years of taking crap from men.Another reviewer had mentioned their preference for Maude over All in the Family and Archie Bunker, but I think the 2 shows complement one another so much, it is genius.  I know Maude was a spin off of All in the Family, and remember seeing he appear on those early episodes, and Archie visiting Maude at some point in one of her Episodes. (I think....definitely not this series)I miss the no nonsense, get it done now, attitude of families from that era.

This was pretty much how I heard about Maude, considering I was born years after the show ended, I had no way of knowing about it until Amazon recommended it to me once I bought The Golden Girls on DVD. So I took a chance on ""Maude"", expecting the same biting wit and scathing one-liners that makes ""The Golden Girls"" such a TV Classic (and in many ways, it was way ahead of its' time).What a pity then, that ""Maude"" seems oddly dated, badly acted, and extremely, extremely stilted. Its very much a 'TV Show' in the most plastic sense of the word, with bizarre closeups and unflattering camera angles, but worst of all is the script. The main reason I got this was because I expected the same writing brilliance that they had on ""The Golden Girls"" (part of the same writing team worked on ""Maude"" as well), but I was left feeling awfully empty-handed.The primary problem here is that even though there are some great one liners and comedic situations (mostly revolving around the African-American maid), overall this runs more like a straight-forward soap-opera style show with some very weak jokes. Bea Arthur, who people say was excellent in this role, surprised me. I couldn't find any real 'acting' here - she seemed very loud, overbearing, and 'screamed' her dialogue more than 'delivering' it. Almost every line is yelled and torn to shreds, and I found this extremely headache inducing, after a point.The problem is, I wanted so much to like ""Maude"", only because ""The Golden Girls"" is probably my all-time favorite show. Sadly, at the end of it, it seemed extremely 'old' for me, and not at all timeless like how GG is, to this day. Even the situations here (womens' lib, abortion, etc) seem almost quaint and nostalgic in this day and age. ""Maude"" seems stuck in its' time, and Bea Arthur's loud performance just didn't work for me.Also, when I buy a DVD, repeat viewing is something that is of prime importance. How many DVDs do you own that you couldn't ever watch again? ""Maude"", unfortunately, is NOT one of those shows you could revisit on DVD. I consider this a strictly one-time viewing experience, and I felt it altogether unnecessary. If at all you are interested in this show due to Bea's later work, I urge you to sample some clips of it first before actually buying it, because huge chances are that you will not really like it. I know I didn't.Three Stars for Bea's wonderful presence. Though the show itself probably deserves just about two stars.

1046505,A1X1UZWUIDHCJ5,B000MGTQ6G,Marc Harshbarger,"[6, 6]","I loved ""Maude"" as a kid--and I love her more now.  I've always thought this show was better than ""All in the Family"".  Maybe because--as I've grown older--I agree far more with Maude's views on life--political and otherwise--than with Archie Bunker's.  Maude isn't perfect--the woman not the show--but you're rooting for her and can understand why she acts the way she does.  And the supporting characters are so much fun--husband Walter, daughter Carol (the wonderful Adrienne Barbeau), neighbor Arthur, and housekeeper Florida (Esther Rolle is perfect in this role).  Unfortunately, my favorite character, Maude's best friend, Vivian (played by Rue McClanahan), only shows up in two episodes during the first season.  But I'm so glad she was made a regular in the second season (which needs to come out on DVD ASAP).  Not all of the episodes of the first season are great--the two-hander Maude/Walter ones just don't strike the same tone as the rest of the shows (you need Carol and Arthur and Florida to put their two cents worth in in order for the series to really shine).  But most of the episodes are a delight: ""Maude & the Radical"" is a very funny Florida episode; ""Maude's Dilemma""--a 2-parter about Maude's unexpected pregnancy--was way ahead of its time and groundbreaking television; ""Walter's 50th Birthday"" is a very dark but hysterical episode; ""Maude and the Medical Profession"" is a hoot; ""Walter's Secret"" is a standout episode for Bill Macy; and ""The Perfect Marriage"" is my personal favorite--a Vivian episode, of course.  But ""Maude"" wouldn't be nearly as great without its star--Bea Arthur--who is sublime in the role.  Just watching her roar like a lion or deliver a sarcastic quip or give someone a withering look is amazing.  And despite the character's flaws, you just gotta love her.  So I urge everyone buy this first season of the show so Sony will release the second season.

1046506,A136LIEKVN88KW,B000MGTQ6G,"Martin S. Hennessee ""SeeingI""","[3, 3]","I've been waiting for this little-seen but well-remembered show to come to DVD.  I don't think it was ever syndicated, except to TVLand for a brief period in the 1990s.  What were my parents thinking letting me watch this as a kid?  I didn't get the jokes and references, but I was enthralled by Bea Arthur's barnstorming performance as the maniacal Maude.Having now seen the first season, I can say that the show's hit success was entirely deserved.  This is an excellent series from Normal Lear, with tight scripts, great acting, and hot-button issues (from black power to abortion to the drug war to women's rights to Nixon to alcoholism) handled with great humor and bravery.  Each teleplay is not so much a sitcom but a short play, the same way that All in the Family was.  Plus, the theme song, sung by Donny Hathaway, is a camp classic.Maude is the anti-Archie Bunker.  She's an opinionated, arrogant, bigoted jerk - but a LIBERAL one, whose prejudices are all the more infuriating because she is convinced of  her own benevolence and enlightened state of mind.  Thus Maude gets herself into one awkward situation after another, as her ""right on"" pretentions blow up in her face.  Maude made Bea Arthur a household name, which she would capitalize on later with ""The Golden Girls"" (created by Maude scriptwriter Susan Harris).  Arthur makes Maude immediately loveable, and nobody has matched her mastery of the withering glare or the deadpan ""take.""Bill Macy is great as Walter, Maude's 4th husband.  (""Life is trial and error,"" she shrugs.)  Rue McClanahan is her best friend Vivian, while housekeeper Florida Evans (Esther Rolle, a treasure) eventually moves off to Chicago to star in ""Good Times.""  Conrad Bain, best known as the kindly Mr. Drummond on ""Diff'rent Strokes,"" here plays Maude's conservative neighbor.  Adrianne Barbeau, whose fought ghosts in ""The Fog"" and enthralled ""Swamp Thing"" with her cleavage, is appealingly wry as Maude's daughter Carol.There are 5 more seasons of Maude and they can't come to DVD fast enough.  But come on, Sony, not a SINGLE special feature for $30?  No trailers, no interviews, no commentaries?  Not a photo gallery or measly cast & crew bio page?

1046507,A19JLMP0T6FNF5,B000MGTQ6G,M.C,"[5, 10]","""Maude"" was a bit of a let down for me. Like so many Norman Lear shows, it's loud and has ""issue of the week"" plots in each episode.  That would be okay if the writing were top notch, but it simply isn't. It's still better than many, many sitcoms out there today, but I would not call it a classic or even a great show.Bea Arthur does a great job with the material, but, at least in the first season, she has no nuance whatsoever; her role as Dorothy on ""Golden Girls"" is, in my opinion, much more nuanced and showcases better acting.  The other actors in the first season are a bit forgettable.Here's the problem: Even though ""Maude"" is more realistic than, say, ""Leave it to Beaver,"" it doesn't get the small details that are so important right. Maude's grandson, Phillip, is never around, the house is always clean, and Maude seems to have a LOT of time on her hands. There are no problems with money or normal, everyday issues.  The ""issues"" that are covered seem forced. It's clear the writers were trying desperately to be ""cutting edge,"" and I had to cringe a few times at the lack of subtlty. Shows that manage to be realistic, topical, AND subtle (""Roseanne,"" ""The Wonder Years"" for example) are, in my view, much more impressive.And, btw, to those of you who say ""Golden Girls"" is ""lightweight,"" I beg to differ. The show covered many important issues, but it did it through hilarious comedy and was more nuanced. I hate to say it, but I think there's a reason why the first season didn't sell too well.Maude Finley says ""there's a thin line between love and hate.""  Well, there's also a think line between being relevant, and trying way too hard.",3,"Tries a bit too hard, but give it a shot",1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,1657,"['Maude', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'so', 'many', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'loud', 'issue', 'week', 'plots', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'writing', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'simply', ""n't"", 'still', 'better', 'many', 'many', 'sitcoms', 'there', 'today', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'classic', 'even', 'great', 'show.Bea', 'Arthur', 'great', 'job', 'material', 'least', 'first', 'season', 'nuance', 'whatsoever', 'role', 'Dorothy', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'opinion', 'much', 'more', 'nuanced', 'better', 'acting', 'other', 'actors', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'bit', 'problem', 'Even', 'Maude', 'more', 'realistic', 'say', 'Leave', 'Beaver', ""n't"", 'get', 'small', 'details', 'are', 'so', 'important', 'right', 'Maude', 'grandson', 'Phillip', 'never', 'around', 'house', 'always', 'clean', 'Maude', 'have', 'LOT', 'time', 'hands', 'are', 'problems', 'money', 'normal', 'everyday', 'issues', 'issues', 'are', 'covered', 'seem', 'forced', 'clear', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'desperately', 'be', 'cutting', 'edge', 'had', 'cringe', 'few', 'times', 'lack', 'subtlty', 'manage', 'be', 'realistic', 'topical', 'AND', 'subtle', 'Roseanne', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'example', 'are', 'view', 'much', 'more', 'impressive.And', 'btw', 'who', 'say', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'lightweight', 'beg', 'differ', 'show', 'covered', 'many', 'important', 'issues', 'did', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'was', 'more', 'nuanced', 'hate', 'say', 'think', 'reason', 'why', 'first', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'too', 'well.Maude', 'Finley', 'thin', 'line', 'love', 'hate', 'Well', 'also', 'think', 'line', 'being', 'relevant', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard']",Maude: Season 1

1046511,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B000MGTQ6G,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[6, 6]","I bought this season because I'd never seen Maude before but had heard about it and knew the character from ""All in the Family"" and, of course, actress Beatrice Arthur from ""The Golden Girls"" (one of the funniest actresses of all time).  I thought it would be a politically controversial series from the liberal Maude's point of view rather than the conservative side of Archie Bunker.Politics certainly plays a large role in this first season but the series doesn't seem to push the envelope like ""All in the Family.""  Archie had an outspoken nemesis in Michael and many others who disagreed with him but Maude's conservative counterpart, neighbor Arthur played by Conrad Bain who later played the father on ""Diff'rent Strokes,"" seems a bit wishywashy to spark much heated debate.  Plus, he remains a close friend of Maude's husband Walter so there's more lighthearted argument rather than shouting matches.  The other characters have the same political/social leanings as Maude, so she doesn't get challenged much.  ""Maude Meets Florida"" is the big exception where Maude goes overboard in her liberalism and her proud, confident housekeeper puts her in her place.  I consider that episode the best of this season.  The main arguments are between Maude and Walter over sometimes silly issues.  They have a very loving relationship but they sure break a lot of things when they are mad.Other familiar faces are Esther Rolle and John Amos (playing their ""Good Times"" roles), Rue McClanahan (""Mama's Family,"" ""Golden Girls""), and Tom Bosley (""Happy Days""). It is very `70s and I like seeing the interior decorating of that time.  It was neat to watch the first time but I don't know if it's a show I'd want to watch over and over save for a couple of episodes.Disc 1""Maude's Problem"":  Maude finds out her daughter Carol is seeing a psychologist. It doesn't seem like it should be as big of an issue as it is here as Maude is so liberal but, I guess when it hits close to home, it's a different story.""Doctor, Doctor"":  Walter's conservative friend Arthur is concerned about Carol's son (who never has much of a role in this season) playing doctor with his granddaughter and this starts an argument about sexual freedom with Maude.""Maude Meets Florida"": Maude hires Florida Evans as her cleaning woman and goes overboard making her feel like an equal.  This is one of the better episodes.""Like Mother, Like Daughter"": Maude is angry that Carol is dating an older man...a man she used to date.""Maude and the Radical"": Maude hopes to impress a famous black militant leader at a fundraising party but the guests all leave before he arrives.""The Ticket"": This is one of the silliest episodes, I think.  Maude receives a speeding ticket and insists on going to court to fight it even after Arthur gets her ticket ""fixed."" The scenes with the young traffic officer are so silly they're almost painful to watch.""Love and Marriage"": Carol announces she is going to ask her boyfriend, whom she does not love but is a very handsome older man, to marry her so she and her son can leave Maude's house.  The dish-breaking scene is a little over-the-top but I found out that breaking things is one of the ways the Findlays air out their differences and it also caused Carol to re-consider her plans.""Flashback"":  Maude and Walter watch the Nixon-McGovern election returns and reminisce about the 1968 Nixon-Humphrey election when they were going together and questioning their future.Disc 2""Maude's Dilemma Parts 1 & 2"": Maude finds out she's pregnant at 47.  Abortion, vasectomy are all discussed, although the moral implications of abortion are not really examined.""Maude's Reunion"": Maude's college friend visits and the former mousey girl with an overbite is now stunning and Vice President of Avon.  Maude begins to consider what she has done with her life and, ironically, defends the traditional wife/mother role.  Seems out of character.""Grass Story"":  Maude is intent on bringing marijuana to a police station so she and a group of liberal housewives can protest a local kid facing jail time for possession.  Walter is against her plans but Maude will get her way.  Interesting ending as even the police chief sympathizes with Maude's cause.  One of the better episodes.""The Slumlord"": Walter is a member of a syndicate that purchased property that has a tenement.  A black man pickets the Findlays' house with a ""Slumlord"" sign.""The Convention"":  Maude and Walter are in a hotel room getting ready for Walter's Maytag convention and they have a lengthy argument about the worth of men and women in society.  I don't think this episode goes anywhere.  Walter is already a liberal man.  It seemed boring and pointless.""Walter's 50th Birthday"": An old friend dies at Walter's 50th Birthday party and Walter faces his mortality.Disc 3""Maude and the Medical Profession"": Maude and Walter plan a second honeymoon trip to Italy and Maude gets a rash.  Arthur recommends a dermatologist (Tom Bosley) who doesn't give Maude proper directions for pills.  Maude gets in a car accident due to the side effects and misses the trip so she and Walter try to convince Arthur to testify against the doctor in court.  As a fellow doctor, Arthur worries about his reputation if he were to testify.  The ending seemed rushed and unsatisfying to me.""Arthur Moves In"": Arthur stays at the Findlays' while his house is being repaired for fire damage and Maude is jealous of the time he and Walter spend together.""Florida's Problem"": Florida's husband (John Amos) gets a second job because he doesn't want his wife working for a white family.  He and Walter then go on a powertrip but are soon put in their place.""Walter's Secret"": Carol sees Walter with a woman at a cocktail lounge at the Holiday Inn.  Walter then confesses his mid-life crisis.""Maude's Good Deed"": Maude tries to reunite an old sorority friend with her estranged daughter who is fighting with her over her inheritance.  Things don't quite go as Maude plans.  Carol sides with the daughter but we don't really learn enough about the inheritance issue to figure which side is right.""The Perfect Marriage"":  Back from a Jamaican vacation, Maude and Walter's best friends Vivan (Rue McClanahan) and Chuck announce they are getting a divorce.  Maude and Walter begin to question their own compatibility.  More things get broken.""Maude's Night Out"": Maude and Walter get ready for a dinner party and the entire episode they argue about the host's ""furtive glances at Maude's fabulous fanny"" and other issues.  This episode reminds me of ""The Convention"" as there are only two actors in the whole episode, a lot of dialog, and one setting (though they move between the bathroom and bedroom).  I found the interior d&eacute;cor and all that wallpaper interesting to look at.  This episode is very funny.  I like how Maude totally disses certain women and then in the next sentence says how good of friends they are.  It's also fun to see her totally change her opinion of a couple by the end of the episode.  I also like when she pulls off the piece of tissue paper on Walter's shaved face and says, ""Bleed, Walter.""

This was humorously exemplified in the show's classic opening theme song performed by Donny Hathaway.The show's most controversial episode was the two-part ""Maude's Dilemma"" where Maude, at age 47, discovers she pregnant. After much debate she decides to have an abortion. This made ""Maude"" the first show to ever have the lead character make that decision. Though some viewers picketed and protested over the topic and subject matter, CBS ultimately found a 6-1 audience reaction IN FAVOR of the subject matter and how the topic was resolved. It was viewership like this that helped ""Maude"" crack Nielsen's Top Ten in each of its first four seasons.The show's stellar supporting cast includes Bill Macy as Walter Finlay, Maude's current husband and owner of Finlay's Friendly Appliances; Adrienne Barbeau (Drew Carey, Batman: TAS) as Carol Traynor, Maude's divorced daughter, who lived with the Finlays; Conrad Bain (Diff'rent Strokes) as Dr. Arthur Harmon, the Finlay's conservative neighbor and Walter's best friend; Brian Morrison as Phillip, Carol's son; and Esther Rolle & John Amos as Florida & James Evans, Maude's black maid and her husband respectively who would spin-off into their own series ""Good Times"" in January of 1974. Rue McClanahan, who played Maude's best friend Vivian joined the cast in the show's second season.Sony Home Entertainment celebrates the show's 35th anniversary March 20th with the release of ""Maude - The Complete First Season.""

Funny how Maude was never really shown often enough in syndication when I was growing up. That's why I really bought the DVD because it never aired in reruns like it's sister show, All in the Family. Maude Findlay is the female version of Archie Bunker but she's a liberal feminist and married to the fourth time to Walter Findlay, the owner of an appliance store. She lives in Tuckahoe, New York, a wealthy suburb north of New York City. Maude was introduced on All in the Family, the other Lear show that spawned several others. In the first season, we meet Maude and Walter who have been married for four years. We are introduced to Maude's divorced daughter and single mom, Carol Trainor, played by Adrienne Barbeau. Carol has a son, Phillip, but we never really see him or really need him. THe show is for the adults. We also are introduced to Dr. Arthur Harmon played none other than by Conrad Bain, the father from Different Strokes. Arthur is Walter's friend and a neighbor who introduced Walter and Maude to each other but Arthur is the opposite of Maude. Arthur is a conservative. Nevertheless, the two manage to get along despite their obvious differences. We also meet Florida Evans and her husband, Henry, which was later changed to James for Good Times. Maude's first season is strong and the fact that two episodes focused solely on the relationship between Maude and Walter shows how great writing, directing, and acting is enough. Maude's dilemma (abortion) is met with great compassion, discretion, and left us wanting more. In fact, the abortion was never mentioned except that she didn't have to have the baby at 47 years old. For all we know, she could have miscarried and since a baby could be dangerous to her health at that age. Anyway, the cast is first rate.

1046528,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000MGTQ6G,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[7, 8]","The character of Maude Findlay made her first public appearance on an episode of the #1 rated show in the country ""All In The Family"" way back in the fall of 1971. Immediately Norman Lear and CBS wanted to spin the character off in her own series. Beatrice Arthur became Maude or Maude became Beatrice, but whatever the case Maude was a character way before her time. An open-minded, liberated woman, Maude wanted equal rights for all including women, blacks, and gays. Maude was never dull and she was never shy by giving her opinion, but underneath that hard exterior was a loveable and giving creature that found her way into the hearts of millions of Americans watching TV in the 1970's. This beautiful boxset contains all 22 episodes from the first season that aired on CBS between 1972-1973 and they are even more enjoyable to watch now than they were during their original airings. ""Maude"" finished its first year on the air as the #4 rated show with 16.0 million viewers tuned in week after week. The series actually played out like a dramedy as many topical issues were tackled by the series' writers, the most famous of which was a two part episode that dealt with Maude discovering she was pregnant in her late forties and her decision on whether to abort the unborn child. These shows were written by future ""Golden Girls"" creator Susan Harris. Never before had a sitcom explored such controversial topics with excellent writing and acting wrapped up in a 30 minute package. Not even ""All in The Family"" was this good. Sadly, this first season of ""Maude"" on DVD did not sell well and there has been no announcement if Sony will release any future seasons. Write to Sony and tell them that more boxsets of this topical sitcom need to be released. ""Maude"" was and continues to be one of the greatest television shows to be broadcast on American television and other generations should be allowed the pleasure of viewing it.",5,"""...and then there's Maude!""",1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,1933,"['character', 'Maude', 'Findlay', 'made', 'first', 'public', 'appearance', 'episode', '1', 'rated', 'show', 'country', 'Family', 'way', 'back', 'fall', '1971', 'Immediately', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'CBS', 'wanted', 'spin', 'character', 'off', 'own', 'series', 'Beatrice', 'Arthur', 'became', 'Maude', 'Maude', 'became', 'Beatrice', 'case', 'Maude', 'was', 'character', 'way', 'time', 'open-minded', 'liberated', 'woman', 'Maude', 'wanted', 'equal', 'rights', 'including', 'women', 'blacks', 'gays', 'Maude', 'was', 'never', 'dull', 'was', 'never', 'shy', 'giving', 'opinion', 'hard', 'exterior', 'was', 'loveable', 'giving', 'creature', 'found', 'way', 'hearts', 'millions', 'Americans', 'watching', 'TV', '1970', 'beautiful', 'boxset', '22', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'aired', 'CBS', '1972-1973', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'now', 'were', 'original', 'airings', 'Maude', 'finished', 'first', 'year', 'air', '4', 'rated', 'show', '16.0', 'million', 'viewers', 'tuned', 'week', 'week', 'series', 'actually', 'played', 'out', 'dramedy', 'many', 'topical', 'issues', 'were', 'tackled', 'series', 'writers', 'most', 'famous', 'was', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'dealt', 'Maude', 'discovering', 'was', 'pregnant', 'late', 'forties', 'decision', 'abort', 'unborn', 'child', 'shows', 'were', 'written', 'future', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'creator', 'Susan', 'Harris', 'Never', 'had', 'sitcom', 'explored', 'such', 'controversial', 'topics', 'excellent', 'writing', 'acting', 'wrapped', 'up', '30', 'minute', 'package', 'Not', 'even', 'Family', 'was', 'good', 'Sadly', 'first', 'season', 'Maude', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'sell', 'well', 'there', 'been', 'announcement', 'Sony', 'will', 'release', 'future', 'seasons', 'Write', 'Sony', 'tell', 'more', 'boxsets', 'topical', 'sitcom', 'need', 'be', 'released', 'Maude', 'was', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'television', 'shows', 'be', 'broadcast', 'American', 'television', 'other', 'generations', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'pleasure', 'viewing']",Maude: Season 1

But almost forty some years later as the networks and TV writers continue to insult our intelligence with mindless situation comedies I turn to vintage television from the 60s and 70s to be entertained.I was eleven years old when ""Maude"" made its TV debut in 1972 and while I watched prime time television seven days a week (who didn't back then) ""Maude"" was too ""grown-up"" for me to enjoy.  So it wasn't until its sixth and final season that I began to watch as a teenager and enjoyed it.  I haven't really seen the show since (it has never been popular in syndication) but as I do now with the first season on DVD I am absolutely loving it and needless to say I am begging for MORE!!I can see why some people don't like Bea Arthur as ""Maude.""  She's loudmouthed, always yelling and screaming, and not always very lady-like. But if she weren't then she'd be another boring, typical housewife in a situation comedy ala Donna Stone, Shirley Partridge, Doris Martin or Marion Cunningham.  I see enough of that all the time.  With ""Maude"" I am guaranteed to be thoroughly entertained by a sudden outburst of exaggerated emotions, a great facial expression with a hand in her mouth or another ""God'll get you for that"" line thrown at someone in Maude's path.  There's nobody else like her and in hard and bad times I need that!!The episode where Arther must move in with the Findleys after a housefire is one of the funniest episodes on season one.  Arthur is driving Maude mad with his constant demands and as she's cooking bacon strips and poached eggs in the kitchen one morning you half expect Walter to end up with something on his bald head.  It turns out Maude becomes jealous of all the time Walter is spending with Arthur and finally loses it as she holds a toy machine gun in her hands and starts imitating James Cagney shooting fake bullets at everybody.  I think the neighbors must have heard me laughing my head off at 1 AM in the morning as I watched this episode!  It was so funny.I am just about finished with season one and it's rather sad that there's no sign of a Season Two DVD release in the near future.  I would definitely spend whatever it takes to get the complete series on DVD and that's saying a lot about a show.  If you like and want to see ""Maude"" please post a review so that the powers can be can read how much interest there is.  I can also say that watching Bea Arthur as ""Maude"" makes me want to start watching and collecting all seasons of ""The Golden Girls,"" a show I was never that crazy about during its original run.",5,"More ""Maude,"" please!!",1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,2605,"['Maude', ""n't"", 'show', 'everyone', 'fine', 'almost', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'networks', 'TV', 'writers', 'continue', 'insult', 'intelligence', 'mindless', 'situation', 'comedies', 'turn', 'vintage', 'television', '60s', '70s', 'be', 'entertained.I', 'was', 'eleven', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Maude', 'made', 'TV', 'debut', '1972', 'watched', 'prime', 'time', 'television', 'seven', 'days', 'week', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'back', 'then', 'Maude', 'was', 'too', 'grown-up', 'enjoy', 'was', ""n't"", 'sixth', 'final', 'season', 'began', 'watch', 'teenager', 'enjoyed', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'seen', 'show', 'never', 'been', 'popular', 'syndication', 'do', 'now', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'am', 'absolutely', 'loving', 'needless', 'say', 'am', 'begging', 'MORE', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Bea', 'Arthur', 'Maude', 'loudmouthed', 'always', 'yelling', 'screaming', 'not', 'always', 'very', 'lady-like', 'were', ""n't"", 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'boring', 'typical', 'housewife', 'situation', 'comedy', 'Donna', 'Stone', 'Shirley', 'Partridge', 'Doris', 'Martin', 'Marion', 'Cunningham', 'see', 'enough', 'time', 'Maude', 'am', 'guaranteed', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'sudden', 'outburst', 'exaggerated', 'emotions', 'great', 'facial', 'expression', 'hand', 'mouth', 'God', ""'ll"", 'get', 'line', 'thrown', 'someone', 'Maude', 'path', 'nobody', 'else', 'hard', 'bad', 'times', 'need', 'episode', 'where', 'Arther', 'must', 'move', 'Findleys', 'housefire', 'one', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'Arthur', 'driving', 'Maude', 'mad', 'constant', 'demands', 'cooking', 'bacon', 'strips', 'poached', 'eggs', 'kitchen', 'one', 'morning', 'half', 'expect', 'Walter', 'end', 'up', 'something', 'bald', 'head', 'out', 'Maude', 'jealous', 'time', 'Walter', 'spending', 'Arthur', 'finally', 'toy', 'machine', 'gun', 'hands', 'imitating', 'James', 'Cagney', 'shooting', 'fake', 'bullets', 'everybody', 'think', 'neighbors', 'must', 'have', 'heard', 'laughing', 'head', '1', 'AM', 'morning', 'watched', 'episode', 'was', 'so', 'funny.I', 'am', 'just', 'finished', 'season', 'one', 'rather', 'sad', 'sign', 'Season', 'Two', 'DVD', 'release', 'near', 'future', 'would', 'definitely', 'spend', 'get', 'complete', 'series', 'DVD', 'saying', 'lot', 'show', 'like', 'want', 'see', 'Maude', 'please', 'post', 'review', 'powers', 'can', 'be', 'can', 'read', 'how', 'much', 'interest', 'can', 'also', 'say', 'watching', 'Bea', 'Arthur', 'Maude', 'want', 'start', 'watching', 'collecting', 'seasons', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'crazy', 'original', 'run']",Maude: Season 1
1046530,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B000MGTQ6G,The Wingchair Critic,"[17, 20]","Norman Lear's seminal television series 'Maude' (1972-1978) harks back to a time when American adults were still adults, people freely and fearlessly spoke their minds, and the modern scourge of political correctness did not exist.Lear revolutionized American television with 'All In The Family' (1971-1979), which introduced audiences to bigoted conservative Queens resident Archie Bunker in an era when most viewers where still tuning in for pleasant rural fantasies like 'Mayberry R.F.D.' and established series with magical premises like 'Bewitched' (1964-1972).Where television comedies of the previous decade, from 'Mr. Ed' (1961-1966) to 'Hazel' (1961-1966), had emphasized genteel good manners and upper middle class respectability, All In The Family, with its coarse blue collar protagonist and his 'dingbat' wife, Edith, hit the ground running by boldly tackling themes of racism, anti-Semitism, rape, homosexuality, women's liberation, breast cancer, and impotence.Rumored to have been based on Lear's wife Frances, Maude Findlay originally debuted on All In The Family in a passing role as Edith Bunker's cousin. Maude was the diametric opposite of Archie Bunker: upper middle class, feminist, educated, intelligent, and, above all, liberal.Brilliantly portrayed by Beatrice Arthur, Lear wisely realized that he had television gold on his hands, and 'Maude' soared into primetime, as instant and controversial a success as All In The Family had been a year earlier. Arthur's commanding presence, impeccable comic timing, and blatant intellect cast an instant shadow across the entertainment landscape of the country, making 'Maude' one the decade's most recognizable icons.Dressed in her slightly eccentric trademark ensemble of a kneelength open vest over a blouse, a neckerchief, and a pair of loose trousers, the tall, confrontational, never less-than-assertive Maude, with her unruly steel-gray hair, hilariously roars through each episode,  bellowing, hollering, and reducing her antagonists to rubble like a prototypical Japanese monster.Like All In The Family, 'Maude' would embrace mature themes like racism, abortion, spousal abuse, alcoholism, and mental illness (in a later season, Maude is revealed to suffer from manic-depression after becoming obsessed with the idea that screen legend Henry Fonda should become America's next president) head-on in a responsible but consistently entertaining manner. 'Maude' was a program created largely for adults and watched largely by adults; children and teenagers were unlikely to find it interesting.As the characters in Woody Allen's later films 'Annie Hall' (1977) and 'Manhattan' (1979) would, Maude, her husband Walter (Bill Macy), and other adult cast members blithely take subscription pills to stabilize their moods, while the ritual of evening cocktails is an essential component of the Findlay's daily lives. There are very few episodes in the first season in which Maude, Walter, or physician-neighbor Arthur (Conrad Bain) don't reach for a drink as soon as tempers begin to flare.Perhaps these habits explain the continually worn-out, beaten-down look of the cast, the repulsive clothing worn by everyone, the women's taste-free hairstyles, and the relatively tacky interior of the Findlay manse.Or perhaps Lear was partially attempting to underscore the 'realism' of his program: the grooming, dress, and decor found in 'Maude' are leagues away from the polished standard established by earlier Fifties and Sixties television series from 'Leave It To Beaver' (1957-1963) and 'My Favorite Martian' (1963-1966) to 'That Girl' and 'Family Affair' (both 1966-1971).This is particularly unlikely to be the case, however, since most of the show's production values are equally poor, a trend which would unfortunately sweep Seventies television and not be rectified until the late Eighties and early-to-mid Nineties with dramas like 'Thirtysomething' (1987-1991), 'Twin Peaks' (1990-1991), 'Northern Exposure' (1990-1195), and 'Picket Fences' (1992-1996).But 'Maude' was always about intellectual substance rather than visual style, and if he couldn't reflect both qualities equally, Lear certainly made the right choice, as 'Maude,' via the complexity of the writing,  characterization, and superb acting by Arthur, remains the never-bettered situation comedy of its kind.",5,The 70s Feminist As Suburban Godzilla,1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,4345,"['Norman', 'Lear',

Intelligent, ballsy, shocking, well written, sharp witted, well acted, and extremely funny!Forget modern television, which is essentially constant swearing and bodily functions as the source of 'comedy', this show 'Maude' uses situations - unrelentingly and sublimely so for comedy, which is where real humor emanates from.If I were to sum this show up, I would say ""reversed stereotypes"".  Which isn't the best description, but the characters and plots are so atypical of stereotypes of the time (or now!), there's a certain magic that really stands out and doesn't often date itself despite being made some 34 years ago.And the best part is, it's taped before a live studio audience as well!  The laughs are genuine and there are plenty.The DVD sound and video quality is quite good considering the age and condition of the source videotape.  The only way to improve on it is to put fewer episodes on disc, but that would trade DVD artifacting for seeing the imperfections of the master tapes more clearly.  :)  And at 8 episodes per disc, they really aren't cramming anything.  The mastering is rather good.Definitely worth the buy for 'Maude' fans and at the very least a rent by anyone who loves to rent DVDs and I hope that's a lot of people!  This show, from the first episode onward, is a laugh-RIOT and most of the real life topics presented are just as relevant now as they had back then...But I will say this:  ""Maude's Dilemma"", pt 2 - the epilogue at the end seems to have been edited out.  Badly as the audience clapping doesn't mesh.  Could anybody shed light on this situation?",5,THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!

1046533,A29C8ZP406AGNM,B000MGTQ6G,"TwoBrainedCylon ""MrPostModernist""","[2, 2]","I loved Maude as a kid, because Beatrice Arthur made me laugh even when I didn't understand most of what she was referring to. As an adult, I appreciate the comedic gifts of Beatrice Arthur even more in this series. She is truly one of the greats, and to see her chew up the scenery in every scene and episode of Maude has been a rare treat. This is mega talent unleashed, and Beatrice Arthur can deliver dead pan one liners like no other. I wish that I were fortunate enough to have been in the studio audience during the tapings of Maude to witness Beatrice Arthur's electricity with the studio audience, where Ms. Arthur had to pause momentarily and wait for the hysterical laugher to die down before she delivered the next line. I also give 5 stars to the supporting cast. A younger Adrienne Barbeau being very easy on the eyes while at the same time offering calm stability to her mother during the moments of crisis. Conrad Bain making us realize what a great actor he was before his talents were wasted on Diff'rent Stokes, Esther Rolle as the fed up with bigotry and preferential treatment maid of Maude's, and being a rival of Maude in her own right, and Bill Macy who played Walter, Maude's husband. He too, was a great presence in this series, telling Maude to ""Sit!!"" on numerous occasions when he got fed up with her. To see and hear these four arguing about the issues of the day near the alcohol bar with drinks in their hands has been priceless. I urge the studio to release the other seasons of Maude, as Beatrice Arthur's true gifts as a comedieanne should not be denied to anyone. Everytime Ms. Arthur utters ""God will get you for that Walter"" leaves me in tears from laughing so hard.",5,Beatrice Arthur is one of the true comedic greats,1209513600,"04 30, 2008",2008,1704,"['loved', 'Maude', 'kid', 'Beatrice', 'Arthur', 'made', 'even', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'most', 'what', 'was', 'referring', 'adult', 'appreciate', 'comedic', 'gifts', 'Beatrice', 'Arthur', 'even', 'more', 'series', 'truly', 'one', 'greats', 'see', 'chew', 'scenery', 'scene', 'episode', 'Maude', 'been', 'rare', 'treat', 'mega', 'talent', 'unleashed', 'Beatrice', 'Arthur', 'can', 'deliver', 'dead', 'pan', 'one', 'liners', 'other', 'wish', 'were', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'studio', 'audience', 'tapings', 'Maude', 'witness', 'Beatrice', 'Arthur', 'electricity', 'studio', 'audience', 'where', 'Ms.', 'Arthur', 'had', 'pause', 'momentarily', 'wait', 'hysterical', 'laugher', 'die', 'down', 'delivered', 'next', 'line', 'also', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'supporting', 'cast', 'A', 'younger', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'being', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'same', 'time', 'offering', 'calm', 'stability', 'mother', 'moments', 'crisis', 'Conrad', 'Bain', 'making', 'realize', 'what', 'great', 'actor', 'was', 'talents', 'were', 'wasted', ""Diff'rent"", 'Stokes', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'fed', 'up', 'bigotry', 'preferential', 'treatment', 'maid', 'Maude', 'being', 'rival', 'Maude', 'own', 'right', 'Bill', 'Macy', 'who', 'played', 'Walter', 'Maude', 'husband', 'too', 'was', 'great', 'presence', 'series', 'telling', 'Maude', 'Sit', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'when', 'got', 'fed', 'up', 'see', 'hear', 'four', 'arguing', 'issues', 'day', 'alcohol', 'bar', 'drinks', 'hands', 'been', 'priceless', 'urge', 'studio', 'release', 'other', 'seasons', 'Maude', 'Beatrice', 'Arthur', 'true', 'gifts', 'comedieanne', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'anyone', 'Everytime', 'Ms.', 'Arthur', 'God', 'will', 'get', 'Walter', 'tears', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard']",Maude: Season 1
