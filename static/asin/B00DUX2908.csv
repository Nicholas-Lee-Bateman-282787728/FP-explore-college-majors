1661471,AZ4JHTB28WC39,B00DUX2908,Criterion Collector,"[0, 0]","The DVD contains the one-hour program plus a few extras.  The extras mostly have to do with the making of the program itself.  I was hoping for more historical extras on the DVD; at the very least a recording of the broadcast.The program includes dramatizations of comments sent in by listeners at the time.  These are somewhat interesting since they are first-person accounts from people who were seriously frightened by the radio show.  The presentation is a little strange since they are shot as interviews in period dress, on a period-furnished set.  I was a bit confused at first until I realized that they had to be present-day actors.  Some of them chew the scenery a bit, which seems over the top.  I guess not even PBS is immune from the pressure to put these staged re-enactments into documentaries that in former days would only use historical material.Overall, though, this is still worth watching if you are interested in this episode and/or Orson Welles.",4,Not bad but a bit slight,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,968,"['DVD', 'one-hour', 'program', 'few', 'extras', 'extras', 'mostly', 'have', 'do', 'making', 'program', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'historical', 'extras', 'DVD', 'very', 'least', 'recording', 'broadcast.The', 'program', 'dramatizations', 'comments', 'sent', 'listeners', 'time', 'are', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'are', 'first-person', 'accounts', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'seriously', 'frightened', 'radio', 'show', 'presentation', 'little', 'strange', 'are', 'shot', 'interviews', 'period', 'dress', 'period-furnished', 'set', 'was', 'bit', 'confused', 'first', 'realized', 'had', 'be', 'present-day', 'actors', 'chew', 'scenery', 'bit', 'top', 'guess', 'not', 'even', 'PBS', 'immune', 'pressure', 'put', 'staged', 're-enactments', 'documentaries', 'former', 'days', 'would', 'only', 'use', 'historical', 'material.Overall', 'though', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'interested', 'episode', 'Orson', 'Welles']",American Experience: War of the Worlds

1661473,A2DYK9TXWAHW1W,B00DUX2908,J,"[1, 1]","I wish the DVD had the full recording of the radio broadcast of ""The War of the Worlds.""  It is still a good documentary about how a radio drama based on a science fiction story and presented as a live real time news report could produce a panic.  Mostly people who tuned in after the show had started heard only the parts where the Martians were attacking New Jersey and they missed the introduction to the show that explained that it was just a radio drama.  The public reaction after it was realized that it was only a radio play ranged from praise to rage.  The DVD only deals with the events in the United States late in 1938.This was not the only radio dramatization of ""The War of the Worlds,"" there are others not mentioned on the DVD.  The more infamous example was the broadcast during February, 1949 in Quito, Ecuador.  It created a mass panic among the citizens of Quito!  When they learned that it was a radio play, they were not amused.Reportedly a mob formed and a riot broke out.  The building where the radio station was located in was set on fire.  Tragically, a few people were killed as a result.  For more information about this incident, you might enter terms like Quito, ""War of the Worlds, and ""radio hoax"" into the search engine of your choice.",4,A Demonstration of the Influence of Mass Media,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,1269,"['wish', 'DVD', 'had', 'full', 'recording', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'War', 'Worlds', 'still', 'good', 'documentary', 'how', 'radio', 'drama', 'based', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'presented', 'live', 'real', 'time', 'news', 'report', 'could', 'produce', 'panic', 'Mostly', 'people', 'who', 'tuned', 'show', 'had', 'started', 'heard', 'only', 'parts', 'where', 'Martians', 'were', 'attacking', 'New', 'Jersey', 'missed', 'introduction', 'show', 'explained', 'was', 'just', 'radio', 'drama', 'public', 'reaction', 'was', 'realized', 'was', 'only', 'radio', 'play', 'ranged', 'praise', 'rage', 'DVD', 'only', 'deals', 'events', 'United', 'States', 'late', '1938.This', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'radio', 'dramatization', 'War', 'Worlds', 'are', 'others', 'not', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'more', 'infamous', 'example', 'was', 'broadcast', 'February', '1949', 'Quito', 'Ecuador', 'created', 'mass', 'panic', 'citizens', 'Quito', 'When', 'learned', 'was', 'radio', 'play', 'were', 'not', 'amused.Reportedly', 'mob', 'formed', 'riot', 'broke', 'out', 'building', 'where', 'radio', 'station', 'was', 'located', 'was', 'set', 'fire', 'Tragically', 'few', 'people', 'were', 'killed', 'result', 'more', 'information', 'incident', 'might', 'enter', 'terms', 'Quito', 'War', 'Worlds', 'radio', 'hoax', 'search', 'engine', 'choice']",American Experience: War of the Worlds

The rogram has a quick scroll of newspaper articles about public reaction to the broadcast.  One is a NYT article about Brevard College in North Carolina (evidently, someone contacted the local newspaper which put the report on a wire service; the article then went, in theory at least, world wide).  Students fainted, and many telephoned parents to take them home.  In a history of the College, it is said President Coltrane of the College received several letters chastising the BC students for being so gullible.",5,Hall of Shame,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,578,"['based', 'broadcast', 'applies', 'DVD', 'also', 'rogram', 'quick', 'scroll', 'newspaper', 'articles', 'public', 'reaction', 'broadcast', 'One', 'NYT', 'article', 'Brevard', 'College', 'North', 'Carolina', 'evidently', 'someone', 'contacted', 'local', 'newspaper', 'put', 'report', 'wire', 'service', 'article', 'then', 'went', 'theory', 'least', 'world', 'wide', 'Students', 'fainted', 'many', 'telephoned', 'parents', 'take', 'home', 'history', 'College', 'said', 'President', 'Coltrane', 'College', 'received', 'several', 'letters', 'chastising', 'BC', 'students', 'being', 'so', 'gullible']",American Experience: War of the Worlds
1661475,A2JAOJLKWYSAIS,B00DUX2908,Stephen,"[3, 3]","This is the story of one of the most famous radio broadcasts in history, perhaps the most famous. It is an essential look at a crucial period in Orson Welles' life, the time between his theatrical accomplishments and his later departure for Hollywood. The 1938 broadcast of the play and subsequent controversy would make Welles an overnight celebrity. The film makes for a very good companion piece to the 1996 documentary called The Battle Over Citizen Kane.The film is well done. I especially appreciated all the old film footage and still photographs. However, I did not much care for the actors who read letters written at the time, though they all did a fine job. In my view, simple voice-overs would have been equally effective, if not more so. Despite that, the film offers a great deal of information regarding a signal event in broadcast history. It is also an important part of the story of the man who would go on to create one of the most influential movies of all time, Citizen Kane.",4,Very Good Companion Piece To The Battle Over Citizen Kane,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,996,"['story', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'history', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'essential', 'look', 'crucial', 'period', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'life', 'time', 'theatrical', 'accomplishments', 'later', 'departure', 'Hollywood', '1938', 'broadcast', 'play', 'subsequent', 'controversy', 'would', 'make', 'Welles', 'overnight', 'celebrity', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'companion', 'piece', '1996', 'documentary', 'called', 'Battle', 'Over', 'Citizen', 'Kane.The', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'old', 'film', 'footage', 'still', 'photographs', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'much', 'care', 'actors', 'who', 'read', 'letters', 'written', 'time', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'view', 'simple', 'voice-overs', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'equally', 'effective', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'information', 'regarding', 'signal', 'event', 'broadcast', 'history', 'also', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'create', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'movies', 'time', 'Citizen', 'Kane']",American Experience: War of the Worlds
