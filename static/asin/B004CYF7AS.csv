I only gave it three stars because it was a bit dated, either after the 3rd season or early into the fourth.  Still I wouldrecommend it to Castleoids like myself (and I did) to get an idea of how the actors-actresses are in real life.  I would recommend toABC studios (where the hell are they?) to put on one of  these at the conclusion of each season, sometime early summer.  It wouldmake for some very interesting things to talk about.  Otherwise it was fine.  All the important cast members were there though Iam not a fan of &#34;Martha&#34;.  They seemed to  suggest that if Castle and Beckett get married that Martha the Moocher will continueto live there in the Loft.  Bad Idea.  It is not good to have an in-law living with the married couple. particularly newlyweds.  Especiallya mother-in-law like Martha.  Martha should move Washington DC, marry Dr Sweets and disappear from the planet.But everyone else there was just fine.  So I do recommend it.  I did purchase this from AMAZON.",3,A VISIT WITH THE CASTLE FAMILY,1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,1138,"['Just', 'watched', 'tonight', 'found', 'very', 'entertaining', 'loved', 'listening', 'fine', 'cast', 'talk', 'series', 'up', 'dateof', 'show', 'only', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'was', 'bit', 'dated', 'either', '3rd', 'season', 'early', 'fourth', 'Still', 'wouldrecommend', 'Castleoids', 'did', 'get', 'idea', 'how', 'actors-actresses', 'are', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'recommend', 'toABC', 'studios', 'where', 'hell', 'are', 'put', 'one', 'conclusion', 'season', 'sometime', 'early', 'summer', 'wouldmake', 'very', 'interesting', 'things', 'talk', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'fine', 'important', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'there', 'Iam', 'not', 'fan', '34', 'Martha', '34', 'seemed', 'suggest', 'Castle', 'Beckett', 'get', 'married', 'Martha', 'Moocher', 'will', 'continueto', 'live', 'there', 'Loft', 'Bad', 'Idea', 'not', 'good', 'have', 'in-law', 'living', 'married', 'couple', 'particularly', 'newlyweds', 'Especiallya', 'mother-in-law', 'Martha', 'Martha', 'should', 'move', 'Washington', 'DC', 'marry', 'Dr', 'Sweets', 'disappear', 'planet.But', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'just', 'fine', 'So', 'do', 'recommend', 'did', 'purchase', 'AMAZON']",The Mentalist: Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center

Simon Baker is naturally entertaining, which helps explain why he is such a good actor. I love that he brings his mom along on these things (even got her a bit part in ""The Affair of the Necklace"") and seems to love acknowledging her presence. Very endearing. The other cast members were also interesting to listen to, especially Robin Tunney.

The cast is pretty well chosen and I do enjoy the series.  Not so brutal as &#34;Rome&#34; which was inspired but left me a bit queasy.  I'm not sure about recommending this dvd since it  was made a long time before the series became so popular around the world.

1396397,A21GPR0JNQ9NPP,B004CYF7AS,"Warren Liebold ""WLNYC""","[5, 5]","Here's my suggestion if you're a fan but a bit cheap.  Watch it instantly ($1.99) as opposed to buying the disk.The conversation is enjoyable and well worth watching but hard-core fans will leave unsatisfied.  First, the program appears to have been taped after the first season but before the second, so there are a number of sub-plots (Rigsby and Van Pelt's relationship and Lisbon's one-night stand) that had been filmed but very consciously not referred to.  There's no discussion of the subtleties of character development, the balance between Patrick's Jane's charm and (sometimes) annoying arrogance nor most of the other story telling features that make the show pretty sophisticated and standing above what it might have been if the writing and character development weren't so advanced.  This would have been much better if taped after the second season and even more so after the third.  There would be far more to discuss.The cast, particularly Tunney and Yeoman, are really charming and funny and Heller is a wonderful nerd.If you hadn't already figured it out, you'll learn the make of the car Patrick Jane drives.If you're a fan you'll find this well worth your time, you'll enjoy it but understand that if taped at another time you'd enjoy it more.
