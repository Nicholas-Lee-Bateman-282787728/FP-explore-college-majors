909800,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B0009OUBAQ,Israel Drazin,"[1, 1]","BBC detective mysteries are very interesting to watch because of the plots and the character actors. Actors are not chosen because of the actor's good looks. A Touch of Frost is one of the best. Frost is considered an expert in solving crimes, but like all humans he is flawed. He tends to want to do things his own way. He has little or no respect for his superior officers. He is like a bull dog that snatches hold of a person and doesn't let go. He is persistent in this way with his cases. Series 7 and 8 contain two parts each, meaning that each has a three hour mystery. In series 7, for example, there are three plots. First, someone is killing animals and shooting at articles and apparently is responsible for one or more deaths. Second, a police detective is shot. He was part of a special unit trying to capture car thieves. Frost wants to handle the case and has a run-in with the head of the unit. It soon seems that either one of the car thieves, another officer of the unit, or the dead man's wife killed him. The third plot focuses on Frost's personal life. He and his girl friend try to establish a relationship again. The problem is that Frost repeatedly promises that he will meet her at a certain time, but doesn't show up because he discovers something he must do about his case.",5,BBC detective mysteries are great and Frost is one of the best,1312502400,"08 5, 2011",2011,1300,"['BBC', 'detective', 'mysteries', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'plots', 'character', 'actors', 'Actors', 'are', 'not', 'chosen', 'actor', 'good', 'looks', 'Touch', 'Frost', 'one', 'best', 'Frost', 'considered', 'expert', 'solving', 'crimes', 'humans', 'flawed', 'want', 'do', 'things', 'own', 'way', 'little', 'respect', 'superior', 'officers', 'bull', 'dog', 'hold', 'person', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'persistent', 'way', 'cases', 'Series', '7', '8', 'contain', 'two', 'parts', 'meaning', 'three', 'hour', 'mystery', 'series', '7', 'example', 'are', 'three', 'plots', 'First', 'someone', 'killing', 'animals', 'shooting', 'articles', 'apparently', 'responsible', 'one', 'more', 'deaths', 'Second', 'police', 'detective', 'shot', 'was', 'part', 'special', 'unit', 'trying', 'capture', 'car', 'thieves', 'Frost', 'handle', 'case', 'run-in', 'head', 'unit', 'soon', 'one', 'car', 'thieves', 'officer', 'unit', 'dead', 'man', 'wife', 'killed', 'third', 'plot', 'focuses', 'Frost', 'personal', 'life', 'girl', 'friend', 'try', 'establish', 'relationship', 'again', 'problem', 'Frost', 'repeatedly', 'will', 'meet', 'certain', 'time', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'something', 'must', 'do', 'case']",A Touch of Frost: Seasons 7 & 8
