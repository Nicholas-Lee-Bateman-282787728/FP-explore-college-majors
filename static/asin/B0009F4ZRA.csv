The acting is good by Bobby, Leslie Nielsen, Charles McGrath and Donnelly Rhodes.  I never tire of watching it just to see Bobby in action and in a white shirt that is cut down to his waist!  Had to give it 5 stars just because Darin is in it.

It is not even a classic western. But it's got Darin who is solid, if not spectacular as the sheriff. Leslie Nielsen is his old reliable self as the bad guy and Emily Banks should have had a lot more roles directed her way.If you are looking for a message, something you can analyze to the...ZZZZZ...Ooops, sorry!, then this movie is not for you.

904713,A36B0RD7ZPVRX0,B0009F4ZRA,Parisonn of Atlantis,"[4, 6]","""Gunfight in Abilene"" is a faithful re-make of 1956's ""Showdown at Abilene."" Why anyone would choose to make another movie of this minor material, and why anyone would then decide to cast Bobby Darin in the role once played by Jock Mahoney, are mysteries for which there may be no solutions. By 1967, B-westerns had about run their course but as B-westerns go, this is competently made, despite its central miscasting, with occasional flashes of interest along the way. It has a pleasing song, (heard through the opening credits), which was written by Darin and it has a scene in which Michael Sarrazin is stripped to the waist, tied to the back of a wagon, and flogged. In the book, ""Lash! The Hundred Great Scenes of Men Being Whipped in the Movies,"" this flogging ranks 58th. Otherwise, there's not much here to recommend but fans of B-westerns will probably find this ""Gunfight"" tolerable.",3,Bobby Darin in a western?,1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,893,"['Gunfight', 'Abilene', 'faithful', 're-make', '1956', 'Showdown', 'Abilene', 'Why', 'anyone', 'would', 'choose', 'make', 'movie', 'minor', 'material', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'then', 'decide', 'cast', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'role', 'once', 'played', 'Jock', 'Mahoney', 'are', 'mysteries', 'may', 'be', 'solutions', '1967', 'B-westerns', 'had', 'run', 'course', 'B-westerns', 'go', 'competently', 'made', 'central', 'miscasting', 'occasional', 'flashes', 'interest', 'way', 'pleasing', 'song', 'heard', 'opening', 'credits', 'was', 'written', 'Darin', 'scene', 'Michael', 'Sarrazin', 'stripped', 'waist', 'tied', 'back', 'wagon', 'flogged', 'book', 'Lash', 'Hundred', 'Great', 'Scenes', 'Men', 'Being', 'Whipped', 'Movies', 'flogging', '58th', 'Otherwise', 'not', 'much', 'here', 'recommend', 'fans', 'B-westerns', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'Gunfight', 'tolerable']",Gunfight in Abilene
