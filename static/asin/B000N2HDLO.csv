1052425,A3LIW0F51A9WNP,B000N2HDLO,D. DiPaola,"[2, 2]","21 years ago, a video game was released starring a heroic, fiesty, blue hedgehog. His name was Sonic and quickly became a video game icon. A year later, a sequel was released featuring the debut of his trusty sidekick, Tails and again became a hit. Another year later, in the Fall of 1993, as a result of being so popular, Sonic finally got his own cartoon; Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog! As a fan of Sonic, I gotta say out of all the cartoons, this is the best one! It has a perfect mix of action and comedy, a wonderful and faithful adaptation of the first 2 Sonic games, and really captures the essence of Sonic. AOSTH Sonic is my favorite Sonic, because he's heroic, smart, and wacky! He's a complete screwball in this one and I love it (like a mix of Mickey, Bugs, Woody Woodpecker, and classic Daffy. There's not better Sonic than a screwball Sonic)! Take it from me, AOSTH is true Sonic spirit and quirky, smart, and fun for everyone and should you buy it on DVD, get the Shout!

1052428,A9YA983MXKCEL,B000N2HDLO,"Gregory Bartz ""Gregorius""","[9, 41]","For those of you who don't know, there have thus far been no less than four Sonic the Hedgehog cartoons: Sonic the Hedgehog, also known as SatAM; the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, also known as AoSTH; Sonic Underground; and Sonic X. I'm familiar with all four of them, as well as the histories behind them, so trust me when I say that this is the worst of all four. It was originally slated to be THE Sonic cartoon, but it sucked so badly that some of the Powers That Be decided to reject it and create something better, which eventually became SatAM. The Sonic comic books at the time started out being much like AoSTH, but eventually turned toward the more dramatic, intelligent, character-driven storytelling of SatAM. Years later, when Sonic Underground was being made, the Powers That Be also recognized the infinite superiority of SatAM over AoSTH, and accordingly made Underground more like the former than like the latter. As a result, it ended up being second best (arguably first, even) of the four. Sonic X was little more than an English-dubbed version of a Japanese show, the sole purpose of which was to serve as a half-hour advertisement for the Sonic games for the Dreamcast; although it was quite boring and completely devoid of substance, it was not as excruciatingly painful to watch as AoSTH, it remained popular enough to last a half-dozen seasons, and it even paid token tribute to characters like Knuckles and Amy, placing it (in my opinion) third out of four, though you might find AoSTH more entertaining than Sonic X if you are amused by really bad attempts at humor.Network executives, comic book-writers, and fans agree: SatAM and Underground are better than AoSTH.",1,Worst of all four Sonic cartoons,1208908800,"04 23, 2008",2008,1697,"['who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'thus', 'far', 'been', 'no', 'less', 'four', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog', 'cartoons', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog', 'also', 'known', 'SatAM', 'Adventures', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog', 'also', 'known', 'AoSTH', 'Sonic', 'Underground', 'Sonic', 'X.', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'four', 'as', 'well', 'histories', 'so', 'when', 'say', 'worst', 'four', 'was', 'originally', 'slated', 'be', 'THE', 'Sonic', 'cartoon', 'sucked', 'so', 'badly', 'Powers', 'Be', 'decided', 'reject', 'create', 'something', 'better', 'eventually', 'became', 'SatAM', 'Sonic', 'comic', 'books', 'time', 'started', 'out', 'being', 'much', 'AoSTH', 'eventually', 'turned', 'more', 'dramatic', 'intelligent', 'character-driven', 'storytelling', 'SatAM', 'Years', 'later', 'when', 'Sonic', 'Underground', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'Powers', 'Be', 'also', 'recognized', 'infinite', 'superiority', 'SatAM', 'AoSTH', 'accordingly', 'made', 'Underground', 'more', 'former', 'latter', 'result', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'second', 'best', 'arguably', 'first', 'even', 'four', 'Sonic', 'X', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'English-dubbed', 'version', 'Japanese', 'show', 'sole', 'purpose', 'was', 'serve', 'half-hour', 'advertisement', 'Sonic', 'games', 'Dreamcast', 'was', 'quite', 'boring', 'completely', 'devoid', 'substance', 'was', 'not', 'excruciatingly', 'painful', 'watch', 'AoSTH', 'remained', 'popular', 'enough', 'last', 'half-dozen', 'seasons', 'even', 'paid', 'token', 'tribute', 'characters', 'Knuckles', 'Amy', 'placing', 'opinion', 'four', 'might', 'find', 'AoSTH', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Sonic', 'X', 'are', 'amused', 'really', 'bad', 'attempts', 'humor.Network', 'executives', 'comic', 'book-writers', 'fans', 'agree', 'SatAM', 'Underground', 'are', 'better', 'AoSTH']",N/A

You won't believe how weird the storylines are (""I created a robot to destroy all music!""), and you gotta love how Sonic actually disguises himself to trick Robotnik's two minions (Scratch and Grounder) most of the time.
