I was happy they added a calm sense of purpose; like they are there to help and not just check it out for a night and then say adios. I also liked that they brought God into it as well. They seemed legit.THEN, I saw this and season 5...I was so incredibly disgusted. Buell went from being basically about PRS to grand standing every chance he got. Running around sqwacking to ghosts that he'd had negative encounters.  Just basically ACTING.  Period. Also, Chip Coffy wasn't in it even half as much from the 4th season on....I liked him and he helped make the show what it was.Someone reviewed that Choffy was a fraud, and Buell was a basic moron. I don't know the truth about either. I do think Buell writing a book about himself while still in his 20's is a tad egotistical, but Coffy being a fraud, you'd have to prove it to me. Either way, they'll have to answer to their own consciences.Basically, I'd DEF stop watching after the 3rd season...the rest is tripe and annoying as all get out.

Google ""Paranormal state fraud"" and/or ""Chip Coffey fraud"" and just research for a few minutes the many hits that will come up.2.  Read about the two former clients that have come forward with claims of fraud Episodes ""The Messenger"" and ""Hell House"" I believe.  One of their former clients is a self proclaimed psychic.  However before you dismiss her complaints as trying to get ""15 minutes more of fame"" read the whole story.  She was one of the clients in a episode called "" The Messenger"".This episode had so much evidence that was, let's just say, unfavorable to PRS's credibility that this episode, despite been listed by Amazon as being on the second DVD of Season Two, had been removed from the DVD and you will NOT find it anywhere on Season Two.  The unhappy client posted small parts of that episode on YouTube.  All the posts were quickly removed for ""legal reasons"", despite the fact that other episodes on YouTube have not been as closely guarded by the producers of PRS.3.  A lot of evidence (to say the least) has surfaced showing that Chip Coffey is briefed well in advance and in great detail by the producers about all the facts on the cases before every showing up on the set.  These are the exact same facts he will later use his ""psychic"" powers to sense.4.  If you search the IMDB website on Chip Coffey, you will find out that he is, and has been, a professional actor all of his life.5.  An entire website has been devoted to exposing PRS as frauds, using their own EVP's and video footage.  I cannot list the link here, however if you look up Paranormal State in Wikipedia you will find the site that has captured all of this shows frauds in the references section their Paranormal State page.Hope this helps.",1,Why I think they are fakes,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,1790,"['buy', 'suggest', 'doing', 'following:1', 'Google', 'Paranormal', 'state', 'fraud', 'and/or', 'Chip', 'Coffey', 'fraud', 'just', 'research', 'few', 'minutes', 'many', 'hits', 'will', 'come', 'up.2', 'Read', 'two', 'former', 'clients', 'have', 'come', 'forward', 'claims', 'fraud', 'Episodes', 'Messenger', 'Hell', 'House', 'believe', 'One', 'former', 'clients', 'self', 'proclaimed', 'psychic', 'However', 'dismiss', 'complaints', 'trying', 'get', '15', 'minutes', 'more', 'fame', 'read', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'clients', 'episode', 'called', 'Messenger', '.This', 'episode', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'evidence', 'was', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'unfavorable', 'PRS', 'credibility', 'episode', 'been', 'listed', 'Amazon', 'being', 'second', 'DVD', 'Season', 'Two', 'had', 'been', 'removed', 'DVD', 'will', 'NOT', 'find', 'anywhere', 'Season', 'Two', 'unhappy', 'client', 'posted', 'small', 'parts', 'episode', 'YouTube', 'posts', 'were', 'quickly', 'removed', 'legal', 'reasons', 'fact', 'other', 'episodes', 'YouTube', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'closely', 'guarded', 'producers', 'PRS.3', 'lot', 'evidence', 'say', 'least', 'surfaced', 'showing', 'Chip', 'Coffey', 'briefed', 'well', 'advance', 'great', 'detail', 'producers', 'facts', 'cases', 'showing', 'up', 'set', 'are', 'exact', 'same', 'will', 'later', 'use', 'psychic', 'powers', 'sense.4', 'search', 'IMDB', 'website', 'Chip', 'Coffey', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'been', 'professional', 'actor', 'life.5', 'entire', 'website', 'been', 'devoted', 'exposing', 'PRS', 'frauds', 'using', 'own', 'EVP', 'video', 'footage', 'can', 'not', 'list', 'link', 'here', 'however', 'look', 'up', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Wikipedia', 'will', 'find', 'site', 'captured', 'frauds', 'references', 'section', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'page.Hope']",N/A

The show is entertaining and scary, which if we are honest, is exactly why we watch these shows in the first place.  Very few people are watching these shows to get an education in ghost hunting.  If you want to be educated, watch Ghost Hunters.  If you want to roll your eyes and watch over-the-top investigating, watch ghost adventures.  If you want to feel the goosebumps on your arms and have trouble turning off the lights, watch a haunting.  As for this show, it is pure enjoyment with some pretty scary stuff in every episode.  Chip Coffey is one of my favorite mediums on TV.  What about Elaine Warren?  You certainly can't dispute her credibility as a medium and she's been on the show several times. There will always be a level of doubt in this genre/field, so take claims of fact or fake with a grain of salt.

Not all of the film footage had been aired, but the majority has been.I actually thought that Buell & his PRS Group would not sell out to become the next ""big thing"" to hit the talk circuits, etc. etc. I WAS SO WRONG!!!!

I hope that the money you are making off all the big A&E; Conventions, and Events will help you sleep at night.Ryan it has never mattered to me what your gender preferrence has been.
