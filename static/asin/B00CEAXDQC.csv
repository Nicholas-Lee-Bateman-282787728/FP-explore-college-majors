That's how I felt after 1 hour and 15 minutes. This is the most inconclusive movie I've ever seen. If you are willing to sacrifice time to watch a movie with no ending, go ahead.",2,What happened here?,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,320,"['Just', 'imagine', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'suspense', 'almost', 'end', 'movie', 'power', 'out', 'never', 'finish', 'how', 'felt', '1', 'hour', '15', 'minutes', 'most', 'inconclusive', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'ending', 'go', 'ahead']",The Expelled
1646139,AWKRTLXGSNRES,B00CEAXDQC,"Donald C. Hagy ""DHagy &#34;movie goer&#34;""","[5, 6]","I don't believe I have ever seen such a disjointed effort of a movie.  It begins innocently enough, with a father teaching an English class (also attended by his daughter).  He begins passing out previous test papers...accompanied by his caustic comments.  One young man takes exception about the remarks intended for him and punches the teacher in the face.  Forward to a school board hearing wherein the teacher realizes he is going to be railroaded and he storms out of the meeting.The next scene is teacher looking like he's been rode hard and put up wet.  He's now a boozing, unclean, unshaven mess (who still teaches), but for some unexplained reasoning his daughter now despises him and he has no control of his classroom.  He finds out his daughter has chosen to accompany her boyfriend to a concert on her birthday instead of staying with daddy.  There is some sort of confrontation during class and father sends disrespectful daughter to detention.  I had no idea detention (in Britain) lasted until 8:30 p.m.  This is when the ""fun"" starts.For whatever reason, the people inside the school--and they are NOT LOCKED IN as the advertisement would have you believe--find themselves suddenly terrorized by some people wearing hoodies.  These goons are very good at bashing in skulls and faces with fire extinguishers and doing messy things with crowbars.  Why?  You never find out.  Who are they?  You never find out.  There is no backstory to anything.  I would have at least liked to have known why dad became a complete basket case and why the security guards at this particular school did not have opposable thumbs.  Too bad for me, huh?""The Expelled"" at one time must have SEEMED like a good idea to someone.  But all the viewer is innundated with are scenes of the bad guys dashing in the background behind their intended victims wreaking havoc.  No explanation is given for ANYTHING.  The viewer is asked to sit and watch (albeit for only 74 minutes) something that barely passes as a movie...and then it just ends.I have seen very few movies that I would list as ""hating"" (as Amazon wants you to do).  However, I have seen MANY movies that are not as good as some community theater productions I've gone to.  Such is the case for ""The Expelled.""  The movie is rated ""R"" for language and violence.  I do not recommend wasting your time watching this completely disjointed attempt at a movie.",2,The Expectorant,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,2405,"['do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'disjointed', 'effort', 'movie', 'innocently', 'enough', 'father', 'teaching', 'English', 'class', 'also', 'attended', 'daughter', 'passing', 'out', 'previous', 'test', 'papers', 'accompanied', 'caustic', 'comments', 'One', 'young', 'man', 'exception', 'remarks', 'intended', 'teacher', 'face', 'Forward', 'school', 'board', 'hearing', 'teacher', 'going', 'be', 'railroaded', 'meeting.The', 'next', 'scene', 'teacher', 'looking', 'been', 'rode', 'hard', 'put', 'up', 'wet', 'now', 'boozing', 'unclean', 'unshaven', 'mess', 'who', 'still', 'unexplained', 'reasoning', 'daughter', 'now', 'control', 'classroom', 'out', 'daughter', 'chosen', 'accompany', 'boyfriend', 'concert', 'birthday', 'instead', 'staying', 'daddy', 'sort', 'confrontation', 'class', 'father', 'sends', 'disrespectful', 'daughter', 'detention', 'had', 'idea', 'detention', 'Britain', 'lasted', '8:30', 'p.m', 'when', 'fun', 'starts.For', 'reason', 'people', 'school', 'are', 'NOT', 'LOCKED', 'IN', 'advertisement', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'find', 'suddenly', 'terrorized', 'people', 'wearing', 'hoodies', 'goons', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'bashing', 'skulls', 'fire', 'extinguishers', 'doing', 'messy', 'things', 'crowbars', 'Why', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'Who', 'are', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'backstory', 'anything', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'liked', 'have', 'known', 'why', 'dad', 'became', 'complete', 'basket', 'case', 'why', 'security', 'guards', 'particular', 'school', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'opposable', 'thumbs', 'Too', 'bad', 'huh', 'Expelled', 'one', 'time', 'must', 'have', 'SEEMED', 'good', 'idea', 'someone', 'viewer', 'innundated', 'are', 'scenes', 'bad', 'guys', 'dashing', 'background', 'intended', 'victims', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'explanation', 'given', 'ANYTHING', 'viewer', 'asked', 'sit', 'watch', 'albeit', 'only', '74', 'minutes', 'something', 'barely', 'movie', 'then', 'just', 'ends.I', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'would', 'list', 'hating', 'Amazon', 'do', 'However', 'have', 'seen', 'MANY', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'community', 'theater', 'productions', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'Such', 'case', 'Expelled', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'language', 'violence', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'wasting', 'time', 'watching', 'completely', 'disjointed', 'attempt', 'movie']",The Expelled
1646140,A1EGZYG8PC51U5,B00CEAXDQC,"D. Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[3, 5]","What a rarity it is to find a new horror release that's produced such apathy that it can't even muster a customer review on Amazon... until now(cue the foreboding music).  Granted, the title ""Expelled"" and accompanying cover shot are both pretty bland(then again, there were two newer horror releases nearby, both under the EXACT same title of ""Home Sweet Home,"" so maybe this isn't all that uninspiring...), however it does feature some positive quotes from actual respectable sources(although, ""one of the all time best slasher films,"" this is not)rather than, ""I couldn't sleep for a week!""- Some Random Dude.  The movie starts with our main protagonist Robert(an outstanding David Schofield) being assaulted by a student while teaching.  Flash forward a year and he has allowed the incident to basically ruin his life.  Turning him into a shell of his former self, while costing him all professional respect he once had, as well as his family. While holding his own daughter after class for detention(awkward much?) a group of shadowy hooded figures begin a silent and brutal assault on the school and all those unlucky enough to still reside within.  They creep and crawl on top of lockers and bookshelves, silently cornering their prey when they feel the time is right, and showing no mercy when they do strike.  Much of the violence is implied, but when you do see the after effects it's clear that they are interested in making their victims suffer(for example, burning someone alive in a locked dumpster).  And that's basically it.  All these ingredients have been used before but director Johannes Roberts prepares a surprisingly effective concoction here that never wears out it's welcome(an air tight hour and twenty minutes).  The direction, acting, and musical score(felt underused even) are all very good!  I was so impressed in fact that I looked him up on IMDB... let's just say it appears he learned the hard way(though I do plan on giving ""Storage 24"" a look).  One major complaint that I could see some having is the open ended and ambiguous ending.  The killers are silent and faceless with no motive ever revealed.  I've always enjoyed that in my horror films... I mean, isn't it scarier when Michael Myers butchers his sister on Halloween night for no apparent reason(rather than because he grew up in a broken home with a stripper mom and abusive stepfather like in the Rob Zombie remake)?  But each to their own.  The Expelled is more than deserving of a viewing either way. (3.5 Stars)",3,Expelled?! But I gave it a solid B... tough grading curve I guess?

1646141,A1ZOUKFV07V8RK,B00CEAXDQC,hated and proud,"[0, 0]","And even if they did, it was on the path toward film oblivion. What in the world happened here? Okay, trying to still wrap my head around this 24 hours after viewing it, I gather that it is a film about a teacher, who gets punched by a student, and this seemingly small and insignificant event in his life has caused him to become a drunken former shell of himself incapable of pretty much anything. About a year after this life-altering five finger sandwich he is still teaching, and now his daughter hates him for some reason, make one up because it doesn't give you one. As the pathetic man he now is, the only way he can spend time with her is to give her detention. I would have offered a lunch or dinner, but to each his own. Now I guess in the U.K., they take detention very seriously because I remember being let out when it was still light outside, but here they keep you for hours. It's dark and enter our very mysterious antagonists. Well, they would be mysterious if this film even half-bothered to give some reason or plot for us to follow. So these four of five hooded figures parkour their way around the school dispatching those unlucky characters still left wandering the premises. Up to this point, I already made my mind that this movie was no good, but I was unaware of the horrendous ending, and I use that term very loosely. It is seriously like they ran out of money and just had to stop filming and was like, &#34;Here, this is what we got so far.....&#34;, and then actually released it. It left me with so many questions: What happens to the mom? Who in the heck are those parkour killers and why are they terrorizing the school? Is there a plot?? Did I leave the oven on? If a train left the station in Chicago going 60mph and I placed this movie on the tracks and it ran it over, would I feel any better? Really, really, really bad.
