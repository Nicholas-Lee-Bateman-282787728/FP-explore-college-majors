335770,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302798434,Byron Kolln,"[3, 3]","The legend of Mae West was well and truly sealed when she wrote and starred in 1933's I'M NO ANGEL.  Most fans will single out this as her greatest movie, and I wholeheartedly agree.West plays Tira, a carnival dancer/lion tamer, who makes a very profitible sub-career out of charming older men and reaping the rewards of their large fortunes.  That all changes when she meets Jack Clayton (Cary Grant), a millionaire who actually wants to marry her!I'M NO ANGEL introduced many of Mae West's classic quotes; and is filled with great sequences, including the court case where Tira is confronted by almost every man from her past!  Despite a very large supporting cast (Gregory Ratoff, Edward Arnold, Gertrude Michael, Ralf Harolde, Gertrude Howard, Libby Taylor), this is TOTALLY Mae's show, and the audience is never allowed to forget it.Cary Grant adds a lot of charm to the story; Mae West hated working with leading men who were attractive and made no secret of her dislike for Grant.  Apparently the feeling was mutual and Cary Grant refused to work with her ever again.  Following I'M NO ANGEL, the male leads in West's movies were always incidental and played by older character actors.  Despite their personal feud, the chemistry between West and Grant is palpable.I'M NO ANGEL remains a sparkling, fast-paced romantic comedy from Hollywood's pre-code days; the perfect entertainment for a lazy weekend afternoon.",4,the greatest Mae West movie,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,1420,"['legend', 'Mae', 'West', 'was', 'well', 'truly', 'sealed', 'when', 'wrote', 'starred', '1933', ""'M"", 'ANGEL', 'Most', 'fans', 'will', 'single', 'out', 'greatest', 'movie', 'wholeheartedly', 'agree.West', 'plays', 'Tira', 'carnival', 'dancer/lion', 'tamer', 'who', 'very', 'profitible', 'sub-career', 'charming', 'older', 'men', 'reaping', 'rewards', 'large', 'fortunes', 'changes', 'when', 'Jack', 'Clayton', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'millionaire', 'who', 'actually', 'marry', ""'M"", 'ANGEL', 'introduced', 'many', 'Mae', 'West', 'classic', 'quotes', 'filled', 'great', 'sequences', 'including', 'court', 'case', 'where', 'Tira', 'confronted', 'almost', 'man', 'past', 'very', 'large', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Gregory', 'Ratoff', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'Gertrude', 'Michael', 'Ralf', 'Harolde', 'Gertrude', 'Howard', 'Libby', 'Taylor', 'TOTALLY', 'Mae', 'show', 'audience', 'never', 'allowed', 'forget', 'it.Cary', 'Grant', 'lot', 'charm', 'story', 'Mae', 'West', 'hated', 'working', 'leading', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'attractive', 'made', 'secret', 'dislike', 'Grant', 'Apparently', 'feeling', 'was', 'mutual', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'refused', 'work', 'ever', 'again', 'Following', ""'M"", 'ANGEL', 'male', 'West', 'movies', 'were', 'always', 'incidental', 'played', 'older', 'character', 'actors', 'personal', 'feud', 'chemistry', 'West', 'Grant', 'palpable.I', 'NO', 'ANGEL', 'sparkling', 'fast-paced', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Hollywood', 'pre-code', 'days', 'perfect', 'entertainment', 'lazy', 'weekend', 'afternoon']",Im No Angel VHS
335771,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,6302798434,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","""I'm No Angel"", along with her first starring feature, the classic ""She Done Him Wrong"" (1933) is often considered to be one of Mae West's best features. Whether this is true or not, it does contain some of her wittiest and funniest dialogue.West plays Tira, a circus performer who hits the big time as a lion tamer. Her fame and prestige catches the eye of several male suitors. One of them is the dashing Jack Clayton (Cary Grant) who is clearly smitten and proposes marriage. Wanting to settle down with Clayton, Tira decides she wants to quit her circus act but her shady manager  and business partner, Big Bill Barton (Edward Arnold), who is making a fortune off of her show, concocts a scheme to keep her in the show but it ultimately destroys her relationship. The last quarter of the film is a hilarious court room scene which is probably one of the funniest court cases ever seen on film.Much has been said about this charming early 30's comedy. As mentioned, it contains some of West's wittiest dialogue and she delivers them fast and furious. Many of her most famous lines are featured here including ""When I'm good I'm very good but when I'm bad, I'm better"" and ""It's not the men in your life that count, it's the life in your men"". Another note-worthy piece of talk that again, showcases her incredible wit is when she is asked by her shady Manager (after Tira got herself in a bit of trouble) ""How are you mixed up in all of this?"" Tira's response: ""Like an olive in a dry martini."" The woman was a hoot however she was also her own worst enemy. West's ego stroking is at it's zenith in this film which is also my main complaint. Despite the bawdy humour and hysterical dialogue, there is too much of Mae and far too much swooning over her and her physical appeal. A bit less would have worked better especially considering that Hollywood's other more conventional bombshells, Harlow, Monroe, Welch, Hayworth etc, hardly had this many men salivating over them in one 90 minute feature. We get it, Tira, as written, is a bewitching temptress, but the audience doesn't need reminding every 5 minutes on how irresistible she is since it becomes a bit tiresome and the standard then becomes too impossibly high to meet with only a few women being able to meet or exceed it. Still, this is a funny movie that showcases the wit, wisdom and enduring personality of one of the most legendary comedienne's of the silver screen. Although I still crown ""She Done Him Wrong"" as her absolute best, this one comes mighty close in matching that brilliance. They don't make movies or stars like this any more and this comes highly recommended.You can also get this film in the DVD setMae West - The Glamour Collectionwhich includes 5 of her movies and is worth purchasing, especially if you are a fan of the legendary West.",4,"When She's Bad, She's Better",1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,2822,"[""'m"", 'Angel', 'first', 'starring', 'feature', 'classic', 'Done', 'Him', 'Wrong', '1933', 'often', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'Mae', 'West', 'best', 'features', 'true', 'not', 'contain', 'wittiest', 'funniest', 'dialogue.West', 'plays', 'Tira', 'circus', 'performer', 'who', 'big', 'time', 'lion', 'tamer', 'fame', 'prestige', 'eye', 'several', 'male', 'suitors', 'One', 'dashing', 'Jack', 'Clayton', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'who', 'clearly', 'smitten', 'marriage', 'Wanting', 'settle', 'down', 'Clayton', 'Tira', 'quit', 'circus', 'act', 'shady', 'manager', 'business', 'partner', 'Big', 'Bill', 'Barton', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'who', 'making', 'fortune', 'show', 'scheme', 'keep', 'show', 'ultimately', 'relationship', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'hilarious', 'court', 'room', 'scene', 'probably', 'one', 'funniest', 'court', 'cases', 'ever', 'seen', 'film.Much', 'been', 'said', 'charming', 'early', '30', 'comedy', 'mentioned', 'West', 'wittiest', 'dialogue', 'fast', 'furious', 'Many', 'most', 'famous', 'lines', 'are', 'featured', 'here', 'including', 'When', ""'m"", 'good', ""'m"", 'very', 'good', 'when', ""'m"", 'bad', ""'m"", 'better', 'not', 'men', 'life', 'count', 'life', 'men', 'note-worthy', 'piece', 'talk', 'again', 'incredible', 'wit', 'when', 'asked', 'shady', 'Manager', 'Tira', 'got', 'bit', 'trouble', 'How', 'are', 'mixed', 'up', 'Tira', 'response', 'olive', 'dry', 'martini', 'woman', 'was', 'hoot', 'however', 'was', 'also', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'West', 'ego', 'stroking', 'zenith', 'film', 'also', 'main', 'complaint', 'bawdy', 'humour', 'hysterical', 'dialogue', 'too', 'much', 'Mae', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'swooning', 'physical', 'appeal', 'bit', 'less', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'especially', 'considering', 'Hollywood', 'other', 'more', 'conventional', 'bombshells', 'Harlow', 'Monroe', 'Welch', 'Hayworth', 'etc', 'hardly', 'had', 'many', 'men', 'salivating', 'one', '90', 'minute', 'feature', 'get', 'Tira', 'written', 'bewitching', 'temptress', 'audience', ""n't"", 'need', 'reminding', '5', 'minutes', 'how', 'irresistible', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'standard', 'then', 'too', 'impossibly', 'high', 'meet', 'only', 'few', 'women', 'being', 'able', 'meet', 'exceed', 'Still', 'funny', 'movie', 'wit', 'wisdom', 'enduring', 'personality', 'one', 'most', 'legendary', 'comedienne', 'silver', 'screen', 'still', 'crown', 'Done', 'Him', 'Wrong', 'absolute', 'best', 'one', 'mighty', 'close', 'matching', 'brilliance', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'stars', 'more', 'highly', 'recommended.You', 'can', 'also', 'get', 'film', 'DVD', 'setMae', 'West', 'Glamour', 'Collectionwhich', '5', 'movies', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'legendary', 'West']",Im No Angel VHS

She was a small woman with a face that defied most standards of beauty and an unremarkable body--and by the time she hit film she was edging into middle age.  But as West herself might have said, it ain't what ya got, its what ya do with it. If anybody knew what to do with it, Mae West certainly did, and I'M NO ANGEL finds her doing it in remarkably fine style indeed.The story and script, by West herself, is hilariously improbable.  West stars as Tira, a carny entertainer who divides her work between a hootchie coochie act (which gives her the opportunity to perform a sizzling ""They Call Me Sister Honky Tonk"") and a lion taming act--but when she runs afoul of a small town romeo she hits the road for New York, where she captivates both city and Cary Grant with her circus act.  Needless to say, there are comic complications galore, but like the Mounties, Mae West always gets her man.West did a number of justly famous films during the 1930s, but I'M NO ANGEL is arguably her best, salted with with one memorable quip after another as she cracks whips, snubs snobs, frolicks with her maids (""Peel me a grape!""), and waylays the willing Cary Grant with considerable aplomb.

Whether she actually did, I have no trouble believing it. In &quot;I'm No Angel&quot;, Miss West plays &quot;Tira&quot;, a carnival hootch dancer who becomes a lion-taming headliner in &quot;The Big Time&quot;, and has numerous men orbiting her, like moons around Venus. She is a women completely at ease with herself, fears no one, makes no apologies, and the men love her for it, in spite of themselves. Miss West played, essentially, the same role in real life, the &quot;Bad but not Evil&quot; woman. No beating around the bush for Mae-she told you who she was, what she wanted, take her or leave her-and made you laugh!  She was &quot;Women's Lib&quot; in flashy gowns, big hats, and lots of diamonds. There are many of West's famous lines in &quot;I'm No Angel&quot;, such as &quot;When I'm good, I'm very, very good, but when I'm bad, I'm better&quot;, &quot;Beulah, peel me a grape!&quot;, and many more. Her co-star is screen legend Cary Grant, whom Mae selected for 2 of her films on sight. The first was &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot;, and then this one. She said, &quot;He was so good I had him twice-in pictures, I mean.&quot; The lady was an original. She was not &quot;beautiful&quot; or slender, but men were drawn to her (her brains being her sexiest feature), progressive (she defended homosexuals long before Stonewall), had interracial friendships and romances (she had lovers of African descent, as well as having black performers in her films), and was still attracting men well into her 70s!

Before the censorship czars got after her, that is.  Legendary Mae struts and sings her way through this tale of circus hootchie Tira who gets in a legal jam thanks to her hoodlum boyfriend. Needing fast cash for an attorney, she reluctantly agrees to be the show's lion tamer and put her head in a lion's mouth. She becomes an immediate star and rises to the top. She hooks a rich beau (Kent Taylor) but falls for his business partner Kirk (Cary Grant) and they become engaged to marry. But her old circus cronies won't let her retire and try to frame her in a scandal to break up the engagement. When the ruse works and Kirk breaks off with Tira, she takes him to court for breach of promise. &quot;I'm No Angel&quot; is all Mae. From the screenplay (which she wrote) to the gowns (which are knockouts---especially the &quot;spider web&quot; gown) she's the star and dominates every scene she's in. She's absolutely wonderful. From strutting around and singing with her maids to taking over her own case in the courtroom, you can see there was no one like her and never would be. She was totally unique and unequaled in terms of sheer star power. Some of her racy quotes are here in &quot;I'm No Angel&quot; but, alas, the better ones lie in &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot; (also with Grant) and that one never made it to DVD.

335779,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6302798434,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 3]","Mae West and Cary Grant starred in I'm No Angel, an excellent comedy from the early 1930s that shines even though the Hayes production code watered it down a little. The plot moves along at a very good clip; and West, who wrote the screenplay, gets in plenty of innuendos, double entendres and wisecracks all along the way.The action begins at a local circus where Tira (Mae West) does her nightly song and dance number to the delight of many men. What most people don't know is that Tira and her not so charming buddy Slick Wiley (Ralf Harolde) ""take a little off the top"" from men Tira romances as she and Slick steal from them. One night one of Tira's ""social encounters"" goes horribly bad when the guy she's ""romancing"" gets hit by Slick; and after Slick gets sent to jail Tira needs money fast to get herself a good lawyer to avoid jail herself.In order to get the cash she needs, Tira caves in to the demands of the circus owner: she must put her head into the jaws of a lion. (Mae West did this stunt herself!) In exchange for this stunt the circus manager gives her plenty of cash--and she gets to know a man who really likes her as he lavishes her with gifts, Kirk Lawrence (Kent Taylor).Well, Kirk's fianc&eacute;e doesn't like Tira at all after that; but it takes Kirk's friend Jack Clayton (Cary Grant) to convince Kirk to stay with his fianc&eacute;e. When Jack visits Tira in her new swanky apartment provided to her by Kirk, the romantic sparks in the plot REALLY begin to fly.Of course, what happens could surprise you. Who will Tira finally wind up with--Slick, Jack or Kirk? Will she get any man at all? Will one or more of the men try to manipulate people to their own personal advantage? No spoilers here, folks--watch the movie to find out!This film was not only written by Mae West, she warbles her way through two or three songs as well. The scenes in the lion cage reflect great choreography. The cinematography is excellent--in real life Cary Grant and Mae West detested each other so their ""love scenes"" were filmed with only one actor, one day at a time and then spliced together to make it look as if they were in the scenes together. That's pretty good for a film from 1933!Overall, this film provided Mae West with an excellent vehicle for her classic red hot mama act; and she gives an excellent performance. Although the film belongs to West, the other actors and actresses do a fine job and they also support West very well.I highly recommend this film for Mae West fans and people who enjoy fast paced comedy flicks from the early 1930s. Cary Grant fans will like I'm No Angel as well.Enjoy!",5,I'm peeling her a grape--can anybody else write this review for me now ???,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,2625,"['Mae', 'West', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'starred', ""'m"", 'Angel', 'excellent', 'comedy', 'early', '1930s', 'shines', 'even', 'Hayes', 'production', 'code', 'watered', 'down', 'little', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'clip', 'West', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'plenty', 'innuendos', 'double', 'entendres', 'wisecracks', 'way.The', 'action', 'local', 'circus', 'where', 'Tira', 'Mae', 'West', 'nightly', 'song', 'dance', 'number', 'delight', 'many', 'men', 'What', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Tira', 'not', 'so', 'charming', 'buddy', 'Slick', 'Wiley', 'Ralf', 'Harolde', 'take', 'little', 'off', 'top', 'men', 'Tira', 'romances', 'Slick', 'steal', 'One', 'night', 'one', 'Tira', 'social', 'encounters', 'horribly', 'bad', 'when', 'guy', 'romancing', 'hit', 'Slick', 'Slick', 'sent', 'jail', 'Tira', 'money', 'fast', 'get', 'good', 'lawyer', 'avoid', 'jail', 'herself.In', 'order', 'get', 'cash', 'Tira', 'demands', 'circus', 'owner', 'must', 'put', 'head', 'jaws', 'lion', 'Mae', 'West', 'did', 'stunt', 'exchange', 'stunt', 'circus', 'manager', 'plenty', 'cash', 'know', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'gifts', 'Kirk', 'Lawrence', 'Kent', 'Taylor', '.Well', 'Kirk', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'e', ""n't"", 'like', 'Tira', 'Kirk', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Clayton', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'convince', 'Kirk', 'stay', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'When', 'Jack', 'Tira', 'new', 'swanky', 'apartment', 'provided', 'Kirk', 'romantic', 'sparks', 'plot', 'REALLY', 'begin', 'fly.Of', 'course', 'what', 'could', 'surprise', 'Who', 'will', 'Tira', 'finally', 'up', 'Slick', 'Jack', 'Kirk', 'Will', 'get', 'man', 'Will', 'one', 'more', 'men', 'try', 'manipulate', 'people', 'own', 'personal', 'advantage', 'No', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'written', 'Mae', 'West', 'way', 'two', 'three', 'songs', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'lion', 'cage', 'reflect', 'great', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'real', 'life', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Mae', 'West', 'detested', 'other', 'so', 'love', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'only', 'one', 'actor', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'then', 'spliced', 'together', 'make', 'look', 'were', 'scenes', 'together', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', '1933', 'Overall', 'film', 'provided', 'Mae', 'West', 'excellent', 'vehicle', 'classic', 'red', 'hot', 'mama', 'act', 'excellent', 'performance', 'film', 'belongs', 'West', 'other', 'actors', 'actresses', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'also', 'support', 'West', 'very', 'well.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'Mae', 'West', 'fans', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'fast', 'paced', 'comedy', 'flicks', 'early', '1930s', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'fans', 'will', 'like', ""'m"", 'Angel', 'well.Enjoy']",Im No Angel VHS
335780,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,6302798434,mirasreviews,"[8, 10]","Tira (Mae West) is a gold-digging circus performer who reluctantly agrees to a dangerous lion-taming act to get herself out of a jam. The act is a great success, making Tira the talk of the town. Her flashy show at Madison Square Garden catches the eye of a wealthy businessman named Kirk Lawrence (Kent Taylor), who becomes infatuated with Tira and lavishes her with expensive gifts. Concerned for Kirk's social situation, his cousin and business partner, Jack Clayton (Cary Grant), attempts to convince Tira to reconsider their relationship. She does, and falls head over heels for Jack. But just as it looks like Jack and Tira will live happily ever after, Jack breaks off the relationship. A heartbroken but still stubborn Tira decides to sue him for breach of promise.1933's ""I'm No Angel"" was Mae West's second starring role on the silver screen. After her previous film, ""She Done Him Wrong"", saved Paramount Pictures from financial ruin, the studio gave her carte blanche to do whatever she liked on this one. ""I'm No Angel"" was written entirely by Mae West. It's a romantic comedy, but West's character is not a romantic. Tira is nothing if not practical in her relationships with men. And there is no mistaking that the film exists entirely to showcase Ms. West's oversized personality and eye-catching figure. This is Self promotion and Star vehicle with capital S's. Mae West was 40 years old and a tad chunky when she made this film. But she didn't hesitate to cast herself as a sex goddess whom men of all ages found irresistible. And she gets away with it by sheer force of personality. West deserves a lot of credit for making audiences root for a union between a trash-talking middle-aged strumpet and a 29-year old gentleman of means. Such a relationship wouldn't gain approval in real life in 1933, and it wouldn't now. The success of ""I'm No Angel"", then and now, is testament to its star's great charisma. Cary Grant is more handsome than he would be during his years of star status, and surprisingly thinner. I don't think any actor could hope to share a scene with West without being upstaged by her, but Grant does a nice job of making Jack Clayton sympathetic, especially during the trial scenes. ""I'm No Angel"" is sometimes absurdly contrived, but that's the nature of romantic comedy. No bigger personality than Mae West ever graced the screen, and it's her presence that makes this film worthwhile. The DVD has no menu, only scene selections.

One day, a special man rolls along (Cary Grant) and she wants to become a one man woman. This does not happen, though, until about halfway through the film.Perhaps the code helped West more than it hurt her. When it was put into effect, she had to censor herself more, forcing her to limit the amount of inuendo used and to create a solid storyline.

335787,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302798434,Simon Davis,"[5, 5]","Mae West was one of Hollywwod's more unusual creations and in the early 30's she created quite a stir with her type of humour that was laced with a strong sexual slant that delighted audiences but raised the scorn of the censors.Writing most of her own material she created some gems that still amuse and titilate viewers of her films. Her classic films ""She Done Him Wrong"" and ""I'm No Angel"" were luckily free from the Hays office censorship laws that whitewashed much of the humour from the mid 30's onwards resulting  in her later vechicles being much milder and indeed weaker showcases for her humour. Here we see Mae West in her prime in a story designed around her unique talents which gave full rein to her sexual brand of humour.Mae plays Tira, a carnival performer who ends up being blackmailed by a former lover ""I'm No Angel"" benefited from  having a lavish budget provided which is even a step up from that of ""She Done Him Wrong"". While the overraul humour is not as fresh as it is in ""She Done""  it nevertheless contains some of Mae's more memorable lines like ""When I'm good I'm good but when I'm bad I'm better"" and in response to Rajah the fortune tellers prediction from his crystal ball that Tira will have a man in her life, her response is ""What only one!!"". Hilarious stuff and as always it is delivered by Mae in that unique style of hers which always seems to make you feel that underneath the sexual tiger was a nice woman who at the end of the day is a decent type.Once again Mae is supported by Cary Grant in one of his earliest roles and once again I feel he comes across as quite wooden, nowhere near being the wonderful charmer he was to become in his later career as a Hollywood great. He lends able support in the romance stacks but no more. Edward Arnold as Big Bill Barton also has an effective role as the manager of Tira's carnival. As in ""She Done Him Wrong"" Mae has some very funny sequences with her black maids and in this film she at one stage actually has 5 of them !! Gertrude Howard is the main one and her delivery of snappy dialogue opposite Mae is a total delight and will keep you laughing. Also watch out for Hattie McDaniel as another of the maids in what is one of her very earliest screen appearances.""I'm No Angel"" has many memorable scenes including the priceless courtroom scene near the end when Mae, in indomitable style, turns the tables on her accusers, her seduction of Cary Grant in the memorable Rhinestone Spider Web gown (what a creation it is!!) and the much commented on carnival sequences when Mae gets to play Lion tamer and puts her head in the lions mouth!!!As in all West films more is implied than actually ever done which gives the work an ageless quality and keeps her humour as amusing and fresh today as it was in 1933. When you think of how sex is thrown in our faces constantly in modern films this type of approach is far more effective. As Mae herself was quoted as saying ""What the audience goes away thinking is far more important than what they actually see"" So true!!
