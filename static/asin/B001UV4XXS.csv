I've watched this movie several times, and each time I watch it, there is something new and funny that I notice.CWACOM is about an aspiring inventor, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), and his attempts to live up to the legacies of the greatest inventors in history. Flint is a grown-up child whose eccentric behavior is only bested by his enthusiasm to create the greatest invention mankind has ever known.So far, his inventions have only been notorious for ending in disaster -- either personally (the spray-on shoes he applied in class, only to find out they would not come off), or for the entire town (the ratbirds that escaped and bred at an alarming rate).His pursuit of this legacy is stymied by Earl Deveraux (Mr. T), a local cop who has his eye on Flint, and is half-superhero; and his Father, Tim (James Caan), a Sardine Bait & Tackle shop owner who is losing faith in his son's ability to invent anything meaningful, and wants him to work in the tackle shop. Tim is a very strong character, one of the funniest, and he does it without trying (he delivers some of the funniest ""lines"" in the movie without uttering a word.)For his latest invention, Flint is working on the ""Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator,"" or FLDSMDFR for short (pronounced FLI-dis-m'duh-fur). Once the FLDSMDFR works, water will go in the top, and the food of your choice will come out at the bottom. Flint just needs a little more power, and the town will no longer be stuck eating the sardines that the world recently declared to be ""super gross.""Cloudy does not have a single dull moment. If you blink, you might miss one of the most hilarous parts of the movie, but there are so many of those instances that it's hard to say when that would be. It's chock-full of sight gags, wacky sound effects, stupidly great jokes & puns, and Flint Lockwood's nerdy attempts to impress weathergirl Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) with his intelligence, humor, or his claim to have an allergy in common with her.The animation can only be described as Ren & Stimpy meets Warner Brothers, meets Muppets. You also have the hilarious Looney Tunes-esque sound effects, intentionally ""lame"" humor, ironic use of disaster movie cliche's (weather anchor Patrick (Al Roker) even observes that the storm is ""following an unusual pattern of hitting all of the worlds major landmarks first, and then spreading across the rest of the globe,"") and an awesome soundtrack by Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh to give it the 80's retro-futuristic tone. It has become one of my favorite movies of all time.

It references various movies and advertisements from the last 40 or so years which keep you spotting things, is slyly humourous, and is wonderfully animated. My 6 and 7 year girls loved it, and so did I. Fact everyone does that I know. It has messages about everything, from bullying, to wasting food, to envirconmental issues - but all told with such good humour that they make you laugh too.Story of a young mad inventor (he invented spray on shoes, you just can't get them off again) and a ex-nerd weather reporter) and small island whose sole industry is sardine fishing and canning, until the world realises that actually sardines are really yucky.He invents a machine that can turn water into food - while subversively hooking the machine up to the towns power generator he inadvertently rockets it into the sky where it causes a cheeseburger storm. He realises that he can harness the energy by beaming messages to it via sattelite - now the town gets all its food rained down on it - and all the waste is scooped up and thrown into a town dump concealed behind a damn on the outskirts of town where they don't have to see it.Of course things go wrong, there is a mad mayor, and everyone wanting their choice of food raining down and as the machine goes out of control it is up to an intrepid group to fly into the sky in a modified car (the difference between this flying car and the one he tried to make before, is this one has wings!) But the machine has got a life of its own (queue 2001 a space odyssey) and it looks like teh Death star (star wars). Even the food has gone bad - that is, the food which has been created tries to attack them - the attack of the roasted chickens was both wildly funny and mildly disquieting.However, all works out ok in the end.There are so many bits and pieces in this movie that add colour and perspective to it and pad it out into a truly great movie. The inventors best buddy is a Monkey called Steve and he has a thought analyser which expresses what he is thinking. Usually the words ""Steve"" or ""Lick""  or something equally banal. The town's previous star was 'baby Brent' who appeared on all the packs of Sardines in a coppertone style add. Now a grossly overweight man with a mullet haircut, he still strips off wearing a nappy for openings etc - only his body fat judders when he does.I really loved the small animations which made the characters so expressive. The father doesn't really change expression - yet the animators have relied on really tiny alterations of body language to show what he is thinking. Quite wonderfully done.I could go on about the cleverness, the colour, the texture of this, the rapid dialogue both at the forefront and in the background. But take my word for it, this movie is GREAT - and you will enjoy it immensely. i am off to buy the book next.",5,"Smart, funny, movie the Whole family will love.",1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,2914,"['hilarious', 'story', 'told', 'several', 'levels', 'appealing', 'whole', 'family', 'various', 'movies', 'advertisements', 'last', '40', 'so', 'years', 'keep', 'spotting', 'things', 'slyly', 'humourous', 'wonderfully', 'animated', '6', '7', 'year', 'girls', 'loved', 'so', 'did', 'Fact', 'everyone', 'know', 'messages', 'everything', 'bullying', 'wasting', 'food', 'envirconmental', 'issues', 'told', 'such', 'good', 'humour', 'make', 'too.Story', 'young', 'mad', 'inventor', 'invented', 'spray', 'shoes', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'again', 'ex-nerd', 'weather', 'reporter', 'small', 'island', 'sole', 'industry', 'sardine', 'fishing', 'canning', 'world', 'actually', 'sardines', 'are', 'really', 'yucky.He', 'invents', 'machine', 'can', 'turn', 'water', 'food', 'subversively', 'hooking', 'machine', 'up', 'towns', 'power', 'generator', 'inadvertently', 'sky', 'where', 'cheeseburger', 'storm', 'can', 'harness', 'energy', 'beaming', 'messages', 'sattelite', 'now', 'town', 'food', 'rained', 'down', 'waste', 'scooped', 'up', 'thrown', 'town', 'dump', 'concealed', 'damn', 'outskirts', 'town', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'it.Of', 'course', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'mad', 'mayor', 'everyone', 'wanting', 'choice', 'food', 'raining', 'down', 'machine', 'control', 'up', 'intrepid', 'group', 'fly', 'sky', 'modified', 'car', 'difference', 'flying', 'car', 'one', 'tried', 'make', 'one', 'wings', 'machine', 'got', 'life', 'own', 'queue', '2001', 'space', 'odyssey', 'teh', 'Death', 'star', 'star', 'wars', 'Even', 'food', 'gone', 'bad', 'food', 'been', 'created', 'tries', 'attack', 'attack', 'roasted', 'chickens', 'was', 'wildly', 'funny', 'mildly', 'disquieting.However', 'out', 'ok', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'bits', 'pieces', 'movie', 'colour', 'perspective', 'pad', 'out', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'inventors', 'best', 'buddy', 'Monkey', 'called', 'Steve', 'thought', 'analyser', 'what', 'thinking', 'Usually', 'words', 'Steve', 'Lick', 'something', 'equally', 'banal', 'town', 'previous', 'star', 'was', 'Brent', 'who', 'appeared', 'packs', 'Sardines', 'coppertone', 'style', 'add', 'Now', 'grossly', 'overweight', 'man', 'mullet', 'haircut', 'still', 'wearing', 'nappy', 'openings', 'etc', 'only', 'body', 'fat', 'judders', 'when', 'really', 'loved', 'small', 'animations', 'made', 'characters', 'so', 'expressive', 'father', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'expression', 'yet', 'animators', 'have', 'relied', 'really', 'tiny', 'alterations', 'body', 'language', 'show', 'what', 'thinking', 'Quite', 'wonderfully', 'done.I', 'could', 'go', 'cleverness', 'colour', 'texture', 'rapid', 'dialogue', 'forefront', 'background', 'take', 'word', 'movie', 'GREAT', 'will', 'enjoy', 'immensely', 'i', 'am', 'buy', 'book', 'next']",N/A

Well, there just aren't that many movies out there in 3D Blu-ray, and many of them are very expensive yet.'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' is at present one of the least expensive available -- and it's a lot of fun.  I'd seen it before in regular 2D and thought it was funny, but really in many respects it's just another animated 'message' film (""Gluttony is bad.  Being your true self is good.""), somewhat formulaic and all that.  They did put in some humorous pop culture references, and a few jokes only the older folks will get.But really, if you want to show a visiting guest ""why both with 3D?"" -- put in this disc and blow their socks off.  The colors are sharp, the depth of field excellent, and there's enough 3D-specific action and features to really show off what a good 3D television system can do.I should add there are a couple bonus features on there, sample scenes from Open Season and Monster House.

It's really hard to keep up with everything taking place on screen.From what I've gathered though, this is the type of film that should almost certainly be an instant highlight with the kids, and even adults will probably find a good amount of humor in it (much like adults used to love Earthworm Jim back in the mid 90's- it's so silly that EVERYONE finds it insanely funny).The storyline is very simple- a man wants to change the weather so it rains food instead of rain.  He's apparently some kind of nerdy scientist, and he immediately connects with a female weather forecaster.  His main goal is to win over his fathers respect.It's just *extremely* fun watching an animated film where food rains down from the sky in really colorful, creative and thoughtfully designed ways.

1242250,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001UV4XXS,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 2]","Based on Judi Barrett's 1978 children's book of the same name, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS hits the right spot for kids and adults alike. It is whimsical almost to the point of such old cartoons as The Road Runner and Popeye. Which I found to be a refreshing break from the more in-your-face animated features that try to stuff political/social commentary down our gullets (see WALL-E and HAPPY FEET as two that did this to an extreme degree). Now I'm not saying that we shouldn't try and educate little Johnny and Jane, but we should, sometimes, give their minds a break and allow them a moment of sheer entertainment. And CWaCoMB does that.Take one part kid scientist-wannabe and add to the mix an intelligent weather forecaster and a father who wants his son to join the family business, and you get spaghetti tornadoes, cheeseburger hailstorms, and Jello castles. Yep. That's the type of whimsy I'm talking about.Bill Hader (Tropic Thunder) stars as the voice for Flint Lockwood, the crazy kid scientist who's creations seem to go wrong more often than not. But his one creation, a machine that mutates water into food, is a resounding success. That is, until something goes terribly wrong. But before it does, Flint meets up with sexy newscaster Sam Sparks (Anna Faris,My Super Ex-Girlfriend), who caught a break and is on the scene in Flint's sardine stricken town when his new machine launches itself into the stratosphere and starts making it rain food. Sam is very excited by this astronomical development. But on Flint's other side is his father, Tim (James Caan), who only wants his son to stop these ridiculous experiments and get into the family bait and tackle business.As Flint's machine begins raining down watermelons instead of water, the people of Flint's town become enamored with their new whiz kid and the world's interest in their little corner of the globe. This includes town Mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell,Spider-Man 3) who's gluttonous nature (in both food and fame) lead not just their own town, but nearly the entire planet, into ruin. Flint's machine goes into overload mode when too much is asked of it and, in fact, it begins to resemble features we've seen in various science fiction films. Remember the egg layer inAliens? Make sure you look at the machine whenever Flint and his crew catch up to it toward the end of the film. And sentient food that plans to destroy its maker? Foodinator! (Ahem... I meanTerminator). And remember the firstStar Trek  Motion Picturewith V-GER? How the Enterprise had to go through layers of V-GER's outer ""ship"" in order to reach its core? Keep an eye out for those similarities, too.So the film has a few extra bangs for fans that pay attention. But even if you don't, it'll still be very entertaining.

I was not aware of the book, which the publisher says is suited for the 4-8 year old crowd (which may explain why the story had not appeared on my radar) and watched the movie with no preconceived notions.The story tells us of a nerdy boy inventor named Flint who has dreams that he may someday make a difference; it just seems that his efforts to realize those dreams always meet with limited or no success. As the story unfolds we see the dreams taking on bigger dimensions until one day when something goes seriously wrong.Living on an island ""under the A in Atlantic"" the boy and his community are dependent on sardines for their livelihood; when people discover sardines don't taste good the bottom falls out of the sardine market and their island is in big trouble. Under the leadership of their mayor, plans are made to create a new industry for the island.The day for the big unveiling of the new project comes but is interrupted by one of Flint's experiments that changes everything; from that point on the challenge becomes what to do with the experiment in progress.The movie is entertaining and will be appreciated by the 4-8 year old child, just as the publisher said; it will probably also be appreciated by those who can let their imaginations soar. My impression is, the younger you are the more you will like the movie, at least down to 4. Being decades older than that, I can say the movie was entertaining but I'll probably not ever watch it again.If you have children or if your inner child is alive and well it should be worth at least one viewing.

I read my daughter the book it was based on the night before we went, and nothing was out of place (except for the era), it was just a different perspective. I consider this a genuine nerd flick, not because it's nerdy, but because it portrays nerds with all their shortfalls in a positive light.I love all of the retro technology references that only someone old enough could appreciate. These references just completely pass by someone who didn't recognize them and not seem out of place.I stuck around for part of the credits, I KNEW that was Mr. T's voice I heard, and I just had to confirm it. Indeed it was Mr. T in all of his glory, he made a great cop./Just an addition beyond the original review. This movies now at the $1.50 theater near me. I watched it again, and I think I actually enjoyed it more by watching it again.I can't emphasize enough how much this movie portrays the main character Flint Lockwood as a genuine realistic geek/nerd/dork, the whole 9 yard, but they actually portray it positively. Usually those types are secondary characters in movies and often a source of comic relief, and considering the nature of the movie everyone is comic relief, but it's still positive. This just makes my day.//Here's an even later edit, I added another 1/2 star now that I've bought it on DVD. The more I watch this the more I like it. I watched it with some guys from work - all over the age of 30, some in their 40's and 50's, we all laughed and everybody loved it. I work at at NASA so the people I watched it with qualified as technical people, many as full blown geeks.The humor was very intelligent - only Kevin Smith rivals this movies ability to make proper use of a running gags.The use of animal humor was awesome - you could tell what the rat-birds had to say even though they didn't speak.This fits on the shelf between Monty Python and Kevin Smith where adults are concerned, and next to Shrek where kids are concerned.",5,I really enjoyed this movie,1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,2033,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'walking', 'liked', 'read', 'daughter', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'night', 'went', 'nothing', 'was', 'place', 'era', 'was', 'just', 'different', 'perspective', 'consider', 'genuine', 'nerd', 'flick', 'not', 'nerdy', 'nerds', 'shortfalls', 'positive', 'light.I', 'retro', 'technology', 'references', 'only', 'someone', 'old', 'enough', 'could', 'appreciate', 'references', 'just', 'completely', 'pass', 'someone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'not', 'seem', 'place.I', 'stuck', 'part', 'credits', 'KNEW', 'was', 'Mr.', 'T', 'voice', 'heard', 'just', 'had', 'confirm', 'Indeed', 'was', 'Mr.', 'T', 'glory', 'made', 'great', 'cop./Just', 'addition', 'original', 'review', 'movies', 'now', '1.50', 'theater', 'watched', 'again', 'think', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'watching', 'ca', ""n't"", 'emphasize', 'enough', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'Flint', 'Lockwood', 'genuine', 'realistic', 'geek/nerd/dork', 'whole', '9', 'yard', 'actually', 'portray', 'positively', 'Usually', 'types', 'are', 'secondary', 'characters', 'movies', 'often', 'source', 'comic', 'relief', 'considering', 'nature', 'movie', 'everyone', 'comic', 'relief', 'still', 'positive', 'just', 'even', 'later', 'edit', 'added', '1/2', 'star', 'now', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'DVD', 'more', 'watch', 'more', 'watched', 'guys', 'work', 'age', '30', '40', '50', 'laughed', 'everybody', 'loved', 'work', 'NASA', 'people', 'watched', 'qualified', 'technical', 'people', 'many', 'full', 'geeks.The', 'humor', 'was', 'very', 'intelligent', 'only', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'movies', 'ability', 'make', 'proper', 'use', 'running', 'gags.The', 'use', 'animal', 'humor', 'was', 'awesome', 'could', 'tell', 'what', 'rat-birds', 'had', 'say', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak.This', 'fits', 'shelf', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'where', 'adults', 'are', 'concerned', 'next', 'Shrek', 'where', 'kids', 'are', 'concerned']",N/A

A lot of humor (safe for children) and for the most part, a fantastic family film that both children and adults will enjoy.This is possibly the best animated film not made by Disney/Pixar and if anything, Sony Pictures Animation did a wonderful job and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what film they will be animating next because what they did for ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" looks magnificent.Overall, this is a solid Blu-ray release that is just worth having in your collection and a release that is great for the entire family.  Highly recommended!NOTE: It was announced by Sony during CES that in conjunction with the release of their 3D hardware, they will be releasing ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" in 3D Blu-ray later in 2010.",4,Blu-ray: Enjoyable animated film - Note: A 3D version on Blu-ray is coming out later this year,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,7337,"['2009', 'animated', 'film', 'Cloudy', 'Chance',

For years, Flint's inventions  had  been total disasters, but one day,  Flint finally invents a  real  winner  --  a device that turns rain from  the  clouds into food.  Since  the townspeople are stuck eating only sardines,  they're thrilled  by the sudden  variety of food to choose from.  However,  growing demands for more food start overloading the system  and so,  what started  out  as a great  invention  quickly turns to  disaster, too.There's an environmental message in here about our  out-of-sight-out-of-mind  mentality about disposing waste, but it's not  played as  heavy-handedly  as Wall-E.There are 3 other messages here as well, which are:1 -- it's unfulfilling when you try to meet your needs through shallow substitutes2 -- it's important to be your authentic self (this lesson isn't just for Flint, but also for the newscaster who pretends to be dumb when she's not)3 -- you shouldn't get addicted to fame because fame is fickle (and again, this lesson isn't just for Flint, who's just now experiencing fame for the first time, but also for an aging child star who's just now having it taken away)Kids will surely delight  seeing how food is transformed in this movie... from  rooftops made out of ice cream scoops  to  a tornado made out of spaghetti and meatballs.  The movie has it's funny moments,  too, like Flint's  ice cream snowball fight with unsuspecting victims and the lame chant kids came up with to taunt the newscaster.The acting can be a little over dramatic at times, but perhaps little kids will like that.  There's also gross out humor like the dad kissing the son who just vomited and the monkey pulling out the heart of a gummi bear.  Depending on a child's humor, they'll either laugh at this or be grossed out.Towards the end, we get a kind of Indiana Jones sequence  that, on one hand, is clever in it's use of food, but on the  other  hand,  drags  a bit too long.Overall, I thought this movie was funny and clever  with a great ending showing how appearances can sometimes be deceiving.",4,Bigger isn't always better,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,2152,"['Bigger', ""n't"", 'always', 'better', 'lesson', 'inventor', 'Flint', 'Lockwood', 'rest', 'town', 'learn', 'hard', 'way', 'years', 'Flint', 'inventions', 'had', 'been', 'total', 'disasters', 'one', 'day', 'Flint', 'finally', 'real', 'winner', 'device', 'rain', 'clouds', 'food', 'townspeople', 'are', 'stuck', 'eating', 'only', 'sardines', ""'re"", 'thrilled', 'sudden', 'variety', 'food', 'choose', 'However', 'growing', 'demands', 'more', 'food', 'start', 'overloading', 'system', 'so', 'what', 'started', 'out', 'great', 'invention', 'quickly', 'disaster', 'environmental', 'message', 'here', 'out-of-sight-out-of-mind', 'mentality', 'disposing', 'waste', 'not', 'played', 'as', 'heavy-handedly', 'Wall-E.There', 'are', '3', 'other', 'messages', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'are:1', 'unfulfilling', 'when', 'try', 'meet', 'needs', 'shallow', 'substitutes2', 'important', 'be', 'authentic', 'self', 'lesson', ""n't"", 'just', 'Flint', 'also', 'newscaster', 'who', 'be', 'dumb', 'when', 'not', '3', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'addicted', 'fame', 'fame', 'fickle', 'again', 'lesson', ""n't"", 'just', 'Flint', 'who', 'just', 'now', 'experiencing', 'fame', 'first', 'time', 'also', 'aging', 'child', 'star', 'who', 'just', 'now', 'having', 'taken', 'away', 'Kids', 'will', 'surely', 'delight', 'seeing', 'how', 'food', 'transformed', 'movie', 'rooftops', 'made', 'ice', 'cream', 'tornado', 'made', 'spaghetti', 'meatballs', 'movie', 'funny', 'moments', 'too', 'Flint', 'ice', 'cream', 'snowball', 'fight', 'unsuspecting', 'victims', 'lame', 'chant', 'kids', 'came', 'up', 'taunt', 'newscaster.The', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'dramatic', 'times', 'perhaps', 'little', 'kids', 'will', 'like', 'also', 'gross', 'out', 'humor', 'dad', 'kissing', 'son', 'who', 'just', 'vomited', 'monkey', 'pulling', 'out', 'heart', 'gummi', 'bear', 'Depending', 'child', 'humor', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'be', 'grossed', 'end', 'get', 'kind', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'sequence', 'one', 'hand', 'clever', 'use', 'food', 'other', 'hand', 'bit', 'too', 'long.Overall', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'clever', 'great', 'ending', 'showing', 'how', 'appearances', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'deceiving']",N/A

1242295,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B001UV4XXS,Eric S. Kim,"[2, 9]","Ever since it was released back in 1978, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs has become a popular children's book. It's not only filled with beautiful artwork, but it also showcases some clever ways on how food of gigantic sizes can be dangerous. I remember reading the book repeatedly when I was a little kid, and I always found myself enjoying it. Judi and Ron Barrett have done a wonderful job with this one. Cut to thirty-one years later, and we have a film adaptation. Now, the small kids of today will no doubt admire it for what it is: a fast-paced, ADD-induced animated film filled with food and comedy. Unfortunately, however, those who have actually read the book when they were very young will probably find a part of their childhood obliterated. Sony Pictures has demoted the spirit of the children's book, and has made a horrible adaptation. It is more of a colossal dissatisfaction at least for me, because it could have been done properly. Now, I have to admit I might sound biased towards the film, considering that the original children's book played a part in my childhood. But the book had such a huge impact on me when I was a little kid that I simply cannot find the film enjoyable.So what's wrong with this animated film? Well, there are four major problems with CWACOM. The first problem can be quite obvious: the horrid look of the film. In the original book, there is a sort of mysticism that surrounded the artwork, and it gave the actual story some capriciousness and charm. In the movie, it's all quirkiness and NO charm. There is nothing ethereal about the foods that fall from the sky. Nothing is visually stimulating. In fact, it seems like it's all just an excuse to showcase some of the same tedious CGI animation that we've seen many times before (only this one is slightly more mediocre). The second problem with CWACOM is the pacing. Now, the flow of the film is fine during the first half, but the second half is just torture. It's so fast and so ADD-inducing that it's almost tiresome. Kids with ADD would enjoy this; I'm not so sure about everyone else. Third, the characters are.....well.....uninteresting. They don't have any real personas: they lack charisma, wit, and most of all, uniqueness. But what's worst about these characters is that it's very hard to look at them. I don't know who designed these fictional individuals, but they certainly made them look grotesque and uncanny (especially Flint and Samantha). I know it's supposed to be a family film, but the characters look WAY too cartoonish for their own good. But I think the biggest problem with CWACOM is that it's really overproduced. I think you'll notice right away that many scenes involving food are bloated with wall-to-wall action sequences and non-stop comedic segments. There is so much going on, especially in the third act of the film, that it can give you a very nauseous feeling if you're not accustomed to watching giant-sized cheeseburgers and spaghetti flying everywhere, or pancakes and sandwiches destroying everything they land on.To be honest, out of all the bad things to have come out of this, it's not really one of the worst animated films of all time. There were a few jokes that did make me laugh, and I did like the music by Mark Mothersbaugh. Unfortunately, it's still an animated atrocity. The basic premise of the children's book remains (food falling from the sky, etc.), but everything else does not. The animation is unpleasant to look at, the characters are unlikable, and all the food and the destruction are just too much to handle. Again, kids will probably love this one, but everyone else might be disappointed. I am. I did not have a fun time watching this movie. Compared to the book, it's a big letdown. The opportunity to create a great adaptation has been wasted.Grade: D",2,The Book > The Film,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,3820,"['Ever', 'was', 'released', 'back', '1978', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'become', 'popular', 'children', 'book', 'not', 'only', 'filled', 'beautiful', 'artwork', 'also', 'clever', 'ways', 'how', 'food', 'gigantic', 'sizes', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'remember', 'reading', 'book', 'repeatedly', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'always', 'found', 'enjoying', 'Judi', 'Ron', 'Barrett', 'have', 'done', 'wonderful', 'job', 'one', 'Cut', 'thirty-one', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Now', 'small', 'kids', 'today', 'will', 'doubt', 'admire', 'what', 'fast-paced', 'ADD-induced', 'animated', 'film', 'filled', 'food', 'comedy', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'who', 'have', 'actually', 'read', 'book', 'when', 'were', 'very', 'young', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'part', 'childhood', 'obliterated', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'demoted', 'spirit', 'children', 'book', 'made', 'horrible', 'adaptation', 'more', 'colossal', 'dissatisfaction', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'properly', 'Now', 'have', 'admit', 'might', 'sound', 'biased', 'towards', 'film', 'considering', 'original', 'children', 'book', 'played', 'part', 'childhood', 'book', 'had', 'huge', 'impact', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'film', 'enjoyable.So', 'what', 'wrong', 'animated', 'film', 'Well', 'are', 'four', 'major', 'problems', 'CWACOM', 'first', 'problem', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'obvious', 'horrid', 'look', 'film', 'original', 'book', 'sort', 'mysticism', 'surrounded', 'artwork', 'gave', 'actual', 'story', 'capriciousness', 'charm', 'movie', 'quirkiness', 'charm', 'nothing', 'ethereal', 'foods', 'fall', 'sky', 'Nothing', 'visually', 'stimulating', 'fact', 'just', 'excuse', 'showcase', 'same', 'tedious', 'CGI', 'animation', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'only', 'one', 'slightly', 'more', 'mediocre', 'second', 'problem', 'CWACOM', 'pacing', 'Now', 'flow', 'film', 'fine', 'first', 'half', 'second', 'half', 'just', 'torture', 'so', 'fast', 'so', 'ADD-inducing', 'almost', 'tiresome', 'Kids', 'ADD', 'would', 'enjoy', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'everyone', 'else', 'Third', 'characters', 'are', '..well', '..uninteresting', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'personas', 'lack', 'charisma', 'wit', 'most', 'uniqueness', 'what', 'worst', 'characters', 'very', 'hard', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'designed', 'fictional', 'individuals', 'certainly', 'made', 'look', 'grotesque', 'uncanny', 'especially', 'Flint', 'Samantha', 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'family', 'film', 'characters', 'look', 'WAY', 'too', 'cartoonish', 'own', 'good', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'CWACOM', 'really', 'overproduced', 'think', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'right', 'away', 'many', 'scenes', 'involving', 'food', 'are', 'bloated', 'wall-to-wall', 'action', 'sequences', 'non-stop', 'comedic', 'segments', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'especially', 'third', 'act', 'film', 'can', 'give', 'very', 'nauseous', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'not', 'accustomed', 'watching', 'giant-sized', 'cheeseburgers', 'spaghetti', 'flying', 'everywhere', 'pancakes', 'sandwiches', 'destroying', 'everything', 'land', 'on.To', 'be', 'honest', 'bad', 'things', 'have', 'come', 'not', 'really', 'one', 'worst', 'animated', 'films', 'time', 'were', 'few', 'jokes', 'did', 'make', 'did', 'music', 'Mark', 'Mothersbaugh', 'Unfortunately', 'still', 'animated', 'atrocity', 'basic', 'premise', 'children', 'book', 'food', 'falling', 'sky', 'etc', 'everything', 'else', 'not', 'animation', 'unpleasant', 'look', 'characters', 'are', 'unlikable', 'food', 'destruction', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'Again', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'one', 'everyone', 'else', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'am', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'Compared', 'book', 'big', 'letdown', 'opportunity', 'create', 'great', 'adaptation', 'been', 'wasted.Grade', 'D']",N/A

1242302,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B001UV4XXS,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[2, 2]","because it was adapted from a much beloved children's bookCloudy With a Chance of Meatballsbut changed so much that many lovers of the book version flat out hated the movie version.  Well, as someone who usually prefers the original book to the movie adaptation, I can sympathize with their feelings, but in this particular case I think they are missing out on a wonder, a truly brilliant movie, even if it has hardly anything to do with the original besides the basic premise of raining food.On a tiny (American owned?) island off the Atlantic coast of the USA in the one industry (sardine fishing and canning) town of Swallow Falls lives Flint Lockwood who as a boy covered the walls of his room with posters of great inventors and dreamed of emulating them, but his inventions never quite worked.  His earliest shown, created when he was a very young child, spray on shoes, while certainly solving the problem of untied shoelaces, have the downside of not coming off,...ever (Flint is shown still wearing them as a grown man), but inspired by the belief shown in him by his died-too-young mother and the closure of the Baby Brent Sardine cannery, which leaves the citizens of Swallow Falls stuck with eating the sardines the rest of the world no longer wants, Flint is determined to invent something great,... eventually.Unfortunately, his latest invention, for turning water into food, goes berserk during the opening of Sardine Land, the Mayor's desperate attempt to save the town through sardine tourism, and ends up wrecking it along with the budding career of the enthusiastic intern would-be weather girl Sam Sparks sent out to cover the event.  But as Flint is hiding from the wrath of everyone, a drop of mustard, a pickle, and a piece of cheese falling from the sky signal that Flint has finally invented something that works,...sort of.  Flint enjoys his never experienced praise and feelings of success as he produces one amazing food related weather event after another, Sam Sparks reports it, Flint's father expresses pessimistic doubts, and the Mayor pursues his ambitions.  But at the height of Flint's success Something Goes Wrong, and in the end it is up to a small band of heroes to save the World from Foodmageddon.What the preceding fails to convey is just how laugh out loud funny this is.  Joke-a-minute sight gags abound in what is nevertheless an intricately plotted Hero's Journey of a story.  In particular I was impressed by how carefully and how often ""pipes are laid"": little bits and incidents are briefly and casually shown that will pay off big time later.  Keep your eyes open; almost everything that happens early in the movie is referred back to later, despite the almost continuous jokes, a screenwriter's tour-de-force!  An exquisite score by Mark MothersbaughCloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)compliments the unlike anything I've ever seen computer animation.A couple of performances deserve special acclaim.  First, Mr. T is good sport enough to voice a character obviously intended as a parody of his entire career and to do it in the correct, ridiculously over the top manner.Second, Bruce Campbell and the animators manage to turn the Mayor into a not so subtle parody of Bill Clinton, done in by uncontrolled appetites and all, though in this case he's shown lusting uncontrollably after food.  How they slipped this one by Hollywood's political gatekeepers is something of a mystery.Note: A limited edition version was made including a so-called ""magic umbrella"" upon which the falling food pictures only show up when it gets wet.  Having purchased one at the time, I can tell you that the umbrella works exactly as described, but it looked so cheaply constructed that I put it away after a single test use.",5,And Again Another Movie that Never Should Have Worked,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,3790,"['was', 'adapted', 'much', 'beloved', 'children', 'bookCloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballsbut', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'many', 'lovers', 'book', 'version', 'flat', 'out', 'hated', 'movie', 'version', 'Well', 'someone', 'who', 'usually', 'original', 'book', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'can', 'sympathize', 'feelings', 'particular', 'case', 'think', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'wonder', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'even', 'hardly', 'anything', 'do', 'original', 'basic', 'premise', 'raining', 'food.On', 'tiny', 'American', 'owned', 'island', 'Atlantic', 'coast', 'USA', 'one', 'industry', 'sardine', 'fishing', 'canning', 'town', 'Swallow', 'Falls', 'Flint', 'Lockwood', 'who', 'boy', 'covered', 'walls', 'room', 'posters', 'great', 'inventors', 'dreamed', 'emulating', 'inventions', 'never', 'quite', 'worked', 'earliest', 'shown', 'created', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'child', 'spray', 'shoes', 'certainly', 'solving', 'problem', 'untied', 'shoelaces', 'have', 'downside', 'not', 'coming', 'off', 'ever', 'Flint', 'shown', 'still', 'wearing', 'grown', 'man', 'inspired', 'belief', 'shown', 'died-too-young', 'mother', 'closure', 'Baby', 'Brent', 'Sardine', 'cannery', 'citizens', 'Swallow', 'Falls', 'stuck', 'eating', 'sardines', 'rest', 'world', 'no', 'longer', 'Flint', 'determined', 'invent', 'something', 'great', 'eventually.Unfortunately', 'latest', 'invention', 'turning', 'water', 'food', 'berserk', 'opening', 'Sardine', 'Land', 'Mayor', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'save', 'town', 'sardine', 'tourism', 'up', 'wrecking', 'budding', 'career', 'enthusiastic', 'intern', 'would-be', 'weather', 'girl', 'Sam', 'Sparks', 'sent', 'out', 'cover', 'event', 'Flint', 'hiding', 'wrath', 'everyone', 'drop', 'mustard', 'pickle', 'piece', 'cheese', 'falling', 'sky', 'signal', 'Flint', 'finally', 'invented', 'something', 'sort', 'Flint', 'never', 'experienced', 'praise', 'feelings', 'success', 'one', 'amazing', 'food', 'related', 'weather', 'event', 'Sam', 'Sparks', 'Flint', 'father', 'pessimistic', 'doubts', 'Mayor', 'ambitions', 'height', 'Flint', 'success', 'Something', 'Goes', 'Wrong', 'end', 'up', 'small', 'band', 'heroes', 'save', 'World', 'Foodmageddon.What', 'preceding', 'fails', 'convey', 'just', 'how', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'Joke-a-minute', 'sight', 'gags', 'abound', 'what', 'nevertheless', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'Hero', 'Journey', 'story', 'particular', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'carefully', 'how', 'often', 'pipes', 'are', 'laid', 'little', 'bits', 'incidents', 'are', 'briefly', 'casually', 'shown', 'will', 'pay', 'off', 'big', 'time', 'later', 'Keep', 'eyes', 'open', 'almost', 'everything', 'early', 'movie', 'referred', 'back', 'later', 'almost', 'continuous', 'jokes', 'screenwriter', 'tour-de-force', 'exquisite', 'score', 'Mark', 'MothersbaughCloudy', 'A', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'Original', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Soundtrack', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'computer', 'animation.A', 'couple', 'performances', 'deserve', 'special', 'acclaim', 'First', 'Mr.', 'T', 'good', 'sport', 'enough', 'voice', 'character', 'obviously', 'intended', 'parody', 'entire', 'career', 'do', 'correct', 'ridiculously', 'top', 'manner.Second', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'animators', 'manage', 'turn', 'Mayor', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'parody', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'done', 'uncontrolled', 'appetites', 'though', 'case', 'shown', 'lusting', 'uncontrollably', 'food', 'How', 'slipped', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'political', 'gatekeepers', 'something', 'mystery.Note', 'limited', 'edition', 'version', 'was', 'made', 'including', 'so-called', 'magic', 'umbrella', 'falling', 'food', 'pictures', 'only', 'show', 'up', 'when', 'wet', 'Having', 'purchased', 'one', 'time', 'can', 'tell', 'umbrella', 'exactly', 'described', 'looked', 'so', 'cheaply', 'constructed', 'put', 'away', 'single', 'test', 'use']",N/A

But once the female character confesses how she used to be a nerd because she wore glasses, well, let's just say I was very saddened and offended by this.  I was wactching this with my beautiful and smart little boy who wears glasses and was just so upset that they decided to keep this stereotype going.  The whole ""four-eyes"" chant was really over the top.  Is this movie supposed to be the 1970s when girls had to act stupid and we taunted kids who need glasses?  Being visually impaired is a handicap, not a joke.  We don't chose to put on a pair of glasses just so we can look ""nerdy.""  And what is perhaps even a worse lesson for kids and girls especially is how the girl used to love science and then pretends to be stupid so she can be popular.  Then she says something like ""and no one ever made fun of me again.""  Yes in the end of course the two nerds save the day, but the damage is already done.

Alford,"[0, 0]","With the prior success of Open Season and Surfs Up scoring them some points in theatres, Sony Pictures Animation followed up with a movie based on the children's story from the 1970s by Judi & Ron Barrett. This relatively short book was concieved into being a full-length motion picture by Chris Miller and Phil Lord, who created the cult MTV animated series, Clone High.Set on a small island off the American east coast, Flint Lockwood is a tinkerer who has spent a good portion of his life coming up with invention-after-invention, all of which have failed, including his spray-on shoes which have never come off since he put tested them on himself as a kid. His father wants him to help around his tackle shop, but Flint tries one more take at achieving his dream of being a great inventor. He makes a machine that is supposed to transform water into any kind of desired food, but he ends up accidently sending it into the atmosphere which starts turning the moisture in the air into random food. Flint manages to set up a way of controlling the machine so that he can make it rain whatever food the townspeople want. The greedy mayor convinces him to help use this as a tourist attraction for the town, but Flint mainly wants to do this to impress Sam, the cute weather reporter from New York reporting on the falling food phenomenon. He even goes to the lengths of making an entire castle made of jello to win her over. Unfortunately, the machine goes haywire, and starts dropping giant entries all over the globe. Flint and Sam, along with their mistmatched crew, head off in Flint's jet car(which now has wings!)into the eye of the food-storm, and manage to stop the machine before the entire world is covered in takeout, even though everyone in the town has to escape on pizza-boats.I'll was really impressed with the animation in this. What really bought it for me was the cartoonish look of the characters and the world they lived in, while keeping it very detailed and slightly realistic. The movie goes the extra step to ellaborate  from the original source material of how the small town started having it rain food. It pays homage to alot of disaster flicks, and this shows with the hilarious scenes of entire cities being ravaged by falling giant pancakes. There are some intensely funny moments in this, and I loved all the running gags with Flint's failed former experiments. It's a clever comedy for the whole family, and any film that has both Bruce Campbell and Mr. T in it is a solid win!",4,Beware of falling french fries,1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,2509,"['prior', 'success', 'Open', 'Season', 'Surfs', 'Up', 'scoring', 'points', 'theatres', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'Animation', 'followed', 'up', 'movie', 'based', 'children', 'story', '1970s', 'Judi', 'Ron', 'Barrett', 'relatively', 'short', 'book', 'was', 'concieved', 'being', 'full-length', 'motion', 'picture', 'Chris', 'Miller', 'Phil', 'Lord', 'who', 'created', 'cult', 'MTV', 'animated', 'series', 'Clone', 'High.Set', 'small', 'island', 'American', 'east', 'coast', 'Flint', 'Lockwood', 'tinkerer', 'who', 'spent', 'good', 'portion', 'life', 'coming', 'up', 'invention-after-invention', 'have', 'failed', 'including', 'spray-on', 'shoes', 'have', 'never', 'come', 'off', 'put', 'tested', 'kid', 'father', 'help', 'tackle', 'shop', 'Flint', 'one', 'more', 'take', 'achieving', 'dream', 'being', 'great', 'inventor', 'machine', 'supposed', 'transform', 'water', 'kind', 'desired', 'food', 'up', 'accidently', 'sending', 'atmosphere', 'turning', 'moisture', 'air', 'random', 'food', 'Flint', 'manages', 'set', 'up', 'way', 'controlling', 'machine', 'so', 'can', 'make', 'rain', 'food', 'townspeople', 'want', 'greedy', 'mayor', 'convinces', 'help', 'use', 'tourist', 'attraction', 'town', 'Flint', 'mainly', 'do', 'impress', 'Sam', 'cute', 'weather', 'reporter', 'New', 'York', 'reporting', 'falling', 'food', 'phenomenon', 'even', 'lengths', 'making', 'entire', 'castle', 'made', 'jello', 'win', 'over', 'Unfortunately', 'machine', 'haywire', 'dropping', 'giant', 'entries', 'globe', 'Flint', 'Sam', 'mistmatched', 'crew', 'head', 'off', 'Flint', 'jet', 'car', 'now', 'wings', 'eye', 'food-storm', 'manage', 'stop', 'machine', 'entire', 'world', 'covered', 'takeout', 'even', 'everyone', 'town', 'escape', 'pizza-boats.I', ""'ll"", 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'animation', 'What', 'really', 'bought', 'was', 'cartoonish', 'look', 'characters', 'world', 'lived', 'keeping', 'very', 'detailed', 'slightly', 'realistic', 'movie', 'extra', 'step', 'ellaborate', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'how', 'small', 'town', 'started', 'having', 'rain', 'food', 'homage', 'alot', 'disaster', 'flicks', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'entire', 'cities', 'being', 'ravaged', 'falling', 'giant', 'pancakes', 'are', 'intensely', 'funny', 'moments', 'loved', 'running', 'gags', 'Flint', 'failed', 'former', 'experiments', 'clever', 'comedy', 'whole', 'family', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Mr.', 'T', 'solid', 'win']",N/A
1242322,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B001UV4XXS,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[1, 2]","Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) is an inventor. Well, he wants to be an inventor, but everything he invents starts off appearing to work before going strangely or horribly awry. The town he lives in of Swallow Falls has been eating nothing but sardines for years, so Flint turns his attention to creating an invention that turns water into food. When the invention works, Flint goes from being a bumbling nerd to one of the most important people in town as his machine rains down food on Swallow Falls three times a day. But when his invention gains a mind of it's own, Flint has to stop it before it tries to destroy the world.Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs was a best selling children's book written in 1978 by Judi Barrett. And in a year that saw it's fair share of children's books turned to movies (Fantastic Mr. Fox, Where the Wild Things Are, Inkheart, Coraline, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, etc.) it only seemed right that this book would see it's day come in the theater this year as well. Of course, when turning a beloved children's book into a movie you typically wouldn't expect the studios to turn to a pair of largely untested writers/ directors with the adaptation. But that's what they did when they picked Phil Lord and Chris Miller (How I Met Your Mother, Clone High, etc.) to direct the movie. Having written and directed for TV they didn't really seem like they would be the top choice to take on a project of this magnitude.But in the end they were the perfect auteurs to take on this project. Part of what really sets this movie apart from a lot of animated movies that come out nowadays is the ridiculousness of the proceedings. Where most animated movies these days tries to base some of their world in reality, Cloudy seems to take more of it's queues from the slapstick of Looney Tunes and other cartoons that came before it. Of course it also helps that this movie also has a voice cast of comedic actors (Bill Hader, Andy Samberg, Will Forte, Neill Patrick Harris, Anna Faris), actors that have become parodies of themselves and are willing to play off the parody (Mr. T, Al Roker), and just plain great actors (James Caan, Benjamin Bratt, Bruce Campbell) to help this movie get over the top without actually being too over the top to keep your interest. At no point does this movie feel like it's veering perilously close to going over the edge, and with a somewhat sentimental ending, it stays just silly enough to keep from being mired in a sugar overload. Visually, like a lot of computer animated features that have come out this year, the movie looks like it could be claymation or another form of stop motion animation, giving it that extra dimension of realism (although I didn't see it in 3D, you could see the effects of the 3D on the 2D version of the movie.I highly recommend this movie. As an animated feature it's refreshing to see an animated feature that has humanity, while also having a certain playfulness that seems to be lost on a lot of movies these days. Give it a try, I know I'm going to end up buying it.5/5",5,Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,3072,"['Flint', 'Lockwood', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'inventor', 'Well', 'be', 'inventor', 'everything', 'appearing', 'work', 'going', 'strangely', 'horribly', 'awry', 'town', 'Swallow', 'Falls', 'been', 'eating', 'nothing', 'sardines', 'years', 'so', 'Flint', 'attention', 'creating', 'invention', 'water', 'food', 'When', 'invention', 'Flint', 'being', 'bumbling', 'nerd', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'people', 'town', 'machine', 'down', 'food', 'Swallow', 'Falls', 'three', 'times', 'day', 'when', 'invention', 'gains', 'mind', 'own', 'Flint', 'stop', 'destroy', 'world.Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'was', 'best', 'selling', 'children', 'book', 'written', '1978', 'Judi', 'Barrett', 'year', 'saw', 'fair', 'share', 'children', 'books', 'turned', 'movies', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'Inkheart', 'Coraline', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'etc', 'only', 'seemed', 'right', 'book', 'would', 'see', 'day', 'come', 'theater', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'when', 'turning', 'beloved', 'children', 'book', 'movie', 'typically', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'studios', 'turn', 'pair', 'largely', 'untested', 'writers/', 'directors', 'adaptation', 'what', 'did', 'when', 'picked', 'Phil', 'Lord', 'Chris', 'Miller', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'Clone', 'High', 'etc', 'direct', 'movie', 'Having', 'written', 'directed', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'would', 'be', 'top', 'choice', 'take', 'project', 'magnitude.But', 'end', 'were', 'perfect', 'take', 'project', 'Part', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'apart', 'lot', 'animated', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'nowadays', 'ridiculousness', 'proceedings', 'Where', 'most', 'animated', 'movies', 'days', 'tries', 'base', 'world', 'reality', 'Cloudy', 'take', 'more', 'queues', 'slapstick', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'other', 'cartoons', 'came', 'course', 'also', 'movie', 'also', 'voice', 'cast', 'comedic', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'Will', 'Forte', 'Neill', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'actors', 'have', 'become', 'parodies', 'are', 'willing', 'play', 'off', 'parody', 'Mr.', 'T', 'Al', 'Roker', 'just', 'plain', 'great', 'actors', 'James', 'Caan', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'help', 'movie', 'get', 'top', 'actually', 'being', 'too', 'top', 'keep', 'interest', 'point', 'movie', 'feel', 'veering', 'perilously', 'close', 'going', 'edge', 'somewhat', 'sentimental', 'ending', 'just', 'silly', 'enough', 'keep', 'being', 'mired', 'sugar', 'overload', 'Visually', 'lot', 'computer', 'animated', 'features', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'claymation', 'form', 'stop', 'motion', 'animation', 'giving', 'extra', 'dimension', 'realism', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', '3D', 'could', 'see', 'effects', '3D', '2D', 'version', 'movie.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'animated', 'feature', 'refreshing', 'see', 'animated', 'feature', 'humanity', 'also', 'having', 'certain', 'playfulness', 'be', 'lost', 'lot', 'movies', 'days', 'Give', 'try', 'know', ""'m"", 'going', 'end', 'up', 'buying', 'it.5/5']",N/A

When the rest of the world finds out that sardines are disgusting (what took them so long?), the town's economy begins to tank.  Seeing the town's impending doom, the gluttonous Mayor (voiced by Bruce Campbell) decides to bolster the economy and tourism with an amusement park based upon the town's rich sardine history.Along with his monkey STEVE!, who conveys simple thought in one-sentence yelps, Flintlock sees this as his calling to save the town by creating a water-to-food machine that needs just a little more power.  Upon the park's grand opening, Flint evades the watchful eyes of his disapproving father (voiced by James Caan) and the hovering local cop (voiced by Mr. T) - both of whom have seem the dangerous results of inventions gone astray - to connect his contraption up to the local power station.  The resulting explosion sends the town into chaos, Flintlock into hiding, and the machine into the clouds.  Where it begins to rain down delicious burgers upon the unfortunate town and local weather girl Sam Sparks (voiced by Anna Faris) covers the phenomenon and gets her big break.  Everyone wins, right?  That is, until the Dangeometer on Flint's contraption crosses into the YELLOW! and food begins to over-mutate, turning every falling treat into a Man vs. Food challenge and eventually creating a spaghetti tornado.  Will the town survive the foodalanche?  It's up to Flint and Sam (and STEVE!) to peak through the clouds at the machine run amok.It seems no children's movie is complete without the sermon nowadays.  And Cloudy is no different, providing easily relatable relationship dynamics, and lessons in overindulgence.  The difference is, this movie does it almost subliminally, coating the stomach with enough comedy to wash down the medicine.This is a very spirited, quick-witted, and funny movie, with enough originality and inventiveness for me to give it my highest possible recommendation.

""A New Yorker""","[1, 2]","Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's adaptation of Judi and Ron Barrett's 1978 children's book is as subtle as a giant pancake crushing a house. It's always a challenge to take a well loved story and adapt it to film. Often it involves cutting much of the story to make the film a manageable length. Fans of books often react negatively to such changes. Without the exposure of the book, the family and I went into this film with an open mine.In the movie, it starts out as a gentle story of a grandfather telling a sweet bedtime story to his granddaughter about a town where the weather was always food. Barring the `culinary climate' angle, all the gentleness has gone, replaced by a comically frantic tale of an obsessed young inventor, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), who, with his trusted monkey-friend Steve (Neil Patrick Harris), has spent his entire life dedicated to making his wild visions a reality (two of which - a TV with legs and a rat-pigeon crossbreed - figure hilariously in the film's story). His mother Fran (Lauren Graham) was his inspiration, but her passing leaves Flint with only his gruff, insular dad Tim (James Caan) to impress, and that isn't easy. Later in the story the land's weather takes the form of food, which in time becomes a problem, forcing the population of Chew and swallow to leave their home. The film has that as a core, but has developed an entire story to explain how that phenomenon came to be--the work of a nerdy inventor, Flint Lockwood, who just wants to make the world a better place. His inventions through the years have been busts. His latest machine makes food out of water, but when it goes ballistic and ends up in the clouds, the weather turns to food first by raining cheeseburgers, really cute.Along the way, the story gives me something of a basic introduction to sin. I found it interesting that six of the attitudes often called the Seven Deadly Sins made their way into this story. Brent, the town celebrity, is the embodiment of sloth and hubris. The Mayor is a combination of greed, gluttony, and envy. Earl (Mr. T), the town policeman, often reflects anger, even though he also has a soft and loving side. (The deadly sin missing is lust.) Each of these ""deadly sins"" brings complications to the story, just as they inevitably bring sorrow into life.The family and I did embrace the craziness of its central premise, Cloudy delivers a surprisingly appetizing dish of fast-paced lunacy, sprinkled with some memorable characters for instance Mr. T's and peppered with great one-liners. (Look out for the TV anchorman who remarks on the fact that Flint's malfunctioning doohickey, in true Armageddon fashion, strikes familiar national landmarks first before moving on to surrounding areas.)

All the usual ones that have puffed up kids films for a century now, and they still work and are always welcome when handled well.But the added bonus in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is the inspired lunacy of its laughs - the big spoonful of sugar that makes the moral medicine palatable, even negligible.

Too often, what should be an amusing tidbit for children turns out to be a flaccid vehicle for a ""star"" (I'm thinking Bee Movie) or an inexcusable political commentary (like Wall-E or Happy Feet.) But happily, I was completely delighted with CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS.The list of voice actors for CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS is impressive, reading like a list of SNL alums and more. My favorite, OF COURSE, was Mister T, whose character sported an inverse Mohawk. But the voice actors had a lot to work with here. The script for CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS is creative and clever, as are many of the sight-gags. The animation and the 3-D are both respectable and the 3-D is not abused (or necessary, really.) Visually, what struck me even more than the food falling from the sky was the colors. I know that sounds odd, but even the Columbia logo at the start was exceptionally rich. And once the food machine kicks in, that richness is spread across the town.The writers really did a great job of turning a cute little kids book into a cute little movie.

The main character Flint Lockwood even has wild hair, reminiscent of Lewis in that they both stick out a lot.The central plot in ""Meatballs"" revolves around this struggle for Flint to make a scientific invention that works, in which failed attempts include creatures such as ""ratbirds"" and ""spray on shoes"", and gain acceptance from his father and from the town.  He is working on an invention (for comedy purposes, I will not disclose the name of said invention)  that will, he hopes, turn water in to food.  This also coincides with the reopening of the town he lives (Swallow Falls) in, instituted by the Mayor Shelbourne (which is brilliantly voiced by Bruce Camopbell) to help bolster the failing economy, both the fate of the town and Flint collide at the reopening ceremony and kicks the film in to fast-paced odd-ball humor gear.What made this movie so fresh, and yet so simultaneously jarring was the film's unabashed silly sense of humor that plays very well of society's cliches and roles that we accept for ourselves due to peer pressure and expectations. A lot of the humor will go over the heads of children, when I saw it, out of a theater that was about 1/4 full, I was the only one laughing for the first 30mins until other adults (with children) realized it was a-okay to laugh.  There are definitely parts of the movie that will appeal to children, such as the idea of rain that is food, ice cram snow, and a good dose of slap-stick humor, but all of this is rounded out extremely well with a an awareness of its source material and the choice to flesh out the story.The dynamics of the relationship between Flint and his father are just great, and certainly ring true for me and a lot of friends I know as well (not the dead mother part), but  its nice to see a relationship like this handled sensitively and what I was expecting to be a mind-numbingly stupid movie.  The dynamics between Sam and Flint is fun as well and while treading cliches actually makes what could have been a boring romantic side-story is actually fun and fresh.The only quibble I have with this movie is the same thing I enjoyed so much about the movie, its silly and irreverent sense of humor, is also its biggest weakness.  Even though the last 1/2 hour is completely ridiculous, it works and makes it a step above most supposedly children movies.  This movie, for me, at least, is one that looks to be destined as a cult classic, it is wacky and silly enough to become one, but not mainstream or innovative enough in its script to become a classic movie.If you enjoy movies that are silly and a bit out there that still have some brains, than you will definitely enjoy ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"", if you don't have a somewhat goofy and dry (almost British) sense of humor, than you probably should just ignore this.  If anything, it will inspire more interest in its source material.God Bless ~AmyEDIT (11-19-09):  Since I wrote this review, I read the book of ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and is a good book, and I am very impressed with how they expand the story from the book, they did a very commendable job considering how short the book is.  :)",4,Much better than the previews let on.,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,3947,"['probably', 'good', 'thing', 'expectations', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'was', 'zero', 'movie', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'source', 'material', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'MeatballsHaving', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'only', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'previews', 'seemed', 'would', 'be', 'middling', 'CG', 'film', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.The', 'premise', 'revolving', 'inventor', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'success', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'common', 'Robinsons', 'also', 'based', 'off', 'children', 'bookA', 'Day', 'Wilbur', 'Robinson', 'successfully', 'story', 'source', 'material', 'unique', 'kooky', 'sense', 'humor', 'main', 'character', 'Flint', 'Lockwood', 'even', 'wild', 'hair', 'reminiscent', 'Lewis', 'stick', 'out', 'lot.The', 'central', 'plot', 'Meatballs', 'struggle', 'Flint', 'make', 'scientific', 'invention', 'failed', 'attempts', 'include', 'creatures', 'such', 'ratbirds', 'spray', 'shoes', 'gain', 'acceptance', 'father', 'town', 'working', 'invention', 'comedy', 'purposes', 'will', 'not', 'disclose', 'name', 'said', 'invention', 'will', 'turn', 'water', 'food', 'also', 'reopening', 'town', 'Swallow', 'Falls', 'instituted', 'Mayor', 'Shelbourne', 'brilliantly', 'voiced', 'Bruce', 'Camopbell', 'help', 'bolster', 'failing', 'economy', 'fate', 'town', 'Flint', 'collide', 'reopening', 'ceremony', 'film', 'fast-paced', 'odd-ball', 'humor', 'gear.What', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'fresh', 'yet', 'so', 'simultaneously', 'jarring', 'was', 'film', 'unabashed', 'silly', 'sense', 'humor', 'very', 'well', 'society', 'cliches', 'roles', 'accept', 'ourselves', 'due', 'peer', 'pressure', 'expectations', 'lot', 'humor', 'will', 'go', 'heads', 'children', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', 'was', '1/4', 'full', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'laughing', 'first', '30mins', 'other', 'adults', 'children', 'realized', 'was', 'a-okay', 'laugh', 'are', 'definitely', 'parts', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'children', 'such', 'idea', 'rain', 'food', 'ice', 'cram', 'snow', 'good', 'dose', 'slap-stick', 'humor', 'rounded', 'out', 'extremely', 'well', 'awareness', 'source', 'material', 'choice', 'flesh', 'out', 'story.The', 'dynamics', 'relationship', 'Flint', 'father', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'certainly', 'ring', 'true', 'lot', 'friends', 'know', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'dead', 'mother', 'part', 'nice', 'see', 'relationship', 'handled', 'sensitively', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'mind-numbingly', 'stupid', 'movie', 'dynamics', 'Sam', 'Flint', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'treading', 'cliches', 'actually', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'boring', 'romantic', 'side-story', 'actually', 'fun', 'only', 'quibble', 'have', 'movie', 'same', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'silly', 'irreverent', 'sense', 'humor', 'also', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'Even', 'last', '1/2', 'hour', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'step', 'most', 'supposedly', 'children', 'movies', 'movie', 'least', 'one', 'be', 'destined', 'cult', 'classic', 'wacky', 'silly', 'enough', 'become', 'one', 'not', 'mainstream', 'innovative', 'enough', 'script', 'become', 'classic', 'movie.If', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'are', 'silly', 'bit', 'there', 'still', 'have', 'brains', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'somewhat', 'goofy', 'dry', 'almost', 'British', 'sense', 'humor', 'probably', 'should', 'just', 'ignore', 'anything', 'will', 'inspire', 'more', 'interest', 'source', 'material.God', 'Bless', '~AmyEDIT', '11-19-09', 'wrote', 'review', 'read', 'book', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'good', 'book', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'how', 'expand', 'story', 'book', 'did', 'very', 'commendable', 'job', 'considering', 'how', 'short', 'book']",N/A

However, I was amazed at the creative and beautiful artwork of the animation, no matter how crazy the story.  (I am sure kids will love this with food falling from the sky - especially jelly beans and ice cream)  The story is about a nerd, an only child, who loves to invent things.  His name is Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), and of course his mother has faith in him, but his father just wants him to work with him at his Sardine Shop.  His Rube Goldberg-like contraptions are fun and imaginative.  His weather machine turns rain into food, so a disaster ensues of too much food raining down on the tiny island they live on.  It has wisps of a disaster news story like the recent  Indonesian and Japanese Tsunamis.  However it is light and  full of wildly imaginative twists and turns.

Still, he never gives up, hoping one day to be liked by people in general and loved by his father (James Caan).Flint lives in the town of Swallow Falls on a little island in the middle of the ocean.  The town is suffering a severe depression since the sardine cannery in town has shut down.  In fact, the residents are now forced to eat the smelly fish.  So Flint decides to make a machine that will turn water into food.The bad news is the machine gets away from him.  The good news is that it works.  Soon, the residents are enjoying a wide variety of food every day.  But can Flint keep his machine under control?I would have written this movie off as too childish if it weren't for my roommate, who really wanted to see it.  But I'm glad he talked me into it since it was entertaining.  There were some great laughs, not only at the absurd situations but also at some great sight gags.  In fact, the creative spirit of the original book is certainly evident with some of the gags.Since it is based on a picture book, they really did have to stretch the story, and a couple of times it showed.  But for the most part, the story moved forward at a steady pace.The themes of the move are the familiar be true to yourself and love your family.  At times, they were a tad preachy, but for the most part they were an integral part of the story.  They were certainly predictable, and I had most of the character arcs figured out within the first few minutes.The climax stretches on for a while.  When it finds the characters trying to stop ever bigger problems, that's a good thing.  However, they also shoe horn in some of the character moments, which feel awkward in the middle of the action and ultimately slow things down.This movie isn't destined for any best of lists, but it is funny.  Kids, the target audience, will love it.  And adults willing to admit that kids' movies can be good will enjoy it at least once.",4,A Better Version of the Book Than I Expected,1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,2059,"['life', 'Flint', 'Lockwood', 'voiced', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'wanted', 'be', 'inventor', 'inventions', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'disaster', 'Still', 'never', 'up', 'hoping', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'liked', 'people', 'general', 'loved', 'father', 'James', 'Caan', '.Flint', 'lives', 'town', 'Swallow', 'Falls', 'little', 'island', 'middle', 'ocean', 'town', 'suffering', 'severe', 'depression', 'sardine', 'cannery', 'town', 'shut', 'down', 'fact', 'residents', 'are', 'now', 'forced', 'eat', 'smelly', 'fish', 'So', 'Flint', 'make', 'machine', 'will', 'turn', 'water', 'food.The', 'bad', 'news', 'machine', 'away', 'good', 'news', 'Soon', 'residents', 'are', 'enjoying', 'wide', 'variety', 'food', 'day', 'can', 'Flint', 'keep', 'machine', 'control', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'movie', 'off', 'too', 'childish', 'were', ""n't"", 'roommate', 'who', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', ""'m"", 'glad', 'talked', 'was', 'entertaining', 'were', 'great', 'laughs', 'not', 'only', 'absurd', 'situations', 'also', 'great', 'sight', 'gags', 'fact', 'creative', 'spirit', 'original', 'book', 'certainly', 'evident', 'gags.Since', 'based', 'picture', 'book', 'really', 'did', 'have', 'stretch', 'story', 'couple', 'times', 'showed', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'moved', 'forward', 'steady', 'pace.The', 'themes', 'move', 'are', 'familiar', 'be', 'true', 'love', 'family', 'times', 'were', 'tad', 'preachy', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'integral', 'part', 'story', 'were', 'certainly', 'predictable', 'had', 'most', 'character', 'arcs', 'figured', 'out', 'first', 'few', 'minutes.The', 'climax', 'stretches', 'while', 'When', 'characters', 'trying', 'stop', 'ever', 'bigger', 'problems', 'good', 'thing', 'However', 'also', 'shoe', 'horn', 'character', 'moments', 'feel', 'awkward', 'middle', 'action', 'ultimately', 'slow', 'things', 'down.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'destined', 'best', 'lists', 'funny', 'Kids', 'target', 'audience', 'will', 'love', 'adults', 'willing', 'admit', 'kids', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'will', 'enjoy', 'least', 'once']",N/A
1242373,A129YBX5BVNW2,B001UV4XXS,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 0]","&#34;Have you ever felt like you were a little bit different?&#34;It took nearly three years to bring 2009's &#34;Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs&#34; to the big screen - and after watching 86 minutes of its digitally realized anarchic genius - I can safely say it was money well spent. Not only is Columbia/Sony Animation Pictures baby a visually sumptuous watch - it's properly funny for its entire duration, genuinely touching when it needs to be and endlessly inventive in both character and dialogue. It also boasts something rarer than a conscience in the UKIP party - a moral centre that's not stylized schlock - but a story that's loaded with pressing observations about avarice in our increasingly chubby consumerist society. All this and it's effortless cool too. The audience was both smiling and applauding when the credits rolled in our cinema.Flint Lockwood (voiced to perfection by Bill Hader) is a nerdy school kid - always inflicting his scatological inventions on his parents, his classmates and the good townsfolk of Swallow Falls - a tiny island situated on the map beneath the 'A' on Atlantic. Swallow Falls is the Sardine Capitol of the World - a town that lives on and off the shiny oily silver mites - and Flint's Dad (of Tim's Sardine Bait & Tackle Shop) is proud of it. Flint's father is hard working for sure but since Mom died 10 years back has become safe and unadventurous and prone to mumbling fish metaphors that don't make any sense (a stunning turn by James Caan).Dad also lives in terror of his son creating yet another 'disaster' like his tin of Spray-On Shoes (to solve the epidemic of untied shoelaces) or his genetically mutated RatBirds (rats with wings that steal kids lunches), his Hair Un-Balder Potion (that produces a woolly mammoth of a man's skull instead of an even rug) or his Monkey Thought Translator Machine. But these are the least of the town's problems - because soon the world discovers that 'Sardines Are Super Gross' - and all life in Swallow Falls goes grey and into terminal decline...Now grown up - Flint is in his homemade computer hub situated in the Water Tower above a Porta-Dump cubicle in the garden. With his official lab coat on (given to him by his Mom) and with his trusty pet monkey Steve by his side (spouting monosyllabic words through the thought translator) - Flint's working furiously on his ultimate invention - a device that will win back the town and make him beloved of everybody. It's a 'Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator' - a device that will turn water into any food you want. &#34;Calibrating flavour patterns, radiation matrix secure, uploading cool machine voice...&#34; Flint enthuses as he slaps the keyboard again - his huge bug eyes bulging with madcap inventiveness as he gazes at his dietary lunar-lander.Meanwhile - the fame-hungry Mayor of Swallow Falls (a fabulously sly voiceover by Bruce Campbell of The Evil Dead and Bubba Ho-Tep fame) tries to reignite interest in the town by opening a boring theme park called SARDINE LAND with Baby Brent as it's star attraction (a child who used to be on every Sardine tin but is now a dumb boor with a huge midriff). The scheming Mayor gingerly tells the gathered populace &#34;without consulting anyone, I've spent the entire town's budget on this thing...&#34; But again an over-enthusiastic Flint ruins everything. Needing 17,000 Mega gigajoules to get his machine to work - he plugs into the island's power grid and wrecks the whole stage show. To make matters worse - a cute and super-perky WNN Weather Channel Intern called Sam Sparks (great vocal work from Anna Faris) has come to town with Manny her pint-sized cameraman to report on the island's re-launch. But along with a humiliated Dad Tim - she watches the mayhem of yet another Flint 'disaster' - Swallow Falls loses its 'F' (along with everything else) and Flint's rocket-propelled food maker disappears upwards into the sky. A mortified Flint hides down by the Docks with his pet monkey Steve...But then something magical happens - up in the atmosphere - the chugging device is sucking in clouds and starts to spit out slices of cheese and cucumber and then a bap - and the next thing you know it's raining fully-formed cheeseburgers on Swallow Falls. Now realizing that BIGGER IS BETTER - the Major wants Flint to run the machine three-times-a-day for 30 days until the cruise ships arrive and Swallow Falls conquers national TV as a culinary pig-out destination.In the meantime Flint's new machine becomes food-request central for the locals - Eggs, Toast, Orange Juice, Bacon, Ice Cream, Fudge, Jelly Beans. Cue jokes about &#34;...poultry in motion...&#34; and &#34;...you may have seen a meteor shower, but you never seen a story meatier than this!&#34; And the gastronomic overload is kept in check by a 'DangeOMeter' in Flint's lab that will tell him if things are getting out of mutating hand. But of course they do. Greed begins to take over - and soon a spaghetti twister is sucking up the buildings and children and a 'Vegas All You Can Eat' food storm brought on by the hideously bloated Mayor threatens to engulf every major city in the world unless Flint can stop the gluttonous madness...The voices of Mr. T as Earl the Town policeman and Andy Samberg as Baby Brent add hugely to the great fun set pieces - but it's Hollywood veteran James Caan with his furrowed eyebrows and croaky mumble who actually steals the show. His speech to his son Flint at the end of the film is both funny and emotional - a wonderfully written double whammy for a cartoon.And the visuals are of course fabulous. Not only does the food look good enough to eat - there's over 50 different kinds portrayed with mouth-watering detail - a Nacho Cheese Hot Spring, A Marshmallow Warehouse, an Anti-Gas Tablet Shop, Mouth Funnels to catch the food as it falls from the sky. The massive pancake, butter knob and syrup that dollops on an entire house - is stunning to look at. A cherry lands on top of a leftovers food mountain and the damn holding it all back finally bursts...The 'making of' featurettes show you how the scenes are built up and the painstaking details applied - how to make an olive crush a building - what does a banana look like when its rolling down a street - how a burger in a bap falls apart when it hits the ground - how do you capture the texture and colour of Flint and Sam romancing in a giant Jell-O Castle...Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio: English 5.1 with an English Audio Descriptive Track - while Subtitles are in English For The Hard Of Hearing and Hindi.Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and adapted by Rob Greenberg from the Judi and Ron Barrett children's book of the same name - &#34;Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs&#34; was put onto BLU RAY in early 2010 as a 'Combi Pack' with the DVD (and in a snazzy card slipcase). A 'Cloudy 2' sequel appeared in cinemas September 2013 and the BLU RAY for that came out in February of this year.&#34;The world needs your originality Flint...&#34; his mother tells him. I agree.In 2014 - you can pick it up the first movie for under a fiver in the UK.

So he invents a machine that will cause it to rain any type of food he asks.Anna Faris is the voice of Sam, a television reporter seeking her big break. She's on the site for when the gizmo begins and the sky begins raining food.The townspeople are exited for the new choices and Flint is the new celebrity, but the only person he wants recognition from is his father, Tim (voiced by James Caan) who doesn't like technology and wants things to go back to the way things were.As expected, things begin to go haywire and the food begins to mutate. It's up to Flint and Sam to fly up to the clouds and stop the food from falling.As I said, the first half of the film is hilarious.

But his inventions are never fully understood by the villagers and he is considered a good for for nothing  among the villagers. Unfortunately crisis also  has reached Swallow Falls and with its once important sardine industry in decline the mayor has decided to rise the town  with some publicity and the always reliable thematic park.  One day our hero makes the definite machine, one  which can convert water into  food . And so it starts a story  which has everything: unethical poilticians, father-son relationships, catastrophes, romance and Manny ,by far my favourite.It is funny all the time, although  it loses a little rythm at the last quarter.I have not read the book in which the film is based so I cannot compare, but if it is half the fun I will be satisfied.One of those films you watch enjoying like a child and the kind you do not mind to spend 6 on it.",4,"Fun, fun, fun!",1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,1543,"['Considering', 'price', 'tickets', 'going', 'movies', 'becoming', 'quite', 'reflexive', 'act', 'other', 'hand', 'when', 'have', 'nieces', 'need', 'overlook', 'little', 'tiny', 'monetary', 'details', 'So', 'lately', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'lot', 'so', 'called', 'films', 'kids', 'have', 'say', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'many', 'considered', 'serious', 'film.Take', 'one', 'story', 'maybe', 'absurd', 'childish', 'too', 'fantastic', 'film', 'been', 'made', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'everybody', 'matter', 'age.Flint', 'Loockwood', 'tiny', 'island', 'Swallow', 'Falls', 'biggest', 'dream', 'be', 'greatest', 'scientist', 'world', 'making', 'inventions', 'will', 'help', 'people', 'inventions', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'understood', 'villagers', 'considered', 'good', 'nothing', 'villagers', 'Unfortunately', 'crisis', 'also', 'reached', 'Swallow', 'Falls', 'once', 'important', 'sardine', 'industry', 'decline', 'mayor', 'decided', 'rise', 'town', 'publicity', 'always', 'reliable', 'thematic', 'park', 'One', 'day', 'hero', 'definite', 'machine', 'one', 'can', 'convert', 'water', 'food', 'story', 'everything', 'unethical', 'poilticians', 'father-son', 'relationships', 'catastrophes', 'romance', 'Manny', 'far', 'favourite.It', 'funny', 'time', 'little', 'rythm', 'last', 'quarter.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'fun', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied.One', 'films', 'watch', 'enjoying', 'child', 'kind', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'spend', '6']",N/A

Even though the plot is weak, the idea is imaginative, and although I'm not in the target market of kids, I still enjoyed it as an adult.Flint Lockwood is an inventor.  Always has been, ever since he was a little kid.  But the problem is, none of his inventions ever seem to work out.  On the day of a big reveal in his hometown, he decides to test out another invention.  This one, is supposed to turn water into food, a real treat considering his town mostly eats sardines.  But things go awry and his machine shoots up into the sky.  But then, strange things start happening, and it starts raining food, and his invention becomes a bigger success than even Flint could imagine.  But with great power comes great responsibility, and it doesn't seem as if Flint and his hometown can handle the wondrous invention.Characters:Bill Hader as Flint Lockwood.Anna Faris as Sam SparksNeil Patrick Harris as Steve the MonkeyJames Caan as Tim LockwoodBruce Campbell as Mayor ShelbourneAndy Samberg as Brent McHaleMr. T as Officer Earl DevereauxI can't say that any of the cast was stellar.  Well except Neil Patrick Harris, he's always awesome.  And he plays a monkey, so it's not like he can screw that up.  But Hader, Faris, and all the others, there just wasn't any chemistry there.  They all were perky and upbeat, but since it's an animated film it made it even harder for them to seem like real people.  A lot of the characters, not counting the voicing, are simply unbelievable too.  While there's some good lessons learned (like express love for your children and make them feel appreciated) a lot of it was overly sappy.  And the love story, don't even get me started.And there were some plot holes.  Like why I send a weather girl to film a story about a town unveiling something?  Although it served later on when the food weather came about.  But overall the story was extremely cute.  Who wouldn't love it to rain food once in awhile?  Although too much of something can make it bad, I really wouldn't mind it raining skittles or something at times.  That's just fun.  And really, the animation is why you would watch this movie.  It was spectacular, with the use of food raining from the sky and all the different types that came down.  Visually it was cheerful and a lot of fun and I can see why this would be a popular kids movie.  And everything in it was appropriate for kids too.  No cussing, nudity, etc. Although there is a guy in a diaper, but that has a story behind it too.The music was ok.  Mostly upbeat and instrumental.  I really didn't pay that much attention to it as it was just background noise.  And that's all it was supposed to be.  This wasn't a sing-along or a musical.  So no complaints there.A very cute movie and one you can forgive for its many flaws.  It's the type you can watch over and over again and probably still find some detail you missed before.Review by M.

Of course, like any good cartoon, the machine goes awry and our protagonists must team up to save their home.  The animation is good, but not meant to be jaw-droppping realism.  The soundtrack is good, and the dialogue is snappy.  Probably the best part is the humor; everything from the predatory rotisserie chickens to the father's eyebrows are all original humor.

In isolation from the outside world, the now economically depressed island struggles to stay afloat, and finds themselves relying on the only thing they have (sardines) to survive.Inventor Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), along with his talking monkey colleague Steve (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) hope to change the sardine-based world around them with an invention unlike any the world has known: a nanotechnology converter capable of rearranging water molecules into any kind of food imaginable.A first for poor Flint, this device actually seems to work.  The trouble is that when it accidentally gets rocketed into the stratosphere in the presence of former nerd turned news-reporter hottie Sam Sparks (voiced by Anna Faris), the very weather itself is suddenly quite unstable!Before long everything from burger and hot dogs drizzle to pancake downpours and ice cream snowstorms begin to make their way from the rolling purple clouds. Flint goes from outcast to local hero in one fell swoop, but the fame pales in comparison to all he really seeks: the respect of his gruff tackle shop owning, unibrow sporting dad (James Caan).The film works on just about every conceivable level: Fantastic visuals with unrivaled lighting effects mean the kiddies will be glued to the flat screen, an intelligent screenplay by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller that offers exceptional humor that even adults can enjoy, and a cast that never misses a beat (Bruce Campbell as Mayor Shelbourne, Mr. T as Officer Deveraux, and ""Baby"" Brent done by the infectious Andy Samberg), you come away with a project that gives absolutely nothing up to Pixar or DreamWorks.Pacing is very brisk, even for a movie primarily targeted at children and wastes very little time setting things up.  Best of all it manages to do something all animated features aspire toward but few achieve: It establishes characters that are easy to care about!Couple this to the fact that there are lessons scattered about on many levels that will reveal themselves as the viewer matures mentally and the lasting appeal of having this one in your collection becomes clear.I was able to enjoy this one in a room full of individuals ranging from preschool age to retirement and just about all intervals in between and can attest to the fact that all involved were intensely connected and frequently laughed out loud at the various levels of humor contained within.In all, this is a highly recommended animated feature that literally offers up something for nearly everyone.  Sony Imageworks has yet to establish a presence that threatens the big boys of the industry but Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is certainly not to blame for that reality.  In fact, I could go as far as to say that it does an incredible job at narrowing the gap.",5,Bright with a Chance of Excellence,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,3219,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'ever', 'encountered', 'Judi', 'Ron', 'Barrett', '1978', 'children', 'book', 'inspired', 'film', 'can', 'attest', 'fact', 'CG-animated', 'masterpiece', 'right', 'notes', 'when', 'competing', 'arena', 'established', 'companies', 'Pixar', 'DreamWorks.Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'set', 'island', 'Swallow', 'Falls', 'small', 'community', 'economy', 'fueled', 'sardine', 'industry', 'isolation', 'outside', 'world', 'now', 'economically', 'depressed', 'island', 'stay', 'afloat', 'relying', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'sardines', 'survive.Inventor', 'Flint', 'Lockwood', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'talking', 'monkey', 'colleague', 'Steve', 'voiced', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'hope', 'change', 'sardine-based', 'world', 'invention', 'world', 'known', 'nanotechnology', 'converter', 'capable', 'rearranging', 'water', 'molecules', 'kind', 'food', 'imaginable.A', 'first', 'poor', 'Flint', 'device', 'actually', 'work', 'trouble', 'when', 'accidentally', 'rocketed', 'stratosphere', 'presence', 'former', 'nerd', 'turned', 'news-reporter', 'hottie', 'Sam', 'Sparks', 'voiced', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'very', 'weather', 'suddenly', 'quite', 'unstable', 'long', 'everything', 'burger', 'hot', 'dogs', 'drizzle', 'pancake', 'downpours', 'ice', 'cream', 'begin', 'make', 'way', 'rolling', 'purple', 'clouds', 'Flint', 'outcast', 'local', 'hero', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop', 'fame', 'comparison', 'really', 'respect', 'gruff', 'tackle', 'shop', 'owning', 'unibrow', 'sporting', 'dad', 'James', 'Caan', '.The', 'film', 'works', 'just', 'conceivable', 'level', 'Fantastic', 'visuals', 'unrivaled', 'lighting', 'effects', 'mean', 'kiddies', 'will', 'be', 'glued', 'flat', 'screen', 'intelligent', 'screenplay', 'Phil', 'Lord', 'Christopher', 'Miller', 'exceptional', 'humor', 'even', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'cast', 'never', 'beat', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Mayor', 'Shelbourne', 'Mr.', 'T', 'Officer', 'Deveraux', 'Baby', 'Brent', 'done', 'infectious', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'come', 'away', 'project', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'up', 'Pixar', 'DreamWorks.Pacing', 'very', 'brisk', 'even', 'movie', 'primarily', 'targeted', 'children', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'setting', 'things', 'up', 'Best', 'do', 'something', 'all', 'animated', 'features', 'aspire', 'few', 'achieve', 'characters', 'are', 'easy', 'care', 'Couple', 'fact', 'are', 'lessons', 'scattered', 'many', 'levels', 'will', 'reveal', 'viewer', 'mentally', 'lasting', 'appeal', 'having', 'one', 'collection', 'clear.I', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'one', 'room', 'full', 'individuals', 'ranging', 'preschool', 'age', 'retirement', 'just', 'intervals', 'can', 'attest', 'fact', 'involved', 'were', 'intensely', 'connected', 'frequently', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'various', 'levels', 'humor', 'contained', 'highly', 'recommended', 'animated', 'feature', 'literally', 'up', 'something', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'Sony', 'Imageworks', 'yet', 'establish', 'presence', 'big', 'boys', 'industry', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'certainly', 'not', 'blame', 'reality', 'fact', 'could', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'incredible', 'job', 'narrowing', 'gap']",N/A

Amazingly his invention worked, and he just needed more power to make it go. Wow, I must say how amazing this invention of his works, it could end world hunger. And even with a movie like this of turning water into food, you never know as someday, somebody just might take it one step ahead, and make it into a reality. And they can say that they got inspired by the movie. I think that the sequel to this story is when Flint invents a machine to make it rain pickles. Yeah the whole town of chew and swallow covered in pickles, what fun is that, everyone eating nothing but pickles?! You figure with all the giant food, since it was made of water, then Flint could've changed it back into water. And just call this giant food frenzy a historical food event.

The whole process takes about six hours to get through everything so probably a decent investment if you are sitting on the fence about cost.The picture quality is flawless but admittedly you might have to set your color saturation/temp a little differently as the spectrum is very heavy towards the reds, oranges and purples (Up had a certain clarity definition for tons of colors, this is more a bright/soft saturation). The DTS sounded great and all of the channels got used extensively, reference the mayor's scene where he appears on each side of our main character several times in the lab - plus plenty of others. The supplements are both fun and informative and include:* Splat Mode. Turning this option on allows you to watch the film while throwing varities of food onto the characters in the film. Both of my kids had fun doing this and lasted for a few scenes before they were ready for the next option.* Food Fight game. This was actually enjoyable for me too - the kids each took turns and found themselves ready to achieve higher scores. Very similar to the old Centipede game as you try to shoot the food before it enters the machine, followed by a higher level where a horde of gummy bears descend toward your flying car.* Commentary with the makers and Hader. The filmmakers are young and they really should stay behind the camera as their parts in the supplements were either corny or dry. But Hader adds a refreshing touch.* Making of, 10:50 minutes. Almost a skipper as this one centers on the two makers showing their comic schtick in the kitchen, supplemented with some snippets about logistics, unfunny.* Voices of, 11:50 minutes. Worth the watch and the best supplement for behind the scenes. Farris, Mr. T and Hader give some great interviews and insight.* Extended Scenes, 2 @ 2:35 minutes. 1 in HD and 1 in lowdef. Added some cool info to the battle scene in the lab.* Early Development scenes, 2 @ 5:39 minutes. The whole storyboard thing, skipper unless you are into it.* Progression reels, 5 @ 7:51 minutes. Much more informative on the making of process/colorization. I would say watch this over the other making of - hands down.* Cosgrove Sunshine Video. My daughter loves iCarly so we had to watch every option here. You can watch the video by itself or watch with a sing-along option, we did both. There is a brief making-of regarding the video which only had a couple brief interview snippets with Ms. Cosgrove but you know the story if you have a young daughter - we had to watch it twice.* Make it Rain Food. A brief ad plug for helping the hungry.* BD Live. Had a fair amount of material that is accessible via theLabyrinth [Blu-ray] andThe Dark Crystal [Blu-ray] products, including another Jim Henson interview and the extra features from those BDs.DISC 2: TheCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (Single-Disc Edition)item - and I verified everything is there as to avoid the mistake I made with theUp (4 Disc Combo Pack with Digital Copy and DVD) [Blu-ray] version. So all subs, languages and features are identical.The movie plays great in the store and that Mr. T rendition of ""Flintlock Wood"" has overtaken ""squirrel"" (from Up) as the go-to catchphrase amongst the young ones.

1242448,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001UV4XXS,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[9, 12]","Very loosely based on the acclaimed children's book of the same name, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs actually succeeds with the modernization and embellished plot. Perhaps diehard fans of the original material will nitpick the expanded mythos, but the film adaptation offers a hearty mix of humor that will appeal to nearly every age group. A wide range and variety of humor can be found within, from the childish and absurd to the clever and insightful; even self-referential mockery and fat jokes make an appearance. Beneath all the layers of food and fun exists a story of finding love and acceptance, though the impressive visuals and wild laughs leave little room for such morals. And between the man-eating roast chicken and the living gummy bears, one wouldn't expect it anyway.Ever since he was a child, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) has dreamed of becoming a great scientist whose inventions would change the world. When he constructs a synthesizer that can change water into food his dream comes true, and as the sky rains down cheeseburgers, pizza, ice cream, and more, Flint finally achieves the adoration and respect he's always desired. But when the greedy town mayor demands an ever-increasing assortment of cuisine, the machine overloads, bringing down mountains of meatballs and cyclones of pasta. Now it's up to Flint, his pet monkey, and nerdy weather girl Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) to save the world from certain extinction by eatables.The 3D effects being slapped onto almost every computer animated film to hit theaters rarely does anything to improve the imaginative visuals. While there are certainly opportunities for random objects to pierce the third dimension and tantalize the audience, ""Cloudy"" never flaunts the awesomeness of the gimmick. One of the most impressive moments involves a massive food avalanche (foodalanche) that looks amazing either way.The incredibly obese mayor (Bruce Campbell) provides many of the most hilarious visual gags along with ""sentient"" food, the pessimistic dad unloads the downer realism and the deeper emotional revelations, the elderly and their stereotypical inadequacies with technology is mocked, we're lectured about embracing inner ugliness and supposedly unattractive intelligence, and picking up girls has never been easier than building an enormous, perfectly sculpted, fully furnished Jell-O mansion. Good to know.Although it's based on the famous children's book, many of the beefed up ideas in the film are so ludicrous that they'd never normally work. But with a wildly creative, inventive approach to the environments, character designs and animation, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs pulls it off. Full of eye-rolling puns, wacky inventions (including the always-necessary mouth funnels) and unbelievable solutions, it's a deliciously zany, adventurous treat.- The Massie Twins",4,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1253232000,"09 18, 2009",2009,2856,"['Very', 'loosely', 'based', 'acclaimed', 'children', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'actually', 'modernization', 'embellished', 'plot', 'Perhaps', 'diehard', 'fans', 'original', 'material', 'will', 'nitpick', 'expanded', 'mythos', 'film', 'adaptation', 'hearty', 'mix', 'humor', 'will', 'appeal', 'nearly', 'age', 'group', 'wide', 'range', 'variety', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'childish', 'absurd', 'clever', 'insightful', 'even', 'self-referential', 'mockery', 'fat', 'jokes', 'make', 'appearance', 'layers', 'food', 'fun', 'story', 'finding', 'love', 'acceptance', 'impressive', 'visuals', 'wild', 'laughs', 'leave', 'little', 'room', 'such', 'morals', 'man-eating', 'roast', 'chicken', 'living', 'gummy', 'bears', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anyway.Ever', 'was', 'child', 'Flint', 'Lockwood', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'dreamed', 'becoming', 'great', 'scientist', 'inventions', 'would', 'change', 'world', 'When', 'synthesizer', 'can', 'change', 'water', 'food', 'dream', 'true', 'sky', 'down', 'cheeseburgers', 'pizza', 'ice', 'cream', 'more', 'Flint', 'finally', 'adoration', 'respect', 'always', 'desired', 'when', 'greedy', 'town', 'mayor', 'ever-increasing', 'assortment', 'cuisine', 'machine', 'overloads', 'bringing', 'down', 'mountains', 'meatballs', 'cyclones', 'pasta', 'Now', 'up', 'Flint', 'pet', 'monkey', 'nerdy', 'weather', 'girl', 'Sam', 'Sparks', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'save', 'world', 'certain', 'extinction', '3D', 'effects', 'being', 'slapped', 'almost', 'computer', 'animated', 'film', 'hit', 'theaters', 'rarely', 'anything', 'improve', 'imaginative', 'visuals', 'are', 'certainly', 'opportunities', 'random', 'objects', 'pierce', 'third', 'dimension', 'tantalize', 'audience', 'Cloudy', 'never', 'awesomeness', 'gimmick', 'One', 'most', 'impressive', 'moments', 'massive', 'food', 'avalanche', 'foodalanche', 'amazing', 'way.The', 'incredibly', 'obese', 'mayor', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'many', 'most', 'hilarious', 'visual', 'gags', 'sentient', 'food', 'pessimistic', 'dad', 'downer', 'realism', 'deeper', 'emotional', 'revelations', 'elderly', 'stereotypical', 'inadequacies', 'technology', 'mocked', ""'re"", 'lectured', 'embracing', 'inner', 'ugliness', 'supposedly', 'unattractive', 'intelligence', 'picking', 'up', 'girls', 'never', 'been', 'easier', 'building', 'enormous', 'perfectly', 'sculpted', 'fully', 'furnished', 'Jell-O', 'mansion', 'Good', 'know.Although', 'based', 'famous', 'children', 'book', 'many', 'beefed', 'up', 'ideas', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'ludicrous', ""'d"", 'never', 'normally', 'work', 'wildly', 'creative', 'inventive', 'approach', 'environments', 'character', 'designs', 'animation', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'off', 'Full', 'eye-rolling', 'puns', 'wacky', 'inventions', 'including', 'always-necessary', 'mouth', 'funnels', 'unbelievable', 'solutions', 'deliciously', 'zany', 'adventurous', 'treat.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

1242461,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001UV4XXS,Z Hayes,"[2, 3]","The following review is of the movie (and a review of the DVD and its features will follow after it has been released):My husband and I took our almost 5-year-old to watch this at the dollar cinema this afternoon, and all three of us were entertained. My daughter seemed taken by the visual spectacle of the movie - with all the raining food, etc. I, on the other hand, loved the special effects, the vivid colors and fun animation, and the deeper messages of indulging in excesses. The movie itself is based (very loosely) on a well-known children's book of the same name. In the movie version, the story focuses on a small island in the Atlantic where the main industry is fishing and canning sardines. Here lives a young boy named Flint who loves to invent the quirkiest gadgets, including 'spray-on' shoes that will not come off! He becomes the butt of his clasmates' jokes, and the only ones who encourage him are his parents (well, mom more than dad). As Flint grows up (voiced by Bill Hader of SNL), he tries to come up with successful inventions to impress his quiet widowed dad, Tim (voiced by James Caan), who would prefer that Flint help him in his bait and tackle store. The island is also in serious danger of going broke with a failing sardine industry. When Flint finally invents something that actually works - a machine that can convert water into food, the greedy and gluttonous mayor (Bruce Campbell) sees this a chance to revitalize the island, hoping to turn it into a major tourist destination where tourists can gorge themselves on food falling out of the sky. There's also a 'love' interest for Flint in the form of science nerd turned weather girl Sam (Anna Faris) and Flint's little sidekick monkey Steve (Neil Patrick Harris).The demands placed on the machine however,get more excessive over time, with predictably disastrous consequences.Young children will probably like all the vivid colors, and the visual spectacle of watching food rain down from the sky - cheeseburgers, hotdogs, ice cream everywhere. But, the effects are truly awe-inducing that even adults will delight in it - a spaghetti tornado, jumbo-sized food raining down on people, etc. The humor is appropriate for children without being too juvenile for adult tastes. I also liked the beautiful way the blossoming relationship between Flint and Sam was explored - there's a jello-inspired scene which is truly captivating. The relationship between Flint and his dad is also heartfelt without being overly sappy. There are some deeper messages here such as the dangers of excesses - with reference to food (the mayor's gluttony being a good example), how consumers can be easily manipulated ( bigger portions=better). On the whole - this is a wonderful, visually compelling movie with lovable characters and a unique plot.",4,A fun film for kids and with some deeper messages better appreciated by adults,1261094400,"12 18, 2009",2009,2816,"['following', 'review', 'movie', 'review', 'DVD', 'features', 'will', 'follow', 'been', 'released', 'husband', 'took', 'almost', '5-year-old', 'watch', 'dollar', 'cinema', 'afternoon', 'three', 'were', 'entertained', 'daughter', 'seemed', 'taken', 'visual', 'spectacle', 'movie', 'raining', 'food', 'etc', 'other', 'hand', 'loved', 'special', 'effects', 'vivid', 'colors', 'fun', 'animation', 'deeper', 'messages', 'indulging', 'excesses', 'movie', 'based', 'very', 'loosely', 'well-known', 'children', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'version', 'story', 'small', 'island', 'Atlantic', 'where', 'main', 'industry', 'fishing', 'canning', 'sardines', 'Here', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Flint', 'who', 'invent', 'quirkiest', 'gadgets', 'including', ""'spray-on"", 'shoes', 'will', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'butt', 'clasmates', 'jokes', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'encourage', 'are', 'parents', 'well', 'more', 'dad', 'Flint', 'up', 'voiced', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'SNL', 'come', 'up', 'successful', 'inventions', 'impress', 'quiet', 'widowed', 'dad', 'Tim', 'voiced', 'James', 'Caan', 'who', 'would', 'prefer', 'Flint', 'help', 'bait', 'tackle', 'store', 'island', 'also', 'serious', 'danger', 'going', 'broke', 'failing', 'sardine', 'industry', 'When', 'Flint', 'finally', 'something', 'actually', 'machine', 'can', 'convert', 'water', 'food', 'greedy', 'gluttonous', 'mayor', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'chance', 'revitalize', 'island', 'hoping', 'turn', 'major', 'tourist', 'destination', 'where', 'tourists', 'can', 'gorge', 'food', 'falling', 'sky', 'also', ""'love"", 'interest', 'Flint', 'form', 'science', 'nerd', 'turned', 'weather', 'girl', 'Sam', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Flint', 'little', 'sidekick', 'monkey', 'Steve', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', '.The', 'demands', 'placed', 'machine', 'however', 'get', 'more', 'excessive', 'time', 'predictably', 'disastrous', 'consequences.Young', 'children', 'will', 'probably', 'vivid', 'colors', 'visual', 'spectacle', 'watching', 'food', 'rain', 'sky', 'cheeseburgers', 'hotdogs', 'ice', 'cream', 'everywhere', 'effects', 'are', 'truly', 'awe-inducing', 'even', 'adults', 'will', 'delight', 'spaghetti', 'tornado', 'jumbo-sized', 'food', 'raining', 'down', 'people', 'etc', 'humor', 'appropriate', 'children', 'being', 'too', 'juvenile', 'adult', 'tastes', 'also', 'liked', 'beautiful', 'way', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'Flint', 'Sam', 'was', 'explored', 'jello-inspired', 'scene', 'truly', 'captivating', 'relationship', 'Flint', 'dad', 'also', 'heartfelt', 'being', 'overly', 'sappy', 'are', 'deeper', 'messages', 'here', 'such', 'dangers', 'excesses', 'reference', 'food', 'mayor', 'gluttony', 'being', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'consumers', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'bigger', 'portions=better', 'whole', 'wonderful', 'visually', 'compelling', 'movie', 'lovable', 'characters', 'unique', 'plot']",N/A
