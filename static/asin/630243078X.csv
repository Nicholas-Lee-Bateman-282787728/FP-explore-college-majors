312504,A2IVCG4IILTY6O,630243078X,"abt1950 ""abt1950""","[4, 5]","I have a hard time liking this movie because it made such a travesty of Susan Isaacs' book. The book, as originally written, was a classic ugly duckling-to-swan story set in New York, Washington, and Germany during World War II. Linda Voss, the character played by Melanie Griffith, was a working class girl in love with and eventually married to her gorgeous cad of a boss.  She had the brains; he had the social cachet.  They move to Washington, she gets a job as secretary to a top intelligence agent (played by Michael Douglas), the marriage founders, and in despair she signs up as an undercover agent. The rest of the movie follows the book's plot fairly closely, although the Douglas character does NOT figure in as a romantic interest until the very end.  In the book, he's Linda's unexpected reward--pure gold where her husband was only gold-plated.  The movie, by simplifying the story, guts its emotional core and turns a contemporary fairy tale into your basic trite Hollywood production--glitzy but without a heart.That said, there are some strong performances in the movie.  Douglas's stiffness makes much more sense in the context of the book, but doesn't work in the movie as filmed.  Griffith is Griffith--you either love her or hate her.  Liam Neeson is good, as is Joely Richardson (although the ""Mein Gott, you have guts"" line is a bit over the top).  There are some suspenseful moments in the scenes in Nazi Germany.  At times the movie's enjoyable, but overall, it disappoints.",2,Rips the emotional guts from the book,1086998400,"06 12, 2004",2004,1499,"['have', 'hard', 'time', 'liking', 'movie', 'made', 'travesty', 'Susan', 'Isaacs', 'book', 'book', 'originally', 'written', 'was', 'classic', 'ugly', 'duckling-to-swan', 'story', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'Washington', 'Germany', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Linda', 'Voss', 'character', 'played', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'was', 'working', 'class', 'girl', 'love', 'eventually', 'married', 'gorgeous', 'cad', 'boss', 'had', 'brains', 'had', 'social', 'cachet', 'move', 'Washington', 'job', 'secretary', 'top', 'intelligence', 'agent', 'played', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'marriage', 'founders', 'despair', 'signs', 'up', 'undercover', 'agent', 'rest', 'movie', 'book', 'plot', 'fairly', 'closely', 'Douglas', 'character', 'NOT', 'figure', 'romantic', 'interest', 'very', 'end', 'book', 'Linda', 'unexpected', 'reward', 'pure', 'gold', 'where', 'husband', 'was', 'only', 'gold-plated', 'movie', 'simplifying', 'story', 'emotional', 'core', 'contemporary', 'fairy', 'tale', 'basic', 'trite', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'glitzy', 'heart.That', 'said', 'are', 'strong', 'performances', 'movie', 'Douglas', 'stiffness', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'context', 'book', ""n't"", 'work', 'movie', 'filmed', 'Griffith', 'Griffith', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'good', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'Mein', 'Gott', 'have', 'guts', 'line', 'bit', 'top', 'are', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'scenes', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'times', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'overall']",Shining Through VHS

It is the story of how a secretary ends up volunteering to go undercover in Berlin in the early days of WWII in order to try to get some important documents.

In addition to the espionage aspect, the heroine is also part Jewish which adds another dimension to the movie as she has some relatives in hiding in Berlin. The story is interesting enough to be entertaining. The only part I am somewhat dubious about is the casting for the lead role. Melanie Griffith doesn't seem that convincing.

Shining Through is based on the novel by Susan Issacs and is a melodrama at it's core - but a damn fine one.  Lost among the hoopla over the ""other"" Michael Douglas film that year (""Basic Instinct"") Shining Through never got the cred it deserved as a film made in the classic Hollywood style.The plot is relatively simple, for a film about espoinage : Melanie Griffith, a Jewish secretary, is hired by Michael Douglas for normal secretarial work, and eventually learns that her boss moonlights as a ranking member of the US military.  Through a series of cleverly timed events, she is drawn into the world of intelligence and becomes a Nazi Germany spy herself.All of the actors were at their prime when making this film - Natasha Richardson and Liam Neeson join the picture part way through and do an excellent job, as do the leads.  Although at it's core it's really a love story, there is enough action and tension to entertain anyone who can suspend the disbelief that Melanie Griffith could become an international spy.If I make it sound like ""Alias"", it's not - it's just a wonderfully crafted film that is a worthy addition to any collection, especially anyone who is a fan of classic Hollywood melodramas.

But it was perhaps the presence of Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith as the leads that led me to think that it was just some lame action adventure that Hollywood sometimes has a tendency to unload on us.Boy was I wrong!My TiVo picked up the show as a suggestion when it played on HBO and as I sat down to watch it I realized that this movie was more drama than action and more suspense than adventure. A true revelation and factors that really heightened the quality and provided compulsive viewing for the next two hours-plus.The story centers around a bilingual (English and German) secretary Linda Voss that begins to work for a rather shadowy businessman Ed Leland (played by Douglas) at the outbreak of World War II in Europe. Soon she suspects he is a spy and after taking down a particularly strange message she confronts her boss with her suspicions.Fast forward and upon America's entrance into the conflict Ed reveals himself to be an operative for OSS (the precursor to today's CIA) and an Army officer to-boot.With her knowledge of German and highly keen observation skills Linda is soon attending top secret OSS meetings and (against Ed's better judgement) sent into Germany to steal secret plans for the V-1 and V-2 rockets.What follows is a thoroughly entertaining story that shows a truly frightening and at points terrifying depiction of life in Nazi Germany that includes some top calibre acting talent in the lead roles. In addition to Douglas and Griffith we also have Liam Neeson as a German officer, Jeoly Richardson as a German civilian and John Gielgud as an old spymaster. All give tour-de-force performances and although sometimes the plot can be somewhat predictable (we suspect early on the true allegiances of one of the three supporting characters may not be what they seem to be) but it is always compelling and wonderful entertainment.The DVD is available in widescreen (always a plus) and although its rather light on special features it is available for under $10.Highly recommended.",5,A true revelation---highly recommended,1126224000,"09 9, 2005",2005,2391,"['be', 'honest', 'am', 'surprised', 'have', 'not', 'managed', 'see', 'movie', 'before', 'now', 'considering', 'weakness', 'espionage', 'movies', 'specifically', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'spy', 'pictures', 'list', 'WHERE', 'EAGLES', 'DARE', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'NEVER', 'WAS', 'favorite', '100', 'movies', '.I', 'did', 'see', 'parts', 'movie', 'before', 'played', 'background', 'house', 'party', 'attended', 'over', 'decade', 'was', 'perhaps', 'presence', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'leads', 'led', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'lame', 'action', 'adventure', 'Hollywood', 'sometimes', 'tendency', 'unload', 'us.Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'TiVo', 'picked', 'up', 'show', 'suggestion', 'when', 'played', 'HBO', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'realized', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'drama', 'action', 'more', 'suspense', 'adventure', 'true', 'revelation', 'factors', 'really', 'heightened', 'quality', 'provided', 'compulsive', 'viewing', 'next', 'two', 'hours-plus.The', 'story', 'centers', 'bilingual', 'English', 'German', 'secretary', 'Linda', 'Voss', 'work', 'rather', 'shadowy', 'businessman', 'Ed', 'Leland', 'played', 'Douglas', 'outbreak', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Europe', 'Soon', 'spy', 'taking', 'down', 'particularly', 'strange', 'message', 'boss', 'suspicions.Fast', 'forward', 'America', 'entrance', 'conflict', 'Ed', 'be', 'operative', 'OSS', 'precursor', 'today', 'CIA', 'Army', 'officer', 'to-boot.With', 'knowledge', 'German', 'highly', 'keen', 'observation', 'skills', 'Linda', 'soon', 'attending', 'top', 'secret', 'OSS', 'meetings', 'Ed', 'better', 'judgement', 'sent', 'Germany', 'steal', 'secret', 'plans', 'V-1', 'V-2', 'rockets.What', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'story', 'truly', 'frightening', 'points', 'terrifying', 'depiction', 'life', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'top', 'calibre', 'acting', 'talent', 'lead', 'roles', 'addition', 'Douglas', 'Griffith', 'also', 'have', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'German', 'officer', 'Jeoly', 'Richardson', 'German', 'civilian', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'old', 'spymaster', 'give', 'tour-de-force', 'performances', 'sometimes', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'suspect', 'early', 'true', 'allegiances', 'one', 'three', 'supporting', 'characters', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'always', 'compelling', 'wonderful', 'entertainment.The', 'DVD', 'available', 'widescreen', 'always', 'plus', 'rather', 'light', 'special', 'features', 'available', '10.Highly', 'recommended']",Shining Through VHS

Based on their assessment that was impetus for me to avoid the flick.  When I asked my wife what her favorite movie of all time she told me it was ""Shining Through"".  This caused me to scratch my head.  Now I had to check out the flick that Siskel and Ebert dismissed as dreck but my wife thought was pure gold.  My unbiased opinion is...not bad but not great.  My enjoyment depends on not treating it seriously as World War II fare but as pure popcorn.

There were so many different turns, between the romance and the WWII espionage aspect of the movie.  Subtle humor and wonderful performances.Melanie Griffith plays Linda, a young woman born to immigrants: a Jewish, German father and an Irish mother.  She has been raised to speak both German and English. Her ability to speak German with fluency allows her to become a secretary for Ed Leland (Michael Douglas), a spy. Her sharp eye for details frustrates Ed to no end as she points out that she would make a better spy than he does.  Stubborn to a fault, she convinces Ed to allow her into Germany so that she can spy on high-ranking Nazi officials ... undercover as a German domestic.  Through a series of turns, she is fired from one job but is quickly re-hired by another Nazi officer (Liam Neeson), who trusts her as a nanny to watch his children.  Linda struggles to maintain her cover and to try to save her cousins -- Jews who are struggling to hide in Berlin.  Linda is tutored in espionage by the legendary agent Sunflower (John Gielgud), a German spying for the Americans.Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith have great chemistry in this movie.  Melanie Griffith speaks German with such a convincing accent she is to be commended.  Liam Neeson and John Gielgud add to the film nicely.

She knows I love movies and write reviews and wants to hear my opinion about this supposedly exciting, suspenseful, romantic movie.I hoped for the best but was ready to possibly be disappointed just in case. I wasn't ready for this level of disappointment. I could barely get through the first half of it. It is so poorly written, acted, and directed: The bad movie hat trick.It's supposed to be a drama but it is utterly unbelievable to the point of laughter. It's like it was written by a teenage girl with ADD. It has a cliche-ridden and unnecessary narration read by Griffith - who has the voice of an 8-year-old. She falls in love with Douglas for NO OTHER reason except that he's the male lead. He says nothing positive to her for 99% of the movie. He doesn't say much at all, in fact. He never shows any emotion at all except frustration and discomfort. He gets frustrated with her job interview, hires her as his secretary anyway, gets frustrated when she sniffs him out as a spy, then they are suddenly having sex, with no intervening relationship development apart from a discussion of Charlie Chaplin - but the narration says they are lovers, so they must be!And (Mary Sue Alert) suddenly the heroine is solving all the intel problems of the war because she learned about spying from watching a lot of Hollywood movies. And since she speaks German and makes great strudel, she is sent to Germany as a spy - never mind that she sounds like an 8-year-old from New York.I am trying to find SOMETHING positive to say about this movie. Griffith's character has a few great lines in the first act that establish her as a smart, strong woman. One wishes the rest of the script were as quick-witted. It's also set during the 1940s and the costumes and hair are extremely authentic. And Michael Kamen's score is nice, if not one of his best.

Melanie Griffin and Michael Douglas are the primary actors, of course, with great supporting actors/actresses.  Melanie is half Jewish, living in Queens, in search of a job. While looking for a secretary job, she gets the not-good-enough treatment because she's not from Vassar. Things change quickly, when they hear her speaking German to a cleaning lady.  Just so happens that the head honcho (Michael) needs an interpreter secretary cause he can't speak German. Turns out old Michael is a secret spy for the USA and makes trips back and forth to Germany and needs letters translated and such.When one of the other spies gets whacked by the Nazis, Melanie decides she wants to go into the spy thing for the US, so she can check out her Jewish relatives, last seen in Berlin, and maybe get them to safety in the US, somehow.  She manages to even mix in with the German elite.  Liam Neeson is also great as a high-ranking German officer.  And John Gielgud is a spy too.  As always, he is outstanding in everything.There are great plots, characters, twists and turns, and lots of suspense.  It's a spy thing, run-and-hide from the Nazi's (who are snoopy little suckers), get the secrets, and get out alive type movie.  It's also a love story, cause Melanie falls in love with old Michael along the way and he acts like the coldest mackarel in town.

The opening scene shows a older Linda Voss (Melanie Griffith) giving a WWII Spy story to the BBC.  The film pans back to a young Linda growing up in New York with a German Jewish father (who teaches her the language) and an Irish mother.  Linda uses her smarts to get a job as secretary in 1940 New York City.  She is savvy and soon suspects her boss (Michael Douglas) is a spy.  When America enters WWII, his key contact and operative in Berlin is killed.  Linda has Jewish relatives in Germany she wants to help, and also feels the need to be part of finding information on the German bomb research site.  It is a new technology that puts bombs on rockets, and the USA wants it destroyed before it is put into operation.  Linda convinces her boss she can help fill the position, although he is very worried the Germans will find out about her Jewish background.  She begs him to let her go undercover and become a secret agent. This was the one part where I smiled - Linda bakes a strudel to show her boss the German's will love her cooking and accept her as a fantastic cook.

Never mind the side-splitting performance Melanie Griffith delivers, just try and figure out why she's hiding microfilm in frozen herring that is being shipped from Berlin (A land-locked city) to Norway (Fishing capital of Europe). And then, when she drops the microfilm right in front of a Gestopo agent, she simply covers it with her foot until he loses interest and goes away! By this time tears were running down my cheek!And then there's unilingual Michael Douglas racing to her rescue, traveling through Nazi Germany with a bandaid around his neck and a sign that reads, ""Wounded soldier, can't speak"". I guess that if they asked him to write something in German he could have just cramped up and shrugged. But fear not, he emegres in the end, none the worse for wear, even after being shot in the back, repeatedly, at point blank range with a German Mauser.It just gets better and better.

This is about ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and how they react to those circumstances -  and to each other. Melanie Griffith does a credible job as Linda Voss,  although it is obvious she had to take a crash course in German before the  filming started.  (The actor who played Ed Leland's assistant had a much  more authentic accent, and obviously knows German.)  Michael Douglas's  performance was a little stiff, but his persona works well with Griffith's,  and together they make the storyline work.  All the other lead actors gave  what I thought were authentic and well-done performances. The set designs  were excellent - especially Ed's apartment in New York and Margerete's  apartment in Berlin.  They were SO 1930's!  Kudos to the set designers who  did their research well. The storyline is a little slow in places, but the  viewer hangs on because you don't know what is going to happen next.  The  plot could have gone in several different directions, so the viewer stays  with the story to find out.  And, although this film is based on Susan  Isaacs' novel, I think it is safe to say that something along this line  probably happened during World War II.  As I said earlier, it was about  ordinary people in very extraordinary circumstances.
