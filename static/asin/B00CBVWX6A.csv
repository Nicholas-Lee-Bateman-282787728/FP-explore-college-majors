This is an amazing movie, but it's really a semi-romantic drama and thriller, that happens to be set in a world with zombies.  This is NOT a MOVIE about ZOMBIES!  They are anecdotal to the plot. It is about how far people go when the situation demands it, how far they go when pushed, and really about how much more horrible people can be than the horrors around them.  DON'T BELIEVE THE COVER ART, this is not your average zombie movie!  What it is, is a great, heart-wrenching drama character study.  With the ever-present threat of zombies.  You can read my full review here if you want more detail: [...] but in the mean time, this is an amazingly well made, well acted drama from some talented filmmakers and worth your time (as long as you're not looking for boobs/gore/head crushings/zombie hoards... there are a ton of other movies with similar cover art that will provide that.)",5,"Don't Believe the Cover Art, this is a Drama!!!",1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,1000,"['was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'movie', 'back', '2012', 'review', 'website', 'back', 'got', 'distribution', 'amazing', 'movie', 'really', 'semi-romantic', 'drama', 'thriller', 'be', 'set', 'world', 'zombies', 'NOT', 'MOVIE', 'ZOMBIES', 'are', 'anecdotal', 'plot', 'how', 'far', 'people', 'go', 'when', 'situation', 'how', 'far', 'go', 'when', 'pushed', 'really', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'horrible', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'horrors', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'BELIEVE', 'THE', 'COVER', 'ART', 'not', 'average', 'zombie', 'movie', 'What', 'great', 'heart-wrenching', 'drama', 'character', 'study', 'ever-present', 'threat', 'zombies', 'can', 'read', 'full', 'review', 'here', 'want', 'more', 'detail', '[', ']', 'mean', 'time', 'amazingly', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'acted', 'drama', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'worth', 'time', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'not', 'looking', 'boobs/gore/head', 'crushings/zombie', 'hoards', 'are', 'ton', 'other', 'movies', 'similar', 'cover', 'art', 'will', 'provide']",Dead Weight
1645674,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B00CBVWX6A,DVD Verdict,"[4, 5]","Post-apocalyptic movies and zombies have always gone hand-in-hand. The apocalypse doesn't necessarily imply zombies, but there's always an element of it there when you assume the dead are rising from their graves. First time writer/directors Adam Bartlett and John Pata do something interesting with that concept, though, by assuming zombies (or infected, as they're called here) but never showing them and, instead, making the entire conflict exist between the survivors. It's not the first time such a thing's been done, but Dead Weight does a pretty good job with the concept.A plague has turned humanity against itself and the few survivors must deal with both the infected and the other survivors, who are now capable of anything. As we watch Charlie (Joe Belknap) walk the road with four friends toward a small Wisconsin town, we see the rise and tragic fall of his relationship with Samantha (Mary Lindberg), the woman he's travelling to meet. When they finally reunite, they both realize that the choices they've made has rendered a reconciliation impossible.On a certain level, Dead Weight resembles a stand-alone issue of The Walking Dead, one in which we get all new characters in a familiar situation just to see how fresh personalities react to it. In this case, though, it would be an issue written by somebody other than Robert Kirkland because even though Bartlett and Pata show some writing and directing skill in their debut, the dialog and situation just don't carry the weight of the comic.Mostly, that's because they try to make the romance between Charlie and Samantha as important as the rest of the story. That's certainly a conscious choice that just doesn't work as well as they wanted it to. It's told through flashbacks and out of order in a way that is stylistically interesting, but not terribly effective and takes away from the suspense.To their credit, though, Belknap and Linberg do quite well in their respective debuts. They have a certain amount of tense chemistry between them and a couple of the more emotional scenes are really effective, but seem like they belong in another film. The rest of the cast, of varying levels of experience, are all pretty good, but the nature of the story makes so many characters necessary that none of them get any time to breathe.Bartlett and Pata show a fair bit of style in Dead Weight, as well. The main plot is filmed almost without color, with only the faintest blues and greys on screen, while the flashbacks are all shot brightly, with modern saturated tones. It's a cheap film, of course, but they make it work with the resources they have. And maybe it doesn't work as well as it could, but it is a worthy first effort that makes me excited for the future.Dead Weight arrives from Horizon Movies on a DVD that is much stronger than movies like this would normally get. The 1.78:1 anamorphic image isn't anything particularly special, but it still looks pretty strong. It's sharp, with nice bright colors during the flashback sequences and good black levels in the dark rest of the film. Sound is good as well, with both surround and stereo sound and, though they sound pretty much identical, it's clear and sharp throughout. I suppose the surround track has a little bit of action in the rear channels, but it's not much to account for.Extra features start with two audio commentaries. The first, with writer/directors Bartlett and Pata and if there's one thing you can't accuse them of lacking, it's enthusiasm. They talk animatedly about all aspects of the film, maybe a little too much so, but hey, it's their first film, so whatever. More conventional is the actors' commentary with Belknap and Lindberg, who go over much of the same material. It's interesting enough, if a little repetitive. A set of deleted and extended scenes display what they discuss was taken out in the commentaries. A twenty minute making-of featurette goes back over the same material and a trailer closes out the disc.So what if it plays as much as a standalone installment of The Walking Dead and isn't the best indie horror movie you'll find? Dead Weight actually works pretty well, at least as far as post-apocalyptic romances are concerned. At times, the writing and direction are a little bit lacking, but the performances are pretty good and the writing/directing duo are just starting out and show a lot of promise.Daryl Loomis, DVD VERDICTRead the full review at dvdverdict.com",4,Worthy first effort that makes me excited for the future.,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,4448,"['Post-apocalyptic', 'movies', 'zombies', 'have', 'always', 'gone', 'hand-in-hand', 'apocalypse', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'imply', 'zombies', 'always', 'element', 'when', 'assume', 'dead', 'are', 'rising', 'graves', 'First', 'time', 'writer/directors', 'Adam', 'Bartlett', 'John', 'Pata', 'do', 'something', 'interesting', 'concept', 'assuming', 'zombies', 'infected', ""'re"", 'called', 'here', 'never', 'showing', 'instead', 'making', 'entire', 'conflict', 'exist', 'survivors', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'such', 'thing', 'been', 'done', 'Dead', 'Weight', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'concept.A', 'plague', 'turned', 'humanity', 'few', 'survivors', 'must', 'deal', 'infected', 'other', 'survivors', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'capable', 'anything', 'watch', 'Charlie', 'Joe', 'Belknap', 'walk', 'road', 'four', 'friends', 'small', 'Wisconsin', 'town', 'see', 'rise', 'tragic', 'fall', 'relationship', 'Samantha', 'Mary', 'Lindberg', 'woman', 'travelling', 'meet', 'When', 'finally', 'reunite', 'realize', 'choices', ""'ve"", 'made', 'rendered', 'reconciliation', 'certain', 'level', 'Dead', 'Weight', 'stand-alone', 'issue', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'one', 'get', 'new', 'characters', 'familiar', 'situation', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'fresh', 'personalities', 'react', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'issue', 'written', 'somebody', 'other', 'Robert', 'Kirkland', 'even', 'Bartlett', 'Pata', 'show', 'writing', 'directing', 'skill', 'debut', 'dialog', 'situation', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'carry', 'weight', 'comic.Mostly', 'try', 'make', 'romance', 'Charlie', 'Samantha', 'as', 'important', 'rest', 'story', 'certainly', 'conscious', 'choice', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'wanted', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'order', 'way', 'stylistically', 'interesting', 'not', 'terribly', 'effective', 'away', 'suspense.To', 'credit', 'Belknap', 'Linberg', 'do', 'quite', 'well', 'respective', 'debuts', 'have', 'certain', 'amount', 'tense', 'chemistry', 'couple', 'more', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'effective', 'seem', 'belong', 'film', 'rest', 'cast', 'varying', 'levels', 'experience', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'nature', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'necessary', 'none', 'get', 'time', 'breathe.Bartlett', 'Pata', 'show', 'fair', 'bit', 'style', 'Dead', 'Weight', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'plot', 'filmed', 'almost', 'color', 'only', 'faintest', 'blues', 'greys', 'screen', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'shot', 'brightly', 'modern', 'saturated', 'tones', 'cheap', 'film', 'course', 'make', 'work', 'resources', 'have', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'worthy', 'first', 'effort', 'excited', 'future.Dead', 'Weight', 'Horizon', 'Movies', 'DVD', 'much', 'stronger', 'movies', 'would', 'normally', 'get', '1.78:1', 'anamorphic', 'image', ""n't"", 'anything', 'particularly', 'special', 'still', 'pretty', 'strong', 'sharp', 'nice', 'bright', 'colors', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'good', 'black', 'levels', 'dark', 'rest', 'film', 'Sound', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'surround', 'stereo', 'sound', 'sound', 'pretty', 'much', 'identical', 'clear', 'sharp', 'suppose', 'surround', 'track', 'little', 'bit', 'action', 'rear', 'channels', 'not', 'much', 'account', 'for.Extra', 'features', 'start', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'first', 'writer/directors', 'Bartlett', 'Pata', 'one', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accuse', 'lacking', 'enthusiasm', 'talk', 'animatedly', 'aspects', 'film', 'maybe', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'hey', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'whatever', 'More', 'conventional', 'actors', 'commentary', 'Belknap', 'Lindberg', 'who', 'go', 'over', 'much', 'same', 'material', 'interesting', 'enough', 'little', 'repetitive', 'set', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'display', 'what', 'discuss', 'was', 'taken', 'out', 'commentaries', 'twenty', 'minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'back', 'same', 'material', 'trailer', 'out', 'disc.So', 'what', 'as', 'much', 'standalone', 'installment', 'Walking', 'Dead', ""n't"", 'best', 'indie', 'horror', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Dead', 'Weight', 'actually', 'pretty', 'well', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'post-apocalyptic', 'romances', 'are', 'concerned', 'times', 'writing', 'direction', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'lacking', 'performances', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'writing/directing', 'duo', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'show', 'lot', 'promise.Daryl', 'Loomis', 'DVD', 'VERDICTRead', 'full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",Dead Weight

1645676,A1L65Z8AGOYY89,B00CBVWX6A,Fin,"[3, 4]","I'd have given it 3 stars but the chemistry between Charlie and his girlfriend (the  main characters) was a total and complete disaster.  When they were together it felt like they couldn't really stand each other, would never consider touching each other, and were disgusted by the idea of kissing each other.  This makes Charlie's obsessive and pathological quest to find her completely unbelievable.  Which unfortunately is the basis of the whole plot.  Strangely - that doesn't &#34;kill&#34; this movie.  Just automatically pops it out of the 4 or 5 star spectrum.There were peaks in the movie that were very good and sometimes even &#34;non-B&#34; moments.  There were also equally low valleys.  Both of these extremes were completely driven by the acting.  Whereas the story was ultimately good there were a couple of actors who completely bombed, there were a few who swung from terrible to good, and a couple who were semi-consistently good.  The extreme bad acting kept pulling me out of the movie and sometimes made me question why I was watching it.  Thankfully the generic &#34;travels&#34; of the group to their destination was just interesting enough to pull me back in.Final thoughts -1) If you're looking for a Dawn of the Dead/28 days later style zombie action flick - this ISN'T for you2) If you're looking to see an &#34;ok&#34; rough estimation of the psychological toll of a virus-driven zombie-esque apocolypse has on &#34;normal&#34; people - this IS for you3) If you just want to watch a bunch of people completely avoid zombies but are intrigued by what the writers of the movie can dream up to throw at them - give it a try too.",2,A huge zombie fan - this movie was totally Horrible and Good at the Same Time,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,1654,"[""'d"", 'have', 'given', '3', 'stars', 'chemistry', 'Charlie', 'girlfriend', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'total', 'complete', 'disaster', 'When', 'were', 'together', 'felt', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'stand', 'other', 'would', 'never', 'consider', 'touching', 'other', 'were', 'disgusted', 'idea', 'kissing', 'other', 'Charlie', 'obsessive', 'pathological', 'quest', 'find', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'Which', 'unfortunately', 'basis', 'whole', 'plot', 'Strangely', ""n't"", '34', 'kill', '34', 'movie', 'Just', 'automatically', '4', '5', 'star', 'spectrum.There', 'were', 'peaks', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'sometimes', 'even', '34', 'non-B', '34', 'moments', 'were', 'also', 'equally', 'low', 'valleys', 'extremes', 'were', 'completely', 'driven', 'acting', 'story', 'was', 'ultimately', 'good', 'were', 'couple', 'actors', 'who', 'completely', 'bombed', 'were', 'few', 'who', 'swung', 'terrible', 'good', 'couple', 'who', 'were', 'semi-consistently', 'good', 'extreme', 'bad', 'acting', 'kept', 'pulling', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'made', 'question', 'why', 'was', 'watching', 'Thankfully', 'generic', '34', 'travels', '34', 'group', 'destination', 'was', 'just', 'interesting', 'enough', 'pull', 'back', 'in.Final', 'thoughts', '-1', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Dawn', 'Dead/28', 'days', 'later', 'style', 'zombie', 'action', 'flick', ""N'T"", 'you2', ""'re"", 'looking', 'see', '34', '34', 'rough', 'estimation', 'psychological', 'toll', 'virus-driven', 'zombie-esque', 'apocolypse', '34', 'normal', '34', 'people', 'you3', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'bunch', 'people', 'completely', 'avoid', 'zombies', 'are', 'intrigued', 'what', 'writers', 'movie', 'can', 'dream', 'up', 'throw', 'give', 'try', 'too']",Dead Weight

One episode of the &#34;Walking Dead&#34; is 100 times better than this movie.",1,Boring as dead.,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,468,"['Sounded', 'great', 'escape', '34', 'infected', '34', 'people', 'movie', 'Possibly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'Barely', '1', 'star', 'rating', 'movie', 'just', 'drags', 'Charlie', 'who', 'trying', 'meet', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'destination', 'acting', 'mostly', 'fair', 'poor', 'One', 'episode', '34', 'Walking', 'Dead', '34', '100', 'times', 'better', 'movie']",Dead Weight
1645681,A112UYCJEYZPIP,B00CBVWX6A,"Michael S. Whitman ""michaelwsf""","[6, 9]",This movie was slow.  The acting was average and that's being generous.  During most of the movie you're not even sure what they're afraid of or running from since you see no proof until close to the end.  Even when they do show you proof it's not scary.  This was a waste of $3.99 and a big waste of my time.  This movie is dead weight indeed!,1,Dead Weight Indeed,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,344,"['movie', 'was', 'slow', 'acting', 'was', 'average', 'being', 'generous', 'most', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'what', ""'re"", 'afraid', 'running', 'see', 'proof', 'close', 'end', 'Even', 'when', 'do', 'show', 'proof', 'not', 'scary', 'was', 'waste', '3.99', 'big', 'waste', 'time', 'movie', 'dead', 'weight', 'indeed']",Dead Weight
