I like that the Walk Strong focuses on specific muscle groups and also pumps it up a bit with walking exercises. You will sweat a bit and you will feel muscles all through your body when you are done. I also like it because its a 30 minute tape and you get a complete workout. The people in the tape doing the exercises with you are very approachable, and are not models. They look like real people. Leslie is very bubbly and encouraging. This is a good tape if you are beginning because you can start off slow. Its also good if you are more advanced because you can shorten the resistance band to make it harder for you. I also did this video with small hand weights when I did not have a resistance band. The ""Stretchie Band"" is around 8 dollars on Leslie's website. I think shes wonderful and I'e been exercising 5 days a week now for 2 months. You will definitely see improvement in your body and will feel great after working out with Leslie. I give this 5 stars. I can't wait to do her workouts at the end of the day. I also recommend the 4 mile super challenge ( walk away the pounds series) because it is really challenging. Its an hour long work out and really makes you sweat and you get some good cardio in there.",5,"Good to get you started, and keeps you going!",1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,1332,"['one', 'first', 'videos', 'Leslie', 'bought', 'trying', 'tapes', 'did', 'not', 'exercise', 'like', 'Walk', 'Strong', 'specific', 'muscle', 'groups', 'also', 'pumps', 'up', 'bit', 'walking', 'exercises', 'will', 'sweat', 'bit', 'will', 'feel', 'muscles', 'body', 'when', 'are', 'done', 'also', '30', 'minute', 'tape', 'get', 'complete', 'workout', 'people', 'tape', 'doing', 'exercises', 'are', 'very', 'approachable', 'are', 'not', 'models', 'look', 'real', 'people', 'Leslie', 'very', 'bubbly', 'encouraging', 'good', 'tape', 'are', 'beginning', 'can', 'start', 'off', 'slow', 'also', 'good', 'are', 'more', 'advanced', 'can', 'shorten', 'resistance', 'band', 'make', 'harder', 'also', 'did', 'video', 'small', 'hand', 'weights', 'when', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'resistance', 'band', 'Stretchie', 'Band', 'around', '8', 'dollars', 'Leslie', 'website', 'think', 'shes', 'wonderful', 'e', 'been', 'exercising', '5', 'days', 'week', 'now', '2', 'months', 'will', 'definitely', 'see', 'improvement', 'body', 'will', 'feel', 'great', 'working', 'out', 'Leslie', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'do', 'workouts', 'end', 'day', 'also', 'recommend', '4', 'mile', 'super', 'challenge', 'walk', 'away', 'pounds', 'series', 'really', 'challenging', 'hour', 'long', 'work', 'out', 'really', 'sweat', 'get', 'good', 'cardio', 'there']",Leslie Sansone: Walk Away the Pounds - Express - Walk Strong
