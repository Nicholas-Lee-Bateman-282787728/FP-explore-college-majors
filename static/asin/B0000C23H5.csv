772294,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B0000C23H5,Draconis Blackthorne,"[2, 2]","I was pleasantly surprised while inspecting the special features disc on My recently-acquired Omen Collection {I-IV, special features disc, plus the 6/6/06 remake, also containing the 666 Revelations featurette with Rev. Moore}, the films which I had previously collected on VHS, but having them now on DVD is just splendid. I discovered 'The Omen Legacy' documentary included hereon, which features none other than Church of Satan Magistra Blanche Barton commenting from the Satanic perspective on the effects this series has had on culture. Most notably, when asked about the III finale {the DP}, she observes that {paraphrased} ""...Well, I suppose it makes people feel better, although it seems rather contrived"". Considering the herd's dualistic mentality, it seems true for this entertainment fare, although these are timelessly amusing for what they are.The Omen CurseIn the curses and coincidences section, the legendary Omen Curse is related, recounting the strange incidents surrounding the production of these films, from a pilot who crashed his plane onto a car containing his wife and children, to two seperate planes being struck by lightning, prop malfunctions, near and fatal auto collisions which took the life of a special effects technician's girlfriend {who was decapitated}, health problems, and a constantly pervasive sensation of ""evil"". There were even christian nuts and weakan protestors {humorously, the latter were called ""devil-worshippers"" by the media!}, and the suicide of a girl who claimed influence by the movies.HighlightsOther highlights include behind-the-scenes footage from the sets, greatest moments scenes, personal recollections and experiences, innovative special effects techniques, rare art and photography, and interviews with Magistra Blanche Barton, producers Richard Donner & Mace Neufeld, screenwriter David Seltzer, actors David Warner, Lance Henriksen, Lee Grant, Lisa Harrow, and Michael Lerner.Also included are commentries by Catholic Priest and professor of theology Dr. Felix Just, and protestant minister Rev. Doug Posey, who relate the typical christian opinion on the antichrist mythos, claiming The Devil did not want the movie made, stating the ubiquitous ""the greatest lie of The Devil is that He doesn't exist..."" Well hypothetically, perhaps 'The Gentleman' DID want it made, and just utilized the propaganda to make it all even more interesting...Throughout the conversations, Omens I -IV are covered in this documentary, as the subsequent Omen 666 had not yet been made. All this wonderful content accompanied by the brooding narration of Jack Palance creates a delightfully nefarious atmosphere framing the series nicely. Highly recommended for Omen fantoms and collectors of Church of Satan media interviews.",5,A dark discovery...,1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,2777,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'inspecting', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'My', 'recently-acquired', 'Omen', 'Collection', 'I-IV', 'special', 'features', 'disc', '6/6/06', 'remake', 'also', 'containing', '666', 'Revelations', 'featurette', 'Rev', 'Moore', 'films', 'had', 'previously', 'collected', 'VHS', 'having', 'now', 'DVD', 'just', 'splendid', 'discovered', 'Omen', 'Legacy', 'documentary', 'included', 'hereon', 'none', 'other', 'Church', 'Satan', 'Magistra', 'Blanche', 'Barton', 'commenting', 'Satanic', 'perspective', 'effects', 'series', 'had', 'culture', 'Most', 'notably', 'when', 'asked', 'III', 'finale', 'DP', 'paraphrased', 'Well', 'suppose', 'people', 'feel', 'better', 'rather', 'contrived', 'Considering', 'herd', 'dualistic', 'mentality', 'true', 'entertainment', 'fare', 'are', 'timelessly', 'amusing', 'what', 'are.The', 'Omen', 'CurseIn', 'curses', 'coincidences', 'section', 'legendary', 'Omen', 'Curse', 'related', 'recounting', 'strange', 'incidents', 'surrounding', 'production', 'films', 'pilot', 'who', 'crashed', 'plane', 'car', 'containing', 'wife', 'children', 'two', 'seperate', 'planes', 'being', 'struck', 'lightning', 'prop', 'malfunctions', 'fatal', 'auto', 'collisions', 'took', 'life', 'special', 'effects', 'technician', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'was', 'decapitated', 'health', 'problems', 'constantly', 'pervasive', 'sensation', 'evil', 'were', 'even', 'christian', 'nuts', 'weakan', 'protestors', 'humorously', 'latter', 'were', 'called', 'devil-worshippers', 'media', 'suicide', 'girl', 'who', 'claimed', 'influence', 'movies.HighlightsOther', 'highlights', 'include', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'sets', 'greatest', 'moments', 'scenes', 'personal', 'recollections', 'experiences', 'innovative', 'special', 'effects', 'techniques', 'rare', 'art', 'photography', 'interviews', 'Magistra', 'Blanche', 'Barton', 'producers', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Mace', 'Neufeld', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Seltzer', 'actors', 'David', 'Warner', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'Lisa', 'Harrow', 'Michael', 'Lerner.Also', 'included', 'are', 'commentries', 'Catholic', 'Priest', 'professor', 'theology', 'Dr.', 'Felix', 'Just', 'protestant', 'minister', 'Rev', 'Doug', 'Posey', 'who', 'relate', 'typical', 'christian', 'opinion', 'antichrist', 'mythos', 'claiming', 'Devil', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'movie', 'made', 'stating', 'ubiquitous', 'greatest', 'lie', 'Devil', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Well', 'hypothetically', 'perhaps', 'Gentleman', 'DID', 'want', 'made', 'just', 'utilized', 'propaganda', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'conversations', 'Omens', '-IV', 'are', 'covered', 'documentary', 'subsequent', 'Omen', '666', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'made', 'wonderful', 'content', 'accompanied', 'brooding', 'narration', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'delightfully', 'nefarious', 'atmosphere', 'framing', 'series', 'nicely', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Omen', 'fantoms', 'collectors', 'Church', 'Satan', 'media', 'interviews']",N/A

This documentary goes into the movies themselves &amp; the strange stories that happened during the filming of the movies. People who were making these films started to believe that they were cursed.

It is somewhat dated now but it is interesting hearing about the true stories that afflicted the people who made these movies. Jack Palance narrates this documentary focusing on the influence of The Omen and three of its sequels. Interviews with David Warner, Lance Henriksen, Lee Grant and commentary from religious scholars and critics are included. It seems there is an Omen curse. Similar problems were reported when making The Exorcist and Poltergeist. Fans will appreciate this documentary as a nice bonus feature in The Omen Collection on Blu-ray. It is considered a must-watch by hardcore Omen fans but it is nowhere near as comprehensive as newer horror documentaries like Never Sleep Again or Crystal Lake Memories. It is probably on par with His Name Was Jason.

772299,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,B0000C23H5,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","Before beginning this review, I want to point to my omen rant at fox for not including this in the box set. One has to wonder what Fox was thinking. As a quick recap, while the fourth films dvd does not include a trailer of the film, the trailer is included here. Why not on the DVD then if available?But that rant aside, this is an amazing documentary. Like the rest of the Omen films, the menu is cool as hell and fits the theme work they did with the other films nicely. They include animated clips from all films as the layout.Besides the documentary itself, we have the four trailers of the series, as well as Power and the Devil: The Making of Damien: The Omen 2.Apparently Fox didn't want to include this on the Omen 2 disc, but instead separate (*cough* box set *cough). I figured when I picked up this disc that they would cover part one more than anything, call it a hunch. Since it was the most popular film of the series, and got the best DVD treatment, I figured it would be a teacher's pet sort of deal. That wasn't the case, thankfully; all movies got in the spotlight, even the rather dismissal Omen 4.Narrated by Jack Palance, the documentary begins by discussing how the films have always looked to the bible, and when the 60's came around, how the darker side of the bible started to emerge in certain media. We have a large variety of speakers to follow, including Blanche Barton, the high priestess from the church of Satan (!?), David Seltzer (novelist), and Reverand Doug Posey. They briefly mention other films like Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist during this theme.As there was a large surge in Christianity as a result of this movie, different viewpoints on that are discussed, as well as what the Omen had to do with it. They bring up that the Exorcist made over 100 million in its first theatrical release before the Omen film, and that for the first time in over 30 years bible sales tripled.In 1974, Robert Munger (Religious Advisor), also on the Omen documentary, thought up the idea of the film. Trivia on the thought of the first Omen is given out, such as Gregory Pecks sons suicide before they approached him for the part, the original name of the movie (The Birthmark) because of objections of pregnant women (!), among other things.The Omen SE has an outstanding documentary included on its disc, but this legacy documentary seems to delve more into the special effects than that one did. They speak of the advertising and promotion (2.8 million just to get the word out), putting it on buses, store windows, you name it. They played up the Omen Curse and released Seltzer's novel six weeks before the films release.Since the Omen is more religious horror that most, it's inevitable that religious angles would be discussed in decent depth. As one point, many religious scholars ended up applauding the studios for getting the audience to read their bibles and were award theology school awards for the Omen film. But also many groups, such as certain Catholic sects, disapproved.Each movie is spoken of in terms of original concept, problems, casting choices, pitfalls, monetary outcomes, studio issues, and directing goals. Personal opinions are dished out on the original drives and the eventual outcomes; memories of the past and hopes for the future are mentioned. As said before, each movie gets its own airtime. Part one and two probably get a little more than the other two, but I was surprised to see so much time dedicated to the less celebrated fourth. They didn't diss the movie at all, and instead talked about why it was done (money dreams), thoughts of bringing the films out to more of a TV crowd, things such as that.About anything and everything is discussed in the Omen Legacy. If you are a fan of the series, this is a must have. Even if you're just a fan of the first, or the second, this proves interesting just because of the theory, reasoning, and reactions told. I won't mention again how much of a shame it was this wasn't included in the set originally (oops, just did), but suffice to say it's an excellent follow up and owning the box set just doesn't feel complete without this one too. Or, if you're just a horror documentary buff, this is definitely worth a buy or a rent.",5,Thorough and Entertaining,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,4242,"['beginning', 'review', 'want', 'point', 'omen', 'rant', 'fox', 'not', 'including', 'box', 'set', 'One', 'wonder', 'what', 'Fox', 'was', 'thinking', 'quick', 'recap', 'fourth', 'films', 'dvd', 'not', 'include', 'trailer', 'film', 'trailer', 'included', 'here', 'Why', 'not', 'DVD', 'then', 'available', 'rant', 'aside', 'amazing', 'documentary', 'rest', 'Omen', 'films', 'menu', 'cool', 'hell', 'theme', 'work', 'did', 'other', 'films', 'nicely', 'include', 'animated', 'clips', 'films', 'layout.Besides', 'documentary', 'have', 'four', 'trailers', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'Power', 'Devil', 'Making', 'Damien', 'Omen', '2.Apparently', 'Fox', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'include', 'Omen', '2', 'disc', 'instead', 'separate', '*cough*', 'box', 'set', '*cough', 'figured', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'disc', 'would', 'cover', 'part', 'one', 'more', 'anything', 'call', 'hunch', 'was', 'most', 'popular', 'film', 'series', 'got', 'best', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'teacher', 'pet', 'sort', 'deal', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'thankfully', 'movies', 'got', 'spotlight', 'even', 'rather', 'dismissal', 'Omen', '4.Narrated', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'documentary', 'discussing', 'how', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'looked', 'bible', 'when', '60', 'came', 'around', 'how', 'darker', 'side', 'bible', 'started', 'emerge', 'certain', 'media', 'have', 'large', 'variety', 'speakers', 'follow', 'including', 'Blanche', 'Barton', 'high', 'priestess', 'church', 'Satan', 'David', 'Seltzer', 'novelist', 'Reverand', 'Doug', 'Posey', 'briefly', 'mention', 'other', 'films', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Exorcist', 'theme.As', 'was', 'large', 'surge', 'Christianity', 'result', 'movie', 'different', 'viewpoints', 'are', 'discussed', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'Omen', 'had', 'do', 'bring', 'up', 'Exorcist', 'made', 'over', '100', 'million', 'first', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Omen', 'film', 'first', 'time', '30', 'years', 'bible', 'sales', 'tripled.In', '1974', 'Robert', 'Munger', 'Religious', 'Advisor', 'also', 'Omen', 'documentary', 'thought', 'up', 'idea', 'film', 'Trivia', 'thought', 'first', 'Omen', 'given', 'out', 'such', 'Gregory', 'Pecks', 'sons', 'suicide', 'approached', 'part', 'original', 'name', 'movie', 'Birthmark', 'objections', 'pregnant', 'women', 'other', 'things.The', 'Omen', 'SE', 'outstanding', 'documentary', 'included', 'disc', 'legacy', 'documentary', 'delve', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'did', 'speak', 'advertising', 'promotion', '2.8', 'million', 'just', 'get', 'word', 'putting', 'buses', 'store', 'windows', 'name', 'played', 'up', 'Omen', 'Curse', 'released', 'Seltzer', 'novel', 'six', 'weeks', 'films', 'release.Since', 'Omen', 'more', 'religious', 'horror', 'most', 'inevitable', 'religious', 'angles', 'would', 'be', 'discussed', 'decent', 'depth', 'one', 'point', 'many', 'religious', 'scholars', 'ended', 'up', 'applauding', 'studios', 'getting', 'audience', 'read', 'bibles', 'were', 'award', 'theology', 'school', 'awards', 'Omen', 'film', 'also', 'many', 'groups', 'such', 'certain', 'Catholic', 'sects', 'disapproved.Each', 'movie', 'spoken', 'terms', 'original', 'concept', 'problems', 'casting', 'choices', 'pitfalls', 'monetary', 'outcomes', 'studio', 'issues', 'directing', 'goals', 'Personal', 'opinions', 'are', 'dished', 'out', 'original', 'drives', 'eventual', 'outcomes', 'memories', 'past', 'future', 'are', 'mentioned', 'said', 'movie', 'own', 'airtime', 'Part', 'one', 'two', 'probably', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'other', 'two', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'dedicated', 'less', 'celebrated', 'fourth', 'did', ""n't"", 'diss', 'movie', 'instead', 'talked', 'why', 'was', 'done', 'money', 'dreams', 'thoughts', 'bringing', 'films', 'out', 'more', 'TV', 'crowd', 'things', 'such', 'that.About', 'anything', 'everything', 'discussed', 'Omen', 'Legacy', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'must', 'have', 'Even', ""'re"", 'just', 'fan', 'first', 'second', 'interesting', 'just', 'theory', 'reasoning', 'reactions', 'told', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'again', 'how', 'much', 'shame', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'set', 'originally', 'oops', 'just', 'did', 'suffice', 'say', 'excellent', 'follow', 'up', 'owning', 'box', 'set', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'complete', 'one', 'too', ""'re"", 'just', 'horror', 'documentary', 'buff', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buy', 'rent']",N/A
