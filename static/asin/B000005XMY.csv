Whoever marched and dedicated his or her life to the conquest of the impossible should feel a warming of the heart and brain watching Richard Dreyfus, always one to make that which makes sense also fun. Any movie that has a big ugly monkey of a man as John Lithgow asking seriously ""What do you know about the underground?"" deserves to be seen. The fellow, Roger L. Simon, who wrote the script for these people, knew the era and its people, the passion, the undercurrents, the end. ""The sixties are over, Lily,"" he says and the whole effort to make the world better ended in an acid trip that burned the brains of many, while for the mopping up mortgages and car payments took care of the rest.  I find it hard to be objective watching this movie. I confess, as an excuse I was one of the people that thought that the world could be made into a better place. Watching Dreyfus is a trip into memory lane.  So, I lost my objectivity? Sue me! This is a great movie, enjoy it, and if you don't... well look for one with machine guns and bombs and drink your Pepsi. When they make, if they make the Blu-ray of this movie I'll buy a dozen for the friends and singing I'll go, ""we shall overcome..."" cynicism be damned.

492736,A1FFECJZ8ZEHL1,B000005XMY,Gregg Howard,"[0, 0]","Regretably, I had to buy a tired old vhs copy...but the pathos and accuracy of this movie still shows through. It is nice to be reminded of why Dreyfuss was so well-respected as an actor back before he was relegated solely to the role of curmudgeon or or aging cynic. In this film, he portrays his character's fight of a heroic battle against his own cynicism and that of our decaying culture with a performance that has honesty and disingenuous charm. For a darker but more powerful reminder of why Dreyfuss was once so admired, I recommend the obscure but dazzling &#34;Inserts&#34;: it is one of his very best performances ever, but this one deserves a rerelease as well!",4,This film should be rereleased on dvd!,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,674,"['Regretably', 'had', 'buy', 'tired', 'old', 'vhs', 'copy', 'pathos', 'accuracy', 'movie', 'still', 'nice', 'be', 'reminded', 'why', 'Dreyfuss', 'was', 'so', 'well-respected', 'actor', 'back', 'was', 'relegated', 'solely', 'role', 'curmudgeon', 'aging', 'cynic', 'film', 'character', 'fight', 'heroic', 'battle', 'own', 'cynicism', 'decaying', 'culture', 'performance', 'honesty', 'disingenuous', 'charm', 'darker', 'more', 'powerful', 'reminder', 'why', 'Dreyfuss', 'was', 'once', 'so', 'admired', 'recommend', 'obscure', 'dazzling', '34', 'Inserts', '34', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'one', 'rerelease', 'as', 'well']",The Big Fix VHS

Wine's kids (visitation weekend) as junior-PI sidekicks, murder, migrant labor issues. And throw in an insideous little song.

492741,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B000005XMY,William Timothy Lukeman,"[2, 2]","A terrific adaptation of the post-countercultural PI novel the introduced Moses Wine, this film works both as a portrait of the aftermath of the 1960s, when ideals & passion had faded & were turning into the mass-marketed plastic world of the 1970s, and as a classic convoluted mystery. Richard Dreyfuss was born to play Moses Wine, and it's a pity the film didn't do better, as it would have been fun to see him return in a couple of sequels. F. Murray Abraham shines as the elusive Howard Eppis, capturing the political acumen & gleeful mischief of Abbie Hoffman & company. And whatever happened to the wonderful Susan Anspach, who gives a haunted, heartwrenching performance as a lost soul still clinging to the ideals that inspired so many of us, even as a more predatory & soulless culture once more took hold of America?This really needs to be released on DVD -- preferably an official studio DVD, with commentary from Dreyfuss & the other cast members -- but at the very least on a made-to-order DVD.
