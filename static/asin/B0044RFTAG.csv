When I saw this episode for the first time on The Westerns Channel about three years ago I was blown away by the actress playing Sarah Jane.  Everything was spot on:  LIne delivery, expressions, gestures, posture.  As the show played out I kep saying &#34;She is very, very good,&#34; and following with the question &#34;Why don't I know her?&#34;  Jena Engstrom appeared in about 37 TV episodes from 1960 to 1964 before suffereing what was described at the time as a nervous breakdown.  She never returned to acting.  It is very sad because she was so very good.  And director Boone sensed that and got an engaging performance from not only her, but from Duane Eddy.  The two youngsters (then) played very well off of one another, and that is to Richard Boone's credit, too.  There are a lot of TV shows from the past that do not hold up well, but this is not one -- it is a very watchable series.",5,"Bought it for ""The Education of Sarah Jane"" episode.",1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,1067,"['bought', 'volume', 'one', 'episode', '34', 'Education', 'Sarah', 'Jane', '34', 'was', 'directed', 'star', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'guest-starred', 'Duane', 'Eddy', 'Jena', 'Engstrom', 'When', 'saw', 'episode', 'first', 'time', 'Westerns', 'Channel', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'actress', 'playing', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Everything', 'was', 'spot', 'LIne', 'delivery', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'posture', 'show', 'played', 'out', 'kep', 'saying', '34', 'very', 'very', 'good', '34', 'following', 'question', '34', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '34', 'Jena', 'Engstrom', 'appeared', '37', 'TV', 'episodes', '1960', '1964', 'suffereing', 'what', 'was', 'described', 'time', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'never', 'returned', 'acting', 'very', 'sad', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'good', 'director', 'Boone', 'sensed', 'got', 'engaging', 'performance', 'not', 'only', 'Duane', 'Eddy', 'two', 'youngsters', 'then', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'credit', 'too', 'are', 'lot', 'TV', 'shows', 'past', 'do', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'not', 'one', 'very', 'watchable', 'series']",N/A

It's all downhill from here. But the best gems here can be found in ""The Race"" with Ben Johnson and ""The Hanging of Aaron Gibbs"" with Odetta. It's also nice to see Kam Tong as Hey Boy return to the series since Hey Girl was on the last season. (He apparently had his own detective Charlie-Chan rip-off TV series.)

1385302,A3USZM6HYVCIRZ,B0044RFTAG,Roger M. Longo,"[23, 23]","I have been a fan of Have Gun Will Travel since I first saw it during the 1950s. It was the precursor of Kung Fu. In both cases the central character was ""a knight without armor in a savage land."" Both series also emphasized moral values through the central character's emphasis on helping those in need. Both series also had a distinct intellectual bent. In the case of Paladin the emphasis was placed on Western philosophy with quotable quotes by Paladin from major philosophers in conjunction with challenging ethical quagmires. Kane, the central character in Kung Fu and other characters such as Masters Han and Poe, also provided similar insights with an oriental thrust. In the final analysis, Have Gun Will Travel is one of the best TV series that ever hit the airways.However I also agree with the comments offered by another reviewer regarding corporate greed. The pricing of this series is nothing more than a transparent ploy to make as much money as possible at the customer's expense. Possibly those who developed this strategy should take the time to view this series (along with Kung Fu) in the hopes of developing a moral center.",5,Have Gun will Travel,1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,1145,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'first', 'saw', '1950s', 'was', 'precursor', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'cases', 'central', 'character', 'was', 'knight', 'armor', 'savage', 'land', 'series', 'also', 'emphasized', 'moral', 'values', 'central', 'character', 'emphasis', 'helping', 'need', 'series', 'also', 'had', 'distinct', 'intellectual', 'bent', 'case', 'Paladin', 'emphasis', 'was', 'placed', 'Western', 'philosophy', 'quotable', 'quotes', 'Paladin', 'major', 'philosophers', 'conjunction', 'challenging', 'ethical', 'quagmires', 'Kane', 'central', 'character', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'other', 'characters', 'such', 'Masters', 'Han', 'Poe', 'also', 'provided', 'similar', 'insights', 'oriental', 'thrust', 'final', 'analysis', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'series', 'ever', 'hit', 'airways.However', 'also', 'agree', 'comments', 'offered', 'reviewer', 'regarding', 'corporate', 'greed', 'pricing', 'series', 'nothing', 'more', 'transparent', 'ploy', 'make', 'much', 'money', 'possible', 'customer', 'expense', 'Possibly', 'who', 'developed', 'strategy', 'should', 'take', 'time', 'view', 'series', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'hopes', 'developing', 'moral', 'center']",N/A
