1586299,A55MRYPUAX4QU,B0096PBD2O,Avid Reader,"[0, 1]","This should have a ""YA"" in the title.  It is geared toward the 11-12 year old girl.  The acting was so stumbling and confusing that it was downright embarrassing.  The chemistry between the two protagonists was non-existent - almost painful to watch.  James van der Beek seemed confused (and pained at times) as he went through the motions.  Sarah Thomas, (I've forgotten their film names) is a ""young"" woman (turning 30).  After being rejected a spot on the Olympic rowing team she quits and returns home.Able performances by Glenn Morshower and Margaret Colin are dragged down by Thomas.  She is tentative, gawky, dresses in baggy athletic outfits 90% of the movie and seems relaxed only when working out.  She's so dull (sorry but that's the only word to describe it).  The ""relationship"" between her and van der Beek is of a 7th grade spin the bottle type. She blinks her eyes, smiles, flirts, he gives her a quick kiss on a balcony - you get it.It's formulaic to the nth degree.  Mom wants a daughter to do girly things (like show an interest in guys), she stumbles but ultimately succeeds as a girls rowing coach, falls for the hero who is dating a cute girl, is offered a last-minute spot on the team but courageously let's her best friend take it, ends up a ""winner"" in life and maybe the hero's girlfriend. It's hard to tell.  Perfect for a middle school slumber party.",2,So Awkward,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,1378,"['should', 'have', 'YA', 'title', 'geared', '11-12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'stumbling', 'confusing', 'was', 'downright', 'embarrassing', 'chemistry', 'two', 'protagonists', 'was', 'non-existent', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'James', 'van', 'der', 'Beek', 'seemed', 'confused', 'pained', 'times', 'went', 'motions', 'Sarah', 'Thomas', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'film', 'names', 'young', 'woman', 'turning', '30', 'being', 'rejected', 'spot', 'Olympic', 'rowing', 'team', 'returns', 'home.Able', 'performances', 'Glenn', 'Morshower', 'Margaret', 'Colin', 'are', 'dragged', 'down', 'Thomas', 'tentative', 'gawky', 'dresses', 'baggy', 'athletic', 'outfits', '90', '%', 'movie', 'relaxed', 'only', 'when', 'working', 'out', 'so', 'dull', 'sorry', 'only', 'word', 'describe', 'relationship', 'van', 'der', 'Beek', '7th', 'grade', 'spin', 'bottle', 'type', 'eyes', 'smiles', 'flirts', 'quick', 'kiss', 'balcony', 'get', 'it.It', 'formulaic', 'nth', 'degree', 'Mom', 'daughter', 'do', 'girly', 'things', 'show', 'interest', 'guys', 'ultimately', 'girls', 'rowing', 'coach', 'hero', 'who', 'dating', 'cute', 'girl', 'offered', 'last-minute', 'spot', 'team', 'courageously', 'let', 'best', 'friend', 'take', 'up', 'winner', 'life', 'maybe', 'hero', 'girlfriend', 'hard', 'tell', 'Perfect', 'middle', 'school', 'slumber', 'party']",Backwards

1586301,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B0096PBD2O,mk,"[0, 0]","If you want a bit of rah, rah you can do it via girls' rowing team, and throw in some romance, typical character internal struggle- what greatness is really about- and put it in a predictable but overall well done format of a movie, then, here you go.A failed Olympian-to-be woman rower is forced to take less desirable, personal choices in life; however, she discovers unexpected richness in pursuing teaching/coaching with some tough decisions to make.The film is well shot(Philidelphia backdrop), - the acting realistic with a heroine, Sarah Megan Thomas, who sometimes gets on my nerves with her motives and self-centeredness- true to form.  Jason Van Der Beek(Where's Mrs. Miracle when you need her?) co-stars and does fine as the counter balance and romantic interest.Yes, it's all kind of by the numbers.  We've seen this before many times, but that's ok.  Good to encourage one to work hard to achieve something. 3 1/2 stars. PG for mild language.  It shows a little drinking.

Again. She decides to throw it in and go home where she makes a run at high school coaching. Her high school flame is the director of sports there. Abby may well be surprised just how much she likes it.Good family night movie. The plots and themes are clean, simple and innocent. It really builds on the good things like hard work, choices and determination.  What I enjoyed most was watching Abby build relationships with the girls. It helped them and it helped Abby.I gave it 4 stars because, though it was a nice enough movie, it didn't stand out.

1586303,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0096PBD2O,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[3, 4]","Abi Brooks (Sarah Megan Thomas) has been trying out for the Olympics all of her adult life. At age 30, she has been selected as an alternate...again. She decides not to be the alternate and quits, returning to her upscale home in the Philadelphia suburbs. She lands a job at a private school as a rowing instructor from her ex-boyfriend Geoff (James Van Der Beek). She supposedly has trouble adjusting, but it look like she did just fine.Abi bonds with her students and prepares them for an upcoming match when she suddenly gets a chance to be in the Olympics as a starter. She wants to leave for the Olympics, something that would be a major selling point for the school, but the movie makes her out to be a selfish individual who would rather piddle around as a once in a lifetime Olympic athlete instead of teaching rowing in high school.Sarah Megan Thomas was all wrong for the part, lacking muscle tone and visible upper body strength. This is a movie to show your kids to let them know how much they ruined your life and dreams, so they better appreciate it.It is supposed to be a feel good film, perhaps for teachers. 5 stars for after school movie fans.",3,"EAT, SLEEP, ROW",1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,1161,"['Abi', 'Brooks', 'Sarah', 'Megan', 'Thomas', 'been', 'trying', 'out', 'Olympics', 'adult', 'life', 'age', '30', 'been', 'selected', 'alternate', 'again', 'not', 'be', 'alternate', 'quits', 'returning', 'upscale', 'home', 'Philadelphia', 'suburbs', 'job', 'private', 'school', 'rowing', 'instructor', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Geoff', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'supposedly', 'trouble', 'adjusting', 'look', 'did', 'just', 'fine.Abi', 'bonds', 'students', 'upcoming', 'match', 'when', 'suddenly', 'chance', 'be', 'Olympics', 'starter', 'leave', 'Olympics', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'major', 'selling', 'point', 'school', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'selfish', 'individual', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'piddle', 'around', 'once', 'lifetime', 'Olympic', 'athlete', 'instead', 'teaching', 'rowing', 'high', 'school.Sarah', 'Megan', 'Thomas', 'was', 'wrong', 'part', 'lacking', 'muscle', 'tone', 'visible', 'upper', 'body', 'strength', 'movie', 'show', 'kids', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'ruined', 'life', 'dreams', 'better', 'appreciate', 'it.It', 'supposed', 'be', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'perhaps', 'teachers', '5', 'stars', 'school', 'movie', 'fans']",Backwards
