1082719,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000RMRV1W,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[18, 18]","If a role ever 'fit' an actor perfectly, Robert B. Parker's alcoholic, laconic ex-L.A. cop/small town Police Chief Jesse Stone 'fits' Tom Selleck. Paunchier and more careworn than in his ""Magnum"" days, Selleck has become a superb character actor, and this series of TV-movies offers him at the 'top of his game'.While murder is the theme of each film, the stories are even more enjoyable as character studies of a man rebuilding his life. Divorced, but still holding long phone conversations with his ex-wife, Stone has turned to whiskey for solace, costing him his job with the L.A.P.D., but not yet diminishing his skills to a point where he can't get a strong endorsement for the position of Police Chief of tiny Paradise, Massachusetts, a coastal town near Boston. The first film of the series, ""Stone Cold"", presents him already in place as Chief; it's success led to ""Jesse Stone: Night Passage"", a prequel detailing his arrival in Paradise, the murder of the previous Chief, and the death of his beloved dog; the third film of this collection, ""Jesse Stone: A Death in Paradise"", the follow-up to ""Stone Cold"", finds him attempting to deal with his alcoholism, while investigating the death of a teen-aged girl.Best of all, for fans of this series, a fourth film aired in 2007, with a fifth TV-movie in production for 2008.If you are a fan of Parker's novels, Tom Selleck, or murder mysteries rich in character development, ""The Jesse Stone Film Collection"" deserves a place on your shelf!",5,Selleck Shines as Parker's World-Weary Police Chief...,1192665600,"10 18, 2007",2007,1496,"['role', 'ever', ""'fit"", 'actor', 'perfectly', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Parker', 'alcoholic', 'laconic', 'ex-L.A.', 'cop/small', 'town', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'Paunchier', 'more', 'careworn', 'Magnum', 'days', 'Selleck', 'become', 'superb', 'character', 'actor', 'series', 'TV-movies', ""'top"", ""game'.While"", 'murder', 'theme', 'film', 'stories', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'character', 'studies', 'man', 'rebuilding', 'life', 'Divorced', 'still', 'holding', 'long', 'phone', 'conversations', 'ex-wife', 'Stone', 'turned', 'whiskey', 'solace', 'costing', 'job', 'L.A.P.D.', 'not', 'yet', 'diminishing', 'skills', 'point', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'strong', 'endorsement', 'position', 'Police', 'Chief', 'tiny', 'Paradise', 'Massachusetts', 'coastal', 'town', 'Boston', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'already', 'place', 'Chief', 'success', 'led', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'Night', 'Passage', 'prequel', 'detailing', 'arrival', 'Paradise', 'murder', 'previous', 'Chief', 'death', 'beloved', 'dog', 'third', 'film', 'collection', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'Death', 'Paradise', 'follow-up', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'attempting', 'deal', 'alcoholism', 'investigating', 'death', 'teen-aged', 'girl.Best', 'fans', 'series', 'fourth', 'film', 'aired', '2007', 'fifth', 'TV-movie', 'production', '2008.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Parker', 'novels', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'rich', 'character', 'development', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'Film', 'Collection', 'place', 'shelf']",The Jesse Stone Film Collection: (Stone Cold / Death in Paradise / Night Passage)

The movies are well done productions with superb acting, beautiful scenery, and good music. The quality of the DVDs is first class. These are the first three DVDs to be released. The stories cover how Stone lost his job for drinking on the job in L.A. to him resolving cases as Chief of the Paradise, Massachusetts police. The movies aren't full of action, but they more than make up for that in acting, storylines, and scenery. The supporting cast includes Viola Davis and Kohl Sudduth.
