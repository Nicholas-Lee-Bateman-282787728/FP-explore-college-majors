Both thought up, written and produced by the late Mr Dangerfield - as well as supplying the voice of the star canine - this is one of those concrete animated movies that time forgot. You don't at all have to be into Rodney Dangerfield's kind of humour to appreciate it. That's one of the magics of animation, how it speaks beyond such boundaries.Suave, sassy hound dog Rover (oddly, 'Dangerfield' is never mentioned as being his name during the movie) lives an easy, pleasurable life in Las Vegas with his best friend Eddie and his dog buddies, gambling and dancing the nights away. His owner, the sweet showgirl Connie, makes this all possible. But things change for Rover when Connie's shady boyfriend Rocky throws Rover off the Hoover Dam to get back at him for blowing his deal with the mafia. Somehow, Rover manages to survive, and winds up on a barn, where he must learn to take responsibility for his actions and show consideration for others in order to survive. And Rover just might discover a part of himself that he never knew he had, in the process.The animation is simply delicious. There's not a sterile, out-of-place moment in the animation or visual representation. From Rover himself to his dog friends (both on the barn and out) to his human owner Connie, the animators of this movie deserve an applause. Their work really inspires me, as a hope-to-be student of animation. The songs are not something I would listen to on my ipod but they're nice numbers that fit well in with the film.My only regret is that I wish some of the other barnyard animals besides Daisy and Ruffles would have got more spotlight attention. The dogs at the farm - Duke and Max as well as the eternally-bickering twins Lem and Clem - I find all very interesting characters that I wish could have contributed to the story more. But for a one-hour movie, I guess you can't have it all. In conclusion, this is a movie well worth your time, especially if you're into animation like me, but also if you just want a solid animated movie to watch.Rover; Mr Dangerfield; I hope that, with this review, I have given you my respect.",5,"Fabulously Animated, Forgotten Gem",1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,2255,"['Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'was', 'right', 'get', 'respect', 'brainchild', 'Rover', 'Dangerfield', 'visual', 'treat', 'animated', 'movie', 'thought', 'up', 'written', 'produced', 'late', 'Mr', 'Dangerfield', 'as', 'well', 'supplying', 'voice', 'star', 'canine', 'one', 'concrete', 'animated', 'movies', 'time', 'forgot', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'kind', 'humour', 'appreciate', 'one', 'magics', 'animation', 'how', 'such', 'boundaries.Suave', 'sassy', 'hound', 'dog', 'Rover', 'oddly', ""'Dangerfield"", 'never', 'mentioned', 'being', 'name', 'movie', 'easy', 'pleasurable', 'life', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'best', 'friend', 'Eddie', 'dog', 'buddies', 'gambling', 'dancing', 'nights', 'away', 'owner', 'sweet', 'showgirl', 'Connie', 'possible', 'things', 'change', 'Rover', 'when', 'Connie', 'shady', 'boyfriend', 'Rocky', 'Rover', 'Hoover', 'Dam', 'get', 'back', 'blowing', 'deal', 'mafia', 'Somehow', 'Rover', 'survive', 'up', 'barn', 'where', 'must', 'learn', 'take', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'show', 'consideration', 'others', 'order', 'survive', 'Rover', 'just', 'might', 'discover', 'part', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'process.The', 'animation', 'simply', 'delicious', 'not', 'sterile', 'out-of-place', 'moment', 'animation', 'visual', 'representation', 'Rover', 'dog', 'friends', 'barn', 'out', 'human', 'owner', 'Connie', 'animators', 'movie', 'deserve', 'applause', 'work', 'really', 'hope-to-be', 'student', 'animation', 'songs', 'are', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'listen', 'ipod', ""'re"", 'nice', 'numbers', 'fit', 'well', 'film.My', 'only', 'wish', 'other', 'barnyard', 'animals', 'Daisy', 'Ruffles', 'would', 'have', 'got', 'more', 'spotlight', 'attention', 'dogs', 'farm', 'Duke', 'Max', 'as', 'well', 'eternally-bickering', 'twins', 'Lem', 'Clem', 'find', 'very', 'interesting', 'characters', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'contributed', 'story', 'more', 'one-hour', 'movie', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'well', 'time', 'especially', ""'re"", 'animation', 'also', 'just', 'want', 'solid', 'animated', 'movie', 'watch.Rover', 'Mr', 'Dangerfield', 'hope', 'review', 'have', 'given', 'respect']",N/A

Everything else stinks. This is Rodney Dangerfield at his worst. It's basiclly the same thing when Celebrities try to write kids books. Everyone thinks they can do it but it takes talent to do it right but in this case they don't. Too many one-liners and total lack of development. It's clumsy at best. There are also some scences that are too dark for most kids like the dead turkey scence,the scence where we see the ladies in their dressing half-naked and scences where they talk about killing somebody. The songs are gargabe and just as bad as the songs from the Tom & Jerry film. Overall,If you want to see a good Rodney Dangerfield Movie? Go watch Caddyshack or Back To School.

305240,A1BU4XHJJ1SFM1,6302275997,Ristobee,"[11, 11]","Six years since I reviewed the VHS version and it is finally available on DVD. However, this release became bittersweet when I read, ""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media. This product is expected to play back in DVD Video ""play only"" devices, and may not play in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives."" Since I play animation on my computer while I work, I will hold off on purchasing this DVD version until my VHS tape breaks/becomes unplayable. In the meantime I will continue waiting for a high-end pressing.July 4, 2006ROVER DANGERFIELD is a very entertaining and well animated feature. However, even with a 'G' rating I do believe that some scenes may not be family-friendly. The quality of animation is top-notch. The character design is outstanding - especially the turkey, hen and rooster (their scenes are BRILLIANT) - and, most of all, Rover himself. The backgrounds are beautiful and the layouts are terrific. Honorable mention goes to the excellent 3D intro.The story, with its fine mix of comedy, adventure, and romance, can be enjoyed by a wide age range. Although the city-slicker-among-country-bumpkins plot has been done before, ROVER DANGERFIELD has enough of its own twists and charm to keep it entertaining. The lessons taught (take responsibility for your actions/think of others, not just of yourself) give the movie a solid theme. Most scenes are very funny, however, Rover/Rodney's humor is needed in a couple more of scenes to keep things lively. The script also needed some trimming here and there, as too much unnecessary dialogue tends to make some scenes drag. More of the storytelling could have been left to the obviously talented story artists and animators. In this case, action does speak louder than words..Being a movie that can be enjoyed over and over again, here's hoping ROVER DANGERFIELD gets the respect it deserves and makes its DVD debut very soon.",5,"A DVD MUST...so where is the DVD?
