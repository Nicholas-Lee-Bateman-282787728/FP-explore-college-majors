Deals with kidnapping but in a sometimes comical way, my granddaughter is 6 and she was fine with it,might be scary parts for younger than that. Very enjoyable, cant recommend enough.

40062,A3Q1FVG9D6VFPK,0782005926,"Summer S. Wilson ""Collectonian""","[9, 11]","I honestly don't see why people are saying this movie is so horrible. It is very clearly rated PG, so why would they think it was intended for little kids?  This movie is not for really young kids.  The kidnappers can be scary, though not much worse than the ones in Home Alone. The final scenes when the horses go to rescue the girls can also be scary, though again no more so than many other PG movies putting animals in dangerous situations, like Far From Home, Dinosaur, or even the Bear (which is also PG, yet I doubt any parent would let a sub-10 year old watch it)!As for the movie itself, it is an interesting tale of two girls and their two horses.  Two-Bits is a little pony, haunted by nightmares of his mother being killed by a drunk driver who when he was still young.  As a result, he can be a little insecure, so he frequently sneaks out of the barn so sleep outside his young owner, Tyler's, window. Pepper is an older gray horse, owned by Tyler's family, but always ridden by Tyler's best friend Katie. He is a little rough on Two-Bits, but also a little wise about the world and ready to listen when Two-Bits nightmares wake him up. The girls decide to ride the horses into town, against Tyler's parents specific instructions not to. They figure they won't get caught, but of course Tyler's mom happens to be in town.  When confronted, Tyler has a fight with her mom and ""runs away"" to Katie's because her parents let her down anything she wants.The small town they live in has become the target of two somewhat stupid, but scary pair of brothers who are looking for a rich kid to kidnap for ransom.  Tyler and Katie, of course, become the targets of the bungling criminals when they realize they are alone because Katie's parents are on vacation and her big sister is out on a date.  When the police can't find them, Two-Bits and Pepper escape to find their beloved riders.  It is a dangerous mission, and it will require Two-Bits to confront his greatest fears out of love of his little girl.One side note: I don't know why the company who released this movie to DVD used the cover they did.  There is NO black horse in the movie at all!  It is also lacking subtitles, which is fairly inexcusable in this day and age.",4,"Cheesy, But Good Movie",1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,2237,"['honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'movie', 'so', 'horrible', 'very', 'clearly', 'rated', 'PG', 'so', 'why', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'intended', 'little', 'kids', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'young', 'kids', 'kidnappers', 'can', 'be', 'scary', 'not', 'much', 'worse', 'ones', 'Home', 'Alone', 'final', 'scenes', 'when', 'horses', 'go', 'rescue', 'girls', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'scary', 'though', 'again', 'no', 'more', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'PG', 'movies', 'putting', 'animals', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'Far', 'From', 'Home', 'Dinosaur', 'even', 'Bear', 'also', 'PG', 'yet', 'doubt', 'parent', 'would', 'let', 'sub-10', 'year', 'old', 'watch', 'movie', 'interesting', 'tale', 'two', 'girls', 'two', 'horses', 'Two-Bits', 'little', 'pony', 'haunted', 'nightmares', 'mother', 'being', 'killed', 'drunk', 'driver', 'who', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'young', 'result', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'insecure', 'frequently', 'barn', 'so', 'sleep', 'young', 'owner', 'Tyler', 'window', 'Pepper', 'older', 'gray', 'horse', 'owned', 'Tyler', 'family', 'always', 'ridden', 'Tyler', 'best', 'friend', 'Katie', 'little', 'rough', 'Two-Bits', 'also', 'little', 'wise', 'world', 'ready', 'listen', 'when', 'Two-Bits', 'nightmares', 'wake', 'up', 'girls', 'decide', 'ride', 'horses', 'town', 'Tyler', 'parents', 'specific', 'instructions', 'not', 'figure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'caught', 'course', 'Tyler', 'mom', 'be', 'town', 'When', 'confronted', 'Tyler', 'fight', 'mom', 'runs', 'away', 'Katie', 'parents', 'let', 'down', 'anything', 'wants.The', 'small', 'town', 'live', 'become', 'target', 'two', 'stupid', 'scary', 'pair', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'rich', 'kid', 'kidnap', 'ransom', 'Tyler', 'Katie', 'course', 'become', 'targets', 'bungling', 'criminals', 'when', 'realize', 'are', 'alone', 'Katie', 'parents', 'are', 'vacation', 'big', 'sister', 'out', 'date', 'When', 'police', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'Two-Bits', 'Pepper', 'escape', 'find', 'beloved', 'riders', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'will', 'require', 'Two-Bits', 'confront', 'greatest', 'fears', 'love', 'little', 'girl.One', 'side', 'note', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'company', 'who', 'released', 'movie', 'DVD', 'used', 'cover', 'did', 'NO', 'black', 'horse', 'movie', 'also', 'lacking', 'subtitles', 'fairly', 'inexcusable', 'day', 'age']",N/A
