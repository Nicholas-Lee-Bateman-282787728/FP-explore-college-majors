252449,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6301423941,Annie Van Auken,"[2, 2]","Scout Ed Bannon (Heston) is very loosely based on Ed Siebert, a German national who refused to learn English, instead teaching himself the Apache tongue.Featured in the cast is Frank DeKova as Chief Chattez. Fans of the 60s TV sitcomF TROOPknow him better as Chief Wild Eagle. His Native American here is naturally more subdued than the over-the-top comedy counterpart. Also here is Milburn Stone (Sandy MacKinnon)-- 'Doc' Adams on TV's longest-running western series,GUNSMOKE.SYNOPSIS--Despite the opinion of Capt. Bill North (Keith) and reassurance from Chattez that the Apache tribe will freely surrender for transport to Florida, Ed Bannon is convinced otherwise. This Apache-hater fervently believes the chief's son, Toriano (Palance) has returned from an Eastern school not to oversee his peoples' removal from ancestral lands but to fulfill a false prophesy and lead an uprisng against the 'White Eyes.'Shot in the rural Texas area where these events originally unfolded, ""Arrowhead"" is a fine cavalry/Indians saga that's enhanced by superior Technicolor cinematography, solid acting from its principals and a fast-moving script. Despite claims that this perennially underrated picture broadly stereotypes and thus denigrates the red man, taken solely as entertainment it's a darn good piece of work!

252458,A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG,6301423941,Kay's Husband,"[35, 36]","This 1953 western movie is an excellent movie for its time and for all time.The script is based on W. R. Burnett's hardcover novel, ADOBE WALLS, published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1953. The western novel by Burnett is loosely based on the life of Albert Seiber exemplar frontiersman and U.S. Army Scout in Arizona Territory during the Apache Wars of the 1880s. Much of the happenings are true to the time and true also to Al Seiber's life.Whether one cares for this movie or not, and judging by the first two reviews here they don't, any film of historical background is noteworthy. While it is true the film takes much dramatic license in many ways, if one reads on the west these items are easily spotted and do not get in the way of enjoying the movie.The setting of the movie is realistic and the use of old Fort Davis adds an aura of authenticity to the location shots. It was acceptable in those 1950 days to have non-Indians portray Indians, and at times Hollywood dared to change history. But in many respects true lore comes through in this movie, for example, the Ghost dance with its expectation of a 'messiah' to lead in the extermination of the white man, and dancing to make the Indians impervious to bullets, and the attempt to dance back the bison and the good times, all have their basis in historical fact.The plot also involves double dealing by some Apache Scouts, and while most were very trustworthy, a few were not and some ending up being hung.  The Apache Kid turned renegade and was able to elude capture, with no white ever knowing how he ended up.  Even the attempt to relocate the Apache out of the territory to Florida did in fact occur. So while there is much fiction in this movie, there is also much fact.If one has some knowledge of the west, or just plain enjoys an interesting movie of the west, the viewer should do 'ok' watching it.But again, as evidenced by the first two reviews here, a movie sometimes just doesn't meet everyone's expectations.Semper Fi.",5,Army Scouts & Apache Warriors,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,1992,"['1953', 'western', 'movie', 'excellent', 'movie', 'time', 'time.The', 'script', 'based', 'W.', 'R.', 'Burnett', 'hardcover', 'novel', 'ADOBE', 'WALLS', 'published', 'Alfred', 'A.', 'Knopf', '1953', 'western', 'novel', 'Burnett', 'loosely', 'based', 'life', 'Albert', 'Seiber', 'exemplar', 'frontiersman', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Scout', 'Arizona', 'Territory', 'Apache', 'Wars', '1880s', 'Much', 'happenings', 'are', 'true', 'time', 'true', 'also', 'Al', 'Seiber', 'life.Whether', 'one', 'movie', 'not', 'judging', 'first', 'two', 'reviews', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'film', 'historical', 'background', 'noteworthy', 'true', 'film', 'much', 'dramatic', 'license', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'reads', 'west', 'items', 'are', 'easily', 'spotted', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'enjoying', 'movie.The', 'setting', 'movie', 'realistic', 'use', 'old', 'Fort', 'Davis', 'aura', 'authenticity', 'location', 'shots', 'was', 'acceptable', '1950', 'days', 'have', 'non-Indians', 'portray', 'Indians', 'times', 'Hollywood', 'dared', 'change', 'history', 'many', 'respects', 'true', 'lore', 'through', 'movie', 'example', 'Ghost', 'dance', 'expectation', ""'messiah"", 'lead', 'extermination', 'white', 'man', 'dancing', 'make', 'Indians', 'impervious', 'bullets', 'attempt', 'dance', 'back', 'bison', 'good', 'times', 'have', 'basis', 'historical', 'fact.The', 'plot', 'also', 'double', 'dealing', 'Apache', 'Scouts', 'most', 'were', 'very', 'trustworthy', 'few', 'were', 'not', 'ending', 'up', 'being', 'hung', 'Apache', 'Kid', 'turned', 'renegade', 'was', 'able', 'elude', 'capture', 'white', 'ever', 'knowing', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'Even', 'attempt', 'relocate', 'Apache', 'territory', 'Florida', 'did', 'fact', 'occur', 'So', 'much', 'fiction', 'movie', 'also', 'much', 'fact.If', 'one', 'knowledge', 'west', 'just', 'plain', 'interesting', 'movie', 'west', 'viewer', 'should', 'do', ""'ok"", 'watching', 'it.But', 'again', 'evidenced', 'first', 'two', 'reviews', 'here', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'just', ""n't"", 'meet', 'everyone', 'expectations.Semper', 'Fi']",Arrowhead VHS

252460,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6301423941,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","Although not a masterpiece, this is nevertheless an interesting and highly original western - and I liked it a lot. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.The film begins with a short skirmish between two army scouts, including Chief Scout Ed Bannon (Charlton Heston), and two Apache warriors. This incident is considered as extremely unwelcome by local US Cavalry commanders, as it seems that most of Apache tribes are now looking for a peaceful settlement. Local settlers are weary of years of war and are ready to go to great lengths to achieve peace.In fact, mixed blood half-Apaches, like a smoking hot girl named Nita (Katy Jurado) and her brother Spanish (Peter Coe) live already amongst the whites. Some young Apaches went also to white man schools to be educated and help build bridges between communities. The greatest hope for everybody in those lands is Toriano (Jack Palance), a very gifted and charismatic young man, son of an influent Apache chief, who obtained a scholarship and went to the college in East. Having recently graduated he is now due to come back, to the greatest joy of his fellow tribesmen but also many whites, many of whom were raised together with him (one of them is even his blood brother)...But there is a shadow on this idyllic picture. Chief Scout Ed Bannon doesn't buy it all. He believes that this whole recent period of calm is just silence before the storm and all gestures of good will shown by Apaches are just a game. Bannon claims that Apaches are in fact preparing a major rebellion, one which will unite more tribes than ever before - and he even believes that fully  assimilated and well educated (in fact better educated than Bannon himself) Toriano is the brain behind all this master plan...Bannon, a highly experienced scout and veteran of many fights, who himself lived many years amongst the Apache and knows their language and customs, seems on the surface of things as somebody whose advice should count. But as what he says goes against the desires of local population and authorities, both military and civilians, absolutely everybody is outraged and incensed by what is considered as &#34;warmongering&#34;.It must be said, that Bannon is not a very nice fellow - to put things mildly... He has a short temper and bad  manners, he completely lacks diplomacy and he also has the reputation of mistreating women, especially his half-blood mistress, Nita. Many cavalry soldiers also dislike him because he used to be a Confederate officer&#8230; As nobody is as blind as those who refuse to see, when Bannon discovers some evidence supporting his views, paradoxically it makes things even worse for him - he gets assaulted and beaten... Ultimately cavalry commanders order him to step down for a time from his functions and stay away from Indians, to avoid any further incidents, which could jeopardize peace process.All this covers like the first ten minutes - and then the film REALLY begins and about the rest I will say no more...This film is an adaptation of the novel &#34;Adobe walls&#34; by W. R. Burnett, an American novelist who wrote many books adapted later to the screen, including &#34;Little Caesar&#34;, &#34;The beast of the City&#34;, &#34;High Sierra&#34; and &#34;Asphalt Jungle&#34;. He also later wrote the scenario for &#34;The Great Escape&#34;.The title of the book was quite appropriate, as adobe walls are indeed fragile &#8211; and can collapse easily&#8230; The title of the film however doesn't seem to have much to do with anything on the screen &#8211; except if one can consider Toriano as the sharp business end of the whole arrow made of hundreds of Apaches&#8230;The character of Ed Bannon was supposedly inspired by that of Al Sieber, a real life famous scout who after fighting for the North in War Between States served later under general Crook in Apache Wars &#8211; but after reading a short biography of Siebert I really couldn't find ANY significant similarities, except for the fact that both are scouts and fought against Indians.This film is sometimes criticised for a very negative perception it gives of the Apaches (both full blooded and half-breeds), as it shows them as scheming, treacherous and especially EXTREMELY violent and cruel. Well, after reading some books about Apache Wars, I must say that I believe this film portrays them EXACTLY as they were &#8211; essentially very warlike Palaeolithic nomadic hunter-gatherers, who despised all peaceful trades like farming or cattle raising and based a large part of their economy and culture on raiding, looting and enslaving their less violent neighbours.Well before any white people came, Apaches were already a scourge of those Indian tribes which opted for more sedentary and less warlike lifestyle &#8211; and it had consequence for their whole social life. Warlike nomadic populations which adopt predatory comportments are usually very proud, fierce and arrogant and tend to use cruelty as ways to scare and impress their prey. Furthermore, in those kind of societies the use of deceit, schemes and betrayal is also considered as a perfectly honourable way to act against &#34;lesser&#34; nations &#8211; which means all those with which such a group is currently at war&#8230;To finish with the subject of deceit and treachery &#8211; although viciously cruel and violent, the Apaches were however fighting for their own land during their wars against USA and Mexico governments and as they couldn't match American and Mexican armies firepower, I can hardly blame them for using guerrilla tactics, &#34;ruses de guerre&#34;, infiltration, double-agents and occasional perfidy&#8230;That being said, I believe in this film the Apache are just a tool used to make a larger demonstration. The novel &#34;Adobe Walls&#34; was written in 1953, when Korean War was still raging. Because of that  everybody still remembered how badly United States wanted peace after 1945 and how quickly the country disarmed &#8211; just to be taken completely by surprise when Stalin send his North Korean stooge against South Korea in 1950&#8230;I believe that both the novel and the film address actually two issues revealed by Korean War. The first one is the voluntary blindness to the gathering clouds of war of people who, tired of fighting, desperately want peace. But to achieve peace it takes BOTH sides &#8211; and if one is really committed to wage war, then there WILL BE war, no matter what conciliatory measures the other one takes&#8230; The second issue is an aggressive and hostile reaction to people who say uncomfortable truths, which disturb the peace of mind of majority &#8211; especially when those seemingly wolf-crying naysayers are not very popular or for that matter very likeable to begin with&#8230; And yet, even the nastiest @holes can sometimes be right &#8211; and even if there is no reason nor obligation to like them, it can be not such a bad idea to at least check if they are not on to something real after all&#8230;For all reasons mentioned above I consider &#34;Arrowhead&#34; as a very, very interesting film with a much deeper and complex scenario than one can think. I must however admit, that the very ending is anti-climactic and surprisingly weak &#8211; and therefore I cannot rate this film more than four stars. Still, it is a recommended viewing and I will keep preciously my DVD. Enjoy!",4,"A nasty @hole keeps saying unpopular, disturbing things and everybody HATES him.

Ed has a fierce hatred for the Apache Indian which dates as far back as his childhood.  The movie starts out with Ed killing some go-between Indians who come in peace to relay a message that the tribe is surrendering.  Ed belongs to the US Army and is kicked out for the aforementioned action by Captain Bill North, played by Brian Keith.  Keith does a great job in his role, at times sounding like John Wayne but never carrying it out quite as coolly or confidently.Captain North and his men are tasked with taking the Apaches to an Indian reservation in Florida.  However, it?s not going to be so easy thanks to Apache Toriano, played by Jack Palance.  The Captain thinks he and his men can pull off this feat without much trouble, but can they, without help from Bannon?  After all, he's lived with the Apache and knows how they think.This film doesn?t really have any good nor bad characters although at the time it came out the Apaches were the bad guys, why else would they cast Palance as Toriano?  It?s an interesting film from a historical perspective (film history, not actual history) but much finer &quot;cowboy&quot; vs. Indians have been created.  In today?s world the movie?s very un-PC, but weren?t most early films starring Native American bigoted in some way?",2,Heston vs Palance should have been more exciting.,1068508800,"11 11, 2003",2003,1350,"['Charlton', 'Heston', 'Ed', 'Bannon', 'role', 'NRA', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'Ed', 'fierce', 'hatred', 'Apache', 'Indian', 'far', 'back', 'childhood', 'movie', 'out', 'Ed', 'killing', 'go-between', 'Indians', 'who', 'come', 'peace', 'relay', 'message', 'tribe', 'surrendering', 'Ed', 'US', 'Army', 'kicked', 'out', 'aforementioned', 'action', 'Captain', 'Bill', 'North', 'played', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'Keith', 'great', 'job', 'role', 'times', 'sounding', 'John', 'Wayne', 'never', 'carrying', 'out', 'quite', 'coolly', 'confidently.Captain', 'North', 'men', 'are', 'tasked', 'taking', 'Apaches', 'Indian', 'reservation', 'Florida', 'However', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'thanks', 'Apache', 'Toriano', 'played', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'Captain', 'men', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'feat', 'much', 'trouble', 'can', 'help', 'Bannon', 'lived', 'Apache', 'how', 'think.This', 'film', 'doesn', 't', 'really', 'have', 'good', 'bad', 'characters', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'Apaches', 'were', 'bad', 'guys', 'why', 'else', 'would', 'cast', 'Palance', 'Toriano', 's', 'interesting', 'film', 'historical', 'perspective', 'film', 'history', 'not', 'actual', 'history', 'much', 'finer', 'quot', 'cowboy', 'quot', 'vs.', 'Indians', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'today', 's', 'world', 'movie', 's', 'very', 'un-PC', 'weren', 't', 'most', 'early', 'films', 'starring', 'Native', 'American', 'bigoted', 'way']",Arrowhead VHS

Charlton Heston plays the moody Chief of Indian Scouts, Brian Keith the young and nave commander of a small unit of cavalry isolated out on the west Texas border sometime in the 1870s, and Jack Palance is college-educated Apache who comes back to the reservation with revolt, and personal glory, on his mind in ARROWHEAD, a cowboys-and-indians western from 1953.A cowboys-and-indians western with an attitude, it should be noted.  Not all that pleasant an attitude, either.  The US Government, through Keith, wants to parlay with the Apaches.  Heston, who grew up with `em and can read a pony trail or a smoke signal like a native, will have none of it. To Heston - and the movie, because Heston is never proven wrong - the Apaches are treacherous, back-stabbing fiends whose perfidious ways are etched in their genes.  He's not a hater, though.  In fact, at one point he clears that point up by saying  ""I don't hate `em, I know `em.""  Put that in your peace pipe and smoke it!  My favorite line in this odd movie, though, is again uttered by Heston when a character he was on intimate terms with dies (after unsuccessfully trying to stab him in the back) by her own hands when she turns her knife on herself.  You'd think this movie would be the least little curious about what motivated this sequence of events beyond the ""Apache blood"" excuse it uses throughout, but no.  So, fresh corpse on the floor, fresh corpse of a recently intimate acquaintance, and the movie has Heston say, with undisguised disgust, `There's a dead Apache in here.  Get it out.'  It's amazing to think that this one came out AFTER ""Broken Arrow,"" the landmark Jimmy Stewart/Delmer Daves film from 1950 that is usually credited with opening up movies to a sympathetic treatment of Native Americans.A trend that wasn't stemmed much by this pretty much forgotten little oater.  If you can get past the movie's mean and narrow point of view it's an alright actioner.  Heston plays it with cool authority, gets to keep a couple of fort women on the string, and plumbs absolutely none of the psychological depths his Apache-raised character is filled with (to be fair, the movie doesn't seem much interested in whatever conflicts his character is experiencing, either.)  Jack Palance, one of the more sinister actors in movie history, is very effective as the war-minded Apache.
