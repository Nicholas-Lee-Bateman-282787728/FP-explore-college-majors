It's beautiful to look at. It is educational on many fronts, from psychology to politics. The music is wonderful. Brilliant pleasure. I will see it again with loved ones, including the Gringo grandchildren. It was on Cinemax in HD. There should be a Blu-ray issued. I will buy the dvd from Amazon as a gift.",5,So good and so good for you... wonderful,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,441,"['What', 'healthy', 'experience', 'am', 'developing', 'affection', 'Mexico', 'really', 'hit', 'spot', 'story', 'great', 'beautiful', 'look', 'educational', 'many', 'fronts', 'psychology', 'politics', 'music', 'wonderful', 'Brilliant', 'pleasure', 'will', 'see', 'again', 'loved', 'ones', 'including', 'Gringo', 'grandchildren', 'was', 'Cinemax', 'HD', 'should', 'be', 'Blu-ray', 'issued', 'will', 'buy', 'dvd', 'Amazon', 'gift']",Mariachi Gringo

The ending was rather odd. both characters follow their dreams but it's not presented very well.

1652056,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00CYLRQDW,Grady Harp,"[7, 7]","EL MARIACHI GRINGO is a little film with a quiet but sincere message. It is obviously a low budget film based on a screenplay by Cory Krueckenberg and directed sympathetically by Tom Gustafson, both men rather new to these two role assignments. The reason the film works is the sense of honesty about it.The film opens in Kansas were life is rather boring, especially for a 30-year-old young man Edward (Shawn Ashmore), on some medication for what seems to be a form of mental illness, who still lives with his parents (Kate Burton and Tom Wopat) and has not found a direction for his life.  He has studied music, plays the guitar occasionally, and one day he wanders into a town Mexican restaurant called El Mariachi where he is befriended by Rosario (Yareli Arizmendi) and Alberto (Fernando Becerril) who plays guitar and sings to the customers. Alberto shares his basement model of the city of Guadalajara where he recalls singing with the Mariachis in Mariachi Square who simply make a living singing for the people to help them celebrate their lives. Edward absorbs the dream of playing music for the people, takes lessons in Mariachi from Alberto, settles with his disapproving parents, and is off to Mexico. At first out of place in Guadalajara he soon meets Lilia (the very beautiful and talented Martha Higareda) working in her mother Magdalena's (Adriana Barraza) caf&eacute;. With Lilia (who had studied in Santa Cruz, CA and longs to go back to her dream) and Mariachi singer Sophia (Lila Downs) he is introduced to the field of real Mariachi singing, becomes accepted as the Gringo Mariachi, wins some fame, but after a brief trip back to Kansas for an unexpected funeral, Edward returns to Guadlajara to find things have changed - but he still has followed his dream and is quietly happy.There are significant subplots that aren't well explored, but the film does not try to be anything it isn't - it is just about following your dreams no matter the obstacles or consequences or surprises. The cast is competent, the music is a highlight, and the take away feeling is one of tenderness and caring.

There were some humorous parts too but it's prettty much a drama about a man finding himself in a very unlikely place. The story's fun and will make you want to go to Mexico to hear the wonderful music yourself. For the music ,to me, is the real draw in the film. There is some great Mariachi songs and lots of Lila Downs. She's amazing and really gets a chance to show her talents as a singer of Mexican songs. If you are a Lila Downs fan you will want to own this film. I hope she has the opportunity to act and sing more films. She does both very well.",4,Great story and Lila Downs!,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,631,"['When', 'first', 'read', 'title', 'also', 'was', 'thinking', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'comedy', 'were', 'humorous', 'parts', 'too', 'prettty', 'much', 'drama', 'man', 'finding', 'very', 'unlikely', 'place', 'story', 'fun', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'Mexico', 'hear', 'wonderful', 'music', 'music', 'real', 'draw', 'film', 'great', 'Mariachi', 'songs', 'lots', 'Lila', 'Downs', 'amazing', 'really', 'chance', 'show', 'talents', 'singer', 'Mexican', 'songs', 'are', 'Lila', 'Downs', 'fan', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'film', 'hope', 'opportunity', 'act', 'sing', 'more', 'films', 'very', 'well']",Mariachi Gringo

If your a fan of Lila Downs I would recommend you watch this movie.  And not to mention just to hear the main actor sing was incredible.

This is a film about an American who wanted to play the guitar in a mariachi band and got  his chance in Guadalajara, Mexico, the home of mariachi music.My cat Monkey is a big fan of Mexican music and will sit on my lap for hours listening to the music. The film Mariachi Gringo features my favorite Mexico singer from Oaxaca, Lila Downs, whose voice we hear in the film Frida, which tells the story of Frida Kahlo. Lila's mother is a full blooded Mixteca Indian and her father is a professor from the University of Minnesota. She has  released many CDs and DVDs and has given concerts in Spain and France.This film is humorous and has won many awards.
