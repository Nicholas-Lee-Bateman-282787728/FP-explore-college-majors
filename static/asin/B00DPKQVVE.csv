1660414,A35IW20X5N3CEB,B00DPKQVVE,Novelwit2000,"[0, 0]","When I set out to write this review, there were a LOT of things that I wanted to say.One of them, being the fact that this very hard working band found themselves in this whole big mess--that they were being sued by their record label due to 'breach of contract'.What also struck me was the part when Jared Leto (in a voice-over) explained how a typical record deal is structured.  I'll tell you, it's a LOT to take in, with me scratching my head at the part where the record label gets to take an 85% cut out of the profits. (And that will be in addition to other things--that Jared goes into length about explaining.)I mean, I'm thinking 85%?  That's virtually EVERYTHING. And why???  So the execs can continue to afford their comfortable lifestyles.  Or is it to make payroll?This part of the story (that does NOT get answered) remains a mystery.Anyway, what doesn't remain a mystery is the fact that Jared, along with his brother Shannon and their bandmate Tomo, really work hard and really care about the music they make.I mean, the documentary really shows how hard all of them work, to the point where you see Jared working in his pajamas!I mean, from what I got to see, these guys have NOT gone Hollywood.  (I don't even think they have any interest in all of that--wherein you're going to see them boozing it out and falling apart and NOT keeping their end of the bargain.)I mean, what's GREAT evidence of their work ethic, is that they are in the Guiness Book of World Records for having the longest tour of a rock band. I tell you, you can't have that kind of record being a screw-up!Overall, the documentary says a lot. For me, the most compelling were the parts where you got to know Jared and Shannon when they were coming up. That insight, was the REAL gift.The movie is truly a document of a band trying to do the right thing, looking for their label to do the same with them.And in the end, what's so wrong with that?I mean, really what is the problem folks???Watch and enjoy!!!",5,"...sometimes you gotta fight to be free.
