When I saw this video, I thought that it would be interesting to watch, as most of Jerry's 'clip shows' tend to be pretty funny.When the video arrived, I watched it and laughed my butt off.  I especially liked the part where the guy and his 'chunky' wife got into it and started throwing food at each other.I was really shocked the first time someone swore because I'm so used to the censor taking all of that out.  After that, the cussing didn't even phase me.The extra 10 minuts of 'bonus footage' at the end really isn't all that great.  Just some out-takes.If you've had a bad day at work, or a fight with a family member, watch this video and think ""Thank goodness, my life could be worse.

442620,A3CM1CDUSWYDIO,6304982747,Christopher Schmitz,"[8, 10]","Jerry Springer, along with that other Jerry (Seinfeld), ranks as one of the great comedians of 90s television, and he does so by playing a straight man to a stageful of trailer park trash soap opera.  At any given point, there are no more than 11 teeth among the guests, even if an entire family is being torn apart by someone's hortisexual affair with a trailing hibiscus.Springer's stage is Darwin's waiting room, the shallow end of the gene pool.  These people are not even pond scum.  They aspire to be pond scum ONE DAY.  I mean if they really work at it!

442622,A2LNEZD3YBO12O,6304982747,Preston,"[1, 3]","I saw this DVD and found it very mediocre.  Jerry Springer's show at its highest peak in 1997 and 1998 had nonstop fighting from guests confronting each other, who are angry at each other and the audience is cheering them on.  Mostly the guests were people in bad relationships, yet needed to go on TV to vent their frustration.  The show's still on in 2005, yet I feel that it's run out of topics or things to talk about. Springer and his producers have overdone it by a third on its current 15th season. If that's true, then how come the shows that Steve Wilkos, the show's security guard, hosts are better that the ones that Jerry hosts? Maybe Steve should host his own talk show instead. Yet this DVD is a mangled mess of chair hurling, hair pulling, guests wrestling on the floor and so forth.  All over issues such as infidelity and cheating on the other man or woman. Yes, there is an audience for these kinds of confrontational talk shows, but does it have to take five security guards to break up two fighting guests? Something's really wrong right there! I don't know how anybody can get through any of those segments--it's exhausting and painful to watch in one setting!

These are the same people who scoff at pro wrestling as being ""fake"". Here's news, folks: The Jerry Springer Show is SCRIPTED. ALL of it. COMPLETELY fake. I have several friends who appeared on the show (they are actors) and played a part. They were told what to portray, and how to play the part.This doesn't eliminate the entertainment value of the show, however. Pro wrestling is entertaining even though it is scripted, the same is true of Springer. Just realize that what you are watching isn't real, and never has been.
