How to Fall in Love was really quite clean.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and bought it as soon as it came to DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.Every time Harold White asks a woman out it ends in disaster. He still suffers from an &#34;ugly-duckling syndrome&#34; in his youth that has haunted him ever since.  He thinks that he hasn't changed all that much.  However, Annie, the pretty/popular girl he knew and had a crush on in high school (who he asked out once and she didn't pay much attention to) meets him again and wants him to hire her to be his dating coach (and help him gain some self-esteem).  It is very cute how Annie draws Harold out of his shell and teaches him about who he is and who he wants to be.  Lesson #1: Self-Confidence. Lesson #2: Breaking the Ice.  Lesson #3: The Art of Conversation.  Lesson #4: Start Sharing.  Lesson #5: Make Her Feel Special.  Lesson #6: Getting Close.  Lesson #7: Compromise.  Lesson #8: Follow Your Heart.  She thinks she is helping him to ask out the girl he has seen in the coffee shop, but Harold still likes his &#34;teacher&#34; and as Annie gets to know her &#34;student&#34; better, they find that they like their lives so much more with each other in it.

1596843,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B009INAC12,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[50, 50]","To my shame - for I am a manly man - I find myself hooked on the Hallmark Channel. To offset those times when I'm out chopping wood or whittling with my Bowie knife or recaulking stuff, I sometimes take my ease by taking in diverting romantic comedy films like 2012's HOW TO FALL IN LOVE. Eric Mabius and Brooke D'Orsay star in this one and you're probably having the same reaction I did: ""Who the heck are they?"" I had never heard of Mabius & D'Orsay - they sound like a French magic act or an occult detective agency - but it's okay. We navigate thru what could've been a pedestrian narrative made exceedingly watchable, thanks to fine performances by Mabius & D'Orsay. Or if we don't care about hurting Eric Mabius's feelings, thanks mostly to Brooke D'Orsay.The plot revolves around a painfully shy accountant who hires a dating coach to help him gain self-confidence. Except that this fledgling dating coach, Annie Hayes (D'Orsay), turns out to be the same girl on whom Harold White (Mabius) once had a crush years ago in high school. Harold, back during his formative years, was a social misfit. And, distressingly, Harold has never outgrown his awkward teenhood. It's depressing when your local waitress greets you with this sort of familiarity: ""Let me guess. Table for one, right?"" So that's Harold's plight. He makes Rainman seem like a wild bon vivant.Not that the ""dating coach"" has got her sh-- together. Annie Hayes is an event planner by day, but times are lean, and so she supplements that by waitressing. Annie by nature is happy-go-lucky and seems stuck in inertia and relies on her older sister's good graces. Except that her sister has dropped an ultimatum. She wants Annie to move out already. To further supplement her low income, Annie offers to be Harold's dating coach, never mind that she'd never done this before. And either Harold is a soft touch or he's still smitten with his high school crush, because he hires her.Come the eight lessons on dating, spanning germane topics such as ""gaining self-confidence,"" ""breaking the ice"" and ""the art of conversation."" And as Annie reshapes her client from a cripplingly shy wallflower into a self-assured bachelor, are you so surprised that she begins to develop feelings for him? It turns out, there's more to Harold White than endless social mortification.HOW TO FALL IN LOVE holds no great revelation. It's another modern spin on Pygmalion, this time with a gender reversal. I feel that this is more a vehicle for the immensely appealing Brooke D'Orsay. She shines as the rudderless young woman who gradually comes of age. She provides the vitality and the personality. And maybe it's because I'm a guy, but it seems to me that Eric Mabius's character, even when finally having achieved ""hunk"" status, still comes off as bland. He makes Lawrence Welk seem daring and hip. But I approve of Harold White's taste in music. Props to him for championing the likes of Ella Fitzgerald and Tony Bennett and Deano. And I really enjoyed the interactions between Mabius and D'Orsay (""Mabius & D'Orsay - Your Upscale Haberdashers!""). This is a predictable movie, but sweet and a lot of fun. It provides a welcome change of pace from blacksmithing and beer brewing, manly pursuits which always wear me out.",4,"""Okay, Harold, if you're gonna be my lump of clay, I need you to be a little bit less of a lump.""",1360368000,"02 9, 2013",2013,3267,"['shame', 'am', 'manly', 'man', 'find', 'hooked', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'offset', 'times', 'when', ""'m"", 'out', 'chopping', 'wood', 'whittling', 'Bowie', 'knife', 'recaulking', 'stuff', 'sometimes', 'take', 'ease', 'taking', 'diverting', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'films', '2012', 'HOW', 'TO', 'FALL', 'IN', 'LOVE', 'Eric', 'Mabius', 'Brooke', ""D'Orsay"", 'star', 'one', ""'re"", 'probably', 'having', 'same', 'reaction', 'did', 'Who', 'heck', 'are', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Mabius', ""D'Orsay"", 'sound', 'French', 'magic', 'act', 'occult', 'detective', 'agency', 'okay', 'navigate', 'thru', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pedestrian', 'narrative', 'made', 'exceedingly', 'watchable', 'thanks', 'fine', 'performances', 'Mabius', ""D'Orsay"", 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'hurting', 'Eric', 'Mabius', 'feelings', 'thanks', 'mostly', 'Brooke', ""D'Orsay.The"", 'plot', 'around', 'painfully', 'shy', 'accountant', 'who', 'dating', 'coach', 'help', 'gain', 'self-confidence', 'fledgling', 'dating', 'coach', 'Annie', 'Hayes', ""D'Orsay"", 'out', 'be', 'same', 'girl', 'whom', 'Harold', 'White', 'Mabius', 'once', 'had', 'crush', 'years', 'ago', 'high', 'school', 'Harold', 'back', 'formative', 'years', 'was', 'social', 'misfit', 'distressingly', 'Harold', 'never', 'outgrown', 'awkward', 'teenhood', 'depressing', 'when', 'local', 'waitress', 'greets', 'sort', 'familiarity', 'Let', 'guess', 'Table', 'one', 'right', 'Harold', 'plight', 'Rainman', 'seem', 'wild', 'bon', 'vivant.Not', 'dating', 'coach', 'got', 'sh', 'together', 'Annie', 'Hayes', 'event', 'planner', 'day', 'times', 'are', 'lean', 'so', 'waitressing', 'Annie', 'nature', 'happy-go-lucky', 'stuck', 'inertia', 'relies', 'older', 'sister', 'good', 'graces', 'sister', 'dropped', 'ultimatum', 'Annie', 'move', 'out', 'already', 'further', 'supplement', 'low', 'income', 'Annie', 'be', 'Harold', 'dating', 'coach', 'never', 'mind', ""'d"", 'never', 'done', 'before', 'Harold', 'soft', 'touch', 'still', 'smitten', 'high', 'school', 'crush', 'eight', 'lessons', 'dating', 'spanning', 'germane', 'topics', 'such', 'gaining', 'self-confidence', 'breaking', 'ice', 'art', 'conversation', 'Annie', 'client', 'cripplingly', 'shy', 'wallflower', 'self-assured', 'bachelor', 'are', 'so', 'surprised', 'develop', 'feelings', 'out', 'more', 'Harold', 'White', 'endless', 'social', 'mortification.HOW', 'TO', 'FALL', 'IN', 'LOVE', 'great', 'revelation', 'modern', 'spin', 'Pygmalion', 'time', 'gender', 'reversal', 'feel', 'more', 'vehicle', 'immensely', 'appealing', 'Brooke', ""D'Orsay"", 'rudderless', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'gradually', 'age', 'vitality', 'personality', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'guy', 'Eric', 'Mabius', 'character', 'even', 'when', 'finally', 'having', 'achieved', 'hunk', 'status', 'still', 'off', 'bland', 'Lawrence', 'Welk', 'seem', 'daring', 'hip', 'approve', 'Harold', 'White', 'taste', 'music', 'Props', 'championing', 'likes', 'Ella', 'Fitzgerald', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'Deano', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'interactions', 'Mabius', ""D'Orsay"", 'Mabius', ""D'Orsay"", 'Upscale', 'Haberdashers', 'predictable', 'movie', 'sweet', 'lot', 'fun', 'welcome', 'change', 'pace', 'blacksmithing', 'beer', 'brewing', 'manly', 'always', 'wear', 'out']",How to Fall in Love

Olsen,"[3, 5]","This is a favorite of the recent Hallmark Channel offerings.Here is a guy who, though a successful and creative adult, can't see himself as anything more than the awkward, geeky teen of his younger days. He is attracted to a woman that he sees in a coffee shop regularly, but hasn't got the self-assurance to approach her. Encouraged by a friend, he goes to a dating coach, which turns out to be not such a good idea.Enter a ghost from his past--one that has never stopped haunting him. This ghost is a young woman he knew in high school. We have already witnessed, in flashback form, his painful encounter with her at a school dance. She now seems oblivious to his angst over their former acquaintance. In fact, she can't even remember that they had gone to a dance together. But she needs to find work, and when Harold confesses to still being socially inept and mentions his failed attempt with a dating coach, she decides that is a job she could take on.Her goal is to help him learn how to approach and successfully date the woman in the coffee shop, and she takes it on with all of her might!This may be a typical ugly duckling story, but it is done with creativity and humor and I found it very enjoyable. The characters are endearing, and it is a delightful journey to watch the unfolding of Harold's confidence and the development of his coach's awareness of who it is she is coaching.

Annie's self analysis and growth really impressed me, probably more than Harold's story. I also think the 8 lessons that Annie teaches Harold are decent advice and definitely won't hurt any relationship or individual.I found the dramatics with Annie and her sister, Harold's hoped for girlfriend, and the dorky best friend too much the cookie cutter Hallmark supporting cast.  I would have liked it better if they had toned it down a notch.  I knew that Harold was not going to end up with Julie, I didn't need her to overact her obnoxious behavior to get it.So go into this one knowing that it does fall into the category of sappy TV romance shows.

The whole boy meet girl story is thrown in by having this guy meet the girl when they were in high school. Then, years later, they re-meet and he hires her as a dating coach.Now, you know it coming, but you keep watching to see it, when they both fall in love with each other. Oh yes, you know it by the cover only! So, after they start having their dating coach seasons, they start really loving each other, but neither of them really want to admit it. This is because the whole point is for the guy to find another girl to date. So, it is not possible for the main guy or main girl to love each other, while the guy is trying to find love with another girl.Again, you know it coming, and it will come when the fall out happens that the two main stars will love each other.
