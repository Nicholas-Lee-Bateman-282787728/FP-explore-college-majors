Taylor ""GFT""","[23, 24]","Scooby Doo and the gang may have hit the big screen, but this is the real stuff: the original Saturday morning cartoon series that so many of us grew up with. And although we might say we got this for our kids, the truth is that even as grown-ups we're addicted to these cartoon Scooby snacks ourselves!This particular DVD offers the first five episodes in the series, each one running just under half an hour. ""What a Night for a Knight"" finds the gang investigating a suit of armor that comes to life during the full moon. When their ship run aground on a spooky island, the gang visits a creepy castle in ""Hassle in the Castle""--and encounters a ghost! ""A Clue for Scooby Doo"" concerns a ghostly scuba diver; ""Mine Your Own Business"" has the gang investigating 'the miner forty-niner' that haunts an old gold mine; and ""Decoy for a Dognapper"" finds Scooby himself dognapped and the gang searching an abandoned Indian village to find him. And you'll find all the stereotypes here: crazy clues, frantic chases, and the ""ghosts"" are NEVER real!The animation is pretty flat, the music is 1969 wannabe funky, the plots are loose and pretty silly--no one would ever accuse the series of being great art. But it has tremendous nostalgic appeal. The episodes seen here have not been restored, but to my mind the scratches, blips, and dust spots just add to the sense of watching an old favorite.

The mystery, the atmosphere etc.  These are all great episodes except the reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 is the most obnoxious thing about this DVD.The laugh track they have just about kills the enjoyment of watching these.  It is more obvious in some of the episodes, like 'Mine You Own Business"", where it seems like every time any of the characters says a word, you get this cheesy overbearing laugh track.  It almost ruins it totally for me.  Scooby says hello, here comes the laughs.  I don't know, if you can get by this as an adult, no problem.  The kids probably won't mind, but some may.Needless to say, the episodes are still what they are and you'll enjoy them for what they are.  Good fun.On a side note, I wish we could see seasons of Scooby Doo and not an episode here and there put on a DVD.",4,"Love Scooby Doo, Don't Love Laugh Track!!!",1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,933,"['watched', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'late', '70', 'kid', 'loved', 'still', 'do', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'age', 'great', 'cartoon', 'mystery', 'atmosphere', 'etc', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', 'reason', 'put', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'thing', 'DVD.The', 'laugh', 'track', 'have', 'just', 'about', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'more', 'obvious', 'episodes', 'Own', 'Business', 'where', 'time', 'characters', 'word', 'get', 'cheesy', 'overbearing', 'laugh', 'track', 'almost', 'totally', 'Scooby', 'hello', 'here', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'get', 'adult', 'problem', 'kids', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'may.Needless', 'say', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'what', 'are', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'what', 'are', 'Good', 'fun.On', 'side', 'note', 'wish', 'could', 'see', 'seasons', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'not', 'episode', 'here', 'there', 'put', 'DVD']",Scooby-Doo's Original Mysteries

I've been watching Scooby cartoons for at least 25 years now, and I still can't get enough of them. Scooby is the favorite cartoon of both of my children, which just freaks me out. This DVD has the first five episodes of Scooby Doo. They made their television debut in 1969, and 32 years later, they are my children's favorite cartoons. There really isn't much else to say.
