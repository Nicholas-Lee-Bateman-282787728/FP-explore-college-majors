970780,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000E97HX0,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[3, 9]","""Bailey's Billions"" is a silly family comedy about a dog who suddenly finds himself rich beyond imagination when his owner leaves him the bulk of her billion- plus dollar inheritance. Once the news is announced by the owner herself via a video, two of the other family members who expected to receive a much larger sum of money than they did proceed to develop a plot to get rid of Bailey and get the inheritance for themselves- a typical reaction and a typical direction for a movie with this type of plot to take.The plot of this movie is a simple one and it never moves very far beyond a few silly laughs and a few stupid gags. To add a little more to the entertainment, Bailey and the other dogs in the movie actually talk and their mouths move in a manner that is similar to a human's mouth. Jon Lovitz supplies the voice for Bailey and the things Bailey says are usually sarcastic when he is talking about the people around him. Bailey's tone changes a little bit when his eyes are cast upon a cute female pooch, turning him into a smooth talking canine with a taste for romance. But other than that, his wit is sarcastic and more often than not, it isn't very humorous or very clever.Performances in this movie are average at best, below average at worst. The only performers that are worth any mention at all are Dean Cain and Laurie Holden. They are believable in their roles, even if they both seem a little awkward. Part of the plot of this movie is a budding romance between the shy, nerdy Cain and the more confident, self- assured Holden. This doesn't really play much into the main plot of the film and it probably could have been excluded. But Holden is at least cute enough to make these scenes tolerable.Other performances are not so memorable. The members of the greedy couple trying to get Bailey's money- played by Tim Curry and Jennifer Tilly- perform poorly and even though they are two of the key people in the movie, they add little to it because they both seem so fake. And Jennifer Tilly's character is annoying to the max because of her constant chattering. She doesn't know when to take a cue from her husband or others around her and shut her big mouth. The lame attempts at comedy are forced, and even the attempts at wit by the dogs are stupid- the type of comedy anyone over seven years of age would find lame. I found myself shaking my head more than anything, wondering what the director was thinking when he created this mess.The idea behind this movie isn't anything original but it could have still been successful with a little more details and a more believable plot and cast. Instead, the director tried to keep this movie more on the juvenile side and in doing so, he ruined most any chance for it becoming a memorable motion picture. The rating on this movie is NR, but I have also seen it listed with a G rating. Even with a G rating, the directing could have been done in a way that would make the film more interesting without being offensive. But David Devine took the easy way out, keeping the film silly and shallow with nothing very memorable.I like dogs and I often enjoy movies that feature dogs in the main roles. But ""Bailey's Billions"" is a flop- a film that manages to make a breed of dog as likeable as a golden retriever seem annoying and that succeeds only in its efforts to keep the viewer from falling asleep with an occasional bark from Bailey or one of his furry friends. This is a film to avoid.",1,I'd Rather Walk a Billion Miles Than Watch This Film Again,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,3459,"['Bailey', 'Billions', 'silly', 'family', 'comedy', 'dog', 'who', 'suddenly', 'rich', 'imagination', 'when', 'owner', 'bulk', 'billion-', 'plus', 'dollar', 'inheritance', 'news', 'announced', 'owner', 'video', 'two', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'expected', 'receive', 'much', 'larger', 'sum', 'money', 'did', 'proceed', 'develop', 'plot', 'get', 'rid', 'Bailey', 'get', 'inheritance', 'themselves-', 'typical', 'reaction', 'typical', 'direction', 'movie', 'type', 'plot', 'take.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'simple', 'one', 'never', 'very', 'far', 'few', 'silly', 'laughs', 'few', 'stupid', 'gags', 'add', 'little', 'more', 'entertainment', 'Bailey', 'other', 'dogs', 'movie', 'actually', 'talk', 'mouths', 'move', 'manner', 'similar', 'human', 'mouth', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'voice', 'Bailey', 'things', 'Bailey', 'are', 'usually', 'sarcastic', 'when', 'talking', 'people', 'Bailey', 'tone', 'little', 'bit', 'when', 'eyes', 'are', 'cast', 'cute', 'female', 'pooch', 'turning', 'smooth', 'talking', 'canine', 'taste', 'romance', 'other', 'wit', 'sarcastic', 'more', 'often', 'not', ""n't"", 'very', 'humorous', 'very', 'clever.Performances', 'movie', 'are', 'average', 'best', 'below', 'average', 'worst', 'only', 'performers', 'are', 'worth', 'mention', 'are', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Laurie', 'Holden', 'are', 'believable', 'roles', 'even', 'seem', 'little', 'awkward', 'Part', 'plot', 'movie', 'budding', 'romance', 'shy', 'nerdy', 'Cain', 'more', 'confident', 'self-', 'assured', 'Holden', ""n't"", 'really', 'play', 'much', 'main', 'plot', 'film', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excluded', 'Holden', 'least', 'cute', 'enough', 'make', 'scenes', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'memorable', 'members', 'greedy', 'couple', 'trying', 'get', 'Bailey', 'money-', 'played', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly-', 'perform', 'poorly', 'even', 'are', 'two', 'key', 'people', 'movie', 'add', 'little', 'seem', 'so', 'fake', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'character', 'annoying', 'max', 'constant', 'chattering', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'take', 'cue', 'husband', 'others', 'shut', 'big', 'mouth', 'lame', 'attempts', 'comedy', 'are', 'forced', 'even', 'attempts', 'wit', 'dogs', 'are', 'stupid-', 'type', 'comedy', 'anyone', 'seven', 'years', 'age', 'would', 'find', 'lame', 'found', 'shaking', 'head', 'more', 'anything', 'wondering', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'created', 'mess.The', 'idea', 'movie', ""n't"", 'anything', 'original', 'could', 'have', 'still', 'been', 'successful', 'little', 'more', 'details', 'more', 'believable', 'plot', 'cast', 'Instead', 'director', 'tried', 'keep', 'movie', 'more', 'juvenile', 'side', 'doing', 'so', 'ruined', 'most', 'chance', 'becoming', 'memorable', 'motion', 'picture', 'rating', 'movie', 'NR', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'listed', 'G', 'rating', 'Even', 'G', 'rating', 'directing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'way', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'being', 'offensive', 'David', 'Devine', 'took', 'easy', 'way', 'keeping', 'film', 'silly', 'shallow', 'nothing', 'very', 'memorable.I', 'dogs', 'often', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'feature', 'dogs', 'main', 'roles', 'Bailey', 'Billions', 'flop-', 'film', 'make', 'breed', 'dog', 'as', 'likeable', 'golden', 'retriever', 'seem', 'annoying', 'only', 'efforts', 'keep', 'viewer', 'falling', 'asleep', 'occasional', 'bark', 'Bailey', 'one', 'furry', 'friends', 'film', 'avoid']",Bailey's Billion$

Young children and people who like watching movies with talking dogs may actually get a kick out of it.Bailey is a golden retriever that inherits billions from his deceased owner who loved him dearly because he was a wonderful companion. Tim Curry is the nephew and sole would-be heir of the childless wealthy woman, but he and his spoiled brat wife, Jennifer Tilly, only inherit the management of her foundation that helps animals. (Jennifer Tilly complains a lot and throws tantrums.) Dean Cain is an animal behavior specialist who can understand what Bailey is saying though no one else can make distinctions between one bark over another.Cain and the attractive female animal rights activist who works at the foundation hit it off. She has a young daughter who befriends a boy after they meet outside the window of a pet shop. Throughout the movie, a corny detective stays on the trail of the animal rights activist due to her past activities in a monkey lab. The greedy couple, Curry and Tilly, are not nice to their employees, nor to the dogs.
