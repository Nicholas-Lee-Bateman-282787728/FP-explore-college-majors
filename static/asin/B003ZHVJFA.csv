The year is 2039, to exact revenge on the one who caused his mother's death, Jin must defeat the world's most elite fighters in the ""Iron Fist Tournament"".Despite what professional reviewers have been saying about the movie, I personally thought it was a decent martial arts movie. Like most videogame movie adaptions, people are going to pan over this movie and claim it doesn't do the series justice..to which I say- not every movie can have a million dollar budget so certain liberties have to be taken with it. I don't really think the game's storyline would have fit too well in a film, honestly. In that measure, I think Director Dwight Little did an awesome job. The film was entertaining and kept my attention all the way through to the end.The only gripe that I had with the movie was I felt that the fights didn't last long enough onscreen and the camera could've been a little more focused instead of jumping all around the action so much.Still, I liked the film. It did what I hoped it'd do and that was entertain me. To me, that's all that matters in the end.

1377367,A17LCDEFG5OXSQ,B003ZHVJFA,Curtis Mitchell,"[0, 1]","Well, I've got to start this review by saying that this movie is a total guilty pleasure.  Tekken certainly isn't a good movie and it is by no means the film adaptation of the hit video game series that Tekken fans everywhere would have loved to see.  Fighting games are known for having convoluted and awkward storylines and its nice to see that they didn't really bother with that here.  Beyond having the basics of the Mishima-Kazama clan down and how they're all related to each other, the movie doesn't take a whole lot from the games.  The people who made the film evidently at least watched footage of the series however, since they seem to realize its all about fighting.Aesthetically, the movie has a lot in common with the dystopian sci-fi flicks of the late 80s and early 90s and like movies with names like Escape From New York, the quality of the acting is about the same.  There's some competence from the leads but the supports and backups are all dreadful.  Tekken is by no means oscar-worthy material but if you are able to divorce it from the inconsistencies with the story in the game franchise, it is a pretty decent popcorn flick.  The film quality is excellent and some of the fights are very good.  The film doesn't demonstrate a lot of real world logic and I'm not sure if that's because they couldn't be bothered to write good dialogue or if they realized the dialogue was just filler in between the fight scenes but either way there's a lot of (usually unintentional) humor in between the fight scenes.  I was definitely entertained by the movie however.  I'd give it a solid thumbs up to anyone who is into cheese and over-the-top action with a touch of overacting.  If you're a serious fan of the game franchise however, it's probably a solid avoid since they definitely didn't bother to familiarize themselves with the actual storyline from the games.",3,"Umm, well, its a video game movie",1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,1880,"['Well', ""'ve"", 'got', 'start', 'review', 'saying', 'movie', 'total', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Tekken', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'film', 'adaptation', 'hit', 'video', 'game', 'series', 'Tekken', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'Fighting', 'games', 'are', 'known', 'having', 'convoluted', 'awkward', 'storylines', 'nice', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'here', 'Beyond', 'having', 'basics', 'Mishima-Kazama', 'clan', 'down', 'how', ""'re"", 'related', 'other', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'whole', 'lot', 'games', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'evidently', 'least', 'watched', 'footage', 'series', 'however', 'seem', 'realize', 'fighting.Aesthetically', 'movie', 'lot', 'common', 'dystopian', 'sci-fi', 'flicks', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'movies', 'names', 'Escape', 'From', 'New', 'York', 'quality', 'acting', 'same', 'competence', 'leads', 'supports', 'backups', 'are', 'dreadful', 'Tekken', 'means', 'oscar-worthy', 'material', 'are', 'able', 'divorce', 'inconsistencies', 'story', 'game', 'franchise', 'pretty', 'decent', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'film', 'quality', 'excellent', 'fights', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'film', ""n't"", 'demonstrate', 'lot', 'real', 'world', 'logic', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'write', 'good', 'dialogue', 'realized', 'dialogue', 'was', 'just', 'filler', 'fight', 'scenes', 'way', 'lot', 'usually', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'fight', 'scenes', 'was', 'definitely', 'entertained', 'movie', 'however', ""'d"", 'give', 'solid', 'thumbs', 'anyone', 'who', 'cheese', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'touch', 'overacting', ""'re"", 'serious', 'fan', 'game', 'franchise', 'however', 'probably', 'solid', 'avoid', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'familiarize', 'actual', 'storyline', 'games']",N/A

1377370,A1MBR816GYHY71,B003ZHVJFA,"Doc ""Dr. M. Anthony Collins, Ph.D., CIET""","[0, 1]","I was totally disappointed when I watched this movie. The action didn't live up hype or even came to the level of action noted in the video games. The selection of fighters was highly questionable as well as their fight scenes. There was more action in the general stunts rather than the actual fights. This was a let down. They could have used CGI to display more complex fighters e.g. Jacks (weak- used average people in military-Goth gear), Yoshimitsu (weak-used a stunt man non MA), King (not in the movie)), but they didn't.Did I say this movie was a down. However, if you are a collector of Gary Daniels movies you might want to add this to your collection. Gary plays Bryan Fury. The casting for this movie was about 40% on target, the use of the martial artist was highly questionable. There was a lot of open space i.e. lag time scenes and not enough action. It didn't keep my attention. I stopped and pulled out one of my reference books to go over my notes at times. My wife had to ask me to watch this with her. It was disappointing when you are suppose to have highly skilled MA fighters like Nina Williams and you have her and her sister in a questionable position (unless you are twisted and have no moral you may like this suggestive scene). Martial Law's fight scenes were also questionable. Steve Scott's role was questionable and  you have an unknown Russian fighter not in any of the games in the movie.

Mortal Kombat is the best but Max Payne, Prince of Persia, Resident Evil, Hitman, Final Fantasy S.W. and Silent Hill were so-so and the rest is garbage.

It wasn't THAT bad because some fights were pretty cool and the dark environment did matched with the videogame but it wasn't good enough for me.

The Tekken Movie is another one of those failed adaptions, right there with the Street Fighter movie, and Dragonball Movie. Much better than the Dragonball movie, but probably even with the Street Fighter movie. Complete lack of thought as far as the story is concerned. Not 1 reference to the Devil curse (Which can be excused). Kazuya Mishima has major character flaws. He is too whiny, and not nearly vicious enough to be the real Kazuya Mishima. Plus he has a goatee in this movie (O.O) wtf?! Heihachi Mishima was ok but yet more character flaws. He was a much more honorable man in the movie than he is in the games. In the games he is a bitter old man with a hatred for his son and grandson. Not the case in this movie. Jin Kazama was probably the better part of the movie. The outfits were all spot on, but relevance and character was lacking big time. Jin has a smaller build than he should have had which can also be excused considering it is supposed to be a younger Jin Kazama. You can tell its a low budget film as the entire Anvil part of the movie looks like stage props from a play. The only other issues I care to point out are Christie and Nina. Nina Williams has always been one of the 5 Star fighters in the games. She was always a pain in the ass to beat but Christie disposes of her like she is nothing. Unacceptable. Also Christie is not using Capoera like she, and Eddy Gordo use in the games. Eddy uses it in the movie but not Christie. Beside these great flaws in the movie, it was worth 1 watch but I am going to trade it in a movie stop. If you know nothing about the Tekken story then you will likely enjoy it, the fight scenes are excellent minus the fighting style mishaps. 2 Stars.",2,Worth 1 watch.

This film has about as much to do with Tekken as the Friday the 13th films have to do with the television show. They used the names and some of the character designs, but nothing else (and only very little of even that). The movie bears a closer resemblance to Bloodsport crossed with Blade Runner.In terms of plot, it's rather clich&eacute;. If you've watched more than one Kung Fu flick in your lifetime, chances are you've already seen everything they do here. It's a typical plot about a young fighter who enters a tournament to get revenge for the death of a loved one. It's got an artificial romantic subplot, one-dimensional filler characters, an archetypical villain, stormtroopers, etc... I don't really mind that they didn't stick to Tekken bible, but if they were going to change things the least they could've done was come up with something original. Instead we get a movie we've seen a thousand times before, but with different actors. Yay?The Cinematography is terrible. Apparently Mr. Little is one of those directors who thinks that violently shaking the camera during action scenes as though you have epilepsy adds tension or some sense of danger. All it does is make it very difficult to tell what is going on, and gives you a headache. Everybody says the fight choreography is great but I honestly couldn't tell you, I had no idea what was going on half the time.In the end this is neither a tekken movie nor a good action flick. You're much better of watching an old Bruce Lee flick or just playing the video games than investing in this thing. My advice?

1377380,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003ZHVJFA,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","It seemed that in the 90's tons of video games that were popular in the 80's were being turned into movies. It was a logical extension as there was tons of action taking place in each game and players were putting themselves into the middle of it. That is as long as the movies were based on first person action games and not things like Tetris. Most of those movies were popular enough with MORTAL KOMBAT going so far as to have a sequel, but the fad died off for a time. It's come back with a vengeance in the past few years and now yields TEKKEN based on the fighting game.The year is 2039 and the world is ruled by corporations rather than governments. The old world fell some years back and the corporations filled the voice, taking over and controlling the masses. What was once the United States is now ruled by the largest corporation of them all, Tekken.But things haven't changed with the exception of walls that divide one social class from another. Outside is a life of poverty and trying to survive, inside a world of luxury and technology. Protecting this way of life are the armed soldiers who rain down on the lower class should they try and move upward.Jin Kazama (Jon Foo) is a young man who works the streets doing everything from stealing for the resistance movement to finding whatever it takes to survive. His mother Jun (Tamilyn Tomita) has done her best with him, training him in martial arts to learn the beauty of it more so than the power. But Jin still has much to learn.When the Tekken soldiers raid the resistance and connect Jin to the latest tech theft, they set out to catch him. Their leader Kazuya (Ian Anthony Dale) makes the decision not to capture anyone in Jin's home but to blow it up instead with Jun and a few soldiers still inside. Jin watches as his mother dies and blames the leader of Tekken, Heihachi Mishima (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) for her death.A chance to get back at Heihachi arrives in a competition known as the King of the Iron Fist. Combatants have been involved for years but there is always a people's choice involved, someone who bests the competitor Marshall Law if they can. Jin enters this street tournament and wins, giving him a chance to go into the city and to become involved in the competition locating him one step closer to Heihachi.The man in charge of the street competition is Steve Fox (Luke Goss) and he joins Jin as his manager. Fox knows the ins and outs of the game, knows the weaknesses of the other fighters and helps Jin to learn his own limitations and how to do better. Their first fight results in a win for Jin and earns him the inquisitive eye of Kazuya.Backstage fighting goes on not just among the fighters but in the house of Tekken as well. Heihachi doesn't believe that Kazuya is ready to take over as the ruler of the house, but Kazuya has no patience to wait for his time. Instead he plots a take over and sets out to follow through with the Iron Fist competition in the background.But wait there's more! Jin has a connection to the Tekken clan that no one is aware of with the exception of Kazuya. And it's one that he doesn't plan on letting anyone else learn about so he sends someone to kill Jin before he can compete again. When that fails, he ousts Heihachi as ruler, takes over and changes the rules of the game. It is now a competition where each fighter can win only with the death of the other.All will be revealed before the final reel and a one on one match between Jin and Kazuya takes place. Who wins? Oh come on, I won't spoil it but you have to know already.The film has a well shot look to it but falls back on the stereotypical ""end of the world"" look, a set design that involves combining bits and pieces of scrap metal into homes covered with dirt and grime. It's a set design that's been used since the first Mad Max film and ever since. And inside the city? More gleaming glass and high rises like most films of this kind.The best thing in the film is the fight choreography, set up by Cyril Raffaelli. If you've seen DISTRICT B13 or the sequel then you've seen Raffaelli in action. He does a great job here and will be someone to keep an eye on in the future.The movie itself reminded me of those old game to movie films made in the 90's and if you were a fan of those movies you'll get a kick (no pun intended) out of this one. It's pure escapist action and if that's what you're looking for you'll find it here.",3,ANOTHER GAME COMES ALIVE,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,4427,"['seemed', '90', 'tons', 'video', 'games', 'were', 'popular', '80', 'were', 'being', 'turned', 'movies', 'was', 'logical', 'extension', 'was', 'tons', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'game', 'players', 'were', 'putting', 'middle', 'as', 'long', 'movies', 'were', 'based', 'first', 'person', 'action', 'games', 'not', 'things', 'Tetris', 'Most', 'movies', 'were', 'popular', 'enough', 'MORTAL', 'KOMBAT', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'sequel', 'fad', 'died', 'off', 'time', 'come', 'back', 'vengeance', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'yields', 'TEKKEN', 'based', 'fighting', 'game.The', 'year', '2039', 'world', 'ruled', 'corporations', 'rather', 'governments', 'old', 'world', 'fell', 'years', 'back', 'corporations', 'filled', 'voice', 'taking', 'over', 'controlling', 'masses', 'What', 'was', 'once', 'United', 'States', 'now', 'ruled', 'largest', 'corporation', 'Tekken.But', 'things', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'exception', 'walls', 'divide', 'one', 'social', 'class', 'Outside', 'life', 'poverty', 'trying', 'survive', 'world', 'luxury', 'technology', 'Protecting', 'way', 'life', 'are', 'armed', 'soldiers', 'who', 'rain', 'down', 'lower', 'class', 'should', 'try', 'move', 'upward.Jin', 'Kazama', 'Jon', 'Foo', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'streets', 'doing', 'everything', 'stealing', 'resistance', 'movement', 'finding', 'whatever', 'survive', 'mother', 'Jun', 'Tamilyn', 'Tomita', 'done', 'best', 'training', 'martial', 'arts', 'learn', 'beauty', 'more', 'so', 'power', 'Jin', 'still', 'much', 'learn.When', 'Tekken', 'soldiers', 'raid', 'resistance', 'connect', 'Jin', 'latest', 'tech', 'theft', 'set', 'out', 'catch', 'leader', 'Kazuya', 'Ian', 'Anthony', 'Dale', 'decision', 'not', 'capture', 'anyone', 'Jin', 'home', 'blow', 'up', 'instead', 'Jun', 'few', 'soldiers', 'still', 'inside', 'Jin', 'mother', 'dies', 'leader', 'Tekken', 'Heihachi', 'Mishima', 'Cary-Hiroyuki', 'Tagawa', 'death.A', 'chance', 'get', 'back', 'Heihachi', 'competition', 'known', 'King', 'Iron', 'Fist', 'Combatants', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'years', 'always', 'people', 'choice', 'involved', 'someone', 'who', 'competitor', 'Marshall', 'Law', 'can', 'Jin', 'enters', 'street', 'tournament', 'wins', 'giving', 'chance', 'go', 'city', 'become', 'involved', 'competition', 'locating', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'Heihachi.The', 'man', 'charge', 'street', 'competition', 'Steve', 'Fox', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'Jin', 'manager', 'Fox', 'ins', 'outs', 'game', 'weaknesses', 'other', 'fighters', 'Jin', 'learn', 'own', 'limitations', 'how', 'do', 'better', 'first', 'fight', 'results', 'win', 'Jin', 'inquisitive', 'eye', 'Kazuya.Backstage', 'fighting', 'not', 'just', 'fighters', 'house', 'Tekken', 'as', 'well', 'Heihachi', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Kazuya', 'ready', 'take', 'over', 'ruler', 'house', 'Kazuya', 'patience', 'wait', 'time', 'Instead', 'take', 'sets', 'out', 'follow', 'Iron', 'Fist', 'competition', 'background.But', 'wait', 'more', 'Jin', 'connection', 'Tekken', 'clan', 'one', 'aware', 'exception', 'Kazuya', 'one', ""n't"", 'plan', 'letting', 'anyone', 'else', 'so', 'someone', 'kill', 'Jin', 'can', 'compete', 'again', 'When', 'Heihachi', 'ruler', 'rules', 'game', 'now', 'competition', 'where', 'fighter', 'can', 'win', 'only', 'death', 'other.All', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'final', 'reel', 'one', 'one', 'match', 'Jin', 'Kazuya', 'place', 'Who', 'Oh', 'come', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'have', 'know', 'already.The', 'film', 'well', 'shot', 'look', 'back', 'stereotypical', 'end', 'world', 'look', 'set', 'design', 'combining', 'bits', 'pieces', 'scrap', 'metal', 'homes', 'covered', 'dirt', 'grime', 'set', 'design', 'been', 'used', 'first', 'Mad', 'Max', 'film', 'ever', 'city', 'More', 'gleaming', 'glass', 'high', 'rises', 'most', 'films', 'kind.The', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'fight', 'choreography', 'set', 'up', 'Cyril', 'Raffaelli', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DISTRICT', 'B13', 'sequel', 'then', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Raffaelli', 'action', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'someone', 'keep', 'eye', 'future.The', 'movie', 'reminded', 'old', 'game', 'movie', 'films', 'made', '90', 'were', 'fan', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'get', 'kick', 'pun', 'intended', 'one', 'pure', 'escapist', 'action', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', ""'ll"", 'find', 'here']",N/A
1377381,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B003ZHVJFA,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[23, 26]","If nothing else, ""Tekken"" gets in my good graces just for being what it is: a flashy and ultimately decent tournament-based martial arts movie bearing an impressive cast list. The film's eventual falling point, however, is that it's based on a video game series that's so much better than decent that I can't help but lament that it isn't as awesome as what I've been able to create on arcade screens for the past sixteen years. If judged solely on these latter disadvantages, my rating for this film would be lower, but in light of my genuine appreciation for the remaining content, I'm going to consider it from a rounder perspective and name it as one of the better adaptations out there.Like in most video game flicks, the story suffers. It's played straight and high-tech, excluding all supernatural elements from the games and seriously watering down the triangle of contempt that serves as the canon plotline between the three main characters, Jin Kazama (Jon Foo,The Protector), Kazuya Mishima (Ian Anthony Dale,Mortal Kombat: Legacy), and Heihachi Mishima (Cary Tagawa,Mortal Kombat). The film takes place in a dystopian future where the Mishima-run Tekken corporation reigns supreme over a scarred earth and sponsors a regular fighting tournament to keep the masses entertained. After the death of his mother at the hands of the organization, Jin enters the tournament to avenge her while Kazuya plots the overthrow of his father.The backgrounds of most of the characters have been addled a bit as well, which is disappointing but I'll argue that their better-than-average casting makes up for some of this: Kelly Overton (Breaking Dawn) as Chirstie Monteiro, Luke Goss (Blade II) as Steve Fox, Gary Daniels (The Expendables) as Bryan Fury, Darrin Henson (Soul Food) as Raven, Lateef Crowder (Undisputed III: Redemption) as Eddy Gordo, Cung Le (Pandorum) as Marshall Law, and several others are swell fits, making for one of the best ensembles ever seen in a fighting-themed adaptation like this (or at least a much better one than inThe King of Fighters). Utilization of these performers and characters, however, is another issue: Heihachi and Steve Fox are prominent characters but don't fight at all, Kazuya is written as a slimy rich boy rather than the fighting beast we know him as, and - with very few exceptions - no character besides Jin has more than a single fight.When they do fight, however, it's mostly good stuff. Director Dwight Little hasn't done much action fare since he directed Steven Seagal and Brandon Lee during their prime, but he seems to have gotten better with age: he and choreographer Cyril Raffaelli wrangle some very competent brawls which occasionally peak as deliciously eye-opening, like during the Eddie Gordo and Bryan Fury fights. In-game fighting styles are mimicked pretty well (sans Marshall Law, whose portrayer sticks with his MMA instead of jeet kune do) and even the actors who aren't real-life martial artists come across looking tough, particularly Miss Overton. On the downside, almost all of the fights could've been longer, if only to do justice to the millions of times the same match-ups have taken place between gamers, and slow-motion was unquestionably overutilized. The final match between Jin and Kazuya was ruined by the movie's portrayal of the latter, but the remaining seven should all be considered generally satisfying if you're not out to hate them.In the end, this one doesn't transcend the game-to-movie curse that we're all waiting to see shed and hardcore fans will rightfully bash the snot out of the altered storyline and missing characters, but as far as this button-masher goes, my needs have been sated...maybe not by the ideal ""Tekken"" movie, but by a good fight flick that ought to have gotten better than a direct-to-video release.",3,"""Defeat is a choice.

1377382,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B003ZHVJFA,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 0]","Growing up playing the Tekken games, the idea of a live-action Tekken film brought back memories of seeing other fighting games brought to the big screen, namely the Mortal Kombat films, two abysmal Street Fighter flicks, and the gloriously bad Dead or Alive adaptation from a few years back.  Combine that with the fact that the Tekken games feature so many characters with such convoluted backstories and storylines that it would be incredibly difficult to fit even a handful of them into a film and have it make a lick of sense...but here we are with Tekken the movie.  John Foo plays Jin Kazama, a young and talented martial artist living in a post-apocalyptic future run by the Mishima organization and led by father Heihachi (Mortal Kombat's Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil son Kazuya (Ian Anthony Dale).  After the death of Jin's mother, Jin sets his sights on the Mishima's by entering the King of Iron Fist Tournament, and soon runs into an assortment of familiar names like Christie (the smoking Kelly Overton), Steve Fox (Luke Goss), Bryan Fury (Gary Daniels), and Raven (Darrin Dewitt Henson), while also having brief interactions with characters like sisters Nina and Anna Williams, Eddy Gordo, Dragunov, and Marshall Law.  It's flashy, and even a little fun to a degree, but for the most part Tekken is lacking in all the departments that it appears to promise to the viewer in terms of martial arts action and mayhem.  Not to mention the fact that the cast is so over-the-top and some of the casting choices are beyond questionable.  Still though, it's better than any of the live action Street Fighter flicks ever were, so with that being said you could certainly do a lot worse.",2,"Not as overly horrible as I expected, but still pretty bad",1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,1698,"['Growing', 'up', 'playing', 'Tekken', 'games', 'idea', 'live-action', 'Tekken', 'film', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'seeing', 'other', 'fighting', 'games', 'brought', 'big', 'screen', 'namely', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'films', 'two', 'abysmal', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'flicks', 'gloriously', 'bad', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'adaptation', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Combine', 'fact', 'Tekken', 'games', 'feature', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'such', 'convoluted', 'backstories', 'storylines', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'fit', 'even', 'handful', 'film', 'have', 'make', 'lick', 'sense', 'here', 'are', 'Tekken', 'movie', 'John', 'Foo', 'Jin', 'Kazama', 'young', 'talented', 'martial', 'artist', 'living', 'post-apocalyptic', 'future', 'run', 'Mishima', 'organization', 'led', 'father', 'Heihachi', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'Cary-Hiroyuki', 'Tagawa', 'evil', 'son', 'Kazuya', 'Ian', 'Anthony', 'Dale', 'death', 'Jin', 'mother', 'Jin', 'sights', 'Mishima', 'entering', 'King', 'Iron', 'Fist', 'Tournament', 'soon', 'runs', 'assortment', 'familiar', 'names', 'Christie', 'smoking', 'Kelly', 'Overton', 'Steve', 'Fox', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'Bryan', 'Fury', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'Raven', 'Darrin', 'Dewitt', 'Henson', 'also', 'having', 'brief', 'interactions', 'characters', 'sisters', 'Nina', 'Anna', 'Williams', 'Eddy', 'Gordo', 'Dragunov', 'Marshall', 'Law', 'flashy', 'even', 'little', 'fun', 'degree', 'most', 'part', 'Tekken', 'lacking', 'departments', 'promise', 'viewer', 'terms', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'mayhem', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'cast', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'casting', 'choices', 'are', 'questionable', 'Still', 'better', 'live', 'action', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'flicks', 'ever', 'were', 'so', 'being', 'said', 'could', 'certainly', 'do', 'lot', 'worse']",N/A

I liked how this movie actually tried to make the movie like the video game. In the beginning and in the middle the story was really good. After that at some point the story just goes crazy and doesn't make sense, well at least to me it didn't.At the end of the film, which I hated that the most, the writers made way too much room for a second movie. I think that's where they made the biggest mistake and I would had given it 5 stars. This is what I would had expected to see for an ending. Jin wins the tournament, and then Jin and Christine start off helping change the world they live in for the better. Jin has just won Tekken and now he is KING of the fighters and also the head of the company. He has the power to change the world as he sees it now. Also, he has the people vote. Jin and Christine should live happy ever after with each other too. But no, that doesn't happen.What happens at the end of the movie? When Jin wins, I see him say ""I'm going home"". He then hurries and leaves the place. The narrator then says ""this is just the beginning."" What kind of ending was that? He just won king of the fighters! This is what he wanted to do from the start and he fought so hard to do. He doesn't show any joy or emotion about it. He looks stone cold dead and leaves the place like he is pissed. WHAT???Also, he doesn't stay with Christine at the end? I thought they really liked each other. Well, that's what I saw in the movie because it sure looked like there was a love story brewing. What worse about the movie is, why does he have to go in the first place? Where is he going go? His home is Tekken! His old house that he was living in actually blew up. Is he going to rebuild it or something? Why? He has a whole corporation and he can live anywhere he wants. So, he should actually head upstairs.The scene where he starts walking with people in the city towards the camera is good.

I don't see the point of turning a video game into a film in this way.",2,So-so Action Needs Better Choreography,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,1724,"['Tekken', 'meaning', 'Iron', 'Fist', 'live-action', 'film', 'popular', 'fighting', 'game', 'series', 'will', 'say', 'Not', 'again', 'Back', '90s', 'saw', 'terrible', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'starring', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'more', 'recently', 'equally', 'terrible', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'Legend', 'Chun-Li', 'Good', 'news', 'least', 'leading', 'star', 'new', 'film', 'Jon', 'Foo', 'can', 'do', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'not', 'as', 'charismatic', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Bad', 'news', 'well', 'none', 'filmmakers', 'know', 'how', 'shoot', 'action', 'scenes', 'Tekken', 'set', 'near', 'futuristic', 'dystopian', 'world', 'North', 'America', 'control', 'powerful', 'Mishima', 'Zaibatsu', 'also', 'martial', 'arts', 'tournament', 'King', 'Iron', 'Fist', 'Tournament', 'Having', 'lost', 'mother', 'Jun', 'Tamlyn', 'Tomita', 'young', 'fighter', 'Jin', 'Jon', 'Foo', 'kill-or-be-killed', 'competition', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'man', 'who', 'responsible', 'death', 'Heihachi', 'Mishima', 'Cary-Hiroyuki', 'Tagawa', '.The', 'story', 'silly', 'know', 'want', 'exiting', 'action', 'film', 'few', 'decent', 'set-pieces', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'Jin', 'manager', 'pretty', 'good', 'Kelly', 'Overton', 'Christie', 'Monteiro', 'fighter', 'love', 'interest', 'yes', 'not', 'bad', 'also', 'admire', 'Cary-Hiroyuki', 'Tagawa', 'not', 'refusing', 'do', 'character', 'unique', 'hairstyle', '[', 'Minor', 'Spoiler', 'Paragraph', ']', 'However', 'film', 'worse', 'film', 'underwhelming', 'wrap-up', 'Action', 'become', 'repetitive', 'Characters', 'tend', 'repeat', 'same', 'moves', 'worst', 'martial', 'arts', 'sequences', 'should', 'be', 'center', 'movie', 'are', 'interrupted', 'gunshots', 'twice', 'Williams', 'sisters', 'one', 'just', 'stands', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'point', 'turning', 'video', 'game', 'film', 'way']",N/A

I remember seeing the trailer for this, and I thought it looked awesome. So I had pre ordered it on blu ray/dvd/digital copy combo pack. Prior to this film, there was the hit tekken anime film from 1997.Story: This film takes place in the future. Kazuya, Heihachi, Jun, and Steve Fox are older. The city is living under a marshall law, run by a military, and Jin is a skilled street fighter trained by his mother, Jun Kazama. After ""Heihachi"" fires a missle at jin's house, killing his mother, jin decides to join the Iron fist tournament. Jin wins an open fight call against marshall law. He is then known as the people's choice and is sent to the Iron fist tournament. Steve fox is guiding Jin through the iron fist tournament. The second and best fight of the film is Raven vs Eddie Gordo. Jin fights his way to get revenge on heihachi mishima, unaware that he is his grandfather, and kazuya is his father. Jin meets a sweet gal, Christie montero. The story is great, the concept is great, stays true to the game in every way.Casting: Jin was casted perfectly, he has the hair, the tattoo, the body, the hoodie, and even the fighting style. Heihachi looks almost identical. Kazuya still has the scar on his face, he still has his sadistic side. Marshall law delivers some great fighting moves as he does in the game, good casting over there. Raven, again looks identical to the game, no joke. Eddie gordo, one of my favorite characters. Miguel roja, nice casting, looks like the character. Jun kazama looks great. Steve fox, he has aged because he is in the future, but he looks good. Sergei dragonov, another one of my favorite characters, well casted. Yoshimitsu, a master swordsman, looks awesome. Nina and anna williams, they look as great as always. Bryan fury was more than I had expected! Great casting by all actors.Fight scenes: These are the most well choreographed fight scenes I have ever scene. Within the fight between Eddie gordo and Raven, you notice how well choreographed gordo's moves are, they are literally taken from the game. The way raven reverses gordo's move is beyond me. Jin's actor is clearly a skilled fighter. The actor playing marshall law is a real fighting champion. The final fight of the film is totally epic, I was stunned by the total non stop action.Blu ray quality: The blu ray quality is great, so is the dvd quality. The digital copy downloads perfectly onto your PC. The set comes with the making of the film.Final Word: This is definitely one of my favorite video game adaptations of all time. This is a tekken must have. I hear they are currently working on a prequel entitled ""Tekken Rise of the tournament."" Cannot wait for that. There is not a single thing about this film that could be better. I will be reviewing Tekken blood vengeance soon, and tekken 1997. There are many great video game films out there but this is one of the best.",5,A masterpiece!,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,2961,"['love', 'tekken', 'franchise', 'always', 'been', 'pleasure', 'playing', 'remember', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'thought', 'looked', 'awesome', 'had', 'pre', 'ordered', 'blu', 'ray/dvd/digital', 'copy', 'combo', 'pack', 'Prior', 'film', 'was', 'hit', 'tekken', 'anime', 'film', '1997.Story', 'film', 'place', 'future', 'Kazuya', 'Heihachi', 'Jun', 'Steve', 'Fox', 'are', 'older', 'city', 'living', 'marshall', 'law', 'run', 'military', 'Jin', 'skilled', 'street', 'fighter', 'trained', 'mother', 'Jun', 'Kazama', 'Heihachi', 'missle', 'jin', 'house', 'killing', 'mother', 'jin', 'decides', 'join', 'Iron', 'fist', 'tournament', 'Jin', 'open', 'fight', 'call', 'marshall', 'law', 'then', 'known', 'people', 'choice', 'sent', 'Iron', 'fist', 'tournament', 'Steve', 'fox', 'guiding', 'Jin', 'iron', 'fist', 'tournament', 'second', 'best', 'fight', 'film', 'Raven', 'vs', 'Eddie', 'Gordo', 'Jin', 'fights', 'way', 'get', 'revenge', 'heihachi', 'mishima', 'unaware', 'grandfather', 'kazuya', 'father', 'Jin', 'sweet', 'gal', 'Christie', 'montero', 'story', 'great', 'concept', 'great', 'true', 'game', 'way.Casting', 'Jin', 'was', 'casted', 'perfectly', 'hair', 'tattoo', 'body', 'hoodie', 'even', 'fighting', 'style', 'Heihachi', 'almost', 'identical', 'Kazuya', 'still', 'scar', 'face', 'still', 'sadistic', 'side', 'Marshall', 'law', 'great', 'fighting', 'moves', 'game', 'good', 'casting', 'there', 'Raven', 'again', 'identical', 'game', 'joke', 'Eddie', 'gordo', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Miguel', 'roja', 'nice', 'casting', 'character', 'Jun', 'kazama', 'great', 'Steve', 'fox', 'aged', 'future', 'good', 'Sergei', 'dragonov', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'well', 'casted', 'Yoshimitsu', 'master', 'swordsman', 'awesome', 'Nina', 'anna', 'williams', 'look', 'as', 'great', 'always', 'Bryan', 'fury', 'was', 'more', 'had', 'expected', 'Great', 'casting', 'actors.Fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'well', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'scene', 'fight', 'Eddie', 'gordo', 'Raven', 'notice', 'how', 'well', 'choreographed', 'gordo', 'moves', 'are', 'are', 'literally', 'taken', 'game', 'way', 'raven', 'gordo', 'move', 'Jin', 'actor', 'clearly', 'skilled', 'fighter', 'actor', 'playing', 'marshall', 'law', 'real', 'fighting', 'champion', 'final', 'fight', 'film', 'totally', 'epic', 'was', 'stunned', 'total', 'non', 'stop', 'action.Blu', 'ray', 'quality', 'blu', 'ray', 'quality', 'great', 'so', 'dvd', 'quality', 'digital', 'copy', 'downloads', 'perfectly', 'PC', 'set', 'making', 'film.Final', 'Word', 'definitely', 'one', 'favorite', 'video', 'game', 'adaptations', 'time', 'tekken', 'must', 'have', 'hear', 'are', 'currently', 'working', 'prequel', 'entitled', 'Tekken', 'Rise', 'tournament', 'Can', 'not', 'wait', 'not', 'single', 'thing', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'will', 'be', 'reviewing', 'Tekken', 'blood', 'vengeance', 'soon', 'tekken', '1997', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'video', 'game', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'one', 'best']",N/A
