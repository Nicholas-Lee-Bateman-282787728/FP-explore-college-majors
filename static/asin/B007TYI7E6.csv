1538011,A39FJZ3RH2KB8X,B007TYI7E6,Barb Shuman,"[0, 0]",I just finished watching the movie Ride a Crooked Trail and I have to admit the movie is very enjoyable to watch. The dvd quality is excellent and I would recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys a good action packed western. The confilcts which occur in the movie can really speak for themselves when people are at a crossroads with decisions they need to make in life. A truly entertaining film.,5,plays perfect.

Audie was one of those who gave it his best it seemed to me like. You also have to like westerns to enjoy this movie, as for me it is hard to enjoy a western made today. Back in the 50's & 60's I tried to watch all the westerns available on black & white TV.
