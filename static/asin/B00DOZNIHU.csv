While my kids are too young to understand crushes and how embarrassing parents can be to teenagers, they still enjoyed the silly slapstick humor.  The first episode focuses on Sunil's psychic abilities to help Blythe reunite with her crush to give him his keys back. The rest of the episodes were harmless and taught lessons like being yourself and not envying another's person's life/blessings over your own.",4,All of my kids enjoyed it,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,485,"['kids', 'including', 'son', 'enjoyed', 'five', 'episode', 'DVD', 'collection', 'kids', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'understand', 'crushes', 'how', 'embarrassing', 'parents', 'can', 'be', 'teenagers', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'silly', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'first', 'episode', 'Sunil', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'help', 'Blythe', 'reunite', 'crush', 'give', 'keys', 'back', 'rest', 'episodes', 'were', 'harmless', 'taught', 'lessons', 'being', 'not', 'envying', 'person', 'life/blessings', 'own']",Littlest Pet Shop: Petacular Escapades

Whether it is because that love animals, are pet owners themselves, or they just love the idea of being able to talk to animals, I don't know, but they are hooked. This series is well made and cover many issues that at least my oldest is starting to deal with. Some of the issues discussed may be a bit too advanced for younger viewers, but the cartoon itself and the characters within will draw the viewer in even further.

1660155,A5P8WMUX28LLZ,B00DOZNIHU,Heidi G.,"[1, 2]","Littlest Petshop Petacular Escapades is a super cute dvd with lots of cute and short episodes on it.  Each episode is about 20 minutes long which is perfect for most kids and parents.  Each of the episodes was just as cute as the next but one thing is for sure, they are full of exciting adventures for both the pets and Blythe.1. Blythe's Crush - Blythe and Zoe return a set of keys to a boy while the other pets meet a legendary parrot.2. Dumb Dumbwaiter - Some of the pets get trapped in a dumbwaiter while the others try to rescue them.3. Lights, Camera, Mongoose - The pets visit with a famous movie star mongoose.4. What Did You Say? - Blythe gets sick and can't understand the pets anymore.5. Terriers & Tiaras - Bad behavior at a pet pageant show.One of the best lessons in my opinion is that no matter what to always be yourself and not envy another person.  Each of us has our own blessings, but sometimes we get wrapped up in what it would be like to be like someone else.  But most importantly we are all individuals and blessed with our own characteristics that someone else looking in might want.Blythe's crush would be a little harder for younger kids to understand because it was more of a ""teenager"" situation.  Blythe and Zoe want to return the set of keys to the boy she likes.  It was a crush situation that most kids wouldn't understand but since our daughter is 16 we all got a cute chuckle or two out of it because it really is ""true to life"" situations.",5,Cute Cartoon for the Kids,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,1477,"['Littlest', 'Petshop', 'Petacular', 'Escapades', 'super', 'cute', 'dvd', 'lots', 'cute', 'short', 'episodes', 'episode', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'perfect', 'most', 'kids', 'parents', 'episodes', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'cute', 'next', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'are', 'full', 'exciting', 'adventures', 'pets', 'Blythe.1', 'Blythe', 'Crush', 'Blythe', 'Zoe', 'return', 'set', 'keys', 'boy', 'other', 'pets', 'meet', 'legendary', 'parrot.2', 'Dumb', 'Dumbwaiter', 'pets', 'get', 'trapped', 'dumbwaiter', 'others', 'try', 'rescue', 'them.3', 'Lights', 'Camera', 'Mongoose', 'pets', 'visit', 'famous', 'movie', 'star', 'mongoose.4', 'What', 'Did', 'Say', 'Blythe', 'sick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'pets', 'anymore.5', 'Terriers', 'Tiaras', 'Bad', 'behavior', 'pet', 'pageant', 'show.One', 'best', 'lessons', 'opinion', 'matter', 'what', 'always', 'be', 'not', 'envy', 'person', 'own', 'blessings', 'sometimes', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'most', 'importantly', 'are', 'individuals', 'blessed', 'own', 'characteristics', 'someone', 'else', 'looking', 'might', 'want.Blythe', 'crush', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'harder', 'younger', 'kids', 'understand', 'was', 'more', 'teenager', 'situation', 'Blythe', 'Zoe', 'want', 'return', 'set', 'keys', 'boy', 'was', 'crush', 'situation', 'most', 'kids', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'daughter', '16', 'got', 'cute', 'chuckle', 'two', 'really', 'true', 'life', 'situations']",Littlest Pet Shop: Petacular Escapades
1660156,A30X9M0J5WOVAS,B00DOZNIHU,The IEMommy,"[2, 2]","As an animal lover, my four year old daughter Paige has always loved the Littlest Pet Shop animals and can spend hours playing with them in their little houses. I knew this love for them would translate to the screen in the newest movie Littlest Pet Shop: Petacular Escapades.The first time my kids watched this DVD was in the car so I could only hear what's going on. It's funny that I usually couldn't differentiate between the animal and human characters just from their voices and conversation. I do think it gave me a unique perspective and I picked up on things I wouldn't have if I was just watching like normal.I think that this particular DVD was a little bit old for my four and five year olds and would have been more appropriate for upper elementary school aged kids. There was nothing inappropriate. The subject matters were just often over their heads.For example, they talked about very current and modern things like flash mobs, boyfriends and makeup. I didn't mind explaining the flash mob to them and my daughter loves makeup but the definition of a boyfriend and the whole episode surrounding it was not a conversation I was ready to have!I was amused by some episodes that lightly made fun of their real counterparts like Terriers & Tiaras. But again, not something my kids picked up on.I think the characters are unique and have fun personalities but it's probably something I should save for when my kids get older! Littlest Pet Shop: Petacular Escapades would be great for girls in upper elementary grades.",4,Modern Themes,1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,1529,"['animal', 'lover', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Paige', 'always', 'loved', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'animals', 'can', 'spend', 'hours', 'playing', 'little', 'houses', 'knew', 'love', 'would', 'translate', 'screen', 'newest', 'movie', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Petacular', 'Escapades.The', 'first', 'time', 'kids', 'watched', 'DVD', 'was', 'car', 'so', 'could', 'only', 'hear', 'what', 'going', 'funny', 'usually', 'could', ""n't"", 'differentiate', 'animal', 'human', 'characters', 'just', 'voices', 'conversation', 'do', 'think', 'gave', 'unique', 'perspective', 'picked', 'up', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'was', 'just', 'watching', 'normal.I', 'think', 'particular', 'DVD', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'old', 'four', 'five', 'year', 'olds', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate', 'upper', 'elementary', 'school', 'aged', 'kids', 'was', 'nothing', 'inappropriate', 'subject', 'matters', 'were', 'just', 'often', 'over', 'heads.For', 'example', 'talked', 'very', 'current', 'modern', 'things', 'flash', 'mobs', 'boyfriends', 'makeup', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'explaining', 'flash', 'mob', 'daughter', 'makeup', 'definition', 'boyfriend', 'whole', 'episode', 'surrounding', 'was', 'not', 'conversation', 'was', 'ready', 'have', 'was', 'amused', 'episodes', 'lightly', 'made', 'fun', 'real', 'counterparts', 'Terriers', 'Tiaras', 'again', 'not', 'something', 'kids', 'picked', 'up', 'on.I', 'think', 'characters', 'are', 'unique', 'have', 'fun', 'personalities', 'probably', 'something', 'should', 'save', 'when', 'kids', 'get', 'older', 'Littlest', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Petacular', 'Escapades', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'girls', 'upper', 'elementary', 'grades']",Littlest Pet Shop: Petacular Escapades
