1548114,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B0087MN9SS,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[7, 7]","Even though both of these movies have premiered on Nickelodeon, it is nice to have to them on DVD to watch anytime.  The first movie is ""Big Time Movie"" from Big Time Rush.  It features the band starting off their first world tour in London and of course they have some adventure to tackle.  The show is pretty wholesome and nothing really inappropriate.  The second movie is ""Rags"" which is boy-Cinderella story.  It stars a guy who has a great voice and his new best friend.  I actually liked Rags better as I'm a sucker for original tween movies - it is just so cute!  For the price of less than $10 it is a great price for two full-movies.  For a tween, especially one who likes Big Time Rush, this would be a perfect gift.",5,Great Value for 2 Full-Movies,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,727,"['Even', 'movies', 'have', 'premiered', 'Nickelodeon', 'nice', 'have', 'DVD', 'watch', 'anytime', 'first', 'movie', 'Big', 'Time', 'Movie', 'Big', 'Time', 'Rush', 'band', 'starting', 'off', 'first', 'world', 'tour', 'London', 'course', 'have', 'adventure', 'tackle', 'show', 'pretty', 'wholesome', 'nothing', 'really', 'inappropriate', 'second', 'movie', 'Rags', 'boy-Cinderella', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'great', 'voice', 'new', 'best', 'friend', 'actually', 'liked', 'Rags', 'better', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'original', 'tween', 'movies', 'just', 'so', 'cute', 'price', 'less', '10', 'great', 'price', 'two', 'full-movies', 'tween', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'Big', 'Time', 'Rush', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'gift']",N/A
