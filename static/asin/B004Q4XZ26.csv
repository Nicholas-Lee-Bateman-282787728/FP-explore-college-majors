The movie was a good attempt to bring back a TV icon... Ironside. Some of the original cast came back to help too. The only thing that made me think twice about this movie was that the original Ironside series was based in San Fransisco CA and the comeback Ironside movie was set in Denver CO.

1423924,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B004Q4XZ26,trebe,"[5, 5]","Raymond Burr became a TV icon playing Perry Mason for nearly a decade (1957-1966), and quickly returned to television in Ironside (1967-75), another groundbreaking series.  Burr played Robert T. Ironside, the Chief of Detectives of the San Francisco police, who lost the use of his legs, after being shot in an assassination attempt.  Ironside's staff included female police officer Eve Whitfield (Barbara Anderson), and in need of a personal aide, the wheelchair bound Ironside recruited Mark Sanger (Don Mitchell), a young African-American man with a criminal record.  While these developments many seem insignificant now, back in 1967 they were progressive for prime time television.Serving as a last hurrah for the original cast of the show, The Return of Ironside (1993) is kind of a bittersweet experience.  While it is a nice bit of nostalgia to see the distinguished cast together once more, sadly Raymond Burr was suffering from cancer, and did not have long to live.  The consummate professional, Burr gives a strong performance in one of his final roles.  Also appearing in the Perry Mason TV movies, Burr remained quite active until his death in 1993.  Barbara Anderson, Don Mitchell, and Elizabeth Baur, who all had not acted in some time, returned for this project, reuniting with Burr and Don Galloway.  Dana Wynter, appears as Ironside's wife Katherine.Ed Brown (Galloway), an assistant chief in the Denver police department, asks the newly retired Ironside to serve as an advisor, after the Chief of Police is murdered.  Joining Ironside in Denver as his aide is Suzanne Dwyer (Perrey Reeves), the daughter of Eve Whitfield (Anderson).  Dwyer discovers that her boyfriend is involved with another woman, and when the woman's house blows up and catches on fire, Suzanne is suspected of killing her boyfriend, and his lover.Eve arrives to support her daughter, and the crisis also brings Judge Mark Sanger and Fran Belding (Baur) to Denver, to lend their support.  Determined to prove Suzanne's innocence, Ironside resigns from the police department, and puts his former colleagues to work.  With Suzanne on trial for double murder, Ed Brown walks a delicate line, between duty and helping his old friends.Centered on Suzanne, the story doesn't have the draw it might have, if one of the original characters was in jeopardy.  There isn't much of a connection to Suzanne, who isn't exactly the most sympathetic character.  Ed Brown and Ironside still have great chemistry together, but Brown being involved in Ironside's private investigation, is pretty ridiculous.  The attempts to integrate the original cast in the story are semi-successful, although characters often have little to do.  With everyone much older, the pace is a little slow, and the finale on a train is rather pedestrian, leaving quite a few a little short of breath.The Return of Ironside is a nice reunion for the original cast, but much time is devoted to other matters, rather than on reestablishing old relationships.  While there is a bit of the old magic still present, with a clich&eacute; ridden story featuring unscrupulous business activities, and crooked cops, this effort doesn't rise very far above average.  A small screen legend, Raymond Burr's later years were mostly devoted playing Perry Mason, and it's rather sweet that he also was able to play Robert Ironside one last time.This movie has been released in region free (Region 0), and Region 1 DVD versions.  The region free version which sells for about $27, is also available at Amazon.UK where at the present exchange rate, the cost there is about $3.50 plus shipping.",3,Robert T.
