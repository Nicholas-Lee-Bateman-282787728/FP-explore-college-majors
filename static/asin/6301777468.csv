265748,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,6301777468,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 6]","The 1976 western spoof entitled ""The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox"", which was produced, directed and co-written by Melvin Frank (1913-1988), was not one of Goldie Hawn's better films.  Goldie plays a saloon dancer in the Old West named Amanda Quaid and meets up with a cheating gambler named Charlie 'Dirtwater Fox' Malloy (George Segal).  After Charlie is forced to help a band of desperados rob a nearby bank, then manage to steal the booty for himself, he is seduced by Amanda, who drugs him to sleep and takes his bag of money, but doesn't realize how much money the bag actually contains hidden within.  She uses the small amount of money that she found in the bag to purchase an expensive, formal black dress to impress a wealthy Mormon (Thayer David, 1927-1978) that she wants to marry.  Having done so, she and the wealthy Mormon's assistant (Conrad Janis) ride off in a stagecoach towards Salt Lake City with Charlie riding after them.  Of course, the band of desperados is after Charlie (and Amanda) because they want the stolen money back.  Rather than spoil the rest of this film's plot, suffice it to say that there's some gun fighting, poker playing, a Jewish wedding (in the Old West no less), a river ride with rapids and lots of chasing on horseback across the wilderness.  The theme song for this film, composed by Charles Fox (who composed much better songs for TV shows such as ""Wonder Woman"" and ""The Love Boat"" in the same year), sounded too much like a psychedelic reworking of ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"" (which was composed by Burt Bacharach & Hal David for the 1969 Oscar-award winning film ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"") with hints of the late 1960's song ""Incense and Peppermints"" by the group Strawberry Alarm Clock.Filmed in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the outdoor cinematography was beautiful. However, the film's chaotic story, as well as its unrealistic and not particularly funny characters, detracted from the film's attempt to be an entertaining western spoof.  Surprisingly, Goldie Hawn received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actress-Musical/Comedy for her work in ""The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox"", but the award went instead to Barbara Streisand for ""A Star is Born"".  While Goldie did have a few funny scenes and funny song moments, her acting was nowhere near as good as her roles in films such as ""Cactus Flower"" (1969), ""Butterflies are Free"" (1972), ""Foul Play"" (1978), ""Private Benjamin"" (1980) or later works.  Consequently, my rating for ""The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox"" is a generous 3 out of 5 stars.",3,"Mildly Funny, but Not one of Goldie Hawn's More Memorable Films",1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,2592,"['1976', 'western', 'spoof', 'entitled', 'Duchess', 'Dirtwater', 'Fox', 'was', 'produced', 'directed', 'co-written', 'Melvin', 'Frank', '1913-1988', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'better', 'films', 'Goldie', 'saloon', 'dancer', 'Old', 'West', 'named', 'Amanda', 'Quaid', 'up', 'cheating', 'gambler', 'named', 'Charlie', 'Fox', 'Malloy', 'George', 'Segal', 'Charlie', 'forced', 'help', 'band', 'desperados', 'rob', 'nearby', 'bank', 'then', 'manage', 'steal', 'booty', 'seduced', 'Amanda', 'who', 'drugs', 'sleep', 'bag', 'money', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'bag', 'actually', 'hidden', 'small', 'amount', 'money', 'found', 'bag', 'purchase', 'expensive', 'formal', 'black', 'dress', 'impress', 'wealthy', 'Mormon', 'Thayer', 'David', '1927-1978', 'marry', 'Having', 'done', 'so', 'wealthy', 'Mormon', 'assistant', 'Conrad', 'Janis', 'ride', 'off', 'stagecoach', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'Charlie', 'riding', 'course', 'band', 'desperados', 'Charlie', 'Amanda', 'want', 'stolen', 'money', 'back', 'Rather', 'spoil', 'rest', 'film', 'plot', 'suffice', 'say', 'gun', 'fighting', 'poker', 'playing', 'Jewish', 'wedding', 'Old', 'West', 'no', 'less', 'river', 'ride', 'rapids', 'lots', 'chasing', 'horseback', 'wilderness', 'theme', 'song', 'film', 'composed', 'Charles', 'Fox', 'who', 'composed', 'much', 'better', 'songs', 'TV', 'shows', 'such', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Love', 'Boat', 'same', 'year', 'sounded', 'too', 'much', 'psychedelic', 'reworking', 'Raindrops', 'Keep', 'Falling', 'My', 'Head', 'was', 'composed', 'Burt', 'Bacharach', 'Hal', 'David', '1969', 'Oscar-award', 'winning', 'film', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'hints', 'late', '1960', 'song', 'Incense', 'Peppermints', 'group', 'Strawberry', 'Alarm', 'Clock.Filmed', 'Colorado', 'Rocky', 'Mountains', 'outdoor', 'cinematography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'However', 'film', 'chaotic', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'unrealistic', 'not', 'particularly', 'funny', 'characters', 'detracted', 'film', 'attempt', 'be', 'entertaining', 'western', 'spoof', 'Surprisingly', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'received', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Actress-Musical/Comedy', 'work', 'Duchess', 'Dirtwater', 'Fox', 'award', 'went', 'instead', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'A', 'Star', 'Born', 'Goldie', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'funny', 'scenes', 'funny', 'song', 'moments', 'acting', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'roles', 'films', 'such', 'Cactus', 'Flower', '1969', 'Butterflies', 'are', 'Free', '1972', 'Foul', 'Play', '1978', 'Private', 'Benjamin', '1980', 'later', 'works', 'Consequently', 'rating', 'Duchess', 'Dirtwater', 'Fox', 'generous', '3', '5', 'stars']",N/A

There are views of the Colorado Mountains all throughout this film. In the beginning of the movie George Segal is being hung for cheating at cards. The hanging scene was filmed behind the Hamill House in Georgetown Colorado in 1975.  I was seven years old and remember George Segal being there. My father was a deputy sheriff in charge of security. There were crowds watching from the parking lot behind the Hamill House. The horse comes running through the arch between the Carraige House and Hamill's office.  The production then moved to Central City where they turned it into the San Francisco Wharf and Virginia City.  There are Central City and Colorado landmarks everywhere in the film.

265758,AA6IC97YZHN13,6301777468,T. Pawels,"[1, 1]","Born 56 years ago in  Maryland, Goldie Hawn is type-cast as the skinny, ditzy blonde of LAUGH-IN.  Of her 28 movies listed by MALTIN, she plays to type best in the farcical assassination plot of FOUL PLAY.  Actually, Ms. Hawn has an extensive acting range with serious dramatic accomplishment, as she demonstrates in her mystery suspense thriller, DECEIVED.Ms. Hawn chooses scripts with a poignant moral, consummated at the end of PROTOCOL by her passionate plea for citizens to participate in democracy, recalling Charlie Chaplin's emotional prayer for compassion at the end of THE GREAT DICTATOR.  The heartfelt messages of her movies is the probable reason for consistently satisfied  fans.George Segal is cast with Goldie as THE DUCHESS AND THE DIRTWATER FOX, a comedy only because the characters are not distressed by their predicaments, including bullet wounds in the upper body.  Comic relief does not make a fun fest; a Western played for laughs throughout is THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL starring Burt Lancaster with Lee Remick, not to mention Mel Brooks' classic BLAZING SADDLES.Through a series of contrived crises, two long hilarious scenes and five repartees lighten the serious love story of lonely, selfish, opportunistic, and desperate scoundrels, like Scarlett and Rhett.  The critical shot is the moment they realize they love each other while dancing at a Jewish wedding; don't miss their faces during those 5 seconds at the beginning of the Third Act; the whole movie hangs on it.  The story ends with their romantic consummation, but persists through three more sequences with faulty continuity and unsatisfying resolution.Ms. Hawn has no figure, but she passes no opportunity for teasing with all she has without showing skin that never gets tan.  Her thighs are delightfully photogenic; THE DUCHESS displays them in crotch shots that would shame Sharon Stone because they are gratuitous.  Goldie's fans will appreciate the striking beauty of her mature face without make-up in the scene of her staked out to die with sarcastic witticisms under the desert sun.TP",4,The Dirt Comes Out In The Wash,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,2076,"['Born', '56', 'years', 'ago', 'Maryland', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'type-cast', 'skinny', 'ditzy', 'blonde', 'LAUGH-IN', '28', 'movies', 'listed', 'MALTIN', 'type', 'best', 'farcical', 'assassination', 'plot', 'FOUL', 'PLAY', 'Actually', 'Ms.', 'Hawn', 'extensive', 'acting', 'range', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'accomplishment', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'DECEIVED.Ms', 'Hawn', 'scripts', 'poignant', 'moral', 'consummated', 'end', 'PROTOCOL', 'passionate', 'plea', 'citizens', 'participate', 'democracy', 'recalling', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'emotional', 'prayer', 'compassion', 'end', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'DICTATOR', 'heartfelt', 'messages', 'movies', 'probable', 'reason', 'consistently', 'satisfied', 'fans.George', 'Segal', 'cast', 'Goldie', 'THE', 'DUCHESS', 'AND', 'THE', 'DIRTWATER', 'FOX', 'comedy', 'only', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'distressed', 'predicaments', 'including', 'bullet', 'wounds', 'upper', 'body', 'Comic', 'relief', 'not', 'make', 'fun', 'fest', 'Western', 'played', 'laughs', 'THE', 'HALLELUJAH', 'TRAIL', 'starring', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'not', 'mention', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'classic', 'BLAZING', 'SADDLES.Through', 'series', 'contrived', 'crises', 'two', 'long', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'five', 'repartees', 'lighten', 'serious', 'love', 'story', 'lonely', 'selfish', 'opportunistic', 'desperate', 'scoundrels', 'Scarlett', 'Rhett', 'critical', 'shot', 'moment', 'realize', 'love', 'other', 'dancing', 'Jewish', 'wedding', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', '5', 'seconds', 'beginning', 'Third', 'Act', 'whole', 'movie', 'hangs', 'story', 'romantic', 'consummation', 'three', 'more', 'sequences', 'faulty', 'continuity', 'unsatisfying', 'resolution.Ms', 'Hawn', 'figure', 'opportunity', 'teasing', 'showing', 'skin', 'never', 'tan', 'thighs', 'are', 'delightfully', 'photogenic', 'THE', 'DUCHESS', 'crotch', 'shots', 'would', 'shame', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'are', 'gratuitous', 'Goldie', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'striking', 'beauty', 'mature', 'face', 'make-up', 'scene', 'staked', 'out', 'die', 'sarcastic', 'witticisms', 'desert', 'sun.TP']",N/A
