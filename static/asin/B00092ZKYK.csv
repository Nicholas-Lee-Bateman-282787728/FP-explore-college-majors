900039,AIMR915K4YCN,B00092ZKYK,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[2, 2]","THE ALIEN ATTACK COLLECTION consists of three uber-cheeze classics- BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS, MISSILE TO THE MOON, CAT-WOMEN OF THE MOON, and one total dog-log- THE DAY IT COMES TO EARTH. BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS stars John Agar (TARANTULA, JOURNEY TO THE 7TH PLANET, INVISIBLE INVADERS) as a scientist possessed by an eeevil -and quite randy- alien brain named Gor. Agar devours any scenery in his path, like a super-charged termite in this masterwork! Meanwhile, a good alien brain named Vol takes up residence in the family dog. Can Vol stop Gor before Agar does that disturbing laugh again? Brrr! MISSILE TO THE MOON has lunar babes in swimsuits, high-heels, and huge head-dresses. Can the male visitors from Earth resist their wiles? Will the obligatory earth-women ever get their hair and make-up right? CAT-WOMEN OF THE MOON is pretty much MISSILE TO THE MOON's goofier twin. More moon-goddesses (in cat-suits), rock monsters, and giant, spider-pillows-on-wires abound. THE DAY IT COMES TO EARTH (aka: THE DAY IT CAME TO EARTH) is the ridiculous tale of a murdered man brought back to life by a strange meteorite. He crawls from a swamp, wanders around, and that's about it. George Goebel (!!) is in it, along w/ intergalactic megastar, Wink Roberts! The movie is the equivalent of self-immolation...",4,"BRAINS, BABES, AND EXTRA-CHEEEZE!...",1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,1305,"['ALIEN', 'ATTACK', 'COLLECTION', 'three', 'uber-cheeze', 'classics-', 'BRAIN', 'FROM', 'PLANET', 'AROUS', 'MISSILE', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOON', 'CAT-WOMEN', 'THE', 'MOON', 'one', 'total', 'dog-log-', 'DAY', 'IT', 'COMES', 'TO', 'EARTH', 'BRAIN', 'FROM', 'PLANET', 'AROUS', 'John', 'Agar', 'TARANTULA', 'JOURNEY', 'TO', 'THE', '7TH', 'PLANET', 'INVISIBLE', 'INVADERS', 'scientist', 'possessed', 'eeevil', '-and', 'quite', 'randy-', 'alien', 'brain', 'named', 'Gor', 'Agar', 'scenery', 'path', 'super-charged', 'termite', 'masterwork', 'Meanwhile', 'good', 'alien', 'brain', 'named', 'Vol', 'up', 'residence', 'family', 'dog', 'Can', 'Vol', 'stop', 'Gor', 'Agar', 'disturbing', 'laugh', 'again', 'Brrr', 'MISSILE', 'THE', 'MOON', 'lunar', 'babes', 'swimsuits', 'high-heels', 'huge', 'head-dresses', 'Can', 'male', 'visitors', 'Earth', 'resist', 'wiles', 'Will', 'obligatory', 'earth-women', 'ever', 'get', 'hair', 'make-up', 'right', 'CAT-WOMEN', 'THE', 'MOON', 'pretty', 'much', 'MISSILE', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOON', 'goofier', 'twin', 'More', 'moon-goddesses', 'cat-suits', 'rock', 'monsters', 'giant', 'spider-pillows-on-wires', 'abound', 'DAY', 'IT', 'COMES', 'TO', 'EARTH', 'aka', 'DAY', 'IT', 'CAME', 'TO', 'EARTH', 'ridiculous', 'tale', 'murdered', 'man', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'strange', 'meteorite', 'swamp', 'wanders', 'George', 'Goebel', 'w/', 'intergalactic', 'megastar', 'Wink', 'Roberts', 'movie', 'equivalent', 'self-immolation']",Alien Attack: (Brain From Planet Arous / Cat-Women Of the Moon / Missile To the Moon / The Day It Comes To Earth)

The Flying Saucers, or War of the Worlds, or even Invaders From Mars, are still worthy additions to anyone's canon of what goes for classic science-fiction.  Sure, the sets move when the actors bump them in Catwomen, and the so-called Brain is barely believable in Planet Arous, and the sets still move in Missile To The Moon, and the acting of The Day It Came To Earth has to be seen to be believed, but what is required here (as even in Star Wars) is a suspension of disbelief.  It seems to me that as movies get more sophisticated with  the special effects, there isn't as much of a challenge being demanded of with our imaginations.  It's as if the work is being done for us.  See these movies not for their flaws, but for the light and shadow of mystery that is still in each one---even if you have to look a little harder than Close Encounters of the Third Kind to find it . . .",4,A rocket blast from the golden past.,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,962,"['Forgive', 'rap', 'movies', 'not', 'eye-popping', 'ilk', 'Earth', 'Vs', 'Flying', 'Saucers', 'War', 'Worlds', 'even', 'Invaders', 'Mars', 'are', 'still', 'worthy', 'additions', 'anyone', 'canon', 'what', 'classic', 'science-fiction', 'Sure', 'sets', 'move', 'when', 'actors', 'bump', 'Catwomen', 'so-called', 'Brain', 'barely', 'believable', 'Planet', 'Arous', 'sets', 'still', 'move', 'Missile', 'Moon', 'acting', 'Day', 'Came', 'Earth', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'what', 'required', 'here', 'even', 'Star', 'Wars', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'movies', 'get', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'special', 'effects', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'challenge', 'being', 'demanded', 'imaginations', 'work', 'being', 'done', 'See', 'movies', 'not', 'flaws', 'light', 'shadow', 'mystery', 'still', 'one', '-even', 'have', 'look', 'little', 'harder', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'find']",Alien Attack: (Brain From Planet Arous / Cat-Women Of the Moon / Missile To the Moon / The Day It Comes To Earth)

This is the first time I've ever seen multiple discs packaged like that.I basically got this set because of one movie; &#34;The Brain from Plant Arous&#34;. I have a couple of other old Sci-Fi movies with John Agar in them (&#34;Tarantula&#34; and &#34;Revenge of the Creature&#34;), and he is a likable actor and is good in these movies.Despite Agar and a pleasant Joyce Meadows, the movie seems to have been written by some grade school kids.Yeah I know the reason we all like these old Sci-Fi movies are because they are kind of &#34;corny&#34;, but this one is just goes way past that. The characters don't react as &#34;normal&#34; people would and the movie just suddenly ends with a lot of unanswered questions. Not unanswered because the writer was trying to make us think about the ending, but because the writer just gave up and ended it.Granted, it doesn't go to the extreme of &#34;Plan 9 From Outer Space&#34;, but close.And most of the special effects are close to being something that was done in someone's basement. &#34;Try to hide the wires holding up things please!&#34;I haven't watched the other three movies yet. This first one isn't remastered and it has some film flaws, but it isn't bad at all. The discs seem to all have been produced with a relatively descent level of quality, for what they are.I'll post some more comments when I've watched the other three discs.",3,It's just Okay........,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,1477,"['four', 'movies', 'are', 'four', 'separate', 'discs', 'are', 'stacked', 'one', 'top', 'other', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'multiple', 'discs', 'packaged', 'that.I', 'basically', 'got', 'set', 'one', 'movie', '34', 'Brain', 'Plant', 'Arous', '34', 'have', 'couple', 'other', 'old', 'Sci-Fi', 'movies', 'John', 'Agar', '34', 'Tarantula', '34', '34', 'Revenge', 'Creature', '34', 'likable', 'actor', 'good', 'movies.Despite', 'Agar', 'pleasant', 'Joyce', 'Meadows', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'grade', 'school', 'kids.Yeah', 'know', 'reason', 'old', 'Sci-Fi', 'movies', 'are', 'are', 'kind', '34', 'corny', '34', 'one', 'just', 'way', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'react', '34', 'normal', '34', 'people', 'would', 'movie', 'just', 'suddenly', 'lot', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'Not', 'unanswered', 'writer', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'think', 'ending', 'writer', 'just', 'gave', 'up', 'ended', 'it.Granted', ""n't"", 'go', 'extreme', '34', 'Plan', '9', 'From', 'Outer', 'Space', '34', 'most', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'close', 'being', 'something', 'was', 'done', 'someone', 'basement', '34', 'Try', 'hide', 'wires', 'holding', 'up', 'things', 'please', '34', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'other', 'three', 'movies', 'yet', 'first', 'one', ""n't"", 'remastered', 'film', 'flaws', ""n't"", 'bad', 'discs', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'relatively', 'descent', 'level', 'quality', 'what', 'are.I', ""'ll"", 'post', 'more', 'comments', 'when', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'other', 'three', 'discs']",Alien Attack: (Brain From Planet Arous / Cat-Women Of the Moon / Missile To the Moon / The Day It Comes To Earth)
