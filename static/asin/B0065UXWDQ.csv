So I identified with the main character also because I found him to be a nice guy. Maybe that is partly why I liked the movie so much. This may not be the same with you.Overall, I thought the story was both good and original. The movie starts off that the hero's horoscope predicts he will have a great day, a 5 star day. The day turns out to be a disaster. Needing a subject for his course, he decides his subject will be to prove that astrology is nonsense. So off his adventures start as he goes and interview's people who have the same star sign as he does. It is a light story, but it does have its moments. I did like his speech that we make our own future.The characters were good, interesting and believable.The acting, I thought was very good. I liked everyones' performance.The filming was good too.Would I see it again, probably not as I have seen it, and it is not that deep that I feel I need too, but I do recommend it!",5,An enjoyable and orginal light movie,1331683200,"03 14, 2012",2012,1079,"['Warning', 'firstly', 'do', 'lot', 'research', 'work', 'often', 'find', 'character', 'having', 'data', 'views', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'identified', 'main', 'character', 'also', 'found', 'be', 'nice', 'guy', 'Maybe', 'partly', 'why', 'liked', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'you.Overall', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'original', 'movie', 'hero', 'horoscope', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'day', '5', 'star', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'be', 'disaster', 'Needing', 'subject', 'course', 'subject', 'will', 'be', 'prove', 'astrology', 'nonsense', 'So', 'adventures', 'start', 'interview', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'same', 'star', 'sign', 'light', 'story', 'have', 'moments', 'did', 'like', 'speech', 'make', 'own', 'future.The', 'characters', 'were', 'good', 'interesting', 'believable.The', 'acting', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'liked', 'everyones', 'performance.The', 'filming', 'was', 'good', 'too.Would', 'see', 'again', 'probably', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'not', 'deep', 'feel', 'need', 'too', 'do', 'recommend']",N/A

Teslovich,"[0, 4]","Positive:The story premise had potential in terms of evaluating the predictive efficacy of astrology by examining the relatively close in time and location births and lives of a group of people.Negatives:Four lives is not statistically significant (need a whole lot more) as shown by flipping a coin four times and if three or four of those times are heads in a row that does not indicate fate or divine intervention. Overall just too much Hollywood pop psychology mixed with the usual Hollywood versions of tragedy with romantic interest to satisfy producer demands for market share and paying the bills.Acting seemed too made-up, unreal. Gigandet didn't look like anything but a model posing for the camera. The always just-got-out-of-bed look is getting overdone old and his little twirls when getting into an elevator and when drunk were just laughable. Not realistic regular folk normal.Usual indicators of cheap and quick movie making: No subtitles for people with hearing/language issues; 25 songs spaced throughout as a crutch to carry the viewer through a lot of boredom; 74 special thanks to cut corners.",2,Pop Psych,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,1114,"['Positive', 'story', 'premise', 'had', 'potential', 'terms', 'evaluating', 'predictive', 'efficacy', 'astrology', 'examining', 'relatively', 'close', 'time', 'location', 'births', 'lives', 'group', 'people.Negatives', 'Four', 'lives', 'not', 'statistically', 'significant', 'need', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'shown', 'flipping', 'coin', 'four', 'times', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'are', 'heads', 'row', 'not', 'indicate', 'fate', 'divine', 'intervention', 'Overall', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'pop', 'psychology', 'mixed', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'versions', 'tragedy', 'romantic', 'interest', 'satisfy', 'producer', 'demands', 'market', 'share', 'paying', 'bills.Acting', 'seemed', 'too', 'made-up', 'unreal', 'Gigandet', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'model', 'posing', 'camera', 'always', 'just-got-out-of-bed', 'look', 'getting', 'overdone', 'old', 'little', 'twirls', 'when', 'getting', 'elevator', 'when', 'drunk', 'were', 'just', 'laughable', 'Not', 'realistic', 'regular', 'folk', 'normal.Usual', 'indicators', 'cheap', 'quick', 'movie', 'making', 'subtitles', 'people', 'hearing/language', 'issues', '25', 'songs', 'spaced', 'crutch', 'carry', 'viewer', 'lot', 'boredom', '74', 'special', 'thanks', 'cut', 'corners']",N/A

1510784,A3TD7HLTDWZ382,B0065UXWDQ,"Pikminfan ""bobsworld3""","[8, 8]","Though it's not exactly going to blow anyone's mind-""Five Star Day"" is still a very thought provoking and smartly made movie. It starts with an interesting premise about astrology and whether or not there is some significance to the astrological circumstances a person is born under or whether it's all just one big crock. In the film, the protagonist (played by Cam Gigandet) essentially takes it upon himself to track down two women and one man born in the same hospital he was who also share his same birth date to see whether or not their collective recent birthday experiences mirror his own. What got me the most about ""Five Star Day"" was that it seemed to tread new ground and that alone is a commendable quality. It also has its share of likable and surprising characters, most of which I found myself growing easily sympathetic toward. A really good movie should leave you thinking about it long after it's finished. What did it mean? What do I take away from it? That's exactly what this film did for me. There are some personal lessons to be learned here if you're open to them. I recommend ""Five Star Day"" for some night when you're thinking about the significance of your life and where your place is in the universe. I think I saw this film classified somewhere on this page as a ""comedy"". Trust me, it is NOT a comedy, nor is it a super heavy drama. It's really just an interesting film about self discovery.",4,Probably more of a four star day...but still very good,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,1423,"['not', 'exactly', 'going', 'blow', 'anyone', 'mind-', 'Five', 'Star', 'Day', 'still', 'very', 'thought', 'provoking', 'smartly', 'made', 'movie', 'interesting', 'premise', 'astrology', 'not', 'significance', 'astrological', 'circumstances', 'person', 'born', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'crock', 'film', 'protagonist', 'played', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'essentially', 'track', 'down', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'man', 'born', 'same', 'hospital', 'was', 'who', 'also', 'share', 'same', 'birth', 'date', 'see', 'not', 'collective', 'recent', 'birthday', 'mirror', 'own', 'What', 'got', 'most', 'Five', 'Star', 'Day', 'was', 'seemed', 'tread', 'new', 'ground', 'alone', 'commendable', 'quality', 'also', 'share', 'likable', 'surprising', 'characters', 'most', 'found', 'growing', 'easily', 'sympathetic', 'A', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'should', 'leave', 'thinking', 'long', 'finished', 'What', 'did', 'mean', 'What', 'do', 'take', 'away', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'did', 'are', 'personal', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'here', ""'re"", 'open', 'recommend', 'Five', 'Star', 'Day', 'night', 'when', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'significance', 'life', 'where', 'place', 'universe', 'think', 'saw', 'film', 'classified', 'somewhere', 'page', 'comedy', 'Trust', 'NOT', 'comedy', 'super', 'heavy', 'drama', 'really', 'just', 'interesting', 'film', 'self', 'discovery']",N/A
