1054825,ACX8YW2D5EGP6,B000NA1PUG,"Alexandra Stephens ""dreamgirl0922""","[11, 16]","I love one tree hill. it's like 90210 but just a bit more modern. But this past season...while it had some great moments and a somewhat interesting storyline it had it's weaknesses as well.*Spoilers*It opens with the ending of season 3. Nathan has just jumped into save his uncle and Rachel. Luke and Karen pull up and find Haley screaming for Nathan who hasn't come up for air. Luke jumps in to find Nathan and only manages to find cooper. They look over to the side and see Nathan with Rachel in his arms. Alright that's fine. He saved the day YAY! But then it takes an interesting twist. Nathan starts to believe that it was Keith who passed away last season, that saved them. Weird. Then it gets even more confusing. Brooke is the one that everyone thought was pregnant, but in a somewhat shocking (not if you've watched the ending of season 3 and know what's happening in 4) change of events it's actually Haley who is pregnant. Well apparently she isn't that far along. Okay that's cool...but alright now I'm gonna skip ahead a little. The gang finds out that Peyton  has a brother who she just found out about. That is the creepy freak named Derek. Well Lucas of course doesn't like him at all. She finally calls him and he hangs up on her. Then the next day he's at her door telling her that she just scared him a little but he wants to get to know her. Meanwhile Brooke has broken up with Lucas and is heartbroken when she sees him with Peyton who last season told Brooke that she had feelings for Lucas. So the stuff between Peyton and Derek keeps going and you start to think he's a great guy...who likes to take pics of his sister...way too much. Turns out he's a stalker and he tries to rape Peyton. However Lucas, who had been trying to get Derek caught by the cops, and the real Derek come to Peyton's rescue. This leads to this wonderful episode when Peyton's real brother takes her to his base and teaches her how defend herself (one of the best scenes is when she breaks down). Finally Peyton moves on the guys win the championships. There is also a side story where Nathan gets involved with a gambler and it gets so bad that at the championship game he tells Nathan to throw the game so he can win. But he finds out from Haley after half time that they're having a son so he decides to win the game instead. After the game they're all celebrating the win...Lucas is celebrating the fact that him and Peyton are getting together...when Haley gets hit by a car that was intended for Nathan and Lucas has a heart attack because he wasn't taking his medication during the game and the shock of seeing Haley is too much for him to take. They both live and in one of the best episodes of the season Lucas sees Keith who takes him around and shows him what life would be like if he didn't do half the things that he does (once again proving that the show is really about Lucas). Things stay good for a while after that until the night before the prom when Nathan and Haley throw a party and an old sex tape that stars Nathan and Brooke is show and Peyton learns for the first time that when she was dating Nathan, Brooke slept with him. This causes Peyton to tell Brooke that they're over and they have one of the most hilarious cat fights ever. That night when Lucas comes to pick up Peyton from the prom she doesn't answer. Turns out earlier in the night she went to answer the door thinking it was Lucas and it turned out to be Stalker Derek again who ties her up and decides to have his own little prom in her basement. Brooke goes to the prom and gets pissed when she sees Lucas all alone so she goes to find Peyton and the two of them end up kicking the crap out of stalker Derek and they decide to stick together. The season keeps going with more stuff that just was thrown in there until the end when Lucas figures out, with the help of diabetic Abby, that Dan shot Keith. And when Dan is at his house dinner with Karen he pulls a gun on Dan and Karen collapses. She gets taken to the hospital and before graduation the doctors perform a c-section to save both Karen and the baby. The kids go to Graduation and Haley's water breaks during the speech. The final episode starts off with Haley giving birth and the doctors trying to revive Karen. Karen has a little Keith visit and she meets her daughter. The doctors revive her as Lucas looks on with a relieved smile on his face. Meanwhile Haley gives birth to a son who she names James Lucas Scott.  The story shifts to two weeks later when the group is saying goodbye to each other at a party thrown by Rachel. In the end they all decide to come back to the river court in 4 years.This season had great moments. But there were some really confusing moments as well. Like the time line for Haley's pregnancy. It didn't make any season. But whatever it's tv right. Anyway this is a great season if you love one tree hill. I for one am going to have it the day it comes out. But that's because i love one tree hill. Anyway see you guys the first week of January for season 5!",3,An alright season not the best though.,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,5044,"['love', 'one', 'tree', 'hill', '90210', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'modern', 'past', 'season', 'had', 'great', 'moments', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'had', 'weaknesses', 'as', 'well', '*Spoilers*It', 'ending', 'season', '3', 'Nathan', 'just', 'jumped', 'save', 'uncle', 'Rachel', 'Luke', 'Karen', 'pull', 'up', 'find', 'Haley', 'screaming', 'Nathan', 'who', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'air', 'Luke', 'find', 'Nathan', 'only', 'find', 'cooper', 'look', 'side', 'see', 'Nathan', 'Rachel', 'arms', 'Alright', 'fine', 'saved', 'day', 'YAY', 'then', 'interesting', 'twist', 'believe', 'was', 'Keith', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'last', 'season', 'saved', 'Weird', 'Then', 'even', 'more', 'confusing', 'Brooke', 'one', 'everyone', 'thought', 'was', 'pregnant', 'somewhat', 'shocking', 'not', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'ending', 'season', '3', 'know', 'what', 'happening', '4', 'change', 'events', 'actually', 'Haley', 'who', 'pregnant', 'Well', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'far', 'along', 'Okay', 'cool', 'alright', 'now', ""'m"", 'gon', 'skip', 'ahead', 'little', 'gang', 'out', 'Peyton', 'brother', 'who', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'about', 'creepy', 'freak', 'named', 'Derek', 'Well', 'Lucas', 'course', ""n't"", 'like', 'finally', 'up', 'Then', 'next', 'day', 'door', 'telling', 'just', 'scared', 'little', 'get', 'know', 'Meanwhile', 'Brooke', 'broken', 'up', 'Lucas', 'heartbroken', 'when', 'Peyton', 'who', 'last', 'season', 'told', 'Brooke', 'had', 'feelings', 'Lucas', 'stuff', 'Peyton', 'Derek', 'going', 'start', 'think', 'great', 'guy', 'who', 'take', 'pics', 'sister', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'out', 'stalker', 'rape', 'Peyton', 'However', 'Lucas', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'trying', 'get', 'Derek', 'caught', 'cops', 'real', 'Derek', 'come', 'Peyton', 'rescue', 'wonderful', 'episode', 'when', 'Peyton', 'real', 'brother', 'base', 'how', 'defend', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'when', 'down', 'Finally', 'Peyton', 'guys', 'win', 'championships', 'also', 'side', 'story', 'where', 'Nathan', 'involved', 'gambler', 'so', 'bad', 'championship', 'game', 'Nathan', 'throw', 'game', 'can', 'win', 'out', 'Haley', 'half', 'time', ""'re"", 'having', 'son', 'so', 'win', 'game', 'instead', 'game', ""'re"", 'celebrating', 'win', 'Lucas', 'celebrating', 'fact', 'Peyton', 'are', 'getting', 'together', 'when', 'Haley', 'hit', 'car', 'was', 'intended', 'Nathan', 'Lucas', 'heart', 'attack', 'was', ""n't"", 'taking', 'medication', 'game', 'shock', 'seeing', 'Haley', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'live', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'Lucas', 'Keith', 'who', 'around', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'things', 'once', 'again', 'proving', 'show', 'really', 'Lucas', 'Things', 'stay', 'good', 'while', 'night', 'prom', 'when', 'Nathan', 'Haley', 'throw', 'party', 'old', 'sex', 'tape', 'stars', 'Nathan', 'Brooke', 'show', 'Peyton', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'dating', 'Nathan', 'Brooke', 'slept', 'Peyton', 'tell', 'Brooke', ""'re"", 'have', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', 'cat', 'fights', 'ever', 'night', 'when', 'Lucas', 'pick', 'up', 'Peyton', 'prom', ""n't"", 'answer', 'out', 'earlier', 'night', 'went', 'answer', 'door', 'thinking', 'was', 'Lucas', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Stalker', 'Derek', 'again', 'who', 'up', 'decides', 'have', 'own', 'little', 'prom', 'basement', 'Brooke', 'prom', 'pissed', 'when', 'Lucas', 'alone', 'find', 'Peyton', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'kicking', 'crap', 'stalker', 'Derek', 'decide', 'stick', 'together', 'season', 'going', 'more', 'stuff', 'just', 'was', 'thrown', 'there', 'end', 'when', 'Lucas', 'out', 'help', 'diabetic', 'Abby', 'Dan', 'shot', 'Keith', 'when', 'Dan', 'house', 'dinner', 'Karen', 'gun', 'Dan', 'Karen', 'taken', 'hospital', 'graduation', 'doctors', 'perform', 'c-section', 'save', 'Karen', 'baby', 'kids', 'go', 'Graduation', 'Haley', 'water', 'breaks', 'speech', 'final', 'episode', 'Haley', 'giving', 'birth', 'doctors', 'trying', 'revive', 'Karen', 'Karen', 'little', 'Keith', 'visit', 'daughter', 'doctors', 'revive', 'Lucas', 'relieved', 'smile', 'face', 'Meanwhile', 'Haley', 'birth', 'son', 'who', 'James', 'Lucas', 'Scott', 'story', 'shifts', 'two', 'weeks', 'later', 'when', 'group', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'other', 'party', 'thrown', 'Rachel', 'end', 'decide', 'come', 'back', 'river', 'court', '4', 'years.This', 'season', 'had', 'great', 'moments', 'were', 'really', 'confusing', 'moments', 'well', 'time', 'line', 'Haley', 'pregnancy', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'season', 'whatever', 'tv', 'right', 'Anyway', 'great', 'season', 'love', 'one', 'tree', 'hill', 'one', 'am', 'going', 'have', 'day', 'out', 'i', 'love', 'one', 'tree', 'hill', 'Anyway', 'see', 'guys', 'first', 'week', 'January', 'season', '5']",One Tree Hill: Season 4

I finished season 4 yesterday and it was terrific just like the first three seasons. Lots of cliffhangers this season and it never seems to let up once. The actors all do a good job too, and everyone is likeable in their own way or entertaining to watch. Hilarie Burton (Peyton) in particular is a real standout this season, and Sophia Bush (Brooke) and James Lafferty (Nathan) continue to be two of the very best characters.We also get some supporting characters who finally become regulars ( Daneel Harris as Rachel and Antwon Tanner as Skills), and some new characters (the very cute Stephen Colletti as Brooke's new boyfriend Chase).This season deals with Peyton being terrorized by a stalker, Dan being haunted by his own demons (and by someone who knows what really happened to Keith), Nathan getting into a mess of problems when he just tries to be a good husband and find ways to pay the bills, Brooke finding new enemies, boyfriends, and friendships (not all turn out to be positives) and Deb having to deal with a pretty bad drug addiction.I've yet to be letdown by a season of this show, and I can't wait to watch the next.

The Bottom line is the first ten episodes rocked and was a great season in and of itself.The second half however, is another story. The show struggle for a clear path and fell flat because of it. Alot of filler episodes were created that had no momentum and  almost felt like they were borrowed from a reality show script. A Prom arc was covered in four episodes with mixed results. Although it did provide a reunion for one of the show most beloved friendships. The damage was done. Tree hill twisted and stalled in a direction that only let the series show its age.. The last two episodes were the shows only redemption and sent Tree back to its roots.If your a hardcore fan, you'll love the first ten episodes, they feel like season three. But discard the rest.
