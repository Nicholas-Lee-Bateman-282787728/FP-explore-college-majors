Wondered how the special effects were done, then realized these were real people.  Was more curious about the oddball aspects.

It's still hilarious, and it's the kind of movie that makes me happy to be alive and a movie watcher.This movie is about a guy with no arms and a guy with horribly withered legs who team up to learn kung-fu and fight evil. The legless guy at one point jumps on the armless guy's shoulders during a fight. In several occasions, the armless guy twirls stick with his very bony arm stump, and even punches people (don't ask). Was there a plot? Oh, who knows. I was too caught up in the depravity of it all.The DVD is in the aspect ratio of 1.33:1, which means it's probably in pan-and-scan. For you two or three people out there who want to catch &quot;every inch&quot; of &quot;The Crippled Masters,&quot; then you'll have to wait for a better version. There are a few cheesy special features included: a crappy photo gallery (just a few stills from the movie), some info about the cast, a page of production notes (the same stuff that's on the back of the box) and a page of 'trivia' (more production notes, this time in point form).

404865,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,6304162103,Robert I. Hedges,"[0, 0]","""The Crippled Masters"" is a startling train wreck of a movie. This disgusting and disturbing novelty stars a man with no arms and a man with no legs who band together into a kung fu powerhouse, frequently using the dreaded and unique ""piggyback ride"" brand of martial mayhem. The film stars Frankie Shum, whose mother took thalidomide while pregnant; as a result Frankie was born without arms. In the film the sadistic ""Master"" orders his arms chopped off for some perceived slight, and Jackie Conn is just the man for the job. Frankie has surprisingly little bleeding (and no shock) from having his arms sliced off, but his life quickly degenerates, and reaches a new low in a restaurant where he is taunted by the wait staff. (The chicken eating scene is especially odious.) Eventually Frankie is rescued from the pointless terrorizing by a coffin salesman (!) who takes him under his wing.After Frankie gets a job as a farmhand (you'll please excuse the unfortunate pun,) we rapidly cut to the Master and Jackie who are having a tiff over a drinking custom. The Master (whose dubbed voice sounds like a combination of Elmer Fudd and Snidely Whiplash) is a tad intolerant and pours acid on Jackie's legs, making them shriveled and useless (in reality he too was born with a birth defect.) The dynamic duo is formally introduced when Jackie conveniently falls down a hill that Frankie is working at the bottom of. They obviously have some mutual animosity given their past, but quickly decide to team up to defeat the Master.Frankie and Jackie meet a mystical old man in a basket with his legs behind his neck in a cave. (Don't ask.) He stresses teamwork and volunteers to take them on as kung fu students. The bulk of the remainder of the film is taken up with footage of training (with eggs, rocks, and sticks) and vengeance on the Master and his associates. There's even a little sweet chicken-related revenge in the restaurant.The kung fu scenes are quite a spectacle: obviously they don't have the moves of the greatest martial arts practitioners, but what they actually can do is astounding; I especially liked the piggyback pole fight (complete with weird ""Ultraman""-type sound effects) with the Master, where (obviously) good overcomes evil in the finale. Don't look away, because once the Master goes down, the film ends very abruptly.The film is interesting (like a train wreck, it's ugly, but I couldn't look away,) though frequently annoying. The odd and overwrought music is a constant irritation, the sound effects are frequently out of place, the dubbing is atrocious, and the whole thing reeks of exploitation. I actually felt sorry for Frankie and Jackie for their deformities, and admired them for overcoming them often in amazing ways, but at the end of the day the movie is just too predictable. I give it two stars, one each for Frankie and Jackie; beyond that there's not much to see here.",2,"""You're Strong Now, But The Day Will Come When You Get Your Desserts!""",1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,2912,"['Crippled', 'Masters', 'startling', 'train', 'wreck', 'movie', 'disgusting', 'disturbing', 'novelty', 'man', 'arms', 'man', 'legs', 'who', 'band', 'together', 'kung', 'fu', 'powerhouse', 'frequently', 'using', 'dreaded', 'unique', 'piggyback', 'ride', 'brand', 'martial', 'mayhem', 'film', 'stars', 'Frankie', 'Shum', 'mother', 'took', 'thalidomide', 'pregnant', 'result', 'Frankie', 'was', 'born', 'arms', 'film', 'sadistic', 'Master', 'orders', 'arms', 'chopped', 'off', 'perceived', 'slight', 'Jackie', 'Conn', 'just', 'man', 'job', 'Frankie', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'bleeding', 'shock', 'having', 'arms', 'sliced', 'off', 'life', 'quickly', 'new', 'low', 'restaurant', 'where', 'taunted', 'wait', 'staff', 'chicken', 'eating', 'scene', 'especially', 'odious', 'Eventually', 'Frankie', 'rescued', 'pointless', 'terrorizing', 'coffin', 'salesman', 'who', 'wing.After', 'Frankie', 'job', 'farmhand', ""'ll"", 'please', 'excuse', 'unfortunate', 'pun', 'rapidly', 'cut', 'Master', 'Jackie', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'tiff', 'drinking', 'custom', 'Master', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'sounds', 'combination', 'Elmer', 'Fudd', 'Snidely', 'Whiplash', 'tad', 'intolerant', 'pours', 'acid', 'Jackie', 'legs', 'making', 'shriveled', 'useless', 'reality', 'too', 'was', 'born', 'birth', 'defect', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'formally', 'introduced', 'when', 'Jackie', 'conveniently', 'down', 'hill', 'Frankie', 'working', 'bottom', 'obviously', 'have', 'mutual', 'animosity', 'given', 'past', 'quickly', 'decide', 'team', 'up', 'defeat', 'Master.Frankie', 'Jackie', 'meet', 'mystical', 'old', 'man', 'basket', 'legs', 'neck', 'cave', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'teamwork', 'volunteers', 'take', 'kung', 'fu', 'students', 'bulk', 'remainder', 'film', 'taken', 'up', 'footage', 'training', 'eggs', 'rocks', 'sticks', 'vengeance', 'Master', 'associates', 'even', 'little', 'sweet', 'chicken-related', 'revenge', 'restaurant.The', 'kung', 'fu', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'spectacle', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'moves', 'greatest', 'martial', 'arts', 'practitioners', 'what', 'actually', 'can', 'do', 'astounding', 'especially', 'liked', 'piggyback', 'pole', 'fight', 'complete', 'weird', 'Ultraman', '-type', 'sound', 'effects', 'Master', 'where', 'obviously', 'good', 'overcomes', 'evil', 'finale', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'Master', 'down', 'film', 'very', 'abruptly.The', 'film', 'interesting', 'train', 'wreck', 'ugly', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'frequently', 'annoying', 'odd', 'overwrought', 'music', 'constant', 'irritation', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'frequently', 'place', 'dubbing', 'atrocious', 'whole', 'thing', 'reeks', 'exploitation', 'actually', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Frankie', 'Jackie', 'deformities', 'admired', 'overcoming', 'often', 'amazing', 'ways', 'end', 'day', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'predictable', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'one', 'Frankie', 'Jackie', 'not', 'much', 'see', 'here']",Crippled Masters VHS
404866,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,6304162103,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[7, 8]","Movie Summary:  One man disobeys the evil master's orders and has his arms cut off and is thrown in the street while a second man helps.  Some time later the second man finally objects to the master's cruelty and the master destroys his legs with acid. Eventually these two crippled men meet and swear revenge. They meet up with an old man who teaches them how to fight again by complementing each other's strengths. With newfound confidence and the help of a government agent, they seek out the nearly invincible evil master who crippled them.My Opinion:  I heard about this Kung Fu classic many times on a popular Chicago Radio show. It wasn't available on DVD then. When it finally showed up on DVD, I had to grab it. This is a strange twist on the standard Kung Fu Movie plot of: Hero Wronged, Hero trains, Hero gets revenge. The twist is that both the crippled masters are disabled in real life. Frankie Shum has a tiny stump of one arm, and Jack Conn has useless shriveled legs.  It is very strange to see the master with no arms fight, eat, and twirl a staff. The other master spends most of the movie crawling around which isn't quite as weird but is still strange. The masters compliment each other well and the story is pretty good. I was amazed, freaked out, and entertained all at the same time.DVD Quality:  The DVD contains Chapter Selection, Cast and Crew, Film Facts, Facts and Trivia, and Photo Gallery. The Audio is dubbed in English. The video is not too bad.What You Should Do:  Buy this one for you Kung Fu collection. The price is right, and it's a gem that needs to be included in all collections.Related Movies To Check Out:  Crippled Avengers, Crippled Heroes, The Five Deadly Venoms, Shaolin Challenges Ninja",4,"No Arms, No Legs, No Problem!",1076457600,"02 11, 2004",2004,1734,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'One', 'man', 'evil', 'master', 'orders', 'arms', 'cut', 'off', 'thrown', 'street', 'second', 'man', 'time', 'later', 'second', 'man', 'finally', 'master', 'cruelty', 'master', 'legs', 'acid', 'Eventually', 'two', 'crippled', 'men', 'meet', 'swear', 'revenge', 'meet', 'up', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'how', 'fight', 'again', 'complementing', 'other', 'strengths', 'newfound', 'confidence', 'help', 'government', 'agent', 'seek', 'out', 'nearly', 'invincible', 'evil', 'master', 'who', 'crippled', 'them.My', 'Opinion', 'heard', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'classic', 'many', 'times', 'popular', 'Chicago', 'Radio', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'DVD', 'then', 'When', 'finally', 'showed', 'up', 'DVD', 'had', 'grab', 'strange', 'twist', 'standard', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Movie', 'plot', 'Hero', 'Wronged', 'Hero', 'Hero', 'revenge', 'twist', 'crippled', 'masters', 'are', 'disabled', 'real', 'life', 'Frankie', 'Shum', 'tiny', 'stump', 'one', 'arm', 'Jack', 'Conn', 'useless', 'shriveled', 'legs', 'very', 'strange', 'see', 'master', 'arms', 'fight', 'eat', 'twirl', 'staff', 'other', 'master', 'most', 'movie', 'crawling', ""n't"", 'quite', 'weird', 'still', 'strange', 'masters', 'compliment', 'other', 'well', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'amazed', 'freaked', 'out', 'entertained', 'same', 'time.DVD', 'Quality', 'DVD', 'Chapter', 'Selection', 'Cast', 'Crew', 'Film', 'Facts', 'Facts', 'Trivia', 'Photo', 'Gallery', 'Audio', 'dubbed', 'English', 'video', 'not', 'too', 'Should', 'Do', 'Buy', 'one', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'collection', 'price', 'right', 'gem', 'be', 'included', 'collections.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'Crippled', 'Avengers', 'Crippled', 'Heroes', 'Five', 'Deadly', 'Venoms', 'Shaolin', 'Challenges', 'Ninja']",Crippled Masters VHS

This is the driving force in this movie.Nothing makes you want to kick the ""you know what"" of your enemy than to have your arms chopped off and thrown away as if they were yesterday's garbage.  The armless character played by Frankie Shum, must learn to deal with his handicap and not feel sorry for himself. He is helped by a stranger on a farm where he learns how to strengthen his legs and do farm work.But, here's the twist of fate!  The same man who carried out the order to have his arms chopped off (Jackie Conn), in turn had his legs burned off by acid for his punishment.  This is where the movie grabs you!  Yes, you've guessed it! Their paths cross again  - ""no arms"" meets ""burned off legs."" Frankie had the upper hand because he learned to work around his handicap and nearly beat Jackie to death because he was filled with rage.  Jackie tried to explain to Frankie that he was only carrying out the order made by the evil master.  An old man living in a cave intervened and persuades Frankie that he must learn to forgive and move on.  After he learns to forgive Jackie for having his arms cut off, they were taught kung fu by this same old man. They both vowed to get even with the evil master and later joined forces.This inexpensive flick is a true gem.  You would simply not believe the stunts you see these guys do.  The stunts weren't chopped up and made to look real.  The guy with this little two inch stub sticking out of his shoulder cavity swirls and swings a staff better than those having hands and arms.  This is totally real.  No big shirt with the arm tied or taped to the side - faking being crippled. You will see one with his shirt off and you can quickly tell where his arms used to be ""or never was"" and the other with extremely disformed legs.  I guarantee you will be using the rewind button on this one - you'll probably wear it out!  This kung fu flick is better than many I've seen where everyone had arms and legs.All I can say is don't sleep on this one.
