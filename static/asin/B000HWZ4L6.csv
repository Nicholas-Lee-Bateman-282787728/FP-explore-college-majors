1017221,A3DG93E8TXMKZF,B000HWZ4L6,"BytemanProofreader at Gmail ""JohnnyWill""","[0, 0]","This is one of my favorite series. I own all of the first three seasons, and will eventually purchase the rest. Tess, Monica and Andrew are angels who help people on Earth, sometimes secretly, sometimes letting people know they are angels. There are many excellent guest stars.--------- ARE THERE ANGELS TOUCHING US? ---------I know that angels work in our lives. Sometimes, our angels are human friends or strangers that help us when we need it, without their even knowing it. Sometimes, we act as angels, perhaps by an angelic nudge in our mind, to help strangers. Let me give two examples.*** I get touched by an angelic urge ***Years ago, while I was attending a convention at a campground in NW Arkansas, I felt the sudden urge to leave my laptop in an unlocked room in an unlocked building and go to chow by a route that I had never used before, walking through the worship center and out a door that was on the farthest side of the building from where I'd been working on my computer.When I get outside and partway down an empty path between buildings, I come across a crying tot. She was lost and looking for her parents. It was so far away from where I started, I couldn't have possibly heard her. I pick her up and carry her immediately to the chow hall, where I tell people that know the parents that I found her, and that we'll be eating.I know that God or an angel touched me that day, and used me as an angel in that young girl's life.*** When someone else is Touched by an Angel to come to my aid ***In 2012, my sister asked me to proofread her book,On Higher Ground. She mailed me the manuscript, and while I was a few pages into it, I realized that my paperback dictionary was not as good a reference as I'd hoped, so I wrote her a note asking her to order me a Collegiate dictionary.Before I could mail that letter, a friend walked up and asked me if I had a paperback dictionary. I said I did. He asked if I'd be willing to trade. He wanted a lighter dictionary that wasn't as heavy as his. I said YES, and what did he give me?Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (Laminated Cover)(the latest, eleventh edition).My friend had no idea that I needed that dictionary. I don't even think he knew I was proofreading Paula's book. It was about twelve hours AFTER I'd written the note to my sister.I believe than Henry was touched by an angel, because I was the first person he asked, when he decided he wanted to trade dictionaries, and he did it as an even swap.By the way, if you enjoy Touched by an Angel, I highly recommendOn Higher Groundby Paula Hrbacek. It is the story of two guardian angels who help humans in need, without being obvious about the help that they are providing.JohnThe same John mentioned at the beginning of Paula's book.",5,"I'm so glad this was the only ""two volume"" set. a TEN STAR series.",1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,2763,"['one', 'favorite', 'series', 'own', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'will', 'eventually', 'purchase', 'rest', 'Tess', 'Monica', 'Andrew', 'are', 'angels', 'who', 'help', 'people', 'Earth', 'sometimes', 'secretly', 'sometimes', 'letting', 'people', 'know', 'are', 'angels', 'are', 'many', 'excellent', 'guest', 'stars.', 'ARE', 'THERE', 'ANGELS', 'TOUCHING', 'US', '-I', 'know', 'angels', 'work', 'lives', 'Sometimes', 'angels', 'are', 'human', 'friends', 'strangers', 'help', 'when', 'need', 'even', 'knowing', 'Sometimes', 'act', 'angels', 'perhaps', 'angelic', 'nudge', 'mind', 'help', 'strangers', 'Let', 'give', 'two', 'examples', '***', 'get', 'touched', 'angelic', 'urge', '***Years', 'ago', 'was', 'attending', 'convention', 'campground', 'NW', 'Arkansas', 'felt', 'sudden', 'urge', 'leave', 'laptop', 'unlocked', 'room', 'unlocked', 'building', 'go', 'chow', 'route', 'had', 'never', 'used', 'before', 'walking', 'worship', 'center', 'door', 'was', 'farthest', 'side', 'building', 'where', ""'d"", 'been', 'working', 'computer.When', 'get', 'outside', 'partway', 'down', 'empty', 'path', 'buildings', 'come', 'crying', 'tot', 'was', 'lost', 'looking', 'parents', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'where', 'started', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'possibly', 'heard', 'pick', 'up', 'carry', 'immediately', 'chow', 'hall', 'where', 'tell', 'people', 'know', 'parents', 'found', ""'ll"", 'be', 'eating.I', 'know', 'God', 'angel', 'touched', 'day', 'used', 'angel', 'young', 'girl', 'life', '***', 'When', 'someone', 'else', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'come', 'aid', '***In', '2012', 'sister', 'asked', 'proofread', 'book', 'Higher', 'Ground', 'mailed', 'manuscript', 'was', 'few', 'pages', 'realized', 'paperback', 'dictionary', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'reference', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'wrote', 'note', 'asking', 'order', 'Collegiate', 'dictionary.Before', 'could', 'mail', 'letter', 'friend', 'walked', 'up', 'asked', 'had', 'paperback', 'dictionary', 'said', 'did', 'asked', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'trade', 'wanted', 'lighter', 'dictionary', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'heavy', 'said', 'YES', 'what', 'did', 'give', 'Merriam-Webster', 'Collegiate', 'Dictionary', 'Laminated', 'Cover', 'latest', 'eleventh', 'edition', '.My', 'friend', 'had', 'idea', 'needed', 'dictionary', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'knew', 'was', 'proofreading', 'Paula', 'book', 'was', 'twelve', 'hours', 'AFTER', ""'d"", 'written', 'note', 'sister.I', 'believe', 'Henry', 'was', 'touched', 'angel', 'was', 'first', 'person', 'asked', 'when', 'decided', 'wanted', 'trade', 'dictionaries', 'did', 'even', 'swap.By', 'way', 'enjoy', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'highly', 'recommendOn', 'Higher', 'Groundby', 'Paula', 'Hrbacek', 'story', 'two', 'guardian', 'angels', 'who', 'help', 'humans', 'need', 'being', 'obvious', 'help', 'are', 'providing.JohnThe', 'same', 'John', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'Paula', 'book']",N/A
