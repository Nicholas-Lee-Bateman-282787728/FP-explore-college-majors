561256,A2V62ETXCADXU6,B00004Z4VT,"Henry Smiley ""cade's dad""","[10, 12]","Don Henley is one of those artists people either love or hate:  he strikes one as either wise and insightful or smug and arrogant.  In &quot;Live Inside Job,&quot; Henley reminds us that whatever the viewer's opinion of him, he's written an impressive list of songs that spans three decades.  The concert (taken in part from A&amp;E's &quot;Live By Request&quot; broadcast) leans heavily on songs from &quot;Inside Job,&quot; although there is a good sampling from all of Henley's solo albums.  Eagles fans who buy the DVD may be disappointed by the sparsity of Eagles songs, although Henley closes with a ska/reggae version of &quot;Hotel California&quot; that is worth the the price of the DVD alone.  The DVD has a few drawbacks:  at times, the sound mix is bad (Henley's vocals on &quot;Taking You Home&quot; are almost inaudible at first) and there are virtually no extras (a couple videos would have been a nice touch).  Those are minor disadvantages, though, and the concert itself is an enjoyable reminder of how blue-eyed soulful a singer Henley still is.  This is a nice addition to anyone's collection of music DVD's.",4,A Real Treat for Henley Fans,974592000,"11 19, 2000",2000,1128,"['Don', 'Henley', 'one', 'artists', 'people', 'love', 'hate', 'one', 'wise', 'insightful', 'smug', 'arrogant', 'quot', 'Live', 'Inside', 'Job', 'quot', 'Henley', 'viewer', 'opinion', 'written', 'impressive', 'list', 'songs', 'spans', 'three', 'decades', 'concert', 'taken', 'part', 'A', 'amp', 'E', 'quot', 'Live', 'Request', 'quot', 'broadcast', 'heavily', 'songs', 'quot', 'Inside', 'Job', 'quot', 'good', 'sampling', 'Henley', 'solo', 'albums', 'Eagles', 'fans', 'who', 'buy', 'DVD', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'sparsity', 'Eagles', 'songs', 'Henley', 'closes', 'ska/reggae', 'version', 'quot', 'Hotel', 'California', 'quot', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone', 'DVD', 'few', 'drawbacks', 'times', 'sound', 'mix', 'bad', 'Henley', 'vocals', 'quot', 'Taking', 'Home', 'quot', 'are', 'almost', 'inaudible', 'first', 'are', 'virtually', 'extras', 'couple', 'videos', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'touch', 'are', 'minor', 'disadvantages', 'concert', 'enjoyable', 'reminder', 'how', 'blue-eyed', 'soulful', 'singer', 'Henley', 'still', 'nice', 'addition', 'anyone', 'collection', 'music', 'DVD']",Don Henley Live - Inside Job

The man takes his music very seriously and expects to be taken seriously in return. What this serves to produce is a very polished stage performance.As with Eagles performances, &quot;Live: Inside Job&quot; is an extremely good display of top quality musicianship. Henley gives impassioned and nearly flawless renditions of the best of his solo career, some Eagles material (including a twist on the classic &quot;Hotel California&quot;) and some good new material. He is well backed up by an excellent band and choir.This is an excellently produced DVD. None of the material seems out of place, it is visually pleasing but most importantly with anything that Henley does the sound is rich and enveloping. All in all this is a fantastic listening experience for Henley fans but also for anyone who can appreciate good musicianship.",5,This is Henley,1061337600,"08 20, 2003",2003,926,"['Don', 'Henley', ""n't"", 'never', 'will', 'be', 'flamboyant', 'artist', 'DVD', 'only', 'prove', 'man', 'music', 'very', 'seriously', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'return', 'What', 'produce', 'very', 'polished', 'stage', 'performance.As', 'Eagles', 'performances', 'quot', 'Live', 'Inside', 'Job', 'quot', 'extremely', 'good', 'display', 'top', 'quality', 'musicianship', 'Henley', 'impassioned', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'renditions', 'best', 'solo', 'career', 'Eagles', 'material', 'including', 'twist', 'classic', 'quot', 'Hotel', 'California', 'quot', 'good', 'new', 'material', 'well', 'backed', 'up', 'excellent', 'band', 'choir.This', 'excellently', 'produced', 'DVD', 'None', 'material', 'place', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'most', 'importantly', 'anything', 'Henley', 'sound', 'rich', 'enveloping', 'fantastic', 'listening', 'experience', 'Henley', 'fans', 'also', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'good', 'musicianship']",Don Henley Live - Inside Job
561258,A1B9XODPEB1RWX,B00004Z4VT,M on Amazon,"[0, 0]",Henley truly knows how to sing properly and takes care of his voice. He also aims to sing perfectly every time. There are a lot of live recordings of Henley solo and with The Eagles. I have not heard one where he was not hitting it out of the ballpark. The solo album that this DVD's tour was supporting had a lot of good songs. He also performs other solo and Eagles material. Whether it is audio or video I prefer live recordings to capture a true live performance for the attending audience. I do not like staged live shows set up for the sake of making a DVD. This show is good enough in that regard however they did do a fake announcer overdub. I'd have preferred that the band just walk onto the stage without an announcement (which is probably the way they did it that night) rather than have some person pretending to be announcing the show. This did not warrant a penalty in rating but it was worth mentioning. Otherwise enjoy the show. Henley's voice is in tip top shape as usual and the band is tight.,5,Typical flawless performance by Henley.,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,1012,"['Henley', 'truly', 'how', 'sing', 'properly', 'care', 'voice', 'also', 'sing', 'perfectly', 'time', 'are', 'lot', 'live', 'recordings', 'Henley', 'solo', 'Eagles', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'one', 'where', 'was', 'not', 'hitting', 'ballpark', 'solo', 'album', 'DVD', 'tour', 'was', 'supporting', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'songs', 'also', 'other', 'solo', 'Eagles', 'material', 'audio', 'video', 'prefer', 'live', 'recordings', 'capture', 'true', 'live', 'performance', 'attending', 'audience', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'staged', 'live', 'shows', 'set', 'up', 'sake', 'making', 'DVD', 'show', 'good', 'enough', 'regard', 'however', 'did', 'do', 'fake', 'announcer', 'overdub', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'band', 'just', 'walk', 'stage', 'announcement', 'probably', 'way', 'did', 'night', 'rather', 'have', 'person', 'pretending', 'be', 'announcing', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'warrant', 'penalty', 'rating', 'was', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Otherwise', 'show', 'Henley', 'voice', 'tip', 'top', 'shape', 'usual', 'band', 'tight']",Don Henley Live - Inside Job
561259,A31L7EUN9MX4A7,B00004Z4VT,Music lover,"[0, 2]","Frank Zappa, in his humorous social commentary, Henley is not. They are both one of a kind, with Zappa being the better musician. As far as songwriting, well, I'm simply going to say I think Henley has always been an excellent songwriter and was/is even a better one as a solo artist. He may not get the laughs Zappa did with his unique brand of humor, and maybe it's not quite a fair comparison, but the point is that they both took/take their work seriously and each has their own personal and effective way in getting their points across. Were Henley trying to be a Zappa, Kiss, or a myriad of other artists, he wouldn't be himself and he wouldn't get his great songs across. This is a very enjoyable dvd and any Henley fan and new to Henley people will find this very well done and will feel as if they had walked out of the concert hall quite satisfied.

You cannot compare ""hell freezes over"" with ""inside job"" for a number of reasons..

Henley I feel has more passion in his singing surrounded by these guys however in Inside job if you truely want to appreciate the  man, the song writer, the ""passion"" it is a great concert and dvd... great quality as a music experience and not a flashy show but great quality music.. My only dissapointment is the changing of Hotel California. He should have finished a more traditional version but who am I to judge. There are so many classics but as usual coming off this new album ""Taking you home"" will always be a favorite... ""everything is different now"" is a great version and a underated song along with ""My thanksgiving"" Desperado in his last verse makes a difference than the usual, and "" There not here, they're not coming"" is just a fun road song....

Let's face it, Don Henley is not a stage show, but he is a fantastic songwriter.

However, I was disappointed as the show lacked any spark, and his voice is not as good as it once was.  In fact, he seemed to have trouble reaching the high notes on several occasions.This DVD comes with DTS, 5.1 surround sound and 2.0.  Both DTS and 5.1 sound quite tinny and lack substantial bass.
