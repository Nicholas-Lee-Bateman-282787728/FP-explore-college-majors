1521643,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B006X040NY,amerdale876,"[8, 11]","For those who did not know that the Daniel Craig James Bond films have been prequels to the Bond movies we all know and love, this movie will definitely prove that point! Of course, it stands that the entire trilogy (of the new installments) has been a reboot, but by the end of this film, we're placed in the spot that all of us Bond fans know of our favorite spy. I was worried about director Sam Mendes directing this film as he hasn't done any serious action-packed films. Fortunately, my fears were put to rest. This film has got all the action, a wonderful Bond song (provided by Adele), and a really good story that introduces the important Bond characters of the mythology. However, there is one small caveat here. Sometimes it is not good to be a cinephile and someone who's seen a s***load of movies. Because then, you can't help but notice storylines that get recycled. Case in point: this film. Don't get me wrong, the story is good, the dialogue great, the acting superb. BUT ... the overall plot is something we've seen before in the James Bond saga. Anyone recallGoldenEye, which starred Pierce Brosnan as Bond? Remember the villain Alec Trevelyan (played by a pre-""Lord of the Rings"" Sean Bean)? Well, Trevelyan is a fellow 00 agent who fakes his death and spends the film exacting revenge on MI6 for their involvement in his parents' death. Sounds vaguely familiar with this film's antagonist Raoul Silva (a.k.a. Tiago Rodriguez) (Javier Bardem), who exacts revenge on MI6 for ""betraying"" him. I had the same slight problem withPrometheus; a great film but the story is the same overall story structure as the originalAlien (The Director's Cut).On a different note, it's interesting that this film is a prequel and yet, it features Judi Dench as M, which carries over from ""GoldenEye"" (the film she was first inducted in to play M). It's like it went full-circle. So is this a prequel or just a continuation of the saga? Either way, it's an excellent story. Standouts in the film were Ben Whishaw as Q (YES!!!!) and Naomie Harris as Eve (who holds her own with Bond -- wink, wink). Overall, ""Skyfall"" is enjoyable, action-packed, Javier Bardem plays a great villain, and Craig's vulnerability was needed and well done.

1521653,A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB,B006X040NY,"ANT ""azraelart""","[2, 3]","Let me first start off by saying that I'm not old enough to have been around when Bond first hit the bookshelves or the big screen.  Far from it, in fact!  I think Roger Moore was about on his way out when I was first forming memories.  And I wasn't a big fan back in the day, either, not until college when I started collecting the films on VHS.I've been through the Bonds, though, and was there for each of Brosnan's releases on video.  Still not huge on Bond in the theater, though... not even when they rebooted the series with Daniel Craig.  Not after I fell in love with Casnio Royale and decided to become a fan... not when Quantum came out, a movie I very much anticipated...Skyfall: that was the turning point for me.  IMAX the Wednesday night it was released (12:07am Thursday morning) and the next night (12:07am Friday morning) for the regular screen release.  The wait, the anticipation, the past two Craig performances, the build up, the cast, the trailers... I was finally hooked.  And Bond did not disappoint.As one reviewer already said, the first 10 minutes are pretty epic.  They went on to say the rest of the film was take-it-or-leave-it, which I wholly contest, but everyone is entitled to their opinion.  I concur with the first part of that review, though, that the opening up to and including Adele's haunting intro was, by far, the best opening to any James Bond film ever.Why do so many dislike the new Bond, both the man and the films?  I think it is the humanization of a very fictional caricature.  We turned to Bond to provide us with some silliness and fun at the expense of our very real Cold War fears.  Hot wars were still raging across the globe, but never fear, England and America!  James Bond is here to patriotize your day!  This was very necessary... back then.Now, the world is more globalized, and technology that was once amusing and farcical is very real and tactile.  As such, Bond became more human, more 'defictionalized' in a world that is harder to scare anymore by the goofball antics of Odd-Job, Jaws, and Rosa Klebbs.  Instead, real villains that we don't ever see, covert and secret organizations that ""live and operate in the shadows, not on a map"" (to paraphrase a quote from Dame Judi Dench's very wonderful monologue in the courtroom scene).  These are what scare us now; terrorists, random acts of violence, enemies that we cannot compartmentalize and clearly point out.This is the modern movie villain, so Bond has adjusted accordingly to be more modern in order to fight this threat.  Instead of falling into the trap of scaring us with real-life horrors, though, the films have been keeping enough fiction (science fiction, in some cases) to ensure that we don't take Bond 'too seriously,' that there is still enough of the fiction left in him to be entertaining and not shocking.  I think the recent films work beautifully on that level, and the pinnacle thus far, in my opinion, is Skyfall.I think there are enough reviews to give you the plot elements you'll need to get by, along with the special editions included, of which there are plenty.  It's not the best Blu-ray I've ever seen in my entire life as far as bonus content is concerned, but there is more than enough by most standards.  Besides, I don't want to distract myself too much from the content of the film itself.I will say, too, that they added some very fun homages to the 50 years of James Bond, including casting Finney as the gamekeeper.  The car was an awesome touch, too.  Will all Bond fans fall in love with this new breed of MI6 secret agent?  Probably not.  If you're one of the Connery/Moore hardcore fans, yeah, you probably won't dig Craig as much, which you already know from the prior two films.From an objective point of view, though, this is what you can expect:- high-octane action and stunts- lovely femme fatales and sultry scenes- beautiful cinematography of exotic locations- fast-paced plot that keeps moving, with very few pit stops along the way- classic, jovial, dry wit from so many different colorful characters- outstanding performances by the main cast and supporting playersCraig, Dench and Bardem absolutely shine on screen, and surprising performances are turned in as well by newcomers Fiennes, Harris and Whishaw.  The script has been polished to a near perfect shine (one would hope, given the amount of time we waited between films), and the interaction is flawless.  The scenes are lovely and beautifully filmed, and the cinematography creates a palpable environment for the audience.If you enjoy action movies, if you're a Bond fan or not, if you like suspenseful thrillers, then you have to give Skyfall a viewing.  Perhaps you'll fall in love with the legend as much as others have, perhaps you won't.  But by itself, Skyfall stands alone as a work of art lovingly crafted by Mendes.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",5,Bond's Best Yet?,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,4894,"['Let', 'first', 'start', 'off', 'saying', ""'m"", 'not', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'Bond',

It's the perfect film for such a monumental anniversary.Without getting too spoilery, ""Skyfall"" has Bond resurrecting himself after a slam bang pre-credits sequence that finds 007's life up in the air. He reports back to duty when someone has attacked MI6. It seems someone has a top secret list that exposes the identities of agents out in the field, and it's someone who hits close to home with M (the amazing Dame Judi Dench).Like many people my age, my introduction to Bond was Roger Moore. That's who I grew up with at first, but got to see Connery on TV and video. Connery was the best (and I have a soft spot for Pierce Brosnan as well), but it took me a while to warm up to Daniel Craig. 'Casino Royale' was a fine film and 'Quantum Of Solace' was a disaster. 'Skyfall' is Craig's third Bond film, but it's the first where it feels like he is finally a Bond that I can warm up to and put him right alongside the others. It's a movie that breaks the mold with 007, but also retains the classic elements of the franchise. It's also those classic moments that had the audience I saw with applauding the most. One only has to watch M's scene defending herself before the Prime Minister and her department to understand why we still need Bond and his services. The classics never go out of style.I cannot stress enough how amazing the movie looks. Cinematograpger Roger Deakins has created the best looking Bond I have ever seen. If an Oscar isn't coming his way for this, then something is very wrong. In fact, the movie is Oscar-worthy in other areas. The music by Thomas Newman is phenomenal. The original stuff fits right in with the series while giving hints of the classic 007 theme here and there before really blaring it in a classic scene. Adele's theme song is one of the best ever. It's a ready made classic and Shirley Bassey-sounding that plays out over one of the best and more impressive opening credits ever. You also have a stellar cast. Javier Bardem as Silva is one of the most memorable villains in a Bond film in decades, possibly ever. He is unsettling. He goes from humorous to downright creepy in a blink of the eye. Truly a memorable presence. Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Albert Finney are also new to the game. We finally get a new Q as well, in the guide of a young computer geek played by Ben Wishaw. However, this is Judi Dench's turn as THE Bond girl of the film. She has more of a part than ever before and she owns this film. It makes one wish they had used her more in her other 6 007 films. And Daniel Craig. He is finally James Bond in this one. Definitely his best. He makes Bond human and vulnerable like never before.""Skyfall"" explores more about Bond's past than we have ever seen in a 007 movie. It does a good job of new revelations in a new age, but also keeps those classic hallmarks that we have all come to know and love in the series. You can't have Bond without them. ""Skyfall"" is exceptionally directed by Sam Mednes, who delivers not only one of the best Bond films, but one of the best action films I have seen in years. The stunts are magnificent, the action is breathtaking, the cinematography is beautiful, the music is amazing.

When View to A Kill premiered critics blasted the level of violence and even Roger Moore said he thought at least one scene in that movie went too far.

1521762,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B006X040NY,C. Sawin,"[2, 3]","It may be hard to believe, but James Bond was a complete stranger to this household until the week ""Skyfall"" was released. Squeezing viewings of ""Casino Royale,"" ""Quantum of Solace,"" and ""Skyfall"" into one day probably isn't such a bad idea, but it was a pretty interesting experience for someone who was unfamiliar with James Bond films and who had no expectations whatsoever. ""Casino Royale"" is really well-rounded as it provides thrilling action sequences and a superb story that keeps you engrossed while making you feel like you know Daniel Craig's version of James Bond by the time it's over. It was so disappointing ""Quantum of Solace"" wasn't anywhere near the film ""Casino Royale"" was. ""Skyfall"" just really needed to tap into that same sense of greatness ""Casino Royale"" had to keep this franchise as good as its numbers. Judging by its overseas numbers alone (""Skyfall"" made over $321 million before it was even released in the states), it's safe to say ""Skyfall"" more than delivers.One of the keys to a great James Bond film is a memorable villain. That's one of the reasons ""Quantum of Solace"" was so disappointing; you went from Mads Mikkelsen who cried blood and tortured a nude James Bond with a rope in a chair to Mathieu Amalric who had no charisma and just kind of whined about everything. ""Skyfall"" introduces Javier Bardem as Silva, a former agent who worked for M (Judi Dench). Out of the three Daniel Craig Bond films, Javier Bardem is the best and most mesmerizing villain. Silva is like a more flamboyant Hannibal Lecter who always seems to be one step ahead of everyone else. His speech about getting rid of rats on an island and his mannerisms just sells the character so well. ""Mommy was very bad. Hm?""""Skyfall"" explores James Bond getting older and whether he's still fit to be an agent after getting injured on the job. To make matters worse is that M has been forced into retirement and only has a few months left until that goes into effect. MI6 comes under attack while a leak is revealing the names of MI6 agents to the world, which has Bond go after Raoul Silva who has a past with M and has every intention of killing her.By now you've probably already seen it pointed out, but it's really difficult to look past how many similarities ""Skyfall"" has with ""The Dark Knight."" Bardem's performance has more than a few ounces of Heath Ledger's Joker injected into it, Silva plans on being captured and brought into custody, there's a memorable interrogation sequence, Silva disguises himself as a cop, there's a scene that mirrors the ""Nothing in his pockets but knives and lent"" scene in ""The Dark Knight,"" and Bond is an orphan as we see the grave with both parents on it much like Bruce Wayne. Sam Mendes has gone on record as saying ""Skyfall"" was directly influenced by the 2008 film directed by Christopher Nolan, so the homage and similar formula certainly doesn't come out of nowhere.The opening you've come to expect from these films is delayed as we see Bond on a mission with Eve (Naomie Harris) and events unfolding in a way they didn't plan on. However, the film doesn't break the tradition of a high fueled action sequence opening the film as dirt bikes fly into the camera and the entire train sequence is just extraordinary. The opening credits sequence proves to be just as stylish as ever as we see Bond drowning in what seems like himself and shooting his shadow as we drift along the ocean floor. The film is a visual treat, as well. Everything in Shanghai leaps off the screen thanks solely to the setting and the extreme use of multicolored fluorescent lighting. There's the fight in the skyscraper and the boat ride to the casino. The brilliant cinematography is just as thrilling as the seat-clenching action and incredibly captivating story.""Skyfall"" puts things back on track after the many shortcomings ""Quantum of Solace"" left us with. Javier Bardem's exceptional performance and his demanding screen presence more than makes up for the follow-up to ""Casino Royale."" ""Skyfall"" is visually impressive from beginning to end, offers what feels like the closing of one exciting Bond chapter and the opening of another, and features some of the most blood pumping action sequences of the Daniel Craig James Bond films. But as excellent as ""Skyfall"" is it still doesn't surpass ""Casino Royale.""

1521764,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B006X040NY,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[19, 26]","Daniel Craig made an impressive debut as Ian Fleming's super spy James Bond in Casino Royale, but its followup, Quantum of Solace, was a marked drop off which threatened to derail the franchise.  Enter director Sam Mendes (American Beauty), a well honed script (Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan), and a dream cast.  The result is a well acted, emotionally compelling adventure thriller that takes the formula and rips it open to expose Agent 007 as we've never seen before.  It is also one of the best films of the year and certainly one of the very best Bond films.British secret service agent James Bond (Daniel Craig) and fellow operative Eve (Naomie Harris) are in pursuit of a killer who has stolen a hard drive containing the names of all NATO agents imbedded in terrorist groups.  A fateful decision by MI6 boss M (Judi Dench) leads to Bond being put out of commission.  While M is being leveraged into retirement by her supervisor (Ralph Feinnes) and Bond has lost his edge, a mysterious figure (Javier Bardem) from M's past begins a reign of cyber terror and revenge.  As agent 007 struggles with his future and his loyalties to M, he must look to his past to reconcile his biggest challenge.There are obvious comparisons to The Dark Knight Rises with a fallen hero searching for his `mojo'.  Most Bond films operated superficially and featured unusual characters, and with rare exceptions (On Her Majesty's Secret Service and of course the more recent Casino Royale) did we delve into the personal side.  While early incarnations of the super agent showed him nearly invincible, this Bond is a more humanized reinvention without emasculating its hero.  For the first time, Craig's Bond has a sense of humor with puns and quips (a staple of the earlier films).  In fact, much of the dialogue is sharp.By delving into the core relationships, the filmmakers have added layers and twists to a conventional formula.  The main themes center on loyalty, sins of the past, and tradition clashing with the new order.  There are parallels between Bond and M as relics of an age gone by and between Bond and his doppelganger as direct opposites.This is Dench's showcase as M.  Although her allegiance to Bond was a recurring theme in the previous two films with Craig, never before has her character been shown in such depth.  After seven Bond films, her M has gone from background to foreground as a primary plot point, and she does not disappoint.There is a nice buildup to Bardem's entrance whose psychological motives are questionable including his sexuality.  This is not your father's Bond villain.  As Silva, a man with a dark past whose methods are bold and brazen, Bardem instills a decided creepiness and cunning that is refreshing. Think of Bardem's character as the black sheep of a dysfunctional family with M in the maternal role.A strong supporting cast includes Ben Whishaw as the new quartermaster Q, a young computer whiz who represents the new breed of spy, B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe as a stunning beauty who holds the key to her dangerous employer, and Harris in a pivotal role.With splendid global locations (Istanbal, Shanghai, and Scotland), this may be the most beautifully shot Bond film (Roger Deakins) since You Only Live Twice.  Some scenes are visual standouts like a sultry shower rendezvous and a moment of hand-to-hand combat all done in shadows and silhouette.In this age of 24, Jason Bourne, and Homeland, the stakes are much higher in depicting realistic action and techie scenes, and Skyfall holds its own with solid set pieces including a subway bombing and a tense climax with echoes of Straw Dogs.  There are specific references to the Bond canon including the reappearance of a certain iconic car.It is remarkable how current, top directors have been directly influenced or inspired by these movies.  Steven Spielberg did the Indiana Jones movies as homage to Bond films and even cast former Bond, Sean Connery, as Indy's dad!  James Cameron did his take on a super spy with True Lies.  Christopher Nolan filmed an entire sequence in Inception as tribute to Bond.  David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has Bond style, opening credits; (Skyfall has terrific credits and a sultry, throwback theme song by Adele).  Even Quentin Tarantino suggested several years ago that the Bond films needed to get gritty and basic; think the filmmakers took notice?As J.J. Abrams' Star Trek and Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins showed, a classic franchise can be reinvented or updated while reaping enormous dividends.  With the most touching finale to a Bond film, there are big surprises and a distinct familiarity by film's end that sets the series for a grand run.  For Bond purists, this is uncharted territory, but by `shaking' up the mythology, Bond's story has become `stirring'.",4,Bond's Triumphant Return in SKYFALL,1354665600,"12 5,

If you want to see a non-stop action packed movie; with a little humor, then this is the movie to see. In fact, this may very well be the best James Bond movie to date. In Skyfall we finally get a glimple into 007's background which makes the character even more intriguing. Daniel Craig is awesome as James Bond. He brings a sense of humor to the Bond character that makes this action packed movie very entertaining on all levels. Not to be a spoiler, but there is a part in the movie in which Bond must undergo numerous tests to prove that he is fit for duty. The ""psych evaluation"" scene has got to be one of the funniest that I have seen on film. As always, Judy Dench was great as M and the head of MI6, but Ralph Fiennes (Mallory), Ben Whishaw(Q), and Naomie Harris (Moneypenny) are great additions to the James Bond franchise.

1521771,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B006X040NY,DanD,"[36, 49]","Let's face it: after QUANTUM OF SOLACE, we were all kind of hesitant about what kind of film BOND 23 would be.  Even when Sam Mendes, director of the classic AMERICAN BEAUTY, signed on, we were still skeptical.  We all know Daniel Craig brings a certain screen presence to the role; he may not be Sean Connery, but then, Connery's Bond wouldn't necessarily work nowadays.  (Don't get me wrong: love the classic Bond.  Hell, I'm even a Roger Moore fan, don't hold that against me.)  Craig's Bond is a morally flawed creation, a character with a dark heart who (usually) does the right thing for (sometimes) the right reasons.Here's the trick about SKYFALL, what makes this film work so well: it isn't even about Bond.  The film centers around M (Judi Dench), and her dangerous past, which is personified in the rise of a new villain: Silva.  He's a cyberterrorist who could bring about the collapse of civilized society with the push of a button...but instead, he's using his power to bring M to her knees.  Bond is merely a pawn in his scheme: two rats fighting for survival.  Which animal will triumph, and which will be torn to shreds?SKYFALL is a brilliant film.  Plain and simple.  It has its flaws, as do all Bond films (even a Moore film wouldn't have stooped to the level of CGI Komodo dragons...well, maybe).  But its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.  Director Mendes has flat-out stated that, without the success of THE DARK KNIGHT, SKYFALL would not have been possible; this is evident, for what KNIGHT did for superhero films, SKYFALL does for the Bond franchise.  (Purists beware: this is a Bond who wears his heart on his sleeve, and you may not like what you see.)  The script is intelligent; that's a rarity for an action film.  The directing is solid.  The scope is broad: shifting Bond into a new era, while at the same time cementing his legacy.  (Fanboys will get a few delights.)But what this film really comes down to is the caliber of acting.  Craig gives his best Bond to date, but even he's out-shined by the supporting cast.  In her expanded role, Dench is a marvel.  It's been refreshing to see her interacting with Craig; here, their chemistry truly comes alive, as two brilliant actors get to take their roles to new levels.  Ralph Fiennes, as a bureaucrat who sees the 00 program as antiquated, is subtle; his performance slowly builds on itself, as his best usually do.  Ben Whishaw and Albert Finney breathe some fresh blood into things; as far as ""Bond girls,"" we have Naomie Harris, whose character is perhaps the least fleshed-out, and an especially good Berenice Marlohe.  But as we all know, a great Bond film is nothing without a great villain, and Javier Bardem gives us one of the best (in my mind, THE best) the franchise has to offer.  Silva is a menace; he's maniacal and unpredictable, a sociopath bent on a vicious, kamikaze vendetta.  He's truly unhinged, and for good reason; as crazy and manipulative as he gets (his opening scene is a brilliant choreography of psychological manipulation; some viewers have gotten a little antsy, but pay attention and you'll understand), you can't help but sympathize with him.  And that is the core brilliance of SKYFALL: it's an intensely personal film, so much so that viewers get sucked into the story despite the typical Bond locales and damseles in distress.  SKYFALL is a great Bond movie; some have said it's the greatest, but that's really a matter of taste.  What's hard to deny is that, no matter where it ranks in the Bond cannon, SKYFALL is simply a great movie.

1521777,A3QU74B9N0830G,B006X040NY,Dan Thompson,"[574, 677]","Being the year of the 50th anniversary of the beloved super spy, the 23rd Bond installment had a lot to live up to. While Casino Royale was a worthy and thrilling reboot to the franchise, Quantum of Solace fell flat with critics and fans. To make matters more interesting, MGM has had financial woes over the last number of years and needed a hit to reinvigorate the studio. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Skyfall.Not only does the movie qualify as one of the most action-packed and entertaining movies of the year, it ranks on my list as one of the best Bond flicks to date. As has come to be expected, Craig is terrific as the British spy, portraying the character with charm and intensity. The action is top notch and the story is superbly written. Among my favorite moments were the blistering opening sequences, the introduction of the film's villain, and the intense final act, which finds Bond cornered yet unafraid. The real treat, however, is Bardem's role as the sinister Silva. Rivaling any villain in recent memory, save Heath Ledger's Joker, Bardem is intimidating, powerful, and irresistible to watch. You'll find yourself glued to the screen whenever he appears, and hoping he'll show up again soon when he's gone.Another huge nod has to go to Mendes, whose vision of Bond is spectacular. The movie is tightly scripted and the director does a very fine job of bringing out great performances from his cast. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in a film for a long time; the production crew did a remarkable job utilizing light, colors, and atmosphere to really draw the audience in. Another treat is the glimpse the audiences gets into Bond's past, which plays a crucial role in the film.The transfer to Blu-ray is beautiful; the colors are pin-sharp and the picture is clear, crisp, and detailed. In a film that contains such vibrant colors and contrasts, this was immensely important for home release. All of the great cinematographic moments you saw in the theater look just as great here. The audio is equally perfect. The disc's DTS-HD MA 5.1 track contain all the intensity and clarity contained in the theatrical release so you can enjoy the crashes, explosions, gun shots, and dialogue in high definition.By way of special features, there's just under an hour of behind-the-scenes featurettes that are an interesting watch, as well as the original action-heavy trailer for the movie, ""Skyfall Premiere"" feature, and two different audio commentaries; a detailed and information-rich feature from Mendes and a not-so-interesting one from producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and production designer Dennis Gassner. The insight from Mendes is fascinating and any fan of the film will be sure to enjoy it. The commentary from the producers felt more like a promotion of the film and could have been left off the disc in my opinion.Whether your a die-hard Bond fan or a casual observer, Skyfall has something for everyone. There are multiple references to past Bond adventures, yet enough new and innovative ideas to please newcomers to the franchise. I highly recommend this film.

For my money, ""Casino Royale"" is still the best of the reboots.  So many of the scenes in ""Skyfall"" go on just a bit too long that the cumulative effect is a very good film that nevertheless feels draggy.  Director Sam Mendes delves into the psyches of Bond and M through their connection to the villain Silva.  Taking this more character driven route could have been a terrible mistake, but they pull it off nicely and take care not to stint on the action.  The climactic showdown, however, doesn't completely work.  It is satisfying emotionally but is anticlimactic coming on the heels of much more spectacular action set pieces from earlier in the film.

1521799,A1VW4ZBXKEYTZ9,B006X040NY,DaytonaDan,"[0, 0]","Interesting to see so many five star ratings on this one. My guess is that reflects a generational split between those of us who saw all the Bond films from the beginning (less impressed) and those who are late to the party and prefer and more Bourne-like Bond, which Craig has always been. This is a far better offering than the dreadful Quantum of Solace but still fell a bit short in my view.  I will agree it is perhaps the most visually interesting Bond in a while. The Instanbul and Shanghai sequences were particularly beautiful and the opening chase scene was very impressive, even if you HAVE to wonder how even Bond could have survived that fall off the bridge at the end of the chase. The action is all downhill from there and ending was perhaps the least spectacular of any Bond film to date. As some others have noted, the movie does suffer from a lack of sense of humor, which was always a part of the earlier movies. Much too dark. Way too serious.

1521833,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B006X040NY,Douglas King,"[15, 22]","Until Daniel Craig took over the role with ""Casino Royale,"" I was never a big James Bond fan. I enjoyed some of the films, but I never found him to be a very compelling hero. At times, he even seemed like a parody of male fantasy - an infallible, oversexed, entitled alpha male. Craig brought new life into the character, making him a scrappy, visceral hero, and with his piercing gaze revealed a depth to the character I had never seen before.Whether it's a response to the tough times we've living in, or strictly a matter of creative direction, James Bond 2012 is no longer living a male fantasy. Sure, he still has the ability to seduce and bed beautiful women, but aside from that, things have gotten tough. In the beginning of ""Skyfall"", Bond is accidently shot by his own team while on top of a moving train, where he falls hundreds of feet into a body of water. Thought dead, he takes the opportunity to disappear for a while and enjoy the anonymous life. It's only when MI6 is attacked on their own turf and the results are so overwhelming that it makes the international news that Bond decides to reemerge.Upon his return, Bond is no longer in top form. Craig is far from the oldest actor to play the character, but his superiors and co-workers seem to think he's too old to be continuing as a field agent. His injuries have left him with an unsteady trigger finger, and his heavy drinking and pain medication have made him a liability. M (Judi Dench) only clears him to return to action out of a mix of desperation and loyalty. 2012's James Bond is no longer a superhero. He's tough, stoic, and brave, but he's no longer the alpha male - he's the underdog.Bond goes about tracking down the man who both blew up MI6's headquarters and is now revealing the identities of covert field agents (guaranteeing their deaths.) When he does come across Silva (Javier Bardem), that's when things get really interesting. In the case of ""Skyfall"", not only is the hero a much more interesting character, but the villain is fascinating. A disgraced and destroyed former MI6 agent himself, the character seems to want nothing more than to destroy his former boss M by first destroying everything that means anything to her - her reputation, her co-workers, and her country.In the film's final act, Bond takes M to ""Skyfall,"" the Scottish estate where he was born and raised. The most logistically safe place to do final battle with Silva is also Bond's most emotionally dangerous territory - the place where he lost his parents as a boy. It's here that the three damaged, strong central characters - Bond, M, and Silva - have to face themselves and each other.""Skyfall"" is an example of an elevated action film. When I grew up in the 80's, action films were mostly populated by hack actors, with weak storylines and mediocre directing. Skyfall utilizes a talented filmmaker (Sam Mendes, the man behind ""American Beauty""), powerhouse actors (Craig, Bardem, and Judi Dench are all wonderful) a strong script and lush cinematography to prove, once again, that any genre of film can be elevated when the people behind it have the talent and skill required.",5,Resurrection,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,3148,"['Daniel', 'Craig', 'took', 'over', 'role', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'James', 'Bond', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'never', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'compelling', 'hero', 'times', 'even', 'seemed', 'parody', 'male', 'fantasy', 'infallible', 'oversexed', 'entitled', 'alpha', 'male', 'Craig', 'brought', 'new', 'life', 'character', 'making', 'scrappy', 'visceral', 'hero', 'piercing', 'gaze', 'revealed', 'depth', 'character', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'response', 'tough', 'times', ""'ve"", 'living', 'strictly', 'matter', 'creative', 'direction', 'James', 'Bond', '2012', 'longer', 'living', 'male', 'fantasy', 'Sure', 'still', 'ability', 'seduce', 'bed', 'beautiful', 'women', 'aside', 'things', 'have', 'gotten', 'tough', 'beginning', 'Skyfall', 'Bond', 'accidently', 'shot', 'own', 'team', 'top', 'moving', 'train', 'where', 'hundreds', 'feet', 'body', 'water', 'Thought', 'dead', 'opportunity', 'disappear', 'while', 'enjoy', 'anonymous', 'life', 'only', 'when', 'MI6', 'attacked', 'own', 'turf', 'results', 'are', 'so', 'overwhelming', 'international', 'news', 'Bond', 'reemerge.Upon', 'return', 'Bond', 'no', 'longer', 'top', 'form', 'Craig', 'far', 'oldest', 'actor', 'play', 'character', 'superiors', 'co-workers', 'seem', 'think', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'continuing', 'field', 'agent', 'injuries', 'have', 'left', 'unsteady', 'trigger', 'finger', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'pain', 'medication', 'have', 'made', 'liability', 'M', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'only', 'return', 'action', 'mix', 'desperation', 'loyalty', '2012', 'James', 'Bond', 'no', 'longer', 'superhero', 'tough', 'stoic', 'brave', 'no', 'longer', 'alpha', 'male', 'underdog.Bond', 'tracking', 'down', 'man', 'who', 'blew', 'up', 'MI6', 'headquarters', 'now', 'revealing', 'identities', 'covert', 'field', 'agents', 'guaranteeing', 'deaths', 'When', 'come', 'Silva', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'interesting', 'case', 'Skyfall', 'not', 'only', 'hero', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'villain', 'fascinating', 'disgraced', 'destroyed', 'former', 'MI6', 'agent', 'character', 'want', 'nothing', 'more', 'destroy', 'former', 'boss', 'M', 'first', 'destroying', 'everything', 'anything', 'reputation', 'co-workers', 'country.In', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'Bond', 'M', 'Skyfall', 'Scottish', 'estate', 'where', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'most', 'logistically', 'safe', 'place', 'do', 'final', 'battle', 'Silva', 'also', 'Bond', 'most', 'emotionally', 'dangerous', 'territory', 'place', 'where', 'lost', 'parents', 'boy', 'here', 'three', 'damaged', 'strong', 'central', 'characters', 'Bond', 'M', 'Silva', 'have', 'face', 'other', 'Skyfall', 'example', 'elevated', 'action', 'film', 'When', 'grew', 'up', '80', 'action', 'films', 'were', 'mostly', 'populated', 'hack', 'actors', 'weak', 'storylines', 'mediocre', 'directing', 'Skyfall', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'man', 'American', 'Beauty', 'powerhouse', 'actors', 'Craig', 'Bardem', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'are', 'wonderful', 'strong', 'script', 'lush', 'cinematography', 'prove', 'once', 'again', 'genre', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'elevated', 'when', 'people', 'have', 'talent', 'skill', 'required']",Skyfall

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","The Daniel Craig movies have really injected new life into the James Bond franchise, but ""Skyfall"" is possibly one of the best Bond movies EVER.This movie is not just a brilliant Bond movie, or a brilliant spy thriller, but a brilliant movie in general -- beautifully filmed, combining the old-school James Bond formula with a very 21st-century brand of terrorism. But what truly elevates this beautiful movie is Sam Mendes' focus on both Bond and M, and the terrible costs of living their lives.A hard drive containing information on double agents is stolen in Istanbul, and Bond (Daniel Craig) nearly manages to get it back. But he's accidentally shot by Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and presumed dead. He's not dead, obviously -- but he uses this as a chance to retire to a tropical island.But then MI6 is hacked by a cyberterrorist, and their headquarters is blown up. Bond reappears in London to offer his services to his country again, but he's obviously not fit for duty -- physically or psychologically. Despite this, M (Judi Dench) sends him back out to find the cyberterrorists before more agents are killed.The trail leads him to Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former agent who specializes in cyberterrorism.  He blames M for his torture and mutilation, and is determined to destroy her career before killing her. Even capturing Silva isn't enough to stop him, and soon Bond must flee London with M to make a final stand against Silva.If there is a underlying question to ""Skyfall,"" it is this: Does an old-fashioned agent like James Bond belong in a world of cyberterrorism and individual extremism? Well, yes. The nature of conflict, evil and cruelty will never change, only the media through which they are spread. It's expressed in a lovely speech by M, which seems to say, ""So what if it's the age of Bourne and Fast & Furious? Bond is timeless.""But Sam Mendes does sow some seeds of doubt about the ""old guard"" -- M is coming to the end of her tenure, and Bond is beginning to crumble from the physical and mental damage he's taken over the years.Mendes' direction is truly spellbinding. The action is gritty and often brutal, but set against backdrops of breathtaking beauty -- a nighttime apartment lit by glowing jellyfish, Bond drifting on a boat surrounded by luminous paper lanterns, and the creaky polished beauty of Skyfall itself. But he never lets us forget the brutality of the villain's ways, such as when the token Bond girl is brutally shot in the head.The movie also takes the chance to dip into the relationship between M and Bond. They have an untrusting, almost antagonistic relationship, with Bond knowing he cannot truly trust M, but also knowing that she does what must be done. And as he encounters Silva, Bond begins to see the creature he could choose to become, but his essential decency holds him back.Craig and Dench rule this movie, and both of them are blisteringly good -- they give stoic performances with strong emotions roiling under the surface. Craig's performance is particularly brilliant -- this is a Bond aching and riddled with scars, but he still has the strength he needs. He also has some deliciously sensual scenes with Naomie Harris. Shaving never looked so hot.But who can forget Javier Bardem? He also gives a glorious performance as Silva, a flamboyant cyberterrorist who hides his hate under a perpetually laughing face. Only when confronted by the woman he wants to kill does he show his true rage.""Skyfall"" is not just a brilliant James Bond movie, but a brilliant movie -- in action, in writing, in direction and in character. The next Bond movie will have a tough act to follow.",5,How much do you know about fear?,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,3650,"['Daniel', 'Craig', 'movies', 'have', 'really', 'injected', 'new', 'life', 'James', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'Skyfall', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'Bond', 'movies', 'EVER.This', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'brilliant', 'Bond', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'spy', 'thriller', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'general', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'combining', 'old-school', 'James', 'Bond', 'formula', 'very', '21st-century', 'brand', 'terrorism', 'what', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'focus', 'Bond', 'M', 'terrible', 'costs', 'living', 'lives.A', 'hard', 'drive', 'containing', 'information', 'double', 'agents', 'stolen', 'Istanbul', 'Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'nearly', 'get', 'back', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'Eve', 'Moneypenny', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'presumed', 'dead', 'not', 'dead', 'obviously', 'chance', 'retire', 'tropical', 'island.But', 'then', 'MI6', 'hacked', 'cyberterrorist', 'headquarters', 'blown', 'up', 'Bond', 'reappears', 'London', 'offer', 'services', 'country', 'again', 'obviously', 'not', 'fit', 'duty', 'physically', 'psychologically', 'M', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'back', 'find', 'cyberterrorists', 'more', 'agents', 'are', 'killed.The', 'trail', 'Raoul', 'Silva', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'former', 'agent', 'who', 'cyberterrorism', 'M', 'torture', 'mutilation', 'determined', 'destroy', 'career', 'killing', 'Even', 'capturing', 'Silva', ""n't"", 'enough', 'stop', 'soon', 'Bond', 'must', 'flee', 'London', 'M', 'make', 'final', 'stand', 'Silva.If', 'underlying', 'question', 'Skyfall', 'old-fashioned', 'agent', 'James', 'Bond', 'belong', 'world', 'cyberterrorism', 'individual', 'extremism', 'Well', 'yes', 'nature', 'conflict', 'evil', 'cruelty', 'will', 'never', 'change', 'only', 'media', 'are', 'spread', 'expressed', 'lovely', 'speech', 'M', 'say', 'So', 'what', 'age', 'Bourne', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Bond', 'timeless', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'sow', 'seeds', 'doubt', 'old', 'guard', 'M', 'coming', 'end', 'tenure', 'Bond', 'beginning', 'crumble', 'physical', 'mental', 'damage', 'taken', 'years.Mendes', 'direction', 'truly', 'spellbinding', 'action', 'gritty', 'often', 'brutal', 'set', 'backdrops', 'breathtaking', 'beauty', 'nighttime', 'apartment', 'lit', 'glowing', 'jellyfish', 'Bond', 'drifting', 'boat', 'surrounded', 'luminous', 'paper', 'lanterns', 'creaky', 'polished', 'beauty', 'Skyfall', 'never', 'forget', 'brutality', 'villain', 'ways', 'such', 'when', 'token', 'Bond', 'girl', 'brutally', 'shot', 'head.The', 'movie', 'also', 'chance', 'dip', 'relationship', 'M', 'Bond', 'have', 'untrusting', 'almost', 'antagonistic', 'relationship', 'Bond', 'knowing', 'can', 'not', 'truly', 'trust', 'M', 'also', 'knowing', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'Silva', 'Bond', 'see', 'creature', 'could', 'choose', 'become', 'essential', 'decency', 'back.Craig', 'Dench', 'rule', 'movie', 'are', 'blisteringly', 'good', 'give', 'stoic', 'performances', 'strong', 'emotions', 'roiling', 'surface', 'Craig', 'performance', 'particularly', 'brilliant', 'Bond', 'aching', 'riddled', 'scars', 'still', 'strength', 'also', 'deliciously', 'sensual', 'scenes', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'Shaving', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'hot.But', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'also', 'glorious', 'performance', 'Silva', 'flamboyant', 'cyberterrorist', 'who', 'hate', 'perpetually', 'laughing', 'face', 'Only', 'when', 'confronted', 'woman', 'kill', 'show', 'true', 'rage', 'Skyfall', 'not', 'just', 'brilliant', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'action', 'writing', 'direction', 'character', 'next', 'Bond', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'tough', 'act', 'follow']",Skyfall

Of course, Mr. Daniel Craig, makes for probably the best James Bond of the long and respectable list of actors that have portrayed this ageless secret agent 007. The action scenes, like just about most 007 films, are a great visual thrill. Surely not the best of Mr. Daniel Craig Bond films, never the less it has its moments, but gradually they wear off. Javier Bardem makes for an impossibly hard villain to believe, too many moments when the movie simply veers out of the path, making him even more incredible than he is supposed to be. I can understand that it is all a make believe type secret agent versus the world's most evil enemy, but there is just so much the imagination can accept.

1521856,A3V4ZFNKJ21P1M,B006X040NY,Endless Kitchen,"[12, 18]","James Bond (Daniel Craig) is in hot pursuit of a mercenary and terrorist collaborator named Patrice (Ola Rapace) in Turkey. Patrice is incredibly tenacious, violent and resourceful as they chase on foot, in cars, on motorcycles and all over a fast moving train. Bond is aided by a sharp but green field agent named Eve (Naomie Harris) but the mission folds and it appears a pumpkin of intelligence secrets are now in the hands of Patrice's employer, Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem). Bond is still missing in action, and M's (Dame Judi Dench) MI6 is under political pressure from various bureaucrats and members of Parliament like Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) and Clair Dowar MP (Helen McCrory). Bond comes back to England after seeing a massive terrorist strike and his past injuries (possibly age as well) have slowed him down. Mallory seems coldly dismissive of Bond, but, as a former member of the S.A.S., he may not be as out of touch as he appears. Meanwhile, Bond meets the new Quartermaster at MI6 (Ben Whishaw) who provides him with a few possible lifesavers in the field.M manages to get Bond approved for his next mission and he tries to catch Patrice in Shanghai with hopes of finding out the truth of this conspiracy against MI6 and the United Kingdom. In the process, he sees a nearly impossibly gorgeous woman named S&eacute;v&eacute;rine (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe) who is armed and possibly connected with this devious plot. Bond follows a clue to visit a casino in Macau where he meets S&eacute;v&eacute;rine, who works for the devious Mr. Silva and makes a deal with Bond to help him in exchange for a life free from Silva. The two travel to an abandoned island where Silva and his mercenaries live and operate. Bond soon finds that he is captured and in the hands of a dangerous, brilliant and psychotic genius in Silva who has a lust for destruction and revenge. Bond is facing the most dangerous threat yet and his comrades at MI6 are literally under attack and unable to stop this barrage of mayhem.Wow! This is a stunning film. Just in time for celebrating fifty years on the silver screen, James Bond 007 is back with perhaps the very best entry in the series and one heck of a thrilling mixture of action, drama and even tragedy. Bond is in style, vintage yet bold, fresh and finally, Bond has an apposite and relevant place in the 21st century, post-Cold War world. At one point, James Bond calls resurrection his hobby but that could easily be a nod to this film's push in a new direction. Speaking of nods, the film provides very minor but appreciable nods to Bond films of the past fifty years throughout but they are sly and not distracting in the least.This might be the most compelling and complex Bond film yet but the surprises and twists of this superbly entertaining movie are worth keeping secret. Anyone who appreciates Bond, action movies or just well-told stories will have a blast watching Skyfall. Daniel Craig not only makes a great Bond but his talent and commitment as an actor really shines through. He shows the imperfect strength of the character and his emotions underneath the cool, introverted and brooding exterior. The Bond of the novels with a touch of Timothy Dalton is Craig's style as Fleming-esque is the only word to describe him. Javier Bardem, an engaging and talented actor if there ever was one, creates an instant classic villain in Raoul Silva just as he did in No Country for Old Men. He is vicious and twisted, inside and out; a Bond villain with a touch of Hannibal Lector and the Joker. He is eccentrically dressed and groomed with an odd disfigurement and a sick sense of humor. When he makes his incredible and memorable first appearance, he gives a skin-crawling anecdote of how to dispose of rats. Bardem steals the show and his character is so fascinating in each scene he is in despite how cruel and malicious he is. That said, there are elements of tragedy in Silva's background that allows him to be much more sympathetic than most film protagonists' foes, let alone a Bond villain.The rest of the cast delivers as well. Naomie Harris is excellent as Eve, an agent who is out of her league in the field but still a vital ally as well as a love interest. Judi Dench gives her best performance yet in the Bond franchise as M's leadership is vital once British Intelligence is directly targeted. Do spies working in the shadows still bear relevance in 2012? The answer, according to M in a passionate and poetic speech, is yes because enemies like Silva live and operate in the shadows as well. Speaking of MI6, it was great to see more screen time by Tanner (Rory Kinnear) and Q compared to the previous two Bond films. It makes the drama of those scenes much more interesting and it is interesting to see Q as a younger brainchild without a labcoat assisting 007. B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe gives a very strong performance creating a sympathetic feeling towards her character's trapped predicament that a lesser actor might not have done as well as she did. Fiennes is also very charismatic as the government critic of MI6 who might be swayed into believing their relevance in the age of globalization, the internet and mass media. Albert Finney shows up and creates a charming, avuncular and very tough ally for Bond in the second half of the film. Not since William Hurt in A History of Violence has such a fascinating and memorable character come from such a small role.The script by John Logan, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade is sharp, clever and even poignant at times. Despite a lot of intensity, there is a good dose of funny lines but without any grating hokiness. Sam Mendes' direction complements this story perfectly as the story simply flows and reveals itself so very well. Skyfall's tone shifts between the traditional Bond formula of fun to exciting action to compelling drama to, at times, the ferocity of a thriller. At two hours and twenty-three minutes, some might call this film long but the crescendo and excellent pacing makes it actually feel a bit on the short side (as well as it being so much fun). Skyfall will be both familiar to Bond fans and new to them. For those uninitiated or disliking of the Bond films, this might be the one that sways you over, if only to liking this entry.Master of photography and cinematography Roger Deakins creates gorgeous scenery and backgrounds that really puts a special flair to the look of Skyfall, especially to those who see it on IMAX. The scenes in Macau with Dragon Year floats and Chinese lanterns floating around are simply unforgettable. Thomas Newman provides a great score, although it fails to reach the mantle of great Bond scores like On Her Majesty's Secret Service or Dr. No. Adele's theme song is a bit too simplistic for my tastes but I was won over by the power of her vocal performance. It is rather catchy and fits well with Danny Kleinman's awesome titles. This is another area where Skyfall delivers classic Bond at its best. The shifts of shapes and forms are not only dazzling, slick and cool but they deliver neat clues to the themes of the movie.All in all, Skyfall is a platinum Bond movie and a great film, period. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good film and I feel very fortunate to have seen it a bit early. I am very excited by the film's promise of ""James Bond Will Return"" and the producers' promise of having that return within two years. It is 2012 and, still, nobody does it better.",5,Can I give this six stars?

MI6 is coming under heavy scrutiny for losing classified information all while ""M"" and Bond's relationship is stressed throughout the film.Bond finally tracks down the terrorist behind the MI6 attacks to find that it is a former agent assumed dead.  This agent is a cyber terrorist who has immense power and a vendetta against ""M"". He tries to recruit Bond but fails as Bond brings him in only to discover this was his plan all along. The films follows Bond, ""M"", and the terrorist Silva to a gripping and entertaining end.The soundtrack is amazing. I literally can't get enough of Adelle and the Skyfall song.

Launay,"[4, 6]","What ""SkyFall"" offers to its audience is Bond, James Bond, as an espionage agent...not as a cardboard character or a flawlessly dressed superhero. Back in the 1950's and 1960's, that's how Bond was imagined by his creator.  Go back to the books - start with Casino Royale or From Russia with Love - and you will see that Bond is a tough, loyal, hard-edged spy.  Daniel Craig brings this kind of Bond back.  Sean Connery was glamorous, Roger Moore was silly, but Daniel Craig acts, moves, and thinks like a spy.And the villain in ""SkyFall"" was once an important asset of MI6...perhaps a friend of Bond once.  He is the enemy today because he wants revenge. Why? He was cruelly betrayed by Britain and M when it was expedient for him to get captured and tortured.  He was traded for 6 other British agents. See the film ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" to get an idea how governments will and do make these choices at the personal sacrifice of their agents.  When my father was a spy against the Nazis for the French this was a real fear when he operated in enemy territory. Can you really trust your own side, when you live in the shadows?  And so Raoul Silva (Javier Barden) - the new enemy of MI6 - was born by surviving his betrayal. Governments do create their own Frankensteins.Both the flawed psychological, hurt natures of Bond and Silva are explored in this brilliant thriller. As Judi Dench (as M) puts it, orphans make the best spies.Although there are some extraordinary stunts in the film, gone are most of the spy gadgets that helped Bond get out of trouble.  He has to use his brains, not only his courage, to win this showdown.  I love the part when he goes back into time, and drives his ""Goldfinger"" vehicle again.  The gadget that villian Raoul Silva uses, is one we live with everyday - the computer.  For he is an expert in cybercrime.Now we have reached Bond at 50 - Daniel Craig nails it.

His second film was a disappointing out but now in his 3rd appearance as 007 he shows exactly why he is the best Bond since Connery.As it starts out a favored son from M's past has become an amazing hacker and sets out to get revenge on the boss he feels abandoned him. He also sees a sort of love hate relationship with Bond, whom in his insanity he sees as a rival for M's attention and approval. As the villain is able to dominate the modern world of computers, to defeat him Bond decides to go `back in time' no not some horrid sci fi stunt, but pulling the attention away from the modern world with tricks that go beyond techy toys-for example you can trace a person by credit card purchased, but not cash.Judy Dench reprises her role as M, the only actor since the late Bernard Lee  who really gave you a feeling she held Bond's respect and marks the return of Q branch. Modernized the new, younger Q still manages to verbally spar with the dreaded 00 agent. No it doesn't devolve into the horrid gimmicks of the 80's. At the end of their first meeting Q actually comments on this with ""what were you expecting? Exploding fountain pens? We don't do that sort of stuff.""The only clunker for me was at one point when squabbling with Bond, Judy Dench slips just a little and seems less like `M' than her long running comic character ""Jean Partager"" from As Time Goes By. But this passes in a phrase and what follows is magical.Looking at people's pasts and coming out for the 50th anniversary of the first Bond film Skyfall manages to be respectful of the past without surrendering to it, Adel's theme slides easily among the notes of Monty Norman's classic piece and when James opens a garage door to reveal a silver Aston Martin DBV there's an urge to cheer. But that is the beauty of this piece. It isn't gratuitous, these flashes of the past have a definite purpose in the film but at the same time they give a respectful nod to the 50 years of amazing films that came before.In the end Skyfall doesn't just `stand' alone, it is probably one of the best Bond films ever made.",5,one of the best bonds EVER,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,2177,"['When', 'became', 'James', 'Bond', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'reenergized', 'entire', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'disappointing', 'out', 'now', '3rd', 'appearance', '007', 'exactly', 'why', 'best', 'Bond', 'Connery.As', 'out', 'favored', 'son', 'M', 'past', 'become', 'amazing', 'hacker', 'out', 'get', 'revenge', 'boss', 'abandoned', 'also', 'sort', 'love', 'hate', 'relationship', 'Bond', 'whom', 'insanity', 'rival', 'M', 'attention', 'approval', 'villain', 'able', 'dominate', 'modern', 'world', 'computers', 'defeat', 'Bond', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'not', 'horrid', 'sci', 'fi', 'stunt', 'pulling', 'attention', 'away', 'modern', 'world', 'tricks', 'go', 'techy', 'toys-for', 'example', 'can', 'trace', 'person', 'credit', 'card', 'purchased', 'not', 'cash.Judy', 'Dench', 'role', 'M', 'only', 'actor', 'late', 'Bernard', 'Lee', 'who', 'really', 'gave', 'feeling', 'held', 'Bond', 'respect', 'return', 'Q', 'branch', 'Modernized', 'new', 'younger', 'Q', 'still', 'verbally', 'spar', 'dreaded', '00', 'agent', ""n't"", 'devolve', 'horrid', 'gimmicks', '80', 'end', 'first', 'meeting', 'Q', 'actually', 'comments', 'what', 'were', 'expecting', 'Exploding', 'fountain', 'pens', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'sort', 'stuff', 'only', 'clunker', 'was', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'squabbling', 'Bond', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'just', 'little', 'less', 'M', 'long', 'running', 'comic', 'character', 'Jean', 'Partager', 'Time', 'Goes', 'phrase', 'what', 'magical.Looking', 'people', 'pasts', 'coming', 'out', '50th', 'anniversary', 'first', 'Bond', 'film', 'Skyfall', 'be', 'respectful', 'past', 'surrendering', 'Adel', 'theme', 'slides', 'easily', 'notes', 'Monty', 'Norman', 'classic', 'piece', 'when', 'James', 'garage', 'door', 'reveal', 'silver', 'Aston', 'Martin', 'DBV', 'urge', 'cheer', 'beauty', 'piece', ""n't"", 'gratuitous', 'flashes', 'past', 'have', 'definite', 'purpose', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'give', 'respectful', 'nod', '50', 'years', 'amazing', 'films', 'came', 'end', 'Skyfall', ""n't"", 'just', 'stand', 'alone', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'Bond', 'films', 'ever', 'made']",Skyfall

1521903,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,B006X040NY,"Grimmy ""Grimmy""","[11, 16]","Note: I will not say much about the plot here. If you really want to know, it's easy to find out. But I believe you will enjoy the movie more without knowing what will happen, especially what happens leading up to the showdown at Skyfall - you do NOT even want to know in advance WHO IS THERE at Skyfall, trust me, or you will miss some of the emotional punch. So here goes ...My first impression, right after the movie: not enough spectacle.The opening chase was pretty good, but otherwise there's not much in the way of thrills in the middle apart from a couple of brief scuffles (and a poorly-chosen mode of vertical travel). The action is not that interesting, but thankfully it is not shot in the idiotically shaky ""Bourne-camera"" mode. And there is a ridiculous thing involving a, uh, diverted train, which doesn't really add much. The finale is a mixed bag - more complexity would have been nice, but it's interesting because Bond is preposterously outgunned.But a little later it sinks in: this is not the heart of the movie. Yes, surprisingly, it's about heart.This movie is about depth, in more ways than one. It is about creating and experiencing a deeper, emotional connection with the characters, especially Bond. And in this it truly succeeds. You feel for the poor guy, from his opening plunge, through his feelings of betrayal and duty, and to the deep, terrible loss that is embodied in one of the movie's most important characters, Skyfall Lodge - Bond's childhood home. It is a genuinely moving, touching, darker and deeper Bond. When I watch it again, it will be for those moments.Everyone is top-notch - Bond, M, the new Q, and of course Silva, played by Javier Bardem as a strangely sympathetic monster you can't stop watching. His meetings with Bond seem anticlimactic, and their final face-off not too satisfying, but his connection to M is well-played, disturbing and affecting.M has a greater role here, explored in more depth - the hard calls she has to make, her connection (such as it is) with her agents, and her dedication. Her hard-nosedness and her professional and physical vulnerability are nicely juxtaposed. One of the most moving moments is her quoting Tennyson -Though much is taken, much abides; and thoughWe are not now that strength which in old daysMoved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;One equal temper of heroic hearts,Made weak by time and fate, but strong in willTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.- while we see Bond, a broken and betrayed Bond, a seemingly outdated relic, rushing to save her. It is quite a powerful moment, one that you will want to see again.At the end, the movie takes an unexpected turn which ties it into the whole Bond mythology. Although tinged with sadness, fans will rejoice.The title song, which seemed weak and forgettable on first listen (before seeing the movie), turns out to suit the movie quite well along with the brooding visuals of the opening credits. Both take on more meaning and emotional wallop after having viewed the movie, and I find I could watch them again and again:Let the sky fallWhen it crumblesWe will stand tallFace it all togetherThat last line really hits home, in the context of the finale.So - I wish there were more spectacular action. The middle drags a bit. But it is compelling and engaging on an emotional level, giving us a Bond we can feel for and even cheer on.",4,A deeper Bond,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,3397,"['Note', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'plot', 'here', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'easy', 'find', 'out', 'believe', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'more', 'knowing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'especially', 'what', 'leading', 'up', 'showdown', 'Skyfall', 'do', 'NOT', 'even', 'want', 'know', 'advance', 'WHO', 'THERE', 'Skyfall', 'trust', 'will', 'miss', 'emotional', 'punch', 'So', 'here', 'first', 'impression', 'right', 'movie', 'not', 'spectacle.The', 'opening', 'chase', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'otherwise', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'thrills', 'middle', 'apart', 'couple', 'brief', 'scuffles', 'poorly-chosen', 'mode', 'vertical', 'travel', 'action', 'not', 'interesting', 'thankfully', 'not', 'shot', 'idiotically', 'shaky', 'Bourne-camera', 'mode', 'ridiculous', 'thing', 'involving', 'uh', 'diverted', 'train', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'much', 'finale', 'mixed', 'bag', 'more', 'complexity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'interesting', 'Bond', 'preposterously', 'little', 'later', 'not', 'heart', 'movie', 'Yes', 'surprisingly', 'heart.This', 'movie', 'depth', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'creating', 'experiencing', 'deeper', 'emotional', 'connection', 'characters', 'especially', 'Bond', 'truly', 'feel', 'poor', 'guy', 'opening', 'plunge', 'feelings', 'betrayal', 'duty', 'deep', 'terrible', 'loss', 'embodied', 'one', 'movie', 'most', 'important', 'characters', 'Skyfall', 'Lodge', 'Bond', 'childhood', 'home', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'touching', 'darker', 'deeper', 'Bond', 'When', 'watch', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'moments.Everyone', 'top-notch', 'Bond', 'M', 'new', 'Q', 'course', 'Silva', 'played', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'strangely', 'sympathetic', 'monster', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'meetings', 'Bond', 'seem', 'anticlimactic', 'final', 'face-off', 'not', 'too', 'satisfying', 'connection', 'M', 'well-played', 'disturbing', 'affecting.M', 'greater', 'role', 'here', 'explored', 'more', 'depth', 'hard', 'make', 'connection', 'such', 'agents', 'dedication', 'hard-nosedness', 'professional', 'physical', 'vulnerability', 'are', 'nicely', 'juxtaposed', 'One', 'most', 'moving', 'moments', 'quoting', 'Tennyson', '-Though', 'much', 'taken', 'much', 'abides', 'thoughWe', 'are', 'not', 'now', 'strength', 'old', 'daysMoved', 'earth', 'heaven', 'are', 'are', 'One', 'equal', 'temper', 'heroic', 'hearts', 'Made', 'weak', 'time', 'fate', 'strong', 'willTo', 'strive', 'seek', 'find', 'not', 'yield.-', 'see', 'Bond', 'broken', 'betrayed', 'Bond', 'seemingly', 'outdated', 'relic', 'rushing', 'save', 'quite', 'powerful', 'moment', 'one', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'end', 'movie', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'whole', 'Bond', 'mythology', 'tinged', 'sadness', 'fans', 'will', 'rejoice.The', 'title', 'song', 'seemed', 'weak', 'forgettable', 'first', 'listen', 'seeing', 'movie', 'out', 'suit', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'brooding', 'visuals', 'opening', 'credits', 'take', 'more', 'meaning', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'having', 'viewed', 'movie', 'find', 'could', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'Let', 'sky', 'fallWhen', 'crumblesWe', 'will', 'stand', 'tallFace', 'last', 'line', 'really', 'home', 'context', 'finale.So', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'spectacular', 'action', 'middle', 'bit', 'compelling', 'engaging', 'emotional', 'level', 'giving', 'Bond', 'can', 'feel', 'even', 'cheer']",Skyfall

Is Daniel Craig the best Bond ever?As a traditionalist I had argued that Sean Connery has no peer among the half dozen or so actors who have played 007 on the big screen. Skyfall has undercut my argument. Daniel Craig has emerged as a worthy pretender to the crown. Not only that Skyfall itself just may be the best movie in the franchise surpassing evenGoldfinger (50th Anniversary Repackage) [Blu-ray].Skyfall opens with a chase through the streets and environs of Istanbul, first seen inFrom Russia with Love (50th Anniversary Repackage) [Blu-ray]. In a thrilling chase across the top of a moving train, Bond is the victim of friendly fire and plunges headfirst off a railroad bridge into a raging river where his body is swept over a waterfall. Bond is dead. Of course not. Bond is simply enjoying being dead until the London headquarters of MI-6 explode right in front of M's eyes. Bond returns from the dead and after taking a return to duty fitness exam (which he obviously flunks) is sent back into the field and equipped with a new gun and a radio by the new Q, a computer nerd.What follows is vintage Bond. M and Bond chase the mastermind of the London bombing, a former MI6 agent Raoul Silva, fiendishly portrayed by Javier Bardem. Silva has acquired a list of undercover NATO agents around the world and those agents are being eliminated one by one.Ultimately the hunt leads back to London and then to Scotland for the final confrontation. In the Bond world, when its man against machine, the machines do a lot of damage but ultimately lose. Fortunately for Bond, he has a few machine's of his own including his classic ejector seat equipped Aston Martin DB5.Is Skyfall as good as Goldfinger? The production values are much higher, but then again it has been almost 50 years since Auric Goldfinger planned to nuke Fort Knox. The plots have as many holes and improbabilities as ever. But that what makes Bond movies so fun.So in an effort to bring peace to my household, I will say that Skyfall is the best Bond movie ever, but the mighty Scot Sean Connery is still, barely, the greatest Bond.",5,Best Bond Ever?,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,2140,"['debate', 'rages', 'household', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'best', 'Bond', 'ever', 'traditionalist', 'had', 'argued', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'peer', 'half', 'dozen', 'so', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'played', '007', 'big', 'screen', 'Skyfall', 'undercut', 'argument', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'emerged', 'worthy', 'pretender', 'crown', 'Not', 'only', 'Skyfall', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'franchise', 'surpassing', 'evenGoldfinger', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'Repackage', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', '.Skyfall', 'chase', 'streets', 'environs', 'Istanbul', 'first', 'seen', 'inFrom', 'Russia', 'Love', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'Repackage', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'thrilling', 'chase', 'top', 'moving', 'train', 'Bond', 'victim', 'friendly', 'fire', 'plunges', 'headfirst', 'off', 'railroad', 'bridge', 'raging', 'river', 'where', 'body', 'swept', 'waterfall', 'Bond', 'dead', 'course', 'not', 'Bond', 'simply', 'enjoying', 'being', 'dead', 'London', 'headquarters', 'MI-6', 'explode', 'right', 'front', 'M', 'eyes', 'Bond', 'returns', 'dead', 'taking', 'return', 'duty', 'fitness', 'exam', 'obviously', 'flunks', 'sent', 'back', 'field', 'equipped', 'new', 'gun', 'radio', 'new', 'Q', 'computer', 'vintage', 'Bond', 'M', 'Bond', 'chase', 'mastermind', 'London', 'bombing', 'former', 'MI6', 'agent', 'Raoul', 'Silva', 'fiendishly', 'portrayed', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Silva', 'acquired', 'list', 'undercover', 'NATO', 'agents', 'world', 'agents', 'are', 'being', 'eliminated', 'one', 'one.Ultimately', 'hunt', 'back', 'London', 'then', 'Scotland', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Bond', 'world', 'when', 'man', 'machine', 'machines', 'do', 'lot', 'damage', 'ultimately', 'lose', 'Fortunately', 'Bond', 'few', 'machine', 'own', 'including', 'classic', 'ejector', 'seat', 'equipped', 'Aston', 'Martin', 'DB5.Is', 'Skyfall', 'as', 'good', 'Goldfinger', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'much', 'higher', 'then', 'again', 'been', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'Auric', 'Goldfinger', 'planned', 'nuke', 'Fort', 'Knox', 'plots', 'have', 'many', 'holes', 'improbabilities', 'ever', 'what', 'Bond', 'movies', 'so', 'fun.So', 'effort', 'bring', 'peace', 'household', 'will', 'say', 'Skyfall', 'best', 'Bond', 'movie', 'ever', 'mighty', 'Scot', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'still', 'barely', 'greatest', 'Bond']",Skyfall

Since that time, we have only ever missed a couple of Bond movies in the theater.We had gotten to see Casino Royale in the theater, which we both had agreed was pretty good...and we liked Daniel Craig as the new Bond.  We missed Quantum of Solace in the theater however, and while we both agreed that it was good, we didn't like it as well as Casino Royale, and definitely not as well as past Bond movies before it.  Upon seeing Skyfall however, both our faiths were renewed in Bond anew, and in Skyfall we both felt Daniel Craig put forth his best performance as Bond, even more so than Casino Royale we felt, which was pretty dang good itself.Not only were the performances by Daniel Craig, Judy Dench, and the rest of the cast stirring and enjoyable to watch, but the action in this film also shined it's best out of all 3 of the new Bond films.  On top of that, it was good to see Bond's humor and his filanderings with women return...what would Bond be without those things?  Understandably, Casino Royale was the start of a whole new franchise of Bond films, and in his beginning these kinds of appetites did not quite exist...Casino Royale was more serious, as well it should have been, and Daniel Craig shined there, and now once the Bond most know and love has returned in Skyfall, Daniel Craig is no less brilliant.This Bond film apparently is the highest grossing Bond film of all time according to an article I have read, and it doesn't surprise me because it is fantastic!  It is my favorite Bond film since Goldeneye...I felt that was Brosnan's best Bond film, and I really enjoyed the agent pitted against agent concept in that one, which is also probably a little bit of why I liked Skyfall too because in fact Bond is pitted against a rogue agent in this as well...who also, as it were, is completely insane...Javier Bardem plays this maddened rogue agent brilliantly too!If you're a Bond fan or any kind of action/espionage fan at all...you NEED to watch this Bond movie!

In ""Skyfall"" James is scarred (physically and emotionally) and more mature, though a bit world weary, but still able to hold his own in a knock-down, drag-out fight and in the boudoir. Unfortunately, for James and us, the ""Bond Girls"" in this movie don't play any major roles and seem, to me, to be on the fringe of things. You don't get to know them as fully as you did the beautiful, intelligent, and sexy Vesper Lynd from ""Casino Royale"", and really don't care much about them.

But, hey, neither did the un-manly Roger Moore and look how many ridiculous Bond movies he starred in.I will say that the psychopathic bad guy, Raoul Silva, was quite JB's match in this one.

1521930,A319SKSB556033,B006X040NY,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[4, 6]","After the abortion that was Quantum of Solace, Skyfall is the only Bond to retain the same actor after a four year long gap, and is the representation of the 50th anniversary of MGM's flagship franchise. Does Skyfall deliver, or does Adele let it crumble? It has a LOT (and I mean a helluva lot) to make up for, and I feel that critics fawned over it a bit too much, probably just ecstatic that it wasn't Quantum of Soulless. I enjoyed some of Skyfall, but overall I felt deflated and occasionally a bit bored. There's more subtext here than usual, but the plot is full of holes and it weighs down the action too much.After a list of undercover agents is stolen (it is never explained how as the movie jumps in after the story has already started) Bond goes off in pursuit of the culprit and is accidentally gunned down by his colleague during a scrap aboard a train moving over a massive viaduct. M believes him dead and is due to be hauled over the coals for analogue incompetence in a digital age. But Bond knows he lives twice and guesses he'll die another day. He's broken and beaten-down, though he insists he's good enough for another shot at catching the baddie.And so enters Javier Bardem as Silva, a charismatic ex-agent (it's never made clear if he was a double-oh) who lives for revenge. He IS a great villain and is wonderful to watch, bringing an unusual amount of sadness and empathy to the role. He wants to get back at M for selling him out some years previous, and as Bond does everything in his power to protect her they come across as siblings fighting for mother's attention and approval. It gives the film an emotional heart that Bond doesn't usually have.I feel that this is undone by such ludicrous development and bad scripting as Silva goes about executing a years-in-development plan that relies on way too much contrivance. Where on Earth does Silva get his endless supply of goons? Does he put an ad in the paper? Wanted: Henchman for revenge plot. Must be willing to dress the part (no uniform provided) and die for me. Meets national minimum wage. You can have a gun if you want.And, for that matter, where does he get his supplies, equipment, helicopters? For a man living as a ghost he sure is connected. Yes, I know I am pedantically picking apart an action movie plot, but Skyfall promotes itself as more serious and a return to form. The aforementioned complaints feel like leftover elements from the Bronson era, and I do feel like it is high time to fire Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. With this fresh start they should have brought in stronger writers, or perhaps just employ a single writer for consistency.B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe and Naomi Harris pop in as the Bond girls but neither are really given anything to do, the former having about 10 lines of dialogue. And with the franchise adapting to modern sensibilities it feels a bit corny having Bond jump into bed (or in this case shower) with a girl he met five minutes earlier. He's a bit too detached from them for their presence to have any impact on the plot.There are many attempts to give this entry a better continuity with previous movies, and while I really like this, it feels a little (just a little) fanboy-ish. Am I the only one who thinks that the Aston Martin (in all of it's lovely gray-ishness) is an ugly-as-sin automobile? Or that the Walther PPK is a wimpy-as-hell gun? I've seen potato guns that look more intimidating. Also, the film explores Bond's roots and history more so then ever before, but the big revelation about M's past that has been teased in the pre-release hype is thoroughly non-existent. Judi Dench does get a lot more to do this time around and really does become the emotional core of the Oedipal fracas between Bond and Silva.Roger Deakin shoots the entire film in Redcode RAW and it looks L-O-V-E-L-Y. Every scene has its own unique aesthetic and atmospheric production design. Really, really good work there. All done digitally, obviously, and while it's gorgeous for this 50th anniversary adventure, I hope it doesn't become standard practice. 35mm may be the past, but I hope it sticks around for the future.David Arnold is gone. In his place is Thomas Newman, who unfortunately scores the film with no decent melodies and rarely even uses the Bond theme or even the melody from the title song. How I miss John Barry. There is a fare amount of globe-trotting, including Turkey, China, Macau, and the Scottish highlands. However, too much of this cuts back to mundane London. Stuart Baird (having seemingly abandoned his career as a director) cuts it altogether expertly, but he can't add excitement to scenes that have been written so flatly.I've always felt that Bond movies are defined by the second unit and stunt co-ordination. With the action reserved for short bursts in Skyfall it allows Sam Mendes a chance to put his own stamp on the film. This is both good and bad. Turning a Bond in a character study is a bold chance to take, but they should have turned up the action more. I like gritty, realistic stunts and choreography, but Bond isn't really the franchise for it. There is a sweet spot in-between invisible cars and fist-fighting and I am not sure that Skyfall has found it.It's not the darkest or angriest Bond adventure (that honor goes to Licence to Kill), but it sure is most atmospheric and downbeat. Let's hope that next time around they deliver more spectacle and excitement.The Blu-ray looks and sounds flawless in 2.40:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and loads of extras.",4,Where you go I go.

London, Istanbul, Shanghai, Macao, and Scotland of course, the castle of Skyfall. And hurry up about it because Skyfall will be completely destroyed in the operation.You have the stunts, the car hunts, the chases, and all the physical elements necessary in that film. Istanbul is one city splashed with this mission and that's the second time in three months, after Taken 2. But it is hardly really said. You recognize Turkey if you know it.  Shanghai is more in the tradition of Bourne and his films. But no Eastern Europeans, not even Moscow nor Berlin. That is rather clean after all. The main damage is in London and Scotland. They even cut the Eiffel Tower out, but not Big Ben.The British respect their borders and like their country. We are speaking of the MI6 of course but there is a big leak in the system and that leak does not come from outside but from inside, in fact from an agent who was one of the best, if not the best in his 1980-90 time, but he got caught and in the MI6, the famous M, the lady boss of the service, decided to trade him. When someone very faithful survives such a treacherous decision, you can expect difficulties.And difficulties they got. But the main difficulty came from the government and Parliament who started criticizing the work of the service and the security of the country in the name of modern technology that should be used instead of secret agents and shadowy maneuvers. And no one has the courage to bring to light the simple facts. Yet this simple situation of a treacherous agent within the system is the main idea in this film: danger is not from outside but from inside and the solution can only come from inside too.That's why this film is better than most other films in that field. It is not targeting foreign enemies but a national agent that turned bitter, sour, rotten, self-motivated by vengeance.The point is not even to know whether he is going to get his vengeance or not, but how it is going to happen. And that you will have to look for it in the film.

Yes, and that tough call complicates matters for MI6; even James Bond's loyalty is put to the test. However, with world class villains (and his own death) to contend with, there isn't a moment to reflect on her misdeeds.Director Sam Mendes (""Revolutionary Road"") is working for the first time with the Broccoli family, who has owned this Bond franchise for 50 years. There is no doubt Mendes knows exactly what the fans expect, he delivers non-stop action, wonderful reminders of past Bond films, lots of gunfire and fisticuffs, plus oodles of blowie uppie stuff!We recognize the regulars, but watch for some new ones, too:* Daniel Craig (""Defiance"") is back as Bond, resurrected from the dead and furious that M gave the order to shoot him (he was wearing an ear bud). Now he must cope with a damaged body that doesn't do quite what he wants.* Judi Dench (""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") is still M, beleaguered, bedeviled and besieged. Of course, her quips are almost as funny as Bond's.* Ben Whishaw (""Cloud Atlas"") is the callow youth who personifies this generation of technophiles. Yup, to Bond's dismay, this mop-headed geek is our new Q and we love him from the get-go!* Naomie Harris (""Mandala, Long Walk to Freedom"") is Bond's sidekick in the opening scenes in Istanbul. Wait until you hear her last name!* Javier Barden (""Biutiful"") seems to have SUCH fun playing villains; this flaxen-haired bad guy is almost as persistent as our hero; he just doesn't know when to quit! Revenge is a powerful motivator.This popular franchise illustrates what we mean when we say ""sensory overload.""

It's touching at times, but not overwrought with pathos. The opening titles are my favorite in the entire series (although the award for best Bond theme still goes to Shirley Bassey's Goldfinger). Sam Mendes has shot a visually stunning film (probably the most artistically stunning of the entire series in terms of cinematography). Javier Bardem gives us a villian that could easily take his place among the most disturbing villains in cinematic history including the likes of Heath Ledger's Joker and Ted Levine's brilliant Buffalo Bill/Jame Gumb from Silence Of The Lambs. It was as if Bardem was actually channeling the two to create Silva and he owns every single scene that he inhabits throughout the film.Daniel Craig is a great Bond and I look forward to future adventures now that we have the back story in place.

1521981,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B006X040NY,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[10, 14]","James Bond is sure getting up there in age. He's 59 years old since his birth in Ian Fleming's novel Casino Royal along with 50 years since his first film appearance in Dr. No, and his 21 other Bond films have taken a toll on the franchise and character with its ups and down. It might be time for Bond to retire and get his AARP card. I started watching Bond back in 1990 or 1991. I was just 11 or 12 years old when I caught a marathon of Bond films on what I remember being TBS and the first Bond film I saw was Goldfinger. I didn't understand all the sexual references or the adult humor at the time, but I loved the films and character, and they were really entertaining. My favorite Bond is Sean Connery. His first four film go at the character with Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger and Thunderball were just great. That's not to say he was perfect especially with his second and third go at the character. I think George Lazenby is looked over or unappreciated as James Bond. Roger Moore in the beginning did a really good job as James Bond, but quickly started showing his age after the disaster of a Bond film in Moonraker. Moore was followed by Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and now Daniel Craig as James Bond which comes back to the age thing. Through the years with different actors and different tone or takes on the character James Bond has gotten old. Some would say why continue the series the character is outdated with it being a different type of world and films like the Bourne series, Mission Impossible and others maybe it is time to retire the character and series. The funny thing is Skyfall addresses these issues and masterfully does it with poignant and humorous moments that address these issues.I think I'll try and avoid plot details and instead talk about some of the themes of the film like for example intelligence agencies in the modern world. With countries not being a huge direct threat to nation security of nations with most being criminal organizations, militant groups or terrorist organizations intelligence agencies have to adapt and is an issue in this film dealing with MI6. Of course getting old and being in this line of work is another theme. What is a person like Bond going to do if he retires? I mean really is he just going to sit around somewhere leading a boring life. The man has lived an exciting with women, danger and adventure, but not without being majorly scarred from torture, injuries and losing friends and loved ones. M (Judi Dench) also has to face these realities as does the bad guy Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem). The last issue is the abandonment and mommy issue which two of the main characters have. It doesn't sound like a Bond film does it? I'm sure some would say it goes against the Bond reality, but face it time, age and the sins we commit in life eventually catch up to us and it works in Skyfall making it one of the best Bond films. There are a few flaws in the film mainly I think to do with editing for time. I think Sam Mendes and the editors edited out a few things to save on time. I think you'll notice them like when Bond is relaxing on a beach somewhere. I won't give anything away except it's kind of really short and seems to have been edited. Also there's character S&eacute;v&eacute;rine (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Lim Marlohe). The stunningly beautiful character/actress is underused and I think some of her scenes were edited out or shortened. These are just small flaws that I noticed, but nothing that would hurt the film for me or anyone else.All right let me be honest what makes this film go are two actors and one actress in Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Judi Dench, and really the film is about them. Daniel Craig with his performance as James Bond has become my second favorite Bond behind Sean Connery. I know people will point to Quantum of Solace saying how disappointing a film it was, but it wasn't. Was it perfect of course not, but it is not even close to being the worst Bond film. If you want those all you have to do is watch Moonraker, Never Say Never Again, Die Another Day and The World Is Not Enough. Quantum was middle of the pack Bond film and Daniel Craig did a great job. Judi Dench as M in GoldenEye from just being Bond's boss into a real character with obvious flaws and scars and true affection and respect for James and she truly shows it here in Skyfall. Then there is Javier Bardem who truly steals the film as the bad guy. I think this may be the most original villain in the Bond franchise though some might find some parallels with another Bond villain, but I won't tell you since that might give something away. Even with that said Javier does the far better job. He's been betrayed, abandoned, tortured and has been psychologically scarred. He isn't after world domination or something ridiculous like that he's after something more tangible. I might have to watch the Bond films again, but in my opinion Raoul Silva might be the best single Bond villain ever. Ralph Fiennes does a really good job in his role as Gareth Mallory, and I loved Ben Whishaw as the new Q. I look forward to seeing the character in future films. I've already talked about B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Lim Marlohe, so instead I'll talk briefly about Naomie Harris (Eve). She's not horrible nor is she greatly memorable. I ended up with a sort of indifference toward her and her character.The more realistic action they've been putting in Bond films since Daniel Craig began as James Bond again really works. The opening sequence is really good and there's a short sequence at night in a skyscraper in Shanghai that is truly beautifully done. The cinematography was beautiful especially the scenes in Scotland. In the brief scenes they did an astounding job showing off the beauty of the country. Sam Mendes is a masterful job directing Skyfall and beginning together the story and actors almost perfectly. Now to be honest up until about nine months to a year ago I had never heard of Adele, and nor was I a big fan when I heard her music. That being said she did a really good job with the Bond theme song. It is kind of funny and interesting that Bond is the only franchise that does something like this and generally it works. The problem I had with Skyfall's one isn't the song it's the video that went with it. The video just wasn't very good at least to me. Outside of the Adele and the Bond theme the music was well done and worked for the film.Is James Bond getting old or irrelevant? Yes maybe the Ian Fleming character he created in his novels, but not the James Bond you saw in Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. No James Bond has found a way to adapt and cope with the times yet still keep many of the qualities and beliefs that have made him a great character and in doing so he has for now become ageless. Skyfall is one of Bond's best films with a great story, great acting (especially by the three main characters), really good directing and cinematography. I highly recommend this film for Bond fans and action fans in general. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",5,James Bond the Ageless Wonder.,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,7101,"['James', 'Bond', 'sure', 'getting', 'up', 'there', 'age', '59', 'years', 'old', 'birth',

Plus I had four brothers and they liked the bond crap too.  As a young girl, I thought the movies were lame but I loved Sean Connery.  Connery at least made them somewhat watchable.  Let's face it, there wasn't much to watch in the 70's and early 80's. I'd rather watch the Bond movies instead of watching Tom Selleck cavorting around on an island.  (BTW, someone needs to tell Tom Selleck to get rid of that hideous 70's porn mustache and who watches Blue Bloods and why is it still on!?)  I have to say that Roger Moore was the worst bond.  I know he's a nice guy but he was just awful and not believable.  I started getting more interested when Timothy Dalton starred and he was definitely better than Roger Moore.  These movies took a turn for the better when they starred Pierce Brosnan.  I thought he did a great job and I actually started liking these movies.  When I heard that Pierce was no longer playing Bond and replacing him with Craig, I was thrilled because we had just watched him in Defiance and I knew Craig would be taking Bond into the 21st Century with an edge and he's really HOT!!!  Plus my teenage son and daughter also love Daniel Craig.  His first Bond did not disappoint.  As we all know the second was horrible because of the crappy script and storyline.

All the standard elements -- exotic locales, just-barely-possible action sequences, and a super-villain -- are there, handled  more excellently, in cinematic terms, than in any other Bond film I can remember.  And the villain this time (an excellent performance by Javier Bardem) is genuinely scary, and less unbelievably ambitious than most Bond villains:  rather than wanting to take over the world, he has the more modest goal of merely destroying the British intelligence service.  Sex and violence are of course part of the mix, but here they aren't gratuitous or graphic enough to put many people off.  The characters of Bond and M are given more depth than usual by having to face the consequences of their own aging and the unresolved complexities of their relationship.The supporting performances are good-to-excellent, with B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe particularly memorable as a Bond girl who can actually act, giving a compelling performance as a dazzlingly beautiful woman barely suppressing her near-hysterical terror under a mask of sophisticated seductiveness.Many fans will also find it interesting that, though there is a new, genius-level Q, there is less emphasis on razzle-dazzle technical spy gear than usual. Indeed, one motif of the film is Bond's reverting to old fashioned kit like a pocket radio transmitter and a plain old automatic pistol.Technically, the film is of high excellence, and the DVD transfer (I'm speaking of the standard DVD by MGM, I haven't seen the Blu-Ray) awesomely vivid.All in all, I'd say five stars if you're a real Bond fan, three if you aren't, and four for the rest of us.",4,One of the best Bonds,1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,1694,"['Skyfall', 'must', 'count', 'one', 'best', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'standard', 'elements', 'exotic', 'locales', 'just-barely-possible', 'action', 'sequences', 'super-villain', 'are', 'there', 'handled', 'more', 'excellently', 'cinematic', 'terms', 'other', 'Bond', 'film', 'can', 'remember', 'villain', 'time', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'less', 'unbelievably', 'ambitious', 'most', 'Bond', 'villains', 'rather', 'wanting', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'more', 'modest', 'goal', 'merely', 'destroying', 'British', 'intelligence', 'service', 'Sex', 'violence', 'are', 'course', 'part', 'mix', 'here', 'are', ""n't"", 'gratuitous', 'graphic', 'enough', 'put', 'many', 'people', 'characters', 'Bond', 'M', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'depth', 'usual', 'having', 'face', 'consequences', 'own', 'aging', 'unresolved', 'complexities', 'relationship.The', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'good-to-excellent', 'B', 'eacute', 'r', 'eacute', 'nice', 'Marlohe', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'Bond', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'giving', 'compelling', 'performance', 'dazzlingly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'barely', 'suppressing', 'near-hysterical', 'terror', 'mask', 'sophisticated', 'seductiveness.Many', 'fans', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'interesting', 'new', 'genius-level', 'Q', 'less', 'emphasis', 'razzle-dazzle', 'technical', 'spy', 'gear', 'usual', 'Indeed', 'one', 'motif', 'film', 'Bond', 'reverting', 'old', 'fashioned', 'kit', 'pocket', 'radio', 'transmitter', 'plain', 'old', 'automatic', 'pistol.Technically', 'film', 'high', 'excellence', 'DVD', 'transfer', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'standard', 'DVD', 'MGM', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Blu-Ray', 'awesomely', 'vivid.All', ""'d"", 'say', 'five', 'stars', ""'re"", 'real', 'Bond', 'fan', 'three', 'are', ""n't"", 'four', 'rest']",Skyfall

Casino Royale is just a notch higher, but this one is right with it.  This is what they should have done after CR, not QoS.  Anyway, don't take my word for it, this is a AAA title, with all the goodness that a major movie studio puts behind a release like this.  Looks great, sounds great, movie is great.I mainly wanted to write about the digital copy situation.  There is a single code inside here that can be redeemed for multiple digital copies.iTunes: The code will let you redeem for an SD version from the iTunes store.  It requires you to put in the DVD disc from the package, but once that's done copying, go to your iTunes library and delete it (but don't delete from iCloud - this assumes you are using iTunes in the Cloud, if you are not, you can skip all this).  Once you've finished doing that, go to the iTunes store, select movies, and then purchased.  In there, you'll find Skyfall with a cloud download icon (assuming you deleted it from before).  Download it again.  It will also download the iTunes extras with the movie.  That's one of the nice features of iTunes in the Cloud with movies.  It's still SD, but at least we're getting an iTunes digital copy from a studio that probably doesn't want to give you one in the first place.Ultaviolet: While I'm not a fan of UV, I recognize it has some weight behind it studio wise.  The same code will work here, and there's plenty of places you can redeem a UV code.  The card gives you a URL to go to - I suggest ignoring that, and going through the vudu site, as when I redeemed my code there, they gave me an HDX version of the movie, which is their ""ultra High def"" version - a higher bitrate than regular HD.  So that's a bonus.But I can't recommend this movie highly enough, no matter what the digital copy situation is.  There was some confusion about digital copies pre-release, and now that it's actually out (got mine a day early from USPS), I wanted to post something about really is going on with the digital copies.UPDATE: Forgot to mention that the card inside the box says the digital copy redemption code expires on Feb 12, 2015.UPDATE 2: You can redeem the one code inside the box for BOTH an iTunes copy *AND* a UV Digital Copy.

So I figured, why not do a review?Casino Royale revamped my faith in James Bond. Die another Day was ok, but Pierce Brosnan was losing his step a bit. Alas, a man by the name of Daniel Craig took the reigns and ever since 2006, he has fit the suit and persona quite well.Skyfall stars Daniel Craig as Mr.007 himself, Judi Dench reprising her role as M, and Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner. We also have a strong cast of newcomers that include: Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory, Naomie Harris as Eve, Berenice Marhole as the beautiful Severine, and finally Javeer Bardem as the villian Silva. The cast was great; Javeer Bardeem was very convincing in his role.The Story line is what you would expect from a GOOD Bond movie. Although the film itself deals with issues such as Bond losing his focus and having to regain his composure and mentality to become Bond again, there is a lot of suspense, really nice action, and oh yes, very BEAUTIFUL women.So overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Skyfall from start to finish. I really enjoyed the opening sequence where Adele sings her song for the film appropriately titled: Skyfall. Great cast, good story, a lot of action, and more importantly, Skyfall is James Bond as he is meant to be. Sam Mendes did a marvelous job directing this movie.I do want to mention that I have been hearing rumors that once Daniel Craig's contract is up, that it is possible that Idris Elba(fantastic actor by the way) will be taking the reigns as the new 007. Even if that does happen, I have a strong feeling that Daniel Craig will continue to take James Bond in the right direction, and furthermore, we can expect even better things to come in the forseeable future.9.5/10",5,Skyfall Shines,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,1772,"['saw', 'movie', 'theaters', 'owning', 'dvd', 'have', 'seen', '3', 'times', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'do', 'review', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'revamped', 'faith', 'James', 'Bond', 'Die', 'Day', 'was', 'ok', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'was', 'losing', 'step', 'bit', 'Alas', 'man', 'name', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'took', 'reigns', 'ever', '2006', 'fit', 'suit', 'persona', 'quite', 'well.Skyfall', 'stars', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Mr.007', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'reprising', 'role', 'M', 'Rory', 'Kinnear', 'Bill', 'Tanner', 'also', 'have', 'strong', 'cast', 'newcomers', 'include', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Gareth', 'Mallory', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'Eve', 'Berenice', 'Marhole', 'beautiful', 'Severine', 'finally', 'Javeer', 'Bardem', 'villian', 'Silva', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'Javeer', 'Bardeem', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'role.The', 'Story', 'line', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'GOOD', 'Bond', 'movie', 'film', 'issues', 'such', 'Bond', 'losing', 'focus', 'having', 'regain', 'composure', 'mentality', 'become', 'Bond', 'again', 'lot', 'suspense', 'really', 'nice', 'action', 'oh', 'yes', 'very', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'women.So', 'overall', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Skyfall', 'start', 'finish', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'Adele', 'song', 'film', 'appropriately', 'titled', 'Skyfall', 'Great', 'cast', 'good', 'story', 'lot', 'action', 'more', 'importantly', 'Skyfall', 'James', 'Bond', 'meant', 'be', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'did', 'marvelous', 'job', 'directing', 'movie.I', 'do', 'want', 'mention', 'have', 'been', 'hearing', 'rumors', 'once', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'contract', 'up', 'possible', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'taking', 'reigns', 'new', '007', 'Even', 'happen', 'have', 'strong', 'feeling', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'will', 'continue', 'take', 'James', 'Bond', 'right', 'direction', 'furthermore', 'can', 'expect', 'even', 'better', 'things', 'come', 'forseeable', 'future.9.5/10']",Skyfall

Along the way, he provides valuable insights into his directing strategies, particularly in staging difficult moments like the film's emotional climax.Commentary with Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and Production Designer Dennis Gassner: This is something of a mix of the old and new guard, as Gassner only joined the franchise with Quantum of Solace, whereas Broccoli and Wilson are the second-generation keepers of the tradition. Gassner is by far the most voluble of the participants, but overall this is a more relaxed and less dense commentary track, with brief but frequent pauses. Much of the running time is spent simply admiring what's on screen, although the participants do slip in some interesting stories along the way.Shooting Bond (1080p; 1.78:1; 59:24): Whether viewed as a single documentary or as individual featurettes, this comprehensive overview of the production of Skyfall demonstrates what can be accomplished when a documentary crew follows a production from the beginning and then edits together the best material. Here you'll find input from most of the major department heads (with the notable absence of editor Stuart Baird), as well as the principal cast, the writers, the producers and director Mendes.

Daniel Craig is a good actor and the rest of the cast was fine.  I saw the writing on the wall for a cast change from the beginning.  Do not know if it was the producers or writers, but come on, what happened to a good plot or story, what happened to a bit of humor or sense of fun like the old Bond movies?  Doesn't anyone have some imagination to come up with something new?If you like a fast pace, lots of special effects, bodies everywhere, and everything crashing or blowing up, then you will probably like Sky Fall; but if you like a plot, some character development, or a bit of humor, then this is probably not your movie.  In the future, I will have to wait until the next Bond movie is old enough to be shown on TV to decide if I want to even own a copy.  Older Bond movies my husband and I watched many times, especially Sean Connery, because they were fun to watch.  I will probably never watch Sky Fall again.  Over all, it was a dark, grim and depressing movie.  I was bored with all the fast action before the first chase scene was over.  You are left to piece what story line there is as you go.

Bond is much different now than he once was, but at the same time he is much like how he was when he first began. While the tone of this story wasn't quite as action filled as some of the other entries it undeniably has the best cinematography of any other movie in the historical franchise.The production and set designs were outstanding and even the wardrobe, particularly that of James Bond's (provided by Tom Ford) helped make the movie visual gold. The plot was fantastic in the way that it was unassuming and respected the intelligence of the audience. Because of this we were led to some more surprising events in the film. Traveling the world is a tradition in James Bond, but you have never seen it like this before. The locales were so exquisitely showcased it simply gave you an undeniable desire to make the journey to places like Shanghai and Macau.I think the final showdown is one of the best ever. Overall if you are looking for a run and gun James Bond action flick, maybe try one of the Pierce Brosnan pictures, but for the first time in a long time I felt like I was watching art in a James Bond movie in a case of both style and substance.",5,The Evolution of James Bond,1380240000,"09 27, 2013",2013,1243,"['Skyfall', 'marked', '50th', 'anniversary', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'typo', 'Bond', 'much', 'different', 'now', 'once', 'was', 'same', 'time', 'much', 'how', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'began', 'tone', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'action', 'filled', 'other', 'entries', 'undeniably', 'best', 'cinematography', 'other', 'movie', 'historical', 'franchise.The', 'production', 'set', 'designs', 'were', 'outstanding', 'even', 'wardrobe', 'particularly', 'James', 'Bond', 'provided', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'helped', 'make', 'movie', 'visual', 'gold', 'plot', 'was', 'fantastic', 'way', 'was', 'unassuming', 'respected', 'intelligence', 'audience', 'were', 'led', 'more', 'surprising', 'events', 'film', 'Traveling', 'world', 'tradition', 'James', 'Bond', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'locales', 'were', 'so', 'exquisitely', 'showcased', 'simply', 'gave', 'undeniable', 'desire', 'make', 'journey', 'places', 'Shanghai', 'Macau.I', 'think', 'final', 'showdown', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'Overall', 'are', 'looking', 'run', 'gun', 'James', 'Bond', 'action', 'flick', 'maybe', 'try', 'one', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'pictures', 'first', 'time', 'long', 'time', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'art', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'case', 'style', 'substance']",Skyfall

Until now that is.  (Yes, even the ones with George Lazenby and Timothy Dalton.)However, I had tried to watch this movie three times now (free to Prime members) and have fallen asleep each time.  I could not believe that a James Bond movie actually put me to sleep!  I was a little worried that I had actually (gasp!) gotten old or something.  However, I have managed to make it through several other movies and back to back episodes of television shows without doing so.  Which made me wonder just what it was about this one that failed to grab my attention.On the surface, one thing that may have been to blame was the lack of cool gadgetry from Q branch.  Or so I thought.  I mean, how can BOND not have a laser come out of his watch?  Or a car that doubles as a submarine?  But, no.  That wasn't it.Being a very hetero male, the bond girls have always held a special place in my... heart.  I mean who didn't hope there wasn't something in the cards for them (Jane Seymour), or wish for a little Christmas cheer any time of year (Denise Richards) and etcetera?  But, no, B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe and Naomie Harris... ah... upheld the tradition of the Bond girl with very little effort.I even thought that perhaps it was Daniel Craig as 007 for a few moments.  But, the truth is, I was one of the first to applaud his portrayal in the remake of &#34;Casino Royale&#34; and enjoyed him in &#34;Quantum of Solace&#34;.  Perhaps not quite to the point of &#34;Sean who?&#34; but, I did think he did a very good job in both of those.Then I turned my attention to the fact that Bond was definitely slowing down and showing his age.  Yet, other movies involving aging hero's have tickled my fancy as I, myself, struggle with the fact that I just can't do the things I used to.  Or at least as well.  Or for as long.  So, that wasn't it either.In the end, I can not point to any one thing that caused the movie to fall flat for me.

The thief was Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), also an ex-MI6 agent, gets access to the internal server network of MI6 and tries to destroy the entire organization and kill its chief, `M' as a vengeance to an old treachery of M when he was in service. James Bond traces down Raoul in Shanghai (China) and captures him. But Raoul escapes from MI6 prison in London, by hacking into their security systems, and also attempts to kill M, in her office. Sensing danger, James escorts M to his childhood farm house ""The Skyfall"" in Scotland, deliberately leaving a trail, for Raoul to follow, so that he can kill him there. Raoul attacks Skyfall as per Bond's plan, but Bond will not be able to save M, in the battle with Raoul, though he kills the later.The special effects, screenplay and cinematography employed in the movie are simply superb and absolutely extravagant. They are said to have used the latest technology in capturing the moments with Arri Alexa cameras. One can see how money is spent on some scenes that are mind blowing. Particularly the chase on the train, chase in the underground London tunnel, chase on the rooftops in Istanbul, Shanghai and Macau exotic locations and the splendor of Scotland's countryside where Skyfall is located are worth watching and a real value for money. .

Sadly, however, we are treated to the obligatory opening chase through a Turkish Bazaar and then a sequence ala Runaway Train which ends in Bond being shot by his own side then rescued  by a beautiful beachcomber after he goes over a waterfall. Naturally he chooses to remain with her, nursing his wounds mental and emotional, for a time. And despite Mi6's later claims that he is washed up physically, he still manages to perform the horizontal mambo, vertically, no less, while a piece of depleted uranium is embedded in his perfect pecs. I don't know about you, but I'd at least have a headache.After an attack on London headquarters, he returns only to be seconded to Shanghai on the trail of an assassin, leading him to Mastermind Cyberterrorist Silva [ Bardem]. Silva has vowed revenge on his former boss, M, [ Dench] for turning him over to the Chinese, who tortured him. In no time at all, Bond hooks up with Silva's fascinating mistress, Severine, who unfortunately has all of ten minutes of screen time.With a cast that includes Fiennes and Finney to boot, you'd think it would be an all around success, however Bardem's villain is so campy that the gorgeous Severine's twitchy terror of him seems unwarranted. Sure, he'll kill you for nothing, but, meh, he's just not scary.Silva is coming after M, his surrogate Mommy Dearest, and has concocted an elaborate plot to get himself within striking distance, but not before Bond can whisk her away to Skyfall [the most hideous family seat in the entire UK] in his adorable Aston Martin. There they are met by crusty game keeper Albert Finney who has eyes for M and sure can shoot a sawed off shotgun. The biggest tragedy of the entire film  for me was when that lovely car was exploded to bits.In any case, the art direction is just gorgeous and the best part of the film --from the opening credits to the marvelous fight scene in a Shanghai skyscraper against a backlit projection of a giant jellyfish.Mindless and fun.

I feel guilty for missing out on the history when I watch them.Skyfall definitely has old-fashioned pacing.  After the dynamic train sequence at the beginning of the film, it's a slow burn to the explosive finale.  Oh, there are some little action sequences here and there, but director Sam Mendes keeps it simple until its time to break lose and let Bond, Silva (Javier Bardem), and M (Judi Dench) have it out.I am enamored of the lighting and color in Skyfall.  There are several terrific uses of silhouette, but none better than when Bond grapples with a hitman in a skyscraper with an open window.  It's blue and beautiful and has lingered in my mind.  So many action films are utterly forgettable and interchangeable, so I'd love Skyfall for that sequence alone.But Skyfall isn't overly arty.  It delivers everything a Bond film promises, what everyone expects whether they've seen a Bond movie before or not.  Chases, a cool car, beautiful women, inventive attempts at murder.  It's frequently funny, even the ruthless M providing plenty of humor.  There is some musing over whether the ends justify the means, but the heroes of the movie are still unquestionably the heroes.Some elements of the story are weak.  One part of Silva's plan relies on Q, the genius of M1-6, to do something rather dumb.  Of course he does it.  But the characters aren't repeatedly stupid, so I can forgive a few missteps made for the sake of pushing the plot forward.I really should watch the other Bond films, given how much I've enjoyed Craig's outings as the famous spy.

1522102,AII22HNNZEI93,B006X040NY,LynnJynh9315,"[0, 0]","It would seem that betrayal is a hallmark of the MI6 family&#8212;a bitter wound shared by all who take up the mantle of responsibility, regardless of which side of the knife they stand on: betrayer or betrayee. MI6 director M stands on the former side&#8230; or so it would seem, when MI6 headquarters is reduced to rubble by a terrorist bomb and the mysterious man responsible claims that it is a reckoning for all of M&#8217;s sins. Someone she has wronged has returned for blood and he won&#8217;t be satisfied until she suffers the destruction of all that she holds dear.The list of suspects is not short.Notice that I can lay out the entire premise of Skyfall without even mentioning James Bond&#8230; our favorite double-O agent has been enjoying death after falling in the line of fire on an assassination that M ordered. He has taken the opportunity to escape from the life that Vesper and Mathers claimed would consume his soul and leave him hollow inside. Unfortunately his exit was too late to save him: for now any remnant of his humanity is completely gone.At some point in this movie a villain hands our &#8220;hero&#8221; a gun and orders him to shoot a shot glass off of a woman&#8217;s head. James Bond misses on purpose&#8230; but the other man does not&#8212;he shoots the woman dead in cold blood and the glass rolls from her head and crashes to the cement. Bond&#8217;s reply? &#8220;A waste of good scotch.&#8221;Jarviar Bardem&#8217;s character may be the main villain of this film, but I am afraid James Bond isn&#8217;t much more sympathetic: he is a cold, heartless man without even the slightest shred of respect for human life. In Quantum of Solace he ruthlessly murdered criminals and villains&#8230; but now the collateral damage has spread to civilians&#8230; and it is they that pay for his indifference.Some viewers have claimed that Skyfall is a return to form for the James Bond franchise&#8212;I agree with this assessment, but do not consider it a welcome return. The romantic fallacy of the franchise has returned with a vengeance&#8230; the James Bond we remember, capable of blowing up buildings without breaking a sweat and still claiming afterward that he is a &#8220;secret&#8221; agent. Skyfall is rife with similar absurdities and asks us to swallow it all without question while we are inundated with one action set-piece after another. Despite my misgivings, I am plenty capable of enjoying a dumb action film, but unfortunately the set-pieces here fail to thrill: the footrace across a train is too short, a standard fistfight isn&#8217;t made better by throwing it in a lizard pit, and although the ending explosions set an atmospheric tone they are never truly exciting. Even so, I will give Skyfall&#8217;s action one accolade: the duel with the sniper in the glass skyscraper is brilliantly envisioned and executed from beginning to end&#8212;it is easily the highlight of the entire film, but is simply not enough to save it.Skyfall is, primarily, style over substance&#8230; even while it occasionally fumbles to be something more. The reason I did not mention James Bond until my third paragraph is because his character has no place in this narrative. There is an attempt made to bring him into the narrative by exploring his past, but this plot point is not only feeble but actually contradicts everything we have learned about Daniel Craig&#8217;s character thus far. Casino Royale has told us that James Bond was a penniless orphan who went through Oxford on the good graces of a benefactor, but Skyfall would have us believe that Bond is a Scottish heir complete with a rustic mansion (notice &#8220;rustic&#8221; describes the rural locale). Even if we were to dismiss this incongruity, Craig&#8217;s character still feels like a stranger in the place and I could never truly believe that he grew up in the house&#8230; he feels even more alien in the mansion than M does. Unfortunately, Bond feels completely out of place in this film: one could easily write his character out of Skyfall and the movie would not only survive, but I have my suspicions that his absence would improve the film.You might then suspect that this story belongs to M and villain Rhaol Silva, but unfotunately Javiar Bardem and Judi Dench have zero chemistry. Bardem claims he and M once worked together just as M and Bond do&#8230; but Dench and Bardem&#8217;s interactions are too hollow for me to believe they ever even knew one another. The sad part is that all of these failings seem to belong to the writing: I know Javiar Bardem is a great actor, and even in this film his performance is spellbinding&#8230; but that does not change the fact that his character is paper-thin. Bardem does well with what he is given&#8212;but there is no real depth to his role. He used to work for M, he was compromised and captured by the enemy, and M hung him out to dry&#8230; that is all we ever learn about him. He is identical to Sean Bean&#8216;s 006 from Goldeneye, but with less detail and shallower motivations. When a spy is compromised his government denies any knowledge of his existence&#8230; it is practically part of the job description, so Bardem&#8217;s vendetta is without justification&#8212;he knew what he was getting into when he took the job.Judi Dench&#8217;s last performance as M is wonderfully compelling&#8230; but also poorly written. This story is about her betrayal of Bardem, but M has not even a shred of regret for abandoning him to his fate and her impassiveness is a major shortcoming. I shall be blunt: she comes off as a cold-hearted bitch&#8230; and this could have, and should have been avoided at all costs. A better writer would have taken this opportunity to explore her character, her motivations, her dedication to her duty&#8212;that her attitude toward her duty allows no room for regret&#8212;but instead Skyfall only seems to alienate her character further and cloud her motivations in thicker shrouds of mystery.Skyfall is a travesty of characterization&#8230; the film is loud and stylish but it completely and utterly fails in telling a fulfilling story with rounded characters. I enjoyed the action and even the dialogue at times, but it fails at all of the things that Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace did so well, while still lacking the appeal of the older entries in the franchise&#8212;the set-pieces lack staying power and the gadgets are still missing-in-action. In most action films, at least the action is capable of saving it from poor writing&#8230; but that is unfortunately not the case here.In the end, Skyfall is a far better film in concept than in reality and the facets that bring its downfall could have easily been prevented. The setup has potential, the actors are more than capable, and the relationships between the characters could have made for an interesting dynamic&#8230; if only the film had a better hand guiding the plot it could have been truly special. Unfortunately the one thing that Skyfall doesn&#8217;t have going for it is good direction.",3,An unwelcome return to form,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,7063,"['would', 'seem', 'betrayal', 'hallmark',

But with all the big critical reviews, I thought i would give this one a shot. I am glad I did. This one grabbed me from the opening sequence with Bond on a high speed chase on motorcyles, that included going across the roofs of buildings and culminating in his apparent death.As the film progresses, someone has cracked Interpol's computers and gotten a list of every agent working undercover throughout the world. The perpetrator starts posting the list on the Internet putting the agents at risk. He also seems to have it in for M. Meanwhile, M is told to take an involuntary retirement for the mess that has been created.Bond is then resurrected (never explained exactly how) and it is up to him to help M find who has done the evil deeds. The evildoer this time is played by Javier Bardeem who is one of the most psycho villiains to be seen in a Bond flick. Bardeem is a former agent who was once sold out by M (note: at the beginning of the film Bond is also sold out by her but he holds no grudge). He will always be one step ahead of the good guys. Bond is going through a crisis himself as he is no longer a youngster and many of his skills are not as sharp as they once were.In this film we will learn a little about Bond's childhood and what had made him such a good agent.

If anything, this latest installment in Bond's new evolution takes the high art of murder to a beautiful new level.  The theme throughout is light and shadow, and the director makes excellent use of both to illustrate how death isn't dealt only in the shadows.The other theme is old dogs in a world full of Internet-savvy young pups.  Whether it's M (Judi Dench) or Bond (Daniel Craig) himself, they recognize themselves as relics of a bygone era in which satellites and video cameras do most of the spy work for them.  And yet that's what makes Bond so important in this modern age -- he goes ""off the grid,"" where the real terror lurks.Javier Bardem plays an embodiment of that terror, Raoul Silva, a brutally warped villain who has an understandable (if unreasonable) motive to kill M. Just as Bond has an unspoken duty to Queen and Country, the new world tests that loyalty by robbing first Bond -- then M, then the entire organization -- of its identity.  When politicians drag their doings into the light of day, the franchise feels invigorated because it's finally facing up to the ludicrous issues of the past.  Bond can no longer casually sip a martini without being reminded that he's drinking taxpayer's money.And that's a good thing.

The film opens in Instanbul, Turkey, where James Bond (Daniel Craig) has been dispatched to retrieve an errant harddrive containing the identities of all undercover NATO agents embedded in terrorist cells. He fails to do so after a lengthy action sequence in which he pursues a mercenary by the name of Patrice (Ola Rapace). Bond is forced to retire from the Service by a near death experience at the hands of a novice field agent (Naomi Harris) and takes to drinking and popping pills in exotic locales...until the villain behind the harddrive theft blows up MI6's London headquarters and gets free reign of its computer system. A broken Bond springs back into action.Where did this harddrive with the identities of undercover agents come from? Why would such a thing be circulating? And how could anyone decrypt it? Who knows? M (Judi Dench), head of the British Secret Service, is asked to resign over this blunder, but she refuses to leave. And she refuses to recall the agents who have been compromised. Now, at this point, one would expect her to be removed from MI6 at gunpoint and perhaps escorted to the nearest lockup. But M must remain, regardless of gross incompetence and questionable mental health, because the villain, a former MI6 agent calling himself Silva (Javier Bardem), was driven mad by torture and plans to carry out a personal vendetta against M, whom he holds responsible for his own twisted fate. He will do this by hacking MI6's secure computer system, which is apparently not a mainframe.At this point, in walks James Bond, an old, alcoholic, drug-addled, and very neurotic misanthrope in a state of perpetual misery. But Bond has a sentimental attachment to M, who sends him into the field, even though he is mentally unstable, failed every physical and psychiatric test that MI6 could devise, and appears to be suffering from the DTs. ""Skyfall""'s writers seem to have taken a page from ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Our superhero is all of a sudden a mental and physical basketcase, but he will inexplicably regain his prowess -and his cartilage- when the time comes to fight the bad guy. Silva looks like Julian Assange doing The Joker, so that wasn't the only Batman movie the writers saw. He's a silver-haired computer hacker and insane agent of chaos who wreaks havoc by posting sensitive information on YouTube. This is supposed to embody contemporary fears?The plot is so ridiculous that it's unwatchable. Explaining how bad it is won't spoil anything. There's nothing to spoil. The conclusions are forgone. The audience will only be surprised at how clumsily the plot points are resolved, when they are resolved at all. It's as if the writers went out of their way to make every scene unbelievable. ""Skyfall""'s themes are even less coherent. There is a confused message about transparency. MI6 fears Silva's forced transparency, but there is a lot of rhetoric about whether the agency can or cannot continue to work ""in the shadows."" MI6 needs transparency, or it doesn't. M fears that the new enemies of the civilized world cannot be identified, but she knew Silva well. He's not mysterious. He's a loon with an axe to grind. It's not clear what the enemy is here, speaking figuratively. Is the enemy transparency, chaos, or the mentally ill?Nostalgia is another major theme, though it's similarly unclear what is being said about it. There is nostalgia for Bond's childhood, for his old Astin Martin, for homemade explosives, for antique shotguns, for gamekeepers, for straight razors, for loyalty, for clarity, for ""the old ways."" M is accused of nostalgia for the Cold War. But MI6 concedes that it cannot fight Silva, who is just one mischievous hacker, on his own ground. The old spy agency can't compete in the high-tech world. It must lure Silva -by means of the most sophisticated technology- into tangibly primitive territory -Scotland- in order to conquer him. Are they kidding? Silva is a joke. No one would be afraid of his antics. But I do get the impression that the writers and producers of ""Skyfall"" fear modern technology. They clearly don't understand a thing about it. They want you to think it's spooky.""Skyfall"" did make me nostalgic...for James Bond. What can be said for an action film that has an unappealing protagonist, no sympathetic or compelling characters, lasts 2 hours and 20 minutes, and whose action sequences are so dull that I didn't notice that they were action sequences after the first one? Where is the entertainment value in this film? James Bond was an iconic action hero, because men all wanted to be him and women all wanted to sleep with him. He was a brash, principled, bon vivant. He enjoyed life. And he wanted to accomplish something. Daniel Craig's Bond hates everyone and everything. He vacillates between being sociopathic and cloyingly sentimental. He promises a woman protection, then waits until she is dead to do something about it. He's driven primarily by self-loathing.

1522162,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B006X040NY,M. Oleson,"[5, 7]","One of the great signature stamps of movies over the last 50 years has been the opening sequences of the James Bond films.  This newest version is no exception and certainly must rank as one of the best.Bond (Daniel Craig) is on the trail of a mysterious evil-doer who has managed to obtain a computer drive that contains the names of deep cover agents who have infiltrated various terrorist organizations.  Bond is shot by mistake by Eve (Naomie Harris), an agent working with him and is believed to have been killed falling into a fast moving river.Now certainly at the 20 minute mark we know Bond isn't actually dead.  After a few months of pounding down booze on some unknown island he learns that his boss ""M"" (Judi Dench) is under scrutiny for losing the agent names.  Bond resurfaces and manages to track down the culprit in southern China.Bond films have another common component throughout the years.  The villain.  They are always rich.  They are always powerful.  And they always want more.  As one of the best bad guys in memory, Oscar winner Javier Bardem plays Silva, a one-time MI6 agent and computer genius.  He doesn't necessarily want more money and power, he wants revenge.  He's after ""M"" who he feels betrayed him years earlier.Directed by another Oscar winner, Sam Mendes, ""Skyfall"" focuses on the actors.  Terrific performances are coaxed out of Craig, Bardem and especially Dench, another Oscar winner.  Mendes also manages to blend in many older Bond staples, not the least of which is 007's pristine Aston Martin DB:5, with some new; including updated versions of old characters (Q and Ms. Moneypenny) along with another surprise.While the heart of this film is in the story and the emotion rarely seen in the franchise, ""Skyfall"" is not short on what makes it Bond.  There are glorious visuals, especially in Shanghai, a cool gadget or two (but no exploding pen), hot girls and a memorable final act.  While I have a fondness for all the Bond films and all the actors who played 007, this one may be at the top of the heap.BLU RAY UPDATE (3-17-13):  This was my favorite movie of 2012, so watching it again on Blu ray was high on my list of things to do.  If anything, I'm more impressed.  Not having to worry about plot details, I was able to focus on the production values, soundtrack, editing and yes the quality of the transfer.  All of which equal my appreciation for the film.Here, James Bond (Daniel Craig) is presumed to have been killed, but resurfaces when he sees his boss ""M"" (Judi Dench) under political pressure for allowing a list of embedded NATO agents to be acquired by the bad guys.  Both Bond and ""M"" are tired and seem unlikely to continue.  But they do.  Director Sam Mendes (who also contributes one of the 2 commentary tracks) masterfully integrates a change for future Bond films including new characters who blend in nicely with the past.One of the things I noticed is the great photography in this film which sparkles in this 1080p transfer.  The colors are off the chart.  The blacks are black.  Check out the gorgeous shot of Shanghai at night, dense with colorful lighting against the black sky.  When the story moves to Scotland, the palette changes to greens, blues and browns as the topography changes.  From what I can tell, this transfer does not include any IMAX images shown in some theaters.Like the video, the audio track is exemplary.  Using the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, a properly set up room bristles with activity including a marvelous opening sequence.  As opposed to every other Bond film, the conclusion of the scene results in Bond and MI6's failure to get the bad guy(s).  As the Oscar winning song by Adele plays over the credits, we yearn for the next event.  The surrounds are active with waterfalls, crashing glass, helicopters, gunfire and explosions throughout the film.  The dialog is always crystal clear throughout.Extras include a second commentary track by the current generation of Broccoli producers and production designer Dennis Gassner, a 59 minute ""Shooting Bond"" documentary, a short set of ""Skyfall"" premier interviews, a trailer, a soundtrack promo and a slew of other film trailers.",5,BLU RAY UPDATE:  Ranks as one of the best Bonds,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,4184,"['One', 'great', 'signature', 'stamps', 'movies', 'last', '50', 'years', 'been', 'opening', 'sequences', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'newest', 'version', 'exception', 'certainly', 'must', 'rank', 'one', 'best.Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'trail', 'mysterious', 'evil-doer', 'who', 'managed', 'obtain', 'computer', 'drive', 'names', 'deep', 'cover', 'agents', 'who', 'have', 'infiltrated', 'various', 'terrorist', 'organizations', 'Bond', 'shot', 'mistake', 'Eve', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'agent', 'working', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'falling', 'fast', 'moving', 'river.Now', 'certainly', '20', 'minute', 'mark', 'know', 'Bond', ""n't"", 'actually', 'dead', 'few', 'months', 'pounding', 'down', 'booze', 'unknown', 'island', 'boss', 'M', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'scrutiny', 'losing', 'agent', 'names', 'Bond', 'resurfaces', 'manages', 'track', 'down', 'culprit', 'southern', 'China.Bond', 'films', 'have', 'common', 'component', 'years', 'villain', 'are', 'always', 'rich', 'are', 'always', 'powerful', 'always', 'want', 'more', 'one', 'best', 'bad', 'guys', 'memory', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Silva', 'one-time', 'MI6', 'agent', 'computer', 'genius', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'want', 'more', 'money', 'power', 'revenge', 'M', 'who', 'betrayed', 'years', 'earlier.Directed', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'Skyfall', 'focuses', 'actors', 'Terrific', 'performances', 'are', 'coaxed', 'Craig', 'Bardem', 'especially', 'Dench', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Mendes', 'also', 'blend', 'many', 'older', 'Bond', 'staples', 'not', 'least', '007', 'pristine', 'Aston', 'Martin', 'DB:5', 'new', 'including', 'updated', 'versions', 'old', 'characters', 'Q', 'Ms.', 'Moneypenny', 'surprise.While', 'heart', 'film', 'story', 'emotion', 'rarely', 'seen', 'franchise', 'Skyfall', 'not', 'short', 'Bond', 'are', 'glorious', 'visuals', 'especially', 'Shanghai', 'cool', 'gadget', 'two', 'exploding', 'pen', 'hot', 'girls', 'memorable', 'final', 'act', 'have', 'fondness', 'Bond', 'films', 'actors', 'who', 'played', '007', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'top', 'heap.BLU', 'RAY', 'UPDATE', '3-17-13', 'was', 'favorite', 'movie', '2012', 'so', 'watching', 'again', 'Blu', 'ray', 'was', 'high', 'list', 'things', 'do', 'anything', ""'m"", 'more', 'impressed', 'Not', 'having', 'worry', 'plot', 'details', 'was', 'able', 'focus', 'production', 'values', 'soundtrack', 'editing', 'yes', 'quality', 'transfer', 'equal', 'appreciation', 'film.Here', 'James', 'Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'presumed', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'resurfaces', 'when', 'boss', 'M', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'political', 'pressure', 'allowing', 'list', 'embedded', 'NATO', 'agents', 'be', 'acquired', 'bad', 'guys', 'Bond', 'M', 'are', 'tired', 'seem', 'unlikely', 'continue', 'do', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'who', 'also', 'one', '2', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'masterfully', 'change', 'future', 'Bond', 'films', 'including', 'new', 'characters', 'who', 'blend', 'nicely', 'past.One', 'things', 'noticed', 'great', 'photography', 'film', '1080p', 'transfer', 'colors', 'are', 'chart', 'blacks', 'are', 'black', 'Check', 'gorgeous', 'shot', 'Shanghai', 'night', 'dense', 'colorful', 'lighting', 'black', 'sky', 'When', 'story', 'moves', 'Scotland', 'palette', 'changes', 'greens', 'blues', 'browns', 'topography', 'changes', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'transfer', 'not', 'include', 'IMAX', 'images', 'shown', 'video', 'audio', 'track', 'exemplary', 'Using', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'properly', 'set', 'up', 'room', 'bristles', 'activity', 'including', 'marvelous', 'opening', 'sequence', 'opposed', 'other', 'Bond', 'film', 'conclusion', 'scene', 'results', 'Bond', 'MI6', 'failure', 'get', 'bad', 'guy', 's', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'song', 'Adele', 'plays', 'credits', 'yearn', 'next', 'event', 'surrounds', 'are', 'active', 'waterfalls', 'crashing', 'glass', 'helicopters', 'gunfire', 'explosions', 'film', 'dialog', 'always', 'crystal', 'clear', 'throughout.Extras', 'include', 'second', 'commentary', 'track', 'current', 'generation', 'Broccoli', 'producers', 'production', 'designer', 'Dennis', 'Gassner', '59', 'minute', 'Shooting', 'Bond', 'documentary', 'short', 'set', 'Skyfall', 'premier', 'interviews', 'trailer', 'soundtrack', 'promo', 'slew', 'other', 'film', 'trailers']",Skyfall

1522164,AH0PI2S3O1YDP,B006X040NY,MonsterZeroNJ,"[7, 10]","Skyfall is a very interesting and entertaining entry in this 50 year old series in that it gives us all the classic elements that we've come to expect from a Bond film and yet, takes it into new and unexpected territory. Not everyone is going to like where it goes but, I certainly did. The story is actually quite simple. After a mission goes awry, 007 (Daniel Craig) is thought dead but, is actually living in secret, drowning the negative effects of his job with sex and booze. But, when a mysterious and sinister individual targets MI6 and M (Dame Judi Dench) in particular, Bond returns to action despite doubts from some of his superiors that he still can handle the job. Writers Robert Wade, Neal Purvis and John Logan craft a story that is part spy thriller and part Silence Of The Lambs as Bond faces not a villainous organization or government but, one very dangerous and psychotic ex-MI6 agent known as Silva (Javier Bardem) who is bent on avenging what he feels is a betrayal by his former boss, M. It's a daring direction to give this Bond film a more personal focus despite it's scope and having Bond defending, not Queen and Country but, the one person he can even remotely consider family, M, from a man whose motives for revenge are equally personal. And director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road To Perdition) is more then up to the task. Mendes gives the film the epic scope we've come to expect from these moves as the film travels from Turkey to Shanghai and from Macau to London and Scotland but, never looses focus on the characters or story. He directs the action in a refreshingly old fashion manner, no more evident then in the thrilling train set pre-credit sequence. No quick cuts or shaky-cam, just good intense action. The action is what's exciting, not the  camera or editing tricks used to make it exciting. He gets great performances out of his cast. Craig is sensational as a Bond who is a bit burnt-out and bitter yet, is driven by duty and loyalty to return to a life he has a chance to escape... a life that maybe is right for him after all. Bardem is simply brilliant as the demented and dangerous yet, disturbingly flamboyant, Silva. A man who is Bond's equal in many way's but, is demented by his inner pain and thirst for revenge. Dame Judi Dench is great in an expanded role for M. She and Craig are magic together and it's great to see them share so many scenes after Quantum Of Solace kept them apart for almost that entire film. The supporting cast including Naomie Harris (Eve). Ralph Fiennes (Mallory) and Ben Whishaw (a young, computer geek-ish Q) are all excellent and provide great support for the principles. Mendes makes this flick look great with some stunning camera work such as the Blade Runner-esque Shanghai and the moody moors of Scotland. The film is deliberately paced but, it is more thriller then action flick although, there is plenty of the latter. Round that out with a very Bond score by Thomas Newman, a classic Bond theme by Adele and one of the best opening credits sequences in some time and you have a solid James Bond flick that is both charmingly familiar and yet boldly treads new ground.

First, this is the first Bond film to delve into the titular character's childhood.  Specifically, the final climatic scene occurs in Bond's childhood home of Skyfall estate in Scotland.  Second, one of the good guys dies!  Actually, it is a good girl.  For decades, the character M was played by a woman, with Judi Dench occupying the role the past two decades starting with GoldenEye.  In this film, she dies at the end, being the first recurring protagonist to be killed of.  We also see the initiation of MoneyPenny and Q into the Bond franchise, along with M's replacement, Gareth Mallory.  In the midst of all these major events is the movie's story; a renegade MI6 agent exacts his revenge upon the agency in a multi-layered conspiracy of murder and mayhem.  Wrapped up in this are great shootouts, fistfights, car chases, and other action scenes.  My only beef with this film is its digress into the realm of super-heroic action; i.e. Bond taking not one, but two bullets, falling hundreds of feet into raging waters, yet surviving to enjoy life on a tropical beach and then cutting one of the bullets out of himself for some forensic analysis.

Make it in the traditional way and it looks like retread and parody, like Brosnan's last two.  Depart from the traditional and it's not really a James Bond movie, like Quantum of Solace.  This is a series that has had to be remade several times to fit in with the era and to make Bond's exploits interesting.  Skyfall isn't so much a remake as it a back to basics.  Much of it has an old-school feel to it.  Q & Moneypenny are reintroduced and a new M is introduced.  The Bond villain isn't part of some absurd global criminal organization.  He's just a cackling madman From the Connery/Moore days played perfectly by Javier Bardem.  Bardem is the best Bond villain since Sean Bean in Goldeneye.  Craig's Bond isn't some tortured antihero.  He's a professional killer w a smart mouth.  The beauty of James Bond movies used to be how they were pure escapism.  Bond's psychology wasn't explored, much less considered.  He was more of a cypher through which the viewer could live his or her fantasies of jet-setting and saving the world.  The eternal sunshine of 007's spotless mind.  Skyfall edges closer to that.  We get some personal stuff but not nearly the tortured angst of the last two entries.  Skyfall runs well over two hours but doesn't feel too long like most movies do these days.  There's no Bond girl this time around and that is disappointing.  Bond movies tend to work best when there's an element of sexiness to them.  Some of the plot and action sequences are obviously borrowed from other movies like Batman and Die Hard.  Bond works best when he's setting the pace and not keeping up.  Other franchises should imitating Bond.  Judi Dench was always pressing for more screentime and here she gets to be the focus of the entire movie.  Fortunately, she is an excellent actress, so I didn't mind too much.  I like Craig as Bond.  He's a talented actor, so that gives the brain trust a flexibility most of his predecessors didn't.  I'm heartened by the changes they made.  Exactly the kick in the pants this often moribund franchise needed.

Is the party over for 007 and his backdated brand of boyish bravura?This question is on Sam Mendes' mind too. And 007&#8242;s, and M's. This time it isn't just James Bond who is the dinosaur. It's MI6 itself.Previous Bond franchise reboots have been about modernising a diehard chauvinist throwback. That this was quixotic and self-defeating was demonstrated by the effete outputs: Goldeneye. Die Another Day.Sam Mendes addresses that head-on: Daniel Craig is scarred; haggard; careworn. Old. He looks like he's had enough, even before being snipered off the roof of a goods wagon during a punch-up over a high Turkish gorge in the opening scene.To underline the air of finality, as Bond's body hits the water and floats into a truly old school animated opening sequence, a truly old school Bond theme strikes up, and in the fashion of a truly old school Bond chanteuse, Adele sings, to almost exactly the tune of Diamonds are Forever ""This is the end"". Good gracious: they're not declaring the innings closed, are they?It's a question that hangs over the two and a half hours of Skyfall.MI6 has carelessly let its roster of embedded under-cover agents fall into terrorist hands, and now they're being systematically whacked in full view of the world wide web. In trying to retrieve the list 007 has been shot, seemingly dead: collateral damage of a risky shot by his own colleague, Eve (Naomie Harris). A risky shot taken at the direct order of M herself, in knowledge of Bond's jeopardy, we fear to protect herself as much as her department.And now the net is drawing in on M herself. Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), a career bureaucrat, is put in charge of the department. He wants M out in a month. All done the proper way, by dignified retirement: a very British coup.In her eyes she knows her days are numbered, but M is having none of it, not while there's still work to do. Dumbledore repairs to her study where her favourite boy wizard - the boy who lived - awaits. (Forgive me confusing my movie idioms: as the film progresses the similarities become ever more striking)Time to get back to what we do best, James. Old school style. And always, confronting our right to be here: are we still relevant? Are we still understood? In the middle of this social revolution are we still fit for purpose? If we're to best make sure we're not redundant, how should we respond?M's, and Mendes' answer: go back to basics; concentrate on what we know best. Old school.Bond sits in contemplation at the national gallery in front of Turner's painting of the HMS Temeraire, a willowy veteran of the Battle of Trafalgar, being towed by a steampunk tug to be scuttled. He is interrupted by a precocious teenager (Ben Whishaw), who turns out to be the new Q. But this time gimmicks are muted: a palm-print personalised Walther PPK and a miniature radio tracker. Old school. Bond reverts to his old DB5. He's tempted to use the ejector seat on M when she's haranguing him: Old school.Much has been made of Javier Bardem's villain, but this film isn't about the villain. Raoul Silva is no Anton Chigurh; Bardem plays him almost as comic relief. His villainy is barely needed: Skyfall deals in a far more claustrophobic perfidy than him.Things proceed with a sense of scale and grandeur that James Bond has never in my experience attained, for two and a half hours. It feels like there's more at stake than is usually the case; it feels here that, however it ends, the Bond universe will have irreparably changed. And so it turns out. The ending is moving, profound and ingeniously it leaves the franchise ready to embark upon a next decade of adventures, with all the pieces in place.Old school.Olly Buxton",5,"Die another day, MI6",1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,3988,"['Hyped', 'sky-high', 'worldwide', 'media', 'blitzed', 'billboards', 'commandeered', '007', 'glares', 'out', 'corner', 'land.It', 'lot', 'trouble', 'go', 'just', 'Bond', 'film', 'even', 'pause', 'wonder', 'grand', 'Dame', 'franchise', 'fiftieth', 'year', 'lady', 'protest', 'too', 'much', 'party', '007', 'backdated', 'brand', 'boyish', 'bravura', 'question', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'mind', 'too', '007', '8242', 'M', 'time', ""n't"", 'just', 'James', 'Bond', 'who', 'dinosaur', 'MI6', 'itself.Previous', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'reboots', 'have', 'been', 'modernising', 'diehard', 'chauvinist', 'throwback', 'was', 'quixotic', 'self-defeating', 'was', 'demonstrated', 'effete', 'outputs', 'Goldeneye', 'Die', 'Day.Sam', 'Mendes', 'head-on', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'scarred', 'haggard', 'careworn', 'Old', 'had', 'enough', 'even', 'being', 'snipered', 'off', 'roof', 'goods', 'wagon', 'punch-up', 'high', 'Turkish', 'gorge', 'opening', 'scene.To', 'air', 'finality', 'Bond', 'body', 'water', 'floats', 'truly', 'old', 'school', 'animated', 'opening', 'sequence', 'truly', 'old', 'school', 'Bond', 'theme', 'up', 'fashion', 'truly', 'old', 'school', 'Bond', 'chanteuse', 'Adele', 'sings', 'almost', 'exactly', 'tune', 'Diamonds', 'are', 'Forever', 'end', 'Good', 'gracious', ""'re"", 'not', 'declaring', 'innings', 'closed', 'are', 'question', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'Skyfall.MI6', 'carelessly', 'let', 'roster', 'embedded', 'under-cover', 'agents', 'fall', 'terrorist', 'hands', 'now', ""'re"", 'being', 'systematically', 'whacked', 'full', 'view', 'world', 'wide', 'web', 'trying', 'retrieve', 'list', '007', 'been', 'shot', 'seemingly', 'dead', 'collateral', 'damage', 'risky', 'shot', 'own', 'colleague', 'Eve', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'risky', 'shot', 'taken', 'direct', 'order', 'M', 'knowledge', 'Bond', 'jeopardy', 'fear', 'protect', 'as', 'much', 'department.And', 'now', 'net', 'drawing', 'M', 'Gareth', 'Mallory', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'career', 'bureaucrat', 'put', 'charge', 'department', 'out', 'month', 'done', 'proper', 'way', 'dignified', 'retirement', 'very', 'British', 'coup.In', 'eyes', 'days', 'are', 'numbered', 'M', 'having', 'none', 'not', 'still', 'work', 'do', 'Dumbledore', 'repairs', 'study', 'where', 'favourite', 'boy', 'wizard', 'boy', 'who', 'lived', 'awaits', 'Forgive', 'confusing', 'movie', 'idioms', 'film', 'similarities', 'become', 'ever', 'more', 'striking', 'Time', 'get', 'back', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'James', 'Old', 'school', 'style', 'always', 'confronting', 'right', 'be', 'here', 'are', 'still', 'relevant', 'Are', 'still', 'understood', 'middle', 'social', 'revolution', 'are', 'still', 'fit', 'purpose', ""'re"", 'best', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'not', 'redundant', 'how', 'should', 'respond', 'M', 'Mendes', 'answer', 'go', 'back', 'basics', 'concentrate', 'what', 'know', 'best', 'Old', 'school.Bond', 'sits', 'contemplation', 'national', 'gallery', 'front', 'Turner', 'painting', 'HMS', 'Temeraire', 'willowy', 'veteran', 'Battle', 'Trafalgar', 'being', 'towed', 'steampunk', 'tug', 'be', 'scuttled', 'interrupted', 'precocious', 'teenager', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'new', 'Q', 'time', 'gimmicks', 'are', 'muted', 'palm-print', 'personalised', 'Walther', 'PPK', 'miniature', 'radio', 'tracker', 'Old', 'school', 'Bond', 'reverts', 'old', 'DB5', 'tempted', 'use', 'ejector', 'seat', 'M', 'when', 'haranguing', 'Old', 'school.Much', 'been', 'made', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'villain', 'film', ""n't"", 'villain', 'Raoul', 'Silva', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'Bardem', 'almost', 'comic', 'relief', 'villainy', 'barely', 'needed', 'Skyfall', 'deals', 'far', 'more', 'claustrophobic', 'perfidy', 'him.Things', 'proceed', 'sense', 'scale', 'grandeur', 'James', 'Bond', 'never', 'experience', 'attained', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'more', 'stake', 'usually', 'case', 'here', 'however', 'Bond', 'universe', 'will', 'have', 'irreparably', 'changed', 'out', 'ending', 'moving', 'profound', 'ingeniously', 'franchise', 'ready', 'embark', 'next', 'decade', 'adventures', 'pieces', 'place.Old', 'school.Olly', 'Buxton']",Skyfall

Absolutely amazing Bond film, the many accolades given to it are most definitely warranted.  Every actor within the film play their part well, and the story from the opening sequence to the final scene are great.  I appreciated the develving into of Bonds past, we finally get to see why Bond does what Bond does.

1522211,A16C1J5AW2CDRE,B006X040NY,O Shepard,"[5, 7]","It will no doubt reveal my age when I state that I read Ian Fleming before any movie was ever made. I have enjoyed every film, the good and the bad and have always been fascinated how the Bond films reflect changes in both film making and popular culture.  Sometimes, though rarely, The James Bond of film was close to the image that Ian Fleming had in mind when he wrote the original books back in the 1950's and 1960's based on his own experiences during the Second World War and his own personal demons. Sean Connery's early portrayal and the 2 films starring Timothy Dalton came closest to the original character of our violent and troubled super spy and assassin. The world was apparently not ready for the grim reality of  the literary James Bond and preferred the light hearted spy fantasies of the films with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan.  Then came Daniel Craig and the conscious decision by the producers to bring back the James Bond of Ian Fleming's novels. 'Casino Royale' and it's extension 'Quantum of Solace' began the transition successfully. Now we finally have the third film with Daniel Craig and the transition is complete.'Skyfall' is the first James Bond film that can stand on its own independently of the rest of the series. It is a true thriller in the British tradition of  espionage thrillers that go back over 100 years in English thriller novels.  It is no doubt the best film made yet to capture the essence of Ian Fleming's original intent. It will disappoint some who wanted more action, more sexual double entendres, and more humor, but it will please many who have longed for a film that captures the original character and the narrative flow of many of Ian Fleming's novels. Fleming's intent was to recreate the British espionage thriller. 'Skyfall' fulfills that promise in film.Buyers should be aware that this first release of 'Skyfall' is a bare-bones disk and it will be awhile before we get the followup 2 or 3 disc release with all the commentary and bonus features. Personally I am not falling for the studio's get-rich-quick DVD release and will wait for the complete release which I understand will be released in the UK the same day that this abbreviated release set is planned for the USA.UPDATE: Amazon had it wrong in its description of the Blu-Ray. The 2-disc Blu-ray does indeed include commentary and a few extras. The second disc contains digital copies of the film. Unfortunately, the extras are not complete and another release is probably in the future. I hope that it will include the new 1 1/2 hour documentary 'Everything or Nothing'",5,James Bond Grows Up,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,2594,"['will', 'doubt', 'reveal', 'age', 'when', 'state', 'read', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'movie', 'was', 'ever', 'made', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'good', 'bad', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'how', 'Bond', 'films', 'reflect', 'changes', 'film', 'making', 'popular', 'culture', 'Sometimes', 'rarely', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'was', 'close', 'image', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'wrote', 'original', 'books', 'back', '1950', '1960', 'based', 'own', 'experiences', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'early', 'portrayal', '2', 'films', 'starring', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'came', 'closest', 'original', 'character', 'violent', 'troubled', 'super', 'spy', 'assassin', 'world', 'was', 'apparently', 'not', 'ready', 'grim', 'reality', 'literary', 'James', 'Bond', 'preferred', 'light', 'hearted', 'spy', 'fantasies', 'films', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Then', 'came', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'conscious', 'decision', 'producers', 'bring', 'back', 'James', 'Bond', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'novels', 'Royale', 'extension', ""'Quantum"", 'Solace', 'began', 'transition', 'successfully', 'Now', 'finally', 'have', 'third', 'film', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'transition', 'complete', 'first', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'independently', 'rest', 'series', 'true', 'thriller', 'British', 'tradition', 'espionage', 'thrillers', 'go', 'back', '100', 'years', 'English', 'thriller', 'novels', 'doubt', 'best', 'film', 'made', 'yet', 'capture', 'essence', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'original', 'intent', 'will', 'disappoint', 'who', 'wanted', 'more', 'action', 'more', 'sexual', 'double', 'entendres', 'more', 'humor', 'will', 'please', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'longed', 'film', 'original', 'character', 'narrative', 'flow', 'many', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'novels', 'Fleming', 'intent', 'was', 'recreate', 'British', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'fulfills', 'promise', 'film.Buyers', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'first', 'release', ""'Skyfall"", 'bare-bones', 'disk', 'will', 'be', 'awhile', 'get', 'followup', '2', '3', 'disc', 'release', 'commentary', 'bonus', 'features', 'Personally', 'am', 'not', 'falling', 'studio', 'get-rich-quick', 'DVD', 'release', 'will', 'wait', 'complete', 'release', 'understand', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'UK', 'same', 'day', 'abbreviated', 'release', 'set', 'planned', 'USA.UPDATE', 'Amazon', 'had', 'wrong', 'description', 'Blu-Ray', '2-disc', 'Blu-ray', 'indeed', 'include', 'commentary', 'few', 'extras', 'second', 'disc', 'contains', 'digital', 'copies', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'extras', 'are', 'not', 'complete', 'release', 'probably', 'future', 'hope', 'will', 'include', 'new', '1', '1/2', 'hour', 'documentary', ""'Everything"", 'Nothing']",Skyfall

But then, Sean Connery is the quintessential Bond as far as I'm concerned so there was a tough act to follow for all that came after him.  While I will agree with some that this movie felt different, I disagree that it wasn't a Bond movie.  This is the computer age so it made sense MI6 relies on computers more than gadgets.  There were a few, though, but not nearly as many as Bond used to get.One thing that does confuse me a bit - Moneypenny.  This movie made it seem like Bond and Moneypenny just met when she's been there all along.  Which makes me wonder where on the timeline do these Daniel Craig versions fall, anyway? I guess you just have to take it all at face value and not read too much into anything if you really want to enjoy this movie as it stands.By itself, I enjoyed this as an action movie that just happened to involve James Bond.  Maybe it's not a traditional Bond movie but that didn't detract from it for me.  This is my first Daniel Craig Bond, though.  I've seen enough to want to see the first two now when I didn't really care before.I did think the ending was inventive - bypassing the modern gadgets for (ok, I'll say it) McGyver-like substitutes.  I was sad to see that this would be the last film with Dame Judy Dench as M.  I've always liked her but I guess we all have to move on.  I do like Ralph Fiennes as the new M, though.

1522254,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B006X040NY,Ranny Levy,"[4, 6]","The latest of the Bond movies delivers action and adventure just as we've been prepped to expect since the 1960s when Ian Flemings' books first hit the silver scene. The difference between the traditional Bond films and this one is that Bond is shown as a somewhat aging agent who many wish to retire, particularly after he is shot in the opening scene. M has another idea and approves his return to active duty. What I really enjoyed about this film is its introspective aspect. We see Bond returning to the home he grew up in and where his parents lost their lives. When the house blows up, his response is, ""I never liked that house anyway."" But, we meet the house's caretaker who knew Bond as a youngster and hear him talk about worthy of her talents. Daniel Craig's performance is spell-binding. Javier Bardem plays an artful smart and cunning villain. And, Bond's Aston Martin DB5 makes a brief reappearance.  This film is filled with action starting with the opening scene and continuing throughout. It's thoroughly appealing for an adult audience and for teens as well.Here's what our kids have to say: I recently watch the new James Bond movie and it was amazing. I have seen every James Bond movie and this one is by far the best and everyone I have asked agrees. I love the antagonist in the movie and as weird as it sounds I thought that he was pretty crazy but in an acceptable way. The villain's name is Silva and Javier Bardem deserves an Oscar for the great job that he does portraying Silva. While I watched the movie, I was constantly wishing and imagining that I was a British secret agent. This movie follows James Bond (Daniel Craig) who is shot on a mission and ever since his wounding, people are saying the he is too old to still be doing dangerous field missions.  Bond refuses to hang his hat just yet and returns to MI6 when he finds out that M (Judi Dench) is being threatened.  An ex- agent of MI6 seeks revenge on M for reasons only known by them. His name is Silva and he is a psychopath. We find out that M has allowed something to turn him this way later in the movie.  Everything that Silva does or allows to happen is a part of a plan because he is just that much of a genius, but James Bond is determined to best him.  Bond has to go through everything to get to Silva and save M and, as usual, there is a new love interest named Eve (Naomie Harris) who helps him. In order to save M, Bond has to come to terms with his childhood because his parents were killed; and in the final face off Bond leads him to the one place that no one would think - Skyfall, his childhood home.This movie deserves all of the stars in the sky, but since the highest is five; then I give this movie five out of five stars.  I love how all of the James Bond movies have the same concept so that there are no shake ups, and the writers give just enough prediction, but not too much to make the movie predictable. Some of the scenes in this movie have sexual connotations and are violent, so this movie is not appropriate for small children. I recommend this movie for ages thirteen and up because of the mature content.  Victoria B, KIDS FIRST!

Is he just the mindless tool of the British goverment killing mad men who want to take over the world or does he have thoughts and feelings? During the last and most forgettable James Bond movie of the 20+ series, Quantum of Solace, some four years ago, there was a writers strike. The movie was half in production. So rather than stop the movie, non-union non-guild writers finished the plot about hoarding water and it was awful. The producers and people behind the series wanted to do a much better job this time they made a real plot with real character development. Imagine, instead of the usual two dimensional good guys and bad guys, James Bond as a real complex person with realistic motivation. and Judy Dench as ""M"" well motivated also. Will she sacrifice an MI-6 agent to stop a killer? Daniel Craig as Bond might make viewers forget Sean Connery.Androgenous bad guy Javier Bardem has a grudge and blows up MI-6 main building in London! ( Her Majesties Secret Service - the English equivalent of the CIA). The Bond series has always been shot in exotic locations. This was shot in China and Turkey but it also has for the first time London and the bleak austere moody Scottish Highlands, which for some odd reason were never in James Bond movies before! There is also a great scene of Bond jumping into the non-destroyed portion of a moving train!Geniunely funny in places, even pokes fun at other James Bond movies. There is a new ""Q"" section with a new, very young Q who eschews most gadgets!the best Bond of all time? That honor might go to ""Goldfinger"" or ""From Russia with Love"", but this is certainly the most detailed and complex of the series and one of the best and should not be missed. If you think the Bond series is mindless action movies you are in for a pleasant surprise.This movie is actually nominated for academy awards, in minor categories .

After years of chasing the bad guys and suffering one too many injuries and wounds on the job, the world's premier secret agent is beginning to feel his age.In this outing, a noticeably creakier Bond goes in pursuit of an ex-agent who's targeting MI6 and particularly its chief, M, for wrongs he believes he's suffered at their hands.In addition to providing a more relatable Bond - replete with autobiographical back story - and M, &#34;SkyFall&#34; is that rare action movie that actually finds time to probe some surprisingly heady themes amid all the obligatory shootouts and chase scenes (which are excellent, by the way, especially the tour de force opening scene).For instance, the script ponders whether MI6's old-school reliance on secret agents has become a hopelessly antiquated business model for a world in which technology has begun to replace time-consuming footwork and in which the enemy is no longer out in the open but operating in the shadows.The movie also questions M's practice of cutting loose her most loyal and valued agents (Bond included) - essentially treating them as disposable assets - when a greater goal is to be achieved through their sacrifice.The dialogue between Daniel Craig as Bond and Judi Dench as M is some of the best in the whole Bond series, and there is a genuine connection between the two individuals who, although they're working for the same team, often seem more like adversaries than allies.&#34;Skyfall&#34; also provides us with one of the most effective villains we've come across in quite awhile, in the person of Javier Bardem as the former operative who's decided to exact his revenge on the people and the organization that he feels has done him wrong.Director Sam Raimi even manages to achieve some genuine lyricism in his direction, something one almost never finds in an action film.It seems to me that the Bond franchise has really upped its game since Craig hopped aboard in 2006's &#34;Casino Royale&#34; (despite the stumble of &#34;Quantum of Solace&#34;).

Some of the films have been hurt by poor performances by models who couldn't act, such as Denise Richards. None of that nonsense here, great casting. Javier Bardem was particularly good as the villain. This film doesn't have action every second, which is another plus because it makes it feel real instead of cartoon-ish. If you like the tongue-in-cheek things from the older films you may be disappointed, but all of the Daniel Craig versions have been more realistic. The photography in this film is magnificent, just a brilliant production with beautifully shot scenes. Anyone who appreciates cinematography will love watching this. Cinematographer Roger Deakins is one of the greats.

Bond is brash, arrogant, and ultimately, human--and this movie shows him, warts and all.  The relationship with M as played by Dame Judy Dench has been quasi-maternal, but this shows how the characters grew in complexity with each movie, the actors imbuing them with strength and respect, sometimes grudging, for each other and the jobs they had to do.If you don't like James Bond, you might not enjoy this movie.

(Hey, it's Hollywood, that's fine.)I liked this film.  The action was fun but not over the top.  The scenery was very nice - the Shanghai boat scene was lavish. The moody shadow & light show as an assassin gets his rifle loaded up and takes aim.  (But why did Bond let the guy take a shot and kill his target?  That's never explained).The Bond girls were tragic, intensely interesting and Bond's empathy for them was palpable.Enjoyed the back & forth with Moneypenny, as she shaves him closely.  Later they discuss how it's easier to get dressed with an ""extra pair of hands.""  Cute.Yay, we get a ""shaken not stirred"" scene at a Shanghai bar, as Bond is watched closely by a gang of toughs about to kill him.  We get a view of the Connery sports car, the Ashton Martin.Bottom Line:The film made fun of itself at several points, but true Bond fans would get the Easter eggs, and new viewers would be fascinated with the ""origin story"" of our favorite MI6 spy, out in the Scottish Highlands (""Skyfall"").

Bond &#34;dying&#34; and not leaving MI6 until an attack is carried out by a dangerous sociopath on the agency headquarters, killing a vast number of double 0s. In this process we get to see a different Bond, since he struggles with regaining his skills when getting back in action, so he is not the usual efficient killing machine. Due to the nature of the evil Bond faces, this time the action is really close to home, with M being one of the targets. This makes the film all the more thrilling.Of course, there is plenty of action, some time with the ladies and explosions / destruction to last for days.

Is it the greatest James Bond film of all time?  No.  Is it one of the better films in the series?  Yes.  Being more innovative and consistent in its vision, Casino Royale still inches out Skyfall as Daniel Craig's superior 007 outing, but the latest Bond effort certainly manages to breathe new life into a series that for years was just going through the motions.Skyfall's greatest strength is the quality of its acting.  The cast is simply impeccable, and kudos must be given to Craig, who while giving his best in playing a burnt-out James Bond with a too-severe crewcut nonetheless is gracious enough to share the limelight with his co-stars.  Judi Dench is wonderfully irascible and vulnerable as M -- you'll feel the ground of her career shifting beneath her feet just as she does.  Special attention must be given to Berenice Lim Marlohe, who has much too little screen time as the very Fleming-esque Severine, Ben Whishaw, who could easily have come across as yet another smarmy jackass Hipster, and Ralph Fiennes, who once was rumored to be considered for the Bond role but is wonderfully stalwart and studious here as Mallory.  Naomie Harris is sexy yet sweet as Eve (you'll find out why), leaving only Javier Bardem's Raoul Silva as the weakest link -- hardly his fault because the part is underwritten.In fact, the biggest problem with Skyfall revolves around how much you'll say ""I've seen this before.""  And I'm not just talking about following the Bond formula.  Skyfall seems to have taken most of its sensibility from The Dark Knight, to the point that too many elements are begged, borrowed, and stolen.  The most obvious is Silva himself, who is basically a redux of Heath Ledger's Joker, though not quite as magnetic.  Despite all the hype, he's no Goldfinger or Dr. No.  Luckily, an actor of Bardem's caliber finds a way to make him more interesting than he is written.  But it doesn't stop there.  A motorcycle chase through a Turkish bazaar will remind you of the mall scene from the other movie, and there are more than a few music cues from Thomas Newman's score (not counting Adele's predictably moody ballad) that will make you think Batman instead of James Bond.  Some moments, such as a jail sequence, will in addition evoke Silence of the Lambs, and the climax, essentially lifted from Straw Dogs, also finds a way to crib the second Star Trek movie, right down to camera shots.  Shoehorning in an older, world-weary Bond to service the plot also seems a bit too early for a series that only six years ago introduced us to the youthful precursor to the 007 we know.What makes Skyfall work best, though, is that director Sam Mendes is as interested in the performances as he is in the formula.  In fact, the emotional fireworks are much more interesting than the action sequences, which seem surprisingly flat by comparison.  I've read that the original version of the film was much longer and am hoping that the deleted sequences will be returned in a director's cut, as I get the impression that additional character moments were sacrificed in favor of the set pieces.  That might explain why the only line Craig delivers poorly -- a bit about Scotch -- seems misplaced given the build up the rest of the movie provided and why the re-appearance of the Aston Martin DB5 seems inconsistent with Casino Royale.  There are also shots in the trailers for Skyfall that are obviously not in the film.  For casual fans of Bond, the character's complex family history might also be confusing.  The script as we have it does minimal effort to fill in the details and makes me wonder what else was sacrificed.  (Of course, a solution might have been to have Daniel Kleinman's so-so opening credits sequence focus less on forecasting what we'll see in the movie and more on Bond's personal history.)  My impression is that these missteps are less the result of intention on the part of the filmmakers and more the result of having to pare down a film to something more manageable for theaters.  While it can save a disastrous director's cut, editing can also often leave a fragmented artistic vision.Ultimately, Skyfall brings us back to where it all started.  Given that the previous two films seem to have done the same thing, it is all getting a little tedious, but nonetheless Skyfall, for its limitations, is great entertainment and certainly the most visually stylish Bond we've seen in a long time.  The great Roger Deakins' cinematography is as usual beautiful and he has adjusted to digital cameras with panache.  I hope when I go to Shanghai in a few months it's as stunning as it appears in this film.  The same goes for the suits and costumes, and I'm glad to see that the fitted suit has finally returned with grandeur.  The Bond series is now firmly poised to legitimately pursue fitting into the sensibilities of the previous films of the series, and so long as the studios don't sit around with their thumbs up their posteriors for another four years, should portend an even better 007 film to come.  Skyfall returns Bond to the role of knight errant as opposed to angsty rebel but without losing the manly confidence that Craig brings to the role -- it's good to have you back, Mr. Bond.",5,"While

1522365,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B006X040NY,Steven Aldersley,"[8, 12]","The first thing I noticed about Skyfall was the vast amount of talent involved. With apologies to Sean Connery, Daniel Craig gives the best acting performances of any Bond. It's not that he's a better actor than Connery, but he's asked to play the role with a lot more realism, and that works well for me.Other actors of note are even better than Craig: Judi Dench is wonderful as M, Javier Bardem is over the top and hilarious as Silva, and Ralph Fiennes appears as Gareth Mallory. It's rare that Oscar winners and nominees have so many key roles in an action movie.In addition to the acting talent, Sam Mendes (American Beauty) directs, Thomas Newman (10 Oscar nominations) is responsible for the score, and Roger Deakins (9 Oscar nominations) does his usual excellent job with the cinematography.While I enjoyed Quantum of Solace, it was definitely flawed. It was too short, so everything felt rushed. It was also rather unbalanced, with five major chase scenes in the first 30 minutes, and an abundance of quick cuts and shaky-cam. Skyfall has a couple of major chase scenes, but the action never eclipses the overall story.The plot is pretty simple. A computer hard drive has been stolen, and it contains the identities and missions of MI6 agents. M's computer is hacked and she is informed that the identities of five agents will be released each week. It becomes clear that the knowledge originated from MI6, or from someone with intimate knowledge of the organization.Bond is injured and believed to be dead after an accident early in the movie, but he turns up alive when he feels that his services are needed. However, he's clearly not completely healthy. Is he fit for duty? Is age catching up with him? Would it be dangerous to allow him to resume duty while he is recovering? I like that Bond is portrayed as vulnerable. He can be hurt, and he can make mistakes.Craig's Bond is a different beast from any that have come before. He's colder and tougher, and the campy humor is gone. That's not to say that the humor is completely absent, it's just smarter and funnier. Many of the best lines are possible because of the relationship between Bond and M. Check out the word association scene for an example.Most of the expected elements are present. The movie visits China, Turkey, England and Scotland. There's obviously a new Bond girl, but she's in fewer scenes than you might expect. The music, action sequences and humor all add to the familiar feel. There's even a few references to previous Bond movies, and fans will love the inspired inclusion of an old piece of machinery.The movie also continues to establish characters that we have come to know and love from previous entries in the franchise, but I'll let you make those discoveries for yourself.After 23 movies and 50 years, the Bond franchise is alive and well. Many critics are suggesting that Skyfall is the best Bond movie to date. They may be right, but I can't decide between Skyfall and Casino Royale. Skyfall wouldn't work as well without the relationships and story arc established in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. The three Craig movies don't quite have the depth of the Bourne movies, but the gap is miniscule.Skyfall will appeal to fans of Bond, spy movies, and action movies. I only hope that Craig's next two appearances as Bond are up to this standard.Overall score 4.5/5",5,The most mature Bond movie yet,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,3367,"['first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'Skyfall', 'was', 'vast', 'amount', 'talent', 'involved', 'apologies', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'best', 'acting', 'performances', 'Bond', 'not', 'better', 'actor', 'Connery', 'asked', 'play', 'role', 'lot', 'more', 'realism', 'well', 'me.Other', 'actors', 'note', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'Craig', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'wonderful', 'M', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'top', 'hilarious', 'Silva', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Gareth', 'Mallory', 'rare', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'nominees', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'key', 'roles', 'action', 'movie.In', 'addition', 'acting', 'talent', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Thomas', 'Newman', '10', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'responsible', 'score', 'Roger', 'Deakins', '9', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'usual', 'excellent', 'job', 'cinematography.While', 'enjoyed', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'was', 'definitely', 'flawed', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'so', 'everything', 'felt', 'rushed', 'was', 'also', 'rather', 'unbalanced', 'five', 'major', 'chase', 'scenes', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'abundance', 'quick', 'cuts', 'shaky-cam', 'Skyfall', 'couple', 'major', 'chase', 'scenes', 'action', 'never', 'overall', 'story.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simple', 'computer', 'hard', 'drive', 'been', 'stolen', 'identities', 'missions', 'MI6', 'agents', 'M', 'computer', 'hacked', 'informed', 'identities', 'five', 'agents', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'week', 'clear', 'knowledge', 'originated', 'MI6', 'someone', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'organization.Bond', 'injured', 'believed', 'be', 'dead', 'accident', 'early', 'movie', 'up', 'alive', 'when', 'services', 'are', 'needed', 'However', 'clearly', 'not', 'completely', 'healthy', 'fit', 'duty', 'age', 'catching', 'up', 'Would', 'be', 'dangerous', 'allow', 'resume', 'duty', 'recovering', 'like', 'Bond', 'portrayed', 'vulnerable', 'can', 'be', 'hurt', 'can', 'make', 'mistakes.Craig', 'Bond', 'different', 'beast', 'have', 'come', 'before', 'colder', 'tougher', 'campy', 'humor', 'gone', 'not', 'say', 'humor', 'completely', 'absent', 'just', 'smarter', 'funnier', 'Many', 'best', 'lines', 'are', 'possible', 'relationship', 'Bond', 'M.', 'Check', 'word', 'association', 'scene', 'example.Most', 'expected', 'elements', 'are', 'present', 'movie', 'China', 'Turkey', 'England', 'Scotland', 'obviously', 'new', 'Bond', 'girl', 'fewer', 'scenes', 'might', 'expect', 'music', 'action', 'sequences', 'humor', 'add', 'familiar', 'feel', 'even', 'few', 'references', 'previous', 'Bond', 'movies', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'inspired', 'inclusion', 'old', 'piece', 'machinery.The', 'movie', 'also', 'establish', 'characters', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'previous', 'entries', 'franchise', ""'ll"", 'let', 'make', 'discoveries', 'yourself.After', '23', 'movies', '50', 'years', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'alive', 'well', 'Many', 'critics', 'are', 'suggesting', 'Skyfall', 'best', 'Bond', 'movie', 'date', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'Skyfall', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Skyfall', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'relationships', 'story', 'arc', 'established', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'three', 'Craig', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'depth', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'gap', 'miniscule.Skyfall', 'will', 'appeal', 'fans', 'Bond', 'spy', 'movies', 'action', 'movies', 'only', 'hope', 'Craig', 'next', 'two', 'appearances', 'Bond', 'are', 'up', 'standard.Overall', 'score', '4.5/5']",Skyfall

1522367,A26MJME9IBNETY,B006X040NY,StrangePegs,"[2, 3]","On the surface, Skyfall is a really excellent movie.That's because it's a really excellent movie. If you take it as an individual movie and forget that James Bond already exists. That includes forgetting the previous two Daniel Craig Bond films. As an individual movie, it really only has one flaw: its title. The title is a lie and has nothing to do with the movie at all.Yeah, yeah, I hear those of you out there that have already seen it saying, ""But..."" (and I'm not finishing that sentence, because I'm avoiding the spoiler). It seems pretty obvious to me that the title was arrived at completely separately from the movie. Something like:""Wouldn't Skyfall be a cool title?""""Sure, but it has nothing to do with the movie.""""Well, can't we work it in somehow?""So, yeah, the ""word"" was just thrown into the movie so that it could be used as a title and has absolutely no meaning whatsoever. I felt a little bit cheated by that. But not really enough for it to take away from the movie experience overall. It's sort of like the pricker you get in your finger while picking blackberries; it's annoying, but it's not gonna keep you from enjoying the cobbler.So for the movie itself:The action was great. There was only one bit that I thought really strained plausibility (it had to do with a subway train), so that was pretty good. But, then, these new Bond films have been better at ""keeping it real"" than some of the older ones.The acting was great. Daniel Craig is a great Bond, and, of course, Judi Dench is just great. Ralph Fiennes is also in this one, and he was surprisingly good. I say ""surprisingly"" because, while he can be great, he is not always great, and this seemed like the kind of role where he was more expected to look good rather than be good, but he was quite good, and I'm glad that his character is one that will (should) be returning.The tech... well... there's a lot of computer stuff in this, hacking and all sorts of things like that, and, mostly, that was okay, but...So I was there with my IT/techie friend, and there's this scene where Q is explaining some computer something-or-other with a lot of technobabble, and my friend just starts laughing. Not LOLing or anything, just a sustained chuckle. So I know whatever he was going on about was gibberish, because my friend does the whole computer thing. I'm fairly technologically challenged (just ask my wife), so I probably wouldn't have noticed if he hadn't been laughing; I mean, I don't know what they're going on about either way. Well, except for the part where I just sort of assume that it's all meaningless technobabble anyway.However, as much as I enjoyed it as an individual movie, I was more than a little let down with the movie in terms of its relationship to the other Bond films. There are two main reasons for this:1. With Casino Royale and the re-boot of the Bond franchise, they created an ongoing story line. Quantum of Solace, while not the greatest Bond film as an individual movie, was an excellent continuation of that story. It felt like they were putting things in place for something really cool, and I was intrigued by where they were going. With Skyfall, though, they just drop that whole story line and, at the moment, have no plans to go back to it. This is incredibly disappointing, and, for that reason, despite how good Skyfall is on its own, it is, itself, also disappointing.2. Skyfall feels like even more of a re-boot than Casino. There is a grasp in this one to make this Bond the definitive Bond. The Bond. An attempt to sweep away all earlier versions, while still giving a nod to them, and actually make this 007 James Bond. I can't be more explicit than that without giving spoilers, but I just want to say that I wasn't entirely happy with this aspect of the movie in relation to the other Bond movies.

1522393,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B006X040NY,The People's Critic,"[4, 6]","Skyfall marks the Bond franchise's 50th year and 23rd film in that time. For those familiar with the franchise, it is not rare to see the world of Bond tweaked, updated, modernized, and ""freshened up."" Skyfall is a very different Bond film, in that regard. It seems director, Sam Mendes goes out of his way to saturate his film with thematic trappings that chastise the egoism of youth and praise the wisdom of age. This is an intriguing direction to take, but it does slightly miss the mark.In Skyfall, Daniel Craig reprises the legendary role for his third time. After a tragic mishap in Turkey, Bond finds himself off the grid and at a crossroads. A surprise attack on MI 6 forces his hand to once again enter the fray of espionage where he is met with doubt and reservation both by M (Judi Dench) and newly appointed Chairman of Intelligence, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). It seems the world of espionage has become a digital one and the artistry of the field operative is becoming superfluous. Nonetheless, Bond is reassigned to active duty to track down an ex-operative and cyber-terrorist (Javier Bardem), fueled by revenge against those in the British government whom he believes betrayed him.The Bond films that rest on a revenge storyline are historically some of the weakest entries in the history of Bond, and this one fits nicely in that group as perhaps the best of the weak. The action starts strong in classic Bond style, as 007 chases down a terrorist with a hard drive that contains all of the identities of undercover agents throughout the world. Bond and M's relationship is explored in Skyfall in much more depth than ever before, and this film does advance the mythology of Bond a bit more than some other previous entries. However, the film does hit a snag as Bond goes through the motions of tracking down leads throughout China. It is in China where Bond delivers his line, ""Bond, James Bond,"" and it is also where he drinks a Heineken (Heineken reportedly paid $45 million dollars to have Bond sip their brew in Skyfall). Furthermore, the climax, which does reveal the film's namesake, also feels a bit clunky and hokey. While Bardem's villain, Silva does provide some memorable scenes, he is simply a melodramatic excuse to allow Bond to remind us not to underestimate the power of some spit and elbow grease. Silva is, instead, a missed opportunity to chew the scenery along side some of the best Bond villains.Skyfall is not a bad Bond movie, and it is certainly not a bad movie. Sam Mendes accomplishes his goal of creating a heavy-handed thematically driven exploration of Bond's inner workings. This is by no means a bad idea. However, this deviation from expectations is not executed with precision and allows the film to flounder in parts. There are some sequences that are absolutely heart pounding and the film leaves us eager to see what's next; just don't expect to see your Heineken investment pay off just yet.

We just got done viewing it.The color and sound on the DVD was great, no problems there. I won't ruin the movie for you, just give little tidbits of interest.The rugged, more thuggish, more ruthless, less games playing, older looking and not as pumped up Daniel Craig (my second best favorite Bond,after the original S.C.) acts great in this movie. However the one who INMO did an even better acting job was ""M"" (Judy Dench). She did a shady bad deal to another agent years ago and that comes back to haunt her big time. Silva (Javier Bardem ) plays a good waco villain/ex agent) in this movie. INMO, this was the best role of ""M"" in any of the Bond 007 movies.Typical lots of action. Daniel Craig gets severely injured and is written off as dead, accidently killed by field agent Eve (Naomie Harris). He comes back to help after MI6 is attacked, members killed and ""M""s life is threatened by a madman ex ""betrayed"" agent.Scenery was great and we see some of Bond's ancestry and former home in Scotland....Skyfall. Also brought back was the old machine guns, ejector seat Astro Martin. Shades of Goldfinger. Great!I was impressed that there was very little weirdo improbable futuristic devices. Even the new, nerdy young  ""Q"" doesn't pull out too many weird inventions for Bond. There was Bond's gun electronically imprinted so only he can fire it. Cool. This INMO was a more believable Bond movie. Less clowning around and more of the darker side of ""M"" and the love/hate relationship Bond has with his boss.A very good, enjoyable 007 movie with ""M"" Judy Dench playing a great role. A great ending I won't ruin. INMO probably around 6 or 7 out of 23 as the best Bond 007 movie.  4 3/4 stars.Again this movie was more about ""M"" and her past and her shady deal she did to an ex agent.

I am old enough to have seen Goldfinger in a first run theater, an experience I will never forget.  For the longest time, I thought Goldfinger was the best Bond movie.  The Aston Martin, Jill Masterson (the golden girl), Oddjob, Pussy Galore, and one of the best movie theme songs of all time--lightning captured in a bottle.  For those of you too young to appreciate it, there were two actors working in the 60s who defined ""cool"", and Sean Connery as James Bond was one of them.Now, there is Skyfall, which I believe is the best of the Daniel Craig as Bond movies.  Great song (will Adele ever make a mistake?), tight script, thoughtful direction, and they brought the Aston Martin back.  Others have said it better than I, but this is a good movie, not just a good Bond movie.  That said, if you watched Goldfinger and Skyfall back to back, you would see that Goldfinger and Oddjob are comic book villains, and you would know, just as I knew when I first saw it, that Bond would figure out how to stop the atom bomb from going off.  No real villains, and no real suspense.  Is it still fun to watch?  You betcha.  Every time.  It's that combination of things that simply work without wearing out.Is Skyfall better?

What would it take to send you back into the fray? Money, love, fear?James Bond (played by Daniel Craig for the third time) and fellow MI6 agent Eve (played by Naomie Harris) have tracked a thief carrying a stolen hard drive with confidential information to a train. After an exhausting chase and an epic amount of destruction, Bond and the thief are locked in a physical struggle. With the thief in her sights, Eve (Harris), on orders from M (played by Judi Dench for the seventh time) takes the shot, misses, and sends 007 plummeting to the water below while the hard drive and the thief are lost. M (Dench) is summoned before a government committee where one member, Gareth Mallory (played by Ralph Fiennes), encourages her to retire. While en route to MI6 headquarters, their servers are breached and, while M watches helplessly in traffic, their offices are destroyed killing several agents. Bond, having taken his fall from the tracks as an opportunity to retire, learns of the attack while watching television in a bar. His return to government service is typically atypical. He breaks into M's home, reports for duty, and asks how he can be of service. Before returning to duty, Bond must submit to both a physical and a psychological exam. Despite failing both, a desperate M puts Bond back in the field, for lack of a better idea.This being a Bond movie, there is, of course, a great deal more to the story. The moment we are introduced to the true villain, Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem) marks the Bond series' return to cinematic greatness. Bardem is truly terrifying and every time you think you've figured out his master plan, he shocks you. The introduction of Ben Whishaw as 007's liaison to Q branch breathes new life into an element of the franchise that I assumed had simply been abandoned with the departure of Pierce Brosnan and the death of the much-beloved Desmond Llewelyn. I understand that many Bond fans saw Quantum of Solace as a failure.

1522418,A3Q5IRZ3ZJV4P3,B006X040NY,"Valueminded ""leadpedal2""","[7, 10]","This is the third of the new Bond movies, and my least favorite by far.  It lacks the usual warmth, humor and sex appeal of the Bond franchise.  It also lacks the star power of a criminal mastermind. There are no outstanding, memorable characters in this film at all.The trend of making the Bond franchise completely sexless has continued.  The director made one half-hearted attempt at a sexy scene in a shower, but it was completely sanitized for your protection and over quicker than a Saturday night at the preacher's house.  It wouldn't even make a Quaker blush.  I guess it's ok to show a human body torn into pieces by bullets, but God forbid we should see a naked breast.Also continued is the casting of no-names as supporting actors.  The only bright point in the movie is newcomer Naomie Harris as Moneypenny.  Unfortunately, the new Q is a pathetic and entirely forgettable little twerp, twice as arrogant but half as clever as he thinks he is.  He has all the appeal of wet cardboard and gets completely played by the villain.  Sadly, he survives.The biggest villain in this movie is definitely the script.  The story started out strong but completely fell apart.  There were huge missed opportunities and holes in the plot.  For example, the villain went through years of planning just to show up at a conference with two buddies and a handgun?  That's the big climax?  No holding the world hostage, no WMDs?  Pretty pathetic.  When he escapes through the subway, the chase scene is a complete snore until Bond catches up.  But it would have been 1,000 times more impressive if the director had done the scene the same way they did the opening escape sequence of Indiana Jones running from the falling rock in the tomb in Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It would have made a much bigger impact to see Bond running from a runaway train like that, instead of just a simple crash.  A wasted chance, if you ask me.But the ultimate kiss of death for Skyfall was that there were far too many contrived scenes.  By the end it was obvious that everyone from the director to the screenwriter and even the actors were all just mailing it in.  In one example, the head of MI6 is under threat of terrorist attack, but they only assign one agent and one fat guy for her protection.  Then later, when the villain shows up for the final confrontation, he isn't eager to get in the house and kill... giving M enough time to escape and Bond enough time to plan a nasty surprise. I found myself wishing that they would just kill M already- the witch truly deserved it for betraying one of her agents, after all. But it got worse.  Take the scene when the villain caught Bond while running across a frozen pond covered with thin ice... What were the options?  One, you could just gun him down. Two, you could shoot the ice and send him into the frozen water to drown. So of course it's option three- one of the henchmen walks out onto the ice, close enough for Bond to grab his machine gun and shoot a hole in the ice and escape.  Everyone knows the best way to cover someone with an automatic weapon is from only inches away, after walking out onto thin ice.  That was just stupid.  Finally, Bond shows up to kill the villain by throwing a giant knife into his back, one that appeared mysteriously out of nowhere.  Perhaps the Lady in the Lake gave it to him when she rescued him from drowning, which is the only way anyone could have escaped death after falling into that frozen pond, BTW. I won't even mention the underwater struggle in which Bond choked his victim to death with his knee and still had breath enough to swim 25 feet up to the surface in sodden winter clothing...What is this, Harry Potter?I certainly didn't find myself wishing I were in Bond's place after this movie, as I have done in the past.  There was no awe, no hero worship. But without the charm and the reckless savoir-faire made famous by the previous Bonds, you don't have a hero anymore.  All you have left is an annoying little prick-ly toad. That is my impression of Daniel Craig as Bond after this movie.  I won't be falling for anymore hype from this group.",2,"Lacks punch, star power",1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,4132,"['third', 'new', 'Bond', 'movies', 'least', 'favorite', 'far', 'usual', 'warmth', 'humor', 'sex', 'appeal', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'also', 'star', 'power', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'are', 'outstanding', 'memorable', 'characters', 'film', 'all.The', 'trend', 'making', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'completely', 'sexless', 'continued', 'director', 'made', 'one', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'sexy', 'scene', 'shower', 'was', 'completely', 'sanitized', 'protection', 'quicker', 'Saturday', 'night', 'preacher', 'house', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'Quaker', 'blush', 'guess', 'ok', 'show', 'human', 'body', 'torn', 'pieces', 'bullets', 'God', 'should', 'see', 'naked', 'breast.Also', 'continued', 'casting', 'no-names', 'supporting', 'actors', 'only', 'bright', 'point', 'movie', 'newcomer', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'Moneypenny', 'Unfortunately', 'new', 'Q', 'pathetic', 'entirely', 'forgettable', 'little', 'twerp', 'twice', 'arrogant', 'half', 'as', 'clever', 'appeal', 'wet', 'cardboard', 'completely', 'played', 'villain', 'Sadly', 'survives.The', 'biggest', 'villain', 'movie', 'definitely', 'script', 'story', 'started', 'out', 'strong', 'completely', 'fell', 'apart', 'were', 'huge', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'holes', 'plot', 'example', 'villain', 'went', 'years', 'planning', 'just', 'show', 'up', 'conference', 'two', 'buddies', 'handgun', 'big', 'climax', 'No', 'holding', 'world', 'hostage', 'WMDs', 'Pretty', 'pathetic', 'When', 'subway', 'chase', 'scene', 'complete', 'snore', 'Bond', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'been', '1,000', 'times', 'more', 'impressive', 'director', 'had', 'done', 'scene', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'opening', 'escape', 'sequence', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'running', 'falling', 'rock', 'tomb', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'bigger', 'impact', 'see', 'Bond', 'running', 'runaway', 'train', 'instead', 'just', 'simple', 'crash', 'wasted', 'chance', 'ask', 'ultimate', 'kiss', 'death', 'Skyfall', 'was', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'contrived', 'scenes', 'end', 'was', 'obvious', 'everyone', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'even', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'mailing', 'one', 'example', 'head', 'MI6', 'threat', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'only', 'assign', 'one', 'agent', 'one', 'fat', 'guy', 'protection', 'Then', 'later', 'when', 'villain', 'up', 'final', 'confrontation', ""n't"", 'eager', 'get', 'house', 'kill', 'giving', 'M', 'enough', 'time', 'escape', 'Bond', 'enough', 'time', 'plan', 'nasty', 'surprise', 'found', 'wishing', 'would', 'just', 'kill', 'M', 'already-', 'witch', 'truly', 'deserved', 'betraying', 'one', 'agents', 'got', 'worse', 'Take', 'scene', 'when', 'villain', 'caught', 'Bond', 'running', 'frozen', 'pond', 'covered', 'thin', 'ice', 'What', 'were', 'options', 'One', 'could', 'just', 'gun', 'down', 'Two', 'could', 'shoot', 'ice', 'send', 'frozen', 'water', 'drown', 'So', 'course', 'option', 'three-', 'one', 'henchmen', 'walks', 'out', 'ice', 'close', 'enough', 'Bond', 'grab', 'machine', 'gun', 'shoot', 'hole', 'ice', 'escape', 'Everyone', 'best', 'way', 'cover', 'someone', 'automatic', 'weapon', 'only', 'away', 'walking', 'out', 'thin', 'ice', 'was', 'just', 'stupid', 'Finally', 'Bond', 'up', 'kill', 'villain', 'throwing', 'giant', 'knife', 'back', 'one', 'appeared', 'mysteriously', 'nowhere', 'Perhaps', 'Lady', 'Lake', 'gave', 'when', 'rescued', 'drowning', 'only', 'way', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'escaped', 'death', 'falling', 'frozen', 'pond', 'BTW', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'underwater', 'struggle', 'Bond', 'choked', 'victim', 'death', 'knee', 'still', 'had', 'breath', 'enough', 'swim', '25', 'feet', 'up', 'surface', 'sodden', 'winter', 'clothing', 'What', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'wishing', 'were', 'Bond', 'place', 'movie', 'have', 'done', 'past', 'was', 'awe', 'hero', 'worship', 'charm', 'reckless', 'savoir-faire', 'made', 'famous', 'previous', 'Bonds', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'hero', 'anymore', 'All', 'have', 'left', 'annoying', 'little', 'prick-ly', 'toad', 'impression', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'falling', 'anymore', 'hype', 'group']",Skyfall

Believed to be dead, MI6 finds their last, best hope to prevent information exposing agents embedded in terrorist organizations worldwide almost as dead in the water as Bond.Bond stays out of the public eye enjoying ""death"" but returns to offer his services to a very surprised M (Judi Dench)when MI6 is blown apart by Silva (Javier Bardem)a terrorist determined to take revenge against M and the agency at all costs.Bond unexpectantly finds that he has far more in common with Silva than he ever thought.END OF SPOILERS:When it was announced that dramatic director Sam Mendes was going to tackle the latest Bond film, there was a mixture of surprise and trepidation as he had never tackled an action film before. Mendes' experience as a director of stage and screen came in handy allowing him to develop a Bond film with more dramatic depth and heft than might have occurred otherwise.Many Bond films rise or fall (Skyfall)based on the set pieces in the film i.e., the action sequences embelished with plenty of stunts. ""Skyfall"" opens with an exceptionally good one that measures up to the stunning opening for ""Casino Royale"". Bond films also rise and fall based on how complex and interesting the villian is in the piece. Bardem does a good job creating a fascinating bad guy whose grip on his sanity is slippery at best. Bardem makes Silva much more interesting than your standard Bond villian and, perhaps, almost as colorful as Goldfinger or Blofeld. Now that EON productions and United Artists/MGM/Sony ownNever Say Never Again (Blu-ray Version)and the rights to Blofeld, maybe we'll see that character reintroduced in the next installment.The script by Joshua Logan with Neal Puris & Robert Wade effortlessly incorporates elements of older Bond films (in a nice tip of the hat in one scene toGoldfinger (50th Anniversary Repackage) [Blu-ray]), as well as, introducing new variations on old characters.Featuring (for the first time) some of the best known actors of British stage and screen, ""Skyfall"" sets a new standard for Bond films measuring up to the best reboot to feature CraigCasino Royale (Blu-ray + DVD)and expanding to incorporate popular touches from previous films.The Blu-ray looks terrific with a strong, detailed presentation. The audio is equally impressive with an immersive mix.The special features are another thing entirely. While the commentary track by director Mendes is terrific (noting tributes to other films and directors) and the one featuring producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli provides nice detail as well, the featurettes (which can be viewed as a single documentary if you choose)are a bit on the superifical side particularly when compared to the terrific ones for the classic Bond films. Still, they aren't bad--they do cover interesting material just not in depth by comparison to what we've seen in the past.We also get a standard DVD included with the Blu-ray as well as the option to watch the film via Ultra Violet.Bond's latest adventure returns luster to the series as the so-so reception forQuantum of Solace [Blu-ray]. Actor Daniel Craig who has added a primal edge to Bond is signed up for at least two more outings. I'm hoping that they will be as good as this one and continue to develop the material that we see here in ""Skyfall"".Highly recommended.",4,"Silva: ""What's Your Hobby?""

Well, it's mainly about M and Bond just happens to be a part of it.The general theme of this movie is that M, M16, and Bond himself are being outclassed by a more modern and sophisticated enemy. Rather than have someone who can infiltrate and shoot the crap out of bad guys, they need operatives who can hack computers and stop digital terrorists from taking over.Okay, what's great and what's not so great about this movie? Let's go:GREAT:- Action scenes are absolutely fun to watch.- The one-liners are great.- We get to see a bit of Bond's origins.- There's a lot of character development for Bond and M.- The final battle scene ties up the movie nicely and is oh so fitting for the theme of the film.- Well acted, and Judi Dench is a pleasure to see in action.The -not- so great:- The villain was said to be a ""brilliant"" agent. But he does nothing to show why he's brilliant, except being able to hack and plan things. I was expecting him to at least show off some martial arts skills or incredible marksmanship. NOPE!- Why do director's insist on putting bad wigs on Javier Bardem?- I didn't really understand why something in the villains mouth could change his facial appearance. They make no reference as to what it is or even try to explain it.- The final confrontation with the villain is VERY anticlimactic.- The characterization of the villain felt inconsistent. One moment he's ready to kill M, in the next, well... you'll see for yourself at the end of the movie.- The way Javier Bardem portrayed the villain, made him seem rather weak.
