I thought it was interesting that every person on this show was totally bangin, and hot.  I like how a lot of the ""jobs"" or ""tasks"" in real Reality speak, was something designed to show off their HAWT bodies.  I also notice this being the first RW I ever saw where sex between the participants was encouraged (indirectly, condoms in the bathrooms, double and triple showers?) and so prevalent between multiple folks throughout the season.I wouldn't be surprised if the personality tests weren't geared to bring together potential lovers in the screening process.  I saw a couple match ups that seemed quite natural.I think this was a fine show, but I miss the ""grittiness"" of New York, or San Francisco.  Puck was one ugly dude, but he was damn interesting.  And Omarosa (I know she was on The Apprentice) wasn't exactly eye candy, if you know what I'm saying.MC White said:  Pretty good.  Interesting and smokin' hot women!

745880,A3N7N36QAVHBT8,B00008NV4M,Ian,"[13, 17]","I'll first start out by saying this.  I have religiously watched the Real World since it began.  Along with millions of other viewers.  It has been one of those captivating little shows that spark your curiousity.  But, Las Vegas by far has been my favorite season.  It also brought the ""metaphorical"" death to the real world.  Las Vegas had the most beautiful cast, the most sex, alcohol, fights, and for a first, there was no homosexual thrown in the mix.  (Not that I'm against any of the above listed things. LOL)  But, all of those things are the cause of its death.  It was just an explosion of this excess and hedonism and sense of ""fakeness"" that runied the real worlds that follow.  Paris-sucked, San Diego-sucked, Philladelphia-sucks at the moment.  I would have honestly been quite happy if the Real World would have just ended with Las Vegas.  It should have been the great ending. It is an awesome mix of many things.  Its over the top and I love it.  When you watch it, you will believe me. The DVD set is great.  And amazon.com is the best place that has the lowest price for it.  I really hope that the MTV producers get on the ball and start releasing the other seasons.  Enjoy this season.

745881,A116TUHKGCCY2O,B00008NV4M,Jonathan Martin,"[3, 5]","I love MTV's Real World. But the Las Vegas season has to be the best one yet. The high ratings back me up. You get everything in this season, the fights, the drama, the hook ups, the laughter, every type of emotion is experienced throughout this season. These season consisted of 7 very attractive people in sin city, so you know how it's gonna go down. It's very interesting to see how the cast grow and learn from the experiences that they have to face for the first time. You see the cast deal with all sorts of issues including racism, homophobia, pregnancy, family issues, relationships, health, alcoholism, etc. It's very interesting to watch the relationships of Alton and Itulan, as well as Steven and Trishelle. They both have there ups and downs, but will they end up together at the end? Will Frank ever find the girl of his dreams? Can Brynn make it the entire season without getting kicked out? Will Arissa ever make an effort to change so that she can not be as moody and hot tempered? Everyone on the season fought with someone during the show, but everyone really for the most part got along, and that's partly why we were all drawn to this particular cast. Not to mention all the girls are hot. The one thing i didn't like about the dvd is that the music isn't the same as when it aired, as well as it is censored, but i tend to overlook that. I still give this one 5 stars.There is another dvd which is The Real World Las Vegas, ""You never saw.""This is a great dvd only about an hour or so long but i found it hilarious. It's uncensored and shows some pretty sexy and funny scenes that didn't make the cut on the original broadcast. I would pick this up too if i were you.",5,BEST REAL WORLD SEASON EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1084492800,"05 14, 2004",2004,1690,"['love', 'MTV', 'Real', 'World', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'season', 'be', 'best', 'one', 'yet', 'high', 'ratings', 'back', 'up', 'get', 'everything', 'season', 'fights', 'drama', 'hook', 'ups', 'laughter', 'type', 'emotion', 'experienced', 'season', 'season', 'consisted', '7', 'very', 'attractive', 'people', 'sin', 'city', 'know', 'how', 'gon', 'go', 'down', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'cast', 'grow', 'learn', 'experiences', 'have', 'face', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'cast', 'deal', 'sorts', 'issues', 'including', 'racism', 'homophobia', 'pregnancy', 'family', 'issues', 'relationships', 'health', 'alcoholism', 'etc', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'relationships', 'Alton', 'Itulan', 'as', 'well', 'Steven', 'Trishelle', 'have', 'ups', 'downs', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'end', 'Will', 'Frank', 'ever', 'find', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Can', 'Brynn', 'make', 'entire', 'season', 'getting', 'kicked', 'out', 'Will', 'Arissa', 'ever', 'make', 'effort', 'change', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'moody', 'hot', 'tempered', 'Everyone', 'season', 'fought', 'someone', 'show', 'everyone', 'really', 'most', 'part', 'got', 'along', 'partly', 'why', 'were', 'drawn', 'particular', 'cast', 'Not', 'mention', 'girls', 'are', 'hot', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'dvd', 'music', ""n't"", 'same', 'when', 'aired', 'as', 'well', 'censored', 'i', 'tend', 'overlook', 'still', 'give', 'one', '5', 'stars.There', 'dvd', 'Real', 'World', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'never', 'saw', 'great', 'dvd', 'only', 'hour', 'so', 'long', 'i', 'found', 'hilarious', 'uncensored', 'pretty', 'sexy', 'funny', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'cut', 'original', 'broadcast', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'too', 'i', 'were']",The Real World -  Las Vegas - The Complete Season

I've never watched more than about two minutes of The Real World before I watched this season, so I don't know how it compares to other seasons. But, I really liked it, and it was really interesting, how it shows each person's personalities. I was amazed at how well this was put together.Everybody in this show is beautiful, and Alton and Irulan end up hooking up, as do Steven and Tirshelle. There's a lot of alcohol, dance clubs, flirting and hooking up, and drama. I think there's just one person who doesn't have sex over the six months of the show. And as a technical note, they keep the same censoring (bleeps and blurring) that they had on the original MTV broadcast.The people:*Alton, a guy who's a romantic, but doesn't really know what he wants.*Arissa, she has a tough life, with really mean relatives*Brynn, initially a 'wild child,' who lets her anxiety get the best of her*Frank, the smart thinker*Irulan, she's someone who needs to be the center of attention, and does whatever it takes to put her back in the center of attention*Steven, a wanna-be player with too much heart to be a true player*Trishelle, a small town girl who's flirty and wants romancePros:+Beautiful people+Lots of drama, but not annoying drama+Excellent casting+Excellent filming, direction, editing, technical etc.Cons:-The season doesn't include a 'where are they now,' so it left me wondering what happened",5,"Awesome people, great season",1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,1449,"['first', 'Real', 'World', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'more', 'about', 'two', 'minutes', 'Real', 'World', 'watched', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'other', 'seasons', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'how', 'person', 'personalities', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'put', 'together.Everybody', 'show', 'beautiful', 'Alton', 'Irulan', 'end', 'up', 'hooking', 'up', 'do', 'Steven', 'Tirshelle', 'lot', 'alcohol', 'dance', 'clubs', 'flirting', 'hooking', 'up', 'drama', 'think', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'sex', 'six', 'months', 'show', 'technical', 'note', 'keep', 'same', 'censoring', 'bleeps', 'blurring', 'had', 'original', 'MTV', 'broadcast.The', 'people', '*Alton', 'guy', 'who', 'romantic', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', '*Arissa', 'tough', 'life', 'really', 'mean', 'relatives*Brynn', 'initially', ""'wild"", 'child', 'who', 'anxiety', 'get', 'best', 'her*Frank', 'smart', 'thinker*Irulan', 'someone', 'who', 'be', 'center', 'attention', 'whatever', 'put', 'back', 'center', 'attention*Steven', 'wanna-be', 'player', 'too', 'much', 'heart', 'be', 'true', 'player*Trishelle', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'who', 'flirty', 'romancePros', '+Beautiful', 'people+Lots', 'drama', 'not', 'annoying', 'drama+Excellent', 'casting+Excellent', 'filming', 'direction', 'editing', 'technical', 'etc.Cons', '-The', 'season', ""n't"", 'include', 'are', 'now', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened']",The Real World -  Las Vegas - The Complete Season
