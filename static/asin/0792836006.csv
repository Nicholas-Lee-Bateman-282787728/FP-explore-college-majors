136715,A33L7G4E8CID3,0792836006,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[8, 8]","Guy Hamilton is an opportunistic Australian journalist looking to make his name in Indonesia so that he can go on to bigger and better things. Hamilton (played by Mel Gibson) is lost amid a foreign culture and political machine so competely alien to him and  gets help from Billy Kwan (played in a cross-gender role by Linda Hunt), an educated native who is desperate to do something about the rampant poverty he sees every day. The two develop a partnership: Guy supplies the words, and Billy, the images. However, their partnership undergoes strain due to their contrary aims: Guy wants to break the story of Communist aggression and insurrection, while Billy wants to blow the lid off of the poverty in his country. Guy's response is that people don't want to hear about starving kids. Things are complicated when Guy falls for a British diplomat (Sigourney Weaver, whose beauty and brilliant performance make up for a marginal British accent) who gives him the story he wants, but broadcasting it may just be bad for everyone. At end of the movie, everyone has committed themselves to what they feel is important, and for some, it isn't what one would initially imagine them choosing.This is another 80s gem from Peter Weir, who is simply brilliant in setting up an utterly realistic impoverished Indonesia circa 1965. The acting, as I mentioned, is excellent: Gibson has rarely been better, and Weaver is one of the greatest living actresses today. Linda Hunt got much recognition for the role of Billy, but this is no gimmick or Oscar-bait performance--Hunt shows a compelling portrait of betrayed patriotism. Weir, as in Gallipoli, shows a weakness for the music of the times, and there is some 80s synth in the movie again (this time, from Vangelis). Other than this, though, this is a movie which is compelling all the way through and comes highly recommended from this viewer.",5,Romance and intrigue amid squalor and poverty,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,1886,"['Guy', 'Hamilton', 'opportunistic', 'Australian', 'journalist', 'looking', 'make', 'name', 'Indonesia', 'so', 'can', 'go', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'Hamilton', 'played', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'lost', 'foreign', 'culture', 'political', 'machine', 'so', 'competely', 'alien', 'help', 'Billy', 'Kwan', 'played', 'cross-gender', 'role', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'educated', 'native', 'who', 'desperate', 'do', 'something', 'rampant', 'poverty', 'day', 'two', 'develop', 'partnership', 'Guy', 'words', 'Billy', 'images', 'However', 'partnership', 'undergoes', 'strain', 'due', 'contrary', 'aims', 'Guy', 'break', 'story', 'Communist', 'aggression', 'insurrection', 'Billy', 'blow', 'lid', 'poverty', 'country', 'Guy', 'response', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'starving', 'kids', 'Things', 'are', 'complicated', 'when', 'Guy', 'British', 'diplomat', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'beauty', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'make', 'up', 'marginal', 'British', 'accent', 'who', 'story', 'broadcasting', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'bad', 'everyone', 'end', 'movie', 'everyone', 'committed', 'what', 'feel', 'important', ""n't"", 'what', 'one', 'would', 'initially', 'imagine', 'choosing.This', '80s', 'gem', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'who', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'setting', 'up', 'utterly', 'realistic', 'impoverished', 'Indonesia', 'circa', '1965', 'acting', 'mentioned', 'excellent', 'Gibson', 'rarely', 'been', 'better', 'Weaver', 'one', 'greatest', 'living', 'actresses', 'today', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'got', 'much', 'recognition', 'role', 'Billy', 'gimmick', 'Oscar-bait', 'performance', 'Hunt', 'compelling', 'portrait', 'betrayed', 'patriotism', 'Weir', 'Gallipoli', 'weakness', 'music', 'times', '80s', 'synth', 'movie', 'again', 'time', 'Vangelis', 'Other', 'though', 'movie', 'compelling', 'way', 'highly', 'recommended', 'viewer']",N/A
136716,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,0792836006,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[8, 9]","""The Year of Living Dangerously"" is a film that is felt as well as seen; the steaming heat and stench of the hovel lined streets, the torrential rains, and the confusion and fear of being in the middle of a revolutionary coup become very real on a sensory level. Taking place during the Sukarno regime in 1965 Indonesia, it is also a marvelous love story, and the chemistry between Sigourney Weaver and Mel Gibson is palpable. There are many scenes that are as if we are glimpsing a private, intimate moment, and they are both such a stunningly attractive pair.Linda Hunt, playing a cross-gender role of a Chinese/Indonesian news photographer, won many Best Supporting Actress awards, among them the Oscar, for her superb performance as Billy. Billy sets the stage for the characters in this political thriller, using the people around him in the same way that he guides the intricate shadow puppets he is so fond of. When Guy Hamilton (Gibson) gets transferred to Jakarta as a reporter for an Australian newspaper, Billy shows him the ropes, making sure he meets beautiful British embassy attach&eacute; Jill (Weaver), knowing that love between them will be inevitable.A brilliant re-teaming of Gibson, director Peter Weir, and cinematographer Russell Boyd, from the 1981 masterpiece ""Gallipoli,"" this is an equally extraordinary film in its own way, and both films are works of art that get better with each viewing. Unfortunately, the recent releases of this film, whether on VHS or DVD, are of inferior quality, and do not have the clarity or color reproduction of an old VHS I used to own.  Nevertheless, even a less than perfect transfer is better than nothing, and still worth owning.Filmed in the Philippines and Australia, it has an atmospheric score by Maurice Jarre, which includes an excerpt from Vangelis' ""Opera Sauvage.""

Beverly""","[1, 4]","This is perhaps the most serious and socially redeeming film that Mel Gibson has done, it is up there with Braveheart on my list of favorite Gibson films would probably fall in the top 100 of my favorite all time films if I ever made such a list..  Real magic in acting is the performance given by Linda Hunt as she plays the part of a man most convincingly.  Her portrayal of an Indonesian insider is very good.  I am a big Gibson fan, and like almost all his films, but this movie is more than just a good movie well acted.Up until just recently this movie was banned in Indonesia and for good reason, well, at least  for good reason if you happen to be part of a corrupt government.  It shows the darker side of  revolution and reveals what most governments in backwards and corrupt parts of the world would like to remain hidden; their policies usually result in a huge class of very poor.Gibson plays a British reporter freshly arriving in Indonesia, he meets some other reporters doing the usual reporting but  he gets on an inside track that takes him into the seat of power and also into the country to meet the other side.  It really isn't a story about the setting and times so much as it is a story about the people, friendship, loyalty and the terrible realization that life isn't fair or kind to most of the earths inhabitants but that friendship and love between people are enduring.Even though the film is somewhat dark, I don't feel like it is a &quot;downer&quot; kind of movie, but it is definitely a &quot;thinking/feeling&quot; movie and not at all like the action/adventure/thriller type of movies that Gibson later becomes famous for.

136719,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792836006,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","I've been toying with the idea of watching this film for over a year now.  It's been sitting on my DVR for about that long, and everyone I know was raving Linda Hunt here, telling me that it was the best supporting turn of the 80's (not quite, but really, really, really close) and so I recorded it and then forgot about it, got preoccupied and watched countess other films before finally sitting down a few weeks ago to watch this with the wife.  The film, for me, is a bit of a miss, but there is no denying that Hunt and the powerful point she makes with her character and riveting performance is not to be missed.I'd watch this movie again, even though as a whole it disappoints me, just to see her.The film takes place in Indonesia during the political upheavals of the mid-60's.  Centering on a group of Caucasian journalists, `The Year of Living Dangerously' attempts to give us an outsider's viewpoint of an insider's knowledge.  The cast of characters (everyone is mysterious, even our protagonist) include an Australian correspondent named Guy who makes a good impression on a photojournalist with good connections named Billy who happens to match Guy up with a beautiful insider named Jill, who is only days from returning home.The film does a decent job of showcasing the horrible conditions of Indonesia, not just physically but emotionally, with everyone's loyalties being torn by political unrest.  For me though, the film tends to lose focus when it tries too hard to incorporate a sense of romantic entanglement between Guy and Jill, and when you incorporate Billy's ambiguous attachment to the pair (is he in love with one, both or neither of them) it becomes rather distracting.  At times the film also can drag a bit, especially when the conversations turn wordy and the dialog gets quiet.  Parts of the film can be riveting and completely engrossing, but others really take away from the film as a whole.The performances all work well, but no one steps up to the plate quite like Linda Hunt here.  Her gender bending performance (yes, she plays a man) is astonishing, completely transformative, but regardless of that `gimmick', she really invests huge amounts of commitment and emotional connection to this character.  In fact, this film is summed up in the understanding of Billy Kwan, his cause, his political feelings, emotional arrest and his final (dramatic) decisions.  Mel Gibson is decent and Sigourney Weaver works her usual magic, but the standout by a country mile is Hunt.Yeah, I recommend this one.  See it for Hunt, and yes, there is enough here to legitimize your time and attention.  I just wish that it would have had a tighter grasp on the real meat of the story instead of playing to commercial desires and throwing in that sloppy love story.",3,Maybe it's just not that dangerous...,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,2783,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'toying', 'idea', 'watching', 'film', 'year', 'now', 'been', 'sitting', 'DVR', 'long', 'everyone', 'know', 'was', 'raving', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'here', 'telling', 'was', 'best', 'supporting', 'turn', '80', 'not', 'quite', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'close', 'so', 'recorded', 'then', 'forgot', 'got', 'preoccupied', 'watched', 'countess', 'other', 'films', 'finally', 'sitting', 'down', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'watch', 'wife', 'film', 'bit', 'miss', 'denying', 'Hunt', 'powerful', 'point', 'character', 'riveting', 'performance', 'not', 'be', 'missed.I', ""'d"", 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'even', 'whole', 'just', 'see', 'her.The', 'film', 'place', 'Indonesia', 'political', 'upheavals', 'mid-60', 'Centering', 'group', 'Caucasian', 'journalists', 'Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously', 'attempts', 'give', 'outsider', 'viewpoint', 'insider', 'knowledge', 'cast', 'characters', 'everyone', 'mysterious', 'even', 'protagonist', 'include', 'Australian', 'correspondent', 'named', 'Guy', 'who', 'good', 'impression', 'photojournalist', 'good', 'connections', 'named', 'Billy', 'who', 'match', 'Guy', 'up', 'beautiful', 'insider', 'named', 'Jill', 'who', 'only', 'days', 'returning', 'home.The', 'film', 'decent', 'job', 'showcasing', 'horrible', 'conditions', 'Indonesia', 'not', 'just', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'everyone', 'loyalties', 'being', 'torn', 'political', 'unrest', 'film', 'lose', 'focus', 'when', 'too', 'hard', 'incorporate', 'sense', 'romantic', 'entanglement', 'Guy', 'Jill', 'when', 'incorporate', 'Billy', 'ambiguous', 'attachment', 'pair', 'love', 'one', 'neither', 'rather', 'distracting', 'times', 'film', 'also', 'can', 'drag', 'bit', 'especially', 'when', 'conversations', 'turn', 'wordy', 'dialog', 'quiet', 'Parts', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'riveting', 'completely', 'engrossing', 'others', 'really', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'whole.The', 'performances', 'work', 'well', 'one', 'plate', 'quite', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'here', 'gender', 'bending', 'performance', 'yes', 'man', 'astonishing', 'completely', 'transformative', 'regardless', 'gimmick', 'really', 'huge', 'amounts', 'commitment', 'emotional', 'connection', 'character', 'fact', 'film', 'summed', 'up', 'understanding', 'Billy', 'Kwan', 'cause', 'political', 'feelings', 'emotional', 'arrest', 'final', 'dramatic', 'decisions', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'decent', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'usual', 'magic', 'standout', 'country', 'mile', 'Hunt.Yeah', 'recommend', 'one', 'See', 'Hunt', 'yes', 'enough', 'here', 'legitimize', 'time', 'attention', 'just', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'tighter', 'grasp', 'real', 'meat', 'story', 'instead', 'playing', 'commercial', 'desires', 'throwing', 'sloppy', 'love', 'story']",N/A

136722,A1BJOEQSRX2IBM,0792836006,"Bertin Ramirez ""justareviewer""","[4, 4]","This is one of those rare films that is difficult to categorize. It could easily be mistaken for a political thriller but it is not, it could have  worked as a romance but Weir went for the big picture. So it is basically a  political drama that is very heavy on mood and atmosphere. Peter Weir and  Mel Gibson had successfully teamed up two years earlier with 'Gallipoli'  and created one of the most powerful war films of all time. They re-teamed  with this film creating a lesser film than 'Gallipoli' but still a very  worthy effort. The film is very heavy on political issues but it doesn't  really matter if you're informed on the subject. Linda Hunt stunned almost  everybody when in 1983 she was nominated in the 'best supporting actress'  category for the Oscars. This was because he played a man in the film so  convincingly that nobody even noticed. But upon repeated viewings one  begins to notice the femininity in her character. But still she delivered a  mesmerizing performance, the best gender-switching performance since Jack  Lemmon in 'Some Like It Hot'. Peter Weir is a very unique and talented  director and he is an expert when it comes to expressing mood as we would  see two years later with his American debut 'Witness' the critically  acclaimed Harrison Ford vehicle that put him in the spotlight. But this  film is one of the most intoxicatingly exotic movies ever filmed. Mel  Gibson is excellent as an Australian correspondent who is thrown into the  turmoil of political upheaval in Indonesia. Sigourney Weaver exudes much  needed sex appeal, but her character was underdeveloped and her performance  was unfocused. Some of the scenes linger in the mind long after the first  viewing. A fascinating exotic drama that succeeds on many levels.

Hustwick,"[1, 1]","Although it's a potentially overwrought story that is being told here -- that of a smoldering post-colonial communist country on the verge of collapse -- Peter Weir's film succeeds where so many others fail by never letting the message overwhelm his characters.  In particular, Linda Hunt portrays a fascinating proto-totalitarian revolutionary which has to be one of the more unique political creatures I've seen in a film. All in, The Year of Living Dangerously is superbly directed, succeeding in portraying a very compelling story of Southeast Asia in the 1960s.

In fact though it is a film about a specific revolution or populist uprising Year of Living Dangerously deals with that situation in a philosophic way, making a fable of all its elements which allows this film to speak specifically to that situation as it unfolds and generally about all such situations that occur with unfortunate regularity in the news from places all over the world where mass starvation undermines a current regimes authority.The film is also about a wealthy nations role in such circumstance. Mel Gibson plays an Australian journalist and that allows him to report events as they occur but not have to get involved in them or think about what they mean. That changes however when Mel meets Linda Hunt. Her character teaches Mel how to care about the people not just the events and that is the most fascinating relationship in the film. Sigourney Weaver is the daughter of an English colonial administrator but now that the political climate is a threatening and perilously unstable one the English are departing. Her father is pompous and very English, his intentions are good ones but his methods have been ineffective because from his lofty English perch he can not see the real needs of the people. Mel falls for his daughter who as a free spirit and free thinker cares for the people and understands their needs in a way her father could not. It is not surprising that Linda Hunt likes her and wishes to see she and Mel together. And she has a fascination with shadow puppets that makes her think of herself as something of a puppet master in the Mel and Sigourney love affair. However there is another puppet show going on and that is the political one. Linda Hunt may play the puppet master in the private sector but other people are pulling the strings in the public arena. Disillusion follows and a very exciting finale.  Really one of the few films of the last thirty years I would call perfect in every way. Complex enough to give you a new slant on these events every time you view it.

Nilges ""Author, 'Build Your Own .Ne...","[3, 22]","...like Casablanca, you can put this baby on while flossing and getting ready for work, since its moral seriousness gives it eight legs or more.It should be noted that along with Gallipoli, TYOLD was part of an Australian-cultural response to widespread suspicion of US involvement in the 1975 removal of the popular and charismatic Gough Whitlam from Australia's Prime Minstership, in which archaic constitutional procedures were used to remove Whitlam on royal authority alone...apparently and to this day because of his redistributionist policies and his refusal to cooperate with US foreign policy, after Australia's experience as a US ally in Vietnam.Gallipoli showed how Colonial troops, whether white or ""black"" as in the case of Sikhs and Gurkhas, were thought of by the British (including the overrated Churchill) as cannon fodder and military lab rats.The Year of Living Dangerously has an extremely unflattering picture of an American journalist, Pete Conrad, a careerist animal whose idea of a good time is buying sex in a graveyard because with ""real"" women he's a dud.As such, at its release in 1981, Weir expressed a willingness to separate Oz film from the Hollywood machine. Revenge appeared in the mid-1980s with the rise of Paul Hogan, a no-talent who made farcical films about a ""Crocodile Dundee"" who the audience was called upon to admire...in Fascist scenes including one in which the Croc walks on top of people's heads in the subway.Weir's genius in The Year was that he was able to show real people motivated as such by something more than greed and fear, the usual motivators of people in Hollywood product. In Casablanca transcendance is reserved to the end by the Hollywood law that the lead ""cool"" character has to stay hard-boiled (which is to say wounded by exchange relations) until the last possible minute, although Film Noir product such as Out of the Past played with this rule.Here, however, Billy Kwan, disturbingly for a patriarchal/adolescent played by a woman, is a presence from the beginning of the film whose function is at first to annoy Pete Conrad.Paul Hogan, in fact, nearly identified Gallipoli and Weir when in a mid-nineties Playboy interview Paul Hogan, in the manner of the pseudo-alpha star, spoke with false authority about mass motivation, saying that Australian men liked World War One a whole bunch, because they got to ride horses and fight other mobs.Hogan was a buffoon and Gallipoli created a quiet revolution in the travel industry as thousands of grandchildren of the Australian men slaughtered to no purpose at Gallipoli booked passage to Istanbul.As to another reviewer's white guilt, I hope the fashion returns. Bung Sukarno was an imperfect man as the film makes all too clear, but so was Winston bloody Churchill, and Westerners love to make apologies for flawed leaders up until, and beyond, the point at which the special prosecutor serves the leader with a writ, while holding leaders of the developing world to a Ghandian standard which even the Mahatma did not necessarily meet.As a result of Western hysteria over the ""loss"" of a canal which should be a common waterway in the first place, the fashion became blame the victim with the result that today, vast stretches of the developing world, especially but not only Central America, are new wastelands. Sukarno had no friends in 1965 because he told truth to power and refused to give the US cozy access to oil and support in Vietnam, and was as a result overthrown in a bloodbath by the Moslem generals.Meanwhile, the US was enjoying its fat years. A modicum of guilt would have prevented the return of colonialism as deadly farce, and as seen today in Iraq.",5,Classic,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,3687,"['Casablanca', 'can', 'put', 'baby', 'flossing', 'getting', 'ready', 'work', 'moral', 'seriousness', 'eight', 'legs', 'more.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Gallipoli', 'TYOLD', 'was', 'part', 'Australian-cultural', 'response', 'widespread', 'suspicion', 'US', 'involvement', '1975', 'removal', 'popular', 'charismatic', 'Gough', 'Whitlam', 'Australia', 'Prime', 'Minstership', 'archaic', 'constitutional', 'procedures', 'were', 'used', 'remove', 'Whitlam', 'royal', 'authority', 'alone', 'apparently', 'day', 'redistributionist', 'policies', 'refusal', 'cooperate', 'US', 'foreign', 'policy', 'Australia', 'experience', 'US', 'ally', 'Vietnam.Gallipoli', 'showed', 'how', 'Colonial', 'troops', 'white', 'black', 'case', 'Sikhs', 'Gurkhas', 'were', 'thought', 'British', 'including', 'overrated', 'Churchill', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'military', 'lab', 'rats.The', 'Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously', 'extremely', 'unflattering', 'picture', 'American', 'journalist', 'Pete', 'Conrad', 'careerist', 'animal', 'idea', 'good', 'time', 'buying', 'sex', 'graveyard', 'real', 'women', 'dud.As', 'such', 'release', '1981', 'Weir', 'expressed', 'willingness', 'separate', 'Oz', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'machine', 'Revenge', 'appeared', 'mid-1980s', 'rise', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'no-talent', 'who', 'made', 'farcical', 'films', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'who', 'audience', 'was', 'called', 'admire', 'Fascist', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'Croc', 'walks', 'top', 'people', 'heads', 'subway.Weir', 'genius', 'Year', 'was', 'was', 'able', 'show', 'real', 'people', 'motivated', 'such', 'something', 'more', 'greed', 'fear', 'usual', 'motivators', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'Casablanca', 'transcendance', 'reserved', 'end', 'Hollywood', 'law', 'lead', 'cool', 'character', 'stay', 'hard-boiled', 'say', 'wounded', 'exchange', 'relations', 'last', 'possible', 'minute', 'Film', 'Noir', 'product', 'such', 'Out', 'Past', 'played', 'rule.Here', 'however', 'Billy', 'Kwan', 'disturbingly', 'patriarchal/adolescent', 'played', 'woman', 'presence', 'beginning', 'film', 'function', 'first', 'annoy', 'Pete', 'Conrad.Paul', 'Hogan', 'fact', 'nearly', 'identified', 'Gallipoli', 'Weir', 'when', 'mid-nineties', 'Playboy', 'interview', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'manner', 'pseudo-alpha', 'star', 'spoke', 'false', 'authority', 'mass', 'motivation', 'saying', 'Australian', 'men', 'liked', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'whole', 'bunch', 'got', 'ride', 'horses', 'fight', 'other', 'mobs.Hogan', 'was', 'buffoon', 'Gallipoli', 'created', 'quiet', 'revolution', 'travel', 'industry', 'thousands', 'grandchildren', 'Australian', 'men', 'slaughtered', 'purpose', 'Gallipoli', 'booked', 'passage', 'Istanbul.As', 'reviewer', 'white', 'guilt', 'hope', 'fashion', 'returns', 'Bung', 'Sukarno', 'was', 'imperfect', 'man', 'film', 'too', 'clear', 'so', 'was', 'Winston', 'bloody', 'Churchill', 'Westerners', 'love', 'make', 'apologies', 'flawed', 'leaders', 'up', 'point', 'special', 'prosecutor', 'leader', 'writ', 'holding', 'leaders', 'developing', 'world', 'Ghandian', 'standard', 'even', 'Mahatma', 'did', 'not', 'necessarily', 'meet.As', 'result', 'Western', 'hysteria', 'loss', 'canal', 'should', 'be', 'common', 'waterway', 'first', 'place', 'fashion', 'became', 'victim', 'result', 'today', 'vast', 'stretches', 'developing', 'world', 'especially', 'not', 'only', 'Central', 'America', 'are', 'new', 'wastelands', 'Sukarno', 'had', 'friends', '1965', 'told', 'truth', 'power', 'refused', 'give', 'US', 'cozy', 'access', 'oil', 'support', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'result', 'overthrown', 'bloodbath', 'Moslem', 'generals.Meanwhile', 'US', 'was', 'enjoying', 'fat', 'years', 'modicum', 'guilt', 'would', 'have', 'prevented', 'return', 'colonialism', 'deadly', 'farce', 'seen', 'today', 'Iraq']",N/A

Certainly the VHS release was never much to brag about -- grainy and awful, really.I had higher hopes for this DVD. Although it won't matter to many, my copy, purchased last year, claims on the back of the box to have two versions of the film -- anamorphic 2.35:1, and full screen. There is no full screen. False advertising, not that many will care, but the discrepancy is strange.The video quality is mediocre on an absolute basis, and compared to contemporary DVD releases it is poor. Watching it, I keep having the sense that several gradations of color intensity have been smudged over -- what's dark is dark, what's light is light, and in-between I have the sense that a lot of detail is being lost. Mostly the picture looks a bit indistinct. The color is fine as far as it goes -- a little on the washed out side, if you ask me.Yes, another viewer noted that the sound quality is uninspiring. Plain old stereo, possibly from an optical track, as far as I can tell. Pretty shabby, considering the caliber of the stars involved and the technical standards DVD buyers come to expect these days.If you haven't seen Year of Living Dangerously, I agree with those who have praised the quality of the film, and you should rent it or borrow it.  Any movie that quotes the gospel of Luke and Tolstoy in the first five minutes is obviously a cut above the average entertainment film. Linda Hunt! What can I say! You believe, absolutely, that she is the diminutive male photographer, Billy Kwan. Linda is the narrator, and more of a star of this movie than Mel Gibson, though Gibson is not shabby at all in his performance either.I hesitate to recommend a purchase.

136736,A2VE83MZF98ITY,0792836006,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[60, 69]","Peter Weir's film 'The Year of Living Dangerously' was shown at a campus film festival during my first year as an undergraduate (a few years after Linda Hunt had won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for playing a male character), sponsored by the departments of political science, journalism, and East Asian studies.The setting is 1965, Djakarta, during a time when Southeast Asia was high on the scope of European radar and coming into more prominence for American eyes. Indonesia was (and is) a big country, with population and resources (both underutilised) the envy of East and West.The dictator Sukarno was playing a dangerous game trying the balance the two, internally as well as in foreign affairs. In the end, it did not pay off for him, and Indonesia has only recently begun to work at achieving a prominence a resource-rich, 100+ million populated country can attain.Into this tight-rope situation dropped Guy Hamilton (Mel Gibson), of the Australian Broadcasting Service, a fresh-faced journalist out to make a mark for himself, sabotaged by his predecessor and professionally ignored by other Western journalists (who had their own headline-deadlines to meet). However, a strange American/Chinese man, Billy Kwan (Linda Hunt), befriends him, and attempts to help him both professionally, personally, and spiritually.Billy takes Guy on a trip through the slums of Djakarta, preaching Tolstoy, charity and compassion, and tries to get Guy to see beyond the headlines. Billy also introduces Guy to Jill (Sigourney Weaver), a British agent planning to leave Djakarta.The tale wanders through politics, personal strife and decision-making, and the beginnings of revolution, climaxing with Billy putting his words into action and suffering a martyr's fate trying to get Sukarno's attention for the suffering poor, and Jill and Guy making a mad dash for the airport before the runways are closed.Those of us with benefit of hindsight know that Guy could have stayed, the communist PKI in fact did not succeed, and he could have continued to write articles and make a mark. But that would not have been as romantic.This movie is one of contrasts--the elegance of a British Embassy cocktail party contrasted with the poverty of the native Javanese; the cooperation of Billy against the ignoring of the other professionals; the native spirituality (which isn't exploited nearly enough) against the materialistic West (made worse when adopted by a native such as Sukarno). The music from Vangelis is an interesting accompaniment (remember Chariots of Fire?) and the cinematography grand in many cases. But subtlety abounds here--you may miss much the first time through.This is an atypical Weir film (but of course, that may be an oxymoron, for is there a 'typical' Weir film?).

A Bowen ""tabithajab""","[2, 2]","Guy Hamilton (Mel Gibson, absurdly young and beautiful in his first big role), is an ambitious, untested Australian journalist on his first overseas assignment to Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1965.  The continuing turmoil in this breathtaking, poverty-stricken country is just the kind of assignment a journo like Hamilton craves. Indonesia -- Jakarta, and, later, Vietnam -- is the hotbed of unrest in the sixties.  And it's his job (and that of all ambitious Western journalists) to record the unrest and, ultimately, the explosions.Director Peter Weir (""Witness"") weaves a haunting and hypnotic tale of power tested and power failed in ""The Year of Living Dangerously.""  Chairman Sukarno, a despot of the first order, is walking a tightrope between the right-wing military and the PKI Communist Party.  Some intelligent journalists, like Billy Kwan (Linda Hunt, in an unforgettable gender-switching role) believe that he is the savior for this doomed island.  Billy befriends Guy, and in the spirit of ""true partnership"", they follow the course of Sukarno's rule.  Billy is an idealist of the first order, seeing only good where good and evil walk hand-in-hand, and, like all idealists, he is outraged out of all proportion when he is proven wrong.  At the end, the viewer is forced to decide who is most to blame -- the idealists or the realists, and our hero, Guy -- he was put on a pedestal, only to fall off, like the human he was.Sigourney Weaver (Gillian), assistant to the military attache, is a stunning presence and the chemistry between she and Mel Gibson is palpable.  She is intelligent and sees far more than she is allowed to show.  Peter Weir's handling of their romance is masterful.  Instead of showing everything, the viewer is treated to a hint of sexuality. Their attraction explodes on the screen and turns this politic drama into something much more.Knowing what we now know about Vietnam and the Indonesian conflict, this movie is a fascinating study in history. Michael Murphy and Noel Ferrier are outstanding in their supporting roles, as are the Indonesian actors (forgive me if I do not recall their names).  This is a movie to watch and savor.

136745,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,0792836006,K. Boullosa,"[5, 6]","""The Year of Living Dangerously"" is my favorite of all Peter Weir's films.  Weir is especially gifted in his ability to convey that intangible quality called ""atmosphere"" in a film, so that it nearly wafts off the screen.  This gift serves Weir well in this story about a young Australian journalist on his first international posting in the volatile region of Indonesia in 1965, just before civil war erupts there.  The film succeeds admirably on several levels: action, romance, character study, and political history.  It has an intensely concentrated feel that is best compared to the smell of certain flowers, like gardenia.Mel Gibson is Guy Hamilton, the young journalist who is sent out to Indonesia to replace his newspaper's outgoing, more experienced man on the spot at short notice.  Guy knows that this baptism by fire is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and he desperately wants to make the most of it.  However, Guy is hobbled by his lack of both experience and the contacts possessed by his predecessor and the other, more senior journalists in Djakarta.  Indonesia, then under the repressive rule of Sukarno, was a tinderbox of competing political movements, among them a passionately dedicated group of Communists looking to overthrow Sukarno and lift the country's population out of its surreal poverty and starvation, the kind of poverty that few in the West have ever seen firsthand.Against this backdrop, both terrifying and exotic, Guy sets out to gain access to the people, information, and stories that the other journalists have.  He has a hard time of it until he gets a sudden break - he meets news photographer Billy Kwan, the physically stunted son of an Asian father and European mother.  Kwan, intelligent and sensitive, and a fine photographer, is nevertheless treated somewhat cavalierly by the other journalists, and he sees in the yet-unformed Hamilton the great friend he has always hoped to meet.  Kwan offers Guy a partnership: ""You for the words, me for the pictures.""  And with that partnership, Kwan also offers Guy contacts that he has withheld from the other journalists.  This allows Guy to craft stories that begin to establish him as a serious journalist.Kwan also introduces Hamilton to his friend, Jill, an aide at the British Embassy in Djakarta.  Jill (Sigourney Weaver) is actually the woman Billy loves, but he knows he has no chance of anything more than friendship with her, so he ""gives"" Jill to Hamilton, who, sure enough, quickly falls in love with her.  Jill's response to Hamilton is equally strong, but she is due to return to Britain within two weeks, and is in the midst of a rather arid affair with her immediate superior in the Embassy, and she resists Hamilton's attempts to become involved.With this framework set up, political and emotional developments begin to take on a life of their own, as the protagonists confront complex realities over which they have far less control than they imagined.  Those realities challenge assumptions, generate tragedy, and force the characters to re-examine and realign their values.The film has a haunting quality and the performances are fine.  First among these is Linda Hunt's performance as Billy Kwan, which was more than fine, and won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar.  Her small stature undoubtedly suggested her for the part, but what she did with it surely surpassed expectations.  The longing for justice and for love; the compassion and frustration; most of all the overly sensitized response to the world around him, are just a few of the qualities that Hunt brings to her characterization.  It is Billy's persona, in the end, that centers the film.Mel Gibson gives a strong performance as Hamilton, searching for glory and self at the same time, and opening up rapidly to the new influences around him, in the form of Billy and Jill.  Sigourney Weaver is less impressive than the other two leads, not least because she speaks like an American trying to sound British, and she fades in and out of the British accent frequently, sometimes in consecutive sentences, sounding British one moment and American the next.  And while this may be terribly sexist to point out, one of the film's flaws is that Mel Gibson, at the height of his devastating youthful handsomeness, is much prettier and more charismatic than Weaver - there is a lack of equality in candlepower between them that makes one wonder what he saw in her.  Weaver's refusal of Gibson's initial advances - how can I put this? - feels unrealistic and actually drew jeers from women in the audience when I saw this on first release.Weaver is usually an intelligent actress but she was an ""off"" piece of casting that tears a hole in the otherwise flawlessly woven tapestry.  The supporting cast is very fine, including Michael Moriarty doing yet another turn as a shallow cad.The cinematography is beautiful, the pacing and script excellent, the characters presented without judgment, left to evolve in response to events.  Lastly, Maurice Jarre (who composed the scores to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and Weir's later film, ""Witness"") composed a delicate and beautiful score that incorporated influences as diverse as the sound of the gamelan and one of Richard Strauss's ""Four Last Songs"".  The score contributes to the powerful sense of place and moment that permeates the film.",4,The Weir Touch with Atmosphere,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,5351,"['Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously',

Also the film reminded me somewhat of ""The Quiet America"", ""Missing"", ""The Killing Fields""...in that it showcases what goes wrong in the third world when there is outside meddling.The romance (between Sigourney Weaver and Mel Gibson) and the social political issues don't fit as well as they could, or only one plotline- preferably the social political- in my opinion may have made this more powerful. But, like the somewhat happy ending, this type of sugarcoating is, unfortunately, usual Hollywood fare. Nevertheless, this may be Gibson's and Weaver's finest roles. It definitely is their mostsocially conscious.Helen Hunt, playing Billy, in a transgendered role, is fabulous and worthy of and OSCAR and more. And the journalists, and other westerners,are also played very well and quite smarmy and, as in the case of the  British General and embassy party, are indicative of the ongoing power andthe somewhat anachronistic roles of empire- particularly the British.Finally I wish the movie could have been a bit longer and offer more depth, but as in 90% of films it couldn't exceed the two hour maximumtradition.

It bears little resemblance to Weir's original portrait of the multicultural hothouse and political tinderbox that was Sukarno's Indonesia in 1965. Sadly, this version is a butchered old print with a muddy, poorly mixed soundtrack. Such a disappointment.Like another reviewer here, I remember the original theatrical release of TYOLD. It was an amazing film that has stayed with me through the years; the story line, script, acting, direction, editing and score were all spot on. And I am still in awe of American actress Linda Hunt's stunning work as the diminative Eurasian male photographer Billy Kwan, the fulcrum of the story. I got this DVD because of her Oscar-winning performance and Maurice Jarre's haunting gamelan music. (Okay, Mel too. He was sooo totally hot then. And his love scenes with Sigourney Weaver were as steamy as the tropical climate they were shot in.)IMO this 1983 film still resonates today. The scenes of grinding poverty and violent political unrest, and the influence of Indonesia's large conservative Muslim population on world events are disturbingly relevant to our own time.I hope Weir's original cut of Living Dangerously will be lovingly restored and reissued one day. That event would solidify his standing as one of Australia's most gifted filmmakers and enhance the filmographies of Hunt and Weaver.

I recall seeing this as a student of international relations, absolutely fascinated that recent history - the end of Sukarno's regime in Indonesia - could actually form the backdrop of a film that portrays a personal and political dilemma to the viewer.  It is not only a great romantic story, but also gets the viewer to think as well as learn about a historical period.Guy, a young man eager to succeed in his only shot at a career as a foreign correspondent, appears in Jakarta during the heyday of non-alignment politics:  neither capitalist not communist, but forging its own way with its one rhetoric.  Though he arrives without contacts, one of whom appears to have sabotaged him by leaving without making introductions for him, he must make a go of it.  To do so, he makes an unusual friend, a dwarf named Billy (played by the phenomenal Linda Hunt), who is the narrator of the story and brilliant observer while also handicapped as a person. Billy makes the connections for Guy, including an extraordinary beauty (Weaver) who works at the British Embassy.  (Billy describes her as a person whose life force burns extremely bright, but who needs committed love to guard against falling into promiscuity and cynicism.  It is a brilliant summation of character, one of many.)  They become passionately involved as events unfold.  I do not want to play the spoiler here, but a believable moral dilemma emerges during the political turmoil.The characters in the film, in my viewing, are wonderfully three-dimensional and fascinating, from journalists to diplomats, spooks, revolutionaries, and the local people.  You see extreme poverty and careers in the making, with disillusionment and hope all rolled into one.  Through the film, the characters also evolve and grow, learning from their mistakes and illusions and tragedies.  Of course, the romance is very very hot, one of the best portrayals I have ever seen of that great youthful passion:  perhaps not meant to survive, it provides a beacon for the rest of one's life.  (There is a wonderful scene where they run a curfew roadblock, laughing as guards shoot at the car and kissing with the naive hunger of youth.)  I was as moved to see this as I was 26 years ago, when I saw it with a special girlfriend in Paris.  The acting is uniformly excellent.In addition, the historical context is accurately portrayed in spite of the fictional characters.  While it might appear quaint to view communist revolutionaries in retrospect, the Cold War was very much alive at the time the film appeared.  Underneath the events, you learn of the horrific consequences of under-development, upon which many of the characters piggyback their careers.  The atmosphere comes alive vividly.  I even allowed my son (9) to watch parts of this with me, explaining the violent politics and history to him.I am very happy to own this film, and will watch it at least once a year.  Perhaps it means so much to me because of the dreams of my youth, but I think that everyone can find things to enjoy in the complexity that the film portrays with such great success.Warmly recommended.",5,"Absolutely great story of youth, commitment, integrity, and politics",1227225600,"11 21, 2008",2008,3164,"['one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'films', 'recall', 'seeing', 'student', 'international', 'relations', 'absolutely', 'fascinated', 'recent', 'history', 'end', 'Sukarno', 'regime', 'Indonesia', 'could', 'actually', 'form', 'backdrop', 'film', 'personal', 'political', 'dilemma', 'viewer', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'romantic', 'story', 'also', 'viewer', 'think', 'as', 'well', 'learn', 'historical', 'period.Guy', 'young', 'man', 'eager', 'succeed', 'only', 'shot', 'career', 'foreign', 'correspondent', 'Jakarta', 'heyday', 'non-alignment', 'politics', 'capitalist', 'not', 'communist', 'forging', 'own', 'way', 'one', 'rhetoric', 'contacts', 'one', 'whom', 'have', 'sabotaged', 'leaving', 'making', 'introductions', 'must', 'make', 'go', 'do', 'so', 'unusual', 'friend', 'dwarf', 'named', 'Billy', 'played', 'phenomenal', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'who', 'narrator', 'story', 'brilliant', 'observer', 'also', 'handicapped', 'person', 'Billy', 'connections', 'Guy', 'including', 'extraordinary', 'beauty', 'Weaver', 'who', 'British', 'Embassy', 'Billy', 'person', 'life', 'force', 'extremely', 'bright', 'who', 'committed', 'love', 'guard', 'falling', 'promiscuity', 'cynicism', 'brilliant', 'summation', 'character', 'one', 'many', 'become', 'passionately', 'involved', 'events', 'unfold', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'play', 'spoiler', 'here', 'believable', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'political', 'turmoil.The', 'characters', 'film', 'viewing', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'three-dimensional', 'fascinating', 'journalists', 'diplomats', 'spooks', 'revolutionaries', 'local', 'people', 'see', 'extreme', 'poverty', 'careers', 'making', 'disillusionment', 'hope', 'rolled', 'one', 'film', 'characters', 'also', 'evolve', 'grow', 'learning', 'mistakes', 'illusions', 'tragedies', 'course', 'romance', 'very', 'very', 'hot', 'one', 'best', 'portrayals', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'great', 'youthful', 'passion', 'perhaps', 'not', 'meant', 'survive', 'beacon', 'rest', 'one', 'life', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'where', 'run', 'curfew', 'roadblock', 'laughing', 'guards', 'shoot', 'car', 'kissing', 'naive', 'hunger', 'youth', 'was', 'as', 'moved', 'see', 'was', '26', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'saw', 'special', 'girlfriend', 'Paris', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent.In', 'addition', 'historical', 'context', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'spite', 'fictional', 'characters', 'might', 'appear', 'quaint', 'view', 'communist', 'revolutionaries', 'retrospect', 'Cold', 'War', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'time', 'film', 'appeared', 'events', 'learn', 'horrific', 'consequences', 'under-development', 'many', 'characters', 'piggyback', 'careers', 'atmosphere', 'alive', 'vividly', 'even', 'allowed', 'son', '9', 'watch', 'parts', 'explaining', 'violent', 'politics', 'history', 'him.I', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'own', 'film', 'will', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'year', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'much', 'dreams', 'youth', 'think', 'everyone', 'can', 'find', 'things', 'enjoy', 'complexity', 'film', 'portrays', 'such', 'great', 'success.Warmly', 'recommended']",N/A

Maybe it is about doing small things to make the world better, but then  reverting to dramatic acts when the small things don't work.Mel Gibson  is a novice reporter for Australian news recently assigned to Indonesia.  He wants to make a splash and climb the reportorial hierarchy.  Billy Kwan  (Linda Hunt in a stellar performance) takes him under his wing and educates  him about poverty and teaches him to recognize the shadow play of politics.  Billy also introduces him to Jill (Sigourney Weaver).  They fall in love  and have a wonderful scene in the rain.  He commits a dramatic  act that costs him dearly.

I wondered also if it would give me any insights into life there.Lots of great narration by the asexual actress Linda Hunt, who is a caucasian woman playing the role of an Australian-Chinese man named Billy Kwan. ""We add our own light to the sum of all light."" He also quotes Luke and Tolstoy. Great cinematography - shadow on window, sound of dripping water, the faces of old men in Jakarta. ""The unseen is all around us, especially in Java.""""That's the great thing about being a dwarf - you can be wiser than anybody, but no one envies you."" Then, when talking to Mel Gibson's Guy Hamilton character, some wicked humor/sarcasm: ""We make a good team. We even look alike. People have noticed - same colour of eyes."" Then there's the line ""and so it begins,"" which I've heard used in The Fantastic Mr Fox film, I wonder if Wes Anderson has that in there as a sort of homage. The Maurice Jarre electronic music is pretty funky, I like it. They run the roadblock like fools. Very sexy driving.Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver have great chemistry, and their romance is interesting, but it's still a film about Billy Kwan, who's the only person in the film who really does anything at all. Gibson is a failed human being, someone who tries to make an impact, but who ultimately betrays his ideals, his friends and himself (making excuses the whole while). A complicated person, like Gibson himself. That's why Billy tells Hamilton ""I created you!"" Maybe that's why I like this film - it leaves you feeling uneasy because of the terrible things that happen. Hunt's academy award for acting is richly deserved - just watch the fading glint in her eyes in Billy's death scene.Kwan's apartment is full of great photographs, and lush life.
