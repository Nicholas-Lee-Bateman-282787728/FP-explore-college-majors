856017,AAWPNN003FRHS,B000621452,Amanda F.,"[197, 228]","Based on the title, I was expecting a little yoga and then some solid drills to help perfect certain belly dance moves. There is a lot of time spent on yoga, particularly the sun poses, which is fine, but the belly dance drills really left me wanting more. She covers hips up/down, full body camel, and chest lift/drop. Each move is given very little time and sadly, these moves that are the basis of our beautiful dance come across as horribly boring on this DVD. For a beginner in a regular class this DVD will give you a bit of extra practice. For an intermediate/advanced student you will watch it once and then likely never again. For those trying to learn Rachel's style, you will not get a thing from this DVD. I found more relevant information on her backbend technique on her newsgroup. Anyway, having said all that, the price is right if you are still curious and have to buy it! And be warned of all these 5 star reviews. On her website Rachel thanks all her fans for rushing to her side and posting reviews to save her slipping sales. Not very professional is it?",3,Ok for the price,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,1075,"['Based', 'title', 'was', 'expecting', 'little', 'yoga', 'then', 'solid', 'drills', 'help', 'perfect', 'certain', 'belly', 'dance', 'moves', 'lot', 'time', 'spent', 'yoga', 'particularly', 'sun', 'poses', 'fine', 'belly', 'dance', 'drills', 'really', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'hips', 'up/down', 'full', 'body', 'camel', 'chest', 'lift/drop', 'move', 'given', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'sadly', 'moves', 'are', 'basis', 'beautiful', 'dance', 'come', 'horribly', 'boring', 'DVD', 'beginner', 'regular', 'class', 'DVD', 'will', 'give', 'bit', 'extra', 'practice', 'intermediate/advanced', 'student', 'will', 'watch', 'once', 'then', 'likely', 'never', 'again', 'trying', 'learn', 'Rachel', 'style', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'thing', 'DVD', 'found', 'more', 'relevant', 'information', 'backbend', 'technique', 'newsgroup', 'Anyway', 'having', 'said', 'price', 'right', 'are', 'still', 'curious', 'have', 'buy', 'be', 'warned', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'website', 'Rachel', 'thanks', 'fans', 'rushing', 'side', 'posting', 'reviews', 'save', 'slipping', 'sales', 'Not', 'very', 'professional']",Tribal Fusion - Yoga Isolations & Drills for Bellydance

I have always thought that belly dancing was yoga in motion. When I saw Rachel Brice ""Tribal Fusion"" I thought it would be perfect.  I am learning tribal style dance. Anyway,  I got the impression that there would be more of a fusion of yoga into the dance- I guess. Instead, it was more like a warm-up before you do some belly dance steps/poses to a drum beat. Was that supposed to be the point?! I hope there is more to it than that! There are lots of repetitions of movements , which is what you have to do when you are learning new moves ( drills) designed to help you with your posture,etc She is a talented teacher  and gives verbal instructions thoroughout.

You should have some dance background, not necessarily belly dance. Rachel Brice models and explains good form but unless you recognize what does and doesn't feel right you could injure yourself.

I knew almost nothing when i first got this tape. I couldn't do a body roll undulation. I couldn't learn it from Amira or Jillina. I didnt have a teacher. I was checking stuff out on you tube. I finally learned how to do it from Rachel on this dvd. This dvd is basic and it's fantastic. Personal attention, go at yr own pace with endless repetitions by the Goddess Herself. I think they did a great job filming this. It feels like she's standing right here next to me. I have Serpentine, too, and I love it. It's like a week long workshop master class, but while even a beginner can get alot out of Serpentine with concentration and practice, this dvd is slower, easier, and totally focussed on  basic fundamentals.

The only downside for me is that there are not too many moves on this. But I don't know why I'm complaining (too eager to immerse myself utterly, I guess) because my quads get so tired from standing in the standard dance posture that I'm constantly stopping to shake my legs out!!  It's a workout for sure, but it's also wonderful for getting some drills on basic (a couple not so basic) moves.  I'd give her more stars if I could!!

856047,A2XVRMODZKON7B,B000621452,Missy Machete,"[0, 0]","Where has this dvd been all my life? Really, where?!I purchased Tribal Fusion Belly Dance: Yoga, Isolations and Drills with Rachel Brice because I am a beginning dancer who also enjoys the calm and serene feeling that yoga brings. I had read so many good reviews on this practice companion and after being very dissapointed with Serpentine (also by Rachel Brice-it's nothing against her or the dvd but I just am not advanced or strong enough yet to get anything out of it besides the yoga) I was happy to find that this practice companion is just what I was looking for.You can break up this workout into 15, 30 or 45 minute sessions. In all honesty, the 15 minute workout was enough to get me sweating. You do work HARD in this DVD. The 15 minute session has yoga at the beginning to warm you up and then Rachel goes into drilling you on hip workouts on the up (I find these to be great fun), body rolls or undulations ( these are extremely challenging for me) and hip workouts on the down (also great fun). The practice concludes with a cool down yoga session.What I like about this DVD is that the combination of yoga and bellydance will result not only in strength, good posture and endurance, but also in a strong core and defined, toned abdomen. This is exactly what I want in a workout.15 minutes every day is not a huge commitment, even if you are working full time like I am. For me it is fully worth it to find those extra minutes each day to fit my practice in.I also really like that with the bellydance moves, Rachel breaks them down and explains them (along with their potential pitfalls) so that even a beginner like myself can follow along and understand how they are supposed to be performed. Her muscle control is such that it helps me see how mine should eventually move. Also, great job on the camera work that shows her feet. Footwork is an important part of any dance routine that is frequently ignored on many other bellydance routines. She does go into doing double time on all the routines; I simply ignore that and do mine at regular speed.I plan on doing the 15 minute practice every day save weekends, then I will do the 30 minute practice. The dance routine at the end is just plain confusing to watch. I wish it showcased Rachel's entire incredible dancing, not just disjointed bits and pieces. I do LOVE the outfit she chose to wear though.

856049,A18AJZ4NYUMFG6,B000621452,Parthena Black,"[72, 76]","Since the title of the DVD says ""belly dance,"" I guess I expected the same type of dancing shown in the other bellydance videos I own. I realize that I probably didn't really understand what ""drills"" were at the time, since we don't use that term in class. This DVD teaches some bellydance moves but focuses more on bodywork that will help you develop the muscles and flexibility needed to perform the moves at the highest level possible.The reason I don't rate this one five stars is due to a safety issue. I have a background in fitness and have practiced yoga for 9 years. The warm-ups in the 15 and 30 minute sessions are not nearly long enough, and I prefer to hold my asanas (stretches) for much longer. Some other videos, such as Jillina's and Atea's Magical Motion caution the viewer to also do their own warm-up. Rachel might have done better to add this as well. Second, Rachel goes right into full forward folds as though it is assumed that everyone who buys the DVD has yoga experience. Basic cautions to start with knees bent if necessary, use the legs and not the back to come up and never force anything are not stressed. Someone with poor flexibility and no yoga background - or common sense - could really injure themselves. Some of us have body proportions that prevent us from getting our heads to touch our knees or shins; for instance, I have long legs and a short torso, so it's not likely that my forward fold will ever look like Rachel's, but it's still a forward fold.Otherwise - it's great. The drills are challenging but as a new dancer I have learned a lot from Rachel about form.  And my hips are building up  - which is one of my goals.All three practice sessions alternate between yoga and isolations. The yoga develops flexibility and the stretches help prevent injury by loosening the muscles before and after drills. The drills are isolation techniques for the hips and rib cage. If you pay attention to the visual of Rachel doing the drills, you will be more conscious of keeping these areas isolated.  You'll be strengthening your legs in the process and working on being conscious of your posture. Undulations/body rolls are also included. This DVD is a workout that teaches bellydance isolation techniques rather than dance. The strength and flexibility you'll develop will give you the body you need to improve your bellydance skills. I mainly use DVD's to develop my dance movements, not so much as a ""workout.""  This will probably be the only one I'll ever use when I do want to feel like doing more of a workout.I love the way that you can choose the length of the practice, especially since this is a very challenging workout. Anyone can find the time to do 15 minutes - and if you find it challenging  you can start with 15 minutes and build up to the longer workout instead of becoming discouraged. It took me about two months of practice to be able to do the hipwork at double-time and to do it without getting winded halfway through - and the drills are not that long! You can also play the 45 minute workout and just skip to the drills and stretches you want or need to do.

Well, nearly a year later, and I've been learning yoga along the way. I have found a new appreciation for this DVD now that I can follow along with the opening yoga sequences. I'd still advise caution to those that are new to yoga or are not very flexible, but now I love them!On to the isolations and the breakdown of them... I LOVE IT! They are broken down at a slow pace, then the pace is quickened. Most especially in the undulations, and the hips on the down. She has possibly the best breakdown and explanation of hips on the down that I've seen. Made it easy for me to follow that step in my class.Some may gripe that Rachel Brice is too skinny, but the one advantage to her being as toned as she is, you can SEE how the muscles are supposed to move in these isolations. She is thin, graceful and toned, not emaciated looking at all.And the performance she does on this DVD? Beautiful! She is so fluid and graceful.

It is a complement to your yoga and your drills, and goes deeper into them than many of us probably would on our own.She is utterly correct, and if you look at the DVD with that mindset, it is fantastic.I am a Roma/ATS dancer, and I find it invaluable in its 15, 30, and 45 minute workouts, for both warming up before I practice my isolations and for deepening my backbends and my rib cage isolations.If you are a yoga enthusiast, you may find this too easy.  If you are highly schooled in dance, and have a very keen body awareness, you may become bored with this.But for those of us who have a day job, and dance, and have a household, this is perfect to make you concentrate on making sure you take  the time to do yoga, which is so important to the dance, and stretch.

Rachel breaks down extremely difficult movements like undulations much better than other tapes, my technique went from average to my own personal best.  What I love about how she drills out the movement is that it actually begins to develop 'muscle memory' which is one of the problems in most bellydance workouts...they don't review the movement enough so that the muscles become adjusted and it then can become second nature.  As for the the yoga I found that it really complements the bellydancing in that it builds strength in the buttocks and the back as well as flexibility all which contribute to the fluidity that you see in her dancing.

856058,A3QFE1H3RUP6Z7,B000621452,"Shantell Powell ""The ShanMonster""","[12, 18]","Today I finally got to try Rachel Brice's DVD Tribal Fusion Belly Dance: Yoga, Isolations and Drills.  I decided to go with the 30-minute practice drills (there are three:  15-, 30-, and 45-minute).  Rachel starts the session off with a sun salutation (for a good warmup) and then with the locust asana (which is excellent for strengthening the lower back).  She then goes into drills for various isolations and locks.  She starts each isolation slowly, going through the muscles which should be contracted or released.  Then each movement is smoothed out and sped up.Some reviewers complain that Rachel doesn't explain why the movements look so different on her.  First of all, Rachel has very little body fat.  Therefore, as each muscle is engaged, it is much more evident than it would be on a less sinewy dancer.  Secondly, her movements are very clean and smooth because she has been drilling on a regular basis.  Although drills are not exciting, repetition and consistency are the key to mastery.  If you follow along with the drills on this DVD on a regular and meticulous basis, you will become a more precise, isolated, and technical dancer.  I have no doubts on this.The video isn't perfect.  One minor flaw is Rachel's camera-shyness.  She never looks directly at the camera, and remains very detached.  Once or twice, it is a bit difficult to see what she is doing when the camera pans so the mirror is directly behind her.  She's wearing dark pants, and the reflection is also dark.  However, the camera continues panning, and before long, it's easy to see what she's doing.  Again, this is a minor problem.The worst thing about the video is the additional performance video.  Rachel does a very interesting dance to a dark and gothy song, and the camera-man decides to get all experimental on us.  During the 3-minute or so performance, there are more than 100 strobe-like cuts.  I can see that they were going for an edgy, music video feel, but considering the audience for this DVD is comprised of people who want to get a better understanding of Rachel's dancing, the edits are inappropriate and frustrating.  It's impossible to follow any one movement to completion.  It would have been much nicer had there been a performance clip which shows the movements in a clear and unchopped fashion.  Edgy, clipped videos could be saved for entertainment rather than educational DVDs.On the flip side, the camera work for the drill section, although not static, is clear and appropriate.  When the camera goes in for a closeup of Rachel's abdomen, it's when she's demonstrating which muscles to contract.  When it flows along the contour of her spine, it's showing the correct alignment during yoga asanas.  Some videos dwell on the incorrect body part (eg. on a dancer's face or chest when the instruction is focusing upon hip or footwork).  This never happens in this DVD.Also, Rachel has a pleasant and strong voice, and she explains each movement clearly.The music (by Pentaphobe) is a minimalistic fusion of dark electronic and Middle Eastern rhythms.  It may not be to everyone's liking, but I enjoy it.I strongly recommend this video to anyone who wants to improve their isolation skills.  I intend on using the DVD frequently.",4,Will help you become a stronger dancer,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,3245,"['Today', 'finally', 'got', 'try', 'Rachel', 'Brice', 'DVD', 'Tribal', 'Fusion', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'Yoga', 'Isolations', 'Drills', 'decided', 'go', '30-minute', 'practice', 'drills', 'are', 'three', '15-', '30-', '45-minute', 'Rachel', 'session', 'sun', 'salutation', 'good', 'warmup', 'then', 'locust', 'asana', 'excellent', 'strengthening', 'lower', 'back', 'then', 'drills', 'various', 'isolations', 'locks', 'isolation', 'slowly', 'going', 'muscles', 'should', 'be', 'contracted', 'released', 'Then', 'movement', 'smoothed', 'sped', 'up.Some', 'reviewers', 'complain', 'Rachel', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'movements', 'look', 'so', 'different', 'First', 'Rachel', 'very', 'little', 'body', 'fat', 'Therefore', 'muscle', 'engaged', 'much', 'more', 'evident', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'sinewy', 'dancer', 'Secondly', 'movements', 'are', 'very', 'clean', 'smooth', 'been', 'drilling', 'regular', 'basis', 'drills', 'are', 'not', 'exciting', 'repetition', 'consistency', 'are', 'key', 'mastery', 'follow', 'along', 'drills', 'DVD', 'regular', 'meticulous', 'basis', 'will', 'become', 'more', 'precise', 'isolated', 'technical', 'dancer', 'have', 'doubts', 'this.The', 'video', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'One', 'minor', 'flaw', 'Rachel', 'camera-shyness', 'never', 'directly', 'camera', 'very', 'detached', 'Once', 'twice', 'bit', 'difficult', 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'when', 'camera', 'so', 'mirror', 'directly', 'wearing', 'dark', 'pants', 'reflection', 'also', 'dark', 'However', 'camera', 'panning', 'long', 'easy', 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'Again', 'minor', 'problem.The', 'worst', 'thing', 'video', 'additional', 'performance', 'video', 'Rachel', 'very', 'interesting', 'dance', 'dark', 'gothy', 'song', 'camera-man', 'decides', 'get', 'experimental', '3-minute', 'so', 'performance', 'are', 'more', '100', 'strobe-like', 'cuts', 'can', 'see', 'were', 'going', 'edgy', 'music', 'video', 'feel', 'considering', 'audience', 'DVD', 'comprised', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'Rachel', 'dancing', 'edits', 'are', 'inappropriate', 'frustrating', 'impossible', 'follow', 'one', 'movement', 'completion', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'nicer', 'had', 'been', 'performance', 'clip', 'movements', 'clear', 'unchopped', 'fashion', 'Edgy', 'clipped', 'videos', 'could', 'be', 'saved', 'entertainment', 'rather', 'educational', 'DVDs.On', 'flip', 'side', 'camera', 'work', 'drill', 'section', 'not', 'static', 'clear', 'appropriate', 'When', 'camera', 'closeup', 'Rachel', 'abdomen', 'when', 'demonstrating', 'muscles', 'contract', 'When', 'contour', 'spine', 'showing', 'correct', 'alignment', 'yoga', 'asanas', 'videos', 'dwell', 'incorrect', 'body', 'part', 'eg', 'dancer', 'face', 'chest', 'when', 'instruction', 'focusing', 'hip', 'footwork', 'never', 'DVD.Also', 'Rachel', 'pleasant', 'strong', 'voice', 'movement', 'clearly.The', 'music', 'Pentaphobe', 'minimalistic', 'fusion', 'dark', 'electronic', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'rhythms', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'liking', 'enjoy', 'it.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'video', 'anyone', 'who', 'improve', 'isolation', 'skills', 'intend', 'using', 'DVD', 'frequently']",Tribal Fusion - Yoga Isolations & Drills for Bellydance

If you're still looking to learn more about tribal fusion and can't find a local teacher, Sera's  ""East Coast Tribal""  DVD may be the better choice.  I acquired this video because my current teacher recommended it for drills, and that's what I use it for.  In that regard, the combination of yoga and drills seem to work well, though it can be disconcerting to watch the first time through and not know whether you're supposed to already be lying on the floor or standing.  The camera work for the performance segment is almost painful to endure.  I know that Brice is a good dancer, but the choppiness of the film editing does a good job to obscure that fact.Overall, for the price, if you just want a video to help you stretch and do drills to, this will work for you.

I would definately recommend using a different yoga workout or class before attempting to jump into the poses that she does or you might injure yourself. There is no smooth transition into or out of the yoga poses and they are intermingled with standing bellydance isolations that are broken down so slowly that you barely get to see the result of the move up to speed.  And there is no choreography or combinations, really no dance instruction whatsoever. And in thaty way it is rather ungratifying because bellydance is about dancing, getting in touch with your rhythme, building confidence and balance in your space and yourself.  When you take out the dancing and just use the components of the dance, disect them and break them down into rigid contractions, you lose the spirit.  this dvd was all hard work and no feeling.This dvd is more for the experienced dancer who knows all the moves already and wants to incorporate yoga into their practice.  So don't expect to learn any new moves.There are very minimal dance moves at all- I think a total of 7 (two undulations, rib circles & drops, hip & pelvis locks) that are littered (some repeatedly, same filming segment again) between locust pose, salutaions, and some folds.the performance piece is short and very industrial sounding music that never really picks up a beat, so it is all spacey body accents to a song that is all intro.In short it was indeed challenging but certainly something you want to use as a warm-up before dancing- you aren't going to learn any Rachel Brice choreography from this one (we hope she'll do another cuz she is such a beautiful dancer).  I have been using it as a warm-up bfore practice and I have noticed an increase in my flexibility and balance.",2,it really is ONLY yoga and a few drills,1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,1855,"['First', 'all', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'pretty', 'advanced', 'yogini', 'begin', 'get', 'ample', 'benefit', 'workout', 'would', 'definately', 'recommend', 'using', 'different', 'yoga', 'workout', 'class', 'attempting', 'jump', 'poses', 'might', 'injure', 'smooth', 'transition', 'yoga', 'poses', 'are', 'intermingled', 'standing', 'bellydance', 'isolations', 'are', 'broken', 'down', 'so', 'slowly', 'barely', 'get', 'see', 'result', 'move', 'up', 'speed', 'choreography', 'combinations', 'really', 'dance', 'instruction', 'whatsoever', 'thaty', 'way', 'rather', 'ungratifying', 'bellydance', 'dancing', 'getting', 'touch', 'rhythme', 'building', 'confidence', 'balance', 'space', 'When', 'take', 'out', 'dancing', 'just', 'use', 'components', 'dance', 'disect', 'break', 'down', 'rigid', 'contractions', 'lose', 'spirit', 'dvd', 'was', 'hard', 'work', 'feeling.This', 'dvd', 'more', 'experienced', 'dancer', 'who', 'moves', 'already', 'incorporate', 'yoga', 'practice', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'learn', 'new', 'moves.There', 'are', 'very', 'minimal', 'dance', 'moves', 'all-', 'think', 'total', '7', 'two', 'undulations', 'rib', 'circles', 'drops', 'hip', 'pelvis', 'locks', 'are', 'littered', 'repeatedly', 'same', 'filming', 'segment', 'again', 'locust', 'pose', 'salutaions', 'folds.the', 'performance', 'piece', 'short', 'very', 'industrial', 'sounding', 'music', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'beat', 'spacey', 'body', 'accents', 'song', 'intro.In', 'short', 'was', 'indeed', 'challenging', 'certainly', 'something', 'want', 'use', 'warm-up', 'dancing-', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'learn', 'Rachel', 'Brice', 'choreography', 'one', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'do', 'cuz', 'such', 'beautiful', 'dancer', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'warm-up', 'bfore', 'practice', 'have', 'noticed', 'increase', 'flexibility', 'balance']",Tribal Fusion - Yoga Isolations & Drills for Bellydance
