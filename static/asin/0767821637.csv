16389,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0767821637,,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 5/05Rate: 65/05: La Bamba is a nice but okay biopic about the life of Ritchie Valens en route to becoming a teen idol pop. The movie gets somewhat monotonous at times, but it is a delight to watch because of Lou Diamond Phillips. How he plays on his guitar while singing is electrifying and sends out a very sensual energy about his character. On the other hand, his brother Bob, played by Esai Morales, wrecks the film in a large way. That's why some of the scenes appear to be redundant and pointless, contributing to the needless length to La Bamba. At times, La Bamba appears to be overdone for the use of symbolisms indicating the destiny of Ritchie Valens in a plane crash. The acting, for some of the cast members especially Esai Morales, was bit off. Portraying the problems between two problems appeared to be vague and unconvincing, rendering me lost in translation. I thought it was a smart direction to finish out the movie with Phillip's encore of La Bamba. To sum up La Bamba, the movie looked good, although there wasn't much of substance, and it worked out fine, despite the fact it was a tad too long.",3,Fair Watch.,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,1126,"['Viewed', '5/05Rate', '65/05', 'La', 'Bamba', 'nice', 'okay', 'biopic', 'life', 'Ritchie', 'Valens', 'route', 'becoming', 'teen', 'idol', 'pop', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'monotonous', 'times', 'delight', 'watch', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'How', 'guitar', 'singing', 'electrifying', 'out', 'very', 'sensual', 'energy', 'character', 'other', 'hand', 'brother', 'Bob', 'played', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'film', 'large', 'way', 'why', 'scenes', 'appear', 'be', 'redundant', 'pointless', 'contributing', 'needless', 'length', 'La', 'Bamba', 'times', 'La', 'Bamba', 'be', 'overdone', 'use', 'symbolisms', 'indicating', 'destiny', 'Ritchie', 'Valens', 'plane', 'crash', 'acting', 'cast', 'members', 'especially', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'was', 'bit', 'off', 'Portraying', 'problems', 'two', 'problems', 'appeared', 'be', 'vague', 'unconvincing', 'rendering', 'lost', 'translation', 'thought', 'was', 'smart', 'direction', 'finish', 'out', 'movie', 'Phillip', 'encore', 'La', 'Bamba', 'sum', 'up', 'La', 'Bamba', 'movie', 'looked', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'substance', 'worked', 'out', 'fine', 'fact', 'was', 'tad', 'too', 'long']",N/A

And plus we get some more out of this story then the buddy Holly Story, okay we know that Ritchie Valens was another one of the singers that lost his life in the plane crash on the morning of Febuary 3rd, but how much else do we know about him, since his carrier was only 8 months long? La Bamba opens with some boys playing basketball in a school yard, and in the sky are 2 plans, that crash, and guess where they fall. Yep, that is rgith to the schoolyard below, we later learn that one of Ritchie Valens' best friends was killed on this day, and that we are too believe that this is his memory. We also learn that he was not present that day, and he believes that if he was, he would have been killed by one of the falling planes. Hence, why he didn't like to fly. Ritchie Valens (Lou Diamond Phillips) grows as a poor boy out in the middle of Calfiorna, he lives with his Mom Connie Valenzuela (Rosana De Soto) , and one day when working out in the fields he sees his troubled half brother Bob Morales (Esai Morales) coming out hsi motorcycle, and goes off a ride. And then find Connie, and they also introuce a freind of his mom name Rosie (Elizabeth Pena) to Bob. They movie out, and into a trailer, and 3 months later Connie leaves for her job as a waitress. And he heads off to school, where a new girl named Donna (Danielle von Zerneck) is new to town, and to the school, and is in one of his classes with Ritchie. The rest you should get of his beginning of his carrier, where he treys out for a garbage band, makes it, but at the first gig the lead singer (Geoffrey Rivas) doesn't even let him sing, which leads Ritchie to tour around town solo, and envtelally with the band minus the lead singer, when then he is spoted by the man that would be become his manger and his name is Bob Keene (Joe Pantoliano), which leads to his school days being over, and Ritchie still dating Donna, even if her parents, weel at least her father doesn't approve of Ritchie and the music that he plays.",4,And now Ritchie Vaelns' life story,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,2269,"['First', 'had', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Story', 'now', 'have', 'La', 'Bamba', 'Ritichie', 'Valens', 'own', 'life', 'story', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Story', 'had', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'doing', 'own', 'singing', 'movie', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Philips', ""n't"", 'do', 'own', 'singing', 'instead', 'band', 'named', 'Los', 'Lobos', 'get', 'more', 'story', 'then', 'buddy', 'Holly', 'Story', 'know', 'Ritchie', 'Valens', 'was', 'one', 'singers', 'lost', 'life', 'plane', 'crash', 'morning', 'Febuary', '3rd', 'how', 'much', 'else', 'do', 'know', 'carrier', 'was', 'only', '8', 'months', 'long', 'La', 'Bamba', 'boys', 'playing', 'basketball', 'school', 'yard', 'sky', 'are', '2', 'plans', 'crash', 'guess', 'where', 'fall', 'Yep', 'rgith', 'schoolyard', 'later', 'learn', 'one', 'Ritchie', 'Valens', 'best', 'friends', 'was', 'killed', 'day', 'are', 'too', 'believe', 'memory', 'also', 'learn', 'was', 'not', 'present', 'day', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'one', 'falling', 'planes', 'Hence', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'fly', 'Ritchie', 'Valens', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'poor', 'boy', 'middle', 'Calfiorna', 'Mom', 'Connie', 'Valenzuela', 'Rosana', 'De', 'Soto', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'working', 'out', 'fields', 'troubled', 'half', 'brother', 'Bob', 'Morales', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'coming', 'out', 'hsi', 'motorcycle', 'off', 'ride', 'then', 'find', 'Connie', 'also', 'introuce', 'freind', 'mom', 'name', 'Rosie', 'Elizabeth', 'Pena', 'Bob', 'movie', 'trailer', '3', 'months', 'later', 'Connie', 'job', 'waitress', 'school', 'where', 'new', 'girl', 'named', 'Donna', 'Danielle', 'von', 'Zerneck', 'new', 'town', 'school', 'one', 'classes', 'Ritchie', 'rest', 'should', 'get', 'beginning', 'carrier', 'where', 'out', 'garbage', 'band', 'first', 'lead', 'singer', 'Geoffrey', 'Rivas', ""n't"", 'even', 'let', 'sing', 'Ritchie', 'tour', 'around', 'town', 'solo', 'envtelally', 'band', 'lead', 'singer', 'when', 'then', 'spoted', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'become', 'manger', 'name', 'Bob', 'Keene', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'school', 'days', 'being', 'Ritchie', 'still', 'dating', 'Donna', 'even', 'parents', 'weel', 'least', 'father', ""n't"", 'approve', 'Ritchie', 'music']",N/A

16398,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0767821637,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","La Bamba, 1987 filmThis is the Hollywood history of Ritchie Valens, a young man who had hit songs in the late 1950s. Music did not require a large investment, only talent (as Elvis might have said). We see Ricky's  life at home and in his poor neighborhood. [Was this story modified to make it seem better?] The 1950s saw the end of the depression and the beginning of prosperity for most people. A talent agent meets Ricky Valenzuela and signs him to a contract. We hear him sing a slow ballad. Later he is offered a contract by ""Delphi Records"". We see Ricky recording in a studio, doing many ""takes"", practicing to get it right. There is a lot of drudgery. He is given a new name ""Ritchie Valens"" (more marketable?). A local AM radio station promotes his records. Will his friendship with Donna continue? [""Donna"" is Spanish for ""Lady"", not necessarily a particular woman.]Donna doesn't like show business. Ritchie composes a song for Donna. His older brother takes him to Tijuana for a pleasurable weekend. Who to choose? ""Take two."" He hears the song ""La Bamba"" (a wedding song). He visits a local folk healer who gives him a charm to allay his fears. Ritchie sings ""Donna"", a big hit for him (about disappointment in love). Can he sing ""La Bamba"" as a rock and roll song? In Spanish? Ritchie doesn't like to fly - we see a DC-3 taking him to Philadelphia. ""American Bandstand"" was a must see TV show in the summer of 1957, Ritchie sings ""Donna"" (to sell records to teens who have money for this). This brings him fame among the teenagers of America. They want his autograph! Ritchie buys a new convertible (the ""cool"" car then). He buys a new home for his Mom (a dutiful son). It even has a guest house! Alan Freed has a big show. Eddie Cochrane sings his big hit song ""Summertime Blues"" (still relevant today?).Ritchie sings ""La Bamba"" for another hit song. (How many rock and roll songs in Spanish?) It has an emotional appeal to many, even those who don't know the language. His older brother Bob is jealous of his success and resents him. [For drama in this movie? But talent, like fortune, is not  shared equally. We learn why there is a problem between them. [It couldn't be based on their personalities?] We see Buddy Holly singing one of his many hit songs. Their bus has broken down, no heat in a very cold winter. Ritchie call home and talks to Bob (he is lonesome). A chartered airplane is hired to take the headliners to their destination. A flipped coin decides who goes. The small Beechcraft airplane takes off. Later a radio brings a bulletin about a fatal crash. ""The day the music died"" said someone. His career lasted only eight months; he was still in high school. [Many performers have died in car crashes.]Buddy Holly was the big star; they made a movie about his life. J.P. Richardson was a disc jockey who had a hit song. A year later Eddie Cochrane died when his limo skidded into a lamp post (no seat belts in those days). Will they ever make a movie about Eddie Cochrane (he wrote ""20 Flight Rock)? In 1957 Dick Clark became famous for running ""American Bandstand"" (he replaced another who was fired over a scandal). Dick Clark went on to have a longer career than Ed Sullivan. You only have to introduce talent, not have it. Before rock and roll three record companies controlled 90% of the business. The popularity of rock and roll allowed many small companies to enter the record business so 30 companies controlled 90% of sales. This reduced the value of their stock and led to a Congressional investigation [as I remember it].

Lou Diamond Phillips gives a wonderful performance of a the singer who turned a new generation onto the influential Chicano rock music that inspired other Tex-Mex rock artists such as Los Lobos who preformed the title song, Santana, Los Lonely Boys and countless others.  He was successful at a time when there were very few Latinos in the American Rock/Pop scene...  He is considered the first Latino ever to successfully crossover into Rock mainstream.Ritchies' musical talents were encouraged by his mother and brother, although his brother would become envious and jealous as he rose to fame.  Rosana De Soto plays his loving mother who is supportive of her sons' musical aspirations.  His older brother, Bob was a malicious ex-con, who loved his brother but he was jealous of the attention his mother gave to him.  Esai Morales gives a very good performance as his unhappy, alcoholic brother who grows extremely bitter as Ritchie rises to stardom.The soundtrack also includes songs sung by Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, and Jackie Wilson.  If you enjoy late 50's movies, you will like this movie that is suitable for the entire family.  I'd like to see a remake where they include a music CD of all the songs he made popular during his short eight-month career.4  STARS",4,A Rock and Roll Pioneer,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,1381,"['Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'legendary', '1950s', 'rock', 'roll', 'pioneer', 'Ritchie', 'Valens', 'musical', 'biopic', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'singer', 'who', 'turned', 'new', 'generation', 'influential', 'Chicano', 'rock', 'music', 'inspired', 'other', 'Tex-Mex', 'rock', 'artists', 'such', 'Los', 'Lobos', 'who', 'preformed', 'title', 'song', 'Santana', 'Los', 'Lonely', 'Boys', 'countless', 'others', 'was', 'successful', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'Latinos', 'American', 'Rock/Pop', 'scene', 'considered', 'first', 'Latino', 'ever', 'successfully', 'crossover', 'Rock', 'mainstream.Ritchies', 'musical', 'talents', 'were', 'encouraged', 'mother', 'brother', 'brother', 'would', 'become', 'envious', 'jealous', 'rose', 'fame', 'Rosana', 'De', 'Soto', 'loving', 'mother', 'who', 'supportive', 'sons', 'musical', 'aspirations', 'older', 'brother', 'Bob', 'was', 'malicious', 'ex-con', 'who', 'loved', 'brother', 'was', 'jealous', 'attention', 'mother', 'gave', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'unhappy', 'alcoholic', 'brother', 'who', 'extremely', 'bitter', 'Ritchie', 'stardom.The', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'songs', 'sung', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Eddie', 'Cochran', 'Jackie', 'Wilson', 'enjoy', 'late', '50', 'movies', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'suitable', 'entire', 'family', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'remake', 'where', 'include', 'music', 'CD', 'songs', 'made', 'popular', 'short', 'eight-month', 'career.4', 'STARS']",N/A

Maybe it's just the fact that it is so real, based on a true story, on a real person's life... and a real person's tragedy.The film is a journey through all possible emotions - right from the hope, then the dream that has come true, and to the end of it all. Which is, when one considers it, maybe not purely tragic. 'Cause like the ancient Greeks believed: There is no greater happiness than to die when you are most happy.It is left unsaid how much of La Bamba that is actually not based on real happenings. But the makers of the film have, unlike so many others who base films on 'true' stories, succeeded in eliminating the less-credible details, and they have made everything seem very real and very relevant.A heartfelt, warm, and cathing film.

Lou Diamond Phillips was awesome as the young musician and Los Lobos was equally terrific providing the music of the legend. I have no idea how much of this movie was really accurate since Hollywood takes numerous liberties when they make a movie ""based on a true story."" I've learned that that is very loose terminology when they say ""based on a true story or on actual events"" but in any case, it does make for a good film, though it is heartbreaking indeed. People probably think of Buddy Holly first when they hear the phrase ""The Day The Music Died"" but that plane crash also took the lives of 3 other people including The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens. Compared to other rock and roll biopics, this one rates right up there. ""La Bamba"" and ""Walk The Line"" rank pretty high as opposed to ""Great Balls Of Fire"" which was pretty dreadful.

16410,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,0767821637,Dave. K,"[8, 8]","La Bamba is my favorite movie of all time hands down. Of all the films I have seen not many reached me the way La Bamba did. I first saw this movie back in the summer of 96 when I was 17-years old and I fell in love with this movie and also became a big fan of Ritchie Valens. No joke I would watch this movie every single day it was on. La Bamba was a staple part of HBO's line up and even if it was on twice a day I would watch it. For me, each time I saw the movie it felt like the first time. I would drive my friends crazy with having to watch it even after I recorded the movie they figured I wouldn't watch it as much, but I still did.At the time I was actually learning the guitar and I never really played at all and this movie inspired me to actually practice and not only that, but it also inspired me on wanting to be a filmmaker. I really can't think of any other movie that reached me on this deep of a level. Like I said in the opening of my review La Bamba is hands down my favorite movie of all time. For starters it has some truly great music; La Bamba is about having a dream and not letting anyone stop you from reaching that dream. It's about love and family.The screenplay by Luis Valdez was excellent; the characters are great and each of the main players all add to the movie. None of the characters are just there. Each character plays a crucial part of the movie. While yes the story does revolve around Ritchie played amazingly by Lou Diamond Phillips, but in many ways movie is actually Bob's story played by Esai Morales who pretty much steals the show. There is a bond between the 2 brothers, but there is also tension. Bob is always in Ritchie's shadow despite being older and I was really able to relate more to Bob in many ways than Ritchie. Ritchie was sort of the Golden Boy, while Bob was sort of the outsider.I think at some point in our lives we have felt like we were in someone's shadow, either it be a friend, family member or co-worker. The more Ritchie finds success the more Bob falls into this despair as all the attention goes to Ritchie and he's sort of forgotten about. The movie may revolve around Ritchie, but it's very much Bob's story. And Esai Morales gives a terrific performance. La Bamba is about going for your dreams and not letting anyone stop you from reaching them. We all have dreams in life and most of us are too afraid to try and make them come true. Ritchie had a dream in life and wouldn't let anything keep him from that and I hold that close. La Bamba gave me and still gives me the courage to go after my own filmmaking dreams.As director Luis Valdez creates some truly touching scenes and some truly inspiring moments. When making a Bio-picture normally certain parts are played up more for dramatic effect and Valdez does that here, but it works well. A lot of the scenes with tension between Bob and Ritchie comes from real life and comes from the own personal experience between Luis Valdez and his own brother. The love story between Ritchie and Donna played by Danielle von Zerneck are possibly the strongest scenes of the movie and shows a time of innocence.Prior to this movie I knew who Ritchie Valens was and I knew his music, but I wouldn't be able to place the music with the artist. All the music in the movie that Ritchie sings is performed by Los Lobos who did justice to the original music, but I sought out the original versions by Ritchie and loved it. On my guitar I used to play Donna, Come on Let's Go and La Bamba non-stop. Nothing can top the opening lick in La Bamba.Lou Diamond Phillips made his screen debut, but if not mistaken he actually shot Stand and Deliver first, but this one came out first. Lou Diamond gives a performance of a lifetime. His performance is so real and inspiring. I would rate this performance as one of my all time favorites. By the time I saw La Bamba I was already a fan of Lou Diamond, but this movie made him one of my very favorite actors of all time. Esai Morales though pretty much steals the show like I stated before. Rosanna DeSoto as Connie, Ritchie's mother is excellent and Joey Pantoliano as Ritchie's manager is excellent, but Joey Pants always delivers. Elizabeth Pena also gives a good performance as Ritchie's ex-girlfriend who is now with Bob, which creates some uneasy tension.I'll be the first to admit the final act always gets me teary-eyed. The death of Ritchie and Buddy Holly and The Big Bopper was so tragic. Buddy Holly is one of my all time favorite musicians. When Ritchie's family and friends hear the news over the radio it's just so tragic. Sleepwalk, played by Santo & Johnny is so hauntingly beautiful and really adds to the scene; Bob walking across a wooded bridge and stops and screams Ritchie's name never fails to give me the chills.La Bamba is truly a great and uplifting movie that is really tragic, but again very uplifting. Ritchie was only 17-years old when he died and I remember being freaked out since I was that very age when I first saw the movie. At that age death isn't something we think about and it was quite creepy. This may be clich&eacute;d, but Ritchie may be gone, but his music and impact will never be forgotten. His life inspired this movie and this movie inspired me.Without a doubt La Bamba is my very favorite movie nothing for me comes close. I can watch this movie everyday and never once get tired of it. Each time I see the movie it feels like the first time.",5,My favorite movie of all time,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,5451,"['La', 'Bamba', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'down', 'films', 'have',

16411,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,0767821637,Deborah Earle,"[2, 2]","The haunting strains of ""Sleepwalk"" by Santo and Johnny (a song which, in actuality was introduced the summer after this story ends) begin the tale of Ritchie Valens(played by a winsome and determined Lou Diamond Phillips), and the complimentary recreation of the teen rocker's legendary score by Los Lobos sets  director Luis Valdez's presentation on fire.Jolted out of bed after yet another  bad dream of a real-life incident in which a section of one of two colliding planes fell and killed his friend as he was on a playground, a recoiling young Ricardo Valenzuela begins his day, helping his family pick produce in an orchard (although there is apparent dispute about his ever having had that occupation) in the Northern California of 1957.Shortly thereafter, the hardworking teen and his family, including his mother, Connie(Rosanna De Soto) and his sisters (Katie Valdez  and Gloria Balcorta) are reunited with the bad seed of the family, Bob (Esai Morales), newly released from jail.The relationship of the two half-brothers is raucously playful. But the marked differences between their two personalities will determine their destinies.Ritchie, polite, respectful, and determined to be a successful rock and roll star, plays his guitar at every opportunity( including his sister's birthday party) and stays focused on his goal.Bob, on the other hand,hot-headed, and alcoholic, seduces young Rosie Morales(Elizabeth Pena), who goes with the Valenzuelas when they move to a new residence. The two have a very tempestuous relationship that cannot be described as an honorable one.We observe the support of Ritchie's family as his mother arranges for him to perform in the bar where his father drank himself to death, and he plays at school dances. Even Bob backs him on the drums at one point.After performing with a group called The Silhouettes for a time, a talent scout decides that Ritchie is the member of that group who has the real talent. Soon, Bob Keane( Joe Pantoliano) begins to manage his career, which begins to take off.In the meantime, Ritchie courts a lovely car dealer's daughter named Donna Ludwig (Danielle Von Zerneck) whose father( Sam Anderson) being a product of his time, disapproves of their relationship, although her mother(Maggie Gwinn)seems slightly more empathetic.An undercurrent to the story takes place when Bob, working as a garbage man takes home some cartoon cells that were discarded outside an animation studio, and gradually discovers his own talent as an artist. But Ritchie's success roars louder as time goes on, and Bob's resentment of his younger brother's accomplishments grows.Ritchie's first recording for the Del-Fi Label is ""Come on, Let's Go"", and he reluctantly allows his name to be changed to Ritchie Valens to broaden the appeal he will have as star.The rising young recording star does a radio segment with Alan Freed(Jeffrey Alan Chandler)where he is the topic of a trivia question, and personally delivers pizza to the winning contestant.He is able to buy his mother a new house, and her unbridled delight is a dagger in the heart of his less-successful older brother.Donna, however, seems to be slipping away from his grasp, and her father denies she is home whenever Ritchie calls, much to Donna's own aggravation.After confronting her at her home, Ritchie writes a song to prove his feelings about her, and sings it to her over a pay phone. Riding by on his motorcycle, Bob tries to get Ritchie to forget Donna by taking him to Tiajuana, where they end up in a brothel. While Bob displays the interests typical of men in such an environment, Ritchie is drawn to the music played by the band(Los Lobos in their cameo appearance), particularly, the song, ""La Bamba"".Finding himself in unfamiliar surroundings when waking the following morning, he is greeted by an old mystic faith healer(Mike Moroff)who gives him and Bob a breakfast of rattlesnake and hands Ritchie a talisman, which he claims will help with his fear of flying.Rosie delivers Bob's daughter while the two are away, and the next morning Connie gives her sons both barrels for their irresponsibility in not being there for Rosie in her time of need.After performing ""Donna"" on ""American Bandstand"", Ritchie, however incorporates the lessons he gleaned from his South of the boarder stint into his work. Bob Keane reluctantly allows Ritchie to record the Mexican folk song he heard. Christmastime of 1958 finds Ritchie waiting to appear onstage in New York, where audiences are treated to performances of such now-legendary luminaries as Eddie Cochran(Brian Setzer)who would later write the song ""Three Stars"" honoring Ritchie and two others, the same year he was fated to become a fourth star in the sky, and Jackie Wilson( Howard Huntsberry) before Ritchie dazzles them with ""La Bamba""--a moment that becomes the highlight of his career.Returning home afterwards, Ritchie and his brother have a final and bitter confrontation during the Christmas party given to welcome Ritchie home.While empathetic to Bob's situation, one feels that the least he could do is put aside his personal issues and be supportive of the family member who was doing the most to help his family rise from poverty. But Bob does not easily concede to any personal accountability for his actions.There is one more romantic moment with his girl before Ritchie must leave for that fateful Winter Dance Tour, and there is a reconciliation with Bob during a phone conversation. At only 17, his future seems assured.But as was noted in the tagline advertising this film:""Talent made him a star...Fate made him a legend.""The end of a supernova career is spent in the company of Buddy Holly(Marshall Crenshaw) and the Big Bopper(Stephen Lee), both of whom are expectant fathers.Mrs. Valenzuela learns of the tragic change in her family's fortune by radio, and Donna from her sobbing classmates.Rick Dees, as journalist Ted Quillan, covers the final chapter in this story.The real Mrs. Valenzuela, who lived just long enough to see her son's story appear onscreen, makes a cameo appearance during a family gathering.As nostaligia buffs and others await the arrival of the impending film on the Big Bopper's life, the final segment of the ""Three Stars"" trilogy, this riveting tale brings home the lesson of how a young star's life still continues to inspire, and how the joy in his music will live forever.",5,The Youngest of the Three Fallen Stars,1287014400,"10 14,

Gone forever were three stars who just tasted success and were bound for only more.But good for all of us we have Hollywood and the radio to remind us how good it was. In the golden age of rock, a 17 year old with a beat up amp and guitar took the country by storm with three hit songs. From humble beginnings, to finding love, then being discovered, up until his unfortunate departure...the life of Ritchie Valens was short but memorable.Lou Diamond Phillips shines as young Ritchie with dreams of ""Pure Rock 'n Roll"". Like Ritchie, Phillips shines in his first major role. Esai Morales displays his talents as the unstable Bob; a true character that Morales passionately brings to life. Morales and especially Rosanna DeSoto should receive special claim. For playing Connie Valenzuela, DeSoto had to become the rock that held the Valenzuela family together. Wonderful acting all around by the supporting cast brings this period to life.This special edition of La Bamba features a special commentary option with the Director of the movie, Mr. Luis Valdez, Phillips, and Morales.

He gives a multi-faceted, many layered performance full of nuances that left me wanting to see him as other characters.

Director Luis Valdez correctly fused the major parts of Valens' life with some of the songs that rocketed Valens to the top.  Lou Diamond Phillips has a breakway role as Ritchie Valens and plays him with just the right note of self-assured talent and the conviction that his talent will not be stopped by the racism that was then rampant in the music business. We see Ritchie Valenzuela trying to balance a musical career that will not tolerate Mexican-Americans with his equally strong grasp for the love of a blue-eyed blonde Donna, neither of which will be easy to achieve.  Valenzuela learns painfully that no singer with a Latin name can hope to hit the top ten.  He compromises by choosing an Anglofied version--Valens.  But with Donna there can be no compromise.  His breakout hit ""Donna"" is his clarion call that there are some principles that he refuses to give in on.  Valens even learns to trust his instinct that tells him that a Spanish language song will be a bestseller.  Hence, the ""La Bamba"" of the title, which is played by the real life Les Lobos during a footstomping jam session.  Esai Morales as his weaker brother Bob pushes the film into soap opera territory, yet even here, Phillips as Valens keeps his feet and his voice solidly grounded in the basic business of the film.  I had a bigger problem with the airplane crashing foreshadowing that intruded far too often.  Valens' dreams of his own death in a plane crash gave the film an overheavy dose of inevitability.  During the last night of his life, Valens shares center stage with the Big Bopper and Buddy Holly, both of whom add their own verbal luminescence to the singing light that was extinguished far too soon.  LA BAMBA is a musical paen to those fortunate few who possess the ability to shake us out of our chairs and deposit us on dancing in the aisles.

Of the many tragedies in the history of rock, there are few more bitterly poignant than that of Ritchie Valens, and director Luis Valdez makes us feel the full force of the tragedy. He makes us love not only Ritchie (Lou Diamond Phillips) but also his supportive mother Connie (Rosana De Soto) and his troubled brother Bob (Esai Morales), then ends the film as he should, on a note of raw, unmitigated grief. On the way to the tragic end, however, we also get marvelous recreations of vintage rock songs by Los Lobos, Brian Setzer, Marshall Crenshaw, Howard Huntsberry and others. Seeing La Bamba again brings up a smaller tragedy: why Phillips, Morales and De Soto didn't become bigger stars, as they clearly deserved to become from their performances in this movie. Only Phillips came at all close to stardom, and for every step forward he took--his change-of-pace villainous role in Courage Under Fire, his Broadway triumph in the revival of The King and I--he took two steps back with some straight-to-video flick.

Lou Diamond Philips plays Ritchie and he gives a solid performance.  The real star of the film is Esai Morales who gives an explosive performance as Ritchie's brother Bob.  While Ritchie seems to have it all, big talent, a beautiful girlfriend and the love of his mother, Bob is the opposite.  Shiftless, with no sense of direction, Bob becomes jealous of Ritchie and his anger is palpable.  While Ritchie is riding high, he faces the pressure of being Latino in the lily-white 50's.  His girlfriend is white and her father forbids her to see him which helped produce Valens' lone top ten hit &quot;Donna&quot;.  The ubiquitous Joe Pantiliano shows up as the producer who signs and records Valens and rockers Brian Setzer and Marshall Crenshaw play Eddie Cochran and Buddy Holly respectively.

The features show clips of Ritchie's family during the making of the film.Many of them made cameo appearances and the audio commentary mentions them when they appear.What also is interesting is Ritchie's girlfriend Donna. She does appear in the extra footage. This contradicts the previous reviewers comment that he didn't have a girlfriend named Donna. He did, though the film makes it clear that there were problems. If you listen to the audio commentary you'll discover that Donna's parents later divorced, partly because of her father's racism.Ritchie's brother Bob also appears in the extra footage and he's rather blunt and honest as he recalls himself during that time period which is wonderful. Bob really was like that at that time. What's really nice to know is that he eventually cleaned himself up and became a drug & alcohol counselor. (Though that was sometime after Ritchie's death)So, if you haven't seen the film, buy this DVD. If you already have a copy of it, this version of the film with the extra stuff makes buying this version deffinately worthwhile.",5,Charming,1314403200,"08 27, 2011",2011,1220,"['must', 'admit', 'was', 'charmed', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'seen', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'DVD', 'really', 'did', 'me.Why', 'extra', 'features', 'features', 'show', 'clips', 'Ritchie', 'family', 'making', 'film.Many', 'made', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'audio', 'commentary', 'mentions', 'when', 'appear.What', 'also', 'interesting', 'Ritchie', 'girlfriend', 'Donna', 'appear', 'extra', 'footage', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'comment', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'girlfriend', 'named', 'Donna', 'did', 'film', 'clear', 'were', 'problems', 'listen', 'audio', 'commentary', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'Donna', 'parents', 'later', 'divorced', 'partly', 'father', 'racism.Ritchie', 'brother', 'Bob', 'also', 'extra', 'footage', 'rather', 'blunt', 'honest', 'time', 'period', 'wonderful', 'Bob', 'really', 'was', 'time', 'What', 'really', 'nice', 'know', 'eventually', 'cleaned', 'up', 'became', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'counselor', 'was', 'sometime', 'Ritchie', 'death', 'So', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'buy', 'DVD', 'already', 'have', 'copy', 'version', 'film', 'extra', 'stuff', 'buying', 'version', 'deffinately', 'worthwhile']",N/A

But the ending -- who was the unnamed guy that the coin was tossed with and Valens won -- and boarded the plane?  4 guys have said it was them -- Waylon Jennings, Dion, and two others.Also, go to youtube.com to see what ""Donna"" (Ritchie's girlfriend) looks like today.

16442,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0767821637,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","&#34;La Bamba&#34; is a really good rags-to-almost-riches story about Ritchie Valens who was three months shy of 18 years-old the day the music died on February 3, 1959. Ritchie is played by Lou Diamond Phillips, his brother Bob by Esai Morales, his mother by Rosanna DeSoto and their friend, Rosie, by Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a. Other than Ritchie's unlikely quick rise to fame, the story focuses on his troubled brother, who both supports Ritchie and resents his success, as well as Ritchie's youthful infatuation with a blond gringo who inspired the hit &#34;Donna&#34; (Danielle von Zerneck). Donna's Dad, of course, is a bigot and doesn't want her seeing a lowly Hispanic. Ritchie needed a connection to stardom and that was smalltime record producer Bob Keane (Joe Pantoliano) who witnesses Ritchie's magic at a Saturday matin&eacute;e show at a movie theater.&#34;La Bamba&#34; is just an all-around entertaining movie. It's got a good (true) story, great music from that era, authentic California locations and quality actors. Morales stands out as Ritchie's brother who's essentially a &#34;dark Fonz&#34; character. I also like how Keane is shown to be a do-it-yourself visionary who's &#34;studio&#34; is in his basement. Keane had a make-a-way-where-there-is-no-way ethic, an eye for talent and a willingness to look for treasure in &#34;nobodies&#34;; and that's why he was successful and is remembered to this day. This is just one example of the gems that can be gleaned from the proceedings.The film runs 108 minutes.GRADE: B+ or A-",5,"Too young to die, but not to rock 'n' roll",1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,1544,"['34', 'La', 'Bamba', '34', 'really', 'good', 'rags-to-almost-riches', 'story', 'Ritchie', 'Valens', 'who', 'was', 'three', 'months', 'shy', '18', 'years-old', 'day', 'music', 'died', 'February', '3', '1959', 'Ritchie', 'played', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'brother', 'Bob', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'mother', 'Rosanna', 'DeSoto', 'friend', 'Rosie', 'Elizabeth', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'Other', 'Ritchie', 'unlikely', 'quick', 'rise', 'fame', 'story', 'troubled', 'brother', 'who', 'supports', 'Ritchie', 'success', 'as', 'well', 'Ritchie', 'youthful', 'infatuation', 'blond', 'gringo', 'who', 'inspired', 'hit', '34', 'Donna', '34', 'Danielle', 'von', 'Zerneck', 'Donna', 'Dad', 'course', 'bigot', ""n't"", 'want', 'seeing', 'lowly', 'Hispanic', 'Ritchie', 'needed', 'connection', 'stardom', 'was', 'smalltime', 'record', 'producer', 'Bob', 'Keane', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'who', 'Ritchie', 'magic', 'Saturday', 'matin', 'eacute', 'show', 'movie', 'theater.', '34', 'La', 'Bamba', '34', 'just', 'all-around', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'got', 'good', 'true', 'story', 'great', 'music', 'era', 'authentic', 'California', 'locations', 'quality', 'actors', 'Morales', 'out', 'Ritchie', 'brother', 'who', 'essentially', '34', 'dark', 'Fonz', '34', 'character', 'also', 'how', 'Keane', 'shown', 'be', 'do-it-yourself', 'visionary', 'who', '34', 'studio', '34', 'basement', 'Keane', 'had', 'make-a-way-where-there-is-no-way', 'ethic', 'eye', 'talent', 'willingness', 'look', 'treasure', '34', 'nobodies', '34', 'why', 'was', 'successful', 'remembered', 'day', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'gems', 'can', 'be', 'gleaned', 'proceedings.The', 'film', '108', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B+', 'A-']",N/A
