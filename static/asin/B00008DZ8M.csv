740444,AA7W0CFRXF46L,B00008DZ8M,elfdart,"[3, 5]","... i dislike when people review the quality of something rather than the content itself. i won't get into marshal mcluhan with... i just won't. but i guess note that the reviews are positive, people are just mad about how it's presented (honestly, how will reviewing that do anything).this is a great series. i have watched and enjoyed anne of green gables before and was prepared for the world i was walking into, but i enjoyed it anew, as if walking into it for the first time. it's basically about a girl who gets sent off to live with her deceased mother's family for some time because her father is in some legal trouble. it's a fantastic period piece. to my knowledge the setting and costumes are spot on... but the sentiments of the time are also present, which is really refreshing. i mean i respect the fact that the present day takes pride in political correctness, but back in the day, women couldn't vote, a lot was placed on religion... and it's nice to see that history wasn't changed for the sake of present ideals.at times the acting was somewhat contrived, but overall i'd say the actors did a great job. and where the actors didn't quite do it for for, the characters and plot stepped in and changed my mind. the characters are really compelling. they all have a story to tell, they all have fire and spunk, even the quiet ones or the ones who barely make their presence known. i really wanted to know more about all of the characters in the show because you could sense that they all had a story to tell. the main characters had very strong personalities. sarah is very proud and stubborn and little to nothing will get in her way enough to stop the course of action she's chosen... but at the same time she's reserved and thoughtful. aunt hetty (spelling?) is also very stubborn and strong (.. pretty much all of the women in this series has a strong voice, the plot is moved by them collectively). she doesn't like showing emotion and is at odds with several people because of the wrongs she perceives they have committed against her. she's very set in her ways. olivia is very whimsical and counteracts hetty's tough exterior. i won't go into all of the characters because there are a lot, but the two who aren't in the immediate family i'd like to mention would be felicity and peg bowen. felicity is sarah's cousin and is very spiteful and petty, but at the same time, when she's nice you can feel the force of her character utilized in a positive way and are grateful for it. she's an interesting character because you sometimes can't decide whether you should like her or hate her. and peg bowen is the town 'witch'. i really enjoyed this character because she's outside the norm and can be the voice of reason, i thought she was really strong.the episodes are basically events that open up the community a bit in some way or another, and sarah's always the cause. it's kind of like that movie polyanna in that respect, but much more multi-faceted.this series isn't half as well known as it should be, it's really well done.",5,great series!,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,3051,"['i',

Not that that's a bad thing or anything. In fact, I enjoyed the first season of ""The Road to Avonlea"" as much as I enjoyed the ""Anne"" series.Kevin Sullivan's productions are always a pleasure to watch. The attention to detail, with respect to costumes, settings and the ways of the people, is astounding. It is rare to see this much effort put into the making of a TV series. Give or take the odd bad episode (and these are few and far between), the scripts are well written and enjoyable (particularly any episode featuring Marilla Cuthbert and Rachel Linde) and most of the actors are very well cast. The only thing I didn't like about it was Jackie Burroughs as Hetty King. I just felt that she was too old for the part.

740449,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00008DZ8M,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[11, 13]","In the year 1903 after her father is charged with embezzlement, young Sara Stanley (Sarah Polley) is sent from Montreal to live with her late mother's relatives in the town of Avonlea on Prince Edward Island.  Sara ends up in the care of her Aunt Hetty King (Jackie Burroughs), the matriarch of the King clan and the teacher at the Avonlea school.  The transition from high society in Montreal to the simple life on P.E.I. proves difficult for Sara, who has to endure the taunts of her cousins, the vain Felicity (Gema Zamprogna) and the mischievous Felix (Zachary Bennett).  Fortunately her Aunt Olivia (Mag Ruffman) is a kindly soul and Sara makes friends with Jasper Dale (R.H. Thompson), the local recluse who helps her put on the magic lantern show that earns Sara the sobriquet of ""The Story Girl.""""Road to Avonlea"" was based on not only the two L.M. Montgomery novels that featured Sara and her King cousins, ""The Story Girl"" and ""The Golden Road,"" but two collections of short stories, ""Chronicles of Avonlea"" and ""Further Chronicles of Avonlea."" Seven of the eleven episodes were based specifically on Montgomery's writings, albeit often with significant changes in the characters to fit the show's cast: ""The Quarrantine at Alexander Abraham's,"" ""Old Lady Lloyd,"" and ""Aunt Abigail's Beau"" come from ""Chronicles of Avonlea,"" ""The Materialization of Duncan"" from ""Further Chronicles,"" and ""Proof of the Pudding,"" ""Conversions,"" and ""The Hope Chest of Arabella King"" are all from chapters in ""The Story Girl.""  Three of those adaptations were written by Heather Conkie, who would continue to do an excellent job of turning Montgomery's story into episodes in the future.  These stories also allowed the show to work in a couple of beloved characters from the Sullivan ""Anne of Green Gables"" productions, with Colleen Dewhurst as Marilla Cuthebert and Patricia Hamilton as Mrs. Rachel Lynde.When I watched ""The Complete First Season"" of ""Road to Avonlea"" again, I was struck by how much I do not like Hetty King.  I swear, that when we get to the final episode, ""Nothing Endures But Change,"" and Hetty is upset that Sara's father wants to take her home (which is not a radical thing for a father to want to do), I have no idea why either she or Sara want to continue to put up with each other.  I think it is clear that Hetty hates Sara's father, blaming him for the death of her sister Ruth, more than she likes Sara.  In fact, this episode is really the first sign of any affection from Hetty towards Sara in the series.  In previous episodes Hetty terrorizes Felix at school, treats Olivia like a child, and refuses to listen to anything her brother Alex (Cedric Smith) has to say, and he is the most level headed person on the show (with the possible exception of Peg Bowen).  Hetty King is certainly opinionated and if she was right more often it might not be such a burden to put up with her domineering ways.During the first season Sara Stanley is pretty much at the center of everything, and if Sarah Polley was not the Dakota Fanning of her day she certainly holds her own in comparison to Jodi Foster.  The continuing clashes between Sara and Felicity are part of the fun, coming to a head the following season with ""A Mother's Love,"" and it is impossible to watch these early episodes again and not be aware that hired boy Peter Craig, who was destined to be the haughty Felicity's husband according to Montgomery's novels, will be replaced by Gus Pike and that their romance will become a mainstay of the series.  For that matter, you can also watch the initial sparks between Olivia and Jasper that will also become a major plotline in the future.This Canadian series aired south of the border as ""Avonlea"" on the Disney Channel, to which I subscribed simply to watch these episodes (I honeymooned on PEI at the ""White Sands Hotel,"" so obvious I am a big fan of Montgomery and ""Anne of Green Gables).  There are some slight problems with the video transfer to DVD that becomes a bit bothersome at times (my totally inexact and unscientific description would be that it is as if the pixels were squares instead of octagons or whatever they are).  Hopefully there will be some digital remastering of these episodes in the future so that this complaint can be put aside and our enjoyment of ""Road to Avonlea"" can be complete.",5,"Sara Stanley, the Story Girl, spends her first season in Avonlea",1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,4342,"['year', '1903', 'father', 'charged', 'embezzlement', 'young', 'Sara', 'Stanley', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'sent', 'Montreal', 'live', 'late', 'mother', 'relatives', 'town', 'Avonlea', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'Sara', 'up', 'care', 'Aunt', 'Hetty', 'King', 'Jackie', 'Burroughs', 'matriarch', 'King', 'clan', 'teacher', 'Avonlea', 'school', 'transition', 'high', 'society', 'Montreal', 'simple', 'life', 'P.E.I', 'difficult', 'Sara', 'who', 'endure', 'taunts', 'cousins', 'vain', 'Felicity', 'Gema', 'Zamprogna', 'mischievous', 'Felix', 'Zachary', 'Bennett', 'Fortunately', 'Aunt', 'Olivia', 'Mag', 'Ruffman', 'kindly', 'soul', 'Sara', 'friends', 'Jasper', 'Dale', 'R.H.', 'Thompson', 'local', 'recluse', 'who', 'put', 'magic', 'lantern', 'show', 'Sara', 'sobriquet', 'Story', 'Girl', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'was', 'based', 'not', 'only', 'two', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'featured', 'Sara', 'King', 'cousins', 'Story', 'Girl', 'Golden', 'Road', 'two', 'collections', 'short', 'stories', 'Chronicles', 'Avonlea', 'Further', 'Chronicles', 'Avonlea', 'Seven', 'eleven', 'episodes', 'were', 'based', 'specifically', 'Montgomery', 'writings', 'albeit', 'often', 'significant', 'changes', 'characters', 'fit', 'show', 'cast', 'Quarrantine', 'Alexander', 'Abraham', 'Old', 'Lady', 'Lloyd', 'Aunt', 'Abigail', 'Beau', 'come', 'Chronicles', 'Avonlea', 'Materialization', 'Duncan', 'Further', 'Chronicles', 'Proof', 'Pudding', 'Conversions', 'Hope', 'Chest', 'Arabella', 'King', 'are', 'chapters', 'Story', 'Girl', 'Three', 'adaptations', 'were', 'written', 'Heather', 'Conkie', 'who', 'would', 'continue', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'turning', 'Montgomery', 'story', 'episodes', 'future', 'stories', 'also', 'allowed', 'show', 'work', 'couple', 'beloved', 'characters', 'Sullivan', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'productions', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'Marilla', 'Cuthebert', 'Patricia', 'Hamilton', 'Mrs.', 'Rachel', 'Lynde.When', 'watched', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'again', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'much', 'do', 'not', 'Hetty', 'King', 'swear', 'when', 'get', 'final', 'episode', 'Nothing', 'Endures', 'Change', 'Hetty', 'upset', 'Sara', 'father', 'take', 'home', 'not', 'radical', 'thing', 'father', 'want', 'do', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Sara', 'want', 'continue', 'put', 'up', 'other', 'think', 'clear', 'Hetty', 'Sara', 'father', 'blaming', 'death', 'sister', 'Ruth', 'more', 'Sara', 'fact', 'episode', 'really', 'first', 'sign', 'affection', 'Hetty', 'towards', 'Sara', 'series', 'previous', 'episodes', 'Hetty', 'Felix', 'school', 'Olivia', 'child', 'listen', 'anything', 'brother', 'Alex', 'Cedric', 'Smith', 'say', 'most', 'level', 'headed', 'person', 'show', 'possible', 'exception', 'Peg', 'Bowen', 'Hetty', 'King', 'certainly', 'opinionated', 'was', 'right', 'more', 'often', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'such', 'burden', 'put', 'up', 'domineering', 'ways.During', 'first', 'season', 'Sara', 'Stanley', 'pretty', 'much', 'center', 'everything', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'was', 'not', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'day', 'certainly', 'own', 'comparison', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'continuing', 'clashes', 'Sara', 'Felicity', 'are', 'part', 'fun', 'coming', 'head', 'following', 'season', 'A', 'Mother', 'Love', 'impossible', 'watch', 'early', 'episodes', 'again', 'not', 'be', 'aware', 'hired', 'boy', 'Peter', 'Craig', 'who', 'was', 'destined', 'be', 'haughty', 'Felicity', 'husband', 'according', 'Montgomery', 'novels', 'will', 'be', 'replaced', 'Gus', 'Pike', 'romance', 'will', 'become', 'mainstay', 'series', 'matter', 'can', 'also', 'watch', 'initial', 'sparks', 'Olivia', 'Jasper', 'will', 'also', 'become', 'major', 'plotline', 'future.This', 'Canadian', 'series', 'aired', 'south', 'border', 'Avonlea', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'subscribed', 'simply', 'watch', 'episodes', 'honeymooned', 'PEI', 'White', 'Sands', 'Hotel', 'so', 'obvious', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Montgomery', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'are', 'slight', 'problems', 'video', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'bit', 'bothersome', 'times', 'totally', 'inexact', 'unscientific', 'description', 'would', 'be', 'pixels', 'were', 'squares', 'instead', 'octagons', 'whatever', 'are', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'digital', 'remastering', 'episodes', 'future', 'so', 'complaint', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'aside', 'enjoyment', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'can', 'be', 'complete']",N/A

They live next door to Uncle Alec King, his wife Janet and Sarah's cousins Felicity, Felix and young Cecily.There is considerable overlap with the ""Anne"" productions, as similar locations and productions are evident, but also with the inclusion of Colleen Dewhurst as Marilla Cuthbert and Patricia Hamilton as Rachel Lynde.These stories, though set more than 100 years ago, ring with true to life characters and situations.  This excellent series hardly ever took a false step, and the first season, establishing Sarah and the King family, is one of the best.  Seven seasons total were produced, and all have something to recommend. (Season two introduces the beloved Gus Pike).Gorgeous scenary and heartwarming storytelling make ""Avonlea"" one of the superior ""family"" series ever produced.",5,Return to Avonlea,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,1566,"['Canadian', 'filmmaker', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'made', 'superb', 'version', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'starring', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'early', '80s', 'sequel', 'Anne', 'Avonlea', 'was', 'equally', 'good', 'whetted', 'appetites', 'folks', 'who', 'appreciate', 'well-made', 'production', 'spunky', 'believable', 'characters', 'who', 'use', 'language', 'appropriate', 'children.Sullivan', 'returned', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'well', 'next', 'project', 'called', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'native', 'Canada', 'simply', 'Avonlea', 'when', 'broadcast', 'Disney', 'channel.Sarah', 'Polley', 'now', 'major', 'film', 'director', 'featured', 'Sarah', 'Stanley', 'pre-adolescent', 'motherless', 'girl', 'Montreal', 'who', 'sent', 'Avonlea', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'when', 'scandal', 'father', 'Sarah', 'live', 'Aunts', 'Hetty', 'Olivia', 'King', 'mother', 'sisters', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'Uncle', 'Alec', 'King', 'wife', 'Janet', 'Sarah', 'cousins', 'Felicity', 'Felix', 'young', 'Cecily.There', 'considerable', 'overlap', 'Anne', 'productions', 'similar', 'locations', 'productions', 'are', 'evident', 'also', 'inclusion', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'Marilla', 'Cuthbert', 'Patricia', 'Hamilton', 'Rachel', 'Lynde.These', 'stories', 'though', 'set', 'more', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'ring', 'true', 'life', 'characters', 'situations', 'excellent', 'series', 'hardly', 'ever', 'took', 'false', 'step', 'first', 'season', 'establishing', 'Sarah', 'King', 'family', 'one', 'best', 'Seven', 'seasons', 'total', 'were', 'produced', 'have', 'something', 'recommend', 'Season', 'two', 'beloved', 'Gus', 'Pike', '.Gorgeous', 'scenary', 'heartwarming', 'storytelling', 'make', 'Avonlea', 'one', 'superior', 'family', 'series', 'ever', 'produced']",N/A

740454,A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,B00008DZ8M,octobercountry,"[94, 96]","Looking through the Amazon listings for the ""Road to Avonlea"" series can be a little confusing, if you're trying to figure out exactly which edition of the series you're getting.The programme is slowly being re-released on DVD by the Sullivan company in a new edition described as a ""widescreen hi-def digital restoration.""  Well, that's all to the good, but please keep in mind that these are NOT high-definition Blu-ray releases.  They are standard DVDs which will play on any DVD machine.  I think it's extremely misleading to use the term ""HI-DEF"" in the promotional material.That said, these new releases are vastly superior to the old DVD sets, which had terrible quality-control issues and generally looked dreadful, with picture quality so grainy that the episodes looked like they were shot through a screen door.  The new transfers are very clean and sharp, and presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio---fitting the screen width of modern widescreen televisions.  Now, the series was shot on 35 mm film stock, which has an aspect ratio of 1.33:1.  So, these new releases do re-frame the picture slightly, cropping a bit off the top and bottom of the film frame.  However, I've done frame-to-frame comparisons of the old and new transfers, and I see that while there is a little cropping at the top and bottom, at the same time in the new transfer there is a little more picture visible on each side of the frame (which had been cropped off in the original release).  So, it's a bit of a trade-off in terms of how much of the picture you're getting, when comparing the old and new versions.  But the quality of the new transfers is so extremely superior to the old, I can't say I mind missing that tiny bit of picture from the upper and lower portions of the screen at all.A quick way to tell which edition of the series you're buying, is to look at the covers.  The new transfers have a wide bar of solid colour running across the top of the DVD case, with ""Road to Avonlea"" printed in large capital letters.  As of this writing (December 2010), the first three seasons have been re-released in this new format, and I do hope the remaining seasons will follow, as this is an EXCELLENT series!",5,Technical note,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,2197,"['Looking', 'Amazon', 'listings', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'confusing', ""'re"", 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'edition', 'series', ""'re"", 'getting.The', 'programme', 'slowly', 'being', 're-released', 'DVD', 'Sullivan', 'company', 'new', 'edition', 'described', 'widescreen', 'hi-def', 'digital', 'restoration', 'Well', 'good', 'please', 'keep', 'mind', 'are', 'NOT', 'high-definition', 'Blu-ray', 'releases', 'are', 'standard', 'DVDs', 'will', 'play', 'DVD', 'machine', 'think', 'extremely', 'misleading', 'use', 'term', 'HI-DEF', 'promotional', 'material.That', 'said', 'new', 'releases', 'are', 'vastly', 'superior', 'old', 'DVD', 'sets', 'had', 'terrible', 'quality-control', 'issues', 'generally', 'looked', 'dreadful', 'picture', 'quality', 'so', 'grainy', 'episodes', 'looked', 'were', 'shot', 'screen', 'door', 'new', 'transfers', 'are', 'very', 'clean', 'sharp', 'presented', '1.78:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', '-fitting', 'screen', 'width', 'modern', 'widescreen', 'televisions', 'Now', 'series', 'was', 'shot', '35', 'mm', 'film', 'stock', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.33:1', 'So', 'new', 'releases', 'do', 're-frame', 'picture', 'slightly', 'cropping', 'bit', 'top', 'bottom', 'film', 'frame', 'However', ""'ve"", 'done', 'frame-to-frame', 'comparisons', 'old', 'new', 'transfers', 'see', 'little', 'cropping', 'top', 'bottom', 'same', 'time', 'new', 'transfer', 'little', 'more', 'picture', 'visible', 'side', 'frame', 'had', 'been', 'cropped', 'off', 'original', 'release', 'So', 'bit', 'trade-off', 'terms', 'how', 'much', 'picture', ""'re"", 'getting', 'when', 'comparing', 'old', 'new', 'versions', 'quality', 'new', 'transfers', 'so', 'extremely', 'superior', 'old', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'mind', 'missing', 'tiny', 'bit', 'picture', 'upper', 'lower', 'portions', 'screen', 'all.A', 'quick', 'way', 'tell', 'edition', 'series', ""'re"", 'buying', 'look', 'covers', 'new', 'transfers', 'have', 'wide', 'bar', 'solid', 'colour', 'running', 'top', 'DVD', 'case', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'printed', 'large', 'capital', 'letters', 'writing', 'December', '2010', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 're-released', 'new', 'format', 'do', 'hope', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'will', 'follow', 'EXCELLENT', 'series']",N/A

Each episode is full of sweet moments, family life, exciting adventures, beautiful scenery, and much more. The content of these is minimal: it's a very family-friendly series, with only a few episodes with some objectionable content (like the Witches of Avonlea episode in this season).The storyline centers around Sarah Stanley, who comes to Prince Edward Island when her father is accused of embezzlement to live with relatives in a little town called Avonlea.  As she struggles to accept her new life and get along with her strict Aunt Hettie, her stuck-up cousin Felcity King, & tormenting cousin Felix King, Sarah must accept the changes in her young life.

740460,A2FRAS05LEI6JJ,B00008DZ8M,Sadie,"[1, 3]","Overall, the Avonlea series is based on the Anne of Green Gables books with the Sara character being developed from Anne.  I've already noticed some of the lines and scenes that came straight from the books, but which were incidents that Anne went through.When this series first came out I was disappointed because it lacked the enjoyment of Anne of Green Gables and it's sequal.  After viewing the entire first season I still believe Sarah Polley as Sara Stanley doesn't have the same endearing charm that Megan Follows had as Anne.  In fact, all the children in Avonlea are snottish or whiney.  Where Anne had a lot of friends with one main adversary in Josey Pie, Sara is disliked by even her own cousins, who are the other main child characters.  The real reason to watch the Avonlea series is because of the adults.  Although the snobery by the townfolk can be a bit much, and hopefully it will be tamed in future seasons, the adult actors bring years of film and stage experience with them to make their characters and Avonlea come alive.Unfortunately, Colleen Dewhurst as Marilla is only in two episodes of this season, but Patricia Hamilton as Rachel Lynde is in most episodes.  Both Mag Ruffman as Olivia King and Rosemary Dunsmore as Abigail King were in the Anne series but are given different and larger parts in Avonlea.  Jackie Burroughs as Aunt Hetty is played a bit too mean and hopefully will soften up in subsequent seasons.If you remember seeing this series when it originally came out and want to revisit it, or have children now, this is definitely good, fun family fare.  If you have it on VHS tapes, there's no reason to buy the DVDs because they do not offer a better visual than a tape would, nor are the extra special features worth spending the additional money on.

One of my favorite shows, ever since I first saw it as a ten year old, watching the Disney Channel!  Of course, I desperately wanted copies of all the episodes, so last year, I bought a bunch of the videos.  But now that I finally have a DVD player, I was eager to buy this set of the complete first season.  I was sooo happy when it arrived, and I popped it in and began watching.  The screen tests are so funny!  I just wish there were more of those, and it would be great if they added more cast interviews and things like that.  It was nice to see the episodes in order and a nice clear image onscreen.  I would have given this set five stars except for one itsy bitsy major disappointment.  Nowhere on any of the discs did they play the opening theme song!  AAACCKKK!!!!  For me, this was tragic.  I love and adore the theme song, and I love to watch the opening credits, the familiar scenes, ending in the back of Sarah Polley looking at the ocean with her hair blowing in the breeze...  If you are a fan of this show, then you must know what I am talking about.  Not for the first episode, or even the first one on each disc.  No theme song.  I am very sad.  Because of this, the set lost a star, but it is truly otherwise a wonderful thing.  If you love this show, go for it.  I guess it is good I got the videos after all.  They had the theme song on them!",4,"Wonderful, but...",1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,1387,"['Ah', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'One', 'favorite', 'shows', 'ever', 'first', 'saw', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'watching', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'course', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'copies', 'episodes', 'last', 'year', 'bought', 'bunch', 'videos', 'now', 'finally', 'have', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'eager', 'buy', 'set', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'sooo', 'happy', 'when', 'arrived', 'popped', 'began', 'watching', 'screen', 'tests', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'added', 'more', 'cast', 'interviews', 'things', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'episodes', 'order', 'nice', 'clear', 'image', 'onscreen', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'set', 'five', 'stars', 'one', 'itsy', 'bitsy', 'major', 'disappointment', 'Nowhere', 'discs', 'did', 'play', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'AAACCKKK', 'was', 'tragic', 'love', 'adore', 'theme', 'song', 'love', 'watch', 'opening', 'credits', 'familiar', 'scenes', 'ending', 'back', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'looking', 'ocean', 'hair', 'blowing', 'breeze', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'then', 'must', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'Not', 'first', 'episode', 'even', 'first', 'one', 'disc', 'theme', 'song', 'am', 'very', 'sad', 'set', 'lost', 'star', 'truly', 'otherwise', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'love', 'show', 'go', 'guess', 'good', 'got', 'videos', 'had', 'theme', 'song']",N/A

This year is especially significant as it marks the first time I'm sharing them with my five-and-a-half year old daughter. I actually wondered if she would take to them as I did, and she loved Season 1! The stories are based on LM Montgomery's works, the same author who gave us the belovedAnne of Green Gables: The Collectionstories (my all-time favorite childhood show!).The story in Road to Avonlea focuses on young Sara Stanley who is a rich girl living with her father in Montreal, Canada. When her father is wrongly accused of embezzlement, Sara is sent to live with her deceased mother's relatives on Prince Edward Island. Sara is accompanied by her long-time nanny, Louisa, and although they are meant to live with Uncle Alec and his family, the lack of room makes it necessary for Sara and Louisa to live with Sara's Aunt Hetty, an old schoolmistress, and Aunt Olivia, a gentle and kind soul.The stories is Season One focus on how Sara settles into her new surroundings, learning to live without the comforts of the big city, and having to do things for herself, yet loving the fresh and wild country air and surroundings, as well as the love and companionship of an extended family. Sara's cousins, i.e. vain Felicity King, naughty Felix, cute and kind Cecily, brainy Andrew, and farmhand Peter all get into scrapes of one kind or another, with Sara usually right in the thick of it! This makes the show engaging and fun to watch, not just for children but adults as well. It is perfect family-friendly drama. Some reviewers have taken issue with the depiction of the women of Avonlea as gossip-mongers and spiteful. Although at times it does appear that there is an abundance of idle chit-chat and gossip in some episodes, there is always a positive message at the end of each episode, where certain characters learn how to acknowledge their flaws and become better individuals.The episodes featured here include:The Journey Begins - how Sara comes to AvonleaThe Story Girl - Sara decides to help raise funds for the school libraryThe Materializing of Duncan McTavish - Marilla Cuthbert (Collen Dewhurst from Anne of Green of Gables) surprises everyone with the revelation of a long lost loveOld Lady Lloyd - a old lady and recluse intrigues Sara, especially when Sara senses a link between Old Lady Lloyd and a lovely young visitor blessed with a beautiful voiceProof of the Pudding - Felicity is appointed in charge when her parents go out of town, and mayhem ensuesConversions - focuses on the townfolks' prejudice against Peg Bowen, the local witchAunt Abigail - Janet King's spinster sister is surprised when an old flame comes back into her lifeMalcolm - an orphaned baby stirs up the emotions of Hetty, Rachel Lynde, and a newly married coupleFelicity's Challenge - Felicity gives in to peer pressure, but ends up hurting her closest friends.The Hope Chest of Arabella King - Olivia discovers a passion for writing, but needs to convince the local newspaper owner that she has a story worth writing aboutNothing Endures But Change",5,One of the best family shows ever!,1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,3161,"['year', 'right', 'now', 'fall', ""'ll"", 'dust', 'off', 'old', 'RTA', 'dvds', 'watch', 'again', 'beginning', 'Season', '1', 'year', 'especially', 'significant', 'first', 'time', ""'m"", 'sharing', 'five-and-a-half', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'actually', 'wondered', 'would', 'take', 'did', 'loved', 'Season', '1', 'stories', 'are', 'based', 'LM', 'Montgomery', 'works', 'same', 'author', 'who', 'gave', 'belovedAnne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Collectionstories', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'show', '.The', 'story', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'focuses', 'young', 'Sara', 'Stanley', 'who', 'rich', 'girl', 'living', 'father', 'Montreal', 'Canada', 'When', 'father', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'embezzlement', 'Sara', 'sent', 'live', 'deceased', 'mother', 'relatives', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'Sara', 'accompanied', 'long-time', 'nanny', 'Louisa', 'are', 'meant', 'live', 'Uncle', 'Alec', 'family', 'lack', 'room', 'necessary', 'Sara', 'Louisa', 'live', 'Sara', 'Aunt', 'Hetty', 'old', 'schoolmistress', 'Aunt', 'Olivia', 'gentle', 'kind', 'soul.The', 'stories', 'Season', 'One', 'focus', 'how', 'Sara', 'new', 'surroundings', 'learning', 'live', 'comforts', 'big', 'city', 'having', 'do', 'things', 'herself', 'yet', 'loving', 'fresh', 'wild', 'country', 'air', 'surroundings', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'companionship', 'extended', 'family', 'Sara', 'cousins', 'i.e', 'vain', 'Felicity', 'King', 'naughty', 'Felix', 'cute', 'kind', 'Cecily', 'brainy', 'Andrew', 'farmhand', 'Peter', 'get', 'scrapes', 'one', 'kind', 'Sara', 'usually', 'right', 'thick', 'show', 'engaging', 'fun', 'watch', 'not', 'just', 'children', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'perfect', 'family-friendly', 'drama', 'reviewers', 'have', 'taken', 'issue', 'depiction', 'women', 'Avonlea', 'gossip-mongers', 'spiteful', 'times', 'appear', 'abundance', 'idle', 'chit-chat', 'gossip', 'episodes', 'always', 'positive', 'message', 'end', 'episode', 'where', 'certain', 'characters', 'learn', 'how', 'acknowledge', 'flaws', 'become', 'better', 'individuals.The', 'episodes', 'featured', 'here', 'include', 'Journey', 'Begins', 'how', 'Sara', 'AvonleaThe', 'Story', 'Girl', 'Sara', 'help', 'raise', 'funds', 'school', 'libraryThe', 'Materializing', 'Duncan', 'McTavish', 'Marilla', 'Cuthbert', 'Collen', 'Dewhurst', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'everyone', 'revelation', 'long', 'lost', 'loveOld', 'Lady', 'Lloyd', 'old', 'lady', 'recluse', 'intrigues', 'Sara', 'especially', 'when', 'Sara', 'link', 'Old', 'Lady', 'Lloyd', 'lovely', 'young', 'visitor', 'blessed', 'beautiful', 'voiceProof', 'Pudding', 'Felicity', 'appointed', 'charge', 'when', 'parents', 'go', 'town', 'mayhem', 'ensuesConversions', 'focuses', 'townfolks', 'prejudice', 'Peg', 'Bowen', 'local', 'witchAunt', 'Abigail', 'Janet', 'King', 'spinster', 'sister', 'surprised', 'when', 'old', 'flame', 'back', 'lifeMalcolm', 'orphaned', 'baby', 'up', 'emotions', 'Hetty', 'Rachel', 'Lynde', 'newly', 'married', 'coupleFelicity', 'Challenge', 'Felicity', 'peer', 'pressure', 'up', 'hurting', 'closest', 'friends.The', 'Hope', 'Chest', 'Arabella', 'King', 'Olivia', 'passion', 'writing', 'convince', 'local', 'newspaper', 'owner', 'story', 'worth', 'writing', 'aboutNothing', 'Endures', 'Change']",N/A
