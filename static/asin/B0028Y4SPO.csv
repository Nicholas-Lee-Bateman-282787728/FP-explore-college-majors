1256317,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0028Y4SPO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 4]","To my bafflement, for I am a manly grown-up man, I'm here to review BARBIE AND THE THREE MUSKETEERS, a DVD I happened to sit thru when saddled with babysitting duties. Mattel has apparently been churning out this series of Barbie animated flicks with a focus on princessy fairy tale themes. This latest chapter is, of course, a role reversal take on Dumas' classic adventure. The iconic fashion doll plays Corinne, a hopeful 17-year-old French girl who leaves her lush Gascony countryside for the big city lights of Paris. With an introductory letter to Captain Tr&eacute;ville of the King's Royal Musketeers in hand, Corinne is determined to follow in her father D'Artagnan's footsteps. But in Paris she's ill-prepared for the blanket derision that greets her. For who's ever heard of a female Musketeer? Captain Tr&eacute;ville kindly rejects her.A despondent Corinne lands a job as cleaning maid in the royal palace and it's not long before she runs into Aramina, Renee, and Vivica, three enterprising young maids who also dream of becoming a Musketeer. And when an elderly chambermaid turns out to be a sort of swashbuckling sensei, cue the training montages set to generic female empowering pop music. Really, the songs are the only things that cheesed me off about the film. The songs, and Corinne's incredibly annoying kitten who wants to be a ""Muscateer"" (no, seriously).I'd bet my old collection of burly G.I. Joe action figures that this is one of the more action-oriented Barbie movies in the series. Surprisingly Corinne seems like she'd rather spend more time performing crazy acrobatics and dueling and adventuring than flirting with the handsome young Prince Louis. Prince Louis' coronation is fast approaching, even though he'd rather muck around with his inventions. Corinne and her friends stumble onto a plot to kill the prince, and you only have to cast a glance at the shady regent to suss out who's masterminding these assassinations. Sword fights and close shaves and sinister palace intrigue are elements I don't expect from Barbie movies, but as a manly man forced to sit thru these things, I will take it, and gratefully. The CG animation isn't up to what Pixar brings with its box office releases, but I think it's pretty good, even if the colors are a bit off. But the animators must've done a grip of motion capture renderings because the characters' movements look convincing and natural. Corinne, with her mad flips and somersaults and aerials, is particularly fun to watch.There's nothing objectionable in the film. In fact, positive themes abound. Young girls should be able to pick up those enduring lessons, ones revolving around the rewards of perseverance and diligence and hard work and that gender shouldn't define one's position or limit one's options in life. Surprisingly, I found myself engaged in watching BARBIE AND THE THREE MUSKETEERS, from the opening moment with Corinne's practice session in the barn to the exciting climax at the masquerade ball (The ""Hedda Lettuce"" bit made me snort unbecomingly). Corinne would make a brilliant Disney heroine even though I keep hoping she'd accidentally skewer her pet kitten. But, yeah, Mattel has got a good thing going with this Barbie animated film franchise.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Fake bloopers which the kids may enjoy (00:02:00 minutes long)- ""All for One"" Music Video- ""Unbelievable"" Music Video which features that damn kitten's lead vocals- ""Behind the Scenes: Barbie Fashion Show"" - this segment is pretty creepy as various New York fashion designers, models, and D-list celebrities jostle for camera time during a 2009 Barbie Fashion Show in New York (00:04:42 minutes)- ""I Can Be...

1256326,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B0028Y4SPO,Marshall Lord,"[52, 55]","Mattel's latest gender-reversed classic in the ""Barbie"" animated series begins on a farm in Gascony where Corinne, daughter of the famous D'Artagnan, is practicing her swordfighting moves. (Her idea of swordfighting seems to owe more to the ""Zorro"" films than anything you would actually expect to find in 17th century France, but never mind.)Corinne's life's ambition is to follow in her father's footsteps by becoming a royal musketeer. When she turns 17 she goes to Paris to enlist, carrying as D'Artagnan had before her, a letter of introduction to Monsieur de Treville, who is still Captain of the King's musketeers. (With the silver hair which is the only sign of age in this kind of film.)Unfortunately for Corinne, the 17th century French authorities are not ready for the idea of a lady musketeer (probably this reluctance is the most plausible part of the film.) So instead she has to accept a job as a maid at the palace.Just as D'Artagnan fell foul of ""the three musketeers"" on his first day in Paris and agreed to fight duels with each of them, Corinne has unfortunate meetings with three other girls while attempting to rescue her pet cat from an unpleasant dog belonging to the film's villain, and then finds that they are her new work colleagues.Despite this unfortunate start, Corinne becomes friends with her new colleagues and it turns out that all four share an ambition to be royal musketeers. So they begin to train in secret.Meanwhile the handsome Prince Louis, heir to the throne, is about to be crowned King on reaching his majority. His cousin Phillipe, who has been ruling France as Regent while Louis was a child, is less than happy at handing over power. Phillipe's nefarious plans are about to run into a most unexpected obstacle ...From my adult perspective this was quite the most ridiculous of all the Barbie films - the fact that the music to the climax of the film was the song ""unbelievable"" seemed only too appropriate. But this isn't aimed at adults, it's aimed at little girls and I have to report that my eight year old daughter loved it, as did her twin brother. And in fact some of the jokes in the film are quite funny: they had my wife as well as our children laughing out loud and raised a few smiles even from me.It has all the stock Barbie ingredients - a relentlessly positive heroine, a wicked villain, good and bad talking animals, etc. Like all the Barbie films ""Barbie and The Three Musketeers"" is also beautifully made, charming, and, if my daughter is anything to go by, can hold the attention of a little girl for hours.Before we first rented any of the Barbie videos for my daughter, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, and over-sugary. In general, however, I have been pleasantly surprised.Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccharine count, but the quality of that film and the other Barbie videos we have subsequently bought or rented, was significantly higher than I had originally expected before I saw the first one. They have kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - and also introduced them to some beautiful stories. Several of them also introduced my children to some great musical classics: others, of which this is one, had instead enjoyable original or modern music. In all cases Mattel had hired first class international orchestras to provide the instrumental soundtrack.On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony (Beethoven: Symphony No.6), or ""The Queen of the Night's aria"" from Mozart's opera ""Mozart: The Magic Flute"", and my daughter, who was then five years old, recognised and expressed appreciation of the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (""Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus"" and ""Barbie Fairytopia: Mermaidia"" respectively.)The music for ""Barbie and the three musketeers"" is easy on the ear, though this is not one of those Barbie films - there are some - which you would buy for the music.For reference, the Barbie films with beautiful musical scores taken largely from the classics include""Barbie of Swan Lake"" (with music from the ballet of that name)""Barbie in The Nutcracker"" (ditto)""Barbie and the Magic Of Pegasus"" (Beethoven)""Fairytopia II: Mermaidia"" (Mozart)""Barbie in the 12 dancing princesses dvd"" (Mendelsohn)""Barbie in a Christmas Carol"" (various traditional carols)The two best with music which is original rather than taken from the classics, are ""Barbie as The Island Princess"" and ""Barbie As The Princess and the Pauper"" the music for which I can particularly recommend.In terms of production values, the DVD runs smoothly and is fairly easy to navigate around: it is as visually beautiful as any of the Barbie films to date, which is quite a high standard, and contains a few extras such as games.Those people who enjoy criticising the way Mattel operate the Barbie franchise will not have much difficulty finding things in these films to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then these DVDs and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them.One charge which is sometimes made against the Barbie films but which does not hold much water is the idea that they reinforce gender stereotypes, and that criticism does not appear at all applicable to this particular film. It's a gender reversed story, and the heroine and central character is far more interested in foiling plots against the King than in going on a date with him.To summarise, these films are beautifully made, and will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so. And there are enough more sophisticated jokes thrown in that you won't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch ""Barbie and the Three Musketeers"" with your offspring.",4,"Preposterous,

Barbie stars as Corinne, Teresa stars as Viveca, Nikki as Renee, and Summer (who looks like Melody off of Diamond Castle) stars as Aramina. It has way more action than any of the previous Barbie movies. I loved the music, the animation, everything! The animation has changed so much since Barbie's first movies. The storyline is good, I've enjoyed other plots better, but it's still great. There are a few cheesy moments, were I was like 'yeah right' and the three little girls I babysit were cheering and whooping. (now they all want to be musketeers, so we're training!) It has a little bit of romance, not the kind I like, but it was still sweet. I love Aramina, who fights with her fans (that scene were she's battling a swordsman is really cool.) Viveca's weapons would be the most fun, I think, but she doesn't use them enough. Corinne is the best swordsman, yes, but it seems she relies more on her AMAZING athletic abilities. Renee, I was disappointed in, she only had a tiny slingshot, not the crossbow I thought she used. (and against these clashing swords and swirling ribbons, her weapon doesn't look too great.) I didn't like the sappy, weak, dreamer prince. Couldn't he have fought a little??? I wish they could have had a better blend, where the men and women fought equally, not the girls are better. It's like women's rights taken so far, that pretty soon we'll have a Men's Suffrege movement! This is NOT a classic Barbie movie. It's good, and I love it, but it's VERY different. Lately, everything about Barbie has been changing, and while I generally dislike change, this one was actually a fairly nice one. I was disappointed in Thumbelina, and, truthfully, somewhat in Diamond Castle. I  miss the older style of Barbie movies, with real romance and dance and true girlishness. Diamond Castle was good, the boys were handsome (for animation) and they at least TRIED to fight... but it was somewhat lacking. This one was a good blend of those classic basics and modern music with action and adventure. It could have used some work, though. Overall, it was enjoyable and the little girls I've watched it with enjoyed it, so 5 stars.",5,I love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!,1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,2278,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Barbie', 'when', 'saw', 'trailer', 'got', 'so', 'excited', 'ordered', 'day', 'came', 'out', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'Barbie', 'Corinne', 'Teresa', 'Viveca', 'Nikki', 'Renee', 'Summer', 'who', 'Melody', 'Diamond', 'Castle', 'Aramina', 'way', 'more', 'action', 'previous', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'loved', 'music', 'animation', 'everything', 'animation', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'Barbie', 'first', 'movies', 'storyline', 'good', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'other', 'plots', 'better', 'still', 'great', 'are', 'few', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'were', 'was', 'right', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'babysit', 'were', 'cheering', 'whooping', 'now', 'want', 'be', 'musketeers', ""'re"", 'training', 'little', 'bit', 'romance', 'not', 'kind', 'like', 'was', 'still', 'sweet', 'love', 'Aramina', 'who', 'fans', 'scene', 'were', 'battling', 'swordsman', 'really', 'cool', 'Viveca', 'weapons', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'fun', 'think', ""n't"", 'use', 'enough', 'Corinne', 'best', 'swordsman', 'yes', 'more', 'AMAZING', 'athletic', 'abilities', 'Renee', 'was', 'disappointed', 'only', 'had', 'tiny', 'slingshot', 'not', 'crossbow', 'thought', 'used', 'clashing', 'swords', 'swirling', 'ribbons', 'weapon', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'sappy', 'weak', 'dreamer', 'prince', 'Could', ""n't"", 'have', 'fought', 'little', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'blend', 'where', 'men', 'women', 'fought', 'equally', 'not', 'girls', 'are', 'better', 'women', 'rights', 'taken', 'so', 'far', 'pretty', 'soon', ""'ll"", 'have', 'Men', 'Suffrege', 'movement', 'NOT', 'classic', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'good', 'love', 'VERY', 'different', 'Lately', 'everything', 'Barbie', 'been', 'changing', 'generally', 'dislike', 'change', 'one', 'was', 'actually', 'fairly', 'nice', 'one', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Thumbelina', 'truthfully', 'somewhat', 'Diamond', 'Castle', 'miss', 'older', 'style', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'real', 'romance', 'dance', 'true', 'girlishness', 'Diamond', 'Castle', 'was', 'good', 'boys', 'were', 'handsome', 'animation', 'least', 'TRIED', 'fight', 'was', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'one', 'was', 'good', 'blend', 'classic', 'basics', 'modern', 'music', 'action', 'adventure', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'work', 'though', 'Overall', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'girls', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'so', '5', 'stars']",Barbie and The Three Musketeers

After 17 years of practice her dreams of going to Paris and becoming a musketeer like her dad isn't all it crack up to be as girls aren't musketeers. Getting a job as a servant girl she and the other girls that she had anything but a good first impression upon come across a plot against the prince. She and her soon to be friends who also dreams of being a musketeers themselves becomes the secret mask heroines of the kingdom.  Treating Barbie like a real actress in a movie and not some cartoon character the DVD includes behind the scenes bloopers and a great New York Barbie fashion show where women of different ages get to be Barbie from different era's of her existence.,5,Barbie and the Three Musketeers,1252972800,"09 15, 2009",2009,819,"['what', 'thought', 'was', 're-write', 'classic', 'tale', 'more', 'sequal', 'Barbie', 'Corinne', 'daughter', 'famous', 'Musketeer', 'Dartanion', '17', 'years', 'practice', 'dreams', 'going', 'Paris', 'becoming', 'musketeer', 'dad', ""n't"", 'all', 'crack', 'up', 'be', 'girls', 'are', ""n't"", 'musketeers', 'Getting', 'job', 'servant', 'girl', 'other', 'girls', 'had', 'anything', 'good', 'first', 'impression', 'come', 'plot', 'prince', 'soon', 'be', 'friends', 'who', 'also', 'being', 'musketeers', 'secret', 'mask', 'heroines', 'kingdom', 'Treating', 'Barbie', 'real', 'actress', 'movie', 'not', 'cartoon', 'character', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'great', 'New', 'York', 'Barbie', 'fashion', 'show', 'where', 'women', 'different', 'ages', 'get', 'be', 'Barbie', 'different', 'era', 'existence']",Barbie and The Three Musketeers
1256333,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B0028Y4SPO,PeaTee,"[28, 32]","In this re-write of Dumas' ""The Three Musketeers"", Barbie is a country lass named Corinne.  Like her deceased father, who just happens to have been D'Artagnan, it is her dream to serve and protect the royal family. But unlike her father she faces even more difficulties in getting to prove herself worthy of the Musketeer title because she is a girl.This then is the pivotal point of the plot, that girls can do whatever they want if they are willing to train for it and not let others squash there dreams.  And, in fact, this theme is extended to include everyone, even the Prince of France, who feels like he will have to give up his scientific interests once he becomes king.Corrine is joined in this adventure by 3 other girls, who also happen to want to be Musketeers. They are all athletic and bright, differing though in their interests. One quotes poetry, one plays the violin, and so forth. But because they are girls  they end up working as housekeepers in the palace until they discover that there is a plot against the prince's life. Then they are called upon to use all of their skills and inner strength to try to foil the plot.There is the usual music and dance numbers, as well as the usual avoidance of violence in this film. The talking animals include a mean-spirited dog, Corrine's cat, and a horse named Alexander.Talking Points:::I really liked the strong themes in the movie. Like every Barbie film there's a good underlying message and exemplary behavior.I thought the music was excellent. It's a little more trendy than in previous Barbie movies, and I'm even thinking about seeing if there's a DVD we can purchase.I thought the animation was not as good as in her other movies. However we saw this at the theater so that may have made small imperfections appear worse than they would at home.Overall, a very good movie.  I give it 4 Stars because some of the plotting was inferior to previous movies, and if you could only purchase one Barbie video for your child, I would suggest that BarbieBarbie in The Nutcrackerand BarbieBarbie As The Princess and the Pauperwere better choices.Pam T~",4,"Let the Adventure Begin! -- a review of ""Barbie and the 3 Musketeers""",1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,2115,"['re-write', 'Dumas', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'Barbie', 'country', 'lass', 'named', 'Corinne', 'deceased', 'father', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'been', ""D'Artagnan"", 'dream', 'serve', 'protect', 'royal', 'family', 'father', 'even', 'more', 'difficulties', 'getting', 'prove', 'worthy', 'Musketeer', 'title', 'girl.This', 'then', 'pivotal', 'point', 'plot', 'girls', 'can', 'do', 'want', 'are', 'willing', 'train', 'not', 'let', 'others', 'squash', 'there', 'dreams', 'fact', 'theme', 'extended', 'include', 'everyone', 'even', 'Prince', 'France', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'scientific', 'interests', 'once', 'king.Corrine', 'joined', 'adventure', '3', 'other', 'girls', 'who', 'also', 'happen', 'want', 'be', 'Musketeers', 'are', 'athletic', 'bright', 'differing', 'interests', 'One', 'poetry', 'one', 'violin', 'so', 'forth', 'are', 'girls', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'housekeepers', 'palace', 'discover', 'plot', 'prince', 'life', 'Then', 'are', 'called', 'use', 'skills', 'inner', 'strength', 'try', 'foil', 'plot.There', 'usual', 'music', 'dance', 'numbers', 'as', 'well', 'usual', 'avoidance', 'violence', 'film', 'talking', 'animals', 'include', 'mean-spirited', 'dog', 'Corrine', 'cat', 'horse', 'named', 'Alexander.Talking', 'Points', 'really', 'liked', 'strong', 'themes', 'movie', 'Barbie', 'film', 'good', 'underlying', 'message', 'exemplary', 'behavior.I', 'thought', 'music', 'was', 'excellent', 'little', 'more', 'trendy', 'previous', 'Barbie', 'movies', ""'m"", 'even', 'thinking', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'can', 'purchase.I', 'thought', 'animation', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'movies', 'However', 'saw', 'theater', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'small', 'imperfections', 'appear', 'worse', 'would', 'home.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'give', '4', 'Stars', 'plotting', 'was', 'inferior', 'previous', 'movies', 'could', 'only', 'purchase', 'one', 'Barbie', 'video', 'child', 'would', 'suggest', 'BarbieBarbie', 'Nutcrackerand', 'BarbieBarbie', 'Princess', 'Pauperwere', 'better', 'choices.Pam', 'T~']",Barbie and The Three Musketeers

It has a simple storyline, and the &#34;bad&#34; guy of course creates some scenes that sensitive kids may be afraid of, but nothing that I would called inappropriate. My niece loved the elderly lady teaching them how to be musketeers and how their dresses turned into there uniforms.",5,Great even for older kids!,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,419,"['daughter', 'loved', 'so', 'did', '13', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'movie', 'great', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'set', 'heart', 'too', 'simple', 'storyline', '34', 'bad', '34', 'guy', 'course', 'scenes', 'sensitive', 'kids', 'may', 'be', 'afraid', 'nothing', 'would', 'called', 'inappropriate', 'niece', 'loved', 'elderly', 'lady', 'teaching', 'how', 'be', 'musketeers', 'how', 'dresses', 'turned', 'uniforms']",Barbie and The Three Musketeers

We originally got this film for my son (12) who wanted to see the Musketeers, but ended up watching the entire production together.My son liked it for the animation quality. ""Good texturing"" he said.My 20 year old enjoyed it for the Barbie moments like the first time the four young ladies knocked off the glass fragments with boot, duster, and broom.  There is humor too, with the names of the girls as they enter the ball.Summer, Ivana Party, Countess Hadda Lettuice and Winter are the hits of the night as they uncover a plot to kill the prince.  The girls are discouraged as they train under the tutelage of the head maid (who seems to be a musketeer in hiding) in the 'old' training hall.  Musketeer or Maid?  It's Girl power to the resuce for the whole family.As a side note, there is music, friendly talking animals, romance, and enough adventure to keep viewers interested from ages 5 to 20!  Me, I'm 45 and I liked it.Great film.",5,A great family film,1253145600,"09 17, 2009",2009,1038,"['Hold', 'off', 'preconceptions', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'appropriate', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'originally', 'got', 'film', 'son', '12', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'Musketeers', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'entire', 'production', 'together.My', 'son', 'liked', 'animation', 'quality', 'Good', 'texturing', 'said.My', '20', 'year', 'old', 'enjoyed', 'Barbie', 'moments', 'first', 'time', 'four', 'young', 'ladies', 'knocked', 'off', 'glass', 'fragments', 'boot', 'duster', 'broom', 'humor', 'too', 'names', 'girls', 'enter', 'ball.Summer', 'Ivana', 'Party', 'Countess', 'Hadda', 'Lettuice', 'Winter', 'are', 'hits', 'night', 'uncover', 'plot', 'kill', 'prince', 'girls', 'are', 'discouraged', 'train', 'tutelage', 'head', 'maid', 'who', 'be', 'musketeer', 'hiding', ""'old"", 'training', 'hall', 'Musketeer', 'Maid', 'Girl', 'power', 'resuce', 'whole', 'family.As', 'side', 'note', 'music', 'friendly', 'talking', 'animals', 'romance', 'enough', 'adventure', 'keep', 'viewers', 'interested', 'ages', '5', '20', 'Me', ""'m"", '45', 'liked', 'it.Great', 'film']",Barbie and The Three Musketeers
