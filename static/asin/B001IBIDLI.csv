Danny McBride as Kenny Powers is funny and does make a great lead character. However, I really didnt laugh too much. Probably because i've seen so much of this humor that it's hard to stay fresh and come up with something really funny. Will Ferrell as car dealer, Ashely Schaffer, was funny and really stole the two shows he appeared in.

1203089,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B001IBIDLI,Armando N. Roman,"[1, 2]","I heard about Eastbound & Down on a podcast when people were talking about good shows on tv. I rarely have time to watch anything good with my work hours, so I decided to give it a shot after being floored by a compiliation video: The Best of Kenny Powers (the main character in the show). Sure enough, the show is a modern masterpiece. Kenny Powers is sure to become the next Tony Soprano if the show continues and gets more exposure. He's crude, seemingly has almost no morals, and rarely makes any good choices. Basically, he's the kind of person everyone hates. And yet they made this guy one of the most likable characters out there. Normally someone like this is only good in small doses, but over the span of six episodes in this season, I never once got sick of him.Kenny Powers was the top pitcher in pro baseball. But when he won a major game, he didn't exactly have good sportsmanship about it, and got a reputation for being an obnoxious jerk soon after. He fell off the radar after no teams wanted him to play for them, and eventually he lost all of his money since he wasn't bankable. Kenny then moved in with his brother and his family (wife and kids), who live normal lives, but Kenny continues to act like a big shot baseball star, and constantly mentions that someone will be calling any day to sign him up, or that he has a job waiting for him and it'll bring in big money. Of course, it doesn't happen, and he resorts to working as a gym class teacher. It's here where he tries to really take control, and tries to get the attention of an ex of his, who's one of the [super hot] teachers there too. The show chronicles Kenny's failed attempts at getting a better job, going on with his life, and not realizing that he's really just a loser now. And every minute's hilarious.I just plain love this show. There are a lot of guest appearances by actors I don't care for, like Will Ferrell, but they're a riot here. You can't help but love the cast of secondary characters too, like the weird music teacher who admires Kenny to the point where it's either a very perverted man-crush, or very odd stalker thing. The jokes never get that ""hey, laugh here!"" feeling, and most of the humor is in what they're talking about or the fact that Kenny's such a jerk. Really, I can't stress how bad Kenny is, and you'll just have to see footage of him for yourself to get it. Danny McBride pulls out all the stops with this character. The episodes here are all linked together, but anyone can watch just one episode and not feel left out. I really hope they can keep the quality of Eastbound & Down going for its second season without cheapening anything like how other great shows did, like The Boondocks.The picture and audio quality for the show is pretty good. 'nothing special, but it's not like this is some action-packed show with explosions happening every couple of minutes. The dvd gets the job done. The real treat is the special features, from the commentaries to the deleted scenes to the blooper reel. Each extra is excellent, and anyone who likes the show will get a lot out of them. I recommend watching the bloopers first, just to see how many takes it took to get one scene right, where you can't help but admire the actors for finally making it through without laughing at how insane the dialogue is.So if I have nothing bad to say about the show, why 4 out of 5 stars? As great as it is, this is just a six episode season. Six episodes at around 30 minutes each should net it a lower price. Look at shows like South Park and Six Feet Under that have a lot more episodes for the same price, and you gotta wonder why this one goes for the same price as them. Regardless, Eastbound & Down is worth checking out for anyone who loves crude, obscene humor or whatever kind you'd call Strangers With Candy.

1203090,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B001IBIDLI,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","Kenny Powers is a former baseball pitcher, noted for his powerful throws. He has been forced out of the game due to his drug-taking, partying, abrasive personality and use of steroids, all of which has also left him broke. Returning to his hometown of Shelby, North Carolina, he is forced to move in with his brother's family and take up a position as a temporary sports coach at his old high school. Powers is determined to both return to the major leagues and win back his old sweetheart, who is now engaged to the school principal, but finds it difficult to change his lifestyle and attitude.Eastbound and Down is a HBO comedy show starring Danny McBride, who also co-created the series. It's strongly similar in style to the Will Ferrell school of comedy (Ferrell is a producer on the show and has a recurring role), based on social faux pas and inappropriate behaviour with awkward silences and a healthy dose of swearing and occasional gross-out moments. However, freed from the cliches of the two-hour comedy movie format, the show is more successful at achieving a decent level of characterisation and (mostly) avoiding mawkish sentiment.McBride is the show's main star and makes the character of Powers work well. He's not a particularly sympathetic figure, especially as he himself is responsible for almost all of his problems, but is funny and possesses enough personality to make it plausible that he'd have so many friends and people who want to help him, despite his appalling behaviour. Most of the rest of the cast puts in good work, especially John Hawkes and Jennifer Irwin as Kenny's long-suffering brother and sister-in-law, but the show relies on McBride's performance in order to function and he does a good job with the more dramatic stuff (particularly the final episode, which Powers's ambitions and dreams are not so much crushed as painfully atomised) as well as the humour.The show employs an interesting device where each episode begins the moment the previous ends (breaking this format once), with the story continuously developing over the six-episode season. Character relationships evolve fairly steadily (and amusingly), although Powers's nemesis, Principal Cutler, doesn't work very well. It's good to see Will Ferrell being used fairly sparingly, but also disappointing that Craig Robinson's hilariously inept rival baseball player doesn't get more screentime.There are some problems with pacing. The show frontloads a lot of its best gags into the first episode and the rest suffer a little in the process, whilst a fair few characters are under-utilised. The short length of the season (six 30-minute episodes) also prevents a number of side-stories from being developed. This does result in a concise, focused series that is surprisingly restless, unwilling to settle into a predictable format and takes a major turn in direction at its conclusion.The first season of Eastbound and Down (***) is watchable, funny and overall enjoyable thanks to some good performances, but is slightly let down by uneven pacing, a fair few jokes and moments that fall flat. The show is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",4,"Amusing, with some decent characterisation as well.",1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,3172,"['Kenny', 'Powers', 'former', 'baseball', 'pitcher', 'noted', 'powerful', 'throws', 'been', 'forced', 'game', 'due', 'drug-taking', 'partying', 'abrasive', 'personality', 'use', 'steroids', 'also', 'left', 'broke', 'Returning', 'hometown', 'Shelby', 'North', 'Carolina', 'forced', 'move', 'brother', 'family', 'take', 'up', 'position', 'temporary', 'sports', 'coach', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'Powers', 'determined', 'return', 'major', 'leagues', 'win', 'back', 'old', 'sweetheart', 'who', 'now', 'engaged', 'school', 'principal', 'difficult', 'change', 'lifestyle', 'attitude.Eastbound', 'Down', 'HBO', 'comedy', 'show', 'starring', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'who', 'also', 'co-created', 'series', 'strongly', 'similar', 'style', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'school', 'comedy', 'Ferrell', 'producer', 'show', 'recurring', 'role', 'based', 'social', 'faux', 'pas', 'inappropriate', 'behaviour', 'awkward', 'silences', 'healthy', 'dose', 'swearing', 'occasional', 'gross-out', 'moments', 'However', 'freed', 'cliches', 'two-hour', 'comedy', 'movie', 'format', 'show', 'more', 'successful', 'achieving', 'decent', 'level', 'characterisation', 'mostly', 'avoiding', 'mawkish', 'sentiment.McBride', 'show', 'main', 'star', 'character', 'Powers', 'work', 'well', 'not', 'particularly', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'especially', 'responsible', 'almost', 'problems', 'funny', 'enough', 'personality', 'make', 'plausible', ""'d"", 'have', 'so', 'many', 'friends', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'help', 'appalling', 'behaviour', 'Most', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'work', 'especially', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'Jennifer', 'Irwin', 'Kenny', 'long-suffering', 'brother', 'sister-in-law', 'show', 'McBride', 'performance', 'order', 'function', 'good', 'job', 'more', 'dramatic', 'stuff', 'particularly', 'final', 'episode', 'Powers', 'ambitions', 'dreams', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'crushed', 'painfully', 'atomised', 'as', 'well', 'humour.The', 'show', 'interesting', 'device', 'where', 'episode', 'moment', 'previous', 'ends', 'breaking', 'format', 'once', 'story', 'continuously', 'developing', 'six-episode', 'season', 'Character', 'relationships', 'evolve', 'fairly', 'steadily', 'amusingly', 'Powers', 'nemesis', 'Principal', 'Cutler', ""n't"", 'work', 'very', 'well', 'good', 'see', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'being', 'used', 'fairly', 'sparingly', 'also', 'disappointing', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'hilariously', 'inept', 'rival', 'baseball', 'player', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'screentime.There', 'are', 'problems', 'pacing', 'show', 'lot', 'best', 'gags', 'first', 'episode', 'rest', 'suffer', 'little', 'process', 'fair', 'few', 'characters', 'are', 'under-utilised', 'short', 'length', 'season', 'six', '30-minute', 'episodes', 'also', 'number', 'side-stories', 'being', 'developed', 'result', 'concise', 'focused', 'series', 'surprisingly', 'restless', 'unwilling', 'settle', 'predictable', 'format', 'major', 'turn', 'direction', 'conclusion.The', 'first', 'season', 'Eastbound', 'Down', '***', 'watchable', 'funny', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'thanks', 'good', 'performances', 'slightly', 'let', 'down', 'uneven', 'pacing', 'fair', 'few', 'jokes', 'moments', 'fall', 'flat', 'show', 'available', 'now', 'UK', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'USA', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray']",Eastbound & Down: Season 1

I learned in a Burger King when the guy waiting on me wanted to commiserate with me over our losing the game and all I could say was, ""You mean they're back?""So for me to enjoy a sports based tv series is saying one heck of a lot.  The main reason is that Danny McBride, in the lead role as the former star baseball player forced to teach school and live with this brother, is absolutely hilarious.  You are tempted to really hate him.  He is totally obnoxious.  He is trying to do everything in his power to get back into the big time with nary a hint of regret over his own behavior which brought about his downfall.  Yet there is something just so universal about how far he has fallen and how hard he tries to keep going to pick himself back up. His efforts to do so are obnoxious, humiliating, touching and hilarious.  Two favorite moments for me were his trying to sell his memorabilia on ebay for big bucks and dictating his own audiobook on how to be a big deal.Will Farrell's production company got this off the ground for HBO and Farrell himself plays the major car dealer in town who is able to lord it over the former big deal sports star.  He is almost unrecognizable in his wig and other accessories but he is also hilarious as usual.I tried watching FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, which has gotten excellent reviews, but I couldn't get past the sports in that show.  I made it through one episode and gave up.  So it has got to be the writing and the comedy in this show that make it happen for me.This is an HBO show, which comes as no big surprise.  I really wonder how we lived through tv shows before HBO got into doing tv series.

I really enjoyed the Foot Fist Way and was hoping for something similar.  Suffice to that all of my expectations were met.The show is about an out of work major league baseball player named Kenny Powers...Forced out of the league due to drug use and a lacking performance, he moves to a small town to live with his brother.  Eventually Kenny gets a job subbing at an elementary school where he meets up with an old flame who's engaged to the extremely nerdy principal.The 6 episodes follow Kenny Powers as he attempts to get back into MLB.  A lot of familiar faces pop up throughout the series, Will Farrel and Craig Robinson just to name a few.The comedy style is similar to that of the Apatow crew, so if you're a fan of those films then this will be up your alley.  However, some people have grown tired of that clan, but I urge you to set aside your differences and check out this show with an open mind.Now lets talk about the DVD.

Yes this show is totally vulgar and crass and crude with the constant profanity not to mention nudity and blatant drug use but it made me laugh out loud and I've only watched one episode. The language is so pervasive that it becomes almost a character of its own the way Tom Cruise's foul-mouthed character Les Grossman in &#34;Tropic Thunder&#34; made that movie as funny as it was offensive. I don't usually watch stuff with constant profanity because I find it distracting and irritating but since I was laughing out loud I kept watching. This show is funny and Kenny Powers is such a lovable loser that I will continue to watch it until I don't like it anymore or until there are no more eps to watch. The other characters are funny just the way they are so stunned and speechless at Powers' attitude and behavior and speech. So far so good.

As the series opens he winds up back in his hometown sleeping on his married with children brother's couch and teaching at his former high school. He views others as his audience.  They don't exist except to boost his ego.  They're all enablers allowing Kenny to sponge off them.  Kenny Powers talks about himself ad nauseum and always in the third person.  He tells his gym class how great he is, he struts past his fellow teachers, one who's his ex-girlfriend another who hero worshiped Kenny back in high school because he'd been one of the cool kids who wouldn't let him hang out with them.

And I loved every greasy, bloated minute of it.  Danny McBride creates one of the most instantly memorable, disturbingly loveable characters in modern television history.  An egotistical, once gifted pitcher for whom the terms knucklehead and knuckleball seem simultaneously appropriate.  McBride's Kenny has been so well thought out, is so beautifully portrayed and so believable the show - especially in the current trend of filming comedies - has the authenticity of a documentary.Kenny Power's treatment of everyone around him - or anyone who might pass even remotely through his universe - reveals a realistically bigoted monster of legendary proportions.  He is the sort of creation the worlds of sport and entertainment have routinely specialized in creating since the invention of the motion picture camera, stroking their egos, kowtowing to their idiotic whims, and both ignoring and rewarding offensive behavior for one reason only:  it sells tickets.  Once, however, these Neanderthals cease to be of use to the organization (in this instance Major League Baseball) they are dropped back into the primitive worlds from whence they came with nary a thought or care about how they are to survive in a world they longed to escape from, but now find themselves hopelessly and ill prepared to face.  Tragic?  Oh yeah.  But effin' hilarious, too!Kenny is clearly modeled on an amalgamation of baseball personas - John Rocker, Roger Clements, Jose Conseco . . . and more all show up in the way Kenny turns a phrase, carts his bloated carcass across the screen, and preens before the public believing he is the cock of the walk.Interestingly, his fall from grace occurs within the first five minutes of the series - and we see the aftermath of celebrity excess and abuse of privilege as Kenny struggles to eke out a living as a substitute middle school teacher, living in his brother and sister-in-laws den and hang on to what little dignity he thinks he has left - which unfortunately for him (but blessedly for us) overs somewhere between zero and negative 1000.Kudos to HBO and their production team (including Will Ferrell, who plays a classic over-the-top car dealer eager to play up to the former baseballs star's fame and cash in for his own devilishly delicious purposes)  in presenting this timely, entertaining and sometimes surprisingly touching show.  The entire cast seems to actually live their roles - in particularly Katy Mixon who shines as Kenny's voluptuous former Southern Belle girlfriend, John Hawkes and Jennifer Irwin as his Kenny's much put upon brother and sister-in-law, former former beau and Steve Little nearly walks away with the show as the horrificly nerdy band teacher Stevie Janowski who during the course of the series becomes so disturbingly obsessed with Kenny it reaches the point of dark, homoerotic stalking.Even though it consists chiefly of six short episodes, the highly episodic style in which this is filmed gives the feel not of a short series, but rather of an excellent - laugh til you burst - 3 hour film of comic genius.

But the similarities end there. &#34;Curb Your Enthusiasm&#34; is invested with the belief in justice, at least, justice in human relationships. David's misfortunes stem from his insistence on being right, his refusal to apologize, his willingness to lie, cheat, and exploit others for his own ends. In other words, he gets what he deserves.Kenny Powers, on the other hand, does not suffer any consequences for his unrelenting mistreatment of those closest to him - his brother's family, the kids unlucky enough to be subjected to his gym class, and the band teacher who idolizes him. Instead, he is abused by people to whom he has done nothing, such as the school principal and Will Ferrell's hilarious auto dealer. One can only conclude that these characters despise Powers for having allowed his career to disintegrate.I disagree with other reviewers' contention that Powers grows or evolves by the series' end. The final scene proves that he has learned nothing. The eventual affection of his former flame, who he relentlessly stalks through the series, is not credible - unless she is a lot shallower than she first appears to be.It is fun to watch a racist, sexist, ignorant character make a fool of himself, but &#34;Eastbound and Down&#34; shortchanges in this regard as well.

He lives with his brother (Deadwood's John Hawkes) and his disapproving wife (Jennifer Irwin), and teaches physical education at the local high school where he tries to woo his old flame April (Katy Mixon) who is engaged to the uptight principal (Andrew Daly).

I find it funny that I've used the word ""quality"" to describe Eastbound because it's one of the most vulgar and non P.C shows you can watch. The premise of ""Eastbound"" follows the rise and fall of Major League pitcher Kenny Powers(played by the hilarious Danny McBride)  who's racism, homophobia and indifference make him a controversial icon,but after Kenny's meteoric rise his pitch begins to lose it's zip and he's kicked out of the majors. Defamed and ostracized,Kenny returns to his home town can takes up a P.E teaching job at his old middle school. Now one of the ""ordinary People"" Kenny plots to make it back to the majors and steal the heart of this old high school flame(katy Mixon)between making his brother's life hell, starting a feud with a used car sales man, and taking a lot of drugs. At first I was a little skeptical about Eastbound because its plot seems pretty simplistic but one episode in I was a fan. What's nice about Eastbound is that it takes a completely despise able character in Powers and somehow makes him lovable. Though it is a comedy, Eastbound fells like a drama most of the time because though Powers shows a uncaring and selfish exterior we see that his sort comings and failures hurt and effect him just like anyone else. He's human, even though he'd like to think he's more than that.My only complaint is that the season is pretty short(six episodes)but the extras make up for it. There's a blooper and deleted scenes section. There's also a full length version of the ""Kenny Power"" scouting video, cheesy explosion effects in all. hilarious!",4,Funny as #$%@!,1248912000,"07 30, 2009",2009,1695,"['usually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'HBO', 'shows', 'Eastbound', 'Down', 'HBO', 'hot', 'streak', 'quality', 'programing', 'find', ""'ve"", 'used', 'word', 'quality', 'describe', 'Eastbound', 'one', 'most', 'vulgar', 'non', 'P.C', 'shows', 'can', 'watch', 'premise', 'Eastbound', 'rise', 'fall', 'Major', 'League', 'pitcher', 'Kenny', 'Powers', 'played', 'hilarious', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'who', 'racism', 'homophobia', 'indifference', 'make', 'controversial', 'icon', 'Kenny', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'pitch', 'lose', 'zip', 'kicked', 'majors', 'Defamed', 'ostracized', 'Kenny', 'home', 'town', 'can', 'up', 'P.E', 'teaching', 'job', 'old', 'middle', 'school', 'Now', 'one', 'ordinary', 'People', 'Kenny', 'plots', 'make', 'back', 'majors', 'steal', 'heart', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'flame', 'katy', 'Mixon', 'making', 'brother', 'life', 'hell', 'starting', 'feud', 'used', 'car', 'sales', 'man', 'taking', 'lot', 'drugs', 'first', 'was', 'little', 'skeptical', 'Eastbound', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simplistic', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'fan', 'What', 'nice', 'Eastbound', 'completely', 'despise', 'able', 'character', 'Powers', 'somehow', 'lovable', 'comedy', 'Eastbound', 'drama', 'most', 'time', 'Powers', 'uncaring', 'selfish', 'exterior', 'see', 'sort', 'comings', 'failures', 'hurt', 'effect', 'just', 'anyone', 'else', 'human', 'even', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'more', 'that.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'season', 'pretty', 'short', 'six', 'episodes', 'extras', 'make', 'up', 'blooper', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'section', 'also', 'full', 'length', 'version', 'Kenny', 'Power', 'scouting', 'video', 'cheesy', 'explosion', 'effects', 'hilarious']",Eastbound & Down: Season 1

1203152,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B001IBIDLI,Wheelchair Assassin,"[6, 9]","Disgraced ex-baseball star Kenny Powers may be a dinosaur, a relic of a thankfully bygone time when casual racism, sexist objectification, drunkenness, profanity, and homophobia were still acceptable.  Or he may be a Neitzchean superman, unfettered by the shackles of political correctness and a slave morality that encourages equality at the expense of excellence.  Eastbound and Down makes a pretty strong case for both viewpoints, doing a solid job of holding its main character and his anachronistic behaviors up for ridicule while at the same time turning him into a sympathetic, and at times almost tragic figure.  It's helped immensely in this endeavor by Danny McBride, who did some solid work in the underrated Pineapple Express and the overrated Tropic Thunder but wasn't anywhere near as much in his element as he is here in the role of Kenny.  Boasting a heavy drawl and a mullet that manages to be as funny as any of the show's myriad of great lines, McBride is utterly convincing as a guy who was apparently never told that the feminist, civil rights, and gay-rights movements took place, or that the word ""retard"" is no longer an appropriate way to refer to the mentally challenged.A former John Rocker-esque pitching phenom known as much for his off-field excesses and offensive pronouncements as for his overpowering fastball, Kenny returns to his North Carolina hometown in the show's premiere a shell of his former self, with his career and finances in ruins and no better options than shacking up with his family-man older brother and taking a job teaching gym at the local middle school (the show never mentions when he got the college degree required to teach, but that's a minor quibble).  Even though he's exhausted much of the currency once afforded him by his wealth and celebrity, upon his arrival Kenny still proceeds to cut a swath of destruction through his community, swearing freely around his impressionable students and nephews, disrespecting his principal (who also happens to be the fiance of his top-heavy ex-girlfriend), consuming frightening amounts of intoxicants, and trashing the local car dealership after a personal appearance gone bad.  At the same time, Kenny tries, initially with little success, to resurrect his pitching career and his relationship with his aforementioned ex April, now an art teacher at the same school who's divided between repulsion at Kenny's continued immaturity and lingering attraction to his bad-boy persona.  Much of the show's bountiful comedy comes from the gulf between Kenny's inflated view of himself and the humdrum lives of those who surround him--his former alpha-male brother is now a defeated home contractor, his sister-in-law named her daughter after a character from Titanic and gets her thrills by selling stuff on eBay, and even his high-school girlfriend is engaged to an emasculated, smoothie-drinking principal.If nothing else, Eastbound and Down serves as a showcase for the humor to be wrung out of sheer wrongness.  The show seems to take place in some parallel universe where it's acceptable to say just about anything around just about anybody, and while that may detract from the realism a bit, its purposeful excesses provide a nice contrast with pretty much anything else on TV these days, as well as further proof that swearing at children is a reliable comic goldmine.  At the same time, though, Eastbound and Down is as much a character study as an outrageous farce, examining what happens when someone who's always viewed himself (and been viewed by others) as unique and superior is taken down a few pegs and forced to live among the common people.  Beneath Kenny's drug use, arrogance, and overall loathsomeness--almost all of which is funny--lies a bracing undercurrent of darkness fuelled by his mounting knowledge that his days of being exceptional may be behind him.  One of the show's best bits involves Kenny listening to his own audiobook reading of his profanity-laced, self-aggrandizing autobiography, which is initially played mainly for laughs but providesan increasingly sobering counterpoint to his ongoing catharsis as the season progresses.At only six episodes of about 25 minutes each, the first season almost has the feel of a long movie, but without compromising the emphasis on character that marks the best TV.  While I have a hard time imagining this ever happening, I think McBride deserves serious Emmy consideration for his work as Kenny--his performance effortlessly mixes the comic, the profane, and the just plain sad, turning what could have just been an amusing diversion into a show with some real depth and dramatic weight amidst all the gratuitous cursing and nudity.  I heard somewhere that the show has been picked up for a second season, and while it will probably be funny it will also be unnecessary.  TV may be all about telling ongoing stories and watching characters evolve over time, but this season doesn't require any followup.",4,As funny as it is wrong,1243209600,"05 25,
