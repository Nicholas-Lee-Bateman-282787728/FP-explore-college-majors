1621155,A3UZQ1IW3XUZ73,B00B27WRLU,"B. Cathey ""ParsifalCSA""","[8, 8]","Famed director John Ford once said that &#34;The Sun Shines Bright&#34; was his favorite film, and it is not hard to see why. Basically, this is a remake of his much earlier, &#34;Judge Priest,&#34; from 1934 (starring Will Rogers). Ford critics tend to favor that earlier film version of Irvin Cobb's delightful short stories of old Kentucky, but I have always believed that this version is superior, not the least because Charles Winninger's acting is actually sharper and the dialogue crisper. Certainly, Rogers was a superb actor, but too many times his dialogue seems to trail on and on, becoming nearly unintelligible. Then, again, filmmaking in 1934 was not the same as in 1953.Winninger was an accomplished Hollywood role player; but in &#34;The Sun Shines Bright&#34; he demonstrates that he was no simple comprimario or &#34;co-star.&#34; He alternately illustrates humor, wisdom, sadness, and wistfulness.  It's a superb performance.  Despite the inevitable criticism that may come regarding this film not being &#34;politically correct&#34; (it isn't!), Ford probes human emotions and character, irrespective of race or social status. And the old Judge Priest---&#34;trumpeter little Billy Priest&#34;---understands fully the reality of justice, which he metes out to all, white and black, decent people and prostitutes. Certainly he does so in a social context that some present-day viewers may find foreign to &#34;modern&#34; sensibilities; but, getting beyond that stifling veneer of PC thought, and enjoying &#34;The Sun Shines Bright&#34; on its own terms can be an immensely rewarding experience.Ford was indeed correct; it may well be one of his best films. Co-stars include John Russell, Slim Pickens, Russell Simpson, Arleen Whelan, Milburn Stone (of later &#34;Gunsmoke&#34; fame), Jane Darwell, and Steppin' Fetchit.I have the Blu-ray version, which is superb.
