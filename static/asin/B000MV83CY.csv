1051132,A1I1GC24YNZJO2,B000MV83CY,A. Ryan,"[57, 57]","Countless people know the story about the famous apparitions of Our Lady to Bernadette Soubirous in Lourdes in 1858, and the shrine that millions now visit in Lourdes every year because of those apparitions, and the miraculous stream that Bernadette discovered at the direction of Our Lady. But not many people know about the ""rest of the story"", the story about Bernadette's life after those apparitions - the story of how she became a saint.This well-made feature film tells that story, which in some ways is even more compelling than the first part of her story, the apparitions. Because it shows how she lived out the rest of her young life in a spirit of deep faith, charity, and humility, and how much suffering she endured with heroic virtue and courage. She suffered greatly both physically and spiritually, and thus the title of this film ""The Passion of Bernadette."" French filmmaker Jean Delannoy has a deep love and respect for Bernadette (even though he himself is not a Catholic) and wanted to tell the whole story of her life in film, a story of heroism in the small things of her daily life that inspired him to show why Bernadette really was such a great woman. (He also made the first film, ""Bernadette"".) Just seeing the Mother of God does not make someone a saint. Delannoy shows how this simple peasant girl had to struggle greatly with the fame and constant harassment those apparitions brought upon her, even in her own convent, and how she dealt with all that as well as her serious physical sufferings.Actress Sydney Penny is even better in this sequel to her first film, BERNADETTE, as she captures the true spirit of Bernadette's kindness, strength of character, courage, humility and enduring faith in daily life. She shows how Bernadette was very similar to Therese of Lisieux in becoming a great saint through the ""little way"" of practicing heroic virtue in the many little things that make up our daily lives.This unsung film on the ""passion"" of St. Bernadette is a powerful story and cinematic gem about what it means to become a saint through the ordinary events of everyday life.

When her visions of the ""Lady of White"" come to an end the young seer decides to become a ""Bride of Christ' and enters into a convent to dedicate herself to her Catholic faith and live the rest of her life as a nun. Since the film deals with Bernadette's life  behind convent walls the non-Catholic viewers will probably find this film rather slow and mundane. By its very nature the life of a nun is one of prayer, humility and self-sacrifice, all of which do not translate well into an entertaining, cinematic format.Having that said it is still a moving portrayal of a saint-in-training beautifully played by Sydney Penny. It's more than worthy of a watch or two for Catholics and seekers alike.",4,"""I Too Need Peoples Prayers ~ To Be Worthy Of Heaven""",1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,787,"['Released', ""'89"", 'Passion', 'Bernadette', 'begins', 'where', 'film', ""'Bernadette"", 'ends', 'When', 'visions', 'Lady', 'White', 'come', 'end', 'young', 'seer', 'become', 'Bride', 'Christ', 'enters', 'convent', 'dedicate', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'live', 'rest', 'life', 'nun', 'film', 'deals', 'Bernadette', 'life', 'convent', 'walls', 'non-Catholic', 'viewers', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'film', 'rather', 'slow', 'mundane', 'very', 'life', 'nun', 'one', 'prayer', 'humility', 'self-sacrifice', 'do', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'entertaining', 'cinematic', 'format.Having', 'said', 'still', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'saint-in-training', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Sydney', 'Penny', 'more', 'worthy', 'watch', 'two', 'Catholics', 'seekers', 'alike']",N/A

Ross ""Upcoming author""","[8, 10]","I was delighted to discover that there was a followup to the first Bernadette movie with Sydney Penney, so I immediately ordered it.  But as I watched it, I noticed some very odd and unfortunate alterations in the film.  For anyone who'd watched the first movie and became familiar with the characters, seeing some of the same actors in the second film was disconcerting hearing them speak with someone else's voice. Nowhere is this more bizarre than hearing Sydney Penney have someone else speak her English lines, something she could have easily done, being an American. While this didn't ruin the film, it just wasn't the same.  I've been acquainted with much of Sydney Penney's work since she was a child.  As she blossomed into a young woman, she had a slightly deep, melodic voice.  Whoever did the voice-over for her in this film had a high, squeaky voice---most unpleasant.  It was a poor judgment call on the makers of the second film.  The film itself might have gotten an ""A"", but the questionable voice-overs lower it to a ""C"", which is why I only gave it three stars.",3,Lost In Translation.,1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,1080,"['was', 'delighted', 'discover', 'was', 'followup', 'first', 'Bernadette', 'movie', 'Sydney', 'Penney', 'immediately', 'ordered', 'watched', 'noticed', 'very', 'odd', 'unfortunate', 'alterations', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', ""'d"", 'watched', 'first', 'movie', 'became', 'familiar', 'characters', 'seeing', 'same', 'actors', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'disconcerting', 'hearing', 'speak', 'someone', 'else', 'voice', 'more', 'bizarre', 'hearing', 'Sydney', 'Penney', 'have', 'someone', 'else', 'English', 'lines', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'done', 'being', 'American', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'film', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', ""'ve"", 'been', 'acquainted', 'much', 'Sydney', 'Penney', 'work', 'was', 'child', 'blossomed', 'young', 'woman', 'had', 'slightly', 'deep', 'melodic', 'voice', 'did', 'voice-over', 'film', 'had', 'high', 'squeaky', 'voice', '-most', 'unpleasant', 'was', 'poor', 'judgment', 'call', 'makers', 'second', 'film', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'gotten', 'A', 'questionable', 'voice-overs', 'lower', 'C', 'why', 'only', 'gave', 'three', 'stars']",N/A
