1375976,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B003Y7TJXA,A. Gammill,"[11, 12]","I'm not sure why this series has pretty much been forgotten.  It was a legitimate attempt to continue the Robocop universe, just on a smaller scale.  Sure, it's a t.v. series and you won't get Paul Vehoeven's penchant for ultra-violence, so prevalent in the original film.  You also don't get Irwin Kershner's disregard for character development (Robocop 2) or anything as stupid as a robot ninja (Robocop 3).  In fact, if you ignore those 2 sequels, the feature-length series pilot here serves as a decent sequel.  It was even written by the writers of the original film.Some have lamented the tone-downed violence, a necessary concession for television standards.  But really, if all you got out of the original film was a robot ""Dirty Harry"" blowing away the bad guys, you missed a lot.  Like some biting satire and first-rate science fiction...both of which are present in this series.  Production values are generally good, although Delta City's CGI backdrops haven't aged well.  Richard Eden is fine as Robocop, and gets adequate support from the rest of the cast (whatever happened to Andrea Roth, who plays Diana?).As others have noted, the only real drawback to this set is some of the worst packaging ever devised.  Two sets of 3 discs are staggered in a cheap plastic holder which broke the minute I took out the first disc.  With all the options available for storage these days, there's really no excuse for it.  Paramount, for example, manages to get 6-disc full-season sets of shows in a standard size DVD case, with no discs touching each other and individual hubs for each disc.If you missed this one--and chances are pretty good you did--but enjoy the fictional future Detroit envisioned by Robocop's creators, give this show a try.  I think you'll find it isn't all that different from the original film in a lot of ways.",4,Underrated series looks great despite horrible packaging,1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,1840,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'been', 'forgotten', 'was', 'legitimate', 'attempt', 'continue', 'Robocop', 'universe', 'just', 'smaller', 'scale', 'Sure', 't.v', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'Paul', 'Vehoeven', 'penchant', 'ultra-violence', 'so', 'prevalent', 'original', 'film', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Irwin', 'Kershner', 'disregard', 'character', 'development', 'Robocop', '2', 'anything', 'as', 'stupid', 'robot', 'ninja', 'Robocop', '3', 'fact', 'ignore', '2', 'sequels', 'feature-length', 'series', 'pilot', 'here', 'decent', 'sequel', 'was', 'even', 'written', 'writers', 'original', 'film.Some', 'have', 'lamented', 'tone-downed', 'violence', 'necessary', 'concession', 'television', 'standards', 'really', 'got', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'robot', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'blowing', 'away', 'bad', 'guys', 'missed', 'lot', 'biting', 'satire', 'first-rate', 'science', 'fiction', 'are', 'present', 'series', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'generally', 'good', 'Delta', 'City', 'CGI', 'backdrops', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well', 'Richard', 'Eden', 'fine', 'Robocop', 'adequate', 'support', 'rest', 'cast', 'happened', 'Andrea', 'Roth', 'who', 'Diana', '.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'only', 'real', 'drawback', 'set', 'worst', 'packaging', 'ever', 'devised', 'Two', 'sets', '3', 'discs', 'are', 'staggered', 'cheap', 'plastic', 'holder', 'broke', 'minute', 'took', 'out', 'first', 'disc', 'options', 'available', 'storage', 'days', 'really', 'excuse', 'Paramount', 'example', 'get', '6-disc', 'full-season', 'sets', 'shows', 'standard', 'size', 'DVD', 'case', 'discs', 'touching', 'other', 'individual', 'hubs', 'disc.If', 'missed', 'one', 'chances', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', 'enjoy', 'fictional', 'future', 'Detroit', 'envisioned', 'Robocop', 'creators', 'give', 'show', 'try', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', ""n't"", 'different', 'original', 'film', 'lot', 'ways']",RoboCop: The Beginning - The Complete Series

1375978,A26BRNNAE52EOL,B003Y7TJXA,Hulk11,"[4, 4]","I loved this series when it was on. I taped them in the 90s and watched them over and over again. Of course I took breaks 6 or 12 months. The sound and picture are awsome. although I didn't like RoboCop 3 that much, this is much improved. I liked the prime directives as well. The Alpha Commando cartoon was awful and an insult to the robocop universe. I used to watch this with Time Trax, {Where is that?} and Star Trek: TNG, DS9. It's nice to have the series on dvd and fits into the sci-fi tv universe really well. So get this and all RoboCop fans would enjoy this. The only thing I didn't like is the packaging. That was AWFUL. I have to keep the discs in white sleeves to keep them from getting scratched and trashed. Up top of all that my Disc 1 doesn't work. I agree with the other reviewer who said it takes 2 much effort to get a working set of this show. I'll just keep what I got and wait for the US release. By the way WHERE IS TIME TRAX?Well I have an update, I just bought it again and it seems to work OK for now anyway. I also got it in defferent packageing. It came in a flip case like the Mannix sets come in. The discs work good so far and they look in good shape and not scratched. I don't know how I lucked into this packaging, but I;m glad I did. I don't know what advice to give on this set to purchase.",5,"Loved this Show, Awful Packaging!",1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,1326,"['loved', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'taped', '90s', 'watched', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'course', 'took', 'breaks', '6', '12', 'months', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'awsome', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'RoboCop', '3', 'much', 'much', 'improved', 'liked', 'prime', 'directives', 'as', 'well', 'Alpha', 'Commando', 'cartoon', 'was', 'awful', 'insult', 'robocop', 'universe', 'used', 'watch', 'Time', 'Trax', 'Where', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TNG', 'DS9', 'nice', 'have', 'series', 'dvd', 'sci-fi', 'tv', 'universe', 'really', 'well', 'So', 'get', 'RoboCop', 'fans', 'would', 'enjoy', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'packaging', 'was', 'AWFUL', 'have', 'keep', 'discs', 'white', 'sleeves', 'keep', 'getting', 'scratched', 'trashed', 'top', 'Disc', '1', ""n't"", 'work', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', '2', 'much', 'effort', 'get', 'working', 'set', 'show', ""'ll"", 'just', 'keep', 'what', 'got', 'wait', 'US', 'release', 'way', 'WHERE', 'IS', 'TIME', 'TRAX', 'Well', 'have', 'update', 'just', 'bought', 'again', 'work', 'OK', 'now', 'anyway', 'also', 'got', 'defferent', 'packageing', 'came', 'flip', 'case', 'Mannix', 'come', 'discs', 'work', 'good', 'so', 'far', 'look', 'good', 'shape', 'not', 'scratched', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'lucked', 'packaging', 'glad', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'advice', 'give', 'set', 'purchase']",RoboCop: The Beginning - The Complete Series
1375979,A19QXQ7JDNSVUG,B003Y7TJXA,JDTX,"[1, 1]",I would not recommend this set to anyone. The case is cheap and the little plastic clips will not hold the discs in place.

Think Robocop 3 with less plot and no action. I'm not saying don't get this series but be prepared for the worst and you will do ok. The ghost ( that's right a ghost) that helps Robocop was a silly idea.

1375981,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B003Y7TJXA,The Cool Guy,"[1, 1]","Everyone is talking about the horrible packaging for this. I guess I lucked out because the version I just bought has good packaging.It came in a standard size DVD case with a cardboard sleeve on the outside. When you open it, there are 6 disks. The one I got has 2 plastic leaves inside. A disk fits into each side of the inside covers, and one front and back on each leaf.The disks in mine did not arrive loose, and there weren't any scratches on any of them. So it looks like they fixed the packaging. But since this item is actually out of print and is only offered through Amazon marketplace sellers, there's unfortunately no guarantee which version you will get if you order this! (If it helps any, the seller I used was ""kylakins"".)As for the show itself, I like it. It is dark and moody. Not that violent, but this was before much of that was allowed on network TV so what can you do? This show is very much a child of the 80's, product of the 90's. And so am I, so I'm okay with that!It is getting more expensive and harder to find these days. The good thing about Amazon is their customer service absolutely rocks if you ever have a problem with your order and need to return something.

1375982,AV9ZTZQ05PE7N,B003Y7TJXA,THE MASTER,"[0, 0]",Low rating mostlh based on cheap packaging. My discs had popped out of the cheap case and were loose and scuffed. I read the packaging had been fixed..this is not true. Have to check the discs to see if they play..... As for the content.. Gotten thru to disk 2.. Video on the later episodes get very dark..i had to crank up the brightness to see the inside shots... Comment on show... This show should be called depressed robocop... Thats the only emotion he has... That plus the fact he never shoots anyone ..makes for an odd show... He points his gun a lot...shoots boxes...cables..stairs...but never the bad guys... Mostly he tells them that they are under arrest and then they run away..still nice to have more robo content and it is way better that the prime directive miniseries,2,Discs are not secure in package,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,784,"['Low', 'rating', 'mostlh', 'based', 'cheap', 'packaging', 'discs', 'had', 'popped', 'cheap', 'case', 'were', 'loose', 'scuffed', 'read', 'packaging', 'had', 'been', 'fixed..this', 'not', 'true', 'Have', 'check', 'discs', 'see', 'play', '..', 'content..', 'Gotten', 'thru', 'disk', '2..', 'Video', 'later', 'get', 'very', 'dark..i', 'had', 'crank', 'up', 'brightness', 'see', 'inside', 'shots', 'Comment', 'show', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'depressed', 'robocop', 'only', 'emotion', 'fact', 'never', 'shoots', 'anyone', '..makes', 'odd', 'show', 'gun', 'lot', 'shoots', 'boxes', 'cables..stairs', 'never', 'bad', 'guys', 'Mostly', 'are', 'arrest', 'then', 'run', 'away..still', 'nice', 'have', 'more', 'robo', 'content', 'way', 'better', 'prime', 'directive', 'miniseries']",RoboCop: The Beginning - The Complete Series
