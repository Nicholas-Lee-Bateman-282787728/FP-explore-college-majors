187137,AGEIT17HENDIS,1572523328,Alfred Johnson,"[6, 7]","I know Jack Kerouac. Oh no, not the way his many ""beat"" writer friends did , at least those still alive at the time of this film's production in 1986 that provided the main ""talking head"" commentary. Gregory Corso (then still a madman of a poet in his own right as shown here in his answers to an interviewer's questions about his take on the great Kerouac's demise), William Burroughs (of ""Naked Lunch"" fame) and super-poet Allen Ginsberg (of ""Howl"" and ""Kaddish"" fame) among others knew him back on those lonely, down-at-the heel, provocative post-World War II New York streets. That is the stuff of legend and well before my time, although I heard the echoes of that struggle in my own youthful efforts to break out of the straightjacket of the 1950s when my time came in the 1960s.Nor do I know Jack Keroauc from being a latter-day devotee of his spontaneous prose writing style or his standoffish, sideline view of life and consciously apolitical lifestyle, as is embarrassingly emphasized here in a famous segment on William F. Buckley's ""Firing Line"" public television show where he went out of his boozy way to dump on the counter-cultural movement (""hippies"", okay) of the 1960s. From early on in my youth I was more likely to be immersed in reading things like ""The Communist Manifesto"" (if only to dismiss it out of hand-then) and had no time for reading a ""beat"" travelogue like ""On The Road"" although I was personally struggling along those same lines to `find myself' (sound familiar ?) . Later I would devour the thing (repeatedly) along with the rest of his major works like ""Dharma Bums', Visions Of Cody"". ""Big Sur"", ""Doctor Sax"" and others.Here is how I do know Jack Kerouac. I know, like Kerouac did as well, as a youth painfully but now with a sense of deep pride, what being from the lower edges of the working class was all about. One does not easily shake off the slow incremental deathblows to the psyche of avoiding authority, avoiding challenges to the status quo, avoiding failure by being a non-starter and most of all avoiding negative public (read neighborhood) notice. I, moreover, know, physically and emotionally, the very constricted ethos of the old time New England mill towns and the working class quarters of Manchester, New Hampshire, Saco, Maine and in Massachusetts Waltham, Lawrence, Quincy and Jack's own beloved mill town of Lowell. Without going into great detail, after all this review is about Kerouac, I know in great personal detail the effects of that clannish French-Canadian and Gallic Catholic cultural gradient as it worked it way through the working class base of many of those mill towns. Some of that detailed knowledge of mine is directly linked to the city of Lowell that factors so much into Kerouac's life and writings (and death, the city has a small urban park named after him in the center of town and people, I am told, still go to visit his grave there).Most of all, though, I know Jack Kerouac because a generation, more or less, after him I was, like a million others who formed the ""Generation of `68"", taking to the `road', some road, in search of personal destiny, greater consciousness, some political wisdom, the truth or just trying to get out of the family house. The previously disdained apolitical ""On The Road"" became something of a personal bible for me , as like Whitman before him Kerouac tried to do by interior monologue, but more importantly, by physically putting some space between the here of whatever was bothering him and the there of some inner peace (that he, at least, never found). The road I took then, or later, was not Jack's road. Or Dean Moriarty's road. But, thanks Jack for ""On The Road"", ""The Dharma Bums"", ""Doctor Sax"", ""Visions of Cody"" and a bunch of other books that got me through many a sleepless night.But enough of that. We are, after, all reviewing a documentary that has as it underlying premise an analysis of Kerouac's retreat to the sidelines (which is the reason that word forms part of the headline for this entry), as ""king of the beats"" writer and as something more than a conveniently symbolic media celebrity. This one and one half hour production goes through the main events of Kerouac's life: the driven handsome athletic youth; the star-struck and searching Columbia University student: the budding frenetic writer who, luckily, very luckily I would say, met some kindred spirits like Allen Ginsberg, the ""drugstore cowboy"" William Burroughs, and a host of others in New York City in the mid-1940s and never looked back. Critically important also are the subsequent travels west hitching up with Neal Cassidy (the model for Dean Moriarty), Gary Snyder, Gregory Corso and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.However, as many of the commentators in the documentary attest to, it was always about the writing for Jack, that compulsive need to put out as many ideas as his hand (or typewriter) could produce before exhaustion set in. That, ominously, meant keeping it fresh, keeping it real under the ""laws"" the spontaneous writing method. Once Keroauc got some notice, in short, when ""On The Road"" finally got published, and he, for good or evil, fell into the clutches of the great media maw of that day (nothing, by the way, from what appeared in this film compared to today's 24/7 blitz that would have really done him in earlier) he began to decline.As media-proclaimed `leader' of the ""beats"" (and, in retrospect, he really was the most talented and original of the lot) all those old time mill town anxieties, drawing on generations of suffering ignoble anonymity, the wheels, driven as well by that old devil alcohol , came off. The effects of that cloistered, repressed working class youth, as surely as if he had spent thirty years in the mills, began to take its toll. Moreover, a recent re-reading of some of ""Dharma Bums"" gives at least some clue to what happened to this superior and innovative writer. He was, as the work that is remembered today will attest to, a young writer writing for the young about youthful experiences. There is only so much fresh inner-directed material that that market can absorb from one writer. The aging media celebrity Kerouac became, sadly, could not, or would not, face the fact of aging and shift gears. I have already given my kudos above for the youthful work of his. That will have to do here.Note: For those who never heard, or hear, the `beat' of the ""beats"" the whole mood of this documentary puts you in a time capsule back to those times musically with some very evocative jazz of the period and visually with great footage of post-war neon lit New York and San Francisco (as well as footage from hometown Lowell with some street scenes of old time residents that only add to some of my points made above). Best of all are the segments of Kerouac reading from ""On The Road"" and other materials. They evoke the feeling of some smoky, boozy nightspot. These works were, after all, written under the sign of the burgeoning 1940s and 1950s jazz scene and with the idea of presenting the works orally as well as on the page. Nice, especially one segment with 1950s comedian and talk show host Steve Allen on piano.",5,"""On The Road"" And On The Sidelines",1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,7174,"['know', 'Jack', 'Kerouac',

187138,A1D6DFC3AGV3JZ,1572523328,Andrew Parodi,"[7, 9]","Strange for me to say that this made me fall in love with Jack Kerouac, because that's sort of egotistical because I realize that, aside from the alcoholism, he and I dealt with some similar issues. Watching the footage of Jack Kerouac reading his work, I felt instinctively that there was a deep aspect of himself that related to me. I'm not saying I'm anywhere nearly as talented of a writer as he was. I'm not delusional. I just felt that I was almost watching footage of myself, his mannerisms, his expressions, his face even. I have been told I bear a slight resemblance to him. Perhaps not too surprising because he was of French-Canadian descent and I descend from a region of Italy that at one point was part of France.Anyway, in an attempt to make this review at least a little helpful to someone besides myself, I will say that it's excellent. It's not at all clinical, like some documentaries can be. It is very informal and gives you a sense of sitting and personally talking with the people who knew Jack Kerouac. And, as others have said, those who knew him do not at all come across as being in awe of him and, thankfully, they are not attempting to canonize him or make him in to an icon. If anything, they make it obvious that he was a very tortured man, like many writers I suppose, held on to his sanity merely through his writing. Actually, his daughter says that. The first time she met him he was already toward the end of his life, a drunk, and he was sitting in a chair watching the Beverly Hillbillies. She says he had few words because ""I suppose the only way his feelings came out was through his writing.""Probably the most startling revelation to come from this video is that Jack Kerouac, the man whose writing inspired the hippie generation, considered himself a conservative Republican Catholic. In footage of his 1969 interview with William Buckley, Kerouac indicates that he supported the US war in Vietnam. Later in the Buckley program, Kerouac scolds a young hippie by saying, ""You make yourself famous by protesting. 'Down with this, down with that.' I made myself famous by writing."" It's really amazing footage because the young hippie defers to Kerouac, saying, ""Well, you're a great poet. In fact it's your fault...."" The clip cuts off before the young hippie explains what he faults Kerouac for, but I think we all know what he was going to say. The exchange between Kerouac and the young hippie comes across as the exchange between a father and his misbehaving son. Ironic, because it was Kerouac himself who was is so drunk that he is almost falling out of his chair.Toward the end of the video, Kerouac's priest says that Kerouac lived like a monk and was actually a mystic. Kerouac, says the priest, didn't fear going to hell. He feared going to heaven.",5,Made me fall in love with Jack Kerouac,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,2798,"['Strange', 'say', 'made', 'fall', 'love', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'sort', 'egotistical', 'realize', 'aside', 'alcoholism', 'dealt', 'similar', 'issues', 'Watching', 'footage', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'reading', 'work', 'felt', 'instinctively', 'was', 'deep', 'aspect', 'related', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""'m"", 'anywhere', 'nearly', 'talented', 'writer', 'was', ""'m"", 'not', 'delusional', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'almost', 'watching', 'footage', 'mannerisms', 'expressions', 'face', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'bear', 'slight', 'resemblance', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'was', 'French-Canadian', 'descent', 'descend', 'region', 'Italy', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'part', 'France.Anyway', 'attempt', 'make', 'review', 'least', 'little', 'helpful', 'someone', 'besides', 'will', 'say', 'excellent', 'not', 'clinical', 'documentaries', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'informal', 'sense', 'sitting', 'personally', 'talking', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'who', 'knew', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'being', 'awe', 'thankfully', 'are', 'not', 'attempting', 'canonize', 'make', 'icon', 'anything', 'make', 'obvious', 'was', 'very', 'tortured', 'man', 'many', 'writers', 'suppose', 'held', 'sanity', 'merely', 'writing', 'Actually', 'daughter', 'first', 'time', 'met', 'was', 'already', 'end', 'life', 'drunk', 'was', 'sitting', 'chair', 'watching', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'had', 'few', 'words', 'suppose', 'only', 'way', 'feelings', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'writing', 'Probably', 'most', 'startling', 'revelation', 'come', 'video', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'man', 'writing', 'inspired', 'hippie', 'generation', 'considered', 'conservative', 'Republican', 'Catholic', 'footage', '1969', 'interview', 'William', 'Buckley', 'Kerouac', 'supported', 'US', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'Later', 'Buckley', 'program', 'Kerouac', 'young', 'hippie', 'saying', 'make', 'famous', 'protesting', ""'Down"", 'down', 'made', 'famous', 'writing', 'really', 'amazing', 'footage', 'young', 'hippie', 'defers', 'Kerouac', 'saying', 'Well', ""'re"", 'great', 'poet', 'fact', 'fault', 'clip', 'cuts', 'off', 'young', 'hippie', 'what', 'faults', 'Kerouac', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'exchange', 'Kerouac', 'young', 'hippie', 'exchange', 'father', 'misbehaving', 'son', 'Ironic', 'was', 'Kerouac', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'drunk', 'almost', 'falling', 'chair.Toward', 'end', 'video', 'Kerouac', 'priest', 'Kerouac', 'lived', 'monk', 'was', 'actually', 'mystic', 'Kerouac', 'priest', 'did', ""n't"", 'fear', 'going', 'hell', 'feared', 'going', 'heaven']",What Happened to Kerouac?

187143,A4TVX5141Y2TG,1572523328,"Douglas Groothuis ""Douglas Groothuis""","[14, 45]","""What Ever Happened to Kerouac?"" is a documentary now available on DVD about sporadic creativity enshrouded in decadence, degeneracy, and decay.  It impressionistically recounts the adult life of Jack Kerouac (1922-1969), the literary beat of the ""beat generation.""The ""Beats"" (circa 1948-1960?) are sometimes cast as proto-hippies:  Bohemian; anti-establishment; aflame with the exotic and taboo; worshippers at the Dionysian fount of creativity; nonconformists-now nihilist, now visionary; poets of the absurd and the profound; idolizers of Charlie Parker's jazz.  Theirs was gut-existentialism and ""Beat Zen,"" Hindu cosmology and nuclear eschatology.  ""To be Beat,"" wrote Kerouac, ""was to be at the bottom of your personality looking up.""  Beat was birthed by the misfits, the downbeat, the offbeat-not by the poor urchins who could manage no more than sleeping in parks and begging money, but by the artistic urchins who gave a voice to their rebellion and (somehow) got published.Kerouac was arguably magnificent at times-churning out rambling, but poetic prose-despite the fact that he was dubbed by one of the literati as ""a Neanderthal with a typewriter.""  The film is appropriate punctuated by Kerouac reading chunks of prose on ""The Steve Allen Show.""  Kerouac's work was impassioned and original; he invented a genre of continuous, spontaneous narrative seen in novels such as ""The Dharma Bums"" and ""On the Road"" which was written at high speed on a continuous sheet of paper a hundred feet long.  Beat poet Allen Ginsburg called it ""a magnificent single paragraph several blocks long.""But Kerouac burned bright but briefly, then burned out rapidly, because being Beat meant being a rogue.  As the interviews with family, friends, and acquaintances make plain, Kerouac was a drunk (who drank himself to death), an adulterer, a drug user, and a buddy of more of the same misfits of the day such as William Burroughs (homosexual and junkie), Allen Ginsberg (homosexual and sometimes psychotic), and other assorted thieves, dopers, and thrill-seekers.But decadence was heralded as transcendence and orgies as oracular.  Cultural critic Carl Raschke notes that ""Kerouac was self-consciously attempting to depict the whirl of sensation as the key to cosmic understanding, as a vehicle of liberation:  though he left little distinction between the liberation of the mind and libertinism of the youthful rake and rebel.""Decadence was avant-garde, and was touted as the engine of artistry.  But the gaunt, sour, bitter faces of many of his now aged or recently deceased compatriots reveal that debauchery indeed debauches-even debauches the Beats, and especially Kerouac.  Handsome, lithe, and vigorous as a young man, middle age found him to be bloated and beaten beat.Particularly pathetic are short clips of William F. Buckley's ""Firing Line"" in 1969.  Buckley presided over the intellectual debris of a quasi-incoherent Kerouac who was asked to consider the relationship between Beats and Hippies.  An unflappable Buckley gracefully withstood Kerouac's juvenile ramblings, seeking to bring coherence out of chaos.  Buckley smiled knowingly.  Kerouac smirked contemptuously-an appropriate Beat response, perhaps.  A rummied out rebel without a cause met a conservative rebel with a cause.  The juxtaposition was telling, almost painful.Kerouac at his best may have unmasked some of the pretensions of a complacent, self-righteous, post-war America; he may have celebrated elements of life-such as bebop jazz-that were unjustly ignored by others.  But he exacted too high a price.  By going ""on the road"" he deserted the Protestant work ethic that undergirds a productive and healthy culture, exchanging postponed gratification for immediate gratification (and addiction), exchanging hard work for protracted play-and encouraged others to follow suit.  His promiscuity denied the sanctity of the family.  (We see several clips of his abandoned daughter reflecting on her father's life.)  But Kerouac and friends corrupted more than themselves; they inspired a whole counterculture-as William Burroughs notes in the film-that both amplified and refined the Beat spirit of nonconformity, hedonism, and Eastern religious intrigue.  And don't we even hear something of ""the beat"" in the punks?The film reports that Kerouac said that because he was a Catholic he couldn't commit suicide, so he decided to drink himself to death (which is really gradual suicide).  Although his prose drew inspiration eclectically from Buddhism, Hinduism, and just about anywhere-Beat was nothing if not unsystematic-several friends and his priest tell us that Kerouac was entranced by the crucifix, and painted pictures of Christ and cardinals toward the end.  Yet no conversion was evident-only an alcoholic's eroded body, mind, and soul.  It seemed he never caught the spirit of the one he could not forget.  Jesus said ""seek and you shall find.""  Jack Kerouac must have been looking in all the wrong places.",3,"Interesting, but sad, tale of a largely wasted talent.",1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,4993,"['What', 'Ever', 'Happened', 'Kerouac',

187147,A3KIMY5N7J3F75,1572523328,"Michael K. Hall ""ubikpkd""","[25, 26]","I think there are two types of successful documentaries.  Great films regardless of subject matter (ie: Ken Burns work, Woodstock, Errol Morris's films) and documentaries that exist because of their subject matter (most of Michael Moore's films, Supersize Me, almost every musician or film star doc). This second group does not necessarily need to be a work of art to be successful.  If you're a fan of the subject, you'll almost inevitably like the film.For me, this film falls into the 2nd category.  Obviously the subject matter is a no brainer.  Most of Kerouac's contemporaries were still alive.  His daughter and ex's talked on camera.  Lots of footage of Jack himself (looking sharp and at his peak with Steve Allen; drunk, sad and near-death with Buckley). There is also lots of photos and audio of Jack with friends, fellow poets and contemporaries. I'm sure the filmmakers had to whittle down their footage to a managable length.Another way to judge a documentary is to ask the question: What if I don't know anything about the subject? What portrait does it paint?  Does it make me want to seek out more info on this person, read their books, watch their films, etc.I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I knew very little about Kerouac before watching the film.  I gravitated more to the work of Charles Bukowski, which some feel (I don't) was part of the Beat movement.  I knew about Kerouac and had thumbed through a couple of his books; I'd even read some of his contemporaries - a little Ginsberg - a lot of William Burroughs.  But knowing little definitely qualifies me to say, yes, the film is very successful in presenting its subject in interesting ways.  I will now have to dig out a copy of On The Road!  What better complement can you give a movie of any kind!The movie itself moves quickly. It has a great score (that is mostly jazz from Thelonious Monk with a little Charlie Parker) and all of the interviews are fascinating.  It lacks a certain style that would have made it a great film, but the subject matter more than makes up for it.  I believe that fans as well as the ignorant (me included) have an equal chance of enjoying the film.Unfortunately there are no extra features (other than a trailer - not for this film).  If any film seemed to cry out for extended interviews, complete segments featuring Kerouac or commentary from the filmmakers and even some of the personalities featured on film, this film certainly does!  Perhaps its the age of the film (about 20 years) that prevented that type of material?

187150,A14ADG0TTI4XBV,1572523328,"Scott Coblio ""kookoo guy""","[5, 5]","I got into Kerouac by way of my interest in Neal Cassady, whom I can't really remember how I discovered. (I have yet to read ""On the Road"" but am familiar with Jack's prose style through spoken word recordings.)  Anyway, I came to this doc more from an interest in the person than his work, which I think is common to a lot of people who love the Beats. Their personas are as much a part of their legend as anything they wrote.That said, Jack looks like a troubled boy even in his best clips here, which are undoubtedly the earlier ones on the Steve Allen Show--probably in part because he was in what he perceived to be a sympathetic environment and therefore felt at liberty to indulge his playful and vulnerable side. He is in fact most touching as he reads excerpts from ""On the Road"". He is also a ruggedly handsome and charismatic figure, although his tendency for brooding and blustering is apparent even here. Far less flattering is his appearance on a later talk show, aptly titled ""Firing Line"" in which ,visibly drunk, he (understandably) reacts defensively and plays the fool to host William Buckley's cross examiner. This was only a year and a half before Jack's premature death from alcoholism, and he seems too beleagured with complexes to get out anything coherent. He seems to be trapped in a subjective hell wherein he believes everything and everyone to be part of some ""organized effort to ignore him"".As a younger man however, his appeal--both personal and literary-- is obvious. He got American literature out of its stodgy rut,  writing in bold, Hemingway-like strokes, blending narrative fiction with poetry off the top of his head in what was to be called ""spontaneous prose"". As one of his contemporaries points out in the interviews, this was a wildly adventurous choice to make in the fifties/sixties, from a man who could ""write any way you want"" but chose the road less travelled because that's where his passion was.Neal Cassady is seen briefly in a clip filmed at A Different Light Bookstore, San Francisco in 1965. He appears with Allen Ginsberg, who is clearly enamored of him. Neal, as everyone knows, was Jack's muse/alter ego, the inspiration for the character of Dean Moriarty in ""On the Road"", and--according to many of his contemporaries--a kind of genius in his own right. However, nothing he says in this clip made any sense to me at all--and even Ginsberg seems at a loss to communicate with him. He too seems lost in his own head, trapped in some internal dialogue with himself.  Still, it's easy to see how he could draw people in and inspire them. He had that alpha energy that makes things go. Mix it with good looks and charisma and you've got a cult! The cult of Neal. I think in some ways Jack was brooding because he wasn't Neal. Neal was the doer, and Jack was the observer/commentator, and one can never be the other, although each usually longs to be.Carolyn Cassady--Neal's wife of 20 years, is unexpectedly good-humored and funny to listen to. Poor Carolyn was--for awhile, at least-- the anchor that kept Neal from floating into the outer stratospheres. Compared to Jack and Neal, her solidity and insistence on at least an operating level of convention make her a heavy in most books about the Beats, but it's clear from this interview that she was simply SANE. Pretty even in old age, with unbelievably beautiful blue eyes that still twinkle when she reminisces on Neal and her affair with Kerouac, she proves herself humorous, resilient and every inch their intellectual equal. She must also have been remarkably patient to deal with these two exasperating egotists, not to mention sporadic sexual meddling with her husband by Ginsberg.

But it's not for a lack of interest for sure. I think the bulk of people that have seen this may have either rented it from a library or have seen it re-run on your local PBS channel. The quality of the film doesn't lend itself to the digital age very well, as the presentation of the interviews and the facts about the life of one of America's greatest writers is handled in a very film-school type of fashion.I don't mean to denigrate this documentary at all with that last statement, but the quality of the presentation is just as rough as the actual archive footage. Only the presentation can be weighed in the sense of filmmaking, but in truth it is what it is. It's not slick, it's not polished, it's not even artful like the recentBukowski Documentary, but it is fascinating, intelligent, absorbing and powerful to watch.As most may know, Jack Kerouac drank himself into the grave in the late sixties, for reasons known and unknown. The weight he carried was a significant one that pushed him as deep into himself as he could go until his inner body could no longer sustain him. A lot of the troubled history of Kerouac is fleshed out as well as his stomping grounds, his old lovers, his daughter, some of his friends and other contemporaries.The interview with Gregory Corso is a fascinating one to say the least and one can understand why the man decided to turn to teaching literature. The way he tells the stories and the stories themselves are powerful in his hands as he speaks highly and respectfully of Kerouac and in way in which a true friend who never left his side would.This is a very touching and personal, albeit rough, look into the life and times of one of America's most compelling writers of the last age.  While you may complain about the unmastered archive footage, you'll be amazed at the segment with Steve Allen, the interview with William F. Buckley, where Jack is drunk on air, and so on.This is a very enjoyable and well worth the time spent.... ...",5,Kerouac Raw ...,1226361600,"11 11, 2008",2008,2082,"['Not', 'much', 'exists', 'way', 'documentaries', 'father', 'Beat', 'Generation', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'not', 'lack', 'interest', 'sure', 'think', 'bulk', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'may', 'have', 'rented', 'library', 'have', 'seen', 're-run', 'local', 'PBS', 'channel', 'quality', 'film', ""n't"", 'lend', 'digital', 'age', 'very', 'well', 'presentation', 'interviews', 'facts', 'life', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'writers', 'handled', 'very', 'film-school', 'type', 'fashion.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'denigrate', 'documentary', 'last', 'statement', 'quality', 'presentation', 'just', 'as', 'rough', 'actual', 'archive', 'footage', 'Only', 'presentation', 'can', 'be', 'weighed', 'sense', 'filmmaking', 'truth', 'what', 'not', 'slick', 'not', 'polished', 'not', 'even', 'artful', 'recentBukowski', 'Documentary', 'fascinating', 'intelligent', 'absorbing', 'powerful', 'watch.As', 'most', 'may', 'know', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'drank', 'grave', 'late', 'sixties', 'reasons', 'known', 'unknown', 'weight', 'carried', 'was', 'significant', 'one', 'pushed', 'deep', 'could', 'go', 'inner', 'body', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'sustain', 'lot', 'troubled', 'history', 'Kerouac', 'fleshed', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'stomping', 'grounds', 'old', 'lovers', 'daughter', 'friends', 'other', 'contemporaries.The', 'interview', 'Gregory', 'Corso', 'fascinating', 'one', 'say', 'least', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'man', 'decided', 'turn', 'teaching', 'literature', 'way', 'stories', 'stories', 'are', 'powerful', 'hands', 'highly', 'respectfully', 'Kerouac', 'way', 'true', 'friend', 'who', 'never', 'left', 'side', 'would.This', 'very', 'touching', 'personal', 'albeit', 'rough', 'look', 'life', 'times', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'compelling', 'writers', 'last', 'age', 'may', 'complain', 'unmastered', 'archive', 'footage', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed', 'segment', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'interview', 'William', 'F.', 'Buckley', 'where', 'Jack', 'drunk', 'air', 'so', 'on.This', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'time', 'spent']",What Happened to Kerouac?

187152,A25TJD77EBERPD,1572523328,The Concise Critic:,"[3, 4]","I'm not a fan of Jack Kerouac. . .yet.I was disappointed, and I tried hard not to be, reading ""On the Road"". I found myself agreeing, and I tried hard not to, with Truman Capote who said Kerouac didn't write, he typed.This film has made me give Kerouac another chance. (Will it be ""Big Sur"" or ""Doctor Sax"" or ""Tristessa""?) This excellent documentary has convinced me that Kerouac was more than a drunk (Even though one of the most interesting scenes has a drunken Kerouac telling William F. Buckley to hurry the question up.) and more than a typist (There were scenes where excerpts of Kerouac's stuff--other than ""On the Road""--were read during photo montages, first, of big city life and, later, of Lowell, MA.)The film also shows how literate, articulate, and compassionate these original beatniks were. How can one listen to Allen Ginsberg here and not be impressed with his warmth and his storytelling, regardless of what one thinks of his persona or his poetry? These beatniks were not just a group of young adults in the 1940's fueled by chemicals and hormones. There really was (perhaps only at times) a seeking for spirit and beauty and truth.May I correctly select, from Kerouac's other works, my next beat experience.",5,I'll go on the road again,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,1229,"[""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', '.yet.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'tried', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'reading', 'Road', 'found', 'agreeing', 'tried', 'hard', 'not', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'who', 'said', 'Kerouac', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'film', 'made', 'give', 'Kerouac', 'chance', 'be', 'Big', 'Sur', 'Doctor', 'Sax', 'Tristessa', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'convinced', 'Kerouac', 'was', 'more', 'drunk', 'Even', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'drunken', 'Kerouac', 'telling', 'William', 'F.', 'Buckley', 'hurry', 'question', 'up', 'more', 'typist', 'were', 'scenes', 'where', 'excerpts', 'Kerouac', 'stuff', 'other', 'Road', 'were', 'read', 'photo', 'montages', 'first', 'big', 'city', 'life', 'later', 'Lowell', 'MA', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'literate', 'articulate', 'compassionate', 'original', 'beatniks', 'were', 'How', 'can', 'one', 'listen', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'here', 'not', 'be', 'impressed', 'warmth', 'storytelling', 'regardless', 'what', 'one', 'persona', 'poetry', 'beatniks', 'were', 'not', 'just', 'group', 'young', 'adults', '1940', 'fueled', 'chemicals', 'hormones', 'really', 'was', 'perhaps', 'only', 'times', 'seeking', 'spirit', 'beauty', 'truth.May', 'correctly', 'select', 'Kerouac', 'other', 'works', 'next', 'beat', 'experience']",What Happened to Kerouac?

187153,A199T3IWULDX68,1572523328,"Thirty-Ought Six ""music fiend""","[0, 0]","I found this online one day browsing and since I was exposed to Jack's literary talents in my teenage years reading great works like On the Road, the Subterraneans and the Dharma Bums as well as owning his spoken word/performance records, since put together as a box set The Jack Kerouac Collection, I thought it would be a good time to grab this visual piece of history. Its a fairly good document about the man and his life with inputs from friends like Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, William Burroughs and Kerouac's daughter Jan as well and makes for an interesting insight into the eyes of what he felt and saw. Although Kerouac demurred at the title of being the leader of the &#34;Beat&#34; generation of the 1950's, it was during this period that his writings of prose began to overflow with 1st person inspiration and he possessed a style that wasn't understood for its time, but acknowledged and recognized as an innovative, creative craft, nonetheless.There is footage of him a year or so before his death that reveals a jaded, somewhat withdrawn presence on the William F. Buckley tv show wherein a seemingly intoxicated Kerouac is involved in a discussion with the host about the Vietnam war, America and government in relation to the &#34;counter-culture&#34; movement in the late 60's and he seems uneasy and irritable throughout the broadcast. There's also footage of a younger Kerouac on the Steve Allen show 8 years back from the Buckley show and it reveals a more positive side to the writer briefly allowing a glimpse into his persona and psyche. I would say, if you're a fan of Kerouac, despite this being rather old(1981, I believe), its very good to have, if nothing else, for an entertaining hour or so of your own time to spend and reminisce with if you're a devoted follower. 4 stars",4,Neat Documentary,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,1808,"['found', 'online', 'one', 'day', 'browsing', 'was', 'exposed', 'Jack', 'literary', 'talents', 'teenage', 'years', 'reading', 'great', 'works', 'Road', 'Subterraneans', 'Dharma', 'Bums', 'as', 'well', 'owning', 'spoken', 'word/performance', 'records', 'put', 'together', 'box', 'set', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'Collection', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'time', 'grab', 'visual', 'piece', 'history', 'fairly', 'good', 'document', 'man', 'life', 'inputs', 'friends', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'Gregory', 'Corso', 'William', 'Burroughs', 'Kerouac', 'daughter', 'Jan', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'insight', 'eyes', 'what', 'felt', 'saw', 'Kerouac', 'demurred', 'title', 'being', 'leader', '34', 'Beat', '34', 'generation', '1950', 'was', 'period', 'writings', 'prose', 'began', 'overflow', '1st', 'person', 'inspiration', 'possessed', 'style', 'was', ""n't"", 'understood', 'time', 'acknowledged', 'recognized', 'innovative', 'creative', 'craft', 'footage', 'year', 'so', 'death', 'jaded', 'somewhat', 'withdrawn', 'presence', 'William', 'F.', 'Buckley', 'tv', 'show', 'seemingly', 'intoxicated', 'Kerouac', 'involved', 'discussion', 'host', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'America', 'government', 'relation', '34', 'counter-culture', '34', 'movement', 'late', '60', 'uneasy', 'irritable', 'broadcast', 'also', 'footage', 'younger', 'Kerouac', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'show', '8', 'years', 'back', 'Buckley', 'show', 'more', 'positive', 'side', 'writer', 'briefly', 'allowing', 'glimpse', 'persona', 'psyche', 'would', 'say', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Kerouac', 'being', 'rather', 'old', '1981', 'believe', 'very', 'good', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'entertaining', 'hour', 'so', 'own', 'time', 'spend', 'reminisce', ""'re"", 'devoted', 'follower', '4', 'stars']",What Happened to Kerouac?
