I had reservations about watching this film for fear it would only sensationalize tragedy, but the movie produced for A & E is a thought provoking, heart breaking tale of people banding together to take back control of their destiny at a great cost. No one should even question the heroism of the passengers aboard this plane and the selflessness with which they gave their lives for their country. The stories of that tragic day are told from different passengers point of view and are beautifully portrayed by all actors involved.

But beleive me, this is one film which deserves these descriptions. From the beginning to the end I was absorbed with every detail. It was as if I was REALLY THERE.

It was clear a few of them wanted to get on with the high-jacking, but the leader remeined ice-cool waiting for the right time. If I was one of them, I would have been perspiring and cracking up. This was the real deal for them.I saw World Trade with Nicolas Cage on Saturday, and it awful in comparison with this.

980792,ADES8B01WRPI3,B000EYJHDS,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[6, 7]","FLIGHT 93 (rated PG-13) should be compared with the other film about this 9/11 flight, UNITED 93 (rated R), and in my opinion, this FLIGHT 93 is slightly better. This film is less graphically violent than the other, so it managed a PG-13 rating, while the other film shows more blood and violence. But the PG-13 rating of this FLIGHT 93 does not make it a lesser version, overall. This FLIGHT 93 has less blood but a bit more warmth and personality with deeper looks at the human relationships and elements that are part of this real life event.Both films are very realistic portrayals of this tragic, historical event in American history. UNITED 93 is better at showing more realistic sets in the Air Traffic Control locations, but this DVD, FLIGHT 93 is better at showing the scary rollercoaster flight and this FLIGHT 93 focuses on the heroic passengers better, (where UNITED 93 seems to refrain from focusing on individuals too much, unfortunately making everybody almost equally anonymous as a result, in comparison).I actually saw UNITED 93 first, and I was very impressed with it, so I was surprised after seeing this FLIGHT 93, that I liked it even better!Both films have director commentary, which is immensely informative, so be sure to watch this film at least once with the commentary turned on!There are slightly different sources used for each film, so it is interesting to see the slight differences as well as what both films have in common, especially when the details had to be speculated upon, due to lack of hard evidence. For instance, both films must speculate on the precise details of the final moments of the passenger revolt against the terrorists. Both movies feature The Lord's Prayer from the Holy Bible, but UNITED 93 has several people reciting it together, while the superior FLIGHT 93 shows Todd ""Let's Roll"" Beamer reciting it with the telephone operator on the ground, with whom Todd had been talking with during the last 17 minutes of the hijacking.Todd Beamer, perhaps the most prominently discussed passenger in the media, looks a littler older and professional, wearing a business suit in this FLIGHT 93; while UNITED 93 shows him looking and dressing younger, in a pullover shirt with bold, sporty colors, (the way I pictured him in my mind).Both films are very intense and emotional. The other film, UNITED 93, is a bit more gritty and realistic, while this FLIGHT 93 has better focus on the individual passengers and heroes of this tragic flight. UNITED 93 seems a bit more personally detached but looks more realistic, while this better FLIGHT 93 allows itself to show more of the personalized human elements of many individual passengers and the family and strangers with whom they spoke over cell phones with, from which many of the details of the events have been gleaned from.There is talk of Academy Award Oscar Nominations for the other UNITED 93, but if that film deserves the recognition, which it does, so does this FLIGHT 93, and perhaps slightly more so.Both films are highly recommended by me, but if I had to choose only one, it would be this one, FLIGHT 93!",5,Slightly Better than the More Highly Praised UNITED 93 Movie!,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,3114,"['FLIGHT', '93', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'should', 'be', 'compared', 'other', 'film', '9/11', 'flight', 'UNITED', '93', 'rated', 'R', 'opinion', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'slightly', 'better', 'film', 'less', 'graphically', 'violent', 'other', 'managed', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'other', 'film', 'shows', 'more', 'blood', 'violence', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'not', 'make', 'lesser', 'version', 'overall', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'less', 'blood', 'bit', 'more', 'warmth', 'personality', 'deeper', 'looks', 'human', 'relationships', 'elements', 'are', 'part', 'real', 'life', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'portrayals', 'tragic', 'historical', 'event', 'American', 'history', '93', 'better', 'showing', 'more', 'realistic', 'sets', 'Air', 'Traffic', 'Control', 'locations', 'DVD', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'better', 'showing', 'scary', 'rollercoaster', 'flight', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'focuses', 'heroic', 'passengers', 'better', 'where', 'UNITED', '93', 'refrain', 'focusing', 'individuals', 'too', 'much', 'unfortunately', 'making', 'everybody', 'almost', 'equally', 'anonymous', 'result', 'comparison', 'actually', 'saw', 'UNITED', '93', 'first', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'was', 'surprised', 'seeing', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'liked', 'even', 'better', 'films', 'have', 'director', 'commentary', 'immensely', 'informative', 'so', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'film', 'least', 'once', 'commentary', 'turned', 'are', 'slightly', 'different', 'sources', 'used', 'film', 'interesting', 'see', 'slight', 'differences', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'films', 'have', 'common', 'especially', 'when', 'details', 'had', 'be', 'speculated', 'due', 'lack', 'hard', 'evidence', 'instance', 'films', 'must', 'speculate', 'precise', 'details', 'final', 'moments', 'passenger', 'revolt', 'terrorists', 'movies', 'feature', 'Lord', 'Prayer', 'Holy', 'Bible', 'UNITED', '93', 'several', 'people', 'reciting', 'together', 'superior', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'shows', 'Todd', 'Let', 'Roll', 'Beamer', 'reciting', 'telephone', 'operator', 'ground', 'whom', 'Todd', 'had', 'been', 'talking', 'last', '17', 'minutes', 'hijacking.Todd', 'Beamer', 'perhaps', 'most', 'prominently', 'discussed', 'passenger', 'media', 'littler', 'older', 'professional', 'wearing', 'business', 'suit', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'UNITED', '93', 'looking', 'dressing', 'younger', 'pullover', 'shirt', 'bold', 'sporty', 'colors', 'way', 'pictured', 'mind', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'intense', 'emotional', 'other', 'film', 'UNITED', '93', 'bit', 'more', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'better', 'focus', 'individual', 'passengers', 'heroes', 'tragic', 'flight', '93', 'bit', 'more', 'personally', 'detached', 'more', 'realistic', 'better', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'show', 'more', 'personalized', 'human', 'elements', 'many', 'individual', 'passengers', 'family', 'strangers', 'whom', 'spoke', 'over', 'cell', 'phones', 'many', 'details', 'events', 'have', 'been', 'gleaned', 'from.There', 'talk', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Oscar', 'Nominations', 'other', 'UNITED', '93', 'film', 'recognition', 'so', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'more', 'so.Both', 'films', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended', 'had', 'choose', 'only', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'FLIGHT', '93']",Flight 93: The Movie

980796,A1H3S4KTB6QJ8H,B000EYJHDS,"C. Cunningham ""Cris Cunningham""","[6, 8]","I have watched this movie at least 10 times and when compared to its motion picture counterpart ""United 93"" (directed by Oliver Stone), I prefer this version hands down.I know that television movies have a reputation for being far less accurate and exciting than theatre versions, but this movie breaks the mold in a very big way. There is no fluff (as there is in ""United 93""), just good, solid performances.The dialogue appears to be amazingly accurate. I read that it was drawn from personal interviews with family members and public records.  The acting is SUPERB; very emotionally charged and downright riveting. Most of the actors are unknowns, which probably adds to the realism. (FYI- the actor who plays First Officer Leroy Homer plays the same role in ""United 93"").  My only complaint is that some of the actors did not physically resemble their real-life counterparts, not by a long-shot...but nevertheless, their performances were phenomenal. I was amazed at how good they were.As I mentioned in my ""United 93"" review, this all boils down to a matter of taste. Flight 93 focuses more on what happened on the plane with the passengers, crew and hijackers. United 93 focuses more on what happened on the ground between the different air traffic control operations and the military (which, by the way, is an excellent look at the inner workings of air traffic control and the miltary's confusion over the rules of engagement). One takes on a more technical viewpoint and the other a more personal one. The television version is of course a bit milder, but it still shines.

980797,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000EYJHDS,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[5, 14]","I might as well get this out of the way right away. ""United 93"" was my favorite film of this year thus far. Its ability to turn this event into a stunning, gut-wrenching, real experience had me leaving the theater giddy with excitement for the medium of film. Now I take on the made-for-TV version, ""Flight 93,"" which came out mere weeks before the theatrical version. Of course my expectations were fairly low, so when I didn't like it I wasn't terribly disappointed. That said this film does come screaming out of the gate, and had it been a 60 minute film as opposed to a 90 minute one I probably would have recommended it. But it is not to be as ""Flight 93"" runs out of gas, and then tries to coast across the finish line by playing into the sensibilities of their A&E; audience.The mastery Paul Greenglass had of his documentary feel in ""United 93"" isn't entirely clear until you see this film. The difference is in the details, which is exactly what ""Flight 93"" lacks. We don't see the mundane events of the air traffic control room before the attack, we don't see the terrorists agonizing over their timing, and we don't see the passengers debate how to land the plane (I hope it came up). Also, the actors move about the screen as though they were on a soundstage as opposed to a hijacked airplane. The head of the acting class here is Jeffrey Nordling who plays Tom. He actually uses facial expressions and voice inflections. The rest of the gang just wanders around as though they were auditioning for a spot on ""All My Children."" The film did, of course, get to me on some emotional level. The scenes early on of the airport the morning of gave me, who hates flying, the willies because of its sense of normalcy. This isn't a bad movie. It's an OK movie that has piggybacked itself onto a great human story.I would also point out that if we are even going to truly explore the emotional depths this story has to offer we are going to have to shed this hero worship skin we now have. Peter Markle, the director, uses every short handed trick in the book to tell us that these people were good Americans. Nearly every one of them had rugrats running around at home to enhance their good guy street cred. A fatal blow came late in the film when they decided to throw the Fox News audience some love with an extended prayer scene between Todd Beamer and his new found phone friend. We already understand that these are the good guys; still there is not a vice to be found amongst them. On 9-11 these people were clearly the good guys, no matter who they were. In ""Road to Guantanamo"" the US soldiers were clearly the bad guys, but Michael Winterbottom was smart enough to show his victims as flawed and not too bright. But remember, we hate nuance here in America. Markle takes every precaution to make sure his audience is not offended. At the same time I'm sure A&E; thought they were redefining the made-for-TV movie. OK, it's better than most, but it's also a whole lot of recycled trash. ***",3,Incredibly Inferior to United 93,1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,3003,"['might', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'right', 'away', 'United', '93', 'was', 'favorite', 'film', 'year', 'thus', 'far', 'ability', 'turn', 'event', 'stunning', 'gut-wrenching', 'real', 'experience', 'had', 'leaving', 'theater', 'giddy', 'excitement', 'medium', 'film', 'Now', 'take', 'made-for-TV', 'version', 'Flight', '93', 'came', 'out', 'mere', 'weeks', 'theatrical', 'version', 'course', 'expectations', 'were', 'fairly', 'low', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'said', 'film', 'come', 'screaming', 'gate', 'had', 'been', '60', 'minute', 'film', 'opposed', '90', 'minute', 'one', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'recommended', 'not', 'be', 'Flight', '93', 'gas', 'then', 'tries', 'coast', 'finish', 'line', 'playing', 'sensibilities', 'A', 'E', 'audience.The', 'mastery', 'Paul', 'Greenglass', 'had', 'documentary', 'feel', 'United', '93', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'clear', 'see', 'film', 'difference', 'details', 'exactly', 'what', 'Flight', '93', 'lacks', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'mundane', 'events', 'air', 'traffic', 'control', 'room', 'attack', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'terrorists', 'agonizing', 'timing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'passengers', 'debate', 'how', 'land', 'plane', 'hope', 'came', 'up', 'Also', 'actors', 'move', 'screen', 'were', 'soundstage', 'opposed', 'hijacked', 'airplane', 'head', 'acting', 'class', 'here', 'Jeffrey', 'Nordling', 'who', 'Tom', 'actually', 'facial', 'expressions', 'voice', 'inflections', 'rest', 'gang', 'just', 'wanders', 'around', 'were', 'auditioning', 'spot', 'My', 'Children', 'film', 'did', 'course', 'get', 'emotional', 'level', 'scenes', 'early', 'airport', 'morning', 'gave', 'who', 'flying', 'willies', 'sense', 'normalcy', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'OK', 'movie', 'piggybacked', 'great', 'human', 'story.I', 'would', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'are', 'even', 'going', 'truly', 'emotional', 'depths', 'story', 'offer', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'shed', 'hero', 'worship', 'skin', 'now', 'have', 'Peter', 'Markle', 'director', 'short', 'handed', 'trick', 'book', 'tell', 'people', 'were', 'good', 'Americans', 'Nearly', 'one', 'had', 'rugrats', 'running', 'around', 'home', 'enhance', 'good', 'guy', 'street', 'cred', 'A', 'fatal', 'blow', 'came', 'late', 'film', 'when', 'decided', 'throw', 'Fox', 'News', 'audience', 'love', 'extended', 'prayer', 'scene', 'Todd', 'Beamer', 'new', 'found', 'phone', 'friend', 'already', 'understand', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'still', 'not', 'vice', 'be', 'found', '9-11', 'people', 'were', 'clearly', 'good', 'guys', 'matter', 'who', 'were', 'Road', 'Guantanamo', 'US', 'soldiers', 'were', 'clearly', 'bad', 'guys', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'show', 'victims', 'flawed', 'not', 'too', 'bright', 'remember', 'hate', 'nuance', 'here', 'America', 'Markle', 'precaution', 'make', 'sure', 'audience', 'not', 'offended', 'same', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'A', 'E', 'thought', 'were', 'redefining', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'OK', 'better', 'most', 'also', 'whole', 'lot', 'recycled', 'trash', '***']",Flight 93: The Movie
980798,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000EYJHDS,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 4]","About a year after September 11, an oft-repeated question was often asked: ""where were you when you heard?"". Me personally, I was at school, in the hallways when I heard a girl saying ""they bombed the Pentagon!"" but she said it an unserious tone. Having a spare I walked home and there it was all over news websites, clicked on CNN and there it was too. I'm not one of those guys that thinks making a serious movie about an event is ""too early"". I seem to remember a JonBenet Ramsey movie somewhere, an Elian Gonzalez, the Bird flu film recently and most likely they'll be a Natalee Holloway sometime too. This is the tv movie, not the recently released film in theatres, United 93 but this one is good too.We all know the story: on September 11th 2001 early in the morning, 2 planes crashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, another hitting the Pentagon. Well there was a 4th plane that oddly didn't get as much attention that crashed in the fields, not reaching its intended target. This film tells the story of those onboard and the dilemna of trying to survive so you can go back to your family again and the realization that you won't get to.I'll admit the film got to me at times. I didn't outright break down but it sure can sober you up if you're feeling goofy. Part of this is the un-Hollywood style of the scenes. Yeah there's a scene of the passengers trying to take control of the plane but it's not done in that kind of ""I'm an ex-CIA agent and I'm quite capable of doing this stuff"". These are ordinary human beings who tried to see their families again, not a bunch of Macgyver action heroes.Now I do got a personal gripe with 9/11 and that's actually the coverage. Yes each plane suffered a massive loss of life, including those at ground zero in the tower and the firefighters who went in. Seeing the plane crash into one of the towers, thereby ending many lives in one second is quite much but then good ol' CNN shows it every 7 seconds from different angles. In a weird way, it becomes less shocking since it became so familiar but seeing this film puts it in a more personal perspective.Some will likely look to the theatrical film United 93 for the better one but this one is just as good.",5,It's quite good although still waiting how the other one is,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,2224,"['year', 'September', '11', 'oft-repeated', 'question', 'was', 'often', 'asked', 'where', 'were', 'when', 'heard', 'Me', 'personally', 'was', 'school', 'hallways', 'when', 'heard', 'girl', 'saying', 'bombed', 'Pentagon', 'said', 'unserious', 'tone', 'Having', 'spare', 'walked', 'home', 'was', 'news', 'websites', 'clicked', 'CNN', 'was', 'too', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'guys', 'making', 'serious', 'movie', 'event', 'too', 'early', 'seem', 'remember', 'JonBenet', 'Ramsey', 'movie', 'somewhere', 'Elian', 'Gonzalez', 'Bird', 'flu', 'film', 'recently', 'most', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Natalee', 'Holloway', 'sometime', 'too', 'tv', 'movie', 'not', 'recently', 'released', 'film', 'theatres', 'United', '93', 'one', 'good', 'know', 'story', 'September', '11th', '2001', 'early', 'morning', '2', 'planes', 'crashed', 'twin', 'towers', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'hitting', 'Pentagon', 'Well', 'was', '4th', 'plane', 'oddly', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'crashed', 'fields', 'not', 'reaching', 'intended', 'target', 'film', 'story', 'onboard', 'dilemna', 'trying', 'survive', 'so', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'family', 'again', 'realization', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'to.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'film', 'got', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'outright', 'break', 'down', 'sure', 'can', 'sober', 'up', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'goofy', 'Part', 'un-Hollywood', 'style', 'scenes', 'scene', 'passengers', 'trying', 'take', 'control', 'plane', 'not', 'done', 'kind', ""'m"", 'ex-CIA', 'agent', ""'m"", 'quite', 'capable', 'doing', 'stuff', 'are', 'ordinary', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'tried', 'see', 'families', 'again', 'not', 'bunch', 'Macgyver', 'action', 'heroes.Now', 'do', 'got', 'personal', 'gripe', '9/11', 'actually', 'coverage', 'Yes', 'plane', 'suffered', 'massive', 'loss', 'life', 'including', 'ground', 'zero', 'tower', 'firefighters', 'who', 'went', 'Seeing', 'plane', 'crash', 'one', 'towers', 'thereby', 'ending', 'many', 'lives', 'one', 'second', 'quite', 'much', 'then', 'good', 'ol', 'CNN', '7', 'seconds', 'different', 'angles', 'weird', 'way', 'less', 'shocking', 'became', 'so', 'familiar', 'seeing', 'film', 'more', 'personal', 'perspective.Some', 'will', 'likely', 'look', 'theatrical', 'film', 'United', '93', 'better', 'one', 'one', 'just', 'as', 'good']",Flight 93: The Movie
980799,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000EYJHDS,Craig Matteson,"[3, 3]","What is so particularly powerful about this movie is that it keeps us in the moment as if we were participants.  We are another passenger on the plane without any more knowledge of our fellow passengers than we would have on any other flight.  We get to know each other as the tragedy progresses.  Then we are a fly on the wall at the FAA, flight control, and NORAD.  We get the minute by minute unfolding of the events of that morning as they unfolded for the participants.  It is also worth noting that some of the military ""actors"" are the actual people, who were there and acted in those roles on 9/11,One of the most egregious of human activities is the use of 20/20 hindsight combined with a more than imperfect understanding of what actually happened during an event in order to assign blame.  Too often, a fiction is concocted about what happened in order to create an even worse fiction about what should have happened.  Reality unfolds as it doe.  Yes, people do make faulty decisions, but that is part of reality.  However, very often the decisions are neither right nor wrong at the time based upon the information actually available.  And when something is happening that is utterly different than what had gone before it takes time for people to adapt to dealing with the new reality.  This is part of what the enemy counts on.And on the morning of 9/11 it worked for them until the passengers on United 93 got information about the previous crashes.  Because the flight was delayed in its departure and because the terrorists took just a bit longer to attack the cockpit, the passengers were able to hear from their loved ones about the twin towers and even the Pentagon.  They were able to organize an attack.  The movie asserts that they were trying to re-take the plane, which makes complete sense.  And it asserts that they got into the cockpit.  This is much more satisfying than believing they did not.  From what I have read about the comments of those that have heard the tapes, the entry into the cockpit is not certain.  However, it is certain that the plane went down or was taken down in response to the attack by the passengers.  And every passenger on that plane who took part in the attempted re-capture or supported it deserves to be honored.Some might find the lack of backstory or the lack of explanation of what is happening moment by moment a bit disconcerting.  However, I found that it heightened the sense of reality for me.  Most of us have read enough or seen other specials on what happened on that plane that the broad story is well known.  It is nice to see a dramatic re-creation that sounds and looks more like reality than treating it as a kind of standard air-disaster story.Strongly recommended.",5,A telling of the story as if you were there without all the backstory or narration,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,2743,"['What', 'so', 'particularly', 'powerful', 'movie', 'moment', 'were', 'participants', 'are', 'passenger', 'plane', 'more', 'knowledge', 'fellow', 'passengers', 'would', 'have', 'other', 'flight', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'tragedy', 'Then', 'are', 'fly', 'wall', 'FAA', 'flight', 'control', 'NORAD', 'get', 'minute', 'minute', 'unfolding', 'events', 'morning', 'unfolded', 'participants', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'military', 'actors', 'are', 'actual', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'acted', 'roles', '9/11', 'One', 'most', 'egregious', 'human', 'activities', 'use', '20/20', 'hindsight', 'combined', 'more', 'imperfect', 'understanding', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'event', 'order', 'assign', 'blame', 'Too', 'often', 'fiction', 'concocted', 'what', 'happened', 'order', 'create', 'even', 'worse', 'fiction', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'happened', 'Reality', 'Yes', 'people', 'do', 'make', 'faulty', 'decisions', 'part', 'reality', 'However', 'very', 'often', 'decisions', 'are', 'neither', 'right', 'wrong', 'time', 'based', 'information', 'actually', 'available', 'when', 'something', 'happening', 'utterly', 'different', 'what', 'had', 'gone', 'time', 'people', 'adapt', 'dealing', 'new', 'reality', 'part', 'what', 'enemy', 'on.And', 'morning', '9/11', 'worked', 'passengers', 'United', '93', 'got', 'information', 'previous', 'crashes', 'flight', 'was', 'delayed', 'departure', 'terrorists', 'took', 'just', 'bit', 'longer', 'attack', 'cockpit', 'passengers', 'were', 'able', 'hear', 'loved', 'ones', 'twin', 'towers', 'even', 'Pentagon', 'were', 'able', 'organize', 'attack', 'movie', 'were', 'trying', 're-take', 'plane', 'complete', 'sense', 'got', 'cockpit', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'believing', 'did', 'not', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'comments', 'have', 'heard', 'tapes', 'entry', 'cockpit', 'not', 'certain', 'However', 'certain', 'plane', 'went', 'down', 'was', 'taken', 'down', 'response', 'attack', 'passengers', 'passenger', 'plane', 'who', 'took', 'part', 'attempted', 're-capture', 'supported', 'be', 'honored.Some', 'might', 'find', 'lack', 'backstory', 'lack', 'explanation', 'what', 'happening', 'moment', 'moment', 'bit', 'disconcerting', 'However', 'found', 'heightened', 'sense', 'reality', 'Most', 'have', 'read', 'enough', 'seen', 'other', 'specials', 'happened', 'plane', 'broad', 'story', 'well', 'known', 'nice', 'see', 'dramatic', 're-creation', 'more', 'reality', 'treating', 'kind', 'standard', 'air-disaster', 'story.Strongly', 'recommended']",Flight 93: The Movie

Baer,"[22, 22]","This fine A&E; reenactment of one slice of the confusing events of September 11, 2001 succeeds in showing the combination of ad hoc citizen response and highly professional management that greeted the high-speed unfolding of those incomprehensible events.The grippingly eerie music of the soundtrack frames the portraits of normalcy that open the film. Early on, we are shown the names of many of Flight 93's passengers when the camera focuses on the processing of their boarding passes by a Newark flight agent. From then on, we see them as real people who find themselves the protagonists of a seemingly unreal attack.When it becomes clear that Flight 93 is 'obviously not planning on landing', the passengers - with the encouragement or acquiescence of grieving family on the ground - do what they have to do to 'regain control of the plane'.Flight 93 suggests the possibility that orders were given - or would soon have been given - to take the flight down as it made its erratic way towards Washington. This reviewer - a frequent flyer - applauds discussion of this possibility and believes such action should be taken in the event we again find ourselves in this predicament.Flight 93 is not an easy film to watch. Yet it is salutary to do so, for a moment to imagine the terror experienced by civilians caught in a war in the airspace above a peaceful land, to see that evil *and* fear coexist in the eyes of the people who do such things, and to remember that sometimes the most dire of circumstances squeeze heroism to the surface of quite ordinary lives.",4,a completely different flight,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,1564,"['A', 'E', 'reenactment', 'one', 'slice', 'confusing', 'events', 'September', '11', '2001', 'showing', 'combination', 'ad', 'hoc', 'citizen', 'response', 'highly', 'professional', 'management', 'greeted', 'high-speed', 'unfolding', 'incomprehensible', 'events.The', 'grippingly', 'eerie', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'portraits', 'normalcy', 'film', 'Early', 'are', 'shown', 'names', 'many', 'Flight', '93', 'passengers', 'when', 'camera', 'processing', 'boarding', 'passes', 'Newark', 'flight', 'agent', 'then', 'see', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'protagonists', 'seemingly', 'unreal', 'clear', 'Flight', '93', ""'obviously"", 'not', 'planning', 'landing', 'passengers', 'encouragement', 'acquiescence', 'grieving', 'family', 'ground', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'do', ""'regain"", 'control', ""plane'.Flight"", '93', 'possibility', 'orders', 'were', 'given', 'would', 'soon', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'take', 'flight', 'down', 'made', 'erratic', 'way', 'Washington', 'frequent', 'flyer', 'applauds', 'discussion', 'possibility', 'such', 'action', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'event', 'again', 'find', 'predicament.Flight', '93', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'salutary', 'do', 'so', 'moment', 'imagine', 'terror', 'experienced', 'civilians', 'caught', 'war', 'airspace', 'peaceful', 'land', 'see', 'evil', '*and*', 'fear', 'coexist', 'eyes', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'such', 'things', 'remember', 'sometimes', 'most', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'squeeze', 'heroism', 'surface', 'quite', 'ordinary', 'lives']",Flight 93: The Movie
980803,A1OMFPO9MA1GYS,B000EYJHDS,Donald J. Keck,"[4, 6]","This is by far the best film on the foiled attempt to fly United Flight 93 into the Capitol or the White House on 9/11. In my opinion it is much better than the later Hollywood version entitled ""United 93."" Made for TV earlier this year, ""Flight 93"" was a powerful, gripping movie that fully engaged the viewers emotions. By focusing on the individual passangers and heroes of Flight 93 it made the viewer empathize with the actual people who acted with such courage and died in the attempt to foil the highjackers. The calls from the plane to loved ones on the ground were heart wrenching. I don't usually cry at movies, but I did while watching this one.By contrast ""United 93"" -- while an exciting, hold onto your seat reenactment of the event -- was, for the most part, a typical Hollywood chase movie. All of the people, so effectively portrayed in ""Flight 93,"" were anonymous in this version. The viewer learned nothing about them -- not even there names. (It seems to me that an anonymous hero is a contrdiction in terms.) Consequently the movie failed to engage one's emotions, except for a feeling of horror at the enormity of the terrorist's deeds. One felt little empathy for the actual real lfe passangers of Flight 93, because we did not get to know them as individuals.Instead the movie focused on the chaos of the situation both on the plane and on the ground, and on the chaotic attempts to get control of the situation by the air traffic controllers and, to a lesser extent, by the military.

The movie begins with scenes of passengers bidding fond farewells to their loved ones as they leave for the Newark Airport. Then the film shows each passenger's boarding ticket up close as they hand it over to the keeper of the flight gate.The film then shows how the hijackers went one at a time to the airplane restrooms to prepare for their attack on the flight attendants.They start by taking over first class, then they eventually move the passengers to the back of the plane. You get inside the huddle as passengers debate hpw they are going to take over the plane. You get to see the poignant phone calls that frightened passengers make to their tearful loved ones. Then you get to see the passengers carry out their heroic effort to reclaim control of the plane.The movie lacks the spectacular graphics and the presence of top shelf actors and actresses that one might expect of a higher budget film. But everyone does a wonderful job, and I was especially impressed with the actress who played the Verizon operator who spoke with Todd Beamer.

It keeps conjecture about what happened onboard to a minimum, in that most of the dialog is with people on the ground whom can verify what was actually said. That level of authenticity is appreciated.However, the film has two flaws, one minor, and one major. The first flaw the film's concentration on the emotions of the passengers and loved ones on the ground. I would have preferred more action and passenger plotting, even at the risk of more conjecture.The second flaw, and the one that removes the film from contention for five-star status, is that it does not take us with the passengers in their final moments of resolve, terror and courage as they try to wrest the plane from the control of the fanatics, only to have the plane driven into the ground. Instead, we only see the plane from a farmer's perspective, on the ground looking into the sky. This seems an uncharacteristic moment of cowardice on the part of the filmmakers, to have taken us so far on this flight with the passengers with whom we feel emotional connection, admiration and even love, but not let us fully participate in their horrible, tragic end.

980809,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000EYJHDS,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[17, 17]","On a bright September morning in 2001, four commercial airliners were hijacked by Arab terrorists.  Three of them were deliberately crashed into buildings; two into the World Trade Center and one into the Pentagon.  The fourth airliner, United Airlines flight 93, was also scheduled to be flown into a building, possibly the White House or the Capitol building, but the heroic passengers aboard this flight fought back against the terrorists. Despite knowing that they were all going to die, these brave people banded together and managed to thwart the efforts of the terrorists.The movie is shown through the eyes of the passengers of flight 93.  Their flight begins normally, but once airborne, four Arab terrorists, who claim to have a bomb, succeed in breaking into the cockpit and taking control of the aircraft.  The plane, originally bound for San Francisco, is turned around and is now heading east.  The terrorists, armed whitn box cutters, have already killed one of the passengers and wounded several others.  Some of the passengers, including Tom Burnett (Jeffrey Nordling) have begun making cell phone calls to their loved ones.  It is during one of these that Burnett learns from his wife that the World Trade Center has been struck.  Tom deduces that his plane is also intended to be used as a suicide plane to be flown into another building.Some of the other passengers, including Mark Bingham (Ty Olsson), Todd Beamer (Brennan Elliott), and Jeremy Glick (Colin Glazer) develop a plan to charge the cockpit and overthrow the terrorists.  In the meantime, Todd Beamer has called the Verizon center.  The call is answered by Lisa Jefferson (Monnae Michaell).  The conversation that transpires between the two strangers is both poignant and frightening, as Lisa is able to hear everything that is happening on the plane.  Todd finally asks Lisa to recite the Lord's Prayer with him.  Afterward, Todd utters the words that have become so famous to many; ""Let's Roll"".Despite their heroic efforts, flight 93 crashed in a rural area in Pennsylvania, just 20 minutes away from the nation's capitol.  The actions of these valiant passengers likely prevented the plane from reaching its intended target, widely thought to be the White House or the Capitol Building.This excellent movie is a fitting tribute to those heroic passengers aboard flight 93.  The acting is very good, and the story is retold with complete historical accuracy.  Ty Olsson, Brennan Elliott, Colin Glazer, Jeffrey Nordling, Laura Mennell (Elizabeth Wainio), and April Telek (Lyz Glick) all give powerful and moving performances as the passengers and loved ones of flight 93. Also included in the film are actual communications between the passengers and their loved ones on the ground.I highly recommend this heartbreaking and true story.  Despite the numerous casualties suffered during the attacks of September 11, 2001, the toll would have undoubtedly been much higher if not for the efforts of these brave and unselfish people.  This movie serves as a glowing tribute to those aboard the plane and their loved ones.

Perhaps the hijacker believed it did not matter, as he knew the intended resolution.Though a sad and emotional event, this DVD about it is good but not great.

It seemed that on one flight the passengers had put up a fight, and had caused the crash of their plane themselves, rather than waiting for the terrorists to use it as a weapon. This is the story of that flight, United Airlines Flight 93, the flight that fought back.Even though this was originally a made-for-TV movie, it is in fact one of the most moving movies that I have ever seen. The creators of the film did an excellent job of taking the bare facts of what happened, and fleshing it out into a believable and very moving film.

980818,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000EYJHDS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","The television movie ""Flight 93"" made it on to the air before""United 93""was released in theaters, but I never thought of there as being a competition between the two.  Large historical events lend themselves to more than one telling and with these too films and ""World Trade Center"" we are only beginning to see dramatizations of September 11th.  It is not surprising that the first couple of films would be about this particular flight, because it was the first instance of fighting back on what is now being called the War on Terrorism, but which may well end up being something even larger in history's eyes.Because the drama is happening aboard the plane and in the homes of those in touch with their loved ones by cell phone, ""Flight 93"" works on the intimacy of the small screen.  Peter Markle (""Faith of My Fathers"") and screenwriter Nevin Schreiner are limited by what little is publicly known about what happened on that flight.  Consequently, there is no attempt to fill in the gaps and smooth out the rough spots in the narrative.  When the passengers get together and talk about what should be done is the parts of the story that fascinates me the most, and there is relatively little of that in the film, but that is because there are only bits and pieces of it in the record of those events.  That is why there is so little about the four hijackers as well, because with few exceptions what they said in the cockpit is not known.The cast is comprised almost exclusively of unfamiliar faces to my eye, with Jeffrey Nordling (from ""Once and Again"") the only one I immediately recognized.  Not these are all new faces, but that they are mostly ones that we have seen in minor roles in dozens of different television shows.  Of course this helps reinforce the idea that these were ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  Actually, the ones that impressed me most in this telling of that day were the family members, who were urging those on the plane to take action, supporting their decision, and simply offering words of comfort.  This is the side of the story that is somewhat new, the rest having received considerably more coverage, and these scenes have power because we find ourselves imagining, perhaps for the first time, being in their position.Once the plane goes down this 2006 made for television movie loses its bearings a bit.  There is an inane comment by some suit investigating the crash and they suddenly turn up the music on the soundtrack.  Then there is the passage of the seasons, which I was expecting to end with the memorial to the passengers and crew of United 93, but that becomes the purpose of the final scroll before the end credits.  This underscores that of the four hijacked planes on 9/11, this was the one that did not hit its target, which is presumed to be either the White House or the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., and then we see the names of everybody on board.  However, these failings at the end are slight and do not detract from how riveting this film is, especially without the commercial interruptions.At the end of this film when they talk about the intended target of United 93 I found myself thinking that American Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon, was probably supposed to hit either the White House or the Capitol, with United 93 hitting the other.  Given all of the care the terrorist took in targeting the World Center, with the goal of bringing down the towers, hitting one side of the Pentagon is nowhere close to the same level.  So I am inclined to think that the terrorists on Flight 77 missed their target.  This might seem a small thing, but it would mean that when the people on Flight 93 made the terrorists crash the plane well short of Washington, D.C., they ended up missing half of their intended targets.",5,An intimate made for television version of United Flight 93 on September 11th,1156982400,"08 31, 2006",2006,3810,"['television', 'movie', 'Flight', '93', 'made', 'air', 'United', '93', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'never', 'thought', 'there', 'being', 'competition', 'two', 'Large', 'historical', 'events', 'lend', 'more', 'one', 'telling', 'too', 'films', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'are', 'only', 'beginning', 'see', 'dramatizations', 'September', '11th', 'not', 'surprising', 'first', 'couple', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'particular', 'flight', 'was', 'first', 'instance', 'fighting', 'back', 'what', 'now', 'being', 'called', 'War', 'Terrorism', 'may', 'well', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'something', 'even', 'larger', 'history', 'drama', 'happening', 'plane', 'homes', 'touch', 'loved', 'ones', 'cell', 'phone', 'Flight', '93', 'works', 'intimacy', 'small', 'screen', 'Peter', 'Markle', 'Faith', 'My', 'Fathers', 'screenwriter', 'Nevin', 'Schreiner', 'are', 'limited', 'what', 'little', 'publicly', 'known', 'what', 'happened', 'flight', 'Consequently', 'attempt', 'fill', 'gaps', 'smooth', 'out', 'rough', 'spots', 'narrative', 'When', 'passengers', 'get', 'together', 'talk', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'parts', 'story', 'most', 'relatively', 'little', 'film', 'are', 'only', 'bits', 'pieces', 'record', 'events', 'why', 'so', 'little', 'four', 'hijackers', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'exceptions', 'what', 'said', 'cockpit', 'not', 'known.The', 'cast', 'comprised', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'unfamiliar', 'eye', 'Jeffrey', 'Nordling', 'Once', 'Again', 'only', 'one', 'immediately', 'recognized', 'Not', 'are', 'new', 'are', 'mostly', 'ones', 'have', 'seen', 'minor', 'roles', 'dozens', 'different', 'television', 'shows', 'course', 'reinforce', 'idea', 'were', 'ordinary', 'people', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'Actually', 'ones', 'impressed', 'most', 'telling', 'day', 'were', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'were', 'urging', 'plane', 'take', 'action', 'supporting', 'decision', 'simply', 'offering', 'words', 'comfort', 'side', 'story', 'somewhat', 'new', 'rest', 'having', 'received', 'considerably', 'more', 'coverage', 'scenes', 'have', 'power', 'find', 'imagining', 'perhaps', 'first', 'time', 'being', 'position.Once', 'plane', 'down', '2006', 'made', 'television', 'movie', 'bearings', 'bit', 'inane', 'comment', 'suit', 'investigating', 'crash', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'up', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'Then', 'passage', 'seasons', 'was', 'expecting', 'end', 'memorial', 'passengers', 'crew', 'United', '93', 'purpose', 'final', 'scroll', 'end', 'four', 'hijacked', 'planes', '9/11', 'was', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'hit', 'target', 'presumed', 'be', 'White', 'House', 'Capitol', 'building', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'then', 'see', 'names', 'everybody', 'board', 'However', 'failings', 'end', 'are', 'slight', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'how', 'riveting', 'film', 'especially', 'commercial', 'interruptions.At', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'talk', 'intended', 'target', 'United', '93', 'found', 'thinking', 'American', 'Flight', '77', 'crashed', 'Pentagon', 'was', 'probably', 'supposed', 'hit', 'either', 'White', 'House', 'Capitol', 'United', '93', 'hitting', 'other', 'Given', 'care', 'terrorist', 'took', 'targeting', 'World', 'Center', 'goal', 'bringing', 'down', 'towers', 'hitting', 'one', 'side', 'Pentagon', 'nowhere', 'close', 'same', 'level', 'So', 'am', 'inclined', 'think', 'terrorists', 'Flight', '77', 'missed', 'target', 'might', 'seem', 'small', 'thing', 'would', 'mean', 'when', 'people', 'Flight', '93', 'made', 'terrorists', 'crash', 'plane', 'well', 'short', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'ended', 'up', 'missing', 'half', 'intended', 'targets']",Flight 93: The Movie

The passengers AREthe main characters and heroes of this film and the picture takes greatcare to allow the viewer to get to know them spending much time on themas they make their final calls to love ones or anyone on their phonesbefore they make the final effort to seize the plane before it strikesthe White House.

Most search engines on theinternet seem to be rigged to bring up UNITED 93 when one types FLIGHT93 The Left obviously want you to see the Greenglass film and not thisone so it behooves the freedom loving film fan to defy them.Probably the best film made on Sept 11 and highly recommended.",5,This is the good version.,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,3336,"['FLIGHT', '93', '2006', 'Directed', 'Peter', 'Markle.Starring', 'Jeffrey', 'Nording', 'Tom', 'Burnett', 'Brennan', 'Elliott', 'ToddBeamer.On', 'September', '11', '2001', 'Muslim', 'hyjacked', 'four', 'commercialpassenger', 'planes', 'intending', 'fly', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'thePentagon', 'White', 'House', 'Three', 'succeeded', 'story', 'ofthe', 'fourth', '.Flight', '93.The', 'artistic', 'community', 'general', 'Hollywood', 'specific', 'havewillfully', 'produced', 'flood', 'efluvia', '9/11', 'War', 'almost', 'itpoisonous', 'hate', 'filled', 'rubbish', 'most', 'reprehensible', 'nature', 'Thefilm', 'community', 'prostitution', 'Leftist', 'politics', 'Muslim', 'terrorand', 'seething', 'hate', 'have', 'produced', 'not', 'films', 'exhibits', 'afuture', 'trial', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'judged', 'history', 'are', 'not', 'films.They', 'are', 'not', 'art', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'forpleasure', 'are', 'merely', 'disgusting', 'ancestors', 'things', 'THEBIRTH', 'A', 'NATION', 'EARTH', 'MISSION', 'TO', 'MOSCOW', 'THE', 'ETERNAL', 'JEW', 'thatpeople', 'many', 'years', 'hence', 'will', 'stare', 'wonder', 'study', 'so', 'tounderstand', 'how', 'entire', 'community', 'so', 'called', 'artists', 'gleefully', 'choseto', 'debase', 'profession..That', 'said', 'Out', 'mountain', 'excement', 'somehow', 'managed', 'bud', 'afew', 'flowers', 'poor', 'sick', 'hesitant', 'daisies', 'three', 'genuine', 'orchidsof', 'great', 'worth', 'beauty', 'PATH', 'TO', '9/11', 'DC', '9/11', 'TIME', 'OF', 'CRISIS', 'andthis', 'film', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'predictably', 'Left', 'banned', 'firstwhile', 'Leftist', 'filmmakers', 'attempted', 'circumvent', 'film', 'theirown', 'version', 'story', 'awful', 'dull', 'UNITED', '93', 'PaulGreenglass.But', 'film', 'still', 'yet', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'Greenglass', 'film', 'vaguely', 'sympathetic', 'fourhyjackers', 'passengers', 'undifferentiated', 'somewhatfrightening', 'mob', 'THIS', 'film', 'focus', 'where', 'TRUEartist', 'not', 'mention', 'decent', 'person', 'would', 'tragedy', 'horrible', 'day', 'passengers', 'passengers', 'AREthe', 'main', 'characters', 'heroes', 'film', 'picture', 'greatcare', 'allow', 'viewer', 'get', 'know', 'spending', 'much', 'time', 'themas', 'make', 'final', 'calls', 'love', 'ones', 'anyone', 'phonesbefore', 'make', 'final', 'effort', 'seize', 'plane', 'strikesthe', 'White', 'House', 'Greenglass', 'film', 'revoltingly', 'even', 'cutTodd', 'Beamer', 'famous', 'line', 'LET', 'ROLL', 'who', 'just', 'considered', 'themdisposable', 'little', 'Eichmanns', 'interfereing', 'plans', 'heroic', 'freedomfighting', 'Muslim', 'terrorists', 'film', 'what', '.heroes', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'ramifications', 'day', 'had', 'ontheir', 'families', 'not', 'make', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'filmis', 'simply', 'devestating', 'yet', 'when', 'Biblical', 'epics', 'used', 'beshown', 'TV', 'Easter', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'Sept', '11', 'only', 'film', 'made', 'successfully', 'DAY.NOTE', 'been', 'subtle', 'attempt', 'Left', 'decieve', 'thepublic', 'seeing', 'Greenglass', 'film', 'UNITED', '93', 'want', 'toor', 'not', 'referring', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'reader', 'warned', 'bevery', 'careful', 'film', 'are', 'seeing', 'Most', 'search', 'engines', 'theinternet', 'seem', 'be', 'rigged', 'bring', 'up', 'UNITED', '93', 'when', 'one', 'FLIGHT93', 'Left', 'obviously', 'want', 'see', 'Greenglass', 'film', 'not', 'thisone', 'freedom', 'loving', 'film', 'fan', 'defy', 'them.Probably', 'best', 'film', 'made', 'Sept', '11', 'highly', 'recommended']",Flight 93: The Movie

Four planes were hijacked on the East Coast of the USA and with those hijackings thousands of lives were lost and millions more lives changed forever. In the weeks and months after 9/11 details began to emerge of the heroes of 9/11. Fourty-four of those heroes were on United Flight 93 and this film is their story.Apart from the news reports the only other sound in my living room on the evening of 9/11 was of me pulling another tissue from the box. That was a sound that was repeated while watching Flight 93. This is a story that had to be told but watching it was like being back on that fateful day, reliving the horror all over again.The passengers on board United Flight 93 watched in horror as their plane was hijacked. Several passengers phoned their loved ones to tell then what was happening only to hear that there were other hijackings happening along the East Coast and those planes were being slammed into buildings. Determined not to go down without a fight the passengers decided to try to take back control of the plane.It was harrowing to watch the passengers of United 93 talking to their loved ones and saying goodbye. Tears streamed down my face as my heart broke for the courage those people showed in a time of such horror.This was a wonderful dedication to the courage of the passengers aboard Flight 93 and one which should be watched by everyone to remind us of what real heroes look like.",5,Harrowing,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,1520,"['9/11', 'date', 'explaining', 'anyone', 'old', 'enough', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'day', 'Four', 'planes', 'were', 'hijacked', 'East', 'Coast', 'USA', 'hijackings', 'thousands', 'lives', 'were', 'lost', 'millions', 'more', 'lives', 'changed', 'forever', 'weeks', 'months', '9/11', 'details', 'began', 'emerge', 'heroes', '9/11', 'Fourty-four', 'heroes', 'were', 'United', 'Flight', '93', 'film', 'story.Apart', 'news', 'only', 'other', 'sound', 'living', 'room', 'evening', '9/11', 'was', 'pulling', 'tissue', 'box', 'was', 'sound', 'was', 'repeated', 'watching', 'Flight', '93', 'story', 'had', 'be', 'told', 'watching', 'was', 'being', 'back', 'fateful', 'day', 'reliving', 'horror', 'again.The', 'passengers', 'board', 'United', 'Flight', '93', 'watched', 'horror', 'plane', 'was', 'hijacked', 'Several', 'passengers', 'phoned', 'loved', 'ones', 'tell', 'then', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'only', 'hear', 'were', 'other', 'hijackings', 'happening', 'East', 'Coast', 'planes', 'were', 'being', 'slammed', 'buildings', 'Determined', 'not', 'go', 'down', 'fight', 'passengers', 'decided', 'try', 'take', 'back', 'control', 'plane.It', 'was', 'harrowing', 'watch', 'passengers', 'United', '93', 'talking', 'loved', 'ones', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'Tears', 'streamed', 'face', 'heart', 'broke', 'courage', 'people', 'showed', 'time', 'such', 'horror.This', 'was', 'wonderful', 'dedication', 'courage', 'passengers', 'Flight', '93', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'everyone', 'remind', 'what', 'real', 'heroes', 'look']",Flight 93: The Movie
