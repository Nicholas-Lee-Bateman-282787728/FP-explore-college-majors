This movie will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat until the very last scene. This is a different type of horror movie as it is about a group of people making a documentary/reality tv show and things go really wrong in the process. This is a movie within a movie so thats pretty different than most movies today. There is some gore in the movie but it's not overly done which I like. There are also some funny parts in the movie so you get horror and comedy in the same movie.

The production level was okay, not bad editing, lighting was fine, it really was just a weak plot and I never jumped in my seat once.

1217146,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001MFNB8U,trebe,"[5, 8]","Some stylistic editing, helps distinguish Killer Movie (2008) from most other slasher flicks.  Director/writer Jeff Fisher's film is pretty slick looking affair, that features a number of inserted interview type clips to give the film  a reality TV look, and also helps advance the story.  The presence of sitcom veteran Kaley Cuoco (The Big Bang Theory, 8 Simple Rules), adds some spice, and gives the film some balls, as her character, a foul mouthed diva type, is a switch from the 'good girl' roles she is more well known for.A television crew arrives in White Plains, North Dakota, to shoot a piece about The Goldiggers, the local high school hockey team.  It seems pretty routine, but what producer Lee Tyson (Cyia Batten) instructs director Jake Tanner (Paul Wesley) to try to do, is also dig up some dirt about the death of a local teenage girl, who was mysteriously beheaded while riding on a scooter.  Awaiting the arrival of starlet Blanca Champion (Cuoco), the crew starts shooting interviews at the school.  A masked killer also begins to get very busy, arranging an accident for the cheerleading coach, offing the hockey coach, and then taking a pick to a production assistant.  A few murders don't seem to stir things up very much, and even as the bodies continue to pile up, the townsfolk and even law enforcement, remain completely unconcerned.  The killer is an enormous Blanca Champion fan, and is bent on proving it to her.  Although increasingly shorthanded, the crew pushes on, until there is a final confrontation at the school.There are some nice gory bits, including a near decapitated head flopping, a body strung up on the wall of the gym, and a hanging via chain scene.  Almost everyone in the crew falls victim to the very active killer.  Much that happens, does not make a lot of sense, as the killer seems to be everywhere, pushing up the body count.Kaley Cuoco seems to be having a blast playing a vamp, and swearing up a storm.  She is the best thing about this movie, and makes a seamless transition from being frightened, to a clear thinking and rational.  Paul Wesley (The Vampire Diaries) tries to take his role seriously, but it isn't easy, as his character Jake is pretty passive most of  the film, until the end, when he makes an impossible recovery from a serious injury, that should have left him incapable of walking.  Adriana DeMeo (Without a Trace), is funny and quirky, as a member of the crew, and Maitland McConnell (Ninja Cheerleaders) is amusing as an overemotional cheerleader.  The acting is a mixed bag, and no one will be willing any awards, but at least the cast features some attractive actors, and snappy aggressive dialog.Attempting to live up to its name, Killer Movie does feature a lot of kills, and the level of violence ramps up with each successive kill, peaking in the final twenty minutes.  Not all the kills are graphic or that impressive though.  Suspense and tension could be built up if there were more pursuit, or interaction between the killer and his victims, instead of quick strike kills.  The killer may be a surprise, although the reason for the murderous spree is rather tenuous.Killer Movie does not offer much that is really original, but if you have a fondness for slashers, and like a lot of victims, you may want to take a look.  The film is definitely recommended to Kaley Cuoco fans, as she is having fun with her role.  She does not appear until after the 31 minute mark, but that is when things really get started.  The feature is subtitled in Spanish only, contains the trailer, a photo gallery, a short behind the scenes featurette, and a digital copy of the movie in Windows and Mac formats.",3,the champion of the Blanca Champion fan club . . .,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,3681,"['stylistic', 'editing', 'distinguish', 'Killer', 'Movie', '2008', 'most', 'other', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'Director/writer', 'Jeff', 'Fisher', 'film', 'pretty', 'slick', 'looking', 'affair', 'number', 'inserted', 'interview', 'type', 'clips', 'give', 'film', 'reality', 'TV', 'look', 'also', 'advance', 'story', 'presence', 'sitcom', 'veteran', 'Kaley', 'Cuoco', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', '8', 'Simple', 'Rules', 'spice', 'film', 'balls', 'character', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'diva', 'type', 'switch', ""'good"", 'girl', 'roles', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'for.A', 'television', 'crew', 'White', 'Plains', 'North', 'Dakota', 'shoot', 'piece', 'Goldiggers', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'hockey', 'team', 'pretty', 'routine', 'what', 'producer', 'Lee', 'Tyson', 'Cyia', 'Batten', 'director', 'Jake', 'Tanner', 'Paul', 'Wesley', 'try', 'do', 'also', 'dig', 'up', 'dirt', 'death', 'local', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'mysteriously', 'beheaded', 'riding', 'scooter', 'Awaiting', 'arrival', 'starlet', 'Blanca', 'Champion', 'Cuoco', 'crew', 'shooting', 'interviews', 'school', 'masked', 'killer', 'also', 'get', 'very', 'busy', 'arranging', 'accident', 'cheerleading', 'coach', 'offing', 'hockey', 'coach', 'then', 'taking', 'pick', 'production', 'assistant', 'few', 'murders', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stir', 'things', 'up', 'very', 'much', 'even', 'bodies', 'continue', 'pile', 'up', 'townsfolk', 'even', 'law', 'enforcement', 'remain', 'completely', 'unconcerned', 'killer', 'enormous', 'Blanca', 'Champion', 'fan', 'bent', 'proving', 'increasingly', 'shorthanded', 'crew', 'final', 'confrontation', 'school.There', 'are', 'nice', 'gory', 'bits', 'including', 'near', 'decapitated', 'head', 'flopping', 'body', 'up', 'wall', 'gym', 'hanging', 'chain', 'scene', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'crew', 'victim', 'very', 'active', 'killer', 'Much', 'not', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'killer', 'be', 'everywhere', 'pushing', 'up', 'body', 'count.Kaley', 'Cuoco', 'be', 'having', 'blast', 'playing', 'vamp', 'swearing', 'up', 'storm', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'seamless', 'transition', 'being', 'frightened', 'clear', 'thinking', 'rational', 'Paul', 'Wesley', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'take', 'role', 'seriously', ""n't"", 'easy', 'character', 'Jake', 'pretty', 'passive', 'most', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'impossible', 'recovery', 'serious', 'injury', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'incapable', 'walking', 'Adriana', 'DeMeo', 'Trace', 'funny', 'quirky', 'member', 'crew', 'Maitland', 'McConnell', 'Ninja', 'Cheerleaders', 'amusing', 'overemotional', 'cheerleader', 'acting', 'mixed', 'bag', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'willing', 'awards', 'least', 'cast', 'attractive', 'actors', 'snappy', 'aggressive', 'dialog.Attempting', 'live', 'up', 'name', 'Killer', 'Movie', 'feature', 'lot', 'kills', 'level', 'violence', 'ramps', 'up', 'successive', 'kill', 'peaking', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Not', 'kills', 'are', 'graphic', 'impressive', 'Suspense', 'tension', 'could', 'be', 'built', 'up', 'were', 'more', 'pursuit', 'interaction', 'killer', 'victims', 'instead', 'quick', 'strike', 'kills', 'killer', 'may', 'be', 'surprise', 'reason', 'murderous', 'spree', 'rather', 'tenuous.Killer', 'Movie', 'not', 'offer', 'much', 'really', 'original', 'have', 'fondness', 'slashers', 'lot', 'victims', 'may', 'want', 'take', 'look', 'film', 'definitely', 'recommended', 'Kaley', 'Cuoco', 'fans', 'having', 'fun', 'role', 'not', 'appear', '31', 'minute', 'mark', 'when', 'things', 'really', 'get', 'started', 'feature', 'subtitled', 'Spanish', 'only', 'trailer', 'photo', 'gallery', 'short', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'digital', 'copy', 'movie', 'Windows', 'Mac', 'formats']",N/A
