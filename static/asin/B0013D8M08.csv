He is from the country of Hungry, which is a joke because he's a Hungry cook...ha ha. The first kill was pretty good and led to so much potential. The girls were fun to watch and should be cast in anther film. I usually don't care about actors and actresses in horror movies but these girls worked well together. The cook couldn't speak english and only could utter ok, which got annoying. The Cook eventually kills everyone in the house and moves on to anther college house.Overall, a fast paced movie with some good kills and gore. The cook got annoying after awhile and the ending was plain dull. I cannot imagine anther film with this guy. I recommend it because it's worth a look.",3,The Cook,1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,746,"['cook', 'college', 'house', ""n't"", 'speak', 'english', 'country', 'Hungry', 'joke', 'Hungry', 'cook', 'ha', 'ha', 'first', 'kill', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'led', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'girls', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'should', 'be', 'cast', 'anther', 'film', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'actors', 'actresses', 'horror', 'movies', 'girls', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'cook', 'could', ""n't"", 'speak', 'english', 'only', 'could', 'utter', 'ok', 'got', 'annoying', 'Cook', 'eventually', 'everyone', 'house', 'moves', 'anther', 'college', 'house.Overall', 'fast', 'paced', 'movie', 'good', 'kills', 'gore', 'cook', 'got', 'annoying', 'awhile', 'ending', 'was', 'plain', 'dull', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anther', 'film', 'guy', 'recommend', 'look']","Cook, The"
1141343,A3SBCBEN4NGK5I,B0013D8M08,B-Movie Fan,"[8, 11]","""The Cook"" is another in the recent crop of horror-comedies that, like so many of its brethren, fails to live up to its hype.  Even graded on the b-movie curve this story only rates a 2.5 (rounded up to 3 for ridiculous amounts of prurient behavior and some decent fan-boy humor.)The story takes place in a sorority house (and thus begins our exploitation potential), where the girls who didn't go ""away"" on spring break are planning on carousing their way through the long weekend.  Please note, I'm not entirely sure if the decision to ""carouse"" without any (well nearly any) participation by the opposite sex was done for budgetary or ""exploitive reasons, but the fact that the Sorority is ""Lambda Epsilon Zeta"" tends to make me think the latter.As an added twist, our killer is the Sorority's new cook.  Who has just arrived from Hungary and speaks ""very"" little English.  His motif is not hockey masks or a clawed glove, no this serial killer goes for cannibalism in a ""culinary"" sort of way and then feeding the ""remains"" of his kills to his future victims.I really wanted to like this movie.  I mean hey, it's full of pretty young things.  It doesn't take itself too seriously.  It has a geeky love story and a ""fall from innocence"" (sort of) subplot going on and the ads promise nudity and gore.  What more could a low brow horror movie fan ask for?Well, for starters he could ask for the actual delivery of some more of the nudity, but that's actually a fairly minor point.  By the very act of watching a movie like this, the viewer agrees to suspend disbelief, up to a point.  I can tolerate (enjoy?) a cannibalistic serial killer who just happens to wind-up in a Sorority House full of improbably beautiful and hedonistic coeds.  But I'd like a little internal consistency to my story.  I have some real problems with a Sorority House where the acoustics allow for the inhabitants to hear raised voices one minute, but not the tortured screams of the killer's victims the next minute (especially when the murder is supposed to be happening right down the hall.)  Ditto, after about the second meal where the ""perpetually dieting"" thin coeds don't complain, or even comment on the fact, that the cook is serving them all ""heavy"" meat based meals all the time, my suspension of disbelief begins to wear.  But, where the movie really suffers (as so many of them do) is when the writer tries to fill in the time leading up to the killings with dialogue; and does so in an incredibly painfully incompetent manner.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not asking for Quentin Tarantino level dialogue.  I'm asking for ""don't make me cringe"" level dialogue.All in all, the production values were good, the concept was entertaining (campy), the kills delivered large quantities of gore, and the actresses were easy on the eyes.  If all you want is some fan-boy humor, rated PG-13/R eye candy, and your eighties style slasher movie fix, this might be the movie for you.",3,So much exploitation promised; so little delivered.,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,2958,"['Cook', 'recent', 'crop', 'horror-comedies', 'so', 'many', 'brethren', 'fails', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'Even', 'graded', 'b-movie', 'curve', 'story', 'only', 'rates', '2.5', 'rounded', 'up', '3', 'ridiculous', 'amounts', 'prurient', 'behavior', 'decent', 'fan-boy', 'humor', 'story', 'place', 'sorority', 'house', 'thus', 'exploitation', 'potential', 'where', 'girls', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'spring', 'break', 'are', 'planning', 'carousing', 'way', 'long', 'weekend', 'Please', 'note', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'decision', 'carouse', 'well', 'nearly', 'participation', 'opposite', 'sex', 'was', 'done', 'budgetary', 'exploitive', 'reasons', 'fact', 'Sorority', 'Lambda', 'Epsilon', 'Zeta', 'make', 'think', 'latter.As', 'added', 'twist', 'killer', 'Sorority', 'new', 'cook', 'Who', 'just', 'arrived', 'Hungary', 'very', 'little', 'English', 'motif', 'not', 'hockey', 'masks', 'clawed', 'glove', 'serial', 'killer', 'cannibalism', 'culinary', 'sort', 'way', 'then', 'feeding', 'remains', 'kills', 'future', 'victims.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'mean', 'hey', 'full', 'pretty', 'young', 'things', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'geeky', 'love', 'story', 'fall', 'innocence', 'sort', 'subplot', 'going', 'ads', 'promise', 'nudity', 'gore', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'low', 'brow', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'ask', 'Well', 'starters', 'could', 'ask', 'actual', 'delivery', 'more', 'nudity', 'actually', 'fairly', 'minor', 'point', 'very', 'act', 'watching', 'movie', 'viewer', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'up', 'point', 'can', 'tolerate', 'enjoy', 'cannibalistic', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'just', 'wind-up', 'Sorority', 'House', 'full', 'improbably', 'beautiful', 'hedonistic', 'coeds', ""'d"", 'like', 'little', 'internal', 'consistency', 'story', 'have', 'real', 'problems', 'Sorority', 'House', 'where', 'acoustics', 'allow', 'inhabitants', 'hear', 'raised', 'voices', 'one', 'minute', 'not', 'tortured', 'screams', 'killer', 'victims', 'next', 'minute', 'especially', 'when', 'murder', 'supposed', 'be', 'happening', 'right', 'hall', 'Ditto', 'second', 'meal', 'where', 'perpetually', 'dieting', 'thin', 'coeds', 'do', ""n't"", 'complain', 'even', 'comment', 'fact', 'cook', 'serving', 'heavy', 'meat', 'based', 'meals', 'time', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'begins', 'wear', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'suffers', 'so', 'many', 'do', 'when', 'writer', 'fill', 'time', 'leading', 'up', 'killings', 'dialogue', 'so', 'incredibly', 'painfully', 'incompetent', 'manner', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'asking', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'level', 'dialogue', ""'m"", 'asking', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'cringe', 'level', 'dialogue.All', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'good', 'concept', 'was', 'entertaining', 'campy', 'kills', 'delivered', 'large', 'quantities', 'gore', 'actresses', 'were', 'easy', 'eyes', 'want', 'fan-boy', 'humor', 'rated', 'PG-13/R', 'eye', 'candy', 'eighties', 'style', 'slasher', 'movie', 'fix', 'might', 'be', 'movie']","Cook, The"

The first half focuses on the girls' interaction, as scandulous as it is.  That interaction is loaded with hilarious dialogue and surprising confessions that teter towards soft porn, so expect some T & A.  The last half are the death scenes, which in my opinion, are better than expected and add a touch of originality.
