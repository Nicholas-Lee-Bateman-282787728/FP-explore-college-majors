1161743,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00197POYK,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","This is the unvarnished story of Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas. Phelps and his family are interviewed, officials of Topeka, people who have been picketed by them, a lawyer who has taken them to court, European tourists who said they had heard of American crazies, but couldn't believe what they saw. There are also interviews with the Phelps children, and it's heartbreaking to hear them talk so hatefully when they clearly do not understand what they are saying.There are many, many views of the pickets and their brightly colored signs. You get so you don't really read them or see them anymore; the colors identify them as ""those nuts"" and you turn your head, or maybe you confront them. And if you do, you hear the most twisted rhetoric, the most distorted interpretations of Bible passages, the most coarse and hateful language you are ever likely to hear in pubic.One event I really appreciated was the funeral of a young soldier who had been a motorcycle rider before he went into the Army and was sent to Iraq. The local bikers came to the funeral and set up a line in front of the Westboro pickets, and when they started shouting their filth, the bikers turned their tailpipes toward them and revved their engines. Most of the bikes were Harleys, and it was quite an effective drowning out of the shouting.The real irony of the whole situation was summed up by a Topeka minister of the more Christian type of church, who said that Phelps is a classic example of a person who needs love most, and is least worthy of it. The movie then closes with a quiet, almost whispered singing of ""They Will Know We Are Christians by Our Love.""And we will know Westboro by its hate.",3,Westboro Baptist Church Under a Microscope,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1709,"['unvarnished', 'story', 'Fred', 'Phelps', 'Westboro', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'Topeka', 'Kansas', 'Phelps', 'family', 'are', 'interviewed', 'officials', 'Topeka', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'picketed', 'lawyer', 'who', 'taken', 'court', 'European', 'tourists', 'who', 'said', 'had', 'heard', 'American', 'crazies', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'saw', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'Phelps', 'children', 'heartbreaking', 'hear', 'talk', 'so', 'hatefully', 'when', 'clearly', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'saying.There', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'views', 'pickets', 'brightly', 'colored', 'signs', 'get', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'read', 'see', 'anymore', 'colors', 'identify', 'nuts', 'turn', 'head', 'maybe', 'confront', 'do', 'hear', 'most', 'twisted', 'rhetoric', 'most', 'distorted', 'interpretations', 'Bible', 'passages', 'most', 'coarse', 'hateful', 'language', 'are', 'ever', 'likely', 'hear', 'pubic.One', 'event', 'really', 'appreciated', 'was', 'funeral', 'young', 'soldier', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'motorcycle', 'rider', 'went', 'Army', 'was', 'sent', 'Iraq', 'local', 'bikers', 'came', 'funeral', 'set', 'up', 'line', 'front', 'Westboro', 'pickets', 'when', 'started', 'shouting', 'filth', 'bikers', 'turned', 'tailpipes', 'revved', 'engines', 'Most', 'bikes', 'were', 'Harleys', 'was', 'quite', 'effective', 'drowning', 'shouting.The', 'real', 'irony', 'whole', 'situation', 'was', 'summed', 'up', 'Topeka', 'minister', 'more', 'Christian', 'type', 'church', 'who', 'said', 'Phelps', 'classic', 'example', 'person', 'who', 'love', 'most', 'least', 'worthy', 'movie', 'then', 'quiet', 'almost', 'whispered', 'singing', 'Will', 'Know', 'Are', 'Christians', 'Love', 'will', 'know', 'Westboro', 'hate']",Fall from Grace
1161744,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00197POYK,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[8, 8]","Born in 1929, Fred Phelps attended Bob Jones University, the Prairie Bible Institute, and John Muir College and subsequently earned a law degree from Washburn University in 1962 and opened his own law firm in Topeka, Kansas in 1964.  Three years later Phelps incorporated Westboro Baptist Church in the same city and established himself as its pastor.  As the 1960s progressed he became well known as a civil rights attorney, frequently bringing suit on behalf of minorities; indeed, he became so well known in this field that he ultimately received an award for his work from the NAACP.  But something was going astray, and it became increasingly obvious as the 1960s drifted into the 1970s.In 1977 Phelps filed a seemingly spurious lawsuit against court reporter Carolene Brady, and by most accounts his treatment of Brady while she was on the witness stand was utterly appalling.  When Phelps lost the case he appealed, but on this occasion he completely over-reached himself: he prepared a number of affidavits that Brady was able to demonstrate were fraudlent, and in 1979 Phelps was disbarred from the practice of Kansas law.  He continued to practice before the federal court, however, until no fewer than nine federal judges began to find him as disasteful as the Kansas bar association had and in 1985 filed formal complaint against him.  The complaint was settled in 1989 when Phelps agreed to cease practice of the law before the federal court as well.Now focused entirely upon his church, which consisted almost exclusively of his own large family, Phelps found a new venue: homosexuality.  Various accounts have been given of how Phelps and Westboro Baptist Church came to focus on this subject, but most seem to stem from a Phelps family member's allegation of homosexual activity in a public park near the church.  Whatever the case, Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church began to picket and protest against homosexuals, and in 1998 they attained the national spotlight when they picketed and protested in Laramie, Wyoming following the murder of Matthew Shepard.  Since that time they have never looked back.  It is difficult to know how factual the statement is, but in 2009 they claimed to have staged 41,000 protests in 650 cities since 1991.Although Phelps and Westboro typically focus on homosexuality, they also picket and protest anything and any one they can even remotely construe as connected with homosexuality.  Condemned people range from Diana, Princess of Wales to Rev. Billy Graham; condemned religious institutions include The Roman Catholic Church, The Church of Latter Day Saints, and indeed virtually every Christian and non-Christian denomination; and entire nations, including the United States, Canada, The United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, and a host of others.  A number of respected organizations have defined Westboro Baptist Church as a hate group, and both Phelps and the church are monitored by such groups as Southern Poverty Law Center, which track hate groups and hate crimes.Released in 2007, FALL FROM GRACE includes one of the last interviews granted by Fred Phelps himself, who is now more commonly represented by son Timothy Phelps and daughter Shirley Phelps Roper.  The weakness in the documentary, which at 71 minutes has little time for such, is that it offers little background; although it does touch on Phelp's legal career and disbarment, and even more so on the accusations of child abuse leveled against him, there is little in the way of Phelp's personal history.  Even so, what has made it to the screen is utterly astonishing, and while the documentary contains interesting and frequently moving interviews with those who oppose Phelps, the most astonishing moments come from Phelps and his own family.  Although son Timothy seems to have a truly nasty disposition, both Phelps and daughter Shirley seem quite calm, perhaps even likeable--at least until you seriously listen to their comments and see them in actual action, at which point they suddenly seem more akin to demons from the pit than human beings, much less Christians.  Perhaps most shocking of all are interviews with the family's children, who respond with venom on a subject they are very clearly too young to know anything about.It is particularly to director K. Ryan Jones' credit (and astonishingly, he began work on this documentary while still a college student) that he does not slant his own point of view into the proceedings.  He simply allows Phelps and his minions to behave as they normally do without making editorial comment, and the result is more powerful than a number of other documentaries that have included Phelps and family.  Words like ""evil"" may seem old fashioned, but they apply here, and FALL FROM GRACE allows it to show itself with maximum visibility.  A great many commentators have found reason to laugh at Phelps and to make fun of his followers, but this film puts across a truth that is far more uncomfortable: there is nothing funny about poison.  Nothing funny at all.  The DVD includes two bonuses, one an interview with director Jones, one a brief display of the way Phelps and Westboro Baptist Church received the film when it was released.Powerful and recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,A Dispassionate Portrait of Vicious Insanity,1253232000,"09 18, 2009",2009,5257,"['Born', '1929', 'Fred', 'Phelps', 'attended', 'Bob', 'Jones', 'University',

The church was also depicted by Louis Theroux in ""The Most Hated Family in America"". Theroux succeeded in getting close to the family in a way that ""Fall from Grace"" doesn't. What ""Fall from Grace"" does that Theroux failed to do is interview some of the Phelps children who's left the church. This offers a new perspective on the church although the interviews were brief and done over the phone. ""Fall from Grace"" also includes interviews with some people of the Topeka community, including the mayor, police chief and a lawyer.

Phelps was once a successful Civil Rights attorney who won an award from the NAACP for representing minority clients. Since being disbarred for unethical behavior, Phelps has concentrated his energies on running the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas.Never mind that the only members of the church are Phelps' own family, the Phelps clan is large enough and vocal enough to make up for its lack of outside members. The Phelpses have protested at the funerals of U.S. soldiers who have been killed in action; they have also baited everyone who offends them by trampling the American Flag and by displaying signs with slogans such as ""God Hates Fags"" emblazoned on them.Fall from Grace easily holds the viewer's interest throughout its 70+ minutes. While the Phelps clan is certainly vile, they know a thing or two about getting attention. (They've participated in over 20,000 protests). Some of their protests are akin to performance art. The interviews with the Phelps family are amazing; there is a younger generation of Phelpses who are prepared to take over from Fred. The interviews with Phelps' estranged children help give the viewer some idea of what the man is like in private.There are a few missed opportunities in Fall from Grace. I don't think that the filmmaker did enough to explore Phelps' past. I was surprised to learn that he had been an attorney and that he had done some admirable work. Some of Phelps' children are also attorneys. Also, the film is a ""just the facts"" presentation. The viewer wants to know why Phelps chooses to promote this bizarre, bitter philosophy, but answers (or even conjectures) are missing.I strongly recommend Fall from Grace.
