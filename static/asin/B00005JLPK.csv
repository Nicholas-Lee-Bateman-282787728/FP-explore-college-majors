602907,A1X3HW20S9TK9P,B00005JLPK,Aaron Edson,"[2, 2]","Julie Taymor truly fascinates me. I was blown away by her knockout film debut Titus, and now she has created this excellent follow up, Frida. I loved Frida's artwork and was very excited to see this film, and was there in the theater opening weekend. I have to say I was not let down at all. Most of the audience enjoyed the movie too from what I overheard after the film ended.I loved the lush colors, as many other reviews has stated. But, a lot of the color schemes were beautiful as well. For example, the scene where Frida is in Paris with the singing woman (which she spent the night with) was excellent. I loved the washed golden pallet used for that part.Also, the bus collision toward the films opening was perfectly done. I loved all the little details such as the blue bird, oranges, and gold. The shot of Frida covered in blood as the goled dust covered her was truly haunting. Other things were nice as well like the New York collage, and the way Frida's paintings blended into her real life showed the emotional aspect from where the artwork came from. One part that is truly heartbreaking was the painting with her in the back brace, when the stone pillar that represented her spine crackles into many disjointed sections, and water wells up in the paintings eyes like tears. Artwork like that packs a powerful punch.True, it may seem that the movie is more of a ""highlights"" or ""greatest hits"" of Frida's life rather then a textured novel. The movie dances from one event to the other. But, then again, it probably felt that way to Frida herself.On another note, Salma Hayek was excellent in this role. I remember during Oscar season when everyone said she was the first one out of the race for Best Actress. After watching this again, I storngly disagree. You can honestly see Frida morph from a young wild girl, into the artist and woman, and finally into a angry cripple that still retained her humor. Hayek did this role justice. I shudder to think that Madonna and Jennifer Lopez wanted to play the famed painter in competing projects.Finally to round out this review I would like to compliment this wonderful 2 Disc Dvd set. Julie Taymor has embraced the format to full extent with Titus, and now with Frida. Nothing but top quality from her.

Hayek is perfect as the petite Frida, and Alfred Molina so believable as Rivera. There are small parts filled in by Edward Norton, Ashley Judd, and Antonio Banderas, and with Geoffrey Rush as Trotsky.I especially like the acclaimed Welsh actor, Roger Rees, as Guillermo, Frida's father, and beautiful Valeria Golino, as Rivera's ex-wife.The soundtrack by Elliot Goldenthal (Taymor's husband) is terrific, full of traditional Mexican songs that add so much to this film.The magnificent Lila Downs sings several songs (she is briefly seen in 3 of them), and among them is a signature song for her, ""La Llorona""...a second version of this song is sung by the legendary Costa Rican star of years gone by, Chavela Vargas, and another treat is the voice of Caetano Veloso in the final end title song.Perhaps my favorite part of this film are the ""living paintings"".

602910,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JLPK,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","I recently read an article in the New York Review of Books (May 15, 2008) analyzing the work of the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo that reminded me how much I liked this film, especially the performance by Ms. Hayek (who received an Oscar nomination for her efforts and who bore a striking resemblance to Frida in the film). The gist of the article, which included some biographical detail that is also explored here (her various severe mental and physical problems, his stormy relationship with her fellow artist and husband the world famous muralist Diego Rivera, her bisexuality), is that while much of Kahlo's artistic work reflected her strong psychic attachment to Mexico it also placed her squarely in the camp of naturalist painters.I am not enough of an art devotee to make comment on that above mentioned critique, however, from the several paintings of Kahlo's that I have seen I would argue a little more toward the surrealist school that virtually every Mexican artist in the 1920's and 1930's drew from as they created their work. But enough of that argument for now. This film, in its own round about way, by presenting the various psychic pains (failure to have the children she desperately wanted, her topsy- turvy relationship with Rivera as she tries to make her own space in the art world and the underlying tensions of combining politics and artistic endeavor) gives a fairly decent gloss, for a commercial film, on the trials and tribulations of being a Mexican woman artist in the early part of the 20th century.Of course, for this political junkie and admirer of Leon Trotsky the names Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera conjure up political connections as much as art. One of the strands working its way through the film is this couple's relationship with the exiled Trotsky when President Cardenas granted him a visa in 1937. All sources that I have read and photographs that I have seen have mentioned that Trotsky was smitten with Frida's exotic beauty (to the furor of his companion, Natalia). However, it was rather startling to watch the episode where Trotsky jumps into bed with Ms. Kahlo. I have noted elsewhere that the old time revolutionaries, especially the Russians, were extremely reticent about discussing personal sexual matters in their memoirs and autobiographies. Trotsky was no exception. Is that scene merely cinematic license or was Trotsky really just a dirty old man? You decide. I will concentrate of his political wisdom. And Frida's strangely exotic paintings.",4,An Exotic Flower,1210723200,"05 14, 2008",2008,2502,"['recently', 'read', 'article', 'New', 'York', 'Review', 'Books', 'May', '15', '2008', 'analyzing', 'work', 'Mexican', 'artist', 'Frida', 'Kahlo', 'reminded', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'film', 'especially', 'performance', 'Ms.', 'Hayek', 'who', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'efforts', 'who', 'bore', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Frida', 'film', 'gist', 'article', 'included', 'biographical', 'detail', 'also', 'explored', 'here', 'various', 'severe', 'mental', 'physical', 'problems', 'stormy', 'relationship', 'fellow', 'artist', 'husband', 'world', 'famous', 'muralist', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'bisexuality', 'much', 'Kahlo', 'artistic', 'work', 'reflected', 'strong', 'psychic', 'attachment', 'Mexico', 'also', 'placed', 'squarely', 'camp', 'naturalist', 'painters.I', 'am', 'not', 'enough', 'art', 'devotee', 'make', 'comment', 'above', 'mentioned', 'critique', 'however', 'several', 'paintings', 'Kahlo', 'have', 'seen', 'would', 'argue', 'little', 'more', 'surrealist', 'school', 'virtually', 'Mexican', 'artist', '1920', '1930', 'drew', 'created', 'work', 'enough', 'argument', 'now', 'film', 'own', 'round', 'way', 'presenting', 'various', 'psychic', 'pains', 'failure', 'have', 'children', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'topsy-', 'turvy', 'relationship', 'Rivera', 'make', 'own', 'space', 'art', 'world', 'underlying', 'tensions', 'combining', 'politics', 'artistic', 'endeavor', 'fairly', 'decent', 'gloss', 'commercial', 'film', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'being', 'Mexican', 'woman', 'artist', 'early', 'part', '20th', 'century.Of', 'course', 'political', 'junkie', 'admirer', 'Leon', 'Trotsky', 'names', 'Frida', 'Kahlo', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'conjure', 'up', 'political', 'connections', 'as', 'much', 'art', 'One', 'strands', 'working', 'way', 'film', 'couple', 'relationship', 'exiled', 'Trotsky', 'when', 'President', 'Cardenas', 'granted', 'visa', '1937', 'sources', 'have', 'read', 'photographs', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Trotsky', 'was', 'smitten', 'Frida', 'exotic', 'beauty', 'furor', 'companion', 'Natalia', 'However', 'was', 'rather', 'startling', 'watch', 'episode', 'where', 'Trotsky', 'bed', 'Ms.', 'Kahlo', 'have', 'noted', 'elsewhere', 'old', 'time', 'revolutionaries', 'especially', 'Russians', 'were', 'extremely', 'reticent', 'discussing', 'personal', 'sexual', 'matters', 'memoirs', 'autobiographies', 'Trotsky', 'was', 'exception', 'scene', 'merely', 'cinematic', 'license', 'was', 'Trotsky', 'really', 'just', 'dirty', 'old', 'man', 'decide', 'will', 'concentrate', 'political', 'wisdom', 'Frida', 'strangely', 'exotic', 'paintings']",Frida
602911,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005JLPK,Alistair McHarg,"[6, 6]","Frida is luscious eye candy from beginning to end; so beautiful it could be enjoyed without sound.  This is due to its subject, its star, and its director, Julie Taymor, who also gave us the astounding Titus.  (If you have not yet seen Titus, do so before finishing this review - it is an art director's tour de force on a par with Brazil.)Regardless of where one falls on the political spectrum, one can't help but be intrigued by the fascinating, and certainly unconventional, people of Frida.  Diego Rivera, played superbly by Alfred Molina, boasted the traditional faults of great artists, (narcissism, thoughtless cruelty, obsessive egotism), while showcasing some exceptional ones, (art as propaganda device, naive political idealism).  His flaws were as large as his murals, but he was never dull.In addition to starring as Frida, Salma Hayek co-produced the film and pretty much moved heaven and earth to get it made.  How wonderful that she did.  Hayek has traveled under a Hollywood curse, appearing in one dreadful picture after another.  This is clearly the film she wants to be remembered by, and her performance is note perfect.  The story is so full of pain and passion that it could easily become maudlin and goopy, but Hayek never lets that happen.  Her Frida is heart and steel all at once - amazing.The take home message, if there is one, is that great art is never free.  In the case of Rivera, others paid the price; he fed off others like a greedy child.  In the case of Frida Kahlo, she herself paid the price, digging further and further into her own pain and laying it bare in a way that is almost unspeakably brave.  There are moments of magic realism in Frida, where we move imperceptibly from the filmed image to paintings and vice versa - if nothing else this reveals the paintings for what they were, astounding autobiographical statements.There are a few missteps.  The liaisons with Trotsky and Josephine Baker feel almost obligatory, as if a form is being filled out.  But blemishes this small are overshadowed by so many splendid moments, for example, when Rivera's dog urinates on his painting and he responds by calling him the best art critic in Mexico.Beyond highly recommended - must viewing.",5,Agonized Poetry Visualized Exquisitely,1158364800,"09 16, 2006",2006,2231,"['Frida', 'luscious', 'eye', 'candy', 'beginning', 'end', 'so', 'could', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'sound', 'due', 'subject', 'star', 'director', 'Julie', 'Taymor', 'who', 'also', 'gave', 'astounding', 'Titus', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'Titus', 'do', 'so', 'before', 'finishing', 'review', 'art', 'director', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'par', 'Brazil', 'Regardless', 'where', 'one', 'political', 'spectrum', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'intrigued', 'fascinating', 'certainly', 'unconventional', 'people', 'Frida', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'played', 'superbly', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'boasted', 'traditional', 'faults', 'great', 'artists', 'narcissism', 'thoughtless', 'cruelty', 'obsessive', 'egotism', 'showcasing', 'exceptional', 'ones', 'art', 'propaganda', 'device', 'naive', 'political', 'idealism', 'flaws', 'were', 'as', 'large', 'murals', 'was', 'never', 'dull.In', 'addition', 'starring', 'Frida', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'co-produced', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'moved', 'heaven', 'earth', 'get', 'made', 'How', 'wonderful', 'did', 'Hayek', 'traveled', 'Hollywood', 'curse', 'appearing', 'one', 'dreadful', 'picture', 'clearly', 'film', 'be', 'remembered', 'performance', 'note', 'perfect', 'story', 'so', 'full', 'pain', 'passion', 'could', 'easily', 'become', 'maudlin', 'goopy', 'Hayek', 'never', 'happen', 'Frida', 'heart', 'steel', 'once', 'amazing.The', 'take', 'home', 'message', 'one', 'great', 'art', 'never', 'free', 'case', 'Rivera', 'others', 'paid', 'price', 'fed', 'off', 'others', 'greedy', 'child', 'case', 'Frida', 'Kahlo', 'paid', 'price', 'digging', 'further', 'further', 'own', 'pain', 'laying', 'bare', 'way', 'almost', 'unspeakably', 'brave', 'are', 'moments', 'magic', 'realism', 'Frida', 'where', 'move', 'imperceptibly', 'filmed', 'image', 'paintings', 'vice', 'versa', 'nothing', 'else', 'paintings', 'what', 'were', 'astounding', 'autobiographical', 'statements.There', 'are', 'few', 'missteps', 'liaisons', 'Trotsky', 'Josephine', 'Baker', 'almost', 'obligatory', 'form', 'being', 'filled', 'out', 'small', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'so', 'many', 'splendid', 'moments', 'example', 'when', 'Rivera', 'dog', 'painting', 'calling', 'best', 'art', 'critic', 'Mexico.Beyond', 'highly', 'recommended', 'must', 'viewing']",Frida

In the end Kahlo and Rivera were great artists and poor humanitarians, with a penchant for stupidity.  From this movie you'd think that's a wonderful thing.It must be hard to make movies about artists because there are so few that are that good.  Pollock, Vincent And Theo, Basquiat, Lust For Life, Modigliani, Surviving Picasso all were enjoyable films in degrees; but they all focused on and romanticized some of the worst aspects of the artists' lives like egotism, womanizing, alcoholism, mental illness, and drug addiction, and rarely show the more vulnerable weakness's that was the cause of the problems.

Her relationship with Muralist Diego Rivera is shown exactly how it was: harsh, violent but passionate.

602914,AIA037CW1Y5WT,B00005JLPK,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","Born in Mexico in 1907 just prior to the beginning of the Mexican revolution, Frida Kahlo becomes an icon in the art world after being confined to her bed and forced to find an outlet from what must have been inconceivable pain and torture.  She marries (twice) the famous muralist Diego Rivera who is played by Fred Molina--Rivera is best known for in the US for painting a mural for Rockafeller and having it torn down because he refused to take the image of Stalin out.  At 6 Frida had been diagnosed with polio and suffered from a slightly malformed leg throughout her physically tortured life.  Later, at around 17, she is in a city bus accident and a metal rod found its way through her abdomen and exited via the pelvic region.  Because of all this Frida is at the mercy of well meaning surgeons throughout her life and suffers body casts, odd traction devices and surgeries which in that day might have seemed helpful.  While being confined to her bed Frida's parents supply her with paint and canvas.  That is where the history of Frida's art and the thick of the movie begins.Selma Hayek plays the part of Frida Kahlo from youth to death.  Sparsed in between the performances are hallucinogenic scenes which masterfully depict some of her more abstract representations.  Although I felt the performances forced it did flow better during the 2nd half of the movie.  In addition to the physical suffering she endured Frida also endured Rivera--she said there were two great accidents in her life and one of them was Diego.  I wondered if the movie would depict much of the suffering Frida went through and that it does probably because Hayek produced the film herself.  It also characterizes her (Frida) ideas of transmutation of sorts as it ran in her life as well.  Perhaps the picture could have been aided by more attention to performance as I was left unconvinced in several places.  I do believe Miss Hayek tried to convey Frida's lust for any joy in life and living it for its very base values.

Visually and emotionally arresting, such satisfying films are rare to come by.Young, vivacious Frida Kahlo is crippled in a bus accident. But even though her body turns on her, her spirit comes to life and she resolves to live life to its fullest. Her two greatest companions are the canvas and her husband, passionate and communistic playboy Diego Rivera. Their life together is not so much a rocky road but one littered with mountains. Slowly, her body gets more of a burden as well. Yet through all of that, her art keeps her strong.Frida is such a joy to behold because it invites the audience along to experience all of the aforementioned. Not once are we reminded of the fact that this is a movie. This is the potential of cinema realised; to draw the audience into the world presented before them. Frida Kahlo not only creates her paintings, but we are somehow drawn into the world of the paintings themselves. So we get to explore Frida Kahlo's mind as well as her surroundings, and not only are we dazzled by this tempestuous woman, we also understand her pain and, even more amazingly, her art as a consequence.Salma Hayek is utterly phenomenal in the leading role. She IS Frida Kahlo, not Salma Hayek portraying her. She even looks the part so well that the film often draws the audience into her paintings, through Salma Hayek, and it's hard to spot the difference. Alfred Molina is stunning as her impossible significant other Diego. All of the cast deliver stellar performances, but these two carry the whole ensemble on their shoulders, and they do it with grace.Boy is this a gorgeous film! We don't just see the lavish parties, we take part in them. There is such a feisty passion pumping throughout this entire picture. There is a rich use of warm, delicious colours. Very often, the gap between the world and Frida Kahlo's art diminishes, with spectacular results. This is one wild story, and the two-hour running time feels like it passes in no time at all.

This was a big disappointment, not only is there nothing important stated in the film, but the acting is absolutely horrible.It was an understatement to say that this was pure &#34;torture&#34; to people who want to be intellectually stimulated or at least watch a decent film about someone's life without resorting to that fact that the director wanted us to see Frida as nothing but a &#34;hero and martyr&#34; and a one dimensional character, which is what is conveyed throughout this awful film. Julie Taymor (a pretentious playwright and puppet maker w/ one film to her credit) instead gives us a Hollywood cliche about the artist's life, including meaningless pseudo-surrealist interjections which bring to life some of the paintings in a boring fashion.Hayek is tepid, stale and dull and never really brings any vividness or passion into one of the most vibrant artists of the century, instead, we get to see her breasts about 20% of the time, not that I am against that, but a film should be about something more important that conventional sex scenes which have no point being on the screen and give us feelings into the art and life and relationship with Rivera (played by the dismal Alfred Molina).Taymor is unsure whether she wants to actually let us examine Kahlo's life or merely show us a predictable storyline that doesn't fit anywhere, she meanders through the most &#34;famous&#34; episodes in Frida's life, including her horrific accident and sprinkles a few twists and interpretations. She has a turbulent relationship with Rivera but again, no souls are studied. Trotsky (played by the laughable Geoffrey Rush with a bad Russian accent) has no meaning at all, instead he is nothing but a sex toy which was disgusting to behold on the screen. We feel as if we are watching a bunch of idiots on the screen because not one of the actors hired for this film show any enthusiasm or any acting capabilities, although Antonio Banderas as the artist Siqueiros is the closest thing but he is given only about 2 minutes to work.Painting was an important part of Frida's life but we don't really get to even see her at work here. If you are looking for a literary study of the artist, this is most definately not the place to look. This is a tragic disgrace to the artist, and merely a conventional approach that gives rich Americans, who compromise 97% of the film audience, a chance to say that they know Frida after watching this. After all, it was the American upper middle class that co-opted Frida's works and life and called it their own, to put on t-shirts and mugs. What is sad, as I saw while reading the other reviews of this film, is that people won't know that nothing was actually stated in the film because they are accustomed to mindless Hollywood garbage which just wants to take famous names and make more money so we have people calling this &#34;brilliant and wonderful&#34;. I think a Mexican director with decent actors who know their craft is what is necessary if you really want to make a respectable and credible.

I have seen their actual work and this film brings it back. For people that do not know their story this is an excellent introduction. I found it interesting how Frida (Selma Hayek) and Diego (Alfred Molina) complimented each others personality so well from the beginning until where we leave them.Also the films surrealistic qualities will remind you of ""Like Water for Chocolate"".  Many times this enhances instead of distracting form the reality of the films port ate.  The colors being vibrant and even the music being vibrant fives a three dimensional quality to the film.

Rivera came  to San Francisco in 1940 to execute the Pan American Unity mural for the Golden Gate International Exposition.  Frida Kahlo was a woman ahead of her time in many ways. Especially in light of the times she lived in when women were pretty much expected to be wives and mothers.  One thing lovely about the movie is the gorgeous cinematography that shows off the vibrant colours that Kahlo and Rivera used in their works, as well as the colours that are the basis of Latino life.Watching the movie I like to savor the sound, and simply soak in the visual richness.

The cinematography and art direction are vibrant and colorful, and also weird, maybe to the point of being a little too weird in some scenes. After a bad trolley accident in her youth, Frida spends the rest of her life in various physical pain, and this torment is expressed through her paintings. The director Julie Taymor tries to capture this torment with strange but creative sequences that must be seen because they can't be described here.There are some flaws. Very little context is given surrounding Frida's life; I knew she was mexican, was in an accident, she painted, and her name was Frida. That's it. Something about communism was thrown into the mix. Why? How? Who? I don't know it's all fairly superficial. Next thing you know the famous russian Leon Trotsky enters the movie. What tha?!

602939,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,B00005JLPK,Chris Fung,"[12, 14]","This movie is intense, passionate and visually breathtaking. The sheer breadth of responses to Julie Taymor's beautifully presented work is indicative of the controversy (at least among gringo movie-goers) surrounding Taymor's art, Frida's life and work and Mexican history in the early twentieth century.As an appreciater (but not an avid fan) of Frida's work, I found the movie to be a compelling introduction to Frida's life and her artistic creativity. I was initially unsure about whether Salma Hayek could pull this role off but she certainly does. Her portrayl of Frida is confident, passionate, sensual and creative. Hayek deserves enormous credit for her dramatic work in capturing all these aspects of the real Frida Kahlo and for taking on the role of producing this movie: Let's face it, when have we seen Latinas in Hollywood as anything other than gangbangers, hoochies or Mi Familia-style madres?The emotional core of the movie: that loyalty and fidelity are not necessarily the same, is thought-provoking and slyly subversive at the same time. It's a thoroughly intelligent look at a complex subject that has not been well-explored in previous US movie offerings. One suspects that part of its lack of appeal to the mainstream lies in this one area alone. In my experience, many people prefer myth to reality in emotional situations even more than in intellectual ones.Much has been made of Taymor's ability to create visually arresting art and this movie is chock full of wonderful examples of her ability. From manic Quay brothers cartoons to the slow motion agony of the bus wreck that cripples Frida as a girl, to the hilarious interpolations of Diego as another giant of the early 20th century atop the Empire State Building and the stunning recreations of Frida's paintings as tableaux vivants, I can only say: This film is worth ... a pop for the visuals alone. Forget Star Wars. This is a real work of art.Visually, the movie also captures the brilliance and color of Mexico city at the turn of the century. My girlfriend used to work just around the corner from Frida's house and would go there fairly often (this was long before she -Frida- became a trendy Madonna accessory) and she says that the house and all its details (woodwork, furniture, paintings) were deadly accurate (except for some dimensional changes to the courtyard).Complementing Hayek's performance were a truly excellent supporting cast. In particular, Alfred Molina's superb Diego Rivera, Valeria Golino's Lupe and Roger Rees as Frida's father. Molina portrays Rivera's volcanic and self-absorbed nature with grace and humor. No other male screen actor (with the exception of James Gandolfini) has come close to the convincing, compelling and contradictory range of emotions that Molina has delivered here.Fervent anti-communist ideologues might object to the sympathetic portrayl of leftist politics and Leon Trotsky. However, it is true that Marxism was an integral part of the political scene in early 20th century Mexico. It's fashionable to sneer at the old leftists for being naive and dogmatic but they had real hope that they could change a moribund and corrupt society for the better, and Frida and Rivera were part of that movement. Personally it looks to me like they had a lot more fun with their politics than all those earnest North American and British leftists (with exceptions like Woody Guthrie of course).Finally, whether Trotsky was murderous himself or not, he DID oppose Stalin and his concept of Revolution by Terror, for which he (along with millions of his countrymen and women) paid with his life. The large figures of history sometimes defy simplistic ""The Walton's""-style moralizing.

602940,A256F7E787F5SG,B00005JLPK,Christopher Nieman,"[3, 3]","I was quite impressed by Salma Hayek's single-minded determination to get this film produced in the face of heavy competition from others. She felt destined to play Frida Kahlo, and the film was a labor of love that is evident in every frame. Kahlo's bold and colorful paintings are heavily autobiographical, and so it is unavoidable that the film takes us on a journey through her life and work all at once. As we see events in Kahlo's turbulent life unfold, we automatically understand the content of the artist's paintings as they are presented to us.Hayek also found probably the ideal director in Julie Taymor, who has quickly established herself as one of the most visually gifted filmmakers in the industry. Taymor's handling of the actors is first-rate, as she brings spirited performances from the entire cast. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is equally excellent, with lots of dazzling camera tricks and numerous painting-like shots. The film also benefits from terrific lighting effects, makeup, set design, vibrant costumes, and an outstanding, Oscar-winning score.I was also pleasantly surprised by the film's opening scene, which turns out to be a very clever and unconventional way of introducing Kahlo to the audience ... but you'll just have to see the film to know what that means.My only criticism with the film, and a minor one, is that the pace is almost breathless, and so the film feels more compact than it really should. It almost always rushes like a river when sometimes it should flow more gently.This film clearly belongs to Salma Hayek, and she occupies the role so enormously that it's hard to imagine anyone else taking on the character of Frida Kahlo with as much verve. It's nothing short of a career-defining performance, and her Oscar nomination was well earned.

602943,A1YIYS3J7EQ3F8,B00005JLPK,"C. Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[2, 5]","FRIDA (2002) dir. Julie Taymor.This is essentially an art movie that made it to (some) mainstream theaters and got an Oscar nomination for its star, Selma Hayek. Though Hayek did not win the Oscar (it went to Nicole Kidman for Hours), her rendition of Frida Kahlo character, an early 20th century Mexican painter, was generally worth watching this movie. The kudos, though, go to Taymor, a director of both opera and film, who made this film an outstanding viewing experience-for select audiences.I have to make a qualification to this praise, however.  Taymor stated in her DVD commentary that she did not want to make a film about art, but about the life of an artist-showing the creation of art in the process. But basically, this was the life of an artist that she was attempting, the inner life principally, which was expressed in the art. Thus art defines life, the individual artist's, but also life in general. It was also a movie about love, about a romance, a marriage, and, broadly again, the relation of marriage (life) to art.These are large themes, and they are not necessarily the only ones that the film contains, for the film is complex and themes interrelate and cross over to others as the story progresses, covering a period of about 25 years.What I believe is a flaw is the dramatic structure of the film. As Julie Taymor admits, two hours of film time cannot contain the details of a lifetime. Structurally, the film is episodic, without a discernible plot, other that the ups and down of the relationship of Frida Kahlo with her husband, the painter Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina), their struggles to remain committed to each other, despite his infidelities. The film does well to show the paradox of enduring friendship between two fellow artists of opposite sexes who happen to be married; the marriage fails, the friendship endures; it is not easy, and in the process, the life of Frida, whose physically well-being has been irreparably damaged by an early accident, is practically ruined. Her struggle is to overcome physical tragedy, a failed marriage, and an artistic career that refused to take off while she was alive (she has become famous since).The film progresses along these lines, and has much to commend it: splendid period photography  (despite a limited budget), a tremendous musical score by Elliot Goldenthal, a meticulous relating of the artistic creation to the life events of the protagonist unfolding on the screen, and the sense of vibrance and passion of life-love of life despite the specter of continuous disaster.Structural weakness, though, does occur, for the viewer does not know what to make of the story-is it a romance, life and art, marital discord, feminism, lesbian love,  a diatribe on sex (copulation is not much more that urinating, Diego Rivera insists, eager to rationalize his amoral dalliances), or a broad brush with political ideology? As the movie progresses beyond its middle section, Diego Rivera finds himself in New York, a Mexican communist attempting to depict Lenin on the Rockefeller Plaza; he is fired by an enraged Nelson Rockefeller (Ed Norton), and practically banished from that city. The movie plot opens in new directions, and soon Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush) appears in the horizon, banished from Russia by Stalin, and taking refuge in Mexico. Things get hotter, as Trotsky and Frida embark on untimely romance. Trotsky's wife is present, and the romance of the elderly man-which might have been forgiven if platonic-reveals some lack of taste on the part of the filmmakers, for it is completely pointless and adds nothing to the mystique of the legendary fugitive from the Soviet Union, a man who clearly saw world evil figures equally divided (though different in kind) between Stalin and Hitler. The film's polemics are half-baked and not thought through, thus harming the overall artistic result. Tragic romance in one thing; delving into politics and taking no sides (was the communist Rivera a menace or not-was his art corrupt?) makes the film not ambiguous in that sense, but confused and confusing. Art relating to personal life is a well-wrought theme, and perhaps it would have sufficed. Frida's courage to endure and survive (and win) despite her handicaps-these are all well taken points.  But the politics in the story lacks clear direction-we do not know, for instance, why and how a communist artist becomes corrupt by his wrong ideology (if that is the word), or whether his ideology does not matter if he is a good artist. On the other hand, Frida's art is allowed full play, her daring innovations are given enough space and a sensitive treatment as images on the screen, and her innovativeness (Breton called her a surrealist artist) and boldness in expressing inner states in disturbing imagery-these are well made points. Though the film is not preoccupied with feminism, Frida, the character, comes through as a woman artist whose odyssey may have carved a new way for female artists but also for women in general. Bill Moyers  has called this movie heroic and said that ""Women see in it a hero's journey.""  Frida Kahlo fully qualifies for such a description: She has the courage to defeat (though not entirely) physical disability, she has the courage of her convictions as an artist and never compromises, and she can stand up to the brutally a more and more famous male counterpart (Rivera), and boldly surpasses him in originality and talent. She dies as defiantly as she has lived.In this sense, the film does superbly. We get a female artist's struggles with illness, bad luck, misfortune, betrayal, and rises above it all. Subtract politics, or incorporate it more organically, and you would get an overall superb movie. As it is, this movie is worth seeing.  The whole may not be perfect, but most of the parts are brilliant.",4,"Biography, art or politics?",1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,5841,"['FRIDA', '2002', 'dir', 'Julie', 'Taymor.This', 'essentially',

She has shown that she can take a project from beginning to end without missing a step.I am also a painter, and have always been particularly touched by Frida Kahlo's ability to channel years of physical and emotional suffering into a body of lyrical and stunning work. Hayek's performance captures the complex nature of Kahlo's personality. Alfred Molina is wonderful as Diego Rivera. So often Rivera has been depicted as a one dimensional bad guy, but Molina's performance reflects a more nuanced understanding of this brilliant artist. He may have been a singularly flawed individual; but his reputation as one of the world's greatest muralists in unassailable.

The beginning is not boring; I was convinced I had to own this DVD within the first twenty minutes. The writing is brilliant and moving. Most biopics fall into the trap of being a mere chronology of events. This one succeeds where most fail: it is a story. The characters are all rich, deep, real, and thereby completely loveable. Of course it is probably scientifically impossible to not find Salma Hayek loveable. In this film, though, everyone shines. Trotsky, Diego's ex-wife, even the bar musicians radiate with human beauty. Salma Hayek has shown the world that she is quite capable of taking the lead in a serious role.

To the contrary, the film was teeming with wonderful visual references to Frida's multifaceted and colorful life, from the family members, pets and belongings she held dear, to the unique clothing and jewelry for which she was known, and the neighborhoods and houses where she lived.  Perhaps the Post reviewer was not sufficiently familiar with the context to appreciate these details, which were recreated with such passion and fidelity that for me the film needed little else.  I also felt the film effectively portrayed the torment Frida suffered over her lifelong love for Diego Rivera, (...), yet emotionally and professionally supportive, husband.  That Diego's art overshadowed hers for most of their lives was of far less consequence to her than his marital infidelities.  I personally would have enjoyed seeing the film do more with Frida's series of magical, and often tragic, self-portraits; this is a woman who suffered such crushing chronic back pain (due to a horrific bus accident) that she often painted while bedridden in the hospital for months on end, and at other times had to tie herself into a chair to paint.  Painting was her therapy and she literally painted her love and her pain in images of herself, Diego, her broken body parts, and the plants, objects and creatures that brought her comfort.

The performances here are all good, bringing the characters to life vividly. Most vivid of all, however, are the exceptional performances of Hayek as Frida Kahlo and the underrated Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera. Hayek's Frida embodies all the traits that must have made Frida a force of nature... strong, the iron will to live and conquer while still extremely fragile and vulnerable. Frida was a woman of contradictions, as any even cursory look at her body of work will evidence, and Hayek illustrates these contradictions beautifully.Interestingly, before this film's theatrical release, I read a review in Playboy magazine, which seriously credited ED NORTON as playing Diego Rivera! Oh yes, despite Edward Norton's versatile gifts as an actor, there is NO WAY he was playing the rotund, Mexican painter. (At the time I was quite appalled that a well-respected, big budget magazine like Playboy could print something so egregiously wrong. Where are the copy editors???) Alfred Molina breathes Diego Rivera, artist at work, loving but voracious husband incapable of fidelity. (Frida never demanded fidelity since it was a standard to which she herself wasn't capable; when Diego's womanizing crossed into family territory-he seduced Frida's sister Cristina-Frida decided enough was enough.)The cast is superb (I love Geoffrey Rush as Leon Trotsky), the script (helped along considerably by Edward Norton) excellent, the scenery and cinematography and soundtrack all gorgeous, producing the inevitable effect of tempting the viewer into visiting Mexico City for him or herself. Going to Coyoacan to see Frida's home and works is worth the trip all by itself, but the whole Coyoacan neighborhood is bohemian, artistic and enjoyable, just like this beautiful and moving tribute to a woman and force of nature, Frida Kahlo.",4,brought to life,1110585600,"03 12, 2005",2005,2020,"['Visually', 'stunning', 'work', 'took', 'many', 'years', 'get', 'funding', 'script', 'rights', 'fact', 'testament', 'sheer', 'force', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'will', 'drive', 'determination', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'good', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life', 'vividly', 'Most', 'vivid', 'however', 'are', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'Hayek', 'Frida', 'Kahlo', 'underrated', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'Hayek', 'Frida', 'traits', 'must', 'have', 'made', 'Frida', 'force', 'nature', 'strong', 'iron', 'will', 'live', 'conquer', 'still', 'extremely', 'fragile', 'vulnerable', 'Frida', 'was', 'woman', 'contradictions', 'even', 'cursory', 'look', 'body', 'work', 'will', 'evidence', 'Hayek', 'contradictions', 'beautifully.Interestingly', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', 'read', 'review', 'Playboy', 'magazine', 'seriously', 'credited', 'ED', 'NORTON', 'playing', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'Oh', 'yes', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'versatile', 'gifts', 'actor', 'WAY', 'was', 'playing', 'rotund', 'Mexican', 'painter', 'time', 'was', 'quite', 'appalled', 'well-respected', 'big', 'budget', 'magazine', 'Playboy', 'could', 'print', 'something', 'so', 'egregiously', 'wrong', 'Where', 'are', 'copy', 'editors', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'breathes', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'artist', 'work', 'loving', 'voracious', 'husband', 'incapable', 'fidelity', 'Frida', 'never', 'demanded', 'fidelity', 'was', 'standard', 'was', ""n't"", 'capable', 'when', 'Diego', 'womanizing', 'crossed', 'family', 'territory-he', 'seduced', 'Frida', 'sister', 'Cristina-Frida', 'decided', 'enough', 'was', 'enough', 'cast', 'superb', 'love', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Leon', 'Trotsky', 'script', 'helped', 'considerably', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'excellent', 'scenery', 'cinematography', 'soundtrack', 'gorgeous', 'producing', 'inevitable', 'effect', 'tempting', 'viewer', 'visiting', 'Mexico', 'City', 'Going', 'Coyoacan', 'see', 'Frida', 'home', 'trip', 'whole', 'Coyoacan', 'neighborhood', 'bohemian', 'artistic', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'tribute', 'woman', 'force', 'nature', 'Frida', 'Kahlo']",Frida

The lives of artists during periods of transition are often the most illuminating distillations of those contradictory impulses.  So it was with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, who stood at the crossroads of so many forces and events -- Trotsky's fleeing the descent of communism into terrorism, the art of social realism foundering on the demands of its capitalist patrons, the uneasy compromises of conservative Latin culture with the undercurrents of its inherent sensuality.This movie virtually throbs with the colors, sounds, and urgent seekings of an era that knew an old world had ended and that a new one was trying to be born.  It was a prolonged birthing, and we now know it was to bear a demon.  Artists seem more attuned to the forebodings of disaster than the rest of us, and this brooding sense of impending doom is the palpable shadow that dances over the vivid color, boisterous motion, and fleeting joys of Frida Kahlo's life.This movie has its flaws, but they pale into insignificance against its achievement in evoking the sense of an era that has never been satisfactorily explained by historians or social scientists.  You can add up all the things that went wrong between World War I and World War II.  You can take a stab at cause and effect.  You can blame the winners or the losers of World War I.  But it's one of those eras for which you simply had to have been there to grasp what it was all about.  Two movies have helped us get there.  ""Cabaret"" was one.  ""Frida"" is the other.

Also not dealt with, were her attempted suicides, which I think may perhaps have portrayed her as a weak person if they were simply glossed over, which she wasn't.Definitely a beautiful and impressive film, and one I would recommend.

Kahlo was near death.Be warned, there is a lot of sex and nudity. There is also a lot of blood, and a particularly graphic scene involving an embryo. Those familiar with the career of Kahlo will not be surprised at this. Those unfamiliar may wince at all of this.On the plus side, there are some really cool visual effects involving some puppetry and other low-tech graphics, as you might expect from The Lion King's Julie Taymor. Pay close attention to the paintings in the movie.All in all, I personally found a visually beautiful movie which dangerously smelled of lacking a plot. Point-of-view changes constantly from narration to observation. If the unsuspecting moviegoers keep the kids at home, turn their heads during the grosser parts, and do not expect a strict biopic, I think they may find it, at the very least, interesting.

It is not that Frida was ugly, but she did not look so stunning, neither. Second, Kahlo had such a crippled body she was in constant pain. It is the representation of her physical and mental pain that makes Kahlo's paintings so powerful, but Hayek totally overlooks this, and instead portrays the painter as a physically healthy woman, who can even climb pyramids.These and other inaccuracies made me give the film four stars only.

The girl-on-girl dancing scene was electric.  So was Frida's date with a lady at a New York City diner.  Antonio Banderas' appearance was mercifully short.  The ""artful dream"" sequences gave something to the Fellini crowd and the memory of Kahlo as an artist.  And the narrative may have been too conventional for some, but to me it was a welcome relief that paced the film along wonderfully (would you prefer 2 hours of dialogue on the merits of Trotskyism?).

The movie is based on the life of Frida Kahlo, the famed Mexican artist, who was married at the age of 22 to her mentor and much-older friend Diego Riviera, Communist, mural painter, philanderer...perhaps the most recognizable Mexican artist in the world.The movie FRIDA is as extraordinary as Salma Hayek's performance.

Qualls,"[2, 3]","Julie Taymor's portrayal of the life of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo breaks away from conventional biopics and occasionally enters what seems to be the inside of the artist's surreal mind. Still, the film doesn't seem much different from most biopics.Salma Hayek is fine as the famed painter, but she fails to play such a complex character on more than one level. However, she does capture Kahlo's beauty, and does well when her character is acting passionately. Alfred Molina is also adequate as the repeatedly unfaithful husband - you almost believe him when he says that ""[sex] doesn't mean anything!"". The film is also peppered with rather small supporting roles, all performed well enough: Ashley Judd as Italian expatriate Tina Modotti, Antonio Banderas as rival Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, Geoffrey Rush as the Russian exile Leon Trotsky, Edward Norton as greasy bourgeios American Nelson Rockefeller, and the exceptional Valeria Golino as Lupe Marin, Rivera's ex-wife.Elliot Goldenthal's intriguing musical score plays over the absolutely gorgeous Art Direction and Set Direction by Bernardo Trujillo and Hannia Robledo, respectively. The film is a visual and audial cinematic triumph.However, Taymor's direction straddles between avant-garde moviemaking and conventional melodrama. The screenplay, by a collaboration of writers, fails really to delve into the characters' inner-feelings, especially of the title character, despite the frequent, lively trips inside her mind.

Tender and vulnerable one moment, she can become fiery and self-confident the next. Hayak also captures much of the excruciating physical torment that Frida was forced to endure during her lifetime - and which often became the central subject of much of her art. Alfred Molina makes of Rivera a fascinatingly understated figure. His seeming world-weariness camouflages a tenderness and ability to love deeply, which, apparently, few in his life - apart from Frida - were ever able to see. Ashley Judd does a nice turn as one of Rivera's socialite devotees and Antonio Banderas makes his mark in his very brief appearance as David Siqueiros, a passionate socialist who accuses Rivera of kowtowing to the powers-that-be whom he claims to despise (Banderas is so good in the role that one regrets he isn't given more screen time). Geoffrey Rush, unfortunately, is not given enough time or good material to make much of an impression as Trotsky.Taymor has had mixed results integrating Frida's works into the story. The director occasionally dabbles in surrealism by having Frida and Diego literally enter into the world of her paintings. Sometimes it works; sometimes it serves merely as a fancy distraction.

What troubled me with this movie was my inability to connect with it.I expected to be drawn into Frida's character and to be able to understand who she is and what her motivations are, but I found the film lacking that explantion of her character.It became apparent to me that in order to fully enjoy this movie, you have to be familiar with the life and circumstances of Frida and you have to identify with her character prior to watching the film.This was my mistake, as I watched the film, knowing little more about Frida than that she was a painter.  To me the film unfolded as a series of events in ""someone's"" life.  It was like watching the home videos of a stranger (well, that is overexaggerating quite a bit, but you get the point), it is just a few events in Frida's life that I had no connection with.The one scene I could connect with was the death scene.  I felt more of the movie should have followed the same style as that scene.  While watching that scene, I finally felt involved in the movie, instead of being a spectator.  Frida lives an interesting life, but if I can't connect with her character, then I can't really enjoy the movie.So, in conclusion, this is a well-crafted film, but it assumes that you are familiar with and have an interest in Frida, which I am not and do not.  So, don't be an idiot like me and use this movie as your introduction to Frida.  Do your homework on her first.",3,"3.5 Stars.

I knew that the film was directed by Julie Taymor (Titus), which meant that it would have a striking visual style.  I knew that the movie starred Salma Hayek and that she had wanted to play this role for years.  I knew that it had been nominated for 6 Academy Awards including a Best Actress nomination for Hayek.  But I did not know anything about the subject of the film.Frida is a biopic focusing on the life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek).  As much as the movie focuses on the life of Frida, it seemed that the main thrust of picture was on Frida's relationship with her husband, painter Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina).  The film does cover Frida's life from her childhood right up to her death.  We begin the movie when Frida is a young woman aspiring to be a painter.  Her father is highly supportive of her dreams.  However, she is riding on a trolley one day when it gets into an accident.  She has to be in a body cast for some time and it was in doubt whether she would ever walk again.  She recovers, but she lives a life of pain.  Frida meets the womanizing painter, Diego Rivera and they get married.  This does not mean that he changes his ways and naturally this causes problems in their marriage.  They remain committed to each other even when they are each sleeping with other people.  Over the course of the movie we see Frida painting, but it seems that Frida the artist gets pushed to the side and we see Frida the woman/wife.  I don't know enough about Frida Kahlo to know if this is a flaw in the movie or not, but it is just the way the movie is.The acting in this movie is superb.  Nothing feels wrong or forced.  But, surpassing even the excellent acting is the visual presentation of Frida.  Her artwork appears throughout the movie, but not simply as paintings hanging on the wall.  Kahlo's artwork appears first as a painting, but that painting transforms into the scene itself.  This also works the opposite way in that a scene will end up as a painting and the transitions between the two are so smooth it is very impressive.I was very impressed with Frida.  I didn't care for Julie Taymos's other film (Titus), so I didn't know what to expect.  Everyone (Hayek, Taymor) exceeded my expectations for the movie.  This was a very good movie.",5,Wow!

He was perhaps Mexico's most celebrated artist & leader of the Communist party as was Frida in the 30's. He was a serial cheat & knowing this Frida became his third wife. Frida: ""Will you always be faithful?"" Diego: ""I will always be loyal.""  To his chagrin, she become good friends with his second wife. She was a better artist than he but not nearly as well known. He received a commission from Rockefeller. She sublimated everything for her husband's career & traveled with him to the US, probably to keep an eye on him. He could have been internationally famous but would not soften his communism, & lost his commission. She also traveled to France. The movie claims she had an affair with Leon Trosky.

She had always desired her own show but that did not happen until she was bed-ridden & near death.There is a lengthy interview extra on the dvd with Salma Hayek. She is beautiful & seems very nice.

Taymor tells a riveting saga about Frida Kahlo and her life, that seems faithful to those familiar with the artist's biography.

The film sizzles when both actors appear together on screen. If there is a false note - even if it is true - it is Kahlo's bizarre, seemingly inexplicable love affair with Soviet emigre Leon Trotsky, which the film suggests was Kahlo's means of getting even with Rivera's excessive philandering.

Another major thread is the involvement of both with the Communist Party. In the latter half of the film, Geoffrey Rush makes an appearance as the exiled Leon Trotsky running from Stalin's death squads.Hayek's performance is the finest I've seen by an actress so far in 2002. An Oscar nomination is surely in the cards. Though I understand that FRIDA uncovers nothing new about the life of Kahlo not already known by devotees of her work, the film was a total revelation for me who knew nothing about the artist. And Costuming and Make-up built on Hayek's natural appearance to create the spitting image of the real Frida (whose photo I've just seen on the Web).Visually, the film is a riot of color. I especially liked those scenes where the viewers' eyes are drawn to a brightly costumed Frida set against surroundings colored with contrasting sepia and/or pastel tones.My only picky-picky complaint about FRIDA is its treatment of Kahlo's physical condition after the horrific 1925 bus accident that left her with multiple fractures of her pelvis, spine, ribs and leg, and which necessitated over 30 follow-up operations in her lifetime. The visual force of her paintings is generated both by her complex emotional life as well as the terrible physical pain she constantly suffered. Yet in the film, between that time she learns to walk again without a crutch and much later when she climbs an Inca pyramid with Trotsky, there's absolutely no hint in Hayek's portrayal that the artist was in any way physically debilitated beyond an inability to bear children. Where was the stiffness of movement, or the inevitable grimaces of pain? At one point, Kahlo is shown dancing with the fluidity of perfect health. As one afflicted with yet only mild arthritis in the lower back, I found this aspect of Salma's characterization perhaps unreal.

It would hardly be possible to make a dull movie about Frida Kahlo. She lived in a fascinating, turbulent period in history, incidents which are duly noted in the script, and was surrounded by fascinating people, many of whom are superbly portrayed in the film, notably the outrageously talented Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera and Geoffrey Rush as Leon Trotsky. Director Julie Taymor, of Broadway's Lion King, has an eye for colorful and stirring visuals, and even the occasional dissolves into fantastic tableaux based on Kahlo's paintings work.The major problem, alas, is Hayek. One would like to admire her performance unreservedly given her sincerity in fighting to get this picture made. She bears a startling facial resemblance to the real Kahlo and does capture both the woman's mordant humor and her extremes of passion. What she does not capture is the physical Frida Kahlo. Here was a woman whose body was nearly destroyed when she was a teenager, a woman most of whose life was marked by constant, crippling physical pain. Barely a trace of this is evident in Hayek's Kahlo, who walks with hardly a limp, dances, climbs Mayan pyramids and bares her buff body in love scenes with both men and women. Give the scriptwriter credit for not shying away from Kahlo's bisexual nature, but the lesbian scenes have the polished aura of softcore porn, and do a disservice to the rest of the picture.It's good that a passable, interesting film biography of this great artist and woman got made.

602982,A1WTYALNQNQG99,B00005JLPK,Larry L. Looney,"[2, 3]","Julie Taymor is in the driver's seat for this wonderful look at the life of Frida Kahlo, one of the greatest artists of the 20th century - but this is a collective effort in the truest sense of the term.  Selma Hayek, who turns in what is very likely the performance of a lifetime as Kahlo, is listed as an executive producer - and the contributions of all involved in this masterful film are important and noteworthy.  The cast and crew have managed to tell the story not only of the romance between Kahlo and the great Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, but also of a time and atmosphere that we will - sadly - unlikely see again.The Revolution in Russia - and the possibilities it presented for the working classes worldwide - lit a fire in the hearts of many, igniting hopes and passions for a better world.  Each person touched by this flame saw it illuminate their life and their work in an individual way - and artists were certainly no exception.  Diego Rivera's murals are legendary and timeless testaments to that passion.  The passion that stirred between Rivera and Kahlo is a legend of its own - Frida knew full well before she even met Diego of his reputation as a womanizer.  The love the blossomed between them drew them together despite - and very likely because of - the things that existed within each of them that, in many relationships, drive people apart.Taymor's film uses incredibly beautiful - and moving - images to augment the live action.  Many of these are taken from Kahlo's works - there are a couple of scenes in which one of Frida's paintings is transformed into live action, to wonderful effect - and some are completely original, created especially for the film.  A couple of these latter scenes are based on traditional images from the Mexican Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), and are chillingly effective - and not without humor.The horrific accident which left Kahlo's body damaged for life certainly didn't kill her spirit - and it is this spirit, combined with the innate talent she possessed for turning her inner feelings into art, that make her work eternally relevant and inspiring.  We all carry around pain inside of us that accumulates over the course of our lifetimes - Frida found a way to access that pain, to make it visible to others, to express it and process it.  We could all learn a lot from her.

602985,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JLPK,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 2]","Bravo for this 2002 film that brought the life and times of the artist Frida Kahlo to life!Starring Salma Hayak in the title role, the audience is treated to a visual feast of her colorful and pain-filled life.  I've always admired Ms. Kahlo's paintings and yet never knew anything about her.  Now, its all here, and Julie Taymor, the director, uses the backdrop of Mexico and the colors of the sun to tell this inspiring story.Born in 1907, Frida was only fifteen years old in 1922 when she was seriously injured in an accident.  Her back was shattered and a steel rod had pierced her body. For the rest of her life she was never free of pain.  And yet she managed to direct her agony into magnificent works of art.The acting is outstanding, and Salma Hayak really was able to translate the complexities of role onto the screen.  Alfred Molina was cast as Diego Rivera, a fellow artist who loved her completely but could never stay faithful.  Together, the couple light up the screen with their passion and jealousy, which lasted a lifetime.  Frida had love affairs of her own, with women as well as men, and the romantic scenes keep the screen sizzling.  It's also clear how directly her pain is translated into her art.Mexico itself was also a star of the film.  It seethes with beauty and political intrigue.  And the sunshine colors are a perfect backdrop for the tempestuous romantic story.  There are also some scenes in Paris and in New York and the director managed to convey a time and a place that once really existed and now is remembered with nostalgia.  The political climate also comes to life, as Frida ad Diego were Marxists and had optimistic visions of changing the world for the better. In retrospect it all seems nave, but the times were alive with the turmoil of preconceived concepts being challenged.I loved the film, loved the characters and was caught up in the story.

Just to name a few: Geoffrey Rush, playing Trotsky; Antonio Banderas, playing Siqueiros; Edward Norton (also co-responsible for the screenplay), playing Nelson Rockefeller; and Ashley Judd, playing sexy photographer Tina Modotti, who plays alongside Hayek one of the most erotic scenes to be shot in quite a while: a tango dance to the song ""The Blue Room"", composed by scorer Ellieot Goldenthal and magically sung by Lila Downs. Needless to say, then, that the casting was superb.The script was based on a book by Hayden Herrera, but the screenplay was very well accomplished (kudos to this new facet of Ed Norton!) reminding at several points of the magical realism in the movie ""Like Water For Chocolate"" -spiced up with sexy and funny moments, the core of the story always revolves around Frida's tormented life which was filled with accidents and suffering, from her bus accident in her younger years to all the pain she went through her life, both in her body and her soul (largely due to Diego Rivera's sexual adventures outside their marriage).There are plenty of moments where the editing is simply marvelous: moving from shots of a painting seamlessly into a moving shot where Frida would be wearing the clothes of the painting. This is one peculiar and attractive feature the movie resorts to periodically to showcase some of Frida's work, while retaining the attention of the viewer and the flow of the story in a very clever way. Also the score (read my review about it) is outstanding.The movie won't fit the tastes of people who get easily shocked with openly lesbic performances, but if you can set any prejudices to the side (which you should), you are bound to enjoy a great ride, which I am sure will put both, Taymor and Hayek, on a new level as director and actress, from here on out.",5,"Great performance by Salma, great movie!",1037923200,"11 22, 2002",2002,1929,"['Julie', 'Taymor', 'back', 'three-year', 'hiatus', 'Titus', 'direct', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'cast', 'super-stars', 'Frida', 'name', 'few', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'playing', 'Trotsky', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'playing', 'Siqueiros', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'also', 'co-responsible', 'screenplay', 'playing', 'Nelson', 'Rockefeller', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'playing', 'sexy', 'photographer', 'Tina', 'Modotti', 'who', 'alongside', 'Hayek', 'one', 'most', 'erotic', 'scenes', 'be', 'shot', 'quite', 'while', 'tango', 'dance', 'song', 'Blue', 'Room', 'composed', 'scorer', 'Ellieot', 'Goldenthal', 'magically', 'sung', 'Lila', 'Downs', 'Needless', 'say', 'then', 'casting', 'was', 'superb.The', 'script', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'Hayden', 'Herrera', 'screenplay', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'accomplished', 'kudos', 'new', 'facet', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'reminding', 'several', 'points', 'magical', 'realism', 'movie', 'Water', 'Chocolate', '-spiced', 'up', 'sexy', 'funny', 'moments', 'core', 'story', 'always', 'around', 'Frida', 'tormented', 'life', 'was', 'filled', 'accidents', 'suffering', 'bus', 'accident', 'younger', 'years', 'pain', 'went', 'life', 'body', 'soul', 'largely', 'due', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'sexual', 'adventures', 'marriage', 'are', 'plenty', 'moments', 'where', 'editing', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'moving', 'shots', 'painting', 'seamlessly', 'moving', 'shot', 'where', 'Frida', 'would', 'be', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'painting', 'one', 'peculiar', 'attractive', 'feature', 'movie', 'periodically', 'showcase', 'Frida', 'work', 'retaining', 'attention', 'viewer', 'flow', 'story', 'very', 'clever', 'way', 'Also', 'score', 'read', 'review', 'outstanding.The', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fit', 'tastes', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'easily', 'shocked', 'openly', 'lesbic', 'performances', 'can', 'set', 'prejudices', 'side', 'should', 'are', 'bound', 'enjoy', 'great', 'ride', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'put', 'Taymor', 'Hayek', 'new', 'level', 'director', 'actress', 'here', 'out']",Frida

And of course, Salma Hayek in her amazing breakthrough performance is fantastic as bisexual Mexican artist Frida Kahlo--the film is engrossing and mesmerizing.Shot in and around the Mexico City locations where Kahlo, her husband, Diego Rivera, and their lovers lived and played, ""Frida"" brilliantly captures the brightness of the light, the intensity of the colors and the omnipresence of Mexican motifs that informed Kahlo's art. Director Taymor has smartly avoided the traps that make so many films about artists irritating, and the even bigger traps inherent in a biopic of a figure like Kahlo, who became the center of a feverish Sylvia Plath-like victim-cult in the '80s. Taymor eschews the standard Kahlo martyrology, emphasizing instead her triumph over physical and emotional agony, her humor and joie de vivre. And she makes the love that Kahlo shared with Rivera the real subject of the story.Taymor captures both the glamorous, deeply cosmopolitan milieu Kahlo and Rivera inhabited, and the importance Mexico had in the '30s for the international left. The only thing that lets down the feeling of authenticity is the odd accents adopted by cast members like Judd, Valeria Golino (who plays one of Rivera's ex-wives) and Geoffrey Rush.Overall, however, this is an ultimate triumph for Hayek.

602990,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B00005JLPK,Mary Whipple,"[8, 8]","Artist Frida Kahlo's paintings are a visual diary of her life--as a revolutionary, as the wife of Diego Rivera, and as a woman in constant pain.  Injured in a bus accident as a young woman, she endured over thirty surgeries, unremitting physical agony, and injuries which left her unable to bear a child, but she also endured the pain of a notoriously unfaithful husband.  As she once told him, ""There were two big accidents in my life.  You are the worst.""Salma Hayek, as Frida, is both tough and vulnerable, showing Frida's spontaneous, physical approach to life and her passionate dedication--to Diego, to her hard-edged paintings, and to communist philosophy.  Alfred Molina, as Diego, a man who ""belongs only to himself,"" is warm, funny, often protective, and utterly impossible as a husband.  An established muralist with many commissions when he first meets her, he encourages her artistic goals, explaining, ""I paint what I see--the world outside.  You paint from your heart.""  Married, divorced, and later remarried, Frida and Diego, as we see them here, are both mutually supportive and mutually destructive.Hayden Herrera's biography of Frida is the basis for the Clancy Sigal and Diane Lake screenplay, which emphasizes Frida's pain and her ways of dealing with it--through drink, her work, and through sex, with both women and men, including Leon Trotsky, in exile in Mexico.  The settings from the 1920s and 1930s are brilliantly colorful--a bright blue house with a garden of peacocks, monkeys, and colored birds;  the worksites of Rivera's passionate and brightly colored murals;  and locations in Mexico City and New York.  Lively Mexican music plays throughout, with new music (Elliot Goldenthall) inserted to unify scenes, the piano music being especially memorable.  The cinematography (Roderigo Prieto) takes full advantage of the architecture and the color, which is enhanced by the vibrant clothing, jewelry, and hair adornments worn by Frida.Director Julie Taymor features many of Frida's paintings, and some of Diego Rivera's murals throughout, using them to connect the artists' inner and outer worlds.  On several occasions, however, there are jarring intrusions of cartoons and nightmares--people walk through a photograph, which shifts to black and white;  King Kong in a film morphs into Diego Rivera;  a trip to New York becomes a walk through travel brochures.  Unfortunately, the style of these vignettes is so unexpected and foreign to the tone of this film that they feel intrusive, even arch.  Hayek and Molina are outstanding in conveying the torment of Frida and Diego Rivera, however, and the film, overall, is a fascinating study of two artists living through the tumult of history and each other.

602991,A3PA0W1VUDU4J7,B00005JLPK,Mat,"[3, 7]","(...)When Frida was released into theatres I had absolutely no desire to see it. I'm neither a fan of Salma Hayek, biopics in general, and biopics about artists especially. Add to that my zero knowledge about the artist Frida herself and the movies fate was sealed into never being seen by the likes of me. However, my general lack of new movies here in France and being able to borrow it from a friend for free helped me to reconsider watching it. When I realized it was directed by Julie Taymor who also directed a marvelously beautiful version of Titus then I was actually excited by it (almost).Like Titus, Frida is an amazingly visual movie. Taymor, who is known mainly for her Broadway adaptation of the Lion King, has an artists eye for visual flair. She has found away to take something as static as a painting and made it alive. Throughout the film she recreates several of Frida's works and makes them a part of the action. It's impossible to explain on paper (or cycberspace) but what she creates is something pure magic.I can't say how accurately Frida is portrayed in this movie. The picture we get is of a rather flawed woman who lived with a great deal of suffering. Her suffering comes in both physical ways (stemming from an accident early in life) and emotionally (from a cheating husband and her own mistakes). Yet it is this suffering that creates such remarkable art. Taymor manages to create an interesting and moving story within her excellent images.Both Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina pull out excellent performances. I was especially impressed with Molina portraying the very flawed and yet sympathetic Diega. I had pretty much written this actor after playing Doc Oc in the highly overrated Spiderman 2. But here he shows a real sensitivity to his character. Don't be fooled by the billing of this film.

Throughout her adult life, she also dealt with constant physical pain caused by a near fatal traffic accident. She was one of the most remarkable women of the 20th Century. The film is a visually dazzling work but is brought down a notch by a script which never completely captures her essence. The life of a brilliant artist is admittedly difficult to convey, due to the genius, eccentricity and ego involved, and ""Frida"" does manage to come close to achieving its loft goals.Selma Hayek gives a masterful, heartfelt performance as Frida, as does Alfred Molina as Diego. What inspires us, however, is the direction by Julie Taymor, whose colorful and amazing visuals tell us much about how Frida may have viewed the world. Taymor, I feel, is as much an artist as her subject. The script may waver and meander, but Taymor's direction shows that she innately understands who and what Frida was. She almost manages to make the script's flaws seem superfluous.For lovers of art in all its many forms, ""Frida"" is a must.",4,Hit and miss script but a visual triumph,1056067200,"06 20, 2003",2003,1172,"['Frida', 'biography', 'famed', 'Mexican', 'artist', 'Frida', 'Kahlo', 'own', 'triumphs', 'were', 'overshadowed', 'tempestuous', 'love', 'affair', 'muralist', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'adult', 'life', 'also', 'dealt', 'constant', 'physical', 'pain', 'caused', 'near', 'fatal', 'traffic', 'accident', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'women', '20th', 'Century', 'film', 'visually', 'dazzling', 'work', 'brought', 'down', 'notch', 'script', 'never', 'completely', 'essence', 'life', 'brilliant', 'artist', 'admittedly', 'difficult', 'convey', 'due', 'genius', 'eccentricity', 'ego', 'involved', 'Frida', 'manage', 'come', 'close', 'achieving', 'loft', 'goals.Selma', 'Hayek', 'masterful', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'Frida', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Diego', 'What', 'however', 'direction', 'Julie', 'Taymor', 'colorful', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'tell', 'much', 'how', 'Frida', 'may', 'have', 'viewed', 'world', 'Taymor', 'feel', 'as', 'much', 'artist', 'subject', 'script', 'may', 'waver', 'meander', 'Taymor', 'direction', 'innately', 'who', 'what', 'Frida', 'was', 'almost', 'make', 'script', 'flaws', 'seem', 'superfluous.For', 'lovers', 'art', 'many', 'forms', 'Frida', 'must']",Frida

Everything came out, and although some of her paintings were very strange, some of them could make your heart break.Frida's relationship with Diego, (played by Alfred Molina, who put on 50lbs to play the role) is complicated at that. He regularly cheated, she yelled, she threw him out, only to discover she couldn't live without him. It's a love that stayed, despite the cheating, and she did her fair share too.There's a whole host of recognisable faces in this, including Antonio Banderas in a blink-and-you'll-miss-him role, and Ashley Judd, Also, the gorgeous Valeria Golino, who I recognised from Rain Man, and is just as gorgeous as she was then.Frida is a very emotional film, but it's not that memorable after finishing it.

When she realizes she might have talent as an Artist, she demands of Diego Rivera, the most famous of Mexican painters at the time, to know the truth: tell me if I am wasting my time painting, tell me the truth, she says. Rivera encourages her in her art and before long they become lovers, though Rivera is much older and a big mountain of a man prone to womanize, yet obviously in love with Frida.The visuals are awe-inspiring, which comes as no surprise to anyone who knows Taymor's previous work in ""Titus"" and ""The Lion King."" But here, Taymor takes her vision one step further by bringing many of Frida's paintings to life by presenting them as tableaux vivantes.Much is made of the political climate in Mexico at the time (1920's) and many famous people (Nelson Rockefeller, for one) are trotted out, but it is the relationship of Frida and Diego that is at the core of this film. Hayek and Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera are fascinating to watch and accomplish something that is very difficult: they make living, breathing, feeling human beings of these historical figures.

While still in school, Frida (Salma Hayek) is severely injured in a trolley accident from which she would never fully recover. She lived the rest of her life in pain as a result of the innumerable broken bones she suffered in that accident. Determined to earn a living in spite of her physical condition, she asks artist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) to tell her if her work is good enough to sell. Rivera admires Frida's work very much and takes her on, at first as a protege, then as a lover, then as a wife. The film follows Frida and Rivera's relationship over the course of 25 years of marriage, divorce, and remarriage. We witness Rivera's artistic success and then commercial failure in the United States. And we see Frida's success abroad and, finally, at home in Mexico as she always wished, but which came only shortly before her death. Frida Kahlo's life was haunted -if not consumed- by pain and loss. It was shaped by a fateful accident in her youth. Ironically, if not for the accident, she probably would never have painted. And since she did, we can see the conditions under which she lived expressed in her many paintings.""Frida"" is based on Hayden Herrera's biography of Frida Kahlo and is filmed in a largely conventional biopic style in spite of its unconventional subject. At times, Salma Hayek is admirable in her ability to convey how much Frida Kahlo's constant physical pain shaped her life and work. At other times, Hayek's Frida is too agile to be a self-described cripple.  The film does not shy away from depicting Diego Rivera's or Frida Kahlo's Marxist political convictions. But it does place Diego Rivera in a more sympathetic light than I usually see him described. I was under the impression that he was considerably more self-obsessed and dogmatic than he is in ""Frida"". But I find no fault with Rivera's character in the movie since the film sees Rivera through his wife's eyes, which love may have blinded to some of his faults.  Salma Hayek is a great admirer of Frida Kahlo and produced ""Frida"" herself. Many of her Hollywood friends contributed by taking small roles in the film.

This was a big disappointment, not only is there nothing important stated in the film, but the acting is absolutely horrible.It was an understatement to say that this was pure ""torture"" to people who want to be intellectually stimulated or at least watch a decent film about someone's life without resorting to that fact that the director wanted us to see Frida as nothing but a ""hero and martyr"" and a one dimensional character, which is what is conveyed throughout this awful film. Julie Taymor (a pretentious playwright and puppet maker w/ one film to her credit) instead gives us a Hollywood cliche about the artist's life, including meaningless pseudo-surrealist interjections which bring to life some of the paintings in a boring fashion.Hayek is tepid, stale and dull and never really brings any vividness or passion into one of the most vibrant artists of the century, instead, we get to see her breasts about 20% of the time, not that I am against that, but a film should be about something more important that conventional sex scenes which have no point being on the screen and give us feelings into the art and life and relationship with Rivera (played by the dismal Alfred Molina).Taymor is unsure whether she wants to actually let us examine Kahlo's life or merely show us a predictable storyline that doesn't fit anywhere, she meanders through the most ""famous"" episodes in Frida's life, including her horrific accident and sprinkles a few twists and interpretations. She has a turbulent relationship with Rivera but again, no souls are studied. Trotsky (played by the laughable Geoffrey Rush with a bad Russian accent) has no meaning at all, instead he is nothing but a sex toy which was disgusting to behold on the screen. We feel as if we are watching a bunch of idiots on the screen because not one of the actors hired for this film show any enthusiasm or any acting capabilities, although Antonio Banderas as the artist Siqueiros is the closest thing but he is given only about 2 minutes to work.Painting was an important part of Frida's life but we don't really get to even see her at work here. If you are looking for a literary study of the artist, this is most definately not the place to look. This is a tragic disgrace to the artist, and merely a conventional approach that gives rich Americans, who compromise 97% of the film audience, a chance to say that they know Frida after watching this. After all, it was the American upper middle class that co-opted Frida's works and life and called it their own, to put on t-shirts and mugs. What is sad, as I saw while reading the other reviews of this film, is that people won't know that nothing was actually stated in the film because they are accustomed to mindless Hollywood garbage which just wants to take famous names and make more money so we have people calling this ""brilliant and wonderful"". I think a Mexican director with decent actors who know their craft is what is necessary if you really want to make a respectable and credible.

I should clarify that I use the term to mean movies about great artists (as opposed to what used to be the term to describe movies coming out of France and Scandanavia).  The reason for my reluctance is that, if the art itself doesn't impress me, then the movie probably won't either.  However, I recently watched ""Amadeus"" for the first time and was greatly impressed.  So, when I saw ""Frida"" on IFC's schedule, I thought I'd take a chance on that one as well.  Thank goodness that I did.  This, too, is an impressive movie.I will admit that I knew nothing about the true-life artist, Frida Kahlo, although I vaguely recognized the name of her husband, Diego Rivera.  I'm sure that ""Frida"" must have been an exceptional experience for those who were already fans of her work before the movie came out.  However, I was impressed that prior knowledge of the woman was not a requirement for being able to enjoy ""Frida"".  The impact of the movie came from its' portrayal of the artist first and the art second.  Frida Kahlo was a vibrant woman who overcame many things because of her passion for life and love.  She backed-off for no one, even her wandering husband.  She overcame a serious accident that left her in pain and follow-up surgeries most of her life.  She did not compromise on expectations of anyone, including herself.  All of this we saw through the excellent directing of Julie Taymor and the Academy Award-nominated acting of Salma Hayek in the title role.  I did not see Nichole Kidman in ""The Hours"" so I can't complain too loudly about the injustice of Hayek not winning the award.  Let's just say that, if and when I get around to seeing ""The Hours"", I'll be expecting a lot.The use of art in ""Frida"" was expected but the unique ways that it was blended in were exceptionally well-done.  History plays an important role in ""Frida"" as well with the assassination of Leon Trotsky (gee, I sure hope I'm not giving anything away with that) being a special focal point for me.""Amadeus"" excelled in how it brought the man, the music and the times to life.

603015,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B00005JLPK,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[43, 56]","From the top it is a love story, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.We meet Frida as a high school student just before a tragic and life-changing bus accident which leaves her in constant pain for the rest of her life.Diego is perhaps 20 years her senior, is already a successful mural painter. divorced and bedding anyone with big breasts.But what makes it a extraordinary movie is that the director tries to capture the essence of Frida and her art with the movie itself. Pieces are animated and sequences built around her particular paintings. The technic draws the watcher into the artisitic world far better than a strict narrative. Nicely done and effective, somehow he communicates to me, an absolute anti-art idiot, through the media some of the essential Frida.The movie is a riot of color, everywhere, from the changing colors of her dresses, the walls of her home (his is red, hers is blue?, with a skybridge joining them), to the colors of the scarves she braids into her hair. Like color the move is full of sex, straight sex, lesbian sex, sex with models, sexy dances, breasts in murals, naked models, Frida as pain wracked in a body cast but sexy.... Then we have politics, Trotsky, Mexican revolutionaries, comrades singing late into the night, protest parades.And passionate drinking, and dancing, and flower gardens. lust all the way down....But this is all secondary to PASSION. sex, hungry pushy grabby horny sex but not so much as animal lust followed by exhaustion but sex as symptomatic, as pointing to; the real passion for life, despite the pain, despite a unfaithful husband (""you were never a husband to me"") who knew only loyalty to his painting. That is what the movie is about. The passion of a women- Frida Kahlo- in love with life as few people ever are. Most of us are blobs, pieces of animated meat, seldom rising above the level of sentience to trackle the big questions. That is the theme of the movie, to communicate this passion for life that effected everyone around her. Certainly built around her relationship with Diego, with storm and tears, tender late life hugging to temper tantrums galore, always colored by her (and his) art. Walls full of art, from a picture of a young Mao to a mural destroyed because of Lenin's face within it.The big questions: relationship of art to real life, Mexican unjustice and unequal distribution of wealth and therefore opportunities, the right to sensual pleasure free of constraints, the relationship of one woman to one man. This are touched on, but peripherally, even with the affair with Trotsky, it is her passion that draws people to her bed, figuratively and literally.Art communicates differently than does science. Art doesn't use words the same way as prose; straightforward, literal, linear, logical. Rather Art is like poetry; confused, non linear, non verbal, expressive, colorful, sexy, progressive, emotional. The movie, like the woman, is artist(ic). It hits you in a different place than does thinking about something, for it is about identifying with someone, understanding them. I could read a biography of Frida, i might even be able to page through a book of her paintings, but i don't think i would have the same feelings afterwards as i have now having seen the movie. Logic and reason are not the only ways of knowledge, words and books are not the only way to transmit information, this movie shows another way: emotional, raw, images, feeling for someone. Certainly i know these things are manipulated to create a movie, but underneath the need to sell tickets, for the director to get his next movie and his next paycheck, is a bigger, more important issue of what it means to be human. what it means to let out the things inside, to express the creatively, the desire, the needs, the passion inside. And that is the genius of this movie, true to Frida's real personality or not, it shows, and better yet, allows us to experience one special woman's life.

603016,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JLPK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 5]","Frida (Julie Taymor, 2002)Within the first few seconds of Frida's opening, it's obvious to anyone who's seen Titus that this is a Julie Taymor film. I've never seen that particular shade of blue anywhere but on Tony Hopkins' face.Frida opens riskily. The first part of the film is, not to put too fine a point on it, boring as all get-out. However, somewhere in the midst of all the boredom, Taymor is seducing the viewer, and by the time you get to the movie's first unforgettably surreal image (after the trolley accident, with Salma Hayek covered in blood and powdered gold), you're hooked for the rest of the movie. And not just because Ms. Hayek spends so much of it unclothed, either (finally fulfilling a collective male fantasy in existence since From Dusk Till Dawn).Hayek plays Frida Kahlo, husband Diego Rivera is played by Alfred Molina (recently on the big screen in Identity), and the movie centers around the two's volatile marriage. Rivera seems incapable of being faithful, which drives Kahlo's art deeper into the subconscious depths of pain and misery her art achieved. And yet still, somehow, the two of them love one another enough to keep trying to make it work, over and over again. Well, at least it made for great art.The movie is also powered by a number of fine cameos, from Edward Norton to Antonio Banderas to Geoffrey Rush to Saffron Burrows and a whole lot of places in between. Add the trademark dadaesque scenes one expects from Taymor, and the film ends up being quite fine. Certainly worth a screening. *** ",4,Good stuff.,1071100800,"12 11, 2003",2003,1542,"['Frida', 'Julie', 'Taymor', '2002', 'first', 'few', 'seconds', 'Frida', 'opening', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Titus', 'Julie', 'Taymor', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'particular', 'shade', 'blue', 'anywhere', 'Tony', 'Hopkins', 'face.Frida', 'riskily', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'not', 'put', 'too', 'fine', 'point', 'boring', 'get-out', 'However', 'somewhere', 'midst', 'boredom', 'Taymor', 'seducing', 'viewer', 'time', 'get', 'movie', 'first', 'unforgettably', 'surreal', 'image', 'trolley', 'accident', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'covered', 'blood', 'powdered', 'gold', ""'re"", 'hooked', 'rest', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'Ms.', 'Hayek', 'so', 'much', 'unclothed', 'either', 'finally', 'fulfilling', 'collective', 'male', 'fantasy', 'existence', 'From', 'Dusk', 'Till', 'Dawn', '.Hayek', 'plays', 'Frida', 'Kahlo', 'husband', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'played', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'recently', 'big', 'screen', 'Identity', 'movie', 'centers', 'two', 'volatile', 'marriage', 'Rivera', 'incapable', 'being', 'faithful', 'Kahlo', 'art', 'deeper', 'subconscious', 'depths', 'pain', 'misery', 'art', 'achieved', 'yet', 'still', 'somehow', 'two', 'love', 'one', 'enough', 'keep', 'trying', 'make', 'work', 'over', 'again', 'Well', 'least', 'made', 'great', 'art.The', 'movie', 'also', 'powered', 'number', 'fine', 'cameos', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'whole', 'lot', 'places', 'Add', 'trademark', 'dadaesque', 'one', 'Taymor', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'quite', 'fine', 'Certainly', 'screening', '***']",Frida

The film takes us at the center of the art world in one of the most tumultuous alliance between two painters, an alliance filled with joy and heartbreak, love and betrayal...Frida and Diego are two dynamic artists of extraordinary and diverse talents... While Diego's work is more public and monumental, Frida's paintings are grotesque and intimate on a much smaller scale...The film chronicles Frida's audacious self-introduction to the great muralist Diego Rivera, and her physical ailments... There is pain in this woman's life, a pain she don't deserve to have, a pain no one deserves to have... There's a line in the film where Kahlo says, 'at the end of the day, we can all endure much more than we think we can.' and I think this one line resumes everything about her...Salma Hayek proves herself that she's more than just another pretty face... Salma is full of vigor as the angry strong-willed female artist caught in a net of pain... It's pleasing to see Hayek in a production where she is totally confidant, sexy and lusty in an uncomplicated way... Salma captures the spirit of Frida and plays it with heart and style, longing for the healing touch... She dances a provocative tango with Ashley Judd, and goes to Paris to explore her bisexual side...The chemistry between Salma and Molina is terrific... Her passion for art is overtaken by her passion for him... She expresses her emotions by teasing him, by playing practical jokes, by exciting the jealousy of his wonderful wife, Lupe Marin (Valeria Golino).But Frida remains in Rivera's shadow... She calls herself ""a charming amateur."" She focuses on her expressive self portraits of her physical pain, anger, and disappointment... Yet while viewers are left with the impression that there is undoubtedly more to Frida's life than what appears on screen, what we get instead is a love story, a tale of Frida's romantic, and tempestuous union to the unfaithful husband she marries twice and never stopped to love...London-born actor Alfred Molina is absolutely splendid as the lovable Rivera... He is a well-known womanizer who can never be faithful to any woman... Diego is a painter of conviction... A revolutionary painter who believes in Frida's anguished brush, and championed her work... He decides to create paintings which would speak directly to the common people...In a motion picture that sweeps from the late 1920s into the 1950s, Julie Taymor proves to be a director of taste and sensitivity... She captures the mood of the moment with genuine flair and style... Her imagery is exciting, and we are convinced that we are seeing Mexico in the first half of the 1900s, with its native markets, textiles, music, and food... Julie Taymor infuses it with elements of Frida's artistic creativity, bringing much of her work to life... Her film was nominated for six Academy Awards...Vague references to the political struggle between Trotsky and Stalin make their way into the script... The film ignores Siqueiros' central role in the unsuccessful attempt on Trotsky's life in 1940... But the motion picture details the mistake of Nelson Rockefeller commissioning Rivera a huge fresco for his public hall...",4,"Julie Taymor, a director of taste and sensibility...",1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,3357,"['rich', 'passionate', 'account', 'two', 'celebrated', 'Mexican', 'artists', 'lives', 'were', 'bound', 'up', 'major', 'events', '20th', 'century-the', 'Mexican', 'Russian', 'Revolutions', 'film', 'center', 'art', 'world', 'one', 'most', 'tumultuous', 'alliance', 'two', 'painters', 'alliance', 'filled', 'joy', 'heartbreak', 'love', 'betrayal', 'Frida', 'Diego', 'are', 'two', 'dynamic', 'artists', 'extraordinary', 'diverse', 'talents', 'Diego', 'work', 'more', 'public', 'monumental', 'Frida', 'paintings', 'are', 'grotesque', 'intimate', 'much', 'smaller', 'scale', 'film', 'Frida', 'audacious', 'self-introduction', 'great', 'muralist', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'physical', 'ailments', 'pain', 'woman', 'life', 'pain', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'have', 'pain', 'one', 'have', 'line', 'film', 'where', 'Kahlo', 'end', 'day', 'can', 'endure', 'much', 'more', 'think', 'can', 'think', 'one', 'line', 'everything', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'Salma', 'full', 'vigor', 'angry', 'strong-willed', 'female', 'artist', 'caught', 'net', 'pain', 'pleasing', 'see', 'Hayek', 'production', 'where', 'totally', 'confidant', 'sexy', 'lusty', 'uncomplicated', 'way', 'Salma', 'spirit', 'Frida', 'heart', 'style', 'longing', 'healing', 'touch', 'provocative', 'tango', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Paris', 'explore', 'bisexual', 'side', 'chemistry', 'Salma', 'Molina', 'terrific', 'passion', 'art', 'overtaken', 'passion', 'emotions', 'teasing', 'playing', 'practical', 'jokes', 'exciting', 'jealousy', 'wonderful', 'wife', 'Lupe', 'Marin', 'Valeria', 'Golino', '.But', 'Frida', 'Rivera', 'shadow', 'charming', 'amateur', 'expressive', 'self', 'portraits', 'physical', 'pain', 'anger', 'disappointment', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'impression', 'undoubtedly', 'more', 'Frida', 'life', 'what', 'screen', 'what', 'get', 'instead', 'love', 'story', 'tale', 'Frida', 'romantic', 'tempestuous', 'union', 'unfaithful', 'husband', 'twice', 'never', 'stopped', 'love', 'London-born', 'actor', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'absolutely', 'splendid', 'lovable', 'Rivera', 'well-known', 'womanizer', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'faithful', 'woman', 'Diego', 'painter', 'conviction', 'revolutionary', 'painter', 'who', 'Frida', 'anguished', 'brush', 'championed', 'work', 'create', 'paintings', 'would', 'speak', 'directly', 'common', 'people', 'motion', 'picture', 'late', '1920s', '1950s', 'Julie', 'Taymor', 'be', 'director', 'taste', 'sensitivity', 'mood', 'moment', 'genuine', 'flair', 'style', 'imagery', 'exciting', 'are', 'convinced', 'are', 'seeing', 'Mexico', 'first', 'half', '1900s', 'native', 'markets', 'textiles', 'music', 'food', 'Julie', 'Taymor', 'elements', 'Frida', 'artistic', 'creativity', 'bringing', 'much', 'work', 'life', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'six', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Vague', 'references', 'political', 'struggle', 'Trotsky', 'Stalin', 'make', 'way', 'script', 'film', 'Siqueiros', 'central', 'role', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'Trotsky', 'life', '1940', 'motion', 'picture', 'details', 'mistake', 'Nelson', 'Rockefeller', 'commissioning', 'Rivera', 'huge', 'fresco', 'public', 'hall']",Frida

On one hand, they admire the way the whole film itself looks like some of her paintings, but they are upset with the fact that it focuses more on her sex life than anything else.While this may be true, there are more than enough strong elements in this film to make it a dazzling success and, in my opinion, one of the best films of 2002.Director Julie Taymor seems to have mastered the art of mise-en-scene with this film.  Everything the viewer is subjected to is nothing short of stunning.  Like Kahlo, Taymor uses a palate with so many different colors to shade this film.Salma Hayek, who championed this project, gives the performance of her career.  Whether she is playing the young, awkward, teenage Kahlo at the beginning of the film, the sassy and bold Kahlo in her twenties and thirties, or the frail, aging, yet determined Kahlo at the end of the film, Hayek is always convincing and intense.As good as Hayek is, Alfred Molina, as Diego Rivera, all but steals the show.  Molina has to be one of the most underrated actors out there.  He perfectly captures the eccentric, moody, yet extremely lovable artist that Rivera was.  Having put on tremendous weight for the role (or just wearing lots of padding), Molina portrays Rivera as an inspirational and lovable ladies man.  How the Academy didn't even give him a nomination is beyond me.Geoffrey Rush appears later in the film giving yet another excellent performance, this time as the Russian exile Trotsky.  In addition, look for great cameos by the likes of Edward Norton, Ashley Judd and Antonio Banderas.Some may be put off by FRIDA, thinking it to be just another biopic about a dead artist.  This film is much more.  Rivera was the communist party chairman for some time in Mexico and got into some trouble for his beliefs when he was in the US for a  while, so besides giving the viewer insights to different aspects of Kahlo's life, this film also touches on the politics and history of not just Mexico, but the entire world during the 1930's and 1940's.This is an important and daring film that comes off incredibly well.

What she was not quite so successful in overcoming was her strenuous love/hate relationship with Rivera, which came to occupy her time and her life almost as much as her painting.  In many ways, ""Frida"" is a typical artist bio, highly reminiscent of other recent films in the genre such as ""Pollock"" and ""Surviving Picasso,"" both of which also dealt with the serial philandering of their male artist figures.  ""Frida,"" however, since it is focused more intensely on the woman's perspective, offers a few new insights into that seemingly inevitable theme.  Frida, in many ways, prides herself on her independent, fiery nature, yet when Rivera becomes a part of her life, she quickly succumbs to his seductive charms.  She marries Rivera even though she knows he is constitutionally incapable of remaining faithful to her.  Thus, she sets herself up for a life of misery with a man she is utterly incapable of living without.  That the relationship is one of utter co-dependency is demonstrated by the fact that Rivera, even after their numerous breakups, keeps coming back to his one true love.Based on the Hayden Herrera biography, the Clancy Sigal/Diane Lake/Gregory Nava/Anna Thomas screenplay doesn't paint Frida as some sort of passive victim of her own weaknesses nor as some sort of plaster saint martyr who was entirely guiltless in her own troubled life.  We see, for instance, the hypocrisy inherent in her own romantic dalliances, principally her bisexual flings with other women and even the affair she conducts with none other than Trotsky himself during the period of his exile in Mexico (right before his assassination).  We empathize with Frida because she functions as such a compelling figure in the context of the story, but we are never allowed to forget that she is a flawed human being, as capable of making a mess of her life as any of the men who generally occupy the lead position in these stories.If for no other reason, ""Frida"" is worth seeing for the marvelous sense of history it provides, chronicling the turbulent period of the 1920's and 1930's when socialism was the ""in"" cause for the art world to rally around - at least until the arrival of Stalin when the pipe dream of a worker's state and a classless society fell victim to the murderous brutality of a regime more totalitarian in nature than the one it had replaced.  Director Julie Taymor keeps the political issues of the era front and center, perfectly integrating them with the tumultuous relationship at the story's core.  We witness, for instance, Rivera's struggle with Nelson Rockefeller when the latter commissions Rivera to paint a mural in one of his buildings.  When Rockefeller, the personification of capitalism, balks at Rivera's glorification of Lenin in the painting, Rivera is forced to reexamine his own commitment to the cause he so vehemently espouses (the film makes an interesting companion piece to ""The Cradle Will Rock"" from a few years back).  We also get to see some of the lip service paid by these artists to the socialist cause, as they live the good life among the elite pampered classes, often at the expense of the very workers whose rights they so loudly proclaim in their work.As Frida, Hayek literally carries the film.  Tender and vulnerable one moment, she can become fiery and self-confident the next.  Hayak also captures much of the excruciating physical torment that Frida was forced to endure during her lifetime - and which often became the central subject of much of her art.  Alfred Molina makes of Rivera a fascinatingly understated figure.  His seeming world-weariness camouflages a tenderness and ability to love deeply, which, apparently, few in his life - apart from Frida - were ever able to see.  Ashley Judd does a nice turn as one of Rivera's socialite devotees and Antonio Banderas makes his mark in his very brief appearance as David Siqueiros, a passionate socialist who accuses Rivera of kowtowing to the powers-that-be whom he claims to despise (Banderas is so good in the role that one regrets he isn't given more screen time).  Geoffrey Rush, unfortunately, is not given enough time or good material to make much of an impression as Trotsky.Taymor has had mixed results integrating Frida's works into the story.  The director occasionally dabbles in surrealism by having Frida and Diego literally enter into the world of her paintings.  Sometimes it works; sometimes it serves merely as a fancy distraction.  Still, Taymor at least deserves credit for boldness in such scenes.All in all, ""Frida"" provides a fascinating portrait of its heroine - and one of the best performances of the year to go along with it.",4,gripping Hayek performance,1039219200,"12 7, 2002",2002,5236,"['Salma', 'Hayek', 'uni-brow', 'genuinely', 'great', 'performance', 'Frida', 'Mexican', 'artist', 'who', 'more', 'famous',

It took her many years to get this film made and it was worth the wait. Frida Kahlo had a bus accident that shattered her entire life and would continue to pain her throughout her life. She then met and married Diego Rivera, a fellow artist. She felt she could change his cheating ways, but in the end couldn't, and when she realized this she went into a downward spiral. Then, towards the end of her life she realized that painting was her one true love in life and she becomes a sensation. Of coarse Diego comes back to her because they were meant for each other. The music is fantastic and the costumes are to die for. Alfred Molina deserved an Oscar nomination, but didn't get one. The rest of the supporting cast is brilliant, especially Valeria Golina and Ashley Judd. Salma Hayek and Julie Taymor [director] are at their personal best. It's a shame Salma never recieved a single award for her performance. She has recieved my award though. She was just flat out amazing.

The entire film--performances, music, visuals, explodes with passion and colour. We see Frida from her beginnings as an impetuous schoolgirl and her first introduction to future husband Diego Rivera, to her death at age forty-seven. In between we are priviledged to Frida's unique perspectives of life, love and art, everything drenched in vivid colours, ripe with possibility, a tango of pain and passion.The cast includes many high-profile names, such as Salma Hayek, Alfred Molina, Geoffry Rush, Ashley Judd, Antonio Banderas, and Edward Norton. I am amazed at how well Julie Taymor (the Lion King Broadway musical) has captured the feel of Mexico during the early-to-mid 20th century:  the revolutionary atmosphere, inequalities, the textures and smells of everyday life.The most impressive part of the film for me was the music and visuals. The soundtrack includes a liberal dose of traditional Mexican tunes and singers, including Chavela Vargas, a legendary folk singer and one of Frida's real-life lovers. It was incredibly powerful to see the weathered face of Vargas as she serenades Salma's Frida; one can only imagine what memories she was recalling of her time with the real Frida.

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[1, 1]","I was taken back by surprise this afternoon while watching this spectacular film protraying the life of the Mexican surrealist artist of Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek). I now wonder why I neglected to see FRIDA earlier as it has been playing at a local cinema for many weeks. But what I can say for sure is that I was the one who missed out by not enjoying it sooner. The chronological events of Frida's life are brilliantly combined with images of her paintings actually coming to life on the screen and becoming an independent entity apart from their creator. One can view many autobiographical elements of Frida's life that were included in her artwork. I sympathized with Frida for the obstacles she had to face, including being seriously injured in a trolley accident that left her handicapped. With that being said, I felt no sympathy for her when her husband, Diego Riveria, cheated on her since she was well aware of his 'habits' when she married him.

This also holds for her slightly better known husband, the early 20th Century Mexican painter Diego Rivera.Scenes open and close like soldiers passing by in a parade.

Too often Khalo is dismissed as strange and kranky both in her relationships and her art. For me it has never been enough that the art world simply labels her as a ""surrealist"". Here Hayek plays Khalo as the passionate, caring, pained genius she was. The film endevours to display her agonies through accidents, infidelities, dissapointments and differences. She plays the head strong feminist and communist, a woman passionate about her nation and it's values, traditions and beliefs, a woman agonising to love her family while plow her own trough. A woman uniquely skilled in her creativity and brave enough to tell of her pain and development on canvas. Hayek is a brilliant leading lady and completely dominates the film with Frida's passion and personality, there are other strong roles, Molina and Rush are superb but they never detract from Hayek. The cinematography is delicious and the music is both appropriate and engaging. It's a shame this film didn't get a better run and better audiences.

I don't speak French, but knew some basic details about Frida & Diego Rivera, had heard of the dust-up with Rockefeller and had seen Rivera's murals in Mexico City, so was able to follow most of the plot. Next day I ordered the DVD & played it in English) over & over again till the fabulous music score & the song ""Burn this bed, Burn it blue..."" rang in my head for days.The film is visually stunning (from the vibrant colours of the locations and costumes to Frida's paintings), the characters fascinating & the music score haunting.It is set in the lively world of culture & society in Mexico between the two World Wars - a hotbed of politics, music, literature & avant-garde art - everybody who was anybody in the 1930's went to Mexico for a good time. It focuses on the tumultuous life of the Mexican-born artist Frida Kahlo, who was married to the larger-than-life muralist Diego Rivera.Frida's work is very surrealist, very personal, exotic, original and unforgettable. The director Julie Taymor has done a wonderful job of suggesting how Frida's life experiences melded into her painting. Lesser artists since have imitated Frida's style, but none of them have portrayed the inner world of pain and blood as Frida did.Taymor's commentary on the DVD is valuable for the additional insights it provides on Frida's art, life and times.There are only 5 films produced so far in the 21st century that are worth the time it takes to watch them & I no longer recall what the other 4 are.A beautifully illustrated coffee-table book ""Frida Kahlo"" was produced to accompany an exhibition of Kahlo's work at the Tate Gallery in London in 2005.

Alfred Molina is also amazing and the supporting cast (which includes Ashley Judd, Antonio Banderas, Ed Norton and Geoffrey Rush) also put out impressive performances.

While the reasons might not interest anyone but me, the fact is, this movie touched me and moved me deeply. For starters, it is a gorgeous film to watch. The seamless integration of live actors into Kahlo's stunning and evocative work is a magical joy to behold and adds even more depth to the artist's brutally candid art. Secondly, Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina deliver top notch performances and most impressive may have been Hayek who is on screen nearly the entire time. I can forgive the vanity hiring of Ashley Judd and Edward Norton as their portrayals are less than the aforementioned two, but this is a minor issue. Lastly, regarding the dvd features and what-not, the second disc is mostly behind the scenes featurettes on the making of the movie whereas the special features on the first disc have lengthy interviews that are illuminating and candid while demonstrating the love Hayek and Taymor have for Kahlo.I am not a Frida Kahlo scholar by any means nor do I wish to convey any knowledge of her art, life, politics, or anything else. I know that I find her paintings to be vivid and mesmerizing and that's enough for me. I am grateful to this movie for giving me an introduction to an artist whose work I have grown fascinated with and I am furthermore glad that I have a little knowledge, albeit Hollywoodized, of this remarkable human being.

On the other hand, she lived a life of physical and mental torture. Knowing that she lived during a time where people had to ""tough it up or die"", I felt an amazing awe and admiration for the dynamic, colorful life that this tiny and brave creature led. She had a resolve and an amazing inner strength that few of us might have, given her situation.Even so, watching this movie is difficult because I still wanted it to be a happy life for someone so exceptionally gifted, yet the despair, pain, and the sadness of her life was the very source of her inspiration in her paintings. Without it, who knows what kind of an artist she would have been regarded as -it was the very life blood of her work. Her tumultuous relationship with Diego Rivera, whom I both admire but totally dislike, was a source of true love and pain. A serial womanizer, Rivera was an unfortunate choice to hitch her wagon to, but when it comes to the matters of the heart, sometimes there's nothing one can do but hope for the best. Even so, there's no doubt that the two of them were crazy about each other but it was a painful and seriously dysfunctional union, to say the least.I suppose that's the disconnect that I and maybe others feel when thinking about Kahlo's life and work -there's a polarizing effect going on that is both disturbing and fascinating that follows her to this day.I love the final scene, as strangely morbid (but beautiful too) as it is, and the use of her art in effect sequences of this film. It lends a sort of playful but mournful tone to the film, not unlike Kahlo's life.",4,Anyone who has suffered any kind of pain in life will connect with Kahlo,1400803200,"05 23, 2014",2014,1678,"['Frida', 'lived', 'life', 'was', 'blessed', 'cursed', 'was', 'blessed', 'charisma', 'drive', 'talent', 'other', 'hand', 'lived', 'life', 'physical', 'mental', 'torture', 'Knowing', 'lived', 'time', 'where', 'people', 'had', 'tough', 'up', 'die', 'felt', 'amazing', 'awe', 'admiration', 'dynamic', 'colorful', 'life', 'tiny', 'brave', 'creature', 'led', 'had', 'resolve', 'amazing', 'inner', 'strength', 'few', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'situation.Even', 'so', 'watching', 'movie', 'difficult', 'still', 'wanted', 'be', 'happy', 'life', 'someone', 'so', 'exceptionally', 'gifted', 'yet', 'despair', 'pain', 'sadness', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'source', 'inspiration', 'paintings', 'who', 'what', 'kind', 'artist', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'regarded', '-it', 'was', 'very', 'life', 'blood', 'work', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'whom', 'admire', 'totally', 'dislike', 'was', 'source', 'true', 'love', 'pain', 'serial', 'womanizer', 'Rivera', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'choice', 'hitch', 'wagon', 'when', 'matters', 'heart', 'sometimes', 'nothing', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'hope', 'best', 'Even', 'so', 'doubt', 'two', 'were', 'crazy', 'other', 'was', 'painful', 'seriously', 'dysfunctional', 'union', 'say', 'least.I', 'suppose', 'disconnect', 'maybe', 'others', 'feel', 'when', 'thinking', 'Kahlo', 'life', 'work', '-there', 'polarizing', 'effect', 'going', 'disturbing', 'fascinating', 'day.I', 'love', 'final', 'scene', 'strangely', 'morbid', 'beautiful', 'too', 'use', 'art', 'effect', 'sequences', 'film', 'sort', 'playful', 'mournful', 'tone', 'film', 'not', 'Kahlo', 'life']",Frida

I don't think Selma Hayek is a great actress -- beautiful woman; a beautiful presence, and there's lots of feeling in her performance here -- but, Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera acts rings around her.  He's the linchpin of the movie; he inhabits this role completely and he IS Diego Rivera.  Selma Hayek's performance as Frida can't compare to that type of acting.  She's ""like"" Frida Kahlo, but she's still Selma Hayek playing Frida Kahlo.Some scenes are brilliantly conceived (particularly, the bus accident and its aftermath).  The film tries hard to show the vibrant connection between Frida's art and Frida's life, but these moments give way in favor of a more standard, Hollywood-ized feel, especially toward the end of the film.  Also, Frida's politics are ignored, in favor of her love/hate story with Diego.  She was a much richer character, with a much more fascinating life, than this film can encompass.Julie Taymor does bring some of the flavor of Frida's life to the screen.  The film is enjoyable.

While recovering, she painted Miscarriage in Detroit, the first of her truly penetrating self-portraits. The style she evolved was entirely unlike that of her husband, being based on Mexican folk art and in particular on the small votive pictures known as retablos, which the pious dedicated in Mexican churches. Rivera's reaction to his wife's work was, however, both perceptive and generous: ""Frida began work on a series of masterpieces which had no precedent in the history of art - paintings which exalted the feminine quality of truth, reality, cruelty and suffering. Never before had a woman put such agonized poetry on canvas as Frida did at this time in Detroit""Rivera has exhibitions and work in America but the mural he did for Rockefeller in New York was

courtyards of municipal buildings and the ebb and flow of their love.She embodied alegria-lust for life and displayed an extrovert, black humour and sharp wit behind her unibrowed features,concealing her vulnerability and extreme sensitivity.Although a surrealist,her painting is realistic,down to earth,depicting real images in the most literal way.Her art interweaves fact and fantasy, both equally real.Her art is intensely personal, visionary about sensations,statements of mind and feelings of pain.Her only exhibition in Mexico comes before her death, when she is carried into the gallery.Rivera

At first I thought she was too beautiful to play Frida but, with the exception of her nude scene when you see what a gorgeous woman she is, she completely inhabits the pain and despair of her character.And this film really deepened my appreciation for Alfred Molina.  What a great actor.  He totally brings Diego Rivera to life.(I remember Molina getting killed by bamboo spikes in the opening of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK--yeah, that was him!  He was also in CHOCOLAT with Johnny Depp, PRICK UP YOUR EYES with Gary Oldman.  I just saw him in LUTHER with Joseph Fiennes and Peter Ustinov.  The guy's great and he's been in more than you think.  Plus, you'll see him as Doctor Octopus in the next SPIDERMAN).One of the main reasons I saw this film was that it had been directed by Julie Taymor.  If you liked FRIDA, see what she does with Shakespeare's TITUS with Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange.  She has a very unique, vibrant style.When I first started watching FRIDA, I thought of another film about a woman suffering at the hands of a great artist: SURVIVING PICASSO.  I found that film interesting but ultimately dry.  Picasso came off as such a thoroughly egotistical, selfish man, I found it hard to care about him.But, by the end of FRIDA, I felt quite a bit for both Frida and Diego.

603048,A3N0E03AQD128O,B00005JLPK,Tony Thomas,"[1, 4]","The film Frida and the accompanying background material here is a visual entertainment that seems to be oriented with the current fascination with her art as an expression of inwardly turned, self-referential, and pyscholoigcal concerns that seem to pass as social concern these days. The acting, direction, and production design here are all masterful. Yet, there seems to be a simplification to enable glorification.  Frida emerges as a saint, a heroine, but not a real person.People I knew who knew her 1938-1942 and the biographies that were written about her before she began to be taken up by the New York hipsters, tended to talk about how the pain and difficulty of her life were expressed in a personality that was not exactly the sweet, sunny, firm clear, fair and always just character portrayed in the movie. The condition created by the Frida Fad of the past 10 years has made her into such a non-person, such a glorified abstraction, that otherwise serious grownups who have no real knowledge other than she is now popular and ""collectable"" wince when you tell them people world wide for their warmth, judgement, and trust who saw her every day for years could say that Frida was not always fun to be around. No less than the Diego depicted in her film, Kahlo did not really understand the consequences her own personal picadillos and adventures could have on people who had more conventional views of life and love, and who needed stability in life.The movie and the accompanying DVD background material were either false or ignorant about why Trotsky moved out of the Blue House.  He did not move out because of Natalia Sedova's anger over the affair. [ The affair really break Natalia's heart and almost caused a split among the Trotskys, although that split was healed. Trotsky is almost rapsodic in his diary when he realizes his love for Natalya is there emotionally and physically and they are still together.] Trotsky and the Riveras split due to a deep and public political disagreement over elections in Mexico. Diego was making public statements that gave people the impression that Trotsky was backing a right-wing candidate for President of Mexico that Trotsky stridently opposed. Moroever, Diego's actions gave the false impression that Trotsky was publically intervening in Mexican politics, something Trotsky resolutely refused to do.  Both Trotsky and the Mexican section of the Fourth International, the world organization Trotsky founded, had to disassociate themselves from Deigo at this point.This movie uses Kahlo's association with Trotsky to give a gloss to her and Rivera. Unlike the Mexican movie made about her entitled Freida (this is the name Kahlo was born with, not Frida), this film does not tell the view that in the late 1940s, Rivera and Kahlo became ultra-Stalinists.  They revived their friendship with David Alfred Siqueros who had attempted to murder Trotsky.  Frida Kahlo issued public statements denouncing herself for having had sex with Trotsky and pledged her eternal devotion to Stalin. Of course, this aspect of her life doesn't fit into the kind of marketable hagiagraphy that has less concern with the reality of a person and of politics than it does with a marketable image. It is true you do see a picture of Stalin on a canvas toward the end, but it is not clear to anyone who isn't already familiar with the story.I also was disappointed in the actor they had playing Diego. He played his part extremely well, but he was just not the right person for anyone to think to be Diego. The person was an English actor, apparently of Italian or Spanish origin.Diego was mostly if not entirely Indian, whereas Frida was actually half German Jewish.  Diego actually did the rough outlines and instructions of his murals and then got very indigenous Indians to paint in the colors with their rough brush strokes.This attempt to identify with the non-European art and culture and political identity of Mexico was a big part of what Diego and Frida were about, but it gets no play or reference in the movie. Frida adopted the regional dress of one of the most indigenous areas of Mexico,rather than follow the Europe-centered fashions of Mexico's intelligensia. Mexico is a nation where the the vast majority, the scores of millions of people of mixed and all Indian blood have traditionally struggled against an elite which emphasizes its ""Spanish"" ancestry.  Diego's proclamation of his Indianness and his sucess in Mexico as a mostly Indian cultural figure, and Frida's decision to identify with this was central to their lives and impact on their times.To me what is rather unfortunate is that while Kahlo's art was interesting and beautiful, and great in some ways, Diego is simply lost in all of this. He was one of the great artists of the 20th Century, far more significant than Kahlo in his impact on Mexican, Latin American, and world culture. Moreover, particularly for Mexicans and other Latin Americans, the cultural ideas about reclaiming the Indian identity and linking with the popular masses and the pre-Columbian cultures that he advanced were very important, not just for artists, but in political and literary circles as well. Diego played an important role fighting with his friend Andre Breton in charting an independent and radical artistic and intellectual response to Stalinist theory of ""socialist realist"" art.  Pathfinder Press has just come out with a brand new updated and better noted and glosseried edition of Breton's What is Surrealism which contains the declaration on Art and Artists in the 20th Century that Deigo, Trotsky, and Breton wrote together.Of course, all of Deigo's work dealt with the political struggle of Mexico and the world's working people to fight against imperialism and capitalism. This isn't very marketable among the upper middle class fadists at whom this film seems to aimed. They prefer a Frida and a Diego whose personal concerns about romance, sex, and personal fame are at the center of their lives, not two fighters for a socialist world!",5,"Visually interesting,

603049,A1K2ACRU9YJS17,B00005JLPK,"Tsila Sofer Elguez ""Tsila Sofer Elguez""","[0, 0]","I was not familiar with the story of Frida Kahlo and did not know anything about her or her husband Diego Rivera. After watching this colorful, passionate movie, I am sure I will not forget their story.My first impression from the movie is colors - Frida's face, her red lipstick, her hair with the cloth woven through her braids, the strong colors of her dresses, the flowers she likes and off course the colors Frida uses in her paintings.The colors are the rich strong colors of the Mexican culture, the houses, the greenery, and the women dresses.My second impression is the expressiveness and beauty of Selma Hayak. This actress, whom I never appreciated before, does the role of her life in this movie.  Some reviewers have commented that maybe Selma Hayak is too pretty for this role and their is a lot of truth in this comment but although Selma Hayak is no doubt beautiful she is still able to portray Frida as a very strong natured person with a unique personality, which is, so I feel, the essence and purpose of this movie.I can appreciate what the critical reviewers wrote about some shallowness and the fact that the story is presented in a Hollywood manner. However, I think that all this is acceptable in order to bring us the interesting story of Frida which did come across. We see her background, and are given means to understand the pain and feelings that are shown in her paintings. I felt that some of the stories in the movie were not totally clear to me - as a viewer I did not feel I totally understood the reasons for Rivera and thus Frida's attraction to the Marxist movement. Another unclear example would be Frida's tolerance to the fact her husbands ex wife and kids live above them. However, even these misunderstandings helps to create her image as an ""artist"" in my eyes.Bottom line: an interesting entertaining movie.",4,Beauty and Color,1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,1852,"['was', 'not', 'familiar', 'story', 'Frida', 'Kahlo', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'anything', 'husband', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'watching', 'colorful', 'passionate', 'movie', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'not', 'forget', 'story.My', 'first', 'impression', 'movie', 'colors', 'Frida', 'face', 'red', 'lipstick', 'hair', 'cloth', 'woven', 'braids', 'strong', 'colors', 'dresses', 'flowers', 'likes', 'course', 'colors', 'Frida', 'paintings.The', 'colors', 'are', 'rich', 'strong', 'colors', 'Mexican', 'culture', 'houses', 'greenery', 'women', 'dresses.My', 'second', 'impression', 'expressiveness', 'beauty', 'Selma', 'Hayak', 'actress', 'whom', 'never', 'appreciated', 'role', 'life', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'maybe', 'Selma', 'Hayak', 'too', 'pretty', 'role', 'lot', 'truth', 'comment', 'Selma', 'Hayak', 'doubt', 'still', 'able', 'portray', 'Frida', 'very', 'strong', 'natured', 'person', 'unique', 'personality', 'so', 'feel', 'essence', 'purpose', 'movie.I', 'can', 'appreciate', 'what', 'critical', 'reviewers', 'wrote', 'shallowness', 'fact', 'story', 'presented', 'Hollywood', 'manner', 'However', 'think', 'acceptable', 'order', 'bring', 'interesting', 'story', 'Frida', 'did', 'come', 'across', 'see', 'background', 'are', 'given', 'means', 'understand', 'pain', 'feelings', 'are', 'shown', 'paintings', 'felt', 'stories', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'totally', 'clear', 'viewer', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'totally', 'understood', 'reasons', 'Rivera', 'thus', 'Frida', 'attraction', 'Marxist', 'movement', 'unclear', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'Frida', 'tolerance', 'fact', 'husbands', 'ex', 'wife', 'kids', 'live', 'However', 'even', 'misunderstandings', 'helps', 'create', 'image', 'artist', 'eyes.Bottom', 'line', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'movie']",Frida

I hate that the audience is manipulated to feel that Frida, was a woman of passion! Who felt things deeply! Don't YOU feel it, viewer? Oh, the drama! Oh, I beat my breast as a sign of solidarity!! Of feeling!! Ohh ohhh ohh!!! Oh, Frida! You were such a passionate artist!! Ohhh!!! Your life was a celebration!! Oh!!! Your pain!! Your life!!!! WHAT RUBBISH!

603055,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B00005JLPK,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[35, 36]","I have seen Frida five times at the cinemas, and got the DVD as a gift. I must say that this is by far the most visually stunning, inspirational, and emotionally impacting film I have ever seen. Before this movie came out, I went the Vancouver Art Gallery to see some of Frida Kahlo's paintings and saw the documentary of her life. I was very fascinated by several of paintings, but I didn't get to see The Two Fridas or the paintinngs with the monkeys. I was moved to tears by the documentary of her life, and I instantly became a fan. I then bought the novel based on her life, and read it before the movie came out. I was dying to see the movie.This beautiful biopic is directed by the Julie Taymor, whose film Titus was an equally visual feast. It's a dream come true for the Oscar nominated Salma Hayek, who had spent more that seven years trying to get this movie made. It was a good thing that Madonna and Jennifer Lopez didn't get to do it, because they wouldn't be suitable to play Frida. Salma Hayek gave the performance of her career, and she actually hadn't done anything great before this movie, except for In The Times Of The Butterflies, which also costarred Mia Maestro who played her sister in both movies. Even though Salma lost the award to the overrated Nicole Kidman(The Hours), Frida still won two out of the six nominations. The music composed by Elliot Goldenthal trully capture the spirit of Frida and Mexico. Some of the songs are sung by Lila Downs, and Chavela Vargas. Burn It Blue heard at the end of the film is so beatiful. I even bought the soundtrack. Salma Hayek had more than fifty costumes here, designed by Julie Weiss on a shoestring budget. She made Hayek looked stunningly beautiful and striking, especially the photo shoot for the Paris Vogue cover, and the scene when she steps into her painting The Two Fridas.This movie chronicles the life and times of Frida and Diego Rivera(played by the underrated Alfred Molina), a womanizing fellow artist, mentor, and husband. Frida had endured a great deal of physical, emotional, and spiritual pain, and she survived, because she was strong and self-absorbing, and she transcend her life's most unforgetable moments onto the cavas in the form of surrealism that's autobiographical. From the bus accident that left her crippled for life to her stormy marriage to Rivera, to miscarriage, to international stardom, to heartaches of failed marriage and distant from her parents, to betrayed by her sister....and then there's the self-destructive behaviours(alcohol addiction and promiscuous sex with men and women). Life without Diego was meaningless to her at times. She intensionally had an affair with Leon Trotsky(a Russian Communist in exile played Geoffrey Rush) to provoke or repay Diego for his infidelity. She still loved him even when they were separated for a period of time, leaving her financially and physically devastated, that's when she painted her best work including The Two Fridas, which was one of the high points in the film. The reconcilation and remarriage of Frida and Diego was a heartfelt experience.The supporting cast are all superb. Alfred Molina was overlooked by the Oscar, he should've been nominated for best supporting actor, even though he doesn't look a whole lot like the actual Diego Rivera. I thought Valeria Golino was very good too. She played Diego's ex-wife, and she stole scene in this movie. Mia Maestro was great as Christina Kahlo, she was seduced by Diego to bed when she posed for his paintings. The affair broke Frida's heart. I also enjoyed Patricia Reyes Spindola's portrayal of Mrs. Kahlo. She was always negative about the choices Frida made in love and career. As for the big-star cameros which including Antonio Banderas(David Siqueiros), Ashley Judd(Tina Modotti), and Salma's ex-boyfriend Edward Norton(Nelson Rockefeller) who co-wrote the screenplay, I loved Judd's performance the most. Her sexy ""lesbian"" dance number with Salma Hayek was quite a treat.Salma Hayek gave a mesmerizing and multi-layered performance, and she was in every scene. She trully transformed herself in all aspects of character and showed the world that she's not just a bombshell, but a great actress to be taken seriously. I cried during several scenes including the scene when she got dumped by her first boyfriend(Alejandro/Diego Luna). I was also moved a great deal by the miscarriage, and the scene when she was devastated and started to cut her hair and got very drunk. The most powerful scene was when she was drinking and crying while listening to an old lady(Chavela Vargas) sang a ballad to her, and she went home and stepped into her painting(The Two Fridas).The music, cinematography, acting, art direction, editing, and direction all worked together to achieve a very memorable experience. The special features has some very good materials included, and I really enjoyed the interviews on Julie Taymor, Salma Hayek, and the singers and composers.I loved this movie and worship Frida. I admired her life's work as an artist, and her endurance of pain and struggles, and ultimately her relentless passion for love and creativity. I also collected the soundtrack, the Frida screenplay with photos of many of the scenes from the film, the postcard book, and a wall fabric drape painted with Frida and the Monkeys.This movie is definitely a must-see for artist, art lover, fashion lover, music and cultural fans, and of course all Salma Hayek fans too!",5,Salma Hayek's Dream Came True!,1113696000,"04 17,

Kahlo's determination was not a surpise, though. After the accident that shaped the rest of her life, that was the driving force that pulled the rest of the movie forward. It got her up and moving, in the most literal way. It was the only source of her skill as a artist - if she had any formal training, the movie glossed over it. It got Diego Rivera's attention (after an unfortunate, prior introduction). It even kept Rivera's attention, as much as it could be kept.A few surreal interludes punctuated the movie. A hospital scene, in particular, had an eerie, macabre look. That certainly captured the pained, drug-addled semiconsciousness that must have come and gone during recovery. It also involved imagery that was distinctly Mexican, suggesting the 'Day of the Dead' icons.Only a few points rang false in this movie. First, the body cast was too all-enveloping. Attending to sanitary needs would not have been possible for someone wrapped up that completely. Second, Kahlo's gait was remarkably strong and straight after the movie's first few scenes. I would have thought that Kahlo's defining accident would surely leave more than superficial scars.On the whole, this was a very enjoyable view of Kahlo as an artist, but mostly as a political activist. Looking just at her paintings, it's hard to remember just how many chances she took with her political involvements.  I suppose, though, that anyone so close to Rivera was already accustomed to a little danger and unpredictability.Hayek presented Kahlo as a physcially diminutive woman. I would like to believe that was an accurate portrayal. It just means that all of Kahlo's strength and energy was wound up even tighter, to fit in such a small package. On the whole, it was a very strong portrayal of a very strong woman.

If it were a book I'd be writing that I couldn't put it down.  The visual treat was just as delicious as the dialogue and the music, not to mention the historical aspect.  I was entranced by it all as the movie whisked me away to an earlier time in a place foreign yet familiar.The love story of Frida and Diego was masterly played by the two main characters.  Each was definitely the strength that inspired the other in their art.  My only critique of the movie was in having to hear the non-Spanish language cast attempt a Spanish accent when speaking English.  Short of using mostly all Spanish actors perhaps this was unavoidable.  The accents sounded okay until you heard those of Frida (played by Salma Hayek) or Antonio Banderas's character or any of the native Spanish speaking actors/actresses.  It was like tasting honey in your first cup of tea, then having someone add a sugar substitute like sweet and low in your second cup.  You still had a sweetness in your brew but the natural sweetener was noticeably missing.Frida Kahlo, a free thinking woman in love with a free loving man.

And hardly ever will the Twain meet. And that is a good thing.Frida is an amazing collage of one of the most fascinating artists, sexual and political women of our time. Like many others her paintings, at first repulsed me, but after reading excerpts from Herrera's biography on Frida- ( which is bogged down on the love letters and love making, with hardly a comment on the political and national turmoil of the times),- one could see why the painting's were so full of sorrow and life defying pain.Frida lived in some very volatile times the revolution in Russia with Trotsky living in her house. Her husband and mentor and much admired muralist Diego Rivera going to New York, commissioned to paint a mural for Rockefeller and painting Lenin as one of the struggling workers. When asked to remove Lenin from the painting, he refused and Rockefeller tore the mural down.It was a time of great nationalism and the struggle to stop the European influence in Mexico.Many kudos' to Salma Hayek for her devotion to this biopic. I was very concerned that it could not be done, but it has been done and a great job. There's got to be some Oscar nominations out of this beautiful movie. The vivid colors and the musical score are in themselves worth the trip to see this great movie. The two main characters, Salma and Molina fit as a pair of gloves and Tango around each other as honeybees around a bright red poppy.If you miss this movie you will have missed one of the best biopic's ever.ciao yaaah69I give it 4/5",4,"A TANGO OF LOVE, PAIN, AND SEXUAL REVOLUTION!",1036281600,"11 3, 2002",2002,1647,"['One', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'comparing', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'one', 'thing', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'art', 'forms', 'hardly', 'ever', 'will', 'Twain', 'meet', 'good', 'thing.Frida', 'amazing', 'collage', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'artists', 'sexual', 'political', 'women', 'time', 'many', 'others', 'paintings', 'first', 'repulsed', 'reading', 'excerpts', 'Herrera', 'biography', 'Frida-', 'bogged', 'down', 'love', 'letters', 'love', 'making', 'hardly', 'comment', 'political', 'national', 'turmoil', 'times', 'one', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'painting', 'were', 'so', 'full', 'sorrow', 'life', 'defying', 'pain.Frida', 'lived', 'very', 'volatile', 'times', 'revolution', 'Russia', 'Trotsky', 'living', 'house', 'husband', 'mentor', 'much', 'admired', 'muralist', 'Diego', 'Rivera', 'going', 'New', 'York', 'commissioned', 'paint', 'mural', 'Rockefeller', 'painting', 'Lenin', 'one', 'struggling', 'workers', 'When', 'asked', 'remove', 'Lenin', 'painting', 'refused', 'Rockefeller', 'tore', 'mural', 'down.It', 'was', 'time', 'great', 'nationalism', 'struggle', 'stop', 'European', 'influence', 'Mexico.Many', 'kudos', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'devotion', 'biopic', 'was', 'very', 'concerned', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'been', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'got', 'be', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'vivid', 'colors', 'musical', 'score', 'are', 'worth', 'trip', 'see', 'great', 'movie', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Salma', 'Molina', 'fit', 'pair', 'gloves', 'Tango', 'other', 'honeybees', 'bright', 'red', 'poppy.If', 'miss', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'missed', 'one', 'best', 'biopic', 'ever.ciao', 'yaaah69I', 'give', '4/5']",Frida
