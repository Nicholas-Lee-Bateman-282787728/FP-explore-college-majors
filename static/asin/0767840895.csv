This movie is a bit different than his other movies; the focuses on the romantic and comedy elements and downplays the trade-mark Jackie Chan fights.A village girl named ""Bu"" meets and falls in love with business executive CN Chan (Jackie Chan). The movie is about how Bu tries to capture CN's heart. Qi Shu played Bu and was wonderfully cute; how could you not fall in love with her! The dinner scene with Bu wearing a long blue dress was fun! Well, throw-in a mob-boss, some dumb henchmen and a few Jackie Chan fights and you have the movie. Specially entertaining was a fight scene with 4 silver aluminum baseball bats.Filmed in Hong Kong and English dubbed audio. The voices were pretty good; though knowing Jackie's voice so well, it is hard to hear some other voice from his mouth.

There's a couple of very well choreographed fight  sequences in the film, ( of the one against one variety) and a few moments of unnecessary sub-Three Stooges silliness slips in to another fight sequence which is a shadow of what Chan's given us in the past.The story is slight, and built upon the most ridiculous of coincidences as it strives to be a goofy likeable romantic comedy.Occassionally it succeeds.Don't get your hopes up for this one. You might find it difficult to get through the first 20 minutes or so, but if you can, Jackie fans will find the film a pleasant one.Jackie is after all getting older and will not be able to knock himself about as he has in the past.

For starters it's basically a romantic comedy with martial arts added.  The humor is pretty foreign to us westerners, but is pretty funny nonetheless (the boy who buys Bu an ""engagement oyster"" for example, and the scene with Bu in the fridge was pretty funny too).  But additionally its more than that.  It's also about the nature of rivalry, emnity, and eventual friendship between Chan and one of his business competitors.  The film manages to capture a certain depth of human nature which is unusual in the genre.The fight scenes fall into two categories.  The first are the classic Jackie Chan type fight scenes.  These include the boat scene, him taking on the four goons with baseball bats, and so forth.  The second are the scenes with the American street fighter which are of an altogether different variety and something I am not used to seeing in his movies.  Here we see some cross-over between western boxing and kung fu, beautifully choreographed, with plenty of surprises.  These scenes emphasize fair play, respect, and sportsmanship.The film is well worth watching, and is suitable for family viewing.Both Jackie Chan and Shu Qi play their roles very well.

The ever so beautiful Qu Shi plays as Bu who is following her heart by following a message that was found in a bottle in the ocean. She runs into Jackie and falls for him, but Jackie has always been a bachelor...will he fall for her? Watch and find out. This film is a great movie to watch with your lady...a love story for her, and great occasional action for the guys. Yes, this movie has fewer fight scenes that an ordinary Jackie movie, but it was enough. Not only that, but the fight scenes with white dude Brad Allen were totally awesome. The last fight is definitely up there somewhere in my top 20 and is worth the purchase alone. Since I am a sucker for a really good love story, I highly enjoyed the film, plus I really like Qu Shi and her very cute voice...The song for the movie is very catchy and theres even a video for it on the dvd. There is a lot of great comedy in here as well. Im grateful to say that Columbia released this film with its original language remastered, and to me thats very important. Plus, the dvd is relatively cheap which makes it well worth the purchase now. If you dont mind action movies with a love story, then by all means buy it. If you're a straight up martial arts buff, and just want to see a lot of good fighting, then at least rent it or something because the fight with Brad Allen is something to see (this guy can kick) and you just may buy it for that alone.

21934,A36H16ZJXUIMZG,0767840895,"Gene Cisco ""Moon Man""","[0, 0]","This family Chan film is a delightful, yet surprisingly romantic serving. Like Mr. Cruise in &#34;Collateral,&#34; (who handed the film to Jamie Foxx) Jackie Chan actually highlights the charms of Shu Qi showcasing her in a martial arts veneer. For admirers of Shu Qi this is a good thing. Little girl in the big city has been a staple Hollywood plot vehicle, but moving back and forth in sub-plots ends up weakening the romantic fable that anchors this movie. The stunts and fight sequences add comical rather than romantic weight to the main plot. However, I found it refreshing for Jackie (playing a self-absorbed tycoon) to be serious about his business and martial arts, especially seeing him train. And no one looked lovelier in white than Shu Qi. (the tennis world should pay attention) I would have welcomed more village girl-out-of-water scenes to further anchor the romantic pull of the leads, but perhaps they would have been mobbed too much in Hong Kong. Except for a couple too-brief close-ups to hint of a change of heart, the transition to angry lovers was too abrupt and not quite satisfying. As the mature businessman, Chan could have attempted to interest Bu (Shu Qi) in a younger suitor, but the only ones available were busy fighting Chan, which doesn't make sense to those of us who know there are places between a luxury condo and a small village. For me, the childhood fable does not develop fully because of the limited locales and perhaps deleted scenes of the two leads enjoying the sights (a la &#34;Roman Holiday&#34;) that would more naturally make the characters warm to one another. Ten more minutes of running time could have made this a top-rate romantic film like &#34;Pretty Woman&#34; but some producer considered the thought over budget. Although Shu Qi got equal cover space, she deserved more face time in the film to flesh out the fable. The director/writer of this film said nobody wanted to make this picture. I think he's wrong. When you have a goddess, and she's playing a fabled princess, you better get it right.

21935,A2HVL790PBWYTU,0767840895,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","GORGEOUS is a change of pace for Jackie Chan. Oh, this one still boasts your basically incredible martial arts sequences, but, really, this film marks Jackie Chan's foray into romantic comedy territory. And, despite that Jackie doesn't seem to have the acting range to pull off this type of leading man role, the other elements in this picture lift it into something I find quite entertaining.The plot revolves around a young starry-eyed village girl named Bu (Qi Shu), who finds a message in a bottle and flies to Hong Kong to meet the message's author. In Hong Kong Bu meets and falls for C.N. (Jackie Chan), a wealthy, lonely playboy businessman heading up a trash recycling empire. But as Bu and C.N. become close, their fledgling romance is interrupted by C.N.'s lifelong rival, who persists in sending his clumsy thugs after C.N.Whether you like GORGEOUS or not will hinge on how you feel about the lead actress, Qi Shu, as this film is as much a showcase for her as it is for Jackie Chan. My feeling on this is that Qi Shu wafts in like a breath of fresh air and is instantly captivating. There's an infectious exuberance about her, and a certain naturalness. I could watch her expressive face all day long. She definitely sets the mood of this film, which is mostly bright and whimsical and sweet. Wonderful actor Tony Leung also deserves his propers, as his gay fashion shutterbug provides a good share of the funnies (I couldn't help cracking up at his elevator scene with Jackie). In fact, some of the best moments happen when Leung and Qi Shu are playfully sharing the screen.Jackie Chan is never better than when he's performing his breathtaking stunts and acrobatics. Let's face it, dude's strength isn't in delivering lines. I'll say this, though, I've never seen Jackie so wistful and low-key than in this role, and he manages to tone down his usual mugging. Jackie has stated publicly that the character of C.N. is like him in many ways (both are clean-living, keep fit, like to wear white outfits, are environmentally aware). Sadly, though, this doesn't translate into an adept acting performance. As a romantic leading man, yeah, he's pretty wooden. Perhaps aware of this lack, Jackie makes sure that Qi Shu and Leung get plenty of camera time.Thankfully for Jackie, he does engage in several lighthearted scuffles (although not as many as we'd like). Jackie, as ever, is amazingly inventive and agile with his choreography. This time, he uses baseball bats, a boat, and a motorbike as supporting characters in his fight scenes. His opponent in two of these brawls is the tiny dynamo Bradley James Allan, who in real life happens to be the first ever non-Asian member of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. In GORGEOUS, he plays martial artist ""Allan,"" hired by C.N.'s rival to beat up C.N. and partly because his shorter stature would make C.N.'s defeat even more ignominious. As several persons have remarked, it's refreshing that Jackie and Allan's combat is marked with mutual respect and a spirit of competition. It reminds me a little ofReturn of the Dragon, of Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris's classic colosseum fight to the death. The only downside to Jackie and Allan's two otherwise excellent fights is that the camera was sped up in spots.Again, GORGEOUS isn't your typical Jackie Chan martial-arts action-comedy. It's more sedate in its pacing and, would you believe, more character driven. Some fans won't dig it, won't like the more contemplative Jackie Chan on screen and that it's not more action-oriented. But I like GORGEOUS a lot. Jackie Chan tried to change up his style, and, even if he wasn't completely successful, I'm still glad he had the guts to experiment and branch out. I say, check out this flick. You might even develop a craving for Chinese pot rice.",4,"""Don't just stand there wearing white!""",1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,3789,"['GORGEOUS', 'change', 'pace', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Oh', 'one', 'still', 'basically', 'incredible', 'martial', 'arts', 'sequences', 'really', 'film', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'foray', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'territory', 'Jackie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'acting', 'range', 'pull', 'off', 'type', 'leading', 'man', 'role', 'other', 'elements', 'picture', 'lift', 'something', 'find', 'quite', 'entertaining.The', 'plot', 'revolves', 'young', 'starry-eyed', 'village', 'girl', 'named', 'Bu', 'Qi', 'Shu', 'who', 'message', 'bottle', 'flies', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'meet', 'message', 'author', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Bu', 'meets', 'falls', 'C.N', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'wealthy', 'lonely', 'playboy', 'businessman', 'heading', 'up', 'trash', 'recycling', 'empire', 'Bu', 'C.N', 'become', 'close', 'fledgling', 'romance', 'interrupted', 'C.N', 'lifelong', 'rival', 'who', 'sending', 'clumsy', 'thugs', 'C.N.Whether', 'like', 'GORGEOUS', 'not', 'will', 'hinge', 'how', 'feel', 'lead', 'actress', 'Qi', 'Shu', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'showcase', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'feeling', 'Qi', 'Shu', 'wafts', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'instantly', 'captivating', 'infectious', 'exuberance', 'certain', 'naturalness', 'could', 'watch', 'expressive', 'face', 'day', 'long', 'definitely', 'mood', 'film', 'mostly', 'bright', 'whimsical', 'sweet', 'Wonderful', 'actor', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'also', 'propers', 'gay', 'fashion', 'shutterbug', 'good', 'share', 'funnies', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'cracking', 'up', 'elevator', 'scene', 'Jackie', 'fact', 'best', 'moments', 'happen', 'when', 'Leung', 'Qi', 'Shu', 'are', 'playfully', 'sharing', 'screen.Jackie', 'Chan', 'never', 'better', 'when', 'performing', 'breathtaking', 'stunts', 'acrobatics', 'Let', 'face', 'dude', 'strength', ""n't"", 'delivering', 'lines', ""'ll"", 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Jackie', 'so', 'wistful', 'low-key', 'role', 'tone', 'down', 'usual', 'mugging', 'Jackie', 'stated', 'publicly', 'character', 'C.N', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'clean-living', 'keep', 'fit', 'wear', 'white', 'outfits', 'are', 'environmentally', 'aware', 'Sadly', 'though', ""n't"", 'translate', 'adept', 'acting', 'performance', 'romantic', 'leading', 'man', 'yeah', 'pretty', 'wooden', 'Perhaps', 'aware', 'lack', 'Jackie', 'sure', 'Qi', 'Shu', 'Leung', 'get', 'plenty', 'camera', 'time.Thankfully', 'Jackie', 'engage', 'several', 'lighthearted', 'scuffles', 'not', 'as', 'many', ""'d"", 'like', 'Jackie', 'ever', 'amazingly', 'inventive', 'agile', 'choreography', 'time', 'baseball', 'bats', 'boat', 'motorbike', 'supporting', 'characters', 'fight', 'scenes', 'opponent', 'two', 'brawls', 'tiny', 'dynamo', 'Bradley', 'James', 'Allan', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'be', 'first', 'ever', 'non-Asian', 'member', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Stunt', 'Team', 'GORGEOUS', 'martial', 'artist', 'Allan', 'hired', 'C.N', 'rival', 'beat', 'up', 'C.N', 'partly', 'shorter', 'stature', 'would', 'make', 'C.N', 'defeat', 'even', 'more', 'ignominious', 'several', 'persons', 'have', 'remarked', 'refreshing', 'Jackie', 'Allan', 'combat', 'marked', 'mutual', 'respect', 'spirit', 'competition', 'little', 'ofReturn', 'Dragon', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'classic', 'colosseum', 'fight', 'death', 'only', 'downside', 'Jackie', 'Allan', 'two', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'fights', 'camera', 'was', 'sped', 'up', 'spots.Again', 'GORGEOUS', ""n't"", 'typical', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'martial-arts', 'action-comedy', 'more', 'sedate', 'pacing', 'would', 'believe', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dig', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'more', 'contemplative', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'screen', 'not', 'more', 'action-oriented', 'like', 'GORGEOUS', 'lot', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'tried', 'change', 'up', 'style', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'successful', ""'m"", 'still', 'glad', 'had', 'guts', 'experiment', 'branch', 'out', 'say', 'check', 'out', 'flick', 'might', 'even', 'develop', 'craving', 'Chinese', 'pot', 'rice']",N/A

21939,A1W16LV46EQQUQ,0767840895,Jean-Francois Virey,"[33, 34]","*Gorgeous* may well mark a turning point in Jackie Chan's career. Under  the guidance of his mentor, the late Leonard Ho, Chan had been confining  himself to playing cops and adventurers in action-packed martial arts  movies. But after Ho's death, he felt somewhat freer to explore new  horizons, and decided to take risks with this uncharacteristic romantic  comedy.*Gorgeous* is the story of a nave country-girl, Bu, interpreted  by the brilliant and extraordinarily charming Shu Qi (the tomboy from  Golden Harvest's video-gamish *Storm Riders*), who, after being lured to  the city by a message in a bottle, falls in love with an aloof, self-made  businessman, interpreted by Jackie Chan. The film also has a subplot  involving Chan's rivalry with a less principled businessman, whose hired  goons repeatedly attempt to beat Chan up.Seduced by the script written  by Vincent Kok, Chan infused the lead male character with his own  personality, down to his obsession with cleanliness, his fondness for white  clothes, his martial arts prowess and his name. The production designer  even copied Chan's real-life office and used Chan's training equipment for  the movie. (The only difference between his alter-ego and himself, Chan  says, is &quot;I don't understand Wall Street&quot;!)The result is a  mixture of fairy-tale, reminiscent at times of the Spielberg productions of  the eighties, romantic comedy, Hong Kong slapstick and martial arts movie-  a kind of Chinese Disney film, benevolent, healthy and moral. Even the  fight scenes are good-natured, preaching fair-play, non-violence, humility  and camaraderie.As Chan explains in his audio commentary, some critics  seem not to have found him believable as a businessman. But that is no  reflection on his acting abilities, which have improved a lot since the  1970s. On the contrary, I believe such remarks are motivated partly by the  same kind of tunnel-vision that is hampering the movie careers of the great  sitcom actors and actresses, and partly by the rarity of thoroughly good  businessmen on screen. As far as I am concerned, Chan can play any kind of  character (there's a Chinese architect in my script for *Spicemoon*;  hint-hint) and I think he could have scrapped the martial arts altogether  in *Gorgeous* and given us a full-fledged romantic comedy (even though we  would have lost the wonderful fighting scenes with his extremely talented  student, Brad Allan.)If you are tired of the depravity of most modern  movies, *Gorgeous* may be exactly the kind of alternative you are looking  for. I strongly suggest watching the film in Cantonese with subtitles, and  treating yourself to Chan's audio commentary (in English), a loose series  of reminiscences about the making of the film that will give you a glimpse  of Chan's wonderful generosity, candour and intelligence.",3,A charming family movie,969321600,"09 19, 2000",2000,2850,"['*Gorgeous*', 'may', 'well', 'mark', 'turning', 'point', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'career', 'guidance', 'mentor', 'late', 'Leonard', 'Ho', 'Chan', 'had', 'been', 'confining', 'playing', 'cops', 'adventurers', 'action-packed', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'Ho', 'death', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'freer', 'explore', 'new', 'horizons', 'decided', 'take', 'risks', 'uncharacteristic', 'romantic', 'comedy', '*Gorgeous*', 'story', 'nave', 'country-girl', 'Bu', 'interpreted', 'brilliant', 'extraordinarily', 'charming', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'tomboy', 'Golden', 'Harvest', 'video-gamish', '*Storm', 'Riders*', 'who', 'being', 'lured', 'city', 'message', 'bottle', 'love', 'aloof', 'self-made', 'businessman', 'interpreted', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'film', 'also', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Chan', 'rivalry', 'less', 'principled', 'businessman', 'hired', 'goons', 'repeatedly', 'attempt', 'beat', 'Chan', 'up.Seduced', 'script', 'written', 'Vincent', 'Kok', 'Chan', 'infused', 'lead', 'male', 'character', 'own', 'personality', 'down', 'obsession', 'cleanliness', 'fondness', 'white', 'clothes', 'martial', 'arts', 'prowess', 'name', 'production', 'designer', 'even', 'copied', 'Chan', 'real-life', 'office', 'used', 'Chan', 'training', 'equipment', 'movie', 'only', 'difference', 'alter-ego', 'Chan', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Wall', 'Street', 'quot', 'result', 'mixture', 'fairy-tale', 'reminiscent', 'times', 'Spielberg', 'productions', 'eighties', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'slapstick', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie-', 'kind', 'Chinese', 'Disney', 'film', 'benevolent', 'healthy', 'moral', 'Even', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'good-natured', 'preaching', 'fair-play', 'non-violence', 'humility', 'camaraderie.As', 'Chan', 'audio', 'commentary', 'critics', 'seem', 'not', 'have', 'found', 'believable', 'businessman', 'reflection', 'acting', 'abilities', 'have', 'improved', 'lot', '1970s', 'contrary', 'believe', 'such', 'remarks', 'are', 'motivated', 'partly', 'same', 'kind', 'tunnel-vision', 'hampering', 'movie', 'careers', 'great', 'sitcom', 'actors', 'actresses', 'partly', 'rarity', 'thoroughly', 'good', 'businessmen', 'screen', 'As', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'Chan', 'can', 'play', 'kind', 'character', 'Chinese', 'architect', 'script', '*Spicemoon*', 'hint-hint', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'scrapped', 'martial', 'arts', 'altogether', '*Gorgeous*', 'given', 'full-fledged', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'even', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'wonderful', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'extremely', 'talented', 'student', 'Brad', 'Allan', 'are', 'tired', 'depravity', 'most', 'modern', 'movies', '*Gorgeous*', 'may', 'be', 'exactly', 'kind', 'alternative', 'are', 'looking', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'watching', 'film', 'Cantonese', 'subtitles', 'treating', 'Chan', 'audio', 'commentary', 'English', 'loose', 'series', 'reminiscences', 'making', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'glimpse', 'Chan', 'wonderful', 'generosity', 'candour', 'intelligence']",N/A

I don't know what it is; girls are smarter than us in many respects, but many just don't know great movies when they see them, as they have yet to recognize Jackie Chan movies as great movies.  Well, for all those who agree with that statement or fall under that category, behold the remedy!This movie is really a chick flick, but it stars Jackie Chan, and has a few good fight scenes!  You might recognize Alan and Howie (the character names in this movie) from Mr. Nice Guy, which I think is cool!  It's a love story at heart, that plays out a lot like a modern fairy tale, just as sappy, until one moment near the end... (I'm not telling you any spoilers!)  It's also a hero story, and luckily, both sexes love hero stories!  Chan overcomes his enemies (there actually aren't any villains in the movie at all), and wins in the end, closing one of the better love stories I've seen, and that's without the action.So guys, if you love Jackie, but your girlfreinds/spouses don't really that much, you have to get this movie!

It was a lot of fun: filled with  action and romance, along with some surprisingly well-done production  design and art direction for a film like this.  No, the reason I'm giving  the whole package a whopping five stars is the &quot;full service&quot;  nature of the DVD.  Before the movie begins, we are given all KINDS of  choices.  We can watch the movie in standard format or widescreen.  We can  watch the dubbed English version or the original Cantonese release.  Heck,  we are then even asked if we want the subtitles turned on or off.  Finally,  the days of some studio executive deciding what the American public is  capable of handling when it comes to foreign action films are over.  No  more being FORCED to watch bad dubbing because it was decided for me that  &quot;Americans are unwilling to read subtitles&quot;.  Sitting back and  watching &quot;Gorgeous&quot;, it was terrific to finally get to hear the  actual voices of the actors we are seeing in a Jackie Chan movie (though I  have to add that I checked out the dubbed version, too, and it isn't as  horrendously bad as most other dubbing work I've come across).  The other  reason I'm going with the &quot;five star&quot; rating is the fact that the  extras on the DVD approach &quot;Criterion&quot; levels.  In addition to  the options mentioned above, viewers are also given a commentary track by  Mr. Chan (which I haven't watched yet but am looking forward to), a music  video, and several other background materials.  I guess I should conclude  with another comment about the movie itself: the DVD is worth the price  just for the two extended boxing/kick-boxing sequences between Jackie and  the guy his rival hires to beat up on him.  The ladies will probably think  those scenes have a &quot;tacked on&quot; quality and are gratuitous to the  story. The guys, however, will be on the edge of their seats.

If you can come to Jackie Chan with an open mind, not expecting the same ol', same ol', then you will be see something new. Gorgeous, even.The story revolves around an old legend of the reuniting, after their deaths, of man and woman in the deep as dolpins. The story passes on to the female lead, Shu Qi as Bu, whose name means dolphin, making her a living legend. When her dolphin friend Abu brings her a bottle with a message, she believes her destined love has sent for her. She leaves Taiwan for Hong Kong and (in that huge, giant city) finds the sender who is actually a handsome...gay man. They become fast friends.One thing leads to another and Bu saves C.N. Chan (Jackie Chan), who is a millionaire playboy. They are charmed by and with each other. A romance begins, not by today's standards when romance means meet, have sex, maybe get to know each other, then go separate ways. Their romance is truly charming and innocent, as in bygone days. When Jackie's character shows great respect and humility at the end, the viewer knows what the outcome is.Oh yes, the fight scenes. Apparently, martial arts fans come to this movie expecting more. The fight scenes also show restraint and respect and even laugh out loud humor. Frankly, I was reminded of the hilarious fight scenes of the first half of ""Ong-Bak: Thai Warrior."" How much slapstick humor could be incorporated into the sequences and for the fighting to show no blood or even breaks in skin? That is what the viewer gets here. The music behind the fighting is also different--a more playful sound, including Chinese drums.The best fights are between Jackie and an American, both respectful and considerate of each other. This type of fighting was pleasant to watch--seeing great talent and control to best each other without that wretched drive to kill and destroy. One reviewer indicated the use of wires and speeding the recording of the fighting. Is that done here?Even though I really enjoyed this film, I must state what I saw as a shortcoming. Jackie and his supposed school-time buddy are nowhere near the same age.  Shu Qi is much too young to play his love interest. I was a bit embarrassed for him. Is Jackie, like the rest of us, having a hard time dealing with his age?Even so, the film has its gorgeous points: Bu's purity and self-confidence, the honesty of the fights, Jackie's change of heart, the wardrobes of the gay men, and, of course, the beauty of the dolphins and the legend surrounding them.",4,Getting to Gorgeous,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,2512,"['What', 'delightful', '99', 'minutes', 'can', 'come', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'open', 'mind', 'not', 'expecting', 'same', 'ol', 'same', 'ol', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'see', 'something', 'new', 'Gorgeous', 'even.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'old', 'legend', 'reuniting', 'deaths', 'man', 'woman', 'deep', 'dolpins', 'story', 'female', 'lead', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'Bu', 'name', 'dolphin', 'making', 'living', 'legend', 'When', 'dolphin', 'friend', 'Abu', 'bottle', 'message', 'destined', 'love', 'sent', 'Taiwan', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'huge', 'giant', 'city', 'sender', 'who', 'actually', 'handsome', 'gay', 'man', 'become', 'fast', 'friends.One', 'thing', 'Bu', 'C.N', 'Chan', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'who', 'millionaire', 'playboy', 'are', 'charmed', 'other', 'romance', 'not', 'today', 'standards', 'when', 'romance', 'meet', 'have', 'sex', 'maybe', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'then', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'romance', 'truly', 'charming', 'innocent', 'bygone', 'days', 'When', 'Jackie', 'character', 'great', 'respect', 'humility', 'end', 'viewer', 'what', 'outcome', 'is.Oh', 'yes', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Apparently', 'martial', 'arts', 'fans', 'come', 'movie', 'expecting', 'more', 'fight', 'scenes', 'also', 'show', 'restraint', 'respect', 'even', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'humor', 'Frankly', 'was', 'reminded', 'hilarious', 'fight', 'scenes', 'first', 'half', 'Ong-Bak', 'Thai', 'Warrior', 'How', 'much', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'could', 'be', 'incorporated', 'sequences', 'fighting', 'show', 'blood', 'even', 'breaks', 'skin', 'what', 'viewer', 'here', 'music', 'fighting', 'also', 'different', 'more', 'playful', 'sound', 'including', 'Chinese', 'drums.The', 'best', 'fights', 'are', 'Jackie', 'American', 'respectful', 'considerate', 'other', 'type', 'fighting', 'was', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'seeing', 'great', 'talent', 'control', 'best', 'other', 'wretched', 'drive', 'kill', 'destroy', 'One', 'reviewer', 'indicated', 'use', 'wires', 'speeding', 'recording', 'fighting', 'done', 'here', 'Even', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'must', 'state', 'what', 'saw', 'shortcoming', 'Jackie', 'supposed', 'school-time', 'buddy', 'are', 'nowhere', 'same', 'age', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'play', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'bit', 'embarrassed', 'Jackie', 'rest', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'dealing', 'age', 'Even', 'so', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'points', 'Bu', 'purity', 'self-confidence', 'honesty', 'fights', 'Jackie', 'change', 'heart', 'wardrobes', 'gay', 'men', 'course', 'beauty', 'dolphins', 'legend', 'surrounding']",N/A

You can skip the first 30 minutes nothing really happens. That girl C.N. likes in the movie is annoying. The fight scene with the bats is awesome. He takes 4 bats from 4 people. Some people would have got one or two but C.N. got all of them.I like the fight scene with that small guy named Alen that was hired by C.N.'s best friend to defeat him. Well his friend didn't want him killed but he knew C.N. was going to get defeated and he wanted to show him that he has to get back into training instead of buying stocks all the time. There is really no enemies in this movie. Nobody really tries to kill anyone. There are no guns, blood, or knives in this movie. When C.N. and Alen fight they use boxing gloves. When Alen first beats C.N. he asks him if he's okay. There is no bad language. This movie could've been rated PG.The second fight between Alen and C.N. is really cool.

I waited two years to check out this film, and it was worth the wait. Jackie plays a different kind of character from his other movies. And the plot is also focused around a romantic plot as well. Shu Qi, who plays Bu, is a charming distraction to Jackie's character of C.N. Chan. She's loveable, and believes that everything has a happy ending. How can you not like her? Even her opening monologue sounds like something out of a fairy tale. Don't expect any death-defying stunts in this one. But on the plus side, it has some dynamite fight scenes in which Jackie makes memorable use of a jacket and some baseball bats. The downside of Gorgeous is in the dubbing. Jackie and much of the original cast didn't provide their own voices. I think it's the fact that Jackie didn't have plans to release this in this U.S. because he thought it was too Asian for an American audience. But some American film distributors wanted it anyway, and used their own voice talent for the film (the guy that did Jackie's voice didn't even sound like Jackie). The dubbing, though, is only a minor distraction from the enjoyment of this film. There are plenty of one-liners to make up for that. Give this one a look.

21957,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,0767840895,Simon,"[4, 4]","Gorgeous is a modern fairy-tale that blends traditional romance-comedy themes with Jackie Chan's trademark sense of action. A teenage country girl finds a romantic message in a bottle and travels to Hong Kong to find its sender. Though that doesn't exactly work out like planned, she does meet Chan's character, a millionarie industrialist. As the two get to know each other, a business rival plots to humiliate Chan by pitting him against an American fighter.This love story works quite well, thanks to the strengths of its leads. Shu Qi's cuteness, spunky personality and exaggerated facial expressions set the movie's tone, while it's nice to see the always-loveable Jackie Chan play a different role (though really, Jackie Chan plays Jackie Chan in all the movies he does). It's not a revolutionary plot, and a few scenes could have been better executed (the obligatory 'break-up' before the happy ending is rather weak), but on the whole the mushy side of me ate it up. Jackie Chan does romance quite well.There are also some fight sequences sprinkled here and there; two are classic Jackie Chan where he uses the environment against his opponents, and the other two are showcase-quality fights against Bradley James Allan, a member of Jackie's own stunt team. These fights, well-executed that they are, feel tacked-on to the movie. It's like someone was afraid fans wouldn't respond well to a Jackie Chan movie without fights, and so contrived a few for the heck of it. In keeping with the movie's lighthearted tone, the bad guys arent really evil, and the fights are either cartoonish or done in a manner where the combatants show respect to each other. It's a nice variation.Gorgeous really won me over. The dvd loses a star for not including the uncut version, though it includes a Jackie Chan commentary that the Hong Kong version doesn't. Great date movie that has something for guys and girls, and worth seeing for anyone curious about a 'Jackie Chan romance'.",4,"Charming, romantic, fun",1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,1972,"['Gorgeous', 'modern', 'fairy-tale', 'traditional', 'romance-comedy', 'themes', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'trademark', 'sense', 'action', 'teenage', 'country', 'girl', 'romantic', 'message', 'bottle', 'travels', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'find', 'sender', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'work', 'out', 'planned', 'meet', 'Chan', 'character', 'millionarie', 'industrialist', 'two', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'business', 'rival', 'plots', 'humiliate', 'Chan', 'pitting', 'American', 'fighter.This', 'love', 'story', 'quite', 'well', 'thanks', 'strengths', 'leads', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'cuteness', 'spunky', 'personality', 'exaggerated', 'facial', 'expressions', 'set', 'movie', 'tone', 'nice', 'see', 'always-loveable', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'play', 'different', 'role', 'really', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movies', 'not', 'revolutionary', 'plot', 'few', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'executed', 'obligatory', ""'break-up"", 'happy', 'ending', 'rather', 'weak', 'whole', 'mushy', 'side', 'ate', 'up', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'romance', 'quite', 'are', 'also', 'fight', 'sequences', 'sprinkled', 'here', 'there', 'two', 'are', 'classic', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'where', 'environment', 'opponents', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'showcase-quality', 'fights', 'Bradley', 'James', 'Allan', 'member', 'Jackie', 'own', 'stunt', 'team', 'fights', 'well-executed', 'are', 'feel', 'tacked-on', 'movie', 'someone', 'was', 'afraid', 'fans', 'would', ""n't"", 'respond', 'well', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie', 'fights', 'so', 'contrived', 'few', 'heck', 'keeping', 'movie', 'lighthearted', 'tone', 'bad', 'guys', 'arent', 'really', 'evil', 'fights', 'are', 'cartoonish', 'done', 'manner', 'where', 'combatants', 'show', 'respect', 'other', 'nice', 'variation.Gorgeous', 'really', 'won', 'dvd', 'star', 'not', 'including', 'uncut', 'version', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'commentary', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'version', ""n't"", 'Great', 'date', 'movie', 'something', 'guys', 'girls', 'worth', 'seeing', 'anyone', 'curious', ""'Jackie"", 'Chan', 'romance']",N/A

I have to say that, even though I have my own copy of this movie and have watched it and enjoyed it several times, I am never able to suspend my disbelief.  I am always bothered by the disparity in the ages of Jackie Chan and his leading teenager!  I will be glad when Jackie Chan stops playing 20-somethings and moves entirely into his true age group with roles that allow him to show off his acting range (which is actually quite impressive.)  The man is a good actor, and he can sing!

Not only was this diff voice just plain redicolous and SO NOT  jackie. I immedietly jumped out of my seat because Jackie dubbs  ALL his  new films. The dubbing of Jackie and the Girl are prob the only bad things  about this film. But they are pretty bad.On the UPside, it was nice to  see that jackie both wrote and produced this little number. Its certainly  non-typical Jackie, which is good for a change. THere is no straight up  &quot;Villian&quot; and the two &quot;one on one&quot; fight scenes show  that Jackie Still hasn't lost his knack to do killer moves. There aren't  any real stunts in the movie. And only two real big fight scenes with this  awesome martial artist that Jackie Fights against. I wish I knew his name,  but George Lucas should prob add him to Episode II. (Could be the Next Ray  Park)The Love Story is a bit hokey at times, and the girl seems like a  real bubble head. Jackie does well as the lonely millionare, and the  progression of it is at least is believable. I've never seen a chinese-love  story and they do add a bit of Magical elements to the story which gives  the movie an odd feeling, but a fanciful one. It does have some good funny  moments too. I rented it, but being a HardCore Jackie fan I will put off  buying this just because it doesn't have alot of replay value.  I'm still  waiting for the Collectors DVD Edition of Drunken Master 2.overall,  good Jackie Film with a nice mixture of Love for the gals and Action for  the guys.
