Meanwhile, the Enterprise is thrown almost a thousand light years away by the planet's hidden defense system.More landing party members are attacked by Losira, until it is discovered that she can only attack the party member that she calls by name.  The remaining party then keep her from attacking the named crewmember.  Meanwhile, Scotty repairs some sabotage to the engines that Losira had accomplished before throwing the Enterprise out of orbit, and then hurries back to Losira's world.Kirk discovers a hidden room with a highly advanced computer, and the defense mechanism there creates three Losiras - which keep them from protecting each other as they had previously.  The cavalry, in the form of Spock and a landing party, arrive just in time to deactivate the computer.The previously taped message reveals that the planet had been artificially enhanced by colonists, who were affected by a disease that killed them all off.  The disease then followed the colonists back to their homeworld, supposedly wiping out the entire civilization.  Nothing but the computer program, which defends the planet from anyone who is not of Losira's race, remains.  The colonist's relief ship never arrived.Kirk says beauty survives, because the computer continues to project an image of Losira even after delivering the message about the colonist's destruction.My score - 5 out of a possible 10.",3,Beauty survives?,1029542400,"08 17, 2002",2002,1679,"['69th', 'episode', 'classic', 'Trek', 'Kirk', 'crew', 'are', 'exploring', 'ruins', 'found', 'class-M', 'planet', 'have', 'developed', 'livable', 'climate', 'only', 'few', 'thousand', 'years.The', 'Enterprise', 'landing', 'party', 'attacked', 'Losira', 'woman', 'who', 'crewman', 'just', 'touch', 'hand', 'Meanwhile', 'Enterprise', 'thrown', 'almost', 'thousand', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'planet', 'hidden', 'defense', 'system.More', 'landing', 'party', 'members', 'are', 'attacked', 'Losira', 'discovered', 'can', 'only', 'attack', 'party', 'member', 'name', 'remaining', 'party', 'then', 'keep', 'attacking', 'named', 'crewmember', 'Meanwhile', 'Scotty', 'sabotage', 'engines', 'Losira', 'had', 'accomplished', 'throwing', 'Enterprise', 'orbit', 'then', 'hurries', 'back', 'Losira', 'world.Kirk', 'hidden', 'room', 'highly', 'advanced', 'computer', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'there', 'three', 'Losiras', 'keep', 'protecting', 'other', 'had', 'previously', 'cavalry', 'form', 'Spock', 'landing', 'party', 'arrive', 'just', 'time', 'deactivate', 'computer.The', 'previously', 'taped', 'message', 'reveals', 'planet', 'had', 'been', 'artificially', 'enhanced', 'colonists', 'who', 'were', 'affected', 'disease', 'killed', 'off', 'disease', 'then', 'followed', 'colonists', 'back', 'homeworld', 'supposedly', 'wiping', 'out', 'entire', 'civilization', 'Nothing', 'computer', 'program', 'planet', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'Losira', 'race', 'colonist', 'relief', 'ship', 'never', 'arrived.Kirk', 'beauty', 'survives', 'computer', 'project', 'image', 'Losira', 'even', 'delivering', 'message', 'colonist', 'destruction.My', 'score', '5', 'possible', '10']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 69: That Which Survives VHS"

The Enterprise is suddenly flung nearly a thousand light years distant, leaving the landing party stranded. The woman appears again on the surface of the planet and when she touches D' Amato, he dies due to massive cellular disruption.When the woman reappears, Zulu tries to fight her off but his phaser fails to work. A slight touch causes disruption in his shoulder, yet nothing happens when she touches Kirk. They learn very quickly that she is programmed to kill only a certain person and her touch is harmless to everyone else. By asking her who she is for, the others can use their bodies to shield the intended victim.Scotty is once again the miracle man as he regains control of the Enterprise and it speeds back to rescue the captain and his landing party. Kirk learns that all of the people on the planet have died and the defense computer is using the image of the last one alive to create the killing entities. The Enterprise gets back in the nick of time and destroys the computer, saving Kirk and his party. This time, the computer is unaware of the presence of the Enterprise.This episode is another one of the lackluster and forgettable stories of the last season. Once again, they encounter a force so powerful that it can send the Enterprise a thousand light years away, understands how to selectively destroy the cells of a unique individual, yet, this force can be easily fooled and defeated. Once Kirk understands what it is doing, they can stop it. It would have been a much more effective defense if the computer had just disrupted the cells of all people in the landing party simultaneously.",3,"Once again, the Enteprise crew encounters a powerful force that is easily fooled and defeated",1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,1811,"['When', 'Enterprise', 'investigating', 'anomalous', 'planet', 'woman', 'suddenly', 'transporter', 'room', 'when', 'Kirk', 'landing', 'party', 'are', 'beaming', 'down', 'renders', 'touch', 'lethal', 'operator', 'Enterprise', 'suddenly', 'flung', 'nearly', 'thousand', 'light', 'years', 'distant', 'leaving', 'landing', 'party', 'stranded', 'woman', 'again', 'surface', 'planet', 'when', 'D', 'Amato', 'due', 'massive', 'cellular', 'disruption.When', 'woman', 'Zulu', 'fight', 'off', 'phaser', 'work', 'slight', 'touch', 'causes', 'disruption', 'shoulder', 'yet', 'nothing', 'happens', 'when', 'Kirk', 'learn', 'very', 'quickly', 'programmed', 'kill', 'only', 'certain', 'person', 'touch', 'harmless', 'everyone', 'else', 'asking', 'who', 'others', 'can', 'use', 'bodies', 'shield', 'intended', 'victim.Scotty', 'once', 'again', 'miracle', 'man', 'control', 'Enterprise', 'back', 'rescue', 'captain', 'landing', 'party', 'Kirk', 'people', 'planet', 'have', 'died', 'defense', 'computer', 'using', 'image', 'last', 'one', 'alive', 'create', 'killing', 'entities', 'Enterprise', 'back', 'nick', 'time', 'computer', 'saving', 'Kirk', 'party', 'time', 'computer', 'unaware', 'presence', 'Enterprise.This', 'episode', 'one', 'lackluster', 'forgettable', 'stories', 'last', 'season', 'Once', 'again', 'encounter', 'force', 'so', 'powerful', 'can', 'send', 'Enterprise', 'thousand', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'how', 'selectively', 'destroy', 'cells', 'unique', 'individual', 'yet', 'force', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'fooled', 'defeated', 'Once', 'Kirk', 'what', 'doing', 'can', 'stop', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'defense', 'computer', 'had', 'just', 'disrupted', 'cells', 'people', 'landing', 'party', 'simultaneously']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 69: That Which Survives VHS"

She touches an ensign and kills him. Already dematerializing in the transporter beam, Kirk and the  rest of his party are helpless to stop her. Losira disappears.  The surge  of power that Losira's appearance caused hurtles the Enterprise 990.7 light  years away from where they were. Spock calculates that it will take 11.33  hours at warp 8.4 to return to the planet.  On the surface of the planet,  Kirk, McCoy, Sulu and geologist D'Amato discover the vegetation is  poisonous to humans and the rocks are made of an alloy that did not develop  naturally. Losira appears again and kills D'Amato, again, by merely  touching him. She vanishes, then reappears, this time for Sulu, but he  avoids her and they realize she can only harm the person whose name she  calls.  Kirk, Sulu and McCoy band together to keep her from killing them.  Losira reappears on the Enterprise, in engineering, and kills another  crewman. When Scotty insists that something &quot;feels&quot; wrong with  the ship, they discover that Losira had sabotaged the matter/antimatter  integrator. Scotty repairs the device before it has a chance to explode.  On the planet's surface, the landing party finds a chamber in the rocks  that houses a computer. They realize that this is where Losira appears  from. Losira appears to them again, this time in threes, so that she can  touch each officer at once.  Spock and a security team arrive and destroy  the computer what was projecting Losira's image. A visual recording  triggered by the computer shows that the planet was once an outpost of the  Kalandan race. It was ravaged by a deadly organism which supply ships  unknowingly carried back to their home world. With the computer destroyed,  the last of the Kalandans' is also dead.",3,This episode gets a C+ grade and is ranked 44th out of 80,943315200,"11 23, 1999",1999,1874,"['landing', 'party', 'prepares', 'beam', 'down', 'previously', 'unexplored', 'Class', 'M', 'planet', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Losira', 'ensign', 'Already', 'dematerializing', 'transporter', 'beam', 'Kirk', 'rest', 'party', 'are', 'helpless', 'stop', 'Losira', 'disappears', 'surge', 'power', 'Losira', 'appearance', 'caused', 'Enterprise', '990.7', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'where', 'were', 'Spock', 'will', 'take', '11.33', 'hours', '8.4', 'return', 'planet', 'surface', 'planet', 'Kirk', 'McCoy', 'Sulu', 'geologist', ""D'Amato"", 'vegetation', 'poisonous', 'humans', 'rocks', 'are', 'made', 'alloy', 'did', 'not', 'develop', 'naturally', 'Losira', 'again', 'kills', ""D'Amato"", 'again', 'merely', 'touching', 'then', 'time', 'Sulu', 'realize', 'can', 'only', 'harm', 'person', 'name', 'Kirk', 'Sulu', 'McCoy', 'band', 'together', 'keep', 'killing', 'Losira', 'Enterprise', 'engineering', 'crewman', 'When', 'Scotty', 'insists', 'something', 'quot', 'feels', 'quot', 'wrong', 'ship', 'discover', 'Losira', 'had', 'sabotaged', 'matter/antimatter', 'integrator', 'Scotty', 'device', 'chance', 'explode', 'planet', 'surface', 'landing', 'party', 'chamber', 'rocks', 'houses', 'computer', 'realize', 'where', 'Losira', 'Losira', 'again', 'time', 'threes', 'can', 'touch', 'officer', 'once', 'Spock', 'security', 'team', 'arrive', 'destroy', 'computer', 'what', 'was', 'projecting', 'Losira', 'image', 'visual', 'recording', 'triggered', 'computer', 'planet', 'was', 'once', 'outpost', 'Kalandan', 'race', 'was', 'ravaged', 'deadly', 'organism', 'supply', 'ships', 'unknowingly', 'carried', 'back', 'home', 'world', 'computer', 'destroyed', 'last', 'Kalandans', 'also', 'dead']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 69: That Which Survives VHS"
