When the 1985-86 season,the fourth for Cheers,began Woody Harrelson joined the cast primarily to replace Colasanto. Harrelson is Woody Boyd who was undoubtedly much younger and more physically active than Coach. Other than Harrelson's inauguration into the cast,there were no changes amongst the other characters or their actions. Sam Malone(Ted Danson) and Diane Chambers(Shelley Long) are a couple again only to end up breaking up again. Carla Tortelli(Rhea Perlman) is still acid-tongued and often bitchy. Latecomer Dr. Frasier Crane(Kelsey Grammer) is welcomed back. Frasier was a hit character during 1984-85. Norm Peterson(George Wendt) is still chug-a-lugging. Cliff Claven(John Ratzenberger) is still delivering mail. Very often,either Cheers or The Cosby Show,another NBC sitcom also seen on Thursday nights,would take the #1 position in the Nielsen ratings.

The shows centers itself around the friendly neighborhood Boston bar named Cheers. The bar is owned by former Boston Red Sox relief pitcher Sam Malone (Ted Danson). Sam has three employees - bartender Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson) and waitresses Carla Tortelli (Rhea Pearlman) and Diane Chambers (Shelley Long). Noted psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammar) is a regular at the bar (and would later star in his own series spin-off, Frasier). Regular barflies Norm Peterson (George Wendt) and Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) round out a strong supporting cast.The Cheers (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes, including the first episode of the season which features the gang at Cheers and their remembrance of the late Ernie Pantusso (Coach). In this first episode, Indiana farm boy Woody Boyd arrives to meet his pen-pal (who happens to be Coach), but upon learning of Coach's death, Woody is hired by Sam to be a bartender. We also learn in the initial episode that Diane left Frasier at the altar during the couple's trek across Europe. The season ends with an improbable romance between Sam and the beautiful and intelligent city councilwoman Janet Eldridge (Kate Mulgrew). Diane is insanely jealous of Sam and Janet's romance, and the season ends with Sam's over-the-phone marriage proposal to a mysterious woman...Below is a list of episodes included on the Cheers (Season 4) DVD:Episode 70 (Birth, Death, Love and Rice)Episode 71 (Woody Goes Belly Up)Episode 72 (Someday My Prince Will Come)Episode 73 (The Groom Wore Clearasil)Episode 74 (Diane's Nightmare)Episode 75 (I Will Gladly Pay You Tuesday)Episode 76 (2 Good 2 Be 4 Real)Episode 77 (Love Thy Neighbor)Episode 78 (From Beer to Eternity)Episode 79 (The Barstoolie)Episode 80 (Don Juan is Hell)Episode 81 (Fools and Their Money)Episode 82 (Take My Shirt, Please)Episode 83 (Suspicion)Episode 84 (The Triangle)Episode 85 (Cliffie's Big Score)Episode 86 (Second Time Around)Episode 87 (The Peterson Principle)Episode 88 (Dark Imaginings)Episode 89 (Save the Last Dance For Me)Episode 90 (Fear is My Co-Pilot)Episode 91 (Diane Chambers Day)Episode 92 (Relief Bartender)Episode 93 (Strange Bedfellows: Part 1)Episode 94 (Strange Bedfellows: Part 2)Episode 95 (Strange Bedfellows: Part 3)The DVD Report",5,One of the greatest sitcoms in television history!,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2448,"['One', 'greatest', 'television', 'comedies', 'history', 'Cheers', 'absolute', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'regular', 'hangout', 'where', 'everybody', 'name', 'shows', 'centers', 'friendly', 'neighborhood', 'Boston', 'bar', 'named', 'Cheers', 'bar', 'owned', 'former', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'relief', 'pitcher', 'Sam', 'Malone', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Sam', 'three', 'employees', 'bartender', 'Woody', 'Boyd', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Carla', 'Tortelli', 'Rhea', 'Pearlman', 'Diane', 'Chambers', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'Noted', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'regular', 'bar', 'would', 'later', 'star', 'own', 'series', 'spin-off', 'Frasier', 'Regular', 'barflies', 'Norm', 'Peterson', 'George', 'Wendt', 'Cliff', 'Clavin', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'round', 'out', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast.The', 'Cheers', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'gang', 'Cheers', 'remembrance', 'late', 'Ernie', 'Pantusso', 'Coach', 'first', 'episode', 'Indiana', 'farm', 'boy', 'Woody', 'Boyd', 'meet', 'pen-pal', 'who', 'be', 'Coach', 'learning', 'Coach', 'death', 'Woody', 'hired', 'Sam', 'be', 'bartender', 'also', 'learn', 'initial', 'episode', 'Diane', 'left', 'Frasier', 'altar', 'couple', 'trek', 'Europe', 'season', 'improbable', 'romance', 'Sam', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'city', 'councilwoman', 'Janet', 'Eldridge', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'Diane', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'Sam', 'Janet', 'romance', 'season', 'Sam', 'over-the-phone', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Cheers', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'Episode', '70', 'Birth', 'Death', 'Love', 'Rice', 'Episode', '71', 'Woody', 'Goes', 'Belly', 'Up', 'Episode', '72', 'Someday', 'My', 'Prince', 'Will', 'Come', 'Episode', '73', 'Groom', 'Wore', 'Clearasil', 'Episode', '74', 'Diane', 'Nightmare', 'Episode', '75', 'Will', 'Gladly', 'Pay', 'Tuesday', 'Episode', '76', '2', 'Good', '2', 'Be', '4', 'Real', 'Episode', '77', 'Love', 'Thy', 'Neighbor', 'Episode', '78', 'From', 'Beer', 'Eternity', 'Episode', '79', 'Barstoolie', 'Episode', '80', 'Don', 'Juan', 'Hell', 'Episode', '81', 'Fools', 'Their', 'Money', 'Episode', '82', 'Take', 'My', 'Shirt', 'Please', 'Episode', '83', 'Suspicion', 'Episode', '84', 'Triangle', 'Episode', '85', 'Cliffie', 'Big', 'Score', 'Episode', '86', 'Second', 'Time', 'Around', 'Episode', '87', 'Peterson', 'Principle', 'Episode', '88', 'Dark', 'Imaginings', 'Episode', '89', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'Me', 'Episode', '90', 'Fear', 'My', 'Co-Pilot', 'Episode', '91', 'Diane', 'Chambers', 'Day', 'Episode', '92', 'Relief', 'Bartender', 'Episode', '93', 'Strange', 'Bedfellows', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '94', 'Strange', 'Bedfellows', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '95', 'Strange', 'Bedfellows', 'Part', '3', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

A lot of classic moments, including The Cheers gangs first mix up with Gary's Old Towne Tavern, at the bowling alley,and the classic three episode season ender when Sammy is dating the politician women Janet Eldridge, and at he end askes Diane to marry him.

Cheers is still classic, and I don't need extras. The episodes are enough. I certaintly won't give it less stars just because of no extras. The episodes themselves merit the 5 star rating.

I thought the show was good with Coach Ernie but really took off and hit its stride with the addition of Woody Boyd.  Such a different character than Coach and did the writers ever use the dumb farm boy from Indiana to their advantage!  This set introduces us to Woody and also Frazier Crane become a true regular member of the cast on season 4.  There are no extras on this collection, just the episodes but that is all that I was really looking for anyway.  I passed on seasons 1 through 3 but had to pick this and season 5 up together and I am glad I did.  If you were a Cheers regular, this season and season 5 really have Sam and Diane playing a great game with each other, much better than Ross and Rachel tried a decade later.  This and season 5 are the last to feature Shelley Long and once she left the show, a lot of the shows became hit or miss with Rebecca Howe slowly losing the plot.  Buy this if you like classic comedy. Buy this if you like to laugh.  Buy this if you miss this show!

869813,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B0006IUDYY,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[4, 7]","The fourth season of Cheers marked the beginning of a new era in the Boston bar, as Indiana boy Woody Boyd came to town and forever changed the face of the establishment.Replacing a beloved, and hilarious, character like Coach was no easy task. Nicholas Colasanto brought the guy to life, but with his passing near the end of the third season, someone was needed to take his place behind the bar and Woody was perfect.Boyd, portrayed by Woody Harrelson, didn't try to be Coach, he just tried to fill in where Coach had been with his own brand of humor. His naivete and his simple mind were much like Coach's which led to some great situations throughout the season and for many years to come.Of course central to the Cheers story in those early years was the relationship between Sam and Diane. Ted Danson and Shelley Long had some great chemistry, something that I was never able to witness in the days, as when these first seasons aired, I was too young to be watching. The Cheers I remember had Kirstie Alley, but the chemistry with the two original stars was a far superior brand and made for some incredibly awkward, yet very funny scenes.The season begins with Sam returning from Europe where he went to try and stop Diane from marrying Frasier (recurring star Kelsey Grammer). Throughout the year, the two hint at what they seem to be heading for with each other, but every time they seem destined to be together, they fall apart. The season ended with Sam and a city councilwoman in a serious relationship and Diane torn up about it, as she obviously still has feelings for Sam and vice versa.Adding to the atmosphere at Cheers, in addition to Woody, is waitress Carla Tortelli, whose wise-cracks are almost always directed toward Diane or Cliff, the mama's boy mailman who is always trying to impress the gang with some obscure knowledge, or even potatoes that look like Richard Nixon. Carla's view of the world is obviously tinted by the fact that she has a rather large number of kids at home and no husband. Her ex, Nick, played to perfection by Dan Hedaya, makes a great appearance late in the season.Also inhabiting the bar is Norm Peterson, an accountant with a penchant for beer. His barstool is never occupied by anyone but him. His relaxed attitude and his relationship with his never-seen wife Vera serve to make him one of the most memorable characters on television during the hayday of the show. His wise answers to everyone's greetings as he entered the bar always bring a laugh.Cheers ran for more than a decade but it is in these early years that it was certainly at the top of its game. The relationship with Sam and Diane, the wisecracks of Norm, Cliff and Carla, the genuine innocence of a naive Woody and the insightfulness of Frasier Crane make this show one of the best comedies of the 80s and certainly one of the best comedies of our generation.The only disappointing thing about the set is the lack of extras, but luckily the show is funny enough to divert attention away from that fact.",4,Welcome Woody,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,3021,"['fourth', 'season', 'Cheers', 'marked', 'beginning', 'new', 'era', 'Boston', 'bar', 'Indiana', 'Woody', 'Boyd', 'came', 'town', 'forever', 'changed', 'face', 'establishment.Replacing', 'beloved', 'hilarious', 'character', 'Coach', 'was', 'easy', 'task', 'Colasanto', 'brought', 'guy', 'life', 'passing', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'someone', 'was', 'needed', 'take', 'place', 'bar', 'Woody', 'was', 'perfect.Boyd', 'portrayed', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'Coach', 'just', 'tried', 'fill', 'where', 'Coach', 'had', 'been', 'own', 'brand', 'humor', 'naivete', 'simple', 'mind', 'were', 'much', 'Coach', 'led', 'great', 'situations', 'season', 'many', 'years', 'come.Of', 'course', 'central', 'Cheers', 'story', 'early', 'years', 'was', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'something', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'witness', 'days', 'when', 'first', 'seasons', 'aired', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'watching', 'Cheers', 'remember', 'had', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'chemistry', 'two', 'original', 'stars', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'brand', 'made', 'incredibly', 'awkward', 'yet', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes.The', 'season', 'Sam', 'returning', 'Europe', 'where', 'went', 'try', 'stop', 'Diane', 'marrying', 'Frasier', 'recurring', 'star', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'year', 'two', 'hint', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'heading', 'other', 'time', 'seem', 'destined', 'be', 'together', 'fall', 'apart', 'season', 'ended', 'Sam', 'city', 'councilwoman', 'serious', 'relationship', 'Diane', 'torn', 'up', 'obviously', 'still', 'feelings', 'Sam', 'vice', 'versa.Adding', 'atmosphere', 'Cheers', 'addition', 'Woody', 'waitress', 'Carla', 'Tortelli', 'wise-cracks', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'directed', 'Diane', 'Cliff', 'mama', 'boy', 'mailman', 'who', 'always', 'trying', 'impress', 'gang', 'obscure', 'knowledge', 'even', 'potatoes', 'look', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Carla', 'view', 'world', 'obviously', 'tinted', 'fact', 'rather', 'large', 'number', 'kids', 'home', 'husband', 'ex', 'Nick', 'played', 'perfection', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'great', 'appearance', 'late', 'season.Also', 'inhabiting', 'bar', 'Norm', 'Peterson', 'accountant', 'penchant', 'beer', 'barstool', 'never', 'occupied', 'anyone', 'relaxed', 'attitude', 'relationship', 'never-seen', 'wife', 'Vera', 'serve', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'television', 'hayday', 'show', 'wise', 'answers', 'everyone', 'greetings', 'entered', 'bar', 'always', 'bring', 'laugh.Cheers', 'ran', 'more', 'decade', 'early', 'years', 'was', 'certainly', 'top', 'game', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'wisecracks', 'Norm', 'Cliff', 'Carla', 'genuine', 'innocence', 'naive', 'Woody', 'insightfulness', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'make', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', '80s', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'generation.The', 'only', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'set', 'lack', 'extras', 'luckily', 'show', 'funny', 'enough', 'divert', 'attention', 'away', 'fact']",N/A

This DVD set contains all the 26 episodes of fourth season in four discs. This season makes two important additions to the series; following the death of Nicholas Colasanto (Coach), the season introduced Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), and Dr. Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth), who becomes match for Frasier. Later both win Emmy awards for their supporting roles. In this season we are presented with very interesting episodes such as when Sam visits Diane in a convent after she returns from Italy. Frasier tries to get over Diane and start dating Lilith. In other episodes, the gang tries to turn the tables on Gary's Old Town Tavern in a bowling match (""From Beer to Eternity""), and in the three-part season finale, Sam begins dating an older woman, a local politician (Kate Mulgrew) running for reelection, and Sam's memorable telephone call asking her to marry him, which many viewers remember.
