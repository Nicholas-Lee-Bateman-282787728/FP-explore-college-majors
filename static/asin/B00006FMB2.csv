714041,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B00006FMB2,&#308;&#308;,"[1, 1]","Let me start out this review by saying that I put off trying this workout for a long time because I had tried several other workouts with this instructor (Sara Ivanhoe) and hadn't liked them.  However, this has quickly become one of my favorite workouts, causing me to want to try some more of her workouts in the future.This workout is focused on relaxing your body and stretching it out.  Therefore, if you're looking for a yoga routine to tone your body, this might not be the best one for you.  The moves in this workout are slow-paced stretching moves that open, relax, and massage the entire body.  Nothing is challenging strength-wise, and this workout should be accessible to all fitness levels-beginner to advanced.  If you're extremely not flexible like me, there are many modifications provided and many people doing them with you so that you don't feel intimidated.  As Sara says, it's really about doing what feels good for your body and not trying to push yourself at all.This program is so flowing that you'll barely notice when you move from one yoga post to another.  There is still such a variety of poses offered with balancing, twisting, or stretching being included in most of them.  It is definitely a yoga workout, but at the same time it's also a stretching workout, making it a perfect alternative to many stretching DVDs.I highly recommend this workout to everyone! Regardless of your level, gender, age, etc. this workout will relax you.  It says on the back that it may even make you sleep better; and after doing this workout, I always fall asleep immediately after.  It has become one of my new favorite workouts, and I don't see myself getting bored from it anytime in the near future.",5,The most relaxing workout I have ever done!,1315008000,"09 3, 2011",2011,1716,"['Let', 'start', 'out', 'review', 'saying', 'put', 'off', 'trying', 'workout', 'long', 'time', 'had', 'tried', 'several', 'other', 'workouts', 'instructor', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'had', ""n't"", 'liked', 'However', 'quickly', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'workouts', 'causing', 'want', 'try', 'more', 'workouts', 'future.This', 'workout', 'focused', 'relaxing', 'body', 'stretching', 'out', 'Therefore', ""'re"", 'looking', 'yoga', 'routine', 'tone', 'body', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'one', 'moves', 'workout', 'are', 'slow-paced', 'stretching', 'moves', 'open', 'relax', 'massage', 'entire', 'body', 'Nothing', 'challenging', 'strength-wise', 'workout', 'should', 'be', 'accessible', 'fitness', 'levels-beginner', 'advanced', ""'re"", 'extremely', 'not', 'flexible', 'are', 'many', 'modifications', 'provided', 'many', 'people', 'doing', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'intimidated', 'Sara', 'really', 'doing', 'what', 'good', 'body', 'not', 'trying', 'push', 'all.This', 'program', 'so', 'flowing', ""'ll"", 'barely', 'notice', 'when', 'move', 'one', 'yoga', 'post', 'still', 'such', 'variety', 'poses', 'offered', 'balancing', 'twisting', 'stretching', 'being', 'included', 'most', 'definitely', 'yoga', 'workout', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'stretching', 'workout', 'making', 'perfect', 'alternative', 'many', 'stretching', 'DVDs.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'workout', 'everyone', 'Regardless', 'level', 'gender', 'age', 'etc', 'workout', 'will', 'relax', 'back', 'may', 'even', 'make', 'sleep', 'better', 'doing', 'workout', 'always', 'fall', 'asleep', 'immediately', 'become', 'one', 'new', 'favorite', 'workouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'getting', 'bored', 'anytime', 'near', 'future']",N/A

I found that i could do all of the stretches in this video, either the 'real' pose or the modified.  i felt a good stretch and my body loosen up in tight areas.  this video starts out with an explaination on how to breathe and that yoga should always be practiced on an empty stomache (something i never knew).  Sarah is very soothing and motivating without being annoying.  i have been practicing pilates for a few months and i find that combining this video and my pilates tapes make for a perfect workout.  i start out with the candlelight yoga video (the full 45 min one), then i move onto a move heart pumping/burning pilates video, i reccommend Burn & Firm pilates and i then do a segment from the Pick your Spot Pilates (ab, thigh, or buns) for extra toning and stretching out at the end of my workout.  I not only reccommend Candlelight Yoga i also reccomment Pick your Spot pilates and Burn & firm pilates.  Pilates is very similar to yoga in that it focuses on breathing (in and out of the nose deeply), stretching and fluid movements to improve flexibility.  so if you enjoy Yoga try pilates, you wont be disappointed!",5,Amazing Yoga Workout !,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,1233,"['Today', 'was', 'first', 'attempt', 'yoga', 'i', 'popped', 'video', 'have', 'say', 'i', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'found', 'i', 'could', 'do', 'stretches', 'video', ""'real"", 'pose', 'modified', 'i', 'felt', 'good', 'stretch', 'body', 'up', 'tight', 'areas', 'video', 'out', 'explaination', 'how', 'breathe', 'yoga', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'practiced', 'empty', 'stomache', 'something', 'i', 'never', 'knew', 'Sarah', 'very', 'soothing', 'motivating', 'being', 'annoying', 'i', 'have', 'been', 'practicing', 'pilates', 'few', 'months', 'i', 'find', 'combining', 'video', 'pilates', 'tapes', 'make', 'perfect', 'workout', 'i', 'start', 'out', 'candlelight', 'yoga', 'video', 'full', '45', 'min', 'one', 'then', 'i', 'move', 'move', 'heart', 'pumping/burning', 'pilates', 'i', 'reccommend', 'Burn', 'Firm', 'i', 'then', 'do', 'segment', 'Pick', 'Spot', 'Pilates', 'ab', 'thigh', 'buns', 'extra', 'toning', 'stretching', 'out', 'end', 'workout', 'not', 'only', 'reccommend', 'Candlelight', 'Yoga', 'i', 'also', 'reccomment', 'Pick', 'Spot', 'pilates', 'Burn', 'firm', 'Pilates', 'very', 'similar', 'yoga', 'breathing', 'nose', 'deeply', 'stretching', 'fluid', 'movements', 'improve', 'flexibility', 'so', 'enjoy', 'Yoga', 'try', 'pilates', 'wont', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

The practice begins in a seated position, and Sara takes time to explain yoga breathing and to allow for practice.  This is followed by gentle seated stretches and twists, all the while focused on smooth, relaxing breathing.  Next comes a slow-moving sun salutation series with simplified versions of most poses--eg, Eagle pose done with arms only, not legs.  Sara includes lunges, balancing, and simple backbends but leaves out other classic standing poses such as Warrior and Triangle.  Following the standing series, the practice returns to the floor for some seated forward bends, and finally, there is a relaxation series at the end.Sara is an easy-going instructor who frequently encourages you to go only as far as comfortable and not to strain; she lead a class of students who show various levels of modifications.  The video is set in a Crunch studio, and although there are candles, it is bright with other lighting; the music is soft and in the background.

There is also an option on the DVD that allows you to have Sara instruct without the background music so you can use your own music.As an absolute beginner, I tried the Rodney Yee and Yoga Journal's DVD's when I first started and I was overwhelmed.

I need a short morning routine because I'm too rushed before work, and then a longer PM routine because I'm too wound up to sleep.  It had great reviews so I Netflixed it.  I've found this dvd to be highly overrated.  So glad I rented before buying!The energizing session- no sun salutation!  I don't think I've ever encountered that!  It definitely felt like something was missing.  Even the 10 minute AM session from YogaWorks has a sun salutation!  It is essential for an energizing routine!!The music- it doesn't bother me, per se, but it is too loud.  And when the instructor stops talking, it gets even louder!  You can turn the music off on the audio setup, but then it's almost too quiet.  I like a bit of soft music in the background as a white noise that keeps you from focusing on the cars outside, the kids upstairs, the dryer buzzing, etc... I wish you could adjust the music volume separate from the instructor.I don't get the candles.  The studio is so bright you could perform surgery in there.  They don't really add any ambiance, they actually just look stupid because it's so bright in there.  They don't look aromatic; if they were then maybe I could see why they're using them.And your breathing should sound like Darth Vader?  Give me a break!  What a silly thing to say.  Plus, Vader is a total mouth breather and you should breathe through the nose.  If you're sounding like Vader something is wrong!There are too many people on the set, I think, and they all look like some uber-trendy yoga clique that want everyone to know how cool they are for doing yoga.  They look like some of the people I did yoga with in high school (early 90s) with their Hindu shirts from the local head shop, etc...The movements themselves are good.  It is a good routine for beginner to intermediate.  The flow would be better if the standing poses were done in the beginning (relaxation routine).

Fuchsia mats have been spread around a wood floor in a room filled with vanilla candles. The candles are on the floor, up on stands, simply everywhere!The curtains flow gently between brick walls and in the background you can see an opaque glass window. Sara is wearing a beautiful blue top while everyone in the room is also wearing colors of equal beauty. Imagine violet, lime green, lemon yellow, orange and powdery blue.This workout reminds me of yoga in a temple. There is a spirituality about the entire workout that is different than the outdoor workouts or more strenuous vinyasa type workouts. This video tends to encourage you to relax more and look inward to encourage your inner beauty.The purpose of this workout is to teach you to relax at will. Halfway through the workout, I was ready to just climb into bed and sleep blissfully until morning. The music and candlelight allows the tension to drain from your body as you breathe deeply.The instructor has been doing yoga for a long time and she says learning to relax at will allows you to be in control of your energy. With Sara Ivanhoe giving you gentle instruction, you can stretch your way into tranquility. I loved her instruction, it was calming and you can see her inner beauty, calm and love for yoga.Some of the poses include: cat pose, arch curl, side stretch, downward dog, sitting twists, tree pose, butterfly stretch.

These poses melt the body into sleep and must have been chosen to release tension and improve balance and flexibility.You will need a sticky mat, a towel and a cushion.

Since I'm getting back into working out after a long hiatus I figured this might be a good start for me since my loss of time working my muscles has caused them to become weak and inflexible.I guess I made a good choice.  Again, since I've had no previous experience with yoga I have nothing to compare this to.  This DVD was not too strenuous.  As a beginner there were a few moves I found a bit difficult to hold, but the instructor is great about constantly reminding you to not overdo it and has one person showing frequent modifications.I did find it to be rather relaxing.

But I highly recommend this to people who are new to yoga, or those more experienced who want a really soothing and relaxing video. Sara Ivanhoe is a great instructor, she isn't intimidating in the least, does a good job of explaining the postures as well as emphasizing the importance of breathing.You start out with breathing where Sara explains how to breathe, etc. Then you move into a vinyasa, which is a flowing series of postures coordinated with the breath. It gets you familiar with some of the terminology. Then you move into some simple postures that stretch you out nicely. Some of the poses are a little tricky, the tree pose is a balancing posture that I always have trouble with but I am getting better. There is also a nice shoulder stretch which isn't easy, then you finish out with runners lunge (stretch), then into some forward bends once with legs together, and then in a straddle position. My flexibility continues to improve with the forward bends. Then it's on to the final relaxation pose.All in all, a great video.
