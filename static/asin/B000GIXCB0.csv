1004683,A3BNEHJN2XN3TY,B000GIXCB0,"Sci Fi Lover ""Sci Fi Lover""","[0, 0]","Tough Enough is a terrific movie.  Dennis Quaid plays a landscaper who wants to be a country singer.  He takes part in a Tough Man Competition to earn money to pay his bills.  Dennis Quaid had mentioned in interviews that he did some boxing when he was young but I did not think he would be this good.  I have to say that I felt badly everytime he was hit in the head although it only a movie, because he is so handsome.",5,Dennis Quaid is an excellent boxer,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,420,"['Tough', 'Enough', 'terrific', 'movie', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'landscaper', 'who', 'be', 'country', 'singer', 'part', 'Tough', 'Man', 'Competition', 'earn', 'money', 'pay', 'bills', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'had', 'mentioned', 'interviews', 'did', 'boxing', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'have', 'say', 'felt', 'badly', 'everytime', 'was', 'hit', 'head', 'only', 'movie', 'so', 'handsome']",Tough Enough
1004684,A2F2BJTA5L1GHY,B000GIXCB0,Siriam,"[0, 0]","I bought this as a fan of Warren Oates whose last film this is. Based it seems on a real annual national amateur boxing contest, the film's story is pretty predictable. With enough scams and manipulation by the sharp witted competition promoter (Oates as ever watchable) and disappointments for the various contestants to keep the story rolling it is a pretty easy on the eye and mind. Dennis Quaid in an early major role is not very convincing and the script despite some attempts to break out of the ""poor boy makes good"" main theme  by reference to racist aspects of the competition (cue Pam Grier) and struggles of an aspiring country singer forced to turn to boxing for the money) really does not progress much beyond standard B movie/TV film fare.Watchable but not exceptional.",3,A tad disappointing,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,783,"['bought', 'fan', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'last', 'film', 'Based', 'real', 'annual', 'national', 'amateur', 'boxing', 'contest', 'film', 'story', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'enough', 'scams', 'manipulation', 'sharp', 'witted', 'competition', 'promoter', 'Oates', 'ever', 'watchable', 'disappointments', 'various', 'contestants', 'keep', 'story', 'rolling', 'pretty', 'easy', 'eye', 'mind', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'early', 'major', 'role', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'script', 'attempts', 'break', 'poor', 'boy', 'good', 'main', 'theme', 'reference', 'racist', 'aspects', 'competition', 'cue', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'struggles', 'aspiring', 'country', 'singer', 'forced', 'turn', 'boxing', 'money', 'really', 'not', 'progress', 'much', 'standard', 'B', 'movie/TV', 'film', 'fare.Watchable', 'not', 'exceptional']",Tough Enough
