My toddler is very picky about what she watches but I purchased this because her speech is a little delayed for her age. When I first played it, I was sure she would protest because it seems s-o-o boring. On the contrary, she has requested to see it several times and can see it over & over, back-to-back. I wish it had the option for ""repeat play"" though, because it's only 30 minutes long (could have gotten 5 stars if it had this feature). Aside from that, it was definitely worth the money. Whether she actually learns from it or not is yet to be determined.",4,My 2 year Old Likes It.,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,592,"['Just', 'bought', 'Christmas', 'toddler', 'very', 'picky', 'what', 'purchased', 'speech', 'little', 'delayed', 'age', 'When', 'first', 'played', 'was', 'sure', 'would', 'protest', 's-o-o', 'boring', 'contrary', 'requested', 'see', 'several', 'times', 'can', 'see', 'over', 'back-to-back', 'wish', 'had', 'option', 'repeat', 'play', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', '5', 'stars', 'had', 'feature', 'Aside', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', 'money', 'actually', 'not', 'yet', 'be', 'determined']",N/A

I generally don't want her watching TV because it numbs the brain. This however is an exception because it is very educational.I also like the fact that it is not overly polished like so many TV shows are.I noticed that some reviewers complain that it is boring to them. Well, this was not made to entertain adults! It is a kids DVD and both entertains and educates very well.My only complaint is that it is only 30 minutes.

675163,A3IQQJPGZ2RDN7,B00005QFDY,Learner,"[20, 21]","Our two-year old daughter loves this video. I highly recommend it.The animation is basic, but it's not the sort of thing little kids care about. The content and educational value are first-rate. It does a great job of introducing all the 26 letters. To keep kids' interest, it mixes in a lot of interesting characters and stories. Our daughter loves the sweet animal characters. It includes the traditional ""ABC"" song, which is very helpful.We like that the presentation is low-key, not like some of the loud, frenetically paced stuff you see nowadays. If your kids see a lot of TV, they might have a different reaction than our daughter did to this video. We don't let her watch a lot of video unless it's educational (studies show TV and rapidly changing video images are not healthy for kids' brain development, especially before age 3).In addition to this video, for learning the alphabet I also recommend the video ""Leap Frog - Letter Factory (2003).""

Every single kid loves it.It has the same characters as the Scarry books. The kids' voices seem real without being too cute or weirdly adult (like the unnerving Peanuts kids' voices are.) The video has a very calm and mellow feel. Not boring, just smooth, understated and engaging. No whiz bang hijinks or frantic mugging. The kids just get absorbed in it and it holds their attention for its full length.The kid characters are well-behaved and adults are caring, trustworthy and capable. If there is any message besides the actual alphabet it is that effort is rewarded, school is fun and learning is worthwhile.

675166,A3X3VQV4S5MWJ,B00005QFDY,"Tha Queen Bee ""2BiizziiBeez""","[62, 62]","I had to take time out to write this review. I purchased Richard Scarry's ABC'S and Counting DVD last week. We haven't had the video a week yet and he's asked for both videos EVERY DAY more than once a day (he's watching it right now actually). We, actually, got a Charlie Brown Valentine's Day DVD today and he chose these DVD's over Charlie Brown! My son memorized the phonics of each letter but not all of the actual letter names (ex. he'll say FFFF instead of F). I didn't realize he'd be so attached to this DVD. I can't say enough good things about it. It's not computer graphics, this was made back in the day when you actually drew the cartoon wich I, personally, prefer and lucky for me my son doesn't care one way or the other.The video has a letter and a small story for each letter with alot of the featured letter. I like that the kids names start with the letter they're talking about (Letter L has Libby talking about Lowley drinking Lemonade). The counting video goes up to 20 wich is why I purchased it, most only go up to 10. He's learning alot from the counting video because he only knows his numbers up to 10, he already knows most of his alphabet but doesn't know how to read yet so the video could help teach him. We own every leapfrog product known to man and TONS of books and the Hooked On Phonics set but anything that'll help is welcome.This video and the counting video are EXCELLENT and HIGHLY recommended. The only Alphabet DVD (besides this one) I can highly recommend is LeapFrog's Letter Factory. It's more polished but it teaches the phonics of the words just like the toys do. Leapfrog's Talking Words Factory 1&2 are also highly recommended but NOT Math Circus, don't waste your money on that one. I'm going to purchase Richard Scarry's The Best Learning Video, I hope it's as good as the other 2.",5,My almost 3 year old son  LOVES this video!!,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,1834,"['had', 'take', 'time', 'write', 'review', 'purchased', 'Richard', 'Scarry', 'ABC', 'Counting', 'DVD', 'last', 'week', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'video', 'week', 'yet', 'asked', 'videos', 'EVERY', 'DAY', 'more', 'once', 'day', 'watching', 'right', 'now', 'actually', 'actually', 'got', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'DVD', 'today', 'chose', 'DVD', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'son', 'memorized', 'phonics', 'letter', 'not', 'actual', 'letter', 'names', 'ex', ""'ll"", 'say', 'FFFF', 'instead', 'F', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', ""'d"", 'be', 'so', 'attached', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'not', 'computer', 'graphics', 'was', 'made', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'actually', 'drew', 'cartoon', 'wich', 'personally', 'prefer', 'lucky', 'son', ""n't"", 'care', 'one', 'way', 'other.The', 'video', 'letter', 'small', 'story', 'letter', 'alot', 'featured', 'letter', 'like', 'kids', 'names', 'start', 'letter', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Letter', 'L', 'Libby', 'talking', 'Lowley', 'drinking', 'Lemonade', 'counting', 'video', 'up', '20', 'wich', 'why', 'purchased', 'most', 'only', 'go', 'up', '10', 'learning', 'alot', 'counting', 'video', 'only', 'numbers', 'up', '10', 'already', 'most', 'alphabet', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'read', 'yet', 'so', 'video', 'could', 'help', 'teach', 'own', 'leapfrog', 'product', 'known', 'man', 'TONS', 'books', 'Hooked', 'Phonics', 'set', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'help', 'welcome.This', 'video', 'counting', 'video', 'are', 'EXCELLENT', 'HIGHLY', 'recommended', 'only', 'Alphabet', 'DVD', 'one', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'LeapFrog', 'Letter', 'Factory', 'more', 'polished', 'phonics', 'words', 'just', 'toys', 'do', 'Leapfrog', 'Talking', 'Words', 'Factory', '1', '2', 'are', 'also', 'highly', 'recommended', 'NOT', 'Math', 'Circus', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'one', ""'m"", 'going', 'purchase', 'Richard', 'Scarry', 'Best', 'Learning', 'Video', 'hope', 'as', 'good', 'other', '2']",N/A
