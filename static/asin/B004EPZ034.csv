1402438,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004EPZ034,A kids review,"[3, 8]","The Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise isn't exactly held up as a paragon of contemporary cinema, but even for its low standards, its latest installment, Chipwrecked, failed on pretty much every level. In this third animated/live-action romp, the titular trio and their female counterparts are stranded on a deserted island when a parasailing mishap leads them astray; caretaker Dave and his old boss Ian work together to locate and rescue their furry friends. I found the film forgettable, with recycled humor and lazy writing that made for an obnoxious and unfunny moviegoing experience. But, as with so many movies of this nature, I must keep in mind that I am not the target audience here, and must concede that if you're just looking for something mindless to keep your very young children at bay for a couple of hours, this might do the trick.",1,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,848,"['Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'franchise', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'held', 'up', 'paragon', 'contemporary', 'cinema', 'even', 'low', 'standards', 'latest', 'installment', 'Chipwrecked', 'failed', 'pretty', 'much', 'level', 'third', 'animated/live-action', 'romp', 'titular', 'trio', 'female', 'counterparts', 'are', 'stranded', 'deserted', 'island', 'when', 'parasailing', 'mishap', 'astray', 'caretaker', 'Dave', 'old', 'boss', 'Ian', 'work', 'together', 'locate', 'rescue', 'furry', 'friends', 'found', 'film', 'forgettable', 'recycled', 'humor', 'lazy', 'writing', 'made', 'obnoxious', 'unfunny', 'moviegoing', 'experience', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'nature', 'must', 'keep', 'mind', 'am', 'not', 'target', 'audience', 'here', 'must', 'concede', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'something', 'mindless', 'keep', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'bay', 'couple', 'hours', 'might', 'do', 'trick']",N/A

I have two girls (5 and 7) that I have shared these with, and they loved the Chipmunk Adventure movie especially.  So it seemed natural to check this out when it hit Blu-Ray, with a little apprehension.  The last few CGI/live action mixed movies we have seen were just kind of ""okay"" at best (""Hop"" and ""The Smurfs""), however this is MUCH better than both of those films put together.  It's a kids movie at heart, don't get that wrong, but there's plenty of pop culture and internet culture references thrown in for good measure.  Theodore exclaiming over a double rainbow (""what does it mean?"") and great chunks from the movie Castaway.  The music is poppy and entertaining and Alvin is up to his old tricks as usual (it wouldn't be a Chipmunk movie without him getting into trouble!) Jason Lee makes a good Dave, and has definitely got the ""ALVIIIIN"" yell down pat by now.The story is predictable but not overly so, and has enough action and laughs to keep it flowing.  The movie never really bogs down, which is a good thing, and keeps at a nice pace, despite falling back on an overused shipwrecked type setting.

1402452,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004EPZ034,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Alvin & the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked is really good.  You know, I'm surprised just how good it is.  As a kid of the 80's I loved the cartoon.  I loved the mischievous adventures that Alvin would get into.  I loved the way he'd always get under Dave's skin.  I loved the renditions of popular 80's songs such as the Cars ""Shake It Up"" and Madonna's ""Material Girl"", but these current movies are probably even better.  They step up the excitement level a few more notches.This one is about Alvin and the gang getting stuck on a desert island after floating away on a kite.  Dave and their crooked manager from the previous films makes a return, and he's actually fairly tame, friendly, reasonable and likeable this time around.  The female chipmunks return as well.  Perhaps the only complaint I have (besides all the cheesy singing and dancing) is the constant need for the chipmunks to sing current music from the likes of Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber.  These songs won't last over the long term and therefore won't be remembered several years from now.  The writers should stick with the classics instead.Anyway, when the chipmunks have to fend for themselves on a deserted island, this is when all chaos breaks loose.  They meet a woman who's been there for 7-8 years and well, she's mentally unstable and clearly lost her marbles!  She's there because she's on a quest for gold.  Meanwhile the chipmunks just want to be rescued.  They worry that Dave might not be coming, but... will he?  You'll have to watch it to find out!Overall, pretty solid jokes (though a little more childish this time around) and great storytelling and entertainment for the entire family guaranteed (if you're a chipmunks fan, that is).  Perhaps the relationship between Alvin and Dave is more sentimental than usual as well.  Isn't Theodore just adorable?  Yes!  And the heroics of Simon as a result of a spider bite?

Overall, Chipwrecked shows that there's still some life to the franchise, although probably not enough for a fourth movie. On the one hand, the Chipmunks themselves were as funny as ever. We actually see the characters develop and begin to poke fun at their stereotypes. I particularly loved how Simon went ""nuts"" and transformed into a French Rambo. The flirtation between Simon and Jeannette was adorable.The human actors did disappoint. Dave is Dave and was fine for the most part. Ian returns wearing a funny pelican suit. Still, I feel like the writers didn't really squeeze out all of the humor they could have gotten out of that character (although his speech near the end was classic). The big disappointment was Zoey, Zoey is a new character, a castaway stuck on the island where the Chipmunks land. Aside from a few funny references to Tom Hanks' movie Cast Away - including sports balls with eyes and mouths - her character just doesn't add a whole lot to the movie. She seems awkward and out of place at times. At times, I kept wishing she would go away so the camera could focus on the Chipmunks. Fortunately, despite my complaints, she's actually not in too much of the movie, but it still would have been better to either make her do something important, make her funny, or make her go away.Ultimately, I'm glad we got Chipmunks 3. If there's another one, I think it'll really have to focus on the Chipmunks and their humor, and leave the humans out of it.",4,"The Chipmunks franchise still has it after 3 movies, but barely",1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,1606,"['Where', 'first', 'Chipmunks', 'movie', 'was', 'cute', 'never', 'really', 'saw', 'multi-film', 'franchise', 'Lo', 'behold', ""'re"", 'already', 'film', 'three', 'Chipwrecked', 'shows', 'still', 'life', 'franchise', 'probably', 'not', 'enough', 'fourth', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'Chipmunks', 'were', 'as', 'funny', 'ever', 'actually', 'see', 'characters', 'develop', 'begin', 'poke', 'fun', 'stereotypes', 'particularly', 'loved', 'how', 'Simon', 'went', 'nuts', 'transformed', 'French', 'Rambo', 'flirtation', 'Simon', 'Jeannette', 'was', 'adorable.The', 'human', 'actors', 'did', 'disappoint', 'Dave', 'Dave', 'was', 'fine', 'most', 'part', 'Ian', 'wearing', 'funny', 'pelican', 'suit', 'Still', 'feel', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'squeeze', 'out', 'humor', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'character', 'speech', 'end', 'was', 'classic', 'big', 'disappointment', 'was', 'Zoey', 'Zoey', 'new', 'character', 'castaway', 'stuck', 'island', 'where', 'Chipmunks', 'land', 'Aside', 'few', 'funny', 'references', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movie', 'Cast', 'Away', 'including', 'sports', 'balls', 'eyes', 'mouths', 'character', 'just', ""n't"", 'add', 'whole', 'lot', 'movie', 'awkward', 'place', 'times', 'times', 'kept', 'wishing', 'would', 'go', 'away', 'so', 'camera', 'could', 'focus', 'Chipmunks', 'Fortunately', 'complaints', 'actually', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'make', 'do', 'something', 'important', 'make', 'funny', 'make', 'go', 'away.Ultimately', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'Chipmunks', '3', 'one', 'think', ""'ll"", 'really', 'have', 'focus', 'Chipmunks', 'humor', 'leave', 'humans']",N/A

Then they fall off the ship along with Dave & Ian (yes he's back, and good thing! He brings the comedy to this one!) and get stranded on an island. They seem to copy parts from other movies in this, such as finding someone stranded on the island who talks to basketballs & golf balls (sound familiar...Wilson) and when Jenette is being lowered into a cave to bring up gold for her kidnapper (just like Disney's The Rescuers- the 1st one). For adults watching, the only good thing about this one was the song choices, Lady Gaga, Rihanna etc sung by the chipmunks throughout which all sounded great, especially S.O.S sung by Jenette in the cave & the end songs performed by all 6 chipmunks on stage.

We loved the last chipmunk movie so we had high expectations for this one.  Personally, I wasn't sure that they would be able to carry on the franchise in a way that was interesting and fresh man was I wrong. We sang through the whole movie. It is a really cute story. Goddess was in love with all the music. She has a favorite chipmunk and stated so through the whole movie. Handsome liked anytime Dave and Ian were on screen. He thinks the Chipmunks former manger is hysterical especially in the pelican suit.In Chipwrecked, Dave takes the Chipmunks and the Chippettes on a cruise. Alvin of course ends up getting them all grounded while Dave heads to dinner to talk with the captain. Poor little Theodore ends up watching TV that is way too scary for him. My kids thought it was so cute how he couldn't just change the channel and sat there mesmerized at the creepy images before his eyes. They do the same if they wake in the middle of the night to see us watching something on Sci-Fi.When everyone ends up overboard the chipmunks must work together to survive on an island, and yes, they do sing ""I'm a survivor"". The songs are some of the best parts of the movie!If you have chipmunk fans in the house, you can't go wrong with this family friendly movie. Yes, I have seen some reviews were people talk about the ""suggestive"" dance moves of the Chippettes but I was watching the same stuff on the Bugs Bunny Show and Tom and Jerry too.

1402507,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B004EPZ034,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 2]","Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor all become marooned on a desert island when another of Alvin's wild schemes goes awry, this time while on a vacation cruise to an international music awards show overseas. In an attempt to rescue them, Dave soon gets stranded too, and even evil ""Uncle"" Ian is along for the adventure. Meanwhile, the `munks are not in the best of hands, as they have fallen into a friendship of sorts with another castaway, a woman named Zoe who is clearly not all there and definitely not concerned with anyone's safety.This third installment in the Chipmunks' bigscreen/live-action franchise was yet another huge hit, and that probably means those of us who enjoy the Chipmunks can look forward to another film down the pipeline (hopefully keeping Jason Lee and keeping to the bigscreen. However, this one has been hit pretty hard in the reviews department. People generally didn't like it and consider it a cheap, contrived cash grab. But, ya know what? A LOT of those people seem to say that about any live-action film with CGI cartoon stars, even without ever seeing the movie. It's a kinda prejudice that exists these days against certain kinds of movies, especially ones with the younger audience as priority. Yes, they are all cash grabs; that doesn't mean they can't be good films. And, you've also got tons of people out there who could never find this sort of thing entertaining because their brains are too ""old"". They see this as just a movie to take their kids to, and something they have to suffer through. They would never ALLOW themselves to enjoy it. So, all I'm saying is, be careful whose advice you take about ANY movie's worth. See it yourself, and if you know you're not going to like it because it is a Chipmunks movie or a live-action cartoon, or whatever else, before you even see the film, then even if you do see it, you might as well keep your opinion to yourself. Just because they are not your genre does not mean they are all garbage.So, speaking to those who were open minded about the first film (which was a very good film, and any negatives I've heard on it came from people like I've described above or that breed of fan who thinks the 80's version of the Chipmunks IS and SHOULD ALWAYS BE the only way they are ever done), longtime Chipmunk fans like myself or not, this movie is NOT as bad as everyone has said. It's not as good as the first one, but I'd say it is as good as the second, and at least we don't get a replacement Dave here for the bulk of the film. Now, this film IS more pandering to the kid audience, as the second one was (this one might be worse in that department), and there are a few cringe-worthy moments of over-the-top silliness, like with the second film, which usually has to do with how some humans interact with the chipmunks. In this film, I was not crazy about the skanky club-girl dance off the Chipettes had early on. And, no doubt, a lot of people probably found the Zoe character a bit annoying. I think that she was supposed to be a little bit, but comedic personalities like her are often annoying to many people. She was still pretty funny. And the main characters, Dave, the Chipmunks, the Chipettes, and Ian were back in perfect form. If you're someone who watches this movie more for the Chipmunks than anything else, I'd take a guess that they get most of the screen time this go-round. But, like I said, we thankfully see a lot more of Dave, which the second film lacked.Anyway, as for the story, yeah, it's pretty simple, and of course it's contrived. That's the nature of cartoon character stories, especially those largely rooted in the world of television. The entertainment comes from the characters, how they handle things, how they interact with others, etc... It's about personalities, and these characters are the same as they ever were. Not surprising, since the same folks who created the 80's TV series are strong forces behind these newer films (so, don't give me the ""it's nothing like the 80's Chipmunks"" routine, your hindsight is rose-colored). But, as usual, there are lessons to be learned here all around, and they are well done. It's a film about learning to be responsible when necessary, and parents learning to trust their kids when necessary (and that they've managed to teach them a thing or two), and even about learning to forgive and be a better person. Yeah, those are just a few lessons you can pull from this film, but it IS well done.And, oh, did you know there's music in this too? Yeah, the Chipmunks sing a lot in this. Though, I think for some people this was still a weak point since the songs are mostly current (or recent), and not everyone keeps up with that stuff. I've heard some folks say they only recognized the first song in the film (""Vacation""), but I am sure that's not really true. Surely they recognize the Lady Gaga songs too, at the very least. Anyway, this was not a big issue for me, but I suppose a lot of the oldschool fans would like to see a few more oldschool tunes in any future installments.""Alvin and the Chipmunks - Chipwrecked"" is technically consistent with the 2 previous films. The visuals are highest quality, the characters are the same as we remember, and the story may be contrived for some, but as a chipmunks story it is fitting enough and makes way for the personality-driven entertainment, as a good, comedic cartoon plot should. Many will complain about the pop culture humor, especially the kind that panders to the youngest or that which some folks find tacky, but the Chipmunks are the very definition of pop-culture exploitation, let's face it. It's what they do. If you don't like it, watch something else. For the few moments of jokes that might leave older viewers clueless, most of the rest of the film is pretty universally understandable and entertaining, especially if you have been a fan of these characters for a looong time. Bottom-line, this is a fine Chipmunks movie. It's not as good as the first in this series, but that one focused the most on entertaining the oldschool fans. The sequels, yes, HAVE pandered more to the younger set (though at least they brought in the Chipmunks for us), but there is still plenty of fun and funny here, as well as consistency with the previous two films, that anyone who liked the other two should be able to enjoy this one too. It may be your least favorite, maybe not, but it's worthwhile if the Chipmunks are your thing, and if that isn't ONLY the 80's Chipmunks. Hey, I grew up with them too, I just think a lot of my fellow fans have that version on a pedestal. I think that's more the fault of the 80's bigscreen feature than the actual TV show, ha. Anyway, I do recommend this to those who saw the previous two. If you didn't, then why are you even here?Now, a word about the Blu-Ray release. This Blu-Ray comes with a DVD and a digital copy. I don't use digital copies, so I won't talk about that. I think the DVD's are a nice inclusion, though if I'm paying more to get it, I'd rather just have the Blu-Ray and keep the price down. Anyway, there is a nice selection of behind the scenes featurettes here that talk a lot about the Chipmunks, the Bagdasarians (the family behind the Chipmunks), the film, and everything else. There is unfortunately no commentary, but we do get extended scenes and a lot of options for singing and dancing along to the songs. The trailers are also included, as well as a short Scrat cartoon (from ""Ice Age"") and a trailer for ""Mirror, Mirror"", which you may be glad to know if you, like me, consider Lily Collins (Phil's daughter) to be an absolute goddess (even if the movie and her enhanced eyebrows look over-the-top silly). But, I digress. ""Chipwrecked"" naturally looks fantastic on Blu-Ray, so if you can't get enough of the Chipmunks and those adorable Chipettes, yeah, you'll wanna pick this one up.",4,The Chipmunks get

When viewing a movie like this, that is obviously made for young children please keep in mind it is primarily for their entertainment.  Most adults aren't going to find it terribly exciting.I took my son to see it, and while it would not have been my first choice of movie, he loved it, and his enjoyment made it fun for me as well.  If you have a child who already loves the Chipmunks, this will probaby be right up their alley.  Lots of upbeat, chirpy songs, plenty of action.  Alvin is his usual mischevious self, though in the course of the story he does find that he can be the responsible one when he needs to be.  Silly jokes and humor, certainly.

At this point I was expected no more character introductions and just a great Chipmunk story. Unfortunately I was not to happy with what I got.'Chipwrekced', was nothing but a simple no effort film that ties up all the lose ends that the predecessors left behind. Also, it was an attempt to place stupid pop culture references all through-out the movie. Of course I will admit there were some very cute moments and jokes. Even more so a little bit of character development, but a very small amount. The music of course is always a Chipmunk staple, but it this film the flow of the songs was just very unorganized and a little over done.At this point I think it is safe to say that this franchise is history, it was nice to have a brief moment of Chipmunk-Mania, especially since these characters have been in the public eye since the late 1950's. Still, if you want to have a proper send off, you gotta give it some effort. Will there be a 4th film...if there is I would not be shocked, even if it was just a made for video release. Will I see it...unless they fix what they broke, definitely not...I'm munked out for now.",2,Franchise Ruined!,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,1310,"['finally', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'third', 'installment', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'childhood', 'characters', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'two', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'films', 'excited', 'see', 'new', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'expected', 'no', 'more', 'character', 'introductions', 'just', 'great', 'Chipmunk', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'what', 'got', ""'Chipwrekced"", 'was', 'nothing', 'simple', 'effort', 'film', 'up', 'lose', 'ends', 'predecessors', 'left', 'behind', 'Also', 'was', 'attempt', 'place', 'stupid', 'pop', 'culture', 'movie', 'course', 'will', 'admit', 'were', 'very', 'cute', 'moments', 'jokes', 'Even', 'more', 'so', 'little', 'bit', 'character', 'development', 'very', 'small', 'amount', 'music', 'course', 'always', 'Chipmunk', 'staple', 'film', 'flow', 'songs', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'unorganized', 'little', 'done.At', 'point', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'franchise', 'history', 'was', 'nice', 'have', 'brief', 'moment', 'Chipmunk-Mania', 'especially', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'public', 'eye', 'late', '1950', 'Still', 'want', 'have', 'proper', 'send', 'off', 'got', 'ta', 'give', 'effort', 'Will', 'there', 'be', '4th', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'shocked', 'even', 'was', 'just', 'made', 'video', 'release', 'Will', 'see', 'fix', 'what', 'broke', 'definitely', 'not', ""'m"", 'munked', 'out', 'now']",N/A
