575690,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005A0QC,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Murder on Flight 502, 1975 filmThe movie begins with a view of an airport (JFK on Long Island). There is a flight to London. We see the passengers and their characters. One man is tense and nervous. These passengers wait in the First Class lounge. A man could carry a pistol on a trans-Atlantic flight. ""Didn't you used to be Jack Ainsley Marshall?"" This Boeing 747 is cleared for take-off. Back at the first-class lounge a package smokes, they call security. A bad joke? An unsigned letter tells about murders on Flight 502! They warn the pilot. The police sergeant is consulted: psychopaths can look like anyone. One passenger is a surgeon on a confidential mission. ""Do you want the truth?"" Who stole a serving fork? The passengers talk about themselves. Then one man suffers a heart attack. There is drama in the treatment. A life is saved. A mystery writer makes an observation about a passenger. This is confirmed back at JFK.There is an attack on one passenger, we learn who stole that serving fork, and why. Why do kids use drugs? They get involved with the wrong people. Marshall shows his wisdom. Can getting a drink of water be dangerous? Is there a place to hide at 38,000 feet? ""Did anyone see anything?"" Someone is looking into suitcases. A flight attendant brings a tray to the flight crew. The captain announces the news to the first-class passengers. One man fears for his life. Then there is another surprise when the murderer reveals his identity. A shot causes a fire in the first-class lounge! They must make an emergency landing now. ""What a nightmare!"" The captain solves the mystery of the planted money. The murderer's talk tells of his mental state. ""A fine job.""This seems to be made for television because of its low production values. It has some actors who are near the end of their careers, and some who are becoming famous. [I had a hunch before the murderer was revealed.] Parts of it reminded me of the 1934 film ""Mystery Liner"" or Agatha Christie's famous ""Ten Little Indians"". It's a good film overall, but one character seems implausible.",3,Murders in a Locked Room,1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,2075,"['Murder', 'Flight', '502', '1975', 'filmThe', 'movie', 'view', 'airport', 'JFK', 'Long', 'Island', 'flight', 'London', 'see', 'passengers', 'characters', 'One', 'man', 'tense', 'nervous', 'passengers', 'wait', 'First', 'Class', 'lounge', 'man', 'could', 'carry', 'pistol', 'trans-Atlantic', 'flight', 'Did', ""n't"", 'used', 'be', 'Jack', 'Ainsley', 'Marshall', 'Boeing', '747', 'cleared', 'take-off', 'Back', 'first-class', 'lounge', 'package', 'smokes', 'call', 'security', 'bad', 'joke', 'unsigned', 'letter', 'tells', 'murders', 'Flight', '502', 'warn', 'pilot', 'police', 'sergeant', 'consulted', 'psychopaths', 'can', 'look', 'anyone', 'One', 'passenger', 'surgeon', 'confidential', 'mission', 'Do', 'want', 'truth', 'Who', 'stole', 'serving', 'fork', 'passengers', 'talk', 'Then', 'one', 'man', 'heart', 'attack', 'drama', 'treatment', 'life', 'saved', 'mystery', 'writer', 'observation', 'passenger', 'confirmed', 'back', 'JFK.There', 'attack', 'one', 'passenger', 'learn', 'who', 'stole', 'serving', 'fork', 'why', 'Why', 'do', 'kids', 'use', 'drugs', 'get', 'involved', 'wrong', 'people', 'Marshall', 'wisdom', 'Can', 'getting', 'drink', 'water', 'be', 'dangerous', 'place', 'hide', '38,000', 'feet', 'Did', 'anyone', 'see', 'anything', 'Someone', 'looking', 'suitcases', 'flight', 'attendant', 'tray', 'flight', 'crew', 'captain', 'news', 'first-class', 'passengers', 'One', 'man', 'life', 'Then', 'surprise', 'when', 'murderer', 'identity', 'shot', 'fire', 'first-class', 'lounge', 'must', 'make', 'emergency', 'landing', 'now', 'What', 'nightmare', 'captain', 'mystery', 'planted', 'money', 'murderer', 'talk', 'tells', 'mental', 'state', 'fine', 'job', 'be', 'made', 'television', 'low', 'production', 'values', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'end', 'careers', 'who', 'are', 'becoming', 'famous', '[', 'had', 'hunch', 'murderer', 'was', 'revealed', ']', 'Parts', 'reminded', '1934', 'film', 'Mystery', 'Liner', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'famous', 'Ten', 'Little', 'Indians', 'good', 'film', 'overall', 'one', 'character', 'implausible']",N/A

575692,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00005A0QC,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[16, 17]","This review is dedicated to Farrah Fawcett.I will begin by saying that that the media shoud be ASHAMED of itself for virtually ignoring the death of Farrah Fawcett. Farrah Fawcett was a wonderful human being.That said, this is a great 70s horror. Everything starts peaceful and nice, and even a bit comical as different characters board a flight to England.Within a few minutes a smoke bomb is uncovered at the airport. (We later see that despite the possible dangerous consequences, the person only meant it as a joke and didn't want anyone to be hurt or too scared for that matter.) However, because of this, an airport security man finds a letter he wasn't suppose to find until the next day. (This letter states that he is plotting to murder more than one person on the plane.) GREAT SUSPENSE!Robert Stack gets major kudos as the pilot who must keep his cool with the flying of course, and simultaneously figure out what to do. Farrah Fawcett also gets major kudos as the Stewardess who does her normal duties but may know more than she is letting on to.It's hard to write much without ruining the movie. But we have several suspects. We have a doctor (Ralph Bellamy) who has been threatened by a man on flight. He feels his wife died because Dr. (Ralph Bellamy) couldn't be contacted or found. We have a man who feels the death of his daughter had something to do with Sonny Bonno.Robert Stack finds himself in a realistic situation. His superiors seem to find out more about certain parties AFTER an incident has taken place, but they can't seem to do it before an incident. This of course frustrates the Robert Stack character, but it offers us (the audience) some comic relief.Overall, it's a great movie with a nice normal start, meance, suspense, some badly needed comic relief, and a twist ending that I won't give away.One note worth mentioning is that Robert Stack finds himself in a situation that happens quite often. Often when you uncover a crime, there were other branches involved. But often one has to 'let the branches go' for the sake of dealing with the worst threat. Also to Robert Stack's credit is that his character knows that with his authority comes the responsibility to NOT ABUSE IT or play God with it. His character knows that his authority is for the sake of people's lives and well being.Overall, it's a great 70s horror movie as well as a nice tribute to the wonderful Farrah Fawcett who lived her life with dignity even when she had cancer.",5,Love Always Farrah,1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,2477,"['review', 'dedicated', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett.I', 'will', 'begin', 'saying', 'media', 'shoud', 'be', 'ASHAMED', 'virtually', 'ignoring', 'death', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'was', 'wonderful', 'human', 'being.That', 'said', 'great', '70s', 'horror', 'Everything', 'peaceful', 'nice', 'even', 'bit', 'comical', 'different', 'characters', 'board', 'flight', 'England.Within', 'few', 'minutes', 'smoke', 'bomb', 'uncovered', 'airport', 'later', 'see', 'possible', 'dangerous', 'consequences', 'person', 'only', 'meant', 'joke', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'be', 'hurt', 'too', 'scared', 'matter', 'However', 'airport', 'security', 'man', 'letter', 'was', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'find', 'next', 'day', 'letter', 'plotting', 'murder', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'plane', 'GREAT', 'SUSPENSE', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'major', 'kudos', 'pilot', 'who', 'must', 'keep', 'cool', 'flying', 'course', 'simultaneously', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'also', 'major', 'kudos', 'Stewardess', 'who', 'normal', 'duties', 'may', 'know', 'more', 'letting', 'to.It', 'hard', 'write', 'much', 'ruining', 'movie', 'have', 'several', 'suspects', 'have', 'doctor', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'who', 'been', 'threatened', 'man', 'flight', 'wife', 'died', 'Dr.', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'contacted', 'found', 'have', 'man', 'who', 'death', 'daughter', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Sonny', 'Bonno.Robert', 'Stack', 'realistic', 'situation', 'superiors', 'seem', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'certain', 'parties', 'AFTER', 'incident', 'taken', 'place', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'incident', 'course', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'character', 'audience', 'comic', 'relief.Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'nice', 'normal', 'start', 'meance', 'suspense', 'badly', 'needed', 'comic', 'relief', 'twist', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away.One', 'note', 'mentioning', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'situation', 'quite', 'often', 'Often', 'when', 'uncover', 'crime', 'were', 'other', 'branches', 'involved', 'often', 'one', ""'let"", 'branches', 'go', 'sake', 'dealing', 'worst', 'threat', 'Also', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'credit', 'character', 'authority', 'responsibility', 'NOT', 'ABUSE', 'IT', 'play', 'God', 'character', 'authority', 'sake', 'people', 'lives', 'well', 'being.Overall', 'great', '70s', 'horror', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'tribute', 'wonderful', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'dignity', 'even', 'when', 'had', 'cancer']",N/A

575695,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B00005A0QC,drkhimxz,"[1, 1]","I admit it. I clearly remember Robert Stack as the young man who walks out as Jack Benny begins his big scene as Hamlet,"" To Be or Not To Be"". He was going backstage to see Jack's  wife, Carole Lombard. It was a 1942 movie. Walter Pidgeon, was singing in the early 30's and playing Nick Carter in 1939,  then he was paired with Greer Garson and became a leading mature male star of the 1940's. Ralph Bellamy was Ellery Queen before he was FDR and a genuine star. Dane Clark, I saw in a stage show at the Strand Theater in NYC when he was still being groomed to be the next John Garfield but before the Black List and a series of films made in Italy. So, my judgment of this quite routine plot, threat of a murder on an airliner in a 1975 made for TV movie, cannot be what someone coming fresh to the film and the actors, Theodore Bikel, pushing 90, is still around, but not most of the others, will be seeing.So, if your film memory includes Leo Durocher's one time wife (and, you do not have to ask, who is Leo Durocher) and Sonny Bono means more than a one time husband of Cher, the renewal  of remembrances will lead you to enjoy this minor version of the very successful airliner films of the era.

This was your typical airplane movie where it took about 15 minutes or more to set up everybody roles that would occur on the flight 502. After the jumbo jet takes off Captain Larkin gets a radio call from security in New York City. First, a box was found in the first class section that security thought it was a bomb that turned out to be a smoking jack in the box. Next security finds a note in the lounge with an ominous message left by a passenger threatening to kill some of the passengers. At first, it is thought to be a sick joke, but soon a man posing as a priest and a flight attendant are killed. It is up to the captain to find the killer before the body count increases.

575702,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00005A0QC,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 2]","Of all aviation terror movies made in the 1970s, ""Murder on Flight 502"" is among the most preposterous. Don't get me wrong, it's plenty entertaining, but not necessarily in the way producer Aaron Spelling likely intended. I should open with the fact that I am an airline pilot, and as such I obviously can spot factual flaws in the film much like a professional mariner can see through the veneer of ""The Poseidon Adventure."" I will attempt to refrain from mentioning technical errors in the film (which are pretty much continuous) and instead dwell on the plot. The only exception is that I will mention that I laughed out loud when Robert Stack as Captain Larkin had to go to the flight deck to give the copilot (First Officer) instruction. This from a man who at one point leaves both pilot seats unoccupied during flight. We generally find that it's better to have someone flying the plane at all times.If you don't know (or care) about things aeronautical you will be at an advantage here. The film opens by introducing a cast of stars all populating first class (coach is never shown) in a 747 going from New York to London. The backstory and dialogue is humorously dated, while the stock footage and flight deck set are equally dismal. Suffice it to say that everyone is cast to play a stereotype, and that ""Airplane"" apes almost all of these roles perfectly. Where to start? Danny Bonaduce appears as Millard Kensington, a spoiled brat whose present to airport security serves as the opening volley for the ridiculous plot distractions. Next up is Sonny Bono as washed up pop star Jack Marshall. With guitar in hand he has an inauspicious reunion with a fellow passenger brandishing an extra-large serving fork. The highlight of the film was perhaps when Bono actually says to an admiring female passenger ""the beat goes on!"" (Groan.) I don't want to get into the details of the loopiest medical drama in any airplane movie, but will mention that Ralph Bellamy (""Trading Places"") was made for the role of Dr. Kenyon Walker. To sum up: there are more bumbling criminals and loony personality conflicts than most any other aviation film I can think of. And then there's Farrah Fawcett (as Farrah Fawcett-Majors) as lead flight attendant Karen White. She sure was beautiful and actually does a decent job with her role here. I won't spoil the dramatic conclusion, but will mention that Walter Pidgeon, Fernando Lamas, Brooke Adams (as the world's clumsiest flight attendant,) and Hugh O'Brian (as Detective Daniel Myerson) are all suspects in the dastardly dealings on Flight 502.What I learned from this movie: bullets can start a huge fire on an airplane, pop stars tote their guitars everywhere but when called to play them do so in a strangely unmusical way, murder mystery writers are very insightful and are helpful in solving real crimes, and customs is akin to a really good episode of ""The Dating Game.""This film is impossible for me to rate as it is clearly a contrived drama with a cast of thousands. It is representative of B-movie aviation melodramas of the day but while it's wholly unrealistic is still oddly entertaining and endearing: I settled on three stars, but it totally depends on your perspective and reason for watching it.The extras are just plain strange. They include biographies and filmographies of the actors. Well, that's only part of the story...for some reason only the careers of Bellamy, Bono, and Fawcett are featured. How odd that the rest of the cast (hello...Robert Stack) were not mentioned.If you're a fan of the murder mystery genre from the era or are an aviation movie completest, this is a good choice, just don't expect to be blown away with the logic or realism on display, although the likes of Theodore Bikel and Polly Bergen chewing the scenery more than makes up for it.",3,Ridiculous Subplots On A Plane,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,3827,"['aviation', 'terror', 'movies', 'made', '1970s', 'Murder', 'Flight', '502', 'most', 'preposterous', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'plenty', 'entertaining', 'not', 'necessarily', 'way', 'producer', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'likely', 'intended', 'should', 'open', 'fact', 'am', 'airline', 'pilot', 'such', 'obviously', 'can', 'spot', 'factual', 'flaws', 'film', 'much', 'professional', 'mariner', 'can', 'see', 'veneer', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'will', 'attempt', 'refrain', 'mentioning', 'technical', 'errors', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'continuous', 'instead', 'dwell', 'plot', 'only', 'exception', 'will', 'mention', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'Captain', 'Larkin', 'had', 'go', 'flight', 'deck', 'give', 'copilot', 'First', 'Officer', 'instruction', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'point', 'pilot', 'seats', 'unoccupied', 'flight', 'generally', 'find', 'better', 'have', 'someone', 'flying', 'plane', 'times.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'care', 'things', 'aeronautical', 'will', 'be', 'advantage', 'here', 'film', 'introducing', 'cast', 'stars', 'populating', 'first', 'class', 'coach', 'never', 'shown', '747', 'going', 'New', 'York', 'London', 'backstory', 'dialogue', 'humorously', 'dated', 'stock', 'footage', 'flight', 'deck', 'set', 'are', 'equally', 'dismal', 'Suffice', 'say', 'everyone', 'cast', 'play', 'stereotype', 'Airplane', 'almost', 'roles', 'perfectly', 'Where', 'start', 'Danny', 'Bonaduce', 'Millard', 'Kensington', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'present', 'airport', 'security', 'serves', 'opening', 'volley', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'distractions', 'Next', 'up', 'Sonny', 'Bono', 'washed', 'up', 'pop', 'star', 'Jack', 'Marshall', 'guitar', 'hand', 'inauspicious', 'reunion', 'fellow', 'passenger', 'brandishing', 'extra-large', 'serving', 'fork', 'highlight', 'film', 'was', 'perhaps', 'when', 'Bono', 'actually', 'admiring', 'female', 'passenger', 'beat', 'Groan', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'details', 'loopiest', 'medical', 'drama', 'airplane', 'movie', 'will', 'mention', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'Trading', 'Places', 'was', 'made', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Kenyon', 'Walker', 'sum', 'up', 'are', 'more', 'bumbling', 'criminals', 'loony', 'personality', 'conflicts', 'most', 'other', 'aviation', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'then', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett-Majors', 'lead', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Karen', 'White', 'sure', 'was', 'beautiful', 'actually', 'decent', 'job', 'role', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'will', 'mention', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'Fernando', 'Lamas', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'world', 'clumsiest', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Hugh', ""O'Brian"", 'Detective', 'Daniel', 'Myerson', 'are', 'suspects', 'dastardly', 'dealings', 'Flight', '502.What', 'learned', 'movie', 'bullets', 'can', 'start', 'huge', 'fire', 'airplane', 'pop', 'stars', 'tote', 'guitars', 'everywhere', 'when', 'called', 'play', 'do', 'so', 'strangely', 'unmusical', 'way', 'murder', 'mystery', 'writers', 'are', 'very', 'insightful', 'are', 'helpful', 'solving', 'real', 'crimes', 'customs', 'akin', 'really', 'good', 'episode', 'Dating', 'Game', 'film', 'impossible', 'rate', 'clearly', 'contrived', 'drama', 'cast', 'thousands', 'representative', 'B-movie', 'aviation', 'melodramas', 'day', 'wholly', 'unrealistic', 'still', 'oddly', 'entertaining', 'endearing', 'settled', 'three', 'stars', 'totally', 'perspective', 'reason', 'watching', 'it.The', 'extras', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'strange', 'include', 'biographies', 'filmographies', 'actors', 'Well', 'only', 'part', 'story', 'reason', 'only', 'careers', 'Bellamy', 'Bono', 'Fawcett', 'are', 'featured', 'How', 'odd', 'rest', 'cast', 'hello', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'were', 'not', 'mentioned.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'murder', 'mystery', 'genre', 'era', 'are', 'aviation', 'movie', 'completest', 'good', 'choice', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'logic', 'realism', 'display', 'likes', 'Theodore', 'Bikel', 'Polly', 'Bergen', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'more', 'up']",N/A
