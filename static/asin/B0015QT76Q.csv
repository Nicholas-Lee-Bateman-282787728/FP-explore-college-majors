1150517,A3FSYD0SS354NM,B0015QT76Q,"Darcy Shepard ""Darling Darcy""","[58, 62]","Season 7 has some of the classic episodes - ""Mega-Lo Dale"", ""The Miseducation of Bobby Hill"", and ""Night and Deity"", to name a few - fans have been waiting for on DVD for 2 years. The episodes are witty and focus on a variety of Arlen characters. With 22 solid episodes, this season is a must have for all King of the Hill fans.Some of the highlights include Bobby's foray into tarot card reading and spell casting in ""Witches of East Arlen."" One of my favorites from the entire seasons, the best part is Bobby's 30-ish friend Warren - he lives in his mom's basement, which he will continue doing for a few weeks after his mom's death, according to Hank.Another spectacular episode is ""Night and Deity"", which many remember as the one Nancy got her comeuppance in for cheating on Dale. When a new, very attractive exterminator comes in to help with the neighborhood's pigeon problem, she and Dale begin to work very closely together, much to Nancy's horror. One of the awesome things about this episode is you never know what will happen - will he cheat on Nancy?The most popular episode of the season is probably ""Mega-Lo Dale"" - Dale gets hired to get rid of Mega-Lo Mart's rat problem, but Hank has to step in when Dale becomes convinced the store has a baboon problem.One thing Fox may want to think about before it delays another season or another show - these episodes are readily available on the internet, and while many super-fans such as myself want the collection on DVD, many others are just as satisfied with the downloads as with the DVD, particularly when forced to wait 2 years later than its scheduled release.",5,The Much-Anticipated Spectacular Seventh Season,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,1627,"['Season', '7', 'classic', 'Mega-Lo', 'Dale', 'Miseducation', 'Bobby', 'Hill', 'Night', 'Deity', 'name', 'few', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'DVD', '2', 'years', 'episodes', 'are', 'witty', 'focus', 'variety', 'Arlen', 'characters', '22', 'solid', 'episodes', 'season', 'must', 'have', 'King', 'Hill', 'fans.Some', 'highlights', 'include', 'Bobby', 'foray', 'tarot', 'card', 'reading', 'spell', 'casting', 'Witches', 'East', 'Arlen', 'One', 'favorites', 'entire', 'seasons', 'best', 'part', 'Bobby', '30-ish', 'friend', 'Warren', 'mom', 'basement', 'will', 'continue', 'doing', 'few', 'weeks', 'mom', 'death', 'according', 'Hank.Another', 'spectacular', 'episode', 'Night', 'Deity', 'many', 'remember', 'one', 'Nancy', 'got', 'comeuppance', 'cheating', 'Dale', 'When', 'new', 'very', 'attractive', 'exterminator', 'help', 'neighborhood', 'pigeon', 'problem', 'Dale', 'begin', 'work', 'very', 'closely', 'together', 'much', 'Nancy', 'horror', 'One', 'awesome', 'things', 'episode', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'will', 'cheat', 'Nancy', 'most', 'popular', 'episode', 'season', 'probably', 'Mega-Lo', 'Dale', 'Dale', 'hired', 'get', 'rid', 'Mega-Lo', 'Mart', 'rat', 'problem', 'Hank', 'step', 'when', 'Dale', 'convinced', 'store', 'baboon', 'problem.One', 'thing', 'Fox', 'may', 'want', 'think', 'season', 'show', 'episodes', 'are', 'readily', 'available', 'internet', 'many', 'super-fans', 'such', 'want', 'collection', 'DVD', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'satisfied', 'downloads', 'DVD', 'particularly', 'when', 'forced', 'wait', '2', 'years', 'later', 'scheduled', 'release']",King of the Hill - Season 5

Surely there is a TON of money to be made off of the remaining seasons. So how far did the show get anyway, 12, 13 seasons? Really, releasing the other seasons should be a NO BRAINER. For one reason or another I find that I AM a Mike Judge Fan. I have the three collections of ""Beavis and Butthead"". I also have the MOVIE of B and B. And it's a shame to know that there was SO MUCH more Beavis and Butthead to be SEEN but it didn't get released because somebody realized some of the stuff was slightly controversial even EDGY. Wow, gotta keep the animation tame. So that is what we got with KOTH, TAME subject matter. Hank is surely a CONSERVATIVE. He is FAITHFUL to his wife and to his Dallas Cowboys, to Lady Propane, etc. So while I might have preferred more Beavis and Butthead Mike Judge moved on to a safer and more profitable family of animation. Some would think that Judge had been promoting beatings and ""Fire, Fire"", as Beavis said in some episodes.I have all six seasons of KOFTH and I am READY to buy more. I have B and B, what has been released. I am also a HUGE fan of the movie Idiocracy. I also LOVE ""Office Space"". Mike Judge has an insane imagination. It's a shame that I have to try to INFLUENCE corporate suits to release MORE Mike Judge inspired work.Just so you know I have a HUGE animation collection consisting of ALL of Southpark, all but the last two seasons of Family Guy, about 8 or more seasons of the Simpsons, Dilbert, Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Johnny Quest, Ren and Stimpy, The Oblongs, Pinky and the Brain and many more cartoon collections.
