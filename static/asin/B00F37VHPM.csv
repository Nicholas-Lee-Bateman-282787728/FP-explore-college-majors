1670047,AJOF6MLUKKLFZ,B00F37VHPM,Adam,"[1, 2]","I'm relatively new to the Doctor and have started at the beginning of the the new series and the classic series, so at this point, I'm unfamiliar with most of the characters as they are today, having only seen stories with the first and ninth doctors.The plot centers on the day the Doctor made the faithful decision to destroy all the Daleks and all the Time Lords to end a war that could destroy the universe. This never before seen &#34;war doctor&#34; ends up travelling back to Elizabethan England where he meets up with the tenth and eleventh doctors, the character's most recent regenerations.The Three Doctors and their main supporting characters are all likable and interesting. There are certain things that a newer fan to the series like me won't get (based on applause from the audience that I didn't understand a few times) , but I didn't HAVE to get it to understand the story. The show has a lot of humorous and clever moments. (My favorite being the door scene.) There's a lot of emotional moments and exciting ones. As a newer fan, I appreciated how Day of the Doctor treated the show's mythology and history in a way that made it interesting and engaging, something great to be explored, rather than an obstacle for new viewers to overcome. It was what a fiftieth anniversary of a still-hot property should be: It was grand and massive. It changed some of the Doctor's status quo but not in a way that undermine continuity.The only negative is that they resolution to the rubbery alien invasion subplot and its resolutions did seem a little contrived, particularly in the way it ended. Beyond that, this an epic 50th anniversary special for a beloved series.",5,Epic,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,1676,"[""'m"", 'relatively', 'new', 'Doctor', 'have', 'started', 'beginning', 'new', 'series', 'classic', 'series', 'so', 'point', ""'m"", 'unfamiliar', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'today', 'having', 'only', 'seen', 'stories', 'first', 'ninth', 'doctors.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'day', 'Doctor', 'made', 'faithful', 'decision', 'destroy', 'Daleks', 'Time', 'Lords', 'end', 'war', 'could', 'destroy', 'universe', 'never', 'seen', '34', 'war', 'doctor', '34', 'up', 'travelling', 'back', 'Elizabethan', 'England', 'where', 'up', 'tenth', 'eleventh', 'doctors', 'character', 'most', 'recent', 'regenerations.The', 'Three', 'Doctors', 'main', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'interesting', 'are', 'certain', 'things', 'newer', 'fan', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'based', 'applause', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'few', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'HAVE', 'get', 'understand', 'story', 'show', 'lot', 'humorous', 'clever', 'moments', 'favorite', 'being', 'door', 'scene', 'lot', 'emotional', 'moments', 'exciting', 'ones', 'newer', 'fan', 'appreciated', 'how', 'Day', 'Doctor', 'treated', 'show', 'mythology', 'history', 'way', 'made', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'something', 'great', 'be', 'explored', 'rather', 'obstacle', 'new', 'viewers', 'overcome', 'was', 'what', 'fiftieth', 'anniversary', 'still-hot', 'property', 'should', 'be', 'was', 'grand', 'massive', 'changed', 'Doctor', 'status', 'quo', 'not', 'way', 'undermine', 'only', 'negative', 'resolution', 'rubbery', 'alien', 'invasion', 'subplot', 'resolutions', 'did', 'seem', 'little', 'contrived', 'particularly', 'way', 'ended', 'Beyond', 'epic', '50th', 'anniversary', 'special', 'beloved', 'series']",Doctor Who
1670048,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B00F37VHPM,A. Gammill,"[2, 7]","Note: This review contains SPOILERS.As someone who discovered Doctor Who with the 2005 revival series, I have greatly enjoyed all 7 (so far) seasons and all 3 (again, so far) incarnations of the Doctor.  And I've slowly been working my way backwards in time to catch up with the ""classic"" era episodes on DVD.  I've bought plenty of books and collectibles as well.  I am a fan.So, like all fans, I was very excited about this highly-touted 50th anniversary episode, which sees, among other things, the return of 10th Doctor David Tennant.  And I will say right here and now that Tennant's interactions with 11th Doctor Matt Smith are among the best parts of the episode.  The episode has a very cinematic feel to it, and I regret not taking advantage of the opportunity to see it (in 3-D, no less) on the big screen.  It looks fantastic, and the main story is very engaging.On the downside, I was quite disappointed that Billie Piper was only playing a sort of Rose Tyler avatar, not the real character.  There is really no reason for her to be there (the character even admits she has appeared to the wrong Doctor, but never changes her appearance).  And although John Hurt is a fine actor and does his best with the material, I never really felt that his character was as dark as the 11th Doctor indicated at the end of the previous episode.And even with one delightful cameo, I still feel there were some missed opportunities here.  It IS a good story, and one that's important to the show's overall mythology.  But it needed to be bigger, with more guest stars.  It needed to be an EVENT, and I just feel it fell short of that ambition.Like I said, I'm a fan.  And I'll definitely be buying this.  I look forward to seeing it in 3-D.  And maybe I'll like it more the second time around. . .we'll see.UPDATE: I've just viewed the 3-D Blu-ray, and I am happy to raise my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  While I do stand by my comments above, watching the episode in 3-D really made for a much richer experience.  On the technical side, it's as good as any 3-D theatrical release I've viewed on my home screen.  The early scene with the TARDIS being lifted by helicopter over London is breathtaking, as are the panoramic views of old England with the 10th Doctor and Elizabeth I.  Since the show itself went to high definition in 2009, it has been among the most visually-striking programs in production.  ""The Day of the Doctor"" raises the bar even higher.The disc also contains a 13-minute ""making of"" featurette, narrated by 6th Doctor Colin Baker.  Make sure you watch the episode first, though, as the special does give away some major plot points.  There are also a handful of delete scenes (nothing earth-shaking), two trailers, and a nice overview of the series in general.  This last feature is basically another, longer (46 min.) episode of the ""Doctor Who Revisited"" series.If you have the equipment, and are a Doctor Who fan, this is absolute must-have.  More than anything, it really made me wish ALL future episodes of the show could be in 3-D.",5,"""Great men are forged in fire; it is the priviledge of lesser men to light the flame.""",1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,3054,"['Note', 'review', 'SPOILERS.As', 'someone', 'who', 'discovered', 'Doctor', 'Who', '2005', 'revival', 'series', 'have', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', '7', 'so', 'far', 'seasons', '3', 'again', 'far', 'incarnations', 'Doctor', ""'ve"", 'slowly', 'been', 'working', 'way', 'backwards', 'time', 'catch', 'up', 'classic', 'era', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'plenty', 'books', 'collectibles', 'as', 'well', 'am', 'fan.So', 'fans', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'highly-touted', '50th', 'anniversary', 'episode', 'other', 'things', 'return', '10th', 'Doctor', 'David', 'Tennant', 'will', 'say', 'right', 'here', 'now', 'Tennant', 'interactions', '11th', 'Doctor', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'are', 'best', 'parts', 'episode', 'episode', 'very', 'cinematic', 'feel', 'regret', 'not', 'taking', 'advantage', 'opportunity', 'see', '3-D', 'less', 'big', 'screen', 'fantastic', 'main', 'story', 'very', 'engaging.On', 'downside', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'was', 'only', 'playing', 'sort', 'Rose', 'Tyler', 'avatar', 'not', 'real', 'character', 'really', 'reason', 'be', 'there', 'character', 'even', 'appeared', 'wrong', 'Doctor', 'never', 'appearance', 'John', 'Hurt', 'fine', 'actor', 'best', 'material', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'character', 'was', 'as', 'dark', '11th', 'Doctor', 'indicated', 'end', 'previous', 'episode.And', 'even', 'one', 'delightful', 'cameo', 'still', 'feel', 'were', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'here', 'good', 'story', 'one', 'important', 'show', 'overall', 'mythology', 'needed', 'be', 'bigger', 'more', 'guest', 'stars', 'needed', 'be', 'EVENT', 'just', 'feel', 'fell', 'short', 'ambition.Like', 'said', ""'m"", 'fan', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'buying', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', '3-D.', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'like', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'around', '.we', ""'ll"", 'see.UPDATE', ""'ve"", 'just', 'viewed', '3-D', 'Blu-ray', 'am', 'happy', 'raise', 'rating', '4', '5', 'stars', 'do', 'stand', 'comments', 'watching', 'episode', '3-D', 'really', 'made', 'much', 'richer', 'experience', 'technical', 'side', 'as', 'good', '3-D', 'theatrical', 'release', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'home', 'screen', 'early', 'scene', 'TARDIS', 'being', 'lifted', 'helicopter', 'London', 'breathtaking', 'are', 'panoramic', 'views', 'old', 'England', '10th', 'Doctor', 'Elizabeth', 'show', 'went', 'high', 'definition', '2009', 'been', 'most', 'visually-striking', 'programs', 'production', 'Day', 'Doctor', 'bar', 'even', 'higher.The', 'disc', 'also', '13-minute', 'making', 'featurette', 'narrated', '6th', 'Doctor', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'Make', 'sure', 'watch', 'episode', 'first', 'though', 'special', 'give', 'away', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'also', 'handful', 'delete', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'earth-shaking', 'two', 'trailers', 'nice', 'overview', 'series', 'general', 'last', 'feature', 'basically', 'longer', '46', 'min', 'episode', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Revisited', 'series.If', 'have', 'equipment', 'are', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fan', 'absolute', 'must-have', 'More', 'anything', 'really', 'made', 'wish', 'future', 'episodes', 'show', 'could', 'be', '3-D']",Doctor Who

1670053,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B00F37VHPM,Allan M. Lees,"[9, 12]","Since the reboot of Doctor Who in 2005 with Christopher Ecclestone as the battle-scarred Doctor, the series has had some great moments and some wonderful actors. While the current lead writer/script wrangler Moffat may lack the sureness of touch possessed by the former lead writer Russell T Davis, he's undoubtedly been responsible for some of the best individual episodes. Now, however, comes the greatest challenge: writing a 50th Anniversary Special that will satisfy the fandom, enthrall new viewers, and somehow maintain continuity with all that has gone before.The bad news first: Ecclestone refused to participate in the making of this Anniversary Special, which meant that Moffat was forced to write around the absence of that particular Doctor. It also meant that Ecclestone's particular blend of menace and manic energy was unavailable - a great shame, as it would have made the moments with all three Doctors much more engaging and edgy. But it was not to be, for reasons best known only to Ecclestone himself. So Moffat had to create a hitherto unknown Doctor and the great John Hurt was slotted into the part. Without the context of prior appearances as the Doctor, however, this wasn't entirely satisfactory - yet what alternatives did the writer truly have? It's a bit like trying to arrange a Beatles reunion with only a couple of the original members.The good news is that the work-around solution does come close to working. The plot is quite clever (although internally inconsistent, but who cares?) and many of the old favorites emerge to please die-hard fans. Some will quibble with the appearance of a former companion in body but not spirit (despite the use of a well-known catch-phrase later on) and perhaps a more confident writer would have let the Tennant Doctor interact with his most beloved companion, but these are minor quibbles. The biggest single problem arises from the casting of Queen Elizabeth the First. This was a woman who overcame tremendous obstacles and ruled over a very unstable kingdom for many years. She should be a powerful, intense, yet vulnerable character. For some reason both the script editor and the casting supervisor felt it was a good idea to portray Elizabeth as a kind of mentally retarded overweight schoolgirl with all the gravitas of SpongeBob SquarePants. Fortunately the plot races along and we're spared too many embarrassments but... surely someone, at some point in the production, should have had the courage to point out the mistake? And then rectify it?Overall this was a competent effort and the use of references (in so many places) to former stories, characters, and props means that dedicated Whoovians will spend the next few days re-playing the episode to ensure that they spot every single one.The end of the tale also sets up the next Doctor for a new journey (always a useful plot device) and, in theory at least, the appearance of a much-loved Doctor as an aged Curator seems to imply that regeneration isn't necessarily The End for any particular Doctor. Perhaps a writer in future will use this opening to great creative effect - or perhaps it will go down in the annals of Whodom as a throw-away anachronism. Personally I'd use it for all it's worth, in tiny doses at precisely the right moments.In short, not as great as it could have been but very, very close. Let's hope the 60th Anniversary Special is even better!",4,Better than the fandom might have expected,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,3405,"['reboot', 'Doctor', 'Who', '2005', 'Christopher', 'Ecclestone', 'battle-scarred', 'Doctor', 'series', 'had', 'great', 'moments', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'current', 'lead', 'writer/script', 'Moffat', 'may', 'lack', 'sureness', 'touch', 'possessed', 'former', 'lead', 'writer', 'Russell', 'T', 'Davis', 'undoubtedly', 'been', 'responsible', 'best', 'individual', 'episodes', 'Now', 'however', 'greatest', 'challenge', 'writing', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'Special', 'will', 'satisfy', 'fandom', 'enthrall', 'new', 'viewers', 'somehow', 'maintain', 'continuity', 'gone', 'before.The', 'bad', 'news', 'first', 'Ecclestone', 'refused', 'participate', 'making', 'Anniversary', 'Special', 'meant', 'Moffat', 'was', 'forced', 'write', 'absence', 'particular', 'Doctor', 'also', 'meant', 'Ecclestone', 'particular', 'blend', 'menace', 'manic', 'energy', 'was', 'unavailable', 'great', 'shame', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'moments', 'three', 'Doctors', 'much', 'more', 'engaging', 'edgy', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'reasons', 'best', 'known', 'only', 'Ecclestone', 'So', 'Moffat', 'had', 'create', 'hitherto', 'unknown', 'Doctor', 'great', 'John', 'Hurt', 'was', 'slotted', 'part', 'context', 'prior', 'appearances', 'Doctor', 'however', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'satisfactory', 'yet', 'what', 'alternatives', 'did', 'writer', 'truly', 'have', 'bit', 'trying', 'arrange', 'Beatles', 'reunion', 'only', 'couple', 'original', 'members.The', 'good', 'news', 'work-around', 'solution', 'come', 'close', 'working', 'plot', 'quite', 'clever', 'internally', 'inconsistent', 'who', 'many', 'old', 'favorites', 'emerge', 'please', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'will', 'quibble', 'appearance', 'former', 'companion', 'body', 'not', 'spirit', 'use', 'well-known', 'catch-phrase', 'later', 'perhaps', 'more', 'confident', 'writer', 'would', 'have', 'let', 'Tennant', 'Doctor', 'interact', 'most', 'beloved', 'companion', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'biggest', 'single', 'problem', 'arises', 'casting', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'First', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'overcame', 'tremendous', 'obstacles', 'ruled', 'over', 'very', 'unstable', 'kingdom', 'many', 'years', 'should', 'be', 'powerful', 'intense', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'character', 'reason', 'script', 'editor', 'casting', 'supervisor', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'portray', 'Elizabeth', 'kind', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'overweight', 'schoolgirl', 'gravitas', 'SpongeBob', 'SquarePants', 'Fortunately', 'plot', 'races', 'along', ""'re"", 'spared', 'too', 'many', 'embarrassments', 'surely', 'someone', 'point', 'production', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'courage', 'point', 'out', 'mistake', 'then', 'rectify', 'was', 'competent', 'effort', 'use', 'references', 'so', 'many', 'places', 'former', 'stories', 'characters', 'props', 'dedicated', 'Whoovians', 'will', 'spend', 'next', 'few', 'days', 're-playing', 'episode', 'ensure', 'spot', 'single', 'one.The', 'end', 'tale', 'also', 'up', 'next', 'Doctor', 'new', 'journey', 'always', 'useful', 'plot', 'device', 'theory', 'least', 'appearance', 'much-loved', 'Doctor', 'aged', 'Curator', 'imply', 'regeneration', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'End', 'particular', 'Doctor', 'Perhaps', 'writer', 'future', 'will', 'use', 'opening', 'great', 'creative', 'effect', 'perhaps', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'annals', 'Whodom', 'throw-away', 'anachronism', 'Personally', ""'d"", 'use', 'worth', 'tiny', 'doses', 'precisely', 'right', 'moments.In', 'short', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'very', 'close', 'Let', 'hope', '60th', 'Anniversary', 'Special', 'even', 'better']",Doctor Who

Seems like years since I have seen Rose Tyler!But where is Christopher Eccleston? In July 2012, Christopher Eccleston spoke positively of his time on Doctor Who during a talk at the National Theatre. This led to speculation he was considering making a return appearance as the Ninth Doctor for the show's 50th anniversary in 2013. The current Doctor, Matt Smith, stated that he would love Eccleston to return but Eccleston declined for some reason after discussing with executive producer Steven Moffat to return to Doctor Who. And where is Captian Jack Harkness? played by John Barrowman.We want both Christopher Eccleston and Captain Jack, Back! :(BBC America has revealed the title and photo from &#34;Doctor Who's&#34; upcoming 50th anniversary episode, which will be called &#34;The Day of the Doctor.&#34; The photo shows the sideviews of both Matt Smith and David Tennant, the tenth doctor, with veteran star, John Hurt walking toward us from an explosion.Hoping they show a clip of all the actors who played Doctor Who and his companions for the last 50 years. I started watching as a kid on PBS Channel 9 back in the day, early 70's, with The Third Doctor Jon Pertwee who played him from 1970-1974.&#34;Doctor Who: Day of the Doctor&#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34; stars outgoing Doctor Matt Smith, predecessor David Tennant, Jenna Coleman, Billie Piper and John Hurt. The special marks the first time Tennant and Piper have appeared in the series since their farewells in 2010. According to BBC America, the special will be &#34;a celebration for long-time fans and an opportunity for those new to the series to jump onboard.&#34; But Clara Oswald the Doctor's new companion or Clara Oswin Oswald, otherwise known as the Impossible Girl as she keeps Popping up and coming back after death thru-out Time played by newcomer Jenna-Louise Coleman is still my most favorite companion for Doctor Who as she's the only one who can out-talk Doctor Who. The new Clara was &#34;more grounded and so far easier for the viewer to latch on to&#34; than her two predecessors, both of which could have been harder to sustain as companions and she has the potential to be &#34;a truly great companion&#34;, and that it was &#34;refreshing to see a companion who isn't in total awe of the Doctor... and she's not afraid to take the lead when she needs to. Moffat chose her for the role because she worked the best alongside Smith and could actually talk faster than him. Also Incarnations of herself are scattered throughout the Doctor's history, appearing to every known face of the Doctor and saving his life in numerous ways--for the most part unnoticed--and even ensuring that the First Doctor (William Hartnell) picks the right TARDIS on his home planet, prior to the events of the show's first episode.In a statement, Smith said: &#34;The Day of the Doctor is nearly here! Hope you all enjoy. There's lots more coming your way, as the countdown to the 50th begins now.&#34;Steven Moffat, lead writer and executive producer of &#34;Doctor Who&#34; said: &#34;50 years has turned 'Doctor Who' from a television show into a cultural landmark. Personally I can't wait to see what it becomes after a hundred.&#34;&#34;The Thick of It&#34; star &#34;Peter Capaldi&#34; will replace Smith in the titular role beginning with Season 8.Veteran Star &#34;John Hurt&#34; has revealed that his role in the 50th anniversary episode of TV's Doctor Who was one of the `toughest' challenges of his career.The actor, who will play an earlier reincarnation of the Time Lord in The Day Of The Doctor said, &#34;He had `given his life' over to the part so he could get to grips with the script's `quasi-scientific nonsense'.The 73-year-old star of the Alien, Elephant Man and the Harry Potter movies also dismissed a lot of modern television as `PAP' and said he was planning to cut back on his work commitments so he could spend more time indulging his passion for Painting.Hurt, who will star with Matt Smith and David Tennant in the episode, said: `It was one of the toughest parts I have had to learn, as difficult as anything I have done.`There is a lot of quasi-scientific nonsense which doesn't stay in your head that easily and that meant entire weekends spent on solid learning.`I remember Matt said I'd have to give my life over to it because there is a lot of learning and very little time to shoot.' I thought he was kidding.Hurt's unexpected debut as the &#34;War Doctor&#34; in the dying seconds of the last series caused a sensation when it was broadcast in May. Last week the BBC released an online mini-episode, which revealed that his character had regenerated from the Eighth Doctor, played by Paul McGann.&#34;The Zygons&#34; and &#34;The Daleks&#34; will also be featured in the special as the Enemies. It has been confirmed that &#34;paintings&#34; will be a plot point of the episode, and that the &#34;Time War&#34; will be explained.",4,"Great to see David Tennant, The Tenth Doctor & Billie Piper

I purposely discarded any expectations and let Steven Moffat's brilliant story take me where it wanted me to go. No spoilers here, but I do feel compelled to note one important aspect. Despite any statements or insistence to the contrary, it is very clear that if Christopher Eccleston had agreed to participate that it would have been the Ninth Doctor at the heart of the story, and that there would not have been a ""lost"" Doctor, whom the others tried to forget or repress in their memories. The Ninth Doctor would be filling the role that the ""War Doctor"" now fills. Exactly how that would have played out isn't so very difficult to imagine. Eccleston's loss is our gain, because if he had participated, we would not have John Hurt's brilliant incarnation of the Doctor that we now have to treasure. So, to apologize to anyone who reads this review in advance, I'll then say that Eccleston's no show was no loss to us, but his own loss and his alone (Goodbye Christopher Eccleston, and thanks for all the fish), and I for one, didn't miss him here. Provision was still made as to how he (Eccleston) remains in the canon; his story begins where this story ends, and his, the War Doctor and the Tenth Doctor will have no memory of what they had attempted to accomplish and whether they succeeded. This is both an incredible celebration of 50 years of Doctor Who and a launch into the next 50, made by people who love and cherish it every bit as much if not more than the fans.

1670090,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B00F37VHPM,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[2, 2]","Last month, the BBC series Doctor Who celebrated its 50th anniversary with the television special/movie The Day of the Doctor starring Matt Smith, David Tennant, Jenna Coleman, John Hurt and Billie Piper, which aired simultaneously in 94 countries across 6 continents and set a Guinness World Record for the largest simulcast of a television drama. The Doctor Who special broke rating records on Twitter and Tumblr, even causing more buzz than the Super Bowl and the MTV's Video Music Awards. Additionally, the special appeared on the big screen in 11 theatrical markets on the same night. BBC America and NCM Fathom Events presented the anniversary special in RealD 3D in over 660 select movie theaters across the country, becoming No. 2 at the box office on November 25th!Doctor Who: The Day Of The Doctor is arriving in stores tomorrow, December 10, 2013, on a two-disc Blu-ray 3D Combo Pack and a single-disc DVD, which is just in time for the holiday season.The bonus features included are:Doctor Who Explained - A 50-minute special covering the entire Doctor Who 50 year history.Behind the Scenes Featurette - Behind the scenes access of Doctor Who: The Day Of The Doctor, featuring interviews with the Matt Smith, Jenna Coleman, David Tennant, Billie Piper and John Hurt.San Diego Comic Con trailer of Doctor Who: The Day Of The DoctorDoctor Who 50th Anniversary Tribute Teaser TrailerTwo Mini-Episodes - ""The Last Day"" & ""The Night Of The DoctorThe Doctor had to jump into his own timeline to save Clara Oswald at the end of ""The Name Of The Doctor,"" resulting in the Doctor meeting another incarnation the viewers have never seen or heard about before, played by John Hurt. In The Day Of The Doctor, we finally get to see the great Time War that will destroy his home world, Gallifrey. During this era, he has done terrible things to stop the Dalek invasion and no longer deserves to be called the Doctor, but instead he is known as the Warrior or the War Doctor. To the stop the Dalek from destroying the universe, he steals the ancient weapon called ""The Moment,"" a galaxy eater, which would destroy both the Time Lords and the Dalek race, but the weapon has a conscience in the form of Rose Tyler/Bad Wolf. The Moment tries to show him another option than killing his own people and opens up a portal linking to the Elizabethan England and 2013.The 11th Doctor summons Clara Oswald, who just finished her first day of teaching, but almost as soon as she enters the TARDIS, they are forcefully taken by the UNIT, where the Doctor is given a letter written by his previous wife, Elizabeth I of England. She leaves a message stating he is now the curator of Under-Gallery, which happens to have a 3D Time Lord painting of the final day of the Time War. The paintings title is either No More or Gallifrey Falls.The 10th Doctor is in the Elizabethan England romancing Elizabeth I, as he believes she is really a Zygon and proposing marriage may be the only way to find out if she is one of the creatures, but it turns out he is completely wrong, except for the fact that the  Zygons are planning an invasion.The portal The Moment created brings the 11th, 10th and War Doctor together to stop the Zygons invasion through time and possibly prevent Gallifrey from being destroyed during the Time War.I missed out on the original airing, but I did get to watch Doctor Who: The Day Of The Doctor 3D Blu-ray over the weekend. With all the hype surrounding the 50th Anniversary Special, my expectations where mighty high, but I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed by the end result. Lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat did a wonderful job paying homage to the last fifty years and finally bridging the gap between the 8th and 9th Doctors. It's nice to have David Tennant returning one last time as the Doctor, which he blended in great with the 11th Doctor (Matt Smith). John Hurt does a wonderful work as the War Doctor. I actually thought he would play the villain in the special, but I was completely wrong. Being a fan of Billie Piper, I thought it was great to have her back, even though she wasn't playing Rose again. It would have been wonderful if Christopher Eccleston could have came back, but at least the producers added the 9th Doctor using archive footage along with the first eight Doctors. Speaking of the past Doctors, I enjoyed watching the mini-episode Night Of The Doctor with the return of Paul McGann as the 8th Doctor, but I do wish it was a bit longer. The back of the Blu-ray states the movie is 75 minutes, but the display time on my player had it at almost 80 minutes. There is a new Doctor Who documentary similar to the ones on the Doctors Revisited sets, but this one is 50 minutes. Overall, Doctor Who: The Day Of The Doctor is a great way to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the series. I enjoyed watching every minute of it and I'm looking forward to the new direction the series will have thanks to the clever ending.*Disclaimer - I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review and for the giveaway.

What a prospective buyer NEEDS is information on how good the episode is.This is not a terrible episode, but I have two major complaints about it.ONE:  Misuse of Billie Piper.  Advance information about &#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34; indicated that David Tennant (the Tenth Doctor) and Billie Piper (who played Rose Tyler, companion of the Tenth Doctor) would return.  Silly me!  I thought this meant the Tenth Doctor + Rose Tyler.  Rose Tyler was my favorite companion of the modern era and possibly my all-time favorite back to the early days of Doctor Who.  Well, David Tennant did come back as the Tenth Doctor, but Billie Piper played a completely different role, as a character who had never appeared on the show before.  What a bunch of baloney!  If they were not going to have Rose Tyler, they should have had somebody else play the role that Billie Piper played.TWO:  Too many annoying sub-plots.  The story has three interacting plot threads:  the end of the Time War between the Daleks and the Time Lords, interaction between the Tenth Doctor and Queen Elizabeth I (with interference from the Zygons), and interference from the Zygons in London in 2013.  The Time War has been hanging over the modern show like a storm cloud ever since the first episode of the modern series back in 2005, and the story should have focused on the Time War to the maximum extent practical.  The other stuff mostly constituted a distraction, although the interlude with Queen Elizabeth in around 1570 did tie up a minor loose end from The Shakespeare Code (the second episode of the third modern season).

1670114,A3K74JJXH3QAFS,B00F37VHPM,DPK,"[0, 0]","Based on his writing for television, one imagines that Steven Moffat's enjoys puzzles in whatever spare time his professional commitments allow. On the sitcom Coupling, Moffat showed a great affinity for making seemingly disparate pieces come together into a satisfying whole, often by playing around with time. Not surprisingly, this approach has been even more thoroughly explored in his writing for Doctor Who.Following his relatively straightforward first story* with the &#34;empty child&#34;, Moffat has taken the time travel aspect of the show and run with it like no other writer in Doctor Who's 50 year history. From his first script for David Tennant's Doctor to the overarching story-lines of his time as the show's lead writer, time has been a key element of the narrative puzzles he's assembled. This was true even of the 2007 mini-episode &#34;Time Crash&#34;, produced for the BBC's Children in Need charity event, which presented a brief meeting between David Tennant's Doctor and his 1980s predecessor, Peter Davison.In some ways that brief interlude was good practice for yesterday's special episode for the show's 50th anniversary, &#34;Day of the Doctor&#34;. Having the current Doctor meet his former selves was done to mark both the 10th and 20th anniversaries of the show and, despite the show not being on TV at the time, the 30th and 40th as well^. This precedent of celebrating the past in a way virtually no other show can added a particularly tricky piece to the puzzle, because while these stories had their moments none could be classified as one of Doctor Who's finest hours.After an uneven run of stories that culminated in &#34;The Name of the Doctor&#34;, I had my doubts as to how well Moffat would succeed at crafting a puzzle whose pieces included&#8230;-celebrating Doctor Who's past in a way longtime fans would appreciate but didn't require decades worth of background knowledge for everyone else to enjoy.-displaying the fun parts of multi-Doctor stories without succumbing to the pitfalls that made previous ones less than great.-fostering optimism about a 60th anniversary (and beyond).My doubts gave way to anticipation a little over a week before &#34;Day of the Doctor&#34; aired, thanks to one of two prequels that had been announced for the story. What made &#34;Night of the Doctor&#34; so good was not that it gave longtime fans like myself what we wanted, particularly a return appearance as the Doctor by Paul McGann, but rather that it did so in unexpected ways. In a little under seven minutes, Moffat managed to subvert our assumptions about some key elements of the show's mythology while also telling a sharply written story about gut-wrenching choices. It also helped explain how John Hurt as the mysterious &#34;War Doctor&#34; fits into the larger story.The idea of a missing incarnation seemed to annoy a lot of hardcore fans, especially when it was announced that none of the show's pre-2005 Doctors would be in the anniversary episode. Despite three of those actors being dead and none of the others except McGann and (to a lesser extent) Davison looking much like they did when they were the current Doctor, an awful lot of these &#34;fans&#34; prejudged the story as a disappointment solely based on Tennant being the only established past Doctor in it. This attitude is amusing in retrospect because it was having John Hurt as this newly revealed Doctor that made the multi-Doctor element work in a way that I can't envision any of Tennant's and Smith's predecessors doing.Because he represented a shadowy period in the Doctor's story before the one that started with Christopher Eccleston's Doctor in &#34;Rose&#34;, Hurt was able to embody the Doctor's entire past. On the one hand, his jabs at Tennant and Smith harkened back to William Hartnell putting his successors in line in &#34;The Three Doctors&#34;, but he also personified the tension between who the Doctor was, who he's become and who he should be. More to the point, having an actor of Hurt's calibre seemed to push Tennant and especially Smith out of their comfort zones. The end result is that a story that could have been a shallow and incoherent mess feels believable on a character level, which enabled me to enjoy the icing on the cake all the more.Admittedly, not all of the icing was to my taste. The war scenes on Gallifrey felt a bit too &#34;Star Wars&#34; for my liking, presumably intended to give more 3-D bang for the buck (or rather quid), but the return of the Zygons and seeing UNIT led by Kate Lethbridge-Stewart was great fun. Needless to say, it was also fantastic to see that the line about no pre-2005 Doctors appearing wasn't quite true either, and seeing a glimpse of incoming Doctor Peter Capaldi was a terrific touch.And then there's an element that's simply beyond objective assessment for a fan of my generation, Tom Baker.Baker declined to appear in the 20th anniversary story &#34;The Five Doctors&#34;, in which he was only seen in footage from &#34;Shada&#34;. Coming just two years after the end of his 7 year run as the Doctor, that decision wasn't surprising, though, Baker later said he regretted it and in recent years seems to have re-embraced Doctor Who. Seeing him as the museum curator who may or may not be another version of the Doctor may not have made total sense but here again on the level of character it worked, providing that elusive piece of the puzzle whose final form looks even cooler than you imagined.-----*Technically, Moffat's first script for Doctor Who was a 1999 charity sketch called &#34;The Curse of the Fatal Death&#34; starring Rowan Atkinson as the Doctor and Jonathan Pryce as the Master. Like all the best parodies, it also worked as a good example of the thing it was spoofing.^There a lot I could write quite a bit about both the 1993 Doctor Who/Eastenders crossover &#34;Dimensions in Time&#34; and the audio drama &#34;Zagreus&#34;, but I'll leave it at saying that both were done in good spirit but neither is especially good.",5,Not Perfect Though Still a Wonderful

This was Matt's last appearance as the Doctor and Peter Capaldi's first (Matt morphed into Capaldi). I have kept up with the transforming Doctor since Tom Baker. I do have several favorite &#34;Doctors&#34; in the series as well as favorite companions to the Doctor...especially Rose. I am glad the Doctor finally realized how much she really meant to him.

1670127,A1EAH69BFWEDHY,B00F37VHPM,Ferris Bueller,"[3, 6]","I have mixed feeling about The Day Of The Doctor. In many ways I love it and have already pre-ordered the Blu-ray even before I saw it in the cinema, and I thought the 3D aspect was very good. The best 3D I've seen since the Doctor Who Experience actually which was the best with the Pandorica and Daleks and Matt Smith's Doctor.I enjoyed TDOTD very much but I am a little sad at what could have been, I think Eccleson not doing it was a mistake. It's obvious that it was written with him in mind because Eccleson was the Doctor that was born in war and as wonderful an actor as John Hurt is of course Eccleson should have been there. It also messes up the order because by John Hurt playing an all new Doctor it pushes every Doctor after him forward so now 9 becomes 10, 10 becomes 11 and so forth....My other big complaint is Billie Piper, she is so overused and my least favorite companion in the new series. Besides that to be honest it would have made a LOT of more sense if Clara had been The Moment for John Hurt's Doctor instead of a Rose clone because after all we had just seen Clara enter The Doctor's time stream in The Name Of The Doctor and was able to be in all the places of his life from William Hartnell to Matt Smith. Excepting in these parts I consider TDOTD a success and wonderfully crafted story (note * when Matt Smith is in Trafalgar Square and the TARDIS door is left open we can see inside and the control room is not present but instead we see the inside of the prop! Whoops! Something I fully expect from the classic series but until TDOTD they never missed a beat and normally we would see the control room.)Seeing Tom Baker was a delight and having him come in as the curator to the museum was brilliant and a fantastic nod, 30 years late from appearing in The Five Doctors but at least we see him join this Anniversary Special...I think Eccleson made a huge mistake on this one but it is a joy to have John Hurt in it so as I said, mixed feelings on this all around but that won't stop me from enjoying it.If I had my way we would have had Chris Eccleson instead of John Hurt, a second Clara instead of Billie Piper, the TARDIS control room sliver fixed and Captain Jack Harkness show up!

1670135,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B00F37VHPM,Graves,"[2, 2]","How do you write an adventure to do justice to a program that first aired 50 years ago? Well if Day of the Doctor is your example you do so with respect for the series and affection for the characters and if you're very lucky, and in this we were, it comes off magnificently. Originally simulcast around the world at the exact 50th anniversary on the original episode aired in 1963 it became a global event.Starting off as just another adventure for the Doctor, a time traveling alien with a fondness for earth, when authorities believe they've discovered his ship, the TARDIS, abandoned and pick it up for him, literally, with a helicopter.  Since the Doctor is inside at the time and it was not 'lost' it leads to his comment ""would it kill you to knock next time?"" but arriving at the National Gallery we learn that there is a problem with paintings being smash and an ancient, alien painting that should never appear on earth.  All this seems like a normal adventure for fans as we learn it is tied to an adventure by the previous doctor in Elizabethan England and even more so to an older version of the Doctor, the version he's tried to forget, the version who killed everyone on his home world and all the Daleks, an evil cyborg race, in one moment.This older version has not had that moment yet, but it is painfully close and as the universe takes steps to try and prevent mass murder on a global scale, the three different versions of the Doctor come together to try and find another solution. David Tennant, the previous actor to play the Doctor and Matt smith, the current incumbent both play off each other well and both look with dread upon John Hurt as the earlier version of themselves who did the terrible act but all are the same man and can't help fighting and working together.All of this would have made a good adventure but the producers added in many, many `Easter eggs' for the long time fans to show their attention for the show's history. Just a few examples of this are that the Doctor's companion, Clara, is a teacher a Cole Hill School, where his first companions were teachers. When Tennant's doctor first see's Smith's Tardis he declares ""You've redecorated. I don't like it."" Mirroring  the conversation  between the 2nd and 3rd actors to play the Doctor in the shows 10th anniversary, likewise an alien general regularly frustrated by the doctor, on learning he is dealing with 3 Doctors declares ""I didn't know when I was well off"" echoing the same declaration and sentiment by the late Nicholas Courtney in his role of the brigadier in 1973.examples go on. They do not interfere with the adventure but rather are there to add to the experience of the viewer.In the end this is not for the person who's never watch an adventure of Doctor Who. This was and is for the fans. Sure the newbie can watch it and even enjoy it but they won't get a lot of the jokes. What this is, is a celebration of 50 years of a wonderful TV show. Sad and funny, tragic and triumphant all at once. When the dust settled it was what fans of the show hoped it would be. I wanted to say feared it wouldn't be but the Doctor and his Tardis is all about hope. And as is pointed out, the wheezing, groaning sound of the TARDIS arriving is a sound that brings hope and help to those in need who hear it, no matter Who they are!",5,Everything the fans could hope for to mark 50 years of wonder.,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,3331,"['How', 'do', 'write', 'adventure', 'do', 'justice', 'program', 'first', 'aired', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'Well', 'Day', 'Doctor', 'example', 'do', 'so', 'respect', 'series', 'affection', 'characters', ""'re"", 'very', 'lucky', 'were', 'off', 'magnificently', 'Originally', 'simulcast', 'world', 'exact', '50th', 'anniversary', 'original', 'episode', 'aired', '1963', 'became', 'global', 'event.Starting', 'off', 'as', 'just', 'adventure', 'Doctor', 'time', 'traveling', 'alien', 'fondness', 'earth', 'when', 'authorities', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'ship', 'TARDIS', 'abandoned', 'pick', 'up', 'literally', 'helicopter', 'Doctor', 'inside', 'time', 'was', 'not', ""'lost"", 'comment', 'would', 'kill', 'knock', 'next', 'time', 'arriving', 'National', 'Gallery', 'learn', 'problem', 'paintings', 'being', 'smash', 'ancient', 'alien', 'painting', 'should', 'never', 'appear', 'earth', 'normal', 'adventure', 'fans', 'learn', 'tied', 'adventure', 'previous', 'doctor', 'Elizabethan', 'England', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'older', 'version', 'Doctor', 'version', 'tried', 'forget', 'version', 'who', 'killed', 'everyone', 'home', 'world', 'Daleks', 'evil', 'cyborg', 'race', 'one', 'moment.This', 'older', 'version', 'not', 'had', 'moment', 'yet', 'painfully', 'close', 'universe', 'steps', 'try', 'prevent', 'mass', 'murder', 'global', 'scale', 'three', 'different', 'versions', 'Doctor', 'come', 'together', 'try', 'find', 'solution', 'David', 'Tennant', 'previous', 'actor', 'play', 'Doctor', 'Matt', 'smith', 'current', 'incumbent', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'well', 'look', 'dread', 'John', 'Hurt', 'earlier', 'version', 'who', 'did', 'terrible', 'act', 'are', 'same', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fighting', 'working', 'together.All', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'good', 'adventure', 'producers', 'added', 'many', 'many', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'show', 'attention', 'show', 'history', 'Just', 'few', 'examples', 'are', 'Doctor', 'companion', 'Clara', 'teacher', 'Cole', 'Hill', 'School', 'where', 'first', 'companions', 'were', 'teachers', 'When', 'Tennant', 'doctor', 'first', 'see', 'Smith', 'Tardis', ""'ve"", 'redecorated', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Mirroring', 'conversation', '2nd', '3rd', 'actors', 'play', 'Doctor', 'shows', '10th', 'anniversary', 'likewise', 'alien', 'general', 'regularly', 'frustrated', 'doctor', 'learning', 'dealing', '3', 'Doctors', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'was', 'well', 'echoing', 'same', 'declaration', 'sentiment', 'late', 'Nicholas', 'Courtney', 'role', 'brigadier', '1973.examples', 'go', 'do', 'not', 'interfere', 'adventure', 'rather', 'are', 'there', 'add', 'experience', 'viewer.In', 'end', 'not', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'watch', 'adventure', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'fans', 'Sure', 'newbie', 'can', 'watch', 'even', 'enjoy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'jokes', 'What', 'celebration', '50', 'years', 'wonderful', 'TV', 'show', 'Sad', 'funny', 'tragic', 'triumphant', 'once', 'When', 'dust', 'settled', 'was', 'what', 'fans', 'show', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'wanted', 'say', 'feared', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Doctor', 'Tardis', 'hope', 'pointed', 'out', 'wheezing', 'groaning', 'sound', 'TARDIS', 'arriving', 'sound', 'hope', 'help', 'need', 'who', 'hear', 'matter', 'Who', 'are']",Doctor Who

In the Gallifreyan city of Arcadia, all is lost.  But as the Daleks advance, chasing down each last soldier, they are met with a message shot out on a wall, ""NO MORE"".In the Gallifrey capital, the General is told there has been a breach of the Time Vaults, ""where all the forbidden weapons are hidden away.""  A Lord corrects him, ""They aren't forbidden any more. We've used them all against the Daleks.""General: ""No. No, we haven't. The Moment is come.... The Galaxy Eater. The final work of the ancients of Gallifrey. A weapon so powerful the operating system became sentient. According to legend, it developed a conscience. How do you use a weapon of mass destruction when it can stand in judgement of you? There is only one man who will even try.""In a Gallifrey desert of gold sand, an old man, his face etched with too much knowing, trudges with a sack over his shoulder. It is the Doctor (The War Doctor, we can call him #8 1/2?) and he's going to set off the Moment. But the weapon projects a reasoner, to make sure the Doctor understands the horrible deed he plans.The Doctor: ""I have no desire to survive this.""Reasoner: ""Then that's your punishment. If you do this. If you kill them all, then that's the consequence. You. Live....Do you want to see what it will turn you into? I'm opening windows to the future.""And suddenly we're in 1569 Elizabethan England, where the Tenth Doctor is romancing the Queen.At the same time, the Eleventh Doctor has been summoned by U.N.I.T. in 2013.And the fun begins, three Doctors together. This is an epic tale of great seriousness and loony comedy.  ""We're being attacked by shape-shifting aliens from outer space formerly disguised as my horse.""""You might say, I've been doing this all my lives.""There is only the briefest glimpse of the 12th Doctor,  We'll have to wait for the 2013 Christmas Special to meet him formally.Special Features:1.  Mini-Episodes. Two prequels to ""The Day of the Doctor"":.....A. ""The Last Day"" (4 minutes) A new soldier is outfitted for the important work of monitoring the space trenches over Arcadia. Check out every spot that appears in the sky, every bird, every shadow where there shouldn't be a shadow. And then, NO!, it's a shadow with an eye-stalk......B. ""The Night of the Doctor"" (7 minutes) The Eighth Doctor tries to rescue the pilot from a crashing spaceship. When she realizes he's a Time Lord, she is repulsed. ""Go back to your battlefield. You've not finished yet. Some of the universe is still standing.""He crashes with her, and is rescued by the Sisterhood of Karn (1st seen in ""The Brain of Morbius"" 1979).They offer him a forced regeneration. Pick what you become.2.  ""The Day of the Doctor: Behind the Scenes"" (15 minutes) This making-off featurette is narrated by Colin Baker, the 6th Doctor. He says, ""Steven [Moffat] really had his work cut out. Not only create a work that celebrates the past, but also takes Doctor Who into a brand new era.""  The next 50 years start here!3.  ""Doctor Who Explained"" (50 minutes) This has a long list of commentators, as befits a special explaining 50 years of Doctor Who: Matt Smith (11th Doctor), Steven Moffat (showrunner), Colin Baker, Tom Baker, Peter Davison (4th Doctor), Sylvester McCoy (7th Doctor), Neil Gaiman (writer ""Nightmare in Silver""), Marcus Wilson (producer), Julie Gardner (executive producer), Nicola Bryant (plays Peri), Jee Jee Tso (plays Chang Lee), Daphne Ashbrook (plays Grace Holloway), David Morrisey (plays Jackson Lake), Carole Ann Ford (plays Susan), William Russell (plays Ian), Freema Agyman (plays Martha), Mark Sheppard (plays Canton Delaware), John Barrowman (plays Captain Jack), Karen Gillan (plays Amy), Frazer Hines (plays Jamie), Mark Stickson (plays Vislor), Arthur Darvill (plays Rory), Jenna Coleman (plays Clara), Matthew Waterhouse (plays Adric), Hugh Bonneville (plays Captain Avery), Nocholas Briggs (voice of the Daleks), Noel Clarke (plays Mickey) and Sophie Aldred (plays Ace).Strickson: ""If I can imagine myself, I'm now a TV producer, going into an office and trying to sell Doctor Who. 'It's about this guy who travels around the universe in a telephone box and he has these ever-changing companions with him, and when he dies he comes back as another actor.'  Well, that's not going to work, is it? Because where's the loyalty for the audience?""This is a very basic introduction to the world of Doctor Who. As a fan who's collected the classic Doctor Who DVD's, I don't think there was anything new. But then, I don't think a long-time fan like me is who they are shooting for on this.4.  Comic Con Trailer for ""The Day of the Doctor"".""There's one life I've tried very hard to forget.""5.  Teaser Trailer for ""The Day of the Doctor"".At first I figured, well, the Season 8 story-arc must have, in the background, a search for Gallifrey.

I didn't care about the shows, I didn't care about The Daleks, The Cybermen, the Sonic Screwdriver, The TARDIS; none of it. In fact, I had made it a point, despite my other geek friends practically forcing me to watch, to almost actively be against DOCTOR WHO.In other words, I didn't want to like this. What's even worse is that I didn't want to LOVE it.And now I do.THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR will make you a fan of The Doctor, and this is part of the genius of Steven Moffat, as well as David Tennant, Matt Smith, Billie Piper, and John Hurt.It could have been so easy to screw this up, to have three Doctors in the same place at the same time, but Moffat has yet to do me wrong. Initially with his fantastic reimagining of the Jekyll/Hyde story with JEKYLL, then with his beyond awe-inspiring reimagining of the adventures of Holmes and Watson with SHERLOCK, and now... he's made me a DOCTOR WHO fan. Of course it doesn't hurt to have so many fantastic performers in one place either. I've been a fan of David Tennant without being a WHO fan, and who doesn't love John Hurt? This is literally my first exposure to Matt Smith, and I have to state that I am looking forward to getting to the 11th Doctor, because I've been binge-watching WHO starting with the 9th Doctor, Christopher Eccleston, and the introduction of Piper as Rose Tyler, and I've just recently finished Tennant's first season with ""Doomsday"" and that hit me right in the feels. I want to be finished by this year's Christmas episode.I know that this review makes me seem like I'm jumping on a bandwagon, and perhaps I am, despite my best intentions, but THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR is so marvelously entertaining, so charming, so smart and surprisingly dark at times, and having a better perspective on it now that I've seen some of the past episodes, it's just kind of miraculous. It's a shame that they couldn't get Eccleston, but his loss.So thank you again, Steven Moffat. You've made someone who never EVER wanted to be a fan of DOCTOR WHO now asking for Sonic Screwdrivers and a TARDIS for Christmas.I'm not quite down with the fezes or bow ties yet, though.

In retrospect I believe the purpose of this anniversary special was more of a celebration rather than The Best Doctor Who Episode Of All Time (as I said, I had high hopes!), which makes sense but was not, in my opinion, the special we were &#34;pitched&#34;. I understand why fans are pleased with the references and inside jokes, but I've got to align myself with those who admit that the special could have been much, much more.The introduction we were given to Hurt's Doctor at the end of The Name of the Doctor made me expect a very dark, emotional episode that was going to make me empathize with the Doctor, and understand why Hurt's Doctor is kept tucked away in the future Doctor's memory. But, the episode was surprisingly lighthearted - hearkening back to the &#34;celebratory&#34; purpose I mentioned earlier.The pacing was off, there were too many filler scenes, too much quick-fire dialogue so if you miss an explanation, you're lost . . . not enough character development for Hurt's Doctor, which is a pity since this is (apparently) the only time we'll accompany him on any adventures. There wasn't much focus in the episode - it felt very scattered . . . the subplot was necessary for ONE detail that links it to the main plot, and for such a small detail, that subplot took up way too much screen time. Ten didn't always feel like the usual Ten, from facial expressions to attitude. I thought there was going to be more emphasis on the &#34;war&#34; part of The Time War . . .The basic mechanics of the plot are clever, there's no denying that.

The comedic elements between the three doctors were really funny, and the movie gave us our first real interaction with the Time War, the horrible decision that was made, and the effect it had on everyday people. John Hurt did a great job playing the War Doctor and all the characters were played well, though Elizabeth was probably the weakest. Matt Smith and David Tennant worked well together and you could tell they really enjoyed what they were doing. The choice of the Zygons as the primary villain worked though I do wonder if they could have come up with something better or really used the Daleks more than they did in the anniversary.If I had to point to anything that didn't completely work for me I would say it was the Billie Piper Bad Wolf character from the show. I enjoyed seeing her again, but it was disappointing that there was never any interaction between her and David Tennant. The Rose/Doctor relationship was a big part of why the show was successful at the time. in the 50th she was just the face they used to play the artifact that was going to be used to end the Time War.I also had held out hope we would see more of the actual old doctors and not just CGI. The 50th anniversary is a big deal that all should be involved in. Most disappointing was no Christopher Eccleston, even if it was just to finish the regeneration sequence from the War Doctor to the 9th. The older doctors are involved in other 50th anniversary projects outside of this episode, which is good to see, but no matter how good Day of the Doctor was, it does bother me on some level that everyone wasn't in it, even if they had to play other characters.I had the privilege of watching this in 3D at the local theater, and I went really not being sure if I would be one of the only people going, when the reality was we packed that theater full of Doctor Who fans.

For a Dr. Who episode it was just okay, My 10 year-old girl loved it. Clara is a big hit with her generation. For me, a good Dr. Who episode has a well structured plot with a clever twist that revolves around some sort of interesting science fiction innovation that either expands a well known sci-fi concept or introduces a new one. But that is the &#34;old&#34; or &#34;original&#34; Dr. Who formula. We don't get much of that anymore. The latest series rely on visual and aural dramatics. The bad guys who are almost always daleks -- which inexplicably have not been upgraded from their aged and dated inverted Rubbermaid trashcan look.The soundtrack is a loop of the dramatic sounding Dr Who theme music that plays throughout the episode. In lieu of true suspense or drama; there are frequent battle scenes with innumerable narrow escapes; each more contrived and difficult to suspend disbelief than the last. And of course, there is heavy reliance on referencing past episodes including appearances by former characters.

(or ""homage"" if you wanna be a diplomat.) you can't, for instance, present your own ""apeman"" and not remind people of Tarzan. you can't present your own little old lady detective and not remind people of Miss Marple. you can't present your own hero serial killer and not remind people of Dexter. and you can't present your own unfettered wanderer through Time and Space without reminding people of a certain Timelord.and the Timelord in question shows no sign of winding down. nevermind the original 26 seasons, the 8 years the revived series has lasted could be several lifetimes in television years. so why isn't the concept runnin' out of steam yet? because it's unique recipe of heart, poignancy, and imagination is damn potent, that's why. take this example...the two most recent versions of Our Hero, nos. 10 (David Tennant) and 11 (Matt Smith), join the hitherto unseen incarnation who pressed the panic button to end the ""Time War"" and destroyed Gallifrey all those years (or centuries) ago, played by John Hurt. the decision was equal parts noble and ghastly, and together they grapple with it's ramifications. and as if their hands weren't full enough, there's also an attempted invasion of Earth to deal with, this time by the Zygons. (one wonders if that wasn't one of David Tennant's demands. he never got face them in his heyday, despite his having stated that they were his favorite alien species from the original series.)the aficianados will remember that previous such anniversary adventures had featured every Doctor up to that point, so this one's inability to do so may feel a little off. that can be good or bad: the 20th anniversary's ""The Five Doctors"" is somewhat uneven because they had to somehow accomodate so many of him, not to mention various sidekicks. on top of which, several bits of WHO effluvia - the Daleks, for instance - made utterfly illogical cameo appearances soley for the marquis value. (Tom Baker upset a few people by declining to appear, but ironically he ended up doing them a favor. his absence meant there was that much less convoluted intricacy for them to have to come up with.)whereas the 10th anniversary's ""The Three Doctors"" concentrated simply upon bringing together the three in question, and the result was a much more streamlined affair. a couple years after ""Five,"" ""The Two Doctors"" - in which the underrated Colin Baker meets the first great Doctor, Patrick Troughton - would further demonstrate that, for story's sake, you can multiply your Doctors only so far.and i'm happy to say that DAY OF THE DOCTOR follows the latter examples. the only major plor-related tip of the hat to the days of old is a Doctor's consciense character taking the form of Rose Tyler. it's handful of more incidental such salutes are mecifully discarded once they've served their purpose. (i do have to admit i was quite tickled by the ""round things"" moment.) i'm sure they were tempted to try to work in some wink at K9 or Torchwood or The Key To Time or his relationship with The Master, but wiser heads prevail. unlike John Nathan-Turner (producer a the time of ""The Five Doctors""), Steven Moffat understands that he can present either an adventure or a retrospective. however neat-o the idea of both at once might seem, the result can't help but be a cumbersome mess. (especially when one considers how much The Doctor's world has developed since it's 20th year.)and of course we can't overlook the nifty cameo appearance by one Tom Baker. whether it's enough to compensate for his absence from ""The Five Doctors"" is for anyone to surmise. i think so, if only because it serves the story.in short, what we have here is an engaging and unpredictable ride which more than demonstrates why The Doctor has (to borrow a phrase from one of his spiritual bretherin) lived long and prospered. and why he will continue to do so for a few more years (or should i say centuries) at least.[NOTE: i do hope i don't seem to be dissing ""The Five Doctors"" too severely. it's not the most tightly structured exercise in storytelling ever attempted, but it's not without it's charms either. it's just not one of my top 100 (or however many) episodes, that's all.]",5,Five Decades An' Still Warpin',1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,4441,"['blue', 'moon', 'so', 'character',

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","When the initial buzz over &#34;The Day of The Doctor&#34; started, this old Whovian had moments of pure joy and moments of great fear.  Would Moffat and company dash the rich history of classic Who on the rocks in order to appease new Whovians and hipsters who only watch the  show because they find one of the Doctors attractive?  Or would he actually pay homage to the men who have portrayed this brilliant character before Matt Smith and David Tennant?  I'm happy to admit that Moffat and the gang at the BBC did a brilliant job of blending the two together to give old fans, new fans, and wannabes a happy compromise.Without giving anything away, &#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34; is brilliant.  Smith, who in my opinion is the best of the new Doctors, is in top form here.  He's a bit silly, a bit oafish, and very centered.  Tennant, another fine Doctor, brings his combination of smugness, pop-culture referenced, brooding attitude to the show and doesn't skip a beat when he slides back into his old trainers.  Billie Piper also returns, but not necessarily as Rose.  Jenna-Louise Coleman tags along as Clara, and proves to be the grounding point for all three of the Doctors in this episode.  Wait?  Did I just say, &#34;three?&#34;  Absolutely.  John Hurt appears as the &#34;War Doctor,&#34; who did something so vile that #9-11 have done all they can to blot his actions and his existence out of their minds.  He is the Doctor that does what must be done, and this episode focuses on his moral dilemma.The entire episode plays out brilliantly.  It has just enough of everything in it, from comedy to fear and suspense to silliness.  For older fans like myself, there's also some wonderful nods to the past, and I dare not say another word about them in case I spoil the show for anyone.  Just know that by the end of the tale, you'll be smiling from ear to ear, or crying, or both.I love the renewed interest that has hit Doctor Who.  I love the energy of the young fans and the happiness that fills many of the old fans' hearts.  As with any franchise, there are those who hop on the bandwagon only to bail once the newest thing comes along.  They'll be gone soon enough.

1670174,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B00F37VHPM,K.T. May,"[2, 5]","So, what&#8217;d you think?The overwhelming response to the 50th Anniversary special of Doctor Who, which aired this past Saturday (as the largest global simulcast in television history) is that Whovians were generally pleased.  They enjoyed the 180-degree turn the Whoniverse has taken away from the darkness of the past that we had gotten used to and toward what is potentially a more optimistic and hopeful future.This turn of events (Gallifrey being frozen in time somewhere in space and not, in fact, destroyed by the Doctor in the Time War) now sets the stage for some interesting story arcs, as well as for the plot holes and continuity errors that are just waiting to be discovered by devout Whovians.One thing the 50th did for sure was live up to its hype, particularly when it came to bringing back the beloved Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, and having him interact with the current and Eleventh Doctor, Matt Smith.  Simply put, the two went together like peas and carrots (or fish sticks and custard).Seeing Tennant again made us realize just how much we had missed him (even if they did make him inexplicably dafter here), and seeing Smith in his first new episode since the announcement of his departure in the upcoming Christmas special (set to air on December 25, 2013) made us love him even more and miss him like he&#8217;s already gone.John Hurt&#8217;s War Doctor teasing the both of them felt very &#8220;you kids should get off my lawn!&#8221;  Imagine finding out that you actually get less mature as you get older &#8211; you&#8217;d probably get irked at your selves, too!  We were all prepared to despise this man, and yet he was, in the end, just as lovable as every other Doctor.Thankfully, the writers had Billie Piper portray the Bad Wolf version of her character, as opposed to the Doctor&#8217;s former companion/lady love, Rose Tyler.  Rose would have distracted us too much from the main storyline.  Plus, we now can understand how the Ninth Doctor, Christopher Eccleston, found the Bad Wolf he was subconsciously (?) searching for, and that it may not have actually been pure happenstance.Surely many of us were still disappointed, though, that Piper and Tennant did not interact at all whatsoever during the 50th, so we&#8217;ll have to settle for how happy they must have been behind the scenes to see each other on set once again.Seeing Tom Baker was a warm and pleasant experience, even for those of us who were too young to have seen his performance as the Fourth Doctor when it originally aired, and the fact that Clara&#8217;s presence was kept to a minimum was a relief indeed and further proof that Clara is less of a companion and more of a plot device, something of which the 50th was certainly in no need.How epic was soon-to-be Thirteenth Doctor Peter Capaldi&#8217;s cameo?  The fact that they included him in the 50th when he&#8217;s not even the Doctor yet (as well as how they never leave Eccleston out, despite any bad blood that may exist between him and the crew) lends credence to the respectability of this show.Though, even knowing that Eccleston would never return, we were all still hoping he&#8217;d show up in that regeneration scene, just for a brief second.  At least he was there in CGI spirit and, for that, we can be appreciative.And now for the less impressive elements of the special.  First of all, the poor Zygons - they really served no other purpose than as a nostalgic throwback.  It seemed that the subplot (which, let&#8217;s face it, none of us were paying attention to anyway [and since when does Who have a subplot?]) was simply a way through which the writers could channel their nostalgic homages, like River Song&#8217;s shoes or Baker&#8217;s scarf.The fact that the War Doctor was likeable by the end of the episode is unsettling.  Simply put, for the War Doctor to be likeable, he has then risen to the same level on which we place all the other Doctors which, in turn, makes him the true Ninth Doctor.  At first, this may seem like it craps on Eccleston&#8217;s run, but all it really does is mess with the numbers (Nine is now Ten, Ten is now Eleven, and so on &#8211; and we all know that Tennant has to stay &#8220;Ten&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s in his name, after all!).However, thanks to the spoiler that was released today with regard to the upcoming Christmas special, apparently Matt Smith is the Thirteenth and Final Doctor.  What?!  So then they really have been following the numbers rule all along, even if Whovians were the last to know.  But now that Gallifrey has not, in fact, fallen, it&#8217;s more than possible that the Time Lords will grant the Doctor more regenerations, something that seemed less likely before &#8211; perhaps as a thank-you for saving the planet?Two things the creators of Doctor Who manage to do time and time again is to talk themselves out of corners that they had painted themselves into, and to move us to unmatched levels of emotion.  The 50th anniversary special certainly accomplished that, and much more, culminating with its final shot.Now, we can prepare ourselves to weep on Christmas as we say goodbye to Matt Smith.  But hey, we&#8217;re also saying hello to Peter Capaldi &#8211; a Doctor who may not be as dark now as we may have been initially led to believe.

It was called &#8220;Doctor Who&#8221;. The ambiguous title along with a very eccentric, ambiguous, cantankerous, old, young, funny, witty, gadget orientated, sportsman-like, tall, short, blonde, brunette, dark haired, white haired skinny, chunky straight-haired curly-haired&#8230;.main character otherwise known as &#8216;The Doctor&#8217;, has traveled through time and space for last 50 years in an original Police Box of the late 50&#8217;s and early 60&#8217;s. These Police boxes were commonly seen around the streets of England way yonder when. Why a Police Box? The T.A.R.D.I.S. (the Doctors time machine which is an acronym for &#8220;Time And Relative Dimensions In Space&#8217;) broke its chameleon circuit which is designed to shape the TARDIS into the background environment wherever it goes so as not to be seen or distracting. (But, then was fixed only to be set back again to the Police Box setting by the Doctor himself &#8211; for &#8216;sentimental reasons&#8217; he says.)This year, on November 23rd, 2013 (in America on the 25th) &#8211; 50 years to the day - a worldwide event occurred both on the small screen and the large (silver) screens in Global Geo Sync for the first time ever. &#8216;The Day of the Doctor&#8217; was first presented with a wonderful behind the scenes  treat for the fans before the screening itself and an intro that introduces the audiences to 3D! A &#8220;Doctor Who&#8221; first! In 660 theatres across the US, $4.77 million was made for one night for one showing. Detailing precise arrangements through the BBC with Fathom Events, that translates to $7,155 per location and over 320,000 tickets sold making this Fathom&#8217;s biggest and most successful synced event ever! In every theatre, wherever &#8216;The Day of the Doctor&#8217; was playing, it was the number 2 box office gross on that particular Monday night showing nationwide.Now in the Guinness Book of World Records, &#8220;Doctor Who&#8221; is already been noted as the longest running Science Fiction Television show in history, it has now received another Guinness award for being the most watch single episode of any TV show event worldwide &#8211; ever! Beating all the viewers of the broadcasts of The Academy Awards and the Superbowl yearly! For 75 minutes, on TV, in the UK alone 10.2 million viewers watch &#8216;The Day of the Doctor&#8217; at the same time as the rest of the world did (add another 5.2 million viewers for the second showing during primetime that evening making it 15.4 million viewers). On Twitter it broke the most Tweets ever over a period of time during its actual first run airing, it became GetGlue&#8217;s most downloaded show on ITunes for BBC America within 24 hours of its release beating the former record holder, the &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; finale and finally setting a new record on Tumbler for the highest level of activity for any televised event in Tumbler&#8217;s history!Enough with the stats&#8230;why you should watch the show (or get the Blu-Ray version, also available in 3D on December 10th, 2013), simple; It&#8217;s simply the best, up-to-date action, adventure, shocking, surprising, plot-twisting, villain filled, humorous, whirlwind of a roller-coaster ride of exciting Science Fiction story telling you&#8217;ll ever see.SPOILERS (If you have seen it &#8211; stop reading here and go to the last paragraph):Technically Director Nick Hurran (Sherlock, Me and Mrs. Jones) did an amazing job of taking a Steven Moffat (Sherlock, Tin Tin) script filled with plot twist, time anomalies, aliens, companions and three (actually 4) Doctors of the past, present and yes, future, and making the entire mini-movie (episode) exciting and funny and just pure heartwarming fun all in 75 minutes!Speaking of the cast&#8230;.Matt Smith is our 11th (or 12th) Doctor and currently needing the assistant of two of his other selves. Doctors # 9 (Hurt) and Doctor #10 (or 11th who is Tennant). Matt has taken on the role and over his four year run has become adored by fans. His quirky, over the top and broad theatrical skills have cemented him as a fan favorite. With only one more episode to go, his four run is almost at an end and in this episode the actor has publicly proclaimed he was delighted and thrilled to work both with Tennant (his predecessor) and John Hurt. Matt is colorful and serious and above all fun with all his adventures and his comic keen timing with both Hurt and Tennant is spot-on!Fan favorite Doctor and brilliant actor David Tennant (Hamlet, Harry Potter) returns as his personification of the 10th (11th) Doctor who must join forces and collaborate with himself, the 9th and the 11th (12th) Doctor to save Gallifrey once again because &#8216;The Great Time War&#8217; between the Daleks and the Timelords has not occurred. But, yes it has. Confused? You won&#8217;t be, it&#8217;s exposition at its best. And it&#8217;s all done with relatively real logic and a lot of humor. Having been the favorite of the newly rebooted &#8220;Doctor Who&#8221; for four years prior, it was like watching David slip into a comfortable pair of old slippers. His performance was sharp and witty as well as brining back his &#8216;Tennantisms&#8217; of fast dialogue and third person repartee with no one there. Just pure fun!John Hurt (The Elephant Man, Alien) is the 9th Doctor (In between Paul McGann and Christopher Eccleston but everyone past him up one &#8211; go figure!). John is a superb actor and there&#8217;s no arguing that, but this role he just seemed to delight in. I&#8217;ve never seen him more happy, perky and downright funny. That&#8217;s what he made of his character who was obviously playing that he was &#8216;not that impressed&#8217; with his future incarnations (i.e. Smith and Tennant) extremely well. John was wise and regretful but with a twinkle of wonderment making the three of them like a nuclear bomb of talent and excitement!Jenna Coleman (Captain America, Death Comes to Pemberly) is riding on as the current companion known as Clara or the &#8216;Impossible Girl&#8217;, and Jenna has the best job of all, even with her wonderful modern-day kick and attitude of how a real person today might react to the personalities that are The Doctor, she gets to play tennis with three of the most diversely different performers you could think of. And showing her acting chops, Jenna is a pro tennis player bouncing and providing the exact response each Doctor needs. Bravo Jenna.Billie Piper (Foxtrot, Penny Dreadful) is back and she looks a lot like Rose Tyler but calls herself &#8216;The Moment&#8217;. Yet another talent, Billie a former pop star turned actress, thanks to Eccleston/Tennant mostly, she gets to play a wildly bizarre character with voice inflections and a Yoda-like wisdom while still bearing the cute charm of what was once the first companion in the Doctor&#8217;s reboot back in 2005. Billie must have had a ball doing this and when you watch it again, watch her eyes. So cool!Jemma Redgrave (Howards End, Unforgiven) is back as Kate Stewart, the Brigadier Stewart&#8217;s daughter who only heard stories of her father talking about the many incarnations he has seen of the Doctor over the past decades. Jemma is fun and what better than to play a duel role. That of a bad guy (a Zygon) and that of a good guy (head of UNIT). Again another actress who plays like a pro and gets to bounce two personalities she is playing with three amazing actors. (Remember? Matt Smith, David Tennant and John Hurt!)Joanna Page (Love Actually, From Hell) plays Elizabeth the 1st with lots of heightened energy, but the only down side for me is she played it more modern and I would expect an 18th century Queen to be more regal and stern. Joanna is obviously having so much fun because most of her scenes are with Tennant.BIG SPOILER &#8211; DON&#8217;T LOOK! &#8211; DANGER &#8211; DANGER! : Tom Baker (The Golden Voyage of Sinbad, Little Britain) is in this production. For those of you just joining the planet, Tom is playing &#8216;The Curator&#8217; (Or is it really Doctor #4). Yes the oldest living Doctor of the thirteen actors who have played the title character makes a wonderful, heartwarming, charming and funny last appearance. Back in the 70&#8217;s Tom was the most popular Doctor for having had the role for the longest which was for 8 years! He and Matt performed magic together with their unique twinkles in their eyes and an almost tear-jerking smile between the two of them. It was a cherry on top of a big delicious cake. Yum! Seconds please!Again, the Doctor or Matt Smith will return for his final performance in the Christmas Special which always airs on Christmas Day worldwide we&#8217;ll see the end of yet another Doctor (era) and start the legacy of another.  &#8220;The Time Of The Doctor&#8221; will introduce us to Peter Capaldi as the new 12th (or 13th) Doctor on Christmas Day! A sneak preview for the episode was shown after the simulcast of &#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34;, confirming the appearance of the Cybermen and revealing the inclusion of the Silence, Daleks, and Weeping Angels, as well as confirming the Doctor's return to the planet Trenzalore. Don&#8217;t miss it!Oh and the best shot is when Matt Smith walks out of the TARDIS with a wonderful voice over narration and we see all 13 Doctors! Now on DVD/Blue Ray this episode &#8220;The Day of the Doctor&#8221; has already gone down in history and if you have never seen &#8220;Doctor Who&#8221; and you want to see what this 50 year old legacy &#8216;tastes&#8217; like, buy this episode. Yes buy it, don&#8217;t just watch it, it&#8217;s that good!",5,&#8220;50th Anniversary Episode of Doctor Who Is TRULY &#8216;The Day of the Doctor&#8217;&#8221;,1386806400,"12 12,

We finally learned the truth about the time war and the terrible choice that haunted the doctor for so long. John Hurt was brilliant in the role of that earlier regeneration, his ""older"" and darker self. Tennant, Smith and Hurt were fantastic together, and bringing Billy Piper back as a manifestation of the sentient weapon intended to end the time war was perfect. The story tied up some loose ends and explained an inconsistency in ""The End of Time"" that had bothered me. It also opened a whole universe of opportunities for the future of the show.Oh, and it was great fun! I watched the television simulcast on November 23rd and saw it in the theater on November 25th.

1670184,A2ZRCNY3FVR4AI,B00F37VHPM,"Lucas Goldstein ""Luke Goldstein""","[2, 2]","Very few shows in history ever make it to a fifty year anniversary, in fact, according to the folks at the Guinness Book of World Records, the sci-fi genre has seen exactly zero shows last that long. Something like that deserves to be appropriately celebrated and the BBC and the Doctor Who crew pulled out all the stops when they crafted the worldwide simulcast of 'The Day of the Doctor'. Sadly there were some unlucky fans who didn't have access to watch it live on television and couldn't make it out to the theater to see it broadcast on the big screen either, but no worries now because they immediately put the special extended episode out on DVD along with bonus features to add to their growing collections.'The Day of the Doctor' brings the two most recent Doctors (Matt Smith and David Tennant) together on screen along with a mysterious third Doctor, known as the War Doctor (played by John Hurt.) As the story unfolds we find out why this long forgotten version of our hero has been buried in his memories, in his guilt and in his shame. All three Doctors have to learn to trust each other (or themselves, you could say) in order to set right something that went wrong so long ago.From the moment the show begins every fan is just waiting for one thing, to see Smith and Tennant on screen together for the first time. How will they react? How will they play off each other? Will it be funny, awkward or just plain silly? I'm happy to say I thought it was exceedingly charming not only how those two worked together, but how they in turn played off Hurt as their older/younger version. In terms of plot and story structure the episode works well at the start, but I felt the ending left something to be desired. It rang a little to reminiscent to me of the same tactic used in the legendary episode 'Blink'. Yet, I won't go into that too much more since folks might not have watched this yet. I'll just leave it with this; anytime you are writing a story dealing with time travel and paradoxes, there are about as many possible endings as their are audience members. There's just no way to please them all.The DVD release has a few neat bonus features for the die-hard fans. There are two mini-films which cover a couple of outside plot points which lead into the anniversary episode. One features the beginning of the final attack on the Doctor's home planet, while the other film features a former Doctor, Paul McGann, and details his transformation into the War Doctor. There is also a behind-the-scene featurette about the making of the episode, where you get to see and feel the real camaraderie between everyone, both in front of the camera and behind. It's not just a nicety passed on without thought when actors from this franchise talk about it being like a family that just keeps growing. Once you're into Doctor Who, no matter how long your character lasts, you are part of the history of it forever.There's also a primer, kind of a documentary tracing the show all the way back to it's humble beginnings.

This is 3D that the movie theaters use.I deeply appreciate the thought that the producers and director put into each shot of this marvelous show. The 3D is exceptional. Most scenes look like the viewer is standing on the side of the set watching the actors. There is very little gimmickry to the show. Some scenes, like the fields and forrest in the Queen Elizabeth scene are majestic and so natural looking. Very little contrast or brightness is lost in the 3D viewing.After seeing the 50th Anniversary Special in 3D I was hoping that the extras would be in 3D as well. Alas, this was not to be. They are in 2D and crystal clear in the Blu-ray disc.There was a surprise pack of Trading Cards included. Each card has a drawing and history of each Doctor, the Doctor years on TV and a bonus card for John Hurt.Seeing David Tennant one more time was the topper for me. He was 'my Doctor'.

Yet there are so many inside references that the newbie will actually lose out on the nuances I think.I don't want to give away anything but I have to say that the most exciting prospect for the future of the series is that we will get to see Gallifrey portrayed the way it was meant to be! This has been the one thing I found lacking since the 2004 reboot - the boorish menace of the High Council who might at any time force the Doctor to do their dirty-work for them.As for the episode itself, it really is a true celebration of 50 years of TARDIS travel. Even the idea of the Doctor meeting his former selves is a callback - especially David Tennant delivering the line &#34;Oh, I see you've redecorated ... I don't like it.&#34; in exactly the same way as Patrick Troughton did in &#34;The Three Doctors&#34; in 1972-73. Maybe the best moment of the entire episode is the meeting of Matt Smith (the current Doctor) and Tom Baker (the oldest living previous Doctor). One thing which I think will make all Whovians happy is that it has been all but declared that the old rule that Time Lords can only regenerate 13 times has essentially been overturned. It seems that as long as there is an audience for the show and people who love it working at the BBC to produce it, there will continue to be many new episodes of &#34;Doctor Who&#34;!SPOILER ALERT!!! If you have not yet seen the episode and don't want to know any more, stop reading here!!!The story itself clears up at least one huge mystery which has been plaguing fans both new and old - what exactly did the Doctor do to end the Last Time War? In some stories it seemed as if he burned Gallifrey to cinders but in others Gallifrey is described as being simply lost. And in &#34;The End Of Time&#34; the Time Lords actually did try to return. We now know (or at least I strongly suspect) that Moffat and Davies have been playing a long-game and have been working towards exactly this moment all along. Essentially, the Doctor used a weapon which had a conscience and could actually speak to him. Appearing in the form of Rose Tyler, whom this incarnation of the Doctor had not yet met, and calling itself Bad Wolf (see Season 1 of the new series) it decided that his punishment would be to survive the devastation. In allowing him to live, he then has time to think about the consequences and live with them - and maybe even change them! In the end, when Matt Smith is confronted by Tom Baker, he's told not only that he will have many many more incarnations - some even returning to old models in different apparent age-stages - but that Gallifrey is out there for him to find, if he wants to do so.",5,A Fitting Celebration For Whovians New And Old - but not recommended for complete newbies,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",2013,2851,"['review', 'content', 'actual', 'episode', 'DVD', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'released.This', 'episode', 'fantastic', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'fans', 'new', 'old', 'series', 'equally', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'inside', 'references', 'newbie', 'will', 'actually', 'lose', 'out', 'nuances', 'think.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'anything', 'have', 'say', 'most', 'exciting', 'prospect', 'future', 'series', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'Gallifrey', 'portrayed', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'been', 'one', 'thing', 'found', 'lacking', '2004', 'reboot', 'boorish', 'menace', 'High', 'Council', 'who', 'might', 'time', 'force', 'Doctor', 'do', 'dirty-work', 'them.As', 'episode', 'really', 'true', 'celebration', '50', 'years', 'TARDIS', 'travel', 'Even', 'idea', 'Doctor', 'meeting', 'former', 'selves', 'callback', 'especially', 'David', 'Tennant', 'delivering', 'line', '34', 'Oh', 'see', ""'ve"", 'redecorated', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'it.', '34', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'did', '34', 'Three', 'Doctors', '34', '1972-73', 'Maybe', 'best', 'moment', 'entire', 'episode', 'meeting', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'current', 'Doctor', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'oldest', 'living', 'previous', 'Doctor', 'One', 'thing', 'think', 'will', 'make', 'Whovians', 'happy', 'been', 'declared', 'old', 'rule', 'Time', 'Lords', 'can', 'only', 'regenerate', '13', 'times', 'essentially', 'been', 'overturned', 'as', 'long', 'audience', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'working', 'BBC', 'produce', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'many', 'new', 'episodes', '34', 'Doctor', 'Who', '34', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'more', 'stop', 'reading', 'here', 'story', 'up', 'least', 'one', 'huge', 'mystery', 'been', 'plaguing', 'fans', 'new', 'old', 'what', 'exactly', 'did', 'Doctor', 'do', 'end', 'Last', 'Time', 'War', 'stories', 'seemed', 'burned', 'Gallifrey', 'cinders', 'others', 'Gallifrey', 'described', 'being', 'simply', 'lost', '34', 'End', 'Time', '34', 'Time', 'Lords', 'actually', 'did', 'try', 'return', 'now', 'know', 'least', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'Moffat', 'Davies', 'have', 'been', 'playing', 'long-game', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'towards', 'exactly', 'moment', 'along', 'Essentially', 'Doctor', 'used', 'weapon', 'had', 'conscience', 'could', 'actually', 'speak', 'Appearing', 'form', 'Rose', 'Tyler', 'whom', 'incarnation', 'Doctor', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'met', 'calling', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'see', 'Season', '1', 'new', 'series', 'decided', 'punishment', 'would', 'be', 'survive', 'devastation', 'allowing', 'live', 'then', 'time', 'think', 'consequences', 'live', 'maybe', 'even', 'change', 'end', 'when', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'confronted', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'told', 'not', 'only', 'will', 'have', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'incarnations', 'even', 'returning', 'old', 'models', 'different', 'apparent', 'age-stages', 'Gallifrey', 'out', 'there', 'find', 'do', 'so']",Doctor Who

1670200,A1O5ZPBUQVNYMG,B00F37VHPM,Michael Christy,"[11, 25]","First of all, I wish people would rate the dumb episode based on whether or not it is ANY GOOD, and not because of the price they charged.More to the point... definitely could not have given this episode even close to a 4 star rating, and it barely squeaks by as a 3.  Steven Moffat the writer of Doctor Who for the several years, has really brought down the series to being, not only boring, but predictable, overly embarrassingly sentimental, and very, very unimaginative.  Quite honestly, I think ANY of us who are true die-hard Doctor Who fan could have written a better story line celebrating the 50th years to the month of Doctor Who shows, than Moffat.My complaints are as follows and may complain spoilers, so do not read if you want to know thoughts on the episode before seeing it and judging for yourself.1.  This was just another &#34;THE THREE DOCTORS&#34; episode, which was broadcast in four weekly parts from 30 December 1972 to 20 January 1973.  It starred three Doctors, Pertwee, Troughton, and my favorite Hartnell (who had a very small part since he was very sick at the time).  Basically, it was a story about immortality and the ability to time travel discovered by &#34;Omega&#34; who was a Time Lord at the time, but wanted to become mortal again since the time winds had destroyed his body.  You have to watch this episode but there are a lot of cross over plots.  (So much for &#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34; being original).2.  Next, what happened to the trailer where the Gallifreyan Guardsman spotted the first attack of the Dalek's breaking through the time dam's, during the first trailer about the upcoming major episode.3.  What happened to involving any of the prior companions, which for nostalgic reasons would have meant so much to those of us who are hard-core fans.4.  Moffat claimed that he wanted a story line in which anyone, EVEN those with absolutely NO &#34;Doctor Who&#34; history with the show, could understand it and enjoy it.  IN OTHER WORDS, more concerned with profit than story.5.  Too much time is spent with the William Hurt Doctor, fussing over what to do and speaking to rose, lots of time that could have been better spent on a better story.  (in other words, time killing, typical Moffat writing style)6.  The story is boring, unexciting, adds nothing new to understanding the doctor more, and what is with the Doctor having to marry Queen Elizabeth the 1st.  What possible purpose does that hold in an anniversary special.  DUMB, DUMB, DUMB.7.  Both the two VERY first companions of the doctor, William Russell as Ian Chesterton and the very own Granddaughter of the doctor also not involved in the anniversary special.  Personally, I would LOVE to have known WHY the doctor felt the need to escape from Gallifrey and what was the true relationship between himself and Susan his Granddaughter.  They could have covered this at the very beginning for a lousy 5 minutes instead of the Tardis swinging stupidly from a helicopter to Buckingham palace.8.  Why the Zygons in this Anniversary special... they did not play a huge role as his adversary during the past 50 years and made no impact on the excitement of the story-line.9.  William Hurt as the Doctor who decides to destroy all of Gallifrey and the Dalek's is never mentioned in any prior episodes and they had a whopping 12 doctors to choose from who could have been responsible for that action, such as Tom Baker, and then he would have had a MUCH bigger role.  Personally, his appearance was the only thrill I got from the show.10. Where is Romanadvoratrelundar, for short known only as Romana, I know, I know, she is in E-Space, but she is the 2nd Time Lord to be alive in the Universe so the Doctor, technically is NOT really alone,  Lalla Ward, who played her after the KEY OF TIME series, is still alive and would be wonderful to have seen again, helping the Doctor, or even just with assisting Tom Baker.  She played a crucial role during the recovery of the Key of Time, yet she continues to go on unheard, but &#34;Riversong&#34; (Rori and Amy Ponds child) is always showing up in every episode, saying &#34;Spoilers!&#34;11.  This was the BIGGEST opportunity on the planet for Doctor Who to shine after 50 years of running and it was like any other Moffat episode, I even read he was very worried about this episode being liked after its release.  They could have brought back &#34;Russell T. Davies&#34;  The BEST damn writer from 2005 starting with Eccleston and Tennent.  Moffat made a sporadic for the show from (2005-2013).  A collaboration of the best sci-fi writers in Britain was what was really called for in order to pull off this show.12.  Lastly, I don't know where the show will go on from here, the newest Doctor is actor, Peter Capaldi, who was last seen on a Doctor Who episode called &#34;Fires of Pompeii.&#34;  From his appearance only, he looks more like an aging, experienced doctor than the pin-ups we have been getting before, except for David Tennent whom in my opinion, is right up there with Tom Baker, and William Hartnell as great Doctors.13.  By the way, in another trailer the showed a look alike Doctor William Hartnell in the junk yard where it all started, but never saw him???  Bad teasing trailers to disappoint you after spending your $7.95 to watch the move length episode.And, there you have it, 13 complaints for 13 time-lords, btw, whatever happened to it was impossible for any Time-Lord to regenerate MORE than 12 times.  Hmmmm.  So, there you have it 13 complaints.The Doctor  Portrayed by  TenureFirst Doctor  William Hartnell 1963&#8211;1966[note 5]Second Doctor  Patrick Troughton 1966&#8211;1969[note 5]Third Doctor  Jon Pertwee  1970&#8211;1974[note 5]Fourth Doctor  Tom Baker  1974&#8211;1981[note 5]Fifth Doctor  Peter Davison  1981&#8211;1984[note 5]Sixth Doctor  Colin Baker  1984&#8211;1986Seventh Doctor  Sylvester McCoy  1987&#8211;1989, 1996[84][85][86]Eighth Doctor  Paul McGann  1996Ninth Doctor  Christopher Eccleston  2005Tenth Doctor  David Tennant  2005&#8211;2010[note 5]Eleventh Doctor  Matt Smith  2010&#8211;201312??????  William Hurt  Time - War Only13th  Peter Capaldi  2014 - ?  (even though it is NOT true, they are claiming Peter Capaldi is the 12th Doctor.  I guess William Hurt was just a flash in the pan???  I imagine they believe no one can count in the 21st Century.  You know even in Star Trek they cared about &#34;Continuity,&#34; maybe in Britain money and a long standing sci-fi series speaks louder than that?  The &#34;Master&#34; the Doctor's arch enemy jumped through unimaginable hoops to extend his regeneration, apparently the Doctor has a get out of Death card.Thanks for reading my review, and please keep my personal complaints in mind, I am not a troll of the &#34;Doctor Who&#34; show, I am more-overly an extreme fan-boy of the show and was born in 1963, 2 months before the first Doctor Who even aired.  Grew up on it every since. I love the show, which is why I am so fed up where it is being taken to, and both its overly commercialized actions for BBC profits instead of entertainment as it used to be.Michael Christy",3,"I love

We kind of knew it already, from the last episodes of David Tennant's time as the Doctor.  But in The Day of the Doctor we learn about just how guilty he felt about it.  To the point where he refused to even allow himself to even hold the title of Doctor.  It makes more sense when you watch the special.I am not a big fan of Rose but, funny enough, Billie Piper played Bad Wolf, so that's okay.  We get to see the Daleks and even see the Zygons back in action.  And we get to visit the Time Lords again.Now, we get to see two new Time Lords.  John Hurt, a favorite actor of mine, who has brought many wonderful and horrible parts to life.  He played Smith in my favorite version of Nineteen Eighty-Four, so I don't mean he was horrible at it, it is just a dark piece.He plays a wonderful Doctor, old and tired and bitter and making a decision that will change the very universe itself.We also get a glimpse of the future, and last, Doctor.  Well, his eyes and eyebrows.There is a lot of humor and the interaction between Hurt, Smith, and Tennant is wonderful.  It is always nice to see scenes where the Doctors get together.The Zygon sub-plot isn't that bad either and they do a good job of keeping the whole story moving without any bumps in the road and without over using special effects.

Once again we have scenes showing how much someone wants to get into the Doctors pants and the teeny boppers swoon. Billie Piper seemed wasted in the role she did play. She plays primarily the conscience of the doctor. That could have been played by anyone and the story does not explain why it has to be her. Any explanation could be chalked up to assumptions because the story doesnt tell us why out of all the characters, companions and species that the doctor has encountered it had to be Rose playing his conscience.The villainous Zygons are introduced quite well and are rather menacing however that threat is not really resolved. The plot resolution that we do get with them had already been done previously with the Silurians in the series 5 two episode story Hungry Earth/Cold Blood.John Hurt was overall fine in this story but for a character who was built up as a massive mystery is more or less sidelined to highlight Matt Smith and the return of Tennent.

1670208,A2DAV67SVAKTOH,B00F37VHPM,Mr K Shepherd,"[1, 1]","This story is amongst the top five of any Doctor Who story bar none. The absolute attention to detail alone and the way it tied in events that loosely or otherwise were connected was done so very well, even my wife who casually watches new Who with me from time to time (no pun) said how impressed she was with how they were able to have so much attention to detail.For me it was great to finally see why the Zygon's home planet was lost - answer time war, nice way to fill in that gap after so many years. The Eighth Doctor's regeneration was finally shown in what I can only describe as such a treat in the Night of the Doctor and showed after 18 years how Paul McGann is still and always will be such a good Doctor and his only episode in 1996 was such a waste, but we got to finally see his end, so at least we now have a beginning and finale for him - closure of sorts finally. The idea of paintings in the background of the main feature was a good ploy to show how the Zygons and indeed Gallifrey survived to re-enter our world, like the idea of Galiferian art capturing one moment in time, ha moment! The interaction between David Tennant and Matt Smith were fabulous and the addition of the gravitas of John Hurt who also seamlessly jumps in as the War Doctor, adding an older voice to the typical multi-doctor bickering and self appreciation.But what a treat at the end, Tom Baker as the mysterious curator and to see all the doctors up to Matt Smith in his dream sequence paying homage again to the past.The production of the whole story here shows how grand it was in the eyes of those that made it, it felt like a feature rather than an episode but didn't lose it's British TV background, which the 1996 outing for Paul McGann I think did.I watched this finally with my wife in late Jan 2014, so was very good in waiting all that time but could tell despite her really trying to absorb and understand some very fan related things she thoroughly enjoyed it too, which I think was the point, die hard fans like me loving it and non-fans also appreciating it too. Like the art it showcased, a masterpiece!The extras are fabulous, not much - but great additions, the history of Doctor Who is fantastic (no pun on 9) and has some great interviews with new and old to look at the whole 50 years of the show and being narrated by Colin Baker makes it all the more special as he is sort of half-way in the history of it all. The making of the 50th shows how absolutely secret the whole operation had been, and it was appreciated so surprises could be had. The mini episodes - and referring to the Night of the Doctor specifically - are worth their weight in gold and to me are added to the list of full episodes and show what Paul could have been on TV if used right, thank you Steven Moffatt for that one at least, I was one happy fan when the internet showed this one, and finally seeing it fulfilled my Whology in ways I cannot tell you.In short fans HAVE to have this one, and it also is a great escape to casual viewers for an hour and a half, do it!",5,Very few match this,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,3059,"['story', 'top', 'five', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'story', 'bar', 'none', 'absolute', 'attention', 'detail', 'alone', 'way', 'tied', 'events', 'loosely', 'otherwise', 'were', 'connected', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'even', 'wife', 'who', 'casually', 'new', 'Who', 'time', 'time', 'pun', 'said', 'how', 'impressed', 'was', 'how', 'were', 'able', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'detail.For', 'was', 'great', 'finally', 'see', 'why', 'Zygon', 'home', 'planet', 'was', 'lost', 'answer', 'time', 'war', 'nice', 'way', 'fill', 'gap', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'Eighth', 'Doctor', 'regeneration', 'was', 'finally', 'shown', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'such', 'treat', 'Night', 'Doctor', 'showed', '18', 'years', 'how', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'still', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'such', 'good', 'Doctor', 'only', 'episode', '1996', 'was', 'such', 'waste', 'got', 'finally', 'see', 'end', 'so', 'least', 'now', 'have', 'beginning', 'finale', 'closure', 'sorts', 'finally', 'idea', 'paintings', 'background', 'main', 'feature', 'was', 'good', 'ploy', 'show', 'how', 'Zygons', 'indeed', 'Gallifrey', 'survived', 're-enter', 'world', 'idea', 'Galiferian', 'art', 'capturing', 'one', 'moment', 'time', 'ha', 'moment', 'interaction', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'were', 'fabulous', 'addition', 'gravitas', 'John', 'Hurt', 'who', 'also', 'seamlessly', 'War', 'Doctor', 'adding', 'older', 'voice', 'typical', 'multi-doctor', 'bickering', 'self', 'appreciation.But', 'what', 'treat', 'end', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'mysterious', 'curator', 'see', 'doctors', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'dream', 'sequence', 'paying', 'homage', 'again', 'past.The', 'production', 'whole', 'story', 'here', 'how', 'grand', 'was', 'eyes', 'made', 'felt', 'feature', 'rather', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'British', 'TV', 'background', '1996', 'outing', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'think', 'did.I', 'watched', 'finally', 'wife', 'late', 'Jan', '2014', 'so', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'waiting', 'time', 'could', 'tell', 'really', 'trying', 'absorb', 'understand', 'very', 'fan', 'related', 'things', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'too', 'think', 'was', 'point', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'loving', 'non-fans', 'also', 'appreciating', 'too', 'art', 'showcased', 'masterpiece', 'extras', 'are', 'fabulous', 'not', 'much', 'great', 'additions', 'history', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fantastic', 'pun', '9', 'great', 'interviews', 'new', 'old', 'look', 'whole', '50', 'years', 'show', 'being', 'narrated', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'more', 'special', 'sort', 'half-way', 'history', 'making', '50th', 'how', 'absolutely', 'whole', 'operation', 'had', 'been', 'was', 'appreciated', 'so', 'surprises', 'could', 'be', 'had', 'mini', 'referring', 'Night', 'Doctor', 'specifically', 'are', 'worth', 'weight', 'gold', 'are', 'added', 'list', 'full', 'episodes', 'show', 'what', 'Paul', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'TV', 'used', 'right', 'thank', 'Steven', 'Moffatt', 'one', 'least', 'was', 'one', 'happy', 'fan', 'when', 'internet', 'showed', 'one', 'finally', 'seeing', 'fulfilled', 'Whology', 'ways', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'you.In', 'short', 'fans', 'HAVE', 'have', 'one', 'also', 'great', 'escape', 'casual', 'viewers', 'hour', 'half', 'do']",Doctor Who

But then, I'm betting every review makes the same claim.  I'm not going to get too much into the story, since by now you already know what it is, or I'm going to spoil it for you.  So I'll get to the pros at cons.Pros:1. If you do not yet have a 3D player and 3D TV, this still comes with a 2D version.  So if you ever upgrade, you don't have to buy this again.  And for those that have the ability to see this in 3D at home, you will not be disappointed.2. The two prequels are included3. The making of special is also included, which was aired in the theatres.  It's called ""Behind the Lens"", is voiced over by Colin Baker, and is roughly 15 mins long.Cons:1. No commentary.  SERIOUSLY?!?  How could there NOT be one of these on this monumental achievement in Doctor Who history?  I think that they are holding out on this, and will include it in a later release to get people to buy this again.2. Extra excerpts that were in the theater were not included, such as the 10th and 11th Doctors explaining 3D, and Stark explaining theater etiquette.  Again, possibly another hold out?Personally, I really enjoyed the story.  It has the sometimes over complicated Steven Moffatt bits and pieces, but that's to be expected.  But if you have been a fan of the new series, this simply is a MUST HAVE.I know this review is brief compared to my other Doctor Who reviews.  And while I could have made this a huge read through by adding spoilers, highlighting the good and not so good parts, but again, I think most people already know the story.2-19-14 UPDATE:  Yup.  Just as I expected, a Collector's Edition is scheduled to be released, date yet unknown.  The 2 extra features there were in the theater will be included, and a deleted scene.

""reviews"" posted. This is because Amazon groups ALL reviews of all formats of films, TV shows, etc together, whether they were aired on TV (the 50th Anniversary special aired in more countries than any other TV show on the same day!), were available for streaming (Amazon Instant) or on a physical DVD or BD. As I often mention in my reviews, it is important to look at the ""version"" that is being reviewed. This is of the BD/DVD 3D Combo pack).I will say up front that I do not have a 3D player (never saw need for one) so I can't report on that function - and if someone has a 3D player, they may want to note that in title of their review.- but the BD player fine in my player and the image on my 40: flat screen was great.The set includes The Day of the Doctor (approx. 80 minutes), Doctor Who Explained (approx. 45 minutes) , two mini-episodes, ""The Night of the Doctor"" and ""The Last Day,"" a 13-minute ""making of"" featurette and two trailers: the trailer that played at Comic Con and the first 50th Anniversary trailer.Now, I only recently discovered the Doctor Who series and won't hold myself out as knowledgeable about its 50-year run. As a novice, I did find the ""Doctor Who Explained"" episode (available separately on Amazon Instant) well thought out and helping to fill in missing pieces for me. It might be redundant for those fans who have watched the whole series and repeat the lines when they re-watch the episodes.The purpose of this package from BBC America seems to be to compile the shorter pieces produced for the ""Big 5-0"" of Dr.W into one package and to give those with 3-D players and TVs a chance to see the episode in a format that they can't stream (and, of course, show off their equipment.)For more details on the individual components, I'll leave you to peruse the comments from the previous 288 reviewers.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Review of the Combo BD/DVD/3D version  - All the 50th short projects in one place.,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,2110,"['So', 'here', 'December', '10th', 'release', 'date', 'Doctor', 'Who', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'Special', 'Day', 'Doctor', 'Blu-ray', '3D', '/', 'Blu-ray', '/', 'DVD', 'Combo', 'are', 'alreadt', '288', 'reviews', 'posted', 'Amazon', 'groups', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'formats', 'films', 'TV', 'shows', 'etc', 'together', 'were', 'aired', 'TV', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'special', 'aired', 'more', 'countries', 'other', 'TV', 'show', 'same', 'day', 'were', 'available', 'streaming', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'physical', 'DVD', 'BD', 'often', 'mention', 'reviews', 'important', 'look', 'version', 'being', 'reviewed', 'BD/DVD', '3D', 'Combo', 'pack', '.I', 'will', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'do', 'not', 'have', '3D', 'player', 'never', 'saw', 'need', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'report', 'function', 'someone', '3D', 'player', 'may', 'want', 'note', 'title', 'review.-', 'BD', 'player', 'fine', 'player', 'image', '40', 'flat', 'screen', 'was', 'great.The', 'set', 'Day', 'Doctor', 'approx', '80', 'minutes', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Explained', 'approx', '45', 'minutes', 'two', 'mini-episodes', 'Night', 'Doctor', 'Last', 'Day', '13-minute', 'making', 'featurette', 'two', 'trailers', 'trailer', 'played', 'Comic', 'Con', 'first', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'trailer.Now', 'only', 'recently', 'discovered', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hold', 'out', 'knowledgeable', '50-year', 'run', 'novice', 'did', 'find', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Explained', 'episode', 'available', 'separately', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'helping', 'fill', 'missing', 'pieces', 'might', 'be', 'redundant', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'repeat', 'lines', 'when', 're-watch', 'episodes.The', 'purpose', 'package', 'BBC', 'America', 'be', 'compile', 'shorter', 'pieces', 'produced', 'Big', '5-0', 'Dr.W', 'one', 'package', 'give', '3-D', 'players', 'TVs', 'chance', 'see', 'episode', 'format', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stream', 'course', 'show', 'off', 'equipment', 'more', 'details', 'individual', 'components', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'peruse', 'comments', 'previous', '288', 'reviewers.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Doctor Who

The ultimate, heart-wrenching moment in Doctor Who mythos (right up there with the show's cancellation, or 'long rest' in 1989) that changed everything about who the Doctor is and what he can accomplish. The Name of the Doctor started this trilogy, leading up to the 50th Anniversary and Holiday specials, by introducing us to the unknown Doctor who fought or at least lived through the Time War (We don't actually see him fighting, but he looks like a survivor) as portrayed by John Hurt. Here we come to the Moment, where the War Doctor (as we call him) has to decide whether or not he should destroy Gallifrey, and we get...an unexpected Moment, a Moment that changes everything as well.That Moment is Billie Piper as Rose/Bad Wolf and it seems fitting when, yes, she was the first person who appeared in the New Series of Doctor Who, launching it to critical acclaim and worldwide, enormous popularity. After all, Ian and Barbara were among the first people who appeared in Doctor Who, although the very first was that policeman; the companions are the ones who started it all, in a sense. She is the one who helps the War Doctor see what becomes of his decision, introducing him to the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors. Clara accompanies Eleven to the National Gallery to investigate a mysterious painting left behind by Queen Elizabeth, enjoying a picnic with Ten before some Zygons crash the party and start messing things up. Ten and Eleven, in the midst of all this, aren't too thrilled to have the War Doctor around when he is a painful reminder of their past, but neither of them are aware that the past is in flux, and currently, the Moment is right to change everything.",5,The Moment that Changed Everything,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,1915,"['come', '50', 'years', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'graced', 'TV', 'screens', 'books', 'comics', 'audio', 'plays', 'more', 'now', 'Doctor', 'should', 'say', 'Doctors', 'face', 'been', 'biggest', 'problem', 'nearly', '9', 'years', 'now', 'Time', 'War', 'ultimate', 'heart-wrenching', 'moment', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'mythos', 'right', 'there', 'show', 'cancellation', ""'long"", 'rest', '1989', 'changed', 'everything', 'who', 'Doctor', 'what', 'can', 'accomplish', 'Name', 'Doctor', 'started', 'trilogy', 'leading', 'up', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'Holiday', 'specials', 'introducing', 'unknown', 'Doctor', 'who', 'fought', 'least', 'lived', 'Time', 'War', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'fighting', 'survivor', 'portrayed', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Here', 'come', 'Moment', 'where', 'War', 'Doctor', 'call', 'decide', 'not', 'should', 'destroy', 'Gallifrey', 'get', 'unexpected', 'Moment', 'Moment', 'everything', 'well.That', 'Moment', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'Rose/Bad', 'Wolf', 'fitting', 'when', 'yes', 'was', 'first', 'person', 'who', 'appeared', 'New', 'Series', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'launching', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'worldwide', 'enormous', 'popularity', 'Ian', 'Barbara', 'were', 'first', 'people', 'who', 'appeared', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'very', 'first', 'was', 'policeman', 'companions', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'started', 'sense', 'one', 'who', 'War', 'Doctor', 'see', 'what', 'decision', 'introducing', 'Tenth', 'Eleventh', 'Doctors', 'Clara', 'Eleven', 'National', 'Gallery', 'investigate', 'mysterious', 'painting', 'left', 'behind', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'enjoying', 'picnic', 'Ten', 'Zygons', 'crash', 'party', 'start', 'messing', 'things', 'up', 'Ten', 'Eleven', 'midst', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'thrilled', 'have', 'War', 'Doctor', 'when', 'painful', 'reminder', 'past', 'are', 'aware', 'past', 'flux', 'currently', 'Moment', 'right', 'change', 'everything']",Doctor Who

O'Sullivan,"[19, 36]","As a 50th Anniversary special celebrating the series - it almost works.***SPOILERS AHEAD***It's fast, fun, funny and deals with interesting insider gimmicks and nods to the present and original series all over the place and fun to stop the frame again and again to pick out the little details (and one whopping one at the end - which, was a real pleasure to see) - it's special, looks great (this is a real test for a full feature length Doctor Who movie and not just a translation of the show) and the performances are very good nearly all around.But - and here's the problem - this less a special celebrating the series and more just a reset button for the series going forward.  After seven series of New Who it looks they realized they have painted themselves in a corner when it comes to telling new stories so, goodbye to the Time War and the Doctor's PTSD in dealing with it, as it turns it...it was all just an elaborate ruse by the Doctor (8.5) to fool himself into thinking he had killed not only the Daleks, but the Time Lords as well (well - more to the point - Time Lord children, there is not a thought spared for the adults at all, the children get all the flashbacks and tears here) and the years after, his distress, fear, hated of himself and growing anger towards the universe and his turn as the Time Lord Victorious are all just a fib.This is what really brought the special down for me.  It was no longer Doctor who?  But Doctor what? - exactly who is the Doctor now knowing that his efforts to stop the Time War actually...failed?  If you stop and think about it, the Doctor did nothing in the end.  The Daleks live (despite the rather clever crossfire resolution to the problem) and the Time Lords are now in a pocket universe waiting to be found and the Doctor's darkest day, his most brutal of choices, his forced hand to end the war and save the universe means nothing.  All his development towards being a better Doctor, a better Time Lord, and a better person are all based on a self-made lie.First rule: the Doctor lies - even to himself it seems.I was very surprised how neatly this was brushed away, how quickly it was swept under the rug and all the effort made from the 9th Doctor down has been suspended and I assume now erased.  But, in the end, it was a necessary evil on the part of the series to free itself from the baggage that they had been picking up and never paid off on.  River Song was really a bust, the build-up about Donna never followed through, the Silence never went anywhere and the Doctor's grave...well...we just learned the origin of Clara (The Impossible Girl) and nothing else.You'll notice I've said nothing of the Zygons yet and that's for a reason...why are they here?  I assume this will be an ongoing plot in the return of the series after the Christmas special, but, as for its place here, they are all set up and nothing more.  We learn nothing of the treaty at the end, we learn nothing of the Zygons end goals, we learn nothing of what happened to anyone - it's a loose thread of time and money that could have been better spent on just dealing with the three Doctor's.John Hurt is fine but his part his thin, which was a surprise.  The return of ""Rose"" was actually well done and a true surprise to me - I love the idea of a bomb that can talk itself out of being exploded; we are sure to see this device again as it never stated what happened to it after the non-Time War.  Both the 10th and 11th Doctor shine and it's their show - each work well against the other and solo as well and the 10th becoming Kind of England should have some consequences down the line.I don't like Clara - the actress is fine - but her part has never been fleshed out and I long for the days when the Doctor's companions were not sentient parts of time and space in a skirt saving the Doctor from himself all the time (if anything, Martha is the only one in the recent series that was not a God - Rose, Donna, Amy, River, Clara - all super powered beings, not a mortal among them and they each have the power to alter time and space - wrong - give me Martha any day, give me a new Sarah Jane Smith - give anything but another girl with Godlike powers, please).Overall - this special is special, don't get me wrong.  But as a story, it's clearly housekeeping - it's just brushing everything that has come before it under the rug and that's not special at all, that's just sloppy writing, simple choices and a GET OUT OF JAIL FREE card to the series to move forward...and I am looking forward to the new series, but I am not giving it any slack either.You get one and you used it - 50 is a good number to take stock and start something new, so run, you clever boy, and remember - you do have a history and it's worth remembering.",2,BETTER THAN ONE?,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,4776,"['50th', 'Anniversary', 'special', 'celebrating', 'series', 'almost', '***SPOILERS', 'AHEAD***It', 'fast', 'fun', 'funny', 'deals', 'interesting', 'insider', 'gimmicks', 'nods', 'present', 'original', 'series', 'place', 'fun', 'stop', 'frame', 'again', 'again', 'pick', 'out', 'little', 'details', 'one', 'whopping', 'one', 'end', 'was', 'real', 'pleasure', 'see', 'special', 'great', 'real', 'test', 'full', 'feature', 'length', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'translation', 'show', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'nearly', 'around.But', 'here', 'problem', 'less', 'special', 'celebrating', 'series', 'more', 'just', 'reset', 'button', 'series', 'going', 'forward', 'seven', 'series', 'New', 'Who', 'realized', 'have', 'painted', 'corner', 'when', 'telling', 'new', 'stories', 'so', 'goodbye', 'Time', 'War', 'Doctor', 'PTSD', 'dealing', 'was', 'just', 'elaborate', 'ruse', 'Doctor', '8.5', 'fool', 'thinking', 'had', 'killed', 'not', 'only', 'Daleks', 'Time', 'Lords', 'as', 'well', 'well', 'more', 'point', 'Time', 'Lord', 'children', 'not', 'thought', 'spared', 'adults', 'children', 'get', 'flashbacks', 'tears', 'here', 'years', 'distress', 'fear', 'hated', 'growing', 'anger', 'universe', 'turn', 'Time', 'Lord', 'Victorious', 'are', 'just', 'fib.This', 'what', 'really', 'brought', 'special', 'down', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'Doctor', 'who', 'Doctor', 'what', 'exactly', 'who', 'Doctor', 'now', 'knowing', 'efforts', 'stop', 'Time', 'War', 'actually', 'failed', 'stop', 'think', 'Doctor', 'did', 'nothing', 'end', 'Daleks', 'live', 'rather', 'clever', 'crossfire', 'resolution', 'problem', 'Time', 'Lords', 'are', 'now', 'pocket', 'universe', 'waiting', 'be', 'found', 'Doctor', 'darkest', 'day', 'most', 'brutal', 'choices', 'forced', 'hand', 'end', 'war', 'save', 'universe', 'nothing', 'development', 'towards', 'being', 'better', 'Doctor', 'better', 'Time', 'Lord', 'better', 'person', 'are', 'based', 'self-made', 'lie.First', 'rule', 'Doctor', 'even', 'seems.I', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'how', 'neatly', 'was', 'brushed', 'away', 'how', 'quickly', 'was', 'swept', 'rug', 'effort', 'made', '9th', 'Doctor', 'down', 'been', 'suspended', 'assume', 'now', 'erased', 'end', 'was', 'necessary', 'evil', 'part', 'series', 'free', 'baggage', 'had', 'been', 'picking', 'up', 'never', 'paid', 'off', 'River', 'Song', 'was', 'really', 'bust', 'build-up', 'Donna', 'never', 'followed', 'Silence', 'never', 'went', 'anywhere', 'Doctor', 'grave', 'well', 'just', 'learned', 'origin', 'Clara', 'Impossible', 'Girl', 'nothing', 'else.You', ""'ll"", 'notice', ""'ve"", 'said', 'nothing', 'Zygons', 'yet', 'reason', 'why', 'are', 'here', 'assume', 'will', 'be', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'return', 'series', 'Christmas', 'special', 'place', 'here', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'nothing', 'more', 'learn', 'nothing', 'treaty', 'end', 'learn', 'nothing', 'Zygons', 'end', 'goals', 'learn', 'nothing', 'what', 'happened', 'anyone', 'loose', 'thread', 'time', 'money', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'spent', 'just', 'dealing', 'three', ""Doctor's.John"", 'Hurt', 'fine', 'part', 'thin', 'was', 'surprise', 'return', 'Rose', 'was', 'actually', 'well', 'done', 'true', 'surprise', 'love', 'idea', 'bomb', 'can', 'talk', 'being', 'exploded', 'are', 'sure', 'see', 'device', 'again', 'never', 'stated', 'what', 'happened', 'non-Time', 'War', '10th', '11th', 'Doctor', 'shine', 'show', 'work', 'well', 'other', 'solo', 'as', 'well', '10th', 'becoming', 'Kind', 'England', 'should', 'have', 'consequences', 'down', 'line.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Clara', 'actress', 'fine', 'part', 'never', 'been', 'fleshed', 'long', 'days', 'when', 'Doctor', 'companions', 'were', 'not', 'sentient', 'parts', 'time', 'space', 'skirt', 'saving', 'Doctor', 'time', 'anything', 'Martha', 'only', 'one', 'recent', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'God', 'Rose', 'Donna', 'Amy', 'River', 'Clara', 'super', 'powered', 'beings', 'not', 'mortal', 'have', 'power', 'alter', 'time', 'space', 'wrong', 'give', 'Martha', 'day', 'give', 'new', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Smith', 'give', 'anything', 'girl', 'Godlike', 'powers', 'please', '.Overall', 'special', 'special', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'story', 'clearly', 'housekeeping', 'just', 'brushing', 'everything', 'come', 'rug', 'not', 'special', 'just', 'sloppy', 'writing', 'simple', 'choices', 'GET', 'OUT', 'OF', 'JAIL', 'FREE', 'card', 'series', 'move', 'forward', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'new', 'series', 'am', 'not', 'giving', 'slack', 'either.You', 'get', 'one', 'used', '50', 'good', 'number', 'take', 'stock', 'start', 'something', 'new', 'so', 'run', 'clever', 'boy', 'remember', 'do', 'have', 'history', 'worth', 'remembering']",Doctor Who

I said this was like our Superbowl except this isn't an annual event. This is most likely the biggest television event that will ever occur in my life and exceeded any expectations I could have had (to be fair, I had no idea what to expect). To see my first Doctor (Eleven) in the same episode as my favorite Doctor (Ten) was incredibly entertaining. John Hurt's Doctor was also far more entertaining than I could have imagined but once again, I had no clue what to expect. The cast was absolutely amazing. The DVD has some nice extras, I'm not one to complain but having the deleted scenes would have been nice (I guess they're on the internet somewhere).I know some people really wanted the Ninth Doctor to come back but he didn't want to so try to get past that. Some people wanted Captain Jack to come back but I think after the mess that was the last installment of Torchwood it may be best that he wasn't involved.

There are several other surprise appearances that I will absolutely not spoil. Suffice to say that fans, new and old, will be very, very happy with them.This special was as close to perfect, without Eccleston, as it could get, though I do wish the villains were a little more threatening, though that is nothing more than a nitpick.

Then I heard the voices echoing off the walls from neighbors and friends that the fiftieth anniversary was coming. I of course was always familiar with the old school Who that used to be on at 2 in the morning on PBS like twenty years ago, but through the influence of my friends acting as enthusiatic disciples of all things WHO I jumped on board this new bit, discovering that this was far and away many things the old Who was not. I was quickly hooked, taking my time and relishing the entire seven seasons of the modern run. (Season 1 Christopher Eccleson, Seasons 2-4 David Tennant and seasons 5-7 Matt Smith, making doctors 9 thru 11, just in case you didn't know...)One may find interesting that the latest companion, Clara, shows a dose of dark mystery dealing in the fact that her soul has basically been scattered across time in pieces, which I think sets up the tone here with spectacular brilliance (if I may, think that) in which we are never really sure what is real in the physical, real in the mind, or really just some psychosis dreamed up entirely by John Hurt from 900 years ago on the planet Galifrey (John Hurt makes his debut as the original, non number regenerated doctor from the Time Wars...He's time lapse vistiting himself via some futuristic conciousness delivered ala Bad Wolf in the form of previous companion Rose Tyler, who only he can see...keep in mind he hasn't actually met her yet???! Confused? Just ride it out.)This special is pound for pound everything a Whovee could ever wish for. The cameos all bare fruit and the multiple doctor element works very well.

It provides a critical link the arrival of the War Doctor played by John Hurt.The second mini-episode focuses on the attack of Arcadia the city on the planet Gallifrey where the War Doctor activated the device to end the Time War.We also get a very good behind-the-scenes featurette on the production of the episode with plenty of comments from Tennant, Smith and the other returning cast members.This is a terrific 50th anniversary special and the mini-episode &#34;Night of the Doctor&#34; delightfullly ties everything together and allows McGann to appear as The Doctor again.Highly recommended!",5,Blu-ray review: terrific 50th anniversary special allowing for cameos and a nice lead in to the Christmas episode,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,2115,"['entertaining', '50th', 'anniversary', 'special', '34', 'Day', 'Doctor', '34', 'together', '10th', 'David', 'Tennant', '11th', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'incarnations', 'Doctor', 'together', 'previously', 'introduced', 'War', 'Doctor', 'John', 'Hurt', '.SPOILERS', 'War', 'Doctor', 'fought', 'ended', 'Time', 'War', 'Time', 'Lords', 'Daleks', 'destroying', 'galaxy', '34', 'Day', 'Doctor', '34', 'place', 'three', 'time', 'periods', 'two', 'worlds', '11th', 'Doctor', 'call', 'UNIT', 'when', 'figures', '3D', 'painting', 'depicting', 'end', 'Gallifrey', 'disappear.The', '10th', 'Doctor', 'tries', 'stop', 'Zygons', 'shape', 'shifting', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Elizabethian', 'period', 'changing', 'timeline.All', 'three', 'end', 'up', 'Elizabethian', 'period', 'try', 'prevent', 'Zygons', 'taking', 'over', 'Earth', 'War', 'Doctor', 'not', 'end', 'lives', 'two', 'races', 'part', 'Time', 'War', 'Capped', 'appearance', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'special', 'terrific', 'job', 'resetting', 'elements', 'series', 'also', 'up', 'elements', 'Smith', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'closed', 'off', 'appearance', 'Doctor', '.END', 'SPOILERS', 'Featuring', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'variety', 'past', 'Who', 'cast', 'members', '34', 'Day', 'Doctor', '34', 'exceptional', '1080p', 'high', 'def', 'presentation', 'terrific', '5.1', 'audio', 'mix.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'two', 'mini-episodes', 'first', '34', 'Night', 'Doctor', '34', 'surprise', 'delightful', 'appearance', 'Paul', 'McGann', '8th', 'Doctor', 'who', 'appeared', 'TV', 'movie', '34', 'Doctor', 'Who', '34', '1990', 'critical', 'link', 'arrival', 'War', 'Doctor', 'played', 'John', 'Hurt.The', 'second', 'mini-episode', 'focuses', 'attack', 'Arcadia', 'city', 'planet', 'Gallifrey', 'where', 'War', 'Doctor', 'activated', 'device', 'end', 'Time', 'War.We', 'also', 'get', 'very', 'good', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'production', 'episode', 'plenty', 'comments', 'Tennant', 'Smith', 'other', 'returning', 'cast', 'members.This', 'terrific', '50th', 'anniversary', 'special', 'mini-episode', '34', 'Night', 'Doctor', '34', 'delightfullly', 'everything', 'together', 'McGann', 'appear', 'Doctor', 'again.Highly', 'recommended']",Doctor Who

Corse ""OldOneEye""","[0, 0]","If you somehow missed this 50th Anniversary Special episode and are a Dr. Who fan, whether young or old, you owe it to yourself to see this one -- I guarantee you can't watch it just once.  Steven Moffat's script is his best to date, with Matt Smith and 10th Doctor David Tennant generating great on-screen chemistry, plus veteran actor John Hurt as the tragic War Doctor and Billie Piper (Rose Tyler) serving as the conscience for all three.  Plus a very nice walk-on at the end by our favorite classic Doctor, Tom Baker.

Seemed like a slight to a very good actor whom deserved better and I know it wasnt because he wasnt willing. I liked the story for the most part. Loved the interaction between Doctors 10 & 11. Loved seeing Doctor 4 at the end.
