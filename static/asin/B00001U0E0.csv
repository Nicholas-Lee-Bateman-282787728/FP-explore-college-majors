He catches her and strangles her to death. The next day, he tells his psychiatrist about it, and that THE MASK made him do it. The doctor doesn't believe him, so he storms out of his office. Later, the man, named Michael, commits suicide, and the cops get involved. A package arrives for the doctor. It seems that Michael mailed THE MASK to his office right before killing himself. Shockingly, the doctor puts THE MASK on his head, causing him to enter a hideous netherworld of supernatural horror! For 1961 this is very well-realized. The 3D effect is pretty damned cool!

511864,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B00001U0E0,Danno,"[3, 4]","Here's an odd one - a 3-D film released a few years after the 3-D craze ended, in which only certain sequences actually require those infamous red-blue glasses. This film revolves around a psychiatrist (played by a Martin Landau lookalike) who becomes obsessed with a presumably Central American mask, and believes it has supernatural powers. Most of the movie has awful continuity and plotting that goes absolutely nowhere; I'm convinced that there's at least one reel of missing footage near the middle. Technically, it's got that Twilight Zone/noir look that many horror films of the late 1950s/early 1960s have.The dream sequences, however, are why the film is remembered. They are filmed in 3-D, and have suitably eerie and surreal imagery. Yes, at times they simply poke scary props at us. But there's an attention to detail and an attempt to capture the look and feel of a nightmare or a hallucination. In fact, if this were a better movie, I'd suggest that the story is an allegory about drug abuse given the trippy nature of the dream imagery.Definitely an acquired taste, but worth having if you caught it on TV back in the 1980s or are a fan of bizarre movies like ""The Trip.""",3,Weird dream sequences!,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,1187,"['Here', 'odd', 'one', '3-D', 'film', 'released', 'few', 'years', '3-D', 'craze', 'ended', 'only', 'certain', 'sequences', 'actually', 'require', 'infamous', 'red-blue', 'glasses', 'film', 'around', 'psychiatrist', 'played', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'lookalike', 'who', 'obsessed', 'presumably', 'Central', 'American', 'mask', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'Most', 'movie', 'awful', 'continuity', 'plotting', 'absolutely', 'nowhere', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'least', 'one', 'reel', 'missing', 'footage', 'middle', 'Technically', 'got', 'Twilight', 'Zone/noir', 'look', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'late', '1950s/early', '1960s', 'have.The', 'dream', 'sequences', 'however', 'are', 'why', 'film', 'remembered', 'are', 'filmed', '3-D', 'have', 'suitably', 'eerie', 'surreal', 'imagery', 'Yes', 'times', 'simply', 'poke', 'scary', 'props', 'attention', 'detail', 'attempt', 'capture', 'look', 'feel', 'nightmare', 'hallucination', 'fact', 'were', 'better', 'movie', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'story', 'allegory', 'drug', 'abuse', 'given', 'trippy', 'nature', 'dream', 'imagery.Definitely', 'acquired', 'taste', 'having', 'caught', 'TV', 'back', '1980s', 'are', 'fan', 'bizarre', 'movies', 'Trip']",N/A
511865,A14PS3LPIO7UF8,B00001U0E0,"Dawoud Kringle ""Renegade Sufi""","[8, 9]","I saw this movie on TV many years ago. As I was much younger, and as I recall, up to my eyebrows in ""refreshments"", I thought it was a great movie. So when I saw that it was finally on DVD, I HAD to get a copy. It was, at the time, a fairly original idea. And as my old friend Greg Horn (see review above) said, its obvious where the idea of the comic book and Jim Carry movie originated.Well, despite the flaws in the movie, I certainly got my money's worth. The flaws were absolutely hilarious. The director must have been on some strong medication - probably to offset the tiny budget and third rate actors he was forced to work with. I lost count of how many times the script referred to it being night (i.e. the psychiatrist driving his car and picking up his secretary, whom he was banging behind his fiance's back, in broad daylight, parking his car, and telling her to ""Look at the stars!""). The fight scene near the end between the shrink driven mad by the mask and the dour, half-baked looking police detective was hilarious; especially the pathetic parody of a karate chop to the shoulder that finally subdued the hapless lunatic. There were too many holes in the plot to keep track of without taking notes. And EVERYBODY was smoking cigarettes like there was no tomorrow!But it was the dream sequences and accompanying music that really made the film. The sequences were directed by Slavko Vorkapich; and you knew where the loin's share of the film's budget went. These scenes were quite well done. There is a feeling of fear and nightmarish surrealism in them that one wouldn't expect from the rest of the film. The effects utilized the limited technology of the day with a deft artistry. The 3D element (BTW, the DVD comes with a free pair of 3D glasses; a nice bonus) didn't hit me all that strong. Maybe it was me. But despite this, the dream sequences made the film.I was also interested in the idea the film presented of exploring the depths of the human mind. Such ideas were rare for 50's grade B (or C) horror flicks. But The Mask wrestled with the idea in a way that was heroic in light of the limits of budget and talent. Somewhere, someone may have been trying to get an idea across and make a statement.There were also bonus previews of various lost films, serials, and advertisements that were just as hilarious as the bulk of the film.I gave this four starts partly because of the brilliant creativity of the dream sequences and partly because of the fact that the DVD as a whole was an eloquent relic of a bygone era. The demented innocence of the beginning of a headlong plunge into a spiritual emptiness that has since engulfed the whole of humanity. Yet, looking at it cannot help but bring a smile to our faces. Personally, I'm not the type to long for the ""good old days"". Nor am I much interested in current popular trends - which will doubtless go the way of the dinosaur and films like The Mask. My own ""now"" is far too interesting and fulfilling to live in such fantasy worlds. But an occasional visit to the ""Old Neighborhood"" is always refreshing, enjoyable, and puts things in a delightful perspective.",4,PUT THE MASK ON NOW!!!,1223424000,"10 8, 2008",2008,3142,"['saw', 'movie', 'TV', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'much', 'younger', 'recall', 'up', 'eyebrows', 'refreshments', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'finally', 'DVD', 'HAD', 'get', 'copy', 'was', 'time', 'fairly', 'original', 'idea', 'old', 'friend', 'Greg', 'Horn', 'see', 'review', 'said', 'obvious', 'where', 'idea', 'comic', 'book', 'Jim', 'Carry', 'movie', 'originated.Well', 'flaws', 'movie', 'certainly', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'flaws', 'were', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'director', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'strong', 'medication', 'probably', 'offset', 'tiny', 'budget', 'third', 'rate', 'actors', 'was', 'forced', 'work', 'lost', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'script', 'referred', 'being', 'night', 'i.e', 'psychiatrist', 'driving', 'car', 'picking', 'up', 'secretary', 'whom', 'was', 'banging', 'fiance', 'back', 'broad', 'daylight', 'parking', 'car', 'telling', 'Look', 'stars', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', 'shrink', 'driven', 'mad', 'mask', 'dour', 'half-baked', 'looking', 'police', 'detective', 'was', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'pathetic', 'parody', 'karate', 'chop', 'shoulder', 'finally', 'subdued', 'hapless', 'lunatic', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'holes', 'plot', 'keep', 'track', 'taking', 'notes', 'EVERYBODY', 'was', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'was', 'tomorrow', 'was', 'dream', 'sequences', 'accompanying', 'music', 'really', 'made', 'film', 'sequences', 'were', 'directed', 'Slavko', 'Vorkapich', 'knew', 'where', 'loin', 'share', 'film', 'budget', 'went', 'scenes', 'were', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'feeling', 'fear', 'nightmarish', 'surrealism', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'rest', 'film', 'effects', 'utilized', 'limited', 'technology', 'day', 'deft', 'artistry', '3D', 'element', 'BTW', 'DVD', 'free', 'pair', '3D', 'glasses', 'nice', 'bonus', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'strong', 'Maybe', 'was', 'dream', 'sequences', 'made', 'film.I', 'was', 'also', 'interested', 'idea', 'film', 'presented', 'exploring', 'depths', 'human', 'mind', 'Such', 'ideas', 'were', 'rare', '50', 'grade', 'B', 'C', 'horror', 'flicks', 'Mask', 'wrestled', 'idea', 'way', 'was', 'heroic', 'light', 'limits', 'budget', 'talent', 'Somewhere', 'someone', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'get', 'idea', 'across', 'make', 'statement.There', 'were', 'also', 'bonus', 'previews', 'various', 'lost', 'films', 'serials', 'advertisements', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'hilarious', 'bulk', 'film.I', 'gave', 'four', 'starts', 'partly', 'brilliant', 'creativity', 'dream', 'sequences', 'partly', 'fact', 'DVD', 'whole', 'was', 'eloquent', 'relic', 'bygone', 'era', 'demented', 'innocence', 'beginning', 'headlong', 'plunge', 'spiritual', 'emptiness', 'engulfed', 'whole', 'humanity', 'looking', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'bring', 'smile', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'not', 'type', 'long', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'am', 'much', 'interested', 'current', 'popular', 'trends', 'will', 'doubtless', 'go', 'way', 'dinosaur', 'films', 'Mask', 'own', 'now', 'far', 'too', 'interesting', 'fulfilling', 'live', 'such', 'fantasy', 'worlds', 'occasional', 'visit', 'Old', 'Neighborhood', 'always', 'refreshing', 'enjoyable', 'things', 'delightful', 'perspective']",N/A

But THE MASK has two things going it for it: it has 3D and a cheap purchase price.  The entire film seems to have been created purely in order accomodate the 3D effects.  A psychiatrist (Allan Barnes) has a homicidal archeologist patient who swears up and down that he was just fine until he put on an ancient Indian mask the local museum dug up--and now, under the mask's influence, he has fearful fantasies, nasty nightmares, and (dare I say it?) the urge to kill.  Our intrepid analyst doesn't believe a word of it, so the archeologist goes home and kills himself... but not before mailing the mask off to the doctor who failed him.  Does the doctor put on the mask?  Since we've only gotten about fifteen minutes into the movie he darn well better.Each time the doctor puts on the mask he has the same fearsome fantasies and nasty nightmares as his deceased patient--only now we see them, and THEY ARE IN 3D!  Now, the video comes with all sorts of warnings that everything from visual impairments to bad color settings on your screen will affect the effect, so you're pretty much on your own here.  For myself, I found it worked pretty well as long as you were watching the movie in a pitch black room.  But the fact that the movie is sometimes in 2D and sometimes in 3D has a peculiar result: its fun to put the glasses on and off, but it takes a few minutes for you to begin to read the film as 3D, and then when you taken the glasses off to see the 2D part you feel slightly askew because you're still sorta seeing red out of one eye and blue out of the other.Several reviewers have commented that they found parts of the film pretty creepy and the 3D sequences really imaginative.  I myself thought the whole thing was about as frightening as a box of dry cereal and the 3D bits--they were fun enough, but let's face it, this aint no CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON.  And unlike another reviewer, who said he got FIVE sets of glasses with the video, I only got TWO, and that sorta killed any ideas I had for using the film as a party flick.  Still, the ten-to-fourteen year old crowd will get a kick out of it, and it's all just silly enough for grown ups to find mildly amusing too.

My review will be updated when I get the disc, but for now I'll comment on the movie itself and not the disc quality.FWIW this was also known as Eyes of Hell, it is a 1961 low-budget Canadian horror film produced in 3-D by Warner Bros.This is a really great B horror flick. One of those Friday night Shock Theater gems for sure.  The 3-D sequences, four in all, last only a few minutes each. They were designed by montage expert Slavko Vorkapich, and feature an array of distinctively psychedelic visuals, some of which are mildly gruesome. A crude electronic music score enhances the strangeness of the 3-D scenes.The movie is well done considering it's low budget, the story concerns a young scientist who obtains a mysterious ancient tribal mask. Whenever he puts on the mask he experiences weird dream-like visions which become increasingly disturbing and violent. The visions begin to alter his personality, and eventually drive him insane! Wee, what great Friday night fun! Pretty obvious where the later comic book and Jim Carry movie plot line came from.UPDATE: As far as the disc quality, it's good, very watchable for a budget film, don't expect a flawless presentation as I'm pretty sure no master exists that would be better than this disc.

As you probably already know only small parts of the movie are in 3D, but those parts are completely different from the main movie because they are psychedelic dream fantasies that appear only after the movie character puts on his mask (and you put on yours).  It made a lasting impression in my little ten-year-old brain and I longed over the decades to see in again.This DVD presents the movie just as I remembered it.  My DVD came with only one pair of plain white cardboard 3D glasses and were folded wrong with the red lens on the right which then turns the 3D effect inside out making things that are supposed to pop out, recede instead.  And that brings me to my main gripe with 3D movies in general, even those being made today.  People have misunderstood the 3D effect from the very first movies.  Look at the antique stereoscopes or even the 3D Viewmaster slides and you will notice that their approach to using 3D was 180 degrees from every 3D movie made in that 3D is actually a BIG BOX that you look into, (and despite all efforts and propagandized exclamations to the contrary), the audience never has the sensation that things are popping out of the screen.  Many people believe that they had to duck whenever the big stick was pointed at the camera because they were told to, but if they really look at the picture they will see that the big stick doesn't pop out but rather, the background recedes toward the horizon and the attempt just creates a fuzzy two-headed thing floating about the screen.  This `Comin' at Ya approach is somewhat clownish in effect unless handled carefully.  Just look at movies that were filmed in 3D but later released in 2D.  Exaggerated angles of various gestures and props seem like those used in the silent films 100 years ago.There was one other thing.  All these years I remembered the movie ending with an explanation that the mask, although 500 years old, had a narcotic in it that was injected into the wearer with little barbs whenever it was put on over the head.  This DVD does not have any ending like that at all and I wonder if all this time I was superimposing that ending from another movie onto this one, or was it edited off the end of this DVD version?",5,The Big Box,1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,2549,"['Mask', '3DI', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', '1961', 'was', 'experience', 'never', 'forgot', 'had', 'seen', '3D', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'different', 'not', 'just', 'was', 'so', 'modern', 'style', 'mean', 'was', 'about', 'common', 'normal', 'looking', 'people', 'instead', 'glamorous', 'Hollywood-ized', 'stars', '3D', 'sequences', 'were', 'unforgettable', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'only', 'small', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', '3D', 'parts', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'main', 'movie', 'are', 'psychedelic', 'dream', 'fantasies', 'appear', 'only', 'movie', 'character', 'mask', 'put', 'yours', 'made', 'lasting', 'impression', 'little', 'ten-year-old', 'brain', 'longed', 'decades', 'see', 'again.This', 'DVD', 'movie', 'just', 'remembered', 'DVD', 'came', 'only', 'one', 'pair', 'plain', 'white', 'cardboard', '3D', 'glasses', 'were', 'folded', 'wrong', 'red', 'lens', 'right', 'then', '3D', 'effect', 'making', 'things', 'are', 'supposed', 'pop', 'out', 'recede', 'instead', 'main', 'gripe', '3D', 'movies', 'general', 'even', 'being', 'made', 'today', 'People', 'have', 'misunderstood', '3D', 'effect', 'very', 'first', 'movies', 'Look', 'antique', 'stereoscopes', 'even', '3D', 'Viewmaster', 'slides', 'will', 'notice', 'approach', 'using', '3D', 'was', '180', 'degrees', '3D', 'movie', 'made', '3D', 'actually', 'BIG', 'BOX', 'look', 'efforts', 'propagandized', 'exclamations', 'contrary', 'audience', 'never', 'sensation', 'things', 'are', 'popping', 'screen', 'Many', 'people', 'believe', 'had', 'duck', 'whenever', 'big', 'stick', 'was', 'pointed', 'camera', 'were', 'told', 'really', 'look', 'picture', 'will', 'see', 'big', 'stick', ""n't"", 'pop', 'out', 'rather', 'background', 'horizon', 'attempt', 'just', 'fuzzy', 'two-headed', 'thing', 'floating', 'screen', 'Comin', 'Ya', 'approach', 'somewhat', 'clownish', 'effect', 'handled', 'carefully', 'Just', 'look', 'movies', 'were', 'filmed', '3D', 'later', 'released', '2D', 'Exaggerated', 'angles', 'various', 'gestures', 'props', 'seem', 'used', 'silent', 'films', '100', 'years', 'ago.There', 'was', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'years', 'remembered', 'movie', 'ending', 'explanation', 'mask', '500', 'years', 'old', 'had', 'narcotic', 'was', 'injected', 'wearer', 'little', 'barbs', 'whenever', 'was', 'put', 'head', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'ending', 'wonder', 'time', 'was', 'superimposing', 'ending', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'edited', 'off', 'end', 'DVD', 'version']",N/A

The idea is that when anyone wears the ancient tribal mask (which looks like a decorated skull) they experience strange hallucinations and they become increasingly neurotic and violent.  Wearing the mask is like an addiction, once tried they have to keep returning to it.  The three bizarre 3D sequences are introduced in an effectively corny way - as a voice tells the man in the film to ""put on the mask now"" the viewer puts on her/his mask (ie 3D glasses).  When the film was first released the glasses were shaped and decorated like a mask.  So the film is an inventive piece of harmless hokey fun with appropriately strange 3D inserts.  However, I found the image in this DVD release quite soft, and although the 3D works quite well (given the process and the variations in viewer's tv screens) I don't think it's as crisp as the Video release from a few years back.  I don't know why this should be - it seems to me there really is no excuse for a DVD not being the best ever quality, even if it's taken from a 35mm print.  These films were projected onto huge screens in cinemas, so why don't they look wonderful on our home screens?
