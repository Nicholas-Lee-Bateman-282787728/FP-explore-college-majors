952614,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000BYA4JW,andy8047,"[3, 5]","NBC's The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air began its third season in September 1992. Fans of NBC sitcoms no longer had The Cosby Show to watch except on independent stations that syndicate it. They also had one more season of Cheers to watch also. They also at least saw the premiere episode of Mad About You. And of course,they had TFPOBA. TFPOBA star Will Smith just finished filming the Warner Bros. comedy MADE IN AMERICA(his debut) with Cheers star Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg. Smith,also a rapper,continued recording albums throughout the series with his partner ""D.J. Jazzy Jeff"" Townes. After this season,TFPOBA continued for three more seasons and then,Smith personally pulled the plug on the series to concentrate on his film career which is still going strong today. Also,there would be no more schedule conflict amongst the series and the films. Some of the episodes were directed by Debbie Allen. Allen,a singer and actress also,previously worked for NBC,starring on the drama Fame,inspired by the 1980 MGM/UA musical film which she also appeared in. She also guest-starred on a TCS episode in 1988,working with her sister Phylicia Rashad,who was Clair Hanks Huxtable.",5,The Fresh Prince still rocks!,1134086400,"12 9, 2005",2005,1175,"['NBC', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel', 'Air', 'began', 'third', 'season', 'September', '1992', 'Fans', 'NBC', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'watch', 'independent', 'stations', 'syndicate', 'also', 'had', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'Cheers', 'watch', 'also', 'also', 'least', 'saw', 'premiere', 'episode', 'Mad', 'course', 'had', 'TFPOBA', 'TFPOBA', 'star', 'Will', 'Smith', 'just', 'finished', 'filming', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'comedy', 'MADE', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'debut', 'Cheers', 'star', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Smith', 'also', 'rapper', 'continued', 'recording', 'albums', 'series', 'partner', 'D.J', 'Jazzy', 'Jeff', 'Townes', 'season', 'TFPOBA', 'continued', 'three', 'more', 'seasons', 'then', 'Smith', 'personally', 'pulled', 'plug', 'series', 'concentrate', 'film', 'career', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'today', 'Also', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'schedule', 'conflict', 'amongst', 'series', 'films', 'episodes', 'were', 'directed', 'Debbie', 'Allen', 'Allen', 'singer', 'actress', 'also', 'previously', 'worked', 'NBC', 'starring', 'drama', 'Fame', 'inspired', '1980', 'MGM/UA', 'musical', 'film', 'also', 'appeared', 'also', 'guest-starred', 'TCS', 'episode', '1988', 'working', 'sister', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'who', 'was', 'Clair', 'Hanks', 'Huxtable']",The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: Season 3

Will's returned from his summer vacation in Philly with a new look & demeanor that doesn't bode well with Uncle Phil. In ""Here Comes The Judge"", Will gets arrested for getting numerous outstanding parking tickets, & Phil hires an ex-convict under Will's recommendation in ""Robbing The Banks"", & soon comes to regret it. Will & Carlton have a run-in with guest-star Riddick Bowe in ""You Bet Your Life"" when their car breaks down en route to Las Vegas, while Carlton is depressed about not getting accepted into Princeton, so his guardian angel in the form of guest-star Tom Jones shows up in the episode ""The Alma Matter"". Will & Carlton play a prank on Geoffrey via a fake lottery ticket in ""Winner Takes Off"", & Vivian has a baby in ""Bundle of Joy"" - where everyone seems to be delighted except Ashley. Carlton's former girlfriend visits him with a surprise, a baby daughter, in ""Mama's Baby Carlton's Maybe"" - featuring guest-star Lark Voorhies (""Saved by the Bell""). A girl at school showers Will with expensive gifts in ""P.S., I Love You"". Phil goes up against his former mentor Judge Robertson (played by Sherman Hemsley) in the same episode. The Bankses are invited to appear on the Oprah Winfrey Show in ""A Night At The Oprah"" - except Will that is. Phil loses to Judge Robertson in the election in ""Asses To Ashes"". As you can see, there are plenty of hilarious & dramatic moments during this Third Season of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"". There would be one major cast change after this season - Janet Hubert-Whitten would leave at season's end & was replaced by Daphne Maxwell-Reid in the role of Vivian the following season. With that transitional change to come, make sure you purchase ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air - The Complete Third Season"" for your DVD library today!R.I.P., Sherman Hemsley (Judge Robertson).",5,"""...on the playground is where I spent most of my days...""",1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,1991,"['Third', 'Season', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel-Air', 'finds', 'Will', 'getting', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'Phil', 'Vivian', 'season', 'opener', 'How', 'Spent', 'My', 'Summer', 'Vacation', 'Will', 'returned', 'summer', 'vacation', 'Philly', 'new', 'look', 'demeanor', ""n't"", 'bode', 'well', 'Uncle', 'Phil', 'Here', 'Judge', 'Will', 'arrested', 'getting', 'numerous', 'outstanding', 'parking', 'tickets', 'Phil', 'ex-convict', 'Will', 'recommendation', 'Robbing', 'Banks', 'soon', 'regret', 'Will', 'Carlton', 'have', 'run-in', 'guest-star', 'Riddick', 'Bowe', 'Bet', 'Life', 'when', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'en', 'route', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Carlton', 'depressed', 'not', 'getting', 'accepted', 'Princeton', 'guardian', 'angel', 'form', 'guest-star', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'up', 'episode', 'Alma', 'Matter', 'Will', 'Carlton', 'play', 'prank', 'Geoffrey', 'fake', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'Winner', 'Takes', 'Off', 'Vivian', 'baby', 'Bundle', 'Joy', 'where', 'everyone', 'be', 'delighted', 'Ashley', 'Carlton', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'surprise', 'baby', 'daughter', 'Mama', 'Baby', 'Carlton', 'Maybe', 'featuring', 'guest-star', 'Lark', 'Voorhies', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'girl', 'school', 'showers', 'Will', 'expensive', 'gifts', 'P.S.', 'Love', 'Phil', 'up', 'former', 'mentor', 'Judge', 'Robertson', 'played', 'Sherman', 'Hemsley', 'same', 'episode', 'Bankses', 'are', 'invited', 'appear', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'Show', 'A', 'Night', 'Oprah', 'except', 'Will', 'Phil', 'Judge', 'Robertson', 'election', 'Asses', 'Ashes', 'can', 'see', 'are', 'plenty', 'hilarious', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'Third', 'Season', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel-Air', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'major', 'cast', 'change', 'season', 'Janet', 'Hubert-Whitten', 'would', 'leave', 'season', 'end', 'was', 'replaced', 'Daphne', 'Maxwell-Reid', 'role', 'Vivian', 'following', 'season', 'transitional', 'change', 'come', 'make', 'sure', 'purchase', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel-Air', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Season', 'DVD', 'library', 'today', 'R.I.P.', 'Sherman', 'Hemsley', 'Judge', 'Robertson']",The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: Season 3

The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air the Complete Third Season arrives in stores on February 14th. The colorful four DVD box set includes 24 episodes from the shows third season. Season three premiered in the fall of 1992 and wrapped up in May of 1993.Watching these episodes will take you back to the early 90's. Remember bright clothes and big hats? What about beepers? Those little devices which were so important in the early 90's have now been replaced by Sidekicks, Blackberry's and cell phones. Here is a brief round up of season three. Janet Hubert-Whitten was still in her role as Aunt Viv. Fans of the show will recall in later seasons the role was taken over by Daphne Maxwell Reid. Will is still in high school and will graduate at seasons end. His mother will try to persuade will back to the East Coast, but our heroine decides that Cali is his home. Hilary tries out a new career as a weather girl. She isn't the only person in the Banks family trying out a new career. This is the season in which Uncle Phil runs for Superior Court. Aunt Viv also becomes pregnant during the season. There are also a slew of special guest stars who appear during the season including Larenz Tate, Lark Voorhies and Garcelle Beauvais.The season opens with the episode ""How I Spent My Summer Vacation."" This episode once again visits the familiar theme of culture shock between the Bel-Air banks and Philadelphia Will. After returning from a summer in Philly will has a new vocabulary of slang, dread loc twists, and a beeper much to the dismay of Uncle Phil. After clashing with Uncle Phil at a function, Will leaves the Banks home. Of course he returns for a continued season of laughs and hijinks.Another neat season 3 episode is ""Will Gets Committed."" The Banks family decides to give back to the community. While they are doing community service they network with old friends and visit the small apartment they lived in before Phil became a high paid lawyer. The Banks family (and the kids) are seen in a flashback years earlier with different actors in the core role.The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air The Complete Third Season arrives in stores on February 14th. Special features include ""Best of the Upper Bel-Air Crust,"" which includes Season 3 highlights and Bel-Air bloopers.

Three seasons down and the Uncle Phil fat jokes still aren't old!  This season focuses heavily on the kids of the family.  Hilary, Carlton, Ashley, and of course Will.  Will and Carlton are seniors in high school and thinking about where they are going to head off to college.  Bel-Air Prep has gone co-ed meaning that Ashley is now amongst the boys and striving not only to get noticed by her female peers, but by her male ones as well.  Hilary is urged to move out and to find a job.  All of them are struggling to find themselves and to figure out what they want in life.Although the focus is on the kids, there is still a heavy influence of humor coming from familial struggles and the ever-present social views of African Americans in our society.  Even though this was written and performed in the 90s, most of the material is still relevant to today's adults, teenagers, and the families they come from.My one dislike are two episodes farther on in this season that are nearly on top of each other that are basically filler segments with many flashbacks.  To have one per season is fine, but to have two is overdoing it just a little.

Will, however, suspects that the inexperienced Carlton never had a chance to father a baby. Determined to accept his responsibility, Carlton elopes with Cindy to a small-town chapel. While waiting for the preacher to marry them, they realize that they're too young and too incompatible to spend the rest of their lives together. When Will arrives at the chapel to stop the ceremony, he learns that Cindy has confessed that Carlton wasn't the baby's father and called her parents to take her home, leaving Carlton bewildered and heartbroken. Carlton meekly confesses to Will that he's still a virgin, but was willing to marry Cindy, hoping that someday she'd learn to love him in return.55. P.S.

952636,A3INQQEX56YKJV,B000BYA4JW,PSF,"[0, 0]","Season 3 marks the end of an era for The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air.  After three solid years as a main cast member, Janet Hubert-Whitten takes her final bow as Vivian Banks before show business politics overruled, resulting in her being sadly let go from her role by the producers.  That unfortunate reality aside, Season 3 provides just as much humor, warmth, positivity, seriousness, and family values as Seasons 1 and 2.  All the characters maintain their charm and wit from the first to the last episode.Highlights of this season include ""A Night At The Oprah"" (that episode will have you howling with the laughter from the opening fade-in to the closing blooper reel); ""Mommy Nearest"" (the quote by Will's aunt on his mom's side of the family upon seeing her other sister and her Caucasian brother-in-law getting on so well as a married couple, 'That's it, I'm gettin' me a White man!' is worth the full 23 minutes alone); ""Winner Takes Off"" (Geoffrey wins the lottery and sticks it to the spoiled Banks Family under whom he works [Geoffrey's character gets more sarcastic during Season 3--increasing his/Joseph Marcell's comedic grace]); ""The Baby Comes Out"" (probably the most intensely dramatic episode in the entire series [Janet Hubert-Whitten's real-life pregnancy during the filming of Season 3 was an underlying premise for the show that year]); ""The Alma Matter"" (Will exercises his academic expertise [a la Bel-Air Prep Academy] to unwittingly gain acceptance into Princeton University, much to Carlton's dismay--as he doesn't even get his foot in the door, literally).Quite honestly, there are too many great episodes to describe here.  But the aforementioned definitely rank among the Top 10!  And Season 3 ranks among the best years of The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air.  As Will and Carlton look ahead to their academic future, Uncle Phil runs for Superior Court Judge, Hilary gets a new job as a weather reporter and meets her soon-to-be ill-fated fiancee, Trevor, Ashley dives deeper into the world of adolescence, Vivian gives birth to her fourth child on the show, Jeffrey makes due with his lackluster life, the Banks household falls nowhere short of hilarity, pleasure, and depth.
