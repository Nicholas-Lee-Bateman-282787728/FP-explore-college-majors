As a matter of fact I was expecting a dud because in my opinion I think Nicholas Cage's career has been on the downturn with some of his latest movies.  I was suprised with Matchstick Men, it was very enjoyable from beginning to the extremely suprising end.  It is a humorous movie that is also a smart and slick con movie as well.Nicholas Cage and his partner Sam Rockwell make a living off of being con artists.  They are quite successful at their line of work.  The two of them make a great team and they have great chemistry.  Cage's character also has obsessive compulsive disorder and he is always cleaning stuff.  He can't really function without his meds. and that plays a role in this movie as well.  Part way through the movie Cage's character finds out he has a teenage daughter he had about 15 years ago.  To cut things short.  They reunite, shes happy, they argue, she thinks he's a bad father, he tells her he makes a living is a con artist, shes intrigued and wants to become a con artist as well.  I will leave the rest to you to find out what else happens in this suprising and twisting movie.I like some of Ridley Scotts movies but this one really stands out in my opinion.  I enjoyed movies he made like Alien &amp; Gladiator but Matchstick Men is another great movie that when you think Ridley Scott hopefully this movie will come to thought as well.  There are alot of con movies come out every year but Matchstick Men stands out in that crowd.  If you enjoyed other recent movies like Confidence or Oceans Eleven you are going to love this movie.With all honesty I mean it when I say Matchstick Men is one of last years best movies. It combines humor, a bit of action, and plot twists along the way.  Give this movie a try if you like Nicolas Cage in what I think is one of his best roles and movies he's played since Leaving Las Vegas.",4,One of the best movies of 2003,1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,1921,"['few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'matter', 'fact', 'was', 'expecting', 'dud', 'opinion', 'think', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'career', 'been', 'downturn', 'latest', 'movies', 'was', 'suprised', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'beginning', 'extremely', 'suprising', 'end', 'humorous', 'movie', 'also', 'smart', 'slick', 'con', 'movie', 'well.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'partner', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'make', 'living', 'being', 'con', 'artists', 'are', 'quite', 'successful', 'line', 'work', 'two', 'make', 'great', 'team', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Cage', 'character', 'also', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'disorder', 'always', 'cleaning', 'stuff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'function', 'meds', 'role', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Part', 'way', 'movie', 'Cage', 'character', 'out', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'had', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'cut', 'things', 'short', 'reunite', 'shes', 'happy', 'argue', 'bad', 'father', 'living', 'con', 'artist', 'shes', 'intrigued', 'become', 'con', 'artist', 'well', 'will', 'leave', 'rest', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'else', 'suprising', 'twisting', 'movie.I', 'Ridley', 'Scotts', 'movies', 'one', 'really', 'out', 'opinion', 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'made', 'Alien', 'amp', 'Gladiator', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'great', 'movie', 'when', 'think', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'hopefully', 'movie', 'will', 'come', 'thought', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'alot', 'con', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'out', 'crowd', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'recent', 'movies', 'Confidence', 'Oceans', 'Eleven', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'movie.With', 'honesty', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'one', 'last', 'years', 'best', 'movies', 'humor', 'bit', 'action', 'plot', 'twists', 'way', 'Give', 'movie', 'try', 'like', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'what', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'movies', 'played', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas']",N/A

791653,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00012QLAA,Alex Udvary,"[1, 2]","Although the public responded moderately to this film (it grossed a little over 36 million), the critics sure did love this Ridley Scott (&quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;) con artist movie.&quot;Matchstick Men&quot; has Nicolas Cage playing Roy Waller, a great con artist, but one messed up person. Waller is full of neuroses among his biggest problems is the fact he suffers from a major case of OCD.&quot;Matchstick Men&quot; has a lot of plus sides to it. Cage, as most have already stated turns in a wonderful performance. He's alive and viberant. And it's a shame he didn't receive an Academy Award nomination, he's THAT good. Also Sam Rockwell does a nice job. The two have a lot of chemistry, both are fun to watch. As are some of the cons. Which really makes a movie like this. But, &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; is playing around with a couple of ideas. One deals with Roy (Cage) and Frank Mercer (Rockwell) as a couple of con artist. The other deals with Roy as a man who makes Woody Allen seem tame. And the third story has Roy coming to realize he has a 14 year old daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman). All of these outlines work well, at times, but the main problem I had with the film was the fact I was able to predict the ending. Any con moie you watch, you always know to expect a big twist at the end. That's just the way these films work. Watch Mamet films like &quot;Heist&quot;, &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot;, &quot;House of Games&quot; watch other movies like &quot;The Grifter&quot; and even the recent &quot;Confidence&quot;. So knowing that &quot;rule&quot; it was easy to guess what would happen. &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; as I said does have its strong points but here's an odd case where a movie has a good execution but a so-so set-up. What I mean by that is the acting is fine, Scott's directing works, I liked the cinematography by John Mathieson, and at moments (mostly the first 45 minutes are so) the screenplay by Nicholas and Ted Griffin is enjoyable, but then the film becomes predictable. Or maybe it's predictable to a small number of people since film critic Roger Ebert openly said he did not see the ending coming. If he was lying or not I don't know.So should you see this movie? Yes. I've named all of the film's appealing points. &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; also keeps up Scott's winning record with me, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Hannibal&quot;, &amp; &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;. This is a fun movie to watch, just remember, don't make the same mistake I did, and think about it too much. You'll spoil it for yourself.Bottom-line: Entertaining con movie from Ridley Scott, that may not reach the level of other con films. Has strong performances from Cage, Rockwell, and Lohman. The only downfall to the movie is the predictable ending. Still worthwhile though.",3,These &quot;Matches&quot; Cause A Small Flame,1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,2815,"['public', 'responded', 'moderately', 'film', 'grossed', 'little', '36', 'million', 'critics', 'sure', 'did', 'love', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'quot', 'Gladiator', 'quot', 'quot', 'Alien', 'quot', 'con', 'artist', 'movie.', 'quot', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'quot', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'playing', 'Roy', 'Waller', 'great', 'con', 'artist', 'one', 'messed', 'up', 'person', 'Waller', 'full', 'neuroses', 'biggest', 'problems', 'fact', 'major', 'case', 'OCD.', 'quot', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'quot', 'lot', 'sides', 'Cage', 'most', 'have', 'already', 'stated', 'turns', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'alive', 'viberant', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'good', 'Also', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'nice', 'job', 'two', 'have', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'cons', 'Which', 'really', 'movie', 'quot', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'quot', 'playing', 'around', 'couple', 'ideas', 'One', 'deals', 'Roy', 'Cage', 'Frank', 'Mercer', 'Rockwell', 'couple', 'con', 'artist', 'other', 'deals', 'Roy', 'man', 'who', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'seem', 'tame', 'third', 'story', 'Roy', 'coming', 'realize', '14', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Angela', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'outlines', 'work', 'well', 'times', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'able', 'predict', 'ending', 'con', 'moie', 'watch', 'always', 'know', 'expect', 'big', 'twist', 'end', 'just', 'way', 'films', 'work', 'Watch', 'Mamet', 'films', 'quot', 'Heist', 'quot', 'quot', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'quot', 'quot', 'House', 'Games', 'quot', 'watch', 'other', 'movies', 'quot', 'Grifter', 'quot', 'even', 'recent', 'quot', 'Confidence', 'quot', 'knowing', 'quot', 'rule', 'quot', 'was', 'easy', 'guess', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'quot', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'quot', 'said', 'have', 'strong', 'points', 'here', 'odd', 'case', 'where', 'movie', 'good', 'execution', 'so-so', 'set-up', 'What', 'mean', 'acting', 'fine', 'Scott', 'directing', 'liked', 'cinematography', 'John', 'Mathieson', 'moments', 'mostly', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'are', 'so', 'screenplay', 'Nicholas', 'Ted', 'Griffin', 'enjoyable', 'then', 'film', 'predictable', 'predictable', 'small', 'number', 'people', 'film', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'openly', 'said', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'was', 'lying', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.So', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'named', 'film', 'appealing', 'points', 'quot', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'quot', 'also', 'up', 'Scott', 'winning', 'record', 'quot', 'Gladiator', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hannibal', 'quot', 'amp', 'quot', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'quot', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'just', 'remember', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'did', 'think', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'spoil', 'yourself.Bottom-line', 'Entertaining', 'con', 'movie', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'may', 'not', 'reach', 'level', 'other', 'con', 'films', 'Has', 'strong', 'performances', 'Cage', 'Rockwell', 'Lohman', 'only', 'downfall', 'movie', 'predictable', 'ending', 'Still', 'worthwhile']",N/A

Nicholas plays a con guy who misleads people by tactful stealing, selling water filters promising fake gift certificates and non-existent shows. He make hell of money which he keeps in his bank locker. His protege is Sam Rockwell, a foul mouthed guy. Cage suffers from Panic attacks, Agoraphobia, OCD and his rituals involve cleaning, Counting 3 when closing and opening doors and also Trouttes syndrome. He takes treatment from a cocky psychiatrist. All of sudden his 14yr daughter brilliantly done by Lohman appears in his lonely life and he loves her though he starts of rather ackwardly.The father daughter relationship is so heartening and cute to watch. Cage teaches his daughter his con tricks and she gets involved in a big cheating episode. The melo-drama movie ends thrilling all of us. No spoilers here !Nicholas cage does very complex roles of being a con-man, father/daughter relationship and his Anxiety disorder with unbelievable ease. The film could have been easily spoiled and unrealistic but for his acting. He deserves Oscar for this. The ending finds his calm and mature man conquering his inner devils. Lohman is 25yrs old and it is unbelievable how she potrayed a 14yr old. She just looks like 14yr old unless we see her in the end of the movie where she is transformed. I wondered if it was a special effect ! She acts with effortless ease displaying teenage emotions of naughtiness, innocence, affection and bickering.

791657,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00012QLAA,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","I love Ridley Scott.  He is one of those directors who are capable of doing almost anything.  Sure, he has had some misfires in the past, and he will continue to have a few, but overall he has proven that he can sink into nearly any genre with ease and deliver something memorable.`Matchstick Men' is a light yet striking film that could stand tall with the best Scott has been able to produce.The film revolves around two con men, Roy and Frank, who find their operation flipped on its head with the sudden appearance of Angela.  This young teenager claims to be Roy's daughter.  This is news to him, but he learns to accept the possibility, and over time the two form a bond, especially when it becomes apparent that Angela possesses the same knack that Roy has for his `profession'.  Frank is less than thrilled about this new development, but he doesn't really have much of a say in the matter.Just wait for the twist!What I like so much about this film is that it possesses a light and airy vibe that suits the whole genre very well.  This is a `sting' film, a crime comedy that capitalizes on the swift humor to create a complete aura.  The visual style is very bleached, as if it has been sitting out in the sun too long.  I love that visual.  It's kind of like someone took the breezy feel of Woody Allen's `Vicky Cristina Barcelona' and baked it.I also give Scott credit for coaxing out of the cast some of their best work to date.  Everyone and their mother knows my dislike for Nicolas Cage.  He is such an unnatural actor.  That said, he has shone in films that capitalize on his ticks and force him to create something natural out of them.  This is one of his finest performances.  Using Roy's OCD as a building block, Cage actually creates a believable and engaging character in Roy.  Sam Rockwell is lauded by a lock of my cinephile friends, but I find him highly overrated.  Here he sinks into the dramedy aspect of the film effortlessly, and while it isn't a `standing ovation' type supporting role, he definitely `supports' the film very well.  Alison Lohman taps into Angela's soft side to great effect (it was needed to sell some of the more intimate aspects of her character development, and also that of Roy's).`Matchstick Men' is good breezy fun with a great (totally unexpected) twist that will leave you blindsided (and conflicted in your amusement).

It all works. This movie is so funny and likeable that I don't think many people can turn away from it's endearing charm and wit.Cage stars as Roy, a guy with a serious amount of nervous ticks and obsessive compulsive behaviors. He can never calm down-- it's like he's got caffeine for blood, which makes him a really fun character to be around for the couple hours the movie is. Roy is a con artist, pulling a big job with his partner Mark (Sam Rockwell-- who is absolutely amazing). Mark is annoyed that Roy can't even calm down when they're in the middle of a job so he tells Roy to see a shrink. Roy then learns he has a fourteen year old daughter, played by the magnificnet Allison Lohman. She's emotional, she smells like bubble gum, and she's in the way of Roy's life as a con artist.The ending really is too good for words. It surprised the heck out of me, that's for sure. I never saw it coming. There's certainly a sadness to it, but it works so well I can't hardly complain.Truly, this movie is worth watching. Cage playing a guy with so many ticks is irresistably funny, a tad annoying, and kind of sad all at the same time.

Thirty minutes into the movie, after we've met all the characters and understand all the situations that the movie is going to cover, the plot twist is incredibly obvious.  I watched the whole movie hoping that wouldn't be the case, but it was, and it ruins the movie.Minor Spoilers below.In Roger Ebert's review of this movie, he writes that the movie has 3 plot points.  &quot;It is: (1) the story of a crisis in the life of a man crippled by neurotic obsessions; (2) the story of two con men who happen onto a big score, and (3) the story of a man who meets the teenage daughter he never knew he had, and finds himself trying to care for her.I strongly disagree.  This movie is a story of a conman who meets his teenage daughter and tries to care for her and grow close to her.  That is all the movie is about.  Through getting to know his daughter, she gets involved in some of his cons.  But the father/daughter relationship is the center of the movie.The ending of Matchstick Men renders the entire movie meaningless.  I'm reminded of Vanilla Sky's ending which showed that Tom Cruise had dreamt the entire movie.  Similarly, in Matchstick Men, if nothing before the ending is real, then why should the movie matter, know matter how well it is made.I did think all of the acting was great, especially by Cage and Lohman.

Otherwise you're going to figure out the ending halfway into the movie.  Unfortunately, that's what happened to me with this film.  At two hours, it's about 20-30 minutes too long.  This extra length causes the film to drag in parts, which makes you start to think about the con in order to escape the boring bits, and then you have the &quot;aha!&quot; moment when you realize what's going to happen.

Although the ending was satisfactory logically,there was a hollow feeling in my stomach which I can not get rid of whenever I think about this film.The story twist that almost everybody mentioned, is not so unpredictable,but it is better not to try predicting anything if you want to enjoy the movie.If not for anything,the movie is worth seen for the acting and directing,although I'm not sure many people would want to see this movie twice.I give it 5 stars for very subjective reasons,and I will definitely watch it many more times,but you may want to catch this one on tv.",5,Simple but clever...Cage shines,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,2089,"['one', 'hardest', 'reviews', 'have', 'written', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'why', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'made', 'feel', 'way', 'did.The', 'plot', 'was', 'simple', 'movie', 'was', 'simple', 'especially', 'someone', 'Scott', 'story', 'twists', 'were', 'not', 'incredibly', 'surprising.But', 'movie', 'made', 'think', 'days', 'saw', 'usually', 'good', 'sign.This', 'story', 'Roy', 'Cage', 'con', 'man', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'disorder', 'many', 'other', 'problems.He', 'been', 'divorced', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'not', 'have', 'anyone', 'younger', 'partner', 'crime', 'Frank', 'Rockwell', '.However', 'when', 'find', 'out', '14', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'whom', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'existed', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'better', 'complicated', 'Roy.Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'fell', 'love', 'start', 'Cage', 'portrayal', 'Roy.This', 'was', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'years.He', 'really', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Roy', 'care', 'believe', 'him.Alison', 'Lohman', 'was', 'ok', 'too', 'find', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why.Rockwell', 'had', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'made', 'wish', 'more.Ridley', 'Scott', 'directing', 'was', 'felt', 'time', 'made', 'frame', 'movie', 'picture', 'can', 'hang', 'wall.The', 'color', 'light', 'usage', 'impressed', 'especially.For', 'matchstick', 'men', 'was', 'going', 'fine', 'last', 'quarter', 'where', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'things', 'went', 'exactly', 'way', 'was', 'hoping', 'would.The', 'cons', 'were', 'not', 'extremely', 'incredible', 'complicated', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'huge', 'ups', 'downs', 'sat', 'down', 'enjoyed', 'Cage', 'performance', 'ending', 'was', 'satisfactory', 'logically', 'was', 'hollow', 'feeling', 'stomach', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'rid', 'whenever', 'think', 'film.The', 'story', 'twist', 'almost', 'everybody', 'mentioned', 'not', 'so', 'unpredictable', 'better', 'not', 'try', 'predicting', 'anything', 'want', 'enjoy', 'movie.If', 'not', 'anything', 'movie', 'worth', 'seen', 'acting', 'directing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'very', 'subjective', 'reasons', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'may', 'want', 'catch', 'one', 'tv']",N/A

As soon as I saw that Nicolas Cage was playing a con man with OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) I thought it would get tedious in no time, but Cage handled it well. OCD was an important aspect of his character, and it also influenced the outcome. Cage won an Oscar for playing an alcoholic who is ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and his performance here is up near that level. He really has a knack for playing afflicted characters.Sam Rockwell, as Frank, his partner, was pretty good; but Alison Lohman, as his daughter, Angela, was spectacular. There are tender moments between the daughter and her estranged father that are really touching, and that is hard to do. How easily it becomes cloying if handled wrong. Alison as Angela was very believable as the daughter, who has inherited her father's gift for grift.Matchstick Men continually surprises, and that is good. Nothing is as it seems, and there are some really clever twists. Ridley Scott, who directed Blade Runner, really knows his business. There was great choices of music throughout. Frank Sinatra, The Tijuana Brass, Nino Rota, Bobby Darin, Roxy Music, Kid Rock, and more. Each song was carefully chosen and placed so it commented on the action, but didn't really draw attention to itself and away from the story, because it just seemed so right for the moment.Bottomline is Matchstick Men is a good film from Ridley Scott, but it is not as good asBlade Runner (The Director's Cut). It has a great performance from Nicolas Cage, but not quite as good as Leaving Las Vegas.The Griftersis a better movie about con artistry, and Matchstick Men is not quite that good, but it comes very close. It beats The Flim Flam Man.SELECTED FILMS AND ROLES OF NICOLAS CAGEGhost Rider (Widescreen Edition)(2007) Nicolas Cage was Johnny Blaze / Ghost RiderAdaptation (Superbit Collection)(2002) Nicolas Cage was Charlie Kaufman / Donald KaufmanLeaving Las Vegas(1995) Nicolas Cage was Ben SandersonHoneymoon in Vegas(1992) Nicolas Cage was Jack SingerWild At Heart(1990) Nicolas Cage was Sailor RipleyValley Girl(1983) Nicolas Cage was RandySELECTED ROLES OF OTHER CAST MEMBERSChoke(2008) Sam Rockwell was Victor ManciniDrag Me to Hell(2009) Alison Lohman was Christine Brown-----------------------------Roy: For some people, money is... money is a foreign film without subtitles.==================================",4,"For some people, money is... money is a foreign film without subtitles",1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,2420,"['Matchstick', 'Men', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'As', 'soon', 'saw', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'was', 'playing', 'con', 'man', 'OCD', 'Obsessive', 'Compulsive', 'Disorder', 'thought', 'would', 'get', 'tedious', 'time', 'Cage', 'handled', 'well', 'OCD', 'was', 'important', 'aspect', 'character', 'also', 'influenced', 'outcome', 'Cage', 'won', 'Oscar', 'playing', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'performance', 'here', 'up', 'level', 'really', 'knack', 'playing', 'afflicted', 'characters.Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Frank', 'partner', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'daughter', 'Angela', 'was', 'spectacular', 'are', 'tender', 'moments', 'daughter', 'estranged', 'father', 'are', 'really', 'touching', 'hard', 'do', 'How', 'easily', 'cloying', 'handled', 'wrong', 'Alison', 'Angela', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'daughter', 'who', 'inherited', 'father', 'gift', 'grift.Matchstick', 'Men', 'continually', 'good', 'Nothing', 'are', 'really', 'clever', 'twists', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'who', 'directed', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'really', 'business', 'was', 'great', 'choices', 'music', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Tijuana', 'Brass', 'Nino', 'Rota', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Roxy', 'Music', 'Kid', 'Rock', 'more', 'song', 'was', 'carefully', 'chosen', 'placed', 'commented', 'action', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'draw', 'attention', 'away', 'story', 'just', 'seemed', 'so', 'right', 'moment.Bottomline', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'good', 'film', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'asBlade', 'Runner', 'Director', 'Cut', 'great', 'performance', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas.The', 'Griftersis', 'better', 'movie', 'con', 'artistry', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'not', 'quite', 'good', 'very', 'close', 'Flim', 'Flam', 'Man.SELECTED', 'FILMS', 'AND', 'ROLES', 'OF', 'NICOLAS', 'CAGEGhost', 'Rider', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '2007', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', '/', 'Ghost', 'RiderAdaptation', 'Superbit', 'Collection', '2002', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'was', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', '/', 'Donald', 'KaufmanLeaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', '1995', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'was', 'Ben', 'SandersonHoneymoon', 'Vegas', '1992', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'was', 'Jack', 'SingerWild', 'Heart', '1990', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'was', 'Sailor', 'RipleyValley', 'Girl', '1983', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'was', 'RandySELECTED', 'ROLES', 'OTHER', 'CAST', 'MEMBERSChoke', '2008', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'was', 'Victor', 'ManciniDrag', 'Me', 'Hell', '2009', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'was', 'Christine', 'Brown', '-Roy', 'people', 'money', 'money', 'foreign', 'film', 'subtitles.==================================']",N/A
791671,A2FS38D943KX12,B00012QLAA,chefdevergue,"[15, 16]","""Matchstick Men"" may not have been a box office success (compare it to the total gross of ""National Treasure"" [Cage's next film] and ""Kingdom of Heaven"" [Scott's next film]), but it certainly is one of the better-crafted & better-acted films to be associated with either of these men.  I was beginning to wonder if Cage could ever repeat a performance like what he did in ""Leaving Las Vegas.""  While his obsessive-compulsive con-man may not be the disaster along the lines of a suicidal alcoholic, he comes close with the impact he makes on the viewer.  This could easily have veered into caricature, but Cage creates a creditable & believable obsessive-compulsive.Perhaps this could be classified as a comedy, but it has an awfully bittersweet quality to it which makes the movie difficult to categorize with any ease.  The characters of Roy & Angela (a very very good performance by Alison Lohman, who is entirely believable as a 14-year-old) are real enough to cause the viewer to have a vested interest in their ultimate fate, as the movie takes numerous twists & turns.Ridley Scott did quite a good job at crafting a movie that avoids being too obvious, and which flows along nicely, maintaining viewer interest throughout.

I usually don't care who a director is for a movie but I thought it was interesting that this guy was also the director for flicks like Gladiator and Black Hawk Down.  When I heard this I thought, man this should be a good movie.  I has sorta right.  Matchstick Man tells a good storyline but the story doesn't hold my interest all the way through the movie and of course a plot twist at the end sorta ruined it. Nicholas Cage is Roy who is a con-artist that has many personal problems.  He can't stand outdoors and can't stand unorganized and dirty rooms as he makes people take off their shoes before entering his house.  He constantly has trouble keeping with the pills that deal with his personal problems.  One day Roy speaks with a doctor about getting another prescription of pills. His original doctor was on vacation so he saw a substitute.  As he was talking with his personal life he discovers that he has a daughter named Angela with his ex-girlfriend Heather.  Roy is now put in a serious bind as not only is he about to set his biggest score, he is now having to take responsibilities as a father and try to keep her from getting involved in his work.  Of course his daughter isn't what you call a saint.  She smokes like he does, drinks, and has been arrested for shoplifting despite being a minor.  When she find out what he did for a living, she was impressed and does encourage her father to teach her a few things.  She does end up involved in her dad's next con with his partner Frank.  Of course, the con didn't go as planned as the guy they screwed was hot in pursuit of Roy.  The guy even showed up at his house with Frank being helded hostage and in demand with at least half the cut that he owed.  His daughter end up accidentlly killing the guy in attempt to defend her father.  Now all three of their lives are in jeopardy, but Angela is the only one that Roy is really concerned about.  He has frank drive off with her far away and try to hook up on a later day.  However, Roy talks to Heather and discovers that when she was pregnant, she had a miscarriage.  Roy was hurt and felt betrayed but as he promised Angela during the movie, he does give up cons and works at a furniture store where he mets Angela one year later.  Even though he was disappointed with being set up, they do reconcile their differences. Nicholas Cage and the girl who played Angela were the only saving graces of this movie.  They worked well together.  The movie had a great story but it was hard to stay focused throughout the whole movie as they showed too many scenes of him looking for his medication and making trips to the drug store which I thought was a little unnecessary.  It is at least worthy of a rental, then you can draw your own conclusions.",3,It was okay,1078790400,"03 9, 2004",2004,2849,"['watching', 'movie', 'heard', 'guy', 'named', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'directed', 'movie', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'director', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'guy', 'was', 'also', 'director', 'flicks', 'Gladiator', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'When', 'heard', 'thought', 'man', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'sorta', 'right', 'Matchstick', 'Man', 'good', 'storyline', 'story', ""n't"", 'hold', 'interest', 'way', 'movie', 'course', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'sorta', 'ruined', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Roy', 'who', 'con-artist', 'many', 'personal', 'problems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'outdoors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'unorganized', 'dirty', 'rooms', 'people', 'take', 'off', 'shoes', 'entering', 'house', 'constantly', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'pills', 'deal', 'personal', 'problems', 'One', 'day', 'Roy', 'doctor', 'getting', 'prescription', 'pills', 'original', 'doctor', 'was', 'vacation', 'saw', 'substitute', 'was', 'talking', 'personal', 'life', 'daughter', 'named', 'Angela', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Heather', 'Roy', 'now', 'put', 'serious', 'bind', 'not', 'only', 'about', 'set', 'biggest', 'score', 'now', 'having', 'take', 'responsibilities', 'father', 'try', 'keep', 'getting', 'involved', 'work', 'course', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'what', 'call', 'saint', 'drinks', 'been', 'arrested', 'shoplifting', 'being', 'minor', 'When', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'did', 'living', 'was', 'impressed', 'encourage', 'father', 'teach', 'few', 'things', 'end', 'up', 'involved', 'dad', 'next', 'con', 'partner', 'Frank', 'course', 'con', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'guy', 'screwed', 'was', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'Roy', 'guy', 'even', 'showed', 'up', 'house', 'Frank', 'being', 'helded', 'hostage', 'demand', 'least', 'cut', 'owed', 'daughter', 'end', 'up', 'accidentlly', 'killing', 'guy', 'attempt', 'defend', 'father', 'Now', 'three', 'lives', 'are', 'jeopardy', 'Angela', 'only', 'one', 'Roy', 'really', 'concerned', 'frank', 'drive', 'off', 'far', 'away', 'try', 'hook', 'up', 'later', 'day', 'However', 'Roy', 'talks', 'Heather', 'discovers', 'when', 'was', 'pregnant', 'had', 'miscarriage', 'Roy', 'was', 'hurt', 'felt', 'betrayed', 'promised', 'Angela', 'movie', 'give', 'up', 'cons', 'furniture', 'store', 'where', 'Angela', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'Even', 'was', 'disappointed', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'do', 'reconcile', 'differences', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Angela', 'were', 'only', 'saving', 'graces', 'movie', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'story', 'was', 'hard', 'stay', 'focused', 'whole', 'movie', 'showed', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'looking', 'medication', 'making', 'trips', 'drug', 'store', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'unnecessary', 'least', 'worthy', 'rental', 'then', 'can', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions']",N/A

I find him to be an actor that&#8217;s losing his looks and is not dealing with it gracefully and try to cling to roles that, sadly, are not suited for him any more. Roy, neurotic, flim flam man however is a role that suits his well. He is a con artist that specializes in stealing money from medium income families naive enough to get sucked into their schemes with the help of his partner played by Sam Rockwell.Roy is special in this role because while he can successfully pull off a con he is in dire need of his medication, without it, he becomes obsessive compulsive about cleaning, agoraphobic and replete with a whole host of facial ticks and jerks which makes him very unpleasant to deal with.When Roy loses his medication he needs to see a new psychologist who gets him pills, as well as discusses the possibiilty of reconnecting with the money he left when she was 2 months pregnant. Now a 14 year old girl he starts entering his life, while still trying to do these multilayered cons, granted to guys who really deserve being heist. Well the worlds start to mix and before you know it  he&#8217;s bonding with her, teaching her his business, and having difficulty with what&#8217;s right and what&#8217;s wrong.Roy has always been excellent at keeping the cons separate from the normal pace of his life and now all of it is embroiled into a mess.

791679,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00012QLAA,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[10, 10]","`Matchstick Men' is one of those movies that makes you realize why some actors have support.  Up until watching this film I had been a `Cage-Hater', a guy who just couldn't wrap his head around all the critical support (granted, I saw this movie before watching `Adaptation' and since watching that film I've realized this man `can' act, he just chooses not to half the time).  Here though Nicolas Cage gave me a brief glimpse of the man that everyone else sees.  As con-artist Roy Waller, Cage gives us a brilliant performance.My main problem with Cage has been his stiff natured acting, the fact that every time he speaks it feels as if he's reading a prompter card, and so I think that the fact that his character here suffers from a severe case of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) helps a lot in that regard since he's supposed to sound stiff and unnatural.Roy works with fellow con Frank (Sam Rockwell), the young hotshot prot&eacute;g&eacute; who has higher ambitions than Roy himself, and this is causing them to butt-heads a bit.  The real drama though comes in the form of Angela (Alison Lohman), a young 14-year old who claims to be his daughter.  At first Roy's put off and distant, but after Angela shows major interest in her fathers line of `work' they begin to bond by pulling small con-jobs together.  Meanwhile Frank is getting more and more agitated with the new bond between father and daughter because it's causing a strain on a big job they have coming up.Filled with twists and turns and an ending I never saw coming, `Matchstick Men' is the perfect kind of caper.  It's got great acting from a cast I never knew had it in them and a great moral message that manifests itself as the film unravels.

Nicholas Cage plays Roy, a con man who has obsessive-compulsive disorder works with a parter played by Sam Rockwell, also good here.  Cage and Rockwell are the best here, the pros at what they do.  Making cons successful each time, though when Cage loses his pills to an unforunate accident he must see a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist advises him to see the past in his life and find out more about his earlier life.  Surprisingly enough a 14 year-old daugher is involved named Angela played by Alison Lohman.Angela soons learns of her father's profession and wants to learn how to actually perform a con.  From here the film takes on an even more interesting path.  Even though the film as a clever premise, Cage's amazing perfomance dazzles and really keeps you fully focused.  Based on the novel by Eric Garcia, ""matchstick"" is a slang term for con artists.  Diretor Ridley Scott continues to impress with another wonderful film here aside from his other good work including Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Alien, even Hannibal.Matchstick Men is rated PG-13 for Thematic Elements, Violence, Some Sexual Content and Language.

791681,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B00012QLAA,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[1, 1]","Have you ever had a really great prank played on you? No matter how funny the prank actually is, its been played at your expense and so you laugh heartily, but inside you're pretty pissed off?  That's how I felt sitting through Ridley Scott's MATCHSTICK MAN.  A film that's so good, and yet in the end, goes one step too far.The story stars Nicholas Cage (Adaptation) as Roy Waller, a con-artist with what seems like OCD.  He can't help but clean things; he a tad bit crazy that way.  His partner in crime is Frank (Sam Rockwell, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind); he's the brawn of the operation to Roy's brains.  Frank spends most of the movie setting up people, and Roy goes in for the kill.When Roy runs out of his medication, he goes to a shrink to get some more.  Only to face the fact that he wishes he had a relationship with his daughter (Alison Lohman, White Oleander).  Eventually the two meet and they strike up a relationship.  Pretty soon she's in on some of Roy and Frank's con jobs.MATCHSTICK MEN is a brilliantly conceived movie that refuses to remain at all conventional.  Roy and his daughter Angela have this unique and fun relationship.  It's great to watch a man fight his quirks for the people he loves.  I loved that the moment Angela shows up on Roy's doorstep that his immaculate house is dirtied and yet Roy doesn't seem bothered by it.  That's real progress.Nicholas Cage does a fine job as Roy.  He walks the thin line between a real person and a cartoon so well, you sometimes forget you're looking at the guy from SNAKE EYES.  He plays these larger than life characters with so much vigor you forget he's acting.Cage is best in the small scenes in the Supermarket.  There is this beautiful women (Shelia Kelley, Nurse Betty) that Roy really loves.  They have this connection with so few words.  Like they long to spill their life stories out at each other, but they just say hi to each other and that's almost enough.  When Roy finally asks her name it's like a floodgate has open, and he is a man reborn.What bugs me about this film is that I'm not sure about the ending.  It's everything I have ever wanted in a movie and yet it left me cold.  It's hard to explain why because it would ruin the movie.  But I guess it's an important lesson in the fact that ""there is no such thing as a free lunch"", and ""what you sow, must also you reap.""Now that I think of it, this film reminds me so much of the outcome of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  Of course Alex deserved what he got in the end, but don't you feel sorry about it.  Roy is not a good person, he's taken advantage of everyone who he's come into contact with, but can loving one person be enough penance for a lifetime of sins?All in all Ridley Scott sets a nice light tone on what otherwise could have been a more standard gritty and dramatic picture.  His visual style is really close to Noir without the faded fedoras and the stanch seriousness.  It's definitely one of those films that will have a hard time being jammed into just one genre category, and that's okay with me.Why not give MATCHSTICK MEN a look, you may be left scratching your head in the end, but at least it's a compelling ride.**** out of 5",4,"What You Sow, Also You Reap",1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,3191,"['Have', 'ever', 'had', 'really', 'great', 'prank', 'played', 'matter', 'how', 'prank', 'actually', 'been', 'played', 'expense', 'so', 'laugh', 'heartily', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'pissed', 'off', 'how', 'felt', 'sitting', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'MATCHSTICK', 'MAN', 'A', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'yet', 'end', 'one', 'step', 'too', 'far.The', 'story', 'stars', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Adaptation', 'Roy', 'Waller', 'con-artist', 'what', 'OCD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'clean', 'things', 'tad', 'bit', 'crazy', 'way', 'partner', 'crime', 'Frank', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Confessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', 'brawn', 'operation', 'Roy', 'brains', 'Frank', 'most', 'movie', 'setting', 'up', 'people', 'Roy', 'kill.When', 'Roy', 'medication', 'shrink', 'get', 'more', 'Only', 'face', 'fact', 'had', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'White', 'Oleander', 'Eventually', 'two', 'meet', 'strike', 'up', 'relationship', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Roy', 'Frank', 'con', 'jobs.MATCHSTICK', 'MEN', 'brilliantly', 'conceived', 'movie', 'remain', 'conventional', 'Roy', 'daughter', 'Angela', 'have', 'unique', 'fun', 'relationship', 'great', 'watch', 'man', 'fight', 'quirks', 'people', 'loved', 'moment', 'Angela', 'up', 'Roy', 'doorstep', 'immaculate', 'house', 'dirtied', 'yet', 'Roy', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bothered', 'real', 'progress.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'fine', 'job', 'Roy', 'thin', 'line', 'real', 'person', 'cartoon', 'so', 'well', 'sometimes', 'forget', ""'re"", 'looking', 'guy', 'SNAKE', 'EYES', 'larger', 'life', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'vigor', 'forget', 'acting.Cage', 'best', 'small', 'scenes', 'Supermarket', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Shelia', 'Kelley', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'Roy', 'really', 'have', 'connection', 'so', 'few', 'words', 'long', 'spill', 'life', 'stories', 'out', 'other', 'just', 'say', 'hi', 'other', 'almost', 'enough', 'When', 'Roy', 'finally', 'name', 'floodgate', 'open', 'man', 'reborn.What', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ending', 'everything', 'have', 'ever', 'wanted', 'movie', 'yet', 'left', 'cold', 'hard', 'explain', 'why', 'would', 'ruin', 'movie', 'guess', 'important', 'lesson', 'fact', 'such', 'thing', 'free', 'lunch', 'what', 'sow', 'must', 'also', 'reap', 'Now', 'think', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'outcome', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'course', 'Alex', 'deserved', 'what', 'got', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'Roy', 'not', 'good', 'person', 'taken', 'advantage', 'everyone', 'who', 'come', 'contact', 'can', 'loving', 'one', 'person', 'be', 'enough', 'penance', 'lifetime', 'sins', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'nice', 'light', 'tone', 'what', 'otherwise', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'standard', 'gritty', 'dramatic', 'picture', 'visual', 'style', 'really', 'close', 'Noir', 'faded', 'fedoras', 'stanch', 'seriousness', 'definitely', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'being', 'jammed', 'just', 'one', 'genre', 'category', 'okay', 'me.Why', 'not', 'give', 'MATCHSTICK', 'MEN', 'look', 'may', 'be', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'end', 'least', 'compelling', 'ride', '****', '5']",N/A

Then Roy's long lost daughter is introduced into his life and Roy starts to re-evaluate the choices he has made in light of him now being a responsible father.

791684,A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ,B00012QLAA,David M. Lovin,"[0, 0]","Nicolas Cage has been one of my favorite actors for a long time now.  He has had some stinkers recently (8MM, Bringing out the Dead) but he returns with a performance so masterful, it almost makes the earlier bombs not seem as bad.  He is forced into multiple roles in this movie and he pulls them off masterfully.Cage plays Roy Waller, a con man (or Matchstick man) who works with partner Sam Rockwell to bilk people out of money to install water filter systems.  Once they have that cash, they go to the house of the suckers posing as Federal agents and gain access to their accounts to get all they own.  It's brilliant and the two work it perfectly.There are a couple of hitches.  One is that Roy has OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)  He has to open and close doors three times (while counting aloud) before going through them, he abhors shoes or any dirt on his carpet at home, and when he loses his medication down the drain, he goes through his entire house cleaning every square inch.  Cage plays the part perfectly; he is totally believable as a man with this condition and that speaks highly of his performance.The other hitch is 14 year old Allison Lohman playing Cage's daughter from a previous marriage.  She shows up in a park to meet him and soon they are the best of friends.  She finds out eventually what he does for a living (he told her at first that he is an antique dealer) and even learns a few tricks of the trade from him.  She is a real breath of fresh air in the film and she will be making movies for years to come.This film has been compared to ""The Sting"" many times, presumably for the ending, which does contain some surprises.  It is similar to the 1974 classic.  This time the Robert Shaw role is played by Bruce McGill.  But as you will see, this film even takes the con further, to areas that were a complete surprise to me.  It is effective, smart, funny at times, and with the performance Nicolas Cage turns in, it's a complete winner.

791685,AYOPN5ABOAUER,B00012QLAA,DavidRoss,"[12, 16]","Nicolas Cage plays Roy, a master con-artist handicapped by a constellation of psychological problems, including agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Professional success has given him a nice home and car and plenty of money, but he's friendless, has no family, and cannot seem to connect with anyone except his protege, Frank (Sam Rockwell), who wants Roy to put together an ambitious swindle so they can make a big score together.  Roy's life is further complicated by a psychiatrist (Bruce Altman) who forces him to confront his own guilt, and by his efforts to build a belated relationship with the abandoned daughter he never knew (Alison Lohman).Enter a wealthy, unscrupulous mark (Bruce McGill) whom Frank & Roy set up for the big score, and all the pieces are in place for this unique grifter tale adapted by Nicholas & Ted Griffin from Eric Garcia's book.  The story has nearly as many twists and turns as Mamet's HOUSE OF GAMES and THE SPANISH PRISONER, but there is much more to it than an ingeniously entertaining plot.  At times it seems like a dark comedy that tickles the intellect more than the funny bone, yet it never fails to respect each of its characters and to regard Roy's predicament seriously.  The unfolding story reveals surprising emotional and spiritual depth as Roy reluctantly confronts his karma and begins a quest for redemption.  By suffering the consequences of his choices--and accepting responsibility for them--Roy discovers the power of forgiveness to radically transform his life.Nicolas Cage is at his best as Roy.  He pulls off an impressive balancing act by creating a believable, sympathetic, and fully-human character from material more prone to derivative mediocrity.  The supporting cast is equally good, with not one sour note among the players.  Rockwell gives his best performance since GALAXY QUEST.  Newcomer Lohman shows star potential in her convincing portrayal of a girl scarcely half her own age.  Altman is perfect as the psychiatrist, and Bruce McGill again demonstrates why he is the heir-apparent to the late J.T. Walsh as the consummate character actor.Director Ridley Scott, of course, is one of the few contemporary masters of cinema.  The auteur behind such landmark films as THE DUELLISTS, ALIEN, and BLADE RUNNER, in recent years he has de-emphasized the breathtaking imagery that established his reputation and now employs his impeccable filmcraft in making more apparently conventional Hollywood-type movies--i.e. THELMA AND LOUISE, GLADIATOR, and BLACK HAWK DOWN.  With MATCHSTICK MEN, he reinterprets the con-artist flick, a perennially popular sub-genre (THE STING, PAPER MOON).  True to form, it is masterfully crafted.  Cinematographer John Mathieson (GLADIATOR) and editor Dody Dorn (MEMENTO) share the credit, for every shot is impeccably framed and the brilliant editing calls so little attention to itself that even Oscar overlooked it.In short, this is an unpretentious and deceptively unambitious movie that succeeds on every artistic level.  The MPAA may not have deemed it Oscar worthy, but posterity may judge it more favorably than any of this year's Best Picture nominees.  If you appreciate tight plotting, good acting, subtle wit, splendid craftsmanship, memorable characters, and a story that rings emotionally true, you will probably like this movie as much as I did.

With classics such as About Schmidt, 25th Hour, Adaptation, Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and Punch Drunk Love, I was finally given the best film of the year so far. Matchstick Men.Matchstick Men stars Nicolas Cage as Roy Waller. Ridden with ticks and obsessive complusion disorder, Roy keeps his house extremly organized. Roy is a con man(con artist!) and he and his partner Frank have been doing small jobs. But Frank wants to bring Roy into a big job. To dupe a man Chuck Frechette into a currency enchange con. But Roy drops his medicine down the drain and the shortage of his ILLIGAL med's causes him to go over the edge with his problem. Frank suggests that he see a shrink and he meets Dr. Klein and we find out that Roy ws married and that he might have a 14 year old daughter. Klein calls his ex wife to find out because Roy has problems talking to her. And Roy meets his 14 year old daughter Angela.Angela like his tics and his disorder. But when he tells her what he really does for a living(he says he's an antique's broker) and she forces him to teach her the tricks of the trade. But the help in the latest con goes wrong, with surprising results.Matchstick Men was excellant. I loved everything and everyone about it. It had a plot with three story lines so if one plotline goes out there are always fallbacks. But non of the storylines ever leaves you uninterested. The first storyline is Roy's problem with his illness. The second one is Frank and Roy's con. The third is the more personal storyline about Roy and his relationship with his new found daughter. The movie drifts from comedy, to suspense, to heart. With an ending that is so unexpected you would never see it coming. There are no hints of it in the advertising for you to even guess that it is coming.Go see Matchstick Men. No question. It is no doubt the best film of the year 2003 so far and along with the lists of the best films of all time. Great acting by Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell, and Loyman playing his daughter, with a great score by composer Hans Zimmer. Matchstick Men is the kind of movie that I've been waiting for and it finally came.

With the Fascist convergence of business and government we see the emergence of a long con in the ""reform"" of Social Security.Of course, the message is ambiguous. It could very well be that it's good to feel emotions which later turn out not to have content (see above warning concerning spoilers). The lottery ticket holder gets a buzz, doesn't he, from quantum possibility.For the same reason, the populace as a whole gets a buzz, don't they, from allowing WMD and Social Security pigeon drops to occur.The content of a quick smoke by the loading dock is actually damage, so the buzz is at variance with the content. Emotions, like Cage's in the movie, are dulled because the buzz is activated too often in a false alarm.But this is also to insist that it's hopeless to dream of a real daughter personally, or a meaningful election politically. Buzz becomes an ersatz for reality.Which is to speculate that objectively, any Hollywood apparatus will increasingly virtualize emotion and cynically deprive it of content so that the disempowered audience will itself be conned into norming its responses to an unbearable reality.The norming will continue on ever more extensive lines of credit until human voices wake us, and we drown.",4,"Record of damaged life (caution, possible spoilers)",1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,1871,"['Cage', 'common', 'character', 'latter', 'day', 'America', 'man', 'addicted', 'drug', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'who', 'was', 'last', 'relationship', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'who', 'developed', 'variety', 'tics', 'cons', 'get', 'by.In', 'movie', 'Cage', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'long', 'con', 'con', 'man', 'taken', 'ride.The', 'intellectual', 'pleasures', 'movie', 'are', 'high', 'not', 'only', 'figuring', 'out', 'con', 'also', 'sessions', 'required', 'talk', 'shrink', 'office.But', 'America', 'not', 'spend', 'time', 'couch', 'comforting', 'multi-level', 'marketed', 'scam', 'brutal', 'truth', 'personally', 'politically', 'Fascist', 'convergence', 'business', 'government', 'see', 'emergence', 'long', 'con', 'reform', 'Social', 'Security.Of', 'course', 'message', 'ambiguous', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'good', 'feel', 'emotions', 'later', 'turn', 'out', 'not', 'have', 'content', 'see', 'warning', 'concerning', 'spoilers', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'holder', 'buzz', ""n't"", 'quantum', 'possibility.For', 'same', 'reason', 'populace', 'whole', 'buzz', 'do', ""n't"", 'allowing', 'WMD', 'Social', 'Security', 'pigeon', 'drops', 'occur.The', 'content', 'quick', 'smoke', 'loading', 'dock', 'actually', 'damage', 'buzz', 'variance', 'content', 'Emotions', 'Cage', 'movie', 'are', 'dulled', 'buzz', 'activated', 'too', 'often', 'false', 'alarm.But', 'also', 'insist', 'hopeless', 'dream', 'real', 'daughter', 'personally', 'meaningful', 'election', 'politically', 'Buzz', 'ersatz', 'reality.Which', 'speculate', 'objectively', 'Hollywood', 'apparatus', 'will', 'increasingly', 'virtualize', 'emotion', 'cynically', 'deprive', 'content', 'disempowered', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'conned', 'norming', 'responses', 'unbearable', 'reality.The', 'norming', 'will', 'continue', 'ever', 'more', 'extensive', 'lines', 'credit', 'human', 'voices', 'wake', 'drown']",N/A

It could've been great; with Ridley Scott (!!!) directing and Nicolas Cage, Same Rockwell, and Alison Lohman starring in a film about the always-entertaining topic of crime, ""What could possibly go wrong?"" I thought.  A lot.Ridley Scott is an amazing director, yes; he directed my favorite movie of all time, ""Gladiator"".  However, when it comes to movies about humans plus a relatively wordy script, minus high-voltage special effects and sets, Scott seems absolutely at a loss.  His clumsy, impersonal direction never lets us truly identify with the characters or their plight.  And maybe that's not such a bad thing since these flimsy, paper-thin characters adapted from Eric Garcia's novel by Nicholas and Ted Griffin are hardly worth getting to know.It is through no fault of the actors, though.  Cage, who is, for me, the sole reason to watch this movie, is delightful, funny, and charming as an obsessive-compulsive con man whose relentless housecleaning is put to a rest only by his reunion with his long-lost teenage daughter (Lohman).  I really enjoyed watching Cage throw himself into this role and truly become his character.

The frenetic and ultra-talented Sam Rockwell as Roy's partner/sidekick con-man Frank is certainly one to watch; his character here is ambitious, and one fault of the film (or perhaps just the short-sighted nature of its ""hero"" Roy) is that Roy places too much trust in Frank. Being con-men, who lie, cheat and steal for a living, I find it hard to believe that Roy would treat Frank as openly as he does, and see him as so innocuous.

In MATCHSTICK MEN he has taken a small-scale story and created a wholly believable tale of intrigue, surprises, tenderness, and unconventional outcomes.&#65533;Matchstick men&#65533; is another term for grifters or con artists and Nicholas Cage and Sam Rockwell are small scale but superb practitioners of the trade. Cage plays Roy, a neurotic, twitchy, obsessive compulsive agoraphobic  mess of a man who despite is fear of the &#65533;outdoors&#65533; is the main brain behind enormously clever scams.  His partner Frank as played by Sam Rockwell is as casual as Roy is uptight and the two play the opposite ends of the spectrum of normalcy&#65533;s bell curve to the hilt.  As the film opens the two are in action, demonstrating their skills in small time trade. But enter Chuck (Bruce McGill) as a target for big time money and the speed accelerates. Roy, who controls his neuroses by medication, accidentally loses his pills down the garbage disposal, freaks, and ultimately in desperation finds a psychiatrist (the very smooth Bruce Altman) with the intent of gaining a prescription for more meds.Enter Angela (Alison Lohman, the 14-year-old daughter Roy abandoned when he left his pregnant wife 14 years ago, and the story alters.  Though initially terrified of the prospect of being with his &#65533;daughter&#65533;, he gradually warms to her, especially when he discovers that Angela is keen on learning her father&#65533;s trade.  Roy  and Frank reluctantly include Angela in a major scam against Chuck and the remainder of the film is a tense roll of how everything than can go wrong, indeed does.

Cage gives a master class in acting with his portrayal of Roy, a small-time L.A. con man with no life outside his 'work', and some Issues with a capital 'I'.  Roy suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, which manifests itself in a fetish for cleanliness and various repetitive actions and physical twitches and tics.  Roy feels safest indoors, and when he's at home, gives free reign to all his idiosyncratic behaviors.  On the job, he's managed to master his condition well enough to build a very successful 'business', complete with his own junior partner (Sam Rockwell).  Roy's micro-managed life is thrown a curveball in the form of a 14-year-old girl named Angela (a dazzling turn by Alison Lohman of 'White Oleander', convincing as a young teen even though she was 22 at the time) . . .the daughter Roy has never met, since he split with her mom before Angela was born.  The burgeoning relationship between Roy and Angela forces Roy to confront the the moral dilemmas posed by his profession that are the true cause of his illness.  There's a lot of entertaining caper business along the way, but this father-daughter relationship is the heart of the film.  Cage embodies Roy with a decency and humanity that makes him likeable despite the bad things he does for a living.  In lesser hands, Roy's mannerisms might have overshadowed the character and pushed him into parody, but Cage applies them with restraint & consistency so that we get the feeling that inside and out, he IS Roy, as a man with this condition might actually exist.  When he pulls out all the stops to show Roy in the throes of a major meltdown, it's humorous, and yet shows the pathos of OCD in a way that wouldn't be possible if he were over the top all the time.Shot on location around Los Angeles, the movie has a breezy, upbeat feel that is purposely at odds with the darker events happening to Roy at the center.  The irony of a character who is afraid to go outside, staying inside behind closed blinds, when outside L.A. is glaringly bright and spacious highlights the loneliness of Roy's inner world.  The retro soundtrack, infused with Sinatra and other Rat-Pack classics is also 'instrumental' in creating a sunny mood at odds with Roy's darker reality.  It's not really correct to classify this movie as a comedy; though there are humorous moments throughout, this is a complex, multilayered film that transcends mere comedy.  In this way, it is similar in tone and style to Stephen Spielberg's 'Catch Me if You Can'.  Almost as enjoyable as the film is the feature making-of documentary that follows director Ridley Scott & his stellar cast and crew through the year-long process of bringing 'Matchstick Men' to the screen.

We have a very personal, up-close light drama here. Con artist movies have been swarming the theatres lately, but Matchstick Men is far more intelligent and more surprising, not to mention well-acted, written and directed, than Supercast films Heist and The Score. Nicolas Cage, after several years of B-action movies (Gone In 60 Seconds, 8 mm, The Rock, Face/Off...) makes a welcome return to what he does best - disturbed, neurotic, sensitive individuals (a comeback that got off to a good start on the schizophrenic Adaptation) - and delivers an Oscar nomination-worthy performance as con artist Roy Waller. Roy discovers a long-lost daughter, played brilliantly by Alison Lohman - also Oscar material. The relationship between the two is well crafted, and the story wonderfully written. Sam Rockwell also makes a fine contribution as Roy's partner.Elements of the plot may owe much to many other films - The Sting, perhaps Jacky Brown, and there's a bit of Leon (AKA The Professional) in Roy's relationship with his daughter, trying to balance a life of crime with a newfound family, and Lohman's performance is no less charming than that of Natalie Portman on that memorable classic. Worthy of praise is Ridley's directing, which proves he can make a small human theatre piece as well as grandiose historical epics and sci-fi odysseys. The editing is wonderful, well visualizing Roy's condition and giving the movie an apt atmosphere. Overall, Matchstick Men is one of the freshest films of the year, and a very enjoyable watch.",4,"Welcome back, Nick",1065225600,"10 4, 2003",2003,1790,"['rather', 'surprising', 'turn', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'probably', 'smallest', 'film', 'ever', 'done', 'back', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'anything', 'else', 'done', 'recent', 'years', 'Gladiator', 'G.I', 'Jane', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'back', 'Alien', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'have', 'very', 'personal', 'up-close', 'light', 'drama', 'here', 'Con', 'artist', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'swarming', 'theatres', 'lately', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'far', 'more', 'intelligent', 'more', 'surprising', 'not', 'mention', 'well-acted', 'written', 'directed', 'Supercast', 'films', 'Heist', 'Score', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'several', 'years', 'B-action', 'movies', 'Gone', '60', 'Seconds', '8', 'mm', 'Rock', 'Face/Off', 'welcome', 'return', 'what', 'best', 'disturbed', 'neurotic', 'sensitive', 'individuals', 'comeback', 'got', 'off', 'good', 'start', 'schizophrenic', 'Adaptation', 'delivers', 'Oscar', 'nomination-worthy', 'performance', 'con', 'artist', 'Roy', 'Waller', 'Roy', 'long-lost', 'daughter', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'also', 'Oscar', 'material', 'relationship', 'two', 'well', 'crafted', 'story', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'also', 'fine', 'contribution', 'Roy', 'partner.Elements', 'plot', 'may', 'owe', 'much', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Sting', 'perhaps', 'Jacky', 'Brown', 'bit', 'Leon', 'AKA', 'Professional', 'Roy', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'trying', 'balance', 'life', 'crime', 'newfound', 'family', 'Lohman', 'performance', 'less', 'charming', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'memorable', 'classic', 'Worthy', 'praise', 'Ridley', 'directing', 'can', 'make', 'small', 'human', 'theatre', 'piece', 'as', 'well', 'grandiose', 'historical', 'epics', 'sci-fi', 'odysseys', 'editing', 'wonderful', 'well', 'visualizing', 'Roy', 'condition', 'giving', 'movie', 'apt', 'atmosphere', 'Overall', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'one', 'freshest', 'films', 'year', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch']",N/A
791705,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00012QLAA,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[1, 4]","Ridley Scott's ""Matchstick Men"" is an extremely clever film with unexpected twists and a wonderful performance by Nicholas Cage which compensates for some of the holes in the plot.Roy Waller, our hero, played by Cage, is riddled with neuroses. He is a recovering alcoholic, agoraphobic chainsmoker, somewhat disabled by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and panic attacks, which cause repetitive behavior and a multitude of ticks, especially when he fails to take his medication. He is also a successful grifter, a gifted and innovative con man. ""Matchstick Man"" is slang for con artist. His partner and protege, Frank Mercer, (Sam Rockwell), cares for Roy almost like a brother. The two share a close friendship and a long association. Frank wants his mentor to pull himself together so they can conduct a major scam and make some big bucks. Frank persuades Roy to see a psychiatrist, (Bruce Altman), who wants him to confront his past and encourages him to get to know the daughter he has never met. Enter adorable adolescent daughter Angela, (Alison Lohman), who lives with Roy's ex-wife and charms her newly found dad to open himself up to the first meaningful emotional attachment he may have ever had. She begins to upset his obsessively controlled, organized world. Angela, awed by her father's chosen profession, surprisingly persuades him to give her a shot at being a con-child. She's quite good at it too - a regular chip off the old block.While father-daughter relationship is developing, Frank is putting together the scam of a lifetime with an easy, very wealthy mark. Roy, with newly found parental scruples, has qualms about pulling it off. This is where the action really begins and the plot twists and turns, so I won't continue as I don't want to spoil the film for potential viewers.Except for some terrific acting, this is not a major film but it is good entertainment. Filled with dark humor, the movie is funny at times, sometimes moving, with a few real surprises. The plot has its predictable moments and Angela's character gets tiresome as she continually gets her way through repetitive childish tantrums, whining and pouting. The Frank Sinatra soundtrack wonderfully sets a 1950s milieu. There's an awful epilogue that Director Scott should have excluded. I do recommend seeing this because there are many more good moments than bad ones - and watching Nicholas Cage is well worth the price of admission or rental.

791708,A1PNNR3B9H8GTC,B00012QLAA,Jeremy Berman,"[0, 0]","Matchstick Men serves as a virtual manual in the complex art of screen acting. Nicholas Cage scores one of the greatest triumphs of his turbulent career as an obsessive-compulsive con-artist who fears fresh air, ticks, and dirt and devours an endless series of pills to keep from obsessing over the unkempt appearance of his carpet. Faced with the challenge of portraying an individual who is characterized by his emotional instability and diversity, Cage effortlessly changes the tone and texture of his performance from scene to scene and conveys a greater range of emotions than most actors tackle in half a dozen movies. He is unabashedly charismatic and debonair as he convinces elderly ladies that the key to achieving a fabulous prize is to transfer money into his bank account, frighteningly compelling as he desperately begs a psychiatrist for stabilizing medication and remarkably poignant as he reflects on his inability to form meaningful connections with other people. Cage's work is complemented brilliantly by the supporting performances of Sam Rockwell and Allison Lohman, which each express a sardonic perceptiveness and youthful zest for life that plays remarkably well against the leading actor's edgy paranoia.As it turns out, the movie that contains these Oscar worthy characterizations isn't half bad either. The engaging script by Ted and Nicholas Griffin tells the story of Roy Waller (Cage), a ""matchstick man"" whose life is turned upside down when he learns that he is the father of a spirited adolescent girl named Angela (Lohman). Roy's humorous efforts to become a doting and morally responsible parent complicate his profitable partnership with wisecracking con-man Frank Mercer (Rockwell) and ultimately threaten his efforts to swindle a conniving business executive (Bruce McGill) out of several million dollars. The film abounds with dozens of scenes that radiate warmth and charm, including a delightful sequence where Roy teaches Angela the craft of con artistry by helping her convince an overworked housewife that she has won the lottery, a humorously touching episode when Angela attempts to teach her insecure father how to bowl and an indescribably hilarious moment when Frank tries to get under his neurotic partner's skin by coming on to him in an airport (this is worth the price of admission alone). Director Ridley Scott also enlivens the proceedings by featuring an appropriately glossy soundtrack of old Sinatra tunes and reflecting the mood of the characters in the nature of cinematography (Ray's ultra neat home has a sterile, blue texture and the outdoor locations are all uncomfortably bright to stress Ray's discomfort in the open air).Regrettably, Scott has chosen to saddle this charming film with a clever but heartless ""twist"" ending that undermines much of the character growth that the audience has just witnessed.

791714,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00012QLAA,Joe Sherry,"[2, 3]","A film by Ridley ScottWith the track record of Ridley Scott in mind (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Thelma and Louise, Black Hawk Down), any time the man makes a new movie I am automatically interested in it.  He has a history of creativity and excellence in filmmaking and any new movie that he directs is worth giving a chance.  It was with high expectations that I went into ""Matchstick Men"", a story of a con-artist.Roy (Nicolas Cage) and Frank (Sam Rockwell) are partners in the art of conning people out of their money.  As Roy explains in the film, he doesn't steal people's money, they give it to him.  They are mainly working small phone scams for smaller payouts (though Roy seems to be well off considering the size of his house), but Frank is looking to get a big score, which Roy agrees to work.  Simple enough, but Roy also has some serious issues.  He is compulsive (he must turn the locks or open and close doors three times before actually opening the door all the way), somewhat manic, and he has trouble dealing with the outdoors.  Neatness/cleanliness is another issue.  Roy is a man with tics.Into this imperfect, but somewhat structured life comes a big change: Roy's daughter Angela (Alison Lohman).  When Roy accidentally knocks his supply of medication down the drain, Roy has to start searching for a psychologist who will prescribe some more on short notice.  The doctor he does find also suggests that Roy gets in contact with his daughter, whom he has never met.  Angela is a breath of fresh air into Roy's otherwise empty life, but it is also causing some conflict into the big con that Roy and Frank are working on.My expectations may have been too high, because I wasn't overly impressed with ""Matchstick Men"".  For the first half to two thirds of the movie, I just could not engage with the characters.  Part of the problem probably lies in the fact that I do not care for Nicolas Cage as an actor.  It just seems like he is trying too hard to create a character through personality tics (with the notable exceptions of Leaving Las Vegas, and The Family Man).  His characters are just not likeable, or interesting enough for me to engage with, but I understand that this is just a personal perception.The shining star of the movie is Alison Lohman (also in White Oleander) who was nearly 10 years older than the age she was playing in the movie.  She can act and look so young and vulnerable despite being in her mid 20's.  The rest of the acting was well done (though I still don't care for Cage), but it didn't all come together like I would have expected.  The idea of the ""con"" runs throughout the entire movie and there are several twists along the way, but this is a fairly lightweight movie up until about three quarters of the way through the movie when it completely changes in tone (and oddly enough becomes a better movie).  I hoped for so much more from ""Matchstick Men"", but I didn't think it lived up to the promise of what it could have been with the talent involved.-Joe Sherry",3,Did not live up to my expectations,1089072000,"07 6, 2004",2004,3027,"['film', 'Ridley', 'ScottWith', 'track', 'record', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'mind', 'Alien', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Gladiator', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'time', 'man', 'new', 'movie', 'am', 'automatically', 'interested', 'history', 'creativity', 'excellence', 'filmmaking', 'new', 'movie', 'worth', 'giving', 'chance', 'was', 'high', 'expectations', 'went', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'story', 'con-artist.Roy', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Frank', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'are', 'partners', 'art', 'conning', 'people', 'money', 'Roy', 'film', ""n't"", 'steal', 'people', 'money', 'give', 'are', 'mainly', 'working', 'small', 'phone', 'scams', 'smaller', 'payouts', 'Roy', 'be', 'well', 'considering', 'size', 'house', 'Frank', 'looking', 'get', 'big', 'score', 'Roy', 'work', 'Simple', 'enough', 'Roy', 'also', 'serious', 'issues', 'compulsive', 'must', 'turn', 'locks', 'open', 'close', 'doors', 'three', 'times', 'actually', 'opening', 'door', 'way', 'somewhat', 'manic', 'trouble', 'dealing', 'outdoors', 'Neatness/cleanliness', 'issue', 'Roy', 'man', 'tics.Into', 'imperfect', 'somewhat', 'structured', 'life', 'big', 'change', 'Roy', 'daughter', 'Angela', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'When', 'Roy', 'accidentally', 'supply', 'medication', 'drain', 'Roy', 'start', 'searching', 'psychologist', 'who', 'will', 'prescribe', 'more', 'short', 'notice', 'doctor', 'find', 'also', 'Roy', 'contact', 'daughter', 'whom', 'never', 'met', 'Angela', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Roy', 'otherwise', 'empty', 'life', 'also', 'causing', 'conflict', 'big', 'con', 'Roy', 'Frank', 'are', 'working', 'expectations', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'high', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'impressed', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'first', 'half', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'engage', 'characters', 'Part', 'problem', 'probably', 'fact', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'actor', 'just', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'create', 'character', 'personality', 'tics', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Family', 'Man', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'likeable', 'interesting', 'enough', 'engage', 'understand', 'just', 'personal', 'perception.The', 'shining', 'star', 'movie', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'also', 'White', 'Oleander', 'who', 'was', 'nearly', '10', 'years', 'older', 'age', 'was', 'playing', 'movie', 'can', 'act', 'look', 'so', 'young', 'vulnerable', 'being', 'mid', '20', 'rest', 'acting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Cage', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'idea', 'con', 'entire', 'movie', 'are', 'several', 'twists', 'way', 'fairly', 'lightweight', 'movie', 'up', 'three', 'quarters', 'way', 'movie', 'when', 'completely', 'tone', 'oddly', 'enough', 'better', 'movie', 'hoped', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'lived', 'up', 'promise', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'talent', 'involved.-Joe', 'Sherry']",N/A
791715,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00012QLAA,Joseph Haschka,"[4, 5]","For Nicolas Cage fans, MATCHSTICK MEN is a treat diluted only by the knowledge that Cage wasn't even nominated for an Oscar-worthy performance.Cage is Roy, teamed with partner Frank (Sam Rockwell); both are con artists, or &quot;Matchstick Men&quot;. As the film opens, we watch as the two cash in on a scam that enables them to plunder the bank account of an elderly couple.Roy is also an obsessive-compulsive with phobias for dirt and the outdoors. Without his medication, Roy gets twitchy. One day, he accidentally knocks his pill supply down the kitchen sink. Bad timing, since his psychiatrist drug supplier is out of town. On Frank's advice, Roy visits a new shrink, Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman), to whom he admits a previous marriage abandoned some fourteen years previous when his wife was pregnant. Through Klein's intercession, Roy is put in touch with his teenage daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman), who's always been curious about Old Dad. Indeed, against her Mom's wishes, she appears on Roy's doorstep to spend a long weekend. Roy is alternatively smitten with paternal affection and acute anxiety over the dirt Angela tracks onto his carpet. Klein believes the girl's presence is good therapy.MATCHSTICK MEN is about scammers and cons, so, by the time the credits roll, you shouldn't be too surprised at the general storyline, which is one oft seen before. What elevates the film is the intensity of Cage's extraordinary performance as the mentally tortured lead. We've watched Nicolas do this previously in LEAVING LAS VEGAS and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD. Cage is apparently not one for whom a role is simply a facade easily sluiced away at the end of the day's shoot. Cage always makes me believe the screen character is himself through to the core, something which either makes the actor one of the most talented in the Biz or a schizo seriously in need of professional help.The other remarkable performance in this film is that of Lohman. Playing the 14-year old Angela, one is apt to forget, or not believe, that the actress is actually in her mid-twenties. She had me fooled.MATCHSTICK MEN is perhaps one you'll want to see a second time to locate the key sequence where you yourself were fooled.

Scott displays his talent for creating real characters in his films, which he refined in Thelma and Louise (1991). In Matchstick Men Scott pushes himself even further into the human psyche as the main character, Roy Waller (Nicholas Cage), is dealing with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).The con-artist Roy Waller suffers from OCD as he goes about his daily business swindling innocent people with his partner Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell). Accidentally Roy drops his medication in the sink and goes into a cleaning frenzy as his OCD begins to run amok. Frank begins to worry about Roy and connects him with a psychiatrist. Through therapy Roy improves and soon he finds out that he has a daughter from a previous marriage. Roy is forced to deal with his OCD as he is about to confront his 14-year-old daughter he has never seen, and simultaneously pulls off the biggest con of his life before early retirement.The story of Matchstick Men has been told before, but here is retold with a new twist. The new twist circulates around the psychological disorder that Nicholas Cage presents through wonderful acting. In addition, the cinematography projects a visual abstraction of the psychological disorder of Nicholas Cage's character, which enhances the visual experience. Scott also displays clues and hints of what is to come through detailed mise-en-scene. In the end, Matchstick Men offers a good, but not unique cinematic experience.",3,Obsessive Compulsive Nicholas Cage in Terrific Con-Drama,1088035200,"06 24, 2004",2004,1562,"['Ridley', 'Scott', 'directed', 'several', 'block', 'buster', 'films', 'such', 'Alien', '1979', 'Blade', 'Runner', '1982', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', '2002', 'Scott', 'talent', 'creating', 'real', 'characters', 'films', 'refined', 'Thelma', 'Louise', '1991', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'Scott', 'even', 'further', 'human', 'psyche', 'main', 'character', 'Roy', 'Waller', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'dealing', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'disorder', 'OCD', '.The', 'con-artist', 'Roy', 'Waller', 'suffers', 'OCD', 'daily', 'business', 'swindling', 'innocent', 'people', 'partner', 'Frank', 'Mercer', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Accidentally', 'Roy', 'medication', 'sink', 'cleaning', 'frenzy', 'OCD', 'run', 'amok', 'Frank', 'worry', 'Roy', 'psychiatrist', 'therapy', 'Roy', 'improves', 'soon', 'out', 'daughter', 'previous', 'marriage', 'Roy', 'forced', 'deal', 'OCD', 'confront', '14-year-old', 'daughter', 'never', 'seen', 'simultaneously', 'pulls', 'biggest', 'con', 'life', 'early', 'retirement.The', 'story', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'been', 'told', 'here', 'retold', 'new', 'twist', 'new', 'twist', 'circulates', 'psychological', 'disorder', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'presents', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'addition', 'cinematography', 'projects', 'visual', 'abstraction', 'psychological', 'disorder', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'character', 'visual', 'experience', 'Scott', 'also', 'clues', 'hints', 'what', 'come', 'detailed', 'mise-en-scene', 'end', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'good', 'not', 'unique', 'cinematic', 'experience']",N/A

Performance wise, Nicholas Cage, Sam Rockwell and newcomer Alison Lohman all deserve high praise for their individual and collective efforts in this film.Director Ridley Scott, best known for many great films such as &quot;Alien,&quot; &quot;Gladiator&quot; and a whole horde of other outstanding films steps in to direct this film and once again his talents as a skillful director shine as he takes us through the somewhat convoluted script, never revealing too much until the right time.  He deserves a great amount of credit for the success of this film.The Premise:Roy Waller (Nicholas Cage) is an extremely successful con man who has the home and the money to prove it however, he's also an extremely neurotic individual that had an unsuccessful relationship over fifteen years ago and hasn't attempted one since.  He suddenly finds that he needs to get some new anti depressants but now he has to go to a new doctor to get them and this psychologists actually wants him to talk about his problems which leads to him having a &quot;daughter.&quot;  In comes Angela (Alison Lohman), his &quot;daughter&quot; and now he's a parent.What follows from there is a fairly entertaining film as we're treated to Nicholas Cage at his finest in portraying a lonely, neurotic man who suddenly has a daughter and still has his life as a con man to contend with...I would definitely recommend this film to any and all who enjoy a good con/comedy that will have you guessing the direction of the film all the way to its conclusion.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Tricks of the Trade:  Making Matchstick Men-Follow the Director through and intimate day-to-day account of the filmmaking process*Part I:  Preproduction*Part II:  Production*Part III:  Postproduction-Commentary by Director/Producer Ridley Scott, Writer Nicholas Griffin and Writer/Producer Ted Griffin-Theatrical Trailer",4,Matchstick Men - A fairly entertaining film!,1080432000,"03 28, 2004",2004,2318,"['found', 'movie', 'be', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'one', 'watch', 'plot', 'movie', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'one', 'involving', 'few', 'twists', 'here', 'there', 'culminating', 'ultimate', 'con', 'was', 'not', 'predictable', 'only', 'regret', 'not', 'having', 'caught', 'one', 'theaters.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'versatility', 'actor', 'forth', 'extremely', 'neurotic', 'character', 'film', 'Performance', 'wise', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'newcomer', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'deserve', 'high', 'praise', 'individual', 'collective', 'efforts', 'film.Director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'best', 'known', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Alien', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gladiator', 'quot', 'whole', 'horde', 'other', 'outstanding', 'films', 'steps', 'direct', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'talents', 'skillful', 'director', 'shine', 'somewhat', 'convoluted', 'script', 'never', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'right', 'time', 'great', 'amount', 'credit', 'success', 'film.The', 'Premise', 'Roy', 'Waller', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'extremely', 'successful', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'home', 'money', 'prove', 'however', 'also', 'extremely', 'neurotic', 'individual', 'had', 'unsuccessful', 'relationship', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', ""n't"", 'attempted', 'one', 'suddenly', 'get', 'new', 'anti', 'depressants', 'now', 'go', 'new', 'doctor', 'get', 'actually', 'talk', 'problems', 'having', 'quot', 'quot', 'Angela', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'quot', 'daughter', 'quot', 'now', 'parent.What', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'film', ""'re"", 'treated', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'finest', 'portraying', 'lonely', 'neurotic', 'man', 'who', 'suddenly', 'daughter', 'still', 'life', 'con', 'man', 'contend', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'con/comedy', 'will', 'have', 'guessing', 'direction', 'film', 'way', 'conclusion', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Tricks', 'Trade', 'Making', 'Matchstick', 'Men-Follow', 'Director', 'intimate', 'day-to-day', 'account', 'filmmaking', 'process*Part', 'Preproduction*Part', 'II', 'Production*Part', 'III', 'Postproduction-Commentary', 'Director/Producer', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Writer', 'Nicholas', 'Griffin', 'Writer/Producer', 'Ted', 'Griffin-Theatrical', 'Trailer']",N/A

This movie shows what it means to make a movie into a work of art. Every element of this movie is great: plot, characters, motivations, script, dialogue, music, sound, editing....and on and on.The sound track is very detailed. I haven't noticed that before in many movies. Additional sounds like the chime of the seat belt warning, the sound of shoes on carpet, security chain on the door ratteling, the detail is amazing and enjoyable and surprising.The music is excellent. Ranging from a 13 year old Wayne Newton singing ""Danka Shoen"" to an alternate version of ""More Than This"" (made famous by 10,000 Maniacs) the music is again, detailed, enjoyable, and surprising. Also, the music intrudes on the movie just enough. Enough to notice and augment the action, but not enough to become a distraction.The editing and direction are excellent and done in a way that is ""art"" rather than simply ""getting the job done."" During the time when Roy was waiting for Angela at the park, there was a rapid fire succession of images. My first thought was it was like a computer program, following a logical and methodical process at lightning speed to deliver the intended effect. Not bad, but, hmmm, not exactly. Other thoughts I had about this scene were collage, montage, music video, mosaic, or painting. I'm not sure exactly how to describe it, but it was incredible and I appreciate this kind of effort in today's movie making climate.I give this movie a 9 because it was excellent, but it did not have the inspiring effect on me that I require to award a 10.

The whole thing is skilfully done and a delight.When Roy flushes his meds down the sink, he becomes a wreck; eventually, his partner comes and sorts him out, and hooks him up with a psychiatrist.The psychiatrist persuades him to touch base with his ex wife, and he finds out about a daughter whom he had never met. Enter the daughter - of course. She wins his heart and turns out to be a girl after his own leanings.There are so many little insights into the characters' psyches that this movie is a delight.

It did only fairly well at the boxoffice and was ignored at the yearend's awards feeding frenzy. This clever, subversive thriller from director Ridley Scott [""Gladiator"", ""Alien""] is a delight from start to finish. If it has a fault, it is that a plot twist near the end is so surprising and cruel that it was necessary to tack on a happy ending; however, said ending is both appropriate and logical, since the underlying theme is one of redemption.Roy Waller [Nicolas Cage] is a lifelong con artist. He is a mass of nervous ticks, a walking definition of obsessive-compulsive disorder. His partner, Frank [Sam Rockwell] is calm, cool and collected. He puts up w Roy because Roy, is the master con. When Roy goes to a new shrink, it occurs to him that he may have had a child by his ex-wife fourteen years ago. The doctor verifies that he did, and Roy searches out the child, a bright, vivacious girl named Angela [Alison Lohman]. Father and daughter instantly bond.

Ridley Scott, in a departure from his usual action fare, directs this idiosyncratic ""dramedy"". The cast is all superb. Nobody does nervous ticks like Nicholas Cage, even though I'm tired of seeing him do them. Part of the trouble with this film comes from some confusion in its tone: It might have been a brooding character study, but director Scott wanted it to be a black comedy. Good call, but the film isn't funny enough to captivate the audience on that level. It doesn't impress as a character study because all of the characters are annoying. That's played for laughs, but doesn't consistently succeed because the film is just so self-absorbed. Black comedy or character study aside -which is where you will find them- ""Matchstick Men"" is a Grift Movie. And the grift works. It's a good one, and this is where ""Matchstick Men"" is successful. This is a good-looking film; I like the cinematography and production design. The performances are impressive. But it's a little rough to sit through (The second half is better than the first, so don't give up too soon). It just doesn't come across as it should. I recommend ""Matchstick Men"" to fans of grift movies and fans of Nic Cage, but I don't think its successes are going to outweigh the tedium for anyone else.The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary entitled ""Tricks of the Trade"", an audio commentary by director Ridley Scott, screenwriter Nicholas Griffin, and  screenwriter/producer Ted Griffin, and  a theatrical trailer. ""Tricks of the Trade"" has three parts: pre-production, production, and post-production, and includes interviews with Ridley  Scott, the film's casting director, writers, producers, author Eric Garcia, and Hans Zimmer, who composed the film's score. It follows the making of ""Matchstick Men"", step-by-step, through all stages of production, which is plodding and tedious, but it gives a realistic picture of the movie-making experience instead of concentrating on eventful highlights. I think the documentary will bore most viewers, but film students might find it educational. The audio commentary is good but a little awkward, because Ridley Scott and the Griffin brothers seem to have taped their contributions at different times. They talk about the genesis of the film and storytelling decisions that were made along the way, but not technical stuff. Ridley Scott's contributions are especially interesting.

Over the years, they have become very successful pulling small time cons and have put together a very lucrative partnership. Unfortunately, Roy's private life is a mess. He has a obsessive-compulsive disorder and is borderline agorophobic, which is the fear of leaving his home. Due to his profession and personal problems, he has never been able to get close to anyone but his partner Frank, and he is slowly beginning to lose it. When his personal problems begin to spread into his professional life, Roy's partner Frank convinces him to see a psychologist. Unfortunately when Roy ventures into therapy, the doctor brings Roy to the realization that he longs to become closer to his 14 year old daughter that he abadoned at birth. To make matters worse, 14 year old Angela ( Alison Lohman) wants to meet the father she never knew she had. At first, Roy's routine is thrown out of whack by Angela's appearance. But he soon begins to develop a bond with her. Things become even more interesting however, when Angela discovers her father is a con-man, and wants to learn the tricks of the trade.&quot;Matchstick Men&quot; is easily one of the best films of 2003, and one of the best that I have seen overall. Everything about this film is absolutely fantastic. It combines elements of a con artist film with all of the twists and the turns, with a touching and loving story about a father getting to know his daughter. Mixing these two things together provides for a very well rounded story. I have seen many of Nicholas Cage's films, but he gave the best performance of his career in &quot;Matchstick Men&quot;. He absolutely nailed every apsect of the character with all of the different ticks and other obsessions. The reason I was so impressed, is because he is able to switch off from being a neurotic mess, to a smooth con-artist very easily. He played both roles great. Alison Lohman was amazing in this film and deserves a lot of credit. She is 25 in real life, and played a 14 year old girl very skillfully. Sam Rockwell also puts in a top notch performance as well.

791741,A1E15WYG9C47X1,B00012QLAA,"""mobby_uk""","[2, 3]","After directing some of the best Hollywood blockbusters,  Gladiator and Blackhawk Down, and having few flops along the way, G.I Jane, and Black Rain, Ridley Scott returns with Matchstick Men to a more intelligent, and much gentler character based movie making,the type of which he has excelled in Thelma and Louise.I had no expectations about Matchstick Men, and while yet another 'con' movie would not have been a reason to watch it, the names Scott and Cage certainly compelled me to 'check it out' and I am so glad I did, because I can confidently say it is one of the best movies I have seen in the last two years, a film that I liken to a fine glass of wine, taken in few sips, and the after effects will be totally relaxing, and soothing.The film while at the first glance does not seem to offer a lot, will grow on you unexpectedly and you'll carry it with you long after the credits roll.And this is because of a fine collaborative effort from an excellent book by Eric Garcia, brilliant screenplay by Nicholas Griffin, a totally involved and sympathetic direction by Scott, and of course a mind blowing acting by Nick Cage, who yet again after Adaptation proves that he is more than capable of pulling off some of the most complex characters in cinema.Alison Lohman too proved more than capable of playing her equally complex character, an actress that has matured very well on screen.The story of Matchstick Men seems simple enough, a phobic and neurotic Cage with a partner (Sam Rockwell) are small time con artists, who make their living by swindling housewives and lonely gullible men.His carefully constructed world though will soon collapse with the reappearance of a long lost daughter,who will force him to break the wall he has built around himself, brick by difficult brick,and face emotions and intimacies he thought he was unable to have.He goes through great personal turmoil in reestablishing his relationship with his 'daughter' who is interested in learning the trick of her dad's trade, while striving in the process to go straight.However, one last big con seems to ruin every hope or plan he had for his and his daughter's future.Simple enough, until the twist at the end  when the final truth  is revealed,which came as a complete shock to me!I loved how the change in Cage came about,how the neurosis which haunted his every move behavior and thought, were slowly undone one by one ,until he finally finds the peace of mind he so longed for.The cons in my opinion are really trivial to the whole film and do not matter as much as Cage's transformation and realizations.At the end , it did not matter to me who that daughter really was, because she was able directly and indirectly to give Cage the break that he needed to change his life.The ending was so serene and almost spiritual yet is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a while, because it says so much with so little language or explanations.Matchstick Men therefore is a must see movie, one that will gently affect you by its top acting, writing and a director who can dazzle viewers with big productions but can also engage their minds and hearts with the simplest but most creative style.",5,The Other Side Of Ridley Scott.,1078790400,"03 9, 2004",2004,3190,"['directing', 'best', 'Hollywood',

Alison Lohman who is really over 22 in real life is great and believable as the innocent 14 year old daughter of Nic's character. This movie is done in the same light tone as ""Catch Me If You Can,"" the only difference being that it is way better. The only small problem I have with the movie is the cheesy tacked on ending that follows the words..ONE YEAR LATER. I would actually suggest leaving the theater instead of watching the last 10 mins. The original ending ends on a depressing but realistic note following a series of plot twists, which was great for me. The tacked on ending is too sappy and detracts from realism of the characters we have gotten to know over the past 2 hours.

791743,A17BUW5ZP7J7HA,B00012QLAA,Mr. Cj Jothi,"[2, 3]","Ridley Scott has never instilled confidence in me when I watch his films. Granted, his visual flair and ability to handle exceptionally grand subjects is a virtue I would not take for granted. But whilst films like Alien, Blade Runner, Black Rain and Thelma and Louise remain standards of their respective genres his recent work has almost diluted into typical Hollywood fare that one could confuse with a number of different directors. For differing reasons I have found the following films, 1492, White Squall, GI Jane, Gladiator, Hannibal and Black Hawk Down, to be extremely disappointing. Now I for one am glad so many people have enjoyed these films, and I would rather be one of you than merely pass on watching them again. I won't delve into my gripes with each film, as this review is about one that I have no gripes for at all; Matchstick Men.Something is wildly attractive when a film combines the acting talents of Cage and Rockwell, and the visionary director Ridley Scott (who seems to find the best work in Hans Zimmer and his DOP of recent choice, John Mathieson). It is a small story on scale compared to Scott's other work. Far smaller, yet for me one that packs a far greater punch.In a nutshell the film is about a conman, one who is afflicted with an OCD that puts his partner on edge. To his surprise, his daughter of 14 years old, whom he never knew existed, crashes into his life. What follows is a combination of great comedy and drama that really refreshes your mind when lined up against recent Hollywood fare (and should have been recognised in a number of categories of recent award ceremonies).Take my word for it when I say this film is a technical triumph. The cinematography, editing, sound, costumes and sets work beautifully to create a comedy that impresses you with its visceral beauty and often leaves you cold with some harsh realities. The music, by Hans Zimmer, augments the visuals, much alike John Williams' score in Catch Me If You Can, by providing a lurid energy that supports the eccentricities of the two lead actors. Then in Alison Lohman the audience is enraptured by a sweet young actress, reminding you of the initial promise of Natalie Portman. And finally, the main man himself, Ridley Scott. To ignore his profound understanding of visuals and mise en scene would be to deny this film of one of its greatest virtues. It really is a sight to behold at times, begging to be frozen at times just so you can see how light bounces of objects, the colour varies and the actors move around the sets. His films will always have that quality (even GI Jane) but finally here he allows the actors to simply perform a quirky, heartfelt and wonderfully zippy script. The film is not without its flaws, but a film of this nature rarely is. I enjoyed the final scenes, whereas some people found it to be a disappointing resolution. Regardless, it still entertains on a high level.And now the DVD. Having been accustomed to these shiny discs since they made their way to England in the late 90s I have been able to form an idea of what the best DVD is. It isn't about the quantity; the numerous deleted scenes (honestly, half the time they are completely unnecessary), trailers, music videos, bloopers, EPKs. The 'Making Of' featurettes are almost always dry, either too short or too long, lacking insight and are usually press promos that you wonder why they even bothered in the first place. It's about two things; quality, and a blimming commentary track. Now a commentary track does not have to include the director (however, clearly the most important person when it comes to talking about the craft and meaning of a film). But when a film is subject to months of preparation, shooting and post, then clearly people will have a great deal to divulge. Commentaries seem to reveal the most about a film, and thankfully here we have the director, a writer and writer/producer talking over the film. Commentaries of course vary in quality, and here we have a very good one. Rarely reaching the self-congratulatory tones often trod on, the filmmakers speak about the film as mature adults should; with a balanced reverence (or pride) and objectivity that allows them to evolve as artists.Then you have what is arguably, as the amazon reviewer states, one of the best DVD features yet made. From prep to post, 'Tricks of the Trade' is a long, detailed, off-the-wall look into the making of this film. With seemingly full co-operation with everyone on board, this documentary pretty much covers all the main factors of filmmaking (scouting locations, casting, choosing crew, safety on set, writing, adapting from original texts, acting, costumes, set design, editing, testing on audiences, writing music, and naturally, when things go wrong). Just the nature of the doc gives you a wonderful insight into the industry. The ill-conceived notion that making big budget films is a breeze, where people are over paid turning up in their limos is challenged here. Everyone works extremely hard, being as professional as can be to work to a schedule and produce work of an incomparable standard (or, you don't get hired next time). An interesting part of this films creation is during post where Hans Zimmer has to completely re-write his original score as it completely changed the film's intended tone. One criticism is the film ignores the sound editing process, which is a shame as the sound in this film greatly enhances the storyline and the characters. Ultimately 'Tricks of the Trade' shows that the director is a genius. A Ridley Scott set seems to be one of the best to work on in Hollywood at the moment, and this film and documentary shows you why.The picture and sound transfers are excellent. Wonderful sound mix (extremely atmospheric, classic sound track, crisp dialogue) and the visuals are true to the cinematographer's achievement.So all in all a great package. A film that has already become underrated, Scott's best work in the past ten years is in my opinion destined to become a film fan's best kept secret. Enjoy.",5,An excellent film.

Cage plays Roy's each and every tic and quirk beautifully and the part gives him room to move and flex without becoming overbearing, over the top.  Cage's life get a tad bit more complicated (as lives do at times), when his daughter turns up, his partner wants to up the con ante, and Roy enters into psychotherapy.

And his acting is standardfare, for what we've come to expect from Cage, solid acting, and afull day's pay  for an honest day's work.At the same time, several conclusions can be drawn from this movie.The first, is that it severely lacks intensity in terms of thestory, and much of the supporting acting. Secondly, it is filmed,and the story unfolds, much like in  a low budget TV production,despite some quality filming elements, from time to time. Third,that creating, writing a script, and filming it, takes a lot of hardwork, and rare talent, and only a small percentage of picturesactually are successful and leave an impression of average to highquality; it's tough work, and the effort must not be underestimated.What occurs with MATCHSTICK MEN, is that the entire movie is a messfrom the story point of view, and from a spectator's view too.Other elements, than those mentioned, are perhaps more subjective,and I won't hold it against the makers, such as weaving a grown-manand child relationship, into a story featuring a small time grifter,played by Cage, who himself, doesn't really come across, in terms ofpersonality, as one, as compared to, perhaps, other movies. I thinkthe child-grown man relation was an absurd invention.Another absurd device, used in this movie, is that it seems toliterally serve  an advertisement for psychotherapy, for Pfizer andother pharmaceutical companies, considering the emphasis of thismovie on the leading perpetrator taking pills throughout the 90mins.Another unnecessary element, was soliciting sympathy for the maingrifter, on account of his own personal emotional demons, andphysical illnesses, and his need to take medication constantly, forpsychological remorse on his activities.All these elements, combined with a confused story, add up as awreck in terms of a movie, despite all the best, hard work and bestintentions, from Cage and other actors, in trying to make thisproject appealing. The script simply had too many flaws, and thefilming too much TV-like, and the actors, lacking intensity,throughout.

So while this movie does tell the story of a con job, in the end, that's just a tale within a tale.There's depth here, and despite an &quot;art film&quot; appearance, this is actually a touching and powerful story.  I'm carefully choosing my words throughout this review so as not to give away what happens, but suffice to say, by the end, I was in turn laughing, sitting in stunned silence, and grinning from ear to ear.If &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; has any flaw, it's the artsy surface.  It adds flavor, but it also adds distance.  The story is so well told that this distance is traversed excellently by the time you reach the perfect ending, however, and the overall sacrifice (keeping us a little detached in favor of making the film feel unique and decidedly uncommercial) is, in my opinion, worthwhile.

791759,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00012QLAA,Samuel McKewon,"[0, 0]","""Matchstick Men"" is film noir with a heart of gold, and it is worse off for its generosity. Ostensibly the tale of an obsessive/compulsive con man (Nicolas Cage) and a newly formed, world-shattering (for him) relationship with his 13-year-old daughter (Alison Lohman), Ridley Scott's film works toward something bigger, which, when revealed, is a fairly sharp right turn.Imagine, then, an epilogue that turns just as sharply back to the left - duping the dupe, if you will - and you've approximated how ""Matchstick Men"" unfurls in its final 20 minutes. A cheat of a cheat is even dirtier than the real thing.Back in a role that best fits his showboat antics, Cage is Roy, a barely functioning LA huckster who scams retirees with a showboat his equal, Frank (Sam Rockwell), who pines to play a large-sum con that Roy, millions in bank, doesn't need. Just how Roy has survived years of panic attacks brought on by loose carpet fibers and hamburger crumbs is left unsaid, but for the time being he pops illegal anti-depressants, until, during a fit, he loses them down the sink drain.See a shrink, Frank helpfully suggests, going so far to ""give him a name"" of an amiable, soft-bellied practitioner (Bruce Altman) who gently nudges Roy to connect with Angela, a daughter he's never known, played by Lohman with a intelligence beyond, shall we say, her 13 years. Angela is like a serum for Roy's ailments - she so completely obliterates his home upon her first visit he can't help but submit to a cure.It tricks him into accepting two things:  Frank's score and a vortex of trust toxic to a game grifter.A literate, a-bing-bang-boom script from Ted and Nicolas Griffin, based on Eric Garcia's recent novel, is slightly short on originality -every con there is has been played on the big screen, after all - but long on speed and tight dialogue; it doesn't feature a wide cast, but draws clearly the principals.Cage has generally been at his best when uninhibited, and Roy provides him the chance to play the gamecock dandy for all its worth: He struts and stutters and smokes and sweats so effectively, the audience is engaged in a kind of transference. Scott presents early panic scenes with such clarity and urgency that Angela's entrance in Roy's life works on us as much as it does Roy.And Lohman, at 23, is terrific at the cute, smart kid, as good here as she was in ""White Oleander;"" that the father/daughter dynamic works at all is thanks to her performance, partially by design, when you think about it.  Rockwell is the goofy cowboy sidekick laying his own odds. And I like Altman as the shrink, in a more important role in the film than it seems.The twist of ""Matchstick Men"" is there to see, but not in plain view; Scott plays to our growing distrust of the grift (and Angela) with a series of red flags that nevertheless don't diminish the stomach-panging moment the switch is flipped. Upon that scene's arrival, the movie has reached a suitable, logistic close, but an epilogue, following the title card ""One Year Later,"" presents a pretty fishy (Who are we kidding? It's unbelievable) resolution to Roy's ""journey of discovery."" Quentin Tarantino has his own issues with his ""Kill Bill,"" but I suspect he would have known how to put a final, crushing spin on the story without sacrificing the essential nature of a well-acted character.",3,Fishy ending dims Cage and Lohman's fantastic work,1065916800,"10 12, 2003",2003,3346,"['Matchstick', 'Men', 'film', 'noir', 'heart', 'gold', 'worse', 'off', 'generosity', 'Ostensibly', 'tale', 'obsessive/compulsive', 'con', 'man', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'newly', 'formed', 'world-shattering', 'relationship', '13-year-old', 'daughter', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'film', 'something', 'bigger', 'when', 'revealed', 'fairly', 'sharp', 'right', 'turn.Imagine', 'then', 'epilogue', 'just', 'sharply', 'back', 'left', 'duping', 'dupe', 'will', ""'ve"", 'approximated', 'how', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'unfurls', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'cheat', 'cheat', 'even', 'dirtier', 'real', 'thing.Back', 'role', 'best', 'showboat', 'antics', 'Cage', 'Roy', 'barely', 'functioning', 'LA', 'huckster', 'who', 'retirees', 'showboat', 'equal', 'Frank', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'who', 'play', 'large-sum', 'con', 'Roy', 'millions', 'bank', ""n't"", 'need', 'Just', 'how', 'Roy', 'survived', 'years', 'panic', 'attacks', 'brought', 'loose', 'carpet', 'fibers', 'hamburger', 'crumbs', 'left', 'unsaid', 'time', 'being', 'illegal', 'anti-depressants', 'fit', 'down', 'sink', 'shrink', 'Frank', 'helpfully', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'give', 'name', 'amiable', 'soft-bellied', 'practitioner', 'Bruce', 'Altman', 'who', 'gently', 'Roy', 'connect', 'Angela', 'daughter', 'never', 'known', 'played', 'Lohman', 'intelligence', 'shall', 'say', '13', 'years', 'Angela', 'serum', 'Roy', 'ailments', 'so', 'completely', 'home', 'first', 'visit', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'submit', 'cure.It', 'accepting', 'two', 'things', 'Frank', 'score', 'vortex', 'trust', 'toxic', 'game', 'grifter.A', 'literate', 'a-bing-bang-boom', 'script', 'Ted', 'Nicolas', 'Griffin', 'based', 'Eric', 'Garcia', 'recent', 'novel', 'slightly', 'short', 'originality', '-every', 'con', 'been', 'played', 'big', 'screen', 'long', 'speed', 'tight', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'feature', 'wide', 'cast', 'clearly', 'principals.Cage', 'generally', 'been', 'best', 'when', 'uninhibited', 'Roy', 'chance', 'play', 'gamecock', 'dandy', 'worth', 'stutters', 'smokes', 'sweats', 'so', 'effectively', 'audience', 'engaged', 'kind', 'transference', 'Scott', 'early', 'panic', 'scenes', 'such', 'clarity', 'urgency', 'Angela', 'entrance', 'Roy', 'life', 'as', 'much', 'Roy.And', 'Lohman', '23', 'terrific', 'cute', 'smart', 'kid', 'good', 'here', 'was', 'White', 'Oleander', 'father/daughter', 'dynamic', 'works', 'thanks', 'performance', 'partially', 'design', 'when', 'think', 'Rockwell', 'goofy', 'cowboy', 'sidekick', 'laying', 'own', 'odds', 'like', 'Altman', 'shrink', 'more', 'important', 'role', 'film', 'seems.The', 'twist', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'there', 'see', 'not', 'plain', 'view', 'Scott', 'growing', 'distrust', 'grift', 'Angela', 'series', 'red', 'flags', 'nevertheless', 'do', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'stomach-panging', 'moment', 'switch', 'flipped', 'scene', 'arrival', 'movie', 'reached', 'suitable', 'logistic', 'close', 'epilogue', 'following', 'title', 'card', 'One', 'Year', 'Later', 'pretty', 'fishy', 'Who', 'are', 'kidding', 'unbelievable', 'resolution', 'Roy', 'journey', 'discovery', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'own', 'issues', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'suspect', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'how', 'put', 'final', 'crushing', 'spin', 'story', 'sacrificing', 'essential', 'nature', 'well-acted', 'character']",N/A

The movie stars Nicolas Cage and his close friend Sam Rockwell, and introduces audiences to Alison Lohman. The disc also includes some nice extras, such as Tricks of the Trade: Making Matchstick Men.A glance at early scenes reveals Roy Waller (Cage) as a conman with OCD. He's partnered with Frank (Rockwell) -- both pose as FBI to solicit account numbers and signatures to drain their marks. Franks adverse reaction to pills nearly sinks them. Frank also visits the supermarket to see Kathy (Kelley.)The routine Roy follows is disrupted when his medication falls down the drain at the kitchen sink and his condition confines him to the house. His source for the pills has also fled town; he needs a new shrink to write prescriptions. This is how we meet Dr. Harris Klein (Altman.)Caught in the plight of talking to Klein to score pills, Roy reveals details of an old marriage -- and that he may have a child he's never seen. The good doctor intervenes, and after some phone calls he arranges a meeting between twelve year old daughter Angela (Lohman) and Roy.His first meeting with the girl clicks, but she ruins a flimflam when she materializes on Roy's doorstep. He claims he's an antiques dealer, but leaving her alone in his house allows snooping (bundled cash, guns!) that uncovers lies. Frank and Roy also ensnare Chuck Frechette (McGill) at the Spearmint Rhino.Some of the outstanding scenes in Matchstick Men occur only after Angela and Roy get into an argument, and she persuades him to teach her a con. He explains the system of the con this way: 1. Never work near where you live, 2. Don't write anything down, and 3. Be flexible.The father and daughter pull off the con effortlessly, after visiting a convenience store (for a lottery ticket) and the laundromat to find a mark. There they run into a Little Old Lady (Grant) whom Angela quickly convinces to split the proceeds with because she's technically too young to gamble legally.In case you're worried, Roy makes his daughter return the money. The next several chapters find Frank and Roy trying to finalize a currency conversion scam they've plotted against strip-club owner Chuck. Roy also discovers that having a daughter has made him more attractive to Kathy, the sexy supermarket checkout woman.Crafty or not, when Roy rips Chuck off at the airport (using Angela as a distraction) things turn dicey. A dangerous chase through the parking garage ensues. Unfortunately, Angela was captured on CCTV in the bar; Roy also discovers her juvenile record after quizzing. Scared, Roy dumps Angela at her mother's.Klein comes into play again when Roy suffers another harrying OCD attack, and he's run out of pills. Since Klein is out of the office on weekends, Roy makes a mad dash to the DeSoto Pharmacy looking for Prefex tablets. The altercation with the pharmacists is one pinnacle of this DVD.Most of the cons pulled by Roy are safe, but after he's scammed Chuck out of $[...], Chuck turns up in Roy's tidy living room with a pistol pointed at Angela and Roy, and a bloodied, beaten Frank in tow. When a gun goes off, it's unbelievable who pulls the trigger.Essentially what happens next is that Chuck gets shot -- by Angela. Roy protects her by putting her in a car headed to her mother's, driven by Frank, with instructions for Frank to never return, because he intends to drive Chuck to the hospital and take the rap for the shooting.Now that you've heard about this heartwarming film with a wonderfully human twist ending, I hope you buy, rent or seek it out. Matchstick Men has proved to be one of Cage's more underappreciated efforts -- that's unfair since the emotion and the storytelling were so obviously clear.

To mess it further, all of the pretty suave turns in the movie were thrown to the dogs in an absolutely feel-good denouement...Other than that, this is a very watchable movie. The execution is brilliant, film students take note of the camerawork and the screenplay. Above all, Nick Cage is really the cornerstone of the movie's class, his potrayal of someone with a cleanliness (and darkness) OCD is the stuff that Oscars are handed out for.Some of the negative reviews talk of the morally challenged script. Well, I never for a moment felt that Cage's or Rockwell's characters were oblivious of their follies.

It was too slow paced, but the movie did have some interesting scenes, but then return to slow Ville again.  I did not consider this movie a comedy, even though there were some scenes that were humorous.  I considered the movie more of a drama.  I thought Sam Rockwell's character was not as developed as it could have been.  You knew he was a con artist, you knew he ""acted"" concerned for Roy's character, but that's all.  Nicholas Cage plays Roy, an obsessive compulsive con artist who teams up with his Partner Fran (Sam Rockwell) to con people out of their money.  They mostly go after old people who are so nave they pretty much GIVE their money without asking any questions.  Roy can't stand being outdoors and can't stand unorganized dirty rooms as he makes people take off their shoes before entering his house. He has problems keeping the pills that help him deal with his disorders.  When he does not take those pills, his ticks, and behavior gets even worse.  There is a scene in the movie after he discovers he does not have his pills he cleans his apartment for what seems like hours on end from top to bottom.  He cleans every square inch, and even uses a toothbrush to clean small areas that some people would not even bother cleansing.  Roy discovers he has a 14 year old daughter named Angela from a relationship he ended years before.  When he ended this relationship she the woman was pregnant with his child.  Angela wants to get to know her father.  They begin to form a relationship that starts off awkward, but eventually turns affectionate.  Angela begs her father to teach her how to con, and he agrees.  Yet after he shows her the ropes he makes her return the money.  Okay nice turn, but again hypocritical being he never returned money to any of the elderly people he conned.One con goes horribly wrong, and their lives are threatened by a con they tried to bilk.  An interesting twist at the end turns everything around and things which appear to be true, suddenly are not true after all. Before the movie ends the con gets conned, and he tries to rebuild his life.  The movie had potential, but it just loses in parts before it builds up again.  Nicholas having germphobia and agoraphobia was an interesting touch.  I thought watching him be compulsive would be annoying, but it was very intriguing.  Sheila Kelley's character, the grocery check-out clerk, had such a limited role she might as well not have been there.  I thought Alison Lohman played her role well.  She had me convinced she was a young 14 year old teenager with her youthful appearance.

Problem is, it doesn't have it.This is a theme explored several times in the past in film (most notably ""The Sting"", ""Thieves"" and the brilliant ""House of games"") and it's one that always provides an exciting vehicle for a director and scriptwriter as it portrays the small scale intelligence wars going on every day in our societies.In ""Matchstick Men"", N.Cage and his partner have a nice lil scheme going on, mostly ripping off people through telephone sale scams (but not only), a scheme that works like a dandy mostly because the 2 con artists are at the top of their game after years of practice and because of some well nurtured talent they both possess in acting out their bogus schemes.Cage is a show in its own to watch as he plays a character who's extremely obsessive/compulsive and who's got a massive repertoire of facial ticks to burden him as well. It's a return to good performances for Cage who has appeared in a few not too memorable flicks recently, but here he simply shines.The plot follows these 2 as they pull off their frauds, until things take a very twisty turn. What that is i'd rather not describe since it would totally spoil the film for those who haven't seen it (much like describing the catch of the ""Usual suspects"") but the problem lies exactly in that twist.In order for the film to have been flawless it was essential that its twist is believable, well thought-out and carefully presented. Instead, the catch of the film has many flaws, or rather premises which are seriously stretched and which recquire from you to ignore their inplausibility in order for the film to ""do it"" for you. I, for one, could't ignore those stretches and thus it was a mixed affair for me, but even so, ""Matchstick Men"" still remains a very good film.Aside from Cage's often hilarious but tragic as well character, the rest of the characters have a distinct second seat to him, but this is a film set for an one-man show and that what it essentially is. The directing, as expected from someone in Riddley Scott's caliber, is great and the overall pace doesn't let down as it keeps you watching knowing that something is building up.It's a pity really for the scriptwritting shortcomings because there was potential for a truly great film here.

Things become complicated when he meets the daughter he never knew he had (Alison Lohman), and she begins to show an interest in the skill of cons.The acting in this film is superb, and the casting is absolutely perfect. Nicholas Cage, who has made some awful movies in his day, returns to the form of &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; and &quot;Adaptation&quot;, mastering all the ticks and nuances of his character, who is afflicted with numerous disorders, including obsessive-compulsive. Sam Rockwell shows again why he is becoming one of the more sought-after actors out there, as this is the third movie I have seen him shine in, after &quot;Welcome to Collingwood&quot; and &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;. He could be one of the greatest actors in a few years time, because he plays every character with such an irresistable charm and sense of humour. Also, I cannot say enough about the beautiful Alison Lohman. Don't worry, it's okay that I say that, because she is actually 24 years old, despite the youthful characters she always plays. She showed us in &quot;White Oleander&quot; that she was going to be great, and she continues that in &quot;Matchstick Men&quot;. As the daughter, she plays a hardened girl washed over with the innocence of youth, and the confusion between disliking her mother and just only meeting her long estranged father.The writers of this movie did an excellent job in creating great chemistry between the characters, brought out in the strong performances by the actors. The partner relationship of Cage and Rockwell is excellent, as there is a mutual respect and friendship between the two men. But the real prize here is the father-daughter chemistry crated by Cage and Lohman, which is dead-on. With both of them nailing their performances, their interaction seemed completely normal and seamless.Although the plot here may be a tad predictable, as most heist/con movies tend to be, but Scott's directing allows us to enjoy this film until the end. I have heard some people complain about the ending, saying that it should have ended before the &quot;One year later...&quot; part, but I don't know about that, because the ending allows the characters to come full-circle, showing that they are whole people in the end, and that there can be forgiveness to all their deceit and pain.Overall, &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; is a must-see movie, because it gives us all the elements of a great film, starting with the director and the solid script and ending with the great performances by some great actors.",4,Great con film,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,2857,"['Ridley', 'Scott', 'once', 'again', 'delivered', 'excellent', 'movie', 'reassuring', 'might', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'little', 'doubt', 'string', 'success', 'quot', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'quot', 'con', 'comedy', 'man', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'who', 'finally', 'go', 'big', 'score', 'partner', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'become', 'complicated', 'when', 'daughter', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'show', 'interest', 'skill', 'cons.The', 'acting', 'film', 'superb', 'casting', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'who', 'made', 'awful', 'movies', 'day', 'returns', 'form', 'quot', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'quot', 'quot', 'Adaptation', 'quot', 'mastering', 'ticks', 'nuances', 'character', 'who', 'afflicted', 'numerous', 'disorders', 'including', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'again', 'why', 'becoming', 'one', 'more', 'sought-after', 'actors', 'there', 'third', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'shine', 'quot', 'Welcome', 'Collingwood', 'quot', 'quot', 'Confessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', 'quot', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'few', 'years', 'time', 'character', 'such', 'irresistable', 'charm', 'sense', 'humour', 'Also', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'beautiful', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'okay', 'say', 'actually', '24', 'years', 'old', 'youthful', 'characters', 'always', 'showed', 'quot', 'White', 'Oleander', 'quot', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'quot', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'quot', 'daughter', 'hardened', 'girl', 'washed', 'innocence', 'youth', 'confusion', 'disliking', 'mother', 'just', 'only', 'meeting', 'long', 'estranged', 'father.The', 'writers', 'movie', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'creating', 'great', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'brought', 'out', 'strong', 'performances', 'actors', 'partner', 'relationship', 'Cage', 'Rockwell', 'excellent', 'mutual', 'respect', 'friendship', 'two', 'men', 'real', 'prize', 'here', 'father-daughter', 'chemistry', 'crated', 'Cage', 'Lohman', 'dead-on', 'nailing', 'performances', 'interaction', 'seemed', 'completely', 'normal', 'seamless.Although', 'plot', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'tad', 'predictable', 'most', 'heist/con', 'movies', 'tend', 'be', 'Scott', 'directing', 'enjoy', 'film', 'end', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'complain', 'ending', 'saying', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'quot', 'One', 'year', 'later', 'quot', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ending', 'characters', 'come', 'full-circle', 'showing', 'are', 'whole', 'people', 'end', 'can', 'be', 'forgiveness', 'deceit', 'pain.Overall', 'quot', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'quot', 'must-see', 'movie', 'elements', 'great', 'film', 'starting', 'director', 'solid', 'script', 'ending', 'great', 'performances', 'great', 'actors']",N/A

However he considers himself to be a con ""Artist,"" that is, he doesn't take people's money by force. He also absolutely despises harsh language, instead of using any bad word he simply says, ""Oh Pygmies!""He is also obsessive compulsive; his rituals include closing and opening doors three times in a row while saying the numbers out loud, and sometimes even in a different language. He lives on keeping his carpet clean, sometimes reminding people three or four times to always take off their shoes before they step on the carpet.Roy's world is turned upside down when he realizes that his ex wife's 14 year old daughter [Allison Lohman] heard about him trying to talk to her mother and wants to meet him. In the few awkward moments that he meets his daughter, Roy feels drawn to her, in a sort of protective father figure.I found that the relationship with Roy and Angela, his daughter, was very heartwarming, and genuine. A father trying to make up for 14 years of not growing up with her, and a girl who is curious about her father's past and what he does, and also acts as a rebellious child. [But all teens act like that]It doesn't take long for Roy to start taking Angela on some of his cons to teach her after being pressured into it by her to begin with. One very good scene involves an old lottery ticket that won 600 bucks, only to have a woman give 300 to Angela for finding the ticket. But Roy's responsible parent comes into play and makes Angela give the money back.This is a great movie, one of the best of Nicholas Cage's career. His portrayal as a man who is desperate to be a father and to make his life simple is brilliant.

Adapted from the novel written by Eric Garcia, ""Matchstick Men"" is a hidden gem that did not receive much critical consideration or buzz, but will undoubtedly make you laugh and think at the same time.Roy (Cage) is a virtuoso con-man who is overwhelmed by his psychological disadvantages that consist of agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder; he is very monetarily successful, but his problems have left him with no social acquaintances except his partner Frank (played by Sam Rockwell), a devastating divorce, and an increasing dependence on his psychologist (Bruce Altman).  Amidst planning for their biggest score against a wealthy, unsuspecting mark (Bruce McGill), Roy's world is thrown upside down when a young fourteen year-old girl (Alison Lohman) steps through the threshold of his frantic world and claims to be the daughter that he has never met.  Roy is torn between making the biggest score of his live or changing his ways and perspectives to focus more on his newfound relationship with the young woman.  Surprisingly to Roy, his daughter has an incredible knack for the dubious crimes that he and Frank are accustomed to committing-prompting Roy to include her in their con scheme.Director Scott creates a hip, energetic film with similar undertones to his 1991 film ""Thelma and Louise"", using some excellent dialogue and twists and turns to create an intellectual comedic caper that sniffs similarities of ""The Sting"".  Nicholas Cage is very good in his role as the neurotic crook, but his engaging relationship with the stand-out Lohman makes the film very entertaining.  A film that will certainly stimulate the mind and the funny bone-well worth the trip.  The 72-minute ""Tricks of the Trade"" is produced by Ridley Scott and is a very informative and interactive feature on the DVD, allowing viewers to parade through a variety of options, including interview segments, deleted scenes and ego-massaging.

An obsessive-compulsive agoraphobe with no personal relationships to call his own, Roy is barely hanging on to his wits, and when his idiosyncrasies begin to threaten his criminal productivity he's forced to seek the help of a psychoanalyst just to keep him in working order. While Roy is looking for a quick fix, his therapy begets more than he bargained for: the revelation that he has a teenage daughter, a child whose existence he suspected but never dared confirm. What's more troubling, 14-year-old Angela wants to meet the father she never knew. At first, Angela's appearance disrupts her neurotic father's carefully ordered routine. Soon, however, with his own unique spin on parenthood, Roy begins to enjoy a relationship he never dreamed of having with his daughter. But while he develops paternal feelings for the 14-year-old, she's developing a fascination with Daddy's questionable career. This is the kind of movie that will have you putting pieces together, long after it ends. It is an intriguing and rewarding movie, and shouldn't be missed.",5,Matchstick Men (Keepcase),1265673600,"02 9, 2010",2010,1613,"['Meet', 'Roy', 'Frank', 'couple', 'professional', 'small-time', 'con', 'artists', 'What', 'Roy', 'veteran', 'grift', 'Frank', 'ambitious', 'protege', 'are', 'swindling', 'days', 'are', 'water', 'filtration', 'systems', 'bargain-basement', 'water', 'filters', 'bought', 'unsuspecting', 'people', 'who', 'pay', 'ten', 'times', 'value', 'order', 'win', 'bogus', 'prizes', 'cars', 'jewelry', 'overseas', 'vacations', 'never', 'collect', 'scams', 'net', 'men', 'few', 'hundred', 'here', 'thousand', 'there', 'eventually', 'up', 'lucrative', 'partnership', 'Roy', 'private', 'life', 'however', 'not', 'so', 'successful', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'agoraphobe', 'personal', 'relationships', 'call', 'own', 'Roy', 'barely', 'hanging', 'wits', 'when', 'idiosyncrasies', 'begin', 'threaten', 'criminal', 'productivity', 'forced', 'seek', 'help', 'psychoanalyst', 'just', 'keep', 'working', 'order', 'Roy', 'looking', 'quick', 'fix', 'therapy', 'more', 'bargained', 'revelation', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'child', 'existence', 'suspected', 'never', 'dared', 'confirm', 'What', 'more', 'troubling', '14-year-old', 'Angela', 'meet', 'father', 'never', 'knew', 'first', 'Angela', 'appearance', 'neurotic', 'father', 'carefully', 'ordered', 'routine', 'Soon', 'however', 'own', 'unique', 'spin', 'parenthood', 'Roy', 'enjoy', 'relationship', 'never', 'dreamed', 'having', 'daughter', 'paternal', 'feelings', '14-year-old', 'developing', 'fascination', 'Daddy', 'questionable', 'career', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'putting', 'pieces', 'together', 'long', 'intriguing', 'rewarding', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed']",N/A

791777,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00012QLAA,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","Ridley Scott's ""Matchstick Men"" is best enjoyed seen NOT as a film about a con game -- the trick the film is trying to show is too incredible for me -- but seen as ""father-daughter"" drama it becomes more engaging.  And Alison Lohman is so good (far better than in ""White Oliander) that anyway you forgive some obvious flaws of the film.Nicolas Cage is a con man living in the sunshine-filled San Felnando Valley, where he and with his partner Sam Rockwell do their ""jobs"" getting easy money from unsuspecting people.  One unique thing about our Nick is, he is not only agoraphobia, but also obsessively urged to make everything clean -- he is a kind of a guy who keeps on vacuum-cleaning the carpet for hours.  So, he keeps a dog, the dog made of china.Then Allison Lohman, as his 14-year-old daughter newly-found, stumbles in his life, who literally litters snacks, and doesn't care if she lies on the couch with dirty shoes.  At first he panicks (why not), but he is then persuaded by her to take her under his wing, and even to make her a protege of his con game.As I said, the film gives us a surprising story, but it is not that story itself that really engage our attention.  It is the plausible and tenderly-depicted relations between Nick Cage and Alison Lohman, which develops in spite of (or because of) unusual situations.  Nicholas Cage's acting as caring father is very convincing, and so is Alison Lohman's slightly reckless and still lovable girl.Strangely I found his acting labored when Nicholas Cage shows tics on his face.  Obviously he is trying to give authenticity without offending the real-life people, but it is painfully clear that he is acting.  I do not disagree if you say his acting is good, but still it is artificial, and it shows.The greatest thing you find in ""Matchstick Men"" is Alison Lohman's delightful acting.

791779,A9OVXY24IY777,B00012QLAA,"""velurion""","[3, 4]","I bought Matchstick Men without having read the book, but I saw positive reviews, had seen and liked the trailer, and of course, knew that Ridley Scott directed. Well, I have to say, I was really engrossed for most of the film, but then the movie takes a turn that felt weird, and at the end I wished I had not seen it alone, so that I could instantly seek another viewer's opinion. I admit that I had trouble with the twists, because I think this movie works well without them, so to me they only got in the way. And unfortunately for you, it's difficult for me to point out the film's shortcomings (due to these twists) without revealing too much; so bare with me as skate the thin ice.The back of the DVD case explains this movie fairly accurately, and the movie's concept of slick con artist Roy (Nicholas Cage) and his partner Frank (Sam Rockwell), Roy's ticks and phobias, his discovering his long-lost daughter Angela (Alison Lohman), the subsequent complexity of Roy realising he is a father, should already make for interesting viewing for 116 minutes, wouldn't you say? So why add these twists?? Even the film's writer (see DVD extras) admits to having been annoyed by the book the movie is adapted from, and says his first draft re-write was a version with no twist, because he felt it was more satisfying to the reader/viewer. Sadly, his draft did not make the cut. At least I was not alone in my frustration.Most movies can be divided into 3 acts. And these movies often thrive in the first two, but struggle in the third act. Matchstick Men on the other hand has 4 acts. The first three here are strong, and are played straight, meaning that you are never given any hints or clues suggesting a potential twist (though, again, these scenes with clues did exist, but were cut from the film). At 90 minutes in - which is about the time when most movies are either already over or wrapping things up - we are presented with a new idea - this twist - but at this stage, we as an audience, have already invested so much into the characters, it's hard to willingly see them in a totally different light.Let me also say, that it's never very clear as to what genre movie Matchstick Men wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a character study? Is it a drama? In fact, you can't even look to the film-makers for answers, because not even they can agree on the style of film they were aiming for. Again, this all comes out in the excellent extras. You can really count on getting great honest insight in the DVD extras of a Ridley Scott film. And check out the commentary with Scott, and the two writers (Nicholas & Ted Griffin). Once you hear Scott's commentary, soooo much of the confusion and anger towards the 4th act goes away, and you suddenly learn to appreciate the film more. Enough to almost warrant 4 stars again. But to me, the movie has to get me the first time through. And that's why I just can't rate it higher. The acting is all-around really good, especially up-and-comer Alison Lohman. The music is by 7-time Ridley Scott collaborator Hans Zimmer, and I even had issues with the score, but that too is addressed in the special features section.Don't think that I didn't like this film because of the 3 star rating. I just feel that this movie wimped out by thinking it had to do a 360 to keep my interest. It's true that it works best at repeat viewings, and all the actors are great too, I just think it's strange that the overall enjoyment of the film requires the understanding of the back story that only the director himself provides in the DVD commentary. It's a plus point for the DVD, but not for someone who saw it at the cinema or plans to rent it for a quick thrill.",3,"First viewing itches, 2nd & 3rd viewings sooth",1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,3696,"['bought', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'saw', 'positive', 'reviews', 'had', 'seen', 'liked', 'trailer', 'course', 'knew', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'directed', 'Well', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'engrossed', 'most', 'film', 'then', 'movie', 'turn', 'felt', 'weird', 'end', 'wished', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'alone', 'could', 'instantly', 'seek', 'viewer', 'opinion', 'admit', 'had', 'trouble', 'twists', 'think', 'movie', 'well', 'so', 'only', 'got', 'way', 'unfortunately', 'difficult', 'point', 'out', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'due', 'twists', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'bare', 'skate', 'thin', 'ice.The', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'movie', 'fairly', 'accurately', 'movie', 'concept', 'slick', 'con', 'artist', 'Roy', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'partner', 'Frank', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Roy', 'ticks', 'phobias', 'discovering', 'long-lost', 'daughter', 'Angela', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'subsequent', 'complexity', 'Roy', 'realising', 'father', 'should', 'already', 'make', 'interesting', 'viewing', '116', 'minutes', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'So', 'why', 'add', 'twists', 'Even', 'film', 'writer', 'see', 'DVD', 'extras', 'having', 'been', 'annoyed', 'book', 'movie', 'adapted', 'first', 'draft', 're-write', 'was', 'version', 'twist', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'satisfying', 'reader/viewer', 'Sadly', 'draft', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'cut', 'least', 'was', 'not', 'alone', 'frustration.Most', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'divided', '3', 'acts', 'movies', 'often', 'thrive', 'first', 'two', 'struggle', 'third', 'act', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'other', 'hand', '4', 'acts', 'first', 'three', 'here', 'are', 'strong', 'are', 'played', 'straight', 'meaning', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'hints', 'clues', 'suggesting', 'potential', 'twist', 'again', 'scenes', 'clues', 'did', 'exist', 'were', 'cut', 'film', '90', 'minutes', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'already', 'wrapping', 'things', 'up', 'are', 'presented', 'new', 'idea', 'twist', 'stage', 'audience', 'have', 'already', 'invested', 'so', 'much', 'characters', 'hard', 'willingly', 'see', 'totally', 'different', 'light.Let', 'also', 'say', 'never', 'very', 'clear', 'what', 'genre', 'movie', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'be', 'comedy', 'character', 'study', 'drama', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'film-makers', 'answers', 'not', 'even', 'can', 'agree', 'style', 'film', 'were', 'aiming', 'Again', 'out', 'excellent', 'extras', 'can', 'really', 'count', 'getting', 'great', 'honest', 'insight', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'commentary', 'Scott', 'two', 'writers', 'Nicholas', 'Ted', 'Griffin', 'hear', 'Scott', 'commentary', 'soooo', 'much', 'confusion', 'anger', 'towards', '4th', 'act', 'away', 'suddenly', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'film', 'more', 'Enough', 'almost', 'warrant', '4', 'stars', 'again', 'movie', 'get', 'first', 'time', 'why', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rate', 'higher', 'acting', 'all-around', 'really', 'good', 'especially', 'up-and-comer', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'music', '7-time', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'collaborator', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'even', 'had', 'issues', 'score', 'too', 'addressed', 'special', 'features', 'section.Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'just', 'feel', 'movie', 'wimped', 'out', 'thinking', 'had', 'do', '360', 'keep', 'interest', 'true', 'best', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'just', 'think', 'strange', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'understanding', 'back', 'story', 'only', 'director', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'plus', 'point', 'DVD', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'saw', 'cinema', 'plans', 'rent', 'quick', 'thrill']",N/A

Roy's house, the muisc he listens to (Frank Sinatra) and his very essence has been imported from the early 60's into the 21st Century. Unfortunately, Roy lives a life trapped in routine; he suffers from an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive disorder caused by the way he lives his life; he's a flimflam man, a con man with more cons than a cardshark has aces up his sleeve. Roy's obsessive compulsive behavior and tics are out of control because his supplier of medication has skipped town. Without his illegally obtained medication, Roy is out of control and goes into extreme cleaning mode. He can't function and he can't work because his nervous ticks and behavior will give him away.His obnoxious and messy partner Frank (the marvelous Sam Rockwell) urges him to see a shrink.  Now he must see a real doctor and discuss his very real problems something very much against his nature. His new psychiatrist Dr. Klein manages to get Roy on the couch just long enough to discover that Roy has a daughter he's never seen and an ex-wife that has told more lies than she has fingers about his whereabouts. Dr. Klein urges Roy to contact his daughter suggesting part of his problems may be related to the fact that he has no one to relate to and leads a solitary, lonely life. Roy's life takes both a turn for the better and the worse as his daughter turns out to have a talent for conning all her own...&quot;Matchstick Men&quot; plays almost like a dysfunctional variation on &quot;The Sting&quot; with quirky, nebbish characters at its heart. Director Ridley Scott (&quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot;) shows he has a deft ability with comedy in this unique film.  His clever use of 60's and 50's stylistic touches and Cage's rich performance make &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; instantly memorable and enjoyable. All the members of the supporting cast are of an equal caliber. Rockwell steals many of the scenes he shares with Cage, which is quite an accomplishment, and Allison Lohman does a great job playing Roy's seemingly sweet but manipulative daughter. The plot features enough twists and turns for a high-grade roller coaster.  Kudos must also be given to screenwriters Nicholas and Ted Griffin for their sardonic and rich screenplay. While the audience can see where the film is leading well before the final third of the film creating sympathy for some very unsypathetic characters, Scott and his cast make the ride as entertaining as possible.The rich and colorful transfer of &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; looks exceptional. The warm colors of Southern California come across in the rich cinematographer by John Matheison and are faithfully reproduced on the DVD as well.Viewers won't get burned with the extras on this single disc, dual layer edition. There's an in-depth feature length documentary focusing on the entire process of making a motion picture. It's a fascinating glimpse into the process of making a motion picture for film fans.  There's also a interesting commentary track from Scott and the screenwriters.A funny, entertaining movie with some very cool and unique extras, &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; shows that Scott way with comedy. Cage, Rockwell, Lohman and McGill all give funny, detailed performances that are highlighted in the marvelous commentary as well as the production featurettes.

791781,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B00012QLAA,Wesley Mullins,"[1, 3]","People are saying TOO MUCH about this movie in their reviews.  Watching the film will be more enjoyable the less you hear about it before viewing.  But if you must read a review, here is mine (free of spoilers):Matchstick Men is one of the safest films to recommend in years.  While many people won't love it, almost everyone will enjoy it.  It is often funny, sometimes charming and always interesting.  Nicolas Cage plays a conman.  Much like in The Sopranos, his life is sorted into three areas: criminal activity, family and therapy.What makes this film different than most flim-flam films is that a film about Cage's character would be fascinating regardless of his profession.  He is obsessive compulsive, neurotic, depressed, unstable, etc.  Cage has the misfortune of following Jack Nicholson's turn as a similarly afflicted person in As Good As it Gets.  In his turn, Cage is no less convincing and brings a degree of humanity to the character that was missing from Jack's abrasive writer.I won't speak much about the plot of the film, but will only say his three worlds (job, family, therapy) constantly intersect and come together in a very satisfying ending.  The film has the look of a nice Armani  suit and is often accompanied by the smooth sounds of Sinatra.  Not to be missed is an Oscar-worthy supporting performance by Sam Rockwell as Cage`s understudy.Also featured on the DVD is a great commentary track by director Ridley Scott and writer Nicolas Griffin.  It is one of the most honest and forthcoming tracks I have ever heard.  They really do a fine job explaining the nuances of the script and give away a lot of reasons for decisions they made that many other artists would have kept secret.",5,Dont Read Any Reviews,1085184000,"05 22, 2004",2004,1716,"['People', 'are', 'saying', 'TOO', 'MUCH', 'movie', 'reviews', 'Watching', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'less', 'hear', 'viewing', 'must', 'read', 'review', 'here', 'mine', 'free', 'spoilers', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'one', 'safest', 'films', 'recommend', 'years', 'many', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'love', 'almost', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'often', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'charming', 'always', 'interesting', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'conman', 'Much', 'Sopranos', 'life', 'sorted', 'three', 'areas', 'criminal', 'activity', 'family', 'therapy.What', 'film', 'different', 'most', 'flim-flam', 'films', 'film', 'Cage', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'fascinating', 'regardless', 'profession', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'neurotic', 'depressed', 'unstable', 'etc', 'Cage', 'misfortune', 'following', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'turn', 'similarly', 'afflicted', 'person', 'As', 'Good', 'turn', 'Cage', 'less', 'convincing', 'degree', 'humanity', 'character', 'was', 'missing', 'Jack', 'abrasive', 'writer.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'speak', 'much', 'plot', 'film', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'three', 'worlds', 'job', 'family', 'therapy', 'constantly', 'intersect', 'come', 'together', 'very', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'film', 'look', 'nice', 'Armani', 'suit', 'often', 'accompanied', 'smooth', 'sounds', 'Sinatra', 'Not', 'be', 'missed', 'Oscar-worthy', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Cage', 's', 'understudy.Also', 'featured', 'DVD', 'great', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'writer', 'Nicolas', 'Griffin', 'one', 'most', 'honest', 'forthcoming', 'tracks', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'really', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'explaining', 'nuances', 'script', 'give', 'away', 'lot', 'reasons', 'decisions', 'made', 'many', 'other', 'artists', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'secret']",N/A

It's hard, after all, to care about the outcome of a story if its main characters are swindling scumbags who make their living by ripping others off. Let 'em be wiped off the face of the planet for all I care. But everyone universally praised the film and said it had a good ending that catches the viewer off guard, so I finally decided to check it out.Nicolas Cage's character, Roy, is crippled by obsessive-compulsion disorder, likely a physical consequence of the guilt of his criminal lifestyle, which he tries to justify (""I don't take money from people; they give it to me""). He sees a shrink and relies on meds to deal with his condition. Ultimately Roy and his partner (Sam Rockwell) happen upon a big score. At the same time his life is complicated but also blessed by the appearance of a 14 year-old daughter he never knew he had (alison Lohman).The story is good all the way through but the last act & epilogue in particular are worth the price of admission.I like how the movie emphasizes that love is more important than money, and more devastating to lose as well. And also that, if one truly has a worthy and noble heart, it will ultimately vomit out foolish, selfish and unnatural inclinations & actions. Redemption is always there, no matter how bad you are, but you have to want freedom enough to choose it and change.I don't want to say anymore because the less you know the better.The film runs two hours and was filmed in the Los Angeles/Anaheim/Venice areas.",4,You get what you give and (hopefully)... redemption,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,1628,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'released', '2003', 'was', 'reluctant', 'give', 'try', 'was', 'about', 'two', 'con-men', 'hard', 'care', 'outcome', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'swindling', 'scumbags', 'who', 'make', 'living', 'ripping', 'others', 'off', 'Let', 'be', 'wiped', 'face', 'planet', 'care', 'everyone', 'universally', 'praised', 'film', 'said', 'had', 'good', 'ending', 'viewer', 'guard', 'so', 'finally', 'decided', 'check', 'out.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'character', 'Roy', 'crippled', 'obsessive-compulsion', 'disorder', 'likely', 'physical', 'consequence', 'guilt', 'criminal', 'lifestyle', 'justify', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'money', 'people', 'give', 'shrink', 'relies', 'meds', 'deal', 'condition', 'Ultimately', 'Roy', 'partner', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'happen', 'big', 'score', 'same', 'time', 'life', 'complicated', 'also', 'blessed', 'appearance', '14', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'alison', 'Lohman', '.The', 'story', 'good', 'way', 'last', 'act', 'epilogue', 'particular', 'are', 'price', 'admission.I', 'how', 'movie', 'love', 'more', 'important', 'money', 'more', 'devastating', 'lose', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'one', 'truly', 'worthy', 'noble', 'heart', 'will', 'ultimately', 'vomit', 'out', 'foolish', 'selfish', 'unnatural', 'inclinations', 'actions', 'Redemption', 'always', 'there', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'are', 'have', 'want', 'freedom', 'enough', 'choose', 'change.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'anymore', 'less', 'know', 'better.The', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'filmed', 'Los', 'Angeles/Anaheim/Venice', 'areas']",N/A
