773795,A21XZF5ZHKK5EM,B0000C825E,"Antoinette Johnson ""Pooky""","[0, 1]","This is actually an alright show. It has the same animatian style as Aeon Flux. I must warn peaple though it is strange and confusing. I watched it twice and still I'm still lost on the mystery concerning the prophecy stating Alexander is going to destroy the world. You'll know what I mean on the last couple of episodes. Also don't watch this thinking its historically acurate representation of Alexander because its more of an historical fantasy. The show is also heavy in symbolism that can also be very confusing and mindf***ing. One in particular happens around episode 4 I think where it starts out with two Alexanders, A baby Alex and preteen Alex, in this room with dancing naked women and his mom standing in front of a fire with a giant python wraped around her. The snakes pick up baby Alexander and his mom tells him he will destroy the world than baby Alex is eaten by the big snake wrapped around his mom. It took me along time to figure out the baby was Alexander as a child and the preteen Alex was observing this happening. Confused yet? Another part that will lead peaple baffled is a scene with a short man who lives in a barrier. Alesx steps into the barrel and crosses into another universe. Even more confused? Well to be fair alot of this is based of Greek Mythology and historical thearies so to fully get into this you have to be a little bit familiar with ancient Greece. I also advise peaple to watch this subbed. The English version is just terribleXP The voice acting do none of the characters justice. The English version also edits alot of stuff out making an already confusing anime more confusing. This isn't bad show. I've seen worse ""coughIkkiTousencough""! Peaple who watch are gonna either love it or hate. I'm also gonna be honest and say I watched this on Youtube subtitled and really enjoyed it. If you love it go on and buy it because its really the kind of show you need to watch more than once to truely understand. You'll also enjoy its abridged series too :D",3,Mixed bag.

773800,A3S7REHVBOSTLR,B0000C825E,Toni V. Sweeney,"[0, 0]","If you're looking for historical accuracy in this epic...don't!  It sticks to the facts probably more than some Hollywood versions would have, but they seemingly get lost in the spectacle and scope of the sets.  If this is Macedonia and the then-civilized world, it's in a solar system far far away from Earth.I saw about 15 minutes of the first episode on Cinemax or some cable channel about 10 years ago and have been searching for it ever since.  Now that I've found it, I viewed it with mixed reactions.Alexander is definitely strong and silent. (He rarely speaks and never raises his voice except to give a battle cry). He's a man searching for that elusive something which even he can't name and at the end, I'm not sure he realizes he's find it or the significance of what it means.  The other characterizations are...interesting, to say the least.  With a mother like Olympias, who's defined as nothing more than a madwoman rejoicing that her son will destroy the world and egging him on, Alexander had to become famous in self-defense or shrink into a impenetrable sniveling shell.  His best friend-companion-supposed lover Hephaestion becomes someone who sticks close, plays the harp, and barely ever speaks. As for the others...famous names flying about but it was difficult to tell who was who under the SF garb,pseudo-scientific technobabble, and the El Greco-elongated artwork of the figures. No one fits the Grecian-Macedonian-Persian stereoytypes. Alexander and Hephaestion are almost pretty, his generals are ruggedly handsome, various followers and villains are grotesquely alien. No lovelife in this tale but all strife and fight with only 3 female characters...Cassandra (a female warrior), the aforementioned Olympias, and Roxane whom Alexander marries. No courtship...he comes upon her as she's bathing, steals her clothes to disguise himself from pursuers, then later finds her again after defeating the Persians, and that's it. Ho-hum, say ""I do"" and get off to the next battle.I was a little disappointed in the ending, actually demanding, ""Is that it?"" Then I got the brilliant revelation the finish was a metaphor, and the scene after the credits seemed to underscore that.I'd really like to sit in on a discussion-critique of this series and hear others' interpretations.All in all, despite the surrealism of dreams and flashbacks, the science fiction atmosphere, and the lack of historicity, I enjoyed it.  It was good to finally see the entire story. It's definitely an anime tour de force and reminds us why this media is definitely not for children. I recommend it as one of the better examples of anime. Just don't go into it expecting a history lesson. Instead, lean back and enjoy a flight into surreal, metaphorically-induced fancy.",5,Historically Accurate...to a point...but who cares?,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,2768,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'epic', 'do', ""n't"", 'facts', 'probably', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'versions', 'would', 'have', 'seemingly', 'get', 'lost', 'spectacle', 'scope', 'sets', 'Macedonia', 'then-civilized', 'world', 'solar', 'system', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'Earth.I', 'saw', '15', 'minutes', 'first', 'episode', 'Cinemax', 'cable', 'channel', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'been', 'searching', 'ever', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'found', 'viewed', 'mixed', 'reactions.Alexander', 'definitely', 'strong', 'silent', 'rarely', 'never', 'voice', 'give', 'battle', 'cry', 'man', 'searching', 'elusive', 'something', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'name', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'find', 'significance', 'what', 'other', 'characterizations', 'are', 'interesting', 'say', 'least', 'mother', 'Olympias', 'who', 'defined', 'nothing', 'more', 'madwoman', 'rejoicing', 'son', 'will', 'destroy', 'world', 'egging', 'Alexander', 'had', 'become', 'famous', 'self-defense', 'shrink', 'impenetrable', 'sniveling', 'shell', 'best', 'friend-companion-supposed', 'lover', 'Hephaestion', 'someone', 'who', 'close', 'harp', 'barely', 'ever', 'speaks', 'others', 'famous', 'names', 'flying', 'was', 'difficult', 'tell', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'SF', 'garb', 'pseudo-scientific', 'technobabble', 'El', 'Greco-elongated', 'artwork', 'figures', 'one', 'Grecian-Macedonian-Persian', 'stereoytypes', 'Alexander', 'Hephaestion', 'are', 'almost', 'pretty', 'generals', 'are', 'ruggedly', 'handsome', 'various', 'followers', 'villains', 'are', 'grotesquely', 'alien', 'lovelife', 'tale', 'strife', 'fight', 'only', '3', 'female', 'characters', 'Cassandra', 'female', 'warrior', 'aforementioned', 'Olympias', 'Roxane', 'whom', 'Alexander', 'marries', 'courtship', 'upon', 'bathing', 'clothes', 'disguise', 'pursuers', 'then', 'later', 'again', 'defeating', 'Persians', 'Ho-hum', 'say', 'do', 'get', 'off', 'next', 'battle.I', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'actually', 'demanding', 'Then', 'got', 'brilliant', 'revelation', 'finish', 'was', 'metaphor', 'scene', 'credits', 'seemed', 'underscore', 'that.I', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'sit', 'discussion-critique', 'series', 'hear', 'others', 'interpretations.All', 'surrealism', 'dreams', 'flashbacks', 'science', 'fiction', 'atmosphere', 'lack', 'historicity', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'good', 'finally', 'see', 'entire', 'story', 'definitely', 'anime', 'tour', 'force', 'why', 'media', 'definitely', 'not', 'children', 'recommend', 'one', 'better', 'examples', 'anime', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'history', 'lesson', 'Instead', 'lean', 'back', 'enjoy', 'flight', 'surreal', 'metaphorically-induced', 'fancy']",N/A

With that said, let me add that this takes more liberty with the story than most Hollywood epics while sticking to the main idea. Some of the characterizations were a over-the-top and little difficult to accept, such as Olympias, instead of merely an overly-ambitious mother, being a lunatic cackling at every turn and seemingly proud her son's destined to destroy the world. Alexander is hinted at being a devoted son or a mother's boy, take your pick, but the relationship between the two is more confusing since she derides him at every turn and he seems to accept it.Alexander himself is strong, silent, searching for something even he can't name, and appears only to come to life when in battle. Hephaestion, historically considered his BFF or closer, merely sits around plinking on a harp and rarely speaking and then in a high girlish voice. Nevertheless it is he who's the last one out of all Alexander's entourage to make the ultimate sacrifice for his friend. I was a little disappointed in the ending but assumed it was metaphorical although it did seem to get lost in the mathematical explanation that almost sounded like double talk to this math-illiterate.
