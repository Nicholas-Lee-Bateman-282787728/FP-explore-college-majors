In addition to the obvious hazards of such a living arrangement, Kate seems to have some paranoiac issues going on. When Jason's ex-girlfriend shows up, Kate begins to suspect the worst. Her mother in-law only makes things more tense. Then there's Kate's vast doll collection. She has a VERY strong attachment to them, especially the one she calls her ""guardian doll"", It's not long before strange sounds and mysterious occurrences start plaguing the couple. Is Kate's ""guardian doll"" behind the sudden weirdness? What does this all have to do w/ Kate's mother and stepfather? Is Kate's ""hormonal"" state the reason that she's been talking to her doll so much? If Jason's not careful, he just might find out! THE CREEPY DOLL is a low-budget horror film. In spite of its financial constraints, it manages to use a good storyline and decent characters to full effect. Also, allowing us to see through ""doll vision"" is a nice, unsettling touch.

I didn't find the acting to be that terrible, though it feels more like stage acting than movie acting.  There is a slight difference between the two.  Stage acting tends to be more emphasized and dramatic.The reason why I gave it three stars is because I was looking for a horror movie...and this movie is not a horror movie.  It is more a psychological movie that has some violence at the end.  Most of the movie deals with the pregnant girl's insecurity when she finds out her husband--who married her because he knocked her up--used to be engaged to a family friend.  She has entered a tight knit family and group of friends that have known each other for years.  She is also dealing with memories of being sexually abused, which seem to be worse now that she is pregnant.  And everybody is creeped out by her collection of dolls--particularly the doll shown on the cover--which her mother forced her to pack away (which she resents).Though they show the doll's face changing at the end, the doll really doesn't do much.

So glad I watched this via free Prime streaming instead of totally wasting $19.95 for the DVD!

I was hugely disappointed that there aren't any paranormal happenings in this movie because you kind of get set up to think that the doll is possessed, especially with all the shots from the doll's POV. The doll doesn't actually do anything the entire movie (ok, so it's face gets a little uglier at the end).  This is a homemade looking movie. The acting wasn't as bad as it could have been, but it's still pretty bad, some characters are worse than others.  The unleashing of passion in the office was hilarious.
