First, I am a devout Coen Brothers fan and have loved all of their work; however, this is the first movie I have viewed by them that was a disappointment.  I understand about the curse and I found it funny that the writer/director focused the movie on the curse very little.The characters were believable and it had my attention from start to end, however, there was just something it desperately lacked.  In many ways it didn't feel like a Coen Brothers movie and due to the many other great endeavors the brothers have achieved, this specific title just left a bad taste in my mouth.Perhaps it was the pace of the movie, maybe I was expecting another O Brother Where Art Thou or The Hudsucker Proxy, or maybe every genius is entitled to flop at one time or another, regardless I was entertained but left feeling senseless.I will give myself a few months and try this movie again but I sadly feel it will have the same results and I feel I'm forcing myself to like something that isn't my style.",1,Seriously?,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,1039,"['will', 'go', 'as', 'politely', 'can', 'First', 'am', 'devout', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'fan', 'have', 'loved', 'work', 'however', 'first', 'movie', 'have', 'viewed', 'was', 'disappointment', 'understand', 'curse', 'found', 'writer/director', 'focused', 'movie', 'curse', 'very', 'little.The', 'characters', 'were', 'believable', 'had', 'attention', 'start', 'end', 'however', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'desperately', 'lacked', 'many', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'movie', 'due', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'endeavors', 'brothers', 'have', 'achieved', 'specific', 'title', 'just', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth.Perhaps', 'was', 'pace', 'movie', 'maybe', 'was', 'expecting', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'Hudsucker', 'Proxy', 'maybe', 'genius', 'entitled', 'flop', 'one', 'time', 'regardless', 'was', 'entertained', 'left', 'feeling', 'senseless.I', 'will', 'give', 'few', 'months', 'try', 'movie', 'again', 'sadly', 'feel', 'will', 'have', 'same', 'results', 'feel', ""'m"", 'forcing', 'like', 'something', ""n't"", 'style']",A Serious Man

1264701,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002E2M5IC,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I've always said that The Coen Brothers were hit or miss with me.  They have some films that I absolutely adore and then there are a few that just leave me scratching my head.  The cult status for `A Serious Man' is one that leaves me, well, a tad dumfounded.  I don't really see the massive appeal, despite actually really liking a few aspects of the film (namely, Michael Stuhlbarg's tremendous performance).The film opens with a Jewish family killing a ghost and then moves right into a Jewish professor in 1967 Minnesota struggling with a slew of familial problems.  Yeah, I'm still trying to understand the point of the film's opening.  From there we learn of Professor Gopnik's wife's infidelity, his son's weed usage and his daughter's intentions for a nose job.  We learn of his brother's annoyance on others and the fact that he has not only a gambling problem but certain questionable activities.  We learn of his neighbor's apparent racism and their feud over land and we learn of his moral objections over a student's bribe.  All of this is well and fine except that Gopnik is such a push over that he's completely walked all over by everyone in his life to the point of paying for the funeral of his wife's lover.Seriously.I'm not saying that `A Serious Man' is a bad film, because it isn't, but it isn't a great one either.  If just doesn't say much, in my opinion, and the writing seems almost lazy in some respects, which may have actually been the intention.  The ambiguousness of the film's open and close (both of which seem a tad disjointed, the opening more than a tad actually) also hurt the film's overall appeal because it feels uneven and unfocused.  I'm not really quite sure WHAT the Coens wanted to say, so I'm not sure the film says anything at all.That being said, Michael Stuhlbarg commands with a perfected frazzling of his nerves and delivers a performance that I was not expecting.  He understands the black comedy aspects of the film and delivers in spades.

A SERIOUS MAN is patient, hilarious, sharp and honest, it questions the meaning of existence but seems to offer an answer as well, in a similar way that THE BIG LABOWSKI does.  Like the Dude the protagonist, Larry Gopnick is encouraged by others to seek answers and take himself seriously which only makes Larry more frustrated.  Larry tells the Rabbi's receptionist ""I am a..serious man"" when he is exactly the opposite.  This mirrors the Dude when he gets irate (very ""un-dude"") and quotes George Bush Sr by saying, ""this act of aggression will not stand...""  Maybe the Cohen brothers are suggesting that it should be enough to trust one's morals and seek life's meaning there and not get corrupted by an absurd society full of grudges, expectations and superstitions.  As they say in Labowski ""the dude abides.""  and in a Serious Man, the Rabbi says ""be a good boy.""In this film, the Cohen brothers have fun showing the absurdity of everything from math, law to religious ritual.  There is a sort of meaninglessness behind it all, in so far that the meaning fails to connect with the characters involved.  But there is also a tenderness and affection that Ethan and Joel have for their characters as well - more so than in BURN AFTER READING or NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.For the detractors...I pity those who think this film is stupid or a waste of time - you're missing out.PS.

The basic question of ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" is examined, dissected, and parodied beautifully here. In Job, God allows tragedy, disaster, and utter ruin to devastate Job, who happens to be one of the most righteous, upstanding men on Earth. Why? Because God is ""tempted"" by Satan to do so! Satan bets that Job will crack under enough pressure, and curse God. In other words, God allows Job's life to go down the toilet in order to prove that the devil is wrong. Of course, God knows the outcome before taking the bet, so Job is in good hands. Larry Gopnick is our modern, 1960s Job. He is stricken by divorce, terrible neighbors, death, and the Columbia record club! We watch as this physics professor's entire existence unravels around him. Will he crack? In Job, he is joined by three ""friends"" who mostly babble on about Job's apparent sinfulness in reference to his horrible predicament. In A SERIOUS MAN, the Coens use Rabbis.

The other 2 films being A Single Man (2009) and Solitary Man (2010). Are the studios trying to make it hard for us to distinguish these movies from each other?

1264706,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B002E2M5IC,B. Martin,"[2, 13]","A lot of words have been used to describe Joel and Ethan Coen's latest film:  dark, comedic, personal, philosphical, etc.  Here's another one:  pretentious; although I'm not sure that the Coen Brothers would be displeased with that description.  You have to respect the fact that they have made the movie that they wanted to with little regard to what critics or fans have to say.The movie focuses on Larry Gopnik, a physics professor living in Minnesotta in 1967 who finds himself the unwilling recipient of a number of crises.  His wife is leaving him, his brother is mooching off of him, his children have discipline problems and don't respect him, one of his students is trying to bribe him in order to receive a passing grade and he has neighbors who barely mask their contempt for his Jewish heritage.  In an attempt to try and find guidance and answers for what is happening, Larry seeks out the counsel of three rabbis.  Not surprisingly, they offer nothing other than glib generalizations that are meant to make them appear wiser than they really are.To me it seems that the main idea being tossed around here is the general randomness of life.  Why do bad things happen to decent people and do we have any control over what happens to us.  Larry's mantra seems to be ""I didn't do anything"", and indeed he is very passive throughout the entire film, looking to others for answers to his problems.  When he finally makes a decision in the films final act, even more bad luck seems to be dished out to him.  Why is Larry suffering?  Is it becasue of his lack of action?  Is he sealing his fate by accepting what happens to him?  Or does he have any control over his circumstances at all?  The movie offers no answers.Sounds profound, right?  The problem is that while it may sound interesting on paper, it fails miserably as a movie.  Things move at an unbearably slow pace despite the brief running time, nothing happens and there isn't a single character that you care enough about to pull you into the story.  So what we're left with is a film that will be disected and poured over for deeper meaning.

1264708,A1Q6PG0Y3XZL7M,B002E2M5IC,"Book & Music thief, from HI","[1, 1]","This is a seriously contemplative/ inquisitive/ and even somewhat 'maddening' film - actually very difficult to get a secure handle on....... because like its main protagonist Larry Gopnick (Jewish Physics professor, an under-achiever teaching at a 'hum-drum' mid-Western college) ==> each time a much desired 'answer' to one of his myriad Life-problems seems just on the verge of being revealed = a much larger (i.e. worse) situation (or two, or three) begins to assert itself.  Larry Gopnick just can't 'win' in Life, in fact it even seems like God might just have it in for him (is it because he has done something, or someone wrong?  If only he could figure it out - or does this constitute the ultimate 'uncertainty' principle?!)I have watched this intriguing Coen Brothers film more than once, and realized (like many viewers) that the only certainty about this movie is that it absolutely does not provide any satisfying answers, or even attempt to tie any loose ends - it seems to present an endless series of worse case scenarios (that, even worse yet, seem infinitely open-ended).Of course this sets-up a hilarious series of 'consultations' between Larry Gopnick and a number of Learned Rabbis (and even a few Legal professionals) ==> each 'enlightening' Larry to the fact that he is actually in much worse shape than he ever imagined, and painfully and meticulously emphasizing that God's ways & long-term plans are indeed 'mysterious' and possess a level of uncertainty much beyond Larry's comprehension (or even Schrodinger's beloved Cat's abstract mathematical models).However, Larry has a stratospherically Brilliant Brother (or is he just Crazy?) by the name of Arthur = he has mathematically plotted the perfect Formula underpinning the 'gears & levers' for the entire Universe in his personal life-long work = he calls the ""Mentaculus""  Not sure if his ingenious Work is greater than Einstein's Grand Unified Theory ==> but it certainly helps Arthur win tons of money at illegal card-poker games!  (constituting another major headache for beleaguered brother Larry, when the police show-up at his door.)Anyway, I think you get the point that this Coen Bros. film is certainly eccentric and most definitely not for all audiences (really for ones that (1) don't mind a philosophical 'challenge' and (2) can deal with 'incompleteness' = so you get both G&ouml;del + Schrodinger + brainy Cat + Mentaculus = what a bargain, or maybe more than You bargained for!

I didn't even know this was a Coen Bros film until after the credits started rolling. Then it all began to make sense. Before that, I was sometimes confused by the point here: The prologue set in 19th century Poland implies that we are somehow going to be watching a modern-day horror film in which we must watch to see who will be exposed as a type of devil or vampire. When the circa 1967 part of the film begins, it seems to be some type of deeply weird Jewish comedy. Only after awhile, does the viewer settle down and soak up the comic details. The look of suburban Minneapolis at the dawn of the hippy era as flower power just begins to creep into the Midwest is exactly perfect, it seems to me.

Having been raised Jewish myself the film instantly let me relate in a very personal way. I no longer practice but all those prayers and songs stay with you forever. All I need to do is hear some of that stuff and I can almost start chanting in all on my own.Right away the film reminded me of Albert Camus The Stranger. Coen brothers already tackled The Stranger head on with The Man Who Was Not There. Many of their other films deal with fate, free will, personal choice, destiny, and morality. Fargo, The Big Lebowski, No Country For Old  Men are a few that come to mind that deal with these topics. Are we in controll? How does morality factor in, and if we have control can we push or pull against fate or destiny?In ASM Larry is much like Meursault from The Stranger. He is carried along by fate, others, and resists only a little here and there. In The Stranger Meursault never resists his fate and is killed at the end. Every time Larry pushes even a bit there are consequences. As others have eloquently pointed out, acceptance of fate is the core of the film and attempting to be incongruous to it will lead only to problems.  Even the problems encountered by Larry all along are nothing compared to what results when he goes against his own morals at the end.The film is slow and plodding. It was a dense film that will surly produce more gems upon further watching.

The Coen Brothers could use this film as a dissertation proving that statement.  They say this is not about their father yet their father was a Professor at the University of Minnesota and that is where Larry Gopnik, the main character, is a professor.Larry Gopnik is a man who tries to do everything right, fitting in with the Jewish culture that has always been part and parcel of his life.  However, no matter how correct Larry is, in this movie the Gods turn their backs on him.  It is one disaster after another.  Hands down, the absolute best disaster is the episode involving his wife wanting a divorce and the guy she wants to remarry tries to ""befriend"" Larry. This guy, widower Sy Ableman, is absolutely hilarious and never more so than when we see how his plans turn out for him. The movie is one set piece after another of the trials and tribulations of Larry Gopnik in 1967 Minneapolis where he is working and raising his family.What this reminded me of most strongly was early Woody Allen movies.  Larry is that beset and the situations are that hilarious.  In fact, I didn't realize how much I missed those movies until I saw the Coens' do their version.I notice some here on Amazon rated this movie very low.  The only thing I can imagine is that they went into this thinking that it was going to be a typical Coen Brothers movie.  The odd thing is that it is a typical Coen Brothers movie IF you can manage to put aside the fact that it is entirely set within the Jewish American subculture, in Minneapolis 1967 no less.  I was raised Catholic, not Jewish, but frankly I find their predicaments pretty universal nonetheless.

Neither trait is humanly credible.  Consequently, the movie is too divorced from reality to have much meaning, even as a comedy.  And since spinelessness is hardly admirable, one cannot say that Larry is an attractive or sympathetic figure.The movie is also plagued by elements that remain--how to put it?--unassimilated.  Take its curious prologue, which is a parable about moral ambiguity.  Someone who appears to be a revered elder and a good samaritan may actually be a demon in disguise--or maybe not; it's hard to tell.  But the film itself is about a latter-day Job who suffers the insults, afflictions and outrages of the world:  an unambiguously good man to whom unambiguously bad things happen.  In short, the prologue has nothing to do with the movie.  It's merely the Coen brothers indulging themselves to no purpose, and not for the first time.The same is true of Rabbi Marshak quoting Grace Slick.  Yes, it's a send-up of a false sage.

Symbolism is tricky because you always run the risk of overdoing it; even wonderful films like ""Milk,"" ""Gran Torino,"" and ""W."" occasionally fell victim to obvious imagery. With ""A Serious Man,"" most of the symbolism is reserved for cleverly worded anecdotes, which paradoxically explain nothing. Larry is a faithful man, yet the rabbis he visits can't seem to give him decent spiritual advice. Then again, is it possible to find the answers on the outside when the problems are within?Stuhlbarg is perfectly cast, playing Larry not as the raving comical figure one might expect from a man in his situation. Rather, he plays him as a quietly desperate man, someone who sees everything around him yet can't process how it has all gone wrong. The more he tries to understand the meaning of his life, the less he ultimately discovers. Why, for example, has his wife, Judith (Sari Wagner Lennick), never given any indication that their marriage was in trouble? Why does she want to be with Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), a man so phony and obnoxious that he should be hated on general principles? Why did Larry have to move into a motel when it would have been much easier for Judith to move in with Sy? Maybe the answers lie with the elusive Rabbi Marshak (Alan Mandell), who Larry has been having trouble making an appointment to see.What this movie so brilliantly conveys is that paralyzing sense of being on your own in an unsympathetic world. This applies to the look as well as to the people; the Coen Brothers, who grew up in St. Louis Park, Minnesota during the 1960s, have faithfully recreated that time and place, pitting their protagonist against a frighteningly routine mid-twentieth century landscape of identical rambler homes and neatly manicured lawns. But the fact that Larry is having a hard time doesn't necessarily mean we nothing but sympathy for him; he thinks he can solve all his problems simply by visiting rabbis, when in fact they can only provide him with metaphorical observations and long-winded fables that don't really go anywhere. He seeks an insightful message when in fact there isn't one to give, save maybe for the lyrics of a Jefferson Airplane song.Aside from Larry, the film's most engaging character is his brother, Arthur (Richard Kind), a man whose notebook of rambling mathematical formulas blurs the line between genius and insanity. He physically represents his social awkwardness: Overweight, tall, and perpetually hunched over, with a cyst on the back of his neck that he continuously drains with a special suction machine. He seems like a decent person at heart, although that doesn't mean he isn't capable of doing something wrong. There comes a point when he runs off half naked, crying like a five-year-old while ranting about how unfair God has been to him. He looks at Larry and sees not a miserable soul whose life is falling apart, but as someone who lucked out by getting married and having children. Is he right? I guess that depends on how you define being lucky.Some audiences will not appreciate the ending, which symbolically makes it clear that virtually nothing has been resolved. We do, however, get a wonderful visual representation of a turning point, something the Coen Brothers are known for including in their films. It's an image that emphasizes more than life's unpredictability; it also emphasizes a new chapter in Larry's life, one we aren't meant to see but know will be just as challenging. One can only hope that he eventually finds the answers he has been looking for. ""A Serious Man"" is one of the year's best films--darkly funny and deeply introspective, deliberately paced and cleverly structured, strong in character, dialogue, and imagery. Some of its greatest images are of quirky subtleties, like carefully angled shots of Larry's facial expressions. If you were in his situation, your face would look the same way.",5,"When the Truth is Found to Be Lies, and All the Joy Within You Dies",1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,5142,"['college', 'physics',

If there was a plot, it may (?) have had something to do with the meaning of life being buried in a Jefferson Airplane song, but it was impossible to tell. I tend to think that its whole purpose was little more than an indulgent piece of throwaway art. Though the acting was good, the talents of those involved were wasted on slow, boring dialogue that tries to generate sympathy for the tortured hero at the center of the film. Sadly, it never quite got there for me or those with whom I watched it.  It ended with us scratching our heads and wondering how it got made.

1264721,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B002E2M5IC,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[3, 3]","Writers and directors, brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, have often made their mark in cinema (Blood Simple, Fargo) with their take on the human condition shot on an independent film budget.  In A Serious Man they get self reflective on their own childhoods growing up in a Jewish family of the 1960's.  The result is their most personal, incisive film to date, and one that is told with sharp observation and honesty.An opening scene tells the tale of a peasant couple visited by an elderly man who turns out to be a ghost.  Are they cursed or blessed by this ominous apparition?In a 1960's Minnesota suburb, Larry Gopnik is a timid college professor with a wife, son, and daughter.  His son is smoking pot, and his daughter steals his money for a nose job.  One day his wife announces that she and his best friend Sy have become close and that she wants a divorce.  Further, Sy wants to have a long talk with Larry to counsel and help him through his tough time.  This happens at the same time Larry is up for tenure at his college, and a Korean student tries to bribe him for a passing grade.  As if this weren't enough, his brother, Arthur, who has all sorts of physical ailments and personal problems, is staying at his house.  Meanwhile, Larry spies on and is tortured by his female neighbor who likes to sunbathe in the nude.Things go from bad to frustratingly worse as Larry goes to see three rabbis for advice only to get inconclusive or non-answers.  His bills with the attorneys are mounting, and he is told to move out of his own house.  Now the Korean student's dad threatens to sue him, and he is plagued by nightmares.  The events don't turn out as expected and the twists and turns culminate with his son completing his bar mitzvah.  An ominous new set of events threatens to uproot his world even as Larry seeks to make sense and order of his plight and tries to do the right things and be a `serious man'.The storyline will ring true for most audiences, especially baby boomers.  Larry is a brilliant study in angst and suffering.  By the film's ending, the question remains: what is important in one's life?  What matters most?  No commentary is made or judgment passed about Larry and his family, and the Coens offer no answers.  What we get is a case study of one family trying to survive fractious events.  Although told from their Jewish background and experiences, the Coens are able to strike the right emotional connection by showing Larry's response to a difficult set of circumstances.  His feelings and reactions are universal, and perhaps that is the point of the movie: The problems of the common man are eternal and life is a stream of situations that can be daunting and are constantly supplanted by new adversity.  Much as Ordinary People revealed discord and a disconnect in a middle class family, A Serious Man shows this family slowly disintegrating.  Larry's situation bears striking similarities to the lead in Into the Night.A mostly unknown cast actually helps the film by not having the distraction of well known faces.  They are people like you and me.  Michael Stuhlbarg is quite convincing as Larry, and folks might recognize Arthur portrayed by TV character actor Richard Kind.It's not the Coens' best work but it is their most intimate one which they could afford to do after winning Best Picture with No Country for Old Men only a couple years before.

It's meticulously set in 1967, for reasons made (somewhat) clear in the film.Gopnik suffers a series of humiliations. His wife betrays him. Her lover mocks him. His lazy leech of a brother burdens him. A failing student tries to bribe him, and rudely confronts him when he rejects the bribe. His teenage children barely notice  when he gets kicked out of his house and moves to a cheap motel. Three rabbis do not offer him the solace that he desperately seeks. In fact, one of the rabbis confuses him by telling an absurd story that eats up a big chunk of the film. And the above list probably only covers about half of Gopnik's woes.I don't blame the actors. They did their best with a very weak story, and some of the performances, including Stuhlbarg's, were impressive. Hence the two stars.I have seen and thoroughly enjoyed five other Coen brothers films, so I know how talented they are. But they just do not deliver with this one.Perhaps their goal here is to show us that life is unfair and that bad things happen to good, honest, and, yes, ""serious"" people. Bad things also happen to people like Gopnik, who, if you think about it, isn't really all that ""good."" The big problem is we knew all of this before we hit the play button.

1264723,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B002E2M5IC,DanD,"[4, 5]","With A SERIOUS MAN, the Coen Brothers have crafted a movie that doesn't fully fit with the rest of their work.  Usually, their films can be divided in one of two categories: tragic dramas where most people end up dying; and so-dark-you-need-to-flip-on-the-lights comedy.  A SERIOUS MAN is neither.  It is dark; it is not a feel-good movie, and you walk away from it with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach.  But it isn't wholly serious, either; it's comedy is wry and understated, even by Coen standards.  Nor is there really much of a plot: Larry Gopnik is a middle-aged college professor whose life is slowly spinning out of control.  His cyst-suffering brother Arthur is under investigation for various escalating crimes; his son, a stoner, is getting ready for his bar mitzvah; his position is up for tenure, just as a Korean student is trying to bribe him, and someone is writing nasty letters to the tenure committee; his wife is leaving him for a man who is rather less-than-ideal; and to add to his troubles, Larry is going through a rather strong crisis of faith, which even a string of rabbis can't help with.This is a slow film, heavy on symbolism: it begins with a Yiddish folktale, and ends...well, symbolically.  In between, you will find some above-par performances primarily from a cast of unknowns, led by Michael Stuhlbarg as Larry.  The direction is as solid as ever; the cinematography (from Roger Deakin, frequent Coen collaborator) is beautiful; and the brothers' script well-deserves its Oscar nod.  There's not much here not to love; just remember, as Jessica McManus (who plays Larry's daughter) says in the making of feature: ""Every day that goes by they depress me more.""  This is not a movie for the weak-willed, and is sure to alienate some viewers.  But then, that's the Coen Brothers for you.

I didn't see either ""Serious Man"" - I didn't see the Village Voice's anti-Semitic film, and I also didn't see the masterpiece Coen Brothers groupies insist, against all evidence, that this film is.""A Serious Man"" has style to burn, and little substance. The Coen Brothers' production team worked very hard to recreate the look of a Midwestern suburb in 1967, and their success is breathtakingly evident. During opening scenes, I wasn't caring about the paper-thin characters or the plot that could be summed up in one boring sentence fragment - bad things happen to a man the film's directors don't care about - rather I was obsessed with the fly-in-amber 1967-era suburb the Coens were able to recreate in what is obviously a low-budget film. The pristine, uniform, lawns, the blindingly white, crackless sidewalks, the vintage cars, the skyline absent of the crowns of mature trees, the spotless just-moved-in look of the homes, really do strike you. Sadly, the surface of this film is much more impressive than anything else going on onscreen.Michael Stuhlbarg, a stage actor I've never seen in anything else, is poignant as Larry Gopnik, a married, suburban dad and physics professor experiencing a run of bad luck. In spite of the Coens' signature coldness and sadism, I actually cared about Larry. I fervently wished that he, and Stuhlbarg, were in a much better movie. The Coens' complete absence of investment in Larry leaves you, the viewer, free to laugh at the sadistic traps they set for him. I did laugh when Larry's torpedo-shaped wife brusquely demands a divorce, and when her lover forces a hug on Larry and presents him with a bottle of wine. Secondary characters were also amusing, often stereotypically so. There's the icebox frigid Korean student, with the incongruous name of Clive, and the comical rabbis. Rabbi Scott is eager as a bunny but too young and unsure; Rabbi Nachtner is older, arrogant, and all too sure of himself. The jokes are funny and, edited down, this could have been a rewarding thirty minute film. It's padded out, though, and the film goes well past the point where the Coens ran out of ideas. Fans struggle to apply meaning to the film's opening, a pointless excursion to a sort of low-budget, high school production of a shtetl tale the Coens invented themselves. The movie itself goes off the rails and starts dramatizing Larry's dreams, none of which has any point that hasn't already been made.I think the real headscratching, slightly funny, slightly heartbreaking, slightly Ashkenazi fable around ""A Serious Man"" is not so much the film itself; the film itself is rather flimsy and shallow. Rather, what's noteworthy about this film is fan reaction to it. Read fan reviews: you must understand Schrodinger's Cat in order to understand this film! You must understand the Talmud to understand this film! You must understand a recently discovered, highly cryptic, 1905 email that Albert Einstein sent to Sholem Aleichem in order to understand this film! You get the idea. Hardcore Coen fans insist on seeing depth in what is a very shallow, half-baked movie. I suspect that these fans experience a movie the way some might experience doing a jigsaw puzzle while stoned and while working their way through the required reading list of an elite college for precocious, but troubled, boys.Finally, the Book of Job, allegedly the inspiration for ""A Serious Man,"" is actually a magnificent work of literature.

1264725,A2NVQM5H3RS1SL,B002E2M5IC,Darren X,"[11, 28]","I'm utterly baffled by the glowing reviews of this film, from seemingly intelligent people.  Can we have been watching the same film?  The film I saw was the cinematic equivalent of a root canal.  15 minutes in I was feeling unengaged, after half an hour I was wondering in frustration: ""where is this GOING?"", and after 45 minutes (feeling rather cheated by all the positive reviews) I decided I'd rather write a review of it than finish watching it.  I see from the many other extremely negative reviews that my opinion wouldn't have changed.Allow me to summarize the plot:  after a ten minute episode about a dybbuk set in a Jewish village in Poland (which was rather creepy and interesting but had NOTHING to do with the rest of the film), the remaining 90 minutes of the film are taken up with Larry, who lives in a banal Jewish suburb in Minneapolis (?) in the 60s, and  is beset by troubles from the people around him.  In response, Larry does..... nothing, and learns nothing.  There's a Sopranos-style ending, and that's it.Upon further reflection, I've decided that you'd need to be Jewish (or at least, of a religious/mystical mindset), in order to have the deep thoughts that people are apparently having about symbolism, the meaning of life, Judaism, God, etc when they watch this film.  If that's the sort of thing that turns your crank then apparently you'll like this.For me this was the wrong movie. As an atheist, these themes are completely uninteresting to me, and there's not much else going on here.  The movie is not 1/100th as funny as Lebowski, it's painfully, PAINfully slow, full of very ugly (in all senses of the word) and uninteresting people.  This film is reminiscent of Days of Darkness by Denys Arcand (shlumpy everyman is beset by troubles, not much happens), but in that film, the everyman at least displays human reactions, fights back, learns something about himself, and finds a bit of peace.  In short, it has a ""story"", and thus it's a far, far, FAR more watchable film than this mess.Acting, sets, cinematography are all very good (the actors all convincingly portray repellent and unwatchable people).  With all this talent, it's too bad they didn't make a movie.  I read the New Yorker review of this film which I thought was very good: ""As a piece of moviemaking craft, A Serious Man is fascinating; in every other way, it's intolerable.""",1,"Agonizingly dull, I shut it off after 45 minutes",1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,2383,"[""'m"", 'utterly', 'baffled', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'film', 'seemingly', 'intelligent', 'people', 'Can', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'same', 'film', 'film', 'saw', 'was', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'root', 'canal', '15', 'minutes', 'was', 'feeling', 'unengaged', 'hour', 'was', 'wondering', 'frustration', 'where', 'GOING', '45', 'minutes', 'feeling', 'rather', 'cheated', 'positive', 'reviews', 'decided', ""'d"", 'rather', 'write', 'review', 'finish', 'watching', 'see', 'many', 'other', 'extremely', 'negative', 'reviews', 'opinion', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'changed.Allow', 'summarize', 'plot', 'ten', 'minute', 'episode', 'dybbuk', 'set', 'Jewish', 'village', 'Poland', 'was', 'rather', 'creepy', 'interesting', 'had', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'rest', 'film', 'remaining', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'taken', 'up', 'Larry', 'who', 'banal', 'Jewish', 'suburb', 'Minneapolis', '60s', 'beset', 'troubles', 'people', 'response', 'Larry', '..', 'nothing', 'nothing', 'Sopranos-style', 'ending', 'it.Upon', 'further', 'reflection', ""'ve"", 'decided', ""'d"", 'need', 'be', 'Jewish', 'least', 'religious/mystical', 'mindset', 'order', 'have', 'deep', 'thoughts', 'people', 'are', 'apparently', 'having', 'symbolism', 'meaning', 'life', 'Judaism', 'God', 'etc', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'sort', 'thing', 'crank', 'then', 'apparently', ""'ll"", 'like', 'this.For', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'atheist', 'themes', 'are', 'completely', 'uninteresting', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'going', 'here', 'movie', 'not', '1/100th', 'as', 'funny', 'Lebowski', 'painfully', 'PAINfully', 'slow', 'full', 'very', 'ugly', 'senses', 'word', 'uninteresting', 'people', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'Days', 'Darkness', 'Denys', 'Arcand', 'shlumpy', 'everyman', 'beset', 'troubles', 'not', 'much', 'happens', 'film', 'everyman', 'least', 'displays', 'human', 'reactions', 'fights', 'back', 'something', 'bit', 'peace', 'short', 'story', 'thus', 'far', 'far', 'FAR', 'more', 'watchable', 'film', 'mess.Acting', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'convincingly', 'portray', 'repellent', 'unwatchable', 'people', 'talent', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'read', 'New', 'Yorker', 'review', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'piece', 'moviemaking', 'craft', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'fascinating', 'other', 'way', 'intolerable']",A Serious Man
1264726,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B002E2M5IC,Davewise,"[0, 1]","The Coen brothers have written and directed another great darkly humorous movie with ""A Serious Man"". It's a movie that will do more than make you laugh though - it'll make you think. Think about how all those daily problems can add up. Think about how bad things happen to good people. Think about how things can almost always be worse. Think about what life might really be about.With Adam Arkin and Richard Kind being perhaps the most recognizable names, the largely unknown cast still shines. While the Coens can work with anyone they want, this shows that for them it's all about the movie-making and picking the right cast regardless of star-power. Michael Stuhlbarg in particular is excellent as Larry Gopnik, the main character who begins to ask himself what life is all about. Larry suddenly finds his life falling apart around him, from big things to the very small. His wife decides she wants a divorce; however, this doesn't seem to bother their two kids - their son just wants the antenna fixed so he can watch ""F-Troop"". Larry has to help his older brother - who's already living with the family and unable or unwilling to find an apartment - out of trouble with the police. A student in Larry's physics class tries to bribe him for a passing grade while the school board is considering him for tenure. It all gets to be too much for him, so he tries to consult three different rabbis, getting three very different responses.While the movie has a strong Jewish element to it, you don't need to be Jewish to appreciate it (I'm not). If you're afraid you'll get lost in the handful of Yiddish expressions used, they even have an extra on the disc a few minutes long which provides definitions. People from any background can identify with the feeling of being overwhelmed though. Everyone at one time or another asks themselves if there's really any meaning behind life and all the suffering that goes on. Often the answers we're given by people we think will know more seem hollow and unhelpful. Many of the situations in the movie may seem outrageous, but that doesn't affect how relatable Larry's plight is. His character is very ordinary which makes him easy to sympathize with.If you're a fan of dark comedy or philosophical comedy or of the Coen brothers (perhaps there's more than a little overlap there), I highly recommend this movie. In some ways it may be rather simple, yet it remains very original.

They're always reinventing themselves and even if I don't care much for the result I'm always eager for their next offering.  ""A Serious Man"" isn't one of their better films.  Yes there are some inspired moments here but on the whole this is a case of style over substance.  I was intrigued by the idea of them exploring the Midwestern American Jewish experience, which may have an element of autobiography for the Coens, but this exercise left me cold.

1264728,AL2ZCI11JEROS,B002E2M5IC,David,"[76, 92]","Yes, it's not for everyone. A strong grasp of both Jewish tradition and quantum physics would do the potential viewer well in getting the absolute most out of the film. But, as someone who is by no means an expert in either area, this one hit me on quite a base level in its unflinching and very true-to-life depiction of a man's life coming apart at the seams and all the existential angst that ensues. The wonderful thing is, A Serious Man is not only deeply resonant and moving, but quite hilarious as well- in that dark, dark way that may be just a little too dark for some.The Coens have always caught some flack for their supposed misanthropic elitism; or, in other words, what has been seen by some critics as a sort of contemptuous mocking of the characters they depict onscreen, the two directors never fully granting their filmic creations emotional sympathy. If it was previously easy to debunk this claim, it is now, with A Serious Man, a piece of cake. Has there been a performance in recent years more gut-wrenchingly honest and genuinely pathos-exuding than Michael Stuhlbarg here as protagonist Larry Gopnik? That the narrative thrust of the film is essentially centered around all the horrifying and humiliating events that befall Gopnik does not necessarily mean that the Coens thumb their noses down at this character. If we take into consideration the personal nature of the film (set in a time and place very much like when/where they grew up, and populated by characters probably not unlike those they knew), then it comes as no surprise that A Serious Man is the most studied and 'serious' Coen brothers film to date.Simply in terms of sheer film-making craft, this is the Coens, and certainly cinematographer Roger Deakins, at the peak of their respective crafts. The recreation of a late 60's heavily Jewish Midwestern locale is pitch-perfect (minus a few very small anachronisms). Not a scene feels wasted, not a shot superfluous; the picture is beautifully symmetric in structure and full of little rhymes and rhythms and repetitions, plenty striking and quasi-iconic images (Stuhlbarg on the roof as pictured on the DVD and promotional poster being one of many), and lots of likely soon-to-be classic dialogue infused with both the Coens' trademark deadpan humor (a la The Big Lebowski) as well as the film's broader thematic concerns.Then there's the ending, or perhaps as some would say, lack thereof. Not unlike the ambiguous note that No Country For Old Men went out on, the final moments of A Serious Man will probably leave many angered, many confused, and many disappointed. But I don't think there was any other way to close such a film, one largely concerned, as it is, with all the great uncertainties that plague life-- what more appropriate way to end it than with the greatest cinematic uncertainty of all? The final shot is, I think, one of the most haunting in cinema history. I've seen the film three times in the theater, each time leaving awestruck and emotionally drained as the various events of the film, its haunting score and its devastating philosophical implications swirl around my head.A Serious Man, then, is truly a serious film, with the (black) humor only arising naturally from the utter tragic unfair-ness of life as seen through the protagonist's eyes, and not forced on the situations irreverently as in a lot of films. Given the uncompromisingly bleak nature of the film, perhaps it's best summed up by an old and rather clich&eacute; platitude (not unlike the one the film somewhat ironically opens with): When you feel like crying, laugh instead.",5,Absolute masterpiece,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,3612,"['Yes', 'not', 'everyone', 'strong', 'grasp', 'Jewish', 'tradition', 'quantum', 'physics', 'would', 'do', 'potential', 'viewer', 'well', 'getting', 'absolute', 'most', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'means', 'expert', 'area', 'one', 'hit', 'base', 'level', 'unflinching', 'very', 'true-to-life', 'depiction', 'man', 'life', 'coming', 'apart', 'seams', 'existential', 'angst', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'not', 'only', 'deeply', 'resonant', 'moving', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'well-', 'dark', 'dark', 'way', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'dark', 'some.The', 'Coens', 'have', 'always', 'caught', 'flack', 'supposed', 'misanthropic', 'elitism', 'other', 'words', 'what', 'been', 'seen', 'critics', 'sort', 'contemptuous', 'mocking', 'characters', 'depict', 'onscreen', 'two', 'directors', 'never', 'fully', 'granting', 'filmic', 'creations', 'emotional', 'sympathy', 'was', 'previously', 'easy', 'debunk', 'claim', 'now', 'Serious', 'Man', 'piece', 'cake', 'Has', 'there', 'been', 'performance', 'recent', 'years', 'more', 'gut-wrenchingly', 'honest', 'genuinely', 'pathos-exuding', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'here', 'protagonist', 'Larry', 'Gopnik', 'narrative', 'thrust', 'film', 'essentially', 'centered', 'horrifying', 'humiliating', 'events', 'befall', 'Gopnik', 'not', 'necessarily', 'mean', 'Coens', 'thumb', 'noses', 'down', 'character', 'take', 'consideration', 'personal', 'nature', 'film', 'set', 'time', 'place', 'very', 'much', 'when/where', 'grew', 'up', 'populated', 'characters', 'probably', 'not', 'knew', 'then', 'surprise', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'most', 'studied', ""'serious"", 'Coen', 'brothers', 'film', 'date.Simply', 'terms', 'sheer', 'film-making', 'craft', 'Coens', 'certainly', 'cinematographer', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'peak', 'respective', 'crafts', 'recreation', 'late', '60', 'heavily', 'Jewish', 'Midwestern', 'locale', 'pitch-perfect', 'few', 'very', 'small', 'anachronisms', 'Not', 'scene', 'feels', 'wasted', 'not', 'shot', 'superfluous', 'picture', 'beautifully', 'symmetric', 'structure', 'full', 'little', 'rhymes', 'rhythms', 'repetitions', 'plenty', 'striking', 'quasi-iconic', 'images', 'Stuhlbarg', 'roof', 'pictured', 'DVD', 'promotional', 'poster', 'being', 'one', 'many', 'lots', 'likely', 'soon-to-be', 'classic', 'dialogue', 'infused', 'Coens', 'trademark', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'la', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'broader', 'thematic', 'concerns.Then', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'would', 'say', 'lack', 'thereof', 'Not', 'ambiguous', 'note', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'went', 'out', 'final', 'moments', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'many', 'angered', 'many', 'confused', 'many', 'disappointed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'other', 'way', 'close', 'such', 'film', 'one', 'largely', 'concerned', 'great', 'uncertainties', 'plague', 'life', 'what', 'more', 'appropriate', 'way', 'end', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'uncertainty', 'final', 'shot', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'haunting', 'cinema', 'history', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'three', 'times', 'theater', 'time', 'leaving', 'awestruck', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'various', 'events', 'film', 'haunting', 'score', 'devastating', 'philosophical', 'implications', 'swirl', 'head.A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'then', 'truly', 'serious', 'film', 'black', 'humor', 'only', 'arising', 'naturally', 'utter', 'tragic', 'unfair-ness', 'life', 'seen', 'protagonist', 'eyes', 'not', 'forced', 'situations', 'irreverently', 'lot', 'films', 'Given', 'uncompromisingly', 'bleak', 'nature', 'film', 'perhaps', 'best', 'summed', 'up', 'old', 'rather', 'clich', 'eacute', 'platitude', 'not', 'one', 'film', 'somewhat', 'ironically', 'When', 'feel', 'crying', 'instead']",A Serious Man

Michael Stuhlbarg is fantastic in a career-defining performance. And the fun the Coen's poke at Judaism, parenthood, and life in general is witty and beautifully rendered.

1264734,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B002E2M5IC,D. Hartley,"[2, 3]","""A Serious Man"" is the closest that the Coen Brothers have come to writing something semi-autobiographical; they grew up in a largely Jewish suburban Minneapolis neighborhood (St. Louis Park) and they set their story in a Minnesotan Jewish suburban enclave, in the summer of 1967 (when Joel was 13 and Ethan was 10). God help them, however, if their family was anything like the Gopniks (although if they were, it would explain a lot about the world view they expound in their films). Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a ""serious man""- a buttoned-down physics professor who can map out the paradoxical quantum mysteries of Schrodinger's cat on a blackboard, but is absolutely stymied as to why his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) suddenly announces to him one day out of the blue that she wants a divorce. To add insult to injury, she wants him to move out of the house as soon as possible, so that the man she wishes to spend the rest of her life with, a smarmy neighborhood widower named Sy Abelman (Fred Melamed) can settle in.This situation alone would give any self-respecting mensch such tsuris, nu? Yes, it gets worse. Larry gets no sympathy or support from his snotty, self-absorbed daughter (Jessica McManus) or his stoner son (Aaron Wolff), who spends more time obsessing on his favorite TV show ""F Troop"" than brushing up on his Hebrew for an upcoming Bar Mitzvah. He also has problems at work, ranging from the usual politics of academia to staving off a deranged student who is attempting to blackmail his way to a passing grade. And then there is his perennially underemployed brother (Richard Kind) who has become a permanent house guest who spends an inordinate amount of time in the bathroom, draining his, erm, cyst (ah, yes-we're still firmly entrenched in Coen territory here, kids).Teetering on the verge of an existential meltdown, Larry seeks advice from three rabbis, embarking on a spiritual quest in order to glean, well, ""Why me?"" The story takes on the airs of a modern fable from this point onward, neatly telegraphed by the film's opening ten minutes-a blackly comic, old school Yiddish folk tale with semi-mystical overtones strongly reminiscent of Woody Allen's ""Love and Death"". In the context of the Coen's oeuvre, the character of Larry Gopnick is not really so far removed from William Macy's character in ""Fargo"" or Billy Bob Thornton's character in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" (sans the murder and mayhem, but sharing the plight of the hapless Everyman, ultimately left twisting in the wind by the detached cruelty of Fate...and the Coens themselves).This is one of those films that I think I need to see again, because it really has some interesting layers to it that I don't think can be fully appreciated in just one viewing (especially for its provocatively enigmatic ending) It's smart, it's funny, it's made (gasp!) for adults, and it's one of the most wildly original films I've seen in a while. The cast is excellent, especially Sthulbarg and Kind, who are very believable as brothers with a complex relationship, and have some genuinely poignant scenes together (does their relationship reflect Joel and Ethan's, I wonder?). I have to mention a wonderful (if brief) performance by Amy Landecker as the sexy neighbor, Mrs. Samsky (channeling Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson), who has a hilarious seduction scene with the uptight Larry.When the film was in its initial run, there were some mutterings about the film being ""too"" Jewish, propagating stereotypes and so on and so forth, the Coens are self-loathing, blah blah blah, but I think that's silly. Hey-I've got relatives that are more ""Jewish"" than the characters in the film. Besides, the Coens are Jews-is there some law against artists incorporating their heritage into their art? One might as well condemn Phillip Roth, Saul Bellow, Jules Feiffer, Mel Brooks, Woody Allen and Neil Simon for the same ""crime"".",4,The accidental tsuris,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,3908,"['Serious', 'Man', 'closest', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'have', 'come', 'writing', 'something', 'semi-autobiographical', 'grew', 'up', 'largely', 'Jewish', 'suburban', 'Minneapolis', 'neighborhood', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Park', 'set', 'story', 'Minnesotan', 'Jewish', 'suburban', 'enclave', 'summer', '1967', 'when', 'Joel', 'was', '13', 'Ethan', 'was', '10', 'God', 'however', 'family', 'was', 'anything', 'Gopniks', 'were', 'would', 'explain', 'lot', 'world', 'view', 'expound', 'films', 'Larry', 'Gopnik', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'serious', 'man', 'buttoned-down', 'physics', 'professor', 'who', 'can', 'map', 'out', 'paradoxical', 'quantum', 'mysteries', 'Schrodinger', 'cat', 'blackboard', 'absolutely', 'stymied', 'why', 'wife', 'Judith', 'Sari', 'Lennick', 'suddenly', 'one', 'day', 'blue', 'divorce', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'move', 'house', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'man', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'smarmy', 'neighborhood', 'widower', 'named', 'Sy', 'Abelman', 'Fred', 'Melamed', 'can', 'settle', 'in.This', 'situation', 'alone', 'would', 'give', 'self-respecting', 'mensch', 'such', 'tsuris', 'nu', 'Yes', 'worse', 'Larry', 'sympathy', 'support', 'snotty', 'self-absorbed', 'daughter', 'Jessica', 'McManus', 'stoner', 'son', 'Aaron', 'Wolff', 'who', 'more', 'time', 'obsessing', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'F', 'Troop', 'brushing', 'up', 'Hebrew', 'upcoming', 'Bar', 'Mitzvah', 'also', 'problems', 'work', 'ranging', 'usual', 'politics', 'academia', 'staving', 'off', 'deranged', 'student', 'who', 'attempting', 'blackmail', 'way', 'passing', 'grade', 'then', 'perennially', 'underemployed', 'brother', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'who', 'become', 'permanent', 'house', 'guest', 'who', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'bathroom', 'draining', 'erm', 'cyst', 'ah', 'yes-we', ""'re"", 'still', 'firmly', 'entrenched', 'Coen', 'territory', 'here', 'kids', '.Teetering', 'verge', 'existential', 'meltdown', 'Larry', 'advice', 'three', 'rabbis', 'embarking', 'spiritual', 'quest', 'order', 'glean', 'well', 'Why', 'story', 'airs', 'modern', 'fable', 'point', 'onward', 'neatly', 'telegraphed', 'film', 'opening', 'ten', 'minutes-a', 'blackly', 'comic', 'old', 'school', 'Yiddish', 'folk', 'tale', 'semi-mystical', 'overtones', 'strongly', 'reminiscent', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Love', 'Death', 'context', 'Coen', 'oeuvre', 'character', 'Larry', 'Gopnick', 'not', 'really', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'William', 'Macy', 'character', 'Fargo', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'character', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'murder', 'mayhem', 'sharing', 'plight', 'hapless', 'Everyman', 'ultimately', 'left', 'twisting', 'wind', 'detached', 'cruelty', 'Fate', 'Coens', '.This', 'one', 'films', 'think', 'need', 'see', 'again', 'really', 'interesting', 'layers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'just', 'one', 'viewing', 'especially', 'provocatively', 'enigmatic', 'ending', 'smart', 'funny', 'made', 'gasp', 'adults', 'one', 'most', 'wildly', 'original', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'cast', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Sthulbarg', 'Kind', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'brothers', 'complex', 'relationship', 'have', 'genuinely', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'together', 'relationship', 'reflect', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'wonder', 'have', 'mention', 'wonderful', 'brief', 'performance', 'Amy', 'Landecker', 'sexy', 'neighbor', 'Mrs.', 'Samsky', 'channeling', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'who', 'hilarious', 'seduction', 'scene', 'uptight', 'Larry.When', 'film', 'was', 'initial', 'run', 'were', 'mutterings', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'Jewish', 'propagating', 'stereotypes', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'Coens', 'are', 'self-loathing', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'think', 'silly', 'Hey-I', ""'ve"", 'got', 'relatives', 'are', 'more', 'Jewish', 'characters', 'film', 'Coens', 'are', 'Jews-is', 'law', 'artists', 'incorporating', 'heritage', 'art', 'One', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'condemn', 'Phillip', 'Roth', 'Saul', 'Bellow', 'Jules', 'Feiffer', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'same', 'crime']",A Serious Man

To them, religion and philosophy and mathematics offer no real assistance, and even art is no real consolation.When Larry Gopnik's life problems/stresses (unsatisifed wife whose met someone new, wife's new man who has the gall to offer him life advice, kids he doesn't understand, disgruntled S. Korean student sending letters to his dept chair undermining his shot at tenure, unstable brother whose own problems/stresses far outweigh his own) become too much for him to bear, he aks a young rabbi for advice, the rabbi just looks out the window at the parking lot and tells him what he needs is a new perspective, a perspective that will allow him to see the world differently but its completely up to Larry Gopnik to figure out how to adjust his perspective/his own perceptual antenna.When Larry Gopnik asks an older rabbi for advice, the rabbi just tells him a long story about the futility of looking for answers or meaning. His advice seems to be that all we can do is get used to not knowing why the world is the way it is or why things happen the way they do.All religion, (or art), has to offer are stories of other people's confusions that momentarily divert us from our own.Larry Gopnik is happiest. most at ease, when he climbs up on his roof, adjusts his perceptual antenna, and allows himself to be diverted from his own life (by his sexy neighbor who sunbathes in the nude and who seems to live in a perpetual state of distraction aided by pop culture and recreational drugs).That is all, the Coen Bros seem to be saying in this film that is a culmination and reflection upon their life's work thus far, that we can offer you.Last scene (spoiler alert): I think the phone call that comes right after Larry Gopnik changes Clive's grade to a C-(which I love) could be interpreted to mean that there is order in the universe after all, and that everyone gets whats coming to them, but if the phone call means cancer and if the tornado touching down is meant to be the hand of God come down to take Larry's son, well thats a pretty harsh set of punishments for giving Clive a C-.Given the choice between living in a random or indifferent universe without any ultimate order and living in a cruel universe that is ordered by a strict disciplinarian, I think most people would take the random or indifferent universe.",4,But I didn't do anything,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,2977,"['Kafkaesque', 'when', 'enter', 'surreal', 'world', 'control', 'patterns', 'plans', 'whole', 'way', 'have', 'configured', 'own', 'behavior', 'fall', 'pieces', 'when', 'find', 'force', 'not', 'lend', 'way', 'perceive', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'lie', 'down', 'die', 'What', 'do', 'struggle', 'equipment', 'have', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'Kafkaesque', 'Frederick', 'KarlThe', 'Coens', 'philosophical', 'universe', 'empty', 'one', 'meaningless', 'one', 'have', 'nuggets', 'wisdom', 'insights', 'offer', 'have', 'coping', 'strategy', 'religion', 'philosophy', 'mathematics', 'offer', 'real', 'assistance', 'even', 'art', 'real', 'consolation.When', 'Larry', 'Gopnik', 'life', 'problems/stresses', 'unsatisifed', 'wife', 'met', 'someone', 'new', 'wife', 'new', 'man', 'who', 'gall', 'offer', 'life', 'advice', 'kids', ""n't"", 'understand', 'disgruntled', 'S.', 'Korean', 'student', 'sending', 'letters', 'dept', 'chair', 'undermining', 'shot', 'tenure', 'unstable', 'brother', 'own', 'problems/stresses', 'far', 'outweigh', 'own', 'become', 'too', 'much', 'bear', 'young', 'rabbi', 'advice', 'rabbi', 'just', 'out', 'window', 'parking', 'lot', 'what', 'new', 'perspective', 'perspective', 'will', 'allow', 'see', 'world', 'differently', 'completely', 'Larry', 'Gopnik', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'adjust', 'perspective/his', 'own', 'perceptual', 'antenna.When', 'Larry', 'Gopnik', 'older', 'rabbi', 'advice', 'rabbi', 'just', 'long', 'story', 'futility', 'looking', 'answers', 'meaning', 'advice', 'be', 'can', 'do', 'get', 'used', 'not', 'knowing', 'why', 'world', 'way', 'why', 'things', 'happen', 'way', 'do.All', 'religion', 'art', 'offer', 'are', 'stories', 'other', 'people', 'confusions', 'momentarily', 'divert', 'own.Larry', 'Gopnik', 'happiest', 'most', 'ease', 'when', 'up', 'roof', 'perceptual', 'antenna', 'be', 'diverted', 'own', 'life', 'sexy', 'neighbor', 'who', 'nude', 'who', 'live', 'perpetual', 'state', 'distraction', 'aided', 'pop', 'culture', 'recreational', 'drugs', 'Coen', 'Bros', 'seem', 'be', 'saying', 'film', 'culmination', 'reflection', 'life', 'work', 'thus', 'far', 'can', 'offer', 'you.Last', 'scene', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'think', 'phone', 'call', 'right', 'Larry', 'Gopnik', 'Clive', 'grade', 'C-', 'love', 'could', 'be', 'interpreted', 'mean', 'order', 'universe', 'everyone', 'coming', 'phone', 'call', 'cancer', 'tornado', 'touching', 'down', 'meant', 'be', 'hand', 'God', 'come', 'down', 'take', 'Larry', 'son', 'well', 'pretty', 'harsh', 'set', 'punishments', 'giving', 'Clive', 'C-.Given', 'choice', 'living', 'random', 'indifferent', 'universe', 'ultimate', 'order', 'living', 'cruel', 'universe', 'ordered', 'strict', 'disciplinarian', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'take', 'random', 'indifferent', 'universe']",A Serious Man

An appreciation for Jewish culture would probably help in watching this film, but as someone who is only familiar with those traditions from late-night viewings of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Yentl"" on TV, I think the Coens manage to transcend the story's ethnic elements into an entertaining fable about fate and karma in suburban Minneapolis circa 1967, the same place and time when older brother Joel Coen would have been preparing for his bar mitzvah. That rite of passage is meticulously detailed with humor in this tale through bored adolescent Danny Gopnik, who would rather listen to the Jefferson Airplane through his transistor radio earplug.The movie starts unexpectedly in a shtetl somewhere in Eastern Europe back a century or so, when a poor man and his stoic wife are visited on a wintry night by a scholarly rabbi she knows had already died. When the mysterious man appears at their door, she stabs him to prove she's right, that he is a dybbuk, an undead spirit inhabiting the man's body. Flash forward to 1967 and we meet Larry Gopnik, a put-upon Jewish professor of physics surrounded by marijuana-smoking son Danny, constantly agitated daughter Sarah, thoroughly resigned wife Judith, and slovenly brother Arthur who refuses to leave the house as he works on some unwieldy numerological treatise. As Larry awaits approval of his tenure at the university, his life starts to fall apart piece by piece. Judith announces her intention to divorce him to marry their smarmy neighbor Sy Ableman, and he is forced to move to a nearby motel when she empties out their joint bank accounts.A Korean student named Clive insists the failing grade he received from Larry was unfair, and Larry then discovers an envelope with thousands of dollars inside. Pride overcomes temptation initially, but a series of unexpected events make the money more appear more desirable. To stave off his guilt and attempt to understand the root of his difficulties, Larry meets three distinctly different rabbis sequentially to sort out his troubles, but nothing seems to help. Once he makes up his mind about the money, fate seems to intervene again with even more dire consequences. There are no major stars in the cast, and stage actor Michael Stuhlbarg makes an auspicious starring debut effectively showing how Larry's soul slowly unravels despite his Newhart-like, button-down appearance. Perhaps intentionally with his glasses, he looks a lot like silent-screen comedianHarold Lloyd.A sturdy supporting cast complements the execution of the film - sitcom actor Richard Kind (Mad About You) as Arthur, sketch performer Sari Lennick as Judith, Aaron Wolff amusingly off-kilter as Danny, an avuncular Adam Arkin (Alan's son) as Larry's attorney, and George Wyner as the rabbi who shares the story of a dentist who notices a Hebrew message inscribed on the back of the teeth of an oblivious customer, a completely Coen-esque example of how the Hashem works in the most unusual ways. The story's period detail is presented immaculately between Roger Deakins' cinematography, Jess Gonchor's production design, and Mary Zophres' costume design.

By that he meant that writers should avoid the pitfalls of ""making a point."" In keeping with the Singeresque opening of A Serious Man, the Coen brothers should have followed the advice given by a man who really knew his dybbuks.A Serious Man lost its way almost immediately after that all-too-short Yiddish folk tale opening. (If they had only stayed in Poland, what a film it would have been!) As soon as the action moved into the 20th century the Coens' contract with the viewers was broken. Not only did they fail to tell a story, they failed to develop characters, or to provide a basis for caring about what happened to them. In fact, by the end of the film, I was longing for them all to die.As in all Coen brothers' films, the photography was atmospheric, crisp, innovative. There was an occasional good scene (the ancient rabbi quoting Gracie Slick was superb), but the thin infrastructure (i.e. lack of a plot), didn't support the better qualities of the film. The ending, to put it mildly, was a let-down. (You can't wrap up a story if there isn't one.)

In search of answers to the problems, he sees rabbis in his community, hoping some enlightenments. But there is never an easy answer and some problems even seem to have no answers at all. People deal with their problems in their own way. The junior rabbi Scott suggests it is a matter of seeing things. Rabbi Nachter contends there doesn't have to be answers. The most senior rabbi Marshak seems to be still struggling with his own lifetime quest for truth.If anything to be learned from this movie: life is full of problems, each of which needs a different answer.

1264747,A2BPDFR58H9575,B002E2M5IC,Galina,"[3, 4]","It's been mentioned many times that A Serious Man (2009) is a retelling of the Book of Job. Yes, it very well could be - as only Coen Brothers could adapt the Biblical story to the screen. They placed Job, the Schlimazel of the Old Testament in Minnesota suburbia of their own adolescent. They named him Larry Gopnik, made him a physics professor in a local college, a nice, loving, and pious  man,  and let  him watch hopelessly how his life is collapsing around him while he tries to make sense of what and why is happening to him and desperately seeks  a spiritual help from his religious advisors, three rabbis - in vain.  I would not say that A Serious Man is an autobiographical movie but it is set in the very atmosphere and spirit where two Coen boys grew up in the year 1967, the exact year Joel Coen turned 13 and was preparing for his own bar mitzvah - just like Danny Gopnik, 13 years old pot smoking Jefferson Airplane fan Larry's son whose Bar Mitzvah in the movie is a truly unforgettable event for many reasons.  Now, as the experienced celebrated illustrious filmmakers who have proved (at least for this viewer) to be among THE best modern filmmakers, Coens look back at the place and time that  shaped then as individuals, men, and creative personalities, and they ask the eternal and often impossible to answer questions. Does life has meaning? What is the point of it? Or there is no point at all? Why bad things happen to a decent person who ""did not do anything""? Is there any certainty in life or all we can do just accept the fact there is no explanation, no certainty, and no fairness and the best we could do - ""to receive with simplicity everything that happens to you."" I can understand that the film may be puzzling and even disappointing for many viewers even among the fans. The film is different and original even for Coens, always innovative and creative artists even though it is undeniably and unmistakably, their film. I actually wonder what took them so long to come up with this particular film. I also believe that it is among their very best, and I love everything they ever made.  Take for example the opening scene of the film, the black/white prologue spoken in Yiddish and set somewhere in Eastern Europe back in the 19th or 18th century, in a small Shtetl. It involves a married couple and their mysterious visitor who could be a dybbuck, an evil spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person.  The scene certainly stays with me and makes me return to it over and over trying to understand its meaning. As one of explanation, I see the husband and wife as the ancestors of Larry Gopnik before his family immigrated to the USA and ended up in Minnesota. The encounter with the dybbuk could bring the curse to the future generation, and that may explain all assortment of tsuris that poor Larry tries to deal with. Coens explained that they wanted to include a folk tale to set the tone in the film that explores among many things Jewish traditions, religion, faith, and character. They could not find a tale they'd like, so they wrote it and made a very stylish, ominously dark yet funny and mysterious opening to their film. As a perfect balance to the fairytale/ghost story opening, the final scene comes that literally can blow you away. As it has happened before in a Coens `movie  , the open ending has  as many admirers as haters but I believe it was no other way to finish the  film, and I found the ending perfect. In the universe that Coens create, they are God, truly Almighty and  Omnipresent.I am very impressed with the decisions of the directors to cast mostly unknown stage actors in the main roles, and everyone (I repeat, everyone) was up to their job. Michael Stuhlbarg positively shines as Larry and he makes one of the most sympathetic characters in Coens' movie. Sari Lennick, Richard Kind, Fred Melamed as a seriously creepy man whom Larry's wife Judith wanted to leave Larry for) as well as the rest of the cast are all memorable. I'd like to see them all again -maybe in the future Coens' film? :) Roger Deakins, the longtime collaborator of Coens has made ten films with them (the remake of upcoming True Grit is their #11 film). His work in A Serious Man in recreating the long gone era of the late 60s in the Middle of America is above any praise.In the end, I'd like to express my pleasure regarding the fact that Academy of Motion Pictures did not overlook the film and nominated it in the categories Best Picture of the Year and best original writing (Joel and Ethan share both nominations). Perhaps, the film doesn't have many chances to win in any of categories but with the nominations, Academy has shown good taste and class.I think of A Serious Man as one of the very best movies I've seen and as of now - one of my favorites. It is beautiful, profound, and perfectly well made. It is funny, too. Seriously.",5,"""The Uncertainty Principle proves we can't ever really know... what's going on.

The Coen Brothers also 'know' the lifestyles of American Jews to the bone, and I can testify to their authenticity, being married to a nice Jewish girl from Beverly hills, with a large Jewish kindred that has begun, after thirty years, to forget to notice that I'm not Jewish.The 'Minnesota' touches in ""A Serious Man"" were subtly satirical, though the humor may have been too ""in-group"" for anyone who lives within a few hours drive of an ocean. I laughed out loud at every appearance of Larry Gopnik's 'goyishe' neighbor.The portrayal of the Gopnik family and its insular Jewish community? Was it satirical or was it as 'serious' as Larry Gopnik tried to be? Ay, there's the rub! In many ways, it was devastatingly serious, a bluntly realistic depiction. My wife and I could identify each character in the film with someone in her family. And my wife's relatives, especially the older generation, hated this film, were offended by it, considered it a betrayal. In the film, all of humanity is either Jewish or goyish, and the goyim scarcely matter. Well, it's fair to say that many Jews of my acquaintance do think that way. After the most recent LA earthquake, for instance, I saw a headline in The Jewish Times: ""Massive Earthquake in Northridge: Four Jewish Homes Damaged."" But don't all ethnic and/or religious groups think that way? Do African-Americans or Chinese-Americans ever NOT notice who is and who isn't? Of course, that insularity is one of the themes of ""A Serious Man"" and the Coen Brothers don't refrain from mocking it fiercely. But one gets the feeling, in this film, that the subject is too immanent, too raw, for their usual absurdist humor. A quasi-insider like me will laugh, but uncomfortably.The other, even more serious theme of ""A Serious Man"" is the question of God's Providence for Man. Mathematics Professor Larry Gopnik, whose academic niche seems to be the 'proving of uncertainty', is going through a rough patch of life, a melange of minor annoyances and major catastrophes. The script implies that Gopnik has been a perfunctory Jew, one of the majority (I think) who identify with the culture and cling to the community but who are not 'serious' about their belief in God. (Or should I use another holy name? Y-hw-h. Ein Sof. Adonai.) His troubles - his tsuris - compel Larry Gopnik to seek advice and consolation from his Jewish world, specifically from his various Rabbis, none of whom has anything but platitudes and evasions to offer. Things do not get better for Larry in this film. This is no resolution, no intervention, unless one can be content to suppose that Larry is really under a curse, that Adonai has a grudge against him. For hapless farshlugener Larry, life has become just one d+mn thing after another.Is the film funny? Yes, I found it funny, but short of hilarious. The Brothers may have found themselves being too serious in trying to treat both sides of their identity - Minnesotans and Jews - in one script.Then is the film serious? Frankly, I have a hard time taking that question of God's Providence seriously. I haven't had the least doubt of the answer since I was nine or ten years old. But I'm sure that people who do take the question seriously will regard The Coen Brothers' treatment of it as superficial and unoriginal.",4,A Serious Movie,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,3952,"['fervent', 'movie', 'buffs', 'know', 'now', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'grew', 'up', 'Jewish', 'Minnesota', ""'know"", 'Minnesota', 'bone', 'proved', 'Fargo', 'still', 'favorite', 'films', 'deep', 'understanding', 'Minnesota', 'conviction', 'decency', 'will', 'prevail', 'depravity', 'even', 'only', 'naive', 'luck', 'was', 'born', 'Minnesota', 'spent', 'part', 'childhood', 'there', 'have', 'insider', 'response', 'depiction', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'films', 'Deep', 'South', 'Southern', 'California', 'are', 'satires', 'point', 'view', 'disrespectful', 'outsider', 'films', 'are', 'uproariously', 'funny', 'probably', 'objectionable', 'victims', 'satire', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'also', ""'know"", 'lifestyles', 'American', 'Jews', 'bone', 'can', 'testify', 'authenticity', 'being', 'married', 'nice', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'Beverly', 'hills', 'large', 'Jewish', 'kindred', 'begun', 'thirty', 'years', 'forget', 'notice', ""'m"", 'not', 'Jewish.The', ""'Minnesota"", 'touches', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'were', 'subtly', 'satirical', 'humor', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'in-group', 'anyone', 'who', 'few', 'hours', 'drive', 'ocean', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'appearance', 'Larry', 'Gopnik', ""'goyishe"", 'neighbor.The', 'portrayal', 'Gopnik', 'family', 'insular', 'Jewish', 'community', 'Was', 'satirical', 'was', ""'serious"", 'Larry', 'Gopnik', 'tried', 'be', 'Ay', 'rub', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'devastatingly', 'serious', 'bluntly', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'wife', 'could', 'identify', 'character', 'film', 'someone', 'family', 'wife', 'relatives', 'especially', 'older', 'generation', 'hated', 'film', 'were', 'offended', 'considered', 'betrayal', 'film', 'humanity', 'Jewish', 'goyish', 'goyim', 'scarcely', 'matter', 'Well', 'fair', 'say', 'many', 'Jews', 'acquaintance', 'do', 'think', 'way', 'most', 'recent', 'LA', 'earthquake', 'instance', 'saw', 'headline', 'Jewish', 'Times', 'Massive', 'Earthquake', 'Northridge', 'Four', 'Jewish', 'Homes', 'Damaged', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'ethnic', 'and/or', 'religious', 'groups', 'think', 'way', 'Do', 'African-Americans', 'Chinese-Americans', 'ever', 'NOT', 'notice', 'who', 'who', ""n't"", 'course', 'insularity', 'one', 'themes', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'do', ""n't"", 'refrain', 'mocking', 'fiercely', 'one', 'feeling', 'film', 'subject', 'too', 'immanent', 'too', 'raw', 'usual', 'absurdist', 'humor', 'quasi-insider', 'will', 'laugh', 'uncomfortably.The', 'other', 'even', 'more', 'serious', 'theme', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'question', 'God', 'Providence', 'Man', 'Mathematics', 'Professor', 'Larry', 'Gopnik', 'academic', 'niche', 'be', ""'proving"", 'uncertainty', 'going', 'rough', 'patch', 'life', 'melange', 'minor', 'annoyances', 'major', 'catastrophes', 'script', 'Gopnik', 'been', 'perfunctory', 'Jew', 'one', 'majority', 'think', 'who', 'identify', 'culture', 'cling', 'community', 'who', 'are', 'not', ""'serious"", 'belief', 'God', 'should', 'use', 'holy', 'name', 'Y-hw-h.', 'Ein', 'Sof', 'Adonai', 'troubles', 'tsuris', 'compel', 'Larry', 'Gopnik', 'seek', 'advice', 'consolation', 'Jewish', 'world', 'specifically', 'various', 'Rabbis', 'none', 'whom', 'anything', 'platitudes', 'evasions', 'offer', 'Things', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'Larry', 'film', 'resolution', 'intervention', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'content', 'suppose', 'Larry', 'really', 'curse', 'Adonai', 'grudge', 'hapless', 'farshlugener', 'Larry', 'life', 'become', 'just', 'one', 'd+mn', 'thing', 'another.Is', 'film', 'funny', 'Yes', 'found', 'funny', 'short', 'hilarious', 'Brothers', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'being', 'too', 'serious', 'trying', 'treat', 'sides', 'identity', 'Minnesotans', 'Jews', 'one', 'script.Then', 'film', 'serious', 'Frankly', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'taking', 'question', 'God', 'Providence', 'seriously', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'least', 'doubt', 'answer', 'was', 'nine', 'ten', 'years', 'old', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'take', 'question', 'seriously', 'will', 'regard', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'treatment', 'superficial', 'unoriginal']",A Serious Man

They are an acquired taste.A SERIOUS MAN has a fascinating overture  - a dark drama in Yiddish about a curse, a dybbuk ('In Jewish folklore, a disembodied human spirit that must wander restlessly, burdened by former sins, until it inhabits the body of a living person') and then plops us down in Minneapolis in a Jewish neighborhood inhabited by a strange group of folk - Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) who copes with the inanities of teaching Physics while coping with a venomous Korean student unhappy with his failing grade, an inane tenure committee, a son readying himself for Bar MItzvah while running from his dope dealer, a redneck neighbor on one side and a vamp on the other side of his home that is being torn apart by a wife wanting a Jewish style divorce to marry Larry's best friend and a brother who is a live-in raunch, among other distractions.  Somehow winding through these 'curses' we get to know the real serious man and all the foibles that mark life among these weird characters.

From the perfect synchrony between the physics concepts Gopnik teaches and the form and content of the film, to the great characters and perfect acting, A Serious Man doesn't miss a beat. It follows a physics professor whose life is falling to pieces. Ironically, his decline mirrors the very concepts he teaches to his students, but he can't quite grasp the application to the real world. He focuses on the math, but doesn't understand that the principles apply to life as well. As such, he refuses to SEE the reality of his situation, the causal factors that are leading to his crises, and that his lack of objectivity in this regard is the very thing that keeps things from getting better.At the end of the film there is a scene where Gopnik makes a choice and the consequences are immediate, as if the phone call he receives was a collapse of quantum probabilities determined by his own state as the quantum ""observer"" and the choice he just made. He constantly refuses gnosis (""I don't want Santana *Abraxas*!""), sees only the chaos, and is thus at its mercy. He is slave to the law of accident, it the terms of Mouravieff'sGnosis. The dynamic is explained in depth in Laura Knight-Jadczyk's secondWave book. When everything he thought was true turned out to be a lie, then what? He did nothing, and his life was the direct result.

1264751,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002E2M5IC,Haunted Flower,"[1, 2]","The Coen brothers - it always either works big time or is just ok. This movie worked big time for me. ""A Serious Man"" was written and directed by Ethan and Joel Coen. The Coen brothers other movies that really have stuck with me are ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", and this one. I love the way the Coen brothers always completely immerse themselves in a culture with each of these movies. They don't go halfway, you get every bit of it. Does every bit of it make sense? There's always a scene or two that will leave you puzzled and make you wonder why it was even necessary but I guess that's part of their creative process in establishing their setting. The intro to this movie had nothing to do with the rest, but I was still fascinated by it.It stars Michael Stuhlbarg as Larry Gopnik, a Jewish man facing a lot of escalating problems that stack up as the movie goes on. His brother played by Richard Kind is a nuisance who mooches off him, sleeps on the couch, and gets into trouble with the law. His wife played by Sari Lennick wants a divorce and has already picked out someone to remarry played by Fred Melamed. His son is getting ready for his barmitzvah but also owes a pot dealer money. Problem after problem and it seems like no one really listens or has good advice for him. Michael Stuhlbarg really sells us the persona of a good man, trying sooo hard to do the right thing, be a good person and doesn't consider for a moment getting really upset with his wife or kicking his brother out. He is so earnest and so desperate (and so funny) in this dark comedy.This wouldn't work without the other supporting cast members delving deeply into the Jewish culture for us to get a sense of this society in the 1960s. Absolutely fabulous performances by Sari Lennick and Fred Melamed in particular. Also Richard Kind is still the king of playing that guy, that mooch of a guy that's always there and you have a hard time saying no to.I loved the set up, the music, the drama, the darkness, the off-the-wall stories and comic moments, the suspense, and the surprise dream sequences (one of which got me GOOD, I jumped!).

His psychologically impaired brother has moved in, stirring up even more domestic turmoil.  He is up for tenure but someone has been sending anonymous letters of complaint about him to university officials.  He has to deal with a difficult Korean student, and the student's father, who offer to bribe him in exchange for a passing grade.

Even though I don't agree with, or like, the movie's message, I still respect and admire the way it has been put on film.Aside from the fact that it probably helps to be Jewish (I'm not) when digesting the film, the only problem I have with it is that I kept waiting in vain to find out the significance of the film's beginning: a supernatural(?) scene in what appears to be 19h century Poland.  I don't know if I missed it, but I was unable to see any connection between this opening and the rest of the movie.With all the garbage that is churned out by Hollywood nowadays, A SERIOUS MAN is a real gem of a flick, albeit an ultimately depressing one.",5,Haym Salomon Airplane,1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,1671,"['What', 'wry', 'comedy', 'special', ""n't"", 'humour', ""'ll"", 'have', 'smile', 'face', 'much', 'time', 'certainly', 'not', 'ending', 'were', 'only', 'couple', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'Rather', 'thought-provoking', 'stimulating', 'storyline', 'Jewish', 'college', 'professor', 'Larry', 'Gopnik', 'life', 'be', 'unraveling', 'who', 'seeks', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'vain.His', 'wife', 'leaving', 'man', 'psychologically', 'impaired', 'brother', 'moved', 'stirring', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'domestic', 'turmoil', 'up', 'tenure', 'someone', 'been', 'sending', 'anonymous', 'letters', 'complaint', 'university', 'officials', 'deal', 'difficult', 'Korean', 'student', 'student', 'father', 'who', 'offer', 'bribe', 'exchange', 'passing', 'grade', 'money', 'problems.Gopnik', 'something', 'pathetic', 'sap', 'who', 'could', 'solve', 'problems', 'just', 'standing', 'up', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'apparently', 'control', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'Schopenhauer', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'movie', 'message', 'still', 'respect', 'admire', 'way', 'been', 'put', 'film.Aside', 'fact', 'probably', 'be', 'Jewish', ""'m"", 'not', 'when', 'digesting', 'film', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'kept', 'waiting', 'vain', 'find', 'out', 'significance', 'film', 'beginning', 'supernatural', 'scene', 'what', 'be', '19h', 'century', 'Poland', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'missed', 'was', 'unable', 'see', 'connection', 'opening', 'rest', 'movie.With', 'garbage', 'churned', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'nowadays', 'A', 'SERIOUS', 'MAN', 'real', 'gem', 'flick', 'ultimately', 'depressing', 'one']",A Serious Man
1264757,A18MEO51KI240X,B002E2M5IC,J D,"[5, 9]","Weird or pointless movies can be original and even good as the Coen Brothers have shown in ""Fargo"" and other films. However, if that is the only kind of film you make, no matter how artfully done, it becomes boring and is no longer new. This film has some value to non-Jews who are curious about some of the faith's terms, practices, beliefs, etc. However, a documentary would have been a much better way to learn. The characters use all kinds of Hebrew terms in the movie and it must have been perplexing for non-Jews in the theaters. On the DVD they give you a dictionary so you can translate. The brothers try to make the film somewhat interesting by putting this Jewish family in the 1960's Midwest (mainly because that is where and when they grew up) and have things go wrong in the father's life but to me it was a pointless, tedious mess. Lots of great production design and CGI work done in the service of a story with no reason for being. They tack on a silly made-up fable before the main titles that runs for around 10 minutes and has NOTHING to do with the movie. The Brothers even admit they just wanted to make a short fable so they used this movie to film one. It adds nothing to the film's story but I guess if someone else is footing the bill, why not? They even say it is like a cartoon before a movie. It is non even a real Jewish fable, it is totally from their imagination and plays more like a Stephen King short. Thanks for wasting my time, Coens. The reason I give this movie two stars is because the actors do a great job with very little to work with. It is sad to see talent wasted on a truly wretched script. Starting with a pointless fable and ending with head-scratching tornado, this movie seems to have been made on LSD. Black comedy? Nope.

Now, I can see why the cinema owners didn't want to lose their shirts on this hideous misfire that might appeal to maybe one viewer--that would be the local newspaper movie critic who still thinks ""Citizen Kane"" is the greatest movie ever made.For one thing, unless you're Jewish, nearly 98 per cent of this movie makes zero sense. The ""serious man""--played with infuriating vagueness by Michael Stuhlburg--is being divorced by his hideous slob of a wife who has the hots for another hideous man whose also Jewish. In other brainless scenes that no one can understand is the sub-plot of the brainless son who keeps running into his home from a bully. Oh, yes. There's the repeated plot line of him tellin his father that the TV aerial needs to be adjusted because favorite TV channels can't be seen.There are endless shots of someone putting a record needle on a 33 1/3 record to listen to Jewish music or instructions and then there are endless dream sequences where you FINALLY see something interesting and colorful but these end up with the serious man waking up in a sweat. Haven't we all seen this same worn-out device in countless horror flicks made on $1.99 budgets-which, come to think of, looks exactly like this idiotic travesty.We all know that ""the serious man"" is really a poor ole wimp because the Cohen Brothers dress him up in exactly the identical wardrobe of countless other wimps we see in horny teen adventures and modern tales of misfits--he wears his trousers too short with the cuffs almost halfway up his legs.As to the usual crtics who gave this exercise in idiocy 4 star raves, I do wish that for punishment they would be forced to sit in a room where the Coen Brothers Production of ""A Serious Man"" unreels non-stop around the clock.

The Book of Job from the Hebrew Bible is all too apparent an inspiration for the Coen brothers' ""A Serious Man,"" but the various plot elements of ""A Serious Man"" are too scattered.  The movie concerns a college professor who ""has done nothing wrong"" -- he is not inspiring but he is competent, he is not loving but he is faithful, he is not great but he is honest.  He manages to get by, and he closes to his mind to the rest of the world, and that could well be the reason why his world is falling apart around him:  his wife cheats on him and considers him at fault, his Korean student tries to bribe him and then insists he is in the wrong, and his neighbor infringes on his property and when he complains menaces him.  Wherever he goes this timid and frail college professor cannot find help:  his lawyer dies of a heart attack in front of him, his rabbis mutter nonsense to him, his brother is even more helpless than him, and he's plagued by nightmares as he tries stoically to get by.  As his life spirals out of control, he keeps on chanting to himself and to others:  ""I have done nothing wrong.""  When, at last, he thinks his life is put right, new bigger disasters appear on the horizon.I really didn't understand the movie, and maybe it's because I'm not Jewish and attuned to all that Jewish wisdom and stories ingrained and inherent in the religion.  But something also tells me that the Coen brothers here are playing a game.  As they play God and put their protagonist through a series of random punishments and dare him to find meaning and reason in them, they're also daring us to find meaning and reason in the chaos and randomness of this movie.  Just as the physics college professor, who's believed all his life that there's an intricate logic to the universe that can be explained by mathematics, discovers there's no meaning to things and that he ought to just accept, we must also learn to accept that there may be no logic to a Coen brothers' film -- you either enjoy it or you do not.

1264764,ARK323I3EV98D,B002E2M5IC,Jordan D. Wilson,"[1, 2]","Joel and Ethan Coen have time and time again managed to take us on the strangest and most fascinating journeys. With indelible characters that are alive, and possess the quirkiest of qualities, and worlds that are as odd and captivating, the brothers always manage to create something that has never been seen before, but is, at the same time, oh so familiar to us all. I don't think that anyone sees the world quite the same way that they do, and with A Serious Man, their collective vision has conjured up what may be the most personal film of their career. It is also one of the best.The movie begins with a prologue of sorts, entirely spoken in Yiddish. A wife quarrels with her husband after he invites a dybbuk (Fyvush Finkel), a spirit from beyond the grave, into their house. This opening segment doesn't so much set up the main story as set the tone for the rest of the film. It is richly drawn out for suspense, and darkly comic, in traditional Coen brothers fashion. I at first thought the prologue may be an actual Yiddish folk tale, but I did some research, and as it turns out, it is entirely original. It is also delightfully off-putting in the finest possible way.After this prologue, the main story begins in 1967. It revolves around Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor who is questioning his own purpose and existence as his life seems to be slipping out of grasp, to put it lightly. His wife, Judith (Sari Lennick), wants a divorce so that she can remarry their neighbor, Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), a widower whose wife's body is ""barely cold"", and who is also Larry's ""best friend."" This is just the tip of the iceberg. Larry also deals with a disgruntled student whose bribe for a passing grade turns into blackmail, a woman sunbathing nude next door, and his brother Arthur (Richard Kind), who is staying on the couch, but is almost always in the bathroom, endlessly draining his cyst.Larry attempts to understand why so many terrible things are happening to him, and throughout the course of the film, receives no concrete answers. He sees two rabbis, and fails to see a third. His visit with the second unveils an utterly enigmatic story of a dentist who finds the words ""Help me"" in Yiddish on the tooth mould of an oblivious gentile customer.Michael Stuhlbarg is terrific in this film, and he plays Larry as a very likeable guy. It's as if at every catastrophe, he is watching the storm in shock and awe, wondering how this could be happening to him. As things escalate, and become increasingly worse, instead of giving Larry a breaking point, Stuhlbarg levels off at his peak of disbelief and tries to allow the character to come to terms with the situation, and to deal with it. This, of course, is ultimately an impossible task seeing as how God, or Hashem, is as ruthless to Larry as he was to Job.Fred Melamed made me cringe in every one of his scenes. Sy's pompousness and calm are so potent, and his interactions with Larry are not for the impatient. They are downright frustrating, and it is a joy to watch Larry burn under the surface of his disbelief. The Coens are masters of these kinds of awkward interactions, and their writing and direction in this is flawless, as is the cinematography by Coen brothers regular, Roger Deakins. It is the movie that Joel and Ethan Coen needed to make, and to follow the deeply flawed, but hysterical, Burn After Reading with such an existential masterpiece is what the world of cinema needed.*On a side note, Carter Burwell's score is genius as usual, but Jefferson Airplane's ""Somebody to Love"" is the true anthem for this film.

1264765,AABGV02YMQ2OZ,B002E2M5IC,"J. Ryan ""JRyan""","[3, 5]","The Coen brothers are some of the most respected and acclaimed directors in all of Hollywood. They have been making films for over two decades now and have spun out a wide array of films. From the hilarious, endlessly quotable and dorm-room essential The Big Lebowski to the brutally intense moral drama No Country for Old Men, each Coen brother's flick is tagged with their unique visual style, dark and subtle humor, and most often, technical brilliance.  Their latest and easily most personal film to-date, A Serious Man is no exception.  While the movie is extremely well made and offers a very insightful take on some existential life issues, as a movie-going experience, something felt lacking to me.Larry Gopnick (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a Physics professor who, from the very start of the film, just can't seem to catch a break. He has a deadbeat brother living in his house, unforeseen events begin to threaten his chance to obtain tenure, his stoner son is days away from his bar mitzvah, and on top of all of that, his wife is demanding a divorce. As his life continues to spiral downward through a series of unforeseen and ill-timed events, Larry consults three different rabbis in a vein and desperate attempt to attach some semblance of meaning to all of this.The problem with Larry and what makes all of this so trying for him is that he is a serious man.  For him, everything needs to be in its right place, and right now, nothing at all in his life is in order and he somehow needs to fix this. As the film goes on, it becomes clear that there aren't any answers for his problems. There is no rhyme or reason for anything that is happening to him. The Coen brothers message here is that what is happening to him isn't any punishment from ""Hashem"" (God) that he needs reconcile to make this all end. He's just going through life, and sometimes life can be a little rough. The opening quote of the movie can almost be thought of as a message to Larry; ""receive with simplicity everything that happens to you."" Larry is just taking this all too seriously. When things go bad, he is looking for answers when, as the Jefferson Airplane song that plays throughout the film says, he just needs to ""find somebody to love"".From a technical and visual perspective, the film is excellent, but the movie as a whole I felt was much too bleak and cynical. Because of this I felt alienated as a viewer and found it almost grueling to sit through at times. I guess I just hoped Larry would catch a break. After all he went through in this film, I guess I thought he deserved one.Grade: 6.4/10-Jeffrey Ryan[...]",3,Can't a guy catch a break?,1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,2609,"['Coen', 'brothers', 'are', 'most', 'respected', 'acclaimed', 'directors', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'films', 'two', 'decades', 'now', 'have', 'spun', 'out', 'wide', 'array', 'films', 'hilarious', 'endlessly', 'quotable', 'dorm-room', 'essential', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'brutally', 'intense', 'moral', 'drama', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Coen', 'brother', 'flick', 'tagged', 'unique', 'visual', 'style', 'dark', 'subtle', 'humor', 'most', 'often', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'latest', 'easily', 'most', 'personal', 'film', 'to-date', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'exception', 'movie', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'very', 'insightful', 'take', 'existential', 'life', 'issues', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'something', 'felt', 'lacking', 'me.Larry', 'Gopnick', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'Physics', 'professor', 'who', 'very', 'start', 'film', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'break', 'deadbeat', 'brother', 'living', 'house', 'unforeseen', 'events', 'begin', 'threaten', 'chance', 'obtain', 'tenure', 'stoner', 'son', 'days', 'away', 'bar', 'mitzvah', 'top', 'wife', 'demanding', 'divorce', 'life', 'spiral', 'downward', 'series', 'unforeseen', 'ill-timed', 'events', 'Larry', 'consults', 'three', 'different', 'rabbis', 'vein', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'attach', 'semblance', 'meaning', 'this.The', 'problem', 'Larry', 'what', 'so', 'trying', 'serious', 'man', 'everything', 'needs', 'be', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'now', 'nothing', 'life', 'order', 'somehow', 'fix', 'film', 'clear', 'are', ""n't"", 'answers', 'problems', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'anything', 'happening', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'message', 'here', 'what', 'happening', ""n't"", 'punishment', 'Hashem', 'God', 'reconcile', 'make', 'end', 'just', 'going', 'life', 'sometimes', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'rough', 'opening', 'quote', 'movie', 'can', 'almost', 'be', 'thought', 'message', 'Larry', 'receive', 'simplicity', 'everything', 'Larry', 'just', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'When', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'looking', 'answers', 'when', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'song', 'film', 'just', 'find', 'somebody', 'love', 'technical', 'visual', 'perspective', 'film', 'excellent', 'movie', 'whole', 'felt', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'bleak', 'cynical', 'felt', 'alienated', 'viewer', 'found', 'almost', 'grueling', 'sit', 'times', 'guess', 'just', 'hoped', 'Larry', 'would', 'catch', 'break', 'went', 'film', 'guess', 'thought', 'deserved', 'one.Grade', '6.4/10-Jeffrey', 'Ryan', '[', ']']",A Serious Man

I found all sorts of reasons to not like it, in fact, but the sheer brilliance of the brothers Coen as filmmakers and writers is impossible to dismiss even here.Suffice to say, you've got a much better chance of appreciating this if you enjoy watching people suffer, a constant barrage of all things Jewish and suburban, or enjoy others' lack of enjoyment. This film is mainly focused on those three things, and while its constant and overloaded sense of irony is its saving grace, it's also just plain aggravating after a while. I don't much enjoy an excess of any of the above three categories, and if this had been made by anyone other than the Coens it would be two stars.But of course no one else could have made this, and certainly nowhere near as tightly. The acting is uniformly excellent, the set design and photography near-perfect, and the stoned bar mitzvah is certainly a unique scene (autobiographical?). It's also a mercifully short film--thanks for that!--and does contain a decent number of very funny moments. The kid who can't speak without using the f-bomb (we all knew one of them), Larry's laughably fake and duplicitous wife and ""best friend"", the selfishness disguised as religious piety and caring cultural awareness, and the spot-on recreations of suburban 1967, just before the hippie vibe hit America full on, are all well worth frequent chuckles. Yet there's also so much unhappiness suffusing almost every scene that unless you're in the mood for this sort of extremely dyspeptic humor, A Serious Man has a good chance of sending you into A Serious Bummer.But I'm pretty sure the Coens made this mainly to humor themselves, and as a touchstone for them to revel in as their days shrink in number. And who can deny them that pleasure? They've given us so many classics already, so let them have their fun. Just know that their fun is clearly not everyone else's, and in fact that seems to be the point here. I imagine that if one grew up in their world that this would be a masterpiece. One thing for sure: I'm deeply glad I didn't grow up in their world!And I guess that I'm glad they did, for that perspective has created some of the best celluloid art of the past two decades plus. That many fans don't love this one hardly puts a dent in the Coen oeuvre.

The protagonist, Larry Gopnik, is searching for meaning and understanding in a world devoid of both. He is a &#34;serious man&#34; in a world that is anything but serious. The theme that wisdom and tradition are of no help runs through the film. Gopnik's brother, who appears to have solved the secret of chance through an abstruse calculation, is brought up on child molestation charges. Gopnik consults the younger rabbi, whose advice boils down to finding beauty in a parking lot. The older rabbi tells the story of &#34;the goy's teeth,&#34; where Hebrew letters spelling out the words &#34;help me&#34; are inscribed on the back of a man's incisors. In the end, this is a miraculous event for which the rabbi finds no meaning or explanation. The tantalizing prospect of meeting the old rabbi, Marshak, who apparently limits his visitors to boys on the eve of their Bar Mitzvah, turns out to be the dispensation of wisdom by quoting the lyrics of a Jefferson Airplane song.The characters' lives are ruled by the capricious forces of chance, and if any overarching force for order is taking any interest, it is primarily harsh and swift judgment. At the moment when Larry decides to take the bribe to pass the Korean student, to pay for his brother's legal defense, the phone rings with his doctor calling with bad news. The film ends with an approaching tornado; as the students huddle in anticipation, the teacher fumbles with the keys to the shelter.The wisdom of the wise is of no avail, tradition offers no guidance, and G-d, if He exists, is deliberately obscure. And if you attempt to take your fate into your own hands, you will be destroyed.

1264773,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B002E2M5IC,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 3]","I had never heard of this 2009 Coen Brothers' film even though it was nominated for two Academy Awards - one for best film of the year and another for best writing.  That's why I am so glad it was available on my local cable station.  It's an offbeat dark comedy that seems to be a labor of love for the Coen Brothers as it's set in 1967 in a Jewish suburb of Minneapolis, much like the suburb of their childhood. There's a weird introduction set a century ago in Europe and filmed in Yiddish with English subtitles in which a couple lets an elderly man into their home who might be a dybbuk (an evil spirit).  It is only later that we realize that this dybbuk has cursed the future generations of that family with a whole series of rather comic misfortunes.  This story is, in effect, a modern interpretation of the Book of Job.  And it is only because of the Coen Brothers extreme talent in producing it that I found myself sometimes laughing out loud.In a stunning performance Micheal Stahlberg is cast as Professor Larry Gopnik, a physics teacher who writes dozens of equations on the blackboard which his students find quite boring.  He's a poor soul who just can't seem to get anything right.  His wife wants a divorce, his children don't respect him, the man in his wife's life tries to befriend him, his lawyer can't help him, the rabbi and the dentist give him meaningless advice and no matter how hard he tries, life just keeps getting worse.  All this is told with restrained humor and pathos.

It shows a peasant coming home in a snowstorm after his cart broke down.  He tells his wife he was helped by Reb Groshkover (Fyvush Finkel) and he invited him in for soup.  The wife is upset and says that Reb is dead, and has been for over three years.  He must have met a dybbuk (a ghost - or undead being).  The guest is adament he is not a dybbuk and the wife stabs him to prove it.  The guest totters out to the cold blizzard.Set in 1967, this is a satisfying movie showing how Larry Gopnik, (Michael Stuhlbarg), a Jewish man, searches for moral clarity in an ambiguous life.  He feels lost and aghast that his life was all a lie when his wife (Sari Lennick) asks for divorce,  he is tempted by a seductive neighbor, his unemployed brother's excapades, his children's rebellions (smoking pot, stealing money from his billfold), and getting tenure as a professor at a small college in Minnesota.  The scene opens with his discussion with a Asian student.  The student is getting an ""F"" and he wants a passing grade.  First he asks to take the test over.  Professor Gopnik  holds firm the grade will not be changed.  The student leaves an envelope full of cash (as a bribe).The film shows Larry searching for the reason he is living and making sense of what is happening.  His wife blindsides him when she asks for a divorce to marry the widower, Sy Abelman, a close friend to both.  Larry is asked to move out of his home to the ""Jolly Roger"" with his jobless brother-in-law.  Larry questions his life and meets with three different Rabbi's who give somewhat bland and non-fulfilling answers on what life is about and how to deal with it.While his wife and Sy Ableman make plans for the future, his brother becomes more annoying and dependent, a nasty letter writer tries to hurt Larry's chances for promotion, Larry seeks advice from three different rabbis. He wants to do the right thing and move on.  Larry wants to be a serious man.It is a entertaining dark comedy, that gives some clarity to moral choice at the end.",5,Dark Comedy and Morality Play -,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,2103,"['brief', 'opening', 'scene', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'Sort', 'Yiddish', 'tale', 'peasant', 'coming', 'home', 'snowstorm', 'cart', 'broke', 'down', 'wife', 'was', 'helped', 'Reb', 'Groshkover', 'Fyvush', 'Finkel', 'invited', 'soup', 'wife', 'upset', 'Reb', 'dead', 'been', 'three', 'years', 'must', 'have', 'met', 'dybbuk', 'ghost', 'undead', 'being', 'guest', 'adament', 'not', 'dybbuk', 'wife', 'stabs', 'prove', 'guest', 'totters', 'out', 'cold', 'blizzard.Set', '1967', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'showing', 'how', 'Larry', 'Gopnik', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'Jewish', 'man', 'searches', 'moral', 'clarity', 'ambiguous', 'life', 'lost', 'life', 'was', 'lie', 'when', 'wife', 'Sari', 'Lennick', 'divorce', 'tempted', 'seductive', 'neighbor', 'unemployed', 'brother', 'excapades', 'children', 'rebellions', 'smoking', 'pot', 'stealing', 'money', 'billfold', 'getting', 'tenure', 'professor', 'small', 'college', 'Minnesota', 'scene', 'discussion', 'Asian', 'student', 'student', 'getting', 'F', 'passing', 'grade', 'First', 'take', 'test', 'Professor', 'Gopnik', 'firm', 'grade', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'changed', 'student', 'envelope', 'full', 'cash', 'bribe', '.The', 'film', 'shows', 'Larry', 'searching', 'reason', 'living', 'making', 'sense', 'what', 'happening', 'wife', 'blindsides', 'when', 'divorce', 'marry', 'widower', 'Sy', 'Abelman', 'close', 'friend', 'Larry', 'asked', 'move', 'home', 'Jolly', 'Roger', 'jobless', 'brother-in-law', 'Larry', 'questions', 'life', 'meets', 'three', 'different', 'Rabbi', 'who', 'give', 'somewhat', 'bland', 'non-fulfilling', 'answers', 'what', 'life', 'about', 'how', 'deal', 'it.While', 'wife', 'Sy', 'Ableman', 'make', 'plans', 'future', 'brother', 'more', 'annoying', 'dependent', 'nasty', 'letter', 'writer', 'tries', 'hurt', 'Larry', 'chances', 'promotion', 'Larry', 'advice', 'three', 'different', 'rabbis', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'move', 'Larry', 'be', 'serious', 'man.It', 'entertaining', 'dark', 'comedy', 'clarity', 'moral', 'choice', 'end']",A Serious Man

Although one could say that the pace of the movie is slow, I think it allowed for some extraordinarily fine character development and the acting was completely outstanding from these actors some of whom are largely unknown. The choreography and the cinematography shine and the script was brilliantly written; there's scarcely a minute flaw in this remarkable movie.When the action begins, we are treated to an elaborate opening which takes place in an eastern European village over a hundred tears ago; although brief this sequence manages to explore life, death, luck and relationships in a very concise way without ever providing concrete answers to the issues discussed by the characters. This sequence also lays the groundwork for the main portion of the movie. We then meet mathematics Professor Lawrence 'Larry' Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) who experiences life as a series of events that either take him by complete surprise or grab him by the throat and never let him take control. Lawrence is a passive man out of touch with himself and his family; but yet his inability to find meaning for major life events is something we all can relate to at least now and then in our lives. Larry is stunned to hear from his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) that she wants a divorce as well as a Jewish ritual to end the marriage; Judith has found romance with Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed) and she wants Larry and his mooching brother Arthur (Richard Kind) out of the house very quickly. At the same time, poor Larry tries to cope with the sudden and understandably upsetting deaths of a lawyer and someone else (I can't say who without giving something away so I won't name names here).Worse yet for poor Larry, he's oblivious to the fact that his son Danny (Aaron Wolff) is experimenting with drugs and ordering record albums all the while charging it to Larry; and it's not any better when the FBI come to Larry's home to inform his brother Arthur that he better not be caught gambling again! In addition, Larry is pestered by a young Korean student (David Kang) who has failed the mid-term exam; the student and eventually even his father try to bride and intimidate Larry into giving him a passing grade. Even Larry's next door neighbor Mr. Brandt (Peter Breitmayer) causes trouble for Larry.Larry tries to find answers and meaning for what happens in his life; his lawyers almost always tell him that he's in a real mess. Larry also goes to Rabbis for help but finds no clear-cut answers because the Rabbis lack concrete and profound answers themselves. Look for great cameos by George Wyner as Rabbi Nachtner and Simon Helberg as Rabbi Scott. Alan Mandell does a good job of playing Rabbi Marshak, too.The DVD comes with a couple of nice extras as well.A Serious Man paints an unforgettable portrait of a man, a type of everyman, who tries desperately to understand why bad things happen to him in his life; Michael Stuhlbarg gives a stunning performance that you really should see. While it may seem as if I've given it all away, I assure you that I haven't and the emotional effect this film will have on you will not be lessened one bit by what I've written here. Don't pass on this excellent film; it will provide you with so many meaningful issues to think and talk about with your friends and loved ones.

They gravitate toward film noir, because existential crime films of the 1940s posited a chaotic universe in which protagonists struggled to create order, or just to survive, in the midst of events that buffeted them about and mocked their complaints. But in ""A Serious Man"", no one is being chased or giving chase. There is no crime, no shootings, or thrills. There is Larry Gropnik, a Jewish family man living an ordinary life in a midwestern suburb, 1967.Larry's (Michael Shahlbarg) world is coming apart. Everything he ""felt was one way turns out to be another"". He's pressured from all directions, but none of it makes sense to him. His wife Judith (Sari Lennick) wants a divorce so that she can marry Larry's coworker and family friend Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed). One of Larry's physics students tries to bribe him to pass the course. Someone is writing libelous letters to the tenure committee. His socially inept brother Arthur (Richard Kind) won't move out of the house. Arthur is working on a probability map of the universe to make sense of it all. And preparations are under way for son Danny's (Aaron Wolff) Bar Mitzvah.Coen brothers fans will like or hate ""A Serious Man"" depending upon whether they like the idea of an existential crisis brought on by a fundamentally disordered universe being transferred into an ordinary environment. Larry isn't coping with criminal intrigue but with his inability to make sense of the everyday and his obsessive desire to do so. ""What's going on?"" is Larry's refrain as well as the film's. In a bit of daring, ""A Serious Man"" mocks the idea that religion has anything to offer people seeking life's meaning. It likes Larry but laughs at his angst. The re-creation of the post-War suburbs with a cultural revolution just around the corner makes this a sharp period film too.The DVD (Universal 2010): There are 3 featurettes. ""Becoming Serious"" (17 min) interviews the Coens and the film's producers about making the film and the actors about their characters. ""Creating 1967"" (14 min) gives us a tour of some sets and visits the locations with production coordinator Jess Gonchor and special effects supervisor Larz Anderson.

His delivery of his character is excellent and despite the relatively slow pace you are entertained all the way through.Being a great lover of movies 'with a message' I must agree with earlier reviews that this one does hold one, and challenges the viewer to think; A bit - but no more - unless your aim with movie reviews is to over analyse and see sublimilal messages behind every line and scene.Enough said - a fine little movie that keeps you entertained and makes you think - a bit - which is reason enough to see it.

I want to give this 1 star because it had no real plot, filled with random unrelated events and characters that were half introduced then dropped like an unconvincing T-ranny at the first sight/sound of a police siren.  Seriously the characters were barely introduced, and none were well rounded, except the lead, which was barely a rounded character.  The reason that I'm not giving this a 1 star is that I guess this is made for 9th English class, in some kind of silly allegory way.  I love movies with a subtext, but they should still be movies that can stand on their own first, then have another layer built in.

I'm fine with movies with an interpretive ending, but that would require a beginning and a middle of the movie that was remotely interesting and engaging.  This had none of these attributes.

The ending is left open for a reason, how do you end this kind of film?...with an ambiguous open to self interpretation type of ending, that's how.As you watch this poor guy go through lots of unpleasant and stressful situations(even the Columbia House Record Club scam seems a bigger problem because it's just piled on top of everything else), as we overhear a conversation with his Dr. over the phone, he learns at the very end of the film that he could have a serious illness and looking at the sky outside there's a good chance that his family and property could be in immediate and serious jeopardy!The ending to me basically says, no matter how bad you think your life is, it could be worse.....much worse!

Sure, a bad film is pretty bad. But a film that is rated much higher than it deserves certainly is worse in the sense that the film is hyped and has much potential but falters in its ability to deliver.Maybe the Coens just set the bar too high with No Country. That film is untouchable, near flawless. That film was so brilliant that hell, even Fargo and The Big Lebowski, both excellent films, paled in comparison. Sure, Burn After Reading was bad (and they did have, I believe, one clunker before that, which was the hilariously awful Barton Fink), but this goes too far.The only thing even remotely remarkable about the film is the ending, where the school is evacuated due to a tornado warning, and the film's final shot, of the young man watching the oncoming twister, a powerful moment. I'm not saying films have to have tornadoes in them to be good, I just expect a movie to be entertaining, even if it's poorly written. I can forgive a bad movie if its at least entertaining, but this isn't it.The writing is awful. The dialogue seems to be written by an immature 14 year old. Mind you this is the same Coen Brothers that gave us No Country For Old Men, Fargo, Blood Simple, and The Man Who Wasn't There. The editing is sloppy; most of the film consists of people staring for a really long time without dialogue. Granted if you removed all the ""long stares"" this film would be about 45-50 minutes long. The characters are all just stereotypes of not just Jewish characters but characters we've seen before (mind you I'm part-Jewish). The acting wasn't too bad, a little wooden at times but I think they did good for the lousy film they had to work on.As for getting a best picture nomination... when No Country won best picture in 2008, I was filled with joy, shouted ""YES"", and jumped up and down in happiness. This getting nominated for best picture??? Please, it's in the runnings with Transformers 2: Revenge of the Boring in terms of godawfulness (and I said the same thing about the equally awful ""The Hurt Locker"").I've said it once and I'll say it again, people are sheep. That is the only way people like this crap enough to inflate its rating to 7.2/10 on IMDb. I'm sure the ""art house"" crowd will tell me how I'm wrong and how I don't get it.

The irreverence given to the Jewish lifestyle (and the traditions) are delightfully explored, with no end of guilt and fear.

This homage to life in the Midwest was on target, and, though I'm a goy, the high school bullies, etc., were pretty much the same as I recall. The real story revolves around Michael Stuhlbarg's character, and his issues regarding home, family, job... and the angst that is created when confict arises. Stuhlbarg is nothing short of brilliant in his display of every known emotion,  a multi-layered performance worthy of awards. The whole cast was perfect.

1264805,A1DPP8TXDCHCDN,B002E2M5IC,"R. L. Huff ""An old reader""","[5, 5]","- Might be the subtitle of this film.  The Coen brothers did it again, with another satiric masterpiece whose humor is dark, a virtual fart at a funeral.  No belly laughs, just ironic smiles and uneasy twitters as we watch the physics professor protagonist nail the equations of life on his chalkboard, while his own existence unravels and crumbles in one irrational assault on logic after another.  In an update of Job - without the triumph of faith and goodness - the puzzle cannot resolve itself until he takes action.  And as actions have consequences, the negative action produces the negative result.  Not to make a spoiler, but the cat dies.The layout of the film was a perfect recreation of 1967.  Too ""1967,"" in fact, which the Coen Bros. did purposely to add surreal subtext.

1264806,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002E2M5IC,RMurray847,"[5, 7]","I suspect there is a chance that years from now, when we look back at the careers of the Coen Brothers, A SERIOUS  MAN may be considered to be among their finest work.  This is not to say that it is their most enjoyable movie, but it is a marvel of tone.  It is at once (not alternately) a comedy and a serious meditation on life, morals & ethics.  I frequently found myself laughing out-loud  while at the same time cringing with dismay.  It's an unsettling movie, full of dread...and yet full of joy.  The joy of seeing a film with pitch-perfect performances, great cinematography & art direction and a razor-sharp script.I love the Coens, but even I must admit that some of their comedies are allowed to get flaccid and a little silly.  INTOLERABLE CRUELTY, THE LADYKILLERS and BURN AFTER READING had many joys...but no gravitas.  Remember the ending of THE LADYKILLERS?  It was actually quite bleak, with the crooks of the title failing utterly and in the end, joining a trashheap on a garbage ship.  Yet my feeling at the end was mostly bemusement.  In the Coens more serious work, such as NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, there is frequent comedy playing just below the surface...but it becomes less and less as the film builds to a relentless conclusion.  In BARTON FINK, the comedy gives way to drama and then to sheer, incomprehensible madness that left me, for one, mostly angry that the film had become quite so obtuse.  (Or maybe it was me who became obtuse.)A SERIOUS MAN never stops being funny.  It also ends portentously, but the themes are quite crystal clear up through the final moment.In some ways, we could see this film as a modern-day take on the story of Job.  We meet physics professor Larry Gopnik, just as his tidy, middle-class life begins to fall utterly to pieces.  He earns a modest living that allows him to keep his wife and two older kids in modest comfort in an early example of a subdivision (the film is set in 1967).  The kids are modestly troubled teens, they squabble, take Hebrew school less seriously than it should be...but there isn't anything too outside the range of acceptability.  They are a Jewish family living among gentiles, and this causes some dis-ease...but the Jewish community in their Minnesota town is strong and supportive.  In short, Larry is living a fairly normal life.  He's a meek man, slow to anger and slow to any shows of passion.  He believes there are right ways and wrong ways to do things...but he's always a tiny bit befuddled too.  It may be 1967, but he still seems perhaps a bit stuck in the `50s.One day, a foreign student who is failing his class comes to him and is quite upset about his grades.  When Larry declines to reconsider, he is later delivered a hefty envelope full of cash...a bribe.  While he will not accept the bribe...he doesn't quite give the money back either.  In fact, he firsts throws out the idea of turning the boy in...but the boy threatens to turn HIM in for taking a bribe.  It becomes a hilariously circular argument, and more out of confusion that anything, Larry backs away from making a decision.Then his wife announces she is leaving him.  She has a new man in her life, and she wants Larry to move out.  She's unclear on why this event has taken place...but Larry, ever the meek pussycat, goes along.  Unfortunately, his wife also obliges him to take along his very odd brother Arthur (Richard Kind), a social outcast who clearly suffers from both medical and mental ailments which today we might address, but in 1967, the family simply endures.  So Larry & Arthur live in a horrific motel room together...and Larry's life gets worse from there.  His kids get into trouble.  He comes to fear he may not make tenure.  His money woes increase.  And it gets worse and worse.Larry will eventually be put to severe moral & ethical trials (Job-like again?)...and the film dares to suggest that God is taking a very serious look at Larry's case.  In fact, it's been a long time since a movie looked seriously at the role of religion in the lives of ordinary people who have an ordinary, non-extremist belief in religion.  A belief that embraces the role of religion (in this case, Judiasm) not only in the moral life but in the everyday social life as well.  These folks attend synagogue routinely, and as naturally as they draw breath.  Larry meets all the criteria of what most of us would call a ""good"" person...yet he is put through trials that would break many men.  Will they break him?The movie is nearly perfectly acted.  Stuhlberg should be receiving Oscar buzz...although the movie has underperformed and I doubt he'll be remembered come nominating time.  Yet he is matched by everyone else in the film.  The Coen's are always great at casting folks who LOOK like the character they are playing.  So, even minor roles make an impact...we see the person for 3 seconds in extremely close-up, and we already have a pretty good idea of what kind of person this will be.  The movie, as with all Coen films, looks fabulous.  Art direction and costume direction are flawless and what is remarkable, they are beautiful too, even though all we're seeing is suburban Minnesota in the `60s.  Not exactly a setting most would call breathtaking...and yet it feels rich and complete.As I indicate before, the film does not VEER from funny to serious.  It gives us both at once.  This is a testament to how well all elements were ""playing together.""  The script is revealing and sharp...no wasted words, and I mean that almost literally.  Every sentence uttered has meaning in either revealing character or revealing plot.  And the Coen's know when to let silence do the talking too.  The direction is rock-solid, indicated by the unity of approach that the actors use.  I think the mostly unfamiliar faces in the film allow it to obtain a believability that the casting of a ""star"" might have watered down.  The fact that the Coen's grasped this shows how committed they were to making the BEST film possible, not necessarily the most lucrative.  I've heard that the film is inspired by their own childhoods and the people they knew.  This is necessary to know, but it does help illuminate what I can't help but feel is an extra touch of loving care from these two artists who always lavish their films with so much attention.While this is not a feel-good film by ANY stretch...it left me feeling joyful nonetheless, because it is a great example of film craftsmanship at its finest.  Much to my surprise, this film ranks high among the best of the year.",5,Quietly devastating.  Funny & serious at once.

1264807,A18TLRH5PKAS4S,B002E2M5IC,Rodney Bucket,"[11, 15]","The Coen Brothers have had an unbelievably productive and impressive career thus far: not all of their movies have been superb, to be sure, but they've made an incredible mark on American film-making and have produced multiple films that will no doubt be heralded as classics. And although it did not receive the attention or box-office sales as some of their other works, ""A Serious Man"" is among the Coen's best. It is the best film I saw in 2009, and as far as I'm concerned should be heralded as a new American classic.""A Serious Man"" is an existential drama (with trademark Coen elements of dark humor) whose plot is difficult to describe. Its ties to the Book of Job cannot be ignored, but to say it is simply a retelling of that story is somewhat reductive. It is also a story about religion, certainly, but even that doesn't capture this film's scope. It isn't about Judaism, or Christianity, or any God in particular -- it is about why the things that happen in our life happen, and to what extent we can even know or understand or influence these events. ""A Serious Man"" is about life and its contradictions. Its characters are in an endless state of flux, oscillating between certainty and uncertainty, faith and skepticism, knowledge and ignorance, and even life and death. It is about chaos, fate, inevitability. The protagonist, Larry Gopnik (an incredible Oscar-worthy performance by Michael Stuhlbarg) is a fantastic character study of a tragic hero, and everyman who wants nothing more than to understand others and to be understood himself. He longs to understand his place in the world, in the universe, in God's plan, and is eternally frustrated by his shortsightedness and inability to do so. Why are all of these bad things happening to Larry? Are they consequences of his actions, a punishment from God, or simply bad luck? Does anything we do in this life matter? And what does it mean to be a ""serious"" man, anyway? Larry seeks out the moral guidance of rabbis throughout the film, who seem to be as lost and clueless as he is. Though the rabbis we meet throughout the film are increasingly older and allegedly ""wiser"" (whatever that means), they offer fewer and fewer answers.As is generally the case with the Coens, the film looks beautiful. The cinematography and direction are impeccable, and the plows slowly but meaningfully forward to its brilliant, pitch-perfect climax. The subtle but excellent score by Carter Burwell aids greatly, capturing feelings of longing, confusion, and inevitability which drive the film to its tragic end. All of the acting performances, mostly by essentially unknown players, are superb. I have to give special commendation to Fred Melamed's Sy Ableman, who has to truly be one of the funniest, most whacked character the Coens have imagined (which, given their repertoire of zany personalities, is quite a statement). And the use of Jefferson Airplane's ""Somebody to Love,"" which lyrically and thematically ties in perfectly to the film's themes and ideas is nothing short of inspired.""A Serious Man"" is a film like no other, and is right up there with the Coens' best. In many ways it is their deepest, most mature film, loaded with existential crises and philosophical conundrums. It is a beautiful film to watch, a powerful, moving one to endure, and will leave you thinking about it for a long time to come.

1264808,A27BMC4GBF8RF5,B002E2M5IC,Roger C. Delaney,"[5, 5]","I can't recall such disparate reviews for a film - which is, I suppose, not surprising, given the subject matter and the often-polarizing Coen brothers.  For every film they've made that has received nearly universal acclaim (Fargo, No Country for Old Men, O Brother, Where Art Thou?), they've made one that either inflames or frustrates or just leaves many scratching their heads (Barton Fink, The Hudsucker Proxy, The Big Lebowski - yes, remember this film was panned when it first came out, before it attained its now-legendary cult status).  I wouldn't call this my favorite Coen brothers film by any stretch, but I found it a remarkably well-told, fascinating story, filled with the usual vivid assortment of Coen characters.  For me, whatever flaws it may have are infinitely offset by the wonderfully skewed view of people that the Coens present - no one else makes films like this, and A Serious Man is most certainly cut from the same odd ream of cloth the rest of the Coen milieu comes from.  Just to see Sy tell Larry that he believes it's important at times to count to ten - and then to have Sy literally do that very thing, out loud and then sliently - is, to me, what makes a Coen brothers film so funny and so compelling.  I'd say the same for the scene where the Korean student's dad confronts Larry in his driveway; it's funny because it's uncomfortable and awkward and a trifle disconcerting.  In any case, I would never suggest that this is a film for everyone - the reviews here certainly bear that out.  But I don't understand why some would say it's anti-Semitic, or that you have to be Jewish to relate to it, or that it doesn't tell us anything new about its subject matter.  I think many are simultaneously reading too much and not enough into the film.  And I suspect the Coens are perfectly fine with that, since I doubt seriously they expected this film to be embraced universally.  And I think that's why they make such great films - they make what they want to make, and let the proverbial chips fall where they may.

Everyone has said those famous words "" Why is this happening to me?"" The rabbis do not have the answers at least not good ones. Which explains the serious man's comment ""The boss is still the boss,doesn't make him right."" The answer that is finally given is from a rock song(if you even call it an answer) at the end of the film. I thought the movie was so layered with ambiguities that based on your own belief system you would come away with your own interpretation of  what they were trying to say. You could interpret this man as someone who does not want to cause waves or you could view him trying to be a serious Jewish man and doing what the good book says,""Love your enemy and love those who hurt you,which it seemed his wife and Sy and everyone else was doing. Was the tornado a freak weather storm, did his actions (changing the grade) cause it? So based on what your belief system is, you could say every action has a reaction,or every thing happens for a reason,or things just happen and their is no rhyme or reason why.I viewed the movie as being satire on belief systems. I felt The beginning of the movie was a spring board for the rest of the film. Your personal beliefs could sway your actions. For example the wife thought the man who was invited in her home was an evil spirit or demon. The Husband did not,so he was kind. Her belief system swayed her to stab him. The same thing applied with the serious man and how he dealt with his problems and why they were happening.

1264810,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002E2M5IC,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""A Serious Man"" provides us with a view of 1960s middle class suburbia as only the Coen Brothers, in all their warped glory, could conceive of it.Larry Gopnik is a mild-mannered college professor who lives with his wife and two teenaged children in a spare, homogeneous housing tract, where every home comes replete with its own perfectly manicured lawn and gnarled antennae.  Larry may be leading a life of soul-sucking banality, but it isn't until he discovers that his wife is planning to leave him for a mutual friend of theirs that he begins to question God's purpose for his life.  The Coens deftly satirize the age-old Jewish propensity to heap scorn and guilt upon oneself when things aren't going well in life, and to seek out divine explanations for all one's problems, even with the awareness that such a search will likely lead to more questions than answers in the final analysis.  Larry even has his own King David moment when he espies a neighborhood Bathsheba sunning herself in a nearby yard.  But he's a David who, for all intents and purposes, has no real kingdom to rule over - his wife and kids being, at best, indifferent to his needs and dismissive of his authority - and no special connection to a God who remains stubbornly silent to all Larry`s pleadings for help and understanding.  In fact, the Biblical character he comes most to resemble is Job, as the afflicted man begins to question why, after a lifetime of trying to do the righteous thing, God has suddenly seen fit to rain down all sorts of trials and tribulations onto his increasingly balding head.It makes perfect sense for ""A Serious Man"" to be set in the 1960s, a time when traditionalism and modernity were duking it out for supremacy, even in the drab placidity of a sterile suburb, the last spot on earth one would expect to find such upheaval taking place.  Yet, unlike in urban centers or on college campuses where it was taking place out in the open and in full view of the public, the cultural revolution in suburbia was occurring largely within the nuclear family unit and behind closed doors.  Thus, in ""A Serious Man,"" we have youngsters who study Torah in between smoking pot, listening to Jefferson Airplane on cheap transistor radios, and watching ""F Troop"" reruns on TV, and adults who plan their child's bar mitzvah while partaking in the ""new freedoms"" of divorce, marijuana and extramarital hanky-panky.With its relatively low-wattage drama, austere visuals and trademark inconclusive ending, ""A Serious Man"" is not a sure-fire crowd-pleaser on the order of a ""No Country for Old Men"" or ""Burn Before Reading"" (as much of a crowd-pleaser as any Coen Brothers movie can be, that is), but those with a taste for understated quirkiness should derive a great deal of pleasure from this movie.  Jewish viewers, in particular, may find much to identify with in the knowing satire put forth by the authors.As Larry, Michael Stuhlbarg turns the ultimate nebbish into a perfectly recognizable everyman character.  He receives fine support from the likes of Richard Kind as his troublesome older brother, Sari Lennick as his unfulfilled wife, Aaron Wolff as his socially awkward son, and a whole host of other superb secondary players too numerous to mention.",4,more comic darkness from the masters of the genre,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,3257,"['Serious', 'Man', 'view', '1960s', 'middle', 'class', 'suburbia', 'only', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'warped', 'glory', 'could', 'conceive', 'it.Larry', 'Gopnik', 'mild-mannered', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'wife', 'two', 'teenaged', 'children', 'spare', 'homogeneous', 'housing', 'tract', 'where', 'home', 'replete', 'own', 'perfectly', 'manicured', 'lawn', 'gnarled', 'antennae', 'Larry', 'may', 'be', 'leading', 'life', 'soul-sucking', 'banality', ""n't"", 'wife', 'planning', 'leave', 'mutual', 'friend', 'theirs', 'question', 'God', 'purpose', 'life', 'Coens', 'deftly', 'satirize', 'age-old', 'Jewish', 'propensity', 'heap', 'scorn', 'guilt', 'when', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'well', 'life', 'seek', 'out', 'divine', 'explanations', 'one', 'problems', 'even', 'awareness', 'search', 'will', 'likely', 'lead', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'final', 'analysis', 'Larry', 'even', 'own', 'King', 'David', 'moment', 'when', 'neighborhood', 'Bathsheba', 'sunning', 'nearby', 'yard', 'David', 'who', 'intents', 'purposes', 'real', 'kingdom', 'rule', 'wife', 'kids', 'being', 'best', 'indifferent', 'needs', 'dismissive', 'authority', 'special', 'connection', 'God', 'who', 'stubbornly', 'silent', 'Larry', 's', 'pleadings', 'help', 'understanding', 'fact', 'Biblical', 'character', 'most', 'resemble', 'Job', 'afflicted', 'man', 'question', 'why', 'lifetime', 'trying', 'do', 'righteous', 'thing', 'God', 'suddenly', 'seen', 'fit', 'rain', 'down', 'sorts', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'increasingly', 'balding', 'head.It', 'perfect', 'sense', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'be', 'set', '1960s', 'time', 'when', 'traditionalism', 'modernity', 'were', 'duking', 'out', 'supremacy', 'even', 'drab', 'placidity', 'sterile', 'suburb', 'last', 'spot', 'earth', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'find', 'such', 'upheaval', 'taking', 'place', 'urban', 'centers', 'college', 'campuses', 'where', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'open', 'full', 'view', 'public', 'cultural', 'revolution', 'suburbia', 'was', 'occurring', 'largely', 'nuclear', 'family', 'unit', 'closed', 'doors', 'Thus', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'have', 'youngsters', 'who', 'study', 'Torah', 'smoking', 'pot', 'listening', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'cheap', 'transistor', 'radios', 'watching', 'F', 'Troop', 'reruns', 'TV', 'adults', 'who', 'plan', 'child', 'bar', 'mitzvah', 'partaking', 'new', 'freedoms', 'divorce', 'marijuana', 'extramarital', 'hanky-panky.With', 'relatively', 'low-wattage', 'drama', 'austere', 'visuals', 'trademark', 'inconclusive', 'ending', 'Serious', 'Man', 'not', 'sure-fire', 'crowd-pleaser', 'order', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Burn', 'Reading', 'much', 'crowd-pleaser', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'taste', 'understated', 'quirkiness', 'should', 'derive', 'great', 'deal', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'Jewish', 'viewers', 'particular', 'may', 'find', 'much', 'identify', 'knowing', 'satire', 'put', 'forth', 'authors.As', 'Larry', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'ultimate', 'nebbish', 'perfectly', 'recognizable', 'everyman', 'character', 'fine', 'support', 'likes', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'troublesome', 'older', 'brother', 'Sari', 'Lennick', 'unfulfilled', 'wife', 'Aaron', 'Wolff', 'socially', 'awkward', 'son', 'whole', 'host', 'other', 'superb', 'secondary', 'players', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention']",A Serious Man

1264819,AM4J20OT02THI,B002E2M5IC,Sertorius,"[3, 4]","""The Serious Man"" is the Coen brothers' reflection on the state of modern Judaism, in which the protagonist, a professor of quantum mechanics who lectures incessantly on the Schrodinger's cat paradox and the uncertainty principle, is subjected to a series of Jobian trials.  The film is similar to Archibald Macleish's ""JB"" in this regard, as an atheistic challenge of the Biblical parable, only with a much darker tone.  The story is about the emergence of mid western American Jews from the insulated cloister of the traditional Jewish community, with a stinging rebuke to those traditions, especially to rabbis.  I felt that the movie wove interesting web of subtext, symbolism, and meaning, but crucially, failed to entertain much and is probably only of interest to ""serious"" Jews.The story follows the family of Larry Gopnick(principally himself and his son).  Larry faces a number of life trials.  His wife has fallen for a family friend and asks for a divorce.  He is bribed by a Korean student and his father.  The situation compounds itself, as he is involved in a car wreck and incurs lawyers' fees.  Meanwhile, Larry's 13yo son lethargically attends Hebrew school in preparation for his rite of passage.  He must deal with a school bully and a rabbi who confiscates his transistor radio.Larry, in a state of existential crisis, seeks the spiritual guidance of three successive rabbis.  The first is younger than Larry himself, and seems fixated on the parking lot.  The second is wise and articulate and relates to Larry a parable of the ""Goy's teeth"".  This story within a story was far the most engaging part of the movie.  The story is a conundrum without a solution and offers Larry no direction at all.  Finally, Larry demands audience with the most senior rabbi, the exalted ""Marshak"".  Larry glimpses Marshak, idle within his study like a distant, non-intervening god, but the rabbi refuses to speak with him, claiming to be ""busy"".  Strangely, this was the wisest advice any rabbi could have given to Larry!The point of the three rabbis seems to be the utter bankruptcy of traditional Judaism in solving the problems of the real world.  Indeed, in the opening scene, set in a traditional Polish shtetl, the ancestral home of America's Jews, a Jewish wife stabs a rabbi, thinking him to be an evil spirit, underscoring the film's negative opinion of the traditional religion of Judaism.  When Larry's son approaches the great Marshak during his Bar Mitsvah, the boy observes biological specimens and displays, evocative of Darwinism, and the rationalism of evolutionary science.  Has the greatest religious thinker of all discovered agnosticism as well?  Marshak quotes to the boy the key lines of the movie's theme song, Jefferson Airplane's Want Somebody to Love:  ""When the truth is revealed to be lies, and all the joy within you dies; don't you want somebody to love?"", the ""truth"" in question being the revealed truth of traditional religion.My main purpose in writing this review is to express my opinion of the cryptic final scene, which is generating debate.  At the Hebrew school, a tornado approaches.  While the incompetent rabbi fiddles with the lock to the shelter helpless to solve a real world problem, the children stare into the distance at the approaching cyclone.  The children figuratively stare into the maelstrom of a future of spiritual uncertainty; without the strong, unquestioned beliefs of traditional Judaism to guide them, whither will they bend their steps?The movie offers an interesting window into Jewish society, but as I mentioned earlier fails to create an enjoyable story somehow.  The writers appear to have been too preoccupied with creating a hyper-symbolic hyper-artistic riddle of a movie, rather than a living piece of cinematic art.  The film might be more like a Talmud on a biblical story, rather than simply the story in its wild beauty.  Moreover, the Coens present a savagely stereotyped portrayal of a non-Jewish, middle American family in the form of the Gopnik's neighbors, a hunter and his small son.

I want to assure you that is NOT a reason NOT to see the film. I think one universal truth about humans is that, regardless of our individual religious affiliations, we all seek deeper meaning to our lives, past paying our mortgage and taxes... The various rabbis the hero seeks out in order to help him make sense of his trials and tribulations may as well be imams or catholic priests. Larry's quest for the meaning to his suffering is akin to what most of us go thru at some point... All of which makes him a sympathetic character. The story, as told by the brothers Coen, is witty and engaging; the lessons are true and wise. Be ready for little action, a few contemplative chuckles, and a lot of food for thought. This is definitely a film best appreciated when one is in a ruminative mood. However, the lessons could as well be told in three sentences or less, rather then an hour and twenty five minutes of film.

If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. - Jesus ChristThere are two ways to be a serious man in the manner in which the term is understood in this movie. One way is to be recognized by society as the kind of man who can reward his friends and punish his enemies, a man of consequence, a man to be taken seriously. The other way is to be in full possession of your soul. The eponymous hero of this movie, Larry Gopnik (a physics professor played with great skill by Michael Stuhlbarg) is of the second type. To the eyes of the world, he is a timid man of little consequence. But God, who sees all things, knows otherwise and sends him sorrows so that his soul might bear fruit.His wife leaves him for another man who, while pretending to be his friend, is secretly conspiring to get Larry denied tenure at his college. One of his students tries to bribe him into giving him a passing grade and when Larry refuses, threatens a lawsuit. His troglodyte neighbor bullies him. His teenage children, being teenage children, can see his predicament and yet are too wrapped up in their own petty concerns to give him the affection and companionship he needs. In desperation, Larry seeks out, in succession, the advise of three Rabbais. The first two try their best to help. The last, the wise Marshak who understands what is going on, offers silence.What does Larry do? Instead of striking back, he simply absorbs the insults and cruelty. When his wife and her lover suggest he move out of his own house to a seedy motel, he quietly complies. He carries on with each situation by ascertaining the most civil, the most considerate response until, at the end of the film, things turn around and each burden resolves to a tolerably good conclusion, seemingly by itself. Mysteriously, God laid these burdens on Larry and, just as mysteriously, He lifted them. It was all for a purpose. The burdens could have been born with such grace only by a serious man.

They are cosy with each other,co-directing their films,creating ambience on their sets.They followed No Country For Old Men, a commercial,critical success,with this return to their Minnesotan mid-western roots.They want to show us the 60s,Jimmy Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane,but through a brown filter, that of  a Jewish family that are undergoing tribulations,loosely based on the Old Testament Book of Job.Their prologue of the dybbuk in the shetl laid down the tone, the idea of the curse.The film depicted a traditional Jewish family in a deadpan, laidback, dry- bone way.The central character,physics professor Larry Gopnik(Stuhlbarg),is passive,decent, put-upon man,husband, father, brother,teaching physics(Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle,Schrodinger's cat),filling boards with equations,but can't understand his life.He is being bribed by a Korean student to upgrade him in maths, who understands the stories not the math.,he's also suing him.His wife,the dominant partner wants a divorce to marry his best friend, Sy.He is coming up for tenure and poison letters are being sent to the University committee about him.His brother ,socially inept and involved with the Kaballah and gambling,lives with him.

1264825,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B002E2M5IC,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[3, 3]","""A Serious Man""  is an original.  Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen (""No Country for Old Men""), the film focuses on an Everyman named Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor at a Midwestern university where he will soon learn if he will receive tenure.  The year is 1967, and Larry is in for some unexpected troubles.  His wife (Sari Lennick) is leaving him for best friend Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed).  His unemployed brother (Richard Kind) is becoming more and more of a burden.  His son, Danny (Aaron Wolff), is secretly listening to rock music at Hebrew school rather than learning the Torah.  The alluring woman next door sunbathes nude.  Larry elicits sympathy because he is a decent guy bombarded by a series of incidents that lead him to wonder why God has singled him out for ""tsouris.""  Distraught, he consults three different rabbis, who lead him on a convoluted journey as he struggles to make sense of it all.There are many Coen trademarks here:  emphasis on the grotesque, dry humor, ominous low-angle cinematography, situations bordering on the surreal, and bizarre dream/nightmare sequences.  The Coens tell their story episodically, offering perhaps a few too many tangential subplots.  When we think we've latched onto the main thread, focus shifts, and then shifts again.  The film is like a homemade chicken soup where the individual ingredients haven't quite blended.Performances are uniformly low-key as characters create comedy in subtle ways.  There are no jokes, but we laugh at the earnest characters, the absurd situations, and the skewering of established religion.  ""A Serious Man"" is the anti-sitcom.  It showcases a family with its warts and flaws right out front.  Ozzie and Harriet never worried about the meaning of life or why a dark cloud settled over the family.  The Coens revel in dissecting Larry's angst as we watch his awkward, humorous missteps through life, relationships, and morality.  The ending is rather abrupt, and might require a replay to understand how everything comes together.Blu-ray and DVD extras include the featurettes ""Becoming Serious,"" which explores the creative vision behind ""A Serious Man;"" ""Creating 1967,"" a tour of the Minneapolis neighborhoods used in the movie; and ""Hebrew and Yiddish for Goys,"" a guide through the mysteries of the Hebrew and Yiddish languages.",3,Trials & Tribulations of an Everyman,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,2345,"['Serious', 'Man', 'original', 'Directed', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'film', 'Everyman', 'named', 'Larry', 'Gopnik', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'physics', 'professor', 'Midwestern', 'university', 'where', 'will', 'soon', 'learn', 'will', 'receive', 'tenure', 'year', '1967', 'Larry', 'unexpected', 'troubles', 'wife', 'Sari', 'Lennick', 'leaving', 'best', 'friend', 'Sy', 'Ableman', 'Fred', 'Melamed', 'unemployed', 'brother', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'burden', 'son', 'Danny', 'Aaron', 'Wolff', 'secretly', 'listening', 'rock', 'music', 'Hebrew', 'school', 'rather', 'learning', 'Torah', 'alluring', 'woman', 'next', 'door', 'sunbathes', 'nude', 'Larry', 'sympathy', 'decent', 'guy', 'bombarded', 'series', 'incidents', 'lead', 'wonder', 'why', 'God', 'singled', 'out', 'tsouris', 'Distraught', 'consults', 'three', 'different', 'rabbis', 'who', 'lead', 'convoluted', 'journey', 'make', 'sense', 'are', 'many', 'Coen', 'trademarks', 'here', 'emphasis', 'grotesque', 'dry', 'humor', 'ominous', 'low-angle', 'cinematography', 'situations', 'bordering', 'surreal', 'bizarre', 'dream/nightmare', 'sequences', 'Coens', 'tell', 'story', 'episodically', 'offering', 'perhaps', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'tangential', 'subplots', 'When', 'think', ""'ve"", 'latched', 'main', 'thread', 'focus', 'shifts', 'then', 'shifts', 'again', 'film', 'homemade', 'chicken', 'soup', 'where', 'individual', 'ingredients', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'blended.Performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'low-key', 'characters', 'create', 'comedy', 'subtle', 'ways', 'are', 'jokes', 'laugh', 'earnest', 'characters', 'absurd', 'situations', 'skewering', 'established', 'religion', 'Serious', 'Man', 'anti-sitcom', 'family', 'warts', 'flaws', 'right', 'out', 'front', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'never', 'worried', 'meaning', 'life', 'why', 'dark', 'cloud', 'settled', 'family', 'Coens', 'revel', 'dissecting', 'Larry', 'angst', 'watch', 'awkward', 'humorous', 'missteps', 'life', 'relationships', 'morality', 'ending', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'might', 'require', 'replay', 'understand', 'how', 'everything', 'together.Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'featurettes', 'Becoming', 'Serious', 'creative', 'vision', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'Creating', '1967', 'tour', 'Minneapolis', 'neighborhoods', 'used', 'movie', 'Hebrew', 'Yiddish', 'Goys', 'guide', 'mysteries', 'Hebrew', 'Yiddish', 'languages']",A Serious Man

The ""golem"" metaphor at the beginning of the movie is a reflection of Judaism itself. I say this as a Jew who has lived in Israel.The main character's  pathetic nature is reinforced by all the worst in modern-day Judaism. This pathetic reflection of a man out-of-touch with himself, wife and kids, remains a harsh reflection of much of Western Culture, stripping bare of what in reality it means to 'yield-to-be-good' in a post-diaspora world.It is a rare movie that I finish and think to watch again very soon. There is so much power in the exploration of this weak, browbeaten man. I enjoyed the fact that he could appear to be more-than adequate at work, but a total wimp with wife, and stand helplessly cuckolded, even allowing the adulterer to dictate terms to him, and have him move to a motel as the wife's lover prepares to take over the man's wife, home and family.The bribe business is merely the last piece of himself that he surrenders. He's already surrendered manhood and fatherhood, now he surrenders his integrity, honesty and professionalism even as he gets what he's seeking. The complexity of the summation is only made more beautiful as he gets the medical ""bad news,"" and the tornado is artistic perfection.It really is a bare-knuckle indictment of modern man as well as Judaism, within its stripping bare of the nonsense and almost paganistic ritualism of chanting irrelevent Hebrew, the glowing parents and his lawyers/co-workers' glowing-reviews of the stoned 13 year-old all combined to make a point brilliantly.I think in this post diasporic END TIMES, a film like this is a jewel. The dream sequences with the canoe and his brother were phenomenal. The sexy neighbor sequences were great, as you wonder if she will make a man out of him, sort of she's gonna 'save' him type thing with sex and marijuana, and when he suddenly wakes up in that motel room, you feel like it's YOU who have been dropped out of that exciting dream yourself.Just a great piece of work; brilliantly ending with the approach of apocalypse, which is what this kind of man, replicated by the tens of millions amongst us today, will bring to humanity to hasten its doom.",5,Bare-knuckles Jewel,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,2229,"['movie', 'well', 'Obituary', 'American', 'Judaism', 'golem', 'metaphor', 'beginning', 'movie', 'reflection', 'Judaism', 'say', 'Jew', 'who', 'lived', 'Israel.The', 'main', 'character', 'pathetic', 'nature', 'reinforced', 'worst', 'modern-day', 'Judaism', 'pathetic', 'reflection', 'man', 'out-of-touch', 'wife', 'kids', 'harsh', 'reflection', 'much', 'Western', 'Culture', 'stripping', 'bare', 'what', 'reality', ""'yield-to-be-good"", 'post-diaspora', 'world.It', 'rare', 'movie', 'finish', 'think', 'watch', 'again', 'very', 'soon', 'so', 'much', 'power', 'exploration', 'weak', 'browbeaten', 'man', 'enjoyed', 'fact', 'could', 'appear', 'be', 'more-than', 'adequate', 'work', 'total', 'wimp', 'wife', 'stand', 'helplessly', 'cuckolded', 'even', 'allowing', 'adulterer', 'dictate', 'terms', 'have', 'move', 'motel', 'wife', 'lover', 'take', 'over', 'man', 'wife', 'home', 'family.The', 'bribe', 'business', 'merely', 'last', 'piece', 'already', 'surrendered', 'manhood', 'fatherhood', 'now', 'integrity', 'honesty', 'professionalism', 'even', 'what', 'seeking', 'complexity', 'summation', 'only', 'made', 'more', 'beautiful', 'medical', 'bad', 'news', 'tornado', 'artistic', 'perfection.It', 'really', 'bare-knuckle', 'indictment', 'modern', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'Judaism', 'stripping', 'bare', 'nonsense', 'almost', 'paganistic', 'ritualism', 'chanting', 'irrelevent', 'Hebrew', 'glowing', 'parents', 'lawyers/co-workers', 'glowing-reviews', 'stoned', '13', 'year-old', 'combined', 'make', 'point', 'brilliantly.I', 'think', 'post', 'diasporic', 'END', 'TIMES', 'film', 'jewel', 'dream', 'canoe', 'brother', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'sexy', 'neighbor', 'sequences', 'were', 'great', 'wonder', 'will', 'make', 'man', 'sort', 'gon', ""'save"", 'type', 'thing', 'sex', 'marijuana', 'when', 'suddenly', 'up', 'motel', 'room', 'feel', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'dropped', 'exciting', 'dream', 'yourself.Just', 'great', 'piece', 'work', 'brilliantly', 'ending', 'approach', 'apocalypse', 'what', 'kind', 'man', 'replicated', 'tens', 'millions', 'amongst', 'today', 'will', 'bring', 'humanity', 'hasten', 'doom']",A Serious Man

A man comes home and informs his wife that he met an old man in the street who the wife insists died three years ago. Suddenly, there's a knock on the door and the old man is welcomed in by the husband. The wife, however, is convinced that the man is an evil spirit and plunges a knife into his chest. The old man gets up and states he realizes he's not welcome in the home and walks out the door. The folktale serves as an introduction to both the internal and external arc of the story. In both cases, 'tsuris' (a Yiddish word which means troubles) comes to the film's main character, Larry Gopnik, and members of the conservative Jewish community he's part of.Larry is a physics professor at a local college in the Midwest. He lives with his wife, son and daughter and an oddball uncle who at first seems a bit eccentric but later turns out to be completely dysfunctional. We soon realize that Larry is the embodiment of a modern-day 'Job', illustrating the old adage, 'sometimes bad things happen to good people'. The 'bad things' include one of Larry's Korean students who tries to bribe him with a large amount of cash, hoping that he'll change his grade. The student's father later threatens Larry with a lawsuit for defamation.Things begin falling apart completely for Larry when his wife announces that she's leaving him for the vapid Sy Ableman, an aging widower who hugs everybody who he comes in contact with. Since Larry is such a pushover, he agrees to Sy and his wife's demand that he move out of the family house and into a local motel. Things get worse when Uncle Arthur is arrested for gambling and later for sodomy. Larry ends up compromising his principles by pocketing the Korean student's bribe money and changing his grade in order to pay a rich lawyer to defend his dysfunctional uncle. Larry is also up for tenure at the college but one of his colleagues on the tenure committee tells him that someone has been sending letters to the committee, impugning his character. After Sy is killed in a car crash, Larry finds out (inadvertently through his wife) that it was Sy who bad-mouthed him to the committee.Things seem as though they're about to turn for the good for our modern day Job: Son Danny manages to do well at his Bar Mitzvah and Larry finds out that he's on track to get tenure. But at the last minute, Larry gets a call from his physician who wants him to come in immediately and discuss test results--although we don't see the scene with Larry meeting his doctor, the implication is that Larry is about to receive a cancer diagnosis.The Coen Brothers know how to tell a good story but they have created a group of caricatures, sort of a 'hate letter' to the conservative Jewish community they grew up in. The passive schlep Larry is the only sympathetic character in their entire narrative. Otherwise, every other character (and most of them are Jewish) are either nasty or ineffectual. It's one thing to ridicule a group of people, pointing out their shortcomings--but it must be done with affection and not contempt. Here, the Coen Brothers are always looking at their fellow Jews as if the glass was half empty and never half full.As Larry's life spirals out of control, his quest for guidance from members of his community falls on deaf ears. The Coens ridicule the community by showing how Larry receives useless advice from a succession of two Rabbis he visits. The first one is a Junior Rabbi who ultimately suggests that Larry passively accept whatever happens to him since we can never know what God has planned for us. The second, Nachtner, an older Rabbi, provides even more useless advice in the form of a parable about an orthodontist who discovers cryptic letters on a Goy's (non-Jew's) teeth. Larry is exasperated when there is no moral to the story and the Rabbi seems to enjoy reciting the tale simply for its own sake.Finally, there's a third Rabbi, Marshak, who appears extremely old and feeble. He declines to see Larry but later his son Danny has an obligatory meeting with him after his Bar Mitzvah. Rabbi Marshak had pocketed the transistor radio given to him by a Hebrew School teacher who earlier had confiscated it from Danny who was listening to the radio and not paying attention to anything said in class. The senile Marshak obviously had been listening to the radio earlier and recites a list of popular rock groups (including Jefferson Airplane) before handing the radio back to Danny.Whereas the member of the community are ineffectual, Larry's family members are a nasty bunch. In addition to his adulterous wife Judith, Larry's daughter Sarah filches money from him to pay for a nose job. Then there's Danny who's addicted to watching 'F Troop' on TV and who must always avoid the neighbor down the street, a youth he too has filched money from. The aforementioned Uncle Arthur won't get a job and ends up in handcuffs for molestation.As someone who was Bar Mitzvahed in 1966, a year before this story takes place, I well remember my own contempt for some of the rituals and convictions of my co-religionists. But as I grew older, I realized that everyone has their good points and bad. Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers smugly stand above the fray and delude themselves into believing that they're enlightening their audience. In actuality, the Coens remain in an earlier arrested period of development and provide an inaccurate view of the conservative Jewish community they're commenting on.",2,Coen Brothers' contempt for

A Serious Man is a twisty and quirky drama about a Minnesotan-Jewish professor who sees his life spiral down with his son, family, and encounters.Larry Gopnik is our observer and victim of what goes and will go wrong and the film takes an often omnipresent and very philosophical nature of mental breakdowns intertwined with the complexities of one's relationship to their faith or religion. A purely Jewish film at heart that manages to take much of the tales (like in the beginning between the dybbuk and an emotionally-strung couple) and conversations about the work of Hashem and of the Torah; henceforth, there are not many like it out there.While a lot is to be questioned about through its consistent metaphors is a good thing, the whole mood and feel of the film is quite difficult to pin-point out given its social-religious commentary, themes, and sparing environment where some characters appear and that is it (Ms. Samsky, Danny and Sarah Gopnik) and some scenes are just left to the imagination a bit too much. The Coens, as always, do employ their signature dark humour in the film by focusing on ironic situations through scenes that involve a confrontation, a fight, and a discussion of life.This film is more held in its place and less overrated than No Country for Old Men but still suffers from perceivable aspects of plot and characterisation because of the philosophy behind its film's ready-for-discussion-at-the-end vibe.""",3,"Complex, metaphor-driven story about religion and emotions makes for intelligent viewing at best.",1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,1603,"['Demanding', 'many', 'parts', 'say', 'least', 'least', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'seen', 'Creating', '1967', 'Hebrew', 'Yiddish', 'Goyim', 'features', 'DVD', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'twisty', 'quirky', 'drama', 'Minnesotan-Jewish', 'professor', 'who', 'life', 'spiral', 'down', 'son', 'family', 'encounters.Larry', 'Gopnik', 'observer', 'victim', 'what', 'will', 'go', 'wrong', 'film', 'often', 'omnipresent', 'very', 'philosophical', 'nature', 'mental', 'breakdowns', 'intertwined', 'complexities', 'one', 'relationship', 'faith', 'religion', 'purely', 'Jewish', 'film', 'heart', 'take', 'much', 'tales', 'beginning', 'dybbuk', 'emotionally-strung', 'couple', 'conversations', 'work', 'Hashem', 'Torah', 'henceforth', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'out', 'lot', 'be', 'questioned', 'consistent', 'metaphors', 'good', 'thing', 'whole', 'mood', 'feel', 'film', 'quite', 'difficult', 'pin-point', 'out', 'given', 'social-religious', 'commentary', 'themes', 'sparing', 'environment', 'where', 'characters', 'appear', 'Ms.', 'Samsky', 'Danny', 'Sarah', 'Gopnik', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'left', 'imagination', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Coens', 'always', 'do', 'employ', 'signature', 'dark', 'humour', 'film', 'focusing', 'ironic', 'situations', 'scenes', 'involve', 'confrontation', 'fight', 'discussion', 'life.This', 'film', 'more', 'held', 'place', 'less', 'overrated', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'still', 'suffers', 'perceivable', 'aspects', 'plot', 'characterisation', 'philosophy', 'film', 'ready-for-discussion-at-the-end', 'vibe']",A Serious Man

By the Coens' own admission in one of the bonus features, it does not have a plot.  Neither does it have a resolution.  But that's what life is like for Larry Gopnik and for many of the rest of us as well, right?Spoilers ...............................Larry is beset on all sides by a sexy neighbor, a wife who is cheating on him, a daughter who takes his money to save for a nose job, a son who is getting high on pot in Hebrew school, a tenure committee that is accepting negative letters written about him, a student who tries to blackmail him regarding a grade, a Columbia Record house salesman who wants money for records Larry never requested, etc.  Larry tries to talk to others about all this, especially rabbis, but nobody has a real answer for why he is suffering.  In this sense, he reminds me of Job in the Bible.  There is no tidy wrap-up at the end, only the promise of a tornado and very possibly some bad medical news for Larry.This is an existentialist film for sure.  It requires concentration and thought, and it's definitely not a sitcom or some silly comedy that goes for an easy joke.  It's no wonder that few theatres carried it and few people saw it on the big screen.  But I think it plays even better on the small screen, since it is not carried out on some epic style.Coen fans will also appreciate the brothers' attention to detail, especially the 1967 Minnesota setting.  They talk about this in the bonus features, which are helpful to watch before seeing the film.  It also helps to check out the Hebrew translation feature so you know what people are saying, since not all of it is subtitled.",5,Existentialism.

1264833,A366K6G0ISLX7Q,B002E2M5IC,vs,"[10, 26]","I'm not a huge fan of Coen Brothers' movies, but sometimes I just want to catch up on what's going on in American cinema nowadays. Being beyond the pale for Avatar, I go for ""Burn After Reading"" and ""A Serious Man"".I can find some excuse for rehashing old Graham Greene novels in ""Burn After Reading"", this excuse being - absolutely no pretensions. Also - pretty good satire (both Linda Litzke & Chad Feldheimer are very funny and easily recognizable types). Finally - star performance of John Malkovich, Frances McDormand and yes - even Brad Pitt!. That being said I'd have given this movie 4 stars in its genre of (almost) mindless and second-hand comedy.Now to ""A Serious Man"". This movie is clearly an indication that anything goes in American cinema today. Ron ""true faith"" in his comment here (also one star rating) with a title ""Nothing new under the sun"" says that ""A Serious Man"" is a ""film that gives arthouse cinema a bad name"". Come on, Ron, how can you even mention arthouse here when talking about this movie.Coens start with a short flashback to 18th century Europe where they show a Jewish family encounter with a so-called ""undead"" dybbuk, ""a malicious possessing spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person"". The viewer's supposed to make connections between this encounter and bad luck of a Jewish physics professor in the second half of XX century.This bad luck being: a wife who wants a divorce (to get married to a professor's old friend), a 13-year-old son smoking pot, car accidents, students who pressure him to accept bribes in exchange for good grades, etc, etc - and finally some bad news about recent X-ray examination. The problem with all this is that it was said and filmed countless number of times, from Philip Roth to Joseph Heller including all this Jewish family athmosphere, for which one is advised to go no further than Curb Your Enthusiasm. After Larry David one needs to add something really significant to the subject if one desires not to be completely discounted.No pop-philosophy including biblical references to the story of Job or whatever else would help, because the film is absolutely pointless and senseless. Another good example - gentile neighbours and Korean student with this bribe story. Why all that? What's the point? Why Korean? Can somebody explain please? The scene with the first (young) rabbi is the only one really worth watching, but is it enough for the full length movie?When one's reading Portnoy's Complaint - everything's to the point, beacuse the book is really groundbreaking. To an extent this can be said about American Pastoral, or Something Happened. But after the string of movies like ""About Shmitd"", ""The Truman Show"", and other ""deep psychological/philosophical/existential"" flicks ""A Serious Man"" leaves one with a strong resolution not to touch anything produced by Coen Brothers ever again.",1,Pointless rehash of everything and anything.,1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,2890,"[""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'just', 'want', 'catch', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'American', 'cinema', 'nowadays', 'Being', 'pale', 'Avatar', 'go', 'Burn', 'Reading', 'Serious', 'Man', 'can', 'find', 'excuse', 'rehashing', 'old', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'novels', 'Burn', 'Reading', 'excuse', 'being', 'absolutely', 'pretensions', 'Also', 'pretty', 'good', 'satire', 'Linda', 'Litzke', 'Chad', 'Feldheimer', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'types', 'Finally', 'star', 'performance', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'yes', 'even', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'being', 'said', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'genre', 'almost', 'mindless', 'second-hand', 'comedy.Now', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'movie', 'clearly', 'indication', 'anything', 'American', 'cinema', 'today', 'Ron', 'true', 'faith', 'comment', 'here', 'also', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'title', 'Nothing', 'new', 'sun', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'film', 'arthouse', 'cinema', 'bad', 'name', 'Come', 'Ron', 'how', 'can', 'even', 'mention', 'arthouse', 'here', 'when', 'talking', 'movie.Coens', 'start', 'short', 'flashback', '18th', 'century', 'Europe', 'where', 'show', 'Jewish', 'family', 'encounter', 'so-called', 'undead', 'dybbuk', 'malicious', 'possessing', 'spirit', 'believed', 'be', 'dislocated', 'soul', 'dead', 'person', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'make', 'connections', 'encounter', 'bad', 'luck', 'Jewish', 'physics', 'professor', 'second', 'half', 'XX', 'century.This', 'bad', 'luck', 'being', 'wife', 'who', 'divorce', 'get', 'married', 'professor', 'old', 'friend', '13-year-old', 'son', 'smoking', 'pot', 'car', 'accidents', 'students', 'who', 'pressure', 'accept', 'bribes', 'exchange', 'good', 'grades', 'etc', 'etc', 'finally', 'bad', 'news', 'recent', 'X-ray', 'examination', 'problem', 'was', 'said', 'filmed', 'countless', 'number', 'times', 'Philip', 'Roth', 'Joseph', 'Heller', 'including', 'Jewish', 'family', 'athmosphere', 'one', 'advised', 'go', 'further', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'Larry', 'David', 'one', 'add', 'something', 'really', 'significant', 'subject', 'one', 'not', 'be', 'completely', 'discounted.No', 'pop-philosophy', 'including', 'biblical', 'references', 'story', 'Job', 'else', 'would', 'help', 'film', 'absolutely', 'pointless', 'senseless', 'good', 'example', 'gentile', 'neighbours', 'Korean', 'student', 'bribe', 'story', 'Why', 'What', 'point', 'Why', 'Korean', 'Can', 'somebody', 'explain', 'please', 'scene', 'first', 'young', 'rabbi', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'enough', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'When', 'one', 'reading', 'Portnoy', 'Complaint', 'everything', 'point', 'book', 'really', 'groundbreaking', 'extent', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'American', 'Pastoral', 'Something', 'Happened', 'string', 'movies', 'Shmitd', 'Truman', 'Show', 'other', 'deep', 'psychological/philosophical/existential', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', 'one', 'strong', 'resolution', 'not', 'touch', 'anything', 'produced', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'ever', 'again']",A Serious Man
