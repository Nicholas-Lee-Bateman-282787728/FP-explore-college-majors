However, in Moon Machines, we get the other angle from the engineers that built the machines.On a single DVD there are six episodes, each about forty-five minutes long, covering a certain aspect of the Apollo program. These are:-The Saturn V rocket-The Command Module-The Navigation Computer-The Lunar Module-The Spacesuit-The Lunar RoverEach episode contains interviews from many engineers that worked first-hand on the equipment. They tell the most fascinating stories that accompanied the development of these machines. Also included is a ton of behind-the-scenes footage showing how equipment was initially developed and tested on here on Earth.I would highly recommend this DVD for those interested in the Apollo program and spaceflight.",5,Wonderful Apollo Documentaries,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,894,"['When', 'story', 'Apollo', 'usually', 'told', 'documentary', 'format', 'usually', 'astronauts', 'working', 'Mission', 'Control', 'However', 'Moon', 'Machines', 'get', 'other', 'angle', 'engineers', 'built', 'machines.On', 'single', 'DVD', 'are', 'six', 'episodes', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'long', 'covering', 'certain', 'aspect', 'Apollo', 'program', 'are', '-The', 'Saturn', 'V', 'rocket-The', 'Command', 'Module-The', 'Navigation', 'Computer-The', 'Lunar', 'Module-The', 'Spacesuit-The', 'Lunar', 'RoverEach', 'episode', 'interviews', 'many', 'engineers', 'worked', 'first-hand', 'equipment', 'tell', 'most', 'fascinating', 'stories', 'accompanied', 'development', 'machines', 'Also', 'included', 'ton', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'showing', 'how', 'equipment', 'was', 'initially', 'developed', 'tested', 'here', 'Earth.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'interested', 'Apollo', 'program', 'spaceflight']",Moon Machines

1251573,AQKLGDNJJAFPK,B0026IQTR2,dj,"[1, 1]","There are a lot of videos on project Apollo which range from documentary (like Discovery Channel's ""When We Left Earth""), historical docu-drama  (like HBO's ""From the Earth to the Moon""), to the technical, like anything published by Spacecraft Films. Most of these other videos casually brush past the development of the spacecraft involved in the missions, focusing instead on the pilots and ground crews involved with the immediate task of flying these missions (""From the Earth to the Moon"" does a fine introductory job at presenting some of the development phases, but docu-dramas are just that: not actual history). But what Science Magazine has done with this DVD set is nothing short of brilliant: to provide the viewer with the technological obstacles required to fulfill project Apollo's mission objectives.This four hour DVD set is broken down into 45 minute segments, focusing on the development of the Saturn V rocket, the space suit, the lunar roving vehicle, the lunar module, the command/service modules, etc. With each episode, the producers tracked down key personnel who aided in the design, development, and testing of these machines. The interview style of filming is top notch, and reminds me of the quality Ron Howard employed in interviewing the astronauts for the program ""In the Shadow of the Moon."" Hearing the first-hand account of how many of these marvelous inventions came to life is engaging, and at times, jaw-dropping. I was specifically impressed with the development of the spacesuit, especially the care taken in developing custom-fit gloves for each and every astronaut - gloves which had to allow the astronaut enough dexterity to be able to pick up a dime on a slippery floor, but also remain pressurized within the vacuum of space. The number and variety of space suits that were designed and tested was also new to me. ILC Dover company, who finally won the contract, even sent NASA a film of their test engineer playing football in an Apollo spacesuit prototype!This DVD is not just interviews with the developers of these machines. The real gem here is the careful selection and presentation of rarely seen testing and development film footage. I was impressed with how much material was dug up for these segments. I also watched the whole video in one sitting the first time through. Very engaging!If you're looking for an excellent companion to this video in book form, I highly recommend W.

No astronauts, grizzled flight controllers or pundits here, this series highlights the engineers who sweated the details.  Old men now, they look back fondly on an adventure to which they devoted large parts of their lives - with pride, awe, and occasional sadness, especially when they talk about the Apollo 1 fire.  Rather than make this a fast-paced, slam-bang effort, the film makers will linger on the face of an interviewee after he finishes a sentence, catching a raised eyebrow or a frown, speaking far more than words themselves.  As a space enthusiast, I also appreciated the wealth of behind-the-scenes footage unearthed, and how it's not simply used as generic ""b-roll"" as other producers have done, i.e. showing the wrong type of rocket during liftoffs or using footage shot out the command module window during re-entry to ""illustrate"" the Apollo 1 fire.Could we go to the moon today?

Pretty detailed for something I still see people online claim was a hoax. The evolution, construction and use of the Command Module, Saturn V booster, LEM/LM, etc., was an amazing feat of engineering. The lesson being that if we focus on a specific engineering problem, put enough funding and brain power into solving it the American people can do just about anything. Maybe this is why such massive projects like Apollo are rare.

Over the years there has been a lot of programs put together to try to give people an idea of what was involved in getting men to the moon.I've seen most of those and enjoyed them. But they all pale in comparison to this great series of programs that breaks the work toward the launch of Apollo's 11-17.The effort is broken down into six episodes that go into detail not yet seen in shows covering the Apollo and Saturn program.They have tracked down many living engineers who worked on several different systems within the program. One of these engineers was 93 when this was made; and his pride was still palpable. They did something that made these men more real by showing pictures of them as they were then; it added to their humanity, at least for me.Details are covered here that haven't been mentioned anywhere else.This is an excellent program for almost anyone; it moves along nicely, has interesting people, and is put together in way that should ""grab"" just about anyone.Two thumbs and two great toes way up!",5,Fantastic,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,1074,"['best', 'video', 'presentation', 'yet', 'done', 'subject', 'years', 'there', 'been', 'lot', 'programs', 'put', 'together', 'try', 'give', 'people', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'involved', 'getting', 'men', 'moon.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'pale', 'comparison', 'great', 'series', 'programs', 'breaks', 'work', 'launch', 'Apollo', '11-17.The', 'effort', 'broken', 'down', 'six', 'episodes', 'go', 'detail', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'shows', 'covering', 'Apollo', 'Saturn', 'program.They', 'have', 'tracked', 'down', 'many', 'living', 'engineers', 'who', 'worked', 'several', 'different', 'systems', 'program', 'One', 'engineers', 'was', '93', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'pride', 'was', 'still', 'palpable', 'did', 'something', 'made', 'men', 'more', 'real', 'showing', 'pictures', 'were', 'then', 'added', 'humanity', 'least', 'me.Details', 'are', 'covered', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'mentioned', 'anywhere', 'else.This', 'excellent', 'program', 'almost', 'anyone', 'along', 'nicely', 'interesting', 'people', 'put', 'together', 'way', 'should', 'grab', 'just', 'anyone.Two', 'thumbs', 'two', 'great', 'toes', 'way']",Moon Machines

1251591,A2OPBCF28QTARX,B0026IQTR2,Stewart Teaze - Global Warming Debunker; Kidd...,"[5, 5]","Six-part documentary on six of the systems that were part of the Apollo Moon Project:1) Saturn V Rocket2) Command Module3) Navigation Computer4) Lunar Lander5) Space Suit6) Lunar RoverEach episode contains commentaries by a dozen or so of the original Engineers/Managers/Technicians who worked on the specific systems, interspersed with videos relevant to the commentaries.  Each episode captures at least 2 or 3 of the ""problems"" that had to be overcome to develop each of these critical systems, and captures the ""most critical"" and ""high point"" of the Apollo Mission, from the perspective of those who worked on the individual systems.I watch these documentaries over and over... the Saturn V episode is my favorite.It is my opinion that the way in which the Lunar Lander episode depicts that Von Braun ""finally came around to accept"" Houbolt's Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) was the ""only way"" to get the moon (within the 10 year goal set by Kennedy) is over-simplified & misleading, and really misses the facts in a number of ways... to see for yourself, one can read an account of Von Braun's own opinion on this subject, in an online article that contains two interviews with Dr. Von Braun (conducted August 25, 1970, and November 17, 1971); in which Von Braun clearly corrects the record on this subject... so, that Robert Seamans & this documentary (made in 2008/2009) would take - in my opinion - an unfair and outdated representation of the situation, apparently cooked up by the press in the late 60's for its ""sensationalist"" angle, is a bit misleading on this important/main historical subject from that particular episode.For example:Sample Excerpt from Interview #1:In the Apollo Spacecraft Chronology, you are quoted as saying ""It is true that for a long time we were not in favor of lunar orbit rendezvous. We favored Earth orbit rendezvous.""Von Braun:Well, actually even that is not quite correct, because at the outset we just didn't know which route [for Apollo to travel to the Moon] was the most promising. We made an agreement with Houston that we at Marshall would concentrate on the study of Earth orbit rendezvous, but that did not mean we wanted to sell it as our preferred scheme. We weren't ready to vote for it yet; our study was meant to merely identify the problems involved. The agreement also said that Houston would concentrate on studying the lunar rendezvous mode. Only after both groups had done their homework would we compare notes. This agreement was based on common sense. You don't start selling your scheme until you are convinced that it is superior. At the outset, neither Houston nor Marshall knew what was the best approach. And the fact that Houston happened to study the lunar orbit rendezvous mode was purely coincidental. That mode didn't even originate in Houston-it was first proposed by John Houbolt of the Langley Center. The problem with Houbolt's original study was that his weight figures for the lunar module were based on certain operational assumptions that Houston considered absolutely inadequate for the mission. So, as Houston added realistic requirements to the Houbolt scheme it lost a lot of its original charm. In the end, everybody wondered whether the lunar orbit rendezvous mode would still look attractive by the time the necessary realism had been instilled in it.",5,One of my favorites,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,3338,"['Six-part', 'documentary', 'six', 'systems', 'were', 'part', 'Apollo', 'Moon', 'Project:1', 'Saturn', 'V', 'Rocket2', 'Command', 'Module3', 'Navigation', 'Computer4', 'Lunar', 'Lander5', 'Space', 'Suit6', 'Lunar', 'RoverEach', 'episode', 'contains', 'commentaries', 'dozen', 'so', 'original', 'Engineers/Managers/Technicians', 'who', 'worked', 'specific', 'systems', 'interspersed', 'videos', 'relevant', 'commentaries', 'episode', 'least', '2', '3', 'problems', 'had', 'be', 'overcome', 'develop', 'critical', 'systems', 'most', 'critical', 'high', 'point', 'Apollo', 'Mission', 'perspective', 'who', 'worked', 'individual', 'systems.I', 'watch', 'documentaries', 'Saturn', 'V', 'episode', 'favorite.It', 'opinion', 'way', 'Lunar', 'Lander', 'episode', 'Von', 'Braun', 'finally', 'came', 'accept', 'Houbolt', 'Lunar', 'Orbit', 'Rendezvous', 'LOR', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'moon', '10', 'year', 'goal', 'set', 'Kennedy', 'over-simplified', 'misleading', 'really', 'facts', 'number', 'ways', 'see', 'one', 'can', 'read', 'account', 'Von', 'Braun', 'own', 'opinion', 'subject', 'online', 'article', 'two', 'interviews', 'Dr', 'Von', 'Braun', 'conducted', 'August', '25', '1970', 'November', '17', '1971', 'Von', 'Braun', 'clearly', 'record', 'subject', 'so', 'Robert', 'Seamans', 'documentary', 'made', '2008/2009', 'would', 'take', 'opinion', 'unfair', 'outdated', 'representation', 'situation', 'apparently', 'cooked', 'up', 'press', 'late', '60', 'sensationalist', 'angle', 'bit', 'misleading', 'important/main', 'historical', 'subject', 'particular', 'episode.For', 'example', 'Sample', 'Excerpt', 'Interview', '1', 'Apollo', 'Spacecraft', 'Chronology', 'are', 'quoted', 'saying', 'true', 'long', 'time', 'were', 'not', 'favor', 'lunar', 'orbit', 'rendezvous', 'favored', 'Earth', 'orbit', 'rendezvous', 'Von', 'Braun', 'Well', 'actually', 'even', 'not', 'quite', 'correct', 'outset', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'route', '[', 'Apollo', 'travel', 'Moon', ']', 'was', 'most', 'promising', 'made', 'agreement', 'Houston', 'Marshall', 'would', 'concentrate', 'study', 'Earth', 'orbit', 'rendezvous', 'did', 'not', 'mean', 'wanted', 'sell', 'preferred', 'scheme', 'were', ""n't"", 'ready', 'vote', 'yet', 'study', 'was', 'meant', 'merely', 'identify', 'problems', 'involved', 'agreement', 'also', 'said', 'Houston', 'would', 'concentrate', 'studying', 'lunar', 'rendezvous', 'mode', 'Only', 'groups', 'had', 'done', 'homework', 'would', 'compare', 'notes', 'agreement', 'was', 'based', 'common', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'selling', 'scheme', 'are', 'convinced', 'superior', 'outset', 'Houston', 'Marshall', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'approach', 'fact', 'Houston', 'happened', 'study', 'lunar', 'orbit', 'rendezvous', 'mode', 'was', 'purely', 'coincidental', 'mode', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'originate', 'Houston-it', 'was', 'first', 'proposed', 'John', 'Houbolt', 'Langley', 'Center', 'problem', 'Houbolt', 'original', 'study', 'was', 'weight', 'figures', 'lunar', 'module', 'were', 'based', 'certain', 'operational', 'assumptions', 'Houston', 'considered', 'absolutely', 'inadequate', 'mission', 'So', 'Houston', 'added', 'realistic', 'requirements', 'Houbolt', 'scheme', 'lost', 'lot', 'original', 'charm', 'end', 'everybody', 'wondered', 'lunar', 'orbit', 'rendezvous', 'mode', 'would', 'still', 'look', 'attractive', 'time', 'necessary', 'realism', 'had', 'been', 'instilled']",Moon Machines
