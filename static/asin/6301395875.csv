251194,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,6301395875,CodeMaster Talon,"[6, 6]","This is a 4.5 star review rounded up to 5, because I have a crush on Jon Hall and can't help myself.There's old-timey eye-candy a' plenty in the little known but very solid cavalry Western ""Kit Carson"", just released on DVD this year. Dana Andrews and Jon Hall (more on him in a minute) star in a highly inaccurate account of the famous Carson/Fremont expeditions, with many delightful veteran character actors along for the ride.Kit Carson and his besties have just returned from a looooong sojourn and want nothing more than to rest a spell and take baths all day long. But waiting for them at Fort Bridger (which we might remember from hours of playing ""Oregon Trail"" as middle schoolers) is Captain John C. Fremont (Andrews, handsome as ever) and a whole wagon train itching to go west to Californy. Carson knows this is a bad idea because A) He just came from fighting the Shoshone, who despite falling for a ruse that wouldn't fool a backward toddler did manage to shoot up his entire outfit except for Kit and the aforementioned besties and B) The wagon train is teeming with little kids and pretty women and who knows what else and they're all a' gonna die the tender-footed greenhorns. So he says no and tries to go back to taking baths, but the beautiful Dolores Murphy (strong-willed Lynn Bari) bribes/guilts him into changing his mind. From there it's one dang fool thing after another: Indian attacks, General Castro attacks, Dolores sneaking up on him to apologize for calling him a savage, etc. Action packed and weirdly fun, the plot rolls along at a brisk clip until finally we find ourselves fighting for Californian independence with General Castro and a hacienda filled with stuffed dummies.My Dad got this movie for me because he knows I love Dana Andrews, and Andrews plays his role better than it's written, as usual. The real surprise here and what makes the film worth buying (for me, anyway) is Jon Hall, as Kit Carson. Hall was half Swiss and half Tahitian (!!) and the resulting mix of exotic beauty and athleticism makes him a mesmerizing screen presence (what he could have done with a role like The Virginian, we'll never know.). A fine actor, he turns a one-dimensional role into a complex portrayal of a frontiersman: Gentle but strong, humble but with personal pride in his work, plainly educated yet knowing and astute. He has strong chemistry with Bari, and the love triangle with Andrews is interesting, avoiding the clich&eacute;s of Hollywood romance. You'd be hard-pressed to find another scene in any western like the one where Andrews and Hall talk over who should get Bari. A more gentlemanly discussion of frustrated love I've never heard.So there you have it, what to watch when you run out of Fords and Hawks. Good dialogue, fine performances (Harold Huber and Ward Bond as Carson's sidekicks deserve special mention; the three men have the vibe of genuine friends), lots of action and a bit of romance. Five stars is generous, as this no ""Red River"". But I liked the little moment when Bari's knitting and looks down at Hall, who smiles in a boyish way at the ground. I liked Hall picking her up and telling her it's time for little girls to go to bed, and Bari looking like she'd REALLY like to kiss him, after she slaps him. I liked Andrews thanking Bari for the ""greatest privilege of my life"", protecting her. I liked Hall and Andrews constantly telling Bari how great the other one is.I liked it, five stars worth of liking.GRADE: ASide Note: If you see this, watch for the Shoshone/Wagon Train Battle Scene, with a great wide shot of the circled wagons surrounded by the furiously riding Shoshone.

Other actors, such as dashing Dana Andrews and Miriam Hopkins, also gave strong performances.  The action was nonstop and the romantic element did not impede the tempo of the plot.  THis was a colourised version of the film, which was a plus for me, although the colourisation process sometimes resulted in colours that were too vivid and lacked the naturalness of other filming processes.  The fact that the film has not historical, despite using characters based on real people like Kit Carson and John Fremont, did not detract from the excitement.
