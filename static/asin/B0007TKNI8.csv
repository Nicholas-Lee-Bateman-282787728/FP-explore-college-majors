889778,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0007TKNI8,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[6, 9]","(3.5) Going into a musical, one expects to open one's senses.  Andrew Lloyd Webber, not quite at the height of his powers, gives us a few reasons to celebrate his musical brought to the screen in Joel Schumacher's rendition of `Phantom of the Opera'.There are two main interlocking stories, and while they give one another meaning, they sometimes are conflicting to the musical's spirit.  In front of the stage, Andre (Simon Cowell) has acquired the Paris Opera House.  He must keep everyone happy, particularly his siren voiced prima donna beauty, Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson).  She now must compete with her understudy, the equally alluring and talented, Christine (Emmy Rossum).  At night, darkness takes over as she is seduced by the mysterious ""Phantom"" (Gerard Butler).  He takes her beyond the underground of the city's sewers to his own lair.  However, like the classic story, his love of beauty reaches a vengeful crescendo.  The scenes where the two are together are filled with tenderness with Webber's songs truly suited for the occasion.  Chills run down one's spine during this element of the movie, but compared toCats - The Musical (Ultimate Edition), Webber doesn't provide this often enough.Schumacher's careful shooting is impeccable.  The camera turns in a cemetery scene are nearly flawless and the art direction is superb.  The focus, lighting, and framing are what all musicals should contain.  Besides the accomplished voices of Rossum and Richardson, both leading ladies have a breathtaking beauty.  Matched by early performances by Butler and Wilson, the movie provides hunky handsomeness for women as well.  There's a lot to look at in this beautiful film.My main criticism is that some of the best elements are punctured by the main story.  We need to see the front of the stage to appreciate the backstage developments, but some of ""the show must go on"" sentiments and songs go better with `A Chorus Line,' but not here.  A comparison with the best musicals, including 'The Sound of Music,' 'Oliver!' 'An American in Paris,' `Amadeus,' and the recent release of 'Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,' all point to a story and song venue that resonate much better throughout.As a sensual feast, 'Phantom of the Opera' belts the best notes through the opera house; as a vehicle for the best songs and best story execution, the venue falters in places and makes all the atmospherics go flat.  I fault no one for their enthusiasm for this film, but the cohesiveness is spotty due to some of it's failings.A J.P.'s Pick 3.5 *'s=Good-Very Good",3,Sensual Feast with Songs for a Beast,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,2582,"['3.5', 'Going', 'musical', 'one', 'open', 'one', 'senses', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'not', 'quite', 'height', 'powers', 'few', 'reasons', 'celebrate', 'musical', 'brought', 'screen', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'rendition', 'Phantom', ""Opera'.There"", 'are', 'two', 'main', 'interlocking', 'stories', 'give', 'one', 'meaning', 'sometimes', 'are', 'conflicting', 'musical', 'spirit', 'front', 'stage', 'Andre', 'Simon', 'Cowell', 'acquired', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'House', 'must', 'keep', 'everyone', 'happy', 'particularly', 'siren', 'voiced', 'prima', 'donna', 'beauty', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'now', 'must', 'compete', 'understudy', 'equally', 'alluring', 'talented', 'Christine', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'night', 'darkness', 'over', 'seduced', 'mysterious', 'Phantom', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'underground', 'city', 'sewers', 'own', 'lair', 'However', 'classic', 'story', 'love', 'beauty', 'vengeful', 'crescendo', 'scenes', 'where', 'two', 'are', 'together', 'are', 'filled', 'tenderness', 'Webber', 'songs', 'truly', 'suited', 'occasion', 'Chills', 'run', 'down', 'one', 'spine', 'element', 'movie', 'compared', 'toCats', 'Musical', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', 'Webber', ""n't"", 'provide', 'often', 'enough.Schumacher', 'careful', 'shooting', 'impeccable', 'camera', 'cemetery', 'scene', 'are', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'art', 'direction', 'superb', 'focus', 'lighting', 'framing', 'are', 'what', 'musicals', 'should', 'contain', 'accomplished', 'voices', 'Rossum', 'Richardson', 'leading', 'ladies', 'have', 'breathtaking', 'beauty', 'Matched', 'early', 'performances', 'Butler', 'Wilson', 'movie', 'hunky', 'handsomeness', 'women', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'look', 'beautiful', 'film.My', 'main', 'criticism', 'best', 'elements', 'are', 'punctured', 'main', 'story', 'need', 'see', 'front', 'stage', 'appreciate', 'backstage', 'developments', 'show', 'must', 'go', 'sentiments', 'songs', 'go', 'better', 'Chorus', 'Line', 'not', 'here', 'comparison', 'best', 'musicals', 'including', ""'The"", 'Sound', 'Music', ""'Oliver"", ""'An"", 'American', 'Paris', 'Amadeus', 'recent', 'release', ""'Sweeney"", 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'point', 'story', 'song', 'venue', 'resonate', 'much', 'better', 'throughout.As', 'sensual', 'feast', ""'Phantom"", 'Opera', 'belts', 'best', 'notes', 'opera', 'house', 'vehicle', 'best', 'songs', 'best', 'story', 'execution', 'venue', 'falters', 'places', 'atmospherics', 'go', 'flat', 'fault', 'one', 'enthusiasm', 'film', 'cohesiveness', 'spotty', 'due', 'failings.A', 'J.P.', 'Pick', '3.5', ""*'s=Good-Very"", 'Good']",N/A

The songs are great, the characters are amazing, and the actors and actresses themselves made this movie awesome.  I've watched this movie more times than I have fingers, so that goes to show how much I love it.  This is the only movie that I've bought with my own money, + the soundtrack.Patrick Wilson is amazing.  I love his smooth voice when he sings, and these confused looks he gets on his face when he talks to Christine about the Phantom. Should've been nominated for Best Supporting Actor somewhere, even if not the Oscars.Emmy Rossum is absolutely fantastic in this movie.  At the age of sixteen she absolutely showed that she has one of the brightest futures in Hollywood right now.  She totally stole the show.  Her voice is so powerful, and you can feel how frightened she is as she sings and speaks of the Phantom. I love that girl!!Gerard Butler is the most amazingly talented, (plus amazingly hot), actor that I have seen from this century so far.  You can feel his emotions when he sings the songs even when you are only listening to the soundtrack.  When you see it on screen, it totally rips my heart out to see his eyes, his tears and his love for Christine.  If it were up to me, I would've given him some recognition for his splendid take on the misunderstood Phantom.Recommended for anyone who enjoys a good musical, and possibly a good cry, too.  100 out of 10 stars for me!!",5,The Best Musical EVER!!!,1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,1458,"['Phantom', 'Opera', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'EVER', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'characters', 'are', 'amazing', 'actors', 'made', 'movie', 'awesome', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'more', 'times', 'have', 'fingers', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'only', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'own', 'money', '+', 'soundtrack.Patrick', 'Wilson', 'amazing', 'love', 'smooth', 'voice', 'when', 'confused', 'looks', 'face', 'when', 'Christine', 'Phantom', 'Should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'somewhere', 'even', 'not', 'Oscars.Emmy', 'Rossum', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'age', 'sixteen', 'absolutely', 'showed', 'one', 'brightest', 'futures', 'Hollywood', 'right', 'now', 'totally', 'stole', 'show', 'voice', 'so', 'powerful', 'can', 'feel', 'how', 'frightened', 'speaks', 'Phantom', 'love', 'girl', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'most', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'amazingly', 'hot', 'actor', 'have', 'seen', 'century', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'feel', 'emotions', 'when', 'songs', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'only', 'listening', 'soundtrack', 'When', 'see', 'screen', 'totally', 'heart', 'see', 'eyes', 'tears', 'love', 'Christine', 'were', 'up', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', 'recognition', 'splendid', 'take', 'misunderstood', 'Phantom.Recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'musical', 'possibly', 'good', 'cry', 'too', '100', '10', 'stars']",N/A

889784,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,B0007TKNI8,A Customer,"[0, 1]","The thing about a musical is that if you don't like the music, it really sucks. Fortunately, I knew I loved the theme because I copied it from Donald's iPod. It's just so haunting, isn't it? How about the movie? Let's watch.It's a Joel Schumacher film. Hey, didn't he kill the Batman franchise? I asked Google. Yep. That's because he was supposed to be making this movie, not those movies. It's just so atmospheric, and the acting is secondary to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber and to the scenery. His style and this movie are a perfect fit.I do want to warn you that, if you go out and get this, the first music after the theme is supposed to be bad, so don't give up on me yet.We have a love triangle, petty intrigues, manipulative people, over-the-top humor, shades of AMADEUS, some chuckles at the lyrics when they get playful, spooky chilling stuff that literally gave me goosebumps. The original novel was obviously powerful, and nothing's been lost in translation here. Since about 90% of the dialogue is sung, it's a good thing I love the music. A love scene or two seems painfully long because it's sung, but that's okay. If I can be patient, so can you.As for the plot, everything you already know about it happens quickly, so it's no plot spoiler to say the hideous guy in the mask is in love with the lovely lady and does something about it. My life, actually. I'm pretty hideous, and Jan's a beauty. Except that in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, I believe we all want ugly to win.And then the second of my two VCDs didn't work. Damn! I read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia after that. Schumaker wasn't 100% true to it, but I don't mind. I've got a feel for what it's about now, even though I'm sure I missed the best part.

889786,AO31JF8HT1ONU,B0007TKNI8,"Adam J. Fernandes ""DarkWriter""","[2, 9]","WARNING: SPOLIERS AHEADI have mixed feelings about this film. I saw The Phantom live in San Francisco when I was fourteen and it was truly a mind altering experience. Everything about the production was first rate, the costumes, the music, and the singing especially the Phantom, played by Davis Gaines, whose power lept off the stage.When I heard a movie was being made I was apprehensious to say the least. Seeing Joel Shumacher's name as the director was part of the reason for that. After seeing him butcher Batman, I was concerned that he would take too many liberties with this. Thankfully he did keep some things of the show, and enough of them to keep it going. Unfortunately, he didn't keep enough of them in.The Good:Emmy Rossum is luminescent as Christine. She plays the character as innocent and as naive, more so than the stage version. Her voice has the clear quality that it brings chills to the spine, it's the best in the film. Patrick Wilson stumbles a bit with the role. Never crossing over in Errol Flynn like heroism, but confident with his voice. My one requirement with the songs was that they not completely screw up ""All I Ask of You,"" which is my favorite song in the show, and their voices meld perfectly. The costume and production design elevate and go beyond the orginal show, giving it the sumptious quality it always deserved. The cinematography is excellent, no surprise since John Matheison is a genius at using existing light and shadows to further the effects of the already incredible sets. The music is so much more lush than the stage version, naturally. The added moment of the phantom's orgins was pretty cool as well.The Bad:Gerard Butler? Sorry buddy, you sound like an American Idol reject. You need someone in this roll that has power in his voice as well as a tortured sound, Gerard has none of that. As well as the fact that his face which, in the stage play, looked disfiguring and something that would explain his isolation, fear, and horror look know looks like a bad sunburn.The ""Masquerade section, although extremely well done as far as the costumes and sets for the extras go, falls apart when the Phantom appears. He is supposed to be The Mask of the Red Death from Edgar Allen Poe's legendary story and in the stage show, he's wearing a mask that like Lon Chaney's version, fills the onlookers with horror at seeing him. His mask is a full on skull, without a semblence of face behind it. In the film, it's a smaller mask, only covering up the eyes and the nose only. It's not scary or awe inspiring.The sword fight is unecessary. Everything before that is wonderful, it's just that the fight itself doesn't solve anything or lead anywhere. They could've gotten the same result in a more dramatic way and it doesn't fit with the Phantom's character. Throughout the film you see him in the shadows. He takes out people conspicuously and mysteriously to create an ambient level of fear, all the while maintaining a ghostly appearance. It has the feeling of they put it in because they could.The ""Point of No Return"" was where I screamed the loudest when I saw it. The dancers in the backround are an uneeded distraction, it's completely pointless for them to be there. Christine is gorgeous but the Phantom, wooing her in the stage production under a cloak and always too close for the guards to shoot her, know is behind a cowboy and indian mask and only touches her toward the end.The ending, with him leaving through the mirror, doesn't have the same shock as the original.All in all I was impresed with some, dissapointed with some obvious stuff, and grateful to see so much of it on screen. If you've seen this movie and haven't seen the show, don't worry.

I've liked this musical since I heard the original casts' recording as a teenager. In college I finally had the opportunity to watch the musical in NY and put action and faces to the voices and music I had enjoyed for so long. Now, many years later, a movie version has come out. I did not know how I would respond to it, given that I liked the original version so much that any deviation would seem blasphemous! Well, I watched it and I DID like it! Here is what I did not like: The duel at the cemetery was strange and out of pace with the rest of the story. I agree with the reviewer who said that the Phantom would never have lost to young Raoul. It made him seem weak and less menacing. I'm pretending it never happened. And this is why I gave the movie 4 rather than 5 stars. Annoying also: some of the lines were spoken rather than sung. Anyone familiar with the original will be irked. Otherwise, it doesn't make a big difference.What I did like:* Emmy Rossum is lovely as the naive Christine. And she sings beautifully, too!* The movie explains a bit how the Phantom came to haunt the Opera in a way that isn't too intrusive or distracting.* The stage version always gave me the impression that the Phantom was obsessed with Christine and that she, once she figured out he was not a real angel, was truly afraid. In this version you have all that plus something else: an irresistible attraction between the Phantom and Christine. She is hopelessly drawn to him. Raoul's fear isn't just that she will be snatched by the Phantom, but that she'll willingly give in and go to him. They are, after all, kindred spirits in the sense that they love music, the theater, and share true talent. I liked that spin on the story.* The sets and costumes are opulent and lavish. Real eye candy.* Minnie Driver is a supremely funny Carlotta. She ad libs but it  is all consistent with her character.* I liked the flashforwards to the present time in the shades of gray (1920). The ""old"" characters got a good make up job- very believable.The ending was thoughtful, although not unexpected.It is hard to move away from the original casts' recording when listening to the songs in the movie, but it's just a question of getting used to new voices singing old favorites. Some of the actors' voices are better than others, but all in all the result is good, even if at moments you find yourself longing for a little occasional dubbing by the original cast...Now, totally irrelevant to the enjoyment of the film: did anyone else find the actor who played Raoul a dead ringer for Carson Kressley from Queer Eye? I found it distracting and half expected him to give the Phantom a make over... :-)",4,A different spin on the musical (caution-spoilers),1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,2767,"['Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'are', 'new', 'story', 'review', 'spoilers', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'musical', 'heard', 'original', 'casts', 'recording', 'teenager', 'college', 'finally', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'musical', 'NY', 'put', 'action', 'voices', 'music', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'long', 'Now', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'movie', 'version', 'come', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'would', 'respond', 'given', 'liked', 'original', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'deviation', 'would', 'seem', 'blasphemous', 'Well', 'watched', 'DID', 'Here', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'duel', 'cemetery', 'was', 'strange', 'pace', 'rest', 'story', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'Phantom', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'lost', 'young', 'Raoul', 'made', 'seem', 'weak', 'less', 'menacing', ""'m"", 'pretending', 'never', 'happened', 'why', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'rather', '5', 'stars', 'Annoying', 'also', 'lines', 'were', 'spoken', 'rather', 'sung', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'original', 'will', 'be', 'irked', 'Otherwise', ""n't"", 'make', 'big', 'difference.What', 'did', '*', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'lovely', 'naive', 'Christine', 'beautifully', 'too', '*', 'movie', 'bit', 'how', 'Phantom', 'came', 'haunt', 'Opera', 'way', ""n't"", 'too', 'intrusive', 'distracting', '*', 'stage', 'version', 'always', 'gave', 'impression', 'Phantom', 'was', 'obsessed', 'Christine', 'once', 'figured', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'angel', 'was', 'truly', 'afraid', 'version', 'have', 'something', 'else', 'irresistible', 'attraction', 'Phantom', 'Christine', 'hopelessly', 'drawn', 'Raoul', 'fear', ""n't"", 'just', 'will', 'be', 'snatched', 'Phantom', ""'ll"", 'willingly', 'give', 'go', 'are', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'sense', 'love', 'music', 'theater', 'share', 'true', 'talent', 'liked', 'spin', 'story', '*', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'opulent', 'lavish', 'Real', 'eye', 'candy', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'supremely', 'funny', 'Carlotta', 'ad', 'libs', 'consistent', 'character', '*', 'liked', 'flashforwards', 'present', 'time', 'shades', 'gray', '1920', 'old', 'characters', 'got', 'good', 'make', 'up', 'job-', 'very', 'believable.The', 'ending', 'was', 'thoughtful', 'not', 'unexpected.It', 'hard', 'move', 'away', 'original', 'casts', 'recording', 'when', 'listening', 'songs', 'movie', 'just', 'question', 'getting', 'used', 'new', 'voices', 'singing', 'old', 'favorites', 'actors', 'voices', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'result', 'good', 'even', 'moments', 'find', 'longing', 'little', 'occasional', 'dubbing', 'original', 'cast', 'Now', 'totally', 'irrelevant', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'did', 'anyone', 'else', 'find', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Raoul', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Carson', 'Kressley', 'Queer', 'Eye', 'found', 'distracting', 'half', 'expected', 'give', 'Phantom', 'make']",N/A

889792,A1S26JXPQKFVPI,B0007TKNI8,Alexander Arsov,"[1, 1]","By far the greatest asset of this movie is the visual side. The costumes, the make-up and the sets are sumptuous historical affairs of rare beauty. The direction is flawless and captures to perfection both the lyrical and the sinister side of the story. The special effects, of course, are breathtaking: the transformation scene of the opera house, from old and dusty to new and glittering, is a visual tour de force. It's worth the price of admission alone.There is not a hint of anything stagey or static. The musical has been realized as a full-scale movie and has benefited from all advantages of modern cinema. It's a magnificent spectacle, a must for everybody who loves Andrew Lloyd Webber's original.The cast is problematic. The acting ranges from good to excellent, and some minor comic parts are wonderfully enlivened by Simon Callow and Mini Driver. But this is not an ordinary movie. It's a musical. And the music really does matter. This is where the problems start.Gerard Butler is the main vocal disappointment. He looks perfect for the part and his acting is more than competent. But the man simply doesn't have the voice. He has nothing to be ashamed of: Michael Crawford himself is not always convincing in the Original Broadway Cast recording. The Phantom is a monstrous part. It requires powerful voice and vast range of expression (from tender lyricism to sheer madness). Gerry Butler does the only possible thing: he exaggerates the recitatives and disrupts the melodic lines in a futile attempt to compensate for his vocal inadequacy. As a result, in the lyrical moments he sounds bland, in the dramatic ones he is almost comic.Emmy Rossum has a voice almost as sweet as her face. Unfortunately it's thin, weak and, in the more dramatic moments, strained. When the Phantom demands ""Sing for me!"" she is quite incapable of rising to the occasion. She conveys the charm and innocence of Christine with rare skill. But when it comes to vocal acting, her performance leaves a good deal to be desired.Patrick Wilson seems to be the best among the principals. But that may well be because his part is far less prominent. The rest of the cast, as I have already said, is excellent.The music itself might have been recorded more spectacularly. That would at any rate have benefited the visual splendor and the dark gothic atmosphere, both completely and rightly over-the-top. But the 5.1 sound will knock your socks off anyway.All in all, despite the persistently lackluster vocal performance, the movie is an unforgettable experience. The fairy-tale story, though a trifle inane, contains more than enough serious overtones to make it still relevant. ALW's music is timeless. One thing is sure: having seen this movie, you'll never again listen to the OBC recording (or any other) with the same visual images in your mind. Better singing you may be able find at many other audio or video recordings, although the perfect Phantom has not been recorded yet, and probably it never will be. But for sheer visual glamour, intensity and power, Joel Schumacher's epic can hardly be bettered, let alone surpassed.",4,Visually magnificent but vocally mediocre,1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,3121,"['far', 'greatest', 'asset', 'movie', 'visual', 'side', 'costumes', 'make-up', 'sets', 'are', 'sumptuous', 'historical', 'affairs', 'rare', 'beauty', 'direction', 'flawless', 'captures', 'perfection', 'lyrical', 'sinister', 'side', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'course', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'transformation', 'scene', 'opera', 'house', 'old', 'new', 'glittering', 'visual', 'tour', 'force', 'price', 'admission', 'not', 'hint', 'anything', 'stagey', 'static', 'musical', 'been', 'realized', 'full-scale', 'movie', 'benefited', 'advantages', 'modern', 'cinema', 'magnificent', 'spectacle', 'must', 'everybody', 'who', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'original.The', 'cast', 'problematic', 'acting', 'ranges', 'good', 'excellent', 'minor', 'comic', 'parts', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'enlivened', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Mini', 'Driver', 'not', 'ordinary', 'movie', 'musical', 'music', 'really', 'matter', 'where', 'problems', 'start.Gerard', 'Butler', 'main', 'vocal', 'disappointment', 'perfect', 'part', 'acting', 'more', 'competent', 'man', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'voice', 'nothing', 'be', 'ashamed', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'not', 'always', 'convincing', 'Original', 'Broadway', 'Cast', 'recording', 'Phantom', 'monstrous', 'part', 'powerful', 'voice', 'vast', 'range', 'expression', 'tender', 'lyricism', 'sheer', 'madness', 'Gerry', 'Butler', 'only', 'possible', 'thing', 'recitatives', 'melodic', 'lines', 'futile', 'attempt', 'compensate', 'vocal', 'inadequacy', 'result', 'lyrical', 'moments', 'bland', 'dramatic', 'ones', 'almost', 'comic.Emmy', 'Rossum', 'voice', 'almost', 'as', 'sweet', 'face', 'thin', 'weak', 'more', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'strained', 'When', 'Phantom', 'Sing', 'quite', 'incapable', 'rising', 'occasion', 'conveys', 'charm', 'innocence', 'Christine', 'rare', 'skill', 'when', 'vocal', 'acting', 'performance', 'good', 'deal', 'be', 'desired.Patrick', 'Wilson', 'be', 'best', 'principals', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'part', 'far', 'less', 'prominent', 'rest', 'cast', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'excellent.The', 'music', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', 'more', 'spectacularly', 'would', 'rate', 'have', 'benefited', 'visual', 'splendor', 'dark', 'gothic', 'atmosphere', 'completely', 'rightly', 'over-the-top', '5.1', 'sound', 'will', 'knock', 'socks', 'off', 'anyway.All', 'persistently', 'lackluster', 'vocal', 'performance', 'movie', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'fairy-tale', 'story', 'trifle', 'inane', 'more', 'enough', 'serious', 'overtones', 'make', 'still', 'relevant', 'ALW', 'music', 'timeless', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'never', 'again', 'listen', 'OBC', 'recording', 'other', 'same', 'visual', 'images', 'mind', 'Better', 'singing', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'many', 'other', 'audio', 'video', 'recordings', 'perfect', 'Phantom', 'not', 'been', 'recorded', 'yet', 'probably', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'sheer', 'visual', 'glamour', 'intensity', 'power', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'epic', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'bettered', 'let', 'alone', 'surpassed']",N/A

I thought Patrick Wilson was appropriately debonair and handsome, and he also had a nice voice. Gerard Butler's voice could have been stronger, but it was by no means awful. As others have pointed out, though, he was a tad too handsome for this role. At one point during the movie, I whispered to my friend, ""Isn't he too hot to be the Phantom?""I really enjoyed the expanded backstory on the Phantom -- I felt the movie made him more sympathetic and less one-dimensional than the play did.Overall, I was delighted by the movie in a way I never was by the play.

Sure, it does take away some of the dramatics of the stage... but I enjoyed it for what it was.Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford would have been great, but I like Emmy and Gerard too. Original London Cast or the film cast, I like both of them.Emmy Rossum is quite an actress and singer! She isn't as operatic as Sarah Brightman, but what a voice! So strong, clear, and crystalline, and an impressive range! And at her age? This young lady is going to go quite a distance! I'm impressed that she'd never seen the play before and that she's nailed this role dead-on.Gerard Butler...! He just stole the show for me! His dusky singing voice is actually quite lovely concidering that he's not this highly-trained vocal acrobat. Michael Crawford has a lovely tenor, but it seems lightweight, and not rich and full enough to pull off Erik's role, in my opinion.Gerard actually hits those high notes quite well. He's able to go into the tenor range for more intimate, romantic moments, and into the baritone for the highly dramatic ones. He has gotten some criticism for being too young and handsome (and cute) for Erik, but I don't care about that. He has Erik's strong, mysterious, tempramental, and *very* sensual nature! And he's totally sympathetic and poignant as Erik, especially after ""All I Ask of You"" and at the grand finale. I just wanted to hold him at such moments. Obvious stalking put aside, I just can't see why Christine chose Raoul over Erik.Patrick Wilson's Raoul is handsome and has a lovely voice, and he has more backbone than in the play... but I still don't care for Raoul, mainly that he took Christine away from Erik when he could have gotten any mademoiselle.Minnie Driver is a wonderfully obnoxious but funny Carlotta! Margaret Preese(I think that's her name) did a wonderful job lending her singing to Minnie's Calotta. Minnie's actual singing voice in ""Learn To Be Lonely"" is very unique.

Rossum is also a casting coup, and the doe-eyed Jennifer Beal look-a-like fully captures the essence of Christine, the Phantom perpetual flava-of-the-month.The movie had me spellbound from Act one, Scene one until the closing credits, and I highly recommend it to you.Amanda Richards, September 12, 2005",5,Had me humming all day!,1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,1220,"['Five', 'stars', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Beautifully', 'orchestrated', 'acted', 'performed', 'movie', 'version', 'theatrical', 'masterpiece', 'proud.Gerard', 'Butler', 'so', 'handsome', 'yet', 'so', 'intense', 'portrayal', 'tormented', 'Phantom', 'were', 'Christine', 'excellent', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Raoul', 'guy', 'vocally', 'gifted', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'drag', 'underground', 'boudoir', 'wild', 'horses', 'bulldozer.Wilson', 'seemed', 'teenager', 'love', 'compared', 'agonized', 'yearning', 'Phantom', 'different', 'musical', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hopping', 'gazebo', 'rain', 'singing', 'Sixteen', 'Going', 'Seventeen', '.Minnie', 'Driver', 'fine', 'comedy', 'turn', 'Prima', 'Donna', 'Carlotta', ""n't"", 'actually', 'sing', 'movie', 'credit', 'worthy', 'number', 'credits', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'longtime', 'keeper', 'Phantom', 'secret', 'Rossum', 'also', 'casting', 'coup', 'doe-eyed', 'Jennifer', 'Beal', 'look-a-like', 'fully', 'essence', 'Christine', 'Phantom', 'perpetual', 'flava-of-the-month.The', 'movie', 'had', 'spellbound', 'Act', 'one', 'Scene', 'one', 'closing', 'credits', 'highly', 'recommend', 'you.Amanda', 'Richards', 'September', '12', '2005']",N/A

Gerard Butler doesn't really sound like Michael Crawford, la la la...""Ummm...I'm going to take a guess that these critics did not read the casting before they saw it and were thus disappointed?""Phantom"" is not meant to be an absolute re-creation of Crawford and Brightman's brilliant stage performances.  Anybody who went into the theatre expecting that was BOUND to be disappointed.But there are some great perks to the film.  The introduction, where the raising of the chandelier corresponds with special effects to recreate the Opera Populaire in its heyday gave me goosebumps.Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum have incredible chemistry.  In fact, my biggest problem was ""accepting"" the fact that Phantom is supposed to be a hideous deformed pyshopath (Butler is sinfully handsome, and no suspension of disbelief can change the fact.) Theirs is a more romantic and erotic depiction of the love triangle.Butler's voice is rich and sensual, more geared towards a rock sound than Crawford's portrayal.  This makes it DIFFERENT, not necessarily BAD.  Rossum is a joy to hear.It was also refreshing to see Raul involved in some action scenes instead of his portrayal in the musical of a trust fund baby waiting for the opera star to hand herself to him on a plate.I've seen the stage version twice, and was very pleased with the film.

First, Gerard Butler--yum!  I loved Michael Crawford's phantom, but Gerard brings a sensuality and emotional depth to the role I have not seen before.  I would also say that I enjoyed his singing voice better than any I have heard before because he placed such EMOTION into each song.  He made us FEEL his rage, despair, love and desperation as if they were our own.  Emmy Rossum was perfect as Christine.  She has a beautiful voice that I felt was a perfect compliment for Gerard Butler's.  The entire cast  was supberb in my opinion (foremost was Minnie Driver's hysterical portrayal of the diva of the opera house).  Also, the costumes and scenery made the movie eye candy to look at.  Lastly, have a glass of ice water handy for the Phantom and Christine's sizzling rendition of Point of No Return near the end of the film.

What a great story!That being said, here's my view of the movie.The opening I found to be quite exciting; the transformation of the theatre from old to new was a breathtaking sequence. I loved the irony of the present being black and white and the past being color.Then, the story began to slow down a bit...no not a bit. It slammed the breaks and sent the audience flying through the windshield. What worked so well for the stage show just didn't seem right for film; and even those who often complain about being 'true to the source', some things just don't translate very well from one medium to another. A few songs should have been cut or shortened, so the pace wouldn't be so slow.For example, ""Wishing you were somehow here again"" is a great song, but it we were watching too much of Christine just wandering through the cemetary.Also, the song ""Phantom of the Opera"" was too fast paced for what was being shown on screen. (Christine and the Phantom floating in the boat). The sound and the picture didn't fit each other.Thankfully, the story picked up speed toward the end, and finished off nicely.

I have been fortunate enough to see Phantom performed live on stage and I have owned and adored the original London cast recording and hightlights from the play for several years now.  I would never deny credit to Michael Crawford or Sarah Brightman.  But this movie exceeded my expectations.  In fact, it blew away any previous version I've heard or seen.  I was stunned.The movie pays homage to the play and is almost too faithful in this stage-to-screen adaptation.  Almost.  It retains all of the beloved elements of the theatre including the mist and rising candles, the chandelier and the like, and then improves upon it by fully utilizing its new medium of film.The chemistry on-screen is electrifying, and culminates with the passionate performances in The Point of No Return.  Emmy Rossum is stunning, both visually and vocally, and Patrick Wilson's voice is pure and perfectly pitched-ideal for the role.But where the filmmakers really excelled was in their casting of Gerard Butler as the phantom.  Not only did he understand the appeal of the story and of the phantom itself, he truly threw himself into the role and captured the very soul of the phantom.  Although he only speaks eight lines of the movie (the rest being sung), it was easy to be so drawn in to the movie to even forget that it was a musical.  Gerard performed the role with a passion, intensity and reverence for the character that is not to be missed.  He has the right ""edge"" for the part and his performances are impassioned, sincere and heartbreaking.In fact, the cast is so enthralling that I found I had to buy the soundtrack just to keep myself from watching the movie!Andrew Lloyd Webber himself said this of the movie:""The film looks and sound fabulous...it's an extraordinarily fine document of the show.  Of course, it's a difference animal to the stage show...but it doesn't threaten the integrity of the show in any way.  ...if anything it's expanded it and given it perhaps and even deeper emotional centre.""Be open-minded and watch it already!

I anticipated sumptuous staging, terrific acting and, of course, musical performance at the highest levels.I got two out of the three.  PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is magnificently staged.  The stepping from black and white to color to indicate jumping back and forth in chronological time is superb.  When the theater, long forgotten and in decay, is suddenly transformed back in time to its former grandeur the effect is absolutely magical. Indeed, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, from the standpoint of cinematography, is a feast for the eyes.I was equally impressed with the acting abilities of the major characters.  Each brings to the screen the necessary abilities to pull in the viewer with total believability.Andrew Lloyd Webber's score, turning to the foundation of the movie's music, is incomparable!  Truly a modern musical genius, Webber's tone poetry is movingly beautiful.  Which brings me to the vocal performances. Without mincing words, the vocal performance, especially when considering the stage work of Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, was absolutely appalling!  I could hardly believe it.  How did the composer allow such mediocrity? I suppose that he may have wanted to preserve the sanctity of the stage original but even then I was perplexed. While Ms. Rossum (Christine) was moderately fine (though not coming remotely close to Brightman's defining performance in the role) Gerard Butler (The Phantom) was awful.  Yes, he brought considerable feeling to the tortured character of the Phantom but, then, I have already praised the acting in this film. Ironically, the only person with a real voice in the cast, Minnie Driver, was not allowed to sing, having her voiced dubbed.So there it is. Three stars for the staging, acting and cinematography.  I just cannot get past the terrible vocal performances.  If you have never heard the original stage soundtrack or seen the piece on stage you may be fine.  Otherwise, be prepared for a feast for the eyes but not the ears.THE HORSEMAN",3,YES AND NO,1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,2105,"['most', 'Phantom', 'aficionados', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'release', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'cinema', 'release', 'anticipated', 'sumptuous', 'staging', 'terrific', 'acting', 'course', 'musical', 'performance', 'highest', 'levels.I', 'got', 'two', 'three', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'magnificently', 'staged', 'stepping', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'indicate', 'jumping', 'back', 'forth', 'chronological', 'time', 'superb', 'When', 'theater', 'long', 'forgotten', 'decay', 'suddenly', 'transformed', 'back', 'time', 'former', 'grandeur', 'effect', 'absolutely', 'magical', 'Indeed', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'standpoint', 'cinematography', 'feast', 'eyes.I', 'was', 'equally', 'impressed', 'acting', 'abilities', 'major', 'characters', 'screen', 'necessary', 'abilities', 'pull', 'viewer', 'total', 'believability.Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'score', 'turning', 'foundation', 'movie', 'music', 'incomparable', 'Truly', 'modern', 'musical', 'genius', 'Webber', 'tone', 'poetry', 'movingly', 'beautiful', 'Which', 'vocal', 'performances', 'mincing', 'words', 'vocal', 'performance', 'especially', 'when', 'considering', 'stage', 'work', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'was', 'absolutely', 'appalling', 'could', 'hardly', 'believe', 'How', 'did', 'composer', 'allow', 'such', 'mediocrity', 'suppose', 'may', 'have', 'wanted', 'preserve', 'sanctity', 'stage', 'original', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'perplexed', 'Ms.', 'Rossum', 'Christine', 'was', 'moderately', 'fine', 'not', 'coming', 'remotely', 'close', 'Brightman', 'defining', 'performance', 'role', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'was', 'awful', 'Yes', 'brought', 'considerable', 'feeling', 'tortured', 'character', 'Phantom', 'then', 'have', 'already', 'praised', 'acting', 'film', 'Ironically', 'only', 'person', 'real', 'voice', 'cast', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'sing', 'having', 'voiced', 'dubbed.So', 'Three', 'stars', 'staging', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'terrible', 'vocal', 'performances', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'original', 'stage', 'soundtrack', 'seen', 'piece', 'stage', 'may', 'be', 'fine', 'Otherwise', 'be', 'prepared', 'feast', 'eyes', 'not', 'ears.THE', 'HORSEMAN']",N/A

For those of us pitiful souls who yearn to see the Broadway stage, movies such as this can still capture our romantic spirits and give us a taste of the greatness of musicals of the stage.

(I listen to the original sound track as I type and reflect the similarities/differences)I agree with one reviewer who said that the Phantom is a younger, sexier version of the deformed Phantom. It adds to the romantic appeal and desire, and heightens the pity of someone who yearns for what he cannot have. Instead of being repulsed by the external entirely, the focus is on the impurity of the soul as Christine puts it - the developed hatred and anger at the world. The attraction and seduction is also easier to believe for me. The scene in the Phantom's layer - the sexual tension!

However, as the years have passed and I have watched the DVD multiple times, I realize that I was wrong.  It has not withstood the test of time and the more I watch it, the more disappointed I become.  The movie lacks the most important aspect of any motion picture: emotion.  With perhaps the exception of Gerard Butler as the Phantom, most of the actors turn in a cookie-cutter, ho-hum performance that fails to meet what should be the  high expectations for this musical.Emmy Rossum has a beautiful voice as Christine.  However, she could not deliver a good performance overall.  In the scenes that required her to show some sense of emotion, all she can do is stare wide-eyed at everything, like a deer in the headlights.  She did that so much I wondered if her eyes are permanently stuck that way.  And then there's Patrick Wilson as Raoul.  Initially, it seemed like a good casting choice because he had Broadway experience.  But watching him play Raoul was like watching Keanu Reeves play Raoul.  Again, absolutely no emotion to speak of.  Also, what really got me was the age difference between Rossum and Wilson.  Christine and Raoul were supposed to be childhood sweethearts, according to the story.  But Wilson is at least 10 years older than Rossum if he's a day.  So are we to believe that when he was 17, he was in love with a 7 year old? (shudder.)Gerard Butler gave the only memorable performance.  He had all the Phantom moves down, including the swishing of his cape, and did pretty well vocally.  But the make-up job on him was horrendous.  The Phantom is supposed to be hideous and ugly.  When his mask is pulled off, it looked like he just had a few burns here and there.  I was hardly repulsed.  That's not Butler's fault, however.Anyway, if you want to see how it's really done, I strongly recommend getting the recently released 25th anniversary performance of Phantom.

889823,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0007TKNI8,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","I am a gigantic fan of the stage play `The Phantom of the Opera'.  I've seen it ten times and I'm actually planning on seeing it again in March.  I've seen it in Boston twice and once in New York.  I've seen nearly every adaptation of it.  I mean, I LOVE this story!  A few months ago I wrote a review for the 1925 film adaptation, which in my opinion is the best film adaptation of this story.  In that review I mentioned that I was a fan of this 04 version.  Truth of the matter is that I saw this twice in the theaters and I do own it, but as I've pondered this film (and recently rewatched it) I've come to realize that I'm not as much a fan as I thought.Here is why.As I thought about this version two things really stuck out for me.  Visually it was sublime.  I remember the first time I saw it, I was just literally spellbound.  It was seriously like my eyes were seeing heaven for the first time.  The clouds parted, the beams of light shone through, and there was Christine, singing her glorious little heart out.  The second thing that was ingrained in my head was that Gerard Butler was horribly bad in the title role.  While he carried with him a believable angst, his vocal power is just horrible.  He was off key, sloppy and lacked any grace and beauty (vocally) that is needed to carry this role.I have said numerous times that vocal strength is the most important thing when casting a musical, but throwing a vocally retarded actor like Pierce Brosnan a role in `Mama Mia!' is no where near as offensive as handing the coveted and prominent role of THE PHANTOM to an actor who cannot do it justice.So, as I settled in the other night to give this another whirl I started to realize that the film, while visually captivating (don't let anyone tell you otherwise), this film adaptation is missing something special...heart.While Emmy Rossum is stellar as Christine, she cannot carry this film on her own.  The main emotional focal point here is The Phantom, and Butler is not capable of making him a truly transcendent human being.  Because we are restricted from really seeing his face, it is his voice that needs to reach us, and Gerard is not able to do that.  While the story is still presented to us in whole form, it doesn't capture the emotional impact of previous adaptations (and of the stage play), even if this version is the most theatrical.  Of all the film adaptations, this is the most lavish and visually appealing, and it is the one that most resembles (visually) the stage play.  But, visuals are not everything, and sadly that is ALL that this film really provides.Aside from Rossum, who is, as I mentioned, stellar.As far as the supporting cast is concerned, the only standout for me was Minnie Driver, whose comedic performance is shrieky but memorably so.  She is funny and spunky and adds a nice touch to the film.  Patrick Wilson may be pretty (and his voice is immaculate) but he is awfully wooden here and totally forgettable.  I like him as an actor (especially his 06 work), but here he is just another set piece; something to look at but never truly `feel'.So, I recommend this because it is a captivating film, but it is not one that you will really take anything away from.

889826,A3C37W8WGMV8UQ,B0007TKNI8,Angela Dalecki,"[12, 13]","With the recent revival of movie musicals in Hollywood (Moulin Rouge!, Chicago), it seemed inevitable that eventually, a big-name composer and a big-name director would try to convert a big-name Broadway musical to film. Sure enough, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, a Joel Schumacher film, opened in select cities on December 22.A quick note: If you don't like musical theatre, or if you've seen Phantom on Broadway and hated it, or if you think Andrew Lloyd Webber should be tried for crimes against humanity because of his music...I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that you're not going to be crazy about this adaptation. However, if you're not in that particular category of people (and I hope you're not), then I'm willing to bet that you'll like this movie.If you're not familiar with the stage show, here's a quick summary of the story: Christine Daa&eacute; is a young ing&eacute;nue at the Paris Opera House. She's been taking music lessons from an unseen master who is referred to by the dancers as the ""Phantom of the Opera."" The Phantom is actually a disfigured man who lives beneath the opera house, and is...well, a little psychotic. The Phantom is in love with Christine, and while she feels a very strong attraction towards him, she's also in love with her childhood sweetheart, Raoul. The majority of the movie details the Phantom's growing obsession with Christine and the lengths he'll go to make her love him back.I adored this movie. I think the story and the music transferred brilliantly from stage to screen. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher made some excellent decisions regarding the plot-although there are some major changes from the stage version, the result is a simply brilliant film adaptation. Fans and critics have been especially divided over the director's choice of casting, so I'll take a few minutes to discuss the three principal characters: the Phantom, Christine, and Raoul.Gerard Butler (Dracula 2000, Timeline) plays the title character. His performance has spurred more heated discussions and arguments among fans than any other actor in the movie-mostly because he's not a classically trained singer, and his voice has a much rougher edge to it than most of the actors who have played the Phantom on Broadway. However, Butler is a stupendous actor and manages to convey the Phantom's pain and loneliness more effectively than any stage actor I've ever seen. And his untrained voice actually complements that raw pain and emotion.Christine is played by Emmy Rossum (The Day After Tomorrow, Mystic River). Rossum shows off a lovely soprano voice in the film. She's a little weak on some of the higher notes, but she's young, and her voice hasn't fully developed yet. Her acting, however, is excellent. She's consistently able to portray her conflicting fear and desire for the Phantom, and she seems genuinely torn between the Phantom and Raoul, played by Patrick Wilson.Wilson (Angels in America) was the first principal cast for the movie-and with good reason. He has a lovely voice, and he manages to give real depth to the normally thankless role of Raoul.Phantom also has a wonderful supporting cast. Special recognition, however, should go to Minnie Driver, who plays the opera diva, Carlotta. Her performance is hilarious, completely over-the-top, and thoroughly enjoyable.Beyond the individual performances, the music is beautiful (the singers are backed by a 100-piece orchestra, which you'll never get in live theatre), the sets are breathtaking, and the costumes are absolutely stunning. The eye and ear candy alone make this DVD worth buying, but the special features are also a lot of fun.

889829,A39FJV2G99WGQI,B0007TKNI8,Anibeth,"[2, 6]","I prefer the Original London Cast to the recently released movie version of the Phantom of the Opera. While the singing by Meg certainly is even much better than the London Cast version for her 'immature' or 'childlike' singing, the movie version defeats the purpose where Christine is forced to compete with Meg for the starring role. While Emmy Rossum's voice sounded more fuller in body comparable to Sarah Brightman's angelic singing, Emmy Rossum's robust voice outshines the title role by the Phantom, as played by Gerard Butler. The voice of Butler's while excellent in acting, which was his powerful role yet, fell flat in his voice as compared to Michael Crawford's superior, and yet, powerful, seductive and emotional range of voice techniques. Crawford would have been better chosen for the movie role if he had reprised his role in his favor over Butler's. Butler's acting voice while powerful, and raw, show very little emotion and flexibility that Crawford exhibited during his powerful performance in the London stage version of the Phantom of the Opera. The exception to this flaw was the very poor performance of Carlotta as sung by Minnie Driver. I feel that Minnie Driver would make a fine actress and less of a singer because her voice is not too flexible in power, is quite harsh, and less fluid and refined like Rosemary Ashe who did have a starring role as Carlotta in the London version. Patrick Wilson, was very impressive as the Vicompte Raoul de Chagny. He might have a better future in a musical film than Butler's whose voice was less than pure comparable to Michael Crawford's. I think that Michael Crawford would have a better chance in performing the role of the Phantom, had he been chosen over Butler.The film was less interesting and less exciting, other than the fight scene, though I would prefer to see the Phantom throw flaming skulls rather than using the sword like a typical swordsman. Other non-magical scenes such as his revealing disappearance defeats the mystery of how the Phantom disappears when shown during the somewhat-colorful Mascarade scene.Overall, while some scenes were interesting to view, most of them were unnecessary, jarring and cluttered with clumsily made plots, special effects that were not too mysterious, but too revealing and some acting, while good in one portion of the film, was not a definite plus over the highly rated Original casting of Phantom of the Opera.While I do recommend people to see the movie version of the Phantom of the Opera, the film's awkwardness and cluttered presentation  made possible by the producers, and directors, will continued to be outshined by the best rated Original London musical.To prove it, why not listen to the cd of the Phantom of the Opera, Original London cast to find out for yourself how beautiful and inspiring it really is.",3,Movie not good enough to be ranked a five star,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,2840,"['prefer', 'Original', 'London', 'Cast', 'recently', 'released', 'movie', 'version', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'singing', 'Meg', 'certainly', 'even', 'much', 'better', 'London', 'Cast', 'version', ""'immature"", 'singing', 'movie', 'version', 'purpose', 'where', 'Christine', 'forced', 'compete', 'Meg', 'starring', 'role', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'voice', 'sounded', 'more', 'fuller', 'body', 'comparable', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'angelic', 'singing', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'robust', 'voice', 'title', 'role', 'Phantom', 'played', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'voice', 'Butler', 'while', 'excellent', 'acting', 'was', 'powerful', 'role', 'yet', 'fell', 'flat', 'voice', 'compared', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'superior', 'yet', 'powerful', 'seductive', 'emotional', 'range', 'voice', 'techniques', 'Crawford', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'chosen', 'movie', 'role', 'had', 'reprised', 'role', 'favor', 'Butler', 'Butler', 'acting', 'voice', 'powerful', 'raw', 'show', 'very', 'little', 'emotion', 'flexibility', 'Crawford', 'exhibited', 'powerful', 'performance', 'London', 'stage', 'version', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'exception', 'flaw', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'performance', 'Carlotta', 'sung', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'feel', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'would', 'make', 'fine', 'actress', 'less', 'singer', 'voice', 'not', 'too', 'flexible', 'power', 'quite', 'harsh', 'less', 'fluid', 'refined', 'Rosemary', 'Ashe', 'who', 'did', 'have', 'starring', 'role', 'Carlotta', 'London', 'version', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'Vicompte', 'Raoul', 'Chagny', 'might', 'have', 'better', 'future', 'musical', 'film', 'Butler', 'voice', 'was', 'less', 'pure', 'comparable', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'think', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'chance', 'performing', 'role', 'Phantom', 'had', 'been', 'chosen', 'Butler.The', 'film', 'was', 'less', 'interesting', 'less', 'exciting', 'other', 'fight', 'scene', 'would', 'prefer', 'see', 'Phantom', 'throw', 'flaming', 'skulls', 'rather', 'using', 'sword', 'typical', 'swordsman', 'Other', 'non-magical', 'scenes', 'such', 'revealing', 'disappearance', 'mystery', 'how', 'Phantom', 'disappears', 'when', 'shown', 'somewhat-colorful', 'Mascarade', 'scene.Overall', 'scenes', 'were', 'interesting', 'view', 'most', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'jarring', 'cluttered', 'clumsily', 'made', 'plots', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'not', 'too', 'mysterious', 'too', 'revealing', 'acting', 'good', 'one', 'portion', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'definite', 'highly', 'rated', 'Original', 'casting', 'Phantom', 'Opera.While', 'do', 'recommend', 'people', 'see', 'movie', 'version', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'film', 'awkwardness', 'cluttered', 'presentation', 'made', 'possible', 'producers', 'directors', 'will', 'continued', 'be', 'outshined', 'best', 'rated', 'Original', 'London', 'musical.To', 'why', 'not', 'listen', 'cd', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Original', 'London', 'cast', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'really']",N/A

But I'm glad I didn't miss it because Joel Schumacher's ""Phantom of the Opera"" is simply one of the best movies of 2004 (together with ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Collateral"") and deserves loads of nominations come Oscar time. It's a splendid, no-expense spared production and features a first-rate cast and the most beautiful of costumes and set decoration.The 3 lead actors, Gerald Butler (as the Phantom), Emmy Rossum (Christine) and Patrick Wilson (Raoul) are brilliant in their respective role and (guess what?) they could really sing!! Their voice is sheer perfection. Gerald's is suitably strong and passionate while Patrick's will make you fall in love with Raoul. As for Emmy, she sings most 'dolce' and has to be the best 'Christine' ever (she could give any WestEnd ""Christines"" a run for their money with her beauty and vocal talent). Her performance is unforgetable and I simply love her crystal-clear voice (especially in the song ""Think of Me"").Some of the most magnificent scenes:1. in the beginning, when the broken chandelier is 'raised' to the accompaniment of the musical's powerful Overture.2. the Phantom leading Christine to his secret lair as the theme song is sung.3. the spectacular fall of the chandelier towards the end of the film.There is no doubt that this film is a labor of love from the producer/songwriter, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the director, Joel Schumacher. If there's fairness in the movieworld, this film will receive a Best Picture nomination and Gerald and Emmy will both get Best Acting noms at the coming Oscars. To me, ""Phantom of the Opera"" is far more enjoyable, romantic and beautiful to watch than the other 2 musicals that came out in the past few years (i.e. ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago"" which did well at the Oscars, but trust me that ""Phantom of the Opera"" is superior to those two in every aspect and it certainly has far more memorable songs!).This film is a true feast for the senses. Just sit back and let the drama, color and  music 'wash' over you. You'll leave the theatre in love all over again with Andrew Lloyd Webber's music (as I was, especially with the Phantom's signature tune, ""Angel of Music"", ""Think of Me"", ""All I Ask of You"" and ""Music of the Night"").",5,Spectacular!,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,2336,"['Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'reading', 'mixed', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2004', 'together', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'Collateral', 'loads', 'nominations', 'come', 'Oscar', 'time', 'splendid', 'no-expense', 'spared', 'production', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'most', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'set', 'decoration.The', '3', 'lead', 'actors', 'Gerald', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Christine', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Raoul', 'are', 'brilliant', 'respective', 'role', 'guess', 'what', 'could', 'really', 'sing', 'voice', 'sheer', 'perfection', 'Gerald', 'suitably', 'strong', 'passionate', 'Patrick', 'will', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'Raoul', 'Emmy', 'most', 'be', 'best', ""'Christine"", 'ever', 'could', 'give', 'WestEnd', 'Christines', 'run', 'money', 'beauty', 'vocal', 'talent', 'performance', 'unforgetable', 'simply', 'love', 'crystal-clear', 'voice', 'especially', 'song', 'Think', 'Me', '.Some', 'most', 'magnificent', 'scenes:1.', 'beginning', 'when', 'broken', 'chandelier', ""'raised"", 'accompaniment', 'musical', 'powerful', 'Overture.2', 'Phantom', 'leading', 'Christine', 'secret', 'lair', 'theme', 'song', 'sung.3', 'spectacular', 'fall', 'chandelier', 'end', 'film.There', 'doubt', 'film', 'labor', 'love', 'producer/songwriter', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'fairness', 'movieworld', 'film', 'will', 'receive', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'Gerald', 'Emmy', 'will', 'get', 'Best', 'Acting', 'noms', 'coming', 'Oscars', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'romantic', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'other', '2', 'musicals', 'came', 'out', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'i.e', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Chicago', 'did', 'well', 'Oscars', 'trust', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'superior', 'two', 'aspect', 'certainly', 'far', 'more', 'memorable', 'songs', '.This', 'film', 'true', 'feast', 'senses', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'drama', 'color', 'music', ""'wash"", ""'ll"", 'leave', 'theatre', 'love', 'over', 'again', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'music', 'was', 'especially', 'Phantom', 'signature', 'tune', 'Angel', 'Music', 'Think', 'Me', 'Ask', 'Music', 'Night']",N/A

So I said, sure and rented this movie along with Lemony Snicket.Well, I have to say that I was VERY disappointed. Usually when I finish watching a movie, I either instantly LOVE it or instantly Hate it, especially those movies which are not just for entertainment purposes. So after watching Phantom, I'll have to say I didn't like it. I thought about why I didn't like it all day and finally I'm set to writing this review.The Plot: let's see...beautiful but dumb and simple female main character; love at first sight with no development what-so-ever; and no matter how much they try to stress the whole comparison between the inwardness of human beings to the outwardness of human beings, they still come back to ""judge a book by its cover please"". That's how I felt about the plot, so incredibly cliche with almost no new ideas at all. The whole love triangle is pretty silly. I mean, the phantom has endured mistreatment for his whole entire life because of his face, he's shocked about Christine not falling for him??? So yeah, ya'll gonna say, well he has rage within him. But that just proves how cliche the story is.So okay, let's not talk about the plot anymore, since it is written in eariler time, people are stupid and close-minded in eariler time. let's just talk about the movie itself. Well, I think I would like the movie much better if it weren't a musical. The musical of the movie is just soooo incredibly awkward. I think it's because phantom is like a mystery, but singing is to reveal, and since they don't want to reveal too much, the singing is just repeats and repeats. The conversation in singing is awkward too, I mean, the phantom was swearing while still singing like when he sing ""damn you! damn you!"" geez, awkward!The music itself was provocative, but it's been ruined by cheesy lyrics. if you are familiar with Lemony Snicket, you know that it's a very cheesy movie. But alot of the lines in Lemony Snicket matches Phantom with its tone. such as in Lemony Snicket: Children, I am your beloved Count Olaf; you then look at phantom of the opera: Christine, I am your Angel of Music, sound familiar? that's right, they both have the ""ta da"" chessiness.The acting was mediocre. The character developments in Phantom have almost NO transition at all. I mean, after all the time with phantom, Christine NOW feels scared??? After all the time with phantom Christine suddenly falls for another man and that's that??? Christine kisses the phantom and just like that the phantom's evilness dissolves???? The acting wasn't bad, Emmy Rosumbum did pretty good as a new actress. But really, most of the goodies in the acting is just that they sing well. So yeah, Emmy can definitely sing. But if you just watch a movie to watch singing, I would rather buy CDs or download music.Overall, I really didn't like the movie, it's really rather boring. I heard the book was so much better that it makes more sense-that is, the motive of phantom's evilness makes more sense. so maybe I'll take a shot at that, but the movie really could use improvement.",3,disappointed,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,3167,"['Everyone', 'least', 'heard', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'sooooo', 'amazing', 'HAVE', 'go', 'see', 'said', 'sure', 'rented', 'movie', 'Lemony', 'Snicket.Well', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'VERY', 'disappointed', 'Usually', 'when', 'finish', 'watching', 'movie', 'either', 'instantly', 'LOVE', 'instantly', 'Hate', 'especially', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'So', 'watching', 'Phantom', ""'ll"", 'have', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'thought', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'day', 'finally', ""'m"", 'set', 'writing', 'review.The', 'Plot', 'let', 'see', 'beautiful', 'dumb', 'simple', 'female', 'main', 'character', 'first', 'sight', 'development', 'what-so-ever', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'try', 'stress', 'whole', 'comparison', 'inwardness', 'human', 'beings', 'outwardness', 'human', 'beings', 'still', 'come', 'back', 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'please', 'how', 'felt', 'plot', 'so', 'incredibly', 'cliche', 'almost', 'new', 'ideas', 'whole', 'love', 'triangle', 'pretty', 'silly', 'mean', 'phantom', 'endured', 'mistreatment', 'whole', 'entire', 'life', 'face', 'shocked', 'Christine', 'not', 'falling', 'So', 'yeah', ""'ll"", 'gon', 'na', 'say', 'well', 'rage', 'just', 'how', 'cliche', 'story', 'is.So', 'okay', 'let', 'not', 'talk', 'plot', 'anymore', 'written', 'eariler', 'time', 'people', 'are', 'stupid', 'close-minded', 'eariler', 'time', 'let', 'just', 'talk', 'movie', 'Well', 'think', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'were', ""n't"", 'musical', 'musical', 'movie', 'just', 'soooo', 'incredibly', 'awkward', 'think', 'phantom', 'mystery', 'singing', 'reveal', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'singing', 'just', 'repeats', 'repeats', 'conversation', 'singing', 'awkward', 'too', 'mean', 'phantom', 'was', 'swearing', 'still', 'singing', 'when', 'sing', 'damn', 'damn', 'geez', 'awkward', 'music', 'was', 'provocative', 'been', 'ruined', 'cheesy', 'lyrics', 'are', 'familiar', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'know', 'very', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'alot', 'lines', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'matches', 'Phantom', 'tone', 'such', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'Children', 'am', 'beloved', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'then', 'look', 'phantom', 'opera', 'Christine', 'am', 'Angel', 'Music', 'sound', 'familiar', 'right', 'have', 'ta', 'da', 'chessiness.The', 'acting', 'was', 'mediocre', 'character', 'developments', 'Phantom', 'have', 'almost', 'transition', 'mean', 'time', 'phantom', 'Christine', 'NOW', 'scared', 'time', 'phantom', 'Christine', 'suddenly', 'man', 'Christine', 'phantom', 'just', 'phantom', 'evilness', 'dissolves', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Emmy', 'Rosumbum', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'new', 'actress', 'really', 'most', 'goodies', 'acting', 'just', 'sing', 'well', 'So', 'yeah', 'Emmy', 'can', 'definitely', 'sing', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'watch', 'singing', 'would', 'rather', 'buy', 'CDs', 'download', 'music.Overall', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'really', 'rather', 'boring', 'heard', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'sense-that', 'motive', 'phantom', 'evilness', 'more', 'sense', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'take', 'shot', 'movie', 'really', 'could', 'use', 'improvement']",N/A

The music is as beautiful as ever (""All I Ask of You"", ""Music of the Night"" ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again""), acting and singing is very decent, not detracting from the overall romantic and mysterious mood, and - perhaps the most typical for the film is its lavish, almost vain, production. You bet it must have suited Mr Webber, known for his perfectionism, fine. The only setback is that the film came perhaps a little too late in time. Had it come a decade or two earlier (maybe when Webber's then-wife Sarah Brightman's crossover career was in its prime), it would have scored higher critical success and more of the deserved awards.

889847,A1X1N1RHFIOCRF,B0007TKNI8,arthistoryguy,"[5, 8]","Having never seen the musical performed on stage (and knowing only bits and pieces of the story) I was eager to see the original Andrew Lloyd Webber songs and storyline played out on screen.  I had to know what the hype was about -- after all, it's the most recognized musical in history.  I know the songs far better than I know what the songs are about.While it is a rare double-threat to be a great actor and singer at the same time, it's not impossible (I.E. Julie Andrews, Barbara Streisand, Liza Minnelli).  I kept thinking, as I watched, that there must have been a tremendous amount of pressure placed upon the filmmakers to cast an artist who can do both, and do both well.  Here, the creators seem to have opted more for the acting slant versus vocal ability -- and I agree that was, perhaps, the better of the two talents to emphasize in the film version.  Still, I can't help but think there might be a perfect young Christine out there waiting to be inserted into this production, and certainly there is an actor/singer who could hit the Phantom's notes without a rather annoying rustic, country-rock squalor?Emmy Rossum, the actress who takes on the role of Christine here (whom you may remember from ""The Day After Tomorrow"") is a decent performer with a history in musical productions.  She can sing fine (though I find it hard-pressed to call her a possible opera star, unlike Sarah Brightman for whom the role was penned in 1985 by then-husband Webber).  She doesn't sing strongly enough to make me believe that she could command an Opera stage.  Gerard Butler, who plays the Phantom, seems like a melodramatic resident from Melrose Place who decided he would like to start a rock band, but opted to live like a recluse in an Opera House's basement and somehow  train pretty young girls to sing like, well, Sarah Brightman.  Strange casting in the role of the Phantom, as much as I enjoy Butler's other work.  Patrick Wilson, who plays Christine's legitimate love-interest, belts his songs out fine, if not dry and uninspired.  This is a film that makes the concept of real singers singing the parts and then real actors mouthing those pre-recorded tracks seem like a better idea; everything music-wise is a tinge too mediocre.  It's as if a decent filmmaker is attempting to produce an album.The cinematography shines.  It's a beautiful film... most of the time.  The sweeping camera shots, warm, vibrant colors, spectacular sets and costumes, and antique French charm is often entrancing.  The Paris opera scene comes to vivacious life.  Yet, the cumbersome black and white flash-forward scenes are treated with as much emotional depth as a Madonna or Prince music video from the 1980's.  It's when we're at the stage, back stage, and in the audience of the opera house -- watching elegant fake elephants trot across the stage and chandeliers crash to the ground in a fiery blaze -- that the movie comes together in the finest way.If you're a die-hard fan of the stage musical I can't imagine that you'll be terribly blown away with this big-screen interpretation.  If you're curious as to what story fits the fantastic original Webber tunes, you might like to check this one out on DVD.Grade: C",3,A sometimes pretty & somtimes bland soap Opera,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,3215,"['Having', 'never', 'seen', 'musical', 'performed', 'stage', 'knowing', 'only', 'bits', 'pieces', 'story', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'original', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'songs', 'storyline', 'played', 'out', 'screen', 'had', 'know', 'what', 'hype', 'was', 'about', 'most', 'recognized', 'musical', 'history', 'know', 'songs', 'far', 'better', 'know', 'what', 'songs', 'are', 'rare', 'double-threat', 'be', 'great', 'actor', 'singer', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'impossible', 'I.E', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'kept', 'thinking', 'watched', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'pressure', 'placed', 'filmmakers', 'cast', 'artist', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'do', 'well', 'Here', 'creators', 'seem', 'have', 'opted', 'more', 'acting', 'slant', 'versus', 'vocal', 'ability', 'agree', 'was', 'perhaps', 'better', 'two', 'talents', 'emphasize', 'film', 'version', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'perfect', 'young', 'Christine', 'there', 'waiting', 'be', 'inserted', 'production', 'certainly', 'actor/singer', 'who', 'could', 'hit', 'Phantom', 'notes', 'rather', 'annoying', 'rustic', 'country-rock', 'squalor', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'actress', 'who', 'role', 'Christine', 'here', 'whom', 'may', 'remember', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'decent', 'performer', 'history', 'musical', 'productions', 'can', 'sing', 'fine', 'find', 'hard-pressed', 'call', 'possible', 'opera', 'star', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'whom', 'role', 'was', 'penned', '1985', 'then-husband', 'Webber', ""n't"", 'sing', 'strongly', 'enough', 'make', 'believe', 'could', 'command', 'Opera', 'stage', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'who', 'Phantom', 'melodramatic', 'resident', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'who', 'decided', 'would', 'like', 'start', 'rock', 'band', 'opted', 'live', 'recluse', 'Opera', 'House', 'basement', 'somehow', 'train', 'pretty', 'young', 'girls', 'sing', 'well', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Strange', 'casting', 'role', 'Phantom', 'as', 'much', 'enjoy', 'Butler', 'other', 'work', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'who', 'Christine', 'legitimate', 'love-interest', 'belts', 'songs', 'out', 'fine', 'not', 'dry', 'uninspired', 'film', 'concept', 'real', 'singers', 'singing', 'parts', 'then', 'real', 'actors', 'mouthing', 'pre-recorded', 'tracks', 'seem', 'better', 'idea', 'everything', 'music-wise', 'tinge', 'too', 'mediocre', 'decent', 'filmmaker', 'attempting', 'produce', 'album.The', 'cinematography', 'shines', 'beautiful', 'film', 'most', 'time', 'sweeping', 'camera', 'shots', 'warm', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'spectacular', 'sets', 'costumes', 'antique', 'French', 'charm', 'often', 'entrancing', 'Paris', 'opera', 'scene', 'vivacious', 'life', 'cumbersome', 'black', 'white', 'flash-forward', 'scenes', 'are', 'treated', 'as', 'much', 'emotional', 'depth', 'Madonna', 'Prince', 'music', 'video', '1980', 'when', ""'re"", 'stage', 'back', 'stage', 'audience', 'opera', 'house', 'watching', 'elegant', 'fake', 'elephants', 'trot', 'stage', 'chandeliers', 'crash', 'ground', 'fiery', 'blaze', 'movie', 'together', 'finest', 'way.If', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'fan', 'stage', 'musical', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', ""'ll"", 'be', 'terribly', 'blown', 'away', 'big-screen', 'interpretation', ""'re"", 'curious', 'what', 'story', 'fantastic', 'original', 'Webber', 'tunes', 'might', 'like', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'DVD.Grade', 'C']",N/A

889851,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0007TKNI8,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","This is going to be a little different from my usual reviews, because I have been reading the book and then just got the movie. I haven't quite finished the book yet, but I can already tell you that the movie is more ""based on"" than really telling the same story.This is a stunning movie visually, and probably would be musically if my audio equipment was up to par. I was frustrated by not being able to understand the spoken word enough to be sure when they were talking and when singing. I think it is just because my headphones are pathetic, but it may be something more. Since this is almost an opera itself, it partakes of one of the problems I have always had with opera: I can seldom understand what they are saying, even when they sing in English. This is English, I can catch enough words to know that, but I had to do a lot of lip-reading and inferring from my knowledge of the story.Still, it is remarkable how much I was able to appreciate in spite of that problem. A lovely device at the outset of the movie and used periodically afterward is the way they switch back and forth between 1919 (I believe it is) and 188?, when the main part of the story took place. The part where the Opera House is in ruins and the old man in a wheelchair is remembering are in black and white, although some red gets in at times. Then as the auctioneer has the drop cloth pulled off the huge crystal chandelier, it begins to rise to its original position, throw off its gray dust and it becomes lit up again. As it rises, the whole theater gradually sweeps into color back in its former gilded age, and there we are in the past.The movie eliminated one fascinating character I had hoped to see, which is the Persian. Part of his role is absorbed into the dancers' mother, who is an employee of the Opera. Her daughter is a charming little blond and apparently Christine's closest friend. Christine (Emmy Rossum) is the very beautiful and under-appreciated soprano who takes over for the prima donna when she is sabotaged by the Phantom. The Phantom (Gerard Butler) is actually a human being, more or less, and has been giving Christine singing lessons invisibly by way of a pleasant little legend Christine's violinist father had told her about the Angel of Music. He pretends to be the Angel and trains Christine by hiding from her and therefore giving her the impression he is non-material and invisible. In fact, he's just horribly disfigured and wears a mask. The book and the movie disagree on how he became disfigured, so I won't meddle with that.The Phantom (named Erik in the book, but I don't recall that his name was ever used in the movie) lives in his own little world beneath the Opera house, in cellars and passageways that are partly involved in the functions of the theater, such as trap doors and heaters, and partly the result of the way the opera house was built on top of excavations that were used by the Commune as a prison during the revolution. He's fitted it all up with luxurious trappings, thousands of candles, his own miniature stage set on which he arranges operas with dolls, and a huge pipe organ.There is complexity to the Phantom's romancing of Christine in the form of Raoul, Vicomte de Chagney, a childhood friend of Christine's who renews contact with her after her first great triumph. He's young, handsome, titled, charming in every way, and falls completely in love with Christine. Or perhaps rekindles an old love for her. In any case Erik, the Phantom, sees him as a rival for the soprano's affection, and he does not play fair.I'll leave it to the movie to show you just how unfairly he can play. But then read the book, and compare. In my opinion, the book depicts much more macabre and inventive punishments for Erik's rival.No, of course I won't tell you the outcome. As to who wins, I figure that's the audience.",4,"A Simply Beautiful Movie -- No, a Complex Beautiful Movie",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,3856,"['going', 'be', 'little', 'different', 'usual', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'book', 'then', 'just', 'got', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'finished', 'book', 'yet', 'can', 'already', 'tell', 'movie', 'more', 'based', 'really', 'telling', 'same', 'story.This', 'stunning', 'movie', 'visually', 'probably', 'would', 'be', 'musically', 'audio', 'equipment', 'was', 'up', 'par', 'was', 'frustrated', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'understand', 'spoken', 'word', 'enough', 'be', 'sure', 'when', 'were', 'talking', 'when', 'singing', 'think', 'just', 'headphones', 'are', 'pathetic', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'almost', 'opera', 'one', 'problems', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'opera', 'can', 'seldom', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'even', 'when', 'sing', 'English', 'English', 'can', 'catch', 'enough', 'words', 'know', 'had', 'do', 'lot', 'lip-reading', 'inferring', 'knowledge', 'story.Still', 'remarkable', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'able', 'appreciate', 'spite', 'problem', 'lovely', 'device', 'outset', 'movie', 'used', 'periodically', 'afterward', 'way', 'switch', 'back', 'forth', '1919', 'believe', '188', 'when', 'main', 'part', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'part', 'where', 'Opera', 'House', 'ruins', 'old', 'man', 'wheelchair', 'remembering', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'red', 'times', 'Then', 'auctioneer', 'drop', 'cloth', 'pulled', 'off', 'huge', 'crystal', 'chandelier', 'rise', 'original', 'position', 'throw', 'off', 'gray', 'dust', 'lit', 'up', 'again', 'whole', 'theater', 'gradually', 'color', 'back', 'former', 'gilded', 'age', 'are', 'past.The', 'movie', 'eliminated', 'one', 'fascinating', 'character', 'had', 'hoped', 'see', 'Persian', 'Part', 'role', 'absorbed', 'dancers', 'mother', 'who', 'employee', 'Opera', 'daughter', 'charming', 'little', 'blond', 'apparently', 'Christine', 'closest', 'friend', 'Christine', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'very', 'beautiful', 'under-appreciated', 'soprano', 'who', 'prima', 'donna', 'when', 'sabotaged', 'Phantom', 'Phantom', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'actually', 'human', 'being', 'more', 'less', 'been', 'giving', 'Christine', 'singing', 'lessons', 'invisibly', 'way', 'pleasant', 'little', 'legend', 'Christine', 'violinist', 'father', 'had', 'told', 'Angel', 'Music', 'be', 'Angel', 'trains', 'Christine', 'hiding', 'therefore', 'giving', 'impression', 'non-material', 'invisible', 'fact', 'just', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'mask', 'book', 'movie', 'disagree', 'how', 'became', 'disfigured', 'wo', ""n't"", 'meddle', 'that.The', 'Phantom', 'named', 'Erik', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'name', 'was', 'ever', 'used', 'movie', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'Opera', 'house', 'cellars', 'passageways', 'are', 'partly', 'involved', 'functions', 'theater', 'such', 'trap', 'doors', 'heaters', 'partly', 'result', 'way', 'opera', 'house', 'was', 'built', 'top', 'excavations', 'were', 'used', 'Commune', 'prison', 'revolution', 'fitted', 'up', 'luxurious', 'trappings', 'thousands', 'candles', 'own', 'miniature', 'stage', 'set', 'operas', 'dolls', 'huge', 'pipe', 'complexity', 'Phantom', 'romancing', 'Christine', 'form', 'Raoul', 'Vicomte', 'de', 'Chagney', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Christine', 'who', 'contact', 'first', 'great', 'triumph', 'young', 'handsome', 'titled', 'charming', 'way', 'completely', 'love', 'Christine', 'perhaps', 'old', 'love', 'case', 'Erik', 'Phantom', 'rival', 'soprano', 'affection', 'not', 'play', 'fair.I', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'movie', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'unfairly', 'can', 'play', 'then', 'read', 'book', 'compare', 'opinion', 'book', 'much', 'more', 'macabre', 'inventive', 'punishments', 'Erik', 'rival.No', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'outcome', 'who', 'figure', 'audience']",N/A

I'm giving it 3 stars [well maybe 3 1/2] just because I like the originally story but seriously quite a few things are wrong with this musical film.Okay, I'm not a music expert but I truly don't get it when a lot of reviewers here said the actors/ actresses voice was great. I have a set of Phantom CDs and even with my uneducated ears, I can tell you that what was sung in the film isn't even close. It's just mediocre.  Also, I once saw Phantom on a London's stage and even though it was years ago I still remember I got goosebumps all through my sitting. For this musical film, not even once I got that kind of feeling. That BAD!Another thing, what's with the leading actress? She's got a sweet face all right but she can't act and she has ZERO screen presence. I think if the singing is going to just passable like this, it would have been much better to use a famous actress, one whom you can't help but look at in awe and admiration.. at least the whole watching experience would be much more interesting. Both male actors are somewhat tepid too. Hmm..And on top of that, if you are going to make a bad imitation of a famous musical, why not give it your all like they did with Chicago. Who knows.. the flashy factors might have helped offset the weakness of this musical film.Well, to sum it up, I'm disappointed. Must be because I expected too much.PS: I still don't understand how it is possible for anyone who has seen a stage version of Phantom to give this quite bad musical film a five.",3,Disappointing,1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,1603,"['Well', 'do', 'musicals', 'lot', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'one', 'big', 'screen', 'so', 'rented', 'DVD', 'instead', ""'m"", 'giving', '3', 'stars', '[', 'well', 'maybe', '3', '1/2', ']', 'just', 'like', 'originally', 'story', 'seriously', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'wrong', 'musical', 'film.Okay', ""'m"", 'not', 'music', 'expert', 'truly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'when', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'here', 'said', 'actors/', 'voice', 'was', 'great', 'have', 'set', 'Phantom', 'CDs', 'even', 'uneducated', 'ears', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'sung', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'just', 'mediocre', 'Also', 'once', 'saw', 'Phantom', 'London', 'stage', 'even', 'was', 'years', 'still', 'remember', 'got', 'goosebumps', 'sitting', 'musical', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'once', 'got', 'kind', 'feeling', 'BAD', 'thing', 'what', 'leading', 'actress', 'got', 'sweet', 'face', 'right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'ZERO', 'screen', 'presence', 'think', 'singing', 'going', 'just', 'passable', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'use', 'famous', 'actress', 'one', 'whom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'look', 'awe', 'admiration..', 'least', 'whole', 'watching', 'experience', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'male', 'actors', 'are', 'somewhat', 'tepid', 'too', 'Hmm..And', 'top', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'bad', 'imitation', 'famous', 'musical', 'why', 'not', 'give', 'did', 'Chicago', 'Who', 'knows..', 'flashy', 'factors', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'offset', 'weakness', 'musical', 'film.Well', 'sum', 'up', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'Must', 'be', 'expected', 'too', 'much.PS', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'possible', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'stage', 'version', 'Phantom', 'give', 'quite', 'bad', 'musical', 'film', 'five']",N/A
889857,A44L1371VP728,B0007TKNI8,Ben Klenke,"[8, 9]","I must start this review by saying I am a ""Phan"". This is geek code for fans of the Phantom of the Opera. I 1st saw Phantom when I was in the 7th grade in Los Angeles. I later received the soundtrack on tape, and spent many many nights falling asleep to The Music of the Night. It is beautiful story set to gorgeous music.Let's get a few more things out of the way. I never believed that the Phantom role exists only in Michael Crawford. Gerard Butler does a smash up job as the masked man. What he lacks in vocal range he more than makes up in acting ability. He ain't to hard to look at either. Is there really any woman who could say no the Phantom after the Point of no Return sequence? Emmy Rossum was perfect as Christine. She especially embodied the innocence that Christine is made of.Let's talk changes:1. The chandelier falls at the end of Don Juan instead of at the end of All I ask of You. Verdict: A necessary change since the movie does not have an intermission. In the play it would not work. The film... Yes.2. The swordfight: the best change between the film and play. In the play the Phantom shoots a ""fireball""? from his staff at Raoul and Christine. The film changed this up with a rousing swordfight, that also greatly adds to Raoul's character development. I always felt we was way to wussified in the play and wondered why Christine even would want him in the 1st place. Verdict... Awesome3. The Phantom's origins: The play makes no mention of how the Phantom came to be in the Opera. We know that Madame Giry knows more than she should. The film goes into great detail of how The phantom was in a circus freak show and was rescued by Giry. It is not a necessary scene to the story, but does not detract from the flow, and does add more sympathy to the Phantom. Verdict... unnecessary, but not an issue.4. Raol and the water trap: In the play Raol makes his way to the Phantom's lair through the underground labyrinth with water. In the film he falls through a trap door into the water as a cage descends upon him. The only negative to this scene is it breaks the tension of the Phantom and Christine. Once again it no t needed but adds a bit more dramatic tension to Raol's character, even though everyone should know he'll get out somehow. It would have been impossible in the play. Verdict... same as above.This is a beautiful, fun filled, moving movie. The music has never sounded better, the staging is phenomenal, and the performances are dramatic and over the top, like any good musical should be. This is hands down the best movie musical since The Sound of Music.

If you are a musical lover, you will probably be disappointed-- even if you are a pop music lover, you will be also disappointed.For what we have here is singing basically in the way Julie Andrews's sang in The Sound of Music, but sung with a much flimsier voice far less musical ( or as another reviewer put it: ""wooden""). The singing does not sound like professional, whether as pop singer or classical singer: I have just revisited Miss Saigon where the singing have much in common and I must say the singing in Miss Saigon is so much better! Yet, there is singing all the time, almost from the beginning till the end...The way the story unfolds reminds me of ""Titanic"" but not quite as absorbing, and ""shallow"" was the word the Editorial Review used even though that could be an overstatement. Yet, the screen is always crowded in both the foreground and background. Worse of all, the film was seen through the Phantom's eyes, sapping much the sense of suspense and mystery. To make it up,  there are scenes of unnecessary violence unsuitable for small children...I wouldn't recommend it to those who love the two older versions or its variation ""The Red Shoes""-- for those who had not seen them could check them out themselves.

I was lucky enough to see it when it first hit Chicago years ago, and adored the music, the sets, everything.  So, I was prepared to enjoy a different version.  I'm not quite sure why it got so many lukewarm or cold reviews.  The settings are far more complicated than they were on stage (duh!  More room, more money, etc.), and I really loved the minimalist stage dressing.  The stage version was darkly lit (boy, is that an oxymoron!), with little fairy lights, whereas the movie version used fire and other light to turn everything bright.  They portrayed the Phantom's (whom I always call by his given name, which was revealed in one of the non-musical film versions) interior darkness by associating red with him, and not using in many scenes for anything else.  The film used a rather limited color palette -black, white, gold, red, with splashes of other colors.  The tunnels were all gray with torches providing the illumination and green water.  Very cool.The singing was ... not quite up to Broadway/Opera.  The man playing Eric was very good, but the hero was so-so.  Christine's voice was very modern, wispy, almost ethereal, quite like many women who sing Celtic music, not really up to the operatic potential of Lloyd Weber's music, but it worked.  There were several new songs, which were welcome, since my memory of the stage version was that it had one melody used over and over.  The whole film felt much more operatic than it did on stage.  Minimal talking.  They minimized Eric's deformities by giving him mild neurofibromatosis -He actually looked pretty decent, and I think that it would be possible for him to go outside without too many stares and comments, certainly less than poor Richard Merrick had to endure.  They also created a backstory to show how his psyche had been broken as a child, making him all the more pitiable.All in all, a really good movie, no matter what the professional critics had to say.

889872,AAJTZPX7HDE5U,B0007TKNI8,Brian J Hay,"[3, 4]","""Phantom"" always had all the ingredients in place to become a good film. Action scenes can (and invariably are-sorry, but singers are usually lousy stuntmen) be done better on film than on live stage. The duel between Raoul and the Phantom is a good example of that. It's as good as many of the best duel sequences ever filmed. Special Effects benefit as well. The special effects it used for the stage productions were the best that could be done in a live performance. The film medium offers numerous opportunities to do more while still working in the service of the narrative though. Joel Schumacher takes those opportunities and uses them tastefully. The sequence where Raoul encounters the Phantom in the hall of mirrors is done very well. The scene where Christine sings ""Wishing You Were Here Again"" is one of the crowning moments of the film.Problems that plagued the stage production still exist in the film though. Not all of the music is great. The duet between the two managers (Simon Callow and Victor McGuire) seemed so much like something Gilbert and Sullivan would have written that one of them should have announced that he was a ""Modern Major-General"". Combining musical dialogue with the spoken word is a risky proposition at best and the stage production didn't always manage to do it spotlessly. The film doesn't either. The ""method"" used to provide Christine with a chance to sing is perfect. The transition between rehearsal singing and doing so with full orchestral backing is flawless. Watching Raoul charge down a flight of stairs in full voice knocks the scene on its ear. There are other instances where people seem to be singing when they should be speaking (or vice versa) as well. The build-up to ""All I Ask of You"" seems like music that's missing part of its arrangement.These are minor complaints alongside the film as a whole though. Some of the music is among the most appealing to come out of the last century. As a composer Webber's been accused of being overblown and excessive but the fact remains that his work touches hearts very deeply and keeps doing so. His critics may just be jealous. The sets, lighting and photography are fabulous. The story moves along briskly and there are some moments of genuine suspense, no small feat considering that most people who will see this film already know the outcome. The most poignant moments will touch the feelings of all but the most heartless (everyone else will be pausing to dry their eyes). The performances are generally very good.Patrick Wilson doesn't really make much of an impression as Raoul but that's probably because the character was never really given much depth to begin with. Minnie Driver gets most the laughs with her over-the-top performance as (what has to be) the most vain Prima Donna in history. What she doesn't wring from viewers Simon Callow and Victor McGuire (Andre and Piangi) will. Miranda Richardson is wonderfully understated as Madame Giry, the woman who holds the secret of the Phantom. Gerard Butler's voice seems a little harsh at times (especially when he barks out a note instead of singing it) but he plays the part of the tormented Phantom magnificently. His rage is fearsome and his ruthlessness chilling but the beauty enshrouded in his torment is a thing of wonder. Anyone who's ever felt any sense of loneliness at any time will identify with this character.Webber wrote all of the best music from this show for Sarah Brightman (including ""The Music of the Night""-anyone who doesn't believe that should listen to her sing it) and it's a bond she still cherishes. She intertwines with this music as if it was a lover, bathes it with her heart and passion and releases it with a huge part of herself inside whenever she performs it. Everyone involved, audience and orchestra alike, end up in the web. It's impossible to hear her do it and not be moved. Webber knew all of this when he picked Emmy Rossum for the role and he proved that his eye for talent is as sharp as it ever was. The girl is a marvel. She has a lovely voice, one that sounds frail and delicate but has a surprising amount of strength. Her interpretation of the music is her own, and it's valid on its own. She doesn't try to replace Brightman. That would be impossible anyway. What she's done is taken a torch passed to her by Webber and found her own way of carrying it.This is a very good film. But that was a given even before the completion of the project. Webber was on hand as a producer and he's nearly as strong in that area as he is as a composer. He wouldn't knowingly let his greatest triumph go to seed. It would have been a surprise if the film had turned out to be a dog.",5,"A Triumph, especially for Emmy Rossum",1115596800,"05 9, 2005",2005,4685,"['Phantom', 'always', 'had', 'ingredients', 'place', 'become', 'good', 'film', 'Action', 'scenes', 'can', 'invariably', 'are-sorry', 'singers', 'are', 'usually', 'lousy', 'stuntmen', 'be', 'done', 'better', 'film', 'live', 'stage', 'duel', 'Raoul', 'Phantom', 'good', 'example', 'as', 'good', 'many', 'best', 'duel', 'sequences', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Special', 'Effects', 'benefit', 'as', 'well', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'stage', 'productions', 'were', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'live', 'performance', 'film', 'medium', 'numerous', 'opportunities', 'do', 'more', 'still', 'working', 'service', 'narrative', 'though', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'opportunities', 'tastefully', 'sequence', 'where', 'Raoul', 'Phantom', 'hall', 'mirrors', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'scene', 'where', 'Christine', 'Wishing', 'Were', 'Here', 'Again', 'one', 'crowning', 'moments', 'film.Problems', 'plagued', 'stage', 'production', 'still', 'exist', 'film', 'Not', 'music', 'great', 'duet', 'two', 'managers', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Victor', 'McGuire', 'seemed', 'so', 'much', 'something', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'announced', 'was', 'Modern', 'Major-General', 'Combining', 'musical', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'word', 'risky', 'proposition', 'best', 'stage', 'production', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'manage', 'do', 'spotlessly', 'film', ""n't"", 'either', 'method', 'used', 'provide', 'Christine', 'chance', 'sing', 'perfect', 'transition', 'rehearsal', 'singing', 'doing', 'so', 'full', 'orchestral', 'backing', 'flawless', 'Watching', 'Raoul', 'charge', 'down', 'flight', 'stairs', 'full', 'voice', 'scene', 'ear', 'are', 'other', 'instances', 'where', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'singing', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'speaking', 'vice', 'versa', 'as', 'well', 'build-up', 'Ask', 'music', 'missing', 'part', 'arrangement.These', 'are', 'minor', 'complaints', 'film', 'whole', 'though', 'music', 'most', 'appealing', 'come', 'last', 'century', 'composer', 'Webber', 'been', 'accused', 'being', 'overblown', 'excessive', 'fact', 'work', 'touches', 'hearts', 'very', 'deeply', 'doing', 'so', 'critics', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'jealous', 'sets', 'lighting', 'photography', 'are', 'fabulous', 'story', 'moves', 'briskly', 'are', 'moments', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'small', 'feat', 'considering', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'already', 'know', 'outcome', 'most', 'poignant', 'moments', 'will', 'touch', 'feelings', 'most', 'heartless', 'everyone', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'pausing', 'dry', 'eyes', 'performances', 'are', 'generally', 'very', 'good.Patrick', 'Wilson', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'much', 'impression', 'Raoul', 'probably', 'character', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'given', 'much', 'depth', 'begin', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'most', 'laughs', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'be', 'most', 'vain', 'Prima', 'Donna', 'history', 'What', ""n't"", 'wring', 'viewers', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Victor', 'McGuire', 'Andre', 'Piangi', 'will', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'woman', 'who', 'secret', 'Phantom', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'voice', 'little', 'harsh', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'out', 'note', 'instead', 'singing', 'part', 'tormented', 'Phantom', 'magnificently', 'rage', 'fearsome', 'ruthlessness', 'chilling', 'beauty', 'enshrouded', 'torment', 'thing', 'wonder', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'felt', 'sense', 'loneliness', 'time', 'will', 'identify', 'character.Webber', 'wrote', 'best', 'music', 'show', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'including', 'Music', 'Night', '-anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'should', 'listen', 'sing', 'bond', 'still', 'cherishes', 'music', 'was', 'lover', 'heart', 'passion', 'huge', 'part', 'whenever', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'audience', 'orchestra', 'alike', 'end', 'up', 'web', 'impossible', 'hear', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'Webber', 'knew', 'when', 'picked', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'role', 'proved', 'eye', 'talent', 'as', 'sharp', 'ever', 'was', 'girl', 'marvel', 'lovely', 'voice', 'one', 'frail', 'delicate', 'surprising', 'amount', 'strength', 'interpretation', 'music', 'own', 'valid', 'own', ""n't"", 'try', 'replace', 'Brightman', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'anyway', 'What', 'done', 'taken', 'torch', 'passed', 'Webber', 'found', 'own', 'way', 'carrying', 'it.This', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'even', 'completion', 'project', 'Webber', 'was', 'hand', 'producer', 'nearly', 'as', 'strong', 'area', 'composer', 'would', ""n't"", 'knowingly', 'let', 'greatest', 'triumph', 'go', 'seed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'surprise', 'film', 'had', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'dog']",N/A
889873,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0007TKNI8,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[1, 3]","Nominated for 3 Academy Awards and 3 Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, The Phantom Of The Opera is one of the most talked about movies of 2004. Taking the smash commercial success of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production to the big screen is no easy task, but long-time Hollywood director Joel Schumacher is more than able to get the job done. He takes an otherwise poorly written screenplay (minus the awe of a live performance no less) and manages to thrill the audience with the visual aspects of a film chiefly intended to rehash a successful stage musical. The costumes and set are simply magnificent, and Art Director John Fenner (Raiders Of The Lost Ark) helps Schumacher put together a fabulous production that's well worth a movie-goer's time...The Phantom Of The Opera centers around a mysterious character who dwells underneath the Paris Opera House, imbibing himself on the music that emanates from above. Known as The Phantom (Gerard Butler), he wears a half-mask to cover the hideous facial scars that have plagued him since birth. A musical genius, the phantom is infatuated with the opera, and when he falls in love with the voice of a young chorus girl named Christine (Emmy Rossum - The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Mystic River (2003)), this love of the opera morphs into an outright obsession. The phantom provides Christine with one-on-one voice lessons, while during his spare time, he terrorizes the opera house in an effort to land his prot&eacute;g&eacute; the opera's leading role. When Christine finally rises to that position, however, she is reunited with childhood friend Raul (Patrick Wilson), and the two begin a torrid love affair. Vengeful and jealous, the phantom kidnaps Christine and holds her prisoner in his underground lair, and Raul is the only one who can save her...Onscreen, The Phantom Of The Opera is weak by the standards of a traditional film. The cast does its best to make the most of a screenplay peppered with rigid dialogue - a script designed to sell ""the music of the night"". The supposed magnetism between Christine and Raul is non-existent and not really believable. As such, the audience is forced into believing that the phantom (who, by contrast, is quite charismatic in this rendition) would end up playing second fiddle to a man who makes Al Gore seem animated. Overall, however, other aspects of the film make up for this flaw...Based on Gaston Leroux's 1925 novel of the same name, The Phantom Of The Opera loses much of its original edge given the phantom's transformation from a frightening and mangled lunatic to a watered down half-scarred/half-babe-magnet figure complete with likeable characteristics. But inevitably, that's the mark of an enduring franchise - its malleability in the realm of numerous genres and the public's willingness to embrace such changes. But arguably, the small changes in the original novel's plot were necessary to achieve Lloyd Webber's goal of a melodramatic and stirring Broadway musical boasting mass commercial appeal. In a year in which the Oscar nominations were mostly dominated by lower-budget, surprise hit films (such as Sideways, Million Dollar Baby, and Finding Neverland), The Phantom Of The Opera holds its own in many aspects (given its pre-production designation as a commercial success). But those who have not seen the stage version are unlikely to be won over to the ranks of the franchise's numerous fanatics. My advice is to definitely see the film if you've ever seen the stage performance or listened regularly to the soundtrack - otherwise, you might be disappointed. After all, no matter how good The Phantom Of The Opera translates to the big screen, there's a reason musicals are not the dominate genre in Hollywood...The DVD Report",4,5 stars if you love the stage musical...,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,3789,"['Nominated', '3', 'Academy', 'Awards', '3', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'including', 'Best', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Musical', 'Comedy', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'one', 'most', 'talked', 'movies', '2004', 'Taking', 'smash', 'commercial', 'success', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'stage', 'production', 'big', 'screen', 'easy', 'task', 'long-time', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'more', 'able', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'otherwise', 'poorly', 'written', 'screenplay', 'awe', 'live', 'performance', 'less', 'thrill', 'audience', 'visual', 'aspects', 'film', 'chiefly', 'intended', 'rehash', 'successful', 'stage', 'musical', 'costumes', 'set', 'are', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'Art', 'Director', 'John', 'Fenner', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'Schumacher', 'put', 'together', 'fabulous', 'production', 'well', 'worth', 'movie-goer', 'time', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'centers', 'mysterious', 'character', 'who', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'House', 'imbibing', 'music', 'Known', 'Phantom', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'half-mask', 'cover', 'hideous', 'facial', 'scars', 'have', 'plagued', 'birth', 'musical', 'genius', 'phantom', 'infatuated', 'opera', 'when', 'love', 'voice', 'young', 'chorus', 'girl', 'named', 'Christine', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', '2004', 'Mystic', 'River', '2003', 'love', 'opera', 'morphs', 'outright', 'obsession', 'phantom', 'Christine', 'one-on-one', 'voice', 'lessons', 'spare', 'time', 'opera', 'house', 'effort', 'land', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'opera', 'leading', 'role', 'When', 'Christine', 'finally', 'position', 'however', 'reunited', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Raul', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'two', 'begin', 'torrid', 'love', 'affair', 'Vengeful', 'jealous', 'phantom', 'Christine', 'prisoner', 'underground', 'lair', 'Raul', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'Onscreen', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'weak', 'standards', 'traditional', 'film', 'cast', 'best', 'make', 'most', 'screenplay', 'peppered', 'rigid', 'dialogue', 'script', 'designed', 'sell', 'music', 'night', 'supposed', 'magnetism', 'Christine', 'Raul', 'non-existent', 'not', 'really', 'believable', 'such', 'audience', 'forced', 'believing', 'phantom', 'who', 'contrast', 'quite', 'charismatic', 'rendition', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'playing', 'second', 'fiddle', 'man', 'who', 'Al', 'Gore', 'seem', 'animated', 'Overall', 'however', 'other', 'aspects', 'film', 'make', 'up', 'flaw', 'Based', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', '1925', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'much', 'original', 'edge', 'given', 'phantom', 'transformation', 'frightening', 'mangled', 'lunatic', 'watered', 'half-scarred/half-babe-magnet', 'figure', 'complete', 'likeable', 'characteristics', 'inevitably', 'mark', 'enduring', 'franchise', 'malleability', 'realm', 'numerous', 'genres', 'public', 'willingness', 'embrace', 'such', 'changes', 'arguably', 'small', 'changes', 'original', 'novel', 'plot', 'were', 'necessary', 'achieve', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'goal', 'melodramatic', 'stirring', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'boasting', 'mass', 'commercial', 'appeal', 'year', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'were', 'mostly', 'dominated', 'lower-budget', 'surprise', 'hit', 'films', 'such', 'Sideways', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'own', 'many', 'aspects', 'given', 'pre-production', 'designation', 'commercial', 'success', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'stage', 'version', 'are', 'unlikely', 'be', 'won', 'ranks', 'franchise', 'numerous', 'fanatics', 'advice', 'definitely', 'see', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'stage', 'performance', 'listened', 'regularly', 'soundtrack', 'otherwise', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'big', 'screen', 'reason', 'musicals', 'are', 'not', 'dominate', 'genre', 'Hollywood', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

889876,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0007TKNI8,Byron Kolln,"[9, 15]","Joel Schumacher's film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a perfect testemant to what has become the most successful stage production of all time.  Though many people are still wondering why the film wasn't made with it's original stage leads Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, the energetic young cast featured add their own magic to the gothic love story.The story is well-known and I won't go into a blow-by-blow account.  Young diva Christine is mysteriously tutored by someone she believes is her `Angel of Music'.  In reality it is the feared Erik, phantom of the Paris Opera.  Complications arise when Christine is reunited with her childhood sweetheart Raoul.  Erik, too, becomes infatuated with his young pupil.  As passions rise, Christine and Raoul are dragged to the brink of destruction as Erik vows to make Christine his bride...Gerard Butler is a fine Phantom, especially adept at making the role very human and vulnerable, yet also menacing and violent when the situation calls for it.  His singing voice is acceptable (""Music of the Night"", the Phantom's aria, is sailed through with little trouble).  On the whole his performance is quite excellent.Emmy Rossum might very well be the real discovery in this movie.  Little more than a teenager when she made her auspicious debut here as Christine, Miss Rossum is the innocent heart of the story.  A trained New York opera singer since childhood, Emmy Rossum sings Christine's intense and often very difficult arias to perfection.  ""Think of Me"", ""All I Ask of You"" and in particular her heart-wrenching ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" .  On stage the role of Christine is usually shared by two performers who alternate the 8 performance-week between them,  so demanding is the role of Christine.  Rossum could not have picked a more challenging role to make her big debut, but emerges triumphant.Patrick Wilson, a veteran of Broadway musicals, is perfectly-cast as Raoul.  The role has been somewhat re-written here as a more swashbuckling physical adversary to the Phantom.  He also has a fantastic singing voice as you would expect from his stage pedigree.  Minnie Driver is a hilarious delight as Carlotta, the resident diva of the Opera Populaire who is pushed from her perch to make way for up-and-comer Christine.  Driver's singing is of course dubbed (by Margaret Preece, who has played Carlotta onstage).  Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow play the Opera's bewildered and guileless managers Andre and Firmin to perfection.  Miranda Richardson adds untold depths to the role of mysterious ballet mistress Madame Giry.  In the play her connection with the Phantom is merely alluded to, but here the full story of Giry and the Phantom is revealed.  Jennifer Ellison plays Giry's daughter Meg with verve and spirit.Lloyd Webber has added a new number ""Learn to Be Lonely"" which plays over the end credits, sung by Minnie Driver in her own interesting singing voice.

I'd never seen Gerard Butler before, but since seeing him in this wonderful movie, no doubt, I'll never forget him.  The same goes for Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine. She's not only pretty, but is blessed (due to a lot of hard work, as well as a gift) with a beautiful voice. One thing that puzzled me throughout the movie was her tendency to ""whisper"" so often. Even when there were only two people in a room . . . she was whispering. It wasn't obvious that the other characters were doing the same in her presence. I don't know what I would do without 'closed captions'-- I guess I wouldn't be able to hear her. In contrast, when she sings, she sings loudly. I wonder if she does the same thing in other movies she's been in. Is this characteristic of her or was this just a case of poor directing?I'm aware that many people criticize Gerard Butler's signing voice. They obviously haven't paid attention to the fact that the Phantom was NOT supposed to have a ""beautiful"" signing voice; that's the part Emmy was supposed to fill, according to the story. The Phantom wrote the songs and operas, and she was his VOICE. According to that, they both did what they were supposed to do, and were who they were supposed to be.  Personally, I liked his voice; and as I stated, Emmy has a beautiful voice.In addition to the excellent Andrew Lloyd Webber music, the clever use of black and white segments in the movie contrasted with the color portions, I appreciated the superb acting all cast members. Most of all, my attraction to the movie is the intensity of the possessive love the Phantom has for Christine. When he takes her in his arms, it leaves me with an enviable secure feeling. He shows a strength with that embrace, one most females remember experiencing in their lives, or would like to.I see this movie every chance I get and relive the aura of this powerful movie over and over without tiring of it.I think rather than to be criticized at all, the movie and its cast members are to be praised for a job well-done.",5,A visual and audible experience!,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,2059,"['ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'movie', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'seeing', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'same', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'who', 'Christine', 'not', 'only', 'pretty', 'blessed', 'due', 'lot', 'hard', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'gift', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'One', 'thing', 'puzzled', 'movie', 'was', 'tendency', 'whisper', 'so', 'often', 'Even', 'when', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'room', 'was', 'whispering', 'was', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'doing', 'same', 'presence', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'would', 'do', ""'closed"", 'captions', 'guess', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'contrast', 'when', 'loudly', 'wonder', 'same', 'thing', 'other', 'movies', 'been', 'characteristic', 'was', 'just', 'case', 'poor', 'directing', ""'m"", 'aware', 'many', 'people', 'criticize', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'signing', 'voice', 'obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'paid', 'attention', 'fact', 'Phantom', 'was', 'NOT', 'supposed', 'have', 'beautiful', 'signing', 'voice', 'part', 'Emmy', 'was', 'supposed', 'fill', 'according', 'story', 'Phantom', 'wrote', 'songs', 'operas', 'was', 'VOICE', 'According', 'did', 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'do', 'were', 'who', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'Personally', 'liked', 'voice', 'stated', 'Emmy', 'beautiful', 'voice.In', 'addition', 'excellent', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'music', 'clever', 'use', 'black', 'white', 'segments', 'movie', 'contrasted', 'color', 'portions', 'appreciated', 'superb', 'acting', 'cast', 'members', 'Most', 'attraction', 'movie', 'intensity', 'possessive', 'love', 'Phantom', 'Christine', 'When', 'arms', 'enviable', 'secure', 'feeling', 'strength', 'embrace', 'one', 'most', 'females', 'remember', 'experiencing', 'lives', 'would', 'like', 'to.I', 'see', 'movie', 'chance', 'get', 'relive', 'aura', 'powerful', 'movie', 'tiring', 'it.I', 'think', 'rather', 'be', 'criticized', 'movie', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'be', 'praised', 'job', 'well-done']",N/A

And the masqued ball scene is truly spectacular. The music, of course, is amazing. But the biggest surprise and a major delight is the Butler/Rossum chemistry. His vocal phrasing and timing, the delicate purity and strength of her voice; they are well matched in this and truly make the story come alive.

But there are also some fairly obvious flaws.On the positive side, Joel Schumacher was very wise to make both the Phantom and the Count, Raoul, handsome men with very different appeal and to balance these men's attributes so as to create a real tension in the mind of Emma Rossum as well as the viewer. The viewer is put in the position of asking ""which would I chose"" throughout the action.Gerard Butler is excellent as the darkly handsome smoldering long hidden secret lover whereas Patrick Wilson plays the more stereotypical heroic leading man, full of priviledge but capable of heroic action. Patrick Wilson's role here is archtypal, he makes all the moves of the hero. If you want to see Patrick Wilson display his considerable acting skills however, watch him in ""Angels in America"".The music is beautiful and permeates the entire film so that after you leave the theater you can't remember a time in the film that the action was not floating upon and propelled by the musical score.The supporting cast was superb. Minnie Drive as the opera diva, Carlotta, played her role over the top, which was perfect for this entire over-produced production.Now, after identifing three stengthens of the video, I want to point out two weaknesses.First, this operatic product does not really translate well as it moves from stage to film.  Wheras the sets may seem appropriate from the seats of an opera house, on film they seem corney and hoaky. Do we really think that white horses, caves, and boats on a river would all really exist underground under the opera house?Second, Emma Rossum, a beautiful angelic woman who emits vulnerability with every blink of her long eyelashes, has a voice that does not convey operatic strength. Such a weak timid voice could never carry the lead in an opera. For the intimate duets with the Phantom or with Raoul, it works, but on the stage she misses the mark.Thus Phantom of the Opera is a mixed treat for the viewer.",3,A mixed treat,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,2044,"['are', 'certainly', 'very', 'fine', 'aspects', 'film', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'now', 'out', 'DVD', 'are', 'also', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'flaws.On', 'positive', 'side', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'was', 'very', 'wise', 'make', 'Phantom', 'Count', 'Raoul', 'handsome', 'men', 'very', 'different', 'appeal', 'balance', 'men', 'attributes', 'so', 'create', 'real', 'tension', 'mind', 'Emma', 'Rossum', 'as', 'well', 'viewer', 'viewer', 'put', 'position', 'asking', 'would', 'chose', 'action.Gerard', 'Butler', 'excellent', 'darkly', 'handsome', 'smoldering', 'long', 'hidden', 'secret', 'lover', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'more', 'stereotypical', 'heroic', 'leading', 'man', 'full', 'priviledge', 'capable', 'heroic', 'action', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'role', 'here', 'archtypal', 'moves', 'hero', 'want', 'see', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'display', 'considerable', 'acting', 'skills', 'however', 'watch', 'Angels', 'America', '.The', 'music', 'beautiful', 'entire', 'film', 'leave', 'theater', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'time', 'film', 'action', 'was', 'not', 'floating', 'propelled', 'musical', 'score.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'superb', 'Minnie', 'Drive', 'opera', 'diva', 'Carlotta', 'played', 'role', 'top', 'was', 'perfect', 'entire', 'over-produced', 'production.Now', 'identifing', 'three', 'stengthens', 'video', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'two', 'weaknesses.First', 'operatic', 'product', 'not', 'really', 'translate', 'well', 'stage', 'film', 'Wheras', 'sets', 'may', 'seem', 'appropriate', 'seats', 'opera', 'house', 'film', 'seem', 'corney', 'hoaky', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'white', 'horses', 'caves', 'boats', 'river', 'would', 'really', 'exist', 'underground', 'opera', 'house', 'Second', 'Emma', 'Rossum', 'beautiful', 'angelic', 'woman', 'who', 'vulnerability', 'blink', 'long', 'eyelashes', 'voice', 'not', 'convey', 'operatic', 'strength', 'weak', 'timid', 'voice', 'could', 'never', 'carry', 'lead', 'opera', 'intimate', 'duets', 'Phantom', 'Raoul', 'stage', 'mark.Thus', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'mixed', 'treat', 'viewer']",N/A

Gerard Butler's voice is deep & rich & heartbreakingly tragic. You feel his love for Christine & his horrible loneliness. The extra background story helps to understand his actions. The interaction between him & Christine is mesmerizing, especially The Point of No Return. So sensual. If I had the choice it would be the Phantom all the way. The last 20 minutes is so sad!

I dont really like musicals but this I kind of liked. I never heard the original singers or anything so I didnt find anything wrong with the singing other than some of the style is not really my type.Anyway, lets start off with what I do like. The movie is visually stunning. I love the sets and stuff. The beginning I thought was great! It draws you in nice and easy building mystery around the opera house and the Phantom. The music is nice, the story is building. What I really like is when Christine is in her room and the candles blow out and you hear the booming voice of the Phantom in the shadows and finally appears in the mirror and leads Christine down a secret passage down into depths of the opera house. The song here is great, the visuals are stunning, you can feel that the Phantom and Christine have this romantic vibe going on. I loved the movie at this point.UNFORTUNATLY...After this Christine removes the Phantoms mask and he flips out. Christine leaves and then SUDDENLY falls for a childhood friend. Well the love between them doesnt feel very real nor is there any fire going on that you feel when she was with the Phantom earlier. This is where things start to slide I think. The music becomes redundant and none of the songs after the main theme song, ""Phantom of the Opera"" which was sung during the desent to the Phantoms lair, are as good or feel as awesome. Christine and the Phantoms romance is never there again after she takes off the mask. The Phantom feels more like a creepy stalker than a sympathetic person. The movie drags on for too long and the mystery and intreague that was there in the beginning is completely gone. The ending is not tragic at all because you feel nothing for the Phantom like you are supposed to. Had there still felt like a romantic connection was still there between Christine and the Phantom, the ending would have felt alot more tragic and you would feel a little more for the Phantom as he wouldnt seen as just an evil obsessed stalker.Anyway, I recommend the film cause I think you should watch it at least once. I hear the problems that I have with the movie are not there in the stage version as there is more mystery throught the story and you feel more of a connection between the Phantom and Christine. I dont know what the core problem of WHY the movie didnt work out as well as the stage play but I can deffenatly feel something is missing and left me disappointed in the end. I was also hoping for something a little darker but thats just a personal prefrence =P",3,Hmm...

889896,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0007TKNI8,Chris Kennison,"[1, 4]","I wasn't too sure about Phantom of the Opera. God. For years I've loved the music. I own the original CD. I've always wanted to see the broadway play, but never have. It's a goal of mine to someday do so.So when I heard that they were making it into a movie that would be more true to the broadway play... I was elated. Yet, Schumaker??? Dear god... did anybody see Batman & Robin?The movie just squeaks out a 4 in my opinion. There is something missing. Fear. Dread. Maybe? The story elements of the movie don't POP like I would have liked. The Phantom isn't as frightening as I would have liked.The music, on the other hand, is top notch. In fact, from what I understand from the special features, the stage play is only allowed a certain number of orchestra into the pit, but with the film, Andrew Lloyd Weber was gifted with a full orchestra and the music during the DVD is breathtaking. That, to me, is the appeal, and the reason for the 4 stars.If you want a scary Phantom of the Opera, see the 1925 Lon Chaney version, or even the 1989 Robert Englund version, but if you want to hear Andrew Lloyd Weber's fantastic score echo through your living room, you can't go wrong with this one.Besides, Emmy Rossum is fantastic... and her voice is spine-tingling when she sings ""Think of Me"".",4,MUSIC enough to chill the spine,1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,1290,"['was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'God', 'years', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'music', 'own', 'original', 'CD', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'broadway', 'play', 'never', 'have', 'goal', 'mine', 'someday', 'do', 'so.So', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'making', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'true', 'broadway', 'play', 'was', 'elated', 'Schumaker', 'Dear', 'god', 'did', 'anybody', 'see', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'movie', 'just', 'squeaks', 'out', '4', 'opinion', 'something', 'missing', 'Fear', 'Dread', 'Maybe', 'story', 'elements', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'POP', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Phantom', ""n't"", 'as', 'frightening', 'would', 'have', 'liked.The', 'music', 'other', 'hand', 'top', 'notch', 'fact', 'what', 'understand', 'special', 'features', 'stage', 'play', 'only', 'allowed', 'certain', 'number', 'orchestra', 'pit', 'film', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Weber', 'was', 'gifted', 'full', 'orchestra', 'music', 'DVD', 'breathtaking', 'appeal', 'reason', '4', 'stars.If', 'want', 'scary', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'see', '1925', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'version', 'even', '1989', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'version', 'want', 'hear', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Weber', 'fantastic', 'score', 'echo', 'living', 'room', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'one.Besides', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'fantastic', 'voice', 'spine-tingling', 'when', 'Think', 'Me']",N/A
889897,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0007TKNI8,Chris Pandolfi,"[12, 12]","Occasionally, a film is so bad that it rightfully deserves to be panned by audiences and critics alike. At other times, an incredibly well made film is poorly received, a fact that is both shocking and dismaying. Joel Schumacher's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" falls into the second category. This movie is, in a word, incredible. It's a pure sight and sound musical fantasy, grandiose in scope and delightfully over the top in drama and romance. Rarely have I found myself completely absorbed in a film; it left me unable to concentrate on anything afterwards other than it's highly memorable and effective score, composed with great gusto by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It's just the kind of music that has the ability to stay in your head long after leaving the theater (stage or screen). That's something I definitely look for in a musical.Based on the blockbuster London and Broadway stage musical (which itself was based on the novel ""Le Fantm de l'Opera"" by Gaston Leroux), the story of ""Phantom"" can basically be described as a gothic love triangle. Christine (Emmy Rossum), a beautiful and nave young girl is torn between her childhood sweetheart and a mysterious figure who honed her ability to sing. There are definite upsides to both men: Raoul (Patrick Wilson) is charming and handsome, and he can look back on his childhood days with Christine with happiness; the Phantom (Gerard Butler), despite the fact that he's disfigured and sliding into madness, is seductive and overpowering, and he has the ability to ignite Christine's lust. By the end of the film, she realizes that choosing either one will require making a great sacrifice.A series of subplots work their way into the film, the most prominent being the rivalry between Christine and Carlotta (Minnie Driver), a boisterous, temperamental Italian diva with a comically over-exaggerated singing voice. Christine clearly has nothing against her; I can't even recall a moment when they speak to each other. Carlotta, on the other hand, hates Christine with a passion, and absolutely refuses to let a younger, prettier, more talented girl upstage her. She never understands just how ridiculous her feelings for Christine are, even after the Phantom humiliates Carlotta by lacing her throat spray with a voice disabling substance. And he proves to be just as stubborn with his feelings: he won't let anyone upstage Christine, and if he has to kill a few people to prove his point, then so be it.Along the way, we also meet: Andre and Firmin (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Simon Callow), the Opera Populaire's newest managers who only care about their financial success; Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson), the Ballet Mistress who knows more about the Phantom than she initially let's on; and Meg Giry (Jennifer Ellison), Madame Giry's daughter and Christine's best friend. They weave in and out of the story fairly evenly, and in some way, they all play a part in the main plot (some play bigger parts than others). Out of all these characters, the only one I took issue with was Madame Giry. Why is she the only one with a French accent when every character in this film lives in France? I realize this is just nitpicking, and it's really not a big enough problem to ruin the story (but it is still noticeable).As paper-thin and clich&eacute; as the plot may sound, it's such classic material that it lends itself perfectly to an operatic musical. The romance is also effectively enhanced by the lyrics, written with care and precision by Charles Hart (with additional lyrics written by Richard Stilgoe). Never once did they seem contrived or ill fitting (and this is after they were altered from their original stage incarnations). It just goes to show that a memorable song is about more than just a catchy tune; it needs to work with its words, as well.One of the criticisms that overshadowed this film was Gerard Butler's performance (acting and singing). Granted, the Phantom is supposed to represent a twisted father figure for Christine, and that does necessitate an older, more established actor. However, this film adaptation was clearly attempting to reinvent his character, and for that reason, a younger, fresher actor suited the film perfectly. As far as his singing voice is concerned, I've actually read reviews that likened it to a low-grade high school production. Are they kidding me? He may not have the greatest voice in the world, but it's nowhere near as bad as some have made it out to be. In my opinion, he effectively manages to carry through the songs. In other words: I never once disliked the decision made to cast him in this film.One of the pivotal (and best) scenes is of the Phantom leading Christine through the underground catacombs and into his lair during the title song. It was meant to be a surreal, dreamlike descent; some of the imagery, including living arms that act as sconces, wouldn't make sense under lucid circumstances. But Christine is in a trance, susceptible to an active imagination. The audience feels this, as well, by means of some very unconventional methods. But since it's a moment of pure fantasy, it's perfectly acceptable for huge candelabra to magically rise from the waters and for the music to include electric guitar solos and synthesized drumbeats. While this may initially come off as historically inaccurate, it still manages to fit with the tone of the story. Besides, Webber himself says that the music was designed to have a slight rock 'n' roll feel to it, if not for the story, then for the sake of connecting it with a modern audience.Few musicals have had me as entranced as ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has. From the songs to the performances to the bold set and costume designs, it can take you away to a different world. That's probably one of the corniest ways to describe a film, but in this case, it's really the only one that fits. And it's true what some have said: if you loved the play, then you'll love the movie. So what if it was unsuccessful at the box office? Who cares if the critics completely missed the point? We now have it on DVD, and in the privacy of our homes, no one can tell us what makes a movie good or bad.",5,Andrew Lloyd Webber's Musical of All Musicals,1140998400,"02 27,

Sure the set decorations and cousums are great, and Emmy Rossum is a surprise charmer as Christine, but the film comes apart with the male leads of The Phantom and Raoul, with musical numbers that are too long, and with a story that really was never that great.What I do know about The Phantom of the Opera is the classic silent 1925 version, with such an actual scary Phantom, and that has much more of an effect on me as a long time movie fan than this kind of cheesy insanity that the Phantom of this film. Here Gerald Butler as the Phantom is miniacle, jealous, and lusts after Christine, and will do anything to keep the opera house running as he thinks it should. He's more an annoyance than anything scary and conveniently he can pop out of anywhere at at time the story wants him, and hold people in their tracks as they try to put together what they were doing the last time they saw him. Patrick Wilson is a paticular weak point as Raoul, the human who loves Christine in the film's love triangle. He's really kind of a bore, and we have two really mediocre men fighting over this great girl, and the love chemistry is really limited at both fronts as she falls back and fourth from one to the other.I understand many people like this film much more than I do. The idea that a stranger with a mask could wisk a great girl from and opera house, to his dungon that no one knows about, without her putting up the least resistance, is to me flawed from the begining. It's not really that interesting or compelling of a love story, and in my opinion the musical numbers are pretty forgetable, while the dialog in the tone of song is unnecessary for a movie musical. I really wish that, like the recent great broadway to movie musical Chicago, this film could have made itself a standout among it own, instead of something pretty, at times decent, but at others sluggish. The ending of this film, on the plus side, is quite well done, and makes up somewhat for some of the earlier flaws.",3,A mixed blessing.,1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,2134,"[""'m"", 'probably', 'less', 'familiar', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'most', 'people', 'here', 'have', 'contend', 'version', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'Sure', 'set', 'decorations', 'cousums', 'are', 'great', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'surprise', 'charmer', 'Christine', 'film', 'apart', 'male', 'leads', 'Phantom', 'Raoul', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'too', 'long', 'story', 'really', 'was', 'never', 'great.What', 'do', 'know', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'classic', 'silent', '1925', 'version', 'actual', 'scary', 'Phantom', 'much', 'more', 'effect', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'fan', 'kind', 'cheesy', 'insanity', 'Phantom', 'film', 'Here', 'Gerald', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'miniacle', 'jealous', 'lusts', 'Christine', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'keep', 'opera', 'house', 'running', 'should', 'more', 'annoyance', 'anything', 'scary', 'conveniently', 'can', 'pop', 'anywhere', 'time', 'story', 'hold', 'people', 'tracks', 'try', 'put', 'together', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'paticular', 'weak', 'point', 'Raoul', 'human', 'who', 'Christine', 'film', 'love', 'triangle', 'really', 'kind', 'bore', 'have', 'two', 'really', 'mediocre', 'men', 'fighting', 'great', 'girl', 'love', 'chemistry', 'really', 'limited', 'fronts', 'back', 'fourth', 'one', 'other.I', 'understand', 'many', 'people', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'idea', 'stranger', 'mask', 'could', 'wisk', 'great', 'girl', 'opera', 'house', 'dungon', 'one', 'putting', 'up', 'least', 'resistance', 'flawed', 'begining', 'not', 'really', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'love', 'story', 'opinion', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'pretty', 'forgetable', 'dialog', 'tone', 'song', 'unnecessary', 'movie', 'musical', 'really', 'wish', 'recent', 'great', 'broadway', 'movie', 'musical', 'Chicago', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'standout', 'own', 'instead', 'something', 'pretty', 'times', 'decent', 'others', 'sluggish', 'ending', 'film', 'plus', 'side', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'up', 'somewhat', 'earlier', 'flaws']",N/A

I've read the book, seen the stage production, and memorized the libretto.  When I heard this movie was being made, I was excited, and kept up with all the production news.As it happens, I was terribly disappointed with this movie.  For a lot of reasons.  First of all, the performers left a lot to be desired.  Gerry Butler can not sing.  He can make noises that sound similar to pitched grunting and growling, but the man simply cannot sing.  Each song he performed was painful to listen to.  Honestly, I have listened to the ""Music of the Night"" scene once, and only once.  MotN is my favorite song and he completely killed it, so anytime I watch the movie I skip past that scene.  Surely there must be SOMEONE who could have given a better performance.  As for Emmy Rossum, she is good for being sixteen years old, but she simply does not have the skills or experience for the part of Christine.  Her voice is pleasant, but she has real difficulty hitting high notes and constantly scoops up to them.  That would be fine if this was a jazz production, but she is supposed to be singing opera.  But what really did her in was her horrible acting.  The graveyard scene in particular was horrific.  You're standing on your father's grave -- you want to shed a tear or two perhaps?  As for the rest of the cast, I would have to say they are mediocre at best.  I can understand that some roles do not allow for a life-altering performance, but none of them really made much of an impression on me.  Except for Patrick Wilson (Raoul).  He has a beautiful voice and sings with expression as well as excellent vocal technique.  He is, perhaps, the only member of the cast that makes the musical performance bearable.In addition, there were so many alterations to the show that changed it for the worse.  Andre and Firmin are apparently a couple of pedophiles, which is made clear when they walk into the opera house staring at the young ballerinas like pieces of meat.  Lines that are meant to be sung are spoken.  (Who wants to listen to people rhyme when they speak?)  The entire ""Don Juan"" rehearsal scene was left out.  The scenes in the second act were jumbled around.  Piangi has what appears to be a midget side kick that mirrors his every move.  ""New"" scenes were added but do nothing for the plot.  And for me, the final nail in the coffin was the graveyard scene.  Not only was Rossum's performance of ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" pathetic, but ""Wandering Child"" was made into a poorly sung duet instead of the climactic trio it was meant to be.I won't even get into the ""disfiguration"" of the phantom.  Honestly, Tom Cruise's character in ""Vanilla Sky"" looked more frightening than Schumacher's phantom.However, there are some good things about this movie.  The music mostly stays true to the original score, which is nice.  Some lyrics are changed, but what can you do?  The cinematography and special effects are quite entertaining, mostly.  And again, Patrick Wilson's performance was beautiful.All in all, it's better than nothing, right?",3,Review from a real phanatic...,1218844800,"08 16, 2008",2008,3119,"['Let', 'kick', 'off', 'review', 'saying', 'am', 'die-hard', 'phan', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'stage', 'production', 'memorized', 'libretto', 'When', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'was', 'excited', 'kept', 'up', 'production', 'was', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'lot', 'reasons', 'First', 'all', 'performers', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'Gerry', 'Butler', 'can', 'not', 'sing', 'can', 'make', 'noises', 'sound', 'similar', 'pitched', 'grunting', 'growling', 'man', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'sing', 'song', 'performed', 'was', 'painful', 'listen', 'Honestly', 'have', 'listened', 'Music', 'Night', 'scene', 'once', 'only', 'once', 'MotN', 'favorite', 'song', 'completely', 'killed', 'anytime', 'watch', 'movie', 'skip', 'scene', 'Surely', 'must', 'be', 'SOMEONE', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'better', 'performance', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'good', 'being', 'sixteen', 'years', 'old', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'skills', 'experience', 'part', 'Christine', 'voice', 'pleasant', 'real', 'difficulty', 'hitting', 'high', 'notes', 'constantly', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'was', 'jazz', 'production', 'supposed', 'be', 'singing', 'opera', 'what', 'really', 'did', 'was', 'horrible', 'acting', 'graveyard', 'scene', 'particular', 'was', 'horrific', ""'re"", 'standing', 'father', 'grave', 'want', 'shed', 'tear', 'two', 'perhaps', 'rest', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'are', 'mediocre', 'best', 'can', 'understand', 'roles', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'life-altering', 'performance', 'none', 'really', 'made', 'much', 'impression', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Raoul', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'sings', 'expression', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'vocal', 'technique', 'perhaps', 'only', 'member', 'cast', 'musical', 'performance', 'bearable.In', 'addition', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'alterations', 'show', 'changed', 'worse', 'Andre', 'Firmin', 'are', 'apparently', 'couple', 'pedophiles', 'made', 'clear', 'when', 'walk', 'opera', 'house', 'staring', 'young', 'ballerinas', 'pieces', 'meat', 'Lines', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'sung', 'are', 'spoken', 'Who', 'listen', 'people', 'rhyme', 'when', 'speak', 'entire', 'Don', 'Juan', 'rehearsal', 'scene', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'scenes', 'second', 'act', 'were', 'jumbled', 'around', 'Piangi', 'what', 'be', 'midget', 'side', 'kick', 'mirrors', 'move', 'New', 'scenes', 'were', 'added', 'do', 'nothing', 'plot', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'was', 'graveyard', 'scene', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Rossum', 'performance', 'Wishing', 'Were', 'Somehow', 'Here', 'Again', 'pathetic', 'Wandering', 'Child', 'was', 'made', 'poorly', 'sung', 'duet', 'instead', 'climactic', 'trio', 'was', 'meant', 'be.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'disfiguration', 'phantom', 'Honestly', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'looked', 'more', 'frightening', 'Schumacher', 'phantom.However', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'music', 'mostly', 'true', 'original', 'score', 'nice', 'lyrics', 'are', 'changed', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'mostly', 'again', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'performance', 'was', 'beautiful.All', 'better', 'nothing', 'right']",N/A

I am amazed, and for once I left the theater feeling as if I really got my money's worth so please, I implore you, save yourself the trouble and disregard any and all negative reviews because they either don't know a good movie from a bad one or they just can't get over the fact that this isn't the original cast! I may have never had the pleasure of seeing this as a play before, therefore I cannot compare the two, but I am at least familiar with many of the pieces sung here and I, too, had high expectations. I was preparing myself for a major letdown but instead was awed beyond my wildest dreams. And I honestly don't care whether this stayed true to every aspect of the original novel by Gaston Leroux or not (although I think it did). This is incredible either way so lets not scrutinize and view this, instead, as an individual whole.Many have quibbled about Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler not living up to the great standards Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford left us with, and as true as that may be (singing wise) I believe they chose a remarkably talented group of actors who have the voices, emotional impact, and looks to match. There's a glowing innocence yet overbearing sensuality about Christine and Gerard embodied the dark, mysterious Phantom hauntingly, whom I found to be quite handsome with the mask on, which covers less than half his face. I even got a kick out of the bossy, demanding Opera singer Carlotta, played like a true diva by the wonderful Minnie Driver (and no, that's not her actually singing, but I am basing her solely on performance).With the thankful help and guidance of Andrew Lloyd Webber, producer Joel Schumacher really captured the essence of this classic horror-romance, bringing it to life for the first time ever from the stage to the big screen. It's a huge understatement to say the entire cast and crew did a splendid job and I will be very shocked, not to mention outraged, if this does not at least get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The lavishly decadent costumes and breathtaking sets and cinematography are visually stunning... The ambiance chilling yet beautiful... I especially love the part when the Phantom is taking Christine to his underground lair in a gondola as candles rise up from out of the water. I also enjoyed the sword fight from within the snow covered cemetery between the Phantom and Raul - the one who has won the pureness of Christine's heart (twisting every way).Despite the Phantom being a villain who kills without a thought, he's a likable villain and you'll probably find yourself feeling sorry for him, as did I, once you learn of his past - the reason behind his torment turned madness, as explained by Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) who plays Christine's 'mother'.You know something is spectacular when everyone claps afterwards and this is hands-down the best movie I've seen in a long, long time so go see it NOW!

Some don't like it because it's not an identical twin to the Broadway show. Well, here's a suggestion: get on a bus, get a room in NYC, go to the ticket booth in Time's Square. Get a ticket to the Phantom. Have a hot dog, enjoy the sites, then enjoy a wonderful evening of the Broadway Version of The Phantom of the Opera- then go home. Relax. Feed the dog, get the paper and mail. Get back into your normal routine. Now, realize that the two will never be alike and it's not the end of the world!Then you have those who nit pick that Gerard Butler doesn't sing perfectly- again, follow the instructions above.I've seen both. YES, the live Broadway version is spectacular but so is THIS. This is sheer genius. That's what really kicks me in the stomach. Does anyone who gives this a bad review understand how much work, thought, creativity and originality went into this? Do they realize how incredible it is that it stayed THIS close to the Broadway production? Have they ever tried to make a movie or anything creative? Really, try making something like this before throwing your tomatoes.One last rant, Amazon begins by comparing THIS to the musical Chicago? HA! Have you seen the live version? &#34;Gee, let's be cool and just wear black. We don't need... SETS!&#34; Talk about presumptuous and arrogant.(Warning: Plot spoilers)OK, now, onto what we should be discussing. The summaries are many so I won't rehash. I think there are deeper things to consider in the story. For example, should Christine have chosen Raul and why? It's obvious why she shouldn't choose the Phantom, but had he not hung the stage hand, would or could it have been different? Did she always believe he was the spirit of her father or an angel? What was in her mind when the Phantom showed her the wedding dress?On my end of things, I empathize with the Phantom because he's a self-made man, unlike Raul. His vision of what life could, or should be is at least intriguing. And what of Christine? Was she a simpleton, running off with the prince instead of danger, or was she an expression of what women  want: security, safety, with a touch of opulence? What was her life with Raul like? Yes, he was a childhood sweetheart, but what was he like as an adult?  He seems jovial, but boring. Also, was Christine always in a state of indecision about the two? It seems to me she was until she (coldly) removes his mask in Don Juan. That always seemed to be her power- perhaps she enjoyed exerting it. Perhaps she was trying to decide whether to be a bad girl or good girl.

You have your plot, your characters and their motivations but rather than talk it out through dialogue they start bursting into song. At least in Grease it looked odd but it still had catchy tunes. This just seems like singing singing and more singing, dialogue and again with the singing.Christine Daae is an actress working at the Opera Populaire(instead of the Paris Opera House). She's a considerable talent if it only weren't for the high-pitched prima donna Carlotta. An accident during rehearsals as Christine start singing and blowing everyone away.Her teacher just happens to be the famed Opera Ghost, or the title character Phantom of the Opera, who has specific requests about the show and consequences will come if broken. The opera house undergoes new management so they don't believe in it and put Carlotta in the lead role, disobeying the Phantom's request of it being Christine. Plus, it seems she has fallen for Raoul, another young man so the Phantom feels rejected so he kind of loses it.One thing about the film is that it does look great.

I realize I am the 1600'th person to review this on Amazon, so no one may ever see this, but I couldn't let all these 5 star reviews pass.I love Phantom on stage.  I really do.  I have no problem with the most of the casting of this movie as well.  I'm sure all the actors can sing and they seem to fit their roles.  But let me sum up the issues.  As a movie musical this movie SUCKS because:* Joel Schumacher is an idiot* it plays like the play was rewritten as a romance novel (a bad one), then that romance novel was rewritten into a screenplay then they filmed it.*Gerard Butler should be much much uglier in his phantom makeup.  MUCH uglier*this the biggest one - the lip synching is just awful.  Nobody expects the singing on the soundtrack to be the singing that was actually sung by the actors on set - BUT - they should actually full on sing their parts when on set.  Rossum at times look like she is barely breathing but and her lips are a split second off and yet the soundtrack would have us believe she is belting an aria off the charts.*sets are shot to close and not used to good effect to give us the grandeur of the setting - it undercuts the themes and musicI was basically angry for 2 straight hours watching this",1,butchery,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,1272,"['Here', 'deal', 'summarize', 'this..', 'realize', 'am', ""1600'th"", 'person', 'review', 'Amazon', 'one', 'may', 'ever', 'see', 'could', ""n't"", 'let', 'all', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'pass.I', 'love', 'Phantom', 'stage', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'problem', 'most', 'casting', 'movie', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'sure', 'actors', 'can', 'sing', 'seem', 'fit', 'roles', 'let', 'sum', 'up', 'issues', 'movie', 'musical', 'movie', 'SUCKS', '*', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'idiot*', 'play', 'was', 'rewritten', 'romance', 'novel', 'bad', 'one', 'then', 'romance', 'novel', 'was', 'rewritten', 'screenplay', 'then', 'filmed', '*Gerard', 'Butler', 'should', 'be', 'much', 'much', 'uglier', 'phantom', 'makeup', 'MUCH', 'biggest', 'one', 'lip', 'synching', 'just', 'awful', 'Nobody', 'singing', 'soundtrack', 'be', 'singing', 'was', 'actually', 'sung', 'actors', 'set', 'BUT', 'should', 'actually', 'full', 'sing', 'parts', 'when', 'set', 'Rossum', 'times', 'look', 'barely', 'breathing', 'lips', 'are', 'split', 'second', 'off', 'yet', 'soundtrack', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'belting', 'aria', 'charts', '*sets', 'are', 'shot', 'close', 'not', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'give', 'grandeur', 'setting', 'themes', 'musicI', 'was', 'basically', 'angry', '2', 'straight', 'hours', 'watching']",N/A
889907,A1T17LMQABMBN5,B0007TKNI8,CoffeeGurl,"[8, 10]","I have read the novel (it is, in fact, one of my all-time favorites) and seen the Broadway musical starring Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman on video.  I was reluctant to watch this film.  After all, I am usually disappointed with Hollywood remakes and I end up making comparisons with the original works. (I recently did that with the new Pride and Prejudice.)  The stars of this film had a lot to do with my hesitation.  I adore Michael Crawford as the Phantom and couldn't imagine someone else playing the part.  I often feel this way about remakes.  If Hollywood ever decides to remake Gone with the Wind (I hope not!), I doubt I'd be able to accept a new actor in the role of Rhett Butler, even if the new actor does a splendid job in his own right.  I felt that way before watching this film.  I thought that gorgeous Gerard Butler had been miscast for the role of the Phantom.  Now that I've seen this film, however, I have to take back whatever prejudices I had before giving it a whirl.  Anyone who has read the book and seen the musical know that The Phantom of the Opera is set in an opera house in 19th century Paris.  The opera house is being occupied by a mysterious masked man who gives singing lessons to young Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) and develops an obsessive love for the young soprano.  He'd do anything to make her the star of the opera, including commit murder.  How would he react when he realizes that the object of his affections has feelings for Raoul (Patrick Wilson)?The Phantom of the Opera is beautiful, haunting and tragically romantic.  The love triangle between Christine, Raoul and the Phantom (whose name is Erik, but no one calls him that in this film version) is one of my all-time favorites.  This story has a special place in my heart because it was the one that brought my passion for anti-heroes and wounded souls to life.  In this film, like in the play and the book, I found myself rooting for the Phantom rather than for Raoul.  Gerard Butler does a splendid job in bringing out the Phantom's many complexities and nuances -- giving this compelling character depth.  Butler's Phantom is more vulnerable and less ironic than Crawford's portrayal of the character.  I like them both because they manage to move me, but for different reasons.  The actors' ages and physical appearance are also different.  As said in the previous paragraph, Butler is gorgeous, and he took my breath away when he looked back at Christine during the scene where he takes her to his lair and sings the main title (one of my favorite scenes).  His beautiful eyes are very expressive and they work wonders for me.  I couldn't understand why Christine was so repulsed by his deformity when the rest of him looked so delectable.  That bit of this film version was not realistic.  If I were Christine and seen Butler's Phantom, I would have felt everything but repulsion.  Awe?  Yes.  Fascination?  Absolutely.  Freight?  No way.  This Phantom is too sexy for words.  As for the rest of the main cast, Patrick Wilson is also wonderful in his portrayal of Raoul.  He is the proverbial hero who would do anything for the heroine.  He is also quite boring, but most characters of this type are when put together with a compelling ""villain"" like the Phantom.  Wilson's Raoul was nevertheless wonderful and tender and he moved me when he sang ""All I Ask of You.""  Emmy Rossum is quite good as Christine.  She doesn't outdo Sarah Brightman though.  But she does a good job and has a beautiful voice.  Minnie Driver is campy and fun as the diva Carlotta.  I loved her over-the-top prima donna antics.  As for the rest of the film, I agree with those who say the film is campy and over-the-top at times, but you kind of expect that in a musical of this sort (Moulin Rouge anyone?).  Hiring the director of the Batman series was quite appropriate.  The Andrew Lloyd Webber score is of course beautiful!  The music is so haunting and romantic that I cried while listening to it at times.  ""Think of Me,"" ""Angel of Music,"" ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" ""Masquerade,"" ""All I Ask of You,"" ""The Point of No Return,"" and ""The Music of the Night"" are my favorites and I adored them in this version.  ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has a modern, Rocky Horror Picture Show-type of sound that is irresistible.  I love the organ sounds throughout the soundtrack.  Everything is splendid. Even Gerard Butler, who I heard hadn't had proper vocal training before doing this film, sounded wonderful here.  His voice is what I'd imagined the Phantom's to be -- husky, dark and masculine.  (I always thought Crawford's singing was a little too high-pitched for my taste.)  But more important than vocal skill, he conveys so much emotion with his acting and singing.  It was breathtaking.  I am definitely getting the soundtrack CD!  The wardrobe and sets are exquisite and lavish, the music is gorgeous, the actors are memorable, and the story and scenes (especially the ones where they show the Phantom's awful childhood and when he and Christine perform ""Point of No Return"" near the end, where Butler reduced me to tears until the credits rolled) are dark, mesmerizing and poignant.  Do yourself a favor and watch this film!  Don't let preconceived notions get in the way of enjoying this incredible production.  The DVD transfer of view and sound is top-notch.  I have added it to my film library and will watch it again and again.",5,I would give it 10 stars if I could!,1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,5428,"['have', 'read', 'novel', 'fact', 'one', 'all-time',

889908,A3DTUMLBZCG47D,B0007TKNI8,Connor J. Hamilton,"[3, 8]","The Phantom of the Opera is an exceedingly good musical; I have had the misfortune of never having seen it live, but hearing it on CD is more than enough. In fact, it is arguably better than the novel on which it was based. It all depends on what sort of tone you are looking for, and whether you prefer Gaston Leroux's explanations for the Phantom's capabilites, or the more supernatural and inexplicable nature of the musical.Anyway, this movie version is a worthy production of the fantastically popular Broadway show. The set is marvellously rich and colorful. The decision to have the opening auction scene in grainy black and white is a good one; it provides an especially stark contrast when the Paris Opera House is restored to its former beauty to the thunderous strains of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music.Emmy Rossum is fantastic as Christine Daae, and seems to step into Sarah Brightman's shoes with little difficulty. Her voice is charming--though some of the more difficult parts seem harder for her to surmount that Ms. Brightman; but that may change in time.Gerard Butler is a little less satisfying as the Phantom. He acts the part well enough, but his voice is the worst in the film, and for the main character that is not too good. It isn't a *bad* voice, but compared to the rest of the cast is leaves a little to be desired. One must suspend belief when we are told that he is giving Christine VOICE LESSONS. One just hast to shake his head at that.But Mr. Butler does not have enough in him to ruin the film; all-in-all it is quite a good production. I found it better on the second time around than at the theatre, though that usually happens to me with most movies.So, if you like the musical, see this film. I found it very nice to actually see what the sets and whatnot were supposed to look like. I know a friend who has seen the live production, and she said that the sets were very similar, though of course larger and more flexible, since one can do far more with a film than a stage production.~Connor",5,Worth Your Time...Beautifully Done,1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,2027,"['Phantom', 'Opera', 'exceedingly', 'good', 'musical', 'have', 'had', 'misfortune', 'never', 'having', 'seen', 'live', 'hearing', 'CD', 'more', 'enough', 'fact', 'arguably', 'better', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'what', 'sort', 'tone', 'are', 'looking', 'prefer', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', 'explanations', 'Phantom', 'capabilites', 'more', 'supernatural', 'inexplicable', 'nature', 'musical.Anyway', 'movie', 'version', 'worthy', 'production', 'fantastically', 'popular', 'Broadway', 'show', 'set', 'marvellously', 'rich', 'colorful', 'decision', 'have', 'opening', 'auction', 'scene', 'grainy', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'one', 'especially', 'stark', 'contrast', 'when', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'House', 'restored', 'former', 'beauty', 'thunderous', 'strains', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'music.Emmy', 'Rossum', 'fantastic', 'Christine', 'Daae', 'step', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'shoes', 'little', 'difficulty', 'voice', 'charming', 'more', 'difficult', 'parts', 'seem', 'harder', 'surmount', 'Ms.', 'Brightman', 'may', 'change', 'time.Gerard', 'Butler', 'little', 'less', 'satisfying', 'Phantom', 'part', 'well', 'enough', 'voice', 'worst', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'too', 'good', ""n't"", '*bad*', 'voice', 'compared', 'rest', 'cast', 'little', 'be', 'desired', 'One', 'must', 'suspend', 'belief', 'when', 'are', 'told', 'giving', 'Christine', 'VOICE', 'LESSONS', 'One', 'just', 'hast', 'shake', 'head', 'that.But', 'Mr.', 'Butler', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'ruin', 'film', 'all-in-all', 'quite', 'good', 'production', 'found', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'theatre', 'usually', 'most', 'movies.So', 'like', 'musical', 'see', 'film', 'found', 'very', 'nice', 'actually', 'see', 'what', 'sets', 'whatnot', 'were', 'supposed', 'look', 'know', 'friend', 'who', 'seen', 'live', 'production', 'said', 'sets', 'were', 'very', 'similar', 'course', 'larger', 'more', 'flexible', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'far', 'more', 'film', 'stage', 'production.~Connor']",N/A

To them a perfect adaption might mean it's exactly the same as the stage musical, which this certainly is not.  But when I say a perfect adaption I mean they took the stage show and re-molded it into what works best for film.  The changes some people criticize make sense when you think of the differences in telling a story on the stage or in a film.The cast is well put together.  People complain about the lack of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, but I disagree.  Gerard Butler does not have Crawford's voice, but I think he brings more raw emotion to the role.  Under the scrutiny of the camera, this to me is a more believable Phantom.  And forgive me for saying this but I would never have wanted to see Sarah Brightman in this film.

889912,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,B0007TKNI8,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[0, 0]","Personally, I've never been a big fan of movie musicals, though there have been a few exceptions. One of those exceptions is Joel Schumacher's marvelous film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Weber's The Phantom of the Opera. The lavish production perfectly captures the excitement of the stage, while cleverly exploiting the cinematic medium for maximum impact. The film showcases impressive costumes, awesome sets, and an unexpectedly terrific cast, which reenergizes the music with a youthful vitality that is sometimes absent in stage productions. Of the cast, the real showstopper is young Emmy Rossum, whose porcelain skin, gorgeous brown eyes, and breathtaking vocals lend an urgency and sympathy to the character of the Phantom, who is played by Gerard Butler. The rest of the excellent cast includes Patrick Wilson as Raoul, Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, Jennifer Ellison as Meg Giry, and Minnie Driver as Carlotta. All are superb in their respective roles. Many of the songs have been updated slightly to suit the vocal capabilities of the actors, as well as to achieve greater emotional investment with the characters. Every member of the cast does their own singing (or so says the press release), which is astonishing when you consider that most of the actors have never sung professionally before.Orphaned at age seven, when her famous violinist  father passed away, Christine Daae was raised by Madame Giry in the Paris Opera Populaire. From a young age she showed great promise as both a singer and a dancer. The secret to her talents can be partly attributed to a mysterious voice that she's heard since the death of her father. This voice guides her and tutors her with her singing, but little does she suspect that it is the voice of Erik, the Phantom of the Opera. The Phantom lives deep beneath the opera house  where he uses his ingenious talents to orchestrates all to ensure Christine's success. But when Christine's childhood friend, the now handsome and dashing Raoul returns and expresses his love for Christine, the Phantom grows jealous and his wrath echoes throughout the Opera Populaire. The Phantom, filled with anger and consumed by possessive passion, kidnaps Christine and takes her to his cavernous underground lair. After unmasking him and revealing a disfigured face, the Phantom lets Christine go. Then he sends a threatening note declaring that Christine should replace Carlotta, an obnoxious prim Donna and the star of the latest opera, but when the new owners of the opera disregard the Phantom's note, he disrupts the performance on opening night. The Phantom kills a stage hand, and sabotages Carlotta's performance, practically destroying her career. Meanwhile Raoul plans to take Christine away from the opera house before misfortune should befall her too, but the Phantom won't allow it. The Phantom sets into action a plan that will guarantee that he and Christine won't be separated... ever. Yet Christine, torn between Raoul and the Phantom, is left to make the decision of a lifetime.The screenplay, which was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher, is based upon the musical written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Charles Hart, and Richard Stilgoe. The musical was inspired by the serial novel written by Gaston Leroux, though much has been changed in order to create a more romantic atmosphere.Stylistically, The Phantom of the Opera has no equal as the production design is immaculate and unlike anything seen in film before. And as I've mentioned before the lavish costumes, which were designed by Alexandra Byrne, help to set the tone of the film. The lighting and cinematography are also spectacular. In fact, it's hard to find any significant flaws in the film, at least not from a technical standpoint.My only complaint is that some of the actors have difficulty adapting the acting style of the stage to that of the screen. However, this is a very minor annoyance and the majority of the cast is superb, especially Emmy Rossum as Christine and Gerard Butler as The Phantom. Both should be deeply proud of their impressive work in this film.Without a doubt, The Phantom of the Opera is a classic.Also recommended:The Phantom Of The Operaby Gaston LerouxThe Phantom of the

I only have one thing to comment on:  why can't we have on ""Phantom of the Opera"" film that is passionately acted, and acted only.  I understand that the songs are what make it what it is, but I'm a hopeless romantic and would love to see an epic film made out of this outstanding story.  No complaints here though.

889917,A3HN4OZBYVDTU6,B0007TKNI8,"Crypt ""thecrypt777""","[6, 6]","I've been a fan of the Musical since I was a child. I still remember how excited I was when I heard that they were planning a film version. Well, after growing up and pretty much forgetting about the musical for a few years, a film version has FINALY come. What can I say? I'm a 24 year old guy and I was weeping like an old lady in that theater. I don't know why, but I've always identified with the Phantom, particularly Webber's interpretation of the character, although I've been a fan of the original novel since I was 8.When I first heard rumors that Joel Schumacher was directing, I rolled my eyes and said ""Hollywood has done it again!"" Although The Lost Boys is one of my favorite movies, I still haven't forgiven him for destroying the Batman series. But after seeing this film, I may consider overlooking his folly! It was absolutely beautiful. What strikes me as weird is the way that critics seem to be blasting the movie left and right! I had read many of the reviews before seeing the movie. My heart sank. Many critics ripped the movie apart, giving many examples of what was wrong with it. Some gave it a very average rating. I went into the theater with this in mind and decided to look for many of the alleged flaws. I soon realized that yeah, maybe you could find these flaws here if you really dug for them, but it's still a stretch. I'm convinced that the critics went to see the film already convinced that they were going to hate it. I have to say this isn't the first time I've loved a movie that the critics hated. I think sometimes you need to just forget about what critics say and experience something for yourself. There are far too many out there who think that their opinions should be considered gospel. This movie touched me and moved me profoundly. But people have always been divided regarding Webber's Phantom. I have my conspiracy theories about that, but I won't get into that here. I found the acting to be good to great. Yes Raoul was a bit stiff, but that was his character. You would be too if you were a 19th century count. The Phantom was splendid to say the least. Who cares if it isn't the aging Michael Crawford? Gerard Butler is impressive. He's got plenty of menace and passion in his voice. At times it is obvious that he's not a professional singer, but for an actor who ""learned"" to sing just for his role, he's really quite good. Acting-wise, his portrayal of the Phantom is mesmerizing at times. I loved the way he seemed to have a completely different personality when unmasked. Masked he's a powerful, elegant, and mysterious character, unmasked he's a pathetic, snarling wretch. A brilliant portrayal in my opinion. I had also heard some complaints that the Phantom's deformity isn't ugly enough. I saw the film expecting something like a burn or something lame. I was again being cynical with the director, expecting sexiness to be stressed over what REALLY matters. So when we finally get a good look at the phantom after his mask and wig are pulled off I was surprised to see something that was actually pretty repulsive. I don't know what people were expecting to see, Freddy? The Elephant Man? Let's face it, if you saw someone like that walking down the street you'd be pretty shocked. This was before plastic surgery. It's easy to see how the Phantom would be forced to wear a mask and live under ground. The rest of the film was sublime. The costumes, the sets, the black & white flashbacks, Webber's soul stirring and often quite Gothic music, and of course the chandelier fall, which was brilliantly shot.Other little details like the Phantom's toy theater with dolls made to resemble characters from various operas, I felt were great touches. They allow you to see a little more of his personality. All in all, I am very pleased with the way this film came out. In fact the only thing I would have changed was the sword fight in the cemetery. I still love the flame shooting staff that Phantom had in the stage production and I do think it would have worked on film. My point is; I loved it. Forget the critics. Many of them have personal agendas anyway.

889919,A854E5FCL8X1I,B0007TKNI8,customer,"[0, 0]","Based on Andrew Lloyd Webber's  musical smash hit The Phantom of the Opera, Joel Schumacher adapts it to the big screen!In 2004, after nearly twenty years of waiting, a Phantom movie was being made. I was very excited! I already knew the music by heart after listening to the Original Cast Recording with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman literally dozens of times, and wondered how a movie version would turn out.After seeing it, I was blown away! The music is just as marvelous and catchy as ever. The film is full of color and amazing special effects that are a feast for the eyes.The cast includes Gerard Butler as the Phantom, Emmy Rossum as Christine, Patrick Wilson as Raoul, Minnie Driver as Carlotta, and Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry.Many fans of the stage musical expressed doubts about the film because of the fact that Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman did not reprise their roles as the Phantom and Christine respectively. I think the new cast does an excellent job. However, Crawford and Brightman are nearly irreplaceable in my opinion. Some also worried about the choice of Schumacher as director (who was responsible for the horrible 1997 film, Batman & Robin). I think Schumacher does much better with Phantom.Some other changes were made from the stage musical, including some revisions in the lyrics, some events were switched around, and some additional scenes were added to help bridge-the-gap where scene changes were in the stage version. Also, the Phantom's facial deformity is toned-down considerably from the original look.Overall, I thought this was a very good adaption of The Phantom of the Opera.

I've seen it 5+ times and never get tired of it.  I was a bit ancy when this film was released mostly because I've seen the movie and none of them compair to the play (although I will say that if you see any of the films the Argento's because instead of trying to recreate the atmosphere he creates his own and it works on a higher level).  When I heard that Emmy Rossum was playing Christine I got excited because I know she's good, and although I had heard nothing about this Butler guy playing the Phantom I figured he had to be good, right?  I do wish that Bandaras had played the Phantom since he has a brilliant voice, and my only complaint about this film is that Butler has a horrid voice, but as far as theatrics are concerned he plays a brilliant Phantom.  The film follows Andrew Lloyd Webber's play almost scene for scene execpt for one additional graveyard scene where the Phantom and Christines lover (Patrick Wilson) fight.  The sets the costumes and the acting, and for the most part the singing, is brilliant (Emmy Rossum is just out of this world) and it will leave you mezmerized!  Minnie Driver has one of my favorite roles as Carlotta and she is as histerical as she is wicked.  All in all it's Hollywood at it's best, with Schumacher doing a brilliant job bringing this classic to the big screen, and doing it better than anyone ever has.  I'm glad Emmy was cast, although Katie Holmes (who was origionally cast until she had to back out for another project) would have been good if not great, Emmy already has proven to have the pipes and I feel Katie wouldn't have been able to stack (although I hear that she was taking voice lessons for the role, and if you've seen Abandon then you'll know she can sing).

889926,A1X73UKO4S8EPV,B0007TKNI8,"Dan Tate ""Father, husband, son""","[5, 8]","Okay so many people have written reviews, however it is impossible to determine the qualifications...so here goes mine. I have read the original Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux, seen the musical 4 times; on Broadway (with Sarah Brightman singing Christine), London (with Michael Crawford singing the Phantom), San Francisco as well as the US Tour, I have also seen the movie twice and have read every book I can find about the Phantom of the Opera (both fiction and documentary accounts). So here is what I have to say about the movie.There will never be an acceptable substitute for seeing the musical, especially if neither Michael Crawford nor Sarah Brightman is playing in said movie. However, the movie doesn't do to bad. There are of course some complaints:1. Okay based on the movie, why in the world would the managers of the Opera Populaire ever consider putting Carlotta in when Christine has proven herself. In the musical Carlotta is truly is a fantastic singer; she just has an attitude problem. In the movie Carlotta is cast as a terrible singer with no talent on stage whatsoever, plus she is a pain! Come on, Carlotta should be a fantastic singer, that's why the managers have a hard time doing what the Phantom asks.2. Mannequin movie. When almost all of the characters sing, they have a tendency to stand there, still, or they are at least trying very hard to limit their movement. Just look at Christine when singing ""Think of Me"". A little more emotion would have made my day!3. Phantom...okay, first of all like a reviewer said earlier, Gerard Butler is just not Michael Crawford. The Phantom's character was written for Crawford, and you can't blame Butler for not satisfying Phantom Phreaks. I think he did a good job; he changed the vocals in all of the songs he sang to try and break away from Crawford comparisons and didn't do a bad job. But the movie gives the feeling that Raoul is a stronger man and character than the Phantom. I don't think so. In both the book and the movie Raoul is a hopeless romantic, whom could perhaps charm the socks of anyone, but couldn't fight to save his life. In the book he is constantly being saved by both the Persian and Madame Giry, in the musical Christine saves his life on more than one occasion. So in the movie, to have the Phantom loose in a swordfight to Raoul is simply wrong!4. The chandelier, because in the movie the chandelier doesn't fall until the end it requires a bunch of lyrical changes to the music, plus it humanizes the Phantom. In the musical and the book for that matter the chandelier falling is the first sign that the Phantom has become a very evil character. Okay so he stalks Christine and is scarily obsessive and possessive of her during the first act, but he stops at actually hurting someone. With the exception of Joseph Buquet, the account given by the musical doesn't indicate anybody being seriously injured as a result of the Phantom's mayhem. The chandelier is the point in which he loses control. Also the managers were very stubborn belligerent men, why (with the death of only one man) would they bow to the Phantom's will, when presented with Don Juan. In the musical and the book, the prospect of another chandelier crashing down on the heads of their customers convinces them to give in, even before Raoul comes up with is 'brilliant'plan.Okay enough with the bad...here's the good:1. Emmy Rossum is very good vocally as Christine. She does a very good job of portraying the growth that Christine experiences from her first performance on stage, to her performance with the Phantom in Don Juan. With the exception of little or no acting being done whilst singing, she does a great job of interacting with the both Raoul and especially with the Phantom. She does a great job, throughout the movie, of selling the love portrayed in the kiss at the end.2. I rather like the flashback theme throughout the movie; the end does a great job of leaving audiences thinking, and wondering.3. With the exception of the occasional changes (see above), they stayed very close to the score; those who listen to the Phantom often though may be annoyed or shocked with the speaking being done at time when singing is done during the musical. Relax, it's a movie!5. Some people didn't like the flashback that Madame Giry provides about the Phantom's past, and although it is inaccurate, it still provides a lot of insight towards the Phantom's feelings toward society, further explaining the line ""the world showed no compassion to me"". It was a necessary addition to the movie. Some people would have a hard time sympathizing with the Phantom if the visuals of his mistreatment were presented.4. It is very good. Overall the movie is worth spending money to see it in theatres, and again spending money to buy the DVD.",4,Un-biased and educated review,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,4817,"['Okay', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'written', 'reviews', 'however', 'impossible', 'determine', 'qualifications', 'so', 'here', 'mine', 'have', 'read', 'original', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', 'seen', 'musical', '4', 'times', 'Broadway', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'singing', 'Christine', 'London', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'singing', 'Phantom', 'San', 'Francisco', 'as', 'well', 'US', 'Tour', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'find', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'fiction', 'documentary', 'accounts', 'So', 'here', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'movie.There', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'acceptable', 'substitute', 'seeing', 'musical', 'especially', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'playing', 'said', 'movie', 'However', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'are', 'course', 'complaints:1', 'Okay', 'based', 'movie', 'why', 'world', 'would', 'managers', 'Opera', 'Populaire', 'ever', 'consider', 'putting', 'Carlotta', 'when', 'Christine', 'proven', 'musical', 'Carlotta', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'singer', 'just', 'attitude', 'problem', 'movie', 'Carlotta', 'cast', 'terrible', 'singer', 'talent', 'stage', 'whatsoever', 'pain', 'Come', 'Carlotta', 'should', 'be', 'fantastic', 'singer', 'why', 'managers', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'doing', 'what', 'Phantom', 'asks.2', 'Mannequin', 'movie', 'When', 'almost', 'characters', 'sing', 'have', 'tendency', 'stand', 'there', 'still', 'are', 'least', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'limit', 'movement', 'Just', 'look', 'Christine', 'when', 'singing', 'Think', 'Me', 'little', 'more', 'emotion', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'day', '3', 'Phantom', 'okay', 'first', 'reviewer', 'said', 'earlier', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'just', 'not', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'Phantom', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'Crawford', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Butler', 'not', 'satisfying', 'Phantom', 'Phreaks', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'changed', 'vocals', 'songs', 'sang', 'try', 'break', 'away', 'Crawford', 'comparisons', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'movie', 'feeling', 'Raoul', 'stronger', 'man', 'character', 'Phantom', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'book', 'movie', 'Raoul', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'whom', 'could', 'perhaps', 'charm', 'socks', 'anyone', 'could', ""n't"", 'fight', 'save', 'life', 'book', 'constantly', 'being', 'saved', 'Persian', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'musical', 'Christine', 'life', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'So', 'movie', 'have', 'Phantom', 'loose', 'swordfight', 'Raoul', 'simply', 'wrong', '4', 'chandelier', 'movie', 'chandelier', ""n't"", 'fall', 'end', 'bunch', 'lyrical', 'changes', 'music', 'Phantom', 'musical', 'book', 'matter', 'chandelier', 'falling', 'first', 'sign', 'Phantom', 'become', 'very', 'evil', 'character', 'Okay', 'Christine', 'scarily', 'obsessive', 'possessive', 'first', 'act', 'actually', 'hurting', 'someone', 'exception', 'Joseph', 'Buquet', 'account', 'given', 'musical', ""n't"", 'indicate', 'anybody', 'being', 'seriously', 'injured', 'result', 'Phantom', 'mayhem', 'chandelier', 'point', 'control', 'Also', 'managers', 'were', 'very', 'stubborn', 'belligerent', 'men', 'why', 'death', 'only', 'one', 'man', 'would', 'bow', 'Phantom', 'will', 'when', 'presented', 'Don', 'Juan', 'musical', 'book', 'prospect', 'chandelier', 'crashing', 'down', 'heads', 'customers', 'give', 'even', 'Raoul', 'up', ""'brilliant'plan.Okay"", 'enough', 'bad', 'here', 'good:1', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'very', 'good', 'vocally', 'Christine', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'growth', 'Christine', 'experiences', 'first', 'performance', 'stage', 'performance', 'Phantom', 'Don', 'Juan', 'exception', 'little', 'acting', 'being', 'done', 'whilst', 'singing', 'great', 'job', 'interacting', 'Raoul', 'especially', 'Phantom', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'selling', 'love', 'portrayed', 'kiss', 'end.2', 'rather', 'flashback', 'theme', 'movie', 'end', 'great', 'job', 'leaving', 'audiences', 'thinking', 'wondering.3', 'exception', 'occasional', 'changes', 'see', 'stayed', 'very', 'close', 'score', 'who', 'listen', 'Phantom', 'often', 'may', 'be', 'annoyed', 'shocked', 'speaking', 'being', 'done', 'time', 'when', 'singing', 'done', 'musical', 'Relax', 'movie', '5', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'flashback', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'Phantom', 'past', 'inaccurate', 'still', 'lot', 'insight', 'towards', 'Phantom', 'feelings', 'society', 'further', 'explaining', 'line', 'world', 'showed', 'compassion', 'was', 'necessary', 'addition', 'movie', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'sympathizing', 'Phantom', 'visuals', 'mistreatment', 'were', 'presented.4', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'worth', 'spending', 'money', 'see', 'theatres', 'again', 'spending', 'money', 'buy', 'DVD']",N/A

Patrick Wilson makes a dashing Raoul.  The real star of the show is Emmy Rossum as Christine.  This kind of breakout performance is once-in-a-bluemoon event.  Why wasn't she nominated for an Oscar?

This will either give me more credibility since I'm not reviewing this film as a diehard ""Phan"" or it will kill my credibility with those who choose to constantly compare it to the Broadway musical.Now for the review...Overall, I had to take one star away for the vocal problems apparent here and there in the film.  Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson all showed an amazing amount of guts to take on the roles so associated with the original cast.  And for the most part, their performances were moving.  I won't lie, I shed tears at the end of the film, I was so touched by the emotion, passion, and feeling in the performances.  The beginning of the film... I had shivers.  Simply put, an excellent job by these actors.However, as I said, there were some problems.  Both Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler seem to have problems with the full vocal range associated with opera.  I noticed both on the soundtrack and in the film that they struggled to hit or hold some of the notes, and it was very obvious, especially during the ""signature"" song of the production, that the music was being used to cover up the vocal imperfections of these two.  When the two sang ""Phantom of the Opera"", it was clear that they sadly were not comfortable or able to handle to vocal range necessary to make these songs work on all levels.  They simply lacked the vocal power.Despite that, most of their performances were excellent as I noted above.  I was very much impressed by the sets, the cast, and the costumes, with the notable exception of Ms. Rossum's costume during ""Phantom of the Opera""/""Music of the Night"".  The negligee was a bit too much (or too little as the case may be).  I can only wonder why Ms. Driver was not given the opportunity to sing as Carlotta and was dubbed?  I can only guess, based on her performance of ""Learn to Be Lonely"", that she was simply unable to pull off the vocals.  But her acting was flawless, and this can certainly be forgiven.If you're looking for THE definitive ""cover"" of the B'Way musical, you'll never find it.  If you choose to look at this as yet another version of ALW's vision, you'll probably enjoy it a great deal.  If you simply want to see good cinema, then you WILL enjoy this film, no qiestions asked.In the day and age of modern cinema where:1.  An ""epic"" is 95 minutes long with bad casting and even worse scripting and production,2.  Where blood and gore and mindless violence rules,3.  Remakes of J-Horror, Chinese Martial Arts imports, Tolkien novels and comic book remakes dominate the American movie lists because most original stuff is pure garbage (with the exception of Kill Bill),...this film is a complete breath of fresh air.  Rent it for the experience.  If you want extras, btw, get the two-disc edition.

889937,A3Q80Q6YFP5W6Q,B0007TKNI8,David Roy,"[4, 5]","I've been a big fan of the music from the stage production of Phantom of the Opera for a long time (yes, I know that makes me a Philistine to some of you), but I have never actually seen the musical.  However, on my trip home last week, I was able to catch the movie version and see a little bit of what I've been missing.  There have been lots of horror movies and other adaptations of the Phantom story, but this is the first one that is based on the musical.  It's a lavish production with a wonderful Christine (played by 16-year old Emmy Rossum) that is only let down by the two male leads.  Same music as the play for a fifth of the cost!Most people know the basic story, so I won't go into great detail.  Christine Daae is a novice singer at the Paris Opera House, taken in by Madame Giry when her father died.  She has been tutored in singing by someone she identifies as the ""Angel of Music"" who is really the Phantom, a horribly (ok, not that horribly, at least in the film) disfigured man who lives in the catacombs underneath the Opera House.  The Phantom has fallen in love with her, however, and is willing to kill in order to both win her heart and advance her career.  Mayhem ensues (but doesn't it always?), especially when the Opera House is taken over by new owners who don't quite understand the rules of the Phantom's game.  When Christine falls in love with a childhood friend, Raoul, the Phantom gets even crazier.The production values in the movie are almost breathtaking, with beautiful architecture and creepy water-filled catacombs.  The Phantom's underground lair is almost haunting with its small mock-up of the Opera House, and hidden alcove with his Christine mannequin in it.  Sweeping staircases abound, especially showcased in the ""Masquerade"" sequence.  The choreography is also great, especially during ""Masquerade"" and the final set piece, ""Point of No Return.""  For those who think Joel Schumacher and then think Batman & Robin, this movie will definitely remove that horrible image.  I thought almost everything about the production was wonderful.  Ok, Christine passes the same grave markers a few times during the cemetery scene, but the rest is almost perfect.Which brings us to the cast.  Emmy Rossum is quite the discovery and she has a magnificent voice, able to handle all the various songs with ease. She's beautiful (and she's 16, so watch out!) and can hold her own with her castmates.  Gerard Butler, as the Phantom, isn't quite as good.  Most of the songs he handles ably, but occasionally (mostly when he tries to be intense), he almost shouts the words rather than singing them, and his performance falls off the rails.  However, his turn with Christine during the ""Point of No Return"" is very good.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Patrick Wilson, the third major cast member.  I found his Raoul vapid and Wilson was trying too hard.  I didn't like his voice that much, and I really couldn't fathom what Christine saw in him (unless it was his long hair).  I don't think he has a solo in the movie, so he's always paired off with somebody, and he never comes out on top.  During the final sequence, when Christine has to choose, both he and Butler were going a bit too far, making me wish Christine had a third choice:  let them have each other instead of her.  But oh well.The rest of the cast is more minor, but all of them do a fabulous job with what they are given.  I've always loved Miranda Richardson (even more so when I remember how she played Queen Elizabeth in Black Adder, and then see her in a serious role) and she is great here too.  Simon Callow and Ciarin Hinds are funny as the two new theater owners, playing just this side of over the top (ok, just *that* side, but they were still good). And Minnie Driver, though she did not sing her role (she was dubbed) is pretty good as Carlotta, too, though the accent got a bit much after a while.There were a few problems with this movie, besides some of the cast.  Most of them were minor, almost nitpicks, but they did bring my opinion down a little bit.  First, if the Phantom is the guy who drives Christine to the cemetery, how did he get to the crypt ahead of her?  I know she was busy singing, but I would think she would have noticed him passing her.  Second, and this may have been caused by me watching this movie and my niece's Cinderella play in quick succession, what is the deal with musical characters falling in love at the drop of a hat?  Cinderella is *really* bad for this, because at least in Phantom the two characters are childhood friends.  But they meet for the first time in many years, and within a day or two, they are soulmates?  Still, that's a problem from the play (and perhaps even the book), so I won't harp on it too much, except it seems to always happen in musicals.  Finally, the constant interruptions by Raoul in the ""present day"" (the movie begins in the 1920s, while the story itself takes place in the 1880s) got tiresome after a while, and really didn't move the story along.  The beginning was good, and the ending was very fitting, but there could have been a few less in the middle of the movie.All in all, I really enjoyed Phantom of the Opera.  If you like the music, you could get the CD and imagine the play.  Or you can watch this movie for a fraction of the cost of the show and get to see it acted out in a pretty good way.  It's certainly worth a look.David Roy",4,The Phantom movie franchise takes a musical turn,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,5439,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'music', 'stage', 'production', 'Phantom',

889941,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B0007TKNI8,Deborah Earle,"[15, 16]","Producer/Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and director Joel Schumacher have further elevated the cult status of Gaston Leroux's 1911 penny-dreadful by finally turning Lloyd Webber's stellar 1986 stage musical into this lovely cinematographic masterpiece.Admittedly as of this writing, I've yet to see a live stage version of the musical, but as an owner of a copy of the original London cast recording of ""Phantom"" for 15 years  prior to seeing this film, I'd had the ""Phantom"" soundtrack in my head for years, and had always wondered what the film version would be like.As is the case with the stage production, liberties are taken with Leroux's novel in the film. The story of the Phantom's reign of terror begins in 1870 in this movie--nine years later than the original stage production, and eleven years earlier than in the novel. The physical appearance of some of the characters is derived from the stage musical rather than the novel as well.While I've regretted that Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman did not recreate their phenomenal onstage roles in this movie, I appreciate the sensibility of using younger actors.Scottish-born Gerard Butler's 6""2"" frame is naturally more imposing than that of the 5""10"" 1/2 Crawford's, and although I make mental comparisons between  the singing styles of Crawford and Butler, noting where Crawford's voice would have risen and/or become more breathy and sensuous, Butler is undeniably his own  man in that role, combining Crawford's  vocal sensuality with the boorish charisma of Russell Crowe. Butler's unmasked profile reveals a very attractive face with appropriately piercing eyes and a virile chin cleft.Young Soprano Emmy Rossum's lifelong experience in the world of opera shines through in her performance as Christine Daae. While she lacks the sweet, stratosphere-piercing strength of Sarah Brightman, her youth makes her more believable in the part. Her soprano has its own dulcet style, but a listener feels as the Phantom does that ""she has much still to learn"". Her naivte and vulnerability  are deeply felt as she confronts the issue of whether or not this ""Angel of Music"" is the one promised by her dying father in her childhood. But she can face down the Phantom with equal amounts of courage and defiance when necessary.Patrick Wilson sings the part of Raoul in softer and less vibrant tones than the late Steve Barton, but he is very expressive in his physical and vocal style, as he goes to great lengths to rescue the woman he loves.Minnie Driver is pompous and over-the-top as the diva, Carlotta Giudicelli, but sings the closing number warmly and beautifully.Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds (the latter of whom previously appeared with Driver in ""Circle of Friends"") seem comically out of their league as the opera house managers, Miranda Richardson is matronly as the Ballet Mistress and Phantom confidante, Madame Giry, and a fetching Jennifer Ellison plays her daughter, Meg, who is Christine's supportive best friend, justifyably thwarted in her efforts to confront the Phantom by her mother.The interspersed black and white scenes of the 1919 auction at the Paris Opera House gradually lend closure to the story.One accuracy of the film is the Phantom's escort of Christine to his private chambers partially on horseback. But inevitably I noted the deletion of a stanza from the title song. Like all the numbers, the show-stopping ""Music of the Night""  was admirably done, and one pays attention to the vastness of the shoes Butler had to fill especially in that scene.As the lonely malformed genius coaches Christine for stardom supernaturally, he demands the improvement of the quality of the productions from the managers. After the senseless murder of a stagehand who knew too much, Christine and Raoul comfort each other on the roof, hoping to be out of the Phantom's earshot.By the time of the New's Year's Masqued Ball,  they are secretly engaged. Ironically, the revelers sing of various colors  swirling about the room while clad mostly in black and white. On cue, the dreaded regularly-masked figure comes to poop the party and demand the performance of his own opera. Shortly afterwards, Madame Giry reluctantly recounts the history of her relationship with the Phantom, to give Raoul a bit more insight.A few scenes and one beautifully sung ballad later, the company prepare to take on the Phantom once and for all. But plans go awry, amid a fallen chandelier.  Christine plays her part to the hilt, especially in the dramatic build-up of the sexually charged ""Past the Point of No Return"".Shortly thereafter, Christine has to make a final decision to save Raoul's life, and committs an act of pity that moves her tormentor deeply.In the end, and emotional Raoul could feel somewhat bemused that his one-time detractor--who did evil things but was capable of arousing great sympathy--at least shared his taste in women.But the twist ending evokes the question: Is the music of the night ever really over?",5,EXQUISITE!

889945,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B0007TKNI8,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[1, 1]","Joel Schumacher has created a visually sumptuous film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's mega-hit stage musical ""The Phantom Of The Opera."" Several musical numbers (notably ""The Phantom Of The Opera,"" ""Music Of The Night"" and ""Masquarade"") are attractively staged for film. Emmy Rossum makes a comely Christine, and Gerard Butler is super sexy as The Phantom. Minnie Driver has several funny scenes as opera diva Carlotta, and Miranda Richardson is impressive as Madame Gury, seemingly the only soul who has any sympathy for the Phantom.But Schumacher, Butler, Rossum, etc. can not escape the fact that Webber's musical is incredibly shallow on several levels, no matter how hard they might try. When Rossum removes Butler's mask, he looks like a guy who has been burned a bit in a fire; or perhaps had acid thrown on one side of his face. His face does not appear ""distorted, hardly a face"" as Christine fearfully sings. Butler's Phantom is definitely not the horrifying, hideous creature that Lon Chaney was in the  original 1925 silent film classic. Butler's Phantom is a stud. True, Webber is going for musical romance here, not horror. Christine's rejection of the Phantom and her schmultzy love for pretty boy Patrick Wilson as Raoul makes her an incredibly, almost insufferably, shallow person. Could Patrick Wilson be any more bland than he is here? But no actor is to be blamed as much as Lord Lloyd Webber himself. His shallow songs (Wilson and Rossum sing the cringe-inducing love duet ""All I Ask Of You,"" for example) render the entire enterprise banal and emotionally vapid. And ""Phantom"" is still playing to packed houses, regardless of who is in the cast, for something over 22 years now. What can I say to that? Well, if audiences want to eat emotional vapidity for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Andrew Lloyd Webber is definitely the go-to guy.",3,"VISUALLY SUMPTUOUS, BUT ULTIMATELY SHALLOW, BANAL, AND VAPID",1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,1858,"['Joel', 'Schumacher', 'created', 'visually', 'sumptuous', 'film', 'version', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'mega-hit', 'stage', 'musical', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Several', 'musical', 'numbers', 'notably', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Music', 'Night', 'Masquarade', 'are', 'attractively', 'staged', 'film', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'comely', 'Christine', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'super', 'sexy', 'Phantom', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'several', 'funny', 'scenes', 'opera', 'diva', 'Carlotta', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'impressive', 'Madame', 'Gury', 'seemingly', 'only', 'soul', 'who', 'sympathy', 'Phantom.But', 'Schumacher', 'Butler', 'Rossum', 'etc', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'fact', 'Webber', 'musical', 'incredibly', 'shallow', 'several', 'levels', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'might', 'try', 'When', 'Rossum', 'Butler', 'mask', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'burned', 'bit', 'fire', 'perhaps', 'had', 'acid', 'thrown', 'one', 'side', 'face', 'face', 'not', 'appear', 'distorted', 'hardly', 'face', 'Christine', 'fearfully', 'sings', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'definitely', 'not', 'horrifying', 'hideous', 'creature', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'was', 'original', '1925', 'silent', 'film', 'classic', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'stud', 'True', 'Webber', 'going', 'musical', 'romance', 'here', 'not', 'horror', 'Christine', 'rejection', 'Phantom', 'schmultzy', 'love', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Raoul', 'incredibly', 'almost', 'insufferably', 'shallow', 'person', 'Could', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'be', 'more', 'bland', 'here', 'actor', 'be', 'blamed', 'as', 'much', 'Lord', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'shallow', 'songs', 'Wilson', 'Rossum', 'sing', 'cringe-inducing', 'love', 'duet', 'Ask', 'example', 'entire', 'enterprise', 'banal', 'emotionally', 'vapid', 'Phantom', 'still', 'playing', 'packed', 'houses', 'regardless', 'who', 'cast', 'something', '22', 'years', 'now', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'Well', 'audiences', 'want', 'eat', 'emotional', 'vapidity', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'definitely', 'go-to', 'guy']",N/A

889949,A7LXWJYEKPQTT,B0007TKNI8,D. J. Richardson,"[7, 13]","This movie let me down. I watched it more than once, liking it a little bit at first but then I couldn't handle the tweeks and alterations.  As a result, it seemed to get worse with each viewing.  The little differences just became too annoying to cope with.  I found myself enjoying the movie because I loved the play, not because I actually liked the movie.  I was continuously finding things worth changing and imagining parts that the movie never properly expressed.Faults:1. The phantom... not what I expected.  The guy is young, ""GQ"" and ridiculous.  Why not cast Fabio while they were are at it?  Feels like watching a cheesy romance novel put to film.  Phantom should be older, wiser, uglier - quite frankly.  His beauty is his talent, not his face.  The whole point is that he could woe Christine with his art alone, that music was enough to make her love him. Think Beauty and the Beast, with a tragic ending.2. The phantom sword fight...  why?  Was the story too dull for Hollywood?  Not enough action?  ...And if you are going to have the phantom fight, then make him win.  By making him lose, it destroys the rest of the story.  How can you be concerned about Raoul entering the dungeon beneath the opera house, when he has already proven he is the better fighter, when he has already conquered his enemy?  Not to mention the fact that it just makes the phantom look like a weakling.3. The actors show no real emotion... something very odd about it.  They appear stale, showing no conviction to match the wonderful singing.  Much better just to close your eyes and hear the music.4. What's with the story behind the phantom?  A kid on display at some freak show?  Not happy with that background info.  The phantom loses his mystery and his power, becoming a pathetic child to sympathize with for the wrong reasons.The good:1. The music - although... there are some slight differences here and there in the song structures that again make me ask, ""why??""Listen to the original recording of the music and remember the dark, edgy story that is taking place... sadly, I feel the magic is lost in this movie adaptation.  People have remarked on how beautiful the sets are... well, there is a problem with that, too.  I feel like I am watching plastic people in a plastic world.  A real gothic touch would be to show some more realism, and not just a polished and shiny package of ""pretty"" material.  It could have been darker, including the masquerade, which was kind of a let down...  There was a real chance to show a fantastic display.  Instead, everyone was wearing practically the same mask, with little imagination and fantasy present.A straight filming of the play itself, void of director's presence and alterations would be the ideal thing.  It would be like front row seats.  Bottom line, the play blows this movie out of the water and those who have never seen the play, and base their opinion of The Phantom of the Opera on this movie alone, are missing something very special.",2,"Loved the play... not the movie, unfortunately",1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,2997,"['movie', 'let', 'down', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'liking', 'little', 'bit', 'first', 'then', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'tweeks', 'alterations', 'result', 'seemed', 'get', 'worse', 'viewing', 'little', 'differences', 'just', 'became', 'too', 'annoying', 'cope', 'found', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'loved', 'play', 'not', 'actually', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'continuously', 'finding', 'things', 'worth', 'changing', 'imagining', 'parts', 'movie', 'never', 'properly', 'expressed.Faults:1', 'phantom', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'guy', 'young', 'GQ', 'ridiculous', 'Why', 'not', 'cast', 'Fabio', 'were', 'are', 'Feels', 'watching', 'cheesy', 'romance', 'novel', 'put', 'film', 'Phantom', 'should', 'be', 'older', 'wiser', 'uglier', 'quite', 'frankly', 'beauty', 'talent', 'not', 'face', 'whole', 'point', 'could', 'woe', 'Christine', 'art', 'alone', 'music', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'love', 'Think', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'tragic', 'ending.2', 'phantom', 'sword', 'fight', 'why', 'Was', 'story', 'too', 'dull', 'Hollywood', 'Not', 'enough', 'action', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'phantom', 'fight', 'then', 'make', 'win', 'making', 'lose', 'rest', 'story', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'concerned', 'Raoul', 'entering', 'dungeon', 'opera', 'house', 'when', 'already', 'proven', 'better', 'fighter', 'when', 'already', 'conquered', 'enemy', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'just', 'phantom', 'look', 'weakling.3', 'actors', 'show', 'real', 'emotion', 'something', 'very', 'odd', 'appear', 'stale', 'showing', 'conviction', 'match', 'wonderful', 'singing', 'Much', 'better', 'just', 'close', 'eyes', 'hear', 'music.4', 'What', 'story', 'phantom', 'kid', 'display', 'freak', 'show', 'Not', 'happy', 'background', 'info', 'phantom', 'mystery', 'power', 'becoming', 'pathetic', 'child', 'sympathize', 'wrong', 'reasons.The', 'good:1', 'music', 'are', 'slight', 'differences', 'here', 'there', 'song', 'again', 'make', 'ask', 'why', 'Listen', 'original', 'recording', 'music', 'remember', 'dark', 'edgy', 'story', 'taking', 'place', 'sadly', 'feel', 'magic', 'lost', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'People', 'have', 'remarked', 'how', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'are', 'well', 'problem', 'too', 'feel', 'am', 'watching', 'plastic', 'people', 'plastic', 'world', 'real', 'gothic', 'touch', 'would', 'be', 'show', 'more', 'realism', 'not', 'just', 'polished', 'shiny', 'package', 'pretty', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'darker', 'including', 'masquerade', 'was', 'kind', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'real', 'chance', 'show', 'fantastic', 'display', 'Instead', 'everyone', 'was', 'wearing', 'practically', 'same', 'mask', 'little', 'imagination', 'fantasy', 'present.A', 'straight', 'filming', 'play', 'void', 'director', 'presence', 'alterations', 'would', 'be', 'ideal', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'front', 'row', 'seats', 'Bottom', 'line', 'play', 'movie', 'water', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'play', 'base', 'opinion', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'movie', 'alone', 'are', 'missing', 'something', 'very', 'special']",N/A
889950,A3PGGPL7FM9F81,B0007TKNI8,Docendo Discimus,"[15, 15]","He lacks a little bit of depth and resonance, perhaps, especially on the lower notes, but Scottish actor Gerard Butler really doesn't sing ""like a meatloaf stuffed with garlic"", as one mean-spirited critic wrote. And when you consider the fact that he is not a trained singer, Butler fares very well as the Phantom. His vocals on the title song are a bit odd, and betray his normally heavy Scottish accent, but almost everything else is excellent.Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted a Phantom with ""some rock n' roll"" in him, not an opera singer or anything along those lines, and while Gerry Butler (as he prefers to be known) does fall short of Michael Crawford's definitive vocal performance as the title character, his acting is very, very good, and he imbues the masked Phantom with plenty of genuine passion.The script stays relatively close to the original stage show, with a few minor changes in dialogue and for the sake of pace. And the movie is visually stunning, from the Phantom's underground lair to the mascarade. Terrific orchestrations, too, and Minnie Driver, whose voice is overdubbed for the operatic parts, is irresistable as leading lady Carlotta Giudicelli.This particular character has all the makings of a one-dimensional clich&eacute;, but Driver's performance is charming and just suitably over-the-top.And Emmanuelle Rossum...! Director Joel Schumacher wanted a young cast, and the casting of then-16-year-old soprano Emmy Rossum is a stroke of genius. Mature beyond her years, she possesses a natural beauty and a fabulous singing voice, genuine ""bel canto"" with a sweet, lyrical timbre. Some sopranos come off sounding more like a musical instrument than an actual human being, but Rossum's is a young girl's voice, smooth and lovely. I can't even think of anyone to compare her with...soubrette Reri Grist, perhaps, who sang opposite Fischer-Dieskau in ""Don Giovanni"", and performed the soprano part in the final movement of Mahler's Fourth Symphony in Bernstein's classic Columbia recording.""The Phantom of the Opera"" is Andrew Lloyd Webber's masterpiece...the score is filled with lovely melodies, well-wrought opera pastiches and grand arias. Emmy Rossum's performance of ""Think Of Me"" is breathtaking, and hers and Gerry Butler's rendition of ""The Point Of No Return"" is a highlight in, well, the history of musicals. I know that a lot of people had hoped to see Michael Crawford as the Phantom, and while the combination of Crawford's and Rossum's voices would have been incredible, Crawford was 61 when shooting began, and a 61-year-old Phantom opposite a 16-year-old Christine would probably have been a bit much, even as youthful and charming a 61-year-old as the great Mr Crawford is.And while Gerry Butler may not be the greatest singer ever to take on the rle of the Phantom of the Opera, he is actually pretty high on my list, and his abilities as an actor make up for everything that may be missing vocal-wise. Really, they do. There are some genuinely touching moments along the way, and all of them involve Butler.I know there'll be plenty of people who will dislike this movie because it's not excactly like the show, and Gerry Butler isn't Michael Crawford.

By the end of the film, I was just as into it, and feeling just as sympathetic for the Phantom, as I always did.Additionally, I really loved the costumes, though some may think they were over the top, and especially the Primma Donna. In contrast, I thought Christine's costumes were too bland. I think they could have capture Christine's purity with better gowns, either that or they should have brought the Primma Donna's costumes down a peg... but then again, she did provide the comic relief, which wasn't really there, before.I went and looked at some of the negative reviews, and I have to agree with what a lot of them are saying.

It's filled with eye-candy sets & props that take us back to the late 19th century France.  Everything about the film is well done & top notch, from the singing to the acting.  The casting department deserves plenty of accolades.The story itself is a take-off on the beauty & the beast motif.  Fans of this somewhat repeated theme are sure to like this movie.

Tercho ""Sassy Gal""","[10, 10]","I've seen this movie four times so far and it keeps getting better!Anyone who -really- knows and understands the Phantom story, and particularly  ALW's version, will love this movie.I have seen the Play numerous times on Broadway and in traveling troupes and my main concern was that they would make the movie completely unlike the play.My worries were unfounded.Andrew Lloyd Webber did an excellent job of keeping the fantastic music almost the same and the creative control he kept over the whole production kept the movie as close to the beloved play as possible.I too am a big fan of both Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman and I would have LOVED to see them in this movie, however it didn't work that way and to attempt to compare those who did star in the movie with the original actors is unfair.I feel that the entire cast in the movie did an excellent job.Gerard Butler's (phantom) voice (more of a rock feel) was a perfect compliment/contrast to Patrick Wilson (Raoul's) beautiful lyric tenor.I have to applaud Patrick, for I really -believed- in his love for Christine.Emmy Rossum (Christine) did a remarkable job and has an extremely pretty voice and she brought a very refreshing innocence to the role.Minnie Driver as Carlotta was FANTASTIC! She was, as intended in the character, over the edge and flamboyant!'Meg' was wonderfully portrayed, as well as 'Madame Giry' and the Managers.Anyone with a heart would shed tears at the incredibly sad ending.Again, anyone who really understands the story, has compassion on the plight of the tragic love triangle and who loves the music from either the CD or the play, will enjoy this movie.Someone mentioned the black and white scenes looking 'cheap'.They were supposed to look that way, to give a feel of what motion pictures, in their infancy, were like.It was also Raoul's memories; and it took place in the early 1900s.  It's not supposed to look perfectly modern!Overall, the movie is brilliant.It gives the feel of the Victorian Age, yet deals with the timeless subject, that most of us can relate to, and that is that no one wants or deserves to live a life devoid of love.And, I hope the story makes us examine ourselves and our prejudices for those we consider 'ugly' or 'different'",5,WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,2251,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'four', 'times', 'so', 'far', 'getting', 'better', 'Anyone', 'who', 'knows', 'Phantom', 'story', 'particularly', 'ALW', 'version', 'will', 'love', 'movie.I', 'have', 'seen', 'Play', 'numerous', 'times', 'Broadway', 'traveling', 'troupes', 'main', 'concern', 'was', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'completely', 'play.My', 'worries', 'were', 'unfounded.Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'keeping', 'fantastic', 'music', 'almost', 'same', 'creative', 'control', 'kept', 'whole', 'production', 'kept', 'movie', 'close', 'beloved', 'play', 'possible.I', 'too', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'would', 'have', 'LOVED', 'see', 'movie', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'attempt', 'compare', 'who', 'did', 'star', 'movie', 'original', 'actors', 'unfair.I', 'feel', 'entire', 'cast', 'movie', 'did', 'excellent', 'job.Gerard', 'Butler', 'phantom', 'voice', 'more', 'rock', 'feel', 'was', 'perfect', 'compliment/contrast', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Raoul', 'beautiful', 'lyric', 'tenor.I', 'have', 'applaud', 'Patrick', 'really', '-believed-', 'love', 'Christine.Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Christine', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'extremely', 'pretty', 'voice', 'brought', 'very', 'refreshing', 'innocence', 'role.Minnie', 'Driver', 'Carlotta', 'was', 'FANTASTIC', 'was', 'intended', 'character', 'edge', 'flamboyant', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'as', 'well', ""'Madame"", 'Giry', 'Managers.Anyone', 'heart', 'would', 'shed', 'tears', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'ending.Again', 'anyone', 'who', 'really', 'story', 'compassion', 'plight', 'tragic', 'love', 'triangle', 'who', 'music', 'CD', 'play', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie.Someone', 'mentioned', 'black', 'white', 'scenes', 'looking', ""'cheap'.They"", 'were', 'supposed', 'look', 'way', 'give', 'feel', 'what', 'motion', 'pictures', 'infancy', 'were', 'like.It', 'was', 'also', 'Raoul', 'memories', 'took', 'place', 'early', '1900s', 'not', 'supposed', 'look', 'perfectly', 'modern', 'Overall', 'movie', 'brilliant.It', 'feel', 'Victorian', 'Age', 'yet', 'deals', 'timeless', 'subject', 'most', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'live', 'life', 'devoid', 'love.And', 'hope', 'story', 'examine', 'prejudices', 'consider', ""'ugly""]",N/A

Like a gilt-edged dream, Joel Schumacher's ""Phantom of the Opera"" is a triumphant love note to beauty, song and scenery.Adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical (and Gaston Leroux's novel), this movie ends up being beautiful in every scene, with solid acting and and a tragic antihero. The singing, the sumptuous sets, the acting -- all are the ingredients of a musical tour de force.In 1870, a Paris opera house is under new management -- just as diva Carlotta (Minnie Driver, a glorious diva-from-hell) is almost killed by a stage curtain, and stomps out. Fortunately Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum), taught by a mystery tutor, can take over the soprano's role, and soon becomes famous for her singing. Even better, it catches the attention of her childhood sweetheart, Vicomte Raoul (Patrick Wilson).But Raoul doesn't realize that Christine was taught by a disfigured, tortured genius who hides under the opera house. And the Phantom of the Opera is not only determined that Christine should be the star, but also be his wife. And he's willing to kill for it. Can Raoul break the Phantom's hold over Christine, or will she embrace ""the music of the night""?Watching this, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same guy who did ""Phone Booth"" and the awful ""Batman and Robin."" Instead it looks as if the love child of Jean Cocteau and Peter Jackson decided to direct a musical, swathed in masks, roses, gilt angels, snow and velvet.And it all wraps around Webber's solid songs (""Turn your face away from the garish light of day/turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light/and listen to the music of the night!"") from the stage musical. Most of the lines are sung, which surprisingly doesn't detract from their believability. And there's plenty of fun with the cameras, whether it's the dizzying views of the backstage, or a zoom through a stone floor to the Phantom's face.Schumacher also adds a few extra scenes, including a sword fight between Raoul and the Phantom, which makes the vicomte seem more passionate; and a flashback to the Phantom's horrific childhood. What's more, the story is framed by scenes from forty years later -- sepia-toned scenes in the dusty remains of the Opera.The three most prominent roles are what make or break this movie, and in this case, the casting is nearly ideal. Rossum has the ingenue looks -- and the powerful pipes -- to carry off the role of Christine, torn between her love and her passion. Similarly, Patrick Wilson gives some brains and strength to Raoul, and despite the romantic appeal of the Phantom, Raoul isn't hard to cheer for.Gerard Butler is a bit more difficult. Most of the time his singing is solid, and his acting is powerful and tragic as the ""loathsome gargoyle, who burns in hell, but secretly yearns for heaven."" The scene where he tries to seduce Christine is deeply sensual. But occasionally his performance gets really hammy, such as the unmasking, where he flings himself around screaming, ""You little prying Pandora! You little demon!""Lush, exquisite and passionate, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a solid adaptation of Webber's musical, with good acting and excellent direction.

889978,A1XC099UZR8591,B0007TKNI8,"East West ""Don Quijotee""","[2, 2]","I loved this movie for its story, its color, vibrancy, emotion and touch. On first view I will admit that the voices seemed peculiar, but not so different from the stage production. On subsequent viewings the story comes out deep, rich and provocative. It is a wonderful adaptation and filled with rich imagery expected from film while retaining the essence of its stage production origins.This is a tragedy of heart. Circumstance has brought these players together. Let's call it fate and all are the supporting cast to this masquerade, but central is the love triangle which will always be shared from behind every shadow by Roul, the Phantom, with Christine in the middle, forever touch by the Phantoms gift of music. The phantom, despite his raging anger, jealous sensitivities, self-esteem issues, deceptions and violent outburst (sometimes resulting in murder), is in the end a sympathetic character. I am sure many of us can sympathize with loving someone more than they love us. Some of us have even played our own simple games of deception (or denial) in order to hold onto any thread of connections alive, only in the end being futile and painful when the object of our affections finds their one true love. The Phantom plays this childish game, being loved (and feared) for what he can do for/to others, he is fooled into believing that love is what he can control and not what is felt, albeit feeling it all the while.This is a wonderful story, although filled with adult themes which may be even too emotionally charge and morally contradicting for most children and teens. Be prepared to cry yourself.How can you love, fear, hate, admire, respect and pity someone all at the same time is the dilemma of Christine, the focus of the Phantom's twisted ambitions and his one true love? The two share many years together, although never meeting, while the phantom pretends to be the spirit of Christine's fathers long since passed away. And, so, these two are forever entwined. And it is this journey which forever binds Christine and the Phantom in both love or tragedy.I was moved to tears as the ending theme song reminds us of the eternal solitude the Phantom must bare, having tasted love for all of a brief moment while his hidden unrequited perpetual yearning for one woman's love continues beyond his failed attempts to own her. And it is this fatal love which haunts all (Roul, Christine & Phantom) to their graves long after the opera house was burned and the object of their love, Christine, has died and the suitors, all the while aware of each other and that she loved them both although only one was fortunate enough to enjoy the fulfillment of her devotions. A bitter sweet triangle reminiscent of Serrano De Bergerac.The story is filled with emotion and it is the story which makes the movie so rich and fulfilling. Christine and Roul were separated by a family tragedy, but have never lost the sweetness of their young love. The Phantom, abandoned by his mother and enslaved and brutalized by a gypsy circus an mockingly displayed as `the Devil's Child' gains freedom by murdering his abusive capture and foreshadowing his ""lust for blood"". He is saved by a patron to his side show, a young ballet student (Madame Gyri) who  feels sympathy for his treatment and hastily hides him away at the opera house. It is there he develops into a man. And it is certain that the exaggerations of the operatic stage productions (themes being typically murder, betrayal, etc.) and the quirky lifestyles of the stage performers are likely relevant to why the Phantom is so emotionally charged and dramatic in nature.Equaling fulfilling is the excellent editing as the moving flows along, never boring, always engaging, foreshadowing and directing the audience just enough to add meaning to future events, but in the end allowing enough mystery to set the imagination free to conclude the story as one personally desires. The costuming is just as outrageous as you would expect from the real world fantasy of stage productions. The movie adaptation adds continuity, special and chronological which can only be alluded to in the stage production which adds greatly to understanding the story and plot. Flashbacks are also used to provide both chronological and emotional clarity to the script and add a rich depth to the performance and emotional story line by eliciting form the audience some self-reflection as to both the control and uncontrolled fateful courses of their lives.And thus the story begins. Each member of our love triangle has grown to adulthood, full of life and hope yet Christine and the Phantom are haunted by their own tragedies. They are all about to be reborn through a trial of fire centered around the Phantoms misguided beliefs that he must deceive wantonly to be accepted and that control will bring him love ...and ironically, accomplish all this from among the shadows, afraid of revealing his deforming birth defect. The Phantom's existence becomes more production than reality. Perhaps this is why the Phantom is willing to destroy the essence of his soul ...his music and the opera house which is the stage for his life's purpose. And all this rage which has ""turn into madness"" is thus magnified by his budding manhood's violent jealousy, further `distorting' his soul and driving away his love.",5,"Hate, Love and Forgiveness

889982,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0007TKNI8,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 7]","The inarguable victory of this 2004 film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking stage hit is the artistry behind the elaborate sets, which can be credited primarily to art director Anthony Pratt and set decorator Celia Bobak. Otherwise your enjoyment of the film will depend on how much you love Lloyd Webber's music and the rapt romanticism at the heart of the old Gaston Leroux story. Personally, I much prefer the sheer musicality of Rodgers and Hammerstein, the razzle-dazzle of Ebb and Kander or the incisive witticism of Sondheim before giving a listen to Lloyd Webber's mostly overwrought work. His personal stamp is so indelible here that director Joel Schumacher's chief role seems to be to not get in the way with his own well-known commercially driven and often artistically deprived instincts.Regardless, I have to give credit to Lloyd Webber for his original inspiration to transform a standard horror story with Freudian implications into a swooning romantic operetta. On that level, the story succeeds in both live and filmed versions. Unfortunately, the journey from stage to screen is far more problematic beginning with the 1980's-sounding musical arrangements which severely date the movie. Surprisingly, no effort was made to update the sound of several musical numbers that have insistent electronic drum beats more fitting in a Studio 54-type venue. Another problem is the black-and-white framing device set in 1919 that Schumacher uses to treat the 1870-set story like a memory flashback. This technique is overused not only at the beginning and the end but at various unnecessary points throughout the film. Moreover, the movie feels overlong at 143 minutes, as Schumacher's storytelling feels lethargic and oddly underdeveloped, especially when compared to a live performance. There is a feeling of endlessness during the final stretch that proves exhausting despite the melodramatic resolution.Casting is also a challenge here but not because the three leads, all talented singers, are relative newcomers to films. Gerard Butler has the unenviable task of attempting to eradicate Michael Crawford's legendary stage performance as the Phantom. He is a rather lunkish presence for such a dashing, shadowy figure, and as a singer, he is somewhat of a shouter unable to display much emotional nuance. Butler becomes more effective in the final act but merely because he seems liberated after his character's unmasking. As the pursued Christine, Emmy Rossum is a lovely presence with a bright, bell-like soprano singing voice. Interestingly though, she is more successful as an actress than a singer here since her arias feel somewhat vacuous and worse, start to feel repetitive as the movie goes on. Patrick Wilson - memorable as the closeted Joe Pitt in Mike Nichols' ""Angels in America"" - has the looks and voice to play Raoul effectively, but he seems misguided here as his character alternates between heroism and vengeance in a mercurial fashion that should be reserved for the Phantom.Far more effective in supporting roles are  Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, the woman who seems to know all the secrets; Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Simon Callow as Firmin and Andre, the new owners of the Opera House; and Minnie Driver at her most flamboyantly comical as the reigning opera diva Carlotta speaking a most unrecognizable Neapolitan accent. Ultimately, the Baroque nature of the film's story, coupled with its gothic setting, still feels at odds with the Broadway-style musical numbers with the exception of the lovely rooftop duet between Rossum and Wilson on ""All I Ask of You"", as beautiful a ballad to come from Lloyd Webber as any of his other hits. At the same time, those who were enthralled with the stage version should find enough to please them with this version. For me, it was simply an underwhelming experience.",3,Opulent But Short-Sighted Adaptation of the Love-It-or-Hate-It Andrew Lloyd Webber Hit,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,3864,"['inarguable', 'victory', '2004', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'record-breaking', 'stage', 'hit', 'artistry', 'elaborate', 'sets', 'can', 'be', 'credited', 'primarily', 'art', 'director', 'Anthony', 'Pratt', 'set', 'decorator', 'Celia', 'Bobak', 'Otherwise', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'will', 'depend', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'music', 'rapt', 'romanticism', 'heart', 'old', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', 'story', 'Personally', 'much', 'prefer', 'sheer', 'musicality', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'razzle-dazzle', 'Ebb', 'Kander', 'incisive', 'witticism', 'Sondheim', 'giving', 'listen', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'mostly', 'overwrought', 'work', 'personal', 'stamp', 'so', 'indelible', 'here', 'director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'chief', 'role', 'be', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'own', 'well-known', 'commercially', 'driven', 'often', 'artistically', 'deprived', 'instincts.Regardless', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'original', 'inspiration', 'transform', 'standard', 'horror', 'story', 'Freudian', 'implications', 'swooning', 'romantic', 'operetta', 'level', 'story', 'live', 'filmed', 'versions', 'Unfortunately', 'journey', 'stage', 'screen', 'far', 'more', 'problematic', 'beginning', ""1980's-sounding"", 'musical', 'arrangements', 'severely', 'date', 'movie', 'Surprisingly', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'update', 'sound', 'several', 'musical', 'numbers', 'have', 'insistent', 'electronic', 'drum', 'more', 'fitting', 'Studio', '54-type', 'venue', 'problem', 'black-and-white', 'framing', 'device', 'set', '1919', 'Schumacher', 'treat', '1870-set', 'story', 'memory', 'flashback', 'technique', 'overused', 'not', 'only', 'beginning', 'end', 'various', 'unnecessary', 'points', 'film', 'Moreover', 'movie', 'overlong', '143', 'minutes', 'Schumacher', 'storytelling', 'feels', 'lethargic', 'oddly', 'underdeveloped', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'live', 'performance', 'feeling', 'endlessness', 'final', 'stretch', 'exhausting', 'melodramatic', 'resolution.Casting', 'also', 'challenge', 'here', 'not', 'three', 'leads', 'talented', 'singers', 'are', 'relative', 'newcomers', 'films', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'unenviable', 'task', 'attempting', 'eradicate', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'legendary', 'stage', 'performance', 'Phantom', 'rather', 'lunkish', 'presence', 'dashing', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'singer', 'somewhat', 'shouter', 'unable', 'display', 'much', 'emotional', 'nuance', 'Butler', 'more', 'effective', 'final', 'act', 'merely', 'liberated', 'character', 'unmasking', 'pursued', 'Christine', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'lovely', 'presence', 'bright', 'bell-like', 'soprano', 'singing', 'voice', 'Interestingly', 'more', 'successful', 'actress', 'singer', 'here', 'arias', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'vacuous', 'worse', 'start', 'feel', 'repetitive', 'movie', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'memorable', 'closeted', 'Joe', 'Pitt', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Angels', 'America', 'looks', 'voice', 'play', 'Raoul', 'effectively', 'misguided', 'here', 'character', 'heroism', 'vengeance', 'mercurial', 'fashion', 'should', 'be', 'reserved', 'Phantom.Far', 'more', 'effective', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'woman', 'who', 'know', 'secrets', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Firmin', 'Andre', 'new', 'owners', 'Opera', 'House', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'most', 'flamboyantly', 'comical', 'reigning', 'opera', 'diva', 'Carlotta', 'speaking', 'most', 'unrecognizable', 'Neapolitan', 'accent', 'Ultimately', 'Baroque', 'nature', 'film', 'story', 'coupled', 'gothic', 'setting', 'still', 'odds', 'Broadway-style', 'musical', 'numbers', 'exception', 'lovely', 'rooftop', 'duet', 'Rossum', 'Wilson', 'Ask', 'beautiful', 'ballad', 'come', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'other', 'hits', 'same', 'time', 'who', 'were', 'enthralled', 'stage', 'version', 'should', 'find', 'enough', 'please', 'version', 'was', 'simply', 'underwhelming', 'experience']",N/A

Some amazing acting in this, I thought. The Phantom and Christine were cast well. (The girl playing Christine was only 16 when this was filmed!) You feel for the Phantom, and understand Christine's temptation. Minnie Driver as Carlotta was really funny. My only complaint was that Patrick Wilson was a little too soft-faced and perfect-looking for his part.Plot: 5 of 5 stars. Enough plot to analyze, but not enough to get lost in. There's lots of intrigue, musical numbers, action, pathos, and romance. The end result of the story is very powerful. It's easy to see why this is such a beloved musical on Broadway.Cinematography: 4 of 5 stars.

I found it to be memorable and exciting, though all the songs kind of melded to be indistinguishable one from the other.Impact: 5 of 5 stars.

Learning for us is a thrill, and having subtitles that we can read allows us to understand, sing along, and deeply internalize messages. The Phantom of the Opera provides a magnificent tale of love, tragedy, and the perennial struggle between good and evil. A ghost terrorizes those that work or visit a French Opera House. But at the same time, this ghost tutors a chorus girl to sing like an angel. His angel of the night. By driving the leading soprano crazy, he is able to encourage that his prot&eacute;g&eacute; be center stage. And she renders a brilliant performance. Phantom loves her, but Christine does not return his affection. Falling in love with the Vicomte de Chagny, Christine breaks Phantom's heart.

889996,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B0007TKNI8,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[6, 6]","""The Phantom of the Opera"" (2004) is a visually spectacular film which remains loyal to the stage production despite some changes to the characters and story. The set design and costumes are sumptuous and Webber's music is beautiful..The cast, for the most part is excellent. The standout performer is Emmy Rossum who gives an praise worthy performance as the young soprano Christine Daa&eacute;. Although her voice is no match to the others who have played the role on stage such as the sublime Rebecca Caine, Sierra Boggess, Rebecca Luker, Claire Moore to name a few it is still lovely. Her tone is delicate and sweet (""Angel of Music"") and at times powerful (the cadenza at the end of ""Think of Me"") and many times throughout the score, she achieves moments of great vocal beauty (the rooftop scene). She breezes through most of the score effortlessly with a few exceptions (there are moments of strain during the ""Think of Me"" and during the Phantom's ""Point of No Return""). I always keep in mind that she is probably one of the youngest sopranos to ever perform these songs. All the other (stage) Christine's have been at least 10 years older than Miss Rossum and to have someone this young sing these songs is impressive as the score calls for the singer to jump octaves and sing high B's,  C's and E's (in this case an E flat). Her physical presence is also worth noting. Physically she is the perfect Christine as her age and look is suited well for the role. Admittedly, I have not read the original novel but I am suspecting Ms. Daa&eacute; of Leroux's imagination was close in age to Rossum. If not, she should have been, as it is far more believable to have a young girl, not yet reaching true maturity, succumb to the Phantom's influence.The title role was given to Gerard Butler who gives a strong dramatic performance but vocally, he is the weakest singer in the bunch. His voice is still competent in parts but many will argue a Phantom with a weak voice is not believable to which they have a point since it is he who teaches Christine how to sing however, like in Rossum's case and since film is a different medium, suspension of disbelief must come into play. If not, the hard-nosed critic will most likely have a difficult time listening to Butler struggle with most of the score. Another distraction that may or will arise is Butler's looks since his Phantom looks more of a Harlequin romance version and not the grotesque creature originally portrayed in the novel or the countless horror films the book inspired. Since this is the musical ""Phantom"" and not the horror-esque version of the 20's, 40's, 60's and 80's, it works for me. He is not suppose to scare the pants off the audience. If it's scares you want then I suggest you stick with Lon Chaney. Lloyd Weber's Phantom is suppose to seduce the audience and make the audience sympathize with him and Mr. Butler succeeds. Webber himself has stressed in earlier interviews that what attracted him to this piece was the romance, not the hokey horror tale. So while other versions focus on the horror, this one focuses on the romance.Others in the cast include Patrick Wilson who turns in a solid performance as the love-struck but rather wooden Raoul. His voice is good yet his character remains the least sympathetic despite the film-makers attempt to make him more interesting than his stage counterpart. Minnie Driver's over-the-top but hilarious portrayal of the diva and Christine rival ""La Carlotta"" is a scene stealer. Driver was the only cast member who did not do her own singing.Directed by the now infamous-for-putting-nipples-on-Batman-Joel Schumacher, the film is an assault on the senses. The elaborate sets, the glittering costumes, the cinematography are all spectacular and beautiful to behold and Webber's score is gorgeous. Many of Webber's simplest tunes turn out to be his most beautiful works. In the case here, the hauntingly beautiful ""Angel of Music"" is a standout. This song is repeated throughout the musical and the lovely tune is enhanced by Rossum's delicate soprano and fantastic orchestrations. Other musical highlights include the title track (although many have expressed disappointment in the omission of the last verse), the energetic ""Masquerade"", the lovely duet ""All I Ask of You"" (which is spectacular on film) and the Phantom's opera ""Don Juan Triumphant"" followed by what many call one of Webber's best tunes ""Point of No Return"".The film was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Song and Best Art Direction at the 2005 Oscars. It also received 3 Golden Globes nominations (including Best Picture), 2 Critics Choice award nominations (including Best Picture) and 11 Golden Satellite Awards nominations (including Best Picture). Although the film did not win any of the major awards Emmy Rossum won the National Board of Review Award for her performance in the film, as well as a Critics Choice award which was well deserved.The 2 disc DVD contains a making of documentary which is interesting enough, the theatrical trailer and if you do some investigative work, you should discover an easter egg. The one disc DVD's contain only the trailer as an extra.For the millions of fans who have not experienced Schumacher's vision of Andrew Lloyd Webbers musical, do not hesitate. It is a glorious production that does the stage show justice despite some cast controversy and narrative changes. It is a remarkable documentation of the show and as a movie musical, it is almost perfect. Musical theatre has never been this spectacular.",5,Face the Music.

I have never seen the actual stage presentation of the musical, so this was a treat to watch in on the big screen. Like many of the other reviewers, I felt like this adaptation of the musical pulls off the big screen feel that this work should have.Another reason this version thrives is that the movie did not diminish or impede LeRoux's original novel. This could have been another lame attempt by Hollywood to take a story from a novel and ""dumb"" it down, adding unnecessary plot details and overdone scenes. Thankfully that didn't happen, and the gothic/ horror feel is depicted successfully.The singing is superb and I felt like the movie was well cast. Emmy Rossum exerts a successful job as Christine Daae and Gerard Butler does as well also as the Phantom. With the way the film is produced and directed, it is not hard to ""get into"" the head of specific characters.Sometimes it is the small aspects that make movies a grade better than the rest. The way the producers used the black and white screen to flash ahead to another time at the movie's outset, and then periodically go back to this, was uniquely satisfying, and helps the story along. It also made the transitions back into LeRoux's story even more effective. Also, the cinematography and visual effects aid in exemplifying the essential themes of the story: love, hate, jealousy, inner beauty, despair, isolation, hope. These all come forth in the grand chandelier scene, the cemetery scene with Christine, the isolation of the Phantom in his chambers, and the magnificent opera scenes.Finally, there is a successful transition from Broadway musical to movie.

When the movie ended, though, it received applause from the audience -- that speaks for itself because, come on, how often do you get applause anymore these days for movies?  (In Los Angeles, mind you.)Strangely enough, right after listening to the chorus of cheers, I walked out and listened to a young woman complain: ""I take back what I said about her [Emmy Rossum] sounding like a 16-year-old, she sounds like a 12-year-old.""  Personally, I wanted to take her aside and ask her whether she knew what a 'soprano' is or not, that sopranos are supposed to sing high, and the character of Christine called for a soprano... but that's a story for another day.So there you have it.  Some loved it, some hated it.

Critics and the like have a reputation for snubbing him, but still, his works appeal to those of us with more common tastes, it seems, which is just fine by me.  Even more amusing is that while Roger Ebert slammed the movie, he perplexed even himself by still recommending it towards the end of his review because of the sheer spectacle and look of the film is undeniably fantastic.The look of the film is fantastic.  It's gorgeous, the sets are gorgeous, the costumes are gorgeous, and the so are the actors.  Some may say while it's got appearance, it lacks substance, but seriously, one could have said the same for Moulin Rouge.  Both are rather simplistic stories with high-amped visuals.The movie remains rather faithful to the theater version and serves as a wonderful way to make up for not seeing Phantom on stage.",4,"Mixed reaction in theater, but I loved it",1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,2214,"['who', 'just', 'love', 'theatrics', 'lush', 'beauty', 'drama', 'theater', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'movie', 'However', 'reaction', 'film', 'received', 'movie', 'theater', 'attended', 'best', 'sums', 'overall', 'reception', 'forty', 'minutes', 'film', '4-5', 'people', 'walked', 'theater', 'When', 'movie', 'ended', 'received', 'applause', 'audience', 'because', 'come', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'get', 'anymore', 'days', 'movies', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'mind', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'right', 'listening', 'chorus', 'cheers', 'walked', 'out', 'listened', 'young', 'woman', 'complain', 'take', 'back', 'what', 'said', '[', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', ']', 'sounding', '16-year-old', '12-year-old', 'Personally', 'wanted', 'take', 'aside', 'ask', 'knew', 'what', ""'soprano"", 'not', 'sopranos', 'are', 'supposed', 'sing', 'high', 'character', 'Christine', 'called', 'soprano', 'story', 'day.So', 'there', 'have', 'loved', 'hated', 'love', 'entertainment', 'forms', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'subscribe', 'elitist', 'lot', 'movie', 'snobs', 'tend', 'display', 'absolutely', 'fell', 'love', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'same', 'quote', 'used', 'describe', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'here', 'describe', 'movie', 'Let', 'face', 'one', 'world', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'public', 'Critics', 'like', 'have', 'reputation', 'snubbing', 'still', 'works', 'appeal', 'more', 'common', 'tastes', 'just', 'fine', 'Even', 'more', 'amusing', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'slammed', 'movie', 'perplexed', 'even', 'still', 'recommending', 'end', 'review', 'sheer', 'spectacle', 'look', 'film', 'undeniably', 'fantastic.The', 'look', 'film', 'fantastic', 'gorgeous', 'sets', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'so', 'are', 'actors', 'may', 'say', 'got', 'appearance', 'substance', 'seriously', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'said', 'same', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'are', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'stories', 'high-amped', 'visuals.The', 'movie', 'rather', 'faithful', 'theater', 'version', 'wonderful', 'way', 'make', 'up', 'not', 'seeing', 'Phantom', 'stage']",N/A

890007,A2HU94KJ4SUFR0,B0007TKNI8,"Garrett Stiger ""Gar""","[4, 4]","Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" tells the story of a deformed musical prodigy known as the Phantom (Gerard Butler) and his haunting obsession with a young, talented ing&eacute;nue named Christine (Emmy Rossum). When the Phantom's love fantasy is threatened by Christine's childhood sweetheart (Patrick Wilson), he takes action against the opera house for which Christine performs.For many years, I have been an intense admirer of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production of ""The Phantom of the Opera"".  I have seen the show several times, so I was quite excited when I discovered that a film adaptation was in the works.  However, my joy gave way to dread when I learned that the heavy-handed and insipid Joel Schumacher - the filmmaker responsible for the abominable ""Batman & Robin"" - was to take charge of Andrew Lloyd Webber's cinematic opus. As the release date for ""Phantom"" neared, my anxiety was understandably heightened.  Photographs, video clips, and sound bytes hinted at a truly splendid visual and auditory experience. Pre-release critical reception was lackluster to say the least, however, and so I waited with bated breath...Having finally seen Joel Schumacher's interpretation of Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"", I can safely say that the adaptation will not disappoint fans of the musical, yet it may not wholly enthrall them nor sway those indifferent toward Webber's musical compositions. Schumacher's efforts are adequate as he remains stoutly faithful to the stage production. What minor creative liberties he allows, such as a brief glimpse into the Phantom's troubled past and an exceedingly poignant epilogue, are a welcome addition to the mythic story.However, Schumacher's stringent adherence to Webber's original storyline is one of the film's weak points. Music is justifiably a constant presence in the piece, but many lines sung on stage do not work on the silver screen. Schumacher preserves many such musical phrases, and the effect is occasionally rather silly. Additionally, his direction is both generic and without energy. As a result, the film's middle passages tend to drag. Schumacher's lack of innovation and dynamism prevent his ""Phantom"" from reaching the lofty heights of recent movie musicals like ""Moulin Rouge!"" and ""Chicago.""The lead roles of Christine and her disturbed Phantom require a great deal of emotional power and musical know-how. I am pleased to report that Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler fill the requirements of their respective roles nicely. Rossum infuses Christine with such soulfulness and innocence that it is impossible not to be swept up by her grace. She also boasts a stellar singing voice. Gerard Butler, while not nearly as musically proficient as the famed Michael Crawford who originated the role of the Phantom on Broadway, makes up for any musical inadequacies with a dynamic, raw, and volatile screen presence. He offers a refreshing interpretation of the character, instilling the Phantom with a greater sense of masculinity and menace than has been seen on the stage. The rest of the cast members range from serviceable (Patrick Wilson as Christine's childhood sweetheart) to exceptional (Miranda Richardson as the mysterious Madame Giry).The technical attributes of ""The Phantom"" are, for the most part, excellent. John Mathieson's exquisite cinematography illuminates the film with such wondrous beauty and passion. A substantial amount of money was spent on recreating Paris Opera House of yesteryear, and every dollar is evident on screen. The sets are both vast and intricate, while the costumes are dazzling and extravagant. Editor Terry Rawlings does falter as much of the film is assembled in a somewhat incoherent fashion. He often cuts from close-up to close-up, offering little establishment of the characters' spatial relationships. The effect is one of disorientation and disjointedness.Schumacher has delivered a solid adaptation of Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"", no more and no less. I enjoyed the film and that in itself is a relief given Schumacher's abysmal track record. After having seen it, however, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed that Webber's illustrious and soaring musical was not given to a more gifted director. The actors and technicians do their part, imparting both passion and romance into the production. Schumacher's efforts are sufficient, but the material is deserving of so much more. What an experience this would have been had it been helmed by renowned theater director and filmmaker, Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"", ""Road to Perdition"") or the gothic eccentric Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Batman"")! ""The Phantom of the Opera"", a good film, could have been great had it been placed in more capable hands.",4,Let the dream begin?,1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,4767,"['Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber',

The central conceit surrounding his looks are clever, but also something of a distraction until the denouement. My eyes also watered during the cemetary scene, albeit for different reasons. Although perishingly cold, young actress Emmy Rossum did not appear bothered by the chill winds and falling snow, despite exposing her cleavege to the elements for a good ten minutes. What an amazing set. Stage set, I mean. Her performance has been criticised for a certain blandness but this sort of blandness in cold climates should be encouraged. In fact, the box office would be advised to hand out free oxygen masks and cylinders to any male who looks over sixty five. Not that Ms Rossum shows any greater propensity to decorum while indoors where she exposes her full range to her lover. And what a great vocal range it is too, although I'm no expert.The problem with this musical is that it only has the one song, beautifully sung on the opera roof, and worth the price of admission alone. The rest are mere tadpoles flapping around this moving number, although very pleasant.The story works because we all understand unrequieted love. Well, everyone except Andrew Lloyd Webber whose devastating handsomeness and success with women such as Sarah Brightman, must preclude such sentiments. It has been said of 'Moby Dick', that the whale is Melville. Likewise here, the phantom is almost certainly Webber. I suspect he has created this grand opus not as a tribute to the beauteous Brightman, but as a huge 'what if?' scenario. Indeed, what if he had not been born devastatingly handsome and irresistable to women, and had in fact been a grotesque shunned by polite society? I'm sure he enjoyed his little frisson, although for us mere mortals, the unrequieted love angle holds the most resonance. I only detonate the word 'resonance' twice a year in a built up area, and seeing as it's nearly Christmas, chocks away. Anyway, there are certainly no cracked mirrors in the Webber household.*SPOILERS*The only thing that left a bad taste in my mouth as I left the theatre is the law and order issue. Basically, the phantom is a serial killer, isn't he? Admittedly, not a very good one as he devises deadly traps that have their own escape switch, but nevertheless, he managed to chalk up a fair body count. He should have done a little time, if only to keep the prosecutor happy, rather than exit stage left. I'm sure there was plenty of forensic evidence to be found in his grotty grotto.

I've always wanted to see Phantom of the Opera in some for or other. He's always appeared to me to be classic horror figure, like Dracula. Missed the musical, so I caught the film on DVD. I was very disappointed.Don't get me wrong. The music was nice enough, and the sets, though the whole ""looking back forty years after it had happened"" got in the way a bit. What really, really annoyed me though was the Phantom himself. He expects to be paid by the owners of the theatre, and to get nice seating for the works that play there. It's not like he once owned the theatre or anything, he just wants money.  He chooses a girl from her childhood to teach music, then wants to spoil any chance her childhood sweetheart Raoul has with her because he's going to marry her. He's a bit old for her! And the way he woos her, through trickery, lies and killing innocent people who get in his way! He's all too particular about music and how it should be performed, yet as far as I can tell has never been in an opera himself (not until near the end anyway). This all could have worked, but the way the Phantom does these things is just so ruthless, cold and spiteful, even in his romance. He comes off more like a bratty little music snob than a romantic anti-hero. I didn't feel captivated or feel sympathy for him at all. During the swordfight between the Phantom and Raoul in the cemetary, I was hoping that Raoul would kill him, actually, I was that fed up with the Phantom.

890013,A2CN3U4JCMSMA,B0007TKNI8,George Khelashvili,"[5, 5]","Finally there exists the movie version of Andrew Lloyd Weber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"". I saw the movie twice already, it is amazing. OK, singers are not exactly Sarah Brightman and Michael Crowford caliber but they are still very, very, very good and perfectly suitable for their roles. I want to emphasize on Emmy Rossum, who portrays beautiful Christine. She is an ideal, perfect match for Christine. She is dazlling!!! And she is only 17 years old. I read on the official web site of the movie that she trained her voice in her childhood at the Metropoliten Opera. At only 17 she has gorgeous voice. I guess, if she wanted, she could've succeeded as singer rather than actress. But she looks so beatifull and she is very good actress. So she is doing the right thing staying in the movie business. It would be incorrect to compare her with Sarah Brightman. I love Sarah Brightman, she is accomplished, amazing singer. But Emmy Rossum has the advantage of being young and she has the youth in her voice, which is absolutely perfect for the role of Christine. With this movie Emmy Rossum made the character of Christine immortal.Phantom and Raul are also impressive. Raul's singing is powerfull. He blends acting and singing very well. Phantom's acting is very real, and not only them, everybody's acting, all the supporting cast is brilliant. Minnie Driver, portraying Carlotte Giudicelli, is great, her acting is so funny and real and singing is very impressive.And how about this timeless music. You never get tired of listening to it. My favorite moment in the movie is defenitely ""Point of no return"". It is magical. Phantom and Christine are just unbelievable. Directing is superb. A. L. Webber himself took part in directing and so you can see. This is the kind of movie that comes maybe ones in 20 years. The last time I saw the movie that splendid and magnificent was Franco Zeffirelli's ""Traviata"". I just do not agree with all the negative reviews this movie gets. It is rediculous to compare the movie with the theatrical version. First of all, in order to appreciate show in theater you have to be very close to stage. Otherwise none of the special effects are that great, you can not see the performers clearly. I saw Phantom in the theater, and my sit was far away from the stage and guess what, I found that performance OK. However, in movie everybody gets the chance to see everything, all the facial expressions, and plus on the movie screen, obviously you can improvise more with the camera. The Phantom of the Opera is the treasure of cinematography and musical. It is defenitely in my top three movies I've ever seen.So, this movie is defenitely must see, must have (when it comes out on DVD). Although I saw the movie twice, I am dying to see it again. I might go and watch it again. If Hollywood does not give this movie an Oscar for the best movie of the 2004, it will be absolutely shocking and rediculous. It is not only the best movie of 2004, but it belongs at least to top 10 best movies in the history of cinematography.",5,The best movie probably you will ever see,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,3055,"['Finally', 'movie', 'version', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Weber', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'saw', 'movie', 'twice', 'already', 'amazing', 'OK', 'singers', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Michael', 'Crowford', 'caliber', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'perfectly', 'suitable', 'roles', 'want', 'emphasize', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'who', 'beautiful', 'Christine', 'ideal', 'perfect', 'match', 'Christine', 'dazlling', 'only', '17', 'years', 'old', 'read', 'official', 'web', 'site', 'movie', 'trained', 'voice', 'childhood', 'Metropoliten', 'Opera', 'only', '17', 'gorgeous', 'voice', 'guess', 'wanted', 'could', ""'ve"", 'succeeded', 'singer', 'rather', 'actress', 'so', 'beatifull', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'staying', 'movie', 'business', 'would', 'be', 'incorrect', 'compare', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'love', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'accomplished', 'amazing', 'singer', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'advantage', 'being', 'young', 'youth', 'voice', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'role', 'Christine', 'movie', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'made', 'character', 'Christine', 'immortal.Phantom', 'Raul', 'are', 'also', 'impressive', 'Raul', 'singing', 'powerfull', 'acting', 'singing', 'very', 'well', 'Phantom', 'acting', 'very', 'real', 'not', 'only', 'everybody', 'acting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'portraying', 'Carlotte', 'Giudicelli', 'great', 'acting', 'so', 'funny', 'real', 'singing', 'very', 'impressive.And', 'how', 'timeless', 'music', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'listening', 'My', 'favorite', 'moment', 'movie', 'defenitely', 'Point', 'return', 'magical', 'Phantom', 'Christine', 'are', 'just', 'unbelievable', 'Directing', 'superb', 'A.', 'L.', 'Webber', 'took', 'part', 'directing', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'kind', 'movie', 'maybe', 'ones', '20', 'years', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'splendid', 'magnificent', 'was', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'Traviata', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie', 'rediculous', 'compare', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'version', 'First', 'order', 'appreciate', 'show', 'theater', 'have', 'be', 'very', 'close', 'stage', 'Otherwise', 'none', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'performers', 'clearly', 'saw', 'Phantom', 'theater', 'sit', 'was', 'far', 'away', 'stage', 'guess', 'what', 'found', 'performance', 'OK', 'However', 'movie', 'everybody', 'chance', 'see', 'everything', 'facial', 'expressions', 'movie', 'screen', 'obviously', 'can', 'improvise', 'more', 'camera', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'treasure', 'cinematography', 'musical', 'defenitely', 'top', 'three', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.So', 'movie', 'defenitely', 'must', 'see', 'must', 'have', 'when', 'out', 'DVD', 'saw', 'movie', 'twice', 'am', 'dying', 'see', 'again', 'might', 'go', 'watch', 'again', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'give', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'best', 'movie', '2004', 'will', 'be', 'absolutely', 'shocking', 'rediculous', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'movie', '2004', 'least', 'top', '10', 'best', 'movies', 'history', 'cinematography']",N/A

His performance here as the Phantom is an amazingly devoted and humble piece of work, as the character is stripped of his protective theatrical persona and revealed as a sorrowful loner at the end.  Butler didn't have to go for that depth in the performance, but he did, and it's an amazingly deep, detailed act.  Every gesture, every movement contributes to the portrayal; it's stunning.It's also overlooked.The filmmakers could have expanded upon the famous broadway show and given us some backstory to help us clear up the mysteries of the other characters, but they didn't. Why does Christine thnk the Phantom is her father? How, exactly, does the phantom conduct those music lessons? How old IS Raoul, and what was a boy his age doing hanging around a girl Christine's age when she was little---he had to have been an adolescent.  Who is Raoul, and what's going on there?  Waht about the war that's going on at the time?  The phantom builds up their lair under the opera---exactly how, anyway?The movie itself is visually gorgeous and if you don't take it seriously it's very enjoyable.  Minnie Driver gives a wonderfully gawdy performance as Carlotta and Simon Callow Ciaran Hinds mug it up as the managers.  The quiet standout was Msr. Reyer, the conductor, who has as few lines as the Phantom but manages to give a wonderful little performance as a musically-inclined mouse in a maestro's suit.The probelm with viewing this as camp is that Butler's performance is entirely sincere and honest, and every time you find yourself sneering at the gaudiness of it, his acting is enough to pull you up short.Patrick Wilson and Emmy Rossum play Raoul and Christine, and they were evidenlty hired for their singing. Both have fine voices, Wilson particularly so, but to be fair neither part offers much.  However, neither much tries, either.What a pity they didn't try and make something more of this than they did.",3,A missed opportunity and a great performance,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,2058,"['Gerard', 'Butler', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'actor', 'appearance', 'changes', 'so', 'much', 'role', 'role', 'character', 'mind', 'performance', 'here', 'Phantom', 'amazingly', 'devoted', 'humble', 'piece', 'work', 'character', 'stripped', 'protective', 'theatrical', 'persona', 'revealed', 'sorrowful', 'loner', 'end', 'Butler', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'depth', 'performance', 'did', 'amazingly', 'deep', 'detailed', 'act', 'gesture', 'movement', 'portrayal', 'stunning.It', 'also', 'overlooked.The', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'have', 'expanded', 'famous', 'broadway', 'show', 'given', 'backstory', 'help', 'clear', 'up', 'mysteries', 'other', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'Why', 'Christine', 'thnk', 'Phantom', 'father', 'How', 'exactly', 'phantom', 'conduct', 'music', 'lessons', 'How', 'old', 'IS', 'Raoul', 'was', 'boy', 'age', 'doing', 'hanging', 'girl', 'Christine', 'age', 'when', 'was', 'little', '-he', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'adolescent', 'Who', 'Raoul', 'what', 'going', 'Waht', 'war', 'going', 'time', 'phantom', 'up', 'lair', 'opera', '-exactly', 'how', 'anyway', 'movie', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'wonderfully', 'gawdy', 'performance', 'Carlotta', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'mug', 'up', 'managers', 'quiet', 'standout', 'was', 'Msr', 'Reyer', 'conductor', 'who', 'few', 'lines', 'Phantom', 'give', 'wonderful', 'little', 'performance', 'musically-inclined', 'mouse', 'maestro', 'suit.The', 'probelm', 'viewing', 'camp', 'Butler', 'performance', 'entirely', 'sincere', 'honest', 'time', 'find', 'sneering', 'gaudiness', 'acting', 'enough', 'pull', 'up', 'short.Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'play', 'Raoul', 'Christine', 'were', 'evidenlty', 'hired', 'singing', 'have', 'fine', 'voices', 'Wilson', 'particularly', 'so', 'be', 'fair', 'part', 'much', 'However', 'neither', 'much', 'tries', 'pity', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'make', 'something', 'more', 'did']",N/A

890023,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007TKNI8,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is certainly one of the most lavishly beautiful two and a half hours of film to come along in a while.  The constructed sets of the French Opera House Populaire from the exterior, the backstage, the auditorium (with of course the infamous chandelier!), and the subterranean grotto which serves as the home of the phantom are sumptuous for the eye:  they were all built with meticulous care inside the studios in England from Anthony Pratt's designs.  So, too, is the cemetery where much of the action takes place - all mists, tombs, statuary, snow, mysterious lighting, again with kudos to Anthony Pratt. The costumes designed by Alexandra Byrne are elegant and time appropriate and the large cast wears them with aplomb.  And if the film stopped here (and for many it does) this would be a sensational movie.The problem with this extravagantly gorgeous decor is that it is left with little substance to bear up under the surface majesty.  First, the ever popular Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is a bit of fluff meant for the stage, a work with superficial characters all of whom must bow to the real star of the piece - the Chandelier and its descent.  There are a few songs that are lovely, but those few notes are stretched over repetitions that try in vain to be transformed into fresh works.  The story itself is handed down from an old book by Gaston Leroux that has, like Dracula and Frankenstein,  for some reason continued to fascinate audiences in many incarnations. As a work for the stage PHANTOM has been satisfying audiences for years.  Joel Schumacher and Webber have now given us a cinematic treatment that for all its visual splendor is an empty, pompous, threadbare tale.The cast is certainly adequate, given the material.  Emmy Rossum as Christine is lovely to watch, has enormous screen presence, and a serviceable though thin soprano voice.  Likewise for the Raoul of Patrick Wilson and the Phantom of Gerard Butler.  One wonders why Schumacher insisted on actors who could sing their roles and then present them on screen with some of the weakest lip-synching on celluloid: they deserve better.  The one exception to Schumacher's rule is the Carlotta of Minnie Driver who does not sing her own role but DOES lip synch better than the rest.  Miranda Richardson as Madame Ciry is the most solid and credible actor in the cast, a group that includes the talents of Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds, Jennifer Ellison, among others.The cinematography by John Mathieson is splendid and despite the comments above the direction by Joel Schumacher does move this hollow vehicle around in a way that makes the story more convincing than did the stage version. His use of black and white imagery in the flashback scenes is splendid and suggests old etchings becoming animated. But in the end (and the end is a long time in coming) this PHANTOM lacks the substance that the Faberge trappings suggest.  Go for the decor and costumes alone and you'll not be disappointed.

890027,APASOUCF2UD42,B0007TKNI8,Greg Curtis,"[7, 9]","The long-awaited film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's smash stage hit, The Phantom of the Opera, is everything fans will expect and more.The story takes place in 1870, as the company of the Paris Opera House is plagued by mysterious happenings said to be caused by a ghost. Rising star Christine Daae is caught in a love triangle, torn between her romantic childhood crush, the dashing Raoul de Chagny, and her tutor of many years, the reclusive ""Angel of Music"". But the latter turns out to be the Phantom, whose desperate need to be loved descends into insanity as he first stalks, then kidnaps, his muse.The screenplay has been modified to include additional dialogue, expanded roles for both Raoul and Madame Giry (it's clear she knows more than she is letting on), and the infamous collapse of the chandelier occurs much later in the story. Further, flashbacks (including scenes when the principal characters were children) explain some of the questions that only readers of Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel knew the answers to.Any cinematic treatment of a live show should try to outdo its progenitor, and director Joel Schumacher has successfully met the challenge. Every frame is filled with movement and colour which, thankfully, do not suffer from the pervading darkness of Evita. Dream-like sequences accentuate the melancholy mood, and the highly-detailed costumes and sets are exquisite.The cast of largely unfamiliar faces is headed by Emmy Rossum as Christine. She gives the role a luminous vitality, and has a wonderful octave range; every moment she appears on screen is enchanting. Patrick Wilson is quite impressive as Raoul and is poised for leading-man status. But the true star is Minnie Driver, whose interpretation of the self-centred Diva, Carlotta, is worthy of an Oscar.Sadly, the lavish production is wasted on the effort of Gerard Butler who, in the title role, is the film's only disappointment. Although his passion for and understanding of the Phantom's sorrow is evident, he seems to have been cast more for his sex appeal than musical talent. His singing lacks power and is better suited to hard rock than opera; dressed in black and white and with an open shirt, he resembles a member of 70's band KISS. As a result, the Phantom is merely the boy from the wrong side of the tracks, as opposed to a tortured composer and svengali. (And when his disfigurement is finally revealed, it is -- oddly -- barely gruesome, looking like nothing more than eczema.)The biggest mystery in The Phantom of the Opera, then, is not on screen, but why Lloyd Webber is so fond of Butler. Still, it is the best adaptation of a musical in decades. The uninitiated who never saw the original show may find the film somewhat trite, but the tragic tale will put a tear in your eye.

With a good cast including Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Minnie Driver it is very well-done.The one major criticism I have is that Mr. Butler's operatic voice is barely serviceable, and hardly up to the Michael Crawford standard.  This is especially noticeable in the classic title song.  Emmy Rossum fares much better as Christine, the Phantom's obsession.  Delays cost the musical's original cast from doing this movie and are no doubt partially responsible for the movie's being a pale, though still game companion to Broadway stagings even without the original cast.  Ms. Rossum's soprano is true and vibrant.  Minnie Driver is a scene stealer as Carlotta, the Paris Opera House diva.This is still a very nice film representation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical.",4,"Extremely good film of the Webber musical, but Gerard Butler pales in comparison to Michael Crawford",1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,890,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWThis', '2004', 'film', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'musical', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'extremely', 'solid', 'good', 'cast', 'including', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'very', 'well-done.The', 'one', 'major', 'criticism', 'have', 'Mr.', 'Butler', 'operatic', 'voice', 'barely', 'serviceable', 'hardly', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'standard', 'especially', 'noticeable', 'classic', 'title', 'song', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'much', 'better', 'Christine', 'Phantom', 'obsession', 'cost', 'musical', 'original', 'cast', 'doing', 'movie', 'are', 'doubt', 'partially', 'responsible', 'movie', 'being', 'pale', 'still', 'game', 'companion', 'Broadway', 'stagings', 'even', 'original', 'cast', 'Ms.', 'Rossum', 'soprano', 'true', 'vibrant', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Carlotta', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'House', 'diva.This', 'still', 'very', 'nice', 'film', 'representation', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'stage', 'musical']",N/A

However, this movie had to deal with a lot of doubting critics like most plays turned into movies. Because in the past 35 years, there have only been 3 successful box-office musicals, and that was Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita and Chicago. I think Phantom Of The Opera is really good, remains loyal and with the help of stunning direction by Joel Schumacher it is made a classic movie. I think it surpasses Evita. And it also marks Andrew Lloyd Webber's 3rd musical adaption which also includes Evita and of course the classic Jesus Christ Superstar. I think Phantom Of The Opera can join them both as a movie classic, anyone who likes the play will love this movie. I was impressed by Emmy Rossom's performance, 16 years old during filming and she steals the show with her magnificent voice. Gerard Butler plays a wonderful Phantom and does well on bringing that character to life. Patrick Wilson can't be left out, his wonderful voice also makes his character worth watching in the film.

890032,A1U6R9WN7DJZFX,B0007TKNI8,haan,"[0, 0]","One of the best things about this movie is the opportunities the director had for costumes, sets, and special effects and the extent to which he used them.The opening scene with the effects of the chandelier and all the dust coming off the seats and boxes draws you right into the story and the transition during THINK OF ME is seamless and the going through the mirror is extremely well done, too.With the costuming, it seemed to me that when Christine ripped off the Phantom's mask, his face was disfigured in more areas than the mask covered.And I thought that Christine showed a little too much cleavage.Gerald Butler and Patrick Swift do excellent jobs with their characters, Patrick Swift's impression of Raoul was very close to that in the book.I was unable to see the director's thinking with Minnie Driver's performance as Carlotta; she switches between a strong French accent and a strong Italian accent and the result isn't laughable, but almost completely un-understandable.I felt that the worst performance came from Emily Rossum, as Christine. I understand that during most of the show, Christine is in a trance, but Emily Rossum's acting skills are, well, non-existent. She manages to spend the show looking bland and indifferent, from the parts where she's SUPPOSED to grive for her father, be terrified about the fate of her fianc? at the hands of the Phantom, to joy.I do like this movie a lot, but Schamucher could have made some better decisions.Also, I don't reccomend this film for anyone under the age of 12 or 13 due to some fairly graphic images that appear only briefly throughout the movie.",5,Schamucher Makes the Most of His Movie,1145404800,"04 19, 2006",2006,1617,"['One', 'best', 'things', 'movie', 'opportunities', 'director', 'had', 'costumes', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'extent', 'used', 'them.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'effects', 'chandelier', 'dust', 'coming', 'off', 'seats', 'boxes', 'draws', 'right', 'story', 'transition', 'THINK', 'ME', 'seamless', 'going', 'mirror', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'costuming', 'seemed', 'when', 'Christine', 'ripped', 'off', 'Phantom', 'mask', 'face', 'was', 'disfigured', 'more', 'areas', 'mask', 'covered.And', 'thought', 'Christine', 'showed', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'cleavage.Gerald', 'Butler', 'Patrick', 'Swift', 'do', 'excellent', 'jobs', 'characters', 'Patrick', 'Swift', 'impression', 'Raoul', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'book.I', 'was', 'unable', 'see', 'director', 'thinking', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'performance', 'Carlotta', 'strong', 'French', 'accent', 'strong', 'Italian', 'accent', 'result', ""n't"", 'laughable', 'almost', 'completely', 'un-understandable.I', 'felt', 'worst', 'performance', 'came', 'Emily', 'Rossum', 'Christine', 'understand', 'most', 'show', 'Christine', 'trance', 'Emily', 'Rossum', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'well', 'non-existent', 'spend', 'show', 'looking', 'bland', 'indifferent', 'parts', 'where', 'SUPPOSED', 'grive', 'father', 'be', 'terrified', 'fate', 'fianc', 'hands', 'Phantom', 'joy.I', 'do', 'movie', 'lot', 'Schamucher', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'decisions.Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'reccomend', 'film', 'anyone', 'age', '12', '13', 'due', 'fairly', 'graphic', 'images', 'appear', 'only', 'briefly', 'movie']",N/A

890034,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B0007TKNI8,HAMLET,"[1, 4]","This big screen version of the novel by Gaston Leroux and the stage musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber is excellent. It inspired the classic 1925 silent version starring Lon Chaney (aka ""The Man Of A Thousand Faces"") as The Phantom. Andrew Lloyd Webber also produced and wrote the screenplay for the film (aside from writing a new song for the film, which is also the only original song, ""Learn To Be Lonely,"" sung at over the end credits of the movie by Minnie Driver, whose vocals in the movie were dubbed by an actual opera diva, so I believe this was Mr. Webber's way of making it up to her). This movie also stars Gerard Butler (the made-for-TV movie ""Attila"", ""Tomb Raider 2: The Cradle Of Life"") in the title role of The Phantom, a horribly disfigured, murderous recluse who haunts the Paris Opera House and is enchanted by Christine, a beautiful, young singer; demanding in and of itself, no easy task. The brilliant Emmy Rossum (Sean Penn's ill-fated daughter in ""Mystic River"" and Jake Gyllenhaal's love interest in ""The Day After Tomorrow"") also stars as Christine Daae, the object of the Phantom's affections. Patrick Wilson (""Angels In America"") plays Vicomte Raoul De Chagny, Christine's child-hood friend and the Phantom's rival for Christine. Miranda Richardson (the villainous Queen Mab in ""Merlin"") co-stars as Madame Giry, the only one who knows the score between the Phantom and Christine. Minnie Driver (Robbie Coltrane's girlfriend in ""Goldeneye"", the voice of Jane in Disney's ""Tarzan"", etc.) has a minor role as Carlotta, the stuck-up diva caught in the cross-fire. The lovely Jennifer Ellison provides excellent support as Meg, Madame Giry's daughter and Christine's confidante. All the actors in the film were magnificent, especially the excellent Mr. Butler, who really carries the film, conveying everything from menace to tenderness and the scintilatingly pretty Ms. Rossum, who sings very well; she joined the Metropolitan Opera at the age of 7. Joel Shumacher (""Batman And Robin"", ""Veronica Guerin"") does a wonderful job directing this film, as he was Mr. Webber's first and only choice to direct this film. All of the songs are so good, it would be hard to pick the best one, but the most familiar one is ""Music Of The Night,"" sung by The Phantom. This film is definitely worth multiple viewings at the multi-plex and is assured classic musical film status. I nearly cried during this movie and I left the theater (Muvico 18 at I-95 & Stirling Road) humming some of the tunes, especially the tender love song ""All I Ask Of You."" The soundtrack (see my review on it) is everything I expected...and more. As good as the film itself. The film left some minor plot points unclear, however. Not that it's a bad thing, but ""Is a wee bit of closure too much to ask?"" Maybe Andrew Lloyd Webber did that so that we either read the novel by Gaston Leroux, see the musical or draw our own conclusions as to the missing information in the movie. It's one of the greatest movies that I've ever seen. Love it.If Mel Gibson's controversial, but successful epic drama, ""The Passion Of The Christ"" doesn't get nominated for any Academy Awards (as I think will be the case), ""The Phantom Of The Opera"" should be nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song or (at least) Best Costume Design. I nearly cried when I saw this film. The ""Brief Violent Images"" weren't intense enough to warrant a PG-13 rating. The film should've been rated PG for momentary nudity (for those considering bringing children to this movie, or for those who are too prudish and can't handle it; it's not a woman baring her breasts, anyway, then I would understand the PG-13 or R rating) and brief frightening images. I recommend that you read the novel first (which I haven't read), see the 1925 silent film version and see the stage musical (which I haven't seen) before seeing this movie, which is faithful to the book and stage play. The author and Andrew Lloyd Webber wouldn't have been credited if the movie hadn't been faithful to the original novel by Leroux and the stage musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. I recommend this film entirely to anyone who likes musicals (""The Sound Of Music"", ""My Fair Lady"", ""West Side Story"", ""The King And I"", ""Chicago"", etc). Should be right up there with these timeless films. So, if you like music, comedy (which is outbalanced here; not that it's a bad thing, it was necessary) and drama (or just one of the three) and you want to see them all rolled into one, then this is the movie for you.The DVD is LOADED with ""Phantom"" extras: the original theatrical trailer (on Disc 1) and on Disc 2, an hour-long ""Behind The Mask: The History Of The Phantom Of The Opera,"" (with Andrew Lloyd Webber, Hal Prince and others) which is an absolute MUST for theater and movie fans, a 45-minute featurette on the making of the film (with director Joel Schumacher, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler, Patrick Wilson and other members of the cast and crew) and a deleted scene: ""No One Would Listen,"" which is great, but, as there's no commentary as to why the scene was cut and it leaves the curiosity that you have over the reason that the scene was cut open; look it up in the editorial reviews for this film, but it's showing up on DVD is absolutely fine.Rated PG for brief frightening images.",5,"One Of The Greatest Musicals Of All Time!!

890037,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B0007TKNI8,Hazen B Markoe,"[867, 925]","Many people will look at this film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's classic musical spectacular, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA with mixed emotions.  There are people who will be upset that Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, who played the original Christine and Phantom respectively, were not allowed to recreate their signature roles. There will also be people who'll be disappointed that this version is not a literal translation of the stage musical.  Finally, we have the critics of both Webber and director Joel Schumacher, who have both been accused of wretched excess in previous projects in their individual careers.  Taken as a film version however, this PHANTOM stands the test of time, not only as a wonderful musical film, but as one of the more faithful versions of Gaston Laroux's romance/horror novel.Starting with a black and white prologue, the film tells the story of budding opera star Christine Daae and the two men who fight for her heart: the noble Viscount who she knew in childhood, and the mysterious Phantom of the Paris Opera House who hides his ugliness behind a half-mask while sponsoring Christine's career.  Like the stage production, this film is awash in glorious colors and sets that would put many epics to shame. It's well balanced by solid performances that help propel the romantic, if melodramatic, story along.Gerard Butler makes for a wonderfully dark and obsessive Phantom, while allowing the character to retain the audience's sympathy. Miranda Richardson is solid as the dour Madame Giry, who knows the Phantom's secret.  Minnie Driver easily gets the most laughs as the over-bearing diva, Carlotta.  (It's interesting to note that Ms. Driver's singing is dubbed in the film proper, while she actually sings the new closing credits melody ""Learn to be Lonely."") Patrick Wilson makes for a stalwart, if somewhat bland, Viscount.  But the strongest impression is made by the lovely Emmy Rossum.  Only in her late teens when filming, she turns in a fantastic performance with a crystal clear voice that does justice to Webber's score. Joel Schumacher does a strong enough job in directing this film, allowing the music and the screenplay that he co-wrote with Webber to shine.In the end, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a delightful spectacle that does justice in its own way to both the stage original and Laroux's book.

Having read Gaston Leroux's version, and not seeing the stage version, I was expecting a horror story. When I realized it was actually a romance I was hesitant to watch it because I am not a fan of romance movies, but as soon as the overture began playing I was complelely sucked in. The music was unlike anything I had ever heard before and I fell in love with it. I also did not recognize any of the actors except for Miranda Richarson and Minnie Driver. I also knew who Gerard Butler was from Tomb Raider but did not recognize him at all. I thought the three main actors (Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson) were singers they picked off Broadway or the Opera. Their performances were breathtaking. This is the only movie that I can watch a hundred times and cry everytime. Gerard Butler breaks my heart as the Phantom. Emmy Rossum was amazing and incredibly beautiful as Christine. Patrick Wilson was a perfect Raoul. I was a little disapointed that he did not have as much screen time as I was expecting, because in Leroux's version the story follows Raoul through the story. In Andrew Lloyd Webber's version the story seems to follow Christine. I think Raoul could have been included in a little more of the story, but I still give the movie the highest rating I can give. Altogether, even though the movie is quite a bit different from the book, it will still remain one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie is one of those films that sucks you right into the story, and you start to feel for the characters, especially the Phantom, as though they were real people. You will fall in love right alongside Christine and Raoul and your heart will break right along with the Phantom's. It is an experience you will never forget and one you will want to have again.

It all ends rather corny, over the top and overlong.

Trigg ""howietUK""","[13, 61]","NOTE; I HAVE SEEN THE FILM, MANY REVIEWERS BELOW HAVEN'T???Now, I should start this review by stating that I have NOT seen the stage version, however I am a fan of the original stage soundtrack (Sarah Brightman & Michael Crawford). I am reviewing the film based purely on what I saw and heard, without comparisokn.It would also appear this is a love or hate film, as many of the reviewers here loved the film. Anyway...My first criticism is that whilst the film looked lavish, it actually looked more like a stage set than 'real life', some of the backdrops looked like exactly that,(especially the outdoor scenes) and I found it off putting at times. I also found that the black & white scenes looked cheap, almost tv movie quality. (Present is filmed in B&W;, past in colour).As for the performances, well Emmy Rossum was passable as Christine, though her vocals are a far cry from Ms Brightmans. Gerard Butler as the Phantom, is a disappointment.  His singing is below par, and almost has a speech impediment(?) and seems to have no control over volume.  Throughout the film, he is quite an attractive Phantom, but when he is unveiled, he becomes hideous, even his hair changing colour and texture, and scars appear where the mask didn't even cover.  Ridiculous, viewers are far more discerning these days, we expect more care and attention to detail.Patrick Wilson as Raoul is fine, and Miranda Richardson is underused as Madame Giry (Christines 'mother') - it should be noted she is the only one to attempt a French accent! Hello, the film is set in Paris with just 1 French person!  So Hollywood it's ridiculous.  Are Americans scared of a foreign accent?The best performances for me came from Minnie Driver, who is a fine over the top Diva, and Simon Callow as one of the Opera's new managers.In summary, this film is a huge disappointment, with poor vocal performances rendering the music lacklustre and emotionless.  Definately poorly cast, and whilst I am not suggesting the originals return, the vocals should have been the most important reason to cast, not JUST a pretty face...If you want to watch a Webber musical, then get Evita on Dvd, its a far more superior film in every way, vocally, visually, lyrically, emotionally.  That is how this film SHOULD have been.This is just disappointing... :((and I meant to score this film with 2stars not 3, but I cant edit that?)",3,Tacky and disappointing,1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,2384,"['NOTE', 'HAVE', 'SEEN', 'THE', 'FILM', 'MANY', 'REVIEWERS', 'BELOW', 'HAVE', ""N'T"", 'Now', 'should', 'start', 'review', 'stating', 'have', 'NOT', 'seen', 'stage', 'version', 'however', 'am', 'fan', 'original', 'stage', 'soundtrack', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'am', 'reviewing', 'film', 'based', 'purely', 'what', 'saw', 'heard', 'comparisokn.It', 'would', 'also', 'appear', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'loved', 'film', 'Anyway', 'My', 'first', 'criticism', 'whilst', 'film', 'looked', 'lavish', 'actually', 'looked', 'more', 'stage', 'set', ""'real"", 'life', 'backdrops', 'looked', 'exactly', 'especially', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'found', 'off', 'putting', 'times', 'also', 'found', 'black', 'white', 'scenes', 'looked', 'cheap', 'almost', 'tv', 'movie', 'quality', 'Present', 'filmed', 'B', 'W', 'colour', '.As', 'performances', 'well', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'was', 'passable', 'Christine', 'vocals', 'are', 'far', 'cry', 'Ms', 'Brightmans', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'disappointment', 'singing', 'par', 'almost', 'speech', 'impediment', 'have', 'control', 'volume', 'film', 'quite', 'attractive', 'Phantom', 'when', 'unveiled', 'hideous', 'even', 'hair', 'changing', 'colour', 'texture', 'scars', 'appear', 'where', 'mask', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'cover', 'Ridiculous', 'viewers', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'discerning', 'days', 'expect', 'more', 'care', 'attention', 'detail.Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Raoul', 'fine', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'underused', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'Christines', ""'mother"", 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'only', 'one', 'attempt', 'French', 'accent', 'Hello', 'film', 'set', 'Paris', 'just', '1', 'French', 'person', 'So', 'Hollywood', 'ridiculous', 'Are', 'Americans', 'scared', 'foreign', 'accent', 'best', 'performances', 'came', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'who', 'fine', 'top', 'Diva', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'one', 'Opera', 'new', 'managers.In', 'summary', 'film', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'poor', 'vocal', 'performances', 'rendering', 'music', 'lacklustre', 'emotionless', 'Definately', 'poorly', 'cast', 'whilst', 'am', 'not', 'suggesting', 'originals', 'return', 'vocals', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'important', 'reason', 'cast', 'not', 'JUST', 'pretty', 'face', 'want', 'watch', 'Webber', 'musical', 'then', 'get', 'Evita', 'Dvd', 'far', 'more', 'superior', 'film', 'way', 'vocally', 'visually', 'lyrically', 'emotionally', 'how', 'film', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been.This', 'just', 'disappointing', 'meant', 'score', 'film', '2stars', 'not', '3', 'cant', 'edit']",N/A

I was on the edge of my seat at the end (it's been awhile since I listened to it and couldn't remember what happened).  To see it in the film version, much of the recording made sense.  It explained parts I couldn't fully comprehend from just listening. Have to check the credits to see if anyone did their own singing because at times it looked dubbed, but tolerable.  The Phantom was rather sexy and not grotesque.  The script did stick to original recording.  I believe one review said the songs were different but it was almost verbatum.  Few lines were sort of spoken rather than fully sung but it perfect.  Well done.  Now I will buy the special edition.  Better than Les Mis (I still haven't been able to sit through that entire Liam Neison version).",5,Won't disappoint Phantom fans,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,1095,"['hearing', 'several', 'reviews', 'film', 'was', 'relucant', 'watch', 'love', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'finally', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'Manhattan', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'now', 'was', 'afraid', 'movie', 'would', 'ruin', 'love', 'play', 'Not', 'chance', 'ordered', 'Demand', 'figured', 'had', 'nothing', 'lose', '4', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'end', 'been', 'awhile', 'listened', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'see', 'film', 'version', 'much', 'recording', 'made', 'sense', 'explained', 'parts', 'could', ""n't"", 'fully', 'comprehend', 'just', 'listening', 'Have', 'check', 'credits', 'see', 'anyone', 'did', 'own', 'singing', 'times', 'looked', 'dubbed', 'tolerable', 'Phantom', 'was', 'rather', 'sexy', 'not', 'grotesque', 'script', 'did', 'stick', 'original', 'recording', 'believe', 'one', 'review', 'said', 'songs', 'were', 'different', 'was', 'almost', 'verbatum', 'Few', 'lines', 'were', 'sort', 'spoken', 'rather', 'fully', 'sung', 'perfect', 'Well', 'done', 'Now', 'will', 'buy', 'special', 'edition', 'Better', 'Les', 'Mis', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'sit', 'entire', 'Liam', 'Neison', 'version']",N/A

There are the title melody and Christines song that are typical for Webber's genius, but the rest is kitsch, simply he overdid it with beeing commercial. I dont know if this is absolutely true to the original Webber musical, but I have seen an other Phantom Of The Opera movie where the storyline is much better drawn out.Here in this movie of Schumacher, the story does not unfold, right in the beginning Christine already is becoming the star, and they say she had lessions from someone unknown - but it is right after her coming out as a great singer that she meets the phantom the first time. This makes no sense! In the other movie she first met with him during a long time period and learns with him, until he finally arranges that she can replace the operas diva. In Schumachers film there are several ridiculous moments, but the big one is at the end when Phantom binds Raoul to the gate, it is so laughable, it hurts. And the opera explodes as if its a dynamit depot. The movie reveals that Phantom really came as a little boy into the opera, escaping from a circus where he was shown and mistreated for his ugly face. This means he has really no right to be in the opera and he also has absolutely no artistic background, so how did he learn singing or to teach it? - by the way he can not really sing, if his singing voice is that from Gerard Butler, Butler really is no singer. I was disappointed to learn that Phantom has really no background to be at the opera. In the other movie it was left in the dark, but it seemed that he is there because of a long family relation with the opera or even was from an owners or directors family, in any case he came with a music background.",1,Bad storyline,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,1818,"['Yes', 'visual', 'stunning', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'fantastic', 'music', 'partially', 'well', 'based', 'too', 'much', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'title', 'melody', 'Christines', 'song', 'are', 'typical', 'Webber', 'genius', 'rest', 'kitsch', 'simply', 'overdid', 'beeing', 'commercial', 'dont', 'know', 'absolutely', 'true', 'original', 'Webber', 'musical', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'movie', 'where', 'storyline', 'much', 'better', 'drawn', 'out.Here', 'movie', 'Schumacher', 'story', 'not', 'unfold', 'right', 'beginning', 'Christine', 'already', 'becoming', 'star', 'say', 'had', 'lessions', 'someone', 'unknown', 'right', 'coming', 'out', 'great', 'singer', 'phantom', 'first', 'time', 'sense', 'other', 'movie', 'first', 'met', 'long', 'time', 'period', 'learns', 'finally', 'can', 'replace', 'operas', 'diva', 'Schumachers', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'ridiculous', 'moments', 'big', 'one', 'end', 'when', 'Phantom', 'Raoul', 'gate', 'so', 'laughable', 'opera', 'dynamit', 'depot', 'movie', 'Phantom', 'really', 'came', 'little', 'boy', 'opera', 'escaping', 'circus', 'where', 'was', 'shown', 'mistreated', 'ugly', 'face', 'really', 'no', 'right', 'be', 'opera', 'also', 'absolutely', 'artistic', 'background', 'how', 'did', 'learn', 'singing', 'teach', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'sing', 'singing', 'voice', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Butler', 'really', 'singer', 'was', 'disappointed', 'learn', 'Phantom', 'really', 'background', 'be', 'opera', 'other', 'movie', 'was', 'left', 'dark', 'seemed', 'there', 'long', 'family', 'relation', 'opera', 'even', 'was', 'owners', 'directors', 'family', 'case', 'came', 'music', 'background']",N/A

But in recent times, no one has captured the imagination of fans everywhere like Andrew Lloyd Webber and his masterpiece, ""The Phantom of the Opera"". Eighteen years after opening on the West End and sixteen years after beginning on Broadway, ""Phantom"" has finally taken the world by storm as a movie. And it's still unbeatable.Of the many critics of the film, the main complaint has been with casting - mainly, that of the lead role. While Michael Crawford shone in the theater production, the choice of Gerard Butler as the movie phantom had many heads being scratched. Butler doesn't have as commanding of a voice as Crawford, yet it still works. His gravelly tone and dangerous appeal play a nice complement to the smooth tones of Patrick Wilson as Raoul, and it is this danger that lures Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) to his dark world.When some musicals make the transition to film, they remain as they were on stage, resulting in a somewhat stilted performance. The fact that ""Phantom"" doesn't follow its stage counterpart exactly is a welcome relief. The movie mainly acts as a flashback, with short interruptions to show the present-day, shot as if they were film reels of the early 20th century. This nicely breaks up parts that would not have fared so well on the screen.Overall, ""Phantom"" is a delight to watch on the screen. Butler and Wilson are brilliantly matched as foes, and Emmy Rossum shines as Christine Daae - I actually prefer her performance to that of Sarah Brightman.

890051,A2YDESWJL4P3WV,B0007TKNI8,James A. Holland,"[4, 11]","I have to say that I was left utterly inimpressed and totally uninspired by this latest version of the ""Phantom"".Let me be specific.I loved the cinematography....the producers did an absolutely splendid job with that.From beginning to end, this film is a visual master piece and much of my 3 star rating is based upon this premise.Other than this, there was really nothing too great about this film.Seeing as this is a musical, I was actually quite disappointed by the bland and downright insipid singers chosen to star in this film.First the female lead role of Christine:I admit that the young lady that was cast in the lead role had a pleasent enough voice for this sort of music, but, contrary to popular opinion, I was not overly impressed with her voice.I found her acting more involved and, frankly, better than her singing.The Phantom:This guy should restrict his singing to the local karaoke bars! From his tone, to his lack of musicality, his is easily the worst voice I've ever heard in a lead role of ANY play, musical or opera.Here again I've found the acting to be stronger than the singing...in this case the acting was exponentially more impressive as the singig was really just two steps from torrid.Again, the general populous was very taken by this guy based on his LOOKS!And that's the real problem here, they've chosen an attrative actor, who CAN NOT sing, to play the part of what is supposed to be a hiddeous phantom who CAN sing. The result being a handsome phantom with a hiddeous voice!!!! Way to go casting directors.The Vice Count:Well, here's another actor ill-chosen for the part he is to portray.For one, he looks more like a complete sissy whimp then the strong, heroic savior and lover of Christine.The guy has zero masculinity...visually nor vocally.He not only looks like a whimp, but is tenor voice is a weak and small one of no particular destinction whatsoever.Nothing like having to watch a whimpy, feminine looking guy with a small, non-descript voice cast in a part that is supposed to go to a heroic figure. That's akin to casting Johnny Depp (though a great actor) in the part of the Termintor or XXX. It just doesn't work!However; I'm not surpised as Hollywood no longer seems to be interested in manly looking actors, rather opting for boyish, weak and fem looking whimps.The rest of the cast was ok. Again, nothing stood out as particularily great.One of my biggest issues with this production is that they have altered the score and thus, removed the OPERA part from the equation.Traditionally, the operatic sequences in the ""Phantom"" are from FAUST or some other actual operatic work.Here; however, they've substituted an Opera for some fictional ""opera"", in english and all.How terribly bland and insipid the overall result.The exclusion of any real operatic sequences really hurt the overall, musical flair of the film.Overall, this film is decent and were it not for the fact that that the voices of the cast are so weak, it would have been incontrivertibly better.I've only watched this film once, as the monotony and banality of it all was such that I had no desire to watch it again.Serious musical or opera lovers beware...this is a lightweight Hollywood fare from beginning to end.",3,Not what I thought....,1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,3237,"['have', 'say', 'was', 'left', 'utterly', 'inimpressed', 'totally', 'uninspired', 'latest', 'version', 'Phantom', '.Let', 'be', 'specific.I', 'loved', 'cinematography', '.the', 'producers', 'did', 'absolutely', 'splendid', 'job', 'that.From', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'visual', 'master', 'piece', 'much', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'based', 'premise.Other', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'too', 'great', 'film.Seeing', 'musical', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'bland', 'downright', 'insipid', 'singers', 'chosen', 'star', 'female', 'lead', 'role', 'Christine', 'admit', 'young', 'lady', 'was', 'cast', 'lead', 'role', 'had', 'pleasent', 'enough', 'voice', 'sort', 'music', 'contrary', 'popular', 'opinion', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'impressed', 'voice.I', 'found', 'acting', 'more', 'involved', 'frankly', 'better', 'singing.The', 'Phantom', 'guy', 'should', 'restrict', 'singing', 'local', 'karaoke', 'bars', 'tone', 'lack', 'musicality', 'easily', 'worst', 'voice', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'lead', 'role', 'ANY', 'play', 'musical', 'opera.Here', 'again', ""'ve"", 'found', 'acting', 'be', 'stronger', 'singing', 'case', 'acting', 'was', 'exponentially', 'more', 'impressive', 'singig', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'two', 'steps', 'torrid.Again', 'general', 'populous', 'was', 'very', 'taken', 'guy', 'based', 'LOOKS', 'real', 'problem', 'here', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'attrative', 'actor', 'who', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'sing', 'play', 'part', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'hiddeous', 'phantom', 'who', 'CAN', 'sing', 'result', 'being', 'handsome', 'phantom', 'hiddeous', 'voice', 'Way', 'go', 'casting', 'directors.The', 'Vice', 'Count', 'Well', 'here', 'actor', 'ill-chosen', 'part', 'portray.For', 'one', 'more', 'complete', 'sissy', 'whimp', 'then', 'strong', 'heroic', 'savior', 'lover', 'Christine.The', 'guy', 'zero', 'masculinity', 'visually', 'vocally.He', 'not', 'only', 'whimp', 'tenor', 'voice', 'weak', 'small', 'one', 'particular', 'destinction', 'whatsoever.Nothing', 'having', 'watch', 'whimpy', 'feminine', 'looking', 'guy', 'small', 'non-descript', 'voice', 'cast', 'part', 'supposed', 'go', 'heroic', 'figure', 'akin', 'casting', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'great', 'actor', 'part', 'Termintor', 'XXX', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'surpised', 'Hollywood', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'interested', 'manly', 'looking', 'actors', 'rather', 'opting', 'boyish', 'weak', 'fem', 'looking', 'whimps.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'ok.', 'Again', 'nothing', 'stood', 'out', 'particularily', 'great.One', 'biggest', 'issues', 'production', 'have', 'altered', 'score', 'thus', 'removed', 'OPERA', 'part', 'equation.Traditionally', 'operatic', 'sequences', 'Phantom', 'are', 'FAUST', 'other', 'actual', 'operatic', 'work.Here', 'however', ""'ve"", 'substituted', 'Opera', 'fictional', 'opera', 'english', 'all.How', 'terribly', 'bland', 'insipid', 'overall', 'result.The', 'exclusion', 'real', 'operatic', 'sequences', 'really', 'hurt', 'overall', 'musical', 'flair', 'film.Overall', 'film', 'decent', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'voices', 'cast', 'are', 'so', 'weak', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'incontrivertibly', 'better.I', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'film', 'once', 'monotony', 'banality', 'was', 'such', 'had', 'desire', 'watch', 'again.Serious', 'musical', 'opera', 'lovers', 'beware', 'lightweight', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'beginning', 'end']",N/A

I am not disappointed that this film is so bad; what I find horrifying is that this drivel has so many devoted fans.  I don't know what's more frightening - that so many people consider this ""high art"" or the sad fact that so many seem to confuse it with real opera.  The very word ""opera"" in the title is an insult to the good names of Puccini and Verdi.In my youth, I had marginally enjoyed Jesus Christ Superstar, and thought that Evita was fine theatre.  But I hated Sunset Boulevard, and have no thought of ever seeing that ubiquitous tourist-trap, Cats.  After 38 years of attending Broadway, and seeing dozens of musicals, I have come to loathe the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and the score and story of the Phantom of the Opera above all.  If you are still reading, let me explain why.I believe that Mr. Webber epitomizes exactly what is wrong with modern Broadway musicals.  His music never advances beyond trite, overly sentimental commercial fluff.  The singsong structure of his formulaic melodies and their contrived, adolescent lyrics are apt to get stuck in your head for days, while almost never managing to advance the storyline or explain the character's motivations.  At best, his style is derivative; the melody line for Music of the Night sounds suspiciously to me like portions of Puccini's La Fanciulla del West, and in spots, I hear poor imitations of La Boheme.  At his worst, I get the feeling that he writes with one eye on his checkbook and both ears tuned to the latest trends in top-forty radio.  When I listen to anything Webber, my mind's ear automatically hears Celine Dion and Britney Spears, stripped of even the bare modicum of taste that their least commercial endeavors have to offer.  Not only are his lyricist's poorly structured songs devoid of wit and ingenuity, they frequently leave the action dead in the water.  Worst of all, they pander to the mentality of a nation reared on reality TV, empty pop tunes and American Idols.I saw Phantom on Broadway.  When the final curtain came down and the applause subsided, I realized with great sadness that today's Broadway audience seems content with smoke, mirrors, and special effects.  I kept marveling that so much applause could be wasted on a show built around a chandelier and bad pop songs.  The lyrics often make no sense at all, when they manage every so often to rhyme, they grab hold like there's no tomorrow, refusing to let go.  Sondheim it's not; in fact, for my money, they've got a way to go to overtake Jerry Herman, or even the long-forgotten composers of Happy Hunting.Then there are the plot holes; for lack of unlimited space, let's cover just a few.  Christine apparently has lived in the opera house since being orphaned.  I didn't know anyone had ever lived in an opera house, but why not?  If the story is to be taken seriously, one has to wonder how Christine's father came to repose in an opulent crypt, while she was forced to mature in the squalor of a dressing room, which is about all I ever really learned about her.  Anyway, Christine believes that the Phantom is an Angel of Music, despite his demonic, cryptic notes bearing sinister demands, and resorting to murderous acts of vandalism when he doesn't get his way, like a petulant child.  At one point, we learn that he was rescued as a boy from being a caged circus freak and hidden in the bowels of the opera house, where he's spent his entire existence (think The Elephant Man, without any real drama or character development).  He is described as, ""a genius, an architect, a composer and a magician"", but there is no explanation of how he came to develop these talents while spending his youth hidden in catacombs, with apparently no formal education.After the intermission - rarely have I seen a movie musical that made it plainer where Act Two began on stage - Bravo! - he shows up at a New Year's masquerade, interrupting (thank God) the most insufferable musical number in my memory.  I believe that the Phantom's entrance in the Masquerade scene was the only way Mr. Webber could write his way out of the dizzying spiral momentum and endless repetition of that God-awful melody.  Although he recently murdered one of the employees of the opera house, none of the hundreds of people present think to rush and detain him, even though it is finally obvious that he is certainly no specter.  He then presents the theatre management with a new ""opera"", which they agree to stage with little discussion.  The score, by the way, is full of utterly ridiculous ""operatic scenes"" that would ring false to even the most casual opera patron; I would expect them to be laughed off the stage of any legitimate opera house of the past three centuries.  More puzzling still is why the Phantom champions the career of Christine over the diva Carlotta, when it is clear (or should be to anyone with ears) that at least Carlotta manages a few high C's, while Christine possesses the instrument of a second-rate 20th century pop singer.  This is a story about ""opera"" professionals, and a Phantom obsessed with opera?  There were more plausible opera moments in the 1962 Hammer film, which wasn't even a musical.  And there was far more horror in the Lon Chaney classic, which managed, even in 1925, to avoid the gigantic leaps of logic required by the ludicrous narrative presented here.The biggest plot hole gnawed at me like a rat in a garbage can.  The Viscount Raoul is supposed to be in love with Christine, and she him, their bliss threatened only by the presence of the menacing Phantom.  Like the proverbial Knight in Shining Armor, we never learn ANYTHING about Raoul, except that he is from ""a powerful and wealthy family"".  If he is truly powerful and wealthy, and so very much in love, why doesn't he simply take Christine away from the opera house to escape the Phantom?  Was the rent on her dressing room paid too far in advance, one wonders?  Of course, then there would be no story.  Story?  What story?  The hundreds of fans of the show who complain how much this film has ruined their beloved ""best musical of all time"", never seem to notice that the movie script at least bothered to flesh out the plot a hundredfold over the stage production, and it STILL has almost no story, and even less logic.If you remove the special effects and gooey love songs, this celebration of everything that is wrong with Broadway today collapses under the weight of its own inadequacies.  I give the film two stars for its sumptuous costumes and lavish sets, but if this can pass as ""the best musical ever written"" as so many seem to think, God help the future of Broadway.",1,A Phantom

Unfortunately, not Phantom.  The movie just took away too much from the experience of seeing the phenomenon on stage where you actually sit in front of the performers as it happens night after night live.  The magic is lost on the screen.  However, that being said, there was some good in the movie.  The background scene in which Madame Giri tells Raoul about the young child who became the Phantom was nice.  Since the beginning, I have always felt that the casting of the title character was way off.  Why cast a young, handsome man when everyone knows that he is to be portrayed much older than Christine and be disfigured.  He is supposed to be a substitute for her dead father.  I have often wondered why Michael Crawford was not offered the role.  However, Emmy Rossum does do a fine job as Christine.  Patrick Wilson is fine as Raoul; I never liked the part...too boring.

890063,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0007TKNI8,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[8, 11]","Andrew Lloyd Webber's music has given me much pleasure over the years. I live in Manhattan, and although I don't usually go to Broadway musicals unless I hear rave reviews, I saw ""Phantom of the Opera,"" and loved it. Director Joel Schumacher's film production is simply terrific, although somewhat flawed! I admit it is a bit bombastic at times, but the music is spectacular, as are the sets, cast and acting. I don't want to compare screen versus stage versions.They are totally different mediums and each lends unique and special moments. I have heard some call the film vulgar, and I say ""Boo"" on their snobbishness!As most know, this is a bizarre beauty and the beast kind of love story. Set in 1870's Paris, a talented, mysterious genius with a terribly scarred face lives in secret beneath the opera house, haunting the building, and those who spend much time there, with his spectral presence. Frequently heard from but never seen, he composes brilliant music, writes operas, designs sets, etc.. His life of solitude and bitterness have driven him mad. Unbeknownst to any, he has been lovely, young soprano Christine Daae's mentor and voice teacher since her childhood. The young woman believes that he is her beloved deceased father's spirit and calls him her ""angel of music."" He has grown to love the innocent ingenue with the exquisite voice. When the two appear together the ambiance is shadowed and otherworldly, and Christine always seems hypnotized - which is quite credible given the Phantom's sheer force of personality. One night the Prima Donna walks out on a performance and Christine takes her place. When Raoul, a wealthy young nobleman, (Patrick Wilson), sees the extraordinary young singer, he falls in love. The Phantom does not take competition lightly.Schumacher's production is fantastically gothic, as is Gaston Leroux's novel, upon which all opera phantoms are based. Gerard Butler, as the deformed anti-hero, is the epitome of the dominant Gothic Hero. He would be superb as Mr. Rochester or Heathcliff.....but I digress. Let it suffice to say he makes a superior ""Phantom of the Opera."" Although I very much like his voice, some say it does not measure up to the rest of the casts'. Mr. Butler, however, more than makes-up for any lack of vocal power with his charisma, virility and powerful stage presence. He uses eroticism and sensuality to seduce, perfectly, especially when he brings Christine to his lair, deep in the watery depths beneath the opera house, and sings ""Music of the Night.""  ""Touch me, trust me / savour each sensation!"" And, ""Open up your mind / let your fantasies unwind / in this darkness which you know you cannot fight."" He smolders in ""Point of No Return,"" which is one very steamy number. There are times when I see Butler's Phantom as a vampire-like figure - a dark, deeply handsome, all powerful vampire - not a ghoulish one. With his slicked back dark wig, tux, sensual lips and mask, he looks a forceful figure from the underworld - (which he is) - beckoning Christine to leave the ""garish light of day,"" and come, ""Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before! / Let your soul take you where you long to be! / Only then can you belong to me."" In the scene where he spies on Christine and Raoul on the opera roof, hiding amidst the gargoyles, he picks up the rose she has dropped in the snow and holds it to his lips. Almost everything in the shot is black and white except for the red rose at his mouth...like drops of blood. That's vampire-like!! (reminiscent of Frank Langella's 1970's Dracula, not Bela Lugosi's).Eighteen year-old Emmy Rossum is absolutely luminous as Christine. The sound of her spectacular, opera-trained voice is alone worth the price of the DVD. Ms. Rossum is a talented actress, and her innocent fresh look is a perfect compliment to Butler's dark, menacing specter, and Patrick Wilson's handsome swashbuckling viscount. Wilson's romantic handsomeness and fabulous tenor voice make him an exceptional choice for the hero part. The real taut passion, however, is between Butler and Rossum. This magnetic force between them is one aspect of the movie I prefer over the play. The phantom is cast as a much older man in the stage production, and when he is unmasked one feels totally repulsed, and not very sympathetic. He becomes merely one more aging man lusting after a young woman. Also, Christine knows him so well that perhaps she doesn't see him as quite the monster the audience does. There are qualities she has been drawn to, before she saw his whole face. Her empathy is not totally destroyed by the grotesque image. The younger, handsomer version of the Phantom permits a certain believable ambivalence in her feelings, which makes for more tension in the storyline.Andrew Lloyd Weber collaborated closely with Schumacher throughout the making of the movie. The supporting cast is excellent with Miranda Richardson as Mme. Giry, Ciaran Hinds as Fermin, Simon Callow as Andre, and Minnie Driver as Carlotta, the spoiled diva. Although Ms. Driver is hilarious in her role, she spends too much time, with too many lines, onstage. The campiness works well as comic relief. However, the effect is lost with an overabundance of this and becomes kitsch.Finally, buy the 2-Disc Special, when purchasing the DVD. The second disc, approximately 45 minutes, is entitled ""Behind the Mask: The Story of The Phantom of the Opera,"" and documents the journey from Gaston Leroux's novel to the silent film, to Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage version, and finally to Joel Schumacher's feature film. Included in this documentary are interviews with the principals. There are also several wonderful clips from early performances that took place at Andrew Lloyd Webber's estate before the musical was completed. Also included is an excised scene which features Gerard Butler as the Phantom, singing his part in ""No One Would Listen.""JANA",5,A Spectacular Cinema Extravaganza With Superb Music &

While I was originally more of a fan of the actors and actresses involved in the movie and for the cinematography, I found the history of the play very interesting. The old footage of original rehearsals was a nice addition and the behind the scenes footage of the movie was good as well. I also like to know the original story behind a movie so I can see where the writers or directors made changes and why. This is one of those movies that gets better each time you watch it. Be sure to look for the easter egg on the second disk that has a cast and crew sing-a-long the ""The Phantom of the Opera"". It'll make you laugh.

OK, granted, the production values are superb - but all efforts are wasted in the hands of director Shumacher.  The viewer is not allowed to savor any scene or set piece without being disconcerted by the MTV style jump cutting.  Once or twice, the camera relaxes - as in the Cemetery scene - and we sadly experience the missed potential of the whole.Plotwise, all changes from stage to film are acceptable, with one exception: The face of The Phantom.  This charming guy could have certainly gone about society with a simple patch on his eye.  And, with his multi-talents been accepted in the finest circles in Paris at that time.  Therefore, the unmasking scene is a bust.  Also, there is nothing to indicate that he is MAD!The entire cast is fine, and under the mastery of a director like Milos Forman (think Amadeus) they would have shone brightly in a modern day classic.  Instead the audience gets a two hour-plus, pop video.  What a shame.Something is wrong with a DVD package where the extras are better than the film itself.

It is visually beautiful and full of emotion.  I have the soundtrack of the original play with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman; I also saw the play on Broadway with other actors.  Frankly, I think the movie is better.  Emmy Rossum sings like the innocent she is portraying and her voice is clear and sweet.  Patrick Wilson has a nice tenor and is believable as her young suitor, ready to conquer the world for her. (Loved the hair!!)  However, it is Gerald Butler who steals the show; he should be called the ""Man of a thousand faces"" and looks different in every movie I've seen him in.  He freely admitted in an interview that he's not a singer; in fact, he had to take a crash course in vocalizing to sing the part.  Given that bit of information, I think he did a fine job and his acting is superb. The only complaint is that it must have been hard to make him look bad, given his Scottish good looks. I was rooting for the Phantom for most of the movie, and I wouldn't mind if he wanted to lock me up in his dungeon. He is extremely seductive in the part, and I can't think of anyone in Hollywood who could have done a better job. With his mask, the Phantom is powerful, commanding, fearsome and magical.  Without it, he is like most of the rest of us in the world--weak, vulnerable, and emotionally fragile.

Gerard Butler plays the role of the Phantom so wonderfully, I honestly don't know how you could watch the movie without falling under his spell or without crying for the man. He gives so much emotion to a very complex character and pulls it off wonderfully. Emmy plays the conflicted Christine very well, also. Patrick Wilson almost made me LIKE Raoul- almost, but not quite. Erik and Christine FOREVER! Sorry, patrick :P. Minny driver plays the wonderful Sanish diva, Carlotta.

Truly a remarkable musical with drama, romance and a touch of tragedy, it is everything a muscial should be.  The cast is well played out, even though they had big shoes to fill.  Gerald Butler is a wonderful Phantom.  He brings a sexiness and youth to the role that previous Phantom I've seen did not.  You really do feel his obessive love for Christine and his pain when she betrays him.  Emmy Rossum is a wonderful Christine.  Emmy is a beautiful young lady who sings remarkably well.  It actually was more difficult for me to accept her as Christine than Butler as Phantom because this role was created specifically for Sarah Brightman.  However, Sarah is too old for the role now and Emmy does the job just as well.  Patrick Wilson (Raoul) was the one role I thought could have been improved in the movie.  I think they could have added a little star appeal to the movie and cast a hotter actor.  They dubbed Minnie Driver's voice, so dubbing another wouldn't have been that big of a deal.Overall, this movie has heart and keeps the spirit of the stage production.  The staging of this movie is simply stunning.  Minnie Driver's Carlotta adds for comic relief, as well as the opera house owners.The extras include a behind the scenes on how the show came to life.  It includes home videos of early productions and rehearsals with Sarah and Michael Crawford.  Truly, for this Phantom fan, this made the entire purchase sooooo worth it.

Gerard Butler does a decent job as the Phantom, sounding alternately sensitive and deranged, and Emmy Rossum gives a luminous performance as Christine.  Joel Schumacher's direction is well thought out, and sends the stage action winging from the rafters of the opera house to the depths of the Phantom's underground lair.Although more serious in tone and considerably more expensive, Phantom still begs some comparison to The Rocky Horror Picture Show as a new entry in the rock-horror musical subgenre.  Both films had their start on the London stage, Rocky Horror in 1973 (film released in 1975) and Phantom in 1986 (during a Rocky stage tour in England).  Both are updates of classic literature and film and feature intense leading characters.The connection between the Rocky Horror and Andrew Lloyd Webber camps dates back to 1972, when Webber and lyricist Tim Rice brought director Jim Sharman and set designer Brian Thomson from Australia to stage the London production of Jesus Christ Superstar.  In the cast was a young Londoner named Richard O'Brien, who soon quit over creative differences to write his own rock musical play.  The Rocky Horror Show, directed by Sharman and designed by Thomson, was a smash hit in England and ran for seven years before being revived.

890095,A2HVC1IXR56PPS,B0007TKNI8,J. McCormick,"[3, 3]","*** THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ***When I first went to see this movie, I wasn't sure whether to expect something great or something mediocre. I had been a little less than impressed with the preview material that had been released. I am happy to say that the film was a near-perfect translation of the musical to the screen.""Near-perfect"", yes. The film version of Phantom is not without its flaws. Certain lines were converted to dialog, presumably to make them seem more natural or something, but in fact they work better when sung. Gerard Butler has a good physical presence as the Phantom, but he clearly doesn't have the voice. Strangely enough, this doesn't detract from the movie as much as one might expect. Some of the musical cuts actually hurt the pacing of the movie, particularly near the end of the movie after ""Point of No Return"", where an additional 30 seconds or so of music was added that slowed (although did not stop) the momentum of that scene. And I think the counterpoint in ""Wandering Child"" - cut for the movie and some stage productions - adds a lot to that song.But these are all very minor complaints, as the overall quality of the movie translation overshadows them all. They are at worst minor annoyances. In many ways, the movie version is *better* than the stage version, in that a greater intimacy is possible on film than on stage, and here that works to great effect. For example, it would be difficult to show Raoul with slight tears in his eyes on stage, and yet in this film we get these more subtle effects, which serve to make Raoul a *much* more interesting character than he is on stage. I couldn't say whether a ""perfect"" stage production is better or worse than the movie, because the performance of this musical that I saw on stage had a mediocre cast and mediocre staging.There are things that happened in the movie that didn't happen in the stage version I saw, and they really made things more effective: the Phantom catching Christine when she faints, the highly sensual nature of ""Point of No Return"", Christine closing the Phantom's hand around the ring when she hands it back to him (in the stage version I saw, she held it out to him at arm's length).I thought many of the cuts in the story actually strengthened it rather than weakened it. While the stage version works well with the Don Juan rehearsal intact, I think that would have made the movie a bit boring, and in fact the move of the Phantom's jabs at everyone from a note (as on stage) to an in-person delivery (as in the movie) makes the Phantom seem a bit more bold yet aloof, which works very well, I think.All in all, this movie comes down to whether it captured the essence of the Phantom musical and whether it was moving.

890102,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0007TKNI8,Joe Sherry,"[1, 9]","A film by Joel SchumacherThis movie is an adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's long running Broadway musical ""The Phantom of the Opera"".  I imagine that most people have at least heard of the musical and that it has something to do with a phantom, and an opera, and that there is singing.  To be perfectly honest, that is the extent of my knowledge and experience of the stage musical.  Because of this lack of experience with the stage version, I had no preconceived notions of what ""Phantom"" should look like, or sound like, but only that it is supposed to be good and it has been wildly successful.  Andrew Lloyd Webber himself was involved in the casting of this project, especially in regards to Emmy Rossum as Christine.""The Phantom of the Opera"" begins with an auction in an old opera house where there is a chandelier which the auctioneer tells us featured prominently in the famous fracas with a ""phantom of the opera"" and that perhaps time will finally exorcise the phantom.  When the enormous chandelier is revealed we are greeted with a powerful blast of music as the dust and cobwebs and decay of the opera house are blown back and we see the opera house return to its former glory of years past.  The movie now takes us back to the time where the Phantom did, in fact, haunt the opera house.  When the resident diva of the opera, Carlotta (Minne Driver) is nearly hurt in an accident, a young girl from the chorus, Christine (Emmy Rossum) takes the lead with little time to rehearse or prepare.  She is a success and the new talk of the opera world and Raoul (Patrick Wilson), the patron of the new owners of the opera house is smitten with her.  It also seems that Christine and Raoul knew each other as children.Something strange happens next.  Christine is reluctant to dine with Raoul because her mysterious teacher wouldn't be happy, but we don't know who the teacher is (though we can guess).  When Raoul leaves her dressing room, the door locks, the candles blow out and we hear a voice sing out to Christine.  It is her teacher.  It is the Phantom (Gerard Butler).  Christine finally meets the Phantom, her teacher, and they spend some time together as he admonishes her about being faithful to him and his music and sings about ""the music of the night"".  Except for Christine, everybody else wants to be rid of the Phantom and thus begins the heart of the movie where Raoul and the Phantom both want Christine, Christine is initially unsure of her desires, and the Phantom continues to haunt and attack the opera if things do not go exactly the way he demands (and they don't).It seems unfair to criticize a movie based on a Broadway musical/rock opera of being ""too theatrical"".  Considering the origins of this movie, it only makes sense for it to be ""theatrical"".  Still, Gerard Butler flaps his cape at the camera more than one too many times.  It is as if he were trying out for the role of Count Dracula in some campy remake where he isn't supposed to be serious.  Except that he is supposed to be serious.  Which brings me to my next point: Butler as The Phantom isn't terribly menacing.  He is too pretty.  His mask seems more of a fashion accessory than something that is just covering up being disfigured.  Only when he is in the shadows and attacking people in secrecy do we truly get menace from Butler.  It is the unseen that brings the most tension to the character.  Butler has a nice voice and on some songs he sounds impressive, but much of his work here is absolutely ordinary.  Patrick Wilson, on the other hand, is no better.  He doesn't seem the sort of man who would impress Christine and there is no scene, no chemistry that shows us why they are interested in each other except that they knew each other as children.  The looming face off between Raoul and the Phantom just doesn't work for me.  The movie seemed long, a bit dull, and repetitive.There is much to praise in this movie, however.  The first thing that must be pointed out is that this is a beautiful looking movie.  It looks incredible.  The sets are fantastic, the costume design, the use of colors, all of it is just perfect.  Every scene change brings another fantastic image to the screen.  This is a gorgeous movie to look at.  The second praiseworthy part of this film is Emmy Rossum as Christine.  I don't know what Christine is supposed to look like or act like on stage, but here she radiates such an innocence that it is easy to see why the Phantom wants Christine for himself and why Raoul would be physically attracted to her.  Christine is pure.  Rossum can also sing quite well.  Her voice is what carries the movie as far as it can be carried.  The final bit of praise goes to the rest of the cast (excluding Butler and Wilson).  They are all excellent, including Minnie Driver as the diva Carlotta.  Perfectly overplayed (which is an odd thing for me to say considering my problems with Butler).""The Phantom of the Opera"" has quite a few things going for it, and I am quite sure that fans of the stage musical will be equally happy with this movie.  I wasn't quite so happy.  I am giving ""Phantom"" a very generous B- for the performance of Emmy Rossum and the look of the movie.-Joe Sherry",3,"something of a bore, but Rossum was fantastic",1104278400,"12 29,

890103,ACTG0NWGJMNSM,B0007TKNI8,"John Larsen ""Johncritic""","[7, 12]","As a theatrical production, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera incorporates the audience into the action, forcing them to become witting accomplices to the romance and mayhem that surrounds them. When the Phantom emerges from the dark, wet catacombs of the opera house to haunt the current production, the theater audience, by design, also become his victims, and when that grand, glorious chandelier comes crashing down, they take it personally.Except for the catalog of popular songs, which blast from the speakers in deafening Dolby, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera has very little personality. Experiencing the pomp and pageantry is one thing, sitting back and watching it is another. It doesn't take long before you wish a chandelier would crash through the screen. You know a movie is in trouble when you're rooting for the lighting.Filled with larger-than-life movie moments, what this Phantom lacks is a heart and soul. Those traits are built into the story and songs, but director Joel Schumacher and his cast leave little to be desired. What was once vibrant and stunning has become jarring and garish. As in the case of such great Hollywood musicals as Singing in the Rain and West Side Story, Phantom would have benefitted with the presence of two directors.That would have allowed this Phantom to have his torte and eat it too. A dramatic director would have been able to bring some level of reason to the romance, helping counterbalance Schumacher's glitter and sequin production design. Phantom is pretty to look at, but that's part of the problem. It's too pretty. There's no nuance or menace in the lighting, robbing this Phantom of any expectation. When the Phantom is lit better than Barbra Streisand, he becomes picture postcard pretty.That's because he's played by young Gerard Butler, whose jet black hair, chiseled jaw and porcelain doll complexion paint him more as a rock star doing a charity concert than someone who has been scarred and abandoned by society. Up until now, the Phantom has been depicted as something of a monster, a musical genius forced to hide from life and love. One look at Butler's Phantom and you wonder what all the fuss is about.It's hard to lurk around in the shadows when the dark corners of the opera house are better lit than most public restrooms.Indeed, the production design is grand and glorious, every chamber, every street, every rooftop and catacomb a wonder to behold. Designer Anthony Pratt gives Schumacher his money's worth, but at what cost? Schumacher shortchanges the actors by forcing them to compete with the scenery, inflating every emotion to match the wallpaper. His cast is serviceable but not spectacular, something this Phantom deserves. Emmy Rossum is pretty and delicate as Christine Daae, plucked from the chorus line by the Phantom to star in his new opera. When the Phantom speaks, people listen, and when they don't, people die.So when the man behind the mask falls for Christine, he sets off a romantic tug-of-war with her suitor, Raoul (Patrick Wilson), who vows to keep Christine safe from the music of the night.

Take the mask off, and really, he's still not entirely loathsome - so when he was singing to Christine about his hideousness, I kept expecting her to chime in with, ""Really, have you looked in the mirror? You're not so bad!"" I understand that the initial story had the Phantom as a more horrifying, deformed creature. I saw a picture - and yes, the Phantom was far from pretty. But the musical was written around a loathsome Phantom and the Phantom simply isn't loathsome, unless you count what's inside of him - that he's possessive and murderous. That, most certainly, is loathsome. I leaned over to my friend and commented once that the Phantom doesn't seem to understand that the gift is in the giving.I'm referring, of course, to his indignant anger at having taught Christine all she knows about music, setting the stage - quite literally - for her to become the star of the show, writing shows for her, and then when she runs into her childhood love she ""forsakes"" him, although certainly there was nothing to forsake.Roger Ebert said, ""In this version, any red-blooded woman would choose the Phantom over Raoul, even knowing what she knows now"". I'm not sure what movie he was watching. He's specifically comparing the physical attractiveness of the Phantom and Raoul. Well, not every red-blooded woman would choose the Phantom over Raoul. I know plenty who think that Paul Wilson, who played Raoul, is ""fine"". Then again, Roger Ebert may not be the best person to judge another man's looks.Ebert also said that the music is bland, repetitive, and not likely to have people humming the tunes as they left the theater. I left humming several tunes, and it took a while for me to get them out of my head. That said, I do agree that the music is repetitive in some places. But how ingenious can such a prolific writer of music be expected to be? Writers of books have certain techniques that they employ, they write a certain way - even when they're using different techniques they have invented to shake up their writing. You can still tell it's the same writer, for the most part. So I don't expect every single song from Andrew Lloyd Webber to be a perfectly original masterpiece.The movie itself looked magnificent. All of the sets, from the stage, to the cemetery, and especially the dungeons of the Phantom were spectacular, an absolute visual delight. The performance of Masquerade was truly a thing of beauty, with warm golden tones emanating like balls of sunshine from every inch of the frame, with the magnificent colors of a New England autumn folded over the gilded beauty to force your eyes to the screen.It's a pity that it's not doing very well at the box office. It was made for about $60 million, and so far it's only made $21.5, and in Europe about $10. It deserves much better - and I hope it gets it.",5,Beautiful Phantom,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,3176,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'musical', 'am', 'familiar', 'music', 'am', 'perhaps', 'perfect', 'candidate', 'regardless', 'not', 'write', 'well', 'sense', 'lt', '>', 'review', 'purely', 'film.And', 'film', 'loved', 'it.Certainly', 'had', 'problem', 'monster', 'Phantom', 'who', 'heaven', 'Hades', 'being', 'so', 'handsome', 'Take', 'mask', 'really', 'still', 'not', 'entirely', 'loathsome', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'singing', 'Christine', 'hideousness', 'kept', 'expecting', 'chime', 'Really', 'have', 'looked', 'mirror', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'understand', 'initial', 'story', 'had', 'Phantom', 'more', 'horrifying', 'deformed', 'creature', 'saw', 'picture', 'yes', 'Phantom', 'was', 'far', 'pretty', 'musical', 'was', 'written', 'loathsome', 'Phantom', 'Phantom', 'simply', ""n't"", 'loathsome', 'count', 'what', 'inside', 'possessive', 'murderous', 'most', 'certainly', 'loathsome', 'leaned', 'friend', 'commented', 'once', 'Phantom', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'gift', 'giving.I', ""'m"", 'referring', 'course', 'indignant', 'anger', 'having', 'taught', 'Christine', 'music', 'setting', 'stage', 'quite', 'literally', 'become', 'star', 'show', 'writing', 'shows', 'then', 'when', 'childhood', 'love', 'forsakes', 'certainly', 'was', 'nothing', 'forsake.Roger', 'Ebert', 'said', 'version', 'red-blooded', 'woman', 'would', 'choose', 'Phantom', 'Raoul', 'even', 'knowing', 'what', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'watching', 'specifically', 'comparing', 'physical', 'attractiveness', 'Phantom', 'Raoul', 'Well', 'not', 'red-blooded', 'woman', 'would', 'choose', 'Phantom', 'Raoul', 'know', 'plenty', 'who', 'think', 'Paul', 'Wilson', 'who', 'played', 'Raoul', 'fine', 'Then', 'again', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'person', 'judge', 'man', 'looks.Ebert', 'also', 'said', 'music', 'bland', 'repetitive', 'not', 'likely', 'have', 'people', 'humming', 'tunes', 'left', 'theater', 'left', 'humming', 'several', 'tunes', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'head', 'said', 'do', 'agree', 'music', 'repetitive', 'places', 'how', 'ingenious', 'can', 'such', 'prolific', 'writer', 'music', 'be', 'expected', 'be', 'Writers', 'books', 'have', 'certain', 'techniques', 'employ', 'write', 'certain', 'way', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'using', 'different', 'techniques', 'have', 'invented', 'shake', 'up', 'writing', 'can', 'still', 'tell', 'same', 'writer', 'most', 'part', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'single', 'song', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'be', 'perfectly', 'original', 'masterpiece.The', 'movie', 'looked', 'magnificent', 'sets', 'stage', 'cemetery', 'especially', 'dungeons', 'Phantom', 'were', 'spectacular', 'absolute', 'visual', 'delight', 'performance', 'Masquerade', 'was', 'truly', 'thing', 'beauty', 'warm', 'golden', 'tones', 'emanating', 'balls', 'sunshine', 'inch', 'frame', 'magnificent', 'colors', 'New', 'England', 'autumn', 'folded', 'gilded', 'beauty', 'force', 'eyes', 'screen.It', 'pity', 'not', 'doing', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'made', 'about', '60', 'million', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'made', '21.5', 'Europe', '10', 'much', 'better', 'hope']",N/A

I only remember that the wooden seats were uncomfortably hard, and that I came away thinking ""chick story"". The cinema seat for this Big Screen version was much friendlier to my couch potato tushy, but it's still a ""chick flick"" in the same way that FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS was a ""guy flick"". Of course, I dragged my wife to the latter.The convenient thing about musicals is that the plots are usually simple, often simplistic. OK, so here we have this guy with a facial deformity, The Phantom (Gerard Butler), who, as a child, escaped from a freak show and took refuge in a palatial Parisian opera house; he's managed to live there his entire life. His living space is in the structure's bowels, replete with guttering candles, slimy hanging stuff, and lots of murky, green water. Nevertheless, he manages an elegant wardrobe, topped off by an anachronistically cheesy mask that covers the half of his face that needs plastic surgery. Psychologically, he has issues. In any case, he's somewhat of a musical genius that composes operas for house presentation. He becomes enthralled with a pretty, young actress, Christine (Emy Rossum), who's managed, on the strength of an absolutely fab singing voice, to supplant the resident diva, Carlotta (Minnie Driver). The Phantom competes for Christine's affections with the establishment's patron, Vicompte Raoul (Patrick Wilson).Emy Rossum is radiant as Christine, but unconvincing in her romantic attentions to either Raoul or The Phantom, perhaps because she ricochets back and forth between the two for most of the movie. I'd have dumped her for somebody more committed. Minnie Driver is wonderful as the annoying and conceited Carlotta, but then I find all of Driver's film personae annoying; it was inspired casting. Butler was a poor choice for The Phantom; he seemed an inadequate clone of, say, a young Antonio Banderas. Raoul might just as well have been a cardboard cut-out. And at well over two hours, the run time of the film approaches mind-numbing.But, I'm still awarding FOUR stars and recommending a look-see because the costuming and sets are eye-popping. Why, the candle expense alone would bankrupt a small country. The fact that THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA wasn't nominated for an Oscar for Best Achievement in Costuming is appalling; they wuz robbed.

890113,A2CZBGIJP8TZ1T,B0007TKNI8,Joy,"[8, 11]","I have seen many versions of The Phantom Of The Opera. I've seen the 1925 version with Lon Chaney, the one with Claude Rains, the 80's version with Robert Englund and the 1990 one with Charles Dance which is actually my all time favorite movie along with this 2004 Phantom film. I also own the Original Cast Recording CD and the Original Motion Picture soundtrack to this film. When I first heard about this movie coming out in December, I knew I would like it but I really didn't think I would totally fall in love with it like I have. I saw the film in the theatre over 30 times because I love it so much and it is so romantic and artistic that it was like they made the film just for me. Since I am this total hopeless romantic, this film is MY FILM!! I bought the 2 disc DVD the day it came out and have already watched everything and have seen some parts more than once. It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to movies because I don't need nudity and cursing or just a bunch of people getting drunk and stuff like that.What really impresses me about this film is the whole artistic and romantic setting. Like all the candlebras and roses and everything is covered in gold and even the stage curtain looks like real velvet. They use real animals in the shows and in The Phantom Of The Opera, there is a real horse. The actual theatre is covered with red velvet, gold and statues and the chandelier looks like it's made out of real diamonds and gold. And all the romantic things that both The Phantom/Gerard Butler and Raoul/Patrick Wilson do are just so breathtaking and powerful. Like when the Phantom is singing to her in The Music Of The Night, I can see so much passion between the two and he just takes and holds her hand and after she faints, he carries her to the bed and he doesn't even try to do anything sexual with her. He pulls down that curtain around the bed. I just totally love that. And Raoul sings his heart out to Christine up on the rooftop in All I Ask Of You about how much he loves her, he doesn't try to have sex with her. They share this very romantic, passionate kiss and every time I see the All I Ask Of You scene, I start to cry because it's so romantic and wish that could happen to me!  I wish I could find a man as romantic as they two are. The Phantom Of The Opera scene is so powerful that it totally takes my breath away!!  I love how they filmed Christine and The Phantom going down the stairs as Christine sings ""The Phantom Of The Opera Is There, Inside My Mind.""  I also love the Masquerade ball, it's amazing musically, vocally, visually. I love how Christine and Raoul dance and then share this kiss!  My all time favorite scenes are The Phantom Of The Opera, The Music Of The Night, All I Ask Of You, Masquerade and The Overture. I watch those over and over again.All the other cast members are amazing also. Minnie Driver plays a really funny Carlotta, and Andre/Simon Callow and Firmin/Ciaran Hinds are funny whenever they talk about scrap metal. I always laugh when they say scrap metal.As far as the music and singing goes, it's so incredible and musically, it's better than the Original Cast Recording because they had over a 100 piece orchestra which sounds so much better and fuller. The singing is definitely one big reason I also love this film. Emmy Rossum/Christine has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard and to be honest there are a lot of parts where Emmy does a better job than Sarah Brightman did. On The Point Of No Return/Don Juan, when Emmy sings ""When will the flames at last consume us"" she hits this really low register and it sounds so amazing and incredible. I also love it when Emmy sings really high in the very first part of the Don Juan opera. She also hits this really high note and holds it in that part right before All I Ask Of You starts. Emmy also shows her emotions through her singing unlike Sarah Brightman. At the very end when Christine is singing to the Phantom, ""The tears I might have shed for your dark fate, grow cold, and turn to tears of hate"" you can hear the hatred in Emmy's voice. Gerard Butler who plays The Phantom might not be as good as Michael Crawford but there are a few parts that I feel Gerard has done a better job.  Especially after Christine kisses him at the end, you can hear him crying and feel his heartache. They are all incredible but I listen to the Phantom soundtrack a lot just to hear Emmy's voice. This film is now my favorite along with the Charles Dance version.The special features on the 2nd disc were really cool because I found out so much information. The Behind the mask: The story of The Phantom Of The Opera actually shows footage from inside the real Paris Opera House and there really is an underground lake and saw some creature swimming around which looks really cool. They also show a lot of shots from the Broadway musical with Sarah Brightman. It shows Sarah singing in a church. I was amazed that they put in some info about past versions of the film and showed a picture from the 1990 version with Charles Dance who is my favorite actor of all time. The Making Of The Phantom Of The Opera is in 3 parts, Preproduction, The Director, and Production. In these 3 parts, you will see interviews with Andrew Lloyd Webber, Joel Schumacher, Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler, Patrick Wilson, Minnie Driver, Miranda Richardson, Simon Callow, Kevin R McNally who plays Buquet, Jennifer Ellison who plays Meg, and many others including the lyricist Charles Hart. And these bonus features are over an hour each.The third feature, which I've seen a lot of reviews stating that it's The Phantom singing Learn To Be Lonely, it's NOT Learn To Be Lonely, it's No One Would Listen! It's the same melody but the lyrics are totally different! No One Would Listen is sung by the Phantom and is an additional scene not shown in the film and it's a very short scene and they should have included it in the film. There is also an Easter Egg that's a Sing A Long to The Phantom Of The Opera and shows Emmy twice and a lot of other Cast and Crew members singing and it's very funny!!! The last thing is a DVD-ROM PC Weblink extra also if you have a PC that will play it but unfortunately, my computer doesn't have a DVD-ROM but that's not a big deal because eventually I will get a PC with a DVD-ROM. I highly recommend this to all Phantom fans and romantics!!!

890116,A1LVZOK9F7K4CN,B0007TKNI8,JR Pinto,"[475, 561]","I have just seen Andrew Lloyd Weber's The Phantom of the Opera last night and I still don't quite know how to feel about it.  This is my favorite Broadway musical of all time.  I have been privileged enough to see it twice on stage with the inimitable Michael Crawford.  This Phantom is significantly different - both the production and the character.  On stage, the Phantom is an older man who is missing most of his face.  In this film, the Phantom is so young and so sexy we wonder why Christine would ever be interested in Raoul.  The movie has more time and ability to go into the Phantom's backstory - the problem is the backstory makes no sense!  In the book, it was explained that Erik was the son of a master mason who grew up to be one of the contractors who worked on the opera house.  In the movie, he is a child who is rescued from a freak show by Madame Giry who has grown up in the opera house.  (Perhaps that gave him time to install a pipe-organ single-handedly.)  Joel Schumacher has tried to ""humanize"" the Phantom, which is the wrong decision because - like Hamlet - the Phantom is a larger-than-life character.  The worst filmmaking decision is to have the Phantom swordfight Raoul...and lose!  The Phantom is like Hannibal Lecter - he would NEVER let anybody get the upper hand on him.  In the play, the Phantom spends most of the time off-stage, creating an air of mystery.  Also, in the play, he has more of a devilish sense of humor.  The movie phantom does not move in the same way the stage phantom does - gone are the balletic gestures that accompany The Music of the Night.In the hands of a better filmmaker, this would have been a better movie.  Shumacher is a little uncomfortable about having the characters sing directly into the camera.  He cares more about the story than the music and seems to be happiest when he is adding extra scenes.  He also misses opportunities to do things with film - superimpositions and the like - that cannot be done on stage.  Emmy Rossum is great as Christine.  Patrick Wilson is a fine singer to play Raoul - a character I have never liked.  Gerard Butler has the thankless job of being ""the guy who isn't Michael Crawford.""However, there is much that the movie does get right.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, it keeps the score intact.  There are a few minor changes - some lines are spoken rather than sung, which is REALLY annoying.  The movie LOOKS beautiful.  The set pieces translate wonderfully to the film.  When we hear the overture, there is an electric moment - literally - when the chandelier comes to life and the old opera house rejuvenates.  The transition in the song Think of Me occurs perfectly.  The journey through the mirror and into the labyrinth is fantastic.  Much of the special effects from the stage show are preserved.  Even a few new additions are here from the book: the horse and the torture chamber!Do I recommend the movie?  Wholeheartedly.  Is the film a satisfying interpretation of the stage play?  No - it is just too different.  Characters and relationships are altered for the worse.  Watching the movie, I became grateful that the play is still running strong all over the world and shows no signs of stopping.  I can't wait to see it on stage again - where it belongs.  This film - taken on its own merits - is still great.  Even though I will see the movie again many times in my life, it cannot compare to the stage version.  The theater occupies a world too surreal to ever be adequately captured on film.",5,I HAVE SEEN IT!!!,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,3503,"['have', 'just', 'seen', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Weber', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'last', 'night', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'feel', 'favorite', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'privileged', 'enough', 'see', 'twice', 'stage', 'inimitable', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'Phantom', 'significantly', 'different', 'production', 'character', 'stage', 'Phantom', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'missing', 'most', 'face', 'film', 'Phantom', 'so', 'young', 'so', 'sexy', 'wonder', 'why', 'Christine', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'interested', 'Raoul', 'movie', 'more', 'time', 'ability', 'go', 'Phantom', 'backstory', 'problem', 'backstory', 'sense', 'book', 'was', 'explained', 'Erik', 'was', 'son', 'master', 'mason', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'be', 'one', 'contractors', 'who', 'worked', 'opera', 'house', 'movie', 'child', 'who', 'rescued', 'freak', 'show', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'opera', 'house', 'Perhaps', 'gave', 'time', 'install', 'pipe-organ', 'single-handedly', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'tried', 'humanize', 'Phantom', 'wrong', 'decision', 'Hamlet', 'Phantom', 'larger-than-life', 'character', 'worst', 'filmmaking', 'decision', 'have', 'Phantom', 'swordfight', 'Raoul', 'lose', 'Phantom', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'would', 'NEVER', 'let', 'anybody', 'get', 'upper', 'hand', 'play', 'Phantom', 'most', 'time', 'off-stage', 'creating', 'air', 'mystery', 'Also', 'play', 'more', 'devilish', 'sense', 'humor', 'movie', 'phantom', 'not', 'move', 'same', 'way', 'stage', 'phantom', 'gone', 'are', 'balletic', 'gestures', 'accompany', 'Music', 'Night.In', 'hands', 'better', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'Shumacher', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'having', 'characters', 'sing', 'directly', 'camera', 'more', 'story', 'music', 'be', 'happiest', 'when', 'adding', 'extra', 'scenes', 'also', 'opportunities', 'do', 'things', 'film', 'superimpositions', 'like', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'stage', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'great', 'Christine', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'fine', 'singer', 'play', 'Raoul', 'character', 'have', 'never', 'liked', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'thankless', 'job', 'being', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'However', 'much', 'movie', 'get', 'right', 'MOST', 'IMPORTANTLY', 'score', 'intact', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'changes', 'lines', 'are', 'spoken', 'rather', 'sung', 'REALLY', 'annoying', 'movie', 'LOOKS', 'beautiful', 'set', 'pieces', 'translate', 'wonderfully', 'film', 'When', 'hear', 'overture', 'electric', 'moment', 'literally', 'when', 'chandelier', 'life', 'old', 'opera', 'house', 'transition', 'song', 'Think', 'Me', 'perfectly', 'journey', 'mirror', 'labyrinth', 'fantastic', 'Much', 'special', 'effects', 'stage', 'show', 'are', 'preserved', 'Even', 'few', 'new', 'additions', 'are', 'here', 'book', 'horse', 'torture', 'chamber', 'Do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Wholeheartedly', 'film', 'satisfying', 'interpretation', 'stage', 'play', 'No', 'just', 'too', 'different', 'Characters', 'relationships', 'are', 'altered', 'worse', 'Watching', 'movie', 'became', 'grateful', 'play', 'still', 'running', 'strong', 'world', 'signs', 'stopping', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'stage', 'again', 'where', 'film', 'taken', 'own', 'merits', 'still', 'great', 'Even', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'many', 'times', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'stage', 'version', 'theater', 'world', 'too', 'surreal', 'ever', 'be', 'adequately', 'captured', 'film']",N/A

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[3, 6]","I first saw Phantom of the Opera with an unbiased view: I knew nothing about it except the names of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. I was mesmerized! I was emotionalized! I was hooked! Perfect acting, perfect casting, perfect music, perfect productions. OK, it would have been better if Minnie Driver had sung with her own voice--that's my only complaint, and a minor one at that.I have watched the film over and over and am equally moved each time with this desperately sad story of unrequited love, but then again this ending of this version has possibilities.Anything I say about Gerard Butler will be redundant, I am sure, or of  Emmy Rossum or Patrick Wilson, so I will focus on the music. I have listened to the soundtrack over and over and have formulated the opinion that Andrew Lloyd Webber's music has parallels with Beethoven's music. It is as rich in the romantic tradition of high and low notes, much musicality, repetition of same and similar musical phrases and songs, each version engendered with a new slant. Has a musically trained person noticed the parallels? I would like to know.Footnote: After my familiarity with the movie version, I ordered the CD of the stage production with Crawford and Brightman. Ug, I resold it on Amazon.

He does a wonderful job in acting and his singing is good considering that he is not an opera singer. Emmy Rossum is spectacular as Christine, young and innocent. Both of them have great chemistry, look great together and show passion.I don't know why people keep saying that the Phantom is too young. He is 35 and Christine is 18. He is much older than her but still young enough to be a love interest. Who wants to see a 50 year old phantom?And as for comparing them to Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, what's the deal with that? I haven't seen the stage show but I downloaded Brightman's and Crawford's The Phantom of the Opera song and they are far from being impressive. Brightman's voice is not as strong as Rossum's, not even close. And Crawford sounds too much like a woman, doesn't strike me as a dark and mysterious phantom. Butler and Rossum are much better actors for the part and they did a much better job at singing.Their is nothing wrong with the movie, the actors are young and pleasant to look at and listen to, the sets are spectacular and the costumes are beautiful.

I never read the original French novel and this is the only version I enjoyed. The production is so rich in its contents and presentation that it's difficult to give credit to a single performer for the wholesome experience. The soundtrack was awesome, and despite the occasional humor, the tragedy never failed to claim on the audience's emotion. What did actually win in the end, love or chivalry? Are they really that different? What was really important to the ""Phantom""--love for the beloved or the love itself?Occasionally, towards the end of the movie, I kept thinking about the Ugly Duckling of Hans Andersen. The movie brought me closer to the conviction I have carried within me that deep down, most of us carry a beast, frustrated in its solitary castle, awaiting a beauty to see through the outer layer and break the curse of solitude, as if a healing awaiting to happen.I encourage you to watch it.Excellent work.

890125,A1QLMFG5R5IFAM,B0007TKNI8,kam24,"[2, 9]","I thought overall the movie was pretty good. I think a lot of people hated it because it's very different from the musical which is extremly popular and well known. It also doesn't have much similarity to Leroux's original novel. The movie had a lot to live up to and it didn't live up to it at all. I found that most of my friends who really loved it weren't that famaliar with the story or had never seen the musical. Friends who had seen the musical were a bit more critcal. Being a die hard Phantom fan myself I did find myself getting quite annoyed with some aspects of the film. Now for the good and the bad:Good-The cinematography was beautiful. There were some awesome scences in the movie (Christine's father's grave) which were absoulutly breath taking. Masquerade scence was pretty well done but wasn't as good as seeing it live. Rossum did a mostly good performance of Christine. She has a good voice and portrayed her innocence well. Her's was one of the better singing performances. The guy who played Rauol also did surprisingly well for the character. Everyone knows Rauol is a whining babbling wuss but I didn't find him as annoying in the film. Butler did okay, but I'll get to him later. I also was surprisngly feeling for the Butler at the end. I didn't think his acting would persaude me to do so but it actually did. The acting overall was mostly enertaing and kept me watching.Bad-The lip sinking was horrible. It didn;t even look like they were singing, especially Rossum. It really bugged me because I'm a singer and I KNOW you can't sing with your mouth an inch open. It's kind of ironic that Driver was the most believable singing and she was the only one in the movie who didn't use her actual voice. Okay, I know a lot of people hated Butler and I mostly agree with them. They could have found someone way better. He isn't an altogher bad singer, he was just miscast. They should have found someone with more of a range to their voice. I kinda feel bad for the guy cause when you think of the Phantom you think of Micheal Crawford, and he's hard to beat. Crawford and Sarah Brightan were sooo good and it's hard to match them. Okay the sword fight with Raoul and the Phantom. What was that? We all know Erik could destroy Rauol in a heartbeat. The end of that fight was just stupid. And that backstory with madame giry was horrible. If Erik didn't build the Oprea house then why were there so many secret passageways and how could he be a great arcitect without traveling the world? They just did that to give miranda richardson more screen time. Also, Erik's face wasn't even scary. He barely had a scratch. The thing that bugged me the most was the ending scene. There is no possible way that Erik could have put the ring on her grave. He was 50 when she was 18. He was obvousily not around when she eventually died.Conclusion-To apperiate the film you have to see it as just that: a movie. If you start comparing it to the musical or the book you're going to end up being disappointed. It doesn't hold a candle to the musical. I think it's just something that's more enjoyable live. I would recommend the movie because it's entertaining but don't expect too much or you'll end up disappointed.",3,Phantom review,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,3225,"['thought', 'overall', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'hated', 'very', 'different', 'musical', 'extremly', 'popular', 'well', 'known', 'also', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'similarity', 'Leroux', 'original', 'novel', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'found', 'most', 'friends', 'who', 'really', 'loved', 'were', ""n't"", 'famaliar', 'story', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'musical', 'Friends', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'musical', 'were', 'bit', 'more', 'critcal', 'Being', 'die', 'hard', 'Phantom', 'fan', 'did', 'find', 'getting', 'quite', 'annoyed', 'aspects', 'film', 'Now', 'good', 'bad', 'Good-The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'were', 'awesome', 'scences', 'movie', 'Christine', 'father', 'grave', 'were', 'absoulutly', 'breath', 'taking', 'Masquerade', 'scence', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'seeing', 'live', 'Rossum', 'did', 'mostly', 'good', 'performance', 'Christine', 'good', 'voice', 'portrayed', 'innocence', 'well', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'singing', 'performances', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Rauol', 'also', 'did', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'character', 'Everyone', 'Rauol', 'whining', 'babbling', 'wuss', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'annoying', 'film', 'Butler', 'did', 'okay', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later', 'also', 'was', 'surprisngly', 'feeling', 'Butler', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'acting', 'would', 'persaude', 'do', 'so', 'actually', 'did', 'acting', 'overall', 'was', 'mostly', 'enertaing', 'kept', 'watching.Bad-The', 'lip', 'sinking', 'was', 'horrible', 't', 'even', 'look', 'were', 'singing', 'especially', 'Rossum', 'really', 'bugged', ""'m"", 'singer', 'KNOW', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'mouth', 'inch', 'open', 'kind', 'ironic', 'Driver', 'was', 'most', 'believable', 'singing', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'actual', 'voice', 'Okay', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'hated', 'Butler', 'mostly', 'agree', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'someone', 'way', 'better', ""n't"", 'altogher', 'bad', 'singer', 'was', 'just', 'miscast', 'should', 'have', 'found', 'someone', 'more', 'range', 'voice', 'kinda', 'feel', 'bad', 'guy', 'cause', 'when', 'think', 'Phantom', 'think', 'Micheal', 'Crawford', 'hard', 'beat', 'Crawford', 'Sarah', 'Brightan', 'were', 'sooo', 'good', 'hard', 'match', 'Okay', 'sword', 'fight', 'Raoul', 'Phantom', 'What', 'was', 'know', 'Erik', 'could', 'destroy', 'Rauol', 'heartbeat', 'end', 'fight', 'was', 'just', 'stupid', 'backstory', 'madame', 'giry', 'was', 'horrible', 'Erik', 'did', ""n't"", 'build', 'Oprea', 'house', 'then', 'why', 'were', 'there', 'so', 'many', 'secret', 'passageways', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'arcitect', 'traveling', 'world', 'just', 'did', 'give', 'miranda', 'richardson', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Also', 'Erik', 'face', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'scary', 'barely', 'had', 'scratch', 'thing', 'bugged', 'most', 'was', 'ending', 'scene', 'possible', 'way', 'Erik', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'ring', 'grave', 'was', '50', 'when', 'was', '18', 'was', 'obvousily', 'not', 'when', 'eventually', 'died.Conclusion-To', 'apperiate', 'film', 'have', 'see', 'as', 'just', 'movie', 'start', 'comparing', 'musical', 'book', ""'re"", 'going', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'musical', 'think', 'just', 'something', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'live', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'disappointed']",N/A

It was brilliant to use black and white for the portions of the movie that aren't as vibrant.  It was brilliant to blend the play with some portions of the book that never made it to the play.  And the ability to choose camera angles lent the filmmakers freedom to show us details we might not have been able to pick up from a stage production.I feel like the people who made the film really used available resources to the best of their potential, and they deserve applause for that.  There were times when actors appeared to be lip-synching because their mouths seemed not to be open far enough to let such powerful sound emerge, but maybe their lungs are just that strong.  Also, the Phantom struck me as being a little on the young side--it's hard for a handsome young man to keep the dark, disturbing father-figure thing going.Still, I thought the movie was fantastic.

890140,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B0007TKNI8,Kenji Fujishima,"[4, 11]","Andrew Lloyd Webber's Broadway musical version of Gaston Leroux's Gothic horror tale of The Phantom of the Opera is one of the most popular musicals of all time---it's still running, at the Majestic Theater---but, going into Joel Schumacher's film adaptation of the musical, I had never seen it onstage (nor have I read the book). I had heard some of the original cast recording, and marveled at Michael Crawford's intensity and vocal beauty in the role of the lovelorn Phantom. Otherwise, I basically went into the film cold...and, with some qualifications, that's the way I left.Oh, it's not a terrible movie, I suppose. I, for one, am perfectly willing to defend Lloyd Webber's often-derided music: it may be derivative; and Lloyd Webber may not know the first thing about musical development (doesn't ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" sound too much like...well, every other big ballad in the musical, especially ""Angel of Music""?); but, at climactic points, it is so lusciously orchestrated that, especially towards the end, I couldn't help but be enchanted by the score. I was much less enchanted by the lyrics, which seems so divorced from context that I stopped paying attention to the words after a while.Additionally, I have to admit, as simply a parade of visual glamor, Joel Schumacher makes an ideal leader. He has an unmistakable eye for beautiful imagery, both pretty and creepy. His imagining of Paris from the rooftop of the Paris Opera is breathtaking; so is the image of Christine walking through falling snow in a cemetery. Some of the imagery is pretty amazing...but it amazes only as eye candy, with very little expressive depth to the images other than its own slick pictorial wonderfulness.And that, in essence, is what is wrong with this movie: for all of its romantic huffing and puffing, this Phantom of the Opera lacks soul. The central romantic triangle between the poor Phantom (Gerard Butler), soprano Christine (Emmy Rossum), and Christine's boyfriend Raoul (Patrick Wilson) has all the weight of something out of a high school drama. And, fatally, there is very little terror or romantic warmth to be found in any of this overbaked film's agonizingly labored 143 minutes. It's all cinematographer John Mathieson's pretty pictures in the service of a thin and ultimately uninvolving plot. (Surely, Gaston Leroux's book must have been something more than a mere Gothic soap opera.) Only at the end do the filmmakers generate a palpable feeling of sadness---but, by then, I felt too exhausted to make much of an effort to connect with the characters.A word about the performances. Of the three leads, Patrick Wilson has the worst luck; he's saddled with a bland, personality-free character, and unfortunately Wilson---so much more involving as tortured gay Mormon Joe Pitt in Mike Nichols' HBO miniseries Angels in America---does little to bring life to the underwritten part. As the Phantom, Butler is more effective---he's at his most touching in the film's grand finale---but he certainly doesn't efface memories of Michael Crawford, either vocally or emotionally. (Not only that, but Butler is way too young and handsome for the part of the ugly, father-figure Phantom; when his mask finally comes off, he looks less like Lon Chaney---who played the Phantom in Rupert Julian's 1925 horror film version of the story---than a GQ model with scar tissue.) Emmy Rossum, of course, has garnered most of the acclaim from this movie. She is an appealing young actress who can sing (although her singing voice doesn't come close to suggesting one that would earn her popularity as an opera singer; for all her limitations as an actress, Sarah Brightman at least sounded operatic), but, truth be told, I found her performance bland overall. As hard as she tried to convey desperation and yearning, I rarely felt that Rossum truly felt those emotions herself; those facial expressions of hers as she is being seduced seem more calculated than spontaneous. The only actor in the cast who makes a real impression is Minnie Driver, who hams it up impressively as Carlotta, the overbearing diva with an Italian accent two miles wide. It's a humorous caricature, but she's not onscreen for very long.In short, only if you value visual and aural glitz over genuine emotional substance will you find this Phantom of the Opera to be worthwhile. Otherwise, I'd say skip it.",3,"Great visuals, good music, but overall a disappointing movie",1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,4391,"['Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'version', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', 'Gothic', 'horror', 'tale', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'musicals', 'time', '-it', 'still', 'running', 'Majestic', 'Theater', '-but', 'going', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'film', 'adaptation', 'musical', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'onstage', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'had', 'heard', 'original', 'cast', 'recording', 'marveled', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'intensity', 'vocal', 'beauty', 'role', 'lovelorn', 'Phantom', 'Otherwise', 'basically', 'went', 'film', 'cold', 'qualifications', 'way', 'left.Oh', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'suppose', 'one', 'am', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'defend', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'often-derided', 'music', 'may', 'be', 'derivative', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'first', 'thing', 'musical', 'development', ""n't"", 'Wishing', 'Were', 'Somehow', 'Here', 'Again', 'sound', 'too', 'much', 'well', 'other', 'big', 'ballad', 'musical', 'especially', 'Angel', 'Music', 'climactic', 'points', 'so', 'lusciously', 'orchestrated', 'especially', 'end', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'enchanted', 'score', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'enchanted', 'lyrics', 'so', 'divorced', 'context', 'stopped', 'paying', 'attention', 'words', 'while.Additionally', 'have', 'admit', 'simply', 'parade', 'visual', 'glamor', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'ideal', 'leader', 'unmistakable', 'eye', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'imagining', 'Paris', 'rooftop', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'breathtaking', 'image', 'Christine', 'walking', 'falling', 'snow', 'cemetery', 'imagery', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'only', 'eye', 'candy', 'very', 'little', 'expressive', 'depth', 'images', 'other', 'own', 'slick', 'pictorial', 'wonderfulness.And', 'essence', 'what', 'wrong', 'movie', 'romantic', 'huffing', 'puffing', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'soul', 'central', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'poor', 'Phantom', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'soprano', 'Christine', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Christine', 'boyfriend', 'Raoul', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'weight', 'something', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'fatally', 'very', 'little', 'terror', 'romantic', 'warmth', 'be', 'found', 'overbaked', 'film', 'agonizingly', 'labored', '143', 'minutes', 'cinematographer', 'John', 'Mathieson', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'service', 'thin', 'ultimately', 'uninvolving', 'plot', 'Surely', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', 'book', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'more', 'mere', 'Gothic', 'soap', 'opera', 'Only', 'end', 'do', 'filmmakers', 'generate', 'palpable', 'feeling', 'sadness', '-but', 'then', 'felt', 'too', 'exhausted', 'make', 'much', 'effort', 'connect', 'characters.A', 'word', 'performances', 'three', 'leads', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'worst', 'luck', 'saddled', 'bland', 'personality-free', 'character', 'unfortunately', 'Wilson', '-so', 'much', 'more', 'involving', 'tortured', 'gay', 'Mormon', 'Joe', 'Pitt', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'HBO', 'miniseries', 'Angels', 'America', 'little', 'bring', 'life', 'underwritten', 'part', 'Phantom', 'Butler', 'more', 'effective', '-he', 'most', 'touching', 'film', 'grand', 'finale', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'efface', 'memories', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'either', 'vocally', 'emotionally', 'Not', 'only', 'Butler', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'handsome', 'part', 'ugly', 'father-figure', 'Phantom', 'when', 'mask', 'finally', 'off', 'less', 'Lon', 'Chaney', '-who', 'played', 'Phantom', 'Rupert', 'Julian', '1925', 'horror', 'film', 'version', 'story', '-than', 'GQ', 'model', 'scar', 'tissue', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'course', 'garnered', 'most', 'acclaim', 'movie', 'appealing', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'sing', 'singing', 'voice', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'suggesting', 'one', 'would', 'earn', 'popularity', 'opera', 'singer', 'limitations', 'actress', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'least', 'sounded', 'operatic', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'found', 'performance', 'bland', 'overall', 'As', 'hard', 'tried', 'convey', 'desperation', 'yearning', 'rarely', 'felt', 'Rossum', 'truly', 'felt', 'emotions', 'herself', 'facial', 'expressions', 'hers', 'being', 'seduced', 'seem', 'more', 'calculated', 'spontaneous', 'only', 'actor', 'cast', 'who', 'real', 'impression', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'who', 'hams', 'up', 'impressively', 'Carlotta', 'overbearing', 'diva', 'Italian', 'accent', 'two', 'miles', 'wide', 'humorous', 'caricature', 'not', 'onscreen', 'very', 'long.In', 'short', 'only', 'value', 'visual', 'aural', 'glitz', 'genuine', 'emotional', 'substance', 'will', 'find', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'Otherwise', ""'d"", 'say', 'skip']",N/A

Some of the songs were familiar over the years especially The Music Of The Night.  But outside of that, I didn't even know what the story was, however I assumed it was similar to the novel and to the old Claude Rains 40 Universal movie, which I've seen.  In fact I saw the Hammer version too from 1963.  And the Argento version as well so I guess you can say I'm seen a few versions of this tale before.  But the story as told by Andrew Lloyd Webber has a few twists and turns I never heard before, especially the ""quasi Elephant Man"" background of the Phantom.  And the way that the Miranda Richardson character holds the secret to the Phantom's past, having known him when they were both kidsAnyhow the picture held us spellbound for over two hours, and at the end of the movie when the credit came on, ""Directed by Joel Schumacher,"" about half the audience stood and clapped, never saw that before in a movie!  And you should have heard the screams during the one portion when the Phantom loses his ask onstage (I am trying to word this to avoid spoilers).  A shriek ran throught the audience as we sat there stunned and overwhelmed with horror like a Julia Kristeva apothegm!  My wife thought Gerard Butler was so sexy she says she wants to see every film he's ever been in.All the actors were good.  Even Minnie Driver (and her song she sings over the credits at the end of the movie is delightful--I wonder if that could be her real voice?)Now somebody help me out here!  What is the story with Meg, the young daughter of Miranda Richardson who sorts of looks like Britney Spears when she was starting out.  Is Meg supposed to be in love with the Phantom?  Does she wind up with him?  Why does she take the mask?  Or is she the daughter of the Phantom?  The movie had a few loose ends but this is one that I've been trying to piece out, what is the truth about Meg?  And why doesn't she have a French name?  Or is Meg a French name?Anyway, I recommend this movie to all.  I went into it a skeptic, and I came out of it a total convert.  It's people like me who spread the word of mouth that makes a film a monster hit.  Hope it succeeds.  If you ask me, it should win the Oscar and sucks to The Aviator or whatever.

Emmy Rossum delievered a stunning performance as Chirstine who is charming, sweet, and innocent-- I can only hope to see more of her-especially on-stage. But, the best performance in my opinon came from Patrick Wilson who plays Chirstine's protector and lover he does a simply stunning job and I find myself falling in love with him each time I hear his beautiful voice. Gerard Butler in my opinon was a poor choice for the mysterious Phantom who takes control of Christine's mind- his voice didn't seem to fit the role despite the fact that he is the veteran stage performer in this movie.The newly added song is perfect for the feel of the movie and is beautifully sung by Minnie Driver in the end credits.

I never saw the Broadway productin of The Phantom of the Opera and I am not a fan of Joel Schumacher, the man who killed Batman.  I didn;t like Phone Booth and overall, I think he is a mediocre director.  In The Phantom of the Opera, Schumacher outdoes himself.  He faithfully follows Webber's play, but he also improves upon making the battle for Christine's soul in a major fight between good and evil and making his Phantom a person who is evil and clearly thinks he is above every one else.  Emmy Rossum is fantastic as Christine.  Her voice is lovely, but she is able to pull off the conflicted young woman with aplomb.  The scene where she sings in the theater for the first time is pure magic and the scene in the graveyard before the fight is heartbreaking.  Gerard Butler is a fine villain.  He makes the transition between sophisticated gentleman and psychopath at will.  The harshness in his voice contrasts well with Rossum's polished vocals.  Minnie Driver is outrageous as Collatta and Patrick Wilson is fine as Rauol.

So we knew not what to expect.  But at the very opening, as the long-dead chandelier rises to life, swinging in what seems like one endless arc, and scatters the colour of memories about as it flames back to life, and the theatre is washed in colour and majesty not seen in decades... we both knew this was going to be good.  And it was.When it comes to sets, scenery and cinematography, they spared no expense.  Every scene is drenched in rich detail.  At the risk of sounding the heretic, I must say that a movie version removes the limitations of space and time to set up the stage, and so has the upper hand in the scenery and sets department.  Some of these shots must have taken weeks to compose, and I'm glad they invested the time.The music is just wonderful.  I'd dare say that even if you are not a musical fan, if you are at least romantically inclined, you will LOVE this movie.  By the end of some songs, like, ""All I ask of you"" I'm restraining myself from singing the song out loud with them!The movie kind of departs from the setting of the original silent movie, in which the Phantom is actually quite hideous.  This Phantom is more ""mysterious"" than hideous.  But the attraction between him and Christine is pure, raw sensual.  I mean it borders on erotic it's so strong.  During ""Past the point of no return"" I'm sitting there with my wife, literally falling under the spell myself.  ""Yea... maybe she *should* be with this guy after all.  I mean, he knows how to make her move, and she definately responds to his touch...""  But that's the whole point.  She WAS influenced by him, and he did cast a strong spell, and he was very alluring.  The movie made it so real I was beginning to feel it myself.Definately worth seeing in a theatre if you can.

I am glad they didn't try to duplicate the stage show.  With a film, you can see the actors' faces and see the emotions.  It's more intimate.  They were wise to capitalize on this.  Gerard Butler is quite charismatic on the screen and it's easy to see how Christine might be torn between him and Raoul.  Emmy Rossum is marvelous!  What a presence she has on screen, especially for a person so young!  Her singing voice is beautiful with an innocent quality to it.  Patrick Wilson, who played Raoul, has a truly beautiful singing voice.  I appreciate that they made him more of a swashbuckling hero in the movie.I have noticed that a lot of people criticize this movie by the way it relates to the stage show.  I don't get this criticism, truly I do  not.  For one thing, Andrew Lloyd Webber himself was intimately involved with the making of this film.  He was there when the principal roles were cast.  ""Behind the Mask,"" a documentary featured in the extras on the 2nd disk, has interviews of him where he says that he wanted his Phantom to have a ""rock and roll"" sensibility to him.  With Gerard Butler, he got it!  Not only did Butler do a fine job with the singing, his acting was incredible! I don't think Michael Crawford, as lovely as his voice is, has the screen presence Butler has.  Films and Stage productions must be different by definition, and I think the filmmakers were wise to recognize this.  As ALW said in the interview, if you don't have the contrast between the ""dangerous"" Phantom and the lovely lyric tenor Raoul, you don't see why Christine might be attracted to the Phantom.  I must say I agree.",5,One of the best movies of 2004,1116115200,"05 15, 2005",2005,1730,"['Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'Joel', 'Schumaker', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'bringing', 'well', 'loved', 'musical', 'screen', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'duplicate', 'stage', 'show', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'actors', 'see', 'emotions', 'more', 'intimate', 'were', 'wise', 'capitalize', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'quite', 'charismatic', 'screen', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'Christine', 'might', 'be', 'torn', 'Raoul', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'marvelous', 'What', 'presence', 'screen', 'especially', 'person', 'so', 'young', 'singing', 'voice', 'beautiful', 'innocent', 'quality', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'who', 'played', 'Raoul', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'singing', 'voice', 'appreciate', 'made', 'more', 'swashbuckling', 'hero', 'movie.I', 'have', 'noticed', 'lot', 'people', 'criticize', 'movie', 'way', 'stage', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'criticism', 'truly', 'do', 'not', 'one', 'thing', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'was', 'intimately', 'involved', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'there', 'when', 'principal', 'roles', 'were', 'cast', 'Mask', 'documentary', 'featured', 'extras', '2nd', 'disk', 'interviews', 'where', 'wanted', 'Phantom', 'have', 'rock', 'roll', 'sensibility', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'got', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Butler', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'singing', 'acting', 'was', 'incredible', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'as', 'lovely', 'voice', 'screen', 'presence', 'Butler', 'Films', 'Stage', 'productions', 'must', 'be', 'different', 'definition', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'wise', 'recognize', 'ALW', 'said', 'interview', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'contrast', 'dangerous', 'Phantom', 'lovely', 'lyric', 'tenor', 'Raoul', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'Christine', 'might', 'be', 'attracted', 'Phantom', 'must', 'say', 'agree']",N/A
890151,AWJ4OO1GCEJ6V,B0007TKNI8,"K. Nish ""Wild Girl Yonder""","[1, 5]","I just watched this film and my title is the only way I can describe it.  I have seen the stage version 4 times, with Crawford, Guilliame and others playing in the starring role.  I saw Sarah Brightman and Steven Barton playing Christine and Raoul as well.  And while it isn't really fair to compare, it is done.Overall, I liked the movie and will probably see it at least 3x in the theatre.  It is eye candy with the black and white to full color memory, gorgeous sets and unbelievable costumes.  I have issues however with both the cinematography and the editing as far as the movie is concerned.  You can't do the movie half as a surreal dream and the rest of the memory scenes as realistic.  It just doesn't work.  There were times when I felt they should have cut to a different camera angle and once when we were staring up someones nostril for over 30 secs.  Distracting!As far as the actors, I LOVED everyone except the Phantom.  He hissed, he snarled, he growled and he sang that way as well-there was no vibratto to the voice.  In the first of the movie he just looked like a smooth psychopath in a mask, nothing different and I was sure he didn't have the range to carry the role.  Which makes a mental disconnect when the mask finally comes off and all of a sudden we discover that he has more than enough to explore the full depth of it. Almost as if he were being leashed with the mask on. It seems like artifice to me and it didn't work.The lack of vibratto is also distracting in Raoul and Christine's first songs.  For a while I wondered if it was just the lack of the big open theatre, but sure enough, this also shows up later in the film.  Again, a convention that didn't work for me.And while I read about this before seeing the movie, I really didn't think it would affect me as much as it did.  I truly believe it will blow the costuming Oscar for this film-but WHO IN THE WORLD decided to do Masquerade in tri-color?  As a historical backdrop, civilized society wore black and white to most functions, with the exception of a Masqued Ball, when it was open season.  On stage this was an unbelievable splash of color and much of the aria is given to talking about ""every mask a different shade, splash of gold, touch of puce, eye of blue....."" etc.  So that when the Phantom showed up in black and white and a mask, it is the ultimate irony because he is anything but civilized.  But in this film Masquerade the attendants are black, white and gold and the Phantom is the only color.  Again, WHY?And this is just a personal note of something that drove me nuts, but I have no idea why Christine Daae kept wondering around the theatre with Raoul in her underwear!  This is not the actions of a modest girl hoping to become a wife, but more in keeping with an Opera dancer auditioning for a different role.  At least Meg had on her tutu and corset cover, which is only semi-scandalous.As far as what I did like, Minnie Drive was Wonderful as Carlotta.  And I think I liked this Raoul better than Barton.  He had a youth and exuberence that he brought to the role which was enchanting.  A type of white knight quality of protector that is only found in the young.Again, I liked the film, but I can't figure out why certain choices where made.  They detracted from the film and kept it from being truly great.",4,Odd Choices,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,3328,"['just', 'watched', 'film', 'title', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'describe', 'have', 'seen', 'stage', 'version', '4', 'times', 'Crawford', 'Guilliame', 'others', 'playing', 'starring', 'role', 'saw', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Steven', 'Barton', 'playing', 'Christine', 'Raoul', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'really', 'fair', 'compare', 'done.Overall', 'liked', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'see', 'least', '3x', 'theatre', 'eye', 'candy', 'black', 'white', 'full', 'color', 'memory', 'gorgeous', 'sets', 'unbelievable', 'costumes', 'have', 'issues', 'however', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'as', 'far', 'movie', 'concerned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'movie', 'half', 'surreal', 'dream', 'rest', 'memory', 'scenes', 'realistic', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'cut', 'different', 'camera', 'angle', 'once', 'when', 'were', 'staring', 'up', 'someones', 'nostril', '30', 'secs', 'Distracting', 'As', 'far', 'actors', 'LOVED', 'everyone', 'Phantom', 'hissed', 'snarled', 'growled', 'sang', 'way', 'well-there', 'was', 'vibratto', 'voice', 'first', 'movie', 'just', 'looked', 'smooth', 'psychopath', 'mask', 'nothing', 'different', 'was', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'range', 'carry', 'role', 'Which', 'mental', 'disconnect', 'when', 'mask', 'finally', 'off', 'sudden', 'discover', 'more', 'enough', 'explore', 'full', 'depth', 'were', 'being', 'leashed', 'mask', 'artifice', 'did', ""n't"", 'work.The', 'lack', 'vibratto', 'also', 'distracting', 'Raoul', 'Christine', 'first', 'songs', 'while', 'wondered', 'was', 'just', 'lack', 'big', 'open', 'theatre', 'sure', 'enough', 'also', 'up', 'later', 'film', 'Again', 'convention', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'me.And', 'read', 'seeing', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'affect', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'truly', 'believe', 'will', 'blow', 'costuming', 'Oscar', 'film-but', 'WHO', 'IN', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'decided', 'do', 'Masquerade', 'tri-color', 'historical', 'backdrop', 'civilized', 'society', 'wore', 'black', 'white', 'most', 'functions', 'exception', 'Masqued', 'Ball', 'when', 'was', 'open', 'season', 'stage', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'splash', 'color', 'much', 'aria', 'given', 'talking', 'mask', 'different', 'shade', 'splash', 'gold', 'touch', 'puce', 'eye', 'blue', '..', 'etc', 'when', 'Phantom', 'showed', 'up', 'black', 'white', 'mask', 'ultimate', 'irony', 'anything', 'civilized', 'film', 'Masquerade', 'attendants', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'gold', 'Phantom', 'only', 'color', 'Again', 'WHY', 'just', 'personal', 'note', 'something', 'drove', 'nuts', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Christine', 'Daae', 'kept', 'wondering', 'theatre', 'Raoul', 'underwear', 'not', 'actions', 'modest', 'girl', 'hoping', 'become', 'wife', 'more', 'keeping', 'Opera', 'dancer', 'auditioning', 'different', 'role', 'least', 'Meg', 'had', 'tutu', 'corset', 'cover', 'only', 'semi-scandalous.As', 'far', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'Minnie', 'Drive', 'was', 'Wonderful', 'Carlotta', 'think', 'liked', 'Raoul', 'better', 'Barton', 'had', 'youth', 'exuberence', 'brought', 'role', 'was', 'enchanting', 'type', 'white', 'knight', 'quality', 'protector', 'only', 'found', 'young.Again', 'liked', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'certain', 'choices', 'where', 'made', 'detracted', 'film', 'kept', 'being', 'truly', 'great']",N/A

890153,A1E85KPLPYVW8E,B0007TKNI8,"Kolors ""Jimmy""","[1, 2]","With only being slightly familiar with the story of The Phantom of the Opera, I really didn't know what to expect from it when my girlfriend dragged me the theater to watch it a while back. My first experience watching The Phantom of the Opera was an extremely confusing one. First of all, I have never actually sat down through an entire musical in my life. As sad as that may seem to some of you, musicals just aren't in my taste. So it was rather hard to follow the dialect in this film because 95% of it is singing. I was immediately turned off when I realized that most of this film was singing. I had no idea it was based on a musical play by some guy named Andrew Lloyd Webber. I guess I'm not cultured enough to have known that at the time. But anyways, secondly, I couldn't believe Joel Schumacher had directed it. I've known Schumacher for doing films like Falling Down, Flatliners, 8mm, Batman Forever, all really good films, but all out of the realm I believed The Phantom of the Opera to be in for a director of films of those nature. So not being a musical film fan and being terribly confused by the director, I had no way of telling if The Phantom of the Opera was a good movie or not. I really could not seem to figure out if I liked or not. It SEEMED like a musical that would have cultured play attending fools who listen to Beethoven and stuff like that jumping up and down in their seats. It SEEMED like it was a good movie, but I wasn't sure for myself. I felt like a blind person critiquing a painting. To me, at first, The Phantom of the Opera seemed like a contrived boring and annoying piece of movie, but I wasn't sure if that was because it was actually was like that, or if that's how all musicals are and I just don't have the stomach for them. I left the theater in a blunder and vowed not to put myself through that again and told myself I would take a neutral stand on my opinion of the Phantom film.But this weekend The Phantom of the Opera creeped into house and for some odd reason I felt so compelled to watch it after I told myself that I'd never watch it again. It was so strange watching it again, almost like I was watching it again for the first time, only better. The music I found so annoying and the singing that was so hard to understand in the beginning, I found myself able to follow the storyline better through the music and singing this time around. After a while, the music and singing didn't even seem like music or singing at all, I was following it just I would normal dialogue in any other movie. I felt emotionally connected to the characters. I really enjoyed the photography and the sets more. Everything in this movie seemed so rich to me now, it's really hard to tell what happened, but for some reason I had the ability to get into this movie. Maybe I had matured since I saw it (doubtful) or maybe this is just one of those movies you need to give a second chance. I think I was able to get in to The Phantom of the Opera the second time around because I knew what more to expect.

890154,A2GPEV42IO41CI,B0007TKNI8,Kona,"[1, 1]","It is the 1870s, and living beneath the Paris opera house is a mad, disfigured, musical genius known as the Phantom (Gerard Butler).  Using often violent methods, he advances the career of Christine, a young, orphaned chorus girl(Emmy Rossum). Christine is grateful to her mysterious mentor, but the Phantom wants more than her gratitude.I love the magnificent musical score and opulent sets and wardrobe; the film is a visual masterpiece.  The story is, at turns, passionate, dangerous, and tender, and is well-directed. At age 16, Rossum is sweet and innocent and gives a good performance as the conflicted Christine, but I felt the other two leads are miscast.  For me, Butler's lisp and overbite are too prominent and distracting (since the rest of his face is covered) and he lacks the confidence and charisma needed to pull off the role. Also, his eventual unmasking reveals nothing worthy of horror.  As Christine's childhood sweetheart, Patrick Wilson  has a American accent that makes it impossible to believe he's a French nobleman and I didn't find him appealing at all.Fans of the show may overlook these quibbles, however, as the production is first-rate in every other way.  Minnie Driver's performance as the  diva is one of the highlights.

I have since seen the movie 4 times in the theater with different people each time and the reaction is the same.  And it is quite ironic that all the comments that I hear from other people as I have left the theater are very positive, which is in opposition of most of the reviews of newspapers, magazines, and other movie reviewers.I am very impressed with Emmy Rossum, who plays Christine.  She has a beautiful voice!  Though I love listening to Sarah Brightman's version, Emmy adds more drama/feeling in her voice and her voice is quite clear and more youthful sounding which I believe is quite fitting for the part.Gerard Butler,in my opinion, is very dynamic as the Phantom.  He adds a lot of depth to the character which is seen in his body motions,his facial expressions,his eyes, and of course heard in his voice.  He has a rougher, more raw voice than Michael Crawford, but it is very expressive and lovely in his own way.  I really enjoy his voice.Raoul is an excellent singer himself.  He's an attractive guy, but if there is any fault in this movie it is that the Phantom is too beautiful.  Gerard Butler is a fine specimen, so it is hard for me to believe that Christine goes with Raoul and not with the...I'm gonna say it....sexy phantom.Minnie Driver also is great!  She plays the role of La Carlotta.  she's hilarious and provides comic relief for the film.The costumes and background provide a lot of visuals that aid in the beauty of the film, but I have to say that the actors, their performances, accompanied of course with the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber are the key to the greatness of this movie.All in all, this movie is very passionate and feeling.

890157,A2RY3JWNMSREMD,B0007TKNI8,Kristina,"[3, 7]","I was very disappointed with this movie, even though I am a huge fan of Phantom of the Opera. Although I thought Webber did an honorable job of bringing this story from Broadway musical to live film, I think that they made the Phantom way too sexy. I mean, come on. The Phantom is not meant to be a sexy and attractive character. I really didn't care for Gerard Butler as the Phantom either. Do people really buy that this guy can sing? I also hate the Phantom's make up. It wasn't even scary! It wouldn't even have been frightening for people who had lived back in the 1800's, let alone today's society.I did, however, really like Emmy Rossum's performance as Christine Daee'. She had the role down flat. Emmy is very cute and has a great voice. She completely understood her charcter and how to deliver Christine Daee' onstage.Minnie Driver was very amusing as La Carlotta. I loved her wild costumes and she had some very good lines as well. I didn't really care for her new song ""Learn to be Lonely,"" which was only played during the credits, thank goodness. The song just didn't fit the original score by Webber and Rice.Miranda Richardson, who plays Madame Giry, was excellent. I love the back story that they came up with for Madam Giry and the Phantom. That answered a lot of questions for me. And whoever played Meg Giry was great as well. She's just very cute and makes a great Meg Giry.Patrick Wilson portrays the often-misunderstood Viscount de Changy. I thought that he did a marvellous job. Patrick and Emmy looked great beside each other and his voice really fit the character as well.Now, what I really love about the movie though is the artwork. The sets were stunning. I love how in the beginning everything was black and white, as though it was purposefully made to look like a bad home movie. Then, when the chandelier was brought up everything filled out with color and came back to life. That was definitely a great moment in the film in my book. The Phantom's labyrinth was also richly done and the Opera House is gorgeous.All in all, this wasn't a bad film. There are some moments that I loved and some additions that I thought totally worth seeing. I think in general most people will like it. I think I'm just picky.

Here's the scoop (And my background!): I was an English and Theater minor in college, I read Gaston LaRoux's original book, I saw Lloyd-Webber's musical many times, and I saw several different movie versions (Yes, even the one staring Freddy Kruger as the Phantom!).People, stop taking this movie so drastically seriously! It is a good movie. Fun to watch; I actually got teary eyed at the poor ""baby phantom"" in the circus cage. It is a plain old different story from the stage musical, movies, and book. The original stage version is different from the book: Erik was with his father in the book as a mason building the opera house; in the stage he sings of having a ""mask"" as his ""first unfeeling scrap of clothing.""Does that make the Musical hideous? Heck no! DRAMATIC license, people!People are complaining that it is not close enough to the Lloyd Webber stage version. Now, no one is Michael Crawford: he IS the Lloyd Webber version. But Gerry Butler is quite good as a younger, cuter, movie version that they created. I think they KNEW that they would never capture the magic that is on the stage 100% and made the movie a little ""different"" in order to make it satisfying. Perhaps the movie is even a bit more true to the Lloyd Webber score?People also complain that it is not closer to the book. Scarlett in ""Gone with the Wind"" had 3 kids, not 1 like the movie. Does that make it any worse? Nonsense! It's an OSCAR winner, for goodness sake.So here's the good things that should make you want to see the movie: It is a good story.

This angel turns out to be none other than the Phantom of the Opera (Gerard Butler), a disfigured musical genius who has been haunting the opera house for years, pestering the managers and the prima donna, Carlotta (Minnie Driver) and secretly falling in love with his student. When Christine's childhood sweetheart, Raoul (Patrick Wilson) shows up, the Phantom takes drastic measures to ensure that Christine will be his.The production features dazzling costumes and scenery. Strong performances are given by the cast, especially Patrick Wilson, Minnie Driver, and Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds (as the new managers, Mssrs. Andre and Firmin). Emmy Rossum, as the ingenue Christine, leaves much to be desired. Her voice is too underdeveloped to handle the role and she bounces between three different expressions thoughout the whole movie.The movie owes much to the performance of Gerard Butler, who faced heavy criticism while the movie was in release. In addition, far too much as been made of his attractive physical appearance. Both of these factors should be disregarded when watching this film. Prettiness aside, he is entirely believeable as a man who is consumed with self-loathing on one hand and total obsession on the other. His singing, though rougher than Michael Crawford's, nonetheless still charms and just adds to his decidedly unique portrayal.

In some ways, this film did wonderful justice to the famous stage show. In others, it could have done better.The LOOK of the film was fabulous, absolutely gorgeous beyond description. The costuming, the sets, all of it was beautiful. I was glad they kept the Andrew Lloyd Webber version of the Phantom's mask, only covering HALF the face, rather than the whole thing. But I was surprised at how non-repulsive the Phantom actually WAS. He's supposed to have these ghastly hideous features, but he really wasn't that bad, his scars were minor and not monstrous at all. It was a little anti-climactic. The Phantom himself was a little too attractive, too sexy, which was a little weird.I don't mind so much that Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford did not play in this film. However, I think that the voices they had were not as good as they could have found. The Phantom had a decent voice, but it wasn't dark like it should have been. Christine seemed to have some trouble reaching some of the higher notes, and her voice was simply too weak to be convincing as an opera singer. It was a nice voice, sweet and pretty, but unsupported, a voice that would never carry in an opera house. And while I didn't necessarily mind Minnie Driver's role as the prima donna, it didn't make any sense to have her play the part in the first place --- especially since she didn't even do her own singing. This is a popular enough show that it doesn't NEED a big name just for the sake of having a big name in the film. That almost seems to show a lack of faith in their own work, if they have to feature someone well-known to get people interested in seeing it. They should have used the person who actually did the singing voice.At least most of the music was in there. I was worried they would cut a lot of the good songs, but they kept it all in there, and most of it was pretty well-done, even if the voices COULD have been stronger.The most annoying thing for me, though, was the random flashes into the ""present,"" the black-and-white segments. The beginning and the end is fine, it's appropriate. But having them interspersed through the rest of the film was really distracting, and unnecessary. It brought the audience out of the real action of the story and didn't add anything to the plot. Didn't make sense.I certainly enjoyed the film, and it had a lot of good things about it. But I think they could have done a better job than they did. The next time I see ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" it will be on the stage.",3,Mixed Feelings,1120780800,"07 8, 2005",2005,2624,"['Admittedly', 'hard', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'used', 'stage', 'show', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'comparing', 'two', 'ways', 'film', 'did', 'wonderful', 'justice', 'famous', 'stage', 'show', 'others', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better.The', 'LOOK', 'film', 'was', 'fabulous', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'description', 'costuming', 'sets', 'was', 'beautiful', 'was', 'glad', 'kept', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'version', 'Phantom', 'mask', 'only', 'covering', 'HALF', 'face', 'rather', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'non-repulsive', 'Phantom', 'actually', 'WAS', 'supposed', 'have', 'ghastly', 'hideous', 'features', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'scars', 'were', 'minor', 'not', 'monstrous', 'was', 'little', 'anti-climactic', 'Phantom', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'attractive', 'too', 'sexy', 'was', 'little', 'weird.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'film', 'However', 'think', 'voices', 'had', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'Phantom', 'had', 'decent', 'voice', 'was', ""n't"", 'dark', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Christine', 'seemed', 'have', 'trouble', 'reaching', 'higher', 'notes', 'voice', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'weak', 'be', 'convincing', 'opera', 'singer', 'was', 'nice', 'voice', 'sweet', 'pretty', 'unsupported', 'voice', 'would', 'never', 'carry', 'opera', 'house', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mind', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'role', 'prima', 'donna', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'have', 'play', 'part', 'first', 'place', 'especially', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'own', 'singing', 'popular', 'enough', 'show', ""n't"", 'NEED', 'big', 'name', 'just', 'sake', 'having', 'big', 'name', 'film', 'almost', 'show', 'lack', 'faith', 'own', 'work', 'have', 'feature', 'someone', 'well-known', 'get', 'people', 'interested', 'seeing', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'person', 'who', 'actually', 'did', 'singing', 'voice.At', 'least', 'most', 'music', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'worried', 'would', 'cut', 'lot', 'good', 'songs', 'kept', 'there', 'most', 'was', 'pretty', 'well-done', 'even', 'voices', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'stronger.The', 'most', 'annoying', 'thing', 'though', 'was', 'random', 'present', 'black-and-white', 'segments', 'beginning', 'end', 'fine', 'appropriate', 'having', 'interspersed', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'distracting', 'unnecessary', 'brought', 'audience', 'real', 'action', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'plot', 'Did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.I', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'things', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'did', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'will', 'be', 'stage']",N/A
890164,AX2A8Q454K8L2,B0007TKNI8,Laura,"[5, 5]","I have always been a fan of the Phantom of the Opera and have listened to the CDs more times than I care to admit. When I heard that they were making the play into a movie, I have to admit that I was skeptical. After seeing the movie, my weariness has drastically changed. This movie takes the essence of the songs and transforms it beautifully onto the big screen. I do have a few specific points that I would like to comment on.Many reviewers have commented on Gerard Butler not being fit for the role of Phantom. Yes, he does have a deeper voice than Michael Crawford. I personally feel that it adds to the Phantom's mysteriousness and sensuality. He has a wonderful voice. If you need further convincing listen to him sing Music of the Night. No, he is not Michael Crawford . . . but would you all really want to see an older, weighty Phantom drooling over a youthful Christine??? He also is a wonderful actor. He brings a different light to the dark Phantom's character. Audiences pity, love and lust for him. He represents the dark desires that you only dream about and never speak of. Yet, amidst all of this he is a murderer. He balances it all out beautifully and has an amazing voice. Stop comparing him to Michael Crawford and you'll see it too.The character of Christine has also been criticized for being too young. Christine is supposed to be a mere chorus girl and ballet student. It wouldn't be right to have someone in their twenties pretending to be that young as other films have tried. Emmy Rossum also makes Christine a much fuller character. In the play, I thought Christine was a wishy-washy character who couldn't make a decision if her life depended on it. Now you can see how she is drawn to both men and truly does love them both. You can also understand why she trusts the Phantom so much. It's not because she's incapable, she believes all along it's her father's ghost. What girl wouldn't trust her father???The last person that is quite regularly criticized is Minnie Driver. No, she is not the voice of Carlotta. Did you expect her to be able to hit those notes because she felt like it? It takes a lot of professional training to do that. Minnie Driver does however have a good deal of training in acting which a professional vocalist would not. The character of Carlotta is a lot of the comic relief in this dark film. Minnie Driver manages to make audiences laugh without going ""over the top."" She is perfect for the role and brings out her character perfectly. I never used to like the song Prima Donna before. Now I listen to it #1 for the singing and #2 for the acting that is associated with the song. I don't think that the dubbed voice is such a bad thing. I'm sure all of the reviewers would have something to say if they heard Minnie Driver trying to hit those notes.Overall I think the film is wonderful. It's wonderfully acted and need I comment on Patrick Wilson's voice. Wow! The movie takes all of the wonderful things from the play and adapts it for the screen better than I thought possible. Michael Crawford was bound to get too old for the role. When you go see the play now, it's not going to be Michael Crawford playing the Phantom anymore. He did a great job in his youth, but I think it's only fair to give another great singer a chance.",5,Beautiful Transformation,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,3293,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'have', 'listened', 'CDs', 'more', 'times', 'care', 'admit', 'When', 'heard', 'were', 'making', 'play', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'skeptical', 'seeing', 'movie', 'weariness', 'drastically', 'changed', 'movie', 'essence', 'songs', 'transforms', 'beautifully', 'big', 'screen', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'specific', 'points', 'would', 'like', 'comment', 'on.Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'not', 'being', 'fit', 'role', 'Phantom', 'Yes', 'have', 'deeper', 'voice', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'personally', 'feel', 'Phantom', 'mysteriousness', 'sensuality', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'need', 'further', 'convincing', 'listen', 'sing', 'Music', 'Night', 'No', 'not', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'would', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'older', 'weighty', 'Phantom', 'drooling', 'youthful', 'Christine', 'also', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'different', 'light', 'dark', 'Phantom', 'character', 'Audiences', 'pity', 'love', 'lust', 'dark', 'only', 'dream', 'never', 'speak', 'murderer', 'out', 'beautifully', 'amazing', 'voice', 'Stop', 'comparing', 'Michael', 'Crawford', ""'ll"", 'see', 'too.The', 'character', 'Christine', 'also', 'been', 'criticized', 'being', 'too', 'young', 'Christine', 'supposed', 'be', 'mere', 'chorus', 'girl', 'ballet', 'student', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'right', 'have', 'someone', 'twenties', 'pretending', 'be', 'that', 'young', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'tried', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'also', 'Christine', 'much', 'fuller', 'character', 'play', 'thought', 'Christine', 'was', 'wishy-washy', 'character', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'decision', 'life', 'depended', 'Now', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'drawn', 'men', 'truly', 'love', 'can', 'also', 'understand', 'why', 'Phantom', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'incapable', 'all', 'father', 'ghost', 'What', 'girl', 'would', ""n't"", 'trust', 'father', 'last', 'person', 'quite', 'regularly', 'criticized', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'No', 'not', 'voice', 'Carlotta', 'Did', 'expect', 'be', 'able', 'hit', 'notes', 'felt', 'lot', 'professional', 'training', 'do', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'however', 'have', 'good', 'deal', 'training', 'acting', 'professional', 'vocalist', 'would', 'not', 'character', 'Carlotta', 'lot', 'comic', 'relief', 'dark', 'film', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'make', 'audiences', 'going', 'top', 'perfect', 'role', 'out', 'character', 'perfectly', 'never', 'used', 'song', 'Prima', 'Donna', 'Now', 'listen', '1', 'singing', '2', 'acting', 'associated', 'song', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'reviewers', 'would', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'heard', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'trying', 'hit', 'notes.Overall', 'think', 'film', 'wonderful', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'need', 'comment', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'voice', 'Wow', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'things', 'play', 'screen', 'better', 'thought', 'possible', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'was', 'bound', 'get', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'When', 'go', 'see', 'play', 'now', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'playing', 'Phantom', 'anymore', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'youth', 'think', 'only', 'fair', 'give', 'great', 'singer', 'chance']",N/A

I think that Micheal Crawford is a great Phantom, so before I get flamed let me state my reasons for liking the film so much.Visually, I don't think there are some things that could be done on stage that can be done in the film.  And on that note, let me say that Joel Shumaker is a great dark director.  Now, I can go into my review.Gerard Butler is an underestimated actor as it is, but when I saw him playing the Phantom I was immersed completely in the film.  The music, the actors, no matter how raw were amazing.  I think Gerard brought sensuality and passion to the phantom that just from the voice I can't hear with Micheal Crawford.  Emmy Rossum was closer to the age of Christine than Sarah Brightman was, which makes it even better in my opnion.  When the ages all match up for the role, when you haven't had too much in the way of experience, it fits so much better for the role of Christine.I can't even begin to sum up all of my favorite parts of the film, that would take too long, but I loved the opening scene, when it fades from black and white to color, I get chills every time I see it, and I have seen it twice, I plan to go see it more once it opens in my city so I dont have to drive 30 miles away to see it.  But let me just say that it is amazing...Beautiful and Dark, Passionate and Sexual, the voices are perfect...Past the Point of No Return is one of the most moving songs in the whole movie...When the two of them are entwined on the plank aboive the fire, their chemistry is out of this world.

890168,A19WRXQ7EG8QF5,B0007TKNI8,"L. Carol ""carolcecilia, D.V.""","[8, 9]","I have been looking forward to viewing the DVD to one of best movies I have seen in 2005. What sets this DVD apart is that its recordings are very, very well executed, even when played on my low fidelity system. Having the full subtitles to the lyrics is also fantastic for singing along and to relive a truly cathartic experience. Having said that, the bonus materials/making-of featurettes were, while informative, a bit of a 'cheat' as the producers decided to pay greater tribute to the original cast (of the London West End Musical) than the latest trio of Butler/Rossum/Wilson. Another disappointment was the lack of deleted scenes except for a Gerard Butler solo of ""Learn To Be Lonely"", the same song performed by Minnie Driver in the closing credits.As to the movie itself, I was skeptical as to how much value a movie rendition of one of my all-time favorite musicals could add. To my utter delight and astonishment, I walked out of the theatre unduly satisfied, rating the movie more highly than the musical. I had the opportunity of seeing ""Phantom"" on stage three times, once when I was still a poor student and was seated at the upper balcony, and later in life in the most pricey seats located in the Grand Stall and Dress Circle. Yet, none of these expensive seats offered the superior vantage points the movie could bring. The experience was synonymous to being given the best seats at any one moment in time in full view of the goings-on (no need for binoculars for a change!), allowing viewers to take in the immediacy of the hustle and bustle, songs and dances, romantic love triangle et al!Obviously, for the truly nitpicking, technicality like the leading cast's singing was perhaps, for the lack of a better word, ""sub-par"" to the renown vocal ranges of the original duo (Michael Crawford/Sarah Brightman). But it is unduly unfair to write-off the movie solely on account of this. The acting was moving and the rare occurrence of perfect on-screen chemistry between Emmy Rossum as sweet Christine and Gerard Bulter* as the enigmatic Phantom was a cinematic gem. Viewers are likely to welcome a meatier and more compassionate role donned by Miranda Richardson's Madame Giry, not least the casting of bitchy Carlotta. I was puzzled at first given that Minnie Driver was the only thespian in the cast whose singing voice was fully dubbed until the closing credits. However, my doubts were cleared as soon as I saw Driver's purposely over-the-top yet wonderfully show-stealing performance, not least giving viewers the acute impression of her enjoying every minute of enlivening her limited screen time!Having perused the scope of the movie, it became obvious why Andrew Lloyd Webber decided to make a movie extravaganza of the musical with Joel Schumacher since 1991. It was excellent direction and collaboration at that. The movie was never meant to be an inferior re-make of the musical, but one whose aim was to improve on the stage-play with a more thoroughly fleshed out screenplay amidst the plethora of action, weightier characterization of the supporting roles, not least greater substantiation of the many assumed knowledge unbeknownest to viewers in light of stage limitations, complete with lavish sets, costumes and cinemaphotography to sweep viewers off their feet!The movie worked as a great supplement and a must-see for fans of the musical, not to mention those, like myself, who have not had a chance to read the original novel by Gaston Leroux. The additional developments in the movie were already worth the price of the ticket - some 15 minutes of newly-written music backing scenes absent in the musical! I won't be a killjoy by revealing the unnecessary, but here's a teaser: what about how Phantom came to be? I was also impressed by the amount of labor and toil that went into making this movie far more visually gratifying than the musical. Webber/Schumacher & Co even managed to outdo the already vibrant set/costumes' design in the musical's ""Masquerade"" Act, accomplishing this feat by repackaging the scene in a glittery monochromatic affair, refreshingly adorning the costumes/sets in just black/white/gold/silver, except to single out Christine in her virginal pink outfit and Phantom in his killer red attire!And if the afore-mentioned didn't quite convince you to give the show a chance despite lukewarm reviews from critics, here's one to whet your appetite: while the musical never gave any concluding remarks as to what happened to Phantom, Christine and Raoul after they escaped from the underground labybrinth of the Paris Opera House, the movie provided a satisfactory wrap of the following: (i) if Christine & Raoul lived happily ever after and (ii) what became of Phantom following his mysterious disappearing act from the dark labyrinth of Opera Populaire - this epilogue alone was good enough justification to watch the movie.*As an aside: Seeing Gerard Butler's interview clips on the DVD reaffirms why this under-rated, latecomer to Hollywood is a rare breed and quickly gaining a following - what a great display of humility! Despite his not unsuccessful stint with a Scottish rock band, he humbly conveyed he had so much to learn from veteran singers like Rossum (trained to sing since age 7) and Patrick Wilson (a critically acclaimed broadway singer) and that he slogged really hard to tackle the huge singing part of Phantom. I look forward to catching more of Gerry Bulter in future...hopefully to see him succeed Pierce Brosnan in the much contested title role in the new James Bond series.",5,Great DVD to accompany this

Schumacher's crew and cast did an outstanding job bringing this Gothic masterpiece to film. Gerard Butler is a great Phantom - sexy, menacing, and he can sing. Yes, he sings in a deeper baritone and is no Michael Crawford. But Gerard wasn't trying to be as he's not a professional singer. I love Michael Crawford, but prefer Gerard's deeper rougher vocals especially on ""Music of the Night.""  Obviously, we all would have loved to see Brightman and Crawford reunited on film.  That would have been sheer perfection.  However, it wasn't meant to be. Now Emmy Rossum is delightful. Her singing is exquisite and that voice is simply lovely to hear. There is definite chemistry between Rossum and Butler. I like Patrick Wilson whom sings beautifully, but his acting is rather stilted. I wonder if Schumacher could have coaxed more from him. Minnie Driver is hilarious and over the top as the opera diva. I loved her. Miranda Richardson is a fantastic bonus to any film.

Modernized by the latest movie technology, this version is the best one yet. With stunning morphing scences at the beginning of the movie you will be hooked. In this movie the music is oprea style of course. But now it's mixed with rock which gives it a new aspect. With both Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber helping with the movie. I don't think anyone else could do a better job.-Side note- Now I was totally surprised on learning that Gerald Butler played as the Phantom. (From Laura Croft Cradle of Life.) And had no idea that he was able to sing. But I felt he did well as the phantom.I watched the version from 1991 with Burt Lancaster as the father (of the phantom) and theater owner.

It's a powerful moment, one which encapsulates the very essence of this venerable cinematic warhorse. What follows is every bit as sumptuous as the stage show, with a younger cast in familiar roles: Newcomer Rossum is an angelic Christine, beautiful and talented in equal measure, while Wilson shines as her lovestruck admirer, whose dalliance with Christine invites the Phantom's wrath, played with strength and conviction by Butler. Simon Callow and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds provide comic relief as the Opera's new owners, and there's strong support from Miranda Richardson (the Opera's ballet mistress, bound to the Phantom by more than mere coincidence), Minnie Driver (generously eccentric as the obstinate diva whose monstrous ego and limited talent prove to be her undoing), and veteran Murray Melvin as the frazzled orchestra conductor (a sublime, near-wordless performance).The film is a spectacle in all senses of the word, designed and photographed to glorious cinematic excess. Webber and Schumacher financed the production independently, so the finished product is true to their respective vision, but while the results are a feast for the senses, it's also compromised in unusual ways: Except for the chandelier sequence and an earlier scene in which the Phantom murders a nosy stagehand (Kevin McNally), Schumacher de-emphasizes the horrific elements of Gaston Leroux's original novel in favor of Gothic visuals (note the Cocteau homage during Christine's first visit to the Phantom's subterranean lair), and he's too quick to reveal the Phantom as a flesh-and-blood creature without any supernatural trappings, which undermines his potency. Those unfamiliar with the stage show may also bristle at the amount of dialogue which is SUNG rather than spoken, draining several crucial scenes of their dramatic urgency, especially during the film's final stretch, though the climactic pay-off is genuinely heartfelt. Romantic, resplendent, defiantly old-fashioned, this 'Phantom' overcomes its minor obstacles to emerge as a triumph in every department.",3,Visually stunning adaptation of the old literary warhorse,1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,2787,"['PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'UK/USA', '2004', 'color', 'sepia', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '2.39:1', 'Panavision', 'Theatrical', 'soundtracks', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '/', 'DTS', '/', 'SDDSFrance', '1870', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'House', 'haunted', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'who', 'young', 'opera', 'ing', 'eacute', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'enraged', 'when', 'love', 'handsome', 'nobleman', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', '.Joel', 'Schumacher', 'long-planned', 'adaptation', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'ultra-successful', 'stage', 'musical', 'greatest', 'set-piece', 'director', 'career', 'spine-tingling', 'shift', 'grainy', 'monochrome', 'saturated', 'color', 'timeframe', '1919', '1870', 'restoring', 'dilapidated', 'Opera', 'House', 'former', 'glory', 'swirl', 'visual', 'effects', 'trickery', 'powerful', 'moment', 'one', 'very', 'essence', 'venerable', 'cinematic', 'warhorse', 'What', 'bit', 'as', 'sumptuous', 'stage', 'show', 'younger', 'cast', 'familiar', 'roles', 'Newcomer', 'Rossum', 'angelic', 'Christine', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'equal', 'measure', 'Wilson', 'shines', 'lovestruck', 'admirer', 'dalliance', 'Christine', 'Phantom', 'wrath', 'played', 'strength', 'conviction', 'Butler', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'Opera', 'new', 'owners', 'strong', 'support', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Opera', 'ballet', 'mistress', 'bound', 'Phantom', 'more', 'mere', 'coincidence', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'generously', 'eccentric', 'obstinate', 'diva', 'monstrous', 'ego', 'limited', 'talent', 'prove', 'be', 'undoing', 'veteran', 'Murray', 'Melvin', 'frazzled', 'orchestra', 'conductor', 'sublime', 'near-wordless', 'performance', '.The', 'film', 'spectacle', 'senses', 'word', 'designed', 'photographed', 'glorious', 'cinematic', 'excess', 'Webber', 'Schumacher', 'financed', 'production', 'independently', 'finished', 'product', 'true', 'respective', 'vision', 'results', 'are', 'feast', 'senses', 'also', 'compromised', 'unusual', 'ways', 'chandelier', 'sequence', 'earlier', 'scene', 'Phantom', 'murders', 'nosy', 'stagehand', 'Kevin', 'McNally', 'Schumacher', 'horrific', 'elements', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', 'original', 'novel', 'favor', 'Gothic', 'visuals', 'note', 'Cocteau', 'homage', 'Christine', 'first', 'visit', 'Phantom', 'subterranean', 'lair', 'too', 'quick', 'reveal', 'Phantom', 'flesh-and-blood', 'creature', 'supernatural', 'trappings', 'potency', 'unfamiliar', 'stage', 'show', 'may', 'also', 'bristle', 'amount', 'dialogue', 'SUNG', 'rather', 'spoken', 'draining', 'several', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'dramatic', 'urgency', 'especially', 'film', 'final', 'stretch', 'climactic', 'pay-off', 'genuinely', 'heartfelt', 'Romantic', 'resplendent', 'defiantly', 'old-fashioned', ""'Phantom"", 'minor', 'obstacles', 'emerge', 'triumph', 'department']",N/A

I haven't seen any other version, but I have heard the soundtrack from the Broadway version, so I can compare a bit there.Here's what I think about the cast, stariting with Emmy.Emmy Rossum: Wonderful choice for Christine. It's amazing to think she was only sixteen when they filmed The Phantom. Her voice is of someone far beyond her years. I prefer her to Sarah Brightman though, because, even though she sounds as if she's had years more training and practice, she still has that young, innocent, sweet sound you need for a good Christine. And you can tell she really loves the Phantom, especially in The Point of No Return, and near the end, when she sings 'Pitiful creature of shadow, what kind of life have you known? God give me courage to show you, you are not alone' and kisses him.Gerard Butler: Great as the Phantom! He puts so much emotion into his voice, which I think Michael Crawfor lacks. I do think it is a bit strange that he's so young though (the Phantom is supposed to be older and uglier), but still, he gives an outstanding performance. It's really heartbraking to hear him at the end, when Christine and Raoul and in the boat rowing away, and he sings the line 'Christine, I love you' from All I Ask of You.Patrick Wilson: I seriously don't get why everyone hates Parick!!! I've read everything from his voice is wooden to he has bad facial expressions to his hair is too long. What is wrong with him???????? Patrick Wilson plays an excellent Raoul. He's everything the young suitor is supposed to be: handsome, confident, loving and protective of Christine, and seemingly pure good (you just can't really detect anything bad about him when he's sitting up on that grand white horse of his, or sacraficing himself for Christine, now, can you?). I think he has a great voice and my heart just melted when he sang All I Ask of You with Christine. That's my favorite song in the entire movie for sure. and why does everyone hate Raoul as a character, too? Being young, handsome, rich, and in love is not a crime. Yeah, he's whiny and babyish at times, but he loved Christine, didn't he? What's wrong with that? In the end it was Christine's descision - he didn't make her love him.Minnie Drive - Great as Carlotta. Even though her voice was dubbed (though she does sing the ending credits song, Learn to be Lonely), she has that perfect, cocky attitude Carlotta needs. Carlotta is really a good comic relief charcter. You just can't help but laught at her way-too-dramatic,over-the-top performances.Simon Callow and Ciarin Hinds - Perfect opera house managers! Just like Carlotta, they're comic relief. They're really funny in the beginning of the song Notes. Especially when they're reading one of the letters where the Phantom wrote 'Dear Firmin just a brief reminder, my salary has not been paid' they sound absolutely infuriated and practically spit the 'my salary has not been paid' part.I thought the ending of the movie was very interesting, too. It never truly ends. What happens to the Phantom is never really said, and I found it strange that they showed an aged Raoul going back to Christine's grave.Overall, I really love this movie and would definitely recommend it to any Phantom fans!",5,The Phantom is Phantastic!,1113177600,"04 11, 2005",2005,3244,"['Really', 'really', 'awesome', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'version', 'have', 'heard', 'soundtrack', 'Broadway', 'version', 'can', 'compare', 'bit', 'what', 'think', 'cast', 'stariting', 'Emmy.Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Wonderful', 'choice', 'Christine', 'amazing', 'think', 'was', 'only', 'sixteen', 'when', 'filmed', 'Phantom', 'voice', 'someone', 'far', 'years', 'prefer', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'even', 'had', 'years', 'more', 'training', 'practice', 'still', 'young', 'innocent', 'sweet', 'sound', 'need', 'good', 'Christine', 'can', 'tell', 'really', 'Phantom', 'especially', 'Point', 'No', 'Return', 'end', 'when', ""'Pitiful"", 'creature', 'shadow', 'what', 'kind', 'life', 'have', 'known', 'God', 'give', 'courage', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'kisses', 'him.Gerard', 'Butler', 'Great', 'Phantom', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'voice', 'think', 'Michael', 'Crawfor', 'do', 'think', 'bit', 'strange', 'so', 'young', 'Phantom', 'supposed', 'be', 'older', 'uglier', 'still', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'really', 'heartbraking', 'hear', 'end', 'when', 'Christine', 'Raoul', 'boat', 'rowing', 'away', 'line', ""'Christine"", 'love', 'Ask', 'You.Patrick', 'Wilson', 'seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'everyone', 'Parick', ""'ve"", 'read', 'everything', 'voice', 'wooden', 'bad', 'facial', 'expressions', 'hair', 'too', 'long', 'What', 'wrong', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'excellent', 'Raoul', 'everything', 'young', 'suitor', 'supposed', 'be', 'handsome', 'confident', 'loving', 'protective', 'Christine', 'seemingly', 'pure', 'good', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'detect', 'anything', 'bad', 'when', 'sitting', 'up', 'grand', 'white', 'horse', 'sacraficing', 'Christine', 'now', 'can', 'think', 'great', 'voice', 'heart', 'just', 'melted', 'when', 'sang', 'All', 'Ask', 'Christine', 'favorite', 'song', 'entire', 'movie', 'sure', 'why', 'everyone', 'hate', 'Raoul', 'character', 'too', 'Being', 'young', 'handsome', 'rich', 'love', 'not', 'crime', 'Yeah', 'whiny', 'babyish', 'times', 'loved', 'Christine', 'did', ""n't"", 'What', 'wrong', 'end', 'was', 'Christine', 'descision', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'love', 'him.Minnie', 'Drive', 'Great', 'Carlotta', 'Even', 'voice', 'was', 'dubbed', 'sing', 'ending', 'credits', 'song', 'Learn', 'be', 'Lonely', 'perfect', 'cocky', 'attitude', 'Carlotta', 'Carlotta', 'really', 'good', 'comic', 'relief', 'charcter', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laught', 'way-too-dramatic', 'over-the-top', 'performances.Simon', 'Callow', 'Ciarin', 'Hinds', 'Perfect', 'opera', 'house', 'managers', 'Just', 'Carlotta', ""'re"", 'comic', 'relief', ""'re"", 'really', 'funny', 'beginning', 'song', 'Notes', 'Especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'reading', 'one', 'letters', 'where', 'Phantom', 'wrote', ""'Dear"", 'Firmin', 'just', 'brief', 'reminder', 'salary', 'not', 'been', 'paid', 'sound', 'absolutely', 'infuriated', 'practically', 'spit', ""'my"", 'salary', 'not', 'been', 'paid', 'part.I', 'thought', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'too', 'never', 'truly', 'What', 'Phantom', 'never', 'really', 'said', 'found', 'showed', 'aged', 'Raoul', 'going', 'back', 'Christine', 'grave.Overall', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Phantom', 'fans']",N/A

I fell in love with it so I bought the original cast CD of it and naturally loved that as well (it may have something to do with Michael Crawford's voice;).Anyway, when I heard that Phantom was coming on to the big screen, I must admit that I was a bit skeptical at first.  I wasn't sure if a musical of this genre could make the transition from stage to screen.  I am so glad that I was proven wrong!!!I went to see the movie about 2 days after it premiered and let me just sum it up in one word: WOW.  The music, actors, scenery, costumes, everything was magnificent!  Gerard Butler (The Phantom) was excellent in his role.  I was not at all familiar with him before seeing this movie.  His emotions that he put into the role made me feel so bad for the Phantom!  There were times that I wanted Christine to end up with him!Emmy Rossum (Christine) was brilliant!  Sure, she's no Sarah Brightman, but she is most definitely a rising star.  It is very hard to believe that she was only 16 years old when they filmed the movie.  She has a voice of, well, an angel!  And to top it off, she is absolutely gorgeous.Patrick Wilson (Raoul) was amazing as well.  I had no idea that he had come from the stage originally.  His voice was truly amazing, as was his acting.The supporting cast was amazing as well.  Minnie Driver is the perfect Carlotta.  She just fit into the role so well and I loved her accent!  She was indeed a great 'Primma Donna.'  Miranda Richardson (Madame Giry) did a wonderful job as the very mysterious woman who somehow knew the Phantom, but kept it to herself, until she told Raoul about how she met him.  Yet she was still amazing.Overall, I give this movie a 10/10.  Kudos to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher who made a wonderful team.  Minnie Driver's song Learn to be Lonely was terrific.  Thank you, ALW, for turning such a wonderful play into an incredible movie.If you are a fan of musicals, especially of Andrew Lloyd Webber's, I highly recommend you rent and/or buy this DVD today!

I laughed at the one-star reviews and agreed with some things said, while disagreeing with a lot.Let me start by saying I am a Phan. A huge Phan, and not of the musical alone. I started with the books! Books being the original and unsurpassed and the wonderful Phantom by Susan Kay. Before I fell in love with the music and before I even knew there was going to be a movie, I loved those books and Erik, and I hated Raoul and I hated Christine even more. Then, I discovered the musical, somewhat accidentally, when my mom bought a copy of The Best of Michael Crawford. I heard Music of the Night and knew I would forever love the musical as well. I have not seen the stage version yet, I'll be seeing it in a few months. Now, onto the movie.First, the sets and costumes. I loved both because there were so garish, opulent and excessive. This was the opera! The costumes were supposed to be extravagant and colorful, so I can see why they were cast like that. My only complaint was that not a single scene could pass when you weren't assaulted with Emmy Rossum's cleavage. The boys must have loved it. =) And I HATED the dress for Think of Me!  Is the opera Hannibal or Cinderella? =KOkay, now the music in general. Yes, I agree, Butler is not the best singer ever. BUT his voice is masculine and raspy and veryveryvery sexy, like I would imagine the Phantom's voice being. Rossum's voice wasn't as good as Christine should have been, but it did reflect how she was feeling pretty well. Raoul...Oh, Wilson. His voice is GORGEOUS. It's the reason I am buying the soundtrack.Okay, about Butler. Gerard Butler is a gorgeous man in his prime, an actor to the core and not a singer, in the prime of his life trying to play a grumpy old aging genius. In the movie, he looks about 35, 40 at the VERY oldest. Admittedly, he couldn't sing as well as Erik should have nor was he old enough or ugly enough, but come on. The screen has its priced, and he brought the passion and sorrow of Erik to the screen well. BE A LITTLE FORGIVING. He did a good job and you know it.Ah, now Christine. Emmy Rossum can sing, that is a fact. But I didn't like her! I hated Christine naturally, but Rossum is not a fantastic actress. During the whole movie, I always thought, 'Heh. She's a crackhead.' cause that's what she looked like. One emotion: Totally smashed.Raoul. Oh, Patrick Wilson is gorgeous and can sing and was as pathetic as Raoul but a bit more likable. He was fine as the role.Now, changes they made. Moving the chandelier crash, changing outfits, changing sets, changing events. It could make a diehard Phan mad, but trust me, I am one and it didn't bother me. You people act like a movie is supposed to be the Holy Grail of entertainment. Yes, some things were laughable. Yes, the M15M parody was HILARIOUS. But the movie was GOOD. No matter what you say. Admit it. It was interesting and you felt sorry for Erik. Come on. You know you loved it.Anyway. In conclusion. I am a diehard Phan, and I loved the movie. It got 4 stars because I hated Rossum's total lack of emotion. She deserves an Award for Most Superior Cleavage Showing Crackhead. Nothing more. And DANG was Gerard gorgeous as heck. The movie was entertaining and sad. So there. BAM.*ching goes the ugly monkey box*",4,Gorgeous.

890187,A1CROFPEPYNIZK,B0007TKNI8,LKayH,"[5, 5]","I just saw it last night, and I loved it just as much as the stage musical, which I saw more than once.  Better still, this one I can see a couple more times without being out $60 a pop!POTO (Phantom Of the Opera) has always gotten mixed reviews. It lacks the snob appeal that attracts the kind of people who usually enjoy staged musicals and operas, so right off, a big part of the core audience turns up its nose.  This show is really more for the average person, someone who likes tunes that haunt the mind, a sexy story, and a bit of a thrill, and who is willing to let down the hypercritical guard and just enjoy the ride.Emily Rossum's voice is quite stunning - the role requires an incredible range, and she not only had that, but she was able to go from this floaty, ingenue voice to a throaty seductress.  I was a little put off by the way they lit her up so she kind of glowed in the dark in one scene - this girl is so pretty on her own I don't think she needs the help.I thought Gerard Butler, the guy who played Phantom, was an excellent choice.  I had hoped they'd get this made sooner so Crawford could do it, but at 62, much as I love the guy's voice and his rendering of this character, he's not right for the part anymore.  Phantom should be much older than Christine, but not three times her age.  At thirty-something, Butler's Phantom is old enough to be her father, which works with her mindset, but still young enough to be a possible romantic interest.  What drives the tragic aspect of this is that there is the possibility of a romance, there is that spark of attraction, but it's always just out of his reach.  Butler's voice isn't nearly as nice as Michael Crawford's, but he made up for it in other ways. With the mask and wig, this guy is so gorgeous that you gotta wonder what red-blooded woman could possibly prefer Raoul to him (and Raoul is pretty appealing!). And Butler brought some nuances to the part that I liked.  His portrayal is darker, and you see a little more of the madness, which helps the viewer to understand Christine's choices.I liked this Raoul a lot better too.  I can't put my finger on what's different this time, but it seems like Wilson's version is more fully developed, more substantial.  In the stage show Raoul seemed pretty shallow, and thus I kind of disliked Christine for falling for him so quickly.  And this guy's voice is just awesome!Also Minnie Driver simply steals the show as the Prima Donna - I don't recall liking the stage versions as much either. She is the only person whose voice is dubbed - the real singer, Margaret Preece, has a brief appearance in one of the Operas.There is one legitimate grumble about this show.  The script has some major weak points, places where, without giving anything away, it's hard to understand what the good guys are thinking walking into an obvious trap.

890192,AN94YI3URSAII,B0007TKNI8,Lostgirl,"[7, 13]","I'm a fan from way back. I've noticed that most reviews compare the cast of this film with this Original London Cast Rercording (the most popular recording of the show). This bothers me for several reasons: I think things should be based on their own merit and comparing this to one recording ignore the hundreds of other performers who have played these roles. It also ignores the fact that film and stage are different mediums for which different things are appropriate.So what does that mean for this film and this cast? Well I hate to say it but Gerard Butler knocks a star off my rating. He is very probably the worst Phantom I've ever seen/heard. Oh what this film could have been with a different leading man! The story dictates that the Phantom is two things: deformed and a supernaturally brilliant singer. Why the young, good looking yet vocally challenged Butler was cast is beyond me. Andrew Lloyd Webber says in the DVD extras that he liked the ""rock n' roll"" edge that Butler's voice had. Well, I say you can find good singers with the same ""edge"". Butler not only has a weak voice and poor control of it, he also tries to express emotion by alternating volumes: he yells and whispers to indicate anger and sadness. His notes are  kept as short as possible and when he has to hold one he sounds as if he's on the point of breaking. If he were in an amateur production or singing karaoke I'd say he's alright. Here he falls amazingly short. As a character he is not the darkly romantic figure or the genius tormented by madness: he's a boring guy who lives in a basement and whines when he doesn't get his way. And the Phantom is not meant to be young or physically attractive- he represents a twisted father figure to Christine.  It's more of a challenge for an actor to draw sympathy from an audience based on his voice, his small emotional gestures, and in spite of hideous makeup. Butler's voice isn't enought to draw emotion on it's own. His looks are marred by a sunburn and his age is young enough to make him more of a romantic prospect for Christine in the eyes of the audience. I give Butler credit for making the attempt but his Phantom is the weak point in this production.People claim that Raoul is a boring character which I understand to a certain extent but he's a necessary one. He loves Christine in a healthy way while the Phantom's love is a dangerous obsession. He's stable where the Phantom isn't. Vocally Patrick Wilson is everything that Gerard Butler is not.  He sings with a strong, polished tenor voice that's well suited to his character: a handsome young nobleman. Physically he is well suited to his role (though I could have lived without the Fabio inspired hairdo).At 16 Emmy Rossum was a full 10 years younger than most stage Christines when she took on the role. Vocally speaking that's a lot, and she sounds young. Her voice is breathy and with a few more years of training it would have been much stronger on the higher notes. While it might not get by on stage it's just right for film: it has a pure, sweet sound that's suited to the character. Rossum allows it to grow with the film. In her opening sequence ""Think of Me"" it's soft but as the character goes though emotional trials her voice gains it's footing and some more strength. It takes on a haunting quality in the mournful ballad ""Wishing You Where Somehow Here Again"" and shows some rich darker colors in the title song and the ""Point of No Return"". Rossum is also a good actress: she's been criticized for using too few facial expressions but I felt that she conveyed what she had to when she had to (how many facial expressions are meant to be employed when one's character is hypnotized?). Her Christine has an innocent, melancholy allure.As for the direction  it's alternately wonderful and absurd. I loved Joel Shumaker's visual references to Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, and his reimagining of The Point of No Return which is quite different from the stage version. But he seems too intent on making the film ""sexy"" by putting the women in lowcut dresses and casting a sexy but utterly inappropriate Phantom. The story, the music and the lyrics have a dark sensuality but Schumaker underestimates the intelligence of his audience by beating them over the head with it. Also he seems unsure of what to do with his camera during solos. In ""Think of Me"" we watch Christine standing still onstage, in ""Music of the Night"" we watch the Phantom lead Christine aimlessly around his lair and in ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" we see Christine walk through a cemetary. I can't help but think all 3 could have been more interesting in more able hands.If I could give this 3 and 1/2 stars I would but as it is I have to subtract one star due to Gerard Butler's performance and another for Schumaker's overbearing direction (though if I could I'd only take way 1/2 a star for that)",3,Flawed but still worth the price,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,4897,"[""'m"",

Gerald Butler is miscast, can't sing and his ""hideous"" disfigurement resembles little more than a moderate case of acne on one cheek. His makeup also changes from shot to shot.  Rossum is beautiful but she sleepwalks through the part and her voice is sometimes screechy.  Inexplicably, the beautiful and strategically important disguises worn by the Phantom in the stage play (the Lon-Chaney-inspired skeleton costume at the masquerade ball and the monk-like, identity-concealing robe during ""The Point of No Return"" sequence) are not used in the film.  Butler employs none of the stealthy, graceful moves associated with this musical phantom (he just tosses his cape around stupidly) and even the legendary music seems wan and listless much of the time.  I've waited for this movie for more than 15 years.  What a total disappointment.  This piece of overblown cinematic junk just wasn't worth screwing Michael Crawford out of a chance at film immortality.  And, if not Crawford, what about Antonio Banderas who was supposed to have been signed to play the phantom?  He would have been terrific.  Even John Travolta, who was interested in the role, would have been vastly superior to Butler.  The casting of Butler is eerily reminiscent of the disastrous casting of George Lazenby in the role of James Bond a few decades ago.  In fact, Butler even looks like Lazenby.

Once on Broadway when it opened and the second time when the Broadway show was first taken on tour. Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote this as a stage musical that just happens to be set in an opera house. It is not, and never was, meant to be classified as an opera.He wrote this musical with the thought of his then wife Sarah Brightman in mind. And it is one of the reason she is brilliant on stage as Christine. It is regretful that the movie took so long to arrange production that they could not keep the original cast. It was truly our loss. Yet there was a pleasent suprise in the casting of Emmy Rossum as Christine Daae. And Patrick Wilson did well as Raoul.This movie does a very good job of translating from stage to screen. Some of the score has been changed, and there was no reason for it. And because he could, the director added some background that is contrary to the story and some scenes that take way from the mystery. But the movie is still worth owning if you like Broadway musicals. And even though I am not giving it five stars, most will want to see it more then once.The premise of the movie is that the Phantom lives beneath the Paris Opera and terrorizes those who work there. And he demands that Christine is the star of their productions. But when she turns her back on the phantom's advances and her lover Raoul starts to interfere, the Phantom does all he can to take his perceived need for revenge and to try and capture the love of Christine.

I saw the Broadway tour of ""Phantom of the Opera"" a few years ago and it has been my favorite musical since. I love it more than Cats, 42nd Street, West Side Story, Les Miserables, Miss Saigon...you name it. Its romanticism and beautiful songs just blew me away.I was then somewhat hesitant to see the film version, fearing that it would not live up to my expectations. A little over two hours later and I found myself crying over the Phantom (Gerard Butler) and his love for the young Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) as she decides between him or the nobleman Raoul (Patrick Wilson).In short, I love this movie! It was everything I had hoped it to be and more. The story is faithful to the stage version but it also gives the audience a closer look into the lives of the three main characters. The art direction, sets and costumes are resplendent and breath-taking. And the songs are brought to life superbly by the talented cast of young newcomers (Rossum, Wilson) and film veterans (Miranda Richardson, Ciaran Hinds, Simon Callow).I know many would argue that Michael Crawford was a superb Phantom...that is, except for me.  I always felt that Crawford's voice was too high-pitched and not manly enough. To me, Gerard Butler is more effective Phantom. Apart from being incredibly handsome (under that make-up), tall and well built, he also has this rough and raspy voice that is very masculine and full of passion. He IS the Phantom! Emmy Rossum has a hauntingly beautiful voice and has an innocence and sweetness that fits perfectly for Christine.  Her voice gives me goosebumps! Patrick Wilson's romantic voice contrasts well with that of the Phantom's. After all, one is supposed to be a nobleman and the romantic hero while the other is dark, mysterious and brooding (like the misunderstood Quasimodo of ""Hunchback of the Notre Dame."") But even without the singing, Gerard Butler turns in a memorable and passionate performance as the Phantom and you really do feel for him in the end. If there was one fault to this film, for me, it would be Minnie Driver's Carlotta. She was so over the top that I sometimes found her grating.All in all, however, I walked out of the theater wanting to see ""Phantom of the Opera"" again and again (I've now seen it twice and counting). I couldn't get the music out of my head and have since purchased the CD.  I can't wait for the dvd to come out so I can watch it over and over. I highly recommend it to fans of the stage version, music lovers and incurable romantics everywhere.  And if you loved the songs, be sure to pick up the equally superb soundtrack. This phantom will haunt you long after you've left the movie theater....and I have gladly fallen under its spell.

There is a shadow( as Jung would call it) or a phantom in us all.  It is no accident that the phantom captures  Christine and takes her [not so unwillingly ] to the subterraean depths.  Good and evil are prominent themes and the mixture thereof.  Only Raoul seems completely pure and good riding his white horse to rescue his true love from the clutches of her other love and his dark rival - the angel of music and the night.I had never read a review and now I am glad of that. It was not the stage musical nor was it supposed to be.  The film performances were excellent - all of them.  They stand alone.I thought the switching back and forth from B/W to color for present and past very effective. There was a certain mystery in that because it was easy to assume that the older woman who nodded at the elderly Raoul in the auction scene might have been an older Christine.  I actually thought it was until the very end.  Now I know it was Madame Gidy's daughter who had a small but significant role in the story.And being an incurable romantic I love a good love story.  All of the really great love stories are tragic ones like Gone with the Wind and Out of Africa,  And of course - the pain and anquish of unrequited love, the horror of the distortion of a soul as well as a face, the poignancy, the innocence, the irony, the pathos all of which eats at your heart and brings back your sweetest and darkest memories.  And, yes, takes your breath away.Music beyond my dreams especially the opening organ which fills all space.  Comedic parts adding much to the otherwise somber plot.

I must say I was a little skeptical at first of how good the music would be compared to Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford. But I think the actors have lived up to their standard. I was extremely impressed with young Emmy Rossum as Christine Daae. Not only is she the right age for the part. A young chorus girl who suddenly has this beautiful voice. Although I enjoyed Sarah Brightman's original Christine, Emmy Rossum was delightful. As a teenager, she has such a beautiful clear voice that is much better than most of the vocal performance majors I know. As a child, she was a part of the children's opera chorus and has obviously had extensive vocal training. She can clear Christine's very extensive vocal range with absolutely no problem.Her voice is so pure that it reflects the pure innocent Christine she portrays on screen. Not only that, but she makes a beautiful Christine and is wonderfully cast opposite Gerard Butler's sneaky,devious, Phantom. I must say I was impressed with Gerard Butler's voice as well. His baritone is wonderfully rich and makes the melodies just as expressive as Michael Crawford's tenor. The cinematography is beautiful, for the film looks like a giant stage play. The colors are bright and vivacious and dark an mysterious. The costumes are beautiful, although I was disappointed at the scaling down of the Phantom's red death costume at the masquerade ball.

As an avid fan of Gaston Leroux's work, I was a bit apprehensive regarding this version. I don't think I have ever been happier to be so utterly wrong! Patrick Watson (Raoul) is a delightful lyrical tenor and makes a great romantic lead, while Emmy Rossum is the definitive Christine (sorry Ms. Brightman, I adore you but Rossum was perfectly cast), she conveys the perfect mix of purity, youth and innocence and comes of age right before our eyes. Brilliant. But my main appreciation has to go to Gerard Butler (the Phantom), who makes us feel his pain very keenly. You empathize with him big time. I was totally blown away by his ability to convey so much emotion while signing. Whoever made the final decision to cast him instead of a trained singer deserves all my admiration. It was a gutsy move, but a very brilliant one. He delivered every single note to perfection in terms of emotion and of vocal performance. He creates the perfect contrast with Watson and Rossum (intense and passionate compared to lyrical and romantic). &quot;The Point Of No Return&quot; is a particularly poignant number.

890210,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0007TKNI8,Mark Baker,"[2, 8]","There is a legend surrounding the old opera house in Paris.  The story goes that some creature lives downstairs demanding things of its owner.  They must pay him rent and star his protegee, Christine.  But as the Phantom is finally showing himself to Christine, she is falling for another man.  And the new owners think they don't have to listen to the Phantom.  These events will force the Phantom to take action and his true nature to be seen by all.I've only seen the stage play once, so I went into this movie with very little expectations and no baggage.  I was very impressed.  There is a jaw dropping scene as we first move from the ""modern"" era black and white to the color setting of the story.  The costumes and sets are fantastic, bring the story to life in a way not possible on stage.  Yes, events from the play occur in different orders, but over all, the story is still preserved.  The music, including the new song, is still outstanding.So what's my complaint?  It's the same one I have with the stage version.  The Phantom is made out to be sympathetic.  This is even truer here as we see his past as a little boy.  The problem is he's an evil man whose true nature comes out the more people stand up to him.  I realize I'm alone in not enjoying this glorification.  At least he does realize how bad his behavior has been near the end.Overall, this is a wonderful musical brought to life beautifully on screen.

890220,AW24ODXPY9CMI,B0007TKNI8,"M. DETWILER ""fairval4""","[8, 10]","The Phantom of the Opera is a beautiful movie.  From the beginning auction sequence that pulls you in to the last scene at Christine's grave, you don't want this movie to end.  I have always been a fan of the music and when I saw the trailer for the movie on TV before Christmas, I was eagerly awaiting this version.  I have to say I was a little disappointed in the lack of publicity for the movie.  I believe the studio must have spent the advertising money on Million Dollar Baby, but that's another story.It is rare in a movie to find that all the characters click and are likable.  For me that happened in Pirates of the Caribbean and it happened big time in POTO.  I thought all the characters were great.  Emmy Rossum has taken a lot of criticism for being sort of blank and having a deer in the headlights look.  I think she was just reacting as most women would when in the presence of Gerard Butler as the Phantom.  He seems to elicit a jaw dropping reaction in most women who have seen the movie.  I think Christine and the Phantom had a tremendous amount of chemistry together and you can see why she was really torn and had such a hard time deciding between Raoul and Erik.  Emmy Rossum's voice was just perfect for this role and she was very pleasant to listen to. (both in the movie and on the soundtrack).  Gerard Butler is an actor who can sing and I think he did a great job.  You could see every emotion the Phantom was feeling and really sympathised with him at the end. I wanted to stand up and say, ""The End"", after the kiss.  I almost thought Christine was coming to her senses and staying with him when she came back to give him her ring.  Silly girl.  I think his Phantom will become the standard all future Phantoms are measured by.  For me, he was a much more intense, passionate Phantom than others in that role.  He was the object of everyone's attention, whether he was onscreen or not.Patrick Wilson did a great job as Raoul, which is pretty much a go-nowhere role.  He has a lovely voice and ""Say You Love Me"" was one of the prettiest songs in the movie.  I really didn't like his hair, though!The supporting actors were outstanding.  Miranda Richardson and Jennifer Ellison looked alike and were believable as mother and daughter.  Miranda R. really displayed anguish over the fate of the little boy she had rescued and the man she had protected.  Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow nearly stole the show as the ""two fools"" who ran the Phantom's theatre.  I loved the maestro and his little ""You're fired"" and ""Bravo"".  It was nice to see the woman who dubbed Minnie Driver's voice, especially in Il Muto.This brings me to Minnie Driver and what I feel was an outstanding job.  She took an over-the-hill diva and embued her with likability even while she was a pain.  She was a pleasure to watch.  I especially liked her trying to hit Christine with her mask in ""Masquerade"".  I am disappointed that Ms. Driver will not be singing ""Learn to Be Lonely"" at the Oscars.  Do we really need Beyonce to sing another song???This movie has generated a lot of fan reaction and will probably give several of the actors (particularly GB, who has Dear Frankie coming out shortly) a career boost.  Most people who have liked it have seen it multiple times and non-music people are even listening to the soundtrack.  It wasn't all the critic's cup of tea, but a lot of people have found real pleasure in this lovely movie.That DVD can't get here soon enough.  I wish there were more than just 2 discs, though!  How about 4 or 5??

890223,A1UYNO24EXETXE,B0007TKNI8,M. G ORELL,"[3, 4]","Yes, I know the last exclamation mark is a 1This film has taken its place among my top 3 favorite movies, the first 2 being The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the first Pirates of the Carribean movie (they're making a sequel).First, let's talk about the music. The music is brought to the grand scale that Andrew Lloyd Webber had always dreamed of, now that it is being played by a full orchestra and not a pit band.The production design is extraordinary. I was rooting for the art department to win the Oscar for Best Art Direction. The grand scale of the stage show has been elevated to new heights.The treatment of the show itself is excellent. I loved the added touches of backstory and action and mystery. I personally preferred the sword fight in the cemetary because it works better on film than what actually happens on stage (the Phantom throws fireballs.) I also love how Schumacher gave the characters of Madame Giry and Joseph Buquet so much more to do than in the stage version. Frankly, they're just throwaway characters in the stage version but in the movie, we realize what Buquet is all about and we get to see that Madame Giry had a more vital role to play in the Phantom's life.Now for the cast:Emmy Rossum has the voice of an angel and is perfect for the part. She's the right age and has a young, crystalline voice.Gerard Butler as the Phantom. I don't agree that his singing voice is the best in the world. I know he's not really a trained singer but they could have trained him just a tad harder. Then again, Schumacher did not want a pretty voice for the Phantom. So, I forgive him. To tell the truth, his voice isn't that bad.Patrick Wilson has vocal chords made of gold, which is only right since he has done Broadway. He is perfect as the dashing, romantic, swashbuckling, and somewhat wimpy Raoul.Minnie Driver is hysterical as La Carlotta (I 'ATE MY 'AT!!!!)It's a pity that she's not really an opera singer.Miranda Richardson has an ok singing voice. She also puts on a convincing French accent. I've noticed that Madame Giry is normally the only member of the cast who has to do a French accent. She's less of a throwaway in the movie than in the stage version and more of a driving force. We see that she truly cares about Meg and Christine. So when the new managers are checking the two out, she's like, ""Don't even think about it!""Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds (pronounced KEE-ran HINDS; long I) are hysterical as the two managers (this never happened in the junk business; scrap metal!)I feel that Simon Callow's singing voice rivals Ciaran Hinds by far.Jennifer Ellison is a little delight as Meg Giry. And she's the first Meg I've ever heard who can sing. She's so petite and adorable that I thought Kristen Chenoweth was playing the part!Victor McGuire as Piangi is wonderfully hammy and henpecked. He has a wonderfully exaggerated tenor which gets crappy in all the right places. (Sad to return to find the la-a-a-and we love).I still don't understand why that midget was there all the time.Kevin McNally as Buquet. Well, he's better than the stage Buquet, who was a total throwaway character. At least he has more to do (like trying to catch the Ballet Girls getting dressed)The makeup on the Phantom was somewhat of a let down. It looked more like he had an encounter with acid as a young child. Then again, in the movie, it's never established that he was deformed from birth, so that may be what happened.The guy who played Monsuier Reyer was also funny (UNDERSTUDY!? There is no understudy for La Carlotta!)Just for the record, the horse in the title song is a homage to the original novel. The Phantom takes Christine to his lair on a horse.And now the special features:The featurette on the history of the musical was really cool. I especially liked the film clips of the Sydmonton production, the current production in England and clips from the music videos (the British DVD has the full, unedited music videos. Lucky dogs! Oh, well, they've had this show and Andrew Lloyd Webber longer.)The deleted song, No One Would Listen, is lovely even if it is really the first draft of Learn to Be Lonely.It's an awesome film and if the upcoming movie versions of Rent, The Producers, and Dreamgirls once again kill the movie musical which has barely been resurrected by Chicago and Moulin Rouge, this will be a reminder that this generation had its share of movie musicals. What can I say? I'm a sucker for movie musicals. I even liked Man of La Mancha.",5,LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,4492,"['Yes', 'know', 'last', 'exclamation', 'mark', '1This', 'film', 'taken', 'place', 'top', '3', 'favorite', 'movies', 'first', '2', 'being', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'first', 'Pirates', 'Carribean', 'movie', ""'re"", 'making', 'sequel', '.First', 'let', 'talk', 'music', 'music', 'brought', 'grand', 'scale', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'had', 'always', 'dreamed', 'now', 'being', 'played', 'full', 'orchestra', 'not', 'pit', 'band.The', 'production', 'design', 'extraordinary', 'was', 'rooting', 'art', 'department', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Art', 'Direction', 'grand', 'scale', 'stage', 'show', 'been', 'elevated', 'new', 'heights.The', 'treatment', 'show', 'excellent', 'loved', 'added', 'touches', 'backstory', 'action', 'mystery', 'personally', 'preferred', 'sword', 'fight', 'cemetary', 'better', 'film', 'what', 'actually', 'stage', 'Phantom', 'fireballs', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'Schumacher', 'gave', 'characters', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'Joseph', 'Buquet', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'stage', 'version', 'Frankly', ""'re"", 'just', 'throwaway', 'characters', 'stage', 'version', 'movie', 'realize', 'what', 'Buquet', 'get', 'see', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'had', 'more', 'vital', 'role', 'play', 'Phantom', 'life.Now', 'cast', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'voice', 'angel', 'perfect', 'part', 'right', 'age', 'young', 'crystalline', 'voice.Gerard', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'singing', 'voice', 'best', 'world', 'know', 'not', 'really', 'trained', 'singer', 'could', 'have', 'trained', 'just', 'tad', 'harder', 'Then', 'again', 'Schumacher', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'pretty', 'voice', 'Phantom', 'So', 'forgive', 'tell', 'truth', 'voice', ""n't"", 'bad.Patrick', 'Wilson', 'vocal', 'chords', 'made', 'gold', 'only', 'right', 'done', 'Broadway', 'perfect', 'dashing', 'romantic', 'swashbuckling', 'somewhat', 'wimpy', 'Raoul.Minnie', 'Driver', 'hysterical', 'La', 'Carlotta', ""'ATE"", 'MY', ""'AT"", 'pity', 'not', 'really', 'opera', 'singer.Miranda', 'Richardson', 'ok', 'singing', 'voice', 'also', 'convincing', 'French', 'accent', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'normally', 'only', 'member', 'cast', 'who', 'do', 'French', 'accent', 'less', 'throwaway', 'movie', 'stage', 'version', 'more', 'driving', 'force', 'see', 'truly', 'Meg', 'Christine', 'So', 'when', 'new', 'managers', 'are', 'checking', 'two', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'pronounced', 'KEE-ran', 'HINDS', 'long', 'are', 'hysterical', 'two', 'managers', 'never', 'happened', 'junk', 'business', 'metal', 'feel', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'singing', 'voice', 'rivals', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'far.Jennifer', 'Ellison', 'little', 'delight', 'Meg', 'Giry', 'first', 'Meg', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'who', 'can', 'sing', 'so', 'petite', 'adorable', 'thought', 'Kristen', 'Chenoweth', 'was', 'playing', 'part', 'Victor', 'McGuire', 'Piangi', 'wonderfully', 'hammy', 'henpecked', 'wonderfully', 'exaggerated', 'tenor', 'crappy', 'right', 'places', 'Sad', 'return', 'find', 'la-a-a-and', 'love', '.I', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'midget', 'was', 'there', 'time.Kevin', 'McNally', 'Buquet', 'Well', 'better', 'stage', 'Buquet', 'who', 'was', 'total', 'throwaway', 'character', 'least', 'more', 'do', 'like', 'trying', 'catch', 'Ballet', 'Girls', 'getting', 'dressed', 'makeup', 'Phantom', 'was', 'somewhat', 'let', 'down', 'looked', 'more', 'had', 'encounter', 'acid', 'young', 'child', 'Then', 'again', 'movie', 'never', 'established', 'was', 'deformed', 'birth', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'happened.The', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Monsuier', 'Reyer', 'was', 'also', 'funny', 'UNDERSTUDY', 'understudy', 'La', 'Carlotta', 'Just', 'record', 'horse', 'title', 'song', 'homage', 'original', 'novel', 'Phantom', 'Christine', 'lair', 'horse.And', 'now', 'special', 'features', 'featurette', 'history', 'musical', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'especially', 'liked', 'film', 'clips', 'Sydmonton', 'production', 'current', 'production', 'England', 'clips', 'music', 'videos', 'British', 'DVD', 'full', 'unedited', 'music', 'videos', 'Lucky', 'dogs', 'Oh', 'well', ""'ve"", 'had', 'show', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'longer', 'deleted', 'song', 'One', 'Would', 'Listen', 'lovely', 'even', 'really', 'first', 'draft', 'Learn', 'Be', 'Lonely.It', 'awesome', 'film', 'upcoming', 'movie', 'versions', 'Rent', 'Producers', 'Dreamgirls', 'once', 'again', 'kill', 'movie', 'musical', 'barely', 'been', 'resurrected', 'Chicago', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'will', 'be', 'reminder', 'generation', 'had', 'share', 'movie', 'musicals', 'What', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'movie', 'musicals', 'even', 'liked', 'Man', 'La', 'Mancha']",N/A
890224,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0007TKNI8,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[6, 10]","Based upon the French novel ""Le Fantme de L'Op&eacute;ra"" by author Gaston Leroux (1868-1927), the highly successful Broadway musical writer/composer Andrew Lloyd Webber transformed the novel into the highly successful musical ""The Phantom of the Opera"" in 1988.  Other well-known Broadway musicals that he has composed include ""Cats"" (1983), ""Evita"" (1980), ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" (1972) and ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" (1982).  Of these, both ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""Evita"" were adapted to big screen films in 1973 and 1996 respectively.  In 2004, Andrew Lloyd Weber took it upon himself to produce the film adaptation of his masterful live musical ""The Phantom of Opera"".  With elaborate costumes and the same appealing music, the film earned three Oscar nominations for ""Best Art Direction"", ""Best Cinematography"" and ""Best Original Song"".Directed by Joel Schumacher (who co-wrote the screenplay with Weber), the film version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" uses a film technique that was first used in the 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz"": the film begins in the black-and-white early twentieth century present (present for the film), then uses color to show the events of the past at the ill-fated Parisian opera house.  A young, disfigured boy (Chris Overton) had been rescued from a travelling carnival by a girl (Laura Hounsom) who worked and lived in a Parisian opera house. She hides the boy in the opera house where they each grow into adulthood, but unlike her, the grown-up Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson), he remained isolated from the rest of society.  Though very intelligent, his fears of how people will view his facial disfigurement forces him to become the secretive ""phantom"" (Gerard Butler) of the opera.  Living in the opera house encouraged a strong love of music and performance within him.  Unfortunately, he became obsessed with the notion that the opera house was his personal possession and frightened its owners (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as ""Firmin"" and Simon Callow as ""Andre"") to do his bidding.  This included forcing them to use the lesser-known performer Christine (Emmy Rossum) in place of the well-known, but egocentric diva Carlotta (Minnie Driver).  The phantom loved Christine, but she also had another suitor in Raoul (Patrick Wilson).With its elaborate sets, costumes and cinematography, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is indeed visually impressive.  Musically, the film suffers in part due to the casting of Gerard Butler whose singing is often flat and periodically struggles.  Also, as a character, the film suffers because Gerard Butler as the phantom should appear at least as old as Madame Giri (who is probably around age 50), but instead appears to be in his thirties.  This was done no doubt to make him appear more appealing to Christine (who is about 20), but in reality, he should appear to be about 25 to 30 years older than her, not 15 years.  As a live musical with impressive, live, three-dimensional special effects to dazzle audiences, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" was quite the experience; but as a two-dimensional film, the impact of those same special effects is diminished.  Consequently, with an estimated budget of $60-million, it is not surprising that the film grossed somewhat less than that in U.S. theaters at just over $51-million after showing for nearly 6 months.  As a film, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" demonstrates that a live show cannot always be adapted well to film.  My overall rating for the film is 3.5 out of 5 stars, rounded to 4 stars.",4,"Visually Impressive, But Not As Good as Stage Performance",1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,3532,"['Based', 'French', 'novel', 'Le', 'Fantme', 'de', ""L'Op"", 'eacute', 'ra', 'author', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', '1868-1927', 'highly', 'successful', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'writer/composer', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'transformed', 'novel', 'highly', 'successful', 'musical', 'Phantom', 'Opera', '1988', 'Other', 'well-known', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'composed', 'include', 'Cats', '1983', 'Evita', '1980', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', '1972', 'Joseph', 'Amazing', 'Technicolor', 'Dreamcoat', '1982', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'Evita', 'were', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'films', '1973', '1996', 'respectively', '2004', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Weber', 'took', 'produce', 'film', 'adaptation', 'masterful', 'live', 'musical', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'elaborate', 'costumes', 'same', 'appealing', 'music', 'film', 'earned', 'three', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Art', 'Direction', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Best', 'Original', 'Song', '.Directed', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Weber', 'film', 'version', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'film', 'technique', 'was', 'first', 'used', '1939', 'film', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'film', 'black-and-white', 'early', 'twentieth', 'century', 'present', 'present', 'film', 'then', 'color', 'show', 'events', 'past', 'ill-fated', 'Parisian', 'opera', 'house', 'young', 'disfigured', 'boy', 'Chris', 'Overton', 'had', 'been', 'rescued', 'travelling', 'carnival', 'girl', 'Laura', 'Hounsom', 'who', 'worked', 'lived', 'Parisian', 'opera', 'house', 'boy', 'opera', 'house', 'where', 'grow', 'adulthood', 'grown-up', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'remained', 'isolated', 'rest', 'society', 'very', 'intelligent', 'fears', 'how', 'people', 'will', 'view', 'facial', 'disfigurement', 'forces', 'become', 'secretive', 'phantom', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'opera', 'Living', 'opera', 'house', 'encouraged', 'strong', 'love', 'music', 'performance', 'Unfortunately', 'became', 'obsessed', 'notion', 'opera', 'house', 'was', 'personal', 'possession', 'frightened', 'owners', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Firmin', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Andre', 'do', 'bidding', 'included', 'forcing', 'use', 'lesser-known', 'performer', 'Christine', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'place', 'well-known', 'egocentric', 'diva', 'Carlotta', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'phantom', 'loved', 'Christine', 'also', 'had', 'suitor', 'Raoul', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', '.With', 'elaborate', 'sets', 'costumes', 'cinematography', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'indeed', 'visually', 'impressive', 'Musically', 'film', 'suffers', 'part', 'due', 'casting', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'singing', 'often', 'flat', 'periodically', 'struggles', 'Also', 'character', 'film', 'suffers', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'phantom', 'should', 'appear', 'least', 'as', 'old', 'Madame', 'Giri', 'who', 'probably', 'around', 'age', '50', 'instead', 'be', 'thirties', 'was', 'done', 'doubt', 'make', 'appear', 'more', 'appealing', 'Christine', 'who', '20', 'reality', 'should', 'appear', 'be', 'about', '25', '30', 'years', 'older', 'not', '15', 'years', 'live', 'musical', 'impressive', 'live', 'three-dimensional', 'special', 'effects', 'dazzle', 'audiences', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'was', 'quite', 'experience', 'two-dimensional', 'film', 'impact', 'same', 'special', 'effects', 'diminished', 'Consequently', 'estimated', 'budget', '60-million', 'not', 'surprising', 'film', 'grossed', 'somewhat', 'less', 'U.S.', 'theaters', 'just', '51-million', 'showing', 'nearly', '6', 'months', 'film', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'live', 'show', 'can', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'adapted', 'well', 'film', 'overall', 'rating', 'film', '3.5', '5', 'stars', 'rounded', '4', 'stars']",N/A

890228,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0007TKNI8,Michael Butts,"[5, 8]","Other than CHICAGO, movie musicals have not been abundant in the last ten years or so.  THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a joyous, breathtakingly beautiful film featuring some of Andrew Lloyd Webber's most beautiful songs (Music of the Night and All I Ask of You at the top), dazzling sets and costumes, artistic flair, and performances of superior quality.  More a love story than a horror story, THE PHANTOM sweeps onto the screen in lush colors and amazing cinematography.  Joel Schumacher, mostly known for his action thrillers, shows a deep respect for his material and takes his relatively unknown cast through the motions in glorious style.  Gerard Butler (Dracula 2000, Lara Croft Tomb Raider, Dear Frankie, Reign of Fire) is a superb Phantom.  Having to overcome the stigma of being the man who took Michael Crawford's role, Butler oozes romantic obsession, tortured self-deprecation and a swashbuckling persona.  While his vocal prowess is indeed limited, he sings with emotion and a tenderness combined with madness that is marvelous.  Emmy Rossum (Mystic River) was 16 when she filmed this movie and she is glorious.  Aside from her stunning beauty, she evokes the innocence of Christine and sings like a nightingale.  Patrick Wilson, a two time Tony nominee, is fine as the heroic Raoul, the young man who wins Christine's heart.  Their duet of All I Ask of You is dazzling.  Rounding out the cast are Minnie Driver as the over the top Carlotta, as mentioned the only performer who was dubbed musically; Miranda Richardson is perfect as the savior of the Phantom in his early years; and Simon Callow (Four Weddings and a Funeral) and Ciaran Hinds (Veronica Guerin) are superb as the two ""scarp metal"" magnates who buy the Opera house.  The film has a plethora of haunting scenes; artificial snow has never looked more gorgeous; and the graveyard scene is eloquently beautiful.THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is high class entertainment, and in time I feel it will receive more critical acclaim as it is viewed on its own merits and not compared to the stage play that gave its birth.",5,MUSIC OF THE NIGHT,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,2084,"['Other', 'CHICAGO', 'movie', 'musicals', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'abundant', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'so', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'joyous', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'featuring', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'most', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'Music', 'Night', 'All', 'Ask', 'top', 'dazzling', 'sets', 'costumes', 'artistic', 'flair', 'performances', 'superior', 'quality', 'More', 'love', 'story', 'horror', 'story', 'THE', 'PHANTOM', 'screen', 'lush', 'colors', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'mostly', 'known', 'action', 'thrillers', 'deep', 'respect', 'material', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'cast', 'motions', 'glorious', 'style', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Dracula', '2000', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'Dear', 'Frankie', 'Reign', 'Fire', 'superb', 'Phantom', 'Having', 'overcome', 'stigma', 'being', 'man', 'who', 'took', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'role', 'Butler', 'romantic', 'obsession', 'tortured', 'self-deprecation', 'swashbuckling', 'persona', 'vocal', 'prowess', 'indeed', 'limited', 'emotion', 'tenderness', 'combined', 'madness', 'marvelous', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Mystic', 'River', 'was', '16', 'when', 'filmed', 'movie', 'glorious', 'Aside', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'innocence', 'Christine', 'sings', 'nightingale', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'two', 'time', 'Tony', 'nominee', 'fine', 'heroic', 'Raoul', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Christine', 'heart', 'duet', 'All', 'Ask', 'dazzling', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'top', 'Carlotta', 'mentioned', 'only', 'performer', 'who', 'was', 'dubbed', 'musically', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'perfect', 'savior', 'Phantom', 'early', 'years', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'are', 'superb', 'two', 'scarp', 'metal', 'magnates', 'who', 'buy', 'Opera', 'house', 'film', 'plethora', 'haunting', 'scenes', 'artificial', 'snow', 'never', 'looked', 'more', 'gorgeous', 'graveyard', 'scene', 'eloquently', 'beautiful.THE', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'high', 'class', 'entertainment', 'time', 'feel', 'will', 'receive', 'more', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'viewed', 'own', 'merits', 'not', 'compared', 'stage', 'play', 'gave', 'birth']",N/A
890229,AEG3I82BVE2ZK,B0007TKNI8,"Michael Cornett ""Madman""","[8, 10]","Of course, I'm a little prejudiced, since I think the stage musical is problematic.  On the plus side, it's got a rich, tuneful score, but on the negative, I find the lyrics to be often sappy and insipid.Nevertheless, I sat down and watched the film version.To put it in a nutshell, a big issue I have with the whole treatment here is that ALW and Joel Schumacher take Gaston Leroux's penny-dreadful gothicism and filter it through the sensibilities of a Harlequin romance novel.Emmy Rossum is, I think, one of the best casting choices in this film.  Her youth makes Christine's gullibility and naivite believable, and her voice is simply superb.  Her performance keeps Christine from seeming too much like a flighty drip.  But Gerard Butler is disastrously miscast as the Phantom, and his Erik has got to be one of the most woefully misconceived characterizations that I've seen in years.  All through the movie we hear about how hideous he is.  Even Christine sings, ""Distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face.""  And yet, when unmasked, we have an extremely handsome man with a small bumpy patch on his face that merely looks like an unpleasant skin condition.  The Phantom's unmasking is supposed to produce shock, horror, and pity...but in this film, the only emotion I felt was the desire to slip him the name of a good dermatologist.  The ball was totally dropped there, folks, and the one of the story's big climaxes was anticlimactic.  (Various wags dubbed Butler ""The Fashionably Scarred Stud of the Opera"" which is pretty dead-on...)Unfortunately, Butler's singing wasn't up to the demands of the role, and he was certainly no match for Rossum's Christine.Another problem is that the film alternates between lavishness and paucity.  The ""Masquerade"" number felt underpopulated, just a few people standing around a room watching a masked fop ""vogue.""  It was a golden opportunity to cram the screen with dancing couples, like Lubitsch's ""The Merry Widow"" or even the original Lon Chaney ""Phantom.""  Instead, a major number ends up feeling like a throwaway.  There's lavish, gorgeous sets galore, but sometimes they're just not handled right.To its credit, there are some very nice numbers; ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" is a standout.  The sets and costumes are great.  But the supporting cast ranges from the workmanlike to the wooden to the hammy.  Shifting the story from the real Palais Garnier (the setting of the original novel, and the ALW musical, from what I remember) to a fictitious opera house is puzzling, as the Palais Garnier was very much one of the stars of the original story.  And a shift in time periods serves no purpose.Ultimately, it just doesn't gel.  I've heard they downplayed the Phantom's ugliness to avoid grossing out audiences, but that was a colossal mistake, as the Phantom's ugliness is one of the major elements that drives the story, and robs Christine's eventual kiss of any drama or sense of sacrifice.  (At the very least they should have rewritten some of the lyrics and dialog so they weren't always talking about how hideous he was...when he wasn't.  And a flashback scene to a young Erik being kept in a cage and mocked for his ""deformities"" is almost insanely idiotic when the extremely minor nature of his problem is revealed; people of that time would see far worse on the streets, what with skin diseases and war injuries in a time before prosthetics.)  This is a very highly romanticized version of the story, probably done less to satisfy fans of the Leroux Phantom story and more to satisfy the ""Phans"" who want Christine to choose the Phantom over Raoul.  (Even though the Phantom is a demented, deformed mass murderer and arsonist who used, manipulated, and decieved her for a long time, regularly threatens and berates her, wallows unceasingly in self-pity and blames everything on his ugliness, demands more love and devotion than any human being can give, menaces the people she cares about, is insanely obsessive, masquerades as her dead father in order to manipulate her further, demands complete and utter control of her, and can offer her nothing in the way of a real life or career...I guess these folks view Christine as unbelievably stupid and self-destructive and think that's romantic...)",2,Ill-conceived and uneven,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,4269,"['course', ""'m"", 'little', 'prejudiced', 'think', 'stage', 'musical', 'problematic', 'plus', 'side', 'got', 'rich', 'tuneful', 'score', 'negative', 'find', 'lyrics', 'be', 'often', 'sappy', 'insipid.Nevertheless', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'film', 'version.To', 'put', 'nutshell', 'big', 'issue', 'have', 'whole', 'treatment', 'here', 'ALW', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'take', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', 'penny-dreadful', 'gothicism', 'filter', 'sensibilities', 'Harlequin', 'romance', 'novel.Emmy', 'Rossum', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'casting', 'choices', 'film', 'youth', 'Christine', 'gullibility', 'naivite', 'believable', 'voice', 'simply', 'superb', 'performance', 'keeps', 'Christine', 'seeming', 'too', 'much', 'flighty', 'drip', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'disastrously', 'miscast', 'Phantom', 'Erik', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'woefully', 'misconceived', 'characterizations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'movie', 'hear', 'how', 'hideous', 'Even', 'Christine', 'sings', 'Distorted', 'deformed', 'was', 'hardly', 'face', 'yet', 'when', 'unmasked', 'have', 'extremely', 'handsome', 'man', 'small', 'bumpy', 'patch', 'face', 'merely', 'unpleasant', 'skin', 'condition', 'Phantom', 'unmasking', 'supposed', 'produce', 'shock', 'horror', 'pity', 'film', 'only', 'emotion', 'felt', 'was', 'desire', 'slip', 'name', 'good', 'dermatologist', 'ball', 'was', 'totally', 'dropped', 'there', 'folks', 'one', 'story', 'big', 'climaxes', 'was', 'anticlimactic', 'Various', 'wags', 'dubbed', 'Butler', 'Fashionably', 'Scarred', 'Stud', 'Opera', 'pretty', 'dead-on', 'Unfortunately', 'Butler', 'singing', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'demands', 'role', 'was', 'certainly', 'no', 'match', 'Rossum', 'Christine.Another', 'problem', 'film', 'lavishness', 'paucity', 'Masquerade', 'number', 'felt', 'underpopulated', 'just', 'few', 'people', 'standing', 'room', 'watching', 'masked', 'fop', 'vogue', 'was', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'cram', 'screen', 'dancing', 'couples', 'Lubitsch', 'Merry', 'Widow', 'even', 'original', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Phantom', 'Instead', 'major', 'number', 'up', 'feeling', 'throwaway', 'lavish', 'gorgeous', 'sets', 'galore', 'sometimes', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'handled', 'right.To', 'credit', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'numbers', 'Were', 'Somehow', 'Here', 'Again', 'standout', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'workmanlike', 'wooden', 'hammy', 'Shifting', 'story', 'real', 'Palais', 'Garnier', 'setting', 'original', 'novel', 'ALW', 'musical', 'what', 'remember', 'fictitious', 'opera', 'house', 'puzzling', 'Palais', 'Garnier', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'stars', 'original', 'story', 'shift', 'time', 'periods', 'purpose.Ultimately', 'just', ""n't"", 'gel', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'downplayed', 'Phantom', 'ugliness', 'avoid', 'grossing', 'out', 'audiences', 'was', 'colossal', 'mistake', 'Phantom', 'ugliness', 'one', 'major', 'elements', 'story', 'robs', 'Christine', 'eventual', 'kiss', 'drama', 'sense', 'sacrifice', 'very', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'rewritten', 'lyrics', 'dialog', 'were', ""n't"", 'always', 'talking', 'how', 'hideous', 'was', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'flashback', 'scene', 'young', 'Erik', 'being', 'kept', 'cage', 'mocked', 'deformities', 'almost', 'insanely', 'idiotic', 'when', 'extremely', 'minor', 'nature', 'problem', 'revealed', 'people', 'time', 'would', 'see', 'far', 'worse', 'streets', 'what', 'skin', 'diseases', 'war', 'injuries', 'time', 'prosthetics', 'very', 'highly', 'romanticized', 'version', 'story', 'probably', 'done', 'less', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'Leroux', 'Phantom', 'story', 'more', 'satisfy', 'Phans', 'who', 'want', 'Christine', 'choose', 'Phantom', 'Raoul', 'Even', 'Phantom', 'demented', 'deformed', 'mass', 'murderer', 'arsonist', 'who', 'used', 'manipulated', 'decieved', 'long', 'time', 'regularly', 'threatens', 'unceasingly', 'self-pity', 'everything', 'ugliness', 'more', 'love', 'devotion', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'give', 'people', 'insanely', 'obsessive', 'masquerades', 'dead', 'father', 'order', 'manipulate', 'further', 'complete', 'utter', 'control', 'can', 'offer', 'nothing', 'way', 'real', 'life', 'career', 'guess', 'folks', 'view', 'Christine', 'unbelievably', 'stupid', 'self-destructive', 'think', 'romantic']",N/A
890230,A1D69VSI3ZV9QW,B0007TKNI8,Michael J. Lira,"[41, 64]","So far, I've seen nothing but good reviews of this film. Sorry, but this isn't that kind of review. Stop reading now if you liked it, because I was absolutley appaled.I must say, that when I first heard about the film, I was both delighted and apprehensive. I was first introduced to Phantom of the Opera 7 years ago when my sister took me to a performance in San Francisco. I saw it again in London in July. After seeing it again, I was amped to see how it would translate to film. Then, a friend lent me the soundtrack, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It's also the reason I've put off seeing it until now. The first thing I've noticed is how much of the story has been changed and added to. For one, Madame Giry is not at the auction in the original performance, and it is Raoul who buys most of the items for sale. Though, I did like how they did the transition from the ""Present"" to the past. Another thing that was altered was the introduction of the new owners and Carlotta's departure. Raoul was never at that first meeting in the play.Another major change was the end of act 1. The chandelier was supposed to fall after the curtain falls on Il Muto (after Christine returns to perform the lead), being the biggest of the Phantom's crimes, and his attempt at forcing the owners and cast into compliance. The falling chandelier is delayed until the end, and doesn't give the same feeling. And the intro of act 2 is bad. The song ""Masquerade"" is written to reflect the costumes of the attendee's. The lyrics go: ""Flash of mauve / Splash of puce / Fool and king / Ghoul and goose / Green and black / Queen and priest / Trace of rouge / Face of beast"" and, ""Grinning yellows, spinning reds"". But, I ask you, where is all the color?? The only color seems to be from the opera's crew behinds the scenes! All the masqueraders wear variations on Black, White, and Gold! What kind of masquerade is monotone?! It the fact that many of the attendees had faces painted to resemble the Phantom seemed a bit forced. In the script for the play, it says that Christine is traded among dance partners who resemble in some way the Phantom, but never does it say they blatantly have his face! Also, what about the Phantom in that scene? His entrance isn't more than the lights dimming and a few flashbulbs instead of a grand performance as it should be for him. One thing that disappointed me was how they re-wrote the Phantom's past. Madame Giry discovered him when Meg was very young, not she herself. She's the one who freed him, he never escaped anything.As for the acting... Well, to borrow the Phantom's phrasing, it was ""a lamentable mess!"" Emmy Rossum's peformance was decent in some parts, but lacking in others. She seems much to young to fill the shoes of Christine. And Gerard Butler as the Phantom... not a great choice. For one, the Phantom is meant to be physically revolting, yet he looks like he just had some 2nd degree burns and they healed quite well.Honestly, much of the film was too contrived and forced. No one should waste their time or money on this drivel. If you want a love story, find something less gag-worthy or go see the stage performance.",1,"A ""Phantom"" Travesty",1115251200,"05 5, 2005",2005,3173,"['So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'nothing', 'good', 'reviews', 'film', 'Sorry', ""n't"", 'kind', 'review', 'Stop', 'reading', 'now', 'liked', 'was', 'absolutley', 'appaled.I', 'must', 'say', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'was', 'delighted', 'apprehensive', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'Phantom', 'Opera', '7', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'sister', 'took', 'performance', 'San', 'Francisco', 'saw', 'again', 'London', 'July', 'seeing', 'again', 'was', 'amped', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'translate', 'film', 'Then', 'friend', 'lent', 'soundtrack', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'was', 'hearing', 'also', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'put', 'off', 'seeing', 'now', 'first', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'been', 'changed', 'added', 'one', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'not', 'auction', 'original', 'performance', 'Raoul', 'who', 'most', 'items', 'sale', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'did', 'transition', 'Present', 'past', 'thing', 'was', 'altered', 'was', 'introduction', 'new', 'owners', 'Carlotta', 'departure', 'Raoul', 'was', 'never', 'first', 'meeting', 'play.Another', 'major', 'change', 'was', 'end', 'act', '1', 'chandelier', 'was', 'supposed', 'fall', 'curtain', 'Il', 'Muto', 'Christine', 'returns', 'perform', 'lead', 'being', 'biggest', 'Phantom', 'crimes', 'attempt', 'forcing', 'owners', 'cast', 'compliance', 'falling', 'chandelier', 'delayed', 'end', ""n't"", 'give', 'same', 'feeling', 'intro', 'act', '2', 'bad', 'song', 'Masquerade', 'written', 'reflect', 'costumes', 'attendee', 'lyrics', 'go', 'Flash', 'mauve', '/', 'Splash', 'puce', '/', 'Fool', 'king', '/', 'Ghoul', 'goose', '/', 'Green', 'black', '/', 'Queen', 'priest', '/', 'Trace', 'rouge', '/', 'Face', 'beast', 'Grinning', 'yellows', 'spinning', 'reds', 'ask', 'where', 'color', 'only', 'color', 'be', 'opera', 'crew', 'scenes', 'masqueraders', 'wear', 'variations', 'Black', 'White', 'Gold', 'What', 'kind', 'masquerade', 'monotone', 'fact', 'many', 'attendees', 'had', 'painted', 'resemble', 'Phantom', 'seemed', 'bit', 'forced', 'script', 'play', 'Christine', 'traded', 'dance', 'partners', 'who', 'resemble', 'way', 'Phantom', 'never', 'say', 'blatantly', 'have', 'face', 'Also', 'what', 'Phantom', 'scene', 'entrance', ""n't"", 'more', 'lights', 'dimming', 'few', 'flashbulbs', 'instead', 'grand', 'performance', 'should', 'be', 'One', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'was', 'how', 're-wrote', 'Phantom', 'past', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'discovered', 'when', 'Meg', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'freed', 'never', 'escaped', 'anything.As', 'acting', 'Well', 'borrow', 'Phantom', 'phrasing', 'was', 'lamentable', 'mess', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'peformance', 'was', 'decent', 'parts', 'lacking', 'others', 'much', 'young', 'fill', 'shoes', 'Christine', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'not', 'great', 'choice', 'one', 'Phantom', 'meant', 'be', 'physically', 'revolting', 'yet', 'just', 'had', '2nd', 'degree', 'burns', 'healed', 'quite', 'well.Honestly', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'contrived', 'forced', 'one', 'should', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'drivel', 'want', 'love', 'story', 'find', 'something', 'less', 'gag-worthy', 'go', 'see', 'stage', 'performance']",N/A

Emmy Rossum more than made up for his shortcomings as a wonderfully-talented Christine.

890232,A23DWPG5UMSXKF,B0007TKNI8,"Michael Smith ""saintzak""","[6, 23]","One star is being generous.I'm not a fan of musical theater, but many years ago I took my mother to see the stage production of Phantom of the Opera for her birthday. I remember reading a review of the show where the critic referred to Andrew Lloyd Webber as ""the Darth Vader of musical theater."" That's actually a great description, but you have to give Webber credit. He always unleashes an arsenal of catchy tunes that, for better or worse, stick in your head.  The sets and visuals were inventive, and the show  did acknowledge its over-the-top corniness in a charming way. It wasn't an unpleasant experience. My mother loved it.The movie! an absolute mess. The easiest description would be to imagine both of  Joel Schumacher's dreadful Batman films with singing. He may have been a good window dresser, but  he's a terrible film maker. The film's design and production is overblown and garish to the point of vulgar. Even if the film had been well made the disastrous casting choices would have sunk  it.  Emmy Rossum as Christine sings well, but she's a terrible actress. With her vacant, blank stare and perpetual weird smile, she seems to drift through the movie in a narcotic haze.  Patrick Wilson looks pasty and wormy as the ""hero."" Minnie Driver (too young and thin to play the opera's diva) is so annoying I wondered why they just didn't go all the way and cast Fran Drescher.  Mention ""Phantom of the Opera""  to anyone and the first thing they'll think of is Lon Chaney's iconic image.  A handsome, hunky Phantom just doesn't work at all. We see almost all of Gerard Butler's face even with the tiny mask on. Unmasked  he looks like...well he has a little skin problem. And he can't sing. He struggled badly with the dramatic moments of his songs, and I actually felt sorry for him. The music itself was another problem. I would have assumed even the stage version would have updated the arrangements. The synth-pop disco stuff sounded like something from an Ultra 80's compilation. I kept waiting for a Dead or Alive song to pop up.  It was more bombastic than anything Meatloaf has ever unleashed.What I found offensive about this film was the cynical attitude of the film makers. There was no attempt to make a good film, just an effort to ""put kiesters in the seats."" A play or stage musical has to be re-imagined for the screen. Bob Fosse  did  a brilliant job of this with Cabaret, and actually created the definative version of that show. Clearly, the objective here was to pander to the Phantom geeks (you know who you are: Phantom sweatshirt over a turtleneck, seen the show at least 8 times), and appeal to the younger Moulin Rouge crowd at the same time. Oil and water don't mix. Elements from the play were lifted out-right, but just looked cheap and stagy on screen. The frenetic fill-the-screen to limit with big sets, big props, non-stop movement drained any emotion from the characters and story. Moving the chandelier drop from the middle to end was a bad decision. It left a gaping hole in the middle of the story and was a non-event at the end when the real drama was focused elswhere. Also, the play was completely sung through with no dialogue. Adding dialogue and back stories just padded an already bloated film. Moving back and forth between singing narative and spoken made it even more chaotic and confusing. Two thirds of the way through I almost stood up and screamed, ""Stop! Please stop!""Andrew Lloyd Webber should have found a very talented, inventive director and said, ""Make my play into a great film."" Instead he hired a hack and said, ""Let's make alot of money.""

890233,A3CJGHGWG2PUDM,B0007TKNI8,Michael Toscano,"[2, 3]","Well, I have now seen the movie and the musical twice, and after seeing it again for the second time last night, I felt the need to share my thoughts on this film. First of all, I've been a fan of the musical for years and have been waiting for this film to hit the screen for years. And I am not sure if, it was worth-the-wait. When seeing the teaser/theatrical trailer, I was absolutly excited and shocked because it looked like the film was going to be just as effective as the musical is. I've been worried of the end result of the film since the beginning when Joel Schumacher was signed on for this project. Joel Schumacher isn't at all the best director, especially since he murdered the Batman series, and it has been said by actors that he cant direct his way out of a paper bag (by Elijah Wood). But I was pretty happy with visuals, which were quite beautiful and felt they were up to par with my perception of the story.But some of the shots and little detail in the way of his direction I found to be pretty useless and plainly bad. To this day, I personally feel I could have directed this movie better than he did (Side Note: I want to be a filmmaker) But script should have been made tighter and some parts of it were just plain useless and should have been cut to pace up the movie. Example: At the conclusion of Masquerade, the phantom disappers through fake-looking CGI fire into a trap door in the floor, where Raoul follows and tries to get the phantom but isn't sure which one is the real one, due to the mirrors. I just didnt see the point of that, and another example was the sword-fight in the graveyard. To me it just seemed to have no effect on the film or the story. And for some reason I hated that they tried as much as they could to take the story outside of the opera house (with the B&W; Flashbacks throughout the movie (except the opening)). I am not sure where I stand on the changing of positions of the chandlier falling, I did feel it was highly effective at the end. But when I first saw this film, I was just waiting and waiting for it to happen.But there are some good things in the progression of the film like the way they showed visually the reverse of time with the overture playing.

890234,A20LOBZWE5FU1R,B0007TKNI8,"Michael West ""Michael""","[7, 9]","I have seen several productions of this musical and have owned the Original Cast Recording since 1988. Yet, while I thrill to the sound of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman's incredible voices and the sight of the chandelier rising into the rafters, even I must admit that there has always been something missing from Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage version. There are many scenes (""Notes"" springs instantly to mind) that feel...well...stagy, and the story is as thin as a sheet of music. It was my hope that a film version would ""open up"" the opera house and flesh out this tale of Beauty and the Beast.I was not disappointed.Director, co-writer Joel Schumacher delivers a fully fashioned tale that embraces the spectacle of the source material and even, dare I say it, improves upon it.  Working with an all-star production team that included designer Anthony Pratt (""Excalibur""), art director John Fenner (""Raiders of the Lost Ark""), set decorator Celia Bobak (Branagh's ""Henry V"" and ""Hamlet"") and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (""Elizabeth""), Schumacher's big-screen adaptation is filled with awe-inspiring moments--yet the screenplay also serves to heighten the original material's sense of longing and loss.  Nowhere is this clearer than in the black-and-white passages the director uses to separate the acts.  Like James Cameron's Titanic, these interludes, glimpses of a dark and dreary future, serve to lament the loss of youth and the death of magic. Schumacher's script also delves deeper into the psychology of the characters: Christine believes the Phantom to be the ghost of her dead father.  Light is shed on his dark origins, and we lean much more about his connection to the strict Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson).Those who long to see Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman may criticize the casting of Gerard Butler as the (only slightly) deformed Phantom, but at 18, Emmy Rossum, Jake Gyllenhaal's girlfriend in The Day After Tomorrow, gives a star-making performance as Christine--the ballet girl who's beautiful face and voice win his admiration. Having performed in New York's Metropolitan Opera at the tender age of 7, Rossum is a phenomenal talent.  She gives the role just the right mix of emotional depth and childlike wonder.Even Webber's score seems improved.  As the power of the 100-piece orchestra explodes from every speaker, any doubts I may have had about the ability of the musical to make the leap from stage to screen are shattered.  This is what moviegoing is all about. It holds sway over the audience until the final frame, and has you thinking about it for days afterward.

890235,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B0007TKNI8,Michael Zuffa,"[0, 4]","Andrew Lloyd Webber's immensely popular musical is finally given the movie treatment, and to moderate success.  Christine (Rossum) it taking singing lessons from the Phantom (Butler) at the opera house where she is a performer.  She is still learning, but when the Phantom is done with her, she will be ready for the big time.  The Phantom, when not teaching Christine, lurks around and beneath the Opera House, hiding his scarred face.  He loves Christine, but fears her rejection.With the arrival of Raoul (Wilson), a childhood sweetheart of Christine, the Phanton finds that he has waited too long, and Christine's heart has already been taken.  The jealous Phantom of the Opera then decides to take revenge.Let me say that I am not a huge fan of musicals.  I have a problem with people spontaneously bursting into song, and that somewhat colors my review.  I found ""Moulin Rouge"" and to a lesser degree ""Chicago"", the two most recent cinematic forays into the musical, to be superior, especially in terms of songs.  Nothing stands out to me as being remarkable in ""Phantom"", although I do thing the actors try their hardest.Emily Rossum is the standout in this otherwise unknown cast.  I cannot help but think that a few bigger names might have helped things along somewhat.  Joel Schumacher, the man responsible for the downfall of the ""Batman"" franchise, crafts a beautiful looking movie.  It looks so good that I wanted to like the movie more than I did.Acknowledging that this is probably a better movie than I think, here is my qualified review: if you like the stage version of this, or musicals in general, you will enjoy ""Phanton"" quite a bit.

There is so much detail and color everywhere that you will have to watch this film again to take it all in. The two leads are great in the acting and singing department, especially Rossum (an angel's voice to go with that beautiful face) who is the standout of the group.

It is a new experience in a musical and I cannot praise it enough.  I will be putting in my pre-order for this film very shortly.  Gerard Butler is the most amazing actor I have ever seen and though I have seen many incarnations of the Phantom in film and on stage, I feel that his performance gives true emotional life to the Phantom and makes him someone we can all relate to.  All the other performances were great and I loved Minnie Driver's Carlotta...she was perfect for the role.  The story is beautiful and even though I've seen the movie close to 20 times, I will always draw in a breath when the chandelier is lifted.  Deny the critics.

Comparing to the show I thought they did a great job! This classic story of a Phantom,"" the masked man"" who roams the Opera in Paris is spellbinding. The Phantom falls in love with Christine, whom he secretly tutors. He becomes extremely jealous when a man comes into her live from the past and they are deeply in love.  This starts the extreme chaos at the Opera. I absolutely love the story. The costumes and the scenery made the movie have more of a magical touch. I thought the movie was done perfectly. I think it is a good movie to add to your Broadway to Screen movies (Chicago). Though the movie is excellent it may not do well at theaters. It doesn't have the biggest draw of different people. This movie is for people who love romance and music in a movie. I think this movie however will do extremely do well when coming to home viewing.

I also expected a much better result with the stageshow's composer/creator as producer. Sadly, this film fell very short of my expectations and is one of the few movies I've seen which I simply can't stand to watch. It came off pitiful at best, and is not one I'd recommend to my friends. As a listener of the original London Cast soundtrack for years, I was familiar with the music and had a rough grasp of the story. I was curious about the film, and thought ""Well, Andrew Lloyd Webber is working with the filmmakers, so it must be good"". Boy, was I wrong.This film adaptation is boring, incongruous, lacking in any emotional depth or honesty, and grating on the ears. It makes any other musical adaptation's jump from stage to screen, even how terrible, seem like nothing. Anyone who was hoping this would be the great immortalization of one of the best, most timeless musicals will be severely disappointed. Even Andrew Lloyd Webber's brilliant music couldn't save this travestuous adaptation simply because it too was severely altered.I know that my review will get passed over by all the others that laud this film's brilliance, so I'll begin by telling you my own first impression: The first time I saw this, I came away feeling unsettled and totally appalled by the ridiculous and insane spectacle I had just witnessed. Five years later, I still feel this way, only now I'm just angry that some better choices weren't made in production. The choice of Joel Shumacher as director was madness, and every decision after that just got worse. Don't get me wrong here; I LOVED the musical and plan to see it again when I get the chance, but the film just doesn't reach to such heights in my book.I would say this movie was passable and I might be able to enjoy it and overlook the differences between film and show if the music itself hadn't been so severly butchered by the awful choices made in the orchestration department, as well as the beating each song took when belted out by the unfortunate cast. The songs aren't electrifying or exciting anymore, and might end up putting you to sleep. When a great musical like ""Phantom of the Opera"" turns out bad, you know you've picked the wrong people to handle it.For one thing, the choice of actors is atrocious. They have absolutely no chemistry at all, and seem almost perpetually bored, sleepwalking, zombie-like, through their parts. None of them have acting abilities up to the caliber required for such roles, and their voices are nowhere near as strong as they should be for any musical. They sound below average of what you'd find in even the worst Off-Broadway show. They can't even sing on key! They also frequently over-act, under-sing, or whisper, a combination that doesn't work well at all on film and certainly something you can't do on in live theatre without getting booed off the stage. There are so many people who have played in ""Phantom"" on Broadway, in London, and on tour for years, and would have done marvelously, but sadly, none of those wonderful actors and actresses made it in.Patrick Wilson as Raoul was bland and forgettable, even worse than in the original book, though I guess the one thing he has going for him is that he actually can sing, something that seems to have eluded the rest of the cast.Emmy Rossum is much too young to play Christine. At age seventeen, she just doesn't have the chops to carry out any of the songs effectively. She's no Sarah Brightman, that's for sure, and isn't believable as an opera ingenue with such a thin voice as she has. Also, not seem too critical, but she's not much of an actress, and I couldn't believe that anyone would think of her as first choice to play the character who basically carries the whole weight of the story on her shoulders.But if those two are bad, what comes next is even worse. Whoever picked Gerard Butler for the title character made the biggest mistake of all. Mr. Butler had no vocal training prior to being cast, and in this film it sounds like he still needs a lot more. He sort of growls his way through the film, and is also (I know, evil word here) WAY TOO YOUNG for the part. The Phantom isn't supposed to be really old, but he's supposed to have lived under the Opera for many years, and had many careers before turning recluse. It's impossible that he was only in his thirties by the time Christine crossed his path. Even in view of this fact, it would be all right if Butler could act the part of the mad but tender Phantom effectively, but he doesn't. He is gruff and unromantic, certainly not anyone you could picture falling in love with, and certainly not the first person you'd think of as the Angel of Music. As if that weren't bad enough, his supposed disfigurement is so seriously diminished that you don't want to pity his unfortunate situation, but rather ask him why a guy like that would go hide in the cellars of the Opera when all he needed was some minor plastic surgery?I know that the filmmakers chose to have younger, more physically appealing cast in order to appeal to a wider range of audience, a choice which seems to have worked (Just look at the 1,000+ positive reviews on Amazon alone!), but I take it as a major insult to Michael Crawford that Andrew Lloyd Webber chose not to at least ask him to reprise the role he made famous on stage. This movie had been in talks since 1990, but was put on hold when Webber divorced Sarah Brightman. Crawford had expressed interest in playing the Phantom the whole time. It isn't his fault that it took fourteen years to finally materialize. Even so, I'd take Mr. Crawford over Mr. Butler any day. He looks much better in the cape, and could beat Butler in a singing contest at any age. Even Sarah Brightman at forty-five would have done a better Christine than Rossum's whispery, bosom-flaunting portrayal. What was up with those distressingly low-cut gowns? Ugh!The look of the film is all right, I suppose, but it could have been better. In comparing the show to the film, the film is warmer in color and less foggy and mysterious, something I really loved and wish would have been included. It could have looked really spectacular on film. The Masquerade scene is reduced to a monochrome mess with misnomer lyrics (""Flash of mauve, flash of puce, fool and king, ghoul and goose..."") What? In black and white? All I can hope is that the costume designer was color-blind. Nearly of the magical elements are taken out (The magic Punjab Lasso, for example, or the Phantom's exit in the final scene), and the world is presented as less of a fantastic place and more a concrete-hard reality. Also, all of the grand, over-the-top theatricality which really made the show stand out has kind of evaporated, which makes this film just as boring and usual as every other one relased in the last ten years.The movie was also too violent and visually disturbing, which made watching all two-and-a-half hours a painful experience. I'm still astonished how it can be frightening in all the wrong ways and still manages to be unexciting. I also didn't like the depressingly modern feel of the film, brought on by the lazy way in which the actors pronounced and performed their lines, despite the Victorian-esque design and setting. It seemed like a painfully lengthy soap-opera with fancy sets.Since seeing this film, I have read Gaston Leroux's book many times and have seen the stage version once. I have to recommend only the latter two if you want to have a good time.

890254,AP50P603W4BA7,B0007TKNI8,"Ms. H. Sinton ""dragondrums""","[5, 7]","Emmy Rossum stars as Christine Daae, a young dancer with the Opera Populaire in Paris. She has been having her voice trained by the mysterious 'Angel of Music' so when the Diva, Carlotta (brilliantly portrayed by Minnie Driver) storms out, Christine is propelled into the lead role of the opera house's latest production.What Christine doesn't realise is that her angel of music is also the infamous Phantom and that he is obsessed with her. As Christine falls in love with her childhood sweetheart, Raoul de Chagny (Patrick Wilson), the phantom becomes increasingly unbalanced and determined to possess the young singer no matter what.Joel Schumacher's glossy production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's best loved musical stars, for the most part, a relatively unknown cast, but that doesn't detract in any way from the quality of the film. Rossum was only 17 when this was filmed but she brings a remarkable maturity to her role and she has an incredibly good voice. Gerard Butler, who plays the phantom, doesn't have such a strong voice, but, thanks in the main to his sympathetic and sensitive portrayal of the tortured creature, he pulls it off. A real surprise was Jennifer Ellison (better known to British viewers as the young soap star from 'Brookside') who plays Meg, Christine's best friend. In this role, Ellison shows she can not only act but can sing very well too. Minnie Driver, cast as the spoiled, conceited Carlotta, injects humour and exuberance into her role. She is the only cast member who doesn't perform her own songs but you cannot tell this when watching the film.As would be expected from such a production, the cinematography is outstanding, the costumes are sumptuous and the sets are marvellous. This DVD is presented over 2 discs. Disc 1 is the movie while disc 2 has a wealth of extras such as 'Behind the Mask; the story of Phantom of the Opera', various featurettes and several music videos taken from stage versions of the musical.

Doyle ""film buff""","[5, 6]","After reading some indifferent reviews from several so-called qualified ""critics"", I kept my fingers crossed and hoped for the best because, frankly, I love the Andrew Lloyd Webber score that I had only heard on recordings. Never saw the stage version.I loved it!! And if you appreciate musicals of this caliber (it's operatic in concept), you'll find much to admire.Handsome Gerard Butler has been unfairly attacked for giving a poor vocal performance because he doesn't have the high tenor capabilities of Michael Crawford. Forget about it--he's in fine shape, physically and vocally and delivers a strong, sometimes tender and always masculine performance that is altogether in keeping with this concept of the story. He is strong in conveying the pain of the tortured creature he plays.Others are well cast too. Emmy Rossum has a clear, lyric soprano voice and is clearly up to the task of performing the demanding songs in a pleasing fashion while projecting youthful innocence and luminous beauty.Patrick Wilson is very effective as Raoul. His diction is impeccable, even in song. Unfortunately, the same cannot always be said of the other singers--many times the lack of clear enunciation leaves the lyrics inexplicable, which was true in the stage version too.Aside from minor flaws, the film is gorgeous to look at, brilliantly staged for maximum effect from the very opening shot of the Paris Opera Populaire in 1916 (photographed in black and white) until the final climactic scenes beneath the famed opera house. All of it is filmed in a continually moving and prowling camera movement that makes us feel that the phantom's prowling has become part of our viewing experience.It all has a dark, glittering style that is entirely in keeping with the atmosphere needed to make this kind of story ring true. Richly photographed and sensuous in its appeal, it will keep you absorbed throughout its entire running time. The full orchestra orchestrations of the 110 piece orchestra are an added bonus for the movie version, particularly when rendering the Phantom theme at full throttle.All I can say is, if you like the Webber score, you'll love what they've accomplished here, giving lush cinematic style to the prowling camera-work that seems to cover every corner of the mysterious stage settings.Minnie Driver provides effective comic relief as La Carlotta in her over-the-top performance, as do Ciarin Hinds and Simon Callow as the new opera owners. Settings, costumes and John Mathieson's stunning cinematography cannot be praised highly enough.Don't believe those negative reviews. No doubt this will be regarded as a masterpiece in years to come, when strict adherence to the stage version is no longer important and comparisons to Brightman and Crawford are relegated to the past. Furthermore, from what I've seen of Brightman's performance, her stylized approach to the role never would have worked on film.Visually, it's one of the most sumptuous productions of this story that you are ever likely to see.",5,Cinematic version of Broadway musical is visually stunning and highly satisfactory...,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,3022,"['reading', 'indifferent', 'reviews', 'several', 'so-called', 'qualified', 'critics', 'kept', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'hoped', 'best', 'because', 'frankly', 'love', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'score', 'had', 'only', 'heard', 'recordings', 'Never', 'saw', 'stage', 'version.I', 'loved', 'appreciate', 'musicals', 'caliber', 'operatic', 'concept', ""'ll"", 'find', 'much', 'admire.Handsome', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'been', 'unfairly', 'attacked', 'giving', 'poor', 'vocal', 'performance', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'tenor', 'capabilities', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'Forget', 'fine', 'shape', 'physically', 'vocally', 'strong', 'sometimes', 'tender', 'always', 'masculine', 'performance', 'altogether', 'keeping', 'concept', 'story', 'strong', 'conveying', 'pain', 'tortured', 'creature', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'too', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'clear', 'lyric', 'soprano', 'voice', 'clearly', 'up', 'task', 'performing', 'demanding', 'songs', 'pleasing', 'fashion', 'projecting', 'youthful', 'innocence', 'luminous', 'beauty.Patrick', 'Wilson', 'very', 'effective', 'Raoul', 'diction', 'impeccable', 'even', 'song', 'Unfortunately', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'singers', 'many', 'times', 'lack', 'clear', 'enunciation', 'lyrics', 'inexplicable', 'was', 'true', 'stage', 'version', 'minor', 'flaws', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'brilliantly', 'staged', 'maximum', 'effect', 'very', 'opening', 'shot', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'Populaire', '1916', 'photographed', 'black', 'white', 'final', 'climactic', 'scenes', 'famed', 'opera', 'house', 'filmed', 'continually', 'moving', 'prowling', 'camera', 'movement', 'feel', 'phantom', 'prowling', 'become', 'part', 'viewing', 'experience.It', 'dark', 'glittering', 'style', 'entirely', 'keeping', 'atmosphere', 'needed', 'make', 'kind', 'story', 'ring', 'true', 'Richly', 'photographed', 'sensuous', 'appeal', 'will', 'keep', 'absorbed', 'entire', 'running', 'time', 'full', 'orchestra', 'orchestrations', '110', 'piece', 'orchestra', 'are', 'added', 'bonus', 'movie', 'version', 'particularly', 'when', 'rendering', 'Phantom', 'theme', 'full', 'throttle.All', 'can', 'say', 'like', 'Webber', 'score', ""'ll"", 'love', 'what', ""'ve"", 'accomplished', 'here', 'giving', 'lush', 'cinematic', 'style', 'prowling', 'camera-work', 'cover', 'corner', 'mysterious', 'stage', 'settings.Minnie', 'Driver', 'effective', 'comic', 'relief', 'La', 'Carlotta', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'do', 'Ciarin', 'Hinds', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'new', 'opera', 'owners', 'Settings', 'costumes', 'John', 'Mathieson', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'praised', 'highly', 'enough.Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'negative', 'reviews', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'regarded', 'masterpiece', 'years', 'come', 'when', 'strict', 'adherence', 'stage', 'version', 'no', 'longer', 'important', 'comparisons', 'Brightman', 'Crawford', 'are', 'relegated', 'past', 'Furthermore', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Brightman', 'performance', 'stylized', 'approach', 'role', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'film.Visually', 'one', 'most', 'sumptuous', 'productions', 'story', 'are', 'ever', 'likely', 'see']",N/A

The costumes are beautiful, and the sets stunning, the actors top notch.But the problem is the Phantom. While undeniably sexy and just drop dead gorgeous, despite his deformation, it is easy to see how Christine has been captivated by this dark creature. But it is not his looks alone that have seduced her, it is his voice. I give Gerard Butler an ""A"" for effort (and A++ for fitting the physique of the role perfectly) but he lacks the vocal qualities that make him as the Phantom a truly convincing fit and for that I give him a C+, because he's really not that bad, he's just not as good as he needs to be. He struggles with the higher, softer notes that were so velvetly delivered by Michael Crawford and San Francisco cast's Franc D'Ambrosio - a hard act to follow by anyone - as well as the powerful emotional phrases, most notably in the ""Down Once More"" sequence, painfully squawking at points. For having no formal musical training, his performance is admirable.I was pleased with the extension of Raoul's character, who is usually so flat and undeveloped, it is hard to see why Christine chooses him. Even still, I noticed a lack of chemistry between the two characters and actors. While it is evident that they cared deeply for each other, I wasn't convinced of any true romantic feelings between them. I felt that Raoul could have been more emotional in his singing. Also, Christine's wide-eyed innocence is rather flat. I know her character isn't supposed to carry the flare of, say Minnie Driver's absolutely hilarious, wonderfully over-the-top La Carlotta (a true feat of casting, here), but Emmy Rossum's Christine seems to have fallen a little flat, waffling only between wide-eyed hypnosis and surprise. A real gem was Miranda Richardson's Madame Giry, giving a wonderful performance as the protective (of both her daughter and the phantom) and somewhat mysterious lady.A change that everyone noticed and an inconsistency for those who have never seen the musical in the theatre, is the glorious graveyard scene when Christine visits her father's grave. Mr Daae was supposed to be poor, Christine only able to be a chorus girl and instead we see a magnificent mausoleum for the Daae household. Had she been this rich, she might have been able to be a more prominent figure in the opera productions. My only explanation is that the Phantom might have secretly erected this monument for her, as he still in this production seems to be older than her, even if only by what looks like 5 years.Nevertheless, the setting of this movie is exquisite, the addition of a sword-fight between Raoul and the Phantom was clever and well-fit, and I loved being submerged into the darkness of this film, and only wish that Schumacher for all his inspiration (including his borrowing a scene from Jean Cocteau's La belle et la bete) had found a stronger Phantom, and encouraged more abandon in the acting, especially Christine and Raoul's characters. Then the film would have been perfection.

I strongly questioned whether a musical that was intended for the stage could ever be done justice on film.  The answer was a resounding ""Yes!""The quality of the music and vocals was superb, which is not surprising since this score is one of the all-time greats.  The movie script was true to the original stage play, and the actors did an excellent job of bringing depth to their characters, especially the Phantom.  The color and pageantry of the costumes was a wonderful treat for the eyes.  The settings and props were of first-rate quality, and were immediately recognizable and familiar from those I had seen on the stage.  Even better, there were scenes that were either added or modified somewhat, such as Raoul galloping off through the snow on his horse to rescue Christine at the cemetery, or the special effects surrounding the crash of the chandolier, to add a bit of flair that was not reproducible on stage.In short, the quality of this production does not suffer one iota for being done in a video format.  The only thing that lessens it at all is that it must necessarily be compared to the unparalleled excellence of the live experience, but this runs a close second.

However as I was waiting for the releasing of DVD especially the 2-Disc Special Edition.  I was so disappointed to the way that they put the special feature.  I meant that I would love to see lot...lot...lot of things in the film such as an interview of Gerard Butler, Joel Schumacher, Patrick Wilson, etc. But after watching the special feature parts ""Behind the Mark"" I did understand for one thing that ALW would like to honor the original casts and crews of ""The Phantom of The Opera"" (Stage Performance).  That part took almost 70 mins with the interviewing, the old footages of something that you might called it as the historical of the stage shows in bits and pieces.  I'm not said that I hate it but...it bored me to death.  I would appreciated if they put the bits and pieces of behind the scene, the rehearsal, the singing class or voice practices of the cast especially Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson.  The only part that I really like is the deleted scene ""No One Would Listen"" and the cast & crew sing-along (that's very funny).

The Phantom has serious anger management issues and ALL women should steer clear of this dude at all costs! In a month  if Christine had married the Phantom, she'd be fleeing to the nearest Abused Women's Shelter.But this was a beautiful movie to watch. I agree, it was very miscast. I saw the original play in L.A. in '92 and it pretty much put me to sleep. I thought I was sick of the music score and not impressed with the story, but I was very wrong.This movie refreshed the music score by making the story clearer to me. I don't normally care for Minnie Driver, but she nearly stole the whole movie as the Prima Donna/Diva (bad) Opera singer. Ciaran Hinds, who played Caeser in HBO's Rome, shows his versatility at comedy as one of the put-upon new Opera House owners. The costumes and sets were magnificent. Yes, Gerard Butler was mis-cast.

It's my all time favorite musical because it was the first show I had ever seen on Broadway and also because it was just amazing IMO. When I heard there was a movie coming out based on the play, I was really excited. However, when I was watching it, I thought, ""What have they done?!"" The first thing to point out is that every one is a terrible singer. Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson are too weak and they're the romantic leads. Gerard Butler (he was great in 300 but...) has no business playing the Phantom. I understand that he was trying to add a new rock-style to the role and I appreciate that but for the Phantom it just doesn't work. He basically screams the notes instead of singing them and when he doesn't scream he just swallows the notes so it sounds artificial and not beautiful. Second, the lip-syncing was beyond saving. During ""Think of Me"" Christine sings kinda pretty but her lips are barely moving and just stands there like a lifeless mannequin. Gerard Butler just over enunciates everything so it looks pretty ridiculous. Third, the direction by Joel Schumacher (the guy behind the atrocious Batman & Robin) is lazy. He's so concerned with the fabulous art direction and cinematography that he forgets about the story and characters. The whole movie is just so dull that the sense of excitement and romance in the play are lost in the transition to the silver screen. Overall, I can't recommend this as decent entertainment although I know I stand against the masses. Skip this one.

As with others who have written reviews, this is one of my favorite shows, and I am a nonrepentent Lloyd Webber fan.The film changes the story around a bit from the stage production, and I think it may have taken some of the mystery away from the ""Angel of Music"" and the Phantom himself.  The stage productions I have seen present the lagoon scene much later in the story, and it keeps the Phantom as a shadowy figure whom even Christine doesn't really know and has never really seen.  I also think the Phantom is much more accessible in this film than in the stage version.  In the film, he is sighted many times by people right on the stage rather than being the subject of a ""ghost story"" until his love for Christine makes him come forward as in the stage versions.  One wonders if the film Phantom wouldn't have been sharing lunch with the crew considering how accessible he is.  Also, one of the other reviews shown here states that the Phantom is made too sympathetic.  This is true, but I think he loses that sympathy when he speaks from Christine's father's crypt making her think that it is her father recommending that she go with him rather than with Raoul.The film cast is very good.  Messrs Butler and Wilson, and Ms. Rossum are all excellent actors and show it.  I'm glad Ms. Rossum has finally been discovered.  I saw her first in ""Songbird"", and I think she is finally blossoming into a beautiful and talented young woman with a lovely voice.  Simon Callow gaves his usual wonderful performance and the ""over the top"" performance of Minnie Driver as the Prima Donna is wonderful.  She deserves the supporting actress nominations she won from several organizations.All in all, this is a film which should be owned and watched over and over just as I listen to my cast recording.  Gerard Butler does not sing as well as Michael Crawford or other actors who played the Phantom in other productions I have seen on stage.  His voice was stretched several times.  However, both Mr Crawford and Ms. Brightman, as talented as they are, are getting a little beyond the age where they could play these parts on screen.

But the magic of the stage play was not there.  The editor left in too much of the director's follies, there are many unnecessary scenes that just drag the pace down to a yawn.While the movie starts out great it loses pace after the first visually-exciting underground scene.

890284,A1BVKUA32LKR2W,B0007TKNI8,Phantom Bookworm,"[0, 1]","My mom always loved the music to The Phantom of the Opera, but I wasn't officially introduced to it until I was twelve (when it first came out). My world geography teacher had seen it and loved it so much, he decided to dedicate a week of class listening to the soundtrack and going over the story. At the end of the week, he assigned extra credit to anyone who went to see it over the weekend. I was already determined to see it because I was intrigued by the storyline and mesmerized by the music.Eight years later and it still remains one of my top three favorite movies of all time. I've seen the play on Broadway since then and have read my fair share of Phantom 'fan fiction'. The movie is pretty different from seeing it live on stage, but I've found over time that the beauty of the story lies in its ability to adapt in one's interpretaton of it. Some people like a crazy Phantom, while others prefer a softer portrayal of the masked anti-hero. Sometimes Christine is dreadfully afraid of the Phantom and in other adaptations she's in love with him.I think part of why this particular story has been retold so many times throughout the years and loved by so many is that everyone has the flexibility to see what they want to see.The Phantom of the Opera is about a young chorus girl named Christie who is receiving private voice lessons from a mysterious Angel of Music. She believes the Angel is the spirit of her dead father because he promised on his deathbed he would send her the Angel for protection, comfort, and tutelage when he passed on. Little does she know, the Angel is in fact the infamous Opera Ghost who frequently terrorizes those who don't follow his commands. He contacts her from behind her dressing room mirror, reluctant to reveal his true identity for fear Christine will shun him. He is deeply obsessed with her and eagerly awaits the day he can present himself to her as a man.The story begins when the old manager of the opera house decides to retire. The new managers, Firmin and Andre, don't buy into the stories of the Opera Ghost and refuse to be ordered around by an invisible specter. In addition to new management, the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny has become the opera's new patron. Christine and Raoul instantly recognize one another as childhood sweethearts, and rekindle their relationship. Despite the Phantom's efforts to seduce Christine with his music, she and Raoul fall deeply in love. This only manages to make matters worse. Christine, Raoul, and the Phantom become tangled in a web of passion, jealousy, obsession, and darkness.First and foremost, the music is simply divine and stays with me for weeks at a time upon listening. There is something hypnotic, exhilerating, and majestic about it. It captures the essence of melodrama and Gothic romance perfectly. I love everyone's voices, indlucing Gerard Butler's. He may not be a conventional Phantom, but I really enjoyed the rich, sensual, passionate sound of his voice in contrast to Raoul's sweet, soft one. I'm not really sure how this movie didn't win more awards for costume and design because the costumes and sets are lush, sumptuous, and grand in scale.This adaptation of the musical emphasizes on the relationship between the Phantom and Christine. Instead of being overwhelmed by her fear of him, Christine is portrayed as having a deeper, more soulful connection with the Phantom. She is in love with Raoul, but there is a side of her that responds to the Phantom's advances. Even though Gerard Butler plays more of a sexy Phantom, I think he understood the role well enough to bring the power and force required to fulfill the role. He starts out as seductive and passionate, and eventually progresses to a raging, broken shell of a man with deep insecurities. I like that despite his appealing physical qualities, he managed to stay true to the Phantom's volatile emotional core.Emmy Rossum is perfect as the naive and gentle Christine who is struggling to come to terms with her father's death. Patrick Wilson is not always the most expressive actor, but he has some shining moments throughout the film and has the perfect singing voice for Raoul. Minnie Driver was entertaining as Carlotta, the spoiled and selfish Prima Donna of the Opera Populaire. Everyone else does a very good job too!This movie is definitely worth seeing for anyone interested in musicals or in the story. It's very complex, emotional, often times sad and other times triumphant, and will leave any hopeless romantic satisfied.",5,One of my favorite movies of all time!,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,4517,"['mom', 'always', 'loved', 'music', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'was', ""n't"", 'officially', 'introduced', 'was', 'twelve', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'world', 'geography', 'teacher', 'had', 'seen', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'dedicate', 'week', 'class', 'listening', 'soundtrack', 'going', 'story', 'end', 'week', 'assigned', 'extra', 'credit', 'anyone', 'who', 'went', 'see', 'weekend', 'was', 'already', 'determined', 'see', 'was', 'intrigued', 'storyline', 'mesmerized', 'music.Eight', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'one', 'top', 'three', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'Broadway', 'then', 'have', 'read', 'fair', 'share', 'Phantom', 'fiction', 'movie', 'pretty', 'different', 'seeing', 'live', 'stage', ""'ve"", 'found', 'time', 'beauty', 'story', 'ability', 'adapt', 'one', 'interpretaton', 'people', 'crazy', 'Phantom', 'others', 'prefer', 'softer', 'portrayal', 'masked', 'anti-hero', 'Sometimes', 'Christine', 'dreadfully', 'afraid', 'Phantom', 'other', 'adaptations', 'love', 'him.I', 'think', 'part', 'why', 'particular', 'story', 'been', 'retold', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'loved', 'so', 'many', 'everyone', 'flexibility', 'see', 'what', 'want', 'see.The', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'young', 'chorus', 'girl', 'named', 'Christie', 'who', 'receiving', 'private', 'voice', 'lessons', 'mysterious', 'Angel', 'Music', 'Angel', 'spirit', 'dead', 'father', 'promised', 'deathbed', 'would', 'send', 'Angel', 'protection', 'comfort', 'tutelage', 'when', 'passed', 'Little', 'know', 'Angel', 'fact', 'infamous', 'Opera', 'Ghost', 'who', 'frequently', 'terrorizes', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'commands', 'dressing', 'room', 'mirror', 'reluctant', 'reveal', 'true', 'identity', 'fear', 'Christine', 'will', 'shun', 'deeply', 'obsessed', 'eagerly', 'awaits', 'day', 'can', 'present', 'man.The', 'story', 'when', 'old', 'manager', 'opera', 'house', 'retire', 'new', 'managers', 'Firmin', 'Andre', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'stories', 'Opera', 'Ghost', 'refuse', 'be', 'ordered', 'invisible', 'specter', 'addition', 'new', 'management', 'Vicomte', 'Raoul', 'de', 'Chagny', 'become', 'opera', 'new', 'patron', 'Christine', 'Raoul', 'instantly', 'recognize', 'one', 'childhood', 'sweethearts', 'rekindle', 'relationship', 'Phantom', 'efforts', 'seduce', 'Christine', 'music', 'Raoul', 'fall', 'deeply', 'love', 'only', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Christine', 'Raoul', 'Phantom', 'become', 'tangled', 'web', 'passion', 'jealousy', 'obsession', 'darkness.First', 'foremost', 'music', 'simply', 'divine', 'weeks', 'time', 'listening', 'something', 'hypnotic', 'exhilerating', 'majestic', 'essence', 'melodrama', 'Gothic', 'romance', 'perfectly', 'love', 'everyone', 'voices', 'indlucing', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'conventional', 'Phantom', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'rich', 'sensual', 'passionate', 'sound', 'voice', 'contrast', 'Raoul', 'sweet', 'soft', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'how', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'more', 'awards', 'costume', 'design', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'lush', 'sumptuous', 'grand', 'scale.This', 'adaptation', 'musical', 'emphasizes', 'relationship', 'Phantom', 'Christine', 'Instead', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'fear', 'Christine', 'portrayed', 'having', 'deeper', 'more', 'soulful', 'connection', 'Phantom', 'love', 'Raoul', 'side', 'Phantom', 'advances', 'Even', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'more', 'sexy', 'Phantom', 'think', 'understood', 'role', 'well', 'enough', 'bring', 'power', 'force', 'required', 'fulfill', 'role', 'out', 'seductive', 'passionate', 'eventually', 'raging', 'broken', 'shell', 'man', 'deep', 'insecurities', 'like', 'appealing', 'physical', 'qualities', 'managed', 'stay', 'true', 'Phantom', 'volatile', 'emotional', 'core.Emmy', 'Rossum', 'perfect', 'naive', 'gentle', 'Christine', 'who', 'struggling', 'come', 'terms', 'father', 'death', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'not', 'always', 'most', 'expressive', 'actor', 'shining', 'moments', 'film', 'perfect', 'singing', 'voice', 'Raoul', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'was', 'entertaining', 'Carlotta', 'spoiled', 'selfish', 'Prima', 'Donna', 'Opera', 'Populaire', 'Everyone', 'else', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'too', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'anyone', 'interested', 'musicals', 'story', 'very', 'complex', 'emotional', 'often', 'sad', 'other', 'times', 'triumphant', 'will', 'leave', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'satisfied']",N/A
890285,A1CIZ90FFOZTLM,B0007TKNI8,phantomfan,"[5, 5]","For the record, my screen name is a reference to the stage play, and will remain that way, although I was happily impressed with almost everything about this movie.I have never been a particular fan of Sarah Brightman, whose voice is a little too thick and contrived for the young, pure soul of Christine.  Emmy Rossum, on the other hand, is absolutely perfect.  She was born to play this role, and it will follow her the rest of her life.  Not a bad thing.  I wish she had been playing the lead the last time I saw Phantom on stage.Patrick Wilson has a nice voice, and he was good enough in the role of Raoul, which is a fairly flat role to begin with.  However, the role can be played with greatness, and I would have liked to see the Broadway Raoul Jim Weitzer in this role, for he is fantastic.  I saw him when he was merely an understudy on the traveling tour, and he gives his Raoul life beyond the script.  Oh, well.  It's Christine's story, and Wilson is likeable enough to be believed.The music, with one exception, is spectacular, actually an improvement over the original 80's score.  The orchestrations are bigger and the sound is more modern, and yet perfectly authentic to the original.The story, with one exception, is almost word-for-word the same as the stage play, and being without the restraints of the stage leaves the filmmakers able to cut between scenes and do things a play simply can't do.  Visually the film is beautiful, full of the bright colors and glorious eye candy that those who have seen the play will expect.  There was even a moment during the opening scene, when the chandelier rose and the color splashed onto the screen and that magnificent score began, when I almost felt I was watching the play again.Minnie Driver as Carlotta is a scene-stealer, to say the least, and one of the best things about the film.  This was one instance in which the filmmakers got it right.But unfortunately they got one thing wrong, and that is Gerard Butler.  Although I have no complaints about Butler himself - he did a fine job, even a remarkable job in places - but he is simply too young and too handsome for the role, and while his voice is good, it is not nearly good enough.  He simply did not belong in this role.  The distorted face under the mask was disappointing too, as if the producers didn't want to mar his handsomeness by making him too scarred and ugly.  But scarred and ugly is the whole point.  The stage Phantom I saw the first time (Brad Little, who was brilliant) had an unforgettably gruesome face.  Butler's face looked like a mild case of acne in comparison, certainly not a face that would drive a person into madness and seclusion.  They missed by a long shot on that one.Nevertheless, I very much liked Butler's portrayal (it's not his fault, after all, that's he's young, handsome, and doesn't have a fantastic voice), especially during the Don Juan Triumphant scene.Overall I am very pleased with this movie, and I would highly recommend it to those who are unable to see it on stage.  Even to those who have seen it on stage, it will be a nice revisiting of great memories.",4,Eye candy set to music,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,3128,"['record', 'screen', 'name', 'reference', 'stage', 'play', 'will', 'remain', 'way', 'was', 'happily', 'impressed', 'almost', 'everything', 'movie.I', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'particular', 'fan', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'voice', 'little', 'too', 'thick', 'contrived', 'young', 'pure', 'soul', 'Christine', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'other', 'hand', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'role', 'will', 'follow', 'rest', 'life', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'playing', 'lead', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'Phantom', 'stage.Patrick', 'Wilson', 'nice', 'voice', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'role', 'Raoul', 'fairly', 'flat', 'role', 'begin', 'However', 'role', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'greatness', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Broadway', 'Raoul', 'Jim', 'Weitzer', 'role', 'fantastic', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'merely', 'understudy', 'traveling', 'tour', 'Raoul', 'life', 'script', 'Oh', 'well', 'Christine', 'story', 'Wilson', 'likeable', 'enough', 'be', 'believed.The', 'music', 'one', 'exception', 'spectacular', 'actually', 'improvement', 'original', '80', 'score', 'orchestrations', 'are', 'bigger', 'sound', 'more', 'modern', 'yet', 'perfectly', 'authentic', 'original.The', 'story', 'one', 'exception', 'almost', 'word-for-word', 'same', 'stage', 'play', 'being', 'restraints', 'stage', 'filmmakers', 'able', 'cut', 'scenes', 'do', 'things', 'play', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Visually', 'film', 'beautiful', 'full', 'bright', 'colors', 'glorious', 'eye', 'candy', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'play', 'will', 'expect', 'was', 'even', 'moment', 'opening', 'scene', 'when', 'chandelier', 'rose', 'color', 'splashed', 'screen', 'magnificent', 'score', 'began', 'when', 'almost', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'play', 'again.Minnie', 'Driver', 'Carlotta', 'scene-stealer', 'say', 'least', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'instance', 'filmmakers', 'got', 'unfortunately', 'got', 'one', 'thing', 'wrong', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'have', 'complaints', 'Butler', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'even', 'remarkable', 'job', 'places', 'simply', 'too', 'young', 'too', 'handsome', 'role', 'voice', 'good', 'not', 'nearly', 'good', 'enough', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'belong', 'role', 'distorted', 'face', 'mask', 'was', 'disappointing', 'too', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'mar', 'handsomeness', 'making', 'too', 'scarred', 'ugly', 'scarred', 'ugly', 'whole', 'point', 'stage', 'Phantom', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'Brad', 'Little', 'who', 'was', 'brilliant', 'had', 'unforgettably', 'gruesome', 'face', 'Butler', 'face', 'looked', 'mild', 'case', 'acne', 'comparison', 'certainly', 'not', 'face', 'would', 'drive', 'person', 'madness', 'seclusion', 'missed', 'long', 'shot', 'one.Nevertheless', 'very', 'much', 'liked', 'Butler', 'portrayal', 'not', 'fault', 'young', 'handsome', ""n't"", 'have', 'fantastic', 'voice', 'especially', 'Don', 'Juan', 'Triumphant', 'scene.Overall', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'movie', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'see', 'stage', 'Even', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'stage', 'will', 'be', 'nice', 'revisiting', 'great', 'memories']",N/A

My mom has seen it at least twice and has the original London recording on a cassette, and she used to make me listen to it when I was little...apparently I thought it scary. But when the movie came out, my friends were all dying to see it, and I was actually going to go along and humor them; never happened. We ended up waiting till it came out on dvd and rented it for Mother's Day (b/c once again, my mom wanted to see it).As soon as the overture started, with everything shining clean and sparkling, I was hooked.For everything I've heard against the cast (mainly the Phantom), I thought everyone was stellar. Patrick Wilson was sensitive and believable as Raoul. You could feel his chemistry with Rossum -- like they really had known each other their whole lives. On that note, Emmy was AMAZING. For a sixteen-seventeen year old, her voice was beautiful. I loved Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again. And she proved that she can hold her own with the older guys in the production. &lt;Warning> I am now going to gush about the Phantom. :)Gerry made the show, and he definitely doesn't get enough credit for it... But I'll give people the benefit of the doubt and say that this is a free country where everyone has their own opinions. Anyway, contrary to what others have said, his singing may have been overdone, but it's an opera! Opera is supposed to be over the top, people, come on! ...Plus he's so handsome that whatever wrong notes he hits, he makes up for it in some way, shape or form later in the film. Where Michael Crawford's voice held an edgy danger, Butler's has a sensual caress. Music of the Night is a prime example: Gerry purrs every verse, and makes everything flow so beautifully. Oh, and Point of No Return... no words for that one, it's so breathtaking. For both Gerry and Emmy. I'll stick with Wandering Child as my favorite song because I totally love the violin solo at the beginning, and the way his voice just seeps into you.Minnie Driver definitely stole some of the show. Memorable moment: Il Muto and the world's first croaking diva! Yay! Miranda Richardson was also a very good choice -- she was able to play both sides of the fence very well.Overall, a wonderfully cast, beautifully designed, brilliantly done film that deserved more awards than it won.

890287,A1CWS1OV8VVT1O,B0007TKNI8,"Phantom Man ""Gaby""","[0, 0]","This movie is da bomb, to coin a phrase. I saw five times with my friends and family. This film is what made me become a POTO phan.Emmy Rossum is sexy, beautiful, and has a voice to match! Her acting is superb as well! When she sang ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" at her father's grave, I was moved to tears. So was this big, tough-looking guy sitting next to me! I recently bought her debut album, and she sounds wonderful.Gerard Butler is AWESOME(I had no idea he was scottish)as the title character. He portrays the Phantom as not just a tortured soul, but as a genius(in the musical sense)and very romantic. His sensuality and vuneralbility are exposed, and ""Music of the Night"" made me melt in my seat. Come to think of it, every time Gerry was there made me melt in my seat! YOWZAAA!! HOTTIE ALERT!! HOTTIE ALERT!!! And I was definitely happy when I saw him again in 300, even though he didn't sing. Oh well.Patrick Wilson plays a somewhat girlie Viscomte, and his singing voice is very weak, but he keeps at it, and might make some people root for Raoul in the end. I know I kinda did. He does have a great sense of acting, and portrays a good rival to the Phantom. Although I think Christine should have picked Erik.Minnie Driver just cracked me up! She portrays Carlotta as an opera singing Miss Piggy, in the words of my sister, and that's very true. I don't know if anyone noticed, but when she says ""Until you stop these things from happening, this thing does not happen!"", she points at her boobs! For some who don't know, she sings the new song that plays over the ending credits ""Learn To Be Lonely"". Her comic timing is impeccable.Miranda Richardson(Sleepy Hollow) as Madame Giry is wonderful, and I have always enjoyed her work.

I watched the stage musical when I was in my teens and then, there was this rumour that a movie was going to be made starring the originals, Sarah Brightman & Michael Crawford.  So, I waited and before I knew it, it's over a decade.  Anyhow, the wait is worthwhile.  Referring to Joel, the director, he made a right move in choosing young cast to the production.  He did it for both reasons, to broaden the target mix and also to make sense of Christine, of her trapped in a triangular relationship between Raoul and Phantom.  The movie paces along steadily and whilst it's not following frame by frame to the musical production, the adaptation is very faithful.  On top of that, it gives us glimpse of how the Phantom came about and how did he roam about in the Theatre.  It's a bit of ""Batman Begins"" strategy.  Whilst Gerald Butler's voice isn't as distinctive as Michael Crawford's, he compensates that by his dark screen presence.  Roaul's character is two-dimensional, valiant and swashbuckling.  I would have to say that to me, the outstanding performance would have to come from veteran, Miranda Richardson who's making effort to speak English with a tinge of French accent whilst others are carrying stiff upper lip English accent.  Minnie Driver is hillarious as the Prima Donna but somehow, she's no Italiano as she's depicting in this movie.  Whilst Emmy Rossum sings like an angel, her band of performance is once again restricted to being an innocent girl.  For the beautiful direction, (set) production, and may I say, soundtrack, this is definitely a DVD to keep to watch and watch again.  Such a quiet achiever.

The acting was very well done The directing, choreography, makeup, costume, etc., all added much to each and every scene. And the score (of course) was the familiar and extraordinary Phantom of the Opera score. Emmy Rossum's Christine was a jewel -- great acting, and sublime singing. Raoul, likewise, was perfect in his part (I really hated his hair in this role, but I digress :P). All of the supporting cast delivered stellar performances as well. So why...why...WHY did they cast Gerard Butler as the Phantom? At least, without having someone who can sing (!!) perform his songs? Perhaps in a limited scope, Butler's voice would be fine; but in the Phantom of the Opera, he was way out of his league. So, you find yourself deeply immersed in the movie ... until the bellowing Phantom starts to ""sing"".  To be fair, not every thing he sings is bellowed; but he managed to ruin every song in which he had a role with his frequent bellowing. Butler's singing is my main objection to this movie, and the reason it only gets 4 stars; his acting is great, and he makes a convincing Phantom (singing aside).

890296,AEYJGHIDOO6GE,B0007TKNI8,rainforest,"[5, 7]","I was totally blown away when I saw this movie. This movie emotionally grabbed me. I spent days with my head filled with the melodies such as ""Music of the Night"", ""Angel of Music"", and ""That's All I Ask of You"". I couldn't shake it off. Sometimes it is Christine's voice; sometimes it is the phantom's voice. Rarely have I found myself so completely absorbed in a movie. This is the only movie in recent years that I have watched more than 5 times. I have also read the movie libretto more than 3 times in order to thoroughly understand the storyline. The better I understand the story, the more I like it.If I could, I would give 10 stars to this movie. I haven't watched the stage play yet and after watching this movie, I plan to. But I really don't think I will like the stage version more than the movie. Allow me to tell you why I think this movie is outstanding.(1) The story: I am totally obsessed with the love triangle in this story. It's so powerful that it emotionally hit me. I felt deep compassionate for the phantom. While he was a genies, his musical talent was totally ignored just because he was deformed. He secretly dreamed of beauty, and loved a young woman named Christine; he couldn't win her love no matter what he did because he had that loathsome face. Anybody could feel his pain when he told Christine that he secretly yearned for heaven. Let me briefly recite the story. It started with a young and beautiful chorus girl named Christine who has been taught by a mysterious tutor - the phantom. The phantom was a great musician but hid under the opera house because he was a freak of nature. After Christine's tremendously successful debut performance, the Phantom fell in love with her. He also, however, felt threatened by Christine's new suitor Raoul, a nobleman who was Christine's childhood sweetheart. So he invited her to his underground lair. The phantom mesmerized Christine with his beautiful voice and songs. On the second morning, Christine demasked him and was horrified to see his deformed face. Later, the phantom committed murder in order to make Christine the leading soprano. Christine was in fear and told Raoul that she had seen Phantom. Raoul swore to protect her and they made an oath of their mutual love. The phantom overheard of it and decided to take revenge. 6 months later, while in the masked ball, Phantom showed up with his newly written opera script Don John Triumph. He appointed Christine to sing it. Christine refused to sing, but Raoul pursued her to sing since he wanted to use this chance to catch Phantom. The opera house was surrounded with police on the day of the performance. That evening, the phantom murdered the tenor and played the tenor himself. He sang with Christine in a touching, passionate way that it would make us to believe it was the Phantom who Christine loved. For some unknown reason, Christine unmasked him in front of the audience; and the Phantom took Christine to his lair and wanted to make her his bride. Raoul came to the lair to free Christine but ended up to be captured by the phantom. The phantom demanded that Christine choose between him and Raoul. Christine kissed the phantom, and the phantom was shocked by her kiss. At that point, he let Christine and Raoul leave.(2) Music: The music in this play is intoxicatingly beautiful. I haven't watched the stage play yet, but I have listened to the original London record. I think Butler/Emmy/Patrick sing pretty well, even though Sara/Mike of the London stage, in my opinion,  play sing better. Butler's voice is more like that of a pop singer, but butler can act. Some people say the director chose the wrong person, a good looking man with a bad voice rather than a bad looking guy with a beautiful voice. Being movies that are visual, who would want to see an ugly guy in the leading romantic role? If we see a 50 years old horrible looking man deeply in love with a beautiful teenager girl, we would feel so disgusted. While Butler's phantom is dark, strong and powerful, Patrick's Raoul is sunny, and sometimes even insipid, that's what Raoul should be. This makes for a great contrast between the two men and shapes their characters even more profoundly. Emmy is also my new idol nowJ She is so beautiful and has a nice voice. Her voice is not as beauitful as Sara, but she was only 16; like Phantom said in the movie, if she wants to excel, she has much to learn. Sara's voice is professional. So I suggest, if are more drawn to the story, then watch the movie. The beautiful people in the movie are eye candy, very pleasant to watch, and you can ignore their imperfect voices. If you listen to the CD, listen to Sara and Michael's music. Their voices are delightful to listen to.(3) Actor/actress. I liked the fact that in this movie the phantom is young and handsome. The phantom is a focus in the movie, and he literally steals every scene. Many people criticise his voice, but I just loved his voice. He sings with passion. Many people don't think his makeup is that bad looking, but to me, it was. I wouldn't say that his face is gorgeous. He is gorgeous not because of his face, it is because of his character.  His masculinity, his sex appeal and voice, his chiseled features of the other unmasked face, and most important, his passion towards Christine, all these together, lead us to no longer pay attention to his face.Emma is also the perfect girl to play Christine. She is young, beautiful and has a high quality voice; what more we can ask for? And handsome Raoul; no doubt, in my heart, I can't think of any other actors are better suited to play Raoul. He is bland, because that is what is needed to contrast with the phantom. If he were as interesting as Phantom, Christine would not have such a struggle deciding between them. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. I especially adore the two new managers; they have added the right amount of humor to this sad movie.(4) The setting: Eye candy. The opera house and costumes are incredibly opulent and lavish.Let me summarize my favorite stage scenes in the movie:(1) Masquerade: visually spectacular! The music, dance and costumes are fantastic. I love one particular young black and white masked male dancer dancing solo; it was fabulous!(2) The first time phantom invited Christine to his lair: The rock-n-roll style song and the mystery of the underground lair are just breathtaking. The candle scene was hypnotic.(3) Music of the night: phantom was so passionate about the music that I feel he is the king of the music kingdom; no wonder Christine was mesmerized by his music and had no fear of him at all.(4) Pass the point of no return:  Their duet is so sensationally powerful that you believe they are the true lovers. Even Raoul was hurt by watching it; I think he realized it was Phantom that Christine was drawn to.(5) Finally, Phantom sits in front of the Monkey music box whispering the tone of Masquerade, and Christine appeared, Phantom was happy to see her and only then found out that she was back to return his ring. Phantom finally sings out : ""Christine I love you."" If you are not touched at this very emotional moment, you must be cold blooded.",5,A movie musical to die for!,1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,7194,"['was', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'when', 'saw',

On the positive side, the camera allows the audience to see the characters from different angles, and up-close.  As a film production, it's rather marvelous.  The choice for the lead singers is open for debate.  Though Gerard Butler strained to produce the Phantom's songs, he did possess a strong on-screen presence.  Emma Rosum was a big gamble by the producers.  The songs of Christine had to be modified to fit Rosum's vocal range.  The compensatory factor is Rosum's sparkling image before the camera, as well as her adept acting ability.  Like Butler, she strains to reach the highs and lows vocally, yet the more narrow and girlish range produces a feeling of sweetness and vulnerability. Overall, I enjoyed the film, as well as the performers.  I've watched Sarah Brightman filmed doing a couple of songs, as directed by Ken Russell via YouTube, and she is quite good.  Brightman looks half her age and (I believe) possess convincing acting ability.  Her voice is of such a different caliber that you simply cannot make any comparisons.  As much as I was enchanted by Rosum, I do think Brightman should have been cast as Christine.  I think the end result would have packed a lot more punch.",3,Interesting Film Adaptation,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,1314,"['first', 'minutes', 'viewing', 'film', 'realized', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'worse', 'stage', 'production', 'positive', 'side', 'camera', 'audience', 'see', 'characters', 'different', 'angles', 'up-close', 'film', 'production', 'rather', 'marvelous', 'choice', 'lead', 'singers', 'open', 'debate', 'Though', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'strained', 'produce', 'Phantom', 'songs', 'did', 'possess', 'strong', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'Emma', 'Rosum', 'was', 'big', 'gamble', 'producers', 'songs', 'Christine', 'had', 'be', 'modified', 'fit', 'Rosum', 'vocal', 'range', 'compensatory', 'factor', 'Rosum', 'sparkling', 'image', 'camera', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'ability', 'Butler', 'reach', 'highs', 'lows', 'vocally', 'yet', 'more', 'narrow', 'girlish', 'range', 'feeling', 'sweetness', 'vulnerability', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'performers', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'filmed', 'doing', 'couple', 'songs', 'directed', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'YouTube', 'quite', 'good', 'Brightman', 'age', 'believe', 'possess', 'convincing', 'acting', 'ability', 'voice', 'such', 'different', 'caliber', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'comparisons', 'As', 'much', 'was', 'enchanted', 'Rosum', 'do', 'think', 'Brightman', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'Christine', 'think', 'end', 'result', 'would', 'have', 'packed', 'lot', 'more', 'punch']",N/A

890301,A2LNP6JE11OHZR,B0007TKNI8,Razor Queen(Witch Hunter),"[7, 22]","(...)I had high hops for this film during the opening credits. The rapid breathing of life into the decrepit opera house was spectacular and I felt my anticipation grow. The first musical number was superb. Minnie Driver had great character and the singer who performed Carlotta's singing was impeccable, hitting every note effortlessly. This immediately made me apprehensive, since it is Christine who is supposed to steal the show. My fears came true as soon as she opened her mouth. I'm not saying she doesn't have a fairly beautiful voice but I felt it was too thin, with not enough depth or force to give her that added oomph needed to take my breath away.  Carlotta outshines her in everyway. The actress, Ms Rossum seems incapable of pulling of a convincing performance. She didn't convey any emotion that made me care for her. Indeed I felt more annoyance. She waltzes though the film with the same deer in the headlights expression, with a fragility that make me want to push her over and watch her smash. The graveyard scene was ruined by very fake looking snow and unnecessary cleavage. I've said it before and I'll say it again, her nipples must be killing her. No one goes for a walk in the snow with that much bare skin on display.Onto the phantom, Gerard hasn't got the voice for this. I don't care how good looking he is. He screams and yells his way through the more demanding passages and is totally out of key.  One scene springs to mind when he leaps on a gargoyle and yells `&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;that's all I ask of youuuuuuuuuuu!!!' I swear my dog left the room at that point. Its totally cringe worthy, although it could be quite amusing if he was taking the piss, but he's not, he's serious and that's the problem. This guy is so awful it's funny. I actually laughed as he tried to ham it up with all that cape swirling bravado. The sword fight is pretty pathetic as well, which leads me onto Raoul. Bland old Raoul. &iquest;Do we care about him? I was actually looking forward to him drowning, except for a design flaw in the supposedly genius phantoms water trap. &iquest;That was tricky wasn't it? Heh, yeah right. But the grand moment of this film, the unveiling of the phantom, was ruined. We hear that stage guy singing about skin like yellow parchment and holes for eyes etc (I'm not quoting, this is from memory) and so I prepared my self for something horrific but instead it was just incredulity.  I believe my original statement was: ""He starts off with a little mask on, black slicked down hair, normal visible skin and then she whips it off and all of a sudden half this guys face is deformed even his hairline has receded, and speaking of hair, its now a rather sandy colour and sticks out, obviously in an attempted to achieve that `mad scientist' look It ruins the whole moment."" I was ripped to shreds for stating that. Apparently the phantom was wearing a wig. A jolly good wig that must have taken hours to apply to get the realistic hail line I'll wager. But the argument goes on: &iquest;If the phantom was wearing a wig that realistic (which I highly doubt given those times but will consider anyway) it would obviously be stuck on quite well right? Just entertain that fact for a minute, will you. The agility and speed at which she rips of his mask and wig, (although, &iquest;How did she know it was a wig?) is far too quick. You're telling me it was all off in one fell swoop. Ah! &iquest;It's the angle, you say? I think not. Freeze framing the DVD proves that. The phantoms face changes like magic in about one second. That's what did it for me. I blame the director. I'm assuming he was going for a dramatic flair. I mean if, after shed ripped his mask off(I'm assuming it wasn't connected to the wig) it would have been quite anticlimactic to have watched her stand on tip toe and attempt to yank his wig off with him yelling `&iexcl;Ow! &iexcl;you're pulling the fake latex skin off my mangled scalp to quickly! It's a special adhesive, you see. &iexcl;liquid soluble only!' You get my point. It was unrealistic. End of story. Blame the director. Anyway the film draws to a close and the phantom, after listening to Christine and Raoul rub in the fact that they are sooo happy, makes his exit through a red drape. &iquest;Where'd he go? &iquest;Do I care? Not in the least. I never cared about any of them. We have hardly any background information concerning either character to make them worth our concern. During this short life of mine I've manage to see onstage :Carmen(the Andalucian version), Cats(twice), Fiddler On The Roof, Starlight Express, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, spirit of the dance(we were evacuated half way through, bomb scare) and a couple of pantomimes and amateur theatre company performances, all of which affected me and made me care about the characters. I've never been keen on musicals made into films and I think phantom of the opera was specifically design to be performed on a stage. I didn't enjoy this film at all. I think it was a complete waste of time and effort. I have plans to see the play and perhaps I just might feel like picking up the book in the distant future, &iquest;Who knows? But as for this film: I think the bad out ways the good, to put it bluntly, it's sh*t.",1,*I* didn't like it,1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,5277,"['had', 'high', 'hops', 'film', 'opening', 'credits',

890303,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0007TKNI8,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[4, 5]","Gerard Butler gives a stunning performance as the moody reclusive Phantom of the Opera. His obsession with Christine (Emmy Rossum) awakens our own sense of impossibility as we watch Christine struggle with all that she can and can't control. Her fascination with the Phantom seems born of her love for her father, who she assumes has returned from the grave as an Angel of Music to guide her career.The sets and gold, sapphire and crimson costumes are especially magical, with cavernous labyrinths, an extremely ornate opera house in Paris and mysterious mirrors leading to worlds luminous with hundreds of candles where boats glide along underground rivers.If you loved Jean Cocteau's Orphic Trilogy and his movie: Beauty and The Beast, this has many revelations. This really does come across as an Operatic Beauty and the Beast with the Phantom's disfigured face more a situation of reality than a magical curse. This makes the story even more appealing because if Christine really does love him for who he is, she will not be finding out he is really a rich prince. Raoul seems so much less interesting and his character is not fully explored to any degree. We have no idea why Christine would be romantically interested except that he seems to have known her when she was a child and they have shared memories.While Gerard Butler is the dark sexy strength in the movie, Emmy Rossum presents the beautiful luminous innocence as she struggles with her emotions and comes to terms with what she truly wants out of life. Every time Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum appear together in this movie I was completely fascinated by the story and Emmy looked even more beautiful in the presence of Gerard Butler.

I think Joel Schumacher's film is fine on many levels, especially his sense of period detail. The sets & costumes were magnificent. Also magnificent is the lovely Emmy Rossum (I remember her lovely performance in a little indie called ""Songcatcher""). The rest of the cast was fine. The finest moment has to be Rossum's ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"", alone in the graveyard, one of the only really peaceful moments. Gerard Butler was fine, and Patrick Wilson sang beautifully. One thing that often bothers me in films like this is why some characters speak with accents (Minnie Driver) and most of the others don't.

Andrew Llyod Webber writes the greatest music and every song adds depth and emotion into the movie. And if you actually PAYED ATTENTION to the movie's interesting plot, you would realize that there's a very important reason for everything done in the movie.Some people claim that Gerard Butler is a bad phantom. I don't understand why they would think this. His acting abilities are supurb and you really feel for him and learn to love his character. Butler is not a professional singer and, honestly, I thought his voice was terrible when I first saw the movie. However, when I watched it the second time, I realized that he really wasn't a bad singer, he just doesn't have a traditional opera voice. But it's kind of a good thing because his voice adds to the pahntom character.Emmy and Patrick did excellent as their characters. Minnie Driver was hilarious! And she sings a wondeful song at the end.

Emmy Rossum for being such a young actress did very well and I thought that her singing voice was very refreshing.

In fact, I almost didn't buy the movie when I heard Sarah Brightman was not the star. It seemed to me that Mr Webber should not even consider anyone else at this point in time.On the Bonus Disc we are told that Sarah Brightman turned down the role. At first I thought it might be because of her age. Then I realized that she probably has enough money to buy her own country and a concert schedule that would surely kill any normal person. I was wrong on all counts - Ms Brightman is not only the most loved woman in the world, with every great quality you could ask for in a woman, she is also very, very smart.I purchased this movie because of reviews about how great the sets were. Actually, the sets are the most beautiful I have ever seen in any movie. That's where it ends.The story has been changed a bit but the real problem is the movie has nothing to offer. The young female lead is pleasant to look at with a good voice. I also discovered that Minnie Driver is actually a very talented actress. Other than the points I have mentioned, the movie is only average. I have played this movie on my large screen TV many times and it has put me to sleep on every attempt to view it. The last time I watched it in 15 minute sections.At no point could I find an interest in the actors, the characters, or the story, and certainly not the music. I find it hard to believe that so much beauty has gone into a movie that offers so little. However, there is a bright spot. Buy the two disc version. The Bonus disc makes the package worthwhile.

By the play/movie/book that preceded it?I think not.The play was significantly different than the book and previous film versions but few complained.Let's judge the movie for itself:1) I love the camera work.  We the viewers are offered the opportunity of giddily flying through the opera house time and time again.  I love the scenes backstage and the many flickering gas flames.  I love the fluid movement during the scene where Carlotta gets into her pink dress - it floats down upon her.2) The movie works BECAUSE the Phantom is, well, hot.  His age is in his favor (he COULD be Christine's father as opposed to her grandfather).  As well, his appeal creates a convincing tension for Christine and we the viewer can understand her inner turmoil.  Should she run off with the handsome blond or with the dynamic stranger who is a natty dresser, has an incredible, ah, lair, and is a genius to boot?  His deformity makes him additionally appealing - one's heart goes out to him.3) The over-the-top sets are visually rich and enjoyable.4) Emmy Rossum has a SUPERIOR voice and is enchanting to look at.  Compare her voice - and the excellent pacing of her songs - with the play soundtrack.  I know this is heresy but Rossum is better.  Sorry fans.5) The orchestra is much larger and as such richer.6) Gerard Butler is, as mentioned, a very sexy Phantom.  His voice, while not opera quality is nonetheless powerful, deep, and commanding - a perfect Phantom voice.  After watching the movie several times, Michael Crawford (I know this is heresy) sounds like a teenager on the play soundtrack.  Sorry fans.7) Is the movie perfect?  No.  The sword fight is absurd and unnecessary.  The fall of the chandelier should have been better (watch Disk II for a better scene of the infamous fall!).8) All the versions of Phantom suffer from the following but few if any have commented: each of Christine's suitors treats her like an object and a child.

The graveyard ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" scene is one of the most visually stunning; however, with so much of Ms. Rossum's cleavage exposed, during what was a rather wintry scene, the actress seemed noticeably unaffected. BRRRR. The same was true with her and Raouls roof top duet. And how could the Phantom lose in a duel of swords to Raoul? Kind of takes away from the mystique of his character. One of the more spectacular numbers, ""Masquerade"" was somewhat over choreographed, rather than the more free spirited stage productions. Each actor seemed ""rehearsed and ready"" for their big closeup. And the choice of black-and-white costumes for that scene left much to be desired over the colorful originals. Dull even. We could  also have done without the flashbacks of the Phantom's dreary childhood.There were some strong supporting cast performances, namely Minnie Driver as Carlotta, though her singing was dubbed. Overall, an average film  adaptation of an extremely wonderful stage musical, though beautifully photographed. Unfortunately, not uncommon with Andrew Lloyd Webber creations when transfered to film. See the stage version if you haven't already had the opportunity.

890321,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B0007TKNI8,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[3, 5]","The usual acclaim.Absolutely beautiful, inspiring, uplifting music. I had tears in my eyes within the first 15 minutes. I've appreciated A.L.Webber's music since JC-SuperStar, this along with Evita are showcases for his technique. But i'm not really interested in music, i dwell on ideas.From the top it is the battle of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, Heaven and Hell. big deal, lots of movies and great amounts of literature are about this theme.What is fascinating about PotO is how it leads into what we find persuasive and compelling.Good has no character development, it seems almost absurd to think that Christine would choose the calvary officer. He is just a pretty boy from her pre-opera days.It is only the character of evil that is developed, and he grows as he teaches and shapes his progeny, the beautiful young virginal white untouched untested unknown singer.Evil is talented, busy (just lighting all those candles, to say nothing of moving the huge pipe organ into the catacombs and teaching himself how to play and write music for it) a genius with just a little baggage. Evil is seductive, Christine is forgiven for loving him since he goes to her at night, in her dreams. Evil is in control, dictating conditions to the owners of the opera house, demanding a weekly salary, possibly the real author of all the great pieces performed there. Evil is of course, defective, but it is not his fault, he was born that way and mistreated until he snapped. His outrage at mistreatment, his hatred of the world above is understandable and forgivable. Not a critical character fault, but a birth defect. His ugliness, his face is repulsive but people's response to it explains and excuses the stain of evil on his soul. His genius, his musical talent, his moody and provocative music is the good result of his brooding on evil and his alienation from the rest of mankind. It is not that evil chooses to wallow in sin, but that sin is unjustifiably forced on a young boy who just responses as we all would. He is excused.As modern people we find this persuasive, we find it beautiful as the female voice intertwines and weaves just above the deeper male voice. The music's point and counterpoint dance just asEvil wanted their bodies to dance and intertwine on his swan bed. But he wanted to seduce her, a willing mate, not to rape her. With his voice, with his talent, with his music he wanted to substitute for the face that repelled her, to attract her soul, her beautiful heavenly voice to his underground grotto leaving the naturally lighted world and her potential good lover on the roof. Neat stuff, things we identify with, things we see internally and would dearly love to be seduced by ourselves.This is what i personally find so interesting, the compellingness of the vision, that evil is beautiful, that inspiring music is gorgous despite or even best of it's origin in pain. That talent, that genius no matter how twisted, no matter how murderous is a value to be sought after. It is not really a battle of Good and Evil, for good is simply palid and uninteresting compared to evil, is is a battle to yield to evil, be be allow to submit without loosing innocence. How to be that beautiful virgin in white after spending the night below, the morning after untouched by evil itself just wrapped up in the beauty of it's genius, and that is excusible. She pities evil, she overcomes her repulsion of his mask off, she recognizes not just the beauty of his music, the debt that her gifts owe to him, but most of all she knows that even though she outwardly chooses good (raises a family with him) evil will always return to her in her dreams. and in her music. for no one recognized or tried to develop her gifts but evil did, she owes him all her voice and her success.nice, literary, complex, beautiful. the best of art.it is a window into our souls and what we find persuasive as evil and the battles it plays in our lives",5,a window into our souls,1115596800,"05 9, 2005",2005,3947,"['usual', 'acclaim.Absolutely', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'uplifting', 'music', 'had', 'tears', 'eyes', 'first', '15', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'appreciated', 'A.L.Webber', 'music', 'JC-SuperStar', 'Evita', 'are', 'showcases', 'technique', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'interested', 'music', 'i', 'dwell', 'top', 'battle', 'Good', 'Evil', 'Light', 'Darkness', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'big', 'deal', 'lots', 'movies', 'great', 'amounts', 'literature', 'are', 'theme.What', 'fascinating', 'PotO', 'how', 'what', 'find', 'persuasive', 'compelling.Good', 'character', 'development', 'almost', 'absurd', 'think', 'Christine', 'would', 'choose', 'calvary', 'officer', 'just', 'pretty', 'boy', 'pre-opera', 'days.It', 'only', 'character', 'evil', 'developed', 'progeny', 'beautiful', 'young', 'virginal', 'white', 'untouched', 'untested', 'unknown', 'singer.Evil', 'talented', 'busy', 'just', 'lighting', 'candles', 'say', 'nothing', 'moving', 'huge', 'pipe', 'organ', 'catacombs', 'teaching', 'how', 'play', 'write', 'music', 'genius', 'just', 'little', 'baggage', 'Evil', 'seductive', 'Christine', 'forgiven', 'loving', 'night', 'dreams', 'Evil', 'control', 'dictating', 'conditions', 'owners', 'opera', 'house', 'demanding', 'weekly', 'salary', 'possibly', 'real', 'author', 'great', 'pieces', 'performed', 'there', 'Evil', 'course', 'defective', 'not', 'fault', 'was', 'born', 'way', 'mistreated', 'snapped', 'outrage', 'mistreatment', 'hatred', 'world', 'above', 'understandable', 'forgivable', 'Not', 'critical', 'character', 'fault', 'birth', 'defect', 'ugliness', 'face', 'repulsive', 'people', 'response', 'stain', 'evil', 'soul', 'genius', 'musical', 'talent', 'moody', 'provocative', 'music', 'good', 'result', 'brooding', 'evil', 'alienation', 'rest', 'mankind', 'not', 'evil', 'chooses', 'wallow', 'sin', 'sin', 'unjustifiably', 'forced', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'responses', 'would', 'excused.As', 'modern', 'people', 'find', 'persuasive', 'find', 'beautiful', 'female', 'voice', 'intertwines', 'weaves', 'just', 'deeper', 'male', 'voice', 'music', 'point', 'counterpoint', 'dance', 'just', 'asEvil', 'wanted', 'bodies', 'dance', 'intertwine', 'swan', 'bed', 'wanted', 'seduce', 'willing', 'mate', 'not', 'rape', 'voice', 'talent', 'music', 'wanted', 'substitute', 'face', 'repelled', 'attract', 'soul', 'beautiful', 'heavenly', 'voice', 'underground', 'grotto', 'leaving', 'naturally', 'lighted', 'world', 'potential', 'good', 'lover', 'roof', 'Neat', 'stuff', 'things', 'identify', 'things', 'see', 'internally', 'would', 'dearly', 'love', 'be', 'seduced', 'ourselves.This', 'what', 'i', 'personally', 'find', 'so', 'interesting', 'compellingness', 'vision', 'evil', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'music', 'gorgous', 'even', 'best', 'origin', 'pain', 'talent', 'matter', 'how', 'twisted', 'matter', 'how', 'murderous', 'value', 'be', 'sought', 'not', 'really', 'battle', 'Good', 'Evil', 'good', 'simply', 'palid', 'uninteresting', 'compared', 'evil', 'battle', 'yield', 'evil', 'be', 'be', 'allow', 'submit', 'loosing', 'innocence', 'How', 'be', 'beautiful', 'virgin', 'white', 'spending', 'night', 'morning', 'untouched', 'evil', 'just', 'wrapped', 'up', 'beauty', 'genius', 'excusible', 'evil', 'repulsion', 'mask', 'off', 'not', 'just', 'beauty', 'music', 'debt', 'gifts', 'owe', 'most', 'even', 'outwardly', 'good', 'family', 'evil', 'will', 'always', 'return', 'dreams', 'music', 'one', 'recognized', 'tried', 'develop', 'gifts', 'evil', 'did', 'voice', 'success.nice', 'literary', 'complex', 'beautiful', 'best', 'art.it', 'window', 'souls', 'what', 'find', 'persuasive', 'evil', 'battles', 'lives']",N/A

The story retains much of its magic in the ALW version:  the lonely misfit of talent, pursuing his art and mixing it with love, and becoming an insane murderer to realize his visions.  Then there is the brilliant ingenue and her chance at love as well as an entrance to the proper society, whose tragic origins lend her a natural sympathy for the misfit, who is helping her career.  SHe must choose, in a way, between artistic excellence with much insanity and life.My daughter had very interesting criticisms.  First, the story is rather rarified.  This ALW couldn't change, so he did a good job at romanticizing it in spite of this limitation.  Second, while the music is very nice, it is rather repetitive, essentially the same melody through just about every song.  When I listened carefully, I realized this is true.  Third, two of the singers - the Phantom and the Aristocrat love interest - are both mediocre singers and not very good actors.  Even I, with my less trained ear, would cringe every time the Phantom sang.  It is the biggest failing of the production.That being said, there are many things that work in the production.  The ingenue is really excellent and has a wonderful singing voice.  She is a first rate talent, it would appear.  The set is also very well done, with the Paris Opera in the belle epoque.  Though repetitive, the music is beautiful and has stuck in my head.

What was done well can almost entirely be traced back to Webber and the stage production.  The music is there in all of its pop majesty as are the flowing costumes and set pieces.  That was enough to make the show a worldwide sensation.  Why did the filmmakers feel that more was needed?The movie opens with, and is interspersed with flash forwards and flash backs that undercut, not enhance the story.  Why give the origin of the phantom?  To make him more human?  He isn't supposed to be human.  He is supposed to be the embodiment of music; one that demands devotion and love from those whom he seeks out.  He is a jealous force that would kill anything that interferes with his disciple's complete dedication.  He is not a circus freak.I also disagree with the symbolic use of a clockwork monkey music box.  It was used in this movie much like the ""Rosebud"" sled was used in Citizen Kane.  But by focusing on this symbol, the true icon of the show - the phantom's white half mask - was reduced to a costume piece.Finally, the movie ends at Christine's grave.  What purpose does this serve?  Aside from a date and a title, we know nothing more of Christine than we did when she was ""saved"" by Raoul in the catacombs.  Did she continue with her musical gifts?  Why or why not?  Raoul leaves the monkey music box with her - but it wasn't hers and she barely interacted with it.  Is this Raoul's way of returning the phantom to her?  How did he know that it was the phantom's music box and not some random prop?It would have been a better movie - and better served the source material - if they would have just stuck to the stage show.

So don't bewail the fact that this isn't a filmed version of Hal Prince's fine production - that kind of thing never really works anyway. This a new vision and an opulent, grand and beautiful one that manages to maintain the over the top romanticism that makes Phantom such an icon of the musical in our time.

And you probably assume I do not watch musicals but trust me I have seen a few musicals and a few of them were a lot more entertaining than this one. This is the show so widely praised all this time? Please, the story is by itself interesting enough to watch once, but the way it is played out, no catch that, dragged out, was boring, cheesy, and overdramatic. I mean I'm not a huge fan of musicals anyway but nonetheless I have enjoyed a few and this was not one of them. I just wanted to watch the Phantom because well I assumed if all these people kept saying it was wonderful it must have been. A common mistake I hate making.My friend says that the old one is different and I really hope so because getting to the end of this movie was exhausting. They just would not stop singing about every single thing and what would be a normal five minute conversation they made like ten minutes longer by singing it out and that is why the movie felt like it was being dragged out so slowly...I don't know, it just certainly was not an interesting movie to me nor entertaining. I found myself and my friend laughing at this movie more than anything, and also rewinding through a lot of the what we considered unnecessary singing.Why you wonder, if you're still reading this instead of angrily going on to another post possible Phantom fan, did I not so harshly give it a one star instead of an actual two star review? Well there was one thing I absolutely loved in this movie that unfortunately couldn't save the film but nonetheless kept me till the end and that was indeed the picture itself. The movie itself, the setting and the costumes, were gorgeous and I thought almost every scene in the movie was magical and lovely by sight. I loved looking at the movie definitely. But hearing it, and trying to keep interest in it throughout the long painful process of their constant prolonged singing, was too much. I don't think I could ever watch that story again, I don't care if there were other versions of the story, this movie just killed my interest in the Phantom plot.I watched it once out of curiosity and I think that's it for the Phantom and I.

890333,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0007TKNI8,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","""Opulent"" is the defining term for ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" Joel Schumacher's lavish film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber mega stage hit from the 1980`s.  Based on the novel by Gaston Leroux, the film tells the story of a mysterious, masked specter, his face disfigured from birth, who haunts a Paris opera house in the 1870's.  Embittered by the treatment he's received all his life from a callous, cruel society that could never see past his physical deformity, the Phantom lives an isolated, lonely existence in the rafters and bowels of the theater until he falls in love with a beautiful young ing&eacute;nue named Christine whom he both inspires and terrifies with his actions and demeanor.The original production relied heavily on feats of stagecraft and theatrical legerdemain - the boat rowing across the stage, the chandelier crashing to the floor - to wow its awestruck audience.  Since such special effects are de rigueur in the world of film, Schumacher has had to retain much of the theatricality of the original to make these moments work as well here as they did on the stage.  This he achieves through the use of elaborate, larger-than-life sets - soaring architecture for the scenes above stage and cavernous causeways for the ones below.  Yet, Schumacher keeps it all reasonably cinematic through fluid camerawork and an occasional excursion into the great outdoors.Like most musicals, ""Phantom"" rises or falls on the quality of its score.  Although many have noted that the songs all tend to sound the same after awhile, this criticism does an injustice to some of the really stirring melodies Webber has come up with.  Although a few of the pieces do, indeed, feel like filler, the music, on the whole, perfectly captures the high flown romanticism of what is, let's face it, a pretty florid piece of Victorian melodrama at its core.  Needless to say, the songs are impeccably sung, with Emmy Rossum's clear, shining soprano a thing of beauty.  Gerald Butler as the Phantom and Patrick Wilson as Raoul, his rival for Christine's affections, both lack charisma as actors, although Butler has a few touching moments at the end (Wilson, on the other hand, has been stuck playing one of those bland, white bread hero types Victorian audiences seemed to adore so much, so, unlike Butler, he has little or no chance of redeeming himself at any point in the movie).",4,impressively mounted adaptation,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,2385,"['Opulent', 'defining', 'term', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'lavish', 'film', 'version', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'mega', 'stage', 'hit', '1980', 's', 'Based', 'novel', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', 'film', 'story', 'mysterious', 'masked', 'specter', 'face', 'disfigured', 'birth', 'who', 'Paris', 'opera', 'house', '1870', 'Embittered', 'treatment', 'received', 'life', 'callous', 'cruel', 'society', 'could', 'never', 'see', 'physical', 'deformity', 'Phantom', 'isolated', 'lonely', 'existence', 'rafters', 'bowels', 'theater', 'love', 'beautiful', 'young', 'ing', 'eacute', 'named', 'Christine', 'whom', 'inspires', 'terrifies', 'actions', 'demeanor.The', 'original', 'production', 'relied', 'heavily', 'feats', 'stagecraft', 'theatrical', 'legerdemain', 'boat', 'rowing', 'stage', 'chandelier', 'crashing', 'floor', 'wow', 'awestruck', 'audience', 'such', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'de', 'rigueur', 'world', 'film', 'Schumacher', 'had', 'retain', 'much', 'theatricality', 'original', 'make', 'moments', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'here', 'did', 'stage', 'use', 'elaborate', 'larger-than-life', 'sets', 'soaring', 'architecture', 'scenes', 'stage', 'cavernous', 'causeways', 'ones', 'Schumacher', 'reasonably', 'cinematic', 'fluid', 'camerawork', 'occasional', 'excursion', 'great', 'outdoors.Like', 'most', 'musicals', 'Phantom', 'quality', 'score', 'many', 'have', 'noted', 'songs', 'tend', 'sound', 'same', 'awhile', 'criticism', 'injustice', 'really', 'stirring', 'melodies', 'Webber', 'come', 'up', 'few', 'pieces', 'do', 'indeed', 'feel', 'filler', 'music', 'whole', 'perfectly', 'high', 'flown', 'romanticism', 'what', 'let', 'face', 'pretty', 'florid', 'piece', 'Victorian', 'melodrama', 'core', 'Needless', 'say', 'songs', 'are', 'impeccably', 'sung', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'clear', 'shining', 'soprano', 'thing', 'beauty', 'Gerald', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Raoul', 'rival', 'Christine', 'affections', 'lack', 'charisma', 'actors', 'Butler', 'few', 'touching', 'moments', 'end', 'Wilson', 'other', 'hand', 'been', 'stuck', 'playing', 'one', 'bland', 'white', 'bread', 'hero', 'types', 'Victorian', 'audiences', 'seemed', 'adore', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'Butler', 'little', 'chance', 'redeeming', 'point', 'movie']",N/A

Tan,"[4, 6]","If THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA had been made before Moulin Rouge or Chicago it would have been more deserving Oscars awards.With so many memorable songs, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is Andrew Lloyd Webber's best work by far. Since Phantom, however, his musicals Sunset Boulevard, The Beautiful Game, and most recently, The Woman in White, have been less then memorable; you can hardly recall a humable tune.THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a beautifully made film and it is sure to stand the test of time. Of course, it would have been wonderful to have Michael Crawford star as the Phantom, but no point crying over split milk. Gerard Bulter is a great alternative choice and he has added a certain sexual tension that I haven't seen in other Phantoms. However, I think most would agree with me, if the Phantom is so attractive like Gerard why would Christine go for Raul?Butler's recording is adequate but I did find myself holding my breath when he reached his high notes and that does distract me from the film. As for the female lead Emmy Rossum, she was an understandable choice.  As much as I like Sarah Brightman's voice, the part is for a much younger actress, especially when one's face is magnified so many times on the screen. I read in an interview that Emmy said she was too big for the small screen ( TV ) . She did look good on the big screen and she can sing too. Both Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry and Minnie Driver as Carlotta were perfectly cast. ( I am only disappointed that they gave Minnie the chance to sing the new added song at the Oscars. But that's show business for you ).At the opening of the film, when the stagelights came up and the first few bars are played, I hadn't felt so excited in a long time. Joel Schumacher did a fantastic job in directing this film . It is beautifully made and my only complaint is Phantom's face (  his scars ) is not very consistence.I hope this film will not discourage film makers from investing in more musical films such as Sunset Boulevard. But this time please use one of the star from the musical. In this case, Glen Close, is the perfect `Norma'. She was acclaimed for the role, and while a little young perhaps, she is bankable and she has the voice.I will be watching THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, the film, again and again.

890342,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,B0007TKNI8,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[5, 6]","Joel Schumacher's film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's most famous musical, Phantom Of The Opera, is in theatres now and deserves Oscar recognition. It is without a doubt an incredibly powerful movie. It packs a visual splendor, beautiful musical score and emotional ride that so few films do. To many, mistakingly, this film is only a ""movie musical"" or overdone, lavish nonsense. It's not. I have seen this movie several times and each time, there is magic  to be noted in every detail. First of all, one must seperate themselves entirely from the Lloyd Webber stage musical, which first appeared on Broadway back in 1986. Sarah Brightman starred as Christine and Michael Crawford as the Phantom. THIS IS NOT THAT VERSION. While to many that is the ultimate and musically, it is superior, this one, starring Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler, is a glorious modern, youth-oriented ""movement"" towards the performing arts as cinema.It uses the latest in visual effects and sound to make a musical much more than a musical. It becomes a powerful, striking emotional romantic tragedy with theatrical roots.Seeing this film has made me appreciate the musical as well as the cinema with historical/musical background. Lloyd Webber has already used cinema to promote his staged Broadway shows- the first being 1974's Jesus Christ Superstar. Schumacher captures the real Phantom of the Opera in its essence. There are things that movies can do that staged plays or musicals, operas, can never do. Subtle things reveal powerful symbols or emotions. In this movie, it's a portrait of a tragic figure- the Phantom. Born a freak, showcased shamelessly in a circus which results in his father's suicide, the Phantom is rescued by the kind-hearted Madame Giry, the ballet instructor, who hides him under the Paris Opera house. He lives isolated in the deep caverns by the lake under the theatre, listening to opera and music his whole life. He develops creative talent for composing music himself. Anonymously, he trains Christine to sing his music. Eventually, when Christine is a star, he falls in love with her, though there is a teacher-student relationship in the center of it. Through Christine, he is a better man and less a monster. She makes him feel love and the warmth of human kindness. Through her singing, the world hears his soul, which is both passionate, intense, painful, romantic, sensitive and bitter. Christine is in love with Raol, a young aristocrat who was a childhood friend. The fact that at the end, even after a scary attempt of keeping her for himself, the Phantom releases Christine and allows her to marry Raol, shows how much his love for her has changed him. This is one of the most moving romances I have ever seen, though it shares in that same theme with another French novel, Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame and even slight elements of Beauty and the Beast.Visually, this movie is unsurpassed. It's likely it will win Oscars for Best Costumes or Best Song (Minni Driver's own song ""Learn To Be Lonely""). The use of computer graphics and original sets to imitate the Garnier Paris Opera is exquisite. The chandelier, the rose, the Phantom's mask, the toy monkey, are all powerful romantic symbols. The acting is top-notch. We have here Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, totally devoting herself to the role. Gerard Butler's Phantom carries most of the weight. He is as powerful and frightening as he is tender and vulnerable. We see through his ""shrine to Christine"" that he is obscessed with her. We see through Christine's facial expressions that she is probably more in love with the Phantom than with Raol, but being a public figure, or wanting children (she becomes a mother) she cannot live a happy, normal life with an ostracized figure like the Phantom. The cinematic treatment of using black and white as the present day for the older Phantom who has outlived Christine and is remembering in full color memory all the events of the story is wonderful.Emmy Rossum as Christine is a treat. Her light voice pales in comparison to the more dramatic-lyric, bigger voice of Sarah Brightman, but Rossum holds her own. She was educated in opera at the Metoropolitan Opera Chorus in New York City with Eleanor Doria, who still instructs young children and young adults in the world of opera. Though she is essentially a lyric coloratura, she can deliver a powerful performance charged with raw emotion. Minnie Driver as the stereotypical bitchy, arrogant and bossy diva Carlotta is a riot. She gets a lot of laughs. Her voice is dubbed by a different singer whose own dramatic, Maria Callas type voice is used for comic effect. This movie has everything. It's both light and dark, funny and tragic, powerful in its melancholy beauty and will haunt you years afterward, casting a spell of enchantment that so many few films do today.",5,The Phantom Will Win Your Heart,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,4863,"['Joel', 'Schumacher', 'film', 'version', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'most', 'famous', 'musical', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'theatres', 'now', 'Oscar', 'recognition', 'doubt', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'movie', 'visual', 'splendor', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score', 'emotional', 'ride', 'so', 'few', 'films', 'do', 'many', 'mistakingly', 'film', 'only', 'movie', 'musical', 'overdone', 'lavish', 'nonsense', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'time', 'magic', 'be', 'noted', 'detail', 'First', 'one', 'must', 'seperate', 'entirely', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'stage', 'musical', 'first', 'appeared', 'Broadway', 'back', '1986', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'starred', 'Christine', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'Phantom', 'THIS', 'NOT', 'THAT', 'VERSION', 'many', 'ultimate', 'musically', 'superior', 'one', 'starring', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'glorious', 'modern', 'youth-oriented', 'movement', 'performing', 'arts', 'cinema.It', 'latest', 'visual', 'effects', 'sound', 'make', 'musical', 'much', 'more', 'musical', 'powerful', 'striking', 'emotional', 'romantic', 'tragedy', 'theatrical', 'roots.Seeing', 'film', 'made', 'appreciate', 'musical', 'as', 'well', 'cinema', 'historical/musical', 'background', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'already', 'used', 'cinema', 'promote', 'staged', 'Broadway', 'shows-', 'first', 'being', '1974', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'Schumacher', 'real', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'essence', 'are', 'things', 'movies', 'can', 'do', 'staged', 'plays', 'musicals', 'operas', 'can', 'never', 'do', 'Subtle', 'things', 'reveal', 'powerful', 'symbols', 'emotions', 'movie', 'portrait', 'tragic', 'figure-', 'Phantom', 'Born', 'freak', 'showcased', 'shamelessly', 'circus', 'results', 'father', 'suicide', 'Phantom', 'rescued', 'kind-hearted', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'ballet', 'instructor', 'who', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'house', 'isolated', 'deep', 'caverns', 'lake', 'theatre', 'listening', 'opera', 'music', 'whole', 'life', 'creative', 'talent', 'composing', 'music', 'Anonymously', 'Christine', 'sing', 'music', 'Eventually', 'when', 'Christine', 'star', 'love', 'teacher-student', 'relationship', 'center', 'Christine', 'better', 'man', 'less', 'monster', 'feel', 'love', 'warmth', 'human', 'kindness', 'singing', 'world', 'soul', 'passionate', 'intense', 'painful', 'romantic', 'sensitive', 'bitter', 'Christine', 'love', 'Raol', 'young', 'aristocrat', 'who', 'was', 'childhood', 'friend', 'fact', 'end', 'even', 'scary', 'attempt', 'keeping', 'Phantom', 'Christine', 'marry', 'Raol', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'changed', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'romances', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'shares', 'same', 'theme', 'French', 'novel', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'even', 'slight', 'elements', 'Beauty', 'Beast.Visually', 'movie', 'unsurpassed', 'likely', 'will', 'win', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Costumes', 'Best', 'Song', 'Minni', 'Driver', 'own', 'song', 'Learn', 'Be', 'Lonely', 'use', 'computer', 'graphics', 'original', 'sets', 'imitate', 'Garnier', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'exquisite', 'chandelier', 'rose', 'Phantom', 'mask', 'toy', 'monkey', 'are', 'powerful', 'romantic', 'symbols', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'have', 'here', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'totally', 'devoting', 'role', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'most', 'weight', 'powerful', 'frightening', 'tender', 'vulnerable', 'see', 'shrine', 'Christine', 'obscessed', 'see', 'Christine', 'facial', 'expressions', 'probably', 'more', 'love', 'Phantom', 'Raol', 'being', 'public', 'figure', 'wanting', 'children', 'mother', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'happy', 'normal', 'life', 'ostracized', 'figure', 'Phantom', 'cinematic', 'treatment', 'using', 'black', 'white', 'present', 'day', 'older', 'Phantom', 'who', 'outlived', 'Christine', 'remembering', 'full', 'color', 'memory', 'events', 'story', 'wonderful.Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Christine', 'treat', 'light', 'voice', 'pales', 'comparison', 'more', 'dramatic-lyric', 'bigger', 'voice', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Rossum', 'own', 'was', 'educated', 'opera', 'Metoropolitan', 'Opera', 'Chorus', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Eleanor', 'Doria', 'who', 'still', 'young', 'children', 'young', 'adults', 'world', 'opera', 'essentially', 'lyric', 'coloratura', 'can', 'deliver', 'powerful', 'performance', 'charged', 'raw', 'emotion', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'stereotypical', 'bitchy', 'arrogant', 'bossy', 'diva', 'Carlotta', 'riot', 'lot', 'laughs', 'voice', 'dubbed', 'different', 'singer', 'own', 'dramatic', 'Maria', 'Callas', 'type', 'voice', 'used', 'comic', 'effect', 'movie', 'everything', 'light', 'dark', 'funny', 'tragic', 'powerful', 'melancholy', 'beauty', 'will', 'haunt', 'years', 'afterward', 'casting', 'spell', 'enchantment', 'so', 'many', 'few', 'films', 'do', 'today']",N/A

My mom owns the tape of the original stage version with Crawford as the Phantom, yet I hadn't heard this amazing music before now.I'll basically explain the story in modern day terms: a deformed man trains a young girl to sing beautifully, then falls in love with her.  Then she basically gives him a one night stand in his lair and runs off to marry Raul, her childhood sweetheart.  The Phantom was the real victim of this film, no matter how evil and disturbing he acts.  Gerard Butler, who was in a rock band and starred in smaller roles, brings the Phantom alive in this film.  In my personal opinion, he does a better job of portraying The Phantom then Michael Crawford did.  His singing may not be great, but it's the emotion in his voice that will literally hypnotize you.  You feel the tremble in his voice when he's sad, the anger when he's enraged, and the romance when he's sensually trying to whoo Christine.  Speaking of her, Emma Rossum gives a great performance as the star of the opera.  Her voice is amazingly beautiful.  Raul was the one I hated most in this film.  While his voice is amazing, the character seems like an arrogant punk compared to the more adult Phantom.The film itself left me speechless all the way through.

890350,A61WRN3Y04WU8,B0007TKNI8,"Ryan L. ""Ryan Lattanzio""","[0, 4]","I count myself as an obsessive ""phan"" of the original stage production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's lavish musical The Phantom of the Opera. In fact, since I was about four years old. It's grand, over-the-top, whimsical, dark, magical, and glorious all at once. To capture this on the cinema screen is understandably a very difficult task, especially for mediocre director Joel Schumacher, who has steered the project in a theatrical direction--but his dark, dense visual style can still be seen (you'll find some similar photography in this and even the later two Batman films). This film has been hyped for over a decade, so does it live up to its expectations?Yes and no.The Phantom is obviously a film that bluntly overreaches to redeem award-worthy success. But that's sort of what I liked about it. The whole film is over the top and extravagent like Webber's original version--and since he was on the wagon for this film, too, it essentially works. I noticed that writers Schumacher and Webber played around with the chronology of the story, too, adding some elements, changing the scene where the chandelier falls (quite successfully it is one of the best scenes I've watched all year). All of this kind of reforms, in some way, the minor shortcomings of the stage Opera. Here's the problem, though: none of it seems to fit in the limited aspect of movies. It's less open, and many of the musical numbers, while candidly well flowing, seem almost too claustrophobic. Does that detract from the overall viewing experience? Not a whole lot.To briefly sum up the story, we begin with an opera house. Numerous operas are performed by the company, and they are grand, beautiful. But the skulking Opera Ghost (or the Phantom) lives in the shadows of the opera house, deep below the floors in a creepy lair. He has haunted it, and exploits its people because of his scars--not just emotionally, but physically. What he's hiding under the mask is rather hideous (although the silent picture Phantom was scarier). Not only does he reign over the operas, but he comes as the angel of music for chorus girl Christine Daae (the beautiful Emmy Rossum from Mystic River), who is in love with Raoul (Patrick Wilson), a former childhood sweetheart. Her voice is beautiful, and stirs within the Phantom (Gerald Butler) to the point of no return, where he takes on an almost stalker-like persona.All of the supporting players, including Miranda Richardson and the surprisingly scene-stealing Minnie Driver as soprano LaCarlotta, are well cast. It is the two leads that had me worried, Butler more so. I doubted Rossum in the film's first stretch, but by the second act she had me convinced. She seems a bit young for the part, and almost too nimble and innocent. Her voice is great, but it doesn't seem to really fit for the naive character that was written. I still see her performance as lovely, but nothing Oscar worthy. There is too little dialogue and not enough conversation to give any of these actors a lead in the Oscar race.Gerald Butler is a frank miscast for the Phantom. His tenor vocals feel strained, and he doesn't really give off the impression that he can inhabit the skin of the character--or the capacity of the character's creepinees. Butler seems too sorta-hunky and young (I see the Phantom as someone around 50 years old) to be taken seriously.In fact, some of the film is difficult to be taken seriously. Schumacher almost seems intimidated by the complex balance of narratives and genre that The Phantom incorporates--the comedy/farce versus dark, dramatic moments seems campy. The flashbacks, forwards, whatever you want to call them, were interesting but I was more fascinated by the numerous production numbers. The blocking and the choreography is never awkward or clumsy. That's where the movie is so precise because it focuses much on the little details of the original story. Its also so well shot I could hardly keep my eyes from examining the lighting around the characters (two cases in point--the Masquerade and the swordfight in the cemetary were brilliant and what you might see on the stage). For its visual sense, I'll give it credit.The film is best to be described as a myriad of swirling pretty pictures and angelic music. Chills ran down my spine so many times I lost count, mostly because I love the songs. Superficially, its great escapist material, but if you look between the lines, and between the technical wonder of it all, there are some problems. All in all, if you look at it, the whole show's a beaut. I give it this verdict because I love the stage production so much that no film could ever rival it, but I'll give this Opera credit for trying.",3,Disappointing Phantom that doesn't live up to the hype,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,4688,"['count', 'obsessive', 'phan', 'original', 'stage', 'production', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'lavish', 'musical', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'fact', 'was', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'grand', 'over-the-top', 'whimsical', 'dark', 'magical', 'glorious', 'once', 'capture', 'cinema', 'screen', 'understandably', 'very', 'difficult', 'task', 'especially', 'mediocre', 'director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'who', 'steered', 'project', 'theatrical', 'direction', 'dark', 'dense', 'visual', 'style', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'seen', ""'ll"", 'find', 'similar', 'photography', 'even', 'later', 'two', 'Batman', 'films', 'film', 'been', 'hyped', 'decade', 'so', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'Yes', 'no.The', 'Phantom', 'obviously', 'film', 'bluntly', 'redeem', 'award-worthy', 'success', 'sort', 'what', 'liked', 'whole', 'film', 'top', 'extravagent', 'Webber', 'original', 'version', 'was', 'wagon', 'film', 'too', 'essentially', 'noticed', 'writers', 'Schumacher', 'Webber', 'played', 'around', 'chronology', 'story', 'too', 'adding', 'elements', 'changing', 'scene', 'where', 'chandelier', 'quite', 'successfully', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'year', 'kind', 'reforms', 'way', 'minor', 'shortcomings', 'stage', 'Opera', 'Here', 'problem', 'none', 'fit', 'limited', 'aspect', 'movies', 'less', 'open', 'many', 'musical', 'numbers', 'candidly', 'well', 'flowing', 'seem', 'almost', 'too', 'claustrophobic', 'detract', 'overall', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Not', 'whole', 'lot.To', 'briefly', 'sum', 'up', 'story', 'begin', 'opera', 'house', 'Numerous', 'operas', 'are', 'performed', 'company', 'are', 'grand', 'beautiful', 'skulking', 'Opera', 'Ghost', 'Phantom', 'shadows', 'opera', 'house', 'deep', 'floors', 'creepy', 'lair', 'haunted', 'people', 'scars', 'not', 'just', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'What', 'hiding', 'mask', 'rather', 'hideous', 'silent', 'picture', 'Phantom', 'was', 'scarier', 'Not', 'only', 'reign', 'operas', 'angel', 'music', 'chorus', 'girl', 'Christine', 'Daae', 'beautiful', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Mystic', 'River', 'who', 'love', 'Raoul', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'former', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'voice', 'beautiful', 'stirs', 'Phantom', 'Gerald', 'Butler', 'point', 'return', 'where', 'almost', 'stalker-like', 'persona.All', 'supporting', 'players', 'including', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'surprisingly', 'scene-stealing', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'soprano', 'LaCarlotta', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'two', 'leads', 'had', 'worried', 'Butler', 'more', 'so', 'doubted', 'Rossum', 'film', 'first', 'stretch', 'second', 'act', 'had', 'convinced', 'bit', 'young', 'part', 'almost', 'too', 'nimble', 'innocent', 'voice', 'great', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'fit', 'naive', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'still', 'see', 'performance', 'lovely', 'nothing', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'too', 'little', 'dialogue', 'not', 'enough', 'conversation', 'give', 'actors', 'lead', 'Oscar', 'race.Gerald', 'Butler', 'frank', 'miscast', 'Phantom', 'tenor', 'vocals', 'feel', 'strained', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'off', 'impression', 'can', 'inhabit', 'skin', 'character', 'capacity', 'character', 'creepinees', 'Butler', 'too', 'sorta-hunky', 'young', 'see', 'Phantom', 'someone', '50', 'years', 'old', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously.In', 'fact', 'film', 'difficult', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'almost', 'intimidated', 'complex', 'balance', 'narratives', 'genre', 'Phantom', 'comedy/farce', 'versus', 'dark', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'campy', 'flashbacks', 'forwards', 'want', 'call', 'were', 'interesting', 'was', 'more', 'fascinated', 'numerous', 'production', 'numbers', 'blocking', 'choreography', 'never', 'awkward', 'clumsy', 'where', 'movie', 'so', 'precise', 'much', 'little', 'details', 'original', 'story', 'also', 'so', 'well', 'shot', 'could', 'hardly', 'keep', 'eyes', 'examining', 'lighting', 'characters', 'two', 'cases', 'point', 'Masquerade', 'swordfight', 'cemetary', 'were', 'brilliant', 'what', 'might', 'see', 'stage', 'visual', 'sense', ""'ll"", 'give', 'credit.The', 'film', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'myriad', 'swirling', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'angelic', 'music', 'Chills', 'ran', 'down', 'spine', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'lost', 'count', 'mostly', 'love', 'songs', 'Superficially', 'great', 'escapist', 'material', 'look', 'lines', 'technical', 'wonder', 'are', 'problems', 'look', 'whole', 'show', 'beaut', 'give', 'verdict', 'love', 'stage', 'production', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'could', 'ever', 'rival', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Opera', 'credit', 'trying']",N/A

YOU HAD BETTER NOT MAKE ANY BIG MISTAKES.Guess what.  THEY DID.  TWO REEEEEALY BIG ONES.  other smaller ones, but I won't even mention them (the smaller mistakes wouldn't have ruined it for me).First BIG mistake:  THE 'APPEARANCE' OF THE PHANTOM.  Christine: ""Can I ever escape from that FACE so distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face . . .""  PHANTOM: ""A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing""  Me: ""HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA AAAAAAAAAAAAAH HA HA HA!""  What?  HE's a BIG SEXY HUNK.  HE's not an ugly PHANTOM.  Gerard Butler was OBVIOUSLY CAST for his LOOKS!!  Which MAKES NO SENSE: TO CAST the HORRIBLY UGLY PHANTOM by his LOOKS!!  Did you NOT SEE THE PLAY.  That was a good make up JOB!  WHY did they stray so RECKLESSLY from the ORIGINAL CONCEPT???Well, HAD TO BE good Looking because of the NEXT BIG MISTAKE . . .Second BIG mistake: THE PHANTOM'S VOICEGERARD BUTLER NEVER COULD HAVE SUNG IN ANY STAGE PRODUCTION OF PHANTOM!!!  SO WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY!![side note: a NEW CD just CAME out it's called FABULOUS BROADWAY PHANTOMS.  It features 11 . . did you get that?  ELEVAN former phantoms who ALL sound better than GERARD.]WEBER and his DIRECTOR had NO reason, NO GOOD REASON for choosing BUTLER!!  He sounds terrible.  Theres only like 4 of 5 notes he actually holds, the rest he just kind of Growlingly talk/sings.  HE is the WORST part about the movie, however he IS THE MOVIE!!!THAT is why I can not like this film.  I admit their are some good parts in it.  Some cool scenes (""Wishing you were somehow here again"") where the MUSIC and the MOVIE become one and sour and it's wonderful, but Butler isn't in any of those scenes.  The whole concept was so twisted.  Here's this big HANSOME guy trying to impress this chick with his singing and he sounds pathetic.  I'm thinking at this point:  What movie is this?  Can't be the the PHANTOM.  The PHANTOM is a an ugly guy with an BEAUTIFUL, SEDUCTIVE, POWERFUL VOICE that makes YOU (not just Christine, YOU, the audience) like him, not because he HOT, because of his VOICE.  One MOVIE REVIEW I read said it well.  HE said: ""Christine should have gotten the Oscar for being able to look like she actually was impressed with the Phantom.""For what this movie is, it is an EMBARRASSMENT!",3,"For what this movie is,  IT'S EMBARRASSING!",1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,2870,"['Alright', 'movie', 'Lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'mean', 'lot', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie.BUT', 'wish', 'was', 'terrible', 'movie', 'wish', 'was', 'reeeeeeeeealy', 'rotted', 'Why', 'HATE', 'IT', 'Why', 'just', 'enough', 'wrong', 'ruin', 'WHAT', 'IT', 'WELL', 'WHAT', 'IT', 'Film', 'version', 'one', 'GREATEST', 'MUSICAL', 'PLAYS', 'half', 'CENTURY', 'THAT', 'what', 'PLAY', 'incredible', 'IT', 'ASTOUNDING', 'well-conceived', 'well-written', 'well-produced', 'play', 'ALREADY', '4', 'stars', 'movie', 'art', 'form', 'So', 'when', 'make', 'movie', 'A', 'GREAT', 'play', 'had', 'better', 'make', 'REALY', 'WELL', 'YOU', 'HAD', 'BETTER', 'NOT', 'MAKE', 'ANY', 'BIG', 'MISTAKES.Guess', 'what', 'THEY', 'DID', 'TWO', 'REEEEEALY', 'BIG', 'ONES', 'other', 'smaller', 'ones', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'smaller', 'mistakes', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'ruined', '.First', 'BIG', 'mistake', ""'APPEARANCE"", ""'"", 'THE', 'PHANTOM', 'Christine', 'Can', 'ever', 'escape', 'FACE', 'so', 'distorted', 'deformed', 'was', 'hardly', 'face', 'PHANTOM', 'mask', 'first', 'unfeeling', 'scrap', 'clothing', 'Me', 'HA', 'HA', 'HA', 'HA', 'HA', 'HA', 'HA', 'HA', 'HA', 'HA', 'HA', 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAH', 'HA', 'HA', 'HA', 'What', 'HE', 'BIG', 'SEXY', 'HUNK', 'HE', 'not', 'ugly', 'PHANTOM', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'was', 'OBVIOUSLY', 'CAST', 'LOOKS', 'Which', 'MAKES', 'NO', 'SENSE', 'TO', 'CAST', 'HORRIBLY', 'UGLY', 'PHANTOM', 'LOOKS', 'Did', 'NOT', 'SEE', 'THE', 'PLAY', 'was', 'good', 'make', 'up', 'JOB', 'WHY', 'did', 'stray', 'so', 'RECKLESSLY', 'ORIGINAL', 'CONCEPT', 'Well', 'HAD', 'TO', 'BE', 'good', 'Looking', 'NEXT', 'BIG', 'MISTAKE', '.Second', 'BIG', 'mistake', 'PHANTOM', 'VOICEGERARD', 'BUTLER', 'NEVER', 'COULD', 'HAVE', 'SUNG', 'IN', 'ANY', 'STAGE', 'PRODUCTION', 'OF', 'PHANTOM', 'SO', 'WHY', 'WHY', 'WHY', 'WHY', 'WHY', 'WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY', '[', 'side', 'note', 'NEW', 'CD', 'just', 'CAME', 'called', 'FABULOUS', 'BROADWAY', 'PHANTOMS', '11', 'did', 'get', 'ELEVAN', 'former', 'phantoms', 'who', 'ALL', 'sound', 'better', 'GERARD', ']', 'WEBER', 'DIRECTOR', 'had', 'NO', 'reason', 'NO', 'GOOD', 'REASON', 'choosing', 'BUTLER', 'terrible', 'only', 'like', '4', '5', 'notes', 'actually', 'rest', 'just', 'kind', 'Growlingly', 'talk/sings', 'HE', 'WORST', 'part', 'movie', 'however', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'admit', 'are', 'good', 'parts', 'cool', 'scenes', 'Wishing', 'were', 'somehow', 'here', 'again', 'where', 'MUSIC', 'MOVIE', 'become', 'one', 'sour', 'wonderful', 'Butler', ""n't"", 'scenes', 'whole', 'concept', 'was', 'so', 'twisted', 'Here', 'big', 'HANSOME', 'guy', 'trying', 'impress', 'chick', 'singing', 'pathetic', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'point', 'What', 'movie', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'PHANTOM', 'PHANTOM', 'ugly', 'guy', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'SEDUCTIVE', 'POWERFUL', 'VOICE', 'YOU', 'not', 'just', 'Christine', 'YOU', 'audience', 'not', 'HOT', 'VOICE', 'One', 'MOVIE', 'REVIEW', 'read', 'said', 'well', 'HE', 'said', 'Christine', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'Oscar', 'being', 'able', 'look', 'actually', 'was', 'impressed', 'Phantom', 'what', 'movie', 'EMBARRASSMENT']",N/A

890353,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0007TKNI8,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 13]","There are moments where the screws fall in place and ""The Phantom of Opera"" soars, musically and dramatically.As a visual achievement it's a lush and bold statement from director Joel Schumacher, a cinematic painting of opera houses, dungeons and graveyards in reds and blacks and whites and greys. Schumacher's made too many films - and some not very good ones - but technically he's strong and professional and fluid. The man can direct mood.And then there's Emmy Rossum, just an 18-year-old kid, is so pure a singer and regal a beauty - well, they found the right girl for Christine. Two of the four key elements - the production and the female lead, are such aces that the accompanying factors - The Phantom and the music - could be, well, what they are.A drag.Some musicals are simply better than others, and some bridge better to movies, too and Andrew Lloyd Webber's words and music do not immediately spring to mind as easy translations. Not for ""Evita"" and not here. One could even argue ""The Phantom of Opera"" is a lackluster musical, period, and yet the response to it is so fierce, so absolute that whatever chord it strikes in its fans is significant.And yet even fans will be let down by the singing portions of the film. They sit uneasily between spoken word scenes. Only the masquerade ball has an opening flourish decently charting a descent into song. In recent years Baz Luhrmann, Lars Von Trier and Rob Marshall found their own ways of kick-starting the musical portion of their movies (""Moulin Rouge,"" ""Dancer In The Dark,"" ""Chicago"") into gear. Schumacher's only failure is to mishandle the mixture of song and spoken word. It's a little dumb when Rossum might sing a transitionary phrase, or even a singular word, and within the same scene speak whole lines of dialogue.A lackluster Phantom, played Gerard Butler, doesn't assist matters. Butler is a beefcake lacking tragedy. Or even weariness. Or age. Or somber emotion. Hulking, moping creep he might be. His voice is a pulling moan, defiled by Rossum's clarity and pitch. He comes at the role as a slow-moving linebacker would, adding rage to his tab until he bursts near the end. Neither he nor Patrick Wilson, as the Viscount Raoul, are particularly worthy of Rossum's Christine, in voice or sex appeal, and when they duel with swords near the end of the movie, there isn't much at stake.Aside from Minnie Driver, who cannonballs into the role of opera diva Carlotta with an at-times incomprehensible Italian accent, other performers, including Miranda Richardson, generally stand to the side in hushed, reverent poses, in awe of their mere presence in the film, until they're called to sing, when they inhabit Webber's jaunty, camera-mugging persona.Certainly there is an air of ""event"" in the production, and Schumacher surely aspires to it, but passion wanes and drama is muted. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" produces mostly an uneasy heat, with Rossum, brilliant as her voice is, sandwiched between a angry slug and Some Other Guy who pops up to profess an undying love he hasn't begun to show.",3,Rossum's a knockout.

I have only seen it on stage twice (touring companies at the Orpheum Theatre/Memphis) and it is a breathtaking, heart rending story. I felt some of the very same butterflies-in-my-stomach excitement watching this film version as I did waiting for the curtain to rise on the stage version. I am as big a Michael Crawford fan as the next guy, but I am not going to go so far as to dismiss the talent of the film Phantom. Gerard Butler did a WONDERFUL job vocally, and I thought the sexiness of this phantom added a whole new dimension to the character. I know it sounds superficial, but this phantom was HOT and with talent to boot, was a huge bonus!Christine was lovely and innocent and possessed all of the qualities we would expect in Christine. Her voice was smooth and confidant and while it didn't send chills like Sarah Brightman, for her age and experience she did an incredible first rate job. I really like this girl and look forward to watching her career.One should try to approach the viewing of this film with no expectations or preconceived notions about how it should be. I was of course hoping it would mirror the stage play and while their were some discrepancies, the film was in no way a disappointment or let-down. I think the film was true to the play and it appears to me that the director loves the original piece and kept his version as honest as possible. My kids all loved it and ""got"" it.

890356,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B0007TKNI8,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[7, 8]","For those of us who have seen the stage production or listened obsessively to the Phantom soundtrack, this movie does not disappoint.  Yes, it has more than one campy moment (from Minnie Driver/Carlotta's over-the-top wig (very bad pun intended) and dress descending from the stage's ceiling to the serendipitous horse transporting the Phantom and Christine to the bowels of the Paris Opera Populaire--in real life, I don't think a horse could survive underground for very long without its hooves rotting), but even those moments have become endearing.  Though if truth be told, my friends and I laughed our heads off in the movie theatre during those two scenes.A darker and very painful part of the movie was the look into the Phantom's childhood.  I have to fast-forward this scene, or I'll start crying.  Miranda Richardson's character took pity upon the abused child, yet had no idea as a young girl that this deformed autodidact would grown up to haunt the opera house.  (In the special features disc, the director joked that Miranda Richardson interviewed him for the job, not the other way around, to see if this project was a worthwhile investment of her energy and talents.)The actor who played Raoul was brilliant as was newcomer, Emmy Rossum. People have insulted Gerard Butler's performance and compared it negatively against the standard of Michael Crawford's Phantom.  I think that Gerard's acting was very good, and I really empathized with his character's plight.  His singing was amazingly good for an amateur who had only just begun voice lessons after he won the coveted role. I challenge any critic to perform as well under those circumstances. (However, I will admit that I'm surprised that an amateur was cast for this role.)The scenery was lush, the costumes luxurious, and the music--yes, overplayed, but nonetheless--gorgeous; no expense was spared for this production. The director said that this movie as-to-date is the most expensive and lavishly produced Independent Film.  I really wish that movie producers would get the ball rolling and put Lucy Simon's ""The Secret Garden"" on the Silver Screen.  Rebecca Luker could retain her role as Lily in an on-screen production.

I preferred the film version, for the following reasons:The movie explained the 'back story'.  You see where the Phantom came from, why he grew from a tortured young boy into what he became.The set design was fantastic!  It helped open up the story by having a view of the building, the staircase, the upper reaches of the theater.  It's sort of unfair not being limited by a stage, but the director used the full ability of the big screen to offer a wonderful view of the insular world of the Paris opera.The casting was good, better than the traveling company, IMO.  Emmy Rossum WAS young, but fit the story and of course she is a talent for the future.  Gerard Butler was superb as the Phantom, Patrick Wilson OK as the wimpy Raoul.Switching back and forth from 'modern' era and earlier was very effective; tied the story together better.The singing was excellent, and the set design/art direction much better than that!  The movie did win three Academy Award nominations, after all, which is impressive as most films don't get an Oscar nod.I've pre-ordered this film and eagerly await its arrival.

890362,A2I7ZAB04Q0DML,B0007TKNI8,Scott Kolecki,"[51, 75]","Since its London premier in 1986, Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has dazzled audiences with some of the most powerful stage performances ever seen.  Combining an epic soundtrack full of rich, lavish music with some of the most technologically advanced special effects of its time, Phantom has delivered an unforgettable performance for almost 2 decades!So why risk bringing such an incredibly successful live show to the silver screen, when Hollywood musicals have never done especially well?  The answer, in this case, is simple.  The Phantom is a musical about the power and passion of music.  Where so many musicals are a telling of a story set to song, Phantom instead uses the songs to advance a narrative story about a deformed genius who teaches an exceptionally gifted chorus girl to sing.  The music works becuase, as with most musical, it does advance the storyline, it also serves as underscoring to set tension, mood, romance and horror throughout the story, working more like a very effective movie soundtrack than musical score.  Combine this element with a story that contains all the goodies that make Hollywood blockbusters great: romance, horror, action, suspense and of course, epic storytelling, and you have a package that can't help but be successful on the big screen.Many fans of the musical are troubled by the casting of the lead parts.  Gerard Butler, a veteran screen actor, will done the mask and vocal parts of the Phantom, whose character was originally developed for Broadway superstar Michael Crawford.  Relative newcomer, Emmy Rossum will take on the demanding role of Christine Daae', a part that Lloyd Webber wrote specifically for (now ex) wife Sarah Brightman.  The use of this newcomer in this film is a calculated risk, but as the part of Christine is that of a woman who is relatively unknown, her involvement in the project might add a degree of believability to her character.The supporting cast is surprising as well.  Many of Hollywood's respected names are on board for this film in parts that are, at least in the stage version of this film, far smaller than the roles of Christine and the Phantom.  Miranda Richardson will play Madam Giry, and Minnie Driver will play the part of Opera Diva, Carlotta.The strength of this cast will be based on its ability to perform many of the productions demanding numbers.  Speculation has been circling that Andrew Lloyd Webber had been working on a sequel to his successful film, but it is now believed that the film version of Phantom will, in fact, contain the numbers that he has previewed at select concert venues in the past couple years.Directing this film is Joel Schumacher, whose name is synonymous with some of Hollywood's most successful films (St Elmo's Fire, Flatliners, 8mm, Phone Booth to name only a few).  His ability to create atmosphere and tension is second to none, and he should provide a vision to this film that will give it a vitality that will equal the spectacular stage direction origianlly given by Hal Prince.This film is scheduled to premire on December 25, 2004 nationwide.",5,Webber's Phantom Comes To the Silver Screen,1083801600,"05 6, 2004",2004,3110,"['London', 'premier', '1986', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'dazzled', 'audiences', 'most', 'powerful', 'stage', 'performances', 'ever', 'seen', 'Combining', 'epic', 'soundtrack', 'full', 'rich', 'lavish', 'music', 'most', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'special', 'effects', 'time', 'Phantom', 'delivered', 'unforgettable', 'performance', 'almost', '2', 'decades', 'So', 'why', 'risk', 'bringing', 'such', 'incredibly', 'successful', 'live', 'show', 'silver', 'screen', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'musicals', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'especially', 'well', 'answer', 'case', 'simple', 'Phantom', 'musical', 'power', 'passion', 'music', 'Where', 'so', 'many', 'musicals', 'are', 'telling', 'story', 'set', 'song', 'Phantom', 'instead', 'songs', 'advance', 'narrative', 'story', 'deformed', 'genius', 'who', 'exceptionally', 'gifted', 'chorus', 'girl', 'sing', 'music', 'becuase', 'most', 'musical', 'advance', 'storyline', 'also', 'underscoring', 'set', 'tension', 'mood', 'romance', 'horror', 'story', 'working', 'more', 'very', 'effective', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'musical', 'score', 'Combine', 'element', 'story', 'goodies', 'make', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'great', 'romance', 'horror', 'action', 'suspense', 'course', 'epic', 'storytelling', 'have', 'package', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'successful', 'big', 'screen.Many', 'fans', 'musical', 'are', 'troubled', 'casting', 'lead', 'parts', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'veteran', 'screen', 'actor', 'will', 'done', 'mask', 'vocal', 'parts', 'Phantom', 'character', 'was', 'originally', 'developed', 'Broadway', 'superstar', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'Relative', 'newcomer', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'will', 'take', 'demanding', 'role', 'Christine', 'Daae', 'part', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'wrote', 'specifically', 'now', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'use', 'newcomer', 'film', 'calculated', 'risk', 'part', 'Christine', 'woman', 'who', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'involvement', 'project', 'might', 'add', 'degree', 'believability', 'character.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'surprising', 'as', 'well', 'Many', 'Hollywood', 'respected', 'names', 'are', 'board', 'film', 'parts', 'are', 'least', 'stage', 'version', 'film', 'far', 'smaller', 'roles', 'Christine', 'Phantom', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'will', 'play', 'Madam', 'Giry', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'will', 'play', 'part', 'Opera', 'Diva', 'Carlotta.The', 'strength', 'cast', 'will', 'be', 'based', 'ability', 'perform', 'many', 'productions', 'demanding', 'numbers', 'Speculation', 'been', 'circling', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'sequel', 'successful', 'film', 'now', 'believed', 'film', 'version', 'Phantom', 'will', 'fact', 'contain', 'numbers', 'previewed', 'select', 'concert', 'venues', 'past', 'couple', 'years.Directing', 'film', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'name', 'synonymous', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'successful', 'films', 'St', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'Flatliners', '8mm', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'name', 'only', 'few', 'ability', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'second', 'none', 'should', 'provide', 'vision', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'vitality', 'will', 'equal', 'spectacular', 'stage', 'direction', 'origianlly', 'given', 'Hal', 'Prince.This', 'film', 'scheduled', 'premire', 'December', '25', '2004', 'nationwide']",N/A

But I went with my friends, begrudgingly I might add, and I enjoyed almost all of it.Emmy Rossum- She seems lovely, but her movie performance seemed to be lacking in my opinion.  She does a good job of seeming almost torn between Erik and Raoul but at the same time she comes off as caring very little for either.  I don't think that is what she was trying to convey, but it is how she came across.  Her voice is decent, but as others have mentioned, I expected a stronger voice from ""Christine"".Gerard Butler- Again, some say his voice is subpar as the Phantom but I think he made the Phantom more real to many people.  His emotion came through and so the singing was not always flawless.  In ""Down Once More"" his rage and madness come through in the singing, but some think it makes his singing ""bad"", nope, just makes his portrayal more gripping.  The make up needed work for his ""disfiguration"".  In the scenes with the mask we see this beautiful head of hair and a perfect hairline, yet the mask comes off and suddenly the hair is longer, a different color and the hair line is non-existant because of the disfiguration?  That is a bit of an ""ooops"" in the technical department if you ask me.Patrick Wilson-  The first time around (yes, went twice!) I wasn't sure what to make of him.  His voice was lovely both times, but I was unsure whether it was his acting or Emmy's that seemed to be throwing the plot off center.  The second time I found him delightful and I actually like Raoul a LOT more after the film.  This role should make people forget about ""The Alamo"" ;)The rest of the cast is splendid.  No complaints, they are funny when they need to be and they rivet the attention when need be.  Miranda is a most splendid Madame Giry and Minnie's Carlotta is funny and dramatic, just as it should be.  The sets are stunning and the best part of the whole film may very well be the first 5 minutes when the curtain comes off the chandelier and the Phantom theme swells.

890372,A1PIRNQ1I06XTV,B0007TKNI8,Sherrie Jackson,"[2, 3]","I'll review the movie in a moment. What I want to share first is how pleasantly surprised I am at the extras included. Sure, they could have given us more--four different kinds of trailers, costume design boards, a scene from every Phantom movie thus far, interviews with Crawford and Brightman, not to mention commentaries. But hey, isn't that what Christmas is for? :)However, I was enthralled by the story of how the musical came to be. We get not only plenty of airtime from Lord Webber and Stilgoe & Hart, but we see the original stars in footage that we would never be able to see otherwise. Sara Brightman singing ""Pie Jesu"" in what looks to be a cathedral, Michael Crawford doing light comedy--light comedy!--on a British show and performing in the circus. We're taken into Webber's estate to view the singers who first performed the Phantom material as it was being constructed, and are enlightened as to how Britain charmingly previewed the musical, via music video, to the rest of the nation as what looked to be, quite literally, a rock opera. (Well, it WAS the 80s.)The other extras that focus on the movie production are also quite good. I thought it might be only a slightly longer version of one of those HBO First Looks, but it was super-informative. In it you get a look at the premier, at part of Emmy Rossum's screen test, the fun of trying to understand Jennifer Ellison's (Meg) accent, Patrick Wilson singing opera in sport pants, the Mask of the Red Death swigging from a water bottle, plus a look at the outrageously elaborate costumes and what the chandelier falling looked like in real life. There's so much more I can't remember, but trust me, it's worth it.I'm not sure sure about the additional scene. I'm glad they didn't keep it in. While it's a lovely song, the Phantom was too soft, not at all obsessive or dangerous. And we don't want that, now, do we?And, about that movie. Emmy Rossum has a perfectly capable voice even at her age, just as Christine is supposed to be quite young. But her face had the same expression on it--trancelike--almost the entire time. When she saw Raoul caught in the Punjab lasso and cried out, I was like, Finally! And then she went back into the trance. I wish they had coaxed more expression out of her.Gerard Butler. Either you love him or you hate him. We all know he's hot. I was really surprised at first sight of the Phantom, because from the stage shows you get the impression that even with the mask on, he's a crowish figure of no less than forty years. I enjoy watching Butler, but if they had used someone less attractive I don't think it would have taken anything away from the movie. As for his voice--I whispered to my mom at one point that he sounds like a rock star. And yes, Butler was indeed in a rock band. He's no Michael Crawford. And sometimes his treatment of phrases isn't the best. But on the flip side, sometimes it's just as uncomfortable listening to a stage Phantom sing in full-on operatic mode. It's...whatever you like, I guess.Of course, the sets are lavish and the costumes lush (and vice versa). I love Minnie Driver in the Carlotta role, and the men who played the managers were really a delight. I know people gripe about all these different things--the addition of scenes, speaking dialogue that was previously sung, the misplacement of the chandelier's big scene, a colorful masquerade being clothed in black and white. But in the end I still think the movie is more than worth it. Why?Because you can see it whenever you want to now. Because the full orchestra sounds heaven-sent. Because knowing all the words to a musical is a big deal. Because it's beautiful. Because it's a full-on experience that requires nothing less than your full attention. Because snow and confetti falling never looked so perfect.

I read Emmy's & Gerry's interviews on the web and I even went so far to view Gerry's astrology chart, hey it was there on the web to see and the man turns me on in so many levels, so what the heck. Let's not mince words, Gerry's voice warbles in parts, absolutely soars in others. Emmy's voice wasn't consistent either, so vocal experience has nothing to do with it. The rock quality is there in this Phantom, no question, and I love that about this movie. I relate to this story on many levels though I have tried so hard not to give in... heh heh. I have been learning Phantom myself as part of my own vocal training, so I understand how it goes. You have to have ear, emotion, practice, some technical skill, some understanding of anatomy and what to do with it, you have to warm up, you also have to have heart, and quality. Like Gerry, my career changed direction. I'm glad this movie came out when it did. It was hard for me to feel the music I was supposed to be learning without ever having seen the theatrical version. Gerry made Phantom history; his performance IS a milestone in the art and interpretation of this awesome story of passion, loss, and life. Adding a rock sound to the Phantom's voice is not a crime. Rock is about breaking barriers and I love the way this movie invites young people learning voice training onto this edge, this wonderful spear between classical sound, richness to the ear, and rock opera. It's beautiful, sumptious, romantic, painful, releasing, rich, edgy, genius, I love it, and I know there are young composers out there who will see this movie, get inspired, and start on a highway in life that will create even new milestones in music history. And Gerry's astrology chart? One look at his chart and I knew why he made such a great phantom. I left this movie finally getting it, just getting it. Though phantom has felt such pain and loss, he lived like a zoo animal as a child for pete's sake, he is greatful to have had this mirror of her innocence held up to him, just the first lovely person he's ever come across in the highway of life.

Okay, take a deep breath. Never having seen him before, he was a revelation. The way he uses his voice and body language is a subtle seduction that stays with you long after the movie is over. And he makes the unmasked Phantom as sexy as the mysterious masked & caped Angel of Music. His raw intensity and tragic longing is sensational. (My husband says he's buying a cape - like that's all it would take? Oh, sweetheart.)Emmy Rossum as Christine has a lovely voice but lacks any true sensual appeal - sorry girl, but I don't know what he sees in you and how can you resist that bed! Patrick Wilson as the Viscount can also sing and act but, of course, he's no Phantom. Maybe they deserve each other - too bad they get to share one of the best love songs every written with ""All I Ask of You."" The worst part of the movie is the role of Carlotta which is horribly overdone.She's soooo annoying and her scenes are much too long. Use those minutes to go get a snack.The directing is weak, there are just too many scenes with the opera singers and ballet dancers when all anyone really cares about is the romantic triangle. What was the director thinking in cutting constantly to flamingo dancers during the deeply sensual 'Point of No Return' number.(That will raise your temperature a degree of two.)Everyone knows the story so, suffice to say that the movie is very lush, with beautiful sets and costumes.

Plus the supporting cast was good.  I like it visually but when I heard a song by Butler I prayed it was a song for a tenor and not a baritone.

890382,A3ELSU1SHRX09Y,B0007TKNI8,skunktrain,"[6, 6]","I admit, I'll never be a major Phantom ""fangirl."" However, I can understand the appeal of this deeply melodramatic, gothic musical. I'd seen the musical on stage years ago, and while I thought it was very good, it did not inspire a life-long fandom in me. However, the film offers something a stage production cannot--a more close, intimate, and lush experience. So it's no surprise that the movie adaptation had a greater impact on me than the stage musical.I came into this movie with an open mind about casting and other details. I didn't have a firm, rigid idea of who would (or would not) be good as the Phantom. I'd never seen Michael Crawford play the part, only the younger, more attractive Davis Gaines. So, I had no trouble with Gerard Butler as the Phantom. His voice is not perfect, but he sings with great emotion and gusto. It seemed to me that he made the most of his limited vocal skills, and so I found his singing surprisingly good--in a raw, uneven sort of way. Butler is also strikingly handsome in this film, which is funny, because in the few other films I've seen him in, he was more average-looking. I think he's one of these ""chameleon"" type guys who can look drastically different in various roles. He sure makes a fabulous impression as the Phantom.Emmy Rossum is lovely, has an absolutely stunning (STUNNING) voice, and seems to possess the right amount of sweetness and innocence for the role of Christine. Patrick Wilson also has a gorgeous voice, (but I *hated* his hair). He does the best he can as the almost universally disliked Raoul. (Well, we don't *dislike* him, we just don't *like* him all that much. He's not nearly as interesting as the Phantom!) Minnie Driver is also great as a prima donna pain-in-the-neck diva. She always has outlandish constumes and is very funny.I enjoyed the music--the melodies are appealing and stick in your head, but after a while I started to think, ""Didn't I hear this tune before?"" Lots of recycling of material. It's not all *that* bad, and I liked the music enough to buy a few songs online, but when I compare it to some other famous musicals of the past, it does not measure up.The thing I most enjoyed about this movie are the visual elements--the photography, the costumes, the sets, (oh my, the elaborate sets!). The attention to detail was fantastic. A feast for the eyes. And yeah, the actors and actresses are all a feast for the eyes too--everyone's very attractive.The story is . . . let's not mince words . . . a trifle *thin*. I wished there was more character development, and I wish there was more backstory, more fleshing out of the Phantom's and Christine's prior (and very strange) mentor/protegee relationship. It's still an interesting tale, especially near the ending, when things really start to pick up.My advice to anyone who has never seen any variation of ""Phantom"" is to realize that it is *WAY* over-the-top with melodrama--is angst-ridden, gothic, terribly romantic. There's the dramatic swishing of flowing capes, single red roses dropped in the snow, swooning, and so forth.

Look around - there's another mask behind you!Those two lines from one of my favorite songs in my favorite Broadway musical analogize perfectly the amount of different leads that I've seen in the role of the Phantom.When you've seen the best in a role it is hard to appreciate the next guy as much. Michael Crawford was by far the superior Phantom. He acted the part well, with emotion and an unparalleled vocal performance. Howard McGillin (who can still be seen on Broadway) is also excellent. So Gerard Butler had some very very big shoes to fill...and he filled them well.But Butler's voice was not as powerful (or it did not come through as so in the film version) as Crawford's or even McGillen's. To try to put it in perspective, would you go to see Pavarotti if you knew his understudy would be doing the performance? Seeing Butler in the role will be just fine for anyone who's not experienced Crawford or McGillin, but for me it came across as a very good understudy performance. This is the reason the film gets 4 instead of 5 stars; I am of the opinion that the film producers settled when there was a better leading man option somewhere out there.On the other hand, Emmy Rossum shocked me in the film. She was as amazing as the first time that I heard and saw the part of Christine played live by Sarah Brightman.Ultimately, I enjoyed the film immensely. After seeing the Broadway show more than a half-dozen times, I was quite skeptical that the film version would/could do the production justice. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie version looked great and the sound was absolutely terrific.But like any musical performance on DVD, if you've ever seen the live show you can't come close to comparing the audio experience unless you have a surround sound system and the DVD is offered (like Phantom is) in DTS or Dolby 5.1.  It really makes a giant difference if you have to experience a musical performance in the far inferior standard 2.0 stereo versus 5.1 or better offerings.Not that Phantom (or other musical performances) can't be enjoyed without a surround system. Especially if you've NOT had the opportunity to see the live show to compare it to.So, first I'd recommend coming to New York and seeing the 5-star live performance of Phantom of the Opera on Broadway before it closes. Don't want to make the trip?...Then spend the money on a good surround system instead, and pick up the film version of Phantom for your collection. Don't want to travel? Don't want to upgrade? Already have surround? Then the film version will do just fine.

890384,A2PJUHR9LD9XKZ,B0007TKNI8,Skywalker,"[0, 0]","Black and white images, an opera house crumbling under dust and cobwebs, half decayed opera requisites, old opera visitors from times long past participating in an auction. Then all at once a sudden bright light coming from the chandelier, spreading more and more, and the journey to the past begins. Dust is blown down, colour comes into the scenery, cobwebs are blown away, the music whirls up like an explosion of sound and the viewer is carried away into the happenings of the years 1870.A stunningly beautiful scene, and please savour it. Because it will remain more or less the best of all - unfortunately.Beginning right after the introduction, this film is packed full of clich&eacute;s and details who seem to scream the underlying intention of ""pleasing the viewer"", at the expense of authenticity and depth. My impression was that nobody who was involved in making this film was actually interested in the story and the people it concerned, what a horrifying and tragic (by the way: real in all essential features) story it wants to tell.The so-called phantom of the opera was not an English-sytle, romantic, lovestruck young man who jealously fought against his rival for the innocent maiden he had chosen like in a swashbuckler: he was a middle-aged man of outstanding intelligence and talents but, on account of his physical disfiguration, isolated, soul-crippled, emotionally tortured and bordering on insanity, who saw in the young and sensitive chorus girl Christine Da&eacute;e his only and last chance to still experience some love and happiness in this world. As depicted in this film, the phantom's looks border on ridiculous, they hardly justify a life-long estrangement from the rest of the world; in Gaston Leroux' book it was described more than enough that his face practically looked like a living skull.Christine's growing maturity into adulthood is not an issue here, and the same goes for her inner conflict when she sees herself standing between these two men; she is reduced to the role of the ""innocent"" maiden who has to be saved from the monster by her hero (even if in this case, in the end she saves herself).The film's settings are almost all very beautiful, and also the costumes, although they sometimes are annoying (e.g. the ""Think of Me"" scene where Christine looks like the Austrian empress Sissi when she should be interpreting Karthago's queen Elissa - I guess the costume makers respectively producers were of the opinion that the average filmgoer would sooner find associations with the Sissi than with the Elissa costume). Some of the special effects are simply superfluous, e.g. in the case of Christine's abduction where the mirror seems to dissolve itself, which is nonsense - of course it was a rotating mirror. At the beginning of the ""All I Ask of You"" scene Christine steps on the roof of the opera house barefoot despite the snow; only why? There is not the least reason for this, and how is a girl supposed to come into a romantic mood with frozen feet?The cast's singing voices are rather good, although of course not everyone can be such an exceptionally gifted casting for the phantom as Michael Crawford in the original performance and recording. The choreography is acceptable, too, except for the unfortunately totally uninspired ""Masquerade"".Gerard Butler cast as the phantom is, I must honestly say, alarmingly colourless in his performance, in particular in the scenes which would require some sensitiveness; the phantom as he plays him is a powerful man, romantic, dangerous, jealous, but you can hardly feel any kind of pain and passionate love in him. His singing voice is acceptable, but such a role would have required an outstanding singer, since the phantom had no chance to win his girl's heart with manly attractiveness and his only seductive power was in his beautiful voice; and for this purpose Butler I have to say is not convincing.Whose performance is unsurpassed is Minnie Driver's as Madame Carlotta, and also her song ""Primadonna"" is sung, played and choreographed best of all.But this is exactly where the film's weakness is again to be seen: one ought not to allow a minor character to steal the protagonist's show. This whole film does not take itself, the plot and the characters seriously. The viewer is not in the least confronted with the feelings the story is all about, the abysmal human cruelty and on the other hand sky-rocketing hope; everybody involved remains detached from actual pain and despair, one even has difficulties feeling with the phantom and his dark fate. Through the cheap showmanship applied in this film he was degraded to what he was in his childhood: a curious freak of nature whom you may stare at while visiting a fair with a slight, agreeable shudder to then leave him behind, not in the least touched by the tragedy of his life.Of course we do have Webber's music here, his play (even if slightly adapted, e.g. you can see a few details which were borrowed from Susan Kay and Jean Cocteau), and it is certainly true that Webber's musical did partly mitigate the story and add some romantic detail. But nevertheless it had remained a deeply touching and haunting story, not laden with clich&eacute;s and abandoned to superficiality as here. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a story about is deep emotions, but it was set on screen as if its origin was a comic book of sorts. (Sarcastically speaking, director Joel Schumacher seemed to think it was supposed to be just another of his Batman films.)I realize that being a fan of the musical practically from its first hour, who has known every single note and word of the score since the last twenty-five years and more, has read both Gaston Leroux' as well as Susan Kay's novel repeatedly and both in their original language and has seen different performances at different theatres one can probably only remain disappointed by a film version. Nevertheless, I did expect at least a little more commitment. It hurts to see that apparently almost no one who participated in making this film really devoted himself to it with the enthusiasm this tragic plot, the complex characters and their relationships with one another as well as the strikingly beautifully music (which Webber had written as a declaration of love for Sarah Brightman, who was his wife at the time) would have deserved.If you are interested in a beautifully made and atmospherically convincing - not perfectly made either but at least not superficial - version of the musical I would recommend the recording from the Royal Albert Hall on occasion of the 25th anniversary.",2,I'm still shaking my head in disbelief...

Carlotta seems to be a somewhat over-the-top character, and Ms. Driver plays the role to perfection, with all the mannerisms and things one would expect from a demanding diva.2) Emmy Rossum as Christine.  The time this young woman spent in the Metropolitan Opera's youth program paid off.  Her singing as Christine was exquisite, so much so that I found myself looking forward to the numbers where she sang solo, since Butler, while not bad, failed to measure up in the numbers he sang with her.All in all, it could have been better, but this film did have its moments, which is why I didn't give it the lower rating.

My only experience with musicals outside of Disney material like ""Cinderella"" and ""Beauty And The Beast"" (both recommended) comes from ""The Sound Of Music"" and ""The Wizard Of Oz"" (also both recommended), and for some reason I expected this version of ""Phantom"" to be full of lavish sets and singing during the rehearsals and performances of the stage company's productions (which it was) but I didn't expect so much of the film outside of those parts to be conducted in song.  At first it discombulated me a bit, but as the movie went on I was increasingly glad it had taken this route.  It was an unusual way to go for what, while being a romantic movie lush with tragedy, is still also very much a horror movie.  But the songs and musical accompaniment all through - expertly done by an extremely talented cast and ensemble of musicians - perfectly conveyed what the movie was going for.Full of grandeur, dark awe, emotion and visual magnificence, the latest version of the tale of the ill-fortuned opera house and its resident specter combs territory not fully delved into in previous versions I've seen and features cinematography that develops the most dramatic moments to maximum effectiveness.  The amount of light-hearted humor was also unexpected, but it made for some great contrasts, including the first appearance of the thunderous-voiced Phantom during a packed-house performance of one of the company's musicals, bringing the house to a shocking standstill.One of the few problems was with the Phantom's main nemesis.  He was a fine, likable character, the performer who portrayed him a great actor and a great singer, but he did not strike me as being a realistically adequate foil for the grand and often ferocious Phantom.  A defeciency that's not crippling but has slightly hobbled a few excellent horror movies over the years.The other versions of the ""Phantom"" movie I've seen are the Hammer version starring Herbert Lom and Heather Sears - not one of the best Hammer movies by a long shot, but still good, featuring an excellent turn by Michael Gough as the wickedly and humourously deplorable theater owner: it's available in the ""Hammer Horror Series"" set which also includes alltime greats like ""Nightmare"" and ""Night Creatures""; and the 1989 Robert Englund/Jill Schoelen version - a much more vicious version feauring a far less sympathetic Phantom, it also has some great music that's sadly gone unnoticed.All 3 versions recommended; I've yet to see the Lon Chaney silent version, the 40s Universal version, the 1998 ""Il Fantasma Dell'Opera"" Italian-language version, the 1916 German silent version (apparantly among a number of films from that era of which no print exists any longer, sadly), or the 1983 or 1990 made-for-tv versions.",5,Excellent Musical Version Of The Legendary Horror,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,2856,"['latest', 'adaptation', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'was', 'quite', 'different', 'what', 'expected', 'only', 'experience', 'musicals', 'Disney', 'material', 'Cinderella', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'recommended', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'also', 'recommended', 'reason', 'expected', 'version', 'Phantom', 'be', 'full', 'lavish', 'sets', 'singing', 'rehearsals', 'performances', 'stage', 'company', 'productions', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'parts', 'be', 'conducted', 'song', 'first', 'discombulated', 'bit', 'movie', 'went', 'was', 'increasingly', 'glad', 'had', 'taken', 'route', 'was', 'unusual', 'way', 'go', 'what', 'being', 'romantic', 'movie', 'lush', 'tragedy', 'still', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'horror', 'movie', 'songs', 'musical', 'accompaniment', 'expertly', 'done', 'extremely', 'talented', 'cast', 'ensemble', 'musicians', 'perfectly', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'for.Full', 'grandeur', 'dark', 'awe', 'emotion', 'visual', 'magnificence', 'latest', 'version', 'tale', 'ill-fortuned', 'opera', 'house', 'resident', 'specter', 'combs', 'territory', 'not', 'fully', 'delved', 'previous', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'features', 'cinematography', 'most', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'maximum', 'effectiveness', 'amount', 'light-hearted', 'humor', 'was', 'also', 'unexpected', 'made', 'great', 'contrasts', 'including', 'first', 'appearance', 'thunderous-voiced', 'Phantom', 'packed-house', 'performance', 'one', 'company', 'musicals', 'bringing', 'house', 'shocking', 'standstill.One', 'few', 'problems', 'was', 'Phantom', 'main', 'nemesis', 'was', 'fine', 'likable', 'character', 'performer', 'who', 'portrayed', 'great', 'actor', 'great', 'singer', 'did', 'not', 'strike', 'being', 'realistically', 'adequate', 'foil', 'grand', 'often', 'ferocious', 'Phantom', 'defeciency', 'not', 'crippling', 'slightly', 'hobbled', 'few', 'excellent', 'horror', 'movies', 'years.The', 'other', 'versions', 'Phantom', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'Hammer', 'version', 'starring', 'Herbert', 'Lom', 'Heather', 'Sears', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'Hammer', 'movies', 'long', 'shot', 'still', 'good', 'featuring', 'excellent', 'turn', 'Michael', 'Gough', 'wickedly', 'humourously', 'deplorable', 'theater', 'owner', 'available', 'Hammer', 'Horror', 'Series', 'set', 'also', 'alltime', 'greats', 'Nightmare', 'Night', 'Creatures', '1989', 'Robert', 'Englund/Jill', 'Schoelen', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'vicious', 'version', 'feauring', 'far', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'Phantom', 'also', 'great', 'music', 'sadly', 'gone', 'unnoticed.All', '3', 'versions', 'recommended', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'silent', 'version', '40s', 'Universal', 'version', '1998', 'Il', 'Fantasma', ""Dell'Opera"", 'Italian-language', 'version', '1916', 'German', 'silent', 'version', 'apparantly', 'number', 'films', 'era', 'print', 'longer', 'sadly', '1983', '1990', 'made-for-tv', 'versions']",N/A

890397,AY01SMUH5SX8A,B0007TKNI8,"Steven Valenti ""svclue""","[7, 20]","Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is one of the most popular musicals of all time and an undeniably exciting experience in the theater.  With its lush music, spectacular design, and slick direction by Harold Prince, the stage version already has a cinematic quality that you'd think would be a natural fit for film. Certainly ""Phantom"" would seem an easier film to make than say, Lloyd Webber's ""Evita,"" which, despite its real-life subject, has a spare, surreal quality on stage.  But the film ""Evita,"" in the capable hands of director Alan Parker, turned out to be quite brilliant--  the great score was enhanced by stunning cinematography and authentic art direction, as well as some really fine performances (yes, including Madonna's).  But, alas, Lloyd Webber trusted Joel Schumacher with this one-- that's right: he chose the director responsible for those much-hated grotesqueries ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"" to adapt his most famous work for film.  Not a good decision.Now, to be fair, Lloyd Webber seemed to have based his choice on the fact that Schumacher directed the enjoyable teen vampire flick ""The Lost Boys"" in the 80's.  That film does give some indication that Schumacher could handle the gothic romance and supernatural elements that make ""Phantom"" so compelling on stage.  One only wishes the composer had followed up on the director's career before offering the job.  The ""Phantom"" film is less ""Lost Boys"" and very much more in the same hit- 'em- over- the-head, cartoonish style as Schumacher's Batman movies.  If he was going to choose a ""Batman"" director, it should have been Tim Burton.The best thing about the film is Emmy Rossum, who really is just about perfect as the ingenue Christine Da'ae:  Great voice, right age and look, good acting ability.  There is also some nice cinematography, especially during ""All I Ask of You,"" the rooftop love duet between Christine and Raoul (Patrick Wilson). The rest of the movie is horribly miscalculated.Aside from Rossum, the performances are weak.  Gerard Butler as the Phantom and Minnie Driver as the opera diva Carlotta, are simply too over-the-top and downright corny.  Someone, presumably Shumacher, should have reminded the cast that this is a film and not the stage production.  On stage, you can get away with a little overacting-- the theatrical emoting is needed to reach everyone in the theater.  On film, with the benefit of things like close-ups and editing, you can be more subtle.  There is a whole lot of ridiculous mugging go on here.In fact, a little more subtlety across the board could have made this a much better film.  I know many would say that Lloyd Webber's score is anything but subtle, and that's probably true.  But the stage version of ""Phantom,"" is sort of understated in some important ways.  Above all, the show coasts on the music more than character development and plot.  The music is so emotionally involving that you hardly notice that you really know next to nothing about Christine or the Phantom, or anyone else.  And it works really well.  On stage, the emotional pull of the music and the staging fills in the gaps in the storytelling.  There really is a spare, mysterious quality to ""Phantom"" on stage that is completely absent from the film.The film is full of distracting and unnecessary additions.  Shumacher goes to great lengths to strip the musical of its mystery and gothic elements-- what was dark, brooding, and mysterious on stage is now too colorful, too flamboyant, and utterly devoid of anything supernatural.  The film goes out of its way to explain all the Phantom's actions in entirely practical terms.  For instance, Carlotta does not mysteriously lose her voice by potentially otherworldly means.  No, here, the Phantom is seen blatantly placing a presumably poisoned bottle of throat spray within her reach.  Least forgivable is a silly flashback scene with a voice over by Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) explaining the Phantom's origin.  On stage, her explanation is quick and vague, almost a throwaway--  it's much better that way.  Do we really need everything spelled out for us?The big musical numbers, which should be the highlight, are dragged down by bad choices.  Everything is too busy.The most ludicrous example of this comes during ""Point of No Return,"" which should be an emotional highpoint.  The Phantom appears disguised on stage during the performance of his opera, and his duet with Christine doubles as a commentary on their complex relationship.  Instead of focusing squarely on the Phantom and Christine, Schumacher undermines the emotion of the scene by intercutting images of some entirely inappropriate and laughably modern- seeming backup dancers.  Why?At the end of the day, this is just a bad adaptation of a good musical.  I hate the idea that anyone who hasn't seen the stage version would form an opinion based on this film.  In fact, it would have been wiser, more entertaining, and immeasurably cheaper, if they had just filmed a stage performance and distributed that.",2,An unsatisfying adaptation of a good

890401,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B0007TKNI8,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[11, 12]","After what seems like an eternity of hoping, wishing, waiting, and wondering, one of the greatest Broadway musicals ever to infect American Pop Culture is at long last shining in the big screen for all to see. Finally, finally, FINALLY all of the mystery, music, and magic is ours for to be experienced again and again for far less than the price of a stage theater ticket.I remember when the Phantom of the Opera first appeared on the stage, at the time I was a young child. EVERYONE was talking about it. Everyone was seeing it. And everyone loved it. Some merely bought the T-shirts, the soundtracks, and various other memorabilia, while others became full-blown fanatics, going to see every Andrew Lloyd Webber musical they could find. As for me myself, I went years listening to the brilliant score and never quite understanding it. Although Phantom is a highly theatrical experience, the music does indeed stand on its own. When I actually saw the show in San Francisco (in my teens) it all came together even moreso in a way that I shall never forget. Needless to say I had high hopes for this film. But with all the delays and rumors floating around I also had a healthy dose of fear of what might happen to my beloved musical. That largely subsided however, when I saw the first awesome teaser trailer making use of the awesome musical score and some breath-taking cimematography. I went to the film hoping for the unthinkable. I was not disappointed.First of all I have to say that I absolutely love the score to The Phantom of the Opera. I'm sure I'm not alone in the opinion that it is the finest score Andrew Lloyd Webber ever wrote. While seeing it live on stage sung by actors before your very eyes is one thing, hearing it in crystal-clear digital sound through massive theater speakers is quite another. Especially when you consider that the score had not been re-mastered, but re-recorded, played bigger, brighter, and more beautifully than ever (thanks to a carefully picked symphony orchestra). Honestly, from the moment that chandelier started moving the score had my full attention, and it never let go through the whole movie. Heck, I think it's worth seeing the movie for the musical score alone. But as this is a musical there IS singing.Much has already been said about Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, but as they aren't in this movie I'm going to be objective and instead focus on the people who ARE in it ;) Emmy Rossum. I'll say it again. EMMY ROSSUM. Oh my. She is AWESOME. Granted, I had long thought that nothing could compete with the original cast, and Christine's part in particular. Because of this, it took a song or two for me to realize just how incredible her singing is. Is it perfect? No. Is it blow the doors down powerful? No. What then? It's PURE. Her voice is like an angel. It's innocent and sweet and emotionally charged. It holds your attention and doesn't let go. In other words, it is perfect for the PART that she plays, the part of Christine. I dare say that she IS the character while you are watching this movie, and her performance really and truly holds this film together, as everything hinges on her. Of course I could go on and on about how she's gorgeous, and how her acting is just SO incredible, about how she may redefine what people think of when they say ""Christine from Phantom of the Opera"". But there is so much more...I know what you're thinking. What about the Phantom? When I first saw the actual film trailer I was skeptical. Gerard Butler is not an Opera singer, he's an actor. So when he's the character the film is named after in the biggest musical-to-film adaptation since who knows when you have to wonder. But just watch the movie and take his performance on its own merits. While his singing may lack the smoothness of others (indeed he snaps and growls some of the lyrics), he is at no time BAD. His singing is powerful, and emotional, the two most vital things (to say nothing of from the heart). And then there's his acting. I know people who are crazed fans of this guy (both men and women) and there's no denying that his acting is always at least above average, if not superb.  As you watch the film Point of No Return and the Phantom's final scenes in particular should grab your attention (okay, I cried the second time I saw the film). To summarize: due to the fact that Phantom of the Opera is really a dramatic work, the slight weakness of his Butler's voice is more than made up for in the strength of his acting (both bodily and vocally). Anyone who has watched the stage play will probably know about I mean when I say that the Phantom needs to be a suave, cool, handsome character (with the exception of his horrid half-face), and in my opinion Butler nails the character down better than any actor I can think of could have. Bravo.The other members of the cast likewise give wonderful performances all-around. The mysterious Madame Giry, the child-like Meg, and the deliciously over-the-top Carlotta are all fabulously played by their respective actors (Miranda Richardson, Jennifer Ellison, and Minnie Driver respectively). Our Raoul, (Patrick Wilson) comes across more as a calm voice of sanity in the sea of strong character types than as a romantic lead, but his singing is solid and his looks handsome enough (his acting isn't bad either).The real star of the show though, is the incredible rendition of the classic score, the mesmorizing visuals, and the utterly immersive spell the film weaves through its short 2 1/2 hours. In this day and age, special effects are often used for the sake of special effects, and the shaky hand-held cameras are enough to make you lose your lunch. Even worse, hardly anyone seems to recall what a great musical is, let alone knows how to make one. This film is a perfect example of what a musical should be. The special effects are like magic (from the photographs that turn real to the theater that is restored to its former glory, to the phantom who disappears in flash of light and a blaze of fire), the musical numbers are grand (Masquerade is simply glorious), and there are is no filler that I can see. The synchronization of the actors with their vocals is perfect (no where did it look like an obvious overdub [brief reminder: musicals HAVE to use overdubs for wide shots!]), the balance between orchestra and vocals is superb, the chemistry between key players is wonderful.The beauty of the camerawork, set design, and overall visual feel of the movie really can't be overstated. Everything is just so vibrant, beautiful, and crystal-clear. Everything feels like a dream, like a distant memory where everything has become more pronounced and exaggerated over time. The theater is so bright and beautiful, the graveyard so gothic and atmospheric, the snow-covered rooftop so romantic, and the costumes so sumptuous that you are completely caught-up in the world. This is NOT reality. This is the world seen through the memory of the dreams of youth. This is the Phantom of the Opera.",5,"""He's here.

The Phantom is not supposed to be hot, he's supposed to be grotesque and horribly deformed. And his voice in the movie was horrible, it sounded like he was either growling or yelling through all of his songs. But it wasn't solely Butler's fault. I really hated the way the Phantom was created to be a mere man. In the stage version, the Phantom is somewhat of a mystical being. We don't understand how he makes Carlotta's voice croak or how he makes the chandelier fall. He just does it. It made the Phantom one of the most engaging characters to be in theatre.

Butler's vocals don't pare up to the unparalleled Michael Crawford, but his acting is excellent, especially the Masquerade scene.Missed the full Red Death get-up, but I guess Butler's emoting would not have been as powerful talking through a huge skull-head!In the musical, the Phantom is always one step ahead and somewhat above the regular folks, adding to the mystery. He seems to perform almost magical stunts on several occasions, e.g. causing Carlotta's croaking, disappearing from Masquerade ball in a puff of smoke, shooting fireballs, gesturing the portcullis up, and the last scene disappearing act. We always felt like the Phantom had some supernatural element about him.Interestingly, ALW and Shumacher take pains to reveal the Phantom going through his machinations: Locking Christine's door, Meg revealing the sliding mirror, dropping through the floor from Masquerade ball where Raoul follows, and most obviously, the sword fight that he loses! Quite a difference from the stage version.Then, at the end, they bring back the magic. Had they ended with the Phantom simply escaping through a shattered mirror, it would have been a huge letdown.

I wound up loving this movie so much I had to buy it. I don't have anything negative to say about it. As a matter of fact it's one of the few times I find a movie better than the book.All the actors were great and it was well cast. I don't know how the original movie compares to this one but I doubt it was better. I also can not believe some of the negatives reviews here about Gerard and the movie. I am SHOCKED at how many people gave it 1 to 2 stars. Not because I am a fan of Gerard's, but If I didn't think he did a great job I would admit it, but Gerard was ""amazing' as the Phantom and I loved his singing. Actually I thought Gerard was way too handsome for the part but more than happy he was cast in the movie. And personally,I would've picked the Phantom over Raoul anytime if he looked anything like Gerard Butler, disfigured or not. I even purchased music from Itunes to my Ipod because I loved how Gerard sang. Yeah some people didn't like his singing but to each their own. If you listen to what the director said, they weren't looking for someone who sang great but obviously they liked his voice. If it was so bad I don't think he would've been cast for the part or they would've dubbed his voice. I am glad his singing was not dubbed,that would've been disapponinting for me.I also can't believe anyone would find Gerard Butler 'ugly'. wow. I guess the saying of 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder' really is true. Why someone or some people would even say that about him is very rude and immature. I could see if someone said they didn't find the man attractive but to call him 'ugly' is out of line. There really is no reason for name calling. Ever heard the saying 'If you can't say something nice about someone, don't say anything at all.' And that anyone would call him a bad actor is another shocker. I think he is one of the most talented actors out there. But that is my opinion.

In this case, namely the old-hollywood style screentest of leading lady Emmy Rostum and also the informal (he already had the job)presentation of Patrick's Wilson's vocal ability to the composer.  Only snippets are included in this package on the documentary of the making of the film.  This hurts the overall package, as does the lack of releasing to the audience more of the filming of the score and our actors singing their parts for the soundtrack in the recording studio.  Was this not to see the struggles with lead phantom?  The extras and also the casting of the phantom himself are why the DVD gets a 4 star rating from me.  The phantom is suitably virile and threatening and I have no problem with him in the part physically, but the lack of vocal ability of this performer - though he's rough-edged, this phantom, they could have hired a rough-edged though on-key singer (such as a new Roger Daltry) - makes for several cringing moments.  It's such a breath of fresh air for the listener when we're back to the professionals of Emmy R & Patrick W, who are the romantic leads.  They sing with such ease, every note is truly like an additional breath to them, it makes the audience even more aware of how the phantom is straining valiantly to keep his end up, and sometimes losing the battle.  A psychological preparation for how the phantom loses out to the smooth hero in the end? Regarding the film itself, I think it's achieved it's purpose of being an old-fashioned, though rock music oriented, beautiful vision.  It is, in fact, one of the more beautiful films to watch, so as eye-candy it fulfills it's obligations in the set design, costumes, cinematography and the two male leads.  One can clearly see the influence of the director's earlier film LOST BOYS in the night scenes and the lair of this phantom.  For Emmy Rostum, this will probably be the highlight of her career, featuring her spirit and her voice and professionalism.  It's hard to top this heroine for a role!

But, I suppose it would not be ever possible to reach higher than her perfect female lead role in Phantom.  The male role of the Phantom, played by Butler, is, by definition, the featured role, but she stole the show - as a teenager.

890419,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0007TKNI8,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 10]","Andrew Lloyd Weber must be spinning in his grave. Oh, wait. He's not dead. And he used his own money to produce the film version of his mega-hit musical ""Phantom of The Opera""? What went wrong?The Opera Populaire enjoys a loyal, devoted public. Unfortunately, they are being held hostage at the hands of a tempremental, egotistical chanteuse by the name of Carlotta (Minnie Driver). Fed up with all of the headaches, the owner of the Opera sells it to Firmin and Andre (Ciaran Hands and Simon Callow), two junk merchants eager to become respectable, backed by Raoul (Patrick Wilson), a young, rich benefactor. They soon have to find a replacement for Carlotta, and Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson), suggests Christine (Emmy Rossum), a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Phantom (Gerard Butler). She does an outstanding job, much to the delight of the Phantom. But the Phantom's demands, Raoul's growing attraction and other factors soon begin to play out with disastrous consequences.Andrew Lloyd Weber's ""Phantom of The Opera"" has become one of the most successful musicals of all time. It has played around the world, for extended periods, proving that it touches a large segment of the population. A film would seem inevitable. When someone is so closely identified with a piece of work, it makes sense that they would want to oversee every aspect of the film, to make sure `they got it right'. Weber used his own money to produce the film, presumably so he could retain control of the project.I know many of the fans were hoping Michael Crawford, who originated the role on Broadway, would be cast in the film. I was never able to see Crawford in the role, and saw a much later version in London, with someone I don't even remember. The musical was still fun, mesmerizing and a spectacle to watch. The film is mesmerizing and a spectacle, but not always for the right reasons.Instead, the filmmakers chose Gerard Butler (""Dear Frankie""), a little known Scottish actor for the role. I have seen Butler in a few other films and can recognize that he is actually doing the singing. He does a very good job; his voice has a deep timber that works well with the music. Emmy Rossum is certainly a beautiful young woman and she creates a character who is certainly timid and awed by her first appearance in an opera. However, I didn't think her singing voice was that much different from Carlotta's. Carlotta's voice is supposed to be horrible, ear screeching and embarrassingly bad. Christine's voice is certainly more pretty, but the character is not above trying to reach those high operatic notes which can sound like nails on a chalkboard to many. The voices of the two characters are not different enough to set the characters apart. Her voice is also drowned out in some of the more active areas. If she is singing with almost anyone else, she is almost always drowned out. Patrick Wilson is also very handsome, but again, his voice is not very strong.The acting between the three leads is very close to that of a play. In a play or musical, you have to take certain leaps of faith because you are unable to have scenes which provide insight into a characters thoughts or feelings, unless they are acting or singing these same thoughts. In a film, there are tricks and methods to reveal these things. In the film of ""Phantom"", the filmmaker sticks pretty closely to a theatrical model. Therefore, we have to believe that Raoul and Christine are attracted to each other after remembering they grew up together. They fall in love after singing to each other. Normal dramatic devices are thrown out the window. I think if you can take this leap of faith, you might enjoy the relationship between Christine and Raoul. The relationship between Christine and the Phantom is similar. She is naturally drawn to him as a mentor. But the relationship also has some creepy overtones. At one point, he pretends to be her father. Hello, Mr. Freud? Earlier, he has finished singing a song to her, romancing her, and shows her a wedding dress he has had made for her. A tad creepy. And not creepy in the right way.What doesn't work as well is the relationship between the three characters, the love triangle. Christine's admiration and love seems to flip flop between the two characters depending on whoever is currently singing to her. Naturally, Raoul and the Phantom want to beat the crap out of each other. At one point, as Raoul is about to kill the Phantom, Christine yells out ""No, not like this."" Well, why not? Because if he did kill the Phantom at that point, the story would end and they would liver happily ever after. But the filmmakers can't let that happen, they have about another hour of stuff they want to do, songs they want to sing.The song ""Masquerade"", which provides a key point in the stage production is a good example of what is wrong with the film version. ""Phantom"" is a lot more like the musicals the studios made in the 50s than it wants to be. With the recent releases of  ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago"", it tries to borrow a page from their success, but ends up creating a hodgepodge of a musical mess. ""Moulin Rouge"", which I loved and many hated, used a lot of rapid editing and pop culture songs to tell the story of a doomed relationship in early 20th Century Paris. ""Chicago"" slowed down the editing quite a bit and told a jazzier story. ""Phantom""'s lyrics and style are more like a rock opera but it's sensibilities lie more with films like ""Brigadoon"" or ""Meet Me In St. Louis"". ""Phantom"" desperately wants to be hipper than that, which is why director Joel Schumacher frequently cuts away from the action to weird, out of focus, quick shots. ""Masquerade"" is a good song and could clearly stand on its own. However, it is an old-fashioned musical number. People dance down a large staircase in a highly choreographed manner. Schumacher cuts away from this action to brief, quick shots of other dancers, some of which are out of focus. It's hip. It's young. It's MTV.Schumacher is the other major problem with ""Phantom"". The attention to detail and production design for the film are fantastic. From the opening segment, shot in black and white and created to look like old newsreel footage, to the color sequences in the old opera house, the film is a sight to behold. The black and white segment takes place in the opera house, many years later, when it is in disrepair. As they relight the fabled chandelier, the opera house quickly dusts itself off and we see it in all its grandeur and glory. The scene is magnificent and quickly clues us in to the fact that a lot of money was spent to recreate these sets. As the film progresses, we realize that Schumacher is in love with the production design. No, not in love. He has developed an unhealthy infatuation. Someone should have filed for a restraining order to keep him 100 yards away. As we first follow some characters through the backstage area, Schumacher's camera pans up and down, back and forth, to show us the extent of the set. This is necessary and useful to show us that this world is ""real"". However, he does this exact same movement more than once through the same set. Each time we visit a new area, his camera lingers over every detail. Look at this production design folks. It's brilliant. We get it, Joel. It quickly becomes tiring, repetitive and only serves to draw us out of the action and the world they tried so hard to recreate.Because of all of the excessive shots lingering on various pieces of the set, my boredom in the central relationships and my irritation with some of the singing, I changed the audio on the DVD to the French language track and turned on the English subtitles. You know what? I actually enjoyed the film more. The French singing was a little more beautiful and didn't detract from my experience. But I hardly believe this is what the filmmakers want us to do. Too bad they didn't have different angles on the DVD for me to switch between.If you are a huge fan of the play, you will probably enjoy this film version. If you aren't, skip it.

How this movie slipped through the Oscar cracks for costuming and design is a mystery, because this DVD is a visual marvel. The music is exquisite as well, there is little to moan about for reproduction. (Exception: Gerard Butler doesn't have much of a voice, but he does convey the damaged Phantom well.)That is the good. The bad is in the casting. As previously stated, Butler is sexy and menacing as a the Phantom, but he seemed to save his opera for300. Newcomer Emmy Rossum has a beautiful voice, but spends most of the time acting waxen and unemotive. The best casting is Minnie Driver, how hams it up hilariously. As Raul, Patrick Wilson fits his part well, but his voice seems boyishly thin. The Phantom should have been able to kick his butt at every turn, but somehow Raul leaves him behind every time, ever angrier.As a result, you are made to focus on the lavishness of the film itself. On that end, it succeeds handily. The Opera House is every bit as stunning as the sets in ""Moulin Rouge!"" and the music is the pure entertaining pop that Andrew Lloyd Weber has made himself rich creating. Colorful and vibrant, with the seediness of the backstage intact. If your looking for spectacle, ""Phantom"" delivers.

Anyways, I gave the film major points for the visuals. It's fantastic to look at. The sets are beautiful and the costumes are gorgeous. Emmy Rossum is likeable...I didn't hate her. Patrick Wilson I couldn't stand (he just plain irritated me), and the same goes for Gerard Butler (especially when Christine pulled his mask off...all of a sudden he's nearly bald, and half of his entire face is purple and scarred; at least Lon Chaney was genuinely frightening in that version...I didn't sleep for about 4 nights after I saw that). In all honesty, if the film really is an adaption of the stage play...then I don't want to see the play because it's not worth dropping 50 bucks to see it and then not like it (it was bad enough with 10.50). I don't think it's that well written. It wasn't playing to the original story's strengths and it should have. I was really upset to see that The Persian isn't in this, and that the torture chamber is completly cut out (ok not completely...Raoul is there for about half a second, but quickly leaves). I was disappointed because I was hearing only good things about it.

Having seen it on stage, albeit not with Michael Crawford, I didn't think that a movie could do it justice.  There is no comparison to listening to Andrew Lloyd Webbers music in real life.  However, the luscious scenery and costumes were terrific and the music was just as wonderful in film.  The only downfall was that you really need to experience yourself what it is like to watch the giant chandiler being hauled up over the audience.  I have been a great fan of Gerard Butler ever since seeing him in Attila.  He does make a strikingly handsome rough.  I was more than surprised and delighted beyond measure hearing him sing the music to this; so much so that I can't stand to listen to my tapes with Crawford singing it.  Emmy Rossum also is perfect Christine to Butlers hauntingly handsome, and tragic Phantom.  I have discovered that their singing along with Patrick Wilson's who plays Raoul is so much better than what I have heard before.  Minnie Driver is an absolute delight as Carlotta.  I found myself torn between which man I wanted Christine to go with in the end.  But, true to my fantasy of Gerard Butler, his portrayal of the Phantom made me root for him instead.  I just wanted to go through the screen and try and comfort this poor, lonely soul.

Gerard Butler (he looks like he stepped off the cover of a romance novel) has got to be the sexiest man alive. The reason I subtract one star is because no woman on earth would dare have us believe she would choose Raoul over the Phantom.  I almost died when I saw the ""Point of No Return.""  I think they had to hose down the set after that smoldering scene.  It is just hard to believe that Christine would leave the Phantom for a man who has the sex appeal of a tree.  But then I again, I suppose it's a movie, and the fairytale would not be acceptable if she ended up with the supposedly ""deformed"" man.The music is full of emotion, and I enjoyed the singing performances more than the Brightman/Crawford duo.  I think Emmy Rossum has a more pure and distinct voice than Brightman. Butler has the tragic tension (and loads of testosterone) that Crawford didn't quite convey to me.  I've seen the production on stage, and the movie is so much better.  You also don't have to pay $100 each time you watch it.  The sets are beautiful, and you can fast forward all the parts with Raoul singing to her in his feminine voice how he's going to protect her - PAH-LEESE!!.  He was so annoying.  Patrick Wilson (Raoul) is a talented singer, but he emerges with poor acting skills for a movie production, and we never feel the attraction between himself and Christine.

890433,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0007TKNI8,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a fairly close film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's famous musical by the same name. The movie opens in a black and white, reminiscent of an old movie newsreel. It's 1919 and the Paris Opera House is dilapidated. Items from opera poster to music boxes to the famed chandelier are being auctioned off. As the chandelier rises for the bidders to see, the theatre is restored to its magnificent and colorful glory and the audience is transported in time to 1871. The story goes something like this. A young orphaned girl, Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum), is raised in the opera house. In her dreams she is taught music lesson by what she believes is the Angel of Music that her dying father promised he would send to her. In reality, her teacher is the Opera's infamous Phantom, a man seldom seen but whose presence is always felt and known. The Phantom (Gerard Butler) has been tutoring Christine not only so that she can one day become the opera's star, but also so that she will one day become his wife. The Phantom has a physical deformity that (in this version) that has horribly scarred half his face. Things start off well and Christine finally gets her big moment to shine. But then her old boyfriend shows up and things escalate from there. The Phantom is torn by rage and the two-faced nature of his soul, represented by his disfigured face, causes lots of havoc. But things have a mostly happy ending.The movie follows the plot of the musical it's based on fairly well. There are some minor changes in plot done for more dramatic effect, but overall the story structure is the same. The costumes and set design of the film are magnificent and the acting is superb. Rossum looks like Christine and she sings well. Actually, most of the singing in the movie is good.However, there are a few things that I felt distracted from the overall flow of the film. Gerard Butler is a great actor and has a nice voice. However, his voice just isn't right for The Phantom. At times I think it sounds too high and other times it sounds too low. It's not that he doesn't sing well, because he does. However, his vocal talents just weren't adapted well to capture the physical passion and spiritual torture that embodies every syllable The Phantom speaks (or in this case, sings). Also, Butler looks almost the same age as Rossum. The Phantom is someone twice Christine's age and in the movie he looks like a big brother instead of the elder tutor and father-figure he's supposed to be.Also, only part of the Phantom's face is disfigured. Actually, it's about 1/4th of his face. For the duality approach that the film seems to be going for it would have been nice to see at least a full 1/2 of his face scarred. However, what the filmmakers did does fit because in the end the Phantom does the right thing. It's just that through most of the film there's this whole two-faced, dual nature motif going on and the face is a huge part of that. I think if exactly 1/2 his face was scarred it would have made The Phantom's final act even more poignant.In the movie, most of the singing between Christine and Raoul has been reduced to dialogue. I'm not sure about the reasoning behind this. Patrick Wilson (Raoul) seemed to be a decent enough singer and should have been able to handle the vocal challenges. Perhaps it was done to appeal to a wider audience. Who knows?Finally, there is the Masquerade scene. The attendees are mostly dressed in black and white costumes with the occasional dash of gold. The Phantom makes his appearance in a Masque of the Red Death costume, but other than that there isn't much color. Masquerades are usually colorful and it would have been nice to see some of that color during that scene.There are several allusions in the movie to other Webber works and to the original PHANTOM OF THE OPERA novel by Gaston Leroux. For instance, the horse that the Phantom places Christine on is an allusion to a scene in the novel that is almost identical and when the theatre owners are told to &#34;grovel, grovel&#34; the music and lyrics are almost identical to a piece in JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT (another Webber musical).Overall, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a delight to watch. Joel Schumacher often messes things up when he directs, but for once he got things right and made a film that though full of excess, is also beautiful and meaningful.",4,Think of Me,1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,4402,"['PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'fairly', 'close', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'famous', 'musical', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'movie', 'newsreel', '1919', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'House', 'dilapidated', 'Items', 'opera', 'poster', 'music', 'boxes', 'famed', 'chandelier', 'are', 'being', 'auctioned', 'off', 'chandelier', 'bidders', 'see', 'theatre', 'restored', 'magnificent', 'colorful', 'glory', 'audience', 'transported', 'time', '1871', 'story', 'something', 'young', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'Christine', 'Daae', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'raised', 'opera', 'house', 'dreams', 'taught', 'music', 'lesson', 'what', 'Angel', 'Music', 'dying', 'father', 'promised', 'would', 'send', 'reality', 'teacher', 'Opera', 'infamous', 'Phantom', 'man', 'seldom', 'seen', 'presence', 'always', 'felt', 'known', 'Phantom', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'been', 'tutoring', 'Christine', 'not', 'only', 'so', 'can', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'opera', 'star', 'also', 'so', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'wife', 'Phantom', 'physical', 'deformity', 'version', 'horribly', 'scarred', 'face', 'Things', 'start', 'off', 'well', 'Christine', 'finally', 'big', 'moment', 'shine', 'then', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'up', 'things', 'escalate', 'there', 'Phantom', 'torn', 'rage', 'two-faced', 'nature', 'soul', 'represented', 'disfigured', 'face', 'lots', 'havoc', 'things', 'have', 'mostly', 'happy', 'ending.The', 'movie', 'plot', 'musical', 'based', 'fairly', 'well', 'are', 'minor', 'changes', 'plot', 'done', 'more', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'story', 'structure', 'same', 'costumes', 'set', 'design', 'film', 'are', 'magnificent', 'acting', 'superb', 'Rossum', 'Christine', 'well', 'Actually', 'most', 'singing', 'movie', 'good.However', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'felt', 'distracted', 'overall', 'flow', 'film', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'great', 'actor', 'nice', 'voice', 'However', 'voice', 'just', ""n't"", 'right', 'Phantom', 'times', 'think', 'too', 'high', 'other', 'times', 'too', 'low', 'not', ""n't"", 'sing', 'well', 'However', 'vocal', 'talents', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'adapted', 'well', 'capture', 'physical', 'passion', 'spiritual', 'torture', 'syllable', 'Phantom', 'speaks', 'case', 'sings', 'Also', 'Butler', 'almost', 'same', 'age', 'Rossum', 'Phantom', 'someone', 'twice', 'Christine', 'age', 'movie', 'big', 'brother', 'instead', 'elder', 'tutor', 'father-figure', 'supposed', 'be.Also', 'only', 'part', 'Phantom', 'face', 'disfigured', 'Actually', '1/4th', 'face', 'duality', 'approach', 'film', 'be', 'going', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'least', 'full', '1/2', 'face', 'scarred', 'However', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'fit', 'end', 'Phantom', 'right', 'thing', 'just', 'most', 'film', 'whole', 'two-faced', 'dual', 'nature', 'motif', 'going', 'face', 'huge', 'part', 'think', 'exactly', '1/2', 'face', 'was', 'scarred', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Phantom', 'final', 'act', 'even', 'more', 'poignant.In', 'movie', 'most', 'singing', 'Christine', 'Raoul', 'been', 'reduced', 'dialogue', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'reasoning', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Raoul', 'seemed', 'be', 'decent', 'enough', 'singer', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'handle', 'vocal', 'challenges', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'done', 'appeal', 'wider', 'audience', 'Who', 'Finally', 'Masquerade', 'scene', 'attendees', 'are', 'mostly', 'dressed', 'black', 'white', 'costumes', 'occasional', 'dash', 'gold', 'Phantom', 'appearance', 'Masque', 'Red', 'Death', 'costume', 'other', ""n't"", 'much', 'color', 'Masquerades', 'are', 'usually', 'colorful', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'color', 'are', 'several', 'allusions', 'movie', 'other', 'Webber', 'works', 'original', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'novel', 'Gaston', 'Leroux', 'instance', 'horse', 'Phantom', 'places', 'Christine', 'allusion', 'scene', 'novel', 'almost', 'identical', 'when', 'theatre', 'owners', 'are', 'told', '34', 'grovel', 'grovel', '34', 'music', 'lyrics', 'are', 'almost', 'identical', 'piece', 'JOSEPH', 'THE', 'AMAZING', 'TECHNICOLOR', 'DREAMCOAT', 'Webber', 'musical', '.Overall', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'delight', 'watch', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'often', 'things', 'up', 'when', 'once', 'got', 'things', 'right', 'made', 'film', 'full', 'excess', 'also', 'beautiful', 'meaningful']",N/A

890436,A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7,B0007TKNI8,Unlucky Frank,"[5, 6]","My last girlfriend played the Original London Cast soundtrack incessantly in our living room. I saw the play twice. Once with Crawford and once with Guillaume. I thought it was okay for a broadway musical and even though I knew a lot of the words by heart, I always thought her obsession for THE PHANTOM was a bit extreme. But, nothing would prepare me for the emotional impact of seeing this musical brought to the screen. It knocked me out BIG TIME. This film is emotional dynamite. Especially the roof scene and the ending.I think the reason so many fans of THE PHANTOM say they like the movie better is that film is a very visual and personal medium. The space and remoteness of a stage is completely done away with when a musical is brought to the widescreen. We get to share in the actors emotional reactions to the singing that they project. I was raised on MGM musicals and have always preferred them to stage musicals. Even though some of the excitement of the LIVE event is lost while viewing a film. This is not the case with the film version of THE PHANTOM. It's BREATHTAKING to say the least. I was also able to understand almost every word in the film version, while I only understood about 2 thirds of the vocal articulation of the stage play. And unlike the play, I was completely MOVED the first, second, and third viewing of the film. And now I'm just as obsessed with PHANTOM as my girlfriend was. OH, GOD!! I'M GAY!!This has now become my second favorite film musical following WEST SIDE STORY, while knocking SINGING IN THE RAIN into a distance third place. THIS FILM IS THAT GOOD!! It's so lavish and beautiful to look at, I'm completely at a loss as to why it didn't win Best Picture, let alone to not even be nominated for it. PLEASE!! This was hands down the BEST FILM OF 2004. If Mr. Peabody sent us back to the 40'S, 50's, or 60's in his Wayback Machine when musicals were beloved, this film would have captured at least some of the 10 Oscars that went to WEST SIDE STORY in 1960. It's just as moving as that film. And unlike those old Marny Nixon dubbed vocal days, almost all of the cast do their own singing. Amazing!! MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a great film, but this is an INSTANT CLASSIC!! In ten years time, most people will have forgotten that film, but I'm sure I'll be viewing THIS every Sunday night, (which is now WEST SIDE STORY night in my house,) for years to come. Man, Hollywood sure has changed.In one of the Documentary Features on the 2 Disc DVD, Andrew Lloyd Webber stated that this was the way he always envisioned his PHANTOM. I agree!! He must be stoked!!

890438,A1H5E7O5BW2J13,B0007TKNI8,V.C.,"[4, 8]","I feel very glad that i had seen Phantom of the Opera on Broadway twice in my lifetime. Seeing Phantom on stage is a wonderful experience: the scenery, the theatrics, the music, the singing, the acting, the emotion, and the heart and character that makes this musical very moving and affective. And yes, the movie does capture the scenery and theatrical aspect of the show very well. But the main problem is the lack of emotion in the music, the singing, the acting, the emotion, and the heart and soul of the play. First of all, the soundtrack for this movie sounds very wooden, and it doesn't make a big bang on songs like ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""The Music of the Night"" as it did originally. The acting: so, so. I just thought at times that there was not enough acting involved to actually make you connect with the characters. At times the roles of the main characters (including the Phantom himself) was cringing and dull to the point where i wished that the movie was going to end! The main problem i have about this film is the way the phantom is portrayed: handsome and charming, with porcelain skin, a flawless body, and very nice hair. Now, is this the type of phantom that we are expected to believe is conniving, grotesque, and hideous? I mean seriously, at times i thought he was Zoro or Ben Affleck. Even when the mask is revealed you question what the big fuss is about. What was supposed to be a monster looking creature was instead a suave actor that had a bad hair day and a bad rash and sun burn. One word: LAME. It's just disappointing. Not only was it distracting, but it was simply annoying. At that point you feel less intimidated by the phantom, and feel less and less convinced that this phantom is worth the screams that the characters give in his presence. I can go on and on about the flaws of this film really. The only good qualities about this film is the look of the film, it's well done and doesn't look cheap or overdone. But what it does well on the glammor of the costumes and stage setting is horribly lacking or missing on what should really matter: the emotion.",3,"High Expectations, Expectations Not Delivered",1117670400,"06 2, 2005",2005,2104,"['feel', 'very', 'glad', 'i', 'had', 'seen', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Broadway', 'twice', 'lifetime', 'Seeing', 'Phantom', 'stage', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'scenery', 'theatrics', 'music', 'singing', 'acting', 'emotion', 'heart', 'character', 'musical', 'very', 'moving', 'affective', 'yes', 'movie', 'capture', 'scenery', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'show', 'very', 'well', 'main', 'problem', 'lack', 'emotion', 'music', 'singing', 'acting', 'emotion', 'heart', 'soul', 'play', 'First', 'all', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'very', 'wooden', ""n't"", 'make', 'big', 'bang', 'songs', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Music', 'Night', 'did', 'originally', 'acting', 'so', 'just', 'thought', 'times', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'acting', 'involved', 'actually', 'make', 'connect', 'characters', 'times', 'roles', 'main', 'characters', 'including', 'Phantom', 'was', 'cringing', 'dull', 'point', 'where', 'i', 'wished', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'main', 'problem', 'i', 'have', 'film', 'way', 'phantom', 'portrayed', 'handsome', 'charming', 'porcelain', 'skin', 'flawless', 'body', 'very', 'nice', 'hair', 'Now', 'type', 'phantom', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'conniving', 'grotesque', 'hideous', 'mean', 'seriously', 'times', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'Zoro', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Even', 'when', 'mask', 'revealed', 'question', 'what', 'big', 'fuss', 'about', 'What', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'monster', 'looking', 'creature', 'was', 'instead', 'suave', 'actor', 'had', 'bad', 'hair', 'day', 'bad', 'rash', 'sun', 'burn', 'One', 'word', 'LAME', 'just', 'disappointing', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'distracting', 'was', 'simply', 'annoying', 'point', 'feel', 'less', 'intimidated', 'phantom', 'feel', 'less', 'less', 'convinced', 'phantom', 'screams', 'characters', 'give', 'presence', 'can', 'go', 'flaws', 'film', 'really', 'only', 'good', 'qualities', 'film', 'look', 'film', 'well', 'done', ""n't"", 'look', 'cheap', 'overdone', 'what', 'well', 'glammor', 'costumes', 'stage', 'setting', 'horribly', 'lacking', 'missing', 'should', 'really', 'matter', 'emotion']",N/A

He is all at once dark, dangerous, sensuous, sexy, tortured, tormented and oh so human. His singing so full of raw emotion and passion moves my very soul and is not to be missed. The music through out the whole movie is lush and powerful and stays with you so you may wish to order the soundtrack when you get the movie. Though do keep in mind that this is a very tragic story of great love and loss, betrayal of that love and of sacrifice for that love, so do keep a box of kleenex handy. Make that a large box of kleenex if you relate to the Phantoms' heartbreak and pain, which I think is a given based on Gerard Butler's amazing potrayal of the Phantom. I still cry every time I watch this movie and I am well on my way to triple digits for the number of times I have watched it and to me it is still just as magnificent and haunting as the very first time I saw it.

I was not prepared for what I experienced with this movie--why it didn't sweep the Academy Awards in 2004 I'll never know.  It is a magnificent production and I think even better than the stage version. I am frequently disappointed with movies since it is difficult for film to do justice to a book or classic, but that is not the case with Phantom.  Beautiful music, an absolutely fantastic cast, great direction and screen writing, editing, beautiful costumes, make-up, set design, cinematology, and sets--it has it all.  I was immediately swept up with the poignant story and must admit I was rooting with tears in my eyes for Christine to stay with the Phantom and bring love and beauty into his life. Just as an aside, I think it was brilliant making the phantom's face a genetic anomalie rather than Hollywood's usual horror-show monster.  You could understand the loneliness, rejection and isolation of the phantom and his desire for love and acceptance by the beautiful Christine.  Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy and now this production of Phantom of the Opera are my absolute favorite movies of all times.  I was mesmerized by this film--this is the quinessential phantom of the opera and will be the production against which all productions will be compared.  Think of The King and I and you think of Yul Brenner--indeed it is hard to imagine a production of The King and I which is not Yul Brenner in the lead.  This production will be the same to Phantom of the Opera.  It is a classic and I plan to view it again and again--I don't think it could have been done better!  This film is a must-see and is a keeper--as far as I am concerned it is the definitive Phantom of the Opera!

890446,A1C80B497LCYKA,B0007TKNI8,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[4, 4]","First, you have to like musicals. Second, you have to like the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Third, you have to understand that a movie is a different animal from a stage play. And fourth, you have to be open to a different, younger interpretation of the story than the stage version. If you accept those four conditions, you will love this film.The two-disc special edition is well worth the extra money. There are two extensive features: one tells the story of how the stage musical came to be; the second, how the film originated and developed. If you ever had a question about either the play or the film, they're answered here.In taking Phantom from stage to screen - making it the most expensive independent film in history - Webber increased his orchestra to over 100 pieces. So the music has never sounded better, making the CD equally necessary for the Phantom fan. In addition, he wanted to use a rock-and-roll voice for the Phantom, rather than a trained voice like Michael Crawford - thus, the choice of Gerard Butler (Dear Frankie, Beowulf and Grendel) for the role. This is probably the stickiest point for Phantom fans that expected the rich tones of a Crawford or Hart. But Butler does an admirable job. My only complaint is that he is so covered up with mask, wig, makeup and costume that there is very little of Butler left to look at. If you've seen him in other films, he has a strong masculine look. So you get little more than his voice. But even with those restrictions, he creates an emotionally appealing Phantom.It was director Joel Schumacher's (Batman Forever, Phone Booth, The Lost Boys) idea to give Phantom a younger cast and look, so that it would appeal to younger audiences. Part of his justification was that Christine is so nave and innocent, how could she not be younger. Emmy Rossum (The Day After Tomorrow, An American Rhapsody) fills the role perfectly, with a beautifully mesmerizing face and equally beautiful voice - though not with the vocal strength of a Sarah Brightman, for whom Webber wrote the role as a testament to his love. Patrick Wilson (Oklahoma on Broadway, The Alamo), as Raoul, fills out the three main principals, and is probably the most solid of the group, both dramatically and vocally, though his role is the smallest.The supporting cast is equally stunning, headed by Miranda Richardson as a compelling Madam Giry; Minnie Driver as a delightfully self-obsessed Carlotta (dubbed vocally by Margaret Preece - except for the final, hauntingly beautiful credits song, ""Learn To Be Lonely,"" which was nominated for an Oscar); Ciaran Hinds as flamboyant opera owner Firmin; Simon Callow as Andre his partner; Jennifer Ellison as winsome Meg Giry; and Kevin McNally as devious Buquet.The production design by Anthony Pratt (2001: A Space Odyssey) is exquisitely colorful - certainly romantic, but not gothic or scary enough for many Phantom fans, even though it was nominated for an Oscar. The cinematography by John Mathieson (Gladiator) was also nominated, and is breathtaking, for the most part, with many standouts, including the ""Overture,"" the transition in ""Think of Me,"" ""Prima Donna,"" ""All I Ask of You"" (rooftop scene), and the chandelier crash; as well as the grainy black-and-white sequences. My favorite is the shot at the end of ""Prima Donna,"" in which the camera cranes back from the stage, through the curtain and into the house, with the curtain closing behind it. That shot was masterful, and one of the finest in film history, in my opinion.It is no easy task bringing a stage musical to the screen. They rarely succeed. Most successful movie musicals (e.g., Sound Of Music, Singin' In The Rain, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, An American In Paris) were written for the screen. There are exceptions: My Fair Lady and West Side Story; but it's always a gamble. In spite of the critics, I think Phantom is one of the better ones.

For the past fortnight I've been watching the 25th Anniversary telecast on PBS, and this led to my becoming truly obsessed with this musical.  Thus I have order two copies of the movie here at Amazon, plus the two-disc soundtrack, and I am leaning on ordering the Original London Cast cd.I was instantly captivated by this film, and I think it is an excellent cinematic interpretation of the stage play.  All of the acting is superb, especially Gerard Butler and Minnie Driver.  Butler's singing leaves a bit to be desired, but I was not aware of that as I watched the film, being so utterly captivated by his film persona, his beauty and his powerful performance.  His beauty is, of course, questionable in this role;  yet he makes the Phantom a monster in action if not entirely in appearance.The finest aspect of the film is that we hear the score with a film orchestra, and thus, for me, the music is enhanced in beauty and magnificence.  The changes from the stage production work extremely well.  A cinematic version should not be a duplicate of a stage production -- they are entirely different mediums.The film is powerful and imaginative, an excellent rendition of a romantic classic.  The music, written by a man in love for the woman of his dreams, captures the essence of romance.  I love this film and will be watching it again tonight.  And perhaps tomorrow night as well.  The only ""defect"" is that the disc won't play on my laptop DVD player, and I would love to experience the entire film really loud on headphones,in deep darkness with just the images of the film before me.",5,Haunting,1331683200,"03 14, 2012",2012,1672,"['saw', 'stage', 'production', 'here', 'Seattle', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'amazed', 'past', 'fortnight', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'telecast', 'PBS', 'led', 'becoming', 'truly', 'obsessed', 'musical', 'Thus', 'have', 'order', 'two', 'copies', 'movie', 'here', 'Amazon', 'two-disc', 'soundtrack', 'am', 'leaning', 'ordering', 'Original', 'London', 'Cast', 'cd.I', 'was', 'instantly', 'captivated', 'film', 'think', 'excellent', 'cinematic', 'interpretation', 'stage', 'play', 'acting', 'superb', 'especially', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Butler', 'singing', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'watched', 'film', 'being', 'so', 'utterly', 'captivated', 'film', 'persona', 'beauty', 'powerful', 'performance', 'beauty', 'course', 'questionable', 'role', 'Phantom', 'monster', 'action', 'not', 'entirely', 'appearance.The', 'finest', 'aspect', 'film', 'hear', 'score', 'film', 'orchestra', 'thus', 'music', 'enhanced', 'beauty', 'magnificence', 'changes', 'stage', 'production', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'A', 'cinematic', 'version', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'duplicate', 'stage', 'production', 'are', 'entirely', 'different', 'mediums.The', 'film', 'powerful', 'imaginative', 'excellent', 'rendition', 'romantic', 'classic', 'music', 'written', 'man', 'love', 'woman', 'dreams', 'essence', 'romance', 'love', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'tonight', 'perhaps', 'tomorrow', 'night', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'defect', 'disc', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'laptop', 'DVD', 'player', 'would', 'love', 'experience', 'entire', 'film', 'really', 'loud', 'headphones', 'deep', 'darkness', 'just', 'images', 'film']",N/A

I was so thrilled to see it, because I had to sing some of the songs in the choir in high school, but never got to see it on broadway.My knowledge of the story was vague at the time, but I certainly loved the music, and the songs include The Music of The Night, Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again, and The Point of No Return.This is by far the most visually stunning film I've seen this year, and they have done a great deal of work on the sets and costumes. So it's no doubt an eye candy. The music and the performances were absolutely dazzling. I didn't find a single moment in this film to be boring.Miranda Richardson gives another marvellous supporting performance as Madame Giry, who rescued The Phantom when he was in captivity as a young boy, and ever since he lived underground. She eventually send Christine to meet him, and secretly learn to sing under his guidance. And when the time came for the replacement of Carlotta's leading role in the opera house, Christine was the perfect choice. She was able to steal scenes with her French accent and the way she uses her eyes that ultimately stood out in group scenes.Minnie Driver plays Carlotta, a super-snob diva with a bizzare Italian accent, and she is more glamorous than she was in Beautiful. She gets to sing off key in a tightly cinched corset, and she was the comic relief in this film. After 5 seasons as a lead, she was bound to be replaced by the more talented and well-trained and unknown Christine. She actually just lipsyned the songs and it was dubbed by a professional opera singer named Margaret Preece.Emmy Rossum is wonderful as Christine, and she's stunning when she gets to perform Think Of Me on stage. Althogh she's unknown to mainstream audiences, but she had previously done a wonderful supporting role in Songcatcher. She's torn between her longtime boyfriend Raoul, played by Patrick Wilson and The Phantom. She's grateful for The Phantom for teaching her to become a great singer, but her heart belongs to Raoul. The Phantom loves her, and wants her to leave Raoul, or else....Gerard Butler's role slowly intensifies and he's broken hearted when Christine chose to leave him, depite the fact that he would cause a disaster to the opera house. There's a great deal of chemistry between Rossum and him, but he has less screen time compared to her. I am totally sympathetic towards his character, because the world treated him like a monster, simply for his distorted face. I was thought if they didn't cast Butler, they could definitely cast Antonio Banderas.Patrick Wilson is also great as Raoul who ultimately takes Christine home. I didn't like his character, and I thought that The Phantom should have killed him even if Christine didn't want to stay.As a musical film, I honestly think it's better than Moulin Rouge and Chicago, even though it doesn't have superstars like Nicole Kidman or Renne Zellwegger to carry it. I equally enjoyed Andrew Lloyd Webber's film version of Evita(Madonna).",5,"Surrender yourself to the music, elaborate sets, and cast!",1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,3046,"['Finally', 'most', 'popular', 'musical', 'made', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'thrilled', 'see', 'had', 'sing', 'songs', 'choir', 'high', 'school', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'broadway.My', 'knowledge', 'story', 'was', 'vague', 'time', 'certainly', 'loved', 'music', 'songs', 'include', 'Music', 'Night', 'Wishing', 'Were', 'Somehow', 'Here', 'Again', 'Point', 'No', 'Return.This', 'far', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'deal', 'work', 'sets', 'costumes', 'doubt', 'eye', 'candy', 'music', 'performances', 'were', 'absolutely', 'dazzling', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'single', 'moment', 'film', 'be', 'boring.Miranda', 'Richardson', 'marvellous', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'who', 'rescued', 'Phantom', 'when', 'was', 'captivity', 'young', 'boy', 'ever', 'lived', 'underground', 'eventually', 'send', 'Christine', 'meet', 'secretly', 'learn', 'sing', 'guidance', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'replacement', 'Carlotta', 'leading', 'role', 'opera', 'house', 'Christine', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'was', 'able', 'steal', 'scenes', 'French', 'accent', 'way', 'eyes', 'ultimately', 'stood', 'out', 'group', 'scenes.Minnie', 'Driver', 'Carlotta', 'super-snob', 'diva', 'bizzare', 'Italian', 'accent', 'more', 'glamorous', 'was', 'Beautiful', 'sing', 'off', 'key', 'tightly', 'cinched', 'corset', 'was', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', '5', 'seasons', 'lead', 'was', 'bound', 'be', 'replaced', 'more', 'talented', 'well-trained', 'unknown', 'Christine', 'actually', 'just', 'lipsyned', 'songs', 'was', 'dubbed', 'professional', 'opera', 'singer', 'named', 'Margaret', 'Preece.Emmy', 'Rossum', 'wonderful', 'Christine', 'stunning', 'when', 'perform', 'Think', 'Me', 'stage', 'Althogh', 'unknown', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'had', 'previously', 'done', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'role', 'Songcatcher', 'torn', 'longtime', 'boyfriend', 'Raoul', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Phantom', 'grateful', 'Phantom', 'teaching', 'become', 'great', 'singer', 'heart', 'Raoul', 'Phantom', 'leave', 'Raoul', 'else', '.Gerard', 'Butler', 'role', 'slowly', 'intensifies', 'broken', 'hearted', 'when', 'Christine', 'chose', 'leave', 'depite', 'fact', 'would', 'cause', 'disaster', 'opera', 'house', 'great', 'deal', 'chemistry', 'Rossum', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'compared', 'am', 'totally', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'character', 'world', 'treated', 'monster', 'simply', 'distorted', 'face', 'was', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'cast', 'Butler', 'could', 'definitely', 'cast', 'Antonio', 'Banderas.Patrick', 'Wilson', 'also', 'great', 'Raoul', 'who', 'ultimately', 'Christine', 'home', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'character', 'thought', 'Phantom', 'should', 'have', 'killed', 'even', 'Christine', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'stay.As', 'musical', 'film', 'honestly', 'think', 'better', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Chicago', 'even', ""n't"", 'have', 'superstars', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Renne', 'Zellwegger', 'carry', 'equally', 'enjoyed', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'film', 'version', 'Evita', 'Madonna']",N/A

The music is what holds the story together, I believe.  The score and the lyrics are the essence of the entire story.  In spite of there not being a full orchestra in the play, there were organs and synthesizers to round out the sound.  The film version seems thinner - in spite of a full orchestra, and the play seemed richer because of the greater variety of instruments.  Listening to the two soundtracks actually lead me to believe that the play had the larger orchestra.The singing was good.  Other than the small percentage of theater-goers who actually got to see Brightman and Crawford, there were many different Phantoms and Cristines around the world.  Yes, every Phantom can be compared to Crawford.  Crawford had a timbre in his voice that could not be matched by anyone else.  In the movie, I don't believe they even tried.  They found a very competent singer who had a stage ""presence"" which overcame any of his singing shortcomings.  I found him far more effective as the Phantom.The second disk was great.  It allowed an insight into the struggles to put together a play according to Andrew's vision - after he had read the original book.  Things like the songs and music constantly evolving over the years of stage performances was an insight I would not have known.  I had only seen the play twice in Boston at fairly close intervals.The play stayed with me since that time.  It is haunting and ethereal.  It is dramatic and sad.

When I watched this movie, I was just swept away.  The movie was excellent, the music was right on, the costumes and scenary were beautiful, and the main characters were very true to form.  If some people would have preferred to have Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford in the lead roles, I would like to remind them that those two famous singers played the role of Christine and the Phantom almost 20 years ago.  In this story, Christine is only 16, and up close with a movie camera, Sarah Brightman would have been unconvincing.  I am astonished that they found Emmy Rossum, who not only sings shockingly well (Sarah Brightman's London cast recording is the best, but Ms. Rossum was very good), but is also so ethereally beautiful and fits the role so perfectly and was only 16 at filming!  The Phantom was strong, mysterious and sexy, so much that the brave and loving Raoul was only a close second.  One reader commented that the Phantom's mask only covered part of his right face, but when the mask came off, most of his right face and head was disfigured.  I would note that the Phantom had several nice brunette wigs on his dresser, which would have covered the disfigured head areas and made him look nicer.The movie itself is very beautiful, and the movie format allowed us to see up and down the theatre, and gave greater depth to the musical story. On stage, the characters of the Phantom were seen at a distance.  With a movie camera, it allows us to see the characters up close (so that a 40+ year old Sarah Brightman would have been unconvincing as the young ingenue), and the sets really elaborated at the sets we saw on stage.  Watching the movie, I understood the plot much better and the singing seemed very natural.  For example, we meet the dancing instructor, the theatre stage hand, the two theatre owners, and follow their important roles in the story.  I especialy liked Carlotta as the spoiled musical tyrant.  The theatre was truly sumptuous.  The complicated scenes with the letters from the Phantom is easier to follow in movie format.  If Christine Daae is not the deepest female role, I would only note that Andrew Lloyd Webber did not create a particularly deep or rich role in the Christine; she's primarily beautiful, young, sings like a dream and strangely caught in love and/or mesmerized by two different men. The Phantom was dark, tormented, sexy and oddly pitiable, yet also contemptible with what he did to some people.  Raoul is the rich, loving knight in shining armour.  I thought the plot and tension between the three main characters, Christine, Phantom and Raoul, were great, and the romance was such that I was guessing at the ending until the very end (even though I've seen the stage production!)

890459,AMMEMPM9MPS55,B0007TKNI8,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[1, 5]","The long-awaited film of Andrew Lloyd-Webber's musical is not perfect, but director Schumacher surprises us enough to turn out perhaps the best of several screen versions of the famous tale.On the negative side, the two leads (Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum) lack vocal strength: His singing voice is annoyingly grating at times; and she sings through her nose too much. The visual style is a tad inconsistent, with Christine and the Phantom's first descent into the underworld looking too much like a pop video, and some of the more frenetic, Moulin-Rouge-inspired camerawork lacking in life. The additions occasionally detract from the flow, especially the unnecessary flashback to the Phantom's adolescence.In its favour is much, however. Lloyd-Webber's vision was always the most faithful to the original story, capturing Leroux's romance and fantasy as well as the horror. Despite the lack of vocal strength, Butler excels dramatically as a tortured anti-hero who invites compassion and understanding as well as terror; the tension between his tragic loneliness and his violent hatred against humanity is well-conveyed. Among the support, I most enjoyed Miranda Richardson's Madame Giry and Simon Callow's Andre.The new orchestrations do the music justice. The choreography, like the visual style, is inconsistent, but there are nevertheless some truly splendid numbers, staged with an eye for spectacle as well as a good sense of humour (e.g. Prima Donna). For the most part, despite the very obvious influence, Schumacher avoids mimicking the chaotic pace of Moulin Rouge, and the camera work is generally subtle at the right times.All the layers of the story are held nicely in balance, making The Phantom of the Opera a moving romantic fantasy, and very much the exhilarating experience that the stage show has always been.",4,"Flawed, but quite possibly the finest of many adaptations",1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,1831,"['long-awaited', 'film', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd-Webber', 'musical', 'not', 'perfect', 'director', 'Schumacher', 'enough', 'turn', 'out', 'perhaps', 'best', 'several', 'screen', 'versions', 'famous', 'tale.On', 'negative', 'side', 'two', 'leads', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'lack', 'vocal', 'strength', 'singing', 'voice', 'annoyingly', 'grating', 'times', 'nose', 'too', 'much', 'visual', 'style', 'tad', 'inconsistent', 'Christine', 'Phantom', 'first', 'descent', 'underworld', 'looking', 'too', 'much', 'pop', 'video', 'more', 'frenetic', 'Moulin-Rouge-inspired', 'camerawork', 'lacking', 'life', 'additions', 'occasionally', 'detract', 'flow', 'especially', 'unnecessary', 'flashback', 'Phantom', 'adolescence.In', 'favour', 'much', 'however', 'Lloyd-Webber', 'vision', 'was', 'always', 'most', 'faithful', 'original', 'story', 'capturing', 'Leroux', 'romance', 'fantasy', 'as', 'well', 'horror', 'lack', 'vocal', 'strength', 'Butler', 'dramatically', 'tortured', 'anti-hero', 'who', 'compassion', 'understanding', 'as', 'well', 'terror', 'tension', 'tragic', 'loneliness', 'violent', 'hatred', 'humanity', 'well-conveyed', 'support', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Andre.The', 'new', 'orchestrations', 'do', 'music', 'justice', 'choreography', 'visual', 'style', 'inconsistent', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'truly', 'splendid', 'numbers', 'staged', 'eye', 'spectacle', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'sense', 'humour', 'e.g', 'Prima', 'Donna', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'obvious', 'influence', 'Schumacher', 'mimicking', 'chaotic', 'pace', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'camera', 'work', 'generally', 'subtle', 'right', 'layers', 'story', 'are', 'held', 'nicely', 'balance', 'making', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'moving', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'very', 'much', 'exhilarating', 'experience', 'stage', 'show', 'always', 'been']",N/A

I loved this version though, the music, the plot, the acting, everything was ""phantastic"". Although if you don't like musicals don't even try watching this film most of it is sung. I loved the entire movie and I don't think one part of it was out-of-step or wrong. Although I have never been a big fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber I was surprisingly pleased with this movie.",5,Phantastic!!!,1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,496,"['did', 'not', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'version', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'one', 'was', 'better', 'loved', 'version', 'music', 'plot', 'acting', 'everything', 'was', 'phantastic', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'musicals', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'watching', 'film', 'most', 'sung', 'loved', 'entire', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'part', 'was', 'out-of-step', 'wrong', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'pleased', 'movie']",N/A

Cao ""Fallingwater""","[3, 4]","This is the best movie I had ever seen in my life.My words run dry and astonished by the dreamlike atmosphere Webber created. I think the Phantom was the most impressive figure I have ever seen in any movies. His passionate but desperate voice makes the tragic hero even more rivetted. And Wilson also did a good job as that handsome Raoul,although he looks a little bit naive. The dress he wore on the masquerade remind me a scene of &lt;&lt; The Beauty and The Beast>>. If I were Christine, I really cannot make a decision between the Phantom and Raoul. I think the Phantom is a half of her life, without him, she will never singing like an angel again. The last scene made me cry more than once. When the rose with black ribbon appeared on Christine's tomb, I know the love of the Phantom is perpetuated and even deeper than Raoul's. I am speechless now, I love the story so much, it is the most heart broken story in the world! Bravo! Bravo!",5,Bravo!
