286243,AHCVWPLA1O4X8,6301977203,bixodoido,"[27, 29]","James Garner stars as Jason McCullough in this hilarious Western spoof.  This was the era of John Wayne westerns, and this movie came about at just about the right time to make fun of the western and what it had become, often scarcely more than a cookie-cutter production with a predictable plot, scowling gunfighters, and the same basic storyline.  McCullough is a wandering frontiersman on his way to Australia, and happens upon a small mining town which has sprung up overnight and become too big for its laws.  He decides to earn a little extra money before moving on, and takes a job as the sheriff of the town.  Consequently he's forced to deal with the Danby bunch, a rancher family who's swindling and intimidating the mine owners.  Between dealing with the Danbys (headed by the very funny Walter Brennan), trying to keep his prisoners in a jail with no bars, and fighting off the advances of the hapless mayor's daughter, McCullough has his hands full.Garner is great in his role as the opportunistic, but effective, sheriff.  Jack Elam co-stars as his deputy, and the antics of this pair are enough to keep anyone entertained throughout the movie.

286252,ABV17UGYVAOE,6301977203,Charles de Plume,"[1, 1]","This is a clever film, even after more than one viewing.James Garner turns in his usual easy-going and likable performance. No surprise there. But the supporting cast is equally enjoyable to watch.I was impressed by the care taken with the frontier town set: clean, nicely painted signs for cafes, rooming houses, blacksmiths and other storefronts, including prices and hours; lots of of townsfolk criss-crossing the main drag--almost like a street in busy New York City; dogs running haphazardly in the background. I can believe that this is a frontier boom town, serious about doing business and eager to become a small city.Bruce Dern plays an oafish bully--son of the area's big-shot land owner--who is just witless enough to be manipulated by Sheriff Garner's three-steps-ahead ploys. I can almost find it credible that Dern's blockhead cowboy would supervise himself in the new unfinished jail house, a jail house still awaiting delivery of a steel door and bars for the windows.Walter Brennan's acting performance is so good that I was inspired to look up his biography and discovered a high degree of education, acting training and many awards over a long career. I didn't know this when I last saw him on the screen forty years ago, when I was a kid. Brennan's character is so authentic that it seems a real 19th Century rancher baron has accidentally stumbled into a movie in the process of being filmed. And even though he plays the intimidating bad guy who's going to cause you a lot of trouble, his character is not a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out. He has moments--even with James Garner--where he's confused and thoughtful about why his Son, the Moron, is languishing in a jail without bars. It would be so easy to go sour with that gag but it's really amusing.I think this film could qualify as a satire, but I never had the feeling that the filmmakers were pretentious enough to see it that way. Their goal seems to have been to deliver a wagonful of laughs and they have succeeded.",4,Fun to  Watch,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,2002,"['clever', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'one', 'viewing.James', 'Garner', 'usual', 'easy-going', 'likable', 'performance', 'surprise', 'there', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'enjoyable', 'watch.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'care', 'taken', 'frontier', 'town', 'set', 'clean', 'nicely', 'painted', 'signs', 'cafes', 'rooming', 'houses', 'blacksmiths', 'other', 'storefronts', 'including', 'prices', 'hours', 'lots', 'townsfolk', 'criss-crossing', 'main', 'drag', 'almost', 'street', 'busy', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'dogs', 'running', 'haphazardly', 'background', 'can', 'believe', 'frontier', 'boom', 'town', 'serious', 'doing', 'business', 'eager', 'become', 'small', 'city.Bruce', 'Dern', 'oafish', 'bully', 'son', 'area', 'big-shot', 'land', 'owner', 'who', 'just', 'witless', 'enough', 'be', 'manipulated', 'Sheriff', 'Garner', 'three-steps-ahead', 'ploys', 'can', 'almost', 'find', 'credible', 'Dern', 'blockhead', 'cowboy', 'would', 'supervise', 'new', 'unfinished', 'jail', 'house', 'jail', 'house', 'still', 'awaiting', 'delivery', 'steel', 'door', 'bars', 'windows.Walter', 'Brennan', 'acting', 'performance', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'inspired', 'look', 'up', 'biography', 'discovered', 'high', 'degree', 'education', 'acting', 'training', 'many', 'awards', 'long', 'career', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'last', 'saw', 'screen', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Brennan', 'character', 'so', 'authentic', 'real', '19th', 'Century', 'rancher', 'baron', 'accidentally', 'stumbled', 'movie', 'process', 'being', 'filmed', 'even', 'intimidating', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'going', 'cause', 'lot', 'trouble', 'character', 'not', 'one-dimensional', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'moments', 'even', 'James', 'Garner', 'where', 'confused', 'thoughtful', 'why', 'Son', 'Moron', 'languishing', 'jail', 'bars', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'go', 'sour', 'gag', 'really', 'amusing.I', 'think', 'film', 'could', 'qualify', 'satire', 'never', 'had', 'feeling', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'pretentious', 'enough', 'see', 'way', 'goal', 'have', 'been', 'deliver', 'wagonful', 'laughs', 'have', 'succeeded']",N/A

Playing his part almost dead straight and supported by an excellent cast, he makes Jason seem like a hero even though that's the last thing Jason wants to be.

As Jake, he's one of the reasons Support Your Local Sheriff! is as funny a Western spoof as it is. The other reasons include James Garner as Jason McCullough, Walter Brennan as Pa Danby, Joan Hackett as Prudy Perkins, Harry Morgan as Mayor Olly Perkins and Bruce Dern as Joe Danby.McCullough drifts into the raw-boned, wide-open, gold rush town of Callender, Colorado, on his way, eventually, to Australia. He winds up taking the temporary job of sheriff, one in a long line of temporary office holders. Mayor Olly Perkins, who hires him, isn't exactly forthright about the short life spans of the previous sheriffs. McCullough comes up against the Danby clan, led by the mean old reprobate Pa Danby, when he arrests young Joe Danby for murder. And while Jason is staying at the mayor's home, he happens to fall for the mayor's daughter, Prudy, a young woman who seems to fall effortlessly into disasters. Providing back protection for McCullough is his deputy, Jake, who the day before was shoveling horse manure for a living.Burt Kennedy was a longtime director of Westerns; he knows all the cliches and uses them with glee. What makes the movie work so well is the skill with which his actors do their jobs. Garner plays McCullough with laid-back cool, a wry man not to be rushed and, incidentally, very fast with a gun. Joan Hackett was a first-rate actress, and here she's not afraid to play a tomboy who always seems to put her worst foot forward. She's may fall face first in the mud but she comes up swinging. One of her best performances is in Will Penny. Walter Brennan just about steals the movie; it's a neck-and-neck tie between him and Garner. Brennan was a versatile, skilled actor who earned his three best supporting Academy Awards. He could play the home-spun preacher, the vicious outlaw, the hopping old coot. Here he's the fit-to-be-tied, rough-edged patriarch of a family of dim-witted sons. It's a nice performance. If you want to see just how good an actor Brennan was in his prime, watch him as Judge Roy Bean in The Westerner or as Old Man Clanton in My Darling Clementine. In another case of actorly theft, he effortlessly steals The Westerner from Gary Cooper. Bruce Dern as the remarkably stupid and dangerous youngest Danby adds to his list of off-center and funny portrayals.Support Your Local Sheriff! is a well-crafted, affectionate spoof of Western cliches. It works so well, in my opinion, because it doesn't take itself seriously and because of some first-rate performances by any number of solid actors. The major drawback for me is the musical score. The movie is funny enough on its own that it doesn't need to have the music grab your lapels and tell you to laugh at a scene. The score does this over and over. The DVD is bare bones and, to my eye, looks fine.",4,"An affectionate, wry Western spoof, with fine jobs by all the players",1148688000,"05 27, 2006",2006,2922,"['Jack', 'Elam', 'one', 'askew', 'eye', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'could', 'watch', 'two', 'tennis', 'matches', 'same', 'time', 'moving', 'head', 'Jake', 'one', 'reasons', 'Support', 'Local', 'Sheriff', 'funny', 'Western', 'spoof', 'other', 'reasons', 'include', 'James', 'Garner', 'Jason', 'McCullough', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Pa', 'Danby', 'Joan', 'Hackett', 'Prudy', 'Perkins', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'Mayor', 'Olly', 'Perkins', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Joe', 'Danby.McCullough', 'drifts', 'raw-boned', 'wide-open', 'gold', 'rush', 'town', 'Callender', 'Colorado', 'way', 'eventually', 'Australia', 'up', 'taking', 'temporary', 'job', 'sheriff', 'one', 'long', 'line', 'temporary', 'office', 'holders', 'Mayor', 'Olly', 'Perkins', 'who', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'forthright', 'short', 'life', 'spans', 'previous', 'sheriffs', 'McCullough', 'up', 'Danby', 'clan', 'led', 'mean', 'old', 'reprobate', 'Pa', 'Danby', 'when', 'young', 'Joe', 'Danby', 'murder', 'Jason', 'staying', 'mayor', 'home', 'fall', 'mayor', 'daughter', 'Prudy', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'fall', 'effortlessly', 'disasters', 'Providing', 'back', 'protection', 'McCullough', 'deputy', 'Jake', 'who', 'day', 'was', 'shoveling', 'horse', 'manure', 'living.Burt', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'longtime', 'director', 'Westerns', 'cliches', 'glee', 'What', 'movie', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'skill', 'actors', 'do', 'jobs', 'Garner', 'McCullough', 'laid-back', 'cool', 'wry', 'man', 'not', 'be', 'rushed', 'incidentally', 'very', 'fast', 'gun', 'Joan', 'Hackett', 'was', 'first-rate', 'actress', 'here', 'not', 'afraid', 'play', 'tomboy', 'who', 'always', 'put', 'worst', 'foot', 'forward', 'may', 'fall', 'face', 'first', 'mud', 'up', 'swinging', 'One', 'best', 'performances', 'Will', 'Penny', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'just', 'steals', 'movie', 'neck-and-neck', 'tie', 'Garner', 'Brennan', 'was', 'versatile', 'skilled', 'actor', 'who', 'earned', 'three', 'best', 'supporting', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'could', 'play', 'home-spun', 'preacher', 'vicious', 'outlaw', 'hopping', 'old', 'coot', 'Here', 'fit-to-be-tied', 'rough-edged', 'patriarch', 'family', 'dim-witted', 'sons', 'nice', 'performance', 'want', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'actor', 'Brennan', 'was', 'prime', 'watch', 'Judge', 'Roy', 'Bean', 'Westerner', 'Old', 'Man', 'Clanton', 'My', 'Darling', 'Clementine', 'case', 'actorly', 'theft', 'effortlessly', 'Westerner', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'remarkably', 'stupid', 'dangerous', 'youngest', 'Danby', 'list', 'off-center', 'funny', 'portrayals.Support', 'Local', 'Sheriff', 'well-crafted', 'affectionate', 'spoof', 'Western', 'cliches', 'so', 'well', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'first-rate', 'performances', 'number', 'solid', 'actors', 'major', 'drawback', 'musical', 'score', 'movie', 'funny', 'enough', 'own', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'music', 'grab', 'lapels', 'tell', 'laugh', 'scene', 'score', 'over', 'over', 'DVD', 'bare', 'bones', 'eye', 'fine']",N/A

286256,AUHG8KSHI529U,6301977203,Craig Matteson,"[0, 0]","This superb light-comedy-action-Western is a perfect vehicle for the kind of role James Garner did better than anyone else; the handsome, slightly dangerous (to bad guys), rascal who never gets too attached to anything.  However, he is often captured by the leading lady at the end of the film after putting up mild resistance along the way.In this film, Garner plays Jason McCullough, a stranger drawn to a gold rush town.  Ostensibly he is on his way to Australia (he has been on his way there for years).  However, the boom has caused prices to rise, so he needs an income while he tries to find a stake to claim.  The town is so tough and dangerous that they haven't been able to keep a sheriff.  McCullough takes the job and sets out to clean up the town.The one dangerous part of the town is the Danby clan.  One son, Joe (Bruce Dern), killed a man in the local bar and when McCullough gets the job he sets about arresting Joe.  One local who helps him, Jake (Jack Elam), gets deputized mostly against his will.  Joe is put in the local jail, but the cell bars have not yet arrived.  This leads to a few of the more delightful scenes in the film.Pa Danby (Walter Brennan) owns a huge block of land that also controls the only road in and out of the town.  He has gotten rich by charging the miners a 20% royalty to travel over his land.  He and his three sons have pretty much done as they pleased and have everyone terrified.  McCullough confuses them because he won't scare.  Again, more funny stuff follows.Mayor Olly Perkins is played by the redoubtable Harry Morgan and it is his daughter, Prudy (Joan Hackett), who is instantly attracted to McCullough (and he to her).  However, she is quite eccentric (and the richest woman in the territory) and this leads to other comedic opportunities.The energy of the film is high, it still holds together after more than 35 years, and Garner is as charming as he as ever been on screen.Excellent comedy that is family safe.",5,An excellent action - light comedy Western,1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,1975,"['superb', 'light-comedy-action-Western', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'kind', 'role', 'James', 'Garner', 'did', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'handsome', 'slightly', 'dangerous', 'bad', 'guys', 'rascal', 'who', 'never', 'too', 'attached', 'anything', 'However', 'often', 'captured', 'leading', 'lady', 'end', 'film', 'putting', 'up', 'mild', 'resistance', 'way.In', 'film', 'Garner', 'Jason', 'McCullough', 'stranger', 'drawn', 'gold', 'rush', 'town', 'Ostensibly', 'way', 'Australia', 'been', 'way', 'years', 'However', 'boom', 'caused', 'prices', 'rise', 'income', 'find', 'stake', 'claim', 'town', 'so', 'tough', 'dangerous', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'sheriff', 'McCullough', 'job', 'out', 'clean', 'up', 'town.The', 'one', 'dangerous', 'part', 'town', 'Danby', 'clan', 'One', 'son', 'Joe', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'killed', 'man', 'local', 'bar', 'when', 'McCullough', 'job', 'arresting', 'Joe', 'One', 'local', 'who', 'Jake', 'Jack', 'Elam', 'deputized', 'mostly', 'will', 'Joe', 'put', 'local', 'jail', 'cell', 'bars', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'arrived', 'few', 'more', 'delightful', 'scenes', 'film.Pa', 'Danby', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'huge', 'block', 'land', 'also', 'only', 'road', 'town', 'gotten', 'rich', 'charging', 'miners', '20', '%', 'royalty', 'travel', 'land', 'three', 'sons', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'done', 'pleased', 'have', 'everyone', 'terrified', 'McCullough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'scare', 'Again', 'more', 'funny', 'stuff', 'follows.Mayor', 'Olly', 'Perkins', 'played', 'redoubtable', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'daughter', 'Prudy', 'Joan', 'Hackett', 'who', 'instantly', 'attracted', 'McCullough', 'However', 'quite', 'eccentric', 'richest', 'woman', 'territory', 'other', 'comedic', 'energy', 'film', 'high', 'still', 'together', 'more', '35', 'years', 'Garner', 'as', 'charming', 'ever', 'been', 'screen.Excellent', 'comedy', 'family', 'safe']",N/A

I have not researched this individual.  I don't know if he wrote any other movies.  I do know that he wrote one of my favorite movies of all time.

Compare his portrayal as the lovable and stupid Joe Danby, with his portrayal of the crumb that shot the Duke in ""The Cowboys.""This truly is one movie that tickles my funny bone.

286268,A276M3NSIY9B82,6301977203,Harry Brewer,"[0, 0]","I'm not going to tag this movie as essential but, in my book, it is. This is James Garner in his two best genres: comedy & western. In some ways, by virtue of this being a comedy-western, it makes this a throwback, of sorts, to his old TV series, Maverick. Nobody, & I mean NOBODY, did the comedy-western genre better than Garner. His comedic timing is impeccable & his acting extremely natural. Garner is so good on so many levels it makes one wonder: Is he acting or just being himself? This is the first of the ""Support..."" films, the other being Support Your Local Gunfighter; they are similar movies but not related to each other, especially not in the sense of a sequel. But they're certainly companions to one another.Jason McCullough (James Garner) arrives in Calendar, broke. He's on his way to Australia & that's all he really wants to do. Calendar has become a gold-rush town & is booming, inflation has skyrocketed. He sees an ad for town sheriff & applies for it & is successful in securing the position but with one stipulation: He also wants to prospect for gold in order to get enough money to purchase a ticket to Australia. The town council is all too willing because McCullough puts on a shooting demonstration (shooting a coin dead center after being tossed in the air & then repeating it with a piece of paper stuck on the coin) that would impress the best shootists of the day.One of the first things to happen after he gets on the job is he witnesses Joe Danby (Bruce Dern) murder a man in a gunfight. In the process of arresting Joe Danby McCullough becomes outnumbered & gets assistance from the town drunk, Jake (Jack Elam), who is pretty decent with a handgun. This role for Elam would be one of the best of his career. Jake is made deputy by McCullough which becomes a focal point for some of the comedy.The arrest of Joe Danby is the catalyst for the film. Joe is a member of the large Danby clan that basically run the area. Pa Danby (Walter Brennan) is head of the clan & is downright nasty but hilarious. He's stuck with two more sons who aren't very bright: Luke (Dick Peabody) & Tom (Gene Evans). One of the funniest scenes in the movie occurs when Pa visits Joe in jail. The jail is newly built but the bars haven't arrived yet. McCullough, upon inspecting this jail in an earlier scene, has sprinkled red paint on the floor in front of the barless cell. When he arrested Joe Danby & put him in the cell McCullough explains to him that it's the blood of a previous arrestee that attempted to escape. Pa Danby can't believe his son is dumb enough to believe this & now we know that Pa Danby has three witless sons, not just two.McCullough has taken up residence at the house of the mayor Olly Perkins (Harry Morgan) who has a very flaky daughter, Prudy (Joan Hackett). Both are great in their roles. Prudy wants to be in a relationship with McCullough but he's quick to point out he's just here long enough to get the money to get his ticket to Australia. This doesn't slow down Prudy but everything she does turns into a comical accident.We finally get to the inevitable gunfight where the Danbys come to town with their ranch hands. Here we have another classic, funny scene where, in the middle of guns blazing, McCullough stands up & announces ""Hold your fire!"" He slowly crosses the street in order to get into a better position, all the while reminding everyone to hold their fire.

Armed with a quick draw and even quicker wit, the laid-back lawman is able to recruit the town drunk as deputy, win the heart of the Mayor's rather overreacting daughter and defeat the nasty Danby clan.  SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF is one of those classic western spoofs in which the typical cliches don't exactly apply.  James Garner, who honed his ""practical attitude"" hero act in  the ""Maverick"" TV series, is wonderful as the savvy sheriff.  Jack Elam's quirky charm is put to good use as his loyal, yet reluctant, deputy.  Henry Morgan is a hoot as the not-always reliable town mayor.  Walter Brennan is appropriately cranky as the head of the Danby clan, while Bruce Dern gets laughs as his rather dim-witted son.  From the obvious sight gag of ""Madame Orr's House"" to Elam's delivery of the off-beat epilogue, this flick never skips a beat.

From the first scene in which a hilltop funeral goes south in more ways in one thanks to gold-rush fever, to the climax involving a dozen desperados and one misfired old cannon, 'Support Your Local Sheriff' is gleeful, giddy goofiness that predates 'Blazing Saddles' in the realm of Western spoofs.In this rawhide romp, James Garner portrays Jason McCullough, a lone wanderer who's just stopped into town to pick up a couple extra bucks on his way to Australia, and decides from the look of things that the town is in serious need of law and order.  Never mind the fact that the previous sheriff turned tail and ran less than an hour after taking his badge, or that the one before him got capped - McCullough quickly finds that he's got more pressing concerns to deal with: a supposedly 'escape-proof' jail that has all the latest fixings - except for bars on the cells; the nefarious if dim-witted Danby clan, with the great Walter Brennan as gruff patriarch, who make a habit of staking their own claim in this mining town outside of the law's reach even though they're none too bright about it; Jake, the slovenly, crazy-eyed deputy - played by the equally-incomparable Jack Elam - whose tenure scooping out stalls and his history of ill conscience doesn't earn him a whole lot of respect; a clump of weak-kneed city councilors headed up by Harry Morgan as Mayor Perkins, who would probably prefer to hold off on having law and order, if only to further savor the fine services provided at Madame Orr's House; and last but certainly not least, the Mayor's eccentric daughter Trudy, played wonderfully by Joan Hackett, whose mining inheritance seems to have driven her a bit loopy.The film is a crackup left and right, and even the more serious and tender moments don't stray too far from laugh territory.  In a genre that includes such memorable epics as 'Blazing Saddles' and 'City Slickers', 'Support Your Local Sheriff' is right up there among the greats.",5,"""He stuck his finger in the end of your WHAT?""",1092873600,"08 19, 2004",2004,2107,"['dialogue', 'not', 'mention', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'slyly-executed', 'script', 'make', ""'Support"", 'Local', 'Sheriff', 'absolute', 'riot', 'first', 'scene', 'hilltop', 'funeral', 'south', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'thanks', 'gold-rush', 'fever', 'climax', 'involving', 'dozen', 'desperados', 'one', 'misfired', 'old', 'cannon', ""'Support"", 'Local', 'Sheriff', 'gleeful', 'giddy', 'goofiness', ""'Blazing"", 'Saddles', 'realm', 'Western', 'spoofs.In', 'rawhide', 'romp', 'James', 'Garner', 'Jason', 'McCullough', 'lone', 'wanderer', 'who', 'just', 'stopped', 'town', 'pick', 'up', 'couple', 'extra', 'bucks', 'way', 'Australia', 'decides', 'look', 'things', 'town', 'serious', 'need', 'law', 'order', 'mind', 'fact', 'previous', 'sheriff', 'turned', 'tail', 'ran', 'less', 'hour', 'taking', 'badge', 'one', 'got', 'capped', 'McCullough', 'quickly', 'got', 'more', 'pressing', 'concerns', 'deal', 'supposedly', ""'escape-proof"", 'jail', 'latest', 'fixings', 'bars', 'cells', 'nefarious', 'dim-witted', 'Danby', 'clan', 'great', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'gruff', 'patriarch', 'who', 'make', 'habit', 'staking', 'own', 'claim', 'mining', 'town', 'law', 'reach', 'even', ""'re"", 'none', 'too', 'bright', 'Jake', 'slovenly', 'crazy-eyed', 'deputy', 'played', 'equally-incomparable', 'Jack', 'Elam', 'tenure', 'scooping', 'out', 'stalls', 'history', 'ill', 'conscience', ""n't"", 'earn', 'whole', 'lot', 'respect', 'clump', 'weak-kneed', 'city', 'councilors', 'headed', 'up', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'Mayor', 'Perkins', 'who', 'would', 'probably', 'prefer', 'hold', 'off', 'having', 'law', 'order', 'only', 'further', 'savor', 'fine', 'services', 'provided', 'Madame', 'Orr', 'House', 'last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'Mayor', 'eccentric', 'daughter', 'Trudy', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Joan', 'Hackett', 'mining', 'inheritance', 'have', 'driven', 'bit', 'loopy.The', 'film', 'crackup', 'left', 'right', 'even', 'more', 'serious', 'tender', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'laugh', 'territory', 'genre', 'such', 'memorable', 'epics', ""'Blazing"", 'Saddles', ""'City"", 'Slickers', ""'Support"", 'Local', 'Sheriff', 'right', 'there', 'greats']",N/A

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.The frontier town of Calendar, Colorado was created because of the gold fever and a handful of lucky diggers became also the first notables - and that includes the Mayor Olly Perkins(Harry Morgan). However the city is not really a happy place, as it has to pay tribute to the Danby bandit family - also, the gold fever attracted all kind of scum and rabble and everyday sombeody is killed in a gunfight... Things became so bad that nobody wants to become the sheriff as it is considered a suicide... Then, one day a mysterious stranger (James Garner) rides into town and naively (at least everybody thinks is initially) accepts Mayor's offer to be the new sheriff and pacify the town...The story of lawless town and a heroic sheriff who tames the local troublemakers and restablishes peace and order is of course one of the most common and most beloved clich&eacute;s in the whole western genre and here it is shown almost exactly as in any other serious western - it's just that in fact EVERY SINGLE scene, under a semblance of seriousness, is a PURE PARODY, full of outlandishly funny dialogs...)))There is also some more slapstick, burlesque moments but they are few - just what it takes to spice up a little the whole thing but definitely not enough to spoil it. Those slapstick moments usually include Mayor's daughter Prudence Perkins (Joan Hackett), a still relatively young and not half bad looking spinster who combines bad character, sharp tongue and short temper with an INCREDIBLE clumsiness - she is in fact so accident prone that it is a miracle that she is still alive and has all the limbs in place...)))There is a reall gallery of odd but attaching characters in this film, like Mayor Ollie Perkins (Harry Morgan), cross-eyed butt ugly deputy sheriff Jake (Jack Elam), Joe Danby, the deadliest moron and the stupidest killer in the Wild West (Bruce Dern, grandiose in his first comic role ever), Pa Danby, the wicked patriarch of the local bandit family (Walter Brennan), and also the solidly pragmatic Bartender (Dick Haynes) and finally, last but not least, the promiscuitous Civic Leaders...)))Now, this film is of course not some kind of masterpiece but in its own category - lighthearted, entertaining, merry, cheerful comedies - it is one of the best things on the market. A guaranteed remedy against depression and other lower-pressure moments, which I liked a lot when I saw it ages ago on TV and which I re-discovered with the greatest pleasure recently.

SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF spoofs Westerns with such gentle affection it's difficult to dislike as well.James Garner plays Jason McCullough, a dead-eye quick draw expert who's passing through the gold boom town of Calendar on his way to Australia.  The lawless town needs a sheriff, and McCullough needs a grubstake, and, well.... Whys don't really matter a lot in movies like this.  All that matters is that Garner plays a variation on his Bret Maverick character, surrounds himself with an excellent supporting cast, and everyone seems to be having a good time.  Even the young Bruce Dern, who Garner arrests early in the movie, is more endearing than sinister. Walter Brennan, playing the gnarled old patriarch (he and his lawless brood own the town) and father of the jailed Dern, is delightful as he battles both Garner and the dim-wittedness of his three sons.With his genial manner and chiseled-chin good looks Garner fared better on television than the big screen.  Although physically imposing, it's hard to imagine him playing a bigger than life character.  He was always better at poking holes in inflated cliches than enacting them.  For instance, there's a scene where reluctant deputy Jack Elam is building a dreadful portrait of Pa Danby (Brennan) and the horrible things he'll do to free his son.  In the middle of his speech Garner says ""I think he's lonely.""  It's such a disarming thing to say that we can never accept Brennan as a serious threat afterwards.  In another scene, tired of shooting down all the hired guns Brennan sends against him, Garner chases the last one away by throwing rocks at him.SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF is too affectionate to be a satire and too generic to be a parody.  Its closest ancestor is probably HIGH NOON, although similarities dissolve after you get past the embattled sheriff theme.
