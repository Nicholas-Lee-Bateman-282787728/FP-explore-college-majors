Duvall is quite good, and Douglas is excellent (he CAN act!) -- the idea and its execution are pretty interesting as well. There  are some quality scenes and moments, even a splash of genuine emotion here  and there, but it gets a little carried away at points (like in the silly  &quot;rocket launcher&quot; sequence) and at such points finds itself  dangerously skirting the line between unique drama and  pseudo-&quot;socially-minded&quot; fluff. It is not a bad movie, and worth  seeing, but ultimately it suffers from the obvious detracting factor --  Joel Schumacher's involvement.

But he didn't see that societies can change, and that if you don't keep learning new job skills, you can get fired.  You can become obsolete at your job if you don't learn new jobs skills.You also can lose your mind by not learning to adapt to a changing society.The hero doesn't learn to handle his anger about people in a good way, and he doesn't learn to handle his anger about his job, or his other angers, in constructive ways.He probably needed to keep evolving his job skills to keep his job irreplaceable. And he probably needed to learn a way to correctly vent his angers in good ways, like joining a rock band + yelling out his anger, or getting into a story writing club + writing out his overwhelming anger.Instead, held in his angers too long...until he cracked...and then he took his anger out on innocent people, with his pistols and shotgun.The hero needed to learn not to do what the heroes in his fictional war films do, you can't say to yourself: I get pushed around too much, so I must overreact and lash out in anger and violence.The hero, and societies like him, need to learn how to cope with every day angers, or even bigger angers, and not use violence as the last ditch way to release unhappiness and anger.",4,The Hero Takes The Wrong Path.,1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,1607,"['like', 'film', 'think', 'writer', 'trying', 'give', 'one', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'hide', 'build', 'up', 'disappointments', 'make', 'crack', 'get', 'violent.The', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'followed', 'rules', 'people', 'gave', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'straight-laced', 'society', 'would', 'let', 'down', 'straight-laced', 'behavior', 'would', 'let', 'down', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'societies', 'can', 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'learning', 'new', 'job', 'skills', 'can', 'get', 'fired', 'can', 'become', 'obsolete', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'new', 'jobs', 'skills.You', 'also', 'can', 'lose', 'mind', 'not', 'learning', 'adapt', 'changing', 'society.The', 'hero', ""n't"", 'learn', 'handle', 'anger', 'people', 'good', 'way', ""n't"", 'learn', 'handle', 'anger', 'job', 'other', 'angers', 'constructive', 'ways.He', 'probably', 'needed', 'keep', 'evolving', 'job', 'skills', 'keep', 'job', 'irreplaceable', 'probably', 'needed', 'learn', 'way', 'correctly', 'vent', 'angers', 'good', 'ways', 'joining', 'rock', 'band', '+', 'yelling', 'out', 'anger', 'getting', 'story', 'writing', 'club', '+', 'writing', 'out', 'overwhelming', 'anger.Instead', 'held', 'angers', 'too', 'long', 'cracked', 'then', 'took', 'anger', 'out', 'innocent', 'people', 'pistols', 'shotgun.The', 'hero', 'needed', 'learn', 'not', 'do', 'what', 'heroes', 'fictional', 'war', 'films', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'get', 'pushed', 'too', 'much', 'must', 'overreact', 'lash', 'out', 'anger', 'violence.The', 'hero', 'societies', 'need', 'learn', 'how', 'cope', 'day', 'angers', 'even', 'bigger', 'angers', 'not', 'use', 'violence', 'last', 'ditch', 'way', 'release', 'unhappiness', 'anger']",N/A

Occasionally, the very colorful scenes are sharper than the rest of the scenes, but the majority of the scenes are just a bit soft-focus (and with bland coloration).  It's sharp enough, but I've seen sharper blu-rays for this time period.The bit-rate is truly odd: often as low as 9-11 Mbps, sometimes going up into the teens and low twenties, but averaging down around 12-14 Mbps.  Quite a low average for a blu-ray, and shockingly low at times, plus having a severe difference between its extreme lows and highs.I am surprised that the two major blu-ray review sites give this a review for the picture quality of 3 1/2 stars or, basically, ""good,"" and then describe it similarly.  And say how it's from a totally revamped master that makes it superior to prior releases, as if that, alone, makes it a solid picture.  In my view, it's slightly below that.Maybe this is the best this movie can look, but it's not among the better 1992/93-era blu-rays.I'm sorry to say it, as I enjoy the film.  But it's definitely not bad; it's just not an amazing BR experience!Separately, there is little in the way of extras: there is a commentary track, and there is a short, 11-minute piece with Michael Douglas on filming the movie and on his view of his character, which would have been nicer if it had been longer.

110603,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,0790742780,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 2]","Twelve years before the Oscar-winning CRASH (2005) came this underappreciated vehicle about a Southern Californian who just had too much.**SPOILERS** Michael Douglas, playing down the middle of what could have been a very unsympathetic role, portrays one of society's victims: an unemployed defense worker still with a short-sleeve, button-down shirt, crewcut, ""nerd (pocket) pack"" and old-fashioned briefcase.  In short, a middle-aged white male heading for obsolescence -- until his day takes some very surprising turns.  He first abandons his car on the freeway during an interminable delay but cannot walk directly home because of Metrorail construction.  Taking a roundabout route, he crosses paths with multiple unsavory types, especially an obnoxious Asian grocery-store owner and two Latino gang members. He also needs regular access to a pay telephone (it would not have been in character for him to have a cell phone in 1993) as he tries to beg his ex-wife for a little face time with his little girl on her birthday.**MORE SPOILERS**Shockingly, Douglas' character, while originally flummoxed by all this diversity, learns to meet these challenges but on the way becomes a full-fledged urban territorist.** (The similarity to CRASH is most apparent when violence pops up from almost nowhere.)FALLING DOWN could easily have turned formulaic but happily, it transcends its material (Robert Duvall cast as a cop on his last day before retiring).  As well as a good taut script, the movie achieves its excellence in no small part because of his supporting cast, not only the  aforesaid Robert Duvall but also Tuesday Weld, Barbara Hershey, Rachel Ticotin, and Lois Smith.Politics?  Well, as in CRASH, there are very few verities in FALLING DOWN.  I certainly do not consider it an endorsement of urban terrorism or a delve into ethnic stereotypes.

110604,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,0790742780,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I've always found this to be an intriguing movie, and though it is no deep and profound commentary on our culture and behaviors, it does, nonetheless, touch on an issue of real importance in our society: the issue of social interaction  between strangers, and how it can go horribly wrong.  Bill Foster, the main character, is clearly presented in this movie as the bad guy.  He's emotionally unstable, demonstrably capable of extreme violence, and judging by his relationships with his ex-wife and his mother, not completely in touch with reality.  Nevertheless, as so many other reviewers here have noted, despite the fact of his bad guy status, one can't help but feel sympathetic with him.  There's really no mystery to this; we've all been faced with rude store clerks, snotty fast food cashiers, supercilious rich people, and so forth.  Some of us have even been face to face with violent, dangerous punks.  And probably all of us have fantasized about punching the smug, sneering face of the arrogant jerk in front of us in such situations.  Bill Foster is a sympathetic character because even though he overreacts violently (although I wouldn't call his response to the gang thugs, or the neo-nazi overreaction, as his life was truly threatened in those cases), in each case he IS genuinely provoked.  Not one of the strangers he confronts thoughout the course of the movie would have had anything to fear from him if they had simply treated him courteously and respectfully.This movie ought to be taken as just as much a warning about the potential consequences of certain behavior (in this case, rudeness) as another of Michael Douglas' movies, ""Fatal Attraction"" was about adultery.  It's never a bad idea to treat others with the same respect and courtesy you would want for yourself.  You never know what the person in front of you at any given moment is going through, or what that person may be capable of.  And although this is a movie, a work of fiction, we've all read about violent road rage encounters, and other incidents arising from seemingly the most trivial provocation.  Just the other day I read about someone shooting someone in line at a convenience store because the person ahead of him was taking too long to make a purchase, and responded rudely when urged to speed things up.  Don't go around being rude to people.  The stranger you snap peevishly at may just become angry enough to knock your block off.  And quite aside from fear of what others might do if you irritate them, being polite is simply the right thing to do.  And it costs you nothing, so why not just be polite to people?In this movie, Bill Foster throws off the restraint most of use every day when faced with such provocations and irritations, and soon finds himself the object of a manhunt by the police.  Even though he self-destructs in the end, and even though we are presented (in the form of Detective Prendergast) with a character who manages to cope with just as much stress and bad human behavior as Foster, we still feel a twinge of sympathy for Foster, right to the very end.",3,An interesting movie with a protagonist we can identify with.,1192838400,"10 20, 2007",2007,3087,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'be', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'deep', 'profound', 'commentary', 'culture', 'behaviors', 'nonetheless', 'touch', 'issue', 'real', 'importance', 'society', 'issue', 'social', 'interaction', 'strangers', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Bill', 'Foster', 'main', 'character', 'clearly', 'presented', 'movie', 'bad', 'guy', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'demonstrably', 'capable', 'extreme', 'violence', 'judging', 'relationships', 'ex-wife', 'mother', 'not', 'completely', 'touch', 'reality', 'Nevertheless', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'noted', 'fact', 'bad', 'guy', 'status', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'really', 'mystery', ""'ve"", 'been', 'faced', 'rude', 'store', 'clerks', 'snotty', 'fast', 'food', 'cashiers', 'supercilious', 'rich', 'people', 'so', 'forth', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'face', 'face', 'violent', 'dangerous', 'punks', 'probably', 'have', 'fantasized', 'punching', 'smug', 'sneering', 'face', 'arrogant', 'jerk', 'front', 'such', 'situations', 'Bill', 'Foster', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'even', 'violently', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'response', 'gang', 'thugs', 'neo-nazi', 'overreaction', 'life', 'was', 'truly', 'threatened', 'cases', 'case', 'genuinely', 'provoked', 'Not', 'one', 'strangers', 'course', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'anything', 'fear', 'had', 'simply', 'treated', 'courteously', 'respectfully.This', 'movie', 'ought', 'be', 'taken', 'as', 'just', 'much', 'warning', 'potential', 'consequences', 'certain', 'behavior', 'case', 'rudeness', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'movies', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'was', 'adultery', 'never', 'bad', 'idea', 'treat', 'others', 'same', 'respect', 'courtesy', 'would', 'want', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'person', 'front', 'given', 'moment', 'going', 'what', 'person', 'may', 'be', 'capable', 'movie', 'work', 'fiction', ""'ve"", 'read', 'violent', 'road', 'rage', 'encounters', 'other', 'incidents', 'arising', 'seemingly', 'most', 'trivial', 'provocation', 'Just', 'other', 'day', 'read', 'someone', 'shooting', 'someone', 'line', 'convenience', 'store', 'person', 'ahead', 'was', 'taking', 'too', 'long', 'make', 'purchase', 'responded', 'rudely', 'when', 'urged', 'speed', 'things', 'up', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'around', 'being', 'rude', 'people', 'stranger', 'snap', 'peevishly', 'may', 'just', 'become', 'angry', 'enough', 'knock', 'block', 'quite', 'aside', 'fear', 'what', 'others', 'might', 'do', 'irritate', 'being', 'polite', 'simply', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'nothing', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'polite', 'people', 'movie', 'Bill', 'Foster', 'restraint', 'most', 'use', 'day', 'when', 'faced', 'such', 'provocations', 'irritations', 'soon', 'object', 'manhunt', 'police', 'Even', 'end', 'even', 'are', 'presented', 'form', 'Detective', 'Prendergast', 'character', 'who', 'cope', 'just', 'much', 'stress', 'bad', 'human', 'behavior', 'Foster', 'still', 'feel', 'twinge', 'sympathy', 'Foster', 'right', 'very', 'end']",N/A
110605,A1GF9THOHXXP9V,0790742780,Amazon Feedback Person,"[2, 7]","I give this DVD a failing grade, not because of the theatrical movie itself. Hell's no ! The movie was excellent !!! I am giving a bad rating because of the DVD format of this Deluxe Edition alone & that this DVD is presented in a centered rectangular mannered widescreen formatted version of this movie being extremely discriminative towards classic full screen box screen TV's like mine. Yeah, I have a box screen Tv still. So what. it still works perfectly. If it ain't broke, don't replace it. Right ? My box screen Tv works fine.Anyways, there is nothing Deluxe about this movie at all other than the expected usual documentary of how the movie is made, which usually comes standard on most, if not the majority of un-Deluxe versioned movies on DVD as a whole.I have been more successfully happy with the other DVD for which the DVD cover shows Michael Douglas standing on a small few feet tall brick wall of sorts with a baseball bat in one hand & a briefcase in the other hand with tall buildings in the background behind him while he stands on a few step perch. The original released DVD format. That is the one & only version you & everyone would be more happy with. This Deluxe Edition only offers a scrunched up smaller size film with dark bars on the top & bottom of the screen with the film in the center of the Tv screen. For widescreen owners, this movie might be a great fit, but for box screen Tv owners like myself, this here Deluxe Edition of this movie is not worth the money. The movie, again, is excellent, but I would ask everyone to invest in the other released DVD that offers both Widescreen & reverse side Full Screen formats. What I do is I turn over the disc once purchased & I put a CD / DVD label on the Full Screen side of the disc for easier handling & where I can print out the name of the movie title & paste the label on the DVD itself manually. That solves my dislike for the bias discriminative widescreen format that only tailors itself to widescreen Tv's for which I do not own. Again, 5 stars for the movie, but it never asked about how I liked the movie. It asked me ""How I rated this item"" not how I rate this movie popularity-wise. Which refers to the DVD itself & with the DVD they are referring to the presented format & any & all contents of this physical DVD as a whole. The format stinks in my opinion only because I don't own & cannot afford a widescreen Tv & my box Tv works just fine still, but the movie is great if you would just buy & invest into the other first initial DVD release of this movie.

A good subtitle to this movie could have been &quot;Good Guys Finish Last&quot; as we follow the spiral of ultimate self destruction Michael Douglas embarks on to it's climatic, if reasonably predictable conclusion. The plot is quite simple, a middle class hard working, respectable man with no hint of a criminal past, or even propensity for violent or abnormal behavour is gradually pushed, up to and over the edge of his personal tolerance level. What results is him crashing down on the other side, and taking casualties with him as he &quot;falls down&quot;. I find it inconceivable to think that most of us will not be able to relate to at least some of the burdens that befall him, and this is the real power of the film. After losing his job (due to policy and cutbacks), an acrimonous divorce, and a general crummy hand he has been dealt he begins to act upon every tiny thing that has and does frustrates him (as many things frustrate us all) as he journeys through the movie, with devastating results. I don't know if there is a message in the film, but it is certainly compelling, and often gripping. Robert Duvall puts in a terrific performance as a veteran cop with one day to retirement who begins to piece together the unlikely string of events, in a powerful subplot which runs in tandem with the exploits of Douglas, until the two cross paths toward the end of the picture. Gritty, often graphic, and very powerful - this movie will live with you a long time after you have viewed it, for many reasons (most I which I don't have time to list here).

Having already gone through a divorce with his wife and just recently laid off from his job in the defense industry, D-Fens finds himself stuck in a traffic jam in Los Angeles in sweltering heat and a non-functional air conditioner. Exasperated with the non-progress of the traffic, he simply abandons his car and begins a journey across Los Angeles with the goal of ""going home."" Along the way, he sees reason after reason to be disgusted with the society he encounters and leaves a trail of crimes and destruction in his path. Meanwhile, Officer Prendergast (Robert Duvall), a police officer at the LAPD, is on the last day of work before a premature retirement. He copes with his own perceived spinelessness while trying to solve the crime spree in L.A.At its core, the D-Fens character is the story of the average man in an average world. Before the events of the movie, he was married, had a kid, and had a decent job. It was the embodiment of an average life and D-Fens thought he had it all. However, this all came crashing down. His wife divorces him. After the end of the Cold War, budget cutbacks cause him to lose his job in the defense industry. He was proud to have worked in a position designing missiles to protect his country, but ultimately becomes disgusted and enraged at the society he defended. He was a man that played by the rules his whole life. He worked hard and did not smoke or drink, but cracks under the pressure of reality and the ultimate unfairness of life.Michael Douglas stars as the main character in the film and gives a truly outstanding performance. The story and the dialogue, for the most part, is really good. There are some clich&eacute;d aspects, such as the cop who just so happens to be one day from retirement.Overall, this is an enjoyable movie with a great performance by its lead.",4,"""I'm the bad guy?

You know the rest of the story...""Falling Down"" is a near-conservative, half-sexist and very violent movie about an angry White man, named D-Fence, who gets sick and tired of the car lines in LA, and decides to walk through the city instead. Along the way, he confronts stingy Koreans, Hispanic gangsters, a neo-Nazi shop owner and some rich White golfers. The encounters get progressively more violent, as D-Fence gets hold of more and more lethal weapons. Finally, the police is called in and tracks him down.

This story parallels Douglas, who was sacked from his previous job building missles to defend a country he once believed in, with L.A. Police Investigator Duvall (as always, a real treat). Duvall's wife (Tuesday Weld) is planning his retirement after losing their young girl to S.I.D.S. Douglas, on the other hand, is initially trying to keep a cool head, looking for work and wants to visit divorced wife (Barbara Hershey) for their little girl's birthday. Hershey in no way wants to see Douglas - a man she claims formerly verbally abused her - presumably from everyday job stress. Tension build-up from an early morning traffic jam drives innocent Douglas to walk the streets of L.A. to his girl's birthday, in which he encounters events and people that would drive even Fred Rogers insane. Dreary, and way too cyncical portrait of &quot;everyday life&quot; combined with weak transitions between two undeveloped characters will confuse most viewers of the connection that Duvall and Douglas share. Yet, Douglas's confrontations with L.A. slimb and grimb yield classic, unforgettable moments. A must-see for Douglas fans.

Great film about a normal guy who snaps.I'm not going to waste my time talking about the movie it's a must see.  What I am here to talk about is the great Blu ray that Warner Brothers has put out.Lets talk about the package first, it's not a typical plastic case but a hardcover book.  It's about the same thickness as a BR case but a tad bigger.  The pages vary in content from pre to post production.  You also get some very nice full color pictures.The Blu-ray disc; The transfer is great.  I was really surprised when I put the movie in, very clear transfer with very little grain.The sound is where things get a bit disappointing, only a 2.0 track is available.  It still sounds good, but definitely could benefit from a 5.1 option.The extras are meek, but this time around it's quality and not quantity.  First of all you get two seperate commentaries with the director Schumacher and star Douglas.  There's a 10 minute featurette called ""A Discussion with Michael Douglas"" where the actor recants on his experiences with making the film.  Rounding out the disc is the theatrical trailer.This disc comes highly recommended.

The disgust and utter contempt one feels for the injustices occurring everywhere.  This movie is 10 years old but has just as much meaning in the new Millennia as it did in the 90's.  It's about an average man, Bill Foster played by Michael Douglas, on the verge of cracking.  He's lost his wife to a divorce, lost custody of his daughter, and lost his job.  It takes the painful LA traffic and a broken air conditioner in his car to push him over the edge.  Thus starts his journey.  This movie is his story and his trek through LA to get back home.  It's about his abhorrence of everything wrong and he's not afraid to make it known.  This movie seems to convey the thoughts of many people in the US and it helps one empathize with his character.  You can't help routing for this guy.  He's just trying to make it home and bad things keep happening.  They get progressively worse and he gets progressively more violent.  Some of the things he does will make you want to cheer.  But in the grand scheme of things you feel sad for him.This movie is unique in the fact that there's not a true protagonist and a true antagonist.  Robert Duvall plays a cop, Prendergast, who is very similar to Michael Douglas' character.  He too is plagued by problems and he's such a warm character in the movie that one can't help but feel sorry for him.  His wife is having a nervous breakdown, and his only daughter passed away.  He has a desk job now because his wife wanted him off the streets and he's at his last day at work because he's retiring.  The other cops at the precinct, with exception to his partner, all give him a hard time.  During his last day he gets reports of incidences that he thinks are caused by the same person.  These incidences are in fact caused by Michael Douglas' character...And Robert Duvall wants to stop him.So it becomes good guy vs. not so bad guy.  A cop vs. a self-made vigilante.  Who do you route for??  This is a sad movie that depicts what might happen if a regular Joe Schmoe were to snap.The story, combined with great performances and an awesome, and I do mean awesome, musical score, makes this movie well worth seeing!  It's a very powerful movie that is funny at times and sad at others.  Anyone who's ever been angry at something will enjoy this movie.  Oh... if you're not sane please don't watch this movie.

I decided to write a review of it even though it's twelve years old because it's a movie that is still relevant and better than any movie I've seen in the last several years.  This movie portrays, in all its stark detail, the modern man's dilemma.  In a sense, Douglas' character ""Bill"" is a modern day Holden Caulfield, Willy Loman, and Meursault (from THE STRANGER) all rolled into one.  The writers of this script give us a real person behind the headline ""Man brandishes gun in McDonalds"" (or any similar headline).  The genius behind this character and Douglas' portrayal of him is that the audience can actually feel sympathy AND empathy for him.  The frustrations that Bill experiences are ones that all of us have been through:  robot-like ""rule-enforcers"" (e.g., at 11:33 a.m. ""Sorry, sir, but we stopped serving breakfast at 11:30""), greedy people (e.g., you have to buy an .85 soda to get change to use the pay phone), haters (e.g., the Neo-Nazi nutcase thrift store owner), the traffic jams, criminals who rome the streets freely able to harass othes, etc., etc., etc.  This is what makes Bill's, ""So, I'm the bad guy?"" at the end so poignant.This movie is also great for the contrasts it sets up.  Duvall's character, the police detective Prendergast, is a foil for Bill. He has also lost his daughter (she died), has a bad marriage, and has ""existed"" in his career for years rather than enjoying it. Yet he doesn't become unhinged as Douglas does because he realizes and accepts the hypocrisy of the world, whereas Bill cannot. As Prendergrast says to Bill at the end, ""They lie to everybody.""  A contrast is also set up between Bill and the Neo-Nazi thrift store owner. It is an unfortunate habit of people to paint others with a broad brush, and the directors subtly make the point that Bill--despite becoming unhinged--is not the same type of person as the Neo-Nazi.Overall, this movie is a brutally honest commentary on modern society and on our perpetual struggle to survive in it.",5,Existential Angst in the Contemporary World,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,2088,"['just', 'saw', 'movie', 'probably', 'third', 'time', 'was', 'tube', 'last', 'week', 'decided', 'write', 'review', 'even', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'movie', 'still', 'relevant', 'better', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'movie', 'stark', 'detail', 'modern', 'man', 'dilemma', 'sense', 'Douglas', 'character', 'Bill', 'modern', 'day', 'Holden', 'Caulfield', 'Willy', 'Loman', 'Meursault', 'THE', 'STRANGER', 'rolled', 'one', 'writers', 'script', 'give', 'real', 'person', 'headline', 'Man', 'gun', 'McDonalds', 'similar', 'headline', 'genius', 'character', 'Douglas', 'portrayal', 'audience', 'can', 'actually', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'AND', 'empathy', 'frustrations', 'Bill', 'experiences', 'are', 'ones', 'have', 'been', 'robot-like', 'rule-enforcers', 'e.g.', '11:33', 'a.m.', 'Sorry', 'sir', 'stopped', 'serving', 'breakfast', '11:30', 'greedy', 'people', 'e.g.', 'have', 'buy', '.85', 'soda', 'get', 'change', 'use', 'pay', 'phone', 'haters', 'e.g.', 'Neo-Nazi', 'nutcase', 'thrift', 'store', 'owner', 'traffic', 'jams', 'criminals', 'who', 'rome', 'streets', 'freely', 'able', 'harass', 'othes', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'etc', 'what', 'Bill', 'So', ""'m"", 'bad', 'guy', 'end', 'so', 'poignant.This', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'contrasts', 'up', 'Duvall', 'character', 'police', 'detective', 'Prendergast', 'foil', 'Bill', 'also', 'lost', 'daughter', 'died', 'bad', 'marriage', 'existed', 'career', 'years', 'rather', 'enjoying', ""n't"", 'become', 'unhinged', 'Douglas', 'hypocrisy', 'world', 'whereas', 'Bill', 'can', 'not', 'Prendergrast', 'Bill', 'end', 'lie', 'everybody', 'contrast', 'also', 'set', 'up', 'Bill', 'Neo-Nazi', 'thrift', 'store', 'owner', 'unfortunate', 'habit', 'people', 'paint', 'others', 'broad', 'brush', 'directors', 'subtly', 'make', 'point', 'Bill', 'becoming', 'unhinged', 'not', 'same', 'type', 'person', 'Neo-Nazi.Overall', 'movie', 'brutally', 'honest', 'commentary', 'modern', 'society', 'perpetual', 'struggle', 'survive']",N/A

He's carved himself an interesting niche in Hollywood as the director critics love to hate. However, if the viewer will simply submit to his zany stylings from the get-go, they will be treated to some solid amusement. That being said, it seems like Falling Down is Schumacher at the best of his abilities. The screenplay is heavy handed with its denouncement of the American lifestyle, but it also offers up various memorable scenes of rebellion and a surprisingly fulfilling showdown between the film's two leads. The entire film hinges on its idea of disillusionment in the eyes of do-gooder white men, and Falling Down thankfully clicks in the end and puts things into perspective. Michael Douglas is a fantastic 'average Joe' turned lunatic and Robert Duvall embodies the end-of-the-road cop searching for more in his life.

The question of ""where do these maniacs come from?"" is a question Hollywood avoids except as the foundation for franchise-making horror films.

It also answers the question: ""These maniacs come from us"". Any of us. All of us. Surviving a series of personal and professional failures doesn't always make us stronger; many, crushed in their own way under the burden, snap.

It always leaves me feeling really, really weird because it touches on so many things we all have to put up with each day, presents a monster whom I can't help but sympathize with in some degree, provides us with a hero whose own life is rife with undeserved problems, and runs its course atop a strong undercurrent of sadness.  Michael Douglas gives one of his better performances as Bill Foster, an unremarkable man who finds his world torn apart and finally just snaps.  He has lost his wife and little girl (which is his own fault); he's lost his job, the one thing that made him feel important; he just wants things to be like they used to be.  He doesn't want to sit in traffic with no air conditioning or pay almost a dollar for a little can of soda or see plastic surgeons living the life of Riley while he can't even support his little girl.  His journey ""home"" is an extraordinary one, and the kinds of awful people he encounters on the way do nothing to help his mentality.  It's hard not to cheer him on when he manages to effect an escape from a couple of gangsters trying to rob him, but acts such as holding a burger joint up just because they refuse to serve him breakfast after lunch time is, obviously, way out there.  No matter what terrible things he does, though, I can't get completely past the fact that he earnestly wants to see his little girl and give her a present for her birthday; in a clearly psychotic way, I find this movie somewhat touching, and that only makes the whole experience more depressing than it already is.Robert Duvall is indeed quite good as the good cop, Prendergast, pursuing this vigilante on his last day before retirement.  His life is no dream either, but of course he handles his own problems in a way quite unlike our man Foster does.  His wife is clearly disturbed, made frighteningly burdensome and vulnerable by the death of their own little girl and an earlier wounding of her husband on the job.  For her benefit, he took a desk job and is forced to put up with a lot of jokes and insults from his fellow cops, including his own boss.  Except for his partner, all of the cops in this film are as unfeeling and cruel as some of the shady characters Foster meets up with during his journey home, and that is to me one of the more disturbing aspects of this film.One of the things I liked most about Falling Down was its attempt to portray Foster as one very disturbed man and not a stand-in for any type of stereotypical vigilante; one character in particular makes this point quite clearly when, discovering that Foster doesn't actually agree with him in his own twisted, stereotypically extremist mindset, he asks the man just what kind of vigilante he is supposed to be.  My own thinking is that Falling Down is not meant to be a warning about a group of potential Bill Fosters festering in the midst of society; instead, by showing us what happens to one man, it is warning us to walk carefully on our own journeys and to be careful to keep our tempers in check even when the world seems to be out to get us.  At the same time, it doesn't imply that we should roll over and play dead whenever a problem comes our way, using the character of Prendergast to show us that we can and should stand up for ourselves but only in constructive ways.  I really have a lot of conflicting emotions about this film, but the one thing I am sure of is that Falling Down is an unforgettable motion picture well worth seeing.",5,A film that really leaves its mark on you,1053648000,"05 23, 2003",2003,3771,"['powerful', 'film', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'type', 'social', 'commentary', 'condemnation', 'modern', 'society', 'certainly', 'problems', 'will', 'always', 'exist', 'human', 'beings', 'Falling', 'Down', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'potent', 'effect', 'anyone', 'watching', 'though', 'always', 'feeling', 'really', 'really', 'weird', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'day', 'monster', 'whom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'sympathize', 'degree', 'hero', 'own', 'life', 'rife', 'undeserved', 'problems', 'course', 'strong', 'undercurrent', 'sadness', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'Bill', 'Foster', 'unremarkable', 'man', 'who', 'world', 'torn', 'apart', 'finally', 'just', 'snaps', 'lost', 'wife', 'little', 'girl', 'own', 'fault', 'lost', 'job', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'feel', 'important', 'just', 'things', 'be', 'used', 'be', ""n't"", 'want', 'sit', 'traffic', 'air', 'conditioning', 'pay', 'almost', 'dollar', 'little', 'can', 'soda', 'see', 'plastic', 'surgeons', 'living', 'life', 'Riley', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'support', 'little', 'girl', 'journey', 'home', 'extraordinary', 'one', 'kinds', 'awful', 'people', 'way', 'do', 'nothing', 'help', 'mentality', 'hard', 'not', 'cheer', 'when', 'effect', 'escape', 'couple', 'gangsters', 'trying', 'rob', 'acts', 'such', 'holding', 'burger', 'joint', 'up', 'just', 'refuse', 'serve', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'time', 'obviously', 'way', 'there', 'matter', 'what', 'terrible', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'completely', 'fact', 'earnestly', 'see', 'little', 'girl', 'give', 'present', 'birthday', 'clearly', 'psychotic', 'way', 'find', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'touching', 'only', 'whole', 'experience', 'more', 'depressing', 'already', 'is.Robert', 'Duvall', 'indeed', 'quite', 'good', 'good', 'cop', 'Prendergast', 'pursuing', 'vigilante', 'last', 'day', 'retirement', 'life', 'dream', 'either', 'course', 'own', 'problems', 'way', 'quite', 'man', 'Foster', 'wife', 'clearly', 'disturbed', 'made', 'frighteningly', 'burdensome', 'vulnerable', 'death', 'own', 'little', 'girl', 'earlier', 'wounding', 'husband', 'job', 'benefit', 'took', 'desk', 'job', 'forced', 'put', 'up', 'lot', 'jokes', 'insults', 'fellow', 'cops', 'including', 'own', 'boss', 'partner', 'cops', 'film', 'are', 'unfeeling', 'cruel', 'shady', 'characters', 'Foster', 'up', 'journey', 'home', 'one', 'more', 'disturbing', 'aspects', 'film.One', 'things', 'liked', 'most', 'Falling', 'Down', 'was', 'attempt', 'portray', 'Foster', 'one', 'very', 'disturbed', 'man', 'not', 'stand-in', 'type', 'stereotypical', 'vigilante', 'one', 'character', 'particular', 'point', 'quite', 'clearly', 'when', 'discovering', 'Foster', ""n't"", 'actually', 'agree', 'own', 'twisted', 'stereotypically', 'extremist', 'mindset', 'man', 'just', 'what', 'kind', 'vigilante', 'supposed', 'be', 'own', 'thinking', 'Falling', 'Down', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'warning', 'group', 'potential', 'Bill', 'Fosters', 'festering', 'midst', 'society', 'instead', 'showing', 'what', 'one', 'man', 'warning', 'walk', 'carefully', 'own', 'journeys', 'be', 'careful', 'keep', 'tempers', 'check', 'even', 'when', 'world', 'be', 'out', 'get', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'imply', 'should', 'roll', 'over', 'play', 'dead', 'whenever', 'problem', 'way', 'using', 'character', 'Prendergast', 'show', 'can', 'should', 'stand', 'up', 'ourselves', 'only', 'constructive', 'ways', 'really', 'have', 'lot', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'am', 'sure', 'Falling', 'Down', 'unforgettable', 'motion', 'picture', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

Although the frequent acts of random violence are somewhat comical, the rest of the film is a biosphere of our &quot;American&quot; culture.  Douglas treks a path through L.A. and encounters various problems in society - sort of a modernized Greek &quot;Odyssey&quot;.  Douglas, our tragic hero, is the only character who isn't asleep . . . asleep to all the hate and injustice that is occurring in our lives.  And therefore, like any hero, is doomed to die by his convictions.Michael Douglas portrays your typical patriotic citizen who becomes &quot;obsolete&quot; in a constantly changing world.  I think perhaps all viewers can relate with this character because we all have been rubbed the wrong way by the exact same people Douglas encounters in the film.  And sometimes we'd like to flip out too.The end of the film is particularly symbolic in the climactic resolution.  There is a sense of sadness when Douglas' character is killed, but at the same time their is a liberation.  A liberation from the hell he was living . . . so perhaps the death is not sad at all. If you can't move with society, than you are doomed to fall prey to it.

The movie has a simple premise, take an ordinary man that goes through the kind of life that so many of us do nowadays (divorce, laid off), and watch as he snaps.  As the lead character Michael Douglas tries to calm himself down from the normal stresses that we all have to deal with now, he encounters more and more things blocking his path to possibly being able to reach some sense of calmness and rest.  Whether it's being mugged, overcharged, stuck in traffic, attacked, or just sickened by society in general, the lead character eventually goes down a path that he cannot turn back from as more and more is said about how we are as Americans today.

I've been catching up on movies I missed in the theatre, and ""Falling Down"" is among the best of them.Yes, it's contrived and a bit preachy, but the acting is marvelous, and Bill ""D-FENS"" Foster's adventures as he walks through 1993 Los Angeles are laden with moments where we can't help but cheer him on. The scene in the burger store is classic. Who among us hasn't wanted to strangle some officious little prick who tells us we missed the breakfast menu by three minutes?If it were possible I'd give ""Falling Down"" 4.5 stars, but that's not possible on Amazon.  It's really a very good movie, but not quite up there in the realm of greatness. While we sympathize with Foster's SITUATION, we can't really empathize with Foster himself, because he's clearly demented and becomes increasingly so as the movie progresses. Another minor flaw: many of the people Bill encounters are stereotypes (the Hispanic gangsters, the Nazi surplus store guy, the burger joint staff, etc.) and his reactions to various frustrations are often absurd.Still, it's a sharp, insightful and enjoyable flick.

110638,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,0790742780,David J. Brown,"[3, 5]","Finally, a special edition of one of the few really innovative film to come out of a studio in the 90's!  I didn't know about this film's existance until it hit cable in 1993, and I must've watched it over a dozen times back then.  I'm very pleased to have a remastered special edition DVD, even if the special features are a bit sparse for my tastes.Firstly, this is truly the most interesting character Michael Douglas has ever played.  This performance is the acting version of surgery.  It's so percise and delicate, that one wrong decision and the whole thing, the character, the story, the film's tone completely falls apart.  Douglas plays Ben Foster, though throughout the majority of the film he is simply known as D-FENS(the letters on his personalized license plate).  D-FENS is a recently laid off defense worker, end of the cold war hung a lot of the men in this profession out to dry(according to the DVD's loaded commentary track) and he just snaps one day in traffic.  He decides he is going to see his ex-wife and child and he walks across L.A. to get to them.  He walks around parts of L.A. rarely seen on film.  Parts of the city that make up the majority of it, but are glossed or glorified in past films.  On his way 'home' D-FENS runs into common annoyances that are part-and-parcel when existing in a crowded area like a city: gang members, angry Korean store owners, surly fast food clerks, and a red neck running an Army/Navy store.  Oh, and he does something I know I've always dreamed about to a construction site.  This film is rife with blackly humorous satirical jabs and outrage against what America has ultimately become what certain people like D-FENS feel about a changing society that is happy to leave them behind.An audience member fed on a healthy diet of recent films coming to this movie cold will be shocked about the un-P.C. nature of the story.  Filmed in 1992, I guess moviegoers were a lot less sensitive and could think more for themselves.  This film would never get made today by a studio, NEVER.  Douglas doesn't make excuses for his character's behavior in the film.  There's no cheesy or false moments of realizations.  He starts on a dark path and goes all the way through to the end without common movie conventions hindering the tone or reality of the story.  That's why his performance is so brilliant.  He plays a narrow minded dinosaur of a man, who acts out the worst possible aspects of a repressed outrage, but he manages to get some sympathy, and even some slight semblance of understanding from the audience.  He acts out certain blue collar fantasies.  He shows how awful they really are when being applied to reality, but never sugar coats it.  He seems real in an unreal situation. The only contrived thing about the film is the aspect of how the Douglas character manages to make it across L.A. unnoticed and without being caught within what amounts to an 8 or 10 hour day.Robert Duvall plays that age-old cinema convention of the about-to-retire cop who has elected to ride a desk job for the latter part of his career.  The weird thing is,this film makes the cop convention seem fresh, in no small degree due to Duvall's very real and welcoming performance.  It just proves that just because it's a cliche' doesn't mean it can't be original or entertaining.  He has the same blue collar life as D-FENS but he chooses a different path.  The movie alludes that his obsession with apprehending D-FENS comes from how much he relates to his plight.  In the film's climax you can sense in Duvall's performance the he doesn't want the situation to end badly.  It's a more subtle performance, but it's just as brilliant as Douglas'.The DVD itself only has two special features, a commentary track and a new interview with Michael Douglas.  I was bummed that there wasn't a retrospective doc concerning the film, but that was until I listend to the commentary track. The track has comments from director Joel Schumacher, the producers, Douglas, screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith, and even Vonde Curtis Hall(who has about a minute of screen time in the film as the 'Not Economically Viable' protester outside a bank). This extra mile is why this commentary track goes above and beyond the usual and negates the necessity of a retrospective doc. The interview with Michael Douglas is really interesting.  He gives details on how at the Falling Down point in his career he was in a slump, tired of playing reactive characters in such films as Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct.  He also thinks back to the period and the changes the country was going through politically and socially.  One of the main reasons this film even ended up studio produced was becaus Douglas(also a producer on the film) lobbied for it and its screenplay so hard.  Not something many actors would do.  A very interesting detail is in regard to how up until that point in his career he picked film projects more based on his producer's hat then his actor hat.  He went for what would make the best movie and not necessarily the best character for him to play.  Douglas is also on the commentary track and he doesn't repeat any of the info contained in the interview.Joel Schumacher is a very interesting director.  He has worked in almost every genre and succeded at most of them.  Most may know and love him from his film The Lost Boys and others may know and hate him from Batman Forever And Batman and Robin.  Please, fanboys, get over it.  Batman and Robin happened over ten years ago.  He's made many fine films since then(Tigerland, Phone Booth, Veronica Guerrin, Phantom of the Opera).  The new Batman franchise is awesome, you got your Batman back to make love to, so please get off the guy's nuts already.  If you actually think Batman And Robin is the worst film ever made then you don't watch many films, at least ones of substance.  Schumacher has always been a filmmaker who directs in darkness(which is strange that they picked him to 'lighten up' the original Batman franchise) and that's why he was perfect for this film.  He lets the narrative and satire play out without haveing scenes or characters come out to let the idiot audience know that 'this was bad' or 'you shouldn't do that'.  He leaves the judgements to the audience.  He also leaves the joys of D-FENS acting out.  Of course, D-FENS enjoyment is cut short in the grand scheme of things.After rewatching this film recently I was shocked at how much more relevant the subject matter is today.  The film is about a man left behind in a changing country.  He refuses to catch up and instead chooses to act out.  Here we are in 2009, after the Obama election, and we still have some old white dinosaurs refusing to listen to the majority of the American public and continue to spout the same old-world/1950's empy rhetoric.  It wouldn't surprise me if either Dick Cheney or Rush Limbaugh pulled a D-FENS on the freeway somewhere any day.See this movie and listen to the commentary track immediately.

110639,AE12AEJFCOGGY,0790742780,"David Montgomery ""Book Critic""","[70, 80]","Some people think this film is about violence or anger or racism. It's not, though. It's about sadness. The sadness that comes when life loses its meaning. The kind of sadness that can drive a man to do terrible  things.Michael Douglas stars as an unemployed defense worker who is  having a very bad day. It starts with him being stuck in traffic on an L.A.  freeway. No one is moving, his air conditioner is broken, and the exhaust  fumes are overpowering. Finally, he abandons his car and sets out on foot.  (The opening scene is an homage to the opening of Fellini's &quot;8  1/2.&quot;)The unnamed Douglas character, as he frequently says, is just  trying to get home. He doesn't want any trouble; he just wants to see his  family. Events, though, seem to conspire against him.Along the way, he  runs into a Korean grocer, Hispanic gangbangers, a homeless man, a neo-Nazi  skinhead, and other colorful SoCal denizens who drive him to the edge.  That's where the violence begins. This brings him to the attention of Sgt.  Prendergrast (Robert Duvall), a police officer who is about to retire.  Before he does, though, he is determined to catch Douglas.Despite being  on opposite sides of the law, the similarities between these two men are  greater than the differences. Both of them are failures at home and at  work. Both of them lead lives that have never quite lived up to their  expectations; lives of &quot;quiet desperation.&quot; The only difference  is in how each man copes with his failures.Michael Douglas is excellent  in this role, playing it in a very controlled and understated way. It would  have been very easy to go over the top with it, but he never does. Duvall  is good, as usual, in the more reserved, low profile part.What is most  compelling about this story is how real it seems. The things Douglas does  are thing we've all thought about doing. The things he feels--the anger,  the helplessness--are all things we've felt. In that sense, he represents a  side of ourselves; a side we don't want to admit we have, but one that we  can't deny.",3,Mad as Hell and Not Taking It Anymore,958608000,"05 18, 2000",2000,2071,"['people', 'think', 'film', 'violence', 'anger', 'racism', 'not', 'though', 'sadness', 'sadness', 'when', 'life', 'meaning', 'kind', 'sadness', 'can', 'drive', 'man', 'do', 'terrible', 'things.Michael', 'Douglas', 'stars', 'unemployed', 'defense', 'worker', 'who', 'having', 'very', 'bad', 'day', 'being', 'stuck', 'traffic', 'L.A.', 'freeway', 'one', 'moving', 'air', 'conditioner', 'broken', 'exhaust', 'fumes', 'are', 'overpowering', 'Finally', 'car', 'out', 'foot', 'opening', 'scene', 'homage', 'opening', 'Fellini', 'quot', '8', '1/2.', 'quot', 'unnamed', 'Douglas', 'character', 'frequently', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'home', ""n't"", 'want', 'trouble', 'just', 'see', 'family', 'Events', 'though', 'seem', 'conspire', 'way', 'Korean', 'grocer', 'Hispanic', 'gangbangers', 'homeless', 'man', 'neo-Nazi', 'skinhead', 'other', 'colorful', 'SoCal', 'denizens', 'who', 'drive', 'edge', 'where', 'violence', 'attention', 'Sgt', 'Prendergrast', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'retire', 'though', 'determined', 'catch', 'Douglas.Despite', 'being', 'opposite', 'sides', 'law', 'similarities', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'greater', 'differences', 'are', 'failures', 'home', 'work', 'lead', 'lives', 'have', 'never', 'quite', 'lived', 'up', 'expectations', 'lives', 'quot', 'quiet', 'desperation.', 'quot', 'only', 'difference', 'how', 'man', 'failures.Michael', 'Douglas', 'excellent', 'role', 'playing', 'very', 'controlled', 'understated', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'easy', 'go', 'top', 'never', 'Duvall', 'good', 'usual', 'more', 'reserved', 'low', 'profile', 'part.What', 'most', 'compelling', 'story', 'how', 'real', 'things', 'Douglas', 'are', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'doing', 'things', 'anger', 'helplessness', 'are', 'things', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'sense', 'side', 'ourselves', 'side', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'admit', 'have', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny']",N/A
110640,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,0790742780,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[3, 3]","Michael Douglas is splendid as William Foster who loses both his engineering job and existential place within the universe. Unemployment was not part of the tacit contract he thought existed between him and his social milieu. Hadn't he always played by the rules and conformed to the standard mores? His marriage to Beth (Barbara Hershey) has already dissolved, and this new crisis puts him over the edge.  We go along with this alienated man as he travels by foot all over the diverse cultures of Los Angeles. Foster ceases responding to the challenges and slights of everyday life in a mature manner. He instead reacts violently to even perceived insults and minor inconveniences. Needless to add, the resulting death and destruction soon captures the attention of the police. Officer Prendergast (Robert Duval) is committed to putting a stop to Foster's irascible behavior. The resulting situations are riveting and may even be found disturbing. One cannot but wonder if they might likewise flip out sometime in the future.In one particularly gripping incident, Foster stops into a hardware store and converses with its ultra-right wing owner (Frederic Forrest). Our protagonist may be indulging in self pity and a sense of victimhood, but soon realizes that he is not about to partner with this hate mongering Nazi. Foster might be bitter, but he still retains the ability to say no to unambiguous evil. The last scene is profound, and should be seen by anyone who is ever tempted to think that life is unfair. Prendergast finally corners Foster and listens to the latter complain how he feels deceived by the establishment. The police man quickly dismisses Foster's excuses--and points out that most folks may have legitimate reasons to feel this way at one time or another. Nonetheless, this still does not justify going off the deep end! The makers of ""Falling Down"" should have been a bit more courageous. The story line had enough going for it that the excess blood shed only got in the way.

Like Richard Burton's reverend in NIGHT OF THE IGUANA, who goes over the edge during a Sunday sermon, Douglas, as the victim of downsizing, makes that same trip while stuck in a traffic jam on an L. A. freeway during a summer heat spell. (I live in the Los Angeles area, and though I have never lost my job to downsizing, I still have total empathy for the character's breaking point every time I get stuck in similar traffic snarls!) Once he gets out of his car, leaving it abandoned in the middle of the traffic jam, and starts his march through the city to go home to his ex-wife and child, we know nothing positive is going to come. The trip is alternatively funny and tragic, thanks to Douglas's performance. He somehow manages to walk the very thin line between his character's Archie Bunker-isms and his character's horrible situation as he cuts a violent path to the ocean. There are some truly hard-to-watch moments in this film (the war surplus store sequence is particularly brutal), but one can't shy away from the out-of-control anger of this poor man, who can't understand why he's suffered his fate of unemployment after playing by all of the rules. Economic forces continue to leave many in similar circumstances, but Douglas starts connecting the dots to things that have nothing to do with his plight: a Korean mini-mart owner who marks up everything, including a can of soda; fast-food service providers who play by their policies with arrogance, etc. The tragic humor in the Douglas character is that he sees himself as the  victim of all these forces and of the inner-city dry rot that he encounters on his journey. (Thankfully, most people shelve their victimhood and move on with their lives, often landing squarely and positively on both feet.) This film is great because it provokes reactions in the viewer, often creating a sense of discomfort.

We as a country, and as a people of this country have been falling down for the last 20+ years. Our values have been changed, and or twisted to survive. It seems as though we want to please everybody, and yet please nobody. Men and Women these days can't just give each other a friendly hug unless the man has a yearly income of 6-7 figures, and anything goes as sexual harrassment anymore. Racism is not going away quietly in fact it's probably worse now than it was 30-40 years ago. Paranoia is everyone's favorite neighborhood to live in; that way they can justify throwing stones at a glass house. For one man enough was enough. The American Dream was dead to him as he was divorced, and his ex-wife wanted nothing more to do with him, he was downsized from his job, and looking for new work, getting stuck on the freeway in 95 degree heat just makes one man finally say ""Enough is Enough"". ""I'm Mad As Hell, And I'm Not Going To Take It ANYMORE!!!"" However, the problem is that this is not what the man wants to really do, but everyone he encounters feels that this is his lot in life. He's a white supremicist, White collar, psycho with pocket protector and a baseball bat. He becomes a hero to one, a robber to another, and a wise-ass old man to a bunch of punks. He just wanted to go home, and see his daughter, he wanted some food, and everyone thought he would do some harm if they didn't comply with his wishes, and he wasn't out to play thier games why stereotype him? Is society's goal that much of a sacred cow to have everyone labeled, and thrown into a file cabinet under thier proper type? Why is it that important? Mind you I'm writing this shortly after listening to Janis Ian's 1967 hit ""Society's Child"", and I'm feeling some bitterness right now. However, after this movie was released National Enquier released an article with Michael Douglas who played the man in this movie being quoted as saying he hates what America has become. In a lot of ways I have too. Unfortunately, alot of the hippies that hated America 30-40 years before have developed the same callous attitude that thier fathers passed on to them. ""Love It, or Leave It"". ""There's the door; you can leave if you want to."" Like ""First Blood"" there's alot of prejudice in this movie, and all the man wants is an anchor to hold onto as his life is in a extreme downward spiral, and all people can do is pass the buck, so they don't have to deal with him. Instead of his wife telling him to just get some help from a shrink there could've been an opprtunity to try, and get him to spill his guts some more, and maybe reconcile, but that's the way of the world anymore. ""God Helps Those Who Help Themselves"", and ""I Don't Want To Hear It; You're Disturbing My Karma."" No one wants to help because that would mess up society's file cabinet, and they themselves could get messed up doing that.

110649,AQLKBEVHUQ0JK,0790742780,"Eddie Landsberg ""My 10th year as a reviewer !...","[19, 25]","The first time I saw this film, I didn't like it... yet for some bizarre reason I felt compelled to come back to the theatre and watch it again... and again... and again...The film is particularly interesting because it plays on a common human fantasy :  The wimpish underdog suddenly becoming empowered and turning the tables on his enemies in a very Hollywoodish manner...  Though many films may have unlikely superheroes, the film plays upon this fantasty to a most ridiculous extreme and the realism inherent in the plot (he's not a superhero in blue tights) is what makes the film so unique... I mean, its one thing to punch out some guy you don't like...  but to gradually acquire an evergrowing and more powerful arsenol of weapons along the way and use them to confront every single menace of daily urban living  ?  - - Oddly enough, though no idealistic Billy Jack (see ""The Born Losers"") Douglas's cartoonish laid off white male pencil pusher turned madman vigilante easily strikes a chord in the viewer... Yes, the guy is obviously off his rocker... but you can't help chuckling at him as he confronts one social ***hole stereotype after another... You watch the film - - understand that he's obvoiusly the bad guy, yet can't help cheer him on as he confronts everyone from gangsters to cheeky fast food convenience store workers (one who looks amazingly like one of the Brady's) ... and of course a paranoid homophobic neo-nazi Army/Navy Surplus Store owner.  - - One downside of the film however is that at times it seems to try so hard to make its point.... My favorite is the ""poignant"" shot of the American flags falling to the ground in slow motion as Douglas ""turns back prices to 1955"" and teaches the Korean store owner a lesson about living in ""his"" country ! - - and also the various ""montage"" type sequences the director uses to demonstrate urban angst with the eerie incidental music... or even the ""not economically viable"" viable guy sequence and the shots of Douglas's character sadly watching him as he's arrested and how suddenly (...oh so dramatically) as the cop car stops he turns to him and says, ""Don't forget me !"" (cue the violins !) - - but the biggest example of the director's possibly intentional use of ""over-dramatization"" has to be the about to retire cop on his last day of work meaning from the start of the film you wonder when he's gonna it, and the director milks this to the utmost in virtually every line of dialogue whenever Duvall's character appears.  - -With all this said, in the end, FALLING DOWN wins back every point in being a great film about urban angst and frustration, even ""white rage"" (though you don't have to be white to associate with many of Douglas's frustrations) and a film that bears repeated watching... all in all, I would say that by any standard, be it a message, action or ""exploitation"" film, this is a highly watchable and re-watchable film, so you'd be at a miss not to own a copy of it !",5,A Powerful Film...,1074124800,"01 15, 2004",2004,2969,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'yet', 'bizarre', 'reason', 'felt', 'compelled', 'come', 'back', 'theatre', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'film', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'common', 'human', 'fantasy', 'wimpish', 'underdog', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'empowered', 'turning', 'tables', 'enemies', 'very', 'Hollywoodish', 'manner', 'Though', 'many', 'films', 'may', 'have', 'unlikely', 'superheroes', 'film', 'fantasty', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'extreme', 'realism', 'inherent', 'plot', 'not', 'superhero', 'blue', 'tights', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'unique', 'mean', 'one', 'thing', 'punch', 'out', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'gradually', 'acquire', 'evergrowing', 'more', 'powerful', 'arsenol', 'weapons', 'way', 'use', 'confront', 'single', 'menace', 'daily', 'urban', 'living', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'idealistic', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'see', 'Born', 'Losers', 'Douglas', 'cartoonish', 'laid', 'off', 'white', 'male', 'pencil', 'pusher', 'turned', 'madman', 'vigilante', 'easily', 'chord', 'viewer', 'Yes', 'guy', 'obviously', 'rocker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'chuckling', 'one', 'social', '***hole', 'stereotype', 'watch', 'film', 'understand', 'obvoiusly', 'bad', 'guy', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cheer', 'everyone', 'gangsters', 'cheeky', 'fast', 'food', 'convenience', 'store', 'workers', 'one', 'who', 'amazingly', 'like', 'one', 'Brady', 'course', 'paranoid', 'homophobic', 'neo-nazi', 'Army/Navy', 'Surplus', 'Store', 'owner', 'One', 'downside', 'film', 'however', 'times', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'point', 'favorite', 'poignant', 'shot', 'American', 'flags', 'falling', 'ground', 'slow', 'motion', 'Douglas', 'back', 'prices', '1955', 'Korean', 'store', 'owner', 'lesson', 'living', 'country', 'also', 'various', 'montage', 'type', 'director', 'demonstrate', 'urban', 'angst', 'eerie', 'incidental', 'music', 'even', 'not', 'economically', 'viable', 'viable', 'guy', 'sequence', 'shots', 'Douglas', 'character', 'sadly', 'watching', 'arrested', 'how', 'suddenly', 'oh', 'so', 'dramatically', 'cop', 'car', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'cue', 'violins', 'biggest', 'example', 'director', 'possibly', 'intentional', 'use', 'over-dramatization', 'be', 'about', 'retire', 'cop', 'last', 'day', 'work', 'meaning', 'start', 'film', 'wonder', 'when', 'gon', 'director', 'utmost', 'virtually', 'line', 'dialogue', 'whenever', 'Duvall', 'character', '-With', 'said', 'end', 'FALLING', 'DOWN', 'back', 'point', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'urban', 'angst', 'frustration', 'even', 'white', 'rage', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'white', 'associate', 'many', 'Douglas', 'frustrations', 'film', 'repeated', 'watching', 'would', 'say', 'standard', 'be', 'message', 'action', 'exploitation', 'film', 'highly', 'watchable', 're-watchable', 'film', ""'d"", 'be', 'miss', 'not', 'own', 'copy']",N/A

However, the idea of this movie is to explore the frustration of individuals when many things go wrong in a short amount of time. The ""falling down"" that Micheal Douglas' character experiences is a falling down from life, and a falling down from the ills of society, and a falling down from a relationship with his wife that no longer exists. It is like a psychoanalytical Die Hard; we see and empathize with Micheal Douglas' character as he becomes frustrated with society. (It is fitting that he should be stuck in traffic in Los Angeles when going ballistic). He becomes upset with the situation of not being able to see his daughter, and then experiences an ill journey through Los Angeles, encountering gang members, white supremicists, and stubborn fast food employees (okay, well I can tolerate the fast food employees). The journey that he takes emcompasses a little of what we feel inside when we are angry at society or people; perhaps the only difference is that many of us do not act on those urges or thoughts. I found this movie very powerful and I thought that Micheal Douglas was exceptional in his role as a semi-deranged individual who has had enough of society. Like one critic said, this is a movie that is doomed to an unhappy ending. I am not rating this movie on the ending, however. It is a very gripping and realistic portrayel of a man who loses his composure and acts on an impulse when things do not go his way. I found this movie powerful, and despite many of the reviews that said that the characters were too stereotypical, I still believe that this is a very realistic depiction of society. This movie analyzes what we do not want to express outwardly, and examines the people who are pushed to the brink of taking action.

His hair is cut short, he wears thick black-rimmed glasses, nice black pants with a nice shirt and a tie to go along. He represents the average American businessman. As we see from the very opening, this man has been pushed over the edge by society. He believes that he is right, and everyone that argues with him is wrong.After a few long minutes of sitting in completely stopped traffic, he becomes so frusterated that he gets out of his car in the middle of the freeway, and just walks off. This is how the day starts for D-Fens (License plate name) as he looses his mind, and encounters many people on his way.

Sometimes there isnt anything worth playing for, but sometimes there is and we forget...if you like Micheal Douglas, I reccommend ""war of the roses"", ""a perfect murder"", ""the game"" and ""fatal attraction""",5,Falling Down (1993),1044057600,"02 1, 2003",2003,845,"['movie', '5', 'stars', 'give', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'wish', 'had', 'contained', 'speacial', 'features', 'Anyway', 'great', 'film', 'should', 'see', 'sometimes', 'get', 'sick', 'everday', 'world', 'cant', 'stand', 'road', 'rage', 'rude', 'people', 'rude', 'customer', 'service', 'then', 'can', 'relate', 'film', 'film', '*BLEEP*', 'take', 'outside', 'world', 'stress', 'sometimes', 'crumbling', 'personal', 'lives', 'can', 'catch', 'up', 'ever', 'feel', 'going', 'snap', 'then', 'film', 'great', 'release', 'yet', 'delivers', 'important', 'message', 'why', 'need', 'stay', 'grounded', 'play', 'game', 'till', 'Sometimes', 'isnt', 'anything', 'worth', 'playing', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'like', 'Micheal', 'Douglas', 'reccommend', 'war', 'roses', 'perfect', 'murder', 'game', 'fatal', 'attraction']",N/A
110660,A1TMAVN4CEM8U8,0790742780,"Gunner ""The GUNNER""","[1, 1]","Falling Down  DVDJoel Schumacher's 1992 movie ""Falling Down"" is a chillingly powerful movie that seems to get often misinterpreted. Don't get the wrong idea, there definitely is substance to this movie--it's not just some kind of freak show.Michael Douglas, in a spellbinding performance, plays William Foster, a man who totally collapses emotionally while stuck in traffic one morning. He ditches his car, leaving it right in the middle of the roadway, and begins an on-foot trek 'home' through the streets of Los Angeles. What follows is a day of extremely temperamental and violent behavior from Foster, lashing out against a Korean shop owner who 'won't make change', Latino gang members who accuse him of invading their territory, a fast food restaurant that's 'stopped serving breakfast', and a neo-Nazi gun shop owner who already has some frightening issues of his own.Michael Douglas is clearly the perfect actor for the role of William Foster. Douglas' terrific knacks for subtlety and dry humor are key ingredients to making his character, despite all of his fits of violence, frighteningly sympathetic. It never appears that Foster derives any amount of pleasure or satisfaction from his violent reactions--it's as if he thinks he is merely 'bringing justice' to the inadequacies of everyday life.We learn that Foster's ultimate destination is to return to his ex-wife's home for his daughter's birthday. We learn from the ex-wife (played by Barbara Hershey) that she has a court order against him from seeing her or the daughter. She admits that he never actually resorted to violence against her on the daughter, but that she ""thinks he could"".Robert Duvall plays Prendergast, an about-to-retire cop. Despite the fact that it's originally intended to be Prendergast's last day on the job, he becomes immersed in the trail being left by Foster. The two finally encounter each other in the movie's powerful 'big climax'--by this time, Foster has definitely reached the point of insanity, or as he says in his own words a bit earlier on in the film, ""past the point of no return"".Michael Douglas makes it seems as though this kind of devastating emotional collapse could easily happen to just about any 'average Joe', and that's where a great deal of the film's power lies. ""Falling Down"" is a thought-provoking movie that really stays with you.Highly recommended for fans of Michael Douglas and any man who has been through a divorce.Gunner  January, 2008",5,"Divorced, Going thru a child custody fight?",1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,2466,"['Falling', 'Down', 'DVDJoel', 'Schumacher', '1992', 'movie', 'Falling', 'Down', 'chillingly', 'powerful', 'movie', 'get', 'often', 'misinterpreted', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'idea', 'definitely', 'substance', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'kind', 'freak', 'show.Michael', 'Douglas', 'spellbinding', 'performance', 'William', 'Foster', 'man', 'who', 'totally', 'emotionally', 'while', 'stuck', 'traffic', 'one', 'morning', 'car', 'leaving', 'right', 'middle', 'roadway', 'on-foot', 'trek', 'streets', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'What', 'day', 'extremely', 'temperamental', 'violent', 'behavior', 'Foster', 'lashing', 'out', 'Korean', 'shop', 'owner', 'who', ""'wo"", ""n't"", 'make', 'change', 'Latino', 'gang', 'members', 'who', 'accuse', 'invading', 'territory', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', ""'stopped"", 'serving', 'breakfast', 'neo-Nazi', 'gun', 'shop', 'owner', 'who', 'already', 'frightening', 'issues', 'own.Michael', 'Douglas', 'clearly', 'perfect', 'actor', 'role', 'William', 'Foster', 'Douglas', 'terrific', 'knacks', 'subtlety', 'dry', 'humor', 'are', 'key', 'ingredients', 'making', 'character', 'fits', 'violence', 'frighteningly', 'sympathetic', 'never', 'Foster', 'amount', 'pleasure', 'satisfaction', 'violent', 'reactions', 'merely', ""'bringing"", 'justice', 'inadequacies', 'everyday', 'life.We', 'learn', 'Foster', 'ultimate', 'destination', 'return', 'ex-wife', 'home', 'daughter', 'birthday', 'learn', 'ex-wife', 'played', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'court', 'order', 'seeing', 'daughter', 'never', 'actually', 'resorted', 'violence', 'daughter', 'could', '.Robert', 'Duvall', 'plays', 'Prendergast', 'about-to-retire', 'cop', 'fact', 'originally', 'intended', 'be', 'Prendergast', 'last', 'day', 'job', 'immersed', 'trail', 'being', 'left', 'Foster', 'two', 'finally', 'encounter', 'other', 'movie', 'powerful', ""'big"", 'climax', 'time', 'Foster', 'definitely', 'reached', 'point', 'insanity', 'own', 'words', 'bit', 'earlier', 'film', 'point', 'return', '.Michael', 'Douglas', 'kind', 'devastating', 'emotional', 'collapse', 'could', 'easily', 'happen', 'just', ""'average"", 'Joe', 'where', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'power', 'Falling', 'Down', 'thought-provoking', 'movie', 'really', 'you.Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'divorce.Gunner', 'January', '2008']",N/A

Michael Douglas gives a great performance as William, a layed off engineer who has a meltdown and a very hectic day. Will is stuck in awful traffic because of pointless road construction and just leaves his car. He wants to see his daughter on her birthday but his mean ex wife won't let him and threathens him. She was a character that I dissliked and I felt great pity for Will. Will has a crazy day where he revolts against society. This movie is very powerful as it shows some of society's problems. Will teaches a Korean guy that the prices in his store are all wrong, beats up some mean gang members trying to steal his briefcase, holds up a McDonald'sish store because he wants a breakfast meal and not lunch, destroys a payphone and much more. The classic golf sequence and the construction site scene are awesome and hilarious and worth it alone. Robert Duvall gives a good performance also as a cop. The movie is hilarious but also sad and makes an important point. It shows how society is srewed up in so many ways.Here's my advice. Don't rent this movie. Buy it.

There's really nothing wrong with this movie that I can think of, its just I'm not big into detective/cop genres.  But don't let the category fool you.  The movie is built like this:Starts out with a man known to the audience only as DFENS.  He puts in his hard-worked hours, and ends up getting down in the dumps one day in particular.  He is divorced, and he wants to see his kid for a birthday party just to give a present.  But the wife is afraid of ""DFENS"" because he can be a little unstable.  Which is exactly what the entire city will find out one day when he just decides to get out of his car (during a traffic jam) and walk the streets to visit his kid.  Along the way, he encounters thugs, hoodlums, neo nazis, road ragers, mis-priced stores, and various other rage-inducing citizens.  Well, with a temper like his, and all of these things building and building, its like the game Incredible Crisis in movie form!But this movie has some boring parts too (has to build a suitable plot).  Between every scene with DFENS, there is a scene where a near-retiring detective takes up one last case on his last few days.  With his pride on the line, he doesn't want to end the case so before his retirement.  So basically, its the detective looking for the mis-understood, ex-husband.  The structure of the movie is actually very good, and it tends to make you think.  There are also some parts that are just plain cool (when DFENS obtains some heavy-duty artillery!).The DVD contains your typical extras:-Language select:  English & Spanish (with subtitles)-Trailers-Interactive menus-Chapter stopsSo in reality, this is an average DVD that I find myself watching more than once on occations.  Other viewers will probably be intrigued by the cop/detective scenes as well, and also find yourselves feeling sorry for poor ol' DFENS.

As a kid I always saw the City of Angels as a glamorous, exotic place, since most movies back then were set there. But upon watching falling down at the age of 14 I went off it completely. I no longer saw it as a bustling metropolis of wealth and sunshine, but as a fragmented, angry, unjust place barely able to call itself a society.Michael Douglas stars as William Foster, a middle-aged, middle-management schlub working at a defense company who suddenly finds himself obsolete in an increasingly chaotic, senseless world. Stuck in heavy traffic one morning, he suddenly snaps, leaves his car, and crosses LA on foot en route to his daughter's birthday party. Along the way he has many encounters with what sadly passes as modern humanity. Only now he's just not going to sit by and tolerate it. He's not choosing apathy like the rest of his fellow citizens. Foster (or D-FENS) fights back face to face, unapologetically, And you know what...he's right every time.Robert Duvall plays Prendergast, the cop who puts together the pieces of D-Fens' rampage. The two men are as far apart as they are so close, but none of the LAPD care much for Prendergast's suspicions.The lazy, arrogant, ignorant, disinterested cops are the only weak link in Ebbe Roe Smith's otherwise tight screenplay (you might remember him as 'Jim Bob' in Fletch Lives). Creating stupid characters to further the drama is just too easy, and every time one of them speaks it really drags the movie down.Joel Schumacher's career has been filled with ups and downs (Batman and Robin certainly ain't one of the 'ups'), but Falling Down proves that he can be a good director when he wants to, regardless of how wildly inconsistent his track record is. James Newton Howard also contributes a nice score (which has never been released), but really this is Douglas' film. He's often funny without even meaning to be. D-Fens is just speaking his mind, but still his views come across as controversial or intolerant. If only more people had the courage to take a stand against injustice in real life instead of 'just dealing with it'.Idiot cop characters aside, Falling Down is one of Douglas's best, and perhaps more relevant now than it was in 1993.The Blu Ray is in 2.40:1 1080p with Dolby TrueHD stereo sound and is a MASSIVE step-up from the awful DVD.

The assorted characters he meets all convey a message and show a  different aspect of Los Angeles. Together, they form a microcosm of our  society. Robert Duval is affecting as Prendergast, a retiring detctive who  follows Bill Foster's violent past of self-destruction across the city. He  realises his similarities to Foster as he does so.

Overworked and underpaid, many people are ticking time bombs, waiting for the right reason to explode.  Well, Bill Foster (Douglas) and his wife are having problems, he lost his job, he can't pay child support or see his daughter because his wife's restraining order, and it's just damn hot outside.  While stuck in a traffic jam - and who doesn't get angry in traffic - Bill's air conditioner breaks down.  Tick, tick, tick...Bill decides the best way to deal with everything is to ditch his car and get a soda at a nearby convenience store.  When a Korean store owner overcharges for the soda, Bill argues with him.  Tick, tick...The store owner takes out a bat and threatens Bill.  Tick.  Bill wrestles the bat away (BOOM!), rearranges the store, and pays what he feels is a fair amount for the Coke.  What ensues is a confrontation between Bill and the rest of LA, as Hispanic gang-members attempt to extort money for a fictitious toll through their land.  Bill chases them away with the bat, and taunts them as they leave, yelling that they should ""learn to write the f'ing graffiti in English"".  The gang later tracks him down and attempts to shoot him in a drive-by.  Oops, they hit everyone in sight except for their target, and in their haste they crashed.  Naturally, Bill picks up their bag of weapons, taunts one of the guys, and shoots him in the leg as a message.Several other incidents of mayhem take place as Bill creates havoc throughout the city.  A scene at a restaurant that has moved from the breakfast to lunch menu by just two minutes, and refuses to serve breakfast, is particularly poignant.  It seems that nobody is willing to be hospitable, further fueling Bill's feelings of mistreatment at the hands of society, not to mention the general apathy among the general public.This film really hits home, and rings true in many places I've been.  Rampant corruption and government waste, worthless leeches sucking an already masticated system dry, and dregs of society ruining everything for those of us who try to do right.  Sadly, it's seems that we are either headed for the future as shown inIdiocracy, or more Bill Fosters running around...neither is appealing.",4,Madness takes its toll - please have exact change,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,2257,"['Everyday', 'life', 'can', 'cause', 'enough', 'stress', 'break', 'average', 'person', 'Overworked', 'underpaid', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'ticking', 'time', 'bombs', 'waiting', 'right', 'reason', 'explode', 'Well', 'Bill', 'Foster', 'Douglas', 'wife', 'are', 'having', 'problems', 'lost', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'child', 'support', 'see', 'daughter', 'wife', 'restraining', 'order', 'just', 'damn', 'hot', 'outside', 'stuck', 'traffic', 'jam', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'angry', 'traffic', 'Bill', 'air', 'conditioner', 'breaks', 'down', 'Tick', 'tick', 'tick', 'Bill', 'best', 'way', 'deal', 'everything', 'ditch', 'car', 'get', 'soda', 'nearby', 'convenience', 'store', 'When', 'Korean', 'store', 'owner', 'overcharges', 'soda', 'Bill', 'Tick', 'tick', 'store', 'owner', 'out', 'bat', 'Bill', 'Tick', 'Bill', 'bat', 'away', 'BOOM', 'store', 'what', 'fair', 'amount', 'Coke', 'What', 'confrontation', 'Bill', 'rest', 'LA', 'Hispanic', 'gang-members', 'attempt', 'extort', 'money', 'fictitious', 'toll', 'land', 'Bill', 'away', 'bat', 'taunts', 'leave', 'yelling', 'should', 'learn', 'write', ""f'ing"", 'graffiti', 'English', 'gang', 'later', 'down', 'attempts', 'shoot', 'drive-by', 'Oops', 'hit', 'everyone', 'sight', 'target', 'haste', 'crashed', 'Naturally', 'Bill', 'up', 'bag', 'weapons', 'taunts', 'one', 'guys', 'shoots', 'leg', 'message.Several', 'other', 'incidents', 'mayhem', 'take', 'place', 'Bill', 'havoc', 'city', 'scene', 'restaurant', 'moved', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'menu', 'just', 'two', 'minutes', 'serve', 'breakfast', 'particularly', 'poignant', 'nobody', 'willing', 'be', 'hospitable', 'further', 'fueling', 'Bill', 'feelings', 'mistreatment', 'hands', 'society', 'not', 'mention', 'general', 'apathy', 'general', 'public.This', 'film', 'really', 'home', 'rings', 'true', 'many', 'places', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Rampant', 'corruption', 'government', 'waste', 'worthless', 'leeches', 'sucking', 'already', 'masticated', 'system', 'dry', 'dregs', 'society', 'ruining', 'everything', 'who', 'try', 'do', 'right', 'Sadly', 'are', 'headed', 'future', 'shown', 'inIdiocracy', 'more', 'Bill', 'Fosters', 'running', 'around', 'appealing']",N/A

I was less blown away by the supporting case: police captain; actually, all the other cops; Prendergrast's wife (yikes); even Barbara Hershey. These characters were, on the whole, shallow, stereotyped, and not believable. No matter. Each and every scene with Michael Douglas is riveting. Witness his character's not-so-slow descent through a modern Los Angeles version of Dante's Inferno. There's black comedy here, but not the laugh-out-loud variety. More like wincing inwardly, because you know it's true: every man has a breaking point.Falling Down is a sort of anti-Death Wish. Foster's rampage here is selfish. While his angst is both real and pitiable, his killing spree furthers only his own short-term interests. EvenTaxi Driver's Travis Bickle acted for others, even if he did so impetuously.When I watch this next, I'll just skip to all the good scenes. Korean grocery. The gang-bangers. Whammy Burger (an homage to the infamous diner scene fromFive Easy Pieces). Army-Navy store. Golf course. The film's climax was, for me, anticlimactic.So anyway, how did Michael Douglas not even score an Oscar nomination?

Oh sure, the retiring cop afraid of being killed on his last day is cliche, but it's not the main thrust of the movie.Number two... stereotypes DO have a basis in reality. It isn't over reaching to imagine the gang members, the convinience store owner unwilling to break a dollar, the fast food joint insisting on ""lunch menu"" only one minute after the change over, the neo Nazi militant, the snobbish country club coots, etc, etc.Number three... Douglas has flipped his wig. He's really not responsible for his actions, as he does everything most of us have secretly fantasized about. It's not really a ""celebration"" of violence, but it seems absurdly FUNNY as he acts out his retributions. He is obsessed with his ex-wife and daughter... he can't accept their loss. His mind is falling down...Number four... The main thrust of the movie is a societal commentary. Everyone is after the ""crazy man"" with a white shirt and gym bag... but when put in perspective, the wandering psycho isn't as ""sick"" as what is ACCEPTED in modern day LA. Gangs, drive-by shootings, rude store and food service workers, closet nazis,  people who are ""not economically viable,"" loud mouthed jerks in traffic jams, country club snobs who can't even tolerate a person ""passing through,"" and on and on.This point is drummed home perfectly when Douglas says to his wife ""I'm sick? Take a walk through this town... THAT'S SICK."" Every weapon Douglas carries is ""taken"" off somebody else... he just absorbs the sickness that's around him.SPOILER ALERT>>> in the end, Douglas realizes he's ruined whatever chance he had for a normal life.

I was just sitting there with an old remote control and switching the channels, and immediately stopped when I saw Michael Douglas holding up a Korean grocery store.  It was a very different Michael Douglas I was seeing, and this was a great performance on his part.Schumacher is hit or miss, and this was absolutely hit.  Basically, a broken man decides that he's had enough, and in his vigilante (kinda) quest to stop the &#34;melting pot&#34; of American society from sizzling with too much change--like a Coke going from 50 cents to a buck fifty--he becomes a self fulfilling prophecy; Foster is the chaos that he despises, the lack of discipline he traces back to &#34;Communism&#34;, both affirming and denying within his paradoxical and deranged character that his establishment roots were always lies.There are some great scenes in this movie, some hilarious (when he beats up the gangsters in the park for trying to steal his suitcase) and when he kills the neo nazi in his foul lair, but on the whole this is pretty bleak.

There was a list of composition terms, like ""exposition"" and ""suspense"" and ""resolution.""One was ""Sentimentality.""  It made me think of this movie.  The writers were trying to place the audience in sympathy with Bill Foster, and did so by creating circumstances around him that middle class white people have heard about or experienced.The warped edge of sentimentality is that, once you're hooked by it, you can be manipulated by it.  So, interest in dramatic quality gets sidetracked by our own visceral need for resolution.  We can set aside our moral objections and hope that Bill just kills somebody.Of course, that's exactly how the makers of the movie reel us in.  Gradually we are manipulated into shifting our identification from Bill to Robert Duvall.What makes this a weak movie, though, is that good movies don't manipulate audiences with sentimentality.  Audience identification is welcome and maybe even essential, but who likes to feel outsmarted or manipulated?When it was first relased, the film succeeded commercially by capitalizing on the sensationalism of its main theme.

110691,A25RN8X70DSZLU,0790742780,JRP,"[1, 1]","For the longest time I have wanted to review this movie. I thought what better time than on the 20th anniversery of this movie & plus how this movie is relevent right now. Cause if you remember in my 20 years ago Bad Lieutenant review I said that this movie is still relevant & for Falling Down even more so. This movie deals with a man that likely has some kind of mental issues along with the kind of stuff that's been going on in the news the past few months. Falling Down is just as relevant as it was in 1993. Directed by Joel Schumacher now I know he gets hated on a lot but I think that Joel Schumacher is pretty good director. Cause I like A Time To Kill The Lost Boys, The Client & Batman Forever. Anyway the movie stars Michael Douglas as Bill Foster who goes by D Fens through out the movie. Robert Duvall as Sergeant Prendergast & Rachael Ticotin as Detective Sandra Torres. The story is you start off with this  man named Bill Foster a man who worked as a Defense Contracter & had been recently fired or laid off from his job. He's stuck in a traffic jam & it's a hot day the Air Condintioner won't work in his car he just gets out & decides to walk home. Also a another man who is stuck in traffic is Sergeant Pendergast who is going to The Police Office it's his last day on the job. Anyway Foster calls his Ex Wife & tells her that he's coming home for their Daughter's Birthday. His wife has a restraining order against him not to be near them or their home. The Police keep telling her that he won't show. You have Foster go to a Convince Store cause he needs some change to use The Pay Phone he is told to buy something by the owner played by Paul Michael Chan & he gets a can of soda the shop keep tells him 85 cents. That makes mad cause he needs the change for The Pay Phone. The owner says ""Eighty fie cin you pay or go!"" Foster asks if they have v's in China. The shop owner says that he is not Chinese he's Korean. Foster asks ""Do you know how much money my country gives yours?"" Shop Owner:""How much?"" Foster:""I don't know but it's got to be a lot."" The owner doesn't want any trouble. Foster's like yes trouble. The owner grabs a baseball bat thinking that Foster is a robber. They have a scuffle Foster takes the bat & says ""You think I'm a thief? I'm not the 1 charging 85 cents for a STINKING SODA!"" He literally wrecks shop & says he's knocking prices down to 1965. Foster pays for the soda with a dollar takes 50 cents & tells the owner ""It's been a plesure frequenting your establishment."" Which I do get a laugh out of I can admit that this movie is relateable with the trials & tribulations of every day life even in todays world the economey is horrible & the price of goods is going up but what this guy is doing isn't right. Foster is in this gang area these 2 Mexican's show up they tell him that this is gang territory & asks him if he can read the sign which is nothing more than grafitti. The gang banger tells him that it says no tresspassing. Foster responds maybe if it was f-----g english maybe I could f---  in  g understand it. He tells them that he's just going home & to let him pass through. The gang members want his briefcase 1 of them pull a Butterfly Knife on him. Foster chases them off with the bat & takes the knife that gang member had. Meanwhile you have Sergenat Pendergast getting all kinds of jokes pulled on him cause it's his last day on the force. You find out a little bit about him & his wife & she's not all there & they also had a daughter who died when she was 2. Anyway that shop owner wants to report a robbery only he wasn't robbed he was beaten up but gave a discription of the man a white man in a shirt & tie. Then you have those gang bangers they're going to do a drive by on him they gun down bystanders & their car crashes Foster takes their guns shoots the leader in the leg with an Uzi. This is 1 of those times you want to root for the villain if you want to call Bill Foster a villain. Then you have this 1 guy in the park that won't leave Foster alone he keeps begging for stuff. This is also where  I stole the line back when I did my Karate Kid III mega rant when I put wtf were you a drummer boy when I was talking about the villain Terry Silver  serving in Nam. Cause in this movie this guy says he was in Nam & Foster responds what were you a drummer boy. Then that guys like oh I meant to say The Gulf. Anyway you have the girlfriend of 1 of the gang members telling The Police that there target was a white man in a white shirt & tie. Sergeant Pendergast decides to solve 1 more case before leaving Law Enforcement. Cause the past few years he's been doing nothing but desk work because he was shot in the line of duty. Foster goes to this place called The Whammy Burger he tries to order breakfast but the stopped serving it he tries to talk with manager & he still doesn't get his breakfast. So he pulls out an Uzi people start freaking out. Foster tells them to all sit  down & enjoy their lunch that they all need their nutrition. He goes around & asks how everybody is doing this 1 lady throws up & Foster says ""I think we have a critic."" He turns around & asks for lunch after asking for breakfast so badly that he held this restaurant at gunpoint. Then you have this scene at this Pay Phone this random guy wants to use it & Foster takes The Uzi & shoots The Pay Phone up he tells him ""I think it's out of order."" Meanwhile Pendergast gets word about what's going on during his lunch break Detective Torres goes to look for this guy. Meanwhile Foster is at this Military Supplies Store that is ran by this obvious Racist. Detective Torres comes in & asks him if he's seen the man they're looking for. He tells her that he hasn't seen him. The Store Owner takes Foster to the basement & shows him all these illegal firearms Foster sees that he's into all this Hitler garbage. He tells Foster that they are the same Foster tells him that they are not the same he tells him that he is an American & he is a sicko & that's putting it nicely. That crazy owner handcuffs him & decides to turn him in. Foster takes a  Butterfly Knife stabs him in the shoulder then shoots him dead. Foster changes into a combat style uniform he walking around & in the middle of this traffic jam there is this guy yelling at other drivers he punches that guy right out. A construction worker tells him he can't pass through Foster tells him that the road was fine 2 days ago & that they're just doing it to justify their budget. He pulls out a rocket launcher & this kid tells him how to use it. This kid thinks they're filming a movie he asks what the name of the movie is Foster says ""Under Construction."" Anyway he fires the rocket launcher it goes under a sewer line or whatever it is it hits the construction site & causes a big explosion. Pendergast remembers seeing a guy who fit the discription of who they are looking for on the freeway he checks out the license number of the car that he left the plate says D Fens they find out D Fens is Bill Foster they go to his Mother's house they find out he was a Defense Contactor who had been let go a month ago. Then you have The Golf Course scene which is funny & evil at the same time. This old man tells him to get off his Golf Course this old man swings the club hits the ball & yells fore. Foster pulls out a Shotgun & yells ""Five! What are you trying to do kill me with a Golf Ball!"" He shoots the Golf Cart the old man has a heart attack he asks for his pills & there in the cart which has gone into the pond. What Foster tells that old guy as he dies is so hilarous. I know it is a funny scene but it is evil caue this guy is doing wrong. Eventually he calls his wife again she knows where he is at so she gets her daughter & gets out of the house. Foster gets to the house where he finds it empty he sits & watches some home movies. Pendergast & Torres arrive at the house where Torres is shot Pendergast takes her gun goes after Foster who has found his ex wife & daughter at The Pier. His ex wife tells him he is sick & he needs help Foster tells her ""You want to see sick take a walk around this city."" Pendergast shows up & tries to reason with him. He tells him he is lucky to have a kid cause he had a girl that died. Pendergast gives Foster's Daughter a bag of popcorn she shares it with her dad which distracts him Foster's Wife throws his gun into the ocean. Pendergast tells him that he needs to be taken in. Foster tells him after I worked to help The Government I'm the bad guy. Pendergast tells him taht he was going to kill his wife & child then himself. Foster wants to draw  he pulls a water gun on Pendergast. Pendergast shoots him Foster says ""I would've got you."" Cause there is a drop of water on Pendergast's forehead. Foster falls into the ocean he wanted to be killed so his daughter could get the insurance. Foster's wife goes back home & tals to Pendergast some neighborhood kids show up for that girls Birthday Party Pendergast tells her to tell her daughter tomarrow. Pendergast decides to stay a cop & that's pretty much the movie. Falling Down is a movie that I saw back 12 years ago & it's still an amazing film. Almost perfect imo. The score by James Newton Howard is pretty good. Joel Schumacher did a really good job directing &  I can say this is his best film. Michael Douglas was great this is my favorite role by Michael Douglas. Robert Duvall did a good job. Rachel Ticotinb was ok.

I had to go see what all the fuss was about, and I am so glad I did. I left the theater thinking this wasone of the best movies I had ever seen, and my opinion has not changed to this day. And to the professional reviewer whose review (above) says 'what's the point?', I respond with: Since when does a movie have to have a 'point' to be worthwhile? Does every movie have to make some kind of political statement for it to be worth anything? Besides, I think this movie makes several points; you just have to be paying attention and be willing to look deeper than what you're accustomed to.First off, the movie would not work without thestereotypes. They are essential to our view on how Michael Douglas' character sees the world he lives in. The movie is violent, negative,and very sad, but that atmosphere is offset by a sense of humor that is worked in brilliantly. I got the impression that the writer anddirector did not compromise their message in any way, and thus I am surprised that this film actually got made in these days of politicalcorrectness. Bottom-line: This movie is not about politics or race or good vs. evil. It is simply the tragic story about one typical man andhis inevitable fall into obscurity.

Palkowski ""marskee""","[7, 9]","In this excellent film, Michael Douglas plays Bill Foster, an everyday man working in the everyday world, although he is not the example of the American Dream (which to you older folks, no one ever is). He is divorced, has a high level of rage, has been downsized from his defense worker job, and is being scr##ed over by the system. One day, sitting in his car in a traffic jam during a heat wave, he snaps, and starts to walk home through gangland. He first encounters trouble with the system through a Korean shopkeeper, who charges 85 cents for a can of soda. When the shopkeeper attacks Foster, he takes his bat and smashes up the store, which after he leaves, attracts the attention of the LAPD. Along the way, he accquires a bag of weapons, and the movie becomes real interesting...We all understand what is going through Foster's head, mainly because when a bad day hits its peak, we all, deep down, want to do that to our aggressors. Michael Douglas is great as Foster, while Robert Duvall is equally as great as the detective on his last day, determined to stop Foster. The DVD, however, is horrible (I only got it because it was in the bargain bin). The video and sound are excellent, but the extras are severly lacking. All there is is a trailer that focuses on the comedy elements of the film. A commentary and TV spots wouldhave been nice!

110714,A3OUKV8KBGUPS4,0790742780,M. Casarino,"[1, 2]","""Falling Down"" is a sly combination of a social commentary, a conventional action movie, and a sad character study. It's an odd and sometimes unsettling mix - sometimes the horror of what we're watching is undermined by the catchphrase-laden dialogue of our anti-hero - but it's a compelling, reasonably gutsy movie that raises a lot of questions.Michael Douglas, mostly known as D-FENS, has snapped. He leaves his car on a blistering day in LA and goes for a walk, only to face a series of annoyances that Larry David woulda loved - irritating convenience-store policies, fast-food fascism, gang-bangers, even a neo-nazi. Instead of cracking wise, however, D-FENS responds with violence and vandalism.Meanwhile, back at the LAPD, Robert Duvall is a low-impact cop on his last day of the job. He's not well-liked, even though he seems to be a perfectly nice guy. He starts tracking these strange reports of a white nerd on a rampage, and ultimately gets involved with the case.The movie seems designed to generate controversy, with its casual xenophobia and the sometimes pandering actions of the Michael Douglas character. Look deeper, though, and you'll note that Duvall's cop is basically a well-adjusted version of D-FENS. Both men feel utterly insignificant, only Duvall has learned how to laugh and get through life, while Douglas is bewildered and disillusioned - and deeply sad.Things get even more confused when we learn Douglas has shown violence toward his family in the past, and may have a sinister goal in mind. This is probably unsettling to those who have been cheering him on, but who can blame them? Douglas is given pithy dialogue and exit lines for each of his encounters, as if we're supposed to applaud when he destroys, say, a Korean man's business. If Schumacher had downplayed the mayhem, or showed the violence as the actions of a desperate, sadly warped man (instead of a spokesman for the overlooked white man), the movie would have more power. But would anyone want to see it? The movie's ambivalence about the actions of D-FENS is fascinating and refreshingly non-judgmental.""Falling Down"" is just as haunting for its flaws as its virtues. If it's meant to be a commentary, it undercuts itself with its action sequences. As an action drama, however, it's pretty deep and fearless in presenting men of quiet desperation - and two different methods for conquering it.",4,A confused and fascinating movie,1081814400,"04 13, 2004",2004,2395,"['Falling', 'Down', 'sly', 'combination', 'social', 'commentary', 'conventional', 'action', 'movie', 'sad', 'character', 'study', 'odd', 'sometimes', 'unsettling', 'mix', 'sometimes', 'horror', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'undermined', 'catchphrase-laden', 'dialogue', 'anti-hero', 'compelling', 'reasonably', 'gutsy', 'movie', 'lot', 'questions.Michael', 'Douglas', 'mostly', 'known', 'D-FENS', 'snapped', 'car', 'blistering', 'day', 'LA', 'walk', 'only', 'face', 'series', 'annoyances', 'Larry', 'David', 'woulda', 'loved', 'irritating', 'convenience-store', 'policies', 'fast-food', 'fascism', 'gang-bangers', 'even', 'neo-nazi', 'Instead', 'cracking', 'wise', 'however', 'D-FENS', 'violence', 'vandalism.Meanwhile', 'back', 'LAPD', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'low-impact', 'cop', 'last', 'day', 'job', 'not', 'well-liked', 'even', 'be', 'perfectly', 'nice', 'guy', 'tracking', 'strange', 'reports', 'white', 'nerd', 'rampage', 'ultimately', 'involved', 'case.The', 'movie', 'designed', 'generate', 'controversy', 'casual', 'xenophobia', 'sometimes', 'pandering', 'actions', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'character', 'Look', 'deeper', ""'ll"", 'note', 'Duvall', 'cop', 'basically', 'well-adjusted', 'version', 'D-FENS', 'men', 'feel', 'utterly', 'insignificant', 'only', 'Duvall', 'learned', 'how', 'laugh', 'get', 'life', 'Douglas', 'bewildered', 'disillusioned', 'deeply', 'sad.Things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'confused', 'when', 'learn', 'Douglas', 'shown', 'violence', 'family', 'past', 'may', 'have', 'sinister', 'goal', 'mind', 'probably', 'unsettling', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'cheering', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'Douglas', 'given', 'pithy', 'dialogue', 'exit', 'lines', 'encounters', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'applaud', 'when', 'say', 'Korean', 'man', 'business', 'Schumacher', 'had', 'downplayed', 'mayhem', 'showed', 'violence', 'actions', 'desperate', 'sadly', 'warped', 'man', 'instead', 'spokesman', 'overlooked', 'white', 'man', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'power', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'ambivalence', 'actions', 'D-FENS', 'fascinating', 'refreshingly', 'non-judgmental', 'Falling', 'Down', 'just', 'haunting', 'flaws', 'virtues', 'meant', 'be', 'commentary', 'action', 'sequences', 'action', 'drama', 'however', 'pretty', 'deep', 'fearless', 'presenting', 'men', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'two', 'different', 'methods', 'conquering']",N/A

110727,APN6DO7VHDLTN,0790742780,Missing Person,"[21, 22]","Joel Schumacher's 1992 movie ""Falling Down"" is a chillingly powerful film that seems to get often misinterpreted.  Don't get the wrong idea, there definitely IS substance to this movie--it's not just some kind of freak show.Michael Douglas, in a spellbinding performance, plays William Foster, a man who totally collapses emotionally while stuck in traffic one morning.  He ditches his car, leaving it right in the middle of the roadway, and begins an on-foot trek 'home' through the streets of Los Angeles.  What follows is a day of extremely tempermental and violent behavior from Foster, lashing out against a Korean shop owner who 'won't make change', Latino gang members who accuse him of invading their territory, a fast food restaurant that's 'stopped serving breakfast', and a neo-Nazi gun shop owner who already has some frightening issues of his own.With its story of a white man 'fighting back' against urban decay, ""Falling Down"" is similar to the 1970 film ""Joe"" (starring Peter Boyle).  A deeper peek though reveals ""Falling Down"" to be kind of a cross between ""Five Easy Pieces"" and ""Taxi Driver"", both masterpieces in their own right--William Foster's wildly erratic and tempermental behavior strongly brings to mind the former's Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson), while the good-guy-turned-violent reactionary element of Foster isn't too far off from the latter's Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro).Michael Douglas is clearly the perfect actor for the role of William Foster.  Douglas' terrific knacks for subtlety and dry humor are key ingredients to making his character, despite all of his fits of violence, frighteningly sympathetic.  It never appears that Foster derives any amount of pleasure or satisfaction from his violent reactions--it's as if he thinks he is merely 'bringing justice' to the inadequacies of everyday life.We learn that Foster's ultimate destination is to return to his ex-wife's home for his daughter's birthday.  We learn from the ex-wife (played by Barbara Hershey) that she has a court order against him from seeing her or the daughter.  She admits that he never actually resorted to violence against her on the daughter, but that she ""thinks he could"".Robert Duvall plays Prendergast, an about-to-retire cop.  Despite the fact that it's originally intended to be Prendergast's last day on the job, he becomes immersed in the trail being left by Foster.  The two finally encounter each other in the movie's powerful 'big climax'--by this time, Foster has definitely reached the point of insanity, or as he says in his own words a bit earlier on in the film, ""past the point of no return"".Michael Douglas makes it seems as though this kind of devastating emotional collapse could easily happen to just about any 'average Joe', and that's where a great deal of the film's power lies.

110732,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,0790742780,Muzzlehatch,"[2, 2]","I skipped this when it played in theaters, mostly because the critics I most trusted didn't much like it, and I wasn't much interested in mainstream Hollywood at that time, living in a big city where I could see EVERYTHING; and I never much cared for Michael Douglas.  I don't exactly remember my reactions to it when I saw it first on video, except that it was definitely better than I'd expected.  A rewatch about five years ago had me really appreciating Douglas' performance, but still having some qualms about the social commentary aspects.The third time was the charm.  While I still have some issues with this - I'm not fond of some of the police station stuff - I do like Robert Duvall and Rachel Ticotin in their roles a lot, but I think some of the attempted comparisons between Duvall & Douglas are a little forced, and Tuesday Weld's cameo seems shrill and almost cruel - there aren't many other criticisms I'd make.  I think that if you can get into 'D-Fens's head, and see through his eyes, and see the whole thing as something of a satire on how we all try to pretend that we empathize with each others' very different troubles and life-situations, it really works.  Schumacher's eye for the various landscapes/cityscapes of L.A. is piercing and really gives us a sense that it's a gigantic devil's playground, and the overall growing sense of foreboding and doom is palpable.But all of that would mean nothing if the central performance wasn't up to snuff, and fortunately it is.  It seems that a lot of people have come around to thinking that this is Douglas' finest moment as an actor and I couldn't agree more (based on having seen only a small fraction of his output to be fair).  It's not just an angry-white-guy character, there's a world of pain in here, and it's never entirely clear that this guy's a raving right-wing maniac, or a racist, or...what.  He's confused, angry, hurt, and his mania has been growing, and that's nicely detailed in the screenplay which helps to increase the complexity and nuance of this character over the course of the film.  I think it's useful when we want to damn people like Mel Gibson to think, well, maybe there are some good intentions, but the cracks that have opened up have allowed to let those demons of racism or other prejudice or hatreds out.  D-Fens is a great example of this kind of personality, one that I think a lot of us have buried deep inside us, though most of us are able to keep it under control.Anyway I'd like to write more about this one sometime, but I think I'll stop at this.  I still wouldn't quite name this a great film, as I think it is a little too confused, and sometimes too blunt, for it's own good.  But it's solid, thought-provoking entertainment, and Douglas' performance certainly IS great.  The DVD is as others have mentioned pretty bare-bones; this would profit from a good commentary track I think, especially if Schumacher and Douglas could be persuaded to do it.

This movie brought back so many memories and activated so many psychological patterns that were already dormant (or perhaps transcended)! This movie was very well put together, and touched upon so many factors. I agree with one of the reviewers, that Douglas enacted many of the things that have probably crossed all of our minds at one point or another, things that at times, we too wanted to play out in moments of utter frustration.I lived in Los Angeles up until when I was 18 years old, and in the movie they show areas that I have been to many times. Its amazing how certain images in films can re-activate the feelings that once felt so familiar, this sense of home. The traffic, chaos, cultural divides inherent in big cities are captured quite accurately in this film. I can still remember feeling this angry, this frustrated, caught in traffic on a scorching summer day, just to make it to a restaurant to have dinner with my family. Fortunately, instead of lashing out like our actor's portrayal, I moved out to the San Bernardino area and then out of California entirely.I know that I am sharing some elements that are personal, when this review should be about the film itself. Yet, I believe that such is the power of a good movie. A good movie has the ability to awaken a youthful nostalgia, old frustrations, old experiences that were either sad or joyful, an endless emotional array of experience. Some people ""love"" these very aspects of the big city that I, personally, did not care for. This movie has a little bit of something for everyone. It powerfully depicts the most basic elements of the human condition, and does so in a way that pulls directly at our internal, emotional strings.One of the things that I liked most about this film is that Douglas's behavior was not inspired by pure malice, in other words, the experiences that ""triggered"" his unconventional responses were things that most of us would also find disturbing. He runs into the typical ignorant gang member who is living off of his parents because he cannot maitain a job, yet claims to own a large piece of land that people who unwittingly trespass upon, now owe him a monetary fine. The closing down of a traffic lane during rush hour by the city, to fix a road that there was absolutely nothing wrong with in the first place, etc. The film clearly depicts how we each perceive reality in our own, unique way, and how such perceptions may conflict with those of our fellow human beings.I totally loved this film, the only negative thing that I can say about it is that at the very end, when the cop is eating pop corn, the mirror neurons activated with me and I ended up with a powerful popcorn craving! It wasn't a big enough reason to deduct rating stars though, so this movie gets a ""perfect"" score from me!Enjoy, everyone!",5,POWERFUL!,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,2846,"['Wow', 'What', 'great', 'movie', 'movie', 'brought', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'memories', 'activated', 'so', 'many', 'psychological', 'patterns', 'were', 'already', 'dormant', 'perhaps', 'transcended', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'touched', 'so', 'many', 'factors', 'agree', 'one', 'reviewers', 'Douglas', 'enacted', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'probably', 'crossed', 'minds', 'one', 'point', 'things', 'times', 'too', 'wanted', 'play', 'out', 'moments', 'utter', 'frustration.I', 'lived', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'up', 'when', 'was', '18', 'years', 'old', 'movie', 'show', 'areas', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'times', 'amazing', 'how', 'certain', 'images', 'films', 'can', 're-activate', 'feelings', 'once', 'felt', 'so', 'familiar', 'sense', 'home', 'traffic', 'chaos', 'cultural', 'divides', 'inherent', 'big', 'cities', 'are', 'captured', 'quite', 'accurately', 'film', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'feeling', 'angry', 'frustrated', 'caught', 'traffic', 'scorching', 'summer', 'day', 'just', 'make', 'restaurant', 'have', 'dinner', 'family', 'Fortunately', 'instead', 'lashing', 'out', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'moved', 'out', 'San', 'Bernardino', 'area', 'then', 'California', 'entirely.I', 'know', 'am', 'sharing', 'elements', 'are', 'personal', 'when', 'review', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'believe', 'such', 'power', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'movie', 'ability', 'awaken', 'youthful', 'nostalgia', 'old', 'frustrations', 'old', 'experiences', 'were', 'sad', 'joyful', 'endless', 'emotional', 'array', 'experience', 'people', 'love', 'very', 'aspects', 'big', 'city', 'personally', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'something', 'everyone', 'powerfully', 'most', 'basic', 'elements', 'human', 'condition', 'so', 'way', 'directly', 'internal', 'emotional', 'strings.One', 'things', 'liked', 'most', 'film', 'Douglas', 'behavior', 'was', 'not', 'inspired', 'pure', 'malice', 'other', 'words', 'experiences', 'triggered', 'unconventional', 'responses', 'were', 'things', 'most', 'would', 'also', 'find', 'disturbing', 'typical', 'ignorant', 'gang', 'member', 'who', 'living', 'parents', 'can', 'not', 'maitain', 'job', 'yet', 'own', 'large', 'piece', 'land', 'people', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'trespass', 'now', 'owe', 'monetary', 'fine', 'closing', 'down', 'traffic', 'lane', 'rush', 'hour', 'city', 'fix', 'road', 'was', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'first', 'place', 'etc', 'film', 'clearly', 'how', 'perceive', 'reality', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'how', 'such', 'perceptions', 'may', 'conflict', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings.I', 'totally', 'loved', 'film', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'cop', 'eating', 'pop', 'corn', 'mirror', 'neurons', 'activated', 'ended', 'up', 'powerful', 'popcorn', 'craving', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'enough', 'reason', 'deduct', 'rating', 'stars', 'movie', 'perfect', 'score', 'Enjoy', 'everyone']",N/A
110739,A35TN5YGURE6IV,0790742780,"""oxzo""","[0, 0]","This film was great because it touches on the realities of everyday life.  If you are expecting strict realism in this movie it's not here.  This is a movie about modern urban tensions and one mans ultimate destruction by them.The film touches on such elements as road rage, gangs, basic personal disrespect, and the feeling of helplessness a parent feels in the face of the dangers of today's world.  One has the sense Douglas is lost and no one can save him except perhaps the police officer played by Duvall.Douglas plays a fellow who is an average guy going through a divorce who is treated with disrespect and contempt at every turn.  He feels his life has slipped away from him and that he has lost his family and all that matters most to him.  He runs into everything from people honking and yelling in backed up traffic to gang members violently accosting him, to immigrant shopkeepers charging what was an exorbitant price for the day for a can of soda.  The monster of the movie is the ""system"" of a society, which has a tendency to depersonalize, anonymize, and let people fall through the cracks.  Something in Douglas snaps at the beginning of the film and he begins to act out as many no doubt would like to do on some days.  In the end this course of action leads Douglas to self-destruction.  One wonders how often it happens in real life albeit through different modus operandi, real life being stranger than fiction after all.Duvall on the other hand plays a cop close to retirement who as he learns more about Douglas and the developing situation begins to understand him.  To some extent Duvall's character serves to further develop Douglas's main character and in that respect is a vehicle of the storyline.  Duvall's character is a cop who goes out on a limb with Douglas and is about the only other character portrayed that is sympathetic to him.  Duvall's character is on the other hand the antithesis in many respects he has his career behind him and is married to a wife he loves.  He is about to retire and leave the madness of the city behind him.Douglas on the other hand ultimately plays a man who is alone in a crowd of millions.If you view this film strictly for the story itself without taking into account that it appears to be making a social commentary of sorts you might think the script somewhat weak.  If however you have witnessed or experienced the road rage, violence, and general lack of respect that goes on in every big American city every day then I think you will see the real point to it.I think it's an excellent film with good performances by the main actors but then I like metaphorical films :) that go beyond the standard shoot `em ups once in awhile.

110743,A1PWXG3AESWKKM,0790742780,phantomofroute66,"[10, 12]","After a bad day at work, from time to time I just put this in the DVD player and skip everything except the confrontations between Bill Foster (aka ""D-fens""), a man who snaps for reasons revealed to us as the movie progresses, and the people who get on his bad side.  Abandoning his car in gridlock traffic, he marches across LA like a video game character, acquiring weapons and unleashing them on troublesome modern stereotypes all along the way.  His destination:  his daughter's birthday party (without an invite from his ex-wife).Foster's anachronistic appearance (a nerdy, bespectacled engineer complete with white shirt and pocket protector) match his plight--the once powerful white American working man who can't move into the present and accept the changes that have taken away his power and control of the world around him.  Not that he is a racist.  He makes that clear during his confrontation with a real one.Prendergast (the cop who is on the trail of D-fens), his basketcase of a wife, and his fellow cops are a complete annoyance, especially his ex-partner who's constantly trying to get him to jump into the sack with her.Foster's ex-wife's unsympathetic telephone needling and admission to the police that he never actually hit her lead one to suspect there are two sides to their story and he has not entirely deserved losing his daughter.The confrontation scenes are a bit contrived, never allowing anyone to intrude and interrupt or disrupt D-Fens's righteous speeches and violent actions against his antagonists.  The scene where he walks away from a carload of dead and dying punks after they've crashed their car trying to do a drive-by on him looks like he's walking off of a set because the girlfriend of one of the punks waits patiently on the curb until D-fens leaves before rushing up to the car hysterically.The one person Foster encounters during his sojourn that I liked is the sarcastically sweet waitress at the Whammy Burger.  She's the only one behind the counter who doesn't lose her cool when D-fens pulls out the AK-47 or whatever it is because they won't serve him breakfast.  He certainly isn't the average jerky customer, and she's going to enjoy the moment, especially watching her idiot boss squirm as he is forced to deal with the situation.  She seems fascinated with D-fens, almost like she'd run away and join him on his rampage if he asked her to.D-fens' only purely heroic act of the day is bashing in the face of the jerk yelling at the woman for cutting him off in the gridlocked traffic.  He probably killed him.  That's one I have to watch over and over again.  So's the scene where he cuts the phone booth to ribbons with the machine gun because the impatient jerk behind him mouths off at him for taking too long to finish using it.  Yes, I get a load of vicarious thrills out of watching this film, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.The darkly hilarious scene where D-fens makes an old fart at the golf course regret not letting him walk through the fairway makes this my favorite golf movie.  I would gladly watch a four hour version of this film if D-fens spent all the additional time wreaking havoc and spreading panic all over the golf course, slipping a 4-iron and a pitching wedge into his bag of weapons, and climbing back over the fence, leaving the course to its onslaught of police helicopters, SWAT teams, ambulances and fire trucks.Having far passed the point of no return by the end of the film, D-fens realizes he has lost the game and makes his most sensible decision of the day.I would love to have seen a series of these movies.

I think it's interesting when you read reviews on this movie from people in the midwest who don't get this movie. People in L.A. on the other hand certainly do get it. I can tell you from personal experience of living there and being held at gun point by scumbags that anyone could be pushed over the edge in LA. I found this movie to be laugh-out-loud funny especially when Michael Douglas orders a &quot;Whammy Burger&quot; and when he tries out his rocket launcher after an argument with a Cal-Trans employee. &quot;There's nothing wrong with the road, but I'll give you something to fix.&quot; I don't think people outside of LA can appreciate that scene as much. And watching Michael Douglas on that golf course had my side hurting for days from painful laughter. Yes, it's sick but the way he looks down at the old guy and says, &quot;And now you're going to die...with that silly hat on&quot;, was fantastic. And how about the scene with the white supremist? If you think this movie had too many stereotypes, then you've never been to LA. It's a sick place with sick people where sick things happen. Yes, it's awful that people get shot, but a lot of people in LA deserve what happens to them which this film boldy proves. Studies have shown that the combination of stress, traffic jams, and smog can make someone lose it. What's the point? The point is you should appreciate wherever you live as long as it's not there.

Unfortunately, Joel Schumacher, the director who turned the Batman film series from the creme de la creme to the creme de la crap, takes a promising concept and guts the essence out of it, turning it into a paper-thin, uninteresting exercise in exsess that ignores serious issues and makes little sense.  Instead of allowing Douglas' character to grow angry and desperate in subtle ways, the way countless better directors would've done, we have Douglas shooting bazookas into the sewers to blow up a bridge.  Worse yet, he learned how to fire the weapon from a young child who thught he was filming a movie (believe me when I say that kids aren't that stupid).  His first violent breakdown happens ten minutes into the movie, throwing buildup to the winds and putting a temper tantrum against an Aisan stereotype in its place (one of many stereotypes; none of these characters are very realistic).  Every explosion of anger is simply that; an explosion, something too far-fetched to be convincing.

110757,A1HFRNJMWCKXDP,0790742780,"Robert E. Murena Jr. ""tedmurena""","[0, 2]","After watching ""Downfall"" my friend and I decided it was only appropriate to see ""Falling Down"".  It has been 10 years since I have seen the film but yet it still is a very effective film.  Feeling like a film out of the 1970's with ""in your face cinematography"" we know from the very first scene this film is going to be making a statement.  However, while many say this film is a social commentary on the average white man's place in society and ""white mans rage"" I am inclined to believe that this film is more of a commentary of the extremities of society and how interaction between social groups is nearly impossible.  The film is effective on many levels even though it does have a very dated feel.  It is interesting and yet fun to watch and even though the geeky middle-aged protagonist (or antagonist) is clearly ""off his rocker"" you can't help pitying him often. The film pulls few punches as it portrays several different social groups.  While the film certainly isn't really believable it is very well done and Michael Douglas does a bang-up job as Bill a.k.a. ""D-Fens"".Starting out in one of the many class-leveling experiences of modern society, morning rush-hour traffic, the film shows how quickly everyone reacts wildly when a person steps out of line.  Dfens, sick of the insanity of the morning, leaves his automobile as it stand on the highway and takes a walk.  Soon in need of change he enters a Korean immigrant's convenience store.  The store's proprietor, though he should be happy to be in America, is less than obliging and sells his wares at exorbitant prices to the dismay of D-Fens.  Taking matters into his own hands, D-Fens lowers the prices of the stuff in the store while assaulting the Korean. He leaves with a cut down baseball bat, a coke and the store in ruins.  Taking his troubles elsewhere, D-fens enters gang infested territory where he stops to read the help wanted pages of the paper and fix his shoe.  He is then visited by some Mexican American Gangsters who attempt to mug D-fens. Though things go badly for them as he beat them with the bat he took from the Korean.  At this point he picks up a butterfly knife that one of the gangsters drops.The Gangsters, who were beat up by D-Fens, regroup and with an arsenal of assault weapons hop into their car looking for D-Fens who sticks out like a sore thumb in the minority filled streets.  When they see him they shoot up the streets killing several innocents though completely missing D-Fens.  In their shooting spree the gangsters also get into a terrible car accident and while losing live, D-Fens finds them grabs their guns and shoots one of them in the leg.  Eventually he also kills a Neo-Nazi militant interrupts a game of Golf and watches an elitist rich man die of a heart attack, and interrupts a caretaker's families' barbeque in behind his boss' mansion.  All the while the police, who remain aloof to D-Fen's wife and mother, close in on this man who continually is crossing societal boundaries.In the end, D-Fens is shot by a police man who seemingly spent most of his career behind a desk and who is also working his last day before retirement.  At this point, honestly surprised, D-fens questions ""I'm the bad guy"", as he explains how the system has ruined his life.  This film portrays American society not as a melting pot, but a salad bowl.  We are all living in the same region but are so very different and so extremely isolated from each other.  While this film doesn't attempt to dissolve out differences it does seem to suggest that we are all by our divisions not able to act outside of our sub-group without grave repercussions.  This is an interesting idea and the film ends leaving the viewer with many questions to ponder.  D-Fens is not a hero but his actions make us question the comfort we seek in our lives and how little we know of the other groups that live in our area.  I recommend this film to teens and above and think it should be watch casually yet with serious intent.-- Ted Murena",4,In D-Fens of Falling Down: Great Social Commantary,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,4020,"['watching', 'Downfall', 'friend', 'decided', 'was', 'only', 'appropriate', 'see', 'Falling', 'Down', 'been', '10', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'yet', 'still', 'very', 'effective', 'film', 'Feeling', 'film', '1970', 'face', 'cinematography', 'know', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'making', 'statement', 'However', 'many', 'say', 'film', 'social', 'commentary', 'average', 'white', 'man', 'place', 'society', 'white', 'mans', 'rage', 'am', 'inclined', 'believe', 'film', 'more', 'commentary', 'extremities', 'society', 'how', 'interaction', 'social', 'groups', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'film', 'effective', 'many', 'levels', 'even', 'have', 'very', 'dated', 'feel', 'interesting', 'yet', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'geeky', 'middle-aged', 'protagonist', 'antagonist', 'clearly', 'rocker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'pitying', 'often', 'film', 'few', 'punches', 'several', 'different', 'social', 'groups', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'really', 'believable', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'bang-up', 'job', 'Bill', 'D-Fens', '.Starting', 'out', 'one', 'many', 'class-leveling', 'experiences', 'modern', 'society', 'morning', 'rush-hour', 'traffic', 'film', 'how', 'quickly', 'everyone', 'reacts', 'wildly', 'when', 'person', 'line', 'Dfens', 'sick', 'insanity', 'morning', 'automobile', 'stand', 'highway', 'walk', 'Soon', 'need', 'change', 'Korean', 'immigrant', 'convenience', 'store', 'store', 'proprietor', 'should', 'be', 'happy', 'be', 'America', 'less', 'obliging', 'wares', 'exorbitant', 'prices', 'dismay', 'D-Fens', 'Taking', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'D-Fens', 'prices', 'stuff', 'store', 'assaulting', 'Korean', 'cut', 'down', 'baseball', 'bat', 'coke', 'store', 'ruins', 'Taking', 'troubles', 'elsewhere', 'D-fens', 'enters', 'gang', 'infested', 'territory', 'where', 'read', 'help', 'wanted', 'pages', 'paper', 'fix', 'shoe', 'then', 'visited', 'Mexican', 'American', 'Gangsters', 'who', 'attempt', 'mug', 'D-fens', 'Though', 'things', 'go', 'badly', 'beat', 'bat', 'took', 'Korean', 'point', 'up', 'butterfly', 'knife', 'one', 'gangsters', 'drops.The', 'Gangsters', 'who', 'were', 'beat', 'up', 'D-Fens', 'regroup', 'arsenal', 'assault', 'weapons', 'hop', 'car', 'looking', 'D-Fens', 'who', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'minority', 'filled', 'streets', 'When', 'see', 'shoot', 'up', 'streets', 'killing', 'several', 'innocents', 'completely', 'missing', 'D-Fens', 'shooting', 'spree', 'gangsters', 'also', 'get', 'terrible', 'car', 'accident', 'losing', 'live', 'D-Fens', 'grabs', 'guns', 'shoots', 'one', 'leg', 'Eventually', 'also', 'Neo-Nazi', 'militant', 'game', 'Golf', 'elitist', 'rich', 'man', 'die', 'heart', 'attack', 'caretaker', 'families', 'barbeque', 'boss', 'mansion', 'police', 'who', 'remain', 'aloof', 'D-Fen', 'wife', 'mother', 'close', 'man', 'who', 'continually', 'crossing', 'societal', 'end', 'D-Fens', 'shot', 'police', 'man', 'who', 'seemingly', 'spent', 'most', 'career', 'desk', 'who', 'also', 'working', 'last', 'day', 'retirement', 'point', 'honestly', 'surprised', 'D-fens', 'questions', ""'m"", 'bad', 'guy', 'how', 'system', 'ruined', 'life', 'film', 'American', 'society', 'not', 'melting', 'pot', 'salad', 'bowl', 'are', 'living', 'same', 'region', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'different', 'so', 'extremely', 'isolated', 'other', 'film', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'dissolve', 'out', 'differences', 'seem', 'suggest', 'are', 'divisions', 'not', 'able', 'act', 'sub-group', 'grave', 'repercussions', 'interesting', 'idea', 'film', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'many', 'questions', 'ponder', 'D-Fens', 'not', 'hero', 'actions', 'make', 'question', 'comfort', 'seek', 'lives', 'how', 'little', 'know', 'other', 'groups', 'live', 'area', 'recommend', 'film', 'teens', 'above', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'watch', 'casually', 'yet', 'serious', 'intent.', 'Ted', 'Murena']",N/A

However, when watching the movie again on DVD 20 years later, it became quite clear to me that the film could just as easily been made in 2003 or in 2013.Michael Douglas stars as D-Fens (the name on his vanity license plate), who at first appears to be an ordinary working man stuck in traffic on the way to the office one extremely hot summer Los Angeles day. He soon decides he's had enough of the traffic, ditches his car, and begins a bizarre crosstown journey on foot. During his odyssey, D-Fens encounters one typical urban frustration after another, which soon cause him to snap completely. He quickly becomes heavily armed, seizing a baseball bat from a Korean grocer who refuses to give him change for a telephone call without making a purchase, and, later, getting a bag of guns from a Hispanic street gang after he uses that very same bat to beat a couple of their members who accosted him. As the film goes, on D-Fens commits increasingly violent acts, culminating in the killing of a neo-Nazi military surplus store owner.D-Fens isn't the only one having a bad day in ""Falling Down."" The script carefully establishes a second main character, a police detective named Prendergast (Robert Duvall), who is on his last day of work before a retirement instigated by his neurotic wife (Tuesday Weld in her last significant role to date). Rather than just slack off and wait for the obligatory farewell party, Prendergast becomes fascinated by D-Fens' oddball crime spree, and he is the only cop to put the pattern together of what's happening.The script takes its time in revealing the true nature and background of both men, letting viewers sense their motivations without spelling them out right up front. Eventually, we learn that D-Fens lost his job with a defense contractor after government cutbacks following the end of the cold war. His marriage fell apart as well, and his frequently stated wish to go home for his daughter's birthday is a fantasy, since his wife has filed a restraining order against him. As for Prendergast, since being wounded on the job, he has requested to remain on desk duty because of his wife's nearly paranoid fears, leading the others in his division to view him as a coward.Although ""Falling Down"" has some elements of a ""Death Wish""-style vigilante revenge film and a very dark comedy, it is a much deeper film, a movie about individual choice as represented by the different ways in which the two main characters react to the frustrations in their lives. Schumacher dangles temptation in front of the audience, inviting them to cheer for D-Fens following scenes such as the one in which D-Fens pulls a gun in a fast food restaurant because a clueless manager won't bend a rule to serve breakfast three minutes late. D-Fens reacts as most of us would like to react in that situation, but even at that relatively early stage in the film, viewers will realize that there's something wrong with him (later, the film makes it quite clear that he was unbalanced well before that fateful day). Michael Douglas gives a remarkably subtle performance here, appearing amiable for large parts of the movie but letting bits and pieces of inappropriate reactions slip out as his character gradually reveals itself.""Falling Down"" benefits from a number of fine supporting performances, including Weld, Barbara Hershey as D-Fens' ex-wife, Lois Smith as his mother, and Frederic Forrest as the neo-Nazi. However, much of the credit for the film's success goes to Schumacher, who perfectly catches the mood and feel of Los Angeles in summer (the movie was actually filming when the Rodney King riots broke out). Viewers can feel the shimmering oppressive heat and dust in nearly every outdoor scene, and almost every location where D-Fens goes is depressingly ugly, either graffiti-marred or torn up by ongoing construction. The city itself is a major harsh, uncaring supporting character in the movie.The Deluxe Edition DVD of ""Falling Down"" that I watched has a couple of impressive extra features, a ten-minute interview with Michael Douglas, in which he reminisces about making the movie, and an audio commentary featuring recorded comments by Douglas, Schumacher, screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith, and a number of others.At one time, not too long ago, most people believed that if they worked hard and played by the rules, their lives would be successful. One economic downturn after another, including the recession that forms the backdrop of ""Falling Down,"" has shaken that belief. The movie is a nearly perfectly set up and realized exploration of how different people react to such a crisis of conscience. The technology may have improved over the last 20 years (no one would need change for a pay phone today), but we clearly face the same frustrations today. ""Falling Down"" allows each of us to look inside ourselves and ask how we would react in a similar, sadly all too plausible, situation.",5,The Last Angry Man,1404259200,"07 2,

The problem is that anybody who upsets him is likely to come off badly.At the start of the film we see 'D-Fens' (Douglas) in his car in a non-moving traffic jam. Its a boiling hot day, his air-conditionaing has packed up and everything is annoying him. Eventually he just walks away and leaves the car saying hes going home. Home it turns out is where his estranged wife and daughter live. To get there he has to walk miles and its his journey home that the core of the film revolves around. The set-pieces in this film are very well done. In particular his visit to a store to buy a pair of hiking boots is brilliantly done. Robert Duvall plays the Policeman (who is retiring that day) who realises that De-Fens is very dangerous indeed. Duvall as always is excellent and in an under-stated way matches Douglas's very edgy performance.The film isn't without its faults. The message that D-Fens is cracking up is hammered home over and over, uneccessarily in my view. We can see this from D-Fens actions, so the frequent shots of people carrying placards emphasing this point weren't needed.

He's been layed-off for months now from the Defense Industry, a job he loved so much that he had his license plate personalized with the letters &quot;D FENS&quot;.  His marraige is over.  He's been reduced to living with his mother, and is too ashamed to tell anyone that he's unemployed.  He's been looking for work elsewhere but is &quot;no longer economically viable&quot;, as you'll find out.He snaps and leaves his car sitting in a traffic jam on one of L.A.'s freeways.  In the next 8hrs he goes from being a transparent man to a heavily-armed, camoflage-wearing vigilante who deals a heavy hand to anyone who gets in his way.  And in the streets of L.A., it's not hard to find someone who wants to get in your way.Robert Duvall plays an L.A. Robbery Detective who just happens to be working his last day before retirement.  He's chastised for having taken a desk job after a shooting incident, at the insistence of his wife (the only character in this movie I couldn't stand).  And he realizes most of his fellow cops won't miss him for long when he retires.  But, he's the only cop who links several violent crimes on that day to the vigilante defense worker.  He further redeems himself by tracking down and stopping the vigilante.  At the same time, he rescues his boys from his wife's purse and takes a stand for once in his life.You'll find yourself cheering for the vigilante as he leaves death and destruction in his wake.  And at the same time, you can't help but feel sorry for him because his life is falling apart, hence the film's appropriately-named title, &quot;Falling Down&quot;.

The performances by Douglas and Duvall are both outstanding.  The big problem that I had with this movie was that it seemed that the director was trying too hard to prove his point.  Here's two examples to show what I mean.  First, Douglas' encounter at the fast-food restaurant is a bit overblown.  I admit that it is frustrating to miss breakfast by only a few minutes at one of these restaurants, but is it really that big of a deal?  It almost seems that the director had to justify Douglas drawing his automatic by having the employees act like complete jerks.  Even then, one must realize that the employees are under stress just like Douglas is and can hardly be blamed for getting angry when a customer disagrees with a blanket policy set by the company's corporate headquarters that they cannot change.  The second example involves Duvall's encounter with his captain.  The captain says something to the effect of, &quot;I know it's your last day, and just so you know, I never liked you.&quot;  My initial reaction was that Duvall is surrounded by the same sick world as Douglas, but would a real boss, no matter how cruel, really say that?  Once again, the director is simply trying to prove his point by stretching the limits of our reality.  Falling Down leaves us with a feeling that we live in an absolutely detestable world.  Maybe sometimes we can agree with this statement; however, I think that the director failed to realize that the world really isn't as bad as he portrays it.",3,"Good concept, poor execution",1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,1579,"['Falling', 'Down', 'movie', 'average', 'Joe', 'frustrations', 'sick', 'world', 'performances', 'Douglas', 'Duvall', 'are', 'outstanding', 'big', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'seemed', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'prove', 'point', 'Here', 'two', 'examples', 'show', 'what', 'mean', 'First', 'Douglas', 'encounter', 'fast-food', 'restaurant', 'bit', 'overblown', 'admit', 'frustrating', 'miss', 'breakfast', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'one', 'restaurants', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'almost', 'director', 'had', 'justify', 'Douglas', 'drawing', 'automatic', 'having', 'employees', 'act', 'complete', 'jerks', 'Even', 'then', 'must', 'realize', 'employees', 'are', 'stress', 'just', 'Douglas', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'blamed', 'getting', 'angry', 'when', 'customer', 'blanket', 'policy', 'set', 'company', 'corporate', 'headquarters', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'second', 'example', 'Duvall', 'encounter', 'captain', 'captain', 'something', 'effect', 'quot', 'know', 'last', 'day', 'just', 'so', 'know', 'never', 'liked', 'you.', 'quot', 'My', 'initial', 'reaction', 'was', 'Duvall', 'surrounded', 'same', 'sick', 'world', 'Douglas', 'would', 'real', 'boss', 'matter', 'how', 'cruel', 'really', 'say', 'Once', 'again', 'director', 'simply', 'trying', 'prove', 'point', 'stretching', 'limits', 'reality', 'Falling', 'Down', 'leaves', 'feeling', 'live', 'absolutely', 'detestable', 'world', 'Maybe', 'sometimes', 'can', 'agree', 'statement', 'however', 'think', 'director', 'failed', 'realize', 'world', 'really', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad']",N/A

I am a big fan of the film, am happy to see it on Blu, but there are so many missteps by Warner here I couldn't in good conscience give this five stars.Picture: The remaster looks good on Blu. That yellow lens provides a nice richness to the urban sprawl in hidef. The clarity, other colors and panoramas look cleaned up, and there is only a sparse artifact depending on the scene.Sound: The old 2.0 - yech.Special Features:Commentary: I am so split on this one. The packaging and online listings show a commentary by ""Michael Douglas and Director Joel Schumacher"". In actuality - that is furthest from the truth. The track actually has Edie Roe Smith (writer), Paul Hirsch (editor), Michael Paul Chan (actor), a 1993 recording of Michael Douglas, and a non-scene specific rambling by Joel. Once this unknown dude starts the track with this lame introduction - I knew we were in trouble. All of the recordings were obviously done at different locations and are sometimes not scene-specific. But, the tidbits of great information from the creators make for a commentary you will want to hear.Conversation with Michael Douglas: (10 minutes) Would have almost wanted to hear this in the commentary instead. They do an updated interview but splice in all of these degraded film shots of the movie. It was distracting but at the same time was nice to see MD come back for a talk.The Book/Cover Art: Warner did that glued-on paper leaflet thing again. I already tore it off and the resulting picture of Douglas with film credits is much nicer. The book is nice, but the essay is more of an ad plug than anything at the Criterion level of intellectual worthiness. The only page I found worthy out of the twenty is the trivia page of five fun facts, which were mostly already known.The Menu: Does not exist in the normal form. The movie auto plays so you have to stop it to get to what they have for a main menu - which looks like a supplemental page. Probably one of the worst Blu menus I have seen. Not a deal breaker, but just adds to the feel that Warner did not put the effort into the packaging/logistics part of this product.Overall, I am happy with having it for my customers. The special features appear to be the same between the Deluxe Edition and this one. Since there are no upgrades to sound mixing, no updated commentary by Douglas, unfavorable packaging and presentation, and some mislabeling I could only give this four stars.",4,Blu review,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,2573,"['Had', 'been', 'hoping', 'title', 'hit', 'Blu', 'start', 'so', 'much', 'preserve', 'here', 'end', 'been', 'bittersweet', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'film', 'am', 'happy', 'see', 'Blu', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'missteps', 'Warner', 'here', 'could', ""n't"", 'good', 'conscience', 'give', 'five', 'stars.Picture', 'remaster', 'good', 'Blu', 'yellow', 'nice', 'richness', 'urban', 'sprawl', 'hidef', 'clarity', 'other', 'colors', 'panoramas', 'look', 'cleaned', 'up', 'only', 'sparse', 'artifact', 'depending', 'scene.Sound', 'old', '2.0', 'yech.Special', 'Features', 'Commentary', 'am', 'so', 'split', 'one', 'packaging', 'online', 'listings', 'show', 'commentary', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'actuality', 'furthest', 'truth', 'track', 'actually', 'Edie', 'Roe', 'Smith', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Hirsch', 'editor', 'Michael', 'Paul', 'Chan', 'actor', '1993', 'recording', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'non-scene', 'specific', 'rambling', 'Joel', 'Once', 'unknown', 'dude', 'track', 'lame', 'introduction', 'knew', 'were', 'trouble', 'recordings', 'were', 'obviously', 'done', 'different', 'locations', 'are', 'sometimes', 'not', 'scene-specific', 'tidbits', 'great', 'information', 'creators', 'make', 'commentary', 'will', 'want', 'hear.Conversation', 'Michael', 'Douglas', '10', 'minutes', 'Would', 'have', 'almost', 'wanted', 'hear', 'commentary', 'instead', 'do', 'updated', 'interview', 'splice', 'degraded', 'film', 'shots', 'movie', 'was', 'distracting', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'MD', 'come', 'back', 'talk.The', 'Book/Cover', 'Art', 'Warner', 'did', 'glued-on', 'paper', 'leaflet', 'thing', 'again', 'already', 'tore', 'off', 'resulting', 'picture', 'Douglas', 'film', 'credits', 'much', 'nicer', 'book', 'nice', 'essay', 'more', 'ad', 'plug', 'anything', 'Criterion', 'level', 'intellectual', 'worthiness', 'only', 'page', 'found', 'worthy', 'twenty', 'trivia', 'page', 'five', 'fun', 'facts', 'were', 'mostly', 'already', 'known.The', 'Menu', 'not', 'exist', 'normal', 'form', 'movie', 'auto', 'plays', 'so', 'have', 'stop', 'get', 'what', 'have', 'main', 'menu', 'supplemental', 'page', 'Probably', 'one', 'worst', 'Blu', 'menus', 'have', 'seen', 'Not', 'deal', 'breaker', 'just', 'feel', 'Warner', 'did', 'not', 'put', 'effort', 'packaging/logistics', 'part', 'product.Overall', 'am', 'happy', 'having', 'customers', 'special', 'features', 'appear', 'be', 'same', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'one', 'are', 'upgrades', 'sound', 'mixing', 'updated', 'commentary', 'Douglas', 'unfavorable', 'packaging', 'presentation', 'mislabeling', 'could', 'only', 'give', 'four', 'stars']",N/A

It opens with William Foster (Douglas) stuck in a traffic jam on the freeway. It's a hot day  and he's starting to become agitated. Eventually he cracks and just abandons the car. The first part of the story shows us a variety of encounters which don't improve his mood.He enters a convenience store to get change for the phone, but the insists that he buys something first. The price of soda is too high so Foster questions it. When the owner produces a baseball bat, Foster decides that the line has been crossed. He snatches the bat and smashes up part of the store. His frustration increases when a couple of gang members demand his briefcase as a toll for trespassing on their turf. They don't realize that he has a bat.Friends of the gang members decide to teach Foster a lesson, but their plans go awry and he's suddenly in possession of an automatic weapon. You can see how simple the plot is up to this point. When he tries to buy something from the breakfast menu at a burger restaurant, he's told that he's too late. He missed the deadline by a minute, but the person serving him won't budge. Foster pulls a weapon and insists. When he receives the meal, he looks at it in disgust. It doesn't look anything like the picture on the wall.In Foster's mind, he's not doing anything wrong. In fact, we can probably sympathize with him at the start of the movie. How would you react in those situations? I'm usually very laid back, but when someone wrongs me, something inside me rears up. Foster reacts in a believable way.The clever thing about the movie is that it gradually increases the severity of the situations. At what point do Foster's actions switch from being justified or understandable to being over the top? Where do you draw the line?I won't reveal how far Foster goes, but it's interesting to see how he thinks. We learn something about his life that makes this particular day something special. When you see what that is, it's easy to see why he started down the path he chose. Michael Douglas delivers one of his best performances as Foster and is ably supported by Robert Duvall who plays a cop that tries to track Foster down. The tension slowly increases throughout the movie in an intelligent way and it's always a compelling story.",5,At what point do you overstep the line?,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,2463,"['Falling', 'Down', '1993', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller', '113', 'minutesDirected', 'Joel', 'SchumacherStarring', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Barbara', 'HersheyHere', 'movie', 'never', 'received', 'credit', 'William', 'Foster', 'Douglas', 'stuck', 'traffic', 'jam', 'freeway', 'hot', 'day', 'starting', 'become', 'agitated', 'Eventually', 'just', 'abandons', 'car', 'first', 'part', 'story', 'variety', 'encounters', 'do', ""n't"", 'improve', 'mood.He', 'convenience', 'store', 'get', 'change', 'phone', 'insists', 'something', 'first', 'price', 'soda', 'too', 'high', 'so', 'Foster', 'questions', 'When', 'owner', 'baseball', 'bat', 'Foster', 'line', 'been', 'crossed', 'bat', 'up', 'part', 'store', 'frustration', 'increases', 'when', 'couple', 'gang', 'members', 'demand', 'briefcase', 'toll', 'trespassing', 'turf', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'bat.Friends', 'gang', 'members', 'decide', 'teach', 'Foster', 'lesson', 'plans', 'go', 'awry', 'suddenly', 'possession', 'automatic', 'weapon', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'simple', 'plot', 'up', 'point', 'When', 'buy', 'something', 'breakfast', 'menu', 'burger', 'restaurant', 'told', 'too', 'late', 'missed', 'deadline', 'minute', 'person', 'serving', 'wo', ""n't"", 'budge', 'Foster', 'weapon', 'insists', 'When', 'meal', 'disgust', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'picture', 'wall.In', 'Foster', 'mind', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'wrong', 'fact', 'can', 'probably', 'sympathize', 'start', 'movie', 'How', 'would', 'react', 'situations', ""'m"", 'usually', 'very', 'laid', 'back', 'when', 'someone', 'wrongs', 'something', 'up', 'Foster', 'believable', 'way.The', 'clever', 'thing', 'movie', 'gradually', 'severity', 'situations', 'what', 'point', 'do', 'Foster', 'actions', 'switch', 'being', 'justified', 'understandable', 'being', 'top', 'Where', 'do', 'draw', 'line', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'how', 'far', 'Foster', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'learn', 'something', 'life', 'particular', 'day', 'something', 'special', 'When', 'see', 'what', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'started', 'down', 'path', 'chose', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Foster', 'ably', 'supported', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'cop', 'track', 'Foster', 'down', 'tension', 'slowly', 'increases', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'way', 'always', 'compelling', 'story']",N/A

I didn't understand the undertones of the movie it self, the meaning i should say back then. I was 12, thinking oh cool watching an R rated flick. over the years this movie stuck with me, a great performance by Douglas, as I am not a big Joel Schumacher fan, even though his little ""indie"" film Tigerland was great. I liked this one too. Over time I realized the storyline, the plight you can say about what Douglas is going through. Middle Age guy, loses job, family, seeing world deteriorate in front of him, the ugliness of America.... hello Capitalism! Hello Merchandise! Buy! Buy! Buy!  Why can't we order Breakfast at McD's or Burger King just 3 minutes after 11:30? Come on now! Cause some guy with a Junior College Degree says we can't cause he has the cool headset and dictates what why we can't get a Breakfast sammy.LOL sorry anyways. With the advent of technology 16 years later, hello Blu Ray, I saw this title finally coming to Blu Ray, with new commentary by Douglas and Schumacher! Just watched the film.... and WOW, with our economic times where it is now.... this films really resonates in the 21st century as it did in the early 90's. Watching this 15 years later just blew me away, I forgot how deep a story this is! Another movie about middle aged guys, over educated, and sees the redundancy of corporate America is American Beauty, another great movie. As I like to say ""I didn't know this was pick on the middle age square guy today"" Even though I am not even 40 yet, is this what my generation has to look forward too in 20 something years? History repeates itself don't it!Anyways back to the movie, picture on the Blu Ray, flawless, WB, did a nice job on the clarity, for a movie that's like 16 years old. Haven't watched it with commentary yet, but will, sure there will be some interesting insight from Douglas.

110783,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,0790742780,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[0, 0]","There are several people who see Michael Douglas' character D-Fens as a hero and this movie as a straight ahead comedy of what happens when a good man gets pushed too far. I try to avoid these people in my daily life and online because D-Fens represents a particular type - the angry white man - that has become even more vocal and angry the farther the privilege is eroded by a multicultural society. These are the guys who claim that misandry is a real problem and post the craziest psychotic articles (the ones about how all heterosexual contact is rape or about how white people put AIDS in Africa on purpose) as &#34;proof&#34; that all Social Justice Warriors (their term, not mine) are crazy and unhinged. You can often find them on 4chan or reddit spouting their inanities.The problem with the loss of privilege is the fact that these guys never thought that they were privileged in the first place. They don't realize just how much easier it is for them to get jobs, bank loans, decent apartments and respect from the local wait staff. They could go to college on their parents' dime and never bother to think about the people around them who were in the same classes and had to do double duty as college students and representatives of their races, ethnic groups, religions. They see people angry about George Zimmerman on Facebook and they will go out of their way to argue that Trayvon Martin was asking for it, even post articles about black teenage males who shoot babies in the face in response. Then they will spend months posting urban legends about &#34;knock out&#34; games all in a never-admitted effort to discredit any sense of anger that might have come from a hopped up vigilante chasing down a black teenager and murdering him.When Michael Douglas first encounters the Korean grocery store owner and gets so angry about an 85 cent can of pop that he starts breaking up the place, he says the same racist thing that you can read today - why don't you learn the language. Why did you come to this country? We do so much for your country. For the Korean grocery store owner, the effort to work all day, build up a business and deal with customers who might be dangerous is a constant struggle. For Michael Douglas, the fact that the Korean grocery store owner charges too much for a can of pop is reason enough to destroy his business and lord it over him that he is a foreigner.From here on out, the movie gets steadily more ugly as Douglas encounters Hispanic gangs, neo-nazis, fast food restaurants, golfers and plastic surgeons who all stoke his anger. The gangs are pulling drive-bys. The white supremacist stokes D-Fens' anger because he has a much more pro-active approach to dealing with the same kinds of people that Douglas has been harassing and bullying all day because they don't live up to his version of perfection. The old golfer is the kind of man who has even more privilege than D-Fens, in such a way that D-fens can see himself as a put upon victim.For me, this movie is best viewed as a horror movie about an angry white man who reacts violently to a world that no longer caters to his every whim. Even though he is privileged he feels weak and helpless and thus makes everyone else feel weak around him.It's not a perfect movie. The broad stereotypical depictions are pretty offensive even if they are from D-Fens' perspective (which is never really indicated in the movie itself). There are points where it seems like the movie wants to be a comedy or at very least a movie that is totally on D-Fens' side - particularly the fast food restaurant scene where D-Fens acts like the everyman standing up for his right to eat breakfast at noon and get a sandwich that looks like the one in the picture when he's really just being the worst customer ever. I would have preferred it if that scene took the side of the people that have to deal with this sociopath instead of as siding with his juvenile behavior.Still, it is a fascinating movie, and definitely worth seeing.",4,Fascinating depiction of the rage of the privileged,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,4011,"['are', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'see', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'character', 'D-Fens', 'hero', 'movie', 'straight', 'ahead', 'comedy', 'what', 'when', 'good', 'man', 'pushed', 'too', 'far', 'try', 'avoid', 'people', 'daily', 'life', 'online', 'D-Fens', 'particular', 'type', 'angry', 'white', 'man', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'vocal', 'angry', 'farther', 'privilege', 'eroded', 'multicultural', 'society', 'are', 'guys', 'who', 'claim', 'misandry', 'real', 'problem', 'post', 'craziest', 'psychotic', 'articles', 'ones', 'how', 'heterosexual', 'contact', 'rape', 'how', 'white', 'people', 'put', 'AIDS', 'Africa', 'purpose', '34', 'proof', '34', 'Social', 'Justice', 'Warriors', 'term', 'not', 'mine', 'are', 'crazy', 'unhinged', 'can', 'often', 'find', '4chan', 'reddit', 'spouting', 'inanities.The', 'problem', 'loss', 'privilege', 'fact', 'guys', 'never', 'thought', 'were', 'privileged', 'first', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'easier', 'get', 'jobs', 'bank', 'loans', 'decent', 'apartments', 'respect', 'local', 'wait', 'staff', 'could', 'go', 'college', 'parents', 'dime', 'never', 'bother', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'same', 'classes', 'had', 'do', 'double', 'duty', 'college', 'students', 'representatives', 'races', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'religions', 'see', 'people', 'angry', 'George', 'Zimmerman', 'Facebook', 'will', 'go', 'way', 'argue', 'Trayvon', 'Martin', 'was', 'asking', 'even', 'post', 'articles', 'black', 'teenage', 'males', 'who', 'shoot', 'babies', 'face', 'response', 'Then', 'will', 'spend', 'months', 'posting', 'urban', 'legends', '34', 'knock', 'out', '34', 'games', 'never-admitted', 'effort', 'discredit', 'sense', 'anger', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'hopped', 'up', 'vigilante', 'chasing', 'down', 'black', 'teenager', 'murdering', 'him.When', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'first', 'Korean', 'grocery', 'store', 'owner', 'so', 'angry', '85', 'cent', 'can', 'pop', 'breaking', 'up', 'place', 'same', 'racist', 'thing', 'can', 'read', 'today', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'language', 'Why', 'did', 'come', 'country', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'country', 'Korean', 'grocery', 'store', 'owner', 'effort', 'work', 'day', 'build', 'up', 'business', 'deal', 'customers', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'dangerous', 'constant', 'struggle', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'fact', 'Korean', 'grocery', 'store', 'owner', 'charges', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'pop', 'reason', 'enough', 'destroy', 'business', 'lord', 'foreigner.From', 'here', 'out', 'movie', 'steadily', 'more', 'ugly', 'Douglas', 'Hispanic', 'gangs', 'neo-nazis', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurants', 'golfers', 'plastic', 'surgeons', 'who', 'stoke', 'anger', 'gangs', 'are', 'pulling', 'drive-bys', 'white', 'supremacist', 'stokes', 'D-Fens', 'anger', 'much', 'more', 'pro-active', 'approach', 'dealing', 'same', 'kinds', 'people', 'Douglas', 'been', 'harassing', 'bullying', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'version', 'perfection', 'old', 'golfer', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'privilege', 'D-Fens', 'way', 'D-fens', 'can', 'see', 'put', 'victim.For', 'movie', 'best', 'viewed', 'horror', 'movie', 'angry', 'white', 'man', 'who', 'violently', 'world', 'no', 'longer', 'caters', 'whim', 'Even', 'privileged', 'weak', 'helpless', 'thus', 'everyone', 'else', 'feel', 'weak', 'him.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'broad', 'stereotypical', 'depictions', 'are', 'pretty', 'offensive', 'even', 'are', 'D-Fens', 'perspective', 'never', 'really', 'indicated', 'movie', 'are', 'points', 'where', 'movie', 'be', 'comedy', 'very', 'least', 'movie', 'totally', 'D-Fens', 'side', 'particularly', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'where', 'D-Fens', 'acts', 'everyman', 'standing', 'up', 'right', 'eat', 'breakfast', 'noon', 'get', 'sandwich', 'one', 'picture', 'when', 'really', 'just', 'being', 'worst', 'customer', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'scene', 'took', 'side', 'people', 'have', 'deal', 'sociopath', 'instead', 'siding', 'juvenile', 'behavior.Still', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

OK, so Michael Douglas's character had a meltdown and is supposedly sticking up for the rights of the consumer.  To think someone could go through L.A shooting up fast food restaurants and scaring away gang members twice your size with a bat just doesn't make any sense.  I don't care if it is Hollywood.  You still have to make logical sense.  There were way to many coincidences.  Things just did not add up at certain parts in the movie.  The acting was good, but of course, what do you expect from Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall?  I thought the background music was terrific though.  It contributed to the movie in appropriate ways, and I think it is what kept this movie from sticking to the fan.
