716032,A24PTVSZSM8968,B00006HAYQ,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","In spite of being a bit too subdued in spots, this movie has a good premise and does it in a tasteful way. The idea is that an ex-cop who lives with a successful publisher has to go to NY alone to start wedding plans while his fiancee is off in Europe. While there, he accidentally bumps into a good-looking woman who is essentially in the same situation. They end up striking up a friendship as they go to different locations to make plans together. While they have an obvious attraction, they they keep it clean and don't really cheat on their fiancees, even though doubts start creeping in about their upcoming weddings as they find they have a lot in common. Not to spoil the ending let me just say that it turns out happily without any ugly things happening to the fiancees. The actors do a good job in this movie and create likable characters although in some cases, they are so reserved that it takes a bit of air out of the plot.

That's not to say that the romantic aspects of the film aren't also enjoyable, because I did enjoy the film -- it just took me about 5 times to sit through the DVD.  Michael Vartan from the Alias TV series fame has been in several romantic comedies like ""Never Been Kissed"" (1999) & ""Monster-in-Law"" w/ Jane Fonda & Jennifer Lopez (2005).  Vartan is an interesting actor.  Born in Paris, he began his early film career in French-speaking films.  He has a charming boyish sincerity that plays well, even in this DVD.  Natasha Henstridge came to attention in the Species series where she played in all three of those movies as well as in ""The Whole Ten Yards"" & ""Bounce.""  The plot is predictable with the two fiancees each planning their weddings solo & then discovering that they've fallen in love.  Olivia d'Abo, who is the daughter of Michael a'Abo from the rock band Manfred Mann, plays Vartan's wealthy fiancee that eventually gets dumped.  The coincidences in the movie are a bit too numerous, pointing like neon signs to the ending where Vartan's Charlie Hudson & Henstridge's Anna Penn fall in love.  This is a nice evening's entertainment, particularly if you really enjoy the romantic comedy genre.  While Vartan & Henstridge do well enough, they still can't surmount the material.

716055,A2LM8Z4RDGGKN6,B00006HAYQ,Sonetto,"[8, 9]","I've read thousands of books and seen hundreds maybe even over a thousand movies.  There are classics to be sure, but only a few basic plots, most of which surprise us only when we're very young and just starting life's journey.  (Everything else is a twist or variation on one of life's themes and plots.) I know which books and movies are classics for me. This one is not a classic but a variation, but it's TOTALLY enjoyable.I've gotten to the age where reading is more problematical than watching movies, so I choose the latter. Something I've observed is that restrained behavior, as that between our hero and heroine, can be just as exciting and satisfying, perhaps more so, as actual physical, explicit lovemaking, which incidentally is usually done rather poorly on screen because most of the time actors are faking it.  I don't find restraint in this film to be a fault.So much takes place in the minds and hearts of the characters in this film ... but, even in one weekend, one can see signs on the faces of the lead actors that things are happening with this couple that lead to an outcome neither had intended in the beginning.  Doubts about their impending marriages were already there, but it took a chance meeting to begin to bring those doubts to the fore.  Hesitancy, shyness, fear of rejection or something else resulted in their not getting in touch with each other for a year.  So what if the circumstance that ultimately brings them together is sort of predictable, their reunion is still wonderfully sweet and real.These are actors who use their craft to work from their interior beings, emotions and thoughts, to express what is inside in a visible yet subtle way.  They do not go over the top, constantly overacting, overdoing, which is one way of acting quite prevalent today, perhaps because the teenage public (the majority of moviegoers, so I'm told) want that kind of drama or comedy.  Who among us has ever experienced something like ""The Wedding Crashers,"" a way-over-the-top film if there ever was one?I liked ""It Had to Be You"" because it was warm, sweet, funny, perhaps even because it was predictable in its ultimate outcome (maybe because chance has played such a large part in friendships and love in my own life).I had never seen Michael Vartan before and was very impressed with how he made the most of the slightly pedestrian script ... genuine, sincere, restrained, seemingly at the beginning not so much a man in love as one resigned to the course of events to which he was committed.  Natasha Henstridge had even a more difficult character to portray ... someone who at the beginning is a constricted person who has yet to know herself, is waiting to come out as the funny, fun-loving person she really is.  That part of herself begins to emerge in the two days she and Michael Vartan's character spend together.  He realizes fully how he feels about her and cancels his plans, but she cancels her plans without quite knowing what she feels toward him. At the end and after a year there is a catalyst that does what any good literary catalyst does (I won't spoil this for those who don't want to know the ending before they see it on screen).This is an entertaining film, not a deliberate attempt at making a movie classic.  It can be enjoyed in the company of any member of the family of any age who can forego a preference for horror, sci-fi and fantasy for an hour and a half.  Perhaps it could have been better if the production values of a high budget film had been applied.  But there would be, even then, professional critics, even some of our other part-time opinionators, who tell us of its shortcomings.
