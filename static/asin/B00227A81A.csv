1248908,A1LFJA7HED1S5T,B00227A81A,"B. Bowman ""Double B""","[3, 3]","I must preface this review by being honest, I was not a huge Scott Walker fan prior to watching ""30 Century Man"". The only one of his albums that I owned before watching this documentary was ""Scott 3"", which I didn't dislike, but overall didn't knock my socks off after a few listens. However, as has happened often in my music listening life, I had a feeling that Scott Walker was the sort of artist I would really begin to understand and become a fan of when the right time in my life presented itself. I was correct, and that moment came after I watched ""30 Century Man"". I had a similar experience over a 15 year period with Tom Waits; I tried to get into his music at a fairly young age and hated it, but sure enough, I own all his albums now and went through a period of a little over a year where I barely listened to anything but Waits' music. Ironically, I can think of very few musicians whose careers have followed the pattern of Waits and Walker: both started their music careers by making mainstream music (much more so in Walker's case than Waits'), but ended up breaking from their more commercial roots and making music influenced by Jacques Brel and the avant garde. The Scott Walker story presented in ""30 Century Man"" will be fascinating to any music fan: here is a man who was in a ""boy band"" in the 60's which was HUGE, went solo and did four albums on his own, only to become convinced by record company executives and/or his management that he needed to release commercial material to satisfy his fan base after following his muse for four albums, made albums he didn't care for for a few years, and then saw a reunion of the boy band that he had broken away from, only to unleash some of his most uncompromising material on their final album. This started a trend of Walker releasing unconventional and certainly not commercial albums sporadically that has continued to this day. (When I say this is rare, I mean it. For example, can you imagine Nick Lachey or Justin Timberlake releasing albums like Walker has when they're his age? I can't either.) One of the funniest moments in this documentary is Brian Eno's statement about the last Walker Brothers album ""Nite Flights"", where he states that Walker's contributions to the album were not only unprecedented at the time, but have not been topped by any of the bands that have come since, including the Talking Heads. I also found the interview segments with Walker to be very revealing, as well as the clips of him in the studio having various contraptions built for the recording of his most recent album ""The Drift"". The interviews revealed Walker to be a down to earth human being, certainly one who is not fond of the spotlight, but one who believes in his muse wholeheartedly and follows it wherever it takes him without question. That is the mark of a true artist in my opinion; not success, not monetary gain, not fame, but the belief in yourself to be true to your heart. After watching this documentary, I purchased Walker's entire catalogue, and am a few albums into the listening experience as I write this. It is an unorthodox, but ultimately rewarding ride to these open ears.",5,A true original...,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,3167,"['must', 'preface', 'review', 'being', 'honest', 'was', 'not', 'huge', 'Scott', 'Walker', 'fan', 'prior', 'watching', '30', 'Century', 'Man', 'only', 'one', 'albums', 'owned', 'watching', 'documentary', 'was', 'Scott', '3', 'did', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'knock', 'socks', 'off', 'few', 'listens', 'However', 'happened', 'often', 'music', 'listening', 'life', 'had', 'feeling', 'Scott', 'Walker', 'was', 'sort', 'artist', 'would', 'really', 'begin', 'understand', 'become', 'fan', 'when', 'right', 'time', 'life', 'presented', 'was', 'correct', 'moment', 'came', 'watched', '30', 'Century', 'Man', 'had', 'similar', 'experience', '15', 'year', 'period', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'tried', 'get', 'music', 'fairly', 'young', 'age', 'hated', 'sure', 'enough', 'own', 'albums', 'now', 'went', 'period', 'little', 'over', 'year', 'where', 'barely', 'listened', 'anything', 'Waits', 'music', 'Ironically', 'can', 'think', 'very', 'few', 'musicians', 'careers', 'have', 'followed', 'pattern', 'Waits', 'Walker', 'started', 'music', 'careers', 'making', 'mainstream', 'music', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'Walker', 'case', 'Waits', 'ended', 'up', 'breaking', 'more', 'commercial', 'roots', 'making', 'music', 'influenced', 'Jacques', 'Brel', 'avant', 'garde', 'Scott', 'Walker', 'story', 'presented', '30', 'Century', 'Man', 'will', 'be', 'fascinating', 'music', 'fan', 'here', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'boy', 'band', '60', 'was', 'HUGE', 'went', 'solo', 'did', 'four', 'albums', 'own', 'only', 'become', 'convinced', 'record', 'company', 'executives', 'and/or', 'management', 'needed', 'release', 'commercial', 'material', 'satisfy', 'fan', 'base', 'following', 'muse', 'four', 'albums', 'made', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'few', 'years', 'then', 'saw', 'reunion', 'boy', 'band', 'had', 'broken', 'away', 'only', 'unleash', 'most', 'uncompromising', 'material', 'final', 'album', 'started', 'trend', 'Walker', 'releasing', 'unconventional', 'certainly', 'not', 'commercial', 'albums', 'sporadically', 'continued', 'day', 'When', 'say', 'rare', 'mean', 'example', 'can', 'imagine', 'Nick', 'Lachey', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'releasing', 'albums', 'Walker', 'when', ""'re"", 'age', 'ca', ""n't"", 'either', 'One', 'funniest', 'moments', 'documentary', 'Brian', 'Eno', 'statement', 'last', 'Walker', 'Brothers', 'album', 'Nite', 'Flights', 'where', 'Walker', 'contributions', 'album', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'unprecedented', 'time', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'topped', 'bands', 'have', 'come', 'including', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'also', 'found', 'interview', 'segments', 'Walker', 'be', 'very', 'revealing', 'as', 'well', 'clips', 'studio', 'having', 'various', 'contraptions', 'built', 'recording', 'most', 'recent', 'album', 'Drift', 'interviews', 'revealed', 'Walker', 'be', 'down', 'earth', 'human', 'being', 'certainly', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'fond', 'spotlight', 'one', 'who', 'muse', 'wholeheartedly', 'question', 'mark', 'true', 'artist', 'opinion', 'not', 'success', 'not', 'monetary', 'gain', 'not', 'fame', 'belief', 'be', 'true', 'heart', 'watching', 'documentary', 'purchased', 'Walker', 'entire', 'catalogue', 'am', 'few', 'albums', 'listening', 'experience', 'write', 'unorthodox', 'ultimately', 'rewarding', 'ride', 'open', 'ears']",N/A
1248909,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B00227A81A,Christopher Culver,"[31, 32]","Scott Walker is a figure more talked about than heard for many music lovers. As a fan of the 4AD record label, I heard Walker's name come up again and again, whether it was as the inspiration for Brendan Perry's vocals or the aesthetic of Cocteau Twins bassist Simon Raymonde (whose father Ivor recorded Walker's youthful music). Walker himself was signed to this very label at the age of 60. After Walker released his albumThe Driftin 2006, I felt the time was right to finally encounter this musician, but I wanted some historical background on the Walker phenomenon. The documentary 30 CENTURY MAN is a good way to quickly get up to speed.The film is divided into two parts. The first is the story of Walker's career and the effect it had on musicians who worked with him and who listened to the albums he released. Artist interviews include members of Radiohead, Sting, David Bowie, Simon Raymonde, Allison Goldfrapp, and Jarvis Cocker. There's a great deal of archival interview footage with Walker from the 1960s through the 1980s. The second part consists of scenes from the recording of THE DRIFT. Here one can see how Walker created some of the bizarre sonorities on the record, for example having workmen construct an elaborate wooden structure just to get the precise slamming sound he wanted. Much of THE DRIFT is piercing noise of uncertain origin, but the documentary gives you an idea of the instrumental forces used. It's remarkable how humble a musician Scott Walker comes across as in the interviews, absolutely sure of his aesthetic direction but very understanding that it won't be everyone's cup of tea. While not the nutty recluse that some suspected he was, Walker still clearly likes his privacy, but he opens up enough that the viewer feels a deepened understanding of his work.",5,"A very entertaining way to catch up on the Scott Walker phenomenon, half a century active and still breaking new ground",1245283200,"06 18, 2009",2009,1803,"['Scott', 'Walker', 'figure', 'more', 'talked', 'heard', 'many', 'music', 'lovers', 'fan', '4AD', 'record', 'label', 'heard', 'Walker', 'name', 'come', 'up', 'again', 'again', 'was', 'inspiration', 'Brendan', 'Perry', 'vocals', 'aesthetic', 'Cocteau', 'Twins', 'bassist', 'Simon', 'Raymonde', 'father', 'Ivor', 'recorded', 'Walker', 'youthful', 'music', 'Walker', 'was', 'signed', 'very', 'label', 'age', '60', 'Walker', 'released', 'albumThe', 'Driftin', '2006', 'felt', 'time', 'was', 'right', 'finally', 'encounter', 'musician', 'wanted', 'historical', 'background', 'Walker', 'phenomenon', 'documentary', '30', 'CENTURY', 'MAN', 'good', 'way', 'quickly', 'get', 'up', 'speed.The', 'film', 'divided', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'story', 'Walker', 'career', 'effect', 'had', 'musicians', 'who', 'worked', 'who', 'listened', 'albums', 'released', 'Artist', 'interviews', 'include', 'members', 'Radiohead', 'Sting', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Simon', 'Raymonde', 'Allison', 'Goldfrapp', 'Jarvis', 'Cocker', 'great', 'deal', 'archival', 'interview', 'footage', 'Walker', '1960s', '1980s', 'second', 'part', 'scenes', 'recording', 'THE', 'DRIFT', 'Here', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'Walker', 'created', 'bizarre', 'sonorities', 'record', 'example', 'having', 'workmen', 'construct', 'elaborate', 'wooden', 'structure', 'just', 'get', 'precise', 'slamming', 'sound', 'wanted', 'Much', 'THE', 'DRIFT', 'piercing', 'noise', 'uncertain', 'origin', 'documentary', 'idea', 'instrumental', 'forces', 'used', 'remarkable', 'how', 'humble', 'musician', 'Scott', 'Walker', 'across', 'interviews', 'absolutely', 'sure', 'aesthetic', 'direction', 'very', 'understanding', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'not', 'nutty', 'recluse', 'suspected', 'was', 'Walker', 'still', 'clearly', 'privacy', 'up', 'enough', 'viewer', 'deepened', 'understanding', 'work']",N/A
1248910,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00227A81A,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 6]","Film director Stephen Kijak's film is to be commended for never descending into minutia on Engel's life. In fact, virtually nothing, after the initial information on Engle's youth, is mentioned of his private life. This is refreshing, for it lifts the film well above any claims of being a vanity documentary. The negative is that Engel's `art' is simply not good. Yes, he had a deep, powerful bass voice, and it was put to great effect in the early recordings. But, listening to his latest efforts, not only are his lyrics bad (Jim Morrison, Walker is not, even as some talking heads bizarrely link him to T.S. Eliot, Samuel Beckett, and James Joyce)- in a jumbled sense, but they border on PC and the `music,' such as it is, is random and found noise, not harmonies and melodies. To top it off, Engel's voice is a dim echo of its former glory, often descending into what seems like a parody of some local 1960s television station's late night horror film show host's attempt at singing to a bad B film.Initially, the film plays out like a mockumentary, but the infusion of vintage television clips dashes that surmise. What is not dashed is the reality of how limited the `art' of Engel's music. Great art does art well. Visionary art pushes boundaries, as well. But, to push the boundaries back, the artist has to stay anchored to the extremes, at least of the art form. In the case of music, this means non-banal lyrics, damning predictable percussion, varying melodies and other such extensions. Simply going off into a corner and wailing, or grunting, is not an extension of music nor singing, as arts. Of course, that is hyperbole, but Walker's latest efforts smack of a phenomenon known in the arts- that of the spent artist realizing he'll never duplicate his earlier successes, so he just preens and deranges, then hides behind the veneer of his earlier success, as a `genius,' or the like (and it's no shock to know Engel worships the Beatniks). Engel simply never expands the boundaries of music- pop nor otherwise, even as talking heads damn many of the progressive rock acts of the 1970s that went far beyond Walker's experimentalism: Yes, King Crimson, and others.Scott Walker: 30 Century Man (the title taken from an Engel song) is a well wrought and exquisitely structured film on an ultimately interesting subject, but that subject is not Engel nor music nor art, but the peregrinations of the spent artist in search of that golden nipple needed to nurse him into senescence's uneasy drool. Now, if only director Kijack can find an artist and subject worthy of his talents, the film will be a landmark in the genre.",3,Good,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,2633,"['Film', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Kijak', 'film', 'be', 'commended', 'never', 'descending', 'minutia', 'Engel', 'life', 'fact', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'initial', 'information', 'Engle', 'youth', 'mentioned', 'private', 'life', 'refreshing', 'film', 'well', 'claims', 'being', 'vanity', 'documentary', 'negative', 'Engel', 'art', 'simply', 'not', 'good', 'Yes', 'had', 'deep', 'powerful', 'bass', 'voice', 'was', 'put', 'great', 'effect', 'early', 'recordings', 'listening', 'latest', 'efforts', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'lyrics', 'bad', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Walker', 'not', 'even', 'talking', 'heads', 'bizarrely', 'link', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'Samuel', 'Beckett', 'James', 'Joyce', 'jumbled', 'sense', 'border', 'PC', 'music', 'such', 'random', 'found', 'noise', 'not', 'harmonies', 'melodies', 'top', 'off', 'Engel', 'voice', 'dim', 'echo', 'former', 'glory', 'often', 'descending', 'what', 'parody', 'local', '1960s', 'television', 'station', 'late', 'night', 'horror', 'film', 'show', 'host', 'attempt', 'singing', 'bad', 'B', 'film.Initially', 'film', 'out', 'mockumentary', 'infusion', 'vintage', 'television', 'clips', 'surmise', 'What', 'not', 'dashed', 'reality', 'how', 'limited', 'art', 'Engel', 'music', 'Great', 'art', 'art', 'well', 'Visionary', 'art', 'pushes', 'boundaries', 'as', 'well', 'push', 'boundaries', 'back', 'artist', 'stay', 'anchored', 'extremes', 'least', 'art', 'form', 'case', 'music', 'non-banal', 'lyrics', 'damning', 'predictable', 'percussion', 'varying', 'melodies', 'other', 'such', 'extensions', 'Simply', 'going', 'off', 'corner', 'wailing', 'grunting', 'not', 'extension', 'music', 'singing', 'arts', 'course', 'hyperbole', 'Walker', 'latest', 'efforts', 'smack', 'phenomenon', 'known', 'arts-', 'spent', 'artist', 'realizing', ""'ll"", 'never', 'duplicate', 'earlier', 'successes', 'just', 'preens', 'deranges', 'then', 'veneer', 'earlier', 'success', 'genius', 'like', 'shock', 'know', 'Engel', 'Beatniks', 'Engel', 'simply', 'never', 'boundaries', 'music-', 'pop', 'otherwise', 'even', 'talking', 'heads', 'damn', 'many', 'progressive', 'rock', 'acts', '1970s', 'went', 'far', 'Walker', 'experimentalism', 'Yes', 'King', 'Crimson', 'others.Scott', 'Walker', '30', 'Century', 'Man', 'title', 'taken', 'Engel', 'song', 'well', 'wrought', 'exquisitely', 'structured', 'film', 'ultimately', 'interesting', 'subject', 'subject', 'not', 'Engel', 'music', 'art', 'peregrinations', 'spent', 'artist', 'search', 'golden', 'nipple', 'needed', 'nurse', 'senescence', 'uneasy', 'drool', 'Now', 'only', 'director', 'Kijack', 'can', 'find', 'artist', 'subject', 'worthy', 'talents', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'landmark', 'genre']",N/A

Recently Sun aint gonna shine was used for the trailer of AMCs Walking Dead series, and I downloaded the song and listened to it over and over again just two weeks ago.

For me, discovering Walkers musical genious was imperative for my own musical journey, because for some time now I have my self been a solo artist who has created some pretty dark experimental material.
