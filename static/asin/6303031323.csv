351648,A3MQQS40FK2QAQ,6303031323,"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle""","[1, 1]","I first read THE CHOCOLATE WAR during my senior year in high school. It became one of my favorite novels. It is one of the creepiest books I had read and I could understand why it was banned in some high schools, even to this day. When the film came out in November, 1988 I went to see it with full eagerness. I only knew Keith Gordon as an actor, but he was a surprisingly good one. I wanted to see what he would do with a film version of the movie. I had not seen a single clip from the movie or a trailer for it, so I knew virtually nothing about it. When it was over, I thought it was really good except for the ending. (SPOILER WARNING). Keith Gordon changed the ending from the original book and I thought it was trying to tack on an upbeat ending to a disturbing story.In the 1990's I purchased the film on Laserdisc. Included was a printed interview with Gordon, and he explained exactly why the ending was changed. This DVD version includes a recent interview with him, and he goes into more detail about why he did that. If you only remember him as an actor from the films such as CHRISTINE, BACK TO SCHOOL, and DRESSED TO KILL you will not recognize him today. Or, maybe you will. His explanation for why the ending was changed for the movie makes an incredible amount of sense. And when I viewed the film on Laserdisc I had changed my mind about that ending.The story takes place in a Catholic prep school named Trinity. We never know what town it's located in, although I suspect it's somewhere in New England. The school is kept under control by a not-so-secret society called The Vigils. Three students run the group: Archie (Wally Ward), a President named Carter (Adam Baldwin), and a secretary named Obie (Doug Hutchinson). Archie assigns kids to do certain stunts, like a freshman named The Goober, who is to take the desks, chairs, and blackboard in a classroom apart. An ambitious teacher named Brother Leon (John Glover) plans to save the school from financial ruin by holding a chocolate sale. He doubles the amount of chocolates from the previous year, and asks Archie and The Vigils to help out. Archie assigns another freshman named Jerry Renault (Ilan Mitchell Smith) to not sell the chocolates for ten days, and then sell them.This assignment backfires on Archie, the Vigils, and for Brother Leon, because Jerry refuses to sell the chocolates after the ten days. And on top of that, the sales of the chocolates go down as other students start to follow Jerry's lead. The chocolate sale comes to a halt, and Brother Leon blames Archie for all of it. Archie soon organizes The Vigils to get the sale over with, and to stage a big humiliation for Jerry in front of the whole school. That humiliation actually backfires for both Jerry and Archie.Keith Gordon directs with a lot of imagery and a well placed sense of where to put his camera. He uses several dream sequences that were never included in the original book. When we meet Brother Leon he has a long, unbroken shot of John Glover as well as a monologue that he delivers in front of his class. The monologue becomes really intriguing and gets your attention. If Gordon's visual style reminds you of Brian DePalma it should. DePalma was Gordon's mentor when they made DRESSED TO KILL together. He taught the young actor all about the variety of visual tricks that could be done with the camera.Robert Cormier wrote his own sequel to THE CHOCOLATE WAR, titled BEYOND THE CHOCOLATE WAR. Looking at the ending to Gordon's film adaptation it doesn't set itself up for an adaptation of Cormier's sequel. But having listened to Keith Gordon's conversation that's included in this DVD version and looked at the film I could pretty much tell the theme he was trying to get at. Watch this movie on DVD and you will understand that theme.",4,An excellent adaptation and an impressive directing debut,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,3809,"['first', 'read', 'THE', 'CHOCOLATE', 'WAR', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'became', 'one', 'favorite', 'novels', 'one', 'creepiest', 'books', 'had', 'read', 'could', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'banned', 'high', 'schools', 'even', 'day', 'When', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'November', '1988', 'went', 'see', 'full', 'eagerness', 'only', 'knew', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'actor', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'one', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'film', 'version', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'single', 'clip', 'movie', 'trailer', 'so', 'knew', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'When', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'ending', 'SPOILER', 'WARNING', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'changed', 'ending', 'original', 'book', 'thought', 'was', 'trying', 'tack', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'disturbing', 'story.In', '1990', 'purchased', 'film', 'Laserdisc', 'Included', 'was', 'printed', 'interview', 'Gordon', 'explained', 'exactly', 'why', 'ending', 'was', 'changed', 'DVD', 'version', 'recent', 'interview', 'more', 'detail', 'why', 'did', 'only', 'remember', 'actor', 'films', 'such', 'CHRISTINE', 'BACK', 'TO', 'SCHOOL', 'DRESSED', 'TO', 'KILL', 'will', 'not', 'recognize', 'today', 'maybe', 'will', 'explanation', 'why', 'ending', 'was', 'changed', 'movie', 'incredible', 'amount', 'sense', 'when', 'viewed', 'film', 'Laserdisc', 'had', 'changed', 'mind', 'ending.The', 'story', 'place', 'Catholic', 'prep', 'school', 'named', 'Trinity', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'town', 'located', 'suspect', 'somewhere', 'New', 'England', 'school', 'kept', 'control', 'not-so-secret', 'society', 'called', 'Vigils', 'Three', 'students', 'run', 'group', 'Archie', 'Wally', 'Ward', 'President', 'named', 'Carter', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'secretary', 'named', 'Obie', 'Doug', 'Hutchinson', 'Archie', 'assigns', 'kids', 'do', 'certain', 'stunts', 'freshman', 'named', 'Goober', 'who', 'take', 'desks', 'chairs', 'blackboard', 'classroom', 'apart', 'ambitious', 'teacher', 'named', 'Brother', 'Leon', 'John', 'Glover', 'save', 'school', 'financial', 'ruin', 'holding', 'chocolate', 'sale', 'amount', 'chocolates', 'previous', 'year', 'Archie', 'Vigils', 'help', 'out', 'Archie', 'freshman', 'named', 'Jerry', 'Renault', 'Ilan', 'Mitchell', 'Smith', 'not', 'sell', 'chocolates', 'ten', 'days', 'then', 'sell', 'them.This', 'assignment', 'backfires', 'Archie', 'Vigils', 'Brother', 'Leon', 'Jerry', 'sell', 'chocolates', 'ten', 'days', 'top', 'sales', 'chocolates', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'other', 'students', 'start', 'follow', 'Jerry', 'lead', 'chocolate', 'sale', 'halt', 'Brother', 'Leon', 'Archie', 'Archie', 'soon', 'Vigils', 'get', 'sale', 'stage', 'big', 'humiliation', 'Jerry', 'front', 'whole', 'school', 'humiliation', 'actually', 'Jerry', 'Archie.Keith', 'Gordon', 'lot', 'imagery', 'well', 'placed', 'sense', 'where', 'put', 'camera', 'several', 'dream', 'sequences', 'were', 'never', 'included', 'original', 'book', 'When', 'meet', 'Brother', 'Leon', 'long', 'unbroken', 'shot', 'John', 'Glover', 'as', 'well', 'monologue', 'front', 'class', 'monologue', 'really', 'intriguing', 'attention', 'Gordon', 'visual', 'style', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'should', 'DePalma', 'was', 'Gordon', 'mentor', 'when', 'made', 'DRESSED', 'TO', 'KILL', 'together', 'taught', 'young', 'actor', 'variety', 'visual', 'tricks', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'camera.Robert', 'Cormier', 'wrote', 'own', 'sequel', 'THE', 'CHOCOLATE', 'WAR', 'titled', 'BEYOND', 'THE', 'CHOCOLATE', 'WAR', 'Looking', 'ending', 'Gordon', 'film', 'adaptation', ""n't"", 'set', 'up', 'adaptation', 'Cormier', 'sequel', 'having', 'listened', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'conversation', 'included', 'DVD', 'version', 'looked', 'film', 'could', 'pretty', 'much', 'tell', 'theme', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'Watch', 'movie', 'DVD', 'will', 'understand', 'theme']",N/A

351650,A1TJPMB7N776WS,6303031323,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[9, 38]","Keith Gordon's film of Robert Cormier's &quot;The Chocolate War&quot; is in the long standing tradition of boys school movies like &quot;Another Country&quot; but minus the wit and sophistication.  In fact this is a movie that takes itself much too seriously especially as personified in the character of Archie as played by Wallace Langham (late of TV's Veronica's Web).  Archie is the brains of a society of thugs in sport coats called the Vigils.  The Vigils have gained power by intimidating their fellow students as well as the faculty.  They meet their match in the person of Jerry Renault (Ilan Mitchell-Smith)who refuses to participate in a school chocolate sale. It is never quite clear why he continues his chocolate boycott after following a Vigils edict to do so for 10 days.  Mitchell-Smith underplays most of his scenes and his face shows almost no emotion except when he is dreaming of his recently deceased mother and his now alcoholic father. John Glover lords over the school as Brother Leon who makes a pact with the Vigils to sell 20,000 boxes of chocolates so he can be promoted to head of the school.  The entire cast takes this all very seriously and we are force fed grand concepts like so many chocolate bon-bons shoved down our throats:  the individual vs the majority, brute force vs using your intellect, standing by your friends in times of conflict.  John Glover wins the BIG Ham award though, but it's a tough call with Wallace Langham coming in a close second.  If you must see a boys school film buy &quot;Another Country&quot; as the English do this thing a lot better than we Americans (ergo &quot;The Skulls&quot;).

351651,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,6303031323,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[3, 3]","There are many coming of age movies but this one is definitely unique.  Story is about all boys private school where many come from well off families and others are scholarship kids.  No matter which social background they come from, they all try to blend in and feel accepted by their peers.  It seems that most boys that crave popularity and accepatnace are members of the group called ""Vigils"".  Their leader is cunning and handsome young man, yet mean.  In a new year as freshman arrive, Vigils target most vulnerable one of the freshman for the membership where the acceptance is earned by rites of passage - surviving bulling by the other Vigils members.  In order to get accepted in this fraternity type of (false) brothehood, our main character pledges not to sell any of the 50 boxes of chocolates intended for a school fundraiser for 10 days.  When the pledge's 10 days elapse, everyone is stunned to learn that boxes continue not to sell by our young man who stubornly refuses to particiapte int he fundraiser sale.  His seeming vulnerability (his mother died) is turning into rebellion that is admirable by other boys who realize that conformity is not always path to acceptance, respect and admiration.  It is heartening to see how boys can be so hurtful to each other, but also wonderful to see that our hero does not waiver under pressure.  He stands his grounds and becomes moral winner.

351654,A2EY2RBD9C3ZIR,6303031323,The Seeker,"[1, 1]","Released in 1988, and directed by Keith Gordon, ""The Chocolate War"" is a very dark and depressing teen angst/coming-of-age film based on a novel of the same name by Robert Cormier. The movie stars Ilan Mitchell Smith, John Glover, Wallace Langham, Adam Gibson, and Doug Hutchison.The story is about a quiet, lonely, depressed, and passive 15-year old teenage boy named Jerry Renault. (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) Jerry is a loner who likes to daydream, and he hates confrontations. He goes to a strict Catholic day school for boys called Trinity.Jerry recently lost his mother due to cancer, and is living with his father - A local pharmacist.Jerry is a freshmen football player who you would think has many hopes and dreams like most 15-year old's, but sadly he does not. At such a young age, he finds himself becoming increasingly bored with his daily routine, and starts to think there's nothing in life worth living for. He notices that about his father too, and how every day is exactly the same with his Dad. This leads Jerry to worry about his future: Worries about there never being any change, and fears that for the rest of his life, everything will be exactly the same and nothing will get better.Meanwhile, within the school, there is a group....a secret society of bullies called ""The Vigils"". A mafia-like organization that has been around for decades. The members are seniors only who bully and intimidate their younger classmates into doing bizarre pranks to break the monotony of the day, and for the own personal amusement of the Vigils. One of the leaders of the group is a young man named Archie (Wallace Langham) - the mastermind who comes up with the pranks.....or ""assignments"" as the Vigils have always called it.Around the fall, there is a yearly chocolate sale. The boys are given fifty boxes of chocolates to sale. However, this year is a little different. The headmaster has become ill, and an eccentric teacher named Brother Leon (John Glover).....(who like the Vigils, enjoys bullying and humiliating his students, but in ways that are acceptable by the school's standards.).....has taken over the responsibilities of running the school's day-to-day activities.The school is having various financial issues, and Brother Leon hopes the chocolate sale will help pull them out of the ditch. He enlists the help of the Vigils to help get the school out of debt. However, after a disagreement between Brother Leon and the Vigils, the Vigils seek revenge, and recruit Jerry for an assignment. What starts off as a simple prank turns into World War 3.""The Chocolate War"" is not the type of film that some teachers would show their students because it's too dark. It is also *NOT* another inspirational and simple coming of-age story about a lone individual triumphing over an oppressive system. Instead, the film is a lot deeper than that....and a lot darker. It is about the horror of conformity and the deadening pointlessness of resistance.The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. The songs used are all beautiful, dark, and artsy. Many of the songs give me goosebumps. They completely sum up the film.I liked the film because I was bullied some in my youth, and was always told by some adults the same old clich&eacute; myth that if you stand up for yourself, the bully will go away. That may be true in some cases, but not always. Like Jerry, I stood up for myself plenty of times, but it only made things worst. In fact, often at times I was seen as being the villain all for having the nerve to verbally fight for my right to be the type of person I'd like to be, and defending that right to those who tried to impose their will on me. So I can relate to Jerry, and can also understand that fear of your life forever being the same.I saw the film before I read the book. I finally read the book a few years ago, and when I first asked the book store man about it, he thought it was a book written by Roald Dahl - The author who wrote ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". I suppose when you first read the title, you'd think it was some innocent school kid's book.
