628690,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00005JNC2,,"[3, 3]","Zach Braff (television'sScrubs) is without question an immense and versatile talent.  He directs, writes, and acts as the film's main protagonist in Garden State, a film with flashes of near brilliance.  He is no doubt worth looking out for and deserves quite a bit of credit.  However, Garden State should be judged as a film without taking that into account and although it does contain some genuinely sweet moments and some even better moments of natural humor, it just isn't consistent in how compelling it was for me.  I'm sure that experience will be different for everyone but to me it contains some very unlikely and unnatural moments.Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a quasi-actor and full fledge waiter who returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral.  He stops taking his medication (he was on zoloft, depakote, and lithium among many others) and begins to awaken a little bit.  He meets old friends and reflects on his family life before he left his hometown.  He then meets a new friend named Sam (Natalie Portman) who helps him realize what is really important to him.  Although clich&eacute;, the film's end is satisfying and I can't pinpoint why but I really didn't expect it from a character I didn't like very much in Largeman.I want to believe that Garden State is semi-biographical for Braff, and it probably is (I might write a movie where I fall in love with Natalie Portman too) but if there are scenes influenced by reality, then it seems very simple to see which ones are and which ones are completely exaggerated for the sake of comedic storytelling.  The other thing that troubled me about Garden State was how selfish every character is.  It makes it very difficult to care about characters that you wouldn't have any respect for in real life.  The only exception to this Portman's Sam who is very likeable and quirky but is probably the only character that isn't based on some degree of reality.  I don't see any real serious undertones in Garden State or any real commentary beyond reflecting some aspect of real life.  It failed to do that for me and that's probably why it comes off as pretentious.  In some ways it really is only a few steps above pure teenage comedies because it wants to be adult so bad at times and maybe that is a strength for some people, but to me the way it masks its comedic goals with unconvincing drama is almost unforgivable.Garden State is in the frame of a very good movie and for the most part I didn't think it was as bad as I'm detailing here, I think I just couldn't identify with it.  Performances from Portman, Braff, Ian Holm, Peter Saargard and others are genuine, at times amusing, and overall pretty solid.  The actors do struggle at times with the more ostentatious and less believable dialogue. Portman is especially enjoyable to watch but you really wonder how long she can be the potentially great actress everyone has been waiting for.  Despite what some people may suggest, this movie is not the vehicle for Portman's career defining star moment, which may or may not ever come.  She probably doesn't care though and is fine slumming it in quirky little films like this that have very little to say.  Anyway, it is worth watching if you like the talent in this movie.  It shows some budding talent from Braff and some solid actors at work. It also happens to have a smart sense of humor that I suppose I appreciated.  Thesoundtrackwas great but also felt pretty consistent with Braff's hipster-wannabe motif.  Either way, I'll keep an eye out for his next movie.",2,Stunted Coming of Age Story that is Inconsistently Natural,1196899200,"12 6, 2007",2007,3545,"['Zach', 'Braff', ""television'sScrubs"", 'question', 'immense', 'versatile', 'talent', 'film', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Garden', 'State', 'film', 'flashes', 'near', 'brilliance', 'doubt', 'looking', 'out', 'quite', 'bit', 'credit', 'However', 'Garden', 'State', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'film', 'taking', 'account', 'contain', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'moments', 'even', 'better', 'moments', 'natural', 'humor', 'just', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'how', 'compelling', 'was', ""'m"", 'sure', 'experience', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'everyone', 'very', 'unlikely', 'unnatural', 'moments.Andrew', 'Largeman', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'quasi-actor', 'full', 'fledge', 'waiter', 'who', 'hometown', 'mother', 'funeral', 'taking', 'medication', 'was', 'zoloft', 'depakote', 'lithium', 'many', 'others', 'awaken', 'little', 'bit', 'old', 'friends', 'family', 'life', 'left', 'hometown', 'then', 'new', 'friend', 'named', 'Sam', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'realize', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'end', 'satisfying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pinpoint', 'why', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'much', 'Largeman.I', 'want', 'believe', 'Garden', 'State', 'semi-biographical', 'Braff', 'probably', 'might', 'write', 'movie', 'where', 'fall', 'love', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'too', 'are', 'scenes', 'influenced', 'reality', 'then', 'very', 'simple', 'see', 'ones', 'are', 'ones', 'are', 'completely', 'exaggerated', 'sake', 'comedic', 'storytelling', 'other', 'thing', 'troubled', 'Garden', 'State', 'was', 'how', 'selfish', 'character', 'very', 'difficult', 'care', 'characters', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'respect', 'real', 'life', 'only', 'exception', 'Portman', 'Sam', 'who', 'very', 'likeable', 'quirky', 'probably', 'only', 'character', ""n't"", 'based', 'degree', 'reality', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'real', 'serious', 'undertones', 'Garden', 'State', 'real', 'commentary', 'reflecting', 'aspect', 'real', 'life', 'failed', 'do', 'probably', 'why', 'off', 'pretentious', 'ways', 'really', 'only', 'few', 'steps', 'pure', 'teenage', 'comedies', 'be', 'adult', 'so', 'bad', 'times', 'maybe', 'strength', 'people', 'way', 'comedic', 'goals', 'unconvincing', 'drama', 'almost', 'unforgivable.Garden', 'State', 'frame', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'as', 'bad', ""'m"", 'detailing', 'here', 'think', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'identify', 'Performances', 'Portman', 'Braff', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Peter', 'Saargard', 'others', 'are', 'genuine', 'times', 'amusing', 'overall', 'pretty', 'solid', 'actors', 'do', 'struggle', 'times', 'more', 'ostentatious', 'less', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'Portman', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'really', 'wonder', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'be', 'potentially', 'great', 'actress', 'everyone', 'been', 'waiting', 'what', 'people', 'may', 'suggest', 'movie', 'not', 'vehicle', 'Portman', 'career', 'defining', 'star', 'moment', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'ever', 'come', 'probably', ""n't"", 'care', 'fine', 'slumming', 'quirky', 'little', 'films', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'say', 'Anyway', 'worth', 'watching', 'like', 'talent', 'movie', 'budding', 'talent', 'Braff', 'solid', 'actors', 'work', 'also', 'have', 'smart', 'sense', 'humor', 'suppose', 'appreciated', 'Thesoundtrackwas', 'great', 'also', 'felt', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'Braff', 'hipster-wannabe', 'motif', 'way', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'next', 'movie']",Garden State
628691,ARHUBLVXF8PGF,B00005JNC2,Aaa,"[26, 44]","And ""Garden State"" will. If you can listen to the music they feature in most Starbucks outlets without wanting desperately to find the nearest scimitar and give yourself a full van Gogh, then this is your movie. (Me, I hear a few minor chords on an acoustic and a Dan Fogelberg wannabe on the vocals, and I'm out the front door before you can say ""double latte extra venti mocha skim decaf"".) The annoying Zach Braff stars in and also directs this way-too-edgy coming-of-age depressicom, and he throws in so much gratuitous homage to ""The Graduate""---including a silly pool scene, a mom-teenager affair a la Mrs. Robinson, a couple of surreal airport visits, and--what's this?-- a floppy-haired, quirky protagonist suffering from alienation and emoting all over the place---that when you finally hear an actual Simon-Garfunkel tune (""The Only Living Boy In New York"") about three-quarters through the film it sounds as natural as Teddy Kennedy screaming at a slow bartender.Unlike Dustin Hoffman's Ben Braddock, who was an outsider by temperament, the character played by Braff, Andrew Largeman (get it? not sure I do) has some very legit reasons for his inability to connect. I won't give away the plot secrets here, but if you go out for popcorn at exactly the wrong minute, none of this movie will ever make any sense. On the other hand, there probably is no wrong moment in this movie to go out for popcorn or even for a two day business trip. Anyhow, because of some really really bad stuff that happened a long time ago (involving a very young Andrew and his mother, OK? Don't ask, really), Largeman is estranged from his psychiatrist father, and only comes home from Los Angeles to the eponymous eastern seaboard locale in order to attend said mother's funeral. Back in Jersey, he meets up with some of his quirky stay-at-home high school chums, including the oily Peter Sarsgaard as a cemetery worker with some very strange hobbies not limited to filching jewelry from cadavers.A meet-cute encounter at the neurologist's office with the quirky Sam (Natalie Portman, with Spock ears intact, a bit of Naboo still in her eyes, and a sign on her forehead reading ""I'm seriously nuts"") introduces Andrew to the kind of family he wishes he had--warm, loving, lots of hugs, adopted African student (making ""Garden State"" the second movie in very recent memory-- the initially promising but ultimately disappointing ""I Heart Huckabees"" is the other---to establish a family's big heartedness by plunking an African adoptee into the middle of the love-filled zaniness). In Sam, Andrew's finally found the kind of girl who's bound to change his life forever if only he'll let her inside the walled garden (get the double-entendre of the title?) of his soul. Lots of fun follows as Andrew introduces Sam to his shifty pals, but before you know it, Andrew's four-day visit is over, and he has to head back to LA to resume his movie ""career"". But first things first: a rapprochement of sorts with the icy Dr. Dad, a crying scene with Sam, and, of course, the obligatory self-discovery trip to a major geological find in the center of Newark right on the site where some crass capitalists were about to build a mall before they were foiled by the, uh, quirky urban homesteader whose sense of purpose opens Andrew's heart.I think this movie won some kind of big award at The Sundance Festival.

Rather true too.I thought I read where this was Braff's THX1138 (aka college idea). Hope there is more coming. Scrubs was very good and now over.

628698,A3J3Y7OPDDYKH2,B00005JNC2,"Alane M. Downes ""downfall4""","[4, 5]","Zach Braff's directorial debut has similarities to the groundbreaking, timeless film ""The Graduate"".  Like Benjamin Braddock, Zach Braff's character, Andrew Largeman, is numb and uncertain as to where the future will lead him.  Zach's prescription drug dependency (for whom his father, a psychiatrist played by Ian Holm, is responsible) is symbolic of a numb existence and a lack of direction, similar to the scene of Benjamin Braddock floating in scuba gear in his swimming pool.  Largeman's encounter with Sam, portrayed by Natalie Portman, is reminiscent of Benjamin's relationship with Elaine. There is an almost immediate sense that these two are soulmates - that they can laugh together and cry together.  There are some tender, sensitive scenes such as when Andrew and Sam bury her hamster, ""Jelly"", and when Andrew and Sam sit in the empty bathtub together talking.  There are, however, some moments in the movie that made me cringe, mostly because our kids are usually watching most of the movies that we watch, or the parts that we allow them to, anyway. Maybe I'm not a fan of realism when it comes to male dogs...or voyeurism. In my opinion, these parts do nothing to enhance the film, and should have been removed or edited, and that's why I give the movie 4 out of 5 stars.The swear words could be toned down a bit, but much like other movies of 20-something characters (such as ""Good Will Hunting""), the language is to some degree necessary. I especially loved the scene where the three main characters (Peter Sarsgaard is the third main character) visit  a couple and their baby in an old ark-like boat located next to a natural wonder, a very deep chasm. The rain is pouring outside. Inside the landlocked boat,it's  cozy, warm and dry.  The couple share their feelings about making a mark in life being less important than being wholely and deeply in love.  As they leave, Andrew wishes the father good luck in exploring ""the infinite abyss"".  He calls back to Andrew, ""You, too!"", conveying that Andrew is in the process of discovering his own true nature and path in life.  The three main characters leave the peaceful comfort of the ark and stand at the top of the chasm in the rain yelling to create echoes and release all their tension and anxiety. When Andrew impulsively kisses Sam, it seems moving,real and tender - one of the few truly romantic screen moments that you want to relive over and over - and I did! This entire scene is perfect.  The music helped create the mood.  Simon and Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" seemed perfect for the three characters dressed in garbage bags wandering around the chasm amidst the bulldozers. Now I have this scene from the movie etched in my mind when I listen to this song over and over! The movie's quirkiness - almost surreal or fairytale-like - is reminiscent as well of ""Harold and Maude"", another favorite of mine.

Andrew is a Hollywood actor who returns to his home state, New Jersey for his mother's funeral.  As droning as his life seems to be, Andrew catches up with some old time friends while avoiding his father, who is a psychiatrist.  In fact, he is Andrew's psychiatrist, who prescribes pills that are suppose to make Andrew feel happy.  Blinded by his own vision of a ""happy family,"" Andrew's father is unable to control Andrew's ""happiness"" for a few days, as Andrew forgot his medication in LA.  This created an opening to Andrew's eyes and mind.  This small breach leaked out light to Andrew's gray character.  Opening that door was Sam (Natalie Portman), a young refreshing color Andrew needed added to his life that even his ecstasy couldn't offer.During his short-planned stay in NJ, Andrew learns that life is not all that bad.  All his feelings that were bottled up from his youthful past finally spilled out before him and to people he loved.  Although the movie seems to insert random events and scenes, one can quickly relate easily that many of life's events are nothing but random.It is worthwhile to see how Sam and Andrew help each other out healing each other, and learning life's most important purpose--just to live it.  This movie was worth its time and I'd recommend this film to anyone, especially those who are seeking a possible meaning to Life.

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[2, 2]","'Garden State' is a movie that I was recommended to by my mom (lol) for several months now and up until tonight I avoided whatching it-I just didn't want to because she tends to go for sad films about alienation and despair but I watched this all the way through and you know what I think?I really don't know-Zach Braff stars and directs this almost charming film about an actor who has numbed his mind in various ways to block out some a tragic point in his life.THEN his mother is killed in an accident and he has to go back home to confront his the loss and his past.In the beginning this character and his (whom I feel) depraved friends are very hopeless.Then comes the girl (Natile Portman) into his life-she's,yes just a little left of center but unlike him has no difficulty with emotional expression.For example she and her family have a bad history with pets AND because of her epilepsy is forced to where a helmet to work everyday.Well as the relationship grows Braff finds himself beginning to deal with himself and touch on his repressed feelings.In the end he does and the pair both find comfort in eachother.The movie has some dull streches and can be a little slow but the general theme is numbness and as the leading man's emotional 'numbness' regresses the pace of the film quickens.In the beginning 'Garden State' comes off as a highly depressing dark comedy to me and by the end there is some emotional release.It's definately worth seeing once for sure because it deals with how human beings can put repress their true heart on a dime if it suits them.But 'Garden State' is also one of those films of which your opinion of it will depend highly on your mood.As for me personally I watched the movie in a rather depressed and lonely state of mind.The feelings it engendered weren't exactly negative but the comedy of the film largly escaped me at times.I knew the jokes were there but they really didn't hit me.Basically I kept sympathising alot with Braff's character-he seemed to be a decent human being in all the wrong situations until he met the right person for him.Watch 'Garden State' alone or with a family member-it's not exactly a fun,popcorn movie to have on with a bunch of friends because parts of it are a downer and the sudtle comedy often borders on the morbid.Themes of death,endings and alienation are a recurrent theme throughout-it's not a angst film at all but it's more of a mature kind of sadness.But sadness nevertheless.So watch this and follow it with something more comedic-this film needs a stress reliver afterwards.",5,A Tale Of Two People,1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,2565,"[""'Garden"", 'State', 'movie', 'was', 'recommended', 'mom', 'lol', 'several', 'months', 'now', 'up', 'tonight',

628704,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JNC2,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Continuing on in my `all things Sarsgaard' I'm actually getting to one of his greatest performances; yet sadly it is not in one of his better films.Coming off as more of a gimmick than anything substantial, `Garden State' is one of those cult films with very rabid and devoted fans as well as very cruel and hatful detractors.  I am one on the fence.  I enjoy the film, and I remember when it came out I actually loved it and found it an amalgam of jovial fun; but as the years have gone by my adoration for the film has melted away to uncover a mere toleration of it.  It remains one of those clever films that, over time, proves itself less clever and more pretentious and even superficial.The film follows an actor who is distanced from his former life only to get thrust back in when his mother dies.  Nine years removed from all he used to know he is know stuck in a town he wants to forget, with an angry father and aimless friends and an intriguing girl who holds the key to release his inner contentment.I really like Zach Braff as an actor.  In fact, even here I really like him.  In fact, to be honest, the acting in this film is rather remarkable from all parties.  The thing is, Zach doesn't understand how to make a complete story.  He was so focused on creating a visually appealing film complete with `hip' music and clever tricks that he lost focus on creating a moving STORY.  It is generic and serviceable, but it becomes overwhelmed by the visual impact of the film.  I do wholly believe that some of the best films are built around beautifully constructed sequences of memorable events, even if those events are mere images that burrow themselves in our mind and keep us in rapt attention, but where `Garden State' fails to live up is in the area of cementing those `sequences' with heartfelt purpose.The film winds up becoming forgettable.  I remember the pool sequence (a sublime example of `beautifully constructed sequences') but I don't know why (thus proving that it wasn't a `memorable event').Like I said, the acting is sublime.  Natalie Portman was nominated for an Oscar this year for her work in `Closer'.  Both her performances are vastly different and both are career highlights for her.  She is stunning here as the hyper Sam, an intriguing character with flaws and demons of her own.  To me though, this film belongs to Sarsgaard, who just shimmers in all sorts of glory as the aimlessly charismatic Mark.  He steals every scene he is in and just proves that a great performance can help carry a rather shallow film.  When you couple this with his breathtaking work in `Kinsey' it becomes clear that Sarsgaard was the man in 2004.How Oscar eludes him still is baffling to me.So, I can understand the draw for this film, but I strongly feel that the love for it is blind.  It is visually compelling, and the acting is stellar, and that soundtrack is very, very likable; but the lack of substance becomes apparent ones the glossy veneer fades away and we are left with only half the movie we vaguely remember enjoying.",3,A shockingly forgettable state of mind...,1257292800,"11 4, 2009",2009,3051,"['Continuing', 'things', 'Sarsgaard', ""'m"", 'actually', 'getting', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'yet', 'sadly', 'not', 'one', 'better', 'films.Coming', 'off', 'more', 'gimmick', 'anything', 'substantial', 'Garden', 'State', 'one', 'cult', 'films', 'very', 'rabid', 'devoted', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'cruel', 'hatful', 'detractors', 'am', 'one', 'fence', 'enjoy', 'film', 'remember', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'actually', 'loved', 'found', 'amalgam', 'jovial', 'fun', 'years', 'have', 'gone', 'adoration', 'film', 'melted', 'away', 'uncover', 'mere', 'toleration', 'one', 'clever', 'films', 'time', 'less', 'clever', 'more', 'pretentious', 'even', 'superficial.The', 'film', 'actor', 'who', 'distanced', 'former', 'life', 'only', 'get', 'thrust', 'back', 'when', 'mother', 'dies', 'Nine', 'years', 'removed', 'all', 'used', 'know', 'know', 'stuck', 'town', 'forget', 'angry', 'father', 'aimless', 'friends', 'intriguing', 'girl', 'who', 'key', 'release', 'inner', 'contentment.I', 'really', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'actor', 'fact', 'even', 'here', 'really', 'fact', 'be', 'honest', 'acting', 'film', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'parties', 'thing', 'Zach', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'make', 'complete', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'focused', 'creating', 'visually', 'appealing', 'film', 'complete', 'hip', 'music', 'clever', 'tricks', 'lost', 'focus', 'creating', 'moving', 'STORY', 'generic', 'serviceable', 'overwhelmed', 'visual', 'impact', 'film', 'do', 'wholly', 'believe', 'best', 'films', 'are', 'built', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'sequences', 'memorable', 'events', 'even', 'events', 'are', 'mere', 'images', 'burrow', 'mind', 'keep', 'rapt', 'attention', 'where', 'Garden', 'State', 'fails', 'live', 'up', 'area', 'cementing', 'sequences', 'purpose.The', 'film', 'up', 'becoming', 'forgettable', 'remember', 'pool', 'sequence', 'sublime', 'example', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'sequences', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'thus', 'proving', 'was', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'event', 'said', 'acting', 'sublime', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'year', 'work', 'Closer', 'performances', 'are', 'vastly', 'different', 'are', 'career', 'highlights', 'stunning', 'here', 'hyper', 'Sam', 'intriguing', 'character', 'flaws', 'demons', 'own', 'film', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'just', 'shimmers', 'sorts', 'glory', 'aimlessly', 'charismatic', 'Mark', 'scene', 'just', 'proves', 'great', 'performance', 'can', 'help', 'carry', 'rather', 'shallow', 'film', 'When', 'couple', 'breathtaking', 'work', 'Kinsey', 'clear', 'Sarsgaard', 'was', 'man', '2004.How', 'Oscar', 'eludes', 'still', 'baffling', 'me.So', 'can', 'understand', 'draw', 'film', 'strongly', 'feel', 'love', 'blind', 'visually', 'compelling', 'acting', 'stellar', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'very', 'likable', 'lack', 'substance', 'becomes', 'apparent', 'ones', 'glossy', 'veneer', 'away', 'are', 'left', 'only', 'movie', 'vaguely', 'remember', 'enjoying']",Garden State

Of course, as with anything that has people's opinions, not everyone will like it.I've read many reviews of the film, that were clearly written by older folks who were looking for something other than what the film is about.  Some complain that the story between Andrew and his father only plays a minor role- this makes me think, did they miss the whole point of this movie? It's not about father-son relationships, it's not even about a love interest.  The film, IMO, is about the feeling of being lost and having no direction, looking for a way to find home.The protagonist is Andrew Largeman, a overly medicated 20 something year old, who lives a life of aimlessly going from day to day.  You know, kind of like when your days just start blurring between each other, because it's the same old routine.  Many of us have felt that, especially after we are done with college and try to find a job we'll like.  We usually start on jobs that are so mindlessly boring, that we just go through the motions day, after day.Andrew's life is about to change though, as he gets news of the death of his mother, prompting his return to New Jersey.  He returns home and has awkward interactions with his family, especially his father.  This made sense to me, since my relationship with my own father is awkward, so much so that I really can't talk to him except to say hello and a few small words of small talk; imagine how weird it felt for Largeman, who harbors a reasonable hate for his father, which will be further explained as the movie goes on.Many will dimiss the rest of the movie as a aimless jump from one scene to another, but then, they are also missing the point.  It serves to remember, for those of you who've gone away to college to come back 4 years later.........how weird it felt, and how out of place one feels as one tries to reconnect with old friends; how we wander around, going from one friend's house to the next.The love story itself is not so much real, but more of a wish.  Every 20 something has the dream of meeting that special someone; she's interesting, she's funny, she's beautiful, and she makes the first move by talking to us.  Yes, it's our fantasy that gets played out in this film, and many older folks will fail to see it, and just think of it as a cop-out when it gets to fruition in the end.In the end, I don't think many people over the age of 30 will ultimately enjoy this film as much as someone younger, mostly because they most likely already have their lives together.  For many 20 somethings, we are still looking for our own family and home, as the moving quote from the movies goes ""maybe family is just a bunch of people who miss the same imaginary place.""It helps to think back to the feeling you get, after you finish college and come ""home.""  Something doesn't feel right, you can't really place your finger on it, but even though you still love your parents, their home is no longer your home.  Your parent's home is not what you imagine your home is anymore, but rather, you beging to imagine a home of your own, with another person who imagines the same home you do.",5,A film that will not speak to everyone.....,1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,3171,"['speak', 'many', '20', 'something', 'year', 'olds', 'course', 'anything', 'people', 'opinions', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'it.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'film', 'were', 'clearly', 'written', 'older', 'folks', 'who', 'were', 'looking', 'something', 'other', 'what', 'film', 'complain', 'story', 'Andrew', 'father', 'only', 'minor', 'role-', 'think', 'did', 'miss', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'not', 'father-son', 'relationships', 'not', 'even', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'IMO', 'feeling', 'being', 'lost', 'having', 'direction', 'looking', 'way', 'find', 'home.The', 'protagonist', 'Andrew', 'Largeman', 'overly', 'medicated', '20', 'something', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'life', 'aimlessly', 'going', 'day', 'day', 'know', 'kind', 'when', 'days', 'just', 'start', 'blurring', 'other', 'same', 'old', 'routine', 'Many', 'have', 'felt', 'especially', 'are', 'done', 'college', 'try', 'find', 'job', ""'ll"", 'like', 'usually', 'start', 'jobs', 'are', 'so', 'mindlessly', 'boring', 'just', 'go', 'motions', 'day', 'day.Andrew', 'life', 'change', 'though', 'news', 'death', 'mother', 'prompting', 'return', 'New', 'Jersey', 'home', 'awkward', 'interactions', 'family', 'especially', 'father', 'made', 'sense', 'relationship', 'own', 'father', 'awkward', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'say', 'hello', 'few', 'small', 'words', 'small', 'talk', 'imagine', 'how', 'weird', 'felt', 'Largeman', 'who', 'reasonable', 'hate', 'father', 'will', 'be', 'further', 'explained', 'movie', 'on.Many', 'will', 'dimiss', 'rest', 'movie', 'aimless', 'jump', 'one', 'scene', 'then', 'are', 'also', 'missing', 'point', 'remember', 'who', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'away', 'college', 'come', 'back', '4', 'years', 'later', 'how', 'weird', 'felt', 'how', 'place', 'one', 'feels', 'one', 'reconnect', 'old', 'friends', 'how', 'wander', 'around', 'going', 'one', 'friend', 'house', 'next.The', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'real', 'more', 'wish', '20', 'something', 'dream', 'meeting', 'special', 'someone', 'interesting', 'funny', 'beautiful', 'first', 'move', 'talking', 'Yes', 'fantasy', 'played', 'out', 'film', 'many', 'older', 'folks', 'will', 'fail', 'see', 'just', 'think', 'cop-out', 'when', 'fruition', 'end.In', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'people', 'age', '30', 'will', 'ultimately', 'enjoy', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'someone', 'younger', 'mostly', 'most', 'likely', 'already', 'have', 'lives', 'together', 'many', '20', 'somethings', 'are', 'still', 'looking', 'own', 'family', 'home', 'moving', 'quote', 'movies', 'maybe', 'family', 'just', 'bunch', 'people', 'who', 'miss', 'same', 'imaginary', 'place', 'think', 'back', 'feeling', 'get', 'finish', 'college', 'come', 'home', 'Something', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'place', 'finger', 'even', 'still', 'love', 'parents', 'home', 'no', 'longer', 'home', 'parent', 'home', 'not', 'what', 'imagine', 'home', 'anymore', 'rather', 'beging', 'imagine', 'home', 'own', 'person', 'who', 'same', 'home', 'do']",Garden State

628712,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00005JNC2,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[2, 3]","It seems that every few years, somebody has to make an independent, critically acclaimed version of that classic, Dante's Inferno.  Usually I lose interest once I realize where the plot is coming from, but Garden State kept me watching through a mixture of fascination with Zach Braff's soft inscrutability and a clever mixing-up of the story elements.  This is one ""Inferno"" that took me by surprise.Zach Braff  both masterminded and starred in this film about a twentysomething guy trying to find himself on a visit home to lay his mother to rest.  Through a combination of ceaseless drug ""therapy"" and emotional alienation from his family, Andrew has been numb for years and can't even seem to summon up tears at the funeral.  He meets up with some old school friends and tries to console himself with the same old-same old toxic remedies of loveless sex and altered states, but somehow they have lost their effectiveness and leave him hungrier than before for something meaningful. Even worse are the series of characters that Andrew encounters throughout his home town; each one is living some kind of illusion to the point of becoming caricatures of real people. Then he finds Sam (Natalie Portman), the first person in his life who has no self-delusions.  Sam is openly flawed, funny and compassionate.  She challenges him to look for truth in everything, even his pain.  It is a turning point that leads to important revelations.I loved the way this film was written and paced so that Andrew's feelings of being lost and confused are infectious to me, the audience, yet it never becomes morose or dark.  This same slowness did work against it at times, but there are also some genuinely funny moments and some genuinely touching scenes. It did seem to lack a little in the way of intensity when Braff makes his self-discoveries ( I was left wondering if there wasn't more to his weirdness than the mundane reason behind all his pain). Overall though, Garden State was a well-acted and well-crafted offering for the cult-classic-to-be crowd.  Besides - who *doesn't* like Natalie Portman???Garden State is sure to satisfy when you are looking for something more than a summer blockbuster clich&eacute;.

From the initial meeting of Portman and Braff up to the very last scene, every moment is authentic and true.  One cannot help cheering for them both.For a director, Braff's acting is quite good but few actresses are capable of putting forth a performance like Natalie Portman.  In fact, I can't think of any. She is utterly amazing and by far the most compelling character in the movie. Portman is an idealization of the pleasant, playful, penetrating coquette we've all read about but rarely meet.  Frankly, it's a joy to have  her on the screen.  I read online that Portman's father was a fertility specialist--I should say so! I don't know how any man could resist her, particularly in this alluring role.Garden State is a movie about love, friendship, life, and family and its effect is total gratification.  I'll go out on a limb here and say that this one's now lodged into my lifetime Top 10.  I'm shocked the cumulative rating is only four stars as I'd give it a 9.5 on a ten point scale.

Little things have stayed with me about GS, including the powerful soundtrack.  My particular preference is to have the music lift the emotion to a place the visual couldn't have reached on its own - definitely the case here.  I heard Zach Braff won an award for the sound track - and he doesn't play any music!  Well, now I know why.Natalie Portman was born to play the female lead.  The humor was fantastic, and I understand, alot of the material was autobiographical.  But theres plenty of morbidity here too. One of the main characters takes jewelry from corpses as he's burying them, and took jewelry off of the mother of the main character!  Somehow, this is all forgiven, given the otherwise sincerely of the script.  Braff does a nice job of avoiding the tendency to fill every void with dialogue.The point, I think, is that most people are wasting their lives away unhappy, bored, or alone.  The two main characters seemingly, avoid this fate, recognizing the potential contained in their new love.I could go on with insights, but basically I was hooked as soon as I saw the torn off gas nozzle sticking out of Braff's gas tank at the beginning.

I was expecting it to be fairly awful because I had never heard of it and the cover makes it look extra cheesy. I was wrong about that.Within afew minutes I was totally into it.

He is the only one not panicing and grabbing the oxygen masks because the plane looks to be about to crash.From then on its a few days in the life of Largeman (JD from Scrubs). Good and bad things happen to Largeman but he's not really bothered one way or another. The good include meeting up with old friends and meeting Natalie Portman. The bad include his mum dying, and a dog humping his leg (or maybe that was a good thing). It's one of those films that will either bore you to death, or you will enjoy every moment. It might annoy you, it might not. Best to just watch it with an open mind. There are plenty of comedy moments as well as sad ones. The soundtrack is excellent (if you like Chillout music like Zero 7) and there are plenty of slow motion effects (to music). These are balanced out pretty well and not over-done or too cheesy. There are plenty of weird characters for JD to meet along the way such as the nerdiest Knight of the round table ever, the stupidest cop ever, the least successful pet owners ever, the worst funeral singer ever, the friendliest guide dog ever, the doctor with the most certificates ever, and many more.All in all Garden State is a nice chillout film that is like eating a bowl of Ready Brek.

Who cares if it was made on a lower budget or wasn't released with the same publication and funding that the newest Spielberg movie got. If the movie is good, then it's good.This movie was great! It's a very paced, clever, funny and emotional experience. I'm sure you know the plot, but here it is: A kid returns home after hearing that his mother has died. Upon returning, he must deal with the relationships he left behind, lots of unfinished business and his own personal demons. There it is, pretty simple right? Well, yeah, it is simple. But the storytelling itself is what drives this movie.The kid returns to find his friends all stuck in similar ruts, or extraordinary ones for that matter. His connections with them are very ture. I am serving in the military and when I go home to see my family and friends, it is almost exactly as akward and uncomfortable as this movie paints it.The gorgeous Natalie Portman joins in after a little while and the story really takes off. I'm not going to give away any spoilers because that would make the film less enjoyable. I'll just say that my favorite parts were the Mideval Times, and the bow and arrow scenes.

Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff), along with millions of American twentysomethings, has reached that point. He has returned home to New Jersey for the first time in nine years for his mother's funeral, except all he's found is the house he used to live in; no home in sight.In L.A., he is a Z-list actor, obscurely known to some as a mentally-challenged quarterback in a bad TV movie. Listless is an understatement of Andrew's sedated life. That is, until he meets a young lady named Sam (Natalie Portman), who at first seems his opposite, what with her outgoing nature and tendency to lie for no reason, but as we get to know them better, we find out that they want the same things.Throughout the film, Andrew runs into people who may have been his friends years ago, but are now just people that he used to know. Most notably among these is Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), a grave digger with big plans, but no ambition to carry them out. In fact, it seems like a lot of Andrew's old acquaintances are exactly the same way - and he's not much better. Meanwhile, Andrew's father (Ian Holm) wonders what happened to the happy son he had, but Andrew wonders where his father got the idea that he was happy once.First-time writer-director Zach Braff has crafted an excellent film that I think perfectly captures the feelings of restless youth. Nothing can be done fast enough for us. Can't wait to get out of the house. Can't wait to be rich and famous. We want to be Large Men. Except while we're doing all this rushing around, we cut ourselves off from the lives we could be living, and turn around nine years later and wonder what happened to the life we thought we'd have.The performances, in my opinion, are brilliant, in that they are subtly nuanced. They take what in a lesser movie would be stereotypical characters and turn them into real live people that you might know. You may have even had some of the same conversations that they have. I think that in 20 years, we may look back on this film when we want to remember what we were thinking in 2004.Braff has a bright future ahead of him if he continues to make films. He is able to shift between comedy and poignancy at the drop of a dime, and doesn't cheat to get the desired effect.

I often talk about films with simple but altogether moving stories, like The Breakfast Club and Adventureland. This more than falls into that category. This is one of the finest first features from any director since Sam Mendes' American Beauty. I know that's saying alot, but Braff lives up to it. It's nothing less than a stroke of genius when a filmmaker so clearly defines himself with only one picture under his belt.The film centers around the homecoming of Andrew Largeman, a second-rate Hollywood actor who's been over-medicated by his psychiatrist father since his pre-teen years when he was blamed for the crippling of his mother. Now his mother had died, and Andrew is coming back to Jersey for the first time in 9 years. He encounters high school friends, many of them trying to mooch off his ""status"" back in Hollywood(possibly a commentary on Braff's own personal life being a well known actor), but he also meet a few worthwhile people, one of them being Sam, a quirkier-than-thou girl(but one with a true soul that's uncovered not-too-late in the film) who seems to be the first person in Andrew's life that tries to dig deep into him to find his true spirit. She is MUCH more than a ""love interest"".This film is truly about renewed life; Andrew gets rid of the drugs that has paralyzed his mind in the same way his mother's body was, he breathes true air for the first time, and finds that life might actually be worth living.

Made for a paltry (by Hollywood standards) $2.5 million, it has gone on to gross over ten times its budget and, more importantly, become the defining film for a generation of young, disaffected people who clearly identify with this personal movie and its fascinating characters.There is an audio commentary by Braff and Portman that is quite engaging and personable. Not surprisingly, Braff dominates while Portman gamely asks him many questions to keep things going.There is a second audio commentary featuring Braff, director of photography Lawrence Sher, editor Myron Kerstein and production designer Judy Becker. With his dry wit, Braff MCs this track as the participants talk about the more technical aspects of the movie.Also included are 16 deleted scenes with optional commentary by all the participants from the second commentary. Braff puts the footage in its context and talks about why they were cut (for time).""The Making of Garden State"" examines how Braff put his movie together. There is quite a bit of decent behind-the-scenes footage and plenty of interview soundbites from the cast and crew. For a Making Of featurette it is refreshingly free of an excess of clips from the movie that always pad out the running time of these things.There is also a fairly amusing collection of blown lines and bloopers.Finally, there is a promo for the film's soundtrack.Garden State is a film bursting with ideas, keen observations on life and memorable images that make most other films look inert by comparison. There is a tendency for first-time filmmakers to throw everything into the mix on their debut because they aren't sure if the film will succeed and they'll get a second chance.

Natalie Portman definitely earns her paycheck as Sam, a charmingly weird girl who manages to love life (and inspire a love of life in others) even as she deals with problems that would send most of us into a tailspin of self pity. Writer Zach Braff of NBC's Scrubs was equally great as director and actor, playing the part of a young man named Andrew Largeman, who has returned to New Jersey after nine years of living in California, where he has won moderate fame on a TV series playing an intellectually-stunted individual. (A left-handed compliment in the movie has someone telling Andrew, ""On that show I really thought you WERE retarded."") Andrew returns to his hometown to attend the funeral of his mother, whom he accidentally crippled when he was a child: something he has clearly never been allowed to forget, and which has understandably haunted him ever since. In New Jersey Andrew reconnects with a number of old friends, including one whose sudden wealth comes from having invented a form of ""silent Velcro"" and he stares down some old demons, including the biggest one in the form of his judgmental father. Above all else Andrew unexpectedly finds love, and it is the story of this love that gives (the almost dreary) Garden State its well-found balance. Garden State is a refreshing movie that never loses the feel of its indie roots. Andrew and Sam are the sort of people it's impossible not to root for, and the entire film has a ""what will happen next"" feel that's rarer than ever for any writer to accomplish.",4,A Cool Flick,1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,1838,"['surprising', 'winner', 'book', 'Garden', 'State', 'entirely', 'likable', 'also', 'one', 'films', 'capable', 'being', 'simultaneously', 'deep', 'funny', 'light', 'fun', 'welcoming', 'imposing', 'out', 'misguiding', 'exterior', 'brutally', 'confides', 'things', ""'d"", 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'not', 'know', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'definitely', 'paycheck', 'Sam', 'charmingly', 'weird', 'girl', 'who', 'love', 'life', 'inspire', 'love', 'life', 'others', 'even', 'problems', 'would', 'send', 'most', 'tailspin', 'self', 'pity', 'Writer', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'NBC', 'Scrubs', 'was', 'equally', 'great', 'director', 'actor', 'playing', 'part', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Andrew', 'Largeman', 'who', 'returned', 'New', 'Jersey', 'nine', 'years', 'living', 'California', 'where', 'won', 'moderate', 'fame', 'TV', 'series', 'playing', 'intellectually-stunted', 'individual', 'left-handed', 'compliment', 'movie', 'someone', 'telling', 'Andrew', 'show', 'really', 'thought', 'WERE', 'retarded', 'Andrew', 'hometown', 'attend', 'funeral', 'mother', 'whom', 'accidentally', 'crippled', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'something', 'clearly', 'never', 'been', 'allowed', 'forget', 'understandably', 'haunted', 'ever', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Andrew', 'number', 'old', 'friends', 'including', 'one', 'sudden', 'wealth', 'having', 'invented', 'form', 'silent', 'Velcro', 'down', 'old', 'demons', 'including', 'biggest', 'one', 'form', 'judgmental', 'father', 'else', 'Andrew', 'unexpectedly', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'almost', 'dreary', 'Garden', 'State', 'well-found', 'balance', 'Garden', 'State', 'refreshing', 'movie', 'never', 'feel', 'indie', 'roots', 'Andrew', 'Sam', 'are', 'sort', 'people', 'impossible', 'not', 'root', 'entire', 'film', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'feel', 'rarer', 'ever', 'writer', 'accomplish']",Garden State

To be honest, I did not think I was going to like it and the first five minutes of the film seemed to confirm it.  I found his character dull and uninteresting.  But as the movie developed and the character's dullness was revealed to be an extension of his sedated state (both emotionally and physically), the film really took on a new shape.  Unlike many who have commented that the film is not a comedy, I certainly think it is.  I found myself laughing my ass off at a few lines in particular and thought the entire movie was delivered with a nice touch of humor.  Moreover, it is a comedy in the sense of the overall arch of the main character.  However, I suppose that if one's definition of a ""comedy"" is a film done in the style of a SNL production, then this film will probably not please.  This is not _Old School_--it is a bit of a dark comedy about reconnecting with the world again.There are a few scenes in this film that are superbly well done, parts where the script connects with the audience and everything comes together.  Fortunately, there are enough of them to make up for any awkwardness in the pacing that results from any movie attempting to balance itself between humor and emotional intensity.  This film is certainly worth a rent and even purchasing if you can find it for a decent price.  With wonderful acting, a great oddball script and premise, and what is quickly becoming acknowledge a stellar soundtrack, _Garden State_ delivers exactly what it promised and much, much more.

628742,A14SO48SN83R3U,B00005JNC2,Darren,"[2, 3]","Zach Braff puts forth a noble effort in his writing/directorial debut. He develops interesting and mildly quirky characters, but unfortunately, they are left to support only an adequate plot involving themes of love, death and ""what am I going to do with my life"" angst.  The plot, much like the characters, seemed to be in a stage of twenty-something limbo. If it was intentional, I don't think it worked in the manner it was intended and managed to dull some of the luster from the shining characters.Beyond the plot weakness, Braff does a good job of acting the emotionally numb lead role while Natalie Portman (whose previous acting I don't care for) gives her best performances to date in the supporting role. Their characters initially, are on two opposite ends of spectrum. His character is numb and emotionally distant while hers is supersensitive.  Somehow, a romance seems to bring them together and balance them out a bit before the story ends.  There's also some interesting but subtle commentary and insight which illustrates the potential overuse and mis-use of both recreational and professionally prescribed drugs.The cinematography, visual imagery and soundtrack also do a good job of keeping this movie slightly above average.  The soundtrack featuring Coldplay and The Shins does an excellent job at capturing the mood of the generation-X angst. It's a melodic blend of mild indie-pop, rock and alt-country. Many generation x'ers seem to have enjoyed the soundtrack more than the film itself.The documentary about the making of the film is also worth watching.Overall, Garden State is a good directorial debut for Braff and one worth, at least, the cost of a rental.",3,Good Directorial Debut,1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,1685,"['Zach', 'Braff', 'forth', 'noble', 'effort', 'writing/directorial', 'debut', 'interesting', 'mildly', 'quirky', 'characters', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'left', 'support', 'only', 'adequate', 'plot', 'involving', 'themes', 'love', 'death', 'what', 'am', 'going', 'do', 'life', 'angst', 'plot', 'much', 'characters', 'seemed', 'be', 'stage', 'twenty-something', 'limbo', 'was', 'intentional', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worked', 'manner', 'was', 'intended', 'managed', 'dull', 'luster', 'shining', 'characters.Beyond', 'plot', 'weakness', 'Braff', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'emotionally', 'numb', 'lead', 'role', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'previous', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'best', 'performances', 'date', 'supporting', 'role', 'characters', 'initially', 'are', 'two', 'opposite', 'ends', 'spectrum', 'character', 'numb', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'hers', 'supersensitive', 'Somehow', 'romance', 'bring', 'together', 'balance', 'out', 'bit', 'story', 'also', 'interesting', 'subtle', 'commentary', 'insight', 'potential', 'overuse', 'mis-use', 'recreational', 'professionally', 'prescribed', 'drugs.The', 'cinematography', 'visual', 'imagery', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'movie', 'slightly', 'average', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Coldplay', 'Shins', 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'mood', 'generation-X', 'angst', 'melodic', 'blend', 'mild', 'indie-pop', 'rock', 'alt-country', 'Many', 'generation', ""x'ers"", 'seem', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'soundtrack', 'more', 'film', 'itself.The', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'also', 'worth', 'watching.Overall', 'Garden', 'State', 'good', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Braff', 'one', 'worth', 'least', 'cost', 'rental']",Garden State

(Think about it.) The death of his mother ostensibly creates an opportunity for Ray to bond with his coldly British father, Ian Holm, but things are as awkward as ever and pop remains distant... probably because he has nagging doubts about Ray really being his progeny. Ray is torn. Ray is confused. Ray is trying to find himself. It's a shame about Ray. I am Ray's seething revenge. Wait a minute...Ray is a sensitive guy. We know this because he maintains a superior air and only reluctantly participates in the wild orgy of young-person debauchery that surrounds him. (Contents include drugs, alcohol, smoking, and sexual situations, i.e. kissing. Oh, those young people, with their kissing.) Ray is coming of age, and through Ray we explore universal 'coming of age' crises and conflicts. For instance, Ray is surrounded by his old friends, yet he feels alienated by their efforts to exploit his success in Hollywood. Little wonder that the stress of Ray's constant soul-smirking catches up to him in the form of devastating ""split-second"" headaches, which prompt a same-day appointment for an MRI -- again, a universal rite of passage into adulthood. How will he ever get to the Garden State? Exit 12, maybe?Forty-five minutes into this ""The Graduate for the 90's, er, 00's"" and the lead character has yet to express an emotion other than mild scorn. Eventually, Queen Amidala shows up and uses her newfound Jedi mind tricks to bring him out of his shell. Hey, that's a new one!

628749,AID9DAZ4N5NN4,B00005JNC2,Dayna Morrisey,"[10, 15]","I realize that my review will probably be marked unhelpful as mine is not the popular opinion.  I make no apologies, except to say that what I am writing is, in my opinion, fair and not an outright slam of the film.First, I have to profess my admiration and enormous respect for Zach Braff as an actor. He is talented and charming. I was extremely excited to see his debut as both a writer and producer. I heard Garden State compared to other creative indie productions I enjoyed such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Lost in Translation. Unfortunately, I am not of the same opinion.I found the majority of the films quirkiness to be refreshing. Braff's personality and humor really shined through and provided much needed comic relief. It could not carry the film though.I felt the dialogue and acting was wanting. My main problem with the film was that the quirky and creative moments were peppered with contrived moments. At times, I felt the message of the film was shoved down my throat. There were beautifully shot scenes illustrating Braff's loneliness and struggle that were undone by spelling it out ad nauseam via dialogue. Pivotal moments in the movie were lost on trite rhetoric. Braff was ineffectual in scenes that were meant to be riveting, such as the scene where he confronts his father. I didn't feel the coldness between them. There was little passion and anger. Braff's portrayal of a cold, unfeeling, Prozac-nation bi-product, was wonderful. But when his lust for life was revamped, it didn't come through. It felt like it was missing a piece, ultimately falling flat where it really needed to shine.Overall, I had a hard time connecting with characters. Braff would grab me, but the interaction with the other cast members was often times forced or uninteresting. I felt Portman's character was overtly eccentric, making her more annoying than endearing in certain scenes.The premise of the film was certainly interesting, but it was undercooked. Perhaps if Braff let someone else direct it would have melted together more smoothly. It takes a very special talent to both star and direct a film, especially one attempting to challenge human emotion paradigms. I don't think he has it together yet. That said, I look forward to future ventures from Braff. He does have promise. Hopefully he has learned from his rookie mistakes and will turn out a more even and compelling film the next go.",3,It was just okay.,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,2423,"['realize', 'review', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'marked', 'unhelpful', 'mine', 'not', 'popular', 'opinion', 'make', 'apologies', 'say', 'what', 'am', 'writing', 'opinion', 'fair', 'not', 'outright', 'slam', 'film.First', 'have', 'profess', 'admiration', 'enormous', 'respect', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'actor', 'talented', 'charming', 'was', 'extremely', 'excited', 'see', 'debut', 'writer', 'producer', 'heard', 'Garden', 'State', 'compared', 'other', 'creative', 'indie', 'productions', 'enjoyed', 'such', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Unfortunately', 'am', 'not', 'same', 'opinion.I', 'found', 'majority', 'films', 'quirkiness', 'be', 'refreshing', 'Braff', 'personality', 'humor', 'really', 'shined', 'provided', 'much', 'needed', 'comic', 'relief', 'could', 'not', 'carry', 'film', 'though.I', 'felt', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'was', 'wanting', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'quirky', 'creative', 'moments', 'were', 'peppered', 'contrived', 'moments', 'times', 'felt', 'message', 'film', 'was', 'shoved', 'down', 'throat', 'were', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'scenes', 'illustrating', 'Braff', 'loneliness', 'struggle', 'were', 'undone', 'spelling', 'out', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'dialogue', 'Pivotal', 'moments', 'movie', 'were', 'lost', 'trite', 'rhetoric', 'Braff', 'was', 'ineffectual', 'scenes', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'riveting', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'coldness', 'was', 'little', 'passion', 'anger', 'Braff', 'portrayal', 'cold', 'unfeeling', 'Prozac-nation', 'bi-product', 'was', 'wonderful', 'when', 'lust', 'life', 'was', 'revamped', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'felt', 'was', 'missing', 'piece', 'ultimately', 'falling', 'flat', 'where', 'really', 'needed', 'shine.Overall', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'connecting', 'characters', 'Braff', 'would', 'grab', 'interaction', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'was', 'often', 'times', 'forced', 'uninteresting', 'felt', 'Portman', 'character', 'was', 'overtly', 'eccentric', 'making', 'more', 'annoying', 'endearing', 'certain', 'scenes.The', 'premise', 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'was', 'undercooked', 'Perhaps', 'Braff', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'direct', 'would', 'have', 'melted', 'together', 'more', 'smoothly', 'very', 'special', 'talent', 'star', 'direct', 'film', 'especially', 'one', 'attempting', 'challenge', 'human', 'emotion', 'paradigms', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'together', 'yet', 'said', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'ventures', 'Braff', 'have', 'promise', 'Hopefully', 'learned', 'rookie', 'mistakes', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'more', 'even', 'compelling', 'film', 'next', 'go']",Garden State
628750,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JNC2,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 2]","This is a triumph for Zach Braff who directed, wrote, and also stars as Andrew Largeman who finds that love beats the holy heck out of lithium and assorted drugs bizarrely prescribed by his unfeeling father who just happens to be a shrink.  Ladies and gentleman never let your father be your shrink.I was quite taken with Natalie Portman who plays Sam who turns out to be Large's true love, and such a kinky, quirky, beautiful true love she is.  Portman eschews beauty in every scene but manages to be cute and sweet and very emotionally evolved, which I liked.  She is of course beautiful and brilliant as everybody knows, but here she tries something different.  She strives to be ordinary and slight but with great emotive power.  Nice performance.The sound track which reminded this old guy of something from Simon and Garfunkel, and in fact there is a Simon and Garfunkel tune on it, was the sort of sweet, nostalgia-producing, alternative rock kind of sweet angst sound that lets you know that this is what youth is all about.Largeman, wanna-be and somewhat successful/somewhat failed actor out on loan, comes home from the big city to rural New Jersey because his mother has died, unaccountable in a bathtub--which can happen if you are a paraplegic.  He deals with a childhood tragedy and acquired guilt, meets his old buds, including Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) who is a full time slacker and part time dreamer and consummate doper.  Largeman unveils his sidecar mobile--the only thing willed from his grandfather's estate--with its white star on combat green, and tools around town, parties a little and meets quirky Samantha who likes to tell lies as a kind of way to deal with the world.  I knew a girl like that, only she knew when she was lying--if somebody caught her.  Sam figures it's a tick like Tourette's, and anyway her lies are harmless.The movie is sweet and mildly comedic with some original shtick, and at times a bit of a tear-jerker.  More than anything it's a touching love story, which I can never resist.  And, yes, it's very New Jersey like Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi, although no songs by them on the track--not to mention Elizabeth Shue who was a classmate of Braff's in high school.See this for Zach Braff who put a lot of his emotional life into the film and deserves the accolades he's received.",5,Quirky love story with panache,1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,2330,"['triumph', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'who', 'directed', 'wrote', 'also', 'stars', 'Andrew', 'Largeman', 'who', 'love', 'holy', 'heck', 'lithium', 'assorted', 'drugs', 'bizarrely', 'prescribed', 'unfeeling', 'father', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'shrink', 'Ladies', 'gentleman', 'never', 'let', 'father', 'be', 'shrink.I', 'was', 'quite', 'taken', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'Sam', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Large', 'true', 'love', 'kinky', 'quirky', 'beautiful', 'true', 'love', 'Portman', 'beauty', 'scene', 'be', 'cute', 'sweet', 'very', 'emotionally', 'evolved', 'liked', 'course', 'beautiful', 'brilliant', 'everybody', 'here', 'something', 'different', 'be', 'ordinary', 'slight', 'great', 'emotive', 'power', 'Nice', 'performance.The', 'sound', 'track', 'reminded', 'old', 'guy', 'something', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'fact', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'tune', 'was', 'sort', 'sweet', 'nostalgia-producing', 'alternative', 'rock', 'kind', 'sweet', 'angst', 'sound', 'know', 'what', 'youth', 'about.Largeman', 'wanna-be', 'somewhat', 'successful/somewhat', 'failed', 'actor', 'out', 'loan', 'home', 'big', 'city', 'rural', 'New', 'Jersey', 'mother', 'died', 'unaccountable', 'bathtub', 'can', 'happen', 'are', 'paraplegic', 'childhood', 'tragedy', 'acquired', 'guilt', 'old', 'buds', 'including', 'Mark', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'full', 'time', 'slacker', 'part', 'time', 'dreamer', 'consummate', 'doper', 'Largeman', 'sidecar', 'mobile', 'only', 'thing', 'willed', 'grandfather', 'estate', 'white', 'star', 'combat', 'green', 'tools', 'town', 'parties', 'little', 'meets', 'quirky', 'Samantha', 'who', 'tell', 'lies', 'kind', 'way', 'deal', 'world', 'knew', 'girl', 'only', 'knew', 'when', 'was', 'lying', 'somebody', 'caught', 'Sam', 'tick', 'Tourette', 'anyway', 'lies', 'are', 'harmless.The', 'movie', 'sweet', 'mildly', 'comedic', 'original', 'shtick', 'times', 'bit', 'tear-jerker', 'More', 'anything', 'touching', 'love', 'story', 'can', 'never', 'resist', 'yes', 'very', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'songs', 'track', 'not', 'mention', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'who', 'was', 'classmate', 'Braff', 'high', 'school.See', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'who', 'put', 'lot', 'emotional', 'life', 'film', 'accolades', 'received']",Garden State

No, what I hate is that lots of people have them just to have them.  Oh, I see them walking down the street with their little white headphones, nodding at each other like they belong to some secret society.  Oh, they may say they're listening to the Shins, but it wouldn't surprise me if they actually didn't know how to work the thing and were just listening to nothing at all.What does any of this have to do with Garden State?  Garden State strikes me as one of those flicks people say they like without actually liking it.  Give Zach Braff credit.  With Garden State, he accomplishes a lot.  He writes, directs, and stars in his own first feature.  He gets to make out with Natalie Portman (though after hearing her character talk, you may not think this is such a good thing).  And he gets to show people what great musical taste he has.  The Shins?  Check.  Zero 7?  Uh-huh.The problem?  There's no real movie here.  There are lots of musical interludes that don't advance the story.  There's lots of quirky anecdotes.  But there's no story holding everything together.  Some of the pieces are there, but Garden State takes so many detours it doesn't end up going anywhere.And frankly, despite all that, I probably still would have liked the flick if Portman's character never appeared on screen.  In what's easily the most awkward comic performance since Heather Graham ruined the second Austin Powers flick, Portman intrudes on the film like the girl in college who lived across the hall and never, ever, shut up.It struck me watching Garden State that Portman is this generation's equivalent of Winona Ryder.  I knew someone who worked with Ryder, who said everyone was so transfixed by her beauty that they didn't realize her performance was terrible until it was too late.  And so it is with Portman, who can't pull off the sort of character that Kate Winslet made indelible in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  In a quiet film, her Sam is the grating character that everyone in the movie likes but no one in the audience does.But I've complained too much.  Some people are programmed to like movies like Garden State, because they don't want their barista to be angry with them.  And that's all right.  But one day, Zach Braff (who is clearly talented) will realize the importance of what his movie is as opposed to what's in it.

There are a lot of wryly funny jokes.  Several good and interesting songs can be heard in the movie.  Zach Braff and Peter Sarsgaard convincingly display different flavors of ennui.  There are many memorable scenes and images in the movie -- it was thoughtfully written and filmed.But there are at least two things that bothered me about the movie -- one that struck me while I was watching it, and one that occurs to me as I look back at the film.  One is, simply, Natalie Portman.  She's supposed to be the mysterious pixie-next-door who's both enchanting and a bit damaged, but I did not find her remotely believeable.  The chemistry that should have developed between her and Braff just fizzled.  Over and over I kept thinking ""Oh God, she's annoying"", and waited for her to show some appealing characteristics, but I never saw any.  It was very frustrating -- in the middle of an otherwise nicely acted indie film was this Hollywood star, apparently cast because of her big-name cachet, who just didn't have the screen presence to make me like her character at all.My other complaint is that Braff's character is supposed to develop, shaking off the shackles of his complacency and medication and father's stern gaze, but it's not really visible.  I can only recall one scene where Braff is actually dynamic.  I liked his performance in general, but I thought there should have been a little more, I don't know, fireworks in the movie.  I probably wouldn't even have this complaint if Ms. Portman didn't let me down so much -- she should have seemed like a catalyst for his development, and not just like a girl with nothing better to do.But don't pay too much attention to my grumbling -- I still thought ""Garden State"" was worth seeing, worth hearing, and worth thinking about afterwards.",4,"Pretty good, but flawed",1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,1932,"['lot', 'like', 'Garden', 'State', 'story', 'young', 'actor', 'return', 'Hollywood', 'New', 'Jersey', 'mother', 'funeral', 'are', 'lot', 'wryly', 'funny', 'jokes', 'Several', 'good', 'interesting', 'songs', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'movie', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'convincingly', 'display', 'different', 'flavors', 'ennui', 'are', 'many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'images', 'movie', 'was', 'thoughtfully', 'written', 'filmed.But', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'things', 'bothered', 'movie', 'one', 'struck', 'was', 'watching', 'one', 'look', 'back', 'film', 'One', 'simply', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'supposed', 'be', 'mysterious', 'pixie-next-door', 'who', 'enchanting', 'bit', 'damaged', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'remotely', 'believeable', 'chemistry', 'should', 'have', 'developed', 'Braff', 'just', 'fizzled', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Oh', 'God', 'annoying', 'waited', 'show', 'appealing', 'characteristics', 'never', 'saw', 'was', 'very', 'frustrating', 'middle', 'otherwise', 'nicely', 'acted', 'indie', 'film', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'apparently', 'cast', 'big-name', 'cachet', 'who', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'screen', 'presence', 'make', 'character', 'all.My', 'other', 'complaint', 'Braff', 'character', 'supposed', 'develop', 'shaking', 'off', 'shackles', 'complacency', 'medication', 'father', 'stern', 'gaze', 'not', 'really', 'visible', 'can', 'only', 'recall', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Braff', 'actually', 'dynamic', 'liked', 'performance', 'general', 'thought', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fireworks', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'complaint', 'Ms.', 'Portman', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'so', 'much', 'should', 'have', 'seemed', 'catalyst', 'development', 'not', 'just', 'girl', 'nothing', 'better', 'do.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'grumbling', 'still', 'thought', 'Garden', 'State', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'worth', 'hearing', 'worth', 'thinking', 'afterwards']",Garden State

628756,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JNC2,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","The directorial film debut of television actor Zach Braff (who also wrote the script and stars) seems to be in danger of getting carried away with its own quirkiness about every five minutes. However, sheer earnestness, a keen ear for dialogue and a strong cast prevent this movie from going through the trapdoor of Braff's eccentric, heavily stylized view of his world. Inspired in part by his own life, Braff's movie tells the story of Andrew Largeman, a struggling television actor/waiter who returns to his hometown in New Jersey for the funeral of his mother. He is nearly catatonic with denial about his estrangement from his family and in particular, his father. He also reunites with some of his old friends, notably his grave-digging stoner buddy, Mark, and most importantly, meets and falls in love with Sam, a motor-mouthed Holly Golightly-type, who helps Andrew find himself again. It turns out that Andrew's psychiatrist father has been prescribing medication for him to stabilize his mood swings, one episode of which accidentally caused a deep and what seems to be an irreparable rift with his parents.The film moves fluidly between humor and pathos, and fortunately Braff knows when to avoid making the story more heavy-handed than it needs to be. At various times, the film gets lost in its own visual style (such as the use of fast motion surrounding the static protagonist) and heavy use of symbolism (for example, the ark on the edge of a crater), making it feel a bit more contrived than it should. And the alternative rock soundtrack, while terrifically evocative, also creates that aura of creeping irrelevance. But Braff is smart enough to know to focus primarily on his characters, and that's the film's saving grace and greatest strength. Quite a remarkable cast has been assembled for such a small film. British acting stalwart Ian Holm is oddly cast as Andrew's father, but he is briefly effective in spite of the fact that most of the footage explaining his character's remoteness ended up on the cutting room floor (as seen in the deleted scenes). As pot-smoking, guitar-strumming Mark, Peter Sarsgaard proves again what a fiercely intelligent and versatile actor he is. It's hard to believe this is the same actor who played the conscientious magazine editor in ""Shattered Glass"" or the beguiling sex researcher in ""Kinsey"". Jean Smart has a funny cameo as Mark's blowsy mother, and they have a hilarious scene around the breakfast table talking to Mark's brother about his medieval castle job and speaking Klingon. As Sam, Natalie Portman is charming throughout, even though her character's random eccentricities constantly threaten to overwhelm her appeal. Braff himself seems less assured as a leading man perhaps because he sets up his character to be more of an observer until he comes to life in the concluding scenes, yet he does create a sense of good will that makes you want to know what will happen to him throughout the story.Some of the plot strands do not work as smoothly as one would hope, for example, the burgeoning love between Andrew and Sam seems a bit jumpy in treatment and the reconciliation with his father feels fairly pat considering the painful history that preceded it. But on the plus side, Braff captures his childhood environment and adulthood angst with pinpoint emotional accuracy. At its best, the movie will remind you of the sense of isolation Benjamin Braddock felt in Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate"".  There is a good making-of documentary included in the DVD, as well as a series of deleted scenes that actually do help fill in some blanks left in the final film.

It's a character-driven movie (the kind I typically like), more about everyone's quirks and interactions than about any actual events.  And while Braff succeeds in many ways, the movie also bears a few flaws that keep it from being great.For the most part, Garden State is very well-acted.  Ian Holm (as the main character's father) and Peter Sarsgaard (as an old friend from high school, Mark) fare particularly well, creating vivid people out of a relatively small number of lines.  Holm is of course a veteran of considerable stature in the craft, fresh from his turn as Bilbo in the Lord of the Rings.  He brings not only a frightening countenance to the role of Gideon Largeman, but the kind of expertise that only comes with decades of acting experience.  Sarsgaard is another excellent actor, whom I had already seen in Center of the World.  Here he exceeds all reasonable expectations as a stoner with some questionable habits and less than perfect social skills.  Whether he plays a leading role or a supporting one, Sarsgaard is always a pleasure to watch.Natalie Portman does a good job with a poorly conceived character in Garden State.  As Andrew's unlikely girlfriend Sam, she is a compulsive, giddy liar, more annoying than appealing.  Everything about Sam says ""run far, far away,"" and yet Andrew Largeman feels drawn to her.  I suppose this is only possible with a protagonist who has been on one medication or another for fifteen-plus years.  And yet, even if that makes their match a credible one, it doesn't necessarily make them a couple who are enjoyable to watch.Furthermore, much of the movie is spent focusing on Andrew Largeman feeling nothing when he should feel something.  It's tough to sympathize with this kind of person, and the viewer consequently feels almost as detached from him as he feels from the rest of the world.  By the time he finally does start to exhibit emotion, you have to wonder: why did it have to take this long?Garden State also suffers from what can only be called too many coincidences.  We're talking about New Jersey, people, not a prairie town in South Dakota.  Not everyone has to know everyone else.  And yet Andrew can't go anywhere or do anything without running into someone he knew in high school.For all its flaws, Garden State does boast some memorable dialogue and the soundtrack is very nice on the ears.  Although I won't be buying a copy of the movie, I will be picking up the music which scored it so perfectly.It's nice to see Braff put together a competent movie, as writer, director, and leading actor.  He's no Orson Welles, but we don't see many auteurs these days.  Garden State will resonate best with emotionally stranded twenty-somethings and intelligent teenagers who are ready for something with more depth than the next sequel to The Fast and the Furious.",3,A flawed but impressive debut for Braff,1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,2925,"['watched', 'Garden', 'State', 'yesterday', 'hearing', 'great', 'things', 'brother', 'character-driven', 'movie', 'kind', 'typically', 'more', 'everyone', 'quirks', 'interactions', 'actual', 'events', 'Braff', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'also', 'few', 'flaws', 'keep', 'being', 'great.For', 'most', 'part', 'Garden', 'State', 'very', 'well-acted', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'main', 'character', 'father', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'old', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'Mark', 'fare', 'particularly', 'well', 'creating', 'vivid', 'people', 'relatively', 'small', 'number', 'lines', 'Holm', 'course', 'veteran', 'considerable', 'stature', 'craft', 'fresh', 'turn', 'Bilbo', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'not', 'only', 'frightening', 'countenance', 'role', 'Gideon', 'Largeman', 'kind', 'expertise', 'only', 'decades', 'acting', 'experience', 'Sarsgaard', 'excellent', 'actor', 'whom', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'Center', 'World', 'Here', 'reasonable', 'expectations', 'stoner', 'questionable', 'habits', 'less', 'perfect', 'social', 'skills', 'leading', 'role', 'supporting', 'one', 'Sarsgaard', 'always', 'pleasure', 'watch.Natalie', 'Portman', 'good', 'job', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'character', 'Garden', 'State', 'Andrew', 'unlikely', 'girlfriend', 'Sam', 'compulsive', 'giddy', 'liar', 'more', 'annoying', 'appealing', 'Everything', 'Sam', 'run', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'yet', 'Andrew', 'Largeman', 'drawn', 'suppose', 'only', 'possible', 'protagonist', 'who', 'been', 'one', 'medication', 'fifteen-plus', 'years', 'yet', 'even', 'match', 'credible', 'one', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'watch.Furthermore', 'much', 'movie', 'spent', 'focusing', 'Andrew', 'Largeman', 'feeling', 'nothing', 'when', 'should', 'feel', 'something', 'tough', 'sympathize', 'kind', 'person', 'viewer', 'consequently', 'almost', 'detached', 'rest', 'world', 'time', 'finally', 'start', 'exhibit', 'emotion', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', 'have', 'take', 'long', 'Garden', 'State', 'also', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'too', 'many', 'coincidences', ""'re"", 'talking', 'New', 'Jersey', 'people', 'not', 'prairie', 'town', 'South', 'Dakota', 'Not', 'everyone', 'know', 'everyone', 'else', 'yet', 'Andrew', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'do', 'anything', 'running', 'someone', 'knew', 'high', 'school.For', 'flaws', 'Garden', 'State', 'boast', 'memorable', 'dialogue', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'nice', 'ears', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'copy', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'picking', 'up', 'music', 'scored', 'so', 'perfectly.It', 'nice', 'see', 'Braff', 'put', 'together', 'competent', 'movie', 'writer', 'director', 'leading', 'actor', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'auteurs', 'days', 'Garden', 'State', 'will', 'resonate', 'best', 'emotionally', 'stranded', 'twenty-somethings', 'intelligent', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'ready', 'something', 'more', 'depth', 'next', 'sequel', 'Fast', 'Furious']",Garden State

I did not view it as a comedy, and it certainly isn't ""hilarious"", though being a native of New Jersey I was amused to see how the movie depicted it as the wasteland it is; how people still think it's cool to chain-smoke and do drugs and party and be superficial and boring. The lead character, Andrew, returns to this for his mother's funeral, after having achieved a moderate amount of success as an actor in California. He has been overmedicated and emotionally numb since his mom became a paraplegic many years prior in a freak accident when Andrew was nine. Andrew has just discontinued these meds when he meets the Natalie Portman character, a compulsive liar among other things I found irritating, but under the circumstances and compared to the other slugs he has for friends there in Jersey, he opens up to her, eventually falling in love. As they embrace in Newark Airport, what happens next remains to be seen because that's how the movie ends.

At the beginning of the film, Largeman receives a call from his father (played by Ian Holm) to return home because his mother has died by drowning. Largeman returns home as the conquering hero, resting mostly on the laurels of his made-for-TV movie, in which he played a handicapped individual.Largeman quickly reacquaints himself who his childhood oddball friends, which include: a kleptomaniac gravedigger, a knight's-of-the-roundtable dinner theater waiter, and a guy who has invented ""no-sound"" Velcro (which also made him rich).As the story progresses, we learn that Largeman has been away from home for quite so time due to a childhood accident in which he permanently paralyzed his mother. His psychiatrist father has had him under medication since the age of 9, and has never quite gotten over blaming Largeman for the incident. Largeman has also decided to use his mother's death, as justification to discontinue his medication.Along the way, Largeman meets Sam (played by Natalie Portman), who is everything that he's not; and a relationship is formed. With Sam's help, Largeman is finally able to face his demons, his father, and start living his life coherently.Garden State is bizarre at times; however, always genuine.

At times, it can be very funny, but this is outweighed by a stifling layer of depression that coats everything throughout. I believe it was supposed to ultimately be an uplifting tale of finding one's own place in the world, standing up for yourself, etc., but this is tarnished by the fact that every character is self-centered nearly to the point of narcissism. Particularly bad was the character who lives with his mom, digs graves for a living, ROBS the dead of their jewelry, and shoplifts in his spare time... and yet, this is a character that we're supposed to feel sympathy for, and applaud his supposedly noble deed at the end of the movie (which I will not spoil here).As for Zach's character, he spends so much time feeling sorry for himself, wallowing about, and disregarding responsibility, I simply couldn't get on board with him. I get it: You're twenty something and depressed, because you don't know what to do with your life and what the future might hold. But this is incredibly boring (especially after an hour and forty minutes), and it inspired pity for the character, not empathy.

It is rare when a film is conceived, written, directed and acted by one person and the result is a unique and timely little treasure like this one.Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) lives in Los Angeles as an actor and is in a vegetative state of emotional paralysis supported by mind-numbing medications.  A call from his cold and distant father (Ian Holm) informs him he is needed at home in New Jersey to attend the funeral of his physically paralyzed mother who has accidentally drowned in the bathtub. Andrew flies to New Jersey (in a film sequence of a crashing plane that is unexpectedly hilarious) to the family and friends he has not seen in nine years.  His friends include some of the quirkiest folks you're likely to meet: Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), Kenny the cop (Michael Weston), Dave (Alex Burns) among others.  These folks are all as odd as Andrew and it is only when Andrew encounters Samantha the chronic liar (Natalie Portman) that he is able to begin to absorbs Sam's lust for living and ultimately get a grip on his aimless life, face his demons (the major one having to do with his mother's paralysis...) and commit to change.The action is fast, with pauses for some absolutely ludicrous events that are at once hilarious and tender.  All of the actors are superb, with Portman, Braff and Sarsgaard the most outstanding.  It may take a while to filter the storyline and process of filming through your mind: this is creative filmmaking at a new level. But the ultimate effect is a piece of work that deserves repeated viewings and serves notice that Braff is a talent to watch.

The set designs are boring and uninteresting, the directing is bland and completely uninspired, and the writing is typical indie garbage about *slightly* dysfunctional people doing *quirky* things like crying over a pet cemetary or wearing a shirt that matches the wall; wow, that's so deep/clever/original Zach Braff, anything else to say in your bloated turd of a movie besides 'let the little stuff go'?

Andrew receives a call from his father, Gideon (Ian Holm), telling him that his mother has just drowned in the bathtub. After nine years of being absent from his hometown in New Jersey, Andrew returns for his mother's funeral. He doesn't cry at the graveside ceremony. Later in the film he confesses that he tried to, but couldn't. He thought of the saddest things he had seen in movies and even pictured a haunting photograph he had seen in a magazine, but nothing worked for him. He thought of everything except the passing of his mother. This says a lot about how his psyche has been warped.Andrew, according to his father, is responsible for his mother's death. When Andrew was nine he got frustrated with his mother and weakly pushed her. She fell and hit the back of her neck on the kitchen counter, paralyzing her from the waist down and confining her to a wheel chair. In theory, she wouldn't have drowned had she not been paralyzed. This incident plagued Andrew with psychiatry and prescriptions that sedated his inner being for sixteen years. He is now twenty-five, motherless, and trying to find his place in life.He and his father lack stable communication, and in an early scene we can tell that Gideon, to some degree, hates his son. Andrew claims that he was only a kid who didn't know what he was doing or what he was capable of. ""Garden State"" doesn't argue whether or not Andrew is truly guilty of his mother's death. It  depicts the release that Andrew has when he accidentally leaves his medications at home, flies to New Jersey, and begins to experience life for the first time ever.At his mother's funeral, Andrew runs into his childhood buddy Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), who works as a gravedigger at the cemetery. So apparently uninterested is Andrew in the passing of his mother that he makes plans to meet up with Mark and his crew later on that evening. That night he is at a drunken party with Mark and his friends, high on ecstasy and playing Spin-The-Bottle. The game soon requires a beautiful girl to kiss him, and she does so with more than just willingness. We wouldn't be the least bit surprised if this were Andrew's first kiss.Andrew's hometown is populated by strange people, but none so distinguished as Sam (Natalie Portman), a free-spirited young woman whom he meets in a doctor's clinic. Occupied by an odd persona, Sam begins to show Andrew a side of life he has never seen before. Its as if this beautiful woman with unusual quirks (""Whenever I feel unoriginal, I make a noise that no one else in the world has ever made and then I feel good about myself."") has rescued him from a prison that he has been held in all of his life. Interesting how she is better at therapy than drugs or psychiatrists.""Garden State"" is a strange movie in the sense that it is about real people. Let's face it, we are all weird in some way, and that is what the movie depicts. Some characters are marginally weird and others, like Sam or Mark's mother (Jean Smart), are off the charts. The reality of the film is what makes it strange, and the world that the characters inhabit functions like a microscope in which we can closely analyze the people around us. Its actually very brilliant.A film like this is a showboat for acting ability, especially for the film's writer and director, Zach Braff, in the engrossing role of Andrew. And let it be said that Natalie Portman delivers what has to be the most colorful and energetic performance of her career. She handles the role of Sam with a graceful aplomb in a role that should be talked about and studied for years to come. Placing Sam in this universe of delicate detail is something that Braff did with care; few writer-directors are as passionate about their films as he is.In his writing, directing, and acting debut, Braff has visualized the newfound joys of a young man who is out of touch with reality. Braff's film is also out of touch with reality, but also in touch with reality by its oddities. We, as people, would hate to admit that some of us can relate to these characters. Just imagine Roy from ""Matchstick Men"" coming across a few of them and you'd have a spinoff worth seeing. - IsaacRated R; 109 minutes; Directed by Zach Braff",4,Garden State,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,4416,"['Andrew', 'Largeman', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'most', 'life', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'experiences', 'have', 'been', 'numbed', 'where', 'are', 'less', 'memorable', 'actually', 'are', 'Andrew', 'call', 'father', 'Gideon', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'telling', 'mother', 'just', 'drowned', 'bathtub', 'nine', 'years', 'being', 'absent', 'hometown', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Andrew', 'mother', 'funeral', ""n't"", 'cry', 'graveside', 'ceremony', 'Later', 'film', 'tried', 'could', ""n't"", 'thought', 'saddest', 'things', 'had', 'seen', 'movies', 'even', 'pictured', 'haunting', 'photograph', 'had', 'seen', 'magazine', 'nothing', 'worked', 'thought', 'everything', 'passing', 'mother', 'lot', 'how', 'psyche', 'been', 'warped.Andrew', 'according', 'father', 'responsible', 'mother', 'death', 'When', 'Andrew', 'was', 'nine', 'got', 'frustrated', 'mother', 'weakly', 'pushed', 'fell', 'hit', 'back', 'neck', 'kitchen', 'counter', 'paralyzing', 'waist', 'down', 'confining', 'wheel', 'chair', 'theory', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'drowned', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'paralyzed', 'incident', 'plagued', 'Andrew', 'psychiatry', 'prescriptions', 'sedated', 'inner', 'being', 'sixteen', 'years', 'now', 'twenty-five', 'motherless', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'life.He', 'father', 'lack', 'stable', 'communication', 'early', 'scene', 'can', 'tell', 'Gideon', 'degree', 'son', 'Andrew', 'was', 'only', 'kid', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'capable', 'Garden', 'State', ""n't"", 'argue', 'not', 'Andrew', 'truly', 'guilty', 'mother', 'death', 'release', 'Andrew', 'when', 'accidentally', 'medications', 'home', 'flies', 'New', 'Jersey', 'experience', 'life', 'first', 'time', 'ever.At', 'mother', 'funeral', 'Andrew', 'childhood', 'buddy', 'Mark', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'gravedigger', 'cemetery', 'So', 'apparently', 'uninterested', 'Andrew', 'passing', 'mother', 'plans', 'meet', 'up', 'Mark', 'crew', 'later', 'evening', 'night', 'drunken', 'party', 'Mark', 'friends', 'high', 'ecstasy', 'playing', 'Spin-The-Bottle', 'game', 'soon', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'kiss', 'so', 'more', 'just', 'willingness', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'least', 'bit', 'surprised', 'were', 'Andrew', 'first', 'kiss.Andrew', 'hometown', 'populated', 'strange', 'people', 'none', 'so', 'distinguished', 'Sam', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'free-spirited', 'young', 'woman', 'whom', 'doctor', 'clinic', 'Occupied', 'odd', 'persona', 'Sam', 'show', 'Andrew', 'side', 'life', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'unusual', 'quirks', 'Whenever', 'feel', 'unoriginal', 'make', 'noise', 'one', 'else', 'world', 'ever', 'made', 'then', 'feel', 'good', 'rescued', 'prison', 'been', 'held', 'life', 'Interesting', 'how', 'better', 'therapy', 'drugs', 'psychiatrists', 'Garden', 'State', 'strange', 'movie', 'sense', 'real', 'people', 'Let', 'face', 'are', 'weird', 'way', 'what', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'marginally', 'weird', 'others', 'Sam', 'Mark', 'mother', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'are', 'charts', 'reality', 'film', 'what', 'strange', 'world', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'functions', 'microscope', 'can', 'closely', 'analyze', 'people', 'actually', 'very', 'brilliant.A', 'film', 'showboat', 'acting', 'ability', 'especially', 'film', 'writer', 'director', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'engrossing', 'role', 'Andrew', 'let', 'be', 'said', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'be', 'most', 'colorful', 'energetic', 'performance', 'career', 'role', 'Sam', 'graceful', 'aplomb', 'role', 'should', 'be', 'talked', 'studied', 'years', 'come', 'Placing', 'Sam', 'universe', 'delicate', 'detail', 'something', 'Braff', 'did', 'care', 'few', 'writer-directors', 'are', 'passionate', 'films', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'debut', 'Braff', 'visualized', 'newfound', 'joys', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'touch', 'reality', 'Braff', 'film', 'also', 'touch', 'reality', 'also', 'touch', 'reality', 'oddities', 'people', 'would', 'hate', 'admit', 'can', 'relate', 'characters', 'Just', 'imagine', 'Roy', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'coming', 'few', ""'d"", 'have', 'spinoff', 'worth', 'seeing', 'IsaacRated', 'R', '109', 'minutes', 'Directed', 'Zach', 'Braff']",Garden State

His familial relationships have been strained since childhood, and his ""friendships"" from school ignored.

When he returns home, he meets a girl who is his opposite--a bit of a neurotic mess, but charming nonetheless, who opens him up to the possibility of letting his guard down and really experiencing life.This film is funny, serious, romantic (in a non-cute way), clever, artistic (without being too pretentious) all at the same time.  While a few things seemed a bit strained (I don't think that the main character really *needs* to be on drugs to feel alienated from his hometown, father, emotions, etc.--it seems a bit gimmicky in a way, though overmedication is definitely a real problem), in all it flows really well and is believable in its dialogue.I really related to Large's feelings of disconnect and sense of no direction....

And who knew he had within him the directing skills to pull off such a powerfully quiet performance and movie. Garden State takes off with a vision of quirkiness, and lands nearly perfectly on its two feet at the end.Braff, who wrote, directed, and starred in this movie, plays Andrew Largeman, a one time California actor who's forced to return to his childhood home after the untimely death of his mother. Landing in New Jersey, zombie-like Largeman is placed in the middle of his many issues, having at once to begin to deal with them. In the mix, Natalie Portman plays Samantha, a seemingly bizarre girl who's the most refreshing wind in Largeman's stale life. They meet, and a fairly predictable story ensues.However, the beauty of this script lies not in the story, but the quiet craziness that Braff inhabits in the movie. Nearly every scene revels in something bizarre, be it a shirt that matches wallpaper, or Samantha's hamster-loving house. Never once is this quirkiness exploited, but unfolds as naturally as Braff's performance as Largeman. You can trust Braff's unpredictability throughout the movie, because it's rich and gentle at the same time. There are too many moments in this film that are memorable, and visually stunning.It's only the ending of the film, which I shall not reveal, that somewhat betrays the rest of the tone of the film. Sure I was pleased with it, but it all in all felt somewhat false and forced on us. Many people I'm sure love the ending, but I wasn't convinced with it. That being said, it wasn't enough to ruin any part of the rest of this film.If this is the world that Braff inhabits in his imagination, the world is in store for more beauty from him in the near future.

628783,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00005JNC2,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[1, 3]","""Garden State"" is a delightful, quirky film, geared to entertain with its eccentric characters and bizarre, dark humor. A coming-of-age tale long overdue, this is a magical, edgy romantic comedy, (that guys will enjoy), with some hilarious moments, as well as a few tremendously moving ones. And the acting is excellent! I was left with a warm and fuzzy feeling for hours after the conclusion - a welcome change from the film I saw prior to this, which gave me a headache!.Zach Braff wrote the intelligent screenplay, directed it and plays Andrew Largeman, a twenty-six year old who hasn't had a feeling since age nine, when his psychiatrist father, (Ian Holm), medicated him with almost everything available on the pharmacological market to block anger, anxiety, and depression. (The reason for the pill consumption will be revealed in the movie). Since Andrew was always too zombied-out to consider changing shrinks, he has been on meds every since. All Dr. Largeman wanted, and wants, (so he says), is for his son to be happy. Originally from the great state of NJ, Andrew now lives in LA where he pursues an acting career and works as a waiter. He's best known for his role as a retarded quarterback in a TV series.Dad calls Andrew one morning to inform him his mother died, (she drowned in the bathtub), and asks him to come home for the funeral. In his heart and mind Andrew knows you can't go home again - he hasn't even tried for almost a decade. However, his mom's funeral is a worthy enough cause to justify his return to the Garden State. When he boards the plane, he leaves his pills behind.After the funeral, Andrew studiously avoids his dad and reunites with some boyhood friends. Almost all are major underachievers. Pal Mark works as a grave digger...who occasionally robs the dead, and is almost permanently attached at the mouth to his bong. His mom (Jean Smart) is, literally, a space cadet. Another buddy works at a medieval reenactment restaurant as a knight, and wears armor to work. The group's success story is Jesse, (Armando Riesco), who invented a silent substitute for Velcro, has made mega money, and gives great parties. Into this crazy mix comes the luminous Sam, (Natalie Portman is absolutely terrific here)!Andrew visits a neurologist because he is experiencing brief but acute headaches. He meets the free-spirited Sam at the doctor's office. She is totally charming, fresh, and epileptic - something she does not tell Andrew for some time. He gives her a ride home and she invites him in just in time to bury her pet hamster. He gets to attend yet another funeral, this time at the family's overpopulated pet cemetery.

I though the two principals were perfect for the roles they were playing.  Of course, Braff wrote his own part, so that should be expected.  What constantly amazes me about Portman is that she is so adaptable to the parts she is playing.  I was dismayed at her performance in Star Wars III, but after watching this film, I realize... that is what was asked of her - and where Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson, or a more forceful actor would gripe about the lines or pacing... she just did exactly what was asked of her.

No matter what anyone has told you already about the film. I notice a lot of people writing that they didn't like Garden State and that's fine, I personally thought it was great. To me it was real life on film, and within that real life there are very different people. Unfortunately not everyone wants to see movies that remind them of reality, and I guess not everybody reality is the same as mine.After seeing this movie last night, it kept replaying in my mind for some reason. It reminded me of the movie ""The Graduate"" (no slight praise) for many reasons, not the least of which was the soundtrack which included a song by Simon and Garfunkel. I mean, why include an old song by S&G; in the middle of a host of contemporary artists - it must have been done on purpose - right? And the pool scene, although different than Hoffman's, still serves to illustrate Andrew Largeman's alienation.Much like the "" The Graduate,"" it was the little things that got to me. The escalators heading in two directions at the end, the making of a completely original dance, the touching of the father, the arc on the edge of the abyss, the silent Velcro...I could go on.Natalie Portman is a great actress and  I enjoy watching her on this films and others that she previously done. Playing the role of a goofy, epileptic but cute, hometown girl, she steals the show. She hits all the right notes. She is responsible for the death by tread-wheel of a loved one, she habitually lies, and she's slightly crazy, but Andrew and we can't help falling in love with her.Even so ""Garden State"" is well worth watching, if only to remind us that the comatose state most of us live in is only temporary, and the joy of a life well lived is forever. Movies like this are either rare or one of kind.

However, I cannot understand why people who review this film constantly venerate Natalie Portman.  Even the people who didn't like the film laud Portman's performance. I, however, wanted to strangle her.  This woman could not act her way out of a shopping bag.  I have despised every role I've seen her in. It's bad enough that she contributed additional lameness to the Star Wars prequels, but does she have to ruin an otherwise solid story by an amateur director? Who cast this girl, anyway? I found her performance contrived, forced and thoroughly annoying, a further testament to her inept acting skills. Why Zach, why? However, her performance did not ruin the film entirely and it is still worth watching and maybe even owning. The soundtrack is great too.  Maybe a future special edition can have a version with Portman's character completely edited out of every scene, dialogue and all, so it looks like Zach Braff is talking and interacting with an imaginary person. I wonder what impact that would have on the story in relation to Braff's character who is already loaded up on medication, taking hallucinogenic drugs, and at a point in life where nothing is as it seems. That might even make me add another star to this review.

The one-time actor, best known for playing a mentally challenged football player in a television movie, drops everything and heads home to New Jersey for the first time in eight years.Largeman may have boarded the plane with just the shirt on his back, but arrives in the Garden State with more personal baggage than the Hilton sisters at a sleep-over.Garden State, which marks the writing-directing debut of star Zach Braff (Scrubs), is a finely- tuned character study that has a lot to say about the human condition. All jokes aside, Garden State emerges as a breath of fresh air in a stagnant late August, a film that not only has something to say, but does so in a refreshing, off-the-cuff approach. As the film's triple threat, Braff is to be commended on not just making an assured debut behind the camera, but for making a film that should stand up to the test of time.As the film's writer, I was constantly amazed at Braff's observations and depth of reference. You never feel that these characters only exist within the confines of the frame. As director, Braff has picked a winning cast who bring his characters to life. Each and every one draw us into Braff's world, hitting just the right pitch to match the script's unique blend of dark comedy and raw emotion. Once we become part of this world, it's hard to leave.Braff peppers the script with casual insights and bits of business that captivate us with their simplicity and honesty. There are revelations, but their design isn't to slap us across the face but expose us to another level of the truth, and it's this sincerity that makes Garden State so inviting. These may be dysfunctional people, but at least their not afraid to admit it.Once home, Largeman makes the rounds, connecting with old friends (Peter Sarsgaard, perfectly laid back), new loves (Natalie Portman, sweet and engaging), marginal acquaintances (half the town thinks he killed himself), finally settling down for the much dreaded father-son confrontation with Ian Holm as the appropriately distant patriarch.Braff is to be admired for making a film that is as entertaining as it is thoughtful. His talent and connections have afforded him the opportunity to create rather than regurgitate. He didn't squander the opportunity.",5,BRAFF'S GARDEN GROWS,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,2411,"['Andrew', 'Largeman', 'been', 'anti-depressants', 'mood', 'enhancers', 'so', 'long', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'feel', 'when', 'call', 'mother', 'died', 'one-time', 'actor', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'football', 'player', 'television', 'movie', 'everything', 'home', 'New', 'Jersey', 'first', 'time', 'eight', 'years.Largeman', 'may', 'have', 'boarded', 'plane', 'just', 'shirt', 'back', 'Garden', 'State', 'more', 'personal', 'baggage', 'Hilton', 'sisters', 'sleep-over.Garden', 'State', 'writing-directing', 'debut', 'star', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Scrubs', 'finely-', 'tuned', 'character', 'study', 'lot', 'say', 'human', 'condition', 'jokes', 'aside', 'Garden', 'State', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'stagnant', 'late', 'August', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'something', 'say', 'so', 'refreshing', 'off-the-cuff', 'approach', 'film', 'triple', 'threat', 'Braff', 'be', 'commended', 'not', 'just', 'making', 'assured', 'debut', 'camera', 'making', 'film', 'should', 'stand', 'up', 'test', 'time.As', 'film', 'writer', 'was', 'constantly', 'amazed', 'Braff', 'observations', 'depth', 'reference', 'never', 'feel', 'characters', 'only', 'exist', 'confines', 'frame', 'director', 'Braff', 'picked', 'winning', 'cast', 'who', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'one', 'draw', 'Braff', 'world', 'hitting', 'just', 'right', 'pitch', 'match', 'script', 'unique', 'blend', 'dark', 'comedy', 'raw', 'emotion', 'become', 'part', 'world', 'hard', 'leave.Braff', 'peppers', 'script', 'casual', 'insights', 'bits', 'business', 'captivate', 'simplicity', 'honesty', 'are', 'revelations', 'design', ""n't"", 'slap', 'face', 'expose', 'level', 'truth', 'sincerity', 'Garden', 'State', 'inviting', 'may', 'be', 'dysfunctional', 'people', 'least', 'not', 'afraid', 'admit', 'it.Once', 'home', 'Largeman', 'rounds', 'connecting', 'old', 'friends', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'perfectly', 'laid', 'back', 'new', 'loves', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'sweet', 'engaging', 'marginal', 'acquaintances', 'town', 'killed', 'finally', 'settling', 'down', 'much', 'dreaded', 'father-son', 'confrontation', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'appropriately', 'distant', 'patriarch.Braff', 'be', 'admired', 'making', 'film', 'as', 'entertaining', 'thoughtful', 'talent', 'connections', 'have', 'afforded', 'opportunity', 'create', 'rather', 'regurgitate', 'did', ""n't"", 'squander', 'opportunity']",Garden State

It's only at age 26 when his mother dies that he for the first time in 9 years comes back home to New Jersey to attend her funeral. And alot of memories comes with his return. His relation with his parents was never the best, first he was sent away to attend a school then he's been on lithium for depression since he was just a kid that conceal his feelings for love, hate, sadness and anger. While back home he decides to stop taking the medication, re-see some old friends and just relax from the stressy life he got. While at the doctors waiting room he'll meet Sam (Natalie Portman) a free thinker with very special character. Thanks to Sam, he'll eventually  re-discover the beauty of life, love and to finally get Through with some of the feelings about his childhood that he never could with the medication and never dared getting Through with in the first place. Sam gives him courage, joy and makes him eventually realize what life is all about. Natalie Portman is exellent as Sam, she really proves her versability as an acress, having recently seen her in ""V for Vendetta"" also. ""Garden State"" is a cute drama with good plot, character developments and interesting issues that touches the audience. It reminds me of alot of European films with their simplicity but often so rich plots.  It also fot a few memorable scenes not to miss. Other then great performences by Braff (who also wrote, directed and starred in his first lead role) and Porter who's wonderful!, we'll find Ian Holm as Andrew's father, Peter Sarsgaard as one of his friends and Ice Cube in a smaller role.

He plays an actor/waiter in LA who has to return home for his mother's funeral.  Once there, he goes off his antidepressants and meets Natalie Portman, who gives the best performance of a Jersey Girl I've ever seen.

They have focused upon Andrew Largeman's return to his hometown following the death of his mother and his short journey back to himself and the people and circumstances that shook up his life and set him in a direction that will bring him from being numb to feeling life again for the first time in many years.Yes - this is a big part of the film.AND what delighted me more than the plot was the artistry that was exhibited in the story telling.  Actors filled supporting roles and cameo roles with incredible intensity and flavor, take Jean Smart, who played the mother of one of Andrew Largeman's best friends from his home town who now spends his time taking hits from a bong while at home and digging graves while at work.The role of Andrew's father, a Psychiatrist who has medicated his son into a no-feeling state for year-after-year-after-year was admirably played by Ian Holm.There was a woman who sang at the mother's funeral who was SOOOO New Jersey I was amazed: I am not sure of her name but I did love her moments on stage.I was completely wrapped up in the storytelling - I wondered about the metaphors unfolding (such as one with Andrew and Sam sitting on a staircase at an airport with an escalator constantly in motion behind them.)  I wondered: was that on purpose, about movement and life and being stuck in life or am I putting WAYYYY too much into this?I loved watching Andrew come back to life - when talking to his father he said, ""I was a little boy and some one made a sh*tty latch"" - and that latch defined the intervening years of his life and now, now NOW he was choosing differently.I adored ""meeting"" Sam with all her beloved eccentricities - she reminded me of what I imagine my youngest daughter will become - I had to have my eight-year-old daughter watch the scene where Andrew ""witnessed a completely original moment"" and I wondered what would happen if we each became conscious of creating completely original moments?And then there was the surprising geological find... in Newark, NJ and another line I will carry with me forever - ""Have fun exploring the infinite abyss"" and exactly the perfect response, ""You, too.""He could have been speaking to you - or me - or your neighbor, your best friend.I was moved to tears when Andrew began to parent his father, ""We have to work on being OK"" not to fabricate that we were happy.  Very powerful.  What if we all worked on being OK?Zach Braff was incredible - goofy smile and all. Natalie Portman did an incredibly subtle and believable New Jersey accent....(I grew up in NJ, whether or not it makes me an expert is up for question, I suppose.)This movie, obviously, will stick with me.

628804,A4Q2UOVXW9477,B00005JNC2,Justin E. Miller,"[2, 6]","Garden State is the directorial debut of Zach Braff, better known as J.D. on Scrubs, the wildly popular comedy on NBC. Zach plays the lead role of Andrew Largeman, an actor in Hollywood whose biggest role was playing a mentally challenged person on a television show. It was apparent though that he wasn't doing many acting roles as of late since he was working in a Vietnamese restaurant at the start of the movie.Andrew returns home to attend the funeral of his paraplegic mother who drowned, and over the course of a few days, he looks around to notice that while some things change, a lot of it stays the same. It's a clich&egrave;, but the saying ""you can't go home again"" is pretty apparent throughout this movie. Looking around you see all of his friends from high school, save one, are complete losers, and even the one who isn't that invented silent velcro isn't exactly a model citizen. They are all in dead-end jobs and drug and alcohol users.The turnaround point comes when Andrew talks to his father, who is a doctor, about headaches and sets him up with a colleague. In the doctor's office, he meets Sam, who is played by Natalie Portman. I have seen Natalie Portman in quite a few roles, and of all of them, the character she played in this movie is my personal favorite. It turns out that Sam is an epileptic pathological liar with a love for all things animal and works in a law firm. Throughout the movie, the two of them get to know each other better, and strong romantic feelings develop. You can just tell there is chemistry between the two. They find a niche early on and it just seems natural.Among my favorite parts of the movie is in the beginning, when Andrew gives Sam a ride home on the motorcycle, but she refuses to ride in the sidecar, because that would imply she was his bitch. While that was amusing, it was more amusing later in the movie when we see Mark riding in the sidecar.

628805,A2PUVEKTXWPAXC,B00005JNC2,Justin Wilkins,"[7, 15]","Zach Braff, he was on ""Scrubs"" they tell me it was a T.V. show, wrote, directed, and plays Andrew Largeman--affectionately known as Large to his friends--in this offbeat comedy.  The film is similar in both style and story to ""The Graduate"" (A Simon and Garfunkel track is even used at one point) and at times resembles a Wes Anderson film.The film opens with an obvious dream sequence which ends when Large is awakened by a phone call from his father (Ian Holm).  Large's mother has drowned and he most return home for the funeral.  In the next few scenes we learn that his mom was a paraplegic--ahh the plot thickens-- and that he's on a lot of drugs.  In fact, Large is basically in a Lithium induced coma that has made him numb to the world for most of his life. While home he hangs out with old friends who spend their days doing nothing before drinking and drugging away their nights, meets Sam (Natalie Portman) a somewhat strange girl with her own medical problems, and comes to grip with his life/problems.The film moves at a moderately slow, but steady pace and its scored with a superlative soundtrack thats very effective.

628809,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B00005JNC2,kaduzy,"[15, 25]","I am a trailer junkie, I admit it.  When I saw the teaser ad for ""Garden State,"" I fell in love with it.  I downloaded it and watched it literally hundreds of times without ever having seen the movie.  I'm talking about the one that's just images from the film, no dialogue, with that Frou Frou song playing over them.  It moved me to tears, to words beyond speaking.  I simply adored it.But I never had a chance to see the movie in theaters, so when it came out on DVD, I just bought it.  For one thing, I figured that the trailer would be on the DVD, so even if I wound up disliking it, at least I'd have the trailer.  But I wasn't worried.  After all, with a trailer like THAT, how could this film *possibly* be anything but magnificent?Like this:1) *THE TRAILER ISN'T ON THE BLOODY DISC!*  It isn't included with the extras at all!  Not even the regular trailer, much less the one I fell in love with.  This KILLS me.  It's truly devastating.  What in the world were they thinking in excluding it??2) *My big, fat, cliche-filled movie.*  So here's the ""beauty"" of this movie's breakdown: Boy is sad.  Boy meets Girl.  Girl makes Boy happy.  Boy falls in love with Girl and everyone lives kookily ever after.  The End.  This is an overused, entirely tired formula for any movie, but it can work if it's done in a new and interesting way.  (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" for instance, is an excellent example of how this formula can be twisted around and made almost unrecognizably new.)  ""Garden State"" simply fails to make this a new journey for its audience (or at least for me).  I did NOT believe that in four days Natalie Portman's character could have changed him that completely.  I do not believe that she did anything remotely special besides be kute and krazy with a kapital ""K"" for the entire movie that would have endeared anyone to her.  But she's Natalie Portman, so everyone buys it.  Everyone, apparantly, but me.  Aside from that, the cliches made the plot completely predictable.  Anyone who couldn't see from the beginning of that airport sequence that he wasn't going to get onto that plane was probably just in the bathroom when it started.  After all, who WOULD get on a plane to Los Angeles when they can stay in New Jersey and build a relationship with someone they met four days ago?  That makes PERFECT sense.3) *Underdeveloped characters.*  Someone needs to inform M. Braff that a laundry list of ""quirks"" doesn't make someone a character, it just makes them a random person with quirks.  Portman played an epileptic girl who ice skates in alligator suits and buries hamsters and makes weird faces at weird moments.  Peter Sarsgaard was a pot-smoking grave-digger who stole things from dead bodies and hung out with odd people.  Few explanations are offered for any of these behaviors; they are just presented to the audience and people are expected to respond.  I resepct the choice to leave some things open and let the audience make up its own mind about certain aspects of character, but what I cannot accept is caricatures as opposed to well-developed characters.  I think Braff gets away with this primarily because of the actors he has chosen for these roles.  Portman and especially Sarsgaard are both such amazing talents that it's almost impossible to see how little they've really been given to work with in the way of character development from the script.  Maybe I've just spent too many hours analyzing movies as a film major, but I did see it, and I would like to register my disappointment formally.Braff's character was also really unbelievable to me.  If he was so drugged up and zoned out for so many years that he couldn't even bring himself to express normal emotions, then why in the world would he have the desire to become an ACTOR?  Additionally, I thought Ian Holm was wasted in the role of the father.  If you have Ian Holm in your movie, then dammit, you freakin' USE Ian Holm in your movie.  There are some deleted scenes with him that give us a bit more insight into his completely one-dimensional character, but even if they HAD been included, it wouldn't have been enough to overcome this fundamental problem.The one positive thing I CAN say about this DVD presentation is that at least Braff didn't waste his commentary tracks.  He has two, which seems to be a bit excessive, but he manages to avoid repetition for the most part.  He doesn't offer any insights into the failings of his script, but I didn't expect that anyway.  :-)I gave it two stars because in spite of the fact that I didn't really like this movie, I have to admit that it isn't TERRIBLE.  If I had paid $8 to see it in theaters, I would have felt just fine about it, and I wouldn't have felt my money was wasted.  But I never would have bought it on DVD.  Since I did shell out $20 for the DVD and don't plan to watch it over and over again to get my money's worth, I DO feel that my money was wasted, but I guess I can live with that.  Braff obviously has a lot of talent, and I look forward to seeing what else he can come up with.  Maybe his next script won't have the same ""I wrote this as my film school thesis"" gleam to it and will be a bit more mature, and a hell of a lot more believable.",2,"Overrated, hate to say it.

628814,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B00005JNC2,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","The first half hour of Zack Braff&#8217;s debut as a writer and director establishes him as a filmmaker of immense talent, and I hope he&#8217;ll get to make more films soon.  It's opening act high captures a youthful sense of upper-middle class depression, alienation and ennui as well as I&#8217;ve seen, with comedy that makes you hurt inside, and inventive visual story telling.After that the film comes down to earth somewhat, but it&#8217;s still full of goodies. Peter Saarsgaurd in particular creates an unforgettable supporting character while being complexly understated.This story of an depressed actor in his late 20s returning home after 9 years has a lovely mix of quirky humor, and well-earned sadness. Braff satirizes small town America without putting it down, and pokes fun at depression and family tragedy without it feeling shallow - neither very easy feats.  Great use of music as well.Where the film falters for me is in the love story, which feels bizarrely familiar and unimaginative compared to the storytelling  all around it.  Also, while both fine actors, I never really felt any great chemistry between Braff and Natalie Portman.  In some ways Braff's relationship with Saarsguard feels more nuanced. Last, Portman&#8217;s character feels so young, so unformed next to Braff that it&#8217;s hard to believe she&#8217;s ready for a serious relationship.The very end has received some justifiable carping from critics as a bit of a cop out, but it didn&#8217;t bother me nearly as much as such things usually do.But all that said, this is a terrific debut film, and a terrific film about being young and lost.",4,Impressive first feature,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,1636,"['first', 'hour', 'Zack', 'Braff', '8217', 'debut', 'writer', 'director', 'establishes', 'filmmaker', 'immense', 'talent', 'hope', '8217', 'get', 'make', 'more', 'films', 'soon', 'opening', 'act', 'high', 'captures', 'youthful', 'sense', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'depression', 'alienation', 'ennui', 'as', 'well', '8217', 've', 'seen', 'comedy', 'hurt', 'inventive', 'visual', 'story', 'telling.After', 'film', 'down', 'earth', 'somewhat', '8217', 'still', 'full', 'goodies', 'Peter', 'Saarsgaurd', 'particular', 'creates', 'unforgettable', 'supporting', 'character', 'being', 'complexly', 'understated.This', 'story', 'depressed', 'actor', 'late', '20s', 'returning', 'home', '9', 'years', 'lovely', 'mix', 'quirky', 'humor', 'well-earned', 'sadness', 'Braff', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'putting', 'down', 'fun', 'depression', 'family', 'tragedy', 'feeling', 'shallow', 'very', 'easy', 'feats', 'Great', 'use', 'music', 'well.Where', 'film', 'falters', 'love', 'story', 'bizarrely', 'familiar', 'unimaginative', 'compared', 'storytelling', 'Also', 'fine', 'actors', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Braff', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'ways', 'Braff', 'relationship', 'Saarsguard', 'feels', 'more', 'nuanced', 'Last', 'Portman', '8217', 's', 'character', 'feels', 'so', 'young', 'so', 'unformed', 'next', 'Braff', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'believe', '8217', 'ready', 'serious', 'relationship.The', 'very', 'end', 'received', 'justifiable', 'carping', 'critics', 'bit', 'cop', 'out', '8217', 'bother', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'such', 'things', 'usually', 'do.But', 'said', 'terrific', 'debut', 'film', 'terrific', 'film', 'being', 'young', 'lost']",Garden State

628817,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JNC2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 6]","Our introduction to Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) after seeing him calmly sitting in the middle seat on an airplane that is apparently going down is to see him lying in a white bed in a white room looking like he is almost catatonic.  When the phone rings he does not answer it and we here a voice that turns out to be his father who has called to inform Andrew that his mother has drowned the previous night in the bathtub.  Although it has been years, Andrew will go home for the funeral and for the experience he decides not to take any of the pills in all of the neatly arranged bottles on the shelf in his medicine cabinet.  Clearly the drugs have something to do with his mother and by not taking them Andrew ensures that he will arrive back in New Jersey in a different state of mind.In good time we will find out why Andrews' father (Ian Holm) has been proscribing drugs all these years.  The relationship between father and son is one of the ways we can gauge the progress that Andrew is making in the film as he finds his own voice again.  We also learn that despite being overmedicated Andrews is a would-be actor who has managed to score a gig as a retarded quarterback in some sort of cable movie.  This means that every time he runs into somebody back home it becomes clear they are going to mention the movie, comment on how long it has been since they have seen Andrew, and say something about his mother being dead.I keep hearing that ""Garden State"" is ""The Graduate"" for this generation, but instead of seeing young Dustin Hoffman I keep thinking young Ray Romano (heavily sedated on drugs) every time I see Andrew.  I get the idea the film is also about growing up when you do not want to, but since Andrew does not sleep with Sam's mother there are some significant differences.  One of the problems of ""Garden State"" is that the character arc is basically Andrew waking up.  The movie petty much has to end when Andrew gets to the point that his eyes are finally open all the way, and that is basically what happens.  The other problem is the love story between Andrew and Sam (Natalie Portman), simply because the reason Sam likes Andrew is that Zach Braff, who plays Andrew, also wrote and directed the film.  So either the relationship only works because it is simply written that way or Sam puts a lot of faith in the opinion of a dog.  You decide.What Andrew discovers when he gets home is that while his life is pretty sad none of his old friends and acquaintances are doing any better.  He might think that his life does not make sense, but then he runs into Kenny, Jesse, Mark and a bunch of other guys he went to high school with and it is clear he is doing better than most.  This helps him start to get his mind wrapped around the idea that his glass might be half full instead of half empty, and we await either his final epiphany or for the character to crash and burn (remember the airplane bit at the beginning?).  At least with ""Garden State"" we know it can legitimately go either way.""Garden State"" is more different than it is brilliant, which is what makes it stand out as an example of Independent filmmaking.  If you do not cotton to its Indy sensibilities and sense of humor, then there is a good chance this film will not click for you.  This is a film where what is considered funny are things like ordering bread in a Vietnamese restaurant, a hamster too dumb to figure out the rolling wheel, a couple living on a boat at the bottom of a quarry, and returning knives without a receipt.  ""Garden State"" is a dark comedy, stopping well short of being a black comedy, but just like eating chocolate some people will find it to be to dark to enjoy.  But Braff gets major props for including ""One Of These Things First"" by Nick Drake in the soundtrack.",4,Zach Braff's film of a young man finally waking up to life,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,3792,"['introduction', 'Andrew', 'Largeman', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'seeing', 'calmly', 'sitting', 'middle', 'seat', 'airplane', 'apparently', 'going', 'down', 'see', 'lying', 'white', 'bed', 'white', 'room', 'looking', 'almost', 'catatonic', 'When', 'phone', 'rings', 'not', 'answer', 'here', 'voice', 'out', 'be', 'father', 'who', 'called', 'inform', 'Andrew', 'mother', 'drowned', 'previous', 'night', 'bathtub', 'been', 'years', 'Andrew', 'will', 'go', 'home', 'funeral', 'experience', 'not', 'take', 'pills', 'neatly', 'arranged', 'bottles', 'shelf', 'medicine', 'cabinet', 'Clearly', 'drugs', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'mother', 'not', 'taking', 'Andrew', 'will', 'arrive', 'back', 'New', 'Jersey', 'different', 'state', 'mind.In', 'good', 'time', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Andrews', 'father', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'been', 'proscribing', 'drugs', 'years', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'one', 'ways', 'can', 'gauge', 'progress', 'Andrew', 'making', 'film', 'own', 'voice', 'again', 'also', 'learn', 'being', 'overmedicated', 'Andrews', 'would-be', 'actor', 'who', 'managed', 'score', 'gig', 'retarded', 'quarterback', 'sort', 'cable', 'movie', 'time', 'somebody', 'back', 'home', 'clear', 'are', 'going', 'mention', 'movie', 'comment', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'have', 'seen', 'Andrew', 'say', 'something', 'mother', 'being', 'dead.I', 'keep', 'hearing', 'Garden', 'State', 'Graduate', 'generation', 'instead', 'seeing', 'young', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'keep', 'thinking', 'young', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'heavily', 'sedated', 'drugs', 'time', 'see', 'Andrew', 'get', 'idea', 'film', 'also', 'about', 'growing', 'up', 'when', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'Andrew', 'not', 'sleep', 'Sam', 'mother', 'are', 'significant', 'differences', 'One', 'problems', 'Garden', 'State', 'character', 'arc', 'basically', 'Andrew', 'waking', 'up', 'movie', 'petty', 'much', 'end', 'when', 'Andrew', 'point', 'eyes', 'are', 'finally', 'open', 'way', 'basically', 'what', 'other', 'problem', 'love', 'story', 'Andrew', 'Sam', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'simply', 'reason', 'Sam', 'Andrew', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'who', 'Andrew', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'relationship', 'only', 'simply', 'written', 'way', 'Sam', 'lot', 'faith', 'opinion', 'dog', 'decide.What', 'Andrew', 'discovers', 'when', 'home', 'life', 'pretty', 'sad', 'none', 'old', 'friends', 'acquaintances', 'are', 'doing', 'better', 'might', 'think', 'life', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'then', 'Kenny', 'Jesse', 'Mark', 'bunch', 'other', 'guys', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'clear', 'doing', 'better', 'most', 'start', 'get', 'mind', 'wrapped', 'idea', 'glass', 'might', 'be', 'half', 'full', 'instead', 'half', 'empty', 'await', 'final', 'epiphany', 'character', 'crash', 'burn', 'remember', 'airplane', 'bit', 'beginning', 'least', 'Garden', 'State', 'know', 'can', 'legitimately', 'go', 'way', 'Garden', 'State', 'more', 'different', 'brilliant', 'what', 'stand', 'out', 'example', 'Independent', 'filmmaking', 'do', 'not', 'cotton', 'Indy', 'sensibilities', 'sense', 'humor', 'then', 'good', 'chance', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'click', 'film', 'where', 'what', 'considered', 'funny', 'are', 'things', 'ordering', 'bread', 'Vietnamese', 'restaurant', 'hamster', 'too', 'dumb', 'figure', 'out', 'rolling', 'wheel', 'couple', 'living', 'boat', 'bottom', 'quarry', 'returning', 'knives', 'receipt', 'Garden', 'State', 'dark', 'comedy', 'stopping', 'well', 'short', 'being', 'black', 'comedy', 'just', 'eating', 'chocolate', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'dark', 'enjoy', 'Braff', 'major', 'props', 'including', 'One', 'Things', 'First', 'Nick', 'Drake', 'soundtrack']",Garden State

The theme that emerges, once you get to know the characters and their history well enough to put it all in perspective, is that the main character was damaged by psychiatric drugs all his life, his father being a psychiatrist who thought he knew what he was doing.When he was a little boy, our hero lost patience with his constantly complaining mom, and gave her a push.  She fell over something, injured herself, and spent the rest of her life crippled.  In response, the father put the kid on prescription drugs, his way of saying that the boy was dangerous and out of control.  The ""fact"" is that it was just an accident, and the little boy was not dangerous or out of control.  The mother was extremely annoying, so much so that she got her son to give her a little push out of frustration.Years passed, and then the woman accidentally drowned in her own bathtub.  Again, the father would want that to seem like the son's fault, for that push he gave his mom so many years ago.  He wouldn't want to take the blame on himself.  Personally I think he should have had a talk with his wife way back then, letting her know how inconsiderate it is to be complaining all the time.  If he had given her enough verbal pushes, maybe the child wouldn't have had to give a physical push.The father is ponderous.  By the end of the movie you realize what a villain he is.  Fortunately, most of the movie leaves him out of it.  It follows the son and his friends.His most interesting friend is Natalie Portman, a young woman with an odd sense of humor that has her making up tall tales.  Much is made of her being a ""liar"", but I don't see it that way.  Is a comedian called a liar for telling stories?  Once you accept the fact that Natalie's character enjoys putting people on with tall tales, I don't see a problem with it.  I'm fine with her sense of humor.  Can you only be considered a comic if you are getting paid for it?  Is a stage the only place you are allowed to put people on?One drawback of this film is that since the main character is supposed to be drugged into numbness, how do you make him interesting to watch?

628824,A25ACLV5KPB4W,B00005JNC2,"Matt Hetling ""Matt""","[2, 2]","This movie hangs on the understated performance of Zach Braff, who travels back to his small town home after his mother dies to deal with her death and his father, a psychiatrist who has kept Andrew (Braff) on lithium since he was 9 years old.The emotionally numb Andrew is coming off of his medication for the first time since he was a boy, and he meets Natalie Portman, a quirky girl who seems to love him. The film basically tracks Andrew as he spends time with high school friends and tries to come to grips with his mother's death.This sounds like a depressing movie, but it's really not. The emphasis is on the eccentricities, and unexplored corners, of small town life.  Something about this set of offbeat small-town characters is more realistic than the traditional Hollywood paean to the wackiness of rural life. Everyone has problems, and there's nothing cute or empowering about a grave-digging buddy who makes a habit of making off with the jewelry of the corpses he buries.The dialogue is particularly well done, with lots of unfinished thoughts, interrupted conversations, ""likes"" and ""you knows"" combining to make the interactions seem very real.For all the serious subject matter, this is actually an uplifting movie, with plenty of very funny comedic scenes that make and happy spots to make us feel good. One scene in particular, featuring a Medieval Times Knight who romances his friend's mother in Klingon, is very funny.This is the kind of movie that abounds in independent film, but which has combined art and realism with the commercial value and production value that make it viable for a major studio to get behind it.

That is about it.  I was excited to see this movie, but when I did, I found it disappointing.First of all, the acting in this movie is not that great.  Braff's character of Largeman in the movie is supposed to be an actor, but it is laughable that the constantly sedated character could ever be even a bad actor because the character has no personality whatsoever.  I like Braff's character on Scrubs, but I don't think he hit the mark in this movie.  Portman's acting isn't that great either and I agree that her character is pretty annoying.Secondly, the plot of the movie is stupid.  Largeman's mother became a quadraplegic by hitting her head on the dishwasher and later died by drowning.  These events are even less believed when Braff describes them in his sedated state.  And the romance between Braff and Portman plain and boring.  Finally, I don't really know what the whole point of them going down into a gorge was and way it was a big deal that they stood at the edge and screamed.  It was not a pivitol point in the movie, it was lackluster.There were so many things that I wanted to happen in this movie that just didn't happen. It sounded so promising, but unfortunatley it was disappointing.  I think that my only favorate part was that one character in the movie collected Desert Storm trading cards.

Although the acting is quite good and the cinematography is excellent; you're going to have to like romantic comedies to enjoy this flick. Look also for a good performance by Ian Holm.When the action starts, a young man named Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returns home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral after being estranged from his family for nine years. Andrew has been moderately successful as an actor in California; but he is largely tormented by the pills his psychiatrist father gives him to keep him calm, or, as Andrew puts it, ""numb."" At the funeral (and after) Andrew meets up with some old buddies Mark, Dave and Jesse (Peter Sarsgaard, Alex Burns and Armando Riesco, respectively). They have some mildly fun times; but things go in a whole new direction for Andrew when he meets Samantha (Natalie Portman).Samantha and Andrew befriend each other and slowly Samantha's warmth and natural charm make Andrew feel true emotions again; this is helped in part by Andrew's going off his medication for the first time in many years. Although Andrew feels some pain and there are ups and downs with Sam, he slowly begins to trust her and they being together as friends.Of course, things get more complicated. What would happen if Samantha and Andrew start a romance and Andrew decides to go back to California? After all, he's only been in New Jersey four days when he has to return to his job in California. In addition, Andrew and his father (Ian Holm) have unfinished business to clear up between them--how will that work? And what about Andrew's guilt about an accident with his mother? No plot spoilers here, folks--get the movie and find out!The DVD comes with deleted scenes, ""blooper"" scenes, a running commentary by Zach Braff and Natalie Portman, the ""making of"" extra--and more. That's very good.Garden State is truly a film for those of us who like romantic comedies. I'm not especially wild about this genre; although I will admit that Garden State is one of the better romantic comedies out there. The acting is quite convincing; Natalie Portman shines on the screen.

The movie is a little uneven - some of the scenes do not work as well as others. Overall, though, it is a satisfying delight. And I doubt any recent movie addresses the angst of contemporary twentysomethings as well as this one does.Andrew Largeman [Braff] is an aspiring actor living in Los Angeles. He works as a waiter in a trendy restaurant. He hasn't been home to New Jersey in nine years, but when his wheelchair-bound Mom dies, he has no choice but to return. There, he reunites uncomfortably with his psychiatrist father [Ian Holm]. He meets up with his childhood buddies, most of who seem to have met dead ends in life. The one who has `succeeded' by making a fortune has found a dead end of his own. Along the way, Andrew meets a very unique girl [Natalie Portman]. Something in her awakens a part of him, something which, because of his very unfortunate childhood, has long been dormant. But is it too late? Can Andrew, who has survived on anti-depressants and therapy for a dozen years, break free and become himself for the first time?The cast is sublime and manages to override all of the mostly minor script deficiencies.

A guy comes home because his mother drowned and died and while back he meets some of his old friends, has to confront his psychiatrist father who has been medicating him since the age of 10.

Well anyway I started watching it and I kept waiting for the plot to pick up and it didn't. Now generally I like indie movies that don't have much of a plot. I enjoyed Napoleon Dynamite, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Real Women Have Curves, and Tart. None of those movies had serious 'action-packed' plots, and they all could have been about real people's lives. So since this movie falls into the same genre I thought for sure I would like it. Well I was wrong. The overuse of the word 'f***' and all the drug use just seems like it was added in to make the movie more interesting. There is no depth to the characters, they are one-sided and you cannot feel any emotion for them whatsoever.

Braff's character, Andrew, is a small-time actor in L.A. who returns to his home state of New Jersey following the death of his mother. Andrew's emotions are in high gear and he passes the time by hanging out with some old school buddies (including the very talented Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Mark) and beginning a tentative relationship with a slightly crazy girl (Natalie Portman) who somehow brings him comfort.Braff, Sarsgaard, and the rest of the cast of ""Garden State"" are amazing in this film, but Portman steals the show with her hilarious performance as Sam.

628837,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JNC2,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 3]","Garden State is actually a drug trip movie in reverse.  Whereas other movies about drug addiction subject the viewer through the insanity of hallucinations, silly antics, and run-ins with the law, Garden State starts out in the doldrums of a barbiturate-induced malaise.  Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) wanders aimlessly through life, suffering from a recurring nightmare that he's on a plane that's about to crash.  While everyone screams, ""Large"" just turns up the air.  That pretty much sums up his life.The death of Andrew's mother calls him home to New Jersey (Garden State, get it), and it's only then that the pieces start to fit together.  A quadriplegic, Mrs. Largeman and Andrew have a bitter past.  It doesn't help that his father, Gideon (the magnificent Ian Holm) alternately blames Andrew for his mother's condition and coldly distances himself from his son.  The confrontation between them is a long time coming.Along the way, Andrew reconnects with all of his old friends in Jersey.  It's not a particularly flattering portrayal. They're all in service roles, be it outrageously offensive police officers, meandering stoner gravediggers, or knights for the Medieval Times dinner restaurant.  Okay, that last job is cool.  But the character is a jerk.It seems that Andrew didn't miss much.  While he was on mind-altering medication as a struggling actor in Los Angeles, his friends (and in at least one case, his friends' mom) are all toking up in the mansion of a guy who invented ""silent Velcro.""  And yet, with all that money, all they do is waste it away getting high.Thankfully, that fate is not for Andrew.  Away from his drugs for the first time in his life, he begins to wake up and the audience is encouraged to wake up with him.  The film's music, dialogue, and camera angles shift from dreamy floating sequences to a much snappier pace.  It almost makes suffering along with Andrew worth it.The turning point is the arrival of Sam, played by Natalie Portman.  An inveterate pixie of a liar, she comes from a wacky household where burying pets (in the pet graveyard, of course) is a sacred obligation.  Fans of Portman always knew she could act, but Garden State forcefully reminds us as she ranges from timid vulnerability to passionate love, from heart wrenching sorrow to boundless joy. She turns Sam into a living, breathing woman and a worthy counterpart to the not-quite-awake Andrew.In between, a lot of things don't happen.  Andrew avoids his father but visits the bathtub where his mother drowned.  The question as to whether or not her death was a suicide is left hanging--except in the special features, where the confrontation between father and son is fleshed out.  They go to a lot of parties, visit some wacky characters, and go on a quest for a treasure at the bottom of an Abyss (Braf played Dungeons & Dragons, I can tell).Garden State's biggest flaw is that it wants to be an art film, a tale of redemption, a coming of age story, a father/son weeper, a small town homage, and a music video.  Because Braff also wrote and directed, his artist sensibilities are perpetually at war with what makes for a good story...and it's all on screen.  The beginning is slow and meandering, but that's on purpose and appropriate for an art film.  It doesn't make for a compelling story though.  The ending is forced and more than a little odd--there's a feint at a different ending, dancing at the edge of art-house sensibilities, only to pull back at the last second.  Which is a good thing too, because otherwise we'd end up with the same kind of non-ending as Lost in Translation.Ultimately, Garden State is about that verdant state of being in every one of us, the child who has no idea his actions will have repercussions for the rest of his life.  Returning to that raw human condition of love, hate, vulnerability and strength, elevates Garden State to more than just a hokey hometown film.",4,More than just a hokey hometown film,1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,3926,"['Garden', 'State', 'actually', 'drug', 'trip', 'movie', 'reverse', 'other', 'movies', 'drug', 'addiction', 'subject', 'viewer', 'insanity', 'hallucinations', 'silly', 'antics', 'run-ins', 'law', 'Garden', 'State', 'out', 'doldrums', 'barbiturate-induced', 'malaise', 'Andrew', 'Largeman', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'wanders', 'aimlessly', 'life', 'suffering', 'recurring', 'nightmare', 'plane', 'crash', 'everyone', 'screams', 'Large', 'just', 'up', 'air', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'life.The', 'death', 'Andrew', 'mother', 'home', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Garden', 'State', 'get', 'only', 'then', 'pieces', 'start', 'fit', 'together', 'quadriplegic', 'Mrs.', 'Largeman', 'Andrew', 'have', 'bitter', 'past', ""n't"", 'help', 'father', 'Gideon', 'magnificent', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'alternately', 'Andrew', 'mother', 'condition', 'coldly', 'distances', 'son', 'confrontation', 'long', 'time', 'coming.Along', 'way', 'Andrew', 'old', 'friends', 'Jersey', 'not', 'particularly', 'flattering', 'portrayal', ""'re"", 'service', 'roles', 'be', 'outrageously', 'offensive', 'police', 'officers', 'meandering', 'stoner', 'gravediggers', 'knights', 'Medieval', 'Times', 'dinner', 'restaurant', 'Okay', 'last', 'job', 'cool', 'character', 'jerk.It', 'Andrew', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'much', 'was', 'mind-altering', 'medication', 'struggling', 'actor', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'friends', 'least', 'one', 'case', 'friends', 'mom', 'are', 'toking', 'up', 'mansion', 'guy', 'who', 'invented', 'silent', 'Velcro', 'yet', 'money', 'do', 'waste', 'away', 'getting', 'high.Thankfully', 'fate', 'not', 'Andrew', 'Away', 'drugs', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'wake', 'up', 'audience', 'encouraged', 'wake', 'up', 'film', 'music', 'dialogue', 'camera', 'angles', 'shift', 'dreamy', 'floating', 'sequences', 'much', 'snappier', 'pace', 'almost', 'suffering', 'along', 'Andrew', 'it.The', 'turning', 'point', 'arrival', 'Sam', 'played', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'inveterate', 'pixie', 'liar', 'wacky', 'household', 'where', 'burying', 'pets', 'pet', 'graveyard', 'course', 'sacred', 'obligation', 'Fans', 'Portman', 'always', 'knew', 'could', 'act', 'Garden', 'State', 'forcefully', 'timid', 'vulnerability', 'passionate', 'love', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'sorrow', 'boundless', 'joy', 'Sam', 'living', 'breathing', 'woman', 'worthy', 'counterpart', 'not-quite-awake', 'Andrew.In', 'lot', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Andrew', 'father', 'bathtub', 'where', 'mother', 'drowned', 'question', 'not', 'death', 'was', 'suicide', 'left', 'hanging', 'special', 'features', 'where', 'confrontation', 'father', 'son', 'fleshed', 'out', 'go', 'lot', 'parties', 'visit', 'wacky', 'characters', 'go', 'quest', 'treasure', 'bottom', 'Abyss', 'Braf', 'played', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'can', 'tell', '.Garden', 'State', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'be', 'art', 'film', 'tale', 'redemption', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'father/son', 'weeper', 'small', 'town', 'homage', 'music', 'video', 'Braff', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'artist', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'perpetually', 'war', 'what', 'good', 'story', 'screen', 'beginning', 'slow', 'meandering', 'purpose', 'appropriate', 'art', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'compelling', 'story', 'ending', 'forced', 'more', 'little', 'odd', 'feint', 'different', 'ending', 'dancing', 'edge', 'art-house', 'sensibilities', 'only', 'pull', 'back', 'last', 'second', 'Which', 'good', 'thing', 'too', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'end', 'up', 'same', 'kind', 'non-ending', 'Lost', 'Translation.Ultimately', 'Garden', 'State', 'verdant', 'state', 'being', 'one', 'child', 'who', 'idea', 'actions', 'will', 'have', 'repercussions', 'rest', 'life', 'Returning', 'raw', 'human', 'condition', 'love', 'hate', 'vulnerability', 'strength', 'Garden', 'State', 'more', 'just', 'hokey', 'hometown', 'film']",Garden State
628838,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JNC2,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[3, 7]","Progressing from the rather limited realm of television productions to the far more expansive universe of major motion pictures can be quite an overwhelming experience for any aspiring young performer, as some have found out the hard way. The cast members of Friends, for example, with the exception of Miss Jennifer Aniston of course, have had little in the way of success making the transition - David Schwimmer has had no box office hits, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow have each at least one cult classic (in spite of both being ruined by their unnecessary sequels - when will Hollywood learn), Matt LeBlanc had the Charlie's Angels franchise (though he was never featured prominently), and Courtney Cox made the best with both the Scream franchise and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (all of this in spite of the fact that she is married to David Arquette). Is it so much a mystery now as to why they demanded so much money per episode in the final season? They knew they would not be finding much in the way of work after the show ended. Sure there are success stories, but those who take make the leap gamble their future career opportunities in Hollywood.The story follows a man coming to grips with who he is and where his life is going following the death of his mother. Andrew Largeman did not live a carefree childhood back in his home state of New Jersey. Following an incident when he was young where he pushed his mother, causing her to be placed in a wheelchair for the rest of her life, his father, a psychiatrist, ships him off to boarding school. He also prescribes to him dozens of anti-depressant medications which cause him to feel numb to the world around him. Now a moderately successful actor, Andrew makes the decision to go cold-turkey off the prescription drugs he has taken for fifteen years and return home to reconcile not only with his estranged father but also with himself following the death of his mother in a bathtub. In the short time he spends back in New Jersey, he reconnects with all his old friends who have each gone their separate ways in the world and meets Sam, a girl who is everything that he isn't, who teaches him how to open himself up to the world. The story for Garden State, albeit adequately endowed with the comprehensive themes relative to the condition of the human spirit and the adolescent reflections upon life its key demographic necessitates, remains lax in terms of the script's focus and direction. Braff is hell-bent on presenting to his audience every little quirk and peculiarity he can recall about the state of New Jersey, some of which were well established long before this film came out, so much so that blowback occurs where in the pacing within the more somber moments of the movie feel way off from the rest of the picture. Another fortuitous result of these eccentric occurrences is that Garden State develops this tendency toward creating transitional sequences, most notably the one in which Method Man cameos as the operator of peeping-tom business in the back of a hotel, which serve no purpose in stimulating the storyline and only adds further hindrance to the movie's moderate pacing.For what it is worth, acclamation should be given to Zach Braff for a valiant effort in soliciting the responsibility of acting not only as the film's screenwriter and director but its leading man as well, all of which were firsts for him with Garden State. As anyone who has ever embarked on such a cinematic challenge of the limits of both patience and ambition, even for those not in their initial effort, can tell you, achieving the proper tone and style in which to win over the audience is an intricate balancing act so rarely achieved in the modern mainstream Hollywood environment. With that in mind, Braff's efforts in the role of Andrew Largeman, the protagonist of the picture, are like those of the character himself in that they are only moderately successful. Specific scenes opposite Portman or Holm in which they are seen interacting with each other through a segment of honest dialogue successfully demonstrates his proficiency in bringing out the intensity within his character, but at the same time fails to properly illustrate to his audience the dramatic shift in emotions Andrew experiences from the beginning to the end of the movie. Not to say that he should be seen on the floor near the end balling his eyes out but at least show some variance from the insipid, melancholic countenance expressed through nearly the entire picture. Natalie Portman gleams with this illuminating radiance in the role of Sam, the romantic interest of Andrew Largeman, and is suited perfectly opposite Braff in the charming subplot of the film, though it was felt as if this portion of the screenplay could have been expanded upon earlier rather then later in the picture, but in any case it works out fine. Though this is certainly not what one would consider as being Oscar-caliber material in the sense, still if Julia Roberts could be nominated for her rather simplistic role in Pretty Woman then anything is possible - as long as you play a hooker that is, she is a treasure to watch onscreen in this film nonetheless.Ian Holm, the brilliantly talented British actor more commonly remembered for his recent appearance as Bilbo Baggins in the highly successful Lord of the Rings trilogy, is greatly underutilized in the role of Andrew's father, Gideon Largeman. The rather intense interactions and conversational engagements held between Holm and Braff sprinkled sporadically throughout the film are intriguing and poignantly insightful into how divergent the relationship between father and son can become as a result of elevated variant emotions in regards to a single incident involving a loved one. The lack of development within this specific element of the screenplay is truly what made the end result of Garden State all the more disappointing to witness. Time would have been better spent concentrating on the elaboration of the anguish and resentment held for each other which has brought their relationship to a head at this point in their lives, rather then the mindless quirks of the town's residents. Speaking of which, Jean Smart's Carol (Mark's mother) and Armando Riesco's Jesse (a friend of Andrew's whose newfound wealth has stemmed from his creation of the silent Velcro) are two within the film's cast of quirky characters that should have been given something more valuable to do that would have merited their time and involvement in the project or else cut out entirely.Overall, in regards to the emotions Garden State invokes, it would appear as though art does imitate life - the intense anguish and sadness it produces from the prospects of what might have been make it nearly unbearable at times, but when all is said and done you do not regret having taken the ride. Putting it more sincerely, Garden State is not exactly a fantastic film, but there are enough memorable moments contained in it to make it at least recommended for someone else to watch. The film's most egregious oversight would unquestionably have to be its ending, which comes off as being half-assed and anti-climatic to audience members unreceptive to ludicrous clich&eacute;s. Sensing perchance that he could not tangibly achieve the ""happily ever after"" outcome that both he and his audience naively desired with the direction in which the story was heading toward, Braff in total disregard to the characters he created rashly ties up all the loose plot elements instead of allowing them be who they are. Although there is nothing unethical about using maledictions and nudity in movies, within reason of course, a complexity does arise when these are used in excess of what is necessary. And what was with Andrew Largeman going completely cold-turkey on the anti-psychotic medication his father prescribed for him? Having taken what would seem to be an exuberant amount of prescriptions for over fifteen, had he never heard of medical withdrawal? This is not a huge sticking point but realistically speaking this would not have been feasible and should not be recommended for anyone on with such considerable prescriptions. Instead the larger deliberation lies in what is presumed to be Braff's assumption which is that anti-depressant medication has made people numb to the world around them and that it has done far more harm then good, admirable their intentions or not. Although one can certainly argue that the modern generation has evolved into a society which has sought quick-fix solutions to their problems through prescription medication with little, if any, risk of side-effects, it would flat-out ignorant to believe all are unnecessary. Sure, there are those who take this medication for a condition they do not have, there is always a bad apple somewhere in the bunch, but a majority of them do need these prescriptions, in combination with psychological therapy, in order to restore the balance of their lives. And yes, there are no guarantees and uncertainties do occur in which the person may be placed in a high stress environment, but these risks need to be taken in order to reclaim a role in functional society. As much as we would like to, we can not logically shun away the world whenever we are hurt emotionally, or even physically, so we must learn to overcome these hindrances and move on with life, one way

It's about this twenty something guy who returns home, after many years, when he finds that his mother has died.

There is a nice blend of drama and comedy through out the film. Some of the film will bring a small smile to your face, but other parts will have you laughing out loud.

628842,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JNC2,mirasreviews,"[1, 3]","""Garden State"" is a quirky Generation-Y love story written, directed, and starring Zach Braff. Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returns to his hometown in New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral after a 9-year absence. Overmedicated since he was 10 years old by his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm) for problems that may never have existed, Andrew decides to go without his meds for the trip. He catches up with old high school friends and meets an eccentric, talkative woman named Samantha (Natalie Portman) whose unusual ways of coping with her own problems might be the perfect match for him.""Garden State"" is one of those films that is populated with idiosyncratic characters. Fortunately, most of them are not written over the top or overplayed. Peter Sarsgaard is almost too good an actor for his role as Andrew's old friend, Mark. It's nice to see him, but his performance begs for a meatier role. Jean Smart has a couple of good scenes as Mark's mother. Ian Holm mostly creates an impression, rather than a character, as Andrew's father, because he has so little to do. This supporting cast is so impressive that it left me feeling that their talent had been underutilized. But Zach Braff's Andrew and Natalie Portman's Samantha (Sam) are the film's focus. Andrew is a quiet, introverted, slightly dweeby man who tends to view life from the outside looking in. Sam has so many eccentricities that it stretched credibility and became a little annoying. I found her childlike nature to be particularly odd and unlikely -or, if not unlikely, at least unattractive. The character is a mish-mash of too many things and would benefit from some paring down. But ""Garden State"" belongs to the genre of ""quirky love stories"", and that is what it delivers. Many of the film's best moments are found in its absurdist humor. The love story is sweet. And the characters are distinctive.The DVD: Bonus features include 16 deleted scenes with optional commentary, a making-of documentary, outtakes/bloopers, a ""Soundtrack Promo Spot"", and 2 audio commentaries. ""The Making of Garden State"" (27 minutes) is a loosely organized documentary that features short interviews with the film's producers, cast, principal crew, and even the craft service guy. I can't say that its very informative. There is more information on making the film in the audio commentaries. The first audio commentary is by writer/director/actor Zach Braff and actress Natalie Portman. It primarily discusses filming from the point of view of an actor or a director dealing with actors, not technical aspects of filming. The second audio commentary is by Zach Braff, director of photography Lawrence Sher, editor Myron Kerstein, and production designer Judy Becker. Discussion of the technical aspects of filming are in this commentary. Both commentaries are casual but interesting, without long lulls between remarks. If you listen to only one, I recommend the second, technical, commentary, which is a little more engaging and substantive. Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish.

628845,A2XVA2OGDYKKD,B00005JNC2,Monsieur Valentine,"[2, 2]","There are some really artful moments captured by Braff, whilst Andrew's friends seek to null themselves in drugs he inversely begins to wake from such a state.The story goes on to resolve a number of important issues for Andrew, during which, Braff makes it clear that everyone around him suffers a similar fate. Everyone around him deals with issues of their own. In hindsight, its a simple story blown up to chaotic proportions, but I guess that is the story of many people from a higher socioeconomic background. It deals with suffering of the western man. Baff makes contrast of this with the ""african brother"" who's life struggles and accomplishments could put all of them to shame. Its a realization that goes begging... to each is their own I guess, for a state of depression is a curse just as awful as any other misfortune. Anyone who has suffered from it, can tell you this.There are many concepts to be drawn from this movie, which I found quite intruiging. However, I wish Andrew's life had not involved a tragic childhood experience and strong medicated drugs (Lithium), because often there doesn't have to be apparent excuses for such an incapacitated state. I feel that somewhat undermines the message of this movie.On top of that, it plays stage to one hell of a soundtrack with some of my favourites, such as 'the shins'. I would have never thought I'd see their ""new slang"" track on a hollywood movie back in 2001. Finally some indie rock getting the attention it deserves.

One, I objectively judge the quality level of the movie (story arc, characters, acting), and two, I give the score a personal curve based on how much I personally liked the movie. OK I didn't like this.First of all, objectively judging the quality of the movie, it doesn't seem that bad. It has pretty rounded out characters and plot, IF you're into this sort of story, which I'm not. Actually I couldn't stomach it. To me it was too cute and irrelevant. I had to constantly force myself to not turn this movie off.With no drama in this film, I found myself just indifferently observing the emotional journey of Large and his new friend Sam, two people I don't really care about, although I liked Natalie Portman's charisma. I had zero interest in watching two people and their growing relationship with the only payoff being they fall in love. So what?

628851,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00005JNC2,Nicholas Carroll,"[2, 4]","I rented this because I had heard so many good things about it and after watching it a couple times, it certainly did not disappoint.  Zach Braff has done something remarkable for a debut film project, and its an achievement he should be very proud of.  This film works on several levels, but mostly, its a relevant film for the younger generation that is too often assigned to take drugs to solve whatever problems their parents don't want to deal with.  The numbing of the emotional pains of life doesn't lead to a life fully lived, and in a sense, we are turning our children into emotional zombies.  This film is a wake up call...get off the drugs and experience life the way its meant to be experienced.  Emotional pain is a burden everyone has to work through and deal with, and finally accept before moving on.The great thing about this independent film, as in many independent films, is that it doesn't follow the standard Hollywood formula.  You are taken in with the character and experience his life over the course of four days, as Andrew (Zach Braff) returns home to attend his mother's funeral after a nine year absence.  At home, he avoids his father and hooks up with friends who seem to all be stuck in dead-end jobs (some, quite literally).  Andrew is the only one trying to make something of his life, as a struggling actor in Hollywood who's claim to fame was playing a mentally handicapped football player on a TV show.  He meets the lovely and quirky Natalie Portman at the doctor's office.  Some people have doubted her abilities as an actress after seeing her in the ""Star Wars"" prequels, but make no mistake...see this film and ""Closer"" and you will be captivated by her range.  I loved her performances in both films, but she especially has unique charm in ""Garden State""...helping Andrew come to terms with his long-delayed grief over an incident that happened when he was much younger, guilt that he put aside for years.There are many quirky characters in this film and a couple of them seem caught up in some pyramid schemes.  My favorite small performance is by Method Man, who almost steals the film by his very brief, but hilarious scene.  Perhaps the only person who seems out of place in a film like this is Ian Holme, whom I can't view in any film without thinking Bilbo Baggins!  He often appears like a ghost in this film by his wardrobe choices, and his role is small (his most significant scene is cut and on the deleted scenes special feature) and he just doesn't resemble Zach enough to convince me that he's his father in the film.  It was a minor distraction and what I think is a serious miscast of that role, but not enough for me to subtract a star from the rating.  That's because the overall message of the film is simply powerful and one we should all take to heart.  We should live a life that's uniquely ours and seek moments where we attempt to do things no one else might have ever done before.  To live is to risk, and we can't truly live if we are drugging away our personal pains (whether through doctor-prescribed zoloft/ritalin, or through ecstasy and other illegal means of artificial happiness).  We control our own happiness and we can't be responsible for making other people happy.  That's the garden state of our own desires.  See this film again and again.  Its simply amazing and Zach Braff deserves huge kudos for making this film.",5,A surprising and impressive achievement!,1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,3398,"['rented', 'had', 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'watching', 'couple', 'times', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'done', 'something', 'remarkable', 'debut', 'film', 'project', 'achievement', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'proud', 'film', 'several', 'levels', 'mostly', 'relevant', 'film', 'younger', 'generation', 'too', 'often', 'assigned', 'take', 'drugs', 'solve', 'problems', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'deal', 'numbing', 'emotional', 'pains', 'life', ""n't"", 'lead', 'life', 'fully', 'lived', 'sense', 'are', 'turning', 'children', 'emotional', 'zombies', 'film', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'get', 'off', 'drugs', 'experience', 'life', 'way', 'meant', 'be', 'experienced', 'Emotional', 'pain', 'burden', 'everyone', 'work', 'deal', 'finally', 'accept', 'moving', 'on.The', 'great', 'thing', 'independent', 'film', 'many', 'independent', 'films', ""n't"", 'follow', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'are', 'taken', 'character', 'experience', 'life', 'course', 'four', 'days', 'Andrew', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'home', 'attend', 'mother', 'funeral', 'nine', 'year', 'absence', 'home', 'father', 'up', 'friends', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'stuck', 'dead-end', 'jobs', 'quite', 'literally', 'Andrew', 'only', 'one', 'trying', 'make', 'something', 'life', 'struggling', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'claim', 'fame', 'was', 'playing', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'football', 'player', 'TV', 'show', 'lovely', 'quirky', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'doctor', 'office', 'people', 'have', 'doubted', 'abilities', 'actress', 'seeing', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'make', 'mistake', 'see', 'film', 'Closer', 'will', 'be', 'captivated', 'range', 'loved', 'performances', 'films', 'especially', 'unique', 'charm', 'Garden', 'State', 'helping', 'Andrew', 'come', 'terms', 'long-delayed', 'grief', 'incident', 'happened', 'when', 'was', 'much', 'younger', 'guilt', 'put', 'aside', 'are', 'many', 'quirky', 'characters', 'film', 'couple', 'seem', 'caught', 'up', 'pyramid', 'schemes', 'favorite', 'small', 'performance', 'Method', 'Man', 'who', 'almost', 'film', 'very', 'brief', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'place', 'film', 'Ian', 'Holme', 'whom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'view', 'film', 'thinking', 'Bilbo', 'Baggins', 'often', 'ghost', 'film', 'wardrobe', 'choices', 'role', 'small', 'most', 'significant', 'scene', 'cut', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'special', 'feature', 'just', ""n't"", 'resemble', 'Zach', 'enough', 'convince', 'father', 'film', 'was', 'minor', 'distraction', 'what', 'think', 'serious', 'miscast', 'role', 'not', 'enough', 'subtract', 'star', 'rating', 'overall', 'message', 'film', 'simply', 'powerful', 'one', 'should', 'take', 'heart', 'should', 'live', 'life', 'uniquely', 'ours', 'seek', 'moments', 'where', 'attempt', 'do', 'things', 'one', 'else', 'might', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'before', 'live', 'risk', 'ca', ""n't"", 'truly', 'live', 'are', 'drugging', 'away', 'personal', 'pains', 'doctor-prescribed', 'zoloft/ritalin', 'ecstasy', 'other', 'illegal', 'means', 'artificial', 'happiness', 'control', 'own', 'happiness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'responsible', 'making', 'other', 'people', 'happy', 'garden', 'state', 'own', 'desires', 'See', 'film', 'again', 'again', 'simply', 'amazing', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'huge', 'kudos', 'making', 'film']",Garden State

The movie starts well, with some unique perspective on characterization and techniques in revealing the alone-ness of characters. Yet, the whole plot finally falls into a ""I-love-you-and-I-don't-want-to-leave-you-anymore"" ending. The closure of the movie is disappointing as it seems unconvincing how Largeman (Braff) and Sam (Portman) heal each other's pathological habits and attitudes. Largeman suffers from depression. Why did he experience a siginificant state of epiphany later on? Not clear. Portman claims to ba a pathological liar. Does she really stop lying? Not clear? What is there is merely the romance plot, which, inevitably leads to whole movie to end in a commercial way, like many others high-school romance. Garden State is about the troubled generation, about how the troubled individuals survive in their difficult lives. As a view, I can see how they are troubled, but I can't see how they are relieved. Portman gives an impressive performance, which really revives my memory of her in Closer. Braff's is dull, monotonous and flat.

Some of my friends hailed it as the best movie they have ever seen, some the most romantic. Does it live up to expectations. Well, yes and no.First things first, if you're expecting humor in the vein of Scrubs, don't even bother with this. It is not even remotely close, in fact it doesn't even try to be. The story is about Andrew Largeman, who is on so many drugs, that he basically sleepwalks through life. He has no emotional connections with anybody. He feels empty, that is until his dad calls him one day crying, and says that his mother has just passed away. Andrew then goes back to his hometown, Jersey where he meets some of his old friends and forges a relationship with someone new. The story then revolves around these people over a span of about 4 days. A journey of self discovery ensues...While the story is hardly groundbreaking, I actually fell in love with this movie, largely because of the fantastic cast and superb dialogue. Zach Braff's directorial debut is actually very good. The characters are a delight to watch. They seem so real. They have their share of good moments and self doubts, just like us. Zach Braff, who practically typifies wackiness in Scrubs does pretty much the same here, but toning it down a level and it works wonderfully. Natalie Portman, who I feel is one of the best actors of our generation (or my generation, at least) is great as Samantha. Portman has been in such diverse roles in her short career, and she pulls it off very well each and every time. Her performance here adds a whole lot of ""heart"" to the movie. The rest of the cast, Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm and even Jean Smart provide memorable supporting performances, that stays with you even after the show. As I said, the conversation between characters are also something that drew me into the show. Watch how something you've always thought as petty, turn into something thoughtful. An example of this, is the idea of a ""home"". Don't get it? Watch the movie.Another thing I would like to comment was the cinematography and music. They went hand in hand, the shots of the neighbourhood were beautiful, fitting the story exceptionally well and Zach Braff has an ear for good music. A nice selection of songs that leaves you with some sort of emotion, for the characters and their experiences.All in all, a good movie that's worthy of my recommendation. Just take it for what it is and enjoy the moment. In fact, I think that's what the people behind this movie are hoping for.

Peter Sarsgaard's performance was outstanding, and his character's complexity was mesmerizing.  Ian Holm was in perfect form as the psychiatrist/father, flawed by his inability to accept what is as opposed to what he would prefer. My favorite scene in the movie is set in the quarry, when the 3 main characters stand atop an abandoned piece of equipment and shout into the ""infinite abyss"" before them, after which the awakened hero embraces and enfolds his lover in one of the most tender, realistic, and heartfelt kisses I've ever seen on film.  It was also quite unexpected and delightful to hear ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" by Simon & Garfunkel for the first time in decades.

628859,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00005JNC2,"Promise ""promise""","[0, 0]","Another reviewer called this a ""coming of age"" story.  I think it's a coming-to-life story....something that some people never do, at any age.  I've read the staggering statisics of the number of people on medication, legal and illegal in our fair land, and it's not a pretty fact. To reduce the film to it's basic message: it's better to face the pain of life--that's where the joy is.  But it's so much more than a message film.This is a deceptively simple story but it's so wise and so well told that it really touches the heart.  I don't have TV so I didn't know who Zach Braff was.  Now I do!  I will look for his work in the future.I won't re-tell the story because it's been told enough times here.I just want to add my applause to the others'.  Braff very skillfully walks the line between humour and pathos.  His character has been likened to that of Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate"" but I think this is much better.  The whole cast is super.  It was great to see the wonderful Jean Smart in a small role, as the mom of his grave-robbing buddy.  Ian Holm plays his father, an unsympathetic character, in a very human way that does give the viewer the glimpse of a fundamentally decent man who is as lost in the events of his life as everyone else.Much of the joy and magic of the film goes to Natalie Portman who plays the wonderfully screwy epileptic girl, Sam, who helps the Braff character come back to life.  The role is well written but it could have been butchered in the hands of a lesser actress.  I just saw her in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" where I didn't much like her, so I was amazed at how good she was here.  Her naturalness really made the character touch your heart.  This is the sign of a good actress and good direction.There's more I could say but there are a lot of excellent reviews here.

David Roe,"[28, 36]","I'll have to admit that for the first ten minutes or so of the film, the casual coarse language used by Largeman (Zach Braff)'s high school buddies seemed like a gratuitous and slightly strained reach toward ""hipness,"" in effort to appeal to a younger generation of moviegoers.  Blame this in part on my being on the other side of the generation gap.  But as I began to know the characters better, it dawned on me that this WAS the younger generation (at least a real part of its disenfranchised subculture, one of which I know very little) and offers an honest representation of the way they speak.There is a tremendous heart to this film, characterized when Braff, Natalie Portman, and Peter Sarsgaard's characters both literally and metaphorically unleash a scream into the ""eternal abyss.""  Their pent-up frustration stems from the recognized irony that each of us is trapped in a world not of his own making with all of its seemingly irrational expectations and demands.  Though we may anesthetize ourselves from the sad truths behind our sustaining myth of self-determination, we risk blinding ourselves to the great redeeming aspect of our existance: the love of the people around us.Natalie Portman as Largeman's girlfriend, Sam, is utterly luminous here.  Not to mention she made me fall in love.  I am embarassed to say I had to wait for the end credits to discover who this wonderful actress was (I have religiously avoided the obscenely over-merchandised Star Wars films of late and knew little of her adult work since her childhood debut in ""The Professional."")  Meryl Streep -- your spiritual daughter and future heir is growing up quite nicely.The film's great heroic act belongs to Sarsgaard's character who leads Largeman and Sam on a bizarre odyssey through the small town's seamy underbelly in quest of an equally bizarre ""gift"" for Largeman.  His gift becomes an understated but moving act of redemption.  Redemption is what the film is about.  The fact that each of us posesses the power to in some way redeem one another is the movie's great hope.I understand the squeamish who might balk at the R-rated language.  But the lesson here is that there can be redeeming qualities (and even shared values) among those who don't quite view the world through the same eyes.  Before you close yourself off from someone else's world that you don't understand, just stand there for a moment -- as on Boo Radley's porch -- and view the world from their shoes.  The universe soon begins to look a little different.  And a whole lot larger.

628867,A1R7RSAMR1ST5M,B00005JNC2,R.M.,"[2, 3]","Garden State is a heady combination of innocence, saccharine sweetness, indifference, and inexpertise that never quite jells into a finished product.  A few well-delivered monologues, some fabulous cinematography and a substantial performance by Natalie Portman fail to lift this film out of the rank and file.The film opens to a shot of our protagonist's nightmare of a plan crash.  While all the people around him are crying, panicking, and otherwise coming to grips with their immanent death, our hero Andrew Largemen just sits there with a blank look on his face.  Nothing fazes him - not the screaming stewardess, the bags falling from the overhead bins, or the 60-year-old woman on his left clutching his shirt and crying in his ear.Luckily, the phone rings, and Andrew wakes up to the sound of his father's voice.  Unluckily, it's bad news: his mother has drowned in the bathtub.  Thus Andrew, living in L.A. and estranged from his family for a decade, must return to his hometown in Jersey for the funeral.After the funeral, Andrew runs into a couple of his old high school friends.  (It's just one of the film's many strange situations that these two particular friends now work as gravediggers and are waiting with a bulldozer to fill in his mother's grave.)  They overcome the situation's awkwardness and invite Andrew to a party later that night.  He's got nothing better to do, and so commences the strange round of reconnections with friends, family, acquaintances and strangers.Andrew's medical history plays a pivotal role in the film.  His father, a psychiatrist, has been prescribing Andrew drugs for emotional problems for 16 years.  For some time now, Andrew has been getting sudden headaches, and while he's home he goes to a specialist to figure out what's wrong.  Of course, while he's away from his medicine cabinet in L.A., Andrew finds his headaches improve.  And he wonders whether or not the drugs are really helping...and why his father prescribed them in the first place.While he's at the doctor's, Andrew meets a local girl, Sam.  They begin spending a lot of time together.  Played by Natalie Portman, Sam is both innocently delightful and annoying.  She's a self-admitted pathological liar, lives with her mother in a cloyingly pink house, and harbors her own medical history.  She usually accompanies her stories with gems of advice like ""You always have to laugh at yourself"" and ""Life is what it is.""  Amazingly enough, Ms. Portman manages to make these trite fancies into something more than just trite fancies - a tribute to the genuineness of the girl herself.In general, the script is sometimes clunky and the plot stretches into bizarre flights of fancy.  A junkyard owner living at the bottom of a quarry turns out to embody wholesome family values.  Sam's adopted brother serves to show that hard work really CAN make your dreams come true.  And rather than adding anything to the movie, these tricks seem peripheral to both plot and character development.  It's as if we are take them like pills, swallowing them with the rest of the drugs in the big cocktail that is Garden State.The movie is written and directed by its star, Zach Braff.  Perhaps this explains the oftentimes wooden quality Zach's character, Andrew, has onscreen.  Due to this impassiveness, Andrew seemed one-dimensional: a blank piece of paper that the other players write upon.  It's unfortunate that the movie turns upon Andrew's emotional development: so much of the film is spent without Andrew evidencing any emotion at all that when he actually does try to show some passion, it just feels fake.Ultimately, Garden State is a mess of many different parts, none of which exactly line up into a finished product.  The writing is spotty and though the cinematography is amazing, the editing is quite awful (hey, if I can catch choppy edits in the middle of scenes, then the film editor needs a day job).  The performances of peripheral characters (Peter Sarsgaard as Mark, Ian Holm as Gideon) are quite good but can't quite cover for Zach's expressionless face.

628870,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JNC2,Robert Moore,"[4, 5]","I had intended to see GARDEN STATE when it was in the theaters, but for some reason I never got around to it.  Then when it came out on DVD, I kept intending to see it, but for whatever reason didn't, until now.  As they say, better late than never, and I'll add that this ends a personal losing streak of seeing one disappointing movie after anotherThe movie is basically about a struggling actor in Hollywood who returns to his hometown in New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral.  Like so many movies involving a trip home, this one becomes a journey of self-discovery and renewal, as Andrew Largeman confronts the shape life has taken since the moment he caused a serious accident his mother suffered when he was nine.  Heavily medicated for most of his life, he resolves to get off the host of drugs he is on.  Meanwhile, just as he is determined to get off anti-depressants so that he can feel again, he meets a charming yet quirky girl who has her own set of problems.  For whatever reason, they click and embark on their own romance.Plot in a movie is not the same as execution, but luckily the film is executed marvelously, maintaining a perfect balance between funny but quirky weirdness and emotional authenticity.  The film is full of laughs, but it is much more than just a collection of laughs.  All in all, it is a very impressive movie.You have to love what Zach Braff did in this film.  Few have pulled off the triple feat of acting, writing, and directing as well as he did here.  What is remarkable is how well he managed all three.  As an actor, he is a performer of immense likeability.  I think if he manages to stay within the range of that fundamental likeability as an actor, he is going to have a remarkable career.  The general feeling is that next year will be the last for SCRUBS, which while a great vehicle for Braff is probably keeping him from the movie career that beckons.  I hope that at some point he returns as well to both writing and directing.Natalie Portman is enjoyable in her role as Sam, the epileptic girl he meets and falls in love with.  She is an actress.  I mean by that that she performs roles, she doesn't just play herself in films.  This isn't one of her most impressive performances to date, but it is further evidence of her considerable talent.  Unfortunately, much of her time was eaten up in recent years by the lamentable STAR WARS trilogy.  I'm very anxious to see what she does from here on out.  Her character gave me a bit of a pang because of the way it reminded me of a major ex-girlfriend of mine, who like Sam was a compulsive liar (as with Sam, she would lie on all manner of incredibly small--as well as big--things) and who also like same carried about the tattered remnants of her ""blankey.""  A definite moment of deja vu for me.GARDEN STATE contains one of the most celebrated soundtracks of recent years and it isn't an accident that it has enjoyed considerable success on its own.  In addition to all else that he did on the film, Braff picked out all the songs on the record.  It is a very well chosen selection.  I've often wondered how much of a role, if any, he plays in the music selection of music on SCBUBS, which has some of the best music of any show on TV.All in all, this is a superb movie.

628872,A392BO4M88KUAD,B00005JNC2,Rock Montgomery,"[4, 8]","I must say I had high expectations for this film.  It is not often that a person writes, directs, and acts in his own film.  While Garden State does include some impressive cinematography and camera work, I wish I could say the same about the acting and screenplay.There was something redundant about the entire film--a seemingly depressed protagonist that returns to his hometown, only to find that his family and former acquaintances have changed for the worse.  We must believe that everybody is in a crisis.  Thus, as the viewer, we are treated to watching twentysomethings engaging in some drug and alcohol binges.The characterizations were flat and uneventful.  Natalie Portman plays the most upbeat epileptic I've ever seen on-screen, though her apparent lack of a seizure almost shreds the character's credibility.  At least she's not playing a Prozac candidate--Zach Braff is actually given that role.  What can I say about Zach Braff's performance?  Perhaps I'm used to seeing him on the NBC show Scrubs because I was waiting for him to start cracking jokes at any time (probably since he has the same smart-aleck smirk throughout the film).  The film might have had a raw, emotional feeling if Zach Braff switched roles with the more emotive Peter Sarsgaard.However, a role switch probably wouldn't have had any affect, since the screenplay cops out at the conclusion for a happy ending.  In fact, the film seems to come undone by the last twenty minutes (which included a pointless sex scene that didn't involve the main characters, and the irritating addition of buffoonish Method Man), and tries to make up for its lost momentum.  I think this film had potential, but it was not enough of a ""garden"" variety for me.",2,I have actually seen better,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,1729,"['must', 'say', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'not', 'often', 'person', 'directs', 'acts', 'own', 'film', 'Garden', 'State', 'include', 'impressive', 'cinematography', 'camera', 'work', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'acting', 'screenplay.There', 'was', 'something', 'redundant', 'entire', 'film', 'seemingly', 'depressed', 'protagonist', 'hometown', 'only', 'find', 'family', 'former', 'acquaintances', 'have', 'changed', 'worse', 'must', 'believe', 'everybody', 'crisis', 'Thus', 'viewer', 'are', 'treated', 'watching', 'twentysomethings', 'engaging', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'binges.The', 'characterizations', 'were', 'flat', 'uneventful', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'most', 'upbeat', 'epileptic', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'on-screen', 'apparent', 'lack', 'seizure', 'almost', 'character', 'credibility', 'least', 'not', 'playing', 'Prozac', 'candidate', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'actually', 'given', 'role', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'performance', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'used', 'seeing', 'NBC', 'show', 'Scrubs', 'was', 'waiting', 'start', 'cracking', 'jokes', 'time', 'probably', 'same', 'smart-aleck', 'smirk', 'film', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'raw', 'emotional', 'feeling', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'switched', 'roles', 'more', 'emotive', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard.However', 'role', 'switch', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'affect', 'screenplay', 'out', 'conclusion', 'happy', 'ending', 'fact', 'film', 'come', 'undone', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'included', 'pointless', 'sex', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'involve', 'main', 'characters', 'irritating', 'addition', 'buffoonish', 'Method', 'Man', 'tries', 'make', 'up', 'lost', 'momentum', 'think', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'garden', 'variety']",Garden State
628873,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JNC2,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","****1/2""Garden State"" is anything but a garden variety romantic comedy.  Brilliantly written and directed by Zack Braff (who also plays the lead role), this quirky indie triumph is one of the most delightful and disarming little films to come our way in a long long time.The ironically named Andrew Largeman is a bit like Holden Caulfield, but without all the articulation about his alienation and angst.  In fact, for Andrew, the angst is buried so deep within his psyche that he is completely unable to verbalize what it is that is bothering him.  All he knows is that he isn't happy with either his life or himself as a person.  Andrew confesses that for most of his time here on earth all he has been able to feel is ""numb.""  As the movie begins, we meet Andrew as a struggling actor living in Los Angeles, having fled his hometown in New Jersey years earlier.  Virtually estranged from his parents, Andrew receives the shocking news that his paraplegic mother has died suddenly in a drowning ""accident,"" thus precipitating Andrew's first trip home in ages.  As with many literary and cinematic characters, Andrew learns a great deal about himself and about others by making that return trek back to the place of his roots.It's hard to convey in words just how charming and lovable an experience ""Garden State"" turns out to be.  It is a movie filled with originality, humor, warmth, poignancy and a sly comprehension about life and how best to live it.  As Andrew reconnects with his childhood buddies, he learns that not much has changed in their lives either and that they are no closer to finding true happiness than he is.  So even though fleeing the town may not have been the answer, staying there certainly wasn't the answer either - or at least so he believes until he meets an idiosyncratic young woman named Sam, delightfully played by Natalie Portman.  The two hit it off almost instantly, finding common ground in their peculiarities and eccentricities.  What's impressive about Braff's work here is that he never overdoes the quirkiness as so many other filmmakers do.  He allows it to filter through his tale in such a way that we find ourselves laughing with the people rather than at them.  The folks in this town may not be the smartest or most ambitious people we will ever meet, but somehow they have managed to make life work for them and have remained generally positive and upbeat in the process.Braff, looking a little like a young Ray Romano, perfectly captures the befuddlement, fear and almost crippling self-consciousness that lay at the root of Andrew's unhappiness, while at the same time conveying the good-naturedness and capacity for loving that provide him with the hope that, against all odds, he will someday achieve fulfillment.  He and Portman make such an endearing romantic couple that we just know they will wind up making it in the end.  In addition, there are strong supporting performances from Ian Holm, Peter Sarsgaard, Ron Leibman and a whole host of other talented performers.""Garden State"" provides a subtle little homage to ""The Graduate"" in its closing line - a fitting tribute from a film that captures the offbeat vision and youthful spirit of that earlier classic of anarchic cinema.

When watching this, it feels like there's an adventure happening but really the plot itself is just a link of quirky gimmick after quirky gimmick. The film however is easy to watch and really is visually stunning. There are plenty of quirky scenes, characters and visuals to keep us from falling asleep, but these quirky gimmicks, however, were just that. They were petty, shallow attempts at adding entertaing value-- each one worth about half a second of chuckling. I can here Braff thinking to himself, ""this scene is missing something... oh, lets add an overexcited dog! Ooh, that's witty!"" The movie is filled with this kind of cheap tactic to make the empty and meaningless characters' lives actually interesting enough to follow, but really they don't make sense.First of all, no one makes shirts out of left over wall material and gives them as gifts. That's not comfortable. No one is that shameless. No one who works at Medieval Times goes to work in full plate mail armor. They don't even wear that expensive stuff. I'm not even sure they wear helmets. That bit where they try to return stuff for cash at the giant hardware store... retail stores don't work like that at all. Loss prevention would be all over those crooks. And what was up with Zach Braff living in LA working at an Asian restuarant. That is ridiculous. Ethnic restaurants always hire family or local immigrants because they can pay them ridiculously lower wages. They won't hire young, smug wannabe actors. The list just goes on and on...On a positive note, I have to say this movie has really opened my eyes on how to rate movies. It makes it so much easier! This movie is an exact 5 out of 10! Whenever I see movies now, I think back to this. Was it better or worse than Garden State, and then rate accordingly.This movie is completley overrated.

When weighing whether or not to try this film, I knew that it was not the kind of story I liked, but decided to give it a chance anyway because Portman was starring. The overall result was not bad at all, since even though I did not feel strongly identified with the characters, I got to see an interesting story that is mostly driven by its well-written dialogues.Andrew (Zach Braff) left his parents' house several years ago and traveled to the other side of the country to establish himself in Los Angeles and start an acting career. He was relatively successful at first, but things cooled down and now he is working as a waiter in a Vietnamese restaurant. He has been taking medication for his depression for a long time and lives a vacuous existence. Everything is about to change though, because his father, with whom he has not talked in a while, calls him to reveal that Andrew's mother died. Now he has to go back home to New Jersey and face the world he left behind, including his friends and family. In the process, he meets Sam (Portman) who has issues of her own; but the relationship that begins delivers a thoughtful view of what it feels like to be lost in life when one becomes an adult, and how sometimes we need to shake things up to start moving forward again.Zach Braff undoubtedly meets expectations in his debut as a director and writer, with an engaging script and a well-filmed movie. His performance as Andrew is inspired and completely believable; but he is assisted in this aspect by the excellent Natalie Portman, who has an uncanny ability to portray extroverted girls that speak their mind. These two guys are complemented by an array of colorful characters that add spice to this film. The result is a production that is filled with funny situations and that has a considerable degree of emotions involved. Even though it was not a film that touched me, I can appreciate its quality, therefore I recommend it.",4,"""You are like so freaked out right now""",1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,2134,"['watched', 'Leon', 'Professional', 'wife', 'have', 'been', 'dazzled', 'performances', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'continued', 'picking', 'up', 'several', 'movies', 'just', 'performed', 'When', 'weighing', 'not', 'try', 'film', 'knew', 'was', 'not', 'kind', 'story', 'liked', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'anyway', 'Portman', 'was', 'starring', 'overall', 'result', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'strongly', 'identified', 'characters', 'got', 'see', 'interesting', 'story', 'mostly', 'driven', 'well-written', 'dialogues.Andrew', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'left', 'parents', 'house', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'traveled', 'other', 'side', 'country', 'establish', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'start', 'acting', 'career', 'was', 'relatively', 'successful', 'first', 'things', 'cooled', 'down', 'now', 'working', 'waiter', 'Vietnamese', 'restaurant', 'been', 'taking', 'medication', 'depression', 'long', 'time', 'vacuous', 'existence', 'Everything', 'change', 'though', 'father', 'whom', 'not', 'talked', 'while', 'reveal', 'Andrew', 'mother', 'died', 'Now', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'New', 'Jersey', 'face', 'world', 'left', 'behind', 'including', 'friends', 'family', 'process', 'Sam', 'Portman', 'who', 'issues', 'own', 'relationship', 'thoughtful', 'view', 'what', 'be', 'lost', 'life', 'when', 'one', 'adult', 'how', 'sometimes', 'need', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'start', 'moving', 'forward', 'again.Zach', 'Braff', 'undoubtedly', 'expectations', 'debut', 'director', 'writer', 'engaging', 'script', 'well-filmed', 'movie', 'performance', 'Andrew', 'inspired', 'completely', 'believable', 'assisted', 'aspect', 'excellent', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'portray', 'extroverted', 'girls', 'speak', 'mind', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'complemented', 'array', 'colorful', 'characters', 'add', 'spice', 'film', 'result', 'production', 'filled', 'funny', 'situations', 'considerable', 'degree', 'emotions', 'involved', 'Even', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'touched', 'can', 'appreciate', 'quality', 'therefore', 'recommend']",Garden State

Peter Sarsgard's perfomance is particularly good, and Portman also does well in her hopeful effort to break away from wooden Star Wars roles.  But overall, what writer/director/actor Zach Braff delivers is more of what has become Indie formula.  If you `ve seen (starting with) ""The Graduate,"" ""Donnie Darko,"" ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" ""The Royal Tennenbaums,"" ""Rushmore,"" ""Ghost World"" and any number of other ""indie"" efforts, you've seen better versions of the same.  Actually, ""The Graduate"" isn't really an indie, but it nailed for all time the whole detached/alienated youth thing that has been a well for indie directors to go back to again and again.

In fact the general tempo of Garden State is reminiscent of a recent film with similar idiosynchratic tones, The Station Agent.But director/writer/actor Braff's ability to underplay his befuddled stance in the midst of wacky comedy without appearing silly himself, is quite impressive. His sublime sensibility permeates the entire film as our protagonist visits his mother's house after a patch of nine years to attend her funeral, in the process reuniting with his old high school buddies as well as his family.The characters are interestingly quirky, some less hokey than others, but I couldn't help leaving with an intense personal disdain for Natalie Portman and her incredulous antics.The humour is endearing and generally clever, plus we get a certain ""detour"" that turns out to be thematically quite relevant. Much of the film's fizz wears out by the tail end though.A word for the soundtrack: it is stellar, throwing into the fray some cool chill-out inputs from Zero 7 and Coldplay. I recommend it more than the film itself, get a copy if you like your music relaxed and downtempo.Overall, Garden State is a likeable little charmer with incidental pleasures, but it's not quite the cinematic Eden that critics promised.

I thought it would give me the same melancholy satisfaction and joy as did The Royal Tenenbaums. But what I got was a terrible performance from Zach Braff, with a terrible script, and some of the most unlikable characters I've ever had the misfortune to see on the big screen. One star is far too generous. There really was not much acting involved, Braff decided to simply state all of the emotions and experiences we are supposed to see acted out. But apparently, these people were far too high and/or drunk to actually have emotions beyond Portman's random crying.Perhaps the most frustrating part of my Garden State experience were the excellent reviews and recommendations. I've never had such an urge to tear apart the screen. The characters only seem to be capable of ""finding happiness"" through drug-use, stealing, and ignoring their problems with the aforementioned. I'm one of the most open-minded film goers in existence: There is no ""type"" or genre that doesn't have at least a few movies I love. But never have I seen something advertised as a beautiful, sensitive film about self-discovery only to find out it's nothing more than a bunch of idiotic future-alcoholics and addicts partying to forget about the things that should really matter. I have a hard time enjoying a film filled with characters I wouldn't be able to stand in real life. And ""quirky"" is not the word for this film. I love quirky. Am&eacute;lie is quirky. Edward Scissorhands is quirky. Garden State is a bad attempt at looking deep and clever by some people who seem to think the only way to ""feel alive"" is to do as many drugs as you can because they think crap like meth is better for you than antidepressants.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[2, 3]","Zach Braff's ""Garden State"" is a small and simple tale about a pair of lonely souls finding happiness in each other's company.  Although small in scope, it nonetheless enchants because of its ample supply of charm.Andrew Largeman (Braff) returns to his hometown after the death of his mother.  Andrew's father, Gideon (Ian Holm) wants to re-establish his relationship with his son but Andrew chooses to keep company with his circle of old friends instead.  One day he meets a girl named Sam (Natalie Portman) who starts to introduce him to all the possibilities life can offer him.  As their relationship develops, Andrew finds the courage to come to grips with his tragic past.The success of ""Garden State"" is due primarily to the three performances at the center of the story.  Zach Braff gives just the right touch of poignancy to Andrew and Peter Sarsgaard brings a likeable, roguish charm to Mark, one of Andrew's old friends.  It is Portman, however, that shines the brightest.  Her offbeat and touching performance gives the film its eccentric identity.  While the melodrama in ""Garden State"" gets a little too heavy at spots, its universal story about moving on with one's life still is told well enough to make the film worthy of a viewing.",3,"""Tickle is my favorite thing in the whole world.

Well, in a way it reminded me of one of my other favorite movies also featuring Natalie Portman-  Beautiful Girls (if you haven't seen it- go rent it now!). The major similarity was that this guy has come home, back to his parents house & town he grew up in- after being away for a very long time. And naturally, he has a strained relationship with his parents, or in both cases, their fathers. So here's this guy who's so out of place, back to where he once belonged; running into friends, trying to cope with his family; trying to sort his whole life out.Of course, this is a great story. I mean, it's so human. Being 25 and trying to figure out your life and where you're headed, trying to deal with your past. It's the past in this movie that really keeps it flowing- and how the character deals with it. That, and his chance meeting with Natalie's character and their subsequent dates. Both Zach and Natalie are naturals for these rolls and I think- really give Oscar worthy performances. I don't know how else to describe it- other than they were so real.I whole-heartedly recommend this movie. I think Zack deserves to at least be nominated for an Oscar for such a well-written, thought-out, well put together, funny, sad and interesting movie.

""Large"" hasn't been home in over nine years and there is a serious riff between him and his father. Over the course of four days Large attends several parties, meeting up with many of his old high school chums who are working at a variety of occupations: one is a grave digger, another works as a knight at a Medieval Times, another lives in a mansion after having invented noiseless velcro. While sitting in a doctor's waiting room, Large is introduced to Sam (Natalie Portman), a young girl with a very quirky, personal, and forceful personality. Over the next few days the two share in a series of casual adventures and fall in love, but not knowing how to express that love to each other.GARDEN STATE is the directorial debut of Braff. Braff is best known for his starring role as J.D. in the television comi-drama, SCRUBS. Many people who are fans of SCRUBS don't like GARDEN STATE because the two are two completely different formats and Braff is actually a very talented actor & filmmaker and not just a lucky caricature who has a pretty face. The film is not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a great directorial debut.The movie doesn't really have much plot and instead tends to rely upon style, technique, and meaning. The film has several shots that just in and of themselves are pure art; they are like moving snapshots in a virtual photography gallery. There are also several interesting filmmaking techniques incorporating throughout the picture that shake up the pace and keep things interesting. But the heart of the movie is the meaning behind it all. Large's life is like millions of people throughout the country--he has just been existing in a dream-like, drug-enhanced state since the time he was a child. Excluding the unhappy childhood, his whole life has been nothing but one moment of existence from another. All of that changes when he meets Sam. She causes him to look at things differently and tenders the desire within himself to begin living life, in all of its pain & suffering, joy & sorrow, adventure & mundane. When Large meets Sam, he stops just existing and begins truly living.That idea is full of all kinds of implications and could be seen as a spiritual allegory. There aren't very many experienced filmmakers who can pull together art, technique, and substance in a way that makes sense and is worth watching. Hardly any freshman filmmakers can pull off such a task, but Braff has succeeded where many others have failed. Add in a mix of a beautiful soundtrack (Braff was also the soundtrack producer) and some high-quality acting from Braff, Portman, and Peter Sarsgaard (who plays Large's best friend, Mark) and it makes for one fairly impressive directorial debut.",4,You've Got to Have Heart,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,2879,"['Andrew', 'Largeman', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'semi-successful', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'home', 'Garden', 'State', 'New', 'Jersey', 'mother', 'funeral', 'Large', ""n't"", 'been', 'home', 'nine', 'years', 'serious', 'riff', 'father', 'course', 'four', 'days', 'Large', 'several', 'parties', 'meeting', 'up', 'many', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'chums', 'who', 'are', 'working', 'variety', 'occupations', 'one', 'grave', 'digger', 'knight', 'Medieval', 'Times', 'lives', 'mansion', 'having', 'invented', 'noiseless', 'velcro', 'sitting', 'doctor', 'waiting', 'room', 'Large', 'introduced', 'Sam', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'young', 'girl', 'very', 'quirky', 'personal', 'forceful', 'personality', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'two', 'share', 'series', 'casual', 'adventures', 'fall', 'love', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'express', 'love', 'other.GARDEN', 'STATE', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Braff', 'Braff', 'best', 'known', 'starring', 'role', 'J.D', 'television', 'comi-drama', 'SCRUBS', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'SCRUBS', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'GARDEN', 'STATE', 'two', 'are', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'formats', 'Braff', 'actually', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'filmmaker', 'not', 'just', 'lucky', 'caricature', 'who', 'pretty', 'face', 'film', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'great', 'directorial', 'debut.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'plot', 'instead', 'tends', 'rely', 'upon', 'style', 'technique', 'meaning', 'film', 'several', 'shots', 'just', 'are', 'pure', 'art', 'are', 'moving', 'snapshots', 'virtual', 'photography', 'gallery', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'interesting', 'filmmaking', 'techniques', 'incorporating', 'picture', 'shake', 'up', 'pace', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'heart', 'movie', 'meaning', 'Large', 'life', 'millions', 'people', 'country', 'just', 'been', 'existing', 'dream-like', 'drug-enhanced', 'state', 'time', 'was', 'child', 'Excluding', 'unhappy', 'childhood', 'whole', 'life', 'been', 'nothing', 'one', 'moment', 'existence', 'changes', 'when', 'Sam', 'look', 'things', 'differently', 'desire', 'begin', 'living', 'life', 'pain', 'suffering', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'adventure', 'mundane', 'When', 'Large', 'meets', 'Sam', 'just', 'existing', 'truly', 'living.That', 'idea', 'full', 'kinds', 'implications', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'spiritual', 'allegory', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'many', 'experienced', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'can', 'pull', 'together', 'art', 'technique', 'substance', 'way', 'sense', 'worth', 'watching', 'Hardly', 'freshman', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'such', 'task', 'Braff', 'succeeded', 'where', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'failed', 'Add', 'mix', 'beautiful', 'soundtrack', 'Braff', 'was', 'also', 'soundtrack', 'producer', 'high-quality', 'acting', 'Braff', 'Portman', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'Large', 'best', 'friend', 'Mark', 'one', 'fairly', 'impressive', 'directorial', 'debut']",Garden State

I've seen enough quirky, feel-good love stories that I've grown a bit jaded on them. But from the start this one feels different. It is quirky, but not in a canned, contrived way. Each little episode lives and breaths on its own. I laughed out loud several times. Natalie Portman is great. Her role here reminds me of the child actor she was from Leon (The Professional), and that's a good thing. She's versatile and full of life and bubbling with humor. So, it's not that anything in this movie is surprising. It's just that its done so lovingly, with great care and craftsmanship. Zach Braff obviously wanted to make a lasting, quality film.

628902,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B00005JNC2,Wesley Mullins,"[2, 4]","The characters in ""Garden State"" all want to return to a simpler time in their lives, without the pain and disappointment they have come to expect.  Some create alternative realities with drugs and parties, and some just dream of what could be.  But the hero of the film, Andrew (Zack Braff), seeks a happy youth that never existed.  His nostalgia is for a home he never knew and joy he never felt.""Garden State"" is Andrew's return to the hometown of his youth to attend the funeral of his mother.  While there, he struggles with the realities that have kept him medicated and in therapy for most of his life.  Numb and unemotional, Andrew seeks meaning and inspiration amid the ruins of his childhood.  He finds answers in the passionate and spontaneous Sam (Natalie Portman), his opposite in every way, except degrees of affliction.Sam teaches Andrew lessons that the film tries to convey to the audience.  She promises the rewards of non-conformity and challenges Andrew to embrace life, even when it dishes out pain.  Ever the heart-stealer, Portman's irresistible performance will remind viewers of her break-out role in ""Beautiful Girls"", where even as a young girl, she provided direction and answers to a lost male in his mid-twenties.Portman's livewire Sam fits nicely in this sometimes somber and slow-moving film.  Also helping prevent a boring tone is a wicked sense of humor.  Comedy sprouts up with incidents that focus on the peculiar elements of life, like Dessert Storm trading cards and noiseless Velcro.  Rather than manufacturing unrealistic comic situations, the film instead explores the nuances of life and allows humor to grow naturally.Justly compared to ""The Graduate"" for its mood-establishing and generation-reflecting soundtrack, ""Garden State"" decorates its scenes with fresh, relaxing sounds.  Some have described the soundtrack as a ""lazy, rainy afternoon"", words that can be also applied to the film.

I think that it's overhyped, and that it tries to hard to capture the viewer's attention, which is ironic, since the film has a exceedingly thin plot. Garden State's non-existing plot and direction by Zach Braff allows us to follow a guy we hardly know anything about as he re-connects with his high school friends and an eccentric girl he met at a clinic, who he winds up falling in love with. The film attempts to stand on it's own feet with the cast's performances and the script's dialogue alone, but ultimately, it falls over. The ending of the film is completely cliched. The fact that high school kids think it's so ""deep"" baffles me. It's as if they're attempting to read between lines that aren't there. The problem with disliking ""Garden State"" is that when you express your opinion, the emo kids and fans of the film claim that ""you don't get it"".
