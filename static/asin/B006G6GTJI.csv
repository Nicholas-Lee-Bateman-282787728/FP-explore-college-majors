1514889,A3JSO0N085OQXU,B006G6GTJI,B. Wasden,"[6, 9]","My Pure Joy is a new horror film that is completely twisted. In the movie, there are eight gruesome deaths, some of which are hard to watch. When people aren't dying, we are mostly listening to serial killer Adam and his stoner buddies talk a lot about not much all. Those expecting a slasher movie with more action than talk will be disappointed. And I was somewhat disappointed to, because there are a lot of critics who really built My Pure Joy up to be a great film, and it isn't. It's not bad, and it's moments. But it is very rough around the edges, and more along the lines of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer than a slasher movie in the traditional sense.",3,Not Completely A 'Joy' To Watch,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,665,"['Pure', 'Joy', 'new', 'horror', 'film', 'completely', 'twisted', 'movie', 'are', 'eight', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'are', 'hard', 'watch', 'When', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'dying', 'are', 'mostly', 'listening', 'serial', 'killer', 'Adam', 'stoner', 'buddies', 'talk', 'lot', 'not', 'much', 'expecting', 'slasher', 'movie', 'more', 'action', 'talk', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'are', 'lot', 'critics', 'who', 'really', 'built', 'My', 'Pure', 'Joy', 'up', 'be', 'great', 'film', ""n't"", 'not', 'bad', 'moments', 'very', 'rough', 'edges', 'more', 'lines', 'Henry', 'Portrait', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'slasher', 'movie', 'traditional', 'sense']",My Pure Joy

The rest should come together easily.  When he's with his friends he loves talking horror movies, but when he can't get the girl his heart is set on, he loses his mind and kills everyone.  The film portrays how a troubled young man, plagued with too many disappointments and setbacks can no longer cope with life without a girlfriend, deteriorates into a full-time serial killer.  This film is extremely well done, so well expertly pulled off, that I believed bad things like this could actually happen to what were once honest men struggling to hold on to what's left of their conscience or sanity.

My one star rating goes only to Alexi Ryan for his role as Adam, he was believable as a person with issues, however the rest of the film was blah and boring,way too much time talking and just doing nothing interesting, even the altercation scene at the party was lame and left me rolling my eyes, the so called ""gore"" effects were cheezy and not believabe, there were some reviews that said the opening scene was so brutal....really?..I've seen better in a PG13 movie.....(WARNING: scene spoiler alert). The close up of a girls vagina being stabbed was so bad, it was just a silicone sex toy that was used....so poorly done.

1514893,A3UXD39O63GB90,B006G6GTJI,Keith M,"[0, 1]","On the outside Adam appears to be a normal teenager, but underneath...his mind has been so rotted by trauma from his past and the gory films he watches, that he has blurred the lines between reality and pretend! This prompts Adam to start killing people in similar ways to films he watches, making sure to put his own little spin on it.MY PURE JOY in one word....demented, insane, twisted, cruel, brutal, and maddening.  Is there one word to describe all of those and then some?This is the type of B movie I can watch multiple times because I know a lot was poured into the film and anyone's first feature film deserves extra appreciation.  I felt like I was watching a combination of SCREAM and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  As Adam states in the movie, the murders were ITCHI THE KILLER style.  I was not familiar with ITCHI THE KILLER and had to Google it.  ITCHI THE KILLER is a Japanese film that has been banned in several countries due to its high impact violence and graphic depictions of cruelty.  It must have been a huge inspiration for MY PURE JOY, because it contained some disgustingly awesome scenes and the way it was done was a bit trippy.The film has a lot of dialogue, but it was funny and easy to listen to.  There are flashbacks to Adam and his father watching slasher films while his father was sick in bed.  Adam's father told Adam that the only way you can get through people is by fear.  Something Adam took seriously.  Interesting enough is that James watched endless movies with his father years ago when his father was sick.  How much inspiration from James father went into MY PURE JOY?As the movie moves along, the killings occur more often and are equally brutal.  Adam's relationship with his mom cracked me up.  He will go off on her and cuss at her and threaten her, but she's rather casual about it.  Personally I could never swear at my mother, so I think that's what made it funny to me.  Especially after Adam overflows the bathtub and is cleaning up the mess.  His mom sees a knife on him and after he tells her that he'll put the knife in her juggler, she just says he shouldn't talk to her that way and tells him to throw the towels into the dryer when he's done.Near the end, we meet Adam's brother who disappeared for a decade.  (Somewhat Spoiler Alert) He discovers Adam is the serial killer and has a difficult time convincing the mother.  Eventually the mother is convinced and they confront Adam.  I wasn't sure how it would end.  Watch it!MY PURE JOY is a film that you'll enjoy...purely....if you have a good sense of humor and enjoy trippy serial killer movies.",5,Messed Up - a great watch!!!,1377820800,"08 30, 2013",2013,2602,"['outside', 'Adam', 'be', 'normal', 'teenager', 'underneath', 'mind', 'been', 'so', 'rotted', 'trauma', 'past', 'gory', 'films', 'blurred', 'lines', 'reality', 'pretend', 'Adam', 'start', 'killing', 'people', 'similar', 'ways', 'films', 'making', 'sure', 'put', 'own', 'little', 'spin', 'it.MY', 'PURE', 'JOY', 'one', 'word', '.demented', 'insane', 'twisted', 'cruel', 'brutal', 'maddening', 'there', 'one', 'word', 'describe', 'then', 'type', 'B', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'multiple', 'times', 'know', 'lot', 'was', 'poured', 'film', 'anyone', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'extra', 'appreciation', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'combination', 'SCREAM', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'Adam', 'states', 'movie', 'murders', 'were', 'ITCHI', 'THE', 'KILLER', 'style', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'ITCHI', 'THE', 'KILLER', 'had', 'Google', 'KILLER', 'Japanese', 'film', 'been', 'banned', 'several', 'countries', 'due', 'high', 'impact', 'violence', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'cruelty', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'inspiration', 'MY', 'PURE', 'JOY', 'contained', 'disgustingly', 'awesome', 'scenes', 'way', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'bit', 'trippy.The', 'film', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'was', 'funny', 'easy', 'listen', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'Adam', 'father', 'watching', 'slasher', 'films', 'father', 'was', 'sick', 'bed', 'Adam', 'father', 'told', 'Adam', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'people', 'fear', 'Something', 'Adam', 'took', 'seriously', 'Interesting', 'enough', 'James', 'watched', 'endless', 'movies', 'father', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'father', 'was', 'sick', 'How', 'much', 'inspiration', 'James', 'went', 'MY', 'PURE', 'JOY', 'movie', 'along', 'killings', 'occur', 'more', 'often', 'are', 'equally', 'brutal', 'Adam', 'relationship', 'mom', 'cracked', 'up', 'will', 'go', 'off', 'cuss', 'threaten', 'rather', 'casual', 'Personally', 'could', 'never', 'swear', 'mother', 'think', 'what', 'made', 'Especially', 'Adam', 'bathtub', 'cleaning', 'up', 'mess', 'mom', 'knife', ""'ll"", 'put', 'knife', 'juggler', 'just', 'should', ""n't"", 'talk', 'way', 'throw', 'towels', 'dryer', 'when', 'end', 'meet', 'Adam', 'brother', 'who', 'disappeared', 'decade', 'Somewhat', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Adam', 'serial', 'killer', 'difficult', 'time', 'convincing', 'mother', 'Eventually', 'mother', 'convinced', 'confront', 'Adam', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'Watch', 'MY', 'PURE', 'JOY', 'film', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'purely', '.if', 'have', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'enjoy', 'trippy', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies']",My Pure Joy
