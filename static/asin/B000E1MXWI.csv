""brnn64""","[11, 11]","Its somethines the case that after seeing a show you haven't seen since childhood, you're often disappointed that it really wasn't as good as you remembered. This sampler is an exception to the rule.While not a comprehensive set, it has some really entertaining episodes.""One Flu Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is the unlikely tale of Kotter's sweathogs being forced to share a class with some gifted studetns durig a flu epidemic. Good comedic moments and an interesitng message about people being gifted in different ways.Another tale has the comically pathetic resident geek-boy Arnold Horshack (Ron Palillo) joining a cult. He's really at his comic best in this one (especially when he recites the Baba's matra) and in an interesting twist Ellen Travolta (castmate John Travolta's mother) plays Horshack's mom. Interestingly, weak and silly characters joining ridiculous cults (see a similar episode involving Rerun in the ""What's happening"" season II set) were a staple of seventies sitcoms. The Jim Jones tragedy of 1978 stopped this trend.The other episodes, such as the Sweathogs joining a gang, Travolta's guilt after a teacher has a heart attack while yelling at him, and were Travolta becomes a priest, all have their moments of knee-slapping leave your brains at the door fun.Gabe Kaplan's storytelling interludes in these tales reign supreme, especially the yarn about his uncle facing a firing squad (you've got to hear this)! Bonzo Maretti was quite a guy.It's too bad that Gabe Kaplan's 1974 comedy album ""Holes and Mellow Rolls"" (which inspired this show) isn't currently available. But in either case, this is a good way to have some knee-slapping belly laughs after a long day at work or school.",5,Schoolday madness holds up well after all these years,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,1707,"['somethines', 'case', 'seeing', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'childhood', ""'re"", 'often', 'disappointed', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'remembered', 'sampler', 'exception', 'rule.While', 'not', 'comprehensive', 'set', 'really', 'entertaining', 'episodes', 'One', 'Flu', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'unlikely', 'tale', 'Kotter', 'sweathogs', 'being', 'forced', 'share', 'class', 'gifted', 'studetns', 'durig', 'flu', 'epidemic', 'Good', 'comedic', 'moments', 'interesitng', 'message', 'people', 'being', 'gifted', 'different', 'ways.Another', 'tale', 'comically', 'pathetic', 'resident', 'geek-boy', 'Arnold', 'Horshack', 'Ron', 'Palillo', 'joining', 'cult', 'really', 'comic', 'best', 'one', 'especially', 'when', 'Baba', 'matra', 'interesting', 'twist', 'Ellen', 'Travolta', 'castmate', 'John', 'Travolta', 'mother', 'Horshack', 'mom', 'Interestingly', 'weak', 'silly', 'characters', 'joining', 'ridiculous', 'cults', 'see', 'similar', 'episode', 'involving', 'Rerun', 'What', 'happening', 'season', 'II', 'set', 'were', 'staple', 'seventies', 'sitcoms', 'Jim', 'Jones', 'tragedy', '1978', 'stopped', 'trend.The', 'other', 'episodes', 'such', 'Sweathogs', 'joining', 'gang', 'Travolta', 'guilt', 'teacher', 'heart', 'attack', 'yelling', 'were', 'Travolta', 'priest', 'have', 'moments', 'knee-slapping', 'leave', 'brains', 'door', 'fun.Gabe', 'Kaplan', 'storytelling', 'interludes', 'tales', 'reign', 'supreme', 'especially', 'yarn', 'uncle', 'facing', 'firing', 'squad', ""'ve"", 'got', 'hear', 'Bonzo', 'Maretti', 'was', 'quite', 'guy.It', 'too', 'bad', 'Gabe', 'Kaplan', '1974', 'comedy', 'Holes', 'Mellow', 'Rolls', 'inspired', 'show', ""n't"", 'currently', 'available', 'case', 'good', 'way', 'have', 'knee-slapping', 'belly', 'long', 'day', 'work', 'school']",N/A

965941,A3875KWK1PXG7I,B000E1MXWI,Robert Huggins,"[24, 29]","Maybe it's the episode selection on this ""sampler"" release but, after viewing the six episodes included on this DVD, I found that ""Welcome Back Kotter"" just didn't hold up for me as well as some other sitcoms from the same era.  That said, there are still a number of reasons to like and enjoy this show.  For starters, Gabe Kaplan's humorous stories still tickle the funny bone, and it's a shame that he did not find other television vehicles suited to his comedic talents after this series ended.  I also enjoyed Marcia Strassman's role as Kotter's wife Julie, even though her role was secondary in the early years of the show.  In a few of the episodes, she has a bigger part and, when given the opportunity, she really shines.  And, who can forget John Sebastian's great theme song, surely one of the most memorable in the annals of television history that's perfectly matched to the opening/closing scenes of life in Brooklyn.  So what's not to like about this popular series?  In a nutshell, the writing for the ""Sweathogs"" generally tends to be weak.  While there are some truly funny moments, the writing tends to be repetitious . . . in almost every episode, you can be assured that Washington will say ""Hi there,"" Barbarino will quizzically ask ""What . . . When . . . Where . . .,"" Horshack will do his ""ooh, ooh"" routine, and there'll be yet another note from Epstein's mother.  These characterizations are funny a few times . . . but not when repeated in almost every show.Considering that most of the episodes were taped nearly 30 years ago, this 6-episode DVD release looks and sounds great.  Fans of the series looking to get good clean transfers of a few episodes will likely be happy with this abbreviated presentation from Warner Home Video and I hope, for their sake, that full seasons will eventually be released.

What a pity!I was born in '74 so I never got a chance to get this show ""fresh out of the door"". I remember as a teenager making myself wake up in the wee hours of the morning to catch this show in reruns and I think I used to think it was really great otherwise why WOULD I be up in the wee hours??? Before I bought this sampler I couldn't remember ANY of the episodes at all so I thought I'd buy this and gear myself up for buying the series when it finally came out. At this point though, this compilation is just enough for me. Maybe there are some great episodes that I've forgotten and they didn't make it on here but I think I'll risk it.Mr Kotter/Kaplan - I think he (and his character) are the only ones who seem to enjoy his 'uncle' jokes. You can see him almost smirking before he begins, during the telling of the joke and laughing openly at his own jokes after the telling of it. I have never found even one of his planned jokes funny. So sad Gabe, so sad! And what was the point of those jokes anyway??? Filler? The funniest one on this set was told by Mr. Woodman (the vice principal) and I laugh now thinking of it! You'll have to watch the DVD to see though...There is so little that's funny I'll be kind and have no spoilers here.The Sweathogs - Vinnie, I love the look...the dumb act (what...where...) doesn't fly and gets tedious after a while. Washington is the tall slim cool black dude from that era (think Jimmie Walker from Good Times) and I think he's funny at times but it's all the same old same old after a while. Epstein with his notes *yawn*...Horshack...can be very funny at times (reminiscent of Jack McFarlane, Will and Grace) but then I guess there's that thin line between funny and unfunny that makes him almost Urkel-esque with the ""ooh-ooh"" and the high-pitched whiny attitude as in the Deprogramming of Arnold Horshack. I quite liked him in Sweatside Story though.For me, all of the characters were at their best in Sweatside Story. I've watched it multiple times and still laughed at most of it. You know how some things seem to get funnier the more you watch? This episode did it for me. The others I could give a miss. On the whole, I got a good deal on the DVD so I'm happy I have it (for the nostalgic factor - the song, the scenes of Brooklyn, the reminder of how John Travolta used to look, the Afro/Jewfro trend, the memories of when guys used to wear jeans as tight as women's...heh, heh, heh). I'll pull it out every few years or so and maybe it'll be funnier and funnier as I seep slowly into old age and senility :)",3,I missed out on sleep for THIS?,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,2636,"['think', 'had', 'more', 'nostalgia', 'theme', 'song', 'actual', 'show', 'What', 'pity', 'was', 'born', ""'74"", 'so', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'get', 'show', 'fresh', 'door', 'remember', 'teenager', 'making', 'wake', 'up', 'wee', 'hours', 'morning', 'catch', 'show', 'reruns', 'think', 'used', 'think', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'otherwise', 'why', 'WOULD', 'be', 'up', 'wee', 'hours', 'bought', 'sampler', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ANY', 'episodes', 'so', 'thought', ""'d"", 'buy', 'gear', 'up', 'buying', 'series', 'when', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'point', 'compilation', 'just', 'enough', 'Maybe', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'here', 'think', ""'ll"", 'risk', 'it.Mr', 'Kotter/Kaplan', 'think', 'character', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'seem', 'enjoy', ""'uncle"", 'jokes', 'can', 'see', 'almost', 'smirking', 'telling', 'joke', 'laughing', 'openly', 'own', 'jokes', 'telling', 'have', 'never', 'found', 'even', 'one', 'planned', 'jokes', 'funny', 'So', 'sad', 'Gabe', 'so', 'sad', 'was', 'point', 'jokes', 'anyway', 'Filler', 'funniest', 'one', 'set', 'was', 'told', 'Mr.', 'Woodman', 'vice', 'principal', 'laugh', 'now', 'thinking', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'DVD', 'see', 'so', 'little', 'funny', ""'ll"", 'be', 'kind', 'have', 'spoilers', 'here.The', 'Sweathogs', 'Vinnie', 'love', 'look', 'dumb', 'act', 'what', 'where', ""n't"", 'fly', 'tedious', 'while', 'Washington', 'tall', 'slim', 'cool', 'black', 'dude', 'era', 'think', 'Jimmie', 'Walker', 'Good', 'Times', 'think', 'funny', 'times', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'while', 'Epstein', 'notes', '*yawn*', 'Horshack', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'times', 'reminiscent', 'Jack', 'McFarlane', 'Will', 'Grace', 'then', 'guess', 'thin', 'line', 'funny', 'unfunny', 'almost', 'Urkel-esque', 'ooh-ooh', 'high-pitched', 'whiny', 'attitude', 'Deprogramming', 'Arnold', 'Horshack', 'quite', 'liked', 'Sweatside', 'Story', 'characters', 'were', 'best', 'Sweatside', 'Story', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'multiple', 'times', 'still', 'laughed', 'most', 'know', 'how', 'things', 'seem', 'get', 'funnier', 'more', 'watch', 'episode', 'did', 'others', 'could', 'give', 'miss', 'whole', 'got', 'good', 'deal', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'happy', 'have', 'nostalgic', 'factor', 'song', 'scenes', 'Brooklyn', 'reminder', 'how', 'John', 'Travolta', 'used', 'look', 'Afro/Jewfro', 'trend', 'memories', 'when', 'guys', 'used', 'wear', 'jeans', 'as', 'tight', 'women', 'heh', 'heh', 'heh', ""'ll"", 'pull', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'so', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'funnier', 'funnier', 'seep', 'slowly', 'old', 'age', 'senility']",N/A
