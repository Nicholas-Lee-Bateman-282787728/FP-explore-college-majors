759483,AX1QTOOXPVD8L,B00009XN4E,"Balaji Rajam ""Wannabe Reviewer""","[1, 1]","Once in a while you come across a movie which is very difficult to watch. Not because it is a bad movie but due to the nature of the topic it deals with. A similar movie which comes to mind is The Woodsman (Kevin Bacon gives an outstanding performance as a man released from prison after serving time for child molestation. And the direction by Nicole Kassell is absolutely brilliant).Any movie which deals with child abuse is somehow very difficult for me to watch. It is a mixture of disgust and curiousness that engulfs me when I watch this. While the acts of the protagonist makes me squirm, there is that part of me that is curious to know what made them that way. It also makes me wonder is there any way to change them.Stevie is a documentary made by Steve James (of Hoop Dreams fame). This is the story of a boy (Stevie) the director came to know through the Big Brothers and Big Sisters program. The director returns to Southern Illinois after nearly 10 years to see how his 'little brother' is doing. And the picture he sees isn't pretty.Probably because I have been part of a mentoring program for nearly 2 years, it makes this movie a little extra special to me.Stevie's childhood is nothing short of a nightmare. An absuive and violent mom who abandons him (We later find out that she was using him as an outlet for her anger towards his father who left her), raped in a foster home, never really cared for except by one set of foster parents.Now in his mid twenties, Stevie has been arrested numerous times for variety of crimes. During the course of the movie, he is also charged with molesting his 8-year old cousin. The movie's latter half follows this trial.While the director doesn't use the troubled childhood as an excuse for the crimes Stevie has committed, he tries to show us that Stevie really never had a fair chance at becoming a real person.There are a variety of characters who appear in this landscape of trailer parks and rural towns. There is Bernice - Stevie's mom who finally returns home, Brenda (Stevie's sister) and her husband who care for Stevie despite his flaws and Stevie's girlfriend Tonya who loves Stevie all the same.Quite a few critics of the movie have criticized the director for being too involved in the movie. But according to me, they are overlooking the fact that it is Steven's story to some extent too. He is a part of Stevie's life and a story of that is not quite complete without him in it.The movie ends with Stevie being sent to prison for 10 years for the molestation charges.A moving depiction of the intricacies of human nature, it leaves us with a whole bunch of questions.What if Stevie's mom was better to him ?What if Steven had been his mentor longer ?What if Stevie's favorite foster family had been able to keep him longer ?Well....I guess we will never know.It left me wondering how will I react if I too saw the same bleak picture of my mentee 10 years from now.",4,Of Stevie and Steven,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,2935,"['Once', 'while', 'come', 'movie', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'due', 'nature', 'topic', 'similar', 'movie', 'mind', 'Woodsman', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'man', 'released', 'prison', 'serving', 'time', 'child', 'molestation', 'direction', 'Nicole', 'Kassell', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', '.Any', 'movie', 'child', 'abuse', 'somehow', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'mixture', 'disgust', 'curiousness', 'engulfs', 'when', 'watch', 'acts', 'protagonist', 'squirm', 'part', 'curious', 'know', 'what', 'made', 'way', 'also', 'wonder', 'way', 'change', 'them.Stevie', 'documentary', 'made', 'Steve', 'James', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'fame', 'story', 'boy', 'Stevie', 'director', 'came', 'know', 'Big', 'Brothers', 'Big', 'Sisters', 'program', 'director', 'returns', 'Southern', 'Illinois', 'nearly', '10', 'years', 'see', 'how', ""'little"", 'brother', 'doing', 'picture', ""n't"", 'pretty.Probably', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'mentoring', 'program', 'nearly', '2', 'years', 'movie', 'little', 'extra', 'special', 'me.Stevie', 'childhood', 'nothing', 'short', 'nightmare', 'absuive', 'violent', 'mom', 'who', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'using', 'outlet', 'anger', 'father', 'who', 'left', 'raped', 'foster', 'home', 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'one', 'set', 'foster', 'parents.Now', 'mid', 'twenties', 'Stevie', 'been', 'arrested', 'numerous', 'times', 'variety', 'crimes', 'course', 'movie', 'also', 'charged', 'molesting', '8-year', 'old', 'cousin', 'movie', 'latter', 'half', 'director', ""n't"", 'use', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'excuse', 'crimes', 'Stevie', 'committed', 'show', 'Stevie', 'really', 'never', 'had', 'fair', 'chance', 'becoming', 'real', 'person.There', 'are', 'variety', 'characters', 'who', 'appear', 'landscape', 'trailer', 'parks', 'rural', 'towns', 'Bernice', 'Stevie', 'mom', 'who', 'finally', 'home', 'Brenda', 'Stevie', 'sister', 'husband', 'who', 'care', 'Stevie', 'flaws', 'Stevie', 'girlfriend', 'Tonya', 'who', 'Stevie', 'same.Quite', 'few', 'critics', 'movie', 'have', 'criticized', 'director', 'being', 'too', 'involved', 'movie', 'according', 'are', 'overlooking', 'fact', 'Steven', 'story', 'extent', 'too', 'part', 'Stevie', 'life', 'story', 'not', 'quite', 'complete', 'it.The', 'movie', 'Stevie', 'being', 'sent', 'prison', '10', 'years', 'molestation', 'charges.A', 'moving', 'depiction', 'intricacies', 'human', 'nature', 'whole', 'bunch', 'questions.What', 'Stevie', 'mom', 'was', 'better', 'What', 'Steven', 'had', 'been', 'mentor', 'longer', 'What', 'Stevie', 'favorite', 'foster', 'family', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'longer', 'Well', '.I', 'guess', 'will', 'never', 'know.It', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'will', 'react', 'too', 'saw', 'same', 'bleak', 'picture', 'mentee', '10', 'years', 'now']",Stevie VHS
759484,A3MYY88NLEJ8Y3,B00009XN4E,Diane Moore,"[35, 37]","Steve James, the director of Hoop Dreams, comes back to rural Illinois to make a movie about the little boy who became a man, Stevie Fielding. Steve J was his &quot;Big Brother&quot; once upon a time. He grew up with a mother that didn't want him, never knew his birth father, had a past of being abused and neglected, and basically was passed around all of the foster homes in Illinois.The movie focuses partially on the trouble that Stevie has gotten into over the years, and the pending prison time he may have to do, because of some alleged crime he had committed during filming.Stevie's life is a train wreck, impossible to turn away from. It is obvious that he has had severe emotional scars that have traveled with him into adulthood, and sometimes he just seems like a 28 year old child. He doesn't want to take responsibility for anything he has done. His life is an open book to those he talks to, as if he doesn't have any remorse for the major and minor crimes he has committed.When you meet his mother, you start to understand where the attitude stems from. This is a woman, who beat him when he was a child, couldn't handle him herself, and turned him over to his grandma, who wasn't really his blood grandmother at all, but his step-dad's mother. The mother feels that people are constantly blaming her, for things past and present. It does seem though, that she tries to reconcile with Stevie and her daughter (who she has caused similar harm) throughout the film. Maybe she realized that she has made some mistakes in the past and she is ready to fess up. Maybe she feels guilt. I think a lot of the people involved feel guilt, including Steve J.I really liked the honesty that went into it. Steve J. is like a Mr. Rogers, who is so sweet and kind, he seems a little timid at times, but very truthful. He asks Stevie, &quot;do you feel that I abandoned you, when I moved away and stopped visiting you?&quot; He was ready for the answer. I think that he's trying to make up for leaving him, because maybe he thinks that if he didn't leave him, Stevie wouldn't have turned out the way that he did.For children that have had such a harsh childhood, is there anything you can really do for them in adulthood that will bring back the trust that they have lost? I really don't know. Stevie seems to avoid showing emotion, he never cried once that I could see. At the same time, he seems to care about those close to him, including his girlfriend, who is disabled, but is clearly making better choices than him.I really loved Judy (the director's wife) in the film. Knowing her job description and what Stevie allegedly did, she seems to really care about him, and wants to help him. Whether or not Stevie is affected by any of the people who seem to care about him, I couldn't tell. He continually made bad choices, and his temper seemed to go up and down like a rollercoaster. One thing I will give him credit for, is the fact that he never laid a hand on his current fiance/girlfriend, because in his short-lived past marriage, he used to beat his wife. You realize that there are some mistakes that he has learned from.Towards the end, Stevie leaves the house and climbs a tree, and it once again reminds me that he is a child. What happens when a child does something so bad that it's hard to forgive? Can you separate the behavior from the child? I think that's something that I struggled with, while I was viewing the film.Like all good things, this had to come to an end. Not to spoil things, but, it didn't end happily. No matter what happens, it's good to know that people really do care about him, even though it he didn't find this out for many, many years.",5,Couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen...,1071878400,"12 20, 2003",2003,3679,"['Steve', 'James', 'director', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'back', 'rural', 'Illinois', 'make', 'movie', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'became', 'man', 'Stevie', 'Fielding', 'Steve', 'J', 'was', 'quot', 'Big', 'Brother', 'quot', 'once', 'time', 'grew', 'up', 'mother', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'never', 'knew', 'birth', 'father', 'had', 'past', 'being', 'abused', 'neglected', 'basically', 'was', 'passed', 'foster', 'homes', 'Illinois.The', 'movie', 'partially', 'trouble', 'Stevie', 'gotten', 'years', 'pending', 'prison', 'time', 'may', 'have', 'do', 'alleged', 'crime', 'had', 'committed', 'filming.Stevie', 'life', 'train', 'wreck', 'impossible', 'turn', 'away', 'obvious', 'had', 'severe', 'emotional', 'scars', 'have', 'traveled', 'adulthood', 'sometimes', 'just', '28', 'year', 'old', 'child', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'responsibility', 'anything', 'done', 'life', 'open', 'book', ""n't"", 'have', 'remorse', 'major', 'minor', 'crimes', 'committed.When', 'meet', 'mother', 'start', 'understand', 'where', 'attitude', 'woman', 'who', 'beat', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'turned', 'grandma', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'blood', 'grandmother', 'step-dad', 'mother', 'mother', 'people', 'are', 'constantly', 'blaming', 'things', 'past', 'present', 'seem', 'reconcile', 'Stevie', 'daughter', 'who', 'caused', 'similar', 'harm', 'film', 'Maybe', 'realized', 'made', 'mistakes', 'past', 'ready', 'fess', 'up', 'Maybe', 'guilt', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'involved', 'feel', 'guilt', 'including', 'Steve', 'J.I', 'really', 'liked', 'honesty', 'went', 'Steve', 'J.', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'who', 'so', 'sweet', 'kind', 'little', 'timid', 'times', 'very', 'truthful', 'Stevie', 'quot', 'do', 'feel', 'abandoned', 'when', 'moved', 'away', 'stopped', 'visiting', 'quot', 'was', 'ready', 'answer', 'think', 'trying', 'make', 'up', 'leaving', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'Stevie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'children', 'have', 'had', 'harsh', 'childhood', 'there', 'anything', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'adulthood', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'trust', 'have', 'lost', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Stevie', 'avoid', 'showing', 'emotion', 'never', 'cried', 'could', 'see', 'same', 'time', 'care', 'close', 'including', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'disabled', 'clearly', 'making', 'better', 'choices', 'him.I', 'really', 'loved', 'Judy', 'director', 'wife', 'film', 'Knowing', 'job', 'description', 'what', 'Stevie', 'allegedly', 'did', 'really', 'care', 'help', 'not', 'Stevie', 'affected', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'care', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'continually', 'made', 'bad', 'choices', 'temper', 'seemed', 'go', 'up', 'down', 'rollercoaster', 'One', 'thing', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'fact', 'never', 'laid', 'hand', 'current', 'fiance/girlfriend', 'short-lived', 'past', 'marriage', 'used', 'beat', 'wife', 'realize', 'are', 'mistakes', 'learned', 'from.Towards', 'end', 'Stevie', 'house', 'climbs', 'tree', 'once', 'again', 'child', 'What', 'when', 'child', 'something', 'so', 'bad', 'hard', 'forgive', 'Can', 'separate', 'behavior', 'child', 'think', 'something', 'struggled', 'was', 'viewing', 'film.Like', 'good', 'things', 'had', 'come', 'end', 'Not', 'spoil', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'happily', 'matter', 'what', 'good', 'know', 'people', 'really', 'do', 'care', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'many', 'many', 'years']",Stevie VHS
759485,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00009XN4E,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[8, 9]","Steve James, the director of this exceptional documentary, has had a colorful career. He has directed a few feature films, but most often he returns to the cinematic form that he succeeded at best--the documentary. His biggest hit, in 1994, was HOOP DREAMS. STEVIE won a lot of accolades at Sundance in 2002, when it was released. James started filming it in 1995, and had to come back to it several times, while he worked on ""money"" projects to feed his family.In 1985, as a college student, James was a Big Brother, and he was paired up with Stephen Dale Fielding, a very troubled 11-year old. Stevie was very disruptive and difficult to work with. Soon after, James graduated, and moved to Chicago, where he began his career as filmmaker and documentarian. In 1995, flush with the success of HOOP DREAMS, James returned to Pomona, Illinois, and looked up Stevie. He was greeted warily by a 21-year old shirtless youth, with thinning haystack hair, jail tattoos, oversized glasses, a Harley ballcap, and a cruel smirk. STEVIE was conceived as a film that would illustrate how society had failed this young man, but this raw reunion left James quite shaken. It took him two years to return with the energy and funding to continue filming.By 1997, Stephen had taken the storyline off in a different direction, to a much darker place. He was in jail, accused of molesting an 8-year old girl that he had been babysitting. He had written a ""confession"" to the police. Later, after he got out on bail, while waiting for his trial, he pleaded innocent to all charges. The court, and his lawyer, offered him a ""deal"". If he were to plead guilty, and he would accept counseling, he could get off on probation, with just the time served. He turned down the deal.Watching his eyes as he turned down the legal deal, one could sense the thickness of his arrogance, and the density of his ignorance. Like a child, he did not want to admit his guilt. He would deal with it by just denying it. And, of course, if he were ever convicted of the crime--he planned to commit suicide,"" taking a few cops with me.""  This was further proof of his naivete and immaturity. Stevie's crime catapulted this film into a downward spiral, dead-stick, right into the ground. It could go nowhere else.Stephen's family and friends were the stuff of Faulkner fiction, the characters written about by Horton Foote, and other dramatic authors. Incest, abuse, rapes, beatings, foster homes, juvenile detention, reform schools, and then jail--these were the ingredients of Stephen's life. Did society let him down, and did the system let him slip through the cracks? Probably. Was he abused by his own mother, and by scores of foster parents--yes.Was he then blameless as he turned into a shiftless drunken bully and thief? No, would be my view. As a kid, ""Troublemaker"" became his identity--his child's way of receiving attention and respect of the wrong kind from the wrong people. But it was his choice to become incorrigible, and to selfishly pursue his own needs regardless--even to the point of an incidence of child molestation.As an audience, we were like passengers on a runaway train, white-knuckling our grasp on the seat in front of us, silently screaming as it thundered inexorably toward the end of the line, and an almost certain crash. It finally did. We were safe. We survived, but I doubt that Stevie did. It has been two years since he was placed in the penitentiary. He has probably been devoured by his own demons, or by the denizens of darkness that he was forced to lie down with.",4,Becoming Barabbas,1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,3566,"['Steve', 'James', 'director', 'exceptional', 'documentary', 'had', 'colorful', 'career', 'directed', 'few', 'feature', 'films', 'most', 'often', 'cinematic', 'form', 'succeeded', 'best', 'documentary', 'biggest', 'hit', '1994', 'was', 'HOOP', 'DREAMS', 'STEVIE', 'won', 'lot', 'accolades', 'Sundance', '2002', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'James', 'started', 'filming', '1995', 'had', 'come', 'back', 'several', 'times', 'worked', 'money', 'projects', 'feed', 'family.In', '1985', 'college', 'student', 'James', 'was', 'Big', 'Brother', 'was', 'paired', 'up', 'Stephen', 'Dale', 'Fielding', 'very', 'troubled', '11-year', 'old', 'Stevie', 'was', 'very', 'disruptive', 'difficult', 'work', 'Soon', 'James', 'graduated', 'moved', 'Chicago', 'where', 'began', 'career', 'filmmaker', 'documentarian', '1995', 'flush', 'success', 'HOOP', 'DREAMS', 'James', 'returned', 'Pomona', 'Illinois', 'looked', 'up', 'Stevie', 'was', 'greeted', 'warily', '21-year', 'old', 'shirtless', 'youth', 'thinning', 'haystack', 'hair', 'jail', 'tattoos', 'oversized', 'glasses', 'Harley', 'ballcap', 'cruel', 'smirk', 'STEVIE', 'was', 'conceived', 'film', 'would', 'illustrate', 'how', 'society', 'had', 'failed', 'young', 'man', 'raw', 'reunion', 'left', 'James', 'quite', 'shaken', 'took', 'two', 'years', 'return', 'energy', 'funding', 'continue', 'filming.By', '1997', 'Stephen', 'had', 'taken', 'storyline', 'off', 'different', 'direction', 'much', 'darker', 'place', 'was', 'jail', 'accused', 'molesting', '8-year', 'old', 'girl', 'had', 'been', 'babysitting', 'had', 'written', 'confession', 'police', 'Later', 'got', 'out', 'bail', 'waiting', 'trial', 'pleaded', 'innocent', 'charges', 'court', 'lawyer', 'offered', 'deal', 'were', 'plead', 'guilty', 'would', 'accept', 'counseling', 'could', 'get', 'off', 'probation', 'just', 'time', 'served', 'turned', 'down', 'deal.Watching', 'eyes', 'turned', 'down', 'legal', 'deal', 'one', 'could', 'sense', 'thickness', 'arrogance', 'density', 'ignorance', 'child', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'admit', 'guilt', 'would', 'deal', 'just', 'denying', 'course', 'were', 'ever', 'convicted', 'crime', 'planned', 'commit', 'suicide', 'taking', 'few', 'cops', 'was', 'further', 'proof', 'naivete', 'immaturity', 'Stevie', 'crime', 'catapulted', 'film', 'downward', 'spiral', 'dead-stick', 'right', 'ground', 'could', 'go', 'nowhere', 'else.Stephen', 'family', 'friends', 'were', 'stuff', 'Faulkner', 'fiction', 'characters', 'written', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'other', 'dramatic', 'authors', 'Incest', 'abuse', 'rapes', 'beatings', 'foster', 'homes', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'reform', 'schools', 'then', 'jail', 'were', 'ingredients', 'Stephen', 'life', 'Did', 'society', 'let', 'down', 'did', 'system', 'let', 'slip', 'cracks', 'Probably', 'abused', 'own', 'mother', 'scores', 'foster', 'parents', 'yes.Was', 'then', 'blameless', 'turned', 'shiftless', 'drunken', 'bully', 'thief', 'No', 'would', 'be', 'view', 'kid', 'Troublemaker', 'became', 'identity', 'child', 'way', 'receiving', 'attention', 'respect', 'wrong', 'kind', 'wrong', 'people', 'was', 'choice', 'become', 'incorrigible', 'selfishly', 'pursue', 'own', 'needs', 'regardless', 'even', 'point', 'incidence', 'child', 'molestation.As', 'audience', 'were', 'like', 'passengers', 'runaway', 'train', 'white-knuckling', 'grasp', 'seat', 'front', 'silently', 'screaming', 'thundered', 'inexorably', 'end', 'line', 'almost', 'certain', 'crash', 'finally', 'did', 'were', 'safe', 'survived', 'doubt', 'Stevie', 'did', 'been', 'two', 'years', 'was', 'placed', 'penitentiary', 'probably', 'been', 'devoured', 'own', 'demons', 'denizens', 'darkness', 'was', 'forced', 'lie', 'down']",Stevie VHS

Jacobs,"[6, 6]","This is a powerful and moving documentary about a college student who served as a Big Brother to a troubled youth, then returned years later to make a film and really get to know him.  During the filming, Stevie (the troubled youth and focus of the film) is charged with a serious crime and the film takes us through the effects of this, on Stevie, his family and friends, and on the director.  By introducing viewers to the characters in Stevie's life, the movie presents an amazing portrait of growing up poor and the constraints of average life in low-income rural America.  It also demonstrates the detrimental impact that can be had on young lives when individuals within a community fail to love and commit to children.  It makes viewers question the influence of heridity, upbringing, and individual choice in the formation of one's life journey.

When the director was in college, he was a &quot;big brother&quot; to the little boy but later moved away.  After ten years, he returned to meet up with Stevie, now an in his twenties.  Stevie had been in every foster home in Southern Illinois and got in trouble in all of them.  When we meet him, he is living with his step-grandmother, hates his mother, has had a short abusive marriage, has never held a steady job, and has a mentally retarded girlfriend.The film follows this troubled young man for 4-1/2 years and the director cannot help but take a good hard look at his own role in the film he is making.  Right in front of us we see the result of years of neglect and abuse of the boy, now a man.  He's angry, abuses alcohol and is sometimes violent.  The setting is rural Illinois, a place of trailer camps, fundamentalist churches, fishing creeks, white supremacist culture, pickup trucks and unemployment.  With the exception of Stevie's half-sister, who has a happy marriage and eventually has a baby, most of the people are sad and angry.  It is not a pretty place to live.The film is 145 minutes long but it never lags.  I was completely caught up in Stevie's life, my feelings ranging from pity to anger as it gradually became quite clear that Stevie's character was set for life and that there would be little, if any change.  When he is charged with a crime, we see him fighting the justice system.  Eventually, he loses.  This is not surprising.If this were fiction, there would be some sort of contrived ending.  But this is a documentary and all it does is tell the truth.  I loved this fine film.  It's full of honesty and courage.  And I applaud the filmmaker for making it.  I highly recommended it.

Whereas a lot of people walk away from this film feeling like Steve used Stevie's situation as an opportunity, I felt that the film was more of a reflection of how he feels that he's failed his ""little brother"". It would be easier for James to edit himself out of the film, to focus solely on Stevie and to take advantage of his situation, but instead he references himself shouldering some of the blame for the situation.

759498,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B00009XN4E,stoic,"[0, 0]","Way back in the early-1980s, Steve James was a student at Southern Illinois University. James became involved in the Big Brothers, Big Sisters program and worked with a child named Stevie Fielding. Eventually, James moved to Chicago, lost touch with Stevie, and became a documentary filmmaker. (He directed Hoop Dreams). In the 1990s, James - who felt guilty about abandoning Stevie - returned to find out what had become of Stevie and to make a documentary about it.James learns that Stevie's life is an absolute mess. In his twenties, Stevie is unemployed, in trouble with the law, and in a family that is beyond dysfunctional. A large portion of the film is devoted to explaining Stevie's life experiences.Stevie was a boy nobody wanted. He knows nothing of his father. Shortly after Stevie was born, his mother dumped him on her boyfriend's parents. So, Stevie was raised by his step-grandparents. Eventually, the family put Stevie in Illinois' foster care system, but Stevie's behavior made it impossible for him to stay with a foster family for long. In the end, Stevie ended up in group homes (where he was assaulted) and in a mental hospital.The documentary progresses over several years and - in the course of the film - Stevie eventually stands accused of horrific crimes. Filmmaker James wonders whether Stevie's life might have been different had James stayed to help him. In one scene, Stevie describes how he went to the post office day after day to look for a Christmas card from James - but the card never came.Stevie is a long film - about 2 hours, but it is terrific. Over the course of the film, the viewer reflects on what it means to be a good or a bad person; Stevie is both likeable and terrible. To James' credit, he resists the urge to tell the viewer what to think. With Stevie, there are no easy answers - just layer upon layer of complexity.In short, I thought that Stevie was terrific.
