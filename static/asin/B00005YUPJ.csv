691070,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005YUPJ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[8, 9]","This film took me two days to decide whether I liked it or not.  When the final credits rolled, rather creatively at that, I couldn't figure out if this was pure brilliance on the part of Richard Linklater, or if it was nothing more than a group of friends trying to make an independent film.  I could not decide.  I even listened to the audio commentary of Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater to see if I could capture their mood of the film to hopefully influence mine.  While it was a very interesting audio commentary, it only provided more indecisiveness.  After thinking about this for two days, I finally thought about it long enough and realized that if a film makes you think for two days after viewing, there has to be something spectacular about it, and there was.  After two days I was able to put my finger on it.  You had a very chilling story, a deeply disturbing confession, a powerhouse of acting by Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman, and then there was Ethan Hawke.  I put him aside because it was his acting, his portrayal of Vince that took away the inches of film that nearly made it into perfection.  Let me explain.This is a story, that on the surface seems small, is very large in structure.  While its only setting is inside a motel room, the written word by Stephen Belber transforms this into a thrilling drama about past lives and future consequences.  From the opening scene of Hawke throwing his beers into the motel door until the final dramatic conclusion where Vince is caught up in the web of his own lies, we never really know anything about him.  Leonard talks briefly about what he is doing and why he is currently single, but we never really get to know Ethan's character.  This is what muddled in my mind for those two days, I continually had to ask myself who Vince really was.  Was he a friend trying to help Leonard with a guilty conscious, or was he on the side of Amy trying to give her the conclusion that she wanted.  Who knows?  I think I needed more structure with Ethan's Vince.  We needed more from Linklater to help us understand this self-appointed villain, or even more from Ethan to reveal his ultimate purpose.  Instead, what occurred was Ethan just jumping around being annoying with no purpose except what you could hear Linklater telling him.  Here is what I could hear: ""Ok, Ethan, your purpose in this scene is to ensure that Leonard doesn't leave, do whatever it takes"".  Ethan takes this direction and adds a couple of swear words and uses screaming to keep him in the room instead of countering with more plot.  Does this make sense?  I felt like I knew why Leonard and Thurman were there in that room, but WHY Ethan was bringing them together was never told.  I know that perhaps it was left up to the viewer, but this story needed a hint.  It needed to provide some reasoning for the situation.  I felt Ethan held us back from learning that.  Someone else in the role may have done better, but Ethan just felt lost and stagy.As I said before, Leonard and Thurman really carried this film on their shoulders.  I was impressed to see Leonard taking such heavy work, but his true acting ability really came forth.  The same goes for Uma who successfully took the idea of ""husband and wife"" away while working with Ethan.  I was concerned that it would be a factor in Tape, but luckily these two were able to keep their characters separate.  The chemistry that Leonard and Thurman had on screen was shattering.  I found myself holding my breath during their parts from both emotion and the tension that they created.  Outside of Ethan, they did a great job.The story was a very tight story.  I loved being brought into the middle of this controversy and seeing that a world can be created and destroyed in a hotel room.  I thought that concept was a hard one to tackle, but Stephen Belber (who also wrote the play) did a fantastic job of eliminating the corporate element and giving us the pure human drama that exists between these characters.  Linklater likewise really pulls this film together well by keeping the tensions high and elaborate as our characters progress through the phases of this predicament.  The only trouble I had with Linklater's direction deals with his swirling camera.  Whenever two people were talking to each other we found ourselves swirling between the two instead of using one large shot or quick cuts.  I thought this was annoying at times, and quite dizzying.  It detracted from the words that the actors were speaking and from the impact of the story.  That is my only critique of Linklater's direction, which was nearly flawless.Overall, this was an impressive and very intense drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat due to its strong reality and human element.  It took me a while for me to realize this, and will probably take some time for it to sink into your mind, but that is the nature of this film.  It is created to leave this lasting impression on your mind and to haunt your mind during your next visit with friends.  I think Linklater did an excellent job with the material that he was handed, proving that his work could be compared to early Cameron Crowe material.  Leonard and Thurman explode onto the scene, while Hawke leaves a bit more to be desired.  I do believe that Linklater should have considered another actor for his role.  Either way, this was a great film that took away the classic Hollywood backdrop and gave us nothing but 100% pure acting.Grade: **** out of *****",4,Motel room ignites past...,1105833600,"01 16,

But the dialogue and the delivery of Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard as two rival friends frequently had me laughing out loud.  Hawke's character, Vince is such a wonderfully insufferable jerk: coked-out, hostile, santimonious, but oddly articulate and resourceful when he needs to be.  When he verbally batters John (Leonard), his old friend, rival, and whom he accuses of raping his childhood sweetheart Amy (Uma Thurman) you can't help but laugh at his verbal astuteness.  Hawke's performance is awesome- spasmodic and winning and funny.  Robert Sean Leonard has less to do because his character is a more obvious jerk, but he captures his snobby elitism well.  The climax in which Amy enters the claustrophobic motel room that serves as the film's setting, kind of deconstructs, twisting over itself so many times that we stop caring.

There was tremendous acting and energy in the film that made you almost forget the dinginess of the setting.  When Uma Thurman blew in, it was like a breath of fresh air.  Although the juxtapositioning of the actors was good when there were two in the room, three really brought out the  film's artistry by the careful use of limited physical space. I also loved the projection of a drug user/seller with a brain--albeit, a slightly twisted one. Unfortunately, I thought the ending was too contrived and trivialized.  I would have preferred an ending where the characters all learned something from the experience.

691076,A14SO48SN83R3U,B00005YUPJ,Darren,"[2, 2]","With the acting expertise of only three actors and entirely set in a motel room, Richard Linklater presents an awesome adaptation of this one-act play. Linklater does an excellent job of creating a sense of claustrophobia and psychological drama in the motel room as the characters become sucked in by Ethan Hawke's character and ultimately involved in a triangular struggle of mental manipulation, control and competition of authenticity.Once you get beyond the claustrophobia of the room, the viewer is then subjected to a form of mental claustrophobia. At times, it was very frustrating to see each of the characters struggling to communicate with each other. At times it seemed like they were all talking different languages to each other or weren't truly listening to each other. At other times it seemed as if each character simply had their own agenda. The movie makes it clear that we sometimes create our own mental prison. There were quite a few times, when the tense dialogue and emotional frustration between Hawke and Leonard got so uncomfortable that I wished Leonard's character would have just left the motel room...but then we would be left with no film! Ironically, his character has a few opportunities to leave, comes close on another occasion and on yet another occasion where he actually does get out the door, shortly returns!The movie develops even further when Uma Thurman's character enters the room.  Tape does an exellent job at illustrating how one event can be perceived and interpreted differently by three individuals, each with their own emotional issues and baggage and individual ideas about how the world works, or is supposed to work. Is there one absolute truth or is each truth in the mind of the individual?The dialogue between Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Uma Thurman works well in vividly illustrating how the human psyche deals with intense feelings of envy, jealousy, pride and guilt. The acting of all three is magnificent.Ethan Hawke's acting seems effortless in this film.

Gentile,"[18, 24]","I don't have much of anything witty to say about this film, I can only say that it is one of those rare films where the superb acting just keeps you transfixed. This movie about three high school friends of ten years prior, who have some very unresolved issues, takes place in just one hotel room. It is so real that you feel like an eavesdropper. I really can't stand about 95% of the movies made in the last 15 years, with very few exceptions. I don't ""get"" the stars. I am SO sick of Tom Cruise's,  Tom Hanks, Jack Nicholson's, and Julia Roberts trademark smirks and quirks (aren't we CUTE?""!) that they have marketed into  ridiculously lucrative careers of boring movies that are interchangeable and unmemorable. I tend to put all the actors of today down. Watching Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Robert Sean Leonard, as in this fim, makes me realize that I am sometimes wrong in my summation about the actors of today. They are so astoundingly real, that I can't honestly be objective about the storyline of this film, because I was so impressed by their performances. They are among the best actors of today. I recently discovered Uma Thurman, later than everyone else, in ""Hysterical Blindness"" on HBO, and was just amazed at her performance. I happened upon that film, as with this one, by accident. That she not only stars in this film, but, co-stars with such an incredible actor, Ethan Hawke, who also happens to be her husband, well, let's just say that it's a most wonderful discovery for me. It drew me in in the first minute, and, never let go until the end. I realize that these actors have all been around for a while, and certainly I am ""late"" in discovering their talents. I guess I need to open myself up to some more recent flicks. It's just that, when I do, they are almost always just plain lousy.  These three actors make this film  one of those  rare occurrences of being overwhelmed by real, unaffected talent. There is not a hint that they are ""acting."" What a pleasure to, finally, observe art, not just phony box-office garbage. I could drone on and on, just repeating myself, so, I'll stop. I just highly recommend this movie to anyone who is as hungry as I am for an intelligent, non-special effects, skilled film that totally involves you. I really need to watch it again, as I was so caught up in their portrayals, I'm sure there's some things I missed. I am now a ""fan"" of these actors, if you want to call me that. But, I don't want to know anything about their personal lives. I don't want to watch them on ""Entertainment Tonight"" or read about them in ""People"" magazine.

Not often can a director pull off an adaptation of a one act off-off Broadway theater piece into a full feature movie yet Linklater manages to do just that. So did the actors; all three roles required intelligence, emotional sensitivity and instinct that one certainly does not expect from Hollywood  icons. In some way this film is already (as it should be) a classic. Myself  I  kept being reminded throughout of Bergman (&amp; Uma certainly made me think of Liv Ullman).I was also reminded of high school, its pressures and bittersweet romances that can never be forgotten and that, for better or worse, defined life paths for many of us. The first love, the first rejection, the first true friendship...  Linklater shows that  these can coalesce, blend, and differentiate in an elaborate dance of memories and emotions.  What is free will? how do we define ourselves? what is self-respect and how does it stand up to emotional revelations?  Why would one want to stay and face the demons from  one's past rather than flee into the oblivion of worldly &quot;success&quot;?  These are all issues  Linklater and his actors distill into a bewildering and intoxicating beverage that makes for fidgety yet irresistible viewing.A lot  in this movie (like in any good theater) is left unsaid; in other words, it is left to be conveyed by actors'  body language and energetic tone of their emotions.  They succeed spectacularly. This movie should be a required part of curriculum of every acting school worthy of its designation.

691092,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005YUPJ,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 3]","Like ""My Dinner With Andre,"" ""Tape"" is one of those conversation films that zoom by.  It works most of the time.  Director Richard Linklater who directed Hawke in the equally talky ""Before Sunrise"" in 1995 and shared an Oscar nomination with Hawke for the screenplay to its sequel ""Before Sunset"" in 2004 shoots the entire film on digital video, keeping costs down and discovering the cinematic possibilities of low-budget film.  Some of his camera technique of whipping back and forth between the actors is a bit overdone.  Ethan Hawke and co-star Robert Sean Leonard were co-founders of a now defunct New York theatre company called Malaparte and first starred together in ""The Dead Poets Society"" with Robin Williams in 1989.  Leonard also acted in Hawke's debut directing credit ""Chelsea Walls"" along with Hawke's now ex-wife Uma Thurman.  Thurman met Hawke while starring in one of my favorite films about racial intolerance, ""Gattaca,"" in 1997.  So the bottom line is that these three actors and the director have all worked together before, were very comfortable with each other, and it shows on screen.  As Vince, Hawke is not the likeable nice guy that got him his Best Supporting Actor nomination for ""Training Day.""  He's a part-time drug dealer, volunteer fireman, who really hasn't started acting responsibly as an adult.  At least, this is what his buddy Johnny played by Robert Sean Leonard thinks.  Johnny is in town for the premiere of his new independent film at the Lansing film festival and Vincent travels out from Oakland, California to attend.  ""Tape"" really ignited for me when Uma Thurman hit the screen.  She plays Amy who is an assistant district attorney that used to go steady with Vince and made love to Johnny senior year.  Since Thurman appeared in ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and got her Best Supporting Actress nomination for ""Pulp Fiction,"" her career has had its ups like ""Kill Bill"" (parts I & II) & downs ""The Avengers.""  2005 may be her banner year with 5 films out or coming out: ""Be Cool"" with John Travolta, ""The Women"" with Ashley Judd, Sandra Bullock, Meg Ryan & Annette Bening, ""The Producers"" with Nathan Lane & Matthew Broderick, ""Prime"" with Meryl Streep & a cameo in ""Brothers Grimm"" with Heath Ledger & Matt Damon.  However great her 2005 may be, she becomes riveting in this 2001 project. Hawke & Leonard become more interesting with her on screen.  Stephen Belber's one-act play that was adapted into this project shows how some of us grow up after high school & some just move on.  But however that happens, the loves & experiences of those early years have a great impact on how we perceive ourselves & how we approach others.  ""Tape"" is like a walk down memory lane where one does not always wish to promenade.  The ending is a bit open-ended (i.e. Was there an assault or not?) that may drive the more concretely minded up the walls, but has the vague recall of something once true.  A very interesting evening's entertainment.

691093,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B00005YUPJ,M. Burns,"[29, 36]","Alright, I'll just let it fly right now: I don't think I've seen a movie since Dead Poet's Society in which Ethan Hawke doesn't kinda blow. He's not so believable in Linklater's Before Sunrise, got undeserved acclaim for Training Day, and pretty much destroys the art of acting in Taking Lives. So it was a nice surprise to see him not suck after Linklater's fascinating, superbly acted (holy crap, I just said that about an Ethan Hawke movie) Tape, which needs about 20 minutes to get its look-at-me-I'm-a-badass-indie-film-shot-on-DV-with-cool-angles attitude out of its system. But after that, whoa boy. The film takes place entirely in a low-rent motel room where Hawke is staying; his high school pal, played by the underappreciated Robert Sean Leonard (the guy who blew his brains out in DPS), drops by and before you know it, it's less high school reunion and more Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. You see, Hawke's Vince exposes a secret from Leonard's Jon's past and a cunning game of psychological hot potato begins. What impressed me the most about Tape is how it defied my expectations at every point that the movie turned - there are more twists in it than a Hollywood thriller, and the movie becomes so engrossing at points that interest becomes giddiness. But the best thing about Tape is how well its actors (including Uma Thurman, who drops by in a pivotal role) navigate the facial and verbal expressions that would accompany such an encounter. For a low-budget indie that could have been pretentious and silly, this movie is so well-nuanced and executed it'll have you clamoring for more in its all-too-brief 84 minutes.

Just don't expect any big screen histrionics and be prepared for incessant chit-chat with lots of &quot;Why?&quot; and &quot;WHat?&quot; and other logic-numbing trivia, and you'll do fine.But first, the good. Really, hats off to Hawke and Therman (and that other guy) for having the courage to do something like this, all in candid videocam, warts and all. Sans any make up, sans any Gattaca-style golden Fuji reel etc. Just raw dialog between old friends, about an old grudge, in a shoddy motel room.The whole movie veers around a lot of talking in circles, friends questioning perceptions of each other over a shared girlfriend fling in senior year over a decade ago. Frankly, this would have been ok in a theatrical production, but this film errs with its painful camera moves, for e.g., frequent switches to and fro faces of people standing opposite each other, which means you get treated to a lot of viewpoint swings.Secondly, and more importantly, a little bit of unpredictability would have been nice. Anyone with a couple of brain cells could have figured out what was to happen 15 minutes ahead, which is not exactly a very favorable point for a movie.For a full grinding hour, Ethan Hawke and Bob Leonard keep exchanging grinding blither blather, until Ms. Therman slides into the picture (what a respite!) and makes things a little interesting. I cannot imagine any other actress making the theme more watchable than she does, a simple twitch of an eye from her speaks volumes.Yet, overall this film is a grating experience and though the acting is fabulous (I do not imagine too many retakes et al) perhaps Linklater needs to contemplate this abhorrent creation and think about what makes cinema a different medium than stage.",4,"THE GATTACA REUNION, BUT LESS OF HOLLYWOOD THAN U'D IMAGINE",1061683200,"08 24, 2003",2003,1854,"[""'re"", 'crazy', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Uma', 'Therman', 'am', 'off-beat', 'Linklater', 'endeavour', 'may', 'be', 'ride', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'big', 'screen', 'histrionics', 'be', 'prepared', 'incessant', 'chit-chat', 'lots', 'quot', 'Why', 'quot', 'quot', 'WHat', 'quot', 'other', 'logic-numbing', 'trivia', ""'ll"", 'do', 'fine.But', 'first', 'good', 'Really', 'hats', 'off', 'Hawke', 'Therman', 'other', 'guy', 'having', 'courage', 'do', 'something', 'candid', 'videocam', 'warts', 'make', 'up', 'Gattaca-style', 'golden', 'Fuji', 'reel', 'etc', 'Just', 'raw', 'dialog', 'old', 'friends', 'old', 'grudge', 'shoddy', 'motel', 'room.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'veers', 'lot', 'talking', 'circles', 'friends', 'questioning', 'perceptions', 'other', 'shared', 'girlfriend', 'fling', 'senior', 'year', 'decade', 'ago', 'Frankly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ok', 'theatrical', 'production', 'film', 'painful', 'camera', 'moves', 'e.g.', 'frequent', 'switches', 'fro', 'people', 'standing', 'opposite', 'other', 'get', 'treated', 'lot', 'viewpoint', 'swings.Secondly', 'more', 'importantly', 'little', 'bit', 'unpredictability', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Anyone', 'couple', 'brain', 'cells', 'could', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'happen', '15', 'minutes', 'ahead', 'not', 'exactly', 'very', 'favorable', 'point', 'movie.For', 'full', 'grinding', 'hour', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Bob', 'Leonard', 'keep', 'exchanging', 'grinding', 'blither', 'blather', 'Ms.', 'Therman', 'picture', 'what', 'respite', 'things', 'little', 'interesting', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'other', 'actress', 'making', 'theme', 'more', 'watchable', 'simple', 'twitch', 'eye', 'speaks', 'volumes.Yet', 'overall', 'film', 'grating', 'experience', 'acting', 'fabulous', 'do', 'not', 'imagine', 'too', 'many', 'retakes', 'et', 'al', 'perhaps', 'Linklater', 'contemplate', 'abhorrent', 'creation', 'think', 'what', 'cinema', 'different', 'medium', 'stage']",Tape

It's hard not to compare this to other single-room films(a very specific subgenre) like ROPE, SECRET HONOR, or maybe COMING APART, but it still holds up pretty well. Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard are old friends in real life and I think that really helps contribute to this being a believeable and engaging view. It's a really well written film(using Stephen Belber's play), and Linklater gets creative with his two-digital camera set-up. I was suprised that the dvd commentary wasn't really mentioned on the front of the disc(on the back it says &quot;Production Commentary&quot;).  The commentary features Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke-both have many interesting things to say(although it seems that the commentaries were recorded at different times and cut together). I like this trend of Linklater filming plays. Maybe he'll take an  Altman-like turn and do several more(Altman's play-adaptions are pretty cool-I have to cite STREAMERS, FOOL FOR LOVE and COME BACK TO THE FIVE AND DIME JIMMY DEAN, JIMMY DEAN as a few that I really enjoyed).",4,Linklater doubles up and scores twice!,1019088000,"04 18, 2002",2002,1214,"['year', 'saw', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'release', 'excellent', 'animated', 'film-WAKING', 'LIFE', 'also', 'released', 'smaller', 'tenacious', 'film-and', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'hard', 'not', 'compare', 'other', 'single-room', 'films', 'very', 'specific', 'subgenre', 'ROPE', 'SECRET', 'HONOR', 'maybe', 'COMING', 'APART', 'still', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'real', 'life', 'think', 'really', 'contribute', 'being', 'believeable', 'engaging', 'view', 'really', 'well', 'written', 'film', 'using', 'Stephen', 'Belber', 'play', 'Linklater', 'creative', 'two-digital', 'camera', 'set-up', 'was', 'suprised', 'dvd', 'commentary', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'mentioned', 'front', 'disc', 'back', 'quot', 'Production', 'Commentary', 'quot', 'commentary', 'features', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'Ethan', 'Hawke-both', 'have', 'many', 'interesting', 'things', 'say', 'commentaries', 'were', 'recorded', 'different', 'times', 'cut', 'together', 'trend', 'Linklater', 'filming', 'plays', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Altman-like', 'turn', 'do', 'several', 'more', 'Altman', 'play-adaptions', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool-I', 'have', 'cite', 'STREAMERS', 'FOOL', 'FOR', 'LOVE', 'COME', 'BACK', 'TO', 'THE', 'FIVE', 'AND', 'DIME', 'JIMMY', 'DEAN', 'JIMMY', 'DEAN', 'few', 'really', 'enjoyed']",Tape

Movies like ""Slacker"" pushed the boundaries of conventional filmmaking, and took your preconceptions and stomped them to dust.  Even his mainstream breakthrough ""Dazed and Confused"" seemed surreally barebones in its structure.  However, with ""Tape"", Linklater took his style to whole new heights of complex simplicity (yes, that was an intentional oxymoron).Unfolding like a modern day Samuel Beckett play, ""Tape"" revolves entirely around only three characters, and takes place entirely in a hotel room.  The central character, Vince (played brilliantly by Ethan Hawke) is meeting up with two old friends from high school (Uma Thurman and Robert Sean Leonard).  It seems like an innocent friendly reunion at first, but soon it's apparent that Vince has ulterior motives for getting the old gang back together.For its rather sparse arrangement, this is an intense, intelligent, highly complex, and extremely engaging story.  All three performances are great, but Hawke definitely stands out, bringing such vivid dimension to a highly erratic and delightfully devious character.  This is definitely among the best performances I've seen of his.  It's also worth mentioning that this movie was filmed not in a real hotel room, but on a very convincing soundstage.  To those interested in stage design, the attention to detail here is pretty impressive.Like most of Linklater's movies, this is definitely not for everyone, but if you dig his style, you definitely need to see this.",5,Minimalist filmmaking at its best.,1233100800,"01 28, 2009",2009,1561,"['Richard', 'Linklater', 'long', 'been', 'known', 'knack', 'getting', 'lot', 'little', 'Movies', 'Slacker', 'pushed', 'boundaries', 'conventional', 'filmmaking', 'took', 'preconceptions', 'stomped', 'dust', 'Even', 'mainstream', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'seemed', 'surreally', 'barebones', 'structure', 'However', 'Tape', 'Linklater', 'took', 'style', 'whole', 'new', 'heights', 'complex', 'simplicity', 'yes', 'was', 'intentional', 'oxymoron', '.Unfolding', 'modern', 'day', 'Samuel', 'Beckett', 'play', 'Tape', 'revolves', 'entirely', 'only', 'three', 'characters', 'place', 'entirely', 'hotel', 'room', 'central', 'character', 'Vince', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'meeting', 'up', 'two', 'old', 'friends', 'high', 'school', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'innocent', 'friendly', 'reunion', 'first', 'soon', 'apparent', 'Vince', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'getting', 'old', 'gang', 'back', 'rather', 'sparse', 'arrangement', 'intense', 'intelligent', 'highly', 'complex', 'extremely', 'engaging', 'story', 'three', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'Hawke', 'definitely', 'out', 'bringing', 'such', 'vivid', 'dimension', 'highly', 'erratic', 'delightfully', 'devious', 'character', 'definitely', 'best', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'not', 'real', 'hotel', 'room', 'very', 'convincing', 'soundstage', 'interested', 'stage', 'design', 'attention', 'detail', 'here', 'pretty', 'most', 'Linklater', 'movies', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'dig', 'style', 'definitely', 'need', 'see']",Tape

Of course Uma Thurman is wickedly brilliant as the supposed victim who turns a new leaf and leaves a few surprises.
