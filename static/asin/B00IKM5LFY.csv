Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[4, 5]","Not to be confused with the other &#34;Mischief Night,&#34; which is about a blind girl trapped in her house by a stalker, this movie is about a babysitter who is being stalked. Sounds corny, but it really isn't, as the plot twists make this movie anything but ordinary. Malcolm McDowell makes a few appearances, but is not really in the film all that much. The acting is good, pacing is decent, but this is not a typical horror film. With the exception of a few violent scenes, it certainly is not a &#34;slasher&#34; film.

That was quickly dispelled and I realized it was going to be more of a ""Heathers"" like experience. For those who weren't around then, Heathers was a black humoresque flick, in the 80s, that became an instant cult classic. Black humor, macabre humor, meant something different back then. More like ironic and twisted/perverse than shets and giggles. I'm not saying the plot or style of the film is anything like Heathers. The experience brought it to mind. That is all. The acting and camera work were fine in this flick. Technically, it was sound. I knew what was coming down the pike by the early middle but it was still entertaining. At first, I was thinking, ""No, please, no, don't go there."" But by the time it did, I felt like it worked. So, there's my 2 cents.

It takes place the night before Halloween ( Mischief Night ), but it feels like it is Halloween during the movie ! With all the great Halloween decor every where.To me that is important atmosphere can really add to a movie, and in this one with the Halloween props, pumpkin, decor.... you do feel like hey this is right around Halloween for sure !!!! It starts out like your typical slasher movie,girl babysitting, crazy killer wearing a mask, after her ,  BUT it takes a turn ! a big turn, and has some GREAT twists !!!! ( TO ME ). I honestly give it 5 stars.  I am a big fan of Malcolm McDowell, but he is only in this a very, short time. Maybe 3 mins tops. Also wanted to add to me the movie has very solid acting in it.I mainly collect Halloween horror movies, and must say I am happy to have this in my collection.So if you like slasher  movies, if you like Halloween horror movies, and if you like a different twist on it,a much different twist then most slasher films I say check it out !",5,AWESOME Halloween type slahser movie WITH TWISTS,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,1137,"['Ok', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'fancy', 'review', 'try', 'act', 'am', 'critic', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'here', 'LOL', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'imo', 'place', 'night', 'Halloween', 'Mischief', 'Night', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'great', 'Halloween', 'decor', 'where.To', 'important', 'atmosphere', 'can', 'really', 'add', 'movie', 'one', 'Halloween', 'props', 'pumpkin', 'decor', 'do', 'feel', 'hey', 'right', 'Halloween', 'sure', 'out', 'typical', 'slasher', 'movie', 'girl', 'babysitting', 'crazy', 'killer', 'wearing', 'mask', 'BUT', 'turn', 'big', 'turn', 'GREAT', 'twists', 'TO', 'ME', 'honestly', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'only', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'Maybe', '3', 'mins', 'tops', 'Also', 'wanted', 'add', 'movie', 'very', 'solid', 'acting', 'it.I', 'mainly', 'collect', 'Halloween', 'horror', 'movies', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'happy', 'have', 'collection.So', 'like', 'slasher', 'movies', 'like', 'Halloween', 'horror', 'movies', 'like', 'different', 'twist', 'much', 'different', 'twist', 'then', 'most', 'slasher', 'films', 'say', 'check', 'out']",N/A

Just when I think I have a genre solidified, an inventive filmmaker comes along and completely changes the game.  Such is the case with MISCHIEF NIGHT.  Director Travis Baker (no relation) turns the babysitter-versus-slasher concept upside down with this slick fright-fest, and the result is a terrifying trek into the bizarre!Don&#8217;t confuse this After Dark Original film with the 2013 movie of the same title.  The two are very different and have nothing to do with one another.  But be sure to check this one out, as it is a very original take on an existing horror sub-genre.MISCHIEF NIGHT starts out like any other film in this category, with the proverbial babysitter home alone with her charge while the parents are away.  When strange things begin to happen, she reacts as every sitter does:  locking the doors and windows while arming herself.  But this is where the similarities end; the audience quickly realizes this girl is not like others before her&#8230;not by a long shot.The film is made well and looks good onscreen.  The production value seems high, and there&#8217;s really not a specific area where anything is lacking.  The film overall is solid and moves at a nice pace.The cast in MISCHIEF NIGHT do a great job with their roles, which is one of the reasons this movie succeeds.  I always enjoy seeing Malcolm McDowell onscreen, and this film is no exception.  To be honest, he&#8217;s not in the film that much, but enough so to give him due credit.  And I have to commend Brooke Ann Smith with her portrayal of the main character, Kaylie.  I have not seen Smith&#8217;s work before, but she plays this multilayered character with ease.  I enjoyed her performance and look forward to seeing more of what she can do.The special effects are pretty good as well, and there&#8217;s even a nice bit of gore (albeit a small dose).  I would have preferred more carnage from a slasher flick, but what we get to see is nice.  I particularly like the teenage prick that gets disemboweled.  He definitely gets what he deserves, and the effects do the scene justice.Th story of MISCHIEF NIGHT is what really wins here, though.  I love how this film takes the traditional babysitter slasher and completely changes it up.  I didn&#8217;t see this twist coming, and it makes for an entertaining thrill ride throughout the film.MISCHIEF NIGHT is a big win for me, and I recommend giving it a look.

The director got that on film. She's model beautiful, but that's never enough. Whether it was her and we have a new star on our hands or the direction was what made her captivating, the point I'm trying to make is that with all the scripts out there trying to make money instead of concentrating of filmmaking, even if this was really the beautiful psychopath-centric plot, it at least tried to get something right. And it did do that. I would have written more David Lynch into it, but I would be up against the money suckers telling me to tone down the artistic attempts. So, the whole film just squeezed by with a lot of potential lost, but with some success, namely, Brooke Anne Smith. Heck, at least she was watchable which is better than most crap out there created by the money makers which most often won't let anything great happen. I gave it 4 stars because I wanted to watch Brooke Anne Smith and that's more than what most films have made me want to do. Film should be art and art is partly about aesthetics, so she brought that to the screen. Ya, ya... I know films are meant to be more, but at least she carried the film. Sad to have to settle for that. Throughout film history MOST films have been crap. It will always be a rare moment when a great film is made and many years can go by before that's accomplished.
