I do one cardio and her strength training in the morning for 3 days on each segment. Then do her yoga in the evening. I am very impressed by the result that I have got so far. I also love the fact that she is real and do the workout with you rather just stand there and direct. It like having your own personal trainer right at your house.

1653500,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B00D3S7810,Leanne,"[73, 78]","I've been doing Zuzana's workouts for a few years (ever since she helped co-found Body Rock TV), and just love how encouraging and motivational she is! I've left reviews for her other two DVDs (theZCUT Power Cardio Series 3 Dvd SetandZCUT Power Yoga Vol 1, which I just love, and know that this series will also become a favorite of mine.Unlike the Power Cardio Series, this new series doesn't come in hard DVD cases, but rather the thin envelope sleeves that the Power Yoga workout came in.  I like this since I'm running out of room in the bookcases where I keep my workout DVDs.Zuzana's (whose nickname is Zuzka, which is why you'll see her name both ways) workouts are always short and yet intense, allowing you to get a great workout in a short amount of time. The Power Cardio Series was focused on cardio workouts, but this new series uses weights and resistance.The three DVDs contain a total of 12 all-new workouts and a bonus workout (that is just under 12 minutes long). The DVDs are pressed DVDs, and not DVD-r, and are good quality; I was able to play them on my laptop and my regular DVD player.Each of the three disks contains a Warm-Up (about 6:50 minutes) and a Cooldown (about 8:50 minutes) that you can select to do at the beginning or end of your workout. Another nice feature is that each separate workout has two options:  a breakdown of the workout + the workout *or* the workout only.  This is great for when you know the routine and just want to jump right in.When you select the Breakdown option for each workout, the first thing you'll see on the screen (as with the Cardio Series) is a listing of the exercises you'll be doing and a small screen that shows Zuzana doing the workout. If you choose the breakdown option, she'll also mention tips for how much weight to use and will include form pointers.The moves include both weighted and non-weighted moves.  For instance, in the Bonus workout, she has you do burpees, then grab a dumbbell and do weighted one-legged pistol squats, then chair hops, then dive bombers. Because she integrates cardio and plyo moves into each workout, I can see that your heart rate will stay elevated the entire time.There is impact in a lot of the moves, but I think you could modify them and make them more low-impact. Some of the moves also seem to be pretty advanced, but I've also found that I can make a move ""my own"" by modifying it a bit if I'm not quite at Zuzka's level.As with the Cardio Power Series, there is a countdown timer on the screen to keep you motivated, and the rotation calendar is large and of nice quality. The main portion of each workout ranges between 10-15 minutes long.  If you do the warm-up, breakdown, workout, and cool down, it'll bring your workout to about 30 minutes.Unlike the Cardio set, there is some music in the background of each workout, but it's kind of generic electronic music. It's actually pretty quiet, so I think that if you wanted to play your own music in the background, you easily could. The set is also nice-looking, with purple and pink walls.Also, to do these workouts, you'll need a chair and some dumbbells in varying sizes. If you're just starting out, Zuzana recommends using your own body weight up to four-pound dumbbells.  If you're intermediate, she mostly recommends 5-9 pounds, and, if you're advanced, she recommends 10+ pounds. In a few of the workouts, she uses 20-pounders, so you definitely need a range if you want to be challenged.The DVDs arrived along with a workout calendar for the first month.  It is just like the one that came with her Power Cardio series, except that this one focuses on cycling through these 12 workouts.  She has you do the workouts in order, with three days on, one day off, two days on, one day off, and then repeat.As with the first set of DVDs, you are supposed to download the calendars for months 2 and 3 once you finish your first month.  I had been hoping that the included workout calendar would combine the two series, but it doesn't.  Hopefully she'll put some tips for combining them up on her blog or Facebook page, but, in the meantime, I plan on combining one workout from each series each day.The shipping and turnaround on this was also really fast -- much faster than it was for her previous two DVDs.  I ordered my Power Strength Series on Thursday (the first day they were up for sale), and they arrived on Monday.The set also came with a newsletter, which said that Zuzka will be doing the same free online coaching that she did with her first cardio series starting in mid-July.  In the newsletter, she also mentioned that her website is going to be re-designed soon, and that she'll be adding a new workout series called ZShred, which is supposed to launch soon.  (The newsletter doesn't mention if there will be a cost for the series, but does say that ZWows will continue to be offered at her website, too.)Overall, this is another great set that should get awesome results! I plan to start using these workouts this week, and will update my review as I use them more.I hope that this review was helpful, and if you have questions, let me know and I'll do my best to answer them.UPDATE ON 9/6/13: I noticed that these workouts are selling for over $100, so I wanted to mention here that these should only cost about sixteen dollars + four dollars shipping from Watch It Now Entertainment (as sold through Amazon), which is the company that produces and sells all of Zuzana's workouts. The other retailers who are selling this set for exorbitant prices are just taking advantage of consumers.On a different note, someone on a fitness forum I'm active on mentioned that when she moved from doing hour-long workouts to just doing 2-3 ZCut workouts a day (mostly these strength ones), she was able to drop weight and is now, at 52, in the best shape of her life. I've been using these workouts mostly as add-ons to other workouts I do, but that post inspired me to start using my ZCut workouts more!",5,Another knock-out series from Zuzka!,1370217600,"06 3,

1653501,A32VYTEIFO752O,B00D3S7810,"Pheebie ""pheebie""","[19, 19]","I've been doing Zuzka's workouts for 9 weeks now, mostly the Zwow workouts that are available on You Tube.  A couple weeks ago I began using these DVDs and, as expected, they are incredible.  If you're familiar with Zuzka, you'll know what to expect:  high intensity, fast-paced, effective workouts in about 12 - 15 minutes.  Minimal equipment is required (at most you'll need a chair & some dumbbells), and if you're limited on space, that's not a problem either.Since my early 20's, I've been into health & fitness and have just about tried it all (as you can tell by my other reviews on this site.)  When I hit a wall with a routine or DVD, I don't stop working out, I simply find something else that suits me.  Due to the variety offered by Zuzka, both on DVDs and her website, I cannot imagine getting bored with these types of workouts, and they're over too fast to feel like a chore - I love that.I consider myself to be at the intermediate level.  I don't have to pause the DVDs or take breaks, and most of the time I can use the same weight Zuz is using (but not always!)  That being said, these workouts always pack a punch - especially workouts #1 & #12.  When the workout is over, I'm positively drenched in sweat, which may sound disgusting, but I love it.  To me, sweat = accomplishment.  I work out first thing in the morning, and by 5:45 a.m., I'm done and ready to tackle whatever else may come my way.  I feel amazing:  invigorated, invincible . . . . trust me, when you finish a session and you're standing there, face flushed and pink, breathing heavily, your body glazed in perspiration, you'll feel like a bad a**, a glowing, sweaty goddess (who desperately needs a shower).Since beginning Zuz's workouts I can say that, without a doubt, my muscles have become more sculpted and defined, something my husband has nicely mentioned as well. :)  While I didn't need to lose weight, my body composition has changed - I've lost body fat and gained lean muscle mass.  My cardio endurance has also improved.  Every day at work, I take the stairs to my office - 6 flights.  I used to feel myself breathing a little heavier by the 3rd or 4th floor.  Now I SPRINT up that last flight with no problem.  I'll be turning ""the big 4-0"" next year (gasp) and I feel that I am absolutely in the best shape of my life, thanks to Zuz.I'll be purchasing more of her DVDs (I also have the 1st yoga DVD, which I highly recommend even to those who 'don't like yoga'). The production quality, cuing, and menu/chaptering configuration are excellent - far superior to most fitness DVDs I own (and cost considerably more than these, by the way).  I'm also going to sign up for Zgym, since I like real-time, up-to-the-minute workouts and the personalized feel they have.If you're serious about getting in shape, and if you enjoy workouts that get down to business, I suggest you give these a try.  Let's be honest:  who can't spare 15 minutes in the name of health and fitness?  It's SO worth the time and effort.

I understand burpees are a good way to work out your body, but I'd like to have more variety than that.",4,Definitely gets your heart pumping!,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,603,"['12', 'workouts', 'Zuzka', 'are', 'really', 'high', 'intensity', 'seem', 'simple', 'exercises', ""'re"", 'not', 'are', 'pretty', 'short', 'workouts', 'anywhere', '10-15', 'minutes', 'cool-down', '8', 'minutes', 'even', 'one', '10', 'minute', 'workout', 'feel', 'really', 'pumped', ""'m"", 'sweating', 'bullets', 'next', 'day', 'body', 'definitely', 'too', 'only', 'thing', 'workouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'burpees', 'almost', 'workout', 'cardio', 'strength', 'kind', 'annoying', 'understand', 'burpees', 'are', 'good', 'way', 'work', 'out', 'body', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'more', 'variety']",N/A

These focus on strength and they are no nonsense, calorie blasting workouts!  I really appreciate Zuzka's style of moving quickly between exercises.  I have a lot of other workout videos to choose from but always go to Zuzka's to get an intense workout.  There is something to be said about the trainer going through it with you. She struggles along with you and kicks her own butt!  I love it!",5,Amazing!,1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,489,"['videos', 'are', 'amazing', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'addition', 'previous', 'cardio', 'DVD', 'focus', 'strength', 'are', 'nonsense', 'calorie', 'blasting', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Zuzka', 'style', 'moving', 'quickly', 'exercises', 'have', 'lot', 'other', 'workout', 'videos', 'choose', 'always', 'go', 'Zuzka', 'get', 'intense', 'workout', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'trainer', 'going', 'along', 'kicks', 'own', 'butt', 'love']",N/A
