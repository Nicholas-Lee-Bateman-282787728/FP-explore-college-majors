We both had a fabulous time watching these shorts and some hard to find footage as well. Also must mention that the colorization was very impressive and well done!

Snipits of that were interspersed with a lot of black and white footage.  What got me to buy was the picture on the front, which was of their classic golfing short, one of the best they've ever done.  They colorized the picture, making me think that the short would be in the program, but it wasn't.

1039631,A2SNYQC0AVWZZV,B000LP5D6A,"J.T.J., an Author","[3, 3]","I freely admit that I am big-time fan of The Three Stooges. The first time I ever saw them I was six years old, and that was in a theater seeing Larry, Moe and Shemp in a brand new film in 1954! Of course, a few years later I was introduced to Joe Besser in one of their last short subjects. Finally, in 1959 I saw Curly for the first time in the television releases of their classic films of the 1930s and 1940s. Nearly all my life I have enjoyed their comedy.Anyway, I'll get to the point! ""The Three Stooges: Extreme Rarities"" is an amazing collection of tidbits the Stooge fan will enjoy. First, and foremost, we get to see a pretty good reproduction of the wonderful 1948 comedy, ""Heavenly Daze."" That alone is worth the price of the DVD. However, there is a lot more. Stuff about Stooge merchandise, rare TV appearances, and best of all, an incredibly candid interview with Larry Fine after Larry had suffered his stroke. Larry compares Curly and Shemp in the act and manages to praise both brothers Howard while truthfully explaining how well they worked in the act. Clearly, Larry respected Shemp's talent, but most definitely felt in awe of Curly's genius. He is not exactly disrespectful of Moe, but one gets the feeling there had been something of a rocky relationship between them over the years. Seeing and hearing Larry talk about these and other topics was wonderful. I only wish there was more than one interview. It is a shame that we don't have interviews with Curly or Shemp. To the best of my knowledge, I don't think any filmed interviews with those great comics have turned up over these many decades.Anyway, several other reviewers went into better detail than I have about the many delightful features on this DVD. I simply wanted to emphasize that it is truly worth it to get ""Heavenly Daze"" and the Larry Fine interview. Keep in mind there is much more on the disc. The DVD is well worth the price! I urge fans of ""The Six Stooges"" to purchase this entertaining and informative offering.",4,"Hey, Moe; it's a Bonanza!",1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,2013,"['freely', 'admit', 'am', 'big-time', 'fan', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'theater', 'seeing', 'Larry', 'Moe', 'Shemp', 'brand', 'new', 'film', '1954', 'course', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'introduced', 'Joe', 'Besser', 'one', 'last', 'short', 'subjects', 'Finally', '1959', 'saw', 'Curly', 'first', 'time', 'television', 'releases', 'classic', 'films', '1930s', '1940s', 'Nearly', 'life', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'comedy.Anyway', ""'ll"", 'get', 'point', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Extreme', 'Rarities', 'amazing', 'collection', 'tidbits', 'Stooge', 'fan', 'will', 'enjoy', 'First', 'foremost', 'get', 'see', 'pretty', 'good', 'reproduction', 'wonderful', '1948', 'comedy', 'Heavenly', 'Daze', 'alone', 'price', 'DVD', 'However', 'lot', 'more', 'Stuff', 'Stooge', 'merchandise', 'rare', 'TV', 'appearances', 'best', 'incredibly', 'candid', 'interview', 'Larry', 'Fine', 'Larry', 'had', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'Shemp', 'act', 'manages', 'praise', 'brothers', 'Howard', 'truthfully', 'explaining', 'how', 'well', 'worked', 'act', 'Clearly', 'Larry', 'respected', 'Shemp', 'talent', 'most', 'definitely', 'felt', 'awe', 'Curly', 'genius', 'not', 'exactly', 'disrespectful', 'Moe', 'one', 'feeling', 'had', 'been', 'something', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'years', 'Seeing', 'hearing', 'Larry', 'talk', 'other', 'topics', 'was', 'wonderful', 'only', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'interview', 'shame', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'interviews', 'Curly', 'Shemp', 'best', 'knowledge', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'filmed', 'interviews', 'great', 'comics', 'have', 'turned', 'up', 'many', 'decades.Anyway', 'several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'went', 'better', 'detail', 'have', 'many', 'delightful', 'features', 'DVD', 'simply', 'wanted', 'emphasize', 'truly', 'worth', 'get', 'Heavenly', 'Daze', 'Larry', 'Fine', 'interview', 'Keep', 'mind', 'much', 'more', 'disc', 'DVD', 'well', 'price', 'urge', 'fans', 'Six', 'Stooges', 'purchase', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'offering']",The Three Stooges: Extreme Rarities

1039638,AYPJ6NY77MTYP,B000LP5D6A,Teresa Anson,"[9, 15]","One of the problems with loving the products of a bygone era is that the ""bygone era"" part so often becomes a limiting factor in your experience.  What I mean by this is that, particularly given early incarnations of media, time often destroys or degrades the material that we do have, leaving us with an unsatisfying and incomplete lexicon to enjoy.  Consider the Roman philosophers: we consider them great today, and that's with our possessing only a small fraction of their works.  Imagine what we'd think of them if we had a complete image.So too it is with the Three Stooges, true-blue American philosophers whose extant performances are an incomplete picture of their greatness, until now.  The Three Stooges: Extreme Rarities is exactly as it sounds--a compilation of unique and interesting Stooge material that you've never seen before; ranging from shorts, to stage performances, to pilot episodes, to interviews, to classic commercials, etc...  As the marketing literature says, this is truly a must-own for any fan of the knuckleheads.Did I neglect to mention that all of this is in full-color?
