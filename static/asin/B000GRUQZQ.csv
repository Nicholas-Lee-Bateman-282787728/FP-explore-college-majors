1006666,AQUU8S55JGY2H,B000GRUQZQ,Aco,"[1, 2]","I am a Mamet lover. I thought Edmond was a terrific read as a play, and would be very interested in seeing it performed on stage. I was pleasantly surprised after watching this Edmond, that it retained the swiftness and grit of his paradoxical spiraling-into-the-depths-of-depravity/transcending-of-himself-in-the-world.Without a doubt William H. Macy, who for anyone who doesn't know this, is along with castmates Joe Mantegna and Rebecca Pidgeon (Mamet's wife), an expert in playing Mamet. His presence as Edmond Burke gives the film as much cache as the fact Mamet wrote the screenplay. His scene with Mantegna early on is one of the best too.As for my pleasant surprise I am reminded that I have been disappointed by some of Mamet's original films (Heist, Spartan and State & Main were all overstuffed, not lean enough, with too many twists and turns) but have enjoyed the adaptations of his plays (Lakeboat, American Buffalo, Glengarry Glen Ross). This maybe due to the unity of his spare style and the limitations of space a play, even one adapted to screen, must exist within.This film's use of recognizable faces in single scenes was perhaps a consequence of Mamet's respect in the industry, and maybe an attempt at marketing a sordid and deep story beyond any expected attention. All performers get the chance to needle Macy's Edmond, with the acceptable duplicity of routine interactions, propelling him deeper into the ecstacy of ridding himself of himself. The brilliance of the story is that he must become everything he never wanted to (john, racist, murderer, homosexual) in order to be where he belongs. Constantly being lied to has rendered him inert, thus a double time dose of truth or passion or rage or unconsciousness must be his salvation. That's what Mamet is able to create and convey, the ancient philosophical paradox of achieving bliss or something like it, by destroying the existence one has spent so much energy creating, here amidst the dark places of our modern world (bars, tarot readers, strip joints, back alleys, dingy apartments, prisons, subways....remember, he never does enter the church)....",4,"Edmond Burke, WM47",1181779200,"06 14, 2007",2007,2133,"['am', 'Mamet', 'lover', 'thought', 'Edmond', 'was', 'terrific', 'read', 'play', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'interested', 'seeing', 'performed', 'stage', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'watching', 'Edmond', 'retained', 'swiftness', 'grit', 'paradoxical', 'spiraling-into-the-depths-of-depravity/transcending-of-himself-in-the-world.Without', 'doubt', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'who', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'castmates', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'Rebecca', 'Pidgeon', 'Mamet', 'wife', 'expert', 'playing', 'Mamet', 'presence', 'Edmond', 'Burke', 'film', 'much', 'cache', 'fact', 'Mamet', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'scene', 'Mantegna', 'early', 'one', 'best', 'too.As', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'am', 'reminded', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Mamet', 'original', 'films', 'Heist', 'Spartan', 'State', 'Main', 'were', 'overstuffed', 'not', 'lean', 'enough', 'too', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'adaptations', 'plays', 'Lakeboat', 'American', 'Buffalo', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'maybe', 'due', 'unity', 'spare', 'style', 'limitations', 'space', 'play', 'even', 'one', 'adapted', 'screen', 'must', 'exist', 'within.This', 'film', 'use', 'recognizable', 'single', 'scenes', 'was', 'perhaps', 'consequence', 'Mamet', 'respect', 'industry', 'maybe', 'attempt', 'marketing', 'sordid', 'deep', 'story', 'expected', 'attention', 'performers', 'get', 'chance', 'needle', 'Macy', 'Edmond', 'acceptable', 'duplicity', 'routine', 'interactions', 'propelling', 'deeper', 'ecstacy', 'ridding', 'brilliance', 'story', 'must', 'become', 'everything', 'never', 'wanted', 'john', 'racist', 'murderer', 'homosexual', 'order', 'be', 'where', 'Constantly', 'being', 'lied', 'rendered', 'inert', 'thus', 'double', 'time', 'dose', 'truth', 'passion', 'rage', 'unconsciousness', 'must', 'be', 'salvation', 'what', 'Mamet', 'able', 'create', 'convey', 'ancient', 'philosophical', 'paradox', 'achieving', 'bliss', 'something', 'destroying', 'existence', 'one', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'creating', 'here', 'dark', 'places', 'modern', 'world', 'bars', 'tarot', 'readers', 'strip', 'joints', 'back', 'alleys', 'dingy', 'apartments', 'prisons', 'subways', '.remember', 'never', 'enter', 'church']",Edmond
1006667,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000GRUQZQ,A Customer,"[29, 33]","Perhaps the real title of David Mamet's incendiary Edmond should perhaps be, careful what you wish for, or even don't vilify certain minority groups because your actions may come back to haunt you. This edgy and provocative film, featuring a truly spectacular performance by William H. Macy, features the cerebral Mamet at his dramatic best.Here we have the angst-ridden, misogynistic, racist and homophobic male, so pent-up with hidden fury that he's becomes a walking nightmare. He's a bomb waiting to burst as all the years of ""being on top"" gradually deflate as he trolls through a nighttime labyrinth of crime-ridden streets, alleyways, and strip clubs in New York, just waiting to explode. (Interestingly the movie was actually filmed in Downtown Los Angeles).Edmond Burke (Macy) is deeply frustrated with is life and work. Tired of being a white-collar robot, he abruptly tells his wife (Rebecca Pidgeon) that he is going to walk out on their marriage because she no longer interests him sexually or spiritually. He's just been to a tarot card reading and the results are not good - murder, blood, mayhem and prison dominate with the dumbfounded psychic telling him, ""You are not where you belong.""In a local bar he meets a fellow white-collar worker (Joe Mantegna) directs Edmond to a gentleman's club where he convinces him that what he probably needs is some sex. And in this scene we get the first glimpse of a man who is living on the edge and is easily swayed.He visits a strip club, a peep show and a massage parlor, where he visits a variety of gorgeous girls including Denise Richards and Mena Suvari, but he's too tight-fisted to part with any money and leaves in a huff or is physically ousted. Back on the street he's preyed on by African-Americans and then arms himself and lashes out, but violence brings him no peace.He ends up at the apartment of a kindly waitress (Julia Stiles) where wielding a knife, he unleashes a rant, a foul-mouthed tirade against certain minority groups. She freaks out and he resorts to an action where the damage to his life is irreparably done. Edmond's final odyssey finally takes him from the city to a penitentiary where his prejudices come back to haunt him and where he is forced to face all that drove him into his crazy delusions.Originally written for the stage in 1982, some of the issues may seem a bit dated by today's standards. The idea of pinstriped respectability meeting the - mostly black - urban nihilistic jungle might come across as a bit perfunctory, and even a bit clich&eacute;d. Still, the story with its incendiary language and its merciless portrait of a 47-year-old fractured man who embraces his own worst nightmares of racial and sexual suppression is still totally compelling.Indeed Edmond is a must-see for fans of Bill Macy, who is truly a master at playing this walking time bomb in mild-mannered camouflage. With his ears sticking out from his washed out, blood drained face, he is indeed truly scary. Edmond might be depressing and provocative and even disgusting, but it's also gritty and honest and worth watching for experiencing one of America's best known serious playwrights working in all his unadulterated and uncensored grandeur.

People expect you to be able to recreate magic anytime you step up to the plate (how's that for mixing metaphors?).  I saw this DVD on the shelf at Blockbuster, and when I saw it was from the person that wrote one of my favorite movies (Glengarry GlenRoss), and starred one of my favorite actors William Macy, I couldn't get to the checkout counter quick enough.Where Glengarry GlenRoss was one of the best written, best acted films with the most diverse and accomplished ensemble cast ever to be contained in a single title, Edmund was mostly a one man show where the people that that character encountered where used almost as props for his dialog and actions.  Macy is great (as always), but I never felt the empathy for him that I did for Jack Lemmon's down on his luck Shelly ""the machine"" Levene in Glen'.  I never felt hatred for any of the others on the screen like I did for Kevin Spacey's office boss character.  I really couldn't care less for any of the people in the movie.There was one scene early in the film that had a familiar feel with Glen', where Macy was drinking and chatting with a stranger in a bar after having just walked out on his wife.  This was classic Mamet back-and-forth, and was right up there with Pachino's Ricky Roma working his mark to get him to sign on the line in Glen'. I was feeling good about the film at that point, but that encounter passed and it lost the Mamet vibe for me for the rest of the movie.This was not a bad film, but I expected more based on the pedigree.  Like I said, having a track record can be a good thing, or it can remind the viewer how far you might be from your peak.  When I wish to introduce the uninitiated to Mamet (and terrific acting), I'll pull out my copy of Glen' and show how well the written word can be rendered on-film.",3,"It might be Mamet, but it isn't Glengarry GlenRoss",1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,1849,"['problem', 'having', 'track', 'record', 'People', 'expect', 'be', 'able', 'recreate', 'magic', 'anytime', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'how', 'mixing', 'metaphors', 'saw', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'Blockbuster', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'person', 'wrote', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Glengarry', 'GlenRoss', 'starred', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'William', 'Macy', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'checkout', 'counter', 'quick', 'enough.Where', 'Glengarry', 'GlenRoss', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'best', 'acted', 'films', 'most', 'diverse', 'accomplished', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'ever', 'be', 'contained', 'single', 'title', 'Edmund', 'was', 'mostly', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'where', 'people', 'character', 'encountered', 'where', 'used', 'almost', 'props', 'dialog', 'actions', 'Macy', 'great', 'always', 'never', 'felt', 'empathy', 'did', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'down', 'luck', 'Shelly', 'machine', 'Levene', 'Glen', 'never', 'felt', 'hatred', 'others', 'screen', 'did', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'office', 'boss', 'character', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'people', 'movie.There', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'early', 'film', 'had', 'familiar', 'feel', 'Glen', 'where', 'Macy', 'was', 'drinking', 'chatting', 'stranger', 'bar', 'having', 'just', 'walked', 'out', 'wife', 'was', 'classic', 'Mamet', 'back-and-forth', 'was', 'right', 'there', 'Pachino', 'Ricky', 'Roma', 'working', 'mark', 'get', 'sign', 'line', 'Glen', 'was', 'feeling', 'good', 'film', 'point', 'encounter', 'passed', 'lost', 'Mamet', 'vibe', 'rest', 'movie.This', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'expected', 'more', 'based', 'pedigree', 'said', 'having', 'track', 'record', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'remind', 'viewer', 'how', 'far', 'might', 'be', 'peak', 'When', 'wish', 'introduce', 'uninitiated', 'Mamet', 'terrific', 'acting', ""'ll"", 'pull', 'out', 'copy', 'Glen', 'show', 'how', 'well', 'written', 'word', 'can', 'be', 'rendered', 'on-film']",Edmond

1006672,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000GRUQZQ,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 3]","Most fans of William H. Macy will love him in the role of Edmond Burke, and his character portrayal certainly has its merits. With those puppy-dog eyes, many will feel a touch of empathy for a mostly unempathetic character in EDMOND, a film from horror master Stuart Gordon (director of RE-ANIMATOR and the newer KING OF THE ANTS).Macy isn't unfamiliar with the dark side of cinema. His role as the sexually inadequate Little Bill in BOOGIE NIGHTS cemented his acting career. But he's moved on to ""brighter"" pastures with the warm-and-fuzzy PLEASANTVILLE and his stunningly excellent Sheriff Chappy in HAPPY TEXAS. That Macy reinvests himself on the shadowy side won't bother anyone, but Edmond's script surely will.Where the film fails is in its beginnings. Edmond Burke seems like a regular Joe leaving work when he's handed a Post-It note with a change in time for an appointment tomorrow. On it is scrolled the time of 1:15. He heads home and has a confusing argument with his wife (Rebecca Pidgeon, SHOPGIRL). He explains that he's emotionally and sexually unattracted to her and then promptly leaves. This is where the film has its biggest problem. We're never privy to Edmond's previous life experiences and so don't know why he feels this way. There appears to be no motivation for his leaving. He just ...does, and we're supposed to, somehow, understand it. And this lost understanding will plague the rest of the film for viewers.Edmond heads out into the night and comes upon a fortune teller who tells him ""You're not where you should be."" The rest of the film is relegated to finding out ""where"" he's supposed to be and constantly running into the 1:15 reference, a personal omen. What he finds is an unleashing of pent up sexual desire, anger, bigotry and murder. Edmond has had some sort of psychotic break but, again, the audience wasn't privy to his life before this night so have no gauge to tell why this has happened. He's just ""going crazy"" and the audience is supposed to go along with it. The 1:15 omen pops up at dangerous intersections, as do visions of the fortune teller's tarot cards, sinking Edmond deeper and deeper into a pit of no return.Scripting problems aside, there's no damning comments to made about Macy's performance.

1006677,A17IDP37NM8TFJ,B000GRUQZQ,Eugene Chamson,"[5, 7]","Seeing this film in the video rental store, I had high expectations.  A David Mamet ""sexy thriller"" starring William H. Macy; what could be bad?  Unfortunately, the film is neither sexy nor thrilling, and does not rise to the level of Mamet's other works.  But it does succeed in being both interesting and disturbing.Macy gives a frenzied performance as Edmond, a middle-aged white professional who descends into madness as his life careens out of control.  We witness Edmond as he reacts against all the horrible things he sees in the world:  greed, lawlessness, cruelty, violence, loneliness, and ultimately the emptiness and meaninglessness of his life.  It's reminiscent of DeNiro in  ""Taxi Driver"" and Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down"", both of which are better films.The problem with ""Edmond"" is that we don't connect with or care enough about the main character.  We don't feel his pain, and so we can't understand his actions.  There are some satisfying scenes where Edmond righteously defends against the prostitutes, muggers and other lowlifes in his path.  But just as we start to feel we understand him, Edmond lashes out violently against seemingly innocent victims.  It's as if the filmmakers couldn't decide between making a thoughtful drama or a slasher horror flick, and so combined elements of both.There are flashes of Mamet's trademark sparse snappy dialog which are almost poetic.  But whenever Edmond tries to say something meaningful about his philosophy, it just comes across as the rantings of a psychopath.  This is a serious weakness of the film.  You can't have the main character acting crazy and then expect us to take anything he says seriously.Overall, the film has a nightmarish quality to it that is captivating.  All the action takes place at night at seedy locales.  And while any given scene unfolds in a logical manner, taken as a whole, the plot makes no sense.  LIke most nightmares, we get caught up as the story unfolds, shocking and unnerving us.  I suppose Edmond's living nightmare brings consciousness to some dark areas of our psyches that are disturbing to see.

Macy has ever done.  In a bravura performance he embodies the strange creature created by David Mamet, triumphs in the extended monologues that include hate, racism, homophobia, hopelessness, and fear and serves them up in a near stoic way that allows the viewer to accompany the dissociating man into the depths of hell - but with an absolutely solid ending.  It may not be an easy movie to watch, but it is clearly one actor's tour de force that deserves attention.Edmond (Macy) is a bored, frustrated. angry robot of a worker who happens on a fortune teller who reads his Tarot cards and tells him he is in the wrong place. Edmond, obviously disturbed, goes home, leaves his wife who no longer stimulates him spiritually or sensuously, and begins his Rake's Progress journey through the bowels of the filthy city.  He has a bar conversation with an anonymous guy (Joe Montegna) who advises him to go get laid, gives him an address, and disappears.  What follows is a series of bad encounters with hookers, peep show dancers, sidewalk con artists, and pimps: Edmond spits out vitriolic racist epithets, is beaten and robbed, pawns his ring, buys a vicious knife, and begins his retribution - a path that includes murder and prison.  As he ultimately finds his prison cell the only place of rest he can tolerate, in comes a cellmate (African American of course) and after an abusive start, Edmond shaves his head, gets tattooed and the story closes in a rather tender fashion.The cast is superb: the vignettes of the characters Edmond encounters include Mena Suvari, Julia Stiles, Bokeem Woodbine, Rebecca Pidgeon, along with other less well known but equally fine actors.  Stuart Gordon directs Mamet's play-to-film story with the right amount of bluntness and dark, smarmy street situations.  But it is Macy who is uncanny in his ability to carry us along the warped and disintegrating mind of the character who could be any of a number standing next to us in an elevator....A tough film but well worth viewing.

Most of the sexiness is Macy just walking around a red light district looking at posters and ads.  Also by about the midway point, maybe even earlier, the film turns on it's head a bit and obviously sexiness or even blatant sex has little to do with it.  Also why in the world is a gun on the front cover???  Unless I missed something that gun or any gun really was never part of any scene in the entire movie.Over all the story is interesting if not a little flimsy and lacking some depth beyond the middle aged man losing his grip angel.  Some of the dialogue has some unique plot but mostly the film is Macy walking around telling people they are charging him too much money.  After a while it is obvious he has lost his mind a bit but the director really slams it home so by films end you will be tired of his psychotic ramblings.  There was some humor involved and I did enjoy that.Overall I think I would have enjoyed this film more had the marketing been accurate.

The movie was adapted by Mamet from his own play and evokes (to me) memories of filmslike ""Buffalo 66"" and ""Breakfast on Pluto."" Not necessarily in their style or in the storyline; But both films follow a character around through a slew of (mis)adventures. Edmond"" is simalar to that. We basically walk in on a mans life and watch it unfold. There's little character development, no reasoning for his actions, and no apologies. The movie was one of the quietest releases of this year. Few people have heard of the film and most people won't like the film. Too bad since it's one of the best (and strangest) films I've seen this year. First off, I knew nothing of this movie before watching it. It's definitely a little bit bizarre. William H. Macy, in one of his strongest performances, plays Edmond. After going to a Tarot card reader (who shows him unpleasant looking cards, but never explains them), he blatantly and unapologetically leaves his wife. The scene unfolds quickly and seems to end before it should. He comes home, tell her he's leaving her almost in the middle of a conversation; She yells at him and he leaves. Edmond ends up at a bar where he has an abnormal philosophical conversation with a man (Joe Mantegna), who gives him $100 dollars and tells him to get laid. Edmond goes to a club, where he unsuccessfully tries to do so with a girl (Denise Richards). Next he goes to a peep show, where once again he leaves...Empty handed. He tries a massage parlor, where he's turned down by yet another girl (Mena Suvari) because he doesn't have enough money. Then he's ripped off by a couple of three card monty players, but finds his own kind of redemption after he beats up a pimp. It's obvious, but is left unsaid, through most of the film that Edmond has a screw loose and by the end of the film he's in prison. He accomplishes quite a bit in 82 minutes. Besides a fight/murder scene, the movie is fueled by conversations. It is based on a play and most of the conversations are so philosophical and out-there, that most viewers will wonder to themselves ""What the f**k is the point?"" Truth be told, there is no point. But if you like movies like ""Buffalo 66"" then you might like this movie. It's subtle, low-key, and kind of weird...But it's really good.

Even in the most stretched understanding of the word.This movie is part character study, part drama and part exemplifying a theory. The theory that we are a product of our environment. Mamet cleverly wove that theory in and among others. Such as the debate over whether our life is choice or destiny. The direction he took here was that the main character made a choice... and found his destiny as a result of that choice. And his choice led him into an environment that molded him into what others wanted him to be.This is the story of a man who let's his grip on his reality go and slips into another reality completely foreign to him. Feeling dejected and lonely, Edmond seeks advice from a fortune teller. Of course, the fortune tellers' words confirms how he feels about his life... that he's not where he belongs.Edmond then leaves his wife and life and grabs onto the sharp metal rails of the staircase leading to the underbelly of society with greased and naive hands. What follows is a succession of events that lead him to 'where he does belong'.Not wanting to give much away here, but Macy's character, Edmond, is stilted and opinionated to say the least. He feels... therefore he is. And with each turn of events his thoughts and feelings lead him further from his former self. He questions everything and yet finds no answers.There are numerous theories of society, group behavior, theology, religion and development that Edmond scratches the surface of only to become the product of his environment. The environment he chose.The reason I chose 4 stars is for the horribly wrong billing that this movie, as well as others, has recieved from hollywood.

1006689,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B000GRUQZQ,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[10, 14]","It's not hard to say that William Macy's an actor's actor--which means that he can take on virtually any role and do absolute wonders with it. In ""Edmond"" he's the title character who, at the beginning, walks out on his beautiful, sexy wife (Rebecca Pidgeon), which immediately sets the viewer's mind on edge. It's not only that she's so attractive; it's also the way he phrases his disillusion with her that makes you cringe.From there things go progressively downhill. We start with Edmond's frustration in his marriage and subsequently understand his lust--which apparently was not being satisfied by his beautiful wife--and, ultimately, his rage. It's rage, in fact, that fuels Edmond throughout the course of the film, through his encounters with three different hookers, a woman on a subway, a waitress, and a pimp on the street. Early on, his rage is also fueled by a man in a bar Edmond goes to; the man is played by Joe Mantegna, who spouts racism and sexism as fluidly and easily as anyone might talk about the weather. And Edmond immediately agrees with everything the man says--not because, as we understand, he really is necessarily racist or sexist, but because he is more than anything else a truly angry person.Rage makes Edmond lie and kill, and drives him to attempts at lustful encounters with the hookers, all of which end in frustration and non-fulfillment. In this short (under 80 minutes) film, Macy gives a knockout performance as Edmond. This is a one-man show definitely worth seeing.The ending is a bitterly ironic conclusion to a highly troubled journey that ultimately leaves the viewer either sad or pondering...or perhaps both.Highly recommended.",4,"Stinging drama of frustration, lust, and rage",1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,1677,"['not', 'hard', 'say', 'William', 'Macy', 'actor', 'actor', 'can', 'take', 'virtually', 'role', 'do', 'absolute', 'wonders', 'Edmond', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'beginning', 'out', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'wife', 'Rebecca', 'Pidgeon', 'immediately', 'viewer', 'mind', 'edge', 'not', 'only', 'so', 'attractive', 'also', 'way', 'disillusion', 'cringe.From', 'things', 'go', 'progressively', 'downhill', 'start', 'Edmond', 'frustration', 'marriage', 'subsequently', 'understand', 'lust', 'apparently', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'satisfied', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'ultimately', 'rage', 'rage', 'fact', 'fuels', 'Edmond', 'course', 'film', 'encounters', 'three', 'different', 'hookers', 'woman', 'subway', 'waitress', 'pimp', 'street', 'Early', 'rage', 'also', 'fueled', 'man', 'bar', 'Edmond', 'man', 'played', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'who', 'racism', 'sexism', 'fluidly', 'easily', 'anyone', 'might', 'talk', 'weather', 'Edmond', 'immediately', 'everything', 'man', 'not', 'because', 'understand', 'really', 'necessarily', 'racist', 'sexist', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'truly', 'angry', 'person.Rage', 'Edmond', 'lie', 'kill', 'attempts', 'lustful', 'encounters', 'hookers', 'end', 'frustration', 'non-fulfillment', 'short', '80', 'minutes', 'film', 'Macy', 'knockout', 'performance', 'Edmond', 'one-man', 'show', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing.The', 'ending', 'bitterly', 'ironic', 'conclusion', 'highly', 'troubled', 'journey', 'ultimately', 'viewer', 'sad', 'pondering', 'perhaps', 'both.Highly', 'recommended']",Edmond
1006690,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000GRUQZQ,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 5]","One of my favorite actors is William H. Macy.  I also like the work of playwright and screenwriter David Mamet.  Put these elements together, and I knew I had to see it, even though this 2005 film was panned by the critics and never really made it big in the theaters.  Well, what is sourly overlooked by some is like sweet honey to others. And in this case, I'm one of those ""others"".  From the very beginning, I was completely entranced.  And then I was sorry when it was over.The film is based on a play written in the early eighties.  So it seems a little dated.  But that didn't matter to me.The film opens as William H. Macy, wearing a suit and tie and leaving his office, has a yearning to do something different.  He stops in at a fortune tell who tells him that this is not where he's supposed to be.  And so he goes home, tells his wife he is leaving her, and just walks away from his middle class humdrum life.  Naturally the first place he goes is a bar where he meets another man in a suit who sympathizes with him in a long monologue.  Yes, there are lots of long monologues in this film, most of which are spoken by Macy.  And the words of these monologues are a combination of frustration, pearls of wisdom and pure poetry.Macy is looking for an amorous adventure and so we follow him through a wide variety of sleazy clip joints and houses of ill repute.  Often, he gets angry at the price and argues with the girls.  Always, there is a rage inside of him that is ready to explode.  We sense that.  But we don't realize how unpredictable this streak is.  We witness his character changing.  We see him growing violent.  First he beats up a pimp.  And then, inevitably he's drawn in to an even more violent act - one that horrified me because I didn't quite think it would get quite this bad.  The ending is very satisfying and fits right in to the rest of the film.As far as Macy's acting goes, he does a super fantastic job.  He seems to ""own"" the role.  I can't think of any other actor who would do it as well.I loved this film.  And recommend it highly, especially if you're not afraid of a lot of realistic violence.",5,"William H.

1006692,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000GRUQZQ,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[8, 12]","I love me some Mamet.  His dialogue takes some getting used to, since it is crafted so as to touch on the edges of realism while inhabiting a more stylistic realm.  I also love his dedication to his actors, employing the same ones over and over, so that his movies come off as different shows performed by the same theatrical troupe, which may very well be his point.However, Edmond is the first Mamet film to leave me disappointed and, worse, annoyed.Macy plays Edmond with typical wide-eyed aplomb.  Edmond is a man who is weak, but is valiantly (if not clumsily) trying to be strong.  The movie starts with a chance encounter with a fortune teller whose tarot card reading provides a cinematic outline for the remainder of the film.  Edmond then goes home, breaks up with his wife, and goes on a deaf, dumb, and blind search for himself, finding instead over-priced whores, pimps who are not-what-they-seem, and -- generally -- everything but himself.I get the point: Edmond is the epitome of modern man's emasculation, unable to find his own balls with both hands, and his tawdry and panicked search through New York for some unnameable salvation is an example of the lengths anyone must go (man or woman) to find, if not redemption, then the places where one ""belongs.""There are a lot of problems here.  Most superficially, there's one of packaging.  The DVD box prominently features a picture of a gun, and no gun appears in the film.  The tags on the box call the film, alternately, a mystery and a fast-paced thriller, when it is neither one of those things.  Not even close.  This movie is (like most of Mamet's work) based on a play; never before has it been more obvious (unless you count the absolutely brilliant Oleanna).Edmond is, essentially, a one-man show, with Macy delivering numbing and rambling monologues, stopped only occasionally to engage in awkward and almost meaningless side action with ancillary characters (some of them played well -- Denise Richards actually shines in her brief scene as a hooker -- and some of them not so well -- Julia Stiles seems over-medicated in her role as an ambivalent and easily persuaded waitress).  In spite of how they do and don't help Edmond make his way through the tunnel of decadence and misery he creates for himself, most of these characters seem disposable, making the movie come across as equally dismissable.  (I would also like to take a moment here to make a small observation about Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, an actress who appears, I think, in every single one of her husband's films: this woman is, viewed in even the nicest of lights, one of the worst actresses I've ever seen, and she sucks the life out of every scene she's in.  In this movie she plays Edmond's wife, and does so with heartless and uninspired vehemence.  It's nice that Mamet gives his wife the opportunities he does, but one has to wonder if she'd ever get any acting work at all if she weren't married to such a famous writer/director).At the risk of spoiling the film, I will say that, at the end, Edmond finally does find where he ""belongs,"" a place that, given his previous struggles, makes a lot of sense (although the manner in which he finds this belonging might offend more than a few viewers).  But this is small consolation since, by this time, few people are likely to have any sympathy for Edmond or where he ends up.  His character's slap-dash personality combined with the persistent and mostly meaningless monologues on fate, fear, destiny and (ironically) meaning make for a benumbing and distasteful cinematic experience.

Strip clubs, peep shows and prostitution. But lust never seems to satisfy at any price.Repressed rage must find an outlet, as it always will.

Quick dialogs and brief encounters lead us to a dramatic change in a life of a middle aged dilusional man. Edmond is 47 year old professional who suddenly realizes that he is bored with his life, his wife and work. On a whim, he decides to leave it all and pursue a search for higher self. The women who could give him excitement he is looking for, are all for hire (ladies of the night) and apparently - according to Edmond - they cost too much. Which tells us that Edmond was either married for too long, or ""born yesterday"". In the course of one night, Edmond's life changes completely. In the end, he is in place and time where he manages to: have time to meditate on purpose of (his) life, get over his prejudices (racial and otherwise) and finally break away from the boredom what was haunting him thru the last several years of his marriage.

Both charactors treat their marriage as though it had no meaning and the scene plays like a break up of an informal boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. It's a ridulously phony scene. Then, Macy roams the streets looking to get laid from various prostitutes and he cannot consumate the ""deal"" because he is too nerdy, too anxiety prone, too upitty.Then, out of nowhere, his charactor takes a violent/evil turn which is also where the movie takes it's own turn in the ""wrong"" direction.The bulk of the movie takes place over just one evening (a la Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"") emitting out of a theme  that ""the 0grass isn't necessarily greener on the other side"". When the movie addresses Macy not assimilating into the world, the film is interesting. However, once the movie goes into another violent direction ( I don't want to spoil the plot), is when the movie becomes unbelievable and foolishly brutal.Macy is a small man so when his character turns menacing, it is simply not believable. I am usually a fan of Mamet's gritty dialogue yet, in this movie, his usual colloquialisms are too contrived. Many of the converstations are too peppered with obsenities and are not reflective of true life. Macy blurts out ""For Christ's sake"" way too many timesThe pacing of the movie is strange. For the bulk, it's supposed to be a long, bad evening but then it covers a much longer time span with no form of narrative to explain why and what is happening, the movie loses whatever rythm it tried to create.The movie is extremely misogynistic (I'm a man) and the women in Mamet's universe have no role other than to be whores, scam artists, strippers, weak-minded or feeble. There is a murder of a woman in this movie where there is no addressing of the tragedy of the crime.

Edmond is an effective vehicle for this kind of deep psychological probing and it brings out the best in mamet and in macy... It is not the movie you think it is.. it is something quite different and quite daring..While stylistically it isn't so shocking per se.. its themes are very interesting and twisted..a must see.,4,the irony of a man's passions,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,675,"['what', 'like', 'edmond', 'very', 'true', 'life..', 'so', 'often', 'people', 'who', 'behave', 'outragous', 'ways', 'have', 'most', 'hatred', 'towards', 'other', 'people..', 'so', 'often', 'very', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'supress', 'true', 'desires', 'true', 'feelings..', 'break', 'down', 'walls', 'barriers', 'what', 'not', 'can', 'see', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'core..', 'Edmond', 'effective', 'vehicle', 'kind', 'deep', 'psychological', 'probing', 'out', 'best', 'mamet', 'macy', 'not', 'movie', 'think', 'something', 'quite', 'different', 'quite', 'daring..While', 'stylistically', ""n't"", 'so', 'shocking', 'se..', 'themes', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'twisted..a', 'must', 'see']",Edmond

I had to hear about this film from my dad!  How do you like them apples?  Though I certainly wouldn't call this film artsy, it's one of those that you can take from it what you want, and different people seem to have different interpretations of it's meaning.  When you see a guy on the street or in a subway ranting and raving and acting like a loon, you wonder who is that guy and what's his story?  What happened to him to make him like this, etc?  I tend to view this movie as a kind of backstory to one of these characters, but that's probably not the intent, nor what other people think of when they watch this.  The film is a bit like After Hours in the sense that it deals with a guy who's pretty much lost in his own city over the course of one night while terrible things happen all around him.  But, in this film, Macy seems to be the cause of all the misery as opposed to being on the receiving end.  The film basically shows Macy, who's gone off the deep end from the start, gradually going more insane as the night progresses, resulting in some horrific stuff.  Macy's an actor I've always liked, but never really payed too much attention to.  He was just always kinda ""there"" for me, but in this movie he really gets your attention and comes off as a very convincing, sad and dangerous man on the edge.  The film was originally performed as a stage play written by David Mamet, and it shows.  The film does play out as though it were a play, which will turn some folks off, calling it ""boring"" or ""pointless"".  Alot of reviewers here keep bringing up Mamet, Mamet, Mamet.  Very few reviewers bring up the fact that Stuart Gordon directed this movie, and fewer still acknowledge his contribution.  Sure, the screenplay and dialog is all Mamet without a doubt.  This is indeed a Stuart Gordon movie though.  His presence is just as evident as Mamet's.  It may not be one of his horror films, but fans will be able to identify the style.  He seems to be one of the few directors who can make films outside his usual genre and still maintain the same ""feel""(King Of The Ants was another great example).  Sure, it is a bit more cerebral than most of Gordon's previous work, but that's most likely the Mamet influence.  Definitely worth a look for fans of Gordon, Mamet and William H Macy.",4,Another Great Non Horror Gordon Film,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,2398,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Stuart', 'Gordon', 'film', 'somehow', 'slipped', 'radar', 'had', 'hear', 'film', 'dad', 'How', 'do', 'apples', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'film', 'artsy', 'one', 'can', 'take', 'what', 'want', 'different', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'different', 'interpretations', 'meaning', 'When', 'see', 'guy', 'street', 'subway', 'ranting', 'raving', 'acting', 'loon', 'wonder', 'who', 'guy', 'what', 'story', 'What', 'happened', 'make', 'etc', 'tend', 'view', 'movie', 'kind', 'backstory', 'one', 'characters', 'probably', 'not', 'intent', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'think', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'bit', 'Hours', 'sense', 'guy', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'lost', 'own', 'city', 'course', 'one', 'night', 'terrible', 'things', 'happen', 'film', 'Macy', 'be', 'cause', 'misery', 'opposed', 'being', 'receiving', 'end', 'film', 'basically', 'Macy', 'who', 'gone', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'start', 'gradually', 'going', 'more', 'insane', 'night', 'resulting', 'horrific', 'stuff', 'Macy', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'never', 'really', 'payed', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'was', 'just', 'always', 'kinda', 'movie', 'really', 'attention', 'off', 'very', 'convincing', 'sad', 'dangerous', 'man', 'edge', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'performed', 'stage', 'play', 'written', 'David', 'Mamet', 'film', 'play', 'out', 'were', 'play', 'will', 'turn', 'folks', 'calling', 'boring', 'pointless', 'Alot', 'reviewers', 'here', 'keep', 'bringing', 'up', 'Mamet', 'Mamet', 'Mamet', 'Very', 'few', 'reviewers', 'bring', 'up', 'fact', 'Stuart', 'Gordon', 'directed', 'movie', 'fewer', 'still', 'acknowledge', 'contribution', 'Sure', 'screenplay', 'dialog', 'Mamet', 'doubt', 'indeed', 'Stuart', 'Gordon', 'movie', 'presence', 'just', 'as', 'evident', 'Mamet', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'horror', 'films', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'style', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'directors', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'films', 'usual', 'genre', 'still', 'maintain', 'same', 'feel', 'King', 'Ants', 'was', 'great', 'example', 'Sure', 'bit', 'more', 'cerebral', 'most', 'Gordon', 'previous', 'work', 'most', 'likely', 'Mamet', 'influence', 'Definitely', 'look', 'fans', 'Gordon', 'Mamet', 'William', 'H', 'Macy']",Edmond
1006705,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000GRUQZQ,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 4]","""Edmond,""(2005) has a screenplay by greatly praised American screenwriter/playwright David Mamet( ""Glengarry Ross""),based on his own 1980's stage play of the same name, and was directed by Stuart Gordon.  It boasts some top-drawer acting talent, including many performers long-associated with Mamet.Mamet frequently sets his work in Chicago, his hometown, but ""Edmond"" is set in New York.  William H. Macy, an old hand at Mamet,  stars in the title role, that of Edmond Burke, an anonymous mid-level functionary at some major corporation, and he gives it his best shot.  Edmond is apparently sent off the rails by the fact that a meeting at his corporation, set for the next Monday, has been pushed back a couple of hours.  Oh, and he gets an odd reading from a fortune teller.  Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, plays Edmond's wife, and we have to think she's not sorry to see Edmond go.  Joe Mantegna, a Chicagoan who also has long experience with Mamet, plays a racist no-name guy in a bar, whose rants further help to set Edmond off.  Denise Richards, Ling Bai and Mena Suvari play three unlucky sex workers, whose paths Edmond crosses -- he thinks they're all charging too much.  Julia Stiles plays Glenna, a barmaid, whose crossing paths with Edmond makes her unluckiest of all.Throughout Edmond's grim, gory journey around the pre-Disneyfied sex mart of 42d Street, there's a lot of the snappy, cross-cutting dialogue Mamet is honored for.

And he is one of the most under-rated.Macy plays a man whose marriage has dissolved. His life is a blank wall, and he is searching for a reason to his life. So he starts by looking for a woman, believing sexual contact will help him. Any woman. He goes from a strip bar, to a peep show, to a hooker, and in each place, he is the victim of scams and people who rob him, beat him, and want only his money. In each case, everyone sees him as a mark. In his desperation, after being beaten, and robbed, he finally picks up a waitress who he thinks understands him. BUT, he has slowly descended into madness, and he kills her when she doesn't agree with his `philosophy'.This is a character study of a man who is lost to the world, and after being used and beaten, creates his own morality. A morality that is in opposition to the rigors of `correct society', and destroys him.Watch this dvd for Macy's performance.
