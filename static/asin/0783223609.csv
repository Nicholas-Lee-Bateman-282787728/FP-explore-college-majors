51227,AZV5NGPANACNI,0783223609,,"[0, 0]","I had seen this before, some time back. For whatever reason, it impressed me quite differently than the first time I saw it.  I was more appreciative of William Baldwin's acting ability this time, and of his and Kirk Russell's stunts. They were impressive. However, knowing that Kirk Russell is no longer with us bothered me. It kept coming to my mind, I guess because of all the danger in this movie. It is very well done. This being a serious movie, and so much about life and death, I failed to enjoy the humor that I was apparently supposed to find in Baldwin and some girl making out on top of a fire truck. I recall that I found this scene rather out of place the first time I saw this film. (I doubt that Russell Crowe would have allowed his character to be cheapened by such an out-of place frivolity as this. After all, this was not a comedy.)This movie was sad, and I can appreciate that some humor would have been a nice touch, but that ridiculous scene failed to enhance the image of this character that turned out to be a serious servant of the people, as a fireman. It wasn't that funny either, which -I think_ did not help. If they had to do such a scene, it would have been funnier if it had been a different/new fireman, or if it had to be Baldwin, it could have been less silly. Anyway, I admire the guys for their talent. Also, seeing this heightened my awareness of the power of  fire. So, there youhave it.

51230,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783223609,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 8]","There are many problems with `Backdraft'.  First, the film tries way too hard to be cool instead of realistic, which is a shame considering that a film about firefighters and arson could have been wholly intriguing while remaining believable, had it been attempted properly.  Instead, this film feels so fake and forced that it hurts your brain to try and think about it.  If you walk away from considering this a smart film and just give in to turning off your brain, it is borderline insufferable in many other departments.The acting is atrocious in many areas.  I'm still trying to understand why so many of my cinephile friends are in love with Jennifer Jason Leigh.  I mean, I have yet to see much of her work, but she is usually so `bad', and I mean that in the strongest sense of the term.  She was awful here, just so aware of the character she was playing that she comes across rigid and awkward.  The way she juts her butt out while filming the love scene was so clich&eacute;d and unrealistic, because she knew she was being filmed and tried too hard to portray sexy that she came off like a model and not an actress.  William Baldwin is no Alec.  His performance was horrible.  The way he played puppydog in an attempt to convey depression and self-pity, it was eye-rolling bad.  He reached Keanu Reeves levels of bad here.  Robert De Niro was decent, but he was barely in it.  In fact, the standouts were Russell, who I usually find bland, and Donald Sutherland who was truly scary.And then there is that story.  Yeah, we're back to that.  The paralleled storylines about fraud and arson are played up in a way that overtakes the story and muddles it to becoming contrived and `silly'.  The idea that an arsonist is creating backdrafts to kill certain individuals is preposterous to begin with.  I'm not a firefighter and I know that it would be nearly impossible to do that, and it would certainly be impossible to do it to the extent that the arsonist does here.The action scenes are impressive, and the special effects are still rather extraordinary.  Sadly, they are usually corroded by laughable dialog and situations that are so fake it makes me cringe.  The rooftop argument in particular is ridiculous (hey, this building is burning and crumbling under our feet, and it's our job to put this fire out, but let's waste our time arguing about this for a few critical minutes).Yeah, I was prepared to give this two stars for the special effects and Sutherland's creepy performance, but the more I think about this movie the less and less I can forgive it.",1,Burns to the ground before my very eyes...,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,2573,"['are', 'many', 'problems', 'Backdraft', 'First', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'cool', 'instead', 'realistic', 'shame', 'considering', 'film', 'firefighters', 'arson', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wholly', 'intriguing', 'remaining', 'believable', 'had', 'been', 'attempted', 'properly', 'Instead', 'film', 'feels', 'so', 'fake', 'forced', 'brain', 'try', 'think', 'walk', 'away', 'considering', 'smart', 'film', 'just', 'give', 'turning', 'off', 'brain', 'borderline', 'insufferable', 'many', 'other', 'departments.The', 'acting', 'atrocious', 'many', 'areas', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'cinephile', 'friends', 'are', 'love', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'mean', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'much', 'work', 'usually', 'so', 'bad', 'mean', 'strongest', 'sense', 'term', 'was', 'awful', 'here', 'just', 'so', 'aware', 'character', 'was', 'playing', 'rigid', 'awkward', 'way', 'butt', 'out', 'filming', 'love', 'scene', 'was', 'so', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'unrealistic', 'knew', 'was', 'being', 'filmed', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'portray', 'sexy', 'came', 'off', 'model', 'not', 'actress', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'Alec', 'performance', 'was', 'horrible', 'way', 'played', 'puppydog', 'attempt', 'convey', 'depression', 'self-pity', 'was', 'eye-rolling', 'bad', 'reached', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'levels', 'bad', 'here', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'was', 'decent', 'was', 'barely', 'fact', 'standouts', 'were', 'Russell', 'who', 'usually', 'find', 'bland', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'was', 'truly', 'scary.And', 'then', 'story', 'Yeah', ""'re"", 'back', 'paralleled', 'storylines', 'fraud', 'arson', 'are', 'played', 'up', 'way', 'story', 'becoming', 'contrived', 'silly', 'idea', 'arsonist', 'creating', 'backdrafts', 'kill', 'certain', 'individuals', 'preposterous', 'begin', ""'m"", 'not', 'firefighter', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'do', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'impossible', 'do', 'extent', 'arsonist', 'here.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'still', 'rather', 'extraordinary', 'Sadly', 'are', 'usually', 'corroded', 'laughable', 'dialog', 'situations', 'are', 'so', 'fake', 'cringe', 'rooftop', 'argument', 'particular', 'ridiculous', 'hey', 'building', 'burning', 'crumbling', 'feet', 'job', 'put', 'fire', 'let', 'waste', 'time', 'arguing', 'few', 'critical', 'minutes', '.Yeah', 'was', 'prepared', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'special', 'effects', 'Sutherland', 'creepy', 'performance', 'more', 'think', 'movie', 'less', 'less', 'can', 'forgive']",N/A
51231,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0783223609,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 5/12Rate: 55/12: I remember seeing Backdraft when it came out in early 90's, thinking that I came away unimpressed with it. Seeing it to reconsider my opinion, nothing has changed. It is still a mediocre film which is a surprise because it was directed by Ron Howard, who can do better than that. This was an all-star cast, but everybody was terrible. Only Kurt Russell shined through, and he was enjoyable as usual. A lot of people had said William Baldwin was the worst of the film, and they panned his performance. To be honest, he was as good as everybody else sans Kurt. The ludicrous plot was the chief reason why the film stank, and even worse were the unrealistic firefighting scenes. How often do backdrafts occur? Honestly, not so much. Yet in the movie, it became commonplace. Then, saving babies and kids every time a fire broke out...yeah, that'll do. How about the scenes where the firefighters will place themselves in harm's way constantly just because it was cool and all that? Impossible. They will be mostly outside and pumping the water out on the roofs. Oh yeah, what was so interesting about the scenes with the fires was that...there was absolutely no SMOKE anywhere. This made me to laugh. There is a saying, ""Where there's smoke, there's fire.""  Back to the plot, the alderman...hmmm, he was the crook, but why would he push the inspector to look for the causes of the death of the victims? Sort of like he wanted to be caught on purpose eventually. Made no sense to me. All in all, at least Backdraft is the best film made about firefighters or fire for that being said.",3,Watch It Solely for the Fire and Kurt Russell.,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,1604,"['Viewed', '5/12Rate', '55/12', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Backdraft', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'early', '90', 'thinking', 'came', 'away', 'unimpressed', 'Seeing', 'reconsider', 'opinion', 'nothing', 'changed', 'still', 'mediocre', 'film', 'surprise', 'was', 'directed', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'was', 'all-star', 'cast', 'everybody', 'was', 'terrible', 'Only', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'shined', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'usual', 'lot', 'people', 'had', 'said', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'was', 'worst', 'film', 'panned', 'performance', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'everybody', 'else', 'Kurt', 'ludicrous', 'plot', 'was', 'chief', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'stank', 'even', 'worse', 'were', 'unrealistic', 'firefighting', 'scenes', 'How', 'often', 'do', 'backdrafts', 'occur', 'Honestly', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'became', 'commonplace', 'Then', 'saving', 'babies', 'kids', 'time', 'fire', 'broke', 'out', 'yeah', ""'ll"", 'do', 'How', 'scenes', 'where', 'firefighters', 'will', 'place', 'harm', 'way', 'constantly', 'just', 'was', 'cool', 'Impossible', 'will', 'be', 'mostly', 'outside', 'pumping', 'water', 'out', 'roofs', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'fires', 'was', 'was', 'absolutely', 'SMOKE', 'anywhere', 'made', 'laugh', 'saying', 'Where', 'smoke', 'fire', 'Back', 'plot', 'alderman', 'hmmm', 'was', 'crook', 'why', 'would', 'push', 'inspector', 'look', 'causes', 'death', 'victims', 'Sort', 'wanted', 'be', 'caught', 'purpose', 'eventually', 'Made', 'sense', 'least', 'Backdraft', 'best', 'film', 'made', 'firefighters', 'fire', 'being', 'said']",N/A
51232,ALR35EFI69S5R,0783223609,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[4, 4]","Viewed in the context of a post 911 world, this terrific film directed by Ron Howard becomes even more meaningful as a detailed portrait of the lives and lifestyles of a group of Chicago firemen trying to come to terms with as series of violet arson/murders plaguing the metropolitan landscape. And, given Kurt Russell's appeal as an action hero, this gorgeously filmed epic take on the look and feel of a travelogue into a fiery Hell! The cast is uniformly superb, ranging from Russell as the older brother whose intimidating presence is so troubling for William Baldwin, who is trying to join what amounts to the family business, and one their hero father died in the line of duty participating in.Also terrific here is Scott Glenn as one of the senior firemen on Russell's squad, and Jennifer Jason Leigh as Baldwin's long-lost love now working for an ambitious local city council member. Robert DeNiro appears as an eclectic and somewhat iconoclastic specialist trying to piece together the forensic evidence, and Donald Sutherland makes a cameo as a Looney-tunes firebug who absolutely thrills at the sight, smells and sounds of the backdraft. And of course, the quite lovely Rebecca DeMornay does an interesting turn as Russell's estranged wife, trying to come to terms with how to live either with or without him.The story is quite absorbing, as are the series of vignettes bringing us deep into the world of the individual firemen. As a result, we come to quickly care about what happens to these characters as they suit up and slip down the pole to the waiting fire-truck, en route to yet another inferno. The drama works very well, and the action sequences are both realistic and spectacular, and the way the characters are developed and presented adds immeasurably to the story line.

51236,AM1VFW804J5FL,0783223609,"""bulldog51""","[12, 15]","&quot;Backdraft is the story of two brothers.  After the death of their firefighter father, older brother Steven (Kurt Russell) follows Dad's footsteps into the Chicago Fire Department.  Younger brother Brian (William Baldwin) bounces from one scam or get-rich-quick scheme to another.  But Brian eventually winds up back in Chicago in the Fire Department, and in Steven's Co. 17, no less.  They go back and forth for a while, until finally Steven drives Brian out of the department and into arson investigation.  Brian winds up working for an arson investigator (Robert De Niro) investigating a series of murders-by-arson.This movie features a stellar cast, giving mostly excellent performances.  Special notice should be given to Russell, in what I think is his best performance ever.  J.T. Walsh gives an excellent supporting performance as the sleazy Alderman Swayczak, as do Rebecca De Mornay as Steven's estranged wife and Scott Glenn as Firefighter &quot;Axe&quot; Adcox.  Donald Sutherland is especially creepy, yet charming as an imprisoned arsonist to whom De Niro and Baldwin go to for advice on identifying the arsonist.  Baldwin and Jennifer Jason Leigh (playing Brian's girlfriend and Swayczak's aide) could have held up their parts better, but that doesn't detract from the movie as a whole.The fire is the real star of this movie.  The special effects are truly incredible, and have to be seen to be believed.  This movie boasts the best effects I've ever seen in a non-science-fiction movie.  Whoever the effects man is should have won an Oscar for the fire scenes in this movie.Some may criticize the ending for being overly sentimental, but every single time I see this movie, I get choked up during Steven's last scenes.  As an older brother, I really identified with Steven and how he wants the best for his brother, but he isn't quite sure of the line between pushing him to improve and pushing him down.The special effects alone are worth getting this movie, but director Ron Howard put together an all-star cast that (mostly) managed to put together a movie in which the plot isn't entirely overshadowed by the effects.

The show has been garnering a somewhat rabid cult following in the U.S. over the past couple of years, and it was on one of the many fan sites that I learned that the producers of the program had utilized the &quot;Backdraft&quot; soundtrack for most of the music. And now it seems oddly appropriate, what with all the flames licking at sumptuous slabs of Kobe beef, octopus, and foie gras.And HEY, the movie isn't so bad either. Although I have a lot of respect for Ron Howard as a director, a drama about Chicago firefighters didn't really seem to be my cup of tea. I'm definitely NOT a fan of Kurt Russell's testosterone-laden style of acting. But overall this is a pretty compelling film with some notable pluses, in particular Donald Sutherland as the Hannibal Lecter of pyromaniacs, Robert De Niro as the tough arson investigator, and some really cool visual and sound effects that are particularly impressive on a good home theater system.Of course, if you are a fan of &quot;Iron Chef,&quot; you'll be hard-pressed not to lapse into some color commentary whenever the camera lingers on a smoking corpse. &quot;Morimoto has incorporated a shattered windshield into a particularly stunning and profound presentation!&quot;",3,Essential viewing for fans of &quot;IRON CHEF&quot;,974160000,"11 14, 2000",2000,1650,"['partner', 'Greg', 'amp', 'would', 'NEVER', 'have', 'bothered', 'rent', 'DVD', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'soundtrack', 'used', 'most', 'incidental', 'music', 'Japanese', 'cooking', 'competition', 'quot', 'Iron', 'Chef', 'quot', 'Friday', 'amp', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'Food', 'Network', 'quot', 'Iron', 'Chef', 'quot', 'one', 'show', ""'ve"", 'come', 'watch', 'most', 'religiously', 'past', 'year', 'Think', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'gourmet', 'cooks', 'show', 'been', 'garnering', 'somewhat', 'rabid', 'cult', 'following', 'U.S.', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'fan', 'sites', 'learned', 'producers', 'program', 'had', 'utilized', 'quot', 'Backdraft', 'quot', 'soundtrack', 'most', 'music', 'now', 'oddly', 'appropriate', 'what', 'flames', 'licking', 'sumptuous', 'slabs', 'Kobe', 'beef', 'octopus', 'foie', 'gras.And', 'HEY', 'movie', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'either', 'have', 'lot', 'respect', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'director', 'drama', 'Chicago', 'firefighters', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'NOT', 'fan', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'testosterone-laden', 'style', 'acting', 'overall', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'film', 'notable', 'pluses', 'particular', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'pyromaniacs', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'tough', 'arson', 'investigator', 'really', 'cool', 'visual', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'good', 'home', 'theater', 'system.Of', 'course', 'are', 'fan', 'quot', 'Iron', 'Chef', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'not', 'lapse', 'color', 'commentary', 'whenever', 'camera', 'smoking', 'corpse', 'quot', 'Morimoto', 'incorporated', 'shattered', 'windshield', 'particularly', 'stunning', 'profound', 'presentation', 'quot']",N/A

51240,A1J6WQF5OY4DIV,0783223609,"Christian Puzder ""C. Puzder""","[1, 3]","Ron Howardfs breakout mega-film of the early 90fs. A huge hit in the theatres, you would think a movie about big fires would translate well into HD c and it does. Like all our reviews, we skip the plot reviews because we want to know whether you should buy this movie in HD DVD or just use an upconverted SD DVD. I donft want to dote on character development (which is heavy in this movie) becasue it matters not to the HD quality. So, in short, this Universal release is a very cool movie about Chicago firemen as told through the voice of two firefighting brothers. Firefighters are unique civil servants in that they lack authority some other civil servants possess. This makes a firefighter a true hero. Obviously, then, Backdraft asserts itself as a tribute to these unique heroes.Having watched many recently produced movies on HD DVD and many movies produced more than 20 years ago movies on HD DVD I am beginning to see a major difference in the pre-effects days in Hollywood. Backdraft is probably one of the last great action/drama movies that does not rely on effects to make things look perfect. The transfer to HD is grand but what remains is that late 80fs/early 90fs movie quality. We still have to deal with the 2 minute musical interlude to show activity: building a house, falling in love, or learning how to be a firefighter. Backdraft probably looked awesome in a theatre (I have to admit I never saw it in the theatre). The explosions and fires still hold up, and thatfs what this movie is about, but having been indoctrinated into HD with movies like Transformers where the action occurs all around you, and not just in front of you on the screen, even on a 56 TV the anamorphic 70mm looks kinda dinky. You have to respect the fact, however, that the fire in this movies is real and not digitally added. While this retains the uniqueness of the movie, it limits the directorfs ability to make a truly immersive picture. I am confident, however, that when shooting the film, cinematographer Mikael Salomon probably never said, gGee, I wonder how this will look in HD from a couchh. All old skool movie making aside, the HD picture was great - with no discernable flaws (as were exhibited in Dune, our next review).Like most of the movies I like in HD, what makes this movie special in HD is the audio mix. Its a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix (No true HD for you Dr. Jones!) Where the cinematographer was limited the engineer really made this HD transfer shine. The fires engulfed us not with its images, but with its roar and grumbles. Additionally, the subtle environmental effects added that special favor to this movie.The extras are forgettable. Universal, regreattable, spent no time on the menu system either which is the typical polished silver Universal HD DVD menu.Did I like this movie? Yes. Did I like the HD transfer? sure. Would I recommend it? Yes, but there are about 50 other HD DVD movies I would get before this one - unless, of course, this is one of your all-time favorties.",3,Recommended,1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,3007,"['Ron', 'Howardfs', 'mega-film', 'early', '90fs', 'huge', 'hit', 'theatres', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'big', 'fires', 'would', 'translate', 'well', 'HD', 'c', 'reviews', 'skip', 'plot', 'reviews', 'want', 'know', 'should', 'buy', 'movie', 'HD', 'DVD', 'just', 'use', 'upconverted', 'SD', 'DVD', 'donft', 'want', 'dote', 'character', 'development', 'heavy', 'movie', 'becasue', 'not', 'HD', 'quality', 'So', 'short', 'Universal', 'release', 'very', 'cool', 'movie', 'Chicago', 'firemen', 'told', 'voice', 'two', 'firefighting', 'brothers', 'Firefighters', 'are', 'unique', 'civil', 'servants', 'lack', 'authority', 'other', 'civil', 'servants', 'possess', 'firefighter', 'true', 'hero', 'Obviously', 'then', 'Backdraft', 'tribute', 'unique', 'heroes.Having', 'watched', 'many', 'recently', 'produced', 'movies', 'HD', 'DVD', 'many', 'movies', 'produced', 'more', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'movies', 'HD', 'DVD', 'am', 'beginning', 'see', 'major', 'difference', 'pre-effects', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'Backdraft', 'probably', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'action/drama', 'movies', 'not', 'rely', 'effects', 'make', 'things', 'look', 'perfect', 'transfer', 'HD', 'grand', 'what', 'late', '80fs/early', '90fs', 'movie', 'quality', 'still', 'have', 'deal', '2', 'minute', 'musical', 'interlude', 'show', 'activity', 'building', 'house', 'falling', 'love', 'learning', 'how', 'be', 'firefighter', 'Backdraft', 'probably', 'looked', 'awesome', 'theatre', 'have', 'admit', 'never', 'saw', 'theatre', 'explosions', 'fires', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'thatfs', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'having', 'been', 'indoctrinated', 'HD', 'movies', 'Transformers', 'where', 'action', 'not', 'just', 'front', 'screen', 'even', '56', 'TV', 'anamorphic', '70mm', 'kinda', 'dinky', 'have', 'respect', 'fact', 'however', 'fire', 'movies', 'real', 'not', 'digitally', 'added', 'uniqueness', 'movie', 'directorfs', 'ability', 'make', 'truly', 'immersive', 'picture', 'am', 'confident', 'however', 'when', 'shooting', 'film', 'cinematographer', 'Mikael', 'Salomon', 'probably', 'never', 'said', 'gGee', 'wonder', 'how', 'will', 'look', 'HD', 'couchh', 'old', 'skool', 'movie', 'making', 'aside', 'HD', 'picture', 'was', 'great', 'discernable', 'flaws', 'were', 'exhibited', 'Dune', 'next', 'review', 'most', 'movies', 'like', 'HD', 'what', 'movie', 'special', 'HD', 'audio', 'mix', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'mix', 'true', 'HD', 'Dr', 'Jones', 'Where', 'cinematographer', 'was', 'limited', 'engineer', 'really', 'made', 'HD', 'transfer', 'shine', 'fires', 'engulfed', 'not', 'images', 'roar', 'grumbles', 'Additionally', 'subtle', 'environmental', 'effects', 'added', 'special', 'favor', 'movie.The', 'extras', 'are', 'forgettable', 'Universal', 'regreattable', 'spent', 'time', 'menu', 'system', 'typical', 'polished', 'silver', 'Universal', 'HD', 'DVD', 'menu.Did', 'movie', 'Yes', 'Did', 'like', 'HD', 'transfer', 'sure', 'Would', 'recommend', 'Yes', 'are', '50', 'other', 'HD', 'DVD', 'movies', 'would', 'get', 'one', 'course', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorties']",N/A

51244,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,0783223609,Cubist,"[10, 11]","At the time of its release, Backdraft was regarded by some critics as an admirable if not flawed homage to the profession of firefighting. Of course, compared to the recent Ladder 49 it seems downright gritty and hard-hitting but still doesn't hold a candle in terms of realism to television's Rescue Me. Still, Ron Howard's film has its heart in the right place and does boast an impressive cast. Looking back at it now, Backdraft was one of Howard's early attempts to be taken seriously as a dramatic filmmaker and an initial bid at Oscar glory - something that would elude him until A Beautiful Mind.Howard's film dutifully trots out the stereotypical characters: the long-suffering ex-wife (DeMornay), the gorgeous but otherwise unimportant love interest (Jason Leigh), the crazy killer (Sutherland), the gung-ho recruit (Gedrick) who is punished for his inexperience, the feuding brothers and so on. What Backdraft does have going for it is how it shows the camaraderie of the men in the firehouse: the good-natured hazing of the new guys, the communal meals and how they watch each other's backs in and out of fires. It is very much a brotherhood and this film brings this out very well.Speaking of which, the firefighting scenes are well-staged and executed, done before the proliferation of CGI and this gives these scenes a real, visceral quality. It is like the fire is another character, a living, breathing organism with a life of its own and the ability to take one as well. Howard's camera is able to get into the thick of these fires so that there is no safe distance in which to remove oneself from the action. You're right in there with the firefighters.The best scene in the movie isn't the impressively staged fires but the one between Donald Sutherland's twitchy, crazed arsonist and De Niro's investigator. It lasts only a few minutes but every moment between these two brilliant actors is mesmerizing and truly brings the film to life proving yet again that good acting trumps SFX and stunts every damn time. In fact, Backdraft should have focused on De Niro's intriguing character and his intuitive knowledge of how fires work and what causes them. The screenplay hints at an interesting backstory for him and his relationship with Sutherland's firebug. Instead, it amounts to nothing more than a subplot and a red herring of sorts.The first disc features an introduction by Ron Howard as he briefly talks about how proud he is of the movie and what else is available on this 2-disc set.There is 43 minutes worth of deleted scenes that sheds light on Brian's backstory -- his nomadic existence, how he dropped out of the academy years ago and how he talks his way back in. There is also more footage of the mysterious arsonist plying his trade that reveals a little too much a little too early in the movie. We also get more of De Niro and Sutherland which is always a treat.The second disc starts off with ""Igniting the Story,"" a featurette that traces the origins of the project as Howard and his producer Brian Grazer talk about what drew them to it. The screenwriters talk about the genesis of the screenplay while the term ""backdraft"" is also explained.""Bringing Them Together: The Team"" examines the casting process. Howard knew Kurt Russell from back when they were child actors and had always wanted to cast him in one of his movies. Baldwin, Glenn, Gedrick and, surprisingly, Jason Leigh (who never seemed too enthused about this project) talk about how they got involved in new interviews for this DVD.""The Explosive Stunts"" takes a look at how they pulled off the realistically rendered firefighting scenes. The highlight of this extra is Scott Glenn recounting a particularly dangerous stunt where he came very close to getting seriously burned.""Creating the Villain: The Fire."" After computer effects tests failed, the special effects guys ran all kinds of practical tests to see the various ways they could manipulate fire. Everything was planned out beforehand.Finally, there is ""Real-Life Firemen, Real-Life Stories"" with actual firefighters from Station 73 in Santa Clarita, California recounting some of their own personal anecdotes and what they think of the movie. These guys really love what they do and speak passionately about it.",3,a flawed but admirable effort,1160524800,"10 11, 2006",2006,4276,"['time', 'release', 'Backdraft', 'was', 'regarded', 'critics', 'admirable', 'not', 'flawed', 'homage', 'profession', 'firefighting', 'course', 'compared', 'recent', 'Ladder', '49', 'downright', 'gritty', 'hard-hitting', 'still', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'terms', 'realism', 'television', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'Still', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'film', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'boast', 'impressive', 'cast', 'Looking', 'back', 'now', 'Backdraft', 'was', 'one', 'Howard', 'early', 'attempts', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'dramatic', 'filmmaker', 'initial', 'bid', 'Oscar', 'glory', 'something', 'would', 'elude', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind.Howard', 'film', 'dutifully', 'out', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'long-suffering', 'ex-wife', 'DeMornay', 'gorgeous', 'otherwise', 'unimportant', 'love', 'interest', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'crazy', 'killer', 'Sutherland', 'gung-ho', 'recruit', 'Gedrick', 'who', 'punished', 'inexperience', 'feuding', 'brothers', 'so', 'What', 'Backdraft', 'have', 'going', 'how', 'camaraderie', 'men', 'firehouse', 'good-natured', 'hazing', 'new', 'guys', 'communal', 'meals', 'how', 'watch', 'other', 'backs', 'fires', 'very', 'much', 'brotherhood', 'film', 'out', 'very', 'well.Speaking', 'firefighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'well-staged', 'executed', 'done', 'proliferation', 'CGI', 'scenes', 'real', 'visceral', 'quality', 'fire', 'character', 'living', 'breathing', 'organism', 'life', 'own', 'ability', 'take', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'Howard', 'camera', 'able', 'get', 'thick', 'fires', 'so', 'safe', 'distance', 'remove', 'action', ""'re"", 'right', 'firefighters.The', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', ""n't"", 'impressively', 'staged', 'fires', 'one', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'twitchy', 'crazed', 'arsonist', 'De', 'Niro', 'investigator', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'moment', 'two', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'mesmerizing', 'truly', 'film', 'life', 'proving', 'yet', 'again', 'good', 'acting', 'trumps', 'SFX', 'stunts', 'damn', 'time', 'fact', 'Backdraft', 'should', 'have', 'focused', 'De', 'Niro', 'intriguing', 'character', 'intuitive', 'knowledge', 'how', 'fires', 'work', 'what', 'screenplay', 'hints', 'interesting', 'backstory', 'relationship', 'Sutherland', 'firebug', 'Instead', 'nothing', 'more', 'subplot', 'red', 'herring', 'sorts.The', 'first', 'disc', 'introduction', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'talks', 'how', 'proud', 'movie', 'what', 'else', 'available', '2-disc', 'set.There', '43', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'sheds', 'light', 'Brian', 'backstory', 'nomadic', 'existence', 'how', 'dropped', 'academy', 'years', 'ago', 'how', 'way', 'back', 'also', 'more', 'footage', 'mysterious', 'arsonist', 'plying', 'trade', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'little', 'too', 'early', 'movie', 'also', 'get', 'more', 'De', 'Niro', 'Sutherland', 'always', 'treat.The', 'second', 'disc', 'Igniting', 'Story', 'featurette', 'origins', 'project', 'Howard', 'producer', 'Brian', 'Grazer', 'talk', 'what', 'drew', 'screenwriters', 'talk', 'genesis', 'screenplay', 'term', 'backdraft', 'also', 'explained', 'Bringing', 'Them', 'Together', 'Team', 'casting', 'process', 'Howard', 'knew', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'back', 'when', 'were', 'child', 'actors', 'had', 'always', 'wanted', 'cast', 'one', 'movies', 'Baldwin', 'Glenn', 'Gedrick', 'surprisingly', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'who', 'never', 'seemed', 'too', 'enthused', 'project', 'talk', 'how', 'got', 'involved', 'new', 'interviews', 'DVD', 'Explosive', 'Stunts', 'look', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', 'realistically', 'rendered', 'firefighting', 'scenes', 'highlight', 'extra', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'recounting', 'particularly', 'dangerous', 'stunt', 'where', 'came', 'very', 'close', 'getting', 'seriously', 'burned', 'Creating', 'Villain', 'Fire', 'computer', 'effects', 'tests', 'failed', 'special', 'effects', 'guys', 'ran', 'kinds', 'practical', 'tests', 'see', 'various', 'ways', 'could', 'manipulate', 'fire', 'Everything', 'was', 'planned', 'out', 'beforehand.Finally', 'Real-Life', 'Firemen', 'Real-Life', 'Stories', 'actual', 'firefighters', 'Station', '73', 'Santa', 'Clarita', 'California', 'recounting', 'own', 'personal', 'anecdotes', 'what', 'think', 'movie', 'guys', 'really', 'love', 'what', 'do', 'speak', 'passionately']",N/A

Punctuating their interactions are several incidents of arson, where fire is portrayed as living thing--almost like one of the characters in the movie.  This brings a mystery/thriller angle to the plot.I saw Backdraft twenty years ago when it first came out, but had forgotten how good it is.  Ron Howard has given us a compelling story with good performances.  It is a tribute to the courage and sacrifice of those who wear the uniform.  One small quibble: Robert Deniro has a relatively small part in the movie, which seems like a waste of good talent.Despite the fact that the movie is more than twenty years old, the blu-ray transfer is well done.  The fire looks great--like you are right there.  In fact, I cannot think of another movie that does fire so well.  I am thankful that the moviemakers decided to use the real stuff rather than go digital--it would have looked cheesy.Parental Advisory: the movie is rated R for violence, language and some sensuality.  On multiple occasions we see people burning or the corpses of those who have been burned.  One shower room scene shows a couple of firemen from the rear.  There is also smoking and drunkenness in a few scenes.  This is not a movie for children.I recommend this blu-ray version of Backdraft.

51250,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,0783223609,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[2, 5]","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I still have a lot of memories of being thrilled when watching this movie so many times when I was younger when this movie was released all those years ago and now nearly 13 years after it's release, ""Backdraft"" still succeeds on all fronts in delivering the action and explosive fiery special effects. In regards to certain events of recent times, this movie has become very compelling on both a personal and worldly level. It even reminds me of when much of Chicago looked so gritty back around the late 1980s and early 1990s even in some of the nicer neighborhoods around that period in time. Plus it also kind of explores the unknown areas. While the movie isn't based on a true story, the writer behind this film witnessed a comrade actually lose his life because of a backdraft which blasted him across a street and into a fence. It was this loss that inspired him to write the storyline of this movie.Anyhow let's get to the movie. It's a tale of two feuding McCaffrey brothers Stephen and Brian McCaffrey who have generally been at odds with each other for almost their whole lives but both of their lives are changed when their father Dennis and now amidst the conflict they've had with each other, the two struggle to carry on the family firefighting business. Amidst their longstanding distant relations, their fire department is grappled with a large outbreak of arson attacks that have been occurring at a disturbingly frequent rate in Chicago and the whole department is at a fast pace to track down the causes, and possibly the one responsible for the fires. Also, another major hurdle in the fire department's investigation into the cause of the numerous fires sweeping Chicago ARE major funding cutbacks from an inept bureaucratic alderman (played by the late J.T.Walsh) and it's making an already dangerous task a much bigger headache not only for lieutenant Rimgale, but also making things a lot more complicated for the feuding McCaffrey Brothers.Back when this movie was new back in the early 1990s, I enjoyed it for its edge-of-your seat action but today, I love this movie for many more reasons now. First, the movie's tale of the heroism of firefighting and how they are ready and not afraid to put their own lives on hold to save others is absolutely gripping and sometimes saddening to know but also very compelling. Another thing that really makes this compelling as well is the sometimes heartbreaking tale of what it's like to be in the shadow of an experienced firefighter who is also one's own brother. Although I've experienced little sibling conflict, as a younger brother, I can especially understand all the insecurity of what Brian goes through in this movie. The movie is also very compelling with the intense and rich music by composer Hans Zimmer. The fiery special effects are absolutely amazing especially for it's time.However, I would have to say that I have noticed some occasional flaws in this movie but they do not take away any of its power and entertainment factor by any stretch of the imagination. Perhaps the greatest speed bump is that this defies some of the real life laws of physics. In several scenes, the firefighters go right into the burning buildings with no gas masks and no oxygen tanks either. This is probably what has turned some people off here. In real life, these firefighters in this movie would have suffered third degree burns and burned to death in just a matter of minutes but also there are also the numerous noxious fumes that fires can generate and they would have suffered permanent and or serious lung damage from the heat of the hot air and the smoke. That brings to mind, in several of the fires in this movie, I have noticed little smoke in many of them. I've seen cooking grills in the backyard generate smoke than some of the scenes in the movie. These are just some things that I feel were evident in this movie but I guess even then, it would've been impossible to create a movie that would perfectly follow the laws of physics especially one like ""Backdraft"" so I forgive them for this and it doesn't subtract any stars from the ratings.I give my hands down to Kurt Russell and William Baldwin who played the emotionally distant brothers Stephen ""The Bull"" and Brian McCaffrey. Kurt Russell's role as Stephen was very intense and sometimes heart-wrenching as he played the emotionally unstable elder McCaffrey brother. I especially was moved by William Baldwin's portrayal as the younger firefighter brother Brian. Although I've gotten along very well with my older brother on an overall note, but as a younger sibling, I especially identify quite well with Brian's character. It's very emotionally heartbreaking seeing the often very fractious relations between the two firefighting siblings especially towards the latter half of the movie. The other cast are really great as well. Robert De Niro's role as the lieutenant Donald Rimgale was so cool especially when Rimgale is disgruntled when trying to find out the causes of all of these numerous fires. I really feel that De Niro's role is hindered by the fact that Rimgale is more of a background character than a major character. Although only a minor role and in a few scattered scenes, I really thought that Donald Sutherlands role as the former arsonist Donald Bartel was absolutely a thrill to watch and even very chilling at times. The only disappointing thing about Rimgale and Bartel is that this movie doesn't allow much insight into these two and I felt they could really have used more development. While not to the degree of dropping the ball necessarily, the female roles of Rebecca De Mornay as Stephen's estranged wife, and Jennifer Jason Leigh as the secretary to the alderman I felt were rather unremarkable in my opinion.Everyone involved with this project deserves all of the praise that they can get. Not only have they created a very entertaining film, they've also succeeded in making a very compelling and heroic movie about the most underappreciated heroes that our country is blessed with. The ending is also very touching in a way the few movies do once finished. ""Backdraft"" is one of the most underrated movies of the past 25 years and is one of the greatest action movies ever made. If I were to pick a favorite of mines from Ron Howard, ""Backdraft"" is my pick for his best movie to date not only because of excellent directing but because of a highly compelling plot, excellent script and incredible special effects as well. The music, courtesy of Hans Zimmer, is absolutely amazing and makes this movie even more compelling and encouraging to the extent that it almost makes you want to do something good for society. I highly recommend that you get your hands on a copy of this movie because it's one of the most compelling and emotional movies that has ever been made. The ending is really one of the most moving endings I've ever seen in a movie outside of ""Lord of The Rings: Return of The King"". The DVD unfortunately offers little in the way of extras and the transfer is asking for a better re-transfer for perhaps a ""Special Edition"" DVD some unknown future.",5,"""You Go...We

Speaking of De Mornay, it must be written into all of her movie contracts that she has at least one scene where she takes off her clothes. We also see the great Chicago skyline and the brick structures, including the burning ones, that make up the majority of buildings in the town. We also get to see why William Baldwin doesn't get more acting jobs. What a whiner! Jennifer Jason Leigh looks awful in either a bad hair dye job or a really awful wig. J.T. Walsh is Alderman Swayszak and right away, because he is in the movie, you know he is a bad guy. That's also his name because, in Chicago, at least a few of the 40-some alderman are going to be Polish. The ending is, of course, big.

51257,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0783223609,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[9, 19]","My father was a fire fighter, so when I was growing up I spent a great deal of time hanging around the fire station.  And virtually any one who knows anything at all about fire fighting will tell you this is one of the most completely unrealistic films you could ever hope to see.  Fire fighters rush into buring yet strangely smokeless rooms with their coats flapping open and without the proper safety equipment, and in spite of the title's implication the phenomena they are talking about is called &quot;flashover,&quot; not &quot;backdraft.&quot;  In fact, there are so many inaccuracies in this film that a grad student could probably catalogue them as a doctorial thesis.All this having been said, BACKDRAFT is the well-crafted but essentially superficial film typical of director Ron Howard: everything is very, very slick and looks good on the screen, particularly the male leads.  The story itself concerns two brothers (Kurt Russell and William Baldwin) who somehow find themselves employed by the same unit and who must bury their differences to combat a wiley arsonist with the aid of their able Lieutenant (Robert De Niro) and a flakey advisor who knows about pyromanics since he himself used to be one (Donald Sutherland.)  The cast is good, the script is mechanical, and the plot is improbable--but all of this is actually beside the point, because everything about the film exists only as an excuse for lots of special effects.And it is here that the film finally gets good marks.  The pyrotechnics are great, and the film actually manages to create the impression of an out-of-control fire as something akin to a ravening beast--very impressive, and often as not more than a little unnerving.  And so for once the fire, not the fire fighters, saves the day by making the film mildly enjoyable.

51268,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,0783223609,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[12, 15]","`It lives, it breathes and it hates'.  This is the description made by Robert DeNiro's character in Backdraft, stating the volatile nature of something we all fear, but rely on; Fire.Backdraft is a different movie, filled with characters who are flawed and angry with one another.  There are many messages that go along with this movie.  I'm not sure where Ron Howard was going with the relationships of the characters, maybe no where and that's ok.  Why try so hard to make the relationships go somewhere in such a short amount of time when we can clearly tell that the issues between them are a result of a lifetime of hardships and disagreements.  These are not the kind of disputes that get resolved in a short period of time, if ever.  You can take away what you want from the movie in that respect.The movie centers around Brian McCaffrey (William Baldwin), who returns home to Chicago after years of failed business ventures to make sure he doesn't follow the family line of becoming a Firefighter.  After giving in and completing the Fire Academy, he is placed in his brother's company, one of the toughest.  His brother Steven (Kurt Russell) is still a bit annoyed with him for not deciding to become a fireman right off the bat (Chicago firefighters have a stout tradition for family continuance and stubborn old fashioned fire fighting that has no room for progressive tactics).  He seems determined to make sure Brian either stays with it and becomes as good as he is, or quits.  Brian takes it personally at every turn.  Sibling rivalry ensues.Subplots abound as we learn that fire stations are being closed for political purposes and Brian finds he has feelings for childhood friend (Jennifer Jason Leigh).  DeNiro plays Donald Rimgale, the Fire Investigator that is looking into the Backdraft murders (a phenomenon that causes a fire in a closed room to subside after using all the oxygen, but explodes when O2 is reintroduced from the open door), high level politicians and businessman are being killed with this method and it becomes an MO.  DeNiro is solid in his role as the Arson investigator, spouting lines about loving fire and understanding it's nature.  Kurt Russell is good as he swaggers through his role, a character who attacks fire, knowing for some reason that he won't ever be killed by it.  Baldwin seems lost as usual, but the character himself is somewhat lost trying to decide what to do in his personal struggle.  Leigh doesn't seem interested in her role but manages to get through and Rebecca De Mornay plays the small role she has as Steven's estranged wife with great world-weary realism.  Scott Glenn, mercilessly put in a shaved down role, is good as well.  The best character though is Donald Sutherland, playing Ronald Bartel, a pyro-psycho who is locked up in a mental institution.  He comes up for release occasionally and Rimgale goes in and repeatedly proves just how insane he still is, no matter what he tricks the doctors and release board into thinking.  Sutherland is obviously having the most fun with his part.  His character is called upon to help find out who is behind the Backdraft murders.The biggest character of the film though is the fire, and it is astounding.  Even though the movie is over 11 years old, it holds up today.  With a combination of real fire exaggerated with computer affects in some spots, the visual result is frightening and actually looks alive in some scenes.  All in all, the movie is good, although there are a lot of elements squeezed in to make it somewhat epic, and even though it doesn't quite reach that status, it is a good all around movie with great action, emotion and special effects.",4,Fire has it's own character,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,3682,"['description', 'made', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'character', 'Backdraft', 'stating', 'volatile', 'nature', 'something', 'fear', 'rely', 'Fire.Backdraft', 'different', 'movie', 'filled', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'flawed', 'angry', 'one', 'are', 'many', 'messages', 'go', 'along', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'was', 'going', 'relationships', 'characters', 'maybe', 'where', 'ok.', 'Why', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'relationships', 'go', 'somewhere', 'such', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'when', 'can', 'clearly', 'tell', 'issues', 'are', 'result', 'lifetime', 'hardships', 'disagreements', 'are', 'not', 'kind', 'disputes', 'get', 'resolved', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'ever', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'what', 'want', 'movie', 'respect.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'Brian', 'McCaffrey', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'home', 'Chicago', 'years', 'failed', 'business', 'ventures', 'make', 'sure', ""n't"", 'follow', 'family', 'line', 'becoming', 'Firefighter', 'giving', 'completing', 'Fire', 'Academy', 'placed', 'brother', 'company', 'one', 'toughest', 'brother', 'Steven', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'still', 'bit', 'annoyed', 'not', 'deciding', 'become', 'fireman', 'right', 'bat', 'Chicago', 'firefighters', 'have', 'stout', 'tradition', 'family', 'continuance', 'stubborn', 'old', 'fashioned', 'fire', 'fighting', 'room', 'progressive', 'tactics', 'determined', 'make', 'sure', 'Brian', 'as', 'good', 'quits', 'Brian', 'personally', 'turn', 'Sibling', 'rivalry', 'ensues.Subplots', 'abound', 'learn', 'fire', 'stations', 'are', 'being', 'closed', 'political', 'purposes', 'Brian', 'feelings', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'DeNiro', 'Donald', 'Rimgale', 'Fire', 'Investigator', 'looking', 'Backdraft', 'murders', 'phenomenon', 'fire', 'closed', 'room', 'subside', 'using', 'oxygen', 'explodes', 'when', 'O2', 'reintroduced', 'open', 'door', 'high', 'level', 'politicians', 'businessman', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'method', 'MO', 'DeNiro', 'solid', 'role', 'Arson', 'investigator', 'spouting', 'lines', 'loving', 'fire', 'understanding', 'nature', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'good', 'role', 'character', 'who', 'fire', 'knowing', 'reason', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'killed', 'Baldwin', 'lost', 'usual', 'character', 'somewhat', 'lost', 'trying', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'personal', 'struggle', 'Leigh', ""n't"", 'seem', 'interested', 'role', 'get', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'small', 'role', 'Steven', 'estranged', 'wife', 'great', 'world-weary', 'realism', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'mercilessly', 'put', 'shaved', 'down', 'role', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'best', 'character', 'though', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'playing', 'Ronald', 'Bartel', 'pyro-psycho', 'who', 'locked', 'up', 'mental', 'institution', 'up', 'release', 'occasionally', 'Rimgale', 'repeatedly', 'just', 'how', 'insane', 'still', 'matter', 'what', 'doctors', 'release', 'board', 'thinking', 'Sutherland', 'obviously', 'having', 'most', 'fun', 'part', 'character', 'called', 'help', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'Backdraft', 'murders.The', 'biggest', 'character', 'film', 'though', 'fire', 'astounding', 'Even', 'movie', '11', 'years', 'old', 'up', 'today', 'combination', 'real', 'fire', 'exaggerated', 'computer', 'affects', 'spots', 'visual', 'result', 'frightening', 'actually', 'alive', 'scenes', 'movie', 'good', 'are', 'lot', 'elements', 'squeezed', 'make', 'somewhat', 'even', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'status', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'action', 'emotion', 'special', 'effects']",N/A

The script is filled with contrived dialogue and some incredibly lame and cliched plot turns, but it's the fire footage that makes this film exceed above the rest. The filmmakers initially wanted to go with CGI fire, but the tests done looked so fake that they turned to the real thing. Some amazing scenes are shot in this film that we'll probably never see in a film again due to the fact that CGI has advanced so much over the past decade. The characters are likable and relatable, but the acting is a bit overdone. This isn't the greatest film ever made, but the characters feel real enough to keep a strong emotional connection with the audience, and that's the essence of good filmmaking. Many see Backdraft as the ultimate tribute to firefighters across America, and while the ending of the film sends a tribute, the movie is actually very much centered around the two brothers. Heroism and courage are not central themes of this movie, but it's more about embracing the people around you (not teamwork). The film also features the first collaboration between Ron Howard and Hans Zimmer, in which Zimmer produces one of his best synthesizer based scores. A really good film that finally gets the DVD release it deserves.VIDEO: Owners of the original Backdraft release will rejoice with this all-new digitally remastered transfer. The colors are solid, but I think they picture could have been sharper. There was no hazing or haloing during the fire scenes though, and that was my biggest fear.AUDIO: I didn't own the previous set of the Backdraft, but I'm guessing that this Dolby 5.1 mix is the same mix from the old set. If it is new, then it's a shame. The subwoofer get's a good workout and Zimmer's score is prominent but the dialogue and quality overall is not that rich or spread out.SPECIAL FEATURES: The special features are really short, I went through them in one day. Even though they are short, they are great to watch and are informative. When you play the film you will see a short introduction from Ron in his scruffy beard mode. The best featurette was the ""Igniting The Story"" one in which we go through the script to screen process. We interview some key people about bringing the movie to life, and surprisingly Hans Zimmer gets his own section about the score. I was so happy to see Zimmer in there discussing his work because composers usually never get any screen time in the special features. The other featurettes cover the casting, stunt work, using fire as a character, and then real-life accounts from real firemen. A great set of features with new interviews mixed in with interviews from 1991.BOTTOM LINE: Buy this set whether or not you own the old one or not. While not the best work we've seen from Ron Howard, it's definitely one of those movies that takes you on an exciting and emotional ride. It also has the honor of being the definitive film about fire fighters unlike the most recent and forgettable Ladder 49.",4,"Universal Provides Us With A Much Needed Double-Dip, Backdraft Is One Of Those Films That Deserves A Slot On Your Shelf",1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,3228,"['MOVIE', 'much', 'needed', 're-release', 'Universal', 'incredible', '15th', 'Anniversary', 'set', 'Backdraft', 'Backdraft', 'movie', 'see', 'so', 'often', 'nowadays', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'executed', 'way', 'one', 'best', 'real-life', 'hero', 'tribute', 'films', 'script', 'filled', 'contrived', 'dialogue', 'incredibly', 'lame', 'cliched', 'plot', 'turns', 'fire', 'footage', 'film', 'exceed', 'rest', 'filmmakers', 'initially', 'wanted', 'go', 'CGI', 'fire', 'tests', 'done', 'looked', 'so', 'fake', 'turned', 'real', 'thing', 'amazing', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'film', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'due', 'fact', 'CGI', 'advanced', 'so', 'much', 'past', 'decade', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'relatable', 'acting', 'bit', 'overdone', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'characters', 'feel', 'real', 'enough', 'keep', 'strong', 'emotional', 'connection', 'audience', 'essence', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'Many', 'see', 'Backdraft', 'ultimate', 'tribute', 'firefighters', 'America', 'ending', 'film', 'tribute', 'movie', 'actually', 'very', 'much', 'centered', 'two', 'brothers', 'Heroism', 'courage', 'are', 'not', 'central', 'themes', 'movie', 'more', 'embracing', 'people', 'not', 'teamwork', 'film', 'also', 'first', 'collaboration', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'Zimmer', 'one', 'best', 'synthesizer', 'based', 'scores', 'A', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'finally', 'DVD', 'release', 'Owners', 'original', 'Backdraft', 'release', 'will', 'rejoice', 'all-new', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'transfer', 'colors', 'are', 'solid', 'think', 'picture', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sharper', 'was', 'hazing', 'haloing', 'fire', 'scenes', 'was', 'biggest', 'fear.AUDIO', 'did', ""n't"", 'own', 'previous', 'set', 'Backdraft', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'mix', 'same', 'mix', 'old', 'set', 'new', 'then', 'shame', 'subwoofer', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'prominent', 'dialogue', 'quality', 'overall', 'not', 'rich', 'spread', 'out.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'really', 'short', 'went', 'one', 'day', 'Even', 'are', 'short', 'are', 'great', 'watch', 'are', 'informative', 'When', 'play', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'short', 'introduction', 'Ron', 'scruffy', 'beard', 'mode', 'best', 'featurette', 'was', 'Igniting', 'Story', 'one', 'go', 'script', 'screen', 'process', 'interview', 'key', 'people', 'bringing', 'movie', 'life', 'surprisingly', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'own', 'section', 'score', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'Zimmer', 'discussing', 'work', 'composers', 'usually', 'never', 'get', 'screen', 'time', 'special', 'features', 'other', 'featurettes', 'cover', 'casting', 'stunt', 'work', 'using', 'fire', 'character', 'then', 'real-life', 'accounts', 'real', 'firemen', 'great', 'set', 'features', 'new', 'interviews', 'mixed', 'interviews', '1991.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Buy', 'set', 'not', 'own', 'old', 'one', 'not', 'not', 'best', 'work', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'definitely', 'one', 'movies', 'exciting', 'emotional', 'ride', 'also', 'honor', 'being', 'definitive', 'film', 'fire', 'fighters', 'most', 'recent', 'forgettable', 'Ladder', '49']",N/A

When you visit the ""Backdraft"" soundstage at Universal Studios, they play a few teaser clips from the movie, including the exciting first conflagration sequence when the poor accountant opens his front door.  Realized only too late that they had covered all the good parts of the movie in those few minutes.  Otherwise...William Baldwin should not be placed in front of a camera.  This point cannot be over-emphasized.Kurt Russell has a John Wayne complex, and isn't afraid to show it on the screen.  Where was his acting coach during all this?Blonde girls (Jennifer Jason Leigh and Rebecca DeMornay) provide the otherwise all-male firefighter's world with companionship, offspring, and a chance to make out on the top of a firetruck.  Otherwise, women in this film are just decorative.If fire really does eat, breathe, hate, and ""look"" at you, it can probably apply for resident alien status.  Someone should explain to the knuckleheads in the script department that science can explain how and why fire behaves as it does, and nobody needs to fear the ""flame demons"", who just want to cause death and destruction.Firefighters can't go into dangerous, smoke-filled infernos and still look ""cool"" with their coats undone and their helmets cocked at a rakish angle.  As previously stated, they would be ""cooked"" and also ""asphyxiated"".Given its lack of sophistication and some of the obvious plot twists, this could almost be a kids' film (if it weren't for all the mysterious deaths and bitterness between the main characters and the making out on the top of the firetruck).Every movie has a chance to teach the audience one unfamiliar polysyllabic word.  ""Trychtochlorate""?  Where's the fun in that?  Give me ""Hakuna Matata"" anyday.Post 9/11 problem: The ""powerful"" fireman's funeral procession at the end, as well as early movie dialogue about ""fires in high rises really give me the creeps"" are just too close for comfort to a world that had to watch hundreds of firemen perish in New York City.

They are also brothers whose father died in the line of duty as a firefighter. Never having been on great terms with each other, they now have to work side by side, while Stephen is in charge. And the fires they fight are becoming more and more frequent and more and more dangerous because of the lack of firefighters thanks to the cities cut in manning due to supposed money issues. To top it all off, the fires are beginning to look a lot like an arsonist that is targeting certain individuals within the city.While Backdraft might not be the best thriller out there, it is still a good one. Having not seen this movie since the theaters, I was caught in suspense until the ending because I had no clue who the arsonist was. Sure I had my guesses, but I was never sure. Kurt Russell was amazing as Lt. McCaffrey and as the brother of Brian. I could totally see Kurt being this firefighter for real. And even though Robert Deniro has a small role in this film, it is of course done with perfection. I could've done with a lot more of his character for sure. Willy Baldwin, he was ok. I'd much rather see him act than Stephen Baldwin for sure. Even the fire itself seemed like an actor itself in this movie the way Ron Howard filmed it. With it's creaks and groans and screams and sizzles, it just seems alive. I tell you what though, I'm still not a Donald Sutherland fan...heh. The only time I liked him in this movie was when he was up for parole and Robert Deniro started questioning him. That's when he shined, but other than that, I thought his acting was too goofy. Also, while I said Backdraft is a good thriller, sometimes it just feels a little cookie cutter. The way the investigation of the arsonist was being handled seemed like a straight rip off from Silence of the Lambs. And the bickering between the two brothers seemed kind of like ""As the Firefighters turn..."" And some of the actors just seemed wrong for their parts like Jennifer Jason Leigh and Rebecca De Mornay. They are ok actresses and all, but I don't know, they just didn't seem to fit in here. Maybe it's just me. One thing though that I did truly enjoy was the interactions between the firefighters. They seemed a lot like a family like I would imagine a firefighter unit to be. Joking around with each other when off duty, and working like a single person (most of the time) while on the job. Everyone just seemed to mesh really well with each other when it came to the firefighters.In the end, I would say give this a rent, because I don't really see much second time viewing when it comes to this movie. Good movie though.P.S.- I didn't even know this was a Ron Howard film until I saw his brother Clint Howard playing a Pathologist.

51282,A1FG91CM8221X1,0783223609,Miles D. Moore,"[5, 10]","There are several good things about Ron Howard's &quot;Backdraft&quot;--namely, the truly incredible fire sequences and  solid performances by the great veteran actors Kurt Russell, Robert De Niro and Donald Sutherland. Unfortunately, the movie's flaws weigh far more heavily: the mawkish, cliche-ridden script; the almost total waste of the fine actors Jennifer Jason Leigh, Scott Glenn and Rebecca De Mornay (De Mornay at least has one good, if very short, emotional scene with Russell); and, worst of all, the completely inadequate lead performance of William Baldwin. Almost any reasonably good-looking, well-built actor of Baldwin's age group would have done a better job. (Baldwin's role was originally written for Tom Cruise, who would have given the movie some much-needed star power.) Ron Howard grew up in TV, and his is predominantly a TV sensibility. This works fine in comedy, such as Splash and Parenthood, or in dramas with a well-defined beginning, middle and end, such as Apollo 13. In films which call for the director's shaping hand, however, Howard's limitations become glaring; just whose idea was it, anyway, to have Baldwin and Leigh make love on top of a speeding fire truck?

51284,A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ,0783223609,Nicholas Stix,"[6, 8]","The big-budget movie Backdraft has a talented cast and director, yet it represents a prodigious waste. The movie is a failure because it has a no-talent actor, William Baldwin, in one of the leads; its otherwise gifted director, Ron Howard, had a bad day; and its screenwriter, hack Gregory Widen, never had a good one.The story is about Chicago firemen, particularly two brothers whose father died in the line of duty, when they were youngsters. But it gets mystical: ""A fire eats ... and breathes ... and hates."" Sorry, but fires don't hate; only people hate.Ron Howard must take his share of the blame for this five-alarm bomb. It was up to him to have the screenplay rewritten, or rather, re-written some more, or better yet, burned. He should never have cast Baldwin in any role, and he utterly wasted the talents of Jennifer Jason Leigh, in an idiotic part. And Howard made the picture clumsy and cloying. In the opening scene, Howard seeks to wring tears from the audience by having a fireman's helmet incredibly bounce out of a second story window, landing right at a little boy's feet. And when Howard lets a monster-fire take over in the movie's climactic scene, the pyrotechnics' emotional effect is zero. A good director deftly manipulates viewers' feelings, but in this movie, Howard has all the subtlety of a fire hose hitting you in the face.The reliable Kurt Russell does not disappoint. Scott Glenn is good up to a point; that point is when his role, as written, becomes ludicrous. In spite of having little to work with, Rebecca deMornay does good work as Russell's long-suffering wife. And as the slimy alderman, the late J.T. Walsh is appropriately pompous and phony. Robert DeNiro is also good, although he shows the first signs of certain tics that have since become characteristic of his ""mailing-it-in"" performances. The most enjoyable performance is that of Donald Sutherland, who hams it up as an imprisoned arsonist who helps investigators (a storyline stolen from the novels on which The Silence of the Lambs was based).But the screenplay is some kind of awful. Gregory Widen shovels one subplot on top of another, and they're all so much manure: The wife of the fireman who understands him, yet who seeks to pull out of the marriage, and pull their son away from his father; the youngish man and woman who have been on a romantic collision course for years, yet who inexplicably part ways without even consummating their passion; and the biggest dungheap of all, the story of a string of fatal arsons, which I won't give away.Widen allegedly worked for three years as a fireman. I can only surmise that he did it, with an eye toward cashing in on the experience. So much for the authority of experience. And Widen's Backdraft screenplay was the highpoint of his Hollywood career!And lest I forget, Hans Zimmer's musical score is pompous, insistent and obnoxious, though not quite the monstrosity that his later score for Crimson Tide would be. I guess he was just warming up.",2,This Movie is a Capital Crime,1057968000,"07 12, 2003",2003,3004,"['big-budget', 'movie', 'Backdraft', 'talented', 'cast', 'director', 'prodigious', 'waste', 'movie', 'failure', 'no-talent', 'actor', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'one', 'leads', 'otherwise', 'gifted', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'had', 'bad', 'day', 'screenwriter', 'hack', 'Gregory', 'Widen', 'never', 'had', 'good', 'one.The', 'story', 'Chicago', 'firemen', 'particularly', 'two', 'brothers', 'father', 'died', 'line', 'duty', 'when', 'were', 'youngsters', 'mystical', 'fire', 'eats', 'breathes', 'hates', 'Sorry', 'fires', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'only', 'people', 'hate.Ron', 'Howard', 'must', 'take', 'share', 'blame', 'five-alarm', 'bomb', 'was', 'up', 'have', 'screenplay', 'rewritten', 'rather', 're-written', 'more', 'better', 'yet', 'burned', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'cast', 'Baldwin', 'role', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'talents', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'idiotic', 'part', 'Howard', 'made', 'picture', 'clumsy', 'cloying', 'opening', 'scene', 'Howard', 'wring', 'tears', 'audience', 'having', 'fireman', 'helmet', 'incredibly', 'bounce', 'second', 'story', 'window', 'landing', 'right', 'little', 'boy', 'feet', 'when', 'Howard', 'monster-fire', 'take', 'movie', 'climactic', 'scene', 'pyrotechnics', 'emotional', 'effect', 'zero', 'good', 'director', 'deftly', 'viewers', 'feelings', 'movie', 'Howard', 'subtlety', 'fire', 'hose', 'hitting', 'face.The', 'reliable', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'good', 'up', 'point', 'point', 'when', 'role', 'written', 'ludicrous', 'spite', 'having', 'little', 'work', 'Rebecca', 'deMornay', 'good', 'work', 'Russell', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'slimy', 'alderman', 'late', 'J.T', 'Walsh', 'appropriately', 'pompous', 'phony', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'also', 'good', 'first', 'signs', 'certain', 'tics', 'have', 'become', 'characteristic', 'mailing-it-in', 'performances', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'hams', 'up', 'imprisoned', 'arsonist', 'who', 'investigators', 'storyline', 'stolen', 'novels', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'was', 'based', '.But', 'screenplay', 'kind', 'awful', 'Gregory', 'Widen', 'one', 'subplot', 'top', ""'re"", 'so', 'much', 'manure', 'wife', 'fireman', 'who', 'yet', 'who', 'pull', 'marriage', 'pull', 'son', 'away', 'father', 'youngish', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'romantic', 'collision', 'course', 'years', 'yet', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'part', 'ways', 'even', 'consummating', 'passion', 'biggest', 'dungheap', 'story', 'string', 'fatal', 'arsons', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away.Widen', 'allegedly', 'worked', 'three', 'years', 'fireman', 'can', 'only', 'surmise', 'did', 'eye', 'cashing', 'experience', 'So', 'much', 'authority', 'experience', 'Widen', 'Backdraft', 'screenplay', 'was', 'highpoint', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'lest', 'forget', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'musical', 'score', 'pompous', 'insistent', 'obnoxious', 'not', 'monstrosity', 'later', 'score', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'would', 'be', 'guess', 'was', 'just', 'warming', 'up']",N/A

Without the spectacular (and real) fire scenes, there is no film. No film before or since has had such amazing fire scenes.Being a fire-fighting buff all my life, the one thing I dislike is the unrealistic fire behavior (fire going back inside the walls, like a sort of mythical monster), and how they treat fire like it actually has a mind of its own (listening to Robert DeNiro explain fire behavior to William Baldwin). This is just plain nonsense. Fire does not think, and it does not hate.I thought the cast is actually first-rate. I especially like Kurt Russell. If only they didn't have his character act so foolishly (never wearing his air mask). No real fire-fighter would ever doe this in big fires...nor would they be allowed to). And sometimes, the fire-fighters take too long to advance hoselines (such as in the rescue of the boy in the apartment building).Some of the stuff is done for the sake of the drama (so we can see the brothers working together without the distraction of their fellow fire-fighters -and without their air masks, so we can see their faces close-up).The scene where Brain's fellow rookie fire-fighter friend gets horribly burned is frighteningly all too realistic, and makes you wonder why anyone would want to do this for a living.The hospital scene between the brothers arguing over the disfigured fire-fighter brings their life-long tension to a boiling point!Russell, Baldwin, DeNiro, Scott Glenn, Sutherland and J.T. Walsh are all terrific, as is Jennifer Jason Leigh as the lead female role.If not for the sometimes unrealistic fire behavior, the unrealistic actions of the fire-fighters (especially Kurt Russell), and the nonsense about fire acting like a human being, I would give Backdraft five stars.",4,Fire is the Star...Excellent Cast Does Fine Work,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,1829,"['Everyone', 'who', 'Backdraft', 'so', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'fire', 'spectacular', 'real', 'fire', 'scenes', 'film', 'film', 'had', 'such', 'amazing', 'fire', 'scenes.Being', 'fire-fighting', 'buff', 'life', 'one', 'thing', 'dislike', 'unrealistic', 'fire', 'behavior', 'fire', 'going', 'back', 'walls', 'sort', 'mythical', 'monster', 'how', 'treat', 'fire', 'actually', 'mind', 'own', 'listening', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'explain', 'fire', 'behavior', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'just', 'plain', 'nonsense', 'Fire', 'not', 'think', 'not', 'hate.I', 'thought', 'cast', 'actually', 'first-rate', 'especially', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'character', 'act', 'so', 'foolishly', 'never', 'wearing', 'air', 'mask', 'real', 'fire-fighter', 'would', 'ever', 'doe', 'big', 'fires', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'sometimes', 'fire-fighters', 'take', 'too', 'long', 'advance', 'hoselines', 'such', 'rescue', 'boy', 'apartment', 'building', '.Some', 'stuff', 'done', 'sake', 'drama', 'can', 'see', 'brothers', 'working', 'together', 'distraction', 'fellow', 'fire-fighters', '-and', 'air', 'masks', 'can', 'see', 'close-up', 'scene', 'where', 'Brain', 'fellow', 'rookie', 'fire-fighter', 'friend', 'horribly', 'burned', 'frighteningly', 'too', 'realistic', 'wonder', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'do', 'living.The', 'hospital', 'scene', 'brothers', 'arguing', 'disfigured', 'fire-fighter', 'brings', 'life-long', 'tension', 'boiling', 'point', 'Russell', 'Baldwin', 'DeNiro', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Sutherland', 'J.T', 'Walsh', 'are', 'terrific', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'lead', 'female', 'role.If', 'not', 'sometimes', 'unrealistic', 'fire', 'behavior', 'unrealistic', 'actions', 'fire-fighters', 'especially', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'nonsense', 'fire', 'acting', 'human', 'being', 'would', 'give', 'Backdraft', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

Other reviewers have criticized the Backdraft script and claimed that the only good things in this movie are the fire sequences, but I disagree.  I think the whole thing is good, and the final ""faceoff"" scene with Scott Glenn in the massive fire is classic.

It has several plots, a serial arsonist, economic cutbacks and two brothers working in the shadow of their fireman hero father - klolled in the line of duty.This whole film works well.  DeNiro is excellent as the arson investigator for the fire department.  Russell and Baldwin are also compelling as two brothers - one a career firefighter and the other a novice who turns to the firedepartment only after all other ventures have fizzeled out.Both brothers are complex.  Russell is seperated from his wife - or maybe divorced that part is a little vague.  What has driven them apart is his attitude towards the job and the emotional toll it is taking on his wife who wants to raise her son in a more normal environment.  Baldwin on the other hand, is trying to work under his brother's pressure and the shadow of his dead father.While some actors and actresses have short screen time, DeMornay and Sutherland, they are critical to the overall success of the film.The alderman and mayor wannabe is the perfect sleezy corrupt politician who knows no bounds in getting his politcal career advanced.  The fact that he is getting associates killed is of little seeming consequence.The fire screens were excellent.  You could almost feel the heat of the flames.The funeral cortege through the streets of Chicago are breath-taking and moving.  The camera cutting to the massed ranks of firemen, is breath-taking.

51293,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,0783223609,P. Hardy,"[0, 0]","Introduction: Outside of Jaws, the one of earlier movies I remember seeing as a child, [that I wasn't allowed to watch], was probably Ron Howard's ""Backdraft"". I was curious about fire; How it moved, its color. You name it, I was fascinated by it and the film satisfied my naive curiosity. This might've sparked the want to become a fireman at some point of my life, but the fire is definitely what struck me as the single most compelling thing about the movie. That, and Kurt Russell. Afterward, it sort of vanished into the foreground, becoming nothing but a fond and fuzzy memory until I saw it somewhere on TBS around 2002 or 2004, showing a scene I had never seen before. That scene being Stephen McCaffrey and John Adcox talking to each other outside of a house on the stairs, but its been so long that I'm not even sure that's an actual deleted scene or a fabrication of my own mind. Sad to say, as much as I love the movie, its not one I own on DVD (our VHS is pretty much on its last leg). So when I rented it, I was reminded of how much I enjoyed this film. Sorry for misinformation on my part (despite recently seeing the film, I totally forgot some things).Plot: The film begins somewhere in the 1970's inside of closet where a younger Brian and Stephen McCaffrey are playing around with the firefighter attire (more or less Stephen trying to teach his brother how snap up the jacket right), when their father, Dennis McCaffrey's (Kurt Russell) firetruck --Engine 17-- is called to respond to a fire. Brian finally gets the chance to ride with his father and Axe (Scott Glenn) to the scene, while Stephen remains behind at the station. While in the process of securing the building, Brian's father is caught off guard by gas pipe rupture and is killed in the explosion. Brian, unfortunately, witnesses his father's untimely demise.Fast-forward several years later, a young man named Tim and a older Brian McCaffrey (William Baldwin) have completed terms their in the academy and are ready to be trained as professional firemen, at the Station 13 (if memory serves). Outside of the bar he meets Jennifer Vaitkus (Jennifer Jason Leigh), his ex-girlfriend, before following Tim to the scene of a fire. Like a ghost from fires long past, Stephen McCaffrey steps out of a burning building, the spinning image of their late father. (Something you'd think would bother Brian.) And much to his displeasure, Brian discovers that he now has to train at his brother's station instead of the desired station he wanted. The McCaffrey's relationship at best, a shaky one; The simplest things set the two off at each others throat and sometimes simply forgotten the next day. Naturally, their strained relationship is tested as the two compete against each other and the fire's their station faces, while, inspector Donald Rimgale (Robert De Niro) investigates several backdrafts, trying to determine whether or not if they're arson or accidental.Overview: Despite its age, Backdraft has suffered only a little wear over the span of seventeen years; There are obvious things, like some wardrobes, and the environment itself that keeps the viewer aware of how much the world has changed since then. Hell, the actors themselves let you know how much time has passed. That's hardly anything against it though. But purely on a technical level, Backdraft's special and practical effects still hold up remarkably well against some of today's highly improved effects. Like John Carpenter'sThe Thing, Backdraft may require multiple views to fully appreciate and understand the storylines it throws at you.Unless your the type of viewer who catches onto subplots particularly quick, then you'll have no problem with solving the mystery that surrounds the secondary story of the film; The backdrafts and their seemingly unconnected victims. It throws one possibility at you after another as to who could be causing this (one possibility in particular actually had me praying it wouldn't be a certain character), but the film tends to get distracted with Brain McCaffrey's struggle to prove to his cynical brother that he can be a real fireman and the half-baked romance between himself and Jennifer Vaitkus; The only sex scene in the movie between the two characters, constantly interrupts a particularly gripping search for a fire inside of a high-rise building and ruined the entire scene for me. Thankfully, it doesn't last for long.However, when the film does return to the main focus of the story (the firefighting), things slowly start to click together and make sense. Thus, what was once regarded as a string of disjointed plots, come together in a near-perfect execution that will surprise or confuse you the first time you watch it. When its not throwing the audience into the thick of a fire, Backdraft focuses on the quirky personalities of Station 17 and portrays them more or less as people instead of these mythical beings admired from afar by onlookers and children alike.I'm no expert on a fireman's profession, but from what little I do know, Backdraft is probably the best flick done in respect to their profession and it makes them look good doing it. What surprises me though, is the lukewarm response toward the portrayal of their jobs in this film. Particularly from the so-called firefighters themselves; Some reviewers tear the movie apart over the lack of proper equipment usage or how the fire sequences themselves are portrayed. Its like, for one moment, they completely forget that their watching a movie and feel the need to critique it on the smallest things like its some sort of documentary gone horribly wrong. Now in terms of the dialogue, while some of it is indeed cheesy, I never thought it so terrible or irritating enough to criticize it. If you want to be reminded how bad dialogue can get, go watch a Steven Seagal movie.Performances in the film are particularly strong and some hardly falter ...sometimes (I facepalm everytime I have to watch the slow-mo scenes). As usual, Robert De Niro and Donald Sutherland give excellent performances in their small, but appreciated roles as a Inspector and Arsonist with a history. Kurt Russell and William Baldwin have a great chemistry as brothers --even moreso when they fight--, the two play off of each other quite well. Yet, the only actor that seems to do well on his own is Russell. As the eldest McCaffrey, he is a reckless firefighter, who isn't afraid to take the fire head-on (A trait that plays both to his advantage and disadvantage), yet cannot seem to get his personal life together even if he tried. Kurt Russell plays both the comic and dramatic sides of his character with such ease, its hard not to love Stephen, even when he's being a jerk. (I really can't comment on Russell's performance as the McCaffrey bros. Dad, as he was gone as soon he appeared. He played the 'father' role well, I'll say that much.) Kurt proves time and time again why he's such an excellent actor and this movie is only one example. This isn't to say Baldwin as Brian is horrible, no. He does remarkably well in this movie, but half the time he doesn't seem to be trying in some scenes and Brian was someone I could never connect with properly until the end of the movie. If a scene lingered too long on him, I was sorely tempted to fast forward.Scott Glenn, despite his great performance, is the most under-used actor in the entire movie; which I suppose works to his character's, Axe, advantage in some ways, still it would've been nice to see more of him. Rebecca De Mornay (Risky Business) and the late J.T. Walsh, played Helen McCaffrey and Martin Swayzak with relative ease as well; Walsh played the deplorable character you automatically hated the moment he opened his mouth without trouble. Mornay was a convincing wife and mother, fed up with her husband's reckless behavior. And while I generally liked her character, I never understood why she rejected Stephen when he tried to come back, outside of her own fears and not so much the welfare of their son.Lastly, the score, composed by Hans Zimmer, suited the every scene in the film to a tee. Emotional or action-packed, Zimmer doesn't fail to play on the emotion of a scene and intensify it tenfold. Granted, there was that all too familiar ""Zimmer"" theme that reappears in the filmsThe Rockand Pirates of thePirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl, but that can be easily overlooked. Overall, Backdraft is a excellent Multi-genre Adventure film that never fails to deliver on what it promises the viewer. Performances are strong and the fire sequences are some of the best around. You won't look at fire the same way in a movie again. However, it is among the many ""Love it or Hate it"" films, so depending on your person, you may or may not love this film. I highly recommend it to anyone curious enough to watch despite its flaws. ----- [5 out of 5] - September 24th, 2008",5,"""...Some guys on this job, the fire owns them...the only way to truly kill it

Over the years, people still remembered and talked about those scenes where the flames seemed to reach out to tackle you. But I think the more impressive energy came from the script and the performances. What made those flames all the more fearsome was that they were out to kill characters you really cared about, not the stick figures you normally see in special-effects-ladened films. No,the male characters weren't perfect men, obviously. But they were human beings in a dangerous and noble occupation. There is little more I can add to the performances that hasn't already been said by other reviewers. They are all top-notch (to use a tired but accurate term).  Screenwriter Gregory Widen and, of course, director Ron Howard deserve a lot of credit, as well, for creating a very real drama.And this, I believe, is what makes the movie hold up to this day. Maybe the special effects don't pack the same punch anymore but what movie's special effects from 1991 have? What holds it together, as I mentioned, is the script and the performances. People forget there is an intriguing mystery behind the flames. There's plenty of misdirection but a very logical and satisfying resolution. At certain points, any one character might be the arsonist. And the actors know how to make it look like there is something hidden behind their stoicism. It keeps you guessing, and that's the point of any good mystery.According to Wikipedia, this is the highest-grossing film about firefighters ever made.

It is for the BluRay's actual quality that I give it 5 stars and not necessarily the movie itself.  The movie would get 4 stars from me.VIDEO....I do believe that some work was put into this film's transfer to Blu Ray; at least for the Anniversary Edition.  The colors are brilliant without popping artificially and the color grading, all around, tends to be warm and natural.  There is excellent contrast throughout the entire film and in the many dark and shadow areas, small details are quickly and easily discernible.  At no point did I notice any moving grain or, for that matter, grain even when the movie was paused.  No artifacting in any part of the film and stairstepping which might have shown up in the many wide angle scenes did not occur.  While the cover does not say that the film was completely remastered, I would believe that it was, or, at least, taken from a perfect mother master.  Mbps rate tended to average a high mid-thirties any time I checked.  The fire FXs were the star of the film and the flames seemed as normal and natural as you would expect a real fire to be which is very different than CGI fire fx.  Overall, the video transfer deserves its 5 stars.AUDIO...The DTS HD MA 5.1 audio really kicks your home theater system in the butt.  The audio starts off slower than I expected but when the film jumps to present time, the audio fully utilizes your entire speaker system.  The lossless audio codec brings a greatly transparent dialogue with it and certainly brings the many fire audio foley fx to life.  Discreet channeling is plentiful but usually part of a wholly immersive scene situation.  The fire talks in almost every scene it is in and it talks through different channels bringing along with it your LFE channel to earn the money you paid for it. The directionality of the  Audio also gets a big 5 stars.EXTRAS...I have never seen a disc with this many deleted and alternate scenes.  There are 43 deleted scenes taking up 43 minutes.  These scenes are all in 4:3 aspect ratio and, for many of the scenes, the overhead or underhead boom mics can clearly be seen.  None of these scenes were finished in post production so audio and color grading is on a first pass basis.  The scenes are also not in any particular chronological order and I agree that they all would not have necessarily made for a great extended version.  There were a few that I did think belonged back in the film but that you will have to decide for yourself.Other extras included your typical commentary, docs on how they created the fire fx, real life firemen, how the story came about and the stunt work.  All worthy extras.All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the transfer of a film to Blu Ray and I do hope this review has been of some assistance and help to you in deciding your purchase.Thanks for reading.",5,Backdraft on Blu Ray-Anniversary Edition,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,3028,"['Enough', 'been', 'said', 'regarding', 'film', 'accuracy', 'summaries', 'plot', 'acting', 'other', 'diverse', 'opinions', 'will', 'only', 'review', 'actual', 'quality', 'transfer', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'BluRay', 'actual', 'quality', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'not', 'necessarily', 'movie', 'movie', 'would', 'get', '4', 'stars', 'me.VIDEO', '.I', 'do', 'believe', 'work', 'was', 'put', 'film', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'least', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'colors', 'are', 'brilliant', 'popping', 'artificially', 'color', 'grading', 'around', 'be', 'warm', 'natural', 'excellent', 'contrast', 'entire', 'film', 'many', 'dark', 'shadow', 'areas', 'small', 'details', 'are', 'quickly', 'easily', 'discernible', 'point', 'did', 'notice', 'moving', 'grain', 'matter', 'grain', 'even', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'paused', 'artifacting', 'part', 'film', 'stairstepping', 'might', 'have', 'shown', 'up', 'many', 'wide', 'angle', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'cover', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'completely', 'remastered', 'would', 'believe', 'was', 'least', 'taken', 'perfect', 'mother', 'master', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'tended', 'average', 'high', 'mid-thirties', 'time', 'checked', 'fire', 'FXs', 'were', 'star', 'film', 'flames', 'seemed', 'normal', 'natural', 'would', 'expect', 'real', 'fire', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'CGI', 'fire', 'fx', 'Overall', 'video', 'transfer', '5', 'stars.AUDIO', 'DTS', 'HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'audio', 'really', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'butt', 'audio', 'slower', 'expected', 'when', 'film', 'jumps', 'present', 'time', 'audio', 'fully', 'entire', 'speaker', 'system', 'lossless', 'audio', 'codec', 'greatly', 'transparent', 'dialogue', 'certainly', 'many', 'fire', 'audio', 'foley', 'fx', 'life', 'Discreet', 'channeling', 'plentiful', 'usually', 'part', 'wholly', 'immersive', 'scene', 'situation', 'fire', 'talks', 'almost', 'scene', 'different', 'channels', 'bringing', 'along', 'LFE', 'channel', 'earn', 'money', 'paid', 'directionality', 'Audio', 'also', 'big', '5', 'stars.EXTRAS', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'disc', 'many', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'are', '43', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'taking', 'up', '43', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'are', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'many', 'scenes', 'overhead', 'underhead', 'boom', 'mics', 'can', 'clearly', 'be', 'seen', 'None', 'scenes', 'were', 'finished', 'post', 'production', 'audio', 'color', 'grading', 'first', 'pass', 'basis', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'not', 'particular', 'chronological', 'order', 'agree', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'necessarily', 'made', 'great', 'extended', 'version', 'were', 'few', 'did', 'think', 'belonged', 'back', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'yourself.Other', 'extras', 'included', 'typical', 'commentary', 'docs', 'how', 'created', 'fire', 'fx', 'real', 'life', 'firemen', 'how', 'story', 'came', 'about', 'stunt', 'work', 'worthy', 'extras.All', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'transfer', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'assistance', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A

Scary stuff!Kurt Russell and William Baldwin are firefighter brothers carrying on the legacy of their father who was killed in the line of duty.  Russell is hard nosed, swaggering &quot;Bull&quot; while baby brother Baldwin, a neophyte fireman, is sensitive and simmers with hostility at serving under rough, tough Russell.  Political hanky panky has understaffed the fire department, plus arson is suspected causing an increase in death and injuries of firefighters.The script is so predictable, it is hard to fault the actors; however, I would say Robert de Niro mainly showed up to collect his paycheck. Kurt Russell sparks whatever emotional empathy is available in a fine performance as the bullying, but strangely pure Stephen.  I have a bit of fondness for the Baldwin brothers, so was satisfied with Billy's mostly soulful face throughout.  Donald Sutherland was excellent in a small role as a creepy, soft-spoken former arsonist.  Rebecca de Mornay and Jennifer Jason Leigh were both mainly wasted in their Loyal Ladies in Waiting roles. The pace is excellent, so boredom is never a factor.The &quot;extras&quot; in the DVD are almost nonexistent, but sound and picture are good.

51310,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0783223609,trebe,"[10, 13]","Ron Howard's Backdraft, is a film that centers on the lives of two brothers.  Their father, a Chicago firefighter, was killed on the job when they were young boys.  As adults, the McCaffreys, are both members of fire department.  The elder brother Stephen (Kurt Russell), nicknamed ""Bull"", is a veteran firefighter, who prefers taking on a fire head on.  His younger brother Brian (William Baldwin), is a recent graduate into the department, and though he seeks to serve out of his brother's shadow, he finds himself assigned to Bull's stationhouse.  While Bull is something of a legend within the department, all is not perfect in his life, as estranged from his wife (Rebecca DeMornay), he lives on his father's old dry docked boat.The family drama is set against a subplot, involving a series of suspicious fires that are being investigated by the fire department's arson specialist, Lt. Rimgale (Robert De Niro).  A local Alderman (J.T. Walsh) responsible for budget cutbacks to the department, is pressing Rimgale for answers.  After another clash with his big brother, Brian transfers to Rimgale's arson investigation unit.Once this occurs, the story expands to become more than just a sibling rivalry, as the focus shifts to the investigation of arson and other matters.  De Niro, Baldwin, Walsh and Donald Sutherland, who plays a crazed imprisoned arsonist, then assume more primary roles.  The physics of a backdraft are quite fascinating, and the results spectacular and explosive.  The film does feature some fine special effects and stunts, related to the fire fighting scenes.  The identity of the arsonist, and the reasons for the crimes, may not be very credible, but the film proceeds towards a spectacular and emotional finish.  In the end, it all comes back to the two brothers, and the special bond between firefighters.The film does have its flaws.  Baldwin (28) and Russell (40) are a bit of a mismatch as brothers, with more of an age difference as adults, than it appeared when they were children.  The incident where Brian mistakenly rescues a mannequin is simply ridiculous.  And the attempts to attribute to fire almost metaphysical qualities, may be something only firemen can truly appreciate.  While the film's focus does bounce around a bit between drama, adventure and suspense, overall the presentation is still worth seeing.

And, it has to be said, it looks a lot less impressive on the small screen than it did on the big one. Despite the ostensibly impressive ensemble cast, some of the supporting performances are weak, with Jennifer Jason Leigh proving big time that she really can't play `normal' while Donald Sutherland's Hannibal Firelighter is too Looney Tunes to convince even in his brief screen time, while Baldwin is a considerably less compelling leading man than Russell but gets the lion's share of the screen time anyway. The result is a modestly entertaining but entirely predictable studio picture that plays everything but the conflagrations safe.While many of the plethora of deleted scenes on the two-disc special edition DVD are trims or purely redundant, it seems that a lot of the murder mystery plot and much of Robert De Niro's lazy turn as an arson investigator also hit the cutting room floor, alongside a couple of good fraternal confrontations, but there's little to imply that a better film was left on the cutting room floor.
