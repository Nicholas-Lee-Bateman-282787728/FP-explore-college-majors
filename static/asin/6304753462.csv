It's still quite interesting to hear Fleetwood Mac tell the stories themselves of how the songs that made up their landmark album came together. Why ""Rhiannon"" is included here is beyond me, it wasn't even on that album. The song was released when Buckingham and Nicks joint the group one album prior, so there's some significance. It was Christine that came up with the chunky riff that dominates ""You Make Loving Fun"", but together with Lindsey they made a masterpiece. Between a classic live performance of the song, John and Christine discuss their troubled relationship during the recording. Stevie Nicks reveals that she wrote ""Dreams"" in Sly Stones bed, and how Lindsey always had a way to make her songs sound great, when he was happy with her. The Scottish/Irish folk influenced ""Second Hand News"" was a Buckingham contribution. He reveals that he was listening to the Bee Gee's ""Jive Talking"" at the time he wrote it. Mick Fleetwood offers an interesting little tidbit here; he wasn't the odd man out when it came to dysfunctional relationship. Not only were Lindsey and Stevie & John and Christine on the skid, he was dealing with his best friend sleeping with his wife. They're still friends today though.Mick breaks down the little pieces that make up ""Go Your Own Way"" in the studio to show how it all comes together. Lindsey demonstrates on an acoustic guitar how important the background riff to the song was. Some great stories come out of the discussion of ""Never Going Back Again"". Stevie and Christine always had each other to turn to, John emphasizes how drug use was common place back then, but realizes how bad they were, and the producers tell a hilarious story of mishandled drugs. You've gotta love Lindsey's afro in the video for ""Don't Stop"". The band goes into how the song is connected to President Clinton. The producer states that he felt ""Songbird"" sounded like a concert hall type song, so they booked a concert hall to record it. They set up a piano with flowers and champagne for Christine to play away. They include performance footage in which I can't tell if it's Christine back then or Christine today. She really hasn't aged a bit. The DVD covers the song ""Silver Springs"" which didn't actually appear on the album. The producers said they had to cut it due to time space. There's a live performance of ""The Chain"" from the eighties, circa Lindsey's funny hat days.

Oh and by the way... your former love would be writing publicly about the whole experience! That's pretty much the dilemma the members of the music group, Fleetwood Mac experienced, while making one of the biggest selling rock albums to come out of the 1970s. The history of this album's creation is explored in this episode of Rhino's Classic Albums series documentary, &quot;Fleetwood Mac Rumors&quot;. This is an episode of a series, where performers, writers and producers analyze and talk about a classic album they helped create. In this case we get imput from producer Keith Olsen and all the members of the 'Rumors era' Fleetwood Mac.The documentary is excellent in giving us access to vintage film clips and beautiful stills of the band from the mid to late '70s.More importantly the members of the band give detailed stories and explanations of the real life 'soap opera' behind the album's songs. Some of them were funny (the band diving for a huge bag of fake cocaine, that was droped to the floor) or sad (how Christine McVie could barely talk to her former husband, while making the album).The viewer also gets to follow Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood and Producer, Ken Olsen into the original studio and listen to the recordings being broken down by their musical and vocal tracks. We get to hear the intricacies of Mick Fleetwood's expansive drumming style and how John McVie's bass led each song. The tracks also show what an underated guitarist, Lindsey Buckingham really is and the beauty in the stand alone harmonies of Stevie Knicks &amp; Christine McVie. But my favorite part of the documentary is Christine McVie's  live performance of the tune &quot;Songbird&quot; at the very same auditorium she used to record it over twenty five years ago. Watching her perform this lovely, but heartbreaking song still sends shivers down my spine!

So I am somewhat biased in my opinion. It's easy to see why the Rumours album is considered a classic. Every song on the album is great. The video gets into the creative process behind some of the songwriting and the inspiration for some of their ideas.During the recording of the album there were two couples in the band basically going through the process of breaking up. So there was a lot of tension behind the scenes, as they were putting the album together. When you hear the final product, though, you would never know it. At least they were still able to maintain a certain level of professionalism as musicians and a band.I have not yet purchased one from the series I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. I am a musician myself and I compose and record my own music. I love getting the inside scoop on how these albums are made and the behind the scenes look at the processes of songwriting and recording.

434860,A1GZKHEQWTS4Z5,6304753462,Thomas Moody,"[8, 8]","A spectactular review of Rumours and of the group itself, this ""Classic Albums"" DVD adds to the already sizeable reputation of Fleetwood Mac. The original album alone speaks for itself (certainly one of the top 5 albums of all time) but to now hear all members dissect each song with memories and anecdotes on this DVD made these songs an extremely joyful experience all over again for me.Listening to the group discuss these classic songs now (these are 1997 interviews), one can still see some of the intense emotions that constituted the making of the album. Whether it's Lindsey Buckingham reminiscing about the making of ""Gold Dust Woman"" or Stevie Nicks talking about her emotions during the recording of ""Go Your Own Way"", the viewer gets a true feeling for the emotional committment that each member made during this period. Candid, intense and informal and also with the benefit of 20 years perspective, the producers have added another cornerstone in the ongoing drama that makes this group so popular.All song selections are also looked at from a sound engineers perspective using the original tapes and a multi track sound board. We see how the vocals were broken down and how the instrumentation fit in...basically how each song was built and what influences were used (i.e. Lindsey Buckingham admitting that he ""borrowed"" some ""textures"" from the Bee Gees song ""Jive Talking""). Context of the times during these original recordings is a big part of each song's discussion and the mix of interviews with just the right amount of music makes this DVD a pleasure to watch over and over again.With Fleetwood Mac back out on the road again (for their 2003 Tour minus Christine McVie), the group will undoubtedly get another popularity injection...this DVD shows the group in relatively recent interviews and should show a different generation the ""power"" of Fleetwood Mac.
