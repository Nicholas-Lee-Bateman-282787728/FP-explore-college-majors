I was completely intrigued by the story and the documentary really gave me some frights. When I heard they were bringing the sister documentary Haunting in Connecticut to the big screen, I was hoping Georgia would get a similar treatment. Flash forward and here it is! All in all, Ghost of Georgia is a decent scary movie. The actors were all enjoyable and I knew a lot of them from various TV shows. Even the plot is decent and easy to follow, without any gaping holes to speak of. My issue was that there weren't enough frights! Haunting in Connecticut scared the bejeezus out of me, but Georgia didn't really make a blip on my scare meter. At times it got a tad too preachy when discussing slavery and the events that occurred on the Underground Railroad. It wasn't a great film, but it's worth a rental!

When you watched the film &#34;The Shining,&#34; the 70's version, and the mother is so annoyingly stupid that you beg for her character to die? That's pretty much what the mother is like in this film. Clearly the mother in the fake ghost story the film was based off of was sick of her daughter getting all the camera time and was fine ok-ing her 10 minutes of shame. Seriously, research how many times this family has been on tv saying &#34;We'll never talk about this again to anyone. It was just too frightening.&#34; For people who never wanna talk about it, they sure do talk about it to anyone with a TV show who pays.&#34;Starbuck&#34; has her usual inability to act role, not that acting was required for this film. She's a female version of Keano Reeves. A woodpecker could sit on her face, pecking away at it, and she couldn't emote enough to brush it away.I'm fairly sure the entire budget for this film went to hair extensions, which weren't even good. I've seen better hair extensions on a meth head.The best actor in the film was the dog and I'm a cat person so you know the dog was that good. I hope he got paid the most money. His emoting, line delivery and believability were far superior to the humans. The dog should have gotten hazard pay to be in this film. The poor thing will have a smear on his acting reputation. I for one hope the dog can move passed this mistake and find a good script to work with next time. The humans, well, they never could act to start with.

That's what a good ghost story would have you believe.  With the prevalence of ghost stories these days, you'd wonder how there yet remain a house or a property that's entirely specter-free, but maybe that's just this reviewer over-thinking the proposition.  I've always been a fan of ghost stories when they go to lengths to give the audience a reason to care about the real life characters that populate these kinds of films.  GHOSTS OF GEORGIA works harder than it needed to in that respect, delivering a finished product that's longer than it needed to be but might be just what some folks expect from a budding franchise.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Lisa Wyrick (a glowing Abigail Spencer) has a problem.  A real problem.  She's grown up with the ability to see ghosts.  Real ghosts.  With medication, she's been able to keep it under control, but a move to a new country home in historic Georgia - along with her husband Andy (Chad Michael Murray), her daughter Heidi (Emily Alyn Lind), and her sister Joyce (Katee Sackhoff) - brings Lisa closer and closer to the realization that Heidi is starting to experience visions all of her own.  As it turns out, their property is possessed by a chilling secret linked back to the Underground Railroad during the Civil War; what started out as an attempt to help runaway slaves morphed into experiments in terror.  All of this serves to put the family on a collision course with a spirit powerful enough to destroy the lives of the living.Horror movies come and go.  As GHOSTS OF GEORGIA testifies, there's a cottage industry that could be built up around almost any property.  (This is a thematic sequel-of-sorts to 2009's THE HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT.)  Having never seen the original, I couldn't say how well this experience relates to the first, but, as chillers go, this one is pretty benign.  The script by David Coggeshall is bloated with moments that largely feel repetitive - lots of flashes of ghosts walking through fields, lots of photo-play with darks and lights, plenty of close-ups on scared or terrified faces, etc. - when the previous scene already established a credibly spooky atmosphere.  At 101 minutes, this feels at times like 1,001 minutes, and that effect rarely serves a scary movie well.I did admire how well Coggeshall plundered elements from history (the Underground Railroad, the harsh reality of the Civil War, etc.) to give the supernatural elements greater depth.  Lesser writers probably would've merely created a freakishly diabolical madman and made him a ghost, but GHOSTS OF GEORGIA plays cleverly back into an earlier era - a different set of social circumstances - and, thus, the picture is strengthened.  There's even a lynching - maybe even two, depending upon how you interpret the story - thrown in for good theatrical measure, and it's played ingeniously against the visual symbolism of a child's swing.  More of that would've elevated this film to a higher level; but, as happens too often these days, the climax is heavily fraught with normally sensible characters behaving senselessly, killing much of the impact of what they discover.Not bad, but not perfect.  Might there be a third HAUNTING in the offing?  Stranger things have happened.THE HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT 2: GHOSTS OF GEORGIA is produced by Gold Circle Films and Lionsgate.  DVD distribution is being handled through Lionsgate.  The film is viewable in full widescreen presentation.  As for the technical specifications, it looks and sounds terrific.  Also, the disc is replete with special features, including an audio commentary with the director, writer, and director; a 10-minute documentary focusing on the real Wyrick family; deleted scenes (with optional commentary); a few associated theatrical trailers; and a couple of minutes of outtakes - mostly funny flubs but one unfortunate bee-stinging.  Ouch!RECOMMENDED.  It's a bit too long for my tastes - some of the family moments could've been trimmed because so many of the scenes simply restate thematically what we've already been told - but GHOSTS OF GEORGIA serves up some modest, effective CGI-light scares (always a plus in my book).  There's plenty of camera trickery to match up against the things that go bump in the night.  However, a tighter pace would've been appreciated because that would've delivered the frights a bit faster.  It's a respectable attempt toward incorporating a human-interest drama into a light scare-fest (why was this thing rated R?), but it's possibly a bit too much for younger viewers.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Lionsgate provided me with an advance DVD copy of THE HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT 2: GHOSTS OF GEORGIA for the expressed purposes of completing

1623337,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00B96TGQS,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[12, 15]","First off, let's just get something out of the way. ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" never had a chance to succeed. With a paradoxical title like that, audiences are given a red flag immediately. If the producers of a movie can't decide on a better name for a film, then how could they make bigger decisions during production? Just pick a name! Was ""Ghosts of Georgia"" any more generic than ""The Haunting in Connecticut?"" The reason I sound so frustrated is because it deserves better.The Wyrick family moves into a country house in Georgia. Their daughter, Heidi, soon begins telling her parents she talks to a man who warns they're in danger. Upon investigating, they find out their house is located on land once owned by a stationmaster of the Underground Railroad. The souls of the slaves are restless and begin haunting the family for unknown reasons.Director Tom Elkins and writer David Coggeshall put together quite an impressive ghost story with ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia."" While ""based on a true story,"" it's obvious some creative license is utilized to spice things up. However, there are some genuinely frightening moments that will resonate with viewers. Let's just say Elkins and Coggeshall know our innermost fears and exploits them.The entire cast of ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" put forth their best efforts and embrace their individual characters. You can tell they took the material seriously and ran with it. Chad Michael Murray plays the father of the family. Abigail Spencer takes on the role of the mother. Katee Sackhoff portrays Spencer's free-spirited sister who comes to live with them. Emily Alyn Lind is perfect in as the little girl Heidi. She embraces the role straight-faced with an air of authentic innocence.The audio and video high definition transfers for the film are good. The picture is clean and the colors all breathe life into the visual experience. My only problem with how the movie looks are the ""dimensional"" sequences and the way they're shot, edited, and colored. They give it a cheap, straight-to-DVD feel that is distracting. The 5.1 surround sound mix provides all the immersive bumps, slams, jarring musical blares, screams, and haunting whispers horror fans have come to expect from these types of films.Special features for ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" will satisfy consumers. Audio commentary is provided by Director Tom Elkins, Writer David Coggeshall, and Co-Producer Brad Kessell. There's a 10-minute featurette in which we meet the real members of the Wyrick family and hear their experiences firsthand. Deleted scenes with optional commentary, outtakes, and a theatrical trailer are included as well.""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" is a good supernatural tale that should have been released in theaters like its predecessor. There are nice twists to the story, the acting is good, and the scares are genuinely creepy. Maybe it's selfish, but I was looking forward to seeing the movie on a big screen in a quiet atmosphere where it could have my full attention. Seeing the movie at home will provide genre fans with a satisfying experience, too.",4,"Blu-ray Review: ""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia""",1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,3208,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'just', 'get', 'something', 'way', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', '2', 'Ghosts', 'Georgia', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'succeed', 'paradoxical', 'title', 'audiences', 'are', 'given', 'red', 'flag', 'immediately', 'producers', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'better', 'name', 'film', 'then', 'how', 'could', 'make', 'bigger', 'decisions', 'production', 'Just', 'pick', 'name', 'Was', 'Ghosts', 'Georgia', 'more', 'generic', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'reason', 'sound', 'so', 'frustrated', 'better.The', 'Wyrick', 'family', 'country', 'house', 'Georgia', 'daughter', 'Heidi', 'soon', 'telling', 'parents', 'man', 'who', ""'re"", 'danger', 'investigating', 'find', 'out', 'house', 'located', 'land', 'once', 'owned', 'stationmaster', 'Underground', 'Railroad', 'souls', 'slaves', 'are', 'restless', 'begin', 'haunting', 'family', 'unknown', 'reasons.Director', 'Tom', 'Elkins', 'writer', 'David', 'Coggeshall', 'put', 'together', 'quite', 'impressive', 'ghost', 'story', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', '2', 'Ghosts', 'Georgia', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'obvious', 'creative', 'license', 'utilized', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'However', 'are', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'moments', 'will', 'resonate', 'viewers', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Elkins', 'Coggeshall', 'know', 'innermost', 'fears', 'them.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', '2', 'Ghosts', 'Georgia', 'put', 'best', 'efforts', 'embrace', 'individual', 'characters', 'can', 'tell', 'took', 'material', 'seriously', 'ran', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'father', 'family', 'Abigail', 'Spencer', 'role', 'mother', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'Spencer', 'free-spirited', 'sister', 'who', 'live', 'Emily', 'Alyn', 'Lind', 'perfect', 'little', 'girl', 'Heidi', 'role', 'straight-faced', 'air', 'authentic', 'innocence.The', 'audio', 'video', 'high', 'definition', 'transfers', 'film', 'are', 'good', 'picture', 'clean', 'colors', 'breathe', 'life', 'visual', 'experience', 'only', 'problem', 'how', 'movie', 'looks', 'are', 'dimensional', 'sequences', 'way', ""'re"", 'shot', 'edited', 'colored', 'give', 'cheap', 'straight-to-DVD', 'feel', 'distracting', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'mix', 'immersive', 'bumps', 'slams', 'jarring', 'musical', 'blares', 'screams', 'haunting', 'whispers', 'horror', 'fans', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'types', 'films.Special', 'features', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', '2', 'Ghosts', 'Georgia', 'will', 'satisfy', 'consumers', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Director', 'Tom', 'Elkins', 'Writer', 'David', 'Coggeshall', 'Co-Producer', 'Brad', 'Kessell', '10-minute', 'featurette', 'meet', 'real', 'members', 'Wyrick', 'family', 'hear', 'experiences', 'firsthand', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'outtakes', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'are', 'included', 'well', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', '2', 'Ghosts', 'Georgia', 'good', 'supernatural', 'tale', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'theaters', 'predecessor', 'are', 'nice', 'twists', 'story', 'acting', 'good', 'scares', 'are', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'Maybe', 'selfish', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'quiet', 'atmosphere', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'full', 'attention', 'Seeing', 'movie', 'home', 'will', 'provide', 'genre', 'fans', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'too']",The Haunting In Connecticut 2: Ghosts Of Georgia Digital

1623341,A3NISFVX8GR31S,B00B96TGQS,Gloria J. Sanders,"[1, 1]","I will start out by saying, this is no sequel to The Haunting in Connecticut other than it is another story of haunting ""based on a true story"" and I believe involves some of the Hollywood folks who did the first. It takes place in Georgia and has nothing to do with the family in the first movie, nor to any of the paranormal investigators from the first movie, that I am aware of. It is fairly well acted and has good scares. The extras on the DVD with the real family was interesting. Movies with kids interacting with the ghosts just seem creepier to me. MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS........... Although the entire female family are clairvoyants, only one sister embraces it (or so she claims, but she is fairly terrified by most things she sees, though I guess I would be also). We see the mother attempt to medicate her ability to see the spirit world away, as did her mother we are told at some point.

Not only are there three major ghost hunting series on TV now but shows about haunting and paranormal experiences have flooded the airwaves. While ghosts have been the subject of numerous movies it's rare that these stories are done justice. With the release of A HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT a few years ago that changed. Enough to warrant a sequel which has now ended up going straight to DVD.A HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT 2: GHOSTS OF GEORGIA has nothing to do with Connecticut nor the ghosts found in that first film. Apparently the producers wanted to start a franchise and felt that A HAUNTING IN GEORGIA  would not have been a clear enough title for fans of the first film.

I doubt all 50 states would have been hit though.Once again ""based on a true story"", we have the Wyrick family who have just moved into a new house with a large acreage for their young daughter to roam around in. Bought cheap (never a good sign) and empty for some time now things begin to happen right away. Heidi, the little girl, starts talking to a man she calls Mr. Gordy and he's started telling her things about the house and property. This might seem like an imaginary play pal except for the history of Heidi's mother.Lisa Wyrick is trying to get over a problem she's had for years, one where she hears voices in her head and sees things that aren't there. On medication she's rejected what her mother and her sister believed, that their family is gifted with ""the veil"". This gift gives them the power to see things others don't which would of course include dead people. Sister Joyce has moved onto the property with Lisa, Lisa's husband Andy and Heidi, living in an old trailer near the house. While Heidi's mother tries to tell Heidi there's nothing there, Joyce explains what ""the veil"" is to her.Mr. Gordy at first seems to be a benevolent ghosts going so far as to let the family know where some old money was buried. But when they begin looking into his past they're not quite sure. Further delving reveals that Mr. Gordy's grandfather was a taxidermist who used the property to aid slaves heading north, a part of the famous Underground Railroad. Heidi and Lisa both begin to see the images of slaves on the property with Heidi feeling nothing is wrong but Lisa still trying to ignore all she sees.When things begin to go bad, including the disappearance of Heidi only to be found in a strange pit, they bring in a local preacher to help rid her of what they think is a possession. But there is more going on on this property than anyone realizes and a history that is far darker than anyone knows or could imagine.That dark back story makes this movie more interesting than most. Many will toss this movie off as just another straight to DVD feature that doesn't stand on its own merits but I would beg to differ. The story was well thought out and the reveal is one most won't see coming. Extras on the DVD include talks with the original family, Heidi now grown up, talking about what they experienced while living there.There are a few jump scenes in the film but this movie doesn't play on the scare factor and relies more on the story to make its points. It offers some nice entertainment value and will be a movie that makes a nice starter point for people wanting to discuss ghosts and whether they actually exist or not. The production values are extremely well done unlike some horror films where night scenes are so dark as to not be able to see anything. In this production everything from the camera work to the acting is well done.My guess is there won't be another HAUTING IN film made. I would think that this film would be passed over in light of other major releases coming out at the same time. But if you're looking for something a little creepy that offers and interesting story along with a few scares then you might want to give this one a try.",3,BACKWOODS GHOSTS,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,4036,"['everything', 'ghostly', 'become', 'part', 'today', 'culture', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'there', 'three', 'major', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'series', 'TV', 'now', 'haunting', 'paranormal', 'experiences', 'have', 'flooded', 'airwaves', 'ghosts', 'have', 'been', 'subject', 'numerous', 'movies', 'rare', 'stories', 'are', 'done', 'justice', 'release', 'A', 'HAUNTING', 'IN', 'CONNECTICUT', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'changed', 'Enough', 'warrant', 'sequel', 'now', 'ended', 'up', 'going', 'straight', 'DVD.A', 'HAUNTING', 'IN', 'CONNECTICUT', '2', 'GHOSTS', 'OF', 'GEORGIA', 'nothing', 'do', 'Connecticut', 'ghosts', 'found', 'first', 'film', 'Apparently', 'producers', 'wanted', 'start', 'franchise', 'felt', 'A', 'HAUNTING', 'IN', 'GEORGIA', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'clear', 'enough', 'title', 'fans', 'first', 'film', 'think', 'viewers', 'are', 'smart', 'enough', 'figure', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'new', 'state', 'were', 'added', 'film', 'doubt', '50', 'states', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hit', 'though.Once', 'again', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'have', 'Wyrick', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'moved', 'new', 'house', 'large', 'acreage', 'young', 'daughter', 'roam', 'around', 'Bought', 'cheap', 'never', 'good', 'sign', 'time', 'now', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'right', 'away', 'Heidi', 'little', 'girl', 'talking', 'man', 'Mr.', 'Gordy', 'started', 'telling', 'things', 'house', 'property', 'might', 'seem', 'imaginary', 'play', 'pal', 'history', 'Heidi', 'mother.Lisa', 'Wyrick', 'trying', 'get', 'problem', 'had', 'years', 'one', 'where', 'voices', 'head', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'medication', 'rejected', 'what', 'mother', 'sister', 'believed', 'family', 'gifted', 'veil', 'gift', 'power', 'see', 'things', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'would', 'course', 'include', 'dead', 'people', 'Sister', 'Joyce', 'moved', 'property', 'Lisa', 'Lisa', 'husband', 'Andy', 'Heidi', 'living', 'old', 'trailer', 'house', 'Heidi', 'mother', 'tell', 'Heidi', 'nothing', 'there', 'Joyce', 'what', 'veil', 'her.Mr', 'Gordy', 'first', 'be', 'benevolent', 'ghosts', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'let', 'family', 'know', 'where', 'old', 'money', 'was', 'buried', 'when', 'begin', 'looking', 'past', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'Further', 'delving', 'reveals', 'Mr.', 'Gordy', 'grandfather', 'was', 'taxidermist', 'who', 'used', 'property', 'aid', 'slaves', 'heading', 'north', 'part', 'famous', 'Underground', 'Railroad', 'Heidi', 'Lisa', 'begin', 'see', 'images', 'slaves', 'property', 'Heidi', 'feeling', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Lisa', 'still', 'trying', 'ignore', 'sees.When', 'things', 'begin', 'go', 'bad', 'including', 'disappearance', 'Heidi', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'strange', 'pit', 'bring', 'local', 'preacher', 'help', 'rid', 'what', 'think', 'possession', 'more', 'going', 'property', 'anyone', 'realizes', 'history', 'far', 'darker', 'anyone', 'could', 'imagine.That', 'dark', 'back', 'story', 'movie', 'more', 'interesting', 'most', 'Many', 'will', 'toss', 'movie', 'off', 'as', 'just', 'straight', 'DVD', 'feature', ""n't"", 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'would', 'beg', 'differ', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'reveal', 'one', 'most', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'Extras', 'DVD', 'include', 'talks', 'original', 'family', 'Heidi', 'now', 'up', 'talking', 'what', 'experienced', 'living', 'are', 'few', 'jump', 'scenes', 'film', 'movie', ""n't"", 'play', 'scare', 'factor', 'relies', 'more', 'story', 'make', 'points', 'nice', 'entertainment', 'value', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'nice', 'starter', 'point', 'people', 'wanting', 'discuss', 'ghosts', 'actually', 'exist', 'not', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'horror', 'films', 'where', 'night', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'dark', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'anything', 'production', 'everything', 'camera', 'work', 'acting', 'well', 'done.My', 'guess', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'HAUTING', 'IN', 'film', 'made', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'passed', 'light', 'other', 'major', 'releases', 'coming', 'out', 'same', 'time', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'creepy', 'offers', 'interesting', 'story', 'few', 'scares', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'one', 'try']",The Haunting In Connecticut 2: Ghosts Of Georgia Digital

1623371,A2AK7ZFKW08HID,B00B96TGQS,movielover,"[1, 2]","The Haunting in Connecticut 2: The Ghosts of Georgia has earned a pretty bad reputation due to two things: First is the title, having a movie that is called Haunting in Connecticut and having it take place in Georgia wasn't a very smart choice, they should of went with what they were going to originally name it and that was The Haunting in Georgia. Secondly is that though it is played off as a sequel, it is not a direct sequel to the first film due to the fact that there is no connection between the two films, except for the fact they are both based on true stories. If you can look past these 2 problems this is actually a very entertaining movie.Ghosts of Georgia follows the story of a young family who move into their new home in the backwoods of Georgia. Soon after,  the couples young daughter begins to see the ghost of the previous owner Mr. Gordy. The girls mother doesn't believe her, even though she herself has the same gift, but chooses to take medication to try an block it. It doesn't take long for the young girls vision intensifies and she begins to see more and more ghosts.What makes this movie stand out is that there is quite a mystery throughout the movie, that keeps you guessing. Is Mr. Gordy the devil in disguise, what happened to the stationmaster and why. The mystery really helps to drive the story and it keeps you drawn into the movie.Now onto the based on a true story part. This movie is based on the experiences of the Wyrick family. Like the first Haunting in Connecticut movie this movie does stretch the truth quite a lot, but that is Hollywood and that is what makes for good horror movies. For any horror movie reality has to be stretched in some way shape or form, and to put this movie down do to that fact or the fact that the title was a bad choice just isn't really fair.If you love a good ghost story, and this flick had plenty of ghosts and scares, this is right up your alley. It is definitely worth your time to check this one out, even if you just rent it, but myself, I am glad I bought it, because I have already watched it numerous times.And by the way there is no nudity or sex in this film, and hardly any gore, now that might turn away some horror fans, but I promise that you won't even pay attention to that, because you will be so drawn in to the story.

The film takes its story from the Discovery Channel episode of a Haunting In Georgia, which, on the DVD was the flip-side of A Haunting in Connecticut. To add some confusion, the title of this film does not take place in Connecticut, and barely even mentions that they are in Georgia, but at this point is just riding the coattails of the ""success"" of A Haunting in Connecticut. Now why a low budget documentary on the Discovery Channel gets the story right, while this movie (and the Connecticut one) seem to make wild nonsense out it into a story that has no relation to reality.I am not a firm ghost believer, but I like a good ghost story. This movie, tells the story of a family moving into a new house, and suddenly are foisted with all these incidents. Of course the mom/wife is on medicate for her mental illness and their daughter, Emily, starts seeing things. They of course believe that maybe she has inherited this illness. Sooner than later, everyone is seeing ghosts.To put it simply, they see ghosts. The ghosts dont seem hostile. They just appear most of the time. Play a few bars on the piano. Change the radio station. Make noises in the woods. What is disturbing about this film is not so much the ghosts, but the film seems to want to confuse the audience by having us guess whether what we see is something of a mental illness (ala hallucinations) or whether they are really ghosts haunting them.There seems to be no reason for their appearance. And some of the instances do not make any sense what so ever. I would watch the Discovery Channel documentary before watching this as I thought it was much scarier, and it made more sense - both as a story and in reality.

1623388,A387BD735MI50R,B00B96TGQS,R. Schultz,"[1, 2]","There are just too many ghosts here. There's a manifestation a minute. Ghosts are running around all over, lessening the impact of any particular vision.This haunting takes place exclusively in Georgia. If you are curious why the main movie title is then ""A Haunting in Connecticut"" - it seems to be because this is a continuation of a series ""based on true stories"" whose first entry was indeed set in Connecticut. That first haunting also was plagued by too many sightings.In each case, the producers of these films take a real family's report of having been haunted in their new homes, and riff on those experiences. They cobble together a back story that explains the sufferings that have been causing the dead to reappear, shrieking for justice or simple acknowledgment.Here the impulse that drove this host of ghosts to appear centers around some of the history of the pre-Civil War days. There were horrors suffered aplenty then, but this movie focuses on a uniquely horrible (and hopefully fictional) fate suffered by some of those seeking freedom through the Underground Railroad. It's an interesting idea about how far dementia carried one man. But again, the idea gets swamped by the sheer numbers of ghosts who appear to re-play the drama of the good, the bad, and the downright ugly.There are also lots of extras on this DVD. There's a director's/writer's commentary. Then there's an interview with the family whose experiences inspired this story. The female members of this family believe their sensitivity to the spirit-world stems from the fact that they were born with a ""veil."" That's the caul, part of the amniotic sac, that occasionally comes along with the baby, and that used to be widely believed to predict an ability to communicate with the nether regions.There is some interesting history and atmospherics here. But to make the tale even remotely believable, and therefore scary, it should have been handled with much more restraint and subtlety.",3,A Gallimaufry of Ghosts,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1973,"['are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'ghosts', 'here', 'manifestation', 'minute', 'Ghosts', 'are', 'running', 'around', 'lessening', 'impact', 'particular', 'vision.This', 'haunting', 'place', 'exclusively', 'Georgia', 'are', 'curious', 'why', 'main', 'movie', 'title', 'then', 'A', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'be', 'continuation', 'series', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'first', 'entry', 'was', 'indeed', 'set', 'Connecticut', 'first', 'haunting', 'also', 'was', 'plagued', 'too', 'many', 'sightings.In', 'case', 'producers', 'films', 'take', 'real', 'family', 'report', 'having', 'been', 'haunted', 'new', 'homes', 'riff', 'experiences', 'cobble', 'together', 'back', 'story', 'sufferings', 'have', 'been', 'causing', 'dead', 'reappear', 'shrieking', 'justice', 'simple', 'acknowledgment.Here', 'impulse', 'drove', 'host', 'ghosts', 'appear', 'centers', 'history', 'pre-Civil', 'War', 'days', 'were', 'horrors', 'suffered', 'aplenty', 'then', 'movie', 'uniquely', 'horrible', 'hopefully', 'fictional', 'fate', 'suffered', 'seeking', 'freedom', 'Underground', 'Railroad', 'interesting', 'idea', 'how', 'far', 'carried', 'one', 'man', 'again', 'idea', 'swamped', 'sheer', 'numbers', 'ghosts', 'who', 'appear', 're-play', 'drama', 'good', 'bad', 'downright', 'are', 'also', 'lots', 'extras', 'DVD', ""director's/writer"", 'commentary', 'Then', 'interview', 'family', 'experiences', 'inspired', 'story', 'female', 'members', 'family', 'believe', 'sensitivity', 'spirit-world', 'stems', 'fact', 'were', 'born', 'veil', 'caul', 'part', 'amniotic', 'sac', 'occasionally', 'baby', 'used', 'be', 'widely', 'believed', 'predict', 'ability', 'communicate', 'nether', 'regions.There', 'interesting', 'history', 'atmospherics', 'here', 'make', 'tale', 'even', 'remotely', 'believable', 'therefore', 'scary', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'much', 'more', 'restraint', 'subtlety']",The Haunting In Connecticut 2: Ghosts Of Georgia Digital

I find it challenging to even rate this movie at this time.I gave ""Mama"" (2013) a 4-star rating, so how can I give this movie a similar rating since ""Mama"" (2013) is so genuinely scary that it outstrips the ""Ghosts of Georgia"" by at least 10 times (subjectively speaking)?OK, I'll give 5/5 stars to all the major characters of this movie and their acting skills + a 5/5 rating to the finale, the closing scenes.Everything else in between the first and last scenes is passable for a basic horror movie that doesn't give too many surprises, and hence, resulting in dilution of my final rating.The art cover of the DVD and the movie posters have no relevance to any scene in the movie.I've unanswered questions after watching this movie:Who killed the evil station master back in ancient times? The ghosts OR the Ku Klux Klan (KKK)? Did the KKK kill him first, followed by the black ghosts came after his lingered haunted soul in a replay of the same death scene?Note on a movie blooper:A Protestant pastor is NOT a [Catholic] ""priest"". The couple was told to see a ""priest"". A Prot pastor is but a layman with NO sacramental powers and isn't even in the Church to begin with, thus drawing no powers from the Treasury of Merits of the eternal Church. He apes the externals of the Church (ie. the purple stole over his shoulders, etc.) but owns NO ordained powers of the Apostolic Catholic sacramental system. That's why the violent hauntings continued even after his one-time ""prayers"".Say you've a serious illness, instead of seeing a professional specialist (in this case, a real, validly ordained Catholic priest), you go instead to a street preacher who merely claims to heal by the laying of hands or a street vendor selling ""wonder healing oils"". What kind of results would you expect then? Common sense ought to prevail. When it comes to earthly physical ailments, people can often tell a real doctor from a quack, but curiously enough, when it comes to spiritual matters, somehow, most people prefer quack ""doctors"" whose personal and organizational histories are at best questionable.This review may be edited at a later time, if I've the time!Recommended viewing:MamaThe Possession [DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet]The Exorcist: Director's Cut (Extended Edition)The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen)",3,"Over-rated Movie: ""Ghosts of Georgia"" is the appropriate title, Connecticut isn't featured",1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,2468,"['super', 'sexy', 'actress', 'Abigail', 'Spencer', 'superb', 'performance', 'baby-face', 'child', 'prodigy', 'actress', 'Emily', 'Lind', 'what', 'else', 'nice', 'movie', 'find', 'challenging', 'even', 'rate', 'movie', 'time.I', 'gave', 'Mama', '2013', '4-star', 'rating', 'how', 'can', 'give', 'movie', 'similar', 'rating', 'Mama', '2013', 'so', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'Ghosts', 'Georgia', 'least', '10', 'times', 'subjectively', 'speaking', 'OK', ""'ll"", 'give', '5/5', 'stars', 'major', 'characters', 'movie', 'acting', 'skills', '+', '5/5', 'rating', 'finale', 'closing', 'scenes.Everything', 'else', 'first', 'last', 'scenes', 'passable', 'basic', 'horror', 'movie', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'many', 'surprises', 'hence', 'resulting', 'dilution', 'final', 'rating.The', 'art', 'cover', 'DVD', 'movie', 'posters', 'have', 'relevance', 'scene', 'movie.I', ""'ve"", 'unanswered', 'questions', 'watching', 'movie', 'Who', 'killed', 'evil', 'station', 'master', 'back', 'ancient', 'times', 'ghosts', 'OR', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'KKK', 'Did', 'KKK', 'kill', 'first', 'followed', 'black', 'ghosts', 'came', 'lingered', 'haunted', 'soul', 'replay', 'same', 'death', 'scene', 'Note', 'movie', 'blooper', 'Protestant', 'pastor', 'NOT', '[', 'Catholic', ']', 'priest', 'couple', 'was', 'told', 'see', 'priest', 'Prot', 'pastor', 'layman', 'NO', 'sacramental', 'powers', ""n't"", 'even', 'Church', 'begin', 'thus', 'drawing', 'powers', 'Treasury', 'Merits', 'eternal', 'Church', 'externals', 'Church', 'ie', 'purple', 'stole', 'shoulders', 'etc', 'NO', 'ordained', 'powers', 'Apostolic', 'Catholic', 'sacramental', 'system', 'why', 'violent', 'hauntings', 'continued', 'even', 'one-time', 'prayers', '.Say', ""'ve"", 'serious', 'illness', 'instead', 'seeing', 'professional', 'specialist', 'case', 'real', 'validly', 'ordained', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'go', 'instead', 'street', 'preacher', 'who', 'merely', 'heal', 'laying', 'hands', 'street', 'vendor', 'selling', 'wonder', 'healing', 'oils', 'What', 'kind', 'results', 'would', 'expect', 'then', 'Common', 'sense', 'ought', 'prevail', 'When', 'earthly', 'physical', 'ailments', 'people', 'can', 'often', 'tell', 'real', 'doctor', 'quack', 'curiously', 'enough', 'when', 'spiritual', 'matters', 'somehow', 'most', 'people', 'prefer', 'quack', 'doctors', 'personal', 'organizational', 'histories', 'are', 'best', 'questionable.This', 'review', 'may', 'be', 'edited', 'later', 'time', ""'ve"", 'time', 'Recommended', 'viewing', 'MamaThe', 'Possession', '[', 'DVD', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', '+', 'UltraViolet', ']', 'Exorcist', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'Exorcist', 'Version', ""'ve"", 'Never', 'Seen']",The Haunting In Connecticut 2: Ghosts Of Georgia Digital

I'm not sure what this film had to do with the first one as Connecticut seems to be more connected to King Arthur's Court than Georgia. The script was predictable, the acting was hit and miss. Abigail Spencer has done better.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Relatively kid safe.

1623397,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00B96TGQS,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","""The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" follows a family's nightmarish descent into a centuries-old Southern hell.  When Andy Wyrick (Chad Michael Murray) moves with wife Lisa (Abigail Spencer) and daughter Heidi (Emily Alyn Lind) to a historic home in Georgia, they quickly discover they are not alone.  Joined by Lisa's free-spirited sister, Joyce (Katee Sackhoff), they soon come face to face with a chilling mystery.  Heidi sees visions of the Underground Railroad and it happens that the new family home is located in a part of the state where lots of runaway slaves were killed.Cicely Tyson pops up for a few minutes as a old blind woman issuing creepy, ominous portents, and there are rotting corpses, gruesome special effects, and eerie old codgers for atmosphere, but the film depends mostly on cheap scares and ghost-tale cliches. Given that this film bears no relation to ""The Haunting in Connecticut,"" the title is the dumbest of the year.Bonus extras include audio commentary with director, writer, and producer; the featurette ""Seeing Ghosts: The True Story of the Wyricks;"" deleted scenes; and bloopers.",2,Rehash of a plot fails to catch fire,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1129,"['Haunting', 'Connecticut', '2', 'Ghosts', 'Georgia', 'family', 'nightmarish', 'descent', 'centuries-old', 'Southern', 'hell', 'When', 'Andy', 'Wyrick', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'wife', 'Lisa', 'Abigail', 'Spencer', 'daughter', 'Heidi', 'Emily', 'Alyn', 'Lind', 'historic', 'home', 'Georgia', 'quickly', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'Joined', 'Lisa', 'free-spirited', 'sister', 'Joyce', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'soon', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'chilling', 'mystery', 'Heidi', 'visions', 'Underground', 'Railroad', 'new', 'family', 'home', 'located', 'part', 'state', 'where', 'lots', 'runaway', 'slaves', 'were', 'killed.Cicely', 'Tyson', 'up', 'few', 'minutes', 'old', 'blind', 'woman', 'issuing', 'creepy', 'ominous', 'portents', 'are', 'rotting', 'corpses', 'gruesome', 'special', 'effects', 'eerie', 'old', 'codgers', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'mostly', 'cheap', 'scares', 'ghost-tale', 'cliches', 'Given', 'film', 'relation', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'title', 'dumbest', 'year.Bonus', 'extras', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'writer', 'producer', 'featurette', 'Seeing', 'Ghosts', 'True', 'Story', 'Wyricks', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bloopers']",The Haunting In Connecticut 2: Ghosts Of Georgia Digital

After a family moves into a new home they are excited and ready for their new life. When their young daughter starts to talk to people who aren't there they are a little worried. When they find out the people she is talking to are the dead people that used to live in the house they become very worried and wonder if they can do anything about it before its too late for her, and them. I will admit that the first one creeped my out quite a bit so I was a little scared already going in to this one. While the first one was more psychological this one is way more in your face scary, and to me thats not as good. I'm also not sure why this is called what it is. The movie has nothing to do with the first one, and it's not even in Connecticut, but that is another review. Since this technically is a sequel though I can say that like most sequels this isn't as good as the first one. Overall, like the first one in name only.

1623403,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00B96TGQS,Z Hayes,"[3, 4]","I enjoyed the first Haunting in Connecticut and was eager to watch this second installment based on my brother's recommendation (both of us love horror movies, especially supernatural-themed ones). My brother also told me that there is a lot of history in this film so my curiosity was piqued.Aside from the title (Haunting in Connecticut), this is a totally different film. First of all it is set in Georgia and revolves around a new cast of characters. I guess the use of The Haunting... title is to show that it is part of a series of movies? Well, it did not affect my enjoyment of the film, in fact, I liked it and enjoyed the historical thread in the narrative.The film centers on the Wyrick family comprising Andy (Chad Michael Murray), Lisa (Abigail Spencer), and young Heidi (Emily Alyn Lind). They are soon joined by Lisa's sister, Joyce (Katee Sackhoff) who bunks in at the old trailer by their house. Set in the countryside, the isolated house has historic significance, and soon enough the Wyrick family and Joyce discover that they are not the only inhabitants in the house and the surroundings. Lisa has the 'sight' but has shut this 'gift' out of her, taking pills to avoid dealing with the disturbing visions that intrude upon her thoughts. Her husband Andy is understanding and tries to help her, but is frustrated by her refusal to accept the reality of her gift. When young Heidi begins seeing a mysterious character named Mr. Gordy, only her aunt Joyce seems to show compassion and understanding. Lisa is upset that her daughter has inherited this family trait of being able to see supernatural entities, and her way of dealing with it is by demanding Heidi block it out.As time passes, a series of mysterious events occur around the area and also in the house. Spectral beings are seen by Lisa, Heidi, and Joyce, and after a visit by the local preacher, the family comes to learn that a former inhabitant of the house was a Stationmaster in the Underground Railroad, providing shelter to escaped slaves before they made their way to the North and freedom. As time passes, the supernatural events escalate to the point where the family's very existence is threatened. The question is: What do the supernatural entities want?The story has some interesting twists in it that keeps viewers engaged with the plot. I enjoyed the historical thread in the plot and how it tied in with the supernatural occurrences. There were some unexpected twists that made it even more interesting, and the main characters though not great, delivered credible performances, although I must admit I got tired of Lisa's refusal to accept that her daughter was indeed being visited by supernatural entities and could see spooky stuff.Overall, this made for an entertaining supernatural film and held my attention. The weaving in of historical aspects elevated Ghosts of Georgia above the average, ho-hum horror flick. The production qualities were good, and there was a high sense of atmosphere which works great in movies like this. I would rate this as mildly scary but if you enjoy some history in your horror films then this would be worth a try.",4,Engaging blend of the supernatural and history,1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,3147,"['enjoyed', 'first', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'second', 'installment', 'based', 'brother', 'recommendation', 'love', 'horror', 'movies', 'especially', 'supernatural-themed', 'ones', 'brother', 'also', 'told', 'lot', 'history', 'film', 'so', 'curiosity', 'was', 'piqued.Aside', 'title', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'totally', 'different', 'film', 'First', 'set', 'Georgia', 'around', 'new', 'cast', 'characters', 'guess', 'use', 'Haunting', 'title', 'show', 'part', 'series', 'movies', 'Well', 'did', 'not', 'affect', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'fact', 'liked', 'enjoyed', 'historical', 'thread', 'narrative.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Wyrick', 'family', 'comprising', 'Andy', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'Lisa', 'Abigail', 'Spencer', 'young', 'Heidi', 'Emily', 'Alyn', 'Lind', 'are', 'soon', 'joined', 'Lisa', 'sister', 'Joyce', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'who', 'old', 'trailer', 'house', 'Set', 'countryside', 'isolated', 'house', 'historic', 'significance', 'soon', 'enough', 'Wyrick', 'family', 'Joyce', 'discover', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'inhabitants', 'house', 'surroundings', 'Lisa', ""'sight"", 'shut', ""'gift"", 'taking', 'pills', 'avoid', 'dealing', 'disturbing', 'visions', 'intrude', 'thoughts', 'husband', 'Andy', 'understanding', 'tries', 'help', 'frustrated', 'refusal', 'accept', 'reality', 'gift', 'When', 'young', 'Heidi', 'seeing', 'mysterious', 'character', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Gordy', 'only', 'aunt', 'Joyce', 'show', 'compassion', 'understanding', 'Lisa', 'upset', 'daughter', 'inherited', 'family', 'trait', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'supernatural', 'entities', 'way', 'dealing', 'demanding', 'Heidi', 'block', 'out.As', 'time', 'passes', 'series', 'mysterious', 'events', 'occur', 'area', 'also', 'house', 'Spectral', 'beings', 'are', 'seen', 'Lisa', 'Heidi', 'Joyce', 'visit', 'local', 'preacher', 'family', 'learn', 'former', 'inhabitant', 'house', 'was', 'Stationmaster', 'Underground', 'Railroad', 'providing', 'shelter', 'escaped', 'slaves', 'made', 'way', 'North', 'freedom', 'time', 'passes', 'supernatural', 'events', 'escalate', 'point', 'where', 'family', 'very', 'existence', 'threatened', 'question', 'What', 'do', 'supernatural', 'entities', 'want', 'story', 'interesting', 'twists', 'viewers', 'engaged', 'plot', 'enjoyed', 'historical', 'thread', 'plot', 'how', 'tied', 'supernatural', 'occurrences', 'were', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'main', 'characters', 'not', 'great', 'delivered', 'credible', 'performances', 'must', 'admit', 'got', 'tired', 'Lisa', 'refusal', 'accept', 'daughter', 'was', 'indeed', 'being', 'visited', 'supernatural', 'entities', 'could', 'see', 'spooky', 'stuff.Overall', 'made', 'entertaining', 'supernatural', 'film', 'held', 'attention', 'weaving', 'historical', 'aspects', 'elevated', 'Ghosts', 'Georgia', 'average', 'ho-hum', 'horror', 'flick', 'production', 'qualities', 'were', 'good', 'there', 'was', 'high', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'great', 'movies', 'would', 'rate', 'mildly', 'scary', 'enjoy', 'history', 'horror', 'films', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'try']",The Haunting In Connecticut 2: Ghosts Of Georgia Digital
