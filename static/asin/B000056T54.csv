570731,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B000056T54,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[35, 37]","LAST SEEN WEARING was one of the first dramatizations of the BBC/PBS series of 33 episodes based on the character of Endeavor Morse, Detective Chief Inspector of the Thames Valley Police Department--serving the city of Oxford in England. LSW is actually based on one of the 13 books Dexter wrote, and contains  a clever and complex plot. I think I'm fairly intelligent, and I read many mysteries, but I will say, I was baffled by this story. I read the book first, and recommend you do too.The storyline is this--a young girl who is a day student at a private girl's school fails to come home one day. The police are called in to find the girl. Six months later, the girl is still missing and Morse is put on the case.  He tells Sargeant Lewis, &quot;She's dead.&quot;  &quot;Why do you say that Sir?&quot; says Lewis. Morse replies, &quot;Because I'm the three-file man. They bring me in when there are three files, and when there are three files, someone's gone missing too long.&quot;  So the first mystery is this, is the girl alive as Lewis says, or is she dead as Morse insists??If she is dead, who killed her? The headmaster of the school has been behaving suspiciously. His wife thinks his actions are odd. The assistant head mistress seems to have some knowledge she is keeping under wraps. And then there's the father who has access to all sorts of earth-moving equipment--and he's her stepfather after all and a wealthy one at that. On the other hand, one of the male instructors quit quite recently, around the time when the young girl disappeared. He moved onto a lower paying job in another school. Why would he do that?For regular fans of BBC/PBS drama and comedy, the cast is filled with many familiar faces. Julia Sawhalia (&quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;) and Hugh Grant's old girl friend (Estee Lauder model) play students. &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; fans will recognize the actor who plays Alistair. In LSW he plays the young male teacher who recently vacated his job at the private school where the female student disappeared.The DVD is excellent. The shots of the English countryside are wonderful. The crisp clear photography reveals the black circles under Morse's eyes (he has a little alcohol problem) as well as the 20 layers of dirty green paint on the long corridor in the old police headquarters building. This is vintage stuff.",5,Excellent plot line and fine acting....,982972800,"02 24, 2001",2001,2395,"['LAST', 'SEEN', 'WEARING', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'dramatizations', 'BBC/PBS', 'series', '33', 'episodes', 'based', 'character', 'Endeavor', 'Morse', 'Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Thames', 'Valley', 'Police', 'Department', 'serving', 'city', 'Oxford', 'England', 'LSW', 'actually', 'based', 'one', '13', 'books', 'Dexter', 'wrote', 'clever', 'complex', 'plot', 'think', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'intelligent', 'read', 'many', 'mysteries', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'baffled', 'story', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'recommend', 'do', 'too.The', 'storyline', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'day', 'student', 'private', 'girl', 'school', 'come', 'home', 'one', 'day', 'police', 'are', 'called', 'find', 'girl', 'Six', 'months', 'later', 'girl', 'still', 'missing', 'Morse', 'put', 'case', 'Sargeant', 'Lewis', 'quot', 'dead.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Why', 'do', 'say', 'Sir', 'quot', 'Lewis', 'Morse', 'replies', 'quot', ""'m"", 'three-file', 'man', 'bring', 'when', 'are', 'three', 'files', 'when', 'are', 'three', 'files', 'someone', 'gone', 'missing', 'too', 'long.', 'quot', 'first', 'mystery', 'girl', 'alive', 'Lewis', 'dead', 'Morse', 'insists', 'dead', 'who', 'killed', 'headmaster', 'school', 'been', 'behaving', 'suspiciously', 'wife', 'actions', 'are', 'odd', 'assistant', 'head', 'mistress', 'have', 'knowledge', 'keeping', 'wraps', 'then', 'father', 'who', 'access', 'sorts', 'earth-moving', 'equipment', 'stepfather', 'wealthy', 'one', 'other', 'hand', 'one', 'male', 'instructors', 'quit', 'quite', 'recently', 'time', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'disappeared', 'moved', 'lower', 'paying', 'job', 'school', 'Why', 'would', 'do', 'regular', 'fans', 'BBC/PBS', 'drama', 'comedy', 'cast', 'filled', 'many', 'familiar', 'Julia', 'Sawhalia', 'quot', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'quot', 'quot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'quot', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'old', 'girl', 'friend', 'Estee', 'Lauder', 'model', 'play', 'students', 'quot', 'Time', 'Goes', 'quot', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'actor', 'who', 'Alistair', 'LSW', 'young', 'male', 'teacher', 'who', 'recently', 'vacated', 'job', 'private', 'school', 'where', 'female', 'student', 'disappeared.The', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'shots', 'English', 'countryside', 'are', 'wonderful', 'crisp', 'clear', 'photography', 'black', 'circles', 'Morse', 'eyes', 'little', 'alcohol', 'problem', 'as', 'well', '20', 'layers', 'dirty', 'green', 'paint', 'long', 'corridor', 'old', 'police', 'headquarters', 'building', 'vintage', 'stuff']",N/A

570735,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B000056T54,FYI,"[18, 22]","The 1980s don't look too awful in Oxford, England, just grainy, something that seems to be an issue with several early Morse episodes. At least polyester and big hair made few inroads, low-tides of fashion simply didn't wash up on Oxford's rarified shoreline. This collection features three mysteries that don't rate the usual 5 stars, because they don't represent the overall Morse oeuvre well, and the filming is utterly dreadful. The experimental shots are claustrophobic, with pretentious mirror images and narrow, sloping filming that make it feel like you're viewing the story through a drunk shoebox. Thankfully, by Set Three, everything is level and excellent again, allowing Morse to stew in his own juices, not those of a pickled lens. When you sail to the far shore, after viewing Set 1 - 11, I strongly recommend continuing your journey with the erudite and cleverComplete Inspector Lewis. The dynamics between Detective Inspector Lewis and the wry Sergeant Hathaway (Laurence Fox) are a treat.The Wolfvercote Tongue: The owner of the missing, precious Anglo-Saxon jewel, the Wolvercote Tongue, has been murdered. The filming is nauseating, the story ok. Morse bucks the pathologist's report, believing this is more than a garden-variety heart attack.Last Seen Wearing: Morse believes a missing schoolgirl has in fact been murdered; he discovers things are not all they seem at her exclusive school. As withMidsomer Murders: The Early Cases Collection, the body count rises as the case unfolds. A very young Elizabeth Hurley guest stars as a schoolgirl.The Settling of the Sun: Silly story line, again, horribly filmed. These three mysteries don't develop the characters well, especially the relationship between Morse and Lewis. Don't worry, it gets much, much better after this. Here, the tranquil cloisters of Oxford College are haunted by the ghosts of WWII, and are the setting for revenge killings. Inspector Morse finds himself dining amongst the suspects, a dangerous side-course indeed.",3,"The Usual Suspects, Or Not",1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,2007,"['1980s', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'awful', 'Oxford', 'England', 'just', 'grainy', 'something', 'be', 'issue', 'several', 'early', 'Morse', 'episodes', 'least', 'polyester', 'big', 'hair', 'made', 'few', 'inroads', 'low-tides', 'fashion', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'wash', 'up', 'Oxford', 'rarified', 'shoreline', 'collection', 'three', 'mysteries', 'do', ""n't"", 'rate', 'usual', '5', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'represent', 'overall', 'Morse', 'oeuvre', 'well', 'filming', 'utterly', 'dreadful', 'experimental', 'shots', 'are', 'claustrophobic', 'pretentious', 'mirror', 'images', 'narrow', 'sloping', 'filming', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'viewing', 'story', 'drunk', 'shoebox', 'Thankfully', 'Set', 'Three', 'everything', 'level', 'excellent', 'again', 'allowing', 'Morse', 'stew', 'own', 'juices', 'not', 'pickled', 'lens', 'When', 'sail', 'far', 'shore', 'viewing', 'Set', '1', '11', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'continuing', 'journey', 'erudite', 'cleverComplete', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'dynamics', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'wry', 'Sergeant', 'Hathaway', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'are', 'treat.The', 'Wolfvercote', 'Tongue', 'owner', 'missing', 'precious', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'jewel', 'Wolvercote', 'Tongue', 'been', 'murdered', 'filming', 'nauseating', 'story', 'ok.', 'Morse', 'pathologist', 'report', 'believing', 'more', 'garden-variety', 'heart', 'attack.Last', 'Seen', 'Wearing', 'Morse', 'missing', 'schoolgirl', 'fact', 'been', 'murdered', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'seem', 'exclusive', 'school', 'withMidsomer', 'Murders', 'Early', 'Cases', 'Collection', 'body', 'count', 'case', 'very', 'young', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'guest', 'stars', 'schoolgirl.The', 'Settling', 'Sun', 'Silly', 'story', 'line', 'again', 'horribly', 'filmed', 'three', 'mysteries', 'do', ""n't"", 'develop', 'characters', 'well', 'especially', 'relationship', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'Here', 'tranquil', 'cloisters', 'Oxford', 'College', 'are', 'haunted', 'ghosts', 'WWII', 'are', 'setting', 'revenge', 'killings', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'dining', 'suspects', 'dangerous', 'side-course', 'indeed']",N/A
570736,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B000056T54,Happy Reader,"[12, 13]","This is Set Two of eleven ""Inspector Morse"" Sets. Each Set has three episodes/discs. Don't confuse these eleven ""Sets"" with the previously issued (but still available) ""Collection Sets"". Each of the six ""Collection Sets"" cost more, as each has more episodes/discs than these Sets.This Set has three episodes, all from Series 2 (what we call seasons in the U.S.). They originally aired December 1987 and March 1988 in this same order. The British Series 2 series included one more episode, ""Last Bus to Woodstock"", which has been moved to the next Set Three of these Inspector Morse DVD sets.In ""The Story of Morse"" a 50 minute documentary about Inspector Morse, Colin Dexter says this: ""If you're going to write right about forensics and pathology and ballistics and so on, obviously you've got to know your onion. But I know nothing. Absolutely nothing about that. And if you write who-done-its, in other words, the central idea of the author is to dangle half a dozen people in front of you, so you always guess the wrong one; never the one you thought of; never the butler, and all these sorts of things, the less you know of police work, the better! And you just want to mystify everybody, don't you?!""Episodes:The Wolvercote TongueLast Seen WearingThe Settling of the SunTHE WOLVERCOTE TONGUE:A tour bus pulls into Oxford. It's a high-end tour with only 12 participants, lead by the tired and disaffected guide, Sheila Williams (played by Roberta Taylor). She rushes from the bus to meet Dr. Simon Kemp - whose name should be Dr. Shallow - only to have him tell her his wife says he can't see her anymore.Laura and Eddie Poindexter are on the tour. The Oxford stop is important, because the wealthy Laura is donating the Wolvercote Tongue to the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology, the first university museum in the world, established 1677. The tongue is part of an ornate two piece belt buckle, somehow separated after they were dug up together. The Ashmolean already has the buckle.Eddie returns to their Randolph Hotel room to find Laura dead and the Wolvercote Tongue gone. Was it really just a heart attack?Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on a short story by Colin Dexter. In 1992, well after the TV episode first aired, Dexter expanded the short story into a novel titled ""The Jewel That Was Ours"", though there are differences between the novel and the show. Dexter's walk-on is when he appears as the man behind Morse in The Chapter Bar of the Randolph. This episode is full of lovely wry humor, especially in the interactions between Morse, Lewis and Max de Bryn, the pathologist.LAST SEEN WEARING:Morse is grumpy when he's given a new file. It's Valerie Craven, a teenager missing for six months. The only reason he's given this missing persons case is that Valerie's father, construction magnate George Craven, is not just rich, but on the Police Committee. Lewis is raring to go, trying to give Morse the 3 files compiled on the missing girl, but Morse isn't interested: ""I'm sorry to disappoint you, Lewis, but she's dead.... They put me onto these things when they can smell a corpse. One file - Anybody. Two files - Ainsley or McCay. I'm the three-file man. No, she's dead.""Another reason Morse is disgusted with handling the case. He's supposed to solve it, but he's not supposed to bother the family. He interviews the father anyway (which gets him in trouble). Lewis: ""The thing with you is, if somebody tells you you can't do something, you go right on and do it, don't you?""Morse: ""I make it a rule.""This is a murder mystery, so there's going to be a body. But will it be Valerie's?Trivia: This episode was written by Thomas Ellice, based on the 2nd Colin Dexter novel of the same name, published in 1976.THE SETTLING OF THE SUN:An Oxford school has a welcoming dinner for its summer international students. Morse is at the head table, next to his friend, Dr. Jane Robson. At her request, he created a crossword puzzle for the summer attendees. He's there to give a prize to the student who does the best on the crossword. Morse gives a little speech before awarding the prize: ""On the whole, crosswords are far more exotic and exciting than police work. Most murders, for example, don't require solving because they haven't been planned. Thought a lot about, perhaps, over the years. Not as murders, but as silence. The silence of a wife, a husband, a son or a daughter, even. No more words, talk, screams, arguments, insults. Insults more often lead to murder than anything else in my experience.""During the dinner, a student from Japan suddenly takes ill, and leaves the hall for his room. He shortly turns up murdered, his body laid out as if a crucifix. Is this hatred left over from WWII?Another doomed love for Morse. And his speech is prophetic - in the breach.Trivia: This episode, written by Charles Wood, is based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is when he appears as the doctor sitting on the bed next to Jane's bed, in the very last scene.",5,Episode Synopsis of Fantastic Mystery Series from across the pond!,1337126400,"05

He reads good literature and listens to good music; Thomas Hardy and Wagner in this BBC film. He drinks too much, usually two pints of ""bitters"" at a time. When told by his Superintendant not to do something, he does it before anything else. The Superintendant is usually angry at him - for failing to obey his orders and for asking for some scotch at a murder scene in this case - but he still relies on him for complicated cases because of his successes. Yet despite his abilities and his ultimate successes, he generally gets matters wrong the first, second, and third time, before getting it right. These matters include misreading the people and developing a wrong case theory.In this case, the daughter of a wealthy well-placed man disappears. Morse is handed the case after six months. He insists that the girl is dead, but since the police recently received a letter allegedly written by her, everyone else thinks she is still alive.

But construction noise (by a firm that later turns out to be tied into the case) disturbs him and he goes into work--where he continues to read Hardy, and ignore the files that his eager Seargant attempts to thrust into his face.The pathologist, in trying to get Morse to feel the pain of the parents' loss of their daughter says, ""Imagine that your copy of the Ring Cycle [Wagner's interminable opera] was destroyed and it was your only one."" Yes, as the editorial review says, the ""cultured curmudgeon."" I love it!Morse's lined face, slight paunch, in-need-of-a-haircut and always in need of a drink gives us a completely different portrait than, say, the dapper Poirot.

Morese doesn't miss a beat to confirm or deny, but simply says, ""Are you the tyrant?""His boss asks Morse if this flu of his is really a depression. Though Morse denies it, this seems likely.

570740,A9TG2NFA614S9,B000056T54,John F. Rooney,"[0, 0]","In ""Last Seen Wearing"" (1988) Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse and his minion, Sergeant Lewis, are assigned to a missing person case. A teenage schoolgirl, Valerie, a day student, has been missing for months from an exclusive private school. Morse says immediately without doubt that she is dead. Lewis who has two daughters says he thinks not, but Morse is positive. If you've watched Morse working cases before, you know, brilliant though he is, he often goes off half-cocked. The father is a tyrannical millionaire-builder who treats Morse with complete disdain. A letter has been received from the girl saying she is all right, but Morse thinks that someone has doctored one of the girl's old letters.The girl's teachers and the young egocentric headmaster of the school become suspects. Without any evidence Morse says that when the girl disappeared, she was pregnant. It's another of his wild guesses.Morse tools around in his red Jag interrogating suspects. Actor John Thaw does a good job of portraying the prickly inspector, and Lewis is interpreted with great skill by Kevin Whately. Elizabeth Hurley also appears in this episode.This TV film is much better than ""Deadly Slumber"" because it's actually based on a Dexter novel rather than just the character of Morse. The story is richer; it has touches of humor; the characterizations are much deeper; and the often comic by-play between Morse and Lewis is far better delineated. Morse's conflicts with Superintendent Strange and even with pathologist Max are very well done.Morse is fond of Classical music especially Wagner's ring cycle, crossword puzzles, and he enjoys reading Thomas Hardy. He enjoys his pints in pubs but can get livid when time is called when he hasn't had his ration. Morse in a pub gets another pint and rationalizes it by saying, ""When I'm thinking, I get thirsty."" He also says to his sergeant, ""You're such a prude, Lewis.""Valerie was a wild girl who turns out to have had an affair. Morse, in order ""to make things happen"" goes over the line and breaks the law more than once even resorting to forgery. Morse uses lateral thinking (""I can't think in straight lines."") which often proves wrong.One of the suspects is murdered, and Lewis blows up at his boss and says, ""You were so keen to have a murder.""After his usual false starts, Morse is able to eke out a solution, but we have great fun on the journey.",5,Will the Real Morse Please Rise?,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,2394,"['Last', 'Seen', 'Wearing', '1988', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'minion', 'Sergeant', 'Lewis', 'are', 'assigned', 'missing', 'person', 'case', 'teenage', 'schoolgirl', 'Valerie', 'day', 'student', 'been', 'missing', 'months', 'exclusive', 'private', 'school', 'Morse', 'immediately', 'doubt', 'dead', 'Lewis', 'who', 'two', 'daughters', 'not', 'Morse', 'positive', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Morse', 'working', 'cases', 'know', 'brilliant', 'often', 'half-cocked', 'father', 'tyrannical', 'millionaire-builder', 'who', 'Morse', 'complete', 'disdain', 'letter', 'been', 'received', 'girl', 'saying', 'right', 'Morse', 'someone', 'doctored', 'one', 'girl', 'old', 'letters.The', 'girl', 'teachers', 'young', 'egocentric', 'headmaster', 'school', 'become', 'suspects', 'evidence', 'Morse', 'when', 'girl', 'disappeared', 'was', 'pregnant', 'wild', 'guesses.Morse', 'tools', 'around', 'red', 'Jag', 'interrogating', 'suspects', 'Actor', 'John', 'Thaw', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'prickly', 'inspector', 'Lewis', 'interpreted', 'great', 'skill', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'also', 'episode.This', 'TV', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'Deadly', 'Slumber', 'actually', 'based', 'Dexter', 'novel', 'rather', 'just', 'character', 'Morse', 'story', 'richer', 'touches', 'humor', 'characterizations', 'are', 'much', 'deeper', 'often', 'comic', 'by-play', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'far', 'better', 'delineated', 'Morse', 'conflicts', 'Superintendent', 'Strange', 'even', 'pathologist', 'Max', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done.Morse', 'fond', 'Classical', 'music', 'especially', 'Wagner', 'ring', 'cycle', 'crossword', 'puzzles', 'reading', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'pints', 'pubs', 'can', 'get', 'livid', 'when', 'time', 'called', 'when', ""n't"", 'had', 'ration', 'Morse', 'pub', 'pint', 'rationalizes', 'saying', 'When', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'get', 'thirsty', 'also', 'sergeant', ""'re"", 'prude', 'Lewis', 'Valerie', 'was', 'wild', 'girl', 'who', 'out', 'have', 'had', 'affair', 'Morse', 'order', 'make', 'things', 'happen', 'line', 'breaks', 'law', 'more', 'once', 'even', 'resorting', 'forgery', 'Morse', 'lateral', 'thinking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'straight', 'lines', 'often', 'wrong.One', 'suspects', 'murdered', 'Lewis', 'up', 'boss', 'were', 'so', 'keen', 'have', 'murder', 'usual', 'false', 'starts', 'Morse', 'able', 'eke', 'out', 'solution', 'have', 'great', 'fun', 'journey']",N/A

570748,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000056T54,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is addicted to crosswords, easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting.This set though contains one very good episode, and two less than great ones.The Wolvercote TongueIn The Wolvercote Tongue, an American tourist is found dead while resting in her hotel room. Though her death is initially ruled as the result of a coronary attack, Morse is convinced that something must have brought about her death, especially since the dead woman was about to present a prized jewel called The Wolvercote Tongue to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. When another body turns up soon after, Morse is convinced all is not right, and sets about solving the murder mystery with his long suffering detective sergeant, Lewis (Kevin Whately who went on later to star in his own series,Masterpiece Mystery: Complete Inspector LewisLast Seen WearingThis is one of my favorite Morse mysteries. In Last Seen Wearing, a teenage student at an elite prep school has been missing for the past several months. The case finally lands in Morse's lap, and he confidently tells Lewis that the girl is dead. Lewis refuses to accept this, and eventually Morse gets on board and the duo start investigating. Everything points to the girl's school, and the list of suspects is long. The headmaster appears to be hiding something; the deputy head (a woman with lesbian tendencies) seems to know something but refuses to divulge any information; the male French teacher has upped and left, transferring to another school; and then there's the girl's stepfather, a powerful businessman who may or may not have something to hide.I like how Morse conducts his interviews as they are done in such a manner as to be considered thinly-veiled interrogations, and often putting the interviewee at an awkward disadvantage. There are some familiar faces in this episode - a very young Elizabeth Hurley who plays a student at the school, and also Julia Sawalha from Pride and Prejudice and Lark Rise to Candleford. Lewis' role is more of a hands-on, dig in the dirt kind in that he spends much of his time roaming around trying to piece the other pieces of the puzzle. Together, Morse and Lewis make a formidable team indeed.The Settling of the SunThe Settling of the Sun is another Morse episode that I felt was underwhelming for several reasons. It is one of the bleakest of the Morse episodes, lacking some of usual wit and humor in other episodes, and centers around a conspiracy, dating back to the war years and its repercussions.Morse is invited to present a prize for a crossword competition organized for a group of international students. When one of the students is found murdered, Morse's investigations reveal a darker motive that goes back to the war years (the dead student is a Japanese).Usually, the supporting cast in the Morse episodes do an excellent job, but not so in this particular episode. I found some of the acting over the top, and some less than credible. Aside from that, Morse falls for a lady professor here, but unlike the women in other Morse episodes (beautiful, charming, witty, and intelligent), this lady appeared high-strung, whiny, had mood swings, and was generally a very unappealing character. This made it difficult to understand or even believe Morse's attraction to her.Final verdict - strictly for fans only.",3,I love Morse but this set is a mixed bag,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,3688,"['John', 'Thaw', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'investigative', 'dramas', 'Thaw', 'Morse', 'compelling', 'watch', 'listening', 'operatic', 'music', 'quality', 'pint', 'ale', 'addicted', 'crosswords', 'easily', 'smitten', 'pretty', 'face', 'intelligence', 'meticulous', 'astute', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'Morse', 'consummate', 'detective', 'most', 'Morse', 'episodes', 'are', 'superior', 'quality', 'terms', 'writing', 'acting.This', 'set', 'contains', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'episode', 'two', 'less', 'great', 'ones.The', 'Wolvercote', 'TongueIn', 'Wolvercote', 'Tongue', 'American', 'tourist', 'found', 'dead', 'resting', 'hotel', 'room', 'death', 'initially', 'ruled', 'result', 'coronary', 'attack', 'Morse', 'convinced', 'something', 'must', 'have', 'brought', 'death', 'especially', 'dead', 'woman', 'was', 'present', 'prized', 'jewel', 'called', 'Wolvercote', 'Tongue', 'Ashmolean', 'Museum', 'Oxford', 'When', 'body', 'up', 'soon', 'Morse', 'convinced', 'not', 'right', 'sets', 'solving', 'murder', 'mystery', 'long', 'suffering', 'detective', 'sergeant', 'Lewis', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'who', 'went', 'later', 'star', 'own', 'series', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'Complete', 'Inspector', 'LewisLast', 'Seen', 'WearingThis', 'one', 'favorite', 'Morse', 'mysteries', 'Last', 'Seen', 'Wearing', 'teenage', 'student', 'elite', 'prep', 'school', 'been', 'missing', 'past', 'several', 'months', 'case', 'finally', 'Morse', 'lap', 'confidently', 'Lewis', 'girl', 'dead', 'Lewis', 'accept', 'eventually', 'Morse', 'board', 'duo', 'start', 'investigating', 'Everything', 'points', 'girl', 'school', 'list', 'suspects', 'long', 'headmaster', 'be', 'hiding', 'something', 'deputy', 'head', 'woman', 'lesbian', 'tendencies', 'know', 'something', 'divulge', 'information', 'male', 'French', 'teacher', 'upped', 'left', 'transferring', 'school', 'then', 'girl', 'stepfather', 'powerful', 'businessman', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'something', 'hide.I', 'how', 'Morse', 'interviews', 'are', 'done', 'such', 'manner', 'be', 'considered', 'thinly-veiled', 'interrogations', 'often', 'putting', 'interviewee', 'awkward', 'disadvantage', 'are', 'familiar', 'episode', 'very', 'young', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'who', 'student', 'school', 'also', 'Julia', 'Sawalha', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'Lewis', 'role', 'more', 'hands-on', 'dig', 'dirt', 'kind', 'much', 'time', 'roaming', 'around', 'trying', 'piece', 'other', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'Together', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'make', 'formidable', 'team', 'indeed.The', 'Settling', 'SunThe', 'Settling', 'Sun', 'Morse', 'episode', 'felt', 'was', 'underwhelming', 'several', 'reasons', 'one', 'bleakest', 'Morse', 'episodes', 'lacking', 'usual', 'wit', 'humor', 'other', 'episodes', 'centers', 'conspiracy', 'dating', 'back', 'war', 'years', 'repercussions.Morse', 'invited', 'present', 'prize', 'crossword', 'competition', 'organized', 'group', 'international', 'students', 'When', 'one', 'students', 'found', 'murdered', 'Morse', 'investigations', 'reveal', 'darker', 'motive', 'back', 'war', 'years', 'dead', 'student', 'Japanese', '.Usually', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Morse', 'episodes', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'not', 'so', 'particular', 'episode', 'found', 'acting', 'top', 'less', 'credible', 'Aside', 'Morse', 'lady', 'professor', 'here', 'women', 'other', 'Morse', 'episodes', 'beautiful', 'charming', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'lady', 'appeared', 'high-strung', 'whiny', 'had', 'mood', 'swings', 'was', 'generally', 'very', 'unappealing', 'character', 'made', 'difficult', 'understand', 'even', 'believe', 'Morse', 'attraction', 'her.Final', 'verdict', 'strictly', 'fans', 'only']",N/A
