1462895,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B005J47QQ8,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[4, 6]","A Human Resource manager, only known to us by title, is pressured to deal with the death of a  woman who worked at the large industrial bakery.  Yulia Petracke, employed in the cleaning department is dead, and the victim of a suicide bomber in Jerusalem.  And, the newspaper is intent on breaking the story how an employee can be dead for over a week in the morgue, and nobody from the company knows about it.The H.R. Manager, with his own personal problems at home, divorced and with a daughter he doesn't spend much time with, is sent to make amends to the family and  travels to Romania with the body, for burial.  The newspaper reporter/photographer eager for the negativity for the story, makes the trip along with the dead woman's ex-husband.  They soon reach the woman's 13 year old son, in all his bitterness and anger.  The brown casket sits atop the traveling van.  The journey has its catastrophes.Billed as a tragicomedy or perhaps even black comedy, but you will not see much of anything deemed as humorous.  The mood is here, the sadness, the lack of compassion.  The viewer experiencess a cold feeling of how a woman can slip through the cracks through employment with the callous company who doesn't even know she is gone.  You will learn from her supervisor how this happened.When the Human Resource Manager takes that journey for her hometown burial, we see a side of him that changes; his experiences differ, he appreciates his homelife as he travels with the dead woman.  And most important, he gains new perspectives about humans, etc.There are no character names in the film, and the characters are only known as their title, or son, grandmother, daughter, newspaper reporter, driver, etc., etc.  This brings the dead girl as the focus of a moving, sad drama of an unknown woman.Some people may not see the emotional aspect of the film, but it is there, developing slowly and giving the viewer a chance to feel the moods, sense the anxiety and unknown, and to gain insight into life's experiences and changes through unfortunate results.The landscape is stark and cold, music fitting the moods.  Subtitles are yellow, large and clear.  Often, you will hear English spoke throughout the film.As always, with Film Movement comes a Short Film Of The Month, labeled as a true story, called  Tell Your Children, a five-minute film from Hungary about a woman who is terrorized and assaulted twice by the Nazis.  ...

1462896,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B005J47QQ8,Andy Orrock,"[2, 3]","This movie is an overlap on a personal Venn Diagram for me.  I read and enjoyed A. B. Yehoshua'sA Woman in Jerusalem, the novel upon which this movie is based.  And, I'm a big consumer of Israeli movies with a great liking for the works of Eran Riklis (director of this film) and his compatriot, Eytan Fox.  Riklis directed the excellentLemon Tree. But it's hisThe Syrian Bridethat is among the best films ever made in my opinion (and, since I mentioned Fox, I'll add thatWalk on Wateris arguably my #1 movie if I was forced to choose).'The Human Resources Manager' - while a faithful adaptation of the book - isn't up to the stirring heights of the two previous Riklis works I've noted above.  It's a nice, small movie but - like the tank the protagonists procure to tread slowly through a nameless ex-Soviet republic - the action never moves out of its heavy, low gear.That's not to say this isn't a film worth watching.  I really like the way Riklis shows the slowly developing relationship between The HR Manager (Mark Ivanir) and The Boy (Noah Silver).  [No one has names here - we have The Divorcee, The Widow, The Weasel (the reporter).]And, I love how Riklis allows Ivanir to slowly warm to his task.  He thinks at first that he's set up to be the fall guy (a woman dies in one of the suicide bombings that swept Israel in those days, no one claims the body, The Weasel pins the callousness on the bakery where she toiled namelessly, the HR - picture and all - gets the tabloid treatment).  But, slowly, Ivanir goes from railing at the absurdity and pointlessness of the task to getting into the spirit and duty of a mission.  The difference? Learning about who she was, who her family was, her selfless move to Jerusalem to better their situation.Of note, is the dynamic between Ivanir and Silver.  The Boy is abandoned and feral when we first meet him.  But there's a tender personality in there wanting to be loved.  By the end of the film, it's clear he's touched The HR Manager.  Words spoken between the two at the end make clear that the relationship will go on from here.",4,"Not up to the greatness of 'The Syrian Bride,' but anything from Eran Riklis is worth watching",1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,2087,"['movie', 'overlap', 'personal', 'Venn', 'Diagram', 'read', 'enjoyed', 'A', 'B.', ""Yehoshua'sA"", 'Woman', 'Jerusalem', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', ""'m"", 'big', 'consumer', 'Israeli', 'movies', 'great', 'liking', 'works', 'Eran', 'Riklis', 'director', 'film', 'compatriot', 'Eytan', 'Fox', 'Riklis', 'directed', 'excellentLemon', 'Tree', 'hisThe', 'Syrian', 'Bridethat', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'opinion', 'mentioned', 'Fox', ""'ll"", 'add', 'thatWalk', 'Wateris', 'arguably', '1', 'movie', 'was', 'forced', 'choose', 'Human', 'Resources', 'Manager', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'book', ""n't"", 'up', 'stirring', 'heights', 'two', 'previous', 'Riklis', ""'ve"", 'noted', 'nice', 'small', 'movie', 'tank', 'protagonists', 'procure', 'tread', 'slowly', 'nameless', 'ex-Soviet', 'republic', 'action', 'never', 'heavy', 'low', 'gear.That', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'really', 'way', 'Riklis', 'slowly', 'developing', 'relationship', 'HR', 'Manager', 'Mark', 'Ivanir', 'Boy', 'Noah', 'Silver', 'one', 'names', 'here', 'have', 'Divorcee', 'Widow', 'Weasel', 'reporter', ']', 'love', 'how', 'Riklis', 'Ivanir', 'slowly', 'warm', 'task', 'first', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'fall', 'guy', 'woman', 'one', 'suicide', 'bombings', 'swept', 'Israel', 'days', 'one', 'body', 'Weasel', 'callousness', 'bakery', 'where', 'toiled', 'namelessly', 'HR', 'picture', 'tabloid', 'treatment', 'slowly', 'Ivanir', 'railing', 'absurdity', 'pointlessness', 'task', 'getting', 'spirit', 'duty', 'mission', 'difference', 'Learning', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'family', 'was', 'selfless', 'move', 'Jerusalem', 'better', 'situation.Of', 'note', 'dynamic', 'Ivanir', 'Silver', 'Boy', 'abandoned', 'feral', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'tender', 'personality', 'there', 'wanting', 'be', 'loved', 'end', 'film', 'clear', 'touched', 'HR', 'Manager', 'Words', 'spoken', 'two', 'end', 'make', 'clear', 'relationship', 'will', 'go', 'here']",The Human Resources Manager

1462899,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005J47QQ8,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","THE HUMAN RESOURCES DIRECTOR (2010, 103 minutes) is a somewhat stunning film in the sense that it is a small, intimate film about a huge trip, it is Israeli, and we hardly get to even hear of these films in the West.This is set circa 2002, Jerusalem. A Romanian guest worker named Iulia (billed as ""Yulia"") is killed in a suicide bombing. An engineer, for some strange reason Yulia was working for a bakery as a janitor until she was fired about a month before the report of her death.Then there seemed to have been some delay in even figuring out who she was - it apparently took some digging. That was because her boss had fallen in love with her. With no job, her boss saw to it she continued to receive a paycheck, and that is how the bakery she worked for identified her.The Human Resources Director is compelled to go on a journey through Jerusalem's silly beaurocracy just to find out exactly who she was and what her work status was. I'm not sure the film ever states what her work status was when she was killed.Here the great Gila Almagor (star of the originalThe Debt (English Subtitled), see my review) stars as ""The Widow"", who is either the big boss of the bakery or something even bigger. She tells the Human Resources Director that he must return Yulia's body to Romania. Accompanying him is The Reporter, who is also called The Weasel, attempting as always to make political hay of Israel's indifference to its guest workers and other foreigners.The Reporter's and HR Director's trip across Romania is somewhat bittersweet and very funny at times with the various characters they encounter, especially the Israeli consul and her hubby.Many viewers have noted problems, so let me set this straight. Yes, as in almost all Israeli films, at just the wrong moment the subtitles disappear. If you don't know Hebrew, or the Israeli accent, you can forget it til the titles come back on - but here, inexplicably all Romanians speak English, so the Israelis speak English with them and no subtitles are needed.Secondly, no one seems to pay too much attention to a prominent character, Yulia's son, played by a very sweet Noah Silver (you might recognize him from ""The Borgias"" as Benito Sforza). I wonder at so many who miss the relationship, or similarity, this boy shares with the HR Director as well as his daughter.When the Director encounters Yulia's mother in a remote Romanian village, I can't help thinking a weird kind of time circuit closes. Here is the old lady, Yulia's mother, who seems to mirror The Widow, The Son who seems to me to mirror the HR Director, and also mirrors his daughter.When the Human Resources Director sees the Son's cell phone images of his mother, and sees many other things, he finally sheds a tear for this woman he never knew. It is then also he feels most sharply the bond with the Son, a street kid from a broken home.This film is full of the dry, nearly emotionless humor typical of Israeli and Romanian film - and it has its share of dark, pathetic moments also typical to Romanian film. I was reminded of the Romanian heartbreaking masterpiece LA MOARTEA DOMNULUI LAZARESCU (The Death of Mr. Lazarescu ( Moartea domnului Lazarescu ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom], see my review) and, of course, there were strange echoes of Gila's starring turn in THE DEBT.It is an interesting, meditative film that I found as fascinating in its Romanian cultural moments as in its cold, soulless Israeli moments. One then sees that Romania was to Yulia what Israel is to the Israeli characters - and that is SAD.",3,"Israel, Romania, our hearts bleed until you show your true natures",1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,3574,"['HUMAN', 'RESOURCES', 'DIRECTOR', '2010', '103', 'minutes', 'somewhat', 'stunning', 'film', 'sense', 'small', 'intimate', 'film', 'huge', 'trip', 'Israeli', 'hardly', 'get', 'even', 'hear', 'films', 'West.This', 'set', 'circa', '2002', 'Jerusalem', 'A', 'Romanian', 'guest', 'worker', 'named', 'Iulia', 'billed', 'Yulia', 'killed', 'suicide', 'bombing', 'engineer', 'strange', 'reason', 'Yulia', 'was', 'working', 'bakery', 'janitor', 'was', 'fired', 'month', 'report', 'death.Then', 'there', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'delay', 'even', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'apparently', 'took', 'digging', 'was', 'boss', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'job', 'boss', 'saw', 'continued', 'receive', 'paycheck', 'how', 'bakery', 'worked', 'identified', 'her.The', 'Human', 'Resources', 'Director', 'compelled', 'go', 'journey', 'Jerusalem', 'silly', 'beaurocracy', 'just', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'work', 'status', 'was', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'ever', 'what', 'work', 'status', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'killed.Here', 'great', 'Gila', 'Almagor', 'star', 'originalThe', 'Debt', 'English', 'Subtitled', 'see', 'review', 'Widow', 'who', 'big', 'boss', 'bakery', 'something', 'even', 'bigger', 'Human', 'Resources', 'Director', 'must', 'return', 'Yulia', 'body', 'Romania', 'Accompanying', 'Reporter', 'who', 'also', 'called', 'Weasel', 'attempting', 'always', 'make', 'political', 'hay', 'Israel', 'indifference', 'guest', 'workers', 'other', 'foreigners.The', 'Reporter', 'HR', 'Director', 'trip', 'Romania', 'somewhat', 'bittersweet', 'very', 'funny', 'times', 'various', 'characters', 'encounter', 'especially', 'Israeli', 'consul', 'hubby.Many', 'viewers', 'have', 'noted', 'problems', 'so', 'let', 'set', 'straight', 'Yes', 'almost', 'Israeli', 'films', 'just', 'wrong', 'moment', 'subtitles', 'disappear', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Hebrew', 'Israeli', 'accent', 'can', 'forget', 'til', 'titles', 'come', 'back', 'here', 'inexplicably', 'Romanians', 'speak', 'English', 'Israelis', 'speak', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'needed.Secondly', 'one', 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'prominent', 'character', 'Yulia', 'son', 'played', 'very', 'sweet', 'Noah', 'Silver', 'might', 'recognize', 'Borgias', 'Benito', 'Sforza', 'wonder', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'miss', 'relationship', 'similarity', 'boy', 'shares', 'HR', 'Director', 'as', 'well', 'daughter.When', 'Director', 'Yulia', 'mother', 'remote', 'Romanian', 'village', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'weird', 'kind', 'time', 'circuit', 'closes', 'Here', 'old', 'lady', 'Yulia', 'mother', 'who', 'mirror', 'Widow', 'Son', 'who', 'mirror', 'HR', 'Director', 'also', 'mirrors', 'daughter.When', 'Human', 'Resources', 'Director', 'Son', 'cell', 'phone', 'images', 'mother', 'sees', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'finally', 'tear', 'woman', 'never', 'knew', 'then', 'also', 'most', 'sharply', 'bond', 'Son', 'street', 'kid', 'broken', 'home.This', 'film', 'full', 'dry', 'nearly', 'emotionless', 'humor', 'typical', 'Israeli', 'Romanian', 'film', 'share', 'dark', 'pathetic', 'moments', 'also', 'typical', 'Romanian', 'film', 'was', 'reminded', 'Romanian', 'heartbreaking', 'masterpiece', 'LA', 'MOARTEA', 'DOMNULUI', 'LAZARESCU', 'Death', 'Mr.', 'Lazarescu', 'Moartea', 'domnului', 'Lazarescu', '[', 'NON-USA', 'FORMAT', 'PAL', 'Reg.2', 'Import', 'United', 'Kingdom', ']', 'see', 'review', 'course', 'were', 'strange', 'echoes', 'Gila', 'starring', 'turn', 'THE', 'DEBT.It', 'interesting', 'meditative', 'film', 'found', 'fascinating', 'Romanian', 'cultural', 'moments', 'cold', 'soulless', 'Israeli', 'moments', 'One', 'then', 'Romania', 'was', 'Yulia', 'what', 'Israel', 'Israeli', 'characters', 'SAD']",The Human Resources Manager

The initial story line, set in Jerusalem 2002, centers on the fact that a female employee of a big bakery, working in Israel as a ""guest worker"" from Romania, died in one of the many suicide attacks that terrorized Israel at the time. Turns out that the woman had been let go from the bakery some weeks before that, without the bakery's top management knowing about it. An Israeli reporter turns the story into one of ""inhuman indifference"" and the company's HR manager is asked to look into it. At that point it looked like the movie might have a political take on the suicide bombings. Eventually, the company decides to pay for taking the woman's body back to Romania for a proper funeral. The movie then takes a compltely different take, and it becomes a road movie on how the woman's body is eventually taken back to the village of her mother, deep into off the beaten track in Romania. I don't want to spoil how it all plays out, you'll just have to see it for yourself.As strange as this movie was, I found myself somehow mesmorized as it kept developing. I picked this up, literally knowing nothing about it, but the ""Film Movement"" stamp of approval was good enough for me, and I was once again rewarded.

The cast is first rate including Mark Ivanir who played the Human Resources Manager. In this film, names are barely used as is in the novel. They are identified in the cast list as the son, ex-husband, widow, consul, etc. The film begins as her unidentified body lays several days in the Jerusalem morgue. When she is finally identified by her paystub from the bakery, the human resources manager tries to reconcile her death. She was a victim of a suicide bombing. He uncovers a woman he never knew and how her life and death would change his own life.The human resources manager travels with the body to Romania where he is met by the Israeli consul in Bucharest. There he finds Yulia's ex-husband and son. Her son and minor wants to go to his grandmother, Yulia's mother, but the distance is far and the place is remote. True in the book, Yulia was a Russian Christian immigrant in Jerusalem, Israel while here she is Romanian Christian. The film is a character driven and soul searching for viewers alike. You can't help but watch and relate. You wonder how one person can make a difference even in death to complete strangers.The quality is first rate on my dvd.
