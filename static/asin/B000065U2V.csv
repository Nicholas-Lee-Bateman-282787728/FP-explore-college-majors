700044,A1H11BV01L91I6,B000065U2V,Ambergold,"[9, 10]","Good, good movie. A dour, silent fisherman still mourning his wife falls in love with a selkie, a woman from the sea, almost on first sight, and gradually their love grows until they will give up anything for each other. But will it be enough to keep them together against all odds? This is not a fabulous or even a superb movie. But it is an unusual and moving romance, carried along particularly by its stunning cinematography and Saffron Burrows' performance as the wild but gentle selkie. Scott Glenn gives a good solid performance as always, and a haunting music score carries it along. I gave it less than four stars because a lot of Scott's lines and dialogue were pretty bad, and it was a little slow-paced. But for anyone who enjoys Hallmark, is a sucker for romance, or just wants something a little different, this is the movie for you.",3,Mmm-great story,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,847,"['Good', 'good', 'movie', 'dour', 'silent', 'fisherman', 'still', 'mourning', 'wife', 'love', 'selkie', 'woman', 'sea', 'almost', 'first', 'sight', 'gradually', 'love', 'grows', 'will', 'give', 'up', 'anything', 'other', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'keep', 'together', 'odds', 'not', 'fabulous', 'even', 'superb', 'movie', 'unusual', 'moving', 'romance', 'carried', 'particularly', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'performance', 'wild', 'gentle', 'selkie', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'good', 'solid', 'performance', 'always', 'haunting', 'music', 'score', 'gave', 'less', 'four', 'stars', 'lot', 'Scott', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'were', 'pretty', 'bad', 'was', 'little', 'slow-paced', 'anyone', 'who', 'Hallmark', 'sucker', 'romance', 'just', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'movie']",The Seventh Stream
700045,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000065U2V,Brian E. Erland,"[61, 61]","An ill-fated love story set against the backdrop of a rustic Irish fishing village. Owen Quinn (Scott Glenn), widower and fisherman has been living a solitary life since his wifes' death five years ago. That all changes when an enchanting and mysterious woman with no name (Saffron Burrows) arrives in the village. She reaches out to him for help and he responds by taking her into his home. She takes the name Mairead and before long her kind and gentle ways heal his loneliness and pain.However their love is not to be, for she is not what she appears to be. She is a seltie, one of the mythical seal people mentioned in Irish legend and lore. Her human form is only temporary, soon she must return to the sea or perish on the shore.This may be a Hallmark Hall of Fame feature made for television, but you wouldn't know it from the production values. This is a wonderfully done film, one of those old-fashioned romantic tearjerkers that will stay with you for a long time. It also contains some of the most breathtaking scenic shots of the Irish coastline you'll ever see.Scott Glenn delivers a strong performance as always, while Saffron Burrows plays the part of the mythical woman/seal to absolute perfection.

They both deal with the Irish legend of the selkie, a seal that takes human form.  This movie is generally well acted with a good story.  The selkie woman finds herself bound to an abusive fisherman due to his finding and hiding of her seal self's skin.  She seeks out kindly fisherman who's lost all joy in his life after the death of his wife.  I was a bit put off by the ""kindly"" fisherman's sometimes violent actions although never towards the selkie woman.  When he believes he will lose her, he trashes his own home in a fit of rage.  This just felt wrong.  Still, it's a worthwhile and well done movie with great photography and scenery.  It brings the legend to life in a sometimes mystical, sometimes blunt, always interesting story.

700049,AG8K92N37MT27,B000065U2V,Garnet,"[0, 0]","This is definitely a movie that reminds me of the line from &#34;The Devil's Own,&#34; where the Brad Pitt character says that its not an American story, but an Irish story.  This is most definitely an Irish story of romance and one that is very much tied to the beauty and the sorrows of the sea.  Its set in the past, in a small fishing village where the luck has run out and the fish have all but disappeared, so everyone is hungry and desperate.  One desperate man is breaking the law by going out killing seals and, in so doing, finds a pelt that has been set aside by one of the selkie, the fairy seal-people who can take on human form by going on land and taking off their sealskins.  He has control over her then by keeping her skin and she brings him loads of fish and so prosperity.However, the romance is between this seal-woman trapped on land and Owen Quinn, a fisherman trapped in the lingering grief of his wife lost at sea 5 years ago and who has closed off his heart ever since.  He has found his solace in books, including Celtic fairytales, while withdrawing from those around him.  He has lost knowledge of his soul in a way.  While the Selkie are said not to have souls.  He and the seal-woman are drawn together, each in their own sadness and longing, and learn in each other what love is and so find their souls together.This is a slow-paced movie, but one that comes to haunt your own heart.  The crash of the waves, the sorrowing cry of the seals for one of their own, the seal-woman--whom Owen names &#34;Mairead,&#34; meaning Pearl, which reminds one of both of the almost transluscent beauty of this woman and of how pearls can be seen as the tears of the ocean--and how she learns about joy and memory, plus the dangers of growing to love something as primal and powerful as the sea, something you can never own...this movie has a flavor all its own.Be warned--if you are looking for a happy happy ending, you will not find it here.  But you will find a heartwarming story with a special magic all its own.

Set in a sleepy Irish coastal village in the early 1900s, Scott Glenn plays Owen Quinn, a lonely and sad widower who pines for his late wife who was his soulmate. Quinn and his best friend Willy (Eamon Morrissey) are both fishermen who have fallen on hard times due to the lack of fishing prospects. In fact, the entire village is experiencing hard financial times, and so it comes as a surprise when one of the least liked village inhabitants, a surly young man named Eamon Dunhill (Joseph Kelly) suddenly prospers. The circumstances are strange - Eamon begins showing up with a beautiful young woman (Saffron Burrows) who tags along with him on his fishing boat, and each time return with a boat full of fish. No one knows the identity of this mysterious young woman, and the village is astir with gossip and speculation.Then things gets even stranger - Quinn finds the young woman spying on him at his isolated home near the sea, and begins to imagine this lady visiting him in his dreams, pleading for his help in recovering something that she has lost. Well, (no spoiler here given the plot), the woman claims to be a selkie who is bound to Eamon and the land as long as Eamon keeps her sealskin. She needs to find the sealskin and return to the sea before the next seventh stream comes to an end.The story has all the elements that make for a riveting watch - suspense, romance, elements of the supernatural, excellent casting, beautiful cinematography of the Irish coast and romantic soundtrack, all of which further enhance the story.
