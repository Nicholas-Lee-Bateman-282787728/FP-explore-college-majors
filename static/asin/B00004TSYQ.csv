The film footage used in this movie from Viet Nam's own files is incredable as you watch the men being parading in front of crowds with the crowds scaring even the NVA soilders. I really felt like I had a better understanding as the men told their stories as their captor's pictures show it as it happens. No Hanks or Stone here.

Additional interviews with the spouses of POW's reveal their pain and emotion they dealt with on the home front while not knowing the fates of their husbands.Finishing off with their triumphant return home, it is truly inspirational and heartwarming to see the footage of these heroic men reunited with their families.This DVD itself has superb sound and video qualities and offers good additional features such as 26 biographies of POW's and interviews with the producers on the making of Return With Honor.This documentary comes very highly recommended to everyone and leaves you with a resounding message of patriotism and a deep respect for America and her U.S. servicemen.",5,An exceptionally good documentary....,1051920000,"05 3, 2003",2003,1349,"['what', 'probably', 'most', 'revealing', 'documentary', 'ever', 'created', 'ex-POW', 'Vietnam', 'Return', 'Honor', 'outstanding', 'testament', 'absolute', 'courage', 'honor', 'bravery', 'camaraderie', 'survival.Individual', 'interviews', 'woven', 'footage', 'United', 'States', 'Vietnamese', 'archives', 'paint', 'very', 'vivid', 'oftentimes', 'emotional', 'picture', 'brutal', 'experience', 'suffered', 'U.S.', 'servicemen', 'held', 'captive', 'Hanoi.Leaving', 'very', 'little', 'imagination', 'documentary', 'many', 'facets', 'captivity', 'include', 'barbaric', 'torture', 'communication', 'processes', 'prisoners', 'coping', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'demoralizing', 'loneliness', 'inhuman', 'living', 'conditions', 'Additional', 'interviews', 'spouses', 'POW', 'reveal', 'pain', 'emotion', 'dealt', 'home', 'front', 'not', 'knowing', 'fates', 'husbands.Finishing', 'triumphant', 'return', 'home', 'truly', 'inspirational', 'heartwarming', 'see', 'footage', 'heroic', 'men', 'reunited', 'families.This', 'DVD', 'superb', 'sound', 'video', 'qualities', 'offers', 'good', 'additional', 'features', 'such', '26', 'biographies', 'POW', 'interviews', 'producers', 'making', 'Return', 'Honor.This', 'documentary', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'everyone', 'resounding', 'message', 'patriotism', 'deep', 'respect', 'America', 'U.S.', 'servicemen']",N/A
551169,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00004TSYQ,Robert I. Hedges,"[0, 0]","""Return With Honor"" is a documentary that everyone should see. Unlike a typical war documentary, this focuses on the inner strengths and emotions of the military men in question, in this case American pilots shot down, imprisoned, and tortured in North Vietnam. I have been privileged to have met many pilots who flew in Vietnam, and a handful of POW's, and can attest that without exception, these are a truly exceptional group of men: this documentary brings their story to life better than any other.The film profiles multiple prisoners with both current interviews and vintage footage, much of it from North Vietnamese archives (the North Vietnamese film of an F-105 on fire still haunts me). The ultimate lessons here are of courage, the indestructibility of the human spirit, and honor. Despite brutal torture these men had a strict code of honor, and although many were offered early releases in exchange for propaganda useful to the North Vietnamese, their motto was ""Return With Honor"" and they lived up to it. Far from being mindless military automatons as they were (and still sometimes are) frequently depicted, these men had a keenly intelligent and insightful world view. One thing that amazed me was the degree of forgiveness that the men themselves had for their former captors: one even became the first US Ambassador to Vietnam after political relations were restored. As for specifics, I was disappointed that Leo Thorsness, F-105 pilot and Medal of Honor winner, was not profiled, but I was considerably more impressed with John McCain after viewing this documentary than I previously had been.The extras on the DVD are all worth watching. I especially liked the biographies of all the men profiled and the ""making of"" feature. I was amazed by the amount of cooperation and freedom the filmmakers received from the government of Vietnam, and was impressed by the fact that Pete Peterson, a man imprisoned in Hanoi for over six years, was appointed and accepted the Ambassadorship to Vietnam in 1997. Truly the ability of humans to heal and forgive is a wonderful thing and this film shows better than any other I can recall the indomitable nature of the human spirit.",5,The Courage Of The Human Spirit Defined,1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,2187,"['Return', 'Honor', 'documentary', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'typical', 'war', 'documentary', 'inner', 'strengths', 'emotions', 'military', 'men', 'question', 'case', 'American', 'pilots', 'shot', 'down', 'imprisoned', 'tortured', 'North', 'Vietnam', 'have', 'been', 'privileged', 'have', 'met', 'many', 'pilots', 'who', 'flew', 'Vietnam', 'handful', 'POW', 'can', 'attest', 'exception', 'are', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'group', 'men', 'documentary', 'story', 'life', 'better', 'other.The', 'film', 'profiles', 'multiple', 'prisoners', 'current', 'interviews', 'vintage', 'footage', 'much', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'archives', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'film', 'F-105', 'fire', 'still', 'ultimate', 'lessons', 'here', 'are', 'courage', 'indestructibility', 'human', 'spirit', 'honor', 'brutal', 'torture', 'men', 'had', 'strict', 'code', 'honor', 'many', 'were', 'offered', 'early', 'releases', 'exchange', 'propaganda', 'useful', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'motto', 'was', 'Return', 'Honor', 'lived', 'up', 'being', 'mindless', 'military', 'automatons', 'were', 'still', 'sometimes', 'are', 'frequently', 'depicted', 'men', 'had', 'keenly', 'intelligent', 'insightful', 'world', 'view', 'One', 'thing', 'amazed', 'was', 'degree', 'forgiveness', 'men', 'had', 'former', 'captors', 'one', 'even', 'became', 'first', 'US', 'Ambassador', 'Vietnam', 'political', 'relations', 'were', 'restored', 'specifics', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Leo', 'Thorsness', 'F-105', 'pilot', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'winner', 'was', 'not', 'profiled', 'was', 'considerably', 'more', 'impressed', 'John', 'McCain', 'viewing', 'documentary', 'previously', 'had', 'been.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'liked', 'biographies', 'men', 'profiled', 'making', 'feature', 'was', 'amazed', 'amount', 'cooperation', 'freedom', 'filmmakers', 'received', 'government', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'impressed', 'fact', 'Pete', 'Peterson', 'man', 'imprisoned', 'Hanoi', 'six', 'years', 'was', 'appointed', 'accepted', 'Ambassadorship', 'Vietnam', '1997', 'Truly', 'ability', 'humans', 'heal', 'forgive', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'film', 'better', 'other', 'can', 'recall', 'indomitable', 'nature', 'human', 'spirit']",N/A

I just check at the website and Eber reviewed this with somebody named Norman Mark, and they both gave this two thumbs up. But I believed that the person who he did it with didn't liked it.

I heard nothing of permanent damage.  There was a brief section on what the wives experienced.  I don't remember anything on the diet of the POW's.  I never knew that there had been at least one escape (for which the recaptured POW's and remaining POWs paid dearly).  I would have liked to know how many POW's died in prison.
