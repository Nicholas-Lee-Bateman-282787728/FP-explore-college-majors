Thomas Howell and Tom Arnold. However, I've never seen the actor before who plays the lead role, and he definitely does NOT look like a tough guy action hero...come on! At the end of the movie he brags, ""I got into shape""...standing there on the beach with a soft physique and a big gut, and no tan whatsoever. In the first half of the movie, he looks like a bum on the street, and in the second half, he looks like a computer geek. And this hot chick bartender who can get any guy she wants is all over him in both versions of his appearance? Yeah, right. So he can play Nocturne in E flat--big deal.

1461239,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B005HS00WI,G. Teslovich,"[0, 4]","Reasons to not waste one's time:(1.) This Kiosk rental rating is less than one because it's not worth the dollar it cost to rent.(2.) IMDB rating was 2.3 out of 10.(3.) Most of the actors, writer and director have to their filmography credits either movies no one's ever heard of or lots of TV videos and shorts you've never heard of.(4.) First 20 minutes consisted of some guy driving around and then getting out to then walk around with a cheap camera and take pictures. That's it.(5.) The editing and cinematography were so bad I thought a high school student was practicing on creating a collage for art class. Poor editing, very choppy, no flow and when it did have flow it would barely beat out molasses flowing across a winter Canadian prairie.(6.) Acting, was this artificial, e.g. stare at the person in front of you and read a line then camera pans to that person who reads their line, and back and forth ad nauseam. You would have sworn their was a teleprompter off screen. Also seeing that Tom Arnold was a main character, poor soul, didn't help.(7.) Most parts of the story were just not believable: e.g. recently dug grave doesn't have grass above it and looks like the decades old surrounding grass; some guy is tossed into the ocean with feet and hands bound with heavy chains and head in a hood while his captors are still above him in a boat yet he manages to escape from them. Must be those fish gills we didn't see. Then for revenge he spends a year getting in shape, practicing martial arts and pistol range shooting to come back and kill dozen or so highly trained killers. Unfortunately he looked like the same skinny, beer belly non-athletic person that he was before the training. The worst part was seeing an equally middle aged out of shape Tom Arnold act like a Marine sharp shooter and nail three bad guys perfectly from a mile away. His most remarkable shot, for some unexplained reason, occurs when he's in a bumpy rent-a-copter with a very shaky rifle. Just laughable.(8.) Overloaded with uncreative stereotypes such as inept police; crooked police; business that does some drug dealing on the side which supports the mansion of the son who wants to take over dad's business; cute blond girlfriend who works in the local pub; the usual few innocent people die (poorly explained reasons) as appetizers.",1,Kiosk Rating &lt;1,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,2333,"['Reasons', 'not', 'waste', 'one', 'time', '1', 'Kiosk', 'rental', 'rating', 'less', 'one', 'not', 'worth', 'dollar', 'cost', 'rent.', '2', 'IMDB', 'rating', 'was', '2.3', '10.', '3', 'Most', 'actors', 'writer', 'director', 'have', 'filmography', 'credits', 'movies', 'one', 'ever', 'heard', 'lots', 'TV', 'videos', 'shorts', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'of.', '4', 'First', '20', 'minutes', 'consisted', 'guy', 'driving', 'around', 'then', 'getting', 'out', 'then', 'walk', 'cheap', 'camera', 'take', 'pictures', 'it.', '5', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'thought', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'was', 'practicing', 'creating', 'collage', 'art', 'class', 'Poor', 'editing', 'very', 'choppy', 'flow', 'when', 'did', 'have', 'flow', 'would', 'barely', 'beat', 'out', 'molasses', 'flowing', 'winter', 'Canadian', 'prairie.', '6', 'Acting', 'was', 'artificial', 'e.g', 'stare', 'person', 'front', 'read', 'line', 'then', 'camera', 'pans', 'person', 'who', 'line', 'back', 'forth', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'would', 'have', 'sworn', 'was', 'teleprompter', 'off', 'screen', 'Also', 'seeing', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'poor', 'soul', 'did', ""n't"", 'help.', '7', 'Most', 'parts', 'story', 'were', 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'e.g', 'recently', 'dug', 'grave', ""n't"", 'have', 'grass', 'decades', 'old', 'surrounding', 'grass', 'guy', 'tossed', 'ocean', 'feet', 'hands', 'heavy', 'chains', 'head', 'hood', 'captors', 'are', 'still', 'boat', 'yet', 'escape', 'Must', 'be', 'fish', 'gills', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Then', 'revenge', 'year', 'getting', 'shape', 'practicing', 'martial', 'arts', 'pistol', 'range', 'shooting', 'come', 'back', 'kill', 'dozen', 'so', 'highly', 'trained', 'killers', 'Unfortunately', 'looked', 'same', 'skinny', 'beer', 'belly', 'non-athletic', 'person', 'was', 'training', 'worst', 'part', 'was', 'seeing', 'equally', 'middle', 'aged', 'shape', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'act', 'Marine', 'sharp', 'shooter', 'nail', 'three', 'bad', 'guys', 'perfectly', 'mile', 'away', 'most', 'remarkable', 'shot', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'when', 'bumpy', 'rent-a-copter', 'very', 'shaky', 'rifle', 'Just', 'laughable.', '8', 'Overloaded', 'uncreative', 'stereotypes', 'such', 'inept', 'police', 'crooked', 'police', 'business', 'drug', 'dealing', 'side', 'mansion', 'son', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'dad', 'business', 'cute', 'blond', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'local', 'pub', 'usual', 'few', 'innocent', 'people', 'die', 'poorly', 'explained', 'reasons', 'appetizers']",Restitution
1461240,AUI702QTNKN1E,B005HS00WI,movie lover,"[3, 3]","Recently I watched the Postman Always Rings Twice.  A classic thriller but flawed.  I believe this is as good a film as that classic film in many ways.  The main character looks pretty shaggy for a reason as later in the film when he is reborn he isn't recognized as his former self even by his short lived girlfriend.  I didn't recognize him either.  I'm not sure but I think his nose was longer and wider before he shaved his beard off and cut his hair short.The main character is supposed to be doing work for a lawyer who hired him to video tape people suspected of insurance fraud.  But the real purpose is to frame him for their murders and edit his video to include scenes of the people dieing so it appears he taped his victims while he murdered them.  The video tape is in the hands of the police and when he disappears he is considered the killer without ever having been tried for the crime.But the real murderers dump him into the lake with his hands and feet in chains and he managed to escape.  We don't find that out until close to the end of the film when he reveals himself to us.Tom Arnold's character is a little over the top for a former marine sniper who lives next door to the writer who rents the condo for the summer.  The writer is the friend of the accused missing murderer he said and he is investigating the crimes his friend was accused of commiting.  The closer he looks the more danger he is in and people began to die when they speak to him.  The writer turns out to be the man who was framed.The final scenes are our hero killing the bad guys and revealing the truth about drug smuggling, murder and why he was framed for the murders all the while freeing the former girlfriend held hostage.We have a drug smuggling son of a rich man and a host of conspirators including a doctor, and two dirty police detectives.  The main problems I have with the film are that the girlfriend wouldn't recognize her former lover's voice.  One thing he can't disguise is his voice.  The other is where did a down and out man accused of murder acquire so much money in just a year if he is forced to use a false identity and hiding from the police.  He's loaded with cash.  Lastly, how can Tom Arnold afford to live so well in such a nice condo?  There is no mention of him ever working or having any source of income.  But he drives a high powered car and lives well.  No explanation is needed for us I guess.The final shootout in an expensive home and neighborhood brings a sole corrupt detective when the silent alarm goes off.  But often a security company would notify the police of a silent alarm and then patrol officers would answer the call, not a detective.  He wouldn't even be aware unless someone called him privately.  Then Tom Arnold saves our hero by shooting the bad guy from an FBI helicopter with a sniper rifle but the amount of time it took for him to line up the shot our hero would already be dead.With a few minor tweeks this could have been a far better film.Movies like the Count of Monte Cristo where a man is seeking revenge is also a good story but with some better twists and a character who changes his appearance to keep people from recognizing who he is.  But his former lover does recognize him in that story in spite of his disguise.",4,A Pretty Well Done Film with a few Flaws,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,3284,"['Recently', 'watched', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'A', 'classic', 'thriller', 'flawed', 'believe', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'classic', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'main', 'character', 'pretty', 'shaggy', 'reason', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'reborn', ""n't"", 'recognized', 'former', 'self', 'even', 'short', 'lived', 'girlfriend', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'think', 'nose', 'was', 'longer', 'wider', 'shaved', 'beard', 'cut', 'hair', 'short.The', 'main', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'work', 'lawyer', 'who', 'hired', 'video', 'tape', 'people', 'suspected', 'insurance', 'fraud', 'real', 'purpose', 'frame', 'murders', 'edit', 'video', 'include', 'scenes', 'people', 'dieing', 'taped', 'victims', 'murdered', 'video', 'tape', 'hands', 'police', 'when', 'considered', 'killer', 'ever', 'having', 'been', 'tried', 'crime.But', 'real', 'murderers', 'dump', 'lake', 'hands', 'feet', 'chains', 'managed', 'escape', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'close', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'us.Tom', 'Arnold', 'character', 'little', 'top', 'former', 'marine', 'sniper', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'writer', 'who', 'condo', 'summer', 'writer', 'friend', 'accused', 'missing', 'murderer', 'said', 'investigating', 'crimes', 'friend', 'was', 'accused', 'commiting', 'closer', 'more', 'danger', 'people', 'began', 'die', 'when', 'speak', 'writer', 'out', 'be', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'framed.The', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'hero', 'killing', 'bad', 'guys', 'revealing', 'truth', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'murder', 'why', 'was', 'framed', 'murders', 'while', 'freeing', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'held', 'hostage.We', 'have', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'son', 'rich', 'man', 'host', 'conspirators', 'including', 'doctor', 'two', 'dirty', 'police', 'detectives', 'main', 'problems', 'have', 'film', 'are', 'girlfriend', 'would', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'former', 'lover', 'voice', 'One', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'disguise', 'voice', 'other', 'where', 'did', 'down', 'man', 'accused', 'murder', 'acquire', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'just', 'year', 'forced', 'use', 'false', 'identity', 'hiding', 'police', 'loaded', 'cash', 'Lastly', 'how', 'can', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'afford', 'live', 'so', 'well', 'such', 'nice', 'condo', 'mention', 'ever', 'working', 'having', 'source', 'income', 'high', 'powered', 'car', 'well', 'explanation', 'needed', 'guess.The', 'final', 'shootout', 'expensive', 'home', 'neighborhood', 'sole', 'corrupt', 'detective', 'when', 'silent', 'alarm', 'off', 'often', 'security', 'company', 'would', 'notify', 'police', 'silent', 'alarm', 'then', 'patrol', 'officers', 'would', 'answer', 'call', 'not', 'detective', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'aware', 'someone', 'called', 'privately', 'Then', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'hero', 'shooting', 'bad', 'guy', 'FBI', 'helicopter', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'amount', 'time', 'took', 'line', 'up', 'shot', 'hero', 'would', 'already', 'be', 'dead.With', 'few', 'minor', 'tweeks', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'film.Movies', 'Count', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'where', 'man', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'also', 'good', 'story', 'better', 'twists', 'character', 'who', 'appearance', 'keep', 'people', 'recognizing', 'who', 'former', 'lover', 'recognize', 'story', 'spite', 'disguise']",Restitution
1461241,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B005HS00WI,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[1, 4]","I had ordered this title since it was getting some major coverage in the distributor magazines, plus I am always looking for a director to finally get that break and make a good film (especially since his last three were so bad). And add into it that Monterey Media was giving it their listing, I went into this really wanting to like it...so with sad hesitation I must say this was a good looking film that in the end I could barely watch.The story follows an author as he pursues big city corruption and a simultaneous murder frame of his good (and now dead) buddy. Tom Arnold plays the comic relief/sniper neighbor, Mena Suvari the hot girlfriend (highlight of the movie) and several other recognizable faces in forgettable roles.I really do not want to harp on this too much as I support independent film wholeheartedly, but when the acting, writing, cheesy lines, pulled punches and no-way moments keep getting thrown at you in almost every sequence - you almost want to give up. I made it to that clich&eacute;d and moronic ending, hoping to then find some redemption in the one supplement. The making-of is a 20-minute director's commentary on top of irritating handheld behind the scenes footage. So you do get to hear about how the film was made but I prefer to get that in an actual commentary. The fly-on-the-wall filming of several scenes would have been more fun to watch if you could hear what was going on instead of the director droning.The video clarity is outstanding and they obviously had some nice cameras to work with, but the sound was dubbed so poorly at times it became laughable (really bad punching sounds, dialogue blatantly not matching the actor's mouth, made-for-TV-score music, etc). The 5.1 was intermittent, region 1 coded, rated R for violence and one bedroom scene. I cannot recommend it, but if you are looking for a light Sunday evening rental to see one of your favorite actors that might be in this, I am sure the disappointment won't be that bad...but this really felt like a thrown together crime farce.
