Its about a boy whos grandmother tells his stories about witches who come after children..Even though its supposed to be for kids, i dont recommend it for anyone under .. say, about 13. Its up to you personally, but i showed it to my neice and the scenes with the witches chasing after the kids and attacking them was quite scary for her. It also scared her when one of the witches pushes a baby down the cliff..And i dont think thats suitable for little children to watch as it can be quite frightening. For older children who can understand its just a movie then its fine.. its a good movie otherwise. Actors were good, especially the little boy he is adorable and plays his character well. The witches are scary enough for their roles and theres Rowan Atkinson who is always fun to watch.Good movie overall, but i suggest adults watch it first or supervise their kids when the little ones watch it.",3,Good movie.. probably not so much for kids,1231459200,"01 9, 2009",2009,1045,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'i', 'was', '6th', 'grade', 'i', 'think..', 'watching', '9', 'years', 'later', 'made', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'really', 'children', 'boy', 'whos', 'grandmother', 'stories', 'witches', 'who', 'come', 'children..Even', 'supposed', 'be', 'kids', 'i', 'dont', 'recommend', 'anyone', '..', 'say', 'about', '13', 'up', 'personally', 'i', 'showed', 'neice', 'scenes', 'witches', 'chasing', 'kids', 'attacking', 'was', 'quite', 'scary', 'also', 'scared', 'when', 'one', 'witches', 'baby', 'down', 'cliff..And', 'i', 'dont', 'think', 'thats', 'suitable', 'little', 'children', 'watch', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'frightening', 'older', 'children', 'who', 'can', 'understand', 'just', 'movie', 'then', 'fine..', 'good', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'Actors', 'were', 'good', 'especially', 'little', 'boy', 'adorable', 'character', 'well', 'witches', 'are', 'scary', 'enough', 'roles', 'theres', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'who', 'always', 'fun', 'watch.Good', 'movie', 'overall', 'i', 'suggest', 'adults', 'watch', 'first', 'supervise', 'kids', 'when', 'little', 'ones']",N/A

""The Witches"" is a decent adaptation of the book by the same name, though turning in to more of a sort of fairy tale; leaving out much of the dry humor of the book and eschews the original ending all together.Essentially, it is a story about a child named Luke who's and his grandmother who go to a hotel on holiday and end up discovering there is a conferences of witches at the hotel with a conspiracy to turn all of the children in the world in to mice.  It is definitely something that children will enjoy more than adults, but Anjelica Houston's performance as the Grand High Witch is very amusing and I am sure adults could at least enjoy that, it is a very fun ride and has some very entertaining moments (one involving a woman putting on what she believes to be perfume, but is actually the potion that turns children in to mice), moments of tension (notably when Luke is hiding in the conference room where the witches are having their meeting), and just a silly plot that kids will enjoy.  Not for very small children, it is likely they could be frightened by the witches true appearances, though I was 5yrs when I saw this and it didn't scare me, but much younger than that they might be frightened depending on the child.If you enjoy Roald Dahl adaptations or movies that have very fantastic plots this is a movie you should enjoy.God Bless ~Amy",5,A Very Fun Movie!!!,1002585600,"10 9, 2001",2001,2248,"['UPDATED', 'Weds', '8/17/11', 'edited', 'grammar', 'overall', 'poor', 'quality', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'when', 'was', 'about', '16yrs', 'remember', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'back', 'early', '90', 'somehow', 'mother', 'let', 'watch', 'why', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'was', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'anything', 'contained', 'occult', 'references', 'witches', 'somehow', 'one', 'slipped', 'cracks', 'became', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'child', 'still', 'favorite', 'day.This', 'adaption', 'children', 'book', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', 'Matilda', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'many', 'more', 'books', 'are', 'more', 'mature', 'most', 'children', 'stories', 'contain', 'themes', 'ideas', 'are', 'usually', 'left', 'out', 'books', 'targeted', '7-10yrs', 'such', 'child', 'abuse', 'death', 'poverty', 'are', 'three', 'biggest', 'recurring', 'themes', 'have', 'found', 'books', 'Witches', 'decent', 'adaptation', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'turning', 'more', 'sort', 'fairy', 'tale', 'leaving', 'out', 'much', 'dry', 'humor', 'book', 'original', 'ending', 'together.Essentially', 'story', 'child', 'named', 'Luke', 'who', 'grandmother', 'who', 'go', 'hotel', 'holiday', 'end', 'up', 'discovering', 'conferences', 'witches', 'hotel', 'conspiracy', 'turn', 'children', 'world', 'mice', 'definitely', 'something', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more', 'adults', 'Anjelica', 'Houston', 'performance', 'Grand', 'High', 'Witch', 'very', 'amusing', 'am', 'sure', 'adults', 'could', 'least', 'enjoy', 'very', 'fun', 'ride', 'very', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'one', 'involving', 'woman', 'putting', 'what', 'be', 'perfume', 'actually', 'potion', 'children', 'mice', 'moments', 'tension', 'notably', 'when', 'Luke', 'hiding', 'conference', 'room', 'where', 'witches', 'are', 'having', 'meeting', 'just', 'silly', 'plot', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Not', 'very', 'small', 'children', 'likely', 'could', 'be', 'frightened', 'witches', 'true', 'appearances', 'was', '5yrs', 'when', 'saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'scare', 'much', 'younger', 'might', 'be', 'frightened', 'depending', 'child.If', 'enjoy', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'adaptations', 'movies', 'have', 'very', 'fantastic', 'plots', 'movie', 'should', 'enjoy.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

Strange that. I had it taped off the TV (how far we've come), and it must have been about 10 years since I last saw it, when I spotted it on DVD. I barely remembered any of it by this time, but as soon as I put it in the DVD player, I remembered it as it happened on screen. And the little girl, Erica, disappearing at the start of the film, only to appear in a painting, still gives me the chills to this day.I was quite shocked when watching the start credits, to discover Jim Henson had a hand in this. It made me look forward to it even more, especially since it was one of the last films he had a hand in, but I was disappointed to find it wasn't that impressive. A couple of mice here & there. And obviously there was Angelica Houston's transformation from plastic surgery beauty, to haggard witch. WOW! What a transformation. I was definitely scared watching the transformation as that was the bit I didn't remember. And the rest of the witches - did anyone else think they looked a bit dodgy, because they were really men in drag?!?! Hehe. You can definitely spot it on a couple of the witches, but some of them were scarily feminine.I haven't seen a lot of the Roald Dahl adaptations, only this, Matilda and I think that's it. Apparently, he wasn't impressed with the ending, as they changed it slightly from the book. Frankly, I would have been happy if they'd stayed with the book's ending. The ending they went for just didn't click.Stuart Little obviously got a few ideas from this film, if you've seen both you'll really notice it.

She's not trying to frighten the little boy, she just wants to warn him of the real dangers that lurk out in the world. See, when she was a girl, she lost one of her good friends to the evil magic of a neighborhood witch. And, after hunting them down all her life in search of the Grand High Witch, she even lost part of a finger. Actually, against the witches in this film, it's amazing that's all she lost! One fateful night, while Luke is in his grandmother's care as his parents enjoy an evening out, tragedy strikes! Luke's mom and dad are killed in a car accident. Now, Luke is left alone with his grandmother, and she is not in the best of health. When she has a diabetic attack on Luke's birthday (man, this kid has it rough!), the doctor decrees that they should take a short vacation. Off Luke and Grandmother go, to a grand, luxurious hotel in England. But the bad luck continues, as the Grand High Witch is holding her annual Witches' Convention in the same hotel at the same time! Witches from all over the world are running about the hotel in disguise, and if you don't catch the purple glint in their eyes, you'll never know who they are!Angelica Huston plays the Grand High Witch, who has an evil plot to change all the world's children into mice with tainted candy bars. With her suitcase full of money and her tiny bottles of potion, she will send each of her witches to a different city, where they'll each open up a candy store and let the horror begin! A tubby little boy named Bruno is also staying at the hotel and is the first victim of the evil trick when The Grand High Witch uses him as a demonstration for the others. Luke witnesses the whole thing, and so they immediately change him as well. Now, it's up to these two little mice to stop the Witches from leaving the hotel and carrying on with their wicked plan! But, being a mouse in a huge hotel full of people is hard enough without having to worry about ""The Witches!""""The Witches"" is a wonderful, though somewhat scary family film for Halloween or anytime! The Roald Dahl story is enchanting, and the whole portrayal of the witches was horrifyingly excellent! This is the way I like to see Witches on film! Long noses, ugly faces, and pure evil, like in Hocus Pocus and the Wizard of Oz! These are frightening Halloween witches the way I always envisioned them as a kid, and I wish we'd get to see more films with witches like this, including out and out horror films! The first half had the makings of a great horror film in the tradition of legendary studios like Hammer and Amicus, and I would have loved to have seen such a movie, but I still love ""The Witches"" for what it actually is: Grade-A Family Horror. I would have LOVED to have seen some good sequels at least. The casting of Angelica Huston was perfect, the mood and atmosphere was brilliant, especially the opening back story, and Jim Henson's work was masterful, as usual. A healthy dose of comedy is thrown in as well, most notably thanks to Mr. Bean himself, Rowan Atkinson! Everyone should own a copy of this film, though be warned that it IS frightening for little kids, but it also teaches some good lessons on avoiding strangers bearing gifts and candy.Now, for some reason, family films are frequently released in ""Full Screen"" only.

Spells are cast. Grandson and grandmother team up to fight the evil witches by stealth.This film does not admit to being a fairy-tale, but sets out to convince you everything is true; creating believablilty. Thus, this is not a movie for small children under 10-years of age. Though, if your children have attended government-school; they have probably experienced more frightening things.Angelica Huston plays the seemingly attractive and vivacious Chief-Witch, but appearances are deceiving.Intriguing story, plenty of action, and a good ending.

Her dark bold features make her the natural as beauty in public, but inwardly hideous in true witch form.

It has a great fairytale quality to it with the classic Ronald Dahl dark edge.  It's just scary enough to keep it exciting for adults but not so much so that it ceases to be fun or really scare children.  The witches are hideous, yes, but most of the scary things and real danger are implied.  Even so, the opening with Luke's grandmother explaining to him the lore of witches and of the unfortunate disappearance of a childhood friend named Erika, is riveting and there isn't even a witch in that sequence.  That's because the actress playing Luke's grandmother is superb, as is her old nemesis, the Grand High Witch, played perfectly by Angelica Houston.  In another scene, a witch tries to lure Luke down from a tree house in a way that is creepy and threatening but never in a way that's directly confrontational or harmful.  It's like the genius of never actually seeing the shark in Jaws.  Your imagination can come up with things far scarier than could ever be put on screen.  That's part of the magic of The Witches.  It's a film that gives you that feeling of creepy danger when the Child Catcher appears for the first time in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and tries to lure the children away with candy.  It's that sinister quality hidden with a smile that works so effectively for both adults and children in The Witches.In a world full of fake looking computer generated images (CGI) in film, it's a delight to see how realistic Jim Henson's effects are in this story, even 23 years later.

The movie is well crafted with awesome special effects for the year it was made and Jim Henson's mouse puppetry is convincing. However I was disappointed by the DVD in several ways.  First of all the sound was just awful especially with the Norwegian, British, and er High Grand Witch accents.  To compound matters there is no close captioning of any kind on the disc so the viewer needs to be in a quiet room and listen very carefully.  Needless to say the the DVD is also devoid of any special features.As to the story I actually found the first part quite disturbing for a ""family film"".  Luke's loving Norwegian grandmother tells him an awful story of a childhood friend who was imprisoned in a painting by a witch until her  eventual ""disappearance"" in old age and the story is so realistically enacted it is really quite sad and  chilling.  Grandma also shows him the scar where her little finger was before an encounter with a witch and gives him some warning advice as to how to recognize the creatures.  The next morning Luke and his grandmother learn Luke's parents have both been killed in an accident.  Shortly after Grandma Helga comes down with a serious case of diabetes and she and Luke leave for a vacation at an English seaside village.At their vacation hotel they run into a convention of witches and this more surreal part of the story is actually more light hearted and comical despite some intense scenes.  The filmmakers give a happy contrived ending to the story unlike what Roald Dahl wrote in the novel.  I usually strongly object to filmmakers altering such major plot points but Helga and Luke had suffered so much earlier in the film I was glad to see them experience some joy.

It has that same sort of quirky black humor and mild creepiness that that more famous story has.  The story concerns a boy named Luke whose parents are killed in an accident and he goes to live with his grandmother Helga.  Early on there is a rather terrifying encounter with a witch and Luke's grandmother certainly knows a thing or two about them.Helga decides to take Luke on a holiday to a posh British hotel where Luke makes friends with another boy named Bruno who has some rather snooty and preoccupied parents.  Sharing the hotel is group of women there for a convention of the society for the prevention of cruelty towards children, or something to that effect.  In reality, they are a coven of very ugly witches who wear masks to make themselves look human.  Indeed the site of these hairless, huge nosed, witches without their masks may not be for very little ones as the makeup is very effective and chilling.  The witches are led by their Grand High Witch played deliciously over-the-top by Angelica Huston.  In reality the group is planning to turn all the children of England into mice with a magic potion.The boys catch wind of the plan and find themselves turned into mice.  But they can still think and talk and eventually get back to Luke's Grandmother where they hatch a plot to turn the tables on the witches, setting the stage for a rather gruesome, but humporous climax.  Without the use of any sort of Modern CGI the effects and makeup team did a very good job with the witches and the transformations into mice...especially when the characters were in mid-transformation.  Rowan Atkinson is along to add some comedy as the hotel's restaurant manager.Like Willy Wonka, it's a family film with some possible cautions for very young kids who may possibly be frightened by the Witches.

What I'm going to ""review"" is the availability of the movie and the full 16:9/widescreen transfer.The movie had previously only ever been released on home video in ""fullscreen"" (4:3 or 1.33:1 ratio). Both the VHS and DVD releases have only ever had the fullscreen format. A widescreen VHS, LaserDisc or DVD was never released, in any country. The only way to have viewed the complete widescreen version of the film was if you got to see it in theaters when it was released.Even subsequent airings on HD television channels seem to play a butchered version of the 4:3 cut, further cut from the top and bottom for the illusion of widescreen. What you got was a twice-butchered version (first, the fullscreen version is missing video from the left and right, THEN, the HDTV version cuts data from the top and bottom of the fullscreen version to make a fake-widescreen transfer).So call me skeptical when Amazon Video claimed the movie was available in widescreen. I bit the bullet and viewed it.The Amazon Video version, I can confirm, is the full 16:9 release of the film. In both SD and HD resolutions!As of this review, the movie is available to stream for free if you have a Prime subscription. It is also available to purchase or rent on Amazon Video. If you want to watch it on your TV, a Roku box, PlayStation3 or Xbox 360 can achieve this. You can also watch it on your iPad with the Amazon Prime Video app (sadly not available for iPhone or iPod Touch yet).The digital release also exists on iTunes and Vudu, but I cannot confirm if they are truly the widescreen version (though it's likely, as Amazon, Apple and UltraViolet probably get their digital release from the same source).The movie is not yet available on Blu-Ray disc, and they're likely not going to release an updated DVD, which means that for now the only way to watch the full 16:9 transfer of the movie is digitally. It's also not available on Netflix, so consider this one an Amazon/iTunes/Vudu exclusive.",5,"The fabled widescreen transfer is now available, digitally at least",1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,2029,"['love', 'movie', 'are', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'What', ""'m"", 'going', 'review', 'availability', 'movie', 'full', '16:9/widescreen', 'transfer.The', 'movie', 'had', 'previously', 'only', 'ever', 'been', 'released', 'home', 'video', 'fullscreen', '4:3', '1.33:1', 'ratio', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'releases', 'have', 'only', 'ever', 'had', 'fullscreen', 'format', 'widescreen', 'VHS', 'LaserDisc', 'DVD', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'country', 'only', 'way', 'have', 'viewed', 'complete', 'widescreen', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'got', 'see', 'theaters', 'when', 'was', 'released.Even', 'subsequent', 'airings', 'HD', 'television', 'channels', 'seem', 'play', 'butchered', 'version', '4:3', 'cut', 'further', 'cut', 'top', 'bottom', 'illusion', 'widescreen', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'twice-butchered', 'version', 'first', 'fullscreen', 'version', 'missing', 'video', 'left', 'right', 'THEN', 'HDTV', 'version', 'cuts', 'data', 'top', 'bottom', 'fullscreen', 'version', 'make', 'fake-widescreen', 'transfer', '.So', 'call', 'skeptical', 'when', 'Amazon', 'Video', 'claimed', 'movie', 'was', 'available', 'widescreen', 'bit', 'bullet', 'viewed', 'it.The', 'Amazon', 'Video', 'version', 'can', 'confirm', 'full', '16:9', 'release', 'film', 'SD', 'HD', 'resolutions', 'review', 'movie', 'available', 'stream', 'free', 'have', 'Prime', 'subscription', 'also', 'available', 'purchase', 'rent', 'Amazon', 'Video', 'want', 'watch', 'TV', 'Roku', 'box', 'PlayStation3', '360', 'can', 'achieve', 'can', 'also', 'watch', 'iPad', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Video', 'app', 'sadly', 'not', 'available', 'iPhone', 'iPod', 'Touch', 'yet', '.The', 'digital', 'release', 'also', 'iTunes', 'Vudu', 'can', 'not', 'confirm', 'are', 'truly', 'widescreen', 'version', 'likely', 'Amazon', 'Apple', 'UltraViolet', 'probably', 'get', 'digital', 'release', 'same', 'source', '.The', 'movie', 'not', 'yet', 'available', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', ""'re"", 'likely', 'not', 'going', 'release', 'updated', 'DVD', 'now', 'only', 'way', 'watch', 'full', '16:9', 'transfer', 'movie', 'digitally', 'also', 'not', 'available', 'Netflix', 'so', 'consider', 'one', 'Amazon/iTunes/Vudu', 'exclusive']",N/A
108490,AUTBHG6070SL4,0790740885,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[10, 22]","This movie is certainly aimed at kids, but you might want to think hard about whether it's right for you and yours.The plot has lots of promise. The evil witches conspire to turn every child in England into a mouse. Before the plot is carried out, Luke (the small boy in the lead role) discovers it and is mouse-ified. Despite his reduced state, he and his Grandma win against them in the end. Or is it the end - there are lots more witches to take care of ...Anjelica Huston does a lovely, campy job as the Grand High Witch, the arch-baddy with some vaguely germanoid accent. Mai Zetterling also does a good job as the warm-hearted Grandma, who just happens to like a cigar now and then. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters were on the weak side. Even Luke (Jasen Fisher, at age nine or ten in this movie), wasn't good for much more than occasional goofy looks. For me, though, Jim Henson's contribution was the real disappointment - it was barely there, only a few brief scenes, plus some mouse puppets. I've liked his other work, I liked the bits that were here, and I would have liked this movie more if it had more Henson in it. Despite what the ad copy says, this isn't really for Henson fans.Although the movie is generally kid-safe, there are a few points you might want to weigh in terms of your own little ones. Early on, Luke's parents die, but he does have that loving grandmother to fall back on. There is some agression (but no violence) against kids here, but with a happy ending. There are also one explicit and a few implicit moments of violence against small animals - even as an adult, I found that one scene distasteful. Some kids will ride out such things quite happily, and you know yours best.On the whole, there's really nothing wrong with this movie. A lot more could have been right with it, though.//wiredweird",3,Anjelica Huston - over the top,1118793600,"06 15, 2005",2005,1843,"['movie', 'certainly', 'aimed', 'kids', 'might', 'want', 'think', 'hard', 'right', 'yours.The', 'plot', 'lots', 'promise', 'evil', 'witches', 'conspire', 'turn', 'child', 'England', 'mouse', 'plot', 'carried', 'Luke', 'small', 'boy', 'lead', 'role', 'mouse-ified', 'reduced', 'state', 'Grandma', 'win', 'end', 'end', 'are', 'lots', 'more', 'witches', 'take', 'care', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'lovely', 'campy', 'job', 'Grand', 'High', 'Witch', 'arch-baddy', 'vaguely', 'germanoid', 'accent', 'Mai', 'Zetterling', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'warm-hearted', 'Grandma', 'who', 'just', 'like', 'cigar', 'now', 'then', 'Unfortunately', 'rest', 'characters', 'were', 'weak', 'side', 'Even', 'Luke', 'Jasen', 'Fisher', 'age', 'nine', 'ten', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'much', 'more', 'occasional', 'goofy', 'though', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'contribution', 'was', 'real', 'disappointment', 'was', 'barely', 'there', 'only', 'few', 'brief', 'scenes', 'mouse', 'puppets', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'other', 'work', 'liked', 'bits', 'were', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'had', 'more', 'Henson', 'what', 'ad', 'copy', ""n't"", 'really', 'Henson', 'movie', 'generally', 'kid-safe', 'are', 'few', 'points', 'might', 'want', 'weigh', 'terms', 'own', 'little', 'ones', 'Early', 'Luke', 'parents', 'die', 'have', 'loving', 'grandmother', 'fall', 'back', 'agression', 'violence', 'kids', 'here', 'happy', 'ending', 'are', 'also', 'one', 'explicit', 'few', 'implicit', 'moments', 'violence', 'small', 'animals', 'even', 'adult', 'found', 'one', 'scene', 'distasteful', 'kids', 'will', 'ride', 'out', 'such', 'things', 'quite', 'happily', 'know', 'yours', 'whole', 'really', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'though.//wiredweird']",N/A
