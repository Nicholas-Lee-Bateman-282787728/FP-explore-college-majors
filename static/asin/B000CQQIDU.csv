961076,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000CQQIDU,Andrew Ellington,"[17, 19]","When I first saw `Domino' I was in love.  I must admit that I adore Tony Scott's directing style.  I remember when I first saw `Man on Fire', I was just blown away by the way Scott could capture your attention so effortlessly.  I am a huge fan of his brother Ridley (one of our finest working directors) and while I feel Ridley is the finer director, Tony is working his way up their on his own terms.  So to get back to my initial statement, when I first saw `Domino' I was smitten, or in love, whatever I said at first.  Upon repeated viewings though, I have found that the film, while fun and explosive and utterly irresistible, is not without flaws; quite a few to be honest.`Domino' tells the fictionalized story of real life bounty hunter Domino Harvey.  Former model and daughter of a famous actor, Domino lived a life of prestige and glamour but she desired something a little more gritty.  She resented her money and prominence and wanted to escape it as quickly as possible.  When by chance she received an opportunity to do so, she took it, and thus joined bounty hunters Ed and Choco.Quite possibly the only part of this movie that is true is the fact that Domino Harvey was a real person.  More of the story could be based on actual events (I use the word `could' strongly here) but it really doesn't matter much.  Whether it's true or not is not the issue.  Even the film itself tells you before it begins that this is `sort of' the truth, and we as the audience can appreciate that.  This is a way for Scott to pay homage to a friend and he does so with guts and bravado.  There is no denying that `Domino' is an exciting visual feast and delivers a good time.There is a problem though with the manic style in which Scott tells this story.  It may not be true, but it should still at least be understandable, and while I'm not saying that the story is impossible to `get' I am saying that it takes a lot out of you to follow it coherently.  The film is all over place in most parts, jumping time frames, repeating itself, stuttering, changing direction, jumping back, shifting focus; delivering large amounts of information at once and then going back and changing its mind on us.  If you focus your attention you'll get it, but if you are not one who is used to having to really pay close attention you'll find yourself lost, and once you're lost you won't be able to find your way back.  `Man on Fire' is a little more controlled, a film that uses the visual flare Tony Scott is known for but with restraint so as not to take away from the impact of the film.To quote Mena Suvari's character; this film ""has the attention span of a ferret on crystal meth.""The plot development is a little overly complicated at times, so much so that it causes me to question Scott's decision to simplify Domino's initiation into the world of bounty hunting.  He takes a lot of time to develop this twisted and intricate DMV scam but skimps on showing us how Domino became the bounty hunter that she was (I highly doubt it was as easy as the film makes it seem).A major highlight to the film though is the acting on the part of the entire cast.  Keira Knightley and Mickey Rourke had a great year in 2005.  They both gave award winning performances (Knightley in `Pride and Prejudice' and Rourke in `Sin City'), and Knightley even went on to garner an Oscar nomination.  Here they excel at playing the character they are given.  Knightley gives Harvey heart, and she manages to engage the audience and get us invested in her.  Rourke creates a father figure for Domino, but never waters him down.  He's still rough and gruff and extreme.  Edgar Ramirez does a great job as Choco, the bounty hunter after Domino's heart, and Delroy Lindo is his usual fantastic self as Claremont, Domino's boss.  The cast is extensive and serves us memorable performances by everyone from Mo'Nique (her Jerry Springer scene alone is unforgettable) to 90210 stars Ziering and Green (who do a stand up job of digging into their own celebrity).True, `Domino' could have been a little cleaner, but then again, maybe that would have taken away from the impact Scott was going for.  I would have liked to have seen Scott use a little more restraint with his style and delivered something a little more heavy hitting like `Man on Fire' (possibly his best film) and I would have liked to have seem a little more though gone into fleshing out these characters a little morel; but in the end I can't really complain too much.  `Domino' is fun and exciting and engaging and serves up a deliciously violent good time.  It's not perfect, but no one asked it to be.",3,Fully equipped with the attention span of a ferret on crystal meth...,1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,4633,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'Domino', 'was', 'love', 'must', 'admit', 'adore', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'directing', 'style', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Man', 'Fire', 'was', 'just', 'blown', 'away', 'way', 'Scott', 'could', 'capture', 'attention', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'brother', 'Ridley', 'one', 'finest', 'working', 'directors', 'feel', 'Ridley', 'finer', 'director', 'Tony', 'working', 'way', 'up', 'own', 'terms', 'So', 'get', 'back', 'initial', 'statement', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Domino', 'was', 'smitten', 'love', 'said', 'first', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'have', 'found', 'film', 'fun', 'explosive', 'utterly', 'irresistible', 'not', 'flaws', 'quite', 'few', 'be', 'honest.', 'Domino', 'fictionalized', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'Former', 'model', 'daughter', 'famous', 'actor', 'Domino', 'lived', 'life', 'prestige', 'glamour', 'desired', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'gritty', 'resented', 'money', 'prominence', 'wanted', 'escape', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'When', 'chance', 'received', 'opportunity', 'do', 'so', 'took', 'thus', 'joined', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'Ed', 'Choco.Quite', 'possibly', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'true', 'fact', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'was', 'real', 'person', 'More', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'use', 'word', 'could', 'strongly', 'here', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'true', 'not', 'not', 'issue', 'Even', 'film', 'sort', 'truth', 'audience', 'can', 'appreciate', 'way', 'Scott', 'pay', 'homage', 'friend', 'so', 'guts', 'bravado', 'denying', 'Domino', 'exciting', 'visual', 'feast', 'delivers', 'good', 'time.There', 'problem', 'manic', 'style', 'Scott', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'should', 'still', 'least', 'be', 'understandable', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'story', 'impossible', 'get', 'am', 'saying', 'lot', 'follow', 'coherently', 'film', 'place', 'most', 'parts', 'jumping', 'time', 'frames', 'repeating', 'stuttering', 'changing', 'direction', 'jumping', 'back', 'shifting', 'focus', 'delivering', 'large', 'amounts', 'information', 'once', 'then', 'going', 'back', 'changing', 'mind', 'focus', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'get', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'used', 'having', 'really', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lost', 'once', ""'re"", 'lost', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'Man', 'Fire', 'little', 'more', 'controlled', 'film', 'visual', 'flare', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'known', 'restraint', 'so', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'impact', 'film.To', 'quote', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'character', 'film', 'attention', 'span', 'ferret', 'crystal', 'meth', 'plot', 'development', 'little', 'overly', 'complicated', 'times', 'so', 'much', 'question', 'Scott', 'decision', 'simplify', 'Domino', 'initiation', 'world', 'bounty', 'hunting', 'lot', 'time', 'develop', 'twisted', 'intricate', 'DMV', 'scam', 'skimps', 'showing', 'how', 'Domino', 'became', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'was', 'highly', 'doubt', 'was', 'as', 'easy', 'film', 'seem', '.A', 'major', 'highlight', 'film', 'though', 'acting', 'part', 'entire', 'cast', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'had', 'great', 'year', '2005', 'gave', 'award', 'winning', 'performances', 'Knightley', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Rourke', 'Sin', 'City', 'Knightley', 'even', 'went', 'garner', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Here', 'excel', 'playing', 'character', 'are', 'given', 'Knightley', 'Harvey', 'heart', 'engage', 'audience', 'get', 'invested', 'Rourke', 'father', 'figure', 'Domino', 'never', 'down', 'still', 'rough', 'gruff', 'extreme', 'Edgar', 'Ramirez', 'great', 'job', 'Choco', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Domino', 'heart', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'usual', 'fantastic', 'self', 'Claremont', 'Domino', 'boss', 'cast', 'extensive', 'memorable', 'performances', 'everyone', ""Mo'Nique"", 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'scene', 'alone', 'unforgettable', '90210', 'stars', 'Ziering', 'Green', 'who', 'do', 'stand', 'up', 'job', 'digging', 'own', 'celebrity', '.True', 'Domino', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'cleaner', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'away', 'impact', 'Scott', 'was', 'going', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Scott', 'use', 'little', 'more', 'restraint', 'style', 'delivered', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'heavy', 'hitting', 'Man', 'Fire', 'possibly', 'best', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seem', 'little', 'more', 'gone', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'little', 'morel', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'Domino', 'fun', 'exciting', 'engaging', 'up', 'deliciously', 'violent', 'good', 'time', 'not', 'perfect', 'one', 'asked', 'be']",N/A

Instead of going with its own style, it tries instead to repeat what another film had already done. Tony Scott, who also directed Man on Fire, doesn't seem to have any range when it comes to directing action flicks.That being said, I will say that the story, once it plays out to its fullest, is surprisingly good. You just have to get past the constant jump-cuts from past, present, and future in order to fully determine what is happening. Too add to that, the character of Domino Harvey is based off of a real-life bounty hunter of the same name. Though it's obvious that the story in this movie is completely false, the beginnings of Domino's life as represented in the movie is true: she was indeed a model unhappy with her rich life, her father was an actor, her mother was a model, and she loved excitement. After that gets out of the way, Domino sort of changes into a heist movie dominated by guns, beautiful women, and a lot of curse words.Other bonuses include some great action sequences and some edgy dialogue, not to mention Keira Knightley to all the male fans out there. The DVD bonuses are good, as well, with a documentary about the true Domino Harvey, who died during the making of this film. Still, these bonuses don't exactly make this a worthwhile movie.

961080,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B000CQQIDU,Beau Yarbrough,"[0, 5]","Once upon a time, Tony Scott took a script by a then-unknown auteur named Quentin Tarantino and gave us the hyperkinetic, color-drenched True Romance. While it never got the raves of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, it was, in its own way, a great film.Fast forward more than a decade, and Scott reaches for that same bottle that once contained the lightning and tries to drink from it a second time. This time around, he has once again assembled a who's who of actors (including Christopher Walken, who had a memorable scene in True Romance facing down some very unhappy mobsters), cranks up the color and hyper-kinetic style and ... doesn't quite end up with a great film.A good film.A fun film.But not a great film.The problem is the script. While Tarantino's scripts appear to careen wildly back and forth, they actually have a great deal of structure and he's a disciplined writer who knows where he's going and only includes what's needed to get there, even if he enjoys faking the audience out about the final destination.Domino, instead, ultimately becomes fairly flabby and overly long and it suffers the one fatal flaw such a film should never have: There are moments where it's simply boring.Having said that, it's a film worth seeing.

It is very much a post-Fight Club and Natural Born Killers film, and the film editing  felt very much influenced by the latter, though grittier and more realistic, and was shot with very subdued colors. The script, by Richard Kelly of Donnie Darko fame, was certainly something I was looking forward too, and feels strange as a follow-up to the somewhat flawed but undoubtably entrancing Darko. It is disappointing in the sense that following his previous innovation, he seems to break no new ground. While a fair majority of the college audience I saw the film with laughed and cheered their way through the film, I found the film's humor to be strikingly out of place at times. Perhaps simply as a script it flows in a more sensible manner, but with the film being edited as it was, I felt constantly unsure as to what this film was supposed to be, or what it was trying to accomplish. The ending only further elicited this response from me; the film's almost maniac insiatance on this gritty whirlwind style leaves almost no room for the viewer to develop any sense of identity with any of the characters, or really to even know them at all. As a result the sacrifices at the end of the film are hollow and empty (as they tend to be in most hollywood blockbusters). One begins to wonder if Richard Kelly feels at all like Tarantino felt when Oliver Stone made as much of a mess as he could out of Tarantino's far superior Killers script. To see how to make a movie vastly enjoyable and flashy at the same time, check out tarantino's Kill Bill.

On paper this looked like a can't miss action flick that boasted an all star cast with the likes of Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Delroy Lindo, Lucy Liu, Christopher Walken & Jacqueline Bisset. However this one did miss; and it missed badly.The film starts off on a very strong note with Domino's back story and how she came to be part of team of celebrity bounty hunters. But half way through, the movie splinters and suddenly a masked gang steals the contents of an armored car, and before long a mob boss, a group of college students, two former ""Beverly Hills 90210"" stars, a crazed TV producer, the FBI, a bail bondsman and a terminally ill child are all got caught up in this crazy situation, which culminates in a Las Vegas casino.Sounds exciting right? Well it isn't.  The action and pacing is so bizarre and disjointed that you walk away never really knowing what happened or why. I was so thoroughly disappointed in this movie, because I have come to expect so much more from a director like Tony Scott. Maybe the real problem is that I was expecting something else.

961090,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000CQQIDU,Chris Kennison,"[3, 6]","Domino Harvey! She was the daughter of a supermodel and legendary actor Laurence Harvey (Manchurian Candidate). She was given the life of a privileged girl, but was tomboyish and rebellious in nature. She was an unwilling sorority girl. Moonlighted as a runway model herself. She loved knives, shurikens and especially guns. But, more than anything, wanted to give back to the community and make it more peaceful and livable. She just wanted to help and to everyone's surprise, wanted to be a bounty hunter and not just any bounty hunter, but a bounty hunter in the most dangerous part of California. She wanted to go where the action was... so she says. A woman, who was so void of pride that she was shocked that somebody was interested in her life and wanted to make a movie about it. And a woman, who during the filming of the movie, at the highlight of her life, when she was excited about the production of her story, died suddenly of an unexpected heart attack in her bathtub.Sounds like a great story, and it is. In fact, it's an incredible story. Sounds like a potentially great movie, and it should have been. You see, the above account of Domino Harvey's life is not included in the film. Instead, the creators of the movie DOMINO, decided to write up a FICTIONAL ACCOUNT that was based loosely on the life of Domino Harvey, basically telling the story of a female bounty hunter named Domino that is being questioned about missing millions from a job her and her partners were on.The best part of the DVD is a 20-minute featurette that actually tells the TRUE story of Domino Harvey. Where she came from? Why she did what she did? Interviewed her mother, partners and friends, and told us how she led her life and how she left us too soon.The movie, on the other hand, does none of this, and in my opinion, did the story of Domino Harvey, ZERO justice. That's an understatement. I'm being kind. In short, the makers of DOMINO dropped the ball, miscalculated horribly and unfortunately, took an INCREDIBLY PROMISING TRUE STORY and made one of the worst movies of the year.The creators of DOMINO made a hyperactive, FICTIONALIZED, Pulp Fictionish, flash-image, MTV style, gritty, gratuitous, over-the-top action film that blows up buildings and throws severed arms as if they came from a Michael Bay film school, in an effort to appease the most immature of film viewers.Besides, I don't know why Tony Scott insists on his herky-jerky MTVish, don't sit on a shot longer than 5 seconds, constantly dusk style of shooting. It is the same style that was used in MAN ON FIRE and G.I. JANE.  I didn't like it those movies and I like it even less here. It's disjoining, unappealing and confusing.Not to mention, if you're trying to make something look realistic... this doesn't work.  Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin used to say that they didn't want edits when they did their stunts, because people would think that they weren't really doing it... and they were right.  In Domino... you get 10-15 edits a minute.Domino Harvey's story is still worthy of being told, even though the creators of the movie DOMINO thought it would be better if they made up 90% of it. Hopefully someday, somebody will do her story justice, keep it real, and do a REAL MOVIE ABOUT HER LIFE, and not some story that was concocted by a Hollywood screenwriter who thought her story wasn't good enough.Besides, her story is yet to be told...",1,DOMINO HARVEY: a true story not done justice,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,3421,"['Domino', 'Harvey', 'was', 'daughter', 'supermodel', 'legendary', 'actor', 'Laurence', 'Harvey', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'was', 'given', 'life', 'privileged', 'girl', 'was', 'tomboyish', 'rebellious', 'nature', 'was', 'unwilling', 'sorority', 'girl', 'Moonlighted', 'runway', 'model', 'loved', 'knives', 'shurikens', 'especially', 'guns', 'more', 'anything', 'wanted', 'give', 'back', 'community', 'make', 'more', 'peaceful', 'livable', 'just', 'wanted', 'help', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'wanted', 'be', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'not', 'just', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'most', 'dangerous', 'part', 'California', 'wanted', 'go', 'where', 'action', 'was', 'so', 'A', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'void', 'pride', 'was', 'shocked', 'somebody', 'was', 'interested', 'life', 'wanted', 'make', 'movie', 'woman', 'who', 'filming', 'movie', 'highlight', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'excited', 'production', 'story', 'died', 'suddenly', 'unexpected', 'heart', 'attack', 'bathtub.Sounds', 'great', 'story', 'fact', 'incredible', 'story', 'potentially', 'great', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'see', 'above', 'account', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'life', 'not', 'included', 'film', 'Instead', 'creators', 'movie', 'DOMINO', 'decided', 'write', 'up', 'FICTIONAL', 'ACCOUNT', 'was', 'based', 'loosely', 'life', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'basically', 'telling', 'story', 'female', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'named', 'Domino', 'being', 'questioned', 'missing', 'millions', 'job', 'partners', 'were', 'on.The', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', '20-minute', 'featurette', 'actually', 'TRUE', 'story', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'Where', 'came', 'Why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'Interviewed', 'mother', 'partners', 'friends', 'told', 'how', 'led', 'life', 'how', 'left', 'too', 'soon.The', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'none', 'opinion', 'did', 'story', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'ZERO', 'justice', 'understatement', ""'m"", 'being', 'kind', 'short', 'makers', 'DOMINO', 'dropped', 'ball', 'miscalculated', 'horribly', 'unfortunately', 'took', 'INCREDIBLY', 'PROMISING', 'TRUE', 'STORY', 'made', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'year.The', 'creators', 'DOMINO', 'made', 'hyperactive', 'FICTIONALIZED', 'Pulp', 'Fictionish', 'flash-image', 'MTV', 'style', 'gritty', 'gratuitous', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'film', 'up', 'buildings', 'throws', 'severed', 'arms', 'came', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'film', 'school', 'effort', 'appease', 'most', 'immature', 'film', 'viewers.Besides', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'herky-jerky', 'MTVish', 'do', ""n't"", 'sit', 'shot', 'longer', '5', 'seconds', 'constantly', 'dusk', 'style', 'shooting', 'same', 'style', 'was', 'used', 'MAN', 'ON', 'FIRE', 'G.I', 'JANE', 'did', ""n't"", 'movies', 'like', 'even', 'less', 'here', 'disjoining', 'unappealing', 'confusing.Not', 'mention', ""'re"", 'trying', 'make', 'something', 'look', 'realistic', ""n't"", 'work', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'used', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'edits', 'when', 'did', 'stunts', 'people', 'would', 'think', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'doing', 'were', 'right', 'Domino', 'get', '10-15', 'edits', 'minute.Domino', 'Harvey', 'story', 'still', 'worthy', 'being', 'told', 'even', 'creators', 'movie', 'DOMINO', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'made', 'up', '90', '%', 'Hopefully', 'someday', 'somebody', 'will', 'do', 'story', 'justice', 'keep', 'real', 'do', 'REAL', 'MOVIE', 'ABOUT', 'HER', 'LIFE', 'not', 'story', 'was', 'concocted', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'thought', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough.Besides', 'story', 'yet', 'be', 'told']",N/A

If movies actually were pop songs, ""Domino"" would be a nightmarishly awful cover of ""Bohemian Rhapsody.""It's the heavily fictionalized tale of Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley), the real life daughter of actor Laurence Harvey, who turned her back on Beverly Hills and became a bounty hunter.

Substitute the word ""you"" for the movie Domino and maybe deserve sounds too harsh but that's how it feels to me. There's plenty to like in the film but then it does other things that almost ruin it. I say ruin it because this is one of those kind of films where it's fine as what it is but what could've been kind of goes through your mind.The film is based on the true story...kinda, as it says in the opening, about Domino Harvey, daughter of actor Lawrence Harvey. She's a bit troubled as she's into anti-anything almost and carries around a pair of nunchukus with which she's quite skilled. She falls in with Ed and Choco, 2 bounty hunters and inexplicably they become stars of a reality tv show. The main issue the 3 have to deal with is 10 million stolen from a hotel owner and plus we have an issue with a Las Vegas as well as the FBI.While Keira Knightley doesn't exactly scream bad*** bounty hunter, she's actually really great and is able to balance an emotional aspect as well as being a tough-as-nails chick. Normally actors who try to be a bit more adult and aggressive almost look unintentionally funny, like a kid who dresses up as a ninja for Halloween. There's also Mickey Rourke playing off his Sin City comeback as Ed, Christopher Walken as a TV producer and even Ian Ziering and Brian Austin Green as the reality show hosts.Where the problem hits is with the MTV-style editing. It's like the camera can't sit still for 10 seconds without being jettisoned off somewhere with camera trickery or image fadeouts and it kind of robs certain scenes from any emotional impact. There's 2 things that are often repeated, that of echoed dialogue as well as Domino's mantra of ""heads you live, tails you die"". Both are fine and don't appear much but you still wish they didn't have it so much. The only real scene that shows off the hyper-kinetic style is a big hotel shootout which easily beats the one in Smokin Aces but not as good as Tony Scott's own True Romance shootout. Oh well, close enough.The pacing though is nicely handled as there's a lot of story to get through without getting too slow but when the story is filled with double crosses are believed-to-be double crosses, it might make your head confused. There's at least some comic relief provided by the 90210 boys and I always love how Rourke says god**** for some reason. The film as a whole though is strangely accessible like even though you may not like the style of the film, there seems to be enough to make it watchable and most films don't even have that.If you were expecting anything less from Tony Scott, well that's your own fault. Known for Days of Thunder and Deja Vu, this is the kind of film you'd expect from someone like him: it's frantic, frenetic and maybe a bit schizophrenic but there's something watchable about the whole mess.",3,I have no clue what I just saw...,1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,2999,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'watched', 'first', 'movie', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', ""'d"", 'know', 'quote', 'like', 'less', 'half', 'half', 'as', 'well', 'deserve', 'Substitute', 'word', 'movie', 'Domino', 'maybe', 'deserve', 'sounds', 'too', 'harsh', 'how', 'plenty', 'like', 'film', 'then', 'other', 'things', 'almost', 'ruin', 'say', 'ruin', 'one', 'kind', 'films', 'where', 'fine', 'what', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'kind', 'mind.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'kinda', 'opening', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'daughter', 'actor', 'Lawrence', 'Harvey', 'bit', 'troubled', 'anti-anything', 'almost', 'around', 'pair', 'nunchukus', 'quite', 'skilled', 'Ed', 'Choco', '2', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'inexplicably', 'become', 'stars', 'reality', 'tv', 'show', 'main', 'issue', '3', 'have', 'deal', '10', 'million', 'stolen', 'hotel', 'owner', 'have', 'issue', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'as', 'well', 'FBI.While', 'Keira', 'Knightley', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'scream', 'bad***', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'actually', 'really', 'great', 'able', 'balance', 'emotional', 'aspect', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'tough-as-nails', 'chick', 'Normally', 'actors', 'who', 'try', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'adult', 'aggressive', 'almost', 'look', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'kid', 'who', 'up', 'ninja', 'Halloween', 'also', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'playing', 'off', 'Sin', 'City', 'comeback', 'Ed', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'TV', 'producer', 'even', 'Ian', 'Ziering', 'Brian', 'Austin', 'Green', 'reality', 'show', 'problem', 'MTV-style', 'editing', 'camera', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'still', '10', 'seconds', 'being', 'jettisoned', 'off', 'somewhere', 'camera', 'trickery', 'image', 'fadeouts', 'kind', 'robs', 'certain', 'scenes', 'emotional', 'impact', '2', 'things', 'are', 'often', 'repeated', 'echoed', 'dialogue', 'as', 'well', 'Domino', 'mantra', 'heads', 'live', 'tails', 'die', 'are', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'much', 'still', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'so', 'much', 'only', 'real', 'scene', 'hyper-kinetic', 'style', 'big', 'hotel', 'shootout', 'easily', 'one', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'own', 'True', 'Romance', 'shootout', 'Oh', 'well', 'close', 'enough.The', 'pacing', 'though', 'nicely', 'handled', 'lot', 'story', 'get', 'getting', 'too', 'slow', 'when', 'story', 'filled', 'double', 'crosses', 'are', 'believed-to-be', 'double', 'crosses', 'might', 'make', 'head', 'confused', 'least', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', '90210', 'boys', 'always', 'love', 'how', 'Rourke', 'god****', 'reason', 'film', 'whole', 'though', 'strangely', 'accessible', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'style', 'film', 'be', 'enough', 'make', 'watchable', 'most', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'that.If', 'were', 'expecting', 'anything', 'less', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'well', 'own', 'fault', 'Known', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'kind', 'film', ""'d"", 'expect', 'someone', 'frantic', 'frenetic', 'maybe', 'bit', 'schizophrenic', 'something', 'watchable', 'whole', 'mess']",N/A

I was floored by the art on the screen.  The acting was spot on and the directing by Tony Scott was freaking amazing.  I love his work to begin with, the constant stop and go, rewind, repeat work going on, the green overtones in the color giving the film this gritty horror-show feeling.  I was in heaven.  This movie is not by anymeans a TRUE story, more like a fabrication of a real event.  Domino (Keira Knightley) was born into riches.  Her father was a famous actor who died while she was very young.  Her mother soon sent her to bording school in order to pursue her road to more riches.  Domino became a model while still overseas before her mother moved her to Beverly Hills, land of the stars.  Domino didn't fit in with the other girls.  She was a tough cookie if you want to say that.  She soon decided, upon seeing an add for a bounty hunter class, that she had a purpose.  She ""wants to have a little fun"" and fun she has when she teams up with hunters Ed Mosbey (Rourke in a kick@$$ role) and his partner Choco (Edgar Ramirez)...  She soon earns herself recognition as bounty hunter of the year and such and is then ofered the op. to have her story told on TV with a reality TV show entitled ""Bounty Squad"" where a camera crew along with 90210 stars Ian (pronounced I-an, not E-an) Ziering and Brian Austin Green as the hosts.  It goes well until the mob gets involved and it just becomes a big mess, people die, limbs are lost, dogs are killed and then theres the acid trip of a sex scene in the middle of the desert (real hot!) anyways, this film is brilliant, and I just hope and pray that a film like this will get the attention it deserves.  Its a notch above the rest and deserves a vote or two...I mean come oscar time wouldn't it be nice to see a violent, bloody, sexy, gritty film like Domino take home an award, and I don't me in art direction or costume design...if it were up to me Keira and Mickey would be up for Best female in lead and Best male in supporting, but it's not up to me which means it most likely won't happen.",5,Acid trip worth taking,1129593600,"10 18, 2005",2005,2189,"['was', 'anticipating', 'worst', 'walking', 'film', 'got', 'such', 'awful', 'reviews', 'movie', 'notch', 'rest', 'really', 'was', 'floored', 'art', 'screen', 'acting', 'was', 'spot', 'directing', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'was', 'freaking', 'amazing', 'love', 'work', 'begin', 'constant', 'stop', 'go', 'rewind', 'repeat', 'work', 'going', 'green', 'overtones', 'color', 'giving', 'film', 'gritty', 'horror-show', 'feeling', 'was', 'heaven', 'movie', 'not', 'anymeans', 'TRUE', 'story', 'more', 'fabrication', 'real', 'event', 'Domino', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'was', 'born', 'riches', 'father', 'was', 'famous', 'actor', 'who', 'died', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'mother', 'soon', 'sent', 'bording', 'school', 'order', 'pursue', 'road', 'more', 'riches', 'Domino', 'became', 'model', 'still', 'overseas', 'mother', 'moved', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'land', 'stars', 'Domino', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'other', 'girls', 'was', 'tough', 'cookie', 'want', 'say', 'soon', 'decided', 'seeing', 'add', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'class', 'had', 'purpose', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'fun', 'when', 'teams', 'up', 'hunters', 'Ed', 'Mosbey', 'Rourke', 'kick', '@', 'role', 'partner', 'Choco', 'Edgar', 'Ramirez', 'soon', 'recognition', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'year', 'such', 'then', 'ofered', 'op', 'have', 'story', 'told', 'TV', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'entitled', 'Bounty', 'Squad', 'where', 'camera', 'crew', '90210', 'stars', 'Ian', 'pronounced', 'I-an', 'not', 'E-an', 'Ziering', 'Brian', 'Austin', 'Green', 'hosts', 'well', 'mob', 'involved', 'just', 'big', 'mess', 'people', 'die', 'limbs', 'are', 'lost', 'dogs', 'are', 'killed', 'then', 'acid', 'trip', 'sex', 'scene', 'middle', 'desert', 'real', 'hot', 'film', 'brilliant', 'just', 'hope', 'pray', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'attention', 'notch', 'rest', 'vote', 'two', 'mean', 'come', 'oscar', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'violent', 'bloody', 'sexy', 'gritty', 'film', 'Domino', 'take', 'home', 'award', 'do', ""n't"", 'art', 'direction', 'costume', 'design', 'were', 'up', 'Keira', 'Mickey', 'would', 'be', 'up', 'Best', 'female', 'lead', 'Best', 'male', 'supporting', 'not', 'up', 'most', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen']",N/A

961103,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B000CQQIDU,David R. Eastwood,"[1, 3]","The basic plot features of this film have been adequately covered by numerous other reviewers, and it seems to be largely a matter of personal taste that has caused the wide range of ratings. Most of those who dislike it seem to find it an interesting film, and I would like to plug the bonus materials that come with this DVD: the brief biopic of the REAL Domino Harvey is worth viewing in itself AND as a basis for understanding what the director and writer were attempting; the commentary tracks are also very informative (which is often not the case); deleted scenes can be viewed by themselves or with commentary.The film is framed with an interrogation--similar to that in THE USUAL SUSPECTS, but with a different outcome. The violence is well choreographed--similar to the KILL BILL films. The plot twists are often unexpected, yet fairly plausible--unlike MR. & MRS. SMITH. The drug scene is amazingly well presented--like that in one of the YOUNG GUNS films.And, in a way, it's a sweet film: partly as a kind of Valentine to the real-life Domino Harvey, who had a bit-part in the film and who died just before it was released, and partly as a strong reminder that many people need help with their problems. Indeed, the plot of this fictionalized account of Domino Harvey's life seems to have been constructed to show us what the proper treatment of our fellow human being should be--especially when they are unlucky, suffering children.",4,INTERESTING--AND EVEN SWEET IN A WAY,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,1445,"['basic', 'plot', 'features', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'adequately', 'covered', 'numerous', 'other', 'reviewers', 'be', 'largely', 'matter', 'personal', 'taste', 'caused', 'wide', 'range', 'ratings', 'Most', 'who', 'dislike', 'find', 'interesting', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'plug', 'bonus', 'materials', 'come', 'DVD', 'brief', 'biopic', 'REAL', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'worth', 'viewing', 'basis', 'understanding', 'what', 'director', 'writer', 'were', 'attempting', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'informative', 'often', 'not', 'case', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'commentary.The', 'film', 'framed', 'interrogation', 'similar', 'USUAL', 'SUSPECTS', 'different', 'outcome', 'violence', 'well', 'choreographed', 'similar', 'KILL', 'BILL', 'films', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'often', 'unexpected', 'yet', 'fairly', 'plausible', 'MR.', 'MRS.', 'SMITH', 'drug', 'scene', 'amazingly', 'well', 'presented', 'one', 'YOUNG', 'GUNS', 'films.And', 'way', 'sweet', 'film', 'partly', 'kind', 'Valentine', 'real-life', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'who', 'had', 'bit-part', 'film', 'who', 'died', 'just', 'was', 'released', 'partly', 'strong', 'reminder', 'many', 'people', 'need', 'help', 'problems', 'Indeed', 'plot', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'constructed', 'show', 'what', 'proper', 'treatment', 'fellow', 'human', 'being', 'should', 'be', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'unlucky', 'suffering', 'children']",N/A
961104,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000CQQIDU,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[2, 7]","There are only three kinds of people in the world: those that liked ""Domino"", those that hated ""Domino"", and those that prefer watching ""Flightplan"" instead of this film (the weirdos).  I, other hand, embraced being on column A.- REVIEWWith a title like ""Domino"", this would have been a perfect negative remark to use, like ""it all falls down like a domino should.""  However, unlike most of the people here, I think this movie is very good.  It's insane and completely chaotic, and I loved every single bit of it, because the movie knows it's trying to be chaotic.  Some people says the gruesome content in this movie is too much for sensitive mothers, but let me tell you: I went to see this movie at a theater with my mother and aunt, and they loved it!  They were having a fun time with this movie, even more than me I have to say.  True story, y'all.What's not so true of a story is ""Domino"", which is LOOSELY based on the real Domino Harvey's life.  In fact, the only true thing in this movie, like ""The Truman Show"", is the main character herself; everything else is fictional.  I mean, how else can you explain all those crazy situations that should've been periled for bounty hunters like Domino (played by Keira Knightly), Choco, and the boss, Ed.  Besides Domino's bio, it's hard to explain the plot of the story; 25% of the time, I let it flow, but 85% of the time I'm thinking, ""WTF?"" (I know it equals to 110%, so deal with it.)  I know it has something to do with these four things: millons in cash, the mafia, a reality show, and Jerry Springer; believe me, that's how these strange things fused together to create trouble.For the anime enthusiastic, think of this film as ""Mezzo"" meets ""FLCL"".  Yep, this movie is THAT crazy.Director Tony Scott obviously goes to the School of Oliver Stone, because he likes this somewhat-biopic film to be filled with the things ""Natural Born Killers"" has done: fast moving scenarios, shaky cameras, intentional poor video quality, and an amalgamation of randomized pop cultural references and social commentaries.  All of the randomness makes ""Domino"" not only violent, but very funny, if you can catch up.  I love the guest stars in this film, like Christopher Walken, who's finally in a movie that isn't a comedy and it works for him.  He plays as a director of a Domino-themed reality show for the WB, hosted by two 90210 rejects, Brian and Ian (boy, if Domino was alive right now, A&E; would've givin her a REAL reality show and coincide with ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"", calling it the ""Domino Dog Bounty Hour"").  Speaking of 90210 rejects, who doesn't laugh at the moment when Domino punches Brain Austin Green in the face, or when they whine like babies when they escaped from danger?Out of all the people in this film, my personal best has to go with Mo'Nique (finally, a role that served her justice).  She played as Lateesha who's mostly responible of all the insanity that's happening to this film, for the sake of saving her terminally-diseased granddaughter.  The hilarious Jerry Springer scene is when I started to love her (along w/ everyone else), when she starts blabbering out some new racial terms for the lexicon, such as ""Blactina"", ""Koregro"", and ""JAPANIC"" (lol)!  Hmm, I guess I must be called ""Jamanic"" then, since I'm Jamaican and Hispanic.Sure, this movie is very confusing; sure, the constant jogging camera work can give someone a serious migrane; and sure, a snail eating a banana is more cohesive what ""Domino"" has shown me.  I can't ignore these problems no matter how much I try, but overall, I had fun with this film.  Don't take this film too seriously, because you gonna lose out the entertainment value that this film has.

The movie gets comical and absurd as it goes on, but it works.  It's absurdity is well thought out and everything that is said and done gets tied back into the plot somehow.  And she even tells you as the narrator of this story that she doesn't care how much of it you believe to be fact.  I take that as a lot of it could be made up or even symbolic of what might have really happened.

961107,AHLWDWD37M0PN,B000CQQIDU,"Dragashani ""Eclectic""","[1, 2]","Domino was definitely an entertaining movie in a whacked out, Natural Born Killers kind of way.  It's sort of based on the real life story of Domino Harvey, former model turned bounty hunter.  Keira Knightley actually does a phenomenal job going from the girlie girl we're used to seeing in movies like Pride and Prejudice to tattooed, gun-toting bounty hunter.The supporting cast is incredible too, from Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez as her bounty hunting pals to Christopher Walken as a crazy television producer, to those two Beverly Hills 90210 guys Ian Ziering & Brian Austin Green appearing as themselves, a couple of washed up prima donna former teen idols.So what's the downside you're probably wondering, since I've been raving about the movie so far.  Well, here it goes.  The choppy camera work, while really well-suited to the scenes of people tripping out doesn't work as well during other parts of the story which primarily revolves around a series of flashbacks about what happened to lead Domino to be sitting at a table with an FBI agent, battered, bloody, handcuffed, and being questioned.  It feels like they tried substituting good editing with an acid trip.  Secondly, while entertaining, the storyline is kind of weak, you know it's sort of based on a true story, but most of the time you're watching you'll be saying to yourself, 'No way, that couldn't have happened.'But all in all, while never a threat as an Oscar contender, the movie entertains if you're willing to give it a chance.

961110,A3JD8FDS3CO3GH,B000CQQIDU,FairiesWearBoots8272,"[106, 124]","Imagine that before going to bed one night, you've read a magazine article about bounty hunter Domino Harvey, watched an over-the-top action movie and taken a hit of acid. Your dreams would likely resemble Tony Scott's new film, Domino. The film opens with ""This is based on a true story........ sort of"", and ""sort of"" is certainly accurate. If you're expecting a film biography of Domino Harvey, then you will certainly be disappointed with this movie. It's not a biography at all, in fact after seeing the movie you might know less about Domino Harvey than you did before. However, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Rather than delivering another dull overly reverent biopic, Tony Scott brings forth something entirely different. The movie is a mixture of fact and fiction, however there's certainly a lot more fiction than fact. Domino Harvey was a real person who was really a bounty hunter, and died earlier this year. Several other characters in the movie were based on real people. The film's plot was most likely entirely concocted for the movie, however. The fact that it was scripted by Donnie Darko writer/director Richard Kelly explains some of the craziness. I think its separation from reality is one intriguing thing about it, though. It's not supposed to be an accurate biopic, it's merely an action-crime thriller involving several real characters.Keira Knightley stars as Domino giving a boisterous, abrasive performance that is both thrilling and provocative. She manages to distance herself from her previously girlish roles in such movies as Pirates of the Caribbean and Bend It Like Beckham. Indeed my initial interest in seeing this movie was the image of Keira Knightley brandishing machine guns. How could I resist? But that's not all. You also get Mickey Rourke in full tough-guy mode as Domino's partner Ed Mosbey.And as if the prospect of Keira Knightley and Mickey Rourke as gun-wielding bounty hunters weren't enough, you also get Christopher Walken as a crazy television producer. However, the insanity doesn't stop there! Tom Waits appears as a sort of religious prophet, and Brian Austin Green and Ian Ziering of Beverly Hills 90210 star as themselves! Then, by the time the movie goes to the Jerry Springer show with Mo'Nique unveiling her new categories for racially mixed people, you wonder when the kitchen sink is going to show up. In one scene, Christopher Walken's character is described as having ""the attention span of a ferret on crystal meth,"" and that pretty much sums up the movie as a whole.It really is a crazy flick. It could be called many things. It's being called a severe case of style over substance, and that's certainly true. However whatever it is, one thing it certainly isn't is boring. There is nearly always something interesting and exciting going on onscreen. High art it's definitely not, but it is an outrageously entertaining movie. Whether or not most viewers like it will most likely depend on personal taste.Domino is already sharply dividing critics, but that's certainly understandable. If you're at all familiar with Tony Scott's work as a director, then you probably know what to expect. He's not a fan of long takes and the average length of his shots tends to be about two seconds. Domino only increases the hyperkinetic filmmaking style that he's been working on. Viewers will find this to be either enjoyable and interesting or immensely frustrating. Personally, I didn't mind. The movie only occasionally made my head hurt. Anyone with epilepsy will certainly want to stay far away.

The story is based on fact (the real Domino Harvey had a hand in the film before her death just before the film was released) and that makes it even more suspenseful.  Domino is played by Keira Knightly who more than demonstrates that she is an actress to watch.  Her involvement with fellow bounty hunters Ed Moseby (Mickey Rourke) and Choco (Edgar Ramirez) along with characters enacted by Delroy Lindo, Mo'Nique, Riz Abbasi, Dabney Coleman, Brian Austin Green, and Lucy Liu to name only a few memebers of this talented cast is on the center of the target.  There is much violence, some very amusing sequences, and lots of pyrotechnical and other action gimmicks that add to the film's flavor.But the overall success of this 'biopic' is due to Tony Scott's signature vision of visual storytelling.  It just works - but you have to surrender to the style that is evident from the opening shots in order to enjoy and appreciate this wild ride. The DVD has a lot of information about the real Domino Harvey with conversations while the crew discuss the characters and the actors portraying them in the film.  Worth a careful look.

YEO ""gyeo""","[0, 2]","Tony Scott's films have a visually unreal quality about them - they look very much like the work that he's produced back in the tv commercial world.  Explosions, slo-mos, fast cuts, silhouettes - every editing trick in the book is in this MTV flick, which moves so jarringly even on a tv screen that I wonder how people watched this on the big screen.The irony is that Domino is based on the life of a real life bounty hunter.  The cinematic stakes are pushed so high however, that it's hard to see the reality that this is based on.  The actors here are understandably but totally glamourised - so much so that the grit comes off as false.  It's typical Tony Scott gloss which is fine if that's what you're after.It would've been interesting to see how another director would've handled this as a real bio-pic, rather than as a hollywood shebang.  I thought about that as I watched the behind the scenes documentary that unveils the real Domino Harvey (to some degree), one reason to buy the DVD if you've watched and liked the film.The real Domino looks like an androgynous David Bowie from his Ziggy Stardust days.

For those who have experienced Scott's most recent films (catch a glimpse of his BMW film starring Clive Owen, Gary Oldman, and James Brown) prior to Domino, you well know that his cinematography has gotten a bit fast-paced and changes the entire movie-watching experience. But add onto that the creative screen-writing of Richard Kelly and some excellent performances by Keira Knightley and Mickey Rourke, and you've got yourself an action-packed, non-stop ride. Sometimes Domino can be a handful (the character and the movie), but it all adds to the film's tone. Even for Tony Scott fans, you may feel like he's starting to push your limit, but for me it was like I was being brought back to a little over ten years ago with a fantastic little film we all remember as True Romance. While the cinematography wasn't that of Scott's most recent, the story was just as action-packed, and filled with off-the-wall excitement. In addition, some may remember the younger-then screen-writer of True Romance; a certain Quentin Tarantino.If you're looking for a good time in the style of a classic Tony Scott film that's trippy from beginning to end, then break out the big-screen TV, warm-up the surround sound, and prepare yourself for some heart-pounding, gun-blasting showdowns.

I guess the best way to put it is as a ""blah"" film.  After it ended I had the feeling of ok well now thats over what else is on.The story itself is probably the biggest reason for this sensation.  While interesting it isn't all that compelling really.  Domino Harvey is the daughter of a wealthy actor and proper mother.  After her fathers death at a young age Domino is raised exclusively by her mother in a world of priveledge but tends to be a troublemaker or possibly a lost soul.  After moving to Beverly Hills with her mother Domino pretty much strikes out as a recluse looking for action and falls into the company of a couple scheming bounty hunters.The story is based on the real life of Domino Harvey but naturally much of the story is embellished or complete fiction with some elements retaining the true story.  Domino played by Knightley is a decent cast and only if you haven't seen the real Domino would someone believe she doesn't look the part.  Keira is a sensational young actress and doesn't disappoint.  The rest of the cast is all solid and fits their role.The biggest errors lie in the plot.  Once Domino teams up with her bounty hunter co-horts she begins a live of reckless adventure and crazy scenarios of violent encounters and reality TV.  But through a side story we are introduced to other characters trying to raise money for a granddaughters operation.  It is somewhat preachy about the nations health care system and what not.  For fear of ruining the movie I won't disclose more but what I will say is that the plot is definately not developed well.  Told through an interogation by Lucy Liu we are kind of whisked all over the place to bits and pieces of the story.  nothing wrong with an ambiguous story but when it is all laid out at the end it was pretty weak in scope.  I felt it could have been a tad more ambitious.With all that being said the film is decent with some good action sequences, humor, and of course violence.  Christopher Walken and Mena Suvari are great in their stint as are the two guys from Beverly Hills 90210 and their self-depricating ways.The cinematagraphy is wild and jerky.  Purposfully so (there is even a featurette on it in the special features) like so many other British or niche violent crime films of late.  Problem is though the acid like appearance and jerky nature of every scene actually becaomes a distraction and quite tiresome for the viewer.  If the film had more replay value then I would say this isn't an issue because you simply could watch it once to enjoy it then go back and watch it again later for more of the story.  But after the conclusion I really have no desire to go back and sit through it again.The special features are ok.  There is a documentary on the life of Domino Harvey which was interesting.  Could have been a bit longer though.  Also some director commentaries and deleted scenes which I think at least some of should have been put back in for sheer humor.All in all though the film does not warrant a purchase unless you have already seen it and have to own it.  If you have not seen the film I recommend checking it out sometime just be wary of purchasing it blind as I did.  The decent offering of special features isn't enough to bring this film up from a rent in any way.",3,A fairly unengaging film is good for a rent...,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,3434,"['hard', 'really', 'get', 'grasp', 'how', 'feel', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'satisfying', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'disappoint', 'either', 'guess', 'best', 'way', 'put', 'blah', 'film', 'ended', 'had', 'feeling', 'ok', 'well', 'now', 'over', 'what', 'else', 'on.The', 'story', 'probably', 'biggest', 'reason', 'sensation', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'really', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'actor', 'proper', 'mother', 'fathers', 'death', 'young', 'age', 'Domino', 'raised', 'exclusively', 'mother', 'world', 'priveledge', 'be', 'troublemaker', 'possibly', 'lost', 'soul', 'moving', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'mother', 'Domino', 'pretty', 'much', 'out', 'recluse', 'looking', 'action', 'company', 'couple', 'scheming', 'bounty', 'hunters.The', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'naturally', 'much', 'story', 'embellished', 'complete', 'fiction', 'elements', 'retaining', 'true', 'story', 'Domino', 'played', 'Knightley', 'decent', 'cast', 'only', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'real', 'Domino', 'would', 'someone', 'believe', ""n't"", 'look', 'part', 'Keira', 'sensational', 'young', 'actress', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'rest', 'cast', 'solid', 'role.The', 'biggest', 'errors', 'lie', 'plot', 'Once', 'Domino', 'up', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'co-horts', 'live', 'reckless', 'adventure', 'crazy', 'scenarios', 'violent', 'encounters', 'reality', 'TV', 'side', 'story', 'are', 'introduced', 'other', 'characters', 'trying', 'raise', 'money', 'granddaughters', 'operation', 'somewhat', 'preachy', 'nations', 'health', 'care', 'system', 'what', 'not', 'fear', 'ruining', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disclose', 'more', 'what', 'will', 'say', 'plot', 'definately', 'not', 'developed', 'well', 'Told', 'interogation', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'are', 'kind', 'whisked', 'place', 'bits', 'pieces', 'story', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'ambiguous', 'story', 'when', 'laid', 'out', 'end', 'was', 'pretty', 'weak', 'scope', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tad', 'more', 'ambitious.With', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'decent', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'humor', 'course', 'violence', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'are', 'great', 'stint', 'are', 'two', 'guys', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'self-depricating', 'ways.The', 'cinematagraphy', 'wild', 'jerky', 'Purposfully', 'so', 'even', 'featurette', 'special', 'features', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'British', 'niche', 'violent', 'crime', 'films', 'late', 'Problem', 'acid', 'appearance', 'jerky', 'nature', 'scene', 'actually', 'distraction', 'quite', 'tiresome', 'viewer', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'replay', 'value', 'then', 'would', 'say', ""n't"", 'issue', 'simply', 'could', 'watch', 'once', 'enjoy', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'later', 'more', 'story', 'conclusion', 'really', 'have', 'desire', 'go', 'back', 'sit', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'ok', 'documentary', 'life', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'was', 'interesting', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'longer', 'Also', 'director', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'think', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'back', 'sheer', 'humor.All', 'film', 'not', 'warrant', 'purchase', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'have', 'own', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'sometime', 'just', 'be', 'wary', 'purchasing', 'did', 'decent', 'offering', 'special', 'features', ""n't"", 'enough', 'bring', 'film', 'up', 'rent', 'way']",N/A

961124,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000CQQIDU,Jason,"[2, 2]","Domino Harvey (Keira Knightly), a dichotomy, a female bounty hunter with a modeling past, a 100lb., chain smoking, college drop out from an affluent family, a woman with an affinity for confrontation and violence.  Domino, a walking contradiction of perception and reality.  As fate would have it, she finds among wind-blown trash an ad for a bounty hunter seminar.  Chaotic and violent serendipity ensues when she joins the legendary bounty hunger Ed Moseby (Mickey Rourke) and his partner Choco (Edgar Ramirez).  Throw that dysfunctional family in a blender with a reality TV producer played by Christopher Walken, an outrageous conspiracy and robbery perpetuated by some DMV employees, action from the FBI a casino executive and the boss of a crime syndicate, and a tongue-in-cheek appearance by some former 90210 cast members, and the result is absolute brilliance.Knightly plays her role perfectly (and gets topless); it's almost believable except for her waifish appearance (she gets topless).  Edgar Ramirez is awesome, psychotic, someone who actually looks troubled enough to be in that line of work.  And Rourke is good in everything.  As long as it involves him looking like a broken down barroom brawler who slept last night in a vomit-soaked alley way after soiling himself after a fight that he lost.  The rest of the cast is stellar, and there is just enough star power and gravitas (e.g. Delroy Lindo, Lucy Liu, Mena Suvari, Dabney Coleman, Jacqueline Bisset) to carry sidebars and subplots.Story-wise, the majority is about Domino and her partners' rise to fame, their connection with a deal gone bad, and their catastrophic fall from grace.  There are underlying messages about death and separation from emotion - the symbolism in goldfish being flushed down the toilet is misguided - perhaps even justice and redemption, but it's only supplementary to the awesome concept and execution of this complex and flawlessly filmed movie.  The dialogue is believable, with tons of F-bombs and shotgun-cocking bravado.  The entire film appears to have a yellowish hue, maybe a nod to the west coast or to exude some sort of emotion.  The direction is also excellent, as Tony Scott - you either like his frenetic style or you don't - ensures that the entire ride is grungy and dangerous, a step away from the grave or prison at all times.It's an amazing concept based loosely on a true story as addictive as the personalities in the movie.  A thrill ride from beginning to end, this movie has nearly everything including models, nunchucks, mescaline overdoses, bounty hunters, chinegros, Jerry Springer, reality TV, cholo lap dances, and a ferret on crystal meth.

This is a film in which arms are literally being thrown around, subtitles are correcting themselves, but I loved every minute of it. Kiera Knightley gives a fierce performance. She shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Mickey Rourke follows up his great performance in 'Sin City' with another tough-guy performance (Good to see him). Edgar Ramirez really doesn't do anything except speak Spanish every once in a while and stare at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives a good supporting performance. Mo'Nique was herself, although she did surprise me on one particular scene. Lucy Liu has great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her. Christopher Walken owns his roles as usual and an unusual assortment of actors including some Beverly Hills 90210 stars manage to squeeze themselves into this production.The problem that I had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do, instead of the character of Domino. Some of the dialog in this film was also stupid {""The rich, the poor, and everyone in between.""--uuuhh, that's not as clever as you think, filmmakers, no need to repeat it twice!) Plus the final action scene is all shaky so you can't really tell what's going on.Overall, I thought `Domino' was a great deal of fun. Due to the over the top nature and the twitchy camera tricks, it's easy for me to see why the film was bashed by so many viewers, but I really didn't mind any of this in the least.

I could tell she was exceptional the minute I met her. She was shy, sleek, and had a wicked sense of humour, with a beautiful, sexy voice. She loved telling stories. She was so full of life. She was rebellious, but also loyal. She was unique."" - Former bounty-hunting partner Ed MartinezLike the opening scene to 'Underworld' with Kate Beckinsale as she plummits to earth with ease and assurance, so too does Kiera Knightly's 'Domino' who hits the ground with a thud - making a stance against crime and determined to shatter the corrupt minds of society any way she can. Welcome to a film in which the three year life of a bounty hunter in exposed. You're in for a ride you'll never forget.Once upon a time there must have been a time young Domino Harvey aspired to be like her famous actor father Lawrence Harvey who died in his thirties. He must have been a clear favourite to her, when faced with a selfish mother who seems somewhat superficial when you examine the rich life Domino could have led. At first she did, but then when all attempts at finding work were futile she headed in a totally different direction. One that would lead her to an early death of thirty-five. A tragic loss really it seems, when seen through the eyes of Keira Knightley, who injects an essential compassion as Domino. Someone who could have easily been a brainless Rambo type character if not handled with delicacy and finesse by Keira. Just as you might work a fragrant shampoo and conditioner through your hair, massaging it through with your fingers. You have to be delicate and subtle when trying to encapsulate a real person. I feel it is this compassion Keira displays so effortlessly that really sets her apart from any other story about a real life character. `Monster' is another film that triggers emotions in me unexpected when you consider the subject matter, which would be unheard of usually when you think of the troubling circumstances that befell many men, one year in Aileen Wuornos's life.Domino didn't even reach thirty six an age Marilyn Monroe died, and later Princess Diana. These two will never be forgotten they have become infamous. Maybe the same will happen with her.Domino Harvey got her name from an Ian Flemming James Bond novel called `Thunderball'. For interests sake here's a description of that film... Domino (Claudine Auger) - The luscious mistress of Emilio Largo (second in command of the evil SPECTRE organization), Domino seeks revenge after she discovers that Largo is responsible for her brother's brutal murder.Domino could make a brilliant comic book creation. Marvel's `Electra' troubled life in the form of Jennifer Garner comes to mind - but Domino is no `Alias'. It is her real name. 'Domino' would have looked awesome on the back of a motorcycle burning rubber along the road like 'The Terminator'. In all respects Keira is a bombshell you wouldn't be wise to play with unless you want her cool exterior to explode and leave you reeling when her pin is pulled and your cover is blown open like a door or a crevice - your soul revealed in all of it's twisted complexity. You better prey God will take mercy on your soul before it is too late. Otherwise this 'Domino' - this deceptively angelic 'Angel of Fire' will act as coy and cocky as you like, as she decides your doom, the worst scenerio being you are hit full force from multiple shells from a barrage of fiercly humiliating weaponry. No one but Keira Knightley could have played her so wonderfully. Not ever Sharon Stone who Tony Scott considered early on. The interrogation scenes are a knockout and her costume with a belt buckle of skulls and irresistible leather. Keira's body is to die for and is given respectful quick coverage. Domino could have been a model but she hated the manipulation that came with it so that life soon came to an end.It would be a very good thing that `Top Gun' director Tony Scott, knew the real life Domino Harvey, because he has really outdone himself this time. When he literally takes on the best of the best in both worlds - one being the acting world with countless well-respected actors, and the other being one vital scene with  Los Angeles' most violent outfits the 18th  Street Gang. The gang leader will be in for a real treat. A memorable lap dance for a crucial scene performed by none other then innocent young, 20 year-old actress Keira Knightly. Surrounded by other gun-wielding trigger-happy members, fans of `Analyze This' will remember the line on the cover...'YOU tell him he's time is up!' The fate of the ever beautiful and bountiful Keira Knightly rests with how she preforms. A game that starts in fun could all too soon come to an end, if Keira doesn't plan her words and moves right  All for the sake of Tony Scott who believes rightly ""You can't find faces like that in Hollywood, What they do for a living reflects in their eyes. ""They are sweet guys, but if you get on the wrong side of them, you are dead."" It's safe to say Keira has done a successful scene and there was no need for bloodshed. Men of the world rejoice! This scene will surely go down in history as the most daring and blazon scenes in Hollywood history. I wouldn't want to ask them to do the scene again. I'd do it all in one take. Just remember they have BIG GUNS.To figure out how this all began we must go back to earlier times in the 90s and see where exactly things went rectangular. `Domino' really thinks outside the box with no real linear structure but has an aura of mystery to it which is ideal and right because it isn't any of our business how her life ended. It will give us answers so just be patient. Things wont always spiral out of control. The line between truth and fiction is blurred considerably but it doesn't matter. I want to treat it like an X File, and while director Rob Bowman's follow up film to The X File movie was a `Reign of Fire', Tony Scott's rein of fire with last years hit 'Man On Fire' clearly continues with not a `Man On Fire' sequel, but an `Angel of Fire' of which Keira is the smouldering temptress. I was shocked and a little saddened by the women she had become in the final closing minutes. She must have been a bad girl but it's hard to imagine. Yet that is the brilliance of Keira Knightley. She appears to have no eyes during interrogation. That scene made me think of `The X Files' series 5 episode `All Souls' in which a girl was rendered frozen in driving rain and who appeared to have had her eyes burned out by lightening. I was dreaming of Keira by the end of this film. She said in the film Lucy Liu would. I don't know what Lucy thinks about but I certainly did. It all comes down to living life the best you can. This film was treated with the respect it deserves for both Domino and Keira. Congratulations. I would be very proud. I believe Domino was and that's how my thoughts will stay. Only now that the real 'Domino's life is over will she have crossed over to the other side. When there to find a paradise for her soul indeed needing saving with divine intervention for those still here to prevent more deaths to rise. 'Domino' should indeed top your DVD lists where you'll have plenty of opportunity to take a shower to wash away your sins without the fear of a knife carrying psycho called Norman Bates on the other side of the shower curtain ready to rip into you and eager for blood...and no one to knock down your door anymore to raid your residence and put the fear of God in you so deep you'd drown in your own sorrows. Only a pizza waiting for you or some popcorn to enjoy with your movie. Acting might be a fish-bowl existence, but it does have it's benefits providing a safer environment for people on the edge of a knife, and a wonderful outlet for anger and resentment until you reach rehabilitation. So for anyone in a unfulfilling profession, acting is always available. The door is always open. There is nothing to fear. There is no shame. The real Domino Harvey must have known the importance of actors and so it is very fortunate that the real Domino could wrap this film up and give it its book ends - because the film is as skillful as a book. Luckily she also knows about the importance of music with reference to 'The Hard Rock Cafe' leaving us all to rock out on her own tune until the music stops, and we're lulled like a lullaby into a restful sleep as the earch turns and coins rotate, may we hear ""Heads you live. Tails you die"" - Domino Harvey. Our lives are cast outstretched before us to grab hold of like hands. Our eyes will open and the sun will rise on a new day. A new life for us and new babies are born as dice roll and 'The Game of Life' begins again. We shall never truly die but live forever in films for all to enjoy. Hope and peace for everyone is gracefully restored.",5,"""Am I really that bad?"" - Lyrics to a song in the closing credits sung by the real Domino Harvey",1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,9453,"['whole',

That's probably the most accurate way to put it. Before seeing this movie, I had known nothing about this film except what I read in a short synopsis. The film was about a model named Domino Harvey, who's father had been an actor named Laurence Harvey who became an award winning bounty hunter. Then she died (I believe it was a drug overdose) while she was awaiting federal drug charges against her. So, I'm not sure how much of this film is true and personally...I don't give a f**k.I had wanted to see this movie when it came to theatres and was pushed to see it more when Quentin Tarantino named it as one of his top 5 favorite films of the year on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Scott's last film ""Man on Fire"" was the first movie I had seen by Scott that portrayed his new directing style. Which means the psychedellc, overlighted shots you see in this film. I don't mind this cinematography and it works better in this movie then it did in MOF. But, anyway...This movie was not liked by critics for the most part, although three of the most respected critics (Roger Ebert, Richard Roeper, and Peter Travers) did like it, so I was expecting just another film like ""Man on Fire"" which is entertaining the first couple times and then just gets boring.I also wasn't sure if I'd buy Keira Knightley as a bad girl. I'd already seen her do a medieval version bad girl in ""King Arthur"". But, from the first frame of this movie to the last, I loved it. This movie has a great script (no matter howt true it is), Scott's direction is in top form, and the performances are great and believable. This is probably my favorite action film of 2005, it's certainly the most entertaining. I was engrossed in this movie, glued to my seat even. It's not that the twists in this movie are good or anything, but just that it's fascinating and never boring. Anyway, here's my necessary synopsis.Knightly plays Domino. Ever since she was a little girl Domino has loathed Hollywood (and the series ""Beverly Hills 90210"") and wanted to be a rebel. Not only does she want to be, she is...And she's good at it. Eventually she attends a bounty hunter seminar and catches the attention of veteran bounty hunter Ed and his co-worker Choco (Edgar Ramirez), who speaks perfect english but thinks its cute to talk in spanish in almost every scene in the movie. The two see her at first as just a way of looking like ""two of the coolest guys in the world"" but soon she becomes a real part of the team. It is then that Domino, Ed, and Choco are assigned by their boss Claremont Williams III to track down the people responsible for stealing ten million dollars from an armored truck, which was apparently robbed by a mob bosses two children and a couple of other guys who don ex-first lady masks.Anyway, I don't want to say much more about the film except that I urge you to see it.

961139,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000CQQIDU,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 3]","Many movies make their mark on movie history by being unique in some form or fashion, allowing them to stand out and for people to take notice and say, 'hey, I remember seeing that movie, remember how original it was.'  Some ways that movies accomplish being original would be with storyline, action sequences, and cinematography.  A movie that was released in 2005 that stood out from the rest as being uniquely filmed, along with having some well-paced action sequences and a very unique storyine (mostly because it was based on a true story) would be Tony Scott's biopic ""Domino"".""Domino"" is the story of Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley), who was born into Hollywood royalty, with all the gifts and blessings that is bestowed upon those born of the rich and famous.  However, the Hollywood way of life doesn't suit young Domino, and she proceeds to quit her blossoming modeling career; instead, opting to become a bounty hunter.  Though many felt she would never last as a bounty hunter, she quickly rose to become one of L.A.'s most lethal and feared bounty hunters, and proved that you don't have to be a man to be dangerous.This movie is definitely one that stands out, especially with it's trippy visuals, wild flashes of color and different types of film stock being used throughout the entire film, a trait that director Tony Scott (""Man on Fire"" and ""Enemy of the State"") has become increasingly known for.  Scott appropriately labeled the style of cinematography as 'movie making on acid', now I've never done drugs, but I imagine that the world would probably look something like it did in this movie.  Many people felt that the trippy visuals made the movie suffer, because the flashes of light and color, along with quick editing made things feel disjointed and confusing.  I personally had no problem following the storyline, and appreciated the distinct visual style, thinking that it actually added to the originality of the movie.Along with the visual style, the storyline was original in that there really hasn't been a movie quite like this, where someone completely rejects the life of luxury in order to bring criminals to justice by any means necessary, including lap-dancing (which is a very interesting scene, in which Domino shows that she doesn't always have to turn to violence to bring a criminal to his knees) and killing if need be.  The actors really seem to be enjoying the characters they've been given, Keira is excellent as Domino, and she's surprisingly still sexy even with the nasty boyish haircut that she has to have for the role.  The supporting cast comprised of Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, Lucy Liu, and Delroy Lindo are all equally terrific in their respective roles no matter how big or small.Really when I think back on watching ""Domino"", and remembering all the complaints average viewers and critics had regarding the movie, I actually don't understand their problems with the movie.  I mean sure the visuals could be distracting if you focus solely on them, but these people that complained about ""Domino"", praised Tony Scott's previous film ""Man on Fire"" which featured many of the same visual tricks.  So, in my opinion all you critics should give ""Domino"" another chance and give it your best shot to get past the visuals and focus on the storyline and the rest of the movie in front of you.  Take it from me, ignore the critics that hated this movie, and sit down to watch an amazing story of a woman who shirked her Hollywood fortune, and made her life her own, living virtually by the flip of a coin, just like her motto states ""Heads you live, tails you die.""""Domino"" is rated R for violence, language, drug use, and sexuality/nudity.",4,"Heads You Live, Tails You Die...",1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,3697,"['Many', 'movies', 'make', 'mark', 'movie', 'history', 'being', 'unique', 'form', 'fashion', 'allowing', 'stand', 'out', 'people', 'take', 'notice', 'say', ""'hey"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'remember', 'how', 'original', 'was', 'ways', 'movies', 'accomplish', 'being', 'original', 'would', 'be', 'storyline', 'action', 'sequences', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '2005', 'stood', 'out', 'rest', 'being', 'uniquely', 'filmed', 'having', 'well-paced', 'action', 'sequences', 'very', 'unique', 'storyine', 'mostly', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'biopic', 'Domino', 'Domino', 'story', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'Hollywood', 'royalty', 'gifts', 'blessings', 'bestowed', 'born', 'rich', 'famous', 'However', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'life', ""n't"", 'suit', 'young', 'Domino', 'quit', 'blossoming', 'modeling', 'career', 'instead', 'opting', 'become', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'many', 'felt', 'would', 'never', 'last', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'quickly', 'rose', 'become', 'one', 'L.A.', 'most', 'lethal', 'feared', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'proved', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'man', 'be', 'dangerous.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'one', 'out', 'especially', 'trippy', 'visuals', 'wild', 'flashes', 'color', 'different', 'types', 'film', 'stock', 'being', 'used', 'entire', 'film', 'trait', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'Man', 'Fire', 'Enemy', 'State', 'become', 'increasingly', 'known', 'Scott', 'appropriately', 'labeled', 'style', 'cinematography', ""'movie"", 'making', 'acid', 'now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'drugs', 'imagine', 'world', 'would', 'probably', 'look', 'something', 'did', 'movie', 'Many', 'people', 'felt', 'trippy', 'visuals', 'made', 'movie', 'suffer', 'flashes', 'light', 'color', 'quick', 'editing', 'made', 'things', 'feel', 'disjointed', 'confusing', 'personally', 'had', 'problem', 'following', 'storyline', 'appreciated', 'distinct', 'visual', 'style', 'thinking', 'actually', 'added', 'originality', 'movie.Along', 'visual', 'style', 'storyline', 'was', 'original', 'really', ""n't"", 'been', 'movie', 'quite', 'where', 'someone', 'completely', 'life', 'luxury', 'order', 'bring', 'criminals', 'justice', 'means', 'necessary', 'including', 'lap-dancing', 'very', 'interesting', 'scene', 'Domino', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'turn', 'violence', 'bring', 'criminal', 'knees', 'killing', 'need', 'be', 'actors', 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'enjoying', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'Keira', 'excellent', 'Domino', 'surprisingly', 'still', 'sexy', 'even', 'nasty', 'boyish', 'haircut', 'have', 'role', 'supporting', 'cast', 'comprised', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'are', 'equally', 'terrific', 'respective', 'roles', 'matter', 'how', 'big', 'small.Really', 'when', 'think', 'back', 'watching', 'Domino', 'remembering', 'complaints', 'average', 'viewers', 'critics', 'had', 'regarding', 'movie', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'problems', 'movie', 'mean', 'sure', 'visuals', 'could', 'be', 'distracting', 'focus', 'solely', 'people', 'complained', 'Domino', 'praised', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'previous', 'film', 'Man', 'Fire', 'featured', 'many', 'same', 'visual', 'tricks', 'So', 'opinion', 'critics', 'should', 'give', 'Domino', 'chance', 'give', 'best', 'shot', 'get', 'visuals', 'focus', 'storyline', 'rest', 'movie', 'front', 'Take', 'ignore', 'critics', 'hated', 'movie', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'amazing', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'shirked', 'Hollywood', 'fortune', 'made', 'life', 'own', 'living', 'virtually', 'flip', 'coin', 'just', 'motto', 'Heads', 'live', 'tails', 'die', 'Domino', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'sexuality/nudity']",N/A

961141,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000CQQIDU,Kaya Savas,"[15, 36]","MOVIE:  Tony Scott and Ridley Scott, two brothers, different styles, great directors.  Ridley made Kingdom of Heaven early this year, and it was a flop.  I guess it was time for Tony to have a flop too.  The film is about super model turned bounty hunter, Domino Harvey. She gets into the business with Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramiraz.  Soon a tv producer played by Christopher Walken wants to make a reality show out of it.  Things go from good to bad when a few mistakes are made and a mobster thinks his sons have been killed off.  Tony Scott has an amazing visual style, I call it ""stop action camera Tony"" because what he does is use an old fashioned hand cranked camera.  That way he can over expose the light if he wants, or play with speed, and create some amazing visuals.  He used this style a little bit in Spy Game, but his last movie Man On Fire was all stop action camera Tony.  Man On Fire was a great film, there was so much substance.  Domino has none of that.  He used that style to enhance Man On Fire, and it worked on every level.  Here, he uses it just for the hell of it.  The first half of the movie has nothing to work with, a Jerry Springer sequence shown was absolutely useless and did nothing for the plot.  There is a lot of narration on behalf of Kiera Knightley, and that doesn't help.  Even Harry Gregson-Williams couldn't salvage this movie.  His scores for Spy Game and Man On Fire were brilliant, this film actually had recycled music.  In the first 10 minutes my ears picked up music from Man On Fire and Beat The Devil.  Beat The Devil was one of the BMW films that was directed by Tony Scott with music by Gregson-Williams.  Domino also takes place in Las Vegas, so did Beat The Devil.  Some of the same shots were used from Beat The Devil, and the same road where the drag race occured in Beat The Devil was used.  I mean, I've heard of  reusing great ideas and building off of them, but this is rediculous.  You'll recognize the music playing during the rave scene in Man On Fire in Domino.  The second half of the movie picks up a little bit and is okay.  Harry Gregson-Williams goes orchestral rather than techinical in the end too.  Overall, the film is a huge loud piece of nothing.  I was so excited to see some of my favorite filmmakers in action, but was left dissapointedACTING: Hey, why not recycle actors too?  Mickey Rourke was in Man On Fire, and so was Charles Paraventi.  Mickey Rourke does a good job being a bad ass, he's a great actor.  I liked him in Once Upon A Time In Mexico, Sin City, and Man On Fire.  Kiera Knightly wasn't exceptional and niether was anyone else.  Rourke stole the show, and that ain't saying much.BOTTOM LINE: A whole lotta effort for a whole lotta nothing.

(The real Domino was born in 1969, whereas you, Miss Knightley, came to us the year the Berlin Wall fell.)  It's great for you now, raking in all the parts, but what happens when you turn 25 and all the female parts start drying up for actresses no longer 19?  You'll be playing Jackie Bisset's sister next, wondering why Disney has replaced you in Pirates of the Caribbean Part Five with young Shiloh Jolie-Pitt.So the movie is a bit of a mess, and I could have lived without the repeated goldfish symbolism, and also the image of the US quarter flying into the air and coming down.  But who cares?  It's brilliant.  Don't believe the haters, for DOMINO is easily as good as TRUE ROMANCE or PULP FICTION or BAD BOYS or any of the great action classics of the past 15 years.  Mickey Rourke has had everything tucked.  He looks good.  Edgar Ramirez, even in a skimpy pair of black nylon briefs, just doesn't do it for me, give me back my Benicio Del Toro.  But give it up for Keira Knightley, she can't really cut the mustard here but she's fascinating to watch in what amounts to a vanity production for her.  Not that she's the real star.

961147,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000CQQIDU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","""Domino"" works in overdrive to be all things to all people, and as a result--it fails to be successful in almost every regard. There's great potential, to be sure, but the resultant film is a loud and convoluted mess. The movie wants to be a slick action picture AND a hip and ironic satire about Hollywood AND a procedural about bounty hunting AND a loose biopic treatment of Domino Harvey AND an edgy Tarantino type comedy. What it ultimately and unfortunately succeeds in is pointlessness. Most sadly, it is absolutely not an homage to the real, recently deceased Domino Harvey--who, by all accounts, had a fascinating story to tell. I wish this had been that movie.While I know many people enjoy this film and its excesses, I just react very negatively to it. So I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this one. To me, it represents everything that is wrong with movies today--which is especially ironic when it thinks it's poking fun at the Hollywood machine. It's addle-brained entertainment for those who expect no amount of logic or common sense in their storytelling. The actors are fine, I suppose. I can see why the role appealed to Keira Knightly and her diehard fans may want to check this out as a curiosity. There is non-stop action to appeal to the eye, and if that's all you need--it's here. But the editing, effects and music are so amped up in an attempt to make you ignore that things really never make sense.A prime example of this is the entire movie's premise! There is one crooked armored car robbery. It's an inside job, a nefarious scheme which involves Domino's direct supervisor. He is trying to illegally (and secretly) fleece a major Vegas billionaire. However, he puts Domino and her team on the case. That's fine, he'd have to act like it was business as usual. But the real kicker is that he is aware that a television reality show is filming their every movement. So, in fact, the ""secret plan"" and Domino apprehending and turning some kids over to the billionaire is all being filmed. Don't worry, though, later on our heroes will just blow up the TV van to erase the footage. Huh? Maybe they should have hired someone else. I don't know--I guess I'll never be a criminal mastermind. By the time the end rolls around, there is the requisite shoot-out with dozens of people representing four different groups. I couldn't help thinking I'd already seen this done much better in a thoroughly more entertaining film by the same director--""True Romance."" Oh, and one more thing--spare me the dead goldfish symbolism. Absolutely painful. Take a pass on this one.

Her story is nothing like *Cops* or *Dog the Bounty Hunter*.  Her adventures are fast-paced and dangerous along with her comrades, Ed (Rourke) and Choco (Ramirez).  Shadowing them is a reality TV show, which includes Brian Austin Green and Ian Ziering, former stars of *Beverly Hills 90210*.Like I said, it's fast-paced.  Action-packed.  Suspenseful.

This girl is the grand-daughter of Lateesha (Mo'Nique), a 28-year-old grandmother.  Lateesha is related to Claremont (Lindo), who runs the bounty hunting business, which includes Domino and her pals.  Can you see how messy this has already become?  Now, throw in the mob, the FBI, a reality TV crew, some friends, some thieves, a casino owner, some gun-toting bodyguards and some not-quite-innocent bystanders into the picture.

961151,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CQQIDU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","Any movie that purports to be a true story is lying right off the bat.  But that is not a problem with ""Domino"" because as soon as it informs us that it is inspired by true events director Tony Scott tosses the caveat ""sort of"" at us.  If you are expecting the true story of the late Domino Harvey, then you will be bitterly disappointed.  However, the key thing is that she would not complain, so why should we?  The woman was a professional bounty hunter and this movie makes her look good.  Scott knew the real Domino, and he has met her friends and knows what they are capable of, so her story, or rather a story about her, is in good hands.This is a kitchen sink movie in that it never goes five or ten minutes without a new twist thrown in by screenwriter Richard Kelly (""Donnie Darko"").  I suppose if you think about it in the end it all makes sense, but narrative completeness is hardly goal here.  It begins with Domino (Keira Knightley, checking out life at the other end of the universe from Elizabeth Bennett) being questioned by agent Taryn Miles (Lucy Liu), who keeps insisting she is Domino's last chance to fess up.  Whatever happened had something to do with $10 million dollars.  We go back to the beginning, when Domino, the daughter of the late actor Laurence Harvey (whose ""Manchurian Candidate"" manages to be on television a lot during this film), who is bored first by her ex-model mother (Jacqueline Bisset) and then sorority life and decides to turn her habit of playing with num-chucks into being a bounty hunter.  So she does enough to hook up with Ed Mosbey (Mickey Rourke, who might literally be turning into Marv from ""Sin City"") and Choco (Edgar Ramirez), who work for bail bondsman Claremont Williams (Delroy Lindo), and the rest is history, or a hyper-real version of the same.This is especially true once the group becomes the subject of a reality television show on the WB at the behest of Mark Heiss (Christopehr Walken).  You also have Ian Ziering and Brian Austin Green playing themselves or caricatures thereof and getting a lot more than they are giving, although clearly they have a future as celebrity hostages.  Yes, this film has celebrity hostages, and it has the mob, a showdown at a Las Vegas casino, and a harsh lesson in what happens when your cell phone reception is lousy.  There is so much thrown at you that it gets rather exhausting trying to put everything together so it makes sense, but once again: if Domino does not care, then stop trying to stress yourself out.  In suddenly some woman is talking on ""The Jerry Springer Show"" about being a ""Blacktino,"" rest assured it has something to do with the ""plot.""Besides, there is as much happening with how Scott is shooting everything that puts this movie into overdrive.  There is hand-cranking of hand-held shots, jump cuts and smash cuts, desaturated color and black & white shots, slow-motion and time lapse, and just about every thing you can think of to give the film a distinctive look.  Has any other director pulled out every single trick in the book?  Probably, but they probably did not have Keira Knightly and a big explosion.  ""Domino"" will not be everybody's cup of tea, although coffee spiked with peyote would be more in keeping with the tenor of the film.  The story line might be confusing and the cinematic style could make your head explode, but this is not a boring movie.

Another ""great"" scene is when Domino gets a house full of Mexicans with drawn guns to undraw them by giving one of them a lap dance. Hillarious!

That is badenough in a good movie but this isn't a good movie in spite of the ultra talented Kiera Knightley being in it.

Why not make a movie about the real woman?

The plot is all so convoluted, but Scott's visual flair (more similar to his work on Man on Fire than any of his previous works) helps the film pack a bloody punch.  Knightley is beautiful, alluring, and dangerous in the title role, and continues to show more promise as an actress.  The rest of the cast, including Christopher Walken, Mena Suvari, Delroy Lindo, Dabney Coleman, Jacqueline Bisset, and Lucy Liu, are all great as well.

It definitely creates a mood...which I found hard to like or admire.The cast is amazing...so many talented actors in one film: Keira Knightley, the always-gorgeous Jacqueline Bisset (whom I can never get enough of), a scary looking Mickey Rourke, Mena Suvari, Christopher Walken, Mo'nique, singer Macy Gray, Delroy Lindo, bluesy singer Tom Waits, Dabney Coleman, Lucy Liu, and the hilarious Ian Ziering and Brian Austin Green playing as ""themselves"" in striving to find work post-""90210"". They were the best thing about the film...as well as the hilarious Jerry Springer episode in which Mo'nique gives new race categories such as ""Blacktino"", ""Chinegro"" and ""Japanic"" to audience members.I wish I could give more stars to this film...but frankly, it doesn't deserve it. In the commentary track, Richard Kelly said that Hollywood studios didn't want to make this film and it was a miracle that it was even made. Considering that it bombed at the box office, I think the Hollywood studios were right. That's bad news for Richard Kelly's career trajectory. He is someone I would like to see make more films. I can't wait until ""Southland Tales"" comes out in theaters. But after that film, I hope he will make films that are more marketable. While he might think that it's selling out by making a commercial film, there are plenty of commercial films that are good quality and box office hits (""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" as an example. Was that ""selling out""?). If ""Southland Tales"" is a confusing mess as ""Domino"" is, I fear that will be the final nail on Richard Kelly's Hollywood career.

961167,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000CQQIDU,Only-A-Child,"[5, 10]","Hack Director AlertBack in 1968, at the height of his ""Star Trek"" celebrity, William Shatner got way too full of himself and released a record album called ""The Transformed Man"". It was not music in the normal sense but rather Shatner's dramatic reading of some vaguely classic literary passages set to unusual music. Two tracks were actual songs, ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" and ""Mr. Tambourine Man"", with Shatner dramatically reading the lyrics in his standard ""chewing the scenery"" manic-depressive acting style. This album is stylistically the most pompous collection in the history of sound recording. But what makes it such a prime mock fest candidate (you truly will laugh until it hurts the first time you hear either of the songs) is the total disconnect between Shatner's intensity (full of sound and fury) and the rather pedestrian lyrics (signifying nothing).I think Shatner was sincere and not simply a victim of substance abuse, although he might have benefited from a bit of sedation. This is what happens when you OD on your own delusions of grandeur.Which brings us to Tony Scott and his 2005 film ""Domino"", the first film to approach the mockfest potential of Shatner's album, and for an identical reason; the staggering capacity of hack director Scott for self-delusion. You only need examine one of the DVD's special features, the pretentiously titled ""Bounty Hunting on Acid: Tony Scott's Visual Style"". This featurette details how, like Shatner 37 years earlier, Scott suffers from a total reality disconnect and views himself as a stylistic successor to Welles and Fellini. And like the mismatch between Shatner's intensity and the quality of his material, Scott's freeze-frames, stuttering slo-mo, fast-forwards, filters, strobes, 360-degree pans, and jump cut splits simply call attention to the shallow storyline and moronic dialogue of this lame (but unintentionally hilarious) feature.Very ""loosely"" based on the life of poor little rich girl Domino Harvey, the bounty hunting daughter of actor Laurence Harvey, the film generates its best laughs if viewed as the second part of a compare/contrast double bill with the 2005 version of ""Pride and Prejudice"". That is because both feature Kiera Knightley. The comparisons showcase Scott's staggering lack of acting for the camera directing ability (he is no Joe Wright). And the lines poor Kiera must say in Domino's voice-over commentary have a vague Jane Austen flavor, like something she would have written during the last stages of Mad Cow Disease. You listen and you feel yourself getting stupider.Poor Kiera hasn't looked this silly since ""King Arthur"", where she also unconvincingly played a bratty tough-talking tomboy with clenched jaw and dour expression.The most appropriate comment I have discovered about the film is that: ""It wants your admiration desperately, like a psychedelic one-trick pony mad for a carrot"". About the only favorable thing I can say is that ""Domino"" reminded me a tiny bit of Antonioni's ""Zabriskie Point"" (1970). Of course he did it first and he did it a lot better and it was burdened with far less silly nonsense.Then again, what do I know?

It's supposed to be based on the life of a model/bounty hunter named Domino Harvey, and I'm sure there is some truth in there somewhere.The life of a bounty hunter may be exciting, and there are lots of exciting scenes with spectacular action in this flick. What I liked was the great performances by Keira Knightley and Mickey Rourke.What I didn't like was the terrible camera work. If you are high, it might seem cool, but I wasn't high while watching and the camera's repeated dizzying spinning and the quick flashes and jittery stuff wasn't working for me. I didn't need subtitles most of the time, but they were there anyhow to help me with the perfectly understandable dialogue. This movie was shot like an MTV video even though it isn't one. I think the director was trying for edgy but what he got is what I would describe as barfy. This applies especially to the scenes where everyone is high from drinking laced coffee.Another aspect of the movie I didn't like was the glorified violence. I understand that the characters the movie was loosely based on were violent and that is fine. I just ended up feeling kind of empty inside about this woman's life as portrayed through the movie.In real life, she died in a bathtub, alone, of a drug overdose. In the movie, well...it ended differently. I realize this isn't a documentary. I could have enjoyed the film.Ultimately though, I came away from it feeling robbed.

The action was exciting, loud, and irreverantly funny. Keira Knightley, my favorite beanpole actress, was brilliant in the title role. Her penchant for punching people in the nose was hilariously used as comic relief, however, she is effectively tough as nails. Mickey Rourke, the worst actor of all time, is almost unrecognizable, here, and therefore passable. His role was small, anyway. We see too much of Christopher Walken; so, thankfully, his role was also small. Under-appreciated was Edgar Ramirez, as Choco. You could read his face like a book. Brian Austin Green and Ian (that's I-a-n) Ziering, yes, of ""90210"", were used in an unusually and befitting way. It was fun to see them suffer. The use of a bloodied Keira, I mean Domino, telling her story in backflashes is not the sole territory of Quentin Tarantino. Anyone who thinks so has simply not seen enough movies. Try ""The General's Daughter"" on for size, or ""Fearless"". As one who loves to sit through the credit crawl, and see the magic bits at the end (case in point, ""Napoleon Dynamite"", among MANY others), I loved seeing the real, and lately departed, Domino Harvey. Sit through the credit crawl and see why Keira Knightley was the perfect choice to play her. In fact, always sit through the credit crawl. You can learn a lot.

The rest is made up (although at the end of the film we are warned that it's none of our business what's true and what's not).Domino was born in 1969 and her dad died in 1973.  However, the movie says he died in 1993. Domino then becomes a model, walking the catwalk. Then her mom, watching the TV show ""Beverly Hills 90210"" decides to move to California (this is apparently so that Brian Austin Green and Ian Zering can be brought into the plot).  Domino attends high school, then college. Then becomes a bounty hunter.  Any other occupations she held don't make the cut.The rest is basically a violent action movie which involves an armored heist of 10 million dollars, kidnappings, shootings, naked women, lots of smoking and gum-chewing, a shot-off arm,  a sick baby of a child mother needing a three hundred thousand dollar operation, and questionable hiring practices of California DMV's - it's easy to get hired there if you're complete scum!  It's also easy to get off work to go on Jerry Springer or commit robbery.  Well, you know the state has good benefits.Keira Knightley's cute, but she's no toughie. I just couldn't buy her as the supposedly unafraid to die Domino. Also wasn't entertained by the trite sayings: ""Heads you live, tails you die."" ""There are three kinds of people in the world - the rich, the poor, and everyone in between."" The scenes with the constantly pencil-sharpening Lucy Liu (afraid to use a pen?), the psychologist interviewing Domino throughout the film, were contrived.  There wasn't much ""how do you feel about that?"" going on, so what was the point?

These kinds of movies can be quite exciting, fasten your seatbelts its going to be a bumpy ride.Domino is one of these films for the first hour.  Domino is said to be based on a true story.

961185,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000CQQIDU,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 16]","This is a story based on truth -- Sort of.  If I remember correctly, you will see these words at the beginning of the film, and as they say, Tony Scott's new film should not be called a bio-pic.  Its terribly convoluted story is written by Richard Kelly, writer/director of cult film 'Donnie Darko' a strange film with an equally complicated plot about a troubled boy and an airplane engine falling from the sky.'Donimo' is about Domino Harvey played by Keira Knightley with a short hair.  Donimo is a daughter of actor Lawrence Harvey, also model-turned-bounty hunter who passed away this year though her sudden death has nothing to do with the film and its content.  You can see Domino herself briefly at the end credit, but Tony Scott has based his film upon largely fictional accounts on how this young British girl became a bounty hunter, and much more fictional sections about how she met her partners Ed (ultra-macho Mickey Rourke) and Choco (Edger Ramirez) in spite of the disapproval of her mother (Jacqueline Bisset).'Donimo' shows not much of actual bounty hunters' jobs, and the film's Donimo Harvey seems to have forgotten to take a test to be one.  After showing Donimo's first job as bounty hunter (with Keira's embarrasing lap-dance scenes clearly using body double), the film jumps to the year 2003.  After that point, 'Donimo' stops being a biography but a typical Tony Scott action with big actions.Now Donimo and the guys have one reality show in tow (producer played by Christopher Walken with perfect Walkenism, and assistant Mina Suvari); plus two celebrities from 'Beverly Hills, 90210' Ian Ziering and Brian Austin Green (yes, playing themselves, I'm not kidding).  Their unwise choice results in involvement in the stolen $10 million, while their bailbondsman Clairmont Willaims III (Delroy Lindo) thinks of brilliant plans about the money which turn awfully bad.  You also see Clairmont's mistress Lateesha working at DMV (Mo'Nique) gangster (Dabney Coleman), and a removed right-arm.  Oh, and I also saw Lucy Liu, Jerry Springer, Tom Waits.Sorry.  It is impossible to summerize the story, which does not matter after all.  Tony Scott is so intent on using choppy editing and subtitles busily moving on the screen, so my impression after watching this two-hour film with so many cuts, double exposures, and slanted camera with this loud soundtrack is only this -- dizzy.  There is a 'love scene' of two characters hugging on the desert which Tony Scott mercilessly ruins with rotating camera and fast cutting.  What's the point of inserting them anyway?I may offend fans of her, but it is Keira Knightley who is least successful in the film.  Certainly she swears, uses dirty words, and hold a gun too, but I could not believe that this is the Domino Harvey who did one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.  I know this is an entertaiment film, but I firmly believe that to use someone's name needs some credibility, which I couldn'd finally find in her acting.I only give two stars, but my rating means 'Domino' is not what I expected to see.  I want to see the real people in bio-pics, not an in-name-only one.

First his herky jerky film style was so out of control in this movie that it nearly made me car sick and it was annoying as hell. I really liked Man on Fire but this movie was out of control. Second the real life story of Domino Harvey as a drama would have been far more compelling and interesting as a character study than this mess. Scott takes a really interesting persons life story and takes a shred of the truth and then goes wild and turns it into some kind of overblown unreal violent trip that was just full of plot holes and didn't do the real Domino justice. They didn't go into her drug addiction at all nor her sexuality. They barely scratched the surface of her being the daughter of Lawrence Harvey or her vague and possible made up stories of being a run way or Ford model. Mickey Rourke was excellent as usual and Christopher Walken was underused. Keira Knightley did the best she could in this movie that I wanted to like so much but found myself saying ""o.k. o.k. just get to the end."" It has some entertaining scenes and performances but the direction and the story are so crappy that it was just a huge disappointment. Hopefully somebody will come out with a book or a movie about the real Domino and about her real life (unlikely since Scott bought up the rights to her story). I encourage people to read about her and find out about her on the net before you watch this. This movie did have a couple of things in it that were true. Her name was Domino Harvey. She was the daughter of actor Lawrence Harvey (The Alamo and Manchurian Candidate) and she was at one time a bounty hunter. Other than that it was just a shlock violent action flick that had no basis in truth.

961189,A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ,B000CQQIDU,Zoe Paris,"[4, 5]","I LOVE a good action movie and I thought this one ROCKED! Keira was tough yet sexy, the movie had a nice fast pace, the plot and ending were good and I think it followed the story of the real Domino fairly well (a sad story though, the special feaures on the DVD talk about the real Domino who died before the movie came out, very interesting stuff) There is never a dull moment in this movie and although they kind of Hollywood-ized the story, I still think it came out great. The dizzy acid-trip camera was a bit much at times but it WAS interesting and original the way they filmed it. Some people think it glorified violence but I don't think it does. You can't please everyone all the time. Domino is NOT a wimpy movie and not for kids or the faint of heart! Personally I thought it was an honest movie, an intense movie, it was edgy, a little sexy, had some humor and makes you think. I also feel that the true life story of the real Domino might carry a strong anti-drug and anti violence message, especially considering she died so young probably from all the stress and abuse of her body. Either way I really enjoyed this film and would watch it again and again...Especially the line where the snooty chick is giving Domino attitude and Domino asks ""Have you had a nose job?"" the girl says ""No"" and Domino punches her in the face! AWESOME! Instant classic line, especially when said in a British accent! I laughed so hard I had to watch the scene again! Overall, if you like action movies, don't mind guns, blood, guts and extreme violence, you'll LOVE this movie!",5,Have you had a nose job?
