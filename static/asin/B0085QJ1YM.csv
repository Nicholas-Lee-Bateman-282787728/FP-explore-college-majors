The perceived realities of these three individuals will result in a terrible crime, but who is the real victim? Zack Parker takes us on a twisted journey through the human psyche in his new thriller SCALENE. The events unfold from three unique perspectives as we are transported backwards and forwards in time to better understand the intentions and circumstances leading up to an apparent rape, mirroring a similar stylistic device used by Christopher Nolan in the cult thriller MEMENTO. Parker demonstrates a cautious sense of control as he begins and ends each new vignette, skillfully avoiding any contradictions in the space-time continuum that is laid out before us. By opening with the story's ending, Parker is also able to better perceive the audience's expectations, only to thwart them once the viewers have settled in on their opinions.

If you expect a taut, intellectual thriller, possibly with some action and suspense, this is not the film for you.  After watching this movie, I went back and looked at the positive reviews and noticed that 23 out of 40 of the four and five star reviews were all written on the same day, August 21, 2012.  That same day was not the release date or even close to it.  And most of these reviews are one or two sentences long and thats it.  I'm going to rush to judgment here and suppose that somebody is padding the numbers to artifically inflate the number of stars for this indie film.  Several of the other 'glowing' reviews are within a day or two of Aug 21.  All the other reviews are spread out over a significant span of time.  I'm calling shenanigans.Its just not good.It drags at about a snails pace.  The plot is easily discernible in the first fifteen minutes.The concept of the three-sided story is entertaining, but not enough to save this movie.  The idea that a sociology major who plans on specializing in caregiving hasnt learned anything by her senior year about abuse and how to deal with it is ludicrous.  Instead of following through on her initial phone call to report the possible abuse to the authorities, she decides that staging a fake rape with the individual is the better idea.  Really.  She goes so far as to give her mentally handicapped patient a handjob into a dixie cup to acquire his sperm, so that she can make her story more credible and accumulate some material evidence.  I'm not sure if theres a handjob 101 class or if its in the graduate level of study, but I'm pretty sure it isnt the typical recommended course of treatment.  Probably offcampus on the job training, I'd guess.Rather than talk to a professor, or her parents, or the police, or follow up on it further with the mother, the answer is apparently - stage a fake rape and get the mentally handicapped invalid removed from his mother's care.  This is obviosuly better than actually trying to discern if there is actual abuse going on.This was painfully stupid.  Now I'm not saying that sociology majors are smarter than a bagful of doorknobs, but this was an all time low.This movie had the potential to be intriguing, but the stupidity factor was overwhelming.

1546795,A1PTBXZG04GT29,B0085QJ1YM,NewAgeMama,"[32, 33]","Scalene is not a movie for the faint of heart. It deals with many touchy issues including rape, murder, abuse and the effects of drug use. The story revolves around a young man named Jacob. When he was twelve, he was experimenting with his friends. His attempts at a cheap high resulted in severe brain damage which left him childish and unable to speak. His mother is dealing with this alone, and when she meets a gentlemen who displays an interest in her, she hires a college student named Paige to help with Jacob.While this is the basic gist of the film, it was told in a way that made it quite unique. It starts out going backwards, starting with Jacob's mother coming to try to attack Paige and saying, ""I want him back."" From there you go backwards, seeing the events that led up the possible rape from the mother's perspective. Then there is a scene where Jacob gets burned and for a few minutes you see things though his eyes. Then it switches to Paige's point of view, and you start moving forward in time again, leading back up to the initial attack. This may sound confusing, but it actually worked well. It gives you the perspective of all the main characters, without giving away the climax to soon.This film invoked some mixed emotions in me. On the one hand, I liked the idea. It was unique, and the little known cast were all amazing.  As someone who can relate to the struggles of having a mentally handicapped family member, I understand the frustration the  mother encountered. I could also relate to Paige as the young girl who suspects abuse and isn't sure how to handle it. Though, I honestly think that anything else would have been a better than than what she decided. Paige's decisions made me feel that she was the most disturbed of all the characters, and yet, this is what made the story compelling and original.

1546797,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0085QJ1YM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Scalene (Zack Parker, 2011)The main problem with Scalene is that it is roughly half of a very interesting movie. We get all of the setup, and then just when the story is about to kick into gear, the movie ends  and you realize that what you thought was the crucial piece of the setup was, in fact, meant as a twist ending. And to be fair to the movie, it does function that way, but it still feels like setup&#8212;and that makes it lack the twist-ending punch that would at least give it the gravitas necessary to perform its function in that regard.Jakob Trimble (Stake Land's Adam Scarimbolo) is twenty-six, mute, and somewhat mentally challenged. His mother Janice (Justified's Margo Martindale) has done most of the caregiving, though she mentions in one scene that he has also had a series of outside caregivers as well. The most recent of them is Paige (The Virgin Suicides' Hanna Hall). The film gives us a year of Paige working for Janice and Jakob through the eyes of all three participants. Something has gone terribly wrong, however; in the opening shot, we see Janice showing up at Paige's front door brandishing a gun. From there, we go back to when Paige is initially hired, and we see how we get from point A to point B.While I think this is a minor spoiler (I have been trying to avoid spoilers throughout despite a number of them appearing in every synopsis of the movie I have read), it's really something you want to know heading into this: it is a nasty little movie. There are no good guys here. That's interesting, because the movie is set up to be all good guys; Parker is playing the meta here, and he's pretty effective about it. (There is a scene early in the movie that you may spend some time wondering about. That scene is the one that tips Parker's hand that there are no good guys, not even the most obvious one.) Balancing that out , of course, is the missing second half of this movie. What should have been setup for the actual movie, which I think would have ended up being a bang-up trial thriller, is instead climax. The trade-off is that it does work in that it seems to inspire a good deal of discussion in the places one finds such things on the Internet, and I will certainly not complain about a filmmaker leaving unanswered questions when it makes sense in the context (it does here). I wonder if there's going to be a sequel? ** ",3,Three's a crowd.,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,2374,"['Scalene', 'Zack', 'Parker', '2011', 'main', 'problem', 'Scalene', 'roughly', 'half', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'get', 'setup', 'then', 'just', 'when', 'story', 'kick', 'gear', 'movie', 'realize', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'crucial', 'piece', 'setup', 'was', 'fact', 'meant', 'twist', 'ending', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'function', 'way', 'still', 'setup', '8212', 'lack', 'twist-ending', 'punch', 'would', 'least', 'give', 'gravitas', 'necessary', 'perform', 'function', 'regard.Jakob', 'Trimble', 'Stake', 'Land', 'Adam', 'Scarimbolo', 'twenty-six', 'mute', 'somewhat', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'mother', 'Janice', 'Justified', 'Margo', 'Martindale', 'done', 'most', 'caregiving', 'one', 'scene', 'also', 'had', 'series', 'outside', 'caregivers', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'recent', 'Paige', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'Hanna', 'Hall', 'film', 'year', 'Paige', 'working', 'Janice', 'Jakob', 'eyes', 'three', 'participants', 'Something', 'gone', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'however', 'opening', 'shot', 'see', 'Janice', 'showing', 'up', 'Paige', 'front', 'door', 'brandishing', 'gun', 'there', 'go', 'back', 'when', 'Paige', 'initially', 'hired', 'see', 'how', 'get', 'point', 'point', 'B.While', 'think', 'minor', 'spoiler', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'number', 'appearing', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'have', 'read', 'really', 'something', 'want', 'know', 'heading', 'nasty', 'little', 'movie', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'here', 'interesting', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'good', 'guys', 'Parker', 'playing', 'meta', 'here', 'pretty', 'effective', 'scene', 'early', 'movie', 'may', 'spend', 'time', 'wondering', 'about', 'scene', 'one', 'Parker', 'hand', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'not', 'even', 'most', 'obvious', 'one', 'Balancing', 'out', 'course', 'missing', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'setup', 'actual', 'movie', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'bang-up', 'trial', 'thriller', 'instead', 'climax', 'trade-off', 'work', 'inspire', 'good', 'deal', 'discussion', 'places', 'one', 'finds', 'such', 'things', 'Internet', 'will', 'certainly', 'not', 'complain', 'filmmaker', 'leaving', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'when', 'sense', 'context', 'here', 'wonder', 'going', 'be', 'sequel', '**']",N/A

The acting isn't horrible but the characters are a little too amateur to watch for the length of the movie . The script could have been written by a 14 year old. I didn't find the camera work all that effective. The end was like finding out you've gone on a one way street with no outlet it . It was dismal, but not in any sort of artsy, intelligent, or believable way. If it was supposed to create an ethical dilemma, it failed miserably.The majority of 5 star reviews were all posted in August of this year. It's like there was an onslaught of friends promoting the film. Those reviews either don't really say anything substantial or they are written as if by paid movie critics.

1546799,A2WADHJJ3CX3PZ,B0085QJ1YM,Terra Amador,"[0, 0]","I thought this was a horror movie. However, it is a very sad movie about a mentally handicapped young man who is being abused by his mother. She hires a caregiver for him & the caregiver discovers the physical abuse when she sees bruises. The young man is very gentle, unable to talk or defend himself. The caretaker does something unthinkably stupid and dangerous in an attempt to help the many get out of his situation. However, her &#34;plan&#34; backfired so badly that the boy ended up in prison & his mother dead which were all the resulting occurrences after the caregiver he completed the plan. I was sickened by the caregivers behavior and what she did to &#34;help&#34; the young man. Furthermore, I was totally depressed at the end because the story reminds you that this situation is something that occurs in out society all the time. Developmentally delayed individuals are prime targets for an abuser. This is a very real problem that exists in our society. Unfortunately many don't get help or taken away from the abusive  situation because they are unable or unaware or confused among other things so they can't reach out or ask for the help they need.
