942492,A3JPNYUTLSEAQN,B000BI1YU6,"John L. Hughes, Jr. ""hughes_jr""","[12, 14]","The first concert dvd by this legendary group is a winner.  Ronald and Ernie continuously breathe life into such classics as ""Who's That Lady"", ""For The Love Of You"" and ""It's Your Thing"" by performing the songs as if they were recorded last week.  Ronald's enjoyable stage presence is contagious, while Ernie's soaring guitar solos are still amazing after all these years.  The female dancers are sexy yet very classy, while the beautiful and talented Johnson Sisters provide cool sweet and sassy background vocals (check out their creative background vocals on ""Twist and Shout""). The only minor glitches here is the sound mix on the female vocals on ""Contagious"" and the fact that one wishes that it was longer than an hour and fifteen minutes.  DVD extras feature interesting interviews with the brothers (yay).",5,Good Job!,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,815,"['first', 'concert', 'dvd', 'legendary', 'group', 'winner', 'Ronald', 'Ernie', 'continuously', 'life', 'such', 'classics', 'Who', 'Lady', 'Love', 'Your', 'Thing', 'performing', 'songs', 'were', 'recorded', 'last', 'week', 'Ronald', 'enjoyable', 'stage', 'presence', 'contagious', 'Ernie', 'soaring', 'guitar', 'solos', 'are', 'still', 'amazing', 'years', 'female', 'dancers', 'are', 'sexy', 'yet', 'very', 'classy', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Johnson', 'Sisters', 'provide', 'cool', 'sweet', 'sassy', 'background', 'vocals', 'check', 'out', 'creative', 'background', 'vocals', 'Twist', 'Shout', 'only', 'minor', 'glitches', 'here', 'sound', 'mix', 'female', 'vocals', 'Contagious', 'fact', 'one', 'was', 'longer', 'hour', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'extras', 'feature', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'brothers', 'yay']",N/A

I had seen them in person, and they were good. This seems like a concert they squeezed in, because obviously no energy or no effort was put out there. The Isleys should have never put this one on DVD.

The dancers were great to look at and the back up singer were off the hook in those black dresses, wow ! I wish there more Isley brother on stage, but I guess that would be too much to ask for, as far as the vocals, true he has loss a bit on the high notes, but that's to be expected at his age, however he's still getting it done. The Mr. Big stuff was great, Mr. Big I hope that will never go away. I read a review about the end of the show being bad, maybe his sound system needs to be upgraded. It was a great show only wish it was longer, It made me get up and shake my booty, loved it !!!Mr. Big aka The Nature boy....",5,Still Jamming,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,741,"['watched', 'dvd', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'togather', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'not', 'dvd', 'love', 'song', 'dancers', 'were', 'great', 'look', 'back', 'singer', 'were', 'hook', 'black', 'dresses', 'wow', 'wish', 'there', 'more', 'Isley', 'brother', 'stage', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'as', 'far', 'vocals', 'true', 'loss', 'bit', 'high', 'notes', 'be', 'expected', 'age', 'however', 'still', 'getting', 'done', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'stuff', 'was', 'great', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'hope', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'away', 'read', 'review', 'end', 'show', 'being', 'bad', 'maybe', 'sound', 'system', 'be', 'upgraded', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'only', 'wish', 'was', 'longer', 'made', 'get', 'up', 'shake', 'booty', 'loved', 'Mr', 'Big', 'Nature', 'boy']",N/A
942496,ACHX77Z6FHIUX,B000BI1YU6,"Music Video Lover ""Music Video Lover""","[3, 4]","When this DVD was purchased, I thought it was ""The Isley Brothers"".  I guess I didn't read the cover carefully enough because you get what you pay for, I guess.  As indicated on the cover, you see Ron and Ernest Isley and that's exactly who you get -- Not the Isley Brothers, the group. This DVD also shows several over-aged female dancers who look like they should be at home with their kids rather than dancing on stage.  I was very disappointed and not impressed with this DVD at all.  I will rate this DVD with two stars, at best.  You should save your money and buy a DVD with the ""original"" Isley Brothers or use your money to buy some other DVD.",2,Save Your Money,1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,652,"['When', 'DVD', 'was', 'purchased', 'thought', 'was', 'Isley', 'Brothers', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'cover', 'carefully', 'enough', 'get', 'what', 'pay', 'guess', 'indicated', 'cover', 'see', 'Ron', 'Ernest', 'Isley', 'exactly', 'who', 'get', 'Not', 'Isley', 'Brothers', 'group', 'DVD', 'also', 'several', 'over-aged', 'female', 'dancers', 'who', 'look', 'should', 'be', 'home', 'kids', 'rather', 'dancing', 'stage', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'not', 'impressed', 'DVD', 'will', 'rate', 'DVD', 'two', 'stars', 'best', 'should', 'save', 'money', 'buy', 'DVD', 'original', 'Isley', 'Brothers', 'use', 'money', 'buy', 'other', 'DVD']",N/A
