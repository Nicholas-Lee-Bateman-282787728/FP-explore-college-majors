In my eyes, Whitney could do no wrong...and because of this I was not looking for a powerful performance from her. However, the most powerful performance came from Carmen Ejogo! Wow! I truly believed her character's facial expressions, timing, and depth was all there. She made you feel like she lived Sistah's life and wish the entire movie was based on her instead of Sparkle. The only other believable actors were Tika Sumpter,Omari Hardwick, Curtis Armstrong and a little bit of Derek Luke. Who knows, it could have been the script or the director.

I was expecting a much more stand out performance from Whitney Houston, but she looked so old and haggard in this film it was almost a joke. She plays the part of a strict mom who practically tosses her girls out on the street. The part I didn't get is why old momma would think her daughter's lyrics are too sexual, but in the end, buys her daughter a dress with very little coverage to wear on stage.The only acting that truly stood out was that of the older sister. Her story line was really the only one of interest. I felt Sparkle's just didn't have the drama it needed. Also, I fail to believe an unknown singer like her could pack a whole auditorium of people in to see her show, so the ending wasn't that great either.Not the best movie, but not the worst.

1578490,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008Y1YJN6,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Earlier this year, a certain movie name `Sparkle' was released.  It was one of those `Dreamgirls' type films that looked marginally entertaining and clich&eacute; ridden and so I passed rather easily.  I had no desire to waste my time on the film.  The reviews weren't very forgiving, and while it escaped with `decent' notices, it never sounded like something that had to be seen.  But, amidst the sea of lukewarm reviews there was a bright spot; a sparkle if you will.Carmen Ejogo.Ejogo received `star is born' type notices, being singled out as a bright light in the cast and a performance that had to be seen.  For about a week buzz on the internet exploded and people started wondering if she could actually snag an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of troubled Sister.  That buzz died rather quickly, mostly because an Oscar nomination for a film like `Sparkle' was, well, impossible.  Still, with the nominees released for both the Black Reel Entertainment Awards and the NAACP Image Awards I'm kind of baffled that Ejogo hasn't landed on their Supporting Actress ballots.  I mean, Naomi Harris is a very talented actress, but what exactly does she do in `Skyfall'?  I've seen the film and she's nothing but sexy.  Henson was great in `Think Like a Man', but there is marginal character development at best.  Seriously, tell me what Stenberg does in `The Hunger Games' that warrants a nomination?Snubbing Ejogo is just ludicrous!I guess you can probably guess that despite my initial disinterest, I actually saw `Sparkle'.`Sparkle' is the film I expected.  It is marginally entertaining and clich&eacute; ridden.  Sadly, this very complaint trickles into each and every character depicted; except Sister.  The story tells that of young Sparkle, a goodie-two-shoes daughter of a hardnosed mother with a dark past who keeps a tight grip on her three daughters and demands they give up their dreams for a relationship with God.  Taking place in the 60's, the world is bursting with the sound of Motown, and Sparkle has a knack for penning some catchy songs.  Her sister Sister has the presence to make those songs unforgettable and soon, with the help of an up and coming manager the two sisters and their younger sister Dolores form a girl group (Sister and her sisters) behind their mother's back.  Of course, drama overtakes the group and their dreams are shattered due to a series of circumstances, but that's to be expected.`Sparkle' tries really hard to be `Dreamgirls', but `Dreamgirls' wasn't even that great of a film so it isn't really trying to be much of anything memorable.  It has some nice moments, some nice music and some nice sets but overall the film is pretty empty.  The skeletal character development is sad.  Sparkle is your blandly depicted straight laced innocent girl with dreams bigger than her town.  Dolores is nearly absent and is only there to serve as a third member to the group.  Emma, the mother, is nothing more than a stereotype.  She looks disapprovingly every time her daughter's open their mouths and she plays the overprotective mother hen with no shades, even when the screenplay tries to give her some.  The immediate turnaround at the film's end is bizarre and carries little weight.  Satin, Sister's comedian husband, is a stereotypical brute with no depth and Stix is as blandly written as they come (what has happened to Derek Luke?)But then there is Ejogo and her portrayal of Sister.  I mean, it's almost like she's from a different movie entirely, and Ejogo tries desperately to save this sinking film.  She almost does, for every scene that she is in shines so brightly because of her presence.  The amazing thing is that she didn't have to try so hard.  Sister is a character that actually has depth and there was a bounty of material here for her but instead of resting on the obvious, Ejogo digs so much deeper.  She could have relied on sexy, but instead of infused so much desperation and eventual pain into her sexy.  She nailed it, and the relationship with Satin and her refusal to accept the life she once had is marvelously lived in.She left me speechless.So, while I can't recommend the film itself too highly, I do insist that you see it.  Ejogo deserves that much.  I'll be surprised if she doesn't land on my Supporting Actress ballot this year, she's that impressive here.  In a sea of `nothing characters', Ejogo truly sparkles.",3,Ejogo sparkles beyond expectations!,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,4400,"['Earlier', 'year', 'certain', 'movie', 'name', 'Sparkle', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'one', 'Dreamgirls', 'type', 'films', 'looked', 'marginally', 'entertaining', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridden', 'so', 'passed', 'rather', 'easily', 'had', 'desire', 'waste', 'time', 'film', 'reviews', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'forgiving', 'escaped', 'decent', 'notices', 'never', 'sounded', 'something', 'had', 'be', 'seen', 'sea', 'lukewarm', 'reviews', 'was', 'bright', 'spot', 'sparkle', 'will.Carmen', 'Ejogo.Ejogo', 'received', 'star', 'born', 'type', 'notices', 'being', 'singled', 'out', 'bright', 'light', 'cast', 'performance', 'had', 'be', 'seen', 'week', 'buzz', 'internet', 'exploded', 'people', 'started', 'wondering', 'could', 'actually', 'snag', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'portrayal', 'troubled', 'Sister', 'buzz', 'died', 'rather', 'quickly', 'mostly', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'Sparkle', 'was', 'well', 'impossible', 'Still', 'nominees', 'released', 'Black', 'Reel', 'Entertainment', 'Awards', 'NAACP', 'Image', 'Awards', ""'m"", 'kind', 'baffled', 'Ejogo', ""n't"", 'landed', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'ballots', 'mean', 'Naomi', 'Harris', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'what', 'exactly', 'do', 'Skyfall', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'nothing', 'sexy', 'Henson', 'was', 'great', 'Think', 'Man', 'marginal', 'character', 'development', 'best', 'Seriously', 'tell', 'what', 'Stenberg', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'warrants', 'nomination', 'Snubbing', 'Ejogo', 'just', 'ludicrous', 'guess', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'initial', 'disinterest', 'actually', 'saw', ""Sparkle'."", 'Sparkle', 'film', 'expected', 'marginally', 'entertaining', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridden', 'Sadly', 'very', 'complaint', 'trickles', 'character', 'depicted', 'Sister', 'story', 'young', 'Sparkle', 'goodie-two-shoes', 'daughter', 'hardnosed', 'mother', 'dark', 'past', 'who', 'tight', 'grip', 'three', 'daughters', 'demands', 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'relationship', 'God', 'Taking', 'place', '60', 'world', 'bursting', 'sound', 'Motown', 'Sparkle', 'knack', 'penning', 'catchy', 'songs', 'sister', 'Sister', 'presence', 'make', 'songs', 'unforgettable', 'soon', 'help', 'up', 'coming', 'manager', 'two', 'sisters', 'younger', 'sister', 'form', 'girl', 'group', 'Sister', 'sisters', 'mother', 'back', 'course', 'drama', 'group', 'dreams', 'are', 'shattered', 'due', 'series', 'circumstances', 'be', 'expected.', 'Sparkle', 'tries', 'really', 'hard', 'be', 'Dreamgirls', 'Dreamgirls', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'great', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'trying', 'be', 'much', 'anything', 'memorable', 'nice', 'moments', 'nice', 'music', 'nice', 'sets', 'film', 'pretty', 'empty', 'skeletal', 'character', 'development', 'sad', 'Sparkle', 'blandly', 'depicted', 'straight', 'laced', 'innocent', 'girl', 'dreams', 'bigger', 'town', 'Dolores', 'nearly', 'absent', 'only', 'there', 'serve', 'third', 'member', 'group', 'Emma', 'mother', 'nothing', 'more', 'stereotype', 'disapprovingly', 'time', 'daughter', 'open', 'mouths', 'overprotective', 'mother', 'hen', 'shades', 'even', 'when', 'screenplay', 'give', 'immediate', 'turnaround', 'film', 'end', 'bizarre', 'little', 'weight', 'Satin', 'Sister', 'comedian', 'husband', 'stereotypical', 'brute', 'depth', 'Stix', 'as', 'blandly', 'written', 'come', 'what', 'happened', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'then', 'Ejogo', 'portrayal', 'Sister', 'mean', 'almost', 'different', 'movie', 'entirely', 'Ejogo', 'desperately', 'save', 'sinking', 'film', 'almost', 'scene', 'shines', 'so', 'brightly', 'presence', 'amazing', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'Sister', 'character', 'actually', 'depth', 'was', 'bounty', 'material', 'here', 'instead', 'resting', 'obvious', 'Ejogo', 'so', 'much', 'deeper', 'could', 'have', 'relied', 'sexy', 'instead', 'infused', 'so', 'much', 'desperation', 'eventual', 'pain', 'sexy', 'nailed', 'relationship', 'Satin', 'refusal', 'accept', 'life', 'once', 'had', 'marvelously', 'lived', 'in.She', 'left', 'speechless.So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'too', 'highly', 'do', 'insist', 'see', 'Ejogo', 'much', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', ""n't"", 'land', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'ballot', 'year', 'impressive', 'here', 'sea', 'nothing', 'characters', 'Ejogo', 'truly']",N/A

""Sparkle"" also comes with a cardboard cover case.JUDGMENT CALL:Last year, I was entertained by Salim Akil's ""Jump the Broom"" and after seeing the remake of ""Sparkle"", I can easily say that I was entertained once again.Sure, the film received a lot of attention as Whitney Houston's final film as an actress and it's understandable to see why.  Houston shows us a happier side of the singer/actress/producer but there are other pluses of this remake of why ""Sparkle"" is a film worth watching.First, the film is a remake of the 1976 film of the same name.  While circumstances are similar in terms of three daughters trying to make it in the music industry and one hindered by drugs and domestic abuse, the original film was almost a rags-to-riches story of a trio born from late '50s Harlem and the film deals with the seedy underground of local gangsters and mafia involvement.  That's where the 2012 film differs from the original.The setting of this film is in 1968 and the young ladies are not from the ghetto.  They live in a beautiful home, they have jobs, one is trying to be a doctor, they are heavily involved with their church's choir.  There is an emphasis by the writers to not show the banality of African American films and making these characters live in a better situation.  Also, where the original film features their mother who is hardworking as a maid in order to support her three children, Whitney Houston's character of Emma is not struggling.  She has a job, she had troubles in her life but now has become religious and a mother caring for her children, despite wanting to protect them from the life she endured while pursuing a career in the music industry.The three sisters which consists of Sister, Dee and Sparkle were fascinating to watch.  Many people are familiar with the amazing musical talent of Jordin Sparks, but I have not heard of Carmen Ejogo prior to this film and felt that she absolutely shined in this film more than anyone in the cast.  Not only was she expected to play the sexy, rebellious daughter who can sing but also to take on the role of the daughter who later gets high on drugs and is beaten continuously by her husband.  In fact, while the film is named Sparkle, most of the film earlier on, tends to focus on Carmen Ejogo's character of Sister.She is the oldest daughter/sister, she is the primary vocalist, she is the one dating the comedian Satin and the musical careers of the sisters falls on her shoulders.  While the character Dee is not a major highlight in the film (until the end), unlike Dwan Smith's Dolores in the 1976 film, Dee is portrayed as a young woman who cares about her sisters but also one pursuing higher education.Where Sparkle comes in, is the youngest sister and daughter who doesn't know where her place is in the world.  Her boyfriend Stix is the manager and promoter but as a respectable sister, she is fine in being the background singer, the person that is not the center of the group.  Also, where middle-sister Dee is the primary thinker of the three sisters, Sparkle wants to see how far the careers of the Sister & the Sisters group will go and if they get the recording contact they were offered.It's only when the character of Sister is taken out of the film due to an unfortunate incident, the spotlight then begins to shine on Sparkle.  She must make a choice, follow her mother's wishes to abandon her musical career or pursue her dream?And while the original film was probably more of product of its time especially with the inclusion of the gangsters and mafia, writer Mara Brok Akil did a good job in trying to keep this 2012 film much different than its predecessor by making the ladies much more respectable and less focus about the seedy crime life but to focus on the troubles of the ladies trying to have a musical career and one being subjected to domestic abuse and drugs.""Sparkle"" is a film that showcases beautiful music that makes you want to groove and its lossless soundtrack on Blu-ray definitely makes this film sound much more incredible and lively.  Picture quality is also wonderful and for special features, several making of featurettes but also a tribute to Whitney Houston who passed away three months after the making of the film.Overall, ""Sparkle"" is a well-done remake of the original 1976 film that not only showcases the beautiful performances by Whitney Houston and Jordin Sparks but also introduces us to a fine actress in Carmen Ejogo, who I hope to see more of in the near future.  Another wonderful film from Salim Akil and crew, ""Sparkle"" is recommended on Blu-ray!",4,Feat. beautiful performances by Whitney Houston and Jordin Sparks but also introduces us to a fine actress in Carmen Ejogo!,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,7355,"['director', 'Salim', 'Akil', 'Jumping', 'Broom', 'Game', 'remake', '1976', 'film', 'Sparkle', 'originally', 'written', 'Joel', 'Schumacher',

1578515,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B008Y1YJN6,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","There's an indisputable star of this synthetically watchable 2012 melodrama, and it's neither the late Whitney Houston in her last role nor Season 6 ""American Idol"" winner Jordin Sparks. It's relatively unknown British actress Carmen Ejogo (Maya Rudolph's sister inAway We Go) who explodes off the screen in the meaty, scene-stealing role of Sister, the hell-raising eldest of a trio of daughters to Emma Anderson, an uptight, church-going woman who raised them on her own. Emma is Houston's supporting role, and while she proves she had the makings of a solid character actress, there is an unfortunate shroud of irony in her presence given her own tragic, tabloid-saturated life was itself a cautionary tale about the lure of drugs in show business. This time in the part Lonette McKee played valiantly in the1976 original, Ejogo inhabits the character living out the nightmare of drug addiction and spousal abuse.The rest of the movie is mostly by the numbers. It opens in 1968, a decade later than the original movie's story, with Sister and her little sister Sparkle sneaking out to a nightclub headlined by a period-costumed Cee Lo Green in a cameo appearance. Sister vamps her way through an original song by Sparkle, which attracts the attention of an aspiring record producer named Stix. He encourages them to shoot for the big time, so they convince level-headed sister Dee to make it a trio decked out sequins, wigs and false eyelashes in order to become the next Supremes. What struck me is how eerily the three women look like the original Supremes line-up with Sparks resembling Florence Ballard and Ejogo looking like a sultry cross between Diana Ross and Beyonc&eacute;. Of course, their newfound success comes with heartache, as Sister takes up with a smooth albeit vicious stand-up comic named Satin, and Sparkle struggles between family devotion and her burgeoning love for Stix.Naturally Emma is constantly worried that her girls will repeat the same mistakes she made when she tried to make it as a singer only to be spit out by the music industry. That means Houston spends most of her limited screen time either fretting about her family or being self-righteous about her religious convictions. The dinner table scene between her and Ejogo is the movie's best moment laying bare the deep-seeded resentment Sister has for her mother and providing a flash of grief over a line that reminds you how Houston died. The melodrama is laid on pretty thick, especially during Sister's downward spiral, but director Salim Akil (Jumping The Broom) and his wife, screenwriter Mara Brock Akil, balance it with just enough lighter moments. The songs, of course, are what matters the most, and smartly, Curtis Mayfield's original compositions have been retained with the standouts being ""Hooked on Your Love"", ""Look into Your Heart"" and especially ""Something He Can Feel"" which Ejogo performs with sultry conviction.The new songs by R. Kelly are not nearly as memorable since they sound too contemporary for the period. Sadly, Houston sings only once in character, the spiritual stand-by, ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow"", and limited to her lower register, her coarsened voice, while emotionally impactful, is vocally a mere shadow of her once-beautiful pipes. Sparks gets to sing a lot more with a predictably booming voice, and she delivers an unaffected turn in the title role.

When Ms Houston set out to re-make the 1976 film, I suspect she wanted to tone-down the over-the-top histrionics that turned the story into a campy fiasco. But she took it too far: the new &#34;Sparkle&#34; succeeds only as a peek into the last months of Ms. Houston's life. The story is typical: former alcoholic Singer finds Jesus and is determined that her daughters will not repeat her mistakes. They do, with varying results. As &#34;Sparkle,&#34; Jordin Sparks is wretched. She poses beautifully but simply cannot act. Irene Cara played the role in the original and is superior in every way. The other characters in the film are forgettable and the entire project reeks of a &#34;Lifetime&#34; movie gone bad. There is one scene that I can't believe made the final cut: Ms. Houston lecturing the hapless Sparkle about the evils of drugs and the &#34;bloodsucking&#34; music business is in bad taste after her death. Which brings us to Ms. Houston's performance. Wearing heavy makeup and clearly overweight, she nevertheless is somewhat affecting. Her acting here is better than in &#34;The Bodyguard,&#34; where she played herself, or in &#34;Waiting to Exhale,&#34; where she acted like a guest on &#34;Springer.&#34; The best scene in the film is also the saddest: Ms. Houston's big musical moment singing a gospel solo at a funeral: her voice clearly gone and her ravaged body unable to snap to life.

1578526,APEOO1ATR5VHB,B008Y1YJN6,"Hype Currie ""scholar of pop culture""","[0, 1]","""Sparkle"" is a musical drama starring former American Idol winner Jordin Sparks.  The plot, centered in Detroit of the late 1960s, focuses on a tight-knit family of young women who form a pop vocal group and pursue music-business fame, all while trying to avoid the wrath of their mother.  The late Whitney Houston portrays Emma, the family matriarch.Boutique manager Emma keeps her girls on a short leash.  19-year-old Sparkle dutifully keeps a job in the same store as Emma, and she participates in choir with older sister Dee (Tika Sumpter), a medical school candidate.  Eldest sister Sister/Tammi (Carmen Ejogo) is recently returned from a reportedly unsuccessful stint in New York City.  Sparkle composes secular songs in secret, and lately has been sneaking out to nightclubs where the outgoing Sister performs the material to excited crowds.Stix (Derek Luke), an aspiring music executive, sees both of them at the club and at church.  He convinces the sisters to make a run for the big time, with him as manager.  Soon, the trio of `Sister and her Sisters' becomes a prominent local act, gaining the attention of major music labels.  Meanwhile, Stix and Sparkle (whose shyness belies her own singing talent) become smitten with one another.Mike Epps convincingly plays the devious Satin: a ""crossover"" standup comedian who desperately wants to rebuild a rapport with African American audiences.  His smooth ways--and apparent affluence--quickly win him over with Sister, but his doping and physical abuse figure to derail everyone's goals.  Ejogo, easily the dramatic anchor of the film, is a revelation as Sister:  a worldly and blunt counterpoint to the innocence of Sparkle, she carries the most resentment against Emma, and suffers the most by narrative's end.Houston has, in some sense, a thankless role here.  Emma's stern church-lady clich&eacute;s dominate her character's arc.  Houston plays her as devoutly religious but visibly world-weary; the plot hints at--but never fully reveals--Emma's stunted singing career, and the film suffers for it.  The audience is expected to fill in the blanks on why she's bitter.  Several lines of dialogue and plot points inadvertently have an eerie ring to them in light of Houston's untimely death.The film is a remake of the 1976 original which has since gained an enduring cult status.  Lead producer Bishop T.D. Jakes, co-writer Mara Brock-Akil and director Salim Akil infuse the film with standard gospel-play themes of temptation, falling from grace, forgiveness and redemption.

Their very strict mother Emma (Whitney Houston) would prefer that they all live normal and happy routine lives but Sparkle (Jordan Sparks) has a dream of her own...This is an excellent movie and the songs and dancing are just spectacular. The singers in the movie were outstanding and this movie is a great one to watch just for that alone.  Jordan Sparks did an excellent job in her portrayal of Sparkle and her desire to succeed carried her through the character's life and ambitions to be a smash hit singer.

When I realized that Sparkle was a film she had made right before she died, I felt compelled to see it but I didn't get my hopes up as I'd assumed that it would be a performance that wouldn't leave me with any closure in regards to her untimely death, but I was very wrong. Whitney did an amazing job in this movie, she really did play her role as supporting actress superbly and whenever her character, Emma, is in a scene she steals the scene. Her performance in this movie is so honest, raw, and genuine. You can tell that Whitney had to draw on her own life experiences to really play the character of Emma effectively and she did it excellently. This version of Sparkle deviates slightly from the original so it's definitely not a typical remake and its not a carbon copy of the 1976 version but it still delivers, I am sure people will like this version just as much as the old one. Jordin Sparks sang like I've never heard her sing before, she was simply awesome, and the soundtrack to this movie is catchy, anyone who's a fan of the Motown era will just like the soundtrack alone. Carmen Ejogo and Tika Sumpter gave terrific performances as well. I liked the feisty demeanor of both of their characters. And of course anyone who's a Whitney fan will love this movie, I promise.

She simply needs someone to believe in her. American Idol won't be holding auditions for another 30 years, so she loads up the Rambler with all her bad poetry journals and a few sequin gowns and heads to the Big City.  Of course, it's a cautionary tale fraught with peril. She finds many villains along the way, and often where she least expects them. She endures many hardships, including a level 5 trauma tornado that hits right at the knuckle-biting brink of her greatest triumph!Yes, it's a dark and stormy night for our little star.

Sparkle parking herself in the Mogul's lobby for days until he finally agrees to see her. Sparkle enlisting the help of all the little woodland creatures to put on a show. Sparkle rehearsing in nerdy glasses, exhausted and nearly giving up until she sings a rousing chorus of ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."" Sparkle inspiring her dysfunctional family and magically healing all the old wounds. Finally, her perseverance is rewarded tenfold - but only after she realizes that all she truly needed was to believe in herself.  Well, that and a sparkly ruby red dress with a neckline cut all the way down to Australia. The end. Awesome, right??Seriously, Hollywood. We all love the Cinderella story.

Just like there have been several movies and works of art about The Beatles, there are several works that are directly and indirectly related to The Supremes. (Kinda makes you wonder if there will ever be room for a true biopic of either The Beatles or The Supremes?!?!?). In fact, just the image or silhouette of 3 female singers immediately harkens to The Supremes.""Sparkle"" is about a girl group, three sisters (and even though The Emotions, Love Unlimited and The Pointer Sisters do actually feature sisters in a girl group......it is The Supremes that come to mind when you see 3 female singers together). It is set in inner city America that could be Chicago or it could be Detroit, just like The Supremes came from Detroit. Beyond the normal struggles of groups, girls in particular but not specifically, the similarities don't go too much further than that.Diana Ross is neither Deena Jones (""Dreamgirls"") nor Sister of The Sisters (""Sparkle""). What is more commonplace is the support system and personalities which underscore why a marywilson is as generic, as it comes. Be it ""Sparkle"" or ""Dreamgirls"", the background singers never much arise higher than the personality of a marywilson. Who? Right. Marywilson. An ordinary background singer with a rather uninteresting backstory.The original ""Sparkle"" was embraced as an underground hit by the urban/black community. Though Aretha Franklin was commissioned to record the soundtrack, Lonette McKee and Irene Cara actually performed the music in the movie. Though Lonette is no match for Aretha, she has a unique vocal quality that many, myself included, that actually felt cheated that her versions of the songs were never released. Irene Cara is not only a Grammy nominated singer, but, also won an Oscar, a Golden Globe, an Image Award amongst others. So while Aretha provided a Gold album in her versions of the ""Sparkle"" songs, it was perplexing why the producers did not see the marquee value in both Lonette McKee and Irene Cara having their versions released.Fast forward to the 2012 film which reportedly was over a decade in the making, the cast is comparative to the original cast, Carmen Ejogo, in the role of ""sister"" walked away with the biggest buzz. With hardly any competition in the marketplace, the slate was cleared for this updated version to do solid box office...especially in light of Whitney's tragic transitioning. Unfortunately, the box office proved underwhelming. Since it reportedly only cost below $15 million, the road to profitability is a long and winding one......time will tell if it endures as a DVD rental title and/or cable favorite.This 2012 version does not distract nor add to ""Sparkle""'s appeal. However, it is worth acknowledging Whitney's dedication and determination to get this version ""green lit"". It at least introduces the story to a new, younger audience. And most of all, for Whitney fans, it gives us one more moment with her enormous talent. In the original, Mary Alice, a truly underrated wonder of an actress, does not sing....it is more of a dramatic role of a singing mother raising her daughters during their pubescent teen years. That element still remains with the benefit of Whitney singing ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"". Beyond the sentiment of seeing or rather hearing Whitney sing one more time, in ""Sparkle 2012"", Whitney is actually a better actress than a singer. Unfortunately we will never know what more potential thespian gifts Ms, Houston might later display. Where Diana Ross took to acting like she did to performing, Whitney had to grow from the ho-hum performance of character, Rachel Maron, to the better ensemble player in ""Waiting to Exhale"" and then the actually marked growth as an actress in the ho-hum remake of ""The Preacher's Wife"".Carmen Ejogo had already won my attention as the well meaning, but, not cut out for motherhood role in ""Lackawanna Blues"". The problem is that the powerful Lonette McKee still burns in the memory of fans of the original film.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[56, 58]","I went to see this movie because I wanted to see Whitney Houston's last performance.Sparkle tells the story of three sisters, raised in a nice home by a strict mother, played by Whitney Houston who used to be an alcoholic, but has found the Lord and wants to keep her daughter on the narrow path.As you watch this movie you will begin to notice this strategy has limited success.It's also framed as a cautionary tale about the bumpy road to fame.One daughter is a beautiful talented singer, another Sparkle is a talented songwriter who has always been in the sister's shade but prepared to sacrifice for the good of the group. The other one is simply brainy and attractive.The pitfalls of music and life are explored as the girls form a group and the singer gets into a relationship with a tv comedian and experiences a fall from grace. The movie explores themes of drugs and violence. Will she manage to retieve herself or will tragedy ensue? Rifts occur which threaten the family itself.I found the movie enjoyable. I loved Whitney Houston's singing solo. The quality of songs were pretty good with a mixture of gospel music and 60s motown type pieces.After I saw this movie I watched the originalSparklewith Philip Michael Thomas of Miami Vice, Irene Cara of Fame, and Lonette McKee.I highly recommend you check out the original. If you happen to be an Amazon Prime member as I write you can watch it for free. While the production values of the current movie are better, the original movie definitely has its moments. It features songs by Curtis Mayfield, a funk master, and I loved the singing performances of the girls with their delicate close harmonies. It also has an organised crime element. Events do differ between the two movies.The original is set in Harlem while the remake is set in Detroit. Judging by the reviews the original seems to have achieved a cult classic status with people claiming to have seen it a hundred times. I prefer the original but you may feel differently particularly if you are a Whitney Houston or Jordin Sparks fan.

When she planned on making a remake of the film Sparkle, a film that she had watched when she was a teenager, she never thought she would plan to remake the film. Sadly, she made the film and finished it shortly before she had passed away, earlier this year. No one ever thought that this would be her swan song. Nevertheless, loss was all around the film when she originally planned the film remake. The late singer Aaliyah was tapped to play the lead role in Sparkle in 2001, but because of her untimely death in a plane crash, the film was placed on the back burner for nearly a decade. The film which was released earlier this year was a somber farewell to the most important female singer in the world. With Jordin Sparks taking on the lead role, the question is could the chemistry work here. Well, it did just that.The 2012 remake of Sparkle stands tall, telling the tale of a inspiring singer Emma, raising her 3 kids, and surprised about seeing them drive into the world of stardom. Jordin, Carmen, and the cast had a lot to learn on the film, and drive not just through Whitney Houston, but also the shadows of the people who did the original film and the music. They did it nobly well. The film showcases a inspiring mother, but also wants her children to be bigger than the wastes of life with fame. Carmen takes that lead, but sadly hides her scars well from physical abuse and drug abuse from her family. Jordin shows that she can deliver well in acting, but had more to deliver in voice. Whitney's presence in the film is the real showstopper overall. When she did her number, His Eye On The Sparrow, it really brought me to tears, and showed regardless of the personal pain Whitney Houston went through and all the years she was treated as a joke, and not looked upon as a person that she could not only still sing and act, but thrive as a beautiful swan. Jordin Sparks and the cast had to thrive in voice from the shadows of Curtis Mayfield and Aretha Franklin and sold it to a whole new generation, but could've brought more into the songs.Overall, I promised myself that I would go see Sparkle when it came out the opening day, even before Whitney Houston passed on, and I kept it. I am so glad she made this heartwarming film, and reintroduced it to a whole new generation that really has forgotten what voice and song has meant to film and even music. The film did put a deep tear in my eye, and a real guilty pleasure for a new era. If you have just recently heard Whitney Houston from the impact of her death, or are a die hard fan of the original Sparkle, than you'll definitely love this film.Price: BRemastering: BStory: B 1/2+Music: C+Overall: B-",4,Dedication From The Voice,1350259200,"10 15, 2012",2012,2769,"['so', 'much', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'good', 'bad', 'When', 'planned', 'making', 'remake', 'film', 'Sparkle', 'film', 'had', 'watched', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'plan', 'remake', 'film', 'Sadly', 'made', 'film', 'finished', 'shortly', 'had', 'passed', 'away', 'earlier', 'year', 'one', 'ever', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'swan', 'song', 'Nevertheless', 'loss', 'was', 'film', 'when', 'originally', 'planned', 'film', 'remake', 'late', 'singer', 'Aaliyah', 'was', 'tapped', 'play', 'lead', 'role', 'Sparkle', '2001', 'untimely', 'death', 'plane', 'crash', 'film', 'was', 'placed', 'back', 'burner', 'nearly', 'decade', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'earlier', 'year', 'was', 'somber', 'farewell', 'most', 'important', 'female', 'singer', 'world', 'Jordin', 'Sparks', 'taking', 'lead', 'role', 'question', 'could', 'chemistry', 'work', 'here', 'Well', 'did', 'just', 'that.The', '2012', 'remake', 'Sparkle', 'tall', 'telling', 'tale', 'inspiring', 'singer', 'Emma', 'raising', '3', 'kids', 'surprised', 'seeing', 'drive', 'world', 'stardom', 'Jordin', 'Carmen', 'cast', 'had', 'lot', 'learn', 'film', 'drive', 'not', 'just', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'also', 'shadows', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'original', 'film', 'music', 'did', 'nobly', 'well', 'film', 'inspiring', 'mother', 'also', 'children', 'be', 'bigger', 'wastes', 'life', 'fame', 'Carmen', 'lead', 'sadly', 'scars', 'well', 'physical', 'abuse', 'drug', 'abuse', 'family', 'Jordin', 'can', 'deliver', 'well', 'acting', 'had', 'more', 'deliver', 'voice', 'Whitney', 'presence', 'film', 'real', 'showstopper', 'overall', 'When', 'did', 'number', 'Eye', 'Sparrow', 'really', 'brought', 'tears', 'showed', 'regardless', 'personal', 'pain', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'went', 'years', 'was', 'treated', 'joke', 'not', 'looked', 'person', 'could', 'not', 'only', 'still', 'sing', 'act', 'thrive', 'beautiful', 'swan', 'Jordin', 'Sparks', 'cast', 'had', 'thrive', 'voice', 'shadows', 'Curtis', 'Mayfield', 'Aretha', 'Franklin', 'sold', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'could', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'more', 'songs.Overall', 'promised', 'would', 'go', 'see', 'Sparkle', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'opening', 'day', 'even', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'passed', 'kept', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'made', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'reintroduced', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'really', 'forgotten', 'what', 'voice', 'song', 'meant', 'film', 'even', 'music', 'film', 'did', 'put', 'deep', 'tear', 'eye', 'real', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'new', 'era', 'have', 'just', 'recently', 'heard', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'impact', 'death', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'original', 'Sparkle', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'love', 'film.Price', 'BRemastering', 'BStory', '1/2+Music', 'C+Overall', 'B-']",N/A

I wanted to pay homage to Whitney in seeing her last film. I will purchase this movie to add it to my collection of Whitney movies I already own and sadly it is the last one. It's a good movie and I have a great like for them both.",4,Not quite the same yet similar.,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,974,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'saw', 'original', 'Sparkle', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'course', 'own', 'movie', 'When', 'heard', 'remake', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'exact', 'remake', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'committed', 'seeing', 'movie', 'am', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'New', 'Jersyan', 'Newark', 'Whitney', 'understand', 'why', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'even', 'liked', 'fact', 'Satin', 'original', 'was', 'low', 'life', 'criminal', 'remake', 'comedian', 'mother', 'maid', 'original', 'remake', 'dress', 'shop', 'Stix', 'was', 'songwriter', 'not', 'Sparkle', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'variations', 'remake', 'liked', 'remake', 'bad', 'guy', 'got', 'what', 'deserved', 'was', 'just', 'different', 'what', 'expected', 'wanted', 'pay', 'homage', 'Whitney', 'seeing', 'last', 'film', 'will', 'purchase', 'movie', 'add', 'collection', 'Whitney', 'movies', 'already', 'own', 'sadly', 'last', 'one', 'good', 'movie', 'have', 'great']",N/A
1578590,AHRKNAVOFIQG0,B008Y1YJN6,"TruthMatters ""Truth Can Help""","[0, 0]","My interest in this movie was that it was one of Whitney Houston's last movies if not her last.  The acting was pretty good.  It paralleled abuse Whitney had to take from her spouse but in the movie the lead singer went to prison for killing her husband (she took the rap for it anyway).  It was a sad movie.  It had a lot of truth in it in that when you are a parent (Whitney) that has had it rough or seen rough abusive situations you tend to be very protective with your children, sometimes too protective, and in return your children rebel on you.  Later on they understand what you were doing, some thank you for it, some never come back.  The good thing is that the movie has a good ending, but what is so sad to see is how the lead singer devalued herself just to become famous.  To her it was better than staying home and being nothing.  That is sad.  However, Sparkle, the younger sister, went on to success as her mother learned and ended up being supportive of her and her other sister before it was too late.  She did teach them right but her grip of fear was too tight and it almost ruined the oldest daughter, the lead singer.  Good job Whitney!  Sad that the lead singer had to go to prison, but you have this feeling she will be alright too as Whitney was now visiting her.  As an after thought, I like it more and more, though the abuse and emphasis on the lead singer's sex appeal was a little raunchy and sad.  So many things about the movie reflect Whitney's life and fame and the fruits of it's exposure.",4,nice movie - sad reality - but good ending,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,1525,"['interest', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'one', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'last', 'movies', 'not', 'last', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'paralleled', 'abuse', 'Whitney', 'had', 'take', 'spouse', 'movie', 'lead', 'singer', 'went', 'prison', 'killing', 'husband', 'took', 'rap', 'anyway', 'was', 'sad', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'truth', 'when', 'are', 'parent', 'Whitney', 'had', 'seen', 'rough', 'abusive', 'situations', 'tend', 'be', 'very', 'protective', 'children', 'sometimes', 'too', 'protective', 'return', 'children', 'rebel', 'Later', 'understand', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'thank', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'good', 'ending', 'what', 'so', 'sad', 'see', 'how', 'lead', 'singer', 'devalued', 'just', 'become', 'famous', 'was', 'better', 'staying', 'home', 'being', 'nothing', 'sad', 'However', 'Sparkle', 'younger', 'sister', 'went', 'success', 'mother', 'learned', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'supportive', 'other', 'sister', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'did', 'teach', 'right', 'grip', 'fear', 'was', 'too', 'tight', 'almost', 'ruined', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'lead', 'singer', 'Good', 'job', 'Whitney', 'Sad', 'lead', 'singer', 'had', 'go', 'prison', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'be', 'alright', 'too', 'Whitney', 'was', 'now', 'visiting', 'thought', 'like', 'more', 'more', 'abuse', 'emphasis', 'lead', 'singer', 'sex', 'appeal', 'was', 'little', 'raunchy', 'sad', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'movie', 'reflect', 'Whitney', 'life', 'fame', 'fruits', 'exposure']",N/A
