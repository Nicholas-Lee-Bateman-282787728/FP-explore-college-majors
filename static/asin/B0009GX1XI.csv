905305,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B0009GX1XI,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[1, 1]","The plot of this film is similar to the &#34;A movie&#34; plot of Demi Moore's STRIPTEASE.  A stripper (Josie Hunter) wants to get custody of her daughter, but the deck is stacked against her due to her occupation as an exotic dancer.  Unlike the bigger budget STRIPTEASE, this flick is WAY hotter and (believe it or not!) a better movie!Josie Hunter is exquisite.  Like Micah Ashley, she can walk around with her blonde hair casually combed and she's still(!) drop-dead gorgeous.  If you like lots of nudity in your B movie flicks, then you cannot go wrong w/this one.  It is NOT a &#34;teaser&#34; flick as every babe in the movie strips down @ one time or another and there's not a homely woman in the bunch!  If nothing else, this flick is not short on eye candy.One of the most remarkable things about the film is that it actually has a lawyer & a strip club owners who are good(!) guys.  Whoa!!  I didn't think that was possible, but they pulled it off!!  Usually,  lawyers & strip club owners are slimy & sleazy, but that's actually not the case here.  The lawyer is actually a &#34;knight in shining armor&#34; type of guy;  the same type of fellow that I've tried to be myself for damsels-in-distress.If you're not aroused 30 seconds into watching this movie, then you may as well stop watching as the rest of the movie is more of the same.  However, if you're not aroused, then I have to question what your intentions were in buying a movie like this.  Again, while the women may not be going up for an Academy Award for best actress, that's really not the &#34;point&#34; here.  It's an enjoyable movie and it's not short on beautiful naked women.  Who could ask for anything more????",5,Thank you Josie!!,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,1695,"['plot', 'film', 'similar', '34', 'A', 'movie', '34', 'plot', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'STRIPTEASE', 'stripper', 'Josie', 'Hunter', 'get', 'custody', 'daughter', 'deck', 'stacked', 'due', 'occupation', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'bigger', 'budget', 'STRIPTEASE', 'flick', 'WAY', 'hotter', 'believe', 'not', 'better', 'movie', 'Josie', 'Hunter', 'exquisite', 'Micah', 'Ashley', 'can', 'walk', 'blonde', 'hair', 'casually', 'combed', 'still', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'like', 'lots', 'nudity', 'B', 'movie', 'flicks', 'then', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'w/this', 'one', 'NOT', '34', 'teaser', '34', 'flick', 'babe', 'movie', 'down', '@', 'one', 'time', 'not', 'homely', 'woman', 'bunch', 'nothing', 'else', 'flick', 'not', 'short', 'eye', 'candy.One', 'most', 'remarkable', 'things', 'film', 'actually', 'lawyer', 'strip', 'club', 'owners', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'Whoa', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'possible', 'pulled', 'off', 'Usually', 'lawyers', 'strip', 'club', 'owners', 'are', 'slimy', 'sleazy', 'actually', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'lawyer', 'actually', '34', 'knight', 'shining', 'armor', '34', 'type', 'guy', 'same', 'type', 'fellow', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'be', 'damsels-in-distress.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'aroused', '30', 'seconds', 'watching', 'movie', 'then', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'stop', 'watching', 'rest', 'movie', 'more', 'same', 'However', ""'re"", 'not', 'aroused', 'then', 'have', 'question', 'what', 'intentions', 'were', 'buying', 'movie', 'Again', 'women', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'going', 'up', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actress', 'really', 'not', '34', 'point', '34', 'here', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'not', 'short', 'beautiful', 'naked', 'women', 'Who', 'could', 'ask', 'anything', 'more']",Confessions of a Lap Dancer

905308,AZ4LKSFJ5XEI3,B0009GX1XI,"Pei Chia Li ""Garrett""","[9, 14]","I ordered this title from amazon.com, when it arrived from Clover Media, I first tried to play it on a new Sony DVD player I bought at amazon.com, and it would only play about 4 or 5 minutes before it froze. I tried fast forward and skip, and that was futile. I just watched another new DVD that evening. In a few days, I tried it on my new all-region Panasonic player from amazon.com. It played about 16 minutes before it froze. I have two more Sony DVD players from Sears and Wal-Mart, and it did the same on them. I wasn't sure how to return it, so I sent Clover Media an e-mail asking about it. They didn't reply but just complained about me. That's grossly unfair. I won't ever do business with them again. I couldn't find instructions on amazon.com about returns, so I just sent it back to the address on the original package. It has been a couple of weeks, and it hasn't been returned to me, and I haven't heard from Clover Media either. I don't know what to think or do now. I'm not ordering any more items from amazon.com until this situation is resolved. I put some items on my wish list for now to order when or if the situation is resolved.I RATE THE TRANSACTION MINUS FIVE SINCE I GOT A DVD THAT WON""T PLAY; I CAN'T FIND INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT RETURNS; I E-MAILED CLOVER MEDIA ABOUT IT; THEY IGNORED ME AND COMPLAINED ABOUT ME; AND I'M STILL UP IN THE AIR ABOUT IT.",1,IT WON'T PLAY on any of my 4 DVD players.,1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,1374,"['ordered', 'title', 'amazon.com', 'when', 'arrived', 'Clover', 'Media', 'first', 'tried', 'play', 'new', 'Sony', 'DVD', 'player', 'bought', 'amazon.com', 'would', 'only', 'play', 'about', '4', '5', 'minutes', 'tried', 'fast', 'forward', 'skip', 'was', 'futile', 'just', 'watched', 'new', 'DVD', 'evening', 'few', 'days', 'tried', 'new', 'all-region', 'Panasonic', 'player', 'amazon.com', 'played', '16', 'minutes', 'have', 'two', 'more', 'Sony', 'DVD', 'players', 'Sears', 'Wal-Mart', 'did', 'same', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'return', 'sent', 'Clover', 'Media', 'e-mail', 'asking', 'did', ""n't"", 'reply', 'just', 'complained', 'grossly', 'unfair', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'do', 'business', 'again', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'instructions', 'amazon.com', 'returns', 'just', 'sent', 'back', 'address', 'original', 'package', 'been', 'couple', 'weeks', ""n't"", 'been', 'returned', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Clover', 'Media', 'either', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'do', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'ordering', 'more', 'items', 'amazon.com', 'situation', 'resolved', 'put', 'items', 'wish', 'list', 'now', 'order', 'when', 'situation', 'resolved.I', 'RATE', 'THE', 'TRANSACTION', 'MINUS', 'FIVE', 'SINCE', 'GOT', 'DVD', 'THAT', 'WON', 'T', 'PLAY', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'FIND', 'INSTRUCTIONS', 'ABOUT', 'RETURNS', 'E-MAILED', 'CLOVER', 'MEDIA', 'ABOUT', 'IT', 'THEY', 'IGNORED', 'ME', 'AND', 'COMPLAINED', 'ABOUT', 'ME', ""'M"", 'STILL', 'UP', 'IN', 'THE', 'AIR', 'IT']",Confessions of a Lap Dancer

905310,A2MF0N72JVXDAP,B0009GX1XI,The Phantom,"[7, 7]","OK, so it's a hot stripper flick with a lot of naked women and, for its 1997 release, surprising in its explicitness. On that point alone it could have landed four stars if not five.But what will surprise you is the depth of characterization and the superior writing. I've seen tons of major releases that aren't written, directed or acted this well.Josie Hunter's turn as the lead character is--dare I say it--almost brilliant. Her dialogue delivery is a little stilted at times but you can tell so much that she really connected with the stripper-slash-hooker-slash-mother. I mean for God's sake, she was crying during the sex scenes, while her body is doing one thing but her mind something else.The story really takes us places, shows us how screwed up some women can be in the head when it comes to sexuality and love and emotions and motherhood. As much as we would like it to be the case, sometimes there are no easy answers. Erica has it all there in front of her and the audience can't figure out why she just doesn't take the best way out of her predicament. Yet she keeps on getting in more deeply even though she hates what she does and hates herself for doing it.This is very realistic. Reminds me of one of my ex girlfriends actually.The worst part of the movie probably is its title, which brings to mind much cheaper recent soft-core fare.",5,Startling how good it really is,1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,1355,"['OK', 'hot', 'stripper', 'flick', 'lot', 'naked', 'women', '1997', 'release', 'surprising', 'explicitness', 'point', 'alone', 'could', 'have', 'landed', 'four', 'stars', 'not', 'five.But', 'what', 'will', 'surprise', 'depth', 'characterization', 'superior', 'writing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'tons', 'major', 'releases', 'are', ""n't"", 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'well.Josie', 'Hunter', 'turn', 'lead', 'character', 'dare', 'say', 'almost', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', 'delivery', 'little', 'stilted', 'times', 'can', 'tell', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'connected', 'stripper-slash-hooker-slash-mother', 'mean', 'God', 'sake', 'was', 'crying', 'sex', 'scenes', 'body', 'doing', 'one', 'thing', 'mind', 'something', 'else.The', 'story', 'really', 'places', 'how', 'screwed', 'up', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'head', 'when', 'sexuality', 'love', 'emotions', 'motherhood', 'As', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'case', 'sometimes', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'Erica', 'there', 'front', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'just', ""n't"", 'take', 'best', 'way', 'predicament', 'getting', 'more', 'deeply', 'even', 'what', 'doing', 'it.This', 'very', 'realistic', 'Reminds', 'one', 'ex', 'girlfriends', 'actually.The', 'worst', 'part', 'movie', 'probably', 'title', 'mind', 'much', 'cheaper', 'recent', 'soft-core', 'fare']",Confessions of a Lap Dancer
