I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning about the life of this humble person who did amazing things.  Even if one is not Catholic, it's a good movie about a real person.Recommended book available on Amazon:  Saint Joseph of Copertino by Angelo Pastrovicchi.The film does not show some of his more public flying &#8230; many people on different occasions saw him  float  (fly) above the ground, including crowds of people, friars, and even the Pope.This 1962 film is in black and white.  The DVD is an excellent transfer with a very clear picture,  contrast, and audio.  The sound quality is very good.  The language is English.  The acting is good and the story is entertaining, although some liberties were taken &#8211; not every scene is 100% factual.However, the movie is based on historical events.  Due to his mental challenges, mother did not want him and he was assigned as a stable boy at a friary.  St. Joseph of Cupertino (Copertino, Italy) was a real person and he did miraculous uncontrolled flying in churches and outside in public, which led him to be scrutinized by Inquisition, and hidden away from people by his religious order.He had his share of troubles and temptations.  His path to sainthood was not instantaneous&#8230; it was an arduous road.  Due to his gifts of the Spirit and the challenges he overcame, he is the patron saint of aviators, astronauts, students, and those mentally challenged and forgetful.Below is from sanfrancisco.asu.edu:On October 4, 1630, the town of Cupertino held a procession on the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi. Joseph was assisting in the procession when he suddenly soared into the sky, where he remained hovering over the crowd. When he descended and realized what had happened, he became so embarrassed that he fled to his mother's house and hid. This was the first of many flights, which soon earned him the nickname &#34;the Flying Saint.&#34; However, Joseph also found himself in trouble for returning home with a torn habit when people who regarded him as a prophet or a saint sought relics.Joseph's life changed dramatically. His flights continued and came with increasing frequency. On hearing the names of Jesus or Mary, the singing of hymns during the feast of St. Francis, or while praying at Mass, he would go into a dazed state and soar into the air, remaining there until a superior commanded him to revive. His most famous flight occurred during an audience before Pope Urban VIII. When he bent down to kiss the Pope's feet, he was suddenly filled with reverence for Christ's Vicar on earth, and was lifted into the air. Only when the Minister General of the Order, who was part of the audience, ordered him down was Joseph able to return to the floor.",5,"Great movie based on historical figure.

It has amazing performances from great actors such as Maximilian Schell and Ricardo Montalban, and would suit anyone who likes a good movie. If anyone is Catholic, this is especially a great movie, orthodox to its core and accurate with the life of this amazing saint, Saint Joseph of Cupertino (the patron saint of astronauts,pilots, and students preparing for exams--watch the movie to see why). There is nothing weak about this movie. It is especially great in showing how the virtue of humility is the most important in one's efforts to attain holiness and how we are called to do what God wants us to do, not what we want to do. It also shows that anyone can become a saint and also that we should never put our own ambitions above what God wants us to do, or what God is calling others to do, no matter how great or small the task may be.",5,The best Catholic movie ever made,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,872,"['true', 'gem', 'movie', 'amazing', 'performances', 'great', 'actors', 'such', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'would', 'suit', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'movie', 'anyone', 'Catholic', 'especially', 'great', 'movie', 'orthodox', 'core', 'accurate', 'life', 'amazing', 'saint', 'Saint', 'Joseph', 'Cupertino', 'patron', 'saint', 'astronauts', 'pilots', 'students', 'preparing', 'exams', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'why', 'nothing', 'weak', 'movie', 'especially', 'great', 'showing', 'how', 'virtue', 'humility', 'most', 'important', 'one', 'efforts', 'attain', 'holiness', 'how', 'are', 'called', 'do', 'what', 'God', 'do', 'not', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'also', 'anyone', 'can', 'become', 'saint', 'also', 'should', 'never', 'put', 'own', 'ambitions', 'what', 'God', 'do', 'what', 'God', 'calling', 'others', 'do', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'small', 'task', 'may', 'be']",N/A
