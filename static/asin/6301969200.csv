She does her own singing in this and is not dubbed (as she was in With a Song in My Heart).  This is another hindrance, however.  Hayward's deep, throaty vocals fall flat at times.  Its her performance that counts however and she turns in a fine one (although I prefer her Angelica Evans in Smash-Up).The movie gets a little frustrating at times because one finds it hard to feel much sympathy for Roth as she is her own worst enemy.

Lillian has the entire showbusiness world at her feet, until the early death of childhood sweetheart David (Ray Danton) triggers her spiral into depression and eventually alcoholism.  The 1950's was well and truly a banner decade for Susan Hayward.  In addition to her Academy Award-nominated turn in I'LL CRY TOMORROW, Hayward was also applauded for her performance as another real-life singing sensation, Jane Froman in ""With a Song in My Heart"" (1952) and later played jailed death-row victim Barbara Graham in ""I Want to Live!"" (1959).I'LL CRY TOMORROW was crafted from the first volume of Lillian Roth's autobiography.  Roth subsequently got her act together, became one of the first celebrity members of Alcoholics Anonymous and starred on Broadway in such shows as ""I Can Get It for You Wholesale"" and ""70, Girls, 70"".Watching Susan Hayward going through her paces as Roth is like witnessing an Olympic athlete at the peak of their prowess.  It's quite simply an electric performance.  For the first and only time in her screen career, Hayward sang using her real singing voice, delivering the goods with such Roth standards as ""Sing, You Sinners"", ""When the Red-Red Robin..."" and ""Happiness is Just a Thing Called Joe"".  So successful was Hayward's foray into the musical world that MGM wanted her to sign a long-term recording contract, but Hayward didn't want to interrupt her film career, which was on a personal high after her appearance in I'LL CRY TOMORROW.Jo Van Fleet is astonishingly good as Lillian's pushy stage mother Katie (she never received an Academy Award nomination; instead winning the 'Best Supporting Actress' award for her role as James Dean's mother in ""East of Eden"" which was released in the same year).  Richard Conte (""The Blue Gardenia"") is Lillian's abusive third husband Tony Bardeman, and Eddie Albert is her A/A saviour Burt McGuire--playing opposite real-life wife Margo for the first and only time in his career.The DVD includes footage from the premiere (with both Hayward and Roth in attendance), portions from the ""MGM Parade"" TV show, the theatrical trailer; and the 1934 VitaPhone musical short ""Story Conference"" starring Lillian Roth.",4,"""My life was never my own--it was charted before I was born""",1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,2317,"[""'LL"", 'CRY', 'TOMORROW', '1955', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'out', 'stops', 'Lillian', 'Roth', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'songbirds', '1930s', 'Lillian', 'entire', 'showbusiness', 'world', 'feet', 'early', 'death', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'David', 'Ray', 'Danton', 'spiral', 'depression', 'eventually', 'alcoholism', '1950', 'was', 'well', 'truly', 'banner', 'decade', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'addition', 'Academy', 'Award-nominated', 'turn', ""'LL"", 'CRY', 'TOMORROW', 'Hayward', 'was', 'also', 'applauded', 'performance', 'real-life', 'singing', 'sensation', 'Jane', 'Froman', 'Song', 'My', 'Heart', '1952', 'later', 'played', 'jailed', 'death-row', 'victim', 'Barbara', 'Graham', 'Want', 'Live', '1959', '.I', 'CRY', 'TOMORROW', 'was', 'crafted', 'first', 'volume', 'Lillian', 'Roth', 'autobiography', 'Roth', 'subsequently', 'got', 'act', 'together', 'became', 'one', 'first', 'celebrity', 'members', 'Alcoholics', 'Anonymous', 'starred', 'Broadway', 'such', 'shows', 'Can', 'Get', 'Wholesale', '70', 'Girls', '70', '.Watching', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'going', 'paces', 'Roth', 'witnessing', 'Olympic', 'athlete', 'peak', 'prowess', 'quite', 'simply', 'electric', 'performance', 'first', 'only', 'time', 'screen', 'career', 'Hayward', 'sang', 'using', 'real', 'singing', 'voice', 'delivering', 'goods', 'such', 'Roth', 'standards', 'Sing', 'Sinners', 'When', 'Red-Red', 'Robin', 'Happiness', 'Just', 'Thing', 'Called', 'Joe', 'So', 'successful', 'was', 'Hayward', 'foray', 'musical', 'world', 'MGM', 'wanted', 'sign', 'long-term', 'recording', 'contract', 'Hayward', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'interrupt', 'film', 'career', 'was', 'personal', 'high', 'appearance', ""'LL"", 'CRY', 'TOMORROW.Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'Lillian', 'pushy', 'stage', 'mother', 'Katie', 'never', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'instead', 'winning', ""'Best"", 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'award', 'role', 'James', 'Dean', 'mother', 'East', 'Eden', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'Richard', 'Conte', 'Blue', 'Gardenia', 'Lillian', 'abusive', 'third', 'husband', 'Tony', 'Bardeman', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'A/A', 'saviour', 'Burt', 'McGuire', 'playing', 'opposite', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Margo', 'first', 'only', 'time', 'career.The', 'DVD', 'footage', 'premiere', 'Hayward', 'Roth', 'attendance', 'portions', 'MGM', 'Parade', 'TV', 'show', 'theatrical', 'trailer', '1934', 'VitaPhone', 'musical', 'short', 'Story', 'Conference', 'starring', 'Lillian', 'Roth']",N/A

Susan Hayward, ever the actress of the hour when it came to tragic bio-pics filmed in the 1950's, does a fine Academy Award nominated job portraying the woman whose mother, brilliantly played by Jo Van Fleet, literally wrecked her life and brought her to absolute ruin. The film takes many liberties with the telling of her life story but it does so to absolute believability. The cast, who also includes Ray Danton, Don Taylor, Richard Conte, Eddie Albert and Margo is wonderful in support of the main character.  Lillian Roth had been controlled by her clutching, grasping, selfish and frightening &#34;stage mother&#34; from a very young age, who pushed her talented child out into the public eye never taking the child herself into consideration in any way. As Lillian comes of age, she falls in love, marries against her mother's wishes, loses her husband...who had been her childhood sweetheart, to a brain tumor, and stumbles into a dependence on alcohol in very short order. We are given a glimpse into a life of total despair where a once promising,very talented and beautiful girl turns into a raging alcoholic who is robbed of everything she ever had.

280247,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6301969200,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","This film kind of took me aback because I never associated MGM with pictures of such a frank nature.  ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" is a film that meticulously depicts the hold that alcohol takes that slowly but inevitably leads to complete degradation, at least in the case of Lillian Roth.  It's also an inspirational film in that it does offer hope that you can escape from the prison that the bottle offers.  The film at first depicts the alleged glamour of drinking.  For instance, Roth would go out on the town and order dinner but not eat it and just drink.  Gradually the constant drinking led to seedy flophouses on skid row.  The acting here is superb.  Susan Hayward's character is required to age maybe 25 years and she does it convincingly with no make-up effects.  Hayward's not what I would call a conventional beauty, at least not in the Lana Turner-Rita Hayworth sense, but through sheer force of personality you believe her to be glamorous.  Hayward's singing voice I found to be adequate at best but she pulls it off because she makes you believe she is a terrific singer.  Great supporting work by Jo Van Fleet as Lillian's stage mother mom.  Van Fleet won the Oscar that year for ""East of Eden"" but you can make a stronger case for her work here.  The underappreciated Richard Conte is also superb as Roth's abusive second husband.  There have been many great films about the pitfalls of alcohol and ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" stands with the best of them.",5,Harrowing Tale Of Addiction,1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,1460,"['film', 'kind', 'took', 'aback', 'never', 'associated', 'MGM', 'pictures', 'frank', 'nature', ""'ll"", 'Cry', 'Tomorrow', 'film', 'meticulously', 'hold', 'slowly', 'inevitably', 'complete', 'degradation', 'least', 'case', 'Lillian', 'Roth', 'also', 'inspirational', 'film', 'offer', 'hope', 'can', 'escape', 'prison', 'bottle', 'offers', 'film', 'first', 'alleged', 'glamour', 'drinking', 'instance', 'Roth', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'town', 'order', 'dinner', 'not', 'eat', 'just', 'drink', 'Gradually', 'constant', 'drinking', 'led', 'seedy', 'flophouses', 'skid', 'row', 'acting', 'here', 'superb', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'character', 'required', 'age', 'maybe', '25', 'years', 'convincingly', 'make-up', 'effects', 'Hayward', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'conventional', 'beauty', 'least', 'not', 'Lana', 'Turner-Rita', 'Hayworth', 'sense', 'sheer', 'force', 'personality', 'believe', 'be', 'glamorous', 'Hayward', 'singing', 'voice', 'found', 'be', 'adequate', 'best', 'off', 'believe', 'terrific', 'singer', 'Great', 'supporting', 'work', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'Lillian', 'stage', 'mother', 'mom', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'won', 'Oscar', 'year', 'East', 'Eden', 'can', 'make', 'stronger', 'case', 'work', 'here', 'underappreciated', 'Richard', 'Conte', 'also', 'superb', 'Roth', 'abusive', 'second', 'husband', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'pitfalls', 'alcohol', ""'ll"", 'Cry', 'Tomorrow', 'best']",N/A
280248,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,6301969200,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[5, 5]","I just saw ""I'LL CRY TOMORROW"" on TCM. I can't say that I found it particularly ""enjoyable"", but you've got to love Susan Hayward. I always loved Susan Hayward for her absolute fearlessness on film. She was not afraid to go to the dark places in the soul. Her characters and films frequently had a toughness, a gritiness to them.  Life was rude and relentless to Susan (on film and in reality)). I always think of Susan (on film and in reality) as a lady who took many slaps to the face and punches in the gut, but who came out swinging and fighting every time.Many people championed Bette Davis with being so brave and fearless.Some reviewers feel that Susan's take on alcoholic singer Lillian Roth  here is too full of Bette Davis-like histrionics and mannerisims. I strongly disagree. I hate movies like ""HARVEY"" and ""ARTHUR"" that make alcoholism seem like such a ""fun past-time."" This film definitely takes the different route. Susan takes Lillian Roth's alcoholism and throws it in your face, in all of its sordid ugliness and despair, and never once does she ask or beg the audience for sympathy.We first see Susan as Lilian Roth  belt out (and that's Susan's real singing voice) ""Sing, You Sinners!"" That's early in the film, and it's the last moment of joy Lillian/Susan and the audience are going to get. I might have hit the bottle myself if I had a stage mother like Jo Van Fleet. But it's not mother that drives Lillian to drink.Denied a chance at happiness with her beloved David, (Ray Danton),  Lillian, at first, needs a drink to get to sleep at night. Then she needs drinks to get through each day. Lillian brawls and boozes with two husbands.It appears that second husband Tony (Richard Conte) likely beat and raped her in a drunken rage of his own on a train trip, but the film is never too specific about the outcome of the brutal scene on the train.Susan Hayward gets as unglamourous as an actress can get in a film, as she becomes the personification of the ""falling down drunk."" Susan makes James Mason's drunk Norman Maine in the 1954 ""A STAR IS BORN"" look like a day at the beach with a picnic lunch! Eventually, she tries to throw herself out of a hotel window. She cries, ""God help me!"" and then falls backwards off the window and back into the room.I kept wishing she would stumble into AA. But, ironically, the scenes where she does find help from AA and Eddie Albert don't ring as true as the nightmarish years that precede her sobriety. ""I'LL CRY TOMORROW"" is every bit as harrowing as Susan's work in ""I WANT TO LIVE!"", where Barbara Graham goes to the gas chamber.Liliian Roth survives at  the end of ""I'LL CRY TOMORROW"", but only just barely survives. ""I'LL CRY TOMORROW"" belongs on the short list of films like ""DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES""and ""LEAVING LAS VEGAS"" that seriously make you think two and three times about having ""just one little drink.""",4,"ONE DRINK IS TOO MANY AND  A THOUSAND IS NOT ENOUGH; BUT BRAVO, SUSAN HAYWARD!",1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,2880,"['just', 'saw', ""'LL"", 'CRY', 'TOMORROW', 'TCM', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'found', 'particularly', 'enjoyable', ""'ve"", 'got', 'love', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'always', 'loved', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'absolute', 'fearlessness', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'go', 'dark', 'places', 'soul', 'characters', 'films', 'frequently', 'had', 'toughness', 'gritiness', 'Life', 'was', 'rude', 'relentless', 'Susan', 'film', 'reality', 'always', 'think', 'Susan', 'film', 'reality', 'lady', 'who', 'took', 'many', 'slaps', 'face', 'punches', 'gut', 'who', 'came', 'out', 'swinging', 'fighting', 'time.Many', 'people', 'championed', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'being', 'so', 'brave', 'fearless.Some', 'reviewers', 'feel', 'Susan', 'take', 'alcoholic', 'singer', 'Lillian', 'Roth', 'here', 'too', 'full', 'Bette', 'Davis-like', 'histrionics', 'mannerisims', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'hate', 'movies', 'HARVEY', 'ARTHUR', 'make', 'alcoholism', 'seem', 'fun', 'past-time', 'film', 'definitely', 'different', 'route', 'Susan', 'Lillian', 'Roth', 'alcoholism', 'face', 'sordid', 'ugliness', 'despair', 'never', 'once', 'ask', 'beg', 'audience', 'sympathy.We', 'first', 'see', 'Susan', 'Lilian', 'Roth', 'belt', 'out', 'Susan', 'real', 'singing', 'voice', 'Sing', 'Sinners', 'early', 'film', 'last', 'moment', 'joy', 'Lillian/Susan', 'audience', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'might', 'have', 'hit', 'bottle', 'had', 'stage', 'mother', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'not', 'Lillian', 'drink.Denied', 'chance', 'happiness', 'beloved', 'David', 'Ray', 'Danton', 'Lillian', 'first', 'drink', 'get', 'sleep', 'night', 'Then', 'drinks', 'get', 'day', 'Lillian', 'brawls', 'two', 'husbands.It', 'second', 'husband', 'Tony', 'Richard', 'Conte', 'likely', 'beat', 'raped', 'drunken', 'rage', 'own', 'train', 'trip', 'film', 'never', 'too', 'specific', 'outcome', 'brutal', 'scene', 'train.Susan', 'Hayward', 'as', 'unglamourous', 'actress', 'can', 'get', 'film', 'personification', 'falling', 'down', 'drunk', 'Susan', 'James', 'Mason', 'drunk', 'Norman', 'Maine', '1954', 'STAR', 'IS', 'BORN', 'look', 'day', 'beach', 'picnic', 'lunch', 'Eventually', 'throw', 'hotel', 'window', 'God', 'help', 'then', 'backwards', 'window', 'back', 'room.I', 'kept', 'wishing', 'would', 'stumble', 'AA', 'ironically', 'scenes', 'where', 'find', 'help', 'AA', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'do', ""n't"", 'ring', 'as', 'true', 'nightmarish', 'years', 'precede', 'sobriety', ""'LL"", 'CRY', 'TOMORROW', 'bit', 'as', 'harrowing', 'Susan', 'work', 'WANT', 'TO', 'LIVE', 'where', 'Barbara', 'Graham', 'gas', 'chamber.Liliian', 'Roth', 'end', ""'LL"", 'CRY', 'TOMORROW', 'only', 'just', 'barely', ""'LL"", 'CRY', 'TOMORROW', 'short', 'list', 'films', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'WINE', 'AND', 'ROSES', 'LEAVING', 'LAS', 'VEGAS', 'seriously', 'make', 'think', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'having', 'just', 'one', 'little', 'drink']",N/A
280249,A3A03ETOTJRR0T,6301969200,DonnaReviews,"[8, 14]","""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" is a biopic about Lillian Roth (played in adulthood by Susan Hayward), a singer pushed to child stardom by her relentless stage mother and plunged into alcoholism after becoming a ""big star"" as an adult. It's fairly effective in spite of Susan Hayward's histrionics and deliciously enjoyable because of them.Hayward is rather an anomaly.  She has a Dresden doll pretty face yet this gruff voice (reminiscent of Barbara Stanwyck, a fellow Brooklynite) and somewhat tough-girl-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks behavior.  She also has a tendency to overdo the emoting like nobody's business, alternately widening eyes or squinting, tossing her head.  Her artificiality is reminiscent almost of silent screen acting like Garbo was famous for, except that Garbo's style was appropriate for the silent era and Hayward is in a whole other era where it just looks odd.  When she sneers, ""Ah, shaddap"" at one point in the worst imitation of a gun moll, I gave in and started laughing.  Then I really began to enjoy her.  I thought that if she's this over the top in the beginning, she'll be deliciously off the charts in the second half when her character's alcoholism progresses.  Surprisingly, she actually got really good in the later half where the excessive emoting works.  It then became a wrenching and sometimes even chilling portrait of alcohlism.As for the singing - first, what's with that Egyptian cakewalk choreography?  Fingers splayed, elbows up, walking grapevine step.  In the right key, as with the song ""Happiness is a Thing Called Joe,"" she isn't bad but in some of those opening numbers that require lots of belting and chord changes -- the flat notes can jar.  Unlike Judy Garland who could sing and act and do both amazingly, Hayward is flirting on the side of bad taste. But ultimately that's part of her appeal. She's perfect for tawdry melodrama and great fun to watch.  She really does give it her all, camp tendencies notwithstanding.  Life piles it on and she perseveres.Film fans should seek this out.",3,Fun Biopic with Over-Wrought Hayward,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,2043,"[""'ll"", 'Cry', 'Tomorrow', 'biopic', 'Lillian', 'Roth', 'played', 'adulthood', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'singer', 'pushed', 'child', 'stardom', 'relentless', 'stage', 'mother', 'plunged', 'alcoholism', 'becoming', 'big', 'star', 'adult', 'fairly', 'effective', 'spite', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'histrionics', 'deliciously', 'enjoyable', 'them.Hayward', 'rather', 'anomaly', 'Dresden', 'doll', 'pretty', 'face', 'yet', 'gruff', 'voice', 'reminiscent', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'fellow', 'Brooklynite', 'somewhat', 'tough-girl-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks', 'behavior', 'also', 'tendency', 'overdo', 'emoting', 'nobody', 'business', 'alternately', 'widening', 'eyes', 'squinting', 'tossing', 'head', 'artificiality', 'reminiscent', 'almost', 'silent', 'screen', 'acting', 'Garbo', 'was', 'famous', 'Garbo', 'style', 'was', 'appropriate', 'silent', 'era', 'Hayward', 'whole', 'other', 'era', 'where', 'just', 'odd', 'When', 'Ah', 'shaddap', 'one', 'point', 'worst', 'imitation', 'gun', 'moll', 'gave', 'started', 'laughing', 'Then', 'really', 'began', 'enjoy', 'thought', 'top', 'beginning', ""'ll"", 'be', 'deliciously', 'charts', 'second', 'half', 'when', 'character', 'alcoholism', 'Surprisingly', 'actually', 'got', 'really', 'good', 'later', 'half', 'where', 'excessive', 'emoting', 'works', 'then', 'became', 'wrenching', 'sometimes', 'even', 'chilling', 'portrait', 'alcohlism.As', 'singing', 'first', 'what', 'Egyptian', 'cakewalk', 'choreography', 'Fingers', 'splayed', 'up', 'walking', 'grapevine', 'step', 'right', 'key', 'song', 'Happiness', 'Thing', 'Called', 'Joe', ""n't"", 'bad', 'opening', 'numbers', 'require', 'lots', 'belting', 'chord', 'changes', 'flat', 'notes', 'can', 'jar', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'who', 'could', 'sing', 'act', 'do', 'amazingly', 'Hayward', 'flirting', 'side', 'bad', 'taste', 'ultimately', 'part', 'appeal', 'perfect', 'tawdry', 'melodrama', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'really', 'give', 'camp', 'tendencies', 'notwithstanding', 'Life', 'perseveres.Film', 'fans', 'should', 'seek', 'out']",N/A

It's one of those roles that every actress must dream of getting, and Hayward really sinks her teeth into it.  She goes from glamour to degradation, with a very realistic portrayal of Roth's descent into alcoholism.  She puts everything into it, and her performance is forceful and truthful.  Jo Van Fleet is also terrific as her grasping mother, too eager to give her daughter the life she never had, and her scenes with Hayward are among the best in the film.

Haywardlost the Oscar to Anna Magnini, but ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" has arguably outlasted the other movie.  (B. Lancaster'sembarrassing turn as the studly, vaguely retarded male lead in ""The Rose Tattoo"" hasn't helped the movie.)But to the point:  Susan Hayward was perhaps not a great actress, yet this is a great performance.  A talentedactress, she had honed her skills carefully, playing everything from spitfires to girl-next-door.  in ""I'll CryTomorrow,"" though, she let go of the reins and threw herself head first into this part.  She and Jo Van Fleet(who is brilliant), go at each other with such vigor that the viewer almost believes the words are being said forthe first time.  (There's a scene in which the two grapple over a liquor bottle so hard that the liquid sloshes outof the bottle and onto Hayward's hand.  Susan goes right on, flicking off the scotch,  so much into thescene that she steps all over Jo Van Fleet's lines.  Well, the other actress is right in there battling, and sheholds her composure and finally grabs Hayward's arm to draw the actress back into the scene.)  It's riveting.No female star had ever gone down so far in a performance of degredation, and Hayward goes for the heartof it.  Totally without makeup, her hair greasy and her freckles showing, Hayward delivers a barnburner of aperformance in the big scenes with van Fleeet, but she's also expert at the quiet moments.Plus all this, Hayward sings, and we buy her as a professional singer: amazing that a dramatic actress showsus another string to her bow at that stage in her career.  So.  It's a a beautifully directed, well-enough writtenfilm about Lillian Roth.  The selling point, though is Susan Hayward's I'll-dive-off-a-cliff performance.  Don'tmiss it.  She got the Oscar three years later, but it should have gone to her for this one.

280266,A2X25C107CSLOR,6301969200,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[9, 22]","The biopic is a corrupt movie genre. Do they ever get it right?! Probably the worst offence against the life of a singer is to cast an actress who cannot sing, and this is the downfall of this film. For whilst I have never seen or heard Lillian Roth perform, I can guess that she needed to have more going for her than Susan Hayward does in this treatment. It is said that Hayward did her own singing, presumably because it was felt the Jolson Story way, with someone miming the singer's own recordings, is too false. However, Hayward's singing is flat and she sounds as though she is dubbed anyway. The only number that isn't a total embarassment is her rendition of Happiness is a Thing Called Joe, perhaps because it is less demanding and the cameraman spares us the indignity of Hayward trying to dance. One might explain away her lead-footedness with the idea that Roth couldn't dance either, but I remember Hayward's awful dance number in I Want to Live, where that time the camera never left her upper torso. Alcoholism here is said to be a &quot;quarrel with fate&quot;, where the failure to cope with a trauma leads one to drink via self-pity, self-hate, self-destruction. The cataclysmic trauma in Roth's life in this narrative is the loss of a boyfriend when she is 18 (Hayward plays 18 going on 40), though we are given prophetic touches of doom from the beginning, with Roth's stagemother and the Alex North music score. However what is interesting is what starts her drinking. A nurse in Lillian's entourage gives her a bottle to help her sleep and &quot;forget&quot; about the boyf. The nurse herself admits that it's &quot;not in the rule book&quot; but that &quot;she can't think of anything else&quot; to help what appears to be a case of depression. The nurse's action is in response to Hayward delivering a meandering speech about the anguish of time making her forget the face and name (!) of the boyf. (A cynic might think that the nurse should be the one to take a drink after such an earful of stream of consciousness psychodribble). That Lillian is an &quot;adorable&quot; drunk as opposed to a mean drunk isn't much compensation for addictive behaviour, more an obvious sympathy device by the writer of a memoir.  As the representation of a star, director Daniel Mann provides no sense of period and we certainly gain no understanding of Roth's career other than performing one song in a nightclub, and then no longer performing because she's married or drunk. When Hayward takes over from the requisite little girl playing the star as a child (who actually suggests more talent than Hayward offers), we see her doing a movie take, but never hear what becomes of the film.  This kind of makes the final This is Your Life a joke, as generic as the crowd we see in the audience. About the only time Hayward manages to be inspired in her choices is the use of twitches when she is drunk. A silent walk down a street, with her finally falling into a collection of trash cans, is beautifully done, the scene all the better because we're spared the generally uninspired screenplay, reportedly based on Roth's book. As her mother, Jo Van Fleet steals the film, even if she is discarded half way through. Her squinty-eyed Jewish intoned monster of ambition borders on camp, and it's a pity we never get to see the life she wants to spare her daughter, though ironically the life the daughter chooses turns out to be presumably much worse. And Eddie Albert as prospective husband number 3 adds an additional uncomfortableness, apart from his own polio-induced lameness. Perhaps it's the prospect of having to listen to Hayward's vocals for eternity. That would drive anyone to drink.",2,Lillian Roth cries today,995846400,"07 23, 2001",2001,3700,"['biopic', 'corrupt', 'movie', 'genre', 'Do', 'ever', 'get', 'right', 'Probably', 'worst', 'offence', 'life', 'singer', 'cast', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'sing', 'downfall', 'film', 'whilst', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'Lillian', 'Roth', 'perform', 'can', 'guess', 'needed', 'have', 'more', 'going', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'treatment', 'said', 'Hayward', 'did', 'own', 'singing', 'presumably', 'was', 'felt', 'Jolson', 'Story', 'way', 'someone', 'miming', 'singer', 'own', 'recordings', 'too', 'false', 'However', 'Hayward', 'singing', 'flat', 'dubbed', 'anyway', 'only', 'number', ""n't"", 'total', 'embarassment', 'rendition', 'Happiness', 'Thing', 'Called', 'Joe', 'perhaps', 'less', 'demanding', 'cameraman', 'indignity', 'Hayward', 'trying', 'dance', 'One', 'might', 'explain', 'away', 'lead-footedness', 'idea', 'Roth', 'could', ""n't"", 'dance', 'either', 'remember', 'Hayward', 'awful', 'dance', 'number', 'Want', 'Live', 'where', 'time', 'camera', 'never', 'left', 'upper', 'torso', 'Alcoholism', 'here', 'said', 'be', 'quot', 'quarrel', 'fate', 'quot', 'where', 'failure', 'cope', 'trauma', 'one', 'drink', 'self-pity', 'self-hate', 'self-destruction', 'cataclysmic', 'trauma', 'Roth', 'life', 'narrative', 'loss', 'boyfriend', 'when', '18', 'Hayward', '18', 'going', '40', 'are', 'given', 'prophetic', 'touches', 'doom', 'beginning', 'Roth', 'stagemother', 'Alex', 'North', 'music', 'score', 'However', 'what', 'interesting', 'what', 'drinking', 'nurse', 'Lillian', 'entourage', 'bottle', 'help', 'sleep', 'quot', 'forget', 'quot', 'boyf', 'nurse', 'herself', 'quot', 'not', 'rule', 'book', 'quot', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'else', 'quot', 'help', 'what', 'be', 'case', 'depression', 'nurse', 'action', 'response', 'Hayward', 'delivering', 'meandering', 'speech', 'anguish', 'time', 'making', 'forget', 'face', 'name', 'boyf', 'cynic', 'might', 'think', 'nurse', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'take', 'drink', 'such', 'earful', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'psychodribble', 'Lillian', 'quot', 'adorable', 'quot', 'opposed', 'mean', 'drunk', ""n't"", 'much', 'compensation', 'addictive', 'behaviour', 'more', 'obvious', 'sympathy', 'device', 'writer', 'memoir', 'representation', 'star', 'director', 'Daniel', 'Mann', 'sense', 'period', 'certainly', 'gain', 'understanding', 'Roth', 'career', 'other', 'performing', 'one', 'song', 'nightclub', 'then', 'no', 'longer', 'performing', 'married', 'drunk', 'When', 'Hayward', 'requisite', 'little', 'girl', 'playing', 'star', 'child', 'who', 'actually', 'more', 'talent', 'Hayward', 'offers', 'see', 'doing', 'movie', 'take', 'never', 'hear', 'what', 'film', 'kind', 'final', 'Your', 'Life', 'joke', 'as', 'generic', 'crowd', 'see', 'audience', 'only', 'time', 'Hayward', 'be', 'inspired', 'choices', 'use', 'twitches', 'when', 'drunk', 'silent', 'walk', 'street', 'finally', 'falling', 'collection', 'trash', 'cans', 'beautifully', 'done', 'scene', 'better', ""'re"", 'spared', 'generally', 'uninspired', 'screenplay', 'reportedly', 'based', 'Roth', 'book', 'mother', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'film', 'even', 'discarded', 'half', 'way', 'squinty-eyed', 'Jewish', 'intoned', 'monster', 'ambition', 'borders', 'camp', 'pity', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'life', 'spare', 'daughter', 'ironically', 'life', 'daughter', 'out', 'be', 'presumably', 'much', 'worse', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'prospective', 'husband', 'number', '3', 'additional', 'uncomfortableness', 'apart', 'own', 'polio-induced', 'lameness', 'Perhaps', 'prospect', 'having', 'listen', 'Hayward', 'vocals', 'eternity', 'would', 'drive', 'anyone', 'drink']",N/A

Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[12, 15]","The magnificent Hayward, again demonstrating her prowess in portraying alcoholics, this time in the true-life story of chanteuse and general party-girl, Lillian Roth. We begin with Lillian as a little girl, being trotted to all kinds of auditions by her scheming and manipulative stage mother, played by Van Fleet. One thing becomes another and soon Lillian is a star (with a repertoire that includes a much too serious rendition of ""The Red, Red Robin...""), and Mother is pleased to be accumulating the trappings of luxury that she so richly deserves. But, when love enters the picture, Lillian is smitten and all of Mother's plans are threatened with derailment. When Lillian's young lover dies of an unnamed illness, she is devastated and has no interest in performing. But all-powerful Mother wields her strength, telling Lillian to snap out of it. It is a painful decision for Lillian, but she throws her mother out, and as Mother slinks off to the sidelines, Lillian, like her counterpart in ""Smash-Up"", soon takes a wee little drinkee to ease the pain. But as all alcoholics know, one drink is too many and a thousand is not enough, and soon Lillian is on the road to ruin. She gets tossed out of all the classiest places, and wakes up in bed with a strange man - even though they're both fully dressed and in twin beds. She falls under the spell of a Svengali, compellingly played by Conte, who convinces her that it's okay to drink, but just know when to stop. Of course, if that were possible for alcoholics, no one would need AA. She runs away and attempts suicide. But Hayward, being Hayward, survives it all, and with the help of AA (and Hollywood) she's back on top in no time.

Although every known actress in Hollywood wanted to play Lilian Roth's tragic story, Susan is the only candidate. A heavy drinker at the time and a near victim of an overdose of sleeping pills  due to her turbulent divorce and custody battle, Hayward identified strongly with this role. Although Roth was under the assumption she would do the singing, Hayward makes her musical debut here. Her voice is throaty and gusty, much like the woman she was and she does each number with aplomb. This is the Oscar that got away. She deserved the one she received 3 years later, but should have won this one as well being an odds on favorite to win. She consoled herself with Cannes Film Festival Award for the best actress in the world--the first American female to win.Jo Van Fleet makes an indelible impression as the pushy stagemother who never resorts to stereotypes. The high voltage confrontations between mother and daughter are unnerving and the film made during the heaving censored period, is gritty and spares no punches. Hayward is ugly and doesn't mind looking like a woman hitting the bottom of the bottler which makes her performance just that more convincing. It's hard to watch her at times when she hits skid row.This movie was released in soundtrack CD and has been much sought after by fans and movie buffs and thanks to WB Home Video for finally making this a reality. This is Hayward's 3rd role as an alcholic (her first nomination in SMASH UP, and 2nd in MY FOOLISH HEART) were preludes to this realistic no nonsense performance by one of filmdom's greats.A must watch for all!

Nobody could have done it better and nobody today could possibly match Susan's  performance. Miss Hayward could deliver  a line like no other and in this musical tragedy she has all the opportunites to  display her talent.Many critics decried Susan over acted, but no way. She appropriately storms and declares like only she could. But all is not ranting and raving. Susan  has a field day as she delivers singing star Lillian Roth's trademark songs. HAYWARD ACTUALLY SINGS THE SONGS TO THE DELIGHT OF HER FANS AND PRODUCERS OF THE MUCH TOUTED FILM. It is indeed a pleasure to see Susan sway and swing herself to the beat of many old standards.
