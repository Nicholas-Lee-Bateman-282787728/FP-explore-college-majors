955490,A145EDBZDAYY7L,B000C65Z8Y,DR,"[1, 2]","A lot of the 'facts' that this mini-series tries to put across are inaccurate, and on a totally unrelated matter, the lead actress looks nothing like her character. As charming as Poppy Montgomery (from TV's ""Without A Trace"") is, she does not remotely resemble Marilyn Monroe. Also, the storytelling in this biopic seems frightfully rushed; and it seems at times that the film-makers were frantically trying to condense Miss Oates' book. However, the cast is very talented, and make a good job of it. Overall, 2/5. The production design is the real stand-out, however, especially the re-staging of the ""Diamond's Are A Girl's Best Friend"" number from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The song 'Happy Birthday, Mr. President' sang at President Kennedy's birthday part is well done, and (thankfully, rather than making the movie delve into conspiracy theories surrounding Monroe's death) ends the movie.",2,An inaccurate but entertaining biopic,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,895,"['lot', ""'facts"", 'mini-series', 'tries', 'put', 'across', 'are', 'inaccurate', 'totally', 'unrelated', 'matter', 'lead', 'actress', 'nothing', 'character', 'As', 'charming', 'Poppy', 'Montgomery', 'TV', 'Trace', 'not', 'remotely', 'resemble', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Also', 'storytelling', 'biopic', 'frightfully', 'rushed', 'times', 'film-makers', 'were', 'frantically', 'trying', 'condense', 'Miss', 'Oates', 'book', 'However', 'cast', 'very', 'talented', 'make', 'good', 'job', 'Overall', '2/5', 'production', 'design', 'real', 'stand-out', 'however', 'especially', 're-staging', 'Diamond', 'Are', 'A', 'Girl', 'Best', 'Friend', 'number', 'Gentlemen', 'Prefer', 'Blondes', 'song', ""'Happy"", 'Birthday', 'Mr.', 'President', 'sang', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'birthday', 'part', 'well', 'done', 'thankfully', 'rather', 'making', 'movie', 'delve', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'surrounding', 'Monroe', 'death', 'movie']",Blonde
