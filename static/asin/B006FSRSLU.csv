1514822,A2L658RAOSOLDF,B006FSRSLU,Beverly,"[12, 12]","I recently came out of an orthopedic walking boot because I sprained my ankle badly.  My ankle is not strong enough to fully support  my weight for extended periods of time, so I started using this DVD.  I love Susan, she is fun in a qwirky way and she makes me smile.  This DVD consist of two 30 minute workouts and I like them both.  There is enough variety to make the workouts different.  The workouts require a band  which is included with the DVD.  This DVD is good for someone who is recovering from a lower body injury like myself or someone with joint problems.  Everything is done in a chair except on one of the workouts, there is a quick section where you try to stand or lift your butt from the chair while working your chest with the band.  I try to stand if my leg lets me, otherwise I sit and concentrate on my chest.  What you get from this DVD is great stretching exercises from your neck to your feet and also stretching and  exercises for your hands and fingers, You also do a fun cardio segment.  I really enjoy the resistance/strength training and you get to do a good number of reps.  I feel like I am training and rehabbing my body.  The video is great quality, the background is bright and colorful and the music is fantastic.",5,Great for Rehab Workout,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,1251,"['recently', 'came', 'orthopedic', 'walking', 'boot', 'sprained', 'ankle', 'badly', 'ankle', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'fully', 'support', 'weight', 'extended', 'periods', 'time', 'started', 'using', 'DVD', 'love', 'Susan', 'fun', 'qwirky', 'way', 'smile', 'DVD', 'consist', 'two', '30', 'minute', 'workouts', 'like', 'enough', 'variety', 'make', 'workouts', 'different', 'workouts', 'require', 'band', 'included', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'good', 'someone', 'who', 'recovering', 'lower', 'body', 'injury', 'someone', 'joint', 'problems', 'Everything', 'done', 'chair', 'one', 'workouts', 'quick', 'section', 'where', 'try', 'stand', 'lift', 'butt', 'chair', 'working', 'chest', 'band', 'try', 'stand', 'leg', 'otherwise', 'sit', 'concentrate', 'chest', 'What', 'get', 'DVD', 'great', 'stretching', 'exercises', 'neck', 'feet', 'also', 'stretching', 'exercises', 'hands', 'fingers', 'also', 'do', 'fun', 'cardio', 'segment', 'really', 'enjoy', 'resistance/strength', 'training', 'get', 'do', 'good', 'number', 'reps', 'feel', 'am', 'training', 'rehabbing', 'body', 'video', 'great', 'quality', 'background', 'bright', 'colorful', 'music', 'fantastic']",Susan Tuttle: Chair Resistance Band Strength Exercises
