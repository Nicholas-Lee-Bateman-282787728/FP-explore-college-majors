844978,A3R999W3U49EHU,B0002TT0A0,D. Auer,"[0, 0]","Okay, this film is not for everybody.  It encompasses three relationships:  one straight, one gay (at least on one side), and one buddy relationship which may or may not be gay.  And yes, it does include some gorgeous men, some full frontal male nudity, and deals with various aspects of what might be called consensual violence within intimate relationships.  So if any of these subjects disturb you too much, you may not want to see this film.Some of the criticisms in other reviews may be somewhat justified, but these issues do not detract significantly from the film, at least for me.  Also, I believe that some of the jarring editing and camera work is intentional, and feeds the tone of the film.What really blew me away about Shiner (besides the boxer's body) was the way the characters approach sado-masochism, dominance/submission, and fetishes. It's easy to believe that none of them know anything about the world of BDSM, but are just discovering aspects of themselves and defining their own unique relationships, rather than trying to fit into a BDSM ""mould"". This results in a film which is refreshing, enlightening, and very, very special.If you're interested in the subject-matter of this movie, or even just open-minded, you should give this movie a chance.

844979,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B0002TT0A0,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[13, 16]","What an unfortunate mess is ""Shiner.""  I wanted to like this over-the-top, anti-film aspirant, and in fact found a number of moments with powerful resonance.  Sadly, those moments are few and far between.  While I appreciate some of what Calson was attempting, any advantage aspired to by bare bones, no budget cinematography was destroyed with some truly atrocious editing that benefited the movie not at all.While bad acting abounds in low budget (and big budget) cinema, Shiner has some remarkably bad performances that are nearly painful to watch.  In particular the ""straight"" couple Linda and Young Guy.  These are the two most poorly written characters offering almost nothing to the story.  The acting is so abysmal and neither actor seems capable of resisting smirking or cracking up as they drearily drop their lines with an appalling lack of skill.  The choppy editing almost lends the feeling that these roles were entirely gratuitous and dropped in to avoid the films being stereotypically cast as an oddball gay film.  It would have been better off as such.With all that is going wrong for it, there are several performances that seem to capture what Calson was hoping to get.  In particular the  story centering on Bob and Tim.  These are the two most richly drawn characters and offer the most rewards with genuinely captivating performances by Nicholas T. King (Bob) and David Zelinas (Tim).  Tim is a boxer with some serious issues.  Remarkably low self esteem is disguised by an almost cartoon like arrogance that he wears like armour plating.  Obsessed with Tim, the seemingly harmless yet ultimately creepy Bob, stalks the boxer in clasic cat-and-mouse fashion.  When the tables are turned and hunter becomes the hunted, the resulting in the film's only genuine emotional catharsis. In a film so artificially hard-edged (that's a compliment) one character MUST have that revelatory break through (or breakdown, as the case proves here) and the final confrontation between Bob and Tim provide Zelinas and King opportunity to display some real acting chops.As played by Scott Stepp and Derris Nile, Tony and Danny seem to be the focus of the movie, and despite some bravado moments of their own (including one truly disturbing scene revealing the sex/violence obsession), but they can't seem to escape a cartoon-like artifice and it's difficult to look at - or beyond their seeming one note symphony and find anything other than the obvious.Ultimately this same raw material could (and should) be used to tell this story in better fashion.  Alas, there really isn't much to recommend this yet, the performances by Messrs. King and Zelinas, really do offer something special and a glimpse of what might have been and are ultimately worth seeing.",2,What a Mess!,1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,2763,"['What', 'unfortunate', 'mess', 'Shiner', 'wanted', 'like', 'over-the-top', 'anti-film', 'aspirant', 'fact', 'found', 'number', 'moments', 'powerful', 'resonance', 'Sadly', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Calson', 'was', 'attempting', 'advantage', 'aspired', 'bare', 'bones', 'budget', 'cinematography', 'was', 'destroyed', 'truly', 'atrocious', 'editing', 'benefited', 'movie', 'not', 'all.While', 'bad', 'acting', 'abounds', 'low', 'budget', 'big', 'budget', 'cinema', 'Shiner', 'remarkably', 'bad', 'performances', 'are', 'nearly', 'painful', 'watch', 'particular', 'straight', 'couple', 'Linda', 'Young', 'Guy', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'poorly', 'written', 'characters', 'offering', 'almost', 'nothing', 'story', 'acting', 'so', 'abysmal', 'actor', 'capable', 'resisting', 'smirking', 'cracking', 'up', 'drearily', 'drop', 'lines', 'appalling', 'lack', 'skill', 'choppy', 'editing', 'almost', 'feeling', 'roles', 'were', 'entirely', 'gratuitous', 'dropped', 'avoid', 'films', 'being', 'stereotypically', 'cast', 'oddball', 'gay', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'such.With', 'going', 'wrong', 'are', 'several', 'performances', 'seem', 'capture', 'what', 'Calson', 'was', 'hoping', 'get', 'particular', 'story', 'centering', 'Bob', 'Tim', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'richly', 'drawn', 'characters', 'offer', 'most', 'rewards', 'genuinely', 'captivating', 'performances', 'Nicholas', 'T.', 'King', 'Bob', 'David', 'Zelinas', 'Tim', 'Tim', 'boxer', 'serious', 'issues', 'Remarkably', 'low', 'self', 'esteem', 'disguised', 'almost', 'cartoon', 'arrogance', 'armour', 'plating', 'Obsessed', 'Tim', 'seemingly', 'harmless', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'creepy', 'Bob', 'boxer', 'clasic', 'cat-and-mouse', 'fashion', 'When', 'tables', 'are', 'turned', 'hunter', 'hunted', 'resulting', 'film', 'only', 'genuine', 'emotional', 'catharsis', 'film', 'so', 'artificially', 'hard-edged', 'compliment', 'one', 'character', 'MUST', 'have', 'revelatory', 'break', 'breakdown', 'case', 'here', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Bob', 'Tim', 'provide', 'Zelinas', 'King', 'opportunity', 'display', 'real', 'acting', 'chops.As', 'played', 'Scott', 'Stepp', 'Derris', 'Nile', 'Tony', 'Danny', 'seem', 'be', 'focus', 'movie', 'bravado', 'moments', 'own', 'including', 'one', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'revealing', 'sex/violence', 'obsession', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'escape', 'cartoon-like', 'artifice', 'difficult', 'look', 'seeming', 'one', 'note', 'symphony', 'find', 'anything', 'other', 'obvious.Ultimately', 'same', 'raw', 'material', 'could', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'tell', 'story', 'better', 'fashion', 'Alas', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'recommend', 'yet', 'performances', 'Messrs.', 'King', 'Zelinas', 'really', 'do', 'offer', 'something', 'special', 'glimpse', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'ultimately', 'worth', 'seeing']",Shiner

844982,AMWIK6JOWNTHK,B0002TT0A0,Kurt Clare,"[0, 0]","Have you ever been so hungry that even a bag of stale chips will do? ""Shiner"" is much like the perverse satisfaction one gets when biting into the first chip. It satisfies the hunger, and then you wonder what ever possessed you to eat it in the first place.Apart from the overtly bad acting and confusing direction (watch the interview with the director in the special features, you realise he is a first timer) the story is quite interesting within itself. There are two stories within one, with the sub plot being the most interesting.The first story is about a defeated, self-loathing boxer who is stalked by a rather drab and unsettling mentally unstable character. The second seeks to explore male sexuality, within a genre that is more than just ""gay"" stereotyping. Two 'straight' friends explore their sexual pathology by inflicting pain on each other, almost as if this makes the sexual ambiguity and experience they have with each other acceptable. After all one cannot be 'gay' if he is a man that likes fighting.The director explains in his interview that ""Shiner"" evolved around a short story. More specifically a unsuccessful boxer, who struggles to find his own sense of identity. Within that struggle are his own personal demons of depression and self-loathing, which seem perversely elevated with the realisation that he is being stalked. He cannot understand why another person would find him so interesting as to debase himself in such a way. He confronts the stalker initially in a manner which is both cruel and demeaning, but ends up entertaining the notion that perhaps there may be something good in this infatuation. One mental illness competing with another's mental illness, may make for some interesting psychology within a short story.Quite frankly in my opinion that part of the movie should have stayed a short story, as the sub plot was for me far more interesting. If it had been the central theme, with some stronger acting, this movie could have been a great deal better than the end result.Male masculinity and the demands of normative society, make for a strange, convoluted exploration of alternative sexuality. It specifically attempts to avoid the 'gay' label, making the friendship between two males something other than those labels with which we are accustomed. Gay, straight or bi-sexual are insufficient terms (read labels) to describe this sexual nuance, and as such it evolves into a reality of its own. The irony is that it is both destructive and pathological (as most pathologies are), but this does not diminish from the strange intimacy and satisfaction both character seem to get from the painful veneer they create for themselves.This aspect of the movie could have been exceptional if the director had taken some time to explore the subject a little more. It could and should have been a very different movie from ""Shiner"". With stronger direction and better characterization, the script would have evolved within itself. My own brief research into this subject has revealed a monolith of diverse sexuality. From sub cultures that explore CMNM (clothed males nude males) with no sexual contact amongst themselves, to male on male frotage (with penetration forbidden as a decent into homosexuality), and last but not least extreme masculinity amongst men as a means of acceptable sexual intimacy amongst themselves. The subject matter is profoundly interesting.Unfortunately stale chips remain stale chips. ""Shiner"" does a horrible job of exploring this dark subject matter. It merely plays in a genre, which itself demands greater direction and respect. This should not be the titillation it becomes, but rather a far more serious exploration of a evolving sexual practise.",3,Stale chips can be nice when hungry,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,3727,"['Have', 'ever', 'been', 'so', 'hungry', 'even', 'bag', 'stale', 'chips', 'will', 'do', 'Shiner', 'much', 'perverse', 'satisfaction', 'one', 'when', 'biting', 'first', 'chip', 'hunger', 'then', 'wonder', 'what', 'ever', 'possessed', 'eat', 'first', 'place.Apart', 'overtly', 'bad', 'acting', 'confusing', 'direction', 'watch', 'interview', 'director', 'special', 'features', 'realise', 'first', 'timer', 'story', 'quite', 'interesting', 'are', 'two', 'stories', 'one', 'sub', 'plot', 'being', 'most', 'interesting.The', 'first', 'story', 'defeated', 'self-loathing', 'boxer', 'who', 'stalked', 'rather', 'drab', 'unsettling', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'character', 'second', 'seeks', 'explore', 'male', 'sexuality', 'genre', 'more', 'just', 'gay', 'stereotyping', 'Two', ""'straight"", 'friends', 'explore', 'sexual', 'pathology', 'inflicting', 'pain', 'other', 'almost', 'sexual', 'ambiguity', 'experience', 'have', 'other', 'acceptable', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'be', ""'gay"", 'man', 'fighting.The', 'director', 'interview', 'Shiner', 'evolved', 'short', 'story', 'More', 'specifically', 'unsuccessful', 'boxer', 'who', 'find', 'own', 'sense', 'identity', 'struggle', 'are', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'depression', 'self-loathing', 'seem', 'perversely', 'elevated', 'realisation', 'being', 'stalked', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'person', 'would', 'find', 'so', 'interesting', 'debase', 'way', 'stalker', 'initially', 'manner', 'cruel', 'demeaning', 'up', 'entertaining', 'notion', 'perhaps', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'good', 'infatuation', 'One', 'mental', 'illness', 'competing', 'mental', 'illness', 'may', 'make', 'interesting', 'psychology', 'short', 'story.Quite', 'frankly', 'opinion', 'part', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'short', 'story', 'sub', 'plot', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', 'been', 'central', 'theme', 'stronger', 'acting', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'deal', 'better', 'end', 'result.Male', 'masculinity', 'demands', 'normative', 'society', 'make', 'strange', 'convoluted', 'exploration', 'alternative', 'sexuality', 'specifically', 'avoid', ""'gay"", 'label', 'making', 'friendship', 'two', 'males', 'something', 'other', 'labels', 'are', 'accustomed', 'Gay', 'straight', 'bi-sexual', 'are', 'insufficient', 'terms', 'read', 'labels', 'describe', 'sexual', 'nuance', 'such', 'reality', 'own', 'irony', 'destructive', 'pathological', 'most', 'pathologies', 'are', 'not', 'diminish', 'strange', 'intimacy', 'satisfaction', 'character', 'seem', 'get', 'painful', 'veneer', 'create', 'themselves.This', 'aspect', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'exceptional', 'director', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'explore', 'subject', 'little', 'more', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'different', 'movie', 'Shiner', 'stronger', 'direction', 'better', 'characterization', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'evolved', 'own', 'brief', 'research', 'subject', 'revealed', 'monolith', 'diverse', 'sexuality', 'sub', 'cultures', 'explore', 'CMNM', 'clothed', 'males', 'nude', 'males', 'sexual', 'contact', 'amongst', 'male', 'male', 'frotage', 'penetration', 'forbidden', 'decent', 'homosexuality', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'extreme', 'masculinity', 'amongst', 'men', 'means', 'acceptable', 'sexual', 'intimacy', 'subject', 'matter', 'profoundly', 'interesting.Unfortunately', 'stale', 'chips', 'remain', 'stale', 'chips', 'Shiner', 'horrible', 'job', 'exploring', 'dark', 'subject', 'matter', 'merely', 'genre', 'greater', 'direction', 'respect', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'titillation', 'rather', 'far', 'more', 'serious', 'exploration', 'evolving', 'sexual', 'practise']",Shiner
