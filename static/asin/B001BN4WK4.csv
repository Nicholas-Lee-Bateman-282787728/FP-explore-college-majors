I was wondering if maybe this show wasn't as entertaining as I remembered and waited a few weeks to watch the next episode.  After that, I was hooked all over again! This show has it all ... great location, costuming and of course, the Baracuda.  But the best thing about the show is the characters and their relationships with each other.  The show does not feel at all dated (except for the big cell phones!) and in fact, another favorite TV character of mine, Mark Harmon's Leroy Jethro Gibbs seems to have an awful lot in common with Nash.

After years of patience, waiting diligently for good news, any news, concerning 'Nash Bridges' release on DVD, we can all rest assured that we will have a copy of the first season come October 14th of this year!First of all, let me just say that 'Nash Bridges' is one of the best police drama series of all time, if not the greatest. What made it great was its ability to fuse action, drama, comedy and heartfelt emotion together into one cohesive package that brought a wonderful hour of entertainment each week to millions of fans. I'm sure most of us NB fans are still scratching our heads over why this show was cancelled after six wonderful seasons, because quite frankly there wasn't anything near as entertaining on TV at the time, nor has there been since, with a few exceptions. It was very unfortunate that we did not get a season finale, let a lone a series finale, as it stands the last episode was sudden and without warning, with many plot threads left unresolved which will be left up to our imagination, but there is a bright side to this magnificient series' untimely demise, which is that the wait until we can see it again from the beginning on our DVD players is just a few months away:) Here's to Nash and Joe, one of the best cop teams ever, long live 'Nash Bridges'!",5,Nash Bridges Here At Last!,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,1334,"['official', 'DVD', 'release', 'here', 'finally', 'years', 'patience', 'waiting', 'diligently', 'good', 'news', 'news', 'concerning', ""'Nash"", 'Bridges', 'release', 'DVD', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'will', 'have', 'copy', 'first', 'season', 'come', 'October', '14th', 'year', 'First', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Bridges', 'one', 'best', 'police', 'drama', 'series', 'time', 'not', 'greatest', 'What', 'made', 'great', 'was', 'ability', 'fuse', 'action', 'drama', 'comedy', 'heartfelt', 'emotion', 'together', 'one', 'cohesive', 'package', 'brought', 'wonderful', 'hour', 'entertainment', 'week', 'millions', 'fans', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'NB', 'fans', 'are', 'still', 'scratching', 'heads', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'six', 'wonderful', 'seasons', 'quite', 'frankly', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'entertaining', 'TV', 'time', 'there', 'been', 'few', 'exceptions', 'was', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'season', 'finale', 'let', 'lone', 'series', 'finale', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'sudden', 'warning', 'many', 'plot', 'threads', 'left', 'unresolved', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'up', 'imagination', 'bright', 'side', 'magnificient', 'series', 'untimely', 'demise', 'wait', 'can', 'see', 'again', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'players', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'away', 'Here', 'Nash', 'Joe', 'one', 'best', 'cop', 'teams', 'ever', 'long', 'live', ""'Nash"", 'Bridges']",Nash Bridges: Season 1

The rest of the cast works well and writing is top notch. You get to see a lot of S.F. in scenes. Audio and video is not sweetened or trashed as is done so often on the small screen. Syndication, however, is another animal. USA net cut it up bad enough, WGN went even further and hacked it to shreds. Yuck!Why we hate syndication in the first place. Naturally, the thought of enjoying the series in its original form was hopeful. Too bad that's not what we got. Some scenes were still edited from their original airing and choppy. The biggest disappointment was replacing all the music scores. It's blatantly obvious in the episode ""Vanishing Act"" where James Brown music was replaced with some kind of hip hop background poorly dubbed in. Scenes were re edited poorly and jumpy. You might as well watch the syndicated shows. They're free. It's subtly evident in the pilot episode where two Neal Hefti charts were replaced with some kind of weird pseudo jazz music. The scene was where Nash meets Kelly in the bar to discuss their final married moments. Dialog doesn't change but the weird background music is a let down. Totally changes the mood and scene establishment. Doesn't ruin the show but degrades it considerably. If you don't care about those things, you will like the DVD release. The music redux is annoying and the chopping certainly doesn't help. Just don't expect what you originally viewed. It's not there.",3,"Not uncut, music score different.
