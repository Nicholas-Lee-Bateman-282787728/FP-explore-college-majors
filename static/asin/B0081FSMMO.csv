1541030,A1NVO2OVXE09F4,B0081FSMMO,Caryss Wood-Behan,"[1, 1]","The Hatfields and McCoys plays out on screen impeccably, thanks to bulls-eye performances by the entire cast, most notably Kevin Costner, who assumes the role of the formidable ""Devil Anse,"" with an astonishing likeness.  Granted, Costner is one very versatile actor who defies typecasting. Yet...the thought of the boyishly handsome, even-featured, Kevin Costner playing the role of craggy, hook-nosed patriarch, Devil Anse Hatfield, seems  unimaginable and ill advised. But we are talking about Kevin Costner, of course, the same actor who appears equally at home on a baseball diamond, putting green. Indian settlement, and a world under water.  To say he mastered the part of Devil Anderson (""Anse"") Hatfield would be giving the actor short shrift. He became the man in every sense of the word -- gestures, locution, facial expressions.The mini-series captures the raw essence of frontier life in rural Appalachia but galvanizes the mundane with gunshots, grit and hair-trigger reactions. The imperative to defend what is theirs seems to reflect the survivor mentality of settlers in rural America. However, a continual call to arms represents the extreme extent to which these two clans will go in their efforts to defend their property and their families. The curious may search for an explanation as to what caused these people to settle their disputes differently from other Americans living during that era.Surprisingly, filming took place in the forests of Transylvania, Romania, at the Carpathian Mountain foothills, a setting which apparently simulates the untamed, rustic beauty of Appalachia quite effectively.Convincing performances by an extraordinary ensemble of actors pump energy, family pride and a firestorm of emotions into every second of this 3-part series.  Matt Barr plays Johnsie Hatfield, the charming, handsome suitor of Rosanna McCoy, played by Jennifer Pulsivar. The searing, hormonal fusion between these achingly beautiful lovers leads to a wrenching resolution.Lest the film's critics decry the movie's lack of humor, it should be noted that the story focuses primarily on the legendary feud, hardly reasons to make merry.  Additionally, frontier settlers designated special occasions for gaiety which often involved the entire townsfolk, as depicted at the beginning of the series and in a later scene, which actually shows Devil Anse and his wife dancing.Neither family submits to idle conversation; there is work to be done and money to be made, not to mention axes to grind.  Interestingly, the film's arresting moments need little in the way of verbal enhancement.  One scene of particular intensity involves Devil Anse's instantaneous, harsh reaction towards son, Johnsie, after learning of the young man's romantic involvement with Rosanna McCoy.  Devil Anse evidently possesses a short fuse but a long memory; even after Johnsie and Rosanna's romance has ended, he beholds Johnsie with a calculated, menacing demeanor, so much so that when he announces his intent to take the boy on a fishing outing his wife looks on with abject fear and foreboding. The question ringing through the silence seems to ask whether the Hatfield clan - and indeed, Devil Anse's own children - are exempt from his violent, often deadly, acts of vengeance.Hatfields and McCoys throws no stones, but makes no bones, either, about the priorities and truths those mountain people held dear, and the unconventional means by which they upheld them.",5,Mountain madness straight up....,1377820800,"08 30, 2013",2013,3463,"['Hatfields', 'McCoys', 'out', 'screen', 'impeccably', 'thanks', 'bulls-eye', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'who', 'role', 'formidable', 'Devil', 'Anse', 'astonishing', 'likeness', 'Granted', 'Costner', 'one', 'very', 'versatile', 'actor', 'who', 'typecasting', 'thought', 'boyishly', 'handsome', 'even-featured', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'playing', 'role', 'craggy', 'hook-nosed', 'patriarch', 'Devil', 'Anse', 'Hatfield', 'unimaginable', 'ill', 'advised', 'are', 'talking', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'course', 'same', 'actor', 'who', 'equally', 'home', 'baseball', 'diamond', 'putting', 'green', 'Indian', 'settlement', 'world', 'water', 'say', 'mastered', 'part', 'Devil', 'Anderson', 'Anse', 'Hatfield', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'actor', 'short', 'shrift', 'became', 'man', 'sense', 'word', 'gestures', 'locution', 'facial', 'expressions.The', 'mini-series', 'raw', 'essence', 'frontier', 'life', 'rural', 'Appalachia', 'mundane', 'gunshots', 'grit', 'hair-trigger', 'reactions', 'imperative', 'defend', 'what', 'theirs', 'reflect', 'survivor', 'mentality', 'settlers', 'rural', 'America', 'However', 'continual', 'call', 'arms', 'extreme', 'extent', 'two', 'clans', 'will', 'go', 'efforts', 'defend', 'property', 'families', 'curious', 'may', 'search', 'explanation', 'what', 'caused', 'people', 'settle', 'disputes', 'differently', 'other', 'Americans', 'living', 'era.Surprisingly', 'filming', 'took', 'place', 'forests', 'Transylvania', 'Romania', 'Carpathian', 'Mountain', 'foothills', 'setting', 'apparently', 'untamed', 'rustic', 'beauty', 'Appalachia', 'quite', 'effectively.Convincing', 'performances', 'extraordinary', 'ensemble', 'actors', 'pump', 'energy', 'family', 'pride', 'firestorm', 'emotions', 'second', '3-part', 'series', 'Matt', 'Barr', 'Johnsie', 'Hatfield', 'charming', 'handsome', 'suitor', 'Rosanna', 'McCoy', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Pulsivar', 'searing', 'hormonal', 'fusion', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'lovers', 'wrenching', 'resolution.Lest', 'film', 'critics', 'decry', 'movie', 'lack', 'humor', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'story', 'primarily', 'legendary', 'feud', 'hardly', 'reasons', 'make', 'merry', 'Additionally', 'frontier', 'settlers', 'designated', 'special', 'occasions', 'gaiety', 'often', 'involved', 'entire', 'townsfolk', 'depicted', 'beginning', 'series', 'later', 'scene', 'actually', 'Devil', 'Anse', 'wife', 'family', 'idle', 'conversation', 'work', 'be', 'done', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'not', 'mention', 'axes', 'grind', 'Interestingly', 'film', 'arresting', 'moments', 'need', 'little', 'way', 'verbal', 'enhancement', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'intensity', 'Devil', 'Anse', 'instantaneous', 'harsh', 'reaction', 'towards', 'son', 'Johnsie', 'learning', 'young', 'man', 'romantic', 'involvement', 'Rosanna', 'McCoy', 'Devil', 'Anse', 'evidently', 'short', 'fuse', 'long', 'memory', 'even', 'Johnsie', 'Rosanna', 'romance', 'ended', 'Johnsie', 'calculated', 'menacing', 'demeanor', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'intent', 'take', 'boy', 'fishing', 'outing', 'wife', 'abject', 'fear', 'foreboding', 'question', 'ringing', 'silence', 'ask', 'Hatfield', 'clan', 'indeed', 'Devil', 'Anse', 'own', 'children', 'are', 'exempt', 'violent', 'often', 'deadly', 'acts', 'vengeance.Hatfields', 'McCoys', 'stones', 'bones', 'either', 'priorities', 'truths', 'mountain', 'people', 'held', 'dear', 'unconventional', 'means', 'upheld']",Hatfields & McCoys

By necessity, of course, it's repetitively violent and full of shoot-'em-ups, hangings, and such, and is often rather depressing, with little humor or any other form of relief.

1541057,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B0081FSMMO,Dr. James Gardner,"[12, 20]","The History Channel has given us some memorable series (""Life After People"", ""How the States Got Their Shapes""), so I looked forward to their movement into mini-series in competition with PBS and Biography who have given us some really great mini series (e.g., Ken Burns' ""The Civil War"").The ""Hatfields and McCoys"" chronicles the feud between the two families, lasting from approximately 1865 to 1890, involving the murder of dozens of people, the use of state militias from two states, and even the intervention of the US Supreme Court.Despite the fame of the classic feud, it has only occasionally been covered in film (""Roseanna McCoy"", 1949) or TV (""The Hatfields and the McCoys, 1975).The current mini-series features some top notch actors (Kevin Costner, Bill Paxton, Tom Berenger, Powers Boothe, Mare Winningham), excellent production values, art and set direction. One gets the sense of the time and place, although the series does move through decades without any apparent changes in the principals and/or the locations.Kudos to Tom Berenger who gives a great performance as the psychopathic Hatfield uncle who sets the feud in motion.If the material is interesting, IMO it lacks engagement, partly because there is no one to root for. Each group consists of back stabbing, liquor swilling, bible thumping psychopaths and/or half wits, and the only character who seems to have some sense of proportion is Powers Boothe, who is on camera far too little. Even the ""romeo and juliette"" romance has such flawed characters it's hard to get behind anyone.Because the history (with a few minor exceptions) and the production values are so good, what we have here is a very good history lesson, which doesn't necessarily make for an excellent dramaBottom line - good history, but if you're looking for drama you'll have to look hard to find someone to root for.BTW - if stories about backwoods people is your interest, you might enjoy the TV series ""Justified"" or these films - ""Grapes of Wrath"" (1940), ""Tobacco Road"" (1941), ""Deliverance"" (1972), and ""Winter's Bone"" (2010).",4,Good history,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,2078,"['History', 'Channel', 'given', 'memorable', 'series', 'Life', 'People', 'How', 'States', 'Got', 'Their', 'Shapes', 'so', 'looked', 'forward', 'movement', 'mini-series', 'competition', 'PBS', 'Biography', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'really', 'great', 'mini', 'series', 'e.g.', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Civil', 'War', '.The', 'Hatfields', 'McCoys', 'feud', 'two', 'families', 'lasting', 'approximately', '1865', '1890', 'involving', 'murder', 'dozens', 'people', 'use', 'state', 'militias', 'two', 'states', 'even', 'intervention', 'US', 'Supreme', 'Court.Despite', 'fame', 'classic', 'feud', 'only', 'occasionally', 'been', 'covered', 'film', 'Roseanna', 'McCoy', '1949', 'TV', 'Hatfields', 'McCoys', '1975', '.The', 'current', 'mini-series', 'top', 'notch', 'actors', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'excellent', 'production', 'values', 'art', 'set', 'direction', 'One', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'series', 'move', 'decades', 'apparent', 'changes', 'principals', 'and/or', 'locations.Kudos', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'who', 'great', 'performance', 'psychopathic', 'Hatfield', 'uncle', 'who', 'feud', 'motion.If', 'material', 'interesting', 'IMO', 'engagement', 'partly', 'one', 'root', 'group', 'back', 'stabbing', 'liquor', 'swilling', 'bible', 'thumping', 'psychopaths', 'half', 'wits', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'have', 'sense', 'proportion', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'who', 'camera', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'Even', 'romeo', 'juliette', 'romance', 'such', 'flawed', 'characters', 'hard', 'get', 'history', 'few', 'minor', 'exceptions', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'history', 'lesson', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'excellent', 'dramaBottom', 'line', 'good', 'history', ""'re"", 'looking', 'drama', ""'ll"", 'have', 'look', 'hard', 'find', 'someone', 'root', 'for.BTW', 'stories', 'backwoods', 'people', 'interest', 'might', 'enjoy', 'TV', 'series', 'Justified', 'films', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', '1940', 'Tobacco', 'Road', '1941', 'Deliverance', '1972', 'Winter', 'Bone', '2010']",Hatfields & McCoys

Simply put even though the love triangle dragged down certain portions of the action the series is strongest when it focuses on the true reasons for the feud which were economic in nature.  Costner can certainly be melodramatic and self-congratulatory but he has managed to capture an element of the Southern character without ever really meaning to.  In the old days when one was poor and hardly had enough to feed ones family we still had honor.  Now we look on that rather outmoded concept and say yeah h-o-n-o-r what is the market price on that exactly?  Either way the miniseries demonstrates how that one curse or virtue forced events along a path of increasing violence until the reasons for the feud who started it and who is ultimately in the right are irrelevant.  In the end which family was the most wronged is left open to the interpretation of the viewer both families used the law courts in the states of Kentucky and West Virginia toward their own ends, both fought through honest and crooked means to control their own economic destinies and both families had men of honor and men of blood.Now most of the cast did a really good job Tom Berenger plays one of those men of blood Jack Vance shown to not like McCoys all that much but can be almost called kind where Hatfields are concerned.  He would be the worst person in the series if not for the inclusion of 'Bad' Frank Phillips who might win the award for maddest maddog in the history of the universe.  Not to be overlooked are the ""tools"" used by both factions the judge a Hatfield and Perry Cline who is in the running with Bad Frank.  I will say that because the main events of the story are so expansive some characters have a tendency to fade into the background like any of the McCoy children even though Randell and Nancy McCoy are played very well.  Contrast the treatment of the McCoy family with three of the Hatfield characters Cotton Top, Cap and Jonsey who all had parts to play in the overall.  Costner is the reason this thing got made but as much as I can respect him for that he just plays the same character he played in Open Range and Dances with Wolves I think I even saw a little bit of Field of Dreams in there.Overall-Some flaws but with most of the cast giving a really great effort a few hiccups can be forgiven.

West Virginia was not far behind.This is the story of the best-known feuds in our history.  The Hatfields of West Virginia fought the McCoys of Kentucky for years.Life required hard work that produced not much more than needed to survive.  Law was largely absent and when present tended to create as many problems as it settled.The result is people who do not shrink from violence and are strong enough to carry them point.While almost five hours long, you will not be bored.  The first part covers the origins of the feud.  Social slights lead to words.Words lead to fists leading to knives and ending with guns.  The feud did not spring into being and we follow the descent into war one logical step at a time.Part 2 covers the major fighting.

Costner and Paxton as the titular leads are brilliant. Complex, multi-faceted characters whom you both admire and despair of simultaneously. Truly excellent in almost every department, beautifully filmed locales capture the guts and the glory of the Appalachians, both stunning and brutal.

That said, the sense of family, the tribal aspect, and the individuals involved are appealing (in the whole) and never painted in one dimension.

1541090,A3GN5X5BEMG0QK,B0081FSMMO,Jedd,"[1, 3]","Although I am not biologically related to either the Hatfields or the McCoys, I have known people who are.  As a child, I heard stories of the feud from descendents of the McCoys who lived far away from Kentucky.  They were afraid to speak openly about it because they thought maybe some of the Hatfields had moved out where they were living.  But because I was just a kid, they didn't worry too much about what they said in front of me.I remember their fear, and what I recall them saying was that one of the Hatfields had tried to marry a McCoy girl and that neither family would have it.  But from what I heard, she didn't sound like a nice person, not like the very sympathetic Roseanna McCoy in the movie.  I heard that she and he went swimming and that during that seemingly harmless activity, she did something to him, something that McCoy women were known for.  She hit him in the head and almost killed him.  In his dazed state, she fed him lies, and they became a couple.  In the South when someone is hit in the head very hard or almost drowned to death or choked almost to death, he can from then on be seen as ""changed.""  It's not that he was born with mental retardation, mental illness, or some other mental ailment; he was violently attacked with the sole purpose of rendering him brain damaged.  This is, according to what I heard as a youngster, what happened to one of the Hatfield sons at the hands of one of the McCoy daughters.  Later, the same son married another McCoy girl, but just as in the movie, she was a bad character.  This violent ""changing"" of someone at the hands of a McCoy stands in contrast to how the Hatfields treat people.  In the movie, the boy Cotton, who is developmentally disabled, was not ""changed""; he was born different, and this is pointed out for good reason.  The filmmaker did not want any of his viewers to think that the Hatfields had mistreated the boy, making him different.Another thing I heard as a child is that the McCoys didn't just shoot people like crazy and hit them in terrible fights, but they also poisoned people.  This was lightly touched upon in the movie when Johnse was captured by Roseanna's brothers, and one of them suggested that they make him drink poison.  However, as I was watching the part when Johnse and Roseanna's baby dies and then when Roseanna dies, it occured to me that perhaps both of them had been poisoned by her family, the McCoys.  The McCoy descendents that I knew were not gentle people; both the men and the women were subject to violent fits of rage.  The women didn't usually raise their voices; they could almost whisper a threat.  Furthermore, they all behaved as one huge criminal family that reminded me of organized crime families associated with the Mafia.  But they were not Italian, nor were they very religious.  Some of them went to church, but it was only for show.As an adult, I have met many people related to the Hatfields, and many of them are in the U.S. military.  Generally speaking, I have found them to be trustworthy, hard working people who despise trickery of any kind.  They have said that many of the McCoys have gone into law enforcement (the movie reflects this at the very end), where their presence has become detrimental to decent society.  They cautioned that in places like Kentucky and Tennessee, it can be risky to call 911 because the police officer who shows up might be a McCoy.  In the movie, some of the worst criminals wear a badge.Just as the McCoys have many different last names now, so do the Hatfields.  You can't tell much of anything by the last name, but you can identify a real McCoy by his or her behavior.  Some of this is touched upon in the movie, and I found that fascinating.  The character Uncle Jim, a Hatfield, has a dog he loves, and he fits the dog with a colorful, decorative collar to show that his dog is beloved, not some uncared for stray.  This is significant.  He's a hunter, and dogs are often beloved by their owners who rely on them when they hunt.  The McCoys to this day have the reputation of being dog killers.  Sometimes the dog is brutally killed, and other times the dog is poisoned to death, either in stages or all at once.  So early in the movie when a McCoy insults a Hatfield in a bar by saying that the Hatfield fornicates with a dog, that part rings true based on what I have heard from those related to the Hatfields.  Also, I have known people related to the McCoys who kill the dogs of those they dislike or disapprove of.  The unspoken threat is ""First, I kill your dog, and then I kill you.""  There is even a scene in the movie in which Johnse kicks his uncle's dog because he's angry about the treatment of his wife's family.  It's like he's becoming a McCoy.  It's all very subtle in the movie, but it's there.  Later, the Hatfield patriarch contemplates killing his own son Johnse when they're out fishing.  He doesn't go through with it, but his extreme anger is over his son becoming too much like a McCoy.  Of course, his son has married Nancy McCoy, who is influencing him.Also, as a child, I heard about the whipping of a McCoy girl by a Hatfield man.  A lot was made of that by the female descendents of the McCoys, and a lot was made of the kind of whip that was used--a ""cat.""  I think that they were afraid that a Hatfield man would come after them and whip them.  I'm still not completely sure about what that all means or why the whipping scene is an important part of the story, but I am glad to see that it made it into the movie.In the movie, I found the love story between Roseanna and Johnse to be particularly heart-breaking, and even if it's not completely historically accurate, the whole idea of their story fits with the reasons for the feud.  From what I could gather from the people I knew who were related to the McCoys, it was not unheard of for a McCoy to steal a boyfriend or a husband.  She would approach her victim as a ""friend,"" often with accomplices.  Then she or one of her accomplices would whack him in the head with a hard object, and then the McCoy woman would pretend to be right there to help him and offer him a pillow or some sort of comfort.  In his vulnerable state, he would take her up on her offer of help, and she would continue to play him to get him where she wanted.  This is the sort of thing that Nancy McCoy did to Johnse and her cousin Roseanna.  It's the icy coldness of it that is so disturbing.  In the movie, Nancy finally admits that she never loved Johnse and that she took him from Roseanna purely out of revenge.  It was all part of her plot and her hatred for Hatfields.  She didn't care that Johnse and Roseanna loved each other.  Love meant nothing to her.Another thing that I noted was that even though Mare Winningham did a great acting job as Mrs. McCoy, what I had heard about Mrs. McCoy as a child didn't quite go with how she was characterized in the movie.  In the movie, she's sympathetic.  But I heard that she was not so nice.  Her husband, the McCoy patriarch was nice, but she ""changed"" him and then told everyone that the war was to blame for his declining mental state.  Also, in the movie, when he comes back from prison and she hardly recognizes him, her statement that she almost forgot she was married has a double meaning.  That statement to the McCoy descendents I knew was almost a joke.  It meant that she wasn't faithful.  But in the movie, her statement isn't spoken in that way, almost as if it was lifted from some historical document and stuck in the movie despite a lack of understanding of the implication.  Toward the end of the movie, when she leaves to go stay in a mental hospital, she still seems sympathetic and docile, but the female McCoy descendents I heard talking stated that her husband had her committed to keep her out of prison and away from him and other potential victims.Whether you're descended from Hatfields or McCoys or not, this movie is a reminder that tricksters, swindlers, murderers, and drunks are all threats.  They seldom act alone. Like almost everybody else, they reproduce and grow in numbers.  There are Hatfields and McCoys among us now and not just in Kentucky and West Virginia either.I would give this movie only four stars, not five, simply because it did not address some of the accusations against the McCoys, particularly the McCoy women, that I had heard.  It's all hearsay, of course, not anything I've read.  The movie portrayed the McCoy women as victims more than anything else.  But from what I have heard, they were dog killers, husband and boyfriend stealers, head bashers, and poisoners.  The Hatfields, on the other hand, were absolutely not going to stand for any double dealing nor any trickery.  The Hatfields were armed and dangerous, and they forbade their men from associating with McCoy women for good reason.  Both families were violent, but there were big differences between them.  The Hatfields may have been ruthless killers, but they didn't pray to God one minute and then commit murder the next as the McCoys did.",4,Akin to The Godfather Trilogy,1344729600,"08 12,

1541108,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0081FSMMO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","The History Channel has been trying to stretch its wings in recent years and adapt into a more competitive TV marketplace (that's why some of their reality programs seem less and less connected to actual history). Last year, they commissioned their first dramatic mini-series, ""The Kennedys,"" which they then decided not to air due to outside pressures. REELZ picked up ""The Kennedys,"" it became a hit for them, and it won multiple EMMYs at last year's ceremony. Well, I guess the ancestors of the Hatfields and the McCoys don't have as much political clout as the remaining Kennedy clan, because no complaints stopped the ambitious three part ""Hatfields and McCoys"" from airing. Proving that there is still life for the mini-series format outside of premium cable, ""Hatfields and McCoys"" was an instant success and a ratings blockbuster. With 13.9 viewers (for the initial broadcast), the show became the number one rated non-sporting event in basic cable history. Pretty good news for the network! Pretty good news for the viewers as well, it almost ensures we'll see History continue to dabble in dramatic programming.Before I discuss the actual program, it doesn't seem as if anything has been said about the actual DVD release. Both the DVD and Blu-ray will contain two discs with a run time of approximately 290 minutes. Both versions are presented in widescreen video, with English 5.1 audio and English subtitles. Here's what else is included, there's not much in the way of extras:""The Making of Hatfields & McCoys"" Featurette""I Know These Hills"" music video featuring Kevin Costner and Modern WestMany have already contributed facts about the actual mini-series, so I'll be brief. This is a solidly constructed and well acted project. Kevin Costner does a good job as the stoic Hatfield patriarch and Bill Paxton has a showier bit as the head of the McCoy clan. As the program begins, there are so many peripheral characters that it might take a bit to align everyone into their proper relationships. Once that is done, however, I think each part of the mini-series gets progressively more involving. The Hatfields make out slightly better in terms of representation. Tom Berenger, as Hatfield uncle Jim Vance, is really the catalyst that begins the feud. Almost every bad act from their side of the quarrel stems from Vance, the other family members are more level headed or tend to react justifiably. The McCoys don't fare quite as well, with various supporting characters perpetuating injustices.There are quite a few good performances throughout. Matt Barr and Lindsay Pulsipher own a lot of Part One as star crossed lovers and both are likable and believable. In addition to Berenger, other great character actors like Powers Boothe and Mare Winningham make an impact. Jena Malone and Andrew Howard bring a lot of vitality as villains in the final installment. But the cast is really immense, you could arguably highlight any number of other actors. I don't think, in the end, that ""Hatfields and McCoys"" is groundbreaking or revolutionary. But it is solid storytelling and fitfully entertaining. I suspect the History Channel will find itself attending this year's primetime EMMY awards. Let the Hatfields and McCoys battle it out for acting honors, that would be a nice irony.

With a total running time of 6 hours, it will trim down to about 4  without commercials and the traditional opening recap.  Even with that option, the length is the biggest drawback to the movie.  As you could expect, the film repeats the theme over and over.Drawn from a real feud dating to the Civil War, the Hatfields headed by `Devil' Anse (Kevin Costner) and the McCoys, headed by Randall (Bill Paxton) were friendly neighbors at one time.  A series of minor snubs and taunts by younger members of the clans erupts when one of the Hatfields (includes various cousins with different surnames) is accused of stealing a pig belonging to Randall.  One thing leads to another and a 2 generation war begins between the two families who live on opposite sides of the Kentucky-West Virginia border.The conflict also involves Romeo and Juliet romantic entanglements between the two families, highlighted by the son of Anse (Matt Barr) impregnating the daughter of Randall (Lindsay Pulsipher).  The performances are strong with Kevin Costner in the lead as Anse, an unrecognizable Tom Berenger as his uncle Jim Vance, Powers Booth as older brother and judge ""Wall,""Andrew Howard as bounty hunter `Bad' Frank Phillips, Mare Winningham as Randall's wife and Jena Malone as troublemaking Nancy McCoy, niece of Randall.Primarily shot in Romania, the hilly, timber rich outdoor scenes are truly realistic and have a you-are-there feel.

1541163,A30I207MIU383O,B0081FSMMO,"Phillip E. Hardy ""Phillip E. Hardy""","[434, 524]","The History Channel miniseries ""Hatfields and McCoys"", directed by Kevin Reynolds and written by Ted Mann and Bill Kerby enjoyed brisk ratings this week. Thus far, this rendering of the epic struggle between two families living in West Virginia and Kentucky is the best one to date. That is not to say that it did not have many flaws. In general, I admired Ted Mann's work on the HBO series ""Deadwood"", where he created great dialogue for both fictional and real denizens of the South Dakota boom town. The characters in this miniseries also generally speak with a high level of intelligence with only a few hillbilly archetypes thrown in. The acting for this program is outstanding with a few exceptions. Most notably, Jena Malone gets my vote for the worst overacting in the part of Nancy McCoy. However, Powers Boothe, Kevin Costner, Mare Winningham and Bill Paxton all turn in solid performances. For his portrayal of ""Uncle Jim"" Vance, Tom Berenger is the standout in this cast. As with most Hollywood versions of significant historical events, the writers and filmmakers feel a need to change the truth to suit their plot development. This includes the requisite romantic elements and composite characters. With that latitude in mind, I still found the historical inaccuracies of this television movie to be staggering. Having performed extensive research on the real feud, I would like to point out a number of these for the perspective DVD buyer:1) The show made a big point about Devil Anse taking unofficial leave from his Rebel Company D during the Civil War. Randolph McCoy also went on unofficial leave soon afterward. So there was no moral high ground there; nor do I know of any historical record stating this caused any ill will between the two men.2) The show depicted major religious differences between Randolph and Devil Anse. I have never read anything stating religion played a strong part in the feud. However, economic jealousy did.3) The hog trial was conducted in Deacon Anse's cabin in Raccoon Hollow; and not a regular court house in Mate County convened by Wall Hatfield.4) Perry Cline was not counsel for the plaintiff during the hog trial.5) Asa Harmon McCoy was not shot while hiding at a still. Ironically, this Union man owned a slave named Pete. Unfortunately, for Asa, Pete was followed to a cave by Logan County Regulars.6) Bill Staton was not ambushed by Paris and Sam McCoy. In fact, it was the opposite, as Staton layed in wait for the McCoys. Sam was never convicted and was acquitted for murder on the grounds of self defense.7) Randolph McCoy did not send his sons to retrieve Roseanna McCoy from the Hatfield cabin. He sent his three daughters. Therefore, Johnse Hatfield was never shot by the McCoy brothers.8) Frank Phillips did not kill Tom Wallace. Larkin and Jacob McCoy probably did.9) Wall Hatfield did not surrender himself to Pikeville authorities and was captured by Frank Phillips. Additionally, he was not the sympathetic character portrayed by Powers Boothe. He was an overpowering manipulator who had a strong lead role in the murders of Tolbert, Pharmer and Randolph McCoy Junior.10) Devil Anse and Wall Hatfield did not call for Sarah McCoy to come visit her sons before they were executed. She demanded to see her boys. Wall and Devil Anse blocked her entrance to the schoolhouse where her captive sons were being held. For nearly an hour, in the pouring rain, Sarah pressed the Hatfield brothers before they relented to a visit.11) Perry Cline had a wife; and I have never read that he showed romantic interest in Roseanna McCoy.12) Cap Hatfield wrote the famous letter to the newspapers asking for an abatement of hostilities, not Devil Anse. Though it looked very touching to show Devil Anse reading the letter to the clan.My other criticism of this show, is though it has been described by critics as ""atmospheric"", I found it to be humorless and relentlessly grim. I know the producers had six hours to tell the story, but I believed there were many missed opportunities to show less violence and greater depth of character. Instead, most of the primary players were dislikable. The real Devil Anse was a remarkable man of extraordinary humor. There was great wrong done on both sides during this clan warfare; but these actions were carried out by complex people of both good and bad temperament. Finally, the fact that little was depicted about the tremendous court battles between Kentucky and West Virginia was I believe, another opportunity that was missed.",4,History Channel's Hatfields And

1541175,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,B0081FSMMO,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[4, 8]","Like most interested people I've heard accounts--legends, really--of the Hatfield-McCoy conflict many times over the years.  Yes, all the elements are here in this film--the Civil War, timber deal gone wrong, the pig, the Hatfield-McCoy romance and, of course, the feud and killings.  Probably the main difference between the legendary account that I heard and this film has to do with the initial events during the Civil War.  I'd heard that Devil Hatfield was a Confederate soldier who returned from war boasting that he'd killed one of the Yankee McCoys on the field of battle--and that this boasting was the initial spark that set off the feud.The film, of course, shows Anse Hatfield and Randall McCoy in the same Confederate Army company with the first hint of trouble was Hatfield's desertion.  Apparently, however, the depiction of the murder of the returned Yankee soldier--and Randall McCoy uncle--by Confederate Home Guards is correct although other sources say that this event didn't lead to Hatfield-McCoy trouble simply because many Confederate-sympathizing McCoys reckoned that the Yankee Uncle was a turncoat that deserved to be executed.I applaud the film in that it that it so closely approaches the actual Appalacian people and attitudes of the time.  The accents, clothing, weapons, and even the look of the women just feel right.  The woman who plays Randal McCoy's wife does an especially wonderful job.  Costner, who I never respected as an actor, does a masterful job in his depiction of the grim and relentless 'Devil' Anse hatfield.  Sometimes it is a little difficult to keep the characters separated precisely because the various antagonists were such similar people.  I also question whether the Hatfield boys spent quite so much time hanging around in the local house of ill repute although both families engaged in whiskey-making and drinking.  I also suspect that the number of actual killings was--as bad as it was during the actual feud--amplified for dramatic effect.  In the long run, Hollywood always interferes with history.At the same time, I think the film does an especially good job of depicting a very basic aspect of the tale.  The Hatfields and McCoys, like most of the folks living in the central and southern Appalacian mountains, shared the same Scots-Irish ancestry.  The Hatfield and McCoy feud had all of the aspects of an ancient highland Scottish clan feud.  Despite Hollywood depictions of Highland fighters going into battle in plaid kilts with skirling bagpipes, these Highland feuds were between poor people in straightened circumstances.  Just like their successors, the Hatfields and McCoys, bootleg whiskey and drunkeness was part of Scottish culture.  The Hatfield and McCoy conflict was a Scottish blood feud brought to American shores.",5,Body Count,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,2798,"['most', 'interested', 'people', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'accounts', 'really', 'Hatfield-McCoy', 'conflict', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'Yes', 'elements', 'are', 'here', 'film', 'Civil', 'War', 'timber', 'deal', 'gone', 'wrong', 'pig', 'Hatfield-McCoy', 'romance', 'course', 'feud', 'killings', 'Probably', 'main', 'difference', 'legendary', 'account', 'heard', 'film', 'do', 'initial', 'events', 'Civil', 'War', ""'d"", 'heard', 'Devil', 'Hatfield', 'was', 'Confederate', 'soldier', 'who', 'returned', 'war', 'boasting', ""'d"", 'killed', 'one', 'Yankee', 'McCoys', 'field', 'battle', 'boasting', 'was', 'initial', 'spark', 'set', 'off', 'feud.The', 'film', 'course', 'Anse', 'Hatfield', 'Randall', 'McCoy', 'same', 'Confederate', 'Army', 'company', 'first', 'hint', 'trouble', 'was', 'Hatfield', 'desertion', 'Apparently', 'however', 'depiction', 'murder', 'returned', 'Yankee', 'soldier', 'Randall', 'McCoy', 'uncle', 'Confederate', 'Home', 'Guards', 'correct', 'other', 'sources', 'say', 'event', 'did', ""n't"", 'lead', 'Hatfield-McCoy', 'trouble', 'simply', 'many', 'Confederate-sympathizing', 'McCoys', 'reckoned', 'Yankee', 'Uncle', 'was', 'turncoat', 'deserved', 'be', 'executed.I', 'film', 'so', 'closely', 'actual', 'Appalacian', 'people', 'attitudes', 'time', 'accents', 'clothing', 'weapons', 'even', 'look', 'women', 'just', 'feel', 'right', 'woman', 'who', 'Randal', 'McCoy', 'wife', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Costner', 'who', 'never', 'respected', 'actor', 'masterful', 'job', 'depiction', 'grim', 'relentless', ""'Devil"", 'Anse', 'hatfield', 'Sometimes', 'little', 'difficult', 'keep', 'characters', 'separated', 'precisely', 'various', 'antagonists', 'were', 'such', 'similar', 'people', 'also', 'question', 'Hatfield', 'boys', 'spent', 'quite', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'hanging', 'around', 'local', 'house', 'ill', 'repute', 'families', 'engaged', 'whiskey-making', 'drinking', 'also', 'suspect', 'number', 'actual', 'killings', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'was', 'actual', 'feud', 'amplified', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'long', 'run', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'same', 'time', 'think', 'film', 'especially', 'good', 'job', 'depicting', 'very', 'basic', 'aspect', 'tale', 'Hatfields', 'McCoys', 'most', 'folks', 'living', 'central', 'southern', 'Appalacian', 'mountains', 'shared', 'same', 'Scots-Irish', 'ancestry', 'Hatfield', 'McCoy', 'feud', 'had', 'aspects', 'ancient', 'highland', 'Scottish', 'clan', 'feud', 'Hollywood', 'depictions', 'Highland', 'fighters', 'going', 'battle', 'plaid', 'kilts', 'skirling', 'bagpipes', 'Highland', 'feuds', 'were', 'poor', 'people', 'straightened', 'circumstances', 'Just', 'successors', 'Hatfields', 'McCoys', 'bootleg', 'whiskey', 'drunkeness', 'was', 'part', 'Scottish', 'culture', 'Hatfield', 'McCoy', 'conflict', 'was', 'Scottish', 'blood', 'feud', 'brought', 'American', 'shores']",Hatfields & McCoys

Starting at the end of the Civil War, and bringing the states of Kentucky and West Virginia close to a war of its own, the events of that bloody conflict have left their mark on American history. Now, the History Channel ventures into scripted drama for the first time with the miniseries ""Hatfields & McCoys,"" an intense, character-driven film that looks at the price of feuding.What really drives this four-hour plus film are the outstanding performances by the cast, which works from a powerfully-penned script. Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton do brilliant work. You do not really ""like"" either character in the traditional sense of the word, but you definitely find them fascinating, and cannot help but enjoy the powerful work these two do. The supporting cast is fantastic as well, really finding the human drive behind these real-life characters.The filmmakers have also done a brilliant job of bringing 19th Century Appalachia to life, through the beautiful cinematography, set design, and even the music of the period.

The show was a ratings winner, primarily because it has a script and production values more common in a feature-length, big-screen motion picture. Directed by Kevin Reynolds, it stars Kevin Costner as ""Devil"" Anse Hatfield and Bill Paxton as Randall McCoy, the patriarchs of the warring clans.The escalating story of the feud is covered nicely, beginning with disputed logging rights and moving on to the theft of a pig, a series of minor slights and taunts by younger members of the clans, legal judgments deemed one-sided (the local judge was himself a Hatfield), and Hatfield's desertion from the Confederate army during the Civil War.Spread over four and a half hours, the series explores the feud and its ramifications in detail and satisfyingly characterizes the many individuals who played a significant role.  Director Reynolds does a first-rate job of bringing the era to life and showing how a romantic involvement between members of the two clans gave the feud a Romeo-and-Juliet air.Costner and Paxton are both strong as the leaders and show how the ongoing hostility takes a toll on their health and marriages.  After twenty years of hatred, distrust, and revenge, both men have become weary and long to end the feud with honor intact.Standouts in the supporting cast are Powers Booth as Judge Valentine Hatfield, Boyd Holbrook as William ""Cap"" Hatfield, Mare Winningham as Sally McCoy, and Tom Berenger as Jim Vance, Devil Anse's uncle.""Hatfields & McCoys"" shows that, with the right project, audiences will flock to a mini-series, a genre once extremely popular on network TV and now pretty much the province of cable stations.

Little by little the families lives cross paths and tension continue to mount. When one of McCoys's sons is attacked by a member of the Hatfield family a war is begun. I have stated before that the last really good western to me was ""Open Range"" since then the genre has had a rough 10 years. Leave it to Costner to bring it back. Even though this is a made-for-TV series don't let that scare you off. The movie is a must see for western fans and history buffs. I really don't know anything about the actual history of the feud but this movie made me want to learn more. Costner is perfect in this role as the leader of the Hatfield clan. Paxton is good, but a strange choice in the role of the McCoy's head. I could really go on and on about this movie but I will just say that this could be the movie that returns the western genre to the way it should be.

1541210,A3BOH0F7V12H7O,B0081FSMMO,William Kendall,"[5, 6]","Hatfields & McCoys is the recent miniseries, headlined by Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton as the patriarchs of the two clans, telling the story of the vendetta from the end of the Civil War to its conclusion in 1891. The two start out as young men, and we follow them through to old age in the series, along with their families and the various people who played a part in the events of the vendetta.Devil Anse Hatfield (Costner) and Randolph McCoy (Paxton) are both soldiers in the Confederate army until Hatfield abandons the field to go home to the borderlands of Kentucky and West Virginia, to his wife Levicy (Sarah Parish). McCoy comes home to his wife Sarah ""Sally"" McCoy (Mare Winningham) at war's end to a world changed, where his brother Harmon has been killed by Jim Vance (Tom Berenger), an uncle to Devil Anse. This is what most consider to be the beginning of the feud, an act of anger over Harmon McCoy having had served as a Union Soldier.The years go on. While the Hatfields seem to prosper with timbering in the area, Randall McCoy and his relations fall behind, and the unresolved death of one of their own festers in the McCoys. The theft of a pig and subsequent trial of a Hatfield more than a decade later creates more tensions between the families. The relationship of two of the children, Johnse Hatfield (Matt Barr) and Roseanna McCoy (Lindsay Pulsipher) makes things worse. Where Randall tries to use the law to air his grievances, Devil Anse is more likely to take the law into his own hands. On both sides, the tensions deepen, fighting breaks out, lives are broken, and people are killed as revenge becomes absolute. By the end of the feud, two families have been hit hard, the story has made national headlines, and two hardened enemies find themselves at a crossroads.The miniseries does justice to the story, particularly with respect to what I've later read about the feud. It tries to be historically accurate, much more so than previous film or television versions of the story, which veered wildly off the rail. There are a few glitches- the historical record, for instance, is uncertain as to if Randall McCoy even fought in the Confederate Army, Costner and Paxton are roughly around the same age and in reality, Randall was older than Devil Anse, Roseanna McCoy was a blonde- but these are relatively minor. The filmmakers wanted to keep as close to the original narrative of history where possible, and the production values really pay attention to the finer details, in costuming, music, sets. While the filming itself was done in eastern Europe, the setting in the film ends up feeling very much like a place in the backwoods of America, like the Kentucky and West Virginia borderland must have been like.The pacing of the story works well. It slowly builds up the tensions, conveying the events as they go along, bringing the feud to a boil, to the point where it finally explodes. We, the audience, can believe the animosity that we've seen growing in these characters. The casting, for the most part, works well. The exception would have to be Matt Barr and Lindsay Pulsipher, neither of whom have much in the way of gravitas for the parts. There are some who look at the story of these two as a Romeo and Juliet sort of story; I didn't sense that. To begin, there were already a number of Hatfields and McCoys marrying. And it felt more like Johnse Hatfield was an irresponsible, womanizing drunkard who threw away what might have been a good thing just by being himself. Barr doesn't bring much weight to the role, and seems more like he's channeling Ryan Gosling (a bad thing, since in my opinion, Gosling sleepwalks his way through every role he takes). Pulsipher as Roseanna is more or less the tragic character, doomed to a bad end, but she just doesn't feel like we should take her seriously.Okay, that's the bad casting choices out of the way. Now the good, and there are a number of standout performances. Boyd Holbrook plays Cap Hatfield, another of Devil Anse's sons, and he gives the part a vindictive, ruthless streak, much like the original man might well have possessed. Jim Vance is the sort of sadistic, vicious pitbull that history seems to suggest he is, and Berenger perfectly plays those qualities. Powers Boothe, playing ""Wall"" Hatfield, an elder brother, gives the role a certain dignity and strength throughout. He's the voice of reason, reluctant to get involved in the feud, though the feud leads him to a bad end anyway. Andrew Howard plays a man named Bad Frank Phillips, a gun for hire brought in by the McCoys to go after the Hatfields, and though he's older than the actual man himself was, he plays the role with a vicious rattlesnake sort of quality, a thoroughly dangerous man.There are several women in the cast who stand out. Jena Malone, who's been acting since childhood, plays a McCoy cousin, Nancy, who gets involved with Johnse after the breakdown of the relationship with her cousin. She brings a conniving, manipulative quality to the role, effectively playing both sides against each other, though her loyalties remain to her family. Sarah Parish as Devil Anse's wife Levicy is a voice of reason, drowned out by violence, watching her family tear itself apart for the sake of retribution. And Mare Winningham plays Sarah McCoy, one of the more tragic characters of the story, who loses most of her family, and ends up broken emotionally and physically. She too watches her family implode from within, her husband becoming increasingly bitter, and the performance is haunting.It's the two leads in the cast that make it come together. They carry the weight of the series, and they do not disappoint. Bill Paxton is one of those actors who just gets better with age. He plays McCoy's gradual decline from a reasonable man into bitter anger, finally into a state where he's shattered by all that has happened to him. Randall McCoy spent the rest of his life in complaint, never really getting over the feud, the anger still festering in him, and Paxton perfectly conveys that. He's a man whose eyes are very expressive, and two emotions that come across that way throughout are pain and the notion of being haunted. He moves from being a man who believes in God and the law to becoming a man who has lost all that matters to him in the end, leaving him unhinged, deeply bitter, and cynical. Not unlike the real McCoy, who by all accounts came apart after the feud.Costner too is an actor who, given the right role, really can shine. He plays mean and cruel very well, and Devil Anse certainly qualifies. There's a ruthless, calculating streak to the character, a stubborn quality that's not willing to let go of an argument. He also feels plausible as the leader of a large extended family, though the man himself was not the eldest in the clan; Costner carries enough dramatic weight that the audience can believe people around him would follow him. I was reminded of my favourite Costner film Wyatt Earp, where he plays the lawman as the driving force of a family, similarly moved to wage a personal war against people he deems the enemy. In Wyatt and in Devil Anse, there's something of the same mean streak. There's a darkness that particularly comes out at times in this series, to the point where he's willing to take extreme action against a member of his own family he thinks may have betrayed him.There's a moment, late in the series, when the two come face to face again. It's a confrontation that's not quite what it seems. Costner and Paxton spar with each other in that scene, which really comes across as a crossroads. It also brings into question the issue of mental stability, but it perfectly conveys just how deeply the loathing had cut into both men. It might well be the pivotal moment of the entire series.The series leaves us with questions. Are there any of these people we should feel sympathetic about? Yes. The women are, for the most part, more sympathetic than the men, which I think transfers as well over to the real story. They watched as their families destroyed themselves, as their men went to war with each other, as stubbornness and hatred dominated their actions. And they paid dearly for it. The series sheds light on this chapter in American history, reminding us of just how badly anger can dominate, can get out of control, and how hard the consequences of that can be. And in the end, it's compelling and entertaining... and dark.",5,"Blood, Family, And Revenge",1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,8455,"['Hatfields', 'McCoys', 'recent', 'miniseries', 'headlined', 'Kevin',

1541211,A2Q31IVRP9MYQX,B0081FSMMO,"William L. Isley, Jr.","[0, 1]","In asking how Christian is the History Channel's miniseries Hatfield & McCoys I do not mean that it was done by a Christian production company, that it has Christian actors and certainly not that it is a series without sexual immorality, crude language and terrible violence.  What I am saying is that the story line concerning the two leaders of the feud has a profoundly Christian message.(If you haven't seen the series, you might not want to read further, since I give away the ending in what follows.)The 3rd and final episode of the miniseries shows the end of the feud and the end of the two leaders of the two families--Randall McCoy and Anderson ""Devil Anse"" Hatfield.  As I argued in my previous post, Hatifields & McCoys: Family Values (You can find it by following this link [...]), Randall McCoy's self-justifying identification of Christianity with his own interests is idolatry.  Hatfields & McCoys vividly portrays the self-destructive end of such a pseudofaith.  When McCoy tragically loses several members of his family to Hatfield attacks, he abandons his false faith in prayer, the Bible and God.  He discovers that his wife's criticism that his prayers seldom work was valid.  He then becomes consumed with vengeance and loses any remaining sense of justice, as well as his sanity, the family he supposedly was fighting for, and finally his life.  In a drunken stupor and alone in his cabin he burns family pictures in the fireplace.  The sleeve of his shirt catches fire, and he perishes as the cabin burns to the ground.Randall McCoy created a faith out of his own interests.  His theology was self-centered rather than God-centered.  Such an ideology, to use Karl Marx's term for philosophical or theological justifications of self-interest, results in isolation, insanity and finally death.  Randall McCoy began with the desire to defend his family.  Because his theology was centered on his own interests, in the end he lost his family.  Because his theology was the creation of his own mind, he was left alone with his thoughts and became insane.  Because his theology was his life, when it failed him, he died.  In fact, his end was a vivid picture of hell--a lonely lost soul being consumed by the flames of its own bitterness.In contrast, ""Devil Anse"" Hatfield, while a brutal leader of his side in the infamous feud, at times shows an ability to see beyond his own self-interest and understand the other person's perspective.  For example, he recognizes that ""Bad"" Frank Phillips was only doing his job as a Pinkerton dectective when, in self-defense, he killed two of Hatfield's kinsmen.  Because his culture's perverted sense of justice required him to do something about Phillips, Hatfield pays him  to leave town rather than kill him.  In the end, Hatfield recognizes that the feud is destroying his family as well as McCoy's.  Rather than rescuing his son from execution or avenge him, he publicly calls off the feud so that litterally there could be peace in the valley.It would appear that Hatfield, perhaps unconcsiously, had recognized the truth of Jesus' words that he who lives by the sword dies by the sword (Matthew 26:52).  On a personal level he saw that true justice and peace came with a recognition of one's own sins and the need for forgiveness from God.  The series ends with ""Devil"" being baptized in the river with family and church members looking on.  A true Christian theology, one that comes from God and not our self-interests and that both condemns us and offers us forgiveness through faith and repentance, brings peace and sanity and life.Historically speaking, it is true that Randall McCoy died in a cabin fire and seems to have never recovered from the feud.  The series's portrayal of his false faith is plausible and certainly dramatically effective, but I can't verify it historically.  The end of Anderson Hatfield is factual.  At age 72 he accepted Christ as his savior in a revival meeting and was baptized on September 23, 1911.  He died peacefully several years later, a part of the greater and eternal family, the family of God.  I have heard that many of his descendants are practicing Christians.  The reality of the gospel that causes us to put God in the center of our life rather than self or family saves us and others.  ""Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it"" (Matthew 10:39).  Now, that's the gospel!",4,How Christian is Hatfields and McCoys,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,4432,"['asking', 'how', 'Christian', 'History', 'Channel', 'miniseries', 'Hatfield', 'McCoys', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'was', 'done', 'Christian', 'production', 'company', 'Christian', 'actors', 'certainly', 'not', 'series', 'sexual', 'immorality', 'crude', 'language', 'terrible', 'violence', 'What', 'am', 'saying', 'story', 'line', 'concerning', 'two', 'leaders', 'feud', 'profoundly', 'Christian', 'message', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'read', 'further', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'what', '3rd', 'final', 'episode', 'miniseries', 'end', 'feud', 'end', 'two', 'leaders', 'two', 'families', 'Randall', 'McCoy', 'Anderson', 'Devil', 'Anse', 'Hatfield', 'argued', 'previous', 'post', 'Hatifields', 'McCoys', 'Family', 'Values', 'can', 'find', 'following', 'link', '[', ']', 'Randall', 'McCoy', 'self-justifying', 'identification', 'Christianity', 'own', 'interests', 'idolatry', 'Hatfields', 'McCoys', 'vividly', 'self-destructive', 'end', 'such', 'pseudofaith', 'When', 'McCoy', 'tragically', 'several', 'members', 'family', 'Hatfield', 'attacks', 'false', 'faith', 'prayer', 'Bible', 'God', 'wife', 'criticism', 'prayers', 'seldom', 'work', 'was', 'valid', 'then', 'consumed', 'vengeance', 'remaining', 'sense', 'justice', 'as', 'well', 'sanity', 'family', 'supposedly', 'was', 'fighting', 'finally', 'life', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'alone', 'cabin', 'family', 'pictures', 'fireplace', 'sleeve', 'shirt', 'catches', 'fire', 'cabin', 'ground.Randall', 'McCoy', 'created', 'faith', 'own', 'interests', 'theology', 'was', 'self-centered', 'rather', 'God-centered', 'ideology', 'use', 'Karl', 'Marx', 'term', 'philosophical', 'theological', 'justifications', 'self-interest', 'results', 'isolation', 'insanity', 'finally', 'death', 'Randall', 'McCoy', 'began', 'desire', 'defend', 'family', 'theology', 'was', 'centered', 'own', 'interests', 'end', 'lost', 'family', 'theology', 'was', 'creation', 'own', 'mind', 'was', 'left', 'alone', 'thoughts', 'became', 'insane', 'theology', 'was', 'life', 'when', 'failed', 'died', 'fact', 'end', 'was', 'vivid', 'picture', 'hell', 'lonely', 'lost', 'soul', 'being', 'consumed', 'flames', 'own', 'bitterness.In', 'contrast', 'Devil', 'Anse', 'Hatfield', 'brutal', 'leader', 'side', 'infamous', 'feud', 'times', 'shows', 'ability', 'see', 'own', 'self-interest', 'understand', 'other', 'person', 'perspective', 'example', 'Bad', 'Frank', 'Phillips', 'was', 'only', 'doing', 'job', 'Pinkerton', 'dectective', 'when', 'self-defense', 'killed', 'two', 'Hatfield', 'kinsmen', 'culture', 'perverted', 'sense', 'justice', 'required', 'do', 'something', 'Phillips', 'Hatfield', 'leave', 'town', 'rather', 'kill', 'end', 'Hatfield', 'feud', 'destroying', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'McCoy', 'rescuing', 'son', 'execution', 'avenge', 'publicly', 'feud', 'litterally', 'could', 'be', 'peace', 'valley.It', 'would', 'appear', 'Hatfield', 'perhaps', 'unconcsiously', 'had', 'recognized', 'truth', 'Jesus', 'words', 'who', 'sword', 'sword', 'Matthew', '26:52', 'personal', 'level', 'saw', 'true', 'justice', 'peace', 'came', 'recognition', 'one', 'own', 'sins', 'need', 'forgiveness', 'God', 'series', 'Devil', 'being', 'baptized', 'river', 'family', 'church', 'members', 'looking', 'true', 'Christian', 'theology', 'one', 'God', 'not', 'self-interests', 'condemns', 'forgiveness', 'faith', 'repentance', 'peace', 'sanity', 'life.Historically', 'speaking', 'true', 'Randall', 'McCoy', 'died', 'cabin', 'fire', 'have', 'never', 'recovered', 'feud', 'series', 'portrayal', 'false', 'faith', 'plausible', 'certainly', 'dramatically', 'effective', 'ca', ""n't"", 'verify', 'historically', 'end', 'Anderson', 'Hatfield', 'factual', 'age', '72', 'accepted', 'Christ', 'savior', 'revival', 'meeting', 'was', 'baptized', 'September', '23', '1911', 'died', 'peacefully', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'part', 'greater', 'eternal', 'family', 'family', 'God', 'have', 'heard', 'many', 'descendants', 'are', 'practicing', 'Christians', 'reality', 'gospel', 'put', 'God', 'center', 'life', 'rather', 'family', 'saves', 'others', 'Whoever', 'life', 'will', 'lose', 'whoever', 'life', 'sake', 'will', 'find', 'Matthew', '10:39', 'Now', 'gospel']",Hatfields & McCoys
