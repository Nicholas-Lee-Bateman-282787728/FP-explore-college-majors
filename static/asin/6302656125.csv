Then they hop a freight train to get far away. George and Lenny go to a ranch to work, they are migrant workers. The scenes suggest the 1930s. Lenny has a problem, George looks after him. The bus driver shows malicious behavior to these strangers, a comment on human nature. Lenny drinks from a stream like an animal. [Symbolism?] Lenny wants what they don't have. George has heavy responsibilities. [Is there a hidden message here?] George has plans of buying a house and land where they can live a settled life. He says Lenny is his cousin and takes care of him. The boss' son throws his status around. Curly's wife flaunts herself; is she trouble?We see a thrashing machine separating wheat from chaff. [Symbolism?] These machines also migrate from farm to farm. The bags of grain are loaded onto horse-drawn wagons. Curly's wife seems lonely and talks to the hired help. Candy has an old dog, lame and toothless. Is it better off dead? [An omen for this story?] Candy had this dog a long time. Curly misses his wife and searches among the hired hands. Candy offers to go in with George and Lenny to buy that farm; he is worried about his future. Curly picks a fight with Lenny and suffers. But he won't retaliate against George and Lenny. The men go into town for the Saturday, Lenny stays behind. The cook is lonely too. Curly's wife is alone and lonely. She wanders into the barn and finds the lifeless pup. What kind of harm can she do? She also had dreams for her future. Will Lenny stroke her soft hair? Will something go terribly wrong? Will Lenny seek refuge in that secret place? Candy enters the barn then tells George about the accident. ""What we gonna do now, George?"" The men form a gang to go after Lenny. George will go to find Lenny. Does Lenny remember what happened? Then George tells Lenny the story about the farm. Will Lenny go to a far better world that he has ever known before?This story seems trivial on the surface. Is it a comment on the migrant workers who have no real home? Was it a subtle story about the bond between two men? Does it show how economic conditions affect the lives of ordinary people? You can compare it to the more restrained version from the 1930s and decide which was better. Was the book better than the film? You can see the care taken to make the details authentic. But an isolated farm would not have electricity in those days, kerosene lanterns would be used at night. That bus in anachronistic, it doesn't have the motor in front (like a truck). The story detracts from this well-acted film.",2,The Lives of Migrant Workers,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,2647,"['film', 'two', 'men', 'being', 'chased', 'armed', 'men', 'dogs', 'jump', 'stream', 'hide', 'Then', 'hop', 'freight', 'train', 'get', 'far', 'away', 'George', 'Lenny', 'go', 'ranch', 'work', 'are', 'migrant', 'workers', 'scenes', 'suggest', '1930s', 'Lenny', 'problem', 'George', 'bus', 'driver', 'malicious', 'behavior', 'strangers', 'comment', 'human', 'nature', 'Lenny', 'drinks', 'stream', 'animal', '[', 'Symbolism', ']', 'Lenny', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'George', 'heavy', 'responsibilities', '[', 'there', 'hidden', 'message', 'here', ']', 'George', 'plans', 'buying', 'house', 'land', 'where', 'can', 'live', 'settled', 'life', 'Lenny', 'cousin', 'care', 'boss', 'son', 'status', 'around', 'Curly', 'wife', 'flaunts', 'trouble', 'see', 'thrashing', 'machine', 'separating', 'wheat', 'chaff', '[', 'Symbolism', 'machines', 'also', 'migrate', 'farm', 'farm', 'bags', 'grain', 'are', 'loaded', 'horse-drawn', 'wagons', 'Curly', 'wife', 'lonely', 'talks', 'hired', 'help', 'Candy', 'old', 'dog', 'lame', 'toothless', 'better', 'off', 'dead', 'omen', 'story', ']', 'Candy', 'had', 'dog', 'long', 'time', 'Curly', 'wife', 'searches', 'hired', 'hands', 'Candy', 'go', 'George', 'Lenny', 'buy', 'farm', 'worried', 'future', 'Curly', 'fight', 'Lenny', 'suffers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'retaliate', 'George', 'Lenny', 'men', 'go', 'town', 'Saturday', 'Lenny', 'cook', 'lonely', 'too', 'Curly', 'wife', 'alone', 'lonely', 'barn', 'lifeless', 'pup', 'What', 'kind', 'harm', 'can', 'do', 'also', 'had', 'dreams', 'future', 'Will', 'Lenny', 'stroke', 'soft', 'hair', 'Will', 'something', 'go', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'Will', 'Lenny', 'seek', 'refuge', 'secret', 'place', 'Candy', 'barn', 'then', 'George', 'accident', 'What', 'gon', 'do', 'now', 'George', 'men', 'form', 'gang', 'go', 'Lenny', 'George', 'will', 'go', 'find', 'Lenny', 'Does', 'Lenny', 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'Then', 'George', 'Lenny', 'story', 'farm', 'Will', 'Lenny', 'go', 'far', 'better', 'world', 'ever', 'known', 'before', 'story', 'trivial', 'surface', 'comment', 'migrant', 'workers', 'who', 'have', 'real', 'home', 'Was', 'subtle', 'story', 'bond', 'two', 'men', 'show', 'how', 'economic', 'conditions', 'affect', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'people', 'can', 'compare', 'more', 'restrained', 'version', '1930s', 'decide', 'was', 'better', 'Was', 'book', 'better', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'care', 'taken', 'make', 'details', 'authentic', 'isolated', 'farm', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'electricity', 'days', 'kerosene', 'lanterns', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'night', 'bus', 'anachronistic', ""n't"", 'have', 'motor', 'front', 'truck', 'story', 'well-acted', 'film']",Of Mice & Men VHS

325954,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,6302656125,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 4]","From the original Steinbeck story to the Horton Foote screen adaptation to the lush cinematography and amazing performances, Gary Sinise's Of Mice And Men is film perfection.  There is a terrible sense of inevitability present from the very beginning of this film; we know that fate will not be kind to Lennie.  But despite his slow march to tragedy we are transfixed by the elegant simplicity of the telling.  Sinise uses his knowledge of theatre to pare this classic story to the bone.Malkovich, always willing to get lost in a part no matter how bizarre or extreme, doesn't act Lennie, he inhabits him.  Watching his childlike behavior and listening to his repetitive monologues we understand completely why George loves him as he does and simultaneously finds him thoroughly maddening.  Malkovich owns this role for all time, I feel badly for every actor attempting it from now on.Extreme roles, like Lennie, allow actors lots of room to show off while simultaneously providing margin for error.  Sinise, as George, has the hardest duty and comes through with a quiet performance that is nothing short of stunning.  Every aspect of his complex relationship with Lennie is revealed almost inadvertently, hope, bitterness, anger, protectiveness, and pride to name just a few.  As director he has stitched together all the elements of this film into an organic whole, no false notes.  As director directing himself he simply inserts his own performance into a complete vision, his embodiment of George is generous - not self-serving.The brilliance of Malkovich and Sinise should not obscure a host of wonderful supporting performances.  Ray Walston (My Favorite Martian) is excellent, Joe Morton is terrific as always, Casey Siemaszko brings real malevolence as only he can, John Terry is thoroughly believable as a crew boss, and Sherilyn Fenn is exactly on point as the player who loses control of the game.  Simply put, Of Mice And Men is what happens on those rare occasions when absolutely everything goes right.",5,This Is What Great Looks Like,1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,2018,"['original', 'Steinbeck', 'story', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'lush', 'cinematography', 'amazing', 'performances', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Mice', 'Men', 'film', 'perfection', 'terrible', 'sense', 'inevitability', 'present', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'know', 'fate', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'kind', 'Lennie', 'slow', 'march', 'tragedy', 'are', 'transfixed', 'elegant', 'simplicity', 'telling', 'Sinise', 'knowledge', 'theatre', 'pare', 'classic', 'story', 'bone.Malkovich', 'always', 'willing', 'get', 'lost', 'part', 'matter', 'how', 'bizarre', 'extreme', ""n't"", 'act', 'Lennie', 'Watching', 'childlike', 'behavior', 'listening', 'repetitive', 'monologues', 'understand', 'completely', 'why', 'George', 'simultaneously', 'thoroughly', 'maddening', 'Malkovich', 'role', 'time', 'feel', 'badly', 'actor', 'attempting', 'now', 'on.Extreme', 'roles', 'Lennie', 'allow', 'actors', 'lots', 'room', 'show', 'off', 'simultaneously', 'providing', 'margin', 'error', 'Sinise', 'George', 'hardest', 'duty', 'through', 'quiet', 'performance', 'nothing', 'short', 'stunning', 'aspect', 'complex', 'relationship', 'Lennie', 'revealed', 'almost', 'inadvertently', 'hope', 'bitterness', 'anger', 'protectiveness', 'pride', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'director', 'stitched', 'together', 'elements', 'film', 'organic', 'whole', 'false', 'notes', 'director', 'directing', 'simply', 'own', 'performance', 'complete', 'vision', 'embodiment', 'George', 'generous', 'not', 'self-serving.The', 'brilliance', 'Malkovich', 'Sinise', 'should', 'not', 'obscure', 'host', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Martian', 'excellent', 'Joe', 'Morton', 'terrific', 'always', 'Casey', 'Siemaszko', 'real', 'malevolence', 'only', 'can', 'John', 'Terry', 'thoroughly', 'believable', 'crew', 'boss', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'exactly', 'point', 'player', 'who', 'control', 'game', 'Simply', 'put', 'Mice', 'Men', 'what', 'rare', 'occasions', 'when', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'right']",Of Mice & Men VHS

In the movie, the view is from far away, and you have no idea what's going to happen, until it actually does, leaving you completely surprised.

I managed to see both adaptions of the film which really helpes me to get the overall storyline clear. This I think was the slightly better version but not by  far.  At the risk of being slightly sterotypical, I would say that having  read the book, Sinise looked remarkably like you would imagine. His acting  was of course inpeccable.  Also the other actor who fitted the part very  well was old Candy. His description almost exactly fitted the one in the  book and the actor played the emotional scenes remarkably well. The only  actor who I didn't fing convincing was Lennie. John Malkovich didn't fit  the role at all and I think the would have been much better off with  someone else. The problem with him (apart from just not looking the part)  was his diction. Lennie may have been stupid but people could understand  him. Malkovich talks like a 2year old throughout and this is really quite  irritating. Other that this fault, the film was very useful to me.

325960,AATD008OTFXT1,6302656125,Bill Fleck,"[20, 23]","There's much to be said for Gary Sinise's adaptation of Steinbeck's 1937 classic, OF MICE AND MEN.  In many ways, it's a better film than the 1939 United Artist's version (currently available on DVD).Part of the reason  for this is the frankness; Steinbeck's language has finally been loosed  from the Breen Office.  Too, the mature themes inherent in the novel are  allowed full play on the screen--the sexual tensions between Steinbeck's  bindle-stiffs and Curley's wife are palpable without being  pornographic.And let it be said right here that Gary Sinise can act  rings around Burgess Meredith in the central role of George.  It is  unlikely anyone will ever nail the part so perfectly again.  These elements  alone make the film worth seeing.For Steinbeck purists, however, some  things are lacking...particularly in the area of characterization.  For all  his effort, Malkovich isn't quite convincing as the giant Lennie, lapsing  into unfortunate Dracula-like hand-flutters in crucial scenes.  He also  tends to underplay and swallow important lines as if thinking, &quot;Hell,  everyone's read this book in high school, so let's get on with  it.&quot;Supporting characters suffer in some cases as well.  While Ray  Walston is quite good as Candy, changes in some of Steinbeck's other  characters are ill-conceived.  Curley's wife--in her late teens in the  novel, and quite harsh--is played as a sympathetic twenty-something by the  beautiful but too-polished Sherilynn Fenn.  The aged, handicapped  African-American Crooks is conversely played by an actor much too young,  and a crucial scene between the two in the book (where she threatens to  frame him for rape) is completely absent here.  The idea seems to be to  drum up sympathy for Fenn's character before her tragic death; this may be  politically correct, but it's poor Steinbeck...and senseless manipulation  in a film that otherwise catches Steinbeck's point of view so well.Sad  to say, some crucial scenes are misdirected.  The central fight between  Lennie and Curley, perfectly realized in the '39 version, is slow and drawn  out here; and is there really any need for the final slow-motion buddy shot  of Lennie and George walking in the field at the end?  These are startling  stylistic lapses in an otherwise tightly-controlled artistic grip.And  yet, in spite of these major flaws, the film has power.  The sets, the  cimematography, and (outside of the fight scene), the editing are perfectly  done, as is the understated musical score.  In short, Sinise has given us a  very worthy version of the Steinbeck tale; a version that's the best one  available in many ways.",4,Steinbeck's Classic Done Right...Almost,917481600,"01 28, 1999",1999,2650,"['much', 'be', 'said', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'adaptation', 'Steinbeck', '1937', 'classic', 'OF', 'MICE', 'AND', 'MEN', 'many', 'ways', 'better', 'film', '1939', 'United', 'Artist', 'version', 'currently', 'available', 'DVD', '.Part', 'reason', 'frankness', 'Steinbeck', 'language', 'finally', 'been', 'loosed', 'Breen', 'Office', 'Too', 'mature', 'inherent', 'novel', 'are', 'allowed', 'full', 'play', 'screen', 'sexual', 'tensions', 'Steinbeck', 'bindle-stiffs', 'Curley', 'wife', 'are', 'palpable', 'being', 'pornographic.And', 'let', 'be', 'said', 'right', 'here', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'can', 'act', 'rings', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'central', 'role', 'George', 'unlikely', 'anyone', 'will', 'ever', 'nail', 'part', 'so', 'perfectly', 'again', 'elements', 'alone', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing.For', 'Steinbeck', 'purists', 'however', 'things', 'are', 'lacking', 'particularly', 'area', 'characterization', 'effort', 'Malkovich', ""n't"", 'quite', 'convincing', 'giant', 'Lennie', 'lapsing', 'unfortunate', 'Dracula-like', 'hand-flutters', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'also', 'underplay', 'swallow', 'important', 'lines', 'thinking', 'quot', 'Hell', 'everyone', 'read', 'book', 'high', 'school', 'let', 'get', 'it.', 'quot', 'Supporting', 'characters', 'suffer', 'cases', 'well', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'quite', 'good', 'Candy', 'changes', 'Steinbeck', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'ill-conceived', 'Curley', 'wife', 'late', 'teens', 'novel', 'quite', 'harsh', 'played', 'sympathetic', 'twenty-something', 'beautiful', 'too-polished', 'Sherilynn', 'Fenn', 'aged', 'handicapped', 'African-American', 'Crooks', 'conversely', 'played', 'actor', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'crucial', 'scene', 'two', 'book', 'where', 'frame', 'rape', 'completely', 'absent', 'here', 'idea', 'be', 'drum', 'up', 'sympathy', 'Fenn', 'character', 'tragic', 'death', 'may', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'poor', 'Steinbeck', 'senseless', 'manipulation', 'film', 'otherwise', 'Steinbeck', 'point', 'view', 'so', 'well.Sad', 'say', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'are', 'misdirected', 'central', 'fight', 'Lennie', 'Curley', 'perfectly', 'realized', ""'39"", 'version', 'slow', 'drawn', 'out', 'here', 'there', 'really', 'need', 'final', 'slow-motion', 'buddy', 'shot', 'Lennie', 'George', 'walking', 'field', 'end', 'are', 'startling', 'stylistic', 'lapses', 'otherwise', 'tightly-controlled', 'artistic', 'grip.And', 'yet', 'spite', 'major', 'flaws', 'film', 'power', 'sets', 'cimematography', 'fight', 'scene', 'editing', 'are', 'perfectly', 'done', 'understated', 'musical', 'score', 'short', 'Sinise', 'given', 'very', 'worthy', 'version', 'Steinbeck', 'tale', 'version', 'best', 'one', 'available', 'many', 'ways']",Of Mice & Men VHS

Never before (or since) have i ever PAID to see a movie in the theatre 4 times. One of the most simplistic enthralling moviegoing experiences one  could ever hope to find. This film ranks on my top 5 films of all time, as  modern films touch us so seldom, you must recognize a crowning acheivement.  I agree with a review below that the cinematography is one of a kind.  The blowing barley fields, periwinkle skies and dusty roads are almost felt  by the viewer upon watching. I do not think there is a comparison to be  made with the 1939 version. Malkovich acts circles around Lon Chaney and  Gary Sinise's masterful subtle performance makes Burgess Meredith look  foolish. Such a shame that more people did not find this treasure while in  the theatres. Believe it or not, when I first met my future husband, he  informed me that not only had he seen this version of &quot;Of Mice &amp;  men&quot; (Which was an absolute first for me, I thought I was the only one  for a while) He had given it 4 stars in his personal review.

All the way around, where ever you look, this film confronts you with sadness.  The story of George (Gary Sinise) and his retarded cousin Lennie (John Malkovich) is one for everyone to hear.  During the depression these two traveling buddies look for work in California, and get work on a farm.  Their not looking for any trouble, but trouble seems to find them in the name of Curley (Casey Siemaszko), the farm owners son, 'one of those little people that don't like big people', and because of that he has something against Lennie.  Lennie is just a big teddy bear, one who likes to touch everything soft with his fingers, but he tends too touch them to hard.  When trouble rears it's head in the form of an accident George is forced to make a choice regarding his relationship with Lennie.  I don't want to say anymore for the less you know the better, but most of you have read the book or seen the original and so you probably know the ending.  I just want to warn you that I've never been so depressed after watching a film as I was after watching this.  That said, this is a masterpiece of a film and one of the best I've ever seen.  Every performance is brilliant especially Malkovich who makes you love him and cry for him in almost every scene, as well as Sherilyn Fenn who plays Curley's lonely wife who seeks out George and eventually Lennie for attention.  The sadness isn't without point I might add, for this film serves as a great example of how 'not' to treat others for it shows it heartwrenching detail the effect we have on others when we mistreat them, no matter what the reason.  The phrase alone, 'of mice and men', is in reference, not to literal mice and men but to the simplicity in equality, how we, no matter what our race, social status or disability are all equal...theres no difference in mice and men for we are all the same.

But these little changes matter not...the soul of each character is captured perfectly by this amazing movie!Lennie and George are partners in their walk through life, and they couldn't be more opposite: Lennie (Malkovich) is a child in a big man's body, and George (Sinise) is the quick thinking (though never quite quick enough) sidekick determined to watch after his friend.

Gary Sinise's film is a truthful adaptation, with only some slight changes, and captures the mood of the book pretty well.  I have to say that the most moving scene for me is still the final one. It brings tears to my eyes, every time. The cinematography is beautiful, all green foliage and crisp golden wheat - the use of light is particularly effective in moments such as the pivotal barn scene, where the golden beams peering through the darkened slats of wood make the picture both shadowy and light at the same time ...  John Malkovich is excellent as the retarded Lennie - it is always difficult to accept watching a well-known and intelligent actor play a retard, but he manages to defeat the viewer's preconceptions, and he convincingly shows Lennie's childishness, his incomprehension. Gary Sinise is perfect as George: physically suited, subtle and deeply moving.  Hehe ... now for the inevitable nit-picking. The main problem - though not so much a problem as a bit too much of a good thing - is that the setting seems to have been evoked so caringly it is almost too lavish.  It threatens to make the workers' lifestyle seem too attractive, not more detached and monotonous as it appears in the book. The support cast, while good are maybe sometimes too obviously sympathetic - Curley's wife's mean streak has been played down, and Slim seems more ordinary, less detached and &quot;majestic&quot; than in the book.  These are minor flaws though. In fact, the film's structure is quite sparse, and does not fall into the trap that other adaptations can, of sprawling or simply relying on the book's clout and key scenes to see them through.

There is an element of pathos that is totally missing.  Likewise Sinise is too tall for George, too good looking and kind - too much a Hollwood actor, or more acurately Chicago's idea of what a Californian is. George is more of a tough guy, a small scrappy man.The biggest problem is Curley's wife - I do not know whether it was out of some misguided PC sensibility or what but the attempt to humanize her misfires and skews the balance of the story.  She is supposed to be a loose woman, more dangerous, and the added dialogue and scenes throw too much balance over towards her - and why?  She isn't the center of focus, and it takes away from the harsh reality of this story set during the Great Depression. She should be more of a femme fatale, not the nice misunderstood bored house wife.If they had used the real Salinas area - and if it is too urbanized there are plenty of areas south near Soledad or Greenfield - that would have been better.  The Santa Ynez Valley is too mountainous - the Big Sur and Gabilan ranges are more gentle.  The farm was too often bathed in golden mountain sunlight.  Most of the farms near Salinas are not far from the ocean, so the climate is damper.The beginning of the film is all wrong - the dramatic posse chasing Lennie and George out of Weed - very Hollywood, and the setting for Weed (near Mount Shasta) is way off.  The ending without Carlson, Curley and Slim entering to find a dead Lennie is all wrong.Stay with the classic b/w version with Chaney and Meredith.

326003,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6302656125,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 7]","I've been reading ""Of Mice and Men"" for a class I'm in and even though I've liked what I've read of the book (I haven't even reached Chapter 3), I didn't have an overwhelming desire to see the movie. That was until I found out one of my favorite actors John Malkovich is in it. I went out and got it the day I heard that information. As I said, I've only read 1 1/2 chapters; So I don't know how faithful it is to the book, but the first few minutes were pretty faithful. Having said that, this review is for the movie and is based on the movie and nothing more. The movie is directed by Gary Sinise, with a script by two-time Oscar winning screenwriter Horton Foote; A screenwriter who had already penned a screenplay based on a great American novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Since ""Of Mice and Men"" is considered one of the great American novels and it's author (John Steinbeck) one of the great American novelists, it's no doubt a daunting task to write the script. The film, however, is a complete cinematic triumph. The casting here is absolutely perfect. Sinise (an actor I pictured while reading the book) plays George and Malkovich plays Lennie. One of the things I love about Malkovich is his voice and I tend to hate it when he changes it to fit a character or an accent (i.e., Shadow of the Vampire). Here, I didn't mind it. In fact, I think it's one of Malkovich's best performances. George is a short, rough-around-the-edges kind of guy that is smart and hardworking, while Lennie is a hulking giant of a man with a good heart and the personality and wit of a baby. Both men are Depression-era workers, who are unable to hold a job because of Lennie's misgivings. They had a job in Weed, but were forced to flee when Lennie scared a woman by grabbing a hold of her dress (he liked the color). They arrive at the Tyler Ranch, with dreams of one day buying a house with a couple of acres and room for animals. Lennie will be able to tend to rabbits. Whenever George tells this story to Lennie, we see him happy. In fact, the only time George seems happy is when he's telling this story. At the farm, things go both ways for the fellas. They make some friends, like Candy (Ray Walston, in a great performance far away from Mr. Hand) and Slim (John Terry); But they also have to put up with the sadistic son-of-the-boss Curley (Casey Siemaszko). Worse yet, they have to put up with his unhappy and lonely wife (Sherilyn Fenn, 'Boxing Helena') who longs to talk to someone, but doesn't realize that by talking to the men she starts problems with Curley. A lot of people can put characters on paper that the audience really cares for, but it takes a really good actor to make you care for them onscreen. Malkovich and Sinise do just that. You like these characters. You get happy when something good happens to them and instantly depressed when it doesn't. Both give Oscar worthy work here and it amazes me that neither one scored an Oscar nomination (I'm not even sure if this film got nominated for ANY Oscar). Sinise is a great actor, with fantastic range...He captures the character of George so clearly and vividly, there's times where you forget he's acting at all. Malkovich is an absolute wonder to watch. What a complete actor this man is. He immerses himself into the role of Lennie; He has the voice and the movement and everything else down. This performance is just as good as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump and Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. The ending of the film is incredibly well written. I think the ending of the movie works better than the ending of the book (I skipped ahead a little bit). The last words are more poignant in the movie than in the book. Being as how I hadn't read that far when I saw the movie, the ending hit me even harder since I didn't know what was coming. It seems that people on Amazon like this film, which I'm quite happy to see. Because this is a great film on any level. Even if it bared no similarity to the book at all, this is a true masterpiece. If you have any appreciation for cinema, vivid characters, a great story, and amazing acting. See this movie. It's not necessarily a joyful, happy journey...But it's definitely one you want to take.GRADE: A+",5,A Great Film...,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,4205,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'Mice', 'Men', 'class', ""'m"", 'even', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'reached', 'Chapter', '3', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'overwhelming', 'desire', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'found', 'out', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'went', 'out', 'got', 'day', 'heard', 'information', 'said', ""'ve"", 'only', 'read', '1', '1/2', 'chapters', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'faithful', 'book', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'were', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'Having', 'said', 'review', 'movie', 'based', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'movie', 'directed', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'script', 'two-time', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'screenwriter', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'A', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'penned', 'screenplay', 'based', 'great', 'American', 'novel', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Mice', 'Men', 'considered', 'one', 'great', 'American', 'novels', 'author', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'one', 'great', 'American', 'novelists', 'doubt', 'daunting', 'task', 'write', 'script', 'film', 'however', 'complete', 'cinematic', 'triumph', 'casting', 'here', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'Sinise', 'actor', 'pictured', 'reading', 'book', 'George', 'Malkovich', 'Lennie', 'One', 'things', 'love', 'Malkovich', 'voice', 'tend', 'hate', 'when', 'fit', 'character', 'accent', 'i.e.', 'Shadow', 'Vampire', 'Here', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'fact', 'think', 'one', 'Malkovich', 'best', 'performances', 'George', 'short', 'rough-around-the-edges', 'kind', 'guy', 'smart', 'hardworking', 'Lennie', 'hulking', 'giant', 'man', 'good', 'heart', 'personality', 'wit', 'baby', 'men', 'are', 'Depression-era', 'workers', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'hold', 'job', 'Lennie', 'misgivings', 'had', 'job', 'Weed', 'were', 'forced', 'flee', 'when', 'Lennie', 'scared', 'woman', 'grabbing', 'hold', 'dress', 'liked', 'color', 'arrive', 'Tyler', 'Ranch', 'dreams', 'one', 'day', 'buying', 'house', 'couple', 'acres', 'room', 'animals', 'Lennie', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'tend', 'rabbits', 'Whenever', 'George', 'story', 'Lennie', 'see', 'happy', 'fact', 'only', 'time', 'George', 'happy', 'when', 'telling', 'story', 'farm', 'things', 'go', 'ways', 'fellas', 'make', 'friends', 'Candy', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'great', 'performance', 'far', 'away', 'Mr.', 'Hand', 'Slim', 'John', 'Terry', 'also', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'sadistic', 'son-of-the-boss', 'Curley', 'Casey', 'Siemaszko', 'Worse', 'yet', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'unhappy', 'lonely', 'wife', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', ""'Boxing"", 'Helena', 'who', 'talk', 'someone', ""n't"", 'realize', 'talking', 'men', 'problems', 'Curley', 'lot', 'people', 'can', 'put', 'characters', 'paper', 'audience', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'actor', 'make', 'care', 'onscreen', 'Malkovich', 'Sinise', 'do', 'just', 'characters', 'get', 'happy', 'when', 'something', 'good', 'happens', 'instantly', 'depressed', 'when', ""n't"", 'give', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'work', 'here', 'one', 'scored', 'Oscar', 'nomination', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'film', 'got', 'nominated', 'ANY', 'Oscar', 'Sinise', 'great', 'actor', 'fantastic', 'range', 'character', 'George', 'clearly', 'vividly', 'times', 'where', 'forget', 'acting', 'Malkovich', 'absolute', 'wonder', 'watch', 'What', 'complete', 'actor', 'man', 'role', 'Lennie', 'voice', 'movement', 'everything', 'else', 'down', 'performance', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Rain', 'Man', 'ending', 'film', 'incredibly', 'well', 'written', 'think', 'ending', 'movie', 'better', 'ending', 'book', 'skipped', 'ahead', 'little', 'bit', 'last', 'words', 'are', 'more', 'poignant', 'movie', 'book', 'Being', 'how', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'far', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'ending', 'hit', 'even', 'harder', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'people', 'Amazon', 'film', ""'m"", 'quite', 'happy', 'see', 'great', 'film', 'level', 'Even', 'bared', 'similarity', 'book', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'have', 'appreciation', 'cinema', 'vivid', 'characters', 'great', 'story', 'amazing', 'acting', 'See', 'movie', 'not', 'necessarily', 'joyful', 'happy', 'journey', 'definitely', 'one', 'want', 'take.GRADE', 'A+']",Of Mice & Men VHS

From the very opening of the film, we see cousins George and Lenny running and a woman in a ripped red dress screaming for help.We are alerted from the start where this story is going.The thing is, we don't want it to go there,but it will;it is inevitable.So sit back and you will NOT relax because the tension is palpable and the result will come.Now that is a very different take from many films today in that you will be surprised by outcomes and all the twists and turns;but not so in this amazing Gary Sinise directed-Horton Foote scripted tale of two men who must come to their fate.Gary Sinise is the tough but tender George who has always looked after the dim-witted but lovable Lenny.It is obvious early on that George has considered Lenny a millstone around his neck;but there is a genuine love there for him despite that.Lenny (the best John Malkovich other than DANGEROUS LIAISONS) is the clumsy,oafish ""gentle giant"" who caresses  things too tightly often killing them unintentionally.Their relationship is played out among the migrant working men of the Tyler Ranch,California.Curly (Casey Siemaszko) is boss's ""short"" tyrant of a son who beats and neglects his wife (Sherilynn Fenn) and has a Napoleonic complex that sets him squarely against the giant innocent Lenny.The wife is always hanging about all the men.She is desperately lonely.She spells trouble from the start.Sinise takes us very deliberately through each scene,allowing each character to develop just enough, only to bring them to their ultimate reckoning.There is not one false note,one false step in this film;it is seamless in it's direction and flawless in the screenplay and acting.It is tough and tender and forceful.I cannot recommend a film more highly.Mark Isham provides a beautiful Aaron Copelandesque Americana soundtrack.Great companion films would be DOMINICK AND EUGENE and FRANKENSTEIN (believe it or not) and INFAMOUS for the misunderstood ""gentle giant"" feebleminded character.

""Of Mice and Men"" is a marvelous picture that plays on all of our emotions.The movie is about two men who travel together all the time, hoping to own an acre of land and a nice home they can call their own. George is a smart man who always seems to have things figured out. Lennie is a giant with a mind of a young child. George looks after him, but it is not easy. Lennie always seems to get himself in some kind of trouble, and George is always the one who has to help him out.  The two eventually land jobs on a ranch, hoping to make enough money to make their dreams come true.  But that might be difficult when Lennie once again gets the two in serious trouble.The movie is directed by Gary Sinise, who does a spectacular job of bringing Steinbeck's wonderful novel to life.  Just from seeing this movie alone, I think he has nothing but talent when it comes to sitting in the director's chair.  He really should direct more.  Also, he is a great actor, and plays the role of George flawlessly.  He's everything I envisioned when reading the book.John Malkovich plays Lennie, and does an outstanding job at doing so.  I sort of had my doubts at first, because I thought of Lennie as a giant, and Malkovich didn't seem like a giant to me.  Well, when I was watching the movie, that all changed.  He did the part justice.  It's a crime that he didn't win anything for his role (or at least nothing I am aware of.)The movie stays very true to the book.  Sure, as always, there are things removed or added.  Mostly, there are things added because the novel is so short, they needed to add things to make the movie longer.  Everything that was added worked and stayed true to the original story.The picture and sound quality was really up to par.  It is 16:9 widescreen; aspect ratio 1.85:1.  It looked really good; very crystal clear.  Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't have much to offer in the special features department, with the exception of a trailer for the movie.""Of Mice and Men"" is a spectacular movie that should've won a couple of Academy Awards.  Everything about this film was outstanding.  It is one I will watch over and over again.  If you loved the book, chances are you will love the movie.

What makes this 1992 adaptation of Steinbeck's classic so great is Sinise's sensitive direction as well as his strong and understated performance, but it's John Malkovich who steals the show in one of his career best performances as the sympathetic Lennie who is trying to survive in a world he was never meant for.

FOREMAN,"[54, 59]","I cannot think of a movie adaptation of a ""classic"" novel in which the actors were more suited for their roles than OF MICE AND MEN (THE CRUCIBLE is close. . .).  No offense to Burgess Meredith (from the 1939 version), but John Malkovich was born to play this role (Lennie)!  His physical mannerisms (walking, sitting, working in the fields, etc.), his vocal stylings, and his slightly cross-eyed status all contribute to the overwhelming ""Lennie-ness"" he conveys.  His smile is the one I see when I think of George telling the ""tend the rabbits"" story; his voice is what I hear when I read the book now.  Malkovich IS Lennie (or vice versa. . .).  Gary Sinise is perfect as the quiet and understated George--he never tries to steal the show but lets the script and the plot situations stay in top priority position.  The supporting actors are all extremely good, from Curly, his wife, Candy, Crooks, Slim, and the farm hands--no weak links in the chain whatsoever, which is rare.  Exceptional performances all the way around, with great leadership from the two primary actors.The script is as good as you can possibly get from an adaptation.  It is not ""word-for-word,"" but it is close enough for me as a high school English teacher.  The differences, both additions and omissions, are not significant enough to draw any criticism for me, and they provide for interesting analysis (compare/contrast) for my students.Despite the exceptional quality of this movie, the kids still like it!!  Some very good movies are just too ""good"" for high school students to appreciate (THE GREAT GATSBY comes to mind), but this one hits them hard.  They identify very easily with George and Lennie's plight (with some help from a history lesson in Depression era economics), Lennie (Malkovich) is an incredibly likable guy, despite his obvious weaknesses and social/mental deficiencies; George scores major points from the kids for his incredibly kind treatment (for the most part) of Lennie.  The students are drawn to the very compelling social situation into which Lennie's actions force the two workers.  The climax of the movie is shattering.  Even though they know what is coming, the visual realization is difficult to watch without emotional reaction.  I believe Steinbeck would have given Sinise ""two thumbs up"" for the last ten minutes of the movie, in particular.Bottom Line:  You're not going to find a much more compelling story, either in print or in a movie.  The themes may seem slightly outdated when looked at in the microcosm of the Depression Era, but Steinbeck presented a big picture with these two characters and their plight that even today's kids can appreciate.

326033,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,6302656125,Shashank Tripathi,"[9, 10]","What a masterful and faithful portrayal of Steinbeck's classic (eponymous) novel. The screenplay brings to life the tragic yet uplifting story of loyalty and the kind of bond that can grow between men that we are often reluctant to acknowledge, much less show.Aside from the story, the cast is what really makes this film. I have always held a soft spot for Gary Sinise after his role in Forrest Gump, wherein his character portrayed another facet of the bonding between men made brothers by cruel circumstance, yet can grow and flourish as the years and other circumstances come to pass. Here, as Lenny's friend and protector against a world that baffles and confuses him, he shows the kind of rough-edged tenderness and affection that both endears us to his plight, and fills us with the dread of what we know must come between the men.John Malkovich shows his range as an actor by bringing to life the dull-witted but pure-hearted Lenny, in a way that will tug at your heartstrings. I found myself both laughing (in a sad way) at Lenny's ineptness in dealing with a world clearly more confusing than his limited wits can manage, and crying over his being targeted for taunting and abuse by cruel and crude men, and ultimately done in by his brute strength when it was lacking the direction and temper given by his friend George.A pleasant surprise was Ray Walston as the aged but gentle and good-hearted ranch hand Candy, who has no one in life to love but his old sheepdog, who, like him, he knows, must ultimately be &quot;put down&quot; because of age and the wear and tear that a life of hard labor has worn down. The scene of his finally surrendering his faithful canine companion to be euthanized by a gunshot to the back of the head by another well-meaning field hand is very heartbreaking. Having grown up with the &quot;Uncle Martin&quot; of &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; Walston, seeing his adept performance in a dramatic role gave me a new appreciation for his versatility as a character actor.Those who watch this film should allow plenty of time alone to view it straight through with no interruptions. Swallow your pride and keep a box of tissues handy, and some time afterwards for quiet contemplation and &quot;recovery.&quot;",4,MASTERFUL ADAPTATION OF CLASSIC STEINBECK NOVEL,1066089600,"10 14, 2003",2003,2248,"['What', 'masterful', 'faithful', 'portrayal', 'Steinbeck', 'classic', 'eponymous', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'life', 'tragic', 'yet', 'uplifting', 'story', 'loyalty', 'kind', 'bond', 'can', 'grow', 'men', 'are', 'often', 'reluctant', 'acknowledge', 'much', 'less', 'show.Aside', 'story', 'cast', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'have', 'always', 'held', 'soft', 'spot', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'role', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'wherein', 'character', 'portrayed', 'facet', 'bonding', 'men', 'made', 'brothers', 'cruel', 'circumstance', 'yet', 'can', 'grow', 'flourish', 'years', 'other', 'circumstances', 'come', 'pass', 'Here', 'Lenny', 'friend', 'protector', 'world', 'baffles', 'kind', 'rough-edged', 'tenderness', 'affection', 'endears', 'plight', 'dread', 'what', 'know', 'must', 'come', 'men.John', 'Malkovich', 'range', 'actor', 'bringing', 'life', 'dull-witted', 'pure-hearted', 'Lenny', 'way', 'will', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'found', 'laughing', 'sad', 'way', 'Lenny', 'ineptness', 'dealing', 'world', 'clearly', 'more', 'confusing', 'limited', 'wits', 'can', 'manage', 'crying', 'over', 'being', 'targeted', 'taunting', 'abuse', 'cruel', 'crude', 'men', 'ultimately', 'done', 'brute', 'strength', 'when', 'was', 'lacking', 'direction', 'temper', 'given', 'friend', 'George.A', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'was', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'aged', 'gentle', 'good-hearted', 'ranch', 'hand', 'Candy', 'who', 'one', 'life', 'love', 'old', 'sheepdog', 'who', 'must', 'ultimately', 'be', 'quot', 'put', 'down', 'quot', 'age', 'wear', 'tear', 'life', 'hard', 'labor', 'worn', 'down', 'scene', 'finally', 'surrendering', 'faithful', 'canine', 'companion', 'be', 'euthanized', 'gunshot', 'back', 'head', 'well-meaning', 'field', 'hand', 'very', 'heartbreaking', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'quot', 'Uncle', 'Martin', 'quot', 'quot', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Martian', 'quot', 'Walston', 'seeing', 'adept', 'performance', 'dramatic', 'role', 'gave', 'new', 'appreciation', 'versatility', 'character', 'actor.Those', 'who', 'watch', 'film', 'should', 'allow', 'plenty', 'time', 'alone', 'view', 'straight', 'interruptions', 'Swallow', 'pride', 'keep', 'box', 'tissues', 'handy', 'time', 'afterwards', 'quiet', 'contemplation', 'quot', 'quot']",Of Mice & Men VHS

326036,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,6302656125,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[1, 5]","+++++This movie is based on the 1937 novella (of about a hundred pages) by John Steinbeck (1902 to 1968).  Gary Sinise, who stars in the movie, also co-produced and directed it.The movie (and novel) is set during the time of the Great (Economic) Depression (that began in 1929 and lasted through most of the 1930s).The movie is a dark tale that presents a human world that contains jealously, cruelty, loneliness, rootlessness, poverty, and shattered dreams.  It is a parable about two men, George (Sinise) and Lennie (John Malkovich), striving for a better life, who long for self-respect, independence, and freedom.Lennie is a mentally deficient but a big, strong man who has a childlike innocence and is fascinated with soft things (like rabbits).  George, the smarter of the two, travels with him and is his protector.  The only thing they have in common is each other.  George explains, ""I got you to look after me and you got me to look after you.""Their dream?  To own their own place and ""to live off the fat of the land.""  However, their plan to reach this dream does not work out.  The title of this movie (and the novel) gives this away.  It's from a phrase in a famous poet's 1785 poem:  ""The best laid dreams o'mice and men [often go awry].""I believe that those who have not read the novel might give this movie 5 stars.  The story is well presented.  John Malkovich's performance as Lennie is exceptional.  They should also be impressed with the cinematography and background music.However, those who have read the novel will probably see some problems.  The main problem, I feel, is with Gary Sinise as George.  He plays his role as too intelligent and I didn't feel that there was a strong, emotional connection between George and Lennie.As well, even though all major scenes from the novel are presented, many of them are abbreviated thus leaving out important stuff Steinbeck was attempting to convey.  The dialogue in the movie seems to be too articulate.  The dialogue in the novel presents real depression-era talking (and is a highlight of the novel) where such words as ""pretty"" are pronounced ""purty"" and ""picture"" is pronounced ""pitcher.""  Finally, the ending of the novel is its highpoint but in the movie, it seems to me to be rushed and thus its emotional impact is lost (at least to me).I believe those who have read the novel might give this movie 3.5 stars.  My actual rating of this movie is an average of the sum of these two ratings and is shown below.Finally, the DVD itself (special edition) has good picture and sound quality.  There are six interesting extras.In conclusion, we all have a dream.
