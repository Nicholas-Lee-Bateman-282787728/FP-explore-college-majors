770785,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0000BV1YO,Andy Orrock,"[6, 6]","In 'Trembling Before God,' director Sandi Simcha Dubowski has compiled an emotional series of interviews and vignettes featuring Orthodox Jews - unwilling to renounce their religion (indeed, in some cases reaffirming their faith) in the face of harsh and unrelenting negative treatment of their sexuality.  First and foremost, you have to credit the bravery of the people willing to appear in the film.  Although some of them have come out, it's obvious in a couple of cases that their families will find out only with the release of the film.The first of two standouts is David - a professional 30-to-40 something from California.  He's back to re-connect with his rabbi, who years back had prescribed an odd treatment of snapping a rubber band snapping on his wrist (and other trite measures) to ward away his deviant thoughts.  Well, David says, they didn't work.  Now what?  Hoping to hear his rabbi offer some degreee of acceptance (and on the whole the rabbi is presented by Dubowski as a reasonable man), instead he gets more of the same: there's no room for this behavior in our religion basically.  The real tears the follow from David provide the movie's most seminal moment.The second standout is 58-year-old Israel, living monogamously with his long-time partner.  Israel has been estranged from his 98 (!) year-old father for decades.  In the movie, we see Israel calling his Dad on the phone, having a conversation in Yiddish, trying to reach out to him.  Still, 98 and holding firm.  Israel and his partner shake their heads with disappointment.Thanks Sandi Simcha Dubowski, for your great perseverance in getting these electric moments on film.",5,An electric documentary from Sandi Simcha Dubowski,1081641600,"04 11, 2004",2004,1660,"[""'Trembling"", 'God', 'director', 'Sandi', 'Simcha', 'Dubowski', 'compiled', 'emotional', 'series', 'interviews', 'vignettes', 'featuring', 'Orthodox', 'Jews', 'unwilling', 'renounce', 'religion', 'indeed', 'cases', 'reaffirming', 'faith', 'face', 'harsh', 'unrelenting', 'negative', 'treatment', 'sexuality', 'First', 'foremost', 'have', 'credit', 'bravery', 'people', 'willing', 'appear', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'obvious', 'couple', 'cases', 'families', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'only', 'release', 'film.The', 'first', 'two', 'standouts', 'David', 'professional', '30-to-40', 'something', 'California', 'back', 're-connect', 'rabbi', 'who', 'years', 'back', 'had', 'prescribed', 'odd', 'treatment', 'snapping', 'rubber', 'band', 'snapping', 'wrist', 'other', 'trite', 'measures', 'ward', 'away', 'deviant', 'thoughts', 'Well', 'David', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Now', 'what', 'Hoping', 'hear', 'rabbi', 'offer', 'degreee', 'acceptance', 'whole', 'rabbi', 'presented', 'Dubowski', 'reasonable', 'man', 'instead', 'more', 'same', 'room', 'behavior', 'religion', 'basically', 'real', 'follow', 'David', 'provide', 'movie', 'most', 'seminal', 'moment.The', 'second', 'standout', '58-year-old', 'Israel', 'living', 'monogamously', 'long-time', 'partner', 'Israel', 'been', 'estranged', '98', 'year-old', 'father', 'decades', 'movie', 'see', 'Israel', 'calling', 'Dad', 'phone', 'having', 'conversation', 'Yiddish', 'trying', 'reach', 'out', 'Still', '98', 'holding', 'firm', 'Israel', 'partner', 'shake', 'heads', 'disappointment.Thanks', 'Sandi', 'Simcha', 'Dubowski', 'great', 'perseverance', 'getting', 'electric', 'moments', 'film']",N/A
770786,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B0000BV1YO,Anyechka,"[3, 3]","This moving documentary really merits being seen by everyone, no matter what their religion or sexual orientation.  While the issue of being both gay and Jewish doesn't seem like a conflict to those in the liberal denominations, it's a much more complex and anguished issue for those who wish to remain true to both parts of their core identity, living a frum life and being gay.  It seems like a dire contradiction in terms to devote your life to a religious tradition that essentially denies who you are, but for the brave individuals who agreed to appear in this film (some of them with false names or appearing in silhouette or with blurred faces), being Orthodox and still gay isn't a contradiction at all.For too many people, the issue of Judaism and homosexuality is a cut and dried prohibition, one verse in Leviticus.  They don't have any real-life experience with it, or think it doesn't exist in their ultra-frum communities.  But this documentary puts faces to that one verse, shows the people who are in very real pain and conflict over this.  It's easy to condemn or dismiss something when it only exists in theory, something you've read about, not something you suddenly find yourself dealing with in your own family or community.  People like Leah, Malka, Michelle, David, Israel, Mark, and Devorah are real people who have been living this double identity for years, struggling to come to terms with their orientation and how to still be frum in spite of it.  I think it's quite refreshing how the rabbis who appear in this film, though some of them are quite Orthodox, are speaking from personal experience in dealing with gay people.  While the Orthodox hold to the belief that the Torah is 100% the literal word of Hashem, these rabbis are flexible and compassionate enough, within that very conservative framework, to reinterpret the verse to find some sort of realistic solution to this problem.  Many people are killing themselves or suffering from depression because there is no support network for frum gays; it's completely unfair to compare not following this one particular mitzvah to deciding to also ignore mitzvot such as kashrut and keeping Shabbos.  Halacha is really not set in stone, and an alternative answer can always be found even with an Orthodox approach to reading the text.  It's also surprising how some of these long-bearded rabbis are more progressive and understanding than some secular people.It's unfathomable that anyone, after seeing this film and getting to know these people, could still insist that homosexuality is wrong because it's in the Torah, and that settles that issue.  Anyone with a heart would see the pain and frustration in people like Israel, desperate to reunite with his 98 year old dad; Devorah, who is married to a man in spite of being a lesbian; and Mark, who misses the yeshiva world even though he was estranged from it after coming out.  One's heart goes out to these people who either have to live double lives or live as openly gay in a world where early heterosexual marriage and large families are considered not only the norm, but the only way to live.  Hopefully some halachic solutions will be found for this issue sooner than later, so that the next generation of people like Malka, Michelle, David, and Israel won't have to struggle with being frum gays.The second disc contains a wealth of extras that really enhance the documentary.  Among them are an interview with Rabbi Steve Greenberg (whom I was honored to meet when he spoke at my [Conservative] shul in December '06), an interview with director Sandi Simcha Dubowski, a featurette, 'Trembling on the Road,' the trailer, interviews with five of the prominent rabbis featured in the documentary (and while they're quite Orthodox, they also seem compassionate and open-minded, wanting to find a halachic solution to this issue instead of just telling gay people to live celibate lives or pretend to be straight), a deleted scene, a discussion with people involved in Petach Lev, an Israeli group dealing with these issues, footage of an arcane Medieval ceremony to atone for ""sexual sins,"" and so much more.",5,Putting faces to a verse,1210809600,"05 15, 2008",2008,4149,"['moving', 'documentary', 'really', 'merits', 'being', 'seen', 'everyone', 'matter', 'what', 'religion', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'issue', 'being', 'gay', 'Jewish', ""n't"", 'seem', 'conflict', 'liberal', 'denominations', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'anguished', 'issue', 'who', 'wish', 'remain', 'true', 'parts', 'core', 'identity', 'living', 'frum', 'life', 'being', 'gay', 'dire', 'contradiction', 'terms', 'devote', 'life', 'religious', 'tradition', 'essentially', 'who', 'are', 'brave', 'individuals', 'who', 'agreed', 'appear', 'film', 'false', 'names', 'appearing', 'silhouette', 'blurred', 'being', 'Orthodox', 'still', 'gay', ""n't"", 'contradiction', 'all.For', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'issue', 'Judaism', 'homosexuality', 'cut', 'dried', 'prohibition', 'one', 'verse', 'Leviticus', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'real-life', 'experience', 'think', ""n't"", 'exist', 'ultra-frum', 'communities', 'documentary', 'one', 'verse', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'pain', 'conflict', 'easy', 'condemn', 'dismiss', 'something', 'when', 'only', 'theory', 'something', ""'ve"", 'read', 'not', 'something', 'suddenly', 'find', 'dealing', 'own', 'family', 'community', 'People', 'Leah', 'Malka', 'Michelle', 'David', 'Israel', 'Mark', 'Devorah', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'double', 'identity', 'years', 'struggling', 'come', 'terms', 'orientation', 'how', 'still', 'be', 'frum', 'spite', 'think', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'how', 'rabbis', 'who', 'appear', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'Orthodox', 'are', 'speaking', 'personal', 'experience', 'dealing', 'gay', 'people', 'Orthodox', 'hold', 'belief', 'Torah', '100', '%', 'literal', 'word', 'Hashem', 'rabbis', 'are', 'flexible', 'compassionate', 'enough', 'very', 'conservative', 'framework', 'reinterpret', 'verse', 'find', 'sort', 'realistic', 'solution', 'problem', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'killing', 'suffering', 'depression', 'support', 'network', 'frum', 'gays', 'completely', 'unfair', 'compare', 'not', 'following', 'one', 'particular', 'mitzvah', 'deciding', 'also', 'ignore', 'mitzvot', 'such', 'kashrut', 'keeping', 'Shabbos', 'Halacha', 'really', 'not', 'set', 'stone', 'alternative', 'answer', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'found', 'even', 'Orthodox', 'approach', 'reading', 'text', 'also', 'surprising', 'how', 'long-bearded', 'rabbis', 'are', 'more', 'progressive', 'understanding', 'secular', 'people.It', 'unfathomable', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'film', 'getting', 'know', 'people', 'could', 'still', 'insist', 'homosexuality', 'wrong', 'Torah', 'issue', 'Anyone', 'heart', 'would', 'see', 'pain', 'frustration', 'people', 'Israel', 'desperate', 'reunite', '98', 'year', 'old', 'dad', 'Devorah', 'who', 'married', 'man', 'spite', 'being', 'lesbian', 'Mark', 'who', 'yeshiva', 'world', 'even', 'was', 'estranged', 'coming', 'out', 'One', 'heart', 'out', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'live', 'double', 'lives', 'live', 'openly', 'gay', 'world', 'where', 'early', 'heterosexual', 'marriage', 'large', 'families', 'are', 'considered', 'not', 'only', 'norm', 'only', 'way', 'live', 'Hopefully', 'halachic', 'solutions', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'issue', 'sooner', 'later', 'next', 'generation', 'people', 'Malka', 'Michelle', 'David', 'Israel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'struggle', 'being', 'frum', 'gays.The', 'second', 'disc', 'wealth', 'extras', 'really', 'enhance', 'documentary', 'are', 'interview', 'Rabbi', 'Steve', 'Greenberg', 'whom', 'was', 'honored', 'meet', 'when', 'spoke', '[', 'Conservative', ']', 'shul', 'December', ""'06"", 'interview', 'director', 'Sandi', 'Simcha', 'Dubowski', 'featurette', ""'Trembling"", 'Road', 'trailer', 'interviews', 'five', 'prominent', 'rabbis', 'featured', 'documentary', ""'re"", 'quite', 'Orthodox', 'also', 'seem', 'compassionate', 'open-minded', 'wanting', 'find', 'halachic', 'solution', 'issue', 'instead', 'just', 'telling', 'gay', 'people', 'live', 'celibate', 'lives', 'pretend', 'be', 'straight', 'deleted', 'scene', 'discussion', 'people', 'involved', 'Petach', 'Lev', 'Israeli', 'group', 'dealing', 'issues', 'footage', 'arcane', 'Medieval', 'ceremony', 'atone', 'sexual', 'sins', 'so', 'much', 'more']",N/A

My life is an ongoing struggle (not always successful) to maintain affective integrity and chastity while celibate. A struggle to be staunch.So I really identified with the all the people in this film. All of them are faith haunted. Their tradition prescribes- and proscribes- certain types of sexual behavior. Adhering to that ethic can be excruciating. Some reject it, yet others embrace it. The rebellion and embrace both fascinate and move me. Their struggles, revolts and submissions all put paid (in my febrile little mind, anyway) to the ridiculously rigid paradigm with which our dominant contemporary discourse tends to address sexuality and faith. It doesn't have to be either/or. In fact it never is.As one of them, a HIV positive Hasidic (?) kid, says near the end of the film [and I paraphrase from memory, using goyim lingo]: being sexual isn't a curse, it's a tenderness, a mercy from Hashem (God).

770788,AKHJVOYEX6QME,B0000BV1YO,"Colleen McMahon ""&#34;Omnivorous Reader&#34;""","[2, 2]","Trembling Before G-d is a documentary about the lives of gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews.  Orthodox Judaism believes in following all the laws of Torah (plus all the rabbinic interpretations laid out through the years) literally, including the ones about same sex relations being an abomination.  In addition, Orthodox and particularly Hassidic Jews grow up in a very insulated community where nearly all emphasis is on marrying and having children.  This leads to agony for those who cannot deny their essential selves but who cannot toss away their religious beliefs either.The documentary has a good spectrum of subjects, from the man who left all together (but still clearly has a wistful ambivalence about some of the traditional practices) to the man who seems to have made some peace with himself as a practicing Jewish gay man--until he returns to an old rabbinic mentor and is confronted again by the lack of acceptance.  I think my favorites were the two frum women in Florida, making their homey Shabbat preparations and counseling a friend who is a married and unhappy lesbian.  At one point a brief painfully polite phone call from one of the women's parents has a devastating effect, and I completely identified with her reaction, having been in much the same position.  Much of the movie moved me to tears but there were signs of hope in the shifting of viewpoints even among some of the rabbis who are the sources of counsel for future struggling youth.  I hope their voices gain strength and are heard.  Even among the most Orthodox, living a life that is a lie or god forbid, suicide, are greater sins and this is beginning to be recognized by some.Even if one is not Jewish but interested in gay and lesbian issues (or not gay/lesbian but interested in Jewish issues) this is a documentary well worth seeing.

770789,A4IL0CLL27Q33,B0000BV1YO,D. Brennan,"[3, 3]","There are two aspects of people - the clay and the spirit. At its heart, Trembling is about the tensions that arise when the spiritual side of humans (and the adherents of faith) and the clay that we are made of conflict.Can a gay person live a live of celibacy in order to not conflict with religious teachings? Can a gay person force him or herself to change so that a heterosexual marriage can work for them?Can a religion with thousands of years of tradition change to accommodate people who want to be more than casual, and not entirely welcome, participants?Can rabbis, people who care both about religion AND the Jewish people simply accept what they see as an immoral lifestyle because they want to see all people accepted into the larger community? What can be sacrificed for the sake if inclusiveness and what must remain intact for a religion to maintain its internal consistency?I would like to describe one incident in the film. A young gay Jewish man of deep faith asks a very respected rabbi what he should do in order to stop being gay. The answer is that he must listen to the spiritual side and ignore the physical and psychological needs of companionship.The man goes home and really tries to live the life of a good, heterosexual, Jew. The results were years of pain and loneliness. Ten years later the man returns and asks the Rabbi whether he must persevere. The rabbi said no - a shocking answer to all of us watching this film. The rabbi's reasoning goes to the crux of this issue - as a human he cannot tell another person that he must give up on happiness and companionship. This is a profound message. The rabbi does not condone or excuse homosexual behavior - his counseling now is less religions and more personal.I want to be clear that this documentary does not overtly press an agenda - it is not one long argument for changing Judiasm. It is simply about real people asking profound and very personal questions. It would have been easy to edit a few words here and there in this documentary to push an agenda. After all, we are all being bombarded constantly by news programs that are less about informing us and more about trying to push an agenda.

770791,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0000BV1YO,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","TREMBLING BEFORE G-D (Prod./Dir. Sandi DuBowski, 2001, 80 minutes, for PBS) is perhaps the most important gay documentary ever produced. Though it concentrates on the particular struggle of Orthodox Jews who are also gay, this film resonates far beyond the struggle within the Orthodox Jewish communities around the world. It speaks to every struggling religious gay person. No wonder it was six years in the making.Filmmaker Sandi DuBowski, a gay Jewish man from Brooklyn, originally started this film as a video diary sometime in the mid-1990s. Soon he decided he could go around finding other gay Jews to share stories. He mentions, for example, a very old Orthodox rabbi who confided in him that he hated his wife. The rabbi was gay, had ten children and countless grandchildren, and was gay all along, stuck in a miserable marriage.This suffering and the attitudes that produce it DuBowski calls ""Homophobia with a yarmulke on top.""While this has excellent coverage of the entire question, and DuBowski is a sensitive, competent narrator of the true stories herein, he was only able to find two people, gay and still Orthodox, who would appear on camera to tell their stories. Apparently everyone else he spoke to appeared in the several silhouetted action sequences. (Have no fear: there is nothing sordid or malapropos.)The stories that will touch us all again and again, of course, are the stories of religious gay Jews who are no longer Orthodox - and many of these were simply kicked out of their congregations. For a Jew, that means total banishment so they are kicked out of their families as well. DuBowski says asking gay people to ""stop being gay"" is like asking them to cut off an arm.The documentary makes the argument that gay Jews are being asked to stop being gay for the sake of their religion, hence the cutting off one arm for the sake of the other. That is true of all gay people! This documentary, unlike any other gay-themed documentary, makes me weep. A lot. And you will, too.This film literally caused a change in our society, not to mention Jewish society. Rabbis' eyes were opened to the question of homosexuality; the problems were suddenly ""put on the table"" as the director says. I recall the immediate impact of this film when it first aired, and I was astonished.

It doesn't try to tie up loose ends. It has respect for the religious tradition that has led to the dilemna that the gay individuals are experiencing. It simply uses the camera as an objective eye into the lives of people we might never get to know. The effect of this approach is that we are allowed to see on our own the tradition and the individuals. As a result, the humanity of everyone is preserved and the value of the tradition is preserved.

770797,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0000BV1YO,Lawyeraau,"[37, 38]","Winner of the Teddy Award of the 2001 Berlin Film festival and a 2001 Selection of the Sundance Film festival, this is a beautifully realized documentary  that is devoted to the stories of those who are gay and lesbian within the Jewish Orthodox and Hasidic communities. Their stories and their struggles break the viewer's heart.  It shows the lengths that people will go to try to reconcile their Jewish faith with its strictures regarding homosexuality and still remain a member of that religious community. Some of the stories are very sad, but all are, nonetheless, enlightening. People of all faiths should make it a point to see this film, because reconciliation of faith with one's sexual orientation is not limited to those who profess Judaism. It is a question with which Catholics, as well as those of other faiths, grapple.Masterfully directed by Sandi Simcha Dubowski, the film boasts a wonderful, joyous soundtrack by John Zorn that conjures up the biblical underpinnings and zest of the Jewish faith. The filming of people behind a white screen so that they appear as dark silhouettes against a light backdrop, at times, to show moments in the religious life of those of the Jewish faith is also striking and very powerful, as well as aesthetically pleasing. This was done because so many who participated in this film refused to appear on screen, so as to avoid ostracism within their respective communities. The final result is visually mesmerizing.It took the director six years to get enough people who dared to speak out on film about this issue. Some of them are out of the closet, but a number of them are not.  Some of them, mostly women, are, in fact, married to a member of the opposite sex, despite their sexual orientation, mostly quite unhappily. How terrible for all parties concerned, as none have been able to achieve  true communion with their spouses. Yet, many feel that living a lie is the only way to remain within their religious community, and for them this is preferable to ostracism from the only way of life they have ever known. Some have left their religious communities, but that, too, has been a road fraught with personal turmoil, as well as with emotional trauma and anguish. Others have stayed true to their natures, but still try to live a religious life, though they are no longer participating in the religious communities that have rejected them. Some have despaired and felt suicide to be their only alternative.Some of the advice given to homosexual men by their rabbis  so that these men may overcome their &quot;affliction&quot;, for that is how homosexuality is perceived by many in the Orthodox and Hasidic communities, is quite startling.  In the Jewish faith. strict construction of biblical texts  holds that certain types of sexual intercourse constitutes an abomination.  So, homosexual men are encouraged to marry women, despite their sexual orientation. Never mind that such men will also be unlikely to have a true communion with their wives. Yet, at the same time, many in these religious communities prefer that their daughters not marry such men. So there is some visceral, tacit acknowledgment that this is not a recipe for a good marriage. Behavior modification, aversion therapy, and psychotherapy are some of the other weapons the religious community uses to mount their campaign to correct one's sexual orientation. Some within these religious communities hold the antiquated belief that one's sexual orientation can be changed or sublimated.The film provides much food for thought, and the topic is one that has been previously considered to be taboo. The issue of homosexuality within religious communities is now one that is ripe for discussion. The director has managed to bring the issue to the forefront in a tasteful, yet thought provoking way.  The director is always mindful of the humanity of those whose stories he is telling. It is a humanity of which  those in these religious communities should also be mindful, as all are made in the image of God.This is a DVD worth having for those who are interested in different cultures or faiths within the construct of the issue that the film is exploring. It is a two disc, value laden DVD with crisp visuals and sound. Asides from the usual commentary and theatrical trailers, it has one disc entirely devoted to special features. It discusses the medieval rite of atonement for homosexual acts. It has an panel of prominent rabbis discussing their thoughts on the issues raised by the film. There is a special project in Israel that was established in the wake of this film and a number of panelists discuss their experiences with some of these issues. The director even has a featurette on his grandmother, who seems to be quite a character. All in all, this is a DVD worth having in one's personal collection.

Epstein ""asanisimasa""","[8, 8]","I saw this film when it was first released in cinemas and I thought it was good, perhaps warranting a 3 1/2 star rating.The DVD experience brings this film up to 5 stars because there is SO much added material that gives one a deeper and broader understanding of the complexities of religion.  Not just Judaism, I think every religion has as wide a spectrum of interpretation.  There's over 3 hours of extras on the second disc, and I especially thought that the added comments by Rabbi Steve Greenberg (the openly gay orthodox Rabbi) and several of the other orthodox Rabbis featured in the film were extremely important.  There is a pretty wide range of views and interpretations, which makes one realize just how cult-like orthodoxy can be in any religion if one is relying on just one particular religious leader for guidance.  Most of the gay people interviewed in the film who were really suffering over how to accept who they are and still be a 'good Jew' were people who talked to Rabbis who were inflexible on accepting homosexuals.  Five out of six of the rabbis interviewed on the second disc were able to understand that being gay is not a choice and therefore not a sin.  They were still conservative overall, but their reasoning was very sound and certainly not some wish on their part to reconcile homosexuality with Judaism.  The wonderful thing about Judaism is that the Torah is full of questioning and interpretation of God's laws.  It teaches us that we have to look at the circumstances of the people who are living outside the parameter of God's law and see if they are really betraying God's law, or if they are essentially good people who are doing the best they can under the given circumstances.The DVD also has a great 35-minute follow-up documentary on the effect this film has had around the world (and some terrific Klezmer music in the end credits!), and there are lots of other odds and ends that are entertaining and/or interesting.

Is there room for them in their own religion?No single point of view is proffered as the correct one; instead each person's particular difficulties are laid out for our consideration.  Some remain sympathetic to their faith; some have all but abandoned it.As a former fundamentalist Christian, I identified with the inner struggle these people endured - the sometimes awful tension between what one has been raised to believe and what one's heart has come to intrinsically feel. And having known a few gays within fundamentalism, too, I have to wonder, how do they stay?

Berg ""Rob""","[4, 4]","I could not sit idly by and not address the review that stated that, in order to be an Orthodox Jew, one must follow every word of the Torah to the letter. In fact, that attitude shows a misunderstanding of the very basic concepts of Judaism.Rather than paraphrase, I am just going to quote from the OrthoGays website, an on-line community of Gay Orthodox Jews: ""Just because a Jew cannot observe every mitzvah does not mean he should not do any and does not mean that he cannot live within a framework of traditional Judaism. All Jews have shortcomings: 'for there is no person so wholly righteous on earth that he [always] does good and never sins' (Kohelet 7:20)."" In other words, the Bible, which, by the way, only speaks out against anal intercourse, not any other form of homosexual feelings or behavior, may consider a certain aspect of homosexuality a sin, but by honoring and observing all other laws, one can still be a Jew. The site goes on to say that if one transgresses in any way, ""instead of breaking away from G-d, one can come closer to G-d by doing other mitzvos. G-d is always with us. When a person falls, he falls into the lap of G-d...We are as beloved in the eyes of G-d as any other Jew and we are as responsible as any other Jew in observing the mitzvos. We will merit the same share in the world to come as all other Jews, as it is written 'Kol Yisrael yesh la-hem chelek l'olam ha-bah' ('All Israel has a share in the world to come' Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:1).""",5,A reaction to Mr. Lipokowitz's review,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,1486,"['could', 'not', 'sit', 'idly', 'not', 'address', 'review', 'stated', 'order', 'be', 'Orthodox', 'Jew', 'one', 'must', 'follow', 'word', 'Torah', 'letter', 'fact', 'attitude', 'misunderstanding', 'very', 'basic', 'concepts', 'Judaism.Rather', 'paraphrase', 'am', 'just', 'going', 'quote', 'OrthoGays', 'website', 'on-line', 'community', 'Gay', 'Orthodox', 'Jews', 'Just', 'Jew', 'can', 'not', 'observe', 'mitzvah', 'not', 'mean', 'should', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'framework', 'traditional', 'Judaism', 'Jews', 'have', 'shortcomings', ""'for"", 'person', 'so', 'wholly', 'righteous', 'earth', 'always', ']', 'good', 'never', 'sins', 'Kohelet', '7:20', 'other', 'words', 'Bible', 'way', 'only', 'out', 'anal', 'intercourse', 'not', 'other', 'form', 'homosexual', 'feelings', 'behavior', 'may', 'consider', 'certain', 'aspect', 'homosexuality', 'sin', 'honoring', 'observing', 'other', 'laws', 'one', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'Jew', 'site', 'say', 'one', 'transgresses', 'way', 'instead', 'breaking', 'away', 'G-d', 'one', 'can', 'come', 'closer', 'G-d', 'doing', 'other', 'mitzvos', 'G-d', 'always', 'When', 'person', 'lap', 'G-d', 'are', 'beloved', 'eyes', 'G-d', 'other', 'Jew', 'are', 'as', 'responsible', 'other', 'Jew', 'observing', 'mitzvos', 'will', 'merit', 'same', 'share', 'world', 'come', 'other', 'Jews', 'written', ""'Kol"", 'Yisrael', 'yesh', 'la-hem', 'chelek', ""l'olam"", 'ha-bah', 'Israel', 'share', 'world', 'come', 'Mishnah', 'Sanhedrin', '10:1']",N/A
