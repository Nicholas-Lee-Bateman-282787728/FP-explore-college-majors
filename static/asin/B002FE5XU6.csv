To only those of you who hold well and truly that all important moments of life has a Python quote at the ready.  If you have never been told to ""Shut Up"", you will have only the four star edition of this review.  The rest will be bored to tears.We are at home as soon as the familiar 17"" diagonal TV is exploded.  An unfamiliar face fills our screen, but he is just a lawyer, hence the overflight of the Soviet TU-85 dropping a bomb with parachute.  Incongruity follows reassuringly, with the atomic detonation on Bikini Atoll.  This is the Lawyers' Cut and it cuts both ways.  Film is cut and they take their pound of flesh. But this is old business in Python history.  All will be made clear.These short six hours are for us lifers.  There is a bonus disk above what was aired, which has a starter sample of the popular skits.  You can show those to other people.  For us, we get the extended interviews with each of them; and you get to see how these interviews were scripted.  It is instructive to see each and understand how the editing was done into the prior scenes.You get to know that Cleese's name was originally Cheese, changed by his father.  Freud would clap at and for the later skit.  More importantly, we see the influence of 'The Goon Show"", and ""Beyond the Fringe"" for all of the nascent pythons.What struck me, at this advanced age, is their most important point for them and for the society.  Python rode the crest of the wave destroying the deferential British Society.  They grew up at end of empire.  Their families were still hoping for some small facsimile. Python was a great part of the democratic engine that has seen the recovery and the rise of the new Britain.  The dream caught fire in America shortly after.So they progress through television, into records, and lavish time spent on their films.  Who knew that Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd bankrolled their Holy Grail?  And George Harrison did the same for Life of Brian.  We learn how the films of Pasolini's realism and Bunuel's sur-realism affected theirs.  And best of all unknown supporters, Elvis.I am happy to say, though too short, they did it right.",5,"For the Faithful, the Obsessed and our last best hope",1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,2283,"['Warning', 'five', 'stars', 'hold', 'true', 'only', 'annoy', 'other', 'people', 'grasp', 'Python', 'quote', 'length', 'opportunity', 'only', 'who', 'hold', 'well', 'truly', 'important', 'moments', 'life', 'Python', 'quote', 'ready', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'told', 'Shut', 'Up', 'will', 'have', 'only', 'four', 'star', 'edition', 'review', 'rest', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'tears.We', 'are', 'home', 'as', 'soon', 'familiar', '17', 'diagonal', 'TV', 'exploded', 'unfamiliar', 'face', 'screen', 'just', 'lawyer', 'hence', 'overflight', 'Soviet', 'TU-85', 'dropping', 'bomb', 'parachute', 'Incongruity', 'reassuringly', 'atomic', 'detonation', 'Bikini', 'Atoll', 'Lawyers', 'Cut', 'ways', 'Film', 'cut', 'take', 'pound', 'flesh', 'old', 'business', 'Python', 'history', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'clear.These', 'short', 'six', 'hours', 'are', 'lifers', 'bonus', 'disk', 'what', 'was', 'aired', 'starter', 'sample', 'popular', 'skits', 'can', 'show', 'other', 'people', 'get', 'extended', 'interviews', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'interviews', 'were', 'scripted', 'instructive', 'see', 'understand', 'how', 'editing', 'was', 'done', 'prior', 'scenes.You', 'get', 'know', 'Cleese', 'name', 'was', 'originally', 'Cheese', 'changed', 'father', 'Freud', 'would', 'clap', 'later', 'skit', 'More', 'importantly', 'see', 'influence', ""'The"", 'Goon', 'Show', 'Fringe', 'nascent', 'pythons.What', 'struck', 'advanced', 'age', 'most', 'important', 'point', 'society', 'Python', 'rode', 'crest', 'wave', 'destroying', 'deferential', 'British', 'Society', 'grew', 'up', 'end', 'empire', 'families', 'were', 'still', 'hoping', 'small', 'facsimile', 'Python', 'was', 'great', 'part', 'democratic', 'engine', 'seen', 'recovery', 'rise', 'new', 'Britain', 'dream', 'caught', 'fire', 'America', 'shortly', 'progress', 'television', 'records', 'lavish', 'time', 'spent', 'films', 'Who', 'knew', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'bankrolled', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'George', 'Harrison', 'did', 'same', 'Life', 'Brian', 'learn', 'how', 'films', 'Pasolini', 'realism', 'Bunuel', 'sur-realism', 'affected', 'theirs', 'best', 'unknown', 'supporters', 'Elvis.I', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'though', 'too', 'short', 'did', 'right']",N/A

Guinness,"[3, 3]","Monty Python's reputation as groundbreaking sketch comedy is well-known, yet they have this strange habit of reminding us every five years or so with an ""anniversary special"".  This might be all right if the team were still functioning, but the truth is Monty Python has been stone dead since 1983.So WHY in heaven's name must we sit through the same story again, especially if they've already given us FOUR previous talk-fests, The Pythons (1979), Life of Python (1989), Live At Aspen (1998), It's...The Monty Python Story (1999), and at least two books, The Pythons Autobiography (2003) and Monty Python Live (2009)?The answer is simple: Monty Python: Almost The Truth is the best retrospective yet.What distinguishes this set from the others is how the Python phenomenon is put in perspective by such contemporary fans as Russell Brand, Sanjeev Bhaskar, and, closer to home, Dan Aykroyd and Seth Green, amongst many others.Be advised that this is basically an 8-hour dissection of the creative process in comedy, how Python's TV shows, records, and films (Oddly they chose not to talk about their spin-off books and computer games) were made and influenced so many current comedians.  Bhaskar and Brand's comments are especially insightful and smart and every bit as entertaining as Cleese, Gilliam, Idle, Jones, Palin, and (in archival interview footage) Chapman themselves.  IF that interests you, you'll be fascinated no end by this.  The balance of interviews and clips of sketches and scenes is quite good (the Life of Brian ones are especially uproarious and welcome) and there's even a bonus disc of the greatest hits from Monty Python's Flying Circus (Silly Walks, Parrot Sketch, etc.) which is perfect if you just need a quick fix of undiluted Python.If in fact this is Python's final word on Python (personally I doubt it) it's well worth owning for hardcore fans.  As a fan, humourist, and student of comedy myself, I'd go so far as to say it's the only essential Monty Python DVD, this and the Holy Grail, of course!

Lots of good anecdotes, end notes, and even litotes. Clearly this is an Idle production; he is happily shameless about milking them now, and I suppose we should be grateful.Somehow though, I have the vague suspicion that the more one learns about ""how we made the Magic forty years ago"", whichever group or artist etc is doing the telling, the more a corresponding fading of the magic might occur.

They are all very intelligent & could have gone on to any ""respectful"" field they chose, but they chose to be silly, and God Bless them for that. Episode 1 goes thru their childhoods, up until they formed together. 2 Is a highly informative look at making the show and the shows legacy. 3 is the sordid personal bits where they describe what they think of the other python's. 4 is all about the making and release of Holy Grail, & likewise 5 is about life of Brian, which features a great talk show clip where Palin & Cleese defend their movie against a bishop and priest respectively. Episode 6 is the wrap up why they broke up, why they won't get back together, and what they learned (if anything) and what they are doing now. there are some good extras, extended interviews, and several of their best sketches (yes the Parrot one is included).

1266114,A33775AIB1A664,B002FE5XU6,"Mark Colan ""duke-of-url""","[5, 6]","FIRST TWO DVDs: THE DOCUMENTARYThis DVD set has six episodes on two DVDs, a bit under an hour each, that serve as a documentary on Monty Python.  It starts well before they formed the group and discusses the early work the members did, some biographical background, and what influenced them to become humorists.  From there, there are five more episodes that take us through their entire career.There are bits of some of their funnier moments interspersed with more serious discussion.  Obviously, you should approach these discs as deepening your understanding and appreciation for who the members were, and how their TV program and their movies came to be, rather than the non-stop entertainment you get in the TV programs and movies themselves.As a semi-serious fan, I found it fascinating.  One standout was John Cleese discussing how the ideas for the Cheese Shop came about.  You can find everything he said, and more, in a wikipedia article called ""The Cheese Shop"", but it means more to hear him talk about it.  The most important thing I learned was the importance of Graham Chapman, and why the group thought they could not be MP without him after he died.  I have a much greater appreciation for what he did for the group.  In fact, that is true for all of them.  While John Cleese is perhaps a standout in the group for many people, MP could not have been MP without the contributions of each of its six members.A lot of time is given to having each member discuss aspects of their history and development, and it is totally worthwhile, even though they are all older now and are looking back many years.  For Graham Chapman, they used a lot of an early-80s interview he had done, along with people who knew him really well, interviewed in recent years.THE THIRD DVD: NON-ESSENTIALThe third DVD can be thought of in two parts.  One part is a gathering of highlights of each member's interview, all extracted from the documentaries on the first two discs.  It also includes full-length sketches for the excerpts shown on the first two discs.  The rest is various outtakes, which range from vaguely interesting to, well, you can see why it was not included.As such, the third DVD adds little to the package; if you were to get the six documentary episodes, you would have 99% of the value.BOTTOM LINEFour stars means ""I Like It"".  I am really glad to have seen it once, but I am not sure I need to watch it again.

The hype is pythonesque; this is actually a formal documentary featuring recent interviews with the members of the troupe, except, of course, for Graham Chapman, who is featured in earlier interviews.  It is a series of frank reflections on their productions, with intercut examples and commentary from a series of individuals from the (very broadly-defined) world of comedy.  The focus is on the interviews.  The pythons talk about one another's personalities and work habits and about the group dynamics that fed or deterred their creative process.  The degree of Graham Chapman's alcoholism, e.g., is discussed at length.  Cleese talks about his desire to leave the show when it became, in his opinion, repetitious.  Palin wins the award for Mr. Congeniality . . . and so forth.The 6 hours move very briskly.  We watched 3 hours at the first 'seating' and the time went swiftly.

1266118,A16QODENBJVUI1,B002FE5XU6,Robert Moore,"[3, 4]","As they are intent to point out, this is an overview of the career of Monty Python's Flying Circus from the point of view of the five surviving members of the team. The various members are interviewed separately (except for some bits from an interview of Terry Jones and Michael Palin as they take a train to Aardman Animations, Nick Park's studio). Together they tell the story of the team from their individual childhood's to the present.If you love all things Python, this is a great way to work through their career from the first episodes of MONTY PYTHON until the present, with their explanation of why there will be no new Monty Python projects featuring the final five. I learned a lot of new things about them and loved hearing them all talk about their various joint projects. For instance, I was not aware that John Cleese originally wanted to play Brian in LIFE OF BRIAN, but was talked out of it by the other members.My only two complaints about the set are that many of the interviews with non-Pythons were sometimes not terribly illuminating. Did we really need any contributions from Russell Brand (he remains a mystery to me - the next interesting thing that I hear coming from his mouth will be the first interesting thing I hear coming from his mouth)? My other complaint comes from the set. There were not very many interesting special features. We do get extended interviews and several of their most famous clips from the show. I saw this on Blu-ray and I was mildly disappointed with the visual quality of the clips (thought definitely not the documentary). If the transfers are not any better than this, then I will certainly not be getting MONTY PYTHON on Blu-ray when that comes out. Hopefully they did not do their best work on the transfers. I remain hopeful that they can do new transfers that would justify doing Blu-ray editions. That aside, let me point out what a huge week it was for Blu-ray. There were three major new Blu-ray releases that drew my attention: this set, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA: THE PLAN, and THE PRISONER. All three were simply outstanding releases.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[87, 93]","Forty Years ago five ""silly"" (but educated - Oxford and Cambridge) British comic actors joined with one American animators to for what is collectively known as Monty Python's Flying Circus. After the BBC ran a pilot and it worked they got a contract and produced 39 half-hour-long shows. Yes, there were only 39. Of course, the team later made some feature films before disbanding.This documentary, shown originally in October 2009 on the Independent Film Channel on cable, runs six hours! There also bonus material. This is a serious documentary on comedy. The five living members (Graham Chapman, deceased, is showing with early interview clips) each provide comments on their beginning, career as part of the team and life after Python. None of these members are interviewed together. Though they don't trash one another, you get the feeling, after a while, that they had fun when they were doing it but saw it as a job and its past history. They have gone on to other ventures. Their interviews are not funny. But there are plenty of clips from the show and the films inserted that ARE funny - often hilarious. Most of these are not shown in their entirety. That's because the director of this film wanted to spend more time interviewing current comedians, most of who the average American has not hear of. And some have real egos.The first few episodes are devoted to the original show. Later ones are devoted to specific films (""Life of Brian"", ""The Holy Grail"").So, if you truly love the Pythons, and have about eight hours to spend time with them as they tell you about their lives, this is a set you will want. If you are looking for laughs of the continuous type you might be better off revisiting one of the classic films or getting the DVD sets of full episodes. Its great that someone took the time to put this together - and that the 5 living members cooperated - but the enjoyment will come from whether you can recite the ""Dead Parrot"" routine by heart, and whether you really want to know the story of how it was created.By the way, I noted two previous reviews that gave the DVD five stars when neither person has seen the film, and one of those was only asking a question.
