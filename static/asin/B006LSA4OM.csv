I'm thrilled that Emilio Estevez went forward with this program, really against all odds.  Not the type of movie that Hollywood likes.

1517234,A254JU5MYX496C,B006LSA4OM,Boatman,"[0, 0]",~Started watching this on my Blue-Ray but found I could not reverse or speed forward. It just stops the movie. I notice that many commented how difficult it was to read the white-letter captions when foreign [ non-English ] words were being spoken but I did not find this to be a problem at all. It would have been nice to have closed captions for the English as well because of the pronunciation of the Spanish words.The main problem I had was the issue of having to watch the entire movie without being able to reverse or speed forward.I  will try it on my DVD player [ when I have access to it ] to see if the functions work better on a different device. This is the only reason it did not get five [5] stars. Otherwise.....Way to go Amazing-zon!!!~,4,Great Movie Before You Go,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,752,"['~Started', 'watching', 'Blue-Ray', 'found', 'could', 'not', 'reverse', 'speed', 'forward', 'just', 'movie', 'notice', 'many', 'commented', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'read', 'white-letter', 'captions', 'when', 'foreign', '[', 'non-English', ']', 'words', 'were', 'being', 'spoken', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'be', 'problem', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'closed', 'captions', 'English', 'as', 'well', 'pronunciation', 'Spanish', 'words.The', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'issue', 'having', 'watch', 'entire', 'movie', 'being', 'able', 'reverse', 'speed', 'forward.I', 'will', 'try', 'DVD', 'player', '[', 'when', 'have', 'access', ']', 'see', 'functions', 'work', 'better', 'different', 'device', 'only', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'five', '[', '5', ']', 'stars', 'Otherwise', '..Way', 'go', 'Amazing-zon', '~']",The Way of Saint James

Before I travel I love to read and research as much material as I can to make the trips come to life.

What idiot puts white subtitles on a white background?  Impossible to read and that always drives me crazy.  So many people speaking in Spanish throughout with subtitles and if one cannot read what is being said, well it is a washout.  Scenery is gorgeous and the people seem to be spiritually changed by the trip.  Whoever put in the subtitles ruined this altogether.",3,Subtitles are a disaster,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,503,"['Looked', 'forward', 'watching', 'Way', 'St.', 'James', 'inspirational', 'moments', 'downside', 'subtitles', 'What', 'idiot', 'white', 'subtitles', 'white', 'background', 'Impossible', 'read', 'always', 'crazy', 'So', 'many', 'people', 'speaking', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'read', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'well', 'washout', 'Scenery', 'gorgeous', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'spiritually', 'changed', 'trip', 'put', 'subtitles', 'ruined', 'altogether']",The Way of Saint James
