Cathey ""ParsifalCSA""","[13, 13]","This Timeless Media Group release (January, 2013) of CAST A LONG SHADOW arrived this weekend, and, although I haven't had the time to watch the entire film yet, I did perform a spot check, and from what I see the quality is fine. Timeless have licensed this lesser-known Murphy oater from Twentieth-Century Fox and MGM. United Artists (now part of MGM) originally released the film in 1959.Among some Western writers and biographers of Audie Murphy this film is often overlooked and criticized, but I believe they underrate the film. Certainly, Audie Murphy's Westerns with Universal-International, including NO NAME ON THE BULLET, SEVEN WAYS FROM SUNDOWN, and RIDE CLEAR OF DIABLO, are better films, shot in Technicolor and with high production values.  But Murphy is never less than solid and believable in this one. Additionally, he gets able co-starring cast support from John Dehner, James Best, and Denver Pyle. The Mirisch Company produced the film, and, unlike what some film guides indicate, it was shot in black and white (faithfully reproduced here). The veteran Thomas Carr directed.Lastly, the price is right--one cannot argue with that. Murphy fans should not hesitate to snatch this one up.",5,"Solid, underrated Murphy oater",1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,1205,"['Timeless', 'Media', 'Group', 'release', 'January', '2013', 'CAST', 'A', 'LONG', 'SHADOW', 'arrived', 'weekend', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'time', 'watch', 'entire', 'film', 'yet', 'did', 'perform', 'spot', 'check', 'what', 'see', 'quality', 'fine', 'Timeless', 'have', 'licensed', 'lesser-known', 'Murphy', 'oater', 'Twentieth-Century', 'Fox', 'MGM', 'United', 'Artists', 'now', 'part', 'MGM', 'originally', 'released', 'film', '1959.Among', 'Western', 'writers', 'biographers', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'film', 'often', 'overlooked', 'criticized', 'believe', 'underrate', 'film', 'Certainly', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'Westerns', 'Universal-International', 'including', 'NO', 'NAME', 'ON', 'THE', 'BULLET', 'SEVEN', 'WAYS', 'FROM', 'SUNDOWN', 'RIDE', 'CLEAR', 'OF', 'DIABLO', 'are', 'better', 'films', 'shot', 'Technicolor', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'Murphy', 'never', 'less', 'solid', 'believable', 'one', 'Additionally', 'able', 'co-starring', 'cast', 'support', 'John', 'Dehner', 'James', 'Best', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'Mirisch', 'Company', 'produced', 'film', 'what', 'film', 'guides', 'indicate', 'was', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'faithfully', 'reproduced', 'here', 'veteran', 'Thomas', 'Carr', 'directed.Lastly', 'price', 'right', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'argue', 'Murphy', 'fans', 'should', 'not', 'hesitate', 'snatch', 'one', 'up']",Cast A Long Shadow

Grew up with his movies and while not the best actor ever, always seemed to put forth a good effort and provided an appealing character. And that holds true in this picture as well. A man on a mission, pushing those with him to their limit on a cattle drive (hence my reference to Howard Hawks' Red River). It's in black and white, which I can live with. Many good westerns were in black and white, the aforementioned Red River, High Noon, and 3:10 to Yuma to mention just a few. But the conclusion of this film happens in about two minutes and doesn't live up to the care taken to tell the story to that point. Two of the four bad guys shoot each other, while the other two just ride away, and Audie's character saves his father from a cattle stampede, this father with whom he was in a physical altercation with just moments before as a result of learning that this individual was, in fact, his father, right before the stampede began. We then cut to Audie and his herd arriving in Santa Fe, his attitude much improved, having arrived in time to pay off the bank note on the ranch, and presumably resolving lingering issues with his father, THE END. The wrap up of the movie just seemed like some meat had been cut out of it. Otherwise, it was an entertaining and even interesting film up to that point.",3,Red River lite......,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,1331,"['am', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'fan', 'Grew', 'up', 'movies', 'not', 'best', 'actor', 'ever', 'always', 'seemed', 'put', 'forth', 'good', 'effort', 'provided', 'appealing', 'character', 'true', 'picture', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'mission', 'pushing', 'limit', 'cattle', 'drive', 'hence', 'reference', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Red', 'River', 'black', 'white', 'can', 'live', 'Many', 'good', 'westerns', 'were', 'black', 'white', 'aforementioned', 'Red', 'River', 'High', 'Noon', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'mention', 'just', 'few', 'conclusion', 'film', 'two', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'care', 'taken', 'tell', 'story', 'point', 'Two', 'four', 'bad', 'guys', 'shoot', 'other', 'other', 'two', 'just', 'ride', 'away', 'Audie', 'character', 'father', 'cattle', 'stampede', 'father', 'whom', 'was', 'physical', 'altercation', 'just', 'moments', 'result', 'learning', 'individual', 'was', 'fact', 'father', 'right', 'stampede', 'began', 'then', 'cut', 'Audie', 'herd', 'arriving', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'attitude', 'much', 'improved', 'having', 'arrived', 'time', 'pay', 'off', 'bank', 'note', 'ranch', 'presumably', 'resolving', 'lingering', 'issues', 'father', 'END', 'wrap', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', 'meat', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'entertaining', 'even', 'interesting', 'film', 'up', 'point']",Cast A Long Shadow
