370377,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6303354912,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 5]","Fresh is one of those movies that you never see coming.  From the opening credits until the end, it provides you with this deep, gritty, yet utterly realistic portrayal of a youth's mind on the streets.  While our normal society will shrug a struggling African American living in the ghetto as someone without the intelligence to go forward in life.  It is a sad reality in which we live, but it is a thought that goes through suburbia's minds.  This film proves the age-old saying that you should never judge a book by its cover.  What begins as a normal urban drama quickly unfolds into this tightly woven crime story where we have this unexpected hero that arrives from nowhere to pull of this incredible feat.  With perfect acting, the right combination of drama and action coupled with suspense, and a story that literally keeps you glued to your seat until the very end, it surprises me that more people haven't discovered this cinematic gem and attached themselves to it.To begin, Sean Nelson is brilliant.  I have not seen better acting from a young adult in my entire film life.  Dakota Fanning comes close, but Nelson's emotion seems to be raw and uncreated by Hollywood.  His reactions and passion behind his eyes is intense and compelling at the same time.  You cannot watch this movie without keeping your eyes glued to this kid.  I am very surprised that he has not done more roles that would be able to showcase this young prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s talent.  He interacts well with the other actors as well, giving us this rare glimpse into a world that many of us may not be familiar with.  He takes us away from the clich&eacute;d child abandoned on the streets with nothing to loose and gives us faith in the family structure and bonds that are created between humans.  Sometimes I think we forget this as we watch our televisions, buy our cars, and spend our money.  There are important aspects in life, but at times our ideas of that can be skewed.  That is what I love about Sean's role in this film.  He defines himself early, and allows us to see his change clearly throughout the film.  He begins as wanting to have a lot of money and power to using what he has earned to save his family and his friends.  There is something redeemable about that which isn't shown as much in films today.Add to the brilliant work of Sean Nelson are a couple of actors that really played well of the emotional child. Giancarlo Esposito, N'Bushe Wright, Jean-Claude La Marre, Ron Brice, and the unquenchable Sam Jackson are just a few.  Nelson's ability to play off Jackson's intensity with the greatest of ease is just another glowing example of the power behind this film.  You can honestly see where Fresh's talent began with the strong father/son dynamic that director Boaz Yakin has created.  Yakin has crafted this beautiful story of a child's inner demons and desires with the greatest of ease.  As a director, he has pulled more emotion out of these children than I have ever seen with any other child actors.  Where he takes his story is bold and realistic.  The dirtiness and grime of the streets contrasted with the intelligence of this child was nerve racking and intense.  I loved it.  Yakin had to be proud of himself to find such a great cast to work with as well as create this story that could be enjoyed by audience throughout the ages.Finally, I would like to comment on one of the most important themes of this film that I didn't realize until closer to the end.  Chess is a huge element in this film, and at first you will not see this, but by the end it will hit you like a brick.  The power that Jackson brings to this young boy's mind simply by teaching him the strategies of chess is insurmountable.  While I thought that Yakin was just trying to define the father/son relationship with this game, there was so much more going on underneath the top layer that I wasn't expecting it from this small title.  I think that is what impressed me so much.Overall, this film is great.  It is boldly honest and originally beautiful (in repetition of myself) that needs to be re-released or remembered time after time.  I am so glad that I discovered it and cannot wait to show it to friends and family.  It is nothing short of the perfect film!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,Your queen is just a pawn with some fancy moves...,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,4288,"['Fresh', 'one', 'movies', 'never', 'see', 'coming', 'opening', 'credits', 'end', 'deep', 'gritty', 'yet', 'utterly', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'youth', 'mind', 'streets', 'normal', 'society', 'will', 'shrug', 'struggling', 'African', 'American', 'living', 'ghetto', 'someone', 'intelligence', 'go', 'forward', 'life', 'sad', 'reality', 'live', 'thought', 'suburbia', 'minds', 'film', 'age-old', 'saying', 'should', 'never', 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'What', 'normal', 'urban', 'drama', 'quickly', 'tightly', 'woven', 'crime', 'story', 'where', 'have', 'unexpected', 'hero', 'nowhere', 'pull', 'incredible', 'feat', 'perfect', 'acting', 'right', 'combination', 'drama', 'action', 'coupled', 'suspense', 'story', 'literally', 'glued', 'seat', 'very', 'end', 'more', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'discovered', 'cinematic', 'gem', 'attached', 'it.To', 'begin', 'Sean', 'Nelson', 'brilliant', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'better', 'acting', 'young', 'adult', 'entire', 'film', 'life', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'close', 'Nelson', 'emotion', 'be', 'raw', 'uncreated', 'Hollywood', 'reactions', 'passion', 'eyes', 'intense', 'compelling', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'keeping', 'eyes', 'glued', 'kid', 'am', 'very', 'surprised', 'not', 'done', 'more', 'roles', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'showcase', 'young', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'talent', 'well', 'other', 'actors', 'well', 'giving', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'world', 'many', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'away', 'clich', 'eacute', 'child', 'abandoned', 'streets', 'nothing', 'loose', 'faith', 'family', 'structure', 'bonds', 'are', 'created', 'humans', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'forget', 'watch', 'televisions', 'buy', 'cars', 'spend', 'money', 'are', 'important', 'aspects', 'life', 'times', 'ideas', 'can', 'be', 'skewed', 'what', 'love', 'Sean', 'role', 'film', 'early', 'see', 'change', 'clearly', 'film', 'wanting', 'have', 'lot', 'money', 'power', 'using', 'what', 'earned', 'save', 'family', 'friends', 'something', 'redeemable', ""n't"", 'shown', 'as', 'much', 'films', 'today.Add', 'brilliant', 'work', 'Sean', 'Nelson', 'are', 'couple', 'actors', 'really', 'played', 'well', 'emotional', 'child', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', ""N'Bushe"", 'Wright', 'Jean-Claude', 'La', 'Marre', 'Ron', 'Brice', 'unquenchable', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'Nelson', 'ability', 'play', 'off', 'Jackson', 'intensity', 'greatest', 'ease', 'just', 'glowing', 'example', 'power', 'film', 'can', 'honestly', 'see', 'where', 'Fresh', 'talent', 'began', 'strong', 'father/son', 'dynamic', 'director', 'Boaz', 'Yakin', 'created', 'Yakin', 'crafted', 'beautiful', 'story', 'child', 'inner', 'demons', 'desires', 'greatest', 'ease', 'director', 'pulled', 'more', 'emotion', 'children', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'other', 'child', 'actors', 'Where', 'story', 'bold', 'realistic', 'dirtiness', 'grime', 'streets', 'contrasted', 'intelligence', 'child', 'was', 'nerve', 'racking', 'intense', 'loved', 'Yakin', 'had', 'be', 'proud', 'find', 'such', 'great', 'cast', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'create', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'audience', 'ages.Finally', 'would', 'like', 'comment', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'themes', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'closer', 'end', 'Chess', 'huge', 'element', 'film', 'first', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'end', 'will', 'hit', 'brick', 'power', 'Jackson', 'young', 'boy', 'mind', 'simply', 'teaching', 'strategies', 'chess', 'insurmountable', 'thought', 'Yakin', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'define', 'father/son', 'relationship', 'game', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'going', 'top', 'layer', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'small', 'title', 'think', 'what', 'impressed', 'much.Overall', 'film', 'great', 'boldly', 'honest', 'originally', 'beautiful', 'repetition', 'be', 're-released', 'remembered', 'time', 'time', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'discovered', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'show', 'friends', 'family', 'nothing', 'short', 'perfect', 'film', 'Grade', '*****', '*****']",Fresh VHS
370378,AF1VHA7BVWLO1,6303354912,Alexia Komaux,"[5, 7]","There are no fancy cinematic magic tricks going on in this film, aside from an instance of superimposed images that is so simple it almost seems like a throwback to old silent dramas. There are no choreographed gun fights, no switching film stocks to produce psychedelic effects, nothing like that. Not to say that these things cannot be used appropriately and judiciously to enhance the effect of a particular film, but ""Fresh"" is stripped bare, and must depend on its performances, direction, and writing alone.For starters, a young Sean Nelson delivers a performance that puts the lion's share of veteran actors to shame. He's completely lacking in self-consciousness, almost like he's unaware that the camera is on him for nine out of ten of the shots in ""Fresh."" His character, for which the film takes its title, may be the smartest youth in motion picture history for whom genius is not a gimmick or a joke (i.e. ""Good Will Hunting,"" ""Real Genius,"" stuff like that). Watching him, you see a wise old actor in a teen's body; he does not ""act"" any emotions or thoughts, but merely feels them and thinks them. He seems to embody bits of screen legend: a little Bogart stalwartness there, some of Jimmy Stewart's quiet charm here, and most of all Morgan Freeman's ability to communicate much while doing or saying very little.That'd be just enough for most movies, but Nelson is backed by a choice supporting cast: the two most recognizable names are obviously Samuel L. Jackson (Fresh's chessmaster/alcoholic father) and Giancarlo Esposito (the slimy, high-living drug dealer Esteban), and both are perfect in award-caliber performances. Two lesser known actors, N'Bushe Wright (Fresh's junkie sister Nichole) and Jean LaMare (as Jake, the hot tempered low-man-on-the-totem-pole employee of Corky) are also terrific in key roles.The screenplay, by director Boaz Yakin, is doggedly unpredictable, but in retrospect it all makes perfect sense -- nothing in the movie pushes the bounds of credibility. I've seen truckloads of thrillers, most of them are wearily proficient at making you guess what's next. None but a few, however, kept me guessing WHEN to guess, or surprised me with such affecting emotional developments. None but a few moved along with such self-assured grace and style. ""Fresh"" knows its territory, the time and place it's set in, and it provides characters who talk like they do in real life -- not ones that sound like they're in a movie where they talk like they do in real life.The use of violence is admirably restrained. Most of it takes place off camera, silhouetted, or cut away from quickly. The two scenes of bloodletting, when they are shown to us, are literally heartbreaking. Not only does ""Fresh"" keep us off guard on a psychological level, but on an emotional one as well, something few films ever think of doing.If I were to offer one criticism, it would be that the chess metaphor was pressed just a bit too hard by Yakin (though the final scene is devastating): we already know that this kid is thinking like a master strategist, we don't need quite so many shots of him playing the game in his room. That's a small quibble, though, because the chess metaphor is entirely appropriate, and Jackson's early speech about the game is an ingenious device.",5,Like a kick in the stomach,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,3289,"['are', 'fancy', 'cinematic', 'magic', 'tricks', 'going', 'film', 'aside', 'instance', 'superimposed', 'images', 'so', 'simple', 'almost', 'throwback', 'old', 'silent', 'dramas', 'are', 'choreographed', 'gun', 'fights', 'switching', 'film', 'stocks', 'produce', 'psychedelic', 'effects', 'nothing', 'Not', 'say', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'appropriately', 'judiciously', 'enhance', 'effect', 'particular', 'film', 'Fresh', 'stripped', 'bare', 'must', 'depend', 'performances', 'direction', 'writing', 'alone.For', 'starters', 'young', 'Sean', 'Nelson', 'performance', 'lion', 'share', 'veteran', 'actors', 'shame', 'completely', 'lacking', 'self-consciousness', 'almost', 'unaware', 'camera', 'nine', 'ten', 'shots', 'Fresh', 'character', 'film', 'title', 'may', 'be', 'smartest', 'youth', 'motion', 'picture', 'history', 'whom', 'genius', 'not', 'gimmick', 'joke', 'i.e', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Real', 'Genius', 'stuff', 'Watching', 'see', 'wise', 'old', 'actor', 'teen', 'body', 'not', 'act', 'emotions', 'thoughts', 'merely', 'thinks', 'embody', 'bits', 'screen', 'legend', 'little', 'Bogart', 'stalwartness', 'there', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'quiet', 'charm', 'here', 'most', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'ability', 'communicate', 'much', 'doing', 'saying', 'very', 'little.That', ""'d"", 'be', 'just', 'enough', 'most', 'movies', 'Nelson', 'backed', 'choice', 'supporting', 'cast', 'two', 'most', 'recognizable', 'names', 'are', 'obviously', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Fresh', 'chessmaster/alcoholic', 'father', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'slimy', 'high-living', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Esteban', 'are', 'perfect', 'award-caliber', 'performances', 'Two', 'lesser', 'known', 'actors', ""N'Bushe"", 'Wright', 'Fresh', 'junkie', 'sister', 'Nichole', 'Jean', 'LaMare', 'Jake', 'hot', 'tempered', 'low-man-on-the-totem-pole', 'employee', 'Corky', 'are', 'also', 'terrific', 'key', 'roles.The', 'screenplay', 'director', 'Boaz', 'Yakin', 'doggedly', 'unpredictable', 'retrospect', 'perfect', 'sense', 'nothing', 'movie', 'bounds', 'credibility', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'truckloads', 'thrillers', 'most', 'are', 'wearily', 'proficient', 'making', 'guess', 'what', 'next', 'None', 'few', 'however', 'kept', 'guessing', 'WHEN', 'guess', 'surprised', 'such', 'affecting', 'emotional', 'developments', 'None', 'few', 'moved', 'along', 'such', 'self-assured', 'grace', 'style', 'Fresh', 'territory', 'time', 'place', 'set', 'characters', 'who', 'talk', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'ones', 'sound', ""'re"", 'movie', 'where', 'talk', 'do', 'real', 'life.The', 'use', 'violence', 'admirably', 'restrained', 'Most', 'place', 'camera', 'silhouetted', 'cut', 'away', 'quickly', 'two', 'scenes', 'bloodletting', 'when', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'literally', 'heartbreaking', 'Not', 'only', 'Fresh', 'keep', 'off', 'guard', 'psychological', 'level', 'emotional', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'something', 'few', 'films', 'ever', 'think', 'doing.If', 'were', 'offer', 'one', 'criticism', 'would', 'be', 'chess', 'metaphor', 'was', 'pressed', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'Yakin', 'final', 'scene', 'devastating', 'already', 'know', 'kid', 'thinking', 'master', 'strategist', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'quite', 'so', 'many', 'shots', 'playing', 'game', 'room', 'small', 'quibble', 'though', 'chess', 'metaphor', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'Jackson', 'early', 'speech', 'game', 'ingenious', 'device']",Fresh VHS

After this Fresh starts to plan out how to save his sister and himself from this type of life, using the chess board to plot out his strategy.

My cousin and myself caught a viewing at the dollar theater two months after it came out.  ""Fresh"" absorbed me from the moment I saw the dilapidated houses and bleek environment that surrounded it.  I knew from there that an interesting story was about to be told. And, boy, was it ever. Michael a.k.a ""Fresh"" is an adolescent that lives with his aunt and about 7 other children that she is raising in a project apartment building.  Fresh is fully aware of his circumstances: Hood life, A missing in action mother, an estranged father and a heroine addicted sister.  He has no one.  And I believe that is what makes his character so complex and emotionally distant.  He wants more, but where does he get it?  From Esteban?, the Kingpin who employs him as a drug runner and claims to honor him for his intelligence then uses him to make advances toward his sister.  From his father?, (brilliantly played by Samuel Jackson) a man who's best days are behind him and who catches up with Fresh occasionally in a park to play chess with him as a way of lightswitch child rearing. From Nikki?, his sister, who lives with a small-time pimp/drug dealer and has less desire and emotion than Fresh (as if that's even possible).  Fresh understands all of this all the more after a life-changing incident alters his mentality about what he's doing and what he wants.  He immediately takes his stance against those who have absolutely no love for him.  One of whom is Jake.  His superior in his employment with Corky, a rival dealer of Esteban.  Fresh utilizes all of the components that this life has given him.

He's a consummate wheeler-dealer, a drug runner who lives his life on the gritty streets of ghetto Brooklyn. He lives fast and hard and at the rate he's going, he'll be lucky to see his thirteenth birthday.Fresh's real name is Michael, and he lives with his Aunt Frances, a self-abnegating caretaker of eleven of Fresh's cousins, who have found with Aunt Frances the first stable home of their lives and don't appreciate Fresh's activities risking their stability. They're scared to be seen on the streets with him. ""I'm not going back to no group home because of you,"" one of his cousins hisses. ""If you mess this up, I'm gonna kill you.""Fresh lives in a world of violence, depravity and despair that no child should ever have to witness. He sits by the bank of the East River and dreams of better things. He looks across the river at the towers of midtown Manhattan, a short subway ride away and as distant and inaccessible to him as the far side of the moon. His world is drugs, which keep him in funds and destroying the life of his teenaged sister, a hard-core junkie prostitute with the face of a black Madonna. His only parent is his dad, a veteran speed-chess player who has taught Fresh everything he knows about the game. ""Your queen is nothing but a pawn with fancy moves,"" he advises Fresh. ""Play your opponent, not the game -- if your opponent plays a defensive game, be aggressive."" And vice-versa. Chess is, after all, a metaphor for life, and the name of the game is survival.Fresh is surviving as best he can. He's a drug runner for two different groups; he runs heroin for Esteban's Latino crew, and crack for Corky's African-American gang. He's smart, savvy, and above all, he knows how to keep his mouth shut. Something his best friend, Chuckie, has never learned and which will eventually end up costing him, big time.Survival in Fresh's world is a dicey prospect, and when one of Corky's lieutenants, a thug named Jake, shoots up the playground after being humiliated in a game of pickup basketball by a much younger player, killing not only his opponent but a little girl Fresh has a crush on, something in Fresh snaps. He's had it with all the drugs and the mayhem that makes up his world. Dad's lessons in speed chess stand him in good stead. Fresh sets up a chessboard in his room, each piece representing a player in his world, and with cold, analytical calculation and breath-taking audacity, he plays both ends against the middle, setting the drug gangs against each other and sitting back to watch them wipe each other out.Boaz Yakin's first feature film is a tour de force which showcases not only himself as a gifted director, but a dazzlingly talented actor in Sean Nelson. Nelson doesn't so much play Fresh as he becomes Fresh. He's such a natural that he doesn't seem to be acting at all. Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as Fresh's dad, a failed person and parent who has managed to give Fresh the one gift he has, a talent for speed chess that helps him transform his life. Giancarlo Esposito is suitably reassuring and menacing by turns as the heroin dealer Esteban, and Ron Brice is chilling as the paranoid crack dealer Corky. Yakin's direction brings out all the grit, the despair and hopelessness of the environment these people are trapped in, either by choice (Corky and Esteban) or involuntarily (Fresh and his sister). We can only wonder what it must be like to live in such a place, with no way out.""Fresh"" suffered from abominable distribution when it was first released in 1994, which prevented it from being much better known. I hadn't even heard of this film until I caught it on cable TV one night a few months ago. Since then I've seen it four times, and each time I come away awed at how Yakin has caught to perfection the lives of his characters and the mean streets they live in. And the final scene, Fresh staring at his dad over one more game of speed chess with tears running down his face, is like a visceral kick.

370405,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6303354912,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 2]","This 1994 film is about a 12-year-old African American boy named Fresh.  He's a quiet boy, with large dark eyes that seem to carry the weight of the world.  That's understandable, given that he is often late for school because he's a drug runner for some vicious drug lords.  The young actor, Sean Nelson, does a remarkable job of bringing this character to life.  And, with constantly escalating experiences of violence, the director, Boaz Yakim, creates an urban nightmare of this world.Fresh lives with his aunt and 11 other children in a small apartment in the projects, which resembles a group home.  His mother doesn't exist in the film, but his father, played by Samuel L. Jackson, has a small, but important part.  His life is already defined as that of a loser, but he keeps his dignity and spends his days hanging out in Washington Square Park and hustling games of chess. Jackson's words of wisdom about the game are basically the only connection he has with his son.Fresh sees more violence and wasted lives than a child should have to.  Somehow, though, he grows wiser than his years.  And as the plot develops with increasing complexity, he devises a plan to manipulate the drug dealers into effectively eliminating each other.  It might seem a little far fetched for a 12-year-old to do this, but it is done so well, that it all seemed possible.There are many upsetting scenes in this film, as there should be.  Life is sad and painful for the young boy.  We root for him as he fights his way out.  And definitely can relate to the touching conclusion.

370407,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,6303354912,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[39, 40]","Michael, a.k.a. ""Fresh"", is a 12-year-old drug dealer who lives in a run-down house with his aunt and other orphaned children in a dangerous Brooklyn neighborhood. Having grown up in a harsh culture, he is a boy who shows little emotion despite witnessing the revulsion of street life on a regular basis. His mother is long gone, his sister has resorted to prostitution, and his father is completely estranged-although every now and then he meets with his father to play speed chess, through which he is taught street knowledge. At first Fresh aspires to live the life of a powerful drug dealer, but one day a heartrending incident causes him to rethink his dreams and consider a better possible future.Directed by Boaz Yakin (who also directed ""Remember the Titans""--a *completely* different film), ""Fresh"" is an astonishingly well-done film that left me stunned long after it ended. By depicting a brutal life through the eyes of a young boy, the film tells a bleak story by taking its viewers on a roller-coaster ride of gut-wrenching scenes, and yet in the process it still manages to engage the audience and finally arrive at a surprising conclusion.Although the first third of the film is basically used to give the viewer a tour of Fresh's neighborhood, the plot soon becomes very complex after one particular scene. Fresh's life literally becomes a game of chess, represented by the moves the pieces make and the strategy used to stay alive. Despite the film's quiet atmosphere, it moves at a rapid pace and forces the audience to listen closely in order to keep on track with the plot. The plot moves unpredictably throughout, but every one of its elements makes perfect sense after a bit of thinking. And although the script is heavy on profanity, it is totally realistic in depicting the everyday life of the characters, and the dialogue between Fresh and his father during their chess matches is especially good.The picture is shot on low-budget film, making the Brooklyn neighborhood feel all the more dark and unwelcoming. But there are no prolonged fight scenes, nor is there a lot of on-screen brutality. There are, however, a lot of tragic scenes that really hit home, and they are shot with rapid film editing and camera work that didn't require any computer enhancements. Simply put, no unnecessary visual techniques are used.The acting is superb all around. Sean Nelson, in his debut role, is stunning as Fresh; he is so compelling in the way he conveys his emotions without having to say anything, and he feels so natural that it seems as if he doesn't even know the camera's on him for more than 90% of the film. For this to come out of a debut performance is impressive enough; but for it to come out of such a young actor is truly astonishing. Supporting roles include Samuel L. Jackson, who expresses a great sense of authority as Fresh's father, and Giancarlo Esposito, who is absolutely chilling as the ""black king"" of the film.And the ending is unforgettable. In fact, it is not the unpredictable denouement that the viewer remembers best; it is the very last image.  In one final shot, all the emotion that had built up to that point bursts out in a brief, silent moment. It is a deeply moving way to end the film, and it gave me a faint sense of hope despite all the sorrow and horror that had already happened.""Fresh"" is a tiny film that manages to be riveting, frightening, disturbing, contemplative, poignant, and faintly uplifting all at once, and that alone makes it one of the most memorable films I have ever seen. But with acting, filming, and screenplay all being top-notch without any other frills, ""Fresh"" is also a brilliant work that uses only the most basic aspects of film to their fullest extent. It features many upsetting scenes and is definitely not for all viewers, and due to the plot and script it can be a very challenging film to watch at times, but it is an unconventional example of a director and cast at the top of their form. I easily recommend ""Fresh"" to film lovers everywhere.",5,"""Anything lost can be found again, except for time wasted.""",1078012800,"02 29, 2004",2004,4038,"['Michael', 'a.k.a', 'Fresh', '12-year-old', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'run-down', 'house', 'aunt', 'other', 'orphaned', 'children', 'dangerous', 'Brooklyn', 'neighborhood', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'harsh', 'culture', 'boy', 'who', 'little', 'emotion', 'witnessing', 'revulsion', 'street', 'life', 'regular', 'basis', 'mother', 'long', 'gone', 'sister', 'resorted', 'prostitution', 'father', 'completely', 'estranged-although', 'now', 'then', 'father', 'play', 'speed', 'chess', 'taught', 'street', 'knowledge', 'first', 'Fresh', 'aspires', 'live', 'life', 'powerful', 'drug', 'dealer', 'one', 'day', 'heartrending', 'incident', 'rethink', 'dreams', 'consider', 'better', 'possible', 'future.Directed', 'Boaz', 'Yakin', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Remember', 'Titans', '*completely*', 'different', 'film', 'Fresh', 'astonishingly', 'well-done', 'film', 'left', 'stunned', 'long', 'ended', 'depicting', 'brutal', 'life', 'eyes', 'young', 'boy', 'film', 'bleak', 'story', 'taking', 'viewers', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'gut-wrenching', 'scenes', 'yet', 'process', 'still', 'engage', 'audience', 'finally', 'arrive', 'surprising', 'conclusion.Although', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'basically', 'used', 'give', 'viewer', 'tour', 'Fresh', 'neighborhood', 'plot', 'soon', 'very', 'complex', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'Fresh', 'life', 'literally', 'game', 'chess', 'represented', 'moves', 'pieces', 'make', 'strategy', 'used', 'stay', 'alive', 'film', 'quiet', 'atmosphere', 'rapid', 'pace', 'audience', 'listen', 'closely', 'order', 'keep', 'track', 'plot', 'plot', 'unpredictably', 'one', 'elements', 'perfect', 'sense', 'bit', 'thinking', 'script', 'heavy', 'profanity', 'totally', 'realistic', 'depicting', 'everyday', 'life', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'Fresh', 'father', 'chess', 'matches', 'especially', 'good.The', 'picture', 'shot', 'low-budget', 'film', 'making', 'Brooklyn', 'neighborhood', 'feel', 'more', 'dark', 'unwelcoming', 'are', 'prolonged', 'fight', 'scenes', 'lot', 'on-screen', 'brutality', 'are', 'however', 'lot', 'tragic', 'scenes', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'are', 'shot', 'rapid', 'film', 'editing', 'camera', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'computer', 'enhancements', 'Simply', 'put', 'unnecessary', 'visual', 'techniques', 'are', 'used.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'around', 'Sean', 'Nelson', 'debut', 'role', 'stunning', 'Fresh', 'so', 'compelling', 'way', 'emotions', 'having', 'say', 'anything', 'so', 'natural', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'camera', 'more', '90', '%', 'film', 'come', 'debut', 'performance', 'impressive', 'enough', 'come', 'such', 'young', 'actor', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'Supporting', 'roles', 'include', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'who', 'great', 'sense', 'authority', 'Fresh', 'father', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'who', 'absolutely', 'chilling', 'black', 'king', 'film.And', 'ending', 'unforgettable', 'fact', 'not', 'unpredictable', 'denouement', 'viewer', 'remembers', 'best', 'very', 'last', 'image', 'one', 'final', 'shot', 'emotion', 'had', 'built', 'up', 'point', 'out', 'brief', 'silent', 'moment', 'deeply', 'moving', 'way', 'end', 'film', 'gave', 'faint', 'sense', 'hope', 'sorrow', 'horror', 'had', 'already', 'happened', 'Fresh', 'tiny', 'film', 'be', 'riveting', 'frightening', 'disturbing', 'contemplative', 'poignant', 'faintly', 'uplifting', 'once', 'alone', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'acting', 'filming', 'screenplay', 'being', 'top-notch', 'other', 'frills', 'Fresh', 'also', 'brilliant', 'work', 'only', 'most', 'basic', 'aspects', 'film', 'fullest', 'extent', 'many', 'upsetting', 'scenes', 'definitely', 'not', 'viewers', 'due', 'plot', 'script', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'challenging', 'film', 'watch', 'times', 'unconventional', 'example', 'director', 'cast', 'top', 'form', 'easily', 'recommend', 'Fresh', 'film', 'lovers', 'everywhere']",Fresh VHS

He pushes drugs for 2 crime lords Corky(Ron Brice) and Estebon(Giancarlo Esposito) to get rich quick.  When he isn't hustling, he's a decent chess player but losses to his father Sam(Samuel L.

While Boyz in the Hood, and Menece II Society only provides messages, Fresh delivers not only a hard fact message, but a solid grade A story with action that suits the timings, for a near perfect balanced movie.

My expectations were high. And I was anything but disappointed, the action-packed thriller stands heads above many films in its genre -- urban crime drama, or hood flicks, or what have you.At the very least, it doesn't suffer from the usual cliches of such films. Rap and R&amp;B type music is incidental to the plot, giving way to a poignant soundtrack by Stewart Copeland. For once, gang life, alcoholism, and drug addiction are not glamourized as the &quot;what else&quot; recourse for the poor African American kids. Instead such ills are condemned.The pivotal character as an intellectual prodigy is neither a joke nor a gimmick, his mind is the means of his survival and eventually his triumph over the forces around him. The cast is excellent, the standouts being an extraordinary debut by Sean Nelson as &quot;Fresh&quot; (title role) and the reliable Samuel J as his alcoholic speed-chess-master father.The final scene is one of the most devastating and memorable scenes in the last decade of films.

370421,A3N9TGJFS6IQFY,6303354912,SheLikesDvds.com,"[1, 4]","Fresh is a film that troubles the soul and breaks your heart. This violent coming of age tale tells the story of Michael a.k.a. Fresh, a 12-year-old drug dealer who lives in a neighborhood without any real hope, and his struggle to keep himself alive. In a world where paranoia, guns and drugs are a way of life, it is amazing that Fresh not only survives but also comes out on top of the game. Be warned though, you won't like this boy. He does things that can only be described as monstrous but you will understand why he commits the sins that he does. One cannot remain an innocent, a child, and still exist in his reality. Sean Nelson, as Michael/Fresh, gives a brilliant performance that remains understated yet powerful. The entire experience is worthwhile just to see this child at work. Fresh is low budget independent film but boasts a couple of well-known actors such as acclaimed performer, Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson gives a decent, if unmemorable performance, as the absentee alcoholic father who disperses advice on life while using the chessboard as a metaphor. Chess is a recurrent theme of the film and for those who love the game, it will add another layer of symbolic meaning to story.However, not everything with this film is happiness and roses. The audio/music track is terrible and disrupts the dialogue. The middle of the film drags the action down and the lack of budget shows in many of the interior scenes. On occasion, the director oversells his message and in other places, I was left wondering why a scene was occurring (dog-shooting). Since this was Boaz Yakin&#65533;s (Return of the Titans) first directing attempt, I can understand where the film&#65533;s shortcomings are coming from but it still doesn&#65533;t excuse it. Overall, the movie gets a passing grade and I would recommend it for rental.

Known as Fresh, the young man must use his delivery jobs to support himself and his troubled sister, receiving nothing from his distant, alcoholic father but the occasional chess lesson. His intelligence and quiet determination serve him well, as he wins the trust of his employer and settles into an unpleasant but survivable routine. Even this small comfort disappears, however, when Fresh accidentally witnesses the killing of a classmate and becomes a potential target himself. Giancarlo Esposito (the smooth talking drugs dealer) and Samuel L. Jackson (the alcoholic chess-master tramp) give strong, realistic performances in challenging roles. The other characters (like N'Bushe Wright's portrayal of Fresh's sister) are also incredibly well played, and every single one of them is believable. The script is also fantastic.

In the world of 90s black gangsta films Fresh takes a grueling look at a 12 year old drug runner well played by Sean Nelson. Much maybe too much foul language can make the movie  seem cheap and futile at times. This may be the darkest film of it's kind  as you witness a young girl murdred in a basketball game in a crossfire by  a disgrunted player. While it is obvious (Boaz) is going for some shock  value he cunningly casts Samuel L. Jackson in a limited role as Fresh's  estranged father and maybe more importantly Giancarlo Esposito as drug  pusher and boyfriend to Fresh's older sister. Giancarlo steals this movie  as a guy you love to hate and a very familiar street type. Sean Nelson as  Fresh is amazing in his ability to make you see his tolerance for the pain  of his dysfunctional childhood. He uses his gifted intelligence to escape  what could be a very catostrophic situation. Just a note that although the  bad language is neccesary it's use seems like an alternative to good  script. Lines seem to be ad libed by the young actors. This movie however  dark and disturbing does what it intends to do. It tells it's streetlife  story without glamourizing it!
