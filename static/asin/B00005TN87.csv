681866,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B00005TN87,e. verrillo,"[1, 1]","I have heard that the novels by Elizabeth Jane Howard upon which this teleplay was based are quite good. Unfortunately, after watching this insipid series, I have no motivation to read them. Douglas Livingstone's screenplay was so lifeless, and the acting so stilted that it was nearly impossible to sit through the majority of these painfully dull episodes. The plot consisted of a string of extramarital affairs that were so boring one wonders why the participants bothered, sporadically interrupted by spoilt children whining ""I'm sick of being treated like a child!"" Frankly, it was impossible to care about such poorly drawn, two-dimensional characters, no matter how many temper tantrums they threw. Neither was there any real attempt at capturing the spirit of the times. In comparison to Foyle's War, which not only managed to bring the history of WWII in Britain to life, but developed believable, appealing characters - or Downton Abbey, which brilliantly conveyed the personal upheavals of its characters within the context of Britain's changing class structure, this series falls far short of the mark.",1,Uninspired ... and uninspiring,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,1114,"['have', 'heard', 'novels', 'Elizabeth', 'Jane', 'Howard', 'teleplay', 'was', 'based', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Unfortunately', 'watching', 'insipid', 'series', 'have', 'motivation', 'read', 'Douglas', 'Livingstone', 'screenplay', 'was', 'so', 'lifeless', 'acting', 'so', 'stilted', 'was', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'sit', 'majority', 'painfully', 'dull', 'episodes', 'plot', 'consisted', 'string', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'were', 'so', 'boring', 'one', 'why', 'participants', 'bothered', 'sporadically', 'interrupted', 'spoilt', 'children', 'whining', ""'m"", 'sick', 'being', 'treated', 'child', 'Frankly', 'was', 'impossible', 'care', 'such', 'poorly', 'drawn', 'two-dimensional', 'characters', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'threw', 'was', 'there', 'real', 'attempt', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'times', 'comparison', 'Foyle', 'War', 'not', 'only', 'managed', 'bring', 'history', 'WWII', 'Britain', 'life', 'developed', 'believable', 'appealing', 'characters', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'brilliantly', 'conveyed', 'personal', 'upheavals', 'characters', 'context', 'Britain', 'changing', 'class', 'structure', 'series', 'far', 'short', 'mark']",Masterpiece Theatre - The Cazalets VHS
681867,A2SSBTV5US30QL,B00005TN87,James Hunt,"[1, 1]","I have always considered WWII to be in the modern era but it was 70 years ago so I guess The Cazalets qualifies as a ""period piece"".  In reading the other reviews it was amazing that there was such a difference of opinion regarding the show.  For me, the acting was great as was the attention to period detail.I didn't see it when it originally aired on television.  The blurb on the case quoting the N.Y. Times says ""The Cazalets is the sort of family saga that American audiences have loved since Upstairs Downstairs.""  The difference in the two is the way they are formatted.  In Up/Down there was certainly a continuity to the episodes but each one told a self-contained story focusing on one or a few of the characters.  In that way you got to know all the characters in depth over the course of a season.  The Cazalets, on the other hand, is presented in soap opera style with multiple stories running concurrently throughout the series, switching back and forth between them within every episode.  The editing is well done and it works o.k. on dvd's where you can watch the whole series in a few evenings.  Also helpful is the fold-out built into the dvd case which shows the faces and names of the principal characters presented in a family tree diagram.  I referred to that several times.  Watching the series on t.v., one episode a week, must have been confusing.A number of reviewers complained about the emphasis on sex.  There is a brief instance of nudity (upper female) in the first episode and lots of scenes with groping and pulling at clothes.  In later episodes other stories become more prominent.  In retrospect, I wonder if they included the suggestive scenes as a way of getting some publicity for the show?  It certainly is not suitable for children.The only real complaint I have is that the show was not renewed for a second season.  It ends abruptly and you are left wondering what would have happened next.I would recommend it to any Anglophile if you can get it for a reasonable price, about 10 to 12 dollars.",4,Good British drama but not finished,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,2038,"['have', 'always', 'considered', 'WWII', 'be', 'modern', 'era', 'was', '70', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'guess', 'Cazalets', 'period', 'piece', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'was', 'amazing', 'was', 'such', 'difference', 'opinion', 'regarding', 'show', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'attention', 'period', 'detail.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'television', 'blurb', 'case', 'quoting', 'N.Y.', 'Times', 'Cazalets', 'sort', 'family', 'saga', 'American', 'audiences', 'have', 'loved', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'difference', 'two', 'way', 'are', 'formatted', 'Up/Down', 'was', 'certainly', 'continuity', 'episodes', 'one', 'told', 'self-contained', 'story', 'focusing', 'one', 'few', 'characters', 'way', 'got', 'know', 'characters', 'depth', 'course', 'season', 'Cazalets', 'other', 'hand', 'presented', 'soap', 'opera', 'style', 'multiple', 'stories', 'running', 'concurrently', 'series', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'episode', 'editing', 'well', 'done', 'o.k', 'dvd', 'where', 'can', 'watch', 'whole', 'series', 'few', 'evenings', 'Also', 'helpful', 'fold-out', 'built', 'dvd', 'case', 'names', 'principal', 'characters', 'presented', 'family', 'tree', 'diagram', 'referred', 'several', 'times', 'Watching', 'series', 't.v.', 'one', 'episode', 'week', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'confusing.A', 'number', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'emphasis', 'sex', 'brief', 'instance', 'nudity', 'upper', 'female', 'first', 'episode', 'lots', 'scenes', 'groping', 'pulling', 'clothes', 'later', 'other', 'stories', 'become', 'more', 'prominent', 'retrospect', 'wonder', 'included', 'suggestive', 'scenes', 'way', 'getting', 'publicity', 'show', 'certainly', 'not', 'suitable', 'children.The', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'have', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'renewed', 'second', 'season', 'abruptly', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'next.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'Anglophile', 'can', 'get', 'reasonable', 'price', 'about', '10', '12', 'dollars']",Masterpiece Theatre - The Cazalets VHS

Imagine the delights that further await you in the remaining four.  Hardly a likeable character in the bunch; the kids are all criminally indulged and brats until the last episode when death, the great equalizer,  brings them together.Out of all the characters, Hugh is the most likeable.  He adores his cancer stricken wife and he's faithful to her, something that his brother Edward cannot be to *his* wife.  Edward has a cigarette in his mouth in every scene unless he's holding a drink, although sometimes he has both.  [...].  Such a dilemma for the poor old chap.  Oh but he loves his daughter, you see.Christopher, the ""conchie"", doesn't evoke sympathy, empathy or any kind of emotion other than annoyance.  I don't even know why time was wasted on this character.  He added nothing to the story except to take up space.  None of the characters were fully developed and the story ended leaving us hanging as to what happened to Rupert, for example, and even w/annoying Christopher.Look for a character by the name of Mrs. Cripps, the cook, who's played by Jacqueline Tong from Upstairs Downstairs.  I recognized her voice before her face; time has not been kind to her.  We really weren't too privvy to what took place ""downstairs"" in this household, which I think would've been a darn sight more interesting than what took place upstairs, I can tell you.I rated The Cazalets 2 stars because I did like the nostalgia that the time period evoked but that's it.

681873,AITI12BBKCYG9,B00005TN87,"N. Thomas ""LibraryFiend""","[13, 16]","I really did enjoy ""The Cazalets"" -- although, as other reviews indicate, it is left unfinished.  I don't believe there are any plans to complete the series, however, so one is handicapped by ridiculous cliffhangers, like the fate of Rupert.I have not read the Elizabeth Jane Howard novels (although I would like to at some point), and due to that I found many of the characters difficult to follow -- for example, there is a distinct focus on only the eldest Cazalet grandchildren, Louise, Polly, and Clary, to the detriment of the others.  I believe Edward and Villy have a son, Edward Jr., who is hardly ever in the program.  Also, two of the Cazalet sons, Edward and Hugh, have younger children, who are never fully connected to their parents.  For example, I believe Lydia Cazalet was the daughter of Hugh and the long-suffering Sybil, but am not positive.  Also, Villy and Sybil also have infant children (who grow into toddlers as the series progresses), the names of whom I cannot even say I processed since they were so seldom seen or mentioned.  While I know this setup, i.e., having very young offfspring placed in the charge of nurses, governesses, and tutors (ah, the saintly Miss Millament!) was common among the upper crust, it made the family appear disjointed.  Finally, were Christopher and his mother related to the Cazalets?  I had a sense Mrs. Castle (Christopher's mother) was Villy Cazalet's sister, but, ONCE AGAIN, where was the solid evidence to support this...?!  N-O-W-H-E-R-E!!!The acting was very well executed in this piece.  I agree that while life in World War II England couldn't have been as rosy for most people, even the upper classes (of which the Cazalets aren't even a proper part, as they are not members of the nobility or peerage), as the Cazalets enjoyed during that period, I was willing to overlook this suspension of fact in order to better appreciate the inter-familial drama.",4,Very entertaining!,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,1924,"['really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Cazalets', 'other', 'reviews', 'indicate', 'left', 'unfinished', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'are', 'plans', 'complete', 'series', 'however', 'one', 'handicapped', 'ridiculous', 'cliffhangers', 'fate', 'Rupert.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Elizabeth', 'Jane', 'Howard', 'novels', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'due', 'found', 'many', 'characters', 'difficult', 'follow', 'example', 'distinct', 'focus', 'only', 'eldest', 'Cazalet', 'grandchildren', 'Louise', 'Polly', 'Clary', 'detriment', 'others', 'believe', 'Edward', 'Villy', 'have', 'son', 'Edward', 'Jr.', 'who', 'hardly', 'ever', 'program', 'Also', 'two', 'Cazalet', 'sons', 'Edward', 'Hugh', 'have', 'younger', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'connected', 'parents', 'example', 'believe', 'Lydia', 'Cazalet', 'was', 'daughter', 'Hugh', 'long-suffering', 'Sybil', 'am', 'not', 'positive', 'Also', 'Villy', 'Sybil', 'also', 'have', 'infant', 'children', 'who', 'grow', 'toddlers', 'series', 'names', 'whom', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'say', 'processed', 'were', 'so', 'seldom', 'seen', 'mentioned', 'know', 'setup', 'i.e.', 'having', 'very', 'young', 'offfspring', 'placed', 'charge', 'nurses', 'governesses', 'tutors', 'ah', 'saintly', 'Miss', 'Millament', 'was', 'common', 'upper', 'crust', 'made', 'family', 'appear', 'disjointed', 'Finally', 'were', 'Christopher', 'mother', 'related', 'Cazalets', 'had', 'sense', 'Mrs.', 'Castle', 'Christopher', 'mother', 'was', 'Villy', 'Cazalet', 'sister', 'ONCE', 'AGAIN', 'where', 'was', 'solid', 'evidence', 'support', 'N-O-W-H-E-R-E', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'piece', 'agree', 'life', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'England', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'rosy', 'most', 'people', 'even', 'upper', 'classes', 'Cazalets', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'proper', 'part', 'are', 'not', 'members', 'nobility', 'peerage', 'Cazalets', 'enjoyed', 'period', 'was', 'willing', 'overlook', 'suspension', 'fact', 'order', 'better', 'appreciate', 'inter-familial', 'drama']",Masterpiece Theatre - The Cazalets VHS

The film breaks off about half way through the war while the novels continue through until the end of the war. The way the film ends it feels as if the people making this intended to continue in another season, so it finishes with a lot of loose ends. Despite that fairly serious flaw, the superb character development and the rich range of very real individuals who range from young children to very elderly, from sleazy to incredibly noble and self-sacrificing, makes this something not to be missed. This is about the home front and is a bit more about the women than the men, but the male characters, I thought, were as well developed as the females. In the interest of not offending those who are more puritanical than I, I should mention that there is a very tender, very closeted lesbian relationship involving one family member. In addition, there is a male family member who is less than faithful to his wife. In neither case does much happen on camera. The Cazalet's are in the main generous and loving people.

Usually anything from Masterpiece Theatre is excellent--but this one surpassed many other mini-series they've done. The intertwining stories of all the members of the Cazalet family are artfully put together in such a way that it keeps the viewer constantly interested. The costumes were very true to the era and the jazzy theme music sounded like a real tune right out of the 1940's. Among the engrossing characters there were two who stood out the most.

You really get the feel that the characters are individuals and that their trials and tribulations are real. I particularly liked the stories of the young married wife Chloe and her relationship with the wounded soldier, and the friendships between the young cousins. I didn't care that much for the conscientious objector storyline that took up the third DVD. Perhaps if the character had been more endearing, but the kid was annoying, and the story took up way too much of the DVD. Overall, a good period drama. Too bad it isn't complete!",5,Enjoyable...

Having not read the books, I've now reserved them at the library, because I've become so interested in the story that I want to follow the characters through the war years and to the end of the saga.Actually, I have another, milder, disappointment.
