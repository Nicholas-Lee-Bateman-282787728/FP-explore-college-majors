107092,A1AUOVXPT5MYX4,0790739739,"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[1, 1]","The Negotiator is an excellent action/thriller with 2 great performances from Kevin Spacey and Samuel Jackson. Despite being billed as an action film, this isn't your standard brainless Van Damme flick. The impression throughout the movie is tense. The best thing about the movie is the dialogue.Both Spacey and Jackson are negotiators. Jackson is accused of murdering his partner and is determined to prove his innocence. He does a good job acting as an on the edge, almost out of control guy to the negotiators but also does a good job convincing his hostages and the audience that he is innocent. Spacey arrives almost half way thru the movie but is outstanding in his scenes. He immediately takes over the negotiations with Jackson's character from a helpless, nervous negotiator who Jackson made a complete fool of in a couple of especially good scenes.This film made sense, and provided a good, logical ending. I wish more movies were half as good as this one. The plot twists are interesting, and not as shallow as the average film in the genre. The story is very original, and Gary Gray is in my opinion one of the most underrated directors today and deserves credit for putting this together. Fans of the genre should admire this movie, while many others can probably appreciate what it has to offer. Solid entertainment for 140 minutes.",4,One of the best action-thrillers,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,1346,"['Negotiator', 'excellent', 'action/thriller', '2', 'great', 'performances', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'being', 'billed', 'action', 'film', ""n't"", 'standard', 'brainless', 'Van', 'Damme', 'flick', 'impression', 'movie', 'tense', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'dialogue.Both', 'Spacey', 'Jackson', 'are', 'negotiators', 'Jackson', 'accused', 'murdering', 'partner', 'determined', 'prove', 'innocence', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'edge', 'almost', 'control', 'guy', 'negotiators', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'convincing', 'hostages', 'audience', 'innocent', 'Spacey', 'almost', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'scenes', 'immediately', 'negotiations', 'Jackson', 'character', 'helpless', 'nervous', 'negotiator', 'who', 'Jackson', 'made', 'complete', 'fool', 'couple', 'especially', 'good', 'scenes.This', 'film', 'made', 'sense', 'provided', 'good', 'logical', 'ending', 'wish', 'more', 'movies', 'were', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'interesting', 'not', 'as', 'shallow', 'average', 'film', 'genre', 'story', 'very', 'original', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'opinion', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'directors', 'today', 'credit', 'putting', 'together', 'Fans', 'genre', 'should', 'admire', 'movie', 'many', 'others', 'can', 'probably', 'appreciate', 'what', 'offer', 'Solid', 'entertainment', '140', 'minutes']",N/A
107093,A2QASAMGT1UYZ3,0790739739,Alexis_Ray,"[3, 3]","One day Lt. Danny Roman (Samuel Jackson) is a celebrated hostage negotiator. The next, he's a suspect, accused of corruption and murder by his own colleagues. Desperate to prove his innocence and discover the truth, Danny takes hostages in a government office, hoping to gain time - and information.Suspecting that members of his own department may have been involved in framing him, Roman demands to speak to hostage negotiator Lt. Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey, who is letter-perfect) - a man from across town, a man he doesn't even know.Under F. Gary Gray's direction, this seemingly unlikely scenario unfolds (for the most part) with surprising convincingness.Regina Taylor adds a nice dramatic touch as Karen, Roman's young, dedicated wife, who supports him but wishes he would stop acting 'crazy.' The film's best moments, however, come when Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey's characters face off. It's an acting showcase of the 'you've gotta see it to believe it' variety.There's also action here and some very nice cinematography.Though The Negotiator's running time is 139 minutes, its pace rarely slackens and you'll likely be left guessing til the last minute. You will need your suspension of disbelief to carry you through a few moments, but overall this is an entertaining, fast-paced thriller to be savored for its fine performances.",4,An Underrated Thriller,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,1344,"['One', 'day', 'Lt.', 'Danny', 'Roman', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'celebrated', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'next', 'suspect', 'accused', 'corruption', 'murder', 'own', 'colleagues', 'Desperate', 'prove', 'innocence', 'discover', 'truth', 'Danny', 'hostages', 'government', 'office', 'hoping', 'gain', 'time', 'information.Suspecting', 'members', 'own', 'department', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'framing', 'Roman', 'speak', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'Lt.', 'Chris', 'Sabian', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', 'letter-perfect', 'man', 'town', 'man', ""n't"", 'even', 'know.Under', 'F.', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'direction', 'seemingly', 'unlikely', 'scenario', 'unfolds', 'most', 'part', 'surprising', 'convincingness.Regina', 'Taylor', 'nice', 'dramatic', 'touch', 'Karen', 'Roman', 'young', 'dedicated', 'wife', 'who', 'would', 'stop', 'acting', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'however', 'come', 'when', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'characters', 'face', 'off', 'acting', 'showcase', ""'you"", ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'believe', 'also', 'action', 'here', 'very', 'nice', 'Negotiator', 'running', 'time', '139', 'minutes', 'pace', 'rarely', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'be', 'left', 'guessing', 'last', 'minute', 'will', 'need', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'carry', 'few', 'moments', 'overall', 'entertaining', 'fast-paced', 'thriller', 'be', 'savored', 'fine', 'performances']",N/A

Great action  films are not about good and bad guys, but complex charactors who both want something.The Negotiator is perfect for both Kevin Spacey and Samual L Jackson, two of our best actors. Every great actor has to answer one question about his charactor: what do I want? Here, Jackson wants to clear his name, and Spacey wants to retrieve hostages Jackson holds. This sets the conflict in bare bones terms as only the action genre can. The actors have room to develop their charactors.Both charactors are decent, smart men, put in unthinkable circumstances, two hostage experts matching the sharpest of minds.  There is plenty of action, but most of the tension comes from the mental game  Spacey and Jackson are playing. The mental game played with A LOT of guns around. It is what MIGHT go wrong that makes the film so frightening. How far will these guys go? Are they going to outsmart the other into a bloodbath?Jackson's motives are obvious, but the movie does not explain why Spacey allies with him by films end and goes to the lengths he does.Still, this is a great film from a genre bad actors exploit too much and great actors don't exploit enough.",5,Classic,1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,1242,"['Great', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'just', 'bad', 'ones', 'are', 'bad', 'actors', 'Great', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'about', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'complex', 'charactors', 'who', 'want', 'something.The', 'Negotiator', 'perfect', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Samual', 'L', 'Jackson', 'two', 'best', 'actors', 'Every', 'great', 'actor', 'answer', 'one', 'question', 'charactor', 'what', 'do', 'want', 'Here', 'Jackson', 'clear', 'name', 'Spacey', 'retrieve', 'hostages', 'Jackson', 'conflict', 'bare', 'bones', 'terms', 'only', 'action', 'genre', 'can', 'actors', 'have', 'room', 'develop', 'charactors.Both', 'charactors', 'are', 'decent', 'smart', 'men', 'put', 'unthinkable', 'circumstances', 'two', 'hostage', 'experts', 'matching', 'sharpest', 'minds', 'plenty', 'action', 'most', 'tension', 'mental', 'game', 'Spacey', 'Jackson', 'are', 'playing', 'mental', 'game', 'played', 'A', 'LOT', 'guns', 'what', 'MIGHT', 'go', 'wrong', 'film', 'so', 'frightening', 'How', 'far', 'will', 'guys', 'go', 'Are', 'going', 'outsmart', 'other', 'bloodbath', 'Jackson', 'motives', 'are', 'obvious', 'movie', 'not', 'explain', 'why', 'Spacey', 'allies', 'films', 'end', 'lengths', 'does.Still', 'great', 'film', 'genre', 'bad', 'actors', 'exploit', 'too', 'much', 'great', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'exploit', 'enough']",N/A
107098,AK2AQIULQDFS5,0790739739,Bradley Tobin,"[4, 4]","2 of my All-Time Favourite Actors Square off in ""The Negotiator"", an Underrated Thriller which still manages to get to me, viewing after viewing after viewing.Samuel L Jackson plays Danny Roman, a Chicago Hostage Negotiator who is being Set Up for the Murder of his Partner; he realises the only way to prove his Innocence is to Take some Hostages of his own. He demands that they bring in fellow Negotiator Chris Sabian so he can negotiate his way out.The film is Expertly brought to the screen, for some reason all the Cop stuff looks more Realistic here than in Most Action films. The Technical Advisors deserve a Big pat on the back, as does director F Gary Grey, who resists the temptation to let the film deteriorate into another Bullet-fest. He keeps the Action more on the Intellectual side.Samuel is as Dynamite as ever. He (and the director) puts us in Roman's shoes and he reacts the way that I would (like Mel Gibson in ""Ransom""). Kevin plays Second fiddle to Samuel, but theirs no shame it that, it's still a great fiddle he's playing. He, like Samuel, looks like he's been a hostage negotiator all his life, and they make it look easy.The only reason the film gets 4 instead of 5 is the ending, which comes to quickly and is a little Anti-climatic. I just didn't seem to want the film to end.The supporting cast is to Die for. David Morse, John Spencer, Ron Rifkin, Paul Guilfoyle and the Greatly Missed J T Walsh in his last Big Screen role.

A ""walk through""?  Academy Award winner Spacey and nominee Samuel L. Jackson could have phoned in these performances if they had wanted.  The fact that they give this otherwise routine action film their best shot speaks volumes for their professionalism and commitment.Of course, it doesn't hurt your career any to demonstrate a little flexibility, and why should all the action flick leads go to lesser actors like Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone.  And of course, the stellar cast lends the film a certain cachet.  It seems to be trying very hard, at least, to be a thinking man's actioner.  To some degree, it succeeds, although that may have more to do with the intensity of the stars' performances rather than the script itself.The acting chops are not just limited to the two stars, either.  Veteran character actors like John Spencer, J.T. Walsh, David Morse, and Ron Rifkin all turn in fine performances.  CSI's Paul Guilfoyle appears in an (unaccountably uncredited) key role.  The hostages include two colorful characters played by Siobhan Fallon (who could have waltzed in from a 40s era ""working gal"" flick) and Paul Giammatti.  Wonderful performances all.  The cinematgraphy is top notch to boot.Speaking of TV, though, police dramas are one genre where television has it all over the cinema.  Why?  Well, characterization for one.  Despite the all-around good work of the actors here, you can't really say you get to know them in the course of the film's two hours runtime.  The obligatory domestic scenes are rushed and way too sketchy (and in the brief scenes with Spacey's charater, his wife and daughter, too cute by about three quarters).

He says that it has to do with internal affairs. Danny decides to meet him but instead finds his dead body. He's been murdered. Danny has been framed for his murder and framed for stealing money from the fund. Danny is probably going to go to jail. For a long time. He can't let that happen. And he's really pissed now. Danny goes to internal affairs and takes hostages. Inside the building is a key player in internal affairs along with his secretary and some other people. Danny is going to get out the truth, one way or another. Danny knows everything that the police will do because he's part of them. He's one tough customer and he wants the truth. The only problem is that there are traitors among the police officers that want him dead, and not arrested.

107133,A26X2TG93OTXVU,0790739739,Justin Heath,"[22, 22]","Just when you think he's cornered, he thinks of a new strategy. Samuel L. Jackson portrays Lieutenant Danny Roman, police hostage negotiator. When he's framed for a crime he didn't commit, against his fellow police officers no less, he knows that the only way out is to bring in an equally tough negotiator, Lieutenant Chris Sabian played by Kevin Spacey, who's from another precinct and who therefore could not have been contaminated by the bad elements within his own force, which buys him the necessary time to bluff and blindside while he finds the clues he needs to prove he's innocent. Chicago is taken hostage along with the few people he retains as bargaining chips, and we are taken along for the ride. This was a masterful job of film-making from beginning to end. The characters and story were flawlessly developed. We don't precisely know who's guilty or who's innocent. Roman conducts his interrogation and trial while he negotiates with the police outside, some of whom are working overtime to eliminate Roman before he figures it all out. This all occurs right under the noses of the FBI who are in way over their heads and don't have a clue who's guilty or innocent, just like the rest of us watching. Along the way, we get to witness Roman lecture his underlings about the finer points of negotiations while he himself has just become a hostage taker. ""Never say no!"" he barks with effective zeal. And he tests his bewildered pupils continuously, who fail continuously. Only Sabian is smart enough to understand what's going on in Roman's mind. The strategy is shared by two men who think alike, who are under stress, and have an innate instinct for lie detection. The screenplay was terrific. The cinematography was effective. The acting of Jackson and Spacey exceptional. And the supporting cast, particularly bad-guy-turned-good-guy Paul Giamatti who provides great comic relief, was outstanding.

107146,A152C8GYY25HAH,0790739739,Matthew Horner,"[1, 4]","""The Negotiator"" is unoriginal, and it's hampered by an implausible script. It is very nearly salvaged by a lot of intense action, excellent special effects, crisp dialog, a fine musical score and dynamite performances from Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey.Jackson and Spacey play Chicago cops whose special training is in negotiating with criminals in hostage situations. Such a job may actually exist, but I doubt many people are employed in it full time. Whatever the case, it's not a profession that I'd recommend.Jackson's precinct is full of corrupt officers who have been stealing money from the police pension fund. When his partner discovers the fraud, he is silenced before he can tell Jackson. Naturally, our hero is framed for the murder. Sound familiar?The cop's life, as well as the plot, quickly starts to fall apart. The evidence against him is circumstantial, and most of it would be inadmissible in court. Yet it's enough to make Jackson go off the deep end. He decides to hold two superior officers, a secretary and a petty thief hostage in a Federal office tower.When his demands are not met immediately, he insists that Spacey, who is a stranger to him, be called in. He feels dealing with someone who cannot pretend to be his friend is his only chance.At this point, the film takes off, thanks to a lot of action and to the cat and mouse game between the two negotiators. For about an hour, the faulty plot premise is forgotten. It comes back to haunt us at the end of the film, but that hour is worth a viewing. It's fast and suspenseful.Sometimes, using two extremely good actors in a badly constructed work creates a paradox. Their performances make the movie worth seeing, but they also serve to put a spotlight on the story's weaknesses. This is especially true for Jackson, whose character violently takes the law into his own hands. This happened to him in the absurd ""A Time to Kill"". At least in that case he played a farmer who knew nothing of the intricacies of the law. In ""The Negotiator"" he's a college-educated police officer. Even worse, we are expected to believe that such potentially lethal action can take someone back to where they were before all the bad things happened.

107157,A16EZ4MT9BFF2R,0790739739,Mike Murray,"[3, 4]","[Add a half-star if, in your mind, acting can overcome a ludicrous script.]I couldn't wait to see this film.  It has all the ingredients I could hope for, especially two of America's finest actors today: Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey.  It has a fine supporting cast:  David Morse, John Spencer, Ron Rifkin, Paul Giamatti, Regina Taylor and the late J.T. Walsh.  And, it has a superb back-story.The film opens with a Chicago police precient dealing with a hostage situation.  A man, a former Marine, is holding hostage his daughter (step-daughter?) with the aim of forcing his wife (ex-wife?) to come watch him blow his brains out.  One of the men forced to deal with this explosive situation is police Lt. Danny Roman (Jackson) who is doing his best to take the man out before the SWAT team headed by Cmdr. Adam Beck (Morse) does it by storming the apartment.  Eventually, Roman talks his way into the apartment and defuses the situation with a little assist from his SWAT buddies.  This scene is excellent because it gives us an excellent overview of the abilities of Roman as one of Chicago's top hostage negotiators, the delicate and unstable balance between talking to a perpetrator and brute force tactics, and it sets up the relationship between Roman and his partner, Nate (Paul Guilfoyle).What follows is the inevitable publicity and celebration that another sticky situation was resolved without much bloodshed or loss of life and more development of the relationship between Roman and his colleagues.  However, in the middle of the celebration, Nate has some important news for Danny... news he's been trying to tell Danny for a couple of days, it turns out.It seems Nate has stumbled onto a scam to bilk the policeman's disability fund of money.  Nate has been investigating and he's learned that cops are behind the scam -- some of the same cops that Nate and Danny work with.  Nate wants to tell Danny more, but they're interrupted so he defers the balance of the talk until later.  Some hours later, Danny gets a page asking him to meet Nate and he rushes out for the meet.  We then see Nate in his car waiting to meet Danny and then something happens.  Nate looks at &lt;em&gt;HIS&lt;/em&gt; pager to see what time Danny asked for the meet.  This telegraphs to us that something is very wrong.  Nate looks up and sees (obviously) a familiar face and starts to talk to him only to have his brains blown out in the driver's seat.  The unknown figure leaves and Danny drives up and discovers his partner's body.OK.  So far, so good.  However, from here, the script starts to sink into oblivion.  Screenwriters James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox would have us believe that Roman would blurt out the details of everything his partner told him to the now-suspect co-workers.  Beyond that, we have Nate's funeral and a subsequent investigation where all evidence leads to Roman, who happens to be on the board of the disability fund.Roman is stripped of his badge, his gun and his dignity and he makes a last-ditch attempt to get his colleagues to investigate themselves.  He gets no assistance and so he dispatches his wife and heads back upstairs because he &quot;forgot&quot; something.  Upstairs, he walks in on Internal Affairs Insp. Terence Niebaum (Walsh) whom Nate implicated as involved in the scam.  Eventually, Niebaum, his secretary, and a police informant (Giamatti) are taken hostage along with precient cmdr. Frost (Rifkin) who, as Danny's friend and colleague, tried to talk him out of the hostage situation and ends up being taken hostage himself.Notice that no where in the story so far have I mention Kevin Spacey's character.  It's taken us about an hour to get to this point, which in and of itself is no problem.  The problem is F. Gary Gray's (Set It Off) direction doesn't maintain the dramatic tension necessary to keep us squirming in our seats for the right reason.  We should be squirming because of dramatic tension on the screen.  Instead we're squirming because we're wondering if it's OK to go get another tub of popcorn before something starts happening.Roman, as hostage taker and as an ace negotiator, knows how to control the situation and that is shown to us in a hilarious but tense scene between he and Farley, the rookie negotiator brought in to deal with the situation.  Roman ends up demanding that a negotiator from another precient be brought in to talk and it is then that we are finally introduced to Chris Sabien (Spacey).  We're given a quick back-story on Sabien that gives us some insight into his character and then we're off to the races.The Negotiator is set up to be a thinking man's action film and it succeeds mostly because of its cast.  It takes some incredulous material and makes the best of the situation.  Kudos to Jackson and Spacey for doing what they always do well.  They are two of the best actors on the planet and we are lucky to have them here.  David Morse as Beck and Regina Taylor as Roman's newlywed wife, Karen, are also superb.  Although I've been down on the film for most of this essay, there are some surprises: some dramatic, some silly, and others just plain ludicrous.  However, when the movie works, it works because of the skill of the actors.As a matinee or a video, The Negotiator isn't a bad way to spend a couple of hours.[Originally rated 3 October

I believe they meant Chicago North, which here in the Windy City is how it appears on newscasts, or we just say north side. In reality, we usually name the neighborhood. Okay, that's a simple, forgivable error probably because the writers have only ever spent a layover night at the O'Hare Hilton and that's the closest they got to Chicago.There are many larger, glaring errors. One being that as large as Chicago is, I don't even know if our police department has a full-time negotiator on staff let alone two. If we do, it's just one, and chances are that is not hiss full time job. We just like to shoot people on the street here, hostage-taking is fairly rare. But a bigger error...the FBI has NO jurisdiction in local police affairs so their presence in the film is bizarre, and ultimately useless, what my friend calls a plot cactus: seems to present conflict for a moment, then nothing (it's like off-roading in the desert and hitting a small cactus).The police procedure shown in almost every step of the film is not only completely wrong when compared to reality, but not even fitting with typical TV/movie tropes.Also, I won't give any spoilers, but most of the ""what just happened?"" McGuffins that mark a good thriller are absent or horribly done.

107161,A1RZ1KIP4LJYDZ,0790739739,"moviefreak ""moviefreak2003""","[1, 5]","Let's face it. The Negotiator is not the best action thriller around. If you are looking for a movie with a lot of action (by that I mean fist-fights, shootouts, and explosions), then this is not the movie for you. The Negotiator is more of a physocological thriller with several bad twists and some good unexpected turns. Though it features a good cast, the story lacks intensity and the script is too long. The Negotiator quickly pulls us in from the beginning and then wastes a good 75 minutes showing how Samuel L. Jackson hijacks a building and takes hostages and then makes his amazing escape. Plot twists like this are horrible because they keep sticking on one main idea, and then BAAM!, the whole concept of the movie switches over. Though supported with a good cast and some good turns, the Negotiator is something you should probably rent before buying.The Negotiator tells the story of Danny Roman (Jackson), a cop from Chicago who learns from his partner that several cops from his group are stealing money from the police fund. But before Jackson could deep digger into the mystery, his partner is brutally murdered and Roman is framed for it. Left with no choice but to prove himself innocent, Roman hijacks a police building. He calls on negotiator Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), to help him but for at least half of the movie, we do not know what side Spacey is on. Anyway, the battle soon begins as Roman takes on Sabian in a battle of intelligence. But will Roman have enough time to prove his innocence? As I stated before, the Negotiator is not a must-buy. Catch it on TV some time or rent it but its not worth it. It was a bit boring the first time I watched it.

At points it gets a little tricky to keep the good guys and bad guys sorted out.  Overall I would rate this as a highly enjoyable movie, primarily on the strength of the performances by Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey.  Both of them do a bang-up job (no pun intended).Jackson plays Danny Roman, a good cop who is falsely accused of skimming from the police pension fund.  When the frame-up looks too solid to escape, Roman resorts to taking some hostages at the police station to buy the two things he needs the most -- the time and the information to prove his innocence.  He begins to interrogate some of the hostages, several of whom are close friends, and to pick information from some sensitive computer files.  Gradually he begins to uncover an ugly conspiracy involving corruption at various levels of the police department, but every question he answers seems to lead to two more.In the meantime, the police respond to the hostage crisis and call in expert hostage negotiator Chris Sabian (played by Spacey) to &quot;talk down&quot; the apparently volatile Danny Roman.  While Roman is predictably cast as a very sympathetic character, Sabian remains an unknown factor until the very end of the movie, a consummate professional whose loyalties and intentions can never quite be pinpointed.  Roman is never sure from one moment to the next if Sabian is ally or enemy.As the movie progresses, there are a number of action sequences of increasing intensity as those behind the corruption conspiracy make one attempt after another to silence Roman while his credibility is still worthless and before his discoveries can be made public.  These efforts are not lost on Sabian, who starts to think that there may be some fire behind Roman's smoke, but still never cuts Roman any slack.I don't want to spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it, but let it suffice to say that it had a suspenseful and unexpected twist that kept the with spirit of the rest of the movie.  Needless to say, the good guys win, but I'm not going to drop any hints about how.  You'll have to watch it for yourself, but I can say with some confidence that you'll be glad you did.

Jackson), a police negotiator, and his partner Nate Roenick (Paul Guilfoyle) discover that someone has been embezzling money from the police retirement fund.  When Nate is killed, Danny is set up with planted evidence to take the fall on the embezzlement charges.When Danny confronts Inspector Terence Neibaum (J.T. Walsh), who works in Internal Affairs, trying to find out why he is being set up, things get out of hand and Danny winds out taking Neibaum and his entire office hostage.  Danny insists on speaking only with Lt. Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), a police negotiator from a west side precinct who is unknown to their department.  Danny's hopes are that with Chris being an outsider, he can help him discover the truth behind the bad cops in his department that killed his partner.What follows is a tense thriller as step by step, Danny gets closer to the truth behind the very people he has known and worked with for over ten years, building up to a rather predictable and yet intensely climactic ending.The performances by Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey are as good as it gets, backed by terrific supporting roles from David Morse, J.T. Walsh, Siobhan Fallon, Paul Giamatti, and Michael Cudlitz.The Negotiator stands out amongst other movies of it's genre because of it's tight scripting, excellent editing and photography, and the obvious fact that the actors involved were working as a close team.

Suffice it to say that this film is well done, tense and draws you in. I only review the quality of the Blu Ray disc itself. I do not have the Standard Def version so this is also not a comparison between the two formats.The film itself is pretty old but retains its legs and tenseness throughout. The video transfer to blu ray displays a warm color grading with realistic skin tones. It definitely has a filmic look though I noticed no rough grain in any part of the film. Contrast and resolution were just fine though I do not know how much of an improvement the blu ray transfer displays over the standard definition version. I saw no artifacts or aliasing anywhere and the film was easy on the eyes.The audio is the star with lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 and there is a goodly amount of appropriate panning between the front and rear sound stages as well as discreet usage of your 5 channels in terms of proper directionality of foley fx. The sub LFE channel is also used but is not omnipresent in any way. While the gunshots and flash bombs create some needed bottom end, it doesn't go down all that deep. One thing I noticed, it seemed to me that the audio levels in the transfer were a touch low. I usually set my processor for the home theater to 61 but noticed that some of the quieter dialogue was difficult to hear so I upped the volume to 64 (about 3db) and all was fine from that point on. I did not have to go back to reset the volume at any point.There are a couple of good extras. One is an interview with a real L.A. negotiator that really is far too short. Another extra discusses why Chicago was chosen as a city for the film and interviews several on the crew who were instrumental with various aspects of the production.Since I do not have the Standard Def version I really can't say how much of an improvement this Blu Ray is over the SD DVD. However, the film is a good one and is well worth having especially considering the low price.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summariesThanks",4,The Negotiator on Blu Ray,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,2256,"['wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'summary', 'plot', 'opinions', 'acting', 'comparison', 'original', 'movie', 'Suffice', 'say', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'tense', 'draws', 'only', 'review', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'so', 'also', 'not', 'comparison', 'two', 'formats.The', 'film', 'pretty', 'old', 'legs', 'tenseness', 'video', 'transfer', 'blu', 'ray', 'warm', 'color', 'grading', 'realistic', 'skin', 'tones', 'definitely', 'filmic', 'look', 'noticed', 'rough', 'grain', 'part', 'film', 'Contrast', 'resolution', 'were', 'just', 'fine', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'improvement', 'blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'standard', 'definition', 'version', 'saw', 'artifacts', 'aliasing', 'anywhere', 'film', 'was', 'easy', 'eyes.The', 'audio', 'star', 'lossless', 'Dolby', 'True', 'HD', '5.1', 'goodly', 'amount', 'appropriate', 'panning', 'front', 'rear', 'sound', 'stages', 'as', 'well', 'discreet', 'usage', '5', 'channels', 'terms', 'proper', 'directionality', 'foley', 'fx', 'sub', 'LFE', 'channel', 'also', 'used', 'not', 'omnipresent', 'way', 'gunshots', 'flash', 'bombs', 'create', 'needed', 'bottom', 'end', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'deep', 'One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'seemed', 'audio', 'levels', 'transfer', 'were', 'touch', 'low', 'usually', 'set', 'processor', 'home', 'theater', '61', 'noticed', 'quieter', 'dialogue', 'was', 'difficult', 'hear', 'so', 'upped', 'volume', '64', '3db', 'was', 'fine', 'point', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'reset', 'volume', 'are', 'couple', 'good', 'extras', 'One', 'interview', 'real', 'L.A.', 'negotiator', 'really', 'far', 'too', 'short', 'extra', 'discusses', 'why', 'Chicago', 'was', 'chosen', 'city', 'film', 'interviews', 'several', 'crew', 'who', 'were', 'instrumental', 'various', 'aspects', 'production.Since', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'much', 'improvement', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'SD', 'DVD', 'However', 'film', 'good', 'one', 'well', 'worth', 'having', 'especially', 'considering', 'low', 'price.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summariesThanks']",N/A

Only if you cast them  as bushes.The movie begins with a negotiation that takes all of fifteen  minutes, to set you up for the negotiation that will last the rest of the  movie. Samuel L. Jackson is a wrongly accused negotiator (a top-notch one)  who uncovers a corrupt cop ring, and in desperation, takes several people  hostage to discover the truth. This is just one brilliantly ironic idea: a  negotiator taking people hostage. Of course, then, there are the great  scenes where Jackson mocks the negotiator trying to talk him down. There is  also another great scene where he discusses how you can tell someone is  lying. Well, eventually, we get Kevin Spacey, another top-notch negotiator  who steals every scene he's in, unless he's in it with Jackson, in which  case they tie. And then the movie really kicks off. You're in for some  surprises. While the conspiracy is sometimes hard to follow, none of the  tenseness is lost. Intermittently, we get some action sequences to liven  things up a bit, which keeps the movie from becoming too slow-paced.

Walsh.Running Time:  135 minutes.Rated R for violence and language.When the director has the lucky chance to work with not just one, but TWO of the most exceptional modern actions of the past decade, he should have been licking his chops in anticipation.  Director F. Gary Gray (whose previous work was with Ice Cube and Chris Tucker in &quot;Friday&quot;) uses the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey to his advantage, creating a fast-paced action-drama that uses both actors as chess pieces that are intertwined in a suspenseful race against time.Jackson stars as an extremely successful hostage negotiatior who loses his partner in an accident.  When he is framed for the accident as murder, he takes matters into his own hands by taking hostages himself.  Kevin Spacey is the top-of-the-line officer assigned to assist the police department with consultations with Jackson, only to find himself in the most unique hostate situation he has ever encountered.  Both must learn to trust each other, with Jackson attempting to find the true answers about his partner's death and Spacey trying to keep his incredible reputation in tact.Gray does a fine job using the intense script (which unfortunately does have a few logical lapses), producing a motion picture that possesses all the essential ingredients to be a successful and enteraining flick.
