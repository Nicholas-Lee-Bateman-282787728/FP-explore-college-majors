1157998,A27M94VLNMBYGE,B0017VG67C,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Volume four takes the viewer through the last six episodes of the Avatar cartoon series. Avatar has been a quality cartoon from day one, and does not disappoint: if you keep in mind that is a cartoon, and nothing more.In the Southern Raiders, Katara and Zuko take a trip to confront the demons of her past. Katara is forced to choose her path, and goes through some character growth here. Zuko's response to it in the end delivers a question Aang can't answer.In the Ember Island Players, the kids watch a play chronicling their journey. They each (well, except Tuff) see a piece of themselves they're not entirely comfortable with. No one except Aang seems to do much soul-searching over it, so its value is only in poking fun at the main characters, which I actually enjoyed.Sozin's Comet is a four-part episode. Aang agonizes yet again. Everyone says he has to kill the Firelord, which goes against everything he's ever been taught. He goes off on his own to meditate. Everyone looks for him. Yeah, I know, we've seen this before.Aang gets alot of advice he doesn't particularly like, but comes to accept. Meanwhile, the other kids prioritize, and get their acts together to do something about the Firelord's plans.When the Firelord comes knocking, Aang is ready to face him. Here we see Aang (and bending in general) doing things we've never seen him do. He comes into his own as the Avatar. Even before going into the Avatar state, he shows that he really is a master of the four elements. It's a cartoon, but it's cool. Meanwhile, Zuko and Azula go at it.Aang goes into the Avatar state and unleashes hell. Then he does something even all the avatars of the past didn't know was possible. Katara pulls a final trick out of thin air and shows herself a true master of waterbending.There is rarely a cartoon that comes along and pulls me in like this. Entertaining, clean, action-oriented fun that anyone in the family can watch. The characters grow in skill and maturity throughout the series, and the stakes keep climbing, right up to the end. I give this conclusion four stars.",4,Closure,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,2084,"['Volume', 'four', 'viewer', 'last', 'six', 'episodes', 'Avatar', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Avatar', 'been', 'quality', 'cartoon', 'day', 'one', 'not', 'disappoint', 'keep', 'mind', 'cartoon', 'nothing', 'more.In', 'Southern', 'Raiders', 'Katara', 'Zuko', 'take', 'trip', 'confront', 'demons', 'past', 'Katara', 'forced', 'choose', 'path', 'character', 'growth', 'here', 'Zuko', 'response', 'end', 'question', 'Aang', 'ca', ""n't"", 'answer.In', 'Ember', 'Island', 'Players', 'kids', 'watch', 'play', 'chronicling', 'journey', 'well', 'Tuff', 'see', 'piece', ""'re"", 'not', 'entirely', 'comfortable', 'one', 'Aang', 'do', 'much', 'soul-searching', 'value', 'only', 'poking', 'fun', 'main', 'characters', 'actually', 'enjoyed.Sozin', 'Comet', 'four-part', 'episode', 'Aang', 'yet', 'again', 'Everyone', 'kill', 'Firelord', 'everything', 'ever', 'been', 'taught', 'off', 'own', 'meditate', 'Everyone', 'Yeah', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.Aang', 'alot', 'advice', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'like', 'accept', 'Meanwhile', 'other', 'kids', 'prioritize', 'get', 'acts', 'together', 'do', 'something', 'Firelord', 'plans.When', 'Firelord', 'knocking', 'Aang', 'ready', 'face', 'Here', 'see', 'Aang', 'bending', 'general', 'doing', 'things', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'do', 'own', 'Avatar', 'Even', 'going', 'Avatar', 'state', 'really', 'master', 'four', 'elements', 'cartoon', 'cool', 'Meanwhile', 'Zuko', 'Azula', 'go', 'it.Aang', 'Avatar', 'state', 'unleashes', 'hell', 'Then', 'something', 'even', 'avatars', 'past', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'possible', 'Katara', 'final', 'trick', 'thin', 'air', 'true', 'master', 'waterbending.There', 'rarely', 'cartoon', 'along', 'pulls', 'Entertaining', 'clean', 'action-oriented', 'fun', 'anyone', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'characters', 'grow', 'skill', 'maturity', 'series', 'stakes', 'keep', 'climbing', 'right', 'end', 'give', 'conclusion', 'four', 'stars']","Avatar The Last Airbender - Book 3 Fire, Vol. 4"

1158001,A32Y55Z00QI12S,B0017VG67C,ARK,"[2, 4]","Rather solid, but merely average.  The final showdown is not the epic conclusion I expected, but at least it doesn't sputter out completely.  I'd say this final collection is a moderate success.The one thing that really bugs me about these episodes -- and about the last season in general -- is that they just CHARGE for the ending with little to no build-up.  This is a shame, since it's that build-up that made the first season so epic in scale, and also since they waste their time with a lot of filler episodes when they could have been building up the plot and characterization in those time-slots.Chapter 16: The Southern Raiders.  Zuko and Katara soar off on Appa to find Katara's mother's killer. (Speaking of Appa... with all these nightly excursions, the poor guy hasn't had a full night's rest in a year!)  There are some just ""sweet"" battle scenes in this one; you've gotta see what Katara does with raindrops.Cons involve a host of small, niggling concerns.  For one thing, the way they're able to float around the world so quickly, you'd think it was the size of a football field.  And, although I entirely agree with Aang's statement that revenge gains nothing, I could only roll my eyes as he talked; the preaching only made the episode feel like a morality play than actual entertainment.  Also, Katara's goody-two-shoes melodrama couldn't be worn more thin by now.I'm fine with filler episodes -- if they're good.  It was as though they were grasping for ideas in these, and I question why they were made when there were plenty of other more nagging plot holes to fill.  This ep was more boring than anything else; if anything, it cheapened the way the first season spoke of Katara's mother's death.  I imagined something a bit more epic along the lines of, say, a Viking raid against a relatively harmless monastery in the Middle Ages, and many deaths.  But this was no raid -- how could it be when ONLY Katara's mother dies?  That's not a raid, that's assassination.It's almost goofy, the way they ""misuse"" words in this series to amp up events that really aren't that big (e.g., ""invasion"" at the beginning of Season 3, when it was just twenty guys lobbing rocks and peanut sauce).  I suppose it wasn't the creators' faults; after the first season, it seemed Nickelodeon laid down the law and death was downplayed dramatically.  Thing is, that's what initially attracted me to the series -- its maturity and willingness to face death head-on!  Of course, by now, such maturity is utterly lost.Chapter 17: The Ember Island Players. In a word: UGH. It's embarrassing.  The only redeeming quality is Toph; I guarantee that you'll laugh your lungs out at the super-sonic screaming.  Now, I know what the producers were going for here (a self-aware commentary filling new viewers in about past events and making statements about its fandom), but it's just lame, sad, and just a bit pretentious.This episode could have been so, so hilarious and entertaining in many other ways.  What if it were real, honest-to-goodness Fire Nation propaganda, demonizing the Avatar, making him and his friends look like criminals, getting events wrong, and making things up? This would have been a more realistic approach, and it would have been more revealing and entertaining, too.  As it was, it was just another really lame filler episode.  I can't tell you how many times my friends and I groaned and covered our faces during this one.  Whatever you do, don't introduce your friends to Avatar with this.Chapter 18-21: Sozin's Comet. Parts 1-4: The Phoenix King, The Old Masters, Into the Inferno, Avatar Aang.  Perhaps it is best to treat this as one whole episode.  This final grouping was all right; on a first viewing marathon-style, it manages to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Afterward, why would you ever want to watch it again?  As other reviewers have so aptly stated, many plot threads remain dangling.  As others have NOT stated, much of it is downright boring and slow-paced with no reward.  It feels more like fluffy filler than the satisfactory meat of a plot.  Aang constantly whining about facing off with the Fire Lord was realistic, but irritating and hypocritical; Aang HAS killed somebody, and rather nastily, too.  Admiral Zhao, anybody?  Speaking of Zhao, forget pacifism and political correctness, I wanted a smack-down along the lines of the final two episodes of the first season!At first, I loved the idea of Aang going to this ""mysterious"" island and conferring with his past lives.  However, there's no payoff; it's irritating that Aang won't listen to them.  The ""wise words"" of the Lionturtle weren't actually wise as much as they were gobbledygook, and you can't even understand him the first time you hear him.  In fact, even when you DO finally understand him, you realize that he says something entirely DIFFERENT in the final episode when Aang bends the Fire Lord.  So what was the point in the first Lionturtle exposition?  To sound smart, I suppose.  If you wanted some closure in that episode, you would have been disappointed.Also, for those of you who like hilarious, goofy lines that should never have been written: the Fire Lord's big plan is to remove the Earth Nation's (wait for it!) ""hopes.""  (Snerk!)  Then he starts removing those hopes by burning an uninhabited forest, and only attacks with like... twelve airships.  The whole continent's population could simply move to the other side while he got finished burning one half, and then move back as he made his second and third circuits.  It's ridiculous.The unbinding of the 7th Chakra was lame, as was the whole fight with the Fire Lord.  There's some flying... lots of flying.  And punching.  And some fire.  Aang running like a wussy.  Yawn.  Aang's flying, I understand; the retarded Fire Nation version of flying, with rocket-powered fists, should never, ever have been invented. (Everyone in the household sniggers every time someone lifts off with fire shooting from fists and feet like a human space shuttle.)  The fighting only pays off in the latter half, when Aang enters the Avatar State and starts kicking the Fire Lord around like a rag doll.However, if you want to see something awesome, Azula's unraveling and eventual madness is downright sweet and can't be missed.  I would have liked to see it more spread out, as the madness occurs so quickly that it's easy to misunderstand why it occurs.  Ironically, the fight that cannot be missed in this DVD set is not that between Aang and Ozai, but the Agni Kai between Azula and Zuko.  The soft, understated music, the muted sounds of fire and shouting, gives me chills every time -- even when I think about it.  In fact, during Aang's fight with the Fire Lord, I was waiting breathlessly to return to the Agni Kai.Aang's final KO of the Fire Lord is anti-climactic.  Just think: if Zuko hadn't taken over at home, the Mind-Bending would have been for naught (there's still Azula to contend with).  Furthermore, the Fire Lord's still the leader of the darn country, firebender or no.  So it really wasn't a very satisfying ending, all things considered.  It just seemed... mushy.  Rushed. Uneven. Anti-climactic.  Still, at least the Fire Lord got his comeuppance.Finally, the final kiss is just... ugh.  That romance never, ever made sense to me; you know how 12-year-olds approach romance?  Not very seriously, right?  And you know how big that gap looks between you and a kid one mere grade above you?  Yeah.  That's why this relationship creeps me out.  Katara is almost robbing the cradle.  The romance is displayed as something ""lasting"" and central when it is just goofy and awkward and has no grounds in reality.  In a year they'll both hate each other.All things considered, this set contains some rather awkward and unsatisfying episodes... a lot of filler, a rushed plot and characterization.  It's mostly tepid.  You can still find some real gems in there, though -- some beautiful fight scenes, hilarious dialogue, and wonderful ideas.  You'll thrill at the sight of the giant Lionturtle.  You'll adore the fight scenes and Toph's ""Iron Man.""  You'll giggle at the romance between Sokka and Tsuki.  But you'll probably only watch this DVD once a year or during an Avatar marathon... it's just not very satisfying or half as interesting as previous episodes.",3,"No Epic Conclusion, but Not Complete

I've so enjoyed the entire Avatar series with my kids and have been amazed as to the depth the writers have put into it. At first glance it might look like just another cute kids anime cartoon but on closer examination I found wonderful examples of interpersonal relating, forgiveness, inner healing, anger management, trust of self and of soul predispositions & healing. I noted one of the most simple, elegant, yet complete expressions of the chakra system in a way that kids could begin to understand their emotional state of being and how this interacts with the body's energy centers as well as subtle suggestion as to how to begin the path to being balanced and free of emotional baggage yet rich in energy and expression... So much more.While I understand that some of strong religious devotion may see some of this content as evil or bad, I personally found it refreshing, very much about balance, healing and learning to truly Be a heart based human, not just act like one, so many encouragements to real authenticity...

This is the last disc in the first series, last season - there is a new Avatar series out that takes place 70 after the end of this one. I haven't seen the new one yet and don't know if it is as good. I like the ending of the series (spoilers) because Aang doesn't kill the Fire Lord. I think that it teaches kids there are better ways of dealing with problems rather than the obvious ones. The characters are all loveable and tend to have more depth than traditional animated characters for younger children.

That was filled with so much pwnage.There were several things in this DVD that were one-star for me. Mind you, this is a commentary only on the episodes this DVD, not the rest of the series.- The ending with the kisses. Ruined it for me, really. There should have been no kissing, it just added kitschiness to the whole ending and felt forced.- Plot inconsistencies within the last few episodes (Ember Island Players, Southern Raiders) It feels to me that the writers simply weren't paying attention and didn't care to tighten up the plot.- Many questions left unanswered. The fate of Ursa? Long Feng? The Earth King? The White Lotus? Chit Sang? Teo? Again, it feels like the writers got sloppy. Tsk tsk...Other than that, the eps were decent. Good animation, and plot holes aside, there were humorous/memorable moments. So overall, when you add the good stuff and bad stuff, this particular set of episodes gets 3/5 stars.
