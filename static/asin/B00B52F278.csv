1621870,A3J1L5HC0RMCDX,B00B52F278,"Anonymous45 ""michael cifelli""","[1, 1]","This will be a review to clear up peoples questions. I will not go into the plots, twists, who stays and who leaves, or who lives and who dies. Essentially, before watching this series you should google Spartacus and get an idea on the story. That is all you need to know before seeing this series. I will also warn you that this is by far the most bloodiest series I have seen in years. But it is all in the context of what the Gladiator's are trained and purchased for. This is all needed. I will also warn you that if you are turned off by soft porn or strong sexual content? This comes as close or even more than anything you will see on late night on Showtime or Cinemax. And may not be for you. Now that being said, I have not seen a series that is anywhere near as great as this epic 4 season series.First, there are 4 seasons. The first season is called Spartacus: Blood and Sand. The actor who originally plays Spartacus is named Andy Whitfield and I am very sorry to say after this season he passed away from cancer. The link is [...] if you wish to see who he was. I do have to say it was a bit tough to take to his replacement later on as he was really loved. But it did not take long to fall in love with his character again even with a new actor by the name of Liam McIntyre who does an outstanding job playing Spartacus. After Blood and Sand was done they came up with a prequel called Spartacus: Gods of the Arena. This was 10 episodes long and it shows what events take place before Spartacus arrives and the circumstances in which he finds himself training to be a Gladiator. I will say this was not what he wanted, and the idea of Freedom is a theme that pounds away at you through the whole series due to his new surroundings. So in the Prequel Gods of the Arena, the Champion of the house is called Gannicus. For you ladies, I would suggest you google him....His real name is Dustin Clare and some feel he stole the show with his performance.I can tell you events in each film but it will really ruin it for you. So after this prequel &#34;Gods of the Arena&#34;, the next season is called Spartacus: Vengeance. Now this is where the original actor who played Spartacus was replaced. Again the actor who took this role is named Liam McIntyre and he does a brilliant job from start to the last episode and the conclusion of the series. The 4th and final season is called Spartacus: War of the Damned. Which is what I am suppose to be reviewing. In this last installment, they bring back many of the characters I have not mentioned that you will grow to love and root for which makes the last season War of the Damned brilliant and on your seat waiting for days to pass by so you can get to the next episode. In addition to the character Gannicus who plays in &#34;The Gods of the Arena&#34;, the prequel, there is another character I should have mentioned sooner. The character's name is Crixus played by Manu Bennett. He is just as important and amazing as anyone in a lead acting role and in all great series or films, The Hero Spartacus also has to have a counter part to argue and fight with. You will enjoy this character Crixus and the evolution of his character through out his time in the series. In the final season &#34;The War of The Damned&#34;, Spartacus faces his most intelligent and fierce opponent from the Roman Army, called Crassus played by Simon Merrells. Spartacus and Crassus att odds and destine to face each other, one fighting for glory of the Republic of Rome and the other Spartacus, the fight For freedom not just for Gladiator's, but for all woman, men, and humanity. The story just builds up until the last episode.You can google &#34;Starz Spartacus Series&#34; and read about the characters and the story lines if you wish. I gave everyone the names of each series as they aired in order to clear up the confusion. So in telling you what it is all about and giving details and maybe hurting your experience, I will just say that I personally loved this series and it is one of my favorites I have ever seen. If you liked Braveheart, and Gladiator? This is a little like those great films but way more violent, and a ton more sexual content. Not good for children, or even teenagers depending on your flexibility with what age you allow your children to watch Rated R, to soft porn? This is in my humble opinion just for adults only. So just a friendly warning. So everyone asking for the 4th series? You have them all named in here. Spartacus : War of the Damned being the last season. It has everything you could think of or want. Themes of love, hate, Slaves, Freedom with the highest cost, bonds of brotherhood, the complexity of the time period, family dynamics and bonds between fathers and sons, Sacrifice and finally betrayal. It has everything you want in this type of genre of film. There are so many characters I did not mention or we would be here all day. I hope if you love these types of movies you will give this a chance. You will be taken in from the very first episode. They waste no time in any episode moving this along. I loved it and I continue to watch it over and over. Start with the first season Spartacus: Blood and Sand. You will not stop watching I promise you. Worth every dime. Hope this helped and cleared things up for everyone who were confused on how many seasons and why. Enjoy......",5,One of the Best Epic Series Of All Time,1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,5372,"['will', 'be', 'review', 'clear', 'up', 'peoples', 'questions', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'plots', 'twists', 'who',

Crassus is a more worthy opponent to the clever hero, and he has nearly as many tricks up his sleeve as Spartacus. In addition he's aided by a young and impetuous Julius Caesar, who sneaks in to the rebel camp and acts as a spy. Brilliant.All of the acting is sublime -- not a bad performance anywhere. Liam McIntyre manages to embody a man who kills for a living and a hobby, yet still seems the most humane person in the room.

Don't even get me started on season two&#8212;or you can read my pretty negative review if you wish.The cause, I think, is a chopped budget and the fact that de Knight was not as inivolved in writing. Big events and big characters are crammed into a small space and truncated timeline. Neither characters nor events are developed to their fullest. It is such a disappointment to see a series that started with such potential and audience support end on a whimper because of short sighted management.I find no fault with the acting, however.

1621894,A2TDIFABWXWNNP,B00B52F278,David L. Bullock,"[93, 105]","Along with the Walking Dead, this was my favorite series. As much as I loved Andy Whitfield (God bless him and his family), I must say Liam McIntyre was equally outstanding and perhaps even more. It is a bit like comparing your favorite James Bond -- Sean Connery or Roger Moore. All are outstanding and render their own interpretations. I am a PhD in European Military History and approve of this series in the way that they rendered history. We all could have small quibbles about this and that, that the Romans always threw pila (special spears) before closing, that Onamaeus was really a Gaul, not a black man...but what a character he was anyway. The cause of liberty should embrace all human kind and the scriptwriters were courageous and inclusive in making this point. Crixus and Gannicus did exist, the former as a Gaul and the latter as a Celt. Since nothing more is known about them, the scriptwriters were open to their interpretations. Of the three primary accounts about Spartacus, two say he died on the battlefield, and one says the body was never found. This series took the latter interpretation and thereby provided a beautiful ending. The final season seemed a bit compressed compared to the season right before it, but the producers had decided to wind the series down. Another two seasons clearly could have been done. I personally found the acting, the characters (without exception) and the scriptwriters to be outstanding. Some reviewers have commented about the gay characters and scenes. I am a definitely ""straight"" Independent Conservative and did not like the first series scenes between Barca and Pietro mostly because I did not like them as men. Agron and Nasir were different because I liked them as men. As an ex-military officer, I would have been proud to stand beside them in battle and share their table.

1621902,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B00B52F278,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[2, 4]","AlongsideThe Tudors: The Complete Series, this is one of the most well done & ambitious series ever produced by  a premium movie channel.  Unlike Henry the VIII, however, there are far more missing details to the life of Spartacus.  We really don't have any idea of what went on within the Thracian's camp as we don't have any 1st hand accounts.  Everything we know, we only know from the Roman point-of-view.This is both good & bad.  While we don't know the names of the gladiators & other Roman slaves who fought with Spartacus, I can't help but think that this series is an excellent REPRESENTATION of the types of discussions that must have transpired inside of Spartacus' inner-circle.  The series brings these long-dead heroes to life, and that is precisely the point.Liberties are taken with the one Gauis Julius Caesar, but that is all well & good as he's one of the few historical figures in the series (aside from Spartacus himself) who is a household name.  Meanwhile, the depictions of Crassus & Pompey are historically accurate, at least in the broad historical sense.  Marcus Crassus DID resort to decimating his own men, and Crassus & Pompey did team-up to defeat the gladiator army.  {As a sidenote, the 3 men together would go on to form what would become known as the ""First Triumverate"" which was a sort of bridge between the Roman Republic & the age of the Caesars}The acting in the series is terrific, with two alumni from the movie ""300"" included.  Both genders are bound to be entranced as the series is filled to top with buffed up gladiators & gorgeous women.  Of the latter, Gwendoline Taylor debuts in this season as Sibyl.  I must say, I was absolutely mesmerized by this New Zealand beauty!!  I can't wait to see her in more projects.The SPARTACUS series invokes everything that the time period was famous (or infamous?) for:  gladiatorial games, Roman baths, orgies, torture / crucifixion and the Romans trying to impose their will on the rest of the world.  As such, the series does not pull any punches when it comes to violence, blood, gore & nudity (in fact, virtually every single actress in the series strips-down @ one time or other!).  People who want their history watered down into a ""G Rated"" version should look elsewhere.This is a spectacular series, one that belongs up there with other Roman epics such asBen Hur (1959),GladiatorandI, Claudius (35th Anniversary Edition).  People who want to learn more about the Roman empire would be inclined to also pick upRome Power & Glory: The Rise.In the present age, the motto of the United States Army GREEN BERETS is ""To free the oppressed.""  Spartacus would have smiled upon such a motto.  That we still have brave soldiers today who wish to eradicate slavery and human hardship is a testament to the human will to resist tyranny.  It is also a testament to Spartacus himself:  a man who went on to become much more legendary than the 2 Legates who ultimately defeated him.

So let me skip to season three, and say as a dedicated fan from the very first episode, it's still a great show. Um, and it's still gay porn. Yeah, OK, there's naked women, too, (like one for every three naked men,) but that's not why I watch this show. No...not for the nude men, either, (I heard you thinking that you pervert!) Just kidding. You're not a pervert if you watch any of these shows. Like I said in my first review of season one, despite the porn, (the GAY porn,) it's still one hell of a great show.I'm a lover of anything Roman Empire. I'm not a youngster anymore, and I don't get thrills from seeing nude women. (Never was thrilled about nude men.) But the cast and the production and the writing and the everything over the top works for this show. Yes, even the porn. Or is it porn? Hey, I don't look too carefully, it's like I don't hit pause and study the naked actors or actresses, I mean, but I'd swear those are fake bushes on those nude women. I mean in season three, especially. It sure looks like those are female pubic hair toupees, if you will. And I've read several comments that the male members are prosthetics, too. But that's not the point. I don't care about any of that.What I do care about is a punk teenager, (son of Crassus,) raping Julius Caesar. I mean, come on. Yeah, I know the producers are taking liberties, and even though Caesar had no historical participation in the Spartacus wars, they thought it would be a good idea to include him. But as this punk's biatch? Now, you're talking perverted. But you know what? According to the writings of Gaius Marius, any type of homosexuality in the legions was a capital crime. So that's taking their ""liberties"" a little too far. But they're taking everything too far. And like I said many times, and in many different ways, it works for this show. Spartacus will be missed. At least I'll miss it. Until the next Roman historical show comes on. Maybe that show about Leonardo will be good. I'll be watching it.

1621921,A3G7W5O2OX8MTC,B00B52F278,"Grey ""b09boy""","[14, 27]","Spartacus has been somewhat of a tumultuous ride throughout the show's history.  It began on the wrong foot, showing off generic action against bad special effects while characters spoke cheese.  A certain John Hannah carried us through the show until it hit its stride and there became one of the best shows on television for a season and a half until we faced the inevitable: Andy Whitfield was dead and not coming back, as was the character Hannah played.  Suddenly the show relied on a new actor in the role of the show's namesake to take up arms against a villain in Glaber that proved incompetent at the best of times.  They tried, bless their hearts, but the show struggled and lost direction.  Roman soldiers suffered Storm Trooper syndrome, being proven so weak compared to the escaped gladiators that any ten were not worth even a single of the weakest gladiators while Spartacus' character devolved into slow motion screaming and bouts of random speech-giving while intricately-planned battles between equal opponents and character development were put on the backburner.So here we come to Spartacus: War of the Damned, the final season of this epic ride, and almost immediately it became the tale of two shows; the good and the bad.  The good is the villains of the piece.  Crassus is easily Spartacus' most formidable foe yet, and gives a nuanced portrayal that at times can make you love or hate the character in a similar fashion to Hannah's Batiatus.  Much the same with Caesar, whose young arrogance is quickly proven to be well-deserved in a surprising way.  Meanwhile Crassus' son Tiberius provides someone the audience can properly despise.  This is a good set of villains most stories would beg to have as characters who can drive the plot forward and give the heroes of the story something realistically formidable to face off against.  So what's the problem?The problem is the rebellion side of the show.  The former slaves.  The problem begins immediately from the very first scene.  See, it's been months since Vengeance left off.  Spartacus' army has grown to the tens of thousands, if not more, and they trounce around Roman territory defeating big Roman armies.  What's the problem with this, you might ask?  Vengeance, you see, was very favorable toward our protagonists.  All the goals they had set upon joining the rebellion or escaping into freedom were met.  Spartacus got his revenge, Crixus got Naevia back, Gannicus redeemed himself to Oenomaus and everyone else, the couple HUNDRED or so who followed Spartacus, was safely free as they had wanted.  So why are they now an enormous army randomly smashing occasional Roman armies?  What is their new goal, or motivation?  This is never once answered until only a couple episodes are left and then they only name those goals to tell use that they've changed.  Just as bad, the characters are more like caricatures, a bunch of people just going through the motions of what the audience expects while occasionally given a slow motion jumping/screaming sequence.  It's bloody, it's violent, it's sexy, it's boring.  Midway through the season they decide to focus an episode on the Roman camp and it wasn't until midway through that I realized most the rebels had received all of three of the fifty minutes given the episode, and that I did not miss them at all.Such is how it goes for most of the season, as the Romans carry the show while rebels go through the motions and we're left cheering on classic Spartacus and his stubborn invincibility, or classic Gannicus and his drunken partying, or classic Crixus and his passion, without much real development happening.  This begins changing in the final few episodes, where they begin focus on furthering the development of certain individuals, but it is too often abridged (as in the case of Crixus, who is given months of glorious battle as he strikes out on his own...told in the space of under ten minutes) or worse (as in the case of Gannicus and Sibyl) it is completely forced.  All the while we struggle figuring out what these characters actually WANT, what they desire the end result to be.  On the flipside, the Roman camp becomes a mess of tangled plotlines, largely thanks to Crassus' personal slave Kore whose storyline slips into far too many others, pulling them together and going a whole lot of nowhere.  By the end I'd call the episodes some of the worse in the series since the original pilot but for a fantastic finale which tied everything together in almost the best it possibly could given everything which came before.What then to make of Spartacus: War of the Damned?  It is certainly enjoyable.  If you loved the characters before then you'll more than likely keep loving them and want to see them to the bitter end.  It has plenty of enjoyable action and sex scenes to grab your attention.  The Romans are a pure joy to watch and I would not mind at all tuning into a spinoff series focused around Caesar, Crassus and the like.  BUT, the season suffers from a lot of major storytelling issues and is poorly focused upon developing too many new characters and plots and is not the season-long sendoff one might hope it would be.",3,A tale of two shows.,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,5185,"['Spartacus', 'been', 'somewhat', 'tumultuous', 'ride', 'show', 'history', 'began', 'wrong', 'foot', 'showing', 'off', 'generic',

1621922,A1QVEQC37PRHP6,B00B52F278,GWH,"[0, 1]","Spartacus: War of the Damned, well, I think by now everyone know's or realizes that the Starz Spartacus series is ""over the top"" on all levels, but still, it is my guilty pleasure.  In the special features section one of the creators admits to adding too much sex to the series, which is funny because in the HBO series ""ROME"" (which is an amazing and extraordinary and superbly acted series) the historical consultant mentions that he doesn't think there is enough sex in that series. It is true, there is a lot of sex, violence and gore in the series, but what I like about the series is that they do a great job of portraying the ancient Roman social attitudes at the end of the Republic and into the first century the way that it was.  I felt that what they portrayed and how they portrayed the ancient Romans was pretty much the way they were, and right in line with what I've studied.I have a particular taste for great drama, period drama etc., however, SWOD isn't so much about the ""upstairs, downstairs"" dramatics as it is about the sword fighting and the war and conflict.  SWOD at this point now, is outside and takes place largely in fields of battle and so fourth. Therefore I am inclined to say that in SWOD there is not a whole lot of dramatic context, but loads of action, blood and gore. Therefore, for me, the last two episodes in SWOD, episodes 9 and 10 were the best of this installment because of it's dramatic elements.  I have read online or seen interviews online where the actors mentioned that SWOD demanded more acting skills from them because it was a little more dramatic and emotional, that it required them to really put their acting chops to the test.  Those last two episodes are quite sad, and for a number of reasons not the least of which I think everyone kind of knows how it all ends, but also probably because they have to say goodbye to their cast mates, some of whom have been with each other from the start, knew Mr. Whitfield, etc, etc.  However, for me, dramatically, it didn't really live up to it's hype, but it certainly did with the action scenes.  In regards to the actors, Simon Merrells (who portrayed Crassus) was by far the best actor in SWOD.  There is a scene in particular where he's sparring verbally with Caesar and the camera catches and flashes his emotions and looks from different angles, one after the other,  and it is very compelling.  Todd LaSance, the young actor who portrays Caesar, is also very, very good.  Todd LaSance seems to be able to display some range in his acting abilities.  It seems that a lot of people have been critical about Liam McIntyre's interpretation of ""Spartacus"" - I believe largely because they have been, were, loyal to the late Mr. Whitfield.  However, I don't think Mr. McIntyre did a bad job.  Yes, he has similar looks as Mr. Whitfield, they both are (were-in Mr. Whitfields case) good looking men, nice bodies, etc, etc., but in regards to their acting abilities, I personally don't see much difference.  In my opinion, the part of ""Spartacus"" isn't exactly ""Hamlet"" ... he really doesn't have to display a whole lot of range ... and In ""Blood and Sand"" (in my opinion) although he did a great job, I didn't see a lot of rang in the part of Spartacus.  The actress who portrayed Naevia, Ms. Robinson, did a great job there near the end.  In my opinion, her character and Mr. Bennett's character ""Crixus"" had lost their minds a long time ago, and they both were definitely meant for each other because they were both off their rockers.  Again, Ms. Robinson is another actress who replaced an actress before her who performed the role of Naevia.  It seems that Ms. Robinson's look is compared to that of Ms. Brandt (the actress who portrayed Naevia in the previous installments) and it seems that the fans who were loyal to Ms. Brandt would have liked for her to have continued in that role, but Ms. Brandt left for other projects ... and I read that she didn't think the role ""spicy"" enough.  Well, it wasn't til it was ... especially towards the end of the series, and I think Ms. Robinson did a good job at portraying her loss and suffering, plus making me believe that she just basically was nuts all around.Although well done, SWOD is not my favorite installment. ""Blood and Sand"" is my favorite installment, being the most dramatic and having the most ""upstairs/downstairs"" intrigue.  My favorite being the conflict between Ilythia, Licinia and Lucretia.  Those girls were just b***hes. Plain and simple. ""Gods of the Arena"" would be my next favorite, and ""Vengeance"" coming in third.

Both seasons were amazing dramas with excellent action scenes, writing, characterization and acting. If Blood and Sand ended with that one season, it would have been enough for many fans. Sadly, Vengeance turned out to be an utter disaster. You can see my other review for that. I watched the first episode of War of the Damned to see if the season was worth watching. I believe Spartacus, Naevia and company ambushed some Romans in that episode. Ludicrous. Spartacus, Crixus and the others were commanders of the slave armies. They would not personally carry out ambushes like that. This nonsense and the reliance on unnecessary violence to substitute for proper storytelling destroyed the show for me. I had believed the show would accurately depict Spartacus's transition from slave warrior to commander of the slave armies. These men became rich from looting Italy. Yet, they were enemies of the Roman Republic, which eventually was their doom. The show never transitioned these characters. Their mentality remained the same as it was from Blood and Sand. For the lowbrow crowd that is ignorant of history, perhaps this is fine. But for anyone else, it's unacceptable. The show became trash. Is it any surprise that Starz gave up on it?One more thing, whose bright idea was it to make a violent male oriented action TV show combined with overbearing homosexual overtones? I have nothing against homosexuality, but Agron and Nasir's relationship went ridiculously overboard. It's really not surprising why the show got cancelled.The funny thing was, the homosexual relationship in Blood and Sand was much better depicted than in War of the Damned.

1621927,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B00B52F278,Jack E. Levic,"[3, 5]","The Spartacus saga comes to an end with WAR OF THE DAMNED. Although it is called the third season of SPARTACUS, there were four seasons including the prequel.Spartacus and his warriors are now free and moving about the countryside. The bloody battles continue and the former slaves attempt to destroy the Roman Empire. In War of the Damned, the ex-slaves have become as brutal as their former masters. When they overtake a Roman city, no mercy is shown to the Roman citizens. Only the slaves in the city have a chance. The brutality of this season seems to overshadow everything else. The hatred and need for revenge are so strong.SPARTACUS has been a remarkable series. It's visual effects and authentic costumes and sets have been like no other. All the limits on violence and sex have been pushed to the extreme, but now it seems like it is time for Spartacus to end. The bloodletting is no longer so shocking and the sex has been toned down. Most of the actresses still get to do full frontals but the extremes, especially from Season one, have ended.The series seems to be lost as the warriors meander across the Roman empire. The gladiators are gone. Many of the characters from past seasons who added such spice to the show are gone. The show is hanging together by threads. It's just one battle after another followed by one betrayal after another.The show wraps ups the saga the best it can. Some of our heroes survive, others don't. It finally comes to an end and the glory of Rome is left to fate.The end has come and the show's creativity has been exhausted. There would be no need for another season. This set had a few extras that were rather dull and lifeless..more of the wonders of the special effects and the physical hardships of the actors. My big disappointment is the fact that there was no tribute to the original Spartacus Andy Whitfield, who died in 2011. It was his illness that led the producers to do a prequel so Whitfield could be treated and return as Spartacus. Sadly, Whitfield never recovered. Although he is mentioned briefly in the history of the series, he deserved a tribute and more of a mention in the extras on this DVD set.No one can deny that SPARTACUS was a remarkable achievement in TV history. The quality of the actors, costumes, visual effects and sets rival anything seen on the big screen. This was an incredible series that lost its fizz in the final season.

1621931,A2L64BVSRA9O4Z,B00B52F278,Janalyn Robnett,"[0, 1]","This series was amazing! The graphic sex and violence is there, but then you get the feeling they were really trying to convey what life was like in that circle of violence and uprising. The ultimate battle in the final episode, helps you to see how land battles were fought. My favorite story-line, though having no real episode dedicated to them, was the same-gender couple of Agron and Nasir. their moments together were incredibly beautiful and to see Nasir grow from a 'body-slave' for a dominus into a warrior proves that you don't mess with those small in stature. The dialogue was written in almost Shakespearean poetics, so listen carefully. It's one of the many fascinating aspects of this series. &#34;Gratitude&#34; instead of 'thank you', &#34;Apologies&#34; instead of &#34;I'm sorry&#34;. And &#34;absent&#34; instead of 'without'. There were many, many imagery uses and how the writers managed to convey so much of it throughout 4 seasons (I'm including the prequel between 1 & 2 when the main actor of &#34;Blood And Sand&#34; took terminally ill) proves they were dedicated to staying in the zone when it came to the characters and how they communicated. I enjoyed the unveiling of the plot, though not so much the graphic blood and violence. I started getting used to it, but there were times what they did shocked me, so be aware of that going in. I jumped a few times, but if that thing intrigues you, you shouldn't have any trouble. And the fact that Michael Hurst became one of the directors as well as a producer of this show, it was fun to see signs of his directing hand at work. All in all I'm going to miss this series. It was gritty, it held nothing back, and it showed in a positive light two warriors who could love each other amongst other warriors and not be looked at twice, and be completely accepted. In one instance when Agron is injured, he's leaning on Spartacus' shoulder, as he's brought back to the base, but when Nasir approaches, there's a small moment (blink and you'll miss it) where you see Spartacus lay Agron's arm on Nasir's shoulder, as though saying 'I place him in your care, now, Nasir.' Spartacus understood their affection for each other and never said anything about it. It was accepted in those times. A beautiful scene. You never see Spartacus' face during that moment, just his hands gently resting Agron's arm on Nasir's shoulder. But you don't have to see Spartacus to get the meaning there. It's a subtle gesture, but really touched my heart. The respect and understanding, the acceptance of it all. There are quirks, quarrels, disagreements, it's all there amongst the 'brotherhood', but it binds them stronger. It's not just about the politics, or the battles, or the sex, it's about the forging of former slaves into a united front. Highly recommended if you can stomach the graphic violence and nudity. As I said, they hold nothing back on those two counts, but the story lines more than make up the balance.",5,"Bloody, graphic nudity, but beautifully written and acted",1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,2975,"['series', 'was', 'amazing', 'graphic', 'sex', 'violence', 'there', 'then', 'get', 'feeling', 'were', 'really', 'trying', 'convey', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'circle', 'violence', 'uprising', 'ultimate', 'battle', 'final', 'episode', 'see', 'how', 'land', 'battles', 'were', 'fought', 'favorite', 'story-line', 'having', 'real', 'episode', 'dedicated', 'was', 'same-gender', 'couple', 'Agron', 'Nasir', 'moments', 'together', 'were', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'see', 'Nasir', 'grow', ""'body-slave"", ""'"", 'dominus', 'warrior', 'proves', 'do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'small', 'stature', 'dialogue', 'was', 'written', 'almost', 'Shakespearean', 'poetics', 'so', 'listen', 'carefully', 'one', 'many', 'fascinating', 'aspects', 'series', '34', 'Gratitude', '34', 'instead', ""'thank"", '34', 'Apologies', '34', 'instead', '34', ""'m"", 'sorry', '34', '34', 'absent', '34', 'instead', ""'without"", 'were', 'many', 'many', 'imagery', 'uses', 'how', 'writers', 'managed', 'convey', 'so', 'much', '4', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'including', 'prequel', '1', '2', 'when', 'main', 'actor', '34', 'Blood', 'Sand', '34', 'took', 'terminally', 'ill', 'were', 'dedicated', 'staying', 'zone', 'when', 'came', 'characters', 'how', 'communicated', 'enjoyed', 'unveiling', 'plot', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'graphic', 'blood', 'violence', 'started', 'getting', 'used', 'were', 'times', 'what', 'did', 'shocked', 'so', 'be', 'aware', 'going', 'jumped', 'few', 'times', 'thing', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'trouble', 'fact', 'Michael', 'Hurst', 'became', 'one', 'directors', 'as', 'well', 'producer', 'show', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'signs', 'directing', 'hand', 'work', ""'m"", 'going', 'miss', 'series', 'was', 'gritty', 'held', 'nothing', 'back', 'showed', 'positive', 'light', 'two', 'warriors', 'who', 'could', 'love', 'other', 'amongst', 'other', 'warriors', 'not', 'be', 'looked', 'twice', 'be', 'completely', 'accepted', 'one', 'instance', 'when', 'Agron', 'injured', 'leaning', 'Spartacus', 'shoulder', 'brought', 'back', 'base', 'when', 'Nasir', 'small', 'moment', 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'where', 'see', 'Spartacus', 'lay', 'Agron', 'arm', 'Nasir', 'shoulder', 'saying', 'place', 'care', 'now', 'Nasir', 'Spartacus', 'understood', 'affection', 'other', 'never', 'said', 'anything', 'was', 'accepted', 'times', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'never', 'see', 'Spartacus', 'face', 'moment', 'just', 'hands', 'gently', 'resting', 'Agron', 'arm', 'Nasir', 'shoulder', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'Spartacus', 'get', 'meaning', 'there', 'subtle', 'gesture', 'really', 'touched', 'heart', 'respect', 'understanding', 'acceptance', 'are', 'quirks', 'quarrels', 'disagreements', 'there', ""'brotherhood"", 'stronger', 'not', 'just', 'politics', 'battles', 'sex', 'forging', 'former', 'slaves', 'united', 'front', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'can', 'stomach', 'graphic', 'violence', 'nudity', 'said', 'hold', 'nothing', 'back', 'two', 'counts', 'story', 'lines', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'balance']",Spartacus: War of the Damned: Season 3

Bakker,"[0, 1]","See the full review at Metal Arcade .NetSTARZ' Spartacus tells the tale of a Thracian gladiator who led his fellow slaves in an uprising from 73 to 71 BC. After the fall of Roman commander Gaius Claudius Glaber in Spartacus: Vengeance, the rebels have amassed victory after victory and struck fear in the hearts of their former masters. The legend of Spartacus has begun to spread throughout the land, causing thousands of slaves to take up arms for his cause. Roman General Marcus Crassus joins forces with Julius Caesar to take down the Bringer of Rain once and for all - and he proves to be the only man able to match the Thracian in both swordsmanship and intellect. Now Spartacus: War of the Damned has finally arrived on Blu-ray, and its ten fantastic final episodes are rounded out by a host of great features.Spartacus: War of the Damned is an incredible final season, where every episode is stronger than the last, building towards an epic, emotional finale. Liam McIntyre continues in the role of Spartacus from Season 2, and the cast also features Manu Bennett (Crixus), Dustin Clare (Gannicus), Dan Feuerriegel (Agron), Simon Merrells (Crassus), Todd Lasance (Caesar) and Cynthia Addai-Robinson as Naevia.The picture and sound quality are quite good here. The widescreen 1.78:1 1080p image looks sharp and vivid without being oversaturated. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless audio track is phenomenal, with clear dialogue, a bombastic soundtrack and explosive sound effects that fill out the sound field -  it's sure to give your home theater system a workout.As for  the special features, there are six featurettes and Blu-ray exclusive audio commentaries, as well as extended episodes. Spartacus: The Legend Retold is essentially a primer that I'm assuming was aired prior to the season's airing on STARZ. It tells the origins of the Spartacus show, the cast talks about their favorite moments from the series thus far, and also a bit about the transition from the Andy Whitfield era to Liam McIntyre's take on the role. It also goes into the six-episode prequel series Gods Of The Arena, where Dustin Clare's Gannicus took center stage to give Whitfield time off. The Price Of Being A Gladiator is a short chat with some of the cast, as they talk about how physically difficult the Spartacus boot camp is that prepares them for their roles, and how it helps them bond as a group and toughen up for their on-screen battles. They also share some insight into the multitude of injuries that they sustained while filming, from black eyes to broken ribs.A Bloody Farewell sees the cast lamenting the end of the show, and looking back fondly on their great times spent together. The Spoils of War: Revealed goes into the visual effects and how the CGI works to elevate the show visually, beyond what would be normally possible on a stage set. Adorning The Damned sheds light on the intricate costume designs that are created for the show, and shows off some of the incredible details in the outfits that fans may have missed. The Mind Behind Spartacus is a bit of an interview with showrunner and creator  Stephen S. DeNight, talking about his ideas, new characters and storyline concepts for the final season, as well as some of his favorite moments.As with past Spartacus releases, the package is enclosed in a plastic outer sleeve, and when it is removed, the three-disk collection opens up like a book. The inside is adorned with promotional images of the cast, and the front cover features a menacing photo of Liam McIntyre as Spartacus, with raised lettering. The ten episodes included have a total runtime of 562 minutes, and the video is not rated.Very few shows have consistently entertained and engaged me like Spartacus has. The series has consistently, over three seasons and a prequel series, defied expectations and delivered one of the most action-packed, well-acted historical dramas ever to grace the small screen. It's even survived the unfortunate passing of the original lead actor, the late Andy Whitfield. With many great shows having been canceled before their time, I'm glad to see that Spartacus was able to end on its own terms. The Spartacus: War of the Damned Blu-ray is a stellar presentation and package for a mesmerizing, very deserving show, and all fans of the series will definitely want to pick it up.",5,Superb final chapter of an amazing show,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,4341,"['See', 'full', 'review', 'Metal', 'Arcade', '.NetSTARZ', 'Spartacus', 'tale', 'Thracian', 'gladiator', 'who', 'led', 'fellow', 'slaves', 'uprising', '73', '71', 'BC', 'fall', 'Roman', 'commander', 'Gaius', 'Claudius', 'Glaber', 'Spartacus', 'Vengeance', 'rebels', 'have', 'amassed', 'victory', 'victory', 'struck', 'fear', 'hearts', 'former', 'masters', 'legend', 'Spartacus', 'begun', 'spread', 'land', 'causing', 'thousands', 'slaves', 'take', 'up', 'arms', 'cause', 'Roman', 'General', 'Marcus', 'Crassus', 'forces', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'take', 'down', 'Bringer', 'Rain', 'once', 'be', 'only', 'man', 'able', 'match', 'Thracian', 'swordsmanship', 'intellect', 'Now', 'War', 'Damned', 'finally', 'arrived', 'Blu-ray', 'ten', 'fantastic', 'final', 'episodes', 'are', 'rounded', 'out', 'host', 'great', 'features.Spartacus', 'War', 'Damned', 'incredible', 'final', 'season', 'where', 'episode', 'stronger', 'last', 'building', 'towards', 'epic', 'emotional', 'finale', 'Liam', 'McIntyre', 'role', 'Spartacus', 'Season', '2', 'cast', 'also', 'Manu', 'Bennett', 'Crixus', 'Dustin', 'Clare', 'Gannicus', 'Dan', 'Feuerriegel', 'Agron', 'Simon', 'Merrells', 'Crassus', 'Todd', 'Lasance', 'Caesar', 'Cynthia', 'Addai-Robinson', 'Naevia.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'widescreen', '1.78:1', '1080p', 'image', 'sharp', 'vivid', 'being', 'oversaturated', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '5.1', 'lossless', 'audio', 'track', 'phenomenal', 'clear', 'dialogue', 'bombastic', 'soundtrack', 'explosive', 'sound', 'effects', 'fill', 'out', 'sound', 'field', 'sure', 'give', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'workout.As', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'six', 'featurettes', 'Blu-ray', 'exclusive', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'as', 'well', 'extended', 'episodes', 'Spartacus', 'Legend', 'Retold', 'essentially', 'primer', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'was', 'aired', 'prior', 'season', 'airing', 'STARZ', 'origins', 'Spartacus', 'show', 'cast', 'talks', 'favorite', 'moments', 'series', 'thus', 'far', 'also', 'bit', 'transition', 'Andy', 'Whitfield', 'era', 'Liam', 'McIntyre', 'take', 'role', 'also', 'six-episode', 'prequel', 'series', 'Gods', 'Arena', 'where', 'Dustin', 'Clare', 'Gannicus', 'took', 'center', 'stage', 'give', 'Whitfield', 'time', 'off', 'Price', 'Being', 'A', 'Gladiator', 'short', 'chat', 'cast', 'talk', 'how', 'physically', 'difficult', 'Spartacus', 'boot', 'camp', 'roles', 'how', 'bond', 'group', 'up', 'on-screen', 'battles', 'also', 'share', 'insight', 'multitude', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'filming', 'black', 'eyes', 'broken', 'ribs.A', 'Bloody', 'Farewell', 'cast', 'lamenting', 'end', 'show', 'looking', 'back', 'fondly', 'great', 'times', 'spent', 'together', 'Spoils', 'War', 'Revealed', 'visual', 'effects', 'how', 'CGI', 'elevate', 'show', 'visually', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'normally', 'possible', 'stage', 'set', 'Adorning', 'Damned', 'sheds', 'light', 'intricate', 'costume', 'designs', 'are', 'created', 'show', 'off', 'incredible', 'details', 'outfits', 'fans', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'Mind', 'Behind', 'Spartacus', 'bit', 'interview', 'showrunner', 'creator', 'Stephen', 'S.', 'DeNight', 'talking', 'ideas', 'new', 'characters', 'storyline', 'concepts', 'final', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'favorite', 'moments.As', 'past', 'Spartacus', 'releases', 'package', 'enclosed', 'plastic', 'outer', 'sleeve', 'when', 'removed', 'three-disk', 'collection', 'up', 'book', 'inside', 'adorned', 'promotional', 'images', 'cast', 'front', 'cover', 'menacing', 'photo', 'Liam', 'McIntyre', 'Spartacus', 'raised', 'lettering', 'ten', 'episodes', 'included', 'have', 'total', 'runtime', '562', 'minutes', 'video', 'not', 'rated.Very', 'few', 'shows', 'have', 'consistently', 'entertained', 'engaged', 'Spartacus', 'series', 'consistently', 'three', 'seasons', 'prequel', 'series', 'defied', 'expectations', 'delivered', 'one', 'most', 'action-packed', 'well-acted', 'historical', 'dramas', 'ever', 'grace', 'small', 'screen', 'even', 'survived', 'unfortunate', 'passing', 'original', 'lead', 'actor', 'late', 'Andy', 'Whitfield', 'many', 'great', 'shows', 'having', 'been', 'canceled', 'time', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'Spartacus', 'was', 'able', 'end', 'own', 'terms', 'Spartacus', 'War', 'Damned', 'Blu-ray', 'stellar', 'presentation', 'package', 'mesmerizing', 'very', 'deserving', 'show', 'fans', 'series', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'pick', 'up']",Spartacus: War of the Damned: Season 3

I have watched the entire series at least a dozen times on on-demand, and still can't wait to own the whole set! While much has been said about the slaves and the their Roman foes, I would say that the conflict between Ilthiya and Lucretia is one the most compelling aspect of the first two seasons. These two women are truly evil & deadly without ever touching a weapon. Watching these two plot and scheme against each other, and everyone else, was half the show. I loved ""War of the Damned"", but their presence was definitely missed. How neither Viva or Lucy were nominated for emmys is outrageous. And no one, absolutely no one, can curse and rage in Roman like John Hannah. Who needs Shakespeare when you have Batiatus! The prequel was genius to bring Batiatus & Lucretia back.And take it easy on Liam, the man got his dream job in the worst way. He had to replace the unreplacable Andy Whitfield, and no matter what he did people were going to have a problem with it.

I think the only drop-off was knowing that it was the final season so while watching, I kept thinking ""all these characters are going to die.""  Despite that notion, it was still full of surprises and much of the premise is fairly accurate to history (at least what we know of Spartacus.)""Spartacus:  War of the Damned"" picks up where season two left off.  It has been about one year since the beginning of the slave rebellion initiated by the gladiators and slaves who overthrew the House of Batiatus.  As the rebellion swells, Spartacus, Crixus, Agron, and Gannicus agree they must find a larger base for their band of slaves.  In Rome, the senate desperately names Marcus Crassus leader of the Army against Spartacus.  Crassus enlists Gaius Julius Caesar into his army, along with Crassus' repulsive son, Tiberius.After Spartacus and his men take their city, they seek assistance from a gang of local pirates.  While meeting these pirates outside city walls, Tiberius leads an attack against the rebels but fails to hold his ranks.  Once rejoined with his father's army, Crassus commands a display of decimation for Tiberius and his men.  The slyness of Marcus Crassus begins to be revealed as he slips Caesar into the slave city as a spy pretended to be one of the rebels.  Caesar causes upset among the slaves, driving Crixus and Spartacus to quarrels over their purposes.Once the city falls at Crassus' hand, the rebel army becomes trapped in a snowy ridge; they begin to freeze and starve.  The rift between Spartacus and Crixus grows.  Spartacus devises a plan to lead his army over the snowy ridge.  Once escaped, the rebel army splits between Spartacus and Crixus.As far as overviewing the season, I have elected to stop here because the final 2-3 episodes wrap up the entire series--well worth the watch.  What I found most interesting about season 3 is the ability of the writers to truly expose the depth of the characters; those you may have previously thought you hated now become those you love, and vice versa.  This is a show that stays in the mind long after it's over because it is hard to definitively point to ""what is right"" and ""what is wrong.""

1621951,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00B52F278,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 5]","Note: The abundance of 1 Star reviews for the on-demand option were for a technical problem (a missing episode) that has since been corrected and not for the quality of the show itself.Don't be put off by the declaration that ""Spartacus: War of the Damned"" is the third season of the vivid Starz series.  This should be labeled as the fourth season, instead, and any attempt to call it something else is unnecessarily confusing to new viewers.  When original actor Andy Whitfield became ill after the first season, a short prequel was requisitioned with many of the same characters.  Although not technically a part of the Spartacus storyline, it is an almost essential inclusion to this saga of blood, guts, sex and swordplay.  Whitfield was eventually unable to return to the role and it was recast with Liam McIntyre for Vengeance and War of the Damned.  After bowing out, Whitfield did succumb to cancer at the age of 39 and his absence is noteworthy as the series comes to its conclusion.If you are just discovering the series, here's the order in which the titles were released:1) Spartacus: Blood and Sand (the official Season One)2) Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (the aforementioned prequel)3) Spartacus: Vengeance (the official Season Two)4) Spartacus: War of the Damned (the official Season Three)No one can ever accuse ""Spartacus"" of being subtle or playing it safe.  Rarely has a television series so reveled in over-the-top violence and bloodshed.  Employing graphic CGI effects, every episode was filled with gleeful unpleasantness, buckets of blood, copious amounts of nudity, illicit sexual pairings, and enough double dealings and political machinations to fuel several comparable shows.  With regular seasons running only 10-13 episodes each, the show was exceedingly fast paced and in hyper drive at all time.  This was a bonanza for action fans, but could sometimes let character development languish.  Truth be told, while I was completely satisfied with Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena, I felt like Vengeance was a bit more problematic.  Introducing a slew of new characters, the show's plotlines were in transition as was its cast (this was McIntyre's first year).  I felt many of the female characters became too forced and the romantic couplings didn't ignite my passions.""War of the Damned"" picks up after Spartacus has finally avenged the death of his wife.  What has been a personal mission until this point now becomes something else entirely.  The rebels continue to score victories against the Roman Empire and Spartacus and his generals see an opportunity to really change the world in which they live.  At his side, Spartacus continues to be supported by former rival Crixus (an invaluable Manu Bennett), Gannicus (Dustin Clare) and Agron (Daniel Feuerriegel).  The show is tasked with providing a new primary villain after the events of last year, and several likely candidates pop up in early episodes.  Eventually, though, it is a wily politician Marcus Crassus (Simon Merrells) that fills this void and even enlists a young Julius Caesar (Todd Lasance).  As the rebels get closer to their goal, they become increasingly brutal.  Part of the pleasure of ""Spartacus"" is that its heroes are not always easy to root for.My reservations about War of the Damned (which is so much more involving than Vengeance) still, however, stem from the female characters.  I still didn't believe central relationships or thought they weren't integrated into the central plot.  Also, it's easy to imagine the former gladiators stepping up as warriors.  Did they have to make everyone a fierce opponent for bloodthirsty swordplay?  Without giving anything away, I will say that a solid season ends with an incredible finale.  As satisfying, breathtaking, and memorable as you could hope for, this epic series goes out with a bang!  It is both emotional and exciting and is expertly choreographed.  If you haven't seen the series, please start from the beginning.  It's fun, decadent, and outrageously over-the-top but it makes no apologies for being exactly what it is.  And that is glorious entertainment.

Chocked full of battles, blood, and brutality, this is one show that I am very sad to see end.This series is truly impressive on many levels.  It is visually amazing, the bloodshed and gore are superb, the drama is intense, and the acting is top notch.  But the storyline never gets stale, either.  It moves at rapid pace, but not so fast as to lose the audience.  The result is an amazing show that is as engrossing as it is vicious.As with its predecessors, SPARTACUS: WAR OF THE DAMNED is shot well and looks stunning onscreen.  The historical backdrops are vivid and set the stage for a realistic journey back in time.  This allows for full immersion into Spartacus' world, and thus grants a rich entertainment experience.Liam McIntyre once again does a perfect job with the role of Spartacus, and he is surrounded by a stellar cast.  I am happy to see McIntyre finish out the role that Andy Whitfield started; McIntyre does the deceased actor a great honor by flourishing in the Spartacus mantle.

My hats off to STARZ and the creative team behind the Spartacus series who really elevated the material to must see entertainment.  Both Andy Whitfield and Liam McIntire truly excelled at portraying Spartacus-each in his own unique way.  Andy will always be the original and was sorely missed when he passed away, but Liam having had some giant shoes to fill-stepped in and ultimately hit his own stride.  I will miss this show and all the great and supremely memorable characters it introduced.

The mostly true story (I don't believe Julius Gaius Caesar ever got within a hundred yards of Spartacus -- maybe he saw him in the arena) is compelling because anyone fighting against oppression is compelling.  The dialog which seems to be based on a literal translation of Latin is unusual and helps transport us back in time.  The sexuality is astoundingly raw but there are clearly depictions of sexual love although I can't really tell the difference from the way the scenes are shot.I hate to love this series because of the sheer brutality of it and the subconscious message: hey its okay to be rapacious in every way and let me show you dozens of people who were for good and not so good reasons.The CGI is excellent or maybe I am just getting used to accepting what is obviously a simulation.",5,"Brutal and sexual the most explicit tv show ever, but compelling for the historical quality",1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,1139,"['strange', 'confluence', 'brutality', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'brutality', 'time', 'American', 'consciousness', 'recognize', 'are', 'precisely', 'same', 'sort', 'evil', 'empire', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'bloody', 'sexuality', 'exploitative', 'cruel', 'nature', 'series', 'compelling', 'lot', 'viewers', 'mostly', 'true', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Julius', 'Gaius', 'Caesar', 'ever', 'got', 'hundred', 'yards', 'Spartacus', 'maybe', 'saw', 'arena', 'compelling', 'anyone', 'fighting', 'oppression', 'compelling', 'dialog', 'be', 'based', 'literal', 'translation', 'Latin', 'unusual', 'transport', 'back', 'time', 'sexuality', 'astoundingly', 'raw', 'are', 'clearly', 'depictions', 'sexual', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'difference', 'way', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot.I', 'hate', 'love', 'series', 'sheer', 'brutality', 'subconscious', 'message', 'hey', 'okay', 'be', 'rapacious', 'way', 'let', 'show', 'dozens', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'good', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'reasons.The', 'CGI', 'excellent', 'maybe', 'am', 'just', 'getting', 'used', 'accepting', 'what', 'obviously', 'simulation']",Spartacus: War of the Damned: Season 3

Spartacus: War of the Damned picks up maybe a year after the stunning finale of Spartacus: Vengeance. Having taken his revenge against the Roman patricians that enslaved him and killed his wife and friends, Spartacus leads what is now an army of liberated slaves in all-out war against the Republic.  He struggles with both the cunning Imperator leading the Romans against him and the growing tensions within his own army, mowing down legions and cities while gathering strength for what may become an epic battle for Rome itself.With this conclusion of the Spartacus series, Stephen DeKnight and company have achieved something quite rare in television, or anywhere else for that matter: an epic story simultaneously offering compelling plot, characters, action and drama, while staying remarkably close to (what we know of) the story of the real-life Spartacus.  It's a brutal story, and the show pulls absolutely no punches in the telling, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - this is some of the finest television I've seen since M*A*S*H.  Here's why:- With each season the scope of the story has grown, and the story line has become more suble and complex.  War of the Damned is no exception.  Spartacus and his army have Rome in a near-panic. The Senate enlists ultra-wealthy consul Marcus Crassus to hire an army and put down the rebellion.  From the first episode we see that Spartacus is facing an equally intelligent, deadly and determined opponent in Crassus; this is as much a war of wills and cunning as it is of swords.  Both commanders also have to deal with dissent and intrigue within their own ranks: Spartacus with Crixus's ongoing lust for strategy-free head-to-head combat, and Crassus with the struggle of wills between himself, his coming-of-age son Tiberius, and a young, mad-genius praetor named Gaius Julius Caesar. (Yeah - THAT Julius Caesar.)- Once again the cast has outdone themselves.  In reviews of the previous three seasons I've noted one or two exceptional performances, a task which has grown steadily more difficult as the overall quality of the acting has continued to improve.  This time around it's *really* hard to pick a standout; everyone involved with this show clearly gave their all and then some to wrap things up in style.  I'll name two, but bear in mind that there are about a dozen ties for a very close third place:---- Liam McIntyre.  It took him a few episodes in S:V to get comfortable with the daunting job of filling Andy Whitfield's sandals but fill them he did, and in WotD he has the role of the ruthless, idealistic warrior-king solidly nailed.---- Dustin Clare.  This season he backed off on the gonzo just a notch and it *works*, making Gannicus the perfect rogue super-warrior with just a hint of weariness showing through.  If he survives the series finale (airing in about 15 minutes as I write this) this is the guy I'd want to see in his own spinoff series.- Once again they've raised the bar with some of the best FX and cinematography on television.  The directors had a little fun with their state-of-the-art camera platforms this time, giving us some slick POV and following shots as the actors whirl and tumble in battle, and even more ambitious and exciting movie-quality CGI.  I'm looking forward to seeing the behind-the-scenes specials when the DVDs come out.  And, once again, they've used all these nifty tools to give us some jaw-droppingly powerful and beautiful moments; see below for one of the better examples.- In my review of Spartacus: Vengeance, I made a few critical points in that the two post-Blood and Sand series tended to start slowly and, more importantly, that the story was in danger of becoming lost in the increasingly gratuitous and over-the-top sex and gore. I'm not so conceited as to think DeKnight and Co. read that review and instantly saw the error of their ways, but they've certainly listened to someone of like sentiment. This time around the story went into high gear literally from the first minute of the first episode and rarely let up afterward. The sex is still as explicit and the swordplay still as gory as ever, but they aren't shoving our faces in the latter as was becoming endemic in S:V; indeed, as in Blood and Sand, they're once again using it at times to genuine artistic effect.Best example: In episode eight, ""Separate Paths,"" a major character is captured and beheaded by the Romans (not exactly a spoiler in *this* series) as his lover is forced to watch.  A split-second before his end, the scene cuts to an extreme close-up of the woman, and we see the coup de grace reflected in her teared-up eye.  Beautiful (as far as that word can apply to a beheading,) and ten times the impact of just letting us watch the victim spew a gallon of blood and collapse.The end of the series is about 45 minutes away as I write this, and what I said in my review of S:B&S; stands now more than ever: If you have any interest at all in historical fiction and you can handle the TV-MA material, this series is an unqualified must-see.  Five stars with blood-spattered laurel wreaths.(9/4)  Discs in hand at last!  So far I've watched episode 1 and the special features.  As with S:V, the quality in 1080p, even for the featurettes, is amazing; razor-sharp video that shows off the attention to detail that was put into the sets, costumes and such - it's more like a ten-hour movie than a TV series.  (As with the other season sets, that sharp detail also shows off some added, and at times quite gory, footage cut from the broadcast version.)  The special features were imho a bit heavy on training (the ""Spartacus Workout"" - oy) and a bit light on production stuff, but you still get a lot of good supplemental material: interviews with past and present cast members including a too-brief chat with Andy Whitfield, some good candid behind-the-scenes material both on- and off-set, and a very good, extended interview with Stephen DeKnight on how the series came to be, and the challenges they faced when moving beyond the fixed sets of the first two seasons to the slopes of Vesuvius and the hills of Rome.  You get a really good feel of the close camaraderie of the cast and crew both on- and off-camera, imho one of the major factors in making this show a success.  All in all, well worth watching.",5,"The final season, and possibly the best",1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,6515,"['Updated', '4/12/13', '9/4/13', 'Spartacus', 'saga', 'Starz', 'given', 'most',

It's a paradigm-changer. Above all it seems REAL. Every scene, costume, background and kind of behavior is made real by thorough uncompromising historical research.Social, sexual, spiritual, government/politics, behavior, manners and mores are represented as were in 70 B.C. Details all attended. SPARTACUS' three seasons are all painstakingly written, art-directed, artistically shot. Superbly, dramatically envisioned, acted, recreated in ways that cry out THIS IS REAL. Sometimes uncomfortably real. (Something rare: No mood-reflecting background music, just the music, mostly horns, playing in that era to match action. Which works very well)For those who can stomach gore and perversity (sex, torture, murder) there are excesses; camera tricks emphasize blood-lust. Slo-mo shots in all episodes may be too much. CGI of blood spurting, heads rolling, limbs flying, intestines flailing. For shocking, violent sex orgies (surprisingly uncensored) or hideous torture scenes - all probably for the sake of reality of Roman life in the 70's (B.C.). Vivid background depictions of crude, cruel everyday life on streets or in luxurious palatial homes and official areas of privileged patricians add layers of information and action.There are no subtitles, just chapter titles. Far better, ingenious writing echos rhythms of spoken Latin. (60 years ago - why, I can't remember - I took Latin, vocabulary's 90% lost to me). Though I'm no linguist, the Latin cadence is conveyed in the English sound track and rhetoric seem as real as all else in this milestone production.Beyond often shockingly lurid moments, SPARTACUS offers sharp moral lessons. Like, slavery, suppression/population exploitation, excessive anything (ego, arrogance included) doesn't work for long. In fact, such have an inevitable and awful backlash on both perps and victims.You'll see the beauty of love, loyalty, ethics and allegiance too.BTW, I'm no shill for upgrading video and audio electronics; but this truly magnificent mini-series seems a good reason to upgrade to a Blu-Ray player - which you probably know remarkably upgrades video and audio for most any DVD format.SPARTACUS is the most uncompromising film/series recommendation I've ever made. BUT - Caveat Emptor. . .This Spartacus is not for family viewing or for those with puritanical leanings or prone to psychotic violence - like, how close dare we come to porn and excessive, vivid, glorified violence in mass media? Still, SPARTACUS is a great closest-to historically-accurate presentation of seminal changes in Roman social, cultural, personal beliefs and values - while still offering incredible, engrossing, exciting entertainment. It is A Work of ArtA LastNote from the NYTimes 1000-best movies ever:""In today's excerpt - ancient Rome was built on slavery, and slaves constituted as much as forty percent of the population. This slavery could be unspeakably gruesome, whether it was the tens of thousands of slaves that died in the Roman mines in Spain, or those that were condemned to die as gladiators, and so Rome was left to ruthlessly crush innumerable slave rebellions:Spartacus, who was born north of Greece, in Thrace, received training in the Roman army as a barbarian 'auxiliary' (ally) before becoming a slave in 73 BCE. It's not clear why he was enslaved after serving Rome. However, his combat skills made him a natural candidate for the gladiator school at Capua, about one hundred miles from Rome.Here Spartacus and his fellow slaves learned how to entertain a Roman audience with dramatic hand-to-hand combat. Knowing they were going to their certain deaths, however, about eighty gladiators followed Spartacus into rebellion - using kitchen utensils as weapons. Before long they armed themselves with real weapons, slaughtering Roman soldiers who tried to stop them. Then they escaped to the countryside, where Spartacus incited a general slave uprising, attracting thousands of field workers to his cause. He led the rebel slaves to a mountaintop, where they built a fortified encampment.At first the Roman Senate viewed the uprising as a minor threat, but they soon learned better, and dispatched two commanders (praetors) to besiege the mountain and starve the slave army into submission. Spartacus launched a daring counterattack, ordering his soldiers to use vines to rappel down the side of the mountain.Of course the Roman Senate couldn't allow the slave rebellion to succeed, as the Roman economy was increasingly based on slavery. So they dispatched a new commander, Crassus, with twelve legions - a huge force - only to have the advance force of two legions annihilated by the slave army.(SPOILER AHEAD!)Spartacus now led the rebels south, to Sicily, where he planned torendezvous with pirates he'd hired to take them to safety. But the pirates never showed, and the slaves found themselves trapped on a narrow peninsula. ... Desperate, Spartacus decided he had no choice but to fight the Romans head on. Here the Romans finally defeated the rebel army, showing no mercy as they butchered sixty thousand runaway slaves, including women and children.

Its high end production at its best. The acting, period wardrobe, theatrics, sets and all special effects are spot on and to industry (A-list) levels of quality and standards. However, be (warned), those of you who have families and kids under the age of 16. This movie hides NOTHING!  So be forewarned. It has bouts of porn woven throughout the series. Example: full on male and female nudity, including gay sex acts, lesbian sex acts, orgies and lewdness acts. This movie is also extremely bloody and gory to the 10th power. So if you have kids, be wise and purchase with caution. I'm just being honest. Otherwise, this movie has everything a man could ever want, no disrespect to the ladies out there.

1622003,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B00B52F278,Sky,"[59, 64]","First, for those that may not have ever seen Spartacus on Starz and are looking to get into the series via DVD or Instant Video based on its popularity, Spartacus: War of the Damned is season 3 of the show but technically the fourth season. After the excellent 2010 5-star season premier under the title Spartacus: Blood and Sand, Andy Whitfield who played the lead role of Spartacus tragically died of cancer. Whitfield embodied Spartacus; he was a believable, imposing, rough, tough character that made viewers feel like they were watching the real guy from circa 70 BC. His untimely illness left the studio scrambling to decide how to or if the series would continue. Ultimately the studio decided to produce a prequel that ideally would give Whitfield time to recover after treatment, but sadly Whitfield relapsed and passed shortly after production of the prequel.The prequel was called Gods of the Arena and it was excellent. But there was something missing from Gods that made Blood & Sand the 5-Star series that it was: Andy Whitfield and his Spartacus character. Then in Vengeance we got Spartacus back, but was Whitfield really replaceable? Starz took a chance and went for the Whitfield look-alike with Liam McIntyre versus finding another imposing force that could also act. Yes, McIntyre does look quite a bit like Whitfield, but there was something just a little less imposing, less rough and less tough about the guy; in Vengeance, McIntyre was a kinder, warmer Spartacus that smiled too much. But in War of the Damned something changed...dramatically...McIntyre stopped smiling and started kicking and carving you-know-what. And ultimately, War of the Damned rivaled the first season...which is saying a lot!Indeed...War of the Damned is one of the best series finales that I have ever sat through. McIntyre really captured the essence of what Whitfield started in season one: Spartacus as a down but not beaten man thrown into slavery determined to be free and stop at nothing to do so. The supporting cast deserves high honors as well; returning characters put their hearts' and souls' into every episode--especially Manu Bennett as Crixus. And new cast members had some tough shoes to fill after some amazing performances by the likes of John Hannah, Lucy Lawless and several others in seasons past. But the new characters filled their parts with passion and believability...especially those in the parts of Crassus, his son Tiberius, and Julius Gaius Caesar.As for the show itself, similar to its series predecessors, Spartacus War of the Damned leaves nothing for the imagination during its time period: love, battle, adultery, orgy, torture, rape, murder...it's all there in all its glory...and I mean ALL its glory. The events of Spartacus War of the Damned take place after Spartacus' gang of gladiators escape slavery and form a large rebellion to strike down Roman slavery, and if you know the true story of Spartacus then you know that this series finally will leave fans as disappointed in Spartacus' end as they are satisfied with the absolute best series to have ever aired on the Starz network.Keep the credits rolling after the final episode to see the tribute to Andy Whitfield in the Arena shouting: ""I am SPARTACUS!""Blood and Sand: 5 starsGods of the Arena: 4 starsVengeance: 3 starsWar of the Damned: 5 stars",5,I Am SPARTACUS!,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,3344,"['First', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Spartacus', 'Starz', 'are', 'looking', 'get', 'series', 'DVD', 'Instant', 'Video', 'based', 'popularity', 'Spartacus', 'War', 'Damned', 'season', '3', 'show', 'technically', 'fourth', 'season', 'excellent', '2010', '5-star', 'season', 'premier', 'title', 'Spartacus', 'Blood', 'Sand', 'Andy', 'Whitfield', 'who', 'played', 'lead', 'role', 'Spartacus', 'tragically', 'died', 'cancer', 'Whitfield', 'embodied', 'Spartacus', 'was', 'believable', 'imposing', 'rough', 'tough', 'character', 'made', 'viewers', 'feel', 'were', 'watching', 'real', 'guy', 'circa', '70', 'BC', 'untimely', 'illness', 'left', 'studio', 'scrambling', 'decide', 'how', 'series', 'would', 'continue', 'Ultimately', 'studio', 'decided', 'produce', 'prequel', 'ideally', 'would', 'give', 'Whitfield', 'time', 'recover', 'treatment', 'sadly', 'Whitfield', 'relapsed', 'passed', 'shortly', 'production', 'prequel.The', 'prequel', 'was', 'called', 'Gods', 'Arena', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'something', 'missing', 'Gods', 'made', 'Blood', 'Sand', '5-Star', 'series', 'was', 'Andy', 'Whitfield', 'Spartacus', 'character', 'Then', 'Vengeance', 'got', 'Spartacus', 'back', 'was', 'Whitfield', 'really', 'replaceable', 'Starz', 'took', 'chance', 'went', 'Whitfield', 'look-alike', 'Liam', 'McIntyre', 'versus', 'finding', 'imposing', 'force', 'could', 'also', 'act', 'Yes', 'McIntyre', 'look', 'quite', 'bit', 'Whitfield', 'was', 'something', 'just', 'little', 'less', 'imposing', 'rough', 'less', 'tough', 'guy', 'Vengeance', 'McIntyre', 'was', 'kinder', 'warmer', 'Spartacus', 'smiled', 'too', 'much', 'War', 'Damned', 'something', 'changed', 'dramatically', 'McIntyre', 'stopped', 'smiling', 'started', 'kicking', 'carving', 'you-know-what', 'ultimately', 'War', 'Damned', 'rivaled', 'first', 'season', 'saying', 'lot', 'Indeed', 'War', 'Damned', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'sat', 'McIntyre', 'really', 'captured', 'essence', 'what', 'Whitfield', 'started', 'season', 'one', 'Spartacus', 'down', 'not', 'beaten', 'man', 'thrown', 'slavery', 'determined', 'be', 'free', 'stop', 'nothing', 'do', 'so', 'supporting', 'cast', 'deserves', 'high', 'honors', 'well', 'returning', 'characters', 'put', 'hearts', 'souls', 'episode', 'especially', 'Manu', 'Bennett', 'Crixus', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'had', 'tough', 'shoes', 'fill', 'amazing', 'performances', 'likes', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'several', 'others', 'seasons', 'past', 'new', 'characters', 'filled', 'parts', 'passion', 'believability', 'especially', 'parts', 'Crassus', 'son', 'Tiberius', 'Julius', 'Gaius', 'Caesar.As', 'show', 'similar', 'series', 'predecessors', 'Spartacus', 'War', 'Damned', 'nothing', 'imagination', 'time', 'period', 'love', 'battle', 'adultery', 'orgy', 'torture', 'rape', 'murder', 'there', 'glory', 'mean', 'glory', 'events', 'Spartacus', 'War', 'Damned', 'take', 'place', 'Spartacus', 'gang', 'gladiators', 'escape', 'slavery', 'form', 'large', 'rebellion', 'strike', 'down', 'Roman', 'slavery', 'know', 'true', 'story', 'Spartacus', 'then', 'know', 'series', 'finally', 'will', 'leave', 'fans', 'disappointed', 'Spartacus', 'end', 'are', 'satisfied', 'absolute', 'best', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'aired', 'Starz', 'network.Keep', 'credits', 'rolling', 'final', 'episode', 'see', 'tribute', 'Andy', 'Whitfield', 'Arena', 'shouting', 'am', 'SPARTACUS', 'Blood', 'Sand', '5', 'starsGods', 'Arena', '4', 'starsVengeance', '3', 'starsWar', 'Damned', '5', 'stars']",Spartacus: War of the Damned: Season 3
