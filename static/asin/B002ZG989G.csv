1306774,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG989G,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I wasn't all that excited about this film.  It just seemed to me to be one of those generic rom/coms that live in that little world where polar opposites attract in ginormous ways; you know, the films that repeat the same running jokes from start to finish.  And then, you have that uncomfortable `let's try and make this dramatic' moment where something terrible happens and then they try and fit in the `funny'.  Throw on top of that the fact that neither Josh Duhamel nor Katherine Heigl have truly caught my attention in the past; both of them failing to bring the charisma they are expected to have to a film.In other words; I expected a disaster here.Instead, I got a rather surprising film that actually understood the balancing act between funny, charming and honest.  Sure, Josh and Katherine don't really bring anything dynamic to the table, and Josh in particular can ring rather dullish, but together they found a certain spark that, with the aid of some deftly layered direction, was able to latch on to the audience quite nicely.The film tells the `unlikely' story of two individuals who share the same friends but openly loathe one another.  Holly is a prude and a serious, independent business woman and Messer is a suave playboy who prides himself in sports and `tail'.  The opening sequences of the film show the two set up on a blind date by their mutual `couple' friends only to never make it to the restaurant thanks to their polar opposite personalities.  Then we see snippets of their life as they `share' their friends and become central forces in the upbringing of their daughter, Sophie.  Then tragedy strikes in the form of a car accident that claims the couple's lives.  Thankfully, Sophie was not in the car, but now Holly and Messer are faced with a dilemma.  Sophie's parents have named BOTH of them her guardians in the unlikely event that they both die.How can two people who hate one another raise a baby together?So, the story is certainly the furthest thing from believable, but it all works somehow.  In fact, it really works.  Sure, some of the jokes can be grating (the endless barrage of `Josh Duhamel is hot' jokes become tiresome mainly because he's not THAT attractive and he lacks any real charm) and some of the clich&eacute;s are unnecessary (the neighborhood `help' seems too formulaic to be read as honest) but the parts that really matter, like the relationship shifts between Holly and Messer, actually work.  You believe their relationship in all of its stages, and even though you could probably guess the ending, the way that the film is constructed makes you doubt it till the very end, which is a refreshing `sleight of hand'.  Honestly, real kudos needs to be given to the film's director, Greg Berlanti, for he really understood how to take something comedic, add in tonal shifts that read genuine (the tears will come) but never forsaking his real goal here, which is to charm your hearts.I guess you really can't judge a book by it's cover.",4,This was unexpected...,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2999,"['was', ""n't"", 'that', 'excited', 'film', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'one', 'generic', 'rom/coms', 'live', 'little', 'world', 'where', 'polar', 'opposites', 'attract', 'ginormous', 'ways', 'know', 'films', 'repeat', 'same', 'running', 'jokes', 'start', 'finish', 'then', 'have', 'uncomfortable', 'let', 'try', 'make', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'where', 'something', 'terrible', 'happens', 'then', 'try', 'fit', 'funny', 'Throw', 'top', 'fact', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'have', 'truly', 'caught', 'attention', 'past', 'failing', 'bring', 'charisma', 'are', 'expected', 'have', 'film.In', 'other', 'words', 'expected', 'disaster', 'here.Instead', 'got', 'rather', 'surprising', 'film', 'actually', 'understood', 'balancing', 'act', 'funny', 'charming', 'honest', 'Sure', 'Josh', 'Katherine', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'bring', 'anything', 'dynamic', 'table', 'Josh', 'particular', 'can', 'ring', 'rather', 'dullish', 'together', 'found', 'certain', 'spark', 'aid', 'deftly', 'layered', 'direction', 'was', 'able', 'latch', 'audience', 'quite', 'nicely.The', 'film', 'unlikely', 'story', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'share', 'same', 'friends', 'openly', 'one', 'Holly', 'prude', 'serious', 'independent', 'business', 'woman', 'Messer', 'suave', 'playboy', 'who', 'sports', 'tail', 'opening', 'sequences', 'film', 'show', 'two', 'set', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'mutual', 'couple', 'friends', 'only', 'never', 'make', 'restaurant', 'thanks', 'polar', 'opposite', 'personalities', 'Then', 'see', 'snippets', 'life', 'share', 'friends', 'become', 'central', 'forces', 'upbringing', 'daughter', 'Sophie', 'Then', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'form', 'car', 'accident', 'couple', 'lives', 'Thankfully', 'Sophie', 'was', 'not', 'car', 'now', 'Holly', 'Messer', 'are', 'faced', 'dilemma', 'Sophie', 'parents', 'have', 'named', 'BOTH', 'guardians', 'unlikely', 'event', 'die.How', 'can', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'one', 'raise', 'baby', 'together', 'So', 'story', 'certainly', 'furthest', 'thing', 'believable', 'somehow', 'fact', 'really', 'Sure', 'jokes', 'can', 'be', 'grating', 'endless', 'barrage', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'hot', 'jokes', 'become', 'tiresome', 'mainly', 'not', 'THAT', 'attractive', 'real', 'charm', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'neighborhood', 'help', 'too', 'formulaic', 'be', 'read', 'honest', 'parts', 'really', 'matter', 'relationship', 'shifts', 'Holly', 'Messer', 'actually', 'work', 'believe', 'relationship', 'stages', 'even', 'could', 'probably', 'guess', 'ending', 'way', 'film', 'constructed', 'doubt', 'till', 'very', 'end', 'refreshing', 'sleight', 'hand', 'Honestly', 'real', 'kudos', 'needs', 'be', 'given', 'film', 'director', 'Greg', 'Berlanti', 'really', 'understood', 'how', 'take', 'something', 'comedic', 'add', 'tonal', 'shifts', 'read', 'genuine', 'tears', 'will', 'come', 'never', 'forsaking', 'real', 'goal', 'here', 'charm', 'hearts.I', 'guess', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover']",N/A

It is 114 minutes and is rated PG-13. That rating is a very appropriate and suitable for this movie. This story portrays two single adults that are to become caregivers to their friend's girl if their mutual best friends die in an accident. Though Holly Berenson (Katherine Heigl) and Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel) don't get along very well, they are determined to figure out their problems for the sake of baby Sophie.After a nightmare blind date, Holly and Eric swore not to see each other again. Their very best friends had a baby and appointed them as the as the baby's guardians in an unexpected case of their death. The unexpected event occurred and the ""enemies"" has to raise their friend's baby together. There are many obstacles, ups and downs, and problems that they try to fix and work out...The amazing film by Warner Bros. Picture has great acting pretrial. Ian Deitchman and Kristen Rust Robinson wrote this movie beautifully with touches of seriousness, silliness, and humor. The cast really fit their characters. Whether they were parents, friends, enemies, or work addicted, it really showed throughout the movie. Not only was the acting pretrial phenomenal, but so were the visual effects! The scene when little Sophie is about to take her first steps really shows how much Holly and Eric care for her. They both want to be there every step of the way for her since her parents can't be. If that means putting everything they had before this ""new"" life behind them in order for her to be there for Sophie, they will. That scene really sets the mood and feeling of the new ""family"".The main theme of the film is most definitely survival through loads of struggles. The fact that your two very best friends dies in a car crash is hard, but now, in addition to their death, you have been chosen to be their child's godparents is even tougher. On top of all of that, you have to do it with the person you despise the most! Although life throws hardships at you, we learn that you can't let that bring you down.

Most of what I see are ovies that make you wonder why they were ever made:  bratuitous sex, excessive violence that adds nothing to the story, terrible script and characterization and attrocious acting.  If like me you no longer watch television because you can't stand the advertisements, you will suffer for the first ten minutes the disk plays.  Live with it an denjoy the show when it eventually comes on.I am no authority on the thesbian arts, but this seems very well acted.  Special effects are minimal (I saw no evidence of any) which may turn you off.  Basic story is this:  a young couple with an infant daughter make out wills in which they state in the event of both parents dying ast one, the guardianship of the child is to be split between a male and female friend neither of whom is married.  The parents die, guardianship goes to this couple who don't like each other much, and the story unfolds from there.  Humor plays a good part in this film.

I found that when you discover that the movie truly revolves around a child who's parents are killed and is left to be raised by two different people who really didn't want to be together, much less raise a child together, then you get the true spirit of the film.

Heigl is adorable and great as always, with exception of the killers, which was pretty lame. She brings beauty, emotion, comedy and similarity to the film.

Well, such is the case with LIFE AS WE KNOW IT; the very nano-second this rom-com starts to devolve into predictable, contrived mush we suddenly have Baby Sophie spit up on one of the characters, or throw food--or just coo on camera.  Alas, the viewer is smiling again, and the story begins anew as two misfits take on the task of raising their best friends' daughter.Katherine Heigl has more or less made an art form playing uptight perfectionists; here she clones that mode once again (but is she ever easy on the eye).  And Josh Duhamel is okay as the ex-jock/womanizing/immature young dude (Ashton Kutcher wasn't available?).  So with two almost unlikable characters paired with a cute toddler this film entertains due to the immensity of the story--parents tragically killed; a baby with no one else to raise her; two polar opposites coming together to do what's in the best interests of the child.  The subsequent moments are both charming and bittersweet; there is always a subliminal component of angst and wistfulness lurking.  The plot is, of course, formulaic and predictable, you can see the ending coming from ten pre-schools away, yet none of the above takes away from LIFE AS WE KNOW IT being as cute as a dimple on a smooth, soft chin.

Moreover, it would be hard to find a more contrived and tenuous premise than the one presented by director Greg Berlanti (2000'sThe Broken Hearts Clubis his last movie) and first-time screenwriters Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson. The story revolves around a tragedy, the sudden auto-related deaths of a young couple, who decides to leave their baby daughter Sophie to their mutual best friends, uptight bakery owner Holly Berenson and laid-back pro basketball telecaster Eric Messer, both of whom are conveniently single. The second teaser is that Holly and Eric have conveniently hated each other ever since a really bad blind date (which serves as the film's prologue).The third incredible aspect of the story is that the deceased couple never told Holly and Messer that they had been appointed the baby's legal guardians, and the fourth contrivance is that they must live together in their friends' upscale Atlanta home, although the mortgage has thoughtfully been covered for a year by the deceased couple. From this precarious, stacked-deck set-up emerges a formulaic, opposites-attract story as Holly and Messer get accustomed to bringing up baby together, with all the predictable, sitcom-level sight gags and poop jokes one expects from such derivative drivel. The inevitable complications ensue when Holly starts getting serious about Sophie's idealized pediatrician, while Messer remained ensconced in the Peter Pan syndrome. In typical by-the-numbers fashion, the plot resolution is never in question from the outset.As appealing an actress as she can be (Knocked Up), Katherine Heigl, who also serves as the film's executive producer, has become exceedingly repetitive with her screen roles (27 Dresses,The Ugly Truth), and her Holly is really no exception save the scene where she faces the story's tragic pivot point. As Messer, Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas) is a genial leading man comfortable in this genre but not much more than that here. The usually dependable Josh Lucas is wasted as the too-good-to-be-true pediatrician, as isMad Men's Christina Hendricks who has the necessarily brief role of the doomed young mother. Sarah Hughes (I Love You, Man) and an unbilled Faizon Love (Couples Retreat) contribute standard scene-stealing bits as a Child Services caseworker and a cab driver pressed into service as a baby sitter, respectively.

They are very real and believable, and do a great job of integrating humor in the midst of a difficult and tragic situation.  However, I was disappointed that the movie included scenes involving the use of illegal drugs.  At the beginning of the movie, when the baby's real parents are still alive, the baby's father discovers that the young guys who are delivering the bouncy castle for the baby's birthday party are stoned.  He scolds them and says he won't call the police if they turn over their pot to him.  He gets the bag of pot and, after the delivery guys walk away, he tells his friend (Messer) that he and his wife still do drugs once or twice a year.  Later on in the movie (after their friends die and they are living in their friend's house), Holly and Messer make brownies with that bag of pot, eat the brownies and get stoned.  This happens right on the heels of them being intimate and realizing that they love each other.  The writers could have easily made that time more meaningful --- and they should have made it more meaningful, especially since they were trying to establish that Messer's relationship with Holly was different than the shallow relationships he'd previously experienced with other women.  Instead, Holly and Messer numb their minds and laugh while watching the Wiggles.  Such a disappointment.

There is a decent balance of facing loss and life's surprises as well as the romance that builds between the two main characters. Yes, it's a little formulaic and you know these two will end up together, but it's the journey that makes it worth watching. Josh Duhamel was great and honest in his role as the lovable slacker, and Katherine Heigl did a good job as well, although I am getting tired of seeing her play this same tense, Type A character in every movie. I did like that these two had careers that aren't explored too often in movies--refreshing. On the down side, I thought they could've started the movie in a better way, it felt very flat and negative rather than being amusing, which it should have been, and so it took me a little bit to warm up to the characters. Also, the parents of the baby were very stagnant and so I hardly missed them when they were gone.

Moving from a rather shallow and silly comparison of a married couple with a pair of perennial singles into a sudden tragedy makes the film take on more meaning than we've come to expect form the actors in this cast.Bakery owner and chef Holly (Katherine Heigl)  and news broadcaster Eric (Josh Duhamel) are set up on a blind date by their friends, Peter (Hayes MacArthur) and Alison (Chrisyina Hendricks) who are married. Holly and Eric are individually Peter's and Alison's best friends and become the godparents of their newborn child when she arrives.  Peter and Allison are killed in an accident  and the distraught Holy and Eric put differences aside when they discover that they have been named guardians for the now orphaned Sophie. In order to facilitate their needs to be both compassionate guardians and still maintain their separate careers they  move into Peter and Alison's house to honor their obligation to their best friends.  Child rearing is foreign to both of them - here the movie gets a bit over the edge with potty humor - and how the tow disparate people come to terms is the gist of the film.Greg Berlanti directs, Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson have provided the script.  The acting is a step above what Heigl and Duhamel have given us before and there are some fine supporting roles by Josh Lucas, Kumail Nanjiani, etc. This is an entertaining movie and does explore the significance of friendship at times of crises.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","LIFE AS WE KNOW IT manipulates you like a marionette, tugs at your heartstrings, tries to melt your heart with a bombardment of cute baby. It gets away with it because of the two good leads and because the screenplay draws a nice balance between comedy and melodrama, and because the baby really is freakin' adorable. LIFE AS WE KNOW IT has Katherine Heigl once again playing one of those fussy, career-oriented, yet vulnerable roles she so excels in. This time her character is Holly Berensen, an up-and-coming caterer. Josh Duhamel stretches his range from playing G.I. Joe on TRANSFORMERS to a fun-loving, laid back network sports director named Eric Messer (but no one calls him ""Eric""). The story kicks off with Holly and Messer set up on a blind date by mutual friends, and the date is a horrible, utter disaster. A colossal dating no-no: arranging for a booty call later that night when your current date is in the same car with you. Holly and Messer quickly part company, quite disenchanted.So imagine their alarm when those same friends who set them up die in a car accident and Holly and Eric find themselves the legal guardians of a suddenly orphaned baby girl named Sophie. Can these two very different souls put aside their mutual dislike and their warring agendas to make a home for Sophie? Well, no, they really can't. They adore the kid. But they can't stand each other. In the parlance of cinema, there's no better recipe for romance.For the common denominator crowd, there are the baby poopy gags and the smoking the extracurricular stuff. We get the expected hijinks revolving around our couple's attempts to juggle careers and social obligations with their parenting of Sophie. Except that the screenplay delivers enough depth and serious moments to offset the silly. It restrains itself enough. To be honest, there's nothing here that you haven't seen before. But the performances carry you through. Heigl and Duhamel work really well together. The inevitable love story pays off when it suprisingly takes an honest, emotional turn down the road. And you have to appreciate the neat little touches brought about by a supporting cast which features odd neighbors, a teen (pre-teen?) baby whisperer, and a social worker who develops a case of slow burn hysterics. Josh Lucas also shows up as a hunky pediatrician, not that anyone feels threatened. LIFE AS WE KNOW IT is a romantic comedy as we know it. And, I guess, sometimes, there's comfort in familiarity, if the execution is right, if the two leads are compatible, if the baby is all kinds of huggable.

To make it easier, the premise includes a mortgage-free fully-furnished mansion, non-involved family members of the deceased, comfy neighbors, a helpful CPS agent, plus each Godparent is blessed with good looks, cool lifestyle, and an enviable job. Even better, the set styling was gorgeous, and the orphaned child was a cutie pie. So, it should have been easy to make this film work, right? No, not this time.  Not only are the 2 main actors too old for this script, but each insisted the audience pay attention to them personally and not to the film's story.  For example, the dialogue had these 2 speaking and behaving as if they were, oh, around 20 years old, which I take from the apparent age of the actors, they are not.  Also as her contribution, Ms.Hiegl apparently decided to go all out and do her own makeup for this film.  She insisted on piling on enough hair highlighting, and eye and lip makeup to make her look like something right out of ""Toddlers and Tiaras"".  Owwww, it hurt to watch! Those lips, those eyes...please put them back in the bottle!!  And wait, just in case you weren't giving her enough attention, Ms. Hiegl consistently overacted every scene.  Of course, she probably doesn't realize when people do this in real life, other people avoid them.  To Mr. Duhamel's credit, while not being able to avoid Ms. Hiegl's hammy antics, he gamely responded with his own version of hamming and overacting.  Thankfully, he did it wearing minimal highlighting and face makeup or I would've had to shut the movie off.

The main characters are three-dimensional and well-cast. Though not laugh out-loud funny in most scenes, there is enough humor thrown in to make the subject matter less intense. Not pure comedy, or drama, also not pure chick flick. Enough deep issues and emotions play out that the movie grabbed my emotions and heart.A few cheesy moments make their way into the movie...one in particular is a drug thread that ends up falling flat, though it likely supposed to play as a light-hearted moment. There are a group of neighbors that add annoyingly funny moments throughout the film. Language is minimal, the F-Bomb makes few appearances, the most memorable is a whispered fight. Messer is a new-girl-a-night kind of a guy so there are plenty of comments about his tom-catting ways, though the sex scenes are minimal and primarily off-screen. Hollie is an uptight business owner who's rigidity makes for a few annoying minutes throughout the film as well.

I was skeptical as to whether or not it would be a hit or a miss (let's face it, Katherine Heigl's ""The Ugly Truth"" was not good...), but with the right writing, the right cast, and the right on-screen chemistry, this movie was great! We all know that some people are good together and some people are just terrible together. Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel have great chemistry together on-screen. Watching their characters blossom throughout the story as individuals and *SPOILER ALERT* as a couple and as impromptu parents was amazing. I laughed, I cried, I loved this movie. Like any good dramedy, we watched the characters make both wise and foolish decisions and their outcomes, only to have them realize what they needed to do to be happy. I certainly appreciated that the movie was not overly sex-filled, nor too much cursing, the one instance of the ""F-WORD"" was whispered during an argument, not near the child. (While I am not a fan of swearing or any sort of vulgarity, I can tolerate it for the sake of a good story)I loved the neighbors (not that I would ever really want my neighbors to be like that (ogling my man, etc....) but they certainly had their cute and charming moments.) and their respect of Holly (Heigl) and Messer (Duhamel) being the guardians/parents of their best friends' child.Fyi, the casting of this movie was GREAT!

It seemed realistic about a tragic, unlikely, the one you hope never happens to you, situation.  So there were poop jokes:  that's what babies do and to a non-parent suddenly changing an over-filled diaper, that can be a shock.  That Hollie is so uptight while Messer so easy-going is totally believeable, it could have been the other way around, and brings fine tension to the story.  One thing that is never doubted and a value I think propels the plotline is that Sophie is loved and treasured.

Well, this movie.Sorry I can't go deeper than that. I liked it; I'd watch it again. It's Katherine Heigl-- everything she does is entertaining, and she's adorable, and way talented. It's a rom-com; we don't watch them to ponder deep mysteries of existence-- at least I don't. It's an escape for a few.Having said that, I also want to add that the arguments between the two seemed more real/less staged than I've seen before in other movies; almost felt like I was eavesdropping in a few spots. But I blinked, and he had gone from womanizer to a man in love in about the time it takes to sneeze. And then they all lived happily ever after.Katherine Heigl has only begun to show us what she can do; I predict there will be much more in the future. Can't wait to see what she does next.

Its sad when that happens, especially when the premise is a good one. I remember watching the trailer for LIFE AS WE KNOW IT and thinking it had potential. Katherine Heigl has starred on TV's GREY'S ANATOMY and KNOCKED UP. Josh Duhamel was in TRANSFORMERS and the TV show LAS VEGAS. These are two attractive stars in a romantic comedy so what could go wrong? Unfortunately several things.The story revolves around Holly Berenson (Heigl) and Eric Messer (Duhamel). Originally set up on a blind date that goes terribly wrong in mere minutes, the two see each other in passing when invited to their best friends family events. Each is so close to one or the other that their friends make them godparents of their daughter Sophie. Then tragedy occurs when the unthinkable happens. Their friends die in a car accident and suddenly Holly and Messer find themselves the custodian of Sophie. Unfortunately their friends never gave any details to either of them about this plan.Now Holly and Messer find themselves in unknown territory. To begin with neither of them knows anything about raising a child.They also discover that there are no family members who can take care of young Sophie with any caring. One cousin has nine children of his own to worry about and Sophie's grandfather takes his oxygen with him as well as being able to do not much of anything.Then there's their careers to think of. Holly is in the early stages of a successful bakery/catering business about to add a restaurant to her building. Messer is a television technician who works the board for local sports events in Atlanta. But the two of them work out schedules on a board and do their best, both deeply caring about Sophie and what is good for her.But the best laid plans have a tendency to find problems. Toss into the mix a gaggle of neighbors who seem to be in the know on most everything and flirtatious with Messer as well as a social worker who must approve of the pair with several surprise visits and the recipe for disaster is just around the corner.The standard problems arrive in the form of typical TV sitcom fashion. Poop jokes are plentiful and jealousy develops between the two although they're not the least bit romantically involved. Messer brings in one date after another and Holly seems to have found a love interest in Sophie's pediatrician Sam (Josh Lucas), a man she's seen at her bakery before. Even though they have their separate lives, you can still see the glimmer of a chance for them to get together eventually. Okay, so maybe the glimmer isn't quite there but the standard script obviously calls for it and you know its coming. Even the eventual possible parting of the ways is pretty pat when you think about it.Perhaps that's what makes this movie fail more than succeed. You feel as if you've seen it before. Nothing seems fresh or new, as a matter of fact it feels forced throughout. And the two characters are so one sided. Holly is presented as a woman who wants to do what's right but always seems to be walked on by men in her life. And Messer is such an insufferable jerk from beginning to end that there is no hope for redemption before the final reel rolls. You can't watch a man be a jerk For 100 minutes and believe that in the last 14 he can suddenly become a caring, selfless individual. Those moments that should have come throughout the film (and sooner than near the end) would have made him a character you could care about. As a man even I wanted to see him hurt.The movie is total fluff, lighter than marshmallow cream. The only good thing one can say about it is that both lead actors here do a great job and are both easy on the eye. Sadly both actors are also in a downward spiral when it comes to movies like this. Heigl has had several romantic comedies tank at the box office and Duhamel's last WHEN IN ROME tanked as well. One can only hope that both of them can find the perfect vehicle to resurrect their careers before movies like this one turn them into actors that folks will one day say ""Oh yeah, I think I remember them"". Both are far better than this movie would lead you to believe.",2,UNDESIRED LIFE,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,4313,"['Once', 'while', 'see', 'trailer', 'movie', 'think', 'hey', 'could', 'be', 'funny', 'only', 'discover', 'afterwards', 'best', 'moments', 'were', 'display', '3', 'minute', 'trailer', 'sad', 'when', 'especially', 'when', 'premise', 'good', 'one', 'remember', 'watching', 'trailer', 'LIFE', 'WE', 'KNOW', 'IT', 'thinking', 'had', 'potential', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'starred', 'TV', 'GREY', 'ANATOMY', 'KNOCKED', 'UP', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'was', 'TRANSFORMERS', 'TV', 'show', 'LAS', 'VEGAS', 'are', 'two', 'attractive', 'stars', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'what', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'Unfortunately', 'several', 'things.The', 'story', 'around', 'Holly', 'Berenson', 'Heigl', 'Eric', 'Messer', 'Duhamel', 'Originally', 'set', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'mere', 'minutes', 'two', 'see', 'other', 'passing', 'when', 'invited', 'best', 'friends', 'family', 'events', 'so', 'close', 'one', 'other', 'friends', 'make', 'godparents', 'daughter', 'Sophie', 'Then', 'tragedy', 'when', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'friends', 'die', 'car', 'accident', 'suddenly', 'Holly', 'Messer', 'find', 'custodian', 'Sophie', 'Unfortunately', 'friends', 'never', 'gave', 'details', 'plan.Now', 'Holly', 'Messer', 'find', 'unknown', 'territory', 'begin', 'anything', 'raising', 'child.They', 'also', 'are', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'young', 'Sophie', 'caring', 'One', 'cousin', 'nine', 'children', 'own', 'worry', 'about', 'Sophie', 'grandfather', 'oxygen', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'not', 'much', 'anything.Then', 'careers', 'think', 'Holly', 'early', 'stages', 'successful', 'bakery/catering', 'business', 'add', 'restaurant', 'building', 'Messer', 'television', 'technician', 'who', 'board', 'local', 'sports', 'events', 'Atlanta', 'two', 'work', 'out', 'schedules', 'board', 'do', 'best', 'deeply', 'caring', 'Sophie', 'what', 'good', 'best', 'laid', 'plans', 'have', 'tendency', 'find', 'problems', 'Toss', 'mix', 'gaggle', 'neighbors', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'know', 'most', 'everything', 'flirtatious', 'Messer', 'as', 'well', 'social', 'worker', 'who', 'must', 'approve', 'pair', 'several', 'surprise', 'visits', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'just', 'corner.The', 'standard', 'problems', 'arrive', 'form', 'typical', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'fashion', 'Poop', 'jokes', 'are', 'plentiful', 'jealousy', 'develops', 'two', ""'re"", 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Messer', 'one', 'date', 'Holly', 'have', 'found', 'love', 'interest', 'Sophie', 'pediatrician', 'Sam', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'man', 'seen', 'bakery', 'Even', 'have', 'separate', 'lives', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'glimmer', 'chance', 'get', 'together', 'eventually', 'Okay', 'so', 'maybe', 'glimmer', ""n't"", 'quite', 'standard', 'script', 'obviously', 'know', 'coming', 'Even', 'eventual', 'possible', 'parting', 'ways', 'pretty', 'pat', 'when', 'think', 'it.Perhaps', 'what', 'movie', 'more', 'succeed', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Nothing', 'fresh', 'new', 'matter', 'fact', 'forced', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'one', 'sided', 'Holly', 'presented', 'woman', 'who', 'do', 'what', ""'s"", 'right', 'always', 'be', 'walked', 'men', 'life', 'Messer', 'such', 'insufferable', 'jerk', 'beginning', 'end', 'hope', 'redemption', 'final', 'reel', 'rolls', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'man', 'be', 'jerk', '100', 'minutes', 'believe', 'last', '14', 'can', 'suddenly', 'become', 'caring', 'selfless', 'individual', 'moments', 'should', 'have', 'come', 'film', 'sooner', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'character', 'could', 'care', 'about', 'man', 'even', 'wanted', 'see', 'hurt.The', 'movie', 'total', 'fluff', 'lighter', 'marshmallow', 'cream', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'lead', 'actors', 'here', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'are', 'easy', 'eye', 'Sadly', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'downward', 'spiral', 'when', 'movies', 'Heigl', 'had', 'several', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'tank', 'box', 'office', 'Duhamel', 'last', 'WHEN', 'IN', 'ROME', 'tanked', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'can', 'find', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'resurrect', 'careers', 'movies', 'one', 'turn', 'actors', 'folks', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'say', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'think', 'remember', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'would', 'lead', 'believe']",N/A

In ""Life as We Know It"", actors sounded as real as life would bring.A couple with a newborn baby and a minor babysitter died accidentally in a car accident, while their lucky baby was left the to the minor. Luckily or not, the couple had no one else to care for their baby in case of their death but their two friends. The two friends, who could not make ends meet in their own rights, were suddenly turned to be the only life support for the orphan baby. Each of the two adults has his or her perception of what life should be. The woman expected prestige, good look, and wealth from her future lover to be. The man needed easy going, care free partner. With such conflicting persona, the caring for a strange baby compounded the struggle of the already troubled adults.With each's unrealistic expectation, the only remaining option was facing the bitter reality of jealousy, envy, and loneliness.The transient love affair between the woman and her pediatrician sounded as realistic as it gets.

It exposes plot errors that will ruin the movie for you.I was relieved to see that this movie was disliked when it was first released (4.6 out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes.) I would have been disappointed if this was a highly rated film and maybe I just didn't get it. Unfortunately, I picked this movie as one that my spouse and I could watch together and it was a mistake. We both found the plot to take twists and turns that were implausible.The issue was not that two God parents could end up as full time parents. That is very rare, but movies are about the unusual and/or extraordinary, so building a script around that premise was good, but the male in this movie was written to be too macho and stereotypical. The male is written to be a carefree, man-whore, but he is slammed into the role of being a good parent through weak and implausible scenes that give the audience whiplash. He starts looking he might have a trace of fatherhood in him when he suddenly is offered a job in another major market. He decides to leave his alleged love and responsibility behind to chase the job, which is a major statement about his commitment. The movie then attempts to erase his abandonment in two scenes that make you wonder whether he has a split personality disorder or just the attention span of a gnat. In either case he's not someone who should be raising a child.Other plot elements (the joint ownership of the house that she attempts to sell without his approval, to name one) make the movie have all the quality in plot development (writing and editing) that one would expect in a 1970's porn film. The romantic relationship she has with the Pediatrician ends so abruptly that I have to wonder if he was really a married man who was stringing her along and took the first excuse to bail out.This movie is a Romantic Comedy that could have been great, but it's not.",2,"Life as we know it in a badly written, lame parallel universe, maybe",1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,1937,"['WARNING', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'review', 'intend', 'watching', 'movie', 'plot', 'errors', 'will', 'ruin', 'movie', 'you.I', 'was', 'relieved', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'disliked', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', '4.6', '10', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'was', 'highly', 'rated', 'film', 'maybe', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Unfortunately', 'picked', 'movie', 'one', 'spouse', 'could', 'watch', 'together', 'was', 'mistake', 'found', 'plot', 'take', 'twists', 'turns', 'were', 'implausible.The', 'issue', 'was', 'not', 'two', 'God', 'parents', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'full', 'time', 'parents', 'very', 'rare', 'movies', 'are', 'unusual', 'and/or', 'extraordinary', 'so', 'building', 'script', 'premise', 'was', 'good', 'male', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'be', 'too', 'macho', 'stereotypical', 'male', 'written', 'be', 'carefree', 'man-whore', 'slammed', 'role', 'being', 'good', 'parent', 'weak', 'implausible', 'scenes', 'give', 'audience', 'whiplash', 'looking', 'might', 'have', 'trace', 'fatherhood', 'when', 'suddenly', 'offered', 'job', 'major', 'market', 'leave', 'alleged', 'love', 'responsibility', 'chase', 'job', 'major', 'statement', 'commitment', 'movie', 'then', 'erase', 'abandonment', 'two', 'scenes', 'make', 'wonder', 'split', 'personality', 'disorder', 'just', 'attention', 'span', 'gnat', 'case', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'raising', 'child.Other', 'plot', 'elements', 'joint', 'ownership', 'house', 'sell', 'approval', 'name', 'one', 'make', 'movie', 'have', 'quality', 'plot', 'development', 'writing', 'editing', 'one', 'would', 'expect', '1970', 'porn', 'film', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Pediatrician', 'ends', 'so', 'abruptly', 'have', 'wonder', 'was', 'really', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'stringing', 'along', 'took', 'first', 'excuse', 'bail', 'out.This', 'movie', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'not']",N/A

1306985,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002ZG989G,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[12, 20]","I laughed while watching ""Life as We Know It"", the newest Kathryn Heigl vehicle. Heigl has a unique sort of movie star look and evokes memories of some of the stars of the 50s and 60s. In fact, ""Life"" seems like a movie Doris Day might have made. I am not a huge fan of Doris Day's films.But after watching this film, I became depressed. ""Life"" is a forthy, frivolous little confection but it is also a film you will instantly forget. I find it a little sad when people make one film after another, films that do nothing to challenge their skills or showcase their talents.Holly (Kathryn Heigl) owns a small bakery in Atlanta. Her friends fix her up on a blind date with Messer (Josh Duhamel), an editor of live sports telecasts. They are completely wrong for each other and don't get along at all. In fact, they instantly hate each other. Their friends, Allison and Peter (Christina Hendricks, TV's ""Mad Men"" and Hayes MacArthur) have a baby, Sophie, and name Holly and Messer as the baby's god-parents. This forces Holly and Messer to spend time with one another at Sophie's birthday parties (Holly is a baker and brings elaborate cakes) and other family events One night, Holly gets a phone call and learns her two friends were killed in a car accident. She and Messer soon learn they are the designated guardians and reluctantly try to raise Sophie, based on their friend's last wishes.In reading this synopsis, you can probably guess just about every ""twist and turn"", if such obvious moments can be labeled as such. This is always a problem in my eyes. Yes, the familiar is welcome in some circumstances, but while watching a film or television show, familiarity usually leads to boredom.There are some funny moments and some funny observations, but they seem too forced, too sitcomy and too few and far between. The film is directed by Greg Berlanti, who comes from television. He is currently one of the producers of the new television series ""No Ordinary Family"", which is better than this film. When someone comes from a television background, you hope they will use the opportunity to make a film to push for something different and better, something more challenging. But ""Life"" plays like a sitcom or dramedy. When Messer is faced with a problem, he is saddled with Sophie when he has an opportunity to direct his first sports broadcast, his solution plays out like something you would see on CBS on Monday night. It is not necessarily something you want to pay $11 or more to experience in a theater.I have seen a number of Kathryn Heigl's films and I have always laughed at her performances. Given the fact she and her mother serve as Executive Producer on her films, she is clearly trying to model her career after the comedy stars of yesteryear. She seems to want to be the next Katharine Hepburn or the next Rosalind Russell. Is she as good as either of these classic actresses? No way, but she holds some promise.What I find disappointing is that her films are so mediocre. This seems to be the result of everyone associated with the films; the studio okaying the film, the writer(s) who provide the predictable 'madcap"" story, the director who can't make the film something new and interesting. But most importantly, the fault lies with Heigl herself. If, as Executive Producer, she doesn't push the people working on the project to produce something interesting, who will? I still think she holds promise, I am still waiting for a truly memorable film role, but I won't be waiting for much longer.Josh Duhamel is also extremely likable but he also hasn't delivered on the promise many believe he has shown. A former soap actor (""All My Children""), he then starred on ""Las Vegas"" leading to a role in a surprisingly good romantic comedy called ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"". The ""Transformers"" films follow, one good and one bad. Maybe the third will be the charm. But it is difficult for him to stand out amid all of the cacophony and destruction of these mega-budget films. His last few films have been disappointing. In ""Life"", Messer is a mess and he doesn't realize it. But you know that over the course of the film, he will learn what is important in life and he will become a better person. This doesn't come as a surprise does it?Josh Lucas, also once a promising actor who is extremely charismatic, plays the guy Holly is interested in and attracted to. He is completely the opposite of Messer, a successful pediatrician who does everything possible to woo the caf&eacute; owner, he doesn't stand a chance. What happened to his career? Wow! He is now relegated to playing the guy Kathryn Heigl doesn't want or end up with?And when you see one film after another in which people just don't move forward, that is truly depressing. And forgettable. What was the name of that other Kathryn Heigl film? Kathryn who?I don't know about you, but I don't like to pay $11 or more to become depressed.",2,"Some Laughs, but Forgettable",1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,4920,"['laughed', 'watching', 'Life',
