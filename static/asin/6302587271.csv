And Paul Reubens' portrayal of one of the vampire cronies is simply irritating by the end of the movie.Despite those flaws, the smart and sassy script shines through with some classic comedic lines, and the action and fighting in the movie is well done and enjoyable to watch.

Know ahead of time that the vamps are eye-rolling silly, the fashions are now dated, and it's all very light and camp. Donald Sutherland is great, and it's fun to see Hillary Swank in it.

Studio execs should always listen to the brilliant Mr. Whedon. Swanson does a job though. She has the L.A. snob part down cold. Paul Reubens as a vampire lackey is, as usual, the best part. Rutger Hauer as the head vampire was given way less to do and comes out as a really uninvolving character. Some of the jokes work well though. I laughed a few times.

It sets the stage for television's 'Buffy the Vampire' series.If you love hilarious one-liners, delicious comebacks and whacky spoofy horror flicks--you'll love this movie. It's not meant to be scary, or analyzed or anything serious. It's a fun popcorn horror flick with all the elements that make for a good evening of smiles and like, for sure, teen ha-ha's. There's Kristy Swanson as Buffy. She's the valley-girl-cheerleader-everybody-hates-her-because-she's-popular girl. She's got her forgettable boyfriend and teen wolfy friends(ie basketball scene), the loner/losers played by Luke Perry(Spike) and his pal played by Mr.Courtney Cox. Needless to say, a la any popular girl with a loser guy movie, they throw out cheesy(but funny) one liners as they fight the forces of evil. Donald Sutherland as Buffy's watcher (Merrick) is funny and creepy(kinda) in a good way.Rutger Hauer as the head vampire and Pee Wee Herman as his sidekick have some unforgettable scenes that make you laugh out loud!If I remember correctly, there is also Hilary Swank, and Ben Affleck in this movie.

321490,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6302587271,calvinnme,"[7, 8]","I first saw this movie back in 1992 when it was first released, and I thought it was good campy fun, nothing more. When I began watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV series, and saw Joss Whedon's true vision for the story, I realize he must have been furious at how the studio basically rewrote his script. If you are a Buffy fan and you have never seen the movie, it is worthwhile from a historical standpoint to see all of the contrasts. The movie's Buffy, played by Kristy Swanson, is a tall large girl as opposed to Sarah Michelle Gellar's petite Buffy. In the movie, Buffy's mother is a boozing socialite with little time or patience for Buffy and their family appears affluent, as opposed to TV's all-American middle-class mom Joyce. Also in the movie, all victims of vampires become vampires themselves and when vampires are ""staked"" they do not turn to dust as they do in the series, but leave behind a pesky corpse. Of course, the watcher who first tells Buffy of her calling is not the Giles of the series, but regardless of that, he does not have any of the characteristics of a watcher as we have come to know them on the series. Also, the lead vampire, played by Rutger Hauer, is not the least bit scary. Instead he is more like a villain out of the equally campy Batman TV series. There is also no mention of vampires lacking a soul. There are a few moments in the movie, though, that have at least the ring of Whedon's brand of humor. What comes to my mind in that category is after Buffy has staked a large number of teen vampires that have invaded her high school dance, the principal is going around putting detention slips on all of the staked teen vampires' corpses as punishment for disrupting the event. This seems very much like something principal Snyder of Sunnydale high school would have done.",3,Campy movie shows the origin of Buffy,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,1823,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'back', '1992', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'campy', 'fun', 'nothing', 'more', 'When', 'began', 'watching', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'TV', 'series', 'saw', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'true', 'vision', 'story', 'realize', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'furious', 'how', 'studio', 'basically', 'rewrote', 'script', 'are', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'historical', 'standpoint', 'see', 'contrasts', 'movie', 'Buffy', 'played', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'tall', 'large', 'girl', 'opposed', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'petite', 'Buffy', 'movie', 'Buffy', 'mother', 'boozing', 'socialite', 'little', 'time', 'patience', 'Buffy', 'family', 'affluent', 'opposed', 'TV', 'all-American', 'middle-class', 'mom', 'Joyce', 'Also', 'movie', 'victims', 'vampires', 'become', 'vampires', 'when', 'vampires', 'are', 'staked', 'do', 'not', 'turn', 'dust', 'do', 'series', 'leave', 'pesky', 'corpse', 'course', 'watcher', 'who', 'first', 'Buffy', 'calling', 'not', 'Giles', 'series', 'regardless', 'not', 'have', 'characteristics', 'watcher', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'series', 'Also', 'lead', 'vampire', 'played', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'scary', 'Instead', 'more', 'villain', 'equally', 'campy', 'Batman', 'TV', 'series', 'also', 'mention', 'vampires', 'lacking', 'soul', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'movie', 'though', 'have', 'least', 'ring', 'Whedon', 'brand', 'humor', 'What', 'mind', 'category', 'Buffy', 'staked', 'large', 'number', 'teen', 'vampires', 'have', 'invaded', 'high', 'school', 'dance', 'principal', 'going', 'putting', 'detention', 'slips', 'staked', 'teen', 'vampires', 'corpses', 'punishment', 'disrupting', 'event', 'very', 'much', 'something', 'principal', 'Snyder', 'Sunnydale', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'have', 'done']",N/A
321491,A1OZFMJ2AD2R41,6302587271,Furiae,"[6, 7]","This movie was Joss Whedon's first attempt at Buffy.  He had a vision.  His vision was of a little blonde girl, a cheerleader by the name of Buffy who is the most inconceivable person you could imagine for a wonder-womanish character, slaying big bad vampires.  This Buffy girl would stand against vampires like they were nothing but irritating gnats.  She'd be more concerned about not being prom queen or breaking a nail than a deadly demon looming over her, because, let's face it- she's the slayer and vampires don't stand a chance against her.  Give her three minutes and they're dead (again, but for good).Terrific and fresh vision, right?  Yes, it is!  But... the initial vision was drowned out by too many other ""visions.""  The director had her own vision, Donald Sutherland had his own vision, and Twentieth Century Fox had their own vision.Fran Rubel Kuzui, the director, just wasn't in tune with Joss Whedon's style.  She may be terrific at other material, but she dropped the ball with witty Buffy.  Jokes are delivered halfway and in a corny manner.  Listen carefully and you just might hear the way Joss Whedon had originally intended for the humor to come across as, but you've got to dig pretty deep.  Whedon imagined an ocean, and Kuzui delivered a desert instead.Rutger Hauer, who plays Lothos the vampire, completely overacts and turns himself into a caricature.  It's rather laughable and hysterical.  Whedon has said, however, that despite the acting, he respected what Hauer tried to do and appreciated him in that he was one of the nicest actors to work with.Donald Sutherland plays Buffy's watcher, but he came off dry, and from what Joss Whedon has said in interviews, Sutherland was a tough guy to work with.  Whedon reports saying that Sutherland insisted on changing his lines and constantly overstepped his boundaries as an actor repeatedly.Luke Perry plays Pike, Buffy's love interest, and David Arquette also costars.  Buffy, of course, is played by Kristy Swanson.  I actually felt she did well.  A lot of people compare her to Sarah Michelle Gellar, and I have to say it's really not fair.  The original story called for the typical valley girl, and Kristy definitely delivered that performance.  Buffy was basically Cordelia, and even in the TV series, Buffy admits she was very similar to Cordelia.  She was a cheerleader, May queen, and her greatest concern was matching the perfect outfit.  Pre-Sunnydale, Buffy was in L.A. living it up as the reigning ""popular"" girl.  So, the two performances really aren't comparable.  In the series, Buffy grew up and matured.  In the movie, Buffy's biggest goal is to snag the prom queen title.Another reviewer called this movie ""Buffy Lite,"" and I couldn't agree more.  If you haven't seen the TV series, please don't judge your opinions off this movie.  The movie is a flawed, yet interesting, first attempt.  There was too much intervention from the director, actors, and the studio in the making of this movie.  Fox actually censored a lot of material, fearing the original concept was too ""scary"" for audiences (such as vampires turning into dust after being slayed).  It's also much lighter, and perhaps too valley girl.  Don't pass up the series if you're disappointed in the movie.  Critics didn't hail the TV version the best series of the year for no reason.For those familiar with the series, you'll see why Joss Whedon made a TV show.  His beloved Buffy was delivered into theaters in a clown costume, and he wanted to redo it and do it right.  The show is definitely stronger and caters to a wide range of audience appeal, not just teenagers.  This movie, however, is very limited in appeal.Unless you're a die hard Buffy fan and must have the first Buffy, rent this.  It's good for a few amusing moments, but lacks the punch of the series.  If anything, it's a good nostalgic look back into Buffy's less mature days.",2,the movie that started it all... kinda.,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,3905,"['movie', 'was', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'first', 'attempt', 'Buffy', 'had', 'vision', 'vision', 'was', 'little', 'blonde', 'girl', 'cheerleader', 'name', 'Buffy', 'who', 'most', 'inconceivable', 'person', 'could', 'imagine', 'wonder-womanish', 'character', 'slaying', 'big', 'bad', 'vampires', 'Buffy', 'girl', 'would', 'stand', 'vampires', 'were', 'nothing', 'irritating', 'gnats', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'concerned', 'not', 'being', 'prom', 'queen', 'breaking', 'nail', 'deadly', 'demon', 'looming', 'let', 'face', 'it-', 'slayer', 'vampires', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'Give', 'three', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'dead', 'again', 'good', '.Terrific', 'fresh', 'vision', 'right', 'Yes', 'initial', 'vision', 'was', 'drowned', 'out', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'visions', 'director', 'had', 'own', 'vision', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'had', 'own', 'vision', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'had', 'own', 'vision.Fran', 'Rubel', 'Kuzui', 'director', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'tune', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'style', 'may', 'be', 'terrific', 'other', 'material', 'dropped', 'ball', 'witty', 'Buffy', 'Jokes', 'are', 'delivered', 'halfway', 'corny', 'manner', 'Listen', 'carefully', 'just', 'might', 'hear', 'way', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'had', 'originally', 'intended', 'humor', 'come', ""'ve"", 'got', 'dig', 'pretty', 'deep', 'Whedon', 'imagined', 'ocean', 'Kuzui', 'delivered', 'desert', 'instead.Rutger', 'Hauer', 'who', 'Lothos', 'vampire', 'completely', 'overacts', 'caricature', 'rather', 'laughable', 'hysterical', 'Whedon', 'said', 'however', 'acting', 'respected', 'what', 'Hauer', 'tried', 'do', 'appreciated', 'was', 'one', 'nicest', 'actors', 'work', 'with.Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Buffy', 'watcher', 'came', 'off', 'dry', 'what', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'said', 'interviews', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'tough', 'guy', 'work', 'Whedon', 'reports', 'saying', 'Sutherland', 'insisted', 'changing', 'lines', 'constantly', 'overstepped', 'boundaries', 'actor', 'repeatedly.Luke', 'Perry', 'Pike', 'Buffy', 'love', 'interest', 'David', 'Arquette', 'also', 'Buffy', 'course', 'played', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'actually', 'felt', 'did', 'well', 'lot', 'people', 'compare', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'not', 'fair', 'original', 'story', 'called', 'typical', 'valley', 'girl', 'Kristy', 'definitely', 'delivered', 'performance', 'Buffy', 'was', 'basically', 'Cordelia', 'even', 'TV', 'series', 'Buffy', 'was', 'very', 'similar', 'Cordelia', 'was', 'cheerleader', 'May', 'queen', 'greatest', 'concern', 'was', 'matching', 'perfect', 'outfit', 'Pre-Sunnydale', 'Buffy', 'was', 'L.A.', 'living', 'up', 'reigning', 'popular', 'girl', 'So', 'two', 'performances', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'comparable', 'series', 'Buffy', 'grew', 'up', 'matured', 'movie', 'Buffy', 'biggest', 'goal', 'snag', 'prom', 'queen', 'title.Another', 'reviewer', 'called', 'movie', 'Buffy', 'Lite', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'more', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'TV', 'series', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'opinions', 'movie', 'movie', 'flawed', 'yet', 'interesting', 'first', 'attempt', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'intervention', 'director', 'actors', 'studio', 'making', 'movie', 'Fox', 'actually', 'censored', 'lot', 'material', 'fearing', 'original', 'concept', 'was', 'too', 'scary', 'audiences', 'such', 'vampires', 'turning', 'dust', 'being', 'slayed', 'also', 'much', 'lighter', 'perhaps', 'too', 'valley', 'girl', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'series', ""'re"", 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'hail', 'TV', 'version', 'best', 'series', 'year', 'reason.For', 'familiar', 'series', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'made', 'TV', 'show', 'beloved', 'Buffy', 'was', 'delivered', 'theaters', 'clown', 'costume', 'wanted', 'redo', 'do', 'right', 'show', 'definitely', 'stronger', 'caters', 'wide', 'range', 'audience', 'appeal', 'not', 'just', 'teenagers', 'movie', 'however', 'very', 'limited', 'appeal.Unless', ""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'must', 'have', 'first', 'Buffy', 'rent', 'good', 'few', 'amusing', 'moments', 'punch', 'series', 'anything', 'good', 'nostalgic', 'look', 'back', 'Buffy', 'less', 'mature', 'days']",N/A

Both are the brainchildren of writer/creator Joss Whedon, but Whedon has said that the film was NOT his vision of the story he had written.  That is why he created the television series - which, although at times humorous, is far more dark and serious than the film that started it all.The film tells the story of valley girl cheerleader Buffy Summers and how she is led to the dubious career of vampire slaying.  Buffy is head bimbo among the group of her vacuous friends in their high school.  With little more than what the latest fashion trends are to toil her brain, Buffy is anything but concerned about anyone other than herself.  Enter Donald Sutherland as Merrick, her soon to be Watcher (an individual who teaches slayers their craft).  Merrick must not only convince Buffy that she is a slayer by birthrite, but also convince her that vampires exist - no small feat.The story is told in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Buffy, the film, never seems to engage the viewer to the action, as though the director didn't quite know how to present the subject matter.  It's not that the film isn't watchable - because it is - it's just that it loses steam when it isn't funny - and it is often funny.  The valley girl schtick works well in this film.The actors are up to the task and seem to have fun doing it.Used as a reference for the television series, the film is surreal on an entirely different level.

In that respect, it has a lot in common with &quot;Clueless.&quot;  Like the tv show, it explores teen loneliness and isolation, but here we see Buffy's transition from &quot;typical&quot; teen to slayer used to suggest that even the popular girls who seem to have it easy are as prone to doubt and insecurity as anyone else.  I'm making it all sound too serious here, but while the tv show tends to be taken so, so seriously as a representation of teen life, I think the movie tends to be too easily dismissed.In sum, it's funny and ironic and totally enjoyable, but still intelligent and thoughtful.

She just wants to enjoy her life as a cheerleader/Valley girl when some scruffy old guy (Donald Sutherland) shows up and tells her she is ""the Chosen One.""  You cannot believe how being a Vampire Slayer puts a crimp in a young girl's lifestyle.  But when vampires (Rutger Hauer & Paul Reubens) are snacking on your classmates, what's a girl to do but grab some stakes and get down to some serious slaying.  Fortunately, there is a cute guy (Luke Perry) as a bonus.For fans of the hit television series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" the original movie is certainly a mixed bag.  The strengths of the film come from Joss Whedon's script, which takes the ...idea of the blonde bimbo being chased by the monster and reverses it so that she end's up kicking the monster's butt.  The weaknesses of the film come from director Fran Rubel Kuzui, who plays the whole thing for camp, personified by Paul Reubens over the top turn as ""Lefty"" and his agonizingly long death scene.  But if you listen past the deliver to the actual lines, you can clearly find the foundation for the Buffy character on television.Donald Sutherland lends a certain amount of weight to the proceedings as Buffy's Watcher, but Rutger Hauer's considerable presence is lost in his campy Vampire King.  What looks the most out of place is the fighting style of Kristy Swanson as Buffy, which combines martial arts with gymnastics and cheerleading, which, again, fits more into the camp style of the film.  Ultimately the direction overwhelms the promise of the script and we are left with basically a one-joke film that does not get too far off the ground.

Luke Perry's presence is just too big for this film. I'm not a big fan of his which might be why I didn't really enjoy this movie. Plus, this is the early stages of Buffy in development by Joss Whedon and it was geared to be more of a SPOOF on horror rather than what the show is today. He's truly grown as a writer now, and you can see bits of his brilliance in this film, but not enough to fall in love with it. This movie is why I was scared to watch the series when it first came out because I thought it would be just as bad as this movie.

321500,A16QODENBJVUI1,6302587271,Robert Moore,"[144, 166]","Joss Whedon was so upset with the way things were going on the set of the movie, for which he wrote the screenplay but over which he exercised no artistic control, that he walked off the set. Indeed, this is a very hard movie to watch today after the TV series. I did, in fact, moderately enjoy the movie when it first came out. I actually appreciated and enjoyed the absurd tension contained in the title, an airhead bimbo cheerleader called upon to be her generation's vampire slayer. But viewed today, the movie isn't terribly successful, and is in fact made much worse by the genius of the television series. It isn't just a question of Sarah Michelle Gellar being more appealing in the title role than Kristy Swanson (though SMG's much smaller stature increases the paradox of a tiny girl beating up large, supernaturally strong vampires) or the movie missing all the familiar characters of the show; the movie is almost completely devoid of its own style, look, and feel. Although the TV series started off on a tiny budget, it instantly had a compelling look and visual style that the movie completely lacks. Furthermore, on TV they managed a coolness and hipness that the movie never comes close to. Unfortunately, the series has pretty much reduced the movie to a curio.Many talk of the movie falling short of Joss Whedon's vision in writing the original script. Actually, overall the plot isn't too terribly different. Buffy doesn't burn down the gym at the end in the movie as Whedon wrote, but while there are many stylistic differences, many of the main plot elements were retained. I find the main difference between the movie and the series to be in the ""how"" they tell the story rather than the ""what"" in the story. Cleverness and intelligence permeates the TV show; the movie is nearly entirely devoid of those qualities. Take the death of vampires. In the movie, they get staked and simply fall down. In the TV series, they explode, which is not merely a spectacular special effect used to great purpose, but, as Joss Whedon mentions on the DVD commentary, leaves less clean up as there are not bodies. Also, in the movie, there isn't anywhere near the emotional depth that one finds in the series.Another part of the problem with the movie is the casting. Kristy Swanson isn't bad except when compared to Gellar, but Donald Sutherland is just dreadful. He plays his part as if he were a cartoon character, with a degree of camp that subtracts considerably from his humanity. In fact, the performances are almost uniformly awful. Not just Sutherland, but Rutger Hauer (someone I have loved in many other movies, especially in his Dutch films) and Paul Reubens create one almost unwatchable scene after another. David Arquette is at his worst here as well. In fact, the vampires are both poorly conceived and horribly executed, in contrast to the TV series. Many have noted the number of performers in supporting roles who later became well known, such as Ben Affleck, Natasha Gregson Wagner, and Hillary Swank (not to mention Stephen Root, who memorably played Milton the stapler guy in OFFICE SPACE)On top of all this, the thing that set the TV show apart from most other forms of popular entertainment was the degree to which it allowed for deep interaction among the various character, something made virtually impossible by the short format of a film (and something that in the long run should prove to be television's innate superiority over film, if it can ever overcome the resistance of television network execs to produce art rather than vehicles for selling airtime for commercials--my fear is that BUFFY could be an exception rather than a harbinger of things to come).In short, while not an awful movie, the movie version of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is not the masterpiece the television series is.",3,"Well, at least it paved the way for the TV series",1066521600,"10 19, 2003",2003,3828,"['Joss', 'Whedon', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'set', 'movie', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'exercised', 'artistic', 'control', 'walked', 'off', 'set', 'Indeed', 'very', 'hard', 'movie', 'watch', 'today', 'TV', 'series', 'did', 'fact', 'moderately', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'actually', 'appreciated', 'enjoyed', 'absurd', 'tension', 'contained', 'title', 'airhead', 'bimbo', 'cheerleader', 'called', 'be', 'generation', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'viewed', 'today', 'movie', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'successful', 'fact', 'made', 'much', 'worse', 'genius', 'television', 'series', ""n't"", 'just', 'question', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'being', 'more', 'appealing', 'title', 'role', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'SMG', 'much', 'smaller', 'stature', 'paradox', 'tiny', 'girl', 'beating', 'up', 'large', 'supernaturally', 'strong', 'vampires', 'movie', 'missing', 'familiar', 'characters', 'show', 'movie', 'almost', 'completely', 'devoid', 'own', 'style', 'look', 'feel', 'TV', 'series', 'started', 'off', 'tiny', 'budget', 'instantly', 'had', 'compelling', 'look', 'visual', 'style', 'movie', 'completely', 'Furthermore', 'TV', 'managed', 'coolness', 'hipness', 'movie', 'never', 'close', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'reduced', 'movie', 'curio.Many', 'talk', 'movie', 'falling', 'short', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'vision', 'writing', 'original', 'script', 'Actually', 'overall', 'plot', ""n't"", 'too', 'terribly', 'different', 'Buffy', ""n't"", 'burn', 'down', 'gym', 'end', 'movie', 'Whedon', 'wrote', 'are', 'many', 'stylistic', 'differences', 'many', 'main', 'plot', 'elements', 'were', 'retained', 'find', 'main', 'difference', 'movie', 'series', 'be', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'rather', 'what', 'story', 'Cleverness', 'intelligence', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'nearly', 'entirely', 'devoid', 'qualities', 'Take', 'death', 'vampires', 'movie', 'get', 'staked', 'simply', 'fall', 'down', 'TV', 'series', 'explode', 'not', 'merely', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effect', 'used', 'great', 'purpose', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'mentions', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'less', 'clean', 'up', 'are', 'not', 'bodies', 'Also', 'movie', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'emotional', 'depth', 'one', 'series.Another', 'part', 'problem', 'movie', 'casting', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', ""n't"", 'bad', 'when', 'compared', 'Gellar', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'just', 'dreadful', 'part', 'were', 'cartoon', 'character', 'degree', 'camp', 'considerably', 'humanity', 'fact', 'performances', 'are', 'almost', 'uniformly', 'awful', 'Not', 'just', 'Sutherland', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'someone', 'have', 'loved', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'especially', 'Dutch', 'films', 'Paul', 'Reubens', 'create', 'one', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'scene', 'David', 'Arquette', 'worst', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'vampires', 'are', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'horribly', 'executed', 'contrast', 'TV', 'series', 'Many', 'have', 'noted', 'number', 'performers', 'supporting', 'roles', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'well', 'known', 'such', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Natasha', 'Gregson', 'Wagner', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'not', 'mention', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'who', 'memorably', 'played', 'Milton', 'stapler', 'guy', 'OFFICE', 'SPACE', 'top', 'thing', 'set', 'TV', 'show', 'apart', 'most', 'other', 'forms', 'popular', 'entertainment', 'was', 'degree', 'allowed', 'deep', 'interaction', 'various', 'character', 'something', 'made', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'short', 'format', 'film', 'something', 'long', 'run', 'should', 'prove', 'be', 'television', 'innate', 'superiority', 'film', 'can', 'ever', 'overcome', 'resistance', 'television', 'network', 'execs', 'produce', 'art', 'rather', 'vehicles', 'selling', 'airtime', 'commercials', 'fear', 'BUFFY', 'could', 'be', 'exception', 'rather', 'harbinger', 'things', 'come', '.In', 'short', 'not', 'awful', 'movie', 'movie', 'version', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'television', 'series']",N/A
