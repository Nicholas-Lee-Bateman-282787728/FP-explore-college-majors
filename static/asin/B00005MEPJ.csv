665220,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B00005MEPJ,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[57, 59]","This is one of the more moving documentaries I have seen.  It accomplishes something wonderful--takes the viewer into the lives and minds of a handful of children whose parents managed to get them onto Britain's World War II Kindertransport relief effort.After the March 1938 Anschluss, Great Britain agreed to accept all Jewish children whose care could be guaranteed, and by November 9 and 10 1938, 431 children were placed. Kristallnacht opened the floodgates, and by September 1939 another 9,354 children from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia streamed into Britain with help from 5 groups including B'nai Brith and the Refugee Children's Movement; 1,850 more came via Youth Aliya and agricultural groups. More than 11,000 children were thus saved from Nazi fires that extinguished the lives of 6 million Jewish people, including 1 million children.The statistics pale, however, next to the human faces and stories that this film provides. Viewers meet perhaps a dozen aging survivors of the trauma that both preserved their lives and separated them from their parents--usually, forever.Not all parents could stand the strain. One woman recounts how her father pulled her out of the train window as it left the station without her and all the horrors that befell her family afterwards. Each story is more painful and enduring than the last.These children endured the direst imaginable circumstances, and yet learned afterwards that far worse had happened to their families. There are as many layers as people here, all of whom made something of their lives. Yet the film is accessible to everyone--and especially meaningful for children who were themselves adopted.

665223,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00005MEPJ,Anyechka,"[4, 4]","This documentary, telling one of the lesser-known stories of WWII and the Shoah, is incredibly powerful, engrossing, emotional, poignant, and above all a shining testament to the inate goodness most people have.  The strangers in England who took these children (a number of them actually teenagers and not really ""children"") into their hearts and homes were by and large doing a kindness simply because it was the right thing to do.  Almost all of the Kinder came from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, and the film focuses on a bit over a dozen of them.  These innocent young children were asked to do something most children would find very frightening, to leave their families, homelands, friends, languages, and entire lives and start out all over again in a strange new land, with strange new people taking care of them.  The parents in return also had to do the unthinkable, send their precious children off to this strange new land, entrusting them to the care of strangers, and in 90% of cases had to say goodbye forever.  But yet they loved them so much they were willing to make the supreme sacrifice so that they might live.  Some of the Kinder were placed right away, and others had to live in temporary dormitories and holiday camps until they found people who would take them.  Sometimes, as in the case of Bertha, Inge, and their brother Theo, they weren't treated all that well by their foster parents and even used as domestic servants, but in other cases, such as Kurt, they were placed with families who adored them and became their parents in every way that counted, so much so it was hard to say goodbye at the end of the war or in the rare cases where one or both of their parents had survived.  And thanks to these people, 10,000 children and teenagers were saved from the fate of a million and a half other Jewish youngsters left behind in Europe.The Kinder featured in the film came from varying backgrounds; while some came from happy families and never wanted for anything, some of them were orphans or half-orphans and had been living in orphanages until their chance to escape came.  Their wartime experiences also varied.  Some of the ones who were of the right age joined the service during the war, and, in an incident that isn't mentioned a lot, all refugees who were at least 16 were sent to Australia and interned because they were ""enemy aliens.""  Unlike the American interment of those of Japanese birth or descent, however, Britain realised their mistake, apologised, and stopped this policy.  Some of the people they'd interned went on to join the service as well, to repay Britain for having saved their lives.  There were some who were even able to bring their parents over before the war began.  The Kinder also vary in how fondly, neutrally, or negatively they remember their experiences; whereas Bertha, the young lady who was treated rather shabbily and used as a maid, has less than happy memories about her foster family, Kurt by far has the happiest recollections.  I think Kurt and Lore Segal are my favorite of the Kinder featured, because Kurt just seemed so happy and cheerful, and Lore, who became a writer, remembered so many details about everything and seemed to march to the beat of her own drummer.The film is loaded with great archival footage, much of which will be new to the viewer.  The producers wanted to find film that everyone hadn't already seen so many times it had become clich&eacute; and lost the intended impact.  As is mentioned in one of the commentaries, even Prince Charles, at the London premiere, was surprised to see some of the film footage of his family and the changing of the guards.  Among the new bits of film footage is color footage of grafitti in Vienna; color footage of these years always has a big impact because it is in color, since we're so used to seeing and thinking about these events in black and white.  The music is also very powerful and beautiful.  Extras are two great commentaries, various photo galleries, premiere footage, a trailer, film footage about the historical artifacts used, filmographies for the cast and crew, extra interviews, and brief bios of the Kinder featured.  Overall, this documentary is highly recommended.",5,A powerful documentary,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,4239,"['documentary', 'telling', 'one', 'lesser-known', 'stories', 'WWII', 'Shoah', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'engrossing', 'emotional', 'poignant', 'shining', 'testament', 'inate', 'goodness', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'strangers', 'England', 'who', 'took', 'children', 'number', 'actually', 'teenagers', 'not', 'really', 'children', 'hearts', 'homes', 'were', 'large', 'doing', 'kindness', 'simply', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'Almost', 'Kinder', 'came', 'Germany', 'Austria', 'Czechoslovakia', 'film', 'bit', 'dozen', 'innocent', 'young', 'children', 'were', 'asked', 'do', 'something', 'most', 'children', 'would', 'find', 'very', 'frightening', 'leave', 'families', 'homelands', 'friends', 'languages', 'entire', 'lives', 'start', 'out', 'over', 'again', 'strange', 'new', 'land', 'strange', 'new', 'people', 'taking', 'care', 'parents', 'return', 'also', 'had', 'do', 'unthinkable', 'send', 'precious', 'children', 'strange', 'new', 'land', 'entrusting', 'care', 'strangers', '90', '%', 'cases', 'had', 'say', 'goodbye', 'forever', 'yet', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'were', 'willing', 'make', 'supreme', 'sacrifice', 'so', 'might', 'live', 'Kinder', 'were', 'placed', 'right', 'away', 'others', 'had', 'live', 'temporary', 'dormitories', 'holiday', 'camps', 'found', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'Sometimes', 'case', 'Bertha', 'Inge', 'brother', 'Theo', 'were', ""n't"", 'treated', 'well', 'foster', 'parents', 'even', 'used', 'domestic', 'servants', 'other', 'cases', 'such', 'Kurt', 'were', 'placed', 'families', 'who', 'adored', 'became', 'parents', 'way', 'counted', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'hard', 'say', 'goodbye', 'end', 'war', 'rare', 'cases', 'where', 'one', 'parents', 'had', 'survived', 'thanks', 'people', '10,000', 'children', 'teenagers', 'were', 'saved', 'fate', 'million', 'half', 'other', 'Jewish', 'youngsters', 'left', 'behind', 'Europe.The', 'Kinder', 'featured', 'film', 'came', 'varying', 'backgrounds', 'came', 'happy', 'families', 'never', 'wanted', 'anything', 'were', 'orphans', 'half-orphans', 'had', 'been', 'living', 'orphanages', 'chance', 'escape', 'came', 'wartime', 'experiences', 'also', 'varied', 'ones', 'who', 'were', 'right', 'age', 'joined', 'service', 'war', 'incident', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'lot', 'refugees', 'who', 'were', 'least', '16', 'were', 'sent', 'Australia', 'interned', 'were', 'enemy', 'aliens', 'American', 'interment', 'Japanese', 'birth', 'descent', 'however', 'Britain', 'realised', 'mistake', 'apologised', 'stopped', 'policy', 'people', ""'d"", 'interned', 'went', 'join', 'service', 'as', 'well', 'repay', 'Britain', 'having', 'saved', 'lives', 'were', 'who', 'were', 'even', 'able', 'bring', 'parents', 'war', 'began', 'Kinder', 'also', 'vary', 'how', 'fondly', 'neutrally', 'negatively', 'remember', 'experiences', 'whereas', 'Bertha', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'was', 'treated', 'rather', 'shabbily', 'used', 'maid', 'less', 'happy', 'memories', 'foster', 'family', 'Kurt', 'far', 'happiest', 'recollections', 'think', 'Kurt', 'Lore', 'Segal', 'are', 'favorite', 'Kinder', 'featured', 'Kurt', 'just', 'seemed', 'so', 'happy', 'cheerful', 'Lore', 'who', 'became', 'writer', 'remembered', 'so', 'many', 'details', 'everything', 'seemed', 'march', 'beat', 'own', 'drummer.The', 'film', 'loaded', 'great', 'archival', 'footage', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'viewer', 'producers', 'wanted', 'find', 'film', 'everyone', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'become', 'clich', 'eacute', 'lost', 'intended', 'impact', 'mentioned', 'one', 'commentaries', 'even', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'London', 'premiere', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'film', 'footage', 'family', 'changing', 'guards', 'new', 'bits', 'film', 'footage', 'color', 'footage', 'grafitti', 'Vienna', 'color', 'footage', 'years', 'always', 'big', 'impact', 'color', ""'re"", 'so', 'used', 'seeing', 'thinking', 'events', 'black', 'white', 'music', 'also', 'very', 'powerful', 'beautiful', 'Extras', 'are', 'two', 'great', 'commentaries', 'various', 'photo', 'galleries', 'premiere', 'footage', 'trailer', 'film', 'footage', 'historical', 'artifacts', 'used', 'filmographies', 'cast', 'crew', 'extra', 'interviews', 'brief', 'bios', 'Kinder', 'featured', 'Overall', 'documentary', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

The Nazis were just as glad to get rid of them, but they were restricting to those under 17, and were not supposed to bring anything ""of value"" with them.One little boy had his violin with him, which the border guards said was a valuable instrument and he shouldn't have it. But the escort said that he loved music, and could play it, trusting that it was true. He asked the boy to play, and he did three verses of ""God Save the King"" -- the same tune we know as ""My Country 'Tis of Thee.""The narration is mostly by people who had been children and transported, but there were also a couple of mothers who made it: one German mother who survived a concentration camp, and one adoptive English mother.One thing that bothered me was the extent to which these children had been filmed in home movies way back in the 1930s, when such equipment was only for comparatively wealthy people. Were the children transported mostly those of the middle and upper classes, or was it just that with over 10,000 children transported, a goodly number had been filmed. How do you suppose those films survived? It was never explained.It's an interesting documentary because the stories are being told by those who were directly involved, not by historians or other outsiders. But ultimately it seems rather like too much detail on many issues, perhaps because it is as much to preserve the memories for the future as to inform us today.

The story is narrated by Dame Judi Dench and shows interviews with some of the now elderly escapees, who relate, in heart rending stories, the supreme sacrifices made by their parents, knowing that they would almost certainly never see their children again. The English families who accepted the children had to put up with the strange and admitted arrogance of these German Jewish children who had been raised as little princes and princesses in their homes(and this shows in some of their photographs), and who, in some cases, took years to realize the goodness of these people who took care of them for many years.

""Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport"" is a film of such remarkable light, of inspiration, that it even overcomes the horror surrounding them, leaving us speakless, breathless, and without a dry eye.Told from the point of view of children, ""Kindertransport"" weaves a narrative of parents, fearing Hitler's evil polciies, choosing to send their children away simply in order to save their lives. From 1938-1939, thousands of children were sent to Britian, in order to live. Survivors recount their trials, their ordeals, the reality of their lives as they left their parents, and is heartbreaking.Amazingly, some of the people who took in the children were interviewed too. At first as an act of mercy, these people grew to love the children who were merely guests in their homes.

665231,A3CEK2IOEH0ORW,B00005MEPJ,Jeff,"[10, 11]","""Into the Arms of Strangers,"" covers the British kindertransport program that saved some 10,000 Jewish youngsters from annihilation at the hands of the Nazis. Using interviews and actual footage it follows the lives of some of the children as they went from peaceful upbringing to the wrenching experience of seeing their parents perhaps for the last time as their train left the station to the trauma of finding out what happened to them after the war.At the same time, this documentary is missing an important piece of the historical picture. Most of the children (the majority of whom originated from observant homes) ended up in non-observant or Christian homes. By contrast, there was a kindertransport program organized by Rabbi Solomon Schonfeld, who placed 3,000+ children escaping Nazi-occupied Europe into dormitories in Britain run by observant Jews -- yet Rabbi Schonfeld's kindertransport is not even mentioned in this documentary!This is a stunning ommission. From a purely sociological point of view, it would be interesting to compare the experiences of the children placed in the home of individuals vs. those in Rabbi Schonfeld's group homes. It would also be fascinating to find out how the placements may or may not have affected their religious lives before, during and after. And if you cannot do that, at least interview one child from Rabbi Schonfeld's group. At least mention he existed. Rabbi Schonfeld was one of the true heroes of Holocaust rescue. I was disappointed to find out he and his efforts receive no attention in this documentary.Nevertheless, the fact that lives were saved and that an emotional impact/solidarity with the children is achieved without resorting to the graphic images (often associated with Holocaust material) makes this documentary a worthwhile experience for the student, teacher, parent or interested individual.",4,Good but a glaring ommission,1160524800,"10 11, 2006",2006,1871,"['Arms', 'Strangers', 'British', 'kindertransport', 'program', 'saved', '10,000', 'Jewish', 'youngsters', 'annihilation', 'hands', 'Nazis', 'Using', 'interviews', 'actual', 'footage', 'lives', 'children', 'went', 'peaceful', 'upbringing', 'wrenching', 'experience', 'seeing', 'parents', 'perhaps', 'last', 'time', 'train', 'left', 'station', 'trauma', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'war.At', 'same', 'time', 'documentary', 'missing', 'important', 'piece', 'historical', 'picture', 'Most', 'children', 'majority', 'whom', 'originated', 'observant', 'homes', 'ended', 'up', 'non-observant', 'Christian', 'homes', 'contrast', 'was', 'kindertransport', 'program', 'organized', 'Rabbi', 'Solomon', 'Schonfeld', 'who', 'placed', '3,000+', 'children', 'escaping', 'Nazi-occupied', 'Europe', 'dormitories', 'Britain', 'run', 'observant', 'Jews', 'yet', 'Rabbi', 'Schonfeld', 'kindertransport', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'documentary', 'stunning', 'ommission', 'purely', 'sociological', 'point', 'view', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'compare', 'experiences', 'children', 'placed', 'home', 'individuals', 'vs.', 'Rabbi', 'Schonfeld', 'group', 'homes', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'fascinating', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'placements', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'affected', 'religious', 'lives', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'least', 'interview', 'one', 'child', 'Rabbi', 'Schonfeld', 'group', 'least', 'mention', 'existed', 'Rabbi', 'Schonfeld', 'was', 'one', 'true', 'heroes', 'Holocaust', 'rescue', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'out', 'efforts', 'receive', 'attention', 'documentary.Nevertheless', 'fact', 'were', 'saved', 'emotional', 'impact/solidarity', 'children', 'achieved', 'resorting', 'graphic', 'images', 'often', 'associated', 'Holocaust', 'material', 'documentary', 'worthwhile', 'experience', 'student', 'teacher', 'parent', 'interested', 'individual']",N/A

This is the story of 10,000 children who lived in German-held lands and whose parents sent them to Great Britain with the hopes and prayers that they would have a better chance of surviving the terror and horror the Nazis were already inflicting on Jews and others. Mixing interviews with some of these children and their 'foster' families with rare archival footage, this Oscar winning film for BEST DOCUMENTARY, is a powerful story of the courage of not only these children but their parents who were willing to sacrifice for them. Almost all of these children lost their parents to Nazi atrocities. Some of them were able to help get their parents liberated after they reached England. One girl was pulled out of the window of the train as it was leaving because her father couldn't bear to see her go. She survived eight concentration camps to tell her story. Her parents did not. 1,500,000 children were exterminated by the Nazis. These 10,000 lived because of the compassion and kindness of the citizens of Great Britain. According to the film, a bill in the U.S. Congress died in committee because it was determined that 'adopting' the 25,000 children being proposed was a violation of God's law by separating parents from their children. While many of the films rightly emphasize the horrors of the holocaust, this one shows the goodness of those who gave of themselves so 10,000 children could live.

Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Into The Arms Of Strangers - Stories Of The Kindertransport is one of the most powerful and emotionally moving documentaries I've seen--ever. This documentary is full of archival footage and a plethora of interviews with people who were transported as children from Germany to England shortly before World War II broke out. This film shows the incredible emotional toll on the children even though they were spared from the Nazi concentration camps; but it also has interviews with a few people who were either foster parents or ""foster brothers and sisters"" of these children; and this really is the hallmark of a particularly well done and well researched documentary.Unfortunately, when Hitler came to power life he targeted Jewish people as enemies of Germany and he did so again in German occupied countries and territories. Hitler hated Jews and he tried his best to exterminate them as people already know. What people may not know is that 20,000 to 30,000 children were allowed to leave countries like Germany and Austria to go and live with foster parents in England in the nine months before Germany invaded Poland. These children, many of whom were extremely young (5 years to 8 years) had to leave their parents and everything they knew behind and go to England. Their parents tried to calm them with reassurances that they would follow the children and that the family would be reunited; but of course Hitler and his death camps made sure that usually didn't happen. At the same time, when the children were forced to leave their homes and families behind their childhoods effectively ended.The actual stories we get in the interviews here will move you; and this is not a film for the faint at heart. We get footage of elderly men and women who recall with great pain the forced separation from their families, especially from their parents; and these adults freely admit that it was a very tough time for them when they arrived in England. Most of the children didn't know a word of English and they had to learn it; and if they didn't have foster parents waiting for them they sometimes had to eat in cold buildings with no heat while snow fell through cracks in the roof and came to rest on their food! There is even footage of concentration camp victims.Of course, there's much more to this documentary. The interviewees elaborate on their own individual experiences. One woman admits she wasn't easy to have as a foster child; and another elderly man begins to cry when at the end of the movie he tells of how he knew he had not one but two families who loved him equally. We also see what happens to these children after war broke out. The Kindertransport stopped and the British government sent many foreigners away to another country although the outcry from the British public eventually reversed that policy. Want to know a whole lot more--watch the film and find out!The DVD comes with about five extra interviews; and that's very good. There is also an optional commentary with producer Deborah Oppenheimer and writer/director Mark Jonathan Harris. There's a second commentary that includes editor Kate Amend and archival researcher Corrinne Collett.Into The Arms Of Strangers - Stories Of The Kindertransport should appeal to more than just the Jewish population.

Morris showed us the power of the unnarrated documentary three decades ago in The Gates of Heaven, and has continued that trend throughout. And the strongest documentaries of the last decade have all had the same basic premise-let those who made the story tell it, and let them stand or fall on their own. It works to hilarious ends in such films as American Movie and Mule Skinner Blues, and to heartbreaking ones in Shoah. Harris twists the formula a tad by adding basic narration, but letting interviewees fill in the gaps.I wanted to see more. The story of the Kindertransport is one largely unknown in America (and largely forgotten in Germany and England, the two ends of the metaphorical railway); while there is undeniable power in letting the Kindertransport participants themselves tell their stories, the events themselves demand a bit more explication. Lanzmann was able to use a non-narrative technique in Shoah because the events depicted therein were at least partially well-known by the time he filmed; the Kindertransport is a story that could use a lot more fleshing out from an historical perspective.Not to say that it's a bad documentary; what's here is definitely worthwhile viewing, and probably deserving of its Best Documentary Oscar.

INTO THE ARMS OF STRANGERS is a documentary that examines the Kindertransport program through the eyes of the participants. No broad social commentary here, just remembrances of parents that had to send their kids away to a foreign land and into the arms of strangers so that they might survive the Nazi barbarians. The difficulty of having to provide a whole life's worth of instruction to children just before those devastating last goodbyes. A little girl wondering why, just after Hitler annexed Austria, none of her long-time Austrian friends showed up for her eighth birthday party. Parents desperately trying to keep the harsh reality of Nazi occupation from the innocent little people oblivious to the evil of man. And once the children were safe in Britain, their desperate attempts to get sponsors for parents left behind and for those lucky enough to be re-united with family after the war, having to say goodbye once again, only this time to broken hearted foster parents. This documentary is made more effective by snap-shots of the children, archival footage of Nazi Germany during the late 1930's ( a veritable sewer of anti-Jewish destruction and propaganda), and in this context, the painfully frightening sound effects of broken glass, trains and the voices of children singing in German, which seem strangely perverted - an unfortunate consequence which Germans should never forgive the Nazi's.",5,A moving documentary told by adults speaking as children,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,1778,"['relatively', 'small', 'window', 'time', 'prior', 'beginning', 'Hitler', 'conquest', 'Europe', 'when', 'exportation', 'rather', 'extermination', 'was', 'still', 'prudent', 'solution', 'Jewish', 'Problem', 'rescue', 'plan', 'called', 'Kindertransport', 'was', 'begun', 'provided', 'relocation', 'Jewish', 'children', 'Germany', 'Austria', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Great', 'Britain', 'INTO', 'THE', 'ARMS', 'OF', 'STRANGERS', 'documentary', 'Kindertransport', 'program', 'eyes', 'participants', 'broad', 'social', 'commentary', 'here', 'just', 'remembrances', 'parents', 'had', 'send', 'kids', 'away', 'foreign', 'land', 'arms', 'strangers', 'might', 'survive', 'Nazi', 'barbarians', 'difficulty', 'having', 'provide', 'whole', 'life', 'worth', 'instruction', 'children', 'just', 'devastating', 'last', 'goodbyes', 'little', 'girl', 'wondering', 'why', 'just', 'Hitler', 'annexed', 'Austria', 'none', 'long-time', 'Austrian', 'friends', 'showed', 'up', 'eighth', 'birthday', 'party', 'Parents', 'desperately', 'trying', 'keep', 'harsh', 'reality', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'innocent', 'little', 'people', 'oblivious', 'evil', 'man', 'once', 'children', 'were', 'safe', 'Britain', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'get', 'sponsors', 'parents', 'left', 'behind', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 're-united', 'family', 'war', 'having', 'say', 'goodbye', 'once', 'again', 'only', 'time', 'broken', 'hearted', 'foster', 'parents', 'documentary', 'made', 'more', 'effective', 'snap-shots', 'children', 'archival', 'footage', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'late', '1930', 'veritable', 'sewer', 'anti-Jewish', 'destruction', 'propaganda', 'context', 'painfully', 'frightening', 'sound', 'effects', 'broken', 'glass', 'trains', 'voices', 'children', 'singing', 'German', 'seem', 'strangely', 'perverted', 'unfortunate', 'consequence', 'Germans', 'should', 'never', 'forgive', 'Nazi']",N/A
665248,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00005MEPJ,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","This compelling documentary won the 2001 Best Documentary Feature award at the Oscars. Directed by filmmaker Mark Jonathan Harris, this feature (narrated by Dame Judi Dench) tells the story of the Kindertransport, a sort of modern-day underground railroad which helped save the lives of more than 10,000 Jewish children from the horror that became known as the Holocaust. Sadly, almost 1.5 million children would go on to perish in the Holocaust. Though the lives saved may seem small compared to the lives lost - the life of every saved child is immeasurably precious, and for this the Kindertransport deserves recognition.The documentary is also interesting because it contains real-life interviews with some of those who were on the Kindertransport, recounting their experiences before, during, and after the war - youngsters who were forced to leave their beloved parents and families behind for safety in England. It was harrowing to listen to stories of disrupted lives as these are children after all - it must have been truly traumatic for these children to leave behind loved ones for an uncertain future. Many of these children were forced to grow up before their time - as one lady recalls, she felt a heavy weight upon her, the weight of being the one who escaped whilst her parents were left behind in Germany, their lives imperiled. Some tried their best to get their parents work visas so that they could join them in England. One lady makes a valid observation - she responds to the question as to why so many Jews chose to remain in Europe, instead of escaping to England and other parts of the world. Well, the answer was quite simple - it was not easy to do so. Escaping meant having either a sponsor, an exit visa, a work permit, etc. and the process often involved lots of red tape. I felt truly sad to listen to these individuals recount their experiences - many felt isolated and alone even though they were for the most part accepted/tolerated by their foster families. Many were forced to move from one foster family to another - having to constantly adapt and adjust, stifle their real emotions, and all the time yearning for their parents. This perpetual longing is heartrendingly conveyed through the reminiscences and I would certainly advise keeping tissue at hand.The feature also contains archival footage. It is in color and B&W; with interactive menus and scene access. There are 2 audio commentaries by the filmmakers, a filmography, interviews with those who took part in the Kindertransport, profiles, etc. This is a memorable documentary and a must-have resource for Holocaust education.",5,"Heartrending account of lives that were disrupted by the Nazis, yet survived thanks to the Kindertransport",1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,2625,"['compelling', 'documentary', 'won', '2001', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'Feature', 'award', 'Oscars', 'Directed', 'filmmaker', 'Mark', 'Jonathan', 'Harris', 'feature', 'narrated', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'story', 'Kindertransport', 'sort', 'modern-day', 'underground', 'railroad', 'helped', 'save', 'lives', 'more', '10,000', 'Jewish', 'children', 'horror', 'became', 'known', 'Holocaust', 'Sadly', 'almost', '1.5', 'million', 'children', 'would', 'go', 'perish', 'Holocaust', 'lives', 'saved', 'may', 'seem', 'small', 'compared', 'lives', 'lost', 'life', 'saved', 'child', 'immeasurably', 'precious', 'Kindertransport', 'recognition.The', 'documentary', 'also', 'interesting', 'real-life', 'interviews', 'who', 'were', 'Kindertransport', 'recounting', 'experiences', 'war', 'youngsters', 'who', 'were', 'forced', 'leave', 'beloved', 'parents', 'families', 'safety', 'England', 'was', 'harrowing', 'listen', 'stories', 'disrupted', 'lives', 'are', 'children', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'traumatic', 'children', 'leave', 'loved', 'ones', 'uncertain', 'future', 'Many', 'children', 'were', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'time', 'one', 'lady', 'felt', 'heavy', 'weight', 'weight', 'being', 'one', 'who', 'escaped', 'whilst', 'parents', 'were', 'left', 'Germany', 'lives', 'imperiled', 'tried', 'best', 'get', 'parents', 'work', 'visas', 'so', 'could', 'join', 'England', 'One', 'lady', 'valid', 'observation', 'question', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'Jews', 'chose', 'remain', 'Europe', 'instead', 'escaping', 'England', 'other', 'parts', 'world', 'Well', 'answer', 'was', 'quite', 'simple', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'do', 'so', 'Escaping', 'meant', 'having', 'sponsor', 'exit', 'visa', 'work', 'permit', 'etc', 'process', 'often', 'involved', 'lots', 'red', 'tape', 'felt', 'truly', 'sad', 'listen', 'individuals', 'recount', 'experiences', 'many', 'felt', 'isolated', 'alone', 'even', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'accepted/tolerated', 'foster', 'families', 'Many', 'were', 'forced', 'move', 'one', 'foster', 'family', 'having', 'constantly', 'adapt', 'adjust', 'stifle', 'real', 'emotions', 'time', 'yearning', 'parents', 'perpetual', 'longing', 'heartrendingly', 'conveyed', 'reminiscences', 'would', 'certainly', 'advise', 'keeping', 'tissue', 'hand.The', 'feature', 'also', 'archival', 'footage', 'color', 'B', 'W', 'interactive', 'menus', 'scene', 'access', 'are', '2', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'filmmakers', 'filmography', 'interviews', 'who', 'took', 'part', 'Kindertransport', 'profiles', 'etc', 'memorable', 'documentary', 'must-have', 'resource', 'Holocaust', 'education']",N/A
