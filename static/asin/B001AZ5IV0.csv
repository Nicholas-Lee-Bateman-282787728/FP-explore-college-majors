1169162,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B001AZ5IV0,Artist & Author,"[2, 4]","Since this movie is subtitled, it is probably good since it is such a psychological movie that only older teens would understand it.  Essentially, it is about three fifteen year old girls who are maturing at different rates, as their interest shifts from girl friends to boyfriends at different times.  The first to start to change are very uncertain about what is happening to them, and what to do about it.  The last one starts to feel abandoned as the older ones are obviously experiencing emotions that haven't occurred to the one lagging behind.  So, there are a lot of confusing emotions happening to all of them.  If a parent has a daughter facing this situation, and they are willing to watch a subtitled movie with their parent, this would be a great way to show them that all of it is normal, and happens to them as Nature finds them ready.Then, among the two more advanced girls in this movie, we see two different situations.  One is a bit overweight and plain, while the other, Floriane, is attractive and the boys want to be with her.  But, even though she likes the boy's attention, she isn't ready for the sexual part of it yet.  On the other hand, the plain girl knows she isn't as attractive, so she is more willing to use sex to gain the attention of the boys.  Of course, instead of making her feel fulfilled, it makes her feel used.  [After one encounter, she spits in the boys face the next day.]There is one scene that I've noticed some reviewers have taken as a lesbian experience.  I completely disagree.  Floriane knows the boys want sex, but she is fearful and not ready for it.  But, she wants to hold on to the boy.  It isn't said, but it is obvious that Floriane has heard the first time is painful (as the hymen is broken).  Not quite trusting the boys her age, she asks the girl farthest behind, Marie, to manually break it for her.  She still feels safer with her girl friends.  Marie, at first, finds this abhorrent.  But, she senses she is losing the Floriane's friendship because their interests are changing.  So, Marie agrees to break the other girl's hymen in an effort to keep her friendship.  Finally a tear flows down Floriane's cheek, and she knows that one more obstacle in her adolescent journey has been passed.If you buy or rent this movie, plan on watching it several times because I don't think everything will be apparent in one sitting.  It is an excellent study in adolescence written by those who really know adolescent girls and psychology.  Unless you are offended by sexual subjects, this is a great psychological movie.",5,A Study in the Psychology of Three Adolescent Girls,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,2576,"['movie', 'subtitled', 'probably', 'good', 'such', 'psychological', 'movie', 'only', 'older', 'teens', 'would', 'understand', 'Essentially', 'three', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'maturing', 'different', 'rates', 'interest', 'shifts', 'girl', 'friends', 'boyfriends', 'different', 'times', 'first', 'start', 'change', 'are', 'very', 'uncertain', 'what', 'happening', 'what', 'do', 'last', 'one', 'feel', 'abandoned', 'older', 'ones', 'are', 'obviously', 'experiencing', 'emotions', 'have', ""n't"", 'occurred', 'one', 'lagging', 'So', 'are', 'lot', 'confusing', 'emotions', 'happening', 'parent', 'daughter', 'facing', 'situation', 'are', 'willing', 'watch', 'subtitled', 'movie', 'parent', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'way', 'show', 'normal', 'Nature', 'ready.Then', 'two', 'more', 'advanced', 'girls', 'movie', 'see', 'two', 'different', 'situations', 'One', 'bit', 'overweight', 'plain', 'other', 'Floriane', 'attractive', 'boys', 'want', 'be', 'even', 'boy', 'attention', ""n't"", 'ready', 'sexual', 'part', 'yet', 'other', 'hand', 'plain', 'girl', ""n't"", 'as', 'attractive', 'more', 'willing', 'use', 'sex', 'gain', 'attention', 'boys', 'course', 'instead', 'making', 'feel', 'fulfilled', 'feel', 'used', '[', 'one', 'encounter', 'boys', 'face', 'next', 'day', ']', 'one', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'reviewers', 'have', 'taken', 'lesbian', 'experience', 'completely', 'disagree', 'Floriane', 'boys', 'want', 'sex', 'fearful', 'not', 'ready', 'hold', 'boy', ""n't"", 'said', 'obvious', 'Floriane', 'heard', 'first', 'time', 'painful', 'hymen', 'broken', 'Not', 'quite', 'trusting', 'boys', 'age', 'girl', 'farthest', 'Marie', 'manually', 'break', 'still', 'safer', 'girl', 'friends', 'Marie', 'first', 'abhorrent', 'losing', 'Floriane', 'friendship', 'interests', 'are', 'changing', 'So', 'Marie', 'break', 'other', 'girl', 'hymen', 'effort', 'keep', 'friendship', 'Finally', 'tear', 'down', 'Floriane', 'cheek', 'one', 'more', 'obstacle', 'adolescent', 'journey', 'been', 'passed.If', 'buy', 'rent', 'movie', 'plan', 'watching', 'several', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'apparent', 'one', 'sitting', 'excellent', 'study', 'adolescence', 'written', 'who', 'really', 'know', 'adolescent', 'girls', 'psychology', 'are', 'offended', 'sexual', 'subjects', 'great', 'psychological', 'movie']",Water Lilies

The movie had an excellent display of sexual girls. This movie could not be made in the states. With feminists and helicopter moms on every corner. I thought it was beautiful display of girls. Europe is much more relaxed about sex. The movie even states in the movie how marriage is better with girls that are 14.

1169164,A28S3F43F76HSH,B001AZ5IV0,"D. Sorel ""book lovah""","[3, 3]","I have always enjoyed foreign films because they often broach topics that American movies do not dare touch! It is for this reason that I chose the French film Water Lilies which is about the sexual awakening of three adolescent girls. The main character, Marie, is a young girl filled with sexual angst who knows that there is something different about her but is not ready to discover that aspect of herself. Marie's best friend, Anne, is going through her own anxiety when she falls for a popular boy that she believes she will never be able to be with because she is not accepted by the popular crowd. Anne's frustrations are only exacerbated when she discovers that Marie has worked her way into the popular crowd by befriending the captain of the girls' swim team, Floraine. However, Marie soon realizes that she wants more than just friendship from Floraine.There is a lot of ground covered in this movie that doesn't even run a full hour and a half. While each girl views her sexuality differently, each is in conflict with herself. Though none of the characters are likable, the viewer can still relate to those anxious years on the brink of one's sexual awakening. In addition, each girl embodies a different stereotype that we have of adolescent girls experimenting with their sexuality. There is the gay girl who has yet to come out to herself, the nerdy girl who yearns for the jock, and the popular girl who wants more than the one night stands that she has grown accustomed to. Though the film reinforces these stereotypes, it does not come off as cliched or jaded. Overall, it was exactly what I wanted from a foreign film: insight and interesting issues that America believes are too controversial for their silver screen.",3,Strange but great!,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,1739,"['have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'foreign', 'films', 'often', 'broach', 'topics', 'American', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'dare', 'touch', 'reason', 'chose', 'French', 'film', 'Water', 'Lilies', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'three', 'adolescent', 'girls', 'main', 'character', 'Marie', 'young', 'girl', 'filled', 'sexual', 'angst', 'who', 'something', 'different', 'not', 'ready', 'discover', 'aspect', 'herself', 'Marie', 'best', 'friend', 'Anne', 'going', 'own', 'anxiety', 'when', 'popular', 'boy', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'not', 'accepted', 'popular', 'crowd', 'Anne', 'frustrations', 'are', 'only', 'exacerbated', 'when', 'Marie', 'worked', 'way', 'popular', 'crowd', 'befriending', 'captain', 'girls', 'swim', 'team', 'Floraine', 'However', 'Marie', 'soon', 'more', 'just', 'friendship', 'Floraine.There', 'lot', 'ground', 'covered', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'run', 'full', 'hour', 'half', 'girl', 'sexuality', 'differently', 'conflict', 'herself', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'viewer', 'can', 'still', 'relate', 'anxious', 'years', 'brink', 'one', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'addition', 'girl', 'different', 'stereotype', 'have', 'adolescent', 'girls', 'experimenting', 'sexuality', 'gay', 'girl', 'who', 'yet', 'come', 'out', 'herself', 'nerdy', 'girl', 'who', 'jock', 'popular', 'girl', 'who', 'more', 'one', 'night', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'film', 'stereotypes', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'cliched', 'jaded', 'Overall', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'foreign', 'film', 'insight', 'interesting', 'issues', 'America', 'are', 'too', 'controversial', 'silver', 'screen']",Water Lilies
1169165,A2PLMMVM7J0128,B001AZ5IV0,Ehkzu,"[67, 72]","A film review should help you decide whether or not to see the film. It shouldn't be some reviewer's soapbox. Rather, it's like a matchmaking service, looking not for the reviewer's ideal spouse, but the one for you.That's what I'll try to do here.First some filters: this is an organically-paced film in French, with subtitles, shot on a low budget. So if you demand that everything you see look like a glossy Hollywood spectacular, skip ""Water Lilies."" Even the landscapes aren't gorgeous. This is the Paris of sprawling anonymous suburbs. I'm not sure the characters have even seen the Eiffel Tower... except on TV.And skip it if you're looking for French porn shot from a middle-aged male point of view (Louis Malle comes to mind). There's nudity here but it's painful, not titillating. There's powerful romantic passion but not the kind of elaborately choreographed love scenes that pass for ""sexy"" in Hollywood.Also skip it if you're looking for a lesbian film. It's not about the lesbian community. It's not about a teen discovering she's lesbian and dealing with family and friends who are horrified, yada yada. None of that. There is at least one lesbian in the film, but that doesn't make it a lesbian film, any more than the presence of a black guy in a leading role in ""The Matrix"" made it a ""black film."" Lesbianism isn't the subject of ""Wild Lilies.""Moreover, skip it if you don't want to see how three fifteen-year old girls see the world. This is what led to one singularly dense reviewer calling this a man-hating film. Well, duh. Imagine what boys are like from a fifteen year old girl's perspective. Girls mature emotionally before boys do, by and large. Boys don't catch up until they're in their 20s (if ever, some might add). The boys' preoccupation with getting laid, coupled with their emotional tone-deafness, makes them seem just like they're presented in this movie. If you're a man reading this, think back. You were like that then, weren't you? Be honest. Aren't you embarrassed by how you behaved during your first years of dating? I know I am.Lastly, skip it if you want to cling to the belief that teenagers live strictly within the boundaries of a Disney teen comedy like, say, ""Freaky Friday."" I don't want to give away the plot, so I won't get into specifics like some other reviewers do, but some of the stuff these teens do will make you sit back and go ""Whoa...""But in retrospect it all makes sense--especially since these three teens are all outsiders: the girl boys lust after but who girls hate/despise; the overweight girl desperate for love; and the central figure, a skinny girl (think Scarlett Johansson without the curves) with the passionate depth of Juliet without any of Juliet's Shakespearian articulacy--and whose Romeo is ambivalent about her.Hollywood screenwriters love the sound of their own words (with some exceptions, like Clint Eastwood), and their screen teens jabber incessantly, usually with the language and obsessions of a middle-aged male screenwriter (""Dawson's Creek""). But ""Water Lilies""' teens talk in monosyllables, like many teens do.And Hollywood teen actors grin and grimace and in general emote the paint off the walls. ""Wild Lilies""'s teens look at the world through hooded eyes, with guarded expressions, never revealing more of what's going on inside than they have to.This looks like non-acting to those accustomed to seeing people sawing the air with their hands and chewing the scenery. To watch this movie you have to recalibrate your head so you can watch people acting like people really act.Do that, though, and you'll be rewarded richly. Pauline Acquart, who plays the movie's central figure Marie, is in nearly every scene; the movie rests on her narrow shoulders. As I said, she gives away nothing she doesn't have to. Yet hers is one of the most compelling portrayals I've seen of love so powerful it's nearly self-annihilating. But even then she never blurts out one of those totally phony self-revealing-speeches Hollywood uses to explain a character's motivations.You have to watch Acquart as closely as she watches everyone around her to pry loose her secrets. And even though her love is probably hopeless, and even though it consumes her, she maintains an admirable, stoic dignity. Her courage is equally formidable. She's not one of those outgoing characters who naturally dominates a room. Nor is she a stalker, because stalkers believe their stalkee feels the same way about them and act accordingly. Marie has no such illusions.Yet even though she has neither charisma, connections, nor the pseudo-courage of a nutcase, nor great beauty, she builds a connection with the one she wants, sometimes cautiously, sometimes boldly, as the occasion demands. She's an audacious general commanding a ragtag force in a war for someone's heart, and it's both fascinating and touching to watch her campaign evolve.There's a scene in ""Jerry Maguire"" in which Renee Zelwegger's character dumps Tom Cruise's character, even though she loves him completely, because she can tell he doesn't love her as intensely as she loves him. Acquart's character, albeit less articulately, shows she's capable of the same kind of decision--even though she also shows that she will do almost anything for her Romeo (who's a female, as it happens, but this Romeo being female is absolutely not the point).One other thing: this film shows us a few weeks in the lives of these three fifteen year olds. When the film ends, we don't know what ""happens"" later. That is, nothing is wrapped up with a ribbon tied around it. Nor should you expect the film to do so. These are 15 year olds, for heaven's sake.Some Greek poet said ""Call no man happy until his life is over."" Likewise with these girls.That said, I hope the director makes a sequel, with these same three actors. They've earned it. And they've earned your viewership--if you're worthy of this film.",4,Depths for the deep,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,5920,"['film', 'review', 'should', 'help', 'decide', 'not', 'see', 'film',

1169166,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B001AZ5IV0,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[9, 10]","Marie (Pauline Acquart) is petite, girlish, and shy, but likely on the verge of being a great beauty; her friend Anne (Louise Blachere) is awkward and somewhat overweight, and dealing with the pain those attributes engender from her peers; and Floriane (Adele Haenel) is already a great beauty, but doesn't know how to deal with all the attention she gets from the boys.  ""Water Lilies"" is the story of their interactions, their experiences, and their growth (both emotionally and physically) during a school year in France.The movie is understated, poetic, and sensual, though it would be a mistake to call it an erotic film.  Rather it includes occasional erotic moments (discreetly filmed for the most part) in a story that's mostly about teenage angst.  I also wouldn't characterize the movie as a ""lesbian film"", despite the same-sex crushes on display, especially among Marie and Floriane.  The few romantic/sensual scenes between the girls were, to me, simply examples of the kind of deep affection and strong feelings that aren't uncommon among young teen girls.  I could definitely see all of these girls, despite the intensity of their feelings for each other, eventually moving onto boyfriends when they're a little older, once their jumbled, still new, puberty-fueled emotions calm a bit.  I'm not hostile to an interpretation of the film that says it's primarily about lesbian love and/or lesbian self-discovery, but I didn't see it that way.""Water Lilies"" is a shade under 90 minutes, looks and sounds great on DVD, and has easy-to-read subtitles that can be turned on and off.  Extras are limited to the film's trailer, five minutes of deleted scenes, and four minutes of screen tests.If you enjoy understated, character-based films that don't hit you over the head with big moments, you'll likely enjoy ""Water Lilies"" well enough.

Beautiful and talented Floriane (Adele Haenel), tomboy Marie (Pauline Acquart) and plump Anne (Louise Blachere) are all awakening in different ways. This steamy pool atmosphere acts as a microcosm for teenage crushes, burgeoning sexuality and yearning.When Floriane kisses Marie passionately in the change room, it appears that she returns Marie's attraction. Soon a love triangle develops between the three girls and they must each struggle with feelings of love, jealousy and desire for each other. In this tense atmosphere, emotions are used as weapons to both test and torment.French writer/director Celine Sciamma has created a provocative portrait of teen angst and sexual awakening. Taking the audience not only into the change rooms but also into the minds of the girls brings an edgy eroticism to the film.Adele Haenel, Pauline Acquart and Louise Blachere do an impressive job of depicting the emotional fragility that comes from raging hormones and the uncertainly that often plagues the teenage years.Chris AldersonAuthor of the 2013 Lesbian Film Guide",4,Coming of age...,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1188,"['French', 'suburb', 'three', '15-year-old', 'girls', 'spend', 'summer', 'local', 'pool', 'members', 'synchronized', 'swimming', 'team', 'Beautiful', 'talented', 'Floriane', 'Adele', 'Haenel', 'tomboy', 'Marie', 'Pauline', 'Acquart', 'plump', 'Anne', 'Louise', 'Blachere', 'are', 'awakening', 'different', 'ways', 'steamy', 'pool', 'atmosphere', 'microcosm', 'teenage', 'crushes', 'burgeoning', 'sexuality', 'yearning.When', 'Floriane', 'Marie', 'passionately', 'change', 'room', 'Marie', 'attraction', 'Soon', 'love', 'triangle', 'three', 'girls', 'must', 'struggle', 'feelings', 'love', 'jealousy', 'desire', 'other', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'emotions', 'are', 'used', 'weapons', 'test', 'torment.French', 'writer/director', 'Celine', 'Sciamma', 'created', 'provocative', 'portrait', 'teen', 'angst', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'Taking', 'audience', 'not', 'only', 'change', 'rooms', 'also', 'minds', 'girls', 'edgy', 'eroticism', 'film.Adele', 'Haenel', 'Pauline', 'Acquart', 'Louise', 'Blachere', 'do', 'impressive', 'job', 'depicting', 'emotional', 'fragility', 'raging', 'hormones', 'uncertainly', 'often', 'teenage', 'years.Chris', 'AldersonAuthor', '2013', 'Lesbian', 'Film', 'Guide']",Water Lilies
1169168,A18S2VGUH9SCV5,B001AZ5IV0,Margaux Paschke,"[1, 1]","This movie takes a very personal look into three young girls growing up outside Paris.  The movie is in french with subtitles and tells the story of these girls during the summer they fumble toward womanhood.  This movie is not fast paced.  It takes a decidedly slow pace as it portrays the friendship between these girls which becomes more complex as their budding sexuality comes to the fore.  The idyllic scenery surrounding them belie the harsh issues that face them.The movie centers around the popular Floriane (captain of the local synchronized swimming team), Ann (who is insecure about her weight) and Marie (very quiet and introspective).  Ann is also on the team but she is not as comfortable in her own skin as the girls around her.  The scene where she waits for all the other girls to finish getting changed in the locker room so no one can see her naked will speak to everyone who had gym class and was insecure about their bodies, even if they have no reason to be.  Another scene shows Anne dancing, trying to show off for the boy she likes but no one is paying attention to her, in fact, she is probably being mocked by the more popular girls.  This film excels at these little moments that say so much about growing up.Maire is Anne's best friend and while attending a synchronized swimming meet, finds herself attracted to Floriane.  Is this intense feeling admiration or something more?  Other girls comment about Floriane liking girls in front of Marie.  She hopes to form a closer relationship with Floriane and is elated when they spend more time together but is hurt when Floriane only uses her as a front to appease her parents while hooking up with a local boy.  The same boy that Anne has a crush on.The complex bonds of friendship between girls, confusion over sexuality and the pressure of being labeled a ""virgin"" are expertly detailed by the director.  I would think this film would appeal more to women as the themes seem gender specific.  It is a wonderful and very personal look at three girls lives as they teeter toward adulthood.  You can feel the pang of lost innocence as you watch it.  It might be too slow paced for some but this thoughtful film is worth viewing.",4,AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT 3 FRENCH TEENAGE GIRLS,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,2205,"['movie', 'very', 'personal', 'look', 'three', 'young', 'girls', 'growing', 'up', 'outside', 'Paris', 'movie', 'french', 'subtitles', 'story', 'girls', 'summer', 'fumble', 'womanhood', 'movie', 'not', 'fast', 'paced', 'decidedly', 'slow', 'pace', 'friendship', 'girls', 'more', 'complex', 'budding', 'sexuality', 'fore', 'idyllic', 'scenery', 'surrounding', 'belie', 'harsh', 'issues', 'face', 'them.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'popular', 'Floriane', 'captain', 'local', 'synchronized', 'swimming', 'team', 'Ann', 'who', 'insecure', 'weight', 'Marie', 'very', 'quiet', 'introspective', 'Ann', 'also', 'team', 'not', 'comfortable', 'own', 'skin', 'girls', 'scene', 'where', 'other', 'girls', 'finish', 'getting', 'changed', 'locker', 'room', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'naked', 'will', 'speak', 'everyone', 'who', 'had', 'gym', 'class', 'was', 'insecure', 'bodies', 'even', 'have', 'reason', 'be', 'scene', 'Anne', 'dancing', 'trying', 'show', 'off', 'boy', 'one', 'paying', 'attention', 'fact', 'probably', 'being', 'mocked', 'more', 'popular', 'girls', 'film', 'excels', 'little', 'moments', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'growing', 'up.Maire', 'Anne', 'best', 'friend', 'attending', 'synchronized', 'swimming', 'meet', 'attracted', 'Floriane', 'intense', 'feeling', 'admiration', 'something', 'more', 'Other', 'girls', 'comment', 'Floriane', 'liking', 'girls', 'front', 'Marie', 'form', 'closer', 'relationship', 'Floriane', 'elated', 'when', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'together', 'hurt', 'when', 'Floriane', 'only', 'front', 'appease', 'parents', 'hooking', 'up', 'local', 'boy', 'same', 'boy', 'Anne', 'crush', 'on.The', 'complex', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'girls', 'confusion', 'sexuality', 'pressure', 'being', 'labeled', 'virgin', 'are', 'expertly', 'detailed', 'director', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'appeal', 'more', 'women', 'themes', 'seem', 'gender', 'specific', 'wonderful', 'very', 'personal', 'look', 'three', 'girls', 'teeter', 'adulthood', 'can', 'feel', 'pang', 'lost', 'innocence', 'watch', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'slow', 'paced', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'worth', 'viewing']",Water Lilies

There is a seedling of a great movie here, but it was never developed...and is lacking in enough dialogue to really give it any depth. Sure, some viewers may subjectively imbue the film with meaning, but from a more critical stand point, this movie is not required for such reflection on adolescence. We have all watched plenty of coming of age films already, why do we need to see this one, that is like a rough draft of a potentially good movie that never was made. There is a lot of potential here though for he writer and director, as long as more completion and explication of the motifs is executed. Like the swimming girls in the film, this movie was like practice for an actual thorough show. Also, I think this may just be used as soft core child porn by a lot of pedophiles.

The poster for the film would suggest an erotic lesbian relationship between the two pretty leads...but only the chubby friend ever shows her body.  And that's in the early scenes.  The more the film delves deeper into the desires of the budding lesbians, the more shy and chaste the direction becomes.Teenage years are the awkward years for anyone but...I think the French girls are even weirder than American girls (at least movie French girls are weirder).  Whether it's a close friendship or a lesbian desire, I doubt that many girls would be stealing the trash of their Object of Desire and tasting their discarded food.  I get the symbolism--trying to connect with her love since society/world/coaches won't accept the lesbian way--but it just comes off as really odd.  (at least, I think that's what they meant).Young boys or adult men appear in the film but they're like a stupid, rape-minded occupying force.  They either show up to violently grope a girl or dance around like savages with swimming trunks on their heads (I am not making that up).This isn't the worst lesbian movie I've ever seen.  It's very professional and understated.  But it's also very slow and ponderous.  What did all lead to?  Couldn't tell you.

1169176,A2ZHSORK1HHYTT,B001AZ5IV0,Willy D. Reviewer,"[0, 0]","SPOILER ALERT!Almost all French films are dialog heavy.  The directors & screenwriters talk the audience to sleep.  French story lines are built around endless chit-chat.  Also, most French film makers when dealing with drama, eliminate all bright colors -- they feel that it distracts the audience from the seriousness of the characters talking.  Now, along comes Water Lilies.Not only do the actors rarely talk, when they do -- it is short and to the point.  Beautifully filmed in rich bright colors, this movie is a visual experience. You watch the plot unfold, you don't listen to it unfold. You immediately understand that it is teenage love story, filled with brief moments of joy and long moments of disappointment.  The story is told through a multitude of facial close-ups -- you can see what each girl is thinking, feeling.And in the end, the main girl (age 12?) understands that what she was experiencing for a 16 yr old girl was not ""love"", but infatuation and that friendship is stronger than infatuation.  And how is this revealed?  Not through a long dissertation on what she has learned during the course of the movie, but by her being filmed alone at night next to an indoor swimming pool, and after a few moments of silence and reflection, jumping into the water.The immediate next scene when her older friend joins her, ties a pretty bow around the meaning and end of the film.Those two friends are the beautiful Water Lilies.",4,Finally The French Shut Up,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,1445,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Almost', 'French', 'films', 'are', 'dialog', 'heavy', 'directors', 'screenwriters', 'talk', 'audience', 'sleep', 'French', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'built', 'endless', 'chit-chat', 'Also', 'most', 'French', 'film', 'makers', 'when', 'dealing', 'drama', 'eliminate', 'bright', 'colors', 'feel', 'audience', 'seriousness', 'characters', 'talking', 'Now', 'Water', 'Lilies.Not', 'only', 'do', 'actors', 'rarely', 'talk', 'when', 'do', 'short', 'point', 'Beautifully', 'filmed', 'rich', 'bright', 'colors', 'movie', 'visual', 'experience', 'watch', 'plot', 'unfold', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'unfold', 'immediately', 'understand', 'teenage', 'love', 'story', 'filled', 'brief', 'moments', 'joy', 'long', 'moments', 'disappointment', 'story', 'told', 'multitude', 'facial', 'close-ups', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'girl', 'thinking', 'feeling.And', 'end', 'main', 'girl', 'age', '12', 'what', 'was', 'experiencing', '16', 'yr', 'old', 'girl', 'was', 'not', 'love', 'infatuation', 'friendship', 'stronger', 'infatuation', 'how', 'revealed', 'Not', 'long', 'dissertation', 'what', 'learned', 'course', 'movie', 'being', 'filmed', 'alone', 'night', 'indoor', 'swimming', 'pool', 'few', 'moments', 'silence', 'reflection', 'jumping', 'water.The', 'immediate', 'next', 'scene', 'when', 'older', 'friend', 'pretty', 'bow', 'meaning', 'end', 'film.Those', 'two', 'friends', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Water', 'Lilies']",Water Lilies
