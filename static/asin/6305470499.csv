466016,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,6305470499,Alejandro Cortes,"[3, 8]","** 1/2 stars rating for this movie. &quot;Celebrity&quot; features most of Woody Allen's trademarks: a huge number of characters, a lot of cameos, a lot of mini-stories that are connected between each other, and dialogues filled of whining, sexual allusions, irony and social satire. When the movie is well made, like &quot;Hannah And Her Sisters&quot;, &quot;Annie Hall&quot; or &quot;Manhattan&quot;, those Woody Allen's trademarks translate into a very good movie, with lots of fun and entertainment. But when is made like &quot;Celebrity&quot; the final result is a failure of a movie.THE BEST: Without a doubt, Charlize Theron, Winona Ryder, Famke Janssen and Melanie Griffith are the best of the movie, all of them are beautiful women and make their scenes in &quot;Celebrity&quot; more interesting than they would have been without those gorgeous actresses.Some of the dialogues in the Leonardo DiCaprio segments are funny and original. There are a lot of interesting cameos. The black & white photography gives personality to the film, in an era packed of explosions and computer generated special effects, is always interesting to see a black & white movie.THE WORST: Without a doubt, the worst in the movie is the Kenneth Branagh character, he is a great actor, but in this movie he makes an increasingly irritating Woody Allen imitation. When the real Woody Allen is the central character, his voice, attitude and physic translate into a funny character, but when someone else does a cheap imitation, the central character becomes pathetic. A lot of the scenes and situations are very, very boring and pointless.&quot;Celebrity&quot; is one of the less interesting movies of Woody Allen, it just feels too familiar, repetitive and boring.",2,DEJA VU FEELING...BUT A VERY BORING DEJA VU.,1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,1749,"['**', '1/2', 'stars', 'rating', 'movie', 'quot', 'Celebrity', 'quot', 'most', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'trademarks', 'huge', 'number', 'characters', 'lot', 'cameos', 'lot', 'mini-stories', 'are', 'connected', 'other', 'dialogues', 'filled', 'whining', 'sexual', 'allusions', 'irony', 'social', 'satire', 'When', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'quot', 'Hannah', 'Her', 'Sisters', 'quot', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'quot', 'Manhattan', 'quot', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'trademarks', 'translate', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'lots', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'when', 'made', 'quot', 'Celebrity', 'quot', 'final', 'result', 'failure', 'movie.THE', 'BEST', 'doubt', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'are', 'best', 'movie', 'are', 'beautiful', 'women', 'make', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Celebrity', 'quot', 'more', 'interesting', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'gorgeous', 'actresses.Some', 'dialogues', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'segments', 'are', 'funny', 'original', 'are', 'lot', 'interesting', 'cameos', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'personality', 'film', 'era', 'packed', 'explosions', 'computer', 'generated', 'special', 'effects', 'always', 'interesting', 'see', 'black', 'white', 'movie.THE', 'WORST', 'doubt', 'worst', 'movie', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'character', 'great', 'actor', 'movie', 'increasingly', 'irritating', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'imitation', 'When', 'real', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'central', 'character', 'voice', 'attitude', 'physic', 'translate', 'funny', 'character', 'when', 'someone', 'else', 'cheap', 'imitation', 'central', 'character', 'pathetic', 'lot', 'scenes', 'situations', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'boring', 'pointless.', 'quot', 'Celebrity', 'quot', 'one', 'less', 'interesting', 'movies', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'just', 'feels', 'too', 'familiar', 'repetitive', 'boring']",Celebrity VHS

466018,AGEIT17HENDIS,6305470499,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","The Chinese have their years named after various animals. Apparently this year for me is the Year of Woody Allen. For the better part of the year I have been watching, and in several cases re- watching films, that the comic has acted in, produced, directed or some combination of the three. Some have been disappointing.  Some, like Annie Hall, have withstood the test of time and go into the pantheon. Others, reflecting the fact that if one lives long enough, as Allen has, then one is sure to repeat themes worked in the past, sometimes with uneven results. That is the case with Celebrity. There are some very funny individual scenes that rank with Allen classics but overall we have been here before. Allen's look at the pranks and pitfalls of celebrity in New York City (his favorite locale, and correctly so) in the mid-1990's is the updated version of his less than funny Zelig that looked at celebrity in the Jazz Age.Moreover, the film has an overly manic quality, particularly on the part of the frustrated male writer (surprise, surprise) and his unfulfilled and bewildered schoolteacher wife soon to be separated so that said writer can `find' himself. The mannerisms (to speak nothing of a certain vague similarity of appearance) of the pair reminded me of the good old days when Woody and Mia (oops, better not mention that) held forth. Except here on speed. If you love black and white film, if you love Woody Allen and most importantly if you are new to the Allen genre then get this film. Others, veterans, can take it or leave it.",3,"Redux, Redux",1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,1549,"['Chinese', 'have', 'years', 'named', 'various', 'animals', 'Apparently', 'year', 'Year', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'better', 'part', 'year', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'several', 'cases', 're-', 'watching', 'films', 'comic', 'acted', 'produced', 'directed', 'combination', 'three', 'have', 'been', 'disappointing', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'have', 'withstood', 'test', 'time', 'go', 'pantheon', 'Others', 'reflecting', 'fact', 'one', 'long', 'enough', 'Allen', 'then', 'one', 'sure', 'repeat', 'themes', 'worked', 'past', 'sometimes', 'uneven', 'results', 'case', 'Celebrity', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'individual', 'scenes', 'rank', 'Allen', 'classics', 'overall', 'have', 'been', 'here', 'before', 'Allen', 'look', 'pranks', 'pitfalls', 'celebrity', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'favorite', 'locale', 'correctly', 'so', 'mid-1990', 'updated', 'version', 'less', 'funny', 'Zelig', 'looked', 'celebrity', 'Jazz', 'Age.Moreover', 'film', 'overly', 'manic', 'quality', 'particularly', 'part', 'frustrated', 'male', 'writer', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'unfulfilled', 'bewildered', 'schoolteacher', 'wife', 'soon', 'be', 'separated', 'so', 'said', 'writer', 'can', 'find', 'mannerisms', 'speak', 'nothing', 'certain', 'vague', 'similarity', 'appearance', 'pair', 'reminded', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'Woody', 'Mia', 'oops', 'better', 'not', 'mention', 'held', 'forth', 'here', 'speed', 'love', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'love', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'most', 'importantly', 'are', 'new', 'Allen', 'genre', 'then', 'get', 'film', 'Others', 'veterans', 'can', 'take', 'leave']",Celebrity VHS
466019,A1ZPKKWT79C6HW,6305470499,"APC Reviews ""APC Reviews""","[4, 4]","""Celebrity"" is one of Woody's best, and most under appreciated and also unjustly attacked films. The production is first rate, the characters diverse, and the acting -- from Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Melanie Griffith, Joe Mantegna -- as good as in any Allen film. It is a wonderful and highly observant film, that seems to offend many for reasons that no one seems able to really express, other than by resorting to vituperative adjectives and hand wringing.As far as I can tell, it offends some people because it is thought to be ""more of the same"" late ""Manhattan"" period Allen ensemble work -- pity Mozart if he had been cranking out symphonies for these complainers; it is thought to be annoying because Kenneth Branagh does what is, really, a wonderful Allen impression, Woody being too old by the time was made to play the lead in the story; because the characters are more fully developed, and so perhaps more subtle and less immediately amusing, versions of the classic Allen character types that, by the time the film was made, had become well known to audiences impatient for novelty and new amusements from Allen; because, perhaps, many solid middle American types have such an instinctive and deep seated hatred for the particular New York types that populate Allen films that this film evidently pushed the buttons of those audience members to extremes that mandated vicious opining in revenge; and, perhaps, last but not least, because Allen films tend to attract either comedy lovers who are put off by misanthropic elements, or misanthropes who are put off by overly human and flawed characters that don't live up to their notions of worthiness, or which make light of misanthropic virtues.There's a reason Woody made Stardust Memories, also one of his finest films. The raging disappointment expressed by some toward his more challenging films, and to some of his more phoned in and forgettable ones, points to the creative conflict, and conflicted audience reactions, highlighted in Stardust Memories. All that aside, ""Celebrity"" is a marvelous film, that surely deserves a better DVD transfer than it receives here. Hopefully, when the entire Allen catalog is given a much needed 16:9 remastering someday, ""Celebrity"" will re-emerge and be appreciated by new audiences.",5,"One of Woody's best, and most under appreciated films..",1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,2310,"['Celebrity', 'one', 'Woody', 'best', 'most', 'appreciated', 'also', 'unjustly', 'attacked', 'films', 'production', 'first', 'rate', 'characters', 'diverse', 'acting', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'as', 'good', 'Allen', 'film', 'wonderful', 'highly', 'observant', 'film', 'offend', 'many', 'reasons', 'one', 'able', 'really', 'express', 'other', 'resorting', 'vituperative', 'adjectives', 'hand', 'wringing.As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'people', 'thought', 'be', 'more', 'same', 'late', 'Manhattan', 'period', 'Allen', 'ensemble', 'work', 'pity', 'Mozart', 'had', 'been', 'cranking', 'out', 'symphonies', 'complainers', 'thought', 'be', 'annoying', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'what', 'really', 'wonderful', 'Allen', 'impression', 'Woody', 'being', 'too', 'old', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'play', 'lead', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'fully', 'developed', 'so', 'perhaps', 'more', 'subtle', 'less', 'immediately', 'amusing', 'versions', 'classic', 'Allen', 'character', 'types', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'had', 'become', 'well', 'known', 'audiences', 'impatient', 'novelty', 'new', 'amusements', 'Allen', 'perhaps', 'many', 'solid', 'middle', 'American', 'types', 'have', 'instinctive', 'deep', 'seated', 'hatred', 'particular', 'New', 'York', 'populate', 'Allen', 'film', 'evidently', 'pushed', 'buttons', 'audience', 'members', 'extremes', 'mandated', 'vicious', 'opining', 'revenge', 'perhaps', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Allen', 'films', 'tend', 'attract', 'comedy', 'lovers', 'who', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'misanthropic', 'elements', 'misanthropes', 'who', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'overly', 'human', 'flawed', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'notions', 'worthiness', 'make', 'light', 'misanthropic', 'reason', 'Woody', 'made', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'also', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'raging', 'disappointment', 'expressed', 'more', 'challenging', 'films', 'more', 'phoned', 'forgettable', 'ones', 'points', 'creative', 'conflict', 'conflicted', 'audience', 'reactions', 'highlighted', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'aside', 'Celebrity', 'marvelous', 'film', 'surely', 'better', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'here', 'Hopefully', 'when', 'entire', 'Allen', 'catalog', 'given', 'much', 'needed', '16:9', 'remastering', 'someday', 'Celebrity', 'will', 're-emerge', 'be', 'appreciated', 'new', 'audiences']",Celebrity VHS

He only thinks he knows what makes his partner tick, and he's too busy telling her to listen to her perspective.

I read in an Allen biography that he tried to stop Kenneth Branagh from impersonating him on set. Unfortunately, he wasn't persuasive enough as Branagh's performance was more a caricature of Woody than anything else. As for Judy Davis, who I like in practically everything, she is misused. Her personality is more exaggeration than person. It seems to me that Allen cleaved off various neuroses from his own personality, and then evenly distributed them to the male and female leads.

He's given a seen where he can smash lamps and say F**K a lot, in other words he's given a juicy role where it can appear likes he's really into it and he does it like any beginning actor would, not one original movement. The guy is horrible plain and simple. I liked Joe Mantegna a lot, very breezy and likeable and it was shot splendidly which is always nice to see.

466031,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,6305470499,Kerry Walters,"[2, 2]","This wry and devastating portrait of the cult of celebrityhood is one of Allen's most brilliant--and entertaining--films.  It isn't Allen's first effort at deconstructing celebrityhood.  ""Stardust Memories"" was.  But ""Celebrity"" goes way beyond ""Stardust"" in both depth and self-criticism.  For it must be recognized that the chief celebrity at whom Allen is poking fun is himself.Kenneth Branagh's performance as the ersatz Woody Allen is simply stunning.  He's captured Allen's nebbish persona so well that he almost begins to physically resemble Allen by the film's end.  Some critics found the uncanny mimicry irritating, but to do so is to miss the whole point.  Allen wants to show that there's a flimsiness to celebrityhood, a shallowness that all of the celebrities in the film exhibit to one degree of another.  Having Branagh ""play"" Woody Allen is just a metaphor for the smoke and mirror nature of celebrityhood.  It's all surface, and roles are interchangeable.  Identity or personal substance isn't what matters.  Getting into the spotlight for the requisite 15 minutes of fame is all that counts.Performances in the film are especially good.  It's as if the actors, knowing full well how flimsy celebrityhood is, really relished the opportunity to make the point on screen.  Charlize Theron, Leonardo diCaprio, Winona Ryder, and Famke Janssen are fabulous.  Judy Davis is less so, having perhaps played the woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown once too often.  Joe Mantegna is superb as the only person in the film not obsessed (and ruined) by the lust for celebrity.Finally, Woody takes aim at audiences--just as he did in ""Stardust Memories""--who perpetuate celebrityhood by demanding that stars be larger than life and who wind up focusing on them rather than art.  This gentle chiding on his part, if nothing else, makes ""Celebrity"" well worth seeing.",5,The flimsiness of celebrityhood,1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,1873,"['wry', 'devastating', 'portrait', 'cult', 'celebrityhood', 'one', 'Allen', 'most', 'brilliant', 'entertaining', 'films', ""n't"", 'Allen', 'first', 'effort', 'deconstructing', 'celebrityhood', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'was', 'Celebrity', 'way', 'Stardust', 'depth', 'self-criticism', 'must', 'be', 'recognized', 'chief', 'celebrity', 'whom', 'Allen', 'poking', 'fun', 'himself.Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'performance', 'ersatz', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'simply', 'stunning', 'captured', 'Allen', 'nebbish', 'persona', 'so', 'well', 'almost', 'physically', 'resemble', 'Allen', 'film', 'end', 'critics', 'found', 'uncanny', 'mimicry', 'irritating', 'do', 'so', 'miss', 'whole', 'point', 'Allen', 'show', 'flimsiness', 'celebrityhood', 'shallowness', 'celebrities', 'film', 'exhibit', 'one', 'degree', 'Having', 'Branagh', 'play', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'just', 'metaphor', 'smoke', 'mirror', 'nature', 'celebrityhood', 'surface', 'roles', 'are', 'interchangeable', 'Identity', 'personal', 'substance', ""n't"", 'what', 'matters', 'Getting', 'spotlight', 'requisite', '15', 'minutes', 'fame', 'counts.Performances', 'film', 'are', 'especially', 'good', 'actors', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'how', 'flimsy', 'celebrityhood', 'really', 'relished', 'opportunity', 'make', 'point', 'screen', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Leonardo', 'diCaprio', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'are', 'fabulous', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'less', 'so', 'having', 'perhaps', 'played', 'woman', 'edge', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'once', 'too', 'often', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'superb', 'only', 'person', 'film', 'not', 'obsessed', 'ruined', 'lust', 'celebrity.Finally', 'Woody', 'aim', 'audiences', 'just', 'did', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'who', 'perpetuate', 'celebrityhood', 'demanding', 'stars', 'be', 'larger', 'life', 'who', 'wind', 'up', 'focusing', 'rather', 'art', 'gentle', 'chiding', 'part', 'nothing', 'else', 'Celebrity', 'well', 'seeing']",Celebrity VHS
466032,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305470499,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","Despite the title and the parade of characters who can be labeled as such, Woody Allen's 1998 film ""Celebrity"" is, like most of his films, about the peculiar ability of a man to destroy the important interpersonal relationships in his life.  What makes ""Celebrity"" different is that this time around the Woody Allen part is not played by Allen, but by Kenneth Branagh.  The actor, who has been nominated for an Oscar for playing Shakespeare on the silver screen, decides to play the Woody Allen character in ""Celebrity"" just like Woody Allen.  Really.  The dialogue is all written in Allen's distinctive voice, but instead of it being said by a small, wiry, balding Jewish comedian it is being said by a large, robust, wavy-haired Irish actor with the EXACT same cadences and inflections.  Chances are that by the end of this film you still will not believe your ears on this one.Now back to the film.This time around the self-destructive main character is named Lee Simon (Branagh), a journalist and would be writer of a novel or screenplay if he can just get it done.  Having cast aside his wife Robin (Judy Davis), Simon goes looking for love with most of the women who cross his path, from a movie star (Melanie Griffith) and a supermodel (a sizzling Charlize Theron) to an actress who plays bit parts (Wynona Ryder).  Like Allen's script for this film, Lee's life is going around in circles.  He cannot articulate to Robin the reason why he is leaving her any more than he can fully explain any of his actions as he moves from one woman to the next.  As we are told at both the beginning and the end of the film, Lee Simon is a man who needs help.  The punch line to the cosmic joke is that after Lee's departure plunges her into the depths of despair, Robin's life moves onward and upward because realizing there are gaps in her life she tries to fill them and improve herself, even if it means turning to the experience Nina (Bebe Neuwrith) for some interesting life lessons.  By the end of the film she Robin is on top of her game and Lee is back where he started, and we realize this is something we have seen from Allen before and seen done better as well.So, why did Allen simply not play himself?  Because Woody Allen looks like Woody Allen.  Today he looks more like an older Woody Allen (see ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"").  To put it bluntly, no supermodel is going to be interested in him.  Thus we have the transposition of the Allen persona into the body of Branagh, who brings a manliness to the comic's neurotic mannerisms.  When Branagh drives an antique Austin-Martin as a way of helping him pick up chicks, it sends a different signal than if it were Allen behind the wheel of that same car (besides, we know from ""Annie Hall"" that Woody can't drive).  The choice of Branagh and his decision to play the part this way has a significance that extends beyond the idea that it is just some sort of a joke.  There are two many sex scenes in this film for Allen to carried them off seriously.  More importantly, if the nebbish that Allen has created over four decades of film can look like Branagh, then that is certainly something for us to think about.",4,If Branagh can play Hamlet then he can play Woody Allen,1053475200,"05 21, 2003",2003,3175,"['title', 'parade', 'characters', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'labeled', 'such', 'Woody', 'Allen', '1998', 'film', 'Celebrity', 'most', 'films', 'peculiar', 'ability', 'man', 'destroy', 'important', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'life', 'What', 'Celebrity', 'different', 'time', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'part', 'not', 'played', 'Allen', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'playing', 'Shakespeare', 'silver', 'screen', 'play', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'Celebrity', 'just', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Really', 'dialogue', 'written', 'Allen', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'instead', 'being', 'said', 'small', 'wiry', 'balding', 'Jewish', 'comedian', 'being', 'said', 'large', 'robust', 'wavy-haired', 'Irish', 'actor', 'EXACT', 'same', 'cadences', 'inflections', 'Chances', 'are', 'end', 'film', 'still', 'will', 'not', 'believe', 'ears', 'one.Now', 'back', 'film.This', 'time', 'self-destructive', 'main', 'character', 'named', 'Lee', 'Simon', 'Branagh', 'journalist', 'would', 'be', 'writer', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'can', 'just', 'get', 'done', 'Having', 'cast', 'wife', 'Robin', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Simon', 'looking', 'love', 'most', 'women', 'who', 'cross', 'path', 'movie', 'star', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'supermodel', 'sizzling', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'actress', 'who', 'bit', 'parts', 'Wynona', 'Ryder', 'Allen', 'script', 'film', 'Lee', 'life', 'going', 'around', 'circles', 'can', 'not', 'articulate', 'Robin', 'reason', 'why', 'leaving', 'more', 'can', 'fully', 'explain', 'actions', 'one', 'woman', 'next', 'are', 'told', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'Lee', 'Simon', 'man', 'who', 'help', 'punch', 'line', 'cosmic', 'joke', 'Lee', 'departure', 'depths', 'despair', 'Robin', 'life', 'onward', 'upward', 'realizing', 'are', 'gaps', 'life', 'fill', 'improve', 'herself', 'even', 'turning', 'experience', 'Nina', 'Bebe', 'Neuwrith', 'interesting', 'life', 'lessons', 'end', 'film', 'Robin', 'top', 'game', 'Lee', 'back', 'where', 'started', 'realize', 'something', 'have', 'seen', 'Allen', 'seen', 'done', 'better', 'well.So', 'why', 'did', 'Allen', 'simply', 'not', 'play', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Today', 'more', 'older', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'see', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'put', 'bluntly', 'supermodel', 'going', 'be', 'interested', 'Thus', 'have', 'transposition', 'Allen', 'persona', 'body', 'Branagh', 'who', 'manliness', 'comic', 'neurotic', 'mannerisms', 'When', 'Branagh', 'antique', 'Austin-Martin', 'way', 'helping', 'pick', 'up', 'chicks', 'different', 'signal', 'were', 'Allen', 'wheel', 'same', 'car', 'know', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Woody', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drive', 'choice', 'Branagh', 'decision', 'play', 'part', 'way', 'significance', 'idea', 'just', 'sort', 'joke', 'are', 'two', 'many', 'sex', 'scenes', 'film', 'Allen', 'carried', 'off', 'seriously', 'More', 'importantly', 'nebbish', 'Allen', 'created', 'four', 'decades', 'film', 'can', 'look', 'Branagh', 'then', 'certainly', 'something', 'think']",Celebrity VHS

In Woody Allen's 1998 comedy ""Celebrity,"" one of his characters cites that quotable quote. The unquenchable thirst for being applauded and lauded permeates this film. All of the denizens of this black-and-white NYC world gravitate toward photographers' flashbulbs, gossip column newsprint, and sound bites on entertainment TV. His cast of actresses, models, painters, writers, and producers are all jockeying to be recognizable to the public, as opposed to being recognized in their fields. It doesn't matter whether they create works of art or produce oeuvres that will be their permanent legacies--they all simply want a chance to appear on Page Six or be dished by Joan Rivers on the red carpet. (Allen shows this brilliantly during a second-rate movie premiere sequence, where Karen Duffy interviews arriving celebrities in a high-pitched, frenzied, continually growing fervor. Her hard-hitting questions of these minor celebs include insights into the weather, the rain, and the puddles. Additionally, Debra Messing makes a brief pre ""Will and Grace"" appearance as a bellowing banshee TV reporter. Her broadcasting is of a feverish, shouting, ear-splitting level.)Allen, who at one time had been hailed as a comic genius, began to make serious, European-inspired films in the early 1980s. He is at his best, however, when he makes ""warmedys"" or ""dramedys,"" movies that walk the tightrope of laughing out loud and meditatively exploring affairs of the heart and mind. In Allen's personal life, which always included the requisite relationship with leading ladies (Louise Lasser, Diane Keaton, Mia Farrow), he seemed to be following what is mandated of directorial types. His reputation took a violent turn downward with his secret wooing and seducing of Soon-Yi, Farrow's adopted daughter. With his callow explanation of ""The heart wants what the heart wants,"" Allen had unwittingly joined a pantheon of fellow May-December offenders: Roman Polanski, Charlie Chaplin, Errol Flynn. It doesn't matter whether Soon-Yi was of legal age when the romance began, Allen was branded as a child grabber.This fall from grace and the unwilling attainment of fame on a whole different level is the driving force of ""Celebrity."" Throughout the film, shallow models, spoiled actresses, high-strung editors, generous producers, and confused writers interact before backdrops of ""The Ricki Lake Show"" or ""Jerry Springer."" Look carefully and you'll see Joey and Mary Jo Buttafuco playing on a televison screen, and you'll catch Donald ""the Donald"" Trump extolling how he plans on buying up St. Patrick's Cathedral to raze it and build some dynamite condo space.We live in a world where people become PEOPLE magazine cover stories by virtue of being kidnapped, taken hostage, or victimized in some grotesque way. We lionize interns who have achieved notoriety because of their oral skills, rather than their clerical talents. (Just the other day, a 60-plus-year-old woman has come out of the woodwork confessing to being the first First Intern, having taken advantage of executive privilege with JFK.)Allen's movie delves into the whole culture of making a name for oneself without being able to name what one actually does. Kenneth Branagh, doing a dead-on Woody Allen impression, is a travel writer who has a midlife crisis that dictates he wants, and deserves, more than an occasional byline and tryst in bed with his long-suffering Catholic wife. Judy Davis is the aforementioned spouse, and she does a serviceable job as a woman who is convinced that she doesn't deserve happiness and any morsel of good fortune.Along the way, the two characters separate and divorce, then become involved with lunatics and lovers played by Charlize Theron, Famke Janssen, Winona Ryder, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Joe Mantegna. Interestingly, Theron (as a self-absorbed, selfish woman who basically has become famous for wearing lingerie on a runway) utters a prior Allen line: She admits to being polymorphously perverse, being able to attain pleasure wherever she's touched. Allen uses that same adjective to describe the Keaton character in ""Annie Hall."" (And he uses its reverse, ""polymorphously insensitive,"" to razz the Dianne Wiest character in ""Hannah."")Overall, ""Celebrity"" is not a fabulous movie. It's not consistently funny and it doesn't have the touching moments or sweetness of ""Hannah and Her Sisters."" This is a text-book movie to view, though, if you want to see how one of the most famous men in American cinema history pontificates about fame and the price one pays to attain it. It will also prompt you to consider whether mass adoration morally bankrupts the seeker, or is one already lacking in good character when the hungry hunt begins?",3,Fame -- It's the name of the

466034,A1D2AXVN20OQZD,6305470499,Marc A. Coignard,"[3, 5]","Although it has some funny scenes and a great idea behind it, this movie just didn't seem to take off for me.  Woody Allen has done much better in the past.  Even his &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; was better than this.  It was just too uneventful.  I do agree that Leo DiCaprio had one of the  best scense in the movie.  It does show that the man can act, when given  the right oppurtunity.  (Although it is debatable if his small, almost  un-important part was deserved of an Oscar nomination as a few reviewers  have commented.)  Kenneth Brannah's character was funny, but I think that  actors playing the lead in Woody Allen comedies need to stop pretending  they're Woody.  Although I've only seen two do it, Brannah and John Cusack,  I have no doubt others have as well (or will.  I really hope Sean Penn  doesn't try it out in this next movie!). I also wish Woody would stop  giving the very talented Judy Davis such insecure, neurotic roles. I think  I've seen her in three of his movies, and she seems to be the same in each.

466035,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305470499,Matthew Horner,"[1, 4]","Woody Allen has been directing movies for well over thirty years. He has also been in psychoanalysis for perhaps as long, and for several years, I have suspected that the quality of his movies depends on where his angst and his neuroses are at at the time. His films are often autobiographical in nature. We have seen the same themes evolve over the years. This is often fascinating, because we see his views of these subjects change as he grows older.Celebrity is not a major work by Allen. It is if he is in some emotional crossroads and can not pick a suitable path for the story, which makes the movie choppy. Some scenes have flashes of brilliance, while others work for Allen, but not for the audience. The acting is much less subtle than usual, which may be because the celebrity world it is set in is not known for subtlety.Lee Simon [Kenneth Branagh] is a journalist who longs for a better life. He has had a couple of novels published. Critics trashed them both, and now Joe is convinced that the screenplay he is working on is the answer. He decides to dump his wife, Judy [Judy Davis] so that he can pursue his dreams. She falls apart, but, in a classic Allen theme, she regroups and becomes a better, happier person, while Lee continues to flounder.Within the rather slim plot, there are vignettes about various kinds of celebrities, and these are the parts of the movie that often work best. Charlize Theron portrays a supermodel who is the walking definition of shallow. Melanie Griffin is a demented star. Leonardo Di Caprio gives a startling performance as Brandon, a self-centered brat who is America's heartthrob of the moment.As in almost every Allen opus, the main character falls for much younger women. A new twist here is Lee's adventures with Brandon. He is no match for the recklessness, wildness and stamina of a much younger man. True to the older man / younger woman theme, Lee learnes nothing from this encounter.People who are not familiar with the director's work will probably be turned off by Celebrity, if only because it is black and white. Those who do not like Allen will find their distaste reaffirmed. Allen fans will be diverted, but will hope that his next project will prove more on target. There is a good chance that it will be, as the director has always been hit and miss.

Kenneth Branagh stars as Lee Simons, a writer who's looking for support for his script and is interviewing famous stars. While he goes deep down the world of movie stars, supermodels and big celebrities, Lee ends up his marriage with Robin, who at first doesn't take well the breakup but soon gets involved with a charismatic man that changes her life an vision about the future.A sharp comedy that exposes the silly reasons of why people become famous and the even more ridiculous behavior they exhibit, Celebrity is brilliantly acted, flawlessly written and filmed in shiny black and white.Once again, critics and fans of Allen's work won't be able but to find similarities with his life. Lee is a typical Woody, in a marriage crisis, hyperkinetic, black humored, sex-obsessed, and talking constantly about human relationships and his multiple neurosis.The representation of what could be his life becomes in Celebrity in hard criticism, even harder than the one showed in Deconstructing Harry. Is the voice of a tormented man, able to question his life trough his art.The interesting thing about Celebrity is that present us Lee as a confident, arrogant, happy man living the life he always wanted.

Here in celebrity, a profane film about nothing, the nuerosis is what it would be in the hands of any other  film-maker, annoying. Now about the profanity, the characters in this film  throw it out like 10 year olds who have just learned a new set of words and  in desperate need to show off, therefore their delivery is stilted. I  normally love colourfull dialogue, but if you want to see it used  comedically and naturally, check out how Ron Shelton uses it in White Man  Can Jump, or how De Niro and Pesci use it in a Scorscese flick. Allen is  also worringly preoccupied with masterbation and penis jokes which are  fine, but when they take up a third of the running time then something is  wrong. The thing is, all this is a side show as the film is about nothing.  I showed this film to my mother after telling her how great Allen was, and  by the end I was depressed and speechless. With its sitcom level satire of  celebrity, its overlength this has got to be the worst film Allen has ever  made (I love Shadows and Fog no matter what anyone thinks). I don't however  think he has lost it, becuase his best films were made in the late 80s and  early 90s, Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Husbands and  Wives and especially Bullets Over Broadway are all classics.

If you are seeking complete collections of Kenneth Branagh or Judy Davis movies or movies by any number of the actors who appear, walk on or cameo in this movie then you have an excuse to buy Celebrity. If you're looking for an evening's entertainment do not read further, do not get this movie, do not rent this movie. It's just not worth it.Kenneth Branagh is a brilliant actor and more than capable director. One can almost see him eager to be an actor in a movie written and directed by Woody Allen. No doubt some of the other stars were looking for some Woody Allen magic and perhaps a chance to appear in a movie with each other. Speaking as a Woody Allen fan I can't think of any reason to condemn a general viewing audience to a showing of this movie.Somehow we're supposed to believe that Kenneth Branagh playing another one of the neurotic New York stuttering fumbling male comedic characters is a former star high school athlete recently divorced from another neurotic New York female Judy Davis/Annie Hall retread. About one third of this movie consists of these two characters being neurotic and inhibited and recently divorced from each other. The ex-husband Lee Simon is of course incompetent on a heroic scale and we are told is simply unlucky in love. The ex-wife Robin Simon goes almost directly from the marriage bed into the arms of a man who will not only loves her idiosyncrasies but turns them into what we are led to believe will be a successful television career.What saves this movie from a single star rating is that between being aggravated by an otherwise nothing new central plot device is a parade of clever to superior acting performances from people like Melanie Griffith, Winona Ryder, Leonardo DiCaprio and Babe Neuwirth.There is some yammering about a culture that's lost its values and people who are famous for being famous and so on. There is no new ground being broken here. Ultimately we have two caricatures we have seen too many times from Woody Allen. They've lost their charm and here they are quite aggravating.

This film by Allen is shot in black &amp; white, is  pretentious, self-serving and self-indulgent.  There is a story in here  somewhere that seeks to explore the nature and effects of fame, but toward  that end the viewer is subjected to a vast array of unsympathetic  characters, mediocre performances and a lot of endless stammering and hand  wringing.  Kenneth Branagh should be happy with this one, however, because  for him there is no place to go from here but up; this is far and away the  nadir of his film career.  He plays Lee Simon, a writer, a role written by  Allen obviously with himself in mind, and Branagh does little more with it  than give a Woody Allen impersonation throughout the entire movie.  Inexplicably, he fails to create any semblance of an original character, so  caught up apparently with ""doing Woody,"" and the result is a ridiculous  caricature that lacks any credibility and is annoying in the extreme.  How  a terrific actor like Branagh, with so many personal tools at his disposal,  could produce such a pretentious portrait is beyond comprehension.  Judy  Davis comes off looking bad as well; playing essentially the same type of  role as she did in Allen's ""Deconstructing Harry"" (which she pulled off so  well), she has been ""over-Woodied"" in this one, taking her character of  Robin (Lee's wife) to a teeth-clenching extreme.  Watching such a gifted  actress give such a fingernails-scraping-the-blackboard performance is  almost beyond endurance.  Also wasted in this film are the talents of Hank  Azaria, Leonardo DiCaprio, Melanie Griffith, Famke Janssen, and Michael  Lerner.  The only actors who managed to keep their heads above water in  this one were Joe Mantegna (as Tony, the only character you could come  close to caring anything about), Bebe Neuwirth (as a hooker), Winona Ryder  (as an aspiring actress) and Charlize Theron, who was probably the most  memorable, in a convincing turn as a supermodel.

(Just so we don't miss the point, this was shot in black-and-white, but, unlike the older film, the story is now set in -- where else in a contemporary Woody Allen movie? -- Manhattan, rather than Rome.)So far, so good. This should well have been another perfectly good Allen comedy, but, alas, he blows it big time by casting a woefully unsuited actor -- not even a seasoned comic actor -- to star in a role screenwritten for the unique delivery style and appearance of, well, Woody Allen.Allen has said in interviews that he cast Kenneth Branagh in this part because Allen looks too old for it: He needed someone about 40, and Branagh fit the bill.HUGE mistake. Though Branagh is a distinguished dramatic actor and director, he's totally out of his depth playing a younger stand-in for Allen, much as Allen himself would be if he was to play Claudius opposite Branagh as Hamlet.Branagh simply doesn't know how to be funny in here. He speaks all the Woody Allen-type lines, credibly recreates Allen's requisite halting patter, yet utterly fails to capture either Allen's, or any other sort of, comic timing. The result is that he merely sounds foolish and pathetic -- too much so to even care about his character.Allen should've faced facts, bit the bullet, and cast himself in the part. Sure, he's too old, but that could've been easily remedied by changing the story just enough to make that character older. After all, it's not an action movie we're talking here: Make the character 60ish, cast an older actress like Diane Keaton or Dianne Wiest (who're much funnier at playing an Allenesque female counterpart than is the younger Judy Davis anyway) as his ex-wife, cast someone like Judy Davis instead of the glamorous Famke Janssen as Allen's first girlfriend and someone like Madonna or Helen Hunt instead of Winona Ryder as his even more youthful second girlfriend. These modifications would've worked beautifully, making it popular with audiences and critics alike, and made a profit instead of losing the bundle it did.And what a shame: The movie has some wonderful, hilarious set-ups for Allen's brand of humor -- escapades with a seductive supermodel (Charlize Theron), with a madcap movie star (Leonardo DiCaprio), and at a literary cocktail party. The LA DOLCE VITA parallelling provides a nice framework for everything, but without Allen in the flesh, the completed work suffers badly for want of wit, personality and cohesion.",2,Fatally flawed movie despite fine premise,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,2577,"['comedy', 'tribute', 'guise', 'parody', 'great', 'Italian', 'filmmaker', 'Federico', 'Fellini', 'early', ""'60s"", 'classic', 'LA', 'DOLCE', 'VITA', 'Just', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'point', 'was', 'shot', 'black-and-white', 'older', 'film', 'story', 'now', 'set', 'where', 'else', 'contemporary', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'Manhattan', 'rather', 'Rome', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'should', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'perfectly', 'good', 'Allen', 'comedy', 'alas', 'big', 'time', 'casting', 'woefully', 'unsuited', 'actor', 'not', 'even', 'seasoned', 'comic', 'actor', 'star', 'role', 'screenwritten', 'unique', 'delivery', 'style', 'appearance', 'well', 'Woody', 'Allen.Allen', 'said', 'interviews', 'cast', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'part', 'Allen', 'too', 'old', 'needed', 'someone', '40', 'Branagh', 'fit', 'bill.HUGE', 'mistake', 'Branagh', 'distinguished', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'director', 'totally', 'depth', 'playing', 'younger', 'stand-in', 'Allen', 'much', 'Allen', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'play', 'Claudius', 'opposite', 'Branagh', 'Hamlet.Branagh', 'simply', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'be', 'funny', 'here', 'Woody', 'Allen-type', 'lines', 'credibly', 'Allen', 'requisite', 'halting', 'patter', 'yet', 'utterly', 'capture', 'Allen', 'other', 'sort', 'comic', 'timing', 'result', 'merely', 'foolish', 'pathetic', 'too', 'much', 'even', 'care', 'character.Allen', 'should', ""'ve"", 'faced', 'facts', 'bit', 'bullet', 'cast', 'part', 'Sure', 'too', 'old', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'easily', 'remedied', 'changing', 'story', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'character', 'older', 'not', 'action', 'movie', ""'re"", 'talking', 'here', 'Make', 'character', '60ish', 'cast', 'older', 'actress', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'who', ""'re"", 'much', 'funnier', 'playing', 'Allenesque', 'female', 'counterpart', 'younger', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'anyway', 'ex-wife', 'cast', 'someone', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'instead', 'glamorous', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Allen', 'first', 'girlfriend', 'someone', 'Madonna', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'instead', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'even', 'more', 'youthful', 'second', 'girlfriend', 'modifications', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'beautifully', 'making', 'popular', 'audiences', 'critics', 'alike', 'made', 'profit', 'instead', 'losing', 'bundle', 'what', 'shame', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'hilarious', 'set-ups', 'Allen', 'brand', 'humor', 'seductive', 'supermodel', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'madcap', 'movie', 'star', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'literary', 'cocktail', 'party', 'LA', 'DOLCE', 'VITA', 'parallelling', 'nice', 'framework', 'everything', 'Allen', 'flesh', 'completed', 'work', 'suffers', 'badly', 'want', 'wit', 'personality', 'cohesion']",Celebrity VHS

That is the only down fall to  this movie. Branagh goes through this movie in and out of relationships. A  short fling at the beginning with Melanie Griffith, then Charlize Theron,  and on, and on...
