It certainly presented a frank and realistic picture of death and dying. Sally Field, as Anita, was outstanding in the main role...not mawkish or self-pitying, but both angry and resigned by turns as she moves thru the final days of her life.The movie portrays her four adult children whose conflicts do not disappear despite their mother's imminent demise. In fact, their differences probably become more apparent. Accusations fly, old battles are fought, they get angry at others for what they are doing or not doing. This brought back so many memories of my mother's final weeks, when one of my siblings did absolutely nothing to help.The grown daughter, Emily, faces her fears with volumes of self-help books while some of her brothers bury their heads in the sand. This was also typical of my family (I was the one reading the books, BTW).I would only hope that every patient could have the kind of gentle hospice care in her home that Anita had in this movie.Worth viewing, IMO.

1092318,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000TV1ST2,Ed Uyeshima,"[26, 28]","The humor is way too forced, superficial and well-trodden to add the well-intentioned black comedy elements this otherwise bittersweet soap opera needs, but this 2007 film offers a vanity-free Sally Field giving a powerhouse performance as Anita Bergman, the dying mother of four grown children. The movie's title refers to the amount of time her character is expected to live before succumbing to ovarian cancer. With the clock ticking, the four children gather at her North Carolina home from different parts of the country and respond differently to the imminent tragedy. Directed and written by Steve Stockman as a series of vignettes, the characterizations represent different archetypes, and the actors are left to flesh them out to some human dimension. The results of their efforts are variable.Affecting an unrecognizable American accent, Ben Chaplin fares the poorest as eldest brother Keith, an LA-based filmmaker whose sarcastic jokes are meant to shield him from feelings of insecurity and guilt. His character has the most screen time, yet his constantly jokey facade gets in the way of any sympathy we have for him. At first, Tom Cavanaugh plays Ben, the son Anita has dubbed the responsible one, as an obnoxious yuppie workaholic who gradually reveals his fears of loss but fades in the background. As only daughter Beth, Julianne Nicholson is terrific in unconditionally embracing her role as chief caretaker given that her mother is really her best friend, for better or worse. Youngest brother Matthew is drawn in the broadest strokes as the picked-upon baby of the family, and his resentment has manifested itself with a shrewish wife whom everybody else hates.On the sidelines is Anita's second husband of 13 years, Jim, played by James Murtagh, who glowers in resentment as her children take over their house with nary a thought in his direction. Anita's first husband and the father of her children exists as a shadowy figure in the story, and Anita - in one of many revealing videotaped excerpts - has obviously not fully come to terms with her divorce. These clips - showing Anita recorded by Keith in an earlier stage of her cancer - are used as a dramatically effective framing device for the story, and Field shows herself to be at the height of her artistry in these scenes even when the material gets mawkish. Stockman based the story on the death of his own mother in 1997, and this experience informs a lot of the moments in the film, especially the brutalizing scenes of Anita's rapid decline under hospice care.The 2007 DVD is two-sided split between full and widescreen versions and with the extras divvied up. Stockman provides an informative commentary track accompanied periodically by Dr. Ira Byock, a physician specializing in treating those knowingly facing death. There's also a solid 23-minute making-of featurette, ""Learning to Live Through Dying"", and four scenes labeled deleted though truthfully only one is deleted while the other three are extended. There is a group discussion guide included in each version that provides text questions to help the viewer face the death of a loved one.",3,Sally's Field Day as a Dying Mother Surrounded by Shallow Characters and Forced Humor,1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,3136,"['humor', 'way', 'too', 'forced', 'superficial', 'well-trodden', 'add', 'well-intentioned', 'black', 'comedy', 'elements', 'otherwise', 'bittersweet', 'soap', 'opera', 'needs', '2007', 'film', 'vanity-free', 'Sally', 'Field', 'giving', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'Anita', 'Bergman', 'dying', 'mother', 'four', 'grown', 'children', 'movie', 'title', 'refers', 'amount', 'time', 'character', 'expected', 'live', 'succumbing', 'ovarian', 'cancer', 'clock', 'ticking', 'four', 'children', 'gather', 'North', 'Carolina', 'home', 'different', 'parts', 'country', 'respond', 'differently', 'imminent', 'tragedy', 'Directed', 'written', 'Steve', 'Stockman', 'series', 'vignettes', 'characterizations', 'represent', 'different', 'archetypes', 'actors', 'are', 'left', 'flesh', 'out', 'human', 'dimension', 'results', 'efforts', 'are', 'variable.Affecting', 'unrecognizable', 'American', 'accent', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'poorest', 'eldest', 'brother', 'Keith', 'LA-based', 'filmmaker', 'sarcastic', 'jokes', 'are', 'meant', 'shield', 'feelings', 'insecurity', 'guilt', 'character', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'yet', 'constantly', 'jokey', 'facade', 'way', 'sympathy', 'have', 'first', 'Tom', 'Cavanaugh', 'Ben', 'son', 'Anita', 'dubbed', 'responsible', 'one', 'obnoxious', 'yuppie', 'workaholic', 'who', 'gradually', 'fears', 'loss', 'fades', 'background', 'only', 'daughter', 'Beth', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'terrific', 'unconditionally', 'embracing', 'role', 'chief', 'caretaker', 'given', 'mother', 'really', 'best', 'friend', 'better', 'worse', 'Youngest', 'brother', 'Matthew', 'drawn', 'broadest', 'strokes', 'picked-upon', 'baby', 'family', 'resentment', 'manifested', 'shrewish', 'wife', 'whom', 'everybody', 'else', 'sidelines', 'Anita', 'second', 'husband', '13', 'years', 'Jim', 'played', 'James', 'Murtagh', 'who', 'resentment', 'children', 'take', 'over', 'house', 'thought', 'direction', 'Anita', 'first', 'husband', 'father', 'children', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'story', 'Anita', 'one', 'many', 'revealing', 'videotaped', 'excerpts', 'obviously', 'not', 'fully', 'come', 'terms', 'divorce', 'clips', 'showing', 'Anita', 'recorded', 'Keith', 'earlier', 'stage', 'cancer', 'are', 'used', 'dramatically', 'effective', 'framing', 'device', 'story', 'Field', 'be', 'height', 'artistry', 'scenes', 'even', 'when', 'material', 'mawkish', 'Stockman', 'based', 'story', 'death', 'own', 'mother', '1997', 'experience', 'lot', 'moments', 'film', 'especially', 'brutalizing', 'scenes', 'Anita', 'rapid', 'decline', 'hospice', 'care.The', '2007', 'DVD', 'two-sided', 'split', 'full', 'widescreen', 'versions', 'extras', 'divvied', 'up', 'Stockman', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'accompanied', 'periodically', 'Dr.', 'Ira', 'Byock', 'physician', 'specializing', 'treating', 'knowingly', 'facing', 'death', 'also', 'solid', '23-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'Learning', 'Live', 'Dying', 'four', 'scenes', 'labeled', 'deleted', 'truthfully', 'only', 'one', 'deleted', 'other', 'three', 'are', 'extended', 'group', 'discussion', 'guide', 'included', 'version', 'text', 'questions', 'help', 'viewer', 'face', 'death', 'loved', 'one']",Two Weeks

Steve Stockman wrote, directed and produced this little film and his inspiration and efforts are well served by a fine ensemble cast. It is a story about dying and the effects the finality of that event have on a family that has dispersed in different directions life.Anita Bergman (a phenomenally effective Sally Field) is under hospice care as she faces her last days of dying from gastrointestinal cancer.  Knowing that she has little time left she calls upon her four children to return home to North Carolina for goodbyes. Her children are a mixed lot: Keith (Ben Chaplin) is a Zen-influenced California man who has decided to video his mother for posterity; Barry (Thomas Cavanagh) is a workaholic who attempts to piece together time for this inconvenient disruption in his work routine; Matthew (Glenn Howerton) is the baby of the family dominated by a tactless wife whom the rest of the family detest; Emily (a luminous Julianne Nicholson) is the sole sister who has collected all the books on the dying process for her brothers' education and is the stalwart one who holds the family together.  Anita divorced the children's father and remarried a quiet man Jim (James Murtaugh) who is essentially ignored or tolerated by the children.  Anita shares memories, both tender and hilarious, about her life with her family, and as the hospice nurse Carol (Michael Hyatt) tenderly leads the children through  the instructions regarding final care, the four bond again, become more accepting of their disparate directions, share some very funny conversations to relieve the gloom of the event, and interact more than they have since childhood. By the time of the inevitable event come each of the children and their current father have found vulnerabilities and expanded the tokens of love left to them by Anita, now able to carry out Anita's wishes with a modicum of grace and a lot of warmth.Using the last two weeks of life as a platform for coming together provides the film ample opportunity to address many issues - marriage, children, family, religion, and individuality.  The film is balanced by the superb performance of Sally Field on the one end and the wholly realized characterization by Julianne Nicholson on the other end.  In many ways it is the continuity between the lives of these two women that make the story memorable.  There are some fine lessons to be heard in this film, and the telling of the story is very satisfying to watch.

We've all been there before - dysfunctional family gathers at the bedside of a dying (choose 1: grandparent, parent, sibling, child). The actos do well with their roles, but can barely rise above the stereotypes. The poignancy in the film comes from the situation itself, not from any skill in the writing. Each scene follows a predictable inevitability (even the scattering of the ashes at the end), and the humor is forced and unnatural, with two completely superfluous scenes (a son trying to retrieve his bag at the airport; another son trying to get the store discount for orange juice at a grocery) added as intended humorous interludes to break up the sadness of the main story line.

1092327,A215UFP1S3G2OI,B000TV1ST2,K. Richards,"[1, 1]","I gave a title for my review ""Not for the critics"". Why? Because when watching a movie, everyone is a critic. But the critique is usually about whether a movie is entertaining enough, colorful enough, whether the acting is good enough...and this...is not that kind of film. I am no poet or eloquent speaker. Very simply put, this movie is about death and dying. We start young not thinking about what death will be like for us some day, specially if we are going long before we are ready to, but this is also about those left behind. In this case, grown children. This little movie is listed as comedy and drama, but it's drama with comic relief. One reviewer said that the comedy was forced, but what the reviewer didn't take into consideration is that, in real life this is exactly how it would happen. Most people aren't comfortable with death and most of us, when losing a loved one, have a difficult time coming to terms. I love the instruction about the stages of death, it's a very thoughtful way of educating those specially in hospice. This movie is tactful, and other times thoughtless in the characters interactions with each other, but again, it's what makes it so realistic.I am a fan of quirky romantic comedies. But more often than not can recognize a gem. A movie with a, what some might call sappy story line, that has the ability to create growth in a person. In this case, me. Sally Field, can play any role and do it well. But I'll tell you, I didn't judge acting, who was in it, or whether the cinematography was good enough. I watched it as if watching friends going through the stages of death. It made me tear up in a few places where I could see myself both as the mother and the grown children. No matter how complex this family was, the end result was human and the message loud and clear, everyone deals with death differently. This movie is very well worth watching and I'll even go as far as calling it beautiful, which seems an odd description about a woman dying of cancer.

In many ways, they contain the most powerful words in our language. Help us to forgive, appreciate, love, and celebrate one another more fully. These words are the essence of this film 'Two Weeks"". Sally Field is extraordinary in this film as the mother who is dying of ovarian cancer. Her four children all come home to stand vigil. None of them really know what they are in for.  Ben Chaplin plays the older son from California. A recovering alcoholic, drug addict, we are not privy to much inside info, he is into Zen and withholding his emotions.  Sister, Julianne Nicholson, leads the troops with knowledge from books and the love she has for her mother. Tim Cavanaugh plays the middle child, the most reliable and the least ready to face the death of his mother. The youngest child, Glenn Howerton, is he ever really there, has the most obnoxious wife. Here they are watching their mom, vomit daily and vomiting stool, cleaning the body and cleaning the bed. After a while the daily ritual becomes a routine manner.  Mom, Sally Fields has taped her last words. Some are trite and some are true, are they necessary?  Mom seems to be prepared and the best that she has is her family and a Hospice Nurse, who knows exactly what to do.  Pain medication, care and love and advice are what the Hospice group to best.  They are necessary and wouldn't it be swell if every dying person had the benefit of Hospice.The writer/director, Steve Stockman, has written a film after his own experience. His mother died several years ago and his experiences are explored fully. Fully developed characters are what is missing from this film . We know they are the children but not who and what they are. Little snippets come through at times, but who are these people we are to care about.This is a lovely film about dying, but we need to know more.

1092331,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B000TV1ST2,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[5, 9]","If writer/producer/director Steve Stockman's ambivalent little dramedy ""Two Weeks"" proves anything, it's that a first-rate actor in a lead role can make the difference between bargain bin pap and a prime rental candidate.Yes, the driving force behind his flimsy script can be summed effectively in two words: Sally Field. That's right - the same woman censored during last month's Emmy telecast for her criticism of the Iraq war and/or taking the Lord's name in vein while making her acceptance speech. Lest such a controversy cause us to forget the actress behind the two Oscar and three Emmy wins, however, ""Two Weeks"" gives Field more than ample room to display her impeccable range and cut right to the heart of what makes her a talent for the ages.It's easy to see why Field signed on to play Anita Bergman, a woman seeing her end prematurely in sight due to ovarian cancer. As the film depicts Bergman at many stages of her disease, it presents many acting challenges that Field sails through with flying colors. From the perspective of her children, however, the story falters.Keith (Ben Chaplin, sans the British accent), is a tightly-wound filmmaker who covers up his surge of emotions through a straight-faced, dutiful attitude peppered with quasi-witty banter and purported ""Zen""-like ideals. He is not unlike his workaholic brother Barry (Thomas Cavanaugh), who can barely be whisked away from his palm pilot long enough to bid his mother goodbye. Emily (Julianne Nicholson), meanwhile, plays the more sensible, emotionally forthright of the siblings with an armload of self-help books in tow, while Matthew (Glenn Howerton) is between a rock and a hard place as his wife Katrina (Clea Duvall) has issues with his family and vice/versa.What bogs down the film is that Emily and Matthew are the only two siblings for whom any real sympathy can be mustered, and even the two of them fail to sustain any lasting viewer intrigue. Sure, Field may cast an imposing shadow, but Stockman really fumbles the ball in his character construction of the foursome, leaving the talented actors little to work with. He deserves credit for never taking the easy way out - not even a smidgen of trumped up pathos is to be found here - but the dialogue between the siblings too often smacks of effort, especially early on. Charismatic deadpan comes left and right, but the jokes can be seen from a mile away and feel consistently forced and, most importantly, jarring considering their context. Scenes intended to be comical that occur in an airport and supermarket also yield a sour aftertaste.There are some fine moments, however. Actor James Murtaugh radiates a poignant blend of strength and vulnerability through his character of Jim Cranston, the siblings' forsaken stepfather, when he finally demands the effects of his wife's demise on him be acknowledged as well. Furthermore, actress Jenny O'Hara, best known for playing Doug Heffernan's bumbling mother on the CBS sitcom ""The King of Queens,"" will surprise many in her heartbreaking scene as Anita's lifelong friend Julia when she cannot bring herself to say goodbye.Stockman does succeed in driving home the point that bidding a loved one farewell is a gradual process with many layers and quirks. Because of this, ""Two Weeks"" has obvious therapeutic qualities. Still, there is no denying that despite the talents of his actors he should have given his script a re-write with more attention devoted to feasible characterization and substantial humor.",2,Two Weeks Too Long (2.5 Stars),1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,3505,"['writer/producer/director', 'Steve', 'Stockman', 'ambivalent', 'little', 'dramedy', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'anything', 'first-rate', 'actor', 'lead', 'role', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'bargain', 'bin', 'pap', 'prime', 'rental', 'candidate.Yes', 'driving', 'force', 'flimsy', 'script', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'effectively', 'two', 'words', 'Sally', 'Field', 'right', 'same', 'woman', 'censored', 'last', 'month', 'Emmy', 'telecast', 'criticism', 'Iraq', 'war', 'and/or', 'taking', 'Lord', 'name', 'vein', 'making', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'Lest', 'controversy', 'cause', 'forget', 'actress', 'two', 'Oscar', 'three', 'Emmy', 'wins', 'however', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Field', 'more', 'ample', 'room', 'display', 'impeccable', 'range', 'cut', 'right', 'heart', 'what', 'talent', 'ages.It', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Field', 'signed', 'play', 'Anita', 'Bergman', 'woman', 'seeing', 'end', 'prematurely', 'sight', 'due', 'ovarian', 'cancer', 'film', 'Bergman', 'many', 'stages', 'disease', 'many', 'acting', 'challenges', 'Field', 'sails', 'flying', 'colors', 'perspective', 'children', 'however', 'story', 'falters.Keith', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'British', 'accent', 'tightly-wound', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'up', 'surge', 'emotions', 'straight-faced', 'dutiful', 'attitude', 'peppered', 'quasi-witty', 'banter', 'purported', 'Zen', '-like', 'ideals', 'not', 'workaholic', 'brother', 'Barry', 'Thomas', 'Cavanaugh', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'be', 'whisked', 'away', 'palm', 'pilot', 'long', 'enough', 'bid', 'mother', 'goodbye', 'Emily', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'meanwhile', 'more', 'sensible', 'emotionally', 'forthright', 'siblings', 'armload', 'self-help', 'books', 'tow', 'Matthew', 'Glenn', 'Howerton', 'rock', 'hard', 'place', 'wife', 'Katrina', 'Clea', 'Duvall', 'issues', 'family', 'bogs', 'down', 'film', 'Emily', 'Matthew', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'siblings', 'whom', 'real', 'sympathy', 'can', 'be', 'mustered', 'even', 'two', 'fail', 'sustain', 'lasting', 'viewer', 'intrigue', 'Sure', 'Field', 'may', 'cast', 'imposing', 'shadow', 'Stockman', 'really', 'ball', 'character', 'construction', 'foursome', 'leaving', 'talented', 'actors', 'little', 'work', 'credit', 'never', 'taking', 'easy', 'way', 'not', 'even', 'smidgen', 'trumped', 'up', 'pathos', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'dialogue', 'siblings', 'too', 'often', 'smacks', 'effort', 'especially', 'early', 'Charismatic', 'deadpan', 'left', 'right', 'jokes', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'mile', 'away', 'feel', 'consistently', 'forced', 'most', 'importantly', 'jarring', 'considering', 'context', 'Scenes', 'intended', 'be', 'comical', 'occur', 'airport', 'supermarket', 'also', 'yield', 'sour', 'aftertaste.There', 'are', 'fine', 'moments', 'however', 'Actor', 'James', 'Murtaugh', 'poignant', 'blend', 'strength', 'vulnerability', 'character', 'Jim', 'Cranston', 'siblings', 'forsaken', 'stepfather', 'when', 'finally', 'effects', 'wife', 'demise', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'as', 'well', 'Furthermore', 'actress', 'Jenny', ""O'Hara"", 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'Doug', 'Heffernan', 'bumbling', 'mother', 'CBS', 'sitcom', 'King', 'Queens', 'will', 'surprise', 'many', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'Anita', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'Julia', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'say', 'goodbye.Stockman', 'succeed', 'driving', 'home', 'point', 'bidding', 'loved', 'one', 'farewell', 'gradual', 'process', 'many', 'layers', 'quirks', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'obvious', 'therapeutic', 'qualities', 'Still', 'denying', 'talents', 'actors', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'script', 're-write', 'more', 'attention', 'devoted', 'feasible', 'characterization', 'substantial', 'humor']",Two Weeks

1092333,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000TV1ST2,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[18, 19]","This genre tends to be hit or miss in that it's very hard to create a credible drama with humorous elements.  This one nails it quite well.Recent endeavors into this genre have left me feeling very suspicious of them and the disastrousRunning With Scissorspretty much nailed the coffin shut for me.  Earlier tries that I can recall that were quite good wereTerms of EndearmentandSteel Magnolias.  This film, Two Weeks, like the two previous mentioned films, deals with family relations and death and to my surprise handled both with great insight and realism that is laced with gallows-like humor.The story about a dying mother, excellently portrayed by the ever reliable and incredibly youthful Sally Field, who is predominately cared for by her daughter, extremely well-played by Julianne Nicholson.  The sons are invited later, during the mother's final stage of death, to come and help and pay their respects.  Old jealousies, arguments, and petty issues come up more because of the tension of dealing with a dying parent than anything else, but they are all realistically handled except for the youngest brother who simply can't see the self-absorbed wife he has that grates on everyone's nerves.  It's a stretch to see anything likable in her enough to encourage anyone to want to marry her.  Of course, this marriage alone could simply be a rebellious act by the younger brother who feels ignored (hence the marriage to a wife that demands everyone's attention 24/7).The two older brothers are well-played by Ben Chaplin, the oldest child, and Tom Cavanagh, the business obsessed child.  I totally disagree with the director's comments noted on this product page wherein he notes that this British actor's American accent is perfect and no one can tell he's not American.  Is he kidding?  Did he watch his own film?  Chaplin gives a terrific performance, but there is no doubt he's British.  I kept waiting for the explanation in the film for this.  Was he perhaps raised in Britain by his father who divorced his mother when they were young?  Alas, the director chose to believe he sounds American.  Cavanagh, TV's ""Ed"" and arthouse thrillerSublime, is nicely convincing in his role.  I wish he he had both more on screen time and more roles as he is a compelling and believable actor in everything I've seen him in and he's been diverse roles since exiting his TV series.An interesting aspect of this film is both the hospice care the dying mother and family receive and the ever constant instruction/explanation the daughter gives from her vast collection of books on dealing with the dying.  It is rather educational, especially for those who have not traveled down this road before.  I have experienced quite a lot of this this year when my dad passed away.  Of course, I can also relate to all the family squabbling as well that went on at my dad's passing.  Everyone's feelings are rather raw and even exaggerated during the death of a parent.  Every little dispute and off-handed comment is blown way out of portion and everyone is seeking his or her own special validation for the pain he or she is experiencing.  This film captures all of that fairly and honestly.Although this film is highly predictable, it is very watchable and enjoyable.  We understand the pain this family is experiencing, the end of life views of a dying mother, and the always unsettled disputes that arise in any family, especially larger ones.  If you have ever been through a death of a parent, you will see yourself and others in this film.  If you have not experienced the death of a parent yet, then you are fortunate in two ways: you still have time to reconcile with your parent(s) and see how death is both uniting and divisive.  You have time to prepare for the inevitable.  This is an insightful film that strikes a good balance between the drama and comedy that is within all of our lives at the time of a loved one's death.",4,A suprisingly good balance of comedy and drama.,1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,3927,"['genre', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', 'very', 'hard', 'create', 'credible', 'drama', 'humorous', 'elements', 'one', 'quite', 'well.Recent', 'endeavors', 'genre', 'have', 'left', 'feeling', 'very', 'suspicious', 'disastrousRunning', 'Scissorspretty', 'much', 'nailed', 'coffin', 'shut', 'Earlier', 'tries', 'can', 'recall', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'wereTerms', 'EndearmentandSteel', 'Magnolias', 'film', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'two', 'previous', 'mentioned', 'films', 'deals', 'family', 'relations', 'death', 'surprise', 'handled', 'great', 'insight', 'realism', 'laced', 'gallows-like', 'humor.The', 'story', 'dying', 'mother', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'ever', 'reliable', 'incredibly', 'youthful', 'Sally', 'Field', 'who', 'predominately', 'cared', 'daughter', 'extremely', 'well-played', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'sons', 'are', 'invited', 'later', 'mother', 'final', 'stage', 'death', 'come', 'help', 'pay', 'respects', 'Old', 'jealousies', 'arguments', 'petty', 'issues', 'come', 'up', 'more', 'tension', 'dealing', 'dying', 'parent', 'anything', 'else', 'are', 'realistically', 'handled', 'youngest', 'brother', 'who', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'self-absorbed', 'wife', 'everyone', 'nerves', 'stretch', 'see', 'anything', 'likable', 'enough', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'want', 'marry', 'course', 'marriage', 'alone', 'could', 'simply', 'be', 'rebellious', 'act', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'ignored', 'hence', 'marriage', 'wife', 'everyone', 'attention', '24/7', '.The', 'two', 'older', 'brothers', 'are', 'well-played', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'oldest', 'child', 'Tom', 'Cavanagh', 'business', 'obsessed', 'child', 'totally', 'disagree', 'director', 'comments', 'noted', 'product', 'page', 'wherein', 'British', 'actor', 'American', 'accent', 'perfect', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'not', 'American', 'kidding', 'Did', 'watch', 'own', 'film', 'Chaplin', 'terrific', 'performance', 'doubt', 'British', 'kept', 'waiting', 'explanation', 'film', 'perhaps', 'raised', 'Britain', 'father', 'who', 'divorced', 'mother', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'Alas', 'director', 'chose', 'believe', 'American', 'Cavanagh', 'TV', 'Ed', 'arthouse', 'thrillerSublime', 'nicely', 'convincing', 'role', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'more', 'roles', 'compelling', 'believable', 'actor', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'been', 'diverse', 'roles', 'exiting', 'TV', 'series.An', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'hospice', 'care', 'dying', 'mother', 'family', 'receive', 'ever', 'constant', 'instruction/explanation', 'daughter', 'vast', 'collection', 'books', 'dealing', 'dying', 'rather', 'educational', 'especially', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'traveled', 'down', 'road', 'have', 'experienced', 'quite', 'lot', 'year', 'when', 'dad', 'passed', 'away', 'course', 'can', 'also', 'relate', 'family', 'squabbling', 'as', 'well', 'went', 'dad', 'passing', 'Everyone', 'feelings', 'are', 'rather', 'raw', 'even', 'exaggerated', 'death', 'parent', 'little', 'dispute', 'off-handed', 'comment', 'blown', 'way', 'portion', 'everyone', 'seeking', 'own', 'special', 'validation', 'pain', 'experiencing', 'film', 'fairly', 'honestly.Although', 'film', 'highly', 'predictable', 'very', 'watchable', 'enjoyable', 'understand', 'pain', 'family', 'experiencing', 'end', 'life', 'views', 'dying', 'mother', 'always', 'unsettled', 'disputes', 'arise', 'family', 'especially', 'larger', 'ones', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'death', 'parent', 'will', 'see', 'others', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'experienced', 'death', 'parent', 'yet', 'then', 'are', 'fortunate', 'two', 'ways', 'still', 'have', 'time', 'reconcile', 'parent', 's', 'see', 'how', 'death', 'uniting', 'divisive', 'have', 'time', 'prepare', 'inevitable', 'insightful', 'film', 'good', 'balance', 'drama', 'comedy', 'lives', 'time', 'loved', 'one', 'death']",Two Weeks
