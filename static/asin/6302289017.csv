306037,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,6302289017,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[2, 2]","Frankie and Johnny starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino is a sweet, emotional, and honest film about trust, finding and accepting love. Pfeiffer is perfectly cast as a lonely and introverted Frankie, she is a waitress and against her wishes she falls for an ex-jail bird named Johnny, who is now a short-order cook where she works. Frankie is afraid of being in a real relationship due to past events, but slowly and surely, Johnny tries to heal her from previous wounds.  Their chemistry is spot-on and Garry Marshall always directs the perfect movie. I love, love, love this bittersweet comedy/drama. I highly recommend checking this under-rated gem out.

306038,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302289017,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","My wife saw this movie years ago, and absolutely hated it.  She found it boring and sleep inducing and so when I decided to rent it she was highly apposed.  In the end, I wound up watching this all by my lonesome and I must say that I am on the fence at the moment.I love so much and then again, there is this unsavory taste on my tongue.The film is based on a stage play and basically follows an ex-convict named Johnny, who is trying to establish roots as a fry-cook and woo the reclusive and somewhat abrasive waitress, Frankie.  They both notice each other, and there is definite chemistry, but she is playing hard to get, hiding a past that is obviously making a true connection difficult for her, and he is pushing the issue very hard, getting too close for comfort.I'll start with the things I loved.Michelle Pfeiffer.  I mean, seriously; she's outstanding here.  She completely sinks into this role and delivers one of her finest performances of her career.  From a technical aspect, she's spot on.  The accent, the body language, the delivery; all of it is beautifully astute...but in the end it is the heart with which she embodies this woman that stands out the brightest.  When she finally confides in Johnny, it's enough to break your heart.  Al Pacino is also VERY good here.  I was expecting his usual antics, but then I remembered that this was early 90's, back before he decided to just regurgitate stereotypes as actual performances.  He does one `Hoo-Ha', but once he has that out of the way he shoots straight and delivers a beautifully composed and heartfelt performance.I'm on the fence about the script.  In parts I love it.  The dialog between Frankie and Johnny is smart and natural.  You can tell it was adapted from a stage play because a lot of the interaction between the two leads is dialog heavy and relies on our acceptance of their conversations to really work, but the leads handle the words wonderfully and they are really engaged and poignant conversations.  But then there is the development of supporting characters that is rather underwhelming.  But, maybe that is the fact that I found the supporting cast, outside of Kate Nelligan, to be atrocious.Yes, Hector Elizondo seriously followed up his beautiful `Pretty Woman' performance with this bland as dirt stereotype.  Faring worst of all is Nathan Lane, who fails to deliver any of his lines.  He just isn't funny, at all, and he is supposed to be major comic relief here.  It's sad when you can tell that someone is supposed to serve a certain purpose.  It's too obvious.  Lane is just horrible here.  Jane Morris is also just bad.  But then again, I certainly blame the script on that one.Oh, and the closing `wrap up' with an overview of the characters in bed was just dumb.In the end, there is more than enough to validate seeing this.  Pfeiffer is one of the best of the year, and if it weren't for the iconic duo of Sarandon and Davis coming out in 1991, I'd be forced to name her the absolute best.  It is soft and sweet yet laced with an acidic bite.  It's just drug down by some poor acting and clich&eacute;d character development.",3,I love me some Frankie and Johnny; it's just everyone else I don't like...,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,3133,"['wife', 'saw', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'found', 'boring', 'sleep', 'inducing', 'so', 'when', 'decided', 'rent', 'was', 'highly', 'apposed', 'end', 'wound', 'up', 'watching', 'all', 'lonesome', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'fence', 'moment.I', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'then', 'again', 'unsavory', 'taste', 'tongue.The', 'film', 'based', 'stage', 'play', 'basically', 'ex-convict', 'named', 'Johnny', 'who', 'trying', 'establish', 'roots', 'fry-cook', 'woo', 'reclusive', 'somewhat', 'abrasive', 'waitress', 'Frankie', 'notice', 'other', 'definite', 'chemistry', 'playing', 'hard', 'get', 'hiding', 'past', 'obviously', 'making', 'true', 'connection', 'difficult', 'pushing', 'issue', 'very', 'hard', 'getting', 'too', 'close', 'comfort.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'things', 'loved.Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'mean', 'seriously', 'outstanding', 'here', 'completely', 'sinks', 'role', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'career', 'technical', 'aspect', 'spot', 'accent', 'body', 'language', 'delivery', 'beautifully', 'astute', 'end', 'heart', 'woman', 'out', 'brightest', 'When', 'finally', 'Johnny', 'enough', 'break', 'heart', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'also', 'VERY', 'good', 'here', 'was', 'expecting', 'usual', 'antics', 'then', 'remembered', 'was', 'early', '90', 'back', 'decided', 'just', 'regurgitate', 'stereotypes', 'actual', 'performances', 'one', 'Hoo-Ha', 'once', 'way', 'shoots', 'straight', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'heartfelt', 'performance.I', ""'m"", 'fence', 'script', 'parts', 'love', 'dialog', 'Frankie', 'Johnny', 'smart', 'natural', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'lot', 'interaction', 'two', 'leads', 'dialog', 'heavy', 'relies', 'acceptance', 'conversations', 'really', 'work', 'leads', 'handle', 'words', 'wonderfully', 'are', 'really', 'engaged', 'poignant', 'conversations', 'then', 'development', 'supporting', 'characters', 'rather', 'underwhelming', 'maybe', 'fact', 'found', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'be', 'atrocious.Yes', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'seriously', 'followed', 'up', 'beautiful', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'performance', 'bland', 'dirt', 'stereotype', 'Faring', 'worst', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'who', 'deliver', 'lines', 'just', ""n't"", 'funny', 'supposed', 'be', 'major', 'comic', 'relief', 'here', 'sad', 'when', 'can', 'tell', 'someone', 'supposed', 'serve', 'certain', 'purpose', 'too', 'obvious', 'Lane', 'just', 'horrible', 'here', 'Jane', 'Morris', 'also', 'just', 'bad', 'then', 'again', 'certainly', 'blame', 'script', 'one.Oh', 'closing', 'wrap', 'up', 'overview', 'characters', 'bed', 'was', 'just', 'dumb.In', 'end', 'more', 'enough', 'validate', 'seeing', 'Pfeiffer', 'one', 'best', 'year', 'were', ""n't"", 'iconic', 'duo', 'Sarandon', 'Davis', 'coming', 'out', '1991', ""'d"", 'be', 'forced', 'name', 'absolute', 'best', 'soft', 'sweet', 'yet', 'laced', 'acidic', 'bite', 'just', 'drug', 'down', 'poor', 'acting', 'clich', 'eacute', 'character', 'development']",Frankie & Johnny VHS

306041,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,6302289017,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[12, 20]","1991's Frankie and Johnny is not a sugary sweet formula romantic comedy. Unfortunately it is not a particularly realistic or believable slice of life romantic drama either.  How could it be with stars like Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer directed by Garry Marshall?Many will like the film quite a bit because there are some scenes that work and the stars are either much better than you expect (Pfeiffer) or simply exude the charm and charisma you want from them (Pacino).  The supporting characters seem to be from another film or t.v. sit-com and all of it is 100 percent predictable, but the film is not difficult at all to sit through.Part of the blame is director Garry Marshall who worked so long in television (Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley) he probably really believes he could pull this off as a feature film.  He doesn't let the film become overly up beat and sickeningly sweet, but he refuses to ever put any real doubt in our minds that it won't have a happy ending either.  Marshall just can't helpdousing everything with an un-real fairy dust...like in 'A Pretty Woman' or the recent 'Princess Diaries'.  Those were supposed to be fantasy films however,Frankie and Johnny was originally something grittier and more realistic. It was originally a harder edged two-character stage play that starred Kathy Bates and F. Murray Abraham.Al Pacino plays Johnny who's actually a really decent and nice guy even though he's just gotten out of prison.  Johnny gets a job as a short cook at the same diner where Frankie works. Frankie refuses to open up, Johnny needs to love and be loved by someone desperately.  Johnny decides that Frankie is the one he needs and it's destiny that has put them together like this.  Johnny's infatuation with Frankie doesn't seem like a stretch at all....I mean she almost looks like Michelle Pfeiffer.  Johnny comes across somewhat like a scary stalker as much as an obsessed lover.  So despite everyone's best effort the entire film feels like a corny Hollywood romance. The film however is written to be the opposite of a cornball Hollywood romance. I hate to say that the biggest fault of the movie is the fact that Pfeiffer is too damned good looking to play the part... but it's the truth. I hate to say that because Pfeiffer is actually better in the film then Pacino is.  Pacino falls back several times on the type of please the crowd surliness and schtick that the film is trying to convince us it's above.  Pfeiffer on the other hand buries herself in playing her character so completely she almost makes us believe she has got to be a rather plain looking woman.The DVD present the film very nicely but gives you no extras.3 and a half stars.Christopher Jarmick, is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

It's hard not to believe that the director just took over a Greek greasy spoon in New York and used its employees. You can literally smell the grease as the short-order cooks scramble the eggs and bacon. And you can feel the loneliness in the pit of your stomach as these characters go home to their less-than-fine apartments. They are the people Barbara Ehrenreich writes about in NICKEL AND DIMED. Robert Frost would say they have nothing to look backward to with pride and nothing to look forward to with hope. Paul McCartney would call them Eleanor Rigby. Many of them will never rise about their minimum wage-plus tips jobs; yet they show a resilence and endurance and manage to find laughter in their dismal jobs that is heart-warming.This film has as good a portrayal of gay characters as you are likely to see. Terrence McNally has created here two, believable, likeable gay men who act like real people. There is a quite funny scene when Al Pacino meets the gay couple for the first time and makes all the usual mistakes though well-intentioned-- he didn't realize, you would never know, he just found out that his cousin is gay-- to which Nathan Lane quips that he will check the cousin out in the new listings.This movie says that a short-order cook (Al Pacino) recently released from prison can find happiness with a waitress (Michelle Pfeiffer) with broken dreams. That may be a tall challenge, but most of us would like to believe in that possibility. It's all about starting over, taking a chance, tearing down the walls that separate most of us from each other and taking a chance on love.Michelle Pfeiffer cleans up well and is almost too pretty to be a down-and-out waitress.

Someone with Michelle Pfeiffer's looks working in a greasy, Westside diner? Yeah, right! In my thirteen years in New York City, I've never seen it. A woman like that would have doctors, lawyers, CEOs, and investment bankers falling all over her.

His reply: ""We just get the ball to Waymon and get the hell out of his way.""  In this movie -- expanded from a two-actor stage play by Terence McNally -- when Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer have the ball, all goes relatively well, but in the expansion for the big screen, McNally has added a lot of extra clutter.  The additional characters are mostly lovable eccentric New York stereotypes, and not even the talents of Nathan Lane, Hector Elizondo, Kate Nelligan, and the others can make them more than one-dimensional.  Still, they're lively, and the scenes in the restaurant in the busy times have a kind of energy and color that's appealing.  More important, perhaps, these scenes let us see Frankie and Johnny interacting with others, with the result that Johnny doesn't seem as creepy as he otherwise might (an unsympathetic woman might consider him a stalker), and Frankie shows that she isn't all about depression and neediness.Pacino and Pfeiffer are very appealing, which is good, because their characters aren't all that interesting. Johnny was jailed for forging a signature on a check and spent 18 months in the slammer, which is where he developed his cooking skills.  He has come out desperate for connection and real affection.  Frankie can't, as they say, ""commit,"" and it takes most of the movie's almost two hours for us to find out why that is.  The sexual chemistry between them is not a problem, and part of the movie's agenda is to make sure that we see the difference between that chemistry and a love that is protective and nurturing.  The movie succeeds as well as it does because Pacino convinces the audience, as well as Frankie, that that is what he has to offer, and because Pfeiffer is believable as a wounded woman (even before we know what the wounds are) and not just a wet blanket.

It's a superior romantic-comedy-drama which stars screen legend Al Pacino and screen goddess Michelle Pfeiffer. The movie is so much more about the love story. It is a very perceptive movie about people who are lonely and people who are trapped into their own lives. The movie has an achingly melancholic mood.The casting of Michelle Pfeiffer was controversial at that time because the original role on Broadway was played by Kathy Bates and a lot of people think Pfeiffer was too beautiful for the role. Bates reportedly laughed when she learned hat Pfeiffer got the role. Granted that the reason Pfeifer probably got the role was because at that time she was at the height of her popularity, she was the ""it"" girl then. But Pfeiffer was phenomenal and proved that she deserved the part. Her beauty was toned down to make her look as ordinary as possible. The character she played has so much depth and layer that is pretty uncommon for films generally regarded as romance films.Pacino of course was good, this is his and Pfeiffer's second team up after Scarface of course I love the fact that he played the role with such ease and charm which is a lot different from his more serious roles before. The supporting actors Nathan Lane and Kate Nelligan stole some scenesOf all the movies of Pfeiffer this is one of my all time favorites together with Fabulous Baker Boys, Married to the Mob, One Fine Day, and Batman Returns to name a few.
