However, I am somewhat disappointed in the fact that this series looks a little ""grainy"" as compared to the others and I played them in my HD DVD player which upconverts the disc. Don't get me wrong, with playing them in a HD player the quality gets better, but the ""grain"" is still vey noticeable. Maybe I'm a little spoiled by HD and Blu ray to the fact that ""regular"" DVD does not look good anymore. Anyway, I am wondering if anyone else out there has noticed the same thing. Also why are these series NOT in DD 5.1? this Dolby ""stereo"" does not get the job done! all in all I love all 5 disc set that I have.I'm still wondering why this show didn't last past 5 seasons?",5,Food for the Soul,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,752,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'LOVE', 'SOUL', 'FOOD', 'have', 'shows', 'DVD', 'However', 'am', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'series', 'little', 'grainy', 'compared', 'others', 'played', 'HD', 'DVD', 'player', 'disc', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'playing', 'HD', 'player', 'quality', 'better', 'grain', 'still', 'vey', 'noticeable', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'little', 'spoiled', 'HD', 'Blu', 'ray', 'fact', 'regular', 'DVD', 'not', 'look', 'good', 'anymore', 'Anyway', 'am', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'else', 'there', 'noticed', 'same', 'thing', 'Also', 'why', 'are', 'series', 'NOT', 'DD', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'stereo', 'not', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'love', '5', 'disc', 'set', 'have.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'why', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'past', '5', 'seasons']",Soul Food - The Series: The Final Season
