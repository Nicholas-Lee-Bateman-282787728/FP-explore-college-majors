Quite a few people seem to have missed the point that it's a film about how people react during a crisis. There really are no cinematic heroes present (a refreshing change from the cliched filled majority of these movies) and the overall situation is given the right sense of dread. These people are alone, trapped in a basement and forced to deal with one another. The fact that some have been driven insane by what happened adds to the tension.

I can understand the wide love it or hate it reviews after watching this movie. The reasons for loving it and hating it varied widely as well so I suppose I'll focus on why I loved it.The movie begins at the end. The nuclear bomb goes off and the lucky few who made it to the basement of an apartment building were saved. The movie is not about why the bomb went off or what happens next but more about the degradation of the human mind when a group is placed in a small space with no hope and limited supplies. They have just enough supplies to last weeks but they lose their minds faster than they run out of food.I was impressed by the acting and have to say, the movie was brutal, depressing and truly disturbing but that is what makes the movie so good. The actors made you believe they were truly out of their minds because the effect happened slowly throughout the movie. The movie was really long so you can really believe in the changes but it might turn some people off because their is only so much depravity and hopelessness one can take. Oh, And to the make up department? You guys deserve an Emmy for the transformations of these characters. This great aspect only matched by the convincing performances.I did not enjoy watching this movie. That is why it is a complete success. It showed how humans can reach desperate lows and I have to move in the love it camp.******SPOILER************Only one minor complaint. I actually enjoyed the ending as it showed the main character getting out of ""cage"" of hell to get out into the open of another hell full of ashes.

He has total control over supplies/food,  or thinks he does..,until the people hauled up in the bunker get sick of him and turn on him- But he's not the only whacko in that bunker or is nothing compared to the other guys.Trapped down there with nowhere to go and some terrorists trying to break into the bunker some of them end up turning on eachother and going crazy.So we know there are terrorists of some kind or someone who wants to go to war with the United states or nuke them but we don't know who exactly- ( though they give vague clues), you can kind of figure it out but you don't know why or what their motive is- even at the end. They wear white hazmat suits or some type of gear and 'experiment' on people and they also want the americans dead- we don't get too find out much more than that. The film is more about the interaction and struggles between the characters trapped in the bunker.Left a lot out but was still pretty entertaining. It kinda gives clues as to exactly what's happening but leaves certain parts to the imagination. I liked it but I didn't like certain parts of it. Kind of extreme.

1526546,A3W3LP0RSWLJCS,B007549W62,Annihilatrix1138,"[3, 8]","You come into a movie like THE DIVIDE with certain expectations, and I think the filmmakers knew what those expectations were and intentionally set out to smash them in the worst way possible. The film begins just as the world starts to come to an end. Missiles rain down from the sky, forcing a random assortment of apartment tenants down into a bomb shelter constructed by the building's shell-shocked superintendent. We aren't told whose nukes are destroying everything; indeed, outside of the initial volley, information concerning what's going on outside the bomb shelter is severely limited. The handful of survivors have only themselves, an endless string of maddening speculations, and the threat of a slow death on the other side of the hatch.The people we find in the shelter are not exactly who you'd expect, and that's pretty much the point. They have a decent supply of food and water, but absolutely no news from the outside, and no real timetable for when they can leave the shelter without the threat of radiation. Time passes slowly for the survivors, who start tallying weeks and months without seeing the sun. The paranoia and general discontent over their situation builds to several breaking points, changing the group dynamic over and over and over.You can toss a handful of people into a shelter, give them food and water and all the things they need to survive, but on a long enough timeline, that won't be enough. You can save people from an apocalypse, but you can't make them get along.As THE DIVIDE progresses, the survivors' situation gets worse and worse; exacerbated by fear, greed, and hormonal urges. We quickly discover that, no, these survivors are definitely not saints. If you were rooting for them in the beginning, there's a definite chance that you won't be at the end. There is no real catharsis here, or even a sliver of hope left over for the viewer to cling to. Things are just pretty dang depressing all around!I gave this movie three stars because while I don't believe this is a bad movie, it's definitely not one that invites multiple viewings. THE DIVIDE is working off the same premise that HEART OF DARKNESS and other works have played off of: that in the absence of civilization, humanity breaks down. In this film, it breaks down in the worst possible way, to the point where it's almost not very believable at times. This is a very graphic movie, and one that I don't believe gives humanity enough credit. But, I mean, as you can see, it also plays with themes that will likely kick-start a dozen conversations.The filmmakers of THE DIVIDE knew what they were doing, and were very meticulous in setting up this group of survivors' fall from grace. The only problem being that just when we think we've seen the worst befall our characters, they manage to crank the inhumanity dial up to eleven, whereas I think they got their point across at around the seven or eight mark.

1526549,A2JWOACYFKJOGI,B007549W62,"A watcher and thinker ""Film Fan""","[1, 3]","I found this film on the shelf just recently by accident and thought I'd try it.  Well in moments it was memorizing, no build up and in just seconds we are faced with the onslaught of a nuclear war on tenants in an apartment block - no time to think - just run for the basement and get to safety. Only some make it, and the superintendant/janitor of the apartment block shuts and bolts his basement door, cutting others off, and then the waiting begins.It was fascinating to watch the very slow disintegration of the survivors mentality, as if it wasn't bad enough to be incarcerated in a basement with no windows and the sounds of war above, with apparently no food or water, and an angry Super who really didn't welcome the 'crowd' in his work area and private refuge, but then the realization that the survivors are slowly going mad.  I ended up waiting to see who was going to 'loose' it next and how, and that was nail biting, as all the time you feel desperately sorry for the weaker people, trying to survive with some of the dominant one's slowly banding together. The threat of violence erupting, feels just a whisper away.You start to realize that the women are in a particularly dangerous situation, as it the men are starting to loose control, getting into arguments, some of look like they will end in violence and some do.  However, the mental disintegration is slow, and the tension mounts.  When they are invaded, temporarily by the outsiders, and one is kidnapped, and the mother is distraught, the atmosphere becomes increasingly menacing, not just in the basement, but what is going to happen if the 'invaders' come back.Its chilling to discover, when one of the group make it out of the basement for a few minutes only to discover that the 'invaders' are experimenting on humans, and that's extremely sinister.  They then get sealed in the basement by the outsiders with several dead bodies, and the gruesome, but necessary task, of disposing of the bodies really seems to send most of the group over the edge and you see the signs of insanity emerging.  The treatment of one of the women by one of the insane guys is extremely harrowing to watch, and it just get worse and worse and you see the situation getting totally out of control with the extreme depravity of some of the group, and you are gripped by the fact that their madness is deepening.The only person who appears to remain sane, does really well to keep out of trouble for most of the film, though one senses there is extreme danger throughout, but somehow this person keeps out of the limelight. The craziness continues to get worse as the insane guys become crueler and crueler and more people die in so called 'mishaps'. You feel they are reverting to the 'starving rat syndrome' when they'll all kill or eat each other to survive, but madness is their enemy, not starvation, as they have been plundering the Super's food store - so nutrition isn't the issue.Eventually, just when things reach their crescendo of depravity, danger and extreme behavior, does the sane person win through, but in fact, surprisingly seals the fate of the remaining survivors, deliberately or accidently, they are shut in behind a coded locked door, and the survivor makes no attempt to help the others. That seemingly heartless act of self-survival plunges the escapee into yet another nightmare world of a totally destroyed world, without a safe atmosphere and surrounded by the remains of everything that has been vaporized, a world without hope.

Not so with THE DIVIDE. I was pleasantly surprised to see Michael Biehn (TERMINATOR) in one of the prime roles and thought that might nudge this film up a notch on my enjoyment meter. Again, not so.I also sincerely love post-apocalyptic films. How much so, you may ask? TANK GIRL is one of the films I enjoy. As is ZOMBIELAND, MAD MAX, and LOGAN'S RUN. Yup. I'm seriously into  them. So I sat down with this film hoping I might add it to my ""Dead Earth"" series (as I like to call them).But ...the main thing that makes these other films ""work"" where THE DIVIDE failed was sympathetic characters, a decent script, and an ending that actually was an ending (or at least made some sense). THE DIVIDE just seems to end with no resolution. No understanding of what actually happened to the world above (which the characters in this movie venture out into and find themselves a part of some sort of post nuclear holocaust experiment).I get that the producers/writers/directors were trying to show these people in a pressure cooker element (people of differing personalities and behaviors stuck in a basement together until they burst at their mental seams). But give us some empathy ...somewhere. When people started dying/killing off, I could've cared less. I was hoping they'd all die quickly so the movie would be over sooner. Seriously? Who cares if they were angry with this person or that person? I never knew any motivation behind anything anyone did.

The opening scene of a nuclear attack on New York is all you need to set up a group of survivors stuck in the basement to await the fallout.  But the movie takes so many twists and turns I was dumbstruck.  I've never had a movie leave my jaw hanging as much as this one and still continue to surprise scene after scene.  In the end you are left with an ""I can't believe that just happened"" feeling.What the movie was trying to do and what others seem to be missing, is set up what it would be like for people stuck in a basement experiencing the nuclear fallout.  How not only being cooped up in the basement with no hope for survival and all the psychological traps involved there, but also succumbing to the radiation of the blast and the toll that it took on the survivors.  This movie explores the what ifs of that scenario, one where there doesn't seem to be any hope for survival and yet they must all co-exist with one another.Granted it is dark and takes turns you wonder if it would have happened in real life, but in the end you accept it for what it is because each group of survivors is made up of a different group of personalities, and thus all reactions change.  I would recommend this definitely if you are ready for a mind trip.  Definitely not for everyone, but definitely worth watching and is best to go in to this one completely blind to the plot.

1526556,A3EJZJQCMRRFT2,B007549W62,Brian J. Mcmahon,"[5, 8]","The opening scenes for The Divide show us a firey nuclear hell unleashed on New York City, a mad dash to get out of a building, and finally we see a lucky few manage to force their way into a basement before the door is slammed shut. The stage has been set for what should be an interesting couple of hours. Maybe a dozen or so characters, seemingly a random bunch that just happened to make it into the same place at the same time.Unfortunately The Divide quickly begins falling apart in many ways. First, within apparently a few days of the total nuclear destruction of New York City an (theoretically) US government agency of some sort has set up shop outside the basement door. This agency is not FEMA out to find survivors and ferry them to safety; no, armed with machine guns, they are out to confront survivors and take by force any children among them, then kill off any adults.Although the sole child in the group is grabbed, injected, bagged, and wisked away from the group, the machine gun armed thugs in futuristic hazmat suits apparently have had almost no training in handling automatic weapons or finding and killing targets. What should have been meat on the table for these thugs turns into a catastrophic loss as they lose two of thier own, including weapons and the suits, for the loss of none of the survivors.The survivors, as well as the audience, wonders what the heck was that all about? So one of them suits up and ventures out. What we find is that this government agency appears to be conducting some kind of disections, tests, or experiments on children. It is near impossible to figure out what they are doing exactly, but what ever it is, it is barbaric, making these government agents seem like some evil aliens from another world. Predictibly, the survivor's disguise doesn't hold up long and he makes a mad dash for the basement, dropping and leaving the machine gun along the way.The government agency apparently decides that welding the door shut from the outside is the best way to keep the rats in the cage, so after this point in the story that door is never opened again. With all of the rats in a well sealed cage and limited supplies with no foreseeable way out, the survivors quickly degenerate into subhuman beings, driven by animal-like instincts and little regard for any kind of community spirit. We are shown torture (both physical and mental), and reapeated rape or attempted rape. Eventually this all leads to a predictable sole survivor who seems to be the one keeping a shred of humanity in an insane environment. This survivor's final act is to shed that last bit of regard for others and purposely abandon the last few to a horrible fate.In the end, the viewer will feel both robbed and cheated. Robbed of two hours of life. Robbed of any explanation for the actions of the mysterious government agency. Cheated by the director's insistance on repeatedly having seeming rational characters make irrational decisions for no plausible reason. Granted, this does happen in real life from time to time, but almost every character in the film repeatedly makes gratuitously bad decisions. It is also hardly believable that a group of somewhat average people would degenerate so quickly into psychotic excuses for humans. If the basement was located in the bottom of Rikers Island prison instead of an average apartment building, this story in this movie might have been a bit more plausible.",1,"Crazed, implausible, and wasted.",1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,3438,"['opening', 'scenes', 'Divide', 'show', 'firey', 'nuclear', 'hell', 'unleashed', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'mad', 'dash', 'get', 'building', 'finally', 'see', 'lucky', 'few', 'manage', 'force', 'way', 'basement', 'door', 'slammed', 'shut', 'stage', 'been', 'set', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'interesting', 'couple', 'hours', 'Maybe', 'dozen', 'so', 'characters', 'seemingly', 'random', 'bunch', 'just', 'happened', 'make', 'same', 'place', 'same', 'time.Unfortunately', 'Divide', 'quickly', 'falling', 'apart', 'many', 'ways', 'First', 'apparently', 'few', 'days', 'total', 'nuclear', 'destruction', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'theoretically', 'government', 'agency', 'sort', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'basement', 'door', 'agency', 'not', 'FEMA', 'find', 'survivors', 'ferry', 'safety', 'armed', 'machine', 'guns', 'are', 'confront', 'survivors', 'take', 'force', 'children', 'then', 'kill', 'off', 'sole', 'child', 'group', 'grabbed', 'injected', 'bagged', 'wisked', 'away', 'group', 'machine', 'gun', 'armed', 'thugs', 'futuristic', 'hazmat', 'suits', 'apparently', 'have', 'had', 'almost', 'training', 'handling', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'finding', 'killing', 'targets', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'meat', 'table', 'thugs', 'catastrophic', 'loss', 'lose', 'two', 'thier', 'own', 'including', 'weapons', 'suits', 'loss', 'none', 'survivors.The', 'survivors', 'as', 'well', 'audience', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'So', 'one', 'suits', 'up', 'ventures', 'out', 'What', 'find', 'government', 'agency', 'be', 'conducting', 'kind', 'disections', 'tests', 'experiments', 'children', 'near', 'impossible', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'ever', 'barbaric', 'making', 'government', 'agents', 'seem', 'evil', 'aliens', 'world', 'Predictibly', 'survivor', 'disguise', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'long', 'mad', 'dash', 'basement', 'dropping', 'leaving', 'machine', 'gun', 'way.The', 'government', 'agency', 'apparently', 'welding', 'door', 'shut', 'outside', 'best', 'way', 'keep', 'rats', 'cage', 'so', 'point', 'story', 'door', 'never', 'opened', 'again', 'rats', 'well', 'sealed', 'cage', 'limited', 'supplies', 'foreseeable', 'way', 'survivors', 'quickly', 'degenerate', 'subhuman', 'beings', 'driven', 'animal-like', 'instincts', 'little', 'regard', 'kind', 'community', 'spirit', 'are', 'shown', 'torture', 'physical', 'mental', 'reapeated', 'rape', 'attempted', 'rape', 'Eventually', 'predictable', 'sole', 'survivor', 'who', 'be', 'one', 'keeping', 'shred', 'humanity', 'insane', 'environment', 'survivor', 'final', 'act', 'shed', 'last', 'bit', 'regard', 'others', 'purposely', 'abandon', 'last', 'few', 'horrible', 'fate.In', 'end', 'viewer', 'will', 'feel', 'robbed', 'cheated', 'Robbed', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'Robbed', 'explanation', 'actions', 'mysterious', 'government', 'agency', 'Cheated', 'director', 'insistance', 'repeatedly', 'having', 'seeming', 'rational', 'characters', 'make', 'irrational', 'decisions', 'plausible', 'reason', 'Granted', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'time', 'time', 'almost', 'character', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'gratuitously', 'bad', 'decisions', 'also', 'hardly', 'believable', 'group', 'somewhat', 'average', 'people', 'would', 'degenerate', 'so', 'quickly', 'psychotic', 'excuses', 'humans', 'basement', 'was', 'located', 'bottom', 'Rikers', 'Island', 'prison', 'instead', 'average', 'apartment', 'building', 'story', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'plausible']","Divide, The"

The tenants of a high-rise apartment complex escape the nuclear devastation by hiding out in a bomb shelter beneath the building, but hunger, fear, and paranoia soon begin to tear them apart. This new post-apocalyptic vision follows the same running theme of societal breakdown that is present in many of George Romero's early films, only it is taken through to a much nastier conclusion. Just as we have seen in DAY OF THE DEAD, the trapped survivors quickly descend into the darkest depths of depravity once the veil of civilization has been lifted. Although it is very strongly executed by FRONTIERE(S) director Xavier Gens, THE DIVIDE pushes too hard, making the actions of its characters intolerable to watch. Many tangents are created but then never fully explored, leaving a number of questions unanswered as the film attempts to pick a direction. The timing of events also comes into question considering how quickly things fall into chaos.

A group of people in an apartment building fight their way to the bomb shelter below the building and wait.  The super of the building, played by Michael Biehn, is a total jerk and is very nasty to the other survivors.  None of the survivors seem to get along and there is a whole lot of arguing and fighting that ensues.  Most of the characters are thoroughly unlikeable and this is a real weakness of the film.  How are we supposed to care what happens to the survivors if we don't like them?  Another thing I did not like was how the survivors immediately turned on each other almost as soon as they reached the bomb shelter.  It did not seem that people in that situation would immediately start fighting one another.  Wouldn't they at least bond a little in their confusion and fear following a nuclear attack?  Wouldn't they try to work together at first?  Finally, the government comes but its not the rescue the survivors hoped for.  Things get even worse and desperate and things get very ugly and brutal as the survivors get even more hopeless and desperate.  This is not the feel good movie that you want to enjoy with your family.  I knew that going into this and even enjoy movies that don't always go for a happy ending.

I mean from the list of actors it seemed like it would be something I would be interested in but I was not and am not expecting much.I will be breaking this review into 30 min. chunks as I watch the movie. And I will pause the movie and jot down my thoughts on the movie's progression. I will not give away any spoilers just the general consensus.30 minutes in:So at this .30 min. in I'm not totally attached is moving I'm kind of watching it and doing other things not the kind of movie that grabs you from the start. And at this point you get the general idea of about how this movie is going to play out catastrophic world events people trapped together in a whole bunch of tension and craziness. So I will keep on watching and here I go.1 hour in:okay just stopped it one hour in the group is truly starting to fragment and the man in charge is starting to have is power/authority challenged. I mean I feel this movie is trying to be epic but I'm just not connected to any of the characters really. And the premise of what's going on in the outside world when you get to this point you be questioning the reality of the situation. Anyway unpausing now we'll see where it goes from here.Pause: Okay now about an hour and 3 min. and I got to say that combination safes seem to be impenetrable when the world goes to crazy! It is kind of funny.1:30 minutes in:okay it's official I'm bored... I mean at this point the story has me kind of lost not sure why characters are doing exactly what they're doing in a can really see the endgame and what that will be. I mean sure it's gruesome for the sake of gruesome witch I'm okay with kind of but I think if I cared these characters were and what they were capable and probably going to do to each other I might want to pay more attention. Let's see how this truth or Dare turns out? I'm not hopeful. Okay on to the last part of talk to you on the other side of it but I really am bored.The endOkay so I finally made it to the end and wow it wasn't that good. I'm enough to give too much away but I was expecting something to be revealed something like it was an experiment or something. The final scene with feelings of a character are probably similar to my feelings about this movie just empty.Now it's called the divide? It's just a strange movie to me I mean I love character development movies I like action I like apocalyptic concepts and survival. Sadly this movie just leaves me thinking this could have been a half-hour shorter and if they had developed the characters further I would've cared who lived who died and why. But to me it just didn't have that. And if you're reading this and have seen this movie who were the guys in the suits?

The movie starts like many other disaster-themed story lines, grouping a wide range of different archetypal characters.  Once enclosed in a claustrophobic environment, the group begins to work out their structure - each character with their own motives and fears.  I felt that within this build up, the story would then take a very typical road through conflict and resolution.  But instead, I found myself caught off guard with several misdirected story turns that really kept me on the edge of my seat.I felt that a theme of de-evolving society was redundant in today's apocalyptic genre, but this one focuses much more on the true horrors of that notion - individual break down.  What we see is much more than chaos or violence, it's the lack of hope.  After seeing this film I had a strong need to write this review, yet avoiding the spoilers makes it difficult.  To exactly point out why I thought this film was such a big surprise would also give away the impact of it.  There are many eerily well-paced and stylized scenes that stuck with me long after watching the movie.  Immediately after seeing the movie, I had this gut feeling that I had been through a traumatic roller coaster.  I had a sudden very real feeling of fear towards what humans could become, devoid of societal restraints.This movie will not be for those that dislike violence nor will it be for those that hope for buckets of gore.

Sadly, this one big mystery is never addressed ever again and instead, the movie descends into complete madness.It's one of those movies that makes you wonder how the actors can do what they did. I love apocalyptic fiction, but tend to find the psychotic aspect that some of these stories focus on to be extremely disturbing, disgusting, and just not for me. For example, the cannibal cult in Lucifer's Hammer or the department store freaks (though to be fair, those guys escaped from an asylum) and Macklin's camp in Swan Song. Perhaps I just have more faith in humanity, but the idea that people can be reduced to such animalistic, psychotic behavior makes my skin crawl.The Divide brings this exact type of creepy crawly feeling to life. I watched in horror as things just got worse and worse. It's an interesting psychological thriller that examines the basic human emotions and instincts such as love, jealousy, courage, and the need to survive but ultimately came down to what felt like a confusing mess. As I mentioned, a big mystery is revealed relatively early on and then is never, ever addressed again. If this was going to be the case, the mystery should never have been introduced in the first place.I was led to believe that this mystery was where the movie was going and it seemed really interesting, but the movie ended up being about human depravity and psychological torture.

1526570,A6J8D9V5S9MBE,B007549W62,Curtis G,"[1, 3]","After hearing Michael Biehn talking about ""The Divide"" on the Adam Carolla podcast, I was compelled to check it out. I've been a big fan of post-apocalyptic/post-nuclear movies since the early '80s, but this is decidedly not the post-apocalypse I was hoping for.The movie revolves around eight people who escape what appears to be a nuclear attack by hiding in the basement of their apartment building, until then solely occupied by the building's loner superintendent Mickey (Biehn). I say ""what appears to be"" because shortly after the cataclysm, someone comes knocking on the big steel door, attracted by the survivors' CB radio transmissions. In the movie's strangest and most illogical turn, armed men in rubber armor invade the shelter and are repelled by the survivors, but not before taking the only child hostage. (Which was sort of a relief, as the young actor's performance was almost painful to watch.) Later, one of the guys suits up and goes out to explore, and finds a labyrinth of lighted tunnels leading to more men in suits in a mobile laboratory. Who are they? Aliens? Military? Why are they taking children and what are they doing with them? After some gunfire and an implausible escape, this subplot is mostly forgotten.Certainly, some of the characters do some depraved things, but that's who they are. And really, that seems to be the premise of the movie: When all bets are off, how low will we sink? We never really get to know any of the characters (most movies would feature an early ""introduction roundtable"" scene), but now that I think about it, I'm OK with that choice. I didn't really care to know anyone's backstory, and anything I needed to know was revealed gradually, either through subtle dialogue or, better yet, their actions. Although there are some clues (falling hair, facial pallor), you never get a good sense of how much time has passed between events.Made on a low budget, the movie boasts some remarkable visual effects and interesting cinematography. One irritation was the looping (overdubbing) of the actors' voices, which tended to make most of the acting come across as bad, although it lent a surreal effect to Michael Eklund's (oh-so-disturbing) performance.Despite its grueling nature and unrelenting savagery, I found ""The Divide"" very entertaining and thought-provoking, even if it was uneven and went off on too many tangents.

Reminiscent of ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Omega Man"" and a hundred other movies in the past 50 years of people behaving badly towards one another when they're post-apocalytic stressed. In this case trapped in the basement of an apartment building soon after the opening scene of an atomic bomb destroying their city. The building's custodian has conveniently built into his basement abode a doomsday shelter stocked with food; a massive safe to store it in; a potty to the sewage system; some mysterious electrical source and a massive steel door into the complex. The point of the story is not in it's credibility but in displaying how nasty people can be so don't read the following if you don't want to know the problems.Story problems: First, no explanation of why an atomic bomb blast and to what worldwide extent. Second, that the custodian could afford an apartment basement fortress without the owners questioning it. Third, that he has his own unknown power source. Fourth, the bizarre behavior of the trapped people works for a movie but their overly obnoxious, not rational, me-first behavior didn't come across as believable, and it only got worse. Fifth, for some reason shortly after the blast a bio-suit armored group happen to have an acetylene torch to cut through a steel door which of the thousands of destroyed buildings they happened to pick. They suddenly attach miles of plastic tunnels to a crumbling apartment tower and for some never explained reason are keeping people in large incubation chambers with loads of lab equipment.

World War III and we've been hit by a nuclear attack.Eight residents of New York City clammer into the basement of their appartment building. The appartment superintendent seals the solid metal door. Our survivers are Eva and her boyfriend Sam, Josh and his brother Adrien, Josh's friend Bobby, Marilyn and her daughter Wendi, Devlin and Mickey.The basement, besides being Mickey's residence, is a bomb shelter. Mickey has canned goods put back, mainly beans. The bathroom is like an old fashioned out-house and instructions are given to scoop lime through the hold after use.In The Divide we feel like our survivors are within the three or four miles of the blast and therefore would suffer from radiation poisoning if they stepped outside.After several days, the shelter's door is broken from the outside and armed soldiers in biohazard suits enter. We're not privy to why but they take Marilyn's daughter. The rest of the survivors are able to kill two of the men and get a machine gun.More days pass. It's decided someone should go outside, wearing the untorn biohazard suit, to see how bad it is and to see if they can find the girl. They pick Josh, figuring he would come back because of his brother.Josh finds tunnels attached to the basement entrance, a lab, with several children sedated in containment units. He's recognized, so rushes back to the cellar losing the machine gun.The Divide is not for the faint of heart - they must chop up the dead, drop them in the outhouse and dust with lime.It's probably a fairly realistic picture of humanity lost.",4,The Divide highlights the worst side of humanity,1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,1661,"['Jim', 'Clark', 'publisher', 'Lee', 'County', 'Courier', 'Tupelo', 'MSIt', 'end', 'world', 'know', 'World', 'War', 'III', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hit', 'nuclear', 'attack.Eight', 'residents', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'clammer', 'basement', 'appartment', 'building', 'appartment', 'superintendent', 'seals', 'solid', 'metal', 'door', 'survivers', 'are', 'Eva', 'boyfriend', 'Sam', 'Josh', 'brother', 'Adrien', 'Josh', 'friend', 'Bobby', 'Marilyn', 'daughter', 'Wendi', 'Devlin', 'Mickey.The', 'basement', 'being', 'Mickey', 'residence', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'Mickey', 'canned', 'goods', 'put', 'back', 'mainly', 'bathroom', 'old', 'fashioned', 'out-house', 'instructions', 'are', 'given', 'scoop', 'lime', 'hold', 'use.In', 'Divide', 'feel', 'survivors', 'are', 'three', 'four', 'miles', 'blast', 'therefore', 'would', 'suffer', 'radiation', 'poisoning', 'stepped', 'outside.After', 'several', 'days', 'shelter', 'door', 'broken', 'outside', 'armed', 'soldiers', 'biohazard', 'suits', 'enter', ""'re"", 'not', 'privy', 'why', 'take', 'Marilyn', 'daughter', 'rest', 'survivors', 'are', 'able', 'kill', 'two', 'men', 'get', 'machine', 'gun.More', 'days', 'pass', 'decided', 'someone', 'should', 'go', 'wearing', 'untorn', 'biohazard', 'suit', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'see', 'can', 'find', 'girl', 'pick', 'Josh', 'figuring', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'brother.Josh', 'tunnels', 'attached', 'basement', 'entrance', 'lab', 'several', 'children', 'sedated', 'containment', 'units', 'recognized', 'rushes', 'back', 'cellar', 'losing', 'machine', 'gun.The', 'Divide', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'must', 'chop', 'up', 'dead', 'drop', 'outhouse', 'dust', 'lime.It', 'probably', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'picture', 'humanity', 'lost']","Divide, The"

They seal the door with tape so that none of the nuclear dust will get to them.  And then they proceed to demonstrate that they are all sociopathic psychotics with absolutely no redeeming human qualities.  They yell, they scream, they whine, they hoard, they betray, they rape, they sodomize, they torture, they dismember, they kill ... oh, and one guy puts on a dead woman's dress.

They are never explained and serve no purpose in the film.2. The ending has to have some shred of joy, hope, happiness or closure - this movie has none.

1526595,A11M305VVQ45H6,B007549W62,J P Villiard,"[3, 5]","Just when you thought that things couldn't get any worse during an apocalypse, along comes The Divide to prove to you just how much more depressing things can be.  The Divide tell the story of a group of 9 people who are forced into a nuclear bomb shelter when a nuclear war breaks out in the world above them.  Among the group is Micky (played by Michael Beihen), the owner of the shelter, who is none to pleased with having to share his new residence and the supplies inside of it with the other people.  Micky barks orders, makes snide and racist comments, and generally acts like an ass to everyone else while the world outside can be heard being destroyed by explosions.  Micky eventually learns that treating everyone like a jerk is a bad way to form solidarity amongst a group of people.... unless you want them to be in solidarity against YOU.  He learns this lesson too late as the group becomes tired of his antics and revolts against him, taking him prisoner in his own ""home.""From there, the remaining group members degenerate,  Morals begin to decay, despair at the likelihood that they'll never be saved starts to take it's toll, and living conditions become disgusting.  This results in a ""divide"" (probably the reason why the movie gets its name) between two factions of people.  They consist of those who are miserable and doing nothing, and those who are miserable and acting like degenerates.  The latter group hoards all of the food and supplies in an attempt to force the former group into joining them in their debauchery, which includes repeatedly raping one of the female survivors and acting like swine.  The whole situation continues to break down until there is a final confrontation between the two factions.The movie does a great job of painting a bleak picture of what would obviously be a horrible situation.  The bunker is dark and uncomfortable.  The conditions become so bad that you can almost smell the stench building up through your screen.  Also, the acting is decent, and everyone is believable in their rolls.  However, the good aspects of this movie stop there.Though the first 20 minutes or so are filled with a good amount of suspense and intrigue, the majority of the film is depressing and boring.  For over an hour and a half (the remained of this film), the audience is treated to multiple rapes, lude references, people deficating on the floor, whining, body dismemberment, and some very dull conversations.  While I understand that the director is trying to convey just how bad this situation is, 90+ minutes is way more than what is needed to make this point.  In fact, it actually becomes torturesome for the viewer to have to sit through much of this just to see the conclussion of the movie.  We are also treated to images of everyone suffering the affects of radiation poisoning and unsanitary condition, EXCEPT for the character of Eva (played by Lauren German) who seems to keep relatively clean, well-kept, and intact despite the lack of showers and exposure to radiation.  Why?  I don't know, but I think it might have something to do with the fact that she's cute.The characters, though well-played by the actors, are two-dimensional at best.  We have hardly any backstory on them, and while it isn't always necessary to have long histories about each character, it is troublesome for this movie.  This is particularly true in the case of Michael Beihen's character.  He obviously has some deep-rooted hatered burning inside of him, but we never get to see why.  We get a glimps or two of some pictures of his life prior to the war, but nothing is ever explained about what happened to that life.  With no backstory and little of anything else, we are never given much of a reason to like any of the characters early on in the movie.  And as the show wears on, the few reasons we did have to like any of them are stripped away until all of them become deplorable.  By the time this movie is over, it's hard not to find yourself hoping to see all of them die.There's also the case of the masked ""soldiers"" who invade the compound early on, and kidnap the youngest member of the group.  Did I forget to mention them?  Well, that's ok, because after they make their grand entrance a half-hour into the movie, the writers forgot about them, too.  This is a shame, as these individuals shake things in the bunker up quite nicely.  They break, grab a girl, shoot some rounds to scare the other survivors, and leave with the girl (still screaming) shoved into a plastic, biohazard bag.  Shortly after, the group attempts to see what's going on outside (and to rescue the hostaged girl) using a biohazard suit that taken from a soldier they killed during the altercation.  A man is sent outside, and he discovers a group of scientists/soldiers similar to the ones that attacked them conducting experiments, as well as an area where children (including the one who was kidnapped) are being kept in some type of suspended animation for an unknown purpose.  After the advernturer is chased back to the bunker, the door to the shelter is sealed shut.... and none of these things are ever dealt with again.  The soldiers... their ""lab"".... the children they've got locked away like lab rats.... all of this could've made this movie 100 times more interesting, but instead it is all forgotten and used as an excuse to have the bunker welded shut (a feat that could've easily been solved with a cave-in of the buildings above over the shelter without leaving as many unanswered questions or causing as much confussion).Probably my worst complaint is the end of this movie.  The final five minutes feature a character making decisions that do not make any sense for them, and performing an escape attempt from the bunker that is so remarkably simple, everyone else inside looks dumber for not having thought of it sooner.Overall, this movie had lots of potential, but eventually deteriorates into a waste of time.",2,Just when you thought that the end of the world

The plot (group of people trapped in confined space) has been done over and over in different settings, nothing new there. There are plenty of post-apocalyptic movies out there that are much, much better.Honestly, you would think scriptwriters could learn how to use the internet, since it is fairly obvious they have no practical education in using a library. I have a number of problems with this film, most having to do with filmmakers completely ignoring anything resembling reality. (You can go to ready.gov to read about nuclear blast emergencies, and what to do in case of one)***********Spoilers**************1. If you were that close to the blast they watch, it's game over. The flash travels at the speed of light, the following blast wave travels at the speed of sound (approximately 768 mph). At the very least, they would have been blind. Yet, they make it to the basement with no ill effects. They never show a blast wave. Quite some time later the building falls without crashing through the basement.2. They are fairly close to the blast. Accute radiation sickness kills in under 48 hours, depends on your level of exposure. They only show some signs of radiation sickness (bleeding gums and hair loss), what you would expect from someone a distance away from the blast site. They never show signs of nausea, they eat and eat and eat all through the movie. They never get infections, even the guy who gets shot. Based on the symptoms they DO show, 50% of them should have been dead within 4-6 weeks.3. EMP. Ok, lets say their electrical equipment survives. Where, exactly, is the electricity they are using coming from?4. They are worried about fallout but never close off the ventilation system. DUH5. The people that come in and steal the little girl make no sense. When the guy goes out there, he does so to no purpose. They are then sealed in by the people outside. Completely pointless. If someone kidnaps a kid, shoot first, ask later.6. At the end, why is the concrete building burning? Gasoline explodes, it is not a slow burn. You cannot use gasoline in a lamp. BTW, concrete DOES NOT BURN. That basement survived a nuclear blast, but went up like a dry wood building from less than a pop bottle of fuel in a lamp. Get real.As for the characters in the movie, no one ever shows the least bit of ""good"" humanity, it is all about how people are selfish and weak, cowardly and cruel. Which is true to some extent, but I find it hard to believe out of a group of people, NONE would have any redeeming qualities AT ALL. (Or go nuts and try to kill everyone.)

Love it or hate it, one thing is certain: this is a movie that seems destined to polarize (or divide) its audience.  Its supporters will call it a modern masterpiece.  Guaranteed.  Its strongest detractors will call it a nihilistic mess.  Absolutely.  Maybe its both--a modern messy nihilistic masterpiece.  For the most part, the film was savaged by the mainstream media.  On the other hand, the movie seemed to connect with audiences at key film festivals including Edinburgh, SXSW, Fant-Asia, and Toronto After Dark.  So I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.  Make no mistake, the goal of Gens is to provoke and push buttons with his uncompromisingly unpleasant look at people pushed to extremes.  And any film that can elicit strong emotions--good or bad--is a rarity in this movie world where we make homogenized formula pieces designed by committee.""The Divide"" literally starts with the end of the world as we know it.  As a nuclear attack ravages the city, a small band of survivors makes it to safety in their apartment building basement.  This disparate group seem well supplied for the moment thanks to the brusque building super (Michael Biehn) who instantly takes on the alpha male position.  Amidst the usual squabbles, pettiness, and annoyances--their plan to wait out the radiation takes a radical turn when the outside world invades in a dangerously uncomfortable way.  As time passes, the group faces increasingly unpleasant choices and this little microcosm of society starts to break down in harrowing and disturbing ways.  Although the film is marketed as a horror film, in no way do I see it in this context.  This is a straight-out drama about people trapped in close quarters disintegrating into madness and desperation--and, on those terms, I found it wildly effective and affecting.  It's not an easy experience, but it's a memorable one.The movie never attempts to explain what's happening in the real world in any tangible way.  It is this uncertainty that drives the story's fear.  I'm giving ""The Divide"" a strong recommendation not because it's a perfect movie (far from it), but because it takes a familiar concept and really swings for the fences.  It is bold and pushes conventional boundaries.  As I already said, this may cause you to loathe the movie.  And that's a perfectly reasonable response.  I take an alternate viewpoint, this is a movie that really stands out.  The characters can be instantly unlikable or over-the-top and the screenplay pushes too hard in the initial confrontations, but as the movie settles into its rhythm--I was fully on board for this claustrophobic nightmare.  In addition to Biehn, there are other familiar faces including Rosanna Arquette, Milo Ventimiglia, Ashton Holmes, and Courtney B. Vance.  The cast is really committed to go to dark places and is led by moral compass Lauren German in a nicely understated contrast.In the end, ""The Divide"" may be a gamble (especially for those expecting a horror film).

1526607,A3K7H7RBZZ8DGD,B007549W62,"Laura Probst ""dragon wench""","[2, 4]","I admit it.  I don't like ugly movies.  Call me frivolous, accuse me of having as much depth as a puddle, I don't care.  When I watch a movie, it's not to have a mirror held up to human nature and see what dark, devious depths are reflected within.  I watch a movie to be entertained, to be taken away from the ills of the world.  The Divide is an UGLY movie; I felt the same way after watching it as I did after watchingBlindness:  disturbed, violated, depressed, haunted.  In fact, if you want a really fun movie night, watch the two movies back-to-back.  If you don't want to vomit and curl up in a fetal ball on bathroom floor afterwards, you're a much stronger person than I.At the technical/artistic level, I can admire The Divide.  The story is strong (for the most part), compellingly told with bravura performances by all the actors; the setting is claustrophobic, with a disgustingly realistic art and prop design.  Other than a certain whoopsie in the plot, which introduced a rather nonsensical and never fully explained story element, we're moved along without a hitch as the film explores what it takes for humans to devolve into monsters.  The movie starts off with some sort of nuclear attack on some American city; we're never told who is behind the attack, though the characters have their own particular theories.  We watch as the tenants of an apartment building race downstairs to find shelter; only a few manage to push past the building manager guarding the door of an underground bunker before he locks the door in place.  And so the story begins.  How long will the food last?  What about the water?  How long before all the ingrained cultural behaviors, such as kindness, charity, consideration, break down and our inner animal behaviors, such as greed, envy, destruction, come out in force?  In the end, as the characters try to break free from what ultimately becomes a prison, the question becomes, Was surviving the nuclear blast a salvation?For the most part the movie flows as we watch these nine people spiral downwards, losing the veneer civilization places upon them and becoming more base until, at the end, most aren't even recognizable as human beings.  We see the paranoia take hold, the despair grow, the utter resignation to their fate invade their bodies like cancer.  However, the movie takes an odd turn early on, introducing a ""What the heck was that about?"" plot point:  ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*** A group of hazmat-attired men with guns and weird helmet-masks break into the bunker, examine and then abduct one of the characters, a little girl named Wendi, the daughter of Rosanna Arquette's character, Marilyn, and then try to kill the remaining characters.  The characters overcome the intruders, killing a couple of them, before once more locking themselves into the bunker.  Later, Josh, played by Milo Ventimiglia, puts on one of the hazmat suits and ventures out to find out what's going on.  What he finds is an airlock tube attached to the outside of the bunker's door and a lab staffed by more mystery hazmat-suited men... and Wendi, along with other children, shaved and with tubes sticking out of their mouths, comatose in isolation capsules.  Josh gets discovered and barely makes it back to the bunker alive, but instead of coming back in and wiping Josh and the others out, the mystery men weld the bunker door shut.  So now the survivors are well and truly trapped, and this is where the depravity begins.  We're never told who those mystery men are, what agency or even country they work for, or what the hell they were doing.  To me it seemed as though they only existed for their hazmat suits, which played a part in the movie's finale.  Otherwise, they served no reasonable purpose.  Also, the character played by Lauren German, Eva, must've had a secret cache of shampoo and soap, not to mention extra water:  As the other characters degenerate and deteriorate, growing pale and wan, developing dark circles underneath their eyes; as their greasy hair falls out from malnutrition and their gums bleed, as their skin and clothing become foul with dirt, grease, and bodily fluids, Eva remains relatively unscathed.  Her hair stays clean looking, her skin remains glowing; even her clothing stays decent.  It's only until near the very end that she shows signs of deprivation.  Frankly, if anyone should've inspired paranoia of food hoarding, it should've been Eva.While I can admire the film, that doesn't mean I like it, and I don't.  Certainly, scenes from the movie haunt me; even now, as I write this, I can see bits of it playing out in my head.  And I hate that, because I don't want to carry that ugliness with me.  As I said before, I want to movies to uplift me, to delight me, to take me away from reality for a couple of hours so I can smile, laugh, and be ignorant of the world around me.  A world, I might add, which holds enough ugliness in it without needing any fictional window dressing.  I don't know what kind of person I'd become should I be involved in some sort of survival-of-the-fittest situation, but I know how others would change:  Some would become even greater than before, some would remain the same, while most would happily embrace the monster within as they gleefully gave in to their worst impulses.  I already know this.  I don't want to watch it happen if I don't have to.",2,Technical/artistic rating:  4 stars; Personal rating:  1 star; Cumulative rating:  2.5 (let's round down to 2) stars.,1339977600,"06 18,

This film however is something diiferent. The original cataclysm is barely shown and is never explained - we never learn what exactly happened. The whole story is in fact a study in the slow but certain disappearance of all social order and even purely human reflexes amongst a group of people who are trapped in a cage without exit (an underground shelter) and with dwindling food and water supply...The film is full of incredibly vulgar language - it seems that absolutely everybody speaks with the ""F"" bomb beginning every sentence. There are purely obscene moments of sexual nature (nothing to do with love-making). Excrements, menstrual blood, rotting bodies and swarming cockroaches, all play considerable role by moments. There are very graphic scenes of murder, rape and torture. In one word, this film has more in common with ""Saw"" franchise than with SF movies. This is most of the plot and of the scenario - and this film REALLY disgusted me.I would rate this thing one star, if it was not for the last five minutes, which contain one pretty cruel but really intelligent twist, which I didn't see coming at all. I also must admit that actors did a rather good job and the cast is strong: Michael Biehn, Rosanna Arquette, Courtney B. Vance, Milo Ventimiglia and Ashton Holmes all did very well.

1526611,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007549W62,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","I'm amazed at the movies that depict the results of a nuclear war and how they've changed over the years. In the past, during my childhood years, there was always a sense of hope and cooperation between survivors in those films. During my teen years we were treated to the terrifying glimpse of the reality of the results of this form of war. And now as I've grown older, it seems a new generation feels that man can not do anything but remain destructive and petty. Where has all the hope gone?THE DIVIDE opens with a nuclear bomb going off while Eva (Lauren German) watches from the window in her high rise apartment. Her boyfriend grabs her arm and they rush off down the stairs hoping to find an escape. Instead when they get to the lobby, they find themselves nearly crushed as the tide of people come running back in to avoid the blast wave and, fortunately for them, they have the chance to join a few that have made it to a bomb shelter in the basement.The shelter was kept up by the apartment building's super, Mickey (Michael Biehn). And Mickey now intends to rule this basement as he sees fit, sharing what he has with the rest but by with certain restrictions. Some of the people want to leave but Mickey explains to them that the dust from the bomb will make the chances of survival outside next to impossible. It's better to wait it out till things settle.Tempers and egos flare as each person wants to make their own decisions, failing to take into consideration that simply opening the door could do them all in. The posturing of males wanes back and forth while Mickey still controls them all in his most unpleasant manner.The psychological aspects of being alive but trapped in a shelter play out throughout this film offering us little hope in a world where people care about one another but would rather focus on themselves only. Eventually help does arrive or so it seems. Instead the protective suited armed group that enters doesn't aid all but just a little girl in their midst. When members of this group later try to find out what's going on, the military welds shut the door and leaves them to themselves. Will they release them later? Who knows?Before that day can happen the group begins to change. Not only physically but mentally as well. Life among the living deteriorates and the basest behaviors are displayed among them all. It becomes a sad tale in a world where insane attitudes seem to rule.I'm not averse to movies that depict the world as it is. But it seems that these days a younger generation seems to have no hope in mankind or the world we live in. We've gone from a world where a generation dreamed of reaching to the stars to a world where we accept defeat at the hands of bombs. A new generation of film makers seems to see the worst mankind has to offer and expects that to be the norm rather than the exception. Then again with the self absorbed youths of today perhaps they're on to something.It may seem as if I've revealed quite a bit about this movie, but most of it could have been witnessed in the trailer. There is much more that happens and all of it depressing as Hell. to me that's not entertainment. I couldn't find much that I could recommend about this film unless none of the things mentioned bothers you. Director Xavier Gens also made the film FRONTIERS which many touted as the best film they'd seen in years. I found that movie to be more disturbing than entertaining as well. But if you liked that one my guess is you'll enjoy this as well.

While one of the most impressive apocalyptic movies in recent cinema, it is relentlessly brutal, often perverse and a real downer.  Director Xavier Gen offers a slow, deliberate pace that lingers on every disturbing sequence, resulting in a movie experience that left me feeling drained.  Nonetheless, the cast is superlative, each actor offering brave, committed performances that are remarkable.Michael Biehn who has eluded ""star"" status despite his roles in megahits like ALIENS and TERMINATOR is brilliant as the building super who conditionally offers aid to his co-survivors.  There is an underlying sense of sadness to the former fireman who obviously suffered a deep personal loss on 9/11.  Rosanna Arquette is devastating as the mother whose loss of her daughter sends her spiralling into a sexual decadence that is overwhelming.  HEROES' Milo Ventimiglia is chilling and frightening as the sociopathic Josh, cruel, sadistic and barbaric.  A star-making turn for sure.  Richard Eklund as Bobby--OMG what a brutal performance!  A modern day Caligula who steals every scene he's in.  Then there's Lauren Germann as Eve, the supposed moral center of the group whose descent into cold self-centeredness is unfortunately realistic.  Ashton Holmes emerges as the most sympathetic character, who maintains a semblance of humanity.  Ivan Gonzales as nerdish Sam is a complex mix of cowardness and pent-up rage.  Even Courtney B.

1526614,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B007549W62,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","""The Divide"" is one of those films that could easily be a play.  It takes place exclusively in a bomb shelter where several survivors have fled after a nuclear blast. The apartment tenants have no idea what happened, and they are largely at the mercy of the superintendent, Mickey (Michael Beihn). The survivors all have relationships with each other - some are failed at relationships like Eva (Lauren German) and Sam (Ivan Gonzalez), others are broken families like half-brothers Bobby (Michael Eklund) and Adrien (Ashton Holmes).  What starts out as merely survival unravels in a post-apocalyptic tale where there are no good guys, only survivors.At first the team is united in survival and threatened only by their worst fears, but gradually that changes as the existential threat of outsiders becomes very real. Soldiers break into the room in biohazard suits and kidnap a child, representing the last hope of the survivors.  The survivors manage to fight them off and then even turn the tables for a little while; ""The Divide"" is notable in that many films of this type would leave the threat unseen off screen.  Here, ""The Divide"" shows you what's on the other side, and the knowledge only makes things that much worse.The soldiers decide to weld the survivors in, and then things go from bad to awful. The group splits into two, the divide of the title, each side claiming a woman. They barter for food, water, electricity, and sex, and the imbalance between the two groups gradually turns into a rift as it becomes clear who has the upper hand. It's not long before Eva realizes that there is no hope for her when she finally decides to take her fate into her own hands.There are no happy endings here; no heroes, no good guys - just bad guys, and worse guys, and they are always, always guys.  This is not a feel-good film.  It is a brooding insight into the awfulness of human nature at its worst. It's also a refreshingly zombie-free meditation on the horror of being alone with other people.",3,Bad guys and worse guys,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,2004,"['Divide', 'one', 'films', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'play', 'place', 'exclusively', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'where', 'several', 'survivors', 'have', 'fled', 'nuclear', 'blast', 'apartment', 'tenants', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'largely', 'mercy', 'superintendent', 'Mickey', 'Michael', 'Beihn', 'survivors', 'have', 'relationships', 'other', 'are', 'failed', 'relationships', 'Eva', 'Lauren', 'German', 'Sam', 'Ivan', 'Gonzalez', 'others', 'are', 'broken', 'families', 'half-brothers', 'Bobby', 'Michael', 'Eklund', 'Adrien', 'Ashton', 'Holmes', 'What', 'out', 'merely', 'survival', 'unravels', 'post-apocalyptic', 'tale', 'where', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'only', 'first', 'team', 'united', 'survival', 'threatened', 'only', 'worst', 'fears', 'gradually', 'existential', 'threat', 'outsiders', 'becomes', 'very', 'real', 'Soldiers', 'break', 'room', 'biohazard', 'suits', 'kidnap', 'child', 'representing', 'last', 'hope', 'survivors', 'survivors', 'manage', 'fight', 'off', 'then', 'even', 'turn', 'tables', 'little', 'while', 'Divide', 'notable', 'many', 'films', 'type', 'would', 'leave', 'threat', 'unseen', 'off', 'screen', 'Here', 'Divide', 'what', 'other', 'side', 'knowledge', 'only', 'things', 'much', 'worse.The', 'soldiers', 'decide', 'weld', 'survivors', 'then', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'awful', 'group', 'two', 'divide', 'title', 'side', 'claiming', 'woman', 'barter', 'food', 'water', 'electricity', 'sex', 'imbalance', 'two', 'groups', 'gradually', 'rift', 'clear', 'who', 'upper', 'hand', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'Eva', 'hope', 'when', 'finally', 'take', 'fate', 'own', 'are', 'happy', 'endings', 'here', 'heroes', 'good', 'guys', 'just', 'bad', 'guys', 'worse', 'guys', 'are', 'always', 'always', 'guys', 'not', 'feel-good', 'film', 'brooding', 'insight', 'awfulness', 'human', 'nature', 'worst', 'also', 'refreshingly', 'zombie-free', 'meditation', 'horror', 'being', 'alone', 'other', 'people']","Divide, The"

1526616,AGOEKVIJV9UX6,B007549W62,Mr. Markster,"[11, 20]","If you are looking for a good end of the world sci-fi / horror film to watch, saw the trailer to ""The Divide"" and plan to watch it over the weekend, just beware. The Divide is not intended for mainstream audiences. Many people looking for a typical end-of-the-world thriller will likely walk away wondering where the entertainment value was and why would somebody make a movie like this.I love a good bloody horror movie- but be warned: ""The Divide"" is HARDCORE. It is an unsanitized look at the downward spiral into madness and human depravity. The violence is hardcore. This is an incredibly unflinching, ugly and utterly disturbing movie. If your stomach isn't strong enough to handle prolonged scenes of rape, torture and on-going acts of gut-wrenching human depravity, then STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE! Just remember, you cannot ""unsee"" something.All warnings aside, ""The Divide"" isn't a bad movie at all. In fact, the movie is utterly convincing at setting its tone and mood very early on.The basic premise is simple: a handful of people running to escape nuclear holocaust end up in an old basement of their apartment building. At first they don't dare open the door to go outside in fear of radiation poisoning. The small group of individuals immediately don't mix very well and it doesn't take long before they are fighting over their food supply, who is going to be the leader, etc. However, something happens and the group gets permanently locked in the basement with no hope of escape. This is when things start to spiral out of control.The movie's point of view (POV) is that of the survivors: We know what they know- period. We are trapped in the basement with them. We have no answers to the multitude of questions that get raised about the world on the other side of the basement door. Some viewers may not like that many things go unanswered. However, it is everything that IS left UNEXPLAINED which causes the descent into chaos.The gradual build up to utter chaos and the slow descent into madness is incredibly palpable, and the first hour or so becomes incredibly intense and un-nerving.This is where The Divide really shines: its feeling of dread, claustrophobia and helplessness is absolutely incredible. Of course, the most important ""character"" of the movie (if you want to call it that) is the basement in which they are all trapped. The basement sets the tone for the entire move: it is ugly, dimly lit, cruel and forboding.Once things spiral out of control, audiences will be divided:1- some will appreciate the movie's raw approach to the chaos that unfolds on the screen;2- others will be disgusted and disturbed;3- and yet some others will think the movie goes completely off the rails and over the top in a tasteless attempt to assault and shock its viewers.Personally, I enjoyed the build up much more than I did the payoff. I guess I'm one of those people who fall into the second category- I wasn't expecting what was coming and I was left utterly disturbed. The last 50 minutes of the movie is a non-stop onslaught of gruesome events.Not only is the violence hard to endure, but these are not nice people to begin with... when their physical appearance slowly deteriorates due to radiation poisoning (the makeup is incredibly well done) the ugliness of their rotting flesh mirror the the demonic manifestations of their souls.""The Divide"" drips with atmosphere and descends its viewer into an unflinching, unforgiving, inescapable hell. The sign of a good movie is that it accomplishes its goal, and the Divide's goal is to disturb its audience.PQ is okay, but nothing extraordinary. The picture is dark, dirty and probably not that much superior to standard DVD- although clarity tends to be nice and crisp. Definitely not a polished, demo-worthy image by any stretch... but it was probably also intended to be filmed that way, as the grittiness of the PQ only adds to the overall dark atmosphere.I can't say ""The Divide"" is a fun movie to watch.

Don't read reviews, don't view the trailer again and again, just watch it. But be warned, it is disturbing. I blind bought it and I am glad I did. Worth multiple viewings. ***It is hard to rate a movie like The Divide and I'm hesitant to say I liked it due to being judged as a psychopath. I'm not going to tell my mom about it, but I actually like this movie. Yes movie, not film. It is very fast paced yet patient as it cooks the crazy in each of the tenant's minds while they're stuck in the basement/bunker. The movie starts off with a bang and never lets up. It gets more and more intense as it goes on. At first I found the acting a bit cheesy, however as the movie went on each character became more interesting and well played.The movie is violent, disturbing, un-nerving, and sometimes makes you squirm in your seat. There is a little twist here or there, however not much is really explained. You know what they know and nothing more. You are viewing the people experiencing this tragedy and you are locked in that basement with them. If you are one of those people who have to know why something happened or try and make sense of the madness, you may not like this movie. It is not a thinking movie however it projects the psychological effects of being confined to a small space with a bunch of people with little food and water. The beginning of the movie started to annoy me because I wanted answers. Why did the city blow up? Was it bombed? But as the movie progressed I understood that the explosion had really nothing to do with the movie, it is all about the people and the toll it takes on the mind.Michael Biehn and Lauren German were brilliant and strong characters in The Divide. Milo Ventimiglia also had a very intense character to play. There were times where I was laughing (more in the beginning) due to the interaction between the tenants as not all of them get along. It is quite a rapid turn from the beginning of the movie to the end.The PQ and AQ are both very good. The PQ is sharp, yet a little grainy as the director indented. The graininess really adds something to this movie and I 100% appreciate it. The AQ is crystal clear and at a good level blows you away with the intensity of the actions on the screen. It is a great movie to give you subwoofer a workout. There also is an almost constant buzz of the lights throughout.Do I recommend The Divide? Yes, I do. Is it worth multiple viewings? Yes, I very much think so. It is one of those movies that wasn't great, however it will sit and stew around in your head for weeks to come and it will become one of those guilty little pleasure movies that you watch every once and a while and enjoy it.Recommended for the post-apocalyptic psychological movie fans.",4,A Division of Humanity,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,2797,"['***', 'less', 'know', 'movie', 'better', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'view', 'trailer', 'again', 'again', 'just', 'watch', 'be', 'warned', 'disturbing', 'blind', 'bought', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'Worth', 'multiple', 'viewings', '***It', 'hard', 'rate', 'movie', 'Divide', ""'m"", 'hesitant', 'say', 'liked', 'due', 'being', 'judged', 'psychopath', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'mom', 'actually', 'movie', 'Yes', 'movie', 'not', 'film', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'yet', 'patient', 'crazy', 'tenant', 'minds', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'basement/bunker', 'movie', 'bang', 'never', 'up', 'more', 'more', 'intense', 'first', 'found', 'acting', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'however', 'movie', 'went', 'character', 'became', 'more', 'interesting', 'well', 'played.The', 'movie', 'violent', 'disturbing', 'un-nerving', 'sometimes', 'squirm', 'seat', 'little', 'twist', 'here', 'there', 'however', 'not', 'much', 'really', 'explained', 'know', 'what', 'know', 'nothing', 'more', 'are', 'viewing', 'people', 'experiencing', 'tragedy', 'are', 'locked', 'basement', 'are', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'know', 'why', 'something', 'happened', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'madness', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'not', 'thinking', 'movie', 'however', 'projects', 'psychological', 'effects', 'being', 'confined', 'small', 'space', 'bunch', 'people', 'little', 'food', 'water', 'beginning', 'movie', 'started', 'annoy', 'wanted', 'answers', 'Why', 'did', 'city', 'blow', 'up', 'bombed', 'movie', 'progressed', 'understood', 'explosion', 'had', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'people', 'toll', 'mind.Michael', 'Biehn', 'Lauren', 'German', 'were', 'brilliant', 'strong', 'characters', 'Divide', 'Milo', 'Ventimiglia', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'intense', 'character', 'play', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'was', 'laughing', 'more', 'beginning', 'due', 'interaction', 'tenants', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'quite', 'rapid', 'turn', 'beginning', 'movie', 'end.The', 'PQ', 'AQ', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'PQ', 'sharp', 'yet', 'little', 'grainy', 'director', 'indented', 'graininess', 'really', 'something', 'movie', '100', '%', 'appreciate', 'AQ', 'crystal', 'clear', 'good', 'level', 'blows', 'away', 'intensity', 'actions', 'screen', 'great', 'movie', 'give', 'subwoofer', 'workout', 'also', 'almost', 'constant', 'buzz', 'lights', 'throughout.Do', 'recommend', 'Divide', 'Yes', 'do', 'Is', 'worth', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'Yes', 'very', 'much', 'think', 'so', 'one', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'however', 'will', 'sit', 'stew', 'head', 'weeks', 'come', 'will', 'become', 'one', 'guilty', 'little', 'pleasure', 'movies', 'watch', 'once', 'while', 'enjoy', 'it.Recommended', 'post-apocalyptic', 'psychological', 'movie', 'fans']","Divide, The"
1526623,A1ADEVDXQLIUXB,B007549W62,"Patrick S. Dorazio ""Author of The Dark Trilogy""","[2, 6]","The Divide is a bare bones apocalyptic tale that starts moments after the world dies.  Nuclear bombs have been dropped on Manhattan and several people living in an apartment complex rush to the fallout shelter the super has created in the basement.  The Super's intention was to go it alone, but his tenant's force their way in as everyone above is dying from the blasts.  Almost the entire movie takes place in this shelter with the survivors initially planning on waiting until the radiation has died down before they check things out on the surface.  They have food, water, and power, so things seem to be okay at first-the best they can be based on the circumstances-but things begin to erode and there are various struggles for power and control among the characters.There is a nudge from the outside world as soldiers invade the shelter and disrupt the relative calm early on in the movie.  The audience is given little information on these soldiers, what is going on up above, or why they end up doing what they do to the group.  The movie's focus is on the dynamics of the nine people in the shelter and injects external influence only in two small, somewhat confusing doses.The name of the movie is apropos on several levels.  There is the obvious divide between the world above and world within the shelter, the multiple divides that occur with the group as it changes and morphs over the course of the movie, and the divide among viewers of this film on whether it is a realistic portrayal of people trying to survive under nearly unthinkable circumstances or is gratuitous and over the top in many ways.This movie is a grim, dark, and dank experiment where the characters are put in a box and the audience gets to watch their humanity dissolve.  There are power struggles to control resources, trust issues, alliances formed and broken, and the continuous erosion of any sense of civility from start to finish of this film.  This story revolves around choices-how far are you willing to go, what depths are you willing to sink to...what will you do not only to survive, but to maintain control over yourself and those around you?  It pulls no punches, showing the dark, ugly side of what we all have the potential of becoming under nightmarish conditions.The Divide is a mixed bag.  I can't say that I bought into the Roseanna Arquette character and her rapid transformation from loving mother to willing rape victim, and some of the other characters were a stretch as far as believability, especially as the tale progressed.  I was somewhat confused by the soldiers and why it was necessary to bring them into the story-they could have not shown up and the tale would have progressed just fine, for the most part.  I also felt that at two hours run time, the movie could have sliced out about twenty minutes or so and still presented the same tale-it seemed to drag in places.  Even with these complaints, the movie drew me in and kept me interested as the characters warped from being normal people to survivors buried deep in a hole and knowing they will never break free of the prison they're in.  It's not a film that I think I will ever have the urge to watch again, but I will remember it for a long time come.",3,A House Divided,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,3229,"['Divide', 'bare', 'bones', 'apocalyptic', 'tale', 'moments', 'world', 'Nuclear', 'bombs', 'have', 'been', 'dropped', 'Manhattan', 'several', 'people', 'living', 'apartment', 'complex', 'rush', 'fallout', 'shelter', 'super', 'created', 'basement', 'Super', 'intention', 'was', 'go', 'alone', 'tenant', 'force', 'way', 'everyone', 'dying', 'blasts', 'Almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'place', 'shelter', 'survivors', 'initially', 'planning', 'waiting', 'radiation', 'died', 'down', 'check', 'things', 'out', 'surface', 'have', 'food', 'water', 'power', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'okay', 'first-the', 'can', 'be', 'based', 'circumstances-but', 'things', 'begin', 'erode', 'are', 'various', 'struggles', 'power', 'control', 'characters.There', 'nudge', 'outside', 'world', 'soldiers', 'invade', 'shelter', 'disrupt', 'relative', 'calm', 'early', 'movie', 'audience', 'given', 'little', 'information', 'soldiers', 'what', 'going', 'why', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'group', 'movie', 'focus', 'dynamics', 'nine', 'people', 'shelter', 'external', 'influence', 'only', 'two', 'small', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'doses.The', 'name', 'movie', 'apropos', 'several', 'levels', 'obvious', 'divide', 'world', 'world', 'shelter', 'multiple', 'divides', 'occur', 'group', 'morphs', 'course', 'movie', 'divide', 'viewers', 'film', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'people', 'trying', 'survive', 'nearly', 'unthinkable', 'circumstances', 'gratuitous', 'top', 'many', 'ways.This', 'movie', 'grim', 'dark', 'dank', 'experiment', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'put', 'box', 'audience', 'watch', 'humanity', 'dissolve', 'are', 'power', 'struggles', 'control', 'resources', 'trust', 'issues', 'alliances', 'formed', 'broken', 'continuous', 'erosion', 'sense', 'civility', 'start', 'finish', 'film', 'story', 'choices-how', 'far', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'what', 'depths', 'are', 'willing', 'sink', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'survive', 'maintain', 'control', 'punches', 'showing', 'dark', 'ugly', 'side', 'what', 'have', 'potential', 'becoming', 'nightmarish', 'conditions.The', 'Divide', 'mixed', 'bag', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'bought', 'Roseanna', 'Arquette', 'character', 'rapid', 'transformation', 'loving', 'mother', 'willing', 'rape', 'victim', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'stretch', 'as', 'far', 'believability', 'especially', 'tale', 'progressed', 'was', 'somewhat', 'confused', 'soldiers', 'why', 'was', 'necessary', 'bring', 'story-they', 'could', 'have', 'not', 'shown', 'up', 'tale', 'would', 'have', 'progressed', 'just', 'fine', 'most', 'part', 'also', 'felt', 'two', 'hours', 'run', 'time', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'sliced', 'out', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'still', 'presented', 'same', 'tale-it', 'seemed', 'drag', 'places', 'Even', 'complaints', 'movie', 'drew', 'kept', 'interested', 'characters', 'warped', 'being', 'normal', 'people', 'survivors', 'buried', 'deep', 'hole', 'knowing', 'will', 'never', 'break', 'free', 'prison', ""'re"", 'not', 'film', 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'urge', 'watch', 'again', 'will', 'remember', 'long', 'time', 'come']","Divide, The"

None of us should expect laid back acting or mild mannered situations like sitting around and playing chess games all day.  Horror builds up the level of fear with the goal of performing an unexpected event later.Zombie films are mild in nature compared to the situations presented in this film which involves real conscious humans obsessed with themselves in a life or death situation.  The plot of this film, forces me to give it a high rating because it certainly does not play out like any other film of this genre.  The number of unexpected events, that still do not cross the unspoken plausible technology barrier, make it a joy to watch again while thinking of what else could have happened in this film filled with undiscovered plot lines.Michael Biehn plays the part of a building superintendent who thinks the basement is his domain.  He does a good job of grasping the psychological twists that his character must endure during The Divide.  His success in this role was affected by the other actors in the film which lead to my 3 star rating.Lauren German plays the role of Eva in this film, The Divide.  She played her role very well with deep long stares and uplifting confidence.The Divide was my first chance to see Courtney Vance perform in a major role.  He has a lot of potential which could make this movie be watched more in the future.The other actors did a less than notable job and one of them is my least favorite.  You can only do so much to avoid his movies today.The cinematography in this film was very good for the low light conditions.  Since the movie is shot in a bunker, you are left with few places to film due to the vast area without lighting.In conclusion, The Divide UNRATED presented by Anchor Bay Films is actually an entertaining film best suited for a lazy Sunday afternoon.  The acting was sub-par for the emotion required by the story but that was only due to inexperience.  Horror and Sci-Fi fans should appreciate something in The Divide.

Divisive, those, indeed. And for the first one hundred seven minutes of this one hundred twelve minute movie, I was spending a bit of brainpower crafting impassioned responses to a number of those comments, defending these characters and their behavior, with illustrations from history (anyone who believes that humans wouldn't descend to the level of savages given an impending apocalypse needs to bone up on the last century).And then came the last two sequences in the movie, and what I can only describe as the [censored for Amazon consumption] move to end all [censored for Amazon consumption] moves. It's a complete one-eighty for the character involved, it's absolutely senseless within the universe the movie has built, and it reminded me all too painfully of just why it is I can't stand Xavier Gens (&lt;em>Frontier(s)&lt;/em>). I am unfamiliar with the screenwriting team of Mueller and Sheean (this was their first work), but given the rest of the film, I am totally willing to place the blame for that ending solely on Gens' head. (Because, you know, Hollywood NEVER reshoots endings.)Plot: nine residents of an apartment building in New York City flee to the basement during an attack that (as far as we can tell) levels the city. Whether it is a nuclear attack or not is ireelevant, really; Mickey (&lt;em>Terminator&lt;/em>'s Michael Biehn), the somewhat cracked urban-survivalist building super, is convinced it is, and seals them into his basement shelter. We'd be getting into spoiler territory if I told you what happens next, but let's say that after a handful of traumatic events, the survivors' psyches begin to be stripped down to their basest elements. If you were paying attention in the first bit, there should only be minor surprises for you (one character seems a touch more noble than you'd think he'd be, for example); the pleasure, if one can call it that, in watching this movie unfold is in seeing just how absurd the personality devolvement will become. (Here's a hint: it's a Xavier Gens movie.)And while it relies just a little too much on stereotypes--the aggressive African-American man who is finally out from under the boot of white authority pitted against the redneck brothers, the stable, well-adjusted guy is a wimp unable to stand up for his girlfriend, blah blah blah, I was willing to forgive the movie all this because Mueller and Sheean were dancing around as much as they could within those stereotypes, giving us realistic, complex characters that might actually have you questioning whether they're stereotypes at all. That takes some doing, a lot of sitting around the table talking about what these characters would do, a lot of backstory, and not a little subtlety, and for the most part it works... right up until those final two sequences. Which will likely make you want to go to New York, brave the allegedly-radioactive dust, and kill everyone involved.In other words: worth watching, but prepare yourself for a letdown. **",2,So good right up until...,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,3201,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Divide', 'lt', '>', 'Xavier', 'Gens', '2011', 'Full', 'disclosure', 'movie', 'was', 'proided', 'free', 'charge', 'Amazon', 'Vine.While', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'perusing', 'comments', 'IMDB', 'message', 'boards', 'Divisive', 'indeed', 'first', 'one', 'hundred', 'seven', 'minutes', 'one', 'hundred', 'twelve', 'minute', 'movie', 'was', 'spending', 'bit', 'brainpower', 'crafting', 'impassioned', 'responses', 'number', 'comments', 'defending', 'characters', 'behavior', 'illustrations', 'history', 'anyone', 'who', 'humans', 'would', ""n't"", 'descend', 'level', 'savages', 'given', 'impending', 'apocalypse', 'needs', 'bone', 'up', 'last', 'century', '.And', 'then', 'came', 'last', 'two', 'sequences', 'movie', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'describe', '[', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'move', 'end', '[', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'complete', 'one-eighty', 'character', 'involved', 'absolutely', 'senseless', 'universe', 'movie', 'built', 'reminded', 'too', 'painfully', 'just', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Xavier', 'Gens', 'lt', '>', 'Frontier', 's', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'am', 'unfamiliar', 'screenwriting', 'team', 'Mueller', 'Sheean', 'was', 'first', 'work', 'given', 'rest', 'film', 'am', 'totally', 'willing', 'place', 'blame', 'ending', 'solely', 'Gens', 'head', 'know', 'Hollywood', 'NEVER', 'reshoots', 'endings', 'Plot', 'nine', 'residents', 'apartment', 'building', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'flee', 'basement', 'attack', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'levels', 'city', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'not', 'ireelevant', 'really', 'Mickey', 'lt', '>', 'Terminator', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'somewhat', 'cracked', 'urban-survivalist', 'building', 'super', 'convinced', 'seals', 'basement', 'shelter', ""'d"", 'be', 'getting', 'spoiler', 'territory', 'told', 'what', 'next', 'let', 'say', 'handful', 'traumatic', 'events', 'survivors', 'psyches', 'begin', 'be', 'stripped', 'down', 'basest', 'elements', 'were', 'paying', 'attention', 'first', 'bit', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'minor', 'surprises', 'one', 'character', 'touch', 'more', 'noble', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'example', 'pleasure', 'one', 'can', 'call', 'watching', 'movie', 'unfold', 'seeing', 'just', 'how', 'absurd', 'personality', 'devolvement', 'will', 'become', 'Here', 'hint', 'Xavier', 'Gens', 'movie', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'stereotypes', 'aggressive', 'African-American', 'man', 'who', 'finally', 'boot', 'white', 'authority', 'pitted', 'redneck', 'brothers', 'stable', 'well-adjusted', 'guy', 'wimp', 'unable', 'stand', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'was', 'willing', 'forgive', 'movie', 'Mueller', 'Sheean', 'were', 'dancing', 'around', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'stereotypes', 'giving', 'realistic', 'complex', 'characters', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'questioning', ""'re"", 'stereotypes', 'doing', 'lot', 'sitting', 'table', 'talking', 'what', 'characters', 'would', 'do', 'lot', 'backstory', 'not', 'little', 'subtlety', 'most', 'part', 'right', 'final', 'two', 'sequences', 'will', 'likely', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'New', 'York', 'brave', 'allegedly-radioactive', 'dust', 'kill', 'everyone', 'involved.In', 'other', 'words', 'worth', 'watching', 'prepare', 'letdown', '**']","Divide, The"

Unfortunately, the vision that Gens had his cast acting out was a very pessimistic view of human emotion and behavior. So while the acting and direction were really good, the plot was so over the top with such unbelievable scenarios that it made the movie one of the worst I've seen all year.Nuclear bombs are raining down on The City, and you hastily make your way down from your apartment flat to the basement of your complex. You arrive at the basement door just in time to stop the building super from locking himself into a shelter and you out. You make it into the shelter with about 7 or 8 other building tenants. And...you would have been better off letting the bombs get you. Because it turns out that the other people who were neighboring with you in the building are mostly insane, irrational and incapable of a decent moral thought.What's that mean? Well just ask yourself: Would you like to be locked in a small shelter indefinitely in a group of almost a dozen with even just one person that was mostly insane, irrational and incapable of a decent moral thought? Let the inhumanities begin: Murder, torture, rape, mindless cruelty...just awful. Like an apocalypticHostel. Then to top it all off, during about mid-movie we learn that some sophisticated military lab has been built above the basement (When? How? What!!!) in place of the nuclear bomb devastated apartment building, and the military unit running the lab are as hostile (no pun intended) as some of the nuts inside the shelter.I will say that the decent acting and the suspense of what crazy, atrocity would happen next kept me watching. As I said earlier, the cast took their parts very seriously. But, I mean, for a small room of people to resort to a such violent,Mad Maxdictatorship from practically the first shout of ""action"" by Director Gens was beyond extreme and completely unbelievable to me.

I feel like maybe I watched a different film then them did.Polarizing: I really don't know what was polarizing about this movie. If you're saying you either like it or you don't... sure, but that's pretty much every movie. I actually found myself as middle ground about this movie as I've ever been, and I usually have a strong opinion one way or the other. Polarizing would be maybe... Idk something that divides people on a deep philosophical basis. This definitely won't be doing that.Realistic: No. Just no. This movie has no real thought for attention to detail, although I do feel like the portrayal of how people would start to turn ugly in a similar circumstance was well done and quite believable, and that's obviously the most important detail they needed to hit, and they certainly did. That being said, I found myself really distracted by so many little details that shouldn't have been glossed over, and the really ill-timed bad acting and script. I found myself thinking about bed-sores for half the movie (if you've seen this movie and you know what bed-sores are you probably know why).Intense: sure... it was intense. Sorta. Its really hard to get into a movie where you have almost no connection with the characters. The character development in this film sucks. The acting is spotty at key moments, although one of the guys does a fabulous job and overall the acting is decent. Another problem with this film that keeps it from truly being intense is *semi-spoiler alert* the hazmat guys. That was such a stupid section it totally had me checking out for the rest of the movie. Maybe someone somewhere thought that was a reasonable situation that made any kind of sense... no.Over all I sorta enjoyed this movie. I wouldn't watch it again probably, but it wasn't an unpleasant experience really. I feel like this movie is a great concept but was trivialized by the directors idea for the end.

As the point of view shifts we see nuclear explosions erupting all over the city.  I love me a good end of the world movie and Xavier Gens had me on the edge of my seat from the opening scene to the very end so I didn't wonder out loud why our heroine didn't go blind as she was looking directly at the blast.  This movie is a really fun ride in spite of its flaws.The action starts with the panicked residents fleeing their apartments and further explosions as they're trying to escape which sends 8 to the basement where the super, Mickey, lives and where the nightmare unfolds.  Luckily for everyone Mickey is a bit psycho and has been planning for such an event in the years since 9-11 so he just happens to have a lot of food and weapons stockpiled.  Smoke `em if you got `em because it's going to be a long few weeks.  A lot of smoking takes place.This could now go in a variety of directions.  ""The Road"" comes to mind; who will be the first to be dinner when the food ultimately does run out?  It's definitely not the special effects laden ""The Day After"" nor is it the solemn humanity and quiet death of ""On the Beach.""  Nope, it's a psycho-sexual horror movie as satisfying as any even if by the climatic end you realize you've been had.As tempers begin to fray they can hear the building collapse on top of them and after a brief silence and a knock on their door, followed by banging , we see a torch welder cutting  through the steel door.What comes through the door is a small group wearing hazmat suits.  A child is dragged from its mother's arms, something is squirted into her mouth and an injection with a hypodermic the size of a baseball bat goes into her neck.  She is loaded, screaming and crying into a body bag and removed.  Then the troopers go after the survivors who fight back.  Our survivors take out the two remaining storm troopers and tend to their wounded.Wearing one of the hazmat suits one of the survivors opens the door and goes into the unknown.  He walks out not onto streets of destruction but into a biohazard like tunnel system made of hazmat  plastic.  Our survivor continues until he finds a lab and sees the children, shaved heads and eyebrows, taped eyes and tubes in their mouths.  Each are in their own stasis module.  A fight ensues with some of the troopers who discover he's an imposter and he takes them out and retreats back to the basement shelter.  We see the arc welders again at the door and someone screams ""They're coming back!""  Mickey says , ""No.  They're welding us in.""  This is high concept apocalypse after all.Sharp, tight dialogue and a clever script keep us on edge as their options, patience, sanity and humanity run out faster than their food supplies as it is discovered Mickey has been keeping hidden his stash of food.  This plot point keeps them alive as they descend further into the depths of depravity.  After an hour and a half of madness our heroine is all that's left and she dons a hazmat suit, and descends into the septic tank where she finds another way out and climbs up covered in poo into a dead world.And that's the problem.  Where are the hazmat guys and where and why and what was all that about.  Apparently it was a story arc that went nowhere and was just a gimmick to get a hazmat suit in the shelter so she could escape without ruining her pumps in poo water.  But really?  Compared to the disappointment of not having that story arc resolved it would seem that a better script would have had her make her way through the waist deep poo water without protection.  Her climbing up into a dead city would have created a stronger scene, put a period on that sentence and would have not left those of us with enough brain cells working to figure out that the whole hazmat deal was a gimmick to get that hazmat suit down there for her to use.  Considering how psycho Mickey was it wouldn't have been surprising were he to have one stashed there as well so that whole story arc seemed unnecessary.None of this means the ride isn't a whole lot of fun and you can see the actors digging deep to perform their psychotic dance but you feel a little cheated because you really want to know who the hazmat guys were and what they were doing and that doesn't happen",4,A Great Ride In Spite Of Its Flaws,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,4387,"['music', 'open', 'close-up', 'tear', 'being', 'birthed', 'eye', 'see', 'reflection', 'missiles', 'falling', 'Manhattan', 'point', 'view', 'shifts', 'see', 'nuclear', 'explosions', 'erupting', 'city', 'love', 'good', 'end', 'world', 'movie', 'Xavier', 'Gens', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'opening', 'scene', 'very', 'end', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'wonder', 'out', 'loud', 'why', 'heroine', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'blind', 'was', 'looking', 'directly', 'blast', 'movie', 'really', 'fun', 'ride', 'spite', 'flaws.The', 'action', 'panicked', 'residents', 'fleeing', 'apartments', 'further', 'explosions', ""'re"", 'trying', 'escape', '8', 'basement', 'where', 'super', 'Mickey', 'where', 'nightmare', 'Luckily', 'everyone', 'Mickey', 'bit', 'psycho', 'been', 'planning', 'event', 'years', '9-11', 'just', 'have', 'lot', 'food', 'weapons', 'stockpiled', 'Smoke', 'em', 'got', 'em', 'going', 'be', 'long', 'few', 'weeks', 'lot', 'smoking', 'place.This', 'could', 'now', 'go', 'variety', 'directions', 'Road', 'mind', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'be', 'dinner', 'when', 'food', 'ultimately', 'run', 'out', 'definitely', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'laden', 'Day', 'solemn', 'humanity', 'quiet', 'death', 'Beach', 'Nope', 'psycho-sexual', 'horror', 'movie', 'as', 'satisfying', 'even', 'climatic', 'end', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had.As', 'tempers', 'begin', 'fray', 'can', 'hear', 'building', 'collapse', 'top', 'brief', 'silence', 'knock', 'door', 'followed', 'banging', 'see', 'torch', 'welder', 'cutting', 'steel', 'door.What', 'door', 'small', 'group', 'wearing', 'hazmat', 'suits', 'child', 'dragged', 'mother', 'arms', 'something', 'squirted', 'mouth', 'injection', 'hypodermic', 'size', 'baseball', 'bat', 'neck', 'loaded', 'screaming', 'crying', 'body', 'bag', 'removed', 'Then', 'troopers', 'go', 'survivors', 'who', 'fight', 'back', 'survivors', 'take', 'out', 'two', 'remaining', 'storm', 'troopers', 'tend', 'wounded.Wearing', 'one', 'hazmat', 'suits', 'one', 'survivors', 'door', 'unknown', 'out', 'not', 'streets', 'destruction', 'biohazard', 'tunnel', 'system', 'made', 'hazmat', 'plastic', 'survivor', 'lab', 'children', 'shaved', 'heads', 'eyebrows', 'taped', 'eyes', 'tubes', 'mouths', 'are', 'own', 'stasis', 'module', 'fight', 'troopers', 'who', 'discover', 'imposter', 'out', 'retreats', 'back', 'basement', 'shelter', 'see', 'arc', 'welders', 'again', 'door', 'someone', 'screams', ""'re"", 'coming', 'back', 'Mickey', 'No', ""'re"", 'welding', 'high', 'concept', 'apocalypse', 'all.Sharp', 'tight', 'dialogue', 'clever', 'script', 'keep', 'edge', 'options', 'patience', 'sanity', 'humanity', 'run', 'out', 'faster', 'food', 'supplies', 'discovered', 'Mickey', 'been', 'keeping', 'hidden', 'stash', 'food', 'plot', 'point', 'alive', 'descend', 'further', 'depths', 'depravity', 'hour', 'half', 'madness', 'heroine', 'left', 'hazmat', 'suit', 'septic', 'tank', 'where', 'way', 'climbs', 'up', 'covered', 'poo', 'dead', 'world.And', 'problem', 'Where', 'are', 'hazmat', 'guys', 'where', 'why', 'what', 'was', 'Apparently', 'was', 'story', 'arc', 'went', 'nowhere', 'was', 'just', 'gimmick', 'get', 'hazmat', 'suit', 'shelter', 'could', 'escape', 'ruining', 'pumps', 'poo', 'water', 'really', 'Compared', 'disappointment', 'not', 'having', 'story', 'arc', 'resolved', 'would', 'seem', 'better', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'make', 'way', 'waist', 'deep', 'poo', 'water', 'protection', 'climbing', 'up', 'dead', 'city', 'would', 'have', 'created', 'stronger', 'scene', 'put', 'period', 'sentence', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'left', 'enough', 'brain', 'cells', 'working', 'figure', 'out', 'whole', 'hazmat', 'deal', 'was', 'gimmick', 'get', 'hazmat', 'suit', 'there', 'use', 'Considering', 'how', 'psycho', 'Mickey', 'was', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'surprising', 'were', 'have', 'one', 'stashed', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'story', 'arc', 'seemed', 'unnecessary.None', 'ride', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'can', 'see', 'actors', 'digging', 'deep', 'perform', 'psychotic', 'dance', 'feel', 'little', 'cheated', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'who', 'hazmat', 'guys', 'were', 'what', 'were', 'doing', ""n't"", 'happen']","Divide, The"

The themes portrayed here are dark and evil and this is a stark look at humanity and the decent into madness that isolation and fear can induce.  Also I find that the involvement of ""higher and more organized survivors"" interacting with the group adds to the sense of dread and ultimate dissolution of sanity.  The use of cinematography to capture the emotion of these events adds a very real and foreboding setting.  Once the world is viewed it is desolate and dark and reminder of the consequence of war.The story begins with explosions (obviously nuclear) seen outside of an office window stories up in an apartment building.  As chaos errupts people make there way down stairs to the ground but some groups seek out the underground basement as a place to hide and regroup.  The Super of the building is a survivalist and has been preparing for the end of the world for many years.  A former military man and firefighter in 9-11 he is no stranger to surviving difficult and seemingly impossible situations.  Yet as we learn his wife and daughter perish in a fire themselves.  He is hard and impassionate.  Yet despite all of this he allows the 10 or so people to pile into the basement storage areas of the building. There is so many stress elements to deal with for everyone involved as the story continues but here are a couple of the highlights.  They can't let anyone in or out of the basements primary entrance due to the fear of radiation and dust.  There are load banging noises constantly as the building itself collapses and the sounds of other destruction continues long after the initial barrage.  In short,  the psychological strain is great and it plays against each character in varying ways.Ultimately we learn that the risks outside are as great as the risks of those inside.  Who are these survivors and will they maintain sanity or slowly slide into the abyss of madness.  This concept is played over and over and things get only worse as time passes.  I don't wish to give any more away.  We know that the world around them is in ruin but the reality of their situation is too much for them to mentally grasp and as the tension builds so does the danger and despair.  The walls of humanity shake and crumble and the images will haunt you long after the last scene.We know what is happening and yet the story continues to suck you in.  The character interaction is strong and the acting was very good.  The cinemetography was striking.  This is a powerful story with even more memorable images. I highly reccomend this movie as it was the most realistic I have seen dealing with the aftermath of nuclear warfare.  Why did all of this happen?  Do we ever really know?  If the world did end and you found yourself in that basement how would you know what was really happening or when it was safe to go outside?  How would the government deal with it and would they be helpful or the opposite?Great movie.

Tonight's very small exercise in logic from the Twilight Zone.""Whenever I see a bomb shelter movie, I always think about this ""Twilight Zone"" episode. It is the one where there is limited room in a bomb shelter as a Civil Defense announcement is made. The neighbors turn violent. Likewise in this film, it is the examination of people's character. Plot continuity is unimportant to the film. As a side note, notice the importance of plastic sheeting and duct tape during a terrorist attack.The action starts from the opening clip. No time for character build-up. The reason why there is no character build-up is that the people represent different aspects of society/human psyche. Mickey, (Michael Biehn) the super of a NYC apartment building has made a shelter in the basement...for himself. He ends up with a group of tenets which he resents and they likewise despise his cigar smoking rough ways. While he is hard-nosed, he looks out for everyone's safety. He won't win any congeniality contests.The tenets get on each others nerves. Some question Mickey's sanity. Things turn weird as there are outsiders of unknown origin. The film contains some realistic and horrific scenes of killing, torture, dismemberment, menstruation blood, and rape. It examines our core psyche and how it relates to our society: The desire for power and control among men, the competition of age and youth in women for suitors, and the many uses of duct tape. The bunker is a microcosm of society that starts out on equal footing and evolves into a ""haves"" vs. ""have nots"".

I liked that it showed a situation I had never seen before and I am glad I watched it. However, I would not put myself through that 2 hour, soul crushing hopelessness again.I thought a lot of it was unrealistic. For instance, a basement is not indestructible and it's not air tight. Radiation would have gotten in regardless. The people were unbelievable as well. I don't think people would just sit by and let women get raped or let random people decide who lives and who dies. And if they do, then they deserve their fate. Nothing really put those 2 depraved men above anyone else except that they were strong enough to take control. I also don't understand why a gun was so important. There were plenty of other blunt objects and even an ax that would have done the same thing: threaten or kill the 2 men that took control.

Several residents of an apartment building force their way into their building's basement, which has actually been made into a survival bunker by the building's superintendent (played by Michael Biehn).  Also Included in the band of survivors is a mother (Rosanna Arquette) and her young daughter, a couple, and several twenty-something men and one older guy.  Early on, the movie's riveting moment is when some unidentified soldiers in hazmat suits break into the bunker for a very specific purpose (which I won't reveal here, as it'd be a spoiler).  Over the course of the movie, or rather, mostly the first half, there are some genuinely suspense-building moments, but the issue I had with the film was that the second half turned somewhat bizarre, as it continually upped the ante of cringe-inducing violence and some very disturbing sexual happenings (spoilers which I also won't get into), once the characters start to turn on one another and torment each other.  I'm not sure if the point of the film was that given desperate circumstances, people will devolve into depraved behavior - it struck me as a mix of ""Lord of the Flies"" combined with the Twilight Zone epi called ""The Shelter"" filtered thru a ""Saw"" sensibility (as well as the claustrophobic set of ""Saw"" itself).  It's pretty gory at points and definitely NOT for the squeamish, and some elements of the plot are never fully resolved (you'll know what I mean if you choose to watch it).  Production values seem pretty good for the scale of the movie - I get the feeling this didn't have a huge budget but the filmmakers probably didn't need a lot, given that most of the action takes place in the basement, and the film looks good for what it is trying to do.  The cast is overall pretty good (I'd say it's a B-minus/C-list cast of people who've mostly done recent TV work, outside of Biehn and Arquette, who have been in plenty of films).  Biehn and Arquette sometimes overact here, practically chewing scenery, but I also thought that Lauren German, as Eva, was quite good - I was unfamiliar with her work before.

The film starts out as a post-apocalyptic thriller about a small group of survivors after a nuke attack on New York City; it also intends to be a psychological drama of these ""lucky"" people under the claustrophobic situations. The premise may remind us of Vincenzo Natali's psychological thriller ""Cube,"" in which scientific elements serve as a set-up for the story about the characters trapped in a small space.The idea is good, if not very original. Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to develop it into a compelling narrative. ""The Divide"" tries to be a grim, uncompromising thriller by repeatedly using graphic violence. Though I do not disagree with the idea itself, I still find it annoying and pointless when violence is the only thing the director seems interested in.What is strange about ""The Divide"" is that no one in the film (and the filmmakers) seems to care the details of the situation. The film seems unaware of such things as water, air ventilation and radioactive matters that will affect the lives of the characters. The director seems only interested in how those survivors descend into a hellish condition, being deprived of last vestige of humanity.By the time the film's thin story comes to the conclusion, I stopped caring what is going on inside of the basement, even though the film has a decent cast including Rosanna Arquette, Michael Biehn, Lauren German, Courtney B.

1526653,A4OSXRZR2BMX8,B007549W62,"William Merrill ""eclecticist""","[1, 3]","(3 & 1/2 stars)After some kind of nuclear attack hits NYC, a limited number of survivors from an apartment building are able to escape into a basement fallout shelter built by the building super, Mickey, played by Michael Biehn of Terminator and Aliens fame.  The shelter dwellers cannot leave their underground location when circumstances isolate them underground. What follows in this Canadian film, The Divide, is a descent into chaos and madness, with the group members forming uneasy alliances as they fight for power and available resources.  In some cases, the worst sort of subhuman behavior begins to manifest itself in the absence of any rule of law.  More than a post-apocalyptic tale, this is a study of human nature deteriorating within a closed system, following in the long tradition of such stories, from Lord of the Flies on.  The cast also includes Rosanna Arquette, Milo Ventimiglia (Heroes), Courtney B. Vance, and other actors who are less well known.  The part of the Milla-Jo-esque ""tough beauty"" is played by Lauren German, who somehow succumbs to the radiation sickness much more slowly than the rest of the survivors, I guess so she could remain pretty-looking for a longer time.There were elements in The Divide I liked, such as the brief and mysterious intervention of a quasi-military HAZMAT team, and the acting was strong throughout the movie.  But it was too long (over two hours, felt like at least two and a half).  Also the degradation was sometimes fascinating (ex., the devolution of Josh & Bobby, a couple of buddies who give in to every evil impulse that comes along), but otherwise hard to watch, especially what happens to Ms Arquette's character.  Overall, though, the idea and story were interesting enough for me to give this flick a mild recommendation.",3,"Humans behaving badly, after the apocalypse",1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,1798,"['3', '1/2', 'stars', 'kind', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'hits', 'NYC', 'limited', 'number', 'survivors', 'apartment', 'building', 'are', 'able', 'escape', 'basement', 'fallout', 'shelter', 'built', 'building', 'super', 'Mickey', 'played', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'Terminator', 'Aliens', 'fame', 'shelter', 'dwellers', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'underground', 'location', 'when', 'circumstances', 'isolate', 'underground', 'What', 'Canadian', 'film', 'Divide', 'descent', 'chaos', 'madness', 'group', 'members', 'forming', 'uneasy', 'alliances', 'fight', 'power', 'available', 'resources', 'cases', 'worst', 'sort', 'subhuman', 'behavior', 'manifest', 'absence', 'rule', 'law', 'More', 'post-apocalyptic', 'tale', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'deteriorating', 'closed', 'system', 'following', 'long', 'tradition', 'such', 'stories', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'cast', 'also', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'Milo', 'Ventimiglia', 'Heroes', 'Courtney', 'B.', 'Vance', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'part', 'Milla-Jo-esque', 'tough', 'beauty', 'played', 'Lauren', 'German', 'who', 'somehow', 'succumbs', 'radiation', 'sickness', 'much', 'more', 'slowly', 'rest', 'survivors', 'guess', 'so', 'could', 'remain', 'pretty-looking', 'longer', 'were', 'elements', 'Divide', 'liked', 'such', 'brief', 'mysterious', 'intervention', 'quasi-military', 'HAZMAT', 'team', 'acting', 'was', 'strong', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'two', 'hours', 'felt', 'least', 'two', 'half', 'Also', 'degradation', 'was', 'sometimes', 'fascinating', 'ex.', 'devolution', 'Josh', 'Bobby', 'couple', 'buddies', 'who', 'give', 'evil', 'impulse', 'along', 'otherwise', 'hard', 'watch', 'especially', 'what', 'Ms', 'Arquette', 'character', 'Overall', 'though', 'idea', 'story', 'were', 'interesting', 'enough', 'give', 'flick', 'mild', 'recommendation']","Divide, The"

1526655,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B007549W62,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[2, 4]","The horror of a nuclear holocaust is one of the things that horrifies every one of us. I know, most of us are afraid of the actual explosion, while some are afraid of the nuclear fall out that fallows (photos of the Japanese people stricken with radiation sickness is indeed horrifying) and most of us wonder how we are going to cope if indeed the world falls under a nuclear holocaust. Well, director Xavier Gens' ""The Divide"" attempts to take a look at what can happen to a group of survivors if such an attack does happen. His vision is not very pretty, and really, the film is a little hard to sit through.The film begins during a nuclear assault on New York as seen through the eyes of Eva (Lauren German). Eva alongside a number of the apartment's tenants manage to join the `survivalist super' of the building, Mickey (Michael Biehn) into the basement-made up fall out shelter where he has stocked piled some food and water. Days past, and the folks begin to crack, panic and then remain or turn into what we can call like ""stock characters"" in a scenario like this-there is the guy who turns psycho (Milo Ventimiglia), the sensitive geek (Ashton Holmes), the imbalanced one (Michael Eklund), the mother (Rosanna Arquette), the French guy (Ivan Gonzales) and there is the shaky one (Courtney B. Vance). You know exactly where the film is headed--imagine a pressure cooker where different personalities and paranoia come together too close for comfort....I guess the way to describe the themes tossed around by writers Karl Mueller and Eron Sheean are the likes of what we've seen in ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"". There is something to be said for a little ambiguity and maybe restraint that can make such themes work. The trick is having a build up that makes the characters grow within the viewers' perspective, and add a little more drama with powerful dialogue to get its points across. There is a commentary here that is all about human behavior and rather than doing it in a subtle, methodical manner, Gens opts to put everything in your face.I know, what we see in ""The Divide"" is possible, but for some reason, finding different layers and dimensions in the script becomes such a chore because of the way the film is executed. Not really sure why, I know most of the characters are supposed to be something that was truly meant to be despised and their behavior is excruciating to watch. But I am not sure, I felt that the characters were empty and a little too exaggerated. Yeah, the direction did have some points where it seemed to display a credible character shift (example Eklund's scene to chop a dead body up and German's strong-willed realization of the desperate situation), but by then, most of the film has already been hampered by too much cartoonish interaction that all appears to be heavy-handed and perfunctory.The film is violent, however, I have to say that because of the way it was structured, some scenes become a little `funny'. Josh and Bobby are genre characters and despite their scenes of depraved behavior, I find them quite ineffective and a little dull. Most of the other characters are either tortured physically and mentally but none was more humiliated as Rosanna Arquette's character Marilyn, as I could not believe the lengths of humiliation the actress exposed herself to. I mean, having a menstrual scene and a duct tape bra while being sexually abused should be unnerving, what is more sickening is what the character's state of mind would be to allow such things to happen to her. German is the strong-willed female who maintains her cool and she serves her part well; but frankly, the other characters such as Adrien and Sam feel like minor fillers because they were underutilized.The direction by Gens have that dirty and grainy atmosphere to add a gritty feel around his shots. I also saw some Sam Raimi-inspired camerawork that looked kind of cool. I did feel that the direction relied on visuals and in trying to make things over-the-top, rather than developing the roots and core of the narrative. The film feels like it is all about looks and visual and aural manipulation--no ambiguity at all, it is as straight-forward as one can get. I guess while I appreciated the ambitions behind ""The Divide"", and admittedly, the first half of the film captured a solid sense of discomfort and paranoia among its characters. I questioned its shifts, and maybe it tried a little too hard, and then pulled itself back. There is a good film in ""The Divide"", but it comes up a little short.RENTAL [2  Out of 5 Stars]The movie was intentionally shot with a lot of grain and dirt, so the dvd transfer is nothing special.
