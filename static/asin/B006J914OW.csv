Brice ""blackwoodalgernon""","[3, 4]","The only reason I stuck with this movie to the end was that I had a hard day, and didn't have the energy to stop it.  The film was shot in the Czech Republic, and contained some beautiful and exotic scenery. It was apparently shot for an American audience because everyone spoke English with a heavy accent, and even the books and writing were in English. The plot was difficult to follow for me, maybe because I was bored by the incredibly slow pace and uninteresting script...I kept finding my attention drifting away.  Another reason I stuck with the movie was that I found the main actress, Milena Minichova, smoking hot. I know, I hang my head in shame.  I didn't really get the ending, but it was a surprise. The only really interesting scenes were between the heroine and the crazy homeless guy she'd run into in the park.  The ""horror"" element was so mild that I had to crank up my volume so it would startle me.  No real horror here, just a spooky ghost that pops up now and then.  The dead sister element was never explained, at least I didn't get it.

I give it two stars only, because the acting, really, could have been better. Although I'm not familiar with the actors, I have seen czech films with much, much better acting. True this was either dubbed or the actors speaking english themselves, I had no problems with the language but perhaps if it was spoken in their language and subtittled in english, the acting could have had more quality, I don't know, or maybe the acting IS bad. Also, I expected a little more suspense and to have more action with the spirits. A bit of a slow movie but not entirely bad.

1516213,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B006J914OW,Ron,"[4, 5]","Dark Spirits is a ghost/horror story set in Prague involving two rival sibling sisters one of whom is murdered. The surviving sister is suffering from guilt for not coming to the aid of her now dead sister. She is also plagued with nightmares and visions of her sister and her possible murderer.Everyone she comes in contact with will suffer from thses same traumas including her boyfriend, neighbor and the cop investigating the murder.That is the basic storyline for the movie that takes the viewer slowly down many different paths that leaves the surviving sister scared and confused as well as the viewer.The story touches on several different possibilities for what happened to the sister and what is happening to the surviving sister and the people she comes in contact with. The multi directional paths the story takes is what hurts this movie and leaves so many wondering what happened here and why and who are these people that are causing all of this chaos. At times I think even the director and the writer got a little lost or confused telling the story. I do not know how experienced the director was, so I don't know if they overextended thmselves trying to tell this very difficult to produce story or not. These multi directional stories are hard to get right and to have them coalesces into a coherent story.On the plus side of this movie, we have an attractive cast that do a decent job of acting with some exceptions. Their english is clear and understandable except for a few occasions when I had to replay the conversations. Some of the location cinematography is beautifully shot as well some of the scenes of cast interaction.The combining of the beautiful cinematography and the attractive cast and interesting albeit confusing story made this movie worth the time to watch.The movie doesn't have a lot of violent scenes and most is left to the viewers imagination and the same can be said for the sex scenes that are void of nudity. There is very little cursing if any at all. As far as gore is concerned there isn't really any except for some blood. The special effects are almost non existent and the special effects makeup is also limited with ok results.This can/is a confusing and slow paced story that's hard to follow at times that is very well shot throughout most of the movie that does come together somewhat at the end if you are paying attention throughout the movie. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE if you are looking for a mindless fast pacing, sex/nudity, gore and violence in your movie. 3 Very cautious stars.",3,MULTI-TASKING,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,2543,"['Dark', 'Spirits', 'ghost/horror', 'story', 'set', 'Prague', 'involving', 'two', 'rival', 'sibling', 'sisters', 'one', 'whom', 'murdered', 'surviving', 'sister', 'suffering', 'guilt', 'not', 'coming', 'aid', 'now', 'dead', 'sister', 'also', 'plagued', 'nightmares', 'visions', 'sister', 'possible', 'murderer.Everyone', 'contact', 'will', 'suffer', 'thses', 'same', 'including', 'boyfriend', 'neighbor', 'cop', 'investigating', 'murder.That', 'basic', 'storyline', 'movie', 'viewer', 'slowly', 'down', 'many', 'different', 'paths', 'surviving', 'sister', 'scared', 'confused', 'as', 'well', 'viewer.The', 'story', 'touches', 'several', 'different', 'possibilities', 'what', 'happened', 'sister', 'what', 'happening', 'surviving', 'sister', 'people', 'contact', 'multi', 'directional', 'paths', 'story', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'why', 'who', 'are', 'people', 'are', 'causing', 'chaos', 'times', 'think', 'even', 'director', 'writer', 'got', 'little', 'lost', 'confused', 'telling', 'story', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'experienced', 'director', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'overextended', 'thmselves', 'trying', 'tell', 'very', 'difficult', 'produce', 'story', 'not', 'multi', 'directional', 'stories', 'are', 'hard', 'get', 'right', 'have', 'coalesces', 'coherent', 'story.On', 'plus', 'side', 'movie', 'have', 'attractive', 'cast', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'acting', 'exceptions', 'english', 'clear', 'understandable', 'few', 'occasions', 'when', 'had', 'replay', 'conversations', 'location', 'cinematography', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'cast', 'interaction.The', 'combining', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'attractive', 'cast', 'interesting', 'albeit', 'confusing', 'story', 'made', 'movie', 'time', 'watch.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'violent', 'scenes', 'most', 'left', 'viewers', 'imagination', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'void', 'nudity', 'very', 'little', 'cursing', 'As', 'far', 'gore', 'concerned', ""n't"", 'really', 'except', 'blood', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'almost', 'non', 'existent', 'special', 'effects', 'makeup', 'also', 'limited', 'ok', 'results.This', 'confusing', 'slow', 'paced', 'story', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'very', 'well', 'shot', 'most', 'movie', 'come', 'together', 'somewhat', 'end', 'are', 'paying', 'attention', 'movie', 'DO', 'NOT', 'WATCH', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'are', 'looking', 'mindless', 'fast', 'pacing', 'sex/nudity', 'gore', 'violence', 'movie', '3', 'Very', 'cautious', 'stars']",Dark Spirits

Some may include spoilers but I will avoid it if I can.Lighting needs adjustment on some scenes. There are scenes where I can't even see the actress'/actor's facial expression due to dark insufficient lighting or focus on the face. There are scenes where the camera is too ""shaky"". I guess the cast and film crew are trying to do a first person view but even for a second person view the camera is still juggling around. The lead female character has too much eye liner that it hides away her facial expression when needed. This is I think one of those that I can consider soft-porn; too much kissing, female character wears a bra-less outfit almost every scene where she is at home.SPOILER ALERT!!! There is a bath tub scene where the lead female character had whole body nudity but the torso part the some part of the chest are covered with little bubbles.There is not much of a plot development. The film took several directions but left much unanswered in the film until the ending.SPOILER ALERT!!! The plot seems to revolve around a parallel world and dimension hopping although not much was touched on it.
