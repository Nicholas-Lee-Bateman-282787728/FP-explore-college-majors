It's a shame that people skip these episodes to get to Barnabas. I've gone back and re-watched these and they're much better the 2nd time around. This review will contain spoilers. Vicky has been taken hostage by Matthew Morgan and receives help from Roger and Burke. Burke Devlin is one of my favorite characters because he's so charming, yet conniving. Pretty soon, Laura Collins returns to Collinsport to bring trouble for the Collins family. (Laura is the wife of Roger and mother to David) Laura wants to take David away, but Liz refuses. Meanwhile, Sam Evans begins drawing a grotesque painting of Laura surrounded by fire, but he has no reason why he's painting it. If you love this gothic soap, I highly recommend DARK SHADOWS: THE BEGINNING COLLECTION 4!!!",5,Rise of the Phoenix!!!,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",2014,857,"['beginning', 'episodes', 'were', 'great', 'addicting', 'Filled', 'gothic', 'imagery', 'suspense', 'shame', 'people', 'skip', 'episodes', 'get', 'Barnabas', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'back', 're-watched', ""'re"", 'much', 'better', '2nd', 'time', 'around', 'review', 'will', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Vicky', 'been', 'taken', 'hostage', 'Matthew', 'Morgan', 'receives', 'help', 'Roger', 'Burke', 'Burke', 'Devlin', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'so', 'charming', 'yet', 'conniving', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Laura', 'Collins', 'Collinsport', 'bring', 'trouble', 'Collins', 'family', 'Laura', 'wife', 'Roger', 'mother', 'David', 'Laura', 'take', 'David', 'away', 'Liz', 'Meanwhile', 'Sam', 'Evans', 'drawing', 'grotesque', 'painting', 'Laura', 'surrounded', 'fire', 'reason', 'why', 'painting', 'love', 'gothic', 'soap', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DARK', 'SHADOWS', 'BEGINNING', 'COLLECTION', '4']",N/A

The first couple of Collections are a little slow, but entertaining, especially if you are a Fan. By the time Laura comes on the show, it really starts getting good.  Collection 4 is vintage Dark Shadows and is just as good as the stories after Barnabus.

A year was dedicated to The Beginning before Barnabas Collins ever came on the show. The Beginning Collection 4 has episodes 106-143. There are 4 discs. The first two discs are tying loose ends with Mathew Morgan who kidnaps Victoria and keeps her in the secret room. On Disc 2 episode 123 Laura Collins makes her appearance at the coffee shop. She asks Maggie questions about the Collins family. Disc 3 ties up the Mathew Morgan mystery and Laura comes to Collinwood to take David. This is just her introduction but I am looking forward to seeing more of Laura. Sam Evans is possessed to paint Laura's portrait. She is consumed by fire in the painting and David is with her.(Note:This is Josette Collin's work. She is trying to warn the family about Laura). (Also Laura is supposed to be the phoenix bird of Ancient Egyptian Mythology. As I understand it this series is taking more of the Greek version of The Phoenix Bird. In the Egyptian version the Phoenix bird  goes to a high place. She sheds her wings to make a nest then lays her eggs. She then flaps her wings and with the sun overhead she bursts into flames taking her offspring with her so she can be reborn. In the Greek version a beautiful girl had to be sacrificed to Zeus but Zeus loved her so much, she came back as a beautiful bird. In order to maintain her existence Zeus required a sacrifice of her first born male offspring. That is why Laura has to have David in order to rise from her ashes. The series was wonderful. I missed watching these first episodes before Barnabas. As I said before there are technical flaws in these episodes that could not be helped. Looking forward to owning all the Beginning Series.",5,At Last The Witch Laura Has Come To Collinwood!!!,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,1766,"['Dark', 'sinister', 'full', 'gothic', 'fun', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'aired', 'TV', '1966', '1971', 'year', 'was', 'dedicated', 'Beginning', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'ever', 'came', 'show', 'Beginning', 'Collection', '4', 'episodes', '106-143', 'are', '4', 'discs', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'are', 'tying', 'loose', 'ends', 'Mathew', 'Morgan', 'who', 'kidnaps', 'Victoria', 'secret', 'room', 'Disc', '2', 'episode', '123', 'Laura', 'Collins', 'appearance', 'coffee', 'shop', 'Maggie', 'questions', 'Collins', 'family', 'Disc', '3', 'ties', 'Mathew', 'Morgan', 'mystery', 'Laura', 'Collinwood', 'take', 'David', 'just', 'introduction', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'Laura', 'Sam', 'Evans', 'possessed', 'paint', 'Laura', 'portrait', 'consumed', 'fire', 'painting', 'David', 'Note', 'Josette', 'Collin', 'work', 'trying', 'warn', 'family', 'Laura', 'Also', 'Laura', 'supposed', 'be', 'phoenix', 'bird', 'Ancient', 'Egyptian', 'Mythology', 'understand', 'series', 'taking', 'more', 'Greek', 'version', 'Phoenix', 'Bird', 'Egyptian', 'version', 'Phoenix', 'bird', 'high', 'place', 'wings', 'make', 'nest', 'then', 'eggs', 'then', 'flaps', 'wings', 'sun', 'overhead', 'flames', 'taking', 'offspring', 'can', 'be', 'reborn', 'Greek', 'version', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'had', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'Zeus', 'Zeus', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'came', 'back', 'beautiful', 'bird', 'order', 'maintain', 'existence', 'Zeus', 'required', 'sacrifice', 'first', 'born', 'male', 'offspring', 'why', 'Laura', 'have', 'David', 'order', 'rise', 'ashes', 'series', 'was', 'wonderful', 'missed', 'watching', 'first', 'episodes', 'Barnabas', 'said', 'are', 'technical', 'flaws', 'episodes', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'helped', 'Looking', 'forward', 'owning', 'Beginning', 'Series']",N/A
