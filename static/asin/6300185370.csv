205984,A3VDGERHHLOQVQ,6300185370,Crabby Apple Mick Lee,"[73, 77]","A sort of throwback to the screwball comedies of the 1930's.  It reminds one of the pairings of Cary Grant and Kate Hepburn such as Bringing Up Baby or The Philadelphia Story.  By that as it may, I have watched this film several times over the years and I am repeatedly impressed with the level of comic intensity throughout the narrative.  The plot line is simple enough:  a fairly solid looking man has great success built on a secret.  Rock Hudson has written a well-regarded book on fishing.  The secret is Hudson has never been fishing in his life.  Along comes Paula Prentiss who corners Hudson into participating in a fishing tournament at her outdoors resort.  Of course, in the end Hudson wins the tournament and is exposed for the fraud he is.  In spite of being proved to be a fake, Hudson comes out on top and falls for Prentiss as well.As a story none of this is believable but that is never the point.  What we have is a story in which silliness is the point.  How we get from beginning to end is where the art is.  There is no serious message here which is why this film is as light and appealing now as it was forty years ago.  It is also startlingly clean as sex comedies go.  There is no foul language and the most ""flesh"" one sees is a smidgen of panty from an unzipped dress.We tend to think ourselves as a bit superior about these old movies in that we know Hudson was gay in real life.  ""Ha Ha Ha.  People back then really believed that Hudson would have fallen for Prentiss. .Ha Ha Ha""  Well stuff it.  Hudson was an actor who wanted to make us laugh.

It's really pretty bad.  Rock Hudson stars as a fumpfering salesman at the San Francisco Abercrombie & Fitch men's store, whose specialty is selling fishing gear (fishing being a manly, manly pastime...)  The thing is, he doesn't actually do any fishing himself, and when his boss enters him in a big, manly fishing tournament, he runs the risk of being exposed as a fraud.  (Wow!  Heavy drama!  Hold me back.)  Then enter into the mix co-star Paula Prentiss, whose brief glimmer of stardom is truly inexplicable... She's so awful, and so weird!  Her timing is really strange, and her attempts at seeming impish or elfin just make her look like that much more of a weirdo.  She's a very poor substitute for Doris Day, Rock's main co-star at the time... There's also an odd quality to the film itself that throws the pacing off and makes it perpetually wobbly.  I'm not sure, but I think part of it may be that many scenes were actually extended improvs, relying on Pretiss's wackiness and vivacity to carry the day.  It doesn't work, believe me.  This film may have been the high point of her career, but it's an embarrassment for Hudson.",2,"Weak script, iffy acting... poor Rock!!",1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,1254,"['one', 'movies', 'where', 'say', 'Hey', 'No', 'fair', 'want', 'hours', 'life', 'back', 'again', 'really', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'fumpfering', 'salesman', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Abercrombie', 'Fitch', 'men', 'store', 'specialty', 'selling', 'fishing', 'gear', 'fishing', 'being', 'manly', 'manly', 'pastime', 'thing', ""n't"", 'actually', 'do', 'fishing', 'when', 'boss', 'enters', 'big', 'manly', 'fishing', 'tournament', 'risk', 'being', 'exposed', 'fraud', 'Wow', 'Heavy', 'drama', 'Hold', 'back', 'Then', 'enter', 'mix', 'co-star', 'Paula', 'Prentiss', 'brief', 'glimmer', 'stardom', 'truly', 'inexplicable', 'so', 'awful', 'so', 'weird', 'timing', 'really', 'strange', 'attempts', 'seeming', 'impish', 'elfin', 'just', 'make', 'look', 'much', 'more', 'weirdo', 'very', 'poor', 'substitute', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Rock', 'main', 'co-star', 'time', 'also', 'odd', 'quality', 'film', 'pacing', 'off', 'perpetually', 'wobbly', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'think', 'part', 'may', 'be', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'actually', 'extended', 'improvs', 'relying', 'Pretiss', 'wackiness', 'vivacity', 'carry', 'day', ""n't"", 'work', 'believe', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'point', 'career', 'embarrassment', 'Hudson']",Man's Favorite Sport VHS

This movie takes me back to a simpler time and place that probably never existed but is so cool. The main character (Rock) works at Abercrombie & Fitch in San Francisco, back when A&F actually sold outdoor gear -- fishing tackle, canoes, waders, everything for the avid outdoorsman. What keeps this romantic comedy fresh and timeless is the juxtaposition of Rock's ostensibly macho character with two clever and capable outdoorswomen played by Paula Prentiss and Austrian beauty Maria Perschey. Though he has literally written the book on fly-fishing, Roger Willoughby (Rock) has never been fishing or camping in his life. To salvage his reputation and an upcoming fishing tournament, the women have less than a week to teach him the ropes.

She is very obnoxious in the beginning, exasperating in the middle part, and when you get to know her better later, she just seems puzzling.  If that's the character the casting director wanted, then he sure got a good one!In the best of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson comedies, the movie seems too short to hold all the great dialogue resulting from the characters' personalities; in this movie though,  you get the opposite feeling,  that the characters can't just sit there, they HAVE to say SOMETHING to fill up the space.

205995,A276M3NSIY9B82,6300185370,Harry Brewer,"[2, 2]","As an actor Rock Hudson wasn't considered to have much potential early in his career. He eventually became a good dramatic actor, it wasn't easy, he wasn't the most gifted or talented but he worked hard at his craft. What a surprise it was when he went into comedy. His pairings with Doris Day, for the most part, are outstanding examples of romantic comedies. Man's Favorite Sport? could have easily had Doris Day also.It is sort of strange to look back on Hudson's career after the revelations came out when he was near death. Whatever his personal preferences he was a solid actor & proved very adept at comedy though it is unique to see his interactions with female leads. Man's Favorite Sport? is a solid comedy that's well worth more than one viewing.Roger Willoughby (Rock Hudson) is a salesman at a sporting goods store & has the reputation of being a great fisherman, in fact, he has written a book on it. Many customers call and/or visit him to get his advice. What no one knows is that he's never fished in his life. Enter Abigail Page (Paula Prentiss) & Isolde ""Easy"" Mueller (Maria Perschy- the nickname is never explained) who want Willoughby to enter a fishing tournament. Willoughby confesses to the two women he doesn't have a clue about fishing so they agree to teach him in the seven days before the tournament. Willoughby is extremely unwilling but his boss, William Cadwalader (John McGiver), convinces him it's in the best interest of retaining his job.The laughs abound as Willoughby proves to be as inept as a fisherman there ever was. The scenes with Roger & Abigail are funny & it's inevitable that Abigail falls for him. Unfortunately Roger is engaged & Abigail is a walking disaster. Love & luck overcomes it all & Willoughby wins at both. Then he has to confess that he's never fished in his life.Good solid movie that was directed by one of Hollywood's greatest directors, Howard Hawks. This film has some similarities to his screwball comedies of the thirties & forties.

205996,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6300185370,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[7, 9]","Long after his heyday, legendary director Howard Hawks underwent a career resurgence in the early 60's with his box office hits RIO BRAVO (1959) and HATARI! (1962). MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT?, released in 1964, was Hawks's next offering and didn't perform as well in the movie theater. It was the fourth-to-last film he would direct and was intended to be a starring vehicle for Cary Grant, who eventually turned down the role. So in stepped the capable Rock Hudson, who may not be Cary Grant but still was flying high on his two recent successful pairings with Doris Day (PILLOW TALK and LOVER COME BACK).Here's the plot: MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT? involves sporting goods salesman Roger Willoughby (Rock Hudson) who, based on the popular fishing book he'd written and being hailed as an authority on angling, is invited by Abby Page (Paula Prentiss), the public relations director of the Lake Wakapoogie resort, to participate in its 36th Annual Fishing Tournament, which commences in a week's time. But, unbeknownst to everyone, Roger had never before fished in his life! Nevertheless, with an adamant Ms. Page insisting that he compete or lose his cushy job, Roger has no choice but to learn how to be an outdoorsman in three days, with the dubious assistance of Abby...Um, Roger better bring his book.This very funny film is a fond callback to the screwball comedies of yore, which really isn't that big of a stretch for Howard Hawks as he himself was responsible for several of the best screwballs ever crafted (TWENTIETH CENTURY, BRINGING UP BABY, HIS GIRL FRIDAY, and BALL OF FIRE). Come to think of it, this film's basic premise is borrowed straight from a William Powell subplot in LIBELED LADY, while Hawks recycles a hilarious sequence from his own BRINGING UP BABY. No, MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT? may not be classic Hawks, but it sparkles enough in its generosity in side-splitting humor and in its breezy Rated G sexcapades. Yes, Roger does manage to nab some fish but certainly not thru any traditional angling means. A bear even figures into two of the comedic sequences, one sequence kinda lame but the other, very funny. But, for all its outdoorsy trappings, this flick is still very decidedly a sophisticated and appealing exercise in bawdiness, rife with visual titillations and innuendos. The fact that Henry Mancini smoothly provides the scoring merely adds to the playful suggestiveness...While the Gods of the Funny didn't see fit to bestow upon Mr. Hudson Cary Grant's gift for sublimely nuanced expressions and gestures, he does compensate here with several moments of inspired physical comedy. Hudson does attempt to channel Grant at his most befuddled and somewhat succeeds. All in all, Rock Hudson's performance is to be commended. I haven't seen a lot of Paula Prentiss, but she is deliriously good here as she follows Hawks' established pattern for his leading ladies. As Abby Page, she's pushy, ditzy, and winsomely oblivious, the 1960s reincarnation of Katherine Hepburn's Susan Vance. And, oh my, those legs...Two other lovely women are spotlighted in their splendid scantiness: the good-natured  Maria Perschy as Abby's teutonic pal Easy and Charlene Holt as Roger's fiancee Tex. Norman Alden provides a few worn chuckles as John Screaming Eagle, the resort's scheming American Indian with a hidden heart of gold.At just around 2 hours long, the movie moves at a brisk pace. This film may not showcase Howard Hawks at his all-time best, but it's not exactly a spoonful of doodoo, either. At 68 years old, he definitely still had mastery of his craft. Hudson and Prentiss provide some diverting give and take. I particularly enjoy Prentiss's offbeat delivery of her lines as well as her uninhibited laughter. Now, you may not learn much about the outdoors from this flick (that ten-eleven-then-nine-o'clock casting routine just doesn't work for me), but you'll have fun snickering at Roger Willoughby as he miserably stews in his own haplessness, with the cheerful Abby each time seemingly laying the groundwork for his next mishap. And, if you're a guy, you get to ogle at some gorgeous women in their nighties.

MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT is a throwback to his early screwball comedies featuring Cary Grant and Kate Hepburn (i.e. BRINGING UP BABY) and even pays homage to '...BABY' recreating a scene from the film. In ""...BABY"", Kate Hepburn's dress is torn at the back, exposing her undergarments, during a posh dinner party. Cary Grant must walk her out by walking behind her and holding her very close in unison with her every step. Rock Hudson does the same thing with actress Maria Perschy in '...Sport' when her dress is torn and exposing her back undergarments during a fishing lodge dinner party.  Rodger Willoughby (Hudson) works at a sporting goods store selling fishing equipment and giving expert fishing advice to patrons. He has even ""written"" books on the subject. However, he has never been, knows nothing, and hates the sport of fishing.  He is then entered into a fishing contest at a resort at the request of the resorts publicity director Abagail (Paula Prentiss) and given the go ahead by the store's manager William Cadwalader (the great character actor John McGiver). When the truth is revealed to her by Rodger, he is entered anyway and must learn the sport along the way and try not to be exposed as a fraud.  Naturally, by sheer luck and hilarious comedic circumstances he is able ""catch"" some fish and win the contest. Hudson, fresh from his bedroom farces with Doris Day is excellent as his character is the victim of all kinds of predicaments brought on by Abagail (Prentiss), who in turn is so annoyingly adorable. Great performances all around with some great support characters, namely Norman Alden (BACK TO THE FUTURE, ED WOOD) as John Screaming Eagle, the so-called lake resort 'Indian' guide, and John McGiver as William Cadwalader as Hudson's boss at the department store.
