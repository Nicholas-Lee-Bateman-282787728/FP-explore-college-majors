You've got random dorky characters spouting off lame esoteric  dialogue then getting killed by the wooden dummy, Morty.  Come on!  You've  just GOTTA love a movie where the killer is named MORTY.  The movie had  everything a guilty pleasures flick has to offer. . .EXCEPT the nudity.  Had the filmmakers added nudity into the film, I would've been even  happier.  But, you can't have everything.  This movie is a LOT  of fun.",5,"COME ON, FOLKS!

But  then, it's the same company which made Jack Frost. The movie is funny and  has a average gore. It's also a low budget move, you can see that. It kind  of reminds me of the first Friday 13th, maybe because Betsy Palmer plays  the characther of Grandma. I would highly recommend this movie for everyone  who like slasher films.",4,What a great movie!,968457600,"09 9, 2000",2000,472,"['could', 'be', 'beginning', 'new', 'series', 'killer', 'could', 'be', 'next', 'Jason', 'Freddy', 'posessed', 'wood', 'doll', 'who', 'people', 'new', 'then', 'same', 'company', 'made', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'movie', 'funny', 'average', 'gore', 'also', 'low', 'budget', 'move', 'can', 'see', 'kind', 'reminds', 'first', 'Friday', '13th', 'maybe', 'Betsy', 'Palmer', 'characther', 'Grandma', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone', 'who', 'slasher', 'films']",The Fear: Halloween Night

I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters and the film would have been greatly improved if they had all been massacred by the man it the rubber suit that was supposed to look like a  wooden carving. By the way, how many wooden carvings do you know that  blink!  The main male character was the worst of all and made me want to  plunge my hand into the TV screen and strangle him. The acting didn't make  up for any of the other dissapointments; particularly the acting from that  guy who was trying to pull off an English accent.",1,WARNING ALL HORROR FANS,946512000,"12 30, 1999",1999,561,"['truly', 'poor', 'film', 'had', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'characters', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'greatly', 'improved', 'had', 'been', 'massacred', 'man', 'rubber', 'suit', 'was', 'supposed', 'look', 'wooden', 'carving', 'way', 'how', 'many', 'wooden', 'carvings', 'do', 'know', 'blink', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'was', 'worst', 'made', 'want', 'plunge', 'hand', 'TV', 'screen', 'strangle', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'other', 'dissapointments', 'particularly', 'acting', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'pull', 'off', 'English', 'accent']",The Fear: Halloween Night
