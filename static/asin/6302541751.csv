319440,APD2VE5UTWG1P,6302541751,"Alter Ego ""alter ego""","[16, 18]","Among Whovians, 'Shada' has achieved a deservedly legendary status (written by bestselling author Douglas Adams, and starring arguably the most popular actor to play the Doctor, Tom Baker). The story seemed forever lost down a video black hole, as it was only partially completed in 1979 when a BBC strike shut down production. When the strike ended, the completed footage was shelved, and Adams wouldn't allow the story to be novelized. It was a story no one had seen, from a script almost no one had read. Hence, a legend was born. And like many legends, the reality of this one doesn't live up to the hype. This video attempts to reconstruct the original story, with the BBC footage bridged by scenes of Tom Baker (recorded in a Doctor Who display), telling us what takes place between the surviving scenes. Adams' complicated plot doesn't  get the support it needs from the plentiful narration, and the story gets muddled along the way. Also, as many of the pivotal scenes were never shot, too much was left to our imaginations for the story to hold together. The only redeeming quality the video has are some delightful scenes between The Doctor, his companion Romana (played by Lalla Ward, then Baker's so-to-be-wife), and the eccentric retired Time Lord at the heart of the story, Prof. Chronotis. These scenes are almost worth sitting through the seemingly endless narrations, and trying to follow the wayward plot. The British edition of this video contained a paperback reprinting the original shooting script, and it wasn't until I read it that I was trully able to enjoy the story. (Which, it turns out, wasn't Adams at his best.)

319443,A20FK68BUB1IVA,6302541751,Happy Reader,"[1, 1]","Long ago, the Time Lords created Shada, a prison planet specifically to house the worst of the worst, that is, creatures who had tried to conquer the universe. Just one of those imprisoned was Salyavin, a Time Lord of enormous mental powers and mind control. But don't bother looking for Shada. Its location has been lost in the mists of time. Or not.The episode starts on the Think Tank space station. Using a device with a strange sphere, great thinkers and scientists share their knowledge, to be accumulated in the sphere. But then one of them, Doctor Skagra, goes megalomaniac. He uses the sphere to drain his colleague's minds and sets out to, well, conquer the universe. But to insure his victory, he needs one last almost all-powerful mind to steal, that of the Time Lord Salyavin. There are rumors that there is one person alive who knows Shada's location, an elderly Time Lord who has retired to Cambridge, Earth, under the name Professor Chronotis. Skagra sets out for Earth.Fortunately for the universe, The Doctor (Tom Baker), Romana II (Lalla Ward) and K9 also make a visit to Cambridge. Professor Chronotis is the Doctor's old friend, and he's asked the Doctor to visit him and help him find a book he seems to have misplaced. If you call a friend from across time and space to find a book, it may not be an ordinary book.I have not been a fan of the older cobbled together episodes of Doctor Who, working around missing sections or scenes.  But ""Shada"" may be an exception for me, and I'm buying the DVD when it comes out. I like the story line (I usually do like a story by Douglas Adams) and it's got my favorite Classic doctor and my favorite companion (K9, not Romana!). I do note, however, that Adams himself wasn't keen on his story. According to wikipedia, ""Adams himself did not regard the story highly and was content for it remain permanently unseen in any form. He once claimed that when he had signed the contract allowing the 1992 [VHS] release, it had been part of a pile of other papers presented to him by his agent to sign and he wasn't fully aware of what he was agreeing to.""""Shada"" was meant to be the last episode of Tom Baker's sixth series as the Doctor, to probably air Jan/Feb 1980. About 50% of the episode was filmed; all the outside scenes and the first of three studio sessions. A strike halted production, and afterwards, when they could have restarted, there was no spot for Doctor Who. The studios had to be used for filming Christmas specials.John Nathan-Turner got Tom Baker to record narration for the missing scenes and a VHS of ""Shada"" was released in 1992. (You can still find it for sale on amazon.) In 2003, a radio version, with a partially revised storyline, was released (available on CD). It had Lalla Ward as Romana and Paul McGann as the Doctor. Some colored animation was added to the audio for webcast.Completed in September 2011, Ian Levine privately funded a completed version of Shada using animation to fill in the missing sections. He rounded up the original actors for the voices, except for John Leeson filling in for David Brierley as K9, and Paul Jones impersonating Tom Baker as the Doctor. The ""Shada"" rights-holder, though, has stated they will not be issuing Levine's version. But that was last fall, 2011, so who knows what negotiations may be going on.Regardless of what ""Shada"" version or versions are issued, the big extra on the DVD will be the 1995 documentary ""Doctor Who - More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS"". This 87 minute special was released on VHS, and you can find copies for sale on amazon, with majority 5-star reviews.Other extras will be included, but little information has been released. In October, 2011, classicdw tweeted that another extra will be a short called ""Death Comes to Time"", shot (mostly) on location in Cambridge.................Added October 2012It's official.

319449,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,6302541751,Matthew Kresal,"[2, 3]","Shada has one of the most complicated behind the scenes stories of all time. Originally conceived as the six-part finale of the 1979-1980 season of Doctor Who by Douglas Adams (then script editor and creator of Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy) and was extensively set at Cambridge University. Now all of the location filming at Cambridge had been completed and some of the studio work done before an actors strike halted the production. Then the decision was made not to finish all of the filming. Then in 1992, the BBC finally decided to take the recorded footage from 1979 and use Tom Baker to help tie those sequences that were never filmed with narration. This is the result.To say the least this is one of the most impressive Doctor Who adventures. Adams script is taught, tense, and even fun at times. The story is complicated to say the least and is virtually impossible to quickly summarize. Yet despite this (or rather because of it) the story keeps your riveted to the screen and waiting for the next scene right up until the very end.The performances by the actors are good and amongst the better ones of the series. Tom Baker is at his height as the Doctor, playing everything so well that it is hard to find a problem with it. Lalla Ward is well as Romana and this is one of her better episodes as well. Beyond them is a strong supporting cast in the form of Denis Carey as Professor Chronotis, the retired Time Lord who is not what he seems. Christopher Neame as the evil Skagra, who is evil despite the laughable costume (white outfit, complete with silver cloak and hat) and the addition of the mind draining sphere helps immensely.The story was never fully filmed and is tied together by clips of narration featuring Tom Baker. This is actually a pro rather then a con. Baker brilliantly reprises his role of the Doctor and narrates the story's missing parts expertly. Baker gives in his narration an inkling of what Shada could have and should have been. It is a testament to his power as an actor that the story works as well as it does in an uncompleted form.The one big minus of the story is in the special effects. The special effects are up to par with those of the series at the time. Yet there are some special effects featuring spacecrafts that don't work at all. It seems that the producers of the video decided that these special effects should only give an inkling of what was intended. A great shame really.Shada is the sum of its parts. With the combination of a fine script, fine performances, great humor, some terrific location filming, and some brilliant narration by Tom Baker, Shada is more then just a lost story from a classic series. It is an inkling of what could have a Doctor Who classic. While it is isn't as good as seeing a full-fledged story (though Big Finish audio did the full story in audio form starring Paul McGann's eighth Doctor) this is still an amazing sci-fi epic.
