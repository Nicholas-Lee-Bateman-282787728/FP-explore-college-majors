It's full of pictures and information about her childhood, her breakdown and why she, like her voice,  is a fragile gift.I love her songs, talent, and her courage to not only ""sing her heart out"", but to cross those divides that the show biz world places you into so that THEY can package your talent.  She has the talent, the voice and the grace to sing across the genres of the music world.I say sing on Susan and give us more across those song barriers!!

All in all, an amateurish result.  However, since I am a fan of Susan, I would recommend other fans buying the DVD.  She is going to become extremely famous one day and this, albeit inferior, DVD will become a collector's item.
