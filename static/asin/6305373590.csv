It was definitely worth it. John  Waters had some pretty entertaining people in his Dreamland group but Edith  Massey was definitely the most loveable. I'm glad this warm hearted  documentary short (15 minutes, but worth it) was made before she passed  away. There's some great footage of her talking about her past as a  bar-girl in her endearing way. You'd never think hearing someone with 6  teeth talk would be so enjoyable.

No one knew it, but she showed the world what the true meaning of love was.  You can actually see her halo hovering above her head when she sits in the play-pen in ""Pink Flamingos"" and shouts, ""Oh Mr. Eggman.  I love you so much!  Oh Babs!  What if there were no more eggs?""  Our own Virgin Mary never got this far.  What about Queen Carlotta from ""Desperate Living""?  ""Would you like some pizza little birdy?"" or ""Oh!  Ready, aim, FIRE!""  The best Catholic-ismatic moment had to be her pleading with her son 'Gator' in ""Female Trouble"".  ""Oh Gator.  I'd be so proud if you was a (...) and had a beautician boyfriend.  I'd never have to worry!  THe woRLd of heteroSexuAls is A sick AND boRIng LIFE!""  Her delivery was priceless!  If you ever had the chance to meet her or see her in one of her live acts, you would know what a kind and sweethearted person there was behind those over-sized (...) and matching tooths.  Yes, tooths.  This tape will probably never make it to DVD, as it is too short, as was Edie's life.
