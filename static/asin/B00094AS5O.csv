Saw this movie when it first came out and has been a favorite of mine ever since. Kelly Lynch is excellent and for a dark drama has lots of humorous under tones and a amazing ending.This is diffinately one for collectors.A must see to believe,4,Love this one!,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,306,"['what', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'sleeper', 'then', 'dont', 'wake', 'up', 'Saw', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'ever', 'Kelly', 'Lynch', 'excellent', 'dark', 'drama', 'lots', 'humorous', 'tones', 'amazing', 'ending.This', 'diffinately', 'one', 'collectors.A', 'must', 'see', 'believe']",Warm Summer Rain
901301,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00094AS5O,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[11, 16]","""Warm Summer Rain"" brings to us feelings we have all experienced... isolation, hopelessness, bewilderment, doubt... and opens a vein of self-examination that asks basically... why? Why me, why life, why love? I thought this movie was a bit odd to me, but I quickly got into the momentum. As on one of the reviewers stated previously that it reminded him of the Twilight Zone, I clearly see why.In seeking meaning and purpose in the midst of social disparity, the couple exploits a temporary pseudo-marriage relationship that allows them intensity. If the dialogue, the feelings, and the interactions sometimes seem awkward, it is in keeping with the ages of the characters...The astonishing thing about this film is that it is perfectly aware of its characters problems, yet it doesn't bore us with much details....they meet, they do the most logical thing and have sex constantly in an abandoned house...they state their causes...and then try to conform somewhat to the outside world by the films ending. Kelly wants to be alone and she wants to be isolated. Combined with stunning imagery and camera work...even if you mute the sound's still feel the isolation and quiet moodiness of the film..compared to ""Last Tango""...this film is much better. ""Tango"" is loud it is repellent insensibly...this film is bright, evocative and mildly entertaining...it shouldn't be entertaining it's mostly suttle.If you are a film buff, and do not mind a different style of film, this is worthwhile. It does not leave you with such a great feeling, but overall it is done very well. Psychological, even philosophical; thought-provoking.",3,Kelly Lynch dancing with a five legged Iguana was sort of amusing.,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,1622,"['Warm', 'Summer', 'Rain', 'feelings', 'have', 'experienced', 'isolation', 'hopelessness', 'bewilderment', 'doubt', 'vein', 'self-examination', 'basically', 'why', 'Why', 'why', 'life', 'why', 'love', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'odd', 'quickly', 'got', 'momentum', 'one', 'reviewers', 'stated', 'previously', 'reminded', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'clearly', 'see', 'why.In', 'seeking', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'midst', 'social', 'disparity', 'couple', 'temporary', 'pseudo-marriage', 'relationship', 'intensity', 'dialogue', 'feelings', 'interactions', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'awkward', 'keeping', 'ages', 'characters', 'astonishing', 'thing', 'film', 'perfectly', 'aware', 'characters', 'problems', ""n't"", 'bore', 'much', 'details', '.they', 'meet', 'do', 'most', 'logical', 'thing', 'have', 'sex', 'constantly', 'abandoned', 'house', 'state', 'causes', 'then', 'try', 'conform', 'somewhat', 'outside', 'world', 'films', 'ending', 'Kelly', 'be', 'alone', 'be', 'isolated', 'Combined', 'stunning', 'imagery', 'camera', 'work', 'even', 'mute', 'sound', 'still', 'feel', 'isolation', 'quiet', 'moodiness', 'film..compared', 'Last', 'Tango', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'Tango', 'loud', 'repellent', 'insensibly', 'film', 'bright', 'evocative', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'entertaining', 'mostly', 'suttle.If', 'are', 'film', 'buff', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'different', 'style', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'not', 'leave', 'great', 'feeling', 'overall', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'Psychological', 'even', 'philosophical', 'thought-provoking']",Warm Summer Rain

901303,A1JEFESGLIS076,B00094AS5O,rsoonsa,"[16, 20]","Although given short shrift by the few critics who watched it, this is a worthy effort, marked by good acting, direction, technicals, and an intelligent script. Although in a state of undress through much of the film, Kelly Lynch is given an opportunity to display the full panoply of her acting range as there are essentially only two actors. And, as so often with independent films, all involved have an opportunity to be truly creative. The desert setting enhanced the starkness of the extreme emotions to which the viewer is exposed.",4,DOESN'T DESERVE NEGLECT,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,537,"['given', 'short', 'shrift', 'few', 'critics', 'who', 'watched', 'worthy', 'effort', 'marked', 'good', 'acting', 'direction', 'technicals', 'intelligent', 'script', 'state', 'undress', 'much', 'film', 'Kelly', 'Lynch', 'given', 'opportunity', 'display', 'full', 'panoply', 'acting', 'range', 'are', 'essentially', 'only', 'two', 'actors', 'so', 'often', 'independent', 'films', 'involved', 'have', 'opportunity', 'be', 'truly', 'creative', 'desert', 'setting', 'enhanced', 'starkness', 'extreme', 'emotions', 'viewer', 'exposed']",Warm Summer Rain
901304,A5TZXWU8AALIC,B00094AS5O,The JuRK,"[12, 16]","The only thing that kept me watching this movie was to see if there was going to be a Twilight Zone-type ending that tied it all together.Remember the Zone where five wildly-different people (a clown, a cowboy, a ballerina, etc.) are trapped in a round room and, when they finally escape, you find out that they're just dolls in a trash can?  It was a lame Zone, but I thought of that watching this movie as Kelly Lynch wanted to stay inside that abandoned desert house--and wondered if that house was going to be a place between Life and Death.  That Kelly might have been hovering between the two in that room and that her new ""husband"" was Satan.  Or an angel.  Something really off-the-wall.But it didn't happen.  It's pretty much a straight-forward story of dysfunctional low-lifes trying to figure out their messy lives--without telling us very much about themselves.  The acting is very good and Kelly Lynch looks great naked (even with bandages on her wrists and wearing a dirty hosptial gown for the whole movie), but the story gets lost in the desert.And what the heck happened to that baby that shows up for a couple of scenes and then disappears?That's what I was wondering about for the rest of the movie but nothing more is said.",2,Ultimately Pretty Pointless,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,1243,"['only', 'thing', 'kept', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'see', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Twilight', 'Zone-type', 'ending', 'tied', 'together.Remember', 'Zone', 'where', 'five', 'wildly-different', 'people', 'clown', 'cowboy', 'ballerina', 'etc', 'are', 'trapped', 'round', 'room', 'when', 'finally', 'escape', 'find', 'out', ""'re"", 'just', 'dolls', 'trash', 'can', 'was', 'lame', 'Zone', 'thought', 'watching', 'movie', 'Kelly', 'Lynch', 'wanted', 'stay', 'abandoned', 'desert', 'house', 'wondered', 'house', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'place', 'Life', 'Death', 'Kelly', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'hovering', 'two', 'room', 'new', 'husband', 'was', 'Satan', 'angel', 'Something', 'really', 'off-the-wall.But', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight-forward', 'story', 'dysfunctional', 'low-lifes', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'messy', 'lives', 'telling', 'very', 'much', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'Kelly', 'Lynch', 'great', 'naked', 'even', 'bandages', 'wrists', 'wearing', 'dirty', 'hosptial', 'gown', 'whole', 'movie', 'story', 'lost', 'desert.And', 'what', 'heck', 'happened', 'baby', 'up', 'couple', 'scenes', 'then', 'disappears', 'what', 'was', 'wondering', 'rest', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'said']",Warm Summer Rain
