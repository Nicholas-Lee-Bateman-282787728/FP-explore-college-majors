Other standouts include the sight of Gene wearing a shower cap while applying his makeup, the extremely lucky Paul Stanley surrounded by gorgeous butt nekkid women for a photo shoot as well as the amazing work that goes into designing the set for the tour and Peter Criss's brilliant drum solo.The DVD also includes the live video of SHOUT IT OUT LOUD, and live performances of DETROIT ROCK CITY and SHANDI. This could be dismissed by some as just another license to print money to put in the pockets of the ageing Comic Book Monsters Of Rock, but if you're a die hard fan you'll probably enjoy it. It's just a shame that they're trying to relive their makeup glory days, it would have been cool to have seen some material from CREATURES OF THE NIGHT or REVENGE on here. Just because they weren't recorded with the Klassic Kiss lineup doesn't mean they're throwaways.

472593,A5R3U8ZSFKAL4,6305668698,"Paul Lawrence ""'EJL'""","[1, 1]","This release can be viewed in a number of ways. Firstly, on the face of it, the DVD is a rockumentary about the renewal of the partnership between what most fans of this multi-million dollar entertainment industry would call the classic line up. To wit; Stanley, Simmons, Frehley and Criss. And as to that, it's very well done. There is the usual hyperbole about this and that but there are also some quite considered answers by pretty much all the participants about how this coming together of the band was not pre ordained nor a certainty. Following the story right from the word go the DVD traces the various behind the scenes issues that had to be dealth with just to get such an undertaking off the ground and the band are to be thanked for their candid comments.Mixed in with the serious stuff is also some tomfoolery. Whatever their many and varied and well documented interpersonal issues when these guys are getting on they are really getting on. Having fought through the hard early years together has clearly made a bond between them which is perhaps why their latter day fueding was so vicious. Your friends know just how to hurt you, ya know?As the DVD continues we get more hard rock concert footage and get to see the band as they criss cross the globe, snippets of interviews thrown in and it must be said that this is very well paced. Director Tommy Thayer really deserves a serious round of applause as this release could so easily have lapsed into a sordid back slapping session. It could of also gotten very tedious and could of jumped around too much to be coherent.The extras are basically some live tracks - apparently you didn't get this on the VHS version of the release. None are really essential, they are just an adjunct to the main course of the film. Still, it's always good to see extra value.While this DVD could also be viewed as a cynical cash in exercise on their renewed profile in the wake of their temporary reconvening I'll leave the cynicism to Gene and just sit back and enjoy the show. And the reason for only four stars - well as much as I found it an interesting and pleasant enough movie I'm not sure people other than major fans are going to want to watch this again and again which limits it's usefulness.
