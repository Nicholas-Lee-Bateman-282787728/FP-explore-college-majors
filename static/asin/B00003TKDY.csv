We have been collecting his movies and Murder 101 is an excellent thriller, murder mystery.Pierce Brosnan plays the part of a recently separated from his wife English professor by the name of Charles Lattimore who teaches students how to write, but encourages them to develop characters involved in crime and challenges these young aspiring authors to write about how to do the perfect murder.Charles Lattimore has returned to teaching because he still loves his wife who now dates a professor at the same school. Thanks to his teaching job, he has access to her as he tries to mend the relationship.We know that the professor has written a best selling book about a real case that ended up sending a friend to prison for killing his wife. Some of the students are brilliant and they take this professor head on to plan a murder in such a way that the investigating officers are unable to solve it. One female student attempts to date the professor and the plot thickens for she is murdered and now the professor is involved in the plot.To give other details would detract from the thrill of following this fast paced mystery but you will enjoy it because it is well written and masterfully executed.

Suffice to say, Condon's neat little script gives us two big surprises at the end.  The murderer is hard to spot and the ending is just &quot;Wow, did I just see what I think I saw?&quot;At any rate, Pierce Brosnan in his pre Bond days stars as a best-selling crime writer who teaches a class in how to write the perfect crime novel.  Brosnan gained famed writing a true crime thriller that sent his friend to prison for murdering his wife.  Brosnan returns to teaching, to meet his estranged wife, played sweetly by Dey Young, who has taken up with another professor, played smarmily by Mark L. Taylor (Fangs).  Another friend of his is Detective Mike Dowley (played with a surly masculinity by Antoni Carone).  Soon, though, things take a demonic twist when Pierce is set up for murder by one of his students.  Rachel Sbarge in a crafty performance seems to be the one who is setting him up.The pace is good; the script witty and inventive; and overall, a tidy, surprising mystery.",5,TEACHER PET,1073347200,"01 6, 2004",2004,1136,"['MURDER', '101', 'written', 'directed', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'grab', 'Oscar', 'GODS', 'AND', 'MONSTERS', 'great', 'little', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Condon', 'neat', 'little', 'script', 'two', 'big', 'surprises', 'end', 'murderer', 'hard', 'spot', 'ending', 'just', 'quot', 'Wow', 'did', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'saw', 'quot', 'rate', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'pre', 'Bond', 'days', 'best-selling', 'crime', 'writer', 'who', 'class', 'how', 'write', 'perfect', 'crime', 'novel', 'Brosnan', 'gained', 'famed', 'writing', 'true', 'crime', 'thriller', 'sent', 'friend', 'prison', 'murdering', 'wife', 'Brosnan', 'teaching', 'meet', 'estranged', 'wife', 'played', 'sweetly', 'Dey', 'Young', 'who', 'taken', 'up', 'professor', 'played', 'smarmily', 'Mark', 'L.', 'Taylor', 'Fangs', 'friend', 'Detective', 'Mike', 'Dowley', 'played', 'surly', 'masculinity', 'Antoni', 'Carone', 'Soon', 'though', 'things', 'take', 'demonic', 'twist', 'when', 'Pierce', 'set', 'up', 'murder', 'one', 'students', 'Rachel', 'Sbarge', 'crafty', 'performance', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'setting', 'up.The', 'pace', 'good', 'script', 'witty', 'inventive', 'overall', 'tidy', 'surprising', 'mystery']",Murder 101
