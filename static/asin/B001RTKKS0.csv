1234004,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B001RTKKS0,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 0]","Incendiary starring Michelle Williams and Ewan McGregor is an uneven, slow moving film but overall - I found this drama worth watching thanks to Williams's brave and heart-wrenching performance. Williams grabs the viewer in the first frame of the film, she is magnetic and the little boy who plays her son is so darn cute! Williams holds this movie together (flawless British accent by the way) - I can't believe this is the same girl who once starred in that silly, little show - Dawson's Creek? This film is about the downward sprial of a woman who's life gets ripped to shreds after her son and husband are killed in a terrorist attack. Incendiary falls flat here and there but it's still worth seeing.

I avoided this movie for a long time because I didn't think that I liked the actress, Michelle Williams. However, I've liked many of Ewan McGregor's films so I thought I would give it a try. The acting was fantastic! I was expecting a suspense, but this movie was really a bit of an artsy drama about simple people and a woman experiencing grief over the loss of her family. I was pleasantly surprised and would highly recommend it.",5,Highly Underrated Film,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,518,"['Great', 'film', 'Touching', 'characters', 'story', 'line', 'filmography', 'was', 'also', 'outstanding', 'avoided', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'liked', 'actress', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'However', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'many', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'films', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try', 'acting', 'was', 'fantastic', 'was', 'expecting', 'suspense', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'bit', 'artsy', 'drama', 'simple', 'people', 'woman', 'experiencing', 'grief', 'loss', 'family', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend']",Incendiary
1234006,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B001RTKKS0,barry,"[1, 1]","INCENDIARY is not being treated well by critics and I don't really understand why.  They seem to keep talking aboutr what the film could be rather than what it is.  And what it is is a film that is intense, difficult to watch and emotionally raw.  But it is an excellent film.  The story takes place in London and we are introduced to Michelle Williams.  She is a wife and mother.  She has an adorable son who she adores and a husband with whom she tries to deal but who seems to be emotionally empty.  The one interesting thing here that is bizarre is that Michelle's character has no actual name.  Even in the credits she is listed as YOUNG MOTHER.  What purpose this serves I don't really know but I must admit I didn't really notice it when viewing the film.Our story develops.  This young woman goes out to the bar occasionally at night and has the neighbor watch her child.  It is here she meets and sleeps with Ewan McGregor.  They start a sexual relationship and one weekend her husband takes the son to a soccer game.  This same day Michelle has sex with Ewan and the game is on during it.  There is a terrorist attack on the stadium and bombs explode.  The mother sees this on tv while being in the vulnerable sexual position.  She knows that her husband and son are at the game.  It is at this point that her world falls apart.  She goes to the stadium to try and find them and encounters hell on earth.Critics seem to feel more should have been explained about the terrorism aspect but the fact that the country is a constant victim of these suicide bombers is a reality.  This film is about the emotional impact all this has on the young wife/mother played by Michelle Williams.  There is a lot of voiceover where she tells  part of the story and the rest is pure emotion.  Michelle Williams owns this films and displays 100% the acting chops that she possesses.  She becomes this woman so completely that every plot line and everything that happens to her is heartwrenchingly believable.  She falls apart, builds herself up for yet more downfalls.  Ewan Mcgregor and Matthew MacFayden provide excellent support here but this is truly Ms. Williams fim.The journey she takes you on is spellbinding and any loose plot lines that may exist become nonexistent as you experience them with her.  Imagaine the pain and emotion involved with facing your worst fears and that is the ride Michelle Williams takes you on.  I fould the blu ray presentation to be glorious.  The 1080p video is electric and crisp with vibrant color and excellent flesh tones.  Blacks and whites blend for awesome contrast.  The audio is excellent.  It is a dialogue driven film but there are some strong audio moments like the stadium explosion and these scenes are bewidering to view.I highly recommend this film and blu ray.  It is disturbing subject matter but tells an important tale on the effects terrorism can have on an average person.  And you will also get a tour de force performance by Michelle Williams.  She is proving to be one of our best actresses and this performance and film are not to be missed.",4,Excellent controversial film - superb blu ray,1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,3099,"['INCENDIARY', 'not', 'being', 'treated', 'well', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'seem', 'keep', 'talking', 'what', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'rather', 'what', 'what', 'film', 'intense', 'difficult', 'watch', 'emotionally', 'raw', 'excellent', 'film', 'story', 'place', 'London', 'are', 'introduced', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'wife', 'mother', 'adorable', 'son', 'who', 'husband', 'whom', 'deal', 'who', 'be', 'emotionally', 'empty', 'one', 'interesting', 'thing', 'here', 'bizarre', 'Michelle', 'character', 'actual', 'name', 'Even', 'credits', 'listed', 'YOUNG', 'MOTHER', 'What', 'purpose', 'serves', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'must', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'when', 'viewing', 'film.Our', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'out', 'bar', 'occasionally', 'night', 'neighbor', 'watch', 'child', 'here', 'meets', 'sleeps', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'start', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'one', 'weekend', 'husband', 'son', 'soccer', 'game', 'same', 'day', 'Michelle', 'sex', 'Ewan', 'game', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'stadium', 'bombs', 'explode', 'mother', 'tv', 'being', 'vulnerable', 'sexual', 'position', 'husband', 'son', 'are', 'game', 'point', 'world', 'apart', 'stadium', 'try', 'find', 'encounters', 'hell', 'earth.Critics', 'seem', 'feel', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'explained', 'terrorism', 'aspect', 'fact', 'country', 'constant', 'victim', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'reality', 'film', 'emotional', 'impact', 'young', 'wife/mother', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'lot', 'voiceover', 'where', 'part', 'story', 'rest', 'pure', 'emotion', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'films', 'displays', '100', '%', 'acting', 'chops', 'woman', 'so', 'completely', 'plot', 'line', 'everything', 'heartwrenchingly', 'believable', 'apart', 'builds', 'herself', 'up', 'yet', 'more', 'downfalls', 'Ewan', 'Mcgregor', 'Matthew', 'MacFayden', 'provide', 'excellent', 'support', 'here', 'truly', 'Ms.', 'Williams', 'fim.The', 'journey', 'spellbinding', 'loose', 'plot', 'lines', 'may', 'exist', 'become', 'nonexistent', 'experience', 'Imagaine', 'pain', 'emotion', 'involved', 'facing', 'worst', 'fears', 'ride', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'fould', 'blu', 'ray', 'presentation', 'be', 'glorious', '1080p', 'video', 'electric', 'crisp', 'vibrant', 'color', 'excellent', 'flesh', 'tones', 'Blacks', 'whites', 'blend', 'awesome', 'contrast', 'audio', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'film', 'are', 'strong', 'audio', 'moments', 'stadium', 'explosion', 'scenes', 'are', 'bewidering', 'view.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'blu', 'ray', 'disturbing', 'subject', 'matter', 'important', 'tale', 'effects', 'terrorism', 'can', 'have', 'average', 'person', 'will', 'also', 'get', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'proving', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'performance', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Incendiary

All those other movies were good, but they were exactly what I was expecting them to be. ""Incendiary"" was one of the last movies I watched and it turned out to be the best. In fact it was one of the best movies I've seen in awhile and I watch alot of movies.I wasn't completely sold on Michele Willams, but Ewan McGregor drew me in and his role ended up being a rather small one. It's a great movie with alot of heart and raw emotion in it, Michelle Williams is the main focus of the movie and she doesn't disappoint.This is another one of those movies that has a slow build up and it just keeps building up until the climax.""Incendiary"" is based off the book by Chris Cleave, which was originally released right around or on the same day as the July 7th, 2005 London subway terrorist attacks.

1234009,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B001RTKKS0,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","This film is based loosely on the novel Incendiary by Chris Cleave. The film is well done but not great. The book is able to explore class conflicts and is full of dark humor whereas the film emphasizes the romantic quest of Jasper Black and Terrance Butcher for the heroine's affections.  Michelle Williams displays her considerable acting talents as a mother and wife who loses both her husband and child in a terrorist bombing in London. But we see that it was not a totally satisfying marriage since her husband is emotionally distant from her. Her husband works on the police bomb squad and is a bomb himself since he is emotionally suppressed and non-communicative with his wife, leaving her in a state of anxiety that she finds can be relieved by sexual trysts with men she meets in local pubs.  It is the loss of her child that is defeating her, destroying her emotional balance, and Williams plays the part very well. But as she recovers two very different men begin to court her, even though she continually has flashbacks of the bombing and thus spends much time and energy trying to stop both men from becoming attached to her. She meets a smooth operator in Jasper Black, a newspaper editorial writer. She is also courted by Terrance Butcher, her husband's supervisor's supervisor in the police department and the head of anti-terrorism efforts.  The film gives us several references to the great fire in London and to the bombings during World War II. The character played by Michelle Williams is very resilient, even exploring the family of one of the terrorist and empathizing with the 10 year old son of the terrorist. Parallel to the theme of terrorism is a romantic theme of two men trying to court the same woman and the stakes get pretty nasty. Despite the terror the film would indicate that live goes on, that people remain wounded but functional and even can grow to love again. The character played by Michelle Williams eventually displays this resiliency with her final lines in the film where she says: ""Come to be Osama. Come to me and we will blow the world back together WITH INCREDIBLE NOISE AND FURY.""",3,Recovering from terror and loss and guilt,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,2133,"['film', 'based', 'loosely', 'novel', 'Incendiary', 'Chris', 'Cleave', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'great', 'book', 'able', 'explore', 'class', 'conflicts', 'full', 'dark', 'humor', 'film', 'romantic', 'quest', 'Jasper', 'Black', 'Terrance', 'Butcher', 'heroine', 'affections', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'considerable', 'acting', 'talents', 'mother', 'wife', 'who', 'husband', 'child', 'terrorist', 'bombing', 'London', 'see', 'was', 'not', 'totally', 'satisfying', 'marriage', 'husband', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'husband', 'police', 'bomb', 'squad', 'bomb', 'emotionally', 'suppressed', 'non-communicative', 'wife', 'leaving', 'state', 'anxiety', 'can', 'be', 'relieved', 'sexual', 'trysts', 'men', 'local', 'pubs', 'loss', 'child', 'defeating', 'destroying', 'emotional', 'balance', 'Williams', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'begin', 'court', 'even', 'continually', 'flashbacks', 'bombing', 'thus', 'spends', 'much', 'time', 'energy', 'trying', 'stop', 'men', 'becoming', 'attached', 'smooth', 'operator', 'Jasper', 'Black', 'newspaper', 'editorial', 'writer', 'also', 'courted', 'Terrance', 'Butcher', 'husband', 'supervisor', 'supervisor', 'police', 'department', 'head', 'anti-terrorism', 'efforts', 'film', 'several', 'references', 'great', 'fire', 'London', 'bombings', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'character', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'very', 'resilient', 'even', 'exploring', 'family', 'one', 'terrorist', 'empathizing', '10', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'terrorist', 'Parallel', 'theme', 'terrorism', 'romantic', 'theme', 'two', 'men', 'trying', 'court', 'same', 'woman', 'stakes', 'get', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'terror', 'film', 'would', 'indicate', 'live', 'people', 'remain', 'wounded', 'functional', 'even', 'can', 'grow', 'love', 'again', 'character', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'eventually', 'resiliency', 'final', 'lines', 'film', 'where', 'Come', 'be', 'Osama', 'Come', 'will', 'blow', 'world', 'back', 'together', 'WITH', 'INCREDIBLE', 'NOISE', 'AND', 'FURY']",Incendiary

1234011,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001RTKKS0,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[34, 39]","This film took me by the heart. To me this was a film about a mother's love for her son, an all consuming love. To me, it had little to do with terrorism, fidelity, or a who done it mystery. Michele Williams is stupendous in the role of the young mother - she has no name in the film, just the young mother. The cinematography is outstanding. The sound recorded perfectly. And the story line was just wonderful. I felt the young mother's pain of losing her son.There are movies where the camera work is poor, good, or remarkable. This film is shot in that very small percentage of remarkable films. The opening sequences with the mother and her son on the beach are simply gorgeous, visually and audibly. They are flashed back many times during the film, and are so welcome. The director made the visual and sound so unique that even an out of focus view, virtually all tan; or the sound without the image; evokes the memory of that sequence. Framing is so well done. The director of photography got almost every scene on the mark - characters on the strong and weak sides of the frame, leading diagonals, color, movement - all done beautifully.The trailer for this film is so misleading. It looks like some treatise on terrorism, infidelity, a police cover up, a terrorism mystery...the film is none of these things. In fact they are simply pretexts to better define what this mother felt. The quotes at the very end of the film (revealing them would be a spoiler for the film) are so pointed at exactly this - parenthood and a love for their child. If you are expecting what is seen in the trailer, this film will be a huge disappointment.Michele Williams (The United States of LelandandThe Station Agent) is simply gorgeous in this film. During this film, she transforms from a mild mother, to a sweet housewife, to a crazed person. She is beautiful with her clothes on and off. The scene on the couch with her and Ewan McGregor is somewhat explicit and absolutely gorgeous. That particular moment was very strange, in that you know she is married, but her husband has somehow become a non-person in the movie. And the Ewan McGregor character is so much more perfect, or more charismatic. Their coupling just doesn't seem wrong somehow. It's not a moral situation (right or wrong), or played that way; it just is. The later scenes of her son are so much stronger after this moment occurs.Strangely this film has not enjoyed much popularity, success, or release. Shown at Sundance in 2008; quietly in limited theatrical release in early 2009; and just recently released on DVD. I would blame that all on very poor marketing. The DVD cover art almost gets it right.At one hour forty minutes, it is exactly the right length; pacing is perfect. The movie is rated R due to the scene with Jasper and the young wife. There's a bit of gore at the blown up football stadium. Very little strong language. The DVD includes almost no special features - the horrible trailer, and a set of very high quality still photographs done up in slideshow format. Focus is entirely on the movie.I'm surprised this film isn't more loved by more people. This one touched me very deeply and I loved Michele Williams and Ewan McGregor's performances.

This movie aims for that same nerve but it just doesn't come off.Here's the scoop. (Some Spoilers Here) Young Mother (Michelle Williams) is married to a guy who diffuses bombs. They have a 4 year old boy. She's having an affair with reporter Jasper Black (Ewan McGregor). Dad and son get killed in a terrorist bombing at a soccer game. Black figures something is fishy about the bombing. Young Mother starts up a friendship with the son of one of the bombers.So what's this supposed to be about. Part of it is the mourning we experience as a people when something horrible like this happens. Then there's McGregor uncovering a conspiracy. Then there's Young Mother and her friendship with the terrorist's son. This movie is all over the place. The pieces just don't fit together. And when you head off down one path you're forced into a whiplash turn down another so the movie can't gain any momentum.

1234016,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001RTKKS0,Grady Harp,"[2, 5]","The Many Faces of Terrorism, May 24, 2009By  Grady Harp (Los Angeles, CA United States) - See all my reviewsINCENDIARY comes as a surprise release on DVD: did it even have a theatrical release? Based on a book by Chris Cleave and adapted for the screen by director Sharon Maguire, this little film is notable on many levels. First, the story is another look at the topic of terrorism, revealing the effects of these senseless catastrophes much like America's 9/11 tragedy on all players - the survivors of the victims, the survivors of the perpetrators, and the way so much of life changes in the wake of explosive surprises and the strength to survive in the aftermath of these traumas.A Young Mother (an astonishingly fine performance by Michelle Williams) opens the film with thoughts and demonstrations of the love she holds for her young son (Sidney Johnson) while she copes with the too frequent absences of her husband Lenny (Nicholas Gleaves): Lenny is part of London's Anti-terrorism division of the police force. The feeling of unfulfilled desires by this isolated young woman are magnified as she watches her newspaper reporter neighbor Jasper Black (Ewan McEwan) across the street escorting yet another tipsy dolly into his apartment. Lenny leaves, the mother lovingly puts her son to bed, then she goes out to a bar where she encounters none other than Jasper trying to tempt her to his lair. The needy mother submits to Jasper's intentions and in a brief moment of desire succumbs to her physical needs.Another day passes and as Lenny and their son depart for the soccer game, the mother is again willingly seduced by Jasper, only to have their assignation interrupted by an explosion at the stadium where Lenny and her son are watching the game. The guilt-ridden adulterous mother flees to the stadium where she is injured attempting to find her family. Now hospitalized with injuries she faces visits from Jasper as well as from her husband's co-worker Terrance (Matthew Macfadyen). Once released form the hospital she discovers the withheld name and picture of one of the suicide bombers responsible for the attack and deaths - and she learns that the bomber was a suspect being watched by Terrance who could possibly have prevented her loss. She learns the name of the suicide bomber's family, meets the bomber's son (Usman Khokhar) and wife (Sasha Behar) and eventually allows herself to meet them. The consequences of all of this information and chance meetings and the afterburn of her association with Jasper and Terrance (both of whom profess love for her) make for a startling ending, but an ending that for once helps us understand the psychology of our current world of terrorism threat and the need to heal and move on.The performances are excellent, with special attention paid to the gifts of Michelle Williams whose perfect British accent will be a surprise to most viewers: this is a career altering role for her. The film develops slowly, deals with a lot of internal dialog, but in the end the effect is one of powerful impact. Highly recommended.

The novel won the 2006 Somerset Maugham Award, was shortlisted for the 2006 Commonwealth Writers Prize, won the United States Book-of-the-Month Club's First Fiction award 2005 and won the Prix Sp&eacute;cial du Jury at the French Prix des Lecteurs 2007.Three years later Director Sharon Maguire, in her first movie since 2001's Bridget Jones' Diary, made this film of Cleave's book.  Michelle Williams portrays the grieving mother. Ewan McGregor and Matthew MacFadyen star as men who try to console her.  (McGregor's character at the time of the bombing was sharing an ""afternoon delight"" with her on the living room sofa.)Williams portrayal is masterful as she relives her son's short life in vivid happy snippets. She is not guilt-ridden nor revenge-seeking. She befriends the son of the bomber and his mother not for revenge but in empathy.  The photography of the beach scenes of mother and son at play and the imaginery blimp are stunning.  And the ending of the movie will haunt you for days.Generally, the film received poor professional reviews from critics.  Apparently a theme of a simple western woman who empathizes with a third world terrorist's family is too strange to grasp.  Tom Charity, after viewing the film at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, gave it one star out of five and called it an ""ambitious/opportunistic effort that misses the mark, from the one-dimensional characters to the craven plotting and sentimental tone.""Time Out gave it two stars out of six, saying ""there are so many things wrong with writer-director Sharon Maguire's film... that it's hard to know where to start, but the fatal problem is that this is a film with an 'identity crisis'; the film at times seems like a 'study of guilt and grief' and at other times a 'conspiracy thriller' but ends up being a compendium of bizarre diversions, most of which are utterly surplus to the film's half-cocked desire to stick with the experience and emotions of its main character.""  The male reviewer for Time Out apparently was bent-out-of shape that an American actress was selected to portray a ""nervy young British mother on a London council estate"" calling the casting a joke.Neither of these male film critics considered the film a character study nor noted Michelle Williams' stellar performance. She was in almost every scene!(At the time of this review...Michelle Williams has been nominated for a 2012 Golden Globe for her performance in My Week with Marilyn.

I finished the book yesterday and watched the movie today -- they are like distant cousins, one reminiscent of the other with some memories of shared experiences, but if you're looking for the book in the movie, you will be disappointed.Plot summaries abound in other reviews so I won't take the time for that. Apparently the trailer is wildly off the mark, leading one to expect an action-packed, suspenseful government cover-up -- that is unfortunate, and I am very glad I never saw a trailer.  Michelle Williams was wonderful as the grieving mother -- I cannot understand reviewers who have panned her, I thought she was really very good.  Ewan McGreggor was fine, though his character really took a back seat (Jasper Black is a COMPLETELY different person in the book) but the movie wasn't really about him, it was about the mother and her grief.  The 11-year-old boy subplot which was added I thought contributed nicely to what this movie was trying to convey -- purists hoping for a good novel-to-screen transfer will disagree, but those scenes with the boy really enriched the movie.I would definitely recommend the book -- there is a lot of black humor in the book which the scriptwriter did away with altogether -- just don't expect the book to be like the movie!",4,Don't expect it to be like the book,1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,1423,"['never', 'expect', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'be', 'true', 'book', 'indeed', 'case', 'here', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'own', 'merits', 'finished', 'book', 'yesterday', 'watched', 'movie', 'today', 'are', 'like', 'distant', 'cousins', 'one', 'reminiscent', 'other', 'memories', 'shared', 'experiences', ""'re"", 'looking', 'book', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.Plot', 'summaries', 'abound', 'other', 'reviews', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'Apparently', 'trailer', 'wildly', 'mark', 'leading', 'one', 'expect', 'action-packed', 'suspenseful', 'government', 'cover-up', 'unfortunate', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'never', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'was', 'wonderful', 'grieving', 'mother', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'panned', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'Ewan', 'McGreggor', 'was', 'fine', 'character', 'really', 'took', 'back', 'seat', 'Jasper', 'Black', 'COMPLETELY', 'different', 'person', 'book', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'was', 'mother', 'grief', '11-year-old', 'boy', 'subplot', 'was', 'added', 'thought', 'contributed', 'nicely', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'purists', 'hoping', 'good', 'novel-to-screen', 'transfer', 'will', 'disagree', 'scenes', 'boy', 'really', 'enriched', 'movie.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'book', 'lot', 'black', 'humor', 'book', 'scriptwriter', 'did', 'away', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'book', 'be', 'movie']",Incendiary

She portrays a young housewife and a mother of a 4-year old boy.  He marriage is strained by the fact that her husband works as a policeman in London's anti-terrorist unit difusing bombs.  Her lack of marital bliss is enhanced by her unconditional, unlimited love for her son who she loves more than anything or anyone in this world.On an impulse one night she has affair with a handsome, young journalist (Ewan McGregor) who also happens to live across the street from her.  On the outside these two have nothing in common.  This secret lover of hers is single, he lives in trendy London townhouse, drives fancy cars and has no commitments.  But circumstances put them together a t the moment when both her husband and son face terrible fate.  Consumed by grier, guilt and sorrow, she is trying to regain her own self.  But her transformation leads more towards emotional meltdown and insanity than peace.

I'll make this a two part review to be as fair as possible, one part on the mis-marketing and the other on the Blu-Ray product (small spoilers).The story covers loads of grief, emotions and loss as a woman (Michelle Williams) loses her son and husband in a major terrorist explosion in London. Coincidentally, she is having a tryst (with Ewan McGregor) whilst her family is killed. With extensive flashbacks of her son, coupled together with three other distinct story lines, we get spattered with some bad writing and abbreviated conclusions.Marketing: The trailer shows the only 80 seconds of activity in the whole film (outside of the sex scene). Case description: ""...and discovers the authorities will do anything to cover up the terrifying truth behind it."" Once you watch the film you realize how incorrect that statement is. Between being pushed as a thriller and my customers thinking it would be a conspiracy/semi-action film, I think one's expectations should be a little different as to alleviate any disappointment. There is lots of melancholy, sadness, beach footage, regret and a 1000 memorial blimps - not much else.The Blu looked crisp, but very little color gets used. The clarity did show a variety of errors, including blatant crew reflections in vehicles (not brief either) and the CGI failings during the one stadium sequence. The DTS gets used best during the explosion sequence but not much else except some classical music mix. No extras to speak of, except a brief photo gallery of cast and crew.There are both adequate and poor/minimal performances, a somewhat graphic sex scene that gets spoiled, and numerous shortcomings in the story that detract from what sounded like an excellent book.

Ewan McGregor plays Jasper Black, a rich newspaper reporter who has an affair with her.The British film is part character study, part mystery and part introspective drama, and succeeds as none. Not to spoil the film's ""surprises,"" I can say it is an overtly melodramatic tale told against the background of very immediate political issues. ""Incendiary"" doesn't know subtlety. With too many voiceovers that never end, and a graphic sex scene that looks out of place, the unfocused film doesn't know what it wants to do.Michelle Williams (she is top-billed) shows what a talented player can do, as a mother with unresolved grief over her loved ones (and guilt for sleeping with another man). Without her superb acting the film would have been a total mess. Ewan McGregor is underused, and so is Matthew Macfadyen Terrance Butcher in charge of the anti-terrorism division. Their underwritten characters add very little to the half-baked script.The 2008 British film, based on a 2005 book of the same title by Chris Cleave, is written and directed by Sharon Maguire, better known as the helmer of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" (2001).
