A direct rip-off of Jaws you have a big shark attacking a resort during the annual regata. It pairs well as a double feature with movies such as Tentacles.,5,The Last Shark,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,214,"['love', 'drive-in/cult', 'classics', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'direct', 'rip-off', 'Jaws', 'have', 'big', 'shark', 'attacking', 'resort', 'annual', 'regata', 'pairs', 'well', 'double', 'feature', 'movies', 'such', 'Tentacles']",The Last Shark (1981)
1442065,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00551WWT6,Einsatz,"[0, 1]","Yes, this is the movie Universal Pictures blocked from being shown in North America back in 1981.  They claimed plagiarism, specifically Jaws, as their excuse for having it banned.  The absurdity of this claim is immediately apparent the moment you watch The Last Shark (original title: Great White).  Yes, both movies are about a shark.  Beyond that, there is no comparison.  One movie is a classic; the other is a sad little wannabe.The Last Shark is about a windsurfing race to be held with full knowledge of a shark in the area.  Precautions are taken to ensure the race can take place.  They put up shark-proof netting and ring the area with armed men on boats; for good measure, they include spotters.  ""Absolutely nothing is going to happen.""  Famous last words, they hadn't counted on a sneaky shark that has the ingenuity to trap a couple of divers in a cave.........by shoving rocks in front of the opening!  This shark also does its own version of fishing.  It's hysterical, I don't know what Universal had to be afraid of, no one is ever going to confuse this movie with Jaws.As for the quality of this movie, the transfer is fine; it's a nice looking subpar movie.  Luckily, as I was in the mood for a comedy, it fit the bill perfectly.  It is unintentionally funny in all the right ways: dopey dialog, a daffy plot, and dubious acting (Vic Morrow gave it all he had while James Franciscus looked painfully uncomfortable throughout with a performance that barely registered above that of a mannequin).  As for the shark, sometimes it was a fake and sometimes they used actual footage of sharks.  The quality was inconsistent throughout, as though several filmmakers got together and each took a hand in one scene or another (without bothering to check to see what the others had done).  It had a pasted together feel to it; complete with choppy editing and abrupt scenes.As with other films of this type, the usual happens, people lose life and limb, everyone runs in panic.  The local yokels and one cowboy try to bag the killer shark (some by trolling with a side of beef!).  It was beyond dumb.  I actually liked it.  I haven't seen anything this loony since............................?Of course, it's a keeper!  Anything that makes me laugh that hard is worth keeping around.(But it is a crappy movie; make no mistake.)",4,"""You're going to walk out of this hospital!

1442066,A1906D1SZRVTF9,B00551WWT6,M.Hobin,"[0, 0]","This film seemed to borrow very heavily from previously released and very successful shark films; in particular Jaws and Jaws II.  There are fragments of Orca in the mix as well.  The sets were good, as was the use of shark footage; some of the shots of the prop shark were good and some were horrible. The cast wasn't bad, but weak character development and less than excellent writing made this film wanting.

1442068,A1441JD62UV8IR,B00551WWT6,Techy DVD Guy,"[19, 21]","So, in 1982, Film Ventures International released the mother of all Italian Sharksploitation flick's, Great White, or The Last Shark if you have seen the DVD. The film is about a 35 foot Great White shark invading the town of South Bay (Set in Savannah, Georgia). From there on, it's pretty much like Jaws, Mayor doesn't want to close the beaches, swimmers go in the water and the shark gets them.The Film itself is very good! The shark is my favorite part of 'The Last Shark', it looks MUCH better than the CGI Sharks we see in todays movies. The shark doesn't have much screen time but when it does, it's never boring! Plus, the shark roars everytime it surfaces.The music is another great part of this film. In the US, the score was composed by Morton Stevens, his score is not features on the DVD, only in the US theatrical version. The score on the DVD, is by the De Angelis brothers who never fail to make a great score. The opening song, Hollywood Big Time, is also very well done as well.Overall, I'd give the film a 9/10. I don't see why people hate this film. Sure it has some similarities to Jaws and Jaws 2, but it is much more original than anything we have seen today. Plus, the film has a better looking shark than Jaws 2, 3-D, and The Revenge.
