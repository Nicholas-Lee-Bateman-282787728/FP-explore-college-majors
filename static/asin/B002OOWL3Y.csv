1281706,AGEWC5R7T5QLY,B002OOWL3Y,"Betty Boop ""BB""","[7, 8]","One of the few sitcoms on TV I find very funny and quite witty. Seasons 1-4 TV series brings a half hour of highly enjoyable escapism. Well loved characters. Michael J Fox is the glue for the whole show. It started with him and unfortunately the show died without him.This show went off the air in 2002. If you happen to catch it in reruns, only watch the MJF episodes. I personally consider the Charlie Sheen years to be a completely different show, not worthy of comment. Michael J. Fox is a terrific actor. The supporting cast for this show were a sharp, witty team. However, for some reason the secretary Stacy was replaced by Heather Locklear. Heather really killed this show,it was almost dead even by the time MJF left. When she was added, all the other charactars were pushed to the background and we hardly ever saw them anymore. Instead, we saw a lot of Locklear interacting with Michael in a strange, contrived way. Then when Michael J. Fox left, they brought Charlie Sheen in. Charlie Sheen was awful & not suited for the role, but at this point the show was unbearable to watch because of Locklear's questionable acting abilities and the way the other cast members which had dwindled to four, counting the Mayor - were shown only once maybe twice per show. If Locklear had not been brought in and the other cast members had remained with the show, this show ""might"" have been able to survive even without Fox, although not likely as Michael J. Fox Was the show.Spin City 1 through 4 are a must watch. Loved it.",5,Spin City-Michael J.

1281709,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B002OOWL3Y,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[3, 4]","The series dynamics were changing this season (1999-2000) as campaign manager Caitlin Moore (Heather Locklear) came on board the cast. She's directing the Mayor's Senate attempt. Remembering her only from Melrose Place, T J Hooker, and Dynasty, I was impressed to discover she successfully does genuine and intentional comedy.After the Winston administration turns down the likes of James Carville (!) she is hired on.But Caitlin isn't as smooth as she sells herself as--she's bankrupted the campaign coffers (The Mayor May Not). So the Senate race is ultimately abandoned. But for some reason, Caitlin remains around City Hall, inadvertently getting into things which have nothing to do with the now-abandoned race.Despite originally wanting to find out what dirt Caitlin had on him (All the Mayor's Men) a recurring theme throughout this season becomes the office crush which the two powerful personalities have on each other.It reaches such apparent proportions that Mike even travels to Paris to stop Caitlin from getting married to another man (An American Deputy Mayor in Paris). Then our woman-crazy protagonist sincerely pledges to abstain from sex for a week (The Commitments). It will allegedly prove to Caitlin that he is serious about 'their' relationship.Mike self-realized that the thought of Caitlin dating somebody else--such as that ex-husband--drove him nuts (Suffragette City). Comedy drama between Fox and Locklear built up an actually deccent series subplot.Unfortunately, all good things come to an end. And this is the last good season of Spin City. To prevent the Mayor from inadvertently being taken down in a City Hall scandal, Mike takes the fall and resigns (Goodbye 1 & 2).This plotline provides Michael J. Fox an avenue to exit the series. And Michael Gross guest stars in the two-parter, with additional inside references to Fox's prior television series.Because I and other fans who did grow up with his work know why Fox actually left, the closing scenes remains genuinely powerful. A part of me does not believe it is acting. I do believe it is Fox the person, frustrated by this point in his life.Please do yourself a favor and do not purchase subsequent seasons of this series; they will not at all be the same quality. You're going to notice a big difference. For all intents and purposes, Spin City essentially ended with this season",5,"Hello Heather, Goodbye Mike",1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,2371,"['series', 'dynamics', 'were', 'changing', 'season', '1999-2000', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Caitlin', 'Moore', 'Heather', 'Locklear', 'came', 'board', 'cast', 'directing', 'Mayor', 'Senate', 'attempt', 'Remembering', 'only', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'T', 'J', 'Hooker', 'Dynasty', 'was', 'impressed', 'discover', 'successfully', 'genuine', 'intentional', 'comedy.After', 'Winston', 'administration', 'down', 'likes', 'James', 'Carville', 'hired', 'on.But', 'Caitlin', ""n't"", 'as', 'smooth', 'bankrupted', 'campaign', 'coffers', 'Mayor', 'May', 'Not', 'Senate', 'race', 'ultimately', 'abandoned', 'reason', 'Caitlin', 'City', 'Hall', 'inadvertently', 'getting', 'things', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'now-abandoned', 'race.Despite', 'originally', 'wanting', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'dirt', 'Caitlin', 'had', 'Mayor', 'Men', 'recurring', 'theme', 'season', 'office', 'crush', 'two', 'powerful', 'personalities', 'have', 'other.It', 'such', 'apparent', 'proportions', 'Mike', 'even', 'Paris', 'stop', 'Caitlin', 'getting', 'married', 'man', 'American', 'Deputy', 'Mayor', 'Paris', 'Then', 'woman-crazy', 'protagonist', 'sincerely', 'abstain', 'sex', 'week', 'Commitments', 'will', 'allegedly', 'prove', 'Caitlin', 'serious', 'relationship.Mike', 'self-realized', 'thought', 'Caitlin', 'dating', 'somebody', 'else', 'such', 'ex-husband', 'drove', 'nuts', 'Suffragette', 'City', 'Comedy', 'drama', 'Fox', 'Locklear', 'built', 'up', 'actually', 'deccent', 'series', 'subplot.Unfortunately', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'end', 'last', 'good', 'season', 'Spin', 'City', 'prevent', 'Mayor', 'inadvertently', 'being', 'taken', 'down', 'City', 'Hall', 'scandal', 'Mike', 'fall', 'resigns', 'Goodbye', '1', '2', '.This', 'plotline', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'avenue', 'exit', 'series', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'guest', 'stars', 'two-parter', 'additional', 'inside', 'references', 'Fox', 'prior', 'television', 'series.Because', 'other', 'fans', 'who', 'did', 'grow', 'up', 'work', 'know', 'why', 'Fox', 'actually', 'left', 'closing', 'scenes', 'genuinely', 'powerful', 'part', 'not', 'believe', 'acting', 'do', 'believe', 'Fox', 'person', 'frustrated', 'point', 'life.Please', 'do', 'favor', 'do', 'not', 'purchase', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'series', 'will', 'not', 'all', 'be', 'same', 'quality', ""'re"", 'going', 'notice', 'big', 'difference', 'intents', 'purposes', 'Spin', 'City', 'essentially', 'ended', 'season']",N/A

The producer of this show must of known something because Heather Locklear does  a tremendous job at comedy in this series. She basically takes over the show after a few episodes.
