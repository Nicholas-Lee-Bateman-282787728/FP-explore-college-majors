1499393,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B005S9EJ8W,,"[12, 26]","Some SPOILER ALERTS though it doesn't really matter since the movie is ""spoiled"" to begin with.  Speaking of ""begin"" I'll start at the end.  If I walked into the theatre whilst the credits were rolling I would have thought I was coming in on a James Bond movie.  What's with the banal, Bondish song?  Who knows?  But then again there is a lot in this flick that makes no sense. For one thing, where did the villain get the money or the time to build a gigantic pendulum to dispatch a single victim, just so as to entice and embroil Poe in his preposterous, impossible plot? Why does Poe have a pet raccoon when cats were his feline muses? Why is the final Parisian scene more convincing in its depiction of a city than anything in the rest of the Baltimore-based film?  Why does a newspaper refer to a ""Serial Killer"" when the phrase wasn't even used in those days?  Why is this movie called THE RAVEN anyway? Why does Poe as played by John Cusack have a goatee?  Why doesn't Poe as played by John Cusack speak with a Southern accent? It isn't enough for an actor to put on the period clothes; he must be able to get into the character's skin!  Of course the script wasn't much for Mr. Cusack to sink his teeth in - but I never felt for one scintilla of a second that Cusack's Poe could ever actually write anything of literary value anyhow.This is just one of the many tragic sadnesses in the life and afterlife of poor Edgar Allan Poe: no one has ever made a good movie about him and his life.  Sylvester Stallone pondered the project which was to be based on his own contemporaneous-with ROCKY long-buried script - and Robert Downey Jr. was highly considered for the lead. Now Robert Downey Jr. would be the perfect Poe.  He looks much more like him that Cusack - and he is a much better actor.  Downey also had his own mind-twisting addictions and demons to battle - and all of his own personal torments might have added dark dimensions to his scheduled and then scrapped portrayal.  Probably, even in a film by Sly! But what happens in the culturally crippled world of most movies nowadays?  Instead, THE RAVEN gets made - and the true story of Edgar Allan Poe doesn't.  Yet - for anyone who knows anything about the Divine Edgar - his actual story is more exciting, more intense, more horrifying than anything to be found in this movie.  And instead of someone somewhere utilizing the true thespic talents of Robert Downey Jr. - in a Poe biopic for example! - where do we find Mr. Downey instead?  In multi-million dollar, CGI intensive, cinematic comic books!  Or as a souped-up, James Bondish Sherlock Holmes who has very little in common with Conan Doyle's actual creation.And the world has this to look forward to: soon a great many of ill-informed movie goers will be clued in as to the true scoop story of Abraham Lincoln.  Yes, it isn't enough that arguably the greatest President we ever had held the country together during the Civil War and ended up abolishing slavery - no, there was much more! Old Abe was, in fact, a Vampire Hunter!  At least audiences will have Spielberg's Lincoln biopic to look forward to as an antidote. But not so, it appears, with poor Edgar Poe.Back to THE RAVEN.  This movie had two big things potentially going for it.  It could have been a truly insightful portrait of Poe and offered viewers a truly mystifying mystery.  But it does neither.  It fails as history and it fails as mystery. Anyhow, I doubt if even Vincent Price could have saved this flick.",1,POE?

Initially, it paused during the producing company's logos but the movie itself played smoothly.After watching the trailer this presented itself as a Sherlock Holmes-style thriller. Overall, the movie is well-done. If you like Cusack (the reason why this was a must to watch for me) then this fits right into other performances and patterns of his movies. The costumes were appropriate as were the settings/scenery.Now, the plot felt a bit shallow and I would have walked away and come back to it had I not paid $4.99 for the rental (the famous ""Box"" does not have the Bluray just yet). I did like the ending/last few minutes and thought that they were creative. Would I watch it again? Most likely not. And, I would not by the DVD/Bluray on sale either.However, if you like Cusack and are a big fan, you should -- without question -- watch this movie.

1499400,A2MR43RDPZX3J,B005S9EJ8W,Applewhite Minyard,"[0, 0]","This is not a story about Edgar Allan Poe, nor is it a story about Poe's most famous creation, &#34;The Raven.&#34; It is entirely fictitious and turns Poe into a sort of modern day detective. It is true that Poe also created the blueprint for all detective stories to follow with his &#34;Murders in the Rue Morgue&#34; and other stories featuring August Dupin, but the screenwriters here don't make any attempt to illuminate the actual Poe, his relationship with his wife and her mother, his publishers, his contemporaries, or even the circumstances surrounding his death. There are a few lines on the screen that proclaim his mysterious death, but the movie doesn't really explore this. He was found, in someone else's clothing, near death and never recovered. The events that caused his death have never been ascertained, but the most logical guess is he was part of an election vote stealing. He was plied with drink and taken to several polling places (in different clothes) to vote several times. This was a common practice at the time, and Poe, despite popular conception, was not a drunkard. He had an extreme sensitivity to alcohol, almost an allergic reaction. So, giving him too much to drink would essentially kill him.His life was complex, his personality was difficult to deal with, but his genius was unmistakable. This movie does nothing to advance our knowledge of Poe the person or Poe the artist or even the mystery of Poe's death.It is heavy on atmostphere and the story itself is rather entertaining, as long as you don't try to place the actual Poe in it.

The inclusion of cartoon gore, a hot chick with a rack that looks great in a corset, and soap-opera worthy dialogue will appeal to ADD kids whose Red Bull infused minds could never handle the 1845 epic poem. The director had so much fun, he lets the killer best our hero in an inevitable climax that ends right where our journey begins. Fortunately, someone from the production department must have intervened to cut this stupid tale short before it sets itself up for a sequel that would do a similar disservice to Jules Verne.In the same way that Vin Diesel copied Arnold with his entry into the bad kiddie movie genre (The Pacifier (Widescreen Edition)vs.Kindergarten Cop), Cusack brings us a campy rehash of Johnny Depp's opiate odyssey,From Hell [Blu-ray]. I liked both films for the same reasons: intricate Victorian set pieces offset by very gothic undertones. What ""The Raven"" fails to capture is Poe's underlying addiction that served as the blueprint to his real-life demise. ""From Hell"" portrays this to a maximum effect through its opium-addled anti-hero, Police Inspector Abberline. The Raven as a whole, is a fun ride.

There is so much material for a good movie in Poe's life. I love the idea of exploring Poe as a character, the relation between his fiction and his life, or his strange and mysterious death. There is just so much material there, I just do not think this movie really made anything all that interesting out of it. This is essentially your standard serial killer on the loose flick, including the kidnapped loved interest, the hidden clues, and the ticking clock. This story could have been told without referencing Poe at all, and it would have remained essentially the same story.I have nothing against the premise of this movie. A serial killer is using Poe's stories as inspiration for real murders. A detective recognizes that fact, and brings Poe in on the case. The idea of the film is not really all that original, anyone who watches procedurals on a regular basis will recognize this familiar plot (Castle?), but I was willing to forgive the unoriginality of the premise, because I was looking forward to seeing Poe on screen. I was hoping that Poe's presence would turn a familiar premise into something more interesting. Unfortunately, I do not feel like I got to see Poe on screen. I saw a character who happened to share the same name as Edgar Allan Poe, but I never saw Edgar Allan Poe.The character in this movie, whose name was Edgar Allan Poe, is a character I have seen in many movies before. The alcoholic writer, the playful trickster, who attempts to woo a girl under the disapproving eyes of her father. This is one of Hollywood's most familiar tropes, and I was really disappointed to see Poe reduced to such a trope. This is a character that I have seen in at least a half a dozen movies before. It just so happens that, in this movie, this familiar character was named Edgar Allan Poe. Poe was a real historical character, and a very interesting character. I do not feel like the writers were really up to the task of portraying such an interesting and complex character. I realize this is a tall order. Anyone who has read Poe will certainly have formed some image of what they think he must have been like as a person. A lot of those images, including, perhaps, my own, are probably not very accurate. It is possible that my disappointment is based simply on the fact that the Poe I saw on screen failed to match the image that I have formed of Poe based on my reading of his stories, and what I have read about him, but let me give some examples of where I felt this movie failed in its depiction of the Poe I imagine, and readers of my review can make up their own mind whether they agree with me or not.There is a scene where Poe is with the police detective and a number of other police officers at the scene of a crime that is a recreation of Poe's story ""The Pit and the Pendulum"". The police detective says something like ""There is a logic to what this killer does"" and Poe responds by saying something like ""Anyone who could cut someone in half is not operating based on logic"" (with audible moral condemnation in his voice). To me this is such a trite sentiment. This simplistic, moralistic, attitude towards the dark side of human nature, seems totally out of place from the person who wrote ""Imp of the Perverse"", ""The Black Cat"", and ""The Tell-Tale Heart"". Poe spent a great deal of time in his stories dissecting the psychology of killers and the deranged, and his killers were often exceedingly logical people. They were meticulous planners. I just refuse to believe that Poe, with all of his personal experience and insight into the darker side of human nature, would give into such simplistic moralism.There are so many places where Poe expresses himself in trite formulas, or Hollywoodisms, in this movie. I just cannot stand to hear Hollywoodisms like ""If I could I would dance with you throughout time"" or ""I would gladly give my life for hers"" coming out of the mouth of Edgar Allan Poe. I also do not feel like the film did a very good job portraying Poe's darkness and melancholy. Poe gives a speech, at one point, about a melancholy that has followed him throughout his life, but it is a sign of bad writing when a character has to literally tell you about their melancholy. We should be able to hear it in the way they speak, see it in their actions, and see it on their face. We should not have to be told that Poe is melancholy, we should feel it, without having to be told. The audience does not feel Poe's melancholy in this move. The Poe that I saw on screen was almost entirely devoid of angst. And to make matters worse, he gives into another Hollywoodism by saying that his melancholy followed him all of his life ""until I met Emily"". It is another Hollywoodism to imagine that deep, clinical, depression can be cured by love. The Poe that I imagine would be disgusted by that kind of sentimentality. I realize that Poe wrote love poems, but even those love poems were tinged with melancholy and the awareness of mortality.I have focused mostly on the portrayal of Poe the character because that is the aspect of the film I was most disappointed with. But what about the story? The story, as I already said, was pretty pedestrian. It is a story I have seen many times before. A serial killer is on the loose, he wants to play games with someone he claims to admire, he kidnaps someone they love to raise the stakes, and the hunt is on. The presence of Poe allows the writers to base each murder on a Poe story, but that is really all that separates this movie from any other serial killer movie or procedural on television. The movie does attempt, in its own way, to solve the mystery of Poe's death, but it leaves so much out of its account, that its ""solution"" is not really that interesting on its own, and feels tacked on. The fact that the writers leave out some of the most interesting mysteries about Poe's death (why was he wearing someone else's clothes?) suggests that providing a fictionalized explanation for Poe's mysterious death was never really their primary intention. If it had been their primary intention, I think they might have made a more interesting movie (think ofAmadeus - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition), which was based on the death bed ""confession"" of Antonio Salieri).Those who are simply looking for a standard serial killer chase film will probably find much to enjoy in this movie, as long as they are not expecting anything too original. Anyone who is coming to this movie out of a love for Poe, and a desire to see him on screen, is likely to be disappointed.",2,Poor Mr. Poe...,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,6837,"['almost', 'never',

As a matter of fact, I still think that he was the best writer ever; yeah, even better than ""that"" guy.  (I can hear names thrown about such as Mark Twain and Shakespeare.  Mr. Poe's writing is still readable today, even though I was a fan of Mr. Twain's when I was a kid as well.)  And I've been a big fan of John Cusack's as well.  The movie ""High Fidelity"" is one of my favorites of the genre, and I really like Mr. Cusack's style, skill, and likability overall.So, it makes sense that I liked ""The Raven"" as a movie, where many of the critics appeared to have not.  I don't know exactly why they don't like it yet; I tend to avoid reading reviews before watching any film because it taints the experience for me.  But ""Raven"" reminds me of ""The Da Vinci"" code if that movie were watchable, not to dis on Tom Hanks.  It was just too conspiracy-theory for my tastes, where Raven takes history, adds a little bit of conjecture (hey, the writer of the screenplay for sure knew it was highly unlikely himself) and make it just plain more fun.The one thing that this film did make me do:  do some research about Mr. Poe's life.  I read a little bit last night after viewing, read about some things that I didn't know before.  Many of the true pieces of his life are in this film and so that adds to the fun.  While I have read a majority of Mr. Poe's work, I do wish that I would have known some of these personal things before watching; now that would be a recommendation to you.Other that those minor factoids, did any of this stuff really happen in real life?  Probably not.  But I still give this movie a recommendation for a viewing.  After all, I was entertained and this film was entertaining.

In that film you come to care for the characters and see them as more than just hookers or addicts, plus the suspense and terror is satisfyingly good and doesn't weigh down a well-written story.Here we have John Cusack playing Edgar Allen Poe in an overly Nicholas cage reaching way that's downright cloying.  The worst part of it is that Poe wasn't a ranting, raving lunatic spouting off poetic verbiage in the middle of the rest of cast using language from our time.  About the only things that were accurate in this awful movie were the facts that he was penniless and a drunk.  As someone else here stated, why must we put real historical figures in ridiculous situations that transform them into Han Solo action figures.  Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter?  Poe as a criminal investigator?  What's next, are they going to put Mark Twain in a cape and have him fly around the Mississippi in search of killers?That's not even the worst of it.  ""Serial Killer"" is splashed on the front page of the paper, and I thought it was hilarious.  That term wasn't USED back then.  We also get the pleasure of witnessing fake blood flying around as a swinging hatchet slices a writer in half.  Talk about your hatchet jobs.  Then there is the problem with having to see Poe is madly in love with, not Virginia, but Bugs Bunny in a dress (Alice Eve) who is very pretty but has yet to prove she is worthy of the term ""actress.""  I haven't seen her in one good movie yet.  Come to think of it, Cusack hasn't been batting a thousand with his role choices lately either, and this is no exception.  We also have the most disappointing killer in the world by the time this 150 minute mess that feels like its 150 hours rolls to a close.  Best of all, when the closing credits roll, there is some oddly mismatched music that doesn't fit the movie at all.  Then again, virtually everything about this fiasco is out of place.Yes, alas, poe Edgar.  Your name has been used to further somebody else's career and financial status.

John Cusack stars as the ill-fated author, although he often lacks the strength and conviction to carry the film. This rendition of Poe seems less tortured and more focused on melodramatics and snappy retorts, though none will accuse the film of attempting to be an accurate portrayal of the man, himself. James McTeigue paints a stylish thriller that resembles the likes of FROM HELL or SLEEPY HOLLOW in its dark Gothic allure. Poe aficionados will appreciate the delicate interlacing of clues that tie several of the author's most famed stories together while piecing together the killer's grand scheme. Where THE RAVEN mainly falters is in creating any real suspense to lock us in our seats as the murders unfold.

It's a shame such an elegant idea wasn't given a better batch of actors to work with.The critics panned this film upon its release and unfortunately it's not hard to see why. The idea is ingenious but the way it plays out isn't. Everything should work but doesn't... the lovely costumes, the terrific supporting cast (made up of well-known British talent), the thunderous score, and a tight script full of humor and morbidity. It draws upon many of Poe's better and lesser known works but isn't entirely solid on its conclusions; the revelation of the murderer's identity isn't explored enough to make sense of it (why do it?) although the film does get vengeance in the end. It felt like a missed opportunity, in part because the main leads have no workable chemistry together -- neither Fields and Poe, nor Poe and Emily have any energy on screen, and three lackluster performances put together doesn't help the movie reach its conclusion.Cusack is terrible here; he looks the part but approaches the material without the sense of morbid humor and energy it requires. Eve sounds as if she's memorized her lines, never varying her tone or bringing much likability to Emily. It's a shame, because there are elements in the script that could have been worked with, to flesh out these characters... like Poe's pet raccoon, or the farce he and Emily undertake in front of her gun-toting father.

Almost as good as his portrayal of John Berendt in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  Here, Cusack plays the renowned Edgar Allen Poe.Please remember that this is not a biography.  These are not actual events based on the life of Edgar Allen Poe.  The plot is heavily influenced by his works, but Poe himself did not write this story.  Nor did he live through the events depicted in the movie.The time is 19th century Baltimore, Poe's time.  A brutal serial killer is on a rampage, killing his victims in gruesome ways.  Ways that mimic events from Edgar Allen Poe's short stories.  The victims are killed in such a manner as to parallel those in the stories.  At this time, Poe is a struggling writer.  Although highly admired for his imaginative talents, he is not financially well-rewarded.  He writes for the city newspaper, entertaining the readership with his short stories.  The killer is evidently an admirer and challenged the Baltimore police to solve the puzzle.  The chief detective on the case, Emmett Fields, enlists the help of the writer.  The two men work together to solve the mystery as the body count starts to rise.This is another one of the year's good movies.  As I said, John Cusack was good in the role.  Luke Evans is equally good as the Baltimore detective, Emmett Fields.  I also liked the ever-present ravens in the movie.  Even Poe's all black suit and black cloak remind one of a raven.  His long, dark hair and dark facial hair also are symbolic of a raven.  With his billowing dark cloak, you almost expect him to fly.  This movie has a very dark tone.  There is not one scene of a shiny, cheerful day.  Most of the day scenes are shrouded in thick fog.  There is a atmosphere of menace in just about every scene.This is not even close to a biography of Poe.  But I see this movie as still having value.  Hopefully, this movie will ignite people's curiosity about Edgar Allen Poe.  I can see a lot of people browsing the internet to read ""The Raven"" right after watching the movie.  And for those literary types, this one just might make you dust off your copies of ""The Tell-Tale Heart"", ""The Cask of Amontillado"", and ""The Pit and the Pendulum"".

1499435,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B005S9EJ8W,CriticNic,"[0, 0]","Being a fan of the works of Edgar Allen Poe, I was naturally interested in the fictional tale of the last days of the iconic horror writer's life. The film stars John Cusack as Poe, a natural choice with his dark features and ability capture dark and neurotic characters. Cusack never disappoints me even if the film itself isn't great, he's just one of those character actors that always delivers a performance.The story follows Poe as he's suddenly thrown into a sick and twisted game involving a murderer obsessed with Poe's writing, so much to the point he models his brutal killings after Edgar's stories. Things get personal when the killer kidnaps Poe's love Emily (Alice Eve) and forces Poe to take part in his game in order to get her back. Poe works with inspector Fields (Luke Evans) to track down the killer before its too late.There's something cool about taking historical figures and making them dangerous and exciting heroes. Much like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, the film has that kind of fantasy element that brings a special type of enjoyment due to it involving a real person. I think we want to believe that behind the scenes, they really were heroes. This film does a good job of building up Poe as a brilliant yet troubled genius who's a natural detective.Cusack seems natural as Poe, although his portrayal didn't exactly meet my expectations. When I think of Edgar Allen Poe I always imagine a quiet, modest man that keeps mainly to himself. I could be way off, but that's just how I would picture the man behind such dark and gruesome writings. Cusack's Poe on the other hand is often boisterous and a bit full of himself. This could very well be accurate, but this was one of the few aspects of the film that caught me off guard and made it feel a bit over the top at times.The film very much reminded me of Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey Jr. from the pacing, set and costume designs, to the lead characters both self-aware know-it-alls who mask many of their personal demons. The movie also paints Poe as more of a detective than a writer. Whether or not Poe was ever really involved in murders or other real-life crimes resembling his stories, the film makes me want to believe he was.I highly enjoyed this film when I saw it in the theater, and upon watching again on Blu-ray, I still do. I love the way the writing is incorporated into the story, and how it manages to be an original story while also tying in many real aspects of Poe's life. Even though bits of the writing seemed to have been trying too hard to make Cusack's Poe speak poetically the majority of the time, the film was very nicely played out and looked great. The story was even a nice mystery that worked well with the source material and made Edgar Allen Poe only seem that much cooler.Source: criticnic.com 12 October 2012Disclosure: Film sent by 20th Century Fox",4,Surprisingly entertaining,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,2875,"['Being', 'fan', 'works', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'was', 'naturally', 'interested', 'fictional', 'tale', 'last', 'days', 'iconic', 'horror', 'writer', 'life', 'film', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Poe', 'natural', 'choice', 'dark', 'features', 'ability', 'capture', 'dark', 'neurotic', 'characters', 'Cusack', 'never', 'even', 'film', ""n't"", 'great', 'just', 'one', 'character', 'actors', 'always', 'performance.The', 'story', 'Poe', 'suddenly', 'thrown', 'sick', 'twisted', 'game', 'involving', 'murderer', 'obsessed', 'Poe', 'writing', 'so', 'much', 'point', 'models', 'brutal', 'killings', 'Edgar', 'stories', 'Things', 'get', 'personal', 'when', 'killer', 'Poe', 'love', 'Emily', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'forces', 'Poe', 'take', 'part', 'game', 'order', 'get', 'back', 'Poe', 'inspector', 'Fields', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'track', 'down', 'killer', 'too', 'something', 'cool', 'taking', 'historical', 'figures', 'making', 'dangerous', 'exciting', 'heroes', 'Much', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'film', 'kind', 'fantasy', 'element', 'special', 'type', 'enjoyment', 'due', 'involving', 'real', 'person', 'think', 'want', 'believe', 'scenes', 'really', 'were', 'heroes', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'building', 'up', 'Poe', 'brilliant', 'yet', 'troubled', 'genius', 'who', 'natural', 'detective.Cusack', 'natural', 'Poe', 'portrayal', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'meet', 'expectations', 'When', 'think', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'always', 'imagine', 'quiet', 'modest', 'man', 'mainly', 'could', 'be', 'way', 'just', 'how', 'would', 'picture', 'man', 'such', 'dark', 'gruesome', 'writings', 'Cusack', 'Poe', 'other', 'hand', 'often', 'boisterous', 'bit', 'full', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'accurate', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'aspects', 'film', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'made', 'feel', 'bit', 'top', 'times.The', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'reminded', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'pacing', 'set', 'costume', 'designs', 'lead', 'characters', 'self-aware', 'know-it-alls', 'who', 'mask', 'many', 'personal', 'demons', 'movie', 'also', 'Poe', 'more', 'detective', 'writer', 'not', 'Poe', 'was', 'ever', 'really', 'involved', 'murders', 'other', 'real-life', 'crimes', 'resembling', 'stories', 'film', 'want', 'believe', 'was.I', 'highly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', 'watching', 'again', 'Blu-ray', 'still', 'do', 'love', 'way', 'writing', 'incorporated', 'story', 'how', 'be', 'original', 'story', 'also', 'tying', 'many', 'real', 'aspects', 'Poe', 'life', 'Even', 'bits', 'writing', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'Cusack', 'Poe', 'speak', 'poetically', 'majority', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'nicely', 'played', 'out', 'looked', 'great', 'story', 'was', 'even', 'nice', 'mystery', 'worked', 'well', 'source', 'material', 'made', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'only', 'seem', 'that', 'much', 'cooler.Source', 'criticnic.com', '12', 'October', '2012Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox']",N/A

1499437,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005S9EJ8W,C. Sawin,"[8, 12]","John Cusack is awesome. Or at least he used to be. I'm guilty of loving his ventures into thriller and horror like Identity and 1408, but haven't been a big fan of his recent efforts. 2012 was a complete mess and Hot Tub Time Machine was kind of okay at best. Since he was working with James McTeigue (director of V For Vendetta) and was set to play Edgar Allen Poe (what horror fan doesn't like Poe?), I was hoping for a movie that was at least entertaining. But then early reviews started coming out and they were more than a little negative. Its poor rating on Rotten Tomatoes didn't exactly whet my appetite and the lousy attendance of fellow movie critics at the screening (there was one other Houston critic there other than me) only made matters worse. Was there any way that people were wrong? Maybe its greatness just flew over their heads. I wish I could give you a reason to go into this with a positive mindset, but it's really hard with what lies within The Raven.Edgar Allen Poe's most well-known and gruesomely horrific tales are brought to life in Baltimore by an unknown killer. But in the meantime, let's see how poor and drunk Poe gets on a daily basis. The first half of the movie is devoted to showing what a has-been Poe has become. He's lost his inspiration, he can't get published, and nobody in Baltimore really cares about him or his work. Poe is pathetic as he's seen groveling for a drink, ranting to the newspaper editor, and attempting to keep Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) in his life. But as the killer's carnage is revealed to be inspired by Poe's works, he's dragged into the investigation by Detective Fields (Luke Evans) and somehow becomes the hero of the story.John Cusack tries really hard to make The Raven somewhat decent. His portrayal of Poe is the best part of the movie. But everything around him is so flat and preposterous that you can't appreciate it. Some of the camera techniques are intriguing as well like the way the camera goes into and comes out of a keyhole at the beginning of the movie.Unfortunately, there aren't any other favorable qualities for The Raven. Luke Evans was trying too hard to do a Michael Shannon impression with Christian Bale's scruffy Batman voice and I swear all I see when I look at Alice Eve is rabbit teeth. The Raven is unintentionally hilarious though. Griswold's (John Warnaby) pleas for his life while being strapped into the pendulum contraption are so bad they're humorous. There's the tunnel scene with the whistle blowing and shouting of ""EMILY!"" that was just awkward. The most ridiculous is the horse chase scene though. Detective Fields is shot and Poe decides to go after the killer himself. Should I send one of my best men after the killer? Nah. An alcoholic who's lost everything and isn't thinking clearly is the much better option. The line Fields yells is one of the worst in the movie. ""After him, Poe! GO!""The Raven is very slow moving and once it gets going it isn't very satisfying. The first big trap is the pendulum sequence, which is bogged down by really shady computer effects. The trap was executed more efficiently in Saw V. Really iffy CG is sprinkled throughout The Raven though whether it's something as simple as fog covering the cobblestone streets of Baltimore or a drop of blood falling from the beak of a computer generated raven or adding effects to an elaborate trap from Poe's repertoire. That's the other thing. These killings are supposed to be inspired by the works of Poe, but most people die from a simple cut to the throat or the wrists. The creative side of one of the most brilliant minds in horror has been thrown out for something much more simple-minded.The Raven is an excessive mess that would leave Edgar Allen Poe chewing on his own eyeballs just to avoid seeing this thing if he was still alive today. It's like a combination of Saw and From Hell with John Cusack as Edgar Allen Poe as the protagonist for no other reason other than to capitalize on Poe's name. The Raven is a slow, uninspired, and miserable excuse of a thriller that can't lay claim to anything other than tarnishing one of the most influential writers the world has ever known.",2,More than a little disappointing,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,4181,"['John', 'Cusack', 'awesome', 'least', 'used', 'be', ""'m"", 'guilty', 'loving', 'ventures', 'thriller', 'horror', 'Identity', '1408', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'recent', 'efforts', '2012', 'was', 'complete', 'mess', 'Hot', 'Tub', 'Time', 'Machine', 'was', 'kind', 'okay', 'best', 'was', 'working', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'director', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'was', 'set', 'play', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'what', 'horror', 'fan', ""n't"", 'like', 'Poe', 'was', 'hoping', 'movie', 'was', 'least', 'entertaining', 'then', 'early', 'reviews', 'started', 'coming', 'out', 'were', 'more', 'little', 'negative', 'poor', 'rating', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'whet', 'appetite', 'lousy', 'attendance', 'fellow', 'movie', 'critics', 'screening', 'was', 'one', 'other', 'Houston', 'critic', 'there', 'other', 'only', 'made', 'matters', 'worse', 'Was', 'way', 'people', 'were', 'wrong', 'Maybe', 'greatness', 'just', 'flew', 'heads', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'reason', 'go', 'positive', 'mindset', 'really', 'hard', 'what', 'Raven.Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'most', 'well-known', 'gruesomely', 'horrific', 'tales', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'Baltimore', 'unknown', 'killer', 'meantime', 'let', 'see', 'how', 'poor', 'drunk', 'Poe', 'daily', 'basis', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'devoted', 'showing', 'what', 'has-been', 'Poe', 'become', 'lost', 'inspiration', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'published', 'nobody', 'Baltimore', 'really', 'work', 'Poe', 'pathetic', 'seen', 'groveling', 'drink', 'ranting', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'attempting', 'keep', 'Emily', 'Hamilton', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'life', 'killer', 'carnage', 'revealed', 'be', 'inspired', 'Poe', 'works', 'dragged', 'investigation', 'Detective', 'Fields', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'hero', 'story.John', 'Cusack', 'tries', 'really', 'hard', 'make', 'Raven', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'portrayal', 'Poe', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'everything', 'so', 'flat', 'preposterous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'camera', 'techniques', 'are', 'intriguing', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'camera', 'keyhole', 'beginning', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'are', ""n't"", 'other', 'favorable', 'qualities', 'Raven', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'do', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'impression', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'scruffy', 'Batman', 'voice', 'swear', 'see', 'when', 'look', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'rabbit', 'teeth', 'Raven', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'Griswold', 'John', 'Warnaby', 'pleas', 'life', 'being', 'strapped', 'pendulum', 'contraption', 'are', 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'humorous', 'tunnel', 'scene', 'whistle', 'blowing', 'shouting', 'EMILY', 'was', 'just', 'awkward', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'horse', 'chase', 'scene', 'Detective', 'Fields', 'shot', 'Poe', 'go', 'killer', 'Should', 'send', 'one', 'best', 'men', 'killer', 'Nah', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', ""n't"", 'thinking', 'clearly', 'much', 'better', 'option', 'line', 'Fields', 'yells', 'one', 'worst', 'movie', 'Poe', 'GO', 'Raven', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'once', 'going', ""n't"", 'very', 'satisfying', 'first', 'big', 'trap', 'pendulum', 'sequence', 'bogged', 'down', 'really', 'shady', 'computer', 'effects', 'trap', 'was', 'executed', 'more', 'efficiently', 'Saw', 'V.', 'Really', 'iffy', 'CG', 'sprinkled', 'Raven', 'something', 'as', 'simple', 'fog', 'covering', 'cobblestone', 'streets', 'Baltimore', 'drop', 'blood', 'falling', 'beak', 'computer', 'generated', 'raven', 'adding', 'effects', 'elaborate', 'trap', 'Poe', 'repertoire', 'other', 'thing', 'killings', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'inspired', 'works', 'Poe', 'most', 'people', 'die', 'simple', 'cut', 'throat', 'wrists', 'creative', 'side', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'minds', 'horror', 'been', 'thrown', 'out', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'simple-minded.The', 'Raven', 'excessive', 'mess', 'would', 'leave', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'chewing', 'own', 'eyeballs', 'just', 'avoid', 'seeing', 'thing', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'today', 'combination', 'Saw', 'From', 'Hell', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'protagonist', 'other', 'reason', 'other', 'capitalize', 'Poe', 'name', 'Raven', 'slow', 'uninspired', 'miserable', 'excuse', 'thriller', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lay', 'claim', 'anything', 'other', 'tarnishing', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'writers', 'world', 'ever', 'known']",N/A

Miscast doesn't do him service.  I'm sure it wasn't the director's attempt to try and give a historical by-the-book recreation of the life of Poe.  I know that he was way before his time when it came to introducing the element of horror into his stories, poems, etc., and he died penniless and an alocholic.  Believe me, had the writers at least tried to go there, they might have made something interesting.Instead, you get a cheap rip-off of Robert Downey and Sherlock Holmes.  It seems some meanie is killing associations of Poe via his stories, e.g. ""The Pit and the Pendleum,"" ""The Prematue Burial,"" ""The Cask of Amantillado,"" and ""Murders in the Rue Morgue.""

I've read (& own) every poem, short story, & even the 1 novel that Poe has written. His work is that of genius, despite his personal demons of alcoholism & Morphine addiction. ""The Raven"", although a fictional thriller w/ Poe as the main protagonist, is a joy for a Poe fanatic (like myself) to view because there are many factual elements woven into the story. Obviously, the premise of Poe helping the Baltimore PD hunt a serial killer whose homicides are based on the works of Poe is a fictional one. But it is in the way that John Cusak portrays Edgar Allen Poe that peaks my intrest. I've read three biographies on Poe & can say that from the accounts that I've read, Cusak's portrayal is quite accurate. Poe was arrogant, difficult to get along w/, constantly thrown out of pubs & getting into brawls in Baltimore, never tried to hide nor was ashamed of his addictions, always feeling short-changed (which indeed he was), & was, in general, very dishoveled (both physically & personally). I seen 1/2 a dozen actors play Poe & none have tapped into the personality that is described in biographical accounts as well as Cusak!As for the film, it's a taut, fast-paced thriller. For fans of Poe, I believe that it will be enjoyed to great extent. Even the fictional premise of the film is incredibly appealing to a Poe fan; a serial killer whose homicides mirror that of Poe's stories, w/ the Baltimore Police requesting the help of Poe himself.This film certainly made me dust off my Complete Works Of Poe volumes & re-read some of the greatest literature in both American & World History!",5,"Great story, acting, & great film in general!",1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,1696,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'work', 'was', 'Middle', 'School', 'was', 'almost', '22', 'years', 'ago', ""'ve"", 'read', 'own', 'poem', 'short', 'story', 'even', '1', 'novel', 'Poe', 'written', 'work', 'genius', 'personal', 'demons', 'alcoholism', 'Morphine', 'addiction', 'Raven', 'fictional', 'thriller', 'w/', 'Poe', 'main', 'protagonist', 'joy', 'Poe', 'fanatic', 'view', 'are', 'many', 'factual', 'elements', 'woven', 'story', 'Obviously', 'premise', 'Poe', 'helping', 'Baltimore', 'PD', 'hunt', 'serial', 'killer', 'homicides', 'are', 'based', 'works', 'Poe', 'fictional', 'one', 'way', 'John', 'Cusak', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'peaks', 'intrest', ""'ve"", 'read', 'three', 'biographies', 'Poe', 'can', 'say', 'accounts', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Cusak', 'portrayal', 'quite', 'accurate', 'Poe', 'was', 'arrogant', 'difficult', 'get', 'along', 'w/', 'constantly', 'thrown', 'pubs', 'getting', 'brawls', 'Baltimore', 'never', 'tried', 'hide', 'was', 'ashamed', 'addictions', 'always', 'feeling', 'short-changed', 'indeed', 'was', 'was', 'general', 'very', 'dishoveled', 'physically', 'personally', 'seen', '1/2', 'dozen', 'actors', 'play', 'Poe', 'none', 'have', 'tapped', 'personality', 'described', 'biographical', 'accounts', 'as', 'well', 'Cusak', 'film', 'taut', 'fast-paced', 'thriller', 'fans', 'Poe', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'extent', 'Even', 'fictional', 'premise', 'film', 'incredibly', 'appealing', 'Poe', 'fan', 'serial', 'killer', 'homicides', 'mirror', 'Poe', 'stories', 'w/', 'Baltimore', 'Police', 'requesting', 'help', 'Poe', 'himself.This', 'film', 'certainly', 'made', 'dust', 'off', 'Complete', 'Works', 'Poe', 'volumes', 're-read', 'greatest', 'literature', 'American', 'World', 'History']",N/A

He was later found on the streets of Baltimore, deathly ill and delirious. What happened and why he died is still a subject for debate.So ""The Raven"" tries to combine that mystery with another kind -- the serial-killer type. It's not a bad concept, and they obviously crafted the death scenes and grimy, murky Baltimore setting with care. But the pacing is as heavy as a wet sandbag, and the mystery is amateurishly cobbled together.In 19th-century Baltimore, two women are brutally murdered -- one's head is nearly severed, and the other is stuffed up a chimney. Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) recognizes the crime from ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue,"" a story by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe himself (John Cusack) is a penniless erratic mess, but Fields calls him in to help with the investigation.And in the next few days, more bodies stack up -- each one killed in a way reminiscent of a Poe story or poem. Even worse, Poe's girlfriend Emily (Alice Eve) is kidnapped during a masquerade ball, and the killer sends them taunting clues about where she is being held. Now Poe must race against time -- and even risk his own life -- to save her. Blech.I wanted to like ""The Raven."" I really, really did. And at first, it seems like a promising movie: Luke Evans is wonderfully intense, and 19th-century Baltimore is beautifully bleak, murky and foggy. And the opening scene is beautifully surreal, with Poe collapsed on a park bench as a raven spirals into the cloudy sky.Unfortunately, the plot itself is a mess. For one thing, the pacing is completely leaden. It just sort of lurches from one gory murder to the next, not really building any suspense. The closest thing we have to suspense is ""Will they save Emily?"", and frankly I didn't care if they did.And the mystery is really poorly written. There are no clues to the killer's identity until the final act. It feels like the filmmakers belatedly realized, ""Hey! The movie's almost over, and we don't have a villain! Not even any clues! Quick, choose somebody random!"" And yes, the murderer's identify will be a genuine surprise... because you won't have the faintest idea who this person is.And the character of Emily really bothered me. When he died, Poe was engaged to a beautiful widow, who was also his first childhood love. And she would have worked fine as a damsel in distress... but NOOOOOOO, they had to shoehorn in a dim blonde bimbo half his age. It feels fake and shallow.As for the acting... it's tolerable. Cusack does the dissipated, depressed Poe well, but his more energetic scenes seem horribly forced. Eve is as annoying as a fly you can't get rid of. Luke Evans turns in the finest performance as a sharp, steely-eyed young police detective, and the intensity of his acting never even wavers.""The Raven"" had some good ideas and marvelous set work, but the plot lurches and thumps like a drunken raven -- and the mystery is less than satisfying.",2,"Quoth the viewer, Nevermore (spoilers)",1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,2975,"['year', '1849', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'vanished', 'week', 'was', 'later', 'found', 'streets', 'Baltimore', 'deathly', 'ill', 'delirious', 'What', 'happened', 'why', 'died', 'still', 'subject', 'debate.So', 'Raven', 'combine', 'mystery', 'kind', 'serial-killer', 'type', 'not', 'bad', 'concept', 'obviously', 'crafted', 'death', 'scenes', 'grimy', 'murky', 'Baltimore', 'setting', 'care', 'pacing', 'as', 'heavy', 'wet', 'sandbag', 'mystery', 'amateurishly', 'cobbled', 'together.In', '19th-century', 'Baltimore', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'one', 'head', 'nearly', 'severed', 'other', 'stuffed', 'up', 'chimney', 'Detective', 'Emmett', 'Fields', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'crime', 'Murders', 'Rue', 'Morgue', 'story', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'Poe', 'John', 'Cusack', 'penniless', 'erratic', 'mess', 'Fields', 'help', 'investigation.And', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'more', 'bodies', 'stack', 'up', 'one', 'killed', 'way', 'reminiscent', 'Poe', 'story', 'poem', 'Even', 'worse', 'Poe', 'girlfriend', 'Emily', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'kidnapped', 'masquerade', 'ball', 'killer', 'taunting', 'clues', 'where', 'being', 'held', 'Now', 'Poe', 'must', 'race', 'time', 'even', 'risk', 'own', 'life', 'save', 'Blech.I', 'wanted', 'Raven', 'really', 'really', 'did', 'first', 'promising', 'movie', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'wonderfully', 'intense', '19th-century', 'Baltimore', 'beautifully', 'bleak', 'murky', 'foggy', 'opening', 'scene', 'beautifully', 'surreal', 'Poe', 'collapsed', 'park', 'bench', 'raven', 'spirals', 'cloudy', 'sky.Unfortunately', 'plot', 'mess', 'one', 'thing', 'pacing', 'completely', 'leaden', 'just', 'sort', 'lurches', 'one', 'gory', 'murder', 'next', 'not', 'really', 'building', 'suspense', 'closest', 'thing', 'have', 'suspense', 'Will', 'save', 'Emily', 'frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'did.And', 'mystery', 'really', 'poorly', 'written', 'are', 'clues', 'killer', 'identity', 'final', 'act', 'filmmakers', 'belatedly', 'realized', 'Hey', 'movie', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'villain', 'Not', 'even', 'clues', 'Quick', 'choose', 'somebody', 'random', 'yes', 'murderer', 'identify', 'will', 'be', 'genuine', 'surprise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'faintest', 'idea', 'who', 'person', 'character', 'Emily', 'really', 'bothered', 'When', 'died', 'Poe', 'was', 'engaged', 'beautiful', 'widow', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'childhood', 'love', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'fine', 'damsel', 'distress', 'NOOOOOOO', 'had', 'shoehorn', 'dim', 'blonde', 'bimbo', 'age', 'fake', 'shallow.As', 'acting', 'tolerable', 'Cusack', 'dissipated', 'depressed', 'Poe', 'well', 'more', 'energetic', 'scenes', 'seem', 'horribly', 'forced', 'Eve', 'as', 'annoying', 'fly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'rid', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'finest', 'performance', 'sharp', 'steely-eyed', 'young', 'police', 'detective', 'intensity', 'acting', 'never', 'even', 'wavers', 'Raven', 'had', 'good', 'ideas', 'marvelous', 'set', 'work', 'plot', 'lurches', 'thumps', 'drunken', 'raven', 'mystery', 'less', 'satisfying']",N/A

There are many known facts about the author/poet's life and there are almost as many aspects that are not known. In this cinematic story the writers (Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare) appear to want to explore the concept of murders based on Poe's famous stories and present these mysteries as reenactments during Poe's time - Variations on themes - and when taken with that approach in mind the film works very well (despite some significant flaws in the creation of the film as directed by James McTeigue).  The film captures the flavor of the times and the mixing of the stories between fiction and reality makes for an entertaining outing.Baltimore, 1849 and we find Poe (John Cusack) as a drunkard trying to get his works published by the local newspaper edited by Maddux (Kevin McNally). His devoted assistant is Ivan (Sam Hazeldine). In the midst of Poe's financial decline a series of murders occur, murders that appear to be copies of Poe's many stories, and the police (Detective Fields - the talented Luke Evans - and Captain Hamilton - Brendan Gleason) decide to engage Poe's help in solving them. As a side story Poe is infatuated with his boss's daughter Emily (Alice Eve) and when Emily goes missing Poe s determined to capture the serial killer, even making it known that he would trade his useless life to save Emily's life.  The remainder of the film is a chase to the finish and along the way we learn the references to many of Poe's great poems and stories.No, this is not a great film, but suspend reality and it is an entertaining mystery movie.  The cast is solid and the special effects are convincing. If the film dawdles too long over certain features it does have other saving graces. But oddly enough, the graphics and the obnoxious music chosen for the closing credits destroy the mood and make the viewer want to simply turn off the film.

Surprisingly, this is much better than many of the reviews have suggested - and definitely an improvement on the Holmes or Lincoln movies.John Cusack is a good casting choice as Poe and pretty much everyone else hits the right notes too. The music is overpowering but the production design and Budapest backdrop give it a distinct and disturbing look that would suit one of his stories. As Poe is generally considered one of the pioneers of detective fiction, it's fitting that this historical mash-up is told in the form of a detective story and for the most part it keeps the audience guessing effectively.There's enough blending of known parts of Poe's character and artistic license for the whole idea to work.

Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[0, 0]","The Raven, directed by James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) comes a fictional but somewhat accurate portrayal of Edgar Allan Poe, and of the time period when he spent his final days hunting a killer. No one really knows what happened to Poe the days before his death when he was reciting the name ""Reynolds"" over and over before his heart stopped. This movie offers one theory, and it's a very intriguing one.John Cusack plays Poe, a drunk who now sees his potential being wasted by the masses and a newspaper publisher, where some of his short stories get published. But when murders begin to happen as depicted in Poe's stories, a detective named Fields arrives to address the situation, and work with Poe to find the murderer.The Raven is, honestly, one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while. It doesn't rely on heavy visual effects, but still makes very good use of some CG (a shootout in the forest, and some nasty gore). McTeigue's directing is superb, I would even say slightly better than V for Vendetta (definitely more-so than his actionfest, Ninja Assassin). Cusack was surprisingly great as Poe, who was not necessarily the action-thriller hero you would expect, with the hero being Luke Evan's Fields, more-so. Evans was great, and while his character wasn't given a lot of background, he was still a likable and interesting character. Alice Eve was good as Poe's love interest in the film, who gets entangled in the game when she is kidnapped by the killer, giving Poe incentive to help. The musical score by Lucas Vidal was impressive, offering something that sounded like a haunting mix of Sherlock Holmes (Zimmer's score) and Knowing (Marco Beltrami). The cinematography was very good, being shot in impressive locations like Belgrade and Budapest. The script, while not award-winning, was very memorable and well-written. There were a few cheesy moments of dialogue during conversations between Brendan Gleeson's character and Cusack, but mainly the script was great at building the eerie atmosphere, and following through on a mystery that wasn't predictable.The Raven is one of the most underrated thrillers of all time, and it really should have done much better at the box office. I just hope this isn't the last time McTeigue does a period-piece thriller, because he would be great to adapt Dan Simmons's novel, Drood.",5,"A Heart-Pounding, Period-Piece Thriller",1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,2341,"['Raven', 'directed', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'fictional', 'somewhat', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'time', 'period', 'when', 'spent', 'final', 'days', 'hunting', 'killer', 'one', 'really', 'what', 'happened', 'Poe', 'days', 'death', 'when', 'was', 'reciting', 'name', 'Reynolds', 'heart', 'stopped', 'movie', 'one', 'theory', 'very', 'intriguing', 'one.John', 'Cusack', 'Poe', 'drunk', 'who', 'now', 'potential', 'being', 'wasted', 'masses', 'newspaper', 'publisher', 'where', 'short', 'stories', 'get', 'published', 'when', 'murders', 'begin', 'happen', 'depicted', 'Poe', 'stories', 'detective', 'named', 'Fields', 'address', 'situation', 'work', 'Poe', 'find', 'murderer.The', 'Raven', 'honestly', 'one', 'best', 'thrillers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', ""n't"", 'rely', 'heavy', 'visual', 'effects', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'use', 'CG', 'shootout', 'forest', 'nasty', 'gore', 'McTeigue', 'directing', 'superb', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'slightly', 'better', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'definitely', 'more-so', 'actionfest', 'Ninja', 'Assassin', 'Cusack', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'Poe', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'action-thriller', 'hero', 'would', 'expect', 'hero', 'being', 'Luke', 'Evan', 'Fields', 'more-so', 'Evans', 'was', 'great', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'lot', 'background', 'was', 'still', 'likable', 'interesting', 'character', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'was', 'good', 'Poe', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'who', 'entangled', 'game', 'when', 'kidnapped', 'killer', 'giving', 'Poe', 'incentive', 'help', 'musical', 'score', 'Lucas', 'Vidal', 'was', 'impressive', 'offering', 'something', 'sounded', 'haunting', 'mix', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'Knowing', 'Marco', 'Beltrami', 'cinematography', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'being', 'shot', 'impressive', 'locations', 'Belgrade', 'Budapest', 'script', 'not', 'award-winning', 'was', 'very', 'memorable', 'well-written', 'were', 'few', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'dialogue', 'conversations', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'character', 'Cusack', 'mainly', 'script', 'was', 'great', 'building', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'following', 'mystery', 'was', ""n't"", 'predictable.The', 'Raven', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'thrillers', 'time', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'just', 'hope', ""n't"", 'last', 'time', 'McTeigue', 'period-piece', 'thriller', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'adapt', 'Dan', 'Simmons', 'novel', 'Drood']",N/A

Police investigate a series of murders. The crime scenes are straight out of the writings of Poe.Poe had become addicted to alcohol and drugs after losing his true love, Virginia, to tuberculosis.In The Raven we find our writer, with a new love Emily Hamilton. He desires her hand in marriage but her father, Captain Hamilton, hates Poe.Everything comes together when the police and Poe suspect Hamilton to be the next victim. Instead Emily is kidnapped and it soon becomes apparent she's entombed mocking ""the Cask of Amontillado.""Poe and the police search the tunnels under the city. They discover an area of fresh brickwork, and can see what looks like a woman with blonde hair. They get to the body only to discover it's that of a sailor dressed to appear like Emily. But there is another clue.The film does reference the theory that Poe was poisoned. I found it entertaining, and quite watchable. Most critics did not. Of course, I've always liked the writing of Edgar Allan and the mystery surrounding the author.The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.

As they stand outside of the room they hear the door key click and the door is locked.  They break the door down and they find a dead woman and then they find a second young child stuffed in the chimney. Someone locked the door but they found no murderer and no way to get out of the room as the only window is nailed shut.The murder seems familiar as suddenly they remember that it is similar to a story by the famous Edgar Alan Poe.  They track Poe down and find out that he has an alibi and couldn't have done the murders.  A few days later a man is murdered in the same style as the famous Pit and the Pendulum story.  Even stranger is that the dead man and Poe had knowledge of each other and it was not a good one as the dead man was a literary critic of Poe's writing.The detective on the case believes Poe is innocent but the question is who and why do they have a serial killer on the loose who is emulating Poe's macabre stories and using them as a modus operandi for the murders....This is an excellent and suspenseful mystery story about the suspicious circumstances that surround the death of Edgar Alan Poe.  John Cusack plays Edgar Alan Poe and he does a wonderful job of portraying the character.  It is interesting fictional story about the possibilities that may have occurred around Poe's life and mysterious death.Unfortunately the movie starts slowly and in addition so much of the beginning is filmed in dark rooms and dark scenes that turn so many people off about movies.

But as the second act commences, THE RAVEN stops being about Poe, moving into a serial murder mystery.  The story demotes the Poe character to a supporting role, and THE RAVEN loses steam.I hoped THE RAVEN would get back to being about Edgar Allan Poe and forget about who done it, and while to the filmmakers' credit it never bores, this movie leaves its main character behind in the chase.  THE RAVEN reminds me of what the late critic Gene Siskal said about Paul McCartney's film GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROAD STREET: When you have someone as fascinating as McCartney, why waste the opportunity with fiction when you could instead just portray him being him?THE RAVEN might be better if, instead of introducing us to Edgar Allan Poe and then taking the spotlight off him, it would be either just a work about Poe or a serial killer mystery where the star is, say, an English scholar who helps police crack a case when it appears the perpetrator is a Poe fanatic.",3,"Joseph P.

It really works well as a mystery/thriller, with several clues and action sequences throughout- this is also complimented by its fairly fast pace. The ending of the film was also great, although a scene or two make the killer's identity a bit too obvious. The special effects were great most of the time, especially during the aftermath/investigations. However, the film does use computer-generated blood during scenes with excessive amounts, and I do not like this; I felt like it was out of place and hurt the immersion of the film.

1499500,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B005S9EJ8W,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[34, 41]","""The Raven"", a fictional horror thriller featuring the non-fictional literary figure Edgar Allan Poe, was well crafted and never less than adequately watchable, but I really expected more.  While calling the film cartoony and childish would be way too critical, I thought there was a broadness and simplicity to the proceedings that made the movie veer away from some potentially very interesting waters.I'm just thinking aloud here, but I would have loved to see a fictional Poe film set in the months prior to his death in 1849, one that made a genuine attempt at showing viewers what Poe was like, what demons bedeviled him, that sort of thing.  The device of the fictional detective story involving Poe could have illuminated the non-fictional aspects of his life, aspects that contributed to his tragic, premature death.But, no, here we get a sanitized, generally likable Poe with only the barest nods to the man's excesses, depression, and hardships. To be fair here, the film at least mentions that Poe lost his young wife to tuberculosis and that the tragedy still haunted him. But not all that much, according to this movie.  There also isn't much grittiness or realism in the depiction of Baltimore in 1849, even though numerous crime scenes in bad parts of town are depicted.  There was more moody darkness in the Robert Downey Jr. ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies.Finally, worse than the broadness evident in the depictions of characters and locations, the movie didn't even give poor Poe the dignity of his inherent flaws when it came to his death.  In other words, flattering or not, Poe's demons and weaknesses were part of who he was and why he died, and that should have been shown in the movie.  But, no, here we are given a contraption-like plot development (I won't get more specific in case you're planning to see the film) that's responsible for Poe dying.  What bothered me about that?  Well, it's not so much that the plot contrivance painted Poe and his demise in a better light (to the point of making him downright heroic, in fact); it's just that, in the end, the revisionist history seemed somehow... disrespectful.  Let the poor man have his demons and weaknesses.Plusses?  The movie's production design was lavish; the death traps built by the mysterious killer were suitably creepy; there's generous discussion and quoting of Poe's work (especially his poetry); John Cusack did a good job (given the limitations of the script's approach to Poe's character); and I strangely admired the film's willingness to present no-holds-barred gore and violence.

There have been lots of theories as to what Poe died of, from tuberculosis, rabies or to a drunken bender. ""The Raven"" puts forth a more romantic theory and a detective story for the man who invented the modern detective novel.""The Raven"" as a movie demonstrates that you can make a movie that bridges the biographical facts of Poe's life and its own artistic vision and still make an interesting movie. The movie is driven by the premise, a serial killer starts a series of killings in Baltimore that emulate some of the more gruesome murders in Poe's stories. When the first murder is done inside a locked room, police detective Fields (Luke Evans) recognizes it as the setting of an Edgar Allan Poe story. Fields brings in Poe (John Cusack) at first as suspect, but when another murder occurs Poe quickly becomes the first criminal profiler and consultant. Poe helps Fields both in what kind of mind the killer may have and of course in the details from his stories. The killer kidnaps Poe's girlfriend Emily (Alice Eve) with the killer promising clues as to Emily's whereabouts with each new murder he commits.The filmmakers, director James McTeigue and writers Ben Livingstone and Hannah Shakespeare don't try to recast Poe's character as a superhero or give the movie Poe attributes that the real Poe didn't or couldn't possess. As mentioned before, the filmmakers stick fairly accurately to the known elements of Poe's last few days, although there are some artistic liberties taken, and they still present an entertaining movie with a few twists and turns as to who the murderer is.Cusack is spot on as Poe from his look, thin with a black mustache and goatee, to (more importantly) Poe's character. Poe was a writer who had the ultimate confidence in his own abilities as a writer and was dismissive of his contemporaries, especially if they were more successful. Cusack is supported by a cast that hits every note right.If you think a movie about Edgar Allan Poe won't have enough action for you, this is a movie for you. If you're more literary minded and think this movie will have too many inaccuracies or violate Poe's character or will throw in too much action, you won't be disappointed.",4,Literary or Thriller Fans This Movie is For You!,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,2326,"['October', '3', '1849', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'was', 'found', 'wandering', 'streets', 'Baltimore', 'delirious', 'calling', 'out', 'name', 'Reynolds', 'have', 'been', 'lots', 'theories', 'what', 'Poe', 'died', 'tuberculosis', 'rabies', 'drunken', 'bender', 'Raven', 'forth', 'more', 'romantic', 'theory', 'detective', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'invented', 'modern', 'detective', 'novel', 'Raven', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'biographical', 'facts', 'Poe', 'life', 'own', 'artistic', 'vision', 'still', 'make', 'interesting', 'movie', 'movie', 'driven', 'premise', 'serial', 'killer', 'series', 'killings', 'Baltimore', 'emulate', 'more', 'gruesome', 'murders', 'Poe', 'stories', 'When', 'first', 'murder', 'done', 'locked', 'room', 'police', 'detective', 'Fields', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'setting', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'story', 'Fields', 'brings', 'Poe', 'John', 'Cusack', 'first', 'suspect', 'when', 'murder', 'Poe', 'quickly', 'first', 'criminal', 'profiler', 'consultant', 'Poe', 'Fields', 'what', 'kind', 'mind', 'killer', 'may', 'have', 'course', 'details', 'stories', 'killer', 'Poe', 'girlfriend', 'Emily', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'killer', 'promising', 'clues', 'Emily', 'whereabouts', 'new', 'murder', 'filmmakers', 'director', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'writers', 'Ben', 'Livingstone', 'Hannah', 'Shakespeare', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'recast', 'Poe', 'character', 'superhero', 'give', 'movie', 'Poe', 'real', 'Poe', 'did', ""n't"", 'could', ""n't"", 'possess', 'mentioned', 'filmmakers', 'stick', 'fairly', 'accurately', 'known', 'elements', 'Poe', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'are', 'artistic', 'liberties', 'taken', 'still', 'present', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'few', 'twists', 'as', 'who', 'murderer', 'is.Cusack', 'spot', 'Poe', 'look', 'thin', 'black', 'mustache', 'goatee', 'more', 'importantly', 'Poe', 'character', 'Poe', 'was', 'writer', 'who', 'had', 'ultimate', 'confidence', 'own', 'abilities', 'writer', 'was', 'dismissive', 'contemporaries', 'especially', 'were', 'more', 'successful', 'Cusack', 'supported', 'cast', 'note', 'right.If', 'think', 'movie', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'action', 'movie', ""'re"", 'more', 'literary', 'minded', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'inaccuracies', 'violate', 'Poe', 'character', 'will', 'throw', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

I would probably have seen this movie even if it was a B-Grade terrible film. Luckily, it is not.

He has mastered every ounce of his personality, and physical attributes. He not only acts like him, his very countenance is the same. The writers entwined both the historical details of Poe's last few days into a thriller/mystery involving a serial killer named Reynolds.

A few of the more devoted Poe fans may realize that the second murder victim from the Pit and the Pendulum was none other than Griswold (Poe's adversary in real life).

Tresca ""Talien""","[8, 11]","One day in college I stayed up far too late playing a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) and forgotten that I had an English quiz the next day.  Completely unprepared, I walked into the room ready to accept my fate, only to discover the topic was Edgar Allen Poe.  I had been reading Poe's ""Annabel Lee"" the night before for fun (this is what English majors do).  Could I pull it off? I imagine James McTeigue felt the same way when directing ""The Raven,"" but instead of one professor, thousands of English majors would be grading his paper.""The Raven"" begins with a murder of a woman and her child. Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) is the mild-mannered, well-read detective who makes the connection.  It's not long before he realizes the murderer was inspired by Poe's story, ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue."" Meanwhile, Poe (John Cusack, sporting a trademark high forehead and goatee) is a penniless alcoholic in love with the lovely Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve).  Her father (Brendan Gleeson) violently disagrees with the nature of their relationship.  It's not long before Poe's romantic issues collide with the murder plot and the erstwhile author is fighting for the love of his life.On its surface, ""The Raven"" is an American version of a Sherlock Holmes mystery: drug-addled genius navigates the 19th century criminal underworld allied with an underequipped police force. Unfortunately, Cusack's Poe doesn't measure up to Downey's performance. Poe is a crotchety sort, less lovable than Holmes, and the material never manages to elevate Poe above the Cliff Notes we know about him: he pines for a woman, drinks a lot, and verbally eviscerates everyone within ear's reach.The murders are fun if you remember the short stories, which I'm ashamed to admit I haven't read since college.  But McTeigue runs a fine line between crafting an entertaining tale and adhering closely to the material.  Emily Hamilton appears to be a stand-in for Sarah Helen Whitman. The inspiration for ""Annabel Lee"" is widely believed to be Poe's first wife, Virginia Clemm...his 13-year-old cousin, a fact conveniently left out of the film.The special effects occasionally fall flat, like the ""Pit and the Pendulum"" scene.  Given that Fields is such a logical investigator, it's curious he never looks into the massive amount of work necessary to construct a clockwork pendulum. Ra's al Ghul figured out who Batman was once by the massive amount of computer processors he purchased for his Batcave!""The Raven"" wants to have it all: a period piece with its lack of contractions in the dialogue, an eloquent series of rants on the state of literature by Poe, and anachronisms like ""serial killer"" and modern investigative techniques.  It waffles between all three modes without quite reconciling the discrepancy.The biggest problem is how ""The Raven"" was edited.  Emily is kidnapped by simply disappearing off screen.  It's almost as if the director changed his mind as to how she was going to exit and then didn't have the budget to go back and film it.  This is a recurring problem; chase scenes begin without it being clear who is chasing who.Fans of Poe know there are no happy endings for him.  Unfortunately, given the lack of firm direction, sloppy editing, and wooden acting, they don't end well for the audience either. But then, if you love Poe's work there's still some charm to be found here for those who remember their literature...which is how I get an A- on that pop quiz.",3,A pop quiz the director didn't study for,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,3450,"['One', 'day', 'college', 'stayed', 'up', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'playing', 'Multi-User', 'Dungeon', 'MUD', 'forgotten', 'had', 'English', 'quiz', 'next', 'day', 'Completely', 'unprepared', 'walked', 'room', 'ready', 'accept', 'fate', 'only', 'discover', 'topic', 'was', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'had', 'been', 'reading', 'Poe', 'Annabel', 'Lee', 'night', 'fun', 'what', 'English', 'majors', 'do', 'Could', 'pull', 'off', 'imagine', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'when', 'directing', 'Raven', 'instead', 'one', 'professor', 'thousands', 'English', 'majors', 'would', 'be', 'grading', 'paper', 'Raven', 'murder', 'woman', 'child', 'Emmett', 'Fields', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'mild-mannered', 'well-read', 'detective', 'who', 'connection', 'not', 'long', 'murderer', 'was', 'inspired', 'Poe', 'story', 'Murders', 'Rue', 'Morgue', 'Meanwhile', 'Poe', 'John', 'Cusack', 'sporting', 'trademark', 'high', 'forehead', 'goatee', 'penniless', 'alcoholic', 'love', 'lovely', 'Emily', 'Hamilton', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'father', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'violently', 'nature', 'relationship', 'not', 'long', 'Poe', 'romantic', 'issues', 'collide', 'murder', 'plot', 'erstwhile', 'author', 'fighting', 'love', 'life.On', 'surface', 'Raven', 'American', 'version', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'mystery', 'drug-addled', 'genius', '19th', 'century', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'allied', 'underequipped', 'police', 'force', 'Unfortunately', 'Cusack', 'Poe', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'Downey', 'performance', 'Poe', 'crotchety', 'sort', 'less', 'lovable', 'Holmes', 'material', 'never', 'elevate', 'Poe', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'know', 'woman', 'lot', 'verbally', 'everyone', 'ear', 'reach.The', 'murders', 'are', 'fun', 'remember', 'short', 'stories', ""'m"", 'ashamed', 'admit', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'college', 'McTeigue', 'fine', 'line', 'crafting', 'entertaining', 'tale', 'adhering', 'closely', 'material', 'Emily', 'Hamilton', 'be', 'stand-in', 'Sarah', 'Helen', 'Whitman', 'inspiration', 'Annabel', 'Lee', 'widely', 'believed', 'be', 'Poe', 'first', 'wife', 'Virginia', 'Clemm', '13-year-old', 'cousin', 'fact', 'conveniently', 'left', 'film.The', 'special', 'effects', 'occasionally', 'fall', 'flat', 'Pit', 'Pendulum', 'scene', 'Given', 'Fields', 'such', 'logical', 'investigator', 'curious', 'never', 'massive', 'amount', 'work', 'necessary', 'construct', 'clockwork', 'pendulum', 'Ra', 'al', 'Ghul', 'figured', 'out', 'who', 'Batman', 'was', 'once', 'massive', 'amount', 'computer', 'processors', 'purchased', 'Batcave', 'Raven', 'have', 'period', 'piece', 'lack', 'contractions', 'dialogue', 'eloquent', 'series', 'rants', 'state', 'literature', 'Poe', 'anachronisms', 'serial', 'killer', 'modern', 'investigative', 'techniques', 'three', 'modes', 'quite', 'reconciling', 'discrepancy.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'how', 'Raven', 'was', 'edited', 'Emily', 'kidnapped', 'simply', 'disappearing', 'off', 'screen', 'almost', 'director', 'changed', 'mind', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'exit', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'budget', 'go', 'back', 'film', 'recurring', 'problem', 'chase', 'scenes', 'begin', 'being', 'clear', 'who', 'chasing', 'who.Fans', 'Poe', 'know', 'are', 'happy', 'endings', 'Unfortunately', 'given', 'lack', 'firm', 'direction', 'sloppy', 'editing', 'wooden', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'well', 'audience', 'either', 'then', 'love', 'Poe', 'work', 'still', 'charm', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'who', 'remember', 'literature', 'how', 'get', 'A-', 'pop', 'quiz']",N/A

His stories were short, colorful and gave me nightmares.  In reality he wasn't appreciated much during his lifetime, became an alcoholic and drug user and squandered his earnings on his addictive vices.His death is a bit of a mystery as the film tells us up front.  He was found, near death on a park bench.  So director James McTeigue and writers Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare take us on a hypothetical journey of his last weeks.  In a role Nicolas Cage must have drooled over, Poe is played by John Cusack who is obviously having fun constantly playing drunk or stoned or both.  He's also obnoxiously in everyone's face most of the time, yet still manages to attract lovely Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve), the daughter of a wealthy retired military officer (Brendan Gleeson).When a couple grotesque murders take place, Poe is called in for questioning.  It appears the murders are copies of those appearing in Poe's stories.  The first, involving a woman and her young daughter, mimic ""Tales of the Rue Morgue.""  Poe is quickly excluded as a suspect by ace Baltimore Detective Fields (Luke Evans) and is brought in to help solve the case and those that follow.  Now the movie takes on a Holmes-Watson look.When Emily is kidnapped in front of everybody at a masquerade party, Poe is required to write stories for the newspaper or she will die, buried alive in a pine box.  All of this silliness really stretches credibility but I have to admit I had a hard time figuring out who the culprit was.

His dark hair and pale features match imagination we can have of poet who was as talented as he was emotionally troubled.  Poe's personality and character is pretty much formed by the difficult life he had.  Early on in his life, he lost people very close to him which gave him outlook on life and kind of sensitivity very few people can ever have in their lifetime.  Of course, this was by no way ""a gift"".  It made him social outcast that further led to his need to drink in order to dull the emotional pain and loneliness.I really enjoyed this film if for no other reason that for wonderful quotes from his poems.

1499574,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B005S9EJ8W,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","The Raven(released Mar/12)stars John Cusack as Edgar Allan Poe,Luke Evans as Inspector Emmett Fields,Alice Eve as Emily Hamilton,Brendan Gleeson as Captain Hamilton,Oliver Jackson-Cohen as PC Cantrell,Kevin McNally as Maddux,Sam Hazeldine as Reynolds,and others.This story,like Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter,takes a real premise,background,and/or character and gives a well thought out,but false story,as to the reasoning behind these aspects.With L:VH it was the fact that the real ex president had a heretofore hidden life hunting vampires.A very good film too(see my review on that).In the Raven the central premise is the fact of Edgar Allan Poe's suspicious death in 1849 in Baltimore.The writers have come up with an explanation leading up to that fateful day.And I must say it is a fascinating story to be sure.The story finds us in the mid-19th century in Baltimore as we are introduced to a punctilious and condescending Edgar A.Poe.He is in love with a rich Captains daughter,but is at the same time very broke.He is trying his darnedest to get the Baltimore paper he publishes for to print his reviews and,more importantly,obtain a drink from his local;and having no luck with either.Amidst this the police seem to have their collective hands full.Someone is committing some gruesome murders and the two the police have investigated,one right after the other,are both based on two of Poe's stories.The police come knocking on Poe's door,tell him what is going on and enlist his help to find the killer.A clue left after the last murder indicates the killer will strike at a ball the Captain is giving in his home.The police fully infiltrate the proceedings in order to apprehend the culprit.Suddenly a man on a horse wearing a mask enters the ball room and the police shoot him.He was just a distraction as the killer aways with the Captain's daughter and Poe's fiance'.Now they not only have to find the killer,but save the life of the captain's daughter before it is too late.Through her eyes we find she is in a coffin put under the dirt floor of a room.Each subsequent murder has a clue and the next leads them to a stage play of Macbeth where Poe actually catches a glimpse of the killer,but he escapes.Later Poe is chagrined to learn the killer has burned his house to the ground and Poe temporarily moves in with the police inspector on the case.The next clue leads them to the city underground sewer system.There they find the body of a missing stage hand from the theater,dressed to resemble the Captains missing daughter.Again the killer just manages to elude the authorities.With a clue found on their recent discovery they head to a church where one policemen is killed and the inspector is wounded.Poe rides off in pursuit but cannot get the killer.All along Poe has been publishing a new story to coincide with each murder discovery in the police's investigation.That morning a note and a newspaper arrive a Poe's home.The paper is wet whereas the note is dry.Poe deduces the note was written before the paper was delivered and therefore by someone who had access to the story before it was published.Poe rushes down to his paper editor's office to confront him.Meanwhile the ailing police inspector has found a clue and is hurriedly trying to get dressed and rush to find Poe.Poe enters the publishers office only to find him dead at his desk.The only other man there is the typesetter.The two have an interesting discussion.The typesetter gives Poe a slow acting poison to take in exchange for the whereabouts of his beloved.The typesetter gives Poe a verbal clue as he leaves but not a direct answer.Poe suddenly figures it out and is able to find a trapped door underneath the desk they sat at and he eventually finds and saves his future wife.The authorities and an ambulance arrive to take the Captains daughter away but Poe is nowhere to be found.On a park bench Poe is siting in a daze and awaiting his inevitable fate.A stranger comes up to him inquiring about his health and offering assistance.Poe is able to tell the man the typesetters name.Poe dies and and the stranger passes what he heard Poe say onto the inspector.Fast forward and the typesetter has arrived where he told Poe he would be going;in Paris.Getting into a carriage he meets the inspector.A gun fires...fade to black.We have all seen films in the past that concern serial killers,even ones such as this who follow fictitious stories with which to commit murders.But because this one has just enough of an interesting twist and is based on a true historical figure,it gives it a nice edge and one up.John Cusack I thought did an excellent job as the melancholy and conflicted Edgar A.The writers here include an explanation as to Poe's melancholia, and they also have a police department/inspector who is not portrayed as a complete moron.This one actually has good police skills and neither Poe or the inspector could have gotten as far as they did without the other.The entire cast does a wonderful job and the sets/costumes are relatively good recreations of a mid 19th century Baltimore.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.the only extra is a commentary track.To be truthful I must say I am not usually into murder mysteries as such,but once in a while a good enough one comes along to surprise me,and this is one.Well acted,kudos to Cusack,and a nice driving plot,this film comes well

1499575,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005S9EJ8W,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","The Raven (James McTeigue, 2012)I had a review of The Raven written a couple of weeks after I watched it. Most of one, anyway; by the time a couple of weeks had passed, I'd forgotten enough that I knew I needed to go back and re-watch a few scenes in order to make sure I had certain facts straight. But the fact that after such a short time I had forgotten so much about the movie was telling, and informed that review. Then my computer ate it. And so here I am starting it again, months later, after I have rewatched those scenes in order to fill in the blanks. Now I have the opposite problem; I've forgotten most of that initial review. But I can guarantee you that the new one will be equally informed by how much I had forgotten about The Raven so quickly after watching it.Plot: a serial killer in pre-Civil War-era Baltimore is patterning his crime scenes after the stories of Edgar Allan Poe. The police, of course, seek Poe (Say Anything...'s John Cusack) out and initially consider him as suspect, but a rising star in the department, Detective Fields (Clash of the Titans' Luke Evans), takes a different approach and enlists the mystery writer as a consultant. Which is all well and good until the serial killer sets his sights on Poe and his lady love Emily Hamilton (Star Trek: Into Darkness' Alice Eve).It's all quite pretty, in the same way as McTeigue's earlier hit V for Vendetta, but also like that movie, the longer we go since I see the movie, the less I remember about it other than how well-shot it is. The mystery angle is entirely generic, save for its historical angle, and there are no twists you won't see coming a mile away. The cast assembled for this movie is quite good&#8212;the woefully underutilized Brendan Gleeson plays the precinct captain, for example, and he was the reason I finally decided to sit down and watch the movie&#8212;but none of them, including Cusack and Eve, do anything to make me remember why exactly this cast is so good. If nothing else, losing the review and needing to rewrite it has confirmed my original rating of the film, perhaps even reaffirmed it. It's a supermodel&#8212;pretty, but utterly forgettable once you spend some time with it. * ",2,"Never, ever, evermore.",1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,2207,"['Raven', 'James', 'McTeigue', '2012', 'had', 'review', 'Raven', 'written', 'couple', 'weeks', 'watched', 'Most', 'one', 'anyway', 'time', 'couple', 'weeks', 'had', 'passed', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'enough', 'knew', 'needed', 'go', 'back', 're-watch', 'few', 'scenes', 'order', 'make', 'sure', 'had', 'certain', 'facts', 'straight', 'fact', 'short', 'time', 'had', 'forgotten', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'telling', 'informed', 'review', 'Then', 'computer', 'ate', 'so', 'here', 'am', 'starting', 'again', 'months', 'later', 'have', 'rewatched', 'scenes', 'order', 'fill', 'blanks', 'Now', 'have', 'opposite', 'problem', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'most', 'initial', 'review', 'can', 'guarantee', 'new', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'equally', 'informed', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'forgotten', 'Raven', 'quickly', 'watching', 'it.Plot', 'serial', 'killer', 'pre-Civil', 'War-era', 'Baltimore', 'patterning', 'crime', 'scenes', 'stories', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'police', 'course', 'seek', 'Poe', 'Say', 'Anything', 'John', 'Cusack', 'initially', 'consider', 'suspect', 'rising', 'star', 'department', 'Detective', 'Fields', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'different', 'approach', 'mystery', 'writer', 'consultant', 'Which', 'well', 'good', 'serial', 'killer', 'sights', 'Poe', 'lady', 'love', 'Emily', 'Hamilton', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'Alice', 'Eve', '.It', 'quite', 'pretty', 'same', 'way', 'McTeigue', 'earlier', 'hit', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'also', 'movie', 'longer', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'less', 'remember', 'other', 'how', 'well-shot', 'mystery', 'angle', 'entirely', 'generic', 'save', 'historical', 'angle', 'are', 'twists', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'cast', 'assembled', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', '8212', 'woefully', 'underutilized', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'precinct', 'captain', 'example', 'was', 'reason', 'finally', 'decided', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', '8212', 'none', 'including', 'Cusack', 'Eve', 'do', 'anything', 'make', 'remember', 'why', 'exactly', 'cast', 'so', 'good', 'nothing', 'else', 'losing', 'review', 'needing', 'rewrite', 'confirmed', 'original', 'rating', 'film', 'perhaps', 'even', 'reaffirmed', 'supermodel', '8212', 'pretty', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'once', 'spend', 'time', '*']",N/A

1499580,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B005S9EJ8W,Samuel McKewon,"[11, 16]","Morbid but not fascinating, ""The Raven"" is one of the darkest films the year. Literally. Most of this fictionalized, ridiculous account of writer Edgar Allen Poe's final hours takes place at night in 1849 - 25 years before the popularization of the light bulb. Director James McTeigue is determined to stay honest. So mist, murk and half-seen figures rule. The insides of your eyelids - drawing like shades out of boredom - tend to create darkness, too.Poe (played here by John Cusack) died at 40 in a Baltimore hospital four days after after a local man discovered him delirious on a park bench. ""The Raven"" - named after his most famous poem, which has little to do with this film - supplies a reason for Poe's state. Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare's screenplay is crude and cynical: A copycat serial killer, staging his crimes in homage to Poe's accumulated horror stories, is on the loose, challenging the poet to...write something? Catch him?And that's the meat of it. ""The Raven"" makes a halfhearted stab at depicting Poe's actual life - booze tabs, financial struggles, romantic woes - before plunging into the plot. The police captain (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) wears a pained look, Poe's pretty girlfriend with the two front teeth (Alice Eve) pauses and whispers a lot, while her wealthy dad (Brendan Gleeson) puffs and gloats. A number of Poe's stories - notably ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" and ""The Cask of Amontillado"" - are used as ""inspiration"" for the murders. Based on his muddled motive, the killer is a nut, but he goes through a lot of planning and trouble despite what appears to be on-the-fly decisions.Cusack's best performances are studies in subtlety and counterpunch humor; he doesn't start a ribbing match, but he finishes it. In ""The Raven,"" Poe is loud, tortured and fond of yelling ""Philistine!"" A bigger, more bankable name than any of the cast and crew combined, why didn't Cusack tailor the script to his strengths? Why even accept the job? After all: Do you want to see a movie about Hemingway in which a handyman stages a murder to look like suicide?McTeigue (""V for Vendetta"") and his screenwriters don't give much room for the work itself aside from a handful of readings to women, who, along with serial killers, appear to be Poe's primary fans. If Poe's genius involved a devotion to his writing method, the film based on his death, of all things, is hardly concerned.",2,Quoth The Raven: Never see this movie,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,2408,"['Morbid', 'not', 'fascinating', 'Raven', 'one', 'darkest', 'films', 'year', 'Literally', 'Most', 'fictionalized', 'ridiculous', 'account', 'writer', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'final', 'hours', 'place', 'night', '1849', '25', 'years', 'popularization', 'light', 'bulb', 'Director', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'determined', 'stay', 'honest', 'So', 'mist', 'murk', 'half-seen', 'figures', 'rule', 'insides', 'eyelids', 'drawing', 'shades', 'boredom', 'tend', 'create', 'darkness', 'too.Poe', 'played', 'here', 'John', 'Cusack', 'died', '40', 'Baltimore', 'hospital', 'four', 'days', 'local', 'man', 'discovered', 'delirious', 'park', 'bench', 'Raven', 'named', 'most', 'famous', 'poem', 'little', 'do', 'film', 'reason', 'Poe', 'state', 'Ben', 'Livingston', 'Hannah', 'Shakespeare', 'screenplay', 'crude', 'cynical', 'copycat', 'serial', 'killer', 'staging', 'crimes', 'homage', 'Poe', 'accumulated', 'horror', 'stories', 'loose', 'challenging', 'poet', 'write', 'something', 'Catch', 'meat', 'Raven', 'halfhearted', 'stab', 'depicting', 'Poe', 'actual', 'life', 'booze', 'tabs', 'financial', 'struggles', 'romantic', 'woes', 'plunging', 'plot', 'police', 'captain', 'Oliver', 'Jackson-Cohen', 'pained', 'look', 'Poe', 'pretty', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'front', 'teeth', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'lot', 'wealthy', 'dad', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'puffs', 'gloats', 'number', 'Poe', 'stories', 'notably', 'Pit', 'Pendulum', 'Cask', 'Amontillado', 'are', 'used', 'inspiration', 'murders', 'Based', 'muddled', 'motive', 'killer', 'nut', 'lot', 'planning', 'trouble', 'what', 'be', 'on-the-fly', 'decisions.Cusack', 'best', 'performances', 'are', 'studies', 'subtlety', 'counterpunch', 'humor', ""n't"", 'start', 'ribbing', 'match', 'Raven', 'Poe', 'loud', 'tortured', 'fond', 'yelling', 'Philistine', 'A', 'bigger', 'more', 'bankable', 'name', 'cast', 'crew', 'combined', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Cusack', 'tailor', 'script', 'strengths', 'Why', 'even', 'accept', 'job', 'Do', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'Hemingway', 'handyman', 'murder', 'look', 'suicide', 'McTeigue', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'screenwriters', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'room', 'work', 'aside', 'handful', 'readings', 'women', 'who', 'serial', 'killers', 'appear', 'be', 'Poe', 'primary', 'fans', 'Poe', 'genius', 'involved', 'devotion', 'writing', 'method', 'film', 'based', 'death', 'things', 'hardly', 'concerned']",N/A

These include such theatrical and literary affairs as;The Fall of the House of Usher,The Pit and the Pendulum,The Masque of the Red Death, The Premature Burial, and of courseThe Raven, all of which can be found in literary form inThe Works of Edgar Allan Poe - Volume 1.Thsi movie stars John Cusack fromGrosse Pointe Blankfame as Edgar Allen Poe and Alice Eve fromShe's Out of My Leaguefame as his love interest Elizabeth. This story is set in Baltimore, Maryland in 1849 just days before the actual death of Edgar Allen Poe and I really liked how the wove this story and his actual death into the plot, which is as follows without giving away any spoilers.A serial murderer is on the loose in Baltimore, Maryland and he is killing his victims according to various methods described in several of Poe's poems and stories, which leads the local police inspector to believe that Poe could actually be of some help in helping to solve these brutal murders and help apprehend the murderer. Naturally of course the murderer attacks Poe indirectly by kidnapping and threatening to kill his fiance Elizabeth unless Poe can decipher the clues left with each victim to find Elizabeth in time. The movie moved fairly well from scene to scene and although not overly surprising the plot was good enough to keep my interest, although I must say I was a bit dismayed by the ending where Poe allowed himself to be subdued in a sense by the villain in a similar way as Keifer Sutherland was by Jeff Bridges in the movie,The Vanishing. Why can't the hero show a bit more viciousness when confronted by the villain and take care of business, rather than fall prey to emotion. Hmmmm, maybe next time!One really great moment for me in this film was when you find out who the murderer really is. I didn't have a clue until it was revealed in the film. That was a nice touch and a welcome relief instead of usually finding out within the first few minutes of the film.Is this movie worth seeing? Definitely! But you may enjoy it more if you are a fan of Poe, or at the very least read some of his works. My girlfriend has never read any of Poe's stories nor seen any of the aforementioned films, therefore she didn't she didn't enjoy the film as much as I did, but she did enjoy it. So although you don't have to necessarily be familiar with Poe to enjoy this movie, you will I am sure enjoy it more if you are.Shawn KovacichMovie AficionadoAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.",4,Interesting Theatrical Take On the American Literary Classics by Poe,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,2849,"['Well', 'just', 'got', 'home', 'viewing', 'midnight', 'premiere', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'based', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'life', 'American', 'literary', 'great', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'who', 'wrote', 'such', 'mesmerizing', 'diabolically', 'twisted', 'tales', 'were', 'first', 'written', 'early', '1800', 'later', 'made', 'movies', '1960', 'many', 'starred', 'late', 'great', 'horror', 'actor', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'include', 'such', 'theatrical', 'literary', 'affairs', 'Fall', 'House', 'Usher', 'Pit', 'Pendulum', 'Masque', 'Red', 'Death', 'Premature', 'Burial', 'courseThe', 'Raven', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'literary', 'form', 'inThe', 'Works', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'Volume', '1.Thsi', 'movie', 'stars', 'John', 'Cusack', 'fromGrosse', 'Pointe', 'Blankfame', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'fromShe', 'Out', 'My', 'Leaguefame', 'love', 'interest', 'Elizabeth', 'story', 'set', 'Baltimore', 'Maryland', '1849', 'just', 'days', 'actual', 'death', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'wove', 'story', 'actual', 'death', 'plot', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers.A', 'serial', 'murderer', 'loose', 'Baltimore', 'Maryland', 'killing', 'victims', 'according', 'various', 'methods', 'described', 'several', 'Poe', 'poems', 'stories', 'local', 'police', 'inspector', 'believe', 'Poe', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'help', 'helping', 'solve', 'brutal', 'murders', 'help', 'apprehend', 'murderer', 'Naturally', 'course', 'murderer', 'attacks', 'Poe', 'indirectly', 'kidnapping', 'threatening', 'kill', 'fiance', 'Elizabeth', 'Poe', 'can', 'decipher', 'clues', 'left', 'victim', 'find', 'Elizabeth', 'time', 'movie', 'moved', 'fairly', 'well', 'scene', 'scene', 'not', 'overly', 'surprising', 'plot', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'keep', 'interest', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'bit', 'dismayed', 'ending', 'where', 'Poe', 'allowed', 'be', 'subdued', 'sense', 'villain', 'similar', 'way', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'movie', 'Vanishing', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hero', 'show', 'bit', 'more', 'viciousness', 'when', 'confronted', 'villain', 'take', 'care', 'business', 'rather', 'fall', 'prey', 'emotion', 'Hmmmm', 'maybe', 'next', 'time', 'One', 'really', 'great', 'moment', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'murderer', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'was', 'revealed', 'film', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'welcome', 'relief', 'instead', 'usually', 'finding', 'out', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film.Is', 'movie', 'seeing', 'Definitely', 'may', 'enjoy', 'more', 'are', 'fan', 'Poe', 'very', 'least', 'read', 'works', 'girlfriend', 'never', 'read', 'Poe', 'stories', 'seen', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'did', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'necessarily', 'be', 'familiar', 'Poe', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'will', 'am', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'more', 'are.Shawn', 'KovacichMovie', 'AficionadoAuthor', 'Creator', 'numerous', 'books', 'DVD']",N/A

1499601,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B005S9EJ8W,The Jaundiced Eye,"[0, 0]","This movie really disappointed me. The premise was wonderful....Edgar Allen Poe joins forces with a young Sherlock Holmes-like detective (well played by Luke Evans)to solve a series of grisly murders in turn-of-the-century Baltimore. Throw in a great cast featuring one of my all-time favorite actors, John Cusack, and you have the perfect recipe for a crime/horror masterpiece. The reality, however, fell way short of ""masterpiece"" and landed solidly in the ""mediocre"" category. I don't regret watching it, but I do not give it my enthusiastic recommendation.Problems: John Cusack seemed strangely detached and delivered a completely flat, unengaging performance. I never connected with his character and thus never became personally involved in the story. They could have hired a B-Movie hack actor, paid him one-tenth the salary, and probably ended up with a better production. The presence of a great actor not living up to expectations always degrades one's appreciation of a movie, and, quite frankly, his presence was more a distraction than an asset.The supposed relationship between Poe and Emily (Alice Eve) never seemed the least bit compelling or even believable. He is a drunken, completely self-absorbed, broken down (and just plain broke) hack writer. She is young, rich, and beautiful. I guess such a relationship could possibly exist, but no details are provided to ever make us understand why it does. Their shared dialog and interactions are strictly melodramatic and never give evidence of any sincere love or affection.The motives of the villain are not clear or credible. Like all poorly-drawn movie villains, he knows everything, appears and disappears as if by magic, and seems to benefit from an absurd confluence of perfect timing and luck. The clues he leaves are ridiculously complex and indecipherable, particularly a location that would require extremely precise measurements to calculate and yet is done so, to absolute perfection, using very vague information.Bottom line: This movie showed huge promise. Having seen the early previews, I could not wait to see it. When expectations are great, the possibility of disappointment increases, and in this case, the let-down was extreme. I still gave it three stars, because the premise really is wonderful, Luke Evans does a good job, and it does offer some good moments, but, to me, it was nowhere near being as good as it should have been.",3,I Expected More....Especially from John Cusack,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,2419,"['movie', 'really', 'disappointed', 'premise', 'was', 'wonderful', '.Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'forces', 'young', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes-like', 'detective', 'well', 'played', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'solve', 'series', 'grisly', 'murders', 'turn-of-the-century', 'Baltimore', 'Throw', 'great', 'cast', 'featuring', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'John', 'Cusack', 'have', 'perfect', 'recipe', 'crime/horror', 'masterpiece', 'reality', 'however', 'fell', 'way', 'short', 'masterpiece', 'landed', 'solidly', 'mediocre', 'category', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'watching', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'enthusiastic', 'recommendation.Problems', 'John', 'Cusack', 'seemed', 'strangely', 'detached', 'delivered', 'completely', 'flat', 'unengaging', 'performance', 'never', 'connected', 'character', 'thus', 'never', 'became', 'personally', 'involved', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'hired', 'B-Movie', 'hack', 'actor', 'paid', 'one-tenth', 'salary', 'probably', 'ended', 'up', 'better', 'production', 'presence', 'great', 'actor', 'not', 'living', 'up', 'expectations', 'always', 'degrades', 'one', 'appreciation', 'movie', 'quite', 'frankly', 'presence', 'was', 'more', 'distraction', 'asset.The', 'supposed', 'relationship', 'Poe', 'Emily', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'never', 'seemed', 'least', 'bit', 'compelling', 'even', 'believable', 'drunken', 'completely', 'self-absorbed', 'broken', 'down', 'just', 'plain', 'broke', 'hack', 'writer', 'young', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'guess', 'relationship', 'could', 'possibly', 'exist', 'details', 'are', 'provided', 'ever', 'make', 'understand', 'why', 'Their', 'shared', 'dialog', 'interactions', 'are', 'strictly', 'melodramatic', 'never', 'give', 'evidence', 'sincere', 'love', 'affection.The', 'motives', 'villain', 'are', 'not', 'clear', 'credible', 'poorly-drawn', 'movie', 'villains', 'everything', 'magic', 'benefit', 'absurd', 'confluence', 'perfect', 'timing', 'luck', 'clues', 'are', 'ridiculously', 'complex', 'indecipherable', 'particularly', 'location', 'would', 'require', 'extremely', 'precise', 'measurements', 'calculate', 'yet', 'done', 'so', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'using', 'very', 'vague', 'information.Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'showed', 'huge', 'promise', 'Having', 'seen', 'early', 'previews', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'When', 'expectations', 'are', 'great', 'possibility', 'disappointment', 'increases', 'case', 'let-down', 'was', 'extreme', 'still', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'premise', 'really', 'wonderful', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'good', 'job', 'offer', 'good', 'moments', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'been']",N/A

Some more histories based on one iota of fact. Then we get a retelling of Robin Hood and stories of the Middle Ages, Shakespeare, and the next thing you know Abe Lincoln is killing vampires and zombies. Now Poe. It seems as the liberties with history has become progressively worse.This is a fictional story using the real character of Poe, his works, that fact he lived in Baltimore and not much more. The writers of the script wanting to ward off such criticisms have Poe ask, ""Is imagination a felony?"" Poe teams up with Detective Fields (Luke Evans) and Captain Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson) to find Emily (Alice Eve) who is being held by a man who is killing people in the manner of Poe's tales.There were a number of things that I didn't like in this blockbuster, first being Cusack's portrayal of Poe himself. It wasn't convincing for me. The opening scene of a full moon, a raven, and a woman screaming was a little too cliche. I felt insulted that the writer thought he could get away with such a shallow script.

One of the greatest, perhaps the greatest, author to do so was Edgar Allen Poe. Most have been lucky enough to have never experienced the horror they put on the page brought to life. In this latest John Cusack film, Poe is not so lucky.We first see Poe (played by Cusack) in the last days of his life. The event depicted has been the subject of debate among historians but, for dramatic purposes, it's accepted as fact and I take no issue with that. Days earlier, a woman and child are found and have been murdered in a grisly manner. The murderer managed to flee the scene despite the doors being locked when the police arrived and windows that appeared to be nailed shut. An investigator, Detective Emmett Fields (played by Luke Evans) discovers how the killer concealed his escape and recognizes that the inspiration for the trickery was a work of fiction produced by Poe. He is the prime suspect until another murder is committed while he is being questioned. It appears to be inspired by yet another work of Poe's and so Fields (Evans) hopes that involving the man who used to be his prime suspect might allow him to gain some advantage over the murderer who's now claimed the lives of three innocent people. All the while Poe is madly in love with the daughter of a respected military officer who cannot stand him. But when Emily (Poe's love interest, played by Alice Eve) is in jeopardy, the Captain (Emily's father, played by Brendan Gleeson) and Poe put their differences aside and work together to save the one person they both love more than anything.Now, I believed this was Cusack's first film since 2009's 2012. In fact, I'd forgotten about Hot Tub Time Machine which followed that as did two other films I never even knew about. Also noteworthy is the fact that, of numerous works based on or otherwise connected to Poe and his publications, this is the third to be given the title The Raven. But even with all that against it, this film is entertaining. No member of the cast should hold their breath waiting for an Oscar nomination. Neither should anyone who was involved behind the scenes, but it's an involving tale in an interesting setting with a well-acted cast and I liked it.",4,Poe on Patrol,1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,2323,"['are', 'many', 'who', 'seek', 'entertain', 'illustrating', 'darker', 'elements', 'human', 'existence', 'Murder', 'intrigue', 'macabre', 'One', 'greatest', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'author', 'do', 'so', 'was', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'Most', 'have', 'been', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'horror', 'put', 'page', 'brought', 'life', 'latest', 'John', 'Cusack', 'film', 'Poe', 'not', 'so', 'lucky.We', 'first', 'see', 'Poe', 'played', 'Cusack', 'last', 'days', 'life', 'event', 'depicted', 'been', 'subject', 'debate', 'historians', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'accepted', 'fact', 'take', 'issue', 'earlier', 'woman', 'child', 'are', 'found', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', 'grisly', 'manner', 'murderer', 'managed', 'flee', 'scene', 'doors', 'being', 'locked', 'when', 'police', 'arrived', 'windows', 'appeared', 'be', 'nailed', 'shut', 'investigator', 'Detective', 'Emmett', 'Fields', 'played', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'how', 'killer', 'concealed', 'escape', 'inspiration', 'trickery', 'was', 'work', 'fiction', 'produced', 'Poe', 'prime', 'suspect', 'murder', 'committed', 'being', 'questioned', 'be', 'inspired', 'yet', 'work', 'Poe', 'so', 'Fields', 'Evans', 'involving', 'man', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'prime', 'suspect', 'might', 'allow', 'gain', 'advantage', 'murderer', 'who', 'now', 'claimed', 'lives', 'three', 'innocent', 'people', 'while', 'Poe', 'madly', 'love', 'daughter', 'respected', 'military', 'officer', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'when', 'Emily', 'Poe', 'love', 'interest', 'played', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'jeopardy', 'Captain', 'Emily', 'father', 'played', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Poe', 'put', 'differences', 'aside', 'work', 'together', 'save', 'one', 'person', 'love', 'more', 'anything.Now', 'believed', 'was', 'Cusack', 'first', 'film', '2009', '2012', 'fact', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'Hot', 'Tub', 'Time', 'Machine', 'followed', 'did', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'fact', 'numerous', 'works', 'based', 'otherwise', 'connected', 'Poe', 'publications', 'third', 'be', 'given', 'title', 'Raven', 'even', 'film', 'entertaining', 'member', 'cast', 'should', 'hold', 'breath', 'waiting', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'should', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'scenes', 'involving', 'tale', 'interesting', 'setting', 'well-acted', 'cast', 'liked']",N/A

And what if it is Poe himself who has to track down the murderer? Set in Baltimore, 1849, ""The Raven"" starts out with this unique idea, but soon the film squanders its great potential by failing to provide a main story that can hold the viewer's attention to the end. In short, ""The Raven,"" directed by James McTeigue (""V for Vendetta""), has numerous references to the life and works of Poe, but neither Poe's character nor his story is interesting in ""The Raven.""Intense John Cusack plays Edgar Allan Poe, a perpetually drunk, penniless writer, who wants to have his review published. But the newspaper editor Maddux (Kevin McNally) doesn't want one; Maddux wants something lurid and sensational, something like ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" Poe once wrote.In the meanwhile, Inspector Fields (Luke Evans) investigates a brutal murder case, which, the intelligent police detective discovers, resembles one story Edgar Allan Poe wrote. The inspector and the writer then join forces to solve the case, but the killer keeps one step ahead of them.Atmospheric as it is, ""The Raven"" is not mysterious as it should be, with its plodding pace and by-the-numbers storytelling that dilute what little thrill there is to be had. Alice Eve is wasted as Poe's romantic interest Emily, and so is Brendan Gleeson as Emily's strict father. To make matters worse, some contraptions that are inspired by Poe's original works look familiar to us now.Of course, Poe is the original, an eccentric genius who created ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" and ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue.""

It is just that the film doesn't have a storyline that is as engrossing and gripping as Poe's macabre tales from which it draws inspiration.",2,Poe Without Mystery,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,1821,"['What', 'someone', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'stories', 'dark', 'tales', 'real', 'life', 'what', 'Poe', 'who', 'track', 'down', 'murderer', 'Set', 'Baltimore', '1849', 'Raven', 'out', 'unique', 'idea', 'soon', 'film', 'great', 'potential', 'failing', 'provide', 'main', 'story', 'can', 'hold', 'viewer', 'attention', 'end', 'short', 'Raven', 'directed', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'numerous', 'references', 'life', 'works', 'Poe', 'Poe', 'character', 'story', 'interesting', 'Raven', 'Intense', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'perpetually', 'drunk', 'penniless', 'writer', 'who', 'have', 'review', 'published', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'Maddux', 'Kevin', 'McNally', ""n't"", 'want', 'one', 'Maddux', 'something', 'lurid', 'sensational', 'something', 'Tell-Tale', 'Heart', 'Poe', 'once', 'wrote.In', 'meanwhile', 'Inspector', 'Fields', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'brutal', 'murder', 'case', 'intelligent', 'police', 'detective', 'discovers', 'one', 'story', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'wrote', 'inspector', 'writer', 'then', 'join', 'forces', 'solve', 'case', 'killer', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'them.Atmospheric', 'Raven', 'not', 'mysterious', 'should', 'be', 'plodding', 'pace', 'by-the-numbers', 'storytelling', 'dilute', 'what', 'little', 'thrill', 'be', 'had', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'wasted', 'Poe', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Emily', 'so', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Emily', 'strict', 'father', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'contraptions', 'are', 'inspired', 'Poe', 'original', 'works', 'look', 'familiar', 'now.Of', 'course', 'Poe', 'original', 'eccentric', 'genius', 'who', 'created', 'Pit', 'Pendulum', 'Murders', 'Rue', 'Morgue', 'not', 'Raven', 'terrible', 'just', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'storyline', 'engrossing', 'gripping', 'Poe', 'macabre', 'tales', 'inspiration']",N/A

He was found gravely ill in Baltimore, Maryland dressed in clothes not his own and spouting incomprehensible phrases. It's said that one of the things he kept repeating over and over was the name ""Reynolds.""  The screenwriters and filmmakers of THE RAVEN have used the strange death of Edgar Allan Poe as the event that ties the story together.THE RAVEN is set in Baltimore in 1849. Poe (John Cusack) has returned to Baltimore. He's broke and he can't get the local newspaper to publish his latest review. However, he's also a man in love. The woman of his affection, Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) is the daughter of a wealthy and prominent businessman who hates Poe with a passion. Unbeknownst to Poe, there was a series of murders committed the night before that resemble the murders in his story, ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue."" Police Detective Fields (Luke Evans) brings in Poe for questioning and after deciding that he is not the murderer brings Poe aboard the case as a consultant. The murderer is playing a game with both the police and Poe and the crimes he commits all resemble murders from Poe's stories. The stakes become higher as the game goes as Poe and Fields rush to solve the case and stop the killings.John Cusack does a great job as always. Cusack has starred in some decent movies as well as some not so great ones. However, even the ones that aren't so good are worth watching because of Cusack. He's just a great actor to watch. Luke Evans does a decent job as Detective Fields and Kevin McNally is fun as newspaper editor Maddox. Alice Eve isn't really given much to do; she's a damsel in distress and not much more.THE RAVEN does play around with some of the ""facts"" of Poe's last days on Earth (his last few days are, to this day, shrouded in mystery). It also has several anachronisms (such as the word ""serial killer"" that is used). Like many of Poe's stories, the movie is also extremely violent. Lastly, the film builds to a climax that is rather anti-climatical.With that said, I enjoyed THE RAVEN. It's action packed and is full of Poe references (both from his real life and from his bibliography). It has the potential to inspire younger people (who otherwise might completely avoid reading) to explore the author and read some of his works. It's grisly fun and actually kept me guessing who the killer was until just before the reveal.The movie has been criticized by some for playing loose and fast with the facts of Poe's life and turning him into a modern detective hero. These criticisms are unfounded. Poe is the father of the modern detective story. His short stories influenced both Wilkie Collins and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It's not inconceivable that Poe could have actually made a great detective.Also, the literary & historical mashups are all the rage right now. The characters in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE are zombie fighters, Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter, Queen Victoria is a demons hunter, and Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy join forces to fight off a zombie horde in a video game sequence. Some of these stories aren't written very good, but overall, I like the historical and literary mashups. THE RAVEN unfolds in the spirit of a mashup and though the ending leaves something to be desired, the way it portrays Poe doesn't dishonor the author, but pays homage to him instead.",4,Quoth the Raven,1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,3425,"['Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'very', 'happy', 'life', 'was', 'met', 'tragedy', 'life', 'was', 'found', 'gravely', 'ill', 'Baltimore', 'Maryland', 'dressed', 'clothes', 'not', 'own', 'spouting', 'incomprehensible', 'phrases', 'said', 'one', 'things', 'kept', 'repeating', 'was', 'name', 'Reynolds', 'screenwriters', 'filmmakers', 'THE', 'RAVEN', 'have', 'used', 'strange', 'death', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'event', 'story', 'together.THE', 'RAVEN', 'set', 'Baltimore', '1849', 'Poe', 'John', 'Cusack', 'returned', 'Baltimore', 'broke', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'local', 'newspaper', 'publish', 'latest', 'review', 'However', 'also', 'man', 'love', 'woman', 'affection', 'Emily', 'Hamilton', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'prominent', 'businessman', 'who', 'Poe', 'passion', 'Unbeknownst', 'Poe', 'was', 'series', 'murders', 'committed', 'night', 'resemble', 'murders', 'story', 'Murders', 'Rue', 'Morgue', 'Police', 'Detective', 'Fields', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'Poe', 'questioning', 'deciding', 'not', 'murderer', 'Poe', 'case', 'consultant', 'murderer', 'playing', 'game', 'police', 'Poe', 'crimes', 'resemble', 'murders', 'Poe', 'stories', 'stakes', 'become', 'higher', 'game', 'Poe', 'Fields', 'rush', 'solve', 'case', 'stop', 'killings.John', 'Cusack', 'great', 'job', 'always', 'Cusack', 'starred', 'decent', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'ones', 'However', 'even', 'ones', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'good', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'Cusack', 'just', 'great', 'actor', 'watch', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'decent', 'job', 'Detective', 'Fields', 'Kevin', 'McNally', 'fun', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'Maddox', 'Alice', 'Eve', ""n't"", 'really', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'damsel', 'distress', 'not', 'much', 'more.THE', 'RAVEN', 'play', 'around', 'facts', 'Poe', 'last', 'days', 'Earth', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'are', 'day', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'also', 'several', 'anachronisms', 'such', 'word', 'serial', 'killer', 'used', 'many', 'Poe', 'stories', 'movie', 'also', 'extremely', 'violent', 'Lastly', 'film', 'climax', 'rather', 'anti-climatical.With', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'THE', 'RAVEN', 'action', 'packed', 'full', 'Poe', 'references', 'real', 'life', 'bibliography', 'potential', 'inspire', 'younger', 'people', 'who', 'otherwise', 'might', 'completely', 'avoid', 'reading', 'explore', 'author', 'read', 'works', 'grisly', 'fun', 'actually', 'kept', 'guessing', 'who', 'killer', 'was', 'just', 'reveal.The', 'movie', 'been', 'criticized', 'playing', 'loose', 'fast', 'facts', 'Poe', 'life', 'turning', 'modern', 'detective', 'hero', 'criticisms', 'are', 'unfounded', 'Poe', 'father', 'modern', 'detective', 'story', 'short', 'stories', 'influenced', 'Wilkie', 'Collins', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'not', 'inconceivable', 'Poe', 'could', 'have', 'actually', 'made', 'great', 'detective.Also', 'literary', 'historical', 'mashups', 'are', 'rage', 'right', 'now', 'characters', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'are', 'zombie', 'fighters', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'demons', 'hunter', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'join', 'forces', 'fight', 'off', 'zombie', 'horde', 'video', 'game', 'sequence', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'written', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'like', 'historical', 'literary', 'mashups', 'THE', 'RAVEN', 'unfolds', 'spirit', 'mashup', 'ending', 'leaves', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'way', 'Poe', ""n't"", 'dishonor', 'author', 'homage', 'instead']",N/A

Loud, bawdy, arrogant, disturbed, conceited, witty, sharp; everything you just know Poe was in person. His 19th century barbs were deliciously creative and delightfully fun to watch. The disappointment was... pretty much the rest of the movie. The plot was mediocre, a mixture of ""Silence of the Lambs"" (without the amazing psychologically creepy factor) and ""Seven"" (with twice the graphic gore). I enjoyed the acting of ""Fields"" (the main detective), he was intense, devoted, and exuded a beautiful sense of fairness and justice. The rest was just... too predictable. Killer leaves a clue, police arrive just in time to find a gory murder with Poe-esque flavor from one of his stories. Killer leaves another clue, police arrive... well, you get the picture. That repeats several times. The whole thing seems plot-less and pointless. We don't care enough about Emily to care that she's missing and held hostage. The killer's motive is vague and empty and leaves you thinking ""huh?"" at the end of the movie. He's a Hannibal-ish wannabe with none of the creepiness, brilliance, or passion. I also found myself disappointed in the idea that Poe would start to doubt himself and his writings, presumably because they were the fodder for the killer/kidnapper's ideas. The real Poe was far too conceited and ingenius to suddenly sit down and think ""Gosh.. maybe I suck.. all of my stories might kill my girlfriend.. maybe I shouldn't have written anything, ever, at all"".

Some reviews here have confused the man with the character created for this film so let's be clear--this is a fictionalized account around Poe's last days and nicely captures the feel for the era.SPOILERS:Detective Emmert Fields (Luke Evans) puts pressure on Poe to help him find a killer that uses the author's stories as a template for his actions. Soon it becomes clear to Fields and Poe that the killer wants the author engaged in the pursuit as he kills one of Poe's critics in a particularly gruesome fashion patterned on ""The Pit and The Pendulum"". The duo race to discover the killer as he leaves a grisly trail of bodies in his wake. Poe's personal life appears to be in shambles as well as he is literally on his last dime waiting for a new review to be published. He also faces resistance from his love Emily's (Alice Eve) father (Brendan Gleeson)as he attempts to court her.James McTiegue (V for Vendetta [Blu-ray] does a nice job of setting up the action sequences and creating an earth atmosphere nicely capturing the era. He also gets the most out of his performers even when their roles are underdeveloped; the character of Alice is sketched in and while her father played by Gleeson has nice presence most of that is due to the actor NOT due to the development of his character. Moving the action along can be done well with good character development and it seems to me that quite a bit was sacrificed in moving this script to the screen. The deleted scenes might have added some additional character development but there still seems to be more that might have been sacrificed to make this a smooth, sleek superficial thriller.END OF SPOILERS:The Blu-ray for ""The Raven"" looks quite nice--the format lends itself well to dark looking movies like this. Detail is remarkably sharp throughout and retains the film-like quality of the movie.Audio is likewise impressive with an immersive 5.1 lossless presentation with nice depth and detail present throughout but with dialogue clear even in the action sequences.We get subtitles in English and Spanish as well.The special features are a mixed bag. We get an interesting sometimes all too clinical audio commentary from director McTeigue and the producers. Still we do get some interesting facts about the production, Poe's mysterious death and some fact vs. fiction moments present throughout the film.We also get a number of featurettes including a brief overview of Poe's life and the circumstances surroudning his death that includes clips from the film focusing on where the fact for this fiction was derived from.""The Raven's Guts"" is largely a superficial behind-the-scenes featurette while ""The Raven Presents John Cusack and James McTiegue"" sees actor and director face off as they discuss what attracted them to the film.""The Raven"" offered quite a bit of potential some of it unrealized; while Cusack will hold your attention in his performance as Poe and he gets able, strong support from a variety of character actors, the film could have been better with more character and plot development.As a fictionalized examination of a serial killer (a term used in the film which wasn't invented until the 1960's)using Poe's work as inspiration and Poe as a crime solving writer, ""The Raven"" manages to be an interesting and entertaining film that could have been much, much more.",3,"Cusack makes ""The Raven"" worthwhile in fictionalized thriller about Edgar Allen Poe's last days",1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,3493,"['Sometimes', 'performance', 'thing', 'case', 'Raven', 'John', 'Cusack', 'frenzied', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'reviews', 'here', 'have', 'confused', 'man', 'character', 'created', 'film', 'so', 'let', 'be', 'clear', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Poe', 'last', 'days', 'nicely', 'feel', 'era.SPOILERS', 'Detective', 'Emmert', 'Fields', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'pressure', 'Poe', 'help', 'find', 'killer', 'author', 'stories', 'template', 'actions', 'Soon', 'clear', 'Fields', 'Poe', 'killer', 'author', 'engaged', 'pursuit', 'one', 'Poe', 'critics', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'fashion', 'patterned', 'Pit', 'Pendulum', 'duo', 'race', 'discover', 'killer', 'grisly', 'trail', 'bodies', 'wake', 'Poe', 'personal', 'life', 'be', 'shambles', 'as', 'well', 'literally', 'last', 'dime', 'waiting', 'new', 'review', 'be', 'published', 'also', 'resistance', 'love', 'Emily', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'father', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'court', 'her.James', 'McTiegue', 'V', 'Vendetta', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'nice', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'action', 'sequences', 'creating', 'earth', 'atmosphere', 'nicely', 'capturing', 'era', 'also', 'most', 'performers', 'even', 'when', 'roles', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'character', 'Alice', 'sketched', 'father', 'played', 'Gleeson', 'nice', 'presence', 'most', 'due', 'actor', 'NOT', 'due', 'development', 'character', 'Moving', 'action', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'well', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'quite', 'bit', 'was', 'sacrificed', 'moving', 'script', 'screen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'might', 'have', 'added', 'additional', 'character', 'development', 'still', 'be', 'more', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'sacrificed', 'make', 'smooth', 'sleek', 'superficial', 'thriller.END', 'SPOILERS', 'Blu-ray', 'Raven', 'quite', 'nice', 'format', 'well', 'dark', 'looking', 'movies', 'Detail', 'remarkably', 'sharp', 'film-like', 'quality', 'movie.Audio', 'likewise', 'impressive', 'immersive', '5.1', 'lossless', 'presentation', 'nice', 'depth', 'detail', 'present', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'even', 'action', 'sequences.We', 'get', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'well.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'get', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'too', 'clinical', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'McTeigue', 'producers', 'Still', 'do', 'get', 'interesting', 'facts', 'production', 'Poe', 'mysterious', 'death', 'fact', 'vs.', 'fiction', 'moments', 'present', 'film.We', 'also', 'get', 'number', 'featurettes', 'including', 'brief', 'overview', 'Poe', 'life', 'circumstances', 'surroudning', 'death', 'clips', 'film', 'focusing', 'where', 'fact', 'fiction', 'was', 'derived', 'Raven', 'Guts', 'largely', 'superficial', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'Raven', 'Presents', 'John', 'Cusack', 'James', 'McTiegue', 'actor', 'director', 'face', 'off', 'discuss', 'what', 'attracted', 'film', 'Raven', 'offered', 'quite', 'bit', 'potential', 'unrealized', 'Cusack', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'performance', 'Poe', 'able', 'strong', 'support', 'variety', 'character', 'actors', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'character', 'plot', 'development.As', 'fictionalized', 'examination', 'serial', 'killer', 'term', 'used', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'invented', '1960', 'using', 'Poe', 'work', 'inspiration', 'Poe', 'crime', 'solving', 'writer', 'Raven', 'be', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'much', 'more']",N/A

And, to a myth-maker or conspiracy theorist, there's nothing more appealing than the missing moment. In this case, McTeigue (no conspiracy theorist, as far as I know) dives into the missing moments before the true death of the near-mythic Edgar Allan Poe.This movie takes on that wholly unknown moment, the lost days before Poe's ill-understood demise. It projects, into that blank space, an adventure far more thrilling than historical records or knowledge of Poe's character can justify. Well, Poe isn't the first famous figure to suffer this posthumous indignity, and I can't believe he'll be the last. The scriptwriters hang an exciting if otherwise ordinary story across that chasm, suspended between known facts, and create a fair adventure. If you ignore the literal, historical Poe, it's actually quite enjoyable.The costume drama is fun, the cat-and-mouse killer theme works well within Poe's oeuvre, and the drama is suitably dramatic.

This film is set in the mid-nineteenth century Baltimore, Maryland, and it appeared to be a fictional account of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe's life. But, the writers of this film seemed to have based the film on few accounts of the real situations surrounding Poe's mysterious death. Prior to that time, Poe was enlisted to help the local law enforcement with the recent deaths and they discovered that the crimes resembled a fictional murder in one of Poe's short stories.After watching this film, I found it quite entertaining and interesting story. I've always have a thing for mysteries and histories, so this film was fun to watch.I have heard of Poe before, but never really read any of his works.

1499631,AB1CKA6B849SP,B005S9EJ8W,zeus,"[0, 0]","Like the five stars say: I LOVE IT!This is a great movie that will keep you on your toes all the way to the end. The movie is a fictional representation of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe. For people who know how he died his last minutes are not a surprise. What is surprising is the plot that gets us there. Although I know and read about Edgar Allan Poe's life and sudden death at the young age of 41, the plot took me by surprise. And for a moment, just a moment, I thought that the movie will have a sequel dealing with Jules Verne's death (who died peacefully in France, at home, from complication of diabetes).The plot is somehow complicated: somebody is murdering people in a brutal manner throughout Baltimore. All gruesome murders follow to the letter the murders described by Poe in one of his books. At the beginning he is a suspect, but it becomes clear soon that someone is copying his books. The mysterious murderer takes his girlfriend hostage, in order to make him write another set of stories that the newspaper must print on the front page every day. While the mystery murderer leaves clues all over the dead bodies, Poe and the police are racing to find his girlfriend because they are told she is in imminent danger. The very end of the movie (...last 20 seconds) are really unexpected and make you jump out of your seat. Once you saw the end, check Poe's last words in real life...The plot may make sense after all!This is a great suspense/thriller movie that is worth the money. A question (that may be a spoiler) for everybody is: why a human hair is attracted to a magnet? Or, why a dollar bill is attracted to a magnet?I was never a fan of John Cusak's acting performances, but this is the first time (as far as I am concerned) that his acting really surprised me and he appeared like a great actor. Not De Niro or Pacino yet, but on his way to this level. In spite of Cusak's name of the cover, I purchased the blu ray because I am fan of Edgar Allan Poe.

1499632,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B005S9EJ8W,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","I am a great fan of Edgar Allan Poe's works and have not only read all of his works but also watched most of the film adaptations' of Poe's works. I find the classic adaptations such asThe Raven,Pit And The Pendulum (1961),Murders in the Rue Morgueand many more to be wonderful adaptations, remaining true to Poe's works. ""The Raven"" starring John Cusack takes a different approach in that it is a fictionalized account of Poe's (Cusack) last days while on the trail of a demented serial killer.The story is set in 19th century Baltimore, and the movie is for the most part set in darkness which is apt considering the heinous nature of the murders. A serial killer is murdering innocents all over the city, and Poe initially comes under suspicion as the murders mirror events in his stories. The downtrodden Poe here is portrayed by John Cusack (whom I felt delivered a less than stellar performance, and I happen to be a fan), a writer who is at the end of his rope because his publisher refuses to publish his poems, preferring his gruesome stories and demanding more of the same. Poe is in love with the lovely Emily (Alice Eve), the daughter of a prominent man, Captain Hamilton (portrayed by Brendan Gleeson). Hamilon disapproves of Poe whom he considers to be vile and beneath their social station, but Emily manages to sneak around and see Poe anyway.The other main character is Inspector Emmett Fields (played by Luke Evans) who realizes that Poe is not his man and decides to bring Poe on to his task force to help them capture the serial killer. The story really takes off after Emily is kidnapped by the killer and the clock starts ticking - Poe and Fields need to piece clues together quickly before Emily suffers a grisly fate at the hands of the killer.The premise drew me in and I liked how Poe's works were woven into the storyline, serving as the link between Cusack's Poe and the killer. The killer is evidently a fan of Poe's works, but I felt the movie never truly delved into the killer's character. By the time the killer's identity is revealed, I felt a sense of disconnect from what was happening on screen - it is difficult for me to get into a movie where I can't connect or understand the central characters and The Raven, which showed much promise in its premise, failed to deliver in terms of character development and a credible plot.",3,Could have been so much more,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,2365,"['am', 'great', 'fan', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'works', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'read', 'works', 'also', 'watched', 'most', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Poe', 'works', 'find', 'classic', 'adaptations', 'such', 'asThe', 'Raven', 'Pit', 'Pendulum', '1961', 'Murders', 'Rue', 'Morgueand', 'many', 'more', 'be', 'wonderful', 'adaptations', 'remaining', 'true', 'Poe', 'works', 'Raven', 'starring', 'John', 'Cusack', 'different', 'approach', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Poe', 'Cusack', 'last', 'days', 'trail', 'demented', 'serial', 'killer.The', 'story', 'set', '19th', 'century', 'Baltimore', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'set', 'darkness', 'apt', 'considering', 'heinous', 'nature', 'murders', 'serial', 'killer', 'murdering', 'innocents', 'city', 'Poe', 'initially', 'suspicion', 'murders', 'mirror', 'events', 'stories', 'downtrodden', 'Poe', 'here', 'portrayed', 'John', 'Cusack', 'whom', 'felt', 'delivered', 'less', 'stellar', 'performance', 'happen', 'be', 'fan', 'writer', 'who', 'end', 'rope', 'publisher', 'publish', 'poems', 'preferring', 'gruesome', 'stories', 'demanding', 'more', 'same', 'Poe', 'love', 'lovely', 'Emily', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'daughter', 'prominent', 'man', 'Captain', 'Hamilton', 'portrayed', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Hamilon', 'Poe', 'whom', 'be', 'vile', 'beneath', 'social', 'station', 'Emily', 'sneak', 'see', 'Poe', 'anyway.The', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'Inspector', 'Emmett', 'Fields', 'played', 'Luke', 'Evans', 'who', 'Poe', 'not', 'man', 'bring', 'Poe', 'task', 'force', 'help', 'capture', 'serial', 'killer', 'story', 'really', 'off', 'Emily', 'kidnapped', 'killer', 'clock', 'ticking', 'Poe', 'Fields', 'need', 'piece', 'clues', 'together', 'quickly', 'Emily', 'grisly', 'fate', 'hands', 'killer.The', 'premise', 'drew', 'liked', 'how', 'Poe', 'works', 'were', 'woven', 'storyline', 'serving', 'link', 'Cusack', 'Poe', 'killer', 'killer', 'evidently', 'fan', 'Poe', 'works', 'felt', 'movie', 'never', 'truly', 'delved', 'killer', 'character', 'time', 'killer', 'identity', 'revealed', 'felt', 'sense', 'disconnect', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'screen', 'difficult', 'get', 'movie', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'connect', 'understand', 'central', 'characters', 'Raven', 'showed', 'much', 'promise', 'premise', 'failed', 'deliver', 'terms', 'character', 'development', 'credible', 'plot']",N/A
