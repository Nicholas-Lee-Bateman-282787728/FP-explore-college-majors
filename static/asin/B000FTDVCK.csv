995873,A1S0SJUFEGOC8J,B000FTDVCK,B. Sounthonevichith,"[2, 2]","Let me just state that this is my third time buying My Sassy Girl. The first time was years ago when I got the official Chinese version off of Ebay. Not really knowing what it was about but liking the sound of the synopsis, I bought it. I immediately fell in love with this movie and after my DVD got scratch and started to skip, I bought the official Korean region 3 version. I now have the official U.S. release of this movie as I wanted to support the company that brought it over so that hopefully more Americans will be able to enjoy this awesome movie. However, this isn't a great release as it just contains the actual movie and nothing else other than chapter selection. The movie itelf is still awesome but there is one thing that makes this release only 4 stars and not the 5 stars it should have been. I knew right away as soon as I flipped the disc over that this was printed on a single layer, DVD 5, instead of a dual layer, DVD 9, disc. This is what kept it from getting 5 stars. You see, as soon as I popped the disc into my computer to see what size the disc was, it only measured slightly more than 4GB while the official Korean region 3 version was closer to 8GB. This makes a huge difference on the picture quality as you can really see the difference between this release and the Korean release. This release looked grainy and not as clear when compared to the Korean release, which looks excellent. The other difference is the fact that this release took out the name Gyunwoo when Gyunwoo was talking and Girl when the Girl was talking. This didn't bother me very much but I've been used to it since I've had the Chinese version and the Korean version subtitled it the same way. So, with this said, is it still worth a buy, yes, especially if you've never seen it before. Even if you had seen it, it's still worth a purchase, if only to support the company so that hopefully, in the future, they'll release other movies we might enjoy. However, if you have a all region player and only want to purchase one version, I would highly recommend the official Korean version. Not a bad purchase for me as now I can let friends of mine borrow it since none of them have region free DVD players. Maybe I'll get them hooked too as this was the movie that got me hooked on Korean movies and dramas.",4,Could have been awesome but...,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,2310,"['Let', 'just', 'state', 'third', 'time', 'buying', 'My', 'Sassy', 'Girl', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'years', 'when', 'got', 'official', 'Chinese', 'version', 'Ebay', 'Not', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'liking', 'sound', 'synopsis', 'bought', 'immediately', 'fell', 'love', 'movie', 'DVD', 'got', 'scratch', 'started', 'skip', 'bought', 'official', 'Korean', 'region', '3', 'version', 'now', 'have', 'official', 'U.S.', 'release', 'movie', 'wanted', 'support', 'company', 'brought', 'over', 'so', 'hopefully', 'more', 'Americans', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'awesome', 'movie', 'However', ""n't"", 'great', 'release', 'just', 'actual', 'movie', 'nothing', 'else', 'other', 'chapter', 'selection', 'movie', 'itelf', 'still', 'awesome', 'one', 'thing', 'release', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'not', '5', 'stars', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'knew', 'right', 'away', 'as', 'soon', 'flipped', 'disc', 'was', 'printed', 'single', 'layer', 'DVD', '5', 'instead', 'dual', 'layer', 'DVD', '9', 'disc', 'what', 'kept', 'getting', '5', 'stars', 'see', 'as', 'soon', 'popped', 'disc', 'computer', 'see', 'what', 'size', 'disc', 'was', 'only', 'measured', 'slightly', 'more', '4GB', 'official', 'Korean', 'region', '3', 'version', 'was', 'closer', '8GB', 'huge', 'difference', 'picture', 'quality', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'difference', 'release', 'Korean', 'release', 'release', 'looked', 'grainy', 'not', 'clear', 'when', 'compared', 'Korean', 'release', 'excellent', 'other', 'difference', 'fact', 'release', 'took', 'out', 'name', 'Gyunwoo', 'when', 'Gyunwoo', 'was', 'talking', 'Girl', 'when', 'Girl', 'was', 'talking', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'very', 'much', ""'ve"", 'been', 'used', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Chinese', 'version', 'Korean', 'version', 'subtitled', 'same', 'way', 'So', 'said', 'still', 'buy', 'yes', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Even', 'had', 'seen', 'still', 'worth', 'purchase', 'only', 'support', 'company', 'so', 'hopefully', 'future', ""'ll"", 'release', 'other', 'movies', 'might', 'enjoy', 'However', 'have', 'region', 'player', 'only', 'want', 'purchase', 'one', 'version', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'official', 'Korean', 'version', 'Not', 'bad', 'purchase', 'now', 'can', 'let', 'friends', 'mine', 'borrow', 'none', 'have', 'region', 'free', 'DVD', 'players', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hooked', 'too', 'was', 'movie', 'got', 'hooked', 'Korean', 'movies', 'dramas']",N/A

The simplified version of the the story is a young man, Gyun-Woo, sees a beautiful (but extremely drunk) woman at the train station. She's teetering on the platform ledge as the train approaches. He pulls her to safety and helps her on the train. He's intrigued by her drunkenness and can't help but watch her...then she vomits on a older man and right before she passes out she call Gyun-woo ""Honey"". So now everybody on the train thinks that she's his girlfriend and scolds him about how he can't take care of his girlfriend, etc. Gyun-woo carries her off the train and to a local motel to let her sleep it off. Things happen and when he gets out of the shower naked (remember he has vomit all over him) the cops bust in and arrest him. The next day the Girl calls him (he's at home now) and wants to talk to him. They meet and she is a very demanding person with a lot of obvious pain inside, but Gyun-woo sees there's something sweet underneath and he wants to ""heal her sorrow"". And that's how their relationship begins.At first the Girl has a wall up around herself and a lot of what she says is lies or misleading, but then as the film moves along and she begins to heal, we (the audience along with Gyun-woo) start to see through her armor and it's absolutely beautiful. That's all of the story you need to know.I really fell in love with this movie and cannot say enough wonderful things about it. The best advice I can give you is to pay attention to everything (the handkerchief, the water, the film scripts she writes and especially [SPOILER?] the special passenger in the train). Also watch it more than once. This movie is a lot deeper and there's much more going on beneath the surface than you think. I kinda felt stupid for not seeing the ending earlier, but sometimes ignorance truly is bliss. :-PI do have a few questions though: [SPOILERS!!!] How come the the older version of Gyun-woo time-travels alone? Where did the frog in the time capsule come from? Was she trying to commit suicide on the anniversary of her ex-boyfriend's death and if so was it his spirit that lead Gyun-woo to her?

995879,AP4167JEAUHIX,B000FTDVCK,"Frank Elliott ""Captain Fitzroy""","[2, 3]","A lot of us enjoy a change of pace as movie buffs. We like cinema from another country. It takes us out of the norm, and permits us some 'arm chair traveling' in a manner of speaking. This is one of those movies. It's a harmless, fun romance between two young people who meet by chance and develop a quirky friendship over time. No literary 'giantness' here-but we weren't expecting it, were we? Just a fun movie about youthful romance. And this one delivers. With another review of an opera on another space on amazon, a reviewer described the failed performace of that opera as being something like a high school play...a little smaltzy/hokey and a poorly acted cheapo, by inference in his review. Well that's a little academic elitism at play there in that haughty review, actually.  Whenever teens are involved, we sort of expect things to be, how can I put this politely?...not very deep intellectually? Nor is the story line or acting in thsi movie particularly ""acadamy awardish"". This movie might fall into that category, if you are one of those academic elitists. However, all that ""put down"" being said, this movie manages to redeem itself by sheer innocence of its story-in tandem with the innocence of the young people starring in it. The young girl , the story goes, has lost a loved one to an unexpected illness and death for some unknown reason; and for this reason goes rather off the deep end emotionally. This is when our hapless young man comes along to sort of mop up the drunken mess, and get her to a, gasp, hotel, and clean her up and get her safely home. Understand that there is no sexual intimacy between them at all...for the entire story. In a real sense it takes us all back to a more innocent time. She amuses herself by writing script outlines for movies, based upon the stupid movies for teens we so often see churned out by the truckload. The idea being, ""If teenagers keep buying this crap, I guess we will just keep turning this crap out"". The young man, however, writes the story of their romance in the form of a screenplay, that actually gets the attention of a movie producer-and becomes a real movie. This movie! So there are several layer happening all at once with this. It is seemingly at first glance, just another silly teenage romance. I can't tell much more without giving it away. But I will say this: one of the signs of good literature is when after a long series of apparently unrelated, stupid, dumb nutty scenes - all comes together in the final few moments , to coalesce into something sublime, tender and beautiful?..Hmm?.this is good literature!  This is a surprisingly good movie-although part way through you may find yourself asking why you are even watching this silly romp. In the end, you will be very glad you bought this one.

995880,A36H16ZJXUIMZG,B000FTDVCK,"Gene Cisco ""Moon Man""","[0, 0]","""My Sassy Girl,"" another Korean romantic comedy import is surprisingly old-fashioned and unpredictable. In fact, it is one of the most painful takes on the battle of the sexes while being quite sweet. Besides it covers quite a lot of territory in the battle for true love. What begins as an accidental pairing of the two unlikely lovers takes many twists and turns before reaching the most surprising climax of modern love, both participants innocent to the end. Does it address only the young? No. How Korea found two appealing actors (equivalent to Jimmy Stewart/Margaret Sullivan) though played by Tae hyn Cha and Ji-hyun Jun, adept at light comedy with such charm is quite amazing. While the romance involves two students with parents, the story avoids insulting tradition, courtship and honor to get laughs and allows the adults to assist the spatting lovers who spend half the movie tormenting themselves in a comedic way which, too, gets explained to powerful impact. This is surely a contemporary classic for various reasons including its fine casting. The script starts with the difficulties of courtship following a drunken accident (it too gets explained )until the chemistry borders on sado/masochism while each lingering strand of doubt gets explained gradually,rising upward into the spiritual realm contemplating fate, suspended where only the viewer realizes their actual attraction. Just when they are separated (by fate again?)a third person brings the two together with a triple effect. Home run. Delightfully hit out of the romantic ballpark.

And that should have been the English title cuz that's the main attraction. Like the old screwball comedies, its about the misadventures of a hapless guy who gets caught up with a tough, willful girl. At times he wants to avoid this badly behaving girl with a mysterious past, however pretty she is. That's sensible. She doesn't seem to like him. She constantly threatens him with ""wanna die?"" And she punches him at will.While some facets of the story aren't as polished as the rest, it's largely unpredictable with skilled direction and hugely appealing actors (Jun Ji-hyun as the girl and Cha Tae-hyun as the guy).

After seeing this, I have become a fan of Korean Romantic Comedy movies and TV series. i am Asian so it's so good to know that not only Western movie makers can make such quality films.my favorite thing about this movie is the fact that it's not a movie that's purely based on the lines, but also on the expressions on their faces. i think that's become a Korean trend. (i just love kyun woo's constipated look whenever his girlfriend surprises him.) i think everything that the sassy girl makes kyun woo do are really cute -- like doing a home run in heels, the theme park fiasco, the left-right foot game, the reading of the therapeutic scripts are just some. i never thought for a second that she is mean, i think she's just a little twisted - in a good way.the movie is separated in three parts- like a basketball game, first and second half and then the overtime part. the first half of the film is the hilarious and funny part. they meet up in a subway train, the girl was drunk, threw up on someone's wig, picking fights, etc. etc. it wasn't really your typical romantic 'first meetings.' a unique friendship started, which eventually led to a 'relationship.' it was such a mystery that a geeky kid like kyun woo will end up with a boyish and bully girl who is so pretty and so angelic, if not for her temper and her ways.on the second half of the film, the two had an unofficial break-up. it was during this part of the movie that a different part of the girl was shown. she had problems at home with her family. aside from that, the reason why she always get drunk is because of a boy she fell in love with who looks so much like kyun woo but died. kyun woo and the girl buried a time capsule under a tree before they separated ways. they promised to see each other again in three years. it sounds cheesy but it did work for the film.the overtime is the time which tells how they have changed and matured apart. it also contains a twist that i swear i didn't see coming. it may sound so unrealistic but you can't question Fate. if you two are really meant to be together, no amount of time or distance can keep you apart.",5,a new breed of rom-com from Korea,1265155200,"02 3, 2010",2010,2231,"['movie', 'was', 'recommended', 'friend', 'was', 'first', 'Korean', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Ive', 'ever', 'watched', 'seeing', 'have', 'become', 'fan', 'Korean', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'i', 'am', 'Asian', 'so', 'good', 'know', 'not', 'only', 'Western', 'movie', 'makers', 'can', 'make', 'such', 'quality', 'films.my', 'favorite', 'thing', 'movie', 'fact', 'not', 'movie', 'purely', 'based', 'lines', 'also', 'expressions', 'i', 'think', 'become', 'Korean', 'trend', 'i', 'just', 'love', 'kyun', 'woo', 'constipated', 'look', 'whenever', 'girlfriend', 'i', 'think', 'everything', 'sassy', 'girl', 'kyun', 'woo', 'do', 'are', 'really', 'cute', 'doing', 'home', 'run', 'heels', 'theme', 'park', 'fiasco', 'left-right', 'foot', 'game', 'reading', 'therapeutic', 'scripts', 'are', 'just', 'i', 'never', 'thought', 'second', 'mean', 'i', 'think', 'just', 'little', 'twisted', 'good', 'way.the', 'movie', 'separated', 'three', 'parts-', 'basketball', 'game', 'first', 'second', 'half', 'then', 'overtime', 'part', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'hilarious', 'funny', 'part', 'meet', 'up', 'subway', 'train', 'girl', 'was', 'drunk', 'threw', 'up', 'someone', 'wig', 'picking', 'fights', 'etc', 'etc', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'typical', 'romantic', 'meetings', 'unique', 'friendship', 'started', 'eventually', 'led', ""'relationship"", 'was', 'such', 'mystery', 'geeky', 'kid', 'kyun', 'woo', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'boyish', 'bully', 'girl', 'who', 'so', 'pretty', 'so', 'angelic', 'not', 'temper', 'ways.on', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'two', 'had', 'unofficial', 'break-up', 'was', 'part', 'movie', 'different', 'part', 'girl', 'was', 'shown', 'had', 'problems', 'home', 'family', 'aside', 'reason', 'why', 'always', 'get', 'drunk', 'boy', 'fell', 'love', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'kyun', 'woo', 'died', 'kyun', 'woo', 'girl', 'buried', 'time', 'capsule', 'tree', 'separated', 'ways', 'promised', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'three', 'years', 'cheesy', 'did', 'work', 'film.the', 'overtime', 'time', 'how', 'have', 'changed', 'matured', 'apart', 'also', 'twist', 'i', 'swear', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'may', 'sound', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'question', 'Fate', 'two', 'are', 'really', 'meant', 'be', 'together', 'amount', 'time', 'distance', 'can', 'keep', 'apart']",N/A

995894,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B000FTDVCK,Muzzlehatch,"[1, 2]","First a word on editions:  the longest, ""director's"" cut of this film runs approximately 137 minutes, and that's the version I purchased through this site, manufactured by Bonzai Media Corporation - apparently unavailable at the moment - though my Amazon Verified Purchase shows the PRP version.  I've only seen the DC and not the shorter version; it's hard to ascertain which is which with this title given that there are American, Taiwanese, Japanese and Korean DVDs available and not all of them have adequate details listed.  So look carefully at all the options - which may change frequently.The story:A somewhat geeky engineering student, Gyeon-woo (Cha Tae-hyun) encounters a drunk and obnoxious, never-named girl (Jun Ji-hyun) on a commuter train and through his combined feelings of responsibility, passivity, and (surprisingly low-key) lust ends up becoming her savior, protector, and eventually a sort of boyfriend. She remains dominant and domineering, rude, and thoughtless through much of the film, though even early on it rarely seems that she's outright cruel - just immature and perhaps somewhat spoiled (confirmed when we find out that her family is clearly wealthier and of a higher class than Gyeon-woo's clearly middle-class roots). Will she ever treat him right? Will he grow a spine? This is the stuff of every romantic comedy ever.But ""My Sassy Girl"" is not every romantic comedy ever. The spectacular performances from the two leads, a remarkable sense of pacing (despite the film running almost 2 1/2 hours there's not a moment where it lags), and the consistent inventiveness of director/coscreenwriter Kwak in taking us all over the map emotionally (and all over the map from urban to suburban to countryside and back again) give us in the end two of the most memorable characters in a ""chick flick"" that I've ever seen.  I've seen quite a few Korean films but this probably makes the best use of Seoul as a location in my viewing experience, and in fact it's one of the best ""city films"" I've seen, with a real feel for the milieu - subways, restaurants, natural areas, a couple of quite distinctive residential neighborhoods, and an amusement park, among other places.  And there are all the fantasy sequences that the would be writer ""girl"" dreams up, which take us to a whole other range of places.While the wonderful range of locations and dream-fantasies adds vibrancy to the film, this is at heart the story of any couple of young people struggling with maturity, with the palette of emotions and situations here is much broader, and the storyline meanders in much more unusual directions than most.  If you're impatient, or require more ""realism"" or more conventionally likable characters, you may not be enthralled as I was; and if you've not encountered the Korean penchant for melodrama, which intrudes at various points in the narrative and largely takes over in it's last quarter...well, don't say I didn't warn you.So I warned you.  But this is my review, and so I'll end it by saying: likely the best romantic comedy of the past 25 years.",5,"The defining 2000s Korean rom-com, unmatched by most western competitors",1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,3081,"['First', 'word', 'editions', 'longest', 'director', 'cut', 'film', 'approximately', '137', 'minutes', 'version', 'purchased', 'site', 'manufactured', 'Bonzai', 'Media', 'Corporation', 'apparently', 'unavailable', 'moment', 'Amazon', 'Verified', 'Purchase', 'PRP', 'version', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'DC', 'not', 'shorter', 'version', 'hard', 'ascertain', 'title', 'given', 'are', 'American', 'Taiwanese', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'DVDs', 'available', 'not', 'have', 'adequate', 'details', 'listed', 'look', 'carefully', 'options', 'may', 'change', 'frequently.The', 'story', 'somewhat', 'geeky', 'engineering', 'student', 'Gyeon-woo', 'Cha', 'Tae-hyun', 'drunk', 'obnoxious', 'never-named', 'girl', 'Jun', 'Ji-hyun', 'commuter', 'train', 'combined', 'feelings', 'responsibility', 'passivity', 'surprisingly', 'low-key', 'lust', 'up', 'becoming', 'savior', 'protector', 'eventually', 'sort', 'boyfriend', 'dominant', 'domineering', 'rude', 'thoughtless', 'much', 'film', 'though', 'even', 'early', 'rarely', 'outright', 'cruel', 'just', 'immature', 'perhaps', 'somewhat', 'spoiled', 'confirmed', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'family', 'clearly', 'wealthier', 'higher', 'class', 'Gyeon-woo', 'clearly', 'middle-class', 'roots', 'Will', 'ever', 'treat', 'right', 'Will', 'grow', 'spine', 'stuff', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Sassy', 'Girl', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'ever', 'spectacular', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'remarkable', 'sense', 'pacing', 'film', 'running', 'almost', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'not', 'moment', 'where', 'consistent', 'inventiveness', 'director/coscreenwriter', 'Kwak', 'taking', 'map', 'emotionally', 'map', 'urban', 'suburban', 'countryside', 'back', 'again', 'give', 'end', 'two', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'chick', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'Korean', 'films', 'probably', 'best', 'use', 'Seoul', 'location', 'viewing', 'experience', 'fact', 'one', 'best', 'city', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'real', 'feel', 'milieu', 'subways', 'restaurants', 'natural', 'areas', 'couple', 'quite', 'distinctive', 'residential', 'neighborhoods', 'amusement', 'park', 'other', 'places', 'are', 'fantasy', 'would', 'be', 'writer', 'girl', 'up', 'take', 'whole', 'other', 'range', 'wonderful', 'range', 'locations', 'dream-fantasies', 'vibrancy', 'film', 'heart', 'story', 'couple', 'young', 'people', 'struggling', 'maturity', 'palette', 'emotions', 'situations', 'here', 'much', 'broader', 'storyline', 'meanders', 'much', 'more', 'unusual', 'directions', 'most', ""'re"", 'impatient', 'require', 'more', 'realism', 'more', 'conventionally', 'likable', 'characters', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enthralled', 'was', ""'ve"", 'not', 'encountered', 'Korean', 'penchant', 'melodrama', 'various', 'points', 'narrative', 'largely', 'over', 'last', 'quarter', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn', 'you.So', 'warned', 'review', 'so', ""'ll"", 'end', 'saying', 'likely', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'past', '25', 'years']",N/A

However, it was not available at that time as a Region 1 DVD.  I later learned that Hollywood bought the rights to the film and it would no longer be distributed in the U.S.  Well, this fall I saw that it was available on Amazon.com and I immediately jumped at the chance to purchase it.  Even at about $[...] (to get an original manufacturer version and not a reproduction), it was worth both the price and the wait!I own almost 300 DVDs and 87 of them are foreign language films.  ""My Sassy Girl"" ranks up there among the classics and it is the best romantic comedy that I've ever seen.  My wife (who is luke-warm on many foreign films) absolutely loved it as well.  I find it hard to believe that the Hollywood version coming out in 2007 will be able to hold a candle to the Korean language version (2001).This film is an absolutely wonderful story (which explains why Hollywood bought the rights to it).  It hits on all cylinders -- the movie moves along at a nice pace, it is genuinely funny, and you grow to really like the characters by the end.  I can't recommend this one enough, as it ranks in my top ten favorite movies of all time.  It's worth many repeat viewings, which not many movies can claim.

995907,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000FTDVCK,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[30, 31]","I do not like romantic teen comedies; I occasionally see one only when I'm with a date. I think teen romantic comedies are so full of clich&eacute;s and stereotypical characters, the premise of most I've seen is so predictable and need I say it? DULL. However, almost three years ago, I came across ""My SASSY GIRL"" which came highly recommended by a friend. Directed by Kwak Jae-Young, it is loosely based on real-life experiences of Kim Ho-Sik, which he posted as an internet serial called ""YupKi Girl"". Did I like ""My Sassy Girl""? Yes, in fact, I loved it. (This is my first shot reviewing a ""chick flick"" so don't laugh)Synopsis based on dvd back cover:One night, Gyun-woo (Pop Star Chae Tae-Yeon), a young student comes across a terribly drunken girl (Jeon Ji-Hyeon). He feels very awkward to help her but when he does, a deep sense of responsibility has been developed within him; he decides to heal her pain. Even though she slaps him, pushed him into a pool, forces him to wear her high heels, he tolerates everything. Will she stay with him after the pain is healed?Now, why do I find this South Korean romantic comedy so remarkable? The film is very enjoyable and quite unpredictable. It is well developed as a love story with well-rounded characters that you can really care about. It doesn't take the easy road to humor such as the typical jokes of sexual nature inherent in other teen comedies. Also, the perfectly timed humor adds a lot of zest in the proceedings and plus there is the beautiful and unforgettable Korean female lead; Korean Bombshell Jeon Ji-Hyeon.The film revolves around two main characters, sure, there are supporting ones such as aunts, parents, rogue soldier and schoolmates. The film really makes an effort for the viewers to become well acquainted with Gyun-woo and the unnamed girl. While the film's premise is very simple, there are a lot of subtle details present that really kept me interested. The first half contains most of the funny moments and it successfully forms an attachment to its viewers. The humor doesn't require an understanding of Korean culture and is very easy to pick up.  The second half has the melodramatic moments (This is a Korean film) and the film TRULY succeeds in its emotional impact because the drama works and blends well with the rest of the film and its characters.The Girl (Jeon Ji-Hyeon) is one of the most bizarre characters I've come across; sometimes she is cute and lovable but she can have that humorous creepy feel. She is crazy! How can a gorgeous girl be so lovable and likeable at the same time violent and disturbed? Jeon Ji-Hyeon won acting awards for her portrayal of the unnamed girl. After ""IlMare"" (U.S. remake; The Lake House), My Sassy Girl catapulted her to superstardom. Chae Te-Yeon is a pop star but does a tremendous performance bringing Gyun-woo's character to life. I really liked his funny facial expressions!! He really gave life to his character as a victim-boyfriend, every humiliatingly awkward moment is a funny one that at the same time I almost pitied his plight but at the same time enjoyed it. Their warm chemistry is so effective that you can't help but connect with them.The film is also visually pleasant to the eyes. Some of the backdrop may seem a bit cartoonish and quite colorful but I think it doesn't hurt the proceedings. The camera positioning is also perfect, it adds that extra touch to make the funny moments even more humorous and memorable. I don't want to point out the highlights because it may spoil the film's developments.There you go. I reviewed my first-ever-romantic comedy and survived. To be honest, I was drawn to this film because of Jeon Ji-Hyeon. Little did I know that watching ""My Sassy Girl"" (again) would turn out to be one of the most fun I've had watching a dvd in awhile. (It's a good break from all the dark films I've seen of late) People who are looking for crude humor will be disappointed.  The film's excellent pacing and the truly effective twist in the last act makes this Korean comedy one of the best ""feel good"" flicks and has become an essential part of my DVD collection. If you like ""sweet"" and clever romance; this film is a can't miss!I still dislike teen romantic comedies, ""My Sassy Girl"" is the exception to the rule. (This film came before ""Windstruck"" but made such an impact with the Korean audience that the last scene in ""Windstruck"" gave a hint of a relation to this film in the last scene although it has no relation to it)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! [4  stars]RECENT NEWS: The U.S. will be remaking ""My Sassy Girl"" for the American audience with the working title: ""Date me if you Dare"". Jeon Ji-Hyeon will be starring in the live-action adaptation of the Japanese anime: ""Blood the Last Vampire"".",4,"A Clever, enjoyable and unpredictable romantic comedy",1195344000,"11 18,
