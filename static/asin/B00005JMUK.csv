622390,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00005JMUK,,"[4, 4]","Aileen (Charlize Theron) has lived most of her life waiting to be discovered in a similar way to Marilyn Monroe, but this never happened. She ended up blowing guys for five bucks in the back seat of their cars, living out of a storage room, taking baths in the sinks of public restrooms and trying to survive. She has really nothing to cheer her up, until one day she walks into a gay bar and meets Selby (Christina Ricci). They quickly become friends and even more, but not before Aileen recanted some statements she made due to her being a compulsive liar.When things go south with one of her clients, Aileen ends up killing the man after being brutally abused. From that point on we can see her rage towards her clients and her desire to ""punish"" them for being what they are. Or maybe she is angry with herself for having to do this job and takes it out on them. She does try to change paths though, mainly due to her love for Selby. She wants to take care of her partner's need, but finds no help whatsoever when looking for a job. So, back to the old work...and hello serial killer.There are several things about this movie that make it brilliant, with Theron's performance right at the top of the list. For an actress that is usually involved in representing classy and beautiful women, it must be a real challenge to play the role of Aileen. Part of the credit has to go to the make-up artists though, who made possible an incredible transformation.The other point that I think is worth mentioning is the quality of the script, since the story takes us inside the mind of the serial killer. It is fascinating to understand the motives and reasons behind her actions. I can understand though that people that have been touched by the effects of Wuornos' crimes are not interested in this and may resent it. Also, I am not sure about how much of what is presented is fiction. In my mind, even if part of the ""facts"" presented are fiction, this movie is a high quality creation and a very interesting option to consider the next time you plan to sit in front of the TV for a couple of hours.",5,"""I am a really good person, right?""",1103500800,"12 20, 2004",2004,2096,"['Aileen', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'lived', 'most', 'life', 'waiting', 'be', 'discovered', 'similar', 'way', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'never', 'happened', 'ended', 'up', 'blowing', 'guys', 'five', 'bucks', 'back', 'seat', 'cars', 'living', 'storage', 'room', 'taking', 'baths', 'sinks', 'public', 'restrooms', 'trying', 'survive', 'really', 'nothing', 'cheer', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'gay', 'bar', 'meets', 'Selby', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'quickly', 'become', 'friends', 'even', 'more', 'not', 'Aileen', 'recanted', 'statements', 'made', 'due', 'being', 'compulsive', 'liar.When', 'things', 'go', 'south', 'one', 'clients', 'Aileen', 'up', 'killing', 'man', 'being', 'brutally', 'abused', 'point', 'can', 'see', 'rage', 'clients', 'desire', 'punish', 'being', 'what', 'are', 'maybe', 'angry', 'having', 'do', 'job', 'out', 'try', 'change', 'paths', 'mainly', 'due', 'love', 'Selby', 'take', 'care', 'partner', 'need', 'help', 'whatsoever', 'when', 'looking', 'job', 'So', 'back', 'old', 'work', 'hello', 'serial', 'killer.There', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'movie', 'make', 'brilliant', 'Theron', 'performance', 'right', 'top', 'list', 'actress', 'usually', 'involved', 'representing', 'classy', 'beautiful', 'women', 'must', 'be', 'real', 'challenge', 'play', 'role', 'Aileen', 'Part', 'credit', 'go', 'make-up', 'artists', 'who', 'made', 'possible', 'incredible', 'transformation.The', 'other', 'point', 'think', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'quality', 'script', 'story', 'mind', 'serial', 'killer', 'fascinating', 'understand', 'motives', 'reasons', 'actions', 'can', 'understand', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'touched', 'effects', 'Wuornos', 'crimes', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'may', 'resent', 'Also', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'what', 'presented', 'fiction', 'mind', 'even', 'part', 'facts', 'presented', 'are', 'fiction', 'movie', 'high', 'quality', 'creation', 'very', 'interesting', 'option', 'consider', 'next', 'time', 'plan', 'sit', 'front', 'TV', 'couple', 'hours']",Monster
622391,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JMUK,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 1]","'Monster' is a marvelous movie because Charlie Theron plays her character with such thorough knowledge and conviction that we are convinced that we're watching prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos like it was done the first time.  Add to the fact that writer/director Patty Jenkins makes all the right moves to tell the story without softening or sermonizing, and you have yourself a movie classic.  Surely, it's not easy stuff to take in, but it's so interesting, one becomes glued to the heartaching tragedy in every detail.  Much like 'Dead Man Walking,' this film brims with authenticity and assembles itself with an unflinching camera and leaves the audience to judge in its aftermath.Having been a prostitute since age 13 and having been disowned and abused in numerous ways, Aileen can only earn a living on the way she was brought up.  Having to face a particularly nasty ""John"" she overreacts but at least has a plausible self-defense argument to muster.  Having a desperate challenge for tenderness and money, she comes upon a lesbian, Shelby (played with excellent tension by Christina Ricci) from a devout Christian household when she stumbles into a gay bar.  Trying a little tenderness her occupation lacks, she enters a relationship her original proclivities forbade.  Finding rare compassion her storage unit landlord, Tom (played effectively by Bruce Dern) and striking a partnership with Shelby, she, nevertheless, goes down a slippery slope; one that makes her a modern MacBeth with more fate following her than ambition.It can't be said enough how well-rounded and detailed Theron's performance is made.  Capturing pathos and desperation, 'Monster' reveals the rationalizations and roadblocks that make this story such a masterpiece in unsettling anguish.",5,Effective Tragedy in  Desperation,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,1782,"[""'Monster"", 'marvelous', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'Theron', 'character', 'such', 'knowledge', 'conviction', 'are', 'convinced', ""'re"", 'watching', 'prostitute', 'serial', 'killer', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'done', 'first', 'time', 'Add', 'fact', 'writer/director', 'Patty', 'Jenkins', 'right', 'moves', 'tell', 'story', 'softening', 'sermonizing', 'have', 'movie', 'classic', 'Surely', 'not', 'easy', 'stuff', 'take', 'so', 'interesting', 'one', 'glued', 'heartaching', 'tragedy', 'detail', 'Much', ""'Dead"", 'Man', 'Walking', 'film', 'authenticity', 'unflinching', 'camera', 'audience', 'judge', 'aftermath.Having', 'been', 'prostitute', 'age', '13', 'having', 'been', 'disowned', 'abused', 'numerous', 'ways', 'Aileen', 'can', 'only', 'earn', 'living', 'way', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'Having', 'face', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'John', 'least', 'plausible', 'self-defense', 'argument', 'muster', 'Having', 'desperate', 'challenge', 'tenderness', 'money', 'lesbian', 'Shelby', 'played', 'excellent', 'tension', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'devout', 'Christian', 'household', 'when', 'gay', 'bar', 'Trying', 'little', 'tenderness', 'occupation', 'lacks', 'relationship', 'original', 'proclivities', 'forbade', 'Finding', 'rare', 'compassion', 'storage', 'unit', 'landlord', 'Tom', 'played', 'effectively', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'striking', 'partnership', 'Shelby', 'nevertheless', 'down', 'slippery', 'slope', 'one', 'modern', 'MacBeth', 'more', 'fate', 'following', 'ambition.It', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'enough', 'how', 'well-rounded', 'detailed', 'Theron', 'performance', 'made', 'Capturing', 'pathos', 'desperation', 'reveals', 'rationalizations', 'roadblocks', 'make', 'story', 'masterpiece', 'unsettling', 'anguish']",Monster

622393,AHC2ATRQRWNT5,B00005JMUK,"Adam J. Wishman ""Broadway Bound""","[2, 2]","Patty Jenkins' directorial and screenwriting debut is one heck of a start. She certainly has a future in Hollywood. But let's get down to the real heart of this film. The performance of Charlize Theron as America's first femal serial killer Aileen Wuornos is astonishing. It has been hailed as &quot;one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema.&quot; And it truly is. Watching Theron in this movie is like watching a master's class in acting. This is truly what acting is all about. For not one second of this film, did I see Charlize Theron on the screen, I always saw her character. The utterly amazing and phenomenal transformation of Charlize Theron who is quite possibly the most beautiful woman alive into this gritty, disturbing, violent, and unkempt killer is something who any film buff must see. Theron's performance will never be forgotten, and will certainly go down as one the greatest ever. I must also pay tribute to the unsung hero of this film, Christina Ricci. Since Theron was so brilliant, Ricci took the backseat for this film. But it must be noted the Ricci gave a powerhouse performance, and held her own playing off Theron. As far as owning this film, I think it is worth owning. It must be said that this is not a movie that can be watched over and over. It is just way too disturbing and unsettling to watch many times. However I think it is worth owning to own the amazing performance of Theron. It is much like Adrian Brody in &quot;The Pianist&quot; These movies are worth owning for their truly brilliant acting, writing, and directing. Charlize Theron like Adrian Brody took home the Best Actress/Best Actor Oscar for her performance. And she so deserved it. Theron was also honored with the Golden Globe, and SAG (screen actor's guild) awards for &quot;Monster&quot; Make sure you catch this critically aclaimed, and truly brilliant film.

622395,A3IAP2JMTP5YBN,B00005JMUK,"adriana ""alisa""","[2, 3]","A while ago, I wrote a slightly hysterical review because the first time I saw the film, I was completely taken aback by Theron's performance. Now I'm able to write a more rational review.Now I disagree with some of the reviewers that state that this film induced too much sympathy in Aileen's favor(by now I'm sure we all know who that is,lol). I think that the director actually did a good job with that facet. One minute, I found Aileen truly despicable, and the next, I felt inexpressible sorrow for her, and how her life had formed.People who were dissapointed that this movie wasn't ""factual"" enough, need to go rent a documentary. I don't think it was the film's point to lay out all the facts on the table, this movie wanted to focus more on the psychological side of things, and Aileen's personal struggle. And it does a very good job of doing that. What bothered me were the voice-overs on Theron's part.They were cliche, and completely pointless; Theron's performance provided enough insight into Wuornos, and the voice overs were just too much, I felt.What REALLY bothered me was the director's choice to make Aileen's trial,and the outcome seem trivial, and lightheaded. You don't see anything of the trial, and then when Aileen is convicted, some booming, Bruce Springsteen style rock anthem comes on. Suddenly all the emotion you were feeling is shifted by some 80's tune.It was really out of place.But, of course, the whole thing works thanks to Theron's magnificent performance. The hype is true, and the academy honored her with a well deserved oscar just recently. She completely becomes this character, and I'm not just talking about the physical part of it either; she adopts all her mannerisms,and traits making it seem like the woman on screen is a true human being, and just a gorgeous Hollywood starlet with 30 extra pounds on. Her performance is real, and raw, and completely riveting. She completely takes over and works this movie around herself. Christina Ricci was underrated, and totally excellent as Aileen's lover. She played her role off with not a bump in the road.All in all, this movie is saved by a very  strong supporting role, and a fearless,wonderful leading one.",4,Theron's Performance is Ferocious,1079049600,"03 12, 2004",2004,2204,"['while', 'ago', 'wrote', 'slightly', 'hysterical', 'review', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'completely', 'taken', 'aback', 'Theron', 'performance', 'Now', ""'m"", 'able', 'write', 'more', 'rational', 'review.Now', 'disagree', 'reviewers', 'state', 'film', 'induced', 'too', 'much', 'sympathy', 'Aileen', 'favor', 'now', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', 'who', 'lol', 'think', 'director', 'actually', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'facet', 'One', 'minute', 'found', 'Aileen', 'truly', 'despicable', 'next', 'felt', 'inexpressible', 'sorrow', 'how', 'life', 'had', 'formed.People', 'who', 'were', 'dissapointed', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'factual', 'enough', 'need', 'go', 'rent', 'documentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'film', 'point', 'lay', 'out', 'facts', 'table', 'movie', 'wanted', 'focus', 'more', 'psychological', 'side', 'things', 'Aileen', 'personal', 'struggle', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'doing', 'What', 'bothered', 'were', 'voice-overs', 'Theron', 'part.They', 'were', 'cliche', 'completely', 'pointless', 'Theron', 'performance', 'provided', 'enough', 'insight', 'Wuornos', 'voice', 'overs', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'felt.What', 'REALLY', 'bothered', 'was', 'director', 'choice', 'make', 'Aileen', 'trial', 'outcome', 'seem', 'trivial', 'lightheaded', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'trial', 'then', 'when', 'Aileen', 'convicted', 'booming', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'style', 'rock', 'anthem', 'Suddenly', 'emotion', 'were', 'feeling', 'shifted', '80', 'tune.It', 'was', 'really', 'place.But', 'course', 'whole', 'thing', 'thanks', 'Theron', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'hype', 'true', 'academy', 'honored', 'well', 'deserved', 'oscar', 'just', 'recently', 'completely', 'character', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'physical', 'part', 'mannerisms', 'traits', 'making', 'seem', 'woman', 'screen', 'true', 'human', 'being', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'Hollywood', 'starlet', '30', 'extra', 'pounds', 'performance', 'real', 'raw', 'completely', 'riveting', 'completely', 'movie', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'was', 'underrated', 'totally', 'excellent', 'Aileen', 'lover', 'played', 'role', 'off', 'not', 'bump', 'road.All', 'movie', 'saved', 'very', 'strong', 'supporting', 'role', 'fearless', 'wonderful', 'leading', 'one']",Monster

He strikes a match.  BOOM! Daffy evaporates!  The crowd goes wild!  As his spirit floats away Bugs compliments Daffy: ""Great, Daffy. Absolutely brilliant!""  Daffy thanks his pal and lamentingly responds: ""Thanks.  There's only one problem.

She gave Aileen a story a voice and showed what it was like from her perspective and why she did the things she did. You can actually sympathize with Aileen and feel her pain at points in the film. But towards the end you dont know what to feel because she keeps killing innocent men. You still feel a little bit sympathetic for her even after what she has done, this film really makes you think about right and wrong and people in general. It makes you not so quick to judge others circumstances because you dont know what they are going through. All in all this is an excellant movie with great performances by all. Aileen finally has some recogniton.Wouldnt say its good recognition but it portrays her as more than a monster but also a human. All she wanted was To have a chance and im sure if she can see this now she would be happy for once in her life to have her story told and to be understood.

622402,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JMUK,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","One thing I'd never thought I'd see was Charlize Theron holding an acting Oscar.  That isn't meant to be an insult to the actress; it's just to say that based on her filmography I didn't expect her to be handed such an iconic role.  The iconic role that I am referring to is of course her brilliant turn as Aileen Wuornos, the hooker turned serial killer, in Patty Jenkins `Monster'.When you watch Theron in `Monster' you are immediately blown away by the physical transformation she undertook.  All her undeniable beauty (she is one of the most spellbinding beauties in Hollywood) is stripped bare of her to expose the ugliness that consumed this woman.  Her skin is yellowed and loose; her eyes are small and beady; her hair is thin and coarse; her voice is gruff yet vulnerable; her waist has expanded...but beyond any prosthetics there lies a `performance' for the ages.  Charlize Theron brilliantly captured the woman that was Aileen Wuornos.  Her mannerisms, her speech, her attitude; everything that she was is projected on the audience with reckless abandon.`Monster' recounts the events that led up to Wuornos arrestment and first death sentence (she received five more before her execution).  We see her lifestyle, most elements forced upon her by her childhood and early adolescence.  We see her desperation and apathy, both of which root themselves in her actions.  Then she meets Selby (based on Aileen's real life lover Tyra), a young nave girl who just wants someone to love her.  Wuornos is in a way just like Selby.  She has never truly been loved or understood by anyone, always being rejected and thrown away so-to-speak and so they immediately form a close bond, but that bond is tested almost as soon as it is formed.After a brutal attack Wuornos discovers her inner monster.  In order to preserve her life and her hope of a future with Selby she murders her attacker in what proves to be the most intense and moving moment in the film (that one scene to me is what sealed Theron's Oscar...heartbreaking).  After crossing that line she finds that it's the most awful and grotesque things in life that prove to be the easiest to carry out.  Aileen has been degraded and abused since her conception but in the flash of the gun she finds that becoming the monster is so much easier then remaining the victim.  Determined to stop hooking altogether she runs off with Selby to start her life, but without an income and under pressure from Selby to `provide' for her she returns to the streets, this time with a new agenda.  Aileen has no intentions of giving these men anything more than a bullet.I had really known nothing about Aileen Wuornos when I first saw `Monster' but since watching this film I've seen two documentaries and read some articles on her.  While the film for the most part remains true to Wuornos case there are some Hollywood fragmentations that can alter our perspective of this woman.  What is fact is that she was a very tortured woman who in the end snapped under the crushing powers of frustration and heartbreak.  She had lost so much, but then again never really had that much to begin with.  Her life was one never-ending slide towards pain and suffering and she couldn't take it anymore.  She was betrayed by the ones she loved and as the final frames capture her anguish as Selby testifies against her we are brought to the purest of sympathies for this convicted killer.The film as a whole works in a devastating way, but a lot of this is due to Theron's magnificent performance.  Unlike `Boys Don't Cry', I don't feel `Monster' would have worked without Theron.  There are moments, especially towards the center of the film, that are almost `soap operaish' and that take away from the steely darkness of the film.  Parts move slower than they should and this can take away from overall impact of the film.  Once the film starts to spiral towards its climax though it never lets up.  The initial murder marks a moment of change not only in Aileen but in the film itself.  As we watch her scream and cry and parade around in utter misery and hostile confusion it's as if a switch goes off and the films pace starts to shift.Jenkins is no Pierce (that is to say Kimberly Pierce, director of `Boys Don't Cry') but she does manage to extract Theron's finest performance ever; and by `ever' I mean `EVER'.Aside from Theron there are some other well established performances.  Christina Ricci (an actress I expect one day to hold an Oscar) turns in a very well constructed turn as Selby, Aileen's love.  She can't really hold her own against Theron mostly because Charlize is so absorbing, but her final scenes are devastating and raw; just what this film needed.  A group of actors that I think should be singled out are those who portrayed the men who lost their lives to Aileen, especially Marco St. John and Scott Wilson.`Monster' is not a flawless film but it is a solid three star film that deserves to be seen.  Charlize Theron's performance though is so flawless, so undeniably remarkable that she elevates this film to four stars, demanding that we give it a chance.  This is not an easy film to watch for it ravages the audience with brutality so repulsive yet so heartbreaking that our emotions are jumbled and confused.  Do we feel sympathies for this woman or do we feel anger towards her actions?  One thing is for certain, because of `Monster' everyone will know and remember Aileen Wuornos.",4,Truly devastating depiction of a woman at the end of her rope...,1204502400,"03 3,

This movies is not flowers and lace. It's more comparable to scum and mildew, but that is exactly what sets the film apart from the rest.Charlize Theron's tranformation from the beautiful South African woman that she is, to a homely, non-descript woman is truly amazing. Her portrayl is so convincing of Aileen, that you hardly remember that it's Ms. Theron at all. Her usual sensuous voice takes on a tone of a decandant prostitue, with a butch overtone. Christina Ricci is also not to shabby in her role.Even though the character of Aileen is such a horrendous person, Charlize Theron manages to pull at your heart strings. By the end of the film, you are filled with such sympathy for her character, that the murderous crimes that she has commited seem to not matter much anymore. You come to realize that even a person like her can have so much love for someone, that forgivness isn't forced, but utterly natural.The movie has a tone of ugliness and darkness throughout.

How will we be aware of these people? how will we know that we should notice them and try to change them and help these people?I won't give you a summary of the story, since so many people did. I just like to point out the explosive performance of Theron- how could you even imagine a model-like beauty could pull off a psychopath? The make-up certainly helped, but of course, all props to Theron, she definitely needed the Oscar, which she rightfully won.The movie revealed that it's not true all serial killers are cold-blood murderers, as many of us like to believe, but the result of negative drives. I'm not justifying for Aileen's actions, they were definitely wrong, but she definitely needed help. If she didn't have an abusive childhood or had recieved professional help, she probably would never have ended up this way. I think it's completely true that while Aileen's action is her own, maybe we all share a part of the responsiblity; while she's wrong in killing people, the people who drove her mentally mad to do it also did a very wrong thing.Monster truly is a masterpiece.

622410,A38N4MOCLSOKOH,B00005JMUK,Armando A. Gomez,"[1, 1]","November 10, 2010This review is in the defense of Christina Ricci's role as Selby Wall. Ricci was a surprising element as Selby Wall, Aileen Wuornos's unexpected love interest. Though Charlize Theron is well deserving of the accolades for her performance as Aileen Wuornos, Ricci's role was the prime ingredient in Theron's great accomplishment. The majority of ""professional"" critics (outside Amazon.com) down grade Ricci's acting ability. If she had any shortcomings-and they aren't any-it's misleading, to say the least, and such criticism should fall directly to the Director/Writer, Patty Jenkins. Ms Jenkins, as director, has the last word when she said ""cut!"" In my book, the director gets the credit as well as the blame.Some of the criticisms were also directed toward the movie's writing, notably, the dialogue. In this I'm forced to agree. It is at this point that bad dialogue colored Ricci's acting ability in a negative light.For example, during a conversation between Selby and Aileen at the skating ring's commissary, the dialogue between the women was confusing, bordering on idiotic. There was no logic or reason for Selby to assume that Aileen was a prostitute and to consider her as a highly paid and highly in demand prostitute at that. You have to be a complete moron to assume this is so: Aileen's appearance was that of a down-and-out vagrant with a face only a mother could love, maybe.It was at this point the critics considered Selby duplicitous and conniving, coloring her personality throughout the movie. Selby's intention to reach out to Aileen was sincere and genuine. Any dialogue or writing to suggest otherwise seriously conflict the very tenet of the two actresses' performances, this included Selby's finger pointing at Aileen's murder trial, where she was forced to single her out. I don't have any objection that Selby identified her for the prosecution, but I do object when it was delivered without emotion; in spite of Selby's shortcomings, she was truly in love with Aileen, hence, unable to be so cold-blooded.It was the disintegration of Aileen's mind, that into a serial killer, along with Selby's fear of being associated with the murders, which crush their relationship. Selby's emotional state at the end of the movie should have been more shattering, but this was not the case; forced betrayal of the heart should have totally devastated her, leaving Selby inconsolable. This, too, was not the case, convicting Selby as treacherous while comprising the movie's climax.On the other hand, the Ricci's character enhanced the movie: Selby is a lesbian while Aileen was not. Despite the facts, such a romance couldn't have bloomed, but Christian Ricci's acting skills made it happen, along with Theron's, of course. To her credit, Ricci's lesbian appearance, more feminine than the average lesbian, made the movie more salable.Though the movie is a cinematic ground breaker, it still used the time-honored Hollywood tack: beauty and the beast. Even in a scene in which Ricci, with the extra ten pounds added to her frame, strutted across a living room with the conviction of a truck driver. With only a tank t-shirt and a pair of Dickie work pants, she was able to execute that audacious swagger with fluent femininity; a testament to her acting ability.The mixture of comeliness and homeliness, the exquisiteness of Christina Ricci and the appalling apparition of Charlize Theron, brought moviegoers in droves into the theaters. Despite the horrific acts in the movie (as in Boy's Don't Cry), the movie is interlaced with tenderness and poignancy, thus making the film worth watching. Note: despite what I just wrote on the previous sentence, this film is rated R and for good reason; there's a horric scene of violence against Theron's character, brutal and ugly.ATTENTIONNovember 15, 2010In the Special Edition of ""Monster,"" which I just received, I went through the film's commentary by Charlize Theron (producer, actress) and Patty Jenkins (director). The commentary by both Theron and Jenkins proved to be riveting, enthralling and crushing. The conclusion of the film was ever more shattering, more crushing with Theron's and Jenkins' final comments. But I do have one important comment which the film commentary, Charlize Theron and Patty Jenkins failed to acknowledge: Where the hell was Christina Ricci??? She was not part of the film's commentary entourage. This is a serious breach of consistency. Regardless how well the commentary concluded by Theron and Jenkins, it leaves a massive blackhole in the film's commentary. Why wasn't Ricci included? Was she on another project at the time? Did Ricci refuse to participate? Or worse, was she KEPT OFF from the commentary??? If these questions are left unanswered, then the Film Commentary is left incomplete and suspect. This is a very serious thread to be left dangling.PS: Personally, I won't accept that ""Ricci was on another project"" which prevented her from adding her two cents in the commentary.",4,In the

622411,A1184B1I5G87YF,B00005JMUK,"Austin ""atticus101""","[2, 2]","Sometimes there comes a film that just makes you want to go take a shower because you need to after watching it.  No, not those types of movies, I'm talking about those movies that suck you in and make you feel like your part of the movie from beginning to end and don't let go till the credits role. I felt this way after seeing Charlize Theron's performance in Monster, a well acted, well crafted film from Patty Jenkins.For those of you who didn't follow the story during Oscar time a few years ago, the performance and transformation of Ms. Theron is amazing and a earns over her Best Actress Academy Award several times over.  The movie follows the criminal rise of serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute in Daytona Beach, FL.  After a life full of curve balls, we first met Aileen under an overpass waiting to kill herself with a rusty old revolver, the only thing that stops her is her thoughts to spend the money she made on a John a few hours before hand.  At a local gay bar, she meets Selby (Christina Ricci) a local lesbian girl living in Florida with family friends.  Selby's life isn't great either, she can't work due to a broken arm, she is trying to escape her father and a life of dullness in Ohio and her boarders at the home don't approve of her lifestyle.  After a night of heavy drinking, Selby and Aileen become fast friends on a track to become lovers.  Aileen convinces Selby to move out and live with her on the streets.  Selby hesitantly agrees to this venture and we begin a journey with Selby and Aileen.  Selby soon learns that Aileen has killed a man for brutally rapping her and stole his money, but Aileen is apologetic and tells Selby it was in self defense and that it would never happen again.Aileen begins to try and make her life turn for the better, she applies for jobs all over the Daytona Beach region and is turned down, cruelly is some cases, and this only fuels her rage.  Aileen decided to go back to hooking on the streets and highways but decides to kill the Johns before the sex act and takes their money and cars.  Eventually, this begins to catch up to Aileen and Selby as they start to run all over the state, trying to avoid the law.  Aileen is eventually caught and sentenced to be executed by the state of Florida.To find a fault with this film would be hard.  If any, I would have to say that Selby could have been fleshed out a little more but her character is not lacking in development but pales in comparison to Aileen in back story and motivation.  The work of director Patty Jenkins (who also wrote the script) is well done, crafting a tale of murders that allows room for motive and reasoning behind the ones we see on screen.  Ms. Theron and Ms. Ricci are both excellent in playing their characters; especially the emotion between the two and the acceptance to what Aileen becomes towards the end of the film is noticeable.Ms. Theron's performance is the highlight of the film.  Not only her physical transformation but also her emotions on screen make you cringe after each murder we watch her commit.  As the writer, Ms. Jenkins does an excellent job letting us into Aileen's head and explaining motivations to us.  Aileen begins to rationalize her actions after each killing, talking to herself in a fast and worried voice and as the killings and her confidence progress; she begins to tell her victims why she is doing what she does before she kills them.  As a whole, Ms. Theron's performance should rank among the all time greats.The other actors in this film excel when ever they are on screen and there isn't a down performance among them.  Bruce Dern's role as Aileen's male friend/confidante is good and would probably be great if he had more screen time.  The strong supporting role of Christina Ricci is a sight to see playing the mousy and shy Selby who gains confidence and feeds off Aileen's own bravado increases, only to collapse once again once Aileen succumbs to the manhunt for her and gives up.Watching this movie makes you wonder exactly how the victim's families feel.  Most of the men we see killed on screen were married and had families.  Yet they were killed brutally in the act of soliciting sex from a prostitute and left for dead, even some of these men in the film make lewd request to Aileen before she is about to render her services.  You have to wonder if these scenes were those made by Ms. Jenkins in the writing process or taken form transcripts of Aileen Wuornos to the police and how they reacted seeing these scenes on film.All in all, this movie can be summed up this way: Great for a viewer who enjoys a movie with strong performances and strong dialogue, though the movie is violent and does not blink when looking into the life that Aileen has lead.",5,Great movie with strong acting and writing,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,4762,"['Sometimes', 'film', 'just', 'want', 'go', 'take', 'shower', 'need', 'watching', 'No', 'not', 'types', 'movies', ""'m"", 'talking', 'movies', 'suck', 'make', 'feel', 'part', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'till', 'credits', 'role', 'felt', 'way', 'seeing', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'performance', 'Monster', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', 'Patty', 'Jenkins.For', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'story', 'Oscar', 'time', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'performance', 'transformation', 'Ms.', 'Theron', 'amazing', 'earns', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Award', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'criminal', 'rise', 'serial', 'killer', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'prostitute', 'Daytona', 'Beach', 'FL', 'life', 'full', 'curve', 'balls', 'first', 'met', 'Aileen', 'overpass', 'waiting', 'kill', 'rusty', 'old', 'revolver', 'only', 'thing', 'thoughts', 'spend', 'money', 'made', 'John', 'few', 'hours', 'hand', 'local', 'gay', 'bar', 'Selby', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'local', 'lesbian', 'girl', 'living', 'Florida', 'family', 'friends', 'Selby', 'life', ""n't"", 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'due', 'broken', 'arm', 'trying', 'escape', 'father', 'life', 'dullness', 'Ohio', 'boarders', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'approve', 'lifestyle', 'night', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'Selby', 'Aileen', 'become', 'fast', 'friends', 'track', 'become', 'lovers', 'Aileen', 'Selby', 'move', 'out', 'live', 'streets', 'Selby', 'hesitantly', 'venture', 'begin', 'journey', 'Selby', 'Aileen', 'Selby', 'soon', 'Aileen', 'killed', 'man', 'brutally', 'rapping', 'stole', 'money', 'Aileen', 'apologetic', 'Selby', 'was', 'self', 'defense', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'again.Aileen', 'try', 'make', 'life', 'turn', 'better', 'jobs', 'Daytona', 'Beach', 'region', 'turned', 'down', 'cruelly', 'cases', 'only', 'rage', 'Aileen', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'hooking', 'streets', 'highways', 'kill', 'Johns', 'sex', 'act', 'money', 'cars', 'Eventually', 'catch', 'up', 'Aileen', 'Selby', 'start', 'run', 'state', 'trying', 'avoid', 'law', 'Aileen', 'eventually', 'caught', 'sentenced', 'be', 'executed', 'state', 'Florida.To', 'find', 'fault', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'Selby', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'character', 'not', 'lacking', 'development', 'pales', 'comparison', 'Aileen', 'back', 'story', 'motivation', 'work', 'director', 'Patty', 'Jenkins', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'well', 'done', 'crafting', 'tale', 'murders', 'room', 'motive', 'reasoning', 'ones', 'see', 'screen', 'Ms.', 'Theron', 'Ms.', 'Ricci', 'are', 'excellent', 'playing', 'characters', 'especially', 'emotion', 'two', 'acceptance', 'what', 'Aileen', 'end', 'film', 'noticeable.Ms', 'Theron', 'performance', 'highlight', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'physical', 'transformation', 'also', 'emotions', 'screen', 'make', 'cringe', 'murder', 'watch', 'commit', 'writer', 'Ms.', 'Jenkins', 'excellent', 'job', 'letting', 'Aileen', 'head', 'explaining', 'motivations', 'Aileen', 'rationalize', 'actions', 'killing', 'talking', 'herself', 'fast', 'worried', 'voice', 'killings', 'confidence', 'progress', 'tell', 'victims', 'why', 'doing', 'what', 'whole', 'Ms.', 'Theron', 'performance', 'should', 'rank', 'time', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'excel', 'when', 'ever', 'are', 'screen', ""n't"", 'down', 'performance', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'role', 'Aileen', 'male', 'friend/confidante', 'good', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'great', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'strong', 'supporting', 'role', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'sight', 'see', 'playing', 'mousy', 'shy', 'Selby', 'who', 'gains', 'confidence', 'feeds', 'off', 'Aileen', 'own', 'bravado', 'increases', 'only', 'collapse', 'once', 'again', 'once', 'Aileen', 'succumbs', 'manhunt', 'up.Watching', 'movie', 'wonder', 'exactly', 'how', 'victim', 'families', 'feel', 'Most', 'men', 'see', 'killed', 'screen', 'were', 'married', 'had', 'families', 'were', 'killed', 'brutally', 'act', 'soliciting', 'sex', 'prostitute', 'left', 'dead', 'even', 'men', 'film', 'make', 'lewd', 'request', 'Aileen', 'render', 'services', 'have', 'wonder', 'scenes', 'were', 'made', 'Ms.', 'Jenkins', 'writing', 'process', 'taken', 'form', 'transcripts', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'police', 'how', 'reacted', 'seeing', 'scenes', 'film.All', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'way', 'Great', 'viewer', 'who', 'movie', 'strong', 'performances', 'strong', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'violent', 'not', 'blink', 'when', 'looking', 'life', 'Aileen', 'lead']",Monster

622413,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00005JMUK,Benjamin,"[5, 8]","There is an indistinct moment during MONSTER when Charlize Theron does disappear into the role of serial killer Aileen Wuornos. You stop looking at Charlize Theron and thinking of how she transformed herself so completely. You stop watching the mannerisms she's given her character and the way she has her talk. You stop spending the film separating the actor and the role, and you just become engrossed in the film and in the flawed reasoning and psychology of a disturbed, sad killer.When that happens, MONSTER begins to work really well.Well-acted by Theron and Christina Ricci in the vein of MONSTER'S BALL and BOYS DON'T CRY, it's not a perfect film, but it's certainly a provocative one. You begin to actually sympathize with Wuornos and her history of abuse. Though her acts are irredeemable, several audience members did weep for her at the screening I attended. Discussions afterward were plentiful, asking questions about how much Wuornos was a creature of her environment and how much she was just a killer. It's a tremendous accomplishment that MONSTER generated that kind of response.The screenplay does pull some punches, though. Some of Aileen's earlier actions and statements are too contrived. The film makes one of Aileen's more sympathetic johns a stutterer so that the audience will immediately feel for him. At one point, to demonize a supporting character, the screenplay has her utter an out-of-place obscenity which leads the audience to immediately hate her.On the whole, though, MONSTER is a very good film with a great performance carrying it.",5,"Charlize Theron, as you've heard, is amazing.",1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,1570,"['indistinct', 'moment', 'MONSTER', 'when', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'disappear', 'role', 'serial', 'killer', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'stop', 'looking', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'thinking', 'how', 'transformed', 'so', 'completely', 'stop', 'watching', 'mannerisms', 'given', 'character', 'way', 'talk', 'stop', 'spending', 'film', 'separating', 'actor', 'role', 'just', 'become', 'engrossed', 'film', 'flawed', 'reasoning', 'psychology', 'disturbed', 'sad', 'killer.When', 'MONSTER', 'work', 'really', 'well.Well-acted', 'Theron', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'vein', 'MONSTER', 'BALL', 'BOYS', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'CRY', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'certainly', 'provocative', 'one', 'begin', 'actually', 'sympathize', 'Wuornos', 'history', 'abuse', 'acts', 'are', 'irredeemable', 'several', 'audience', 'members', 'did', 'weep', 'screening', 'attended', 'Discussions', 'afterward', 'were', 'plentiful', 'asking', 'questions', 'how', 'much', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'creature', 'environment', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'just', 'killer', 'tremendous', 'accomplishment', 'MONSTER', 'generated', 'kind', 'response.The', 'screenplay', 'pull', 'punches', 'though', 'Aileen', 'earlier', 'actions', 'statements', 'are', 'too', 'contrived', 'film', 'one', 'Aileen', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'johns', 'stutterer', 'so', 'audience', 'will', 'immediately', 'feel', 'one', 'point', 'demonize', 'supporting', 'character', 'screenplay', 'utter', 'out-of-place', 'obscenity', 'audience', 'immediately', 'hate', 'her.On', 'whole', 'though', 'MONSTER', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'great', 'performance', 'carrying']",Monster
622414,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B00005JMUK,Ben Rowland,"[5, 9]","""Monster"" is easily one of the most gripping movies to come along in years, owing to both the potent subject matter and the stellar performances by the two female leads. It is a sad, brutal story about the unfortunate lives of two women who find solace in each other, and their struggle for survival leads to a murder spree that produced America's first female serial killer.Based on the true account of Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron), her sad story will grip you from the beginning. She was a prostitute from the age of 13, and has led the hardest of lives. She has never known love, affection, and has lived on a wing and a prayer. The real life Wuornos claimed to have slept with over 250,000 men in her lifetime. One night, she meets a young kindred spirit named Selby (Christina Ricci). She lives under slightly better circumstances, but still feels detached from the rest of society, being a lesbian in a strictly religious family. What blossoms is a love story between these two girls. Wuornos is not a lesbian per-se, but she is smitten with Selby, who is the first person to love her for who she really is, and not treat her like trash and cast her aside. One fateful encounter with a vicious john and potential killer turns the tide. Wuornos kills a john who has beat and raped her, and if given the chance, would have killed her. This starts her down a pit with greasy sides, and she takes to the streets and kills as many johns who will pick her up. Her motives are both money and survival, for her and Selby, who is nave and squeamish but willing to play along. Her initial killing was justifiable, and the audience will empathize with her for it, but the murders that ensue become more and more senseless.""Monster"" is not a morality tale, nor does it condone or condemn the crimes Wuornos commits. It tells the story of one life that started in the gutter and never quite crawled out. Wuornos is a character who is both physically and personally unattractive, drunk and mouthy throughout most of the movie, but you cannot help but feel sadness for her, though you don't forgive her for the crimes she commits. The Selby character is the Yin to the Yang in this case. She is much younger than Wuornos, and while open about her homosexuality, she is still confused and somewhat disillusioned about the world around her. She is in it for the love and security, while Wuornos is surprised that she can love at all after the life she's lived.There has been much buzz about Charlize Theron's powerhouse performance, so much that it has overshadowed every other aspect of the movie. The hype, however, is very much deserved. Theron doesn't just play the part, she becomes it. She plays with honesty and conviction that we rarely see in performances nowadays. Even more shocking is how she has transformed for the role. The makeup effects aside (which add 10 years to her life), she gained 30 pounds for the role, and her physical appearances suggest countless rapes, beatings, and the ravages of hard living and consumption. The transformation has to be seen to be believed. Christina Ricci has only gotten better with age, and while this role is more subdued than her best (The Opposite of Sex leaps to mind), she is fantastic as always.What I respect most about ""Monster"" is that it is not overly dramatic in trying to humanize some pretty nasty characters, nor does it pander to the typical Hollywood clich&eacute;s. Having said that, it is also doesn't pull any punches. The violence and rape scenes will leave scars on more sensitive viewers, but even the most dismissive viewers cannot deny the impact of this movie, and the performance of Theron will stand as one of the best female lead roles in recent years.",5,"The best movie, and best performance, of 2003.",1076716800,"02 14, 2004",2004,3726,"['Monster', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'gripping', 'movies', 'come', 'along', 'years', 'owing', 'potent', 'subject', 'matter', 'stellar', 'performances', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'sad', 'brutal', 'story', 'unfortunate', 'lives', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'find', 'solace', 'other', 'struggle', 'survival', 'leads', 'murder', 'spree', 'produced', 'America', 'first', 'female', 'serial', 'killer.Based', 'true', 'account', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'sad', 'story', 'will', 'grip', 'beginning', 'was', 'prostitute', 'age', '13', 'led', 'hardest', 'lives', 'never', 'known', 'love', 'affection', 'lived', 'wing', 'prayer', 'real', 'life', 'Wuornos', 'claimed', 'have', 'slept', '250,000', 'men', 'lifetime', 'One', 'night', 'young', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'named', 'Selby', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'slightly', 'better', 'circumstances', 'still', 'feels', 'detached', 'rest', 'society', 'being', 'lesbian', 'strictly', 'religious', 'family', 'What', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'girls', 'Wuornos', 'not', 'lesbian', 'per-se', 'smitten', 'Selby', 'who', 'first', 'person', 'love', 'who', 'really', 'not', 'treat', 'trash', 'cast', 'aside', 'One', 'fateful', 'encounter', 'vicious', 'john', 'potential', 'killer', 'tide', 'Wuornos', 'john', 'who', 'beat', 'raped', 'given', 'chance', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'down', 'pit', 'greasy', 'sides', 'streets', 'kills', 'many', 'johns', 'who', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'motives', 'are', 'money', 'survival', 'Selby', 'who', 'nave', 'squeamish', 'willing', 'play', 'along', 'initial', 'killing', 'was', 'justifiable', 'audience', 'will', 'empathize', 'murders', 'ensue', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'senseless', 'Monster', 'not', 'morality', 'tale', 'condone', 'condemn', 'crimes', 'Wuornos', 'commits', 'story', 'one', 'life', 'started', 'gutter', 'never', 'quite', 'crawled', 'out', 'Wuornos', 'character', 'who', 'physically', 'personally', 'unattractive', 'drunk', 'mouthy', 'most', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'sadness', 'do', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'crimes', 'Selby', 'character', 'Yin', 'Yang', 'case', 'much', 'younger', 'Wuornos', 'open', 'homosexuality', 'still', 'confused', 'somewhat', 'disillusioned', 'world', 'love', 'security', 'Wuornos', 'surprised', 'can', 'love', 'life', 'lived.There', 'been', 'much', 'buzz', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'so', 'much', 'overshadowed', 'other', 'aspect', 'movie', 'hype', 'however', 'very', 'much', 'deserved', 'Theron', ""n't"", 'just', 'play', 'part', 'honesty', 'conviction', 'rarely', 'see', 'performances', 'nowadays', 'Even', 'more', 'shocking', 'how', 'transformed', 'role', 'makeup', 'effects', 'aside', 'add', '10', 'years', 'life', 'gained', '30', 'pounds', 'role', 'physical', 'appearances', 'suggest', 'countless', 'rapes', 'beatings', 'ravages', 'hard', 'living', 'consumption', 'transformation', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'only', 'gotten', 'better', 'age', 'role', 'more', 'subdued', 'best', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'leaps', 'mind', 'fantastic', 'respect', 'most', 'Monster', 'not', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'trying', 'humanize', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'characters', 'pander', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Having', 'said', 'also', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'violence', 'rape', 'scenes', 'will', 'leave', 'scars', 'more', 'sensitive', 'viewers', 'even', 'most', 'dismissive', 'viewers', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'impact', 'movie', 'performance', 'Theron', 'will', 'stand', 'one', 'best', 'female', 'lead', 'roles', 'recent', 'years']",Monster

I'm not quite ready to say ""50 years,"" but if you limit yourself to films of 2003, I'd say no one comes close to Charlize Theron's performance as true-life serial killer & hooker Ailine Wuornos.It takes about half an hour for Theron to find her groove.  At first, she is all ticks and shoulder twitches to emphasize Wuornos' awkwardness and inability to deal with other people.  Then she suddenly disappears into her character, and the audience stops thinking about how much weight the actress has gained, or how much make-up she must be wearing, and really starts believing the story.The director has also done an outstanding job; there is something disturbing and desolate about the way she films the Florida landscape the Wuornos stalked.  You see Florida the way Aline Wuornos did:  hopeless, hellish, irredeemable.I thought Christina Ricci was just fine as Wuornos' lover, Selby, but the best secondary performance in the film is a small one by the almost-unrecognizable Bruce Dern as Wuornos' one real friend.

The only reality she's ever known is that of abuse, violence, exploitation, rape, and utter betrayal. She is the product of years of hammering on the soul-destroying anvil of street-life and selling her body for money. Moments away from commiting suicide, Aileen meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) in a bar and sparks fly, leading this hopeless woman to believe she might actually find happiness. Aileen attempts to run off with Selby and save her from her hyper-religious family. She hits the streets in order to make enough money for them to get away, only to be viciously attacked by a sadistic john, who is bent on torturing and killing her. Aileen shoots him to death in self-defense, which hurls her into a downward plunge that she'll never be able to escape. She becomes an avenging angel of death, executing johns and stealing their cash and cars.  Selby watches as Aileen falls deeper and more unreachably into darkness. However, this is not the typical Bundy / Dahlmer / Gacey serial-killer tale. Aileen Wournos is a sympathetic / empathetic character who kills not only out of rage and vengeance, but out of a sorrow so deep it has become lethal and uncontrollable. Based on the true story, MONSTER is the all-too-human tale of a desperate woman's last gasps before dying. It's not pretty, but it is totally genuine and believable.

Yes, Theron's performance is engaging and it is worth watching for this reason.However it is not the movie that I had hoped to have seen. I found myself feeling sympathy for the character of Wournos and I didn't want to.  Yes she had a disgraceful childhood, yes she was beaten up by several men (one in a very brutal way), yes her future looked grim but there are thousands of women all throughout America whom are living this life. It is not an excuse for murder.Having read quite a bit on the Wournos case I would rather have seen a movie about a woman who was kicked at her lowest time and time again and made the wrong choice and went down the pathway of destruction. Wournos supposedly said to many of her friends throughout her adult life that she would be famous in one way or another. She was even quoted as saying that she was going to be like a female Jesse James and be idolised and adored by woman the world over for being an outlaw and getting rid of men. I also think that in the film Ricci's character is the one controlling all the shots. However from what I have read Wournos was also very domineering and controlling and whilst she may have been more desperate and needy of the relationship she also was said to have had the upper hand on her real life lover.You never quite get this feeling in the movie.Ricci, whom I usually enjoy on the screen is nothing short of painful.

why couldn't selby go out & get a job to help pay the bills? knowing full well that aileen didn't want to prostitute her body any longer, could selby have not tried to help out somehow? throughout the course of the film, we learn how truly disturbed aileen really is & how this stems from repeated abuse over time which never truly ceases. at one point in the film, ms. wuornos(played by theron) tells a man held at gunpoint of how she was molested as a child by a friend of the family & physically abused as well by her own father for simply conveying the truth. she also reveals to us us that she has been on the streets since the age of 13 selling her body to men who we can assume were just as abusive. what i find most touching about monster is how ms. wuonrnos tried so many times to go out into society & earn a decent living but failed like so many do because of the way society is so quick to judge or reject a human for simply trying to better themselves. monster is not an easy film to digest by any means & packs quite a wallop but is definately a must see film. patty jenkins allows us to feel sympathy for the woman who so many people would've considered to be a monster & is asking us to rethink everything we've learned about this tortured soul. charlize theron may have had some decent roles in the past but probability suggests that nothing she has done in the past or will do in the future will hold a candle to her performance here. charlize theron is  remarkable here in nearly every sense of the word. although i've never truly agreed with the academy decisions, theron rightfully deserved the oscar she recieved last month.",5,charlize theron raises the bar with this role,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,2663,"['should', 'come', 'real', 'shock', 'true', 'movie', 'lover', 'theron', 'won', 'best', 'actress', 'academy', 'award', 'year', 'not', 'mention', 'thr', 'awards', 'won', 'prior', 'such', 'golden', 'globe', 'award', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'performances', 'times', 'charlize', 'theron', 'shocking', 'yet', 'humanized', 'portrait', 'aileen', 'wuornos', 'completely', 'unforgettable', 'aileen', 'wuornos', 'will', 'remind', 'many', 'ways', 'ourselves', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'how', 'often', 'cry', 'out', 'help', 'one', 'truly', 'unfortunately', 'most', 'wait', 'most', 'lives', 'special', 'moment', 'person', 'reason', 'enough', 'reconcile', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'done', 'even', 'consider', 'living', 'selby', 'was', 'aileen', 'reason', 'living', 'comtemplated', 'suicide', 'ultimate', 'hope', 'having', 'better', 'life', 'obviously', 'aileen', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'considered', 'relationship', 'woman', 'i', 'believe', 'strongly', 'felt', 'was', 'worth', 'try', 'living', 'life', 'emptiness', 'constant', 'heartache', 'question', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'selby', 'go', 'out', 'get', 'job', 'help', 'pay', 'bills', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'aileen', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'prostitute', 'body', 'longer', 'could', 'selby', 'have', 'not', 'tried', 'help', 'out', 'somehow', 'course', 'film', 'learn', 'how', 'truly', 'disturbed', 'aileen', 'really', 'how', 'repeated', 'abuse', 'time', 'never', 'truly', 'ceases', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'ms.', 'wuornos', 'played', 'theron', 'man', 'held', 'gunpoint', 'how', 'was', 'molested', 'child', 'friend', 'family', 'physically', 'abused', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'father', 'simply', 'conveying', 'truth', 'also', 'been', 'streets', 'age', '13', 'selling', 'body', 'men', 'who', 'can', 'assume', 'were', 'just', 'abusive', 'what', 'i', 'find', 'most', 'touching', 'monster', 'how', 'ms.', 'wuonrnos', 'tried', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'go', 'out', 'society', 'earn', 'decent', 'living', 'failed', 'so', 'many', 'do', 'way', 'society', 'so', 'quick', 'judge', 'reject', 'human', 'simply', 'trying', 'better', 'monster', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'digest', 'means', 'packs', 'quite', 'wallop', 'definately', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'patty', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'would', ""'ve"", 'considered', 'be', 'monster', 'asking', 'rethink', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'tortured', 'soul', 'charlize', 'theron', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'decent', 'roles', 'past', 'probability', 'nothing', 'done', 'past', 'will', 'do', 'future', 'will', 'hold', 'candle', 'performance', 'here', 'charlize', 'theron', 'remarkable', 'here', 'nearly', 'sense', 'word', 'i', ""'ve"", 'never', 'truly', 'agreed', 'academy', 'decisions', 'rightfully', 'deserved', 'oscar', 'recieved', 'last', 'month']",Monster

When I say help I mean therapy and medication. She went through a horrible amount of pain in her life, and instead of rising above it she let it eat her up and destroy her life. In my opinion this movie somewhat glorifies that. I don't think a film should glorify weakness of that kind. A lot of people have been through horrible, unbelievable things in their lives and don't turn out to be serial killers.All this movie does is make excuses for the things that she did. Yeah, okay, we are supposed to feel sorry for her and this is supposed to make is realize that even serial killers are people too... blah blah blah. I'm not buying it. If I killed every man who raped or tried to rape me (yeah I'm not ashamed to admit it) I'd be in jail too, and I'd have had more victims than Wuoros. Instead I took a different kind of action because I knew it was the right thing to do. Wuornos knew the difference between right and wrong the same as anybody else does. Sorry, but she did. There is no excuse for violence ever. Period.Wuornos could have gone to a battered woman's shelter or a rape crisis center for help. She could have told police that she first man was killed in self defense and then stopped killing after that. But instead she didn't. She thought she only had one way, which was wrong. There is always a way out, and violence is never the correct path to choose. Why glorify her misdeeds? After reading A LOT about Wuornos I feel that they could have shown what they needed to show to get the point across, but there was no need for showing graphic violence and rape scenes. Why show that except to sensationalize the film and distract from the true message of the story?The movie was well made and acted brilliantly, which is why I give it two stars. There is no flaw in the acting whatsoever.I wish that the film had shown more of the aftermath of Wuornos' imprisonment and death, because during her imprisonment she became a Christian and was legally adopted by a woman who (according to what I've read) was basically using her for money. Also it seems that if she'd had a better lawyer she might not have gotten the death penalty. I think that should have been part of the movie, but the movie basically just focused on her killing and how she ended up in jail in the first place.Also in the special features the director and a lot of other people seem super pompous and act like this movie can cure cancer or something.

I beg to differ. Charlize Theron, in her outstanding job of acting, magnificently brings out the suffering, the loneliness, the despair of this unfortunate individual. Aileen comes from a dreary background (her mother abandons her, her father commits suicide, and she turns to prostitution in her early teens). The movie opens with Aileen contemplating suicide. Then she meets her future lover, Selby, in a bar, and becomes intoxicated with the type of friendship that has been denied her all of her life. She becomes alive, wanting nothing else but to hold on to her new lover, and make her happy.She engages in a frenzied bout of hooking in order to get some cash to sustain her in this new relationship. A tragedy ensues in which Aileen kills a psychopathic john. Aileen continues to kill, mostly for the cash, and to have a car to get around in. In her desire to leave the life of a pro she tries to get a job to support herself and Selby. She doesn't have a clue about how to dress properly or interview for a job. The experience is frustrating and painful to her, and she sees, as do we, what a true outcast she is. She puts on a sour grapes bravado with Selby: who wants their stupid jobs anyway.This carefully scripted movie leads the viewer to an understanding of Aileen, but does not promote sympathy for her. Her murders are too repellent for sympathy. Ms Theron is excellent in showing the frantic hopelessness of Aileen, who struggles desperately to hold her life together. She wants to live with Selby, have a job, and a house in the suburbs, but knows deep down under the macho front she tries to maintain, that her dreams will never be realized.See inside Aileen? We see inside her with every wild wide eyed look; with every gesture; with every word she utters. Her anger, her walk, her desperation all show us a person who is totally outside society. There is no way she will ever fit in. We know it and she knows it.

When I saw the first killing, which in the movie, is spurred by a very violent rape, I thought that perhaps Ms. Wuoronos was executed wrongly.  However, it appears that she recanted the rape claim altogether (victim's real name was Richard Mallory).  That kinda ticks me off, because that is a key scene that made me feel sympathetic for this pathetic woman.  NOW I read that she recanted that story altogether!  With that in mind, this now comes off as a man-hating diatribe that you can watch with your girlfriends who have been wronged by men.In any event, even if this major fact is wrong in the film, this really IS an amazing film.  Charlize, as you've heard, does a fantastic job of pulling off the trailer-trash personality of Ms. Wuoronos.  Christina Ricci does a great job, but I read that Aileen's friend in real life was 28, while the film made Ricci's character seem like 17 or 18 years old.So, although I was glued to the TV, I am a little disappointed at the major factual flaws that I have unearthed since watching it.",4,Don't feel TOO bad for Aileen....,1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,1115,"['just', 'did', 'little', 'research', 'Ms.', 'Wuoronos', 'being', 'amazed', 'film', 'When', 'saw', 'first', 'killing', 'movie', 'spurred', 'very', 'violent', 'rape', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'Ms.', 'Wuoronos', 'was', 'executed', 'wrongly', 'However', 'recanted', 'rape', 'claim', 'altogether', 'victim', 'real', 'name', 'was', 'Richard', 'Mallory', 'kinda', 'off', 'key', 'scene', 'made', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'pathetic', 'woman', 'NOW', 'read', 'recanted', 'story', 'altogether', 'mind', 'now', 'off', 'man-hating', 'diatribe', 'can', 'watch', 'girlfriends', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'wronged', 'men.In', 'event', 'even', 'major', 'fact', 'wrong', 'film', 'really', 'amazing', 'film', 'Charlize', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'fantastic', 'job', 'pulling', 'off', 'trailer-trash', 'personality', 'Ms.', 'Wuoronos', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'great', 'job', 'read', 'Aileen', 'friend', 'real', 'life', 'was', '28', 'film', 'made', 'Ricci', 'character', 'seem', '17', '18', 'years', 'old.So', 'was', 'glued', 'TV', 'am', 'little', 'disappointed', 'major', 'factual', 'flaws', 'have', 'unearthed', 'watching']",Monster

A tragic and sad story of a woman beaten down by the horrible turn of events that happen in her life (especially in her childhood). Aileen Wournos, who was called the first woman serial killer who was executed thru lethal injection on October 9, 2002 in Florida had life messed up and confused from the time that she was 13, when she became pregnant and forced I believe to live out on her own.Along the way she encountered everything that was bad and found early on that the only way to survive was to prostitue herself for money. One day she walks into a seedy bar and meets Selby a young lesbian girl who is somewhat confused with her sexuality (not completely out of the closet) they take a liking to each other and soon enough become lovers. Aileen who was fed up with the way her life was going wanted no longer to continue hooking but had her johns believe that she was and ended up killing seven men while stealing their wallets and their cars.Men represented everything that had gone wrong with her life and so she rebelled against them and loathed them with a passion. Therefore she had no remorse about killing them one by one since they were all dogs to begin with. Charlize Theron who gave an amazing Oscar winning performance paints a harrowing and chilling portrayal of the confused and desperate Wournos trying to keep herself in the clear and from getting caught from the police. This movie is very intense and I think its director Patty Jenkins who also wrote the script did an excellent job helming this film. Christina Ricci who plays Selby her lover and is also on the run with her does a very good job as well, however if for what is worth what makes people want to see this movie is without a doubt Theron's brilliant performance. Her transformation physical and emotional was unbeliveable. Charlize Theron who is I believe one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood pull all the stops in making her character look identical to the real Aileen Wournos. Theron gained 30 pounds, colored her hair to dirty blond had her face practically redone with a lot of freckles and even had prosthetics done on her teeth. I strongly believe that both Christina Ricci and writer/director Patty Jenkins should of both won oscars for their great work.

622431,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00005JMUK,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","If you have not seen Charlize Theron 'channel' Aileen Wuornos in the film Monster, you are in for an amazing film experience. This performance by Theron will become legendary, much like Robert DeNero's legendary acting in Raging Bull. Let me explain why I found this film to be exceptional: When I read a book or see a film, I watch for the manner in which the writer,director, and actors portray the characters.  The more justice shown and compassion shown, generally the more I like the work. I am not  convinced of pure evil or pure charity or pure innocenence or pure revenge. Charlize Theron allows us to see the terribly twisted youth and adolescence of Aileen, the series of bad breaks and miscalculations, and yet we also see her crimes as unnecessary, especially all her murders after the first murder. She did kill a sadistic rapist in self defense in her first homocide, but unfortunately this melts into a series of murders. It is when a good Samaratan type of family man picks her up thinking that she is really a person in need of help, and circumstances come together so that Aileen chooses to kill him also, that we see her final sentence is just and we can leave the end of the film with a sense of closure.Christina Ricci plays the lost lesbian girl that was Eileen's partner in these final months and during the murder spree.

Her past is definitely a part in the story.  As we hate to admit it, the past has a great deal to do with our future.  This women wanted to be loved and did not receive love and her mental state had a lot to do with her killing others.

622433,A6DOCZ10B7JAJ,B00005JMUK,"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[8, 8]","The rage of Aileen Wournos is yanked from the past and and viciously strewn upon the screen.  Sweat, blood, tears--they're all shed here in brutal fashion.  This harrowing depiction packs a grip like a bull rider's and refuses to let you go.This is due in large part to Charlize Theron's complete transformation.  She encompassses everything about the serial killer--her temper, mindset, hopes, fears, anxiety.  Her lack of education, her state of disarray.  And above all, her need to be loved.Wournos unraveling from a desperate prostitute into a psychotic murderer ironically came shortly after meeting her female love interest, played with subtle precision by Christina Ricci.  It's easy to overlook her superb performance due to the overbearing presence of Theron.  But she is outstanding in this role as a naive, meager young woman who also needs some companionship.The story progresses with sort of an edgy discomfort.  There are moments of humor, shock, disbelief, and pity.  There are times you'll be staring at the screen, unsure of how to react.  Kinda like when someone tells a joke that you don't really get.  The violence can knock you off balance.I love how the momentum accelerates and doesn't let up.  It plunges through the murders like a runaway train.  Aileen was a startling head case, ready to derail at any given moment.Overall, this movie will cause vastly different reactions.  Some might conceive it as an anti-death penalty statement.  Others might simply sit back and say well, justice was done.  I think the director tries to make the viewer see some of the reasons behind the ""Monster's"" madness.  Her actions aren't condoned(with one possible exception), but hopefully this story will provoke a certain degree of empathy.  Quite an absorbing account of this true story, with the best female acting tandem that I have ever seen.

But for her role in the 2003 film, Monster, no one had expected see this beautiful girl take on a role so horrifying. That role is the real life role of serial killer & prostitute, Aileen Wuornos.Aileen Wuornos (played the beautiful Charlize Theron) has grown up living the worst life you could even possible think of. She was raped and beaten. You would think she would have at least one day to be happy during her adolescent years. But Aileen had one day killed the man who she was living with the time for raping her and beating her.No grown up and living Florida, Aileen has no professional job. Instead, she earns living as a prostitute. Living with her is Selby (played by Christina Ricci), who has made abundantly clear that is a full-blown out Lesbian. Together, Aileen and Selby have developed a friendship, which goes into a sort of love affair. Because of her rotten teen years, Aileen is all screwed up. I mean, she is experiment with lesbianism, she is prostituting all over Florida. Now, she lures men into thinking she'll give them a quick bang in the backseat of their cars. Apparently, the men do get a quick bang in the backseat, but the bang is not even close to sex; the quick bang is a gunshot, coming from the gun owned by Aileen. Seven murders later, Aileen is arrested and taken to court, after she allows Selby to go free, since she has nothing to do with the murders. Aileen was locked up, sentenced for life, where she and Selby never spoke again. On October 29th, 2002, Aileen was executed after a 12-year trial.For this role, Charlize Theron's beauty had vanished into the hideous face of Aileen Wuornos. Because of her outstanding portrayal as the psychotic woman, Charlize had received the Oscar for Best Actress. And I tell you something, this woman more than deserved the award. Aileen may have been a complete wacko, meaning she lied about the whole ordeal she went through, while growing up, Charlize had portrayed this character so brilliantly that there was no choice, but to allow Charlize to be the only actress to win this Oscar award.

622437,AGAJITEU64H4A,B00005JMUK,Cheri Crystal,"[2, 2]","Monster, starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci is a disturbing film based on the true story of a destitute, drug-addicted prostitute and serial killer, Aileen Wuornos. For me, the best part of the film is the stunning performance by Charlize Theron as she transforms herself completely into the Wuornos character, both physically and psychologically. Her every move, and inflection of her voice is impeccable in her portrayal. Theron's 2004 Academy Award for best actress is well deserved. Christina Ricci's performance as Wuornos's lover is incredible. I had no prior knowledge of the true events of Aileen Wuornos's life before watching Monster, therefore, I am only commenting on the merits of the film, its cast, and writer/director Patty Jenkins. The make-up artist, Toni G, who expertly transformed Theron into Wuornos, did an amazing job. She turns a beautiful model into a person who had clearly never taken care of herself, and had abused her body most of her life.Monster is a very sad story of a girl who is so depressed she contemplates suicide, which in retrospect would have saved the lives of seven men. One rainy night, at her lowest point, Aileen ends up in a sleazy gay bar where she is picked up by Selby-a lonely girl whose true ambition is to get away from her fundamentalist father, and the aunt she was sent to live with. Aileen tells Selby to get lost, that she's not gay, but she ends up spending the night in the girl's bed anyway. They just sleep, but the relationship develops into much more as time passes. It seems Aileen has never experienced love, or a semblance of it, in her entire life. Even though the movie did not leave me happy, I could not stop watching it. Not knowing the story before hand increased my suspense. I was mesmerized by Theron and Ricci's performances. I could see what caused Wuornos to snap and kill the john who physically beat her almost to death, but I was horrified that she was able to kill repeatedly. The fact that Wuornos was sexually abused as a child, uneducated, and unloved had a lot to do with the way she turned out. Her background cannot be overlooked. Though not an excuse for committing murder, Aileen justifies her actions by feeling that men aren't worthy of living...they are all dangerous predators. At one point in the film, Wournos expresses a desire to turn her life around and find a respectable job. Her attempts end in failure, but she is desperate to keep Selby happy. Selby encourages Aileen to keep tricking in order to avoid being hungry, and to continue having a good time. Alcohol, drugs, food, and motel rooms cost money, and if Aileen can't get a real job, she'll have to remain a hooker. I don't think Selby planned on Aileen's brutally murdering the men she enticed, but she's sure happy with the money.What bothered me about the film, beside the story itself, is that Hollywood thinks nothing of showing heavy petting between two women, but they loathe, or are too afraid to show the same situation with two men. I feel Hollywood has the responsibility to depict loving LGBT relationships instead of concentrating on the dregs of society. While Monster did not glorify lesbian relationships, I honestly believe that Aileen truly loved Selby Wall on some level. The love scenes were more than convincing without being too graphic, even though Wuornos claimed she was not gay. Perhaps she used the excuse of love to justify killing her johns--after taking their money and cars. Another take would be that Aileen would have loved anyone who cared about her. You have to wonder if Selby really loved Aileen, or if she was just using her to escape her homophobic family. Either way, it's a tragic story all around--but still worth watching.Do I recommend the movie? The answer would have to be yes, and no. I think the movie was very well made, but I don't think depressing movies are for everyone. No matter how you look at it, Wuornos was a murderer. Even though she was abused and neglected as a child, and didn't have anyone who cared about her, nor did she have a good role model, she was still responsible for her own actions. In the beginning, Monster makes the audience sympathetic towards Aileen...she is so pitiful. When she's seeking honest employment, even when she fell in love with Selby, I felt myself rooting for her to turn her life around. However, when she started killing all those men, she became a monster and had to be stopped.

622438,A2BZXELIWQ48X2,B00005JMUK,"cherrymerrymuffins ""Samurai Babe""","[1, 2]","I'd been wanting to see ""Monster"" for a while.  Once I did, I wasn't so sure if that had been a good idea or not.  I knew to expect a lot of blood, sexual stuff, and a ton of emotions, but I was looking more for something of a TV movie nature.  However, I will not take away from this movie's many cinematic achievements.  It is a bold drama that takes many risks in the movie business--the casting of a beautiful starlet (Charlize Theron) as a murderous prostitute, the shooting of realistic love scenes between two straight actresses, and the list goes on....The result is a twisting, turning, story with unbelievable outcomes.  Since it is based on actual events, ""Monster""'s negative portrayal of the sex trade is that much more astounding.  For many viewers, this may be a ""reality check""-type glimpse into the often-glamorized world of prostitution.

Theron delivers a true, jaw-droppingly good, transformative performance.  Having seen many documentaries on Wuornos, I was familliar with her, and Theron absolutely channels this woman.  Her physical transformation alone is brilliant, but the way she adds a depth of humanity and pathos to a very unsympathetic person is astounding.  It's not just a question of good 'mimickry,' but you actually do learn about how Aileen viewed the world, and can see it from her point of view, based solely on Theron's heartbreaking performance.  It truly is well worth purchasing this DVD, because work this good is rare.The story, however, leaves alot to be desired.

Unlike some, at least, though, that transformation didn't distract me from her performance because both are just so superbly well done. Charlize the model is so completely removed in sight and psyche that I ceased to think about it. I simply watched an amazing and, yes, Oscar-worthy performance. This is a tremendous acting achievement from someone who heretofore had precious little to indicate this level of potential. As I say, wow.I can understand where some might find Theron's performance a little over the top, but personally I didn't think so. Knowing nothing of the real Aileen Wuornos, it struck me as merely the grandiosity of someone whose self has become so stretched beyond the bounds of normal behavior. I also understand but disagree with the opinion of some that the movie dismisses Wuornos' crimes behind so much PC victimology. The unfortunate truth is that whereas many killers are in fact born with an evil bone (and I'll brook no arguments that they aren't), some are indeed bred to it by circumstance. This doesn't excuse their behavior, it merely explains its source, which is what I believe Monster does very well. I think in the scenes where she does feel pity and shows mercy, the movie illustrates that Aileen does indeed know right from wrong, so that later, when she doesn't show that mercy, it's clear she's consciously chosen the wrong, and for the wrong reasons. I just didn't get from the movie the message that she didn't deserve her punishment.The only minor negative I found in the movie was Christina Ricci's performance. That's not to say it wasn't good, but it struck me as merely that. In retrospect I think she could have occupied the role better. Though in all fairness to her, it may be only that Charlize is so good, Christina by comparison comes off as merely effective.This is a difficult movie to watch, no doubt about it. It's one of those I'd usually choose to watch on video at home, due to the almost voyeuristic nature of watching something so intensely personal. But I didn't want to wait to check out Charlize's performance. I'd suggest others do the same. The movie is excellent--literally, directorially, musically--but Charlize Theron is outstanding.

Middleton,"[2, 2]","If there was ever a more deserved academy award for a lead dramatic performance, Charlize Theron as serial killer, Aileen Wuormos, it most certainly is this one. Take away the latex, make-up and false teeth, the extra thirty pounds and damaged blond hair, and you would still have the unnerving personification of this tragic woman.This dark tale, based on a true story, is disturbing on many levels. The character of Aileen Wuormos, on one level, is a terrible indictment of a compassionless society. A more accurate title for this film would be, ""The Making of a Serial Killer."" Aileen Wuormas was sexually abused as a young child by one of her father's best friends, and then beaten severely by her father for telling him. In effect, this little child was raped on a continual basis throughout puberty. Forced on the street at thirteen years of age, she turns to prostitution, and lives her life in this manner for the rest of her days. As the character states at one point in the film, no one knows what life is like as a homeless person and a prostitute, unless you are one, it is not an easy life, taking a tremendous amount of will to survive, but if it's the only thing you know to survive, you keep doing it.In a seeming compassionless world, she meets a lonely young woman who reaches out to her. Selby (Christina Ricci) is a lovely enough girl, naive and inexperienced, but is weak, incapable of action, and utterly dependent. Though for the strong and independent Aileen, a perfect partner to care for and love. This is a complicated relationship, but in the end, a transparent one.The turning point in the film, and for Aileen Wuormos, is the unmentionable incident, where she's beaten, made a prisoner, and horrifically raped. To save her life she retaliates as any person in the same situation would, killing her assailant. This sets her off onto a killing spree across Florida, assassinating Johns, found in compromising positions. When she finally confesses to Selby about the murders, her justification is,""Everybody out there is killing and raping, and I'm the one out there killing them"".There is no justifying murder in any situation, unless in self defence, or in the organised arena of war, but writer/director, Patty Jenkins, has endeavoured to reveal to us another side, and that is a victim living on raw hopes and dreams that are continually crushed, unleashing a response, an almost primeval reaction of extreme violence.This is a film that I would have no desire to see again, though brilliant, once is enough, as it is such a tragedy.",5,The Creation of a Killer,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,2564,"['was', 'ever', 'more', 'deserved', 'academy', 'award', 'lead', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'serial', 'killer', 'Aileen', 'Wuormos', 'most', 'certainly', 'one', 'Take', 'away', 'latex', 'make-up', 'false', 'teeth', 'extra', 'thirty', 'pounds', 'damaged', 'blond', 'hair', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'unnerving', 'personification', 'tragic', 'woman.This', 'dark', 'tale', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'disturbing', 'many', 'levels', 'character', 'Aileen', 'Wuormos', 'one', 'level', 'terrible', 'indictment', 'compassionless', 'society', 'more', 'accurate', 'title', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Making', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'Aileen', 'Wuormas', 'was', 'sexually', 'abused', 'young', 'child', 'one', 'father', 'best', 'friends', 'then', 'beaten', 'severely', 'father', 'telling', 'effect', 'little', 'child', 'was', 'raped', 'continual', 'basis', 'puberty', 'Forced', 'street', 'thirteen', 'years', 'age', 'prostitution', 'life', 'manner', 'rest', 'days', 'character', 'states', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'one', 'what', 'life', 'homeless', 'person', 'prostitute', 'are', 'one', 'not', 'easy', 'life', 'taking', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'will', 'survive', 'only', 'thing', 'know', 'survive', 'keep', 'doing', 'it.In', 'seeming', 'compassionless', 'world', 'lonely', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'out', 'Selby', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'lovely', 'enough', 'girl', 'naive', 'inexperienced', 'weak', 'incapable', 'action', 'utterly', 'dependent', 'strong', 'independent', 'Aileen', 'perfect', 'partner', 'care', 'love', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'end', 'transparent', 'one.The', 'turning', 'point', 'film', 'Aileen', 'Wuormos', 'unmentionable', 'incident', 'where', 'beaten', 'made', 'prisoner', 'horrifically', 'raped', 'save', 'life', 'person', 'same', 'situation', 'would', 'killing', 'assailant', 'off', 'killing', 'spree', 'Florida', 'assassinating', 'Johns', 'found', 'compromising', 'positions', 'When', 'finally', 'Selby', 'murders', 'justification', 'Everybody', 'killing', 'raping', ""'m"", 'one', 'there', 'killing', 'justifying', 'murder', 'situation', 'self', 'defence', 'organised', 'arena', 'war', 'writer/director', 'Patty', 'Jenkins', 'endeavoured', 'reveal', 'side', 'victim', 'living', 'raw', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'are', 'continually', 'crushed', 'unleashing', 'response', 'almost', 'primeval', 'reaction', 'extreme', 'violence.This', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'desire', 'see', 'again', 'brilliant', 'once', 'enough', 'such', 'tragedy']",Monster
622445,A2DB22MRLKXUT4,B00005JMUK,"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000""","[0, 0]","Monster is not an entirely perfect film. The story, overall, is pretty weak, and the original score is problematic in that at certain points, it diminishes the emotion instead of magnifying it. Other than that, Monster is a movie that demands the viewers undivided attention, and that's exactly what it gets. Charlize Theron as Aileen Wuornos is a godsend. The character of Aileen is one that is so complex: she's sympathetic, relatable, brutish, and often disgusting. Normally, this kind of range would seem uncomfortable or forced, but Theron pulls off Aileen's attitude with shocking exactitude. Although the performance's legacy may suggest otherwise, Theron playing Aileen does not come off as showy, or like she was going for an oscar-grab. She simply WAS her character and that's all there is to say. Christina Ricci as Selby Wall, Aileen's lesbian lover, proves to be a great foil for Theron. Selby's character, who is easier to pinpoint, isn't any less engaging. She is what makes this movie about a murderous prostitute a story that's grounded in reality (even though it's based off true events). Whether or not Selby truly loved Aileen, she was just a young girl trying to find her place in life and fed off Aileen's dangerous vibes. She lived vicariously through her lover's adventures, and as filmgoers, we can all relate to that. As shocking as it sounds, Selby and Aileen may be one of the most engrossing on-screen couples ever. Bravo to the brilliant actors and a fine script by Patty Jenkins. The visuals by Jenkins and Steven Bernstein are downright tailor-suited for the subject matter. Monster has a very dark and gritty cinematic tone which harkens back to 70's Scorsese, namely Mean Streets and Taxi Driver. The grain and the low lighting mix perfectly well with the trashy retro backdrop to create such a vivid setting for the drama. Monster, at its heart, is a relationship movie. But it is so far removed from the genres implications that it becomes something entirely different and special.

Instead, it fails miserably on both scores, content to have an ABC Afterschool Special like patina in its approach. I also, after viewing this film, know another reason why I wanted to not see it, and that's because after two years of this unjust and wasteful war of invasion President Bush launched in Iraq I did not want to be reminded that sometimes even the reactionary Right Wing Radicals can still be right about something; and that is only a deluded out of touch Hollywood Feminazi sympathizers could serve up such crap, and then fete it ceaselessly. This is one of those films and performances that in ten or so years people will cringe at as being one of the worst selections ever. Let me be the first to say it- Theron's award winning performance is one of the worst to ever win an Oscar- it is not deep, nor scary, and even lacks the essential redeeming silliness of a Hannibal Lecter or Freddy Krueger. This film is one of those that people are just agog at, and so at odds with the Hollywood machine and its fawning parade of acolyte critics, that no one has the guts to say it's terrible.

As I watched the account of this woman's life I was in constant agony for I felt for her and her situation, her horrific lot in life.  Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) is not the monster here.  The monster is the life she led, the life forced upon her, the life that ate at her everyday.  Aileen, prostitute since thirteen, never knew anything more than what she had, and as the film opens we see that she is about to take her own life because of this, that was until she meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci).  Selby (real name was Tyria Moore) is a closet lesbian who wants to come out against the will of her overbearing parents.  She meets Aileen in a gay bar, a place apparently Aileen was unaware was a gay bar, but after they meet they lose something they've felt their whole life...they no longer feel lonely, alone.In order to keep Selby by her side Aileen turns back to prostitution but after being abused horrifically by a 'John' Aileen makes a change.  That's when the murders begin, and even though some are not justified and some are heartbreaking (especially when she murders and innocent man out of pure fear and hopelessness) you never feel as though she deserves what she gets.  She didn't deserve the hand she was dealt and its heart wrenching to see her have to go through everything she went through.  Yes, it's true that not all women who are raped by their father figure turn out to be murderers, but I don't feel that's the reason she killed.  There is so much we don't know about the woman that was Aileen Wuornos, but from Charlize's brilliant performance we gather that she was afraid, she was alone, she was confused and she was emotionally dieing if not already dead.  She had been abused in everyway possible and thrown out without a chance, without a care in the world, even by the ones she loved the most (most notably Selby).This is a truly heartbreaking and, yes, painful film to watch but it's one that we all do well to experience to know the tragedy we ourselves are at times too guarded (and judgmental) against.",4,Painful,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,2160,"['could', 'only', 'use', 'one', 'word', 'describe', 'feeling', 'had', 'when', 'watching', ""'Monster"", 'would', 'be', 'Painful', 'watched', 'account', 'woman', 'life', 'was', 'constant', 'agony', 'felt', 'situation', 'horrific', 'lot', 'life', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'not', 'monster', 'here', 'monster', 'life', 'led', 'life', 'forced', 'life', 'ate', 'everyday', 'Aileen', 'prostitute', 'thirteen', 'never', 'knew', 'anything', 'more', 'what', 'had', 'film', 'see', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'was', 'Selby', 'Wall', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Selby', 'real', 'name', 'was', 'Tyria', 'Moore', 'closet', 'lesbian', 'who', 'come', 'out', 'will', 'overbearing', 'parents', 'Aileen', 'gay', 'bar', 'place', 'apparently', 'Aileen', 'was', 'unaware', 'was', 'gay', 'bar', 'meet', 'lose', 'something', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'whole', 'life', 'no', 'longer', 'feel', 'lonely', 'alone.In', 'order', 'keep', 'Selby', 'side', 'Aileen', 'back', 'prostitution', 'being', 'abused', 'horrifically', ""'John"", 'Aileen', 'change', 'when', 'murders', 'begin', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'justified', 'are', 'heartbreaking', 'especially', 'when', 'murders', 'innocent', 'man', 'pure', 'fear', 'hopelessness', 'never', 'feel', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'hand', 'was', 'dealt', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'see', 'have', 'go', 'everything', 'went', 'Yes', 'true', 'not', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'raped', 'father', 'figure', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'murderers', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'reason', 'killed', 'so', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'woman', 'was', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'Charlize', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'gather', 'was', 'afraid', 'was', 'alone', 'was', 'confused', 'was', 'emotionally', 'dieing', 'not', 'already', 'dead', 'had', 'been', 'abused', 'everyway', 'possible', 'thrown', 'out', 'chance', 'care', 'world', 'even', 'ones', 'loved', 'most', 'most', 'notably', 'Selby', '.This', 'truly', 'heartbreaking', 'yes', 'painful', 'film', 'watch', 'one', 'do', 'well', 'experience', 'know', 'tragedy', 'are', 'times', 'too', 'guarded', 'judgmental']",Monster

622455,A1PLRDMBCSULMI,B00005JMUK,Daniel Ferrisi,"[0, 0]","I have always held firm in believing that the death penalty is a justified, and indeed, necessary, part of our criminal justice system.  Similarly, I have always thought of serial killers as ""monsters"" who prey upon the innocent in the dark of night.  Going into Monster, the new film by Patty Jenkins, I expected to get just such a portrait of Aileen Wuornos.  After all, Wuornos was dubbed by the media as America's first female serial killer and executed in 2002.  What the film reveals about her, though, is much more unsettling than a soulless beast.  Life has chewed Aileen up, spit her out, and wiped its feet on her remains.  Idealism she desperately clung to in her younger days--clung to in spite of increasingly insurmountable roadblocks to normality--has been forcibly extinguished.Charlize Theron gives the best female performance of the year in capturing Aileen physically and emotionally, in both cases a wreck.  The film opens with a suicidal Aileen sitting in the rain getting ready to snuff out her existence.  Having five dollars left from her last john--her only job since her early teens has been prostitution--she enters, unknowingly, a gay bar to have a final drink.  She struts into the place with a gruff and manly persona, an obvious mask to hide the cowering child inside.  A younger and more obviously vulnerable Selby (Christina Ricci) immediately is attracted to her.  Aileen quickly opens herself to Selby and develops perhaps the first real human connection of her life.  Aileen may or may not be gay, but following her experiences, a woman is the only person with whom she can possibly relate.Both Aileen and Selby are on the run, Aileen from a job that is killing her every day and Selby from a father who can't accept her as she is.  Their relationship is far from perfect, but each represents to the other a hand to hold when the silver lining we are told lies in every cloud turns out to be, in fact, lies.  They have a taste of fairy tale happiness, going roller-skating and then making out behind the rink.  We wish they could be transplanted into a more hopeful situation.  But life comes crashing in, and purity disappears.Aileen is brutally raped by a john, and probably saves her life by grabbing a gun from his car and killing him first.  In stealing the rest of his money, Aileen envisions using that seed to grow a life for herself and her new girlfriend.  She springs Selby from the family she's been staying with, cronies of her father, and they run off to a motel together.  Aileen, searching for any straight job available, tries to wedge herself into a society she's never been part of and that coldly rejects any advances she attempts.  Selby, seeing the idealistic mirage starting to fade, explodes at Aileen one night thereby pushing her onto exactly the wrong path.Returning to hooking, Aileen goes out day after day, then returns with a new car and wads of cash.  Selby initially may not see what is happening, but soon becomes an accomplice in enabling Aileen to continue this bloody and tragic method to get a leg-up on life.  But even as the murders continue and sloppiness begins to put the couple at risk, one never loses sight of Aileen's humanity and the underlying motive of her crimes.  She wants enough money to be able to stop selling her body, live an actual life with Selby, and maybe even be accepted by the rest of the planet.  The fact that she has been used her entire life has blinded her to all rationality and sense; she's been trained to believe that the only way to get ahead is to use other people.Aileen cannot be forgiven for committing her murders, which should go without saying.  But, at the same time, how much culpability can be placed on the shoulders of a person who never received a moral compass and whose only education was victimization?  If a dog is beaten by its owner in puppy hood and shown no love, can one possibly be surprised when that dog becomes a vicious adult?  If there is nobody willing to guide the victimized back onto the right path, the outrage we rightfully feel when blood is spilled may be tragically misdirected.Final Film Grade:  A",4,"Aileen Wuornos:  Victimizer, Victim, or both?",1073779200,"01 11, 2004",2004,4146,"['have', 'always', 'held', 'firm', 'believing', 'death', 'penalty', 'justified', 'indeed', 'necessary', 'part', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'Similarly', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'serial', 'killers', 'monsters', 'who', 'prey', 'innocent', 'dark', 'night', 'Going', 'Monster', 'new', 'film', 'Patty', 'Jenkins', 'expected', 'get', 'just', 'portrait', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'dubbed', 'media', 'America', 'first', 'female', 'serial', 'killer', 'executed', '2002', 'What', 'film', 'reveals', 'though', 'much', 'more', 'unsettling', 'soulless', 'beast', 'Life', 'chewed', 'Aileen', 'up', 'spit', 'out', 'wiped', 'feet', 'remains', 'Idealism', 'desperately', 'clung', 'younger', 'days', 'clung', 'spite', 'increasingly', 'insurmountable', 'roadblocks', 'normality', 'been', 'forcibly', 'extinguished.Charlize', 'Theron', 'best', 'female', 'performance', 'year', 'capturing', 'Aileen', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'cases', 'wreck', 'film', 'suicidal', 'Aileen', 'sitting', 'rain', 'getting', 'ready', 'snuff', 'out', 'existence', 'Having', 'five', 'dollars', 'left', 'last', 'john', 'only', 'job', 'early', 'teens', 'been', 'prostitution', 'unknowingly', 'gay', 'bar', 'have', 'final', 'drink', 'place', 'gruff', 'manly', 'persona', 'obvious', 'mask', 'hide', 'cowering', 'child', 'inside', 'A', 'younger', 'more', 'obviously', 'vulnerable', 'Selby', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'Aileen', 'quickly', 'Selby', 'perhaps', 'first', 'real', 'human', 'connection', 'life', 'Aileen', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'gay', 'following', 'experiences', 'woman', 'only', 'person', 'whom', 'can', 'possibly', 'relate.Both', 'Aileen', 'Selby', 'are', 'run', 'Aileen', 'job', 'killing', 'day', 'Selby', 'father', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'relationship', 'far', 'perfect', 'other', 'hand', 'hold', 'when', 'silver', 'lining', 'are', 'told', 'lies', 'cloud', 'out', 'be', 'fact', 'have', 'taste', 'fairy', 'tale', 'happiness', 'going', 'roller-skating', 'then', 'making', 'out', 'rink', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'transplanted', 'more', 'hopeful', 'situation', 'life', 'crashing', 'purity', 'disappears.Aileen', 'brutally', 'raped', 'john', 'probably', 'life', 'grabbing', 'gun', 'car', 'killing', 'first', 'stealing', 'rest', 'money', 'Aileen', 'envisions', 'using', 'seed', 'grow', 'life', 'herself', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Selby', 'family', 'been', 'staying', 'cronies', 'father', 'run', 'off', 'motel', 'together', 'Aileen', 'searching', 'straight', 'job', 'available', 'tries', 'wedge', 'society', 'never', 'been', 'part', 'coldly', 'advances', 'Selby', 'seeing', 'idealistic', 'mirage', 'starting', 'fade', 'explodes', 'Aileen', 'one', 'night', 'thereby', 'pushing', 'onto', 'exactly', 'wrong', 'path.Returning', 'hooking', 'Aileen', 'out', 'day', 'day', 'then', 'new', 'car', 'wads', 'cash', 'Selby', 'initially', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'soon', 'accomplice', 'enabling', 'Aileen', 'continue', 'bloody', 'tragic', 'method', 'get', 'leg-up', 'life', 'even', 'murders', 'continue', 'sloppiness', 'begins', 'put', 'couple', 'risk', 'one', 'never', 'sight', 'Aileen', 'humanity', 'underlying', 'motive', 'crimes', 'enough', 'money', 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'selling', 'body', 'live', 'actual', 'life', 'Selby', 'maybe', 'even', 'be', 'accepted', 'rest', 'planet', 'fact', 'been', 'used', 'entire', 'life', 'blinded', 'rationality', 'sense', 'been', 'trained', 'believe', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'ahead', 'use', 'other', 'people.Aileen', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'forgiven', 'committing', 'murders', 'should', 'go', 'saying', 'same', 'time', 'how', 'much', 'culpability', 'can', 'be', 'placed', 'shoulders', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'received', 'moral', 'compass', 'only', 'education', 'was', 'victimization', 'dog', 'beaten', 'owner', 'puppy', 'hood', 'shown', 'love', 'can', 'one', 'possibly', 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'vicious', 'adult', 'nobody', 'willing', 'guide', 'victimized', 'back', 'right', 'path', 'outrage', 'rightfully', 'feel', 'when', 'blood', 'spilled', 'may', 'be', 'tragically', 'misdirected.Final', 'Film', 'Grade', 'A']",Monster
622456,A3673NBQVA4J2M,B00005JMUK,"Daniel Hayes ""D.R. Hayes""","[0, 0]","I feel that's the whole story of Aileen Wournos. Nortorious prostitute/serial killer. The story was a rather sad one because I can relate to the fact that it seems as though the deck was stacked against her, and no one really seemed to know what to do with helping her, and at times no one seemed to really care. Born in Michigan to a dysfunctional family whose father committed suicide when she was rather young; she gets bounced around all over the place, and along the way she is raped, molested, and gives birth to a child at 13, and then has to put it up for adoption. The allegations are dismissed, and what's worse she's blamed, and thrown out into the snow. She's been humiliated, rejected, violated, and all society can tell her is to turn to God, go to church, deal with it, move on. She does all that, and the end result is she's dumped on even more. It's like she's told that this is what her life's all about that God ordained it; mind you the words weren't uttered, but the sentiment was there. She tries to do honest work, but it doesn't pan out, and men just have a intense hatred towards her and her kind. She decides it doesn't pay to have a relationship with a man, so she turns to a woman named Shelby Wall whose own life is very fragile right now as her legalistic religious family is trying to deprogram her from the lesbian lifestyle, and there's no love for her. Aileen and Shelby find each other, and little by little they fall in love, but Shelby is completely in the dark about Aileen's double life, and in an attempt to tell the truth ends up betraying Aileen. Aileen as portrayed by Charlize Theron was done rather well. Worthy of an oscar. She shows Aileen's attempt to be the kind of woman she always dreamed about: the kind, the holy, the compassionate woman, but the demons of abuse self and infliced on her would not let her go. She tends to show she doesn't trust her own instincts especially when she was told by her true friend that he wanted to get away with her, but she took it to be not pure in motive, but not realizing that the other men around her were 2 undercover police officers. I feel that the one thing that held down Aileen was her inability to realize that her life was made of choices...her choices. She certainly had to make the final decisions of her life, but with no one to love and nurture her she was lost. She had a heart on certain things, and with certain people, but if they were violent towards her they got a one way ticket to the lake of fire, and that was with murder, but with others she had a soft spot like the one who didn't have any money, and she jacked on him to give him relief. I know that her experiences do not warrant murder, but if someone reached out to her she wouldn't have had to murder, but it looks as though no one did. I guess Aileen felt like in the end that Society had to tell her something because we're all human, and it's better to cover up the dirty deeds with something new than to expose everyone's sins. I'm talking about those who used her body for impure motives, beat her up for their own inadequacies, and rejecting her from jobs, from life, and from relationships. Of course the ending seemed choppy, and didn't do much of a courtroom drama, but that's rather good; that's what Lifetime's for. She's convicted, and sentenced to death; I'm sure that Shelby's betrayal was too much for her, and I often wonder what she did for the 12 years on death row? Did she go to the chamber with her heart mind and life unshackled?, or was she as bitter as the day she was when she was thrown out into the streets as a child? I can relate because at times I feel with people's advice that I'm given it's mostly ""They Have To Tell Me Something."" I really don't know why, but I'm sure it's because we're all supposed to believe in something....that's like an unwritten rule, and if you don't believe in anything then that's like telling others ""Life Isn't Worth Living."" It wasn't as dark as I first thought, but it was dark enough.

Charlize was probably one of the most typecast actors in all of Hollywood: the (...), the one who is lusted after. This doesn't make her a bad actor, but it doesn't show her at her best.Charlize's performance as Aileen in 'Monster' definitely breaks all the barriers and wowed me numb. I couldn't believe that she was such a skilled actor that she could turn into something other than the vixen. I was stunned. I was flabbergasted.

She also totally became a character that doesn't seem to 'fit' her.Despite these amazing performances, I must give the film three stars.

622458,A3KOVFORKXQ2U9,B00005JMUK,Daniel McInnis,"[5, 6]","Let me preface this by saying that ""Monster"" is in my opinion the best film of 2004, but it may also be one of the most infuriating for me personally.  You see, as a fairly unattractive human being, it's always bothered me when gorgeous people have complained about not being taken seriously, and I guess I never really thought that this was a concern of Charlize Theron's.  I mean, she's always been one of the sexiest actresses in Hollywood, and extremely capable in guilty-pleasures like ""The Italian Job"" and ""Reindeer Games"" (yes, I really liked that movie).  But the one thing we, the average-looking people of Earth, have always had on her and her kind, was that we made really great, gritty, personal films.  Now, though, even that's being taken away from us.  With this movie, she, along with writer/director Patty Jenkins, have taken our last bastion of usefulness.  Soon we'll all be expendable...I write this in jest, of course, but her performance truly is exceptional, and not just because of the physical transformation, which in my opinion has slightly overshadowed just how remarkable her embodiment of the character really is.  This is one of ""those,"" and by those, I mean something that simply can't be put into words. Oh, and by the way, the movie ain't bad either.How good is it?  Let me tell you a brief story.  I walked nearly two miles in twenty-below windchills to see this film the first day of it's release in Toledo.  And as I settled into my seat, beginning to warm up, all I could think about was how miserable the walk home was gonna be (I'd have to cover the same distance, only this time without the sunlight).  But soon thereafter, the projector began to roll, and as the movie started, everything else just seemed to fade away.  I was hooked.  I sat riveted to my seat, and never once thought about the long trek home, or any other external factor for that matter.  Wanna know what's more impressive?  When I finally did get around to leaving the theater to head home, I didn't even notice how cold it was.  I just kept replaying the movie in my head, over and over again.  Some scenes are just that unforgettable.For example, the ""Judas"" scene, as I've come to dub it.  We all know that it's coming, at least anyone familiar with law enforcement does, yet when it happens, somehow it manages not lose a bit of it's potency or power.  Now that's filmmaking!  The camera pans, we see a shadow on the wall, and suddenly the betrayal becomes hauntingly clear.Having said that, you may ask, ""What are the film's faults,"" and I'd be naive to deny that there aren't some, the most obvious of which being that Aileen, as portrayed in this film, comes off as entirely too sympathetic.  I was with her every step of the way and, though I already knew the outcome, was still hoping for the happy ending I knew was never going to come.  Whose fault is this, you ask?  The answer might surprise you.Christina Ricci.  That's right, the little girl from ""The Adams Family"" is the linchpin of this film.  It's only because of her, and the way she's able to make us, the audience, fall in love with her, that we're able to understand, and even empathize with Aileen.  I can even pinpoint the exact moment that this happens.  It's as the couple, Aileen and Selby (Ricci), rollerblade to a 80's rock ballad, a song that I never really cared for, but having seen it in the context of this film have come to appreciate (not unlike Martin Scorsese's brilliant knack for taking so-so pop songs and making them transcend their cheesiness).  But getting back to ""the moment,"" Charlize looks deep into her big, brown eyes, the music swells, and that's it.

Had she relied solely on the amazing makeup and weight gain for the role that transformed her physically, Charlize would not have been able to convince us that she was Aileen Wournos.  But she took that step a really good actor or actress makes to really become the person she is portraying and really made the role believable and thorougly watchable. Christina Ricci was also good as the young woman, who beguiles Wournos and then betrays her once the truth is revealed about her killing spree.

622460,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B00005JMUK,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[5, 9]","I sometimes wonder why more people can't be nice. I wonder why the sins of the father have to plague the lives of his children. Why people rape, abuse, hurt, and maim. In a perfect world everyone would be happy. In a perfect world no one would ever want. In a perfect world a women like Aileen Wurnos would not have been sentenced to die on death row, and in a real world I wouldn't have to write about a movie like MONSTER. It's a movie that drips with exceptional performances, and yet leaves your soul so cold to the core.MONSTER is the tragic true story of a woman who longed for a friend, and nobody came to her aid. It stars Charlize Theron (The Devil's Advocate) as Aileen Wurnos, one of the first women to ever die on death row. Of course the film doesn't begin that way, when we first meet her she's sitting in the rain with a gun contemplating ending it all. You see she's has no future. She has nothing but a past that's not worth repeating, and all she has in the world is in a storage locker. What little money she has, is gained by being a prostitute. But one day in a little bar in Daytona Beach, Florida she meets and falls for a woman that finally makes her happy.The woman is named Selby (Christina Ricci, The Opposite of Sex), and she's a young lesbian just trying to figure out the world for herself. At first this relationship puts Aileen on cloud nine. She's willing to do anything to provide for the first person that ever loved her.But one night when Aileen kills a john who gets a little to rough, a series of events take our characters on a one way trip with destiny. Leaving the landscape of these two women's lives are forever changed. If only someone had just been nice to Aileen.MONSTER is not a happy film. It's one of those movies that leaves you dead at the end. You lose faith in humanity; you lose faith in yourself. I like these kinds of movies, cause they convict me. Here I am a young guy who sometimes gets ticked off at a driver in front of me on the road. For one split moment I have murderous anger when that guy cuts me off. What if I was in Aileen's situation? Would I do the same thing? I would hope not, but hey you never know.If there is one performance that will tear you up inside this year, it's Theron's. For the entire movie you can hardly believe that this is, in real life, a beautiful women. Theron throws all the glamour out the window, gaining weight and frumping herself up to the point of being ugly. This is a complete 360 and she's so engrossing. She carries the film to heights. A lesser actress might turn in a wonderful performance, but Theron was Aileen. This is some brilliant acting.I also give Kudos to Bruce Dern . His character has the distinction of being the only person who shows any real compassion for Aileen. While a small role it sticks out because it's the only real bit of bright light in an otherwise dark and gloomy picture.The screenplay by Patty Jenkins (Who also directed) does a great job of giving Aileen and those around her life. What Aileen did was reprehensible. What she did was evil, and she must pay for that. But it allows for sympathy. Not all evil is dark and black, and not all people who murder are 100% culpable. But yet you reap what you sow no matter what you're past.MONSTER is a well-made, brilliantly acted film that's not for the weak of heart. It's engaging, engrossing, and realistic. I think I want to rush out and get the silliest comedy I can find right now, because I need something to offset the dark tone of this film. While it get a fine recommendation, I just hope that the next time you feel like treating someone like crap, you'll remember just how tragic the life of Aileen Wurnos turned tragic because nobody reached out.",5,Why won't anyone be nice to Aileen Wurnos??,1074816000,"01 23, 2004",2004,3740,"['sometimes', 'wonder', 'why', 'more', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice', 'wonder', 'why', 'sins', 'father', 'have', 'plague', 'lives', 'children', 'Why', 'people', 'rape', 'abuse', 'hurt', 'maim', 'perfect', 'world', 'everyone', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'perfect', 'world', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'perfect', 'world', 'women', 'Aileen', 'Wurnos', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'sentenced', 'die', 'death', 'row', 'real', 'world', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'write', 'movie', 'MONSTER', 'movie', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'yet', 'soul', 'so', 'cold', 'core.MONSTER', 'tragic', 'true', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'longed', 'friend', 'nobody', 'came', 'aid', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'Aileen', 'Wurnos', 'one', 'first', 'women', 'ever', 'die', 'death', 'row', 'course', 'film', ""n't"", 'begin', 'way', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'sitting', 'rain', 'gun', 'contemplating', 'ending', 'see', 'future', 'nothing', 'past', 'not', 'worth', 'repeating', 'world', 'storage', 'locker', 'What', 'little', 'money', 'gained', 'being', 'prostitute', 'one', 'day', 'little', 'bar', 'Daytona', 'Beach', 'Florida', 'woman', 'finally', 'happy.The', 'woman', 'named', 'Selby', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'young', 'lesbian', 'just', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'world', 'herself', 'first', 'relationship', 'Aileen', 'cloud', 'nine', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'provide', 'first', 'person', 'ever', 'loved', 'her.But', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'Aileen', 'john', 'who', 'little', 'rough', 'series', 'events', 'take', 'characters', 'one', 'way', 'trip', 'destiny', 'Leaving', 'landscape', 'two', 'women', 'lives', 'are', 'forever', 'changed', 'only', 'someone', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'nice', 'Aileen.MONSTER', 'not', 'happy', 'film', 'one', 'movies', 'dead', 'end', 'lose', 'faith', 'humanity', 'lose', 'faith', 'kinds', 'movies', 'cause', 'convict', 'Here', 'am', 'young', 'guy', 'who', 'ticked', 'off', 'driver', 'front', 'road', 'one', 'split', 'moment', 'have', 'murderous', 'anger', 'when', 'guy', 'cuts', 'off', 'What', 'was', 'Aileen', 'situation', 'Would', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'would', 'hope', 'not', 'hey', 'never', 'know.If', 'one', 'performance', 'will', 'tear', 'up', 'year', 'Theron', 'entire', 'movie', 'can', 'hardly', 'believe', 'real', 'life', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Theron', 'glamour', 'window', 'gaining', 'weight', 'frumping', 'point', 'being', 'ugly', 'complete', '360', 'so', 'engrossing', 'film', 'heights', 'lesser', 'actress', 'might', 'turn', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Theron', 'was', 'Aileen', 'brilliant', 'acting.I', 'also', 'give', 'Kudos', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'character', 'distinction', 'being', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'real', 'compassion', 'Aileen', 'small', 'role', 'out', 'only', 'real', 'bit', 'bright', 'light', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'picture.The', 'screenplay', 'Patty', 'Jenkins', 'Who', 'also', 'directed', 'great', 'job', 'giving', 'Aileen', 'life', 'What', 'Aileen', 'did', 'was', 'reprehensible', 'What', 'did', 'was', 'evil', 'must', 'pay', 'sympathy', 'Not', 'evil', 'dark', 'black', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'murder', 'are', '100', '%', 'culpable', 'yet', 'reap', 'what', 'sow', 'matter', 'what', ""'re"", 'past.MONSTER', 'well-made', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'film', 'not', 'weak', 'heart', 'engaging', 'engrossing', 'realistic', 'think', 'want', 'rush', 'out', 'get', 'silliest', 'comedy', 'can', 'find', 'right', 'now', 'need', 'something', 'offset', 'dark', 'tone', 'film', 'get', 'fine', 'recommendation', 'just', 'hope', 'next', 'time', 'feel', 'treating', 'someone', 'crap', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'just', 'how', 'tragic', 'life', 'Aileen', 'Wurnos', 'turned', 'tragic', 'nobody', 'reached', 'out']",Monster
622461,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B00005JMUK,David Anderson,"[2, 2]","&quot;Monster&quot; is one of the most talked about films of 2003, not just because of Charlize Theron's groundbreaking performance.  This is one of the most daring films released that year.  It desplicts the life of the first female serial killer in US history, Aileen Wuournos.  It explores the time between Wuournos moved to Florida to her meeting girlfriend Selby to her making her first killing to the conclusion.  The brilliant plot digs deeper than just a woman who kills.  It shows how she became so angry of life, influencing her murders.  Contrary to popular belief, the crew assures that they do not symphathize her murders.  The chain of events has the level of direct impact to keep audiences on the edge of their seats.  The powerful theme never fades for a moment throughout the film.Charlize Theron's performance as Aileen Wuournos is one of the best in many years.  Film critic Leonard Maltin once said that this is the best performance in cinema history.  He may be correct.  There was never a year that any actress was as well-deserving of every Best Actress award in existance, including the Oscar and the Golden Globe.  Such acting quality goes beyond gaining thirty pounds and abandoning the Hollywood glamour for a while.  She almost literally became Wuournos.  Her facial expressions, her physical mannerisms, her vocal style, and her presence resemble the real-life Wuournos.  Therefore, she clearly researched her role thoroughly.  Theron never loses that presence for a moment.Christina Ricci's underrated performance as Wuournos's girlfriend Selby is wonderful.  Her character's compassion and her anger is well expressed in the film.  Thought the role is not as demanding as Theron's, she still proves that she is a rare young talent.  All other actors present themselves wonderfully.The physical surroundings, including the buildings and the make-up, greatly add to the gloomy film theme.  It wondefully desplicts Aileen Wuournos's extension to her life.  The make-up team wonderfully transformed Charlize Theron's face and skin into Wuournos's, making Theron resemble her much closer.  Such accomplishment also offers a deeper to Wuournos's painful past.&quot;Monster&quot; is an unforgettable experience for its audiences.  It is sure to please them for a long time.

Her performance is not all make-up, prosthetics and weight gain.  Theron gets inside the skin of this used and abused and ultimately evil individual.  Christina Ricci matches her as her naive lover and unwitting accomplice.  Also, any film that features Bruce Dern, albeit in a smallish role, is aces in my book.  As tawdry as the tale here is, it is not done in an exploitative manner.  That said, this is not the type of film I care to re-visit very often.

622463,A63K426WZXU0D,B00005JMUK,David,"[2, 2]","I watched Monster without any expectations, save knowing that it was a movie about two women. At the end of the screening, i was totally blown away. One, Charlize Theron gives a spectacular performance as 'serial killer' Aileen Wuornos. Her facial expressions and bodily movements strongly resemble that of the actual person (based on what i read). Secondly, the 'human' aspect of Aileen was brought out in the film, and despite her brutal killings, one can symphatise with aspects of her life which brought her to this point of no return when she started killing her johns. Thirdly, although Monster is primarily about Aileen the killer, yet the viewer is treated to a love story between Aileen and her lesbian lover. This is in many aspects, the driving force of the film and which makes the film memorable. Some prison psychologists had diagnosed Aileen as having Borderline personality disorder, which explains her behaviour of wanting to keep Selby Wall, her girlfriend (in real life, the girl's name is Tyria Moore) at all costs, despite the fact that Selby was at times a selfish, immature person who ultimately betrayed Aileen. The final scene of the 'confession' phone call (which basically nailed it for Aileen) is heartbreaking. Aileen basically took the fall for everything and absolved Selby of any blame. Even though the audience may sense a taste of Hollywood drama here, one must remember that in real life, Aileen did take the blame for everything, and even went to the extent of sending Tyria money while she was on death row. Perhaps this is a glimpse into a rare aspect of her life (which traditional documentaries on her never cover), which shows us that at the end of the day, she is a human being like the rest of us and despite her heinous crimes, she too longed to be loved and feel love. The betrayal scene will stick in my mind for a long time to come.

622466,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JMUK,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 5]","As advertised (and Academy-awarded) this movie contains a brilliant, startling and sensational performance by Charlize Theron as the true-life prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Theron is over the top yet at the same time so totally controlled that her character is beautifully--if horrifically--realized.  Opening as a much-abused street hooker who is treated like trash by almost everybody, Theron morphs ""Lee"" into a swaggering, macho murderess in a manner sure to chill many viewers straight to the bone.  Yet all the while Theron conveys the vulnerability of a tragically twisted person who was never loved, only beaten, raped and tossed aside.  The sordidness of her life and the hopelessness of her future are indelibly etched upon our memory.Much of the credit for this once in a lifetime performance must go to director Patty Jenkins who also wrote the script, which is itself quite a sensation.  Jenkins books no compromise with propriety or with the audience's sensitivities.  She rubs our face in Aileen's dehumanized life as a street hooker picked up by strangers who treat her like filth and abuse her in ways that are unspeakable.  Central to the irony of the film is the fact that her life is that of a likely serial killer victim herself, since women who ply their trade in such a way are most vulnerable to sadistic attacks.  But ""Lee,"" inspired by her passionate and first-in-a-lifetime love for Selby, her mousy lesbian girl friend, played with sly and sneaky sparkle by Christina Ricci, turns the tables on the sickies who pick her up and finds a measure of short-lived empowerment by blowing the johns away with a large revolver.Jenkins uses quick and deft strokes to establish who and what Aileen is, and just as deftly establishes Selby as the church-going wallflower at the local same-sex bar.  Jenkins's technique thrusts the viewer headlong into the story as Aileen drags herself out of the rain and into the bar to meet Selby who immediately latches onto her.  Quickly they become friends, and then in a compelling and entirely convincing scene, fall in love while roller skating.  This is followed by a steamy alley engagement in which both ""Lee"" and Selby discover their wild passion for one another.  Both scenes are among the best of their type that I have ever seen.Although Theron got the major share of the glory for the success of this movie, and Jenkins most of the credit, Ricci was not far behind.  Her character too is etched in my mind.  How wonderfully cast were the two, the one physical and manlike, the other weak, naive and femme.  And how lifelike the chemistry and how tragic the conjoining.Yes, this is an American tragedy thurbo'ed up for sensation-seeking audiences, presented with relentless views of violence and sensuality, featuring humanity at its most debased.  So over-the-top were some of the scenes that I found myself unaccountably laughing in surprise at the sheer hutzpa of Jenkins's savage treatment.Be forewarned that this movie leaves little to the imagination, and when it does, it makes sure you know exactly what depravity you are to imagine.  As such I would not recommend that anyone with delicate sensibilities view it.  It is a study of the character of two women who find first love and first real passion together, but it is so thoroughly laced with violence and depravity that for many that love will become nothing more than ignoble animal lust.See this for both Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, two of cinema's most gifted young actresses.",4,"Riveting, sensational, and horrific",1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2005,3528,"['advertised', 'Academy-awarded', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'startling', 'sensational', 'performance', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'true-life', 'prostitute/serial', 'killer', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'Theron', 'top', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'so', 'totally', 'controlled', 'character', 'beautifully', 'horrifically', 'realized', 'Opening', 'much-abused', 'street', 'hooker', 'who', 'treated', 'trash', 'almost', 'everybody', 'Theron', 'Lee', 'swaggering', 'macho', 'murderess', 'manner', 'sure', 'chill', 'many', 'viewers', 'straight', 'bone', 'while', 'Theron', 'vulnerability', 'tragically', 'twisted', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'loved', 'only', 'beaten', 'raped', 'tossed', 'aside', 'sordidness', 'life', 'hopelessness', 'future', 'are', 'indelibly', 'etched', 'memory.Much', 'credit', 'once', 'lifetime', 'performance', 'must', 'go', 'director', 'Patty', 'Jenkins', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'quite', 'sensation', 'Jenkins', 'books', 'compromise', 'propriety', 'audience', 'sensitivities', 'rubs', 'face', 'Aileen', 'dehumanized', 'life', 'street', 'hooker', 'picked', 'up', 'strangers', 'who', 'treat', 'filth', 'abuse', 'ways', 'are', 'unspeakable', 'Central', 'irony', 'film', 'fact', 'life', 'likely', 'serial', 'killer', 'victim', 'women', 'who', 'ply', 'trade', 'such', 'way', 'are', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'sadistic', 'attacks', 'Lee', 'inspired', 'passionate', 'first-in-a-lifetime', 'love', 'Selby', 'mousy', 'lesbian', 'girl', 'friend', 'played', 'sly', 'sneaky', 'sparkle', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'tables', 'sickies', 'who', 'pick', 'up', 'measure', 'short-lived', 'empowerment', 'blowing', 'johns', 'away', 'large', 'revolver.Jenkins', 'quick', 'deft', 'strokes', 'establish', 'who', 'what', 'Aileen', 'just', 'as', 'deftly', 'Selby', 'church-going', 'wallflower', 'local', 'same-sex', 'bar', 'Jenkins', 'technique', 'viewer', 'headlong', 'story', 'Aileen', 'rain', 'bar', 'meet', 'Selby', 'who', 'immediately', 'Quickly', 'become', 'friends', 'then', 'compelling', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'scene', 'fall', 'love', 'roller', 'skating', 'followed', 'steamy', 'alley', 'engagement', 'Lee', 'Selby', 'discover', 'wild', 'passion', 'one', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'type', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Although', 'Theron', 'got', 'major', 'share', 'glory', 'success', 'movie', 'most', 'credit', 'Ricci', 'was', 'not', 'far', 'character', 'too', 'etched', 'mind', 'How', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'were', 'two', 'one', 'physical', 'manlike', 'other', 'weak', 'naive', 'femme', 'how', 'lifelike', 'chemistry', 'how', 'tragic', 'conjoining.Yes', 'American', 'tragedy', ""thurbo'ed"", 'up', 'sensation-seeking', 'audiences', 'presented', 'relentless', 'views', 'violence', 'sensuality', 'featuring', 'humanity', 'most', 'debased', 'So', 'over-the-top', 'were', 'scenes', 'found', 'unaccountably', 'laughing', 'surprise', 'sheer', 'hutzpa', 'Jenkins', 'savage', 'treatment.Be', 'forewarned', 'movie', 'little', 'imagination', 'when', 'sure', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'depravity', 'are', 'imagine', 'such', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'delicate', 'sensibilities', 'view', 'study', 'character', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'find', 'first', 'love', 'first', 'real', 'passion', 'together', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'laced', 'violence', 'depravity', 'many', 'love', 'will', 'become', 'nothing', 'more', 'ignoble', 'animal', 'lust.See', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'two', 'cinema', 'most', 'gifted', 'young', 'actresses']",Monster

622468,AN5V2ZNEVLE0Q,B00005JMUK,dictionellee.com,"[1, 3]","In Monster(2003), Theron plays Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute turned serial killer in Florida, who was eventually executed for her crimes.Having seen much about Aileen on various news programs, documentaries, and crime shows, I was familiar with her courtroom antics, and her striking appearance. She was probably the only person on Earth anything close to Aileen Wournos. That is most likely a good thing.The film centers on Aileen's relationship with a lesbian named Selby. They meet by chance, and have a bond that transcends sexuality, or common sense (as some might see it). Selby enters into Wournos' life at the wrong time, and is caught up in the whirlwind of a spree she may or may not have been fully aware of.Christina Ricci is a weak-spined, naive, and tiny person compared to Theron (who gained 30 lbs for the role). She holds nowhere near the screen presence of her looming caretaker. As Ricci has not shown such absences in previous films, I believe this was a character choice, and is quite effective, though distracting. She's a bit uneven as Wuornos' lover, friend, concubine.Theron, on the other hand, transforms her classic looks into a mirror image of the infamous female serial murderer. Gone are her curves and facial chisels. Here, she is simply unrecognizable.Her performance lives up to the physicality on screen. Her Aileen is tough, desperate, deep, and troubled. Rarely can an actor portray so many levels of psyche whilst shooting guns, and baring a nude body covered in blood.It's subjective whether or not Monster asks you to feel sorry for Wournos' plight. There is ample material to both fear her, and fear for children like her. That's one of the surprises about this film...just when you think you're being steered to an emotional level, you're taken down a completely opposite path.Sadly, the film was not highly stylized, which would have added greatly to the immense portrayal of this woman. Beyond a tendency to stay in tight during dramatic moments, and some courier-style font for graphics, there is little to no tone set by the film.All is left to Theron to carry.She does not fail.Simply a brilliant performance for the actress, and a chilling look at a woman who was a real Monster.",4,I sentence Charlize Theron to the Oscar for this one,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,2225,"['Monster', '2003', 'Theron', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'prostitute', 'turned', 'serial', 'killer', 'Florida', 'who', 'was', 'eventually', 'executed', 'crimes.Having', 'seen', 'much', 'Aileen', 'various', 'news', 'programs', 'documentaries', 'crime', 'shows', 'was', 'familiar', 'courtroom', 'antics', 'striking', 'appearance', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'person', 'Earth', 'anything', 'close', 'Aileen', 'Wournos', 'most', 'likely', 'good', 'thing.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Aileen', 'relationship', 'lesbian', 'named', 'Selby', 'meet', 'chance', 'have', 'bond', 'sexuality', 'common', 'sense', 'might', 'see', 'Selby', 'enters', 'Wournos', 'life', 'wrong', 'time', 'caught', 'up', 'whirlwind', 'spree', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'fully', 'aware', 'of.Christina', 'Ricci', 'weak-spined', 'naive', 'tiny', 'person', 'compared', 'Theron', 'who', 'gained', '30', 'lbs', 'role', 'nowhere', 'screen', 'presence', 'looming', 'caretaker', 'Ricci', 'not', 'shown', 'such', 'absences', 'previous', 'films', 'believe', 'was', 'character', 'choice', 'quite', 'effective', 'though', 'distracting', 'bit', 'uneven', 'Wuornos', 'lover', 'friend', 'concubine.Theron', 'other', 'hand', 'classic', 'mirror', 'image', 'infamous', 'female', 'serial', 'murderer', 'Gone', 'are', 'curves', 'facial', 'chisels', 'Here', 'simply', 'unrecognizable.Her', 'performance', 'up', 'physicality', 'screen', 'Aileen', 'tough', 'desperate', 'deep', 'troubled', 'Rarely', 'can', 'actor', 'portray', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'psyche', 'whilst', 'shooting', 'guns', 'baring', 'nude', 'body', 'covered', 'blood.It', 'subjective', 'not', 'Monster', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Wournos', 'plight', 'ample', 'material', 'fear', 'her', 'fear', 'children', 'one', 'surprises', 'film', 'just', 'when', 'think', ""'re"", 'being', 'steered', 'emotional', 'level', ""'re"", 'taken', 'down', 'completely', 'opposite', 'path.Sadly', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'highly', 'stylized', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'greatly', 'immense', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'tendency', 'stay', 'tight', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'courier-style', 'font', 'graphics', 'little', 'tone', 'set', 'film.All', 'left', 'Theron', 'carry.She', 'not', 'fail.Simply', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'actress', 'chilling', 'look', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'real', 'Monster']",Monster

622477,AWBS5D7SI70S,B00005JMUK,"E. Day ""ENIGMA""","[1, 2]","Simply put I'm a guy that loves his horror movies and murderous villains found within. Yet, despite this morbid fascination that I, and dare i say many others have, i find no other villain more mesmerizing than the real life villains that live amongst us, that we at any time could really become a victim too.Sadly, Hollywood has distorted some of these villains (i.e. yea Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw was based loosely on Ed Gein but its hard to believe he was the unkillable killing machine found in the movies). In MONSTER you watch as the horror of Aileen Carol Wuornos unfold (the scary part about the movie is that they made it more pleasant than it probably was in real life).Here is a woman that had a father who was a child molester, her mother abandoned her to her abusive grandparents, which may or may not have physically and sexually abused her, she alleges she had sex with her brother, she used drugs and was suicidal, she gave her firstborn up for adoption at age 14, oh and did i forget to mention she prostituted for over a decade, since the age of 13, and needless to say rapes, along with other horrors ensued during this period.As you watch, part of you wants to feel that she gets what she deserves in the hardships that play out in her life, you feel that she is worthless trash not worthy of the air she breaths, yet when she meets naive lesbian Selby Wall (wonderfully played by  Christina Ricci) you realize that all Aileen Wuornos ever wanted in life, was to be loved, which Selby Wall is all to willing to give, as a lonely young woman pressured by her overzealous and religious family .By the way this may well rate as the best work Charlize Theron has ever done (she actually put on thirty pounds to play the role). Wuornos at first gives up her former ways of selling herself, wanting to live an honest life and take care of Selby. Sadly, we come to realize that although her motives are pure, the only thing she knows how to do is prostitue and must return to the life she once hated in order to keep the love of her life. But soon after, during a 'date' gone bad Wuornos and Selby's lives fall apart.The question i was left with after watching this movie was why the heck was it made (i mean why give a serial killer more press); but was left to ponder as i did when i watched the end of 'Natural Born Killers', in that society makes these killers, yet we scream for justice when they snap and lash out at the very society that helped make them. I mean really with the upbringing she had what would one expect her to grow up to be; a glowing socialite at the local country club(which ironically she had a chance to do when she married a wealthy 69 year-old yacht club president Lewis Fell, in '76 who later had the marriage anulled)? But i digress..Sorry.Simply put the acting was great, the story completely mesmerizing, and i dare to say better than anything you'll see in the theater, right now. So if you enjoy an awesome story, or are looking to get an inside view of the MONSTERS that are being made today, possibly next door and across the street from you (with that family you think are just living the Clean Cut American Dream) check this movie out.

622480,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B00005JMUK,Erica Anderson,"[1, 2]","I never thought that there would be an actual film based on the first female serial killer Aileen Wournos. I always thought her life was more suited for the Lifetime network. After all her crimes did splash all over the media, especially tv tabloid shows like 'Inside Edition"" and ""Hard Copy"". I was proven wrong when I saw ""Monster"" over the weekend. Long before the Golden Globes, I was curious to see ""Monster"" but after Charlie Theron won best actress for the film, I just had to see it. I am so glad that I saw it. The film is definitely worth the hype and accolades. It annoys me to see people rag on Charlie Theron for being a beautiful woman uglifying herself up for this role. Hollywood as well as the general public has put Charlie Theron in such a corner in terms of her as an actress because of her model looks that it is so undeserving. Charlie can act and not because of her looks either.When I saw the film, what I saw was a gripping, raw portrayal of a woman who was psychologically damaged, so damaged she was beyond help. I would have liked a little more insight into Aileen's personal life and what drove her into such an uncontrollabal fury towards men. At least I was given what was a brief glimpse into the pain that led Aileen to murder several men. Of course what Aileen done was inexcusable and she should not be lumped as a victim like the men she killed. However I do believe that the events in Charlie's life did have an effect on the choices she made in life which includes murdering seven men. Charlie Theron as Aileen Wournos was utterly convincing, not just for the makeup that was provided by makeup artist Toni G. but for her abilities to tap into the soul of what most people consider a monster. A writer for ""Premier"" magazine wrote that he thought the film ""valorizes"" Aileen Wournos (in other words was a bit too biased) and too a certain extent I will agree with that writer because I left the theater feeling rather sympathetic towards Aileen Wournos. Still I know what she did was wrong and should be held accountable for her actions. Up until this film, I never really took Charlie Theron seriously as an actress. Just look at her body of film work. If Charlie continues to pick film roles (Oscar worthy or not) that showcases her broad range in acting abilities, I think she will be around for a long time (which I can't say the same for Mira Sorvino, Hilary Swank, and Marissa Tomei, past Oscar winners for best actress). Christina Ricci was equally good as Aileen's lover Selby Walls. I thought her more subdued performance should have been recognized by both the Golden Globes Awards as well as the Academy Awards. Christina took giant leap of faith to portray Selby Walls, who was easily manipulated and controlled by Aileen as well as her family. Selby was very passive and insecure. ""Monster"" is certainly not for the faint of heart or for people uncomfortable with the subject of homosexuality. There were some really raw, brutual scenes that even made me uncomfortable to watch but the film was so engaging because of the script and the actors involved, I simply let it go. I loved ""Monster"".

Charlize Theron's portrayal is such a revelation that any lapses in truth or artistry in the storytelling are inconsequential. I saw this film early in its release, and my first reaction was that if this girl didn't receive an Oscar (for whatever it's worth), then they (The Oscars) really are a sham. Not that the story isn't well told and directed. It's just that Theron's portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuernos is so overpowering to the viewer that it IS the film. I had never caught more than a glimpse of Miss Theron, who seemed an intelligent but generically gorgeous blonde. I was surprised as anyone that she created one of the best performances ever captured on film. It is a performance that is much, much more than a weight gain by an actress and prosthetics. It is eerie in its ability to transpose one from the fiction of moviemaking... she IS Aileen Wuernos. And, while Christina Ricci and the other supporting players are effective in their roles, they are merely small planets in  Theron's orbit, and, totally eclipsed by her. As I have lived in Florida for many years, I was well aware of the carnage that Wuernos inflicted, and her well publicized lack of remorse. Her attitude and repulsive appearance brought forth little compassion. I also recall the twisted public jubilation at her execution, and though I had no sympathy for her actions, I was overwhelmed with the feeling of wasted life. After seeing this film, I still can't excuse the results of her actions. But, the feeling of a life wasted is more overpowering than ever, Theron so effectively portrays her wretched exhistance. Of a life totally devoid of any love, stability, or nurturing. That the little girl who grew up in the shadow of the ""Monster"", the carnival ride which loomed dark and evil over her in childhood, turned out to be viewed as a monster herself seemed inevitable and pitiable. Let's face it, the superlatives used to laud most acting performances almost always turn out to be nothing more than hype. Above and beyond that, there are a handfull of very good performances every year. Then, rarely, there is a performance that goes way beyond that, in its ability to take the viewer out of the reality of the fact that you are sitting and watching a film, it so totally involves you. It becomes worthy of being referred to as ""art."" This is one of those films, and it is due to Charlize Theron's performence alone. Whether she ever succeeds in ""topping"" her performence here is unlikely and incidental. Every once in a great while, something is ""touched by God"" to make a small and perfect creation.

It is about a woman named  Aileen Wuornos who was a prostitue, and winds up committing several murders (note that I did not refer to her as a serial killer). What makes this story different though, is the road that takes her there. This movie illicited a response from me that I had not expected which was a tremendous amount of sympathy and pity. Her life started out incredibly difficult, and only got worse. Unlike the other notables (John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, et al) in my opinion she was not crazy and was more or less driven to do what she did. The first murder that she committed was a &quot;John&quot; that was brutally raping her, and had planned on killing her. That was the one that opened the flood gates of rage. The rest were the product of a lifetime of abuse from, and hatred of all of the other &quot;Johns&quot; previous. Only one that I saw could be considered oppertunistic, and towards the end she actually has difficulty killing one of her last victims. If you had never heard of Aileen Wuornos before, this one will make you never forget her name.Along those same lines, Charlize Theron's performance was easily the best in her career, and she will likely be immortalized for her protrayal - and rightly so. While normally a incredibly beautiful bombshell, she had to gain thirty pounds, and go through an amazing transformation with only make up. The only prosthetics were used were fake teeth. She winds up looking nothing like herself, which makes it very easy to forget that it's really her.Coming from a guy who owns more than 500 titles, I consider this to be one of the best that I own.

She so drowned herself in this character that she literally had ""breakdown moments"" on the set during filming (see this on the featurette with great behind the scenes coverage with director and costars)  She notes that every film has their 2 or 3 ""hard"" scenes to film, but this entire picture was a hard scene.The knowledge that it's based on a true story makes you pay more attention to the details, to the history behind Aileen's sad life the reasons she hated men, the disdain she held for her family, in particular her dad.Christina Ricci's portrayal of lesbian lover, Selby Wall, is wonderful, however, it bothered me to see how she provided the straw that broke the camel's back with Aileen.  Had Selby been self-sufficient and truly loved Aileen, she would not have demanded so much money for silly things; at one point in the film she comes home from an afternoon of drinking in the bar, loaded with ""groceries"" that she said they needed, however, Aileens checks the packages and pulls out a stuffed animal!She wanted to travel, go to Fun World - an amusement park, and basically live off of Aileen's money.  Selby was childish and immature, had only half a conscience, and this is the shame of the story, since Aileen looked to her as the savior that rescued her from suicide, and gave her something to dream of and hope for...a better, normal life.  In the end, Selby betrays Aileen, the killer takes full blame for her brutal actions and Selby disappears free and clear of any blame.The murder scenes, in particular one that is completely senseless and gut-wrenching, are enough to make you lose sleep at night.  This film haunted me for some time after viewing it, and though my heart went out to the abused and lost child that once was Aileen Wouronos, I cannot agree that her messed up early life was the reason for her choice of prostitution and murder as a way of living.  Her heartbreaking childhood couldn't be changed, but the roads she took in later years led to deeper trouble, and ultimately to her execution in prison in October, 2002.The true sadness of this woman's life and death is that had the right people reached out to her, things could have been better.",5,Terrifying and Heartwrenching,1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,2446,"['Having', 'seen', 'HBO', 'specials', 'real', 'life', 'Aileen', 'hearing', 'how', 'Charliz', 'Theron', 'transformed', 'play', 'part', 'Oscar', 'applaudes', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'film.I', 'was', 'riveted', 'place', 'absolutely', 'spellbound', 'Theron', 'performance', 'so', 'drowned', 'character', 'literally', 'had', 'breakdown', 'moments', 'set', 'filming', 'see', 'featurette', 'great', 'scenes', 'coverage', 'director', 'costars', 'film', '2', '3', 'hard', 'scenes', 'film', 'entire', 'picture', 'was', 'hard', 'scene.The', 'knowledge', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'details', 'history', 'Aileen', 'sad', 'life', 'reasons', 'hated', 'men', 'disdain', 'held', 'family', 'particular', 'dad.Christina', 'Ricci', 'portrayal', 'lesbian', 'lover', 'Selby', 'Wall', 'wonderful', 'however', 'bothered', 'see', 'how', 'provided', 'straw', 'broke', 'camel', 'back', 'Aileen', 'Had', 'Selby', 'been', 'self-sufficient', 'truly', 'loved', 'Aileen', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'demanded', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'silly', 'things', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'home', 'afternoon', 'drinking', 'bar', 'loaded', 'groceries', 'said', 'needed', 'however', 'Aileens', 'packages', 'out', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'wanted', 'travel', 'go', 'Fun', 'World', 'amusement', 'park', 'basically', 'live', 'Aileen', 'money', 'Selby', 'was', 'childish', 'immature', 'had', 'only', 'conscience', 'shame', 'story', 'Aileen', 'looked', 'savior', 'rescued', 'suicide', 'gave', 'something', 'dream', 'hope', 'better', 'normal', 'life', 'end', 'Selby', 'Aileen', 'killer', 'full', 'blame', 'brutal', 'actions', 'Selby', 'disappears', 'free', 'clear', 'blame.The', 'murder', 'scenes', 'particular', 'one', 'completely', 'senseless', 'gut-wrenching', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'lose', 'sleep', 'night', 'film', 'haunted', 'time', 'viewing', 'heart', 'went', 'abused', 'lost', 'child', 'once', 'was', 'Aileen', 'Wouronos', 'can', 'not', 'agree', 'messed', 'up', 'early', 'life', 'was', 'reason', 'choice', 'prostitution', 'murder', 'way', 'living', 'heartbreaking', 'childhood', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'changed', 'roads', 'took', 'later', 'years', 'led', 'deeper', 'trouble', 'ultimately', 'execution', 'prison', 'October', '2002.The', 'true', 'sadness', 'woman', 'life', 'death', 'had', 'right', 'people', 'reached', 'out', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better']",Monster

622492,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005JMUK,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[5, 6]","In 1992 Aileen Wuornos (1956-2002) stood trial for the murder of Richard Mallory in Florida.  Clearly dangerous and disturbed, Wuornos was an extremely belligerent, aggressive personality, and her frequent outbursts and several bizarre circumstances turned the trial into a media circus.  Convicted of Mallory's death, Wuornos also confessed to the murders of six others and remains a suspect in at least two unsolved homicides.  She was executed in 2002.But for all the drama of the 1992 trial, MONSTER sidesteps this aspect of the Wuornos story.  It instead focuses on Wuornos herself and her relationship with lover Selby (in real life Tyria J. Moore, the name change likely due to legal issues.)  And while it plays fast and loose with the facts--particularly re the Selby character--it offers a relentlessly fearsome portrait of an incredibly damaged woman whose rage twists into a vicious killing spree.Charlize Theron, previously better known for good looks than  acting skill, gives an inspired performance as Wuornos, seeming to inhabit the character; it is truly frightening to watch her.  Although the script's Selby is hardly in the same league with real-life Tyria J. Moore, Ricci too is quite fine--a mixture of innocence and soullessness that is often quite as disturbing as Theron's more flamboyant performance.  The supporting cast is also very good, with Bruce Dern notable as a biker friend and Scott Wilson particularly memorable as Wuornos' final victim.When I recently saw the film in theatrical release I found quite a few audience members walked out on the film in disgust.  And for all the power of the performances and the great artistry of the film, this is likely to be a real issue for any one who sees MONSTER.  The film does an extraordinary job of making us see Wuornos and Selby as human beings--and as pitiful human beings whose lives were largely warped and twisted by circumstance rather than personal choice.  Even so, both characters are dangerous, mean, manipulative, and vicious in different ways, and our pity for them will not stretch far enough to cover that.In the final analysis, I do recommend the film.  But before you rush to see it simply because it picked up a well-deserved Academy Award for Theron, you might do well to ask yourself: do I really want to know these people?  And if you are unsure, you'd probably do better to give it a miss--for you might well be one of the people walking out midway through.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,Brilliant Performances Highlight Disturbing Film,1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,2480,"['1992', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', '1956-2002', 'stood', 'trial', 'murder', 'Richard', 'Mallory', 'Florida', 'Clearly', 'dangerous', 'disturbed', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'extremely', 'belligerent', 'aggressive', 'personality', 'frequent', 'outbursts', 'several', 'bizarre', 'circumstances', 'turned', 'trial', 'media', 'circus', 'Convicted', 'Mallory', 'death', 'Wuornos', 'also', 'confessed', 'murders', 'six', 'others', 'suspect', 'least', 'two', 'unsolved', 'homicides', 'was', 'executed', '2002.But', 'drama', '1992', 'trial', 'MONSTER', 'aspect', 'Wuornos', 'story', 'instead', 'Wuornos', 'relationship', 'lover', 'Selby', 'real', 'life', 'Tyria', 'J.', 'Moore', 'name', 'change', 'likely', 'due', 'legal', 'issues', 'fast', 'loose', 'facts', 'particularly', 're', 'Selby', 'character', 'relentlessly', 'fearsome', 'portrait', 'incredibly', 'damaged', 'woman', 'rage', 'vicious', 'killing', 'spree.Charlize', 'Theron', 'previously', 'better', 'known', 'good', 'looks', 'acting', 'skill', 'inspired', 'performance', 'Wuornos', 'seeming', 'inhabit', 'character', 'truly', 'frightening', 'watch', 'script', 'Selby', 'hardly', 'same', 'league', 'real-life', 'Tyria', 'J.', 'Moore', 'Ricci', 'too', 'quite', 'fine', 'mixture', 'innocence', 'soullessness', 'often', 'quite', 'as', 'disturbing', 'Theron', 'more', 'flamboyant', 'performance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'notable', 'biker', 'friend', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'Wuornos', 'final', 'victim.When', 'recently', 'saw', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', 'found', 'quite', 'few', 'audience', 'members', 'walked', 'out', 'film', 'disgust', 'power', 'performances', 'great', 'artistry', 'film', 'likely', 'be', 'real', 'issue', 'one', 'who', 'MONSTER', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'job', 'making', 'see', 'Wuornos', 'Selby', 'human', 'beings', 'pitiful', 'human', 'beings', 'lives', 'were', 'largely', 'warped', 'twisted', 'circumstance', 'rather', 'personal', 'choice', 'Even', 'so', 'characters', 'are', 'dangerous', 'mean', 'manipulative', 'vicious', 'different', 'ways', 'pity', 'will', 'not', 'stretch', 'far', 'enough', 'cover', 'that.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'rush', 'see', 'simply', 'picked', 'up', 'well-deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Theron', 'might', 'do', 'well', 'ask', 'do', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'unsure', ""'d"", 'probably', 'do', 'better', 'give', 'miss', 'might', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'people', 'walking', 'out', 'midway', 'through.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Monster

But now that the movie is on DVD and is available for viewing in the sanctity and privacy of the home, the real treasure of what Director Patty Jenkins has achieved comes home.  Aileen Wournos was a killer of her johns, yes, but seeing this biography on the small screen reveals more of the motivation that drove her to commit such acts.  Patty Jenkins has entrusted Charlize Theron with the power to explore Wournos' mind, and between the two of them we discover that the mental state of this killer was shaped by her childhood and her actual experiences while plying her business on the freeways.  She was an abused soul, not that that forgives her crimes, but that it makes them credibly motivated.  Christina Ricci as her lesbian lover Selby follows suit in holding the mood and motivation of this doomed woman.  An additional feature on the DVD is an excellent 'featurette' in which Patty Jenkins, Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci interact to explain how the film was made and why was such an exhausting mission for the entire company.

622497,A3G3DN6ODH3RXR,B00005JMUK,Graham V. Foy,"[3, 4]","What I've been pretty surprised by when I hear this movie being discussed is the fact that most people point immediately to the performance by Charlize Theron, saying that it's almost as if you're not watching an actress but the real person she's playing. My confusion is first of all that I can't help thinking: isn't a good acting job contingent on a number of things? Like the dynamic between the characters?My problem with this movie is that there just isn't enough real interaction between the protagonist and Selby to make it seem as if we really AREN'T just watching two actors in front of a camera. Perhaps this stems from the problem of trying to fashion characters who were real people and whose history the writers of this film must have been familiar with. I'm sorry but the characters just don't seem to have any free will of their own. I was disappointed with what they ""did"" with this story: it's such an unlikely romance that exists between the two main characters, singularly beautiful, but I don't believe the unique nature of their relationship is ever really adequately illustrated for us. It's as if they wanted to make these characters more likeable or even more believeable by domesticating them, but forgot that the movie isn't ABOUT an everyday person, it IS about a societal ""monster"". There seems to be chemistry between the two main characters, but an almost ""professional"" kind that only exists between actors. And as far as Charlize Theron's performance, sorry again: she's just not a very nuanced character and aside from the nuisance of the makeup, ANYone could have played this role as well as her.Now, since this IS a five-star review I need to backtrack a little. I give this movie five stars because it has more than a few ""moments"". Some of it, in fact, borders on amazing. I won't describe specific scenes, I'll only say that the director managed to make a movie that is shocking, heartbreaking, even comical at times, and which still manages not to ""preach"" as one might expect it to. I would say, Whether you think you're going to enjoy this or not, watch it.

622498,AQZIM4XNOT9YI,B00005JMUK,Heartland G,"[1, 1]","I think Wournos had a little Anne Heche syndrome which a surprising amount of women rebels and lesbians seem to conveniently get. Mental illness, threats, extreme, strange abuses.... did you know that male supremacist secret societies like Christian secret groups, white supremacists, the mob, freemasons, millionaires boys clubs and other groups practice psyche warfare and certain women seem to be getting these troubles more than others. At one point in the documentary (not this movie) she says they are using sonic pressure on her ears. The government and other psyche warfare groups actually do use techniques like this in hostage situations etc... and the CIA have done experiments with these and other techniques to manipulate people mentally. We are living in fascist country and she could well have been being driven mad. Some of these techniques are very focused and subversive, so if you are a target, getting proof or convincing others to believe you will be hard.Wournos reminds me of John Brown of Bleeding Kansas fame, she mentions that people kill for all sorts of reasons - religions (usually male supremacists and anti-women's freedom religions) wars over resources etc... but you kill in defense of a woman's body and freedom, you get thrown in the crucifixion machine (lying media, court system, death system.) If you're against religions that practice child sacrifice and torture (Christianity especially) against animal abuse or the slavery of women you are shut down or shut up. Wuornos knew what happens, many of us are threatened, raped, tortured or killed. Watch the Stoning of Soraya M. and know that we are already living that reality in this country. Men define our morality (and it usually has something to do with being their slaves or ""subject in all things"" as per the bible) and then brutalize us for defying it. Secret male supremacist groups rule our lives in this so-called ""free"" country. Your right to vote is an illusion. Defy the male rule society and you stand a good chance of going mad, being conveniently afflicted with ""stressors"" psyche warfare style (lose the job, relationship, family, death in the family or friends. pets, using children or pets as hostages and threats)-  the networks of white and/or male supremacists do these things. White supremacists have openly stated they're using women to breed for their armies having many children per family. Male supremacists are doing this also and brain controlling children from a young age for breeders and slaves. Free speech is often a lie, many of us have trouble getting our message out there. You must stand up and fight back. The word is they are selling San Fran as the city of joy for homosexuals and then plan on destroying it. Do not gather in large numbers in one place, disperse yourself throughout the nation in groups large and small. If you are black or any race, do not gather in large numbers in one city. Homosexuals same thing. White supremacists are targeting you as are Christian fascists. If you gather in very large numbers you are in danger of being exterminated.This movie portrays her as grotesque and clueless as the people attacking her would like. I bet she wasn't. In high stress the first thing to go is your mind and hygiene, not high on your list of priorities when being assaulted continually, which is why people in the know often end up crazy and on the streets talking about conspiracy theories (which have a lot of basis in reality). Do not believe psyche and image warfare. Aileen was a possible feminist folk hero to me and she was discredited because of the damage done to her mind, which is a common trick.

622499,A1YJ2M23KYI2X7,B00005JMUK,"Hernando DeSoto ""Hernando""","[0, 0]","This movie is now part of my home library. I even bought another copy on Blu-Ray, that's how good it is. The direction and prodution values are as good as I have ever seen as are the performances by Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci.Here's the problem. Exactly how truthful IS this movie?Charlize Theron is a tall blond woman and, made up to look neglected and dissipated, she certainly looks like Aileen. Video recordings of the real Wournos will show you how good Charlize's physical and vocal impersonation is. It's damn near perfect.From that point on, the movie takes us in a different direction. Aileen's lover. Selby, is played by Christina Ricci, one of the best of our young screen actresses. Christina probably could not be upstaged by a monster if she were playing opposite Godzilla himself. That's how good an actress she is. Christina is petite and pretty. Aileen's real-life lover, Tyra, is a large, homely, masculine looking woman with broken teeth and bad skin. She's not the type of woman who elicits sympathy from an audience the way that this artificial Selby can do.The movie continues to take liberties as Aileen begins her career as a serial murduress. Aileen's first victim (played by Lee Tergeson of OZ), is a violent woman-hating rapist who beats, sodomizes, rapes and almost kills her. She shoots him in defense of her life. You will want to applaud.From there, the story meanders into audience manipulation with each victim a little more sympathetic than the one before him and Aileen now on a path of no return.The men that Aileen encounters, even while not ""plying her trade"" are insensitive dirtbags including a cop who forces her to perform oral sex in order to avoid arrest and, in the film's most unbelievable scene, a prospective employer who insults and degrades her during the job interview. The truth is, Aileen would have been screened out long before the interview. Except for her lover Selby, Aileen is alone.Aileen's final victim is a sympathetic middle-aged grandfather who only wants to help her out of trouble, offering to take her home to his wife and let her use the spare bedroom.Now see here! The only people who know what happened on the nights of the murders are Aileen and five dead men! Aileen says she was raped but who is there to contradict or support her story?And, how about Aileen's marriage to a much older man with a little money of his own? Aileen beat him repeatedly, until he filed for divorce. This little detail is conveniently left out of the movie.All this does not negate the fact that this is an excellent movie. It is a great movie and you should see it, but see at least one of the documentaries as well, just to keep things in perspective.If the title hadn't already been taken, i would have called this movie, this story, An American Tragedy.Obviously, Aileen had a very sad history of neglect and abuse that was never dealt with properly by society.So, you start out feeling pity for Aileen as someone who has fallen through the cracks of society and cannot pull herself out of her tailspin.

Welsh ""starmer welshmeister""","[1, 1]","Let it be known that this column will not serve as a pro/con platform to such popular debates as capital punishment or judiciary bias toward homosexuality and prostitution, all three of which are readily apparent in the film ""Monster."" Furthermore, neither will this review compare the events seen in the film to those documented in reality, nor will it address Aileen Wuornos' plea that her homicidal deeds were in self-defense.Instead, the purpose of this piece is to praise the impeccable transformation of a South African model into America's most infamous female serial killer, Aileen Carol Wuornos. It's a performance so stunning that your humble critic trembled on more than one occasion during the film.Prior to ""Monster,"" Charlize Theron was relatively unknown. Her roles were never daring or eye-popping. In fact, perhaps her most memorable part was that of the charming Candy Kendall alongside Tobey Maguire in John Irving's ""The Cider House Rules."" Besides that, leading roles in such critically lambasted motion pictures as ""Reindeer Games"" and ""The Astronaut's Wife"" had partially tainted Theron's acting r&eacute;sum&eacute;. What's more, the longer Theron hung on to her glamorous sex appeal, the longer critics would disavow recognition of any real talent.It wasn't until ""Monster"" writer-director Patty Jenkins approached Theron with the assignment of portraying the freshly executed mass murderer Wuornos that Theron saw an opportunity to acquire earnest critical appraisal.Theron has said that when she accepted Jenkins' proposal to play Wuornos she wasn't fully aware of the physical demands. She didn't have the faintest clue as to how drastic the metamorphosis would be, because she wasn't familiar with Wuornos. Rather, she took the role to see how far she could push herself. Theron went on to admit that the task was as daunting as any she'd tackled.By poring over dozens of death-row letters and studying news footage of Wuornos, Theron was able to duplicate her masculine mannerisms and vile thought processes.In an interview, Theron relayed the secret to internalizing Wuornos. Theron stated that though she thought her character study stemmed from the outside in, it was, in fact, completely the opposite. It wasn't until Theron began to conduct serious research that all the physical aspects of Wuornos revealed themselves.As good as the characterization might be, Theron required a makeover and serious weight gain to complete the transformation. With the assistance of renowned makeup artist Toni G, Theron's silky locks were reduced to Frankenstein's Bride status. Her faultless teeth became tobacco-stained and crooked. Her gorgeous turquoise eyes were made a soulless black, and her eyebrows were plucked to oblivion.Like Nicole Kidman before her, who donned a prosthetic nose and an incredibly chapped upper lip for her depiction of Virginia Woolf in ""The Hours,"" Theron's metamorphosis is worthy of the golden statuette for Best Actress.",3,Theron's acting is no monstrosity,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2975,"['Let', 'be', 'known', 'column', 'will', 'not', 'serve', 'pro/con', 'platform', 'such', 'popular', 'debates', 'capital', 'punishment', 'judiciary', 'bias', 'homosexuality', 'prostitution', 'three', 'are', 'readily', 'apparent', 'film', 'Monster', 'Furthermore', 'will', 'review', 'compare', 'events', 'seen', 'film', 'documented', 'reality', 'will', 'address', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'plea', 'homicidal', 'deeds', 'were', 'self-defense.Instead', 'purpose', 'piece', 'praise', 'impeccable', 'transformation', 'South', 'African', 'model', 'America', 'most', 'infamous', 'female', 'serial', 'killer', 'Aileen', 'Carol', 'Wuornos', 'performance', 'so', 'stunning', 'humble', 'critic', 'trembled', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'film.Prior', 'Monster', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'was', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'roles', 'were', 'never', 'daring', 'eye-popping', 'fact', 'perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'was', 'charming', 'Candy', 'Kendall', 'alongside', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'John', 'Irving', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'leading', 'roles', 'such', 'critically', 'lambasted', 'motion', 'Reindeer', 'Games', 'Astronaut', 'Wife', 'had', 'partially', 'tainted', 'Theron', 'acting', 'r', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'What', 'more', 'longer', 'Theron', 'hung', 'glamorous', 'sex', 'appeal', 'longer', 'critics', 'would', 'disavow', 'recognition', 'real', 'talent.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'Monster', 'writer-director', 'Patty', 'Jenkins', 'approached', 'Theron', 'assignment', 'portraying', 'freshly', 'executed', 'mass', 'murderer', 'Wuornos', 'Theron', 'saw', 'opportunity', 'acquire', 'earnest', 'critical', 'appraisal.Theron', 'said', 'when', 'accepted', 'Jenkins', 'proposal', 'play', 'Wuornos', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'aware', 'physical', 'demands', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'faintest', 'clue', 'how', 'drastic', 'metamorphosis', 'would', 'be', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Wuornos', 'Rather', 'took', 'role', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'could', 'push', 'Theron', 'went', 'admit', 'task', 'was', 'as', 'daunting', ""'d"", 'tackled.By', 'poring', 'dozens', 'death-row', 'letters', 'studying', 'news', 'footage', 'Wuornos', 'Theron', 'was', 'able', 'duplicate', 'masculine', 'mannerisms', 'vile', 'thought', 'interview', 'Theron', 'relayed', 'secret', 'internalizing', 'Wuornos', 'Theron', 'stated', 'thought', 'character', 'study', 'stemmed', 'outside', 'was', 'fact', 'completely', 'opposite', 'was', ""n't"", 'Theron', 'began', 'conduct', 'serious', 'research', 'physical', 'aspects', 'Wuornos', 'revealed', 'themselves.As', 'good', 'characterization', 'might', 'be', 'Theron', 'required', 'makeover', 'serious', 'weight', 'gain', 'complete', 'transformation', 'assistance', 'renowned', 'makeup', 'artist', 'Toni', 'G', 'Theron', 'silky', 'locks', 'were', 'reduced', 'Frankenstein', 'Bride', 'status', 'faultless', 'teeth', 'became', 'tobacco-stained', 'crooked', 'gorgeous', 'turquoise', 'eyes', 'were', 'made', 'soulless', 'black', 'eyebrows', 'were', 'plucked', 'oblivion.Like', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'donned', 'prosthetic', 'nose', 'incredibly', 'chapped', 'upper', 'lip', 'depiction', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Hours', 'Theron', 'metamorphosis', 'worthy', 'golden', 'statuette', 'Best', 'Actress']",Monster

Aileen Wuornos was a sad and pathetic creature whose past made her into what she became and Charlize Theron brings every complex dimension of her completely to life again in this film.  It wasn't just the makeup and added pounds that made Theron into Wuornos but her uncannily accurate portrayal of the woman who was lost between the horror of her personal life and the dreams she had to be somebody more than her circumstances dictated. Theron almost seems to be inhabited by the soul of Aileen Wuornos with every word, body movement and tormented and crazed wide-eyed look.  Her performance certainly deserved the Best Actress Oscar for this role and possibly of the decade. The music by BT adds another suitably eerie dimension to the film but it is really Theron's performance of the wonderful screenplay that makes this a 5-star film.There's really not any gore to speak of, but the raw and bottom-line truth of Wuornos' life is what makes the story nearly unpalatable.

Yes, she does kill many people (all men) but when you consider how many men battered her and raped her all through her life, even as a child, it's no surprise she became so psychotic.And I don't think it's exactly fair that she got the death penalty. Surely it would have been best to help a woman who lived her entire existence in the dregs of society (which is surely to blame for sending her mad) than executing her.Focusing entirely on Lee instead of the police investigations following her (there is a TV movie from the mid-90s that does exactly this if you're more interested), we see her straggle from thinking about suicide, hooking up with lonely, naive Selby (Christina Ricci), killing in self-defense and finally killing for revenge/money.Charlize Theron completely vanishes as she brings her take on Lee (her full name is never mentioned in the film) to the screen. She sure deserved her Academy Award and Christina Ricca (who is very cute here) is also very good. However, for a lesbian couple I just didn't see any real feeling between them. It annoyed me how fast the film moved and there are not really many quiet moments for these two characters to bond in any way. Yes, they proclaim their love for each other but I just didn't see it. There was too much shouting and screaming.There are no surprises in the film, as we all know how it ends anyway. But some of Lee's killings are harsh, compelling and even ironic. The overall effect of the film isn't so long-lasting on me though.It's shot and lit like a TV movie and Lee's heavy judgment at the end of the film is played down. For a film that is slightly biased to her point of view it's annoying that her unfair trial and life are not exploited just a little bit more for us to gain a little extra insight into the making of a 'monster'.Keep a lookout for Kane Hodder as an undercover cop near the end.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound and some slight extras.",3,Sympathy for the devil,1091232000,"07 31, 2004",2004,2074,"['film', 'brutally', 'honest', 'Aileen', ""'Lee"", 'Wuornos', 'crimes', 'provoke', 'sympathy', 'Yes', 'kill', 'many', 'people', 'men', 'when', 'consider', 'how', 'many', 'men', 'battered', 'raped', 'life', 'even', 'child', 'surprise', 'became', 'so', 'psychotic.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'exactly', 'fair', 'got', 'death', 'penalty', 'Surely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'help', 'woman', 'who', 'lived', 'entire', 'existence', 'dregs', 'society', 'surely', 'blame', 'sending', 'mad', 'executing', 'her.Focusing', 'entirely', 'Lee', 'instead', 'police', 'investigations', 'following', 'TV', 'movie', 'mid-90s', 'exactly', ""'re"", 'more', 'interested', 'see', 'straggle', 'thinking', 'suicide', 'hooking', 'up', 'lonely', 'naive', 'Selby', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'killing', 'self-defense', 'finally', 'killing', 'revenge/money.Charlize', 'Theron', 'completely', 'take', 'Lee', 'full', 'name', 'never', 'mentioned', 'film', 'screen', 'sure', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Christina', 'Ricca', 'who', 'very', 'cute', 'here', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'However', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'real', 'feeling', 'annoyed', 'how', 'fast', 'film', 'moved', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'many', 'quiet', 'moments', 'two', 'characters', 'bond', 'way', 'Yes', 'proclaim', 'love', 'other', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'shouting', 'are', 'surprises', 'film', 'know', 'how', 'anyway', 'Lee', 'killings', 'are', 'harsh', 'compelling', 'even', 'ironic', 'overall', 'effect', 'film', ""n't"", 'so', 'long-lasting', 'shot', 'lit', 'TV', 'movie', 'Lee', 'heavy', 'judgment', 'end', 'film', 'played', 'down', 'film', 'slightly', 'biased', 'point', 'view', 'annoying', 'unfair', 'trial', 'life', 'are', 'not', 'exploited', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'gain', 'little', 'extra', 'insight', 'making', ""'monster'.Keep"", 'lookout', 'Kane', 'Hodder', 'undercover', 'cop', 'end.The', 'DVD', '1.85:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'Dolby/DTS', '5.1', 'sound', 'slight', 'extras']",Monster

One of the best performances I have ever seen.  Chilling, desperate, woven through with a tender relationship with another woman, this tale - and the woman portrayed in the film - is devastating and compelling.  The physical presence of Theron's character is brilliant; this is an artist who transcends her own physical beauty, sacrificeses it by gaining weight for the ultimate reward: perfect characterization.  There is no trace of Theron left, only the high strung serial killer bent on living the life she longs for, while systematically ruining it with murder and prostitution. Ricci does a wonderful job as the unwitting ""lover"", and optimistically blinds herself to the dangerous aspects of Wuornos' out of control life. The random ugliness of prostitution is a stark contrast to the intimate and tender relationship between the two women; the violence bred into an abused woman is sad and terrifying to witness.

It allows us to think about the marginalized of our society and tries to make us understand what Aileen Wuornos went through in her life. Of particular importance is the absolutely terrific acting by Charlize Theron (for which she received Best Actress in this role) and Christina Ricci, who nearly steals the show. Before viewing, one should take a look on Wikipedia of the real story behind one of the nation's few women serial killers. And then, make a decision as to whether or not she should have been executed or not. In working with those deemed mentally ill as well as the marginalized, I have discovered they all have their own stories, some of which are just plain awful. Such is the case here. Other reviewers state with an air of ignorance and subtle racism that Wuornos should have approached social services in an attempt to wrestle with her demons in a safe manner and get some support, medication and resolution in a halfway house. I seriously doubt that Wuornos had the belief she could trust those agencies in light of the fact no one really understood her, or those demons she grappled so hard with. While it is true that as a prostitute one's daily life is always at risk, knows the dangers faced, and try to get something to eat to keep from starving to death. To care about persons such as what is depicted here knocks on the door of our capacity as humans to show some level of compassion, some level of maturity. That can be hard to do at times. Scenes where Theron faces potential employers are disturbing, as she gets angry and tells them off, rightly so in some respects. Bad behavior, indeed. On both sides. But practicing loving kindness is something not only lacking in Wuornos, but in those potential employers as well, and society as a whole. When you see this film, think about the true fact Wuornos was deemed Borderline Personality Disorder and Anti-Social Personality Disorder. Most of the time, personality disorders are difficult, if not impossible, to resolve, with or without medication, with or without therapy. Then, to be subjected to the criminal justice system in Florida is also difficult, and the subject's notoriety preceded her before she even had the remotest chance of a fair trial. When one deals with pathology of this magnitude, it is indeed, difficult to cast aside one's own prejudices in dealing with this population of the marginalized. The saving grace of Wuornos' legacy is that when one sees this film or reads about her life, perhaps compassion will find a way into one's life so that others may benefit. Movie Critic Roger Ebert at the time thought this the Best Film of the Year when it first came out. I would agree.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[70, 84]","Charlize Theron gives a five star+ performance as the executed serial killer Aileen Wuornos, the monster in &quot;Monster.&quot; I would have rated the movie the same, except it is just too filled with pain, desperation and hopelessness for me to rank it that high. The script is not particularly strong. We only get a glimpse into the life and mind of this woman, and we never discover what made her kill. Many abused women hate men, but they don't become serial killers. There is also a lot of repetition, as Wuornos goes through her pattern of solicitation, violence and anguish over and over again. Without Ms. Theron's magnificent acting the film would be rather mediocre.Director Patty Jenkins begins Wuornos' story in 1989-90, just before she was caught and imprisoned. She portrays Aileen more as a victim than as a victimizer. Through an initial monologue and various dialogues the viewer learns of Aileen's very troubled childhood in Michican. Her father, a convicted child-molester, committed suicide. Aileen was raped repeatedly by a family friend, and she began prostituting herself when she was thirteen. Her only job had been as a hooker. I think Ms. Theron portrays Aileen as a woman suffering from serious mental illness. Her moods swing from suicidal depression to euphoric overconfidence. She had delusional periods where she believed that all her dreams would come true and that she was invincible. She is a tough talking lady who drinks too much and barely holds her rage beneath the surface.It is during this period that she meets Selby (Christina Ricci is superb in this role.), a shy, naive teen, in a bar. Selby is a lesbian who wants to come out of the closet against her family's wishes. She is a misfit, without friends. So is Aileen. At first the two are so thrilled that they like each other - that they are not alone anymore. Their desperate, mutual quest for affection culminates in this doomed relationship. To me the relationship is more about loneliness and emotional dependency than physical attraction. The honeymoon is short-lived, however. Selby had never been on her own before and for some reason, doesn't think to get a job. She expects Aileen to provide for them. She manipulates Aileen into continuing to work as a prostitute, even though she is aware of at least one murder. Jenkins suggests that as long as the money keeps coming in she will ask no questions. Wuornos tries to get work and go straight but has no job skills or experience. She winds up going back on the road as a prostitute again, and then, after a violent episode with a john, her rage takes over and the murders begin.Charlize Theron does give an extraordinarily powerful performance as the serial killer. It is amazing how she was able to literally transform herself into a woman who looks exactly like the actual Aileen Wuornos, mannerisms and all. This transformation is not just make-up. She speaks like Wuornos, walks like her, with a masculine swagger, captures her intensity, and her eyes often hold a glint of madness.The film is shot in a gritty style on the highway, streets, bars and motel rooms. The ambiance is pure sleaze, reflecting the true crime drama. Overall, the story is fascinating, as is the point of view. And, as I have said, the performances are simply excellent.

622510,A140XH16IKR4B0,B00005JMUK,Jean E. Pouliot,"[4, 5]","The centerpiece of this film is Charlize Theron's stunning portrayal of Aileen Wuornos -- a Florida prostitute who murdered 7 murders in 1990 - thus becoming America's first female serial killer. Theron's transformation from Hollywood beauty to forty-something burned-out highway hooker occurs inside and out. While makeup can depict weather-battered skin, and a few extra pounds can take the bloom off the rose, Theron becomes alternatingly swaggering and pitiable, melting into the tottering psyche of Aileen. Her perpetually down-turned smile is both a mark of inner pride and an expression of the bravado that she needs to survive emotionally.As depicted in the movie, from a tender age Aileen craved for acceptance and love. The men in her life, from her abusive father to her schoolmates, only abuse her. The closest she comes to love is in letting men use her body in every degrading way imaginable. She prowls the highways, selling sexual favors for pitifully small amounts of cash. But after years of this degrading work, one trick turns violent and Aileen guns down her assailant. This seems to empower her in a way she has never experienced, and she continues to kill for money, partly to avoid hustling, partly to support her young paramour, and partly for revenge. It's not hard to see where this not-too-bright, friendless, alcoholic and unconnected person will end up.As seen in the DVD featurette, writer/director Patty Jenkins connects strongly with Aileen. Jenkins sees Aileen as a victim whose world has cut off every avenue of escape. Jenkins also sees in Aileen the desperate need of every human being to be loved. When Aileen meets Shelby (Christina Ricci) it seems that for the first time she has a chance to hope and dream of something better than hustling truckers and married men. Whether the film accurately portrays the true Aileen Wuornos is something I cannot answer. In fact, Jenkins's attempt to tell the ""larger truth"" about Aileen practically screams ""agenda-driven distortion!"" A larger truth than Jenkins's may be that when you make a film about people (including the men Aileen murdered) it is important to depict them fairly and accurately. Whether Jenkins did that, or just chose to take the word of a likely psychotic, drug-addicted, emotionally damaged woman is the big question. By choosing to ignore Aileen's drug problem (replacing it with excessive alcohol consumption) or her ever-shifting testimony about the murders provides an insight into Jenkins's possible agenda.Nevertheless, as a story of how a victimized human being whose last shred of self-respect comes exploding from the barrel of a gun, the movie is affecting and upsetting. As an unvarnished look at the humiliations and trials of the disposable people that some use for their gratification, it is troubling and moving. Viewers must ponder the question of the identity of the ""monster"" of the title. Is it Aileen, washed-up loser, prostitute and deranged serial killer? Or the men and communities that trampled her human dignity?

622512,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005JMUK,Jeffrey Leach,"[0, 1]","""Monster"" is the heartwarming story of one Aileen Wuornos, a rough and tumble gal who killed a bunch of guys in Florida back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Eventually the cops got wise to the fact that the person bumping these chaps off was probably one of the numerous harridans roaming the highways and byways looking for johns. The authorities eventually hauled in Wuornos and got a confession, tried her for capital murder, and executed her about three years ago. End of story. Well, not according to writer/director Patty Jenkins. She thought Wuornos's tale of woe would make for a great movie, and thus ""Monster"" arrived on the scene last year to great acclaim. Thanks in large part to the shocking metamorphosis of lead actress Charlize Theron, the movie grabbed a lot of attention in all corners. Moreover, the film is notable because someone in Hollywood managed to make a film about a social outcast that didn't cover the subject with retch-inducing sycophancy. There aren't any heroes in ""Monster,"" and while the picture tries to garner some sympathy for the despicable Wuornos, it never attempts to justify the horrible actions committed by this loathsome serial killer--at least not that much, anyway.One look at Aileen Wuornos ought to make any sane person head for the hills, but surprisingly many different types of guys pick her up on the side of the road. This works well for the woman since her appearance and rough manner virtually ensures that she can't find adequate employment anywhere else, at least not the sort of work that she could use to support herself. Indeed, one part of the film documents Wuornos's attempts to leave her ugly past behind in order to find a decent job only to find rejection awaits her at every stop. Anyway, her life suddenly takes on new meaning thanks to two major events. First, she meets a young woman with serious personal issues, Selby Wall (Christina Ricci), in a bar and the two strike up an odd relationship. Wuornos is just what this young girl is looking for, primarily an escape from the fundamentalist relatives her father sent her to after exhibiting questionable behavior up in Ohio. Second, Wuornos kills a john after the guy nearly kills her on an abandoned road. Needing to move on for a time to avoid potential problems with the police, Aileen eventually convinces Selby to tag along.The two move through a string of scuzzy hotels and run down shacks before settling in a fairly nice house. But there are problems, mainly Selby's need to meet people outside the relationship and her ever so subtle manipulations of Wuornos's frail ego. Afraid of losing Selby and with her absence the only sense of love she's ever felt in her life, Wuornos not only continues but also escalates her vicious rampages. She starts offing any of the patrons who pick her up even when it is clearly obvious they have no intention of physically harming her. Wuornos then sells off the men's cars for the cash needed to keep her girlfriend satisfied. It's really a sick relationship made even worse by the fact that Selby knows what's going on and refuses to put a stop to it. Oh, she goes through the motions, crying and screaming and asking her beloved ""Lee"" what is going on, but she always comes back for more. And why not? Every so often Wuornos shows up with a wad of cash and takes care of everything. That Selby will eventually turn on her lover when the cops come a knockin' should be a foregone conclusion.While I don't fully agree with others who have said that ""Monster"" overly sympathizes with its subject, there is evidence of such objectionable behavior in the script. We don't know what Aileen Wuornos really said or did when she killed her victims, so presenting her as crying and remorseful even as she drops the hammer on a victim is a bit of a stretch--especially when it's more than obvious that by this point she is killing solely to make money. But getting something out of the film doesn't really rely on agreeing or disagreeing with how Jenkins depicts her subject as much as it does on the amazing performance turned in by Charlize Theron. An incredibly beautiful woman by any standard, the actress undergoes an incredible transformation to play the pasty faced, obese Aileen Wuornos. She's got everything down, from the woman's voice to her posture and body language. If you don't believe such a thing possible, try and find a documentary or crime show on the real Wuornos and then watch the movie. It's quite remarkable, actually, and very disturbing as well. The only time I could tell I was looking at Theron occurred when she smiled, but other than that we might as well be staring into the late Aileen Wuornos's mug. Scary.The DVD comes with a few extras, primarily a couple of short featurettes explaining how Jenkins and Theron conducted research into the character and one outlining how the film score came about. No commentary track, surprisingly, but that will probably arrive when someone releases the collector's edition, super duper special feature two disc compilation delivered to your home by Theron herself wearing her Wuornos get up. I heartily recommend ""Monster,"" and would watch it again if given the chance. It reeks of nihilism, contains some of the finest acting I've seen this year, and deals with subject matter most filmgoers avoid like the plague.",4,See it for Theron,1113523200,"04 15,

622513,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00005JMUK,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[3, 3]","Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci star in this graphic and true story about Aileen Wuornos, an abused prostitute who was convicted of killing at least seven men in Florida.Theron stars as Wuornos, while Ricci stars as Selby, a young and extremely naive girl who becomes involved, both romantically and eventually on the run with Aileen.  Aileen met Selby in the midst of her spree, and after spending time with her, she begins to fall in love.  Due to these feelings she's developed, she longs to have a real life and a real relationship with Selby.  However, she can't stop the killing.  She kills for revenge for the years of abuse she suffered, and she also kills for money for herself and Selby to survive.  Most of her victims were married men.  Aileen tries to get a ""real"" job, but no one will hire her due to her lack of skills.  As her life continues to crumble, even Selby begins to question her.Eventually, Selby finds out what is really going on with Aileen, and she cooperates with the authorities to convict Aileen of multiple murder.  After being convicted and sentenced to die, Aileen Wuornos survived for twelve years on Death Row before finally being executed in October of 2002.  Aileen and Selby never spoke to each other after Aileen's trial.This is a very good movie.  Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos won her an Academy Award for best actress.  Christina Ricci's performance of the confused and easily-influenced Selby was excellent as well.  Be warned: the violence and language contained in this movie makes it suitable for mature audiences only.  I highly recommend this film.

It's one of those movies that leave you dead at the end.If there is one performance that will tear you up inside this film, it's Theron's. For the entire movie you can hardly believe that this is, in real life, beautiful women. Theron throws all the glamour out the window, gaining weight and frumping herself up to the point of being ugly. This is a complete 360 and she's so engrossing. She carries the film to heights. A lesser actress might turn in a wonderful performance, but Theron was Aileen. This is some great acting. Christina Ricci's portrayal of Shelby is equally remarkable, conveying childlike naivety, seductiveness, stubbornness and growing manipulative ness very well. They both dominate the film. The supporting performances did fine as well. I also give Kudos to Bruce Dern. His character has the distinction of being the only person who shows any real compassion for Aileen. While a small role it sticks out because it's the only real bit of bright light in an otherwise dark and gloomy picture.The screenplay by Patty Jenkins (Who also directed) does a great job of giving Aileen and those around her life. What Aileen did was reprehensible. The violence is not glorified--it's bloody and sick. What's so fascinating (and scary) about this film is that I actually began to sympathize with Wuornos! While I could never condone her actions you can see clearly what led her to it. This is a rare film--it makes a serial killer look sympathetic. What she did was evil, and she had to pay for that. Not all evil is dark and black, and not all people who murder are 100% culpable. But yet you reap what you sow no matter what you're past.MONSTER is a well-made film that's not for the weak of heart. It's also engaging, engrossing, and realistic. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. You won't learn too much about how Aileen Wournos turned into the person she did. Even the narrative itself is a little confusing at time, so that you can't be sure where Lee and Selby are at given moments. But it's Hollywood professionalism at one of its rare high points.

She filled them, all right, and then some, taking home the gold-plated proof last March.In the role first incarnated by alleged kleptomaniac and drug addict Wynyna Rydyr,  Christina Ricci almost ""steals the show"" while seemingly operating under massive doses of narcotics.  The scene where she almost starts to get upset about something will haunt this viewer for some time to come.  Likewise, the troll-like make-up effects created for Ricci's character are almost as stunning as the transformations wrought upon Theron, and should certainly have garnered Academy attention.Though most of the original ""Beetlejuice"" plot points have either been jettisoned or so transformed as to be unrecognizable, its ""exorcising living people from houses"" angle is neatly transposed to ""exorcising living johns from their cars, and then stealing the cars"".(Irony of ironies: the ""Monster"" of the title refers not to Aileen Wournos, but to an entirely SEPARATE fearsome, ramshackle amusement ride.)",5,"Theron superb in loose""Beetlejuice"" remake",1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,1282,"['Charlize', 'Theron', 'got', 'down', 'pat', 'foghorn', 'voice', 'wild', 'gesticulation', 'drunken', 'sailor', 'attempting', 'restore', 'circulation', 'four', 'limbs', 'once', 'proving', 'industry', 'nay-sayers', 'when', 'filling', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'shoes', 'most', 'shoe-fillingest', 'actresses', 'filled', 'all', 'right', 'then', 'taking', 'home', 'gold-plated', 'proof', 'last', 'March.In', 'role', 'first', 'incarnated', 'alleged', 'kleptomaniac', 'drug', 'addict', 'Wynyna', 'Rydyr', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'almost', 'steals', 'show', 'seemingly', 'operating', 'massive', 'doses', 'narcotics', 'scene', 'where', 'almost', 'get', 'upset', 'something', 'will', 'haunt', 'viewer', 'time', 'come', 'Likewise', 'troll-like', 'make-up', 'effects', 'created', 'Ricci', 'character', 'are', 'almost', 'as', 'stunning', 'transformations', 'wrought', 'Theron', 'should', 'certainly', 'have', 'garnered', 'Academy', 'most', 'original', 'Beetlejuice', 'plot', 'points', 'have', 'been', 'jettisoned', 'so', 'transformed', 'be', 'unrecognizable', 'exorcising', 'living', 'people', 'houses', 'angle', 'neatly', 'transposed', 'exorcising', 'living', 'johns', 'cars', 'then', 'stealing', 'cars', 'Irony', 'ironies', 'Monster', 'title', 'not', 'Aileen', 'Wournos', 'entirely', 'SEPARATE', 'fearsome', 'ramshackle', 'amusement', 'ride']",Monster
622519,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B00005JMUK,JGC,"[14, 16]","""Monster"" delves into the mind of the first female serial killer, Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron.) But it does not condone what she did or take sides. Instead, the film describes her life over the nine months after she found love with Selby (Christina Ricci); from 1989 to 1990. I really liked the narration/voiceover that Charlize did (as Aileen.) It lent a little credence to the movie and some humanity to Aileen, as well.Charlize Theron very rightfully won the Academy Award for her portrayal of Aileen Wuornos. Charlize completely metamorphosed her entire look which was so eerie and uncanny because it was impossible to tell that she was acting in a movie. She also changed the sound of her voice, sounding exactly like the women she played. Charlize is a true actress and very deserving of the Best Actress nod from the Academy. Christina Ricci was also excellent playing the shy and introverted Selby, and has proven herself to be a very accomplished cinema actress.The movie follows the tale of harried and hopeless Aileen Wuornos as she tries to pick up the pieces of her shattered and tattered life. When Aileen meets Selby it was almost love at first sight. Selby practically saved her life and for that Aileen was forever in her debt. I think my favorite scene was when they were together in the bed (that first night they met) and Selby asks Aileen if she could touch her face. Aileen seemed so sensitive and gentle.Besides that horrible rape scene and other depictions of degradation (I really hated that scene with that scumbag cop that picked her up after her job interview), I also found the scenes when Aileen tried to look for work very bitter. No one would give her a chance or listen to her. She had no money, no education, no family; absolutely nothing. All the doors were loudly slammed in her face. Society gladly threw Aileen Wuornos away. She was just another hooker, why did it matter that she wanted to clean up her act? Charlize was especially perfect during these parts. Her look of rage, and total desperation was purely obvious.Another aspect of this story that I found terribly sad was when Selby turned her back on Aileen. Aileen loved her more than her own life and she finally thought that she had a chance of happiness. Maybe Aileen also thought that she finally found a person that she could honestly trust. Maybe if Aileen never met Selby she would still be alive today?I really liked the way the movie ended. It wasn't too deep or sad, instead I found it very surreal because it wasn't too weighty. The movie ended the way it started, with Aileen narrating to the viewers in her own sarcastic and comical way.""Monster"" did make me feel sorry for Aileen because she was obviously an incredibly broken person that was never given a fighting chance. Someone please tell me why is Aileen vilified while these horrible men that raped her and sexually abused her aren't?

They have decided, like an overbearingly pompous mother, just what is good for us. Gone are the days of films like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Apostle, The Shawshank Redemption and other films that changed our movie habits forever. They do, however, have a newfound liking for films that empathize with characters caught in a nigthmarish hell and that seize our emotions and shatter them like glass. I'm sorry if I sound the part of a simpleton here, but nihilism is getting tiresome.In Monster, the empathy for a woman who, although having things done to her so heinous that I felt sick at the thought of the miscreants who hurt her, still seems to scream at us - in the films theme, that is - that it's not really her fault that she now kills people. It was the fault of the rapist who molested her at age of eight. It was the fault of the man who rapes her when she starts ""hooking."" It was the fault of society. It wasn't her fault when she takes an innocent man out to a field and shoots in in the back of the head.I hated when the film started to twist its ugly, but nowadays predictably thematic head. Another gem of a ""thinking"" film was at it again, bringing forth all its pretention and presumption along with it. The message, escorted handsomely by numerous awards for Therin and the film, told us, ""If you village dwellers don't grasp our statement here, you probably adore films like  The Wedding Planner and Racing Stripes.""WRONG!I got the theme and I almost puked all over myself.

622523,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JMUK,Joe Sherry,"[2, 2]","A film by Patty JenkinsRoger Ebert listed ""Monster"" as the best film of all of 2003.  Charlize Theron won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  For months before the Oscars the talk had been about how amazing Theron's performance was and how not only was it the best performance of the year, it was one of the best performances in years.  This is a lot of high praise that raised my expectations on exactly what it was that I was going to see in ""Monster"".""Monster"" is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos.  Aileen lived as a prostitute in Florida and became a serial murderer, killing her prospective clients.  As the film opens, Aileen is sitting under an overpass and is reflecting back on past events, specifically her meeting of Selby (Christina Ricci).  After meeting Selby in a bar, Selby quickly becomes Aileen's best (and only) friend and also her lover.  They are both very lonely and needy people.  For the love of Selby, Aileen wants to clean up her life, quit hooking, and find a real job so she can support Selby.  Unfortunately for Aileen, she is unable to find a job because she has no work experience, no resume, and a huge chip on her shoulder that prevents anyone in a position to help to even want to help her.  Selby is demanding, telling Aileen that she needs to start hooking again because they don't have any money, she is hungry, and this is one thing that Aileen can do to support her.When she is raped by one of her clients, Aileen finally snaps and kills him.  She tells Selby that this was a one time thing, but after this first murder she starts killing and robbing her other clients.  It is at this point where we start to see Aileen crack under the pressure of what her life has become.  She feels that from day one she never stood a chance.  She was sexually abused as a child and by age 13 was pregnant and a prostitute.  This is her life and she has no opportunity to improve her life.  Her experience trying to find a legitimate job is proof of this.  ""Monster"" is the story of Aileen Wuornos and it is brutal and unflinching.It is impossible to separate the performance of Charlize Theron from the rest of the movie.  ""Monster"" is built on the raw power and pain of Theron's transformation into Aileen Wuornos.  This transformation was both physical and emotional.  Charlize Theron is a strikingly beautiful woman and early in her career the roles she became known for were little more than the beautiful wife/girlfriend/woman (Legend of Bagger Vance, The Devil's Advocate, The Cider House Rules).  ""Monster"" required a physical change in the appearance of Theron's face and the make-up helped change the beautiful Theron into the ugly Wuornos.  The other part of the transformation is that Wuornos was a tormented, pained, and angry woman and this required Theron to not simply be a woman acting but rather to ""become"" Aileen Wuornos.  She succeeds.During the first half of the movie I could not figure out why Theron had won the Academy Award for Best Actress.  She had become Aileen, but the performance was nothing terribly impressive for the first fifty minutes.  But when Selby confronts Aileen to return to being a prostitute, that scene nailed it for me and brought Theron's performance to an entirely new level.  The raw emotion Theron conveyed carried the movie.  The performance became more emotional, angry, vulnerable, fearful, and edgy and at no point did I think that this was Theron acting.  I saw Aileen Wuornos.The movie itself, without Charlize Theron, did not feel to me that it was telling a story that could not have been told on a made for cable (because of the content) movie.  But the movie is not so much about the plot and about the story, but rather about the performance and transformation of Charlize Theron into Aileen Wuornos.  The performance makes the viewer capable of feeling pity for Aileen without excusing her actions.  I don't feel that there is any question that Theron deserved the Oscar for ""Monster"".-Joe Sherry",4,the performance of the year,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,4046,"['film', 'Patty', 'JenkinsRoger', 'Ebert', 'listed', 'Monster', 'best', 'film', '2003', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'portrayal', 'serial', 'killer', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'months', 'Oscars', 'talk', 'had', 'been', 'how', 'amazing', 'Theron', 'performance', 'was', 'how', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'best', 'performance', 'year', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'years', 'lot', 'high', 'praise', 'raised', 'expectations', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'Monster', 'Monster', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'Aileen', 'lived', 'prostitute', 'Florida', 'became', 'serial', 'murderer', 'killing', 'prospective', 'clients', 'film', 'Aileen', 'sitting', 'overpass', 'reflecting', 'back', 'past', 'events', 'specifically', 'meeting', 'Selby', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'meeting', 'Selby', 'bar', 'Selby', 'quickly', 'Aileen', 'best', 'only', 'friend', 'also', 'lover', 'are', 'very', 'lonely', 'needy', 'people', 'love', 'Selby', 'Aileen', 'clean', 'up', 'life', 'quit', 'hooking', 'find', 'real', 'job', 'can', 'support', 'Selby', 'Unfortunately', 'Aileen', 'unable', 'find', 'job', 'work', 'experience', 'resume', 'huge', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'anyone', 'position', 'help', 'even', 'want', 'help', 'Selby', 'demanding', 'telling', 'Aileen', 'start', 'hooking', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'hungry', 'one', 'thing', 'Aileen', 'can', 'do', 'support', 'her.When', 'raped', 'one', 'clients', 'Aileen', 'finally', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'thing', 'first', 'murder', 'killing', 'robbing', 'other', 'clients', 'point', 'where', 'start', 'see', 'Aileen', 'crack', 'pressure', 'what', 'life', 'become', 'day', 'one', 'never', 'stood', 'chance', 'was', 'sexually', 'abused', 'child', 'age', '13', 'was', 'pregnant', 'prostitute', 'life', 'opportunity', 'improve', 'life', 'experience', 'trying', 'find', 'legitimate', 'job', 'proof', 'Monster', 'story', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'brutal', 'unflinching.It', 'impossible', 'separate', 'performance', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'rest', 'movie', 'Monster', 'built', 'raw', 'power', 'pain', 'Theron', 'transformation', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'transformation', 'was', 'physical', 'emotional', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'early', 'career', 'roles', 'became', 'known', 'were', 'little', 'more', 'beautiful', 'wife/girlfriend/woman', 'Legend', 'Bagger', 'Vance', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'Monster', 'required', 'physical', 'change', 'appearance', 'Theron', 'face', 'make-up', 'helped', 'change', 'beautiful', 'Theron', 'ugly', 'Wuornos', 'other', 'part', 'transformation', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'tormented', 'pained', 'angry', 'woman', 'required', 'Theron', 'not', 'simply', 'be', 'woman', 'acting', 'rather', 'become', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'succeeds.During', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Theron', 'had', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'had', 'become', 'Aileen', 'performance', 'was', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'impressive', 'first', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'when', 'Selby', 'Aileen', 'return', 'being', 'prostitute', 'scene', 'nailed', 'brought', 'Theron', 'performance', 'entirely', 'new', 'level', 'raw', 'emotion', 'Theron', 'conveyed', 'carried', 'movie', 'performance', 'became', 'more', 'emotional', 'angry', 'vulnerable', 'fearful', 'edgy', 'point', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'Theron', 'acting', 'saw', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos.The', 'movie', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'telling', 'story', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'made', 'cable', 'content', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'story', 'rather', 'performance', 'transformation', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'performance', 'viewer', 'capable', 'feeling', 'pity', 'Aileen', 'excusing', 'actions', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'question', 'Theron', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Monster', '.-Joe', 'Sherry']",Monster

Morgan ""Light Coach""","[3, 5]","This movie is disturbing...incredibly disturbing...It is the story of serial killer Aileen Wuornos...but you knew that already. Aileen is used and abused all of her life and then she snaps and she starts her killing spree. Being a Spiritual Practitioner I encourage every one to take 100% complete and total responsibility for their lives and yet even though I encourage this, I know that some things are not so black and white. The sad fact is, that people do use us, they do abuse us, they do confuse us and sometimes we are walking a very thin line between sanity and insanity.Sometimes, it's a wonder how most of us have made it this far without snapping.I had a situation where I was involved with an abusive person. This person made me feel small, inadequate, and totally worthless. I was relatively young when a lot of this happened, but I can clearly remember going to bed one night swearing to myself that if this person didn't knock it off, one day they were going to be sorry.Fortunately, that person died before the rage within me completely boiled over. And yet even though this person had died, there was still this anger, this bitterness, this hardness that was growing over me that could have infected my entire world but instead of taking it out on others, I took it out on myself in various forms and dresses and it was only until I got a small glimpse that maybe I was worthy...maybe I was deserving...maybe I was good enough to have love and respect and appreciation for myself, that all of this hate, all of this bitterness, all of this rage dissolved from a true and honest willingness to forgive this person that had violated my psyche and not let them abuse me any more.I don't approve of what Aileen Wuornos did, but I also don't judge her. This truth is, that she was all too human and yes, her acts may have been considered ""monstrous"" and horrible, but were the acts that were done on her any less horrible? This movie will make you question your life right down to the marrow of your bones. I know that after watching this, I had several fitful nights of sleep, I was very troubled, and very upset. Who knows how my life would've been if somehow the power of Grace hadn't stepped in?We are all capable of being monsters, but the Truth is, the real Truth is, that we are much more capable of being angels. Aileen Wuornos is now an angel. She didn't go to hell. She was in hell while she was here and because God is a God of Love, God's Love redeemed her and gave her yet another opportunity to begin.This is what Grace is all about.Peace & Blessings",5,Who's To Blame?,1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,2577,"['movie', 'disturbing', 'incredibly', 'disturbing', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'knew', 'already', 'Aileen', 'used', 'abused', 'life', 'then', 'killing', 'spree', 'Being', 'Spiritual', 'Practitioner', 'encourage', 'one', 'take', '100', '%', 'complete', 'total', 'responsibility', 'lives', 'yet', 'even', 'encourage', 'know', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'black', 'white', 'sad', 'fact', 'people', 'do', 'use', 'do', 'abuse', 'do', 'confuse', 'sometimes', 'are', 'walking', 'very', 'thin', 'line', 'sanity', 'insanity.Sometimes', 'wonder', 'how', 'most', 'have', 'made', 'far', 'snapping.I', 'had', 'situation', 'where', 'was', 'involved', 'abusive', 'person', 'person', 'made', 'feel', 'small', 'inadequate', 'totally', 'worthless', 'was', 'relatively', 'young', 'when', 'lot', 'happened', 'can', 'clearly', 'remember', 'going', 'bed', 'one', 'night', 'swearing', 'myself', 'person', 'did', ""n't"", 'knock', 'off', 'one', 'day', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'sorry.Fortunately', 'person', 'died', 'rage', 'completely', 'boiled', 'over', 'yet', 'even', 'person', 'had', 'died', 'was', 'still', 'anger', 'bitterness', 'hardness', 'was', 'growing', 'could', 'have', 'infected', 'entire', 'world', 'instead', 'taking', 'out', 'others', 'took', 'out', 'various', 'forms', 'dresses', 'was', 'only', 'got', 'small', 'glimpse', 'maybe', 'was', 'worthy', 'maybe', 'was', 'deserving', 'maybe', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'have', 'love', 'respect', 'appreciation', 'hate', 'bitterness', 'rage', 'dissolved', 'true', 'honest', 'willingness', 'forgive', 'person', 'had', 'violated', 'psyche', 'not', 'let', 'abuse', 'more.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'approve', 'what', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'did', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'truth', 'was', 'too', 'human', 'yes', 'acts', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'monstrous', 'horrible', 'were', 'acts', 'were', 'done', 'less', 'horrible', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'question', 'life', 'right', 'down', 'marrow', 'bones', 'know', 'watching', 'had', 'several', 'fitful', 'nights', 'sleep', 'was', 'very', 'troubled', 'very', 'upset', 'Who', 'how', 'life', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'somehow', 'power', 'Grace', 'had', ""n't"", 'stepped', 'are', 'capable', 'being', 'monsters', 'Truth', 'real', 'Truth', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'capable', 'being', 'angels', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'now', 'angel', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'hell', 'was', 'hell', 'was', 'here', 'God', 'God', 'Love', 'God', 'Love', 'redeemed', 'gave', 'yet', 'opportunity', 'begin.This', 'what', 'Grace', 'about.Peace', 'Blessings']",Monster

One can feel bad for the horrible, nightmarish life Wournos had, while at the same time being perfectly comfortable with her paying the ultimate price for her hideous crimes.(There is something to be said for understanding what leads some people to murder. Frankly, I consider that knowledge a step toward treating the CAUSE rather than the symptom. In other words, if you can figure out what causes people to kill BEFORE they do it, it's better than simply waiting for some poor slob to get murdered and then dole out the punishment afterward. No, it'll never prevent ALL murders, but if it prevents a few it would be worth a study or two.)Anyway, ""Monster"" provides some of that insight. Theron does not simply act... she BECOMES Wournos.

It also shows a relationship she had at the time with a woman (Christina Ricci) and how the murders tore their relationship apart.Depressing. That is the first word that went into my head after I got up and left the cinema when I went to see this back in 2003. I also felt digust and had a sense of being dirty. In the car, I didn't speak about it to my companion that was feeling the same thing that I was. The film hits the mark dead on with the feelings and the emotions and the acting. When you are done with this movie, you walk out of it feeling ""Why did I see that?"" because it is one of the darkest stories I have ever seen told on the screen. It makes you feel bad. It just makes your skin crawl over. There is not a single bone in my body that was creeped out by what I had seen in that.Patty Jenkins, for a first time director, introduces nothing new to the film world. She has so-so direction that is highlighted by Theron's amazing transformation into Wuornos. The only way that a person can say they got something out of the film was to look at Theron's performance and say ""that is the only good thing, her performance."" The reason why the film was critically acclaimed was by her performance, and performance only. The performance was what set the film. You weren't watching the other actors take their turn. You were watching Theron in awe as she displays the sickening life of the murder that she was ask to portray. The writing itself was mediocre and was all over the place, it took Theron's character and developed her the most while leaving other characters with little or no development at all. Like I said, it was a star making vehicle for Charlize Theron like Risky Business was for Tom Cruise or The Hustler was for Paul Newman. The film focuses mostly on Theron and never lets up.Theron's performance was amazing, in a word. She takes the character and develops the mannerisms of the person and the personality also. She makes you hate and feel for her at the same time the development of the character shows towards the end of the film when Aileen looks back in desperation of getting a last glimpse of her lover.Overall, the film make me depressed, but I was in awe of Charlize's performance and was glad that she won the Oscar for it, because before this, she really hadn't impressed me with her other films as they hadn't any challenging roles that she could free herself in as a actress.

622531,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JMUK,Joseph Haschka,"[3, 7]","Whenever I suggest an acting performance worthy of an Oscar, it's understood that my recommendation is debatable. Not so Charlize Theron's tour de force in MONSTER, which transcends argumentative discussion. It's the performance of this decade, and perhaps any decade you'd care to mention. If it doesn't win her the Academy Award for best actress in a leading role, then there's no justice and the Oscars will forever lose all credibility with me. No other performance by a female actor in 2003 comes even close. Not Kidman, not Johansson, not Keaton, or anyone else you'd be tempted to mention. And I'll even sell down the river my personal favorite, Cate Blanchett.In January 1991, aging prostitute Aileen Wuornos was arrested in Florida. She was suspected of killing seven men since 1989, leaving their bullet-riddled bodies near highways, and stealing their cars and cash. In January 1992, Wuornos was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death, mostly on the evidence of her own confessions and the testimony of her lesbian lover during the killing spree, Tyria Moore. In October 2002, the state took her life. MONSTER is Aileen's story.Even a cursory reading of the Wuornos tragedy on the Web will indicate the challenge of Charlize's incredibly taxing role. It's not just the make-up (shaved eyebrows, false teeth), body alteration (thirty pounds added weight), and costumes that the actress put on for the role. It's the walk, talk, nervous mannerisms and body language. Even aura, if you believe in such. Theron is unrecognizable as herself. The transformation is apocalyptically stunning.The film does, of course, take liberties. Tyria Moore, 24-years old when she met Wuornos in 1986, becomes ""Selby"" (Christina Ricci), who's about 18 in the script. The screenplay inferred to me a time span of perhaps several months for the Aileen-Selby relationship, and that the first killing occurred about when the two first met. In fact, Aileen and Tyria spent four years together, and the first murder was committed only towards the end. In any case, Ricci deserves consideration for an Oscar in a supporting role as the troubled, naive, and clueless Selby totally out of her depth.At one point, Theron's Aileen states that she was raped by her father's friends, and that he subsequently beat her for it. In fact,  Aileen's real-life mother divorced Leo Dale Pittman a couple months before her daughter's birth and Aileen never met her natural father. Aileen and a brother were subsequently raised by their maternal grandparents, Lauri and Britta Wuornos. The grandfather drank heavily and was physically abusive. Aileen engaged in pre-marital sex at an early age, and was pregnant at 14. After giving her child up for adoption, she ran away from home to take up hitchhiking and prostitution. While MONSTER doesn't excuse Aileen for her the murders she later committed, it reveals Wuornos for the emotionally and psychologically tortured casualty of life that she was and who, in the end, ""volunteered"" for the death penalty. In this case, execution may have been a mercy.MONSTER gives evil a human face, a fact that will undoubtedly cause discomfiture in some critics who believe in a morally black and white world.MONSTER isn't an easy presentation to watch. As the film unwound and the power of Theron's performance washed over me in waves, I found myself sliding lower and lower into my seat. The rape scene that sets Aileen on her murderous path is vicious. And it doesn't get any easier with the individual killings, especially the last when any vestige of sympathy the audience might have for Wuornos is forfeit. Based solely on the intensity of the subject matter, MONSTER goes up against HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG as arguably the Best Picture of the year.",5,Theron's tour de force,1074211200,"01 16, 2004",2004,3761,"['Whenever', 'suggest', 'acting', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'understood', 'recommendation', 'debatable', 'Not', 'so', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'MONSTER', 'argumentative', 'discussion', 'performance', 'decade', 'perhaps', 'decade', ""'d"", 'care', 'mention', ""n't"", 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actress', 'leading', 'role', 'then', 'justice', 'Oscars', 'will', 'forever', 'lose', 'credibility', 'other', 'performance', 'female', 'actor', '2003', 'even', 'close', 'Not', 'Kidman', 'not', 'Johansson', 'not', 'Keaton', 'anyone', 'else', ""'d"", 'be', 'tempted', 'mention', ""'ll"", 'even', 'sell', 'down', 'river', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Cate', 'Blanchett.In', 'January', '1991', 'aging', 'prostitute', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'arrested', 'Florida', 'was', 'suspected', 'killing', 'seven', 'men', '1989', 'leaving', 'bullet-riddled', 'bodies', 'highways', 'stealing', 'cars', 'cash', 'January', '1992', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'tried', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'death', 'mostly', 'evidence', 'own', 'confessions', 'testimony', 'lesbian', 'lover', 'killing', 'spree', 'Tyria', 'Moore', 'October', '2002', 'state', 'took', 'life', 'MONSTER', 'Aileen', 'story.Even', 'cursory', 'reading', 'Wuornos', 'tragedy', 'Web', 'will', 'indicate', 'challenge', 'Charlize', 'incredibly', 'taxing', 'role', 'not', 'just', 'make-up', 'shaved', 'eyebrows', 'false', 'teeth', 'body', 'alteration', 'thirty', 'pounds', 'added', 'weight', 'costumes', 'actress', 'put', 'role', 'walk', 'talk', 'nervous', 'mannerisms', 'body', 'language', 'Even', 'aura', 'believe', 'such', 'Theron', 'unrecognizable', 'herself', 'transformation', 'apocalyptically', 'stunning.The', 'film', 'course', 'take', 'liberties', 'Tyria', 'Moore', '24-years', 'old', 'when', 'met', 'Wuornos', '1986', 'Selby', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'who', 'about', '18', 'script', 'screenplay', 'inferred', 'time', 'span', 'perhaps', 'several', 'months', 'Aileen-Selby', 'relationship', 'first', 'killing', 'occurred', 'when', 'two', 'first', 'met', 'fact', 'Aileen', 'Tyria', 'spent', 'four', 'years', 'together', 'first', 'murder', 'was', 'committed', 'only', 'end', 'case', 'Ricci', 'consideration', 'Oscar', 'supporting', 'role', 'troubled', 'naive', 'clueless', 'Selby', 'totally', 'depth.At', 'one', 'point', 'Theron', 'Aileen', 'was', 'raped', 'father', 'friends', 'subsequently', 'beat', 'fact', 'Aileen', 'real-life', 'mother', 'divorced', 'Leo', 'Dale', 'Pittman', 'couple', 'months', 'daughter', 'birth', 'Aileen', 'never', 'met', 'natural', 'father', 'Aileen', 'brother', 'were', 'subsequently', 'raised', 'maternal', 'grandparents', 'Lauri', 'Britta', 'Wuornos', 'grandfather', 'drank', 'heavily', 'was', 'physically', 'abusive', 'Aileen', 'engaged', 'pre-marital', 'sex', 'early', 'age', 'was', 'pregnant', '14', 'giving', 'child', 'up', 'adoption', 'ran', 'away', 'home', 'take', 'up', 'hitchhiking', 'prostitution', 'MONSTER', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'Aileen', 'murders', 'later', 'committed', 'Wuornos', 'emotionally', 'psychologically', 'tortured', 'casualty', 'life', 'was', 'who', 'end', 'volunteered', 'death', 'penalty', 'case', 'execution', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'mercy.MONSTER', 'evil', 'human', 'face', 'fact', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'cause', 'discomfiture', 'critics', 'who', 'believe', 'morally', 'black', 'white', 'world.MONSTER', ""n't"", 'easy', 'presentation', 'watch', 'film', 'unwound', 'power', 'Theron', 'performance', 'washed', 'waves', 'found', 'sliding', 'lower', 'lower', 'seat', 'rape', 'scene', 'Aileen', 'murderous', 'path', 'vicious', ""n't"", 'get', 'easier', 'individual', 'killings', 'especially', 'last', 'when', 'vestige', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'might', 'have', 'Wuornos', 'forfeit', 'Based', 'solely', 'intensity', 'subject', 'matter', 'MONSTER', 'up', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'SAND', 'AND', 'FOG', 'arguably', 'Best', 'Picture', 'year']",Monster

622533,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00005JMUK,Josh Hitchens,"[2, 2]","In ""Monster,"" writer-director Patty Jenkins' retelling of the story of serial killer Aileen Wuornos, Charlize Theron gives an Oscar winning performance that will go down in history as one of the best ever captured on film. Theron, a moderate actress previously seen in ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""The Italian Job,"" is a revelation in this wonderfully executed film. Her transformation into the disturbed Aileen Wuornos is so complete and so devestating that part of me still can't believe that it's her.Aileen Wuornos was an abused child that eventually turned to highway prostitution to stay alive. When we first see Aileen, her face is in extreme close up, and it is dirty and battered, just like her soul is beaten down by the horrific life she has endured. Aileen is on the verge of suicide, but her life changes forever when she meets and falls in love with Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) a young lesbian who wants a better life but doesn't want to do the work to achieve it. The two embark on an odd couple romance, and their passionate meeting scenes set the screen aflame. Then Aileen picks up a man who brutally rapes her, and she kills him before he can take her life. She and Selby then make a tenative life together, while Aileen slowly goes off the deep end, killing more men. Selby seems to know nothing about the murders, but she is not as naive as she appears.Charlize Theron plays Aileen Wuornos with a combination of breathtaking ferocity, unexpected humor, unbearable pain, and passionate devotion. She is so increibly real in the part you forget that it's acting. The movie does not condone Wuornos' crimes. Her scenes of killing are painful to watch, but it also paints a portrait of a woman who was utterly destroyed by life, whose last desperate grab for happiness fails. It is unforgettable. Theron's achievement can't be described in words, you just have to see it.A great deal of ""Monster"" works because Christina Ricci is so perfect as Selby Wall. Ricci makes Selby a very complex young woman, who is aware of Aileen's crimes but says nothing as long as it benefits her. Selby seems to be naive and innocent, but she turns out to be far more calculating than the severely disturbed Aileen. Sometimes it's hard to decide who is the real monster. Ricci, one of the best young actresses around, really didn't get much attention for her part in ""Monster."" That's a shame, because without her perfect performance to match Theron's, the movie would't work.""Monster"" is an astounding achievement.

Was it Wournos herself whose years of pent up anger and frustration steming from abuse only set her up to be a walking time bomb, or was it the people in her life who had abused and used her in some way shaped her out to be the person she was to become?One of the theme's brought up in the movie was Wourno's belief that love as all one needs to change and become a good person.  She felt as if she had no choices in the matter of turning tricks and killing, but still, clinged onto the hope, thanks to Selby, that there was something better for the both of them around the corner.Don't get me wrong, her past actions cannot justify the murders she committed, but there were some instances where I felt as if she were a sympathetic character.The movie was good, but what did it for me was Charlize Theron's performance.  I'll admit, I never cared too much for her previous work, but her performance in this movie had me in awe.  If one wants to see the movie for anything, it should be her performance.  Who cares if she gained 30 pounds and sat in a make-up chair for 2 hours getting ""uglied up"" for the part.  She channeled Wournos and she deserves every ounce of credit for taking on such a dark role.",4,Who Is The True Monster?,1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,1438,"['had', 'been', 'familiar', 'story', 'Aileen', 'Wournos', 'few', 'years', 'admit', 'being', 'interested', 'studying', 'criminology', 'female', 'serial', 'killers', 'movie', 'however', 'posed', 'question', 'just', 'who', 'was', 'real', 'monster', 'Was', 'Wournos', 'years', 'pent', 'up', 'anger', 'frustration', 'steming', 'only', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'walking', 'time', 'bomb', 'was', 'people', 'life', 'who', 'had', 'abused', 'used', 'way', 'shaped', 'out', 'be', 'person', 'was', 'become', 'One', 'theme', 'brought', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'Wourno', 'belief', 'love', 'one', 'needs', 'change', 'become', 'good', 'person', 'felt', 'had', 'choices', 'matter', 'turning', 'tricks', 'killing', 'still', 'clinged', 'hope', 'thanks', 'Selby', 'was', 'something', 'better', 'corner.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'past', 'actions', 'can', 'not', 'justify', 'murders', 'committed', 'were', 'instances', 'where', 'felt', 'were', 'sympathetic', 'character.The', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'never', 'cared', 'too', 'much', 'previous', 'work', 'performance', 'movie', 'had', 'awe', 'one', 'see', 'movie', 'anything', 'should', 'be', 'performance', 'Who', 'gained', '30', 'pounds', 'sat', 'make-up', 'chair', '2', 'hours', 'getting', 'uglied', 'up', 'part', 'channeled', 'Wournos', 'ounce', 'credit', 'taking', 'dark', 'role']",Monster

Charlize Theron is great in her all her makeup and profane filled dialogue but the movie is flat. I have seen specials on the real life Aileen and I felt this was just another Hollywood re-creation with key elements left out and other things inserted for dramatic effect because after all the truth is not as interesting right? Just like in another real life story &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; the director takes dramatic license and gives you a one sided view of the story. My main gripe is Christina Ricci's character. Aileen's real life lover was an overweight, butch lesbian. But of course, men will not pay to see two ugly women make out so they insert Christina Ricci and with her dull personality and slow witted charm the film is lauded by our American liberal media. The A&amp;E special is much better than this movie could ever be.

Some of the extras show her in different stages of makeup, and also researching with the director the very places the real life Aileen Wuornos used to frequent, down in Florida on the ugly side.  I thought Scott Wilson also deserved a nomination, he had also a very resonant part as the last man Aileen managed to kill, the one who tried to help her, who was a family man, thus showing that Aileen had become addicted to murder and that her excuses for murdering these men (""they tried to molest me"") had grown paper thin with repetition, even though the first one really did try to murder her and raped her in an ugly way, and yet when the audience watches Scott Wilson die for apparently no reason at all, we're brought back to our memories of him as a handsome young man playing one of the heartless killers in Richard Brooks' IN COLD BLOOD, and we feel that Movie Karma has played a part in deciding his fate.Christina Ricci was pretty good too, though I wonder what the real-life person she's playing had to say about Ricci's portrayal of her as a user, a whiner, a sloth, a slut, and one who would sell out the only person who ever cared for her in the world.Now that the movie OPEN WATER has come out, with its leading actress Blanchard Ryan who is an exact duplicate of the ""pretty"" Charlize Theron, will we ever see that one again or will we always be seeing the grim one with the Lon Chaney makeup?

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 2]","""Monster"" is just one of those films where you want to pull for the villain(or perhaps, victim?) but you know that deep inside she is wrong.  ""Monster"" tells with vivid detail the story of Aileen Wuornos(Theron), a prostitute who has basically been held down her entire life.  Abused sexually, physically and emotionally by her family, Wuornos grows up on the streets as a prostitute.  Eventually she finds true love in the arms of Selby(Ricci), a young outcast who she runs away with.While trying to become honest, Wuornos runs into wall after wall for the simple fact that all she has ever known is prostitution and hate.  She is turned down for jobs due to the lack of experience.  She's even turned away by the unemployment office.  In short, she is kicked hard while she's down.  Returning to hooking, she has a violent experience that ends with the death of a ""John.""  Perhaps he deserved it, that's what you'll probably think when you see the film, but this is only the beginning of a violent string of murders that Wuornos will commit.  Though she does show mercy to one man in the film, she eventually becomes nothing but another cold-blooded murderer who is tailed by the cops.  She runs again, along with Selby, and the rest is history.This is a very disturbing film.  It is openly honest and, as stated before, you will long to cheer for Wuornos, but in the end, she is ultimately a lost soul with no real light at the end of her tunnel.Theron shines as Wuornos, almost unrecognizable under make-up and her own physical alterations.  Ricci does a good job as well, making me want to hate her for the selfish things she does to Wuornos.

622551,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMUK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 12]","&quot;Monster&quot; could easily be overwhelmed by two external factors.  The first is the true story of Aileen Carol Wuornos, who was actually named &quot;America's first female serial killer&quot; by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records.&quot;  Wuornos has been the subject of two documentatries by Nick Broomfield , 1992's &quot;Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer&quot; and 2003's &quot;Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer,&quot; which followed her execution in Florida in 2002, and there are countless other testaments to the crimes for which she was executed.  It is hard not to walk into this movie and not know that this women is going to kill again and again.It is equally impossible to watch this film and not know about Charlize Theron's transformation into Aileen Wuornos.  The story of her weight gain and the make up job that made it difficult to remember this is a beautiful woman are now a Hollywood legend, the feminine counterpart to Robert De Niro's efforts in &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; especially now that her performance has been eternally validated by Theron's Oscar for Best Actress.  The performance is indeed superb, a case of completely inhabiting a part.  What stands out is not what Theron did to her body but what she does with it: the looks and mannerisms that create this compelling character.  Ultimately, the performance is so good that you forget the external reasons why &quot;Monster&quot; would be overwhelmed and just become immersed in the story.What surprised me the most about writer-director Patty Jenkins's film is that it struck me as being a love story more than a horror story.  That is to say, that it has the structure of one.  Throughout the film we get bits and pieces of Aileen's life story, enough to know that she has been the victim of abuse and that years of being a prostitute have driven her down to the point of contemplating suicide.  That is when Aileen meets Selby (Christina Ricci), a young lesbian trying to take her first steps out of the closet.  Aileen has only suffered at the hands of men, so Selby's youth and innocence is very attractive.  Aileen wants to stop hooking, but to get money so that she and Selby can get a hotel room and party for a week is different because she can convince herself that this time she is doing it for somebody else.  But if Aileen finally has a good person in her life fate gives him another punch in the face, literally, when she goes off in the car of a john who might be the worst person she has ever met.In the context of this film the first man that Aileen Wuornos killed deserved it.  Not just in terms of what he did to her but in terms of what could have happened next.  Whether this is what really happened with the first john Wuornos murdered is debatable (after the trial it turned out he had served ten years for a violent rape in another state), this becomes a pivotal event in Jenkins's film.  However Aileen does not start killing more johns at that point.  What she tries to do is find a &quot;real&quot; job.  Of course, she does not have the education or the temperament to do anything other than what she has been doing.  Aileen does not want to go back to hooking, but she also wants to keep Selby happy, and so she finds an alternative in killing the johns.It is not clear if Aileen only kills Johns at this point.  She does not kill all of her johns seen in the film but she clearly intended to, getting herself into the proper frame of mind by convincing herself that all of these men want to beat her and rape her like her first victim.  The tragedy here is that, in the context of the film, this was a woman who wanted to make a better life, but her old life was such that in her warped mind this was the only thing that she can do.  Even as she is killing men who do not deserve to be killed, there is a sense that her history and fate have conspired against her.  It is too much to feel real sympathy for Aileen, but in the tradition of horror films, Jenkins has made her &quot;Monster&quot; a truly pitiable figure.At the end of the film there we are provided two bits of information.  In terms of the real life story of Aileen Wuornos it is the second one, telling us about her execution in 2002, that that would seem to be the more important one.  But in the context of &quot;Monster,&quot; it is the first one that tells us of what the character of Aileen would have considered the end of her life.",5,Patty Jenkins turns a monster in a pitiable figure of horror,1079481600,"03 17, 2004",2004,4450,"['quot', 'Monster', 'quot', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'overwhelmed', 'two', 'external', 'factors', 'first', 'true', 'story', 'Aileen', 'Carol', 'Wuornos', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'named', 'quot', 'America', 'first', 'female', 'serial', 'killer', 'quot', 'quot', 'Guinness', 'Book', 'World', 'Records.', 'quot', 'Wuornos', 'been', 'subject', 'two', 'documentatries', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', '1992', 'quot', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'Selling', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'quot', '2003', 'quot', 'Aileen', 'Life', 'Death', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'quot', 'followed', 'execution', 'Florida', '2002', 'are', 'countless', 'other', 'testaments', 'crimes', 'was', 'executed', 'hard', 'not', 'walk', 'movie', 'not', 'know', 'women', 'going', 'kill', 'again', 'again.It', 'equally', 'impossible', 'watch', 'film', 'not', 'know', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'transformation', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'story', 'weight', 'gain', 'make', 'up', 'job', 'made', 'difficult', 'remember', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'are', 'now', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'feminine', 'counterpart', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'efforts', 'quot', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'quot', 'especially', 'now', 'performance', 'been', 'eternally', 'validated', 'Theron', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'performance', 'indeed', 'superb', 'case', 'completely', 'inhabiting', 'part', 'What', 'out', 'not', 'what', 'Theron', 'did', 'body', 'what', 'looks', 'mannerisms', 'create', 'compelling', 'character', 'Ultimately', 'performance', 'so', 'good', 'forget', 'external', 'reasons', 'why', 'quot', 'Monster', 'quot', 'would', 'be', 'overwhelmed', 'just', 'become', 'immersed', 'story.What', 'surprised', 'most', 'writer-director', 'Patty', 'Jenkins', 'film', 'struck', 'being', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'horror', 'story', 'say', 'structure', 'one', 'film', 'get', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Aileen', 'life', 'story', 'enough', 'know', 'been', 'victim', 'abuse', 'years', 'being', 'prostitute', 'have', 'driven', 'down', 'point', 'contemplating', 'suicide', 'when', 'Aileen', 'Selby', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'young', 'lesbian', 'trying', 'take', 'first', 'steps', 'closet', 'Aileen', 'only', 'suffered', 'hands', 'men', 'Selby', 'youth', 'innocence', 'very', 'attractive', 'Aileen', 'stop', 'hooking', 'get', 'money', 'Selby', 'can', 'get', 'hotel', 'room', 'party', 'week', 'different', 'can', 'convince', 'time', 'doing', 'somebody', 'else', 'Aileen', 'finally', 'good', 'person', 'life', 'fate', 'punch', 'face', 'literally', 'when', 'off', 'car', 'john', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'worst', 'person', 'ever', 'met.In', 'context', 'film', 'first', 'man', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'killed', 'deserved', 'Not', 'just', 'terms', 'what', 'did', 'terms', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'next', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'first', 'john', 'Wuornos', 'murdered', 'debatable', 'trial', 'turned', 'out', 'had', 'served', 'ten', 'years', 'violent', 'rape', 'state', 'pivotal', 'event', 'Jenkins', 'film', 'However', 'Aileen', 'not', 'start', 'killing', 'more', 'johns', 'point', 'What', 'do', 'find', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'job', 'course', 'not', 'have', 'education', 'temperament', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'been', 'doing', 'Aileen', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'hooking', 'also', 'keep', 'Selby', 'happy', 'so', 'alternative', 'killing', 'johns.It', 'not', 'clear', 'Aileen', 'only', 'Johns', 'point', 'not', 'kill', 'johns', 'seen', 'film', 'clearly', 'intended', 'getting', 'proper', 'frame', 'mind', 'convincing', 'men', 'want', 'beat', 'rape', 'first', 'victim', 'tragedy', 'here', 'context', 'film', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'wanted', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'old', 'life', 'was', 'such', 'warped', 'mind', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'Even', 'killing', 'men', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'killed', 'sense', 'history', 'fate', 'have', 'conspired', 'too', 'much', 'feel', 'real', 'sympathy', 'Aileen', 'tradition', 'horror', 'films', 'Jenkins', 'made', 'quot', 'Monster', 'quot', 'truly', 'pitiable', 'figure.At', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'provided', 'two', 'bits', 'information', 'terms', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'second', 'one', 'telling', 'execution', '2002', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'important', 'one', 'context', 'quot', 'Monster', 'quot', 'first', 'one', 'what', 'character', 'Aileen', 'would', 'have', 'considered', 'end', 'life']",Monster
622552,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JMUK,Lawyeraau,"[1, 1]","This controversial film is worth seeing, if only for Charlize Theron's outstanding, Academy Award winning performance. Ms. Theron totally loses herself in the character of Aileen Wuornos, the serial killer who murdered seven men in Florida and was arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. Aileen Wuornos was finally executed in 2002, after spending many years on death row.The film details the hard knocks life led by Aileen Wuornos, from that of a troubled teenager looking for love in all the wrong places to that of a hard living prostitute. It also looks at the very human side of Aileen Wuornos, a woman who found love in the person of a troubled, young lesbian in her late teens (Christina Ricci), who would ultimately betray the trust that Aileen Wuornos believed lay between her and her eventual fate.Ms. Theron's physical transformation is startling, though I found her still recognizable as Charlize Theron. It is her performance, however, rather than her physical transformation, that is more startling, as she infuses it with a high voltage intensity and swagger that bowls the viewer over. She makes the person of Aileen Wuornos come to life. She is a low rent individual, white trash to the core, prostituting herself by getting into cars in order to have sex with total strangers. So, this film is not for the fastidious, as we are looking at the seamy underbelly of the beast in this film, and it sure isn't pretty. It is also a credit to Ms. Theron's compelling performance that the viewer is able to feel pity for Aileen Wuornos, a woman who is so vile, yet, at the same time, so vulnerable and pathetic.The direction is excellent in the film, as are all the supporting performances. Christina Ricci is very good as the weak, passive, troubled young woman with whom Aileen Wuornos enters into a lesbian love affair, a relationship which lasted years in real life rather than the short time depicted in the film. Ms. Ricci infuses the role with a certain amoral, vapid selfishness that makes the character's betrayal of Aileen Wuornos comprehensible. Bruce Dern, in the role of Thomas, Aileen Wuornos' only true friend, is a stand out, as he adds depth to an otherwise small role. It is clear that Thomas saw something in Aileen Wuornos that the rest of the world missed. It is the most decent relationship that Aileen Wuornos appears to have had.The film itself, despite the stellar performances, is somewhat flawed, as it is unclear as to what made Aileen Wuornos tick, though it makes an attempt at deciphering her psyche. There are several theories that are exposed for the viewer to ponder: abused child, rape victim, and love sick puppet. They fall short of explaining adequately this troubled woman who would go on to achieve such notoriety. Notwithstanding this unresolved issue, the film is still a compelling one, though not one I would necessarily care to view again, as there is nothing at all uplifting about the disturbing and sordid life led by Aileen Wuornos. Consequently, I consider this film to be a one shot deal, despite the wonderful performances.",4,A COMPELLING LOOK AT A SORDID LIFE...,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,3097,"['controversial', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'outstanding', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'performance', 'Ms.', 'Theron', 'totally', 'character', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'murdered', 'seven', 'men', 'Florida', 'was', 'arrested', 'tried', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'death', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'finally', 'executed', '2002', 'spending', 'many', 'years', 'death', 'row.The', 'film', 'details', 'hard', 'knocks', 'life', 'led', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'troubled', 'teenager', 'looking', 'love', 'wrong', 'places', 'hard', 'living', 'prostitute', 'also', 'very', 'human', 'side', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'woman', 'who', 'found', 'love', 'person', 'troubled', 'young', 'lesbian', 'late', 'teens', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'who', 'would', 'ultimately', 'betray', 'trust', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'believed', 'lay', 'eventual', 'fate.Ms', 'Theron', 'physical', 'transformation', 'startling', 'found', 'still', 'recognizable', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'performance', 'however', 'rather', 'physical', 'transformation', 'more', 'startling', 'high', 'voltage', 'intensity', 'swagger', 'viewer', 'person', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'come', 'life', 'low', 'rent', 'individual', 'white', 'trash', 'core', 'prostituting', 'getting', 'cars', 'order', 'have', 'sex', 'total', 'strangers', 'So', 'film', 'not', 'fastidious', 'are', 'looking', 'seamy', 'underbelly', 'beast', 'film', 'sure', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'also', 'credit', 'Ms.', 'Theron', 'compelling', 'performance', 'viewer', 'able', 'feel', 'pity', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'vile', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'so', 'vulnerable', 'pathetic.The', 'direction', 'excellent', 'film', 'are', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'very', 'good', 'weak', 'passive', 'troubled', 'young', 'woman', 'whom', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'lesbian', 'love', 'affair', 'relationship', 'lasted', 'years', 'real', 'life', 'rather', 'short', 'time', 'depicted', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Ricci', 'role', 'certain', 'amoral', 'vapid', 'selfishness', 'character', 'betrayal', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'comprehensible', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'role', 'Thomas', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'only', 'true', 'friend', 'stand', 'out', 'depth', 'otherwise', 'small', 'role', 'clear', 'Thomas', 'saw', 'something', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'rest', 'world', 'missed', 'most', 'decent', 'relationship', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'have', 'had.The', 'film', 'stellar', 'performances', 'somewhat', 'flawed', 'unclear', 'what', 'made', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'tick', 'attempt', 'deciphering', 'psyche', 'are', 'several', 'theories', 'are', 'exposed', 'viewer', 'ponder', 'abused', 'child', 'rape', 'victim', 'love', 'sick', 'puppet', 'fall', 'short', 'explaining', 'adequately', 'troubled', 'woman', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'achieve', 'such', 'notoriety', 'Notwithstanding', 'unresolved', 'issue', 'film', 'still', 'compelling', 'one', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'necessarily', 'care', 'view', 'again', 'nothing', 'uplifting', 'disturbing', 'sordid', 'life', 'led', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'Consequently', 'consider', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'shot', 'deal', 'wonderful', 'performances']",Monster

And there is no way of knowing about the details of the relationship between Aileen Wuomos and her young lesbian girlfriend Selby, played by Christina Ricci.  But it doesn't really matter because, due to the excellent writing and directing by Patty Jenkins, the characters come across as very real and very human.Charlize Theron is cast as Aileen in a performance that won her an Academy Award.  Whoever did her makeup should get an award too.  All her glamour and ""babe-like"" qualities are hidden.  And what comes out is the true actor inside of her in every sense of the word.  Every gesture, every expression on her face and every bit of anger and pain come through as authentic and real.  She's totally believable as the deeply troubled woman, damaged by life.  She's desperate for love and a little bit of happiness.  But she hasn't a chance.  When one of her customers seriously mistreats her, she kills him in self-defense.  After that she just keeps killing.As I recently saw the documentary about her life just a few days ago, I couldn't help comparing the films. Both were excellent.

Such gross exploitation of the terrible deeds of Aileen Wuornos makes one queasy in the stomach.  Arrested in 1991 and executed in 2002, Aileen Wuornos was not the first female serial killer in the world, or the first woman executed for murder in the U.S., but she was the U.S.'s first female serial killer.  A highway prostitute who killed only men, she was a scary looking woman whose simmering rage was visible in photos of her staring dark brown eyes.Monster was written and directed by Patty Jenkins, who says in the DVD featurette that she was just ""showing what she sees,"" and would let people make up their own minds.  But unlike an objective journalist armed only with the facts, Jenkins writes a fictionalized script with made-up characters and events.  Although Aileen killed around seven men, we see only four killings in the film.  In the film, people treat her with horrible cruelty, for example a job counselor who says she can only get factory work, but there is none, and a lawyer at a firm where Aileen goes seeking work as a secretary.  It seems unrealistic that everyone would have been so vicious to a woman seeking a job.  That said, Monster is still worth a viewing or two.Charlize Theron worked hard to play the killer Wuornos.  Her performance is like watching the real thing.  Every muscle in her face, every minute expression, conveys more than words ever could (which is good, considering the weakness of the script).  In the film, the Monster has a lot of humanity.  It has just gone unrecognized, which is incredibly tragic and moving.  Christina Ricci plays her girlfriend, Selby.  Bruce Dern plays a Vietnam vet who is Aileen's only friend.  He gives a great performance. I love me some Bruce Dern!The score by BT is perfect- but never played!  Most of the movie plays with no music!  And when there is music, it is barely audible over the speaking.  Memorable shots and lines I can count on one hand.  The most striking photography shows Wuornos resting under an overpass, as cars pass by.  I would have used these shots a lot more.  Monster is really more like a made for TV/Lifetime movie than a large film production.Monster ends strongly.  The last phone call between Wuornos and her girlfriend was very well done and had the most emotional impact of any scene in the film. At the end of the movie, I cried despite saying I would never cry for this murderer.  But I cried for this wasted life, this abandoned soul, and for other abandoned souls out there, looking for survival and for love.",3,A Wasted Life,1124236800,"08 17, 2005",2005,2614,"['Last', 'Resort', 'Bar', 'Grill', 'have', 'sign', 'Home', 'Cold', 'Beer', 'Killer', 'Women', 'Such', 'gross', 'exploitation', 'terrible', 'deeds', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'one', 'queasy', 'stomach', 'Arrested', '1991', 'executed', '2002', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'female', 'serial', 'killer', 'world', 'first', 'woman', 'executed', 'murder', 'U.S.', 'was', 'U.S.', 'first', 'female', 'serial', 'killer', 'highway', 'prostitute', 'who', 'killed', 'only', 'men', 'was', 'scary', 'looking', 'woman', 'simmering', 'rage', 'was', 'visible', 'photos', 'staring', 'dark', 'brown', 'eyes.Monster', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Patty', 'Jenkins', 'who', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'was', 'just', 'showing', 'what', 'would', 'let', 'people', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'minds', 'objective', 'journalist', 'armed', 'only', 'facts', 'Jenkins', 'fictionalized', 'script', 'made-up', 'characters', 'events', 'Aileen', 'killed', 'around', 'seven', 'men', 'see', 'only', 'four', 'killings', 'film', 'film', 'people', 'treat', 'horrible', 'cruelty', 'example', 'job', 'counselor', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'factory', 'work', 'none', 'lawyer', 'firm', 'where', 'Aileen', 'seeking', 'work', 'secretary', 'unrealistic', 'everyone', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'vicious', 'woman', 'seeking', 'job', 'said', 'Monster', 'still', 'worth', 'viewing', 'two.Charlize', 'Theron', 'worked', 'hard', 'play', 'killer', 'Wuornos', 'performance', 'watching', 'real', 'thing', 'muscle', 'face', 'minute', 'expression', 'more', 'words', 'ever', 'could', 'good', 'considering', 'weakness', 'script', 'film', 'Monster', 'lot', 'humanity', 'just', 'gone', 'unrecognized', 'incredibly', 'tragic', 'moving', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'girlfriend', 'Selby', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'who', 'Aileen', 'only', 'friend', 'great', 'performance', 'love', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'score', 'BT', 'perfect-', 'never', 'played', 'Most', 'movie', 'music', 'when', 'music', 'barely', 'audible', 'speaking', 'Memorable', 'shots', 'lines', 'can', 'count', 'one', 'hand', 'most', 'striking', 'photography', 'shows', 'resting', 'overpass', 'cars', 'pass', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'shots', 'lot', 'more', 'Monster', 'really', 'more', 'made', 'TV/Lifetime', 'movie', 'large', 'film', 'production.Monster', 'strongly', 'last', 'phone', 'call', 'Wuornos', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'had', 'most', 'emotional', 'impact', 'scene', 'film', 'end', 'movie', 'cried', 'saying', 'would', 'never', 'cry', 'murderer', 'cried', 'wasted', 'life', 'abandoned', 'soul', 'other', 'abandoned', 'souls', 'there', 'looking', 'survival', 'love']",Monster

She is extremely convincing as serial killer Aileen Wuornos, giving a haunting and well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance. The otherwise gorgeous star transforms into the not so gorgeous killer and gives a very eerie and sympathetic performance. I was wowed.Charlize Theron may rule the film, but the always wonderful Christina Ricci is very good as well, playing her love interest Selby. She brings an immature vulnerability and wide-eyed innocence to her character and pulls a real person out of what could be just a ball of insecurities.This is not a movie that is easy to sit through; it is dark, ugly, and violent. An early scene in which Aileen is raped is almost traumatizing at best, it is so lacking in any form of humanity. In another scene, a too-far-gone Aileen comes across an elderly gentleman who is genuinely willing to help the woman, but that isn't something that Aileen is prepared to deal with if it comes from a man. His needless death is an eye-opening turning point to the film, when it really sinks in that this woman is hopelessly lost and can probably never be found.Fair warning: this is a dark, harshly severe movie with no relief until the house lights come up, but if you can disconnect yourself from the onscreen horrors for a few moments, you'll see a story of humanity's worst nightmare: individuals cast aside with no ability to crawl out of the hole into which they've been thrown. There is certainly a message here that needs to be heard, and this movie is one that should be seen. I highly recommend it to those with an open mind, but it is definitely not for the squeamish.

622564,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B00005JMUK,M. Burns,"[24, 37]","After thinking about it for half-a-week now, I'm still not exactly sure where I stand on Monster, the controversial film that has taken actress Charlize Theron to new levels of artistic stardom. Monster is primarily concerned with Aileen Wuornos (Theron), ""America's first female serial killer,"" who shot and killed seven men during her time as a prostitute along Florida's Highway 75 (and was famously executed in 2002). At the same time, we also see Wuornos's blooming lesbian relationship with Selby Wall (Christina Ricci), a young, shy woman that brings joy (and some confusion) into Wuornos's life for a time. The movie starts promising - Theron and Ricci have some sort of chemistry that alternates between being awkward and passionate, highlighted by a spirited skate in a rink and a startlingly moving ride on a carousel. It's when the movie starts to deal with the 'issues' of Wuornos that it isn't so sure - a few notions and theories on what lived in the soul of Wuornos are tossed around, but they're never really put together in a fashion where the viewer feels like they've gained insight. At times, Wuornos is portrayed as a vengeful rapist-killer, but then later she's shown as a heartless killer. At one point, Wuornos's history of being abused is brought into light, but it quickly dies and never really makes anything of itself. I get the feeling that director/screenwriter Patty Jenkins really had a few few profound ideas about Wuornos, but I don't feel that they transferred to the screen so well. That's not to say that Theron's performance is damaged by the movie's flaws. It's simply...amazing to watch her unfold - she's so in-control of her portrayal, but it feels so raw and natural that (not to sound clich&eacute;d, but) you really forget it's her. Every moment of her embodiment of Wuornos is compelling, in some way, to watch, and it reaches its heartbreaking crescendo in the movie's finale - one of the best of the year. So I'll bet you can see why I'm conflicted about the film. Narratively, it stumbles, but Theron and Ricci are both flawless, and when it comes down to it, the movie has a lot more going for it than going against it. Monster is far from perfect, but it's still an essential viewing experience for the new year - if anything, for Theron, who deserves an Oscar for so much more than just her physical transformation.

The overall effectiveness of this film, however, is too powerful to deny. It was an amazing work of art. This film is so well done, so well thought out and written, that what is left is a portrait of a ruined human being caught in a downward spiral of horrible self-laceration.The main character's unbreakable decent into evil is charted out like a map with only one road. There were actual scenes (particularly the &quot;job interview&quot; scenes) where I found this killer heartbreaking - just as heartbreaking as I found the killer's last victim (the great character actor, Scott Wilson) pleading for his life.What can be said about Charlize Theron's performance that hasn't already been said?

622566,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JMUK,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[0, 0]","I love to drink while watching movies, but I was so transfixed while watching this movie, I barely drank at all, and had a dry mouth by the end of this movie. I'd be shocked if I blinked at all, while watching this.I bought this, purely because it was in the sales, and it was on my wishlist. And I needed to spend some money. So I got this.I'd never really heard of Aileen Wuornos before, apart from all the press coverage saying that Charlize Theron was going to play her. Now, I'm more curious about her whole story, and after watching the movie, I'm curious to find out what happened to Selby, apart from the fact they never spoke again. I'm curious to find out why these people like Aileen spend so much time on Death Row, and why they can't be exectuted straight away. To spend 12 years (and more, in the case of Kenny Ritchie) on Death Row, only to die in the end seems pointless.As soon as Charlize appeared on screen as the hard, butch, Aileen, my mouth dropped open. I just could not believe it was the same girl. There's two shots in the movie where she appears topless, and in just her underwear, and it's amazing to see the physical transformation she's gone through just to play Aileen. Charlize, notorious in my eyes for being super skinny, has boobs & a booty, and cellulite. There is a God after all! She gained 30lbs for this movie, and although it's slightly too much, she looks better with a little bit more flesh. She's so tall (5ft 9 and a half - the half is always important), that she can carry it off well, whereas, Christina Ricci, who only gained 10lbs, looks plain dumpy. After a while, you stop comparing the Charlize on screen, to her normal self, and you get caught up in the story, and really begin to believe that it's Aileen - it's almost like her spirit possessed Charlize. Not many actresses can pull that off.What was so noticable about Christina, apart from how utterly short she was next to Charlize (she's 5ft 1), was how young she looked. This was probably to make the difference between the two actresses as big as possible. And Christina's hair was dreadful! Absolutely dreadful! With only five years between the two actresses, it would have been difficult to make the beautiful actresses look as harsh as possible, to make a bigger comparison.I loved this movie, I was warned beforehand that I would probably hate it, but I didn't. I was fascinated by the entire movie, and was shocked, and was nearly in tears by the end of the movie. It never excuses the murders, or attempts to make them any less cold-blooded murders than they already were. Also shown is that Lee (her full name is never given in the movie) does have compassion - she never killed the stuttering virgin. The film is shown to be very bleak & sparse, and none of it was in the slightest OTT. Just a grittier, more realistic version of Thelma & Louise.Aileen's murder victims have been fictionlised to spare their families more grief & embarrassment. But they're still well-portrayed, especially the last John. You really felt for Aileen & him in the final moments.If you're a rather sensitive soul, and cross yourself every time someone swears, then you should avoid this movie. Aileen drops the F-word (and other related words) a mere 189 times. But her coarse language is absolutely necessary to the character. You can't imagine Aileen every being brought up to speak politely.This movie has definitely aroused my interest in Aileen, and I'm going on the hunt for her biography, which is no doubt out there somewhere. The movie & Charlize have to be seen to be believed, and afterwards, a lasting impression will be made on you. This is a movie that will never be forgotton.",4,Extremely powerful,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,3689,"['love', 'drink', 'watching', 'movies', 'was', 'so', 'transfixed', 'watching', 'movie', 'barely', 'drank', 'had', 'dry', 'mouth', 'end', 'movie', ""'d"", 'be', 'shocked', 'blinked', 'watching', 'this.I', 'bought', 'purely', 'was', 'sales', 'was', 'wishlist', 'needed', 'spend', 'money', 'got', 'this.I', ""'d"", 'never', 'really', 'heard', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'apart', 'press', 'coverage', 'saying', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'Now', ""'m"", 'more', 'curious', 'whole', 'story', 'watching', 'movie', ""'m"", 'curious', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Selby', 'apart', 'fact', 'never', 'spoke', 'again', ""'m"", 'curious', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'people', 'Aileen', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'Death', 'Row', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'exectuted', 'straight', 'away', 'spend', '12', 'years', 'more', 'case', 'Kenny', 'Ritchie', 'Death', 'Row', 'only', 'die', 'end', 'pointless.As', 'soon', 'Charlize', 'appeared', 'screen', 'hard', 'butch', 'Aileen', 'mouth', 'dropped', 'open', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'was', 'same', 'girl', 'two', 'shots', 'movie', 'where', 'topless', 'just', 'underwear', 'amazing', 'see', 'physical', 'transformation', 'gone', 'through', 'just', 'play', 'Aileen', 'Charlize', 'notorious', 'eyes', 'being', 'super', 'skinny', 'boobs', 'booty', 'cellulite', 'God', 'gained', '30lbs', 'movie', 'slightly', 'too', 'much', 'better', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'flesh', 'so', 'tall', '5ft', '9', 'half', 'half', 'always', 'important', 'can', 'carry', 'off', 'well', 'whereas', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'who', 'only', 'gained', '10lbs', 'plain', 'dumpy', 'while', 'stop', 'comparing', 'Charlize', 'screen', 'normal', 'self', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'really', 'begin', 'believe', 'Aileen', 'almost', 'spirit', 'possessed', 'Charlize', 'Not', 'many', 'actresses', 'can', 'pull', 'was', 'so', 'noticable', 'Christina', 'apart', 'how', 'utterly', 'short', 'was', 'next', 'Charlize', '5ft', '1', 'was', 'how', 'young', 'looked', 'was', 'probably', 'make', 'difference', 'two', 'actresses', 'as', 'big', 'possible', 'Christina', 'hair', 'was', 'dreadful', 'Absolutely', 'dreadful', 'only', 'five', 'years', 'two', 'actresses', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'make', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'look', 'as', 'harsh', 'possible', 'make', 'bigger', 'comparison.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'warned', 'would', 'probably', 'hate', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'fascinated', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'shocked', 'was', 'nearly', 'tears', 'end', 'movie', 'never', 'murders', 'attempts', 'make', 'less', 'cold-blooded', 'murders', 'already', 'were', 'Also', 'shown', 'Lee', 'full', 'name', 'never', 'given', 'movie', 'have', 'compassion', 'never', 'killed', 'stuttering', 'virgin', 'film', 'shown', 'be', 'very', 'bleak', 'sparse', 'none', 'was', 'slightest', 'OTT', 'Just', 'grittier', 'more', 'realistic', 'version', 'Thelma', 'Louise.Aileen', 'murder', 'victims', 'have', 'been', 'fictionlised', 'spare', 'families', 'more', 'grief', 'embarrassment', ""'re"", 'still', 'well-portrayed', 'especially', 'last', 'John', 'really', 'felt', 'Aileen', 'final', 'moments.If', ""'re"", 'rather', 'sensitive', 'soul', 'cross', 'time', 'someone', 'swears', 'then', 'should', 'avoid', 'movie', 'Aileen', 'F-word', 'other', 'related', 'words', 'mere', '189', 'times', 'coarse', 'language', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Aileen', 'being', 'brought', 'up', 'speak', 'politely.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'aroused', 'interest', 'Aileen', ""'m"", 'going', 'hunt', 'biography', 'doubt', 'there', 'somewhere', 'movie', 'Charlize', 'have', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'afterwards', 'lasting', 'impression', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'forgotton']",Monster
622567,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00005JMUK,Michael Butts,"[2, 2]","Oscar smiled on Charlize Theron.  And boy did she deserve it.  Her performance (aside from the much ballyhooed physical transformation) is the stuff legends are made of.  There isn't a moment that Theron isn't Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who murdered at least seven of her johns.  Charlize takes each movement, each emotion, each glance and makes Aileen a character you DO feel sorry for.And for me, that's the problem with MONSTER.  Aileen certainly had a difficult upbringing, a youth full of abuse, of not being pretty, of not being loved.  But, ultimately, does that justify the lives she took?  Granted, her first kill could be considered as self-defense. But later she planned her murders, she solicited these johns knowing she would murder them, and doing it just so she could keep her little kewpie doll lover, Selby.  Director/writer Patty Jensen obviously stacked the deck in favor of Aileen, trying to manipulate her audience into accepting Aileen as the victim of her background, of men who used women, etc.  But what about the last victim she killed?  He wasn't even interested in her for sex, but she killed him anyway.  This is a heartless, self-centered, and certainly disturbed woman who demonstrated little remorse in the end.  MONSTER is a manipulative film, and one that tries to make light of Aileen's crimes.  It also portrays her lover as a selfish, self-centered young girl who couldn't face up to the fact that not only did she know what Aileen was doing, but encouraged her to continue doing it, just so she could get her house by the beach.  Serial killers are not role models, and although one can sympathize to a point, this movie whitewashes the facts with its unabashed bias for Aileen.But, as a movie, one can't fault the performances.  Not only is Theron brilliant, but Christina Ricci does a fine job as Selby, even though her character ends up being as despicable as Aileen.And while we're at it, why should we feel sorry for Aileen when she goes for a job interview at a law office without a resume?  Is this really true to life?  You don't get interviews for legal secretaries without a resume, and just because Aileen WANTED the job, why should she get it when she's not qualified?  This manipulation of facts by director Jensen is typical of the stacked deck of a movie.Worth seeing for Charlize Theron's undeniably jawdropping performance, but don't make the mistake of buying the awkward sentimentality it is trying to gag you with.",3,A HARD FILM TO JUDGE,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,2474,"['Oscar', 'smiled', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'boy', 'did', 'deserve', 'performance', 'aside', 'much', 'ballyhooed', 'physical', 'transformation', 'stuff', 'legends', 'are', 'made', ""n't"", 'moment', 'Theron', ""n't"", 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'prostitute', 'who', 'murdered', 'least', 'seven', 'johns', 'Charlize', 'movement', 'emotion', 'glance', 'Aileen', 'character', 'DO', 'feel', 'sorry', 'for.And', 'problem', 'MONSTER', 'Aileen', 'certainly', 'had', 'difficult', 'upbringing', 'youth', 'full', 'abuse', 'not', 'being', 'pretty', 'not', 'being', 'loved', 'ultimately', 'justify', 'lives', 'took', 'Granted', 'first', 'kill', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'self-defense', 'later', 'planned', 'murders', 'solicited', 'johns', 'knowing', 'would', 'murder', 'doing', 'just', 'could', 'keep', 'little', 'kewpie', 'doll', 'lover', 'Selby', 'Director/writer', 'Patty', 'Jensen', 'obviously', 'stacked', 'deck', 'favor', 'Aileen', 'trying', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'accepting', 'Aileen', 'victim', 'background', 'men', 'who', 'used', 'women', 'etc', 'what', 'last', 'victim', 'killed', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'interested', 'sex', 'killed', 'anyway', 'heartless', 'self-centered', 'certainly', 'disturbed', 'woman', 'who', 'demonstrated', 'little', 'remorse', 'end', 'MONSTER', 'manipulative', 'film', 'one', 'make', 'light', 'Aileen', 'crimes', 'also', 'lover', 'selfish', 'self-centered', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'face', 'up', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'know', 'what', 'Aileen', 'was', 'doing', 'encouraged', 'continue', 'doing', 'just', 'could', 'get', 'house', 'beach', 'Serial', 'killers', 'are', 'not', 'role', 'models', 'one', 'can', 'sympathize', 'point', 'movie', 'facts', 'unabashed', 'bias', 'Aileen.But', 'movie', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'performances', 'Not', 'only', 'Theron', 'brilliant', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'fine', 'job', 'Selby', 'even', 'character', 'up', 'being', 'as', 'despicable', 'Aileen.And', ""'re"", 'why', 'should', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Aileen', 'when', 'job', 'interview', 'law', 'office', 'resume', 'really', 'true', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'interviews', 'legal', 'secretaries', 'resume', 'just', 'Aileen', 'WANTED', 'job', 'why', 'should', 'get', 'when', 'not', 'qualified', 'manipulation', 'facts', 'director', 'Jensen', 'typical', 'stacked', 'deck', 'movie.Worth', 'seeing', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'undeniably', 'jawdropping', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'buying', 'awkward', 'sentimentality', 'trying', 'gag']",Monster

Wuornos was a prostitute planning on committing suicide, but a stop at a bar for a drink would change her mind. At the bar she met Selby, a shy lesbian looking for a friend. The two hit it off and become a couple of sorts. It is an unhealthy relationship with each feeding off of the other. Wuornos provides the money by prostitution until one night she is raped and ends up killing the guy. This is the only ""justifyable"" murder, but leads to many more as this becomes easier for Wuornos to do than offer sex. Selby is encouraging of this in a round about way, and is to some degree just as guilty. But the killing of the wrong person at the wrong time eventually sends their house of cards crashing. Charlize Theron pulls out all stops in this role, and succeeds greatly. My only objection to this movie is the way it encourages the viewer to sympathize with Wuornos and maybe even feel sorry for her.

622570,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JMUK,Miles D. Moore,"[2, 4]","There is an old literary and cinematic adage that great monsters evoke both pity and terror. By that standard, Charlize Theron makes a magnificent monster as serial killer Aileen Wuornos; by any standard Theron's performance in Patty Jenkins' ""Monster"" must stand as one of the most courageous and emotionally naked in recent memory. The beautiful Theron deglamorized herself severely to play Wuornos, a ""highway hooker"" who in the movie is driven to madness and murder by a combination of family rejection, grinding poverty, abusive johns and her hopeless love for a young girl (played persuasively by Christina Ricci). But is this the way it really happened? Sue Russell, a freelance journalist and author of a book about Wuornos, faults the movie among other things for not showing that Wuornos' murderous temper, in fact, first showed itself in childhood, long before the events of the movie. Russell also points out that while Wuornos probably was raped several times, it is highly doubtful that any of the johns she murdered were among her rapists. While these are important points, there is no denying that Wuornos' situation was dire, and not entirely of her own making. Wuornos is already a desperate character when we first see her, taking shelter from the rain under a highway overpass and contemplating suicide. Theron brilliantly evokes Wuornos' mental disintegration; toward the end, still talking up her dreams, her eyes are as blank and expressionless as a shark's. ""Monster"" isn't exactly pleasant viewing, but thanks to Jenkins' craftsmanship and Theron's performance, it keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.

622571,A1E15WYG9C47X1,B00005JMUK,"""mobby_uk""","[1, 1]","I don't think the Academy Awards people have had any trouble in choosing the winner for the best actress in a leading role, nor I think they took too much time to arrive at their decision,despite the other wonderful performances of the other nominees.Anyone who watches Monster, and the mind blowing performance that is so gritty, real and totally involved and involving would not flinch for a second in presenting Charlize Theron with a truly deserved award!The story itself, a biopic of infamous serial killer Aileen Wuornos, has been filmed before,(I don't think such a 'meaty' subject matter for a movie would had to wait till now to be filmed),but there is a difference..For one, all credit should go to writer/director Patty Jenkins for her totally sympathetic and unsentimental treatment of the Wuornos story.She was more than capable of handling the complexity of emotions, with very visual as well as character based approach.Although the story is told largely from Wuornos's point of view, the success that Jenkins manages to achieve is to win the viewer's sympathy for both killer and victims: there are no real monsters in Wuornos's story..just a very tragic life, a woman who has been abused for so long by family and 'customers' and neglected by society at large when she tried to 'go straight', pushing her back into the ending that she could not avoid.And while the loss of lives of the innocent men she killed was totally inexcusable, the feeling I got from the film was that Aileen Wuornos was also dead long before she was executed.A very powerful scene sees Wuornos in the back of a corrupt cop's car, allegedly booked for some complaint but picked up for sexual favors. She tries to pretend that she is having a day off from a normal 9 to 5 job,but then the cop revealing that he knows what she does for a living, replies sarcastically, do you go to church on your day off?I find this scene extremely important because it shows how Wuornos tried to maintain her dignity as a human being but failed..very sad indeed.The relationship between Aileen and Selby (played so well by Christina Ricci in one of the best roles so far) which is central to the whole story,was very well written. We know that Wuornos was not gay but someone who craved affection and love and (as she says in the film)can 'train' herself to love a woman to achieve a most desperate need to love and be loved.I thought the love scenes were very well filmed, with enough passion between the two women, yet never gratuitous.Now a word about the acting again..Charlize Theron is not only one of the most beautiful women ever, but she is equally talented..She reminded me a bit of De Niro, Hoffman, Kidman or Streep, that kind of actor/actress who totally dedicates him/herself to his/her role, not only emotionally but physically as well..and had I not known she is playing the lead role, I would have been be excused even for few seconds for failing to recognize her..this is how great the physical transformation and likeness to the real Wuornos is.I would also like to mention that I real loved Pruitt Taylor Vince, one of the best actors in American Cinema today, and although his role was short, he as usual excelled.So Monster is a real gem of a movie, a tragic story about the life of one woman who from early on had all the odds stacked against her, and at a moment of weakness unleashed demons that slowly took control of her, and had to pay dearly for it.

622572,A3RINLIDX74QLP,B00005JMUK,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[4, 5]","This was one of the most gut-wrenching movies I've seen in quite a while. It takes the life of serial killer Aileen Wuornos, one of only ten women to be executed in the United States since the reinstatement of the death penalty, and actually makes us empathize with her. Wuornos's story is a tragic one, and when one looks at her history it becomes clear that she was doomed from the beginning. Repeatedly molested by a family friend as a child, she began prostituting herself by the age of thirteen. It was the only job she ever knew. The movie picks up with Aileen (Charlize Theron) as an adult, suicidally depressed, entering a gay bar. There she meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci), a similarly lonely and depressed, yet far more naive, lesbian teenager. The two, desperate for love and companionship, enter into an odd sort of relationship. But unfortunately, as Aileen quickly finds out, love is not enough.At first Aileen and Selby build grand dreams of creating a new, ""normal"" life together. Aileen plans to clean up, stop hooking, and get a real job. But with no experience, no degree, and an abrasive personality that offers a glimpse at the deep-rooted and barely-restrained anger constantly seething inside her, she is turned down at every place she applies. Ultimately, she returns to hooking. The situation intensifies when, brutally raped and beaten, Aileen kills one of her customers with a handgun. From here on we see her pulled further and further into a tangled web of murders, each one embroiling her more and making it harder to contemplate turning back.The progression of her murders makes an interesting study. (At least, the way they are shown here is fascinating. It is hard to know the exact circumstances of Aileen Wuornos's murders since she continually changed the details of her confession.) Her first victim clearly deserved what he got, and is a perfect example of what made Aileen hate men. But after this Aileen begins to see murder as a way of getting money and thereby supporting herself and Selby. With each successive killing we see Aileen's demeanor change. At first she still shows signs of having a heart and some human feeling. But by the third murder her manner is far more calculating and cold. Killing has become a business transaction. And by the time she kills her seventh and final victim, who wasn't even a customer but simply a kindly man trying to offer some help, we see that she has reached a point of no return.Do the unfortunate circumstances surrounding Aileen Wuornos's life excuse her murders? Certainly not. But ""Monster"" manages to show a much more human side to her than most of the articles written about her case. We can, at least, understand WHY she ended up as she did. Abused and molested, she never knew the love that every child needs in order to grow into a healthy adult. She became pregnant in her early teens, was turned out of her home by the surviving members of her family (her father, in prison, had committed suicide, and many other family members were lost to drugs, illness, and other causes), and gave her child up for adoption. From then on she earned money the only way she knew how, by prostitution, and when she did try to find a better job, she was repeatedly turned down. If only ONE person had offered her any kind of chance at some sort of real job, then - though it's impossible to know for sure and one can only speculate - perhaps she would not have ultimately resorted to murder.Aileen did manage to find love, after a fashion, with the aforementioned Selby Wall, but it was not the kind of love she needed in order to prevent her downward slide into murder and madness. Selby, in whom Aileen can see traces of her own younger self, has not seen much of the world. Though at odds with her own family, she has never known true hardship. She is naive and selfish. Though the relationship between Aileen and Selby has plenty of raw passion, it possesses none of the things that make a relationship really work. Selby is still a child, expecting Aileen to support and take care of her, and simply cannot make up for the love and nourishment that Aileen's childhood lacked.Charlize Theron deserved every ounce of her Academy Award as Best Actress for this movie. She did not just portray Aileen Wuornos - she WAS Aileen Wuornos. The physical transformation alone is incredible, makeup making the usually stunning Theron nearly unrecognizable, but her actual performance is above and beyond. The speech, the swagger, every little mannerism is nailed down to perfection. Christina Ricci also turns in a very good performance, and is very convincing as the angsty, lonely lesbian teen who just wants to find someone she can connect with. The rest of the roles in the film are minor by comparison, but all are done well.My only reason for giving this film four stars instead of five is the fact that it is just so depressing. It's not the kind of movie you'll want to see again. I loved it, and believe it was incredibly well done, but it doesn't leave one feeling very good about the world, except to be thankful for the things we tend to take for granted and that Aileen never got, like a loving family, supportive friends, education, and a chance at a rewarding career. Also, ""Monster"" isn't a movie for everyone. It's not very gory as far as serial killer films go, but it's certainly violent and disturbing. If you can generally handle such movies, however, I'd highly recommend it, as it's well worth seeing. However, because of the fact that it's simply not the kind of film you'd want to see over and over again, I'd suggest it as a rental rather than a purchase.",4,"Disturbing, fascinating, and executed

622575,A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R,B00005JMUK,Movie Fan,"[2, 4]","I can't help but say Charlize's effort alone at portraying America's female serial killer Aileen Wuarnos, is worth the five stars. But the movie was sad to me. You can't help but feel sympathy for alieen in the film and real life. By the way, they wrote the movie way before Aileen's confessions that she made up the stories about her being raped and attacked, and they had already wrote it into the movie. Also, a while ago I was at a hotel and there was nothing on except a documentary about Aileen, and I watched it and I couldn't help but feel sympatthy for her. It's very easy to say she deserved to be executed, for her cold blooded murders. Towards the end, the interviews showed her paranoid delusions, and she believed they put camaras in her cell, and she kept saying ""it's all a conspiracy, they are now controlling my brain waves and making me ill."" Those are ramblings of a skitsophrenic. Lets not forget her police conspiracy theory. How they made her a killer by not catching her even when she had a record and left her fingerprints everywhere. And her detailed self defense story raises serious question about her mental health. Like how he put alcohol on her after he raped her. It was all lies. She clearly had a mental illness that was probably not overlooked but rather ignored. And at the end of the documentary, they played this song that she wanted played at her wake, by natalie merchant. I forget the title but it went ""I walked these streets in a spectacle of wealth and poverty.."" I don't think it's wrong to feel sympathy for sick people, and she did do a terrible thing, and I'm not sure if executing a mentally insane person was the solution which is also what the interviewer said after they excuted her in 2002 i think it was. She also said that when the ""rock hits us in the future"" she will be riding on the rock in a space ship or something weird along those lines. Obviously, that is not a stable person talking, and her laugh was high pitched like a witch. No doubt about giving me the creeps, but if you heard her life growing up, her mom abandoned her, she was sleeping on the streets, having to have sex for money to buy food. It's not an excuse, but how we grow up, shapes our adult characters teremendously. I am not condoning turning to homicide just because you had a hard life. Alot of us have had tough times. But even her mother said she suffered brain damage when she was born, when she was giving birth to her, she went without oxygyn for too long. Next, her lover betrayed her, which of course is the right thing (turning her in). But all her life, no one loved her it seems. Every person she trusted either betrayed her or abandoned her. We don't even know if Alieen felt remorse or not for killing those men. In the film, aileen cried before shooting that guy who begged for his life and pleeded to her how he had children and a wife. I just think she was mentally disturbed and couldnt help it. Even good people turn bad. You'd have to know your psychology to understand, and she even had a relationship with selby and took care of her girl, so if she was able to love her, she isnt completely cold blooded and heartless. People can kill and feel remorse. I just think it's a chemical imbalance or brain damage. There's a difference between killing and enjoying it, and killing on impulse and being unable to control yourself.

She is able to take the audience with her through a serial killer's tragic life, showing us not only Aileen Wuornos as the perpetrator of horrific murders, but Aileen Wuornos as a tragic victim.  Ms. Theron is more than believable.  She is downright astounding.The movie is tragic on many levels, brilliantly showing us the devastating effects of childhood abuse, homelessness, alcoholism, prostitution, rape,  violence, and the ultimate betrayal.  It's not a happy movie, but it's an important one.Charlize does indeed show us how talented she truly is.  She brilliantly conveys not just anger and rage, but vulnerability, fear, hope, love, desperation and complete dejection. I too saw this as a love story.  A desperate attempt at some kind of normalcy in a life that had been full of dysfunction and abuse.Ms. Theron, YOU are my new hero.  You kept a real person real.  So often, actors who portray real people end up doing sad charicatures of them instead, leaving the audience empty and embarrassed for them.  Not so here. This was played pitch perfect.  Bravo to you Charlize.  Start writing your Oscar acceptance speech.A few more words:  Christina Ricci is no slouch in this movie either.  They play off each other wonderfully. She provides a subtlety in contrast to Theron's in your face character. I read somewhere that Patty Jenkins saw Charlize Theron in ""Devil's Advocate"" one night and immediately knew she was the one to play Aileen.  If her instincts stay as sharp as that, she will have a very successful film making career. BR>Favorite scenes:  the vulnerability Charlize Theron shows when she is sitting on the bed in her bath towel and finally gets up the guts to verbalize her feelings to Selby.  Incredible.Also, the scene where she is sitting on the couch rationalizing to Selby why she kills. Absolutely Perfect.See this movie.A word of warning though: this movie stayed with me for DAYS.

It's the story of a lost, tortured soul who was certainly ""walking wounded"". She was a serial killer & by all accounts only the first killing was justified & the lowlife deserved his fate. The film tells the story of Aileen (Lee) Wuornos without justifying what she did. The viewer actually gets to know her as a human being & I sympathized with her to a degree. It's the humanization of her that made me sympathize with her. Otherwise, she'd just be another nut-job/hooker/murderer who also got what she deserved. There are some insights into her here & there in the film (molested as a child, raped by a family ""friend"", beaten by her father who later committed suicide, discarded by her siblings, became a prostitute at 13 to survive, battered by partners & cops, alcoholism etc.) that make you feel that this somewhat powerless & uneducated woman actually became addicted to killing once she started because it was a release of anger & hatred that had built up inside of her for so many years. I also felt sympathy for her because she wanted to ""go straight"" & work but she set her sights too high & was knocked down once again. Granted, the attempt to straighten her life out was mostly out of fear of being caught after she killed the first guy in self defense, but she also loved Selby & possibly wanted more ""nomalcy"" for them as a couple in that respect as well. I know the movie takes liberties with some facts.

But for some people she was the real monster, not the victims she murdered when she was alive.The story began with a picture of Aileen Wuornos, sitting under the bridge with a gun in her hand, in the most lowest point of her life, where she was completely lost & feeling hopeless. With a monologue for the insights of the history of her life, it rewinds back to a young lesbian, who was taking her first steps to come out from the closet - regardless how her family objections, named Selby. Selby was a shy, lonely lesbian, struggling to find a perfect start to get a compainion, I guess, and decided to go to a gay bar to try her chances. And there, she met the pathetic, messed up looking blonde woman, who was a bit of homophobic at first, who introduced herself as Aileen.After spending time together, Selby & Aileen got emotionally attracted and Aileen decided she would get some money for their next date by hooking bit earlier that day so she could treat Selby. Unfortunately for her, she the last customer of the night, she met the most horrible man that would effect the rest of her life. She got beaten & rape not to forget, he almost killed her, if she wouldn't had escape the bondage he put her in when she was out, and killed her out of self defence.Honestly speaking, yes, she would have done better if reporting it to the police, but since she was a hooker, would she really had a chance in court? - but then again, I guess she loved Selby that much, she afraid, she might lose her if she didn't come for their date.So, this was the beginning mark of their field trip together escaping the authorities, and Aileen, despite people not giving her a chance to change her lifestyle with a legal job for a chance, more accurately kind of blew her off and humiliate her in the process as well - she went back hooking.But never did she realize, the experience with the guy who she killed once, left her with a phobia. A foreplay reminded her of him and fear crept up, scared that this guy is just the same with the guy she murdered. That he might kill her too. So she killed her first 'innocent' victim - I say 'innocent' since he was married and still went out to get a hooker (seriously what kind of man is that?) - she stole his money and car.Later on their misfit adventure, Selby - who I feel lazy and a golddigger - grew away from Aileen, decided to go out and be with another lesbian. Seriously, if that other lesbian didn't meet up with her old fling, Selby would had had broke up with Aileen and run off to her, but she didn't and Selby felt alone again, with her tail between her legs, cuddle with Aileen once more.Mostly at the end, Selby just betrayed Aileen - I guess she just wish to get a better looing lesbian gf than her in the inside - and turned Aileen in to the authorities to pointing guilty directions at her. And what I don't get is, Selby should had had gone spend time in prison too, but she didn't. She knew but she didn't spend time. Now that's a bit sad, and infuriating.Bottomline, this movie has open up a few cans of worms discussions about death penalty and murderers.

Charlize Theron portrays this broken existance PERFECTLY in a stunning performance for the usual beautiful Theron who uglied her face and her body to feel and look the part; it obviously worked. Every facial expression that Theron makes shows the pain and agony that this woman went through on a day to day basis. Christina Ricci plays Shelby, Aileen's lover who helps make her happy. The movie starts with a bang showing Aileen sitting by a highway ready to kill herself but it soon turns around into sort of a fiarytale for the two lovers Shelby and Aileen who run away together and plan to start a life together. Aileen continues prostituting herself until she becomes raped (which is a very hard scene to watch) and finds herself killing the man. This incident leads to more &quot;accidents&quot; where Theron shoots her customers for money until she starts to become recognized and taken into jail. Christina Ricci also gives a great performance as the confused girl who is almost forced to follow Aileen as she kills her way through life. Overall this movie isn't your perfect cinematic experiences and I probably would never watch it again but even so you leave the movie thinking &quot;Wow&quot;.

The film is well directed and has good acting.Subject-matter excluded, the film is a good character study.  By the end of the film, the audience can (if not accept) understand what factors in Aileen Wuornos' horrible life were responsible in turning her into a such a psychotic monster.  Being a low-end call girl walking the streets and the victim of many male creeps and perverts, its somewhat easy to see why she became a lesbian and a killer: not that this is any excuse for what she did.  The film actually wants to show how Wuornos' lover Selby (Christina Ricci) was encouraging her killing spree so that she could keep running from her relatives.

622586,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005JMUK,Only-A-Child,"[4, 6]","While IMHO ""Monster"" is an absolutely amazing film, it obviously is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But the only reasons for criticism are writer/director Patty Jenkins' exploitation of a real-life situation and the perception that serial killer Aileen is portrayed as more of a victim that those she murdered. While there is some logic to those arguments, I think Jenkins actually showed considerable restraint. Exploitation and character identification are inevitable in this type of story. It is more a question of degree-if you compare this to 1990's tearjerker ""Too Young to Die"" (starring Juliette Lewis in an almost identical story), Jenkins comes off as a model of objectivity and distanced perspective.What is most unique and compelling about ""Monster"" is that it is much more a love story than a thriller or a crime drama. The two main love scenes are absolutely riveting, with intensity levels higher than you are likely to find in any other film. ""Tide Is High"" and ""Crimson and Clover"" will never sound the same.One thing that works unexpectedly well is the incredible contrast between the two characters. Jenkins works hard to emphasize this, with camera shots that emphasize the physical size differences coupled with dialogue and behaviors that emphasize the contrasting personalities of this odd pair. Having Scott Wilson play the last murder victim is a homage to an earlier ""Mutt and Jeff"" pair of murderers, as he played Robert Blake's ""In Cold Blood"" sidekick.Although most of the critical acclaim has gone to Theron for her portrayal of Aileen, I think that a lot of the credit for Theron's masterful performance should go to Ricci's subtle and nuanced portrayal of Selby. Watch Ricci's eyes in all her reaction shots, it is as close to acting for the camera perfection as you are likely to ever see.If you really enjoyed Theron's incredible transformation from her typical hot starlet to this gritty prostitute role, then check out Catherine Deneuve in ""Repulsion"" (1965) and ""Belle de jour"" (1967). While not as physically extreme as Theron's transformation, Deneuve's two characters are equally hard to reconcile as being played by the same actress. Yet another acting for the camera marvel, as wardrobe, makeup, and hair-styling combine with behaviors and speech to effect an amazing range between two characters played by the same actress.Then again, what do I know?

622591,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B00005JMUK,Paul McGrath,"[19, 38]","Eee-haw, another serial murderer movie.  How exciting.  How unusual.  This time, the killer is a female prostitute.  She kills prospective johns so she can support her new girlfriend.  She's been treated pretty badly over the years and has been ""hooking"" since the age of thirteen, so it's pretty easy to see how society has made her so unhappy.  Most of the johns are pretty mean guys but what sets her over the edge is one fellow who brutalizes her and probably would have killed her.  Instead, she kills him.  She shoots him about ten times in his chest, and he really deserved it, the brute.Then there's another john who turns out to be kind of shy and nervous around her so she doesn't kill him.  See, somewhere in there she really has a heart of gold.  But then she turns around and knocks off a guy who was only trying to help her.  Although she feels guilty about this, we now know that she's really a bad person after all.  See, we sympathize with her but we also are shown--no doubt about it--that killing people is a bad, bad thing.  Moral ambiguity and all that.  It's very thought-provoking.The usually beautiful Charlize Theron plays the murderous hooker.  Because she's usually beautiful and because she's made up to look real ugly in the movie it was pretty easy to predict that she'd win some kind of an award, and, of course, she did.  Except maybe you kind of wonder why any john in the world would ever want to have a date with someone so truly awful-looking, as she flings her stringy hair back over her head and butchily lights a cigarette.  She's about as alluring as the Bronx Zoo orangutan.Christina Ricci is also very good as the little girl who just wants to be gay in the mean old society that doesn't accept her completely normal and totally understandable lifestyle.  We get to see her making out with her new friend, which is an important career stepping-stone for both actresses, in that they've now completed the obligatory Hollywood two-pretty-girls-making-out scene, which of course also proves that they are great actresses.  Like her new found friend, her character likes to hang around in divey bars and smoke and drink and curse.  Which would be just dandy except that these jaunty little barroom forays are being financed by her friend's murder spree which after a while kind of makes her nervous.""You just can't go around KILLING people,"" she says, at some point, which seems to be a fairly reasonable sentiment with which most moviegoers would probably find themselves agreeing.All in all it's just a terribly delightful film.

Theron's performance is nothing short of astonishing here. She was clearly so consumed by this real life character she was playing that it is absolutely terrifying to see how good she was playing this woman. Christiana Ricci also gives an unforgettable performance as Selby, the young lesbian that Wuornos decides to have a gay affair with. Ricci is so good that if she had played this character to the same perfection in another film without being overshadowed by Theron's amazing performance she might have her self won a few awards for a deeply moving and believable performance. To play characters like these, especially if you are a heterosexual playing a homosexual, it must be painfully difficult, especially considering the demands made on the actors who had to engage is some very steamy sexual situations the script called for. Yet both actresses seemed so connected to their roles that it truly is incredible to see them together on screen producing two of the greatest performances in cinemas history. This film while extremely depressing in its unfortunate subject matter is an electrifying experience putting it bluntly. The film is very depressing in a unique way that may leave you saddened that some people on this earth could suffer and lose so much that they would resort to murder because of the horrible way their lives turned out.

Or that the former is from southern U.S.A and the latter from Northern Italy. And discount the forty years that seperate their appearances. And colour versus black and white. Whatever all these factors contribute to visionary status, clearly Bellocchio's,'Fists' has it and Jenkin's,'Monster' is void of it. I can only imagine that Bellochio's investment, his poetic grappling and empathy with his 'monster' is total. we feel the disturbance in every nuance of the film, its rhythms, lighting, angles, editing.

622601,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JMUK,RMurray847,"[2, 3]","MONSTER is an admirable movie, in the way that it makes our loyalties shift from character to character.  We are introduced right away to Aileen (Lee) [played by Charlize Theron...more on her later], the soon-to-be first ever female serial killer.  She is unattractive in a way that says ""I feel ugly on the inside, and that has bled into the outside,"" rather than, ""Because I was ugly outside, my soul has become ugly too.""  She is, quite obviously, rotten at the core.  She goes into a bar, mostly to escape the elements, and finds she is in a gay bar, and there she meets the character played by Christina Ricci, who is a not-quite-out-of-the-closet lesbian, making some very shy forays into the gay world. She is unattractively dressed and wearing a huge cast on her arm, so her desparation to connect makes her even more unappealing to the more happy-go-lucky crowd around.  She and Lee connect though, and a ""torrid"" affair develops.At first, Ricci (who lives in a tiny bedroom in the ultra-religious home of some family relatives she's been shipped off to) and Lee are a ""happy"" couple...crazy and irresponsible, but so glad to have made a connection with another human being and not to be found repulsive.  But soon, we see some ugliness coming out...unexpectedly, it comes from Ricci.  She is fascinated that Lee is a prostitute, and when Lee makes a (sad) effort to ""go straight,"" we are dismayed to see that Ricci seems to want Lee to continue her life as a prostitute.Then Lee (whom we have come to feel very sorry for at this point) is brutally attacked by a customer. She fights back and kills the man.  At this point, we are ready to cheer.  She is empowered and certainly seems to be within her rights to shoot the guy.  But when she returns to Ricci with the man's car, Ricci's greed comes out even more, and their love for each other begins to curdle.Lee begins to kill for less and less ""admirable"" reasons, and by the end of her spree, our feelings have flip-flopped for her.The movie is frank and brutal.  In the crowd I saw it in, there were plenty of shocked gasps...not from gore, but from the cold natured brutality.  Somehow, low-budget movies just make the grittiness of violent death feel more REAL.  Death  Be Not Proud, the quote goes, and it certainly isn't in this film!Yet underneath it, the movie is still structured something like a predicatable TV movie.  Cleaned up just a little and cast with a TV star instead of a movie star, and you could have a ""movie of the week."" Ultimately, the movie doesn't really have anything big or new to say.  We see how Lee became a serial killer, but this only sheds illumination on her, not on the world in general.  The story IS fascinating, no question, but at the end, you don't really leave the movie with a big feeling one way or another.Charlize Theron.  She has never been a favorite of mine. She is glamorous, and was okay in films like CIDER HOUSE RULES.  Often, though, she's little more than an adornment to the film, usually attached at the hip to a man.  Here, the male characters are VERY minor, and Theron spends most of her time on screen with Ricci.  Much has been made of her makeup, and it is stellar.  She is pretty much unrecognizable.  And  unlike, for example, Nichole Kidman in THE HOURS (remember the rubber nose?), Theron's makeup  is seamless.  But what she has done here is transformed herself. Her entire posture has been given over to the realities of her character. Not one bit of glamour is there to be found.  It is a brave performance, and one that should make it possible for her to find meatier roles.  But MONSTER'S BALL didn't help Halle Barry get ""juicy"" roles...just bigger paychecks.  We'll see what Theron's fate is.  I'm not entirely sure she should win the Oscar...as amazing as her performance is, there are some gradations lacking.

Charlize Theron has won the trophy hands-down with her portrayal of Florida's iron lady, serial killer Aileen Wuornos, in Patty Jenkins' amazing debut film Monster.Monster is a biopic about the last months of Wuornos' freedom, from the time of her meeting with ""Selby Wall"" (Christina Ricci; her real-life counterpart had a different name) until the time of her arrest and trial, during which Wuornos, a highway prostitute, killed seven johns. And that, in a nutshell, is the plot. As far as biopics go, really, there's not much here you haven't seen before plotwise.But the reason to see it, and I tell you you must see it now, is the ugly, painful depths of emotion to be found throughout the film. Theron's performance has already received lavish praise, all of it deserved. Less noted, but perhaps even finer, is the performance of Christina Ricci, whose character transforms from straight-up God-fearing closeted lesbian into a sneering carbon copy of Wuornos in subtle ways throughout the film, making the irony of the film's ending twist just a little further into the gut. Great supporting roles are also turned in by Bruce Dern and a number of cameos.Despite the questions raised by the film, another thing that makes it brilliant is its refusal to pander to any particular group, something which it could very easily have done on many levels. There's no gay-acceptance subtext. There's no anti-death-penalty subtext. There's the allegation, which I have never seen before in any media treatment of Wuornos, that the seven murders were not all in self defense. (About time, too.) There's brilliant and beautiful irony laced throughout the film, and all of it played perfectly. The film walks on the edges of a whole lot of knives, and the balancing act it performs is masterful.Roger Ebert called Monster the best film of 2003. I haven't seen quite as many movies as he has (oh, to have such a job), but of the lot that I've come across, I am more than happy to agree. Monster is a brilliant film, it is an important film, and it is a film you cannot see fast enough. Turn off the computer, get in your car, and go to the theater.

To maintain their life style and express her rage, Theron goes on a murderous rampage of robbery and murder, after killing a brutal rapist.

622607,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005JMUK,Robert Morris,"[7, 12]","Obviously, to praise Monster is not to condone the behavior of people such as Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) and Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) portrayed in this film. The same can also be said of other films such as In Cold Blood and Bonnie and Clyde. The film is an art form. To me at least, the objective as a reviewer is to comment as honestly and as thoughtfully as possible on any film as a work of art. Having recently seen Monster and then City of God, I view both as works of great art. Hence my Five Star rating of each. This review is composed prior to the announcement of those who are to receive Academy Awards. Either Theron or Diane Keaton would be a worthy recipient as best actress in a leading role but my preference is Theron. She commands our attention from her first to last appearance on screen. For me, she IS Wuornos. Moreover, I cannot recall another a character in another film whom she resembles. As portrayed by Theron, Wuornos is passionate, delusional, pathetic, frightening, vulnerable, and on occasion touching. I never expect to understand fully (or even partially) why Aileen Wuornos -- in real life, not in the film -- behaved as she did. Too much happened -- and did not happen -- in her life which is not revealed or even implied in this film. Who is the ""monster""? Is it Wuornos? Is it the society into which she was born and within which she evolved to womanhood? Whom to blame? What to blame? Should any blame be assigned, other than responsibility for the murders committed? To repeat, I do NOT condone the behavior portrayed in this film even as I admire so much what Patty Jenkins achieves as director as well as the achievements of her cast and crew. For 109 minutes, I was fully engaged in -- not merely watching -- human experiences wholly unrelated to anything I had ever experienced in my own life. Perhaps this is what a film makes possible...and a movie does not. Perhaps therein is the difference between art and artifact. As these comments no doubt suggest, I am still absorbing and digesting what I have seen.

622608,A1FPFWDC1ASYNJ,B00005JMUK,Rodrigo Llamozas,"[4, 6]","Based on the true story of Aileen Wournos, the first female serial killer in U.S. history, Monster deals with her life and how the situations she was subjected to ended up making her what she became. However, this is done in such a way as to not free Wournos of all the blame. Sure, she went through a lot and she didn't start up to become a serial killer, but she could, at one point, had stopped, yet she chose to continue that path.The film's intro quickly puts us up to date on who Aileen (Theron) is. She was a little girl who dreamed of big things, but who got lost along the way ending up hooking when she was thirteen years old. She keeps looking for her big break, that one opportunity, that one man who will see her for what she is and take her away from the life she knows and to something better.When we first meet Lee, as she likes to be called, she's about to kill herself, sitting in the rain under a highway bridge. For some reason, she decides against suicide and walks into a gay bar where she finds Selby Ward (Ricci), a young woman who's been sent by her parents to stay at some friends house and try to ""see the light"" and change her homosexual ways.They don't realize it at first, but this fortuitous meeting gives both women what they were looking for. They become fast friends and eventually lovers, even though Lee clearly indicates she's not a lesbian. Lee sees in Selby that person who will love her unconditionally and with whom it will be worthwhile to build a new life. Selby sees in Wournoss the first person who not only doesn't mind her sexual orientation, but also someone who will take care of her and provide for all the things she's ever wanted.While turning tricks one night to make money to be with Selby, Lee stumbles into a crazy man who rapes and tortures her, and who intends to kill her. She manages to free herself from the ropes that tie her hands and shoots her john in self defense. She takes his money and his car, and takes Selby away with her to star their new life. She decides to stop working as a prostitute and unsuccessfully tries to find an honest job, but she gets rejected every time. All the while, Selby is growing anxious because she wants to have all the things that Lee offered her, but since she's not working anymore, they start to run out of money. Defeated and not wanting to let Selby down, Lee decides to return to prostitution, but instead of turning tricks, she starts killing and robbing her clients.This goes on for a while, as their relationship starts to go sour. Lee is desperate to do whatever she needs to to keep Selby, while Selby, consciously or not, forces her to continue killing people.I won't spoil the ending if I tell you that Aileen eventually gets captured and sentenced to death row (this is a true story). The goal of the movie is to present Lee and Selby's relationship, and to raise the question of which one of the is the real monster. Is it Lee for killing all those people in cold blood? Is it Selby for making her continue? Is it society for making her what she became? You be the judge of that.What makes this film relevant is the acting. Most of the screen time is shared by Theron and Ricci and they both do wonderful jobs. Ricci is excellent as the naive, scared Selby, but the film belongs start to end to Theron. Her transformation into Wournos is truly amazing and goes far beyond the great makeup used to make her look like the real Lee.

622609,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JMUK,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","Despite the harsh judgment implied in the film's title - ""Monster""- Charlize Theron accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of turning a convicted serial killer into a sympathetic figure with whom we can identify and relate.  Aileen Wuomos, a hooker in the 1980's, was executed in Florida in 2002 for the premeditated murders of half a dozen or so unsuspecting ""johns"" with whom she came in contact.Writer/director Patty Jenkins sees Aileen more as a victim than as a perpetrator, an individual more sinned against than sinning.  We are told, from the outset, that Aileen grew up, like all of us, yearning for the good things in life: stability, love, a bit of fame, fun and fortune if they happened to come her way.  Unfortunately, due to an abusive and troubled family life, she ended up selling her body at the tender age of thirteen.  When we first encounter her in her 20's, Aileen is a beat up, down-on-her-luck prostitute with barely a penny to her name.  Lonely and desperate for companionship, she wanders into a gay bar one night and meets up with a shy young lesbian named Selby who is, herself, just looking for someone to connect with and talk to.  Though Aileen claims to be straight, she finds herself drawn to the genuine niceness and warmth emanating from Selby.  A tender relationship develops between the two, with Aileen believing she has finally found a person whom she can truly love and who will reciprocate that love.  Feeling herself on the road to better things, Aileen even attempts to give up prostitution and get a ""real"" job, but the legit world is a far from welcoming place for an untrained, uneducated woman whose social skills leave much to be desired.  Desperate to get money to support the two of them, Aileen returns to hooking.  When one of her johns rapes her in the woods, Aileen shoots him dead and steals his car.  The success of this endeavor leads Aileen to kill a succession of men whom she deems, for the most part, to be morally bankrupt, psychologically abusive scum.  It's when Selby discovers what Aileen is up to that the real trouble begins.Theron won an Oscar for her performance in this film, a complex piece of work that goes far beyond the surface aspects of the much-publicized changed appearance she underwent to approximate the bruised-up look of the actual Aileen.  Even without the de-glamorizing makeup job, Theron is in total command of the screen from first moment to last, showing us the multi-faceted nature of this hurting, troubled woman.  Christina Ricci, in a much less showy role, is equally impressive as Selby, providing an understated contrast to her far more flamboyant companion.  Together, these two fine actresses explore the complexities of both their characters and the relationship between them.  In a way, the film is really a love story between two lonely, troubled people who express that love in the only ways they know how.  Aileen goes on a murder spree to provide ""her girl"" with the comforts and necessities of life, while Selby, though at first disturbed by Aileen's homicidal tendencies, manages to come around to Aileen's way of thinking, knowing full well the grim alternative of a life lived unwanted and unloved.  There's an undercurrent of macabre humor flowing through the film as we watch Aileen heading out the door to kill another victim and steal another car every time the girls run a little short on spending money.  The nice thing about ""Monster"" is that we can't always sort out our feelings about these two women.  They both have characteristics that we simultaneously abhor and admire.  Aileen, despite the horrible acts of violence she commits, does appear to have a conscience of sorts, occasionally sparing a potential victim whom she believes doesn't ""deserve"" the fate she has mapped out for him.  Unlike Hannibal Lecter, Aileen does not murder out of madness, but rather out of practical necessity.  This makes her both easier and harder to identify with and understand than the average serial killer.  Selby, likewise, is a woman inexperienced in the ways of love who discovers that the person with whom she is trying to forge her first romantic relationship may, indeed, be a bit more than she bargained for.""Monster,"" though it isn't afraid to deal with the complexities of its characters and situations, sometimes feels a bit too one-sided in its presentation, a bit too sanitized and nonjudgmental for its own good.  Maybe because Aileen's victims tend to be pretty much ethical scumbags to begin with, it becomes easy for us to detach ourselves from what we are seeing and to overlook the horrendous moral implications of the acts she's committing.  Perhaps, Theron is a bit TOO successful at making her character sympathetic, of letting her off the hook a mite too easily.  That, in a lot of ways, may be the single most disturbing aspect of the film - that we in the audience don't feel more anger and outrage at the things she's doing.  That effect might be the result of either hidden genius or inadequate development on the part of the filmmaker.  Who knows, perhaps the title of the film is actually meant to be ironic.  I'll leave that up to you to decide.",4,3-dimensional portrait of a killer,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,5185,"['harsh', 'judgment', 'implied', 'film', 'title', 'Monster', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'well',

622610,A27XLRTG0ZIDNO,B00005JMUK,"Roy ""mmm_chicken""","[1, 1]","This is one of the most talked-about movies of the past few years. Sometimes when so many great things are said about a movie, it can't help but fall short when you actually watch it. Everything you've heard about this movie is true. Charlize Theron gives an excellent performance. Much has been made of her physical appearance in the movie, but I think the real achievement is the psychological transformation she underwent. She nails what this person really was: a product of her environment. Aileen's hopes and dreams were what every person wanted: success, fame, and true love. Her life was crap, and watching this movie, you can't help but feel sorry for her.The great thing about this movie is that it gets you to feel sorry for her without glorifying her crimes. She does many horrible things, and although she may have been abused as a child, her crimes were brutal and horrifying nonetheless. The fact that the movie really makes you see who this person really was- victim, dreamer, murderer- is what makes it a must-see. You see a real human being, not some cartoonish villain who runs around killing people.First and foremost, this is a love story. I really cared for Aileen and Selby as a couple, and that is what makes the ending so heartbreaking. You see all sides of the story and that isn't something all movies can pull off. What I also liked was that the relationship didn't seem gimmicky. When they kissed, it wasn't like &quot;Oh, 2 girls kissing!&quot;. It was about seeing 2 people connect in such an incredible way.I also think Christina Ricci did an underappreciated job as Selby. She just wanted to find happiness and saw the beauty in a woman who had had a crappy life. She may seem a little annoying in some parts of the movie, but I think it fits the part. Selby got caught up in this whirlwind of events and tried to deal with it as best as she could because she really did love Aileen.As for the DVD itself, there aren't many extras, but they are worth watching. There is an interview with writer/director Patty Jenkins and composer BT on how the score on this movie is essential to the impact this movie gives you. It is a little dull at times but it's ultimately insightful. There is also a featurette that shows how deeply Patty Jenkins and Charlize Theron invested themselves in this project. You also see that the movie was filmed on location in the actual places Aileen was at during this time in her life. You also learn that some of the extras in the movie were really there while all this happened. For instance, the bartender in the movie is the actual bartender who works at the bar Aileen frequented and actually knew her. There is also a film mixing demo that shows how elements like dialogue, music, and sound effects are woven to create a scene.I am glad I saw this movie. It is one that will stay with you long after you watch it. If you haven't yet watched this yet, then you should do so. It is disturbing, but it really makes you think. It's not a movie I will soon forget, that's for sure.",5,Something everyone should see,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,3039,"['one', 'most', 'talked-about', 'movies', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'things', 'are', 'said', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'short', 'when', 'actually', 'watch', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'movie', 'true', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'physical', 'appearance', 'movie', 'think', 'real', 'achievement', 'psychological', 'transformation', 'underwent', 'what', 'person', 'really', 'was', 'product', 'environment', 'Aileen', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'were', 'what', 'person', 'wanted', 'success', 'fame', 'true', 'love', 'life', 'was', 'crap', 'watching', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'her.The', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'feel', 'sorry', 'glorifying', 'crimes', 'many', 'horrible', 'things', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'abused', 'child', 'crimes', 'were', 'brutal', 'horrifying', 'nonetheless', 'fact', 'movie', 'really', 'see', 'who', 'person', 'really', 'was-', 'victim', 'dreamer', 'murderer-', 'what', 'must-see', 'see', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'not', 'cartoonish', 'villain', 'who', 'killing', 'people.First', 'foremost', 'love', 'story', 'really', 'cared', 'Aileen', 'Selby', 'couple', 'ending', 'so', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'sides', 'story', ""n't"", 'something', 'movies', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'What', 'also', 'liked', 'was', 'relationship', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'gimmicky', 'When', 'kissed', 'was', ""n't"", 'like', 'quot', 'Oh', '2', 'girls', 'kissing', 'quot', 'was', 'seeing', '2', 'people', 'connect', 'such', 'incredible', 'way.I', 'also', 'think', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'did', 'underappreciated', 'job', 'Selby', 'just', 'wanted', 'find', 'happiness', 'saw', 'beauty', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'had', 'crappy', 'life', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'annoying', 'parts', 'movie', 'think', 'part', 'Selby', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'whirlwind', 'events', 'tried', 'deal', 'as', 'best', 'could', 'because', 'really', 'did', 'love', 'Aileen.As', 'DVD', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'extras', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'interview', 'writer/director', 'Patty', 'Jenkins', 'composer', 'BT', 'how', 'score', 'movie', 'essential', 'impact', 'movie', 'little', 'dull', 'times', 'ultimately', 'insightful', 'also', 'featurette', 'how', 'deeply', 'Patty', 'Jenkins', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'invested', 'project', 'also', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'actual', 'places', 'Aileen', 'was', 'time', 'life', 'also', 'learn', 'extras', 'movie', 'were', 'really', 'happened', 'instance', 'bartender', 'movie', 'actual', 'bartender', 'who', 'bar', 'Aileen', 'frequented', 'actually', 'knew', 'also', 'film', 'mixing', 'demo', 'how', 'elements', 'dialogue', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'woven', 'create', 'scene.I', 'am', 'glad', 'saw', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'watch', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'watched', 'yet', 'then', 'should', 'do', 'so', 'disturbing', 'really', 'think', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'soon', 'forget', 'sure']",Monster

The acting is excellent.  However, the scenery, costumes and music are mediocre.  The film offers no comic relief. To its credit, the movie does not glamorize crime, but starkly portrays the bleak existence of those on the run. The title MONSTER is provocative. She did not torment her victims or even scare them.

622617,APEJ4UN2JQNSN,B00005JMUK,"Sasa Husaric ""sasa28""","[3, 4]","The movie script is based on a true story about Aileen ""Lee"" Wuornos (Charlize Theron), a prostitute who killed her johns and stole their money. She did it because she wanted to support her lesbian lover Selby (Christina Ricci). The film starts with their chance meeting in a bar Aileen has entered not knowing it is a gay/lesbian hangout. Selby offers Aileen to spend the night in her bed where she is discovered by her guardian Donna. They arrange a meeting the following night but Aileen is late. She was brutally raped and in self defense kills her assailant and takes his car and money. The rape scene is very disturbing and difficult to watch. Theron excels in the following scene where she murders the rapist. Particularly memorable is the scream she releases at the end, right before she looses consciousness. Afterwards Aileen still manages to meet with Selby and offers to take care of her. The two of them run away and make some motel room their home.Soon after the money runs out and Aileen tries to earn some and disgusted by her last john, decides to leave prostitution. This is the weakest part of the movie. Aileen tries to get a regular job and is turned down on many occasions. She even tries to get a job as a secretary at a lawyer's office. I'm not sure what was the point of those scenes. If the author tried to build some kind of sympathy in the viewers for Aileen she failed because in some scenes she looks almost comical and I'm sure that was not Patty Jenkins intention. After her last job interview, with the lawyer, she is taken away by a policeman who knows she is a prostitute.Aileen then realizes that her only option is prostitution and she takes to the highway again. The following scene in which she realizes that she can repeat the murder is the most memorable in the movie. The performance of Theron is simply brilliant as her eyes and body language shows the conflict, realization and finally the decision to commit another murder. This time Aileen does it much easier and shows less remorse.The romance between Aileen and Selby suffers when Selby starts going out and meeting new lesbian friends. Aileen is left on the side to watch but comes to term with the situation. Ricci portrays Selby very well as a spoiled and weak teenager trying to fight for her life choices. Her performance is good but never matches Theron.Aileen continues to kill her johns and provides for Selby but makes a fatal mistake when she kills a police officer which offered to help her. Selby has a car accident in one of the stolen cars and they are seen together by an elderly couple. Police starts to tighten the noose around them and releases their sketches on TV. Aileen realizes that they are going to be caught and sends Selby to her father. She is then caught and Selby is a star witness in her trial. Aileen is sentenced to death and executed after spending 12 years on death row.The movie is presented in 1,85:1 widescreen. Picture quality is very good with well defined color and no visible digital artifacts. I was a bit disappointed with sound quality. Even though there is 5.1 DTS mix available as an option the sound is sometimes poorly mixed. In some scenes it is difficult to follow the dialogue because it is obscured by music and sound effects.The special features include:Featurette This is a 16 minute Making of ""Monster"" documentary which features interviews with Charlize Theron and Patty Jenkins. Theron talks about a research trip she took with Patty Jenkins while preparing for the role. She visited some of the places where Aileen lived and spent her time. They talk how they read her letters which she wrote in the last years of her life and talked with her childhood friend. The there is a part about the makeup where we see a bit of work necessary to transform Theron into Aileen. We get a short glimpse at working on location and see some of the creative process Charlize Theron used in creating the character of Aileen. One interesting line Theron says in the interview: ""There is no way to get the story right, because there is so much happening in a persons life that it is impossible."" That is true, and that is why I don't like ""based on a true story"" movies, because they are never right.Theatrical TrailerInternational TrailerMonster ""Surrounded"" is a brief bit about surround mixing of the sound and the score for the movie.Film Mixing Demo This is an interesting interactive demo where you can isolate or mix sound effect and dialogues from some scenes in the movie. It is interesting but with no long term value since it quickly becomes boring. Also, it feels like it doesn't belong to a DVD with this sort of movie. It would be a nice edition to a movie like ""Monsters inc"" but here it just seems out of place.Interview With Patty Jenkins & BT This is a longer documentary about the evolution of a musical score for the movie. BT is a young composer who made his name in ""Fast and Furious"" movie and was a bit of a surprise for this kind of movie but in my opinion it turned out great. The score is very good and reflects the mood of the movie but it is a shame that it is sometimes too loud and obscures the dialogue.This is a very good movie but it is nowhere near the five star rating. It is closer to three stars but the amazing performance of Charlize Theron earns the fourth star. The Oscar is well deserved. Even though her face is filled with makeup and prosthetics she manages to portray all the emotions the character is experiencing. The makeup team led by Toni G (Dawn of the Dead, Planet of the Apes) also deserves a big applause for their work. Her performance is a great example of total immersion in the role. She had to gain almost 30 pounds to give her the required look.The biggest problem of the movie is its apologetic story toward the main character. The movie is full of references to Aileen's hard life and the abuse she suffered as a child. But hard life is no excuse for murder. Half the population of the planet would be murderers if it was so. The script is based on the stories Aileen told her bunkmate in prison. But are those stories true or are they the product of a deranged mind of a convicted killer, we will never know. So this story is one dimensional, from a point of view of a killer. There is no mention of the suffering she caused by killing those men, the loss their families had to endure. Her first victim, the rapist is a despicable human being but, what are his reasons to act that way. Did he had a hard life as well?",4,Oscar was well deserved,1097625600,"10 13, 2004",2004,6520,"['movie', 'script', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Aileen', 'Lee', 'Wuornos', 'Charlize', 'Theron',

622619,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,B00005JMUK,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[16, 19]","Monster is based on the true story of female serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a common prostitute that left a string of dead Johns in her wake.  Aileen (Lee) is on the verge of taking her own life when she meets up with Selby, a lesbian who is looking for companionship.  Selby gets Lee to talk, and they agree to meet again the next night.  Lee needs money, so she takes to the streets to make some cash.Her last John brutally beats and rapes her, and in an act of (what seemed to be) self-defense, Lee shoots him to save her own life.  Selby and Lee hit it off and decide to set up house together, each having their own ideal of what 'a real life' should entail.  While Lee believes that giving up hooking and finding a real job is the key to her new life, Selby is too dependent to go out and get herself a job, therefore remaining reliant on Lee's income as a prostitute.  Life does not stay peachy for the new lovers, and after many heart-breaking rejections from the job market, Lee returns to hooking in order to feed her and Selby.Whether Lee had simply had enough of prostitution, or whether the last brutal John soured her, or simply the idea that she had gotten away with it once, Lee adds a new twist to her hooking schema; murder.Monster is not a fast paced story of the police investigation hurdling towards finding a killer, but the horrifically commonplace lives of two women who want more out of life but can't seem to find their way out of the trenches.  It didn't strike me as 'what would you do for love' type of story either, simply a deviant's twisted mentality of right and wrong.  It is a story of the human inside the animal, even a human as alien as Lee was, and the presentation those animals will make to remain human as long as they can.Get ready to see the performance of a lifetime from previously uncelebrated actress Charlize Theron.  She *should* have won the award for her amazing performance in Monster, never again will you see her as a 'blah' or 'so-so' actress.  She immersed herself so deeply into the role that she became almost unrecognizable as the Charlize you have seen before.  The talk, the walk, the mannerisms, are all portrayed with a natural flow, you simply will not believe how good she is in this movie.Special mentions go out to Christina Ricci (Selby) and Bruce Dern (Thomas) for their stellar performances also.  Director Patty Jenkins receives a tip from my hat also, for finding the human inside Aileen Wuornos and bringing it to the screen.  In the featurette, Patty mentions that Lee's behavior wasn't about strength or weakness, but about damage, and she managed to highlight this in the film.I'm not usually a big fan of Special Features, but you absolutely MUST watch the featurette, where it shows the work behind the scenes and how they transformed Charlize Theron into Aileen Wuornos.  It's not just seeing the make up applied, but watching her mannerisms change as she imbeds herself into the role.Monster is a superb movie, an emotional killer, which will leave you full of both pity and rage at what becomes of those who society turns their polite cheek away from.  I highly recommend Monster as a 'buy' rather than 'rent' DVD.

622620,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JMUK,Scott Schiefelbein,"[7, 10]","Charlize Theron burst on the movie scene in the usual ""starlet"" fashion, sexing up the big screen in such movies as ""Two Days in the Valley"" and ""The Devil's Advocate.""  Her sex appeal was undeniable, and for those who had the patience to look closer at those lightweight films, her acting was generally good.What a difference a role can make!!!!  Theron virtually disappears into her role as Aileen Wuorno, ""America's First Female Serial Killer,"" in Patty Jenkins' ""Monster.""  While much has been made of the superficial aspects of the role (such as Theron's much-publicized weight gain and harsh, gritty make-up), Theron mastered the more difficult job of embodying the mannerisms and expressions of a woman who never really had a shot at life.  A grim demeanor that occasionally melts into pure happiness, self-conscious arm gestures and hair adjustments that occasionally morph into unconscious pleasure, and a stance that goes from awkward confusion to empowered confidence -- Theron has all these down cold, so much so that you're not even aware of an actress being on screen -- you're watching Aileen Wuorno.Aileen Wuorno, according to the film, was a cipher, a nobody condemned to a life of prostitution by circumstance and indifference.  A lesser movie would have found excuses for her nefarious deeds, and while ""Monster"" shows that there may have been some rationale behind Aileen's killings, there is no justification.Aileen is down to her last $5 and is making her peace with God when she runs into Selby (Christina Ricci, in a wonderful performance), a naive young gal exiled to relatives in Daytona Beach by her Iowa family so she can be ""cured"" over her lesbianism.  These two desperate souls soon develop a tight bond, and we get the sense that the romantic ""couples-skate"" at the roller rink is the first moment of pure peace and joy these two have experienced in quite some time.  Watch Theron's furious, hostile face melt as she sees something in Sel's eyes that she never expected -- acceptance.With no skills but with a reproductive system, Aileen has turned to life as a highway prostitute.  Her first murder is pure self-defense, but as we watch her pump extra bullets into the dead body of her attacker, we see the vast reserve of rage that has been built up inside this poor woman.  Aileen learns that murder can be more profitable that prostitution, and she rationalizes her early killings with the idea that the men she's killing are scum of the earth . . . an idea that the movie (correctly) refuses to sustain.Sel doesn't challenge Aileen, and is generally content to be kept by her new friend.  Watching Ms. Ricci inhabit this weak, lost character is a wonder, for after watching her in assertive, intelligent roles (""The Addams Family,"" ""The Opposite of Sex"") one could not imagine her a little cork bobbing along in someone else's wake.Eventually the murders catch up with the duo, and it is worth noting that Aileen's victims become less than less ""deserving"" of their fate (indeed, the last ""john"" she kills isn't a john at all, but a good samaritan at the wrong place at the wrong time).  But by this time, Aileen's horrorific life has scarred her beyond redemption, and a helping hand must be chopped off before it can touch her.Aileen's fate is a foregone conclusion - we all know how things turn out.  The power of ""Monster"" comes in the telling -- we may shed a tear at the end of ""Monster,"" but it's not because we know that a good woman is going to die.  It's because we have been reminded that there are people in this world whose lot in life is so pathetic that their Holy Grail is merely to live a hum-drum, normal life, and there is no chance in hell for that to ever happen.A solid movie from start to finish that is dominated by stellar acting (even the supporting actors are excellent), ""Monster"" is a must-see.  Put it in the category of movies like ""The Passion of the Christ,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Platoon,"" and ""The Accused"" -- these aren't the kinds of movies that you're going to pop into the DVD player every Friday night.

I guess it really boils down to taste but this movie didnt exactly do it for me. Thats not to say that Therons performance wasnt absolutley amazing, she does well and proves that shes not just a pretty face, Christina Ricci also does a great job as Selby. The film is based on the life of Aileen Wuronos(?) the first female serial killer who was executed in Florida in 2002(?). As we start off the film Theron is sitting under a bridge contemplating suicide, she goes into a gay bar, not really caring where she is heading, and buys a drink. After meeting Selby Wall, Aileen has a new motivation and believes she is in love with Wall. Another reviewer summed up my thoughts perfectly when they wrote ""I thought this was a film about a serial killer who happened to be a lesbian, not a lesbian who happened to be a serial killer"". I thought the film would be more focused on Aileens killings and life, then her relationship with Selby, also I really didnt find any chemistry between Aileen and Selby. Having said that this film is definetly not bad, its a well above average film, just really not my kind.

The film is such a dense, compelling story with amazing performances that it leaves you asking WHY its protagonist was driven to commit those highway murders..Not that ""Monster"" asks us to feel sorry for Wuornos, a Florida prostitute who killed seven men in the 1980s. The director asks only that we try to understand her. Theron's performance reveals a confused young woman who became a prostitute at 13 after being continually raped by her father's best friend and then being blamed and beaten by her father when he found out.As a movie that attempts to psychoanalyzes a serial killer's idiosynchracies, this movie is nowhere near some of the better classics (e.g., the Hannibal Lecter series, Midnight Cowboy, Badlands etc etc) but it is an interesting, well-made potrayal of the real-life Wuornos. I was intrigued to the point of googling for Wuronos and found that [...] has some good information that dispels the hyperbole surrounding this disturbed character.Theron's performance is of course brave and tortured. But I was even more impressed with Ricci, whose mannerisms aren't as noticeable. Her subtle performance as Wuornos' pathetically optimistic girlfriend comes closer to breaking the heart.Despite knowing the denouement -- Aileen Wuornos is such a known quantity that we do know where she's going (death row) -- it's the sense of utter unpredictability that makes ""Monster"" so gripping. Theron and Ricci are so absorbing, and Jenkins' direction so deft, that we root for history to take a turn it can't possibly take, and for Aileen and Selby to live happily ever.Highly recommended!",4,GRIPPING BIOPIC,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,1755,"['simply', 'potrait', 'posthumous', 'appeal', 'subject', 'convenient', 'enough', 'include', 'enough', 'violence', 'gore', 'make', 'Hollywood-smitten', 'fans', 'line', 'up', 'film', 'dense', 'compelling', 'story', 'amazing', 'performances', 'asking', 'WHY', 'protagonist', 'was', 'driven', 'commit', 'highway', 'murders..Not', 'Monster', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Wuornos', 'Florida', 'prostitute', 'who', 'killed', 'seven', 'men', '1980s', 'director', 'only', 'try', 'understand', 'Theron', 'performance', 'confused', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'became', 'prostitute', '13', 'being', 'continually', 'raped', 'father', 'best', 'friend', 'then', 'being', 'blamed', 'beaten', 'father', 'when', 'found', 'movie', 'psychoanalyzes', 'serial', 'killer', 'idiosynchracies', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'better', 'classics', 'e.g.', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'series', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'Badlands', 'etc', 'etc', 'interesting', 'well-made', 'potrayal', 'real-life', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'intrigued', 'point', 'googling', 'Wuronos', 'found', '[', ']', 'good', 'information', 'hyperbole', 'surrounding', 'disturbed', 'character.Theron', 'performance', 'course', 'brave', 'tortured', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'impressed', 'Ricci', 'mannerisms', 'are', ""n't"", 'noticeable', 'subtle', 'performance', 'Wuornos', 'pathetically', 'optimistic', 'girlfriend', 'closer', 'breaking', 'heart.Despite', 'knowing', 'denouement', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'such', 'known', 'quantity', 'do', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'death', 'row', 'sense', 'utter', 'unpredictability', 'Monster', 'so', 'gripping', 'Theron', 'Ricci', 'are', 'so', 'absorbing', 'Jenkins', 'direction', 'so', 'deft', 'root', 'history', 'take', 'turn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'take', 'Aileen', 'Selby', 'live', 'happily', 'ever.Highly', 'recommended']",Monster

Yes on all accounts!But above all the film contains some great &quot;bone deep&quot; performances by Oscar winner, Charlize Theron as serial killer Aileen Wuornos, Christina Ricci as her lover, Selby Wall, and I will admit that it was nice to see Bruce Dern back on the screen as Thomas, Aileen's benefactor of sorts.Charlize Theron's performance cuts right down to the bone from her portrayal of Aileen's last ditch effort and lifelong quest for love, fortune, and fame.  The film addresses Aileen's childhood trials, her longings, her unrealistic goals, her disappointments, her crimes, and ultimately, her execution.Charlize transforms herself into Aileen and has the uncanny ability to talk, walk and has Aileen's physical expressions down pat. You literally forget that you are watching the same beautiful, Charlize from &quot;Cider House Rules&quot;.However, what this film does NOT address is the majority of the true story of Aileen Wuornos' lifelong criminal past, her numerous arrests, a rap sheet a mile long and finally the trial &amp; unfortunate execution of Ms. Wuornos as we know it.That being said, overall, this film really moved me. The feeling of hopelessness and helplessness was overwhelming at times.Seeing Aileen FINALLY finding love and happiness with Selby, trying to clean up her act &amp; trying to be a productive citizen, whatever miserable attempts were made by her, they WERE made, nonetheless. I really believe that once she found Selby she tried to leave the life she had known for something better.  It's just that she didn't even know WHERE to find it.Aileen was a mentally sick human being in need of something SHE wasn't even aware of. A product of the world and of the system that so many children and adults fall in. After Aileen's rape and the first killing (self defense, no doubt) she really &quot;snapped&quot;.  That incident, above all others, was indeed the straw that broke the camel's back.  Aileen KNEW that she was doing wrong after the second killing.  She even handpicked her victims.  It certainly wasn't &quot;random&quot; nor self-defense in every killing. In one scene with a sweet, stuttering &quot;John&quot; (played by &quot;Heavy&quot; star, Pruitt Taylor Vince)Aileen chooses NOT to kill because she feels compassion for him.The true story of Aileen Wuornos is a depressing one, that's for sure but it will make you think about the world that we live in.Included on the DVD is a short featurette.  Not much information on the complete story of Aileen as you can tell the director wanted to make this film a compassionate one.

622626,A3PJXZOYC8026Z,B00005JMUK,Simon Crowe,"[12, 26]","MONSTER is the story Aileen Wournos, a Florida prostitute who committed several murders in the '80s and '90s, was caught, convicted, executed, and is now often referred as ""the first female serial killer"", as if she were a part of a Serial Killer Month.As Wournos, the beautiful Charlize Theron has recieved much acclaim, and a Golden Globe. While its true that Theron gets to play a much broader range of emotions than usual, and does so capably, the celebrated makeup she wears renders her face curiously inexpressive and almost caricature-like. I was always aware that I was watching someone act, rather than a person onscreen. To be fair, the amount of hype given to the ""uglying"" of Theron made it hard for me to lose myself in the movie.Much more troubling than the acting is the film's moral framework. The first murder Wournos commits is in self-defense (Lee Tergesen is very scary as her attacker). After that, she's never in a situation where she justifiably kills again, all the murders are executions. Apparently, Aileen and her sidekick/lover Selby (a dull Christina Ricci) need the money and cars they get from their victims, and hey, these guys are frequenting prostitutes anyway, so what's the big deal? Everything bad that Aileen does, we're led to believe, is due to the failings and the lusts of men. I'd be curious to know the source of the narration that Theron reads as Wournos. Is it derived from Wournos's statements? The naive voice over makes it sound like Aileen is someone for whom things just got a little bit out of hand, for whom the American Dream just didn't quite work out.Aileen, who was apparently sexually abused as a child, may have indeed been a victim, but she lost that status the minute she killed someone. Perhaps unintentionally, MONSTER softens her behavior and in a way tries to make it ordinary, as part of some kind of ""Nickel and Dimed""  rebellion (apologies to Barbara Ehrenreich). Aileen returns to hooking after failing to get a steady job due to lack of education and her criminal past. These scenes are played for low comedy and (combined with several scenes of Wournos' barroom rants) suggest there's some kind of class warfare at work. The issue of her sanity is ignored entirely.However much the movie might like us to think so, Aileen and Selby weren't outlaws, but a murderer and an accessory.",2,too long in the sun,1077062400,"02 18, 2004",2004,2352,"['MONSTER', 'story', 'Aileen', 'Wournos', 'Florida', 'prostitute', 'who', 'committed', 'several', 'murders', ""'80s"", ""'90s"", 'was', 'caught', 'convicted', 'executed', 'now', 'often', 'referred', 'first', 'female', 'serial', 'killer', 'were', 'part', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'Month.As', 'Wournos', 'beautiful', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'recieved', 'much', 'acclaim', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'true', 'Theron', 'play', 'much', 'broader', 'range', 'emotions', 'usual', 'so', 'capably', 'celebrated', 'makeup', 'renders', 'face', 'curiously', 'inexpressive', 'almost', 'caricature-like', 'was', 'always', 'aware', 'was', 'watching', 'someone', 'act', 'rather', 'person', 'onscreen', 'be', 'fair', 'amount', 'hype', 'given', 'uglying', 'Theron', 'made', 'hard', 'lose', 'movie.Much', 'more', 'troubling', 'acting', 'film', 'moral', 'framework', 'first', 'murder', 'Wournos', 'commits', 'self-defense', 'Lee', 'Tergesen', 'very', 'scary', 'attacker', 'never', 'situation', 'where', 'justifiably', 'again', 'murders', 'are', 'executions', 'Apparently', 'Aileen', 'sidekick/lover', 'Selby', 'dull', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'need', 'money', 'cars', 'get', 'victims', 'hey', 'guys', 'are', 'frequenting', 'prostitutes', 'anyway', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'Everything', 'bad', 'Aileen', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', 'due', 'failings', 'lusts', 'men', ""'d"", 'be', 'curious', 'know', 'source', 'narration', 'Theron', 'Wournos', 'derived', 'Wournos', 'statements', 'naive', 'voice', 'sound', 'Aileen', 'someone', 'whom', 'things', 'just', 'got', 'little', 'bit', 'hand', 'whom', 'American', 'Dream', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'out.Aileen', 'who', 'was', 'apparently', 'sexually', 'abused', 'child', 'may', 'have', 'indeed', 'been', 'victim', 'lost', 'status', 'minute', 'killed', 'someone', 'Perhaps', 'unintentionally', 'MONSTER', 'behavior', 'way', 'make', 'ordinary', 'part', 'kind', 'Nickel', 'Dimed', 'rebellion', 'apologies', 'Barbara', 'Ehrenreich', 'Aileen', 'returns', 'hooking', 'failing', 'get', 'steady', 'job', 'due', 'lack', 'education', 'criminal', 'past', 'scenes', 'are', 'played', 'low', 'comedy', 'combined', 'several', 'scenes', 'Wournos', 'barroom', 'rants', 'suggest', 'kind', 'class', 'warfare', 'work', 'issue', 'sanity', 'ignored', 'entirely.However', 'much', 'movie', 'might', 'like', 'think', 'so', 'Aileen', 'Selby', 'were', ""n't"", 'outlaws', 'murderer', 'accessory']",Monster

Based on the true story of Florida serial killer, Aileen Wournos,'Monster', takes you into what goes on in the life of a serial killer.  Theron's portrayal is remarkable. Christina Ricci, certainly has come a long way from 'Casper', while she plays Aileen's lesbian lover.  However, as dramatic and different this role may have been for Ricci, she could've done it a little better.  The role was obviously challenging for Theron, as seen in the DVD extra featurette.

After having seen interviews with the real Aileen Wuornos in Life and Death of a Serial Killer ( a film based on personal interviews with the real ""Monster"" ), I realize what an Outstanding performance Charlize Theron gave. Also, heads up to the make up artists for transforming beautiful Charlize into looking strikenly like Aileen. Charlize well deserves the award she won for her performance in this true story. What a perfect pick! I have to say also that the character of Selby ( played by Christina Ricci ) was well played. As everyone must know by now, this film is a true story about America's first female serial killer. Although the movie does not go back into Aileen's ( Lee ) childhood, the viewers can sense that this woman must have had a rough life. The movie starts where she meets Selby in a bar and they soon become lovers. What Selby doesn't know is that Lee is a killer.... at least not until later in the movie. Lee spent most of her time as a highway prostitute in Florida. After being picked up and raped by a John, she murdered him and stole his vehicle. This soon became a pattern for Lee and she had to kill over and over to get both cash and a new vehicle...... for she would get rid of the other vehicles soon after she took them so she wouldn't get caught in them. After wrecking a car with eyewitnesses at the scene, a sketch of Lee and Selby were put all over the news stations and Selby began to run scared. Lee got enough money for Selby to get on a bus and leave, while Lee remained there in Florida. The police eventually caught up with her and she was apprehended at her favorite local bar. Aileen was sentenced to death for the murder of 7 men. She was executed by lethal injection. If you like true stories and don't mind violence, I strongly recommend renting and buying this movie. I've seen alot of true stories made into movies but this one has to be one of the very best ever made.

As we see her slow desend into her murderous rampage, we also see what her life was.  Raped at the age of 8 by a family friend, forced into prostitution to make ends meet and then finally kill a john in self-defense.  We see that she had the chance to straighten up her life.  Unfortunately, she had no choice but to go back to the life she lived before because no one would give her the chance.Never have I seen a better performance in the last 40 years.  Her performance is one for the ages, right up there with Marlon Brando, Bette Davis, and Katherine Hepburn.  Charlize Theron is an amazingly beautiful actress.  The transformation into the character in this movie is incredible.  She is barely recognizable!

This film did not change my opinion of her, but it did succeed, however in painting a poignant picture of a human being transforming into a complete monster. To some it may seem that the makers of this are trying to convince the viewer that Wournos was a victim of circumstance, had no choice, but I don't think that is the case. The facts concerning Aileen's rampage of terror are portrayed with accuracy, her personality is captured by the brilliant Charlize Therzon. It is as if the viewer were a member of the jury, walking along with Aileen, being presented with the story firsthand, without the lawyers bickering back and forth, and not having to worry about undue sympathy being evoked.If this movie had been some feminist war-cry, then I, being the sentimental sucker that I am, most likely would have been convinced that Ailleen was misunderstood, etc. But that was not the case.

622633,A1SP75XHY3E02G,B00005JMUK,"S. Vandermyn ""Movie Lover""","[9, 11]","First off, if Charlize Theron had not won an Oscar for this performance, it would have been a HUGE injustice.  Charlize was absolutely brilliant as she took on this deeply emotional role by actually becoming Aileen Wuornos.What is most disturbing about this movie is the fact that the emotions of Wuornos are real.  Her life was completely wasted after a horrific childhood, being raped, giving birth to a child at 13 and finally resorting to prostitution in order to survive on the streets.  She eventually comes to meet Selby (a very loose portrayal of the actual girlfriend Tyria Moore) in a lesbian bar.  She becomes very agitated after being somewhat hit on by Selby.  Eventually, she finds that her attraction to Selby is strong and she enters into an affair with her.  Christina Ricci is equally amazing in her portrayal as the naive turned selfish Selby, firstly being innocent and just wanting to be with Aileen to becoming an incredibly selfish, self-centered girlfriend.Aileen wants a normal life for her and Selby and after being turned down many times at various job interviews for her lack of education and her mannerisms, she must reconsider her options.  Fade into Selby telling Lee she must go back to prostituting because their money is short and any prospects for going straight are slim to none.The first murder is highly disturbing.  This scene was incredibly emotional.  After being knocked out by her john, her back is completely cut and he pours rubbing alcohol all over her and she is screaming.  Her then rapes her and she manages to slip out of the rope tied around her wrists and she then committs her first murder.  Understandable this murder is in self-defense, but once she sees how easy it is to get free money and cars by robbing these men after she has taken their life, it seems like the easy way to live.  She then becomed the hunter, looking for men she could easily kill and take their possessions.  Many, if not all of the men she murders following the first, are not in any way deserving of being killed.  Even Wuornos herself has to make herself believe that these men are only out to hurt her and that they are deserving of their fate.  Tired of being used, abused, taken advantage of and treated horribly by the majority of people in her lifetime, she convinces herself that these men are the culprits, thus finding it easier for her to vent her frustrations by slaughtering these men.  Taking their belongings is just a bonus for her.Not only is Theron's visual transformation incredible but she actually becomes Wuornos.  The emotions are real and you find yourself wanting to comfort her, while at the same time being appalled by the monster that she truly is.  All she ever wanted from anyone was to be loved and unfortunately she went through life without ever being truly loved.This is a highly emotional movie that is very hard to get out of your head, even days after you've seen it.

622634,A5WLUF4G7W03U,B00005JMUK,"Swampsprite ""Swampy""","[1, 1]","When Aileen Wournos was at large, I was in my teens and living in Central Florida, following the story with sick fascination.  I grew up in Marion County, and the first thing I looked for when I saw this movie was accurate depiction of the area, accents, and overall look of the sets. Gotta say, I felt like I was home again.Charlize Theron goes through a major transformation for this movie, where she plays Central Florida serial killer, Aileen Wournos. Not only is the make up and the extra thirty pounds striking as she was uglied down for this role, but her mannerisms, accent and general attitude complete the illusion. Charlize looks so much like Aileen Wournos that when you put her picture next to the real killer's, the resemblance is so uncanny that it gives chills. She also looks a lot like James Hetfield of Metallica fame, but then, so did Aileen Wournos.Her performance is perfect, and Christina Ricci as her selfish, lesibian lover gives a performance that is also well worth watching. Ignorant of her lover's crimes, she pushes her to make more money for them, never realizing until much later that the money is coming from the dead men that are appearing all over Central Florida.Are we expected to feel sorry for Aileen Wournos now that we have the background on how and why she snapped and became this monster? Are we supposed to be sorry that we went to the electric chair? No. While this movie shows us that Aileen's first murder was in self defense, and the second murder was made easier by the post traumatic stress of her first experience, we also see that the other killings are completely calculated and her victims were generally innocent people. Briefly, we see her anguish at killing during an especially disturbing murder scene, but Wournos was not that sorry, so that scene doesn't inspire sympathy for her so much as it leaves a person feeling cold.I would have given this movie five stars except for one thing. The relationship she has with Shelby (Ricci) is too drawn out and slow in developing at first. Then, it seems to be more important than the murders, because we have more screen time with Theron and Ricci making out, arguing, or otherwise planning their next move than we do anything else, which seems to put the murders on the backburner.However, if you want disturbing non-fiction, this movie disturbs on two levels. The first is Charlize Theron herself. She is freakin' amazing. The second is the actual story.

622635,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B00005JMUK,Takis Tz.,"[2, 4]","The fact that Charlize Theron gives an unforgettable performance plus that ""Monster"" is very intimidating has been told in detail by most reviewers here, so instead, i'll take on the objections voiced by those who feel that this film is portraying a serial murderer in a way so she comes across as ""more human"".First off, some people claimed that the film is not accurate and that Aileen Wuornos (the real life killer) was nothing more than a cold blooded murderer. Aside from the first murder, which even in the evidence presented in court, was shown to have been committed in self defense after a savage rape, the film does show that eventually Wuornos killed for the money. Or did she?The reason i feel that this film does a good (but not quite great) job of going below the surface is because it shows us this woman's life without resorting to cheap sensationalism and without overstating or understating anything. This woman, like many 1000s, or even millions of people, basically live in that fringe of our society that resembles hell. She acquired street wits in the process but she also acquired brutal hopelessness, terminal despair, and ultimately distrust for anyone around her.When she gets in an affair with Selby, this relationship becomes to her the only way to exit the giant toilet bowl she virtually lives in. Problem was, like with many other things in life, she had no clue how. In her particular case, the fact that she wound up killing for a mere $200 shows what type of despair we're talking about. It's an old argument really, but one that wont go away no matter how hypocritically some of us choose to look at things, that is: anybody in our societies, ""good"" or ""bad"" is a direct product of that society. And that's undeniable, noone drops suddenly from the sky and lives amongst us.The character in ""Monster"" eventually comes to the point to treat people as she was treated. Yes, noone killed her physically (except the state in the end) but she had been morally and mentally ""murdered"" countless times before she turned into a murderer herself.Charlize Theron is incredible not because she took on 40 pounds and was made ugly to play this film, but because she stunningly managed to portray the mess in this woman's soul. That's the part of her acting that gave her the Oscar, which by the way - I felt- was one Oscar well deserved after a long, long time.But the same counts for the director of the film who manages to capture a life between rainy highways and back seats of cars, filthy apartments, sleazy bars with other hopeless characters, and ultimately a vast scape of nothingness. That's where the ""Monster"" was bred in and lived in.As for those who might've been offended with the film's language or the themes presented in it, well that's a true paradox, because that's like admitting that reality offends them. Sure, one can choose to avoid reality, but that never really works in the long run as ""what's there"" eventually -and always- catches up with us no matter what medium we use to avoid it.""Monster"" is a truly good film, and in my opinion, whatever objections can be raised are either trivial or hypocritical.C.Theron is not the only one giving a great performance by the way. Christina Ricci is up to par with her even if this goes ""unnoticed"" as Theron's role is inevitably overshadowing.A film that intimidates with its rawness and its ultra-realism, ""Monster"" is one that wont let you easily forget it.

The film details the torment Aileen went through as a young girl, feeling unloved and abused, to the point that she became a street walker. Instead of feeling hatred for Aileen we feel for her as the movie makes the viewer realize the anger and torment a person goes through to get to the point of becoming a prostitute. Even the fact that she becomes a killer still doesn't make us hate her, as there is one terrifying scene where she is raped and battered by a john in the isolated woods. In order to survive she kills this man, which is the starting off point of her murderous rampage. The film is a lesson for us all as we see how society can be insensitive and crue to people, and its that insensitivity that can eventually make monsters out of people. Theron won a well-deserved Academy Award for her portrayal; in the film she gained 30 pounds and wore fake teeth to alter her Hollywood glamorous look. Most critics, even Roger Ebert, stated that Theron gives the greatest performance of any actress in any year. In one word her portrayal is spellbinding.

622638,A26I5EYPB3HK3Y,B00005JMUK,"T. Gephart ""snarkylounge""","[9, 32]","Problems, problems, problems...if one were to know nothing of Aileen Wuornos and saw this R-rated Lifetime ""movie of the week"", they would feel sorry for her.It starts out as she sits under a freeway overpass contemplating suicide, only to release herself from her demons to spend her final ""earned"" 40 dollars. These demons are the first problem.She was abandoned by her mother, raped at an early age and had a bastard child in her early teens. She was a prostitute most of her life and she was in and out of jail on countless occasions for prostitution and armed robbery. She also had a history of public drunkeness followed by several assaults. Assaults that she made with her gun towards men. She had a failed marriage with an elderly man and suicide was also not a new thing to dwell in her thoughts. She tried on several occasions, even shooting herself in the stomach at one time. After all, fat, drunk, violent and stupid is, in fact, no way to go through life.This was not a charming person.If anyone were to look up her history, they would wonder how she even had the chance to commit murder as she should have been in jail long before her murder rap sheet.I actually got angry when I read her past. I do feel that our court system is somewhat responsible for the murders she committed. And now this film is trying to sell her as a person she wasn't.The movie actually plays her off as a drunk prostitute who was dealt a bad hand and could never catch a break. I do believe that the real Aileen was dealt a bad hand, but that doesn't mean she had to play the cards. There is nothing to feel sorry for here. And from frame one, that is exactly what the director went for. Pity.I would have accepted this at first, but she (the director was a woman) tried to sell that pity all the way to the end of the film. Even the title of ""Monster"" is cheaply sold off as she describes a scary amusement park ride she was afraid of as a child.I don't mean to sound male-chauvinistic by pointing out that the director was a woman, but let's face it... woman are more sympathetic towards human nature. I just think this particular woman should have done her homework.I also feel that this director seems to have something against men. With the exception of one man, her film has a slew of dirtbags. Granted, men who fork out 20 bucks for a hummer probably aren't in best character themselves, but do they really deserve death. Let's pity the drunk woman sociopath over the perverts. I think not.This story should not have started with a rape and a murder. This woman was a prostitute with a violent past. A past that the viewer knows nothing about.Now, it's my understanding that the director took this story from Aileen's words herself. Why? A tad bit of research would clearly show that this person is unstable and will probably not tell the truth. This isn't the homework I was talking about. This is like turning in someone else's term paper and pawning it off as your own, hoping that they did the work correctly. I feel she got her term paper from the D student.The thing that makes me most upset about this adaptation, is that it's floating around like a Indie film and yet it plays like Hollywood garbage. This should have been an intense character study, not a film in which Nancy McKeon could have starred in.Charlise Theron was over the top and looked like Eric Stoltz in ""Mask"" (coincidently, another Lifetime movie...yeah, I know...boo, hiss). I like Charlise, but I really hope she doesn't win the award for this. As for Christina Ricci, she looked and acted like a little naive boy. I don't believe her character in real life was that, shall we say, ""innocent"". I did notice that they changed her name completely, and the movie plays out like it took place over a course of a few weeks, when in fact their relationship lasted over 4 years. Also, during those 4 years, there were several accounts of trashing apartments and barfights involving both individuals. In the film, Ricci's character seems to have been afraid of her own shadow and incapable of any violence whatsoever.In closing, I actually gave this movie 3 stars because it is watchable and never boring.After my review, I dropped it down to 2 stars, because movie's like this are starting to really irritate me. There was a hell of a story here, and yet the director opted for pity over substance (in which this film had none). I'll save my 3 star review for the remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""... you know, the other ""based on true events"" movie released this year.It is really sad that a tag of ""based on real events"" can't live up to just that and let the average popcorn-slurping slob make up there own mind. Unfortunately, this director made up her own mind on exactly how she wanted us to feel before she made this movie.Someone, at that time, should have taken the project away from her.",2,"Come On

622642,AP9TSAQICVEVT,B00005JMUK,The Ion,"[1, 1]","Gritty tragic tale about the exploits of a female serial killer. The title of the movie is slightly ironic since this movie fills out the flesh and bones of what we have read in the papers and succeeds in granting her humanity. The performance of Charlise Theron as Aileen Wuornos is every bit as good as you have been lead to believe. Theron does not simply manage to look like Wuornos, with her big boned gangly stride and psychotic rage filled eyes (when she is angry) she also does a good job of describing her inner workings, her peculiar vulnerability and pain. We see Wuornos the prostitute, homeless friendless and aimless, then when she finally meets someone who actually seems interested in her friendship (a newly outed lesbian girl well played by Christina Ricci) she finally has something to lose. One night she is nearly raped and murdered by a sadistic 'customer', she just manages to get the upper hand and kills him. The film explains that from this point on she is finished with prostitution, yet she must still eat and her new young lover demands to be fed so she meets would be 'Johns' and sets about unleashing her long pent up rage upon them, one after another she kills them and steals their car and money. We get the impression that she is insane, unable to differentiate anymore between the violent attacker and the other johns, she lumps them all together and only once is she merciful in an encounter with a john, in all other cases they die regardless. When a customer calls himself 'daddy' during one such encounter she rounds on him, accusing him of paedophilia. Is she fully aware of what she is doing and cynically manipulating herself to believe they deserve to die in order for her to be able to justify their murders to herself? Or is she hopelessly insane? As the film nears the sad inevitable conclusion we see her killing (in coldest blood) a concerned kind man who only wanted to help her. It is to the credit of this film that the director doesnt make any moral judgements about Aileen Wuornos, we are allowed to feel sorry about the murders of (most) of her victims and yet we cannot help but to feel sympathy for Wuornos herself, the pain of living such a sad dissapointing life would be difficult for anyone to bear and stay sane.I have also viewed the documentary 'portrait of a serial killer' about Aileen Wuornos in prison, and a lawyers attempt to stop her from becoming another victim of the Bush familly. After viewing the interview with her it is plain to see that she is clearly stark raving mad, it would be impossible to fake such a display. It was cruel to incarcerate her without the medication she needed, even less humane to execute her in that condition, but good politics yes.",4,Touching tragic true life drama,1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,2735,"['Gritty', 'tragic', 'tale', 'exploits', 'female', 'serial', 'killer', 'title', 'movie', 'slightly', 'ironic', 'movie', 'out', 'flesh', 'bones', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'papers', 'granting', 'humanity', 'performance', 'Charlise', 'Theron', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'have', 'been', 'lead', 'believe', 'Theron', 'not', 'simply', 'manage', 'look', 'Wuornos', 'big', 'boned', 'gangly', 'stride', 'psychotic', 'rage', 'filled', 'eyes', 'when', 'angry', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'describing', 'inner', 'workings', 'peculiar', 'vulnerability', 'pain', 'see', 'prostitute', 'homeless', 'friendless', 'aimless', 'then', 'when', 'finally', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'interested', 'friendship', 'newly', 'outed', 'lesbian', 'girl', 'well', 'played', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'finally', 'something', 'lose', 'One', 'night', 'nearly', 'raped', 'murdered', 'sadistic', ""'customer"", 'just', 'get', 'upper', 'hand', 'film', 'point', 'finished', 'prostitution', 'must', 'still', 'eat', 'new', 'young', 'lover', 'demands', 'be', 'fed', 'so', 'meets', 'would', 'be', ""'Johns"", 'sets', 'unleashing', 'long', 'pent', 'up', 'rage', 'one', 'steals', 'car', 'money', 'get', 'impression', 'insane', 'unable', 'differentiate', 'anymore', 'violent', 'attacker', 'other', 'johns', 'lumps', 'together', 'only', 'once', 'merciful', 'encounter', 'john', 'other', 'cases', 'die', 'regardless', 'When', 'customer', ""'daddy"", 'one', 'such', 'encounter', 'accusing', 'paedophilia', 'fully', 'aware', 'what', 'doing', 'cynically', 'manipulating', 'believe', 'deserve', 'die', 'order', 'be', 'able', 'justify', 'murders', 'herself', 'hopelessly', 'insane', 'film', 'sad', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'see', 'killing', 'coldest', 'blood', 'concerned', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'wanted', 'help', 'credit', 'film', 'director', 'doesnt', 'make', 'moral', 'judgements', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'are', 'allowed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'murders', 'most', 'victims', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Wuornos', 'pain', 'living', 'such', 'sad', 'dissapointing', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'anyone', 'bear', 'stay', 'sane.I', 'have', 'also', 'viewed', 'documentary', ""'portrait"", 'serial', 'killer', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'prison', 'lawyers', 'attempt', 'stop', 'becoming', 'victim', 'Bush', 'familly', 'viewing', 'interview', 'plain', 'see', 'clearly', 'stark', 'raving', 'mad', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'fake', 'such', 'display', 'was', 'cruel', 'incarcerate', 'medication', 'needed', 'even', 'less', 'humane', 'execute', 'condition', 'good', 'politics', 'yes']",Monster

Instead for the entire film you are emmersed and witnessing a character come to life.  Not just because of the intense prostetics Charlize Theron had to wear but instead the startling performance she gives.Monster is the true story of the only known woman serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Ive seen many documentaries on this woman and every one portrays her as a cold blooded killer, the movie though tells the whole story from her point of view.  On the verge of suicide, Aileen meets her soul mate Selby, played by Christina Ricci in the performance of her career.  You see that Aileen wasn't just a murder who did for some sick unknown reason, but that she feels she is on a mission to rid the world of all skummy men who take advantage of woman.The most heartbreaking, and heart warming moments of the film are when Aileen decides to not prostitute herslef anymore, and go clean.  You see the hope she has for a real life with the love of her life at her side.  There are a number of very violent and graphic seens in this movie, which only adds to the dramatic tension.Director Patty Jenkins, atempts a first in cinema history, by showing a serial killer as not a cold blooded murderer.  Instead she surprises you by actually caring for the characters and even finding them funny at times.  Imagine trying to do that with Charles Manson.  Most credit though belongs to Charlize Theron, who i must admit surprised at her talent.  Who knew she was capable of something like this?  She gives one of the best performances of all time, and also gives true meaning to deserving the Oscar.DVD extras include a documentary on the film, with a few shots of the real Aileen in court.  It takes you through Charlize's day to day prostetic job.  Also includes theatrical trailers, and a few featurettes on the music, &amp; score of the film.

622647,A233QN6P2EEKPS,B00005JMUK,Tom Collier,"[1, 1]","The two main characters in Monster are people who will never touch happiness. They may have seen happy people, had enjoyable moments, and grasp what it may mean to be happy, but the harder they fight towards it, the further away they get from it.In one of the most dramatic and successful transformations in film history, Charlize Theron plays Aileen Wuornos, a short-tempered, ugly, slow-witted, pathetic prostitute. She is on the verge of suicide when she is hit on by Selby (Christina Ricci), a frumpy, weak willed lesbian. At first Aileen violently rejects Selby's advances, but before long they are making out in an alley behind the bar. Aileen probably isn't a lesbian, but she has been used, beaten, or raped by nearly every man she has ever known, so accepting the love of another woman isn't too hard.Of course, their relationship itself is hard, as neither has any money nor a place to go that would accept them. One night, a john ties up Aileen and begins to rape her, but she manages to grab the gun she carries and shoot her attacker dead. She ditches the body and swipes his car and money, and for a few days, her and Selby enjoy booze and a hotel room. Aileen dresses as nicely as she can and applies for a few secretary positions, though her complete lack of credentials or charm ensures that she can't get a job. Desperate to keep Selby around, she goes back to hooking, and before she knows it she has blown another one of her johns away, and with his money can continue being with Selby just a bit longer.Aileen keeps coming back to the house with new cars and more money than her tricks could provide, but Selby isn't the type to ask difficult questions. Aileen is surprised by how easy it is just to kill these men and empty their wallets; she has been abused by men, and now they are getting their just desserts. Aileen always talks to Selby with the conviction of someone who sees the light at the end of the tunnel, swearing that soon they can move somewhere nicer, eat at better restaurants, and inhabit that happy world the two of them have only seen through others. When Selby finds out exactly what Aileen is doing, she protests; shortly afterwards, Aileen returns home without as much money as expected, and Selby demands Aileen head right back out and score another car.Theron does an amazing job with Aileen, who comes across as truly despicable, yet with a desire for something better that is easy to relate to. Everything in her life has been terrible, and when she finally finds someone who makes her feel good, she can't help but promise the moon and then try her hardest to provide it. Aileen rarely sees anything as her fault, and maybe not everything is, though when she shoots a kind Christian man who offered her shelter at his family's house through the back of the head, childhood rape is a tough sell.Through voiceover, she tells us that people think she has taken the easy way out by being a hooker, but that she hasn't, as being a hooker is hard work. She may believe this, but it isn't so; by murdering these men, she is indeed taking the easy way out instead of improving herself the hard way, as is Selby for lapping up the promises this wretched creature flings out at her. Consistently, both Aileen and Selby have lived their lives in terrible circumstances, and look feverishly for the easiest way they can to get out.Monster is entertaining, sad, heart-breaking, and revolting. Entertaining because of its masterful performances and direction, sad because we know that the story is true, heart-breaking because we see the squalor in which its characters inhabit, and revolting as we see them murder in cold blood and then belligerently make excuses. Monster is one of the best films about a murderer ever made, revealing the human story of Aileen, and leaving no doubt that she turned out to be worse than those who wronged her.",4,Monster stunningly powerful study of a killer,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,3880,"['two', 'main', 'characters', 'Monster', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'touch', 'happiness', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'happy', 'people', 'had', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'grasp', 'what', 'may', 'mean', 'be', 'happy', 'harder', 'fight', 'towards', 'further', 'away', 'get', 'it.In', 'one', 'most', 'dramatic', 'successful', 'transformations', 'film', 'history', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'short-tempered', 'ugly', 'slow-witted', 'pathetic', 'prostitute', 'verge', 'suicide', 'when', 'hit', 'Selby', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'frumpy', 'weak', 'willed', 'lesbian', 'first', 'Aileen', 'violently', 'Selby', 'advances', 'long', 'are', 'making', 'out', 'alley', 'bar', 'Aileen', 'probably', ""n't"", 'lesbian', 'been', 'used', 'beaten', 'raped', 'nearly', 'man', 'ever', 'known', 'accepting', 'love', 'woman', ""n't"", 'too', 'hard.Of', 'course', 'relationship', 'hard', 'money', 'place', 'go', 'would', 'accept', 'One', 'night', 'john', 'up', 'Aileen', 'rape', 'grab', 'gun', 'attacker', 'dead', 'body', 'swipes', 'car', 'money', 'few', 'days', 'Selby', 'enjoy', 'booze', 'hotel', 'room', 'Aileen', 'dresses', 'as', 'nicely', 'can', 'applies', 'few', 'secretary', 'positions', 'complete', 'lack', 'credentials', 'charm', 'ensures', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'job', 'Desperate', 'keep', 'Selby', 'back', 'hooking', 'blown', 'one', 'johns', 'away', 'money', 'can', 'continue', 'being', 'Selby', 'just', 'bit', 'longer.Aileen', 'coming', 'back', 'house', 'new', 'cars', 'more', 'money', 'tricks', 'could', 'provide', 'Selby', ""n't"", 'type', 'ask', 'difficult', 'questions', 'Aileen', 'surprised', 'how', 'easy', 'just', 'kill', 'men', 'empty', 'wallets', 'been', 'abused', 'men', 'now', 'are', 'getting', 'just', 'desserts', 'Aileen', 'always', 'Selby', 'conviction', 'someone', 'who', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'swearing', 'soon', 'can', 'move', 'somewhere', 'nicer', 'eat', 'better', 'restaurants', 'inhabit', 'happy', 'world', 'two', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'others', 'When', 'Selby', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'Aileen', 'doing', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'Aileen', 'home', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'expected', 'Selby', 'demands', 'Aileen', 'head', 'right', 'back', 'score', 'car.Theron', 'amazing', 'job', 'Aileen', 'who', 'truly', 'despicable', 'yet', 'desire', 'something', 'better', 'easy', 'relate', 'Everything', 'life', 'been', 'terrible', 'when', 'finally', 'someone', 'who', 'feel', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'promise', 'moon', 'then', 'try', 'hardest', 'provide', 'Aileen', 'rarely', 'anything', 'fault', 'maybe', 'not', 'everything', 'when', 'shoots', 'kind', 'Christian', 'man', 'who', 'offered', 'shelter', 'family', 'house', 'back', 'head', 'childhood', 'rape', 'tough', 'sell.Through', 'voiceover', 'people', 'think', 'taken', 'easy', 'way', 'being', 'hooker', ""n't"", 'being', 'hooker', 'hard', 'work', 'may', 'believe', ""n't"", 'so', 'murdering', 'men', 'indeed', 'taking', 'easy', 'way', 'instead', 'improving', 'hard', 'way', 'Selby', 'lapping', 'up', 'promises', 'wretched', 'creature', 'out', 'Consistently', 'Aileen', 'Selby', 'have', 'lived', 'lives', 'terrible', 'circumstances', 'look', 'feverishly', 'easiest', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'out.Monster', 'entertaining', 'sad', 'heart-breaking', 'revolting', 'Entertaining', 'masterful', 'performances', 'direction', 'sad', 'know', 'story', 'true', 'heart-breaking', 'see', 'squalor', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'revolting', 'see', 'murder', 'cold', 'blood', 'then', 'belligerently', 'make', 'excuses', 'Monster', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'murderer', 'ever', 'made', 'revealing', 'human', 'story', 'Aileen', 'leaving', 'doubt', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'worse', 'who', 'wronged']",Monster

Wuornos had a difficult and cruel childhood plagued by abuse and drug use in Michigan. She became a prostitute by the age of thirteen, the same year she became pregnant. She eventually moved to Florida where she began earning a living as a highway prostitute--servicing the desires of semi-truck drivers. The tale focuses on the nine month period between 1989 and 1990, during which Wuornos had a lesbian relationship with a woman named Selby. And during that very same time, she also began murdering her clientele in order to get money without using sex. This turned the tables on a rather common phenomena of female highway prostitutes being the victims of serial killers--instead Wuornos, herself, carried out the deeds of a cold-blooded killer.

622649,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMUK,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","'Monster' is not the first film that feature the life of Aileen Woumos -- Jean Smart did her role in made-for-TV film 'Aileen Woumos: The True Story' in 1992 (which I have not seen), and director Nick Bloomfield made TWO documentaries 'Aileen Wuomos: The Selling of a Serial Killer' in 1993 and 'Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer' in 2004.  So, what makes her life so compelling in this morbid way?Though 'Monster' does not give the definite answer, it still attempts to shed a light on the life of this serial killer in terms of her relations to another woman named Selby (Christina Ricci).  As you know, Charlize Theron gives very convincing acting as Aileen who finds a hope of life in this lonely girl, which turns out short-lived and more pernicious than she at first imagined.The story is surprisingly simple.  Aileen meets Selby at a bar, and Selby, knowing that her relation with Aileen would be looked down as indecent by her father and relatives, keeps on meeting her, and fell for her.  Finally Selby leaves the home, and begins a new life with Aileen, but later she comes to realize that Aileen killed a guy, and she just cannot stop killing men, even the totally innocent ones.Don't try to seek 'truths' about the killer and her life.  The strength of 'Monster' lies more in its obviously fictionalized (so I believe) part of Aileen who seeks desperately something in life, than in the reveiled facts themselves, which the film hardly has.  The film leaves out many things -- such as Aileen's marriage, and at least one killing is depicted as self-defence (as the real Aileen claimed) -- but whether or not you trust that part, it's up to you.  Me?  Not at all.The unremarkable script (which is full of predictable turns) works simply because it is supported by two good acting from Theron and Ricci.  Though Theron underwent a physical change with make-ups and special diet, it is her performance that makes the film compelling.The film is at its best when it describes Aileen's incredibly naive outlook on life, which plays one of the basic part of the whole story.  The idea of showing that aspect of her is original, but otherwise the film itself is not as great as many critics' raving reviews would lead us to think.

Theron not only manages to completely change her looks but her entire persona, she becomes Wuornos, capturing all of the mannerisms and deep bedded anger that Wuornos exhibited during her trial. Theron's acting is fantastic and through her performance many questions are raised, some that will stay with you for awhile.Christina Ricci should not be ignored in her performance in this film either. She captures naive innocence in her role as Wuornos's girlfriend. Ricci's emotions are raw and she holds her own against Theron's brilliance.But this film is really more than just the acting; it is a statement about right and wrong and about the justice of our death penalty. I don't think anyone can walk away from this film and not feel that Wuornos might have deserved a different sentence. While I agree she was wrong to kill her victims I have to wonder what any normal woman might do under her circumstances. Rape is almost as brutal as death despite the lack of permanence. After seeing the life Wuornos had to live I became wracked with compassion for a woman with no place to turn. Was she right to kill? No! But at what point is a person a cold blooded murderer and at what point is she crushed by her circumstances. At some point blame needs to rest with the child abusers, rapists and sexual predators that helped to create Wuornos and others likely to come in her wake.

With a little help from the artists in make-up, she transforms herself into Aileen Wuornos, Daytona Beach prostitute turned serial killer (a true story; Wuornos was executed for seven murders in 2002 after spending 12 years on FLorida's death row). Christina Ricci is also brilliant as Wuornos' naive and vulnerable lesbian lover. There is little I can add to the comments of other viewers about the amazing quality of the acting, which extends beyond the protagonists to the talented men who play Wuornos' various ""johns."" Special kudos go to Marc Macaulay and Scott Wilson (who plays the last ""john"" with breathtaking poignance).The DVD also includes a very enlightening featurette on the making of the film, which I highly recommend, narrated chiefly by Theron and director/writer of the film, Patty Jenkins. I learned from watching this extra feature, for example, that the movie was shot on the actual sites where the real events took place and that Theron and Jenkins met and interviewed many acquaintances of Wuornos in the process. As both Theron and Jenkins explain, they came to understand that they could only tell a part of the horrifying story of Wuornos' evolution from abused and abandoned child to killer. To that end, the script is remarkable in conveying Wuornos' story with sympathy while not attempting to glorify or excuse her slide to the dark side. The events of her early life that damaged her so extensively are narrated indirectly through dialogue and description, which I think was a good choice, because we never come to feel that any one experience explains or justifies the monster she became.One of the best movies I've seen.",5,All-around brilliant,1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,1771,"['Charlize', 'Theron', 'widely', 'known', 'superb', 'film', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actress', 'little', 'help', 'artists', 'make-up', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'Daytona', 'Beach', 'prostitute', 'turned', 'serial', 'killer', 'true', 'story', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'executed', 'seven', 'murders', '2002', 'spending', '12', 'years', 'FLorida', 'death', 'row', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'also', 'brilliant', 'Wuornos', 'naive', 'vulnerable', 'lesbian', 'lover', 'little', 'can', 'add', 'comments', 'other', 'viewers', 'amazing', 'quality', 'acting', 'protagonists', 'talented', 'men', 'who', 'play', 'Wuornos', 'various', 'johns', 'Special', 'kudos', 'go', 'Marc', 'Macaulay', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'who', 'last', 'john', 'breathtaking', 'poignance', '.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'very', 'enlightening', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'narrated', 'chiefly', 'Theron', 'director/writer', 'film', 'Patty', 'Jenkins', 'learned', 'watching', 'extra', 'feature', 'example', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'actual', 'sites', 'where', 'real', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Theron', 'Jenkins', 'met', 'interviewed', 'many', 'acquaintances', 'Wuornos', 'process', 'Theron', 'Jenkins', 'explain', 'came', 'understand', 'could', 'only', 'tell', 'part', 'horrifying', 'story', 'Wuornos', 'evolution', 'abused', 'abandoned', 'child', 'killer', 'end', 'script', 'remarkable', 'conveying', 'Wuornos', 'story', 'sympathy', 'not', 'attempting', 'glorify', 'excuse', 'slide', 'dark', 'side', 'events', 'early', 'life', 'damaged', 'so', 'extensively', 'are', 'narrated', 'indirectly', 'dialogue', 'description', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'never', 'come', 'feel', 'one', 'experience', 'monster', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen']",Monster
622654,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B00005JMUK,Wesley Mullins,"[6, 12]","Monster tells the story of Aileen Wuornos , a vagabond prostitute and one of America's first female serial killers. The film picks up just before she begins the killing spree that claimed the lives of nine men, many clients of the enterprising lady-of-the-night, murdered in cars or deep in the woods where they were to partake in her services.The director of the film (Patty Jenkins) uses the life of Wournos to comment on what she sees as the evils of contemporary society. But the target of Jenkins's film is not the killer, but rather a society that the film suggests led Wuornos to commit her crimes. The true villains of the world (according to Jenkins) are not serial killers, but rather capitalism, patriarchy and homophobia. These are the true ""monsters"" of the film, as they are the real reason nine men died at the hands of our hero.OK, maybe calling her the film's ""hero"" is a bit of a stretch, but the film does work very hard trying to add humanity to a woman who (let me say this again) murdered nine men. Her childhood is sad, her dreams are shattered, and she can't get a real job because her only previous employment consisted of wanking winkies. Therefore, the only thing left for her to do is...start killing people.What I see as dangerous about this movie is that it is indeed based on a real woman and nearly all the facts in the film are true. But this film shows how a write/director can use facts to produce a thesis that doesn't necessarily grow naturally from the story itself. Many people will walk away from this film buying the ideas that drive the film, because (they will say) it is based on fact and must be true.In the hands of a less ""enlightened"" director, the film would portray a very different Aileen Wuornos.

The entire cast was magnificent, the film was shot exactly the way it should have been.  You felt like you were watching something seedy and disturbing, which is exactly what her life was all about.  Trying to justify that many murders based on a single sexual violation was insane.  I am glad the film told the tale as close to what it probably truly was.",5,Distrubing but it hits home,1101600000,"11 28, 2004",2004,505,"['Having', 'watched', 'trial', 'Eileen', 'Court', 'TV', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'believe', 'Theron', 'did', 'more', 'acting', 'film', 'brought', 'Eileen', 'back', 'life', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'magnificent', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'exactly', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'something', 'seedy', 'disturbing', 'exactly', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'Trying', 'justify', 'many', 'murders', 'based', 'single', 'sexual', 'violation', 'was', 'insane', 'am', 'glad', 'film', 'told', 'tale', 'close', 'what', 'probably', 'truly', 'was']",Monster

Roger Ebert even went on record saying this was one of the best performances he had ever seen in film history. (Considering how many thousands of films critics see, that's saying ALOT).  I still can't believe it's her when I see the movie.  What an amazing transformation, up there with Nicole Kidman's in ""The Hours"".  Charlize's performance is so gut wrenching and sad it almost makes you  feel sorry for this woman you almost forget is a serial killer. You end up feeling so bad for her when she's out trying to turn her life around and go on job interviews, only to be scoffed at and denied,  (i'm sure we've all felt that rejection at some time in our lives).  I only wonder if Ailleen Wournos actually did try to find a way out. Rather than view this movie as a play by play real life crime drama, I was more impressed with the brilliant acting.  Christina Ricci also did a great acting job, she's always a trip.  I have no idea how Charlize channeled the aura and energy of her character but it is almost unreal to watch. A sad and ironic twist of fate that Miss Wuornos didn't get to see the movie about her crime spree life and an academy award won in her essence.",5,Scary Movie,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,1259,"['one', 'could', 'predict', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'playing', 'role', 'winning', 'oscar', 'less', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'even', 'went', 'record', 'saying', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'history', 'Considering', 'how', 'many', 'thousands', 'films', 'critics', 'see', 'saying', 'ALOT', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'What', 'amazing', 'transformation', 'up', 'there', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Hours', 'Charlize', 'performance', 'so', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'sad', 'almost', 'feel', 'sorry', 'woman', 'almost', 'forget', 'serial', 'killer', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'so', 'bad', 'when', 'out', 'trying', 'turn', 'life', 'go', 'job', 'interviews', 'only', 'be', 'scoffed', 'denied', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'rejection', 'time', 'lives', 'only', 'wonder', 'Ailleen', 'Wournos', 'actually', 'did', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'out', 'Rather', 'view', 'movie', 'play', 'play', 'real', 'life', 'crime', 'drama', 'was', 'more', 'impressed', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'acting', 'job', 'always', 'trip', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'Charlize', 'channeled', 'aura', 'energy', 'character', 'almost', 'unreal', 'watch', 'sad', 'ironic', 'twist', 'fate', 'Miss', 'Wuornos', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'movie', 'crime', 'spree', 'life', 'academy', 'award', 'won', 'essence']",Monster
