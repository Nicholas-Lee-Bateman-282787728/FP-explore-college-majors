191912,A3D728MIQI56LK,1574926403,"DreamWeaverIV ""Sim2000""","[1, 1]",I was very pleased with the tape. My only wish is that it could have been a DVD.The movie itself is a classic.  I am a fan of Lauren Hewett(Ocean Girl) and was pleasantly surprised to see a very young Emily Browning (about 8 or 9 years old).  The story is set in scenic settings in Australia. It is a story about a teenage girl's (Hewett) adaption to a new family in a rustic setting following her mother's death. Her mother had been well to do and a stage star.  Her new family lives a simple life with not much in the way of money. I enjoyed this movie which was originally a made for a TV Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation.,4,Echo of Thunder: A Review,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,627,"['was', 'very', 'pleased', 'tape', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'DVD.The', 'movie', 'classic', 'am', 'fan', 'Lauren', 'Hewett', 'Ocean', 'Girl', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'very', 'young', 'Emily', 'Browning', '8', '9', 'years', 'old', 'story', 'set', 'scenic', 'settings', 'Australia', 'story', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Hewett', 'adaption', 'new', 'family', 'rustic', 'setting', 'following', 'mother', 'death', 'mother', 'had', 'been', 'well', 'do', 'stage', 'star', 'new', 'family', 'simple', 'life', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'money', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'TV', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'presentation']",N/A
