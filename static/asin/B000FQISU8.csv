I saw some of the DVD with my son.  It was good.  I was impressed with the way the character was trying to make things right with others.  This movie had some moral values and showed how to get along with others in a small way.  This was not too violate for kids.  I would recommend this to others that have children that like dogs.  It is for the whole family to enjoy.,5,DVD Karate Dog,1260835200,"12 15, 2009",2009,478,"['would', 'have', 'wanted', 'know', 'little', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'son', 'watched', 'saw', 'DVD', 'son', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'impressed', 'way', 'character', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'others', 'movie', 'had', 'moral', 'values', 'showed', 'how', 'get', 'others', 'small', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'violate', 'kids', 'would', 'recommend', 'others', 'have', 'children', 'dogs', 'whole', 'family', 'enjoy']",N/A

SHAME ON YOU! And before I get a lot of hating I'd like to say, yes I'm aware that he died and that is a tragedy and it's not to be taken lightly. BUT SWEET FANCY MOSES! This is the man who directed A Christmas Story, one of the greatest Christmas films of all time. This is the man who directed Porky's, one of the quintessential teen comedies of the 1980's. Black Christmas, considered the first slasher film. He's done movies that have gotten actors Oscar nominations. How could you go so low!? And John Voight! FOR SHAAAAAME! You're a good actor, and Oscar winning acotr. You're a better actor than you're freakin daughter (Angelina Jolie for those that don't know. And that's right I think she's overrated as an actress, she's done some good things but they are few and far between). As for Chevy Chase...well, given how his career was bad at this point I'm not really that surprised. Jamie Pressly you did My Name Is Earl, you're so much funnier than this. PAT MORITA! MR. MIYAGI! OH LORD! I just can't believe that this movie got made, that anyone would think this was a good idea. Oh it's good clean family fun. Oh sure, if you consider the strange romantic undertones between the cop and the dog, the killing of an old man, and so many other wrong things.",1,OH BOB! BOOOOOOOB! WHY BOB!?

Simon Rex (the last two SCARY MOVIES) stars as a computer savvy policeman who finds himself in possession of a talking karate dog (voiced by Chevy Chase).  Together they plan to solve the murder of the dog's beloved owner (the late Pat Morita) at the hands of corporate mogul Jon Voight (deliciously hammy).

I found Karate Dog to be just adorable. When the movie first starts Cho Cho's (Karate dog) master is murdered, and we learn that Cho Cho can talk.  Yes, it is a tad sad when the master dies, but it gets better fast.  When the police arrive, in comes LAPD computer expert Peter, who is not respected by his peers.  Cho Cho was told to talk to only the one who seeks the truth, and Peter did. He follows him home, reveals himself to him and after Peter gets over the shock they become partners in solving his masters murder.  This is where all the action begins.This really is a very cute story that you would be happy to sit and share with your children.  It has adventure, humor and a good storyline and believe me the ending is priceless. We giggled through this one, and I believe you will too. Well worth a night or a saturday afternoon.
