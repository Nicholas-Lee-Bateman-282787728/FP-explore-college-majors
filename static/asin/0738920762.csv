The setup is that Ernie stops by the Furry Arms Hotel to return a lost room key, where he shows bumbling hotel owners Humphrey and Ingrid that things (like room keys) can be organized with numbers.  I also like that this video isn't scrubbed clean of any conflict - the much-maligned bellhop, Benny the Bunny, is one of Kevin Clash's best characters, and he's terrific in this video; he and Ernie show how to return a sour face with a smile (and some innocent teasing!)Although there is one good clip - ""Martian Beauty #9,"" unfortunately, this doesn't include some of the ingenious and artistic number clips from Sesame Street past:  no bakers falling down stairs, no pinball machine, no counting marble machines.

(Ernie, in particular, is without his characteristic mischief.) But, it's not new enough to be instantly recognizable to the kids of today.

1907,A26WVK274IA7DN,0738920762,Sarah Bellum,"[0, 0]","This one has some decent material, but it takes too long to get to it. It begins with Ernie finding a room key from the Furry Arms Hotel and he proceeds there to return it. Once there, he engages in some banter with Benny the Bunny, the hotel owner and some hotel staff. This goes on for several minutes and becomes tedious before some short Sesame Street segments are able to offer a brief respite. Some of these are good, though the song with three blackbirds is not very good and lasts too long. Also, the MC Elmo song about the Number Five is also on The Best of Elmo DVD; so, if you are looking for exclusive Elmo material for your child, this is not your best bet. Now, I like Ernie as much as the next person, but I'm not certain what they were thinking when they decided to feature so much interaction with other, practically unknown characters. He ends up dinging the bellhop bell fifteen times, which is way too repetitious for even the youngest viewer.
