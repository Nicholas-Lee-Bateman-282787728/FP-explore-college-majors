860916,A1A4NH8B337AQG,B000654YRY,Albert G. Smith Jr.,"[125, 127]","I really liked this DVD.  It took a long time to get it upon its release (almost two months), but it is more than worth the wait.The production value is very high.  There is a nice opening sequence where the band and roadies arrive at the venue, and get ready to put on the show.  The DVD uses this sequence to introduce the players, showing them getting off of busses, walking down corridors, and other mundane predatory actions.  Knopfler walks out to a very enthusiastic crowd and after a few seconds of thunderous applause launches into the first song.  I was very happy (as a guitar player myself) that many of his solos were shown in close-up detail.  I like little things like that, seeing how he works to get that sound.  I will not go over every song, but just be sure, there is not a single piece of filler here, although there would be a couple of songs that might be considered MIA.  I could not imagine seeing B.B. King in concert without his performing ""The Thrill is Gone"", so seeing Dire Straits and not having them perform the break through ""Sultans of Swing"", the song that introduced them to the world is a bit strange.  Oh well, you can't have everything.  There is a good mix of rockers, softer more mellow songs and plenty of opportunity for Knopfler to let the other members of the band show off a bit.  Overall, a great performance.The one weakness that requires me to go with 4 stars rather than 5 is the fact that this is a medium that can offer so much more in terms of sound.  That this is not offered in some form of 5.1 is a crime.  I love concerts on DVD when you hear the crowds behind you and the music hits from many angles.  If I gave this basic two-channel stereo rendering a 5 star rating, it would not be fair to the other DVDs out there that earned their 5s with terrific audio engineering.  If this was a 1980s VHS tape, it would be a 5, but for a DVD introduced in the year 2005, two-channel stereo can't be given a perfect score for a concert performance.",4,"I really enjoyed this DVD, but...",1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,1997,"['really', 'liked', 'DVD', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'release', 'almost', 'two', 'months', 'more', 'wait.The', 'production', 'value', 'very', 'high', 'nice', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'band', 'roadies', 'arrive', 'venue', 'get', 'ready', 'put', 'show', 'DVD', 'sequence', 'introduce', 'players', 'showing', 'getting', 'busses', 'walking', 'down', 'corridors', 'other', 'mundane', 'predatory', 'actions', 'Knopfler', 'out', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'crowd', 'few', 'seconds', 'thunderous', 'applause', 'first', 'song', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'guitar', 'player', 'many', 'solos', 'were', 'shown', 'close-up', 'detail', 'like', 'little', 'things', 'seeing', 'how', 'get', 'sound', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'song', 'just', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'single', 'piece', 'filler', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'couple', 'songs', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'MIA', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'seeing', 'B.B', 'King', 'concert', 'performing', 'Thrill', 'Gone', 'seeing', 'Dire', 'Straits', 'not', 'having', 'perform', 'break', 'Sultans', 'Swing', 'song', 'introduced', 'world', 'bit', 'strange', 'Oh', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything', 'good', 'mix', 'rockers', 'softer', 'more', 'mellow', 'songs', 'plenty', 'opportunity', 'Knopfler', 'let', 'other', 'members', 'band', 'show', 'off', 'bit', 'Overall', 'great', 'performance.The', 'one', 'weakness', 'go', '4', 'stars', 'rather', '5', 'fact', 'medium', 'can', 'offer', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'terms', 'sound', 'not', 'offered', 'form', '5.1', 'crime', 'love', 'concerts', 'DVD', 'when', 'hear', 'crowds', 'music', 'many', 'angles', 'gave', 'basic', 'two-channel', 'stereo', 'rendering', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'fair', 'other', 'DVDs', 'there', 'earned', '5s', 'terrific', 'audio', 'engineering', 'was', '1980s', 'VHS', 'tape', 'would', 'be', '5', 'DVD', 'introduced', 'year', '2005', 'two-channel', 'stereo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'given', 'perfect', 'score', 'concert', 'performance']",N/A

""On the Night"" is a sorry 15-years-later fake reunion (with only the original bassist returning to join Knopfler)along with a dozen mediocre session players cashing in on a giant stadium tour.

I saw this tour when it came to the U.S. and was somewhat disappointed, but to see it in close-up now confirms my ""they're only in it for the money"" suspicions.

I agree with another reviewer; as a guitar player, the closeups of Mark's fingers on the frets are invaluable (I even put it on slo-mo; there's no way you're gonna get it all watching at regular speed) and his grimaces of concentration show how much he puts into his work. (Good news; he hasn't changed.) Most of this material was from later Dire Straits efforts (the exceptions; Solid Rock, Romeo and Juliet, Private Investigations) but all was done cleanly and well, and it's patently obvious that the whole group is having a good time. It's always nice to see Mark smile. He smiles a lot on this tour.I never got the opportunity to see the Straits in concert - a sin I've remedied since Mark has been out on his own - but I can tell that everyone in the stadium where this concert was filmed was totally involved, as it's clearly raining hard near the stage but nobody seems to care in the least.

My other reason is a bit more related to this particular tour: the band got away from their roots and became a mammoth production with up to nine people onstage in some of the numbers which, for me, tended to obscure the music in some places (I got particularly tired of the excessive pedal steel guitar work on many of the songs.) That's personal preference, of course, and others love the larger orchestrations.Overall I think this is a good DVD, although it really doesn't capture the energy of Dire Straits in concert as well as some other productions, including the much earlier, and generally superior, ""Alchemy,"" which will hopefully be released on DVD soon.",4,Good Performance From Knopfler And Company,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,1286,"['had', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'Dire', 'Straits', 'three', 'times', 'Street', 'tour', 'DVD', 'was', 'taken', 'have', 'previously', 'seen', 'VHS', 'cable', 'broadcast', 'versions', 'concert', 'more', 'material', 'found', 'elsewhere', 'quality', 'DVD', 'production', 'substantially', 'better', 'bit', 'travesty', 'see', 'Dire', 'Straits', 'show', 'Sultans', 'Swing', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out.It', 'pains', 'give', 'Dire', 'Straits', 'production', 'less', 'five', 'stars', 'gave', 'DVD', 'four', 'couple', 'reasons', 'most', 'obvious', 'being', 'obviously', 'questionable', 'editing', 'set', 'list', 'other', 'reason', 'bit', 'more', 'related', 'particular', 'tour', 'band', 'got', 'away', 'roots', 'became', 'mammoth', 'production', 'nine', 'people', 'onstage', 'numbers', 'tended', 'obscure', 'music', 'places', 'got', 'particularly', 'tired', 'excessive', 'pedal', 'steel', 'guitar', 'work', 'many', 'songs', 'personal', 'preference', 'course', 'others', 'love', 'larger', 'orchestrations.Overall', 'think', 'good', 'DVD', 'really', ""n't"", 'capture', 'energy', 'Dire', 'Straits', 'concert', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'productions', 'including', 'much', 'earlier', 'generally', 'superior', 'Alchemy', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'soon']",N/A

It was not, I read, as wildly successful as their tour of the mid 1980s and after the tour the Straits faded into history.About one-half of the songs on the DVD are from the Straits last CD, ""On Every Street.""  There is a country sound on many tracks, emphasized by Paul Franklin's steel guitar.  I quickly tired of the opening rock numbers, ""Calling Elvis,"" ""Walk of Life,"" and ""Heavy Fuel,"" but the mellow songs that followed made up for it.  Mark Knopfler's moody and exquisite songs ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Brothers in Arms"" are here, as are superb versions of little known tunes such as ""Your Latest Trick"" ""On Every Street"" and ""You and Your Friend.""  The bluesy, country solo of Knopfler in ""You and Your Friend"" is one of his best ever-- and that is saying something.

From the concert opener `Calling Elvis' with that constant underlying pedal steel riff and tongue in cheek quacking percussion (you'll know what I mean when you hear it) to the awesome `Heavy Fuel' and `On Every Street' with more amazing pedal steel from Paul Franklin, this concert has a great selection of tracks from the `On Every Street' album. It also has some firm favourites like `Walk of Life', `Romeo and Juliet', `Private Investigation', `Money for Nothing' and `Brothers in Arms' to round of the track selection in style. Knopflers guitar playing is as tight and inspiring as ever and the tone he manages to wring out of his Pensa Suhr guitars is nothing but breath taking. The audience are obviously enjoying themselves, as are all the musicians and this makes for great viewing experience, really putting you in the moment with the crowd. For a slice of live Dire Straits this really can't be beaten and it is still a favourite live dvd of mine all these years later.
