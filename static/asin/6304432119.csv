While it has it's moments and is harmless besides some language in it. I found it to be quite bland most of the time. They were trying too hard I think to make chemistry with one another the actors I mean. The reason why watched this is Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney, while I like George's Character as the dad. Michelle's character as the single mom was one dimensional and unconvincing, only few spots does her character shine at all. It seemed like the screenwriter must've been going through something themselves. Because he or she forgot to make characters in this film that people actually care about, frankly this movie was a bore about the only interesting people in this picture was the single mom's mother,the editor. Too bad I want to like this picture it had the makings of a great one it just didn't cut it. I mean make the cut as a film I would recommend to people, I won't be recommending this one.

421401,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6304432119,Byron Kolln,"[2, 4]","Wonderfully charming romantic comedy with the brilliant teaming of Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney, playing two divorced parents trying to muddle through a hectic, rainy New York day whilst babysitting their small children (Mae Whitman and Alex D. Linz), after they missed out on a school excursion.Parents will readily identify with the characters that Pfeiffer and Clooney play, as they attempt to hold their sanity whilst everything around them crumbles into comedic chaos. Pfeiffer is a strong single mother who has completely given up on finding another 'Prince Charming'; Clooney is a cocky journalist whose own lovelife is anything but dull, yet wanting to provide a more stable home for his little daughter. Opposites do tend to attract, but Cupid will definitely have his hands full with this pair!This is a refreshing romantic comedy, completely charming and without the usual sweet sentiment that most of these genre films seem to get saddled with. The support cast includes solid work from Ellen Greene, Holland Taylor, Rachel York, Charles Durning and Gregory Jbara. Little Mae Whitman and Alex D. Linz are engaging as well.

When you're stuck in a bus for 11 hours, anything to pass the time is great. Being a guy that has a soft spot for chick flicks, this movie really surprised me. It's not really all sappy or anything, it's just more taken from real life. There's no unrealistic dialogue. If you are the kind of person that enjoys realism in movies, then this is the movie for you. It has it all.It has comedy, romance, adventure (kind of). This movie really kind of takes you on a roller coaster ride. The acting in it is brilliant. I give Michelle and George 5 stars for their acting. It helps that it's a great script too, though. The music is fitting to the story. I really like the point in the movie where they put in Van Morrison's Have I Told You Lately, it's so fitting.To sum up the movie in as least amount of words as possible, I would say the movie is about how a day can seem hectic, full of problems, and just downright stressful. But at the end of the day, it can be looked upon as a great day. You can hate someone at the start of a day, and at the end, fall in love with them.This movie will have a special meaning to me for a long time, because the day I saw it to me, was exactly like the movie.

421407,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,6304432119,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[1, 2]","This review is for ""One Fine Day"" DVD Release Date: January 14, 2003PLEASE NOTE THAT ONCE AGAIN AMAZON HAS LUMPED REVIEWS FOR ALL VERSIONS (along with CDs) OF ""One Fine Day,"" THUS DENIGRATING THIS DVD VERSION!!!I never saw ""One Fine Day"" in the theater, and purchased it based upon other reviews.  Moreover, given the basic plot and the cast, I figured that I would really enjoy the film.  While I can see why many people might enjoy the film because of ""the underlying story of the career chase at the expense of family,"" I found myself questioning the ""believability"" of the events as they unfolded in the film.  Conversely, while I suppose that others may find ""One Fine Day"" to be a ""romantic comedy,"" I do not really see the film as such; it is just too hard for me to conceive that the events portrayed are all that romantic.  And my personal experiences make it too difficult to accept that Melanie and Jack ""find"" a romantic connection given the events they go through.  Attraction, yes; ""love,"" NO.  I personally felt dismayed that the film was suggesting that such things happen in real life.  Yet the performances and presentation of ""One Fine Day"" are: richly inviting; a nice fantasy; a chance to feel connected to others through empathy with the characters; and, a chance to ""escape reality"" for 109 minutes.  Hence, I have a lot of ambivalent feelings about ""One Fine Day.""Like many others, I have lived through some (if not most) of the events depicted--and I whole-heartedly support the theme of  ""One Fine Day"" that family comes first--I truly doubt I could begin to accomplish all the things that Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer's character) and Jack Taylor (played by George Clooney) manage to do in one day.  Even living in a relatively traffic free location it would be difficult, let alone in a major city and using taxi-cabs.  I have spent time in major cities--including  San Francisco, Vancouver (B.C.), Canada, and Frankfurt, Germany--and I have never encountered someone that I would ""trust"" my child with after just a brief introduction--even where we both knew a third person (Jack's former wife in ""One Fine Day"").  Call me overly cautious if you want; call me overly skeptical if you like; but I have to know I can trust and feel comfortable with the person I am leaving my children with to watch over--even if it is ""convenient.""  Indeed, I would have to say that the actions of both Melanie and Jack boarder on child endangerment; all be it, everything ""works out"" favorably, and both Jack and Malenie are portrayed as ""decent"" individuals.Perhaps most disturbing for me, then, is the subtle messages that viewers most likely take away from ""One Fine Day.""  In particular, is the notion that ""everything"" works out for the best--especially if you try hard enough.  Family and work, in modern life are truly at odds, and, unlike the film, people are not finding such ""happiness"" and balance in their lives; (at least from what I have seen and read about).  But ""One Fine Day"" perpetrates the myth that society is ""making it work""--something that I have not personally seen or experienced in my life and the lives of most people around me.  Therefore, I cannot fully recommend ""One Fine Day"" as a film for everyone.  It is a pleasant divergence; it is a cute movie; it is a ""feel good"" film; and it has Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney (although I did not ""feel"" any chemistry between Pfeiffer and Clooney).  On the other hand, as I stated above, the film's conclusion that family ""should"" come first is a very important message that is a huge plus for watching ""One Fine Day.""Please Note: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.

They are actually in a post-traumatic stress situation, where they don't know what the heck is wrong themselves.  I would advise both the Clooney character and the Pfeiffer character to remain single until their children grow up and leave home, so the kids will not be damaged by divorce twice in their young lives.  This couple is going to have a nasty break-up, it's inevitable.The people in this film really are awful people that I have no interest in getting to know any better.

Linz, cute as a button but obnoxious and dramatically insecure), holds her head to the ceiling and all at once it looks like she's all chin, a chin so sharp it could wound a man.  Luckily the boy actor was spared, although he certainly hasn't been seen much lately.  I guess he had a vogue six or seven years ago but, his astonishing self-absorption on screen foretold a history of audiences growing tired of him.  Watching little Alex is like watching a glob of mercury harden into a mirror, while Michelle Pfeiffer who, for all I know may be equally narcissistic in real life, seems always to be sentient of every living thing--even the props--with which she interacts; I think people in the movie theater view this ""noticing"" quality as respect, and in turn we like her because of that.  Her beauty is sort of freakish, and Hollywood plays with that freakishness as they did with Garbo, and thus Pfeiffer plays Catwoman on the one hand, and on the other, the driven career woman who doesn't care about love or men--the Faye Dunaway part--as she does here in ONE FINE DAY, where all she cares about is her job in the architectural firm, and carrying that balsawood maquette up from the shop into her boss's office.  Meanwhile little Alex (Sammy) is radio-controlling little cars across the carpet of the office suite.  You see the model car speeding towards Melanie's high heels--then you see her face, radiant and obsessed, in the soft glow of the balsa office park.  A catastrophe is going to happen, and then it does.  Our beautiful untouchable goddess is laid low, pretty much what the audience has been yearning to happen since the opening credits.

Painstakingly slow and &quot;sweet&quot;, it almost puts you to sleep while taking a long and pristinely pure route to the budding romance between Pfeiffer and Clooney. This is the type of movie best suited to actresses like Meg Ryan, not to serious and generally talented people such as Pfeiffer.All that said, why then did I give it 3 stars, let alone 1? Well, I'd give it 2 1/2 actually...but Amazon does not have that option. So I gave it the benefit of the doubt - it was, after all, two bucks.The reasons behind the stars: The occasional humor was, if stupid in places, hilarious. I am a melter for any cats in a movie, and there were some very sweet ones here. Lest you think me strange - if I love cats why not the movie? - the other reason to give this anything was - of course, the same reason I rented it in the first place - George Clooney. Reprising his role in ER, he shows us  the picture of a bohemian writer who is not exactly businesslike in either work or child care. Why this is supposed to be negative, I don't know - many of us children of the flower children grew up similarily and I don't see the problem. Hey, we'll put the guns down. :&gt;Yeah, Clooney has bedroom eyes and a good voice, the cats are darling, the humor is pretty good, but unless those reasons appeal to you, don't bother. There are many better movies out there - if you're looking for a sweet screwball romance, try Benny &amp; Joon.
