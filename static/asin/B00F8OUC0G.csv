1670727,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B00F8OUC0G,J. Martin,"[2, 4]","Green Briefs is a collection of five gay-centered short movies, all related in some way to family. All five are closely focused on very specific circumstances, and each one may be meaningful to people who are in or have been in exactly the same very specific circumstances. They could be called ""issue"" movies, each meaningful only to viewers who are concerned about its specific issue. Only one of the five manages to transcend its narrow issue to touch people in ANY kind of situation ANYWHERE. That exception is Shabbat Dinner.Only one of the other titles (Kimchi Fried Dumplings) gives any clue as to the movie's subject (a mixed-race Asian-American family); the other three have generic titles (Pride, The Commitment, The Symphony of Silence) that give no hint what their subjects might be. The fact that Shabbat Dinner most boldly announces its narrow, Jewish focus and then explodes that narrowness is tribute to its courage and the skill with which it was made.Even more remarkable is that Shabbat Dinner's ""skill"" is not at all apparent in the beginning. It is by far the worst looking and sounding, the least professional movie of the five. The photography and the sound are some of the worst I've ever encountered. It looks like it was recorded on a huge, 10-pound 1980s VHS camcorder - on 30-year-old tape - by a restless ten-year-old. The camera is only occasionally in focus and jerks randomly from one extreme close-up to another. The dialogue - while always understandable - sounds like some parts were recorded on the camcorder and other parts were dubbed in later. Viewers who like to criticize ""production values"" will have a field day with it.What it does, though, and does with astonishing power, is capture the thrilling awkwardness of adolescent sexuality like no other movie I have ever seen. The two boys could not be clumsier, less cool, less attractive to an outsider. They are not at all beautiful physically, but they discover something in each other of such raw, irresistible power that they crash into each other like stars colliding in the center of a galaxy. It is joyful and breathtaking, and it transforms those two graceless, pimply adolescents boys into something far more beautiful than the most idolized star in Hollywood.Two of the other short movies - Pride and Kimchi Fried Dumplings - are about caring for aged parents and reconciling either with them or with siblings who are caring for them. As far as I'm concerned, helpless old people belong in nursing homes, not tied like millstones around their children's necks, so I have no sympathy with young people who get themselves into such situations. If you do, then you may like those two movies. (I'm old myself, by the way, not a self-centered thirtysomething with better things to do.)The Commitment is about a gay couple trying to adopt a baby, and The Symphony of Silence is about teenage bullying - both currently popular issues that happen to be meaningless to me. The movies, while earnest and probably effective for their target audiences, don't manage to transcend their narrow issues.I generously gave this DVD two stars at first, but I'm going to raise it to five ONLY because of Shabbat Dinner. Those 14 minutes are well worth the cost of the DVD. The other 97 minutes are worth watching only if their issues are meaningful to you personally. They were not to me.",5,"Only one of the five short movies transcends its ""issue""",1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,3370,"['Green', 'Briefs', 'collection', 'five', 'gay-centered', 'short', 'movies', 'related', 'way', 'family', 'five', 'are', 'closely', 'focused', 'very', 'specific', 'circumstances', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'meaningful', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'have', 'been', 'exactly', 'same', 'very', 'specific', 'circumstances', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'issue', 'movies', 'meaningful', 'only', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'concerned', 'specific', 'issue', 'Only', 'one', 'five', 'manages', 'transcend', 'narrow', 'issue', 'touch', 'people', 'ANY', 'kind', 'situation', 'ANYWHERE', 'exception', 'Shabbat', 'Dinner.Only', 'one', 'other', 'titles', 'Kimchi', 'Fried', 'Dumplings', 'clue', 'movie', 'subject', 'mixed-race', 'Asian-American', 'family', 'other', 'three', 'have', 'generic', 'titles', 'Pride', 'Commitment', 'Symphony', 'Silence', 'give', 'hint', 'what', 'subjects', 'might', 'be', 'fact', 'Shabbat', 'Dinner', 'most', 'boldly', 'narrow', 'Jewish', 'focus', 'then', 'narrowness', 'tribute', 'courage', 'skill', 'was', 'made.Even', 'more', 'remarkable', 'Shabbat', 'Dinner', 'skill', 'not', 'apparent', 'beginning', 'far', 'worst', 'looking', 'sounding', 'least', 'professional', 'movie', 'five', 'photography', 'sound', 'are', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'was', 'recorded', 'huge', '10-pound', '1980s', 'VHS', 'camcorder', '30-year-old', 'tape', 'restless', 'ten-year-old', 'camera', 'only', 'occasionally', 'focus', 'jerks', 'randomly', 'one', 'extreme', 'close-up', 'dialogue', 'while', 'always', 'understandable', 'sounds', 'parts', 'were', 'recorded', 'camcorder', 'other', 'parts', 'were', 'dubbed', 'later', 'Viewers', 'who', 'like', 'criticize', 'production', 'values', 'will', 'have', 'field', 'day', 'it.What', 'though', 'astonishing', 'power', 'capture', 'thrilling', 'awkwardness', 'adolescent', 'sexuality', 'other', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'two', 'boys', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'clumsier', 'less', 'cool', 'less', 'attractive', 'outsider', 'are', 'not', 'beautiful', 'physically', 'discover', 'something', 'other', 'such', 'raw', 'irresistible', 'power', 'crash', 'other', 'stars', 'colliding', 'center', 'galaxy', 'joyful', 'breathtaking', 'two', 'graceless', 'pimply', 'adolescents', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'beautiful', 'most', 'idolized', 'star', 'Hollywood.Two', 'other', 'short', 'movies', 'Pride', 'Kimchi', 'Fried', 'Dumplings', 'are', 'caring', 'aged', 'parents', 'reconciling', 'siblings', 'who', 'are', 'caring', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'helpless', 'old', 'people', 'belong', 'nursing', 'homes', 'not', 'tied', 'millstones', 'children', 'necks', 'have', 'sympathy', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'such', 'situations', 'do', 'then', 'may', 'like', 'two', 'movies', ""'m"", 'old', 'myself', 'way', 'not', 'self-centered', 'thirtysomething', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'Commitment', 'gay', 'couple', 'trying', 'adopt', 'baby', 'Symphony', 'Silence', 'teenage', 'bullying', 'currently', 'popular', 'issues', 'happen', 'be', 'meaningless', 'movies', 'earnest', 'probably', 'effective', 'target', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'manage', 'transcend', 'narrow', 'issues.I', 'generously', 'gave', 'DVD', 'two', 'stars', 'first', ""'m"", 'going', 'raise', 'five', 'ONLY', 'Shabbat', 'Dinner', '14', 'minutes', 'are', 'well', 'cost', 'DVD', 'other', '97', 'minutes', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'only', 'issues', 'are', 'meaningful', 'personally', 'were', 'not']",Green Briefs
