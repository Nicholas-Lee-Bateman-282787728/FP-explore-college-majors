758835,A2TT4AA3QO0DPY,B00009WHRM,Jay Young,"[1, 1]","I have fond memories of watching Will Vinton's ""Claymation Christmas"" about 20 years ago. Made at a time when claymation was still considered cutting-edge, ""A Claymation Christmas"" is in the format of a variety show, with dialogue between the hosts interspersed with musical numbers. The hosts are the loveable dinosaurs Rex and Herb, and make the perfect odd couple. Rex is serious, mature, and dignified, whereas Herb is playful, childlike, and constantly makes a fool of himself. As such, the banter between the 2 is  quite amusing. Another humorous aspect to Rex and Herb's interactions is their interruptions by groups singing a distorted version of the Wassail song. First, a group of dogs with a portable Waffle stand come, singing ""Here we come a-waffling""; then a group of geese come singing ""Here we come a-waddling""; then a group of pigs come singing ""Here we come a-wallowing"". In each instance, Herb goes over to the group and gorges himself with whatever treats they're offering.The musical numbers include:""We Three Kings""- The Wise Men sing the verses, and their camels sing the  chorus, bebop style.""Carol of the Bells""- Performed by anthropomorphic church bells that hit themselves with hammers to sound their own particular notes. Maestro Quasimodo conducts. All goes well, except for one inept bell who never seems to hit his note correctly or at the right time, until the final note. This one's hilarious!""O Christmas Tree""- Takes place at a Christmas tree, with various scenes inside the ornaments.""Angels We Have Heard on High""- Takes place on a frozen lake, with hilarious antics involving penguins and two ice-skating walruses!""Joy to the World""- A soul/jazz version of the popular Christmas song, with kaleidoscopic images in stain-glassed windows. This one was actually my least favorite.""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer""- Performed by the California Raisins. You know you're an 80s child if you remember them.""Here We Come A-Wassailing""- Ensemble Finale, sung when a group of elves arrive finally singing the correct version of the song.""Claymation Christmas"" will delight people of all ages, at Christmas or any other time of the year.

Its send-up of pedantic folks like ourselves (who love to lecture on the meaning of Christmas words) is humbling, in a good way. The hilarity as Rex the dinosaur tries his best to get everyone to sing ""The Wassailing Song"" properly becomes the recurring theme in the piece. His co-host, treat-loving dino Herb -- tries his best to keep the mood light and his stomach full. Meanwhile, the mangling of Rex's project continues: geese singing about ""Here we come a-waddlng""; pigs singing of ""wallowing""; batter-baking dogs of ""waffling,"" sending Rex's BP spiking through the ceiling.The animated skits are perfect. The Motown sounds of ""We Three Kings"" and ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer"" (playfully set in a seedy urban neighborhood and played by the Califormia Raisins) bring the tunes up to date. The most incredible piece artistically is ""Joy to the World"" -- with its gospel-inspired sound and kaleidiscopic renderings of angels, mothers, father and children. There are ice-skating walruses, adorable penguins, do-wopping camels and more.Aside from being a hoot, ""Claymation Christmas"" is an artistic tour-de-force in a medium that normally doesn't get that kind of respect.
