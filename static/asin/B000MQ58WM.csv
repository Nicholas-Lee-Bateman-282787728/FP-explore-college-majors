Stand out episodes include:The Vigil - Mary Ellen makes a wrong diagnosis that puts Grandma near death.The Baptism - Olivia struggles to get John and her kids baptized during a revival.The Firestorm - John-Boy causes panic when he publishes parts of Hitler's Mein Kampf in his newspaper.The Wedding - Mary Ellen goes through personal changes leading up to her wedding.The Cloudburst - John-Boy crosses a line with Grandpa when he sells his meadow to a developer.The Pony Cart - the best episode of the season IMO. Aunt Martha Corrine comes to visit the family and upsets everyone. But she's hiding a secret.The Best Christmas - Olivia desperately wants the family to be together because she feels that this will be the last Christmas that the whole family will be together.The Inferno - John-Boy travels to NJ and witnesses the Hindenburg disaster.The Long Night - While visiting Esther in the hospital, Grandpa causes a disturbance and is banned from the hospital.

While the Blue Ridge Chronicle is a lifelong dream, John-Boy learns that he may be in over his head, in episodes such as ""The Firestorm,"" when the locals are angered over his decision to publish excerpts of Hitler's book, and ""The Cloudburst,"" when the threat of having the bank take his printing press causes John-Boy to sell the meadow Grandpa left him.In a desperate attempt to raise money for school, second-eldest son Jason takes a job as pianist at the Dew Drop Inn -- a huge source of contention for Olivia and Grandma, who view the place as a den of sin.Also, Erin begins a more adult life, working as a telephone operator; while Ben helps his brother with newspaper advertising, Jim Bob insists on being called James Robert as he tinkers with the old car parts he dreams of turning into a whole vehicle; and Elizabeth continues to enjoy her position as family baby.Grandma faces serious illness, causing Grandpa much emotional trauma; and Richard Thomas departs at the end of the season, resulting in a different John-Boy until series end. In my opinion, it's always strange when they do that, even when I know they really had no choice, as Richard Thomas wanted to leave the show.

1048966,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B000MQ58WM,Simon Davis,"[46, 48]","I believe you would be hard pressed to find a more genuinely loved television family than ""The Waltons"". The classic series which ran an amazing nine seasons and returned in a number of later television movies  seems as fresh today as when it premiered in 1972. With simple stories based around love of family and respect for others, the value of giving without expecting something in return, and with a not always ""happily ever after"",conclusion to each episode this series has endeared itself to viewers all over the world ever since. Being in Australia to me ""The Waltons"", represents much that is fine about good old fashioned values no matter what the country you live in and there was rarely an episode that in some way did not move me to reflect on my own life and set of values. Season Five of ""The Waltons"" saw the series really at the top of its form, still fresh and beautifully written, popular in the ratings on many continents, and still winning Emmy Awards. Despite this continued success however season five also unfortunately saw the first of the cast changes that ultimately led to the series' decline. Just half way through the season Ellen Corby who brilliantly played sharp tongued, salt of the earth Grandma, suffered a stroke in real life which forced the producers to write her character out of the story for a season and a half. To add to the producers worries the final episode of the season also saw pivotal character John -Boy played superbly by a much underrated Richard Thomas leaving Waltons Mountain to pursue his dream of writing in New York. Loosing two major cast members in the one season was certainly a blow but these departures where handled in an expert way to keep the storyline moving along.Every ""The Waltons"" fan will undoubtedly have their own favourite episodes from this last ""complete cast"", season of the series and with such a large number of really excellent stories present here it's difficult to single individual ones for special mention. A few that I believe standout are listed below.""The Fire Storm"", where John Boy flames local community tensions and fears regarding the growing menace from Nazi Germany by deciding to publish parts of Adolf Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"", in his local newspaper.""The Wedding"", which sees the first Walton Grandchild, (Mary Ellen) wed on the mountain but not to the man everyone thought was going to be the groom!""The Pony Cart"", Guest starring veteran actress Beulah Bondi in an Emmy Award winning performance as elderly aunt Martha Corinne who returns to Waltons Mountain one last time before her death.""The Best Christmas"", Amazingly the first Christmas episode in the series telling a poignant and action filled tale of Olivia's great desire to have the whole family together for one last special Christmas only to find the family scattered as the big day approaches.""The Rebellion"", (A great favourite of mine), where Olivia goes through an early mid-life crisis finding herself boring and predictable and sets out to ""update"", her image, while Grandma battles with a new rival for the right to continue as the organist at the church.""The Long Night"", a very moving story about love that knows no age when Grandpa becomes so lonely for Grandma who is still in the hospital recovering from her stroke, that he becomes a menace to the hosptial staff who then ban him from coming in to see his beloved Esther.The excellence of so many episodes in this season as well as in the following sixth season went a long way towards compensating for the absense of the characters played Ellen Corby and later Richard Thomas in the stories and in fact actually gave the series a strong sense of reality where just as in real life, nothing of course ever stays the same and where real families often experience departures and long family separations.  I highly recommend this latest box set, ""The Waltons - The Complete Fifth Season"", and despite the lack of any cast involvement in commentaries etc, the episodes alone makes this a more than worthwhile addition to your classic television DVD library.
