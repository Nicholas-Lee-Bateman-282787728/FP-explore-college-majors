It's certainly not a bad one; the dialogue just seems a bit stilted and overly dramatic at times.  In lesser hands, this would've been stuffed on a back shelf awhile ago.  Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn are extremely talented, though, both alone and as a team, so the end result is a cheerful, electric little romantic comedy.  The subject matter -wife has more prestigious job than husband- is actually rather controversial for its time (I wonder how the ending would have changed if it was remade now).

Pawl ""Dani""","[5, 5]","The title of my review is in reference to the beginning of the relationship (onscreen and off) between Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.  WOMAN OF THE YEAR was the first of nine films that the pair acted in together.  You can feel their chemistry from the opening frames of the film all the way to the end.  These actors were truly a class act together and a very hard act to follow.  Between Katherine Hepburn's purring delivery of her lines and Spencer Tracy's staunch presence, the two had a very special thing going on.  Sam Craig (Spencer Tracy) and Tess Harding (Katherine Hepburn) are a pair of rivaling journalists who end up falling for each other.  Tess is a die hard feminist and she proves to be too much for Sam to handle, at times.  So much so that her strong convictions put their relationship on the line.What works so well, here, is the combination of human drama and warm humor.  You also feel the true (and believable) love between the couple and it doesn't feel so much as a movie as a tribute to the relationship of two incomparable actors.

550629,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00004TJOE,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 5]","Katharine Hepburn already established the headstrong aspect of her screen persona in 1938's ""Holiday"" and 1940's ""The Philadelphia Story"", but she adds a worldly intellect and a beguiling sexual ardor that prove most fetching in her portrayal of multilingual political journalist Tess Harding in this 1942 film classic. In her first teaming with lifelong off-screen partner Spencer Tracy, she sets off palpable sparks with the normally taciturn actor, who plays sportswriter Sam Craig working at the same newspaper. Written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael Kanin, the plot is about the characters' whirlwind courtship from an immediate sexual attraction to an impulsive marriage, all the while struggling with each other's priorities. Needless to say, given that it's a product of its era, it becomes a matter of time before Tess bends to Sam's will but not until some intriguing observations are made about sex roles in a basically fractious relationship.However, rather than the comic fireworks generated by their later collaboration, 1949's ""Adam's Rib"", this film treads in unexpectedly sentimental melodrama, especially in the episodes where Tess has to let go of a Greek orphan she wants to adopt and in the climactic scene when she tearfully recognizes her wifely responsibilities as her aunt Ellen marries her father. Still, the pair's familiar bantering occurs when Sam explains the rules of baseball to Tess and in the final feminist reversal as she fails miserably in her attempt at domesticity. George Stevens directed the film, and he displays his sure hand with actors and an acute sense of craftsmanship throughout. Intriguingly, for a Tracy-Hepburn vehicle, it feels much more like her movie than his, and consequently their rapport is not quite up to their normal standard here. The supporting characters also feel more incidental here, even though Fay Bainter shines briefly as Ellen. It's not my favorite of their films together, but it is certainly required viewing for their fans.

550631,A3A2678OTHQYZM,B00004TJOE,"""fwooshlet""","[23, 26]","WOMAN OF THE YEAR stars Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in their first film together, his Sam Craig matched with her Tess Harding; his subtle, underplaying acting style with her stylised, personality-driven performance. It's an acting tour de force, to be sure--the two of them make the best of (and often far surpass) a somewhat limited script and interesting but stiffly played-out plot. In fact, their chemistry in this film is palpable. When someone speaks of cinematic magic, of chemistry sparking off (if not engulfing) the screen, *this*--Tracy, Hepburn, Tracy and Hepburn--is what they are talking about, even back in the days of the Hays Code. It's all mostly chaste kisses and long eye contact, often carried out in semi-darkness, and yet the two main players establish a relationship more sexual and believable than so many of the relationships portrayed in films these days. (Take the tiny moment in the cab--not the drunk scene that everyone loves, but that moment when he says, ""I've got to get something off my chest"", and she mumbles, ""I'm too heavy"", and raises her head. When he gently pulls it back to where you feel it would always belong, you know that these actors are doing something incredible.)This isn't to say that the film is without flaws. Far from it. The writing is clipped and most of the words on their own have little spark. (It takes Spencer Tracy's glowering eyes, or Katharine Hepburn's radiant smile, to add life to those words.) Even the relationship between Sam and Tess isn't set up in the most fluid of ways, leap-frogging from moment to moment, from scene to scene, without quite making the necessary connections--if you believe in Sam and Tess together (and I do), it's only because you can truly believe in Tracy and Hepburn together. The film occasionally feels like a play cobbled together from various scenes, until it hits its stride midway through the film (after Sam and Tess get married).Script aside, the plot is interesting, and certainly quite radical for its time. However, the ending (a hilarious set-piece of comedy though it might be) leaves things largely unresolved. We have a wonderful, strong female character in Tess Harding--this is clear enough in the first half of the film. But her strength, her forceful personality and go-getting attitude, become her weakness in the second half, so much so that she becomes almost a caricature of the original Tess Harding. Some of the things she does (her 'humanitarian' wholesale adoption of Chris, for example; her rudeness and blithe ignorance of Sam's worth) are truly reprehensible, and the point the writers are making is clear--a female who tries too hard to be a male loses her feminity, and cannot ever really be fulfilled. In this sense, the gender politics, as other commenters have pointed out, is 'deplorable'.And yet there is a grain of truth in it; if one *can* be brought to believe that Tess could really treat Chris and Sam in the way she does, one can't help but applaud Sam's decision to leave. The role reversal is almost complete--Sam himself comments on the fact that she 'makes love' to him to smooth over their quarrels. She charges on her own merry way without asking him about his life, his opinion, or anything that remotely matters to him. Their union was neither perfect, nor a marriage, as he justifiably charges.The uneasy tension between the admirable and the deplorable Tess Hardings comes at the end: you most certainly get the impression that the film itself didn't quite know whether or not to affirm the Tess character. In fact, by all accounts (even Hepburn's own), the film originally ended with an unqualified affirmation of Tess's character--promising to be more involved in her husband's life, Tess is depicted at a baseball game, cheering alongside Sam, getting louder and louder and rising higher in her seat above him. It was both an affirmation of Tess the character, and a lingering question mark about the Harding-Craig reunion.Test audiences didn't like it. (Apparently, it was the *women* who felt threatened by the character Hepburn portrayed on screen. She was too strong, too beautiful, too *everything* all at once.)What transpired in the end, then, was a re-shot ending that muddied the moral of the film in suggesting that women could not really be fulfilled without their men. Sam wants her to be Tess Harding Craig; she wants to be Mrs. Craig; she wants to change; he thinks (and probably knows) she can't. The logical ending would have seen Tess, cast as she had been in the traditional masculine role, wooing Sam back, only to cast doubt over whether her atypical (for the time) strength as a female would unequivocally threaten the typical male figure as embodied in Tracy's character. The original ending would have better borne out the logic of the film--a valuable DVD extra if ever there was one. You can perhaps applaud the spirit of the film, without accepting the fact that it seems to let that spirit fade away in the end.So what is there of worth in WOMAN OF THE YEAR, with its original ending gone, and its revolutionary potential muted by a slapstick scene in a kitchen with exploding waffles, too much coffee, and a woman who just can't seem to figure out how to separate eggs? Well, the answer is simple, and it's already been given. This is a movie to watch, and to watch *again*, because it is the first cinematic pairing of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. For a couple of hours, you're allowed to watch these two great, mythical actors playing two people in love... while falling in love themselves. That is most certainly a rare privilege, if ever there was one.",4,Tracy and Hepburn--perfection despite the flaws,1024012800,"06 14, 2002",2002,5655,"['WOMAN', 'THE', 'YEAR', 'Spencer', 'Tracy',

550632,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00004TJOE,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 3]","Everything you've heard about WOMAN OF THE YEAR is true.  This was the first pairing of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, and, yes, the chemistry IS evident.  Michael Kanin and Ring Lardner's script is intelligent and the dialogue is snappy for the most part.  It does touch lightly on ""issues of the day"" (the war, obviously--and of course, the proverbial ""battle of the sexes,"" the subtext of just about EVERY Tracy-Hepburn film ever made).  And,yes, the baseball scene is pretty darn great.But the film is not an unqualified success.  The kitchen disaster scene towards the movie's end is cliched and just too darn slow.  The flying toast, the boiling over coffee and that cussed watched pot that keeps boiling over are enough to try the patience of almost any contemporary viewer.  Tracy is consigned to shameless mugging throughout the entire proceedings.  Probably not his fault.  I'm sure he was dutifully taking direction.  But director George Stephens' sense of pacing--so effective in the baseball scene--fails him here.The entire scene seems lifted from a THREE STOOGES short and is totally out of place with the sophisticated tone of the rest of the film.Many have pointed out that the shift from breezy comedy to near-melodrama is a bit jarring at times.  I would have to say that the writers deserve some credit for making the script a bit more nuanced than it might have been otherwise.  Hepburn's change-of-heart at her father's wedding is not entirely convincing, but interestingly enough Tracy is not entirely convinced either.  He calls her out on this very point.  Is it a true change of heart or merely another of her many self-dramatizing whims?And speaking of whims, am I the only viewer who found the segment with Chris, the young Greek orphan, kind of disturbing?  That Kate's ambitious Tess Harding character would feel almost obliged to adopt a young refugee (and foist the child on her unsuspecting husband) is dubious enough.  That she would neglect him on top of that, however, risks making her once charmingly eccentric character almost monstrous.In fact, I kept wondering about the kid even after the big reconciliation scene between the principles.  Did anyone think about going back to the orphanage and fetching the youngster and maybe starting a ""real"" family.  By the film's end, you feel that Sam and Tess Harding Craig are coming to terms with themselves and their marriage.  They get to start anew,and you're glad for them.

Overall he's a solid, unflappable fellow, but when he hears international columnist Tess Harding (Katherine Hepburn) support the abolition of baseball during wartime, he can't resist retaliating in print. The battle is soon joined, and it's not long before the editor calls them together for a cease-fire. One look at Tess, though, and Sam is a goner. Their mutual attraction can't be denied, and it's not long before they're married.But what is Sam in for? Tess' career has a life of its own, and he can barely get a moment with her alone. Most of the time, he's trailing in her wake along with countless diplomats, refugees and other international figures. While Sam is successful at his work, it's a world Tess has little time for - and it's not long before the relationship feels the strain.""Woman of the Year"" happily manages to avoid many of the pitfalls inherent in stories focused on sexual politics. While Tess' career is not endorsed as inherently fulfilling, typical gender roles aren't offered as the solution (however much Tess would like to believe they are). Indeed, the film asks for compromise and balance from its characters - in fact, no clear solution is reached by the film's end. It's up to the viewer to hope that they'll find one.One of the film's delights is that's precisely what you do wish. It's easy to see from their debut why Hepburn and Tracy went on to become one of cinema's most indelible teams, making eight more films together. Their deep mutual affection for one another (on and off the set) lights up the screen. It's a terrific, palpable energy.The screenplay won the Oscar for 1942, and it's a wonderful complement to the cast.

When it comes to the Spenser Tracy/Katherine Hepburn pairing, the word ""chemistry"" is used quite often.  The thing about it is, though, that this stuff goes way beyond chemistry.  This is real, honest-to-life drama.Spenser Tracy's character is utterly relatable.  He reacts and he does what it seems any guy of the era, or even today, would do in such a situation.  His character is torn between his absolute adoration of Tess, and the knowledge that not only will he never amount to what Tess is, he also is pretty much emasculated by her self-actualization.And for Katherine Hepburn, who plays Tess, there couldn't have been a better role.  Hepburn, who was naturally independent anyway, plays the role of a knowledgeable Woman's Woman without needing an extra breath.The thing about the films with these two are that they actually present a relationship, not just a courtship and a ""and then they lived happily ever after, for all time"" ending.  They show the real issues with communication, work, space, and borders, everything that must be understood about a person to make it work.  And they are absolutely adoring of each other.Just like in the later film, Adam's Rib (1949), this film presents the issues and friction in their relationship almost spectacularly well from both sides.  I can't say that this film was as good as Adam's Rib (George Steven's directing is just a tad off-balanced and the pacing is a little uneven), but at any rate it's a real joy to watch, from the beginning courting to the slapstick ending.--PolarisDiB",4,A joy!,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,1751,"['lot', 'reviews', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'like', 'talk', 'thing', 'called', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'when', 'two', 'actors', 'are', 'capable', 'really', 'presenting', 'true', 'real', 'life', 'emotions', 'When', 'Spenser', 'Tracy/Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'pairing', 'word', 'chemistry', 'used', 'quite', 'often', 'thing', 'though', 'stuff', 'way', 'chemistry', 'real', 'honest-to-life', 'drama.Spenser', 'Tracy', 'character', 'utterly', 'relatable', 'what', 'guy', 'era', 'even', 'today', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'character', 'torn', 'absolute', 'adoration', 'Tess', 'knowledge', 'not', 'only', 'will', 'never', 'amount', 'what', 'Tess', 'also', 'pretty', 'much', 'emasculated', 'self-actualization.And', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'who', 'Tess', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'role', 'Hepburn', 'who', 'was', 'naturally', 'independent', 'anyway', 'role', 'knowledgeable', 'Woman', 'Woman', 'needing', 'extra', 'breath.The', 'thing', 'films', 'two', 'are', 'actually', 'present', 'relationship', 'not', 'just', 'courtship', 'then', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'time', 'ending', 'show', 'real', 'issues', 'communication', 'work', 'space', 'borders', 'everything', 'must', 'be', 'understood', 'person', 'make', 'work', 'are', 'absolutely', 'adoring', 'other.Just', 'later', 'film', 'Adam', 'Rib', '1949', 'film', 'issues', 'friction', 'relationship', 'almost', 'spectacularly', 'well', 'sides', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'Adam', 'Rib', 'George', 'Steven', 'directing', 'just', 'tad', 'off-balanced', 'pacing', 'little', 'uneven', 'rate', 'real', 'joy', 'watch', 'beginning', 'courting', 'slapstick', 'ending.', 'PolarisDiB']",N/A
550648,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,B00004TJOE,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[2, 2]","This is the first of the nine movies Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn made together. The on-screen romance was carried over into their private lives that lasted 25 years. New York Times in its obituary column wrote ""Her life and career were dominated by her love affair with Spencer Tracy, which created one of the great romantic legends and brilliant movie pairings of their day."" Katharine Hepburn's independent life and strong-willed movie characters made her a role model for generations of young women for more than 60 years. Hepburn and Tracy became one of Hollywood's most recognizable couples. Hepburn had an agile mind and distinctive New England accent, which was complemented by Tracy's machismoWoman of the year is a light hearted romantic comedy, which examines the lives of professional couples and how it affects their private lives. As you can guess there is certain amount of drama in the midst of a love story. The beautiful, brilliant and independent journalist Tess Harding (Katharine Hepburn) and the macho sportswriter Sam Craig (Spencer Tracy) clash over whether athletic events should be suspended for the duration of the war.  She insists that sports column be abolished during war, but Sam believes that it is essential for morale. The editor brings them together to make peace but the pair when they see each other for the first time, they fall in love! When they start dating, things don't go easy on them. When Sam takes her to a ball game, Tess like the game, but when Tess introduces Sam to her international friends, he is not too thrilled. Nonetheless, they marry, but he quickly discovers she is so busy with her profession and that she has no time for him. When she adopts a war orphan without discussing with him, he realizes a drastic step must be taken, because she has no idea of being a wife and mother.There are some very funny scenes in the movie; one of my favorite is when Tess drives back to Sam's apartment while he is sleeping; she decides to prove herself as a wife and a good cook. Using a recipe book she prepares his breakfast, which awakens Sam, and he silently watches as everything goes wrong for Tess, she breakdown when coffeepot and waffle iron both overflow, and the kitchen get messy. Sam then embraces her and says he doesn't want to change her; he merely wants their marriage to come first. The ending is somewhat discomforting for modern day feminists as it sounds too anti-family to be an independent professional woman. After all, this movie was made for audience of the year 1942, and they wouldn't have a liked it any other way than a woman learns a lesson, finally, that she has to be a caring wife, and not just a professional journalist and a political activist.1.The Hepburn & Tracy Signature Collection (Woman of the Year / Pat and Mike / Adam's Rib / The Spencer Tracy Legacy)2.TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Romantic Comedies (Adam's Rib / Woman of the Year / The Philadelphia Story / Bringing Up Baby)3.Katharine Hepburn Collection (Morning Glory / Undercurrent / Sylvia Scarlett / Without Love / Dragon Seed / The Corn Is Green [1979])",4,"The ""odd couple"" love story",1257984000,"11 12, 2009",2009,3121,"['first', 'nine', 'movies', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'made', 'together', 'on-screen', 'romance', 'was', 'carried', 'private', 'lives', 'lasted', '25', 'years', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'obituary', 'column', 'wrote', 'life', 'career', 'were', 'dominated', 'love', 'affair', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'created', 'one', 'great', 'romantic', 'legends', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'pairings', 'day', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'independent', 'life', 'strong-willed', 'movie', 'characters', 'made', 'role', 'model', 'generations', 'young', 'women', 'more', '60', 'years', 'Hepburn', 'Tracy', 'became', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'recognizable', 'couples', 'Hepburn', 'had', 'agile', 'mind', 'distinctive', 'New', 'England', 'accent', 'was', 'complemented', 'Tracy', 'machismoWoman', 'year', 'light', 'hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'lives', 'professional', 'couples', 'how', 'private', 'lives', 'can', 'guess', 'certain', 'amount', 'drama', 'midst', 'love', 'story', 'beautiful', 'brilliant', 'independent', 'journalist', 'Tess', 'Harding', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'macho', 'sportswriter', 'Sam', 'Craig', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'clash', 'athletic', 'events', 'should', 'be', 'suspended', 'duration', 'war', 'sports', 'column', 'be', 'abolished', 'war', 'Sam', 'essential', 'morale', 'editor', 'together', 'make', 'peace', 'pair', 'when', 'see', 'other', 'first', 'time', 'fall', 'love', 'When', 'start', 'dating', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'easy', 'When', 'Sam', 'ball', 'game', 'Tess', 'game', 'when', 'Tess', 'Sam', 'international', 'friends', 'not', 'too', 'thrilled', 'Nonetheless', 'marry', 'quickly', 'so', 'busy', 'profession', 'time', 'When', 'war', 'orphan', 'discussing', 'drastic', 'step', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'idea', 'being', 'wife', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie', 'one', 'favorite', 'when', 'Tess', 'back', 'Sam', 'apartment', 'sleeping', 'prove', 'wife', 'good', 'cook', 'Using', 'recipe', 'book', 'breakfast', 'Sam', 'silently', 'everything', 'wrong', 'Tess', 'breakdown', 'when', 'coffeepot', 'waffle', 'iron', 'overflow', 'kitchen', 'get', 'messy', 'Sam', 'then', ""n't"", 'want', 'change', 'merely', 'marriage', 'come', 'first', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'discomforting', 'modern', 'day', 'too', 'anti-family', 'be', 'independent', 'professional', 'woman', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'audience', 'year', '1942', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'liked', 'other', 'way', 'woman', 'lesson', 'finally', 'be', 'caring', 'wife', 'not', 'just', 'professional', 'journalist', 'political', 'activist.1.The', 'Hepburn', 'Tracy', 'Signature', 'Collection', 'Woman', 'Year', '/', 'Pat', 'Mike', '/', 'Adam', 'Rib', '/', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Legacy', '2.TCM', 'Greatest', 'Classic', 'Films', 'Collection', 'Romantic', 'Comedies', 'Adam', 'Rib', '/', 'Woman', 'Year', '/', 'Philadelphia', 'Story', '/', 'Bringing', 'Up', 'Baby', '3.Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Collection', 'Morning', 'Glory', '/', 'Undercurrent', '/', 'Sylvia', 'Scarlett', '/', 'Without', 'Love', '/', 'Dragon', 'Seed', 'Corn', 'Is', 'Green', '[', '1979', ']']",N/A

Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[20, 21]","Aside from Hepburn &amp; Tracy's debut as a team, all credit should be given to director George Stevens for putting together this very complicated story so seamlessly. Mr. Stevens finally won an Oscar in 1951 for &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; and again in 1956 for &quot;Giant&quot;. After &quot;Woman ofthe Year&quot;, Stevens was nominated for &quot;The More the Merrier&quot;, another complicated plot that he handled with brilliance (remade in the 60's as a Cary Grant romp). Tracy &amp; Hepburn are wonderful (Kate getting a nomination), and Kate's pant-suits certainly must've made a fashion statement; Kate was certainly more comfortable in those clothes than the glamour girls of the time, and though not a great beauty, she was glamorous. I still don't understand why Kate became &quot;box-office poison&quot; in the late 30's; I thought she was brilliant in &quot;Stage Door&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;. I don't see any difference in her choice of roles as with Irene Dunne, who did crazy comedy (&quot;The Awful Truth&quot;) as well as sensitive drama (&quot;Love Affair&quot;). Who's to say what tastes were at the time? Though &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; has a few slow, serious moments, it's the light-hearted moments that hold interest. It won an Oscar for Screenplay, much deserved by Michael Kanin and the later black-listed Ring Lardner, Jr. And there's a particularly lovely performance from Fay Bainter who seemed to be over-looked. I enjoy this film for many reasons; it was timely, due to its release during the WWII years, as well as attacking attitudes of society which are today ever-present.

550650,A2U0ABMZK6XBVF,B00004TJOE,"Richard A. Tucker ""Tucker at large""","[2, 3]","What's surprising about this film is it's age. Despite the enormous social changes that have occurred since this film was made (6 decades?) it's funny how these two characters could still be genuinely portrayed today. This character study of a socially and politically sophisticated woman, very well respected locally and globally for her charm, brains and political savvy ways, and her odd love for a regular guy who almost becomes a novelty to her after their marriage is not far cry from what could be made today. Spencer Tracy, as a newspaper sportswriter, crosses into the world of a social sophisticate played by Katherine Hepburn through an argument over some glib comments she makes about baseball which makes it into her radio address. Despite their differences there is a spark. That spark is nurtured by both of them until it becomes a passion leading to a brief but poignant romance. Once married, however, they are too different from each other. This wouldn't be so bad but Hepburn's character, rather than resolving the issues between them decides to resume her life and it's time consuming pace leaving her understanding but frustrated husband to his own pursuits while he evidently would rather have more of her attention. It comes down to a question of what a person wants. Hepburn's &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; is used to doing things her way and doesn't understand her commitment to making a marriage. This comes to head and the film makes a brave attempt to resolve these differences. Katherine's character is not an ice queen but a motivated person who's used to having her own life. Spencer's character is a sincere guy who's married to woman who has a demanding life who doesn't balance her time between home and career. In the end she realizes that she's not the perfect person and tries to bring her marriage back from the brink of failure. He cautions her that life is not as simple as just walking away from commitments and learning how to cook and expects her to make compromises not sacrifices.While there is some silly kitchen scenes at the end it's really an effort by the director to point out the futility of a person suddenly trying to reinvent herself. Her husband doesn't expect too much even if he's not a great motivational speaker. He also doesn't blame her for her plight but lets her know that she has options she has to consider. Reverse these rolls and it's easy to see how this film works on the two levels. If this were a man there would be no doubt that the woman was making sense. This film is almost revolutionary. It turns the tables on social roles at a time when people weren't even aware there was a table.",5,A high mark the history of film making,1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,2660,"['What', 'surprising', 'film', 'age', 'enormous', 'social', 'changes', 'have', 'occurred', 'film', 'was', 'made', '6', 'decades', 'funny', 'how', 'two', 'characters', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'genuinely', 'portrayed', 'today', 'character', 'study', 'socially', 'politically', 'sophisticated', 'woman', 'very', 'well', 'respected', 'locally', 'globally', 'charm', 'brains', 'political', 'savvy', 'ways', 'odd', 'love', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'almost', 'novelty', 'marriage', 'not', 'far', 'cry', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'today', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'newspaper', 'sportswriter', 'world', 'social', 'sophisticate', 'played', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'argument', 'glib', 'comments', 'baseball', 'radio', 'address', 'differences', 'spark', 'spark', 'nurtured', 'passion', 'leading', 'brief', 'poignant', 'romance', 'Once', 'married', 'however', 'are', 'too', 'different', 'other', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'Hepburn', 'character', 'rather', 'resolving', 'issues', 'resume', 'life', 'time', 'consuming', 'pace', 'leaving', 'understanding', 'frustrated', 'husband', 'own', 'pursuits', 'evidently', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'more', 'attention', 'down', 'question', 'what', 'person', 'Hepburn', 'quot', 'Woman', 'Year', 'quot', 'used', 'doing', 'things', 'way', ""n't"", 'understand', 'commitment', 'making', 'marriage', 'head', 'film', 'brave', 'attempt', 'resolve', 'differences', 'Katherine', 'character', 'not', 'ice', 'queen', 'motivated', 'person', 'who', 'used', 'having', 'own', 'life', 'Spencer', 'character', 'sincere', 'guy', 'who', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'demanding', 'life', 'who', ""n't"", 'balance', 'time', 'home', 'career', 'end', 'not', 'perfect', 'person', 'tries', 'bring', 'marriage', 'back', 'brink', 'failure', 'life', 'not', 'as', 'simple', 'just', 'walking', 'away', 'commitments', 'learning', 'how', 'cook', 'make', 'compromises', 'not', 'silly', 'kitchen', 'scenes', 'end', 'really', 'effort', 'director', 'point', 'out', 'futility', 'person', 'suddenly', 'trying', 'reinvent', 'husband', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'even', 'not', 'great', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'also', ""n't"", 'blame', 'plight', 'know', 'options', 'consider', 'Reverse', 'rolls', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'two', 'levels', 'were', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'doubt', 'woman', 'was', 'making', 'sense', 'film', 'almost', 'revolutionary', 'tables', 'social', 'roles', 'time', 'when', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'was', 'table']",N/A

550653,A3P6XT8Y1FEF3,B00004TJOE,Seamus,"[7, 8]","I LOVE the young version of Katherine Hepburn.  She was beautiful in an atypical way and was perfect at playing the coquette, something many people may not know if they've only seen her in her older, spinster rolls.  You can certainly see that side of her in this movie, but even Hepburn's charm or real life chemistry with Spencer Tracy can't elevate this film above average.  If you want to see her really shine, check out ""Bringing Up Baby"" or the ""The Philadelphia Story.""The basic premise of the movie is that you have a romantic comedy dealing with role reversal--the woman, Hepburn, is the successful one who's worried about her career, and the man, Spencer Tracy, is the second banana with the unimportant job.  Both of them are reporters working for the same paper, but this movie doesn't have any of the snappy dialog you might see in a movie like ""His Girl Friday.""The premise of the movie was probably original for it's time, but the problem is the execution.  For one, the movie is two long--nearly two hours while most comedies are around 90 minutes.  And that extra time isn't filled with good dialog or screwball scenes...instead you get a few long, drawn out attempts at romance that just seem to go on for too long.  It doesn't hold your interest.That isn't to say it's a bad movie--it's just somewhat forgettable.

550654,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,B00004TJOE,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[3, 5]","George Stevens' ""Woman of the Year"" is a romantic comedy mixed with social commentary.  Between the laughs is mixed in a pair of messages:  (1) that success in life can feel somewhat empty if you have no one to share it with, and (2) a domestic home life can prove to be a daunting challenge to even the most accomplished of public figures.Newspaper columnist Tess Harding (Katharine Hepburn) is drawn into a good natured war of words with a co-worker over comments she made during a radio show.  Although entertaining to readers, the printed jabs hurled between her and sportswriter Sam Craig (Spencer Tracy) comes to an abrupt end when their boss makes it clear he wants his newspaper writers to maintain a united front to the public.  During this announcement, the two writers meet for the first time and become smitten with one another.  Although Tess and Sam seemingly have nothing in common, they grow closer and eventually marry.  However, problems begin almost immediately as Tess is unable to comprehend the importance of being married and Sam becomes frustrated with her inability to keep her work life and home life separate.  Tess, however, soon gains some valuable insight into her situation when she attends her father's wedding and soon Tess and Sam are reunited with a much better understanding of their relationship.Watching Hepburn and Tracy work their magic on screen gives ""Woman of the Year"" a special charm.  Yet the film produces some mixed reactions.  Despite the quality of its performances and its addressing of relevant social issues, its messages come across as a little misguided.  The film implies that a successful career and a fulfilling domestic life are incompatible for women.  To make matters worse, the screwball manner in which Tess is portrayed in the last third of the film causes the film to lose more of its luster.  It seems that the intent was to add in more comedy to the final act to help offset the mounting drama, but the comedy comes at the expense of undermining Tess' character.  The positive role model she created for women up to this point is washed away as the bumbling Tess finds it difficult to accomplish such simple tasks as lighting a stove or making toast.  Yet, despite this unfortunate turn of events, ""Woman of the Year"" is still an entertaining film.  The writing is sharp for the most part and the baseball game sequence is a classic.  Tracy's final scene in the film is also great as he finally lets Tess' personal assistant know what he really thinks of him.  Chalk up ""Woman of the Year"" as a film that fell short of its aspirations but is still solid entertainment nonetheless.",3,"""I've just launched Gerald.""",1060387200,"08 9, 2003",2003,2647,"['George', 'Stevens', 'Woman', 'Year', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'mixed', 'social', 'commentary', 'laughs', 'mixed', 'pair', 'messages', '1', 'success', 'life', 'can', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'empty', 'have', 'one', 'share', '2', 'domestic', 'home', 'life', 'can', 'prove', 'be', 'daunting', 'challenge', 'even', 'most', 'accomplished', 'public', 'figures.Newspaper', 'columnist', 'Tess', 'Harding', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'drawn', 'good', 'natured', 'war', 'words', 'co-worker', 'comments', 'made', 'radio', 'show', 'entertaining', 'readers', 'printed', 'jabs', 'hurled', 'sportswriter', 'Sam', 'Craig', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'abrupt', 'end', 'when', 'boss', 'clear', 'newspaper', 'writers', 'maintain', 'united', 'front', 'public', 'announcement', 'two', 'writers', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'become', 'smitten', 'one', 'Tess', 'Sam', 'seemingly', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', 'grow', 'closer', 'eventually', 'marry', 'However', 'problems', 'begin', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Tess', 'unable', 'comprehend', 'importance', 'being', 'married', 'Sam', 'becomes', 'frustrated', 'inability', 'keep', 'work', 'life', 'home', 'life', 'separate', 'Tess', 'however', 'soon', 'gains', 'valuable', 'insight', 'situation', 'when', 'father', 'wedding', 'soon', 'Tess', 'Sam', 'are', 'reunited', 'much', 'better', 'understanding', 'relationship.Watching', 'Hepburn', 'Tracy', 'work', 'magic', 'screen', 'Woman', 'Year', 'special', 'charm', 'film', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'quality', 'performances', 'addressing', 'relevant', 'social', 'issues', 'messages', 'come', 'little', 'misguided', 'film', 'successful', 'career', 'fulfilling', 'domestic', 'life', 'are', 'incompatible', 'women', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'screwball', 'manner', 'Tess', 'portrayed', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'film', 'lose', 'more', 'luster', 'intent', 'was', 'add', 'more', 'comedy', 'final', 'act', 'help', 'offset', 'mounting', 'drama', 'comedy', 'expense', 'undermining', 'Tess', 'character', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'created', 'women', 'up', 'point', 'washed', 'away', 'bumbling', 'Tess', 'difficult', 'accomplish', 'such', 'simple', 'tasks', 'lighting', 'stove', 'making', 'toast', 'unfortunate', 'turn', 'events', 'Woman', 'Year', 'still', 'entertaining', 'film', 'writing', 'sharp', 'most', 'part', 'baseball', 'game', 'sequence', 'classic', 'Tracy', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'finally', 'Tess', 'personal', 'assistant', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'Chalk', 'Woman', 'Year', 'film', 'fell', 'short', 'aspirations', 'still', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'nonetheless']",N/A
