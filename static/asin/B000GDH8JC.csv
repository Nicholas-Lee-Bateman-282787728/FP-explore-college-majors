Season 2 DVD is actually Season 3 ( I am guessing because all the stars David Charvet, Nicole Eggert, Pam Anderson are featured). You also get 3 episodes from Season 1.Baywatch was the most popular TV show on the planet in the 1990's. Apparently, Hasselhoff couldnt secure rights to certain songs, so the wonderful original theme song has been replaced by a Hoff original (which is horrible).  For under $20 this DVD collection is well worth the price.",4,Great DVD Collection.,1162771200,"11 6, 2006",2006,522,"['Excellent', 'Transfer', 'DVD', 'Video', 'crisp', 'sound', 'above', 'average', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'actually', 'Season', '3', 'am', 'guessing', 'stars', 'David', 'Charvet', 'Nicole', 'Eggert', 'Pam', 'Anderson', 'are', 'featured', 'also', 'get', '3', 'episodes', 'Season', '1.Baywatch', 'was', 'most', 'popular', 'TV', 'show', 'planet', '1990', 'Apparently', 'Hasselhoff', 'secure', 'rights', 'certain', 'songs', 'wonderful', 'original', 'theme', 'song', 'been', 'replaced', 'Hoff', 'original', 'horrible', '20', 'DVD', 'collection', 'well', 'price']",Baywatch - Season 2

I now have seasons 1-3 and will be purchasing more as they become available at a good price. Only one problem - disc four has definite problems with episodes two and three - I could not watch them in their entirety due to defects in the disc.,4,Baywatch - season 2,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,327,"['Baywatch', 'season', '2', 'good', 'series', 'lifeguards', 'good', 'stories', 'cast', 'now', 'have', 'seasons', '1-3', 'will', 'be', 'purchasing', 'more', 'become', 'available', 'good', 'price', 'Only', 'one', 'problem', 'disc', 'four', 'definite', 'problems', 'episodes', 'two', 'three', 'could', 'not', 'watch', 'entirety', 'due', 'defects', 'disc']",Baywatch - Season 2

The fact that the show is from the 90's isn't an excuse - I've bought DVDs of show from the 60's [some of them ""colorized"" B&W;], and they look much better. I agree with all the criticisms about the theme - even if they couldn't get the rights to the original theme, they still could have found something much better.Hopefully when they release the other seasons they'll do a much better job.",2,Disappointing picture quality,1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,485,"['picture', 'quality', 'worse', 'reruns', 'TV', '[', 'Analog', 'Cable', 'Low', 'definition', ']', 'fact', 'show', '90', ""n't"", 'excuse', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'DVDs', 'show', '60', '[', 'colorized', 'B', 'W', ']', 'look', 'much', 'better', 'agree', 'criticisms', 'theme', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'rights', 'original', 'theme', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'something', 'much', 'better.Hopefully', 'when', 'release', 'other', 'seasons', ""'ll"", 'do', 'much', 'better', 'job']",Baywatch - Season 2

The episodes are mixed in with a later season.  For reasons like this one, I really try to get DVD's from the library.  I am so glad I didn't buy this.  The picture quality is good to me.  Maybe because I am older than when the show originally aired, the show seems slow to me.  I have found this with some of the shows I actually bought, like the Dukes of Hazard and Greatest American Hero.  They just aren't the same.  I rate Baywatch as a 1 because of the changing of the music and because the shows seem like they are in random order.",1,I would be upset if I actually paid for this!,1300060800,"03 14, 2011",2011,628,"['What', 'heck', 'music', 'first', 'disappointment', 'not', 'season', '2', 'episodes', 'are', 'mixed', 'later', 'season', 'reasons', 'one', 'really', 'try', 'get', 'DVD', 'library', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'Maybe', 'am', 'older', 'when', 'show', 'originally', 'aired', 'show', 'slow', 'have', 'found', 'shows', 'actually', 'bought', 'Dukes', 'Hazard', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'same', 'rate', 'Baywatch', '1', 'changing', 'music', 'shows', 'seem', 'are', 'random', 'order']",Baywatch - Season 2
