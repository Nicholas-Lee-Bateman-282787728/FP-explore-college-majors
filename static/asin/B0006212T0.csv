Anyone can dance and learn steps, but it is how these artists work that sets them apart.  They become the characters and we forget they are real people.  They bring us momentarily into this unreal fantasy world which they create so well.  This is what I enjoyed about this performance.  Lynn Seymour is a great dance actress and Nureyev is so intense that there is not a dull moment here.",5,Andromeda,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,571,"['observer', 'art', 'appreciator', 'great', 'artists', 'found', 'be', 'rare', 'insight', 'craft', 'two', 'dancers', 'how', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'terms', 'style', 'Anyone', 'can', 'dance', 'learn', 'steps', 'how', 'artists', 'work', 'apart', 'become', 'characters', 'forget', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'bring', 'momentarily', 'unreal', 'fantasy', 'world', 'create', 'so', 'well', 'what', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'Lynn', 'Seymour', 'great', 'dance', 'actress', 'Nureyev', 'so', 'intense', 'not', 'dull', 'moment', 'here']","Adam - Giselle / Malakhov, Vasileva, Kremlin State Theatre Ballet Academy"

On the positive side, the fact that the performance was filmed in a studio enabled the stage designers to do more with sets and camera angles, to enhance dramatic effect.  The dancers use mime to a greater extent in this performance than in other versions of Giselle currently available on video.  Lynn Seymour is endearing, but her technical capabilities were obviously not equal to the demands of the role (why was she cast instead of a younger dancer?).  Nureyev does not seem to have decided whether to play Albrecht as designing cad or a lovestruck suitor.  His dancing is OK, but if you want to see some of the weaknesses in his technique, this performance will provide the opportunity.  In any case, he also looks too old for the role.  Monica Mason is excellent as Myrtha and the staging of the entrance of the wilis at the beginning of Act II is highly effective.  Be sure to watch one of the longer versions of Giselle, available on DVD, to see the dancing cut from this version.",3,Mixed feelings...,1271289600,"04 15, 2010",2010,1112,"['version', 'Giselle', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'so', 'much', 'dancing', 'was', 'cut', 'first', 'second', 'acts', 'positive', 'side', 'fact', 'performance', 'was', 'filmed', 'studio', 'enabled', 'stage', 'designers', 'do', 'more', 'sets', 'camera', 'angles', 'enhance', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'dancers', 'use', 'mime', 'greater', 'extent', 'performance', 'other', 'versions', 'Giselle', 'currently', 'available', 'video', 'Lynn', 'Seymour', 'endearing', 'technical', 'capabilities', 'were', 'obviously', 'not', 'equal', 'demands', 'role', 'why', 'was', 'cast', 'instead', 'younger', 'dancer', 'Nureyev', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'decided', 'play', 'Albrecht', 'designing', 'cad', 'lovestruck', 'suitor', 'dancing', 'OK', 'want', 'see', 'weaknesses', 'technique', 'performance', 'will', 'provide', 'opportunity', 'case', 'also', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'Monica', 'Mason', 'excellent', 'Myrtha', 'staging', 'entrance', 'wilis', 'beginning', 'Act', 'II', 'highly', 'effective', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'one', 'longer', 'versions', 'Giselle', 'available', 'DVD', 'see', 'dancing', 'cut', 'version']","Adam - Giselle / Malakhov, Vasileva, Kremlin State Theatre Ballet Academy"

855873,A23L7IH3XVRFHY,B0006212T0,"Esteban Molina ""soaringpiglet""","[33, 35]","I own many performances of ""Giselle"" but this is, by far, my favorite.  It's possible to find a DVD performance with a more stellar touch here or there; but, overall, this performance is as close to perfection in all aspects of production as one is likely to find.  High praise, I know, but I think it's merited.There is an overall ""ensemble"" feel to this performance.  Everyone seems to be operating at the same level of excellence and commitment and on the same ""wave"" as to interpretation.  The synchronization of the corps - whether manifested by a single couple, several couples together or the whole company - is exceptional.  Quite honestly, I have seen productions by world-famous companies (no names mentioned) which fall far, far below the standards exhibited by this company.  If they dance like this all the time, they should be at the top of anyone's list!Not only are they together as a group, but there is a singular grace and ease to their dancing that one doesn't always see.  They are, in fact, so unified in style and execution that one can easily overlook just how wonderful they are.  They make it seem so easy and normative that one forgets how exceptional what they do really is.  I wish I knew more about the different national ""schools""; but there is something about this performance as a whole and in the individual style of each dancer which reminds me of Russia.  There isn't a moment of stiffness in anything they do, no matter how complicated; easeful, fluid grace is the best I can do as a description, and they seem to enjoy what they're doing.  If the steps are racking them with pain, there is not the slightest indication of it for the audience.If you want a minus, then I single out the boorish behaviour of the audience, especially in Act 2, for special note.  Seldom have I heard such disrespect from an audience for its fellows or for the artists as this one manifests.  What do I mean?  Coughing.  My god, you'd think the whole performance had been filmed in a tubercular ward.  But even with that the performance is so magical that one can forget such behavioural interruptions.I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that, once I've watched a DVD of Giselle, I normally skip over all but the beginning and ending of Act 1 and go straight to the real glory, Act 2.  BUT...in the case of this performance, I have found myself watching the whole of Act 1 because it was just so very lovely, graceful and joyful to watch.  What more can I say?  I suppose you might not like this performance, so individual is preference; but I find it hard to believe in this case that anyone will be disappointed in owning such a ""Giselle"".Highest marks.

This particular piece has numerous flaws, choreographic, dramatic, and technical.  The latter are the most irksome for the casual viewer.  The color is a washed-out sepia in the first act, and the second act is danced in near-pitch darkness.  The sound is muffled, and the orchestra is sub-par.

This performance and presentation are nearly perfect.  The image quality is great and the sound quality is excellent.  The only flaw is that the color intensity is a little weak, which gives it a slight sepia appearance, which is not really a bad thing for a period piece.  The orchestral version used here is a little unusual.  It may be the edition they used.  It has a very clear chamber orchestra quality enhanced by excellent microphone placement and good engineering.The peasant pas de deux is actually danced by Seymour and Nureyev, themselves, typically Nureyev.  The choreography he uses for this part is quite interesting.  Nureyev is in classic form here and he looks like he's enjoying himself, as is the rest of this excellent cast( the corps, too!).  Nureyev was a very fine ballet actor and his mime(which includes all non-dance modes of expression) is great here.  In the beginning of the first act he is very amusing in the way he tells his servant not to worry about his little adventure to come.

855876,A1ZXF4ZRLXV2YT,B0006212T0,King Arthur,"[12, 13]","The other reviewers in rating this production as 5 Star, as I have, have commented about this classic ballet up, down, backwards and sideways.  In short this beautiful ballet, as an example of the art of ballet, has been fully explored.  To a viewer, seeking reasons why he/she should buy or pass on this ballet performance gains nothing by my adding another dollop to a full plate of praise.  Instead, I focus on the Ballerina: the raison d'etre - the primary reason why you and I buy a ballet recording .Ballet is a unique intellectual, artistic confection.  It is an art form which tells a gripping story to the viewer (if successfully done) within a highly confining artistic format:  the ballerina, and all the performers, must participate in the telling of a story WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD!  Current Emotions, and Anticipatory Emotions must be expressed (a) through an understanding of the art of mime, (b) the ability to perform effectively in this unique art form (c)in concert with the underlying music, and (d) all coordinated within  a pattern of  intricate dance steps and physical movements, - some requiring a large order of physical strength (e)a memory for detail and (f) an exquisite sense of timing, namely to understand, and obey the choreographer's work product. For it is the choreographer who takes all these disparate elements, and, if successful, melds them into an eye catching, heart warming whole.  All this expository material said, I turn to my reason for writing this review.  I've fsllen in love with Anna Tsygankova, a Queen among the of Giselles!  I knew nothing of Anna until a few days earlier. I had seen her for the first time in this same Dutch Ballet Company's version of Don Quichot.  I marveled at her dancing skills, and enjoyed her effervescent personality.  However her role as Kitri was a comic role, which Ms. Tsygankova carried off very well. It wasn't until I viewed her in this DVD of Giselle that I saw the full range of her artistry.  Her dancing and miming in Don Quichot were superb.  But in this performance of Giselle the interrelationship of her dancing and her miming were exquisite! And essential, were the ballet's love story to be effectively told.  Each art form, dancing and miming,  as done by Anna, buttressed the other, creating a beautiful, heart rending, indelible performance of an old, but ever young romantic ballet. Bravo Anna, Star Ballerina!  Anna Tsygankova you have brought me much pleasure! Thank you!. King Arthur.

Almost no peasant dances and a condensed 2nd act also, for which there could be NO excuse. That's why we buy ""Giselle"" for goodness sake. I bought this version on Ivy Lin's recommendation, knowing for instance, that Lynn Seymour was a little heavy. In spite of that she played a beautiful Giselle, and I'm sure there are a few heavy weights out there who can identify with her. The only thing she could not do was fly, but her dancing was good, she looked good in her mad scene, and rather than hiding her face in her hands, like some, she acted her part with expression. I felt sympathy for her Giselle. A lot has been said about the fact that Giselle kills herself with Albrecht's sword, and the act of suicide is not how the original version portrayed her death. In all five of my versions, suicide is used. Death from a broken heart would be more heart rending for us, but actresses who could convince us would be hard to find. The only two I've seen who have come close to convincing me is Karen Kain in the Canadian version and Christine Walsh in the Australian Ballet version. I think (correct me if I'm wrong) some Churches forbid burial on so called sacred ground (Church cemetery) when suicide is the cause of death, which is the reason Giselle is buried on unconsecrated ground in the Forest. Even though she didn't commit suicide, the Christine Walsh ""Giselle"" was also buried on unconsecrated ground in a Forest glade. My understanding is, that because of her act of forgiveness, Giselle freed her spirit of wondering the dark  Forests for all eternity with Myrtha and the other Wilis.Monica Mason IS Myrtha (Meer-ta). She is the best Myrtha of them all. Scary is the word for it. The lighting added to the eerie atmosphere of the night-time Forrest, as everything is back-lit, except for low intensity spotlights on the principles. Some of the white dancing in the 2nd act was abbreviated so much and the music was sped up to the point that if you blinked you are apt to miss the spectacular dance of the Wilis when they hop on one foot in the arabesque. I have never heard that music played so fast in any Giselle. It is so beautiful, why not slow it down instead? Lynn's Giselle shows a tender forgiveness for Albrecht's carelessness in love. I have wondered, however, if the Princess Bathilde, his former fiance, ever forgives him. I have heard that there is a version showing her (Bathilde) coming to reclaim Albrecht. Does anyone know?This was a film sound stage production, and may not have had a live orchestra. It certainly had no audience. It is claimed to be Dolby 2.0 sound. The video format is 4:3 ratio.P.S. I now have a sixth version of Giselle by the Australian Ballet, staring Christine Walsh, and Kelvin Coe. I found it on Amazon.UK. I have been looking for another ballet with Christine Walsh for a year, and fortunately found this one, which is very good. The Australian Ballet version is the only version in my collection of six, where Giselle does NOT stab herself with Albrecht's sword. She attempts to, but is prevented by Albrecht. She dies of heart failure, and is quite convincing in her portrayal of a frail young girl with a weak heart, and driven to utter destruction by anxiety and betrayal. Her mad scene is very well done, but the producers foolishly had her in close-up when she picked the Daisey for the ""he loves me, he loves me not"" portion of the mad scene.",4,A common man's point of view.,1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,3574,"['hope', 'have', 'read', 'above', 'reviews', 'have', 'good', 'points', 'consider.My', 'only', 'objection', 'ballet', 'length', 'only', '78', 'minutes', 'Almost', 'peasant', 'dances', 'condensed', '2nd', 'act', 'also', 'could', 'be', 'NO', 'excuse', 'why', 'buy', 'Giselle', 'goodness', 'sake', 'bought', 'version', 'Ivy', 'Lin', 'recommendation', 'knowing', 'instance', 'Lynn', 'Seymour', 'was', 'little', 'heavy', 'spite', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Giselle', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'few', 'heavy', 'weights', 'who', 'can', 'identify', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'was', 'fly', 'dancing', 'was', 'good', 'looked', 'good', 'mad', 'scene', 'rather', 'hiding', 'face', 'hands', 'acted', 'part', 'expression', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'Giselle', 'lot', 'been', 'said', 'fact', 'Giselle', 'Albrecht', 'sword', 'act', 'suicide', 'not', 'how', 'original', 'version', 'portrayed', 'death', 'five', 'versions', 'suicide', 'used', 'Death', 'broken', 'heart', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'heart', 'rending', 'actresses', 'who', 'could', 'convince', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'only', 'two', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'convincing', 'Karen', 'Kain', 'Canadian', 'version', 'Christine', 'Walsh', 'Australian', 'Ballet', 'version', 'think', 'correct', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'Churches', 'forbid', 'burial', 'so', 'called', 'sacred', 'ground', 'Church', 'cemetery', 'when', 'suicide', 'cause', 'death', 'reason', 'Giselle', 'buried', 'unconsecrated', 'ground', 'Forest', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'suicide', 'Christine', 'Walsh', 'Giselle', 'was', 'also', 'buried', 'unconsecrated', 'ground', 'Forest', 'glade', 'understanding', 'act', 'forgiveness', 'Giselle', 'freed', 'spirit', 'wondering', 'dark', 'Forests', 'eternity', 'Myrtha', 'other', 'Wilis.Monica', 'Mason', 'IS', 'Myrtha', 'Meer-ta', 'best', 'Myrtha', 'Scary', 'word', 'lighting', 'added', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'night-time', 'Forrest', 'everything', 'back-lit', 'low', 'intensity', 'spotlights', 'principles', 'white', 'dancing', '2nd', 'act', 'was', 'abbreviated', 'so', 'much', 'music', 'was', 'sped', 'up', 'point', 'blinked', 'are', 'apt', 'miss', 'spectacular', 'dance', 'Wilis', 'when', 'hop', 'one', 'foot', 'arabesque', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'music', 'played', 'so', 'fast', 'Giselle', 'so', 'beautiful', 'why', 'not', 'slow', 'down', 'instead', 'Lynn', 'Giselle', 'tender', 'forgiveness', 'Albrecht', 'carelessness', 'love', 'have', 'wondered', 'however', 'Princess', 'Bathilde', 'former', 'fiance', 'ever', 'have', 'heard', 'version', 'showing', 'Bathilde', 'coming', 'reclaim', 'Albrecht', 'Does', 'anyone', 'know', 'was', 'film', 'sound', 'stage', 'production', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'live', 'orchestra', 'certainly', 'had', 'audience', 'claimed', 'be', 'Dolby', '2.0', 'sound', 'video', 'format', '4:3', 'ratio.P.S', 'now', 'have', 'sixth', 'version', 'Giselle', 'Australian', 'Ballet', 'staring', 'Christine', 'Walsh', 'Kelvin', 'Coe', 'found', 'Amazon.UK', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'ballet', 'Christine', 'Walsh', 'year', 'fortunately', 'found', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'Australian', 'Ballet', 'version', 'only', 'version', 'collection', 'six', 'where', 'Giselle', 'NOT', 'stab', 'Albrecht', 'sword', 'prevented', 'Albrecht', 'heart', 'failure', 'quite', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'frail', 'young', 'girl', 'weak', 'heart', 'driven', 'utter', 'destruction', 'anxiety', 'betrayal', 'mad', 'scene', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'producers', 'foolishly', 'had', 'close-up', 'when', 'picked', 'Daisey', 'not', 'portion', 'mad', 'scene']","Adam - Giselle / Malakhov, Vasileva, Kremlin State Theatre Ballet Academy"

No.. not anywhere as convincing as Cojocaru, not because of her dancing, but her attitude towards Giselle. She has to take a leaf out of Cojocaru insofar as acting is concerned, although her technique and dancing seem absolutely flawless... Tsygankova seems to be more in the Zakharova mold, which requires shedding of a few pounds of ego.The Mad scene is nowhere as good as Cojocaru's in the ROH production.But Myrta? Jongh can give the best of the best a run for the money. She is one of the best ever Myrthas that I have seen, Marianella Nunez notwithstanding.Yes, as some critics have pointed out that the second act seems devoid of overt emotions as Nunez is so successful in bringing out, but Jongh comes through without having to exert herself in observable expressions to bring out the cold blooded intents.The conductor has done a great job with the music, and the recording, unlike in the ROH version, is far far better. The choreographers have worked overtime to present some dances different from the other productions, without losing any artistic stuff. Thank them for it. The corps de ballet seems to be extremely well utilized, and dance beautifully, without being mechanical in the first act dances. They seem to be having fun as peasants, without inhibitions and dance thus.....NOTE:- If one has a complete version of the Giselle on a CD audio, one will immediately notice that this version has many more beautiful numbers committed to dance, that almost ALL other productions of it neglect, especially in the Act 1 in the pas de quatre and towards the end. The treatment of music is very beautiful, elaborate bordering on the ornate..... rare, I would say....All in all, a perfect companion to the ROH production, which ironically, I have given one star less than this, for very different reasons.

Based on those reviews, I purchased and watched, and glad that I did.I was initially hesitant to buy this because a couple of other reviewers mentioned some disturbing, rude coughing audible during the second act. But, I heard no coughing whatsoever.  I have a pretty high-end sound system and watched at full room volume, so feel I would have noticed the coughing, if it had been present. I was listening using the 5.1 surround mode.  Don't know if there might be a difference if I had used stereo.  Is it possible that the engineers who produced this were able to re-mix and eliminate the problem?  Don't know.  All I know is that the disc I received had no problems.Special note should also be given to the dancing of Jozef Vargo.  There is a tendency to focus on the dancing of Giselle herself, to the exclusion of Albrecht.  Tsygankova's Giselle is superb in interpretation, with a light, weightless, delicacy of dancing that is wonderful to watch.  But don't ignore Vargo.  He also exhibits a weightless, delicacy of dancing to match Gidelle's with a caring, gentle, supportive demeanor that I found very appealing. In summary, this new blu-ray version with Tsygankova and Varga at the Dutch National Opera is a step above other performances I've seen, a true masterpiece of chemistry, artistic sensitivity and technical virtuosity.  Superb, just about perfect filming and editing as well.

855883,AOMEZP13H0MQC,B0006212T0,Warmgoy,"[14, 16]","I must agree with the reviewer Linn on just about all respects. The performance is not bad, nothing is embarassing, but - particularly given the DVD is offerred at full price - one can do much better elsewhere (try the Scala/Ferri at full price, on a budget go for the Boshoi performance, which I'm not crazy about, but it's much better than this one, and about half the price). The technical presentation is rather poor to begin with. Sound quality is quite boxy, and the orchestral performance is quite mediocre to be honest, some really glaring bloopers from the brass section in the music for the nobles, though there is an interesting lift to certain passages, such as the grapepicker's theme. Camera work is amateurish. There is an overuse of the kind of close up filmed performances are obsessed with, and that are most unfortunante in ballet when we do want to see the dancer's feet, after all. As if in response to this, many shots are done from the opposite extreme, as though the camera were placed in the last row of the balcony, seeming a city block away from the stage (not to mention a problem with someone's head passing by the camera a couple of times.) The performers seem uninspired. Malakhov is by far the highlight, and as pointed out, has not yet aquired the polish that might have lent the performance more grace. Much the same can be said for Vasileva, there is a straightforward charm to her characterization, but a sense of insecurity, and a lack of fluidity in Act II, when Giselle needs it the most. I rather liked the Hilareon, though The Russian practice is utilized of featuring him more prominently in the Act one ensembles than is generally seen, and the dancer does not quite seize the opportunity. Someone also needed to take him aside and redo his eye makeup. The physical production does not fare well on camera, it is a touch drab, and a bit cheap looking. Audience response is tepid throughout, and for some reason.If you found this in an overstock bin, or if it was going for mid-price, this performance might have more going for it, but with the other options available, this is simply not a competetive version.Wow, you would think I was really cranky today reading this, and I'm not.
