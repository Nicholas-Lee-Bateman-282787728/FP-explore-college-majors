Cecena ""ssjanifan""","[22, 23]","The second movie definitely provided us a bit of a change of a pace by showing how the heroes would go if they ever defeated Naraku, but this one definitely rocks the usual formula.  Starting with a flashback that goes to the night Inuyasha was born, offering a bit into the past of his father, we go to present day in the series.  A deadly sword called Sounga is awakened and starts its destruction by destroying Kagome's hometown(!).  It then possesses Inuyasha, turns him evil, and sets him on a destruction spree in the Feudal Era(double !!).  Eventually though, the sword settles on a new host... Takemaru, a deceased lord who hated Inuyasha and Sesshomaru's father, and in a nice touch of continuity allows him to wield the sword by giving him Sesshomaru's decapitated arm.  Both brothers want to destroy the sword on their own, but the only possible way is to work together.  Can Inuyasha and Sesshomaru, along with the usual gang, as well as Totosai believe it or not, actually defeat their deadliest threat yet?  The story is good and the entire film is well animated, especially the battle scenes.  The usual voice cast, for both versions, is also great as usual.  As the other two films did, there is a ""behind the series"" featurette that's told entirely in Japanese that recaps all the importants events that lead up to the film.  There's also all the theatrical trailers, as well as one for the 4th film if you watch long enough.  Inuyasha fans should definitely check this out.  Some non-fans may want to watch the first two seasons to fully get the scope of the series despite the featurette included, though.",5,The best Inuyasha movie yet!,1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,1624,"['second', 'movie', 'definitely', 'provided', 'bit', 'change', 'pace', 'showing', 'how', 'heroes', 'would', 'go', 'ever', 'defeated', 'Naraku', 'one', 'definitely', 'usual', 'formula', 'Starting', 'flashback', 'night', 'Inuyasha', 'was', 'born', 'offering', 'bit', 'past', 'father', 'go', 'present', 'day', 'series', 'deadly', 'sword', 'called', 'Sounga', 'awakened', 'destruction', 'destroying', 'Kagome', 'hometown', 'then', 'Inuyasha', 'evil', 'destruction', 'spree', 'Feudal', 'Era', 'double', 'Eventually', 'sword', 'new', 'host', 'Takemaru', 'deceased', 'lord', 'who', 'hated', 'Inuyasha', 'Sesshomaru', 'father', 'nice', 'touch', 'continuity', 'wield', 'sword', 'giving', 'Sesshomaru', 'decapitated', 'arm', 'brothers', 'want', 'destroy', 'sword', 'own', 'only', 'possible', 'way', 'work', 'together', 'Can', 'Inuyasha', 'Sesshomaru', 'usual', 'gang', 'as', 'well', 'Totosai', 'believe', 'not', 'actually', 'defeat', 'deadliest', 'threat', 'yet', 'story', 'good', 'entire', 'film', 'well', 'animated', 'especially', 'battle', 'scenes', 'usual', 'voice', 'cast', 'versions', 'also', 'great', 'usual', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'did', 'series', 'featurette', 'told', 'entirely', 'Japanese', 'importants', 'events', 'lead', 'up', 'film', 'also', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'as', 'well', 'one', '4th', 'film', 'watch', 'long', 'enough', 'Inuyasha', 'fans', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'non-fans', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'fully', 'get', 'scope', 'series', 'featurette', 'included']","InuYasha, The Movie 3 - Swords of an Honorable Ruler"

I have got to say that this is by far one of the greatest movies of my collection. It starts off with Inuyasha's father talking to sesshomaru and after that things begin to heat up. It turns out that Inuyasha was to be born on that same night and his father was just wounded from battle. WIth that in mind he is still determined to go and protect his wife and son. Upon his arrival there seems to be guards preventing the great dog demon from entering so there was only one solution which was to move or die. We get to see his father use all three of his awesome swords and how each of them play an important role. Tenseiga the sword of heaven weilded by sesshomaru has to power to save 100 lives, Tetsaiga the sword of earth has the power to slay 100 enemies with a single swing, and the sounga the sword of hell which can summon 100 corpses from the gates of hell.

I have yet to see the fourth movie, but of the first 3, this is my favorite and it will be tough to beat.  The third movie focuses on Inuyasha and Sesshomaru's relationship, or lack there of, with their father and his swords which he handed down to them.This movie explains how Inuyasha's father met his end and reveals a secret.  Inuyasha's father had 3 swords.  He gave the sword of heaven which can save 100 lives with one swing to his older son, Sesshomaru.  This sword is called the Tenseiga.  He gave the sword of earth which can be used to vanquish 100 foes in one swing and in  doing so defend mankind to his younger son, Inuyasha.  This sword is called Tetsusaiga. His last sword was the sword of hell and was capable of plunging the entire earth into hell.  This sword was called the Sounga.Inuyasha's father banished the sword Sounga after his death, but in Kagome's time the sword was released from its seal.  Now Inuyasha and Sesshomaru must stop the rampaging Sounga before it carries out its mission and destroys all mankind.  Only by using both the Backlash Wave, Tetsusaiga's Ultimate technique and the Dragon Strike, Sesshomaru's technique which he can use with the Tenseiga together can the Sounga be destroyed, but can these two siblings work together long enough to discover victory?This movie is wonderful in that it explains much of Sesshomaru's past and why he does the things he does.  Sesshomaru's development in this movie is wonderful and all the other characters are not to be missed.

During the course of the film, Inuyasha and his brother, Sesshomaru (who hate each other), must team up together in order to defeat the enemy.  But can these feuding brothers put aside their rivalry long enough to save the day?There are seven special features on the DVD.  The first is a Line Art Gallery, which is split into two sections: Characters and Settings.  There are forty pages of character model sheets under the ""Characters"" section.  The ""Settings"" section contains thirty-two pages of settings.The ""Special Footage"" link is next, and it takes you to a feature that runs a little over twenty-six minutes.  This footage recaps some of the important moments in the series that tie in to Inuyasha and Sesshomaru's rivalry.Next, there are the Japanese trailers for Swords of an Honorable Ruler, with a trailer for the fourth Inuyasha film included at the end.  These run for about five minutes, but they are all in Japanese with no English subtitles.  There are also Viz Media trailers, a one screen ad for the Inuyasha graphic novels, a one screen ad for the Inuyasha trading card game, and a preview for the Inuyasha Feudal Combat video game (which looks a lot like Inuyasha characters are put into a game that is played in the same manner as the Street Fighter games).Overall, Swords of an Honorable Ruler is an excellent film.

This one has Inuyasha and Sesshomaru fight each other at least until a villion name Sounga steps which is a much bigger picture. September 6 is way too long for this movie to come out.This movie has more blood then the first two movies it makes them look like disney movies. Kikyo is not in this movie at all. A new character named Siya who protected the evil sword for 200 years instead of 700.The drawings and the animation looks so mature like real anime manga.,5,I Grade this an A+,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,508,"['Finally', 'Amazon', 'list', '3rd', 'Inuyasha', 'movie', 'one', 'Inuyasha', 'Sesshomaru', 'fight', 'other', 'least', 'villion', 'name', 'Sounga', 'steps', 'much', 'bigger', 'picture', 'September', '6', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'movie', 'come', 'out.This', 'movie', 'more', 'blood', 'then', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'look', 'disney', 'movies', 'Kikyo', 'not', 'movie', 'new', 'character', 'named', 'Siya', 'who', 'protected', 'evil', 'sword', '200', 'years', 'instead', '700.The', 'drawings', 'animation', 'so', 'mature', 'real', 'anime', 'manga']","InuYasha, The Movie 3 - Swords of an Honorable Ruler"

It was put under seal by a guardian demon and thrown into the same well that Kagome uses to time travel back to the feudal age. But after 700 years the seal has worn away and the sword seeks out the most powerful demon in the vicinity, which just happens to be Inuyasha who was visiting Kagome in the present. Since he is only a half-demon, he does not have the power to wield the sentient sword, which gains partial control of his actions. Inuyasha is able to make it back to his time, but cannot keep the sword from making him attack his friends. He's at a loss as to how to free himself from the sword but Sesshomaru has an idea! He'll take it from his dead hand! You see, Sesshomaru is pretty jealous of anything that Inuyasha possesses of their father's because he sees himself as his true son. Inuyasha is just a mistake of his dad's weakness.Sesshomaru is one of my favorite characters on the Inuyasha tv show, so it was nice to see him play a bigger role in this movie. I thought a cool thing about this movie is that we finally get to see something about the lives of Inuyasha's parents. We already knew about his mother as she gave him unconditional love even though humans were afraid of him as a child. But we also finally get a look at his father, who seems to have the best traits of his two sons. But while the flashbacks to the origins of Inuyasha's birth was welcome, in other respects this movie seemed like an extended tv episode that went on too long and dragged a bit. We've seen the Inuyasha controlled by his demon blood plot before so it gets old fast. It's worth seeing for any Inuyasha fan for the fill-ins of the past and for Sesshomaru's epiphany of where strength comes from.",3,THE THIRD SWORD,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,1897,"['addition', 'possessing', 'two', 'swords', 'Tetsusaiga', 'Tenseiga', 'now', 'belong', 'Inuyasha', 'Sesshomaru', 'father', 'also', 'possessed', 'demon', 'possessed', 'sword', 'great', 'power', 'called', 'Sounga', 'was', 'put', 'seal', 'guardian', 'demon', 'thrown', 'same', 'well', 'Kagome', 'time', 'travel', 'back', 'feudal', 'age', '700', 'years', 'seal', 'worn', 'away', 'sword', 'out', 'most', 'powerful', 'demon', 'vicinity', 'just', 'be', 'Inuyasha', 'who', 'was', 'visiting', 'Kagome', 'present', 'only', 'half-demon', 'not', 'have', 'power', 'wield', 'sentient', 'sword', 'gains', 'partial', 'control', 'actions', 'Inuyasha', 'able', 'make', 'back', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'sword', 'making', 'attack', 'friends', 'loss', 'how', 'free', 'sword', 'Sesshomaru', 'idea', ""'ll"", 'take', 'dead', 'hand', 'see', 'Sesshomaru', 'pretty', 'jealous', 'anything', 'Inuyasha', 'possesses', 'father', 'true', 'son', 'Inuyasha', 'just', 'mistake', 'dad', 'weakness.Sesshomaru', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Inuyasha', 'tv', 'show', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'play', 'bigger', 'role', 'movie', 'thought', 'cool', 'thing', 'movie', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'something', 'lives', 'Inuyasha', 'parents', 'already', 'knew', 'mother', 'gave', 'unconditional', 'love', 'even', 'humans', 'were', 'afraid', 'child', 'also', 'finally', 'get', 'look', 'father', 'who', 'have', 'best', 'traits', 'two', 'sons', 'flashbacks', 'origins', 'Inuyasha', 'birth', 'was', 'welcome', 'other', 'respects', 'movie', 'seemed', 'extended', 'tv', 'episode', 'went', 'too', 'long', 'dragged', 'bit', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Inuyasha', 'controlled', 'demon', 'blood', 'plot', 'old', 'fast', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Inuyasha', 'fan', 'fill-ins', 'past', 'Sesshomaru', 'epiphany', 'where', 'strength']","InuYasha, The Movie 3 - Swords of an Honorable Ruler"
