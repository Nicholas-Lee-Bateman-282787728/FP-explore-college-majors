I first read about Hansen in a John Douglas book (frankly, I can't remember if it was in MindHunter or Journey Into Darkness, but it was one of them), and had always thought of Paulson as the real hero of the story.  After all, this girl managed to get away from a serial killer who'd dispatched MANY MANY victims before her.  If there's any name you should remember, it should be that of Cindy Paulson.  After being kidnapped, raped, and truly would have been dead if she didn't run half naked down an Alaska road until someone picked her up and took her to the police station.  I always thought it a travesty she wasn't believed and was treated like dirt by the local police, and as the story shows, only after someone really looked into things did they realize the disgrace and injustice of the local legal system at the time.Again, as someone whose known this story for 2 decades, I was a little suspicious I hadn't heard of the film, especially when it brings A listers like Cusack and Cage to it.  As others have stated, I'm thrilled they didn't glorify the killer, or turn it into a slasher flick, but rather told us Paulson's side of the story, with the truth of what happened to so many other women at the hands of a monster.  I watched it because I knew the back story... One thing they left out was one of the witnesses who said Hansen had been at his house playing cards the night of Paulson's rape later came forward and admitted he'd been asked by Hansen to lie, though Hansen had lied to the guy about with what crime he'd been a suspect, and I think that would have helped others KNOW they had the right guy.  I thought they left a small bit of doubt in the actual police case against Hansen, when in truth they had him dead to rights.Anyway, despite watching it because I felt I knew the story, I actually found myself caught up in the film which is true testimony to the job done by the writers, actors, director, and producers.

1662773,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00DZP1BZ0,California Dreaming,"[3, 6]","I've read a book about this case -- ""Hunted on Ice"" -- a book that I didn't recommend, and left a review on this site as to why.  I also have seen a couple of documentaries as well, documentaries that made me initially interested in this case.  So I was really interested in seeing this film, particularly since John Cusack is one of the stars, and I've always been a big fan of his.  As I always say, if you disagree with me, just check out ""High Fidelity"" or ""Grosse Pointe Blank.""But suffice it to say, after just watching today on pay-per-view, I am fairly disappointed in the final product.  In my opinion, they spent way too much film footage (or make that digital storage nowadays) in strip bars here (some people may say that as a plus, I suppose), and too much time dealing with the Cindy Paulson character.  Yes, she was an instrumental witness that ultimately helped convict Robert Hansen, as she was one of the only women he intended to kill who didn't die by his hands.  Or make that more by his gun.  I just don't feel that I really got to know or understand the Hansen character here much because the time that she spent on the screen was time lost for Mr. Cusack.But still, if I were to stack rank the acting performances in this film, I would rank them as follows (best to worst):  Vanessa Hudgens, Nicholas Cage, and then finally Mr. Cusack.  But I'm not exactly sure that this was Mr. Cusack's fault; I'm not convinced that the screenplay gave him enough time on screen.  But at the same time, I think that he may have been slightly miscast as well; in reality, I believe that his talents were wasted on this surprisingly minimalist role.  And Mr. Hansen has a stutter in real life, and I think that that's always difficult for most actors to pull off on screen.But perhaps the biggest disappointment for me:  I believe that they changed quite a bit of the true story for dramatic effect.  During the real search of the house, from what I remember, they found quite a few actual trophies from the victims.  Here, they seemed to allude that he buried them remotely under a fallen tree.  And there is a scene that shows the Hansen character paying someone to ""off"" Ms. Paulson.  Now, I can't believe that Mr. Hansen would ever pay anyone to kill anyone for him; he seemed to be pretty good at it himself.  And there is a subsequent scene where Ms. Hudgens almost dies by this paid assassin's hands and gets away.  (I may be wrong, but I don't think that any of this happened in the real case, from what I've read and seen.)I've always said, ""When you've got a good story, just tell it.""  And I think that this unfortunately happened to a film that should have been incredibly riveting.

1662790,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B00DZP1BZ0,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[0, 0]","If I never see another ""serial killer"" film again, that will be too soon. Monsters of our modern age as opposed to -- I don't know -- Martians from the 1950s (Invaders from Mars) and Satanic cults from the 1960s (Rosemary's Baby), their obsessively documented exploits have eroded my faith in culture, if not humankind. Thanks to the Wonderful World of Internet, we can now read (and sometimes view) every detail of their heinous outbreaks, almost always perpetrated against women. Since the classicThe Silence of the Lambsexploded across movie marquees in 1990, serial killers have become primetime fare sandwiched between beer commercials. We've been desensitized, or as Francois Truffaut once said, ""It's impossible to make anti-war films because their energy and destruction make war look fun.""With that said, the 2013 film ""The Frozen Ground"" is surprisingly good. Writer and director Scott Walker has crafted a thoughtful examination of the sad crimes of Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen (Fair Game). An expert hunter with all the menacing presence of Uncle Rico, Hansen would kidnap women - usually prostitutes - release them into the wild and track them down. He murdered roughly 20 women before his arrest in the 1980s. Where ""The Frozen Ground"" succeeds is its unflinching look at Cindy Paulson, a victim who escaped the clutches of Hansen and told her story to disinterested authorities.In one of the great performances of the year, Vanessa Hudgens portrays Paulson as a haunted, street-wise loser. She's a runaway, scrapping a survivor's living as a part-time prostitute and full-time drug addict. She represents the high-risk lifestyle that serves as fodder for so many Hansen-like monsters. That she is turned into a sympathetic human being, undeserving of the cruelty dumped upon her by a variety of pimps and dealers, is one of the film's unexpected accomplishments. These female lost souls can be found in every city, chain smoking and fidgety, unjustly destined for ugly ends.""The Frozen Ground"" has a better-than-deserved cast, including Nicolas Cage as local investigator Jack Halcombe and John Cusack as Hansen. Both actors, perhaps past their prime, having soared for decades with a variety of career peaks, serve up earnest portrayals. Cage's unorthodox intensity works well as he doggedly examines each crime scene, leading to the obligatory shot of him standing before victim photographs and stating, ""What am I missing?!"" After Hudgens's Paulson leaves the police station and disappears into the seedy side of Anchorage, Cage realizes she may be the key to cracking the case.These scenes are paralleled by Cusack's Hansen stalking another victim, including uncomfortable detail of his modus operandi. In reality, Hansen played it straight after Paulson's escape (she actually served as a technical adviser on this film), though the walls crumbled when police searched his home. Part of the suspense of ""The Frozen Ground"" hinges on authorities being unable to obtain a search warrant due to Hansen's positive reputation in the community, including having a wife and kids and being the proprietor of a popular bakery.Where ""The Frozen Ground"" also succeeds is its extraordinary on-location filming in Alaska. There is no doubt this film was entirely made within the state, with snow-covered streets and gray slush covering every frame. Skies are overcast, actor's faces are a variety shades of maroon and breath plumes from their shivering mouths. When Cage's Halcombe enters several strip clubs in search of Paulson, it's apparent these locales are real, with extras as authentic as a documentary.As the film ends, each Hansen victim is shown, an extended segment as we see photographs of numerous women, their names and the year they disappeared. It's a startling touch making us realize the overwhelming horror of this true story. Walker's film maintains emotional honesty by not only giving the victims faces, but in attempting to detail through Paulson the daily grind of outcast women living difficult lives. Authentic and gritty, ""The Frozen Ground"" is less about Hansen than the kind of women stalked by more than one monster within our society.",4,Fodder for Monsters...,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,4181,"['never', 'see', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'soon', 'Monsters', 'modern', 'age', 'opposed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Martians', '1950s', 'Invaders', 'Mars', 'Satanic', 'cults', '1960s', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'obsessively', 'documented', 'exploits', 'have', 'eroded', 'faith', 'culture', 'not', 'humankind', 'Thanks', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Internet', 'can', 'now', 'read', 'sometimes', 'view', 'detail', 'heinous', 'outbreaks', 'almost', 'always', 'perpetrated', 'women', 'classicThe', 'Silence', 'Lambsexploded', 'movie', 'marquees', '1990', 'serial', 'killers', 'have', 'become', 'primetime', 'fare', 'sandwiched', 'beer', 'commercials', ""'ve"", 'been', 'desensitized', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'once', 'said', 'impossible', 'make', 'anti-war', 'films', 'energy', 'destruction', 'make', 'war', 'look', 'fun', 'said', '2013', 'film', 'Frozen', 'Ground', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Writer', 'director', 'Scott', 'Walker', 'crafted', 'thoughtful', 'examination', 'sad', 'crimes', 'Alaskan', 'serial', 'killer', 'Robert', 'Hansen', 'Fair', 'Game', 'expert', 'hunter', 'menacing', 'presence', 'Uncle', 'Rico', 'Hansen', 'would', 'kidnap', 'women', 'usually', 'release', 'wild', 'track', 'down', 'murdered', 'roughly', '20', 'women', 'arrest', '1980s', 'Where', 'Frozen', 'Ground', 'unflinching', 'look', 'Cindy', 'Paulson', 'victim', 'who', 'escaped', 'clutches', 'Hansen', 'told', 'story', 'disinterested', 'one', 'great', 'performances', 'year', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'Paulson', 'haunted', 'street-wise', 'loser', 'runaway', 'scrapping', 'survivor', 'living', 'part-time', 'prostitute', 'full-time', 'drug', 'addict', 'high-risk', 'lifestyle', 'fodder', 'so', 'many', 'Hansen-like', 'monsters', 'turned', 'sympathetic', 'human', 'being', 'undeserving', 'cruelty', 'dumped', 'variety', 'pimps', 'dealers', 'one', 'film', 'unexpected', 'accomplishments', 'female', 'lost', 'souls', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'city', 'chain', 'smoking', 'fidgety', 'unjustly', 'destined', 'ugly', 'Frozen', 'Ground', 'better-than-deserved', 'cast', 'including', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'local', 'investigator', 'Jack', 'Halcombe', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Hansen', 'actors', 'perhaps', 'prime', 'having', 'soared', 'decades', 'variety', 'career', 'peaks', 'serve', 'up', 'earnest', 'portrayals', 'Cage', 'unorthodox', 'intensity', 'well', 'doggedly', 'crime', 'scene', 'leading', 'obligatory', 'shot', 'standing', 'victim', 'photographs', 'stating', 'What', 'am', 'missing', 'Hudgens', 'Paulson', 'police', 'station', 'seedy', 'side', 'Anchorage', 'Cage', 'may', 'be', 'key', 'cracking', 'case.These', 'scenes', 'are', 'paralleled', 'Cusack', 'Hansen', 'stalking', 'victim', 'including', 'uncomfortable', 'detail', 'modus', 'operandi', 'reality', 'Hansen', 'played', 'straight', 'Paulson', 'escape', 'actually', 'served', 'technical', 'adviser', 'film', 'walls', 'crumbled', 'when', 'police', 'searched', 'home', 'Part', 'suspense', 'Frozen', 'Ground', 'authorities', 'being', 'unable', 'obtain', 'search', 'warrant', 'due', 'Hansen', 'positive', 'reputation', 'community', 'including', 'having', 'wife', 'kids', 'being', 'proprietor', 'popular', 'bakery.Where', 'Frozen', 'Ground', 'also', 'extraordinary', 'on-location', 'filming', 'Alaska', 'doubt', 'film', 'was', 'entirely', 'made', 'state', 'snow-covered', 'streets', 'gray', 'slush', 'covering', 'frame', 'Skies', 'are', 'overcast', 'actor', 'are', 'variety', 'shades', 'maroon', 'breath', 'plumes', 'shivering', 'mouths', 'When', 'Cage', 'Halcombe', 'several', 'strip', 'clubs', 'search', 'Paulson', 'apparent', 'locales', 'are', 'real', 'extras', 'as', 'authentic', 'documentary.As', 'film', 'Hansen', 'victim', 'shown', 'extended', 'segment', 'see', 'photographs', 'numerous', 'women', 'names', 'year', 'disappeared', 'startling', 'touch', 'making', 'realize', 'overwhelming', 'horror', 'true', 'story', 'Walker', 'film', 'emotional', 'honesty', 'not', 'only', 'giving', 'victims', 'attempting', 'detail', 'Paulson', 'daily', 'grind', 'outcast', 'women', 'living', 'difficult', 'lives', 'Authentic', 'gritty', 'Frozen', 'Ground', 'less', 'Hansen', 'kind', 'women', 'stalked', 'more', 'one', 'monster', 'society']",N/A

However this movie was a nice lil surprise and I highly recommend it, especially if you like this genre.  Both actors were outstanding in the movie, John Cusack as criminal and Nicholas Cage as the cop. The story is about Cusack and his shady past but rehabiltated image as a well liked man in the local donut/bakery/coffee shop family man who is hiding a dark secret.  Cage is a Detective who is 2 weeks away from a transfer and gets assigned the typical homicide case that turns out to be more than a mouthful.  Cage's intensity helped a lot and you could feel it in his performance.  Cusack, who I had never seen in this sort of role was great as you could see and feel the pressure and tension mounting on both characters.  In the middle is a young female victim who is a witness who wasn't taken seriously by investigators bc of her social class and character, she's a teen prostitute runaway.This is a movie based on real events which also always adds a bit of authenticity for me but there were those moments that just weren't fleshed out that great.  I'm a stickler for detail and this was missing attention to it at times and the story of Cusack could have been developed a bit more considering the historical perspective we have on his character.  We just sort of jump right in and take off running which isn't always bad but there was a fair amount of material to draw from and seemed like a missed opportunity.  Overall though it was really good, 50 cent cast as a pimp with long-braided hair was pretty funny. Not a good personal look for him and I'm also not a fan of him in movies at all, he has a descent amount of screen time and thought that could have been better served by an actor  instead of a hip-pop star.",4,3.5 Stars and better than I expected,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,1869,"['movie', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'two', 'thought', 'finished', 'product', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'ideal', 'straight', 'DVD', 'romp', 'However', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'lil', 'surprise', 'highly', 'recommend', 'especially', 'like', 'genre', 'actors', 'were', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'John', 'Cusack', 'criminal', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'cop', 'story', 'Cusack', 'shady', 'past', 'rehabiltated', 'image', 'well', 'liked', 'man', 'local', 'donut/bakery/coffee', 'shop', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'hiding', 'dark', 'secret', 'Cage', 'Detective', 'who', '2', 'weeks', 'away', 'transfer', 'assigned', 'typical', 'homicide', 'case', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'mouthful', 'Cage', 'intensity', 'helped', 'lot', 'could', 'feel', 'performance', 'Cusack', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'sort', 'role', 'was', 'great', 'could', 'see', 'feel', 'pressure', 'tension', 'mounting', 'characters', 'middle', 'young', 'female', 'victim', 'who', 'witness', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'taken', 'seriously', 'investigators', 'bc', 'social', 'class', 'character', 'teen', 'prostitute', 'runaway.This', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'also', 'always', 'bit', 'authenticity', 'were', 'moments', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'great', ""'m"", 'stickler', 'detail', 'was', 'missing', 'attention', 'times', 'story', 'Cusack', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'bit', 'more', 'considering', 'historical', 'perspective', 'have', 'character', 'just', 'sort', 'jump', 'right', 'take', 'off', 'running', ""n't"", 'always', 'bad', 'was', 'fair', 'amount', 'material', 'draw', 'seemed', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'was', 'really', 'good', '50', 'cent', 'cast', 'pimp', 'long-braided', 'hair', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Not', 'good', 'personal', 'look', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'fan', 'movies', 'descent', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'actor', 'instead', 'hip-pop', 'star']",N/A

1662834,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00DZP1BZ0,Doug Park,"[1, 1]","THE FROZEN GROUND does a straightforwardly fine job of telling the story of 1980s Alaska serial killer Robert Hansen. It's easily the best based-upon-fact murder film to come along in some time. The keen use of settings brings about that crucial realism. Cusack and Cage both give impressive performances as Hansen himself and Alaska State Detective Jack Halcombe, a rather uncoppish cop (typical role for Cage). Vanessa Hudgens is spectacular as would-be victim Cindy Paulson; many of the other supporting cast also give excellent performances, particularly Curtis ""50-Cent"" Jackson as Paulson's sometime-pimp. THE FROZEN GROUND relates the police investigation with all its little holes, inconsistencies, and disagreements most convincingly. The film also gives a realistic--I assume, never having personally been there, of course--portrayal of the Anchorage underworld and red light district. Some gore and partial nudity: THE FROZEN GROUND is tasteful as possible without pulling any punches. Last but far from least, some of the small, apparently insignificant details--e.g., the moose in the alleyway--add oh-so-much in the way of subtle mood and symbolism.This may have been hard to avoid, but it might worked better if the killer's identity was not made clear so early in the film and if more of the other  suspects had been brought into the picture. That way, there would have been some element of surprise for those not already familiar with this case, which isn't all that well-known. A bit more on Hansen's sickly unique M.O. might also have helped distinguish THE FROZEN GROUND. Finally, I wanted to see more on how exactly Paulson managed to escape Hansen, as well as why he managed to avoid arrest immediately after she did.",4,Very Good Docu-Drama,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1739,"['FROZEN', 'GROUND', 'straightforwardly', 'fine', 'job', 'telling', 'story', '1980s', 'Alaska', 'serial', 'killer', 'Robert', 'Hansen', 'easily', 'best', 'based-upon-fact', 'murder', 'film', 'come', 'along', 'time', 'keen', 'use', 'settings', 'brings', 'crucial', 'realism', 'Cusack', 'Cage', 'give', 'impressive', 'performances', 'Hansen', 'Alaska', 'State', 'Detective', 'Jack', 'Halcombe', 'rather', 'uncoppish', 'cop', 'typical', 'role', 'Cage', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'spectacular', 'would-be', 'victim', 'Cindy', 'Paulson', 'many', 'other', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Curtis', '50-Cent', 'Jackson', 'Paulson', 'sometime-pimp', 'FROZEN', 'GROUND', 'police', 'investigation', 'little', 'holes', 'inconsistencies', 'disagreements', 'most', 'convincingly', 'film', 'also', 'realistic', 'assume', 'never', 'having', 'personally', 'been', 'there', 'course', 'portrayal', 'Anchorage', 'underworld', 'red', 'light', 'district', 'gore', 'partial', 'nudity', 'FROZEN', 'GROUND', 'tasteful', 'possible', 'pulling', 'punches', 'Last', 'far', 'least', 'small', 'apparently', 'insignificant', 'details', 'e.g.', 'moose', 'alleyway', 'add', 'oh-so-much', 'way', 'subtle', 'mood', 'symbolism.This', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'avoid', 'might', 'worked', 'better', 'killer', 'identity', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'so', 'early', 'film', 'more', 'other', 'suspects', 'had', 'been', 'brought', 'picture', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'element', 'surprise', 'not', 'already', 'familiar', 'case', ""n't"", 'well-known', 'bit', 'more', 'Hansen', 'sickly', 'unique', 'M.O', 'might', 'also', 'have', 'helped', 'distinguish', 'FROZEN', 'GROUND', 'Finally', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'how', 'exactly', 'Paulson', 'managed', 'escape', 'Hansen', 'as', 'well', 'why', 'managed', 'avoid', 'arrest', 'immediately', 'did']",N/A

Half an hour from Anchorage in any direction puts the visitor in the middle of the some of the most beautiful wild country left in North America.  Anchorage itself is pretty enough in summer.  In winter, however, the visitors leave, and Anchorage folds back in on itself, to hunker down and wait out the long cold dark.  Once upon a time, it was a happy hunting ground for a serial killer...""The Frozen Ground"" is the dramatization of the investigation into serial killer Robert Hansen of Anchorage, still known as ""butcher baker"" among local law enforcement.  Nicholas Cage plays stalwart Alaska State Trooper Jack Halcombe, who leads the investigation, assisted by Vanessa Hudgens as the young prostitute Cindy, one of Hansen's would-be victims who managed to escape.  John Cusack is chilling as the seemingly unremarkable Hansen, a baker, husband and father with a vicious hobby.  The movie includes a prolonged dive into the gritty underbelly of Anchorage, with its bars, prostitution, drug use, and violence, where a clever killer could hang out for years without even being noticed.The viewer knows early the identity of the killer; the drama of the movie is in the struggle to find the evidence to arrest Hansen before he can kill again.  At the end, Halcombe and his law enforcement partners will be pushed into a tough corner, racing the clock to get Hansen before he can get rid of the evidence and the principal witness.  The movie benefits from its location shooting in and around Anchorage, including the Knik River, the Chugach Mountains, and the Matanuska Glacier.  The dark and the cold help shape the atmospherics of a tense thriller, told almost in documentary style.

1662850,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00DZP1BZ0,FNDNreview,"[9, 10]","Let me first begin by saying that I am not a fan of Nicolas Cage, and there's maybe only one of two films that he's been a part of that I've actually enjoyed.  This doesn't mean I have some sort of vendetta against the man or his work - other than his style of acting not being my cup of tea.  For a man that was (at one point) on the verge of playing Superman, Cage sure has taken lead roles in some completely lackluster films - including Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, Drive Angry, and Stolen (with several more on top of those).  With that being said, the fact that it's been quite a while since Cage has been relevant has not bothered me in the slightest.  Truth be told, Cage will have to work extra hard to get back into Hollywood's spotlight, assuming he ever wants to be there.  In any event, he appears to be on the right track, starring in the new drama, The Frozen Ground.Scott Walker makes his writing and directorial debut with The Frozen Ground, starring Nicolas Cage as Jack Halcombe - an Alaskan police sergeant that is assigned a case to bring a serial killer to justice.  For more than 15 years, Robert Hansen (John Cusack) has blended in with the community as an upstanding, respectable citizen - while secretly abducting, raping, and murdering young teenage girls.  His latest victim, a prostitute named Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens), is able to escape Hansen's clutches, but when she tells her story to the police, they don't believe her.  When Paulson's story is brought to Sgt. Halcombe's attention, he takes it upon himself to protect her while searching for enough evidence to put Hansen behind bars.  Curtis Jackson, Dean Norris, and Radha Mitchell also star in supporting roles.Surprisingly, Nicolas Cage is on the top of his game in the role of Sgt. Halcombe.  When we first meet Halcombe, he's preparing to exit his job and start a new chapter in his life.  However, things change when he's put in charge of a series of murders that all resemble the same pattern:  the murder of young girls.  While Cage portrays the generic law enforcement lead - driven, ambitious, and won't settle for failure - he still manages to bring a realistic emotion to a character that rarely displays physical emotion.  This lead character, haunted by the death of his sister from an automobile accident, doesn't let death define him, yet this tragic incident provides another dimension to an otherwise predictable character.  All in all, this is probably Cage's most impressive role since World Trade Center.While I'm mostly on the wrong side of the fence when it comes to Nicolas Cage, I would certainly call myself a fan of Cage's fellow co-star, John Cusack.  The careers of Cage and Cusack sort of mirror each other in terms of their popularity and status in the limelight.  Neither would be considered major stars, but both have a loyal following.  Both Cage and Cusack, previously collaborating on the 1997 summer blockbuster, Con Air, are back together and mesh together rather well in their reunion.  Cusack isn't exactly the most calculating villain in this flick, but he does an admirable jump - easily comparable to Robin Williams's villainous character in Insomnia.  From the very beginning, viewers are aware of who the bad guy is, and will go through the dramatic motions of various interactions in which the villain escapes being caught.  Unfortunately, Cusack's interaction with Cage is minimal and doesn't even occur until nearly three quarters of the way through the film - but the build-up is still worth the wait.I'm on record of being against musicians taking their ""talents"" to acting, especially when it comes to singers like Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, and Selena Gomez.  More often than not, their appearance in a film alone is enough to warrant a terrible review for a film.  However, in the case of Vanessa Hudgens - she has managed to work her way around joining the club of pre-mentioned singers turned ""actresses.""  Hudgens certainly stands out in that particular crowd, showing signs of potential in previous roles, like Spring Breakers and Sucker Punch (I said signs of potential).  She also shows signs of potential in various scenes in The Frozen Ground, mostly when she's drugged out or weeping in a police station - but the potential is there.  Surprisingly, she is given quite a bit of screen time, and doesn't completely bomb with it.  It's quite possible her future might be in film after all.  It might be low-budget, straight-to-video film, but that's film none-the-less.More often than not, The Frozen Ground features an attention-sustaining pace - even though you can quickly predict the film's inevitable outcome.  The fact that this film is a true story, based on the murders committed by Robert Hansen between 1971 and 1983, at least provides a bit of history to go along with a foreseeable outcome.  There are shades of Christopher Nolan's Insomnia sprinkled all over this film, mostly since you'll be able to see the lives of two men taking different paths that will eventually intersect with one another.  The characters are written well, given average back stories, but really lack a big name presence that would have given this film much more attention than it did.  Like many flicks that only briefly land in theaters, The Frozen Ground went to on-demand and quickly to home video.  Was it worth a trip to the theater?

1662851,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B00DZP1BZ0,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[0, 0]","The Frozen Ground is based on the true story of serial killer Robert Hansen, who terrorized Alaska during  80s, during which time there were many reports of missing women as well as mysterious deaths in  Alaskan wilderness. In the film, a state trooper (Nicholas Cage) comes to believe that the string of deaths and missing person reports all come from one source, a respectable member of the community. Cindy Paulson, a teenager who had managed to escape Hansen, becomes a key witness in this case.What I liked about The Frozen Ground is that, while the film does have elements of a crime thriller we've seen before, it has solid acting from several of the leads that make it go beyond an average thriller. Cage does an exceptional job of handling this role with a scaled-down, subtle realness. He tries to bring this cold-case back to life, and pin down enough evidence on the suspect to get a case. As real life Jack Halcombe, he tries to help Cindy get over the emotional trauma of her horrifying encounter all the while trying to track a madman. John Cusack plays the creepy role of Hansen to perfection. Vanessa Hudgens gives a stellar performance as Cindy.I saw an interview with Nicolas Cage where he was talking about this film and preparing for the role. In it, he was discussing how he met with the real-life detective who was responsible for bringing Hansen to justice, and considered him a hero for his efforts. He got much of the background for this story and a feel for the person he was portraying. This is quite evident in the film. A really good performance.This film, as expected, does have some disturbing content based on its subject. We are taken through the world of strip clubs and prostitution and the seedy parts of the community. There are also moments of violence that are disturbing.  I think these moments, though, give a stark realness to the setting and events that took place.A powerful thriller. One to definitely check out.",4,Cage does a superb job here,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,1958,"['Frozen', 'Ground', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'Robert', 'Hansen', 'who', 'terrorized', 'Alaska', '80s', 'time', 'were', 'many', 'reports', 'missing', 'women', 'as', 'well', 'mysterious', 'deaths', 'Alaskan', 'wilderness', 'film', 'state', 'trooper', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'believe', 'string', 'deaths', 'missing', 'person', 'reports', 'come', 'one', 'source', 'respectable', 'member', 'community', 'Cindy', 'Paulson', 'teenager', 'who', 'had', 'managed', 'escape', 'Hansen', 'key', 'witness', 'case.What', 'liked', 'Frozen', 'Ground', 'film', 'have', 'elements', 'crime', 'thriller', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'solid', 'acting', 'several', 'leads', 'make', 'go', 'average', 'thriller', 'Cage', 'exceptional', 'job', 'handling', 'role', 'scaled-down', 'subtle', 'realness', 'bring', 'cold-case', 'back', 'life', 'pin', 'down', 'enough', 'evidence', 'suspect', 'get', 'case', 'real', 'life', 'Jack', 'Halcombe', 'help', 'Cindy', 'get', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'horrifying', 'encounter', 'while', 'trying', 'track', 'madman', 'John', 'Cusack', 'creepy', 'role', 'Hansen', 'perfection', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Cindy.I', 'saw', 'interview', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'where', 'was', 'talking', 'film', 'preparing', 'role', 'was', 'discussing', 'how', 'met', 'real-life', 'detective', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'Hansen', 'justice', 'considered', 'hero', 'efforts', 'got', 'much', 'background', 'story', 'feel', 'person', 'was', 'portraying', 'quite', 'evident', 'film', 'A', 'really', 'good', 'performance.This', 'film', 'expected', 'have', 'disturbing', 'content', 'based', 'subject', 'are', 'taken', 'world', 'strip', 'clubs', 'prostitution', 'seedy', 'parts', 'community', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'violence', 'are', 'disturbing', 'think', 'moments', 'though', 'give', 'stark', 'realness', 'setting', 'events', 'took', 'place.A', 'powerful', 'thriller', 'One', 'definitely', 'check', 'out']",N/A

Nicholas Cage is intense as Alaska State Trooper homicide detective Jack Halcombe - based on real-life detective Glenn Flothe - determined to capture psycho killer Hansen, who is brilliantly portrayed by John Cusack: very low-key and good-natured on the surface, but displaying a cold, frightening brutality towards the women he sexually assaulted and murdered.  Hansen led a double life, a real Jekyll and Hyde: on the surface, he was the successful owner of a bakery, very quiet, very religious, a married man with two children.  His inner, dark world seethed with perverted, evil, and murderous misogyny, bubbling and oozing to the surface as he preyed on young women in the seamy, tough areas of Anchorage; many - although not all - of his victims were prostitutes and strippers. An avid hunter, he tracked and killed these young women just as he did the animals whose heads were nailed to the walls of his home.

Lets talk about The Frozen Ground.In the movie, Cindy Paulson is found in a horrific condition by officers and later questioned by Sergeant Jack Halcombe. Upon learning the details of what has happened to her, Jack and Cindy must work to take down our antagonist Robert Hansen. And so our movie begins.Like normal, I start with the acting. I must say I was impressed with everyone's acting in the film; especially Vanessa Hudgens's and Joan Cusack's performances. Also great in his role as the lead Officer Jack Halcombe, Nicholas Cage who encompasses the character with resolve and skill.It is not always the easiest film to watch, but The Frozen Ground is a solid movie for the movie viewer.

Halcombe sets out to end the murderous rampage of Robert Hansen, a serial killer who has silently stalked the streets of Anchorage for more than 13 years. As the bodies of Anchorage women start to add up, Sgt. Halcombe goes on a personal manhunt to find the killer. When 17-year-old Cindy Paulson escapes Hansen's unspeakable violence, she believes the law will take him down. Instead she finds herself, once again, fighting for her life. With his only ally, Cindy Paulson, Sergeant Halcombe is determined to bring the serial killer to justice.This movie gives a gritty true to life display of the events that occurred in Alaska many years ago.  The movie is very well paced and does a good job at filling the movie with tension at a frenetic pace.Cage is solid in the role as the detective and Cusask who I am not normally a fan of, does a great job as the mild mannered pathological serial killer.

THE FROZEN GROUND is a dash of both, and this adaptation is very entertaining.  It also stars a couple of actors that I really like:  Nicholas Cage and John Cusack.  Both do an excellent job in this flick, and the result is a great film worthy of your attention.I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect going into this one.  I knew what it was about, but I wasn&#8217;t sure if a full movie could be made about the topic, especially since the audience would already know who the killer was going into it.  But I&#8217;m happy to report the writer and production team do a fantastic job of weaving an intense tale within this film.  It never once lags nor disappoints in any way.THE FROZEN GROUND is shot well and looks amazing onscreen.  I tip my hat to the cinematography crew for capturing the majesty of Alaska (the film is shot on-location in and around Anchorage); the backdrops alone are enough of a reason to watch this movie.But the story and characters are truly what drive this picture.  Set in 1983, the film is a powerhouse of emotional turmoil and undulating suspense as it recreates the events that led up to the capture of Robert Hansen.  The cast does an amazing job in their roles (and yes, I am one of the minority of people who thinks Nicholas Cage can act).  I am particularly impressed with Vanessa Hudgens, who portrays the young prostitute that escapes Hansen&#8217;s captivity; she owns her role with the zeal and talent of a veteran screen actress.If I were forced to find a flaw with THE FROZEN GROUND, I simply could not do so.  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the film in my opinion.  It looks great, the acting is top notch, and the story moves at a perfect pace.  For these reasons, I recommend giving this film a look.  It is suspenseful and powerful, a perfect flick to warm up these chilly nights.

What we see is the nitty gritty of a real investigation. After the downtown Alaska Police closed the files of several girls gone missing, Nicholas Cage's detective takes on the cases and discovers at least seven missing women which climbs to 17 and possibly 30.Robert Hansen, played brilliantly by John Cusack, a mild mannered man who lived in Anchorage with his wife and children, is a serial killer. It takes many months, grueling hours and fighting the justice system for Cage's detective to bring him down. This is his story. Vanessa Hudgen plays a young 17 year old on her own, trying to make her way by selling her body for money. She had a very difficult childhood and ended up in Alaska. She was a victim of Robert Hansen, but she got away. The downtown Alaskan Police did not believe her because of her professional life. That is what these women were up against. The throw away women of our society. However, there were good policemen who wanted to serve their population, and this is also their story.

1663077,A387BD735MI50R,B00DZP1BZ0,R. Schultz,"[0, 1]","The good things about this movie:*It really is based on the true story of a series of killings that took place in Alaska in the 1970's-80's. It doesn&#8217;t just use those crimes as a coat hanger on which to hang all sorts of extreme elaborations and fabrications. It stays as close to some of the real events as a popular movie can be expected to stay.*In keeping with its realism, it was largely filmed on location, giving audiences a sense of Anchorage&#8217;s steely industrial nature and its icy insularity.*It keeps to a clean line of good versus evil. It doesn&#8217;t feel it necessary to muddy the proceedings by giving the lead police officer on the case, played by Nicholas Cage, an artificially anguished background of battling alcoholism, ex-wives, and failed fatherhood.*There are extensive bonus features on this DVD, including a fairly interesting producer/director commentary.The bad things about this movie:It never really comes off the screen and develops into a memorable three-dimensional portrayal. The intentions of everyone connected with the film were good. They wanted, not so much to magnify the deeds of the killer, but to show the humanity of his victims. They particularly wanted to feature the experiences of the killer&#8217;s one surviving victim who then becomes key to tracking him.But this young woman, who, like the killer&#8217;s other victims, was practicing as a prostitute in the large Red Light District of testosterone-soaked Anchorage, never did become quite real or comprehensible, to me at least. We don&#8217;t get to fully understand why, after her narrow escape from the killer, she would risk going back, not only generally to her old life as a prostitute - but specifically to the bars her killer is likely to frequent and where he&#8217;s likely to spot her again. Her actions, as portrayed here, seem too self-destructive to be believable.So in general, this is an earnest attempt at representing a crime, but I found that as soon as I finished the movie, it started to melt from my memory, like the ice on Anchorage streets come springtime.",3,"Earnest, But Rather Flat",1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,2095,"['good', 'things', 'movie', '*It', 'really', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'series', 'killings', 'took', 'place', 'Alaska', ""1970's-80"", '8217', 't', 'just', 'use', 'crimes', 'coat', 'hanger', 'hang', 'sorts', 'extreme', 'elaborations', 'fabrications', 'as', 'close', 'real', 'events', 'popular', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'stay', '*In', 'keeping', 'realism', 'was', 'largely', 'filmed', 'location', 'giving', 'audiences', 'sense', 'Anchorage', '8217', 'steely', 'industrial', 'nature', 'icy', 'insularity', '*It', 'keeps', 'clean', 'line', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', '8217', 'feel', 'necessary', 'muddy', 'proceedings', 'giving', 'lead', 'police', 'officer', 'case', 'played', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'artificially', 'anguished', 'background', 'battling', 'alcoholism', 'ex-wives', 'failed', 'fatherhood', 'are', 'extensive', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'including', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'producer/director', 'commentary.The', 'bad', 'things', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'screen', 'memorable', 'three-dimensional', 'portrayal', 'intentions', 'everyone', 'connected', 'film', 'were', 'good', 'wanted', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'magnify', 'deeds', 'killer', 'show', 'humanity', 'victims', 'particularly', 'wanted', 'feature', 'experiences', 'killer', '8217', 'one', 'surviving', 'victim', 'who', 'then', 'key', 'tracking', 'him.But', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'killer', '8217', 'other', 'victims', 'was', 'practicing', 'prostitute', 'large', 'Red', 'Light', 'District', 'testosterone-soaked', 'Anchorage', 'never', 'did', 'become', 'quite', 'real', 'comprehensible', 'least', 'don', '8217', 'get', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'narrow', 'escape', 'killer', 'would', 'risk', 'going', 'back', 'not', 'only', 'generally', 'old', 'life', 'prostitute', 'specifically', 'bars', 'killer', 'likely', 'frequent', 'where', '8217', 's', 'likely', 'spot', 'again', 'actions', 'portrayed', 'here', 'seem', 'too', 'self-destructive', 'be', 'believable.So', 'general', 'earnest', 'attempt', 'representing', 'crime', 'found', 'as', 'soon', 'finished', 'movie', 'started', 'melt', 'memory', 'ice', 'Anchorage', 'streets', 'come', 'springtime']",N/A

1663090,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B00DZP1BZ0,Sean Pasek,"[7, 12]","""Frozen Ground"" is a film based on the events leading up to the arrest of serial killer, Robert Hansen, who was convicted of killing four women, but is known to have killed over twenty.  Some of the best crime thrillers are those that keep the tension mounting and don't detract from the story.  ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Seven"" are still, to my mind, two of the best crime thrillers ever done.  ""Frozen Ground"" for the most part, fulfills these two requirements.  It is a solid entry of the genre that won't disappoint.Cindy Paulson (played very well by Vanessa Hudgens) is a local prostitute who has just escaped certain death at the hands of Robert Hansen.  She is found trembling in a room by police.  However, Hansen appears to have a solid alibi for his whereabouts, and due to Paulson's questionable job and character, her story is not taken as credible by the D.A.  The irony is that Paulson is the only known person to have escaped from Hansen, and yet her story is, at least initially, not believed.Enter Alaskan State Trooper, Jack Halcombe who is asked to investigate the matter.  Halcombe is based on Glenn Flothe, the actual  Alaskan State Trooper who had been investigating the discovery of several bodies of women dumped in the Alaskan wilderness.  At first, Halcombe is reluctant to investigate a case, that he feels, should be the responsibility of the local law enforcement.  However, the deeper he looks, the more convinced he becomes that Paulson is telling a credible story and that Hansen is the man responsible.Robert Hansen is a man who appears to be anything but a serial killer (yes, we've heard the profile by many law enforcement officials about how serial killers don't have a particular look).  He runs a bakery and has a wife and two children.  He has many friends, and he is even acquainted with some of the people of the Anchorage Police Department, who mostly swear that Hansen is a stand-up citizen who can't possibly be the serial killer that Halcombe is looking for.The strength of the film is in the journey, not the destination.  This isn't a film about who is doing the killing.  We all know.  It's about how Halcombe is able to finally present a solid case against Hansen.  The story takes place in the early 80s when the acquiring of forensic evidence isn't like what we see today.  Halcombe is also angry with the D.A. for not providing him with a warrant to search Hansen's property.  The D.A. argues that Halcombe has no evidence or basis for him to get a warrant.  Meanwhile, Paulson is still out there, and just how long can she survive?  Halcombe has to find evidence against Hansen and also find a way to protect Paulson, a known rebellious prostitute who is also a drug addict.The strength of the film rests with its two principle actors: John Cusack and Nicholas Cage.  This is some of the best work I've seen in years from Cage.  It reminded me of how good he can be when he chooses smart roles to play.  Cusack, who is good in just about everything he does, is exceptional as Robert Hansen.  We get a brief glimpse into the mind of Hansen and what drove him to prey on all of these women.An element that prevents this film from being even better is too much focus on Paulson.  We know that she is a key element for Halcombe, but too much time spent on her drug addiction and trying to get money by becoming a stripper takes away from the film rather than adding to it.

The story is basically about how a cop works tirelessly to bring him to justice.Lately, I have not been expecting Nicholas Cage films to be good.  In fact, I go in with very low expectations.  Seeing he was going to star in this movie with Vanessa Hudgens, that just lowered them even more.Then I saw the film.  I was surprised that it was as good as it was.  It is less than an hour and fifty minutes, so the movie moves at a pretty decent pace.  Hudgens actually surprised me.  She did a pretty good job.  She was very convincing as a prostitute.Cage's performance was not that different from other movies.  He has played a cop very often and did a very good job here.  What made this film work is mainly the chemistry between the actors.John Cusack plays Robert Hansen.  That is not a spoiler by the way.  You know he is the one early on.

The film is based on the true story of serial killer Robert Hansen.  Between 1971 and 1983, Hansen murdered between 17 and 21 women near Anchorage, Alaska. He was convicted in 1983 and is currently serving 461 years in Spring Creek Correctional Center in Seward, Alaska.  Cage plays Alaskan State Police Detective Jack Halcombe (based on real life Detective Glenn Flothe) who only has a couple of weeks left on the job before he is set to start a new position outside of police work.Halcombe gets assigned the case of an 18 year-old runaway who was allegedly abducted and raped by Hansen.  However her case was never prosecuted due to the lack of evidence.  When a decomposed body turns up whose cause of death is similar to several other unsolved murders, Halcombe begins to investigate several cold case murders and disappearances of young, local women.  Everything points to Hansen, now a prominent local businessmen and Jack has to find the evidence to take down the killer.The Frozen Ground is a pure connect-the-dot thriller that features solid performances from Cage, Cusack, and especially Vanessa Hudgens as Cindy Paulson, the runaway who escaped Hansen&#8217;s clutches.  The film also features a strong supporting cast including 50 Cent as an Anchorage street pimp, Radha Mitchell as Jack&#8217;s wife, and Kurt Fuller as the District Attorney.  But despite the strong cast Director Scott Walker is content for the standard cat and mouse game of cop and killer and attempts to add nothing new to make the plot standout.

1663131,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00DZP1BZ0,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","I find that the best thrillers come from films that are based on real life events. Some of these stories are just so twisted and crazy, that even the best writer wouldn't be able to imagine them on their own. The story told in the film The Frozen Ground, is one such story, telling the world about serial killer, Robert Hansen. From the 1970s until 1983, Hansen was one of the nations most prolific serial killers. What makes Hansen's story unique is that he was able to do all this, without the police even connecting the cases, because of where he lived. Hansen's story begins in Anchorage Alaska, where he began preying on prostitutes. After torturing and killing them, he would dump the bodies in remote, unpopulated areas of Alaska, where they were ravaged by the weather and wild animals. This made finding the cause of death or even identifying the victims nearly impossible. Hansen would probably still be active today, if it wasn't for Cindy Paulson, the only victim in 12 years, to escape the madman, and that's where our film begins. Nicholas Cage stars as Jack Halcombe, a state police detective who comes up with a wild theory that all these missing people and strange deaths, could be connected. Halcombe has a tough time convincing anyone of this, especially since his only witness is a drug abusing prostitute. Nicolas Cage excels in movies like this and is again terrific. Cage was born to play a cop and in my opinion does it better than anyone else out there. In this film, he's paired with Zac Efron's ex, Vanessa Hudgens, who wasn't great, but was much better than I expected. It's difficult to make the transition from Disney cover girl to a legitimate movie star, but I'd say that Hudgens is well on her way. Finally, John Cusack rounds out this all-star cast, playing Robert Hansen. After all the films I've seen Cusack in, I really couldn't imagine him as the bad guy, but his performance is what really helps this movie stand out, and hopefully will lead him to other similar roles. The Frozen Ground is a little slow, but it is supposedly very accurate, and tells an interesting story that most people know nothing about. It's the kind of film that I really go for and hopefully you will too.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,2219,"['find', 'best', 'thrillers', 'come', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'stories', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'twisted', 'crazy', 'even', 'best', 'writer', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'imagine', 'own', 'story', 'told', 'film', 'Frozen', 'Ground', 'one', 'such', 'story', 'telling', 'world', 'serial', 'killer', 'Robert', 'Hansen', '1970s', '1983', 'Hansen', 'was', 'one', 'nations', 'most', 'prolific', 'serial', 'killers', 'What', 'Hansen', 'story', 'unique', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'police', 'even', 'connecting', 'cases', 'where', 'lived', 'Hansen', 'story', 'Anchorage', 'Alaska', 'where', 'began', 'preying', 'prostitutes', 'torturing', 'killing', 'would', 'dump', 'bodies', 'remote', 'unpopulated', 'areas', 'Alaska', 'where', 'were', 'ravaged', 'weather', 'wild', 'animals', 'made', 'finding', 'cause', 'death', 'even', 'identifying', 'victims', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'Hansen', 'would', 'probably', 'still', 'be', 'active', 'today', 'was', ""n't"", 'Cindy', 'Paulson', 'only', 'victim', '12', 'years', 'escape', 'madman', 'where', 'film', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Jack', 'Halcombe', 'state', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'up', 'wild', 'theory', 'missing', 'people', 'strange', 'deaths', 'could', 'be', 'connected', 'Halcombe', 'tough', 'time', 'convincing', 'anyone', 'especially', 'only', 'witness', 'drug', 'abusing', 'prostitute', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'excels', 'movies', 'again', 'terrific', 'Cage', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'cop', 'opinion', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'there', 'film', 'paired', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'ex', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'difficult', 'make', 'transition', 'Disney', 'cover', 'girl', 'legitimate', 'movie', 'star', ""'d"", 'say', 'Hudgens', 'well', 'way', 'Finally', 'John', 'Cusack', 'out', 'all-star', 'cast', 'playing', 'Robert', 'Hansen', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Cusack', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'bad', 'guy', 'performance', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'stand', 'hopefully', 'will', 'lead', 'other', 'similar', 'roles', 'Frozen', 'Ground', 'little', 'slow', 'supposedly', 'very', 'accurate', 'interesting', 'story', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'nothing', 'kind', 'film', 'really', 'go', 'hopefully', 'will', 'too']",N/A

Jack Halcombe (Cage) is an Alaskan trooper a few weeks from retirement. When a young woman begins to describe the kidnapping and rape she endured at the hands a a deranged madman (Cusack) Jack wants to help. When he finds out this isn't the first time this has happened we wants nothing more then to bring him to justice. This is a true story. Many of you know of my disdain for Nicolas Cage. I don't think he's a good actor at all and his presence alone can make me think twice about watching a movie. All that said he really didn't bug me in this. Now that that's out of the way...after reading the description about this movie I was expecting something along the lines of Insomnia. I guess because it was about a serial killer in Alaska. Either way this was a good movie but started off really slow and a little boring and I found it hard to get into through out. The end did get better and I was glad I finished but this really is nothing special. A decent made-for-TV type movie that only seems better due to the cast.

To do so, Jack needs a help from a teenage girl named Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens), the only survivor of the killing spree of Robert Hansen (John Cusack), who passes for an upstanding citizen.Story-wise &#8220;The Frozen Ground&#8221; doesn&#8217;t break any new ground. The truths about what Robert Hansen did to the victims are shocking, but the story itself seems very formulaic, with a concluding third act that is a bit too short. Interestingly, writer/director Scott Walker spends considerable time following the relationship between Jack and Cindy, while some viewers might want to see Jack hunting down the killer.With strong performances from Nicolas Cage and Vanessa Hudgens, their characters are both convincing. John Cusack is also effective, creepy as a methodical murderer, while Radha Mitchell is wasted as Jack&#8217;s wife.
