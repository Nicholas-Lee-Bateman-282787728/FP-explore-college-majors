It's best described as being in the vein of Save the Last Dance and Coyote Ugly mixed together, in that it has elements of both in it.  This is actually quite interesting as I enjoyed both those, and it felt quite welcome here.The acting is just right in my opinion, though I'm pretty sure it won't win any oscars or even get nominated.  It's definitely a fun movie though so if you liked Save the Last Dance, and Coyote Ugly, you may just like this movie.",4,Save The Last Dance and Coyote Ugly met and had a baby.,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,517,"['got', 'chance', 'watch', 'flick', 'enjoyed', 'greatly', 'best', 'described', 'being', 'vein', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'mixed', 'together', 'elements', 'actually', 'quite', 'interesting', 'enjoyed', 'felt', 'quite', 'welcome', 'here.The', 'acting', 'just', 'right', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'oscars', 'even', 'get', 'nominated', 'definitely', 'fun', 'movie', 'so', 'liked', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'may', 'just', 'like', 'movie']",Make It Happen

The few burlesque performances are fun and too short. Not sure why they kept it so tame.

1186990,A3943KDQAJM85A,B001F0TM2G,Snow White,"[4, 7]","'Make it Happen' is your typical tale of a small town girl named Lauryn(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) with big dreams to leave her job working at her family auto shop and become a dancer in the big city. Of course she gets to the big audition and doesn't merit one of only twenty open spots. Lauryn can't seem to make herself admit defeat, and lucky for her she meets Dana(Tessa Thompson) who not only offers to let her crash at her place, but finds her a job at Ruby's the bar she dances at. Only Lauryn doesn't get a job as a dancer, but as an accountant instead. That is until she gets her big shot when one of the girls can't dance, and she'll have to step up and just make it happen.There's not much more to say about 'Make it Happen', we've seen this movie so many times before under different names: Center Stage, Coyote Ugly, Step Up, Save the Last Dance ... the list goes on and on. When it comes down to it the acting is fine, nothing exceptional, the same goes for the dancing. There was no specific routine that blew my mind, and no fantastically redeeming qualities to speak of.(Although, I must admit Riley Smith as Lauryn's new boytoy Russ was the one thing that really kept me interested....)'Make it Happen' is the perfect rainy day movie, grab some popcorn or hot chocolate and enjoy it for what it is, some fun, light fluff.",2,just another small town girl with dancing dreams...,1240272000,"04 21, 2009",2009,1338,"[""'Make"", 'Happen', 'typical', 'tale', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'named', 'Lauryn', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'big', 'dreams', 'leave', 'job', 'working', 'family', 'auto', 'shop', 'become', 'dancer', 'big', 'city', 'course', 'big', 'audition', ""n't"", 'merit', 'one', 'only', 'twenty', 'open', 'spots', 'Lauryn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'admit', 'defeat', 'lucky', 'Dana', 'Tessa', 'Thompson', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'let', 'crash', 'place', 'job', 'Ruby', 'bar', 'Only', 'Lauryn', ""n't"", 'get', 'job', 'dancer', 'accountant', 'instead', 'big', 'shot', 'when', 'one', 'girls', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', ""'ll"", 'have', 'step', 'up', 'just', 'make', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'say', ""'Make"", 'Happen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'different', 'names', 'Center', 'Stage', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'Step', 'Up', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'list', 'When', 'down', 'acting', 'fine', 'nothing', 'exceptional', 'same', 'dancing', 'was', 'specific', 'routine', 'blew', 'mind', 'fantastically', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'speak', 'must', 'admit', 'Riley', 'Smith', 'Lauryn', 'new', 'boytoy', 'Russ', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'kept', 'interested', ""'Make"", 'Happen', 'perfect', 'rainy', 'day', 'movie', 'grab', 'popcorn', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'enjoy', 'what', 'fun', 'light', 'fluff']",Make It Happen
