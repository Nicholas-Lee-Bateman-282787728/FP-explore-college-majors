I was a little frustrated when I first attempted it, because I had trouble with the box turn in combo 2; I'm glad I kept at it because this workout makes me feel fantastic. This is especially true during those times when I've fallen off my diet plan; ASC3 is a super calorie burner. I was doing this twice a week, but I'm adding some new Patrick G. videos for variety, until Amy hopefully finishes ASC4. This is definitely an advanced workout and one that stays in my rotation.",5,The Clear Leader in Step Workouts; Awesome!,1234137600,"02 9, 2009",2009,557,"['Nothing', 'Amy', 'love', 'challenge', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'ASC1', 'ASC2', 'was', 'little', 'frustrated', 'when', 'first', 'attempted', 'had', 'trouble', 'box', 'turn', 'combo', '2', ""'m"", 'glad', 'kept', 'workout', 'feel', 'fantastic', 'especially', 'true', 'times', 'when', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'diet', 'plan', 'ASC3', 'super', 'calorie', 'burner', 'was', 'doing', 'twice', 'week', ""'m"", 'adding', 'new', 'Patrick', 'G.', 'videos', 'variety', 'Amy', 'hopefully', 'ASC4', 'definitely', 'advanced', 'workout', 'one', 'rotation']",Advanced Step Challenge 3 with Amy Bento
1250885,A3HLVDN00UGDQ0,B00263ZHWU,Compassionate Warrior,"[19, 21]","Amy delivers again!! She's such a class act!! I just love, Love, LOVE her step workouts!!! This is another fun, full wattage, high energy, sweatfest!! Anybody who knows Amy's step knows that when she says advanced she means it. Her choreography is again so much fun and very creative and complex (somewhat less complex than Advanced Step Challenge 2 though). And, I LOVE that she always puts great, funkin, driving music to it that just drives you to keep going. It's also high energy and will make you sweat. I also love that she always puts in a low impact modifier (Toni, I believe) for anybody who has to protect their knees or needs to keep it low key. Sometime's I need to have a low impact option for a move so it's great to see that there are other options for a move to take it down a notch. I love the length of it so I have the option for a longer or shorter workout. You need to be patient learning Amy's step and I preview, preview, preview to learn it before I attempt it. I find that when I finally breakdown the code to her step patterning by watching it, then doing it comes much more smoothly. I find this is the best approach for me. But when I love something so much I'm willing to take the extra time to learn it. And find that it's such an accomplishment!! Being able to master Amy's step feels like I've hit the BIG TIMES!! I love that she's included premixes and stretching and abs. However, I kind of secretly wished that she had snuck in some circuit weight premixes like she did on ASC2 using Slo-Mo (that was AWESOME and incredibly giving of her -- she even put almost all of her Slo-Mo after the credits too -- didn't I tell you she's a class act!). It would have been amazing if she had done some circuit premixes using All Pump Xtreme. That would have been awesome!! For all who can handle complex, UNBELIEVABLY FUN, high energy step and the learning curve that goes with it, get this workout, you won't regret it!!",5,"Oh My!!

It is divided in different time periods. So, if you want to work out for 30 minutes you can do it.

I feel the choreography is more difficult to learn which is OK with patience. I wish it was slightly simpler on combo 2 is all. I do recommend it to people who like challenging choreography, and the premixes are nice to have for variety and workout length.

1250889,A2S73Z7ZR6HAMX,B00263ZHWU,Robin,"[6, 6]","I have spent countless hours doing advanced step aerobics in multiple gyms, including double-step (where you share your step with others) and rarely had any problem following.For those who aren't aware, step is designed for a high aerobic, LOW impact workout.  However, high impact jumping on and off the bench are a theme in this workout(including standard jumping jacks).  Most of the routines include high impact steps with no simple way to modify them to be low impact.I bought this because I really enjoy complicated routines however very little cueing is offered, and when it is it's too late to be of any real value. The ""warm-up"" was a few minutes of aerobics (including jumping jacks) then right into stretching.  After the stretching the instructor goes right into the aerobics again.  For me it was not an adequate warm-up, especially for what is a high impact workout.Sadly disappointed by this since the reviews were so high for this item.",1,HIGH IMPACT aerobics using a step,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,952,"['have', 'spent', 'countless', 'hours', 'doing', 'advanced', 'step', 'aerobics', 'multiple', 'gyms', 'including', 'double-step', 'where', 'share', 'step', 'others', 'rarely', 'had', 'problem', 'following.For', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'step', 'designed', 'high', 'aerobic', 'LOW', 'impact', 'workout', 'However', 'high', 'impact', 'jumping', 'bench', 'are', 'theme', 'workout', 'including', 'standard', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'Most', 'routines', 'include', 'high', 'impact', 'steps', 'simple', 'way', 'modify', 'be', 'low', 'impact.I', 'bought', 'really', 'enjoy', 'complicated', 'routines', 'however', 'very', 'little', 'cueing', 'offered', 'when', 'too', 'late', 'be', 'real', 'value', 'warm-up', 'was', 'few', 'minutes', 'aerobics', 'including', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'then', 'right', 'stretching', 'stretching', 'instructor', 'right', 'aerobics', 'again', 'was', 'not', 'adequate', 'warm-up', 'especially', 'what', 'high', 'impact', 'workout.Sadly', 'disappointed', 'reviews', 'were', 'so', 'high', 'item']",Advanced Step Challenge 3 with Amy Bento

After learning the routine I play one of the premixes to skip the ""learning"" portions of the routine and jump directly into the broken down combos.
