Aside from Justice League/JLU in the early 2000s, this is one of the top comic book based cartoons of the new era, so far. So much greatness and surprises from the entire series: from the addition of new characters (Annilus!) to the formation of the, even though one episode, New Avengers. So what if the episodes weren't put together exactly how they were aired, if you're looking for entertainment then this is it. Marvel/Disney failed for cancelling this show since it had so much potential for the future. Imagine if they did Civil War? or Infinity Gauntlet? They dropped the ball on this one. I was happy to see a Secret Invasion arc and one of my favorite characters, Adam Warlock (even though he wasn't really as awesome as he is when Starlin was doing him in the comics).
