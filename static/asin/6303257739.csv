366629,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,6303257739,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[3, 3]","I'm in the first catagory.I have to make one thing clear, before I delve into why I like this movie so much, and it's the misconceptions about the title. It's called ""Neighbors,"" not ""The Neighbors."" This seems a small point, but it's not. ""The Neighbors"" denotes the people next door only, and calling it ""Neighbors (no 'the')"" tells the viewer that it's about the people in both homes. It's the interaction between both families.This film has a creepy, dream-like quality to it, and that itself, is a part of the cast, as much as the actors. The odd sound effects, and the fact that a large part of the story happens overnight, adds to it all. Just look at the scenery, even in the daylight shots.It's a bizarre film, it's hard to describe, and all I can say, is you have to see it for yourself to see what is meant here. John Belushi plays the straight man to Dan Aykroyd's lunatic, and even though Aykroyd's and Cathy Moriarty's characters are free-wheeling and likable, to a degree, they are ANNOYING! Very little consideration for the people they just moved in next door to, they are an exaggerated version of the neighbors we all dread having.Little sublties are important in this kind of film, like the choice of music; In a scene where Belushi's character is dressing up to impress the woman next door (Moriarty), the soundtrack is playing ""Stayin' Alive"" by The Bee Gees. Things like this, are what make it funny, but it's actually the characterizations and the ""ATMOSPHERE"" which make this such a good film. Look at the camera angles, listen to the eerie sound effects, and the blue contact lenses that Dan Aykroyd wears, they just change his whole persona.I didn't think I could appreciate John Belushi acting the part of such a straight arrow, especially after seeing him in ""1941"" and ""Animal House,"" and even more so, his years on ""Second City TV"" and ""Saturday Night Live,"" but he does the part well, and I'll admit, I fell into that trap, where I was expecting him to be typecast, and was disappointed at first by his being cast as such a harmless character, but he does it well, and I think it was proper casting. Great comedian, but here he proves he's a versatile actor. As a fan, I miss him.As I said earlier, you'll either love this movie, or you'll hate it.

For the most part the critics trashed the film though as I recall Siskel and Ebert liked it.  Leonard Maltin's movie guide assigns the dreaded BOMB rating.  Some thirty years on time has been kind to John Belushi's final film.  Either that or the critics are mindless lemmings who wouldn't know a good movie if it bit them.  This movie led me to Thomas Berger's source novel which was good too but the makers of the film take obvious liberties.  Truth be told when they are true to the book ""Neighbors"" feels a little flat.  It's in the improvisation of Belushi and Dan Aykroyd where the film takes off.  It's interesting how they cast the lead characters.  Belushi was better known as the anarchist and Aykroyd the straight man.  It's an inspiring fluorish making Belushi the repressed suburbanite and Aykroyd the maniacal bohemian.""Neighbors"" is a terrific bit of dark comedy peppered with inspired verbal and physical wit.  There are so many terrific bits but one particularly stands out.  It involves Aykroyd's Vic inviting Belushi's Earl over for a cup of coffee.  Vic presents him with a filthy cup and Earl's reaction is pricelessly classic.  Also noteworthy is a terrific comic score by Bill Conti, one of my all time favorites.

However, the ""black humor"" that this movie supposedly delivers is just a bunch of mindless, quasi-violent chaos.  I didn't care for it but, obviously, many people did.  What really got me about this movie was the opening statement that was shown before the cast and credits.

Siskel and Ebert's thumbs didn't know what to do.  All the elements were there.  How could this miss?If you read Bob Woodward's excellent book about Belushi's final days, ""Wired"", there was no hope WHILE THEY WERE FILMING IT.  The producers fumbled when they chose ROCKY director John Avlidsen to direct (their logic was that they could hit comedy gold by hiring a humorless, serious director--say, like a Stanley Kubrick--and letting him direct a dark comic screenplay--like DR. STRANGELOVE, for instance).Wrong.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  Belushi wanted to kill the director just days into shooting, publicly announcing that Avlidsen knew nothing about humor or comic timing.  Switching Aykroyd & Belushi to play against type was a bold move but this movie just flogs along, never finding itself and definitely blowing any chance for a funny scene.It's too bad.  The movie sank like a stone in Christmas of '81.  On March 5th, 1982, John Belushi died on Sunset Boulevard, a sqaulid death and a Hollywood tragedy because he never got the chance to prove himself after NEIGHBORS.  Sad.At least we'll always have ""Saturday Night Live"" (which is being released by each season, thankfully) and NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE.",1,There's No Other Word for This: Disaster,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,1613,"['could', ""n't"", 'find', 'bigger', 'fan', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'going', 'Christmas', 'holiday', '1981', 'then', 'released', 'NEIGHBORS.At', 'least', 'Spielberg', '1979', 'bomb', '1941', 'was', 'enough', 'special', 'effects', 'mayhem', 'keep', 'audience', 'distracted', 'what', 'vapid', 'stinkbomb', 'movie', 'really', 'added', 'up', 'to.When', 'NEIGHBORS', 'came', 'out', 'everyone', 'knew', 'stank', 'first', 'screening', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'thumbs', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'elements', 'were', 'there', 'How', 'could', 'miss', 'read', 'Bob', 'Woodward', 'excellent', 'book', 'Belushi', 'final', 'days', 'Wired', 'was', 'hope', 'THEY', 'WERE', 'FILMING', 'IT', 'producers', 'fumbled', 'when', 'chose', 'ROCKY', 'director', 'John', 'Avlidsen', 'direct', 'logic', 'was', 'could', 'hit', 'comedy', 'gold', 'hiring', 'humorless', 'serious', 'director', 'say', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'letting', 'direct', 'dark', 'comic', 'screenplay', 'DR.', 'STRANGELOVE', 'instance', '.Wrong', 'Wrong', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'Belushi', 'wanted', 'kill', 'director', 'just', 'days', 'shooting', 'publicly', 'announcing', 'Avlidsen', 'knew', 'nothing', 'humor', 'comic', 'timing', 'Switching', 'Aykroyd', 'Belushi', 'play', 'type', 'was', 'bold', 'move', 'movie', 'just', 'flogs', 'along', 'never', 'finding', 'definitely', 'blowing', 'chance', 'funny', 'scene.It', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'sank', 'stone', 'Christmas', ""'81"", 'March', '5th', '1982', 'John', 'Belushi', 'died', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'sqaulid', 'death', 'Hollywood', 'tragedy', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'prove', 'NEIGHBORS', 'Sad.At', 'least', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'being', 'released', 'season', 'thankfully', 'NATIONAL', 'LAMPOON', 'ANIMAL', 'HOUSE']",Neighbors VHS

By admission, I did not find The Blues Brothers to be a great comedy.  Just mildly amusing.  I feel this is Belushi's best work on film by far.  He plays a stiff suit wearing guy that has a less shy inhibited wife and daughter that test his feelings of propriety.  When the new neighbors move in, this stiff guy feels very threatened by the husband(Dan Aykroyd) and strangely attracted to his blunt tease of a wife(Cathy Moriarty).  The new neighbors completely disrupt Belushi's household and test his sanity.  The movie is hilarious to me but to someone who likes straight-ahead comedies, this one may not be for you.
