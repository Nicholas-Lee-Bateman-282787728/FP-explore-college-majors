501772,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,B00000I1LL,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[2, 3]","The 1998 version of the 1962 low-budget horror classic.It was a bad idea to classify this as a ""horror"" story, even though some of the events do qualify as horror. But too many people try to match this to the original, and that in itself is a mistake. In the day where original films are passe, at least this tries to make a new story based on a similar premise. That being a young woman is made to face her fear.The Phillips character (Alex), as a young naive girl, witnesses the rape and murder of her mother, and could have shot this fiend (Louis, portrayed by Larry Miller) before he killed her; he foolishly left his gun on the nightstand. Watching the mother character's neck snap in the hands of Louis, is singularly unpleasant to watch, and downright disturbing. Instead, she panics and runs. He was obviously caught, and served twenty years for his offense, and now he's out to even the score (""I never hold a grudge, once I get even"").It's about sacrifice, facing the thing that scares you the most, and letting your worries go. Many times in the film, the Sandra character (Shawnee Smith) tells her big sister not to worry about her, ""You worry too much, I'll be fine."" Alex sees herself as the reason the girls were orphaned so early, and denied the relationship with their mother; she could have shot Louis before he killed her mother (the father was absent all along, pretty typical in too many families) and fretted over Sandra as if she were her own daughter. In an act of closure, on the twentieth anniversary of the murder, Alex goes to the seaside to let the wind blow the ashes of her dead mother over the ocean, and when she returns to the car, there's a balloon on her car's windshield wiper. Louis has obviously been stalking her, and at gunpoint, he decides it's time to finish old business. You are forced to drive to your home and watch this monster at work again. So what do you do? With a murderer's gun to your ear, you floor your gas pedal, steer your car off the pier, and even though you die yourself, you rid the world of this filth who has ruined at least three lives.The entire middle of the film (from the bathtub scene until the second time the car plunges into the water) is a personal journey through life in an alternate dimension. Her aquaintences are all there, with their own lives, but everything they say and do, is geared to her dilemma. She's dead, and refuses to face it. She is afraid to leave her sister behind, and afraid of the man who has tormented her for twenty years, and afraid to move to the next. The ""beings,"" I'll call them, are symbolic of crucial times , people and events in her world, and they are called ""annoying"" by some people, but they are symbolic of personal demons in her life; they pop up at crucial moments. Startling to look at, because they come in so unexpectedly, they are meant to catch you off guard, as they do Alex.The events are about closure, and moving on, and in one flashback scene toward the end, the old man in the bar asks her, ""You're not afraid, are you?"" And again, Sandra says ""You worry too much; I'll be fine.""Again, it's not necessarily horror per se, though some horror elements are present.It's a movie about life, that's all.",5,"HEAVY DRAMA, LOTS OF LESSONS ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH, BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT A.D.D.

501777,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B00000I1LL,Joker,"[1, 1]","To find out what the plot is about, read other reviews.  Or better yet, watch the 1962 cult classic instead of this.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...In 1998 Wes Craven decided he wanted to remake the Herk Harvey 1962 B horror movie cult classic ""Carnival of Souls"".  He remade it, alright.  He made it so different from the original, yet so familiar.  It has a very similar plot, but it's just so '90s-ish.  It's not dark, spooky, and subtle like the original is.  The original is one of the best psychological horror films of all time.  In contrast, this remake is more bizarre, more graphic, and more sinister than the original.  It's just a typical modern day horror movie.  It's very confusing as well.  It seems like every few minutes a scene will play out and end up being a dream.  This happens many times throughout the movie.  This movie is really an insult to the original.  This movie's carnival isn't anything like the Saltair Pavillion.  The Saltair Pavillion was abandoned and eerie.  The carnival in this remake, in contrast, is operating and full of patrons.  The clown can't compare to the ghoul in the original.  You want eerie music?  Watch the original.  In my opinion, the original is a movie that can't be remade.  It just can't.  It just can't be made better.  It's like The Wizard of Oz - don't anybody ever dare to remake that movie.If you approach this movie with an unbiased open mind and take it at face value when watching it, you might like it.  I think it would help if the viewer has never seen the original.  If this is the case, the viewer probably will rate this movie higher than he/she would if they've seen the original first.  Myself, I think this is a 2 star movie when I take it at face value.  I would still rate it at 2 stars if I had never seen the original.",2,"A so-called ""remake""",1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,1819,"['find', 'out', 'what', 'plot', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'better', 'yet', 'watch', '1962', 'cult', 'classic', 'instead', 'just', 'want', 'give', 'thoughts', 'movie', '1998', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'decided', 'wanted', 'remake', 'Herk', 'Harvey', '1962', 'B', 'horror', 'movie', 'cult', 'classic', 'Carnival', 'Souls', 'remade', 'alright', 'made', 'so', 'different', 'original', 'yet', 'so', 'familiar', 'very', 'similar', 'plot', 'just', 'so', ""'90s-ish"", 'not', 'dark', 'spooky', 'subtle', 'original', 'original', 'one', 'best', 'psychological', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'contrast', 'remake', 'more', 'bizarre', 'more', 'graphic', 'more', 'sinister', 'original', 'just', 'typical', 'modern', 'day', 'horror', 'movie', 'very', 'confusing', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'minutes', 'scene', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'dream', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'movie', 'really', 'insult', 'original', 'movie', 'carnival', ""n't"", 'anything', 'Saltair', 'Pavillion', 'Saltair', 'Pavillion', 'was', 'abandoned', 'eerie', 'carnival', 'remake', 'contrast', 'operating', 'full', 'patrons', 'clown', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'ghoul', 'original', 'want', 'eerie', 'music', 'Watch', 'original', 'opinion', 'original', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'remade', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'made', 'better', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'do', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'ever', 'dare', 'remake', 'movie.If', 'approach', 'movie', 'unbiased', 'open', 'mind', 'take', 'face', 'value', 'when', 'watching', 'might', 'like', 'think', 'would', 'help', 'viewer', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'case', 'viewer', 'probably', 'will', 'rate', 'movie', 'higher', 'he/she', 'would', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'first', 'think', '2', 'star', 'movie', 'when', 'take', 'face', 'value', 'would', 'still', 'rate', '2', 'stars', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'original']",Carnival Of Souls
501778,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B00000I1LL,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","As most reviews have mentioned on here, this Carnival of Souls is a remake of the 1962 Carnival of Souls. And while I haven't seen the original yet, I probably should've spent money on that one rather than spending money on the 1998 version.This film revolves around our main protagonist, Alex Grant. 20 years before, Alex witnessed the rape and murder of her mother at the hands of a sadistic carnival clown named Louis Seagram. 20 years later, Alex and her sister, Sandra are grown up and working as bartenders, while Louis has just been released from prison, just as the anniversary of their mother's death is approaching.One night as she enters her car, she's confronted by Louis who snuck into her car and pulls a gun on her. In order to escape him, Alex drives her car off a dock and into a lake, which sets off a chain of haunting events.From there on, Alex is haunted by a plague of evil and demonic-like visions while being tormented by Louis in a vile cat and mouse game of life or death.Overall: Let me just start off by saying that if you want scares and kills, this movie is not for you. This is more of a psychological horror movie so the film focuses more on trying to get inside the character and viewer's mind rather than scaring. Unfortunately this movie turns out to be a complete bummer. I remember watching this many years ago but couldn't remember most of the film so I decided to buy it and watch it again. Not a good idea. The plot of it is great but the movie overall isn't all that great. The main reason being that it is extremely confusing and hard to keep up with. The movie constantly jumps all over the place from one setting to the next without there being any real explanation or reason why. For example Alex will have a vision she's in her car and then she'll be in her bathtub. Then later she'd be on a boat and then it'd jump to her being on a ferris wheel. They're so busy trying to take the movie so many places, they don't even explain the meaning of it and ultimately ends up making no sense.Perhaps if they took the time to diligently make the movie less confusing, I'd have been more receptive to it and it would've earned maybe a 4/5 stars. The only thing that saves it from being a 1/5 is the decent plot. The ending is one of those endings where it leaves you with more questions than answers. Originally this movie was scheduled for a wide theatrical release in the Summer of 1998 but due to several negative critics on the movie in limited theatrical releases, it soon became a straight to video release. Not hard to see why, this film had potential to be great but unfortunately fell short. Don't bother watching this. It's too much of a headache to sit through this 80+ minutes trying to figure out what's going on",2,Don't Bother Watching It,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,2763,"['most', 'reviews', 'have', 'mentioned', 'here', 'Carnival', 'Souls', 'remake', '1962', 'Carnival', 'Souls', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'yet', 'probably', 'should', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'money', 'one', 'rather', 'spending', 'money', '1998', 'version.This', 'film', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Alex', 'Grant', '20', 'years', 'before', 'Alex', 'witnessed', 'rape', 'murder', 'mother', 'hands', 'sadistic', 'carnival', 'clown', 'named', 'Louis', 'Seagram', '20', 'years', 'later', 'Alex', 'sister', 'Sandra', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'working', 'bartenders', 'Louis', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'just', 'anniversary', 'mother', 'death', 'approaching.One', 'night', 'car', 'confronted', 'Louis', 'who', 'snuck', 'car', 'gun', 'order', 'escape', 'Alex', 'car', 'dock', 'lake', 'off', 'chain', 'haunting', 'events.From', 'there', 'Alex', 'haunted', 'plague', 'evil', 'demonic-like', 'visions', 'being', 'tormented', 'Louis', 'vile', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'life', 'death.Overall', 'Let', 'just', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'want', 'scares', 'kills', 'movie', 'not', 'more', 'psychological', 'horror', 'movie', 'film', 'more', 'trying', 'get', 'character', 'viewer', 'mind', 'rather', 'scaring', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'complete', 'bummer', 'remember', 'watching', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'most', 'film', 'decided', 'buy', 'watch', 'again', 'Not', 'good', 'idea', 'plot', 'great', 'movie', 'overall', ""n't"", 'great', 'main', 'reason', 'being', 'extremely', 'confusing', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'movie', 'constantly', 'place', 'one', 'setting', 'next', 'being', 'real', 'explanation', 'reason', 'why', 'example', 'Alex', 'will', 'have', 'vision', 'car', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bathtub', 'Then', 'later', ""'d"", 'be', 'boat', 'then', ""'d"", 'jump', 'being', 'ferris', 'wheel', ""'re"", 'so', 'busy', 'trying', 'take', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'places', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'explain', 'meaning', 'ultimately', 'up', 'making', 'sense.Perhaps', 'took', 'time', 'diligently', 'make', 'movie', 'less', 'confusing', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'receptive', 'would', ""'ve"", 'earned', 'maybe', '4/5', 'stars', 'only', 'thing', 'being', '1/5', 'decent', 'plot', 'ending', 'one', 'endings', 'where', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'Originally', 'movie', 'was', 'scheduled', 'wide', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Summer', '1998', 'due', 'several', 'negative', 'critics', 'movie', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'soon', 'became', 'straight', 'video', 'release', 'Not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'unfortunately', 'fell', 'short', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching', 'too', 'much', 'headache', 'sit', '80+', 'minutes', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going']",Carnival Of Souls

The 1962 original was atmospheric, darkly poetic, haunting; its story a subtle balance between two alternate interpretations.This is none of those.  This remake is a clunky mess, arbitrarily meandering through pointless  scenes and aimless &quot;monsters&quot; lifted from JACOB'S LADDER.Aside from the monsters, a line, too, is lifted from JACOB'S LADDER.  The one about demons and angels.  This makes *some* sense, as both the  original CARNIVAL OF SOULS and JACOB'S LADDER are inspired by Bierce's  &quot;Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge.&quot;The 1962 film had a beginning,  a middle, and a twist ending.  This 1998 remake has numerous beginnings,  middles, and ends.  Scenes switch back and forth as the lead character  keeps &quot;waking up&quot; to indicate that all that went on before was a  dream.  If not for the rough road map provided by the original film, we'd  have an even murkier idea of what's going on.Basically, a woman drives  into the river, and at times seems to have escaped, at times is just now  escaping, at times appears never to have driven into the river at  all...Not clever, just confused and confusing.The original film's  cool lead actress portrayed a young woman afraid of life, who &quot;hadn't  really lived.&quot;  It was subtle, yet the point was made.  In this new  version, the character helpfully tells the audience that she &quot;hasn't  lived,&quot; in case we don't &quot;get it.&quot;The pedophilia  &quot;update&quot; to the original film's storyline doesn't add  anything.This 1998 film's lead actress, Bobbie Phillips,  guest-starred  as the &quot;bug woman&quot; in THE X-FILES.",1,An insult to its source material,961113600,"06 16, 2000",2000,1693,"['film', 'remake', '1962', 'horror', 'classic', 'same', 'name', '1962', 'original', 'was', 'atmospheric', 'darkly', 'poetic', 'haunting', 'story', 'subtle', 'balance', 'two', 'alternate', 'interpretations.This', 'none', 'remake', 'clunky', 'mess', 'arbitrarily', 'meandering', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'aimless', 'quot', 'monsters', 'quot', 'lifted', 'JACOB', 'LADDER.Aside', 'monsters', 'line', 'too', 'lifted', 'JACOB', 'LADDER', 'one', 'demons', 'angels', '*some*', 'sense', 'original', 'CARNIVAL', 'OF', 'SOULS', 'JACOB', 'LADDER', 'are', 'inspired', 'Bierce', 'quot', 'Occurance', 'Owl', 'Creek', 'Bridge.', 'quot', '1962', 'film', 'had', 'beginning', 'middle', 'twist', 'ending', '1998', 'remake', 'numerous', 'beginnings', 'middles', 'Scenes', 'switch', 'back', 'forth', 'lead', 'character', 'keeps', 'quot', 'waking', 'up', 'quot', 'indicate', 'went', 'was', 'dream', 'not', 'rough', 'road', 'map', 'provided', 'original', 'film', ""'d"", 'have', 'even', 'murkier', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'on.Basically', 'woman', 'river', 'times', 'have', 'escaped', 'times', 'just', 'now', 'escaping', 'times', 'never', 'have', 'driven', 'river', 'Not', 'clever', 'just', 'confused', 'confusing.The', 'original', 'film', 'cool', 'lead', 'actress', 'portrayed', 'young', 'woman', 'afraid', 'life', 'who', 'quot', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'lived.', 'quot', 'was', 'subtle', 'yet', 'point', 'was', 'made', 'new', 'version', 'character', 'helpfully', 'audience', 'quot', ""n't"", 'lived', 'quot', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'quot', 'get', 'it.', 'quot', 'pedophilia', 'quot', 'update', 'quot', 'original', 'film', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything.This', '1998', 'film', 'lead', 'actress', 'Bobbie', 'Phillips', 'guest-starred', 'quot', 'woman', 'quot', 'X-FILES']",Carnival Of Souls

Later as an adult she is haunted by her past when the carnival comes back to town.I loved the original black and white Carnival of Souls movie and I'm usually a little skittish about remakes.  I must admit that I was given some forewarning that Wes Craven changed the plot in this one, which probably helped my overall take on it.  So from the start I wasn't expecting much.In this version the girl and her sister own a bar.  There is no church and no organ music, which takes away from the eeriness that we all loved.  Hmm how to describe?  In another review someone described the original b&w; movie as being ""darkly poetic and haunting,"" which can't be said any better.  In this version, Wes Craven turns the carnival into a brighter, more chaotic and psychotic place.  The ending is similar in the sense that everything is not what it seemed, but obviously with the different plot comes an entirely new scene.Shawnee Smith is in this film, which is a definite bonus.  Also Larry Miller plays a great sicko clown!I'm giving the movie a 2.5.  Compared to the original, the movie deserves a 1 or less.  However, anyone who enjoys Wes Craven flicks and sees this movie  before seeing the original will probably enjoy it enough to rate it a 3 or 4.  So I'll be generous and rate in the middle.",2,"Not as good as the original, but it didn't suck as much as I was expecting it to.",1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,1420,"['young', 'girl', 'mother', 'violently', 'killed', 'hands', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'carnival', 'clown', 'Later', 'adult', 'haunted', 'past', 'when', 'carnival', 'back', 'town.I', 'loved', 'original', 'black', 'white', 'Carnival', 'Souls', 'movie', ""'m"", 'usually', 'little', 'skittish', 'remakes', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'given', 'forewarning', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'changed', 'plot', 'one', 'probably', 'helped', 'overall', 'take', 'So', 'start', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much.In', 'version', 'girl', 'sister', 'bar', 'church', 'organ', 'music', 'away', 'eeriness', 'loved', 'Hmm', 'how', 'describe', 'review', 'someone', 'described', 'original', 'b', 'w', 'movie', 'being', 'darkly', 'poetic', 'haunting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'better', 'version', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'carnival', 'brighter', 'more', 'chaotic', 'psychotic', 'place', 'ending', 'similar', 'sense', 'everything', 'not', 'what', 'seemed', 'obviously', 'different', 'plot', 'entirely', 'new', 'scene.Shawnee', 'Smith', 'film', 'definite', 'bonus', 'Also', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'great', 'sicko', 'clown', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', '2.5', 'Compared', 'original', 'movie', '1', 'less', 'However', 'anyone', 'who', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'flicks', 'movie', 'seeing', 'original', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'enough', 'rate', '3', '4', 'So', ""'ll"", 'be', 'generous', 'rate', 'middle']",Carnival Of Souls
