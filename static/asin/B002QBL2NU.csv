1283756,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B002QBL2NU,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","The small town of Bangor, Maine is the possessor of surprising asset: as the easternmost international airport in the US, its freakishly long (2+ mile), wide runway and location on the ""Great Circle Route"" have made it the entree-way for waves of returning US troops.  For many of these servicemen and women, it's a shock for them to touch down there at odd hours and - instead of getting the sleepy stopover they anticipated - be greeted by a raucous, cheering crowd welcoming their return.Who are the people lining these halls?  That's the question that 'The Way We Get By' seeks to answer.  Shown on PBS as part of the POV series, this brilliant film from co-producers Gita Pullapilly and Aron Gaudet packs an unexpected emotional punch.The producers were working in TV at different mid-west stations when they were introduced by mutual friends who knew that the two had both expressed interest in making documentaries.  While searching around for material, Gaudet slowly became aware of his mother's new-found passion for troop-greeting.  Over the years, Joan Gaudet has developed a fear of going out after dark due to a knee operation and reliance on a walker.  Suddenly, her troop-greeting responsibilities were driving her to spring out of bed and race to the airport at 2 AM.  Producers Gaudet and Pullapilly (now husband and wife) looked at each other and realized they had their story right in front of them.The producers found the halls filled with similar stories - troop-greeting as ""the way we get by""...whether it be Joan Gaudet's empty nest, Bill Knight's cancer and debt concerns, or Jerry Mundy's wistful remembrances of his son's death and the recent death of a close friend.  What connects the three is their abject loneliness...and the camaraderie and sense of purpose that the group brings to them.Never stooping to melodrama or mawkishness, Gaudet and Pullapilly bring you into these three lives in a compelling way.  It's a fascinating tale well-deserving of its Emmy nomination.",5,Who are the people lining these halls?

1283757,A3C54XWT93R2WY,B002QBL2NU,"Been around this block, several times over","[4, 7]","There they are, three old ""conservative looking"" people, making a thing out of showing up endlessly at a Maine airport and simply saying ""Welcome Back!"" to troops returning from Iraq.  They obviously remember Viet Nam and how that era said, ""So, you're back, killers!"" . . . and their memories obviously weigh on them.But after watching only a bit, it becomes clear that it is in fact their memories that weigh upon these elders, and not any political spectrum position.  One is immediately reminded of another recently aired documentary about a tattoo parlor that examines the psychical interaction of remembering oldsters and troops about to go, re-enlisting to return, or just coming back to the blank space of Iraq veteranship.  This rough and tough, burly white haired tattooist, is seen at the end bawling like a baby from the weight of memories.  So the alien and ugly suddenly becomes warm, human, a chronicle of people trapped in a very small range of available modes to express in little ways very, VERY big ideas.  It's that working class again, losing ground because of their post-modernist inarticulateness, just as they have lost ground for such reason as regards the unions that used to protect their remunerative relevance to American life.  Only this time, such working class people are trying to address something even bigger--the in-tandem passing of time and life over the horizon--and I was in full-blown tears!I'm an active psychotherapist, working as well as a clinical administrator in a large state psychiatric hospital.  So my own years have not as yet succeeded in weighing on me as their years seem to have weighed on these already long side-lined old people.  I am articulate, and this ability can take many social years off of my persona.  I also dodged the Viet Nam bullet, never having had to serve.  But I immediately descend into uncontrollable bawling from a bottomless sense of loss at even a from--the-corner-of-the-eye sight of the Viet Nam memorial.I did my life-and-death thing as a refugee from Soviet Communism in childhood, but I finally made it to the land of milk and honey--however, we escaped Eastern Europe with only immediate family around us to grow up with.  So for me, the death of my father, to be followed by the threat of the always all-too-soon-to-come passing of my 90+ years old mother, doesn't ever let me feel very far from utter familial orphanhood (no matter how old I get . . . which is what reducing ourselves to nuclear families will do to us).My parents were deeply weighed down all their lives by agonizing memories of the Communist beast, and they expressed their feelings about that . . . much as our ""conservative""-seeming central personages in this beautiful film expressed the weight of their feelings.  Well, one day, some five years after Glaznost and Ghorbachov (I'm not sure exactly how to spell either, and I don't want to look them up lest I lose my train of thought), it suddenly occurred to me that the most central issue in my mother's life--what the Communist beast had wrought--had suddenly dropped out of human history, it very quickly became little more that an obscure footnote that only highly specialized scholars with terribly esoteric interests could recall with any degree of vividness.  While on the one hand I thought, ""Good Riddance!""--it was soon evident to me that what so much of my mother's life had been about had now fallen over the edge into obscurity.  Thanks to the Jewish passion for historical identity, people will always remember the horrors on Nazism; but what my elderly mother suffered has become by our current times a NEVER-EXISTED (or a ""Don't bore me with that weird stuff any more"" thing)!  Something like this seemed to threaten the main characters of this movie.So my viewing of this film was--as an old professor of traditional Chinese art and philosophy used to say in his horribly thick accent which I could somehow understand clear as a bell-- ""full and pregnant with SUGGESTIVENESS!""  Thus, I'm left initially a bit at sea as to whether the richness I experienced viewing this film came from me or from the filmmakers.  However, great art is always an experience capable of arousing us to our noblest human awareness--and lately I've been watching a lot of great films.  The depth to which this film was able to reach into my internally quite cluttered soul must surely go to the credit of the filmmakers and the people they reveal to us.  I consequently recommend this monumental work highly--particularly to our gadgetry-and-stimuli-saturated youth, whose own souls sometimes seem relatively quite empty to me, while the outer surface of their lives seems overwhelmingly cluttered.",5,"When in history, old bodies overwhelm old minds",1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,4705,"['are', 'three', 'old', 'conservative', 'looking', 'people',

1283759,AVU1ILDDYW301,B002QBL2NU,G. Hearn,"[0, 0]","Though this DVD is centered around three main ""characters"" (Bill, Joan & Jerry) it's also about all of the troop greeters at the Bangor Maine airport.  I've watched it at least a dozen times.  It, along with ""Taking Chance"" are my two favorite movies of this genre.Many U.S. troops pass through the Bangor Maine airport either flying to the Middle East, or returning. . . or both.  No matter what time of day or night they arrive, there are always ""greeters"" there to meet them.  I think the troops are quite surprised at the reception given by the veterans and civilians alike in Bangor.  It's heart-warming, inspiring, and moving.As we go on this journey with Bill, Joan and Jerry, we find out that none of them have had the easiest life.  But for all of their turmoil, very little stops them from going to the airport, no matter the time.  In a certain way, I think it's one of the things that keeps them going and gives them a purpose in life.I also like the fact that when you purchase the DVD you also have access to it through Your Video Library so you can watch it on your computer, TiVo, RoKu, etc.Taking Chance",5,"LOVE this Movie!

1283760,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B002QBL2NU,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[5, 5]","The Way We Get By paints a stunning portrait of three older people who have selflessly donated so much of their time, day and night, over the last six or more years to greeting soldiers returning home from serving overseas. They sometimes have to say farewell to troops leaving for war-torn areas as well. On a deeper level, however, the film meaningfully explores the universal issues of mortality and aging; this makes the picture a standout because many of us, understandably, don't always think as much about these things as we should. After all, it can be painful to deal with mortality, aging and war, but this film doesn't hurt feelings the way it might have if it had been in less capable hands. Director/writer Aron Gaudet sensitively and brilliantly deals with these themes in this film; and that's wonderful. The story line of this documentary will move you greatly as it moved me; and I cannot help but admire the magnificent way in which we get to get to know the three senior citizens who have volunteered to meet and greet the troops at the airport in Bangor, Maine. In addition, the cinematography works great and the flow of the film is just right; the editing couldn't have been better.Specifically, the three seniors we meet and come to know are Joan Gaudet, William Knight and Gerald Mundy. Joan, an elderly widow, retains a feisty personality. Despite her having to take seventeen pills a day of prescription medication, we see Joan driving to the Bangor airport at all hours of the day or night and she scarcely ever complains. William, a rather lonesome elderly man who misses his late wife as well as his time in the military, also routinely makes it to the airport despite his cancer. Gerald also feels quite alone, especially after his dog dies, and his dedication to their project of greeting the troops is remarkable.Of course, there's much more to know about these three people, their interactions with the troops and this story in general than what I've written here. It may seem as if I've given too much away; but I haven't. I don't want to spoil it for you.The DVD comes with a brief section of production notes and a list of honors and awards it won after it was released. The film received sixteen honors and awards--outstanding! I would have liked a director's commentary but the film is just so well done and memorable that I can overlook this.The Way We Get By is one of the most sensitive, poignant and insightful films to date concerning the emotional issues of war, mortality and aging.
