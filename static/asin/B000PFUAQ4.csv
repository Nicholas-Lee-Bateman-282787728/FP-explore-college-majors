Some classify it as a sex comedy, but at its heart it really isn't any such thing.  Yes, there are a couple of semi-nude scenes, but they really aren't central to the story.  Instead, this is a story about the anxiety of losing one's diary.  In this case, it isn't a social life diary, but an intellectual life diary.  All kinds of comical situations arise when Bickford's precious book is stolen by a young vixen, then lost by her boyfriend.  It is a pleasant surprise to watch a movie where one's intellect, as expressed in 'the book,' is admired by all who come into contact with this unusual diary.  There is a bit of coarse language, but not as much as is usual in these type of comedies.  Also, the laughs do not arise out of slapstick drivel, but out of the unexpected logical outcome of its setup.",4,A Sensible Comedy,1224720000,"10 23, 2008",2008,876,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'classify', 'sex', 'comedy', 'heart', 'really', ""n't"", 'such', 'thing', 'Yes', 'are', 'couple', 'semi-nude', 'scenes', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'central', 'story', 'Instead', 'story', 'anxiety', 'losing', 'one', 'diary', 'case', ""n't"", 'social', 'life', 'diary', 'intellectual', 'life', 'diary', 'kinds', 'comical', 'situations', 'arise', 'when', 'Bickford', 'precious', 'book', 'stolen', 'young', 'vixen', 'then', 'lost', 'boyfriend', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'watch', 'movie', 'where', 'one', 'intellect', 'expressed', ""'the"", 'book', 'admired', 'who', 'come', 'contact', 'unusual', 'diary', 'bit', 'coarse', 'language', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'usual', 'type', 'comedies', 'Also', 'laughs', 'do', 'not', 'arise', 'slapstick', 'drivel', 'unexpected', 'logical', 'outcome', 'setup']",Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas

That alone got me through the film, because if I'd actually expected this film to be funny or good, I'd have turned it off halfway through. This flick tries really, really hard to be a lot of things & in the end it got bogged down under it's own weight.The plot is incredibly simple. Boy writes book. Boy looses book via a klepto nymphomaniac. Book becomes popular. Boy meets nympho. Really & truthfully, I can't put my finger on any one thing that really made this movie into a 3 star rating for me. The plot was ok. The acting was ok enough. It's just that when you get down to it, the movie really wasn't all that funny & when you're trying to pass yourself off as a cutesy college sex comedy, the laughs are important.It's interesting to see how many stars of teen comedies were in this film, though. I guess in the end, the movie's big flaw was that it just tried too hard. It had the potential to be better than what it was, but the film was just lackluster. It's not an abomination, but I wouldn't see making this into anything other than a movie rental or something to watch if it's on tv.",3,It's ok...,1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,1140,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'film', 'alone', 'got', 'film', ""'d"", 'actually', 'expected', 'film', 'be', 'funny', 'good', ""'d"", 'have', 'turned', 'off', 'halfway', 'flick', 'tries', 'really', 'really', 'hard', 'be', 'lot', 'things', 'end', 'got', 'bogged', 'down', 'own', 'weight.The', 'plot', 'incredibly', 'simple', 'Boy', 'book', 'Boy', 'book', 'klepto', 'nymphomaniac', 'Book', 'popular', 'Boy', 'nympho', 'Really', 'truthfully', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'made', 'movie', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'plot', 'was', 'ok', 'acting', 'was', 'ok', 'enough', 'just', 'when', 'get', 'down', 'movie', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'cutesy', 'college', 'sex', 'comedy', 'laughs', 'are', 'important.It', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'stars', 'teen', 'comedies', 'were', 'film', 'guess', 'end', 'movie', 'big', 'flaw', 'was', 'just', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'better', 'what', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'lackluster', 'not', 'abomination', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'making', 'anything', 'other', 'movie', 'rental', 'something', 'watch', 'tv']",Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas
1070751,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000PFUAQ4,Jason,"[11, 12]","Patrick Fugit is Bickford Schmeckler, a loner who lives in the basement of a busy frat house, writing down his ""cool ideas"" in a large metal book. Olivia Wilde is the beautiful (and smart) girl who throws his world into a tailspin by stealing it from his room. When further mischief gets his book published and distributed around campus, Bickford must come to terms with his own behavior, and decide whether to live his ideas or keep them locked away in his book.Of course, the hot chick and nerd hook up.  He won't stop acting like an emo kid and she dumps him.  They get back together, kiss kiss, make-up garbage.  And to think, all he had to do was write a ""sex poem"".This film is for the most part, funny and light-hearted. Director Scott Lew packs a lot of typical college humor in (party mishaps, D&D; geeks who hang out in a comic shop - one of which is John Cho from Harold & Kumar!, etc.), but it all works -- I even found the bits with Matthew Lillard as a campus misfit named ""Spaceman"" enjoyable. Where it goes slightly awry is when it tries to introduce some seriousness in the form of why Bickford is so socially-challenged. Adding in emotional conflicts seemed to halt the story and put too dark a slant on the intent. The director was suffering from ALS when the movie was being made.I did like the made up word ""braingasm""....the dorky D&D; kids in this sadly reminded me of some of my AP classes in high school.Still, Fugit pulls it all off with his sideways smile and adorable quirkiness (although, I am starting to wonder if he falls down in every movie on purpose, or if he's just clumsy). So, if you're in the mood for something cute, funny, and light, Bickford is good for a once-over. It will make you laugh, and it's worth watching just to see Fugit do what he does best.What I found amusing most of all was the legion of followers he gains from just being crazy and writing random things down in ""The Book"".One more added note: Bickford had the BEST t-shirts ever.",4,Braingasm,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,1990,"['Patrick', 'Fugit', 'Bickford', 'Schmeckler', 'loner', 'who', 'basement', 'busy', 'frat', 'house', 'writing', 'down', 'cool', 'ideas', 'large', 'metal', 'book', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'beautiful', 'smart', 'girl', 'who', 'world', 'tailspin', 'stealing', 'room', 'When', 'further', 'mischief', 'book', 'published', 'distributed', 'campus', 'Bickford', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'own', 'behavior', 'decide', 'live', 'ideas', 'keep', 'locked', 'away', 'book.Of', 'course', 'hot', 'chick', 'nerd', 'hook', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'acting', 'emo', 'kid', 'dumps', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'kiss', 'kiss', 'make-up', 'garbage', 'think', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'write', 'sex', 'poem', '.This', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'funny', 'light-hearted', 'Director', 'Scott', 'Lew', 'lot', 'typical', 'college', 'humor', 'party', 'mishaps', 'D', 'D', 'geeks', 'who', 'hang', 'out', 'comic', 'shop', 'one', 'John', 'Cho', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'etc', 'even', 'found', 'bits', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'campus', 'misfit', 'named', 'Spaceman', 'enjoyable', 'Where', 'slightly', 'awry', 'when', 'introduce', 'seriousness', 'form', 'why', 'Bickford', 'so', 'socially-challenged', 'Adding', 'emotional', 'conflicts', 'seemed', 'halt', 'story', 'put', 'too', 'dark', 'slant', 'intent', 'director', 'was', 'suffering', 'ALS', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'made.I', 'did', 'made', 'up', 'word', 'braingasm', 'dorky', 'D', 'D', 'kids', 'sadly', 'reminded', 'AP', 'classes', 'high', 'school.Still', 'Fugit', 'off', 'sideways', 'smile', 'adorable', 'quirkiness', 'am', 'starting', 'wonder', 'down', 'movie', 'purpose', 'just', 'clumsy', 'So', ""'re"", 'mood', 'something', 'cute', 'funny', 'light', 'Bickford', 'good', 'once-over', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'see', 'Fugit', 'do', 'what', 'found', 'amusing', 'most', 'was', 'legion', 'followers', 'gains', 'just', 'being', 'crazy', 'writing', 'random', 'things', 'down', 'Book', 'more', 'added', 'note', 'Bickford', 'had', 'BEST', 't-shirts', 'ever']",Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas

It's standing on a mountaintop, letting the wind whip through your hair as you fill your lungs.Bickford Shmeckler is the epitome of an introvert. He lives secluded from his housemates in a basement bedroom and devotes all his time to The Book, where he pours out all of his genius ideas. During a fateful toga party, a seductive blonde artist named Sarah finds The Book, and upon being mentally blown away by Bick's wonderings, steals it to finish reading. She then passes it on to a friend, and it is continually passed on until the entire campus is reading it, experiencing pleasurable ""braingasms"" while reading. Bickford doesn't take too kindly to his Book going missing, and even less kindly when he finds that The Book is being distributed campus wide. He ropes Sarah into helping him get it back as she was the one who stole it, and along the way he encounters several colorful characters who have also been affected by The Book, whether for the better or worse.I may be biased as a fan of Patrick Fugit's acting, but personally I'd love to hand out a copy of this to absolutely everyone in my life.

1070753,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000PFUAQ4,Richard Ross,"[3, 7]","Bickford Schmeckler (Fugit) is a shy genius who spends all of his time compiling his wisdom in a large book. Since he lives in the basement of a noisy frat house he doesn't have many quiet moments of solitude. Rarely does Bickford go upstairs and talk to anybody. He thinks they are all inferior to him anyhow. One night his curiosity gets the better of him and he ventures upstairs. Bickford meets Sarah (Wilde) an extremely hot sorority sister. She is stoned and flirtatious and Bickford grows bored with her quickly. After he leaves she goes down to his room and discovers the book. She starts paging through it and experiences some kind of orgasm. She steals the book since it had that kind of effect on her. When Bickford discovers this he tells anyone who will listen that he has been raped. Emotionally raped that is. He tries to track Sarah down only to discover that she no longer has the book. She shared it with her musician boyfriend who threw it in the trash. A homeless schizophrenic (Matthew Lillard) who hears aliens is the next to pick it up. After he reads a few pages he comes to the conclusion that Bickford can help him.  He won't give Bickford the book until he helps him defeat the aliens. The book winds up in the hands of a Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast (John Cho). He quits the game so he can make photocopies and distribute it on campus. One of Bickford's professors (Cheryl Hines) is the last person to whom the book passes. She's so impressed that one of her students could write something like this she contacts a publisher (Clark Gregg) who offers Bickford a large amount of money for his Cool Ideas. While Bickford grapples with the notion of selling out we learn the causes of what made him this way. It's all a bit like ""Garden State"". Bickford had a sick mom, is severely depressed and removed, and all it takes is a good looking gal to snap him out of it and get him to start living again.  The film is too quick at eighty odd minutes to leave any lasting impressions but Patrick Fugit is the ideal leading man and Olivia Wilde is so damn hot that you don't doubt for a second that she could get Bickford excited.
