1161159,A1JHQT5ZS4JDCC,B00191AEYQ,Alex,"[1, 2]","I saw one episode of this show several years ago and captivated me immediately. I liked the plot and the performances so I kept watching the series and I was upset when they canceled it.The series shows the history of Tru Davies (eliza dushku), a common girl who gets a job at the morgue and in addition to fulfilling their normal work, has the peculiar task of saving the lives of the bodies upon request. Once a corpse appears, and asks for help, Tru's Day restarts , giving her the opportunity to change the events that led to the death of that person.The secondary characters play their role exceptionally, and add a dose of humor and drama that keeps the show entertaining.The role of the villain, is well structured, in my opinion, and adds that element of mystery and at times makes us question the work of Tru.The plot may sound repetitive and silly to some, but the way it is written, makes them interesting stories that keep the viewer wanting more.The second season has an arc that would completely shake up the series. Unfortunately, we were left with the desire to see what happened.We were fortunate that FOX decided to release a version of the complete series on DVD at a no reasonable price, if you consider the the number of discs and episodes. I lasted a long time deciding whether to buy the series, since they sold it in two sets, one per season.These kind of shows makes you wonder what kind of people work in those networks , that can't realize the pottential of a particular show.If you're a fan of TRU CALLING, this is the set you should buy and if you're not, you will definitely become one.",5,Fantastic show that didn't have a chance!,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,1616,"['saw', 'one', 'episode', 'show', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'captivated', 'immediately', 'liked', 'plot', 'performances', 'so', 'kept', 'watching', 'series', 'was', 'upset', 'when', 'canceled', 'it.The', 'series', 'history', 'Tru', 'Davies', 'eliza', 'dushku', 'common', 'girl', 'who', 'job', 'morgue', 'addition', 'fulfilling', 'normal', 'work', 'peculiar', 'task', 'saving', 'lives', 'bodies', 'request', 'Once', 'corpse', 'help', 'Tru', 'Day', 'giving', 'opportunity', 'change', 'events', 'led', 'death', 'person.The', 'secondary', 'characters', 'play', 'role', 'exceptionally', 'add', 'dose', 'humor', 'drama', 'show', 'entertaining.The', 'role', 'villain', 'well', 'structured', 'opinion', 'element', 'mystery', 'times', 'question', 'work', 'Tru.The', 'plot', 'may', 'sound', 'repetitive', 'silly', 'way', 'written', 'interesting', 'stories', 'keep', 'viewer', 'wanting', 'more.The', 'second', 'season', 'arc', 'would', 'completely', 'shake', 'up', 'series', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'left', 'desire', 'see', 'what', 'happened.We', 'were', 'fortunate', 'FOX', 'decided', 'release', 'version', 'complete', 'series', 'DVD', 'reasonable', 'price', 'consider', 'number', 'discs', 'episodes', 'lasted', 'long', 'time', 'deciding', 'buy', 'series', 'sold', 'two', 'sets', 'one', 'season.These', 'kind', 'shows', 'wonder', 'what', 'kind', 'people', 'work', 'networks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'realize', 'pottential', 'particular', 'show.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'TRU', 'CALLING', 'set', 'should', 'buy', ""'re"", 'not', 'will', 'definitely', 'become', 'one']",Tru Calling Complete Series

I bought it for the main reasons that it was on sale when I got it, and that Joss Whedon really liked the show, and of course Eliza is very pretty, but I tend to shy away from shows because of the eye candy, and after tolerating dollhouse, I was really skeptical on her ability to carry a show with less tallented people behind the camera than would be present for Joss, and I have to tell you that though the premise is almost generic, and the scale much smaller than doll house, the execution if far better pulled off.  It manages to have a lot of attention to detail which keeps your mind working, which is really cool for a kind of show that focuses on the changes the main character makes by living the second day twice.  I agree with many of the other reviewers in saying that the plot twist half way through with having her nemesis, who tries to not have anything change.  Where it appears to Tru that he is out to kill people, to her enemy, they are already dead, and might eventually change things for the worse, and everything happens for a reason, and uses many of the same tricks that she does, and though he definately crosses a line in the season 1 finale, but i think if the show had gone on any longer that it would have become more and more ambiguous.

The dead bodies that come into the morgue asks Tru for her help so she relives the days to try and help them survive. She has to go back and try to find clues as to who is trying to kill the people or how the wreck happens so she can prevent it from happening. After a few episodes Tru starts telling people that she helps the dead including her Brother Harrison and the morgue worker Davis and they help her solve the cases. Towards the end of the first season a guy name Jack comes in and there is conflict between Tru and Jack because she tries to save the souls and Jack tries to prevent her from doing her job.This was a truly remarkable show.

Well, at least it fared better thanFirefly.  Sorry, it still hurts.  The show starred girl-of-my-dreams Eliza Dushku (ofBuffy/Angelfame) as a morgue attendant, Tru Davies, who gains a unique supernatural power.  The dead bodies she attends occasionally ask her for help and she finds herself instantly transported back to the moment she awoke that morning and charged with saving the life of the corpse she just encountered.  It's a simple set-up for what proves to be a formulaic but very entertaining show that deserved much better than it got.Honestly, Eliza Dushku herself is reason enough to go out and buy this.  The girl is just a joy to watch onscreen.  She has girl-next-door likability, great acting talent, plenty of attitude, and a damn sexy voice. Also: quite pretty, yes?  But the writing for ""Tru Calling"" is also top-notch and manages to keep things interesting at all times in spite of the episodic nature of the stories.  You'll be surprised at how inventive and compelling some of the stories are.  One finds Tru reliving the same day four separate times as every night after saving the life, another corpse turns up as a result and sends her back to the start.  Others have her juggling her duty with finagling her ne'er-do-well of a brother out of whatever idiotic situation he's gotten himself into or attempting to save people close to her. Yet another has her charged with saving two lives on the same day, a monumental task considering the amount of investigation, resourcefulness, and work it takes to save the life of one person you don't know anything about aside from cause of death.  The supporting cast is also outstanding including Tru's boss (aThe Lord of the Ringsnerd), and her exceptionally dysfunctional family. Just how dysfunctional?  I couldn't possibly tell you without massive spoilers.The real story for the show begins when Tru finds out that she has an opposite.  Jason Priestly takes the show by storm as Jack, a man whose day rewinds every time our heroine's does and is charged with making sure those on a collision course with death stay that way.  Tru is then forced to examine her place in the world and wonder if she is, as Jack says, doing more harm than good by disrupting the natural order of things.  The come the bombshells.  The last part of Season 1 gathers massive momentum that carries over into Season 2 and you curse Fox's stupidity for killing yet another great show at it's creative peak when the last episode is done and you're left pondering what could have been.""Tru Calling"" was an outstanding series for fans of supernatural television and I'm still ticked off that it's gone.  Instead we got endless ""reality"" shows -each more inane and derivative than the last-, more and more formulaic crime and medical dramas (House, M.D.rocks, though), and fluff like ""Medium"" and ""Ghost Whisperer"" (no links for you!). And when we do get real deal supernatural television it's on-the-bubble shows like Reaper that are great and so you fear every week of hearing about their cancellation.  This is no kind of life for a fan to live, man!  Speak up about your favorite shows when those rumors start swirling.  One email to the network can be a drop in an ocean of support that saves the shows you love.
