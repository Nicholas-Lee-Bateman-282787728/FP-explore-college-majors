240121,A2SHF3F8N7HGS3,6300274586,"Allen Eaton ""aleaton3""","[216, 233]","Several of the reviews on this site ask the Disney studio to release this film on DVD.  Well, they have and this review refers to the DVD version.I have been familiar with this movie since I worked at the Disney studio in 16mm film distribution in the 1970s (about 7 years before the VHS blockbuster years began), and am familiar with the original negatives.  In what I am finding to be typical of the Disney folks, this film is presented in a 'full frame' version, rather than a WIDESCREEN version.  The film was shot for a 1:85x1 projected ratio (known as Academy Flat) which presents the picture in a slight retangular format.  However, a full frame, 4x3 video transfer of such a negative isn't all that bad, although it would have distinguised it from the normal VHS format.Also, I am very surprised that the Disney people didn't make an effort to 'clean up' the original negative, which contains a great amount of negative dirt and scratches.  The DVD does preserve the original look to the film (color and tint), but there has been so much technology invented to digitally reproduce an almost flawless image, that I am surprised it isn't been used.  It is one of trhe major reasons that people have switched to DVD.Also, look for a mistake in the original negative.  Just after the horses board the train, there are reddish, flash frames (possibly an overexposure to the camera original negative) which could easily have been removed digitally.A few &quot;extras&quot; would have been nice, such as behind-the-scenes material.  This stinginess is becomming something notorious with recent Disney DVD releases.  Walt Disney shot tons of background footage for every movie he made, and this is stored in the studio vaults.  I've seen it in 16mm, although it was shot on 35mm..  You can ignore the lack of a WIDESCREEN image if the DVD contained these precious extras.  Otherwise, it's just a transfer of the old VHS image.  What's the point of that?As far as Robert Taylor's performance, far from being 'wooden' (as one reviewer wrote) I agree with another reviewer who said that he was protraying a real man (who was also alive at the time and a hero in Europe), and the script and direction decided to present a truthful, realistic portrrait of him.  Don't forget that this movie, and many others (BALLERINA, HORSE WITHOUT A HEAD, ALMOST ANGELS) were shot in Europe after World War II.  They were made chiefly for a European theatrical audience and were intened for an American TV audience on THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF DISNEY.  So, you'll find a different style of acting and presentation: a bit slow for us, but perfect for their intended audience.",3,THE DVD VERSION,1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,2652,"['Several', 'reviews', 'site', 'Disney', 'studio', 'release', 'film', 'DVD', 'Well', 'have', 'review', 'DVD', 'version.I', 'have', 'been', 'familiar', 'movie', 'worked', 'Disney', 'studio', '16mm', 'film', 'distribution', '1970s', '7', 'years', 'VHS', 'blockbuster', 'years', 'began', 'am', 'familiar', 'original', 'negatives', 'what', 'am', 'finding', 'be', 'typical', 'Disney', 'folks', 'film', 'presented', ""'full"", 'frame', 'version', 'rather', 'WIDESCREEN', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '1:85x1', 'projected', 'ratio', 'known', 'Academy', 'Flat', 'picture', 'slight', 'retangular', 'format', 'However', 'full', 'frame', '4x3', 'video', 'transfer', 'such', 'negative', ""n't"", 'bad', 'would', 'have', 'distinguised', 'normal', 'VHS', 'format.Also', 'am', 'very', 'surprised', 'Disney', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'effort', ""'clean"", 'up', 'original', 'negative', 'great', 'amount', 'negative', 'dirt', 'scratches', 'DVD', 'preserve', 'original', 'look', 'film', 'color', 'tint', 'there', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'technology', 'invented', 'digitally', 'reproduce', 'almost', 'flawless', 'image', 'am', 'surprised', ""n't"", 'been', 'used', 'one', 'trhe', 'major', 'reasons', 'people', 'have', 'switched', 'DVD.Also', 'look', 'mistake', 'original', 'negative', 'Just', 'horses', 'board', 'train', 'are', 'reddish', 'flash', 'frames', 'possibly', 'overexposure', 'camera', 'original', 'negative', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'few', 'quot', 'quot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'such', 'behind-the-scenes', 'material', 'stinginess', 'becomming', 'something', 'notorious', 'recent', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'shot', 'tons', 'background', 'footage', 'movie', 'made', 'stored', 'studio', 'vaults', ""'ve"", 'seen', '16mm', 'was', 'shot', '35mm..', 'can', 'ignore', 'lack', 'WIDESCREEN', 'image', 'DVD', 'contained', 'precious', 'extras', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'transfer', 'old', 'VHS', 'image', 'What', 'point', 'As', 'far', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'performance', 'far', 'being', ""'wooden"", 'one', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'protraying', 'real', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'alive', 'time', 'hero', 'Europe', 'script', 'direction', 'decided', 'present', 'truthful', 'realistic', 'portrrait', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'movie', 'many', 'others', 'BALLERINA', 'HORSE', 'WITHOUT', 'A', 'HEAD', 'ALMOST', 'ANGELS', 'were', 'shot', 'Europe', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'were', 'made', 'chiefly', 'European', 'theatrical', 'audience', 'were', 'intened', 'American', 'TV', 'audience', 'THE', 'WONDERFUL', 'WORLD', 'OF', 'DISNEY', 'So', ""'ll"", 'find', 'different', 'style', 'acting', 'presentation', 'bit', 'slow', 'perfect', 'intended', 'audience']",Miracle of the White Stallions VHS

Even though it takes place during the war, there is no sense of impending doom or desperation.  There are but a few explosions, some scattered fires, and one battle sequence that concludes rapidly, only a hint that a war was taking place at that time.  Instead, they just talked about the occupation of surrounding countries and worried about their Lipizzaner stallions and mares.  It was a bit impersonal, not helped by a strangely lackluster performance by Robert Taylor (yes, he did look silly in that hat).  At least Curt Jurgens and Lilli Palmer took up the slack, giving the best performances of the lot.  Loved all the locations, a good supporting cast, and those fantastic horses performing a routine worthy of Busby Berkeley.

240143,A6GMEO3VRY51S,6300274586,microjoe,"[2, 2]","BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: This Disney Studios production was first released to theatres on March 29, 1963. It later aired on Walt Disney's `Wonderful World of Color' on NBC television as a two part episode on October 17 and 24, 1965. It re-aired on November 11 and 18, 1973. For the television airing it was re-edited  and renamed ""Flight of the White Stallions"". The screenplay was the first Disney project for 29 year old A.J. Carothers, base on the book ""The Dancing White Horses of Vienna"", by Colonel Alais Podhajsky. In fact, Mr. Disney sent Carothers on travel to Vienna to meet the Colonel and visit the school for research.  Walt believed in having a good story as the base of a film, so much so that some writers were allowed to produce or direct their screenplays. The first director hired for this film wanted to bring in a writer to change the script that Walt Disney had already approved.  As a result a new director was hired, Arthur Hiller. The writer Carothers stayed on several years with Disney to write other screenplays including ""Emil and the Detectives"", ""The Happiest Millionaire"", and ""Never a Dull Moment"". The first writer, from England, had been removed from the project when his draft included a characterization of American G.I.'s as  ""gum-chewing soldiers"" according to Harry Tytle's biography.  Walt and his wife had also traveled to Vienna and had a luncheon at the Spanish Riding School while being treated to a performance of the horses.The solid background musical score is by long-time Disney studio composer Paul Smith, who won an Academy Award  for his work on Pinocchio. Smith worked for the studio from 1934 to 1962, writing the music for most of the Disney True-Life Adventures and many of their short cartoons. He was nominated for his compositions for Cinderella, Song of the South, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Saludos Amigos, and The Three Caballeros. The famous composing duo, the Sherman Brothers, were asked by Walt Disney to create a German style song for the production, and so ""Just Say `Auf Widersehen' "" was born.  The film is 117 minutes in length in the theatrical edit version. Released on VHS in 1987, and DVD in 2004.STORY: During World War II, the Colonel Podhajsky (Robert Taylor) and his famous Spanish Riding School featuring white Lipizzaner horses in Vienna are threatened as the Nazis are moving in.
