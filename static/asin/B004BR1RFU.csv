1395490,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B004BR1RFU,Douglas M,"[0, 0]","The Jessie Matthews musicals of the thirties have at last become available.  Matthews won't appeal to everyone with her odd chipmunk smile and her ""posh"" accent but she was THE British Musical star of the thirties.  She could sing with range, dance from tap to semi-ballet and had a dry tense quality that added spice to her performances. This was no simpering ingenue.I think ""It's Love Again"" is her best film. The songs and dances are plentiful and excellent, the stand out being a stunning rhumba in a nightclub which defines art deco. Robert Young, brought over from MGM, brings American panache to his role as her leading man, far superior to the sappy English men who Matthews was usually saddled with.  Matthews wears some fantastic costumes too, as close to nude as possible.  The film is neatly directed by Victor Saville and the plot is a silly farce about a girl trying to break into show business but unable to do so because she is ""unknown.""  Journalist Young cooks up a scheme to have her become the famous socialite Mrs Smythe-Smythe and there is one hilarious scene when the double entrendres flow thick and fast with a Colonel of the old school.The print is OK but the photography lacks the clarity and crispness of the equivalent Hollywood product of the same period.  In all other ways, however, the production values are first rate.  The downside is that the DVD has no extras except some stills and is quite expensive.",3,The best of Matthews in a nothing package,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,1440,"['Jessie', 'Matthews', 'musicals', 'thirties', 'have', 'last', 'become', 'available', 'Matthews', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everyone', 'odd', 'chipmunk', 'smile', 'posh', 'accent', 'was', 'British', 'Musical', 'star', 'thirties', 'could', 'sing', 'range', 'dance', 'tap', 'semi-ballet', 'had', 'dry', 'tense', 'quality', 'added', 'spice', 'performances', 'was', 'simpering', 'ingenue.I', 'think', 'Love', 'Again', 'best', 'film', 'songs', 'dances', 'are', 'plentiful', 'excellent', 'stand', 'out', 'being', 'stunning', 'rhumba', 'nightclub', 'art', 'deco', 'Robert', 'Young', 'brought', 'over', 'MGM', 'American', 'panache', 'role', 'leading', 'man', 'far', 'superior', 'sappy', 'English', 'men', 'who', 'Matthews', 'was', 'usually', 'saddled', 'Matthews', 'fantastic', 'costumes', 'too', 'close', 'nude', 'possible', 'film', 'neatly', 'directed', 'Victor', 'Saville', 'plot', 'silly', 'farce', 'girl', 'trying', 'break', 'show', 'business', 'unable', 'do', 'so', 'unknown', 'Journalist', 'Young', 'up', 'scheme', 'have', 'become', 'famous', 'socialite', 'Mrs', 'Smythe-Smythe', 'one', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'when', 'double', 'entrendres', 'flow', 'thick', 'fast', 'Colonel', 'old', 'school.The', 'print', 'OK', 'photography', 'clarity', 'crispness', 'equivalent', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'same', 'period', 'other', 'ways', 'however', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'downside', 'DVD', 'extras', 'stills', 'quite', 'expensive']",N/A

Although the plot of this movie doesn't offer much, it's more than offset by Jessie Matthews' fabulous singing and dancing performances. The romantic leading man is a very young Robert Young, but Jessie's main dancing partner was Sonnie Hale who (in the fashion of Liza Minnelli) was also one of her husbands.Unfortunately, I must agree with the other reviewers about the poor quality print.

Amazon has a policy of combining reviews of ALL releases of a film title together. PLEASE sort the reviews by ""Newest First"" and looking at the DATE of the review. There are reviews of an earlier release of this film here and the ratings can be misleading. Now on the review of the 2013 release from VCI:I first discovered British comedienne/singer/dancer Jessie Matthews when I watched - and favorably reviewed - the 1930s film ""What a Girl!"" (the film that inspired Blake Edward's film - and later Broadway hit ""Victor/Victoria""). Matthews was a delight and I wanted to see more of her films. But a search showed that only one other film was available in the US and she made a bunch of them. What great news when I learned the independent DVD reissue label, VCI, was going to release EIGHT of her films this year!  I've reviewed them all here on Amazon and this one may be - by far - the best in entertainment and transfer.While some of the JM films have only one or two songs in them, this one is LOADED! There are five full musical numbers with Matthews singing AND dancing along with co-star Robert Young (""Father Knows Best""; ""Marcus Welby M.D. - who knew he could do these?). The final production number is on a HUGE set with a large audience.The plot is really beside the point but the dialogue is witty and sharp with some great ""zingers"". The film was made in 1938 in England and - while the Hayes code was in effect in the US, the UK film industry was a bit looser and so we see the charming Matthews in some pretty skimpy (or see-through) outfits and hear a few saucy lines of dialogue.The print (in 4:3 ratio) is one of the best of the Matthews releases so far. The sound is decent - though not exactly hi-fi. VCI has added English subtitles (though the accents are not hard to understand and you shouldn't need them). The transfer was apparently made by ITV for broadcast on TV in the UK.There is one bonus - a 2 1/2 -minute Photo Gallery set to music from the film.If you are not familiar with Matthews, this DVD is a GREAT place to start. Then move on to ""What a Girl!"" and the others.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"All Singing! All Dancing!
