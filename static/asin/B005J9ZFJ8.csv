1463133,A20IIR0422G3A5,B005J9ZFJ8,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[0, 0]","I just finished watching every season, from 1 to 15, over about 3 months, and I tread lightly to avoid any spoilers. But there are a few things to which I can attest which will not spoil anything, and which will make the prospect of buying everything at once a bit more comfortable.First, I was amazed at how well the series sustained it interest and variety over so many seasons. Unlike &#34;House&#34;, it is not centered on one character, and it  does not easily have an entire textbook full of diseases and mysteries on which it can base episodes. It cannot dwell on one or two cases an episode, at least not on a regular basis, while House gets into and out of one pickle after another. Lots of actors come and go, but continuity is maintained and the stories and characters carry you through.Second, the show is, or at least seems, totally realistic within the ER. I watched the first season (only one available) of &#34;St. Elsewhere&#34;, which had a critical rating at least as high as &#34;ER&#34;, and there seemed to be something a tad artificial about the relations between the senior and junior staff. Again, unlike &#34;St. Elsewhere&#34; and &#34;House&#34;, everything is as you would expect.Third, the thing which makes the first two work, is that the stories range from the youngest medical students to the members of the board of the hospital.Fourth is something which is only possible with a long running series. The characters develop. This is especially true of those who begin before the final third of the run (Seasons 11 - 15). We have the most fun, and the deepest tragedies, with John Carter, Kerry Weaver, Peter Benton, and Abby Lockhart. The first two were on for the greatest number of episodes, over eleven plus season.Fifth is the large number of guest starts, some appearing for almost a whole season, such as John Leguizamo and William H. Macy, and some appearing for just 1 - 3 episodes, like Alan Alda, James Woods, Red Buttons, and Bob Newhart.To be honest, I am not over fond of the episodes which go far afield, such as Africa or Afghanistan. There are more than enough exciting episodes and episodes which can take place simply in and around Chicago. It would have been impossible to make this premise work in a hospital in a small city. That was the point of making this a county hospital, which had to take any cases  that walked in the door. It also meant a very large police force and a large number of city run EMT ambulances, plus medical evacuation helicopter services.I am just a bit concerned with the way in which the show represents the way interns are trained. On the positive size, what interns do must be checked by residents and attendings. What residents do must be checked by attendings. But in the ER, things are so often so hectic that it's hard to see how all this checking is done on paper. Most of it is verbal. I'm also concerned about the way interns are taught. Nothing is systematic. It all depends on what comes in the door. It's the system of see one, do one, teach one. And it doesn't always work.Nevertheless, the realism works, and it's gripping. Sometimes even too gripping. A very good investment if you have not seen every season. Especially good if you have never seen an ER episode.I have never seen Grey's Anatomy or Chicago Hope, but compared to &#34;St. Elsewhere&#34; and &#34;House&#34;, &#34;ER&#34; has them both beat.",5,The whole ball of wax,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,3402,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'season', '1', '15', '3', 'months', 'tread', 'lightly', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'can', 'attest', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'will', 'make', 'prospect', 'buying', 'everything', 'once', 'bit', 'more', 'comfortable.First', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'well', 'series', 'sustained', 'interest', 'variety', 'so', 'many', 'seasons', 'Unlike', '34', 'House', '34', 'not', 'centered', 'one', 'character', 'not', 'easily', 'have', 'entire', 'textbook', 'full', 'diseases', 'mysteries', 'can', 'base', 'episodes', 'can', 'not', 'dwell', 'one', 'two', 'cases', 'episode', 'least', 'not', 'regular', 'basis', 'House', 'one', 'pickle', 'Lots', 'actors', 'come', 'go', 'continuity', 'maintained', 'stories', 'characters', 'carry', 'through.Second', 'show', 'least', 'totally', 'realistic', 'ER', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'one', 'available', '34', 'St.', 'Elsewhere', '34', 'had', 'critical', 'rating', 'least', 'as', 'high', '34', 'ER', '34', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'something', 'tad', 'artificial', 'relations', 'senior', 'junior', 'staff', 'Again', '34', 'St.', 'Elsewhere', '34', '34', 'House', '34', 'everything', 'would', 'expect.Third', 'thing', 'first', 'two', 'work', 'stories', 'range', 'youngest', 'medical', 'students', 'members', 'board', 'hospital.Fourth', 'something', 'only', 'possible', 'long', 'running', 'series', 'characters', 'develop', 'especially', 'true', 'who', 'begin', 'final', 'third', 'run', 'Seasons', '11', '15', 'have', 'most', 'fun', 'deepest', 'tragedies', 'John', 'Carter', 'Kerry', 'Weaver', 'Peter', 'Benton', 'Abby', 'Lockhart', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'greatest', 'number', 'episodes', 'eleven', 'season.Fifth', 'large', 'number', 'guest', 'starts', 'appearing', 'almost', 'whole', 'season', 'such', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'appearing', 'just', '1', '3', 'episodes', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'James', 'Woods', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'Bob', 'Newhart.To', 'be', 'honest', 'am', 'not', 'fond', 'episodes', 'go', 'far', 'afield', 'such', 'Africa', 'Afghanistan', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'simply', 'Chicago', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'make', 'premise', 'work', 'hospital', 'small', 'city', 'was', 'point', 'making', 'county', 'hospital', 'had', 'take', 'cases', 'walked', 'door', 'also', 'meant', 'very', 'large', 'police', 'force', 'large', 'number', 'city', 'run', 'EMT', 'ambulances', 'medical', 'evacuation', 'helicopter', 'services.I', 'am', 'just', 'bit', 'concerned', 'way', 'show', 'way', 'interns', 'are', 'trained', 'positive', 'size', 'what', 'do', 'must', 'be', 'checked', 'residents', 'attendings', 'What', 'residents', 'do', 'must', 'be', 'checked', 'attendings', 'ER', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'often', 'so', 'hectic', 'hard', 'see', 'how', 'checking', 'done', 'paper', 'Most', 'verbal', ""'m"", 'also', 'concerned', 'way', 'interns', 'are', 'taught', 'Nothing', 'systematic', 'what', 'door', 'system', 'see', 'one', 'do', 'one', 'one', ""n't"", 'always', 'work.Nevertheless', 'realism', 'gripping', 'Sometimes', 'even', 'too', 'gripping', 'very', 'good', 'investment', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'season', 'Especially', 'good', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'ER', 'episode.I', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'Chicago', 'Hope', 'compared', '34', 'St.', 'Elsewhere', '34', '34', 'House', '34', '34', 'ER', '34', 'beat']",ER:S01-15 (15pk/GFT/DVD)

I've been viewing season one and so far so good. I'd actually give the series 4.5/5 stars. The early seasons were best, but there was lots of turnover in characters over the years, starting with George Clooney once he realized he could have a bigger better career as a movie star.

1463140,A36P3STLP32XQD,B005J9ZFJ8,J. Y.,"[18, 21]","(I wrote the below almost 8 years ago)But a really good show!I can't say it was the gore, the drama, or the fact that I too was working in an ""ER"" but I started watching the show religiously during its airings from 9 to 11 on TNT. I used to work up at a level 1 trauma center in Chicago as an ED technician. I would work at night and thus have the mornings free to vegetate. I have been able to follow the show from the first season to what I believe is the sixth season (TNT cycles the episodes after it ends).I'll give you what I believe is the main reason why I am hooked to the show and then go on to bash what I think the show misportrays but what it ultimately inspires. Main reason- The show is about real characters. Drama, medical technical details aside, you get to heart of what makes ER a compelling medidrama- people with real issues, real flaws that work so tirelessly to help others. You feel for Nurse Hathaway or Dr. Greene. They aren't as one dimensional or as stereotypical as a sitcom character. You can identify with them as a protagonist but at the same time, dwell and anguish over their decisions and choices on the show.Some of the problems I have with the show are that of what makes the show compelling. A lot of medicine is not as engaging or as clear-cut as ER may make it seem. You see Doug, Carol, Mark, Benton work so tirelessly to help others. They're committed, dedicated, and passionate about their work. As a tech, working in a real ED, I found this lacking with a lot of residents and attendings. The reality is medicine at times has very few rewards, very few emotional peaks and ebs as ER would make you seem. There are very few thank yous, very few heart-agonizing moments. Sometimes, towards the end of a 12 hour shift, you feel numb to the work you've done.This is all to say I don't love what I do and what I'm going to get into (going to start med school this July). It's just ER is to medicine like Apprentice is to corporate business. The show's way too idealistic, overdramatic. But the point of a good show is not for it to be realistic which brings me in full circle to the main reason.A good show allows you to identify with its main characters, like Carol, Doug, Jeanie because they embody such heroic characteristics that you would want in yourself. The main characters are what you want out of doctors, PAs, nurses working in an ER. I wished doctors could all be a little more like Dr. Benton or Dr. Greene. I wish I too could work in a place like County Hospital, maybe starting as a lowly tech, working my way up the ladders. But that would be too unrealistic, idealistic of me.****Update- now as an Emergency medicine doctor working fulltimeIt's funny that I wrote this review so long ago. And looking back on it, I remember how I felt working in the ED. There were too few celebrations or wins and more if anything, losses- the miscarrying single mom or the alcoholic here for the 100+ plus time, or the diabetic with angina pain versus anxiety attack. But there were those moments, where I was part of a resuscitation as a tech; where there was a good outcome and we left the room, exhausted but happy that we prevailed. I still feel this way as an attending physician working in the ED.A lot of emergency medicine has changed in the past 10 years- the general public overutilizes the ED. there is overcrowding, patient boarding and waiting a room upstairs, and also our general population is aging and getting sicker. But I still am passionate about those moments when I can make a difference. I know when you are here in my ED, you're probably experiencing the worst day of your life and I'll do my best to comfort and care for you. I won't be as reckless as Dr. Doug Ross or as heroic as Dr. Carter but I will work my best to take care of you and get you thru that day.",5,"Unrealistic, Idealistic",1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,3830,"['wrote', 'below', 'almost', '8', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'good', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'gore', 'drama', 'fact', 'too', 'was', 'working', 'ER', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'religiously', 'airings', '9', '11', 'TNT', 'used', 'work', 'up', 'level', '1', 'trauma', 'center', 'Chicago', 'ED', 'technician', 'would', 'work', 'night', 'thus', 'have', 'mornings', 'free', 'vegetate', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'follow', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'what', 'believe', 'sixth', 'season', 'TNT', 'episodes', '.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'what', 'believe', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'am', 'hooked', 'show', 'then', 'go', 'bash', 'what', 'think', 'show', 'what', 'ultimately', 'Main', 'reason-', 'show', 'real', 'characters', 'Drama', 'medical', 'technical', 'details', 'aside', 'get', 'heart', 'what', 'ER', 'compelling', 'medidrama-', 'people', 'real', 'issues', 'real', 'flaws', 'work', 'so', 'tirelessly', 'help', 'others', 'feel', 'Nurse', 'Hathaway', 'Dr.', 'Greene', 'are', ""n't"", 'one', 'dimensional', 'as', 'stereotypical', 'sitcom', 'character', 'can', 'identify', 'protagonist', 'same', 'time', 'dwell', 'anguish', 'decisions', 'choices', 'show.Some', 'problems', 'have', 'show', 'are', 'what', 'show', 'compelling', 'lot', 'medicine', 'not', 'engaging', 'as', 'clear-cut', 'ER', 'may', 'make', 'seem', 'see', 'Doug', 'Carol', 'Mark', 'Benton', 'work', 'so', 'tirelessly', 'help', 'others', ""'re"", 'committed', 'dedicated', 'passionate', 'work', 'tech', 'working', 'real', 'ED', 'found', 'lacking', 'lot', 'residents', 'attendings', 'reality', 'medicine', 'times', 'very', 'few', 'rewards', 'very', 'few', 'emotional', 'peaks', 'ebs', 'ER', 'would', 'make', 'seem', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'thank', 'yous', 'very', 'few', 'heart-agonizing', 'moments', 'Sometimes', 'end', '12', 'hour', 'shift', 'feel', 'numb', 'work', ""'ve"", 'done.This', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'what', 'do', 'what', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'going', 'start', 'med', 'school', 'July', 'just', 'ER', 'medicine', 'Apprentice', 'corporate', 'business', 'show', 'way', 'too', 'idealistic', 'overdramatic', 'point', 'good', 'show', 'not', 'be', 'realistic', 'full', 'circle', 'main', 'reason.A', 'good', 'show', 'identify', 'main', 'characters', 'Carol', 'Doug', 'Jeanie', 'embody', 'such', 'heroic', 'characteristics', 'would', 'want', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'want', 'doctors', 'PAs', 'working', 'ER', 'wished', 'doctors', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'Dr.', 'Benton', 'Dr.', 'Greene', 'wish', 'too', 'could', 'work', 'place', 'County', 'Hospital', 'maybe', 'starting', 'lowly', 'tech', 'working', 'way', 'ladders', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'idealistic', '****Update-', 'now', 'Emergency', 'medicine', 'doctor', 'working', 'fulltimeIt', 'funny', 'wrote', 'review', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'looking', 'back', 'remember', 'how', 'felt', 'working', 'ED', 'were', 'too', 'few', 'celebrations', 'wins', 'more', 'anything', 'losses-', 'miscarrying', 'single', 'mom', 'alcoholic', 'here', '100+', 'time', 'diabetic', 'angina', 'pain', 'anxiety', 'attack', 'were', 'moments', 'where', 'was', 'part', 'resuscitation', 'tech', 'where', 'was', 'good', 'outcome', 'left', 'room', 'exhausted', 'happy', 'prevailed', 'still', 'feel', 'way', 'attending', 'physician', 'working', 'ED.A', 'lot', 'emergency', 'medicine', 'changed', 'past', '10', 'years-', 'general', 'public', 'ED', 'overcrowding', 'patient', 'boarding', 'waiting', 'room', 'upstairs', 'also', 'general', 'population', 'aging', 'getting', 'sicker', 'still', 'am', 'passionate', 'moments', 'when', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'know', 'when', 'are', 'here', 'ED', ""'re"", 'probably', 'experiencing', 'worst', 'day', 'life', ""'ll"", 'do', 'best', 'comfort', 'care', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'reckless', 'Dr.', 'Doug', 'Ross', 'as', 'heroic', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'will', 'work', 'best', 'take', 'care', 'get', 'thru', 'day']",ER:S01-15 (15pk/GFT/DVD)

1463143,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B005J9ZFJ8,Mike S.,"[61, 65]","Chances are if you are looking at this, you have some idea of what ER was.  I remember it as the ""it"" show that everyone had to watch when it first came out (it debuted my senior year of high school) because everyone talked about it the next day at work, school, and even on the radio.  It was a unique show that had an ensemble cast where there was no big star.  Clooney was not the mega star he would become because of the show and after he went to movies.  He was just a guy you may or may not have recognized from bit parts on sitcoms.  Anthony Edwards was most famous for his role as Goose in Top Gun.  I think that formula is what kept it on the air for 15 years, because as one person left, they were just replaced with another person who was not a mega star.  In fact many times, especially after the show became popular the guest stars and cameo appearances were by people more famous than the cast.  And, there are a lot of people who started out with story lines on the show that went on to become pretty big stars (Kirsten Dunst and Lucy Liu are just two examples).THE NEXT TWO PARAGRAPHS CONTAIN SPOILERS FROM THROUGHOUT THE SERIES SO BE WARNED....I look at ER as two different series.  One that lasted until the original cast left and the one that remained after that.  I watched it pretty consistently up until Anthony Edwards decided to leave the show.  Then I watched off and on up until the last season.  I am actually using the DVDs to fill in the things that I missed.  I personally think the perfect ending point for the show would have been when Greene was killed off, and sort of handing the lead to Carter.  I know the show was still getting decent ratings at that time, but that would have been the high point to end it and it would have never been accused as being a series that hung on too long.My favorite story lines tend to be from the first few years of the show.  Greene being assaulted, Carter and Lucy being stabbed (the subsequent episode ""All In The Family"" being one of the best in the entire series) and Carter's resulting addiction to drugs, and the story line that led to Clooney's exit from the show are the ones that stand out to me.  I also like how they worked in the original cast into the final season, through guest spots and the flash back episode for Anthony Edwards.  I also liked how they gave Noah Wyle a story line in the last season, so we could see the ending from Carter's perspective since it started following Carter as a medical student.If you have never seen ER, I cannot tell you whether you will like it or not, or if you will like it all the way through or not.  That is totally subjective.  I can tell you that in the early seasons especially it was well written, well acted, and different than most other shows on TV.  Like any show that goes 15 years it had some episodes and story lines that were not as good, but on the whole it was a very good show, and better than many shows during its run and since it has been off the air.",4,"Just a review of the series overall, not the packaging",1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,2995,"['Chances', 'are', 'are', 'looking', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'ER', 'was', 'remember', 'show', 'everyone', 'had', 'watch', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'debuted', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'everyone', 'talked', 'next', 'day', 'work', 'school', 'even', 'radio', 'was', 'unique', 'show', 'had', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'where', 'was', 'big', 'star', 'Clooney', 'was', 'not', 'mega', 'star', 'would', 'become', 'show', 'went', 'movies', 'was', 'just', 'guy', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'recognized', 'bit', 'parts', 'sitcoms', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'was', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'Goose', 'Top', 'Gun', 'think', 'formula', 'what', 'kept', 'air', '15', 'years', 'one', 'person', 'left', 'were', 'just', 'replaced', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'mega', 'star', 'fact', 'many', 'times', 'especially', 'show', 'became', 'popular', 'guest', 'stars', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'were', 'people', 'more', 'famous', 'cast', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'story', 'lines', 'show', 'went', 'become', 'pretty', 'big', 'stars', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'examples', '.THE', 'NEXT', 'TWO', 'PARAGRAPHS', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS', 'FROM', 'THROUGHOUT', 'THE', 'SERIES', 'SO', 'BE', 'WARNED', '.I', 'look', 'ER', 'two', 'different', 'series', 'One', 'lasted', 'original', 'cast', 'left', 'one', 'remained', 'watched', 'pretty', 'consistently', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'decided', 'leave', 'show', 'Then', 'watched', 'off', 'last', 'season', 'am', 'actually', 'using', 'DVDs', 'fill', 'things', 'missed', 'personally', 'think', 'perfect', 'ending', 'point', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'Greene', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'sort', 'handing', 'lead', 'Carter', 'know', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'getting', 'decent', 'ratings', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'point', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'accused', 'being', 'series', 'hung', 'too', 'long.My', 'favorite', 'story', 'lines', 'tend', 'be', 'first', 'few', 'years', 'show', 'Greene', 'being', 'assaulted', 'Carter', 'Lucy', 'being', 'stabbed', 'subsequent', 'episode', 'Family', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'entire', 'series', 'Carter', 'resulting', 'addiction', 'drugs', 'story', 'line', 'led', 'Clooney', 'exit', 'show', 'are', 'ones', 'stand', 'out', 'also', 'like', 'how', 'worked', 'original', 'cast', 'final', 'season', 'guest', 'spots', 'flash', 'back', 'episode', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'gave', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'story', 'line', 'last', 'season', 'could', 'see', 'ending', 'Carter', 'perspective', 'started', 'following', 'Carter', 'medical', 'student.If', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'ER', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'will', 'like', 'not', 'will', 'like', 'way', 'not', 'totally', 'subjective', 'can', 'tell', 'early', 'seasons', 'especially', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'different', 'most', 'other', 'shows', 'TV', 'show', '15', 'years', 'had', 'episodes', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'whole', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'better', 'many', 'shows', 'run', 'been', 'off', 'air']",ER:S01-15 (15pk/GFT/DVD)

Zollo ""&#34;the queen&#34;""","[0, 0]","If you're considering purchasing this set then its likely you have a better than working knowledge of the concept of the series, life, drama in a Chicago ER.I was a huge fan of the series initially (until children made 10:00 seem like 2am.) this set is a gift as I revisit the years I recall and discover those I missed.ER is about its characters and the medicine. The series didn't thrive because it choose to concentrate on one or the other, it was always a well balanced blend of both.Most surprising is how dateless ER is. The landlines, huge monitors, what seems like archaic medical equipment all fade into the background of the plot, the human drama of saving a life.Watching each character grow as they respond to these situations is fascinating stuff. Greene (Anthony Edwards) deals with being assaulted, (but the evolution of the assault is riveting) Dr. Ross (Clooney) is constantly bucking the system as is his erstwhile girlfriend Carol (Julianna Margulies.) Carter has turned out to be a revelation. He's the keystone. His mistakes and successes are impressive.The nightmarish attack on Lucy and Carter is powerful stuff.As I continue to watch through each season I'm jolted by how many storylines are similar to Gray's Anatomy. Visa Versa really. Plots: two patients impaled together, similar HIV plot strands, Dr/student affairs-- but ER handles them more deftly. (This from a GA fan)Gritty and potent, this is 'smart, intelligent, important' TV that addresses the medicine and the human reaction to it. It's enjoyable and memorable. While I think the original cast is the zenith, the flow is pretty flawless as the actors leave and new characters step in.As for issues others have mentioned about discs being damaged this set is in perfect condition.
