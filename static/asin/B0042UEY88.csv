You will not be disappointed. I waited for a long time for this play to become available again. So get yours soon.This play was very good and unbelievable, meaning there was so much reality in this play that this play will have you not knowing which way things will turn out. So many twist and turns.. New faces, scripture, God all through this play!Love first lady, and grandmother (mother Laster) was so real! We need the elders! What happen to the people that would step in when a marriage or soul was in trouble... You don't see much of this now days.You will be on the edge of your seat because there are so many unexpected things in this play.. Many many elements of surprise through out this play! You will also laugh as well as be inspired.I would love the sound track from this play as well.Just because you have unequally yoked relationships does not mean things can not be saved. This is a great lesson on unequally yoked relationships. And just because relationships look dead, does not mean you can not speak life to the dry bones!DVD came sealed and was not broken. Quality of the screen was good.This play shows strongholds, deliverance, mindsets, and the tricks of the enemy and how he plays with your mind.Don't let the bad reviews fool you. This play does not have as many modern settings like the current plays we see. However when you go back and look at the old plays they still have a blessed message and this play has a message that will bless you. Seek the message and don't let the enemy trick you into not watching this play.This play was on point and to the point. This is a much needed play in our current times of the status of marriages in all cultures, but especially in the African American culture.. you can and will learn a whole lot from this play, don't judge a play by its cover or stage settings.Each relationship in this play goes through challenges that are reality. This shows the solutions to those issues as well. The characters are great and do an excellent job. I want to see more plays like this on the same subject matter with the solutions because this is needed to save the marriages and relationships of today.. Too many give up and too many stand for nothing.The play is so deep and needs to be seen by couples who are thinking about marriage and ones who are married. This has great music.We are already watching this for a second time and will continue to watch this over and over again. This is clean truth that family and friends can watch together.. Start a save marriage and relationships campaign in your community.We all change, but we should not let those changes tear our marriages apart. Remember as the play shows prayer still works!Please make more plays like this.. They are needed. This should be required for all couples before and after marriage..., We invest in everything in this world, but where is our faith, and why don't we invest in marriage and our relationships? We believe in everything this world shows us, but do not believe in marriage or healthy relationships.Keep praying for all marriages and relationships to be restored to better than what they were.. The divorce rate in the African American community is too high. Lets change this.. we can do it if we try and stand for something..Buy one for yourself and buy more as gifts! From a married mother of more than four children.. stay prayed up, the enemy is always on his job, look at the attack on marriages and relationships at the start of 2013 and end of 2012.Thanks for making this play available! Thank you Abba for this play and your word.
