I was trying to find a fun video that emphasized more of a dancing approach with good music. I found it. It's an absolute delight to fire up this DVD and start workin' out with Richard Simmons. The music alone is enough to want to get my feet tapping and my body moving.I've had great fun following the DVD and attempting all the dance steps. Fortunately I work out at home so no one sees me miss a step or heading in the wrong direction. I was always directionally inept. :-)Positive Pointers:1)  Upbeat music with a live band.2)  Inspirational as Richard Simmons makes working out a positive experience.3)  Featuring the dancers at the end of the segment. Both naturally thin people, and people who lost weight, are included in this exercise video. At the end they are all given credit. It is very inspirational to see someone who has lost 100 pounds using Richard Simmon's work out plan.4)  Gentle work out that offers both a warm up and cool down session.Negative Pointers:1) I wish there was bit more explanation on how to perform a specific exercise. People who have never danced or attended an exercise class would benefit from more explanations on how to safely do some of the exercises shown.",5,"Workin' out is fun, fun, fun!",1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,1313,"[""'m"", 'back', 'trying', 'lose', 'pesky', 'pounds', 'are', 'creeping', 'back', 'lost', '50', 'pounds', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'fun', 'video', 'emphasized', 'more', 'dancing', 'approach', 'good', 'music', 'found', 'absolute', 'delight', 'fire', 'up', 'DVD', 'start', 'workin', 'out', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'music', 'alone', 'enough', 'want', 'get', 'feet', 'tapping', 'body', 'moving.I', ""'ve"", 'had', 'great', 'fun', 'following', 'DVD', 'attempting', 'dance', 'steps', 'Fortunately', 'work', 'out', 'home', 'so', 'no', 'one', 'miss', 'step', 'heading', 'wrong', 'direction', 'was', 'always', 'directionally', 'inept', 'Positive', 'Pointers:1', 'Upbeat', 'music', 'live', 'band.2', 'Inspirational', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'working', 'out', 'positive', 'experience.3', 'Featuring', 'dancers', 'end', 'segment', 'naturally', 'thin', 'people', 'people', 'who', 'lost', 'weight', 'are', 'included', 'exercise', 'video', 'end', 'are', 'given', 'credit', 'very', 'inspirational', 'see', 'someone', 'who', 'lost', '100', 'pounds', 'using', 'Richard', 'Simmon', 'work', 'out', 'plan.4', 'Gentle', 'work', 'out', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'session.Negative', 'Pointers:1', 'wish', 'there', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'explanation', 'how', 'perform', 'specific', 'exercise', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'danced', 'attended', 'exercise', 'class', 'would', 'benefit', 'more', 'explanations', 'how', 'safely', 'do', 'exercises', 'shown']",N/A

I guess she thought I would never use it. But, a few years ago I wanted to start exercising, and remembered how much I wanted it. Well, I bought it and I love it, just like I thought I would! This exercise video is meant for people who don't enjoy exercising that much, but love to listen, sing, and maybe even dance to old 1950s tunes. Really, when you start to play the music you want to get up and move with it (and the people in the video really do look like they're having fun!). I love it because most exercise videos focus on the exercise only (obviously!) so the music is usually dull. Problem is, if you don't like exercising, than you tend to get bored. Richard is great at getting around that. You don't feel like you're exercising, but dancing to some fun tunes. The steps are easy, but Richard doesn't give a lot of explanation or commentary, so it may take a few times to learn them, but once you have, you realize how easy they really are.The people in the video are all different shapes and sizes, so you know that if they can do it, you can too. They are not professional dancers and only a few are exercise trainers (mainly, I think, for motivation and to help everyone keep with the moves). They are all just real people who want to lose weight in a fun way! I would highly recommend this video for exercise beginners and for those who would like to start but can't find the motivation!This DVD comes with extra interviews and a round table discussion that are also worth listening to. They'll definitely inspire you to keep going.

I used to love it just for the party atmosphere (the streamers and balloons) and the music. I would watch it practically every day during my preschool years. Years later I dug the tape up again and actually exercised to it and it brought back a flood of memories. I was afraid it would get worn out so I ordered the DVD. I love how it has new interviews by Richard, and even by a few of the people who were in this video. And the picture and sound are restored for excellent quality! Sure it's not a really tough workout, but it actually gets you up and moving, with the upbeat music by the live band, and Richard Simmons' words of motivation. Some of my favorite songs on here are the faster ones in the middle--""It's My Party,"" ""Peggy Sue,"" ""Great Balls of Fire"" and ""Wipeout."" And there are no anorexic super-skinny twigs in spandex working out in this video--there are real people of all different shapes and sizes, in regular clothes. I may workout at the gym but this is fun if you want to do something a little easier, and maybe even lose a few pounds. You will not be disappointed!",5,Just as fun as it was when I was a child,1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,1369,"['When', 'was', 'little', 'boy', '3', '4', 'back', 'early', '90s', 'was', 'hottest', 'selling', 'exercise', 'video', 'market', 'Well', 'time', 'volume', 'two', 'volume', 'three', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'released', 'mom', 'bought', 'VHS', 'tape', 'also', 'other', '2', 'volumes', 'could', 'exercise', 'used', 'love', 'just', 'party', 'atmosphere', 'streamers', 'balloons', 'music', 'would', 'watch', 'practically', 'day', 'preschool', 'years', 'Years', 'later', 'dug', 'tape', 'up', 'again', 'actually', 'exercised', 'brought', 'back', 'flood', 'memories', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'get', 'worn', 'out', 'so', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'love', 'how', 'new', 'interviews', 'Richard', 'even', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'video', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'restored', 'excellent', 'quality', 'Sure', 'not', 'really', 'tough', 'workout', 'actually', 'up', 'moving', 'upbeat', 'music', 'live', 'band', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'words', 'motivation', 'favorite', 'songs', 'here', 'are', 'faster', 'ones', 'middle', 'My', 'Party', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Great', 'Balls', 'Fire', 'Wipeout', 'are', 'anorexic', 'super-skinny', 'twigs', 'spandex', 'working', 'out', 'video', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'different', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'regular', 'clothes', 'may', 'workout', 'gym', 'fun', 'want', 'do', 'something', 'little', 'easier', 'maybe', 'even', 'lose', 'few', 'pounds', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
