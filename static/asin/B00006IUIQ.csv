717257,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00006IUIQ,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[1, 1]","Good Rockin' Tonight is an American Masters series of award-winning primetime specials that examines our cultural artists. It is recognized as the best biographic programs to appear on television. This 2001 over 90 minutes is the legacy of Sun Records, the most recognizable record label in the world, the yellow sun. Sam Phillips, founder, attracted newcomers with that special Sun Sound.  The sound was unique, but the record company lasted 10 years struggling to compete with other regional music and big companies.The focus of the show is to listen to the chat and to hear perform, the old-timers from Sun Records, Sonny Burgess, Billy Lee Riley, J.D. Fontanta, Scotty Moore, etc. In those early days, these entertainers were not part of the name and face recognition given to Elvis, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis.So what you have here is newer entertainers who were influenced by the Sun Records sound and performing:Ben Folds Five - ""Honey Don't"" / Paul McCartney - ""That's All Right"" / Live - I Walk The Line""; Mark Knopfler - ""Rock and Roll Ruby""; Robert Plant & Jimmy Page - ""My Bucket's Got a Hole in It"" / Zacherro (Ital. Singer) - ""Who Will the Next Fool Be / Third Eye Blind - ""Cry Cry Cry"" - Matchbox Twenty - ""Lonely Weekend"" / Kid Rock & Howlin' Diablos / ""Drinkin' Wine Spo-dee-o-dee""You cannot screw with ""I Walk the Line"", and this group Live? did not do the song justice.  And Matchbox Twenty ""Lonely Weekend"" was so so.You will see some very short clips of the Sun's early recording artists, however, you will NOT see enough. These are the people who were there at the beginning, and many still alive at the time of production and we it would have been wonderful to hear more, either in old clips or performing for the production.  You will see a tiny picture of Roy Orbison??  What was that about.  These oldies but goodies have gathered with Sam Phillips to share memories, the early days, the hits and misses.  Their music still sounds great!Get the companion CDGood Rockin' Tonight -  The Legacy of Sun Records, for performances that were NOT aired in this special.  Why not?  What is seriously missing from the CD is the Charlie Rich cover by Zacherro ""Who Will The Next Fool Be""  That is a version to hear!  It was subbed by Sheryl Crow???  ... Rizzo",4,The Sun Sound!

717258,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00006IUIQ,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Howlin' Wolf, Roscoe Gordon, Rufus Jones and an assortment of black blues notables in the early days. Elvis, Carl Perkins, Johnnie Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis and an assortment of white rockabilly notables in the mid to late 1950's. What do they have in common? Well, one thing, and make that an important one thing, is that they passed through Mr. Sam Phillips' Sun Records recording studio in Memphis, Tennessee on the way to some kind of career. Amazing. With the possible exception of Chess Records in Chicago that moreover concentrated on the blues no other studio can claim so much as the catalyst for what became rock and roll in the mid- 1950's, the youth of the present writer and of his Generation of `68.The format here, as in most of the Public Broadcasting Station's American Masters series, is to have a generous round of ` talking heads' interspersed with some performances, in this case, to honor the 50th Anniversary of the founding of the Sun Records (1950). An added touch here is that some of the performances by the old Sun recording artists are covered by more recent performers like Paul McCartney and Kid Rock. The `talking heads' here also include many of the old Sun artists who did not attain the stardom of those mentioned in the first paragraph yet who nevertheless had some interesting things to say about the meaning of the Sun Record experience.  A recurring theme is that mainly it got them the hell off the farms and out of the fields, especially those damn cotton fields. And they had fun and got paid for it. How can you beat that?  My take on this is that they were good old boys who got more out of the Sun, if not financially then musically, than they had originally bargained for. And all of this trip down memory lane is presided over by the impresario himself, the late Sam Phillips.Along the way there are discussions, sometimes heated, about the roots of rock and roll- black blues or white country. That will never, ultimately, get resolved although I think the case for the blues gets stronger the more I see and read about the early 1950's and the shift of the blues from a country sound to a city sound. But that can be argued another day. What we have here is recollections, funny and bittersweet, by those who were either one-shot johnnies or were `put on the shelf' by one Sam Phillips. That is the kind of influence that he had for that one golden decade of the 1950's. Another nice touch here is that the one- shot johnnies not only get their `hit' covered by currently popular musicians but they get one last 15 minutes of fame by belting out their own classics. Who can forget Lonely Weekend or Rock and Roll Ruby after this retrospective to speak nothing of Good Rockin', Tonight.A note on sound- no, not of this American Masters production which like virtually all PBS productions is technically of high quality. No, I am referring here to the sound in Sun Studio. I do not believe in ghosts or other such things but tell me this. Why, for example, does Johnny Cash in his Sun Records days sound like god's own creation when on work from other recordings I can take him or leave him? And that goes for Elvis, Carl, Jerry Lee and the others as well. The gods and goddesses of rock and roll were smiling on that joint- thanks.",5,Rock The House,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,3278,"['Howlin', 'Wolf', 'Roscoe', 'Gordon', 'Rufus', 'Jones', 'assortment', 'black', 'blues', 'notables', 'early', 'days', 'Elvis', 'Carl', 'Perkins', 'Johnnie', 'Cash', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'assortment', 'white', 'rockabilly', 'notables', 'mid', 'late', '1950', 'What', 'do', 'have', 'common', 'Well', 'one', 'thing', 'make', 'important', 'one', 'thing', 'passed', 'Mr.', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'Sun', 'Records', 'recording', 'studio', 'Memphis', 'Tennessee', 'way', 'kind', 'career', 'Amazing', 'possible', 'exception', 'Chess', 'Records', 'Chicago', 'moreover', 'concentrated', 'blues', 'other', 'studio', 'can', 'claim', 'so', 'much', 'catalyst', 'what', 'became', 'rock', 'roll', 'mid-', '1950', 'youth', 'present', 'writer', 'Generation', '68.The', 'format', 'here', 'most', 'Public', 'Broadcasting', 'Station', 'American', 'Masters', 'series', 'have', 'generous', 'round', 'talking', 'heads', 'interspersed', 'performances', 'case', 'honor', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'founding', 'Sun', 'Records', '1950', 'added', 'touch', 'here', 'performances', 'old', 'Sun', 'recording', 'artists', 'are', 'covered', 'more', 'recent', 'performers', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Kid', 'Rock', 'talking', 'heads', 'here', 'also', 'include', 'many', 'old', 'Sun', 'artists', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'attain', 'stardom', 'mentioned', 'first', 'paragraph', 'yet', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'had', 'interesting', 'things', 'say', 'meaning', 'Sun', 'Record', 'experience', 'recurring', 'theme', 'mainly', 'got', 'hell', 'farms', 'fields', 'especially', 'damn', 'cotton', 'fields', 'had', 'fun', 'got', 'paid', 'How', 'can', 'beat', 'My', 'take', 'were', 'good', 'old', 'boys', 'who', 'got', 'more', 'Sun', 'not', 'financially', 'then', 'musically', 'had', 'originally', 'bargained', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'presided', 'impresario', 'late', 'Sam', 'Phillips.Along', 'way', 'are', 'discussions', 'sometimes', 'heated', 'roots', 'rock', 'roll-', 'black', 'blues', 'white', 'country', 'will', 'never', 'ultimately', 'get', 'resolved', 'think', 'case', 'blues', 'stronger', 'more', 'see', 'read', 'early', '1950', 'shift', 'blues', 'country', 'sound', 'city', 'sound', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'day', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'recollections', 'funny', 'bittersweet', 'who', 'were', 'either', 'one-shot', 'johnnies', 'were', 'put', 'shelf', 'one', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'kind', 'influence', 'had', 'one', 'golden', 'decade', '1950', 'nice', 'touch', 'here', 'one-', 'shot', 'johnnies', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'hit', 'covered', 'currently', 'popular', 'musicians', 'get', 'one', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'fame', 'belting', 'out', 'own', 'classics', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'Lonely', 'Weekend', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Ruby', 'retrospective', 'speak', 'nothing', 'Good', 'Rockin', 'Tonight.A', 'note', 'sound-', 'not', 'American', 'Masters', 'production', 'virtually', 'PBS', 'productions', 'technically', 'high', 'quality', 'No', 'am', 'referring', 'here', 'sound', 'Sun', 'Studio', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'ghosts', 'other', 'such', 'things', 'tell', 'Why', 'example', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Sun', 'Records', 'days', 'sound', 'god', 'own', 'creation', 'when', 'work', 'other', 'recordings', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'Elvis', 'Carl', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'others', 'well', 'gods', 'goddesses', 'rock', 'roll', 'were', 'smiling', 'joint-', 'thanks']",N/A

There's also a substantial amount of information in the film that may not be known to fans.  I've loved Sun music for many years but I did not know, until I saw it, that the label began as one that featured the blues.  Later, when country was the speciality, the background of the artists matched its stereotype as one of the guys said ""There wasn't a one of us who didn't pick cotton before playing music.""There's some great lines in this one like when Perkins says about Elvis, ""That's the prettiest man I've ever seen.""  The documentary, with guest appearances from Mark Knopfler, Led Zeppelin, and Paul McCartney, lets you know just how important Sun Records was to the world's musicians.  We see here as well that many modern ""artists"" can't hold up to the legends of Sun as when the band, Live, performs a cover of ""I Walk the Line."" You will have great difficulty refraining from laughing out loud.  Some songs don't need to be redone and Cash had more gravitas at age 10 then most performers today.Sam Phillips is interviewed extensively which is great because he's an important historical artifact...but he's also a little cracked.  How old is Phillips anyway?  He's got more dark hairs than a college freshman but had to be at least 70 when they filmed him. Regardless of his idiocyncries, it was worthwhile having him on the screen.

Seeing and hearing rock legends like Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins back in the 1950s was great and might make me buy this DVD. I also thought some of the tribute songs that a few performers did were excellent, too, and featured some unique takes on some of these rock 'n roll standards.My only annoyance was listening to Sam Phillips go on and on about what a great pioneer he was in the record business. This man is a real blow-hard, a man with an over-sized ego with run-on sentences about himself. Since this DVD is a tribute to Sun Records, however, Phillips is the key man since he began the company and ran it! His Sun Studios, in Memphis, Tenn., is still famous. This is the studio where those guys mentioned above, and others, got their start. Phillips. Still, less Sam and more singers would have made this documentary more appealing.In the meantime, I learned about Sonny Burgess, Billy Lee Riley and a few other ""cats"" from that era that never got publicized as they should but were almost as talented as the big stars.Burgess is still bitter over that, and expresses it a few times on the DVD, blasting Phillips. So, to the documentary's credit, both the good and bad of Phillips are presented.It was great to see Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana, two guys who played with Elvis in his early days. Paul McCartney, Mark Knopfler, Ben Folds, Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, Johnny Halladay, Zucchero, Third Blind Eye, Malcolm Yelvington and Kid Rock all pay their respects to the beginnings of rock and to Sun Records.

The documentary has way too much talk and discussion among the artists who appear, such as Rufus Thomas, Sam Phillips, Scotty Moore, Sonny Burgess and Billy Lee Riley, and not enough music. The songs are few and far between. Someone interrupts every one of the short clips of classic blues and rock and roll recordings, and most of the new performances are not very good. Some, such as Third Eye Blind, performing ""Cry, Cry,Cry"" and Live doing ""I Walk The Line"", are not bad in themselves, but the arrangements are so different from the originals, they are inappropriate for a tribute to Sun Records. There are a few performances I enjoyed, such as, McCartney doing ""That's Alright Mama"", Mark Knophler performing ""Rock and Roll Ruby"" and Zucchero with ""Who Will the Next Fool Be"". Jimmy Page and Robert Plant did a pretty good version of ""My Bucket's Got A Hole In It"". Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana perform with some of the artists. Perhaps the worst performance was Ben Folds Five with a version of ""Honey Don't"" which had a total lack of any emotion or soul.If you're looking to see lots of music, I think you'll be disappointed.

Being a rock n roller now myself for just over 40 years it was wonderful to see my old heroes from the 50`s. Malcolm Yelvington was there, Carl Mann, Narvel Felts,Sonny Burgess, Scotty Moore, Rufus Thomas,D.J.Fontana to name just a few. A big feature on Billy Lee Riley who correctly pointed out Sam Phillips dropped in favour of Jerry Lee. Billy Lee to me recorded some of the best tracks for Sun. My Gal is Red Hot & Flying Saucer Rock n Roll. If anyone out there has his e mail i would love to tell him so. Going back to Jerry Lee i felt more time could have been spent on him considering as the documentary pointed out his influence towards piano players. W. S Holland who i will regret the rest of my life i never spoke to. In the 80`s my wife and i attended a Johnny Cash concert in Doncaster.U.K. Johnny was late and W.S was pacing the floor worried where he was. He walked past me on several occasions and i regret i never spoke to him. Elvis was the one who opened the door and Carl , Johnny Cash and company passed through..Its wrong to believe rock n roll started their but it sure as hell was a big influence. The Sun never set over Memphis it just faded into history and what a history as this DVD proves..",5,A New Sun Rising,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,1337,"['mailbox', 'today', 'arrived', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'have', 'seen', 'evening', 'felt', 'i', 'had', 'write', 'review', 'Being', 'rock', 'n', 'roller', 'now', 'just', '40', 'years', 'was', 'wonderful', 'see', 'old', 'heroes', '50', 's', 'Malcolm', 'Yelvington', 'was', 'there', 'Carl', 'Mann', 'Narvel', 'Felts', 'Sonny', 'Burgess', 'Scotty', 'Moore', 'Rufus', 'Thomas', 'D.J.Fontana', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'big', 'feature', 'Billy', 'Lee', 'Riley', 'who', 'correctly', 'pointed', 'out', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'dropped', 'favour', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Billy', 'Lee', 'recorded', 'best', 'tracks', 'Sun', 'Gal', 'Red', 'Hot', 'Flying', 'Saucer', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'anyone', 'there', 'e', 'mail', 'i', 'would', 'love', 'tell', 'so', 'Going', 'back', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'felt', 'more', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'considering', 'documentary', 'pointed', 'out', 'influence', 'towards', 'piano', 'players', 'W.', 'S', 'Holland', 'who', 'i', 'will', 'regret', 'rest', 'life', 'i', 'never', 'spoke', '80', 's', 'wife', 'i', 'attended', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'concert', 'Doncaster.U.K', 'Johnny', 'was', 'late', 'W.S', 'was', 'pacing', 'floor', 'worried', 'where', 'was', 'walked', 'several', 'occasions', 'i', 'regret', 'i', 'never', 'spoke', 'Elvis', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'opened', 'door', 'Carl', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'company', 'passed', 'through..Its', 'wrong', 'believe', 'rock', 'roll', 'started', 'sure', 'hell', 'was', 'big', 'influence', 'Sun', 'never', 'set', 'over', 'Memphis', 'just', 'faded', 'history', 'what', 'history', 'DVD', 'proves..']",N/A

You can call it true although ""Rocket 88"" was recorded before Sun Records existed.This documentary gives a history of Sun Records intermingled with modern artists working on a special album of Sun Records material.  I really like the way the documentary was structured, in that it gives the history and has the special tributes to these specific artists shown around that moment.This film isn't as loaded with information as a book would be, but it gives the history from the points of views of the people who were there.  The only bummer for me is the fact that there is no mention of the Million Dollar Quartet, but that was a jam session, so mentioning that would be a waste of perfectly good time, when there are other more important aspects of Sun Records to mention.",5,Perfect,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,1074,"['Sun', 'Records', 'was', 'beginning', 'high-point', 'Elvis', 'career', 'personal', 'opinion', 'beginning', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'career', 'probably', 'high-point', 'studio', 'career', 'most', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'career', 'good', 'amount', 'Carl', 'Perkins', 'career', 'self-proclaimed', 'birthplace', 'rock', 'roll', 'can', 'call', 'true', 'Rocket', '88', 'was', 'recorded', 'Sun', 'Records', 'existed.This', 'documentary', 'history', 'Sun', 'Records', 'intermingled', 'modern', 'artists', 'working', 'special', 'album', 'Sun', 'Records', 'material', 'really', 'way', 'documentary', 'was', 'structured', 'history', 'special', 'tributes', 'specific', 'artists', 'shown', 'moment.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'loaded', 'information', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'history', 'points', 'views', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'only', 'bummer', 'fact', 'mention', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Quartet', 'was', 'jam', 'session', 'mentioning', 'would', 'be', 'waste', 'perfectly', 'good', 'time', 'when', 'are', 'other', 'more', 'important', 'aspects', 'Sun', 'Records', 'mention']",N/A

I'm a big fan of the music that came out of Sun Records, but oddly enough I really never read or watched much about the history of the legendary studio.  I knew the basic story, but was eager to learn a bit more.  Books have been written-which I will get to eventually-but a documentary was too good to pass up.Well, I learned basically doodly-squat from this 2 hour documentary.  The famous Sun artists are briefly introduced and talked about, but are whisked out of the film almost as quickly as they arrive.  I know most of these artists can(and do)have their own documentaries, but I would have expected a little more to be said about these people.  These people made Sun!  Aside from a brief photograph, Roy Orbison isn't even mentioned!On the good side, the film does devote a lot of time to Billy Lee Riley(RIP) and Sonny Burgess, two excellent artists who's promising careers got shafted.  It's nice to see them, listen to their stories, and even see them perform.Now for the down side.  At the time this film was being made, a Sun Records tribute album was being recorded, and it features more contemporary artists covering Sun songs.  A big chunk of this documentary comes across as a commercial for this album as it shows numerous musical numbers being done by modern bands(okay, Paul McCartney, Mark Knopfler, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page aren't exactly ""contemporary"", but many of the bands are).  This irritated the hell out of me.  Seeing the balls removed from raw, rockin' songs and(some of them)turned into whiny emo crap is frustrating and sad.  I had to have the FF button handy at all times, especially when Kid Rock came out rapping.  Kid Rock isn't qualified to be a custodian at Sun Records, let alone cover any of their songs.  It makes me wonder if half of these bands are truly Sun Records fans or just along for the ride coz they happen to like one or two Johnny Cash songs.Sorry if I sound bitter, but I am bitter.  If you happen to like these reworkings, that's all fine and dandy as they are obviously intended, not only as tributes, but to appeal to a younger generation as well.  But I don't see why your age should require a filter to process older music.  But I can't say that ALL of the performances were bad, coz they weren't.  In all fairness, there were some decent covers.  I would have much rather have seen classic performances by the original Sun artists is all.And of course the main player in this film is Sun founder Sam Phillips, and he's not at a loss for words.  He's portrayed as a pioneer but certainly not a saint as he screwed a few of his artists over.  He seems to think he's hot poop, but considering the legacy of Sun, it's easy to see why.I honestly can't recommend this if you're looking for a good documentary on the Sun story, as this is a very abridged version.  I don't claim to be an expert on Sun, but I'd hoped the film would have at least put me on the path.  Looks like I'll be searching out those books now.",2,"Sorry, The Rockin's Not So Good Tonight",1250294400,"08 15, 2009",2009,3141,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'writing', 'negative', 'reviews', 'things', 'am', 'gon', 'rain', 'parade', 'here', 'bit.I', 'was', 'excited', 'seeing', 'documentary', 'quite', 'excited', 'actually', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'music', 'came', 'Sun', 'Records', 'oddly', 'enough', 'really', 'never', 'read', 'watched', 'much', 'history', 'legendary', 'studio', 'knew', 'basic', 'story', 'was', 'eager', 'learn', 'bit', 'more', 'Books', 'have', 'been', 'written-which', 'will', 'get', 'eventually-but', 'documentary', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'pass', 'up.Well', 'learned', 'basically', 'doodly-squat', '2', 'hour', 'documentary', 'famous', 'Sun', 'artists', 'are', 'briefly', 'introduced', 'talked', 'are', 'whisked', 'film', 'almost', 'as', 'quickly', 'arrive', 'know', 'most', 'artists', 'can', 'do', 'have', 'own', 'documentaries', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'little', 'more', 'be', 'said', 'people', 'people', 'made', 'Sun', 'Aside', 'brief', 'photograph', 'Roy', 'Orbison', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'good', 'side', 'film', 'devote', 'lot', 'time', 'Billy', 'Lee', 'Riley', 'RIP', 'Sonny', 'Burgess', 'two', 'excellent', 'artists', 'who', 'promising', 'careers', 'got', 'shafted', 'nice', 'see', 'listen', 'stories', 'even', 'see', 'perform.Now', 'down', 'side', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'Sun', 'Records', 'tribute', 'album', 'was', 'being', 'recorded', 'more', 'contemporary', 'artists', 'covering', 'Sun', 'songs', 'big', 'chunk', 'documentary', 'across', 'commercial', 'album', 'numerous', 'musical', 'numbers', 'being', 'done', 'modern', 'bands', 'okay', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Mark', 'Knopfler', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'contemporary', 'many', 'bands', 'are', 'irritated', 'hell', 'Seeing', 'balls', 'removed', 'raw', 'rockin', 'songs', 'turned', 'whiny', 'emo', 'crap', 'frustrating', 'sad', 'had', 'have', 'FF', 'button', 'handy', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'Kid', 'Rock', 'came', 'out', 'rapping', 'Kid', 'Rock', ""n't"", 'qualified', 'be', 'custodian', 'Sun', 'Records', 'let', 'alone', 'cover', 'songs', 'wonder', 'half', 'bands', 'are', 'truly', 'Sun', 'Records', 'fans', 'just', 'ride', 'coz', 'happen', 'like', 'one', 'two', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'songs.Sorry', 'sound', 'bitter', 'am', 'bitter', 'happen', 'reworkings', 'fine', 'dandy', 'are', 'obviously', 'intended', 'not', 'only', 'tributes', 'appeal', 'younger', 'generation', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'age', 'should', 'require', 'filter', 'process', 'older', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'performances', 'were', 'bad', 'coz', 'were', ""n't"", 'fairness', 'were', 'decent', 'covers', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'classic', 'performances', 'original', 'Sun', 'artists', 'all.And', 'course', 'main', 'player', 'film', 'Sun', 'founder', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'not', 'loss', 'words', 'portrayed', 'pioneer', 'certainly', 'not', 'saint', 'screwed', 'few', 'artists', 'over', 'think', 'hot', 'poop', 'considering', 'legacy', 'Sun', 'easy', 'see', 'why.I', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'documentary', 'Sun', 'story', 'very', 'abridged', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'claim', 'be', 'expert', 'Sun', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'put', 'path', ""'ll"", 'be', 'searching', 'out', 'books', 'now']",N/A
