1526435,A1WVA7V02PQOY6,B007512RA8,Dad of Divas,"[1, 2]","Ever since this series started I was impressed with the message and the content that the show provided, as it encouraged kids to be active learners and this DVD was no different. While there was only one episode on this DVD, it followed a similar format to some of the shows that are on PBS, though it was extended (being 45 minutes long). I knew this going in so I was not surprised that there was not more on the DVD (though I would have loved more). The DVD itself was filled with some great music and I loved seeing the interaction between Sid and his Dad, as a positive relationship between father and son is always a good thing to see on television. All-in-all I was impressed with the DVD and will say that anyone that loves Sid the Science Kid will enjoy this. If you have never seen this series, you should as it teaches kids so much about the world around them, but also about friendship, self-esteem and individuality.",5,A Great Addition to the Series!,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,929,"['Ever', 'series', 'started', 'was', 'impressed', 'message', 'content', 'show', 'provided', 'encouraged', 'kids', 'be', 'active', 'learners', 'DVD', 'was', 'different', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'DVD', 'followed', 'similar', 'format', 'shows', 'are', 'PBS', 'was', 'extended', 'being', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'knew', 'going', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'was', 'not', 'more', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'more', 'DVD', 'was', 'filled', 'great', 'music', 'loved', 'seeing', 'interaction', 'Sid', 'Dad', 'positive', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'see', 'television', 'All-in-all', 'was', 'impressed', 'DVD', 'will', 'say', 'anyone', 'Sid', 'Science', 'Kid', 'will', 'enjoy', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'series', 'should', 'kids', 'so', 'much', 'world', 'also', 'friendship', 'self-esteem', 'individuality']",Sid The Science Kid: Sid's Backyard Camp Out

He's always the most energetic one and I feel like the other kids kind of laugh off everything he says. Most of the time his character annoys me a bit, but we see a different side of him in this episode when the poor kid is scared of the dark, he's afraid of leaving his toys behind, and we learn a lot about his parents by the fact that they let him bring multiple suite cases to an overnight camp out....oh, and its cute and my daughter loves it so much that I've had WAY too much time to over everything about it, lol",5,Poor Gerald,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,572,"['think', 'Gerald', 'kind', 'bum', 'rap', 'show', 'always', 'most', 'energetic', 'one', 'feel', 'other', 'kids', 'kind', 'laugh', 'everything', 'Most', 'time', 'character', 'bit', 'see', 'different', 'side', 'episode', 'when', 'poor', 'kid', 'scared', 'dark', 'afraid', 'leaving', 'toys', 'learn', 'lot', 'parents', 'fact', 'let', 'bring', 'multiple', 'suite', 'cases', 'overnight', 'camp', '.oh', 'cute', 'daughter', 'so', 'much', ""'ve"", 'had', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'everything', 'lol']",Sid The Science Kid: Sid's Backyard Camp Out
1526439,AEQQ148C4ERR4,B007512RA8,"Sara ""Sara""","[5, 6]","I purchased this DVD as a preorder because the subject of this Sid the Science Kid DVD seemed cute, and seasonally relevant.  The DVD information said it was 45 minutes long, so I assumed (wrongly) that there would be more than one episode of Sid the Science Kid on this DVD.There is only one episode, the backyard campout.  While this episode is very cute, calls upon familiar songs from other episodes, and got our child interested in camping in the backyard, it isn't really enough content to fill a DVD.  The other contents of this DVD are mostly previews for other shows like Chloe's Closet and Dive Olly Dive, and an additional Sid sing-along song.This episode is adorable, and my son clearly enjoys it, as evidenced by the constant singing of the ""Beautiful Trees"" song, but I wish this DVD had more content on it for the price.",4,"Cute episode, but too short for a DVD.",1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,835,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'preorder', 'subject', 'Sid', 'Science', 'Kid', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'cute', 'seasonally', 'relevant', 'DVD', 'information', 'said', 'was', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'assumed', 'wrongly', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'Sid', 'Science', 'Kid', 'DVD.There', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'backyard', 'campout', 'episode', 'very', 'cute', 'familiar', 'songs', 'other', 'episodes', 'got', 'child', 'interested', 'camping', 'backyard', ""n't"", 'really', 'enough', 'content', 'fill', 'DVD', 'other', 'contents', 'DVD', 'are', 'mostly', 'previews', 'other', 'shows', 'Chloe', 'Closet', 'Dive', 'Olly', 'Dive', 'additional', 'Sid', 'sing-along', 'song.This', 'episode', 'adorable', 'son', 'clearly', 'evidenced', 'constant', 'singing', 'Beautiful', 'Trees', 'song', 'wish', 'DVD', 'had', 'more', 'content', 'price']",Sid The Science Kid: Sid's Backyard Camp Out
