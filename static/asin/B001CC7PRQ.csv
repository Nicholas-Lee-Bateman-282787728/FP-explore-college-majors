1175605,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001CC7PRQ,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Don't be fooled by my 3 star rating.  I actually enjoyed Pathology.  My biggest complaint is that it didn't really have much in the way of suspense.  The killings would just sort of come out of nowhere with no real build-up to indicate a death was near.However, the writing is pretty darn clever to say the least.  A group of young pathologists are secretly killers who feel absolutely no remorse.  In fact, what they feel is just the opposite of remorse.  They totally enjoy killing.  They enjoy toying with the idea of murdering someone in cold blood.Of course you have to realize this storyline is completely fictional because of the way the gang was able to get away with murdering people time and time again without getting caught.Anyway, once a new guy (the main character) decides to join in and play this little game of killing people with the rest of the gang, the storyline then kicks in.  Yes you heard me right- it's actually a game these people are playing, and it involves murder.It gets pretty intense as far as the relentless way in which the murders are carried out, and the amount of blood is pretty high too.I like the way the story was written.  Obviously smarter people who specialize in understanding how people have died by analyzing their bodies will get more satisfaction out of this storyline than, say, someone like me (who doesn't really understand all that pathology terminology).But the film does a decent enough job keeping you guessing what's going to happen next, who's next on the ""to die"" list, and how everything will wrap up by the films conclusion.  Truly a good ending too.Sure, it could have used more in the way of actual suspense, but we can forgive that little fault because the writing is actually really intelligent and memorable.",3,good film,1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,1775,"['Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'Pathology', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'way', 'suspense', 'killings', 'would', 'just', 'sort', 'come', 'nowhere', 'real', 'build-up', 'indicate', 'death', 'was', 'near.However', 'writing', 'pretty', 'darn', 'clever', 'say', 'least', 'group', 'young', 'pathologists', 'are', 'secretly', 'killers', 'who', 'feel', 'absolutely', 'remorse', 'fact', 'what', 'feel', 'just', 'opposite', 'remorse', 'totally', 'enjoy', 'killing', 'enjoy', 'toying', 'idea', 'murdering', 'someone', 'cold', 'blood.Of', 'course', 'have', 'realize', 'storyline', 'completely', 'fictional', 'way', 'gang', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'murdering', 'people', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'getting', 'caught.Anyway', 'once', 'new', 'guy', 'main', 'character', 'join', 'play', 'little', 'game', 'killing', 'people', 'rest', 'gang', 'storyline', 'then', 'Yes', 'heard', 'right-', 'actually', 'game', 'people', 'are', 'playing', 'murder.It', 'pretty', 'intense', 'as', 'far', 'relentless', 'way', 'murders', 'are', 'carried', 'amount', 'blood', 'pretty', 'high', 'too.I', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'Obviously', 'smarter', 'people', 'who', 'specialize', 'understanding', 'how', 'people', 'have', 'died', 'analyzing', 'bodies', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'satisfaction', 'storyline', 'say', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'pathology', 'terminology', 'film', 'decent', 'enough', 'job', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'who', 'next', 'die', 'list', 'how', 'everything', 'will', 'wrap', 'up', 'films', 'conclusion', 'Truly', 'good', 'ending', 'too.Sure', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'way', 'actual', 'suspense', 'can', 'forgive', 'little', 'fault', 'writing', 'actually', 'really', 'intelligent', 'memorable']",N/A

1175607,A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B001CC7PRQ,"Brian Long ""Brian""","[13, 17]","Pathology follows the path of Peter Petrelli-I mean Dr. Ted Grey, a recent medical student who becomes involved in a homicidal game among his new peers at the penultimate pathology hospital in the country. Compounding this is his affair with one of his psychotic new coworkers while simultaneously juggling his relationship with his now long distance fiancee, as well as a budding drug addiction.The acting in this movies is good, and by good I mean very disturbing. Grey starts off as a genuinely good guy, and is seduced by the prospect of proving he can solve the perfect murder. He initially soothes his conscionce by only killing ""undesirables,"" a term which quickly loosens as the movie proceeds. He is also surrounded by people who, were there such a group in the medical industry, would send many screaming from the hospital. The interactions between the members drives home the creepiness of the film(The memory of two students playing catch with a human brain stands out in particular), though a few are so pushed to the back they might as well not be present.The movie lacks enough punch to be horror, and far, far too much to be a simple medical drama. It does manage to be very disturbing, though definitely not for its believability. The crimes are commited, and the police are rarely, if ever, involved. The characters have far too much with regards to luck and resources in committing the crimes, and theres not enough explanation of the vagaries of them.I would give this 3, or possibly two stars, but it manages to be what it appears, a slasher that is both incredibly unsettling, and contains enough good acting to be able to survive to credits.

1175608,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001CC7PRQ,Caleb Williams,"[7, 10]","I'm not crazy over Milo Ventimiglia's work and only know him from the show Heroes in his role as Peter Petrelli. He's good in that role but I still find him annoying with his raspy ""look how mysterious I am"" voice and his floppy bottom lip. I just can't take him seriously and although he does seem to be trying to branch into more prominant acting roles, he's still that annoying Peter Petrelli. Michael Watson who's the general catalyst of the whole movie I only know him for his short part in season 5 of House M.D. as the private investigator. I like him in that and generally like him all round, he would have suited the lead role much more than Milo, but there you have it.Pathology tells the story of Medical student Ted Grey (Ventimiglia) who's just graduated top of his class and has been accepted onto the most prestigious pathology program in the country. One of his fellow Pathologists Jake Gallo (Weston) indulges Grey in their extra-curricular activities which is to commit the perfect murder. This is the point where the movie gets interesting as it's not just a competition were creepy pathologists go killing, it turns into an orgy of sorts as part of the game. It involved death, disection, drugs and just wild and filthy sex. It gets into a bit of a creepy storyline that can hold your attention throughout so I guess that's a big plus. Throughout the murder games, Grey becomes acquainted with the fianc&eacute; of Gallo and this turns the movie into a whole different ball game.It starts off as one of those movies we see a lot of recently which generally seems to be of the ""gorno"" genre, but it turns into a genuine thriller/horror that becomes in some senses quite disturbing. It's a dark film with a relatively dark setting, with most of the craziness of the movie taking place in the dark autopsy room. On further reflection I guess Milo isn't as bad in the role as I originally thought, but there could have been a better choice. I would recommend this to those fans of the horror/thriller/""gorno"" genre but this may not be for everyone.",3,It's OK.,1227398400,"11 23, 2008",2008,2064,"[""'m"", 'not', 'crazy', 'Milo', 'Ventimiglia', 'work', 'only', 'know', 'show', 'Heroes', 'role', 'Peter', 'Petrelli', 'good', 'role', 'still', 'find', 'annoying', 'raspy', 'look', 'how', 'mysterious', 'am', 'voice', 'floppy', 'bottom', 'lip', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'branch', 'more', 'prominant', 'acting', 'roles', 'still', 'annoying', 'Peter', 'Petrelli', 'Michael', 'Watson', 'who', 'general', 'catalyst', 'whole', 'movie', 'only', 'know', 'short', 'part', 'season', '5', 'House', 'M.D', 'private', 'investigator', 'like', 'generally', 'round', 'would', 'have', 'suited', 'lead', 'role', 'much', 'more', 'Milo', 'there', 'have', 'it.Pathology', 'tells', 'story', 'Medical', 'student', 'Ted', 'Grey', 'Ventimiglia', 'who', 'just', 'graduated', 'top', 'class', 'been', 'accepted', 'most', 'prestigious', 'pathology', 'program', 'country', 'One', 'fellow', 'Pathologists', 'Jake', 'Gallo', 'Weston', 'Grey', 'extra-curricular', 'activities', 'commit', 'perfect', 'murder', 'point', 'where', 'movie', 'interesting', 'not', 'just', 'competition', 'were', 'creepy', 'pathologists', 'go', 'killing', 'orgy', 'sorts', 'part', 'game', 'involved', 'death', 'disection', 'drugs', 'just', 'wild', 'filthy', 'sex', 'bit', 'creepy', 'storyline', 'can', 'hold', 'attention', 'so', 'guess', 'big', 'plus', 'murder', 'games', 'Grey', 'acquainted', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Gallo', 'movie', 'whole', 'different', 'ball', 'game.It', 'off', 'one', 'movies', 'see', 'lot', 'recently', 'generally', 'be', 'gorno', 'genre', 'genuine', 'thriller/horror', 'senses', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'dark', 'film', 'relatively', 'dark', 'setting', 'most', 'craziness', 'movie', 'taking', 'place', 'dark', 'autopsy', 'room', 'further', 'reflection', 'guess', 'Milo', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'role', 'originally', 'thought', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'would', 'recommend', 'fans', 'horror/thriller/', 'gorno', 'genre', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone']",N/A
1175609,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001CC7PRQ,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 23]","""Pathology"" is advertised as a medical crime drama, but let's not kid ourselves--it's an honest to goodness gore-fest, about one baby step away from trashy, campy horror films like ""Re-Animator."" This film revels in its tastelessness, so much so that I think it prides itself on being just shy of unwatchable. To give you an idea of what I mean, let's examine the opening shots: through a camcorder, we see interns using cadavers to reenact the famous orgasm sequence from ""When Harry Met Sally."" Soon after, a student ruptures another cadaver's intestinal tract, and he's so repulsed by it that he vomits into the open body. You don't experience this level of badness everyday. Not even the disgusting ""Re-Animator"" went that far, and that's probably because its gore was nothing more than an inside joke, one we could easily laugh at.In the case of ""Pathology,"" the explicit gore loses all its campy appeal because of the unlikable main characters, whose perversions are so over the top that murder is tame in comparison. A few of the characters have loud, animalistic sex at the scene of the crime; others save it for the autopsy room, and it's there that one of the female leads involves acupuncture needles and a scalpel. This is the kind of material you want to laugh at, maybe even try to laugh at, but ultimately don't laugh at because you're far too distracted by how revolting it is. Then again, if you have high tolerance for the sight of dissected dead bodies, and if you see the humor in throwing an organ at someone in protest, then you just might get your money's worth out of this film. It would also help to have a super strong suspension of disbelief.The story proper begins when Dr. Ted Grey (Milo Ventimiglia) joins one of the nation's most prestigious pathology programs, led by Dr. Quentin Morris (John de Lancie). Rather than bonding with his fellow interns, he immediately makes enemies, most notably Dr. Jake Gallo (Michael Weston); when Morris tells Grey that Gallo worked abroad in a relief effort, he responds with one of the film's most unbelievable lines: ""A bleeding heart--I cut one in half this morning."" The friction between him and Grey is shared among the other interns, who see Grey as an intruder in their midst. Then one night, at the local bar, one of them asks, ""If you could murder anyone and get away with it, who would it be?"" Grey responds with superior scorn, believing that we kill people because we're no better than animals.This is when Gallo involves Grey in a game the interns all play. After one of them commits murder, the others must examine the body and determine the exact cause of death. Some of these deaths are creative; one man is given a can of liquid nitrogen to inhale while another is injected with a lethal dose of barbiturates while still in his hospital bed. I don't understand how they could get away with any of this, but never mind. The interns inspect the bodies after hours in a medical theater, and they enhance the experience by smoking a crack pipe and drinking. One of them--Juliette Bath (Lauren Lee Smith)--is a psychotic, sadomasochistic nymphomaniac who lets herself run wild during these meetings. She appears to be Gallo's girlfriend but willingly makes advances on anyone, man or woman.Naturally, she and Grey have been getting to know each other, and this is bad because Grey's loving fianc&eacute;e, Gwen (Alyssa Milano), is ready to move into the city with him, away from her father's luxurious estate. At this point, Grey understands that he somehow has to escape the game. But that won't be easy since Gallo, who's rapidly losing control, won't let Grey call a time out on the game; in his view, Grey is just as much a monster as he is, and as such, he should appreciate the work Gallo has been putting into his victims. Someone with Grey's qualifications should be able to determine the cause of death, even if it was very well executed (no pun intended).Does this sound like a movie you'd enjoy watching? I'm sure the actors had a lot of fun during the filming of ""Pathology"" because they got to play with stage blood and fake organs, and who wouldn't have fun doing that? But there does come a point when enough is enough. The filmmakers never saw that point coming; they kept going further and further, as if they wanted to make the audience suffer along with the characters. You watch this film feeling various degrees of shock, not the least of which is disgust at the gross-out visuals. There's also disbelief over how inappropriately over the top the story is, especially since it makes use of an original idea. This movie is not routinely bad--you don't care about the character development or the length or the pacing. It's bad at a new level, one that makes you wonder what will happen next since pretty much anything is possible in a story like this.I can't place this film in terms of finding an audience; crime drama-enthusiasts will hate it because it goes way too far, horror enthusiasts will hate it because it doesn't go far enough, and comic lovers will hate it because the sense of humor isn't relatable. It's really nothing more than a sickening piece of exploitation, like an underground film you dare yourself to watch and then feel dirty about afterwards. I've already made comparisons to ""Re-Animator,"" but that doesn't means it's on the same page with ""Pathology"": the former is about bringing the dead back to life; the latter is about murder and mental reversions. Which seems better suited for lingering shots of cadavers being split open with medical loppers? If I were you, I wouldn't choose ""Pathology"" as the answer.",1,Body of Evidence,1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,5637,"['Pathology', 'advertised', 'medical', 'crime', 'drama', 'let', 'not', 'kid',

Surprisingly well produced for such an ugly film with above average cast and great special effects. This twisted tale has some serious flaws, but I can not deny that this film stuck with me after watching it. It's a shame because with a little tweaking here and there this could have become a classic in the gore hound genre. Gore with a brain.... you don't hear that too often. This film doesn't have much brain and that is its biggest problem, that and it is a truly nasty unlikable film for most.A lot of the gore is visual autopsies, which can be gross, but because of the nature being medical it doesn't necessarily have to be truly disturbing. What is disturbing is the nature of the premise of this film and some of the murders which are brutal to say the least. There is a fair amount of nudity and sexual situations which is disturbing under the circumstances they are used in this film and I think with a little restraint here with better character development this film could have delivered a much bigger impact. I wish that the ""medical examiners"" acted more respectful of the dead while performing the autopsies as I think this would have made them all the more sinister when their true colors were revealed(think Hannibal Lector). Instead they just blast you with everything from the word go and it makes the film and the characters one dimensional.While it has its problems it does show a sense of style and has an ending that makes the ending in 'Hannibal' look like a children's fairy tale.

At first I thought it was just another slasher movie, but since she paid the bucks, I decided to give it a shot. It turned out a lot better than I thought.I know a lot of guys were going to watch this just to see Alyssa Milano naked, but if my memory serves me right, she refuses to do nude scenes, so what you are likely seeing is a body double. For me, I could care less about the nude scenes. I must admit though, they were used effectively (not just with MS Milano) to jump up the creep factor.There is a lot of gore in this movie, and in a way it was over the top, but at the same time, it was expected for a bunch of psychos (uh, I'm sorry, doctors) working in an autopsy suite. I was never quite sure why they were there, if they were supposed to become pathologists, or regular doctors doing an internship in the autopsy suite. Maybe I missed it, but I never heard why they were there, though it really didn't matter as it was just the premise for the film anyway.It reminded me, in a way, of Fight Club. Once you're in, you can't get out, and you can't talk about it.There is a predictably high body count, and plenty of gross-out scenes that would make any slasher aficionado proud.

Even in some of the worst movies ever made have a certain quality that makes them a pleasure in some way. None of this holds true with the release this week of PATHOLOGY.The film follows Dr. Ted Gray (Vilo Ventimiglia of TV's HEROES), a young up and coming resident now doing his time in the pathology lab. Leaving behind his fiancee Gwen (Alyssa Milano), he heads off to study. When he arrives he is greeted by the department head but sneered at by a group of elitist residents who think of themselves as the cream of the crop. Figuring out a cause of death on his first day does little to endear himself to them.The doctors seemingly attempt to make amends by inviting him for a night out, led by their ringleader Dr. Jake Gallo (Michael Weston). Instead Gray is lured into a nightmarish world created by these fellow residents who are filled to overflowing with God complex issues. The drunken/drug filled night ends at a low level apartment with an unsavory character who pimps on the side. Before anything can happen, Gray passes out.The next day when he returns to class, Gray finds the corpse of the man sitting on the table with the class attempting to dissertain what was the cause of death. It is after class that Gallo lets him in on their dirty little secret. The group takes turns playing ""the game"". Each one chooses an unsavory character who has evaded justice and does him in while the rest must attempt to figure out how the next day.Their side activities include not just killing off people they have no use for but nights of crack smoking, alcohol abusing and sexual encounters any and everywhere. And Gray falls into this group as if he were born there. In particular, Gray begins having close sexual ties with one member, Juliette Bath (Lauren Lee Smith).Things begin to escalate to outrageous proportions with Gray and the rest feeling no sense of remorse when it comes to their activities. On holiday, Gray reunites with his fiancee and talks with her father about his future. When she lets him know she is going back with him, he tells the group he wants out. But this is not an easy task.Feelings of jealousy professionally on the part of Gallo and relationship wise with Bath make for a terrifying mix. Add into that the rest of the group and you have a lethal combination. There appears to be only one way out and Gray is willing to take it, but at what cost?The major problem with this film is the fact that with the exception of Gray's fiancee, there is not one sympathetic character in the bunch. Ventimiglia's Dr. Gray seems dazed in almost every scene. It's as if he doesn't care even when he gets to the point that he should. Anti-heroes have been a staple in films for years but here even that type of character doesn't hold true. Gray is just another non-feeling person in a world filled with them. The fact that killing means nothing to any of these characters make them ones to revile, not hail as heroes even when they kill the dregs of society.The cat and mouse game played between Gray and Gallo would have made a great episode of a TV mystery show, but stretched out as it is here it wears thin. To fill in the void, plenty of sexual encounters between Gray and Bath are shown locating them anywhere from beds to examination tables with corpses located nearby.I had high hopes for this one when I first heard the concept. But with each moment, the lack of someone to believe in, to care about, to relate to disappeared and left me feeling empty. The worst we have to offer the world is highlighted here and to me there is little or no entertainment value in it. As a schlock film perhaps. But as a well made, high profile, major studio release?

Surprisingly well produced for such an ugly film with above average cast and great special effects. This twisted tale has some serious flaws, but I can not deny that this film stuck with me after watching it. It's a shame because with a little tweaking here and there this could have become a classic in the gore hound genre. Gore with a brain.... you don't hear that too often. This film doesn't have much brain and that is its biggest problem, that and it is a truly nasty unlikable film for most.A lot of the gore is visual autopsies, which can be gross, but because of the nature being medical it doesn't necessarily have to be truly disturbing. What is disturbing is the nature of the premise of this film and some of the murders which are brutal to say the least. There is a fair amount of nudity and sexual situations which is disturbing under the circumstances they are used in this film and I think with a little restraint here with better character development this film could have delivered a much bigger impact. I wish that the ""medical examiners"" acted more respectful of the dead while performing the autopsies as I think this would have made them all the more sinister when their true colors were revealed(think Hannibal Lector). Instead they just blast you with everything from the word go and it makes the film and the characters one dimensional.While it has its problems it does show a sense of style and has an ending that makes the ending in 'Hannibal' look like a children's fairy tale.

1175628,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001CC7PRQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Pathology (Marc Scholermann, 2008)It is not entirely correct to say that Pathology is an uncredited remake of Stefan Ruzowitzky's much-superior 2000 film Anatomie. There are enough differences between the two to keep the copyright lawyers at bay. But I will say that there was a time when I was watching Pathology where the two movies are so similar that I paused the movie, pulled up my spreadsheet, and searched it to see if I'd seen the movie before and just forgotten about it. I hadn't, except for when it was called Anatomie. Now, I don't want you to take that to mean that Pathology is a bad movie; it's a capable little thriller, albeit one that goes for the cheap thrill too often. Just the kind of turn-your-brain-off-and-enjoy movie that hits the spot now and again.Plot: Ted Grey (Stay Alive's Milo Ventimiglia) is a new med school student specializing in forensic pathology. While he may have gotten into his prestigious school thanks to his fiancee Gwen (Buying the Cow's Alyssa Milano)'s father being a higher-up muckety-muck there, he's no slouch when it comes to figuring out cause of death. He's good enough at it, in fact, that he catches the eye of Jake Gallo (State of Play's Michael Weston), a resident with a terrifying drug habit. But that's not Jake's only dark secret; he's also the unofficial head of a small cadre of fellow residents whose extracurricular activities include wild partying and murdering people in inventive ways to see if they can fool the other members of the group vis-a-vis cause of death. Despite his misgivings, the puzzles fascinate Ted, and soon he is drawn into the group.There's nothing here you won't see coming a mile away. But then, when pretty much everyone in your movie is a killer, it's tough to get away with making your bad guys not seem bad. It's fun. I thought it would have been just as fun without the drug-fueled orgies; your mileage may vary. But if you're looking for a serviceable thriller and some amusing causes of death, this one will be right up your alley. ** ",3,Cause of death: predictablity,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,2035,"['Pathology', 'Marc', 'Scholermann', '2008', 'not', 'entirely', 'correct', 'say', 'Pathology', 'uncredited', 'remake', 'Stefan', 'Ruzowitzky', 'much-superior', '2000', 'film', 'Anatomie', 'are', 'enough', 'differences', 'two', 'keep', 'copyright', 'lawyers', 'bay', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'Pathology', 'where', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'similar', 'paused', 'movie', 'pulled', 'up', 'spreadsheet', 'searched', 'see', ""'d"", 'seen', 'movie', 'just', 'forgotten', 'had', ""n't"", 'when', 'was', 'called', 'Anatomie', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'mean', 'Pathology', 'bad', 'movie', 'capable', 'little', 'thriller', 'one', 'cheap', 'thrill', 'too', 'often', 'Just', 'kind', 'turn-your-brain-off-and-enjoy', 'movie', 'spot', 'now', 'again.Plot', 'Ted', 'Grey', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'Milo', 'Ventimiglia', 'new', 'med', 'school', 'student', 'specializing', 'forensic', 'pathology', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'prestigious', 'school', 'thanks', 'fiancee', 'Gwen', 'Buying', 'Cow', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'father', 'being', 'higher-up', 'muckety-muck', 'there', 'slouch', 'when', 'figuring', 'out', 'cause', 'death', 'good', 'enough', 'fact', 'eye', 'Jake', 'Gallo', 'State', 'Play', 'Michael', 'Weston', 'resident', 'terrifying', 'drug', 'habit', 'not', 'Jake', 'only', 'dark', 'secret', 'also', 'unofficial', 'head', 'small', 'cadre', 'fellow', 'residents', 'extracurricular', 'activities', 'include', 'wild', 'partying', 'murdering', 'people', 'inventive', 'ways', 'see', 'can', 'fool', 'other', 'members', 'group', 'vis-a-vis', 'cause', 'death', 'misgivings', 'puzzles', 'fascinate', 'Ted', 'soon', 'drawn', 'group.There', 'nothing', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'then', 'when', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'movie', 'killer', 'tough', 'get', 'away', 'making', 'bad', 'guys', 'not', 'seem', 'bad', 'fun', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'fun', 'drug-fueled', 'orgies', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary', ""'re"", 'looking', 'serviceable', 'thriller', 'amusing', 'causes', 'death', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'alley', '**']",N/A

I think this movie tried to be an A-movie, and it just doesn't pull it off. It becomes a B movie by default because of the sex and gore.  But the film still had problems for me.The one really enjoyable aspect of the film was the way the students killed their victims.  Probably really enjoyable because I don't know medicine nor pathology, and I don't know how accurate they were, I just assumed so, and that's a perfect B movie point of enjoyment: to enjoy without analysis.But here are the problems.  I had no emotional bonding, good or bad, with any of the characters. I didn't care if they got caught, or what they did with each other, or their game. This is a bigger problem because I had no identification with the main character.Ted Grey (Milo Ventinmiglia) is brilliant and arrogant. Other than that, he has no personality.  Why does he start hanging out with the baddie residents? Was he always bad deep down?  Did fellow resident Dr. Gallo touch a nerve and caused the change?  And what explains his actions at the end?  I know what the movie wants me to think, but because Grey has no personality to begin with, he has nothing to change back to, and thus, the conclusion is lacking.The supporting characters were emotionally detached from each other. In fact, I don't think any of the characters liked each other. I think this was what the movie intended, and if so, good job. However, the characters' emotional detachment to each other doesn't mean they should be emotionally detached from the viewer.The plot was really annoying because it wasn't a B-movie plot. B-movie plots are straight forward.  Throughout this movie, I kept asking, ""Is there more?"" And more didn't come.If thinking weren't involved, it would be a pretty good movie. It tries to have a suspensful plot, but it doesn't. It tries to have some character examination and development, but it doesn't.

1175634,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001CC7PRQ,trebe,"[4, 5]","A medical horror thriller that revels in huge egos and the methodology of murder, Pathology (2008) is a stylish, sexually charged drama featuring some nasty autopsies, examining the aftermath of some creative kills.  Realism isn't a major factor, as a group of medical students engage in a game where the goal is to commit homicide in an undetectable mannerMed school grad Teddy Grey (Milo Ventimiglia) joins the pathology program at Metropolitan University Medical Center and encounters a group stuck up medical students led by Dr. Jake Gallow (Michael Weston) who aren't particularly welcoming.  Gallow is an arrogant prick, and rising to the group's challenge, a confident Grey manages to impress with his knowledge of forensics.  Becoming involved with the group, Grey soon discovers that their idea of fun is for members to take turns killing people, and for the rest of the group to figure out how the deed was done.  These macabre thrills are supplemented by crystal meth and sex.  When it is her turn to kill, Gallow's girlfriend Dr. Juliette Bath (Lauren Lee Smith), asks Grey for his help.  Accelerating his descent into darkness, Grey participates in a particularly cold-blooded kill, followed by some nasty celebratory sex.Things get complicated when Gwen Williamson (Alyssa Milano) Grey's fianc&eacute; comes to stay.  Gallo and Bath's relationship grows more unstable, and Gallo's resentment for Grey grows stronger when he discovers that there is something happening between Bath and Grey.  The game becomes more personal, and quickly spins way out of control as Gallo commits mass murder.  Recognizing things have gone too far, Dr. Gray makes a bold move to end the game.  Gallo counters striking a devastating blow, however Dr. Gray one more ace up his sleeve.The complete disregard for human life shown in Pathology, runs along comparable lines to the torture porn genre.  The participants in the game mix murder, sex, drug use, and a high level of intelligence to try and achieve an ultimate high.  The premise is not entirely original, but film does have some unexpected twists, and delivers some shocks, and graphic mostly post mortem gore.  This is definitely a movie where you have to go along, as the believability factor is very low.  Just one example of something that would not happen, is when after finishing an autopsy, Gray leaves the naked body uncovered, and walks out of the room while music plays.  Very dramatic, but not at all realistic given the identity of the deceased, and the circumstances, where a real coroner would be involved, in what should be a criminal investigation.The acting performances are very good, in that you don't really like any of the players in the game, particularly Michael Weston who comes across as particularly despicable.  In turning to the dark side, Milo Ventimiglia has the most challenging role, and he does it quite well, typically with a snotty look on his face.  Alyssa Milano's role is significant, though unfortunately she really doesn't have that much to do.The special features include a making of featurette, and a conversation with a real pathologist.

When he joins the Medical Center of the Metropolitan University in the department of Pathology and Forensics, he becomes the pride and joy of his professor Dr. Quentin Morris. However the star of the residence, Jake Gallo, becomes jealous with the newcomer. Nevertheless he invites Ted to participate with four other residents in a deadly game, where each participant must commit the perfect crime without any clue to reveal the modus-operandi of the murder, and the others investigate the corpse in the dungeon of the hospital. When Gwen decides to move to Ted's apartment, he decides to leave the group, but he finds resistance. This movie honestly delivered more than expected. Excellent direction, great photography, and solid performances really elevate this little horror/thriller movie.
