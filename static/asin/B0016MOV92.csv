1154357,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0016MOV92,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[8, 14]","It must have been sophomore week.  `Meet The Spartans (Rated)' and `Semi-Pro' were both released on June 3rd making them top competitors for the cheesiest comedy of the week.  Which one won is beyond the scope of my judgment, but both films had their moments, and both qualify for contenders of the year.`Semi-Pro' stars Will Ferrell, so we know partly what to expect of the material, but the quality is in position we're to pose during the field of play.  Ferrell plays Jackie Moon, the coach of NBA franchise expansion team, the Flint, Michigan ""Tropics"".  We can only deduce by the name that they had once belonged to a city known for warmer days, especially during the winters, but it's an effective touch, letting us know the daunting task of coming up from the gutter.The movie does this in more ways than one.  Jackie is one of the team's chief promoters.  Desperate, he resorts to anything from ""Free Gerbil Night"" to a fundraiser fight in a boxing ring with a ferocious bear.  Always at the mercy of the NBA Commissioner (David Koechner) and their hearing board, Jackie has to get his basketball team out of the doldrums and back in the heat.It's not all gloom and doom.  On their team is former Celtic and NBA championship ring bearer, Monix (Woody Harrelson) whose role in victory was cursory at best.  Still, the team has some potential pro players on their roster, making the goals at least tangible enough to keep us watching.  Part of the plot involves Monix renewing his interest in former flame, Lynne, which does little either for the plot or our interest.At the beginning the movie relies a lot on genital jokes, but just like the inspiration and perspiration, it only improves on form.  (It's not that I object per se, but don't expect this film to hit you like 'Superbad (Rated)' did.)  Oscar nominee Jackie Earl Haley doesn't provide much comedy, but he gets three-pointers (comparatively) for his acting.  Mainly a plot device, he improves the teamwork, but not by much.  The film's best assets come from the game announcers, Dick Pepperfield (Andrew Daly) and Lou Redwood (Will Arnett) who are just as crude as anyone else, but whose wit and delivery greatly improve the show.Farrell fans should note that he's still got the right touch.  Harrelson at times seems lackluster, so don't expect a `No Country for Old Men,' `Kingpin,' or even a Woody of 'Cheers' performance, but I can't fault him.  Blame Scot Armstrong's script--for, well--almost everything.  Overall, `Semi-Pro' is no `Blades of Glory (Full Screen Edition),' `Anchorman - The Legend Of Ron Burgundy (Unrated Full Screen Edition),' or 'Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (Unrated Full Screen Edition),' but if you can laugh at anything Farrell does, then you're in the game fer sure.  I vote for Clarence ""Coffee Black"" (Andre' Benjamin) as MVP for injecting some badly needed inspiration into the whole venue.The best scene:  Seeing the Tropics dressed in elaborate sea horse costumes, wiggling to disco music during the half-time show.The worst scene:  Watching a devoted fan get aroused while Monix gets intimately reacquainted with Lynne on the couch.Final thought:  I'll bet the promotional commercials sell more Old Spice underarm deodorant than DVD copies.  I don't want to be mean, but I hope so.",2,Missed Free Throw Opportunities,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,3303,"['must', 'have', 'been', 'sophomore', 'week', 'Meet', 'Spartans', 'Rated', 'Semi-Pro', 'were', 'released', 'June', '3rd', 'making', 'top', 'competitors', 'cheesiest', 'comedy', 'week', 'one', 'won', 'scope', 'judgment', 'films', 'had', 'moments', 'qualify', 'contenders', 'year.', 'Semi-Pro', 'stars', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'know', 'partly', 'what', 'expect', 'material', 'quality', 'position', ""'re"", 'pose', 'field', 'play', 'Ferrell', 'Jackie', 'Moon', 'coach', 'NBA', 'franchise', 'expansion', 'team', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'Tropics', 'can', 'only', 'deduce', 'name', 'had', 'once', 'belonged', 'city', 'known', 'warmer', 'days', 'especially', 'winters', 'effective', 'touch', 'letting', 'know', 'daunting', 'task', 'coming', 'up', 'gutter.The', 'movie', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Jackie', 'one', 'team', 'chief', 'promoters', 'Desperate', 'anything', 'Free', 'Gerbil', 'Night', 'fundraiser', 'fight', 'boxing', 'ring', 'ferocious', 'bear', 'Always', 'mercy', 'NBA', 'Commissioner', 'David', 'Koechner', 'hearing', 'board', 'Jackie', 'get', 'basketball', 'team', 'doldrums', 'back', 'heat.It', 'not', 'gloom', 'doom', 'team', 'former', 'Celtic', 'NBA', 'championship', 'ring', 'bearer', 'Monix', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'role', 'victory', 'was', 'cursory', 'best', 'Still', 'team', 'potential', 'pro', 'players', 'roster', 'making', 'goals', 'least', 'tangible', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'Part', 'plot', 'Monix', 'renewing', 'interest', 'former', 'flame', 'Lynne', 'little', 'either', 'plot', 'interest.At', 'beginning', 'movie', 'lot', 'genital', 'jokes', 'just', 'inspiration', 'perspiration', 'only', 'form', 'not', 'object', 'se', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'hit', 'Rated', 'did', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Jackie', 'Earl', 'Haley', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'comedy', 'three-pointers', 'comparatively', 'acting', 'Mainly', 'plot', 'device', 'teamwork', 'not', 'much', 'film', 'best', 'assets', 'come', 'game', 'announcers', 'Dick', 'Pepperfield', 'Andrew', 'Daly', 'Lou', 'Redwood', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'crude', 'anyone', 'else', 'wit', 'delivery', 'greatly', 'improve', 'show.Farrell', 'fans', 'should', 'note', 'still', 'got', 'right', 'touch', 'Harrelson', 'times', 'lackluster', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Kingpin', 'even', 'Woody', ""'Cheers"", 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'Blame', 'Scot', 'Armstrong', 'script', 'well', 'almost', 'everything', 'Overall', 'Semi-Pro', 'Blades', 'Glory', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'Anchorman', 'Legend', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'Unrated', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'Nights', 'Ballad', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'Unrated', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'can', 'laugh', 'anything', 'Farrell', 'then', ""'re"", 'game', 'fer', 'sure', 'vote', 'Clarence', 'Coffee', 'Black', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'MVP', 'injecting', 'badly', 'needed', 'inspiration', 'whole', 'venue.The', 'best', 'scene', 'Seeing', 'Tropics', 'dressed', 'elaborate', 'sea', 'horse', 'costumes', 'wiggling', 'disco', 'music', 'half-time', 'show.The', 'worst', 'scene', 'Watching', 'devoted', 'fan', 'get', 'aroused', 'Monix', 'intimately', 'reacquainted', 'Lynne', 'couch.Final', 'thought', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'promotional', 'commercials', 'sell', 'more', 'Old', 'Spice', 'underarm', 'deodorant', 'DVD', 'copies', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'mean', 'hope', 'so']",N/A

1154359,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B0016MOV92,Amanda Richards,"[2, 3]","Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):Time: The `70s1. Will Ferrell plays Jackie Moon, a one hit wonder who owns, coaches and plays with his basketball team the Flint Tropics.2. As you would expect, the team isn't doing very well3. Down and out, but not giving up, Moon negotiates a chance for his team to join the NBA4. Maybe white men can't jump, but he trades a major appliance for Ed Monnix (Woody Harrelson) anyway5. Coffee Black (Andre Benjamin) finds his form and soon the team is no longer considered the ""OutKast"" of the ABA6. Moon raises the entertainment level to include dancing seahorses and bear wresting at half time7. After receiving some valuable advice from Patti Labelle, the team almost achieves the predictable.This is typical Will Ferrell stuff - I'd rate it better thanStep Brothers, but worse thanBlades of Glory.  Ferrell's over the top antics are the main reason for watching this movie, even though at times it's more like morbid fascination.  Andre Benjamin is good, even though his impressive afro is even better, and Harrelson? He hasn't changed a bit.Rent (don't buy) for the basketball, and stay for the half-time show.Jackie Moon: Everybody panic!

1154364,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B0016MOV92,Bill Garrison,"[1, 3]","Semi-Pro is your typical Will Ferrell movie. The movie creates its own universe of 1970s era ABA basketball and fills it with nutty basketball players and flamboyent secondary characters. The movie's best moments are the minor characters and the moments they are given to shine. Semi-Pro perfectly captures the heart of the 70s, unfortunately the movie itself has no heart. Ferrell's Jackie Love is amusing, yet we have no reason to care for him and his quest to finish in fourth place and win a spot in the NBA for the Flynt Tropics.The Flynt Tropics are a joke in the ABA. Jackie Moon, owner, coach, power forward, and singer with a hit single, is ruinning the team. He knows nothing about basketball but excels in absurd promotions. You can see how this is a good set up for laughs, and there are a few there, but the movie lacks a cohesive story, and it starts with Woody Harrelson. Harrelson is a washed up NBA star named Monix brought in to help the team. He takes the coaching reins from Ferrell and develops a relationship with Maura Tierney's character, Lynn. This is the movie's only attempt at establishing a relationship the viewers might care about, yet it is botched completely. How did Monix and Lynn know each other? Why did they break up? Who is Lynn currently living with? Her brother, her boyfriend, her husband. So many parts of the movie made no sense.This is Farrell's worst movie in a long time. While the movie is set in the world of basketball, basketball has nothing to do with the moive. There is no drama related to sports. There is no drama related to the characters. I guess die hard Ferrell fans should watch this movie.

If you can make it through the first half of the film, where the filmmakers struggle to find the right mix of humour and drama, you'll be rewarded for a much more satisfying second half that pays off your patience for sticking it out.This edition is loaded with extras all of which are included on the second disc while the first disc includes both the rated and unrated versions of the film.There are four deleted/alternate scenes. Sportscaster Dick Pepperfield provides the backstory to Jackie Moon and his team. We see Monix's prologue and how he deals with an obnoxious heckler. In an amusing montage, we find out what happens to all the major characters, which really should have been kept in.Also included are three improv scenes. We get more the play-by-play banter from Lou and Dick with Will Arnett adlibbing all sorts of raunchy observations. There is also more of Jackie and Dick on the Tropics Weekly TV show which allows Farrell to cut loose with more clueless observations.""A Short History of the ABA"" takes a look at the actual ABA with former players reminiscing about it and clips of vintage footage. There are some interesting factoids that revealed, like how it started the three-point shot and introduced a more colourful, dynamic style of play that was eventually absorbed into the NBA.""Re-creating the ABA"" examines how the filmmakers authentically re-created the look and feel of the era. The cast went through an intensive, four-week training camp in order to be able to play like they did in the `70s.""'Love Me Sexy': The Story Behind the One Hit Wonder"" takes a look at how Jackie's hit song came together. Musician/producer Nile Rodgers worked on the music, which makes perfect sense as his hey day was the `70s, and Farrell adlibbed some of the lyrics at a cast reading. The result is a song that sounds like it could have come from that era.""Bill Walton Visits the Set"" features the NBA legend shooting a cameo for the film.

1154371,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0016MOV92,DanD,"[0, 2]","Will Ferrell has proven that he has comic chops unrivaled in Hollywood today; ""Anchorman"" remains an absolute classic, and ""Talledega Nights"" isn't far behind.  There are others, of course; I am a fan of his, and am not ashamed to call myself one.But the Sports Comedy sub-genre is wearing thin.  ""Semi-Pro"" is a brave effort, and it delivers some genuine laughs; however, it just feels tired, used, like we've been here before (and it enjoyed it much, much more).  Woody Harrelson and Maura Tierney sleepwalk through their performances; they know they can (and have) done better comedy than this.  Andre Benjamin is a standout here; he shines with such charisma and comedic timing (except for a few clunker lines near the movie's end), you almost wish he had a starring role in another slapstick feature (which he probably will sometime in the future).  Supporting roles by the usual Ferrell supporters (Andy Richter, David Koechner, Rob Corddry, etc.) help flesh out the film, but unfortunately don't provide the substance we need.  As for Ferrell himself--well, he's just channeling Ricky Bobby and Ron Burgandy.  Not to say he isn't good--he is; there was real potential in Jackie Moon--but he's just not doing anything we haven't seen in two other, better-written movies.The main flaw with the movie is that the pacing is off.  Scenes that are supposed to strike us as ridiculously funny don't, because they haven't been built up to that level yet.  The movie has its moments--you'll chuckle, I promise you--but when the funniest line is uttered right before the final credits roll...well, something's wrong.  ""Semi-Pro"" feels like its makers put only half their hearts into it.  With all the talent going into it, it could have been so much more than it is.

Ferrell's trademark obnoxious, sophomoric, frat mentality comedy appeals to immature nimrods like me; yet for all Ferrell's outrageous antics, they weren't near enough to save SEMI-PRO.I first saw this movie during its theatrical release; during the showing the entire theatre was quiet, with an occasional cough or chuckle.  It was one of the most surreal things I've ever experienced.  Obviously, I wasn't alone in thinking there just wasn't anything of substance to this story about the old, flashy ABA of the Seventies--a league, with the exception of four lucky franchises about to be absorbed by the NBA, on the cusp of folding.  I recently gave SEMI-PRO another chance by watching it on cable.  I felt embarrassed.Playing disco pop sensation Jackie Moon--a celebrity who buys and promotes his own ABA team, the Flint Tropics--Ferrell does all the ostentatious things he does in all his other movies; yet this time they don't click.  There's no rhythm or pacing to the story, it's just one disjointed and incoherent scene following another.  Woody Harrelson playing a washed-up NBA player brought in to save the Tropics adds nothing, Will Arnett and Andrew Daly as the broadcast team for the Tropics add little more, and David Koechner as an overwhelmed ABA commissioner has remarkably little that's funny to say.  Everything is contrived, forced, uneven, banal, then ultimately forgettable.And it's a shame, because SEMI-PRO had potential.  But, alas, it's like a 1973 Cadillac left for scrap.  Nothing works.--D.

Ferrell-Moon resorts to ridiculous stunts and pre-pubescent jokes to keep fans in their seats. Unfortunately, they are mostly lame or trite and only young teenagers or dribbling senior citizens will be amused. Moreover, the basketball scenes look directed by a teenager or dribbling senior; and, the editing is amateurish.Kent Alterman, former executive producer (moneyman) for Ferrell's ""Elf"" movie, makes his directorial debut and should stick to financing. The script was written by Scot Armstrong who previously wrote Road Trip and Old School and seems to have simply rehashed material from previous Ferrell movies.Supporting Ferrell are Woody Harrelson, Andre Benjamin and Andy Richter. Harrelson is neither funny or inspiring. Perhaps he needed money because he appears bored and going through the motions simply for a pay check. Semi Pro quickly fouls out and it is easy to see why it bombed at the box-office during opening weekend despite playing at 3100 theaters. It almost bombed as bad as Stranger Than Fiction, the worst opening film for Ferrell, which only generated $13.4 million.Plus, this was the final nail in the coffin for New Line Cinema as it made Time-Warner executives fold the 40-year old company into Warner Brothers and fire New Line chiefs Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne. So, Semi Pro can claim the dubious distinction as ""the movie that destroyed New Line Cinema."" I guess for some that is reason to watch. But, this film is not as funny as Talledega Nights and never equals the comedy of Blades of Glory. In reality the title is appropriate. It never scores and quickly fouls out. In reality, the title should be ""Amateur.""

He was also a disco singer who had one hit, called 'Love Me Sexy' and he insists on playing the song to death throughout the movie. Anyways, the Flint Tropics happen to be the worst team in the ABA (sound familiar yet?), mostly due to Jackie's lack of direction. It is soon revealed that the ABA will cease to exist and only 4 teams will be merged into the National Basketball Association (NBA). When Jackie finds out that his team will not be integrated into the NBA, he attempts to whip his team into shape. With the help of former Kentucky Colonels player Ed Monix (Woody Harrelson), Jackie plans to push the Tropics to victory, and into the NBA.What follows is your typical heartfelt, underdog sports story (with the Will Farrell brand of comedy of course). If you've ever seen 'Blades of Glory' or 'Dodgeball' or any of the other numerous underdog sports films then you know exactly how this film will turn out. The ending doesn't turn out exactly as the aforementioned films do, but there are enough similarities in this movie that its hard not to draw comparisons. The jokes run the usual gamot, with potty, genital and sexual jokes being at the forefront. To be quite honest most of the jokes feel way too outdated to be funny; I seem to remember similar punch lines in Farrell's previous outings. Farrel gives the impression that he is merely giving us a phoned in performance, but being that he's been making the same movies since Anchorman I don't blame him. The supporting actors are decent, though nothing really stands out aside from Andre 3000, who seems to be getter better at acting. Even Harrelson seems like he's nonplussed to be appearing in this mediocre film, and his performance reeks of lazy. Will Arnett (Arrested Development) plays an alcoholic sports play by play announcer, however he feels rather underused here. Every single joke he throws out is un-funny.I watched this movie not expecting to enjoy it, and honestly there wasn't really a funny joke to be found. Will Farrell, one of the more successful of the SNL alumni has found his niche and he is running with it no matter how atrocious and stale the end result may be. He just keeps pumping out the same jokes and the same routine over and over, and we keep eating it up. If you are a Farrell fan then purchasing this film is probably a no-brainer, but if you are sick of his usual shtick like I am you may just want to rent this one.As far as this Blu Ray edition is concerned, the theatrical cut and the 'Lets get sweaty' unrated cut are featured on one disc, while a second disc houses a load of special features. The differences between the two versions of the film are negligible.  The special features are your usual  comedy special feature fare, nothing too great.The picture quality is decent; 'Semi-Pro' isn't going to turn any heads but its a step above the Standard DVD. Colors are rather vivid and blacks  are deep and realistic. Detail is present but very inconsistent, and there is a fair bit of grain spiking in some scenes. Since this is a comedy with rather bland 70's colors I didn't except demo material, but 'Semi-pro' looks pretty good. As far as the audio is concerned, 'Semi-Pro' comes with a 7.1 mix, though the subject material never fully utilizes it.I'm sure this isn't the last of the 'underdog' films, and certainly not the last Ferrell underdog film. I really wish it was, because these movies are getting really tiresome.Movie Quality - 2/5Picture Quality - 4/5Audio Quality - 3/5Special Features - 1/5",2,Yawn....this seems all to familiar,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,3721,"[""'Semi-Pro"", 'latest', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'film', 'Jackie', 'Moon', 'owner', 'coach', 'power', 'forward', 'fictional', 'Flint', 'Tropics', 'basketball', 'team', 'American', 'Basketball', 'Association', 'ABA', 'was', 'also', 'disco', 'singer', 'who', 'had', 'one', 'hit', 'called', 'Me', 'Sexy', 'playing', 'song', 'death', 'movie', 'Anyways', 'Flint', 'Tropics', 'happen', 'be', 'worst', 'team', 'ABA', 'sound', 'familiar', 'yet', 'mostly', 'due', 'Jackie', 'lack', 'direction', 'soon', 'revealed', 'ABA', 'will', 'cease', 'exist', 'only', '4', 'teams', 'will', 'be', 'merged', 'National', 'Basketball', 'Association', 'NBA', 'When', 'Jackie', 'out', 'team', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'integrated', 'NBA', 'whip', 'team', 'shape', 'help', 'former', 'Kentucky', 'Colonels', 'player', 'Ed', 'Monix', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Jackie', 'push', 'Tropics', 'victory', 'NBA.What', 'typical', 'heartfelt', 'underdog', 'sports', 'story', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'brand', 'comedy', 'course', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'Blades"", 'Glory', ""'Dodgeball"", 'other', 'numerous', 'underdog', 'sports', 'films', 'then', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'film', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'ending', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'exactly', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'do', 'are', 'enough', 'similarities', 'movie', 'hard', 'not', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'jokes', 'run', 'usual', 'gamot', 'potty', 'genital', 'sexual', 'jokes', 'being', 'forefront', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'most', 'jokes', 'feel', 'way', 'too', 'outdated', 'be', 'funny', 'seem', 'remember', 'similar', 'punch', 'lines', 'Farrell', 'previous', 'outings', 'Farrel', 'impression', 'merely', 'giving', 'phoned', 'performance', 'being', 'been', 'making', 'same', 'movies', 'Anchorman', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'decent', 'nothing', 'really', 'out', 'aside', 'Andre', '3000', 'who', 'be', 'getter', 'better', 'acting', 'Even', 'Harrelson', 'nonplussed', 'be', 'appearing', 'mediocre', 'film', 'performance', 'reeks', 'lazy', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'alcoholic', 'sports', 'play', 'play', 'announcer', 'however', 'rather', 'underused', 'here', 'Every', 'single', 'joke', 'out', 'un-funny.I', 'movie', 'not', 'expecting', 'enjoy', 'honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'funny', 'joke', 'be', 'found', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'one', 'more', 'successful', 'SNL', 'alumni', 'found', 'niche', 'running', 'matter', 'how', 'atrocious', 'end', 'result', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'keeps', 'pumping', 'out', 'same', 'jokes', 'same', 'routine', 'keep', 'eating', 'up', 'are', 'Farrell', 'fan', 'then', 'purchasing', 'film', 'probably', 'no-brainer', 'are', 'sick', 'usual', 'shtick', 'am', 'may', 'just', 'want', 'rent', 'one.As', 'far', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'edition', 'concerned', 'theatrical', 'cut', ""'Lets"", 'get', 'sweaty', 'unrated', 'cut', 'are', 'featured', 'one', 'disc', 'second', 'disc', 'houses', 'load', 'special', 'features', 'differences', 'two', 'versions', 'film', 'are', 'negligible', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'usual', 'comedy', 'special', 'feature', 'fare', 'nothing', 'too', 'great.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'decent', ""'Semi-Pro"", ""n't"", 'going', 'turn', 'heads', 'step', 'Standard', 'DVD', 'Colors', 'are', 'rather', 'vivid', 'blacks', 'are', 'deep', 'realistic', 'Detail', 'present', 'very', 'inconsistent', 'fair', 'bit', 'grain', 'spiking', 'scenes', 'comedy', 'rather', 'bland', '70', 'colors', 'did', ""n't"", 'except', 'demo', 'material', ""'Semi-pro"", 'pretty', 'good', 'As', 'far', 'audio', 'concerned', ""'Semi-Pro"", '7.1', 'mix', 'subject', 'material', 'never', 'fully', 'utilizes', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'sure', ""n't"", 'last', ""'underdog"", 'films', 'certainly', 'not', 'last', 'Ferrell', 'underdog', 'film', 'really', 'wish', 'was', 'movies', 'are', 'getting', 'really', 'tiresome.Movie', 'Quality', '2/5Picture', 'Quality', '4/5Audio', 'Quality', '3/5Special', 'Features', '1/5']",N/A

Surprisingly, this is a decent movie with some memorable scenes (did you call me a jive turkey?). I think what holds it back from the normal zaniness is the screenplay, which tends to stick to the formula of sports films -- aging player's redemption, young player learning how to be less selfish, and general team camaraderie. This requires more of an ensemble cast performance but without the regular craziness that surrounds Ferrell, he seems a bit too over the top in some cases (consider the 'love' story with Harrelson & Tierney -- the only thing strange about it is Corrdry's excitement that his girlfriend is cheating with a basketball player -- otherwise, it's typical love story.) David Koechner, who normally goes just as crazy in his roles, plays this one straight. It seems like Ferrell is the only one reaching for wackiness or the only one the director trusted to reach for wackiness.In the end, it's all about expectations.

Seeing his track record (remember Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Elf?!), it's clear he's put in effort for this feel-good sport-theme based movie, but at times he's gone over the top.The story revolves around a small-time basketball team, who's happy to be just that - small-time. Till, they are made to realize they want to be part of NBA and play some ""real basketball"". The story is almost believable, and one can appreciate the feeling that the movie exudes. However, some so-called funny scenes are really unnecessary and some are outright crap! (I'll admit the reason for such crappy scenes might be that I was watching the unrated version.)His promotion tactics are almost hilarious but never quite there. The costume dance, the eye-liner, the bear-fight - all are painfully but strictly not-funny. The euphoria towards the end seemed to me to be the best part of this movie.Watch it - if you're really into Ferrell.

1154384,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0016MOV92,Jason,"[1, 2]","Semi Pro is the newest installment of Will Ferrell's growing line of successful comedies.  It is a fairly decent addition, with enough laughs to make it worthwhile, but not nearly his funniest addition.  I liked it nonetheless.Ferrell plays Jackie Moon, a throwback to the 1970's ABA days.  He has the style and look of Bill Walton without the injuries, and the ridiculous outfits of modern-day Craig Sager.  Moon is a former disco performer of relatively little success, but success enough to purchase the Flint Tropics.  His good luck continues to get better when in 1976, he learns that the NBA is going to bring in four teams from the ABA.  His team is not the greatest, assembled with the typical collection of misfits befitting a sports movie.What throws off his plans, however, is the league institutes a new plan: they will only allow the ABA to NBA transition if a team averages over a certain number of fans per night.  And that's where the oddball comedic twists come in: the Bear wrestling, the trade involving a washing machine and a player, and the roller-skating jump over cheerleaders.  He'll do anything to get into the NBA.Aside from the stupidity of the forced drama coming from Maura Tierney's character -- just like the forced drama in films likeMajor LeagueandHoosiers-- the film is full of enough laughs and physical comedy to make it enjoyable.  It covers nearly no new ground, following the sports movie paint-by-numbers approach nearly well enough that the makers of previous movies could sue for plagiarism, but it's not supposed to make you think or ponder.  It's pure, mindless comedy.  The formula is there because it works.  It worked as far back asSlap Shot (25th Anniversary Special Edition)andThe Bad News Bears.Some may not like Ferrell's style of work, but comedy actors typically work best with comedies.  Action veterans typically stay with action flicks.  And Jet Li will always do movies with martial arts.  To take Will Ferrell out of his element is to avoid what he does best.  It'll get old to some (see nearly the same character in Talladega Nights, Anchorman, Blades of Glory, etc.), but for those of us who are big Will Ferrell fans, he can keep making movies like this until he runs out of sports.

Even though Semi-Pro can be very funny, and I suppose I'd go just for those laughs, it suffers under clumsily executed tonal changes -- from funny to weirdly serious to half-baked romantic -- that keep the film from finding its footing.

Back to the disco dancing and roller skating days. Back to when basketball players wore really...REALLY... short shorts.Will Ferrell plays Jackie Moon who made a ton of money from his song ""Love Me Sexy"". What does Jackie go and do with it? He's buys himself a basketball team in the ABA called the Flint `Michigan' Tropicals. Jackie is a one man show who not only owns the Tropicals, but also coaches them. And to get fans into the stadium, he even promotes them with outlandish themes such as jumping over 10 cheerleaders while he's wearing roller-skates. Then one day it's decided that the ABA and the NBA will merge into one, and that 4 teams will go to the NBA. Jackie convinces them to let the 4 BEST teams go, not the 4 most popular. The commish, to make it harder on the not so popular teams, also says they have to bring in at least 2000 fans each game. So Jackie tries everything from free Corn Dog night to Jackie Wrestles Bear night. There are a decent amount of funny parts in the movie, but in all seriousness, the story is better than the comedy this time around.To me the comedy seemed extremely forced in some parts. Usually Will Ferrell can just flow comedy out of his mouth without even a problem. But here it seemed he didn't have much help from his supporting cast when it came to impromptu time. Sometimes Will's antics will make you laugh and sometimes you wish Will would just put his comedy on hold for a few minutes so he could be fresh again. Now don't get me wrong though, there are funny parts in the movie. I for one liked the bear wrestling scene and also the interaction between Jackie Moon and the ref that is a priest. But that also has to do with the language that is used and there is a LOT of fowl language coming out of Ferrell's mouth in this movie. MF'r, F That, C-Sucker, and a lot more. I'm sure there will be more on the unrated version, but I have yet to see that one.I'd also like to say that Andre Benjamin (from the rap group Outkast) did a really good job in this movie playing Clarence `Coffee' Black. The interaction on the bus between him and Woody Harrelson had me cringing in a good way cause I could just feel the tension between the two. Also Andre, with his big fro and all, just seemed like he should've lived in this time. Everything about him just seemed 70's. Great job.All in all, this is definitely a rent especially if you like Ferrell.

Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell) owns, operates, and plays for the Flint Tropics, which is the laughing stock of the American Basketball Association.  Upon hearing the news that there will be a merger between the ABA and the NBA, Moon rejoices... until he hears that only the best teams will make the merger while the others will fold.  Distressed, Jackie starts to inspire his group to be better, which includes bringing in veteran player Ed Monix (Woody Harrelson) to help fortify the playing style of the emerging Coffee Black (Andre Benjamin).  Will the team succeed long enough to make it to the NBA?Now, you can't all expect them to be hits with Will Ferrell and this is definitely an example of that.  The jokes were tired after a while and while an uplifting story, it just seemed quite dull in comparison to the other comedies that have been recently released.

Ferrell stars as Jackie Moon; a former pop sensation who owns the Tropics ABA team.  However, the ABA is crumbling, and the NBA is absorbing a number of teams, and naturally the Tropics aren't one of them.  Soon enough, Jackie and his crew of lovable losers (including Woody Harrelson and Andre Benjamin) start playing seriously, and Jackie orchestrates one chaotic marketing gig after another.  Where Semi-Pro fails the most is that the film drags in a number of spots, and just doesn't have as many laughs as the previously mentioned Ferrell vehicles.  Still, the good in Semi-Pro outweighs the bad, with some great casting in the vein of Harrelson as a washed-up former NBA'er, who has many great moments in the film.

The first half of the film is hilarious and then the humor leaves about halfway through the film.The beginning of the film is very promising.  We get an idea of who Jackie Moon is, how he got to take charge of the Flint Tropics and his wild antics.  During a poker game with Moon and some friends, Ferrel pulls some hilarious improv bits.  This was Ferrel in Anchoman mode.But then comes the troublesome plot.  This is where Ferrel's prior films differ from Semi-Pro.  In movies like Anchorman or Talladega Nights, the plots are intentionally low key and elementary, so the stars can display their antics with ease.  Semi-Pro's plot, the basic ""rag tag team becomes really good"" has to be resoloved and seems to be resolved in an almost formulaic sports movie way.The saddest part is this Will Ferrel vehicle seems to shift the importance on co stars Woody Harleson and Andre Benjamin in the second half.  They're fine actors and are great in their roles, but they're roles are played straight. Ferrel is left goofing around a bit, but has to get through the formulaic plot and his supporting players, making it difficult for him to get good comedic bits in the second half.Perhaps the biggest shame of all is the promise this movie had from previews and accompanying promotional materials (some of which are included on the dvd).  Between Flint Tropics phone number to call on the previews and some after shave ads, Ferrel looked like he was ready to churn out another Anchorman.

1154409,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0016MOV92,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 9]","*1/2""Semi-Pro"" is an aggressively unfunny dumb-jock comedy that marks a possible low point in the careers of Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson and Maura Tierney (although the latter, lucky for her, is not really in the movie long enough to do her reputation permanent damage).It's the 1970's and the short-lived American Basketball Association (1967-1976) is getting ready to close its doors due to a lack of money and little interest on the part of the three major networks in televising its games.  However, four of the league's top-ranking teams will remain intact and be absorbed into the more successful NBA.  That means that the Tropics, the fictitious team from Flint, Michigan, will soon be disbanding, unless the players can get their act together and reverse their current losing streak.  Ferrell plays Jackie Moon, who doubles as both the head coach and one of the key players on the Tropics.  As such, it's his job to whip the players into shape if the team is to have any hope of becoming one of the chosen four.Here is a movie in which literally nothing works - not the concept, not the performances and certainly not the writing.  Indeed, the makers of ""Semi-Pro"" seem to think that merely throwing the decidedly doughy Ferrell into a basketball uniform and having him shooting hoops with a bunch of equally dweeby knuckleheads would be just too hilarious for words.  It isn`t.  In fact, in this movie virtually every joke, pratfall and sight gag lands on the court with a resounding thud, despite the best efforts of its hapless cast.  I guess the one lesson to be gleaned from all this is that funky fashions and quaint `70's references alone are not enough to carry a movie, especially when one is stuck with a script as devoid of taste, imagination and humor as the one Scot Armstrong has come up with here.And, of course, as appears to be the case with all the worst comedies, ""Semi-Pro"" finds it necessary to end with an outtake blooper reel, on the bizarre assumption that if we didn`t laugh at any of the bits that DID make it into the final product, then we will somehow fall on the floor in hysterics at all the ones that DIDN`T.

So why then do we continue to get things that are just not that good? Will Farrel is fast beginning to resemble a one trick pony more than a sincerely talented actor and I keep finding myself wondering why the guy from Anchorman has yet to recapture that magic.Semi-Pro has no truly funny moments at all and instead focuses on a tired underdog sports story to carry the day. The hilarious David Koechner is wasted as the ABA commissioner and we are left to watch Woody Harrelson and Maura Tierney yawn their way through their cliched roles and forced romantic sub-plot.Like so many lame comedies, you realize that you've seen the best parts of the movie via the heavy promotion this movie received and even that didn't stop this from tanking. It's just not that funny. The best scene is the poker game and that's not saying much since that scene isn't even that good. Semi-Pro is overloaded with the same stale 70s jokes that were better done in Anchorman, a horde of bizarre and underdeveloped characters (the ref/priest, Jackie Moon's freak wife, Andy Richter's role, etc.), and plenty of Will Farrell simply riffing his way through scenes and hoping for the best. Making matters worse, Farrell fades into the background half-way through and what little was left of the comedy dries up as well.Rent it if you must, but trust me, this isn't a movie you're going to want to own to watch again and again.

Love Me Sexy was written for the film and seems to borrow from the styles of the times the movie is set in, in this case the mid '70's.  As it turns out, the soundtrack for the movie offers a decent selection of 1970's hit songs and for those who grew up in the era it's a nice reminder of the times.Jackie takes the money he has made from his hit record and uses it to buy an ABA franchise that he moves from Florida to his own home town of Flint, Michigan (though that isn't explained well in the final cut of the film, and instead you learn that information via deleted and bonus scenes included on the second of the two discs in the Blu-ray package).  Jackie's skill set is firmly grounded in choreography and marketing, though as owner of the Flint Tropics basketball team he has given himself a role as a player and coach of the team he owns.Early in the film we find that Jackie and his teammates, while having fun playing, aren't all that serious as basketball players.  The league itself is experiencing financial difficulties, and the Tropics are facing a similar situation.  Fans aren't filling the arena, and despite Jackie's best efforts at putting on a show that will get fans to come to the games, the lack of financial stability shows through in background comments from team personnel and announcers that note that they haven't been paid.Jackie heads off to a league owners meeting where a merger between the ABA and NBA is confirmed.  Hearing this news, Jackie gets enthusiastic at the idea of becoming an owner of a team in the NBA only to find that the teams that will be absorbed into the NBA don't include his own.  A mini-revolt amongst the team owners (lead by Jackie) results in a vote to have the teams that will be brought into the NBA determined by the standings of the teams in the league.  Though the Tropics are mired in the cellar of the league standings, Jackie sees hope in the idea that if he can get his team to perform he may yet be able to keep his team alive.The rest of the story borrows heavily from various sports films including Major League though several anecdotes from the good old days of the ABA are tossed in for good measure, including the idea that one player (Woody Harrelson's Ed Monix) is traded to another team in exchange for a clothes washer.  Can the Tropics improve their record enough to stay in business?  Can they raise their attendance enough to seem to be a viable team?  You'll have to watch the film to find out.The sports cliche's are thick, and the jokes aren't quite as plentiful as you would think.  Again, mixed in here pretty well is a great deal of respect and admiration for the little league that could, the ABA.Definitely check out the extras on the second disc, including a short history of the ABA, in doing so you'll gain extra insight into how this film came to be and just what the writer and director were trying to achieve (not that you can't tell from watching the film, but you will likely appreciate the effort all the more after seeing the extras).Look for cameos from some of the ABA's great players, along with interviews of those same players in the extras.Language in the un-rated edition is pretty coarse, along with some graphically implied sexual content and sexual innuendo.  Easily worth a rental, with extra value for people that remember the ABA or want to learn a little more about the league.",4,"A nice tribute to the ABA, not as Ferrell centric as you'd think...",1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,3937,"['movie', 'fairly', 'clearly', 'tribute', 'glory', 'days', 'ABA', 'American', 'Basketball', 'Association', 'one-time', 'competitor', 'National', 'Basketball', 'Association', 'tribute', 'cached', 'comedy', 'feature', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Benjamin', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Maura', 'Tierney', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'others', '.In', 'Semi-Pro', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'Jackie', 'Moon', 'made', 'fortune', 'thanks', 'becoming', 'one-hit', 'wonder', 'R', 'B', 'singer', 'song', 'featured', 'early', 'film', 'Love', 'Me', 'Sexy', 'Me', 'Sexy', 'was', 'written', 'film', 'borrow', 'styles', 'times', 'movie', 'set', 'case', 'mid', 'out', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'decent', 'selection', '1970', 'hit', 'songs', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'era', 'nice', 'reminder', 'times.Jackie', 'money', 'made', 'hit', 'record', 'buy', 'ABA', 'franchise', 'Florida', 'own', 'home', 'town', 'Flint', 'Michigan', ""n't"", 'explained', 'well', 'final', 'cut', 'film', 'instead', 'learn', 'information', 'deleted', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'included', 'second', 'two', 'discs', 'Blu-ray', 'package', 'Jackie', 'skill', 'set', 'firmly', 'grounded', 'choreography', 'marketing', 'owner', 'Flint', 'Tropics', 'basketball', 'team', 'given', 'role', 'player', 'coach', 'team', 'owns.Early', 'film', 'find', 'Jackie', 'teammates', 'having', 'fun', 'playing', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'serious', 'basketball', 'players', 'league', 'experiencing', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'Tropics', 'are', 'facing', 'similar', 'situation', 'Fans', 'are', ""n't"", 'filling', 'arena', 'Jackie', 'best', 'efforts', 'putting', 'show', 'will', 'get', 'fans', 'come', 'games', 'lack', 'financial', 'stability', 'background', 'comments', 'team', 'personnel', 'announcers', 'note', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'paid.Jackie', 'heads', 'league', 'owners', 'meeting', 'where', 'merger', 'ABA', 'NBA', 'confirmed', 'Hearing', 'news', 'Jackie', 'enthusiastic', 'idea', 'becoming', 'owner', 'team', 'NBA', 'only', 'find', 'teams', 'will', 'be', 'absorbed', 'NBA', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'own', 'mini-revolt', 'amongst', 'team', 'owners', 'lead', 'Jackie', 'results', 'vote', 'have', 'teams', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'NBA', 'determined', 'standings', 'teams', 'league', 'Tropics', 'are', 'mired', 'cellar', 'league', 'standings', 'Jackie', 'hope', 'idea', 'can', 'get', 'team', 'perform', 'may', 'yet', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'team', 'alive.The', 'rest', 'story', 'heavily', 'various', 'sports', 'films', 'including', 'Major', 'League', 'several', 'anecdotes', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'ABA', 'are', 'tossed', 'good', 'measure', 'including', 'idea', 'one', 'player', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Ed', 'Monix', 'traded', 'team', 'exchange', 'clothes', 'washer', 'Can', 'Tropics', 'improve', 'record', 'enough', 'stay', 'business', 'Can', 'raise', 'attendance', 'enough', 'seem', 'be', 'viable', 'team', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'find', 'out.The', 'sports', 'cliche', 'are', 'thick', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'plentiful', 'would', 'think', 'Again', 'mixed', 'here', 'pretty', 'well', 'great', 'deal', 'respect', 'admiration', 'little', 'league', 'could', 'ABA.Definitely', 'check', 'extras', 'second', 'disc', 'including', 'short', 'history', 'ABA', 'doing', 'so', ""'ll"", 'gain', 'extra', 'insight', 'how', 'film', 'came', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'writer', 'director', 'were', 'trying', 'achieve', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'appreciate', 'effort', 'more', 'seeing', 'extras', '.Look', 'cameos', 'ABA', 'great', 'players', 'interviews', 'same', 'players', 'extras.Language', 'un-rated', 'edition', 'pretty', 'coarse', 'graphically', 'implied', 'sexual', 'content', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'Easily', 'rental', 'extra', 'value', 'people', 'remember', 'ABA', 'want', 'learn', 'little', 'more', 'league']",N/A
1154419,A2VOSR1A3MLFKM,B0016MOV92,"The Captain ""Bounty628""","[1, 2]","Perhaps it is becoming more and more evident that Will Ferrell is far better cast as a cameo appearance actor. Though he tends to be quit humorous in roles where he is not the lead actor, it is when the weight of the success of the film is in Ferrell's shoulders that he seems to falter time and time again. One really not need look any further than Taladega Nights to realize this but if that is not enough proof to support the hypothesis for you, then check out Semi-Pro.Directed by Kent Alterman and written by Scot Armstrong, Semi-Pro is a rather lackluster comedy film that nails stupidity quite well but falls short in providing any real comedy throughout the entire film. There are merely a glimmer of comedy spread here and there throughout the film but the movie really seems to be a lot of tired old Will Ferrell jokes and humor.Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell) is the owner-coach-player of the American Basketball Association's team the Flint Michigan Tropics. Moon, a sultry R&B; artist known best for his song ""Love Me Sexy"" is equally as good at being an owner, a coach and a player on a professional ABA team, and that does not say much. His basketball prowess focuses on catch and pass time and time again and his coaching and ownership stake is more focused on coming up with witty pre-game introductions than it is on running a basketball program.Andre Benjamin (of Outkast fame) plays the part of Clarence, perhaps one of the finest players on the Tropics squad. However, his skills being so far above some of the others on the Tropics also makes him the constant prized possession of so many other basketball teams. Though Clarence does change his name in the film to Coffee Black, there is nothing really all that strong about the peformance that Benjamin puts into the film.The diamond in the rough for this film is the character of Ed Monix played by Woody Harrelson. Harrelson plays the part of a washed up former NBA player whose stints included spending significant time for several clubs on the court, but mostly on the bench. If it were not for Harrelson's performance in this film the entire movie would have needed to have been scrapped.When the ABA decides that they are going to downsize and fold the remaining teams into the NBA, the owners need to come up with some sort of way to determine which teams will be on the chopping block and which will make it to the big time. The ultimate decision that was rendered now leaves the Flint Michigan Tropics fighting for a chance to make it into the big scene.Moon decides that since his playing is certainly not going to launch him into the NBA that perhaps he can reinvigorate the fan base in Flint by a series of stupid entertainment promotions. Not only are Moon's ideas quite cheesy, but the fact that the viewer is subjected to have to sit there and watch his ideas come to life on screen is just as cheesy on the part of the writer and director.Though when Will Ferrell is involved you are not expecting the most cinematographic piece of excellence, Semi-Pro does not even deserve to be called a minor league film. Just as the Flint Michigan Tropics were never going to make it in the basketball world, this film is never going to be thought of as being anything close to quality and in fact is not even really worth watching at all.Almost as bad as the Boston Celtics were the year before their NBA Championship season this year, Semi-Pro is nothing more than a bunch of air balls and bricks and Semi-Pro ends up the loser.",2,Will Ferrell Throws an Air Ball with Semi-Pro,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,3502,"['Perhaps', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'evident', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'far', 'better', 'cast', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'actor', 'be', 'quit', 'humorous', 'roles', 'where', 'not', 'lead', 'actor', 'when', 'weight', 'success', 'film', 'Ferrell', 'shoulders', 'falter', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'One', 'really', 'not', 'need', 'look', 'further', 'Taladega', 'Nights', 'realize', 'not', 'enough', 'proof', 'support', 'hypothesis', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'Semi-Pro.Directed', 'Kent', 'Alterman', 'written', 'Scot', 'Armstrong', 'Semi-Pro', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'comedy', 'film', 'stupidity', 'quite', 'well', 'short', 'providing', 'real', 'comedy', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'merely', 'glimmer', 'comedy', 'spread', 'here', 'there', 'film', 'movie', 'really', 'be', 'lot', 'tired', 'old', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'jokes', 'humor.Jackie', 'Moon', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'owner-coach-player', 'American', 'Basketball', 'Association', 'team', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'Tropics', 'Moon', 'sultry', 'R', 'B', 'artist', 'known', 'best', 'song', 'Love', 'Me', 'Sexy', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'being', 'owner', 'coach', 'player', 'professional', 'ABA', 'team', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'basketball', 'prowess', 'catch', 'pass', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'coaching', 'ownership', 'stake', 'more', 'focused', 'coming', 'up', 'witty', 'pre-game', 'introductions', 'running', 'basketball', 'program.Andre', 'Benjamin', 'Outkast', 'fame', 'part', 'Clarence', 'perhaps', 'one', 'finest', 'players', 'Tropics', 'squad', 'However', 'skills', 'being', 'so', 'far', 'others', 'Tropics', 'also', 'constant', 'prized', 'possession', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'basketball', 'teams', 'Clarence', 'change', 'name', 'film', 'Coffee', 'Black', 'nothing', 'really', 'strong', 'peformance', 'Benjamin', 'film.The', 'diamond', 'rough', 'film', 'character', 'Ed', 'Monix', 'played', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Harrelson', 'part', 'washed', 'up', 'former', 'NBA', 'player', 'stints', 'included', 'spending', 'significant', 'time', 'several', 'clubs', 'court', 'mostly', 'bench', 'were', 'not', 'Harrelson', 'performance', 'film', 'entire', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'needed', 'have', 'been', 'ABA', 'are', 'going', 'downsize', 'fold', 'remaining', 'teams', 'NBA', 'owners', 'need', 'come', 'up', 'sort', 'way', 'determine', 'teams', 'will', 'be', 'chopping', 'block', 'will', 'make', 'big', 'time', 'ultimate', 'decision', 'was', 'rendered', 'now', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'Tropics', 'fighting', 'chance', 'make', 'big', 'scene.Moon', 'decides', 'playing', 'certainly', 'not', 'going', 'launch', 'NBA', 'perhaps', 'can', 'reinvigorate', 'fan', 'base', 'Flint', 'series', 'stupid', 'entertainment', 'promotions', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'Moon', 'ideas', 'quite', 'cheesy', 'fact', 'viewer', 'subjected', 'have', 'sit', 'watch', 'ideas', 'come', 'life', 'screen', 'just', 'as', 'cheesy', 'part', 'writer', 'director.Though', 'when', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'involved', 'are', 'not', 'expecting', 'most', 'cinematographic', 'piece', 'excellence', 'Semi-Pro', 'not', 'even', 'deserve', 'be', 'called', 'minor', 'league', 'film', 'Just', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'Tropics', 'were', 'never', 'going', 'make', 'basketball', 'world', 'film', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'thought', 'being', 'anything', 'close', 'quality', 'fact', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'all.Almost', 'as', 'bad', 'Boston', 'Celtics', 'were', 'year', 'NBA', 'Championship', 'season', 'year', 'Semi-Pro', 'nothing', 'more', 'bunch', 'air', 'balls', 'bricks', 'Semi-Pro', 'up', 'loser']",N/A
1154420,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0016MOV92,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 15]","What a dreadfully unfunny comedy! Has Will Ferrell made the circuit of sports he can lampoon yet? Can he move on to some different characters and some different ideas that might make us laugh instead of recycling the same character, the same situations, and the same supporting cast in film after endless film? No, I guess he could do a baseball comedy and a football comedy. Better yet, he could do a comedy about football players who get thrown out of the NFL and decide to start a baseball team, so they can stay together and compete together, maintaining their brotherhood. Jeez. I should just shut up. I have a feeling the new Will Ferrell comedy will be announced tomorrow; a film about baseball players who are banned from the sport and have to form a football team in order to stay together and play together, in order to maintain their brotherhood. Coming Summer, 2009. I just lost some money.""Semi Pro"", the newest Will Ferrell comedy was announced just after the release of ""Blades of Glory"", the more memorable, funnier film starring Ferrell and Jon Heder as rival ice skaters who are forced to compete together against Will Arnett and Amy Poehler's incestuous brother-sister team. At that time, I heard a collective groan. Really? Another sports comedy? Well, calling ""Semi Pro"" a comedy is being far too kind to this film. This film makes ""Blades of Glory"", which has some laughs but is still far from great, look like the comedy equivalent of ""Citizen Kane"".There are a number of things wrong with ""Semi Pro"", but first, a look at the story.Jackie Moon (Ferrell), a disco performer with one hit to his credit, uses that windfall to buy the Flint, Michigan Tropics, a basketball team in the ABA. Jump forward a few years to 1976 and Jackie is excited to learn the ABA will be absorbed into the NBA, but the NBA only wants four teams and the low-attendance Tropics isn't one of them. Jackie gets the owners to agree to let the top four ABA teams go to the NBA, so he returns home and tries to psyche up his bad team. They freely admit they will never reach the top four, but Jackie's confidence is inspiring. He can't let down his rag-tag team of players, including Clarence ""Coffee"" Black (Andre Benjamin) (Har! Har!) and Monix (Woody Harrelson), a player who has seen better days but hungers to get back into the NBA. As soon as Monix arrives back in town, he looks up his old girlfriend, Lynn (Maura Tierney) who is now living with one of Monix's clueless fans, Kyle (Rob Cordry). Then the owners throw in a twist; they will only consider franchises with an average attendance of over 2,000 fans per night. Jackie won't admit defeat and puts together some crazy promotions to lure in the fans.Perhaps the biggest problem with ""Semi Pro"" comes in the filmmakers' conceit that simply dressing the characters up in funny clothes and surrounding them with the icons of the era will make the film funny. The characters do little that would qualify as funny. Apparently, the ABA had a history of staging elaborate and wacky promotions, to lure people into the stadiums. This is the main thrust of the shenanigans Jackie gets involved in. But the set-ups are painful and the comedy falls flat.The characters say virtually nothing, beyond Moon singing his famous song that would qualify as funny. Ferrell plays his stock character, an egotistical blowhard who is desperate to maintain his status and will do anything to make it happen. So Jackie stages elaborate promotions. But his character is simply pathetic and desperate. Because he doesn't realize either, it makes his character sad when the filmmakers probably intended this to create laughs.And the film is rated `R' for language that doesn't make the film particularly biting, funny, or tasteless in a Farrelly Brothers type of way. To simply hear the characters uttering the F Word repeatedly does not make the characters funny. I am having trouble figuring out why this was even done. An `R' rating means a large number of teenage boys who aren't industrious enough to sneak into the theater will not be allowed to see this film. This is Ferrell's core audience and will, no doubt, hurt the film's box office. Because there is no gross out or raunchy humor to justify the `R', what purpose does it serve?Then there is the Will Ferrell problem. With the lone exception of ""Stranger Than Fiction"", Ferrell has been playing the same character since he made his big breakthrough in ""Elf"". In ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Blades of Glory"" he plays essentially the same character; athletes who are so enamored of themselves they do everything they can to stop a potential threat to their current status. Now, with ""Semi Pro"", he adds Jackie Moon to this roster. Each character is remarkably similar; dumb egotistical blowhards who surround themselves with adoring nincompoops. It was mildly funny in ""Talladega Nights"" and mildly amusing in ""Blades of Glory"", but now in ""Semi Pro"" there is a definite `been there, done that' feeling to everything we witness on screen. It just seems so recycled. And boring. I almost long for the days of ""Bewitched"". My body just tremored uncontrollably in horror.How much money does one man need? Hasn't Ferrell collected enough $20 and $30 million dollar paychecks? Ferrell is a funny guy, but he needs to branch out, take some chances, and work with some new people around him. In ""Stranger Than Fiction"" he did just this, and the result was a strange, funny, unusual film. But it didn't make huge box office and I think that was because people are so used to seeing the comedian portray the sports buffoon. When they realized this wasn't going to be a part of ""Fiction"", many people stayed away. But for those who took a chance, along with Ferrell, we were rewarded with a funny, unusual, touching performance in a much underrated film. And the actor also got a chance to work with Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Queen Latifah.I think Ferrell could safely alternate his film choices, and filmmakers would be happy to have him in their projects. He should and could adopt a strategy like many others; make one `box office' picture for every `other' film. So for every ""Semi Pro"", we would get a ""Stranger Than Fiction"". This would lead many more to appreciate Ferrell's work. And his work would become richer due to the exposure to a more diverse group of directors. Just looking at the cast and crew who have worked on his films, you realize he likes to work with friends and people he is familiar with. This is admirable, but when this results in the same film repeatedly, it is time for the comedian to venture a little out of his circle of familiarity.With each of these `sports-themed' comedies, the number of home-runs has dwindled to such a sorry state it is difficult to remember the films at all.",1,Has Ferrell Made The Circuit of Possible Sports Lampoons Yet?,1204848000,"03 7,

It's ideal for if you're bored and looking to kill about an hour and a half. It can be a little vulgar at times (it wouldn't be rated R if it wasn't), so if that's not something you like (I do), then you might want to skip this.I have never really liked Anchorman or Zoolander or movies like that, but for some reason, I like this one. I think it's because it has a bit more heart than those movies. Yeah, they do goofy things, like have all the basketball players dress up for the half-time show and have Will Ferrell try to wrestle a bear, but it's all for a purpose. Everything they do is either to increase ticket sales or try to save their team.

A 2nd-rate movie, really. Seems Ferrell kept the sports-star thing going, which produces some laughs, but the dialogue and plot aren't that great. Most of the fire power comes from ""Ed Monix"", a dedicated, tough-talking experienced player who talks some sense into the ""Flint Tropics"", though the side-plot about him getting back together with his ex makes an hour of tele-commercials exciting.Shame Monix couldn't talk some sense into the turkeys who wrote this thing.

He made a fortune with his one-hit wonder, ""Do Me Sexy"" and used part of his earnings from the song to buy a professional basketball team, the Flint (as in Michigan)Tropics in the American Basketball Association (ABA).  Jackie is the owner, promoter, coach, and one of the team's star players.  All of Jackie's dreams seem to be coming true when at the latest owners meeting it is announced that the NBA is going to merge with the ABA.  However, only the top four teams in the ABA will be enfolded in the new organization and the rest will cease to exist.  Jackie's Tropics have one of the worst records in the ABA and there doesn't seem like there is any way that the Tropics will even finish close to the top four.  After all, Jackie might be the coach and one of the starting players for the Tropics, but he's not a very good coach and is only an average player.  However, Determined not to let his players down or his mama, Jackie sets out to bring about one of the largest turn-arounds in sports history, starting by trading the team's washing machine for one of the former great players of the ABA, Monix (Woody Harrelson).SEMI-PRO starts out promising enough, opening with Will Ferrell singing the song ""Do Me Sexy"" which forces the audience to remember who funny Ferrell can be when he's got great material.  The movie is directed by Kent Alterman and was written by Scot Armstrong, two individuals who have had experience working on past Ferrell movies.  Unfortunately, the film really doesn't live up to expectations.  Instead of being a full-fledged farce, the film turns into a farcical drama.  The cast is rather exceptional, especially Andre Benjamin as Clarence ""Coffee"" Black; I also though Woody Harrelson as Monix and I haven't like anything Harrelson's done since he was Woody on CHEERS.  There are some great laughs in the movie, such as when the team is dressed up in costumes preparing for a halftime musical extravaganza and when Jackie Moon wrestles a real bear.  Yet, overall, much of the humor in SEMI-PRO isn't very funny; there's a lot of stuff that happens that could have been funny, but just isn't.  Instead many of the jokes are just plain stupid and rather lame.Overall, the movie is better Will Ferrell comedy than BLADES OF GLORY, but isn't as good ANCHORMAN or TALLADEGA NIGHTS.  By the way, for a little bit of trivia, all of the team names and uniforms of the teams in SEMI-PRO, except the Flint Tropics, are the same as they were in the real ABA.The special ""Let's Get Sweaty"" DVD version is chock-full of extras.",3,Featuring Jackie Moon and the Tropics,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,2618,"['1976', 'Jackie', 'Moon', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'top', 'world', 'made', 'fortune', 'one-hit', 'wonder', 'Do', 'Me', 'Sexy', 'used', 'part', 'earnings', 'song', 'buy', 'professional', 'basketball', 'team', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'Tropics', 'American', 'Basketball', 'Association', 'ABA', 'Jackie', 'owner', 'promoter', 'coach', 'one', 'team', 'star', 'players', 'Jackie', 'dreams', 'seem', 'be', 'coming', 'true', 'when', 'latest', 'owners', 'meeting', 'announced', 'NBA', 'going', 'merge', 'ABA', 'However', 'only', 'top', 'four', 'teams', 'ABA', 'will', 'be', 'enfolded', 'new', 'organization', 'rest', 'will', 'cease', 'exist', 'Jackie', 'Tropics', 'have', 'one', 'worst', 'records', 'ABA', 'there', ""n't"", 'seem', 'way', 'Tropics', 'will', 'even', 'finish', 'close', 'top', 'four', 'Jackie', 'might', 'be', 'coach', 'one', 'starting', 'players', 'Tropics', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'coach', 'only', 'average', 'player', 'However', 'Determined', 'not', 'let', 'players', 'down', 'mama', 'Jackie', 'out', 'bring', 'about', 'one', 'largest', 'turn-arounds', 'sports', 'history', 'starting', 'trading', 'team', 'washing', 'machine', 'one', 'former', 'great', 'players', 'ABA', 'Monix', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', '.SEMI-PRO', 'out', 'promising', 'enough', 'opening', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'singing', 'song', 'Do', 'Me', 'Sexy', 'audience', 'remember', 'who', 'funny', 'Ferrell', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'got', 'great', 'material', 'movie', 'directed', 'Kent', 'Alterman', 'was', 'written', 'Scot', 'Armstrong', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'experience', 'working', 'past', 'Ferrell', 'movies', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'Instead', 'being', 'full-fledged', 'farce', 'film', 'farcical', 'drama', 'cast', 'rather', 'exceptional', 'especially', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'Clarence', 'Coffee', 'Black', 'also', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Monix', 'have', ""n't"", 'anything', 'Harrelson', 'done', 'was', 'Woody', 'CHEERS', 'are', 'great', 'laughs', 'movie', 'such', 'when', 'team', 'dressed', 'up', 'costumes', 'preparing', 'halftime', 'musical', 'extravaganza', 'when', 'Jackie', 'Moon', 'real', 'bear', 'overall', 'much', 'humor', 'SEMI-PRO', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'lot', 'stuff', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'just', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'many', 'jokes', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'rather', 'lame.Overall', 'movie', 'better', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'comedy', 'BLADES', 'OF', 'GLORY', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'ANCHORMAN', 'TALLADEGA', 'NIGHTS', 'way', 'little', 'bit', 'trivia', 'team', 'names', 'uniforms', 'teams', 'SEMI-PRO', 'Flint', 'Tropics', 'are', 'same', 'were', 'real', 'ABA.The', 'special', 'Let', 'Get', 'Sweaty', 'DVD', 'version', 'chock-full', 'extras']",N/A

The commentators are really forcing these jokes down your throat and it goes down flat.  The characters are hilarious and prove to be great additions. Jackie Moon isn't as suave as Ron Burgundy or as interesting.  He wasn't the focus of the story, however, which is kind of strange.  The rest of the film is funny and in some instances I was crying from laughing so hard.  There are two scenes where it brought the funny and was extremely awesome.  The Russian Roulette scene was nerve racking and funny as hell.  Semi-pro is lacking yet it can be included in the annals of classics such as Ron Burgundy, Old School, A night at the roxburry, and so on.  Just watch it.
