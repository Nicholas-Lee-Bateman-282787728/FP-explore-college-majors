1573343,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B008P9M614,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[20, 22]","HOUSE, M.D. may be the finest dramatic series ever to play on American commercial television, or close to it.  The creators of this eight-year-long Fox show cleverly began with a fusion of medical procedural/forensic themes from earlier hit series (most notably E/R, QUINCY, M*A*S*H and a little CSI), and grafted to it a detective format, but here the culprit is not a murderer but the disease or medical syndrome that's killing this week's patient at busy (albeit fictional) Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey, and has eluded even the best medical attention at that elite institution.  Until, that is, Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) and his team, who are all about diagnostics, get assigned the case.  To reinforce the ""whodunit"" aspect of the show, House's name begins with the same letter as Holmes, Sherlock Holmes, his original address is 221B, and his dispassionate buddy and intellectual foil Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) is gently reminiscent of Dr. Watson, one of the backgrounder goodies pointed out by this boxed set's many bells-and-whistles.Medical mystery brings with it a stiff consortium of medical oddities.  Often, issues that would take top ranking on other medical shows are just part of the passing scene: ectopic pregnancy, Cushing's Syndrome, hemispheric displacement (half of the brain shutting down, or threatening to) and Legionnaire's Disease are among the maladies that have to be dealt with en route to what's REALLY threatening the suffering patient.  HOUSE, M.D.'s writers and producers confess that they and their advisors scour medical literature looking for that true one-in-a-million malady (""If it has happened once, that's validation enough,"" says one producer, ""If it has happened three times in all the literature that may be too much."")  At the center of this series is its offbeat title character, Dr. Gregory House, played to a T, American accent and all, by British actor Hugh Laurie (whom some may remember as upper-class-twit Bertie Wooster in the old ""Jeeves and Wooster"" segments of WOODHOUSE PLAYHOUSE that aired on PBS).  In chronic pain from a thigh disorder, House is a Vicodin addict and a stern taskmaster who walks with a limp, brandishes a cane, and cracks wise so astringently that even Hawkeye Pierce would cringe at some of his insults.  One day he calls a bisexual assistant ""Thirty-One"" instead of her usual nickname ""Thirteen,"" ""Because I thought you liked it both ways.""To be House's colleague or friend is to suffer a constant barrage of insult and other verbal provocation.  Two standouts in the large ensemble cast are Lisa Edelstein, playing administrative head of the hospital Dr. Lisa Cuddy, who mixes erotic tension with perpetual exasperation as House's boss (and gives as good as she gets returning House's scorched-earth wit); and Robert Sean Leonard as Dr. James Wilson, a staff oncologist who plays House's only real friend, a thankless task for the character and a demanding one for the actor, who employs understatement and occasional righteous indignation as the moral center up against House's diagnostic eccentricities and occasional medical excesses (House's ""Jiminy Cricket,"" a writer calls him).  The ever-insecure House is not apt to share.  When House and Wilson move into an apartment together, Wilson expresses a romantic interest in the woman down the hall, but House allows her to think that he and Wilson are a gay couple. Then, when House himself become attracted to her, he takes her to a posh restaurant to seduce her into seducing him at her home.  Wilson, though, crashes the twosome.  On bended knee, he takes out a ring and proposes to House, while an enchanted diner urges, ""Say yes!""  The rest of the ensemble cast is fine as well, though as the series advances and their interactions increase, the ""soap opera"" factor inevitably grows.  Guest stars, who usually bear the brunt of the perplexing diseases at the heart of each plot, are well cast and include Elias Koteas, Howard Hesseman, Mos Def, Cynthia Nixon, Jeremy Renner, Joel Grey, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Candice Bergen.Happily, this show was so generously funded that it boasts production values equal to a feature-length movie, while the dialog and format is as cutting-edge as it gets on TV. (And the visuals -- expect to see blood and urine.)  Following CSI's lead, the show employs video special-effects (VFX) to show what's happening inside the human body.  Season Four, the only season not at full length because of a writer's strike, is nonetheless notable for a two-parter in which a bus crash plays a pivotal role.  No expense was spared, even to the point of constructing an enormous armature to ""roll"" the bus during the accident.  It is around this time that episodes shift from a four- to a six-act structure, allowing for a surprising amount of complexity and subplotting in episodes that run only about forty-five minutes without commercials.  Bells-and-whistles in this boxed set are numerous, including Commentary for some episodes, witness from all major production staff and actors and -- a happy enhancement in a show that, despite the gore, is often as much comedy-drama as comedy -- the occasional scene re-played out in ""Valley Girl"" style complete with accent and slang dialog.  My only complaint is that one of the DVD's had a little dried ""goop"" on it that thoroughly hindered the playing of one episode until it was located and eradicated.  Universal should be more careful.  Still, for 176 episodes the price of this boxed set is a good one, well under half of what downloading episodes piecemeal would cost, and you'll rarely find slack anywhere in the entire eight years.  Highest recommendation.",5,"Really, does it get any better? ...  -",1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,5703,"['HOUSE', 'M.D', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'dramatic', 'series', 'ever', 'play', 'American',

It is hard to believe (as of this writing) it has been a little over a year since the last episode aired. The series is a medical drama but different than ones like St. Elsewhere or ER. Most of it centers on House, a maverick, antisocial doctor with great diagnostic skills who works with a team of three or so. It has been mentioned a number of times during the series that House likes the puzzle more than the patient but I'm not sure he would go to the lengths he does for every patient if he weren't a truly dedicated doctor.I liked House's daily verbal assaults, flouting of hospital rules and general hijinks. House kind of reminds me of what Chef Ramsey would be like if he entered the medical profession. You might think initially that House is easy to analyze but if you watch the entire series, especially with the series finale, you'll see he is a difficult act to follow. I won't spoil anything but I enjoyed the series finale, especially the last five and a half minutes.

1573356,A3ILA7TWINEZ76,B008P9M614,HardToPlease,"[115, 121]","Let's face it, most of us, when buying an entire series, want it to be of high quality, reasonably priced, complete with all episodes and a minimum amount of extraneous &#34;additional&#34; features, i.e. pamphlets, photos and other stuff that may raise the cost of the purchase and which most of us don't want and won't read anyway. I mean, after all is said and done we just want to watch the programs.I have throughly enjoyed this set. The discs were all there when I opened the set (you'd be surprized how often a disc is missing or duplicated leaving the set incomplete) and there was a very brief synopsis of each episode within the DVD case.The subtitles were in English and Spanish and were &#34;almost&#34; verbatim to the dialog unlike some subtitles that I have experienced where the subtitle replaces whole phrases and words and really has nothing to do with what the actor had just said.Disc one of each Season also included &#34;Special Features&#34; for which I can't tell you what the features covered as I don't watch them. Just wanted to mention that they exist.Although there was a small pamphlet contained in the set it was not too burdensome to the reader. One part, &#34;House-isms,&#34; was very funny and I had heard them used, some of them many, many times, throughout the series. The main characters (House, Cuddy & Wilson) comment on their characters character and how they interact with each other. There is also a Season & Episode guide to help you find a special episode without having to open and search each DVD case. There is a section that addresses the ideas of how House was developed as well as how the characters were developed. There are also some quotes, from the famous and not-so-famous. The average time to read the pamphlet is about 20-30 minutes if you stop to think and consider what you've just read :-)Bottom line: House, The Complete Series is well put together and worth the cost. I have recommended this set to several of my friends and family who like this series as much as I do. BUT, I had an ulterior motive for recommending this set so strongly, I don't want to lend my set to ANYONE no matter if they were friend and/or family. To lend this set is just setting me up to have arguments due to a disc being returned with a scratch/scratches, being returned with one or more discs missing or other damage that can happen. So....rather than go through stressful arguments I ALWAYS recommend and  NEVER loan.Just in case I have been too subtle let me just say, BUY  House: The Complete Series!

If you have not seen it yet, read at your own risk...House was witty, acerbic, arrogant, and could get away with saying or doing anything (at least in the early seasons) because he was the best at what he did.  It is how we all wish we could be at work from one time to another. Hugh Laurie played him perfectly.  The balance between the gruff Vicodin addicted doctor who did not care, balanced with the friend and co-worker who really did care deep down.  The diagnosis of the week aspect of the show did get repetitive, even in the first season.  It was basically trying to diagnose a mystery disease, being wrong most of the show, and then House dramatically diagnosing the case at the end of the show.  The real meat of what kept the show on the air for 8 years however, was the character interactions.  The patient cases were, for the most part, just a backdrop.The show kind of fell into the trap of what a lot of ensemble cast series do.  As series regulars leave (or have a reduced role) others step in.  At the end of the third season House lost his original team, and basically had a competition throughout season 4 to replace them (which lead to Kal Penn, Olivia Wilde and Peter Jacobson becoming series regulars).  Of the original group Jennifer Morrison was the only one to truly leave the series and the other two shifted roles throughout the rest of the show, with Jesse Spencer's character (Chase) eventually taking over for House in the last episode.The only story (that was not one of the diagnosis related stories) I did not like is how the show handled Cuddy's exit.  Lisa Edelstein decided to leave the show after season 7.  I think it would have been far more effective to have followed through killing her character off as opposed to her just leaving the hospital because of what House does at the end of that season.  Just having Cuddy up and leave went against everything that the character had done up to that point in her interactions with House.  I think it would have been more effective to have killed off her character, then developed a story where House had to deal with that loss, then done something to end up in jail (that actually made sense).By the 8th season I do think the show had become somewhat stale.  I think having Foreman take over Cuddy's job really underutilized his character, and there were a lot of episodes that season where Omar Epps was only in the show for a couple minutes.  I think the character was always better as a part of House's team, than when they had him as the boss.  I think that the addition of Odette Annable (Odette Yustman for you Cloverfield fans who are in denial about her being married) and Charlene Yi, were good. Even though Olivia Wilde left the show that season (aside from appearances in the early on in the season and the last episode), the fact that Chase and Taub were still around gave it a sense of continuity.  I also really liked Wilson's cancer storyline.  It provided some really good moments without just killing him off in the final episode.  It was also nice how they brought in many of the characters from the past in for the series finale.  I would have liked to see Cameos of Chi McBride's character from season 1 and the Officer from season 3 in the final episode as one of the hallucinations.  But the fact that they got as many people back for the episode as they did was able to give the show a sense of closure.  Having House and Wilson ride off into the sunset at the end was the perfect way for the show to go out.I have the individual seasons (the first 5 on DVD and the last 3 on Blu Ray), not this actual box set.  I know in the season sets, each one has some behind the scenes material and features.  Nothing too extensive on any of them, but good for what they are.

Anyway, I love watching his antics, but mostly how he go about finding solutions to his patients problems, hated he had the drug problem, but that only added to the real world situations that can even happen to so-called pillars of society. It also showed the different aspects of how coping mechanisms come into play from the character himself, his friends, co-workers, employer and even the patients.  But most of all, he was passionate about medicine and he cared, even though he tried to make them think the opposite.  Hey, don't take my word for it, get them and judge for yourself, I truly recommend you do, you might become a &#34;House Fan&#34; too.

So the long, broad line of medical problems this series depicts are really of interest. And the 'tough love' approach of Dr. House is a nice slap of reality for those of us hoping for immediate good news. Morale: True news is best, and cures don't come easy.The only downside is that, aside from different topics, the formats are too the same, the process' differ, but the presentation is consistent, predictible. At least as far as I have viewed - it's a long set, all interesting - I'm not going to rush through them (maybe Amazon could wait a bit before asking for a review...?)The graphics and depictions of very realistic treatments may fascinate or make potential patients queasy. Whatever, they're true (I think) and a needed slap of reality. The CGI graphics for the internal processes are stunning and motivated me to really think what doctors have to face; we humanoids are real complex critters.I think this fine unique dramatic series somewhat on a par with the vivid/ educational/exciting natural visions offered by the BBC.Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series(There is a very long list of nature topics in a variety of individual DVDs; all wonderful.)Steve Martin famously said 'Everything you need to know you can learn from the movies'; these two above sure prove his point...",4,"SMART, FUNNY, EDUCATIONAL AND WITTY FOR ALL AGES ABOVE TEENS (I doubt they'd be interested; thinking they'll live forever)",1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,1368,"[""'m"", '70', 'so', 'seniors', 'know', 'medical', 'issues', 'get', 'be', 'really', 'real', 'long', 'broad', 'line', 'medical', 'problems', 'series', 'depicts', 'are', 'really', 'interest', ""'tough"", 'love', 'approach', 'Dr.', 'House', 'nice', 'slap', 'reality', 'hoping', 'immediate', 'good', 'news', 'Morale', 'True', 'news', 'best', 'cures', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'easy.The', 'only', 'downside', 'aside', 'different', 'topics', 'formats', 'are', 'too', 'same', 'process', 'differ', 'presentation', 'consistent', 'predictible', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'have', 'viewed', 'long', 'set', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'rush', 'maybe', 'Amazon', 'could', 'wait', 'bit', 'asking', 'review', 'graphics', 'depictions', 'very', 'realistic', 'treatments', 'may', 'fascinate', 'make', 'potential', 'patients', 'queasy', ""'re"", 'true', 'think', 'needed', 'slap', 'reality', 'CGI', 'graphics', 'internal', 'processes', 'are', 'stunning', 'motivated', 'really', 'think', 'what', 'doctors', 'have', 'face', 'humanoids', 'are', 'real', 'complex', 'critters.I', 'think', 'fine', 'unique', 'dramatic', 'series', 'somewhat', 'par', 'vivid/', 'educational/exciting', 'natural', 'visions', 'offered', 'BBC.Planet', 'Earth', 'Complete', 'BBC', 'Series', 'very', 'long', 'list', 'nature', 'topics', 'variety', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'wonderful', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'famously', 'said', ""'Everything"", 'need', 'know', 'can', 'learn', 'movies', 'two', 'sure', 'prove', 'point']",House: The Complete Series

Then we have the issue of expensive crappy DVD releases, personally, I hated the cardboard type cases that the first few of these seasons were originally released in, if the button that holds the DVD's in place breaks then you're completely screwed, and $25-40 for each individual set is way to much, but buying all the seasons at one great price (me and my mother got it for slightly over or under $100 with tax) on sale, which was great, especially since they were all in the right type of cases, no individual slim cases or cardboard case, perfect nice plastic ones as it ALWAYS should be in my opinion, not only this, but this comes with all the original special features, which is a HUGE plus!The Show: So, now we come to the show itself... Obviously this show is excellent or I would not have considered getting all the seasons at once, I LOVE Hugh Laurie as House, NOBODY could EVER have played him better, someone you were able to love and hate at the same time yet still care for regardless of the poor choices he makes, the absolute rudeness and disrespect and disregard he has for most human beings in general. I also especially love Dr. James Wilson, House's only true friend.The other doctor's House worked with throughout the show I mostly liked or loved too, there weren't any that I absolutely hated or anything. The romance aspect (mostly all that involved Dr. Cameron) were really against this show, I mean romance is expected in all shows at some point in some way but it just was to much at times, and the worst thing about this series was that it NEVER in my opinion got better after season 3 I think, whenever House started being a ""jerk"" in the truest sense, not his regular, just an outright jerk, the show took the deepest and worst downhill it could have taken, and that lasted a couple seasons, then it picked up slowly and got much, much better.This show while having a truly awful gap between great episodes (or season) for a while is still an excellent show about doctors, patients, medicine, and just one of the greatest TV show characters that has ever been born! The episodes always depicted a patient with an interesting or unique problem and generally with that came an even greater interesting diagnosis, great and memorable characters that we care about and love (or hate) and episodes you can fully invest and engage in with great anticipation, surely a show about medicine and doctors has never and will never again exist.I recommend this show to anyone that loves great TV shows that like with books, you can't wait to see what happens next!House, M.D.: The Complete Series **** out of *****House, M.D.: Season 1 ***** out of *****House, M.D.: Season 2 ***** out of *****House, M.D.: Season 3 ****1/2 out of *****House, M.D.: Season 4 ***1/2 out of *****House, M.D.: Season 5 ***1/2 out of *****House, M.D.: Season 6 ***1/2 out of *****House, M.D.: Season 7 **** out of *****House, M.D.: Season 8 ****1/2 out of *****Violent Content: 8/10 - Violence, Including, Some Graphic Gore During Operation Scenes, Graphic Imagery, and an Attempted Murder, and Some Disturbing Drug Use.Sexuality/Nudity: 4/10 - Some Clothed Brief Sex Scenes and Some Graphic Sexual Dialog.",4,Great set for an overall excellent show!,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,3439,"['Product', 'House', 'M.D', 'show', 'tried', 'stay', 'consistent', 'watch', 'week', 'however', 'life', 'way', 'miss', 'one', 'many', 'important', 'episodes', 'then', ""n't"", 'become', 'priority', 'worth', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'Then', 'have', 'issue', 'expensive', 'crappy', 'DVD', 'releases', 'personally', 'hated', 'cardboard', 'type', 'cases', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'were', 'originally', 'released', 'button', 'DVD', 'place', 'breaks', 'then', ""'re"", 'completely', 'screwed', '25-40', 'individual', 'set', 'way', 'much', 'buying', 'seasons', 'one', 'great', 'price', 'mother', 'got', 'slightly', '100', 'tax', 'sale', 'was', 'great', 'especially', 'were', 'right', 'type', 'cases', 'individual', 'slim', 'cases', 'cardboard', 'case', 'perfect', 'nice', 'plastic', 'ones', 'ALWAYS', 'should', 'be', 'opinion', 'not', 'only', 'original', 'special', 'features', 'HUGE', 'plus', 'Show', 'So', 'now', 'come', 'show', 'Obviously', 'show', 'excellent', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'considered', 'getting', 'seasons', 'once', 'LOVE', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'House', 'NOBODY', 'could', 'EVER', 'have', 'played', 'better', 'someone', 'were', 'able', 'love', 'hate', 'same', 'time', 'yet', 'still', 'care', 'regardless', 'poor', 'choices', 'absolute', 'rudeness', 'disrespect', 'disregard', 'most', 'human', 'beings', 'general', 'also', 'especially', 'love', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Wilson', 'House', 'only', 'true', 'friend.The', 'other', 'doctor', 'House', 'worked', 'show', 'mostly', 'liked', 'loved', 'too', 'were', ""n't"", 'absolutely', 'hated', 'anything', 'romance', 'aspect', 'mostly', 'involved', 'Dr.', 'Cameron', 'were', 'really', 'show', 'mean', 'romance', 'expected', 'shows', 'point', 'way', 'just', 'was', 'much', 'times', 'worst', 'thing', 'series', 'was', 'NEVER', 'opinion', 'got', 'better', 'season', '3', 'think', 'whenever', 'House', 'started', 'being', 'jerk', 'truest', 'sense', 'not', 'regular', 'just', 'outright', 'jerk', 'show', 'took', 'deepest', 'worst', 'downhill', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'lasted', 'couple', 'seasons', 'then', 'picked', 'up', 'slowly', 'got', 'much', 'much', 'better.This', 'show', 'having', 'truly', 'awful', 'gap', 'great', 'episodes', 'season', 'while', 'still', 'excellent', 'show', 'doctors', 'patients', 'medicine', 'just', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'show', 'characters', 'ever', 'been', 'born', 'episodes', 'always', 'depicted', 'patient', 'interesting', 'unique', 'problem', 'generally', 'came', 'even', 'greater', 'interesting', 'diagnosis', 'great', 'memorable', 'characters', 'care', 'love', 'hate', 'can', 'fully', 'invest', 'engage', 'great', 'anticipation', 'surely', 'show', 'medicine', 'doctors', 'never', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'exist.I', 'recommend', 'show', 'anyone', 'great', 'TV', 'shows', 'books', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'House', 'M.D', 'Complete', 'Series', '****', '*****House', 'M.D', 'Season', '1', '*****', '*****House', 'M.D', 'Season', '2', '*****', '*****House', 'M.D', 'Season', '3', '****1/2', '*****House', 'M.D', 'Season', '4', '***1/2', '*****House', 'M.D', 'Season', '5', '***1/2', '*****House', 'M.D', 'Season', '6', '***1/2', '*****House', 'M.D', 'Season', '7', '****', '*****House', 'M.D', 'Season', '8', '****1/2', '*****Violent', 'Content', '8/10', 'Violence', 'Including', 'Graphic', 'Gore', 'Operation', 'Scenes', 'Graphic', 'Imagery', 'Attempted', 'Murder', 'Disturbing', 'Drug', 'Use.Sexuality/Nudity', '4/10', 'Clothed', 'Brief', 'Sex', 'Scenes', 'Graphic', 'Sexual', 'Dialog']",House: The Complete Series
