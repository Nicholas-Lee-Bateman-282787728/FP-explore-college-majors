I have watched a few other Wing Chun videos by different instructors and usually came away disappointed becuase of the low production quality, poor audio, and meandering content (some of them look like they're filmed with home video cameras on the spur of the moment with no planning).  This video is different however.  You can tell that some thought and planning went into how it was laid out, with different sections being announced by a title page, quality narration, and very useful content.  I liked the fact that the video shows you the actual applications behind the techniques in the Siu Nim Tao form.  My appreciation for this form grew greatly after watching the video.  I also liked how he showed the basics of Dan Chi Sao and Chi Sao (Sticking Hands).  It's too bad that Master Wong passed away a few years ago, it would have been nice to see some more quality videos from him (by the way, the end of the video mentions a never-released sequel and even shows some clips of Master Wong doing the Chum Kiu, wooden dummy, &amp; weapons forms; someone should find that stock footage and release it as a new video!).  I bet Wong Shun Leung was a great teacher to those who were lucky enough to have studied under him before his death.

True, if you are an advanced student, you may become bored with the instruction, however, this is the ONLY video of its kind, and i dont know of ANY true wing chun practitioner who wouldnt want this preservation of the late Master Wong shun Leung in their library. i know all of these and i still enjoy watching him in it. please do not become dicouraged from his video because of the FEW bad reviews...just read their complaints! the time frame? the front cover? grow up!!  any rate, this video is a real treasure for any wing chun practitioner-especially beginners. i should point out that at the end the narrator speaks of the next chapter of this video, but it was never produced-this is the only one they completed which i think makes it more special. if you want an intro to wing chun and the first boxing form, this is the video to get!!!!!!!!!!!",5,wing chun-the science of in-fighting...the BEST introduction video to wing chun,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,1345,"['Wing', 'chun-the', 'science', 'in-fighting', 'best', 'introduction', 'wing', 'Chun', 'first', 'form', 'siu', 'nim', 'tao', 'Wong', 'Shun', 'Leung', 'been', 'called', 'one', 'best', 'street', 'fighters', 'world', 'best', 'fighter', 'hong', 'kong', 'good', 'reason', 'won', 'one', 'hundred', 'roof', 'top', 'beimo', 'fights', 'was', 'one', 'Grandmaster', 'Ip', 'Mans', 'top', 'senior', 'students', 'here', 'down', 'movement', 'Siu', 'Nim', 'Tao', 'effectiveness', 'very', 'easy', 'understand', 'fashion', 'beginner', 'True', 'are', 'advanced', 'student', 'may', 'become', 'bored', 'instruction', 'however', 'ONLY', 'video', 'kind', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'ANY', 'true', 'wing', 'chun', 'practitioner', 'who', 'want', 'preservation', 'late', 'Master', 'Wong', 'shun', 'Leung', 'library', 'i', 'know', 'i', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'become', 'dicouraged', 'video', 'FEW', 'bad', 'reviews', 'just', 'read', 'complaints', 'time', 'frame', 'front', 'cover', 'grow', 'up', 'rate', 'video', 'real', 'treasure', 'wing', 'chun', 'practitioner-especially', 'beginners', 'i', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'end', 'narrator', 'speaks', 'next', 'chapter', 'video', 'was', 'never', 'produced-this', 'only', 'one', 'completed', 'i', 'think', 'more', 'special', 'want', 'intro', 'wing', 'chun', 'first', 'boxing', 'form', 'video', 'get']",Wing Chun - Science of In-Fighting VHS
481965,A1EYP32O4MDQJU,6305884129,Christopher Zimmerman,"[93, 99]","I first bought this in VHS format. I loved it so much that I purchased the DVD. Yes, the DVD is much better quality and worth the incredibly fair asking price. ""Wing Chun: The Science of In-Fighting"" is expertly produced and filmed from perfect angles which allows the viewer to accurately discern all the subtle nuances of each move/technique that is shown. Master Cheung is incredible! Obviously an experienced teacher and Wing Chun player. He goes through everything you need to know to get started or brush up your chops in Wing Chun basics. I also appreciate that the techniques are repeated, sometimes in slow motion, which allows for good comprehension without the need for incessant ""rewinding"". All the presented material is extremely solid. Even the background music is perfect in that it keeps the presentation flowing seamlessly. Take my advice and don't listen to the knucklehead who gave this dvd a bad review. Click the link and check out his other reviews. He isn't even into martial arts and probably has never viewed this dvd. Also, I think most people are sick of all the condescending jackasses who keep giving the same advice about not being able to learn martial arts from a book, video, movie or whatever. I think most people who hear this overstated advice think the same thing as if someone had just told them 1 + 1 = 2. MOST, not ALL, people who buy martial arts dvds, books, etc. are TRULY martial artists (who have learned from teachers, lessons, classes, etc.) who use the materials in a variety of ways, i.e. inspiration, further knowledge, comparative analysis, familiarization with different styles, etc., etc., etc. (plus, I wouldn't rule out the possibility that a person could become a self-taught expert... why discourage someone?) Anyway, this dvd is a must-have. I can't say a bad thing about it. Even the added (promotional) material is great. You will enjoy (and learn from) this dvd over and over. It never gets stale. Even though it was created a long time ago it is still on the cutting edge, which is a hallmark of a great effort and true classic.",5,one of the best instructional videos I've ever seen,1095552000,"09 19, 2004",2004,2091,"['first', 'bought', 'VHS', 'format', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'quality', 'incredibly', 'fair', 'asking', 'price', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'Science', 'In-Fighting', 'expertly', 'produced', 'filmed', 'perfect', 'angles', 'viewer', 'accurately', 'discern', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'move/technique', 'shown', 'Master', 'Cheung', 'incredible', 'Obviously', 'experienced', 'teacher', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'player', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'get', 'started', 'brush', 'up', 'chops', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'basics', 'also', 'appreciate', 'techniques', 'are', 'repeated', 'sometimes', 'slow', 'motion', 'good', 'comprehension', 'need', 'incessant', 'rewinding', 'presented', 'material', 'extremely', 'solid', 'Even', 'background', 'music', 'perfect', 'presentation', 'flowing', 'seamlessly', 'Take', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'knucklehead', 'who', 'gave', 'dvd', 'bad', 'review', 'Click', 'link', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'reviews', ""n't"", 'even', 'martial', 'arts', 'probably', 'never', 'viewed', 'dvd', 'Also', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'sick', 'condescending', 'jackasses', 'who', 'keep', 'giving', 'same', 'advice', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'learn', 'martial', 'arts', 'book', 'video', 'movie', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'hear', 'overstated', 'advice', 'think', 'same', 'thing', 'someone', 'had', 'just', 'told', '1', '+', '1', '=', '2', 'MOST', 'not', 'ALL', 'people', 'who', 'buy', 'martial', 'arts', 'dvds', 'books', 'etc', 'are', 'TRULY', 'martial', 'artists', 'who', 'have', 'learned', 'teachers', 'lessons', 'classes', 'etc', 'who', 'use', 'materials', 'variety', 'ways', 'i.e', 'inspiration', 'further', 'knowledge', 'comparative', 'analysis', 'familiarization', 'different', 'styles', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'etc', 'would', ""n't"", 'rule', 'out', 'possibility', 'person', 'could', 'become', 'self-taught', 'expert', 'why', 'discourage', 'someone', 'Anyway', 'dvd', 'must-have', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'thing', 'Even', 'added', 'promotional', 'material', 'great', 'will', 'enjoy', 'learn', 'dvd', 'never', 'stale', 'Even', 'was', 'created', 'long', 'time', 'still', 'cutting', 'edge', 'hallmark', 'great', 'effort', 'true', 'classic']",Wing Chun - Science of In-Fighting VHS

481968,AZXGPM8EKSHE9,6305884129,John,"[7, 7]","Despite the 1960s-type music at the beginning, this is a really excellent DVD on wing chun, with almost nothing extraneous. I keep watching it over and over again, and it really reinforces what I am learing at the wing chun school I attend. The teacher here clearly really knows his art. What I especially like is the slow detailing of each concept, but also they show the applications. For instance, they show sil lim dao (the first form in wing chun), and the next chapter is the ""street application"" of each part of sil lim dao. There is a lot ""hidden"" in wing chun, that you can only see on film (i.e. not from a book), and you get to see it here. Wing chun is really a lot more flexible and also more aggressive than many people think (what I mean by flexible is that, the forms show you the moves, but it is like chess, just because you know the moves individually doesn't mean you can put them together to win a chess match. The application side is how you use the moves, and like chess, it is almost infinite). A lot of people will see something and then say, ""wow I didn't know that was in wing chun"", but it is.

481969,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,6305884129,magellan,"[7, 7]","I have other single and multi-tape sets on Wing Chun and similar topics, including the 8-volume Augustine Fong set, many of Danny Inosanto's instructional videos and seminars, Steve Grody's Jun Fan/Jeet Kune Do set, and others, but this is probably the best single video you can buy on Wing Chun. I agree with Dr. Larry Sanders' comments here in that regard, who says he has 40 years of experience in the martial arts, as I do. This video provides an excellent introduction to the theory, principles, and practice of Wing Chun. The only kung-fu style to be invented by a woman, Wing Chun is a great close-in style, and even if your primary interest is in another percussion art, it makes a great complement to that training as well. I'm primarily a karate and northern Shaolin stylist myself in terms of my kung-fu background, but Wing Chun is a great style also and I enjoy it as well. I believe one should learn both a long-range and short-range punching and kicking art, or a such an art combined with a grappling style for a more complete martial artist. In that regard Wing Chun serves very well, in terms of its simplicity and no-nonsense approach to fighting. Appropros of its simplicity and elegance, it has few katas or forms, and only two weapons forms, a long staff and a double butterfly knife form, and the butterfly knife position never gets reversed, making it even simpler than the other southern styles that use these forms. Wing Chun of course was made famous by being Bruce Lee's style, but Bruce could have done any style and made it look good. But Wing Chun can be practiced by almost anybody, since there are no high or fancy kicks and most of the techniques are hand-oriented. Even their straight punch is simpler than karate, being done with the vertical fist without any rotation. Wing Chun is elegant in its simplicity and there is no better an intro to this important style than this tape.",5,Great single tape,1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,1916,"['have', 'other', 'single', 'multi-tape', 'sets', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'similar', 'topics', 'including', '8-volume', 'Augustine', 'Fong', 'set', 'many', 'Danny', 'Inosanto', 'instructional', 'videos', 'seminars', 'Steve', 'Grody', 'Jun', 'Fan/Jeet', 'Kune', 'Do', 'set', 'others', 'probably', 'best', 'single', 'video', 'can', 'buy', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'agree', 'Dr.', 'Larry', 'Sanders', 'comments', 'here', 'regard', 'who', '40', 'years', 'experience', 'martial', 'arts', 'do', 'video', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'theory', 'principles', 'practice', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'only', 'kung-fu', 'style', 'be', 'invented', 'woman', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'great', 'close-in', 'style', 'even', 'primary', 'interest', 'percussion', 'art', 'great', 'complement', 'training', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'primarily', 'karate', 'northern', 'Shaolin', 'stylist', 'terms', 'kung-fu', 'background', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'great', 'style', 'also', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'believe', 'one', 'should', 'learn', 'long-range', 'short-range', 'punching', 'kicking', 'art', 'such', 'art', 'combined', 'grappling', 'style', 'more', 'complete', 'martial', 'artist', 'regard', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'very', 'well', 'terms', 'simplicity', 'no-nonsense', 'approach', 'fighting', 'Appropros', 'simplicity', 'elegance', 'few', 'katas', 'forms', 'only', 'two', 'weapons', 'forms', 'long', 'staff', 'double', 'butterfly', 'knife', 'form', 'butterfly', 'knife', 'position', 'never', 'reversed', 'making', 'even', 'simpler', 'other', 'southern', 'styles', 'use', 'forms', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'course', 'was', 'made', 'famous', 'being', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'style', 'Bruce', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'style', 'made', 'look', 'good', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'can', 'be', 'practiced', 'almost', 'anybody', 'are', 'high', 'fancy', 'kicks', 'most', 'techniques', 'are', 'hand-oriented', 'Even', 'straight', 'punch', 'simpler', 'karate', 'being', 'done', 'vertical', 'fist', 'rotation', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'elegant', 'simplicity', 'better', 'intro', 'important', 'style', 'tape']",Wing Chun - Science of In-Fighting VHS
