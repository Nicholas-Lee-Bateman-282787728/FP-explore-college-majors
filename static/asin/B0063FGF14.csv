1509109,A2ODRZ9GBMKT51,B0063FGF14,Bigburito,"[2, 2]","I love this series, it's quick, witty, and it has something for both the adults and the children (something that has long been an issue with a lot of tv shows) this dvd is also quite good.first off the price, at $9.99 your getting 5 episodes (6 if you count the bonus episode of pound puppies, a different series, that is included in the bonus features) so it's the price of buying the episodes on itunes (about $2 each episode) this dvd features the first two episodes (a 2-part episode that introduces the characters) along with three episodes that appear to have been selected solely due to the fact that they have trains in them (the insert inside the dvd case advertises a toy train with the ponies which is why I draw this conclusion) but that isn't to say that they're bad, in fact they're all great episodes (the whole show is amazing but I digress) for instance the episode over a barrel is about a group of ponies that plant an apple orchard on the traditional stampeding grounds of a group of buffalo, the two groups bicker which builds up to a large scale battle (involving apple pies mind you) the whole episode flows really well and it has both a lot of great laughs and a solid ending. one episode on this set is actually (in a weird way) controversial. see the series became very popular with older audiences for it's humor (there are references that no child will understand but an adult will completely get and jokes that children will get that parents might not) and one of those humorous bits was a pony named derpy hooves by the fans (it was a background pony that has one eye looking up while the other is looking down, it was originally a flub by an animator who thought the face was going to be obscurred and decided not to fix it but since then the amount of people who enjoyed the specific pony exploded to the point that in other episodes where the pony appeared (with correct eyes) they actually went back and ""derped"" them so that they matched the first episode. it was an interesting instance of where the creators of the show were interacting with the fans. as the show grew bigger and reached an even wider audience the episode the last roundup was released, in it derpy hooves is not only spoken of by name (shortened to Derpy) but she actually has a speaking role with a slightly in-effeminate voice. fans were overjoyed that the character had been portrayed not only as they had expected her to but voiced in a similar way. the problem was that a very small minority of people felt that the character was portrayed as retarded and that it was insulting the mentally disabled. (though to be clear while derp was originally a rude gesture towards the mentally disabled, it has since become almost unknown to that meaning, instead meaning clumsy or ditzy (for instance if you were to bump into a door you'd say derp, at your own clumsiness, it's not a derogatory word anymore, instead just being the new ""butterfingers"") the episode was edited to remove her name, fix her eyes, and change her voice to a more feminine one for the itunes release but this dvd version still contains the unedited original. personally I prefer the original but it might be different for someone with a disabled child or with a different background so I thought I'd mention it.the bonus features are also quite good, there's an extended opening sing-a-long video, profile videos for all the ponies, a printable coloring page, and a bonus episode of the new pound puppies tv show.all in all this is a great set, it's not overly expensive and contains a decent amount of content, and the show itself is quite fun and can be watched over and over without feeling stale.",5,Friendship IS Magic!,1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,3677,"['love', 'series', 'quick', 'witty', 'something', 'adults', 'children', 'something', 'long', 'been', 'issue', 'lot', 'tv', 'shows', 'dvd', 'also', 'quite', 'good.first', 'off', 'price', '9.99', 'getting', '5', 'episodes', '6', 'count', 'bonus', 'episode', 'pound', 'puppies', 'different', 'series', 'included', 'bonus', 'features', 'price', 'buying', 'episodes', 'itunes', '2', 'episode', 'dvd', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', '2-part', 'episode', 'characters', 'three', 'episodes', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'selected', 'solely', 'due', 'fact', 'have', 'trains', 'insert', 'dvd', 'case', 'toy', 'train', 'ponies', 'why', 'draw', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'say', ""'re"", 'bad', 'fact', ""'re"", 'great', 'episodes', 'whole', 'show', 'amazing', 'digress', 'instance', 'episode', 'barrel', 'group', 'ponies', 'plant', 'apple', 'orchard', 'traditional', 'stampeding', 'grounds', 'group', 'buffalo', 'two', 'groups', 'bicker', 'large', 'scale', 'battle', 'involving', 'apple', 'pies', 'mind', 'whole', 'episode', 'really', 'well', 'lot', 'great', 'laughs', 'solid', 'ending', 'one', 'episode', 'set', 'actually', 'weird', 'way', 'controversial', 'see', 'series', 'became', 'very', 'popular', 'older', 'audiences', 'humor', 'are', 'references', 'child', 'will', 'understand', 'adult', 'will', 'completely', 'get', 'jokes', 'children', 'will', 'get', 'parents', 'might', 'not', 'one', 'humorous', 'bits', 'was', 'pony', 'named', 'derpy', 'hooves', 'fans', 'was', 'background', 'pony', 'one', 'eye', 'looking', 'up', 'other', 'looking', 'down', 'was', 'originally', 'flub', 'animator', 'who', 'thought', 'face', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'obscurred', 'decided', 'not', 'fix', 'then', 'amount', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'specific', 'pony', 'exploded', 'point', 'other', 'episodes', 'where', 'pony', 'appeared', 'correct', 'eyes', 'actually', 'went', 'back', 'derped', 'so', 'matched', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'interesting', 'instance', 'where', 'creators', 'show', 'were', 'interacting', 'fans', 'show', 'grew', 'bigger', 'reached', 'even', 'wider', 'audience', 'episode', 'last', 'roundup', 'was', 'released', 'derpy', 'hooves', 'not', 'only', 'spoken', 'name', 'shortened', 'Derpy', 'actually', 'speaking', 'role', 'slightly', 'in-effeminate', 'voice', 'fans', 'were', 'overjoyed', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'portrayed', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'expected', 'voiced', 'similar', 'way', 'problem', 'was', 'very', 'small', 'minority', 'people', 'felt', 'character', 'was', 'portrayed', 'retarded', 'was', 'insulting', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'be', 'clear', 'derp', 'was', 'originally', 'rude', 'gesture', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'become', 'almost', 'unknown', 'meaning', 'instead', 'meaning', 'clumsy', 'ditzy', 'instance', 'were', 'bump', 'door', ""'d"", 'say', 'derp', 'own', 'clumsiness', 'not', 'derogatory', 'word', 'anymore', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'new', 'butterfingers', 'episode', 'was', 'edited', 'remove', 'name', 'eyes', 'change', 'voice', 'more', 'feminine', 'one', 'itunes', 'release', 'dvd', 'version', 'still', 'unedited', 'original', 'personally', 'prefer', 'original', 'might', 'be', 'different', 'someone', 'disabled', 'child', 'different', 'background', 'thought', ""'d"", 'mention', 'it.the', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'extended', 'opening', 'sing-a-long', 'video', 'profile', 'videos', 'ponies', 'printable', 'coloring', 'page', 'bonus', 'episode', 'new', 'pound', 'puppies', 'tv', 'show.all', 'great', 'set', 'not', 'overly', 'expensive', 'decent', 'amount', 'content', 'show', 'quite', 'fun', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'feeling', 'stale']",My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic: The Friendship Express

1509118,AY12DBB0U420B,B0063FGF14,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","My little boy (four years old) enjoys watching cartoons on our wide-screen TV. He has a small library of DVD cartoons, mostly furnished by my wife, and I put one on for him from time to time. One day I was in a nearby Wal-Mart looking over the cheap DVDs and I spotted a few ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoon DVDs. I bought them, remembering how much I enjoyed Tom and Jerry at the movies when I was a kid. Plus, they seemed so much better than the stuff my boy was watching and we could watch them together and both have a laugh. Well, my boy loved them, right from the first play. I was laughing too. I'm not at all surprised. Those old cartoons were just exceptionally well done. Now, when I ask what he wants to watch, he'll request Tom and Jerry. So there!Well, my wife counter-attacked with a ""My Little Pony Friendship is Magic - The Friendship Express"" DVD. I can't stand it. It's the sappiest thing I've ever watched. It's impossible for me to sit through even a few episodes, let alone the whole DVD. Some of the other reviewers remarked about how older children, and even adults, might enjoy watching it along with the younger children. Sorry, that just doesn't work for me. It may be that I'm 76 years old. Yeah, that's probably the reason. I'm in good health and not yet senile enough to enjoy it. Hmmmm. Maybe J've become a curmudgeon.But, wait! The DVD wasn't intended for me, it was for my little boy and he loves it! The DVD immediately catches his attention and holds it all the way through, and that's even after watching it a half dozen times. Why? I don't know why. It's not something I understand. The programming is specifically directed toward young children and evidently the producers seem to really know what they're doing. I'd say the drawings and animations are crude. Most of the lines are too bold and graphic. A lot of the action looks like colored drawings being moved from place to place and photographed. The artwork doesn't appear very sophisticated next to most modern cartoons. But, whatever I might think, the artwork and stories sure capture my boy's attention, The stories about the goings-on in Equestria, or Horselandia, or whatever it's called, are insipid and the voices of the characters grate on my nerves, but they seem just perfect for the little guy. Maybe he likes the bright and vivid colors. That probably helps. Maybe it's the oversized eyes. You know, the music is rather good and maybe that helps too. The boy has always had an ear for music and his taste is rather good, in my opinion. Who knows? In any case, if my boy had a vote, he'd give ""The Friendship Express"" five stars so that's what I'm giving it. Just don't get the idea that I'm sitting around watching it with him and enjoying it.Gary Peterson",5,My Boy Would Give It Five Stars.,1352246400,"11 7, 2012",2012,2753,"['little', 'boy', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'watching', 'cartoons', 'wide-screen', 'TV', 'small', 'library', 'DVD', 'cartoons', 'mostly', 'furnished', 'wife', 'put', 'one', 'time', 'time', 'One', 'day', 'was', 'nearby', 'Wal-Mart', 'looking', 'cheap', 'DVDs', 'spotted', 'few', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'cartoon', 'DVDs', 'bought', 'remembering', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'movies', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'seemed', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'stuff', 'boy', 'was', 'watching', 'could', 'watch', 'together', 'have', 'laugh', 'Well', 'boy', 'loved', 'right', 'first', 'play', 'was', 'laughing', 'too', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'old', 'cartoons', 'were', 'just', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'Now', 'when', 'ask', 'what', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'request', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'So', 'there', 'Well', 'wife', 'counter-attacked', 'Little', 'Pony', 'Friendship', 'Magic', 'Friendship', 'Express', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'sappiest', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'impossible', 'sit', 'even', 'few', 'episodes', 'let', 'alone', 'whole', 'DVD', 'other', 'reviewers', 'remarked', 'how', 'older', 'children', 'even', 'adults', 'might', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'younger', 'children', 'Sorry', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'may', 'be', ""'m"", '76', 'years', 'old', 'Yeah', 'probably', 'reason', ""'m"", 'good', 'health', 'not', 'yet', 'senile', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'Hmmmm', 'Maybe', 'J', ""'ve"", 'become', 'curmudgeon.But', 'wait', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'intended', 'was', 'little', 'boy', 'DVD', 'immediately', 'attention', 'way', 'even', 'watching', 'half', 'dozen', 'times', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'not', 'something', 'understand', 'programming', 'specifically', 'directed', 'young', 'children', 'evidently', 'producers', 'seem', 'really', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', ""'d"", 'say', 'drawings', 'animations', 'are', 'crude', 'Most', 'lines', 'are', 'too', 'bold', 'graphic', 'lot', 'action', 'colored', 'drawings', 'being', 'moved', 'place', 'place', 'photographed', 'artwork', ""n't"", 'appear', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'next', 'most', 'modern', 'cartoons', 'might', 'think', 'artwork', 'stories', 'sure', 'capture', 'boy', 'attention', 'stories', 'goings-on', 'Equestria', 'Horselandia', 'whatever', 'called', 'are', 'insipid', 'voices', 'characters', 'grate', 'nerves', 'seem', 'just', 'perfect', 'little', 'guy', 'Maybe', 'bright', 'vivid', 'colors', 'probably', 'Maybe', 'oversized', 'eyes', 'know', 'music', 'rather', 'good', 'maybe', 'too', 'boy', 'always', 'had', 'ear', 'music', 'taste', 'rather', 'good', 'opinion', 'Who', 'case', 'boy', 'had', 'vote', ""'d"", 'give', 'Friendship', 'Express', 'five', 'stars', 'what', ""'m"", 'giving', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'idea', ""'m"", 'sitting', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'it.Gary', 'Peterson']",My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic: The Friendship Express
1509119,AA0N0BG2CPY6N,B0063FGF14,Japanese Teeth,"[5, 6]","This is gonna be long.  I'm going to talk about the show in general, then move to this DVD in particular.  If the wall of text is too much, just jump to the 2 sentence summary at the bottom.If you've spent much time on the internet lately, you're probably aware that the latest incarnation of the My Little Pony franchise, Friendship is Magic, has become something of a sensation online, and with good reason.  It's certainly true that popularity doesn't equal quality, but in this case the show definitely deserves the attention.  While it's probably not the ""BEST SHOW EVER"" or some spectacular work of art as some fans will try to pass it off as, the fact of the matter is that it's good.  Very very good.The secret to it's success is that despite being very obviously targeted at young girls, it's so tightly written and well animated that adult males like myself can watch and enjoy it without cringing.  Yes, it can be sappy at times, but it's leagues ahead of most other children's animation targeted at girls.  In short, FIM's greatest asset is it's accessibility.  The characterization is stellar; all of the primary characters are surprisingly well-rounded and complex, and even when they get into conflicts, they manage to be believable.  The humor is universal; there's some slapstick, but most of the comedic moments are situational or character based rather than the ""gross-out"" style of humor that's so prevalent in animation today.  I don't know much about animation, but even so I can safely say that the show looks gorgeous, and the characters are amazingly expressive.The basic plot of the show is that an overly studious unicorn named Twilight Sparkle (the personal student of Princess Celestia) and her assistant (a baby dragon named Spike), , ends up moving to the small town of Ponyville, so she can study ""the magic of friendship"" with her new friends: Pinkie Pie (who absolutely loves to throw parties), Rarity (a unicorn who owns her own fashion boutique), Applejack (who works at and runs an apple farm), Fluttershy (a shy winged pony who loves animals), and Rainbow Dash (a more rambunctious winged pony tasked with running the weather).  Every episode she (or in the second season, one of the other ponies) has to send a ""friendship report"" to the Princess about what she's learned.  There's much more to it than that, but saying exactly how it happens would be a spoiler.  Now while this whole thing sounds incredibly sappy on paper, the show pulls it off amazingly well.While it should be incredibly cringe-inducing, FIM gets away with it by virtue doing everything with a wink to the audience.  When Twilight first gets her assignment to study ""the Magic of Friendship"", she's every bit as skeptical of the idea as the audience probably is.  When Pinkie Pie randomly bursts into song, the other characters roll their eyes.  The writers are well aware of the inherent sugariness of the premise.  Even the stereotypical ""girly"" aspects of the show get a bit of an overhaul; yes, Rarity is into fashion and is obsessed with ""fabulosity"", but she's first and foremost an artist, who just so happens to use fabric as her medium.  Even if you have no interest in clothes, you can sympathize with her as artist.  Finally, the FIM's greatest strength: It doesn't treat the audience like idiots.  Most children's programming seems to dumb everything down.  FIM doesn't.  The plots are simple enough for a child to follow, but there's enough depth to the characters that the adults can watch along and not feel insulted.  And over the course of the series, there are all sorts of shout-outs to adult viewers (for example a recent episode, not on this dvd, introduced a superhero-like character whose costume rather strongly resembles Darkwing Duck, another character uses Spider-Man's catchphrase, etc.)So taken as a whole, the show is amazing.  Does it have its flaws?  Of course, but every show has problems.  For what it is, it manages to be great.  The writing is good, the voice acting is good, the animation is beautiful, and the morals are (generally) solid across the board.Now, onto the DVD:First off, as of the time of this writing ""The Last Roundup"" hasn't actually aired yet, so I have no idea of the quality of that episode.  As such, I'll be focusing on the other four that I'm also familiar with.  Also, this is solely about the quality of the episodes; I have no clue about the quality of the DVD itself.  Also also, the episodes are not in order; well they kind of are, but they're taken from across both seasons rather than starting at the beginning and working through.  The first two episodes are the pilot episodes, the third is from near the end of the first season, the fourth is halfway into the 2nd season, and the fifth hasn't even aired yet.I have to admit, I almost knocked this review down to 4 stars because of the selection of episodes; I really don't think they picked the strongest set to lead off of.  However, even if they aren't the best the series has to offer, they're good enough that the DVD is totally worth buying anyway, especially as it's solely my opinion of the episodes.- ""Mare in the Moon"" and ""Elements of Harmony"" were no brainers; they're the first two episodes of the series, and they introduce the setting and the characters.  They aren't fully indicative of the rest of the series, (these are more adventure oriented while most other episodes are more Slice Of Life) but they're a good starting point.- ""Over a Barrel"" is a mixed bag; it has a very heavy emphasis on guest characters and takes place in a different setting than the rest of the series.  None of this is bad, but the primary cast isn't in the spotlight.- ""Hearth's Warming Eve"" is a great episode, but it's an odd choice for this dvd.  It features the cast putting on a play about the history of Equestria, and as a result they're ""in-character"" most of the time.  It's a lot more interesting if you're already familiar with the cast.So basically, while the episodes are all good, they aren't really indicative of how the show typically is.But anyway, that's really a minor nitpick.  If you've already seen the show and like it, buy the DVD and support it.  If you haven't, buy it anyway, because while it's not ideal, it's still really good.  If you're buying it for your kids, buy it, because they'll probably enjoy the cute ponies without worrying about all the other stuff I mention.  So if you have any interest in the show, you should pick up the DVD.  It's a good value, and the more of these we buy, the more likely we'll get more DVDs.Summary: The show has a high-enough level of quality that even if you're nowhere near the target audience, you can still enjoy it.  ""The Friendship Express"" doesn't have the best selection of episodes (at least in my opinion), but it's still totally worth buying.",5,"Great show, good dvd, worth picking up",1324339200,"12 20,

1509120,AY5XWJE0LEYB8,B0063FGF14,jasmine garcia,"[0, 1]","As the snow falls in a distant town, the evening draws near and the shops get ready to close. However, the coffeehouse seems to be still open, but empty. The owner is getting ready to close up shop, but he seems a bit nervous like he's waiting for something to happen before he closes. Suddenly, the door cracks, and Butch and Cassidy walk in, disguised. They happen to be rather familiar to the owner. As they make their specifically vivid order (Parfait Special with an addition), the owner recognizes them immediately, almost as if they're talking in some kind of code, and gives them the order. As B&C; sit down to eat it, they wolf it down, and on the last spoonful they find a radio chip with a message. Apparently the owner of the coffeehouse is a secret agent as well, and Dr. Namba had sent them there to make that exact order as a signal for him. As they play Dr. Nanba's message, similar to before with Delcatty, an illusion image of a Luvdisc appears. In the message, Dr. Nanba tells them that he's after the &#34;Rendezvous Pokemon&#34; Luvdisc, and that as far as he knows, their best bet is to go to the Cerulean City Gym (how does he know this stuff anyway?). B&C; are well familiar with the Cerulean Gym, as are they with its leader, Misty, who has ruined their plans. It's payback time!Currently, while Misty is in charge of the Cerulean Gym, Daisy has returned from her trip and is there to play substitute or janitor. Ding-dong! They've got a visitor, and it's none other than their good friend Tracey Sketchit. As Misty greets him, he says that while at Oak's, he'd gotten an invitation from her sister Daisy to the Gym. He heard that she wants to show him some kind of new Pokemon. First of all, he asks how the other sisters, Lily and Violet are doing. Misty tells him that they haven't been around much, as Violet's been spending most of her time getting her hair done at the local salon, and Lily has been getting massages at the local chiropractor.Suddenly, Daisy notices from the other room that Tracey's finally here, and excitedly greets him, referring to him as &#34;the prince&#34; and drags him to the aquarium room. There, she shows him the Rendezvous Pokemon, Luvdisc. As he observes and sketches it, Daisy explains that recently, she and Misty had each captured a Luvdisc, in hope of using it for the next big show. This one is Misty's Luvdisc, Kasurin, and she's very proud of it. Suddenly, Tracey notices it turn its head. As a Pokemon Watcher, he figures this must mean something important, like it's after someone. They both explain that it's attracted to Daisy's Luvdisc, Raburin. Suddenly, Tracey notices Raburin (with a crown) nearby in the tank, just as Kasurin gets a romantic look and starts to lust after it, Raburin followed. Daisy gloats about how she's proud of Raburin's pimping skills. However, the news is broken later when Kasurin goes up to it and starts flirting, Raburin rejects it and swims off.As Kasurin sulks, heartbroken, Misty explains that this is part of the reason Misty and Daisy needed Tracey, to figure out why exactly Raburin isn't interested, being a Pokemon Watcher and all. Daisy then explains that they need them to be able to get along well for a show, but having called Tracey, she now explains that she also wants him and Misty to play the prince and the mermaid princess in her next show, hence the address earlier. Tracey sighs, not being aware that this was part of the reason she lured him here. The problem is that the Luvdiscs are supposed to kiss and create an Attract, but they can't seem to get along very well. Of course, it seems a little strange to Misty and Tracey, since they see each other as just friends, but after all, this would just be a show. However, Daisy seems to be taking this a little too far and going on, but eventually they get back on topic, to Raburin and Kasurin, and getting them to like each other. Suddenly, out of Misty's bag comes our old friend Psyduck, splashing about in the water. Misty throws him a life saver, but just then they get an idea. Raburin and Kasurin swim up to the surface, and the three watch as Psyduck floats between them. It seems Kasurin is up first and explains to Psyduck about its unrequited love. Never trust Psyduck for a matchmaker. As Raburin swims up, Psyduck asks about why it doesn't like Kasurin, and gets shot down with a Water Gun. Kasurin starts crying, and then they realize that they shouldn't have trusted Psyduck.Suddenly, underwater, unbeknownst to them, a small trap pod is floating around, within seconds capturing Raburin! The trio then notice, as a sub pops out of the water, revealing Butch and Cassidy. After the motto and confrontation, Cassidy sends out Sableye who hurls a Shadow Ball at them, filling the area with smoke. As it clears, B&C; escape the Gym with Raburin, and drive off in their pod just before Misty, Daisy, and Tracey catch them.Before they start chasing them, Tracey gets an idea. Perhaps they should bring Kasurin and have it help save Raburin and win its love. They all like the idea, and fill a small tank with water and bring Kasurin along for the road. Kasurin seems to still be a bit sad from the rejection to cooperate, but upon hearing the plan, it gives in.Daisy has never really driven, but this is an emergency. She's a bit excited to go driving for the first time, so she puts on her sunglasses and does an excitement pose. As they rev up the engine, Daisy feels like a pro with the wind in her hair, and they eventually catch up to B&C.; However, they seem to notice they caught up in the rearview mirror. Butch tries to speed, but unfortunately this is the fastest. Daisy eventually catches up to them and yells to give Raburin back, but of course that's a hopeless case. Suddenly, they start going too fast and pass them, and Daisy has trouble remembering how to stop. Eventually she slams down on the brakes, skidding to a stop. However, B&C; aren't too far behind, and their pod is also a water proof sub, so they jump off and escape into the water!Their car is not water proof, but they do have a small raft. However, they need to inflate it. With all his might, Tracey pumps it up as fast as he can, and manages to finish as they head into the water with it. Unfortunately, Daisy doesn't have much experience controlling one of these either, and rapids shake them up. Luckily, they make it to a group of rocky islands. Kasurin is getting a little queasy in there, but Misty reminds it that this is to save Raburin and win its heart, and manages to calm Kasurin down. Daisy then notices a rocky island bigger than the others, with a cave, and figures that this must be the perfect place for the famous local TR hideout, so they go check it out&#8230;So it is. B&C; are in there, watching the screen. Sure enough, they notice the raft there, and wondering if it's really possible that they found the secret hideout.As they get out and try to find them, a panel opens behind them as a giant arm reaches out, grabbing Kasurin's tank! It manages to lift Tracey, who is carrying it, but he can't bear it and lets go. In that time, a trapdoor opens under them, and they fall. As they get up, they hear a familiar laughter, and realize that B&C; are behind this as well, and now have Kasurin! A hidden door then opens, revealing the duo and their tank which Raburin and Kasurin are held hostage in!While B&C; go to report this to Namba (leaving the tank there as it's too heavy and they will be back in a few minutes), Misty and the others worry a bit, while Tracey wishes Oak was there to help. However, Misty has a plan. She can communicate to the Luvdiscs in the tank, so she does just that. Pointing at the skylight above the tank, she tells Kasurin to jump up as hard as it can to Tackle the cage open, and then somehow hit the skylight open. It's very high, and Kasurin is a little wimpy to do it, but Misty gets frustrated and reminds it that being a quitter won't get any affection out of Raburin. Looking at Raburin, it decides to give in and jump-tackle it. To no avail, he bumps the bars, which remain rock solid. A few more failing attempts with all of his might determine him more, as Raburin has her attention focused on Kasurin. Kasurin cannot give up in front of Raburin, although Raburin is starting to get a little nervous that Kasurin will hurt himself, even though she knows he's trying to impress her.Finally, Kasurin manages to break the cage open (and yes, Raburin is relieved), and now it's time to take care of the skylight! Misty has Kasurin try his Water Gun on it, but it remains tight in there. However, a deeper breath of it sends the glass out the window, opening the skylight for escape!Their troubles are not over. Suddenly, the alarm goes off, alerting B&C; of the recent happening. Quickly, they make their way to the scene&#8230;Now it's Raburin's turn to act. Daisy has her shoot a Water Gun out through the hole, while Misty has Kasurin use its Ice Beam to freeze the arch of water Raburin is making! Sure enough, it works, and now they just have to climb out. But just then, B&C; arrive on the scene, and Butch opens the trap for them, all over again! Thinking fast, Misty has Kasurin use Double Team, confusing Butch in controlling the machine to catch the right one. While he fumbles with the controller, R&K; use this as a chance to escape by climbing the arch. While Butch's still fumbling, Cassidy climbs out after them, alerting him of the situation to drop it and follow (how it manages to not break is beyond me).As the two discus fish bounce across the hills and valleys, they eventually find themselves cornered at a cliff with nowhere to run, B&C; trailing them. As they approach, Kasurin things fast, motions for Raburin to kiss him. Of course, she's a slight bit reluctant, but she trusts him enough as a friend. Slowly, the two fish begin to make out&#8230; and B&C; are too shocked to make any moves, oohing and awing at the incredibly cute scene. But with their lips locked in place, they jump off the cliff, and form a &#34;butterfly&#34;, enabling them to use their bodies as wings and glide down slowly, and safely. Clever Kasurin, thinking of a plan to score a bit.As they land, they look at each other in acknowledgement, and it seems Kasurin has finally won the love of Raburin. Back inside the cave, Tracey has managed to grab hold of the trap pod controller which Butch forgot, and stands back with the others as he self-destructs it. Time to round up the Luvdisc and head back to the Gym!Or not. While the couple swim towards Cerulean City, a fence pops up in the water in front of them. They assume it's just a dam, so they head back to find another way&#8230; but another fence has popped up, and as they look up, they realize B&C; still haven't given up! This time they send out their Pokemon, Sableye and Mightyena as Kasurin sprays Butch in the face. That doesn't threaten them, so Cassidy has Sableye go for the Fury Swipes&#8230; but unfortunately, it can't physically attack them, since it's gravitated and can't swim! Butch then pushes a button, making the fences close in. Then, it's about to have Mightyena do something, but the calls of Misty and the others distract them. As they couple notice them, just as the fences are about to crush them into a valentine cookie, they jump out at the last second. Misty and Daisy then quickly discuss among themselves a plan to get rid of them, and when ready, Daisy has Raburin hold Kasurin up with her Water Gun. Mightyena tries attacking them with Iron Tail, but just then Kasurin jumps off Raburin's geyser and stops it with Water Gun yet again. Sableye then hurls a Shadow Ball at them, but R&K; think fast and use the Water Gun/Ice Beam combo again, freezing the shadow ball in place! B&C; are amazed and worried at this strategy, as they're worried about the Shadow Ball exploding once unfrozen. Butch tries to destroy it as soon as possible by having Mightyena hit it (as well as them) with a Hyper Beam, but Daisy has Raburin use Sweet Kiss, charming Mightyena and distracting it, before it fires the beam while it still glows at the mouth. As Mightyena swaggers about with a mouth glowing with a Hyper-Beam-to-be, it happens to spit it out in the direction of B&C.; To finish this off, Misty and Daisy have both their fish use a combined Water Gun, blasting them both off. The Sweet Kiss effect seems to have rubbed off on Sableye too, and it and Mightyena playfully lick and hug each other as they blast through the air.Back at the Gym, the show seems to be quite a big success. Of course, they don't need Misty and Tracey anymore now that the feeling is mutual with the Luvdisc as it is. Also, it seems Daisy has added an unexpected last bit into the script (might have not been there to begin with), as the Luvdisc spray the audience with Sweet Kiss. All the couples that went to see the show now feel the love stronger than ever, and applaud as the curtains close and Daisy thanks Misty and Tracey for their help.",5,a luvdisc is a crazy

1509128,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B0063FGF14,Theo,"[6, 9]","Let's face it: if a cartoon is based on a line of toys, generally speaking that's not a good sign. A few such shows, like the original He-Man, acquire a certain ignominious cult following in the ""so bad it's good"" category. Seriously, that one had to be far and away the campest children's show ever made...But, I digress.This, the latest incarnation in the My Little Pony franchise, does not fall into the ""so bad it's good"" category. It's just good. Really good. Smart, too.On a superficial level the tried and true formula remains unchanged. Candy-bright characters and sickly-sweet morality tales parade across our screens, preaching the same tired old lessons kids have rammed down their throats in so many other shows. Poor devils.The good part comes in the delivery. The writing, the voice acting, and the artwork are all genuinely witty, and everything is handled with a certain deft panache. Without being in any way hard or cynical, much less descending into mere self-parody, beneath the surface the underlying sensibilities are actually rather grown-up. There's a definite feeling of adults at play here, of a show created by people who genuinely had a lot of fun in making it. Perhaps as a result there's a real lightness of touch, and both the show itself and the individual characters are all utterly charming. It's sweet, but not saccharine.For us, the humble viewers, the funniest parts by far are when the ponies totally freak out and ""lose it"". I've put ""lose it"" in quotation marks because it actually is a quote. I first found my way to this show via a clip on YouTube entitled ""Pinky Pie Loses It"". There's also a host of other similar clips from the show that have been uploaded to that site. So if you've not seen this cartoon before and would like to get a feeling for why it has the cult following it does, the best advice I can give you is to stop reading reviews here on Amazon and go look at some of those clips for yourself.One last thing: This show really deserves five stars. My four star rating is due solely to the nature of the DVD release. Unfortunately we're still at the stage in the marketing process where the vendors are selling DVDs with just a handful of episodes apiece.Nuts to that.I've no intention of buying this product. I'm going to wait until the show comes out in whole seasons.Theo.",4,Edgy Cute,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,2334,"['Let', 'face', 'cartoon', 'based', 'line', 'toys', 'generally', 'speaking', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'few', 'such', 'shows', 'original', 'He-Man', 'acquire', 'certain', 'ignominious', 'cult', 'following', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'category', 'Seriously', 'one', 'had', 'be', 'far', 'away', 'campest', 'children', 'show', 'ever', 'made', 'digress.This', 'latest', 'incarnation', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'franchise', 'not', 'fall', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'category', 'just', 'good', 'Really', 'good', 'Smart', 'superficial', 'level', 'tried', 'true', 'formula', 'unchanged', 'Candy-bright', 'characters', 'sickly-sweet', 'morality', 'tales', 'parade', 'screens', 'preaching', 'same', 'tired', 'old', 'lessons', 'kids', 'have', 'rammed', 'down', 'throats', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'Poor', 'devils.The', 'good', 'part', 'delivery', 'writing', 'voice', 'acting', 'artwork', 'are', 'genuinely', 'witty', 'everything', 'handled', 'certain', 'deft', 'panache', 'being', 'way', 'hard', 'cynical', 'much', 'less', 'descending', 'mere', 'self-parody', 'surface', 'underlying', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'actually', 'rather', 'grown-up', 'definite', 'feeling', 'adults', 'play', 'here', 'show', 'created', 'people', 'who', 'genuinely', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'making', 'Perhaps', 'result', 'real', 'lightness', 'touch', 'show', 'individual', 'characters', 'are', 'utterly', 'charming', 'sweet', 'not', 'saccharine.For', 'humble', 'viewers', 'funniest', 'parts', 'far', 'are', 'when', 'ponies', 'totally', 'freak', 'out', 'lose', ""'ve"", 'put', 'lose', 'quotation', 'marks', 'actually', 'quote', 'first', 'found', 'way', 'show', 'clip', 'YouTube', 'entitled', 'Pinky', 'Pie', 'also', 'host', 'other', 'similar', 'clips', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'uploaded', 'site', 'So', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'cartoon', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'feeling', 'why', 'cult', 'following', 'best', 'advice', 'can', 'give', 'stop', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'go', 'look', 'clips', 'yourself.One', 'last', 'thing', 'show', 'really', 'five', 'stars', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'due', 'solely', 'nature', 'DVD', 'release', 'Unfortunately', ""'re"", 'still', 'stage', 'marketing', 'process', 'where', 'vendors', 'are', 'selling', 'DVDs', 'just', 'handful', 'episodes', 'apiece.Nuts', 'that.I', ""'ve"", 'intention', 'buying', 'product', ""'m"", 'going', 'wait', 'show', 'out', 'whole', 'seasons.Theo']",My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic: The Friendship Express
1509129,A2ZTXNJTXV0Y83,B0063FGF14,WOLVERINE,"[0, 0]","I am one of the converted. The first season that aired on the Hub I completely missed in original airings, having grown up with the original MLP in the 80s and thinking this would be more of the same fluffy girly stuff. But, catching a chance rerun while waiting for another show changed my mind.Lauren Faust had taken the concept of MLP and turned it on its ears, introducing character development, well-written stories, moral lessons that aren't heavy-handed, and legitimate comedy. It's easy to see why so many adults fell in love with this show, because it embraces the one golden rule of entertainment: don't talk down to your audience. Like the classic cartoons of yesteryear, it's great for kids while also being enjoyable for adults. And, despite being based on a product geared towards girls, it really comes off as more gender-neutral, which is a tremendous plus as anyone can enjoy it.This DVD, while not having the best episodes of the series, definitely has a nice sampling of the show from the first two seasons. If anything, this DVD is worth getting if for nothing more than the unaltered version of ""The Last Roundup."" More on that below.Friendship is Magic is the two part series premiere which shows Twilight Sparkle, apprentice to Princess Celestia, being sent to Ponyville to learn the importance of friendship. There, she meets and befriends Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rarity and Rainbow Dash. Together, they represent the elements of harmony and use them to defeat the evil Nightmare Moon.Over A Barrel was a controversial episode because of its depiction of the cowboys vs. Indians conflict throughout history. The ponies journey to Appleloosa where the settler ponies' apple orchard is planted right in the path of the buffalo's migration path, and they demand their removal. After a short conflict, a compromise is reached that appeases all parties. So, what's so offensive about this episode? Many feel the genocide faced by the Indians was trivialized in its toned down representation in this episode as a pie fight.Hearth's Warming Eve is the ponies' version of Christmas. The ponies all participate in a play revealing the origin of Hearth's Warming Eve: when all the different pony tribes (earth, magic and pegasi) had to overcome their differences to create Equestria.The Last Roundup is another controversial episode. Applejack heads off to compete in a rodeo, but when she fails to achieve the success she's had in prior years she decides to stay away from Ponyville after all the fuss they made over her at her departure. But, her friends go after her to try and understand why she hasn't come home and get her back. So, why the controversy? In the first episode of the series, a background pony was accidentally given crossed eyes, which fans latched on to and ate up, creating the fan-favorite character Derpy Hooves. Derpy continued to appear in episodes, either in the background or as part of a sight gag. It wasn't until this episode that producers decided to give a nod to the fans by not only naming her, but giving her lines. Unfortunately, the name, coupled with the eyes, her klutzy behavior, and the voice Tabitha St. Germain chose to give her (not knowing it was a girl, she based it on her neighbor's kid, a boy). That all led to people misinterpreting the character as a sleight on mentally handicapped people and caused an over reactive outcry to follow. As a result, that scene was altered with new dialogue and no name. This DVD is now the only place, besides Youtube, to see the unaltered episode.If you or your kids are not watching this show, then you're really missing out. The stories are well-written, the characters are fun, and there are great jokes to be be found. Pinkie Pie's antics alone are worth the price of admission.
