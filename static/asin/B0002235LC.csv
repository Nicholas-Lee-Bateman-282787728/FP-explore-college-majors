821268,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B0002235LC,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","If you thought that the black bouncer at Blue Iguana looked familiar, then you are right. It is Djimon Hounsou, who had a well-known role in Amistad. Anyway, I enjoyed the pilot episode of Beverly Hills 90210, and it does bring back good memories. And also, it's the beginning of everything. For a strange moment, I kept thinking that the show would start in Minneapolis first, but that never did happen. Catching the perpetrator who wrecked his vette, why would Steve Sanders offer 50 bucks as a reward? That's way too low, and he could have offered more for faster results. The lawyer Jason did the right thing because the key word is ""statutory rape."" had Brenda let the lie go on too long, Jason would have been disbarred, sent to prison, and lost everything that he worked for. So, he had the right to feel the way he did. Brandon's punishment was totally uncalled for, and it was a pretty much of a poor reaction to a small slip of his tongue. However, Brandon should be lucky in this situation because he gets to find out what kind of a girl Marianne is like: a spoiled person without limits. The fashion of West Beverly High is interesting because it looked so bad for people who have boatload of money. I expected more, but that's all right...it's still the 80s. Brian Austin Green, making his debut in the pilot episode, will show a very remarkable transformation in the later episodes. On the other hand, the DVD works just fine, it's exactly as I expected, and it's very bare bones.",5,The beginning of the everything.,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,1494,"['thought', 'black', 'bouncer', 'Blue', 'Iguana', 'looked', 'familiar', 'then', 'are', 'right', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'who', 'had', 'well-known', 'role', 'Amistad', 'Anyway', 'enjoyed', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'bring', 'back', 'good', 'memories', 'also', 'beginning', 'everything', 'strange', 'moment', 'kept', 'thinking', 'show', 'would', 'start', 'Minneapolis', 'first', 'never', 'did', 'happen', 'Catching', 'perpetrator', 'who', 'wrecked', 'vette', 'why', 'would', 'Steve', 'Sanders', 'offer', '50', 'bucks', 'reward', 'way', 'too', 'low', 'could', 'have', 'offered', 'more', 'faster', 'results', 'lawyer', 'Jason', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'key', 'word', 'statutory', 'rape', 'had', 'Brenda', 'let', 'lie', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'Jason', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disbarred', 'sent', 'prison', 'lost', 'everything', 'worked', 'So', 'had', 'right', 'feel', 'way', 'did', 'Brandon', 'punishment', 'was', 'totally', 'uncalled', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'poor', 'reaction', 'small', 'slip', 'tongue', 'However', 'Brandon', 'should', 'be', 'lucky', 'situation', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'kind', 'girl', 'Marianne', 'spoiled', 'person', 'limits', 'fashion', 'West', 'Beverly', 'High', 'interesting', 'looked', 'so', 'bad', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'boatload', 'money', 'expected', 'more', 'right', 'still', '80s', 'Brian', 'Austin', 'Green', 'making', 'debut', 'pilot', 'episode', 'will', 'show', 'very', 'remarkable', 'transformation', 'later', 'episodes', 'other', 'hand', 'DVD', 'just', 'fine', 'exactly', 'expected', 'very', 'bare', 'bones']",Beverly Hills 90210 - The Pilot Episode

Who would ever buy into the ridiculous dialouge that is the supposed ""voice"" of this show about nothing? What a mess! What an afront to young people living during this awful time! For anyone even remotely interested in the 90's, lemme tell ya...they sucked completely. Fashion was asinine and except for a few small pockets of music, that  sucked as well. Everything ""hip"" and ""cool"" was being bought up by big business who were running over themselves to cash in on ""youth culture"" at a sickening and alarming rate. It was a horrorfying time to be alive, only to be outdone by the oughts (00's). Pathetic, cruel, and no redeeming value whatsoever. Buy something like ""Alice's Restaurant"" instead.
