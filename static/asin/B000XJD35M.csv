The idea isn't that original but the actors throw themselves into it so wholeheartedly that you don't really notice. There are a few laugh out loud moments and the rest in pretty amusing too. It isn't too long so you shouldn't get bored.

1114409,A3GAY5VH2LDFWK,B000XJD35M,,"[1, 2]","""Wedding Daze"" Written and directed by Ian Michael Black, also released as ""The Pleasure of Your Company"".Anderson (Jason Biggs) is in what he believes to be a committed relationship to the woman of his dreams. He intends to propose to her dressed as cupid at a fancy restaurant but the proposal goes awry and leaves Anderson's Fianc&eacute; to be, dead of shock. Anderson is devastated by the loss and left feeling that he will never fall in love again. A year passes and Anderson hasn't gotten out of his slump. Anderson's friend Ted (Michael Weston) suggests that Anderson won't find happiness again unless he tries to find it. At his suggestion Anderson ask the next girl he sees to marry him who happens to be, Katie (Isla Fisher) who is in a relationship with a guy who her mother loves although she isn't so sure she loves him. Her boyfriend had recently proposed over a family game of charades but Katie wasn't sure and said she had to think about it. For some reason she feels Andersons proposal is a good idea even though she has never even met him and agrees to marry him on the spot and comedic hilarity ensues......This has to be some of the worst script writing that has ever made it to film. I really feel bad for Biggs and Isla Fisher because I really like both of them but this cant be a good indicator of things to come.The Good: ?????The Bad: None of the comedic situations in this movie worked. The words Hackneyed and trite come to mind when thinking about them. A lot of the comedic moments felt like poor ""American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)"" rip offs.  The end result was a comedy that wasn't funny at all.The overall plot and story are implausible at best and ludicrous at worst which would have been fine if writer/director Michael Black was attempting to take us on a ""Dude, Where's My Car??"" type ride. It seems like he tried slip seamlessly between that genre and the slightly more realistic situation comedy genre ala ""Knocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"" and it just didn't work. This left the movie with a very awkward ""Hodge podge"" type tone which left you wondering how seriously you were supposed to be taking the characters or subject matter.Overall: If you need to see Biggs in a movie about weddings check out ""American Wedding - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)"". If you need to see Isla Fisher in a movie about weddings, check out ""Wedding Crashers - Unrated (Widescreen New Line Platinum Series)"" but do not waste your time on Wedding Daze.",1,Jason Biggs is in need of a new agent,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2513,"['Wedding', 'Daze', 'Written', 'directed', 'Ian', 'Michael', 'Black', 'also', 'released', 'Pleasure', 'Company', '.Anderson', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'what', 'be', 'committed', 'relationship', 'woman', 'dreams', 'propose', 'dressed', 'cupid', 'fancy', 'restaurant', 'proposal', 'awry', 'Anderson', 'Fianc', 'eacute', 'be', 'dead', 'shock', 'Anderson', 'devastated', 'loss', 'left', 'feeling', 'will', 'never', 'fall', 'love', 'again', 'year', 'passes', 'Anderson', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'out', 'slump', 'Anderson', 'friend', 'Ted', 'Michael', 'Weston', 'Anderson', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'happiness', 'again', 'find', 'suggestion', 'Anderson', 'next', 'girl', 'marry', 'who', 'be', 'Katie', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'who', 'relationship', 'guy', 'who', 'mother', ""n't"", 'so', 'sure', 'boyfriend', 'had', 'recently', 'proposed', 'over', 'family', 'game', 'charades', 'Katie', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'said', 'had', 'think', 'reason', 'feels', 'Andersons', 'proposal', 'good', 'idea', 'even', 'never', 'even', 'met', 'marry', 'spot', 'comedic', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'be', 'worst', 'script', 'writing', 'ever', 'made', 'film', 'really', 'feel', 'bad', 'Biggs', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'really', 'cant', 'be', 'good', 'indicator', 'things', 'come.The', 'Good', 'Bad', 'None', 'comedic', 'situations', 'movie', 'worked', 'words', 'Hackneyed', 'trite', 'come', 'mind', 'when', 'thinking', 'lot', 'comedic', 'moments', 'felt', 'poor', 'American', 'Pie', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'rip', 'offs', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'all.The', 'overall', 'plot', 'story', 'are', 'implausible', 'best', 'ludicrous', 'worst', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'writer/director', 'Michael', 'Black', 'was', 'attempting', 'take', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Car', 'type', 'ride', 'tried', 'slip', 'seamlessly', 'genre', 'slightly', 'more', 'realistic', 'situation', 'comedy', 'genre', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'left', 'movie', 'very', 'awkward', 'Hodge', 'podge', 'type', 'tone', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'seriously', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'taking', 'characters', 'subject', 'matter.Overall', 'need', 'see', 'Biggs', 'movie', 'weddings', 'check', 'out', 'American', 'Wedding', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'need', 'see', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'movie', 'weddings', 'check', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'New', 'Line', 'Platinum', 'Series', 'do', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'Wedding', 'Daze']",Wedding Daze
1114410,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000XJD35M,,"[2, 4]","It really isn't fair that an awful film like License to Wed received a wide theatrical release while Wedding Daze a.k.a. The Pleasure of Your Company is released direct-to-video (it did receive a limited theatrical release in England in 2007). Both films are romantic comedies about the trials and tribulations of young couples getting married. It's not surprising that this happened because Licensed has a big name star like Robin Williams to help sell it while Daze has a once bankable star (American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)'s Jason Biggs) and an up-and-coming actress (Isla Fisher). Both films feature broad comedy mixed with the occasional gross-out gag but License resorts to tired, clich&eacute; jokes that we've seen a million times before while Daze features quirky humour courtesy of The State alumni Michael Ian Black.Jason Biggs seems to be channeling the nervous energy of Ben Stiller and the natural likability of Matthew Broderick. His character is a romantic who can't let go of the past. Isla Fisher is her usual charming self with an engaging smile that lights up any room she's in. She's adorable as a girl who wants to lead a more spontaneous life. It turns out that she is just as much a romantic as Anderson. Biggs and Fisher are both adept at physical comedy and are not afraid to look silly. They also have excellent chemistry together and you really root for their characters to succeed.Wedding Daze hits the usual plot points - spending the first night together and meeting the parents - and gives them an off-kilter spin, like Katie's father who makes orthodox toys for Jewish kids or Anderson's father passing on his cock ring to his son. Daze is reminiscent of David O. Russell's oddball comedyFlirting With Disaster (Collector's Edition). Both adhere to the romantic comedy blueprint and end up embellishing it with quirky characters with odd affectations that set it apart from predictable fare like License to Wed.As with the similarly abandoned comedy,Idiocracy, Fox has included hardly any extras on the Wedding Daze DVD. All we get are three deleted scenes that include an alternate opening which wisely was not used and a fantasy sequence with Anderson's dead girlfriend.",4,Not as lousy as you might think...,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,2229,"['really', ""n't"", 'fair', 'awful', 'film', 'License', 'Wed', 'received', 'wide', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Wedding', 'Daze', 'a.k.a', 'Pleasure', 'Company', 'released', 'direct-to-video', 'did', 'receive', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'release', 'England', '2007', 'films', 'are', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'young', 'couples', 'getting', 'married', 'not', 'surprising', 'happened', 'Licensed', 'big', 'name', 'star', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'help', 'sell', 'Daze', 'once', 'bankable', 'star', 'American', 'Pie', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'up-and-coming', 'actress', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'films', 'feature', 'broad', 'comedy', 'mixed', 'occasional', 'gross-out', 'gag', 'License', 'tired', 'clich', 'eacute', 'jokes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'Daze', 'quirky', 'humour', 'courtesy', 'State', 'alumni', 'Michael', 'Ian', 'Black.Jason', 'Biggs', 'be', 'channeling', 'nervous', 'energy', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'natural', 'likability', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'character', 'romantic', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'past', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'usual', 'charming', 'self', 'engaging', 'smile', 'up', 'room', 'adorable', 'girl', 'who', 'lead', 'more', 'spontaneous', 'life', 'out', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'romantic', 'Anderson', 'Biggs', 'Fisher', 'are', 'adept', 'physical', 'comedy', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'look', 'silly', 'also', 'have', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'together', 'really', 'root', 'characters', 'succeed.Wedding', 'Daze', 'usual', 'plot', 'points', 'spending', 'first', 'night', 'together', 'meeting', 'parents', 'off-kilter', 'spin', 'Katie', 'father', 'who', 'orthodox', 'toys', 'Jewish', 'kids', 'Anderson', 'father', 'passing', 'cock', 'ring', 'son', 'Daze', 'reminiscent', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'oddball', 'comedyFlirting', 'Disaster', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'adhere', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'blueprint', 'end', 'up', 'embellishing', 'quirky', 'characters', 'odd', 'affectations', 'set', 'apart', 'predictable', 'fare', 'License', 'Wed.As', 'similarly', 'abandoned', 'comedy', 'Idiocracy', 'Fox', 'included', 'hardly', 'extras', 'Wedding', 'Daze', 'DVD', 'get', 'are', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'alternate', 'opening', 'wisely', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'fantasy', 'sequence', 'Anderson', 'dead', 'girlfriend']",Wedding Daze
1114411,APOUYO1BEPK22,B000XJD35M,,"[2, 4]","The movie does have it's funny moments. Though a lot of it's jokes are pushed for, which gives you that awkward feeling where you feel bad for the actors at the time... heh. But like I said, there are some funny moments in the movie, more than I expected, which is why this movie didn't get a one star from me. Actually Isla Fisher helped the movie also. Her acting might not be that believable at times, but at least she's doesn't hurt the eyes.Now you're probably wondering what the movie is about so I'll let you know real quick. This is what makes the movie bad. The whole plot itself. Anderson is broken hearted a year after his planned proposal didn't go so well. His friend tries to get him to date again, but instead he just likes to mope. With much begging from the friend, Anderson finally agrees, but instead of asking a girl to go on a date, he jokingly (sorta jokingly), asks a girl, Katie (Isla Fisher), to marry him. She was just asked by her boyfriend to get married, but she doesn't want to marry him, so instead she agrees to marry Anderson.Stop right there and soak that in ladies and gentleman. A beautiful girl...just agreed to marry some strange normal looking guy...in a diner. This is not a joke.Ok lets turn back to the movie. So since they are getting married, they decide to go out and get to know one another....meet parents...move in together...meet each others friends. During these encounters are when the funny moments occur (or are supposed to occur)...or maybe when the `romantic' parts of this RomCom are supposed to occur. I didn't find it of the sappy parts to be believable. ""Why?"" you ask. BECAUSE THEY JUST MET LIKE A DAY AGO. I personally believe in love at first sight, but this just was not that.Is the movie worth watching at least? Yeah sure. You can't go wrong with laughing, and this movie will make you laugh sometimes. It's not really a BAD movie; it's just really hard to get into since you can't believe in it. But I did catch myself laughing actually out loud at some parts. SOME parts.One last thing. Jason Biggs is a one track actor. I swear he needs to just be in every American Pie movie because that's all I ever see him as since his acting just never changes.",2,"A decently funny, but completely unbelievable movie.",1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,2217,"['movie', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'lot', 'jokes', 'are', 'pushed', 'awkward', 'feeling', 'where', 'feel', 'bad', 'actors', 'time', 'heh', 'said', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie', 'more', 'expected', 'why', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'star', 'Actually', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'helped', 'movie', 'also', 'acting', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'believable', 'times', 'least', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'eyes.Now', ""'re"", 'probably', 'wondering', 'what', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'let', 'know', 'real', 'quick', 'movie', 'bad', 'whole', 'plot', 'Anderson', 'broken', 'hearted', 'year', 'planned', 'proposal', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'well', 'friend', 'get', 'date', 'again', 'instead', 'just', 'mope', 'much', 'begging', 'friend', 'Anderson', 'finally', 'instead', 'asking', 'girl', 'go', 'date', 'jokingly', 'sorta', 'jokingly', 'girl', 'Katie', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'marry', 'was', 'just', 'asked', 'boyfriend', 'get', 'married', ""n't"", 'want', 'marry', 'so', 'instead', 'marry', 'Anderson.Stop', 'right', 'there', 'soak', 'ladies', 'gentleman', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'just', 'agreed', 'marry', 'strange', 'normal', 'looking', 'guy', 'diner', 'not', 'joke.Ok', 'turn', 'back', 'movie', 'So', 'are', 'getting', 'married', 'decide', 'go', 'out', 'get', 'know', 'one', '.meet', 'parents', 'move', 'together', 'meet', 'others', 'friends', 'encounters', 'are', 'when', 'funny', 'moments', 'occur', 'are', 'supposed', 'occur', 'maybe', 'when', 'romantic', 'parts', 'RomCom', 'are', 'supposed', 'occur', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'sappy', 'parts', 'be', 'believable', 'Why', 'ask', 'THEY', 'JUST', 'MET', 'LIKE', 'A', 'DAY', 'AGO', 'personally', 'believe', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'Yeah', 'sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'laughing', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'sometimes', 'not', 'really', 'BAD', 'movie', 'just', 'really', 'hard', 'get', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'did', 'catch', 'laughing', 'actually', 'out', 'loud', 'parts', 'SOME', 'parts.One', 'last', 'thing', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'one', 'track', 'actor', 'swear', 'just', 'be', 'American', 'Pie', 'movie', 'ever', 'see', 'acting', 'just', 'never', 'changes']",Wedding Daze

1114413,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B000XJD35M,,"[3, 5]","With Wedding Daze (formally The Pleasure of Your Company), the directorial debut from Michael Ian Black, I expected a romantic comedy in the vein of Wedding Crashers... though that is probably only because both star Isla Fisher... what I got, though, was a gag-full American Pie-esque romp centering on two individuals with just the right amount of crazy that makes it hard to root for them either separately, let alone together.When the opening credits rolled, I clapped with glee over the potential: Joanna Gleason (Kim from Friends) played Katie (Fisher)'s mother, a skeletal Joe Pantoliano as her father, Heather Goldenhersh (Lizzy Caplan's sister on The Class) as her best friend, and Matt Malloy as her adoptive father... not to mention the aforementioned Edward Herrmann as Anderson (Jason Biggs)'s father.  Herrmann is a man I've loved since he played Macaulay Culkin's father in Richie Rich, and I will pretty much give anything he's in a try, allowing it the benefit of the doubt because he's such a classy, intelligent actor that he must choose his projects with care.  His first scene in Wedding Daze made me shake my head and exclaim: ""Oh, Richard Gilmore, no.  Just no!"" as his on-screen wife licked whipped cream from his face.  Unfortunately the ones that followed (presenting his son with his c*ck ring; watching two naked women less than half his age make out on a rug in front of a fire in his living room) just proved that not even the cast could save this crude romantic comedy.Wedding Daze starts off simply enough: a young romantic's whole world crashes down around him when the girlfriend to whom he is in the middle of proposing collapses on the floor in front of him.  He spirals, needless to say, and decides on an impetuous whim to propose to the woman currently waiting on him in some roadhouse diner.  Luckily, she is just as spontaneous (read: nuts) as he is, and though she had been pondering a proposal from her Charades-loving boyfriend, she needs nothing but a split second to scream in joy and accept the hand (though no ring) of Anderson.  Fisher is one of a handful of this generation's true comedic gems, whose talent would be best suited in a female-centric piece in which she can really shine.  Needless to say, Wedding Daze is not one such piece, and in it, she is forced to take a backseat to prop humor (a diaphragm ending up in a sandwich... is that the best you could do?  Really?) and the much more one-note Biggs.  He relies on his bright white smile to endear his audiences, but years after first winning them over as a big-eyed, geek-chic teenager, the act (like himself) has just grown old; he has not matured.Katie and Anderson go through the usual dance of trying to fit into one another's worlds and overcoming the obstacles of different families and friends but still come out on the other side wanting to get married.  I think they have known each other for about four days at that point.  The movie picks up quickly from there, as the duo steal a car to elope, all the while Katie's mother and biological father hold up a hardware store to get their daughter the money for a proper wedding.  Arresting chaos ensues, including a cameo standoff with Rob Corddry, and Katie delivers her ""Despite all of our insane obstacles and the red flags advising us otherwise, I want to be with you"" speech while both families are behind bars.  Her words-from-the-heart (or perhaps the gun she shoots at the ceiling) is somehow enough to convince everyone (perhaps because it's the eight-minute mark, and for a comedy this thin, that's nearing the end) because thirty seconds later, they are marching down the aisle at the little Atlantic City wedding chapel at which her own parents eloped twenty-odd years ago.  The Reverend tells the happy couple that he can personally guarantee anyone who marries at his establishment will be happy forever, but it's way too late for the love affair with this movie.(Though I will admit the ""Jewnicorn"" and ""Jewlahoop"" did elicit a chuckle.)Wedding Daze should have ended there, but Black (who was a hybrid on this project) just couldn't end on a genuinely sweet (albeit completely unrealistic) moment.

There are many scenes where the laughs keep coming, and with reckless abandon at that, but the film never is able to shake that feeling that this was low-brow and under-produced.It just feels lacking.The film stars the vivacious Isla Fisher and the `where has he been' star of `American Pie', Jason Biggs.  Jason plays Anderson, a young and in love man who accidentally scares his fianc&eacute; to death when he proposes dresses up as Cupid.  Still in mourning a year later, he happens to meet the young and spontaneous Katie who is running from a proposal herself.  On a whim (or a dare, however you want to interpret that) he asks her to marry him and she accepts.  Now, both Anderson and Katie have a long list of quirks and issues of their own, but together they make such a mismatched pair that you can't help but see how `meant for each other' they truly are.For me, the films main faults is that it runs out of comedic ideas too soon.  It doesn't know how to sustain the intriguing plot.  Instead, it falls into the rut of delivering one overdone gross-out gag after another.  It doesn't know the word subtlety, and it doesn't understand the importance of variety.  That said, when it nails something, it nails it hard.  On top of that, Fisher is just plain ridiculously watchable; I mean, you're eyes never want to leave her.  Biggs seems grown up, which is a good thing.  I could actually see him becoming a honed leading man, that is if he ever gets good work again.  The supporting cast is hit or miss, with some of their side-plots getting in the way of the film being truly wonderful.  Joanna Gleason is probably my favorite of the supporting cast.  Joe Pantoliano is probably my least favorite.While there isn't really anything GIGANTIC to complain about here, there isn't really anything GIGANTIC to praise either.  The film just rest comfortably in the middle.  It's a forgettable yet enjoyable film.  I really liked the premise but I felt it was underdeveloped in an exchange for cheap gags that are too overused in comedies today.And what was up with Edward Herrmann and Margo Martindale?  That couple was so strangely bi-polar, and their comedic efforts reaped similar rewards.  I found their overdone love life to grow tired after the 3rd or 4th gag, but I found Martindale's `out of the blue' gangster turn in the kitchen (""I'll cut you!"") to be ROLL ON THE FLOOR HILARIOUS!See this film, and then decide for yourself.",3,An interesting premise gets held back by predictable gags...,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,2556,"['film', 'certainly', 'straight', 'video', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'work', 'comedy', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'laughs', 'keep', 'coming', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'film', 'never', 'able', 'shake', 'feeling', 'was', 'low-brow', 'under-produced.It', 'just', 'feels', 'lacking.The', 'film', 'vivacious', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'where', 'been', 'star', 'American', 'Pie', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'Jason', 'Anderson', 'young', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'accidentally', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'death', 'when', 'up', 'Cupid', 'Still', 'mourning', 'year', 'later', 'meet', 'young', 'spontaneous', 'Katie', 'who', 'running', 'proposal', 'whim', 'dare', 'however', 'want', 'interpret', 'marry', 'Now', 'Anderson', 'Katie', 'have', 'long', 'list', 'quirks', 'issues', 'own', 'together', 'make', 'mismatched', 'pair', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'see', 'how', 'meant', 'other', 'truly', 'films', 'main', 'faults', 'comedic', 'ideas', 'too', 'soon', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'sustain', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'Instead', 'rut', 'delivering', 'one', 'overdone', 'gross-out', 'gag', ""n't"", 'know', 'word', 'subtlety', ""n't"", 'understand', 'importance', 'variety', 'said', 'when', 'something', 'hard', 'top', 'Fisher', 'just', 'plain', 'ridiculously', 'watchable', 'mean', ""'re"", 'eyes', 'never', 'want', 'leave', 'Biggs', 'grown', 'up', 'good', 'thing', 'could', 'actually', 'see', 'becoming', 'honed', 'leading', 'man', 'ever', 'good', 'work', 'again', 'supporting', 'cast', 'hit', 'miss', 'side-plots', 'getting', 'way', 'film', 'being', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'Joanna', 'Gleason', 'probably', 'favorite', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'probably', 'least', 'favorite.While', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'GIGANTIC', 'complain', 'here', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'GIGANTIC', 'praise', 'either', 'film', 'just', 'rest', 'comfortably', 'middle', 'forgettable', 'yet', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'premise', 'felt', 'was', 'underdeveloped', 'exchange', 'cheap', 'gags', 'are', 'too', 'overused', 'comedies', 'today.And', 'was', 'up', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'Margo', 'Martindale', 'couple', 'was', 'so', 'strangely', 'bi-polar', 'comedic', 'efforts', 'reaped', 'similar', 'rewards', 'found', 'overdone', 'love', 'life', 'grow', 'tired', '3rd', '4th', 'gag', 'found', 'Martindale', 'blue', 'gangster', 'turn', 'kitchen', ""'ll"", 'cut', 'be', 'ROLL', 'ON', 'THE', 'FLOOR', 'HILARIOUS', 'See', 'film', 'then', 'decide']",Wedding Daze

I don't know where it went, but it WASN'T in the final cut of the movie.Not that the main actors involved didn't turn in good performances.  Jason Biggs has gotten his one-trick pony of pathologically-spastic-eccentric-geek-stunts/""potty humor"" performance down pat.  (Not as much of a compliment as that might sound, Jason!)  Isla Fisher turns out to be the bright side of this movie, turning in a fresh and genuine performance that nicely compliments her physical beauty.Love is not an emotion--contrary to popular opinion.  Love is a decision.  Even the best relationships do not FEEL the emotion all the time.  This movie COULD have chosen to emphasize the fact that in all marriages there comes a time when you must continue to CHOOSE to love the other person.  That love is a decision you make daily, is the mechanism of how arranged marriages have worked down through the ages in multiple cultures.  (Don't get me wrong--I'm not advocating arranged marriages; this is just to illustrate and emphasize my point.)By its wild exaggeration of decision over emotion, the premise of this movie could have made the point that a committed marriage CAN result from sheer force of wills and the valuing of commitment.  The movie COULD HAVE chosen to emphasize these positive things that are sorely needed in this age of near-universal devaluation of marriage and easy divorce--but it didn't.Instead, it emphasizes the feelings which most people confuse with love anyway.  By the glorification of entering into marriage frivolously, it suggests that love and a stable marriage can come without thought, without doing any the SANE things that dating couples should be doing prior to marriage to discern whether someone is a proper mate.  In the process, it takes every opportunity to demean and degrade the institute and sacrament of marriage.Sadly, there are also several examples of the ""lowest common denominator"" bathroom humor and impurity/immorality that one associates with Jason Biggs and the ""American Pie"" crowd.There is some good writing in this movie, and several (non-bathroom humor) laugh-out-loud moments.  Those and the aforementioned performance by Isla Fisher are the reasons I didn't give this only one star.  This is a good movie to see for free--and even then you may feel cheated.  I certainly recommend against buying it.The DVD is of average quality, with scant extra features--but then again, perhaps that's a plus.",2,Potential--NOT realized,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,2469,"['movie', 'plot', 'HAD', 'potential', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'went', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'final', 'cut', 'movie.Not', 'main', 'actors', 'involved', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'good', 'performances', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'gotten', 'one-trick', 'pony', 'pathologically-spastic-eccentric-geek-stunts/', 'potty', 'humor', 'performance', 'down', 'pat', 'Not', 'as', 'much', 'compliment', 'might', 'sound', 'Jason', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'out', 'be', 'bright', 'side', 'movie', 'turning', 'fresh', 'genuine', 'performance', 'nicely', 'physical', 'beauty.Love', 'not', 'emotion', 'contrary', 'popular', 'opinion', 'Love', 'decision', 'Even', 'best', 'relationships', 'do', 'not', 'FEEL', 'emotion', 'time', 'movie', 'COULD', 'have', 'chosen', 'emphasize', 'fact', 'marriages', 'there', 'time', 'when', 'must', 'continue', 'CHOOSE', 'love', 'other', 'person', 'love', 'decision', 'make', 'daily', 'mechanism', 'how', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'have', 'worked', 'down', 'ages', 'multiple', 'cultures', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'advocating', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'just', 'illustrate', 'emphasize', 'point', 'wild', 'exaggeration', 'decision', 'emotion', 'premise', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'point', 'committed', 'marriage', 'CAN', 'result', 'sheer', 'force', 'wills', 'valuing', 'commitment', 'movie', 'COULD', 'HAVE', 'chosen', 'emphasize', 'positive', 'things', 'are', 'sorely', 'needed', 'age', 'near-universal', 'devaluation', 'marriage', 'easy', 'divorce', 'feelings', 'most', 'people', 'confuse', 'love', 'anyway', 'glorification', 'entering', 'marriage', 'frivolously', 'love', 'stable', 'marriage', 'can', 'come', 'thought', 'doing', 'SANE', 'things', 'dating', 'couples', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'prior', 'marriage', 'discern', 'someone', 'proper', 'mate', 'process', 'opportunity', 'demean', 'degrade', 'institute', 'sacrament', 'marriage.Sadly', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'examples', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'impurity/immorality', 'one', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'American', 'Pie', 'crowd.There', 'good', 'writing', 'movie', 'several', 'non-bathroom', 'humor', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'aforementioned', 'performance', 'Isla', 'Fisher', 'are', 'reasons', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'good', 'movie', 'see', 'free', 'even', 'then', 'may', 'feel', 'cheated', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'average', 'quality', 'scant', 'extra', 'features', 'then', 'again', 'perhaps', 'plus']",Wedding Daze

Given the leads, and backgrounds of same, I expected something more along the lines of say American Pie or Wedding Crashers, but this was rather tame.  Note that says tame, not lame.  Released straight to video, rather than going to theatres, one might think the movie here isn't worth the time, but that isn't true.  Perhaps somewhat in line with the American Pie 'wedding movie', this one is certainly formulaic but delivers a cute movie if you care to sit and watch it.Anderson (Jason Biggs) has his anticipated fiance unexpectedly become, well, unavailable.  Heartbroken, not ready to move on, despite his best friend telling him that his relationship wasn't ready to move on to the next level begin with, he's somewhat dared into striking up a new relationship.  One that by chances happens to involve Kate (Wedding Crasher's crazy red head Isla Fisher).  So starts a rushed romantic relationship as the two characters propose to each other, accept the proposals and then question whether or not their relationship is a a good or bad thing.  Can they actually make it through to getting married, or will the baggage each carries ruin things before they can even get started?The comedy isn't quite as low-brow (for the most part) as any of the American Pie movies, or say Saving Silverman (another Biggs starring role) would be, but there are some funny scenes stolen by Anderson's parents and Katie's as well.Coarse language at times, sexual content/suggestive behavior, probably deserved of the R rating that is carried for this one.

After seeing a trailer online that suggested a funny if completely absurd film, I never saw another thing about this film.  It didn't receive very positive reviews, didn't stay long in the theatres and didn't really catch my attention until I noticed it was on Netflix's ""View Now"" roster.  So, I decided to give it a late chance and came away with a smile.Let's get one thing clear: the movie is ridiculous.  Boy Meets Girl.  Boy accidently kills girl.  Boy is sad.  Boy meets second girl and instantly proposes on a lark.  Girl says yes.  Hijinks ensue.  What this means for Wedding Daze is that Anderson (Jason Biggs) proposes to his girlfiend who is so shocked, she has a heart attack.  He becomes inconsolable until his best friend forces him to ask out the next girl he sees.  At this moment, Anderson meets Katie (Isla Fisher) and, instead of asking her out, asks her to marry him.  She says yes, shocking both of them, and then the aforementioned hijinks (and awkwardness) abound.It's a pretty silly movie, written and directed by the equally silly Michael Ian Black, that works only because of the inspired casting.  The two leads, Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher, have always been perfect comedic choices and they are zany and funny here.  Even when the story gets a little long in the tooth and extends a bit further than it probably should, they keep it mostly afloat.  It feels like the grownup cousin of Saving Silverman, another absurd-but-decent comedy.  And it can get away with a bit more with its R rating.
