Some scenes were a stretch, but the viseral and thought impact made up for most of its shortcomings. Nicolas Cage is not one of my favorites but he was spot on as the ""magician"" who can actually see 2 minutes into the future. Great storyline. Seeing the future can be more complex then most people would think and the movie is careful to point that out. That adds realism. I was disappointed with Jessica Biel. Sure shes got a hot body but something was missing from her acting. I think its more that she was the wrong person for the role, too prissy. Pleny of twists and turns. Much time and thought was put into the making of this and it shows. This is the kind of sci-fi that develops appreciation from true lovers of the genre. Its good to see Peter Falk in a film again, especially this kind of film.

Where the movie doesn't quite succeed is where Nic has to stop people from setting off a nuclear bomb.  Where the movie starts great and gets you involved not only in his mysterious power, but his romantic involvement with Miss Biel, it falls just a little short on the action near its end and the special effects are far from special.Still I enjoyed the movie and I have watched it several times and continue to enjoy it.

If we had the ability to see into the future what would we do with that ability? Tamahori spends a brief ninety six minutes trying to answer this question.Las Vegas showroom magician Cris Johnson (Nicholas Cage) has a secret which torments him: he can see two minutes into the future. Sick of the examinations he underwent as a child and the interest of the government and medical establishment in his power, he lies low under an assumed name in Vegas, performing cheap tricks and living off small-time gambling ""winnings."" But when a terrorist group threatens to detonate a nuclear device in Los Angeles, government agent Callie Ferris Julianne Moore) must use all her skills to capture Cris and convince him to help her stop the cataclysm. Along for the ride is potential love interest and terrorist bait Liz Cooper (Jessica Biel).This movie has a premise that would be incredibly interesting if explored more deftly. Instead what we get is a nonsensical chase movie that feels cobbled together. The screenplay by Gary Goldman is based on the Phillip K. Dick short story ""The Golden Man."" The performances by Cage and Moore seem wooden and the dialogue feels turgid and contrived. As for the terrorist group's plotting: I can honestly say I have no clue who these people are or what they are trying to accomplish. The film simply provides a sketch of an idea and pits everyone against each other. There is plenty of action but none of it is really convincing. If the movie is anything it is loud.The HD DVD that I viewed presented an adequate transfer of the film. David Tattersall's photography seems overly heavy and saturated at times.

This will however, not be a review of picture quality or menu fluidity. This will simply be a review about the movie itself, the characters, scenery and the story are all something I will touch upon.When I first saw the trailer for ""NEXT"" I thought it seemed a bit too corny and a bit too full of CGI to even give us a credible storyline. However I was proven wrong when, after a recommendation from a friend I decided to get this on Blu-Ray.From the first few minutes of this film I knew my first impressions of this film were clouded by partial judgment, as within the first few minutes we were subjected to a slick and stylish action thriller.The story is that a small time Vegas strip magician known as Cris Johnson has an extraordinary gift to be able to see 2 minutes ahead. This to Cris is a curse as he is never surprised and as a child subjected him to rigorous testing which left him bitter and lonely. After Cris sees that a man is about to rob the Casino, he tries to stop him which leads to a misunderstanding and means that Cris has to leave. After stylishly dodging each security guard he manages to escape the Casino and the clutches of the FBI who are chasing him for another reason. A group of Russian terrorists gain possession of a Nuclear device and threaten to set it off in L.A. The Russians want to kill him and the FBI want him to help them prevent this major terrorist situation, the only problem is that Cris is always two minutes ahead of schedule.Nicholas Cage has never really been my favourite actor, but in roles such as this he really pulls off the character brilliantly. Cris Johnson is a man that has never been surprised, he's always been able to tell what happens next and this has helped him escape some sticky situations.Jessica Biel plays the love interest, that admittedly has no real depth to her character or any sort of dimension that would make us care for her and their relationship.Julianne Moore plays the hardarse FBI agent who simply wants him to help prevent the possible deaths of 8 million people. She simply wants him to help prevent the tragedy then to send him on his way, but as she comes to know Cris and how he feels and works she becomes more emotionally involved and it eventually becomes a relationship that is more than just business.Overall the film is quite intelligent and quite slick, the scenes where we see Cris consider all possible scenarios before he takes the appropriate action are very well done. The character of Liz really drags down this movie as the relationship seems rushed and simply doesn't work as the character is very much one dimensional anyway. I honestly think Cage shines in this film and action movies are something that I think Cage can actually carry on his shoulders.This is a very good popcorn movie although it did have its flaws there's no doubt it's entertaining and can give you a good night in.",4,"Blu-Ray Is ""NEXT"" In Line.",1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,3011,"['title', 'already', 'released', 'Blu-Ray', 'UK', 'review', 'based', 'viewing', 'film', 'Blu-Ray', 'will', 'however', 'not', 'be', 'review', 'picture', 'quality', 'menu', 'fluidity', 'will', 'simply', 'be', 'review', 'movie', 'characters', 'scenery', 'story', 'are', 'something', 'will', 'touch', 'upon.When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'NEXT', 'thought', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'corny', 'bit', 'too', 'full', 'CGI', 'even', 'give', 'credible', 'storyline', 'However', 'was', 'proven', 'wrong', 'when', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'decided', 'get', 'Blu-Ray.From', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'knew', 'first', 'impressions', 'film', 'were', 'clouded', 'partial', 'judgment', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'were', 'subjected', 'slick', 'stylish', 'action', 'thriller.The', 'story', 'small', 'time', 'Vegas', 'strip', 'magician', 'known', 'Cris', 'Johnson', 'extraordinary', 'gift', 'be', 'able', 'see', '2', 'minutes', 'ahead', 'Cris', 'curse', 'never', 'surprised', 'child', 'subjected', 'rigorous', 'testing', 'left', 'bitter', 'lonely', 'Cris', 'man', 'rob', 'Casino', 'stop', 'misunderstanding', 'Cris', 'leave', 'stylishly', 'dodging', 'security', 'guard', 'escape', 'Casino', 'clutches', 'FBI', 'who', 'are', 'chasing', 'reason', 'group', 'Russian', 'terrorists', 'gain', 'possession', 'Nuclear', 'device', 'threaten', 'set', 'off', 'L.A', 'Russians', 'want', 'kill', 'FBI', 'want', 'help', 'prevent', 'major', 'terrorist', 'situation', 'only', 'problem', 'Cris', 'always', 'two', 'minutes', 'ahead', 'schedule.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'favourite', 'actor', 'roles', 'such', 'really', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'Cris', 'Johnson', 'man', 'never', 'been', 'surprised', 'always', 'been', 'able', 'tell', 'what', 'next', 'helped', 'escape', 'sticky', 'situations.Jessica', 'Biel', 'love', 'interest', 'admittedly', 'real', 'depth', 'character', 'sort', 'dimension', 'would', 'make', 'care', 'relationship.Julianne', 'Moore', 'hardarse', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'simply', 'help', 'prevent', 'possible', 'deaths', '8', 'million', 'people', 'simply', 'help', 'prevent', 'tragedy', 'then', 'send', 'way', 'know', 'Cris', 'how', 'more', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'eventually', 'relationship', 'more', 'just', 'business.Overall', 'film', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'quite', 'slick', 'scenes', 'where', 'see', 'Cris', 'consider', 'possible', 'scenarios', 'appropriate', 'action', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'character', 'Liz', 'really', 'down', 'movie', 'relationship', 'rushed', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'dimensional', 'anyway', 'honestly', 'think', 'Cage', 'shines', 'film', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'something', 'think', 'Cage', 'can', 'actually', 'carry', 'shoulders.This', 'very', 'good', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'flaws', 'doubt', 'entertaining', 'can', 'give', 'good', 'night']",N/A

1089653,A1F79FJJ7WZ0Q0,B000TGJ8A8,Castaway Reviewer,"[1, 2]","The only book by Phillip K. Dick I've every read (and I'm a major Science Fiction Fan) was ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" which was the basis for the movie Bladerunner. The only reason I read it was because I was a fan of the Movie. I was thoroughly disappointed with the Book. Nine feature films based on Dick's fiction have appeared, the other eight being Total Recall, The Minority Report, Screamers, Impostor, the French film Confessions d'un Barjo (based on Dick's mainstream novel, Confessions of a Crap Artist), Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly and Finally ""NEXT"". So when I read all the Critics' Negative reviews when NEXT was released, I passed it up at the Theater. Well, I am now sorry I passed it up.  I went ahead and bought a copy a found the movie exciting and very entertaining. There were only two things I had a hard time dealing with in this Movie. First: Nicolas Cage looked old and washed out yet he can still get a beautiful young woman who is a complete stranger, as far as she is concerned, to have unprotected sex with. Think about it. Old, greasy headed chain smoker and young beautiful woman. Wake up and smell nuclear bomb for Pete's sake. Did anyone else notice the clip of Doctor Strangelove on the Motel TV? Second: His leaps into all the possible futures reminded me too much of Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day"". Both the females in those movies came to the same conclusion. They were being set up.

1089655,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000TGJ8A8,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 4]","It's risky for a story to intentionally fool with time, specifically a linear sequence of events; the end result will be either a uniquely constructed narrative or a convoluted mess. ""Next""--based on Philip K. Dick's short story ""The Golden Man""--is about a man who has the ability to see two minutes into his own future, which is just enough of a heads up to prevent certain things from happening. The idea is enough to attract anyone's attention, and thank goodness that it actually redeems itself by the end of the film; while nowhere near as complex or thought provoking as last summer's Philip K. Dick adaptation--""A Scanner Darkly""--it still manages to be a thoroughly entertaining story, a pre-summer popcorn flick with an engaging plot and decent performances.The film opens in Las Vegas, where Cris Johnson (Nicholas Cage) headlines a magic show under the alias Frank Cadillac. When not on stage, he gambles at local casinos, puffing on cigarettes while trying to manipulate his odds of hitting jackpots. He is, of course, under constant surveillance, and on this particular night, his antics go a little too far, prompting Security to intervene. The situation is made worse when he envisions a casino shooting and prevents it from happening; he makes himself look guilty, and he's forced to escape. This sequence is loaded with plausibility problems; even if you have the ability to peak into the future, it's still impossible to escape the ever-present surveillance cameras (I should know; I've been to Vegas many times). Not only can Security see his every move, they also follow him closely as he darts around the casino. Yet he escapes with ease. He also manages to steal someone's car.Luckily, the rest of the film succeeds in overshadowing this sequence. This is when FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) is introduced; she's had her eye on Johnson ever since learning of an international threat against America. A group of Russian terrorists have stolen a nuclear warhead and plan to detonate it in Los Angeles, which will result in the deaths of eight million people. Johnson's precognitive abilities are perfectly suited for preventing a disaster of this magnitude, which is why she feels justified in forcing him to cooperate. After all, it's not about him: it's about saving millions of lives.Johnson, as you might expect, is not anxious to be a pawn of the American government. The most obvious solution is for him to leave Vegas and hide in some remote part of the country. But he can't. This is because, for reasons he can't explain, he's been having visions of a young woman in a local diner, and he simply has to meet her and find out why. This is a troubling situation; when it comes to this mystery woman, he can see far beyond two minutes into the future. It's never adequately explained, even when he finally does meet her after months of visiting the diner, sitting at the counter and sipping away at martinis (you usually don't associate martinis with diners, but I digress). Her name is Liz (Jessica Biel), and she befriends Johnson when he disrupts a confrontation between her and her controlling ex-boyfriend.It isn't until the two meet that Johnson finally decides to flee Vegas; they both travel to Flagstaff, Arizona, where Liz teaches at a local Native American reservation. Unbeknownst to them both, Agent Ferris and her team are hot on their trail. The same can be said for the Russian terrorists; Johnson is a threat that must be eliminated at any cost.Parts of this film play like scenes from a run-of-the-mill Espionage Thriller, much like the material of a James Bond story: we have the dastardly plot to destroy a major city; we have the international bad guys; we have the lone figure who has the ability to stop them. This was actually more of a distraction than anything else, which may be bothersome to those who have read the original Philip K. Dick story; to say that this adaptation is unfaithful to its source would be an understatement. But in all honesty, a comparison is completely unnecessary. I say this because the screen story stands on it's own, and for the most part, it works. Johnson is a fascinating character--someone both blessed and cursed with a supernatural ability that could be used for humanity's benefit. But how would it benefit him? ""If I help you,"" he says after he's caught by the FBI and restrained in front of a TV screen, ""you'll keep me strapped to this chair forever."" He has a point; he may be able to foil this nuclear threat, but it would mean the loss of his personal freedom.The final sequences of the film follow a fairly routine structure: Johnson teams up with the FBI hoping to save both the population of Los Angeles and Liz, who has since been kidnapped by the Russians. Johnson's ability is used to its fullest at this point; this is a treat for the audience, especially during a climactic sequence in an industrial complex. All this paves the way for an end sequence that I didn't see coming. I won't go so far as to call it a twist ending, but I will say that it was unique. I don't know if the same can be said for ""Next"" as a whole, but so what? It was entertaining just the same.",4,Two Minutes Until ...,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,5184,"['risky', 'story', 'intentionally', 'fool', 'time', 'specifically', 'linear', 'sequence', 'events',

Dick's short story ""Golden Man,"" Cage's protagonist is also named Chris and he reluctantly decides to battle against the forces of evil (unnamed terrorists with a nuclear weapon). His own secret weapon is that he can visualize in advance various scenarios that would play out in reality, depending on one course of action or another. A little like Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day,"" but with higher stakes.Chris meets an attractive woman (Jessica Biel) at a diner and would just as soon forget about his chances at heroism, but an FBI team leader (Julianne Moore) prevails upon him to help track down the terrorists. Along the way, he skillfully avoids several brushes with death and seems to connect all the dots in such a way that he, Liz (Biel), and Callie (Moore) all survive and go on to defeat the terrorists.

I didn't quite understand why they needed Cris's talents, and I didn't understand the terrorists' objective, and what the heck the FBI was doing to Cris with the eye clamps is a complete mystery.The climax, however, using the precognition in an action scene, was very cool, and I enjoyed it as much as the somewhat similar scene in Morgan Hawke's novella ""Fortune's Star"" in the anthologyHard Candy.I know Nicholas Cage gets on some people's nerves, and this is not the movie to change their minds.

They just can't get into their head that if you change one little thing, everything changes. ""Next"" avoids this problem altogether, by shrinking the margin of travel to two-minutes, for the most part. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself.Story: Nicolas Cage's character apparently can see into the future, which is both a blessing and a curse. He can see a bank robbery and a murder before it happens, and prevent it, saving innocent lives. But since the police can't see the future, they take offence at this mysterious magician seemingly punching people for no apparent reason. But he can also avoid them with this ability, which is how he chooses to live his life. But wait... then the darn government agents have to interfere, asking his to stop a nuclear bomb from going off. However, since his ability seemingly can only go two-minutes, he isn't much help. Until he meets a woman that seemingly amplifies his powers to great lengths.Concept: Pretty darn interesting, and original. His powers also evolve over time, making them and character, and for that matter, the movie rather unpredictable. And while the concept is handled rather well, the movie makes it very confusing for viewers that totally aren't mentally into the movie. But think of his powers this way, he basically can go ""Groundhog Day"" for two-minutes. Rather original, I think.Good Guys: Nicolas Cage is again amazing in the role, and is really perfect for the role, giving the character added depth and emotion. The character therefore is likable, and you feel for him, even though his background information is left completely out of the picture unlike most 'superpower' movies. Jessica Biel does surprisingly well, sure she doesn't blow you out of the water, and the character is pretty cut and paste, she still does fine with it. And even though Peter Falk is listed as one of the main actors, he has all but a few lines, and is more of a cameo.Bad Guys: Julianne Moore shows off her mean side in this film, and while she was never a bundle of joy, she isn't exactly a caring government agent in this film. Exact opposite, while she's doing her job, the character plays good cop sometimes, her only use for Chris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) is too stop the bad guys, which isn't bad, they just bring up some torture questions in the movie, which I personally could have done without. Definitely not the best of roles for Moore.Her partner however could be even worse, not because he's mean or anything, but thank god he only says a few lines, because he's just a downright pathetic and horrible actor to the nth degree. You cringe everytime you hear him speak. Soap-Opera bad doesn't describe it, it's Sci-Fi channel bad. Pathetic, and a real oversight on the director, and Producer Cage. The terrorist on the other hand are pretty bland, and cardboard. But with the main terrorist's name being ""Mr. Smith,"" did you expect anything else?Effects and Action: There's a bunch of ""oh snap!"" moments in terms of action in this film. Particularly the jumping over the tracks, and totally awesome hill sequence. That was just amazing, until the part at the bottom, where I noticed a couple of effects that looked about ten years old. But other than that, they rarely fail to disappoint. While they aren't exactly blockbuster, they're pretty good considering the rather low budget.The End: Here's the thing, up until this point, I've thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and was ready and willing for another half an hour, and it looked as if it was heading in that direction, because that's what happened in every other movie like this. They go through the scenario the first time, screw up, try it again, get it right, happy ending. However, with this movie, you're forced to make up the ending on your own. 'But wait, I'm seeing somebody else's story, so I don't have to make up my own.' Well, if you're that type of person, and most of us are, you won't like the ending at all. But apparently, they didn't have the production budget for it, so they cut the movie about 30 minutes short. Sure you'll feel cheated, sure you'll be angry.Overall, this movie is a rather enjoyable popcorn flick, and a great movie to see on TNT or something. It has a great concept, an interesting story, and good characters. However, all these element have their glaring flaws that mar a otherwise great movie. It's still a good movie, just not great. Also, you have to really pay attention to this movie, because you'll get confused very easily if you don't. Chris's power evolves, and sometimes you don't know what is the future, and what is the present, so sometimes you'll be shocked. But if you do pay attention, the movie is actually improved because of those otherwise confusing elements. And I actually would love a sequel to this movie.",4,A Good Popcorn Flick With Flaws,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,4899,"['must', 'admit', 'love', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', 'end', 'most', 'fall', 'short', 'subject', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'change', 'one', 'little', 'thing', 'everything', 'changes', 'Next', 'avoids', 'problem', 'altogether', 'shrinking', 'margin', 'travel', 'two-minutes', 'most', 'part', ""'m"", 'getting', 'little', 'ahead', 'myself.Story', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'character', 'apparently', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'blessing', 'curse', 'can', 'see', 'bank', 'robbery', 'murder', 'prevent', 'saving', 'innocent', 'lives', 'police', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'future', 'take', 'offence', 'mysterious', 'magician', 'seemingly', 'punching', 'people', 'apparent', 'reason', 'can', 'also', 'avoid', 'ability', 'how', 'live', 'life', 'wait', 'then', 'darn', 'government', 'agents', 'have', 'interfere', 'asking', 'stop', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'going', 'off', 'However', 'ability', 'seemingly', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'two-minutes', ""n't"", 'much', 'help', 'woman', 'seemingly', 'powers', 'great', 'lengths.Concept', 'Pretty', 'darn', 'interesting', 'original', 'powers', 'also', 'evolve', 'time', 'making', 'character', 'matter', 'movie', 'rather', 'unpredictable', 'concept', 'handled', 'rather', 'well', 'movie', 'very', 'confusing', 'viewers', 'totally', 'are', ""n't"", 'mentally', 'movie', 'think', 'powers', 'way', 'basically', 'can', 'go', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'two-minutes', 'Rather', 'original', 'think.Good', 'Guys', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'again', 'amazing', 'role', 'really', 'perfect', 'role', 'giving', 'character', 'added', 'depth', 'emotion', 'character', 'therefore', 'likable', 'feel', 'even', 'background', 'information', 'left', 'completely', 'picture', 'most', ""'superpower"", 'movies', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'sure', ""n't"", 'blow', 'water', 'character', 'pretty', 'cut', 'paste', 'still', 'fine', 'even', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'listed', 'one', 'main', 'actors', 'few', 'lines', 'more', 'cameo.Bad', 'Guys', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'mean', 'side', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'bundle', 'joy', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'caring', 'government', 'agent', 'film', 'Exact', 'opposite', 'doing', 'job', 'character', 'good', 'cop', 'sometimes', 'only', 'use', 'Chris', 'Johnson', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'too', 'stop', 'bad', 'guys', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'bring', 'up', 'torture', 'questions', 'movie', 'personally', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Definitely', 'not', 'best', 'roles', 'Moore.Her', 'partner', 'however', 'could', 'be', 'even', 'worse', 'not', 'mean', 'anything', 'thank', 'god', 'only', 'few', 'lines', 'just', 'downright', 'pathetic', 'horrible', 'actor', 'nth', 'degree', 'cringe', 'everytime', 'hear', 'speak', 'Soap-Opera', 'bad', ""n't"", 'describe', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'bad', 'Pathetic', 'real', 'oversight', 'director', 'Producer', 'Cage', 'terrorist', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'pretty', 'bland', 'cardboard', 'main', 'terrorist', 'name', 'being', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'did', 'expect', 'anything', 'else', 'Effects', 'Action', 'bunch', 'oh', 'snap', 'moments', 'terms', 'action', 'film', 'Particularly', 'jumping', 'tracks', 'totally', 'awesome', 'hill', 'sequence', 'was', 'just', 'amazing', 'part', 'bottom', 'where', 'noticed', 'couple', 'effects', 'looked', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'other', 'rarely', 'fail', 'disappoint', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'blockbuster', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'good', 'considering', 'rather', 'low', 'budget.The', 'End', 'Here', 'thing', 'up', 'point', ""'ve"", 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'ready', 'willing', 'hour', 'looked', 'was', 'heading', 'direction', 'what', 'happened', 'other', 'movie', 'go', 'scenario', 'first', 'time', 'screw', 'up', 'try', 'again', 'get', 'right', 'happy', 'ending', 'However', 'movie', ""'re"", 'forced', 'make', 'up', 'ending', 'own', 'wait', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'somebody', 'else', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'Well', ""'re"", 'type', 'person', 'most', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'ending', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'production', 'budget', 'cut', 'movie', '30', 'minutes', 'short', 'Sure', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'cheated', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'angry.Overall', 'movie', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'great', 'movie', 'see', 'TNT', 'something', 'great', 'concept', 'interesting', 'story', 'good', 'characters', 'However', 'element', 'have', 'glaring', 'flaws', 'mar', 'otherwise', 'great', 'movie', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'Also', 'have', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'get', 'confused', 'very', 'easily', 'do', ""n't"", 'Chris', 'power', 'evolves', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'future', 'what', 'present', 'so', 'sometimes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'shocked', 'do', 'pay', 'attention', 'movie', 'actually', 'improved', 'confusing', 'elements', 'actually', 'would', 'love', 'sequel', 'movie']",N/A

1089682,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000TGJ8A8,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Philip K. Dick has been the resource of stories for some very exciting films (Minority Report, Total Recall, Blade Runner), but in NEXT, his short story 'The Golden Man' as adapted by Gary Goldman and directed by Lee Tamahori, the concept of precognition as a human feature in altering  the future falls into a video game format that becomes more action film and less human interest tale.Cris Johnson AKA Frank Cadillac (Nicholas Cage) is a sloe eyed Las Vegas grungy magician who has found a way to hide the fact that he has the gift to see two minutes into his future, a gift that rewards him at the gambling tables but draws attention from the FBI after a thwarted attempt on Cris' part to stop a robbery is captured on video tape. The FBI, especially Agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore), knows that a nuclear device has entered the USA by terrorists headed by 'Mr. Smith' (Thomas Kretschmann), and that if the device cannot be traced, a nuclear bomb threatens the lives of millions of citizens.  Agent Callie observes Cris' talent and engages him to aid in the discovery of the site of the device. But Chris' powers lead him to a beautiful young woman Liz (Jessica Biel) with whom his powers to see into the future can be extended for more than the requisite 2 minutes. After a series of 'attempts' at introduction, Cris and Liz bond, allowing Cris' expanded powers to be of more help to the persistent Agent Callie.  From that point on the film dissolves into yet another combustible crashing action flick with endless CG special effects, all but erasing the character development.  And the ending is as one might expect - not very Philip K. Dick in style.Cage and Biel do well, Moore seems bored with her character, and Kretschman yet again embodies the evil of terrorism and beyond. There are some rather extraneous scenes on an Indian reservation that add little except the beauty of the Grand Canyon to the story, and there are some truly funny scenes of themes and variations on the chances we take in approaching a potential love source.  But in the end all gets rather lost in the explosions ad infinitum that mark the film as a routine action flick.  Grady Harp, September 07",3,A Good Idea from Philip K.

I am a big Nicholas Cage fan, but I have to say that he no longer (if he did) has that dark edge.  He's almost cartoony - and his hair needs serious help.  Still, a good cast, a simple story - make this easy to follow.  Rent or buy it for entertainment.

1089687,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000TGJ8A8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 3]","Several of sci-fi author Philip K. Dick's wonderful stories have been translated to cinema over the years, the most notable ones of which areTotal Recall (Special Limited Edition),Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition), andMinority Report (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition). I even likedPaycheck (Special Collector's Edition)andScreamers. But Philip K. Dick's received shabby treatment from the film industry as well, what withA Scanner Darklyand with this one, NEXT, which is loosely based on Dick's short story ""The Golden Man.""Some plot SPOILERS follow.The premise of both MINORITY REPORT and PAYCHECK hinges in part on a character's knowledge of future events. Same with NEXT. All his life Cris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) has been able to see, with precise clarity, 2 minutes into his own future. All his life he's learned to keep a low profile, and even now he, as the Amazing Frank Cadillac, ekes out a living performing in a shabby little magic act in Vegas, wherein he could disguise his talent as a magic trick. Now and then, because his show doesn't pay a lot, he ventures in a small way towards the gaming tables. Cris is real careful. But, it turns out, he hasn't been careful enough.No-nonsense FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) senses that Cris is more than he seems and asks him to help her locate a nuclear bomb set to detonate in Los Angeles. Cris, however, wants no part of it. He's instead fixated on a beautiful girl he's yet to meet, a girl he glimpses in a bout of precognition. But the FBI aren't the only ones spying on Cris. The terrorists, having noted the FBI's interest in the magician, have been keeping tabs on him, as well. And, in Liz, the girl in the vision, the terrorists and the FBI have finally unearthed Cris's weakness.What drew me to the film was the cool sci-fi set-up. And, unlike most films or books, NEXT endows its lead character not with nebulous visions but with well-detailed peeks into his 2 minute window. The most enjoyable and exciting moments in the film deal with Cris utilizing his gift to deftly evade capture in a casino. This sequence, in terms of its pinpoint timing and execution, is very reminiscent of the hide & seek scenes in MINORITY REPORT and inThe Bourne Ultimatum (Widescreen Edition). After that, the diner scene, where Cris finally meets Liz, is the best and the most humorous. Okay, so these are the good things.Where does the film fall apart? Let's start with the villains, who seem to be mainly Europeans, but are mostly ill-defined and seem to appear in the movie simply because token villains are needed. The last half hour of so of the film deals with Cris taking on the baddies, and I can honestly say that these blaring, full-blown action scenes turn out to be the most dull and uninteresting of the lot. I simply didn't care. Another flaw is that there are too many moments throughout the film where the pace seems to just trudge along. What else? How about the introduction of Peter Falk's supporting character early on and then never seeing him again?And then there's the love story, which to me isn't pulled off convincingly. You have the lovely and grounded Liz, as played very nicely by Jessica Biel, and I guess I don't have it in me to believe that a practical girl like her could instantly hook up with someone like Cris, who, at first glance, seems a dubious and creepy character. When she gets guilt-tripped into offering him a ride, I was thinking: ""How very not clever of her."" Admittedly, a large part of it is that I just wasn't feeling any chemistry between them.Nevertheless, I was ready to forgive and forget all these botherations because I liked the sci-fi gimmick so much. That is, until the ending came along and completed the sabotage. The abrupt ending really, really, really sucks! Although, in retrospect, I guess it's a fitting end to a movie which had been spiraling downhill, anyway. On the acting side, I wish Nic Cage would dial down the quirky a bit. Even Jeff Goldblum says he should tone it down. If he does, I feel his characters would be better off and be more sympathetic. Cage is this close to becoming a caricature of himself. I also expected better from Julianne Moore. Props to Jessica Biel, though, for putting in an honest effort.In the ""Just in case no one's mentioned them yet"" department, here's what we get for special features, which also let down the fans: the obligatory ""Making Of"" featurette (18 minutes); ""The Next 'Grand Idea'"" - a 7 minute featurette focusing on a corner of the Grand Canyon (where several scenes were shot) and its Indian reservation; ""2 Minutes in the Future with Jessica Biel"" - a brief and boring interview; and ""Visualizing the Next Move"" - an 8 minute f/x segment centering on the CG aspects of the film. Overall, a dull set of extras. Sorry.What cleverness there is in this film is ultimately drowned in poor choices and bad film-making. NEXT should've been better. Instead, when folks think of this movie - if they think of it at all - they'll think of the neat sci-fi gimmick, yeah, but also that this one's a derivative action picture with many lulls. In the end, Cris Johnson becomes a character I fear the viewers will forget 2 minutes after having seen the film. And that's just doing Philip K. Dick a disservice.",2,Don't waste your two minutes on this one,1195257600,"11 17, 2007",2007,5300,"['Several', 'sci-fi', 'author', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'wonderful', 'stories', 'have', 'been',

With the exception of the National Treasure movies, I've never been overly impressed with Nicholas Cage as the leading man in a movie.  He's a strong supporting actor.  Plus Cage seems to be a little old for such an action-driven part with a young love interest. And I hate the hair style and its attempt to make him look younger.  And I just don't like Jessica Biel.  Not sure why.  And Julianne Moore tries to be the tough FBI agent and just comes off as a you know what.  And it didn't help that they left important questions unanswered (particularly the one revolving around Biel's character).  So why did I give it 3 stars?  Well, it does have some very good moments that made it worth watching.The story is actually quite interesting.  A man with the ability to see a few minutes into his own future?  What could a person do with that power?  The film uses it to provide a lot of humor, for one.  Chris uses it in the casino, then uses it to dodge security in said casino.  One bit that was very good was how he not only sees into the future, he can see more than one possible future depending on his own actions.  When he finally meets Jessica Biel, he changes his ""approach"" several times to see what will get her to like him!  Cage is charming and it comes across here.  While I think he was too old for the part, and the love-interest of Biel, he did well with it because a person would have to have years of experience to use that power as well as he does in this film.  The special effects were well done.  Nothing awesome, just suited to the movie's tone and story.  The story also had some surprises thrown in to keep the audience guessing. When was Chris using the power, and when wasn't he?  The nuclear bomb scare that has Moore hunting him was silly.  I just couldn't see how his two minutes of sight could help there (and neither could he).  The producers never managed to overcome that, though they did try.  It would have been better to just have them after him because of the power itself.  The ending.  Well, the ending will leave you thinking about the entire film.  Some will hate it, and some will love it.  And though I don't like to admit it (as I fall in the first camp) it was nearly perfect for such a movie.Overall, give this flick a chance and rent it.

""A New Yorker""","[1, 2]","""Nex""t is directed by Lee Tamahori, who also directed one of my favorite films (and his first feature), Once Were Warriors, a fiercely provocative story about Maori culture.  The good news about Next is that Nicolas Cage turns in one of his better performances. No one does the disaffected outsider like Cage, the oddball guy on the fringes who couldn't care less about what's going on around him. Unfortunately, he often takes that persona to such as extreme that he appears to be sleepwalking through his role. This was particularly apparent in Ghost Rider (2007), in which Cage slouched through the whole production, seemingly bored by everything in sight, trying to pass off a bad Elvis imitation as a ""character choice."" As Cris Johnson, Cage brings his bored detachment up a notch, to cynical self-interest. At least he seems more involved in the proceedings this time around, and he's actually a fun character to watch.Julianne Moore reprises her Clarice Starling role from Hannibal (2001) here, as tough-as-nails FBI agent Callie Ferris, a no-nonsense government hound who, one suspects, would have been perfectly home at Guantanamo Bay or Abu Ghraib. Moore seems a little uncomfortable barking orders, and her performance comes across as somewhat forced and unbelievable. She lacks the fire and the intensity for a role such as this, and she makes it way too obvious that she's ""acting"" throughout.What can one say about Jessica Biel? She's eye-candy, pure and simple, with little else to do in this film besides providing a sounding board for Cage and serving as the damsel in distress. For what was required of her, she's fine in this role.The premise as presented, that someone could constantly see every possible outcome of every possible action and still be relatively functional, is a tough one to accept, but if you can get past that and suspend your disbelief for 96 minutes, Next can be a fun film, filled with some great action sequences.",4,[3.5]--Who would of thought......,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,1957,"['Nex', 't', 'directed', 'Lee', 'Tamahori', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'first', 'feature', 'Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'fiercely', 'provocative', 'story', 'Maori', 'culture', 'good', 'news', 'Next', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'one', 'disaffected', 'outsider', 'Cage', 'oddball', 'guy', 'fringes', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'what', 'going', 'Unfortunately', 'often', 'persona', 'such', 'extreme', 'be', 'sleepwalking', 'role', 'was', 'particularly', 'apparent', 'Ghost', 'Rider', '2007', 'Cage', 'slouched', 'whole', 'production', 'seemingly', 'bored', 'everything', 'sight', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'bad', 'Elvis', 'imitation', 'character', 'choice', 'Cris', 'Johnson', 'Cage', 'bored', 'detachment', 'up', 'notch', 'cynical', 'self-interest', 'least', 'more', 'involved', 'proceedings', 'time', 'actually', 'fun', 'character', 'watch.Julianne', 'Moore', 'Clarice', 'Starling', 'role', 'Hannibal', '2001', 'here', 'tough-as-nails', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Callie', 'Ferris', 'no-nonsense', 'government', 'hound', 'who', 'one', 'suspects', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfectly', 'home', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'Moore', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'barking', 'orders', 'performance', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'unbelievable', 'fire', 'intensity', 'role', 'such', 'way', 'too', 'obvious', 'acting', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'eye-candy', 'pure', 'simple', 'little', 'else', 'do', 'film', 'providing', 'sounding', 'board', 'Cage', 'serving', 'damsel', 'distress', 'what', 'was', 'required', 'fine', 'role.The', 'premise', 'presented', 'someone', 'could', 'constantly', 'see', 'possible', 'outcome', 'possible', 'action', 'still', 'be', 'relatively', 'functional', 'tough', 'one', 'accept', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'suspend', 'disbelief', '96', 'minutes', 'Next', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'film', 'filled', 'great', 'action', 'sequences']",N/A

They're cast as educated, sophisticated, professional, completely non-emotional and strangely lacking motive for committing such heinous crimes. I am left to presume that producers are afraid of offending someone and so go with the group least likely to be bothered by such a portrayal. The terrorists aren't developed in the movie - they're just there as cannon fodder, replete with lots of henchmen just as in the ""Die Hard"" series, so that the heroes have plenty of first-person shooter scenes.

Unless you're talking about a hot blonde chick named Liz, in which case, all bets are off!Speaking of betting.  There's a very cleverly done scene in ""Next,"" where Johnson is winning a little too well at a blackjack table.  The guys with eyes in the sky send some goons down to muscle the prognosticating Johnson into the backroom, but he spends the next ten minutes ducking, dodging, spinning, and weaving through the casino with the casual elegance of a man who knows exactly where all of his pursuers will be at all times.  It's fun to watch, but there's also no real point to it.Starring Nicolas Cage (one of my favorite guilty pleasures) and a taking-it-waaaay-too-seriously Julianne Moore (as the bullheaded FBI agent Callie Ferris), ""Next"" is nothing but a premise on a platter.  Pretty much every scene that's even remotely engaging involves Cage dodging giant logs, winning fights without throwing a punch, or thoroughly searching three factory floors without ever taking a step.  I'll admit, it's cool, but it's also the same ""cool,"" over and over again.But there's a lot here that's not that cool.  Like the you-gotta-be-kidding-me love story.  Or the cheesy Russian villains.  Or Cage's hairdo.  (FirstGhost Riderand now this.  What, these films can't afford hair stylists?  The poor guy looks like he's wearing a hood without the sweatshirt.)But the biggest not-cool of them all, and the reason I dropped my rating down to two stars, is the flatline of a finish, a pathetic wrap-up that, quite literally, gives one the impression that they have just watched a movie that was never meant to be finished.  It's one thing to give an audience a gimmicky premise and, for emotional resonance, attach the threat of a nuclear bomb (who ISN'T afraid of those things?).  It's another thing to take all of that resonance (what little there is) and trash it for one last play on the gimmick.

1089728,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B000TGJ8A8,Marshall Lord,"[0, 0]","Nicholas Cage produced and took the lead in this clever, action-packed film inspired by ""The Golden Man"", a short story by Science Fiction author Philip K Dick.Quite a few of Philip K Dick's stories have been made into films -""Minority Report"" and ""Paycheck"" spring to mind. In my opinion this is one of the best and more imaginative, though certainly not the closest to the original. The hero of ""Next"" takes his name and his special abilty from ""The Golden Man"" and some of the action scenes brilliantly bring to life equivalent passages from the short story, although the setting and plot are completely different. Where Philip K Dick's original was set in a time after a war where the government hunts down and euthanises all mutants including those with special abilities, ""Next"" is set in a time like our own, in which a government faced by a serious terrorist threat is looking for any angle, no matter how strange, to help defeat it.Cage plays Cris Johnson, who has the psychic ability to see into the future - but usually only two minutes into the future, and then only if it is something which affects him. Then he sees a beautiful woman (Liz, played by Jessica Biel) visit a restaurant at a specific time of day at some uncertain point in the future, so he waits there for a few minutes each day at that time until she appears.Cage has been earning a living on the stage using his talent to do ""magic tricks"" and supplementing it with a little gambling. But unknown to him, FBI special agent Callie Ferris, played by Julianne Moore, has become aware of his abilities and is convinced his talent is real. She is desperate to apprehend a group of terrorists who have stolen a nuclear warhead and is trying to recruit Cris in the hope that he can help to find the nuke before the bad guys set it off.Unfortunately for both Cris and Liz, the terrorists discover that the same Federal agency which is hunting them is also very interested in Cris. (This isn't stated in the film at any stage but I assumed while I was watching the film that the terrorists are supposed to have either a mole or some kind of highly effective bug inside the FBI.) So the terrorists decide to kill Cris as a potential threat or use someone close to him as a hostage or as bait to flush him out ...The action is pretty much non-stop, usually highly dramatic, and has some original twists, the acting is mostly pretty good, and although there is the odd hole in the plot it is not too difficult to suspend disbelief. The twist at the end is very clever.No, it is never quite explained who the terrorists are or what their objective is, other than that they are a group of ruthless, highly trained and well equipped french-speaking caucasians who want to nuke Southern California. Sadly, in the world we are living in today, the presence of a group of terrorists supported by considerable resources who are prepared to go to great lengths, including the loss of their own lives, to blow up innocent people, is hardly the most implausible part of the film.I'm surprised this wasn't more successful at the box office, I thought it was a very good film, especially if you like Sci-Fi thrillers. If you enjoyed either Paycheck or Minority Report, you will very probably like Next.",4,"Exciting SF inspired by ""The Golden Man"" by Philip K Dick",1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,3258,"['Nicholas', 'Cage', 'produced', 'took', 'lead', 'clever', 'action-packed', 'film', 'inspired', 'Golden', 'Man', 'short', 'story', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'author', 'Philip', 'K', 'Dick.Quite', 'few', 'Philip', 'K', 'Dick', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'films', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Paycheck', 'spring', 'mind', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'more', 'imaginative', 'certainly', 'not', 'closest', 'original', 'hero', 'Next', 'name', 'special', 'abilty', 'Golden', 'Man', 'action', 'scenes', 'brilliantly', 'bring', 'life', 'equivalent', 'passages', 'short', 'story', 'setting', 'plot', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'Where', 'Philip', 'K', 'Dick', 'original', 'was', 'set', 'time', 'war', 'where', 'government', 'hunts', 'down', 'mutants', 'including', 'special', 'abilities', 'Next', 'set', 'time', 'own', 'government', 'faced', 'serious', 'terrorist', 'threat', 'looking', 'angle', 'matter', 'how', 'strange', 'help', 'defeat', 'it.Cage', 'plays', 'Cris', 'Johnson', 'who', 'psychic', 'ability', 'see', 'future', 'usually', 'only', 'two', 'minutes', 'future', 'then', 'only', 'something', 'Then', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Liz', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'visit', 'restaurant', 'specific', 'time', 'day', 'uncertain', 'point', 'future', 'there', 'few', 'minutes', 'day', 'time', 'appears.Cage', 'been', 'earning', 'living', 'stage', 'using', 'talent', 'do', 'magic', 'tricks', 'supplementing', 'little', 'gambling', 'unknown', 'FBI', 'special', 'agent', 'Callie', 'Ferris', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'become', 'aware', 'abilities', 'convinced', 'talent', 'real', 'desperate', 'apprehend', 'group', 'terrorists', 'who', 'have', 'stolen', 'nuclear', 'warhead', 'trying', 'recruit', 'Cris', 'hope', 'can', 'help', 'find', 'nuke', 'bad', 'guys', 'set', 'off.Unfortunately', 'Cris', 'Liz', 'terrorists', 'discover', 'same', 'Federal', 'agency', 'hunting', 'also', 'very', 'interested', 'Cris', ""n't"", 'stated', 'film', 'stage', 'assumed', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'terrorists', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'mole', 'kind', 'highly', 'effective', 'bug', 'FBI', 'terrorists', 'decide', 'kill', 'Cris', 'potential', 'threat', 'use', 'someone', 'close', 'hostage', 'bait', 'flush', 'out', 'action', 'pretty', 'much', 'non-stop', 'usually', 'highly', 'dramatic', 'original', 'twists', 'acting', 'mostly', 'pretty', 'good', 'odd', 'hole', 'plot', 'not', 'too', 'difficult', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'twist', 'end', 'very', 'clever.No', 'never', 'quite', 'explained', 'who', 'terrorists', 'are', 'what', 'objective', 'other', 'are', 'group', 'ruthless', 'highly', 'trained', 'well', 'equipped', 'french-speaking', 'caucasians', 'who', 'want', 'nuke', 'Southern', 'California', 'Sadly', 'world', 'are', 'living', 'today', 'presence', 'group', 'terrorists', 'supported', 'considerable', 'resources', 'who', 'are', 'prepared', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'including', 'loss', 'own', 'lives', 'blow', 'up', 'innocent', 'people', 'hardly', 'most', 'implausible', 'part', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'successful', 'box', 'office', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'especially', 'like', 'Sci-Fi', 'thrillers', 'enjoyed', 'Paycheck', 'Minority', 'Report', 'will', 'very', 'probably', 'Next']",N/A

Some Films of recent come to mind such as Deja Vu, Premenition, even the sappy romance of the Lake house.  I would even like to mention one of my personal favorites although utterly fantastic in a quantum physics way is Grand tour: Disaster in Time with Jeff Danials.  I missed Next in the Theater to many other blockbusters playing on multiple screens phased this action thriller off the big screen very quickly.  I thought the concept for this film (based on the story by Philip K. Dick) was very cool.  Chris Johnson aka Frank Cadillac (Cage) is a fortune telling magic act in vegas, who can also see 2 minutes into the future of his own life.  And if you can see the future you can change the present. Johnsons life of scamming the black jack tables and slot machines changes when the feds take notice of his abilities.  Incidently the opening sequence after Johnson foils a shooting in the casino(an incident the may have happened if Johnson had just let the event unfold as it did in his premonition) leads casino security on a cat and mouse through the casino watching johnson manuveur going on a 2 minute lead into the future to perfect timed escapes and dodges was more impressive then watching tom cruise duck authorities with the Pre-cog in Minority report.Johnson can only see 2 minutes into the future until he meets Liz(Beil), a fateful meeting based on a unusual premonition.  For some reason, that is never explained in this film he is able to see further into the future when he is in her presence. If you can just accept that as the way it is I think you'll enjoy this movie better.Thrills come hard and fast as Cage dodges the feds and foreign terrorists that have taken a nuclear munitions cache. which is why the feds want Johnson, to use his abilities to find said cache before it detonates.  Johnson cheats death numerous times along with a few embarrassing situations when he first meets Liz, as you see all the possibilites he initiates before choosing the one that works.  Next delivers the goods as far as thrills and shootem up action, and as a treat there is a little bit of a surprise before the end of the film which blew my mind, not a mind blowing as the end of the Sixth Sense, but still pretty cool.  Coolest special effect in this film is watching Johnson split apart from himself, creating multiple versions to check out all the possiblities of his surrounding and which way to go. And dodging bombs, snipers and other close shaves.Jessica beil is absolutely gorgeous as Liz(no surprise) a very girl next door type.  Julianne moore plays lead persuing FBI agent.This movie was entertaining despite some of the criticisms from mainstream magazines whose biggest complaint about Next was Nicolas Cages' Lame hairdo. Please, Next is suppose to be a science fiction/fantasy of coarse theres going to be some inconsistencies(like Cage being old enough to be Beils Father), but to that all I have to say is...Time Cop!Bottom Line....Entertaining.

Who are the terrorists, why are they blowing a nuclear bomb up in LA ? Without this information, all we have is Nicolas Cage and Julliane Moore running around chasing terrorists because these are bad people.As a big Jessica Biel fan, I have to ask what exactly she was doing in this film other than nearly being blown up by terrorists and having a quickie romance with Nicholas Cage...within the course of a couple of days. It felt like she was just kind of the generic good looking woman that could've been played by any number of actresses. Julliane Moore really brings it though as the hard nosed FBI agent desperate to stop terrorists from wiping out most of LA.That being said, Next has a lot of action packed into 96 minutes, so if your a fan of fast paced action and can make it beyond the delayed setup, than this movie may be just for you.

1089734,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000TGJ8A8,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","I've gamed with my share of psychic characters in various modern-day role-playing games, but for some reason male precogs has never gotten the same attention from Hollywood.  The clairvoyant types are always women or kids who talk to ghosts, with the exception of Stir of Echoes...which was about a guy who talked to ghosts. It was high time we had an action-packed, testosterone-injected update of the typical precog movie.Our hero, Chris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) is wandering around Vegas performing magic tricks.  Something is keeping him there: normally, Johnson can only see a few minutes into the future.  But when he encounters (or will encounter) Liz Cooper (the delectable Jessica Biel) at a diner, he discovers he can see his future with her, and only with her.  At heart, Next is a star-crossed romance.What's entertaining about this somewhat flimsy premise is that Johnson can make it work.  Nobody as hot as Cooper would normally be interested in shlubby Johnson, but he keeps trying alternate approaches, visualizing an endless array of possibilities, until he hits on the tactic that will work.As you can imagine, precognition is a lot like time travel, and it's difficult to visually pull off.  Next does an excellent job of showing what Johnson sees and the innovative ways he uses his gift; at one point, we see him splitting into multiple selves (representing all the possibilities of a particular course of action).  In combat, this is really fun to watch - since Johnson can see when someone will throw a punch, he can easily dodge the blow.  He can even dodge bullets.Into this tidy romance steps Callie Ferris (the usually gorgeous Julianne Moore, who looks terrible in this movie), a federal agent bent on using Johnson's powers to stop a nuclear bomb from going off.  The plot spins from there. The terrorists, who are tracking Ferris, figure that Johnson must be important because the government wants so desperately to speak with him, so they try to kill Johnson.  In other words, the movie is something of a closed loop - the whole reason Johnson gets involved is because people THINK he might be important, and thus he becomes important.Next has its flaws, however.  For one, Cage acts like he's in a daze.  His character is bland, confused, and a little addled - not in a cool, I-have-mental-powers sort of way, but an old-man-who-forgot-his-meds sort of way.  It's not very appealing, and strains the credibility of any attraction that Biel's character would have to him.Speaking of Biel, she's simply too attractive for the role.  At the time of the film, Biel was 25, Cage was 43.  They seem wildly mismatched in age, personality, and temperament. Biel does a good job acting bewildered and enchanted, but she's essentially making goo-goo eyes at a walking, talking zombie.The other problem is that Next simply doesn't have enough of a budget to pull off all the really cool special effects in the film.  The worst is when Johnson drives a stolen car in front of a train; the train, the car, and the crash look like they were made on a Commodore 64.  It takes away from an otherwise riveting scene.The bad guys are non-descript Eurotrash.  Their motivation is vague, although they seem to be so powerful that the bad guys even shadow the feds without being noticed.  No wonder the only person who can defeat them is a psychic!When Johsnon and Ferris team up, things really get going.  There's nothing like watching a precog and a sniper work in tandem.  Or a precog wending his way through a maze trapped with bombs.  Or a precog...well, you get the picture.  It's fun stuff.Throughout the movie, Next plays fast and loose with the timeline.  At any point in time, we're never sure if we're seeing the future or if Johnson is actually experiencing the future.

Using this ability to get by via gambling, Cris soon learns that a government agent (Julianne Moore) is after him to use him to track down terrorists and a stolen weapon, but all Cris has on his mind is a mysterious woman (Jessica Biel) whom he keeps seeing visions of.  Next does get off to a great start with some inventive storytelling that actually manages to echo Dick's ""The Golden Man"" story of which the film is based, but it sadly veers into a pretty predictable, glossy action yarn that doesn't suit the talents of the otherwise solid director Lee Tamahori (Die Another Day).  The villains (featuring the talented Thomas Kretschmann) get no depth at all, nor do many of the other characters besides Cris, and the film's ending will just leave you infuriated.  Still, Cage is actually pretty good, and Biel is surprisingly good as well, but neither can manage to save this flick.  All in all, Next is a disappointment in terms of being a fan of Philip K.

What else would they do?!) unless joyless FBI bigwig Agent Ferris (Moore) can force Chris to use his gift to stop les bad guys. Oh, and there's some pretty female called Liz (Biel) in there too, just for good measure.This is a terribly boring, poorly-made movie. There's no reason or setup for the bad guys, or their theft of the bomb, no explanation whatsoever behind Chris Johnson's prowess in physical combat and no chemistry at all from any one of the principal actors. The standards of dialogue and direction present in ""Next"" are so below par that, essentially, it feels like there's a good thirty minutes of plot missing - and a bad thirty minutes too many of Nicolas Cage dashing about being Nicolas Cage.Perhaps I missed part of this movie (even though I watched it all) or perhaps it's a sequel to something better, some other film with the missing pieces to this (boring, frustrating) puzzle?

That he has become a cheesy Vegas lounge-entertainer / mind-reader in order to elude the notice of the government is just unusual and plausible enough to amuse.  It's funny to see Cage on a chintzy stage, performing really bad mind-reading tricks.But we see these things in the first five minutes of the film...and it is straight downhill from there.  It's hard to say enough bad things.Let's start with Cage himself.  He can be a superb screen actor...over the years I've loved him in RAISING ARIZONA, MOONSTRUCK, LEAVING LAS VEGAS and especially ADAPTATION.  He was charming in PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED.  He brought solid quirkiness to THE ROCK and even the underwhelming NATIONAL SECURITY.  But he is on a huge loosing streak right now...GHOST RIDER was pretty bad, but WICKER MAN was laughable, and now NEXT allows him to reach absolute rock bottom.  It's hard to imagine an actor looking less interested or engaged in his work.  His hang-dog demeanor and droopy eyes now just simply make him look asleep.  He also has really bad hair...it makes Tom Hanks in DAVINCI CODE look positively stylish.  It is long and black...like bad spray-paint black...the type of hair-dye that community theaters buy at Walgreens.  And his skin has a thick layer of the most unconvincing ""tan"" foundation I've seen in a movie since the days of STAR TREK TOS.  He looks, frankly, like a man who is dying of a wasting disease and is trying to cover it.  I mostly worried for Nicholas Cage's health watching NEXT.  He's just hard to watch.Julianne Moore is just wasted.  She's been making some pretty poor choices lately...I guess the good roles she had been getting for awhile have run out.  I think back a few months to CHILDREN OF MEN...a movie I LOVED...and I remember even then thinking the tough, action-minded thing was not her strong suit.  Now I'm convinced of it.  She is a tough woman, but needs to play it with an edge of fragility.  That's what has always made her interesting.  She flounders a bit in underwritten, generic roles.  Jessica Biel, who helped her case as an actress with THE ILLUSIONIST, fails to convince in her silly role as a sensitive, unassuming young woman who teaches in the Native American villages around the Grand Canyon.  There are also ZERO sparks between her and Cage...but that's more the fault of bad writing and bad Cage.The plot goes from a trifling amusement to just plain ridiculous.  There are one or two good ideas...such as late in the film when Cage sends himself in many directions at once to see where the bad guys are hiding.  It's a rare moment of marginal originality.  The action sequences are few and far between.  The special effects are also fairly lame.  If you saw the previews for the movie and saw the huge explosion...that's it!  It made the film look almost like a disaster movie, with some expectation that the little snippet of film we saw was just a clip from more ambitious scenes of destruction.  Nope...you saw it ALL.Anyway, I've spent too much time on such a forgettable movie.  Do not see NEXT.

He comes up with some truly fascinating and philosophically challenging scenarios, usually in a ""science fiction-ish""/futuristic kind of setting.  This movie takes the idea of seeing into the future--cleverly just two minutes--and does too little with it.  Or too much.  That's where I get confused.  The idea of Frank Cadillac seeing just two minutes into the future is inherently fascinating, since the unlimited foresight idea has been done before.  The writers tried to make the story too complicated, though, leaving it unfinished and/or incomplete.Some of my quick hits:-- Julianne Moore's considerable talent is largely wasted, and her character could have been played well by other actresses.  Her dialogue and intentions are way too melodramatic, which just complicates things for the worse.-- The terrorist angle just seems too ""complicated,"" especially with the whole idea not being explained well in the first place.  It could have been a nice drama and/or a nice romantic movie; it also might have been a good terrorist/action kind of movie; but it didn't work as both (or all three).-- Some of the dialogue was just horribly clunky in spots, typical of Dick's writing.  Very distracting for me.-- The special effects were in and out, fascinating at times, switching in and out of now/then.  Other times it looked like something I would film in my back yard:  the truck falling down the hill. . . .-- Unlike some, I was OK with the ending, even though it may have borrowed from other movies.  What movie doesn't. . . ?-- Great Line:""They killed her.  Two hours from now.""  (As an English teacher, I love the playing around with verb tenses.)Overall I guess I enjoyed it, but more out of loyalty to Philip K. Dick than to the quality of the movie.  It wasn't horrible, but it just didn't work great for me.  Make up your mind:  a ""24""/Jack Bauer-ish anti-terrorist action movie OR a Matrix-ish special effects-fest OR a romantic-ish kind of movie with a twist of foresight OR a simple drama with Cadillac's gift of foresight contributing to a crime hunt or his own personal quest for a good life.  Too much switching from genre to genre within a movie becomes distracting, leaving each segment unfulfilled.  Definitely worth a watch for those who have followed Philip K.

Dick (probably the most frequently adapted writer of the past thirty years), ""Next"" starts off with what would appear to be a can't-miss, sure-fire premise.  In yet another in what is fast becoming a long string of unchallenging roles, Nicolas Cage plays Cris Johnson, a Vegas magician with the uncanny ability to see two minutes into his own future.  So far, he's used this talent only as a part of his stage act and as a means of beating the house at gambling when he heads to the local casinos.  But now he's being asked by the FBI to employ his unique skill in helping to thwart a terrorist plot to detonate a nuclear bomb in downtown Los Angeles.  Cris, however, wants nothing whatsoever to do with saving the world (for reasons that are never made entirely convincing for the audience), so he's off and running through the greater Southwest with both the feds and the bad guys hot on his trail.

Even on a plot level, this gimmicky movie rarely plays fair with its audience, having Cris perform amazing feats that have little or nothing to do with his ability to read the future.

We probably went for fun, not really expecting to see a miracle or see into our future. Few of us will take a palm reader or a psychic seriously. There is a cartoon I once saw of a psychic opening shop and advertising in big letters on the shop's front window, `Opening day: See your future. Only $20.' One week later, the big letters on the window said, `See your future. Only $10.' Two weeks later, the letters now formed the following combination of words: `See your future. Only $2.' On the third week, the shop was dark, with the letters on its front window now saying, `Bankrupt.' Obviously this psychic could not see the future.But what if, out of the millions of psychics, palm readers, and magicians out there a few are for real? What if some of us could actually take a glimpse of the future, or achieve some amazing feat? Are all magic tricks just that, tricks? Or do some magicians practice real magic, like Harry Potter for example?This movie is about just such a man, gifted to see two minutes into his own future, but days ahead when it comes to his loved one.Terrorists have planted an Atomic bomb somewhere on American soil, and the FBI seeks Cris Johnson (played by Nicolas Cage), to help them see into the future and try to tell them the location of the bomb. However, Johnson refuses to cooperate, since he can only see two minutes ahead of his own future only, and thus feels he will be unable to help them. Wrongly accused of trying to kill a man at a casino, and videotaped holding a gun, he becomes sort of a fugitive. With his ability to see two minutes into his own future, he is able to evade capture, since he knows ahead of time his captors' position and intentions. To complicate things further, the bad guys are also trying to kill Johnson, fearing that he might actually have the ability to see into the future and thus know ahead of time the location of the bomb.This is really a roller-coaster of a thriller that will keep you at the edge of your seat. There are many twists in the movie that will keep you guessing at what will happen next. `Next' is what's it all about.Next time you go to a magic show, or visit a palm reader or psychic, just wonder at the possibility that you may have stumbled on the odd-man out.

In real life it's a rare ability that some people have in some particular area(s).Cage's character, who uses his ability to perform magic tricks in a stenchy Las Vegas downtown casino, has been waiting for his true love (Jessica Biel) for years and he saw her in his mind for years. Once he meets her in a Diner, his abilities extend to see the future a couple of hours in advance, and he realizes that based on his actions he can change the immediate future to some extent.And that's the interesting part of the film to see various possible outcomes of the immediate future if he, Cage's character, makes this or that decision/action at the moment. This flick is executed very well, and yes, because Cage being an Elvis fan to the bone, there's some Elvis touch in there. Nicolas Cage, who years ago I wouldn't have cared to see him in any movie, has grown as an actor and again delivers a superb performance - he's really a great actor.Julian Moore wasn't too exciting as she plays a special FBI agent or something, but her character and performance seems flat. Also, the script had its problems with some lose ends here and there as well as some high-school quality dialogue with the lines of the supporting actors at times.Jessica Biel is appealing as usual and she ads color and brings life/authenticty to the film.The overall storyline of the nuclear bomb threat seems somewhat of an afterthought, but that's okay, because I think the main issue is that phenomenon of certain people having the ability to see briefly ahead for a few seconds or a minute and making certain decisions based on such an ability, while in this flick of course the ability is Hollywood overemphasized, but it's a movie.

You know, with so many holes that they're almost par for the course, but the overall experience is one of momentary delight anyway. You savor it, then you go on your merry way. Suspend disbelief for best results.The whole crux of the movie is the FBI's frenetic hunt for a bunch of handsome European miscreants (sporting a bouquet of dialects) who're about to detonate a nuclear warhead in or around LA. The reason? Not sure. Perhaps to make a big bada boom. Perhaps to look real scary. We will never know, nor, I suspect, would the FBI team from the film. But that's not to stop them from acting all pensive and thriller-like. It showers much of the spotlight on light humor involving the protagonist and his love interest instead. He's a magician with a special skill that you should find out for yourself, and she's, well, magical. Some liberal scatter-shot editing follows, but it's a fun ride. The visuals of the Grand Canyon (that's what they were I presume?) are breathtaking. The ending credits roll does justice to the theme, and may get a final round of laughter.There is no way this film merits a serious review, but I will take the time to report one serious gripe: the hairstyles! Tom Hanks may have done an enormous disfavor to the cinematic community by sporting his little rumpled tuft in Da Vinci Code, which seems to have taken off -- Jim Carrie in 23, and now Nicholas Cage here. Time for some scissors, Hollywood!

1089775,A267RZGUQ6KM2L,B000TGJ8A8,Terrell T. Gibbs,"[21, 21]","Next is a movie based on a classic science fiction theme, the ""small"" wild talent. It is based on a short story by Philip K Dick, the great science fiction writer whose stories have inspired numerous movies; works by Dick were also the basis for ""Blade Runner"" (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep), ""Total Recall"" (We Can Remember It For You Wholesale), ""Minority Report,"" and ""A Scanner Darkly,"" among others, Nick Cage plays Frank Cadillac, a Las Vegas stage mentalist who can actually see the future; the catch is that he can normally only see his own future, and only 2 minutes ahead. He has made a life living ""under the radar,"" exploiting his talent in minor ways, until a rare precognitive glimpse beyond his 2 minute horizon reveals to him the woman that he is destined to be with.The film is extraordinarily well crafted, gradually introducing the audience to the nature of Frank's power. There is a terrorist nuclear bomb subplot that provides a major plot motivator. With ""24"" now in its 6th season, this is already beginning to seem a bit tired as a plot device. Nevertheless it keeps things moving and offers Cage's character a fundamental dilemma: what good is a 2 minute warning against a nuclear bomb? In addition, Frank is being chased by Julianne Moore as a federal agent who has figured out Frank's talent and hopes to use it to find the bomb. I found this to be the one serious plot weakness, in that there is not enough of a backstory to explain how Moore's character has become so convinced that she absolutely must have Frank on her side to stop the bomb.Initially, we see only the effects of Frank's power as he effortlessly evades capture in some beautifully crafted chase scenes, but as the film proceeds, we begin to become privy to Frank's glimpses of the future. I can't recall whether I ever read the Phil Dick story (The Golden Man) that the film is based upon, but it introduces a type of uncertainty that Dick loved to play with, in that we become less and less certain whether we are viewing the actual present or one of the many alternative futures that Frank sees. For Frank, the future has almost a Schrodinger's Cat quality, since just by looking at his future, he changes it. There is a wonderful scene toward the end in which Frank becomes a sort of quantum cloud of alternative Franks working his way through a booby-trapped factory.The reviews I saw for this movie were not impressive, but film reviewers have always tended to have trouble appreciating Phil Dick. I thought that it was pretty nearly perfect. The ending, which I won't reveal, might strike some as a bit of a ""bait-and-switch"" but I thought that it worked perfectly, because by that time I was very much into Franks mindset in which possible futures become as real as present experience. There is one scene in which Jessica Biehl's character says something like, ""life should be a surprise,"" and Frank says wistfully, ""That would be nice.""The acting is top notch. Cage clearly appreciates science fiction, and is listed as a producer, and he is very convincing as Frank. Biehl and Julianne Moore round out the strong cast.Be sure and stay for the credits, by the way; there is a minor joke.The concept of the two minute warning is a great one, and my only real complaint about the movie is that I'd like to see this idea played out at even greater length. Perhaps Cage will consider producing a TV series with a similar character.",5,Classic science fiction,1178928000,"05 12, 2007",2007,3439,"['Next', 'movie', 'based', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'theme', 'small', 'wild', 'talent', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Philip', 'K', 'Dick', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'writer', 'stories', 'have', 'inspired', 'numerous', 'movies', 'works', 'Dick', 'were', 'also', 'basis', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Do', 'Androids', 'Dream', 'Electric', 'Sheep', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Can', 'Remember', 'Wholesale', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'others', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'Frank', 'Cadillac', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'stage', 'mentalist', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'future', 'catch', 'can', 'normally', 'only', 'see', 'own', 'future', 'only', '2', 'minutes', 'ahead', 'made', 'life', 'living', 'radar', 'exploiting', 'talent', 'minor', 'ways', 'rare', 'precognitive', 'glimpse', '2', 'minute', 'horizon', 'reveals', 'woman', 'destined', 'be', 'with.The', 'film', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'crafted', 'gradually', 'introducing', 'audience', 'nature', 'Frank', 'power', 'terrorist', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'subplot', 'major', 'plot', 'motivator', '24', 'now', '6th', 'season', 'already', 'beginning', 'seem', 'bit', 'tired', 'plot', 'device', 'things', 'moving', 'Cage', 'character', 'fundamental', 'dilemma', 'what', 'good', '2', 'minute', 'warning', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'addition', 'Frank', 'being', 'chased', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'federal', 'agent', 'who', 'figured', 'out', 'Frank', 'talent', 'hopes', 'use', 'find', 'bomb', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'serious', 'plot', 'weakness', 'not', 'enough', 'backstory', 'explain', 'how', 'Moore', 'character', 'become', 'so', 'convinced', 'absolutely', 'must', 'have', 'Frank', 'side', 'stop', 'bomb.Initially', 'see', 'only', 'effects', 'Frank', 'power', 'effortlessly', 'capture', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'chase', 'scenes', 'film', 'proceeds', 'begin', 'become', 'privy', 'Frank', 'glimpses', 'future', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'read', 'Phil', 'Dick', 'story', 'Golden', 'Man', 'film', 'based', 'type', 'uncertainty', 'Dick', 'loved', 'play', 'become', 'less', 'less', 'certain', 'are', 'viewing', 'actual', 'present', 'one', 'many', 'alternative', 'futures', 'Frank', 'Frank', 'future', 'almost', 'Schrodinger', 'Cat', 'quality', 'just', 'looking', 'future', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'end', 'Frank', 'sort', 'quantum', 'cloud', 'alternative', 'Franks', 'working', 'way', 'booby-trapped', 'factory.The', 'reviews', 'saw', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'impressive', 'film', 'reviewers', 'have', 'always', 'tended', 'have', 'trouble', 'appreciating', 'Phil', 'Dick', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'might', 'strike', 'bit', 'bait-and-switch', 'thought', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'Franks', 'mindset', 'possible', 'futures', 'become', 'as', 'real', 'present', 'experience', 'one', 'scene', 'Jessica', 'Biehl', 'character', 'something', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'surprise', 'Frank', 'wistfully', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'Cage', 'clearly', 'science', 'fiction', 'listed', 'producer', 'very', 'convincing', 'Frank', 'Biehl', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'round', 'out', 'strong', 'cast.Be', 'sure', 'stay', 'credits', 'way', 'minor', 'joke.The', 'concept', 'two', 'minute', 'warning', 'great', 'one', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'movie', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'idea', 'played', 'out', 'even', 'greater', 'length', 'Perhaps', 'Cage', 'will', 'consider', 'producing', 'TV', 'series', 'similar', 'character']",N/A
1089776,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000TGJ8A8,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 2]","With a title like ""Next"" hopefully the studio is prepared for the inevitable ridicule likely to afflict their movie, unless it transcends its trite name with spectacular substance and quality. It doesn't. However, Nicolas Cage's most recent actioner does contain an ample amount of thrills and an intricate storyline that is surprisingly unpredictable for a movie whose main character (and therefore the audience) can see two minutes into the future. But if you learn anything from this movie, it's that it doesn't really matter what happens Next.Based on the short story The Golden Man by Philip K. Dick, Next follows the precarious life of Cris Johnson (Nicolas Cage), a man both gifted and tormented by his unique ability to see a few minutes into his future. To stay off the radar of those wishing to exploit his powers, Johnson poses as a magician in Las Vegas and supplements his income with risk-free gambling. Desperate to avoid a nuclear terrorist attack on Los Angeles, FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) begins a search for the magician in order to use his intuitive prowess to discover the precise target location. Initially unwilling to help, Cris is eventually apprehended by Callie and agrees to cooperate to save the girl he loves from a horrifying fate. But even with his superhuman intuition and the aid of the FBI, will Cris be able to reach her in time? Does it even matter?A quick narration by Cage informs the viewer of Cris Johnson's powerful premonitions and sets strict parameters concerning his abilities. He can only see the events pertaining to his own life and then only for two minutes in advance. Then probably less than that amount of time later, they break these rules and every possible exception is made, posing the question of why guidelines were introduced at all. Even with such a premise, Next manages to keep the audience guessing - a feat more impressive than it sounds, and if you can see the ending coming then this movie was probably based off of you. But unexpected unpredictability aside, many sequences will probably remind you of effects and situations from such predecessors as Minority Report, The Matrix, and D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu, and that same startling conclusion ultimately negates everything the movie worked so hard to build and cements the concept that it doesn't really matter how the movie ends, so long as it is wholly unsatisfying.Of the condensed cast, Cage is easily the most interesting character, but not because of his visionistic aptitude, but rather his sarcastic humor and cocky bravado. With the ability to see the future, no matter how brief, Cris is a force to be reckoned with, and many of the most entertaining sequences are such due to the displays of those powers, be it in combat or in wooing Jessica Biel. Moore is adequate as the domineering FBI agent, though her talents seem wasted after her performance in Children of Men. Biel lends her attractiveness and little else as Cage's mysteriously fated girlfriend and proves Cage moves fast with the charm - but to be fair he does only have 96 minutes to get the girl and save the world. As for the antagonists, a more stereotypically lackluster and standard group of villains one would be hard pressed to find, although the random mix of languages they speak, including French, is anything but typical from Hollywood terrorists.With a plot so outlandishly realized that you can't help but wonder what will happen next, Lee Tamahori's sci-fi thriller seems destined for something greater, but stumbles with a conclusion equal parts inventive, unanticipated, and unfulfilling. Bouts of clever dialogue and fun action only go so far, and while the film stretches these elements to their limits, several bland characters and an unfortunately ridiculous execution of interesting concepts produces a movie that feels more like the last thing you saw and less like the Next.- Joel Massie, MoviePulse.net",2,Next Movie Review from MoviePulse.net,1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,3931,"['title', 'Next', 'hopefully', 'studio', 'prepared', 'inevitable', 'ridicule', 'likely', 'afflict', 'movie', 'trite', 'name', 'spectacular', 'substance', 'quality', ""n't"", 'However', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'most', 'recent', 'actioner', 'contain', 'ample', 'amount', 'thrills', 'intricate', 'storyline', 'surprisingly', 'unpredictable', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'therefore', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'two', 'minutes', 'future', 'learn', 'anything', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'what', 'Next.Based', 'short', 'story', 'Golden', 'Man', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'Next', 'precarious', 'life', 'Cris', 'Johnson', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'man', 'gifted', 'tormented', 'unique', 'ability', 'see', 'few', 'minutes', 'future', 'stay', 'radar', 'wishing', 'exploit', 'powers', 'Johnson', 'magician', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'supplements', 'income', 'risk-free', 'gambling', 'Desperate', 'avoid', 'nuclear', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Callie', 'Ferris', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'search', 'magician', 'order', 'use', 'intuitive', 'prowess', 'discover', 'precise', 'target', 'location', 'Initially', 'unwilling', 'help', 'Cris', 'eventually', 'apprehended', 'Callie', 'cooperate', 'save', 'girl', 'horrifying', 'fate', 'even', 'superhuman', 'intuition', 'aid', 'FBI', 'will', 'Cris', 'be', 'able', 'reach', 'time', 'even', 'matter', 'quick', 'narration', 'Cage', 'informs', 'viewer', 'Cris', 'Johnson', 'powerful', 'premonitions', 'sets', 'strict', 'parameters', 'concerning', 'abilities', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'events', 'pertaining', 'own', 'life', 'then', 'only', 'two', 'minutes', 'advance', 'Then', 'probably', 'less', 'amount', 'time', 'later', 'break', 'rules', 'possible', 'exception', 'made', 'posing', 'question', 'why', 'guidelines', 'were', 'introduced', 'Even', 'premise', 'Next', 'manages', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'feat', 'more', 'impressive', 'can', 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'then', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'based', 'unexpected', 'unpredictability', 'aside', 'many', 'sequences', 'will', 'probably', 'remind', 'effects', 'situations', 'such', 'predecessors', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Matrix', 'D', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'Vu', 'same', 'startling', 'conclusion', 'ultimately', 'everything', 'movie', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'build', 'cements', 'concept', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'how', 'movie', 'so', 'long', 'wholly', 'unsatisfying.Of', 'condensed', 'cast', 'Cage', 'easily', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'not', 'visionistic', 'aptitude', 'rather', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'cocky', 'bravado', 'ability', 'see', 'future', 'matter', 'how', 'brief', 'Cris', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'many', 'most', 'entertaining', 'sequences', 'are', 'such', 'due', 'displays', 'powers', 'be', 'combat', 'wooing', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Moore', 'adequate', 'domineering', 'FBI', 'agent', 'talents', 'seem', 'wasted', 'performance', 'Children', 'Men', 'Biel', 'attractiveness', 'little', 'else', 'Cage', 'mysteriously', 'fated', 'girlfriend', 'Cage', 'moves', 'fast', 'charm', 'be', 'fair', 'only', 'have', '96', 'minutes', 'get', 'girl', 'save', 'world', 'antagonists', 'more', 'stereotypically', 'lackluster', 'standard', 'group', 'villains', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'random', 'mix', 'languages', 'speak', 'including', 'French', 'anything', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'terrorists.With', 'plot', 'so', 'outlandishly', 'realized', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'Lee', 'Tamahori', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'destined', 'something', 'greater', 'conclusion', 'equal', 'parts', 'inventive', 'unanticipated', 'unfulfilling', 'Bouts', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'fun', 'action', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'film', 'elements', 'limits', 'several', 'bland', 'characters', 'unfortunately', 'ridiculous', 'execution', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'movie', 'more', 'last', 'thing', 'saw', 'less', 'Next.-', 'Joel', 'Massie', 'MoviePulse.net']",N/A

1089778,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000TGJ8A8,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 4]","""Next"", the latest cinematic bon-bon from Nicholas Cage, is not a great movie, but it is a pleasant diversion, and suitable bargain matinee material. It's also fun to see Cage's latest bad toupee.Cris (Cage), using the stage name Frank Cadillac, performs cheap tricks in a run down Las Vegas nightclub, under a stage name, to hide his real talent. He is certain that if the government, the `enemy', anyone, discover the nature of this talent, he will lose his freedom and be forced to work for them in order to live. His talent? He can see the future. Granted, he can only see about two minutes into the future, but this is still a valuable skill. There is only one problem. The government already knows he has this power. Callie Farris (Julianne Moore), an FBI agent, has learned that a nuclear bomb missing from the Russian Federation is on its way to America and wants, needs Cris to help them determine when and where it will go off. But Cris has dreams of a beautiful young lady, Liz (Jessica Biel) in a diner and shows up every day, determined to meet her. When Cris finally does meet Liz, he conspires to get her to take him to Flagstaff, because he knows she is headed there. Naturally, Farris and her arsenal of FBI employees are hot on their heels. Oh, and the terrorists, led by Mr. Smith (Thomas Kretschmann, ""King Kong"") know about Cris as well and want to stop him, because they know he can foil their plans.""Next"", directed by Lee Tamahori (""Once Were Warriors"", ""Die Another Day"") and based on a story by Philip K. Dick (who wrote the story that would become ""Bladerunner""), takes a completely implausible premise (with more than a few plot holes - how do the terrorists know about Cris?) and makes it an enjoyable piece of fluff to help while away a few hours. Actually, scratch that. An enjoyable piece of fluff to while away 100 minutes. This is one of the reasons ""Next"" was more enjoyable than I had any right to expect. It was relatively short for a film in this genre, most run two hours or longer, so it kept the action moving.Cris is introduced doing his two-bit magic act at a rundown lounge in a rundown casino in downtown Vegas. He uses a stage name, Frank Cadillac, and gets paid in cash, all in an effort to stay off the radar. To earn extra money, he uses his skill at the tables, earning just enough to make some good cash and not attract any attention. Yet, the casino security people are watching Cris. Even as Cris says he is trying to stay under the radar, he seems to know the casino is watching him. Does he have premonitions as well? He knows that as soon as his ability is revealed, his freedom will be jeopardized, so he tries to stay low key. Naturally, this doesn't work for long. Farris and her assistant are in the audience watching the show. And everyone seems to realize there is a limitation to Cris' ability.This is another of Cage's one-note performances. Throughout the entire film, he seems to be grimacing (in pain? shock?), his face blank and his eyes vacant. But this sort of works for Cris. He is always looking into the future, and these images seem to dull his opinion of the world. Also, he is fairly certain that if his ability is revealed, he will end up in a padded room under observation, so he has to remain fairly low-key.It's sad that the most interesting thing about Cage's performances, lately, is anticipating how bad his toupee will look. In ""Next"", he has longer hair, slightly greasy looking, which fits his character well, but still looks exceedingly fake.Because Cris can only see a few minutes into the future, he has fairly limited ability, yet he is able to use this ability to elude pursuers. And this leads to some interesting action scenes. As Cris engages in foot chases or a car chase, he is always able to make the right move, at the right moment, to elude his attackers. This helps to explain his almost `super human' ability to stay out of harm's way. Particularly impressive is how he ducks and weaves, much like a martial arts expert, to elude punches, bullets, falling logs, etc.But this same `two minute rule' leads to the biggest plot hole in the film. Moore's Farris wants Cris' help to locate the stolen nuclear weapon. When Cris finally agrees to help Farris, she plants him in a medical chair in a concrete room wearing glasses that prop his eyes open. Someone wearing a medical jacket puts some drops in his eyes and he can suddenly see further than two minutes into the future. Huh? Actually, in the beginning of the film, he has dreams of Liz (Biel) showing up at a diner at a specific time on a day, yet he doesn't know which day. Clearly, he is already seeing a few days into the future, so this becomes a sloppy plot point, a huge hole in the story. Why is he suddenly able to see further into the future than he was previously? To give the filmmakers more latitude with the story? The filmmakers created this universe; if they needed Cris to be able to see further into the future, make his skills more ambiguous in the first place. Don't simply change the rules after they are established.I think we were supposed to forget about the vision of Liz once Cris has established contact with her. Biel's character then simply becomes a damsel in distress.Julianne Moore is fine, but unexceptional as Farris. Throughout, she remains steely and determined to find the nuclear weapon, no matter what the cost. Because of this, she shows little emotion when some of her team members die in the line of duty. See, she is trying to prevent a bigger loss (millions of innocent people are at risk. Millions!), so the loss of a couple of team members is a small price to pay.Why is Julianne Moore taking roles in films like ""Next""? This is essentially the same type of role she played in ""Children of Men"" (a much better film) to lesser effect here. This is the role Alec Baldwin or Danny Glover generally walk through when they are simply collecting a paycheck. Has Moore really been reduced to that? Collecting paychecks? Julianne, hold out for better roles. If you aren't careful one of the television networks will soon be announcing the premiere of your new television series.The one good thing about her character is she trusts Cris' vision and stops when he tells her too, orders her underlings to pay attention to the two-bit magician, and more. She takes his ability seriously and it helps save her life more than once. So often, people second guess the heroes ability repeatedly, despite evidence to the contrary.Jessica Biel continues her quest to perfect the `pretty damsel in distress' role, the type of role where the character becomes little more than a damsel in distress. As the girl in Cris' vision, she is his ideal of the perfect woman. But since we know Cris has seen her, and he can see in the future, he will no doubt do exactly what is required to win her love and admiration, which isn't much. It seems they are in bed together fairly soon after meeting. But of course, this helps to make her a more important pawn in the story; the villains can use her now that Cris has fallen in love with her.Peter Falk even pops up and totters around for a few minutes. What connection his character has to the story is unclear; he seems to be some sort of mentor to Cris' character. But after the action gets going, we never see or here from him again.The best thing about ""Next"" is the action sequences and Cris' ability to be able to weave through them without harm. Particularly impressive is a chase down a hillside involving many different items careening down the slope after our heroes and the villains, logs, trucks, boulders. They even manage to throw a huge stagecoach into the mix, sort of like throwing in the kitchen sink for good measure.The ending has an interesting plot twist. On the one hand, it piques my interest. On the other, it almost seems like the filmmakers ran out of money and had to simply end the film. But Tamahori does this with more skill than I am describing. If I went into too much detail, it would spoil it.""Next"" is a better film than I was expecting, and I wasn't expecting much. That said, it is a fun bargain matinee for action junkies who won't mind or notice the plot holes. Although they are as huge as the Grand Canyon, which also makes an appearance in the film.",3,"2 1/2 - The ""Next"" Project for Cage?

1089782,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000TGJ8A8,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Next"" is an action film built on an intriguing sci-fi concept. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Cris Johnson, a Las Vegas ""magician"" who can see the future. Actually, he can see only two minutes into the future, but his uncanny ability would be still useful for some people, like an FBI agent played by Julianne Moore, chasing a group of terrorists who have smuggled a nuclear bomb into America.Yes, the film's story is implausible, full of plot holes and sometimes the ""two-minutes-into-the-future"" idea seems totally forgotten, but once action gets started, the film is entertaining. I really enjoyed watching Cage's hero evading dangers, running (or walking) away from guards hiding behind objects in a casino, or dodging numerous objects flying and falling (including a bullet) in the cliffside scene. One humorous scene has him trying to talk to his love interest, a beautiful teacher named Liz (played by Jessica Biel) that reminds us of ""Groundhog Day.""Unfortunately, Cris' romance turns out one of the weakest parts of the film. The heroine is too generic to make the love story interesting and though Nicolas Cage's character remains likeable and watchable, most characters in ""Next"" are colorless or given too short time to shine like Peter Falk's. We are not allowed to know even the motives or backgrounds of the terrorists. Special effects are not very impressive and some of them look hurriedly done.While watching the film, I was wondering: ""Why didn't they use Julianne Moore's no-nonsense FBI agent as Cage's possible love interest, who is definitely a more interesting character than Biel's. You know this is not a masterpiece, but you will also find this film could have been much better, more thrilling with minor changes. Perhaps that is why some people (including me) didn't like the ending, which looks a bit abrupt.I'm not saying ""Next"" is a terrible film (especially after seeing ""The Wicker Man,"" which it is.) But the film still needs more actions, more chemistry between Cage and Biel, and most of all, like ""Ghost Rider,"" more original ways to make use of the hero's unique abilities.",3,"Nicholas Cage Seeing Two Minutes into the Future: Entertaining, But Not Great",1209513600,"04 30, 2008",2008,2113,"['Next', 'action', 'film', 'built', 'intriguing', 'sci-fi', 'concept', 'film', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Cris', 'Johnson', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'magician', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'Actually', 'can', 'see', 'only', 'two', 'minutes', 'future', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'would', 'be', 'still', 'useful', 'people', 'FBI', 'agent', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'chasing', 'group', 'terrorists', 'who', 'have', 'smuggled', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'America.Yes', 'film', 'story', 'implausible', 'full', 'plot', 'holes', 'two-minutes-into-the-future', 'idea', 'totally', 'forgotten', 'once', 'action', 'started', 'film', 'entertaining', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Cage', 'hero', 'evading', 'dangers', 'running', 'walking', 'away', 'guards', 'hiding', 'objects', 'casino', 'dodging', 'numerous', 'objects', 'flying', 'falling', 'including', 'bullet', 'cliffside', 'scene', 'One', 'humorous', 'scene', 'trying', 'talk', 'love', 'interest', 'beautiful', 'teacher', 'named', 'Liz', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Unfortunately', 'Cris', 'romance', 'out', 'one', 'weakest', 'parts', 'film', 'heroine', 'too', 'generic', 'make', 'love', 'story', 'interesting', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'character', 'likeable', 'watchable', 'most', 'characters', 'Next', 'are', 'colorless', 'given', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'shine', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'know', 'even', 'motives', 'backgrounds', 'terrorists', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'impressive', 'look', 'hurriedly', 'done.While', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'wondering', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'no-nonsense', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Cage', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'definitely', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'Biel', 'know', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'thrilling', 'minor', 'changes', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'people', 'including', 'did', ""n't"", 'ending', 'bit', 'abrupt.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Next', 'terrible', 'film', 'especially', 'seeing', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'film', 'still', 'more', 'actions', 'more', 'chemistry', 'Cage', 'Biel', 'most', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'more', 'original', 'ways', 'make', 'use', 'hero', 'unique', 'abilities']",N/A
