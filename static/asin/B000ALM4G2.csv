Escpecially ""Hollywood Nicky"" which was played by Puffy ! Where the Original was filmed with style and elegance and Class! This one comes across as a low budget urban film! The script was pretty rotton but in essience entertaining if you don't compare it to The Original ! This Film is no different from any other shoot em up ganster striaght to video drug movie ! They just attached the name ""Calito's way"" to it ! Rent this at best ! I payed $4 for it and I felt I got my money's worth ! The film quality is poor, and it has that fade in to the next scene camera effect like a tv movie ! Anytime on two seperate occasions in the film, Drug dealers walk into a bar and shoot someone one infront of witnesses ! And no one is arrested for the murders and there not even looked for ? And ""Puffy"" stood there saying this can happen to you ? You got to laugh ! That was worth the $ 4 in it self ! And some things were just illogical in the movie made no sense at all ! If you almost got your tongue cut out your mouth for talking crazy ! why would you go kidnapp the guy knowing he is part of a big Italian Drug family? And you are nothing but a wannabee Black Probitionist with zero Backup? Why in the end was Carlito retired when the original film opened she was in jail for still dealing ? There was no attempt to align this with the original to meet it even half way. And none of the same characters at all ! I think this movie was already in the making and they decided to just slap Carlito as the main character in it ! Or the director never watched the original just heard about it!

927747,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B000ALM4G2,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 10/08Rate: 410/08: When I saw Carlito's Way, I was impressed with the performance of Al Pacino and the typical direction of Brian De Palma. Of course, after that, Carlito's Way: Rise to Power got made and shouldn't be expected to meet the standard. That turned out to be correct. Mainly, I thought the sequel was okay but slightly below average. It wasn't boring, I give them that. The problem with Carlito's Way: Rise to Power is that I didn't care very much. The performances ranged from corny to all right but nothing special. Sean ""Puffy (Piffy, Diffy, Whatever)"" Combs should never be permitted to act again. He just can't do it. Just because the characters wear 70's clothes and the 70's cars are seen doesn't change the fact how painfully obvious the 21st century the movie's look is. Even worse, the dialogues weren't of the standard either. Although Luis Guzman was in the original, I kept trying to remember how he is connected to the story in Carlito's Way: Rise to Power until I found out that it's the same actor playing two totally different characters. Way to go, fellas. Carlito's Way started the movie by showing Al Pacino giving a speech in court for some crime, but Carlito's Way: Rise to Power doesn't end to give a leeway to the previous film. Rather, it ends showing paradise for Carlito; so, what happened? Was paradise not enough for him? Even worse, the characters from the original aren't shown in Carlito's Way: Rise to Power. That's disappointing too. One thing is funny about Carlito's Way: Rise to Power is how that guy kept looking like Sylvester Stallone or maybe Dean Martin. Yeah, only if you look away a bit and use your peripheral vision. Probably the credit goes to Burt Young for striking that.

He actually has the Pacino lingo down in his voice-over narration(its actually pretty good, he sounds like Pacinos Carlito), but hes off the mark here and there in his performance trying to move, talk and act like Pacino, and it comes off half cocked. If your going to play Pacino then play Pacino all the way. Here it seems like he couldnt find that sweet spot between doing Pacino and doing Carlito, hes usually almost there but off the mark. But it was a decent effort over all. Beyond that one might wonder what the point was about making this film in the first place except that probably someone felt that De Palmas film simply didnt include much of what the book did and it might be a good idea for a movie. De Palmas film was really very good, and over all a better than average gangster picture, but not so good that it warranted any sort of sequel, let alone a prequel.

For one the original had top notch actors from top to bottom (It's amazing how they managed to squeeze Luis Guzman in this one being that he was in the original).  To all those wanting to know why they didn't spotlight Benny Blanco from the Bronx is because this is a PRE-QUEL.  Not a SEQUEL.  Big difference.As you should know, in the original Carlito's Way, Benny Blanco was the new Kingfish on the block during Carlito's last couple years of serving time until he was released.  However, Blanco looked up to Carlito, admired him, and wanted to be like him until Carlito dissed him in public.  Being that this is a pre-quel and it's spotlighting Carlito's early years and how he gained his rise to power, Benny Blanco would have probably been in elementary or junior high school at best.  No need to waste film spotlighting that.  Now if they do a sequel, then yes, you would have to spotlight Benny.Puffy being in this movie was a joke.  I could think of several real actors that could have easily took that role to another level.  But other than that, I loved the connection to the original and it was entertaining enough.If you like British mob movies, Layer Cake is also a keeper.",3,Nothing Tops The Original,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,1314,"['actually', 'was', 'entertaining', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'watered', 'as', 'expected', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'top', 'original', 'one', 'original', 'had', 'top', 'notch', 'actors', 'top', 'bottom', 'amazing', 'how', 'managed', 'squeeze', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'one', 'being', 'was', 'original', 'wanting', 'know', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'spotlight', 'Benny', 'Blanco', 'Bronx', 'PRE-QUEL', 'Not', 'SEQUEL', 'Big', 'difference.As', 'should', 'know', 'original', 'Carlito', 'Way', 'Benny', 'Blanco', 'was', 'new', 'Kingfish', 'block', 'Carlito', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'serving', 'time', 'was', 'released', 'However', 'Blanco', 'looked', 'up', 'Carlito', 'admired', 'wanted', 'be', 'Carlito', 'dissed', 'public', 'Being', 'pre-quel', 'spotlighting', 'Carlito', 'early', 'years', 'how', 'gained', 'rise', 'power', 'Benny', 'Blanco', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'elementary', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'best', 'need', 'waste', 'film', 'spotlighting', 'Now', 'do', 'sequel', 'then', 'yes', 'would', 'have', 'spotlight', 'Benny.Puffy', 'being', 'movie', 'was', 'joke', 'could', 'think', 'several', 'real', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'took', 'role', 'level', 'other', 'loved', 'connection', 'original', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough.If', 'British', 'mob', 'movies', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'also', 'keeper']",N/A

The acting in the film is okay, but it suffers so much compared to the Pacino/Penn film.  The climax was very bland.  The one thing I wish they would have explained better was how Carlito became friends with the Italian mobster and the African American bookie.  They were both very successful people in their own circles, and Carlito was just a common care thief.  Why would they cut him in as an equal partner in a tens of million dollar drug business?  Also, how did all three get in one cell.  This takes place in a time when racial tensions are high, and prison officials would not have put a white/African American and Hispanic in the same cell.  And while everyone else in the film hates each other for being differant, these three love each other.  I would have liked to see the story of how they got that way.

It was so bad, I HAD to warn the rest of you.The ONLY thing connecting this movie to the first one is Carlito, Drugs, New York and the 70's. There is nothing else since this movie doesn't seem to be connected in any other way to the original. I don't even see how they can get away with calling it a ""prequel"".First off, Jay Hernandez doesn't even remotely translate well into the role of Carlito Brigante that Al Pacino populated in the original. You get the idea that he is more likely, playing dress up and pretending to be someone he's not. Which technically is the truth. But come on, who wants to watch a movie and be reminded so often that everyone is just ""acting""? We want to feel like everything that's happening is real, and it's right on our own little TV screen.Secondly, none of the characters from the original show up in this movie. No Lalin, Pachanga (even though Luis Guzman plays a character named Nacho), no Reynaldo, which is who Carlito was connected with before his jailing. Not even Davy Kleinfeld. AndGail...poor thang is replaced by some Puerto-Rican girl named Leticia.So all these bizarre 1995 ""Shaft"" like events happen that leads up to the ending. Carlito is through with the drug business and ends up living in Barbados. Well, how did he come to the wonderful conclusion that he should get BACK into drugs, dump Leticia, move back to the NY and reunite with all the characters that we know and love from the original....plus end up at the place he started at IN THE BEGINNING of the original??????????Unanswered questions.This movie is more like a De-quel than a Pre-quel.

927763,A3B6D3A01L2AAD,B000ALM4G2,"Sal Magnum ""refugee from Babylon""","[5, 6]","Yeah, it's that good. Seems as though my original review has been lost by the Amazon censors, bless their hearts. After a long spell of anguish over my lost masterwork, I finally set forth on the dubious task of recreating it from scratch. What follows is a pale imitation of the original, but sufficient, nonetheless.WEAK POOP:It's the same old story from corporate Hollywood; someone ""in the business"" becomes enchanted with a by-gone classic and feverishly sets forth on an exploitative plan to redo, sequel or prequel it. Cash in on a sure-fire buck, basically. In that monetary gain is the name of the game, art takes a back seat. The typical style trumping substance.This film could be the poster child for such uninspired filth. A shallow, predictable plot, weak dialogue and horrendous acting on virtually all fronts. Hire actors based on looks and pop culture credentials and proceed to spoon-feed the guillible youth of this land the degradation they so desperately crave.The original ""Carlito's Way"" was a gangster classic. Perhaps my favorite of the genre. The characters portrayed deep, honest depictions of the grim life left for the common urbanite in the wake of the ""Dream,"" and one couldn't help but connect and empathize with them.Unfortunately, this wretched ""prequel"" is best served as a case study in ""Poor, Pompous Acting 101.""Sure, Jay Hernandez is physically more convincing than Al Pacino as a Po' Rican. But he appears to the observant eye as timid and awkward in the role Pacino so deftly defined in the original. It's as ridiculous as watching an Ivy Leaguer frontin' as a street thug. I was totally unconvinced and winced throughout his on-screen appearances for the retro-active shame his paltry performance will one day give him and his offspring. This was his chance at stardom and he blew it like a fart in the wind. Not to mention that he isn't even a native New Yawkah. I mean, with the 4.5 million Puerto Ricans living in the general vacinity, you'd think they could've found one who would've juiced up the role a lil' more effectively.Poof Diddly takes the cake though. I just knew this movie was cursed when I saw previews featuring this stained taint. My oh my. Poof cranks up the level of idiotic preening and posturing already running rampant. His role as a no-nonsense king-pin named Hollywood Nicky was surely a wet dream come true for ol' Diddy, and it shows. His desperate life-long struggle for street-cred probably seemed resolved...until we are blessed to see him work his schtick. ""Embarrassing,"" can't adequately describe it. It's the equivalent of an old syphilitic whoore trying to convince you that she's a fresh, young virgin. Much guffawing ensues, followed perhaps by a firm kick in the coccyx. Poof, you're foolin' nobody, you big girl :) (O, for bonus measure, you can watch the ""brilliant"" making-of documentary included in the dvd special features and discover how it was Poof's stroke of genius that had him daintily sipping from a tea-cup in the back of his whip like Miss Daisy, when his character is first seen onscreen. Cold gangsta!)The character of Earl's brother, Reggie, is another low point for cinematic art. Overtly boorish to the enth degree, this poor schmuck is portrayed with none of the subtleties which typify the great weasels in film history. You eagerly wait for the time when he is thrown in a dumpster, but alas, the melodramatics drag on and on before he is mercifully put out of his misery by his own brother in a contrived, ""Yeah, I never would've seen that coming,"" kind of plot ""twist.""It's also a backhand to all the great revolutionaries of the time period, how this blighted scourge carries on a cause he obviously is severely uninformed about. The filmmakers' spare no chance to heap insult and derisive dialogue on this character and his ""cause"". It becomes shamelessly evident that they mean to willfully denegrate the great counter-culture movements of the 60's and 70's. Only a cast of ignorant uncle toms would've set idly by watching, as rich ol' whitey shet down the throat of their cultural ethos. This character was a farce and in no way indicative of the Black Panthers which we are to assume he is supposedly representing. Fred Hampton would've stomped a mudhole in this cur's arse for being such a whiny, self-centered numbnut. I'm guessing whomever dreamt this character (or the whole storyline for that matter) up was a whitebred lush born with silver spoon in ahss who likely caught flack from the revolutionary types during childhood. Or maybe they had been countlessly raped for their lunch money every day on the way to school in an area where old winos and junkies were the only ones in the vacinity to hear their mournful cries, where no Sir Gallahad would ever come racing to their rescue to stop the brutal inhumanity. Left forever to carry the proverbial ""cross-to-bear"" and curse the poor for their fate. Such is life.Also in this movie, there are several vain attempts at humor scattered throughout, all going over like a lead balloon in a psyche ward. You are likely to hear yourself chortling a few notes like Dick Cheney suffering a light stroke, but this is more in the vein of laughing ""at them,"" instead of ""with them.""The dialogue (or lack thereof) of this trite flick is also of note. It's the type of mundane mediocrity that would leave a Cro-Magnon feeling intellectually slighted, hungering for meat to cover these conversational bones. Gaping holes in the script are nonchalantly scattered throughout like we aren't supposed to notice. Keep us on our toes wondering, 'Wtf did I miss?!' None of the scenes are very well set up, and as a result, all the resolutions to them seem botched and anti-climactic.Yes, this film is full of holes, but the most unforgivable error, at least in my mind, is the way it ends. Touted as a ""prequel,"" the decision was obviously made to have this film stand on its' own wobbly legs. In the end, cheesy, feel-good fluff is smeared all on ya face like a sick joke. Where in the original do we hear of Carlito running off to the tropics? It was most assuredly his dream, but one that was never realized. A man gone to his version of utopia with the self-proclaimed love of his life and oodles of dough would have no need to come back and grovel in the cold, unforgiving streets again. Especially a man with the rare sense Carlito (Pacino's version) had. Not to mention that he is supposed to have just served a stretch in the big house prior to the original, as opposed to a glorious island vacation. Way to retch on my face you buggers!Bottom line; forget they ever made this filth and stick with the original. Steer clear of this abomination lest it soil your opinion of the real ""Carlito's Way,"" which is a true masterpiece.",1,Weak Poop,1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,6786,"['Yeah', 'good', 'original',
