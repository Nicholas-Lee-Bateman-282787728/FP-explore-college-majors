356133,A3QF3O0ZENYTAU,6303101410,"Amazon Customer ""Addiction Specialist""","[2, 2]","My Name is Bill W. is in our film library at our Retreat. It is required watching for our guests as they begin to learn about the disease of alcoholism, and to learn about the solution to the disease. Like personal favorite family stories, or beloved stories from Scripture, the Bill W. story never seems to become stale. Although the co-founders of AA worked very hard to stay humble and anonymous, inevitably  for people who have recovered from a seemingly hopeless state of mind and body, the story of AA's birth and early days has an iconic reverence to it. We love to tell it, read it and watch it again and again.I have the pleasure of hearing the Bill W. movie reviewed very regularly by our guests, and it is always well-received and enthusiastically discussed. As our guests struggle with the damage of alcoholism in themselves, watching James Wood and James Garner portray with empathy and compassion the co-founders, they begin to accept themselves a little bit more. My favorite scene in the film is when Bill W. is coming off a bender, and he standing by his living room window, staring out at it. His wife, and co-founder of Alanon, Lois asks Bill, ""Why do you do it?"". Bill looks at her with such dismay and resignation and answers truthfully, ""I don't know"". The point just drives home, that there was no recovery program for Bill W. or Dr Bob to phone up and ask for the nearest meeting. They were doomed to an alcoholic death - until their divine intervention.A great film, well acted, sensitive, and true to the story of the Bill Wilson as I understand it.Jane Derry",5,"Consistantly watched, and consistantly appreciated.",1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,1585,"['Name', 'Bill', 'W.', 'film', 'library', 'Retreat', 'required', 'watching', 'guests', 'begin', 'learn', 'disease', 'alcoholism', 'learn', 'solution', 'disease', 'personal', 'favorite', 'family', 'stories', 'beloved', 'stories', 'Scripture', 'Bill', 'W.', 'story', 'never', 'become', 'stale', 'co-founders', 'AA', 'worked', 'very', 'hard', 'stay', 'humble', 'anonymous', 'inevitably', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'recovered', 'seemingly', 'hopeless', 'state', 'mind', 'body', 'story', 'AA', 'birth', 'early', 'days', 'iconic', 'reverence', 'love', 'tell', 'read', 'watch', 'again', 'again.I', 'have', 'pleasure', 'hearing', 'Bill', 'W.', 'movie', 'reviewed', 'very', 'regularly', 'guests', 'always', 'well-received', 'enthusiastically', 'discussed', 'guests', 'struggle', 'damage', 'alcoholism', 'watching', 'James', 'Wood', 'James', 'Garner', 'portray', 'empathy', 'compassion', 'co-founders', 'begin', 'accept', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'favorite', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Bill', 'W.', 'coming', 'off', 'bender', 'standing', 'living', 'room', 'window', 'staring', 'out', 'wife', 'co-founder', 'Alanon', 'Lois', 'Bill', 'Why', 'do', 'do', 'Bill', 'such', 'dismay', 'resignation', 'answers', 'truthfully', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'point', 'just', 'home', 'was', 'recovery', 'program', 'Bill', 'W.', 'Dr', 'Bob', 'phone', 'up', 'ask', 'nearest', 'meeting', 'were', 'doomed', 'alcoholic', 'death', 'divine', 'intervention.A', 'great', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'sensitive', 'true', 'story', 'Bill', 'Wilson', 'understand', 'it.Jane', 'Derry']",My Name Is Bill W.

This movie, regrettably is available only on VHS, will give you insight, understanding, and hope. Hope, that most fragile of words, is the basis of this incredible made-for-TV motion picture.Bill Wilson comes home from World War I a hero. He then conquers Wall Street. He marries the love of his life, Lois. He then discovers both a new god, a new lover, a new idol; the bottle. This unflinching film looks at the descent of of alcoholic into hell, and his journey back, guided, not by the spirit of Virgil, but by another alcoholic, Doctor Bob. Together, they find a &quot;cure&quot; for an &quot;incurable&quot; disease.

Once thought of as isolated from the realm of religion -- scholars of religious movements now regard the founding of AA with its reliance on a ""Higher Power"" as a major milestone in the evolution of American spiritual movements. This is especially true in newer books like Phyllis Tickle's ""Great Emergence, The: How Christianity Is Changing and Why (emersion: Emergent Village resources for communities of faith)"" Tickle argues that ""AA opened the floodgates to spirituality by removing the confines of organized religion.""Think about its influence for a moment. Here is a massive national network formed around essentially spiritual principles that cut across religious boundaries -- and even manages to include non-religious people who define ""Higher Power"" in other ways.

356153,A1O820Q2OBFFQH,6303101410,Hamish Adam,"[4, 4]","In reality all `Eureka' moments, like the subject of this film, the discovery of a means to arrest the disease of alcoholism, come slowly and painfully.  And although this movie opens with Dr Bob's brilliantly photographed deathbed scene, most of the film drags us along on the long slow trudge through the disease in action.Anyone who has been there will identify.  It's depiction of the unending and utter hopelessness will be a painful, and salutary, reminder to everyone in recovery.While every single performance in it is absolutely, and surprisingly, top notch given the constraints on made-for-television movies, James Woods and Jo Beth Williams, for me, stood out in particular.  James Wood's and Jo Beth's window scene always reduces every recovering person who I've ever watched the film with, to tears.There are so many standout scenes that it's hard to pick a few.  But for me, the first meeting of Dr Bob and Bill Wilson, the movie's `Eureka' moment, was fabulously moving.  ""Why are you helping me?"" asks Dr Bob whom Bill Wilson has been invited to try to assist.  ""I'm not here to help you"", says James Woods, ""I'm here to help me"".  And with that apparent paradox, he has Dr Bob's attention.The next great scene is in the meeting at the end of the film where Bill Wilson turns to a newcomer to help him.  The camera cranes out and back revealing the two of them alone in the now emptied meeting room.  It is the summation of everything that Alcoholics Anonymous stands for - humility and helping others.  And, like Dr Bob's deathbed scene, it is a beautifully executed piece of cinematography.The story of the years leading up to the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous is so complex, dreary and downright depressing that it was hard for me to imagine how this might be handled as a film.  However, the film seems to work so well because the script just tells it how it was, warts and all.And so when the breakthrough finally happens, its impact on the audience, like its impact on millions of suffering alcoholics, is total.

If not for him, this movie would have been a total FLOP).  In honesty, I laughed when Ebby staggered down the road.  Who really likes to see a drunk stagger, let alone someone doing a rather bad inpression of one while trying to be serious?

356175,A1ZYV05OSO4QZK,6303101410,"Zulu Warrior ""71RoadRunner""","[9, 42]","Marital difficultiesWilson was serially unfaithful to his wife Lois. Wilson 's affairs with women caused controversy and concern within AA and it was common knowledge in New York AA circles. His interest in younger women increased with his age, and caused Barry Leach and other friends of Wilson to form a ""Founders Watch"". People were assigned to keep an eye on Wilson during the socializing that followed AA functions and to separate and steer away those young women who caught Wilson's interest. Wilson, like many in his generation, could be sexist, but he was also ""capable of treating the women who worked with him with dignity and respect"". In the mid 1950s he began an affair with Helen Wyn, a woman 22 years his junior, ""in duration, intensity and scope"" this was different from his other affairs. Wilson at one point discussed divorcing Lois to marry Helen. Wilson with determined perseverance was able to overcome the AA trustees objections, and renegotiated his royalty agreements with them in 1963, which allowed him to include Helen Wynn in his estate. He left 10% of his book royalties to Helen and the other 90% to his wife Lois. In 1968 with Wilson's illness making it harder for them to spend time together, Helen bought a house in Ireland.Alternative cures and spiritualismIn the 1950s Wilson experimented with LSD in medically supervised experiments with Gerard Heard and Aldous Huxley. With Wilson's invitation his wife Lois, Father Dowling, and Nell Wing also participated in experimentation of this drug. Later Wilson wrote to Carl Jung, praising the results and recommending it as validation of Jung's spiritual experience. (The letter was not in fact sent as Jung had died.)At a parapsychology meeting in the 1960s, Wilson met Abram Hoffer and learned about the potential mood-stabilizing effects of niacin. Wilson was impressed with experiments indicating that alcoholics who were given niacin had a better sobriety rate, and he began to see niacin ""as completing the third leg in the stool, the physical to complement the spiritual and emotional."" Wilson also believed that niacin had given him relief from depression, and he promoted the vitamin within the AA community and with the National Institute of Mental Health as a treatment for schizophrenia. However, Wilson created a major furor in AA because he used the AA office and letterhead in his promotion.For Wilson, spiritualism (communicating with the spirits of the dead) was a life-long interest. One of his letters to his spiritual adviser Father Ed Dowling suggests that while Wilson was working on his book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions he felt that spirits were helping him, in particular a 15th century monk named Boniface.[18] Wilson believed that the living could communicate with the dead and kept a ""Spook Room"" in his basement, where he along and others would conduct seances with a Ouijiboard, as well as experiment with automatic writing. Despite his conviction that he had evidence for the reality of the spiritual world, Wilson chose not to share this with AA.",1,LSD Guru,1172016000,"02 21, 2007",2007,3064,"['Marital', 'difficultiesWilson', 'was', 'serially', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'Lois', 'Wilson', 'affairs', 'women', 'caused', 'controversy', 'concern', 'AA', 'was', 'common', 'knowledge', 'New', 'York', 'AA', 'circles', 'interest', 'younger', 'women', 'increased', 'age', 'caused', 'Barry', 'Leach', 'other', 'friends', 'Wilson', 'form', 'Founders', 'Watch', 'People', 'were', 'assigned', 'keep', 'eye', 'Wilson', 'socializing', 'followed', 'AA', 'functions', 'separate', 'steer', 'away', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'caught', 'Wilson', 'interest', 'Wilson', 'many', 'generation', 'could', 'be', 'sexist', 'was', 'also', 'capable', 'treating', 'women', 'who', 'worked', 'dignity', 'respect', 'mid', '1950s', 'began', 'affair', 'Helen', 'Wyn', 'woman', '22', 'years', 'junior', 'duration', 'intensity', 'scope', 'was', 'different', 'other', 'affairs', 'Wilson', 'one', 'point', 'discussed', 'divorcing', 'Lois', 'marry', 'Helen', 'Wilson', 'determined', 'perseverance', 'was', 'able', 'overcome', 'AA', 'trustees', 'objections', 'renegotiated', 'royalty', 'agreements', '1963', 'allowed', 'include', 'Helen', 'Wynn', 'estate', 'left', '10', '%', 'book', 'royalties', 'Helen', 'other', '90', '%', 'wife', 'Lois', '1968', 'Wilson', 'illness', 'making', 'harder', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'Helen', 'bought', 'house', 'Ireland.Alternative', 'cures', 'spiritualismIn', '1950s', 'Wilson', 'experimented', 'LSD', 'medically', 'supervised', 'experiments', 'Gerard', 'Heard', 'Aldous', 'Huxley', 'Wilson', 'invitation', 'wife', 'Lois', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Nell', 'Wing', 'also', 'participated', 'experimentation', 'drug', 'Later', 'Wilson', 'wrote', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'praising', 'results', 'recommending', 'validation', 'Jung', 'spiritual', 'experience', 'letter', 'was', 'not', 'fact', 'sent', 'Jung', 'had', 'died', 'parapsychology', 'meeting', '1960s', 'Wilson', 'met', 'Abram', 'Hoffer', 'learned', 'potential', 'mood-stabilizing', 'effects', 'niacin', 'Wilson', 'was', 'impressed', 'experiments', 'indicating', 'alcoholics', 'who', 'were', 'given', 'niacin', 'had', 'better', 'sobriety', 'rate', 'began', 'see', 'niacin', 'completing', 'third', 'leg', 'stool', 'physical', 'complement', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'Wilson', 'also', 'believed', 'niacin', 'had', 'given', 'relief', 'depression', 'promoted', 'vitamin', 'AA', 'community', 'National', 'Institute', 'Mental', 'Health', 'treatment', 'schizophrenia', 'However', 'Wilson', 'created', 'major', 'furor', 'AA', 'used', 'AA', 'office', 'letterhead', 'promotion.For', 'Wilson', 'spiritualism', 'communicating', 'spirits', 'dead', 'was', 'life-long', 'interest', 'One', 'letters', 'spiritual', 'adviser', 'Father', 'Ed', 'Dowling', 'Wilson', 'was', 'working', 'book', 'Twelve', 'Steps', 'Twelve', 'Traditions', 'felt', 'spirits', 'were', 'helping', 'particular', '15th', 'century', 'monk', 'named', 'Boniface', '18', ']', 'Wilson', 'believed', 'living', 'could', 'communicate', 'dead', 'kept', 'Spook', 'Room', 'basement', 'where', 'along', 'others', 'would', 'conduct', 'seances', 'Ouijiboard', 'as', 'well', 'experiment', 'automatic', 'writing', 'conviction', 'had', 'evidence', 'reality', 'spiritual', 'world', 'Wilson', 'chose', 'not', 'share', 'AA']",My Name Is Bill W.
