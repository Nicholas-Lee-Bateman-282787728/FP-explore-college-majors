Johnson,"[1, 1]","Appropriately titled, ""Get Down"", because that is literally what the main character's assailants want him to do and what he is desperately trying his best not to do, once he lands up in a tree after defending himself in a botched robbery.  While they're waiting each other out, there are moments when each character's own inner turmoils comes to light.  I thought it was quite a different approach and a very interesting concept for a movie.",5,Great Movie!,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,441,"['Appropriately', 'titled', 'Get', 'Down', 'literally', 'what', 'main', 'character', 'assailants', 'want', 'do', 'what', 'desperately', 'trying', 'best', 'not', 'do', 'once', 'up', 'tree', 'defending', 'botched', 'robbery', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'other', 'out', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'character', 'own', 'inner', 'turmoils', 'light', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'different', 'approach', 'very', 'interesting', 'concept', 'movie']",Get Down

WHEN HE PREVENTS ONE OF THE GANG MEMBERS FROM ROBBING HIM, THE WHOLE GANG TRYS TO GET VENGEANCE ON HIM. TRAPPED IN THE WOODS, HE MUST FIGHT TO ESCAPE THE GANG. THE REAL SUPRISING THING IS THAT MUCH OF THE GANG IS ACTUALLY WHITE. THERE'S ONLY TWO BLACK MEMBERS. ANYWAY, THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT MOVES AT A CONSIDERABLY SLOW PACE. THOUGH THE COVER FOR THIS MOVIE LOOKS LIKE A GANGSTA MOVIE, IT'S FAR FROM BEING ONE. IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING FOR A GANGSTA MOVIE THAT HAS A LOT OF SHOOTING AND KILLING, THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A MOVIE YOU WANNA RENT.

I have seen a few of his movies and love him in Stargate Atlantis, so I decided to see some of his other movies. As always, I am impressed by David's wonderful acting. Combined with the plot of the movie, this was a wonderfully enjoyable movie.Get Down (or Treed Murray) is a movie that really brings into the light what people will do for themselves, but also what they will do for others. It's the best and it's the worst. This movie was gripping and I really had no idea what would happen at the end. I do not regret buying this movie. Even if I had only rented, I would have bought it anyway. For David Hewlett fans I highly recommend this movie. For anyone who is just interested in the odd title (either one) I say the same. This movie caught me by surprise. I assure you that it will do the same for any future viewers.",5,"As Always, Impressed",1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,888,"['Originally', 'only', 'bought', 'movie', 'David', 'Hewlett', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'movies', 'love', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'decided', 'see', 'other', 'movies', 'always', 'am', 'impressed', 'David', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'Combined', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'enjoyable', 'movie.Get', 'Down', 'Treed', 'Murray', 'movie', 'really', 'light', 'what', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'also', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'others', 'best', 'worst', 'movie', 'was', 'gripping', 'really', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'end', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'buying', 'movie', 'Even', 'had', 'only', 'rented', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'anyway', 'David', 'Hewlett', 'fans', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'interested', 'odd', 'title', 'one', 'say', 'same', 'movie', 'caught', 'surprise', 'assure', 'will', 'do', 'same', 'future', 'viewers']",Get Down
