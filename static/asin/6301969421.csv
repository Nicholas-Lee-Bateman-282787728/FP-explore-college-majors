281021,A1DD15RXIXWENM,6301969421,"Anton Beat Riess ""Toni Riess""","[2, 3]","It was a dream of Gene Kelly to make a movie, without any spoken words - only with music and dance. MGM wasn't really interested - they would do it only when Gene Kelly appears in each of the four episodes. One episodes was deleted, so there are now 3 episodes: ""Circus"", ""Ring Around the Rosy"", and ""Sinbad the Sailor"".Each part has another dance style: Ballet, tapdance, swing, jazz, waltz etc.The most enjoyable episode is ""Sinbad the Sailor"" where Gene Kelly and David Kasday dancing in a animated world with animated characters together. This was really made perfect!!! The same was done 10 years later for Disney's ""Mary Poppins"".It wasn't a big success but today the movies is a piece of movie history and art! Gene Kelly is and was a genious in dance and choreography!!!!About the DVD:its not restored or remastered. Of course, it doesn't need any subtitles (there are no any spoken words!!!).The Picture quality is good but by far not perfect. Its not really sharp and clean but ok.The Sound is original in MONO but a little bit too quiet.Fazit: when you like Gene Kelly or MGM Musical, Ballet, Tapdance - then you must have this DVD.",4,Musical experiment,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,1143,"['was', 'dream', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'make', 'movie', 'spoken', 'words', 'only', 'music', 'dance', 'MGM', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'interested', 'would', 'do', 'only', 'when', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'four', 'episodes', 'One', 'episodes', 'was', 'deleted', 'are', 'now', '3', 'episodes', 'Circus', 'Ring', 'Rosy', 'Sinbad', 'Sailor', '.Each', 'part', 'dance', 'style', 'Ballet', 'tapdance', 'swing', 'jazz', 'waltz', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'episode', 'Sinbad', 'Sailor', 'where', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'David', 'Kasday', 'dancing', 'animated', 'world', 'animated', 'characters', 'together', 'was', 'really', 'made', 'perfect', 'same', 'was', 'done', '10', 'years', 'later', 'Disney', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'success', 'today', 'movies', 'piece', 'movie', 'history', 'art', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'was', 'genious', 'dance', 'choreography', 'DVD', 'not', 'restored', 'remastered', 'course', ""n't"", 'need', 'subtitles', 'are', 'spoken', 'words', 'Picture', 'quality', 'good', 'far', 'not', 'perfect', 'not', 'really', 'sharp', 'clean', 'ok.The', 'Sound', 'original', 'MONO', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'quiet.Fazit', 'when', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'MGM', 'Musical', 'Ballet', 'Tapdance', 'then', 'must', 'have', 'DVD']",N/A

281025,AB9Q52OYE7E6N,6301969421,"G. Schneider ""old movie buff""","[2, 2]","This film, as most people know, is in three segments, each with a different style and cast of characters...except for Gene Kelly, who stars in all three...apparently at the behest of Louis B. Mayer, who wouldn't green-light the project unless he did star in all three.The first two segments aren't, to me, anything near as entertaining as the third one. The kid who plays the genie of the lamp, who transforms into a little sailor, is brilliant and adorable. His dancing with Kelly is wonderful. Wikipedia has no information on him other than his name, David Kasday. Did he grow up to be an adult dancer?Some credit should be given to the two dancers who portray the evil guardsmen...unless Kelly danced for both of them and the animation artists used his footage for their drawings...which brings us to a major complaint: Where are the bonus features for this film? The DVD is one of those made-to-order things, which means they didn't figure it would sell, so why make thousands of copies, only to have them sit in a warehouse. (That's what I do with my albums!) After all, the film was pretty much a flop in its day. In fact, it was made in 1952 but held back by MGM until 1956 because they didn't have any faith in its commercial viability...and they were right! Anyway, with this made-to-order deal, they manufacture them on demand, but without any frills and no great expense in promoting it.

281026,AI4E5IFOT4QER,6301969421,James M. Shertzer,"[4, 5]","Based on the success of ""An American in Paris,"" and partly to placate one of its leading stars, MGM allowed Gene Kelly to do an all-ballet film in 1952. He was forced to make the film in England (for the tax credits) and MGM insisted Kelly be in each of the sequences, even though he originally had planned to showcase only other dance greats. The studio brass scrapped one sequence entirely and re-edited and tossed the score of another, substituting a new jazz score by young Andre Previn. Then, unhappy with the final result, they put the film on the shelf, where it sat for years before it was given a short release in a few art theaters. Kelly's dreams were dashed and his MGM star soon dimmed. The film was largely forgotten but remembered fondly by film buffs. The opening circus sequence, to a commissioned score by Jacques Ibert, is the weakest - more pantomime than dance. But there is much to enjoy in the second two - including Kelly's steamy duet with Tamara Toumanova, once one of the Diaghilev's ""baby ballerinas"" - and the lively character dancing in the semi-animated ""Scherazade"" (featuring a very young Carol Haney) and Hanna-Barbera cartooning. It's a one of a kind film and it's sad, given its limited appeal, it's likely never to be properly restored. A few clips in remastered Blu-Ray appear on BR disc of ""American in Paris"" giving a glimpse of what might have been.",4,One of a kind ...,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,1390,"['Based', 'success', 'American', 'Paris', 'partly', 'placate', 'one', 'leading', 'stars', 'MGM', 'allowed', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'do', 'all-ballet', 'film', '1952', 'was', 'forced', 'make', 'film', 'England', 'tax', 'credits', 'MGM', 'insisted', 'Kelly', 'be', 'sequences', 'even', 'originally', 'had', 'planned', 'showcase', 'only', 'other', 'dance', 'greats', 'studio', 'brass', 'scrapped', 'one', 'sequence', 'entirely', 're-edited', 'tossed', 'score', 'substituting', 'new', 'jazz', 'score', 'young', 'Andre', 'Previn', 'Then', 'unhappy', 'final', 'result', 'put', 'film', 'shelf', 'where', 'sat', 'years', 'was', 'given', 'short', 'release', 'few', 'art', 'theaters', 'Kelly', 'dreams', 'were', 'dashed', 'MGM', 'star', 'soon', 'dimmed', 'film', 'was', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'remembered', 'fondly', 'film', 'buffs', 'opening', 'circus', 'sequence', 'commissioned', 'score', 'Jacques', 'Ibert', 'weakest', 'more', 'pantomime', 'dance', 'much', 'enjoy', 'second', 'two', 'including', 'Kelly', 'steamy', 'duet', 'Tamara', 'Toumanova', 'once', 'one', 'Diaghilev', 'baby', 'ballerinas', 'lively', 'character', 'dancing', 'semi-animated', 'Scherazade', 'featuring', 'very', 'young', 'Carol', 'Haney', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'cartooning', 'one', 'kind', 'film', 'sad', 'given', 'limited', 'appeal', 'likely', 'never', 'be', 'properly', 'restored', 'few', 'clips', 'remastered', 'Blu-Ray', 'appear', 'BR', 'disc', 'American', 'Paris', 'giving', 'glimpse', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been']",N/A

281030,A1P89WQP4WLH97,6301969421,Roseann S.,"[1, 1]","This is not your run of the mill dance movie.  In fact I would say it would mainly appeal to Gene Kelly fans more than fans of movie musicals in general.There is no dialogue at all in the film.  It is made up of three segments, three separate stories each prominently featuring Gene in one of the roles.The best by far and my favorite is the third segment where he interacts and dances with animation as the sailor in ancient Bagdad seeking the sweet maiden's favor.  I think it was very far ahead of its time in terms of the technological making of the film and the very concept.  The DVD is worth the price just for this segment.I also liked the first segment where Gene is the mime clown in love with the beautiful ballerina who loves the tight rope walker.  It's a typical story of the outcast who dreams himself beautiful and loved but Gene plays it with a lot of tenderness and since I have never seen Gene do mime like this I found it fascinating.The second segment is my least favorite.  It is about a ring that goes round through several people before coming back to the original owner.  Gene's section shows him as a serviceman on leave who gives the ring to a woman who I interpreted to be a street prostitute.  All of this is done through dance and it is nicely danced but not a story that appealed to me.I found it enjoyable but I am rating it four stars because I don't really think it is everybody's dish of tea.",4,Three sides of Gene Kelly,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,1427,"['not', 'run', 'mill', 'dance', 'movie', 'fact', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'mainly', 'appeal', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'more', 'fans', 'movie', 'musicals', 'general.There', 'dialogue', 'film', 'made', 'three', 'segments', 'three', 'separate', 'stories', 'prominently', 'featuring', 'Gene', 'one', 'roles.The', 'best', 'far', 'favorite', 'third', 'segment', 'where', 'dances', 'animation', 'sailor', 'ancient', 'Bagdad', 'seeking', 'sweet', 'maiden', 'favor', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'terms', 'technological', 'making', 'film', 'very', 'concept', 'DVD', 'price', 'just', 'segment.I', 'also', 'liked', 'first', 'segment', 'where', 'Gene', 'mime', 'clown', 'love', 'beautiful', 'ballerina', 'who', 'tight', 'rope', 'walker', 'typical', 'story', 'outcast', 'who', 'beautiful', 'loved', 'Gene', 'lot', 'tenderness', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Gene', 'do', 'mime', 'found', 'fascinating.The', 'second', 'segment', 'least', 'favorite', 'ring', 'round', 'several', 'people', 'coming', 'back', 'original', 'owner', 'Gene', 'section', 'serviceman', 'leave', 'who', 'ring', 'woman', 'who', 'interpreted', 'be', 'street', 'prostitute', 'done', 'dance', 'nicely', 'danced', 'not', 'story', 'appealed', 'me.I', 'enjoyable', 'am', 'rating', 'four', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'everybody', 'dish', 'tea']",N/A
