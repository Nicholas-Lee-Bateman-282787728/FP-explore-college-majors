1045320,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B000MEYK96,blackaciddevil,"[1, 2]","Directed by Drew Bell, this remake to Tod Browning's Freaks titled Freakshow tells the story about a gang of thieves, working as security guards in a traveling carnival, who plot to steal their rich owner's fortune. One of the thieves attempts to take the fortune herself by seducing the Boss and marrying him. The youngest member of the Freakshow stumbles across some of the gang members stealing food and she is murdered by them.  When the murder is discovered, the freaks plot revenge. Thus begins the tale of Freakshow.....I'll admit, for a low-budget remake, it wasn't too bad. Suprisingly, it did hold my interest til the very end..when I really didn't think it would as it got off to a rough start for me. I think the main faults I saw with this movie were the sex and the over-the-top gore. If it were scaled back, somewhat, I feel it would've made the movie just right. I totally agree with another reviewer here that if certain things were only implied and we were shown the result afterwards-it would have made the movie alot stronger. However, the way it is--it was okay, nothing special.Don't let these other reviews sway you, though, the movie isn't a complete waste of time like they'd like you to believe. It is, I'm sorry to admit, a strange movie so to speak. True, the performances may lack here and there but it is a decent remake to Tod Browning's Freaks. I do prefer the original but I recommend the remake as well.",3,Freakshow......,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,1437,"['Directed', 'Drew', 'Bell', 'remake', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'Freaks', 'titled', 'Freakshow', 'story', 'gang', 'thieves', 'working', 'security', 'guards', 'traveling', 'carnival', 'who', 'plot', 'steal', 'rich', 'owner', 'fortune', 'One', 'thieves', 'attempts', 'take', 'fortune', 'seducing', 'Boss', 'marrying', 'youngest', 'member', 'Freakshow', 'gang', 'members', 'stealing', 'food', 'murdered', 'When', 'murder', 'discovered', 'freaks', 'plot', 'revenge', 'Thus', 'tale', 'Freakshow', '..I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'low-budget', 'remake', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'Suprisingly', 'did', 'hold', 'interest', 'very', 'end..when', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'got', 'off', 'rough', 'start', 'think', 'main', 'faults', 'saw', 'movie', 'were', 'sex', 'over-the-top', 'gore', 'were', 'scaled', 'back', 'somewhat', 'feel', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'movie', 'just', 'right', 'totally', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'here', 'certain', 'things', 'were', 'only', 'implied', 'were', 'shown', 'result', 'afterwards-it', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'alot', 'stronger', 'However', 'way', 'was', 'okay', 'nothing', 'special.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'other', 'reviews', 'sway', 'though', 'movie', ""n't"", 'complete', 'waste', 'time', ""'d"", 'like', 'believe', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'admit', 'strange', 'movie', 'so', 'speak', 'True', 'performances', 'may', 'lack', 'here', 'there', 'decent', 'remake', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'Freaks', 'do', 'prefer', 'original', 'recommend', 'remake', 'as', 'well']",N/A

You've got these thieves trying to steal stuff from the circus owner who has a bunch of freaks, and you get a slow-paced film with too much unnecessary filler. Almost all of the violence and gore takes place towards the end of the film. Without providing any effective atmosphere, you just simply watch the film go from one dialogue scene to the next at the circus. It attempts to build character development and tell a plot that is simple and doesn't require the amount of filler which is in the film. There's some topless scenes in the film, and it has some violent and effective gore sequences. The ending torture scene is really gruesome, but the movie is sometimes dull and uninvolving. None of the soundtracks are worth mentioning, it lacks action overall, and the directing is mediocre. I wasn't buying this type of film to see a slow-moving and talky flick; I just wanted exploitation in a film like this. I really liked some of violence and gore; it certainly delivers in some parts. However, it suffers in replay value because of its unnecessary filler; it's simply dull at times. It says on the box it's banned in 43 countries, but I don't believe it.This DVD has a good amount of extras like a filmmaker's commentary, alternate ending and opening and some more.

But I was surprised by how well it held me, and the number of entertaining little touches in what is obviously a very, very low budget effort.There's not much in the way of ""real"" freaks here, although there are genuine human oddities scattered among the cast members. And this has to be the only movie I've ever seen about a traveling carnival that never showed a single crowd scene or, indeed, even a single customer coming to visit (looking at the rickety old ferris wheel they had, I doubt it was approved for people to ride on).But that being said, the photography and art direction were surprisingly good, the period soundtrack was suitably haunting, and the performances were entertaining (if not always professional). A standout was Christopher Adamson in the role of the ringmaster, dripping with squint-eyed malice as well as dripping from numerous boils and ulcers.The sex and violence aren't really too graphic until the final ""transformation"" scene, which is so over the top that it seems grafted on from another movie. I think the movie would actually be stronger if it simply implied what was about to happen to the ""victim""...and then showed us the results.I bumped this up to 4 stars to help counterbalance some of the other reviews, and also because I think that within the constraints of a very low budget, the filmmakers did a nice job.

Unfortunately you'll be HORRORifically unimpressed. Freakshow stumbles along on a tightrope-thin plot vaguely circling around a group of workers planning to make off with a load of money by sending an unbridled tramp to seduce a circus master with laughably fake boils on his face.Try as you might, there's hardly a coherent plot to be found anywhere in this tedious botch job of a horror movie. Dirty sex abounds throughout, but for the most part, it ends up disturbing more than tittilating.This film advertises itself as being ""banned in 43 countries"". That's a good gimmick really. Until you realize that it was probably banned for being a meaningless jumble of adolescent pseudo-horror thrown together in a jumble by a few producers trying to make a buck off of exploiting the idea that they are using ""REAL FREAKS"". There are no sideshow types in this film. There is a midget, a man with no legs, a man with no arms, a big bald guy, a latexed Elephant Man ripoff, an Amazonian porn star, a guy with hair glued to his face (dogman), and a half-man/half-woman... none of these are ""freaks"" per se.Overall this movie is tremendously disappointing, and I'd like to help prevent future viewers of this movie from coming anywhere near it because it really is the lowest form of filmmaking to be so pretentious as to use a gimmick like the phrase ""freak"" to sell a hodge-podge of bad acting, cheesy gore, and hastily thrown together murder scenes.The murders are not interesting, the sex scenes are awkward, the gore is fake looking, and the script will leave you wanting to stick hooks into your own skin.The DVD has several special features, which are just as painful to watch as the film itself. The only cool part of the entire DVD is watching the man with no arms drive with his feet in a behind the scenes featurette. And that's only a few seconds.Please don't buy this movie. Don't even rent it. You will regret it. No matter how much you think you might be interested in this, I can promise that you won't be. I love horror movies: bad horror, gory horror, even cheesy horror. This is just low budget horror mascarading as something worthwhile. I suggest you bypass this garbage and get something that pulls off the ""so offensive it's interesting"" genre, like Bloodsucking Freaks or pretty much any John Waters film.As a final note, I'd like to point out that Freakshow is a remake of the 1932 horror film Freaks, and while the original is exciting and surprisingly interesting even today, Freakshow is a terribly executed remake vaguely following the original plot but tossing in needless sex and violence, and confusing the story to the point of being nonsensical.",1,Worst.
