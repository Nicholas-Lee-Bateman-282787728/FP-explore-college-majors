716464,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00006I03X,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 5]","Dawn Rider (1935) is one of my favorite early John Wayne westerns.  While it does fit the mold of all the Lone Star Productions vehicles featuring The Duke amidst a cast of regulars such as Yakima Canutt, it rises a cut above the rest through its rather involved plot, a less than completely happy ending, and some great scenes such as the final showdown in which The Duke saunters down the street in impressive ""this town ain't big enough for the both of us"" fashion.  Wayne plays John Mason, who arrives home just in time to see his father murdered during a robbery - but not before he gets acquainted with local tough guy Ben (Reed Howes).  Both men go at it pretty good only to become best of friends by the time the fight is over.  When his dad is killed, Mason goes after the gang of thugs, taking out a few of them but sustaining two gunshot wounds of his own.  Ben's sweetie nurses him back to health, but as luck would have it, her own brother is the man Mason is looking for.  As if this isn't complicated enough, Ben starts to believe that Mason is after his girl, placing an unsuspecting Mason up to his neck in trouble later on.  Most of these early westerns have a happy ending all the way around, but Dawn Rider does not, and this fact really makes this film stand out in my mind.  Packed with action, great performances, and some magnificently staged gunfights, Dawn Rider is a movie every fan of old westerns can enjoy - especially if you also happen to be a big John Wayne fan.",5,A cut above most early John Wayne westerns,1051747200,"05 1, 2003",2003,1495,"['Dawn', 'Rider', '1935', 'one', 'favorite', 'early', 'John', 'Wayne', 'westerns', 'fit', 'mold', 'Lone', 'Star', 'Productions', 'vehicles', 'featuring', 'Duke', 'cast', 'regulars', 'such', 'Yakima', 'Canutt', 'cut', 'rest', 'rather', 'involved', 'plot', 'less', 'completely', 'happy', 'ending', 'great', 'scenes', 'such', 'final', 'showdown', 'Duke', 'saunters', 'down', 'street', 'impressive', 'town', 'ai', ""n't"", 'big', 'enough', 'fashion', 'Wayne', 'John', 'Mason', 'who', 'home', 'just', 'time', 'see', 'father', 'murdered', 'robbery', 'not', 'acquainted', 'local', 'tough', 'guy', 'Ben', 'Reed', 'Howes', 'men', 'go', 'pretty', 'good', 'only', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'time', 'fight', 'over', 'When', 'dad', 'killed', 'Mason', 'gang', 'thugs', 'taking', 'out', 'few', 'sustaining', 'two', 'gunshot', 'wounds', 'own', 'Ben', 'sweetie', 'back', 'health', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'own', 'brother', 'man', 'Mason', 'looking', ""n't"", 'complicated', 'enough', 'Ben', 'believe', 'Mason', 'girl', 'placing', 'unsuspecting', 'Mason', 'up', 'neck', 'trouble', 'later', 'Most', 'early', 'westerns', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'way', 'Dawn', 'Rider', 'not', 'fact', 'really', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'mind', 'Packed', 'action', 'great', 'performances', 'magnificently', 'staged', 'gunfights', 'Dawn', 'Rider', 'movie', 'fan', 'old', 'westerns', 'can', 'enjoy', 'especially', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'big', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fan']",N/A

716466,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B00006I03X,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 2]","Between 1926 and 1935, when this film was made, John Wayne appeared in more than 50 films. His silent films were mostly with Fox and he worked on many films with John Ford directing (e.g., ""Four Sons"" and ""Hangman's Horse"" with Victor McClaglen in 1928), almost always as an extra. He moved to Columbia in 1931 and started getting better parts, then to Warners and finally to Lone Star in 1933 where he emerged as a singing cowboy (""Riders of Destiny"") and was teamed with the great Gabby Hayes.""The Dawn Rider"" was his 15th film with Lone Star, and he would make only one more  with them before they merged with Republic. Monogram churned out films by the month, usually in the summer, with little attention to detail or character development. Wayne said - ""For any actor trying to get on in the business, working at Monogram was not a good career move. Most of the contract players there may have had regular work, but they generally didn't move up from there into the major studios - they went down and that's the direction I thought I was headed.""Then in 1939 he made ""Stagecoach"" with John Ford, and his career started to look up. Stagecoach earned 5 Oscars including Best Picture. Wayne followed up with  ""Dark Command"" (1940) directed by Rail Walsh, and  then a series of war movies (e.g.,  ""Flying Tigers"" in 1942, ""The Fighting Seabees""  in 1944, ""Back to Bataan"" and ""They Were Expendable"" in 1945) and his classic westerns including ""3 Godfathers"" (1948),  ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""Red River"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949, ""Rio Bravo"" (1959), and ""The Alamo"" (1960) . Wayne was nominated for Best Actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949) and he would finally earn an Oscar for ""True Grit"" (1969).The film co-stars Marion Burns, who worked with Wayne again in ""Paradise Canyon"", and Yakima Canutt, with whom he started working in 1933. For Burns, this was the highlight of her career. She made a few more films, then did a little work in TV, and then retired completely.Yakima Canutt is a legendary stunt man. We was a world champion Rodeo rider and as a result of his friendship with Douglas Fairbanks, started appearing in films in 1915. He made nearly 50 silent films, and met Wayne in 1932. They made dozens of films together, and Canutt became Republic's top stunt man, appearing in Lone Ranger and Zorro series in addition to the westerns. In the 40s he made the transition to directing.This is a fairly standard B western that Monogram, Lone Star and Republic churned out every few weeks. In addition to John Wayne, their stable included Gabby Hayes, Bob Steele, Tim McCoy, and Johnny Mack Brown. Robert Bradbury was the writer and director for many of these films. These were known as the ""poverty row"" productions, made for about $10,000 each, and filmed at the famous Placerita Canyon Ranch in Newhall, California.Robert Bradbury (1886-1949) was the father of another 30s western star, Bob Steele (1907-1988), who was a good friend of Wayne from his USC years (Wayne and Steel appeared in 6 films together between 1953 and 1970). Bradbury's other son, Bob's twin, dubbed the songs Wayne sung in the Monogram films (and he used the money he made to pay for medical school). Bradbury made more than 100 films between and 1918 and 1941FWIW - Bradbury's 1926 silent film ""Davy Crockett at the Fall of the Alamo"" was Wayne's inspiration for his own 1960 Alamo film which he directed and in which he starred.There's very little to recommend the film. It is one of the better B westerns produced at the time and there is ample time to see how athletic the young Wayne was (he was 28 when the film was made). It's also one of the better roles for Canutt as the evil saloon keeper.",3,Fairly standard B western,1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,3698,"['Between', '1926', '1935', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'John', 'Wayne', 'appeared', 'more', '50', 'films', 'silent', 'films', 'were', 'mostly', 'Fox', 'worked', 'many', 'films', 'John', 'Ford', 'directing', 'e.g.', 'Four', 'Sons', 'Hangman', 'Horse', 'Victor', 'McClaglen', '1928', 'almost', 'always', 'extra', 'moved', 'Columbia', '1931', 'started', 'getting', 'better', 'parts', 'then', 'Warners', 'finally', 'Lone', 'Star', '1933', 'where', 'emerged', 'singing', 'cowboy', 'Riders', 'Destiny', 'was', 'teamed', 'great', 'Gabby', 'Hayes', 'Dawn', 'Rider', 'was', '15th', 'film', 'Lone', 'Star', 'would', 'make', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'merged', 'Republic', 'Monogram', 'churned', 'out', 'films', 'month', 'usually', 'summer', 'little', 'attention', 'detail', 'character', 'development', 'Wayne', 'said', 'actor', 'trying', 'get', 'business', 'working', 'Monogram', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'career', 'move', 'Most', 'contract', 'players', 'there', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'regular', 'work', 'generally', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'up', 'there', 'major', 'studios', 'went', 'down', 'direction', 'thought', 'was', 'headed', 'Then', '1939', 'made', 'Stagecoach', 'John', 'Ford', 'career', 'started', 'look', 'up', 'Stagecoach', 'earned', '5', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Wayne', 'followed', 'up', 'Dark', 'Command', '1940', 'directed', 'Rail', 'Walsh', 'then', 'series', 'war', 'movies', 'e.g.', 'Flying', 'Tigers', '1942', 'Fighting', 'Seabees', '1944', 'Back', 'Bataan', 'Were', 'Expendable', '1945', 'classic', 'westerns', 'including', '3', 'Godfathers', '1948', 'Fort', 'Apache', '1948', 'Red', 'River', '1948', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', '1949', 'Rio', 'Bravo', '1959', 'Alamo', '1960', 'Wayne', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Sands', 'Iwo', 'Jima', '1949', 'would', 'finally', 'earn', 'Oscar', 'True', 'Grit', '1969', '.The', 'film', 'co-stars', 'Marion', 'Burns', 'who', 'worked', 'Wayne', 'again', 'Paradise', 'Canyon', 'Yakima', 'Canutt', 'whom', 'started', 'working', '1933', 'Burns', 'was', 'highlight', 'career', 'made', 'few', 'more', 'films', 'then', 'did', 'little', 'work', 'TV', 'then', 'retired', 'completely.Yakima', 'Canutt', 'legendary', 'stunt', 'man', 'was', 'world', 'champion', 'Rodeo', 'rider', 'result', 'friendship', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'started', 'appearing', 'films', '1915', 'made', 'nearly', '50', 'silent', 'films', 'met', 'Wayne', '1932', 'made', 'dozens', 'films', 'together', 'Canutt', 'became', 'Republic', 'top', 'stunt', 'man', 'appearing', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Zorro', 'series', 'addition', 'westerns', '40s', 'made', 'transition', 'directing.This', 'fairly', 'standard', 'B', 'western', 'Monogram', 'Lone', 'Star', 'Republic', 'churned', 'out', 'few', 'weeks', 'addition', 'John', 'Wayne', 'stable', 'included', 'Gabby', 'Hayes', 'Bob', 'Steele', 'Tim', 'McCoy', 'Johnny', 'Mack', 'Brown', 'Robert', 'Bradbury', 'was', 'writer', 'director', 'many', 'films', 'were', 'known', 'poverty', 'row', 'productions', 'made', 'about', '10,000', 'filmed', 'famous', 'Placerita', 'Canyon', 'Ranch', 'Newhall', 'California.Robert', 'Bradbury', '1886-1949', 'was', 'father', '30s', 'western', 'star', 'Bob', 'Steele', '1907-1988', 'who', 'was', 'good', 'friend', 'Wayne', 'USC', 'years', 'Wayne', 'Steel', 'appeared', '6', 'films', 'together', '1953', '1970', 'Bradbury', 'other', 'son', 'Bob', 'twin', 'dubbed', 'songs', 'Wayne', 'sung', 'Monogram', 'films', 'used', 'money', 'made', 'pay', 'medical', 'school', 'Bradbury', 'made', 'more', '100', 'films', '1918', '1941FWIW', 'Bradbury', '1926', 'silent', 'film', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'Fall', 'Alamo', 'was', 'Wayne', 'inspiration', 'own', '1960', 'Alamo', 'film', 'directed', 'very', 'little', 'recommend', 'film', 'one', 'better', 'B', 'westerns', 'produced', 'time', 'ample', 'time', 'see', 'how', 'athletic', 'young', 'Wayne', 'was', 'was', '28', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'also', 'one', 'better', 'roles', 'Canutt', 'evil', 'saloon', 'keeper']",N/A
716467,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00006I03X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","&quot;The Dawn Rider&quot; is the penultimate B Western in the series of sixteen that a young John Wayne starred in for Lone Star/Monogram studio between 1933 and 1935.  Wayne plays John Mason who comes home in time to see his father (Joe DeGrasse) gunned down by bad guys.  Mason gives chase and manages to gun down three of them before being wounded himself.  Mason ends up being cared for by Alice Gordon (Marion Burns), who, in the small world that these B Westerns represents, turns out to be the the girl friend of the local bad guy, Ben (Reed Howes), but also the sister of the man who shot Mason's father, Rudd Gordon (Dennis Moore, aka Denny Meadows).  This is going to make a happy ending difficult and director Robert N. Bradbury does not really try, which is interesting in itself given this series.Legendary stuntman Yakima Canutt is back after an absence of a couple of films, although he does not get too do any thing particularly special this time around in terms of the stunts.  Canutt plays the saloon keeper when he is not doubling for Wayne or another actor in the action sequences.  George &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes is still absent and the comic relief comes from Nelson McDowell as Batest the undertaker, who complains the town is too healthy and if something does not happen soon he is going to have to vamoose.  Of course Mason and Gordon's gang take care of that.All of these Lone Star Westerns are in poor shape.  The sound is always scratchy and the picture blurred at times.  But then these oaters were made for $10,000 in five days, so we are talking the production values of a poverty row studio.  But for fans of the Duke it is interesting to back and see what he was like when he was learning his craft.  Just think of these little movies, all of which run under an hour, as representing John Wayne in grade school, and do not expect the title to have anything to really do with the character or plot.",4,An early John Wayne B Western without a happy ending,1087776000,"06 21, 2004",2004,1931,"['quot', 'Dawn', 'Rider', 'quot', 'penultimate', 'B', 'Western', 'series', 'sixteen', 'young', 'John', 'Wayne', 'starred', 'Lone', 'Star/Monogram', 'studio', '1933', '1935', 'Wayne', 'John', 'Mason', 'who', 'home', 'time', 'see', 'father', 'Joe', 'DeGrasse', 'gunned', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'Mason', 'chase', 'manages', 'gun', 'down', 'three', 'being', 'wounded', 'Mason', 'up', 'being', 'cared', 'Alice', 'Gordon', 'Marion', 'Burns', 'who', 'small', 'world', 'B', 'Westerns', 'out', 'be', 'girl', 'friend', 'local', 'bad', 'guy', 'Ben', 'Reed', 'Howes', 'also', 'sister', 'man', 'who', 'Mason', 'father', 'Rudd', 'Gordon', 'Dennis', 'Moore', 'Denny', 'Meadows', 'going', 'make', 'happy', 'ending', 'difficult', 'director', 'Robert', 'N.', 'Bradbury', 'not', 'really', 'try', 'interesting', 'given', 'series.Legendary', 'stuntman', 'Yakima', 'Canutt', 'back', 'absence', 'couple', 'films', 'not', 'get', 'too', 'do', 'thing', 'particularly', 'special', 'time', 'around', 'terms', 'stunts', 'Canutt', 'saloon', 'keeper', 'when', 'not', 'doubling', 'Wayne', 'actor', 'action', 'sequences', 'George', 'quot', 'Gabby', 'quot', 'Hayes', 'still', 'absent', 'comic', 'relief', 'Nelson', 'McDowell', 'Batest', 'undertaker', 'who', 'town', 'too', 'healthy', 'something', 'not', 'happen', 'soon', 'going', 'have', 'vamoose', 'course', 'Mason', 'Gordon', 'gang', 'take', 'care', 'that.All', 'Lone', 'Star', 'Westerns', 'are', 'poor', 'shape', 'sound', 'always', 'scratchy', 'picture', 'blurred', 'times', 'then', 'oaters', 'were', 'made', '10,000', 'five', 'days', 'are', 'talking', 'production', 'values', 'poverty', 'row', 'studio', 'fans', 'Duke', 'interesting', 'back', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'learning', 'craft', 'Just', 'think', 'little', 'movies', 'run', 'hour', 'representing', 'John', 'Wayne', 'grade', 'school', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'title', 'have', 'anything', 'really', 'do', 'character', 'plot']",N/A
