This series pummels one who exercises a willing suspension of disbelief, normally a pleasurable device when watching fiction, into the hard reality that he or she has been taken for a sucker.  Who is writing these screenplays?  Did they earn their chops playing mindless video games?  Are they sadomasochists who cannot conceive of healthy relationships? Is there some rule of the trade that demands a customer must never get a break?  What would be so bad about letting characters learn from their mistakes or achieve happy outcomes?  Must every episode depend on depravity, torture, insanity, betrayal, death, and despair?  What is wrong with occasionally allowing a prime suspect to be the real culprit?  Would it anger some fearsome god of thespians if a sympathetic, OCD-plagued protagonist were to gain release from his psychological torments and find happiness in a beautiful, sensitive woman who is his intelligent equal?Ah, well.

1437610,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B00527QY88,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[45, 47]","Viewers who saw the first two installments of Whitechapel will appreciate that there is a significant change in format this time round. Whereas the first two series were three part stories based on Jack the Ripper and The Kray Twins respectively, this time round we have three two part stories. Additionally these investigations are based much more loosely on historical crimes than the first two series. I imagine this is because the Ripper and the Krays are the only two major criminal activities in the Whitechapel area of London which most viewers will be familiar with.It is easy to see why this change has come about. Whitechapel was probably intended as a one off, but following its resounding success there was a lot of pressure to come up with a follow up. What we got was a farfetched tale involving clones of the Krays which stretched credibility to extremes. The powers that be clearly appreciated that this time the format had to move on. The result actually works rather well. The historical crimes are still real - you can google the Ratcliff Highway Murders , the Thames Torso Murders or the various masked murderer crimes mentioned on the show, and get the details. The fact that the crimes being investigated are more loosely based on these events makes for a much more realistic story line as opposed to the straight copycat replication of the earlier series.I thought that the three stories each worked although my personal favorite was the last of the three which was dark and shocking with a substantial sting in the tail. It certainly makes for good if not compulsive TV viewing. One thing I do not think is necessary though is for parts of the filming to be in the semi dark. I presume this is to conjure up visions of the atmospheric Whitechapel of the 1800s, but personally I thought it was unnecessary and did not add anything apart from straining the eyes. However, again Rupert Penry-Jones and Philip Davis put up a convincing performance as DI Chandler and DS Miles, and in the background is Edward Buchan, played by Steve Pemberton, the Ripper and Kray expert, whose knowledge clearly extends to other crimes of the Victorian era as he beavers away in the archives.I do hope we get more of Whitechapel, and in its new format I imagine there is much more scope to produce additional episodes. I would think the only limitation is if they feel they have to keep seeking out gruesome real life crimes to base it all on, but I really do not see why they should not make up a few of their own if they are struggling!",5,Dark and Shocking - Great Entertainment!,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,2542,"['Viewers', 'who', 'saw', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'Whitechapel', 'will', 'appreciate', 'significant', 'change', 'format', 'time', 'round', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'were', 'three', 'part', 'stories', 'based', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Kray', 'Twins', 'respectively', 'time', 'round', 'have', 'three', 'two', 'part', 'stories', 'Additionally', 'investigations', 'are', 'based', 'much', 'more', 'loosely', 'historical', 'crimes', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'imagine', 'Ripper', 'Krays', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'major', 'criminal', 'activities', 'Whitechapel', 'area', 'London', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'with.It', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'change', 'come', 'Whitechapel', 'was', 'probably', 'intended', 'one', 'off', 'following', 'resounding', 'success', 'there', 'was', 'lot', 'pressure', 'come', 'up', 'follow', 'up', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'farfetched', 'tale', 'involving', 'clones', 'Krays', 'stretched', 'credibility', 'extremes', 'powers', 'be', 'clearly', 'appreciated', 'time', 'format', 'had', 'move', 'result', 'actually', 'rather', 'well', 'historical', 'crimes', 'are', 'still', 'real', 'can', 'google', 'Ratcliff', 'Highway', 'Murders', 'Thames', 'Torso', 'Murders', 'various', 'masked', 'murderer', 'crimes', 'mentioned', 'show', 'get', 'details', 'fact', 'crimes', 'being', 'investigated', 'are', 'more', 'loosely', 'based', 'events', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'story', 'line', 'opposed', 'straight', 'copycat', 'replication', 'earlier', 'series.I', 'thought', 'three', 'stories', 'worked', 'personal', 'favorite', 'was', 'last', 'three', 'was', 'dark', 'shocking', 'substantial', 'sting', 'tail', 'certainly', 'good', 'not', 'compulsive', 'TV', 'viewing', 'One', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'necessary', 'though', 'parts', 'filming', 'be', 'semi', 'dark', 'presume', 'conjure', 'up', 'visions', 'atmospheric', 'Whitechapel', '1800s', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'apart', 'straining', 'eyes', 'However', 'again', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'Philip', 'Davis', 'put', 'up', 'convincing', 'performance', 'DI', 'Chandler', 'DS', 'Miles', 'background', 'Edward', 'Buchan', 'played', 'Steve', 'Pemberton', 'Ripper', 'Kray', 'expert', 'knowledge', 'clearly', 'other', 'crimes', 'Victorian', 'era', 'away', 'archives.I', 'do', 'hope', 'get', 'more', 'Whitechapel', 'new', 'format', 'imagine', 'much', 'more', 'scope', 'produce', 'additional', 'episodes', 'would', 'think', 'only', 'limitation', 'feel', 'have', 'keep', 'seeking', 'out', 'gruesome', 'real', 'life', 'crimes', 'base', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'why', 'should', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'few', 'own', 'are', 'struggling']",Whitechapel - Series 3 Region 2  UK

This program has been beautifully filmed, taking advantage of the history of London and how we view the various crimes committed over the centuries in this wonderfully mysterious city.Spoiler Alert:If you have not read about it, this excellent program was not renewed for a Season/Series 5. That is a shame and one which will surely go down as a huge mistake for ITV and the BBC. With its excellent production and acting talent, this series will be heralded in the future as one of the best ever produced. I am sure something new will be seen at some point in time on the BBC, as the British seem to have a special talent of the highest order for producing excellent stories, whether they be thrillers or mysteries. However, I am always puzzled as to why wonderful series are cancelled when they are at the top of their form and not struggling to produce new stories. I understand the actors and writers may want to move onto something new, and it is always desirable to go out while you're on top, but it is not what us fans like to see.

1437770,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00527QY88,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","For the third season of the popular crime-drama ""Whitechapel"", the format is changed in order to accommodate the demand for more episodes. The concept of the first two seasons involved a present-day investigative team looking into a string of copycat killings that were based on famous historical murders - firstJack the Ripperand thenthe Kray brothers, using a blend of contemporary tools and historical precedent to solve the crimes. Yet even by the time the Kray case was wrapped up, the formula was beginning to feel a little old, making it a wise decision to retool some of the basic elements of the show.Instead of a three-part miniseries, this season is six episodes long, with three crimes to solve (each one divided into two parts). To keep the element of historical intrigue that made the first season so popular, the show uses old murders as a basis for their storylines rather than a template, with enthusiastic researcher Edward Buchan (who helped the detectives out on their last two cases) installed in the police archives. His job is to provide historical insight on the team's cases, hopefully inspiring them toward a solution and working on the motto that history shouldn't be repeated.With only three of the six original team members left (Chandler, Miles and Kent), the opportunity is taken to introduce some more estrogen to the cast with the addition of Megan Riley, joining pathologist Caroline Llewyllen as a female presence to balance out not only the testosterone, but the overwhelming number of female murder victims. Also noteworthy is the wonderful rapport that exists between Chandler and Miles. Despite initially hating each other on sight, they're now confidants and friends, discussing everything from the cases, to family issues, to Chandler's OCD. Miles even fancies himself a bit of a matchmaker for Chandler, though it's not until the third episode that he expresses the (rather poignant) reasons why. In their conversations and interactions you can tell they trust each other implicitly. Now, if only Miles would start being nicer to Buchan...The crimes themselves are very grisly and macabre, with the general attitude of the show-runners being ""make everything creepy."" As such, even minor elements are designed to be unsettling and strange - at one point, the team questions a witness who is a creepy old voodoo lady. She's in the episode for less than half a minute, and she could just as easily have been a benign housewife in a dressing gown - but the show opts for a creepy old voodoo lady instead. Even the police headquarters and the investigative office is a dim, shadowy, ominous place. It all results in a show that is immensely unsettling to watch - perhaps to compensate for this overload of creepiness, there are moments of levity involving the interplay of characters and their families.As noted, the mysteries this time around are inspired by historical crimes rather than based on them, and the cases that Buchan uncovers - such as the Ratcliff Highway Murders and the Thames Torso Murders - are easily found on Wikipedia and other websites. There's also a chance to incorporate real police procedurals, and you end up picking up a lot of interesting tidbits: for instance, the pathologist comments that mass deaths usually involve families, with one killing the others as an extension of suicide (thus making the one featured in the show an anomaly) and later they comment that women are more likely to poison than men (thus leading the detectives to the conclusion that a poisoning/dismemberment case is the work of a couple).The first episode involves a young woman who goes to fetch bagels for her co-workers, only to find the place locked and bolted on her return. With the assistance of a police officer they break inside, only to find a massacre. Four people are dead, but there's no sign of a break-in and no discernable motive. Buchan uncovers a similar case in the archives, but the investigative team struggle to find a connection between suspects and victims - and then another massacre occurs.The second episode (my favourite) begins when a motorcyclist comes across a suburban fox - dragging a disembodied arm. A torso and a foot soon follow, both washed up by the Thames. With their only lead (and only witness) begin a fox, the team stake out its territory in the hopes that it will lead them to the source of the mutilated bodies. The pathologist comes up with a disturbing discovery: that before the girls were dismembered they were poisoned, thus bringing a whole new angle to the investigation.The final episode deals with an escapee from an insane asylum that killed his entire family for the sake of peace and quiet. A manhunt ensues, one that intensifies when classmates of the killer's original victim are targeted - as well as therapist Morgan Lamb. Chandler strikes up a rapport with the attractive Morgan, but the rest of the team are confused as to why the killer is interested in her - she doesn't fit the profile of the others.Unlike the others, this one is more of a thriller/horror than a crime/mystery, and though stories such as these will inevitably have some contrivances and implausibility, this one stretches things a bit far, with a huge coincidence regarding the timing of the deaths and a killer that seems almost super-human (which becomes even more improbably once he's been unmasked). It ends on a rather bleak note which may divide viewers, but thankfully a fourth season has been commissioned, which will perhaps give us some closure on the events that take place here.Though this season is certainly much darker and creepier than its predecessors (and that's saying a lot considering what seasons one and two encompassed) this is still a top-notch crime drama, with appealing characters, intelligent writing and plenty of scares.",5,"""What if We Could Use the Past as a Map to Guide Us Through Difficult Investigations?""",1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,5832,"['third',

Both have developed their characters into flesh and blood people with genuine cares and hurts.

Though it took a minute or two of viewing this very well made British thriller to believe the premise, I finally accepted the idea. Is it a copy cat or has the Ripper left a descendent to carry on his bloody rampage? To answer this question the producers of the series craft an excellent build up of suspense which require watching the first two episodes.After viewing such dreadful suspense one wonders how can they top that and maintain interest and believable stories in the ensuing episodes. The Brits do these detective stories better than anyone and Whitechapel is no exception. The last two episodes are especially interesting because of the OCD the protagonist DI Joeseph Chandler, played by Rupert Penry-Jones, suffers from.
