728079,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00007G1VS,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[5, 7]","INDICTMENT - THE McMARTIN TRIAL is an excellent 1985 made-for-TV movie about the McMartin family of California and how they, and most of their day-care center's employees, were prosecuted for allegations of child abuse for years in the 1980s; despite spending the most money a California criminal trial had ever cost the taxpayers, over all those years the prosecution didn't get a single guilty verdict. The McMartin daycare center had to be sacrificed to pay for the owner's criminal defense, its owner spent years in jail for no particular reason other than to satisfy the public's blood lust, and even non-relatives' lives were upset and put on hold while bizarre theories gathered, which finally withered under the glare of daylight.  Supposedly there was a secret tunnel linking the McMartin's day-care house to a location across the street from which small children were shipped out for carnal purposes.  How this squared with the fact that no single child had disappeared or turned up lost during this perverse saga was never explained, least of all by the authorites who rode this horse well past the point of human understanding.  While in the classroom pre-school aged children were, it was alleged, made to play in bizarre sex games and touch each other in forbidden places -- under the tape-recorded interrogations by a psychiatric social worker who had had no formal training in child abuse but proved expert at asking leading questions, using ""but Johnny said"" tactics and lobbing other such rhetorical foul balls at small children of about four to six years old.It turns out that what got the ball rolling in the first place were the ravings of one parent, a paranoid schizophrenic, whose other envisionings included alien visitation.  The prosecution knew this -- and hushed it up.  Mercedes Ruehl is excellent as the driven Southern California D.A. who preached justice but practiced procrusteanism in the way some evidence was gathered, kept, and enhanced, and worse yet, when contradictory evidence was ignored or destroyed.  James Woods is very good as the down-on-his-heels criminal defense lawyer who takes this case and found that it had a way of altering his life as well as the lives of all the other participants.  Even today there are people who stoutly maintain that the McMartins were sadists, pederasts and devil-worshippers; we have the Internet to thank for much of that because once hearsay gets out there, it becomes enshrined in print to the point where many people are willing to believe the worst, most horrific and most unlikely myths.INDICTMENT the movie has held up well; it's a clear indictment of a justice system propelled by headlines and power politics, and a society so often wrapped up in a climate of fear in which impossibilities were pushed into absurdity and then on from there.  One yearned for a truth-teller (think of the role Wilford Brimley played in ABSENCE OF MALICE), someone to come in and call nonsense nonsense and stop the insanity, but (the movie hints) the mass media added to and perpetuated the civil-right bending, ruinous Kafkaism wrought by prosecution and inflamed by much of the general public.  Definitely a movie to see and be enjoyed for its considerable dramatic entertainment value as well as its message, INDICTMENT does not condescend because it gives the 'bad guys' personalities and motives, and shows how personalities and motives can turn evil when the authorities who abuse their power become convinced that what they have been told is unconditionally true, and that nothing else is possible.

The story centers around the molestation charges hurled at the infamous Manhattan Beach pre-school, where head maven Virginia rules with either an iron fist or a mother's heart (depending which side you choose to believe) from her wheelchair. Joining Ma McMartin is her daughter Peggy and her grandchildren, Ray and Peggy Ann. There are also special appearances by Betty Radar and Babette Spitzler. James Woods delievers an inspiring performance as Ray's attorney, while Mercedes Rhuel & Lolita Davidovich play the ""villians,"" Lael Rubin and loose Kee MacFarlane. The film really gets to the heart of the argument that if ""children say it is true, they must be believed."" I went to school with a guy named FC Gaybo and he knew Kee personally. He said she'd sleep with anything on 2 legs, but that ""children don't lie about these types of things."" I found this quite an ignorant statement. It is also to note that the writers, Abby & Myra Mann had their home burned to the ground. Insanity! The film is campy too. Watch out for hilarious references to the Alligator Game and (my fave) Naked Movie Star (wish I knew how to play that!). The film also demonstrates the level of paranoia that engulped everyone involved. The mother of the first accuser (a drug addicted psychotic) hits the bottle and makes outrageous claims that the family dog was molested and that she is ""Jesus Johnson""!

728083,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B00007G1VS,Ernest Jagger,"[16, 17]","""Indictment: The McMartin Trial"" is an excellent film. I do not live very far from Manhattan Beach, and was once a junior lifeguard there. I still jog and bicycle down there when I get the chance. I do remember very vividly when these events occurred. One of the things that I don't know is whether or not the children were molested. However, I do remember how nearly everyone where I worked at the time presumed these people were guilty. Even the LA Times showed unflattering pictures of the accused. Therefore, I do believe that there was a frenzied and carnival-like demonizing of the McMartin family. The film itself is very good. (James Woods) gives an outstanding performance as the attorney who defends the McMartin family.There is no doubt in my mind that the public hysteria over the allegations this family was charged with, and the media hype, were responsible for a grave miscarriage of justice. I feel for the children too: As they were equally victims of an out-of-control legal system that failed them too! Mercedes Ruehl also gives an outstanding performance as the lead prosecutor who abused the power she was given. Her performance as the win-at-all-costs prosecutor, was absolutely stellar. Ruehl's character compliments the performance given by defense attorney Danny Davis (James Woods).Moreover, the entire cast was great in this film. With Henry Thomas [of ET fame] as the son accused of several counts of molestion; which would result in the longest trial ever; along with actress Shirley Knight, as the mother; and Sada Thompson as the matriarch of the family, this is one great film. And one sad chapter in the California legal system. Also, Lolita Davidovich gives an excellent performance as the prosecutors main line of attack in the molestation charges against the McMartin family: As her taped videos of the children led to many of the initial charges against the McMartins. The film is an HBO released film, therefore, as with many of their films it is not anamorphic or letter-boxed, but full screened. Maybe someday the film will be released in a better format. Otherwise, this is a 5 star film. Only the DVD format gives it minus half a star. Highly recommended.

The cast is uniformly good, but James Woods is exceptional, creating a three dimensional character, a sleazy lawyer who first takes the case solely for the fame, but whose cycnicism is worn away by the witch hunt hysteria engulfing his clients. The movie correctly indicts the district attorney, the Manhattan Beach PD, and above all the KABC-TV and Wayne Satz. There is, however, one glaring omission: the people of Los Angeles County get away almost scot free in this retelling. Poor Nicollette Sheridan, as Woods girlfriend, serves as a stand in for the population at large. I lived in the South Bay, where Manhattan Beach is located, during this time period, and the reaction of the majority of the population to what were, from the beginning, outrageous accusations, was Salem-like. Cars sported bumper stickers saying &#34;I believe the children!&#34; and if you expressed doubt, you were vilified, even threatened with physcial violence. Even after impossible stories about secret airplane flights, ritual animal sacrifice in local churches, and the killing of a horse on school grounds, you would be told &#34;children don't lie!&#34;  I don't know about you, but I was a child once and I lied with fluency whenever I thought it would keep me from being punished.",4,Riveting Retelling of a Modern Day Salem Witch Trial,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,1333,"['Good', 'retelling', 'awful', 'chapter', 'American', 'jurisprudence', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'good', 'James', 'Woods', 'exceptional', 'creating', 'three', 'dimensional', 'character', 'sleazy', 'lawyer', 'who', 'first', 'case', 'solely', 'fame', 'cycnicism', 'worn', 'away', 'witch', 'hunt', 'hysteria', 'engulfing', 'clients', 'movie', 'correctly', 'district', 'attorney', 'Manhattan', 'Beach', 'PD', 'KABC-TV', 'Wayne', 'Satz', 'however', 'one', 'glaring', 'omission', 'people', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'County', 'get', 'away', 'almost', 'scot', 'free', 'retelling', 'Poor', 'Nicollette', 'Sheridan', 'Woods', 'girlfriend', 'stand', 'population', 'large', 'lived', 'South', 'Bay', 'where', 'Manhattan', 'Beach', 'located', 'time', 'period', 'reaction', 'majority', 'population', 'what', 'were', 'beginning', 'outrageous', 'accusations', 'was', 'Salem-like', 'Cars', 'sported', 'bumper', 'stickers', 'saying', '34', 'believe', 'children', '34', 'expressed', 'doubt', 'were', 'vilified', 'even', 'threatened', 'physcial', 'violence', 'Even', 'impossible', 'stories', 'secret', 'airplane', 'flights', 'ritual', 'animal', 'sacrifice', 'local', 'churches', 'killing', 'horse', 'school', 'grounds', 'would', 'be', 'told', '34', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'lie', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'child', 'once', 'lied', 'fluency', 'whenever', 'thought', 'would', 'keep', 'being', 'punished']",N/A

728089,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B00007G1VS,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[1, 1]","I saw this first years ago, then saw it again recently. It's NOT to be missed.A product of what I have often referred to as &#34;the therapeutic state&#34; was a phenomenon of adolescent mysticism mixed with pop religion and delusional sanctimony known as &#34;Satanic Ritual Abuse&#34; (SRA) that was popular not too many years ago. If I'm not mistaken, it started with this, the longest and most expensive trial in history.A woman had her child in the McMartin's child care center in California. (Where else?) The woman claimed that her child had told her of ghastly rituals, devil worship, practices of the scale even then in terms of the morbid which allegedly took place there. The McMartins were arrested, and acted completely flabbergasted at the claims.Danny Davis, as portrayed by James Woods, represented them. He looked further into the issue. Now, I want to avoid too many spoilers, but if you want to check the film out yourself, you might want to skip this. But I'll keep it short:It seems the woman who complained was a raving alcoholic prone to bizarre delusions; the &#34;social worker,&#34; Kee McFarlane, an unlicensed MSW from the University of Maryland, masterfully portrayed by Lolita Davidovich, who was siding with the complainants asked the kids comically leading questions, thereby planting ideas and demanding of the kids that they confirm them before she'd let 'em go. What's more, she was living with the local television news anchor who'd made an &#34;issue&#34; out of it in the first place, something that didn't come out until Davis had investigated, and that put a whole new shade on the procedings.And the asst. dist. attorney, played by Mercedes Ruehl, another fantastic performance, was a zealot trying to score political points.I won't tell you the final verdict, except that the trial(s) went on for an unprecedented length of time.And, again, this started a fad, of SRA and other dubious phenomena, thoroughly investigated, by the way, by the FBI and others, which continues to this day. (There are many books available on the subject, &#34;Remembering Satan,&#34; &#34;Sybil Exposed,&#34; and &#34;Making Monsters&#34; come to mind right off.)Among the reasons I recommend this and related films and books is that the phenomenon isn't yet over. There are overzealous and pathological police and other law enforcement staff who'll pursue such fiascoes for their political or economic gain. And there's just enough &#34;religious&#34; zealotry that some will still take it seriously, costing us taxpayers immeasurably more than they're worth.Yes, true, it's a movie. And even Stephen Spielberg, one of Hollywood's Meisters, acknowledged when &#34;Lincoln&#34; was releasted that, &#34;It's a movie.&#34; But the subject is an important one.
