Hu ""USMC journalist, turned Emba...","[12, 14]","After watching the Ken Burn's documentary on Mark Twain's life, I looked forward with much anticipation to seeing this film. It was supposed to be a great social commentary about slavery and on the conflict between the Constitution and the reality of slavery. It was supposed to be a kind of mental journey that the viewer took by following the simple logic of a boy, who represented the ideas about black people from that time. And while the movie does repeat all the right lines, &quot;Well, then, I'll go to hell&quot; it doesn't do so with as much power as Ken Burns narrator did. It doesn't set up the real and present tension -- the level of religious faith at that time and just what Huck meant -- how powerfully people of that day feared doing what was wrong and how Huck was meant to really feel it was wrong to help Jim escape.The power of the soul-searching aspect of the book is really hard to capture on film. It's a good film, as it goes, but I had hoped for something explosive.",4,"It ain't right!

A shortened version was aired on a cable channel recently and I caught the last half of it, checked the Internet and was amazed to find it available in its full length on DVD.For anyone who hasn't seen it, this is the only film version of Mark Twain's classic that is true to the book, and it requires the production's full 3 hours and 33 minutes to accomplish this admirable task. The actors were well chosen, with the possible exception of Tom Sawyer, who didn't seen ""right"" to me. Never mind, he's only a bit player in Huck's story, and the rest of the principals do a fine job. Patrick Day is especially appealing in the title role. All the background, the land and water, the buildings, boats, and townspeople are exactly as you've seen them in your mind's eye when you read the book. I was amazed by this movie's completeness and its fidelity to Twain's work.If you have seen this production on TV you'll find this DVD quite acceptable though not real sharp. I noticed some grain in dark areas and a bit of edge ghosting in a few contrasty scenes. The aspect ratio is standard TV, 1.33:1. The sound is fine, although I had to turn my set's volume up.There is so much to see and discover in this masterpiece, I'm sure that I'll watch it again and again and find something new to delight me every time.

492882,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000005XRS,Monty Moonlight,"[14, 15]","My favorite version of Huck Finn will probably always be the Elijah Wood version. It took the original story and sped it up. It's non-stop adventure, with everything else you want from the story included as well. This version however, is not far behind while at the same time being very true to the book. Now the version you see here is the one I saw, I rented it just last night. But there is a version twice as long that is also available here on Amazon. The price is ridiculous since it is NOT a DVD, but rather two tapes, but I want it anyway! I can only assume that it includes everything this one left out, though this version is still fine in a pinch! Even with half of it's running time cut out it's the second best version of Huck Finn I've seen! The casting is great! Only exception is Tom. I mean, he wasn't bad, but didn't look quite as roguish as you'd expect. For a great Tom see Rascals and Robbers. Some of the acting is a little odd, and some is great! And I have to comment on the kid who plays Huck, a grown man by now I'm sure. He's the PERFECT Huck, and would have also played a perfect Young Indiana Jones had he had the chance! I mean he has the look and the act. There's one seen where you totally see his Harrison Fordishness come out at the end as he snaps at Tom and breaks down a door to free Jim! You fellow Tom and Huck fans, be sure to get this one, the long version if you can afford it, and remember to look for what I said, his extreme Indiana Jonesishness.
