792268,A21VGNU5959O85,B00013NDP0,CaterpillarGirl,"[2, 3]","Fear of the dark, is a horror movie that one might stumble upon and not give it a second glance, the cover art is very similar to many ""B"" horror flicks out these past three years (meaning it's ridiculously cheesy and contrived). Although it's not the best scary movie it was very entertaining. The story is simple, a young child Ryan who is 8 and has night terrors which are obviously all in his head according to his parents and therapists but they refuse to put him on medication, and his older brother Dale who is left to baby-sit him on a stormy night. The mother who is a sculptor riddles the house with these nightmarish metal torsos and monsters and I cannot understand knowing her kid has some serious mental issues why she insists on putting these art pieces all over the flipping house, they would scare a normal adult! The older brother Dale is a love sick teen, who loves his younger brother but thinks his fear of the dark is a bit immature and is constantly telling him to ""stop freaking out"" and ""there is nothing there is the dark that's not there in the light"" and  ""its all going to be fine I promise you nothing will happen to you"", yet leaves the poor child alone countless times in the dark! Well the parents leave for a party, the lights go out from the storm, and we see the things come out in the dark and try to terrorize poor Ryan. The dad has left some spotlights up in the attic (what a great place to leave them for the child who is afraid of the dark), Ryan changes into his ""dark"" outfit that has flashlights and light sticks, and pads attached to it and according to Dale he looks like a ""mental patient at a football game"". The things that are after Ryan, apparently look like this tall pale man with a long black overcoat, a black cowboy hat and is shirtless ( I am not quite sure what Ryan is scared of here with that visual, maybe he saw brokeback mountain) And this cowboy just clomps around and smiles a lot and likes to scratch walls and grab your feet if you leave them sticking out from under the covers. We also meet Dales love interest who could have been left out all together she actually in the movie TWICE reminisces about ""past"" things that have happened to her, complete with the tight focus on her face, the looking down, and the sad creepy music in the background.  Besides being annoying and afraid of Dobermans, she lends nothing to the film. In the end after CGI roaches, and insane clown ladies, and a lot of screaming and sweaty cowboys, Ryan saves the day, turns the generator on and poof everything is fine, OR IS IT?  I would recommend this if only to show an interior decorator how I would like my new house done up, that place was amazing!

792269,A21T2ZAT0QA0KO,B00013NDP0,ChildInside,"[0, 0]","This is a surprisingly fun to watch movie. Not fun as in 'comical', but that it had the right combination of things to inur you to the plot (and the characters, in particular) fairly easily.It's rather rare nowadays in movies, but I think 'Fear of the Dark' has got to be one of the very few movies out there to have characters (especially young characters) that doesn't grate on your nerves. They really are likable with distinct (non-typical) personalities. Truthfully,But enough of that, we watch this movie for its plot, correct? Well, in the plot department, I have to agree with many others viewers and say this is very well made. The movie is decently suspenseful and has good pacing to allow for build up.Of course, there are moments of nonsensical plot points. For example, Ryan is surprisingly very willing to go off alone as opposed to staying with someone he knows. Also, in a family with a child that can't get enough light...one would think they would be very big on fluorescent instead of incandescent light bulbs. Not only is the former a lot brighter, but as the father of the family admits, their electricity bills is costing a fortune.But I can't dwell on those too much. This is the horror genre -- illogical things is practically a requirement.Overall, though, I really do like the plot for its good suspense and its premise. If there are any real flaws which I feel could use some improvement, I think it's that the movie could have used a lot more subtlety. For example, it could have possibly made the monster more ambiguous/passive until later on in the film or perhaps make the supernatural less obvious (e.g. doors opening by themselves, TV operating without anyone's input, etc).But it doesn't really detract from the movie. Ultimately, to get to the point, I think this is a  fun film to watch, and one which I think would offer a nice bit of enjoyment for anyone looking for something in the horror genre.",4,"Nice suspense, good pacing, and good characterization",1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,1935,"['surprisingly', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'Not', 'fun', ""'comical"", 'had', 'right', 'combination', 'things', 'inur', 'plot', 'characters', 'particular', 'fairly', 'easily.It', 'rather', 'rare', 'nowadays', 'movies', 'think', 'Dark', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'there', 'have', 'characters', 'especially', 'young', 'characters', ""n't"", 'grate', 'nerves', 'really', 'are', 'likable', 'distinct', 'non-typical', 'personalities', 'Truthfully', 'enough', 'watch', 'movie', 'plot', 'correct', 'Well', 'plot', 'department', 'have', 'agree', 'many', 'others', 'viewers', 'say', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'decently', 'suspenseful', 'good', 'pacing', 'allow', 'build', 'up.Of', 'course', 'are', 'moments', 'nonsensical', 'plot', 'points', 'example', 'Ryan', 'surprisingly', 'very', 'willing', 'go', 'off', 'alone', 'as', 'opposed', 'staying', 'someone', 'Also', 'family', 'child', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'light', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'big', 'fluorescent', 'instead', 'incandescent', 'light', 'bulbs', 'Not', 'only', 'former', 'lot', 'brighter', 'father', 'family', 'admits', 'electricity', 'bills', 'costing', 'fortune.But', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'too', 'much', 'horror', 'genre', 'illogical', 'things', 'practically', 'requirement.Overall', 'really', 'do', 'plot', 'good', 'suspense', 'premise', 'are', 'real', 'flaws', 'feel', 'could', 'use', 'improvement', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'lot', 'more', 'subtlety', 'example', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'made', 'monster', 'more', 'ambiguous/passive', 'later', 'film', 'perhaps', 'make', 'supernatural', 'less', 'obvious', 'e.g', 'doors', 'opening', 'TV', 'operating', 'anyone', 'input', 'etc', '.But', ""n't"", 'really', 'detract', 'movie', 'Ultimately', 'get', 'point', 'think', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'one', 'think', 'would', 'offer', 'nice', 'bit', 'enjoyment', 'anyone', 'looking', 'something', 'horror', 'genre']",N/A

792273,A31A9GENAJYD64,B00013NDP0,David M. Rossi,"[1, 1]","As with many of this genre of movie, it is often what is left to the imagination of the viewer that is truly scariest. This is definitely an area that Fear Of The Dark excels at. When we actually do get to see some of what's scaring the people, particularly the boy who is our main character, its just not as effective. Oh, sure, the creatures are creepy enough, but all in all I prefer to watch suspenseful scenes where characters are afraid to take that next step, fear etched on their brows. More of those scenes might have propelled the movie to 5 stars becase it does have all the other traditional horror elements in good measure. Creepy music, a lightning storm that has cut the power and thereby increasing the frequency of these strange visitors who apparently are the dark itself coming alive. Glimpses of these monsters when the lightning is flickering was a particularly nice touch as when the lightning stopped, they just perfectly blended with the dark again. Morph scenes of the shadows transforming into the monsters in low level light was effective and standard computer generated fare for today's horror films. However, a scene of computer generated beetles was extremely unconvincing and terribly done. In this day and age where great computer effects can be a near perfect blend with live action, bad effects stick out like a sore thumb. Still, Fear Of The Dark has a lot of good things going for it that will keep horror fans on the edge of their seats. Plus, also in typical thriller form, there's a great finale that cries sequel.

We laughed out loud when Kevin Zeger's character, Dale, was smoking. Like Clinton (*cough*) he didn't inhale, although he took several drags on the cigarette. My question for that scene is: why bother having the kid smoke if he's not going to inhale? Obviously Zeger doesn't smoke, and for that I applaud him, as so many actors and actresses in Hollywood do.Regarding the silly occurrences.

Bascombe, this film fails the two most important credentials of any decent horror movie: it's not scary and the actors are truly awful. From the opening sequence, showing another slightly overweight pre-teen getting trapped in a basement (maybe Central Casting were having a sale on fat kids?), both a lousy script and no talent whatsoever (except possibly the abilities to over-act and waddle) to the closing scenes, complete with Mom and Dad and Morals (we almost expect to see Michael Landon waving at us from the corner!), 'Fear of the Dark' never once manages to create a sense of tension or of belief.This is achieved through several things. The first and most annoying feature that negates any form of scariness is Brian Billings, done up like a rotund little Terminator, mincing around and screaming like a B-Movie in a strange hybrid exoskeleton/light suit. It's a ridiculous, hilarious image totally out of place with the proposed 'feel' of the movie. The second truly awful thing in the mechanics of this film is the use of unstructured and time-lapse camera-work, which gives this feature film more of a feel of a low-budget TV Series, instead.Direction is pretty terrible.

This movie might be scary for pre-teens and the uninitiated, but for horror fans this is a tedious and barely watchable 86 minutes.The slip cover is convincing:  Its creepy, showing dark evil looking characters.  The back claims ""The best movie of it's kind since The Sixth Sense"" and ""In the tradition of The Ring and The Sixth Sense...""  which gives you almost no sense of what your in for watching this.  Pay close attention to the PG-13 for ""Some Terror"" rating.What the movie is in fact:  Overly long scenes make up the majority of the beginning. By the time the kids' parents are 'ready' to go out and leave their son (who is psychotically afraid of creatures in the dark to the extent that his family goes to unusual length to appease him) with his older brother, it already seems like it would be 2:00 in the morning.  Its drug out way to far as if this was a TV episode turned into a movie.  Once the parents leave, the power goes out and the older brother begins to see things too. There are some thrill moments and some creepy characters who are barely on screen, do little, and may or may not have ever been there.  In the end there is a nice touchy-feely family moment. Seriously, its very much like watching a ""7th heaven"" episode about fear and how you can overcome it with the help of family.  Its terribly touching.  Theres no gore, nor violence, nor nudity, nor language.  Just good wholesome family moments with some ""scary"" moments if you can make it through the bad acting.This frankly is a family movie (truly, an overly long TV episode) marketed as a horror movie.  If you want a scary movie to watch with young kids, this is prime material.  It will satisfy the young.  If you mistake this as a horror movie as they suggest, you will likely hate this.",2,like a scary 7th heaven episode,1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,1858,"['warning', 'people', 'who', 'horror', 'movies', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'scary', 'pre-teens', 'uninitiated', 'horror', 'fans', 'tedious', 'barely', 'watchable', '86', 'minutes.The', 'slip', 'cover', 'convincing', 'creepy', 'showing', 'dark', 'evil', 'looking', 'characters', 'back', 'claims', 'best', 'movie', 'kind', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'tradition', 'Ring', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'almost', 'sense', 'what', 'watching', 'Pay', 'close', 'attention', 'PG-13', 'Terror', 'rating.What', 'movie', 'fact', 'Overly', 'long', 'scenes', 'make', 'up', 'majority', 'beginning', 'time', 'kids', 'parents', 'are', ""'ready"", 'go', 'out', 'leave', 'son', 'who', 'psychotically', 'afraid', 'creatures', 'dark', 'extent', 'family', 'unusual', 'length', 'appease', 'older', 'brother', 'already', 'would', 'be', '2:00', 'morning', 'drug', 'out', 'way', 'far', 'was', 'TV', 'episode', 'turned', 'movie', 'parents', 'leave', 'power', 'out', 'older', 'brother', 'see', 'things', 'too', 'are', 'thrill', 'moments', 'creepy', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'barely', 'screen', 'do', 'little', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'there', 'end', 'nice', 'touchy-feely', 'family', 'moment', 'Seriously', 'very', 'much', 'watching', '7th', 'heaven', 'episode', 'fear', 'how', 'can', 'overcome', 'help', 'family', 'terribly', 'touching', 'gore', 'violence', 'nudity', 'language', 'Just', 'good', 'wholesome', 'family', 'moments', 'scary', 'moments', 'can', 'make', 'bad', 'acting.This', 'frankly', 'family', 'movie', 'truly', 'overly', 'long', 'TV', 'episode', 'marketed', 'horror', 'movie', 'want', 'scary', 'movie', 'watch', 'young', 'kids', 'prime', 'material', 'will', 'satisfy', 'young', 'mistake', 'horror', 'movie', 'suggest', 'will', 'likely', 'hate']",N/A

I've gotten into the habit of not renting PG-13 movies because I love the gore and violence and terror of true horror movies that are rated R. However, I rented this movie because the box made it look scary. There are some suspenseful scenes in this movie as we see a young boy who is terrified of the dark.No one understands his fears, even his parents. One night, while the parents went out, the young boy was left home with his older brother. Well, here comes a storm and the lights go out. We get to see monsters/ghosts appear during some pretty good lightning scenes. Without going on and on about the details, I'd just say that I'd recommend renting this film.

792298,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00013NDP0,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[7, 7]","Okay, I'll admit right off that his film has plenty of silly nonsense in it, moments of bad acting, and poor dialogue; however, there is also plenty to enjoy too.This story of an older child with an obsessive fear of the dark is enjoyable in spite of it's obvious flaws because we can all relate to this time period in our lives when we feared the ""thing under our bed"" and the ""monster in the closet.""  Nearly every child has had a fear of the dark at some point in his or her life.  This film exploits that fear and does so rather well.We can also relate to the sibling rivalry and sibling love apparent in this film.  The acting can be stiff in places and feel forced, but in most other places it is surprisingly sincere.  I blame the director for this inconsistency more than the actors who can obviously act.  It's the director that fails to get the best out of them on a few occasions.By the way, the mother is played by the ageless wonder Linda Purl who was a television stable for two decades and most remembered as Andy Griffth's daughter on the series ""Matlock"" (sorry, no link as it hasn't been released on DVD yet).  In any event, when you see her, you'd swear you were looking at an older, but still beautiful Charlize Theron.Well, moving right along . . . The storyline is rather clever in spite of the ""been there done that"" feel to it.  The dialogue is less than clever and certainly isn't consistent in quality as it ranges from sweet, sincere, and believable to corny, phony and clich&eacute;d.  The actors again should be given credit for delivering these lines as best as they could.The atmospheric direction, photography, and setting are where this story really excels.  Nearly every room, closet, mirror, and corner has something lurking in it.  This provides terrific suspense and numerous ""jump up from your seat"" moments.I was pleasantly surprised with the overall quality of this film and it is rather family friendly for a horror flick.  There is no sex, gore, or violence really.  The PG-13 rating is for exactly what it says on the DVD box: ""For Frightening Images.""  My kids (11 & 15) jumped and let out a small scream in a few places, but laughed right after that.Simply put: this film is good popcorn fun for the whole family (ages 10 and up).",4,"There is fear in ""Fear of the Dark""",1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,2275,"['Okay', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'right', 'off', 'film', 'plenty', 'silly', 'nonsense', 'moments', 'bad', 'acting', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'however', 'also', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'too.This', 'story', 'older', 'child', 'obsessive', 'fear', 'dark', 'enjoyable', 'spite', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'can', 'relate', 'time', 'period', 'lives', 'when', 'feared', 'thing', 'bed', 'monster', 'closet', 'Nearly', 'child', 'had', 'fear', 'dark', 'point', 'life', 'film', 'fear', 'so', 'rather', 'well.We', 'can', 'also', 'relate', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'sibling', 'love', 'apparent', 'film', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'stiff', 'places', 'feel', 'forced', 'most', 'other', 'places', 'surprisingly', 'sincere', 'blame', 'director', 'inconsistency', 'more', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'obviously', 'act', 'director', 'get', 'best', 'few', 'way', 'mother', 'played', 'ageless', 'wonder', 'Linda', 'Purl', 'who', 'was', 'television', 'stable', 'two', 'decades', 'most', 'remembered', 'Andy', 'Griffth', 'daughter', 'series', 'Matlock', 'sorry', 'link', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'yet', 'event', 'when', 'see', ""'d"", 'swear', 'were', 'looking', 'older', 'still', 'beautiful', 'Charlize', 'Theron.Well', 'moving', 'right', 'along', 'storyline', 'rather', 'clever', 'spite', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'feel', 'dialogue', 'less', 'clever', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'quality', 'sweet', 'sincere', 'believable', 'corny', 'phony', 'clich', 'eacute', 'actors', 'again', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'credit', 'delivering', 'lines', 'as', 'best', 'could.The', 'atmospheric', 'direction', 'photography', 'setting', 'are', 'where', 'story', 'really', 'excels', 'Nearly', 'room', 'closet', 'mirror', 'corner', 'something', 'lurking', 'terrific', 'suspense', 'numerous', 'jump', 'up', 'seat', 'moments.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'rather', 'family', 'friendly', 'horror', 'flick', 'sex', 'gore', 'violence', 'really', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'exactly', 'what', 'DVD', 'box', 'Frightening', 'Images', 'kids', '11', '15', 'jumped', 'let', 'out', 'small', 'scream', 'few', 'places', 'laughed', 'right', 'that.Simply', 'put', 'film', 'good', 'popcorn', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', '10', 'up']",N/A
