I am very much into blu-ray high def and love the dazzling sights and sounds of this technology. I recently came across this disc and knew I wanted to see it. My wife, who is a much bigger fan of Elton John than I am, immediately wanted to purchase this. I was not at all disappointed by this concert, and in fact, I must say, that it gave incredible new life to songs that are many years old. The concert was long, over three hours, but it actually was an incredible amount of fun to see and hear. The music itself was varied and fantastic. The high def picture and sound of this blu ray edition was nothing short of amazing. I watched it on an LG BH200 hi def player, which is connected to a Toshiba 42 in 1080p LCD television. My wife and I were both blown away by the dazzling crisp, clear, razor-sharp images of the video and the 5.1 DD surround sound.

I remeber nagging my father to have his friend who has always managed to score us tickets to great concerts work her magic for this legendary show. Unfortunately, we were not able to attned this show, and I remember being incredibly disappointed for weeks, especially since the live coverage.Fortunately, a dvd of the complete show was released and I snatched it up immediately. I was not allowed to open it until my Birthday, so I awaited patiently until the big day came. When it did, me and my dad watched it in our basement, on the new Plasma we had pruchased, and we were blown away by what we had missed.Right from the opening ""Sixty Years On,"" you instantly feel like you're there. You can defintiely feel the energy from the crowd, and the sound and picture quality is first rate. If you have a top quality sound system, I suggest playing it LOUD.As for Elton himself, he has simply never been better. His voice has darkened with age, and his top range is kaput, but he plays and sings better than ever. At a point in his career where he could easily do an entire show on autopilot, he sings these songs with more passion and fervor than he did 30 years ago. Even seemingly tired hits like ""Bennie And The Jets"" and ""Philadelphia Freedom"" sounds fresh and energized.The show's setlist is a solid mix of rare studio track and big hits. The first half is a veritable selection of rarely heard studio tracks that Elton has a ball dusting off, including ""Madman Across The Water,"" the chilling ""Where To Now, St. Peter,"" ""Hercules,"" ""Ballad Of A Well Known Gun,"" ""Holiday Inn"" and ""High Flying Bird.""The second half is a top notch menu of Greatest Hits, with a few surprises such as ""Levon,"" ""Honky Cat,"" (the first time in years it has been performed with a full band) and a thrilling ""All The Young Girls Love Alice."" Elton and his band are absolutely ferocious throughout, playing with a bite and energy not since Elton's 1970s' glory days.Disc 2 contains several bonus performances from 1970 to 2006, including a selection of New York based performances, among them a haunting performance of ""We All Fall In Love Sometimes / Curtains"" at a 2005 Madison Square Garden concert, as well as legendary performances such as his 1976 solo concert in Edinburgh and his phenomenal 1984 Night And Day concerts at Wembley Stadium.Overall, this is an absolutely thrilling concert dvd, especially for those unable to attned the real show.

I have seen Elton in concert at least 15 times but I have never him play a set this extensive.  As all Elton fans know, Elton mainly concentrates on his big 70s hits when he plays concerts, but he has MANY MANY other GREAT songs that he rarely plays live.  In this set he plays rare songs I love like ""High Flying Bird"", ""Where to Now St. Peter"", ""Holiday Inn"", and many more.  My only MINOR complaint is that he still concentrates on pre-1980 music even for the obscure songs.  He has written many great songs since then that we may never get to hear live.  Also rare is that fact that he is playing with an orchestra and choir in this concert.  The blu-ray image is clear, the sound great.  I own both the DVD and the Blu-ray, because the DVD contains ""Live, Rare & Unseen"" material that the blu-ray for some reason does not contain.

The 4-disc box set included a decent performance in the youth choir set, but that exception, we've been handed terrible audio quality, incomplete setlists, etc.This DVD makes up for all of that, and finally delivers the EJ concert that new and old fans can appreciate as the best of him in this phase of his career. It's every bit as landmark as his classic performance with the Sydney symphony twenty years ago.As a longtime fan, the inclusion of less commercial hits such as High Flying Bird, Where To Now St. Peter, Ballad of a Well Known Gun, and a few others, is something special, especially since some of these have not been performed with the current band before, but the interpretations and performances are excellent.The sheer number of songs performed (3 1/2 hours!) in the concert is remarkable. The hits are (mostly) all included-- Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Candle In The Wind are the two that come to mind as as most likely to be missed by casual fans.Elton's piano playing and the band fills are not the same old bits you might have heard if you attended any one of his concerts in the last ten years or so-- they have really made an effort to make this performance unique, and reasserted the band's and EJ's cohesiveness in the process. It's what you would expect from them at this stage in their evolution with no sense of jadedness. Amazing given the almost insane number of performances they have been churning out in recent years!I am always amazed at the number of little interpretations within the details of some of the most repeated favorites. Elton's constant re-working and tweaking of the Rocket Man solo, for example, and if you've heard Your Song a thousand times live, I think you might hear it performed just a little bit different almost every time, including this concert's send-off finale. All of this makes the whole show compelling even for fans who have seen live him dozens of times before.There are also some fantastic extras included. In all, over 5 hours of quality music and performances!So, if you have been disappointed in prior DVD releases from EJ, or if you are fan looking for something new from him, this DVD is a sure favorite. It is easily the most definitive and entertaining release of any kind from him since his life and career were reformed in the early 1990's.",5,"Finally, the Elton John DVD worth owning!

Among the highlights include memorable performances of such early Elton John classics as ""Where to Now Saint Peter?"", ""Hercules"" and ""High Flying Bird"", as well as more recent hits such as ""Empty Garden"" - his memorable tribute to John Lennon - ""Sad Songs (Say So Much)"", ""Something About The Way You Look Tonight"", and last, but not least, ""The Bridge"", from his latest album, ""The Captain and The Kid"".

Look at that price! Just how can anyone go wrong? Elton 60: Live at Madison Square Garden just has to be one of the biggest bargains of the decade!Personally, I prefer his work fairly solidly up through Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, but even from that point on, there remain myriad songs I like. Elton John is one of the few artists of the era who can be very commercial, yet who can simultaneously appeal to the most demanding music lovers.The first of the discs features the concert itself and is a well-balanced set of the older and the newer with emphasis on the ""hits"" but larded with enough more obscure quality tunes to keep those impatient with top-40 songs listening.The second disc features an equally diverse raft of songs culled from a variety of international shows. The beauty of this disc is that it gives the viewer the opportunity to see John at different points in his long and illustrious career. There is also a clutch of songs at the end that have some lyrical connection to New York City. Why is that important? Well, since the main concert itself was filmed at NYC's Madison Square Garden, that last group of songs serves to reinforce the importance of NYC both to Elton John personally, and to his career.Some, like myself, appreciate John mostly for his music. When he first appeared on the scene, he was quite ahead of his time. I am happy to have had the opportunity to see him play San Diego in the early 70s when few knew much about him.Others like EJ for the spectacle and the often outlandish costumes.

His piano riffs alone made it worthwhile.  He's got such short, stubby fingers, but they can really fly, and he seemed to have plenty of energy to get through a long concert.  Even my husband, who's a jazz fan and hard to please musically, got off on his piano playing.  I found this DVD set especially fun because I dislike going to concerts in person, so this was a way to participate that eliminated all the hassle.  The birthday segment in the middle was, I guess, necessary but awkward (thanks to Robin Williams, who kept interrupting poor Bernie Taupin).  But the only real criticism I have is that Elton's enunciation was uniformly poor (either that or it was the acoustics of Madison Square Garden).  Interestingly, it was much easier to understand the lyrics in the videos of past Elton John performances that were included. Anyway, I highly recommend this DVD set.",4,Elton riffs make it worthwhile,1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,1376,"['must', 'confess', 'even', ""'re"", 'practically', 'same', 'age', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'adult', 'life', 'listening', 'enjoying', 'Elton', 'John', ""'ve"", 'never', 'bought', 'music', 'just', 'recently', 'happily', 'indulging', 'Macca', 'Good', 'Evening', 'NYC', 'Electric', 'Arguments', 'ordered', 'Amazon', 'decided', 'go', 'first', 'Elton', 'John', 'purchase', 'chose', 'Elton', '60', 'looked', 'would', 'be', 'fairly', 'comprehensive', 'judging', 'reviews', 'would', 'present', 'Elton', 'mature', 'technical', 'best', 'piano', 'riffs', 'alone', 'made', 'worthwhile', 'got', 'such', 'short', 'stubby', 'fingers', 'can', 'really', 'fly', 'seemed', 'have', 'plenty', 'energy', 'get', 'long', 'concert', 'Even', 'husband', 'who', 'jazz', 'fan', 'hard', 'please', 'musically', 'got', 'off', 'piano', 'playing', 'found', 'DVD', 'set', 'especially', 'fun', 'dislike', 'going', 'concerts', 'person', 'was', 'way', 'participate', 'eliminated', 'hassle', 'birthday', 'segment', 'middle', 'was', 'guess', 'necessary', 'awkward', 'thanks', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'kept', 'interrupting', 'poor', 'Bernie', 'Taupin', 'only', 'real', 'criticism', 'have', 'Elton', 'enunciation', 'was', 'uniformly', 'poor', 'was', 'acoustics', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'Interestingly', 'was', 'much', 'easier', 'understand', 'lyrics', 'videos', 'past', 'Elton', 'John', 'performances', 'were', 'included', 'Anyway', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set']",N/A

Recorded on his 60th birthday at his 60th performance at Madison Square Garden, this DVD excels in pure entertainment satisfaction.  Over two DVD's you witness thirty-three classic songs from over the last five decades including such little performed gems like, ""Hercules"" and ""Roy Rogers"".  The standards like, ""Crocodile Rock"" and ""Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding"" are also lent out in slightly new versions that more than please.Unlike the Madison Square Garden show he previously released with shots of fans over-riding the stage show; this one showcases those people as well as dozens of famous political, musical and acting celebrities.  Robin Williams and Whoopie Goldberg bring on a fantastic, ""Happy Birthday"" and Bernie Taupin, who never appears on stage, gives a heart-felt salute to Elton on his birthday.  It's all amazingly good fun and very emotional.The light show is fantastic and the sound is pin-point perfect with a large young choir singing backstage that enhances the performance like no other Elton John has given.  It truly feels like the celebration in New York City that night was something very special.That's not all.  This double disc set also includes eighteen ""live, rare & unseen"" performances from over the years that are a stunning reminder of what a fantastic musician Elton John is.  On top of that, there is a section called, ""Elton's New York Stories"" that includes four personal emotional song videos of Elton that just pack more of a whollop you would not expect.The sound quality (DVD, dts, 5.1) is superb enough to hear audience members actually talking and the band never sounded more crisp.

After seeing this 2-DVD concert 4 or 5 times via Netflix rental, I thought, ""Oh, I've GOT to get this 2-DVD set!"", so I asked one of my maternal aunts to get it for me for my birthday, last year, and she did. I'm 44 years old & Elton John is one of my most favorite non-heavy metal singer-songwriters and I've been a fan of his ever since I was 6 years old. Also, despite the length of the main concert, almost 3-and-a-half hours, I try to watch it as often as I can! I love everything about this 2-DVD concert: 1. the set-list, from ""60 Years On"" to ""Your Song"", which, I must admit, the latter (""Your Song""), gets me very emotional 'cause it makes me think of my mom (God rest her soul) 'cause that was her most favorite Elton John song. Also, I love the different background displays that are shown on the LCD screen behind the stage 'cause there's so many words to describe them, colorful, beautiful & brilliant are just a few that come to mind. Also, the fact that so many celebrities were in the audience like Robin Williams, Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Caine, former president Bill Clinton, Kiefer Sutherland and, most surprisingly, heavy metal's ""Prince Of Darkness"", Ozzy Osbourne and his wife/manager Sharon. I also like how well his band performs and that, on most of the songs, the Brooklyn Youth Chorus provides backing vocals. Plus the fact that this performance celebrates, not only his 60th birthday, but the 60th time he's played at Madison Square Garden. Also the special features are FANTASTIC!

Plus he has some additional videos of his songs that reflect his love for New York City, including his tribute to his friend John Lennon.Well, this Blu-Ray version just gives you his concert from 2007, which is pretty decent.  I'd personally rather have his ""One Night Only"" concert remastered in High Definition because he seemed a lot more energetic at the time, plus he had many famous guests appear on the stage with him.

1097808,A13IKSGDYNBNQS,B000UZD4AS,S J Buck,"[0, 0]","Without the rare and unseen footage this wouldn't get five stars from me. It IS a special concert and a true celebration of Elton John's unique musical gifts and of course his 60th Birthday. Sadly as Elton John has got older his voice has become a less expressive musical instrument. I say this as huge fan of the artist. Its not a criticism, sadly age catches up with all of us and Elton is as human as the rest of us.If you decide to watch some of the rare and unseen concert footage before you watch the main concert, this is when the limitations in Eltons voice becomes painfully obvious. That said there are some performances in the birthday concert that are better than the archive ones. Honky Cat being one example.Credit then to Elton John that when he sings a song like 'Where to now St Peter', where in the past the melody required him to sing falsetto he has now changed the melody to work with his less flexible voice. Lesser artists would cheat and have somebody else sing the high notes. Its a great occasion and for a man of 60 he still is the ultimate rock showman. How many other artists of Elton's era are doing 3 hour stage shows. Not many did in the 70's let alone now. Songs that haven't been performed live since the 70's are resurrected like ""Ballad of a well known Gun"" and some of the best songs from his recent albums like ""Tinderbox"" (incredibly catchy) are performed on a great stage set which is a wonder of lighting and video.The rare and unseen footage is a treasure trove of classic footage. Noteably excellent are the 'Sounds for Saturday' performances with only Dee and Nigel (on bass and drums respectively). Four solo Piano performances from the Edinburgh playhouse are very good and a 2001 performance for a Top of the Pops special of ""This Train don't Stop There Anymore"", which is my favourite recent Elton John song is magnificent.",5,Good show and great rare footage,1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,1871,"['rare', 'unseen', 'footage', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'five', 'stars', 'special', 'concert', 'true', 'celebration', 'Elton', 'John', 'unique', 'musical', 'gifts', 'course', '60th', 'Birthday', 'Sadly', 'Elton', 'John', 'got', 'voice', 'become', 'less', 'expressive', 'musical', 'instrument', 'say', 'huge', 'fan', 'artist', 'not', 'criticism', 'sadly', 'age', 'up', 'Elton', 'as', 'human', 'rest', 'us.If', 'decide', 'watch', 'rare', 'unseen', 'concert', 'footage', 'watch', 'main', 'concert', 'when', 'limitations', 'Eltons', 'voice', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'said', 'are', 'performances', 'birthday', 'concert', 'are', 'better', 'archive', 'ones', 'Honky', 'Cat', 'being', 'one', 'example.Credit', 'then', 'Elton', 'John', 'when', 'song', ""'Where"", 'now', 'St', 'Peter', 'where', 'past', 'melody', 'required', 'sing', 'falsetto', 'now', 'changed', 'melody', 'work', 'less', 'flexible', 'voice', 'Lesser', 'artists', 'would', 'cheat', 'have', 'somebody', 'else', 'sing', 'high', 'notes', 'great', 'occasion', 'man', '60', 'still', 'ultimate', 'rock', 'showman', 'How', 'many', 'other', 'artists', 'Elton', 'era', 'are', 'doing', '3', 'hour', 'stage', 'shows', 'Not', 'many', 'did', '70', 'let', 'alone', 'now', 'Songs', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'performed', 'live', '70', 'are', 'resurrected', 'Ballad', 'well', 'known', 'Gun', 'best', 'songs', 'recent', 'albums', 'Tinderbox', 'incredibly', 'catchy', 'are', 'performed', 'great', 'stage', 'set', 'wonder', 'lighting', 'video.The', 'rare', 'unseen', 'footage', 'treasure', 'trove', 'classic', 'footage', 'Noteably', 'excellent', 'are', ""'Sounds"", 'Saturday', 'performances', 'only', 'Dee', 'Nigel', 'bass', 'drums', 'respectively', 'Four', 'solo', 'Piano', 'performances', 'Edinburgh', 'playhouse', 'are', 'very', 'good', '2001', 'performance', 'Top', 'Pops', 'special', 'Train', 'do', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Anymore', 'favourite', 'recent', 'Elton', 'John', 'song', 'magnificent']",N/A

1097810,A3EBNTLB904L5B,B000UZD4AS,Steven M. Gledhill,"[4, 4]","This performance was indeed classic Elton John.  The concert is some three hours long.  EJ tells the audience, ""We're going to be here a long time. We had to throw out 20 songs.""  Considering songs like ""All the Young Girls Love Alice"", ""Roy Rogers"", ""Hercules"", ""Holiday Inn"", ""Better Off Dead"", and other deep album cuts made the set list, it leads me to wonder which songs got cut from the list?  If the songs that were cut were his hits since the 90s then that's fine with me.  But I certainly would have enjoyed more from ""Goodbye Yellowbrick Road"" and ""Captain Fantastic"".It is an amazing performance with extended versions of most of his great songs.  ""Mad Man Across the Water"" has some jazz-like piano from EJ, as does ""Benny and the Jets"" and ""Rocket Man"".  ""Rocket Man"" is over 13 minutes long as EJ and Davey Johnstone get bluesy with a piano-guitar thing.  My personal favorites from Yellowbrick Road, ""Saturday Night's Alright..."" and ""Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding"" are the icing on the cake.A reviewer or two have complained about the Brooklyn Youth Chorus kids.  I thought they were fantastic.  These kids ranging in age from maybe 10 years old through high school age could sing.  There are dozens of them, and they are stationed above and behind the band.  I found it kind of awkward that young kids are belting out ""better off dead...better off dead"" and ""bitch...bitch"".  But it was cool that these kids were told to relax and have a great time out there as they were very lively and spontaneous, rockin' and groovin' to tunes decades older than they are.The visual was fantastic and the audio almost top knotch.  EJ's piano was recorded better than any other live performance, but once yet again Johnstone's guitar is considered a back ground instrument, for the most part.  During the extended jam in ""Rocket Man"" he's echoing EJ's piano chops on acoustic but you barely hear it (When he went in electric he was more audible).  His solos in ""Love Lies Bleeding"" are barely audible---aggrevating.  When I saw this band around '80 or '81, I remember that Davey Johnstone's guitar was big time for 3 hours.  You heard every note, if memory serves.  They were a rock band that night, starting with his chops on ""Funeral/Love Lies Bleeding"" to open that show.  Only the ""Barcelona"" DVD is Johnstone a bit livelier in the mix.  My other miner complaint is the bottom end in the audio is lacking.  You hear bass but you don't really feel it.  The kick drum should be thumping me in the chest, and it's just there.  Otherwise, like I said, EJ's vocals and piano has never been recorded better.  Solid full audio mix with the kids as well.Cameramen, throughout the event, located several celebrities in the audience, such as Michael Caine, Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, Bill Clinton (minus Hillary---if he had a date, you couldn't see her), Elizabeth Hurley, and Anne Hathaway.The concert is split over 2 discs, and the old live footage is split over the same 2 discs, which is odd.  I know I have several complaints for a 5-star review.  It's still a great buy, and a lot of product for the money.  It must have been a phenominal night, and I heartily recommend the purchase of this show, even if you already own ""One Night"" from MSG.  This is a superior performance over that one.  There are no musical guests on Elton 60 to ruin the classics---a very good thing.
