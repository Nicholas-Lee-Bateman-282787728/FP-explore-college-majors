There is a big difference between the suffering of the warmongers and their opponents torn out of their ordinary civilian lives into this nightmare spiral NOT of their own making.  The suffering that the crew endured is unimaginable and absolutely unfair and frankly, if we are about to go to war again or if the Whale Warriors are in danger of getting attacked and sunk at sea, we should have cleared the oceans of shark life.2.  Public opinion absolutely must be ignored - the example of McVay's treatment and only posthumous clearance instructs all of us to understand that injustice in one's lifetime just IS.  Public opinion however undeserved may be intentionally designed against a person and you just have to deal with it.  I disagree with McVay's suicide given the unbelievable suffering of the crew many of whom did everything they could to surivive.  Suicide seems disrespectful.I think the casting of character actors not necessarily likeable and pleasant was intentional.  It reminds me that they were fellow civilians until December 7, 1941.We should have gps implants so that no one becomes a castaway or a POW.The USS Indianapolis does not deserve to be most remembered for the plight of the crew after its sinking.  According to its wikipedia entry, the USS Indianapolis was always hunting the Japanese after Pearl Harbor and always protecting soldiers in the Pacific often engaging Japanese ships and aircraft so the enemy would have marked the USS Indianapolis and especially after their defeat upon learning that the ship delivered the uranium for Litte Boy.  A petty vindictive loser would hunt down the crew related to the atomic bombings so the highly publicized injustice against McVay and his apparent suicide may have been an adequate salve to anyone with stalker tendencies.The USS Indianapolis and its crew deserve to be remembered for their contribution to the war effort before it was bombed by the Japanese - they were sweethearts - that's what their war record shows.  They didn't deserve to suffer.",4,absolutely unbearable and unfair - American soldiers did not deserve this,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,2035,"['1', 'big', 'difference', 'suffering', 'warmongers', 'opponents', 'torn', 'ordinary', 'civilian', 'nightmare', 'spiral', 'NOT', 'own', 'making', 'suffering', 'crew', 'endured', 'unimaginable', 'absolutely', 'unfair', 'frankly', 'are', 'go', 'war', 'again', 'Whale', 'Warriors', 'are', 'danger', 'getting', 'attacked', 'sunk', 'sea', 'should', 'have', 'cleared', 'oceans', 'shark', 'life.2', 'Public', 'opinion', 'absolutely', 'must', 'be', 'ignored', 'example', 'McVay', 'treatment', 'only', 'posthumous', 'clearance', 'understand', 'injustice', 'one', 'lifetime', 'just', 'IS', 'Public', 'opinion', 'however', 'undeserved', 'may', 'be', 'intentionally', 'designed', 'person', 'just', 'have', 'deal', 'disagree', 'McVay', 'suicide', 'given', 'unbelievable', 'suffering', 'crew', 'many', 'whom', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'surivive', 'Suicide', 'disrespectful.I', 'think', 'casting', 'character', 'actors', 'not', 'necessarily', 'likeable', 'pleasant', 'was', 'intentional', 'were', 'fellow', 'civilians', 'December', '7', '1941.We', 'should', 'have', 'gps', 'implants', 'one', 'castaway', 'POW.The', 'USS', 'Indianapolis', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'most', 'remembered', 'plight', 'crew', 'sinking', 'According', 'wikipedia', 'entry', 'USS', 'Indianapolis', 'was', 'always', 'hunting', 'Japanese', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'always', 'protecting', 'soldiers', 'Pacific', 'often', 'engaging', 'Japanese', 'ships', 'aircraft', 'so', 'enemy', 'would', 'have', 'marked', 'USS', 'Indianapolis', 'especially', 'defeat', 'learning', 'ship', 'delivered', 'uranium', 'Litte', 'Boy', 'A', 'petty', 'vindictive', 'loser', 'would', 'hunt', 'down', 'crew', 'related', 'atomic', 'bombings', 'highly', 'publicized', 'injustice', 'McVay', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'adequate', 'salve', 'anyone', 'stalker', 'tendencies.The', 'USS', 'Indianapolis', 'crew', 'deserve', 'be', 'remembered', 'contribution', 'war', 'effort', 'was', 'bombed', 'Japanese', 'were', 'sweethearts', 'what', 'war', 'record', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'suffer']",Mission of the Shark VHS
438008,A3EDIPCXT15C3T,6304861672,Honey Solomon,"[0, 0]","For those who are familiar with the sinking of the Indianapolis and the subsequent court marshal of Captain Charles B. McVay, III , this is a reasonably accurate portrayal. For those who don't know, this is a good place to start. Well presented drama with a good supporting cast.A simple summary: The Indianapolis delivered integral components of the atomic bomb to Tinian and was bound for Okinawa when she was sunk by a Japanese submarine. This incident caused the greatest loss of men in US Naval history. It also suffered the most shark attacks reported. Families of those who died considered McVay responsible . . . the Navy needed a scapegoat and McVay was convicted of &#34;hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag.&#34;  Mochitsura Hashimoto (commander of the Japanese sub), testified that 'failing to zigzag' was irrelevant.  Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz remitted McVay's sentence and restored him to active duty. The rest of this story remains a part of Naval history. In October 2000, the United States Congress passed a resolution that Captain McVay's record should state that &#34;he is exonerated for the loss of Indianapolis.&#34; Too late . . .Recommended for those with an interest in WWII Naval History and for those who want to learn.

I was impressed with the attention to detail that the producers paid in the movie.  For example, it is known that the ship's doctor burned his hands to the point of uselessness while trying to open a door, and sure enough, this scene was excellently covered in the movie.  Stacy Keach stars as Captain Charles McVay, and he does an excellent job throughout the film.  Richard Thomas portrays the ship's doctor.  The scenes of the sinking and the subsequent struggle to survive on the sea is vividly portrayed.  I was also impressed with the attention payed to the rescue and Captain McVay's court martial.  In fact, this movie does a better job of covering the court martial phase than many of the books I've read on this subject.
