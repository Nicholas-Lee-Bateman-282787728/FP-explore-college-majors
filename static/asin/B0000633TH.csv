She is afraid of the dark, and bars herself in every night with multiple locks. But she has a good job, a fiancee, and is getting on with life, in some ways. Until Hirokawa, the childhood friend who lured her into the assault turns up on her doorstep. You would think that she would fight, flee, kill him. But, no, she lets him in, lets him stay--her old sense of helplessness rises with a vengeance, rendering her powerless. It is only a matter of time, though, until the new, damaged Chihiro takes over again.

693025,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0000633TH,Jeffrey Leach,"[7, 7]","The recent importation of massive numbers of Asian horror titles has kept me busier than a one armed paper hanger. Takashi Miike's voluminous catalogue of films alone--he often makes three or four a year--is usually enough to satiate my hunger for these movies, but when I tire of ""Audition,"" ""Dead or Alive,"" and ""Visitor Q"" I cast my eyes deeper into the Far East. I can always spend time with the increasing numbers of Korean films, like ""The Isle,"" or even start trying to keep tabs on the latest entries from Thailand. Then there are the Hong Kong Category III shockers, ""The Untold Story"" and ""Ebola Syndrome"" to name just two. These latter films are usually so disgusting that I have to spend a few weeks washing my palate out with sub par American slasher knockoffs just to recover from the general nastiness. Recently I've been on an Asian kick again, so I guess it's time to churn out a review or two. Takashi Ishii's ""Freeze Me"" seems as good a place to start as any. It's a movie from the Land of the Rising Sun that is more at home with a Charles Bronson ""Death Wish"" picture than a slasher or gore flick.Yep, what we've got here is a good old-fashioned revenge film, but with greater depth than you would suspect. The film begins by introducing us to a beautiful young woman named Chihiro (Harumi Inoue), a gal with a good job, a nice if quite small apartment, and a caring boyfriend named Nogami (Shunsuke Matsuoka). Our buxom heroine, unfortunately, harbors a horrific secret that is about to come back and bite her in the you know what. Out of the blue, she happens to catch a glimpse of a decidedly unwelcome presence hanging around her mailbox in the apartment building, a guy she knew roughly five years before back in her home town. Through flashbacks, rather cringe inducing flashbacks at that, we come to learn exactly why Chihiro fled from her childhood digs and headed for the bright lights of Tokyo. The chap leering at her from her mailbox, along with a couple of pals, assaulted our young gal in a particularly heinous manner on a cold, snowy day. Moreover, these thugs videotaped the festivities and promptly sold copies through the mail. Now five years later the nightmare returns. All three men will eventually show up at Chihiro's apartment to relive old memories.The three thugs--Kojima (Shingo Tsurumi), Hirokawa (Kazuki Kitamura), and Baba (Naoto Takenaka)--simply don't worry about Chihiro calling the cops or seeking other assistance. They seem to expect that her fear of being exposed to her boyfriend, whom she didn't tell about the assault, as well as concern for her general reputation should the videotapes reemerge will keep her quiet. They are correct. Chihiro goes to great lengths to keep this secret, mainly by making sure her boyfriend will not come back to the apartment. And the secret is kept to the great detriment of her tormentors. You see, they made the mistake of showing up at her lodgings one by one instead of as a group. This allows Chihiro to kill each of them in grotesque ways (a knife in the shower or a hammer to the head while a tormentor plays a videogame work equally well, it turns out), but the murders present a big problem. What to do with the bodies? She can't very well carry them through the streets of Tokyo. The solution involves ordering a big freezer, placing a body into the contraption, and then using it as a piece of furniture. A problem with the electrical system ultimately leads to a rather malodorous defrosting difficulty and a problematic choice for our heroine. ""Freeze Me"" is indeed a nasty bit of work.Ishii's picture is a beautiful piece despite the rather nauseating subject matter. The cinematography works wonders considering nearly all of the action takes place in an extremely tiny apartment, the performances are good for what is essentially an exploitation film, and actress Harumi Inoue is a real beauty who has little objection to prancing about in her birthday suit. More important, however, are the numerous layers to the film. Coldness plays a big role, both metaphorically and literally. The attack took place on an extremely cold winter day, and the memory of the assault has doubtless frozen itself into Chihiro's memory. In some way, that horrific day placed a coldness in our heroine's heart that can only find expression in returning the favor to Hirokawa, Kojima, and Baba. It's no mistake that she chose to put them in freezers; it's merely her way of turning the attack back on her tormentors in a poetic justice sort of way. Of course, I could be reading far more into the film than is actually there. Perhaps ""Freeze Me"" is nothing more than a mindless exploitation film reveling in images of graphic violence and excessive nakedness. Why not? There will always be an audience for such fare in films, especially when they come from Asia. Filmmakers over in those parts have no qualms about showing things that would never pass the MPAA.Supplements on the DVD are sparse, limited to a few trailers for other Asian features and a director's biography. Oh well. The film is wacky enough to hold your attention without a bunch of extras muddying up the waters. If you're a fan of films like the ""Death Wish"" series, any of the Dirty Harry flicks, Meir Zarchi's ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" or Abel Ferrara's ""Ms. 45,"" you'll want to pick up a copy of Takashi Ishii's ""Freeze Me."" It's a bit deeper than the average American revenge film, at least in my opinion, and the movie will help fill out your collection of films in this important cinematic subgenre.",4,"""How beautiful it

693026,A1LR0H445JZ8VO,B0000633TH,Jerry A. Pope,"[0, 0]","Gang-raped five years previously, cute and plucky Chihiro had managed to overcome the trauma of that event and put her life back together.  She got a good job, even got a boyfriend.  But then her past reared its ugly head.  The three gangbangers decided to celebrate one's release from prison by calling on Chihiro.  The first one showed up alone-which turned out to be a big mistake.  He pushed his way through her apartment door, raped her, and proceeded to once again ruin her life.  He showed up at her job and started a big fight.  He chased off her boyfriend.  This storyline reminded me of ""I Spit On Your Grave"", with much less gore though.  Sorry, this was not your typical Japanese bloodfest.  No, this one was all about revenge, and the personal price the girl had to pay.  There was little to no suspense here, same with the gore.  Not very much was revealed about the characters.  And as for the sets, much of the story took place inside Chihiro's apartment.  Ironic vengeance was what drove this story.  The woman took back her life, at the cost of her heart and soul.  I liked the ending.  We don't know if she jumped from the terrace, or if she escaped to Europe.  And that's ok.  Either way the story of her being abused by those sex maniacs-including her boyfriend-ended on that terrace.  Freezing the rapist's dead bodies was a wonderful means of poetic justice.  All in all I thought this was a good film.  It's in a genre by itself.  It's not horror, nor mystery, and certainly not action.  It is what it is, an enjoyable and intriguing look at one woman's fall into insanity, and the desperate measures the cruelty of humanity can drive us to.",4,"Brrrrrr, it's cold in here!",1099440000,"11 3, 2004",2004,1665,"['Gang-raped', 'five', 'years', 'previously', 'cute', 'plucky', 'Chihiro', 'had', 'managed', 'overcome', 'trauma', 'event', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'got', 'good', 'job', 'even', 'got', 'boyfriend', 'then', 'past', 'reared', 'ugly', 'head', 'three', 'gangbangers', 'decided', 'celebrate', 'one', 'release', 'prison', 'calling', 'Chihiro', 'first', 'one', 'showed', 'alone-which', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'big', 'mistake', 'pushed', 'way', 'apartment', 'door', 'raped', 'proceeded', 'once', 'again', 'ruin', 'life', 'showed', 'up', 'job', 'started', 'big', 'fight', 'chased', 'off', 'boyfriend', 'storyline', 'reminded', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'much', 'less', 'gore', 'Sorry', 'was', 'not', 'typical', 'Japanese', 'bloodfest', 'No', 'one', 'was', 'revenge', 'personal', 'price', 'girl', 'had', 'pay', 'was', 'little', 'suspense', 'here', 'same', 'gore', 'Not', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'revealed', 'characters', 'sets', 'much', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'Chihiro', 'apartment', 'Ironic', 'vengeance', 'was', 'what', 'drove', 'story', 'woman', 'took', 'back', 'life', 'cost', 'heart', 'soul', 'liked', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'jumped', 'terrace', 'escaped', 'Europe', 'ok', 'way', 'story', 'being', 'abused', 'sex', 'maniacs-including', 'boyfriend-ended', 'terrace', 'Freezing', 'rapist', 'dead', 'bodies', 'was', 'wonderful', 'means', 'poetic', 'justice', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'genre', 'not', 'horror', 'mystery', 'certainly', 'not', 'action', 'what', 'enjoyable', 'intriguing', 'look', 'one', 'woman', 'fall', 'insanity', 'desperate', 'measures', 'cruelty', 'humanity', 'can', 'drive']",N/A

All revenge tales, from ""I Spit on Your Grave"" to ""Kill Bill,"" share a common plot; Person is wronged, person wrongs back.  ""Freeze me"" takes this familiar story and frames it in an uncomfortably realistic scenario of modern Japan.  The stigmatism of being raped can be so strong that the majority of occurrences go unreported, but are simply buried away as a shameful secret. While this may seem unthinkable to many viewers it is a harsh truth.The story unfolds in a fairly predictable way.  It is a revenge film after all.  However, there is no joy in Chihiro's vengeance on her attackers.  She is a destroyed character, wronged beyond the point of experiencing any relief or possessing any strength.  Even dead, her violators continue to haunt her, as she keeps their bodies in industrial freezers in her apartment, unsure of how to dispose of her evidence.Ishii keeps the camera work tight, intimate and uncomfortable.  We are brought closer into Chihiro's world than we would want to experience.  The viewer is trapped into the same tight space. The colors are muted, with the frosty blue tint of the frozen corpses being the most colorful thing in the film. The lovely Inoue Harumi, who plays Chihiro, is nude for much of the film, but her nakedness emphasizes her vulnerability rather than offering the viewer any pleasure.One of the strangest and most unexpected elements of ""Freeze Me"" is seeing Takenaka Naoto, who is so likeable as Butterfly Joe in ""Ping Pong"" and The Dolphin Trainer in ""Waterboys,"" playing such a despicable character as lead rapist Baba.  It is good to see his range as an actor.The main weakness of this film is that it is a revenge film, and thus familiar enough to be predictable.  It does not improve up the basic plot stylistically in the way that ""Kill Bill"" does, not does it bend the boundaries of shocking violence such as ""I Spit on Your Grave.""  It does do a good job of presenting a capable genre flick.  Definitely worth a viewing, but not something that will rock your world like ""Audition.""",4,Revenge is a dish best served...,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,2178,"['Cold', 'what', 'get', 'Freeze', 'revenge', 'tale', 'directed', 'Ishii', 'Takashi', 'writer', 'infamous', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Trap', 'revenge', 'tales', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'share', 'common', 'plot', 'Person', 'wronged', 'person', 'wrongs', 'back', 'familiar', 'story', 'uncomfortably', 'realistic', 'scenario', 'modern', 'Japan', 'stigmatism', 'being', 'raped', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'strong', 'majority', 'occurrences', 'go', 'unreported', 'are', 'simply', 'buried', 'away', 'shameful', 'secret', 'may', 'seem', 'unthinkable', 'many', 'viewers', 'harsh', 'truth.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'way', 'revenge', 'film', 'However', 'joy', 'Chihiro', 'vengeance', 'attackers', 'destroyed', 'character', 'wronged', 'point', 'experiencing', 'relief', 'possessing', 'strength', 'Even', 'dead', 'violators', 'continue', 'haunt', 'bodies', 'industrial', 'freezers', 'apartment', 'unsure', 'how', 'dispose', 'evidence.Ishii', 'camera', 'work', 'tight', 'intimate', 'uncomfortable', 'are', 'brought', 'closer', 'Chihiro', 'world', 'would', 'want', 'experience', 'viewer', 'trapped', 'same', 'tight', 'space', 'colors', 'are', 'muted', 'frosty', 'blue', 'tint', 'frozen', 'corpses', 'being', 'most', 'colorful', 'thing', 'film', 'lovely', 'Inoue', 'Harumi', 'who', 'Chihiro', 'nude', 'much', 'film', 'nakedness', 'vulnerability', 'rather', 'offering', 'viewer', 'pleasure.One', 'strangest', 'most', 'unexpected', 'elements', 'Freeze', 'Me', 'seeing', 'Takenaka', 'Naoto', 'who', 'so', 'likeable', 'Butterfly', 'Joe', 'Ping', 'Pong', 'Dolphin', 'Trainer', 'Waterboys', 'playing', 'despicable', 'character', 'lead', 'rapist', 'Baba', 'good', 'see', 'range', 'actor.The', 'main', 'weakness', 'film', 'revenge', 'film', 'thus', 'familiar', 'enough', 'be', 'predictable', 'not', 'improve', 'up', 'basic', 'plot', 'stylistically', 'way', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'not', 'bend', 'boundaries', 'shocking', 'violence', 'such', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'presenting', 'capable', 'genre', 'flick', 'Definitely', 'viewing', 'not', 'something', 'will', 'rock', 'world', 'Audition']",N/A
