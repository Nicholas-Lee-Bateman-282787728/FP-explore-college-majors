Watching it now, as a 35 year old, I still find it to be an entertaining science fiction film.  The acting is nothing special and the lead character (David) can be annoying at time, as is Pee Wee Herman as the alien entity.  And even though the science (including space time travel) is theoretically possible, the movie is a bit far fetched at times.  However, it is a fun film that will capture your imagination, much like E.T.

324919,AXOZ5BWOEDL76,6302642256,Andrew C. Miller,"[2, 2]","Flight of the Navigator [Blu-ray] [1986] [UK Release] Flight of the Navigator is the action-packed classic 80s adventure into another world. It's 1978 and 12-year old David Freeman is knocked unconscious while playing. He wakes up and discovers it's now 1986 and he's been missing for eight years. NASA believes he's been abducted by aliens and want to use him for their research. But with the guidance of a strange unseen entity he discovers a hidden spaceship and with the help of MAX the computer sets off on an incredible mission to get back to the past where he belongs.Cast: Joey Cramer, Albie Whitaker, Paul Reubens (voice), Veronica Cartwright, Cliff DeYoung, Sarah Jessica Parker, Howard Hesseman, Matt Adler, Robert Small, Jonathan Sanger, Richard Liberty, Iris Acker and Raymond ForchionDirector: Randal KleiserProducers: Dimitri Villard and Robert WaldExecutive Producer: Jonathan SangerComposer: Alan SilvestriScreenplay: Michael Burton and Matt MacManusCinematography: Eric McGraw and James GlennonResolution: 1080pAspect Ratio: 1.77:1Audio: English: PCM 2.0Subtitles: English SDHRunning Time: 90 minutesRegion: All RegionsNumber of discs: 1Studio: Second Sight Films [Walt Disney Studios]Andrew&#8217;s Blu-ray Review - The astonishing success of Steven Spielberg's E.T. in 1982 heralded the money-making power of the friendly alien, so naturally every movie mogul wanted a piece of the pie. Independent producers PSO, known for more adult oriented fare, had some success with fantasy flick The Neverending Story so they pushed ahead with two cutesy sci-fi projects, one about a robot and the other about an alien. The former became Short Circuit and the latter became Flight of the Navigator. Unfortunately PSO encountered severe money troubles and the company was declared bankrupt before Flight of the Navigator was released, which is when Disney stepped in to pick up the pieces and distribute the film.Flight of the Navigator opens with a Frisbee Dog Contest on the Fourth of July, 1978. An ordinary 12-year-old boy named David Freeman (Joey Cramer) is there with his family. He's got a mother, a father, a pesky younger brother, and an unspectacular dog named Bruiser. That night, David goes to find his brother for the holiday celebrations. Wandering in the woods, he falls quite a distance into a ravine. When he gets up, it appears to be just a moment later. But, as he learns, it is actually eight years later. David hasn't changed in any way, but the rest of the world has.Now it's 1986. An old couple now lives in his house, his younger brother is now his older brother, and &#34;Starsky and Hutch&#34; is off the air! David has no knowledge of where he's been. It's a mystery that fascinated specialists are trying to unravel.Enter Dr. Faraday [Howard Hesseman], who makes it clear to David and his family that the top-of-the-line resources of NASA are the best shot at figuring out what has happened. So, David agrees to spend 48 hours at a NASA base, letting the best men in the field pry his mind in a search for answers. Simultaneously, Dr. Faraday and the other NASA specialists are mulling over the discovery of an unusual body which appears to be a spaceship. To reach a sufficient understanding, they decide that David will need to stay longer for tests.With the help of Carolyn McAdams [Sarah Jessica Parker], a friendly young intern at the base, David seeks to escape. His breakout quickly takes him to the spaceship, where he begins to make sense of the some of the strange dreams and voices he has been experiencing. The ship is commanded by a robot of higher intelligence [voiced by Paul Reubens], who David names Max. Max needs help from David, specifically his mind. David wants answers from Max and a departure from the curious scientists. They take off on a unique and thrilling journey through space and time.Flight of the Navigator is brilliant. All of its elements seem to work just right. It&#8217;s extremely clever premise is played to perfection, thanks to skillful crafting. The film starts out strong with a highly intriguing set-up, and sets a fast and flawless pace that it never departs from. In the lead role, Joey Cramer has just the right amount of curiosity and charisma to make the protagonist fully likable. Supporting performances from the family members all seem to hit the right notes. The robotic character, Max, is a lot of fun. Once he acquires some personality from a mind-mining procedure, he begins to sound quite a bit like Pee Wee Herman, in the best possible way. Though its script and direction deserve highest praise, a great sense of humor helps to distinguish Flight of the Navigator from other strong science fiction films of the late '70s and early '80s. While its time-travel tale is a serious one, it deftly uses comedy to enhance the adventure and crank up the entertainment value. In many of the best ways, the film calls to mind the perfect blend of Back to the Future, without feeling the least bit derivative.Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; Flight of the Navigator is presented in its original 1.85:1 widescreen aspect ratio, and has been enhanced for 16x9 televisions. The opening scenes of the film looked very grainy, but you needn't fear. This only reveals the technical shortcomings of optical credits sequences. There were a few brief scenes, either effects or exterior shots that exhibited an excess of grain. By and large, though, the video quality was overwhelmingly pleasing. Colours are vibrant and solid; flesh tones seemed extremely natural. Though not as sharp as a film from today, the picture was consistently clean and crisp. Without a doubt, this transfer offers significant improvement over any other home video release the film has received. Still, it's a revelation compared to the disastrous UK DVD which literally used a cropped VHS copy as its source.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; Flight's Dolby Surround 2.0 audio presentation was also most satisfactory. The film features a prominent and powerful score by Alan Silvestri (Back to the Future), which often comes in a bit louder than the rest of the audio, and effectively hits and underlines the film's adventure and suspense. Though the film's score was the most significant surround element, a number of the film's sound effects made use of the rear channels, as well. Dialogue was crisp and always intelligible. Aside from the inconsistent volume level (as usual, a desired effect), I didn't notice anything about the audio which detracted from the experience. A solid presentation, particularly for Dolby Surround, and Silvestri's memorable score is put to good use.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Audio Commentary with Director Randal Kleiser and Execitive Producer Jonathan Sanger: The solitary extra feature is an audio commentary featuring Randal Kleiser and Executive Producer Jonathan Sanger. The two have an obvious kinship and their chat features some interesting insights, although there's a fair amount of dead air so one sitting should be enough to take it all in.Finally, Flight of the Navigator is one of those rare nostalgic treats that's just as much fun as I remember it to be, and this Blu-ray presentation is sure to take you right back to 1986 and is a fantastic film that is well worth discovering, if you haven't already. The picture and sound have not been given an overhaul, yet the experience is purer for it. Extra features are limited to a decent commentary, but given the film's money troubles and mixed parentage, I couldn't have hoped for much more. While the complete lack of bonus features may not be what they had in mind, the presentation of the film itself deserves acclaim. Clever, suspenseful, and at times very funny, Flight of the Navigator simply offers as much fun as any movie I've seen in a long time. This film is one of Disney's best, one that widely departs from the studio's formulas or any conventions at all and manages to entertain without fail for an hour and a half and that is why it has gone in pride of place in my extensive Blu-ray Collection, as it is one of my all-time favourite ever since I originally owned it in the poor substitute DVD.

324946,ARNEUO7BF3J55,6302642256,E. David Swan,"[2, 3]","There is an interesting backstory behind this film. Filming was started by a company called Producers Sales Organization before PSO went bankrupt. The rights were then bought up but Disney who completed the filming. This could explain a lot because it's a film that has the feel of two competing visions. When I first saw this movie I was amazed at how deftly Disney handled the plot of a 12 year old boy who suddenly and unexplainably loses 8 years of his life without aging a single day. The acting is well done and the emotions feel real. As an adult I try to imagine losing my child for 8 years. The best I could ever hope for would be to have her back at the cost of losing 8 years of her life but in the case of the Freeman's they received what they could never have hoped for, their child returned at the exact age he disappeared. It's played very well with the parents so stunned and elated by David's return that they initially don't even question the fact that he hasn't grown any older. Unfortunately this isn't a film about a child adjusting to an 8 year absence this is a film about an alien spacecraft.It's when David finally enters the spacecraft, at just about the midway point that things suddenly go downhill. The exact moment where the movie goes from a fascinating movie for all ages to a little kids movie may be when Max (the spacecraft's AI) tells David ""You are THE NAVIGATOR!!!""  From that moment on the film completely loses its moorings. The interior design of the spacecraft is all reflective chrome and looks depressingly uncomfortable. Despite having nothing more than hard surfaces David isn't instantly killed when Max suddenly accelerates and decelerated the spacecraft. Even when I was young this seemed highly dubious. Max is an annoying thickheaded braggart and that's even BEFORE he moves into full Pee Wee Herman made. When you think things can't get any worse Max reveals a shipload of muppets. What's clear is that the first half of the movie, the GOOD half was just a setup for the second half. Ironically the ending essentially makes the second half of the movie pointless.I'm a big Pee Wee Herman fan from way back but there is a time a place for everything and for me using him as the voice of Max completely fails. The movie becomes obsessed with the, at the time, ground breaking reflective CGI of the spaceship but now it's just dull and repetitive seeing endless exterior shots of the spacecraft zooming around the Earth. At other times the FX are terrible as when David and Max hover over Tokyo which is nothing more than 3 asians badly green screened over a shot of an asian city. Supposedly the movie is going to be remade by Disney but I think it would be hard to recapture the things in the film that worked well. However, if I were to remake the movie I would push the spacecraft way to the back and focus on the relationship between David and his family and his adjustment to losing almost a decade while not aging in the least. Maybe show some of his friends now in their 20's. The spaceship is necessary to explain his lack of aging but in this film it just ground all the heart out of the story. If they insist on spending a significant amount of time in the spaceship at least make the interior look appealing.Flight of the Navigator averages 5 stars in it's Amazon reviews so clearly a lot of people see this as a flawless or near flawless movie. This COULD have been a great movie but as it stands I feel like shutting it off after the first 40 minutes.

The ones before we really understood how movies were made, and before we started to loose that magic touch of adolescence and didn't care how sappy or poorly acted films were, because well, we just didn't care. It didn't matter because films like this, 'Explorers', 'Neverending Story', 'D.A.R.Y.L.', 'Enemy Mine,' all seemed to be part of the USA Saturday morning routine, and for years I would always say in my minds eye, how they were my very favorite films as a child.Many state that films like Flight of the Navigator can't hold up to the test of time. That is such a boldly ignorant statement, at least for me. I watched it yesterday for the first time in a decade, and it was as touching and memorable as the first time I saw it. Joey Kramer, in his only leading role, before dropping off the face of the earth, carried the whole entire film in that Henry Thomas/Barrett Oliver way, and if Paul Reubens wasn't beyond brilliant as the voice of Max, the computer alien aboard the spacecraft, and how can you not love Veronica Cartwright, as the endearing mother, I mean honestly.Before the world became bills and deadlines, there were movies that shaped many girls and boys growing up in the eighties, and I for one can type with a smile that goes from cheek to cheek, how wonderful it was to have lived my childhood through films that truly touched at our hearts.

Pee Wee Herman (credited as Paul Mall, I couldn't tell you why, perhaps some cigarette promotion gone horribly wrong) is hilarious as Max, the spaceship's computer.  Bear in mind this was only a year away from Pee Wee's Big Adventure and ultra-stardom for Mr. Reubens and filmmaker Tim Burton.Faraday, played by Howard Hessmann, is the closest you'll get to a villain in this film.  He's a well meaning NASA chairman who does what he can in his capacity, thinking he's doing what's right for all involved.  In that process, he does the exact opposite.Great early appearances by future stars like Sarah Jessica Parker (who made a name for herself in Footloose, in a supporting capacity) and one of the first times the word ""downloading"" was ever used in a film.  It also features some of the first use of special effects ""morphing"" that are very similar to what was used in Terminator 2 five years later.Alan Silvestri, the music composer of Navigator, did the impossible during that time period:  Make an electronic score sound fantastic.  He loved using that Sinclavier keyboard all through the 80s in films like Delta Force and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  Then he graduated to real instruments and became one of the finest scorers in Hollywood today.Regarding the Blu-Ray itself, it's bare bones, with new commentary by director Randal Kleiser and co-executive producer Jonathan Sanger.  That's it. I don't really appreciate a two channel audio mix on a Blu-Ray disc.  That's like installing an 8-Track tape player in a Tesla Roadster.

Perkins ""wide reader""","[0, 0]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThe Walt Disney Company's ""Flight of the Navigator"" gladly wallows in its time period, even being set partly in the year it came out:  1986.  It has a Henry Thomas look-alike(for the time period) in star Joey Cramer.  It features Sarah Jessica Parker with a bad 'eighties era punk band hairdo.  Despite all of this, I like it a lot.It concerns David Freeman, a young boy who falls down a ravine in the year 1978 and wakes up eight years later in 1986.  Much of the fun and poignancy of the movie comes from David's reactions to the changes around him.  For instance, in 1978 David had a younger brother but in 1986 his younger brother becomes his older brother because David has not aged at all after having been mysteriously gone for eight years.  The creative team behind this movie achieves genuine suspense as David discovers what had been his home in 1978 is inhabited by an unknown older couple in 1986.  The secret of where David's been for his missing eight years drives the movie, first at a research facility and then on an entertaining spaceship ride.Also starring Howard Hesseman and featuring the voice of Paul Reubens working under the name Paul Mall, The Walt Disney Company's ""Flight of the Navigator"" remains entertaining fun.",4,"Cliched movie and guilty pleasure though it is, I still really enjoy it",1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,1258,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWThe', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Company', 'Flight', 'Navigator', 'gladly', 'time', 'period', 'even', 'being', 'set', 'partly', 'year', 'came', 'out', '1986', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'look-alike', 'time', 'period', 'star', 'Joey', 'Cramer', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'bad', ""'eighties"", 'era', 'punk', 'band', 'hairdo', 'like', 'lot.It', 'concerns', 'David', 'Freeman', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'down', 'ravine', 'year', '1978', 'wakes', 'up', 'eight', 'years', 'later', '1986', 'Much', 'fun', 'poignancy', 'movie', 'David', 'reactions', 'changes', 'instance', '1978', 'David', 'had', 'younger', 'brother', '1986', 'younger', 'brother', 'older', 'brother', 'David', 'not', 'aged', 'having', 'been', 'mysteriously', 'gone', 'eight', 'years', 'creative', 'team', 'movie', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'David', 'had', 'been', 'home', '1978', 'inhabited', 'unknown', 'older', 'couple', '1986', 'secret', 'where', 'David', 'been', 'missing', 'eight', 'years', 'movie', 'first', 'research', 'facility', 'then', 'entertaining', 'spaceship', 'ride.Also', 'starring', 'Howard', 'Hesseman', 'featuring', 'voice', 'Paul', 'Reubens', 'working', 'name', 'Paul', 'Mall', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Company', 'Flight', 'Navigator', 'entertaining', 'fun']",N/A

Directed by Randal Kleiser(The Blue Lagoon), the film stars a then-unknown Sarah Jessica Parker, Joey Cramer, Howard Hessman and Paul Reubens(Pee-Wee Herman)as the voice of Max. The story is about a 12 year old boy named Dave Freeman(Cramer), lving in Florida in 1978 and spending summer with his mom, dad, and little brother Jeff. One night, while running an errand, Dave found himself lost, only to find his family again-in 1986. The mystery of Dave's ageless appearance draws him to a special spaceship which gave him special navigation abilities. With it, Dave becomes the ship's pilot, with Max(Reubens), a super-smart and smartmouth robotic computer as his guide. Now with the ship and his newfound knowledge, Dave must return to his time and his regular family berfore NASA and the government retrieves the ship.

324971,A1KLNYFROE90OV,6302642256,Howard Tuttleman... howardtuttleman@howardtut...,"[1, 13]","Well friends, it's been-awhile since we've had a TRILOGY of reviews, hasn't it?  Today I've got a great-one in store for you.  I just had a movie-marathon and I'm going to bring my thought-dream to you now.type...type...type...Let's RE-VIEW!I think I saw this movie a looooong time ago when I was very little.  It didn't quite have an impact on me then, like it does now.  I probably related a lot to the kid and his dog at the beginning of the movie, where he's training his dog to be an e-lite frisbee catching machine.  At least, you think he's training the kid to catch frisbees, really he's (most likely) training the dog to catch daggers, or throwing stars, or bricks.  Things that could be thrown at them while him and his-dog are on secret missions in the future.What I never realised is that the boy-adventurer gets taken 8 years into the future.  He hasn't aged a bit, and his dumb parents don't even notice, they're just like ""HOWARD! (or whatever the kids name is) Where have you been!?"". Now that he is the same age and everyone else has grown up (including his dog-panion) he feels displaced and forms an even BETTER bond with his space-ship. The bond is FANTASTIC!  They have such a great time together.  Howar// I mean the boy-adventurer takes the space-ship to a farm and the ship teaches him about creatures from other planets that eat hats and the boy teaches the ship how to laugh and pee and the grown-ups just run around and yell and don't know what's going on just like in real-life.  The ship needs the boy because he has space charts in his head and the boy needs the ship because it takes him places.Unfortunately the space-ship eventually has to leave and go on other alone-missions and the boy doesn't understand.  He thought they were having such a good time and could go on adventures forever.Whatever, I didn't say I liked the near ending, but I give the writer credit for making it realistic.  All in all I gave the movie five stars for the boy-space-ship-bond, and then had to deduct 4 stars for not letting the boy and his ship-panion have a happy ending and go on other great adventures.  To be fair I'll add one star because when the boy is returned to his time, his-dog licks his face all over and then they play with fireworks, and that's how a good Howard Tuttleman-day ends.  Later.howardtuttleman.comP.S.I just tried to edit the review because it says I gave the movie five stars and it won't let me take-it-back.  I just want you to know that Howard Tuttleman has only rated the movie 2 stars.  Okay, maybe three now that I've had time to think-it-over, but NOT 5!

They release the dvd with no extras what so ever just so they can release a special edition a few months later. Disney did the same thing with Tron. I'm sure they have a lot of stuff they could've put on this dvd but they chose otherwise. I would've liked to see some trailers at least and it doesn't even look like it has any.Anyway  Flight of the Navigator is a great movie for the whole family. It's under-rated and a lot of people might not even have heard of it. It's about a boy who's accidently sent to the future by an alien space ship. When he finds his family they wonder why he hasn't aged a day. Scientists then run tests on him to find out where he was. He decides to escape and find a way back to the past and getting a ride on the space ship is the only way back. Once he gets on the ship is when the movie turns more goofy as the alien is voiced by Paul Reubens (Pee Herman) after all. The movie is still tons of fun and it does have some clever science fiction in it too for a kids movie.

Regaining consciousness, David returns to his house, thinking only afew minutes have passed, and instead of his parents and brother finds a lockeddoor and an elderly couple living there.Taken to the police station, David is identified by computer records as a boyreported missing eight years before. Despite the fact that he hasn't aged, he's takento the Freeman's at a different house nearby, and when he sees his parentsobviously older, he faints. He returns to consciousness again on a gurney on hisway to a hospital bed. A few minutes later, while his parents are called out of theroom by a somber-faced doctor, David is left alone with his brother Jeff -- who isnow 16.This is ostensibly a Disney movie for kids -- and later on there is a lot of comedicDisney hijinks -- but the first half hour of the movie, as David and his family dealwith the trauma of his time relocation, are some of the most heart-rending andchilling sequences I've seen in any film.Spoiler over.This movie reminded me of some of the time-relativity sequences in Robert A.Heinlein's novel, Time for the Stars. The characters are well written and the actorsdo an excellent job, particularly in the scenes between Joey Cramer and MattAdler, as 16-year-old Jeff. The distraught parents, Cliff de Young and VeronicaCartwright, are also excellent -- and Howard Hesseman and Sarah Jessica Parkerround out a great supporting cast.Special kudos are due to Paul Reubens (best known for his character Pee WeeHerman) who was originally credited under his own name for lending his voice to amajor character in this film, but had his name removed from the credits, replacedby the pseudonym &quot;Pall Mall,&quot; after Reubens was arrested for alleged indecentexposure committed in a movie theater seat. (I've never understood how Reubenswas convinced to plead &quot;no contest&quot; to the charge, after theater security camerasshowed him in the lobby buying popcorn at the time of the alleged offense.)Considering that Disney's Hollywood Pictures division released Powder, directedby a convicted and confessed child molester, Disney should show some backboneand restore Reubens real name to the credits.If you can get ahold of this movie, see it -- and maybe Disney will see fit to releaseit again -- on DVD, I hope.",5,Reminiscent of the best of the Heinlein young adult novels..,1022457600,"05 27, 2002",2002,2570,"['Flight', 'Navigator', 'far', 'better', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'right', 'suspect.Plot', 'spoiler', 'read', 'further', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', '12-year-old', 'David', 'Freeman', 'Joey', 'Cramer', 'anerrand', 'retrieve', '8-year-old', 'brother', 'Jeff', 'when', 'gulley', 'isknocked', 'out', 'Regaining', 'consciousness', 'David', 'house', 'thinking', 'only', 'afew', 'minutes', 'have', 'passed', 'instead', 'parents', 'brother', 'lockeddoor', 'elderly', 'couple', 'living', 'there.Taken', 'police', 'station', 'David', 'identified', 'computer', 'records', 'boyreported', 'missing', 'eight', 'years', 'before', 'fact', ""n't"", 'aged', 'Freeman', 'different', 'house', 'nearby', 'when', 'parentsobviously', 'older', 'consciousness', 'again', 'gurney', 'hisway', 'hospital', 'bed', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'parents', 'are', 'called', 'theroom', 'somber-faced', 'doctor', 'David', 'left', 'alone', 'brother', 'Jeff', 'who', 'isnow', '16.This', 'ostensibly', 'Disney', 'movie', 'kids', 'later', 'lot', 'comedicDisney', 'hijinks', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'David', 'family', 'trauma', 'time', 'relocation', 'are', 'most', 'heart-rending', 'andchilling', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film.Spoiler', 'over.This', 'movie', 'reminded', 'time-relativity', 'sequences', 'Robert', 'A.Heinlein', 'novel', 'Time', 'Stars', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'actorsdo', 'excellent', 'job', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'Joey', 'Cramer', 'MattAdler', '16-year-old', 'Jeff', 'distraught', 'parents', 'Cliff', 'de', 'Young', 'VeronicaCartwright', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'Howard', 'Hesseman', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parkerround', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast.Special', 'kudos', 'are', 'due', 'Paul', 'Reubens', 'best', 'known', 'character', 'Pee', 'WeeHerman', 'who', 'was', 'originally', 'credited', 'own', 'name', 'lending', 'voice', 'amajor', 'character', 'film', 'had', 'name', 'removed', 'credits', 'replacedby', 'pseudonym', 'quot', 'Pall', 'Mall', 'quot', 'Reubens', 'was', 'arrested', 'alleged', 'indecentexposure', 'committed', 'movie', 'theater', 'seat', ""'ve"", 'never', 'understood', 'how', 'Reubenswas', 'convinced', 'plead', 'quot', 'contest', 'quot', 'charge', 'theater', 'security', 'camerasshowed', 'lobby', 'buying', 'popcorn', 'time', 'alleged', 'offense', 'Considering', 'Disney', 'Hollywood', 'Pictures', 'division', 'released', 'Powder', 'convicted', 'confessed', 'child', 'molester', 'Disney', 'should', 'show', 'backboneand', 'restore', 'Reubens', 'real', 'name', 'credits.If', 'can', 'get', 'ahold', 'movie', 'see', 'maybe', 'Disney', 'will', 'see', 'fit', 'releaseit', 'again', 'DVD', 'hope']",N/A

The kids in the classroom cheered at the dogs catching frisbees and Alan Silvestri's intergalactic, energetic, synthesizer driven music score. This is a Norwegian production bought up by Walt Disney Pictures and it was directed by Randal Kleiser(Grease). In the 1980's, there was a mix of movies about aliens from outer space. The aliens in The Thing(1982) were hostile while E.T. in E.T. The Extra Terrestrial(1982) was benign. Flight of the Navigator flopped in 1986, but it found success on VCR's and TV. Joey Cramer played David Freeman, a boy living in Florida in 1978. He's kidnapped by aliens and dumped back on Earth in 1986. David is held captive in a NASA base and a UFO tries to help him get back home. Paul Reubens provided the voice of the robot ""Max"" under the name ""Paul Mall"". The first hour of Flight of the Navigator is a moody science fiction drama. The second hour turns into a funny, action packed family film. The film was packed with state of the art visual effects and early CGI. A young Sarah Jessica Parker plays an intern that befriends David.David's brother is bratty in 1978 and sensitive and caring in 1986. This film isn't perfect. There's a romantic subplot with David and a girl in 1978 that goes nowhere. This film was a hit on VHS and TV; Walt Disney Pictures was unable or unwilling to produce a sequel. There are rumors about a remake in the works. Flight of the Navigator is an underrated classic from the 1980's.",5,"FUN FUN FUN!

My boys enjoyed it very much as did my wife.As a Disney film it used the never worn out Disney theme of a family separated by circumstances beyond their control.  In this case the young hero of the movie is abducted by an alien spacecraft piloted by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) who sounded very familiar.  The abducted boy is missing for a period of years only to be returned to his family not a day older but eight years later.After a series of medical tests conducted at a local hospital to explain the mystery (which has the family as well as the police baffled), NASA steps in and ""borrows"" the boy for a few days of further testing trying to understand a recently recovered and very secret UFO.  This is when the movie really takes off and is extremely entertaining.When my family some years later visited Disneyworld we found on their back lot two beautiful full size UFO mockups used for the filming of this movie.

There were a few scenes that always scared the bejeebers out of my younger self, but despite that I quite enjoyed the flick.  A great deal of the plot went right over my head as a child, but the film captivated me nonetheless.  What child wouldn't want to go flying around in a shiny UFO, with a sentient robot and a gaggle of weirdly adorable aliens for company?Now that I'm older and have had a chance to rewatch the film, I understand more of the plot -- and while I wouldn't rank it as high as other classic sci-fi and fantasy films of the '80s such as ""Back to the Future"" and the aforementioned ""Never Ending Story,"" it's still a fun flick that can appeal to both kids and adults.It's the late '70s, and young David is mostly preoccupied with training his awkward dog to be a champion Frisbee catcher and avoiding his annoying little brother.  But late one night as he's searching for said annoying brother, he falls into a ravine... and wakes up eight years later to discover that everyone and everything except him has aged during those missing years.  When a group of scientists discovers that not only has he not aged, but his brain contains starmaps and schematics that make him an invaluable asset, they threaten to keep him indefinitely.  Understandably freaked out by this, David escapes, chances up on a UFO that was captured around the same time he woke up, and climbs aboard.  There he befriends the ship's logical but curious computer system, Max, and when he discovers Max is responsible for his predicament, he helps the UFO escape and tries to return home.The concept of this movie, while it's been done before in literature (think of it as a futuristic Rip Van Winkle), is fairly unique to film, which adds to this film's charm.  It has a realism and earnestness to it that most modern sci-fi films lack, partly due to the strong performances by the various actors but also due to the realism of the special effects.  With CGI technology not quite up to par yet, this film works best when it relies on puppetry and animatronics to bring its alien characters to life, and both Max and the alien specimens aboard his ship are all the more believable and impressive for it.If I have a nitpick with this movie, it's with Max.  Voiced by Paul Reuben, better known as Pee-Wee Herman, he works best when he's his usual logical yet curious self.  But partway through the film, thanks to an accidental mind-meld with David, he becomes pretty much a robotic Pee-Wee, cracking obnoxious jokes and speaking with an annoying nasal voice that's just a deeper version of Pee-Wee's.  It's not enough to make me hate the film, but it does get grating enough to knock it down a star.All in all, despite the dated CGI and obnoxious Pee-Wee impersonation, this is an underrated classic of the '80s, and worth a look for sci-fi fans young and old.

A boy leaves Earth unknowingly in 1978 and returns to his family eight years later when his perception is he was only gone for a few hours. He befriends an alien with a spaceship to devise a way to travel back to his own time. Oddly, this film often gets overlooked as many people haven't heard of it. It never seemed to get much promotion in the Disney library despite being a very good movie. It is perfect for the entire family (there is nothing objectionable about it except one or two curses). The story is interesting, the performances are good and the music is enjoyable. The special effects are also fairly good for its era. It hasn't lost any magic for me but teenagers may find some of the ideas cliche now. It is similar to ET but better (in my opinion). The plot has more substance then you might expect for its intended audience. My only complaint would be Pee Wee Herman as the alien's voice does get old after awhile but young kids will find it funny. A remake is in the works so a new generation of fans can appreciate the story. It has only one bonus feature (audio commentary by Director Randal Kleiser). Subtitles are English SDH only.This Blu-ray must be imported so ensure you have the appropriate equipment to play Region B/2 discs. Most US Blu-ray players can play discs from other regions (unlike US DVD players) but if you haven't purchased an imported Blu-ray before some people do have the occasional problem with them.

David also dreams of entering his pet dog in frisbee tournaments and getting the nerve to ask the girl next door out.  However, on the 4th of July in 1978, something unexpected occurs, and David finds that almost 8 years have passed!  His parents have aged, and so has his brother (who strangely does not use this oppurtunity to exact vengeance on his now &quot;younger brother&quot;).  Even stranger, NASA has secretly uncovered a flying saucer, and when they find that some strange brain patterns from David resemble the form of the spacecraft, they use the theory of why David hasn't aged in 8 years, and put him on NASA's base.  There, they find countless star charts logged into David's brain, and decide to keep DAvid on an extended stay.  ONe night, David hears a strange noise, and sneaks into a hanger, where he encounters the flying saucer.  He gains entry and is interfaced with the computer's intelligence: a strangerobotic eye that can talk and more.  Soon, the two are off, with an agreement for David to give the lifeform (the ship, nicknamed MAX by David) his star charts if he'll help David get home.A rather long summary, but a very good film.  One of the first major scores for Alan Silvestri after composing Back to the Future, &quot;Flight of the Navigator&quot; is filled with synthesized music and very eerie futuristic tones.  Also, given it's a Disney feature, it gets corny at times, notably when the ship has collected other life forms (though how he got them onto the ship is a mystery), mostly all puppets or wire-frame puppets.  The visual animation to make the ship works well, considering the years before digital technology and the establishment of major FX houses.The story is one that is made in the vein of simplicity, yet has some elements that would be welcome in most films today.

He wakes up only to find himself in the future. Also an alien spaceship needs to complete a brain scan of David (Cramer) to get his star charts and go home. The trouble is: NASA. David finds out something weird. His little brother Jeff is no longer littler and no longer younger than David. NASA wants to know where he was and what's the connection between him and the spaceship they have locked up in a hanger? As David is kept in NASA, many questions that are running thru his mind need to be answered. David and the Alien spaceship take him back home while NASA is hot on their trail.

Along with &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; and &quot;ET: the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, this was one of my favorite sci-fi films.  The concept of aliens and UFOs fascinated me.  Unfortunately, it seems to have fallen out of circulation.  Luckily I was able to get a copy of the VHS some time back.  I hope Disney will re-release this film on DVD so we can see it in its original widescreen aspect ratio.Joey Cramer is David Freeman, a boy living in a picture perfect Florida town in 1978 with his parents and bratty kid brother.  However, he finds his life changed when he is knocked out in the forest for a few minutes, or so he thinks.  When he returns home, he finds that it is 1986.  David has been missing for 8 years, yet David himself has not aged.  David's parents are now eight years older, and his bratty kid brother has grown up into a quite decent 16-year-old.  David's quest to find out what happened to him will take him to an alien spacecraft run by a computer named Max.The first half of the film is structured like an eerie mystery as David and the police try to piece together what happened to David.  This is perfectly complemented by Alan Silvestri's eerie score.  The film loses some of its mystery later on, but it's still highly enjoyable.  The spacecraft looks incredible, and the scenes where David gets to fly the spacecraft are really neat.  I think though I liked Max better before he assumed his Pee-Wee Herman voice (voiced by Pee-Wee himself).The ending nicely tied things up.  Too bad we don't get to see  what becomes of David's crush on the local girl.",4,Nostalgic Eighties Flick,1031011200,"09 3, 2002",2002,1676,"['have', 'nostalgic', 'memories', 'watching', 'film', 'kid', 'eightees', 'quot', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'quot', 'quot', 'Extra-Terrestrial', 'quot', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'concept', 'aliens', 'UFOs', 'fascinated', 'Unfortunately', 'have', 'fallen', 'circulation', 'Luckily', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'copy', 'VHS', 'time', 'back', 'hope', 'Disney', 'will', 're-release', 'film', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'original', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio.Joey', 'Cramer', 'David', 'Freeman', 'boy', 'living', 'picture', 'perfect', 'Florida', 'town', '1978', 'parents', 'bratty', 'kid', 'brother', 'However', 'life', 'changed', 'when', 'knocked', 'out', 'forest', 'few', 'minutes', 'so', 'When', 'home', '1986', 'David', 'been', 'missing', '8', 'years', 'yet', 'David', 'not', 'aged', 'David', 'parents', 'are', 'now', 'eight', 'years', 'older', 'bratty', 'kid', 'brother', 'grown', 'up', 'quite', 'decent', '16-year-old', 'David', 'quest', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'will', 'take', 'alien', 'spacecraft', 'run', 'computer', 'named', 'Max.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'structured', 'eerie', 'mystery', 'David', 'police', 'try', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'happened', 'David', 'perfectly', 'complemented', 'Alan', 'Silvestri', 'eerie', 'score', 'film', 'mystery', 'later', 'still', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'spacecraft', 'incredible', 'scenes', 'where', 'David', 'fly', 'spacecraft', 'are', 'really', 'neat', 'think', 'liked', 'Max', 'better', 'assumed', 'Pee-Wee', 'Herman', 'voice', 'voiced', 'Pee-Wee', '.The', 'ending', 'nicely', 'tied', 'things', 'up', 'Too', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'what', 'David', 'crush', 'local', 'girl']",N/A

The basic plotline is this: David Freeman, a typical 12-year-old from 1978, is rendered unconcious in an accident. When he wakes up, he finds that he has somehow been transported to 1986 without aging at all. A spaceship who's mission is to study different races throughout the universe turns out to be the culprit, and the two embark on a journey to get David home.The movie is charming and funny, with knock-your-socks-off music provided by Alan Silvestri. It's a film for fans of Disney and/or the '80s. It's been a family favorite for us for as long as I can remember. Only caution: almost every swear word in the book is used once in the movie. I realize that doesn't faze most people nowadays, but I still feel obligated to mention it.The fact that Disney plans to remake this is sacreligious.
