So strong is this desire that six-year-old Russian, Vanya (Kolya Spiradonov) is reluctant to be adopted by potential Italian foster parents visiting his orphanage.  With envy coming from every child and great pressure from the Madam and other directors, his inquest seems daunting at best from the start.  Still, one night at a bus stop, he meets into a woman who grieves over giving up her son, forced by poverty and financial pressures society place upon her.  Once he can see her vodka induced tears, he wonders if he, too, has a real mother crying for him somewhere.  With an approximate 5,000 Euros on his head for the institution, he stubbornly hits the trail for a quest for his true identity.`The Italian,' a Russian import, works so well because the boy's actions seem so real.  His nave bewilderment goes along with the simple ways in which he follows his investigation.  Besides naturally unfolding the frigid climate and the rough existence before our eyes--even of post-Communist Russia--the story targets our heartstrings with a lovable, young protagonist who truly has had enough hard knocks to already have street smarts in his small, mean life.  The acting is so laudably casual that we really feel like we're watching live scenes rather than a drama.  'The Italian' has the effect of melting the core Russian existence, whose human struggle is presented as not much different than their winter weather.  It's also good at melting our own hearts as well.",4,Once in a Lifetime,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,1576,"['heart', 'orphan', 'life', 'shroud', 'mystery', 'concerning', 'one', 'biological', 'parents', 'So', 'strong', 'desire', 'six-year-old', 'Russian', 'Vanya', 'Kolya', 'Spiradonov', 'reluctant', 'be', 'adopted', 'potential', 'Italian', 'foster', 'parents', 'visiting', 'orphanage', 'envy', 'coming', 'child', 'great', 'pressure', 'Madam', 'other', 'directors', 'inquest', 'daunting', 'best', 'start', 'Still', 'one', 'night', 'bus', 'stop', 'woman', 'who', 'over', 'giving', 'up', 'son', 'forced', 'poverty', 'financial', 'pressures', 'society', 'place', 'can', 'see', 'vodka', 'induced', 'tears', 'too', 'real', 'mother', 'crying', 'somewhere', 'approximate', '5,000', 'Euros', 'head', 'institution', 'stubbornly', 'trail', 'quest', 'true', 'identity.', 'Italian', 'Russian', 'import', 'so', 'well', 'boy', 'actions', 'seem', 'so', 'real', 'nave', 'bewilderment', 'along', 'simple', 'ways', 'investigation', 'naturally', 'unfolding', 'frigid', 'climate', 'rough', 'existence', 'eyes', 'even', 'post-Communist', 'Russia', 'story', 'heartstrings', 'lovable', 'young', 'protagonist', 'who', 'truly', 'had', 'enough', 'hard', 'knocks', 'already', 'have', 'street', 'smarts', 'small', 'mean', 'life', 'acting', 'so', 'laudably', 'casual', 'really', 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'live', 'scenes', 'rather', 'drama', 'Italian', 'effect', 'melting', 'core', 'Russian', 'existence', 'human', 'struggle', 'presented', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'winter', 'weather', 'also', 'good', 'melting', 'own', 'hearts', 'well']",The Italian

Now, generally we are privy to orphanages that are understaffed, crowded, dirty, and filled with numb or crying babies.  But here, we have the older children, and young teens who aren't adoption material.  The conditions of the orphanage are like one might assume, squalid, cold, dreary, and a place where the young girls sell themselves, a youth gang, corrupt and greedy officials.A six-year old boy has been selected for the pending adoption to an Italian family.  The adoption is a dream come true, the choice of a lifetime, and they nickname him The Italian.  But the adorable child has a mission to accomplish, to see his biological mother.  It's here that he must scheme to leave the orphanage, travel by train, elude the staff who fears they will lose much money for the pending adoption.  Vanya sets out to find the home where his mother lives.  You can follow his journey, root for him, feel for the sweetness and innocence he has.  The film is fast-paced, lot of events happening, and very suspenseful.It's no surprise that children in foreign film can do some remarkable work, and this child was wonderful.  This was director Andrei Kravchuk feature film debut.  The film is based on a true story of a Russian boy abandoned in the orphanage and he goes in search of his mother.  The child, born in 1995, has starred in several movies.This is a bittersweet movie, observing the chilling depiction of a Russian orphanage, but it is not surprising.  But see this innocent child caught up between the dream of a lifetime or the choice of now.  ....Rizzo",5,The dream of a lifetime or the choice of now,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,1650,"['2007', 'Russian', 'film', 'place', '2002', 'main', 'setting', 'Russian', 'orphanage', 'Now', 'generally', 'are', 'privy', 'orphanages', 'are', 'understaffed', 'crowded', 'dirty', 'filled', 'numb', 'crying', 'babies', 'here', 'have', 'older', 'children', 'young', 'teens', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'adoption', 'material', 'conditions', 'orphanage', 'are', 'one', 'might', 'assume', 'squalid', 'cold', 'dreary', 'place', 'where', 'young', 'girls', 'sell', 'youth', 'gang', 'corrupt', 'greedy', 'officials.A', 'six-year', 'old', 'boy', 'been', 'selected', 'pending', 'adoption', 'Italian', 'family', 'adoption', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'choice', 'lifetime', 'nickname', 'Italian', 'adorable', 'child', 'mission', 'accomplish', 'see', 'biological', 'mother', 'here', 'must', 'scheme', 'leave', 'orphanage', 'travel', 'train', 'elude', 'staff', 'who', 'will', 'lose', 'much', 'money', 'pending', 'adoption', 'Vanya', 'out', 'find', 'home', 'where', 'mother', 'lives', 'can', 'follow', 'journey', 'root', 'feel', 'sweetness', 'innocence', 'film', 'fast-paced', 'lot', 'events', 'happening', 'very', 'suspenseful.It', 'surprise', 'children', 'foreign', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'remarkable', 'work', 'child', 'was', 'wonderful', 'was', 'director', 'Andrei', 'Kravchuk', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Russian', 'boy', 'abandoned', 'orphanage', 'search', 'mother', 'child', 'born', '1995', 'starred', 'several', 'movies.This', 'bittersweet', 'movie', 'observing', 'chilling', 'depiction', 'Russian', 'orphanage', 'not', 'surprising', 'see', 'innocent', 'child', 'caught', 'up', 'dream', 'lifetime', 'choice', 'now', '.Rizzo']",The Italian
1059785,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000NQRDZG,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I've wanted to see this movie for quite some time, for it encompasses two things I've very passionate about (that would be European film and the growing problems with child placement).  I finally had a chance to watch this movie last night, and I must say that it is truly moving.  There are so many heartwarming, as well as heartbreaking scenes within this film that will choke up even the sturdiest of manly men, for whose heart doesn't melt when peering into the eyes of a child?`Italianetz' tells the story of young Vanya Solntsev, merely six years old, who is living in an orphanage in Russia.  He is given the rare opportunity of adoption when an Italian couple comes to see him, falls in love with him (he is utterly adorable) and proposes to take him back to Italy with them.  He has a few months before the paperwork will be done, and in the meantime a desperate mother comes to the orphanage looking for her son.  Her son though, has already been adopted, and she is sent away empty handed.  This gets the wheels turning in young Vanya's head as he wonders what would happen if he goes away with this couple and his mother comes looking for him.  He wants to be with his biological mother so badly that he puts his safety in danger by running away to find her.  This causes uproar within the orphanage, for the Italian couple has already paid for Vanya.  This spurns a desperate search for his return, and this means that Vanya will have to work fast in order to find his mother before the Madam finds him.The film is gloriously moved along by some splendid performances and some even better cinematography that captures the gloomy air permeating the conditions these youths live in.  The scenes within the orphanage are marvelously constructed, and the interactions between the children and the staff are brilliantly portrayed.Young Kolya Spiridonov is wonderful as Vanya; giving him such natural concern and wonderment.  We can totally see this young mans yearning for answers, his desire to be reunited with his family.  Olga Shuvalova is also wonderful as Irka, the pretty young streetwalker who befriends Vanya and helps him the best she can in his quest for his mother.  Denis Moiseenko has the difficult job of playing a sympathetic villain, for he plays the leader of a small gang within the orphanage and he is responsible for disciplining young Vanya when his dreams of leaving the orphanage interfere with the lives of the other children.  His explanation to Vanya of his own home life is devastatingly moving and sincere.  Mariya Kuznetsova (who plays the Madam) delicately exposes the desperation that comes from poor living conditions and economic decline as her material needs cloud her judgment.What impressed me most about `Italianetz' was the masterful camera work and use of muted, yet rich colors.  Everything is dark and almost eerie, yet in a richly almost vibrant way.  Nothing seems gritty or gruff, but all the colors, as dark and ominous as they are, are polished and crisp.  This is especially effective in the opening scene where the Italians are guided through the fog by a mass of children.  This particular scene sets an early tone for the film.My only complaint here is that the films ultimate preposterousness tends to take away from the impact the film should have on someone.  It is a very moving and emotionally stirring film, but one cannot help but draw the conclusion that it is all far too saccharine to be remotely possible.  That's why I enjoyed the first half of the film so much more than the second half, for the interactions within the confines of the orphanage are marvelously real and raw, but once Vanya leaves his home to find his `home' the film takes a detour towards schmaltzville.  The final frame, in my opinion, dropped the film down a small notch, for it ending the film on a rather bland note.  Yes, it was sweet and sentimentally satisfying, but so unrealistic that I wanted to cry, because up until that point I had so much hope invested in this film; for I really thought it was going to be perfect.Should you see this movie?  Most definitely!  It is beautiful in many ways and ultimately unforgettable.  Could it have been better?  Most definitely!  It had a lot of potential to bear a more honest conclusion, given its blatantly honest beginning; but one cannot complain to heavily for `Italianetz' is still a very moving and touching film that will leave you very satisfied, if not even a little enlightened.",4,A beautiful depiction of ones desire to find his rightful home...,1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,4482,"[""'ve"", 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'quite', 'time', 'two', 'things', ""'ve"", 'very', 'passionate', 'would', 'be', 'European', 'film', 'growing', 'problems', 'child', 'placement', 'finally', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'must', 'say', 'truly', 'moving', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'heartwarming', 'as', 'well', 'heartbreaking', 'scenes', 'film', 'will', 'choke', 'up', 'even', 'sturdiest', 'manly', 'men', 'heart', ""n't"", 'melt', 'when', 'peering', 'eyes', 'child', 'Italianetz', 'story', 'young', 'Vanya', 'Solntsev', 'merely', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'who', 'living', 'orphanage', 'Russia', 'given', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'adoption', 'when', 'Italian', 'couple', 'see', 'love', 'utterly', 'adorable', 'take', 'back', 'Italy', 'few', 'months', 'paperwork', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'meantime', 'desperate', 'mother', 'orphanage', 'looking', 'son', 'son', 'already', 'been', 'adopted', 'sent', 'away', 'empty', 'handed', 'wheels', 'turning', 'young', 'Vanya', 'head', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'away', 'couple', 'mother', 'looking', 'be', 'biological', 'mother', 'so', 'badly', 'safety', 'danger', 'running', 'away', 'find', 'uproar', 'orphanage', 'Italian', 'couple', 'already', 'paid', 'Vanya', 'desperate', 'search', 'return', 'Vanya', 'will', 'have', 'work', 'fast', 'order', 'find', 'mother', 'Madam', 'him.The', 'film', 'gloriously', 'moved', 'along', 'splendid', 'performances', 'even', 'better', 'cinematography', 'gloomy', 'air', 'permeating', 'conditions', 'youths', 'live', 'scenes', 'orphanage', 'are', 'marvelously', 'constructed', 'interactions', 'children', 'staff', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed.Young', 'Kolya', 'Spiridonov', 'wonderful', 'Vanya', 'giving', 'such', 'natural', 'concern', 'wonderment', 'can', 'totally', 'see', 'young', 'mans', 'yearning', 'answers', 'desire', 'be', 'reunited', 'family', 'Olga', 'Shuvalova', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Irka', 'pretty', 'young', 'streetwalker', 'who', 'Vanya', 'best', 'can', 'quest', 'mother', 'Denis', 'Moiseenko', 'difficult', 'job', 'playing', 'sympathetic', 'villain', 'leader', 'small', 'gang', 'orphanage', 'responsible', 'disciplining', 'young', 'Vanya', 'when', 'dreams', 'leaving', 'orphanage', 'interfere', 'lives', 'other', 'children', 'explanation', 'Vanya', 'own', 'home', 'life', 'devastatingly', 'moving', 'sincere', 'Mariya', 'Kuznetsova', 'who', 'Madam', 'delicately', 'desperation', 'poor', 'living', 'conditions', 'economic', 'decline', 'material', 'cloud', 'judgment.What', 'impressed', 'most', 'Italianetz', 'was', 'masterful', 'camera', 'work', 'use', 'muted', 'yet', 'rich', 'colors', 'Everything', 'dark', 'almost', 'eerie', 'yet', 'richly', 'almost', 'vibrant', 'way', 'Nothing', 'gritty', 'gruff', 'colors', 'dark', 'ominous', 'are', 'are', 'polished', 'crisp', 'especially', 'effective', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'Italians', 'are', 'guided', 'fog', 'mass', 'children', 'particular', 'scene', 'sets', 'early', 'tone', 'film.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'here', 'films', 'ultimate', 'preposterousness', 'take', 'away', 'impact', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'someone', 'very', 'moving', 'emotionally', 'stirring', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'draw', 'conclusion', 'far', 'too', 'saccharine', 'be', 'remotely', 'possible', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'second', 'half', 'interactions', 'confines', 'orphanage', 'are', 'marvelously', 'real', 'raw', 'once', 'Vanya', 'home', 'find', 'home', 'film', 'detour', 'schmaltzville', 'final', 'frame', 'opinion', 'dropped', 'film', 'down', 'small', 'notch', 'ending', 'film', 'rather', 'bland', 'note', 'Yes', 'was', 'sweet', 'sentimentally', 'satisfying', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'wanted', 'cry', 'point', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'hope', 'invested', 'film', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'perfect.Should', 'see', 'movie', 'Most', 'definitely', 'beautiful', 'many', 'ways', 'ultimately', 'unforgettable', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Most', 'definitely', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'bear', 'more', 'honest', 'conclusion', 'given', 'blatantly', 'honest', 'beginning', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'complain', 'heavily', 'Italianetz', 'still', 'very', 'moving', 'touching', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'very', 'satisfied', 'not', 'even', 'little', 'enlightened']",The Italian
1059786,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000NQRDZG,Andy Orrock,"[1, 1]","""The Italian"" is an excellent film that goes onto my expanding list of Russian film recommendations.  Topping that list is stillThe Return- a masterpiece in every way - andBurnt by the Sun.  For those of you who know how good those films are, ""The Italian"" is near to, but not quite, in that class.We recently saw a movie at the ""AFI Dallas 08"" film festival that featured three young boys.  These three were likable, cute...and dreadful actors.  It was a painful viewing experience.  In ""The Italian,"" young Kolya Spiridonov - who portrays five-year-old 'Vanya' (he's 'The Italian' for reasons that will be apparent when you see the film) - is in nearly every scene.  The film sinks or swims with him.  Thankfully, he's simply marvelous.  Writer Andrei Romanov has given young Mr. Spiridonov natural, age-appropriate dialogue and director Andrei Kravchuk has coaxed a great performance from him.  It's not quite in the same class as then-seven-year-old Ivan Dobronravov's jaw-dropping performance in 'The Return,' but it's compelling stuff nevertheless.I was especially taken by director Kravchuk's technique of slyly showing the bleakness of the Russian countryside as a quiet backdrop to young Vanya's train ride.

One of the teen girl orphans is a prostitute, and again - not much reality here - she is never beaten or raped, she always has a good attitude toward life, etc.  The director gets the poor-orphan idea across in other ways; the older boys set up their own gang-like society in order to survive, including administering beatings to those who defy the rules, but also taking money from washing windshields, and prostitution proceeds, to buy much-needed items for the orphans, like shoes.

1059789,A2JWTJREIWLKN3,B000NQRDZG,Goat Lovin' Mama,"[61, 65]","As an adoptive parent of 2 Eastern European Children both in orphanages since birth, I found this movie to be a NEEDED movie to see for those who about to take the strange and unknown journey into International Adoption.  It was pretty strange to watch the movie and have the street of the orphanage Vanya was looking for being the same name of the street our daughter's orphanage was on.We had the rare opportunity of staying in the country we were adopting from for 31 days and lived in an apartment in the city, which was about 40 minutes from the Village our daughters came from.  We also were able to visit other orphanages and a TB Sanitarium with a Russian friend who regularly visits the children.We found the conditions portrayed in the movie to be accurate.  When I had to use the toilet, I was led to the ""guest toilet"".  It was an old decrpid shed  with a bucket.  The stench was so bad, I was willing to wait for a few more hours until we went back to our apartment.  Our daughters did not have that privelege.  Baths, once a week.  Clothing?  Old, dirty, holey, shoes too small, if at all, but big ole' smiles on all those little faces hoping that you will take them home.  Looks of hopelessness, sadness, despair, no future, no hope.  We sat and talk to a group of teens who wanted to know if they could come to America.  Tears streamed down their faces as we spoke to them and answered their questions. We brought sanitary napkins for the girls, toilet paper, shampoo, soap, laundry soap.  Many times they do without these basic things.  They have no running water.They eat sub standard food and many have permenant health problems because of it.Both of our daugthers were told they would be killed or sold.  They were terrified.  They were not told this by other kids.  They were told this by workers. This was portrayed in the movie.Our daughters were abused in the orphanages.  This was portrayed in the movie.(If you really want to see the reality, read the Human Rights Report on Orphan Neglect )THEN... the movie touches on the ""commodity"" issue.  Adoption is legal in Russia and Eastern Europe.  It takes HUGE amounts of frustrating paperwork and you come by invitation only.  The money changing hands is NOT to purchase a child, but to charge for services:  Paperwork translation, travel services etc.  But it would be naive to think that there are not those unscrupulous facilitators who make big money off of desperate people.There is HUGE corruption within the agencies that permit adoption.  Russia permits independent adoption without the use of an agency,  This waas portrayed in the movie.All the children want their mommies. They dream of having their mothers.  Vanya's desire to see his mother again is accurate.  I like the end, which I will not mention here.

The orphanages depicted in THE ITALIAN are not of the Charles Dickens' workhouse place types, but rather are homes run by kind people who encourage and support the children in a loving way.Vanya Solntsev (Kolya Spiridonov) is a six-year-old orphan who has just been selected for adoption by an Italian couple visiting his orphanage. At first happy about his 'good fortune', he soon encounters a distraught mother (Dariya Lesnikova) looking for her own abandoned son and Vanya longs to return to his own birth mother.  He is taught to read by a kind prostitute Irka (Olga Shuvalova) enabling him to search the orphanage files to discover the whereabouts of his birth mother. Much against the advice of his fellow orphans and those rowdy boys with whom he associates outside the orphanage, Vanya sets out to find his mother and in hot pursuit are the brokers for the adoption and the police. He hides, encounters all manner of obstacles and misfortunes on his journey, but at last he discovers his birth mother and the film ends with one of the more tender concepts imaginable.The cinematography by Aleksandr Burov is moody and captures the feeling of peril Vanya encounters.  In one of the more original musical scores for film Aleksandr Knaifel has elected to compose themes played solely on the high treble keys of the piano, on the xylophone and on bells: the feeling is one suggesting the small stature of the children, making their views the more important ones of the story. The cast is uniformly outstanding with special credit going to the warmth of the performance by young Kolya Spiridonov.  Recommended for all audiences.

The children there live in virtual squalor with no effort on the part of the leaders to properly instruct or educate them.  The future for most of these youngsters is a bleak one indeed, with a life of petty thievery and/or prostitution the most likely outcome for any of them not fortunate enough to catch the eye of some prospective, loving parent. Yet, as the movie begins, young Vanya's personal nightmare seems to be coming to an end as a kind Italian couple has come to Russia with the intention of adopting Vanya and taking him back to Italy with them.  However, before the proper papers can be signed, the boy, sensing he must act quickly before it is too late, sets off on a long, arduous journey to see if he can find the mother who abandoned him as a baby.""The Italian"" is a compelling slice-of-life drama that has a great deal to say not only about the appalling conditions faced by orphans in Russia today, but about the determination of the human spirit and the need for love that exists at the center of every human heart.  Director Andrei Kravchuk brings a near-documentary quality to the film, as he focuses his camera on the details of everyday life in the orphanage and the countryside through which Vanya travels.  This air of naturalism extends to the actors as well, particularly young Kolya Spiridonov, who, as Vanya, gives a performance that can only be termed extraordinary and heartbreaking.

1059800,A3P222CN9HAPTF,B000NQRDZG,"Steve Benner ""Stonegnome""","[3, 3]","This Russian film from 2005 marks Andrei Kravchuk's debut as a director.  It presents a powerful and poignant portrayal of modern-day existence in post-Communist provincial Russia.6-year old Vanya, played to perfection by Kolya Spiridonov, lives in a squalid, run-down orphanage. Adoption by affluent western couples offers the youngsters their only hope of avoiding the prospect of growing up into a life of poverty, petty crime and prostitution--as evidenced by an older generation of children who occupy the orphanage's boiler room and effectively run the place while the director drinks away the cash that comes his way from the steady sale of his charges. The largest proportion of the large adoption fees goes, of course, to the greedy and powerful adoption agent, ""Madam"", who uses the orphanage entirely for her own gain. Vanya appears to be fortunate when he is selected for adoption by an Italian couple; until he is brought to the realisation that once in Italy, with a new name, he will be lost forever to his real mother, if she is still alive and should she ever come looking for him.  Vanya's niggling doubts threaten the established order of things and so everyone, including the gang (or is that family?) of older children who missed out on his opportunity (as they see it), do their utmost to make him accept adoption as by far his best chance in life as well as the best for everyone else.  Vanya remains unconvinced.This bleak but at times uplifting film features an almost colourless world and it is some time before one realises that is not, in fact, shot in black and white at all but rather depicts a reality that is itself almost entirely devoid of colour.  The soft soundtrack score is just right also, adding to the overall mood in a gentle and understated way which, like the rest of the film, works a slow magic on the viewer. The story-line is well-paced and engrossing and all of the main characters are well fleshed-out too; even the toughest of them are (almost) all shown to have at least some human side which makes them all the more believable. The acting is never less than superb throughout. The only drawback that I found is that the dialogue is so rapid that one's attention is often perforce divided between visuals and subtitles to a greater extent than is really comfortable.This production shows that there is still much human decency to be found amongst the ordinary peoples of modern-day Russia, despite the impoverished conditions in which they live and the copious layers of corruption under which so much of their officialdom (or what substitutes for it) operates.  The film is no easy ride by any means but nevertheless is one I recommended you try.

In Russia, and much of eastern Europe, such places are over-flowing with scores of unwanted and abandoned children. In these places, they are frequently abused, neglected, and exploited. Education opportunites are gravely lacking in these facilities. In fact, they lack most of the basic necessities of day to day living. All this is portrayed in this outstanding film.Vanya, a brave and innocent soul, has misgivings about his impending adoption by a wealthy Italian family. He learns that his real mother still lives in the city where he was born. Exhibiting the Russian capacity for suffering and hardship, Vanya makes his way by train and foot across the decrepit urban landscape.

As the film begins, we meet Vanya who is to be adopted by a couple from Italy, whence comes his nickname ""the Italian."" We do not know if the couple is anxious to adopt a child, or whether they have other motives, but the adoption process seems more similar to a purchase than anything else. Vanya seems content with his lot until he sees the mother looking for her child. It turns out that it is the mother of a child who once lived at the same orphanage that has been adopted. Fearful that his own mother may one day return to find him, he decides to escape from the orphanage before the adoption takes place and search for her rather than be adopted by the Italian couple. His experiences make up the core of the film.Vanya's pluck is what keeps the film moving, but viewing the film is not without its emotional challenges. It is a stark film at best. While it shows the triumph of the human spirit, it also shows hardship and tragedy, beginning with the orphanage itself. It is a leftover relic of the Soviet Union, and that children are forced to live in such conditions is at best deplorable. We see the workers who may be profiting from arranging for ""adoptions,"" they are not one dimensional evil people. To some extent they do have the interests of the children somewhere in their hearts. For American viewers, it shows a world we'd hope could never exist, but know in fact does exist.For me,  both Vanya's innocence and intelligence makes the film compelling.

The first part of the story is set in a rundown orphanage situated in a small Russian village where one day an Italian couple arrives, looking for a child to adapt. The couple, who is kind and probably wealthy, decides to adapt a bullied boy Vanya, who, other children naturally consider, is very lucky.But the 6-year-old boy does not look so happy. Other children, the warden and the ""Madam"" all say he should be thankful for his luck, but Vanya disagrees because He knows his real mother may come back to him. And if she should fail to come, he should go out and find her before he leaves for Italy. While arrangements are being done, Vanya leaves the orphanage alone, believing that he can meet his mother again.""The Italian"" may remind you of the world of Charles Dickens - especially ""Oliver Twist"" though the entire film's tone is more somber and less comic. Like Dickens the innocence of the protagonist is sometimes overshadowed by the convincing portrayals of other supporting characters, all with fine performances. And like Dickens there is a social message about the conditions of modern-day Russia under the moving story of a determined boy, but the message never becomes preachy.Perhaps the film could have explored the meaning of Vanya's choice; or perhaps you will want to know more about other characters (especially the girl who helps Vanya).

When Vanya is told that he will be adopted by a loving couple from Italy, he becomes the envy of all the other orphans. He's excited himself to begin his new life, until the day the orphanage is paid a visit by another recently adopted orphan's mother. When Vanya has a conversation with the woman at a busstop, he feels his desire to find his own mother growing inside him.As Vanya sets out to find his mother, he must first learn to read, in order to read his own personal file and see if he can find any information there. Another orphan, a young prostitute (Olga Shuvalova) teaches him to read against the wishes of the older kids. Once Vanya finds the address of a previous orphanage he was in, he sets out on an adventure of self-discovery. The orphanage managers try to find Vanya, following him across the country, but he will not be deterred in finding out the truth about his own mother before he is adopted.The Italian is a film about the kindness, and unkindness, of strangers. The various people that Vanya meets along his journey reflect the different aspects of our society. Also, the point should be made, that adoption is not viewed in a negative light in this film. To the contrary, all the characters make it very clear that an orphan should feel very lucky to be adopted by a caring family. And the orphanage itself is shown as a sort of co-op where the older children take care of the younger children as miniature parental figures.Kolya Spiridonov turns in an amazingly strong performance for such a young actor, and he is really the foundation of the entire film, though the rest of the actors are solid as well. We get so few Russian films in the United States that the fact that this movie is for sale at all should tip off most viewers that it's probably a high-quality film.
