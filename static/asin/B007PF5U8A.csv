1535710,A1XMJ3CJWAPZDN,B007PF5U8A,Chris,"[2, 2]",This video shows how amazing and brilliant Larry Bird was to the game of basketball. It highlights how he had the uncanny ability to be 3 steps ahead of the other ball players and outsmart them to win games.  Great presentation and game highlights show how he is arguably the greatest all around basketball player ever to play.,5,Larry Bird video is Awesome!,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,327,"['video', 'how', 'amazing', 'brilliant', 'Larry', 'Bird', 'was', 'game', 'basketball', 'how', 'had', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'be', '3', 'steps', 'ahead', 'other', 'ball', 'players', 'outsmart', 'win', 'games', 'Great', 'presentation', 'game', 'highlights', 'show', 'how', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'basketball', 'player', 'ever', 'play']",Larry Bird: A Basketball Legend

It is narrated by Daniel Stern and has some great unseen footage, at least by me, of Bird at ISU and his early days with the Celtics. No complaints. Awesome.The games they included?Come on!If you are going to include a Portland game, include the 1985 game with the greatest buzzer beater ever. That game was awesome. It was epic. It was huge.I agree with his 60 point game. He was hitting all kinds of shots. It was great.I agree with the last quarter of the shootout with Wilkins.But no games against the Lakers or Sixers, which were his most epic and memorable? That's where they went off the rail with this set.",5,Some minor complaints,1340064000,"06 19, 2012",2012,703,"['documentary', 'outstanding', 'One', 'best', 'sports', 'documentaries', 'have', 'seen', 'narrated', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'great', 'unseen', 'footage', 'least', 'Bird', 'ISU', 'early', 'days', 'Celtics', 'complaints', 'Awesome.The', 'games', 'included', 'Come', 'are', 'going', 'include', 'Portland', 'game', 'include', '1985', 'game', 'greatest', 'buzzer', 'beater', 'ever', 'game', 'was', 'awesome', 'was', 'epic', 'was', 'huge.I', 'agree', '60', 'point', 'game', 'was', 'hitting', 'kinds', 'shots', 'was', 'great.I', 'agree', 'last', 'quarter', 'shootout', 'Wilkins.But', 'games', 'Lakers', 'Sixers', 'were', 'most', 'epic', 'memorable', 'where', 'went', 'rail', 'set']",Larry Bird: A Basketball Legend

And since I graduated from Indiana University, I was chagrined he signed, left, and then went to Indiana State Teachers College. I was never much of an NBA fan, yet when Larry and Magic rebuilt the NBA, I watched the Celtics until Bird retired.  He is just so great, it's hard to explain. And this video brings back his superb work ethic, and uncanny talents. Really happy I bought this DVD.

He is always interested in all things Larry Bird, not just because they are from the same town, but because Larry Bird is the type if person that other people look up to.
