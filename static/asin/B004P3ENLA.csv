The Hit List fails to take this rather compelling idea and turn it into a memorable experience. Instead, screenwriters Chad and Evan Law have created a very predictable thriller that runs low on suspense and follows a couple of characters noone really cares about. While the plot is graced with a tad of suspenseful action after Allan (Cole Hauser) finds out about the first murder, the film quickly turns into a banal cat-and-mouse game lacking variety. The chases get monotonous fast, and by the time the final showdown rolls around, all hope for improvement is lost. Even worse, the ridiculous ending of The Hit List is by far the most disappointing part. The Hit List looks decent on DVD, and the 1.78:1 widescreen transfer boasts a solid, sharp image with strong colors and adequate white and black levels. In terms of audio, the balance between sound effects and dialogue is occasionally off, though most of the film sounds all right.

1423317,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004P3ENLA,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","It's sad to see the career of a talented actor be knocked about by the folks in Hollywood. How many times have we seen an actor display great depth, many characters, work hard no matter what roles they were given and go so far as to receive Hollywood's highest accolade, the Oscar, only to disappear or find themselves in lesser films? Such has been the case with Cuba Gooding Jr.A talented actor who did fantastic jobs in high profile films like BOYS IN THE HOOD and RADIO, Gooding has been relegated to B movie releases of late. These are films that usually go straight to DVD with little or no promotion. But the truth is that even these films give us the chance to have a top notch actor in what some would call a lesser quality film. I disagree.THE HIT LIST stars Cole Hauser as Allan Campbell, a businessman with problems. In debt to a loan shark and depending on a promised promotion he finds himself passed over for someone else. Then he goes home to find his wife and best friend in the midst of an affair as she tells him that the life has gone out of their marriage since he seems consumed with the job. What to do? Hit the bar and start drinking.At the bar he hears on the news that a controversial TV announcer has been murdered. As he starts his binge, he begins a conversation with another guy at the bar named Jonas (Gooding) who isn't really interested in talking. But something that Allan says piques Jonas' interest and the two spend the night drinking. During this night Jonas reveals to Allan that he's the hit man who made the assassination in the news. Allan laughs it off but Jonas tells him to make a list of 5 names and he'll kill each one to prove it. Quite drunk now, Allan starts with the boss, guy who got the promotion, loan shark, best friend and his wife. A quick trip to the men's room and when he returns Jonas is gone.Waking in his car the next morning, Allan heads to work only to find once he gets there that his boss has been murdered. Squeaking past the police he tries to find his competitor only to witness him being killed by Jonas who then takes him captive. The rest of the film plays out with Jonas trying to force Allan to stop him from continuing on, to finally take a stand for himself. He also wants to find his own redemption for a life filled with murder.The plot runs fairly simple here and rather straight forward. So what makes it any different than any other B movie addition? First off is Gooding who does a great job here. He plays the role straight, a character who has done wrong and wants to pay but at the same time not in search of pity. He truly wants to be put down. Hauser is another B movie actor that deserves better. He might not shine as Gooding does here, but he does solid work. Lastly the thing that fares better than B movie average here is the soundtrack. This music sounds as if it comes from the latest blockbuster.Yes this film may be relegated to the B movie rack, it might not be a film that you've ever heard of but it does offer some pretty decent entertainment.

Allan goes home to find his wife sleeping with his best friend. Allan also has a shiner from making a bad bet and not being able to pay up. While guzzling JD at a bar he meets up with Jonas (Cuba Goodling) a Jose Cuervo man. Jonas tells Allan he is a hit man and has recently killed a conservative TV talking head. He asks Allen to make a list of 5 people he would want to have killed, and as his friend, Jonas will do it. Allen plays along, thinking this is good therapy, i.e. to make a list, but not really kill them. When Allen returns from the men's room, Jonas is gone with the list. By the time he gets to work the next day, his boss is dead.After the second person is killed we find out Jonas is terminal and has decided to do some free lance killing. During the movie Cuba talks in broad philosophical terms, while Allan wants to stop the insanity of all the killing. The movie is embarrassingly predictable. I don't recall Goodling having such a lame role. Clearly his acting abilities were wasted as his part was designed for someone who could read lines without having to feel them.

After talking to him Jonas says he can help Allan with his problems.  Thinking it's a joke Allan gives him the name of five people he wants dead.  When they begin to wind up dead Allan is the only one who can stop it.  After watching ""Sacrifice"" I was not expecting much from this movie.  This one, however, was very good.  Even with Cuba's movie choices lately being one step above Val Kilmer's, his acting is far better.  He does a good job playing a heartless killer on the verge of death himself.  Cole Hauser also does a really good job playing an everyman trying to correct his mistakes.  While there are many similarities to ""Collateral"" (and a hint of ""The Shootist""), this movie is not as good, but it's not a huge decline from that movie.  It is a pretty solid action, suspense movie that is well worth checking out.
