Looking at the names in the brackets, I just knew that Bo Jackson was that. Only that I wasn't sure if he would be beaten out by Michael Jordan through favoritism. I was surprised and shocked that Bo Jackson had beaten Michael Jordan for the title, so I knew he was a shoo-in to win it. That's how good he was, and I had seen him play football and baseball. In fact, I saw the All-Star game when he hit the lead-off home run. I've seen him run a for touchdown in a football game, where nobody could catch him. I saw the highlights of him which were daily occurrences on Sportscenter. His Nike commercials were famous and memorable. ""Bo Knows"" was the rage of the country. And I had the Beckett magazine of him in black and white. Of course, I would tell stories about the famous NES game called Tecmo Bowl and what was so special about it. I knew that he never lifted weights, and I knew he never needed to take steroids. He was the last superstar next to Deion Sanders to play baseball and football professionally, and he was that good in both sports. There will never be a Bo Jackson again. Watching ESPN Films: You Don't Know Bo relived the moments for me. I still remember him breaking a baseball bat over his knee to this day. So many times, I have really questioned it because I wasn't sure of my memory serving me right. All in all, Bo Jackson is the greatest athlete ever played.",5,"Yes, There Existed Bo Jackson.",1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,1492,"['Viewed', '3/13Rate', '5/53/13', 'Recently', 'ESPN', 'did', 'tournament', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'greatest', 'athlete', 'ever', 'Looking', 'names', 'brackets', 'just', 'knew', 'Bo', 'Jackson', 'was', 'Only', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'beaten', 'out', 'Michael', 'Jordan', 'favoritism', 'was', 'surprised', 'shocked', 'Bo', 'Jackson', 'had', 'beaten', 'Michael', 'Jordan', 'title', 'knew', 'was', 'shoo-in', 'win', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'had', 'seen', 'play', 'football', 'baseball', 'fact', 'saw', 'All-Star', 'game', 'when', 'hit', 'lead-off', 'home', 'run', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'run', 'touchdown', 'football', 'game', 'where', 'nobody', 'could', 'catch', 'saw', 'highlights', 'were', 'daily', 'occurrences', 'Sportscenter', 'Nike', 'commercials', 'were', 'famous', 'memorable', 'Bo', 'Knows', 'was', 'rage', 'country', 'had', 'Beckett', 'magazine', 'black', 'white', 'course', 'would', 'tell', 'stories', 'famous', 'NES', 'game', 'called', 'Tecmo', 'Bowl', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'special', 'knew', 'never', 'lifted', 'weights', 'knew', 'never', 'needed', 'take', 'steroids', 'was', 'last', 'superstar', 'Deion', 'Sanders', 'play', 'baseball', 'football', 'professionally', 'was', 'good', 'sports', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Bo', 'Jackson', 'again', 'Watching', 'ESPN', 'Films', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'Bo', 'relived', 'moments', 'still', 'remember', 'breaking', 'baseball', 'bat', 'knee', 'day', 'So', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'really', 'questioned', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'memory', 'serving', 'right', 'Bo', 'Jackson', 'greatest', 'athlete', 'ever', 'played']",ESPN Films:  You Don't Know Bo
