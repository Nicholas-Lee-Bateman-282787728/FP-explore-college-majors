His wife Lara (Joyce Hyser) is glad, and is planning a baby - until Matt tells her he wants a divorce, so he can pursue his interests - younger, prettier, & prefferably blonder women - as many as he can get. Until he meets Juliette (Nichole Hiltz) - who he falls in love with. But Juliette isn't what she seems. She's actually Tuesday - a girl Lara hired to break Matt's heart the same way he broke hers.The story line is full of logic flaws. How does a wife who doesn't know him well enough to realize he'd dump her the second he got his break manage to manipulate him into falling in love & marrying the woman she hired? Why does she wreck her best friend's marriage? Why don't those same friends warn Matt? And how could he miss all the clues to what's going on?I'm sure Stephan Jenkins' fans would rent or buy this movie just to see him on screen and swoon, no matter how bad the movie is (he's not that bad of an actor himself, based on his performace in 'Rock Star', so don't judge him on this movie - he had too much going against him as an amateur actor). As for the rest of us - I'm sure there are much better movies to watch out there.",2,"Deserves a lot less than 2 stars, but....",1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,1495,"['casts', 'something', 'efforts', 'deal', 'bad', 'script', 'full', 'cheesiest', 'lines', 'cliches', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'movie', 'low', 'quality', 'DVD', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'noticed', 'voices', 'lip', 'movements', 'were', ""n't"", 'always', 'sync', '.Matt', 'Kane', 'Stephan', 'Jenkins', 'interior', 'decorator', 'who', 'finally', 'got', 'big', 'break', 'wife', 'Lara', 'Joyce', 'Hyser', 'glad', 'planning', 'baby', 'Matt', 'divorce', 'can', 'pursue', 'interests', 'younger', 'prettier', 'prefferably', 'blonder', 'women', 'as', 'many', 'can', 'get', 'Juliette', 'Nichole', 'Hiltz', 'who', 'love', 'Juliette', ""n't"", 'what', 'actually', 'Tuesday', 'girl', 'Lara', 'hired', 'break', 'Matt', 'heart', 'same', 'way', 'broke', 'hers.The', 'story', 'line', 'full', 'logic', 'flaws', 'How', 'wife', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'well', 'enough', 'realize', ""'d"", 'dump', 'second', 'got', 'break', 'manage', 'manipulate', 'falling', 'love', 'marrying', 'woman', 'hired', 'Why', 'wreck', 'best', 'friend', 'marriage', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'same', 'friends', 'warn', 'Matt', 'how', 'could', 'miss', 'clues', 'what', 'going', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Stephan', 'Jenkins', 'fans', 'would', 'rent', 'buy', 'movie', 'just', 'see', 'screen', 'swoon', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'based', 'performace', ""'Rock"", 'Star', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'movie', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'amateur', 'actor', 'rest', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'movies', 'watch', 'out', 'there']",N/A

733596,A3MZU8A1ASX8X2,B0000844KK,"J. Sherman ""The Critic""","[1, 1]","I'm probably one of the few people (if not the only one) to have watched this movie more than once, but only because I couldn't finish it.  You could say that it's my favorite bad movie.  Self-assured Laura (Joyce Hyser) thought she had a good thing going with her struggling husband Matt (Stephen Jenkins).  But when Matt's career in interior design takes off, so does he-and to sleep around, no less.  Devastated, Laura hires a sultry con artist (Nicole Hiltz) to win Matt's heart, and then break it.  But Laura's partner in crime has her own plans.Where to begin?  Part of what makes even the worse revenge fantasies work is making the main antagonist look as nefarious as possible.  Jenkins' character earns sympathy points for at least being sensible enough to leave his wife and THEN sleep around, but also for being so naive that he thinks he and his ex can still be friends.  Hyser's scorned woman, who eventually humps her blindfolded ex halfway through the story, stops being the victim and becomes just as bad as those she harms.  ""Patently obvious"" overacting aside, you just get spoiled brats trying to one-up each other for their own indulgence-and they can't even do that right!  If there's any moral to be derived from this farce is that revenge is a sucker's game.This film is rated R: Adult Language, Adult Situations.",1,Cut From the Same Cloth,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,1336,"[""'m"", 'probably', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'only', 'could', ""n't"", 'finish', 'could', 'say', 'favorite', 'bad', 'movie', 'Self-assured', 'Laura', 'Joyce', 'Hyser', 'thought', 'had', 'good', 'thing', 'going', 'struggling', 'husband', 'Matt', 'Stephen', 'Jenkins', 'when', 'Matt', 'career', 'interior', 'design', 'off', 'so', 'he-and', 'sleep', 'less', 'Devastated', 'Laura', 'sultry', 'con', 'artist', 'Nicole', 'Hiltz', 'win', 'Matt', 'heart', 'then', 'break', 'Laura', 'partner', 'crime', 'own', 'plans.Where', 'begin', 'Part', 'what', 'even', 'worse', 'revenge', 'fantasies', 'work', 'making', 'main', 'antagonist', 'look', 'as', 'nefarious', 'possible', 'Jenkins', 'character', 'sympathy', 'points', 'least', 'being', 'sensible', 'enough', 'leave', 'wife', 'THEN', 'sleep', 'also', 'being', 'so', 'naive', 'ex', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'friends', 'Hyser', 'scorned', 'woman', 'who', 'eventually', 'blindfolded', 'ex', 'halfway', 'story', 'being', 'victim', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'Patently', 'obvious', 'overacting', 'aside', 'just', 'get', 'spoiled', 'brats', 'trying', 'one-up', 'other', 'own', 'indulgence-and', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'right', 'moral', 'be', 'derived', 'farce', 'revenge', 'sucker', 'game.This', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'Adult', 'Language', 'Adult', 'Situations']",N/A
733597,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0000844KK,Michael Butts,"[8, 8]","ART OF REVENGE ultimately fails because it gives us no one to actually root for.  We meet Matt Kane, a swooningly handsome young designer, who decides after 7 years of marriage he wants to have hot sex with lots of blondes.  We meet Lara Kane, his long-suffering wife, who stuck with him and supported him on his way to his international fame.  Matt's decision to divorce his wife comes after she's told him she wants to have a baby.  So once the split happens, Lara decides the best thing for her to do is to get revenge on her self-serving, egocentric ex.  She hires a voluptuous anti-social blonde to worm her way into Matt's life, get him to fall in love, marry him and then ruin his life by breaking his heart.  In doing this, Lara also ruins the marriage of her best friend, Izzie and her husband, Ben.  By the time the movie reaches its rather absurd conclusion, I found myself not liking any of the characters.Stephan Jenkins of Third Eye Blind struts around with his smirky good looks, tries to look buff and studly, but has the acting range of a tomato.  Joyce Hyser as Lara does a little better, but it's hard to believe she and Jenkins could have ever been good for each other.  Tembi Locke and David Deluise as the friends are almost likeable, but they both do some stupid things that ultimately deflate any potential of support.  Nichole Hiltz as the temptress Juliette is beautiful to look at, but vapid to experience her twisted game.  No suspense is generated, and the movie's technical look and feel are substandard.  While an interesting premise is offered, its execution is so preposterously unbelievable, ART OF REVENGE ends up little more than eye candy.",2,WHO DO YOU LIKE?,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,1676,"['ART', 'OF', 'REVENGE', 'ultimately', 'one', 'actually', 'root', 'meet', 'Matt', 'Kane', 'swooningly', 'handsome', 'young', 'designer', 'who', '7', 'years', 'marriage', 'have', 'hot', 'sex', 'lots', 'blondes', 'meet', 'Lara', 'Kane', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'who', 'stuck', 'supported', 'way', 'international', 'fame', 'Matt', 'decision', 'divorce', 'wife', 'told', 'have', 'baby', 'So', 'once', 'split', 'Lara', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'get', 'revenge', 'self-serving', 'egocentric', 'ex', 'voluptuous', 'anti-social', 'blonde', 'worm', 'way', 'Matt', 'life', 'get', 'fall', 'love', 'marry', 'then', 'ruin', 'life', 'breaking', 'heart', 'doing', 'Lara', 'also', 'marriage', 'best', 'friend', 'Izzie', 'husband', 'Ben', 'time', 'movie', 'rather', 'absurd', 'conclusion', 'found', 'not', 'liking', 'characters.Stephan', 'Jenkins', 'Third', 'Eye', 'Blind', 'around', 'smirky', 'good', 'looks', 'tries', 'look', 'buff', 'studly', 'acting', 'range', 'tomato', 'Joyce', 'Hyser', 'Lara', 'little', 'better', 'hard', 'believe', 'Jenkins', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'good', 'other', 'Tembi', 'Locke', 'David', 'Deluise', 'friends', 'are', 'almost', 'likeable', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'ultimately', 'deflate', 'potential', 'support', 'Nichole', 'Hiltz', 'temptress', 'Juliette', 'beautiful', 'look', 'vapid', 'experience', 'twisted', 'game', 'suspense', 'generated', 'movie', 'technical', 'look', 'feel', 'are', 'substandard', 'interesting', 'premise', 'offered', 'execution', 'so', 'preposterously', 'unbelievable', 'ART', 'OF', 'REVENGE', 'up', 'little', 'more', 'eye', 'candy']",N/A
