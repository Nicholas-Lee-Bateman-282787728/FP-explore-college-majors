735809,A22XHZ3MFP6MSV,B000089746,Cranky Reviewer,"[3, 3]","In this, the second DVD of the brilliant Fruits Basket series, Tohru gets her first indication that the Sohma curse is not all as cute and cuddly as she finds it.  At a school festival, she meets the affectionate and enthusiastic child, Momiji Sohma, and his attendant, the cold family doctor, Hatori.  Hatori speaks to her privately and orders her to meet him secretly at the main house of the Sohmas...a large mansion, far removed from Shigure's cosy, fragile little house in the woods.  There, Hatori warns her to flee the Sohma house while she still can.  Momiji tells Tohru later of Hatori's own private tragedy at the hands of the Sohmas.  On her departure, Tohru catches her first glance at Akito, the dreaded head of the family.Any fear that Hatori instilled is short-lived, though, and soon Tohru is her happy self again, planning New Years festivities and taking part in a trip to a hot spring...she meets two of the more psychotic members of the enormous Sohma family, outspends her budget, and takes part in a school endurance run.  Some very funny stuff on this disc, including Shigure's evading his editor, and Hana's participation in the school run.",5,&quot;A dark cloud of evil hangs over this house!&quot;,1074729600,"01 22, 2004",2004,1164,"['second', 'DVD', 'brilliant', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'series', 'Tohru', 'first', 'indication', 'Sohma', 'curse', 'not', 'all', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'school', 'festival', 'affectionate', 'enthusiastic', 'child', 'Momiji', 'Sohma', 'attendant', 'cold', 'family', 'doctor', 'Hatori', 'Hatori', 'privately', 'orders', 'meet', 'secretly', 'main', 'house', 'Sohmas', 'large', 'mansion', 'far', 'removed', 'Shigure', 'cosy', 'fragile', 'little', 'house', 'woods', 'Hatori', 'flee', 'Sohma', 'house', 'still', 'can', 'Momiji', 'Tohru', 'later', 'Hatori', 'own', 'private', 'tragedy', 'hands', 'Sohmas', 'departure', 'Tohru', 'first', 'glance', 'Akito', 'dreaded', 'head', 'family.Any', 'fear', 'Hatori', 'instilled', 'short-lived', 'soon', 'Tohru', 'happy', 'self', 'again', 'planning', 'New', 'Years', 'festivities', 'taking', 'part', 'trip', 'hot', 'spring', 'two', 'more', 'psychotic', 'members', 'enormous', 'Sohma', 'family', 'budget', 'part', 'school', 'endurance', 'run', 'very', 'funny', 'stuff', 'disc', 'including', 'Shigure', 'evading', 'editor', 'Hana', 'participation', 'school', 'run']",Fruits Basket: Volume Two: What Becomes of Snow?

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Having introduced the kooky Sohma family and their curse, ""Fruits Basket"" starts introducing some of its darker dimensions.To make matters even more complex, ""Fruits Basket, Volume 2: What Becomes of Snow?"" introduces us to three new members of the Sohma family, as well as a look at how the mysterious Akito rules over them. But despite these darker moments, the series never strays too far from the warm-hearted comedy and appealing characters.Our leads are all involved in the school's Cultural Festival, despite Yuki's distress at having to wear a dress. But then two new Sohmas turn up: bubbly rabbit Momiji, and the chilly Hatori, who tells Tohru to meet him at the Sohma main house -- alone. Despite Tohru's nervousness, she obeys -- and finds out the painful facts about Hatori's past, and the isolation felt by cursed Sohmas.When New Year's rolls around, Tohru and her friends help Kyo and Yuki clean the house, while Shigure torments his hysterical editor Mii. They're expected back at the main Sohma house, but the boys are reluctant to leave Tohru alone. And a school endurance run is interrupted by Haru Sohma, who is determined to fight Kyo -- but their battle is interrupted when Yuki collapses.Then Valentine's Day comes around. Tohru has chocolate for everyone (literally), Yuki is stalked by his fangirls, and Kagura is busily trying to feed Kyo a chocolate heart the size of his head. And a month later, Momiji repays Tohru's favour by giving her an extravagant gift -- a trip to a hot spring.There are definitely some darker moments to ""Volume 2: What Becomes of Snow?"" Most of these come from Hatori's tragic past, and the revelation of just what a lonely, painful life many of the zodiac members lead. Even the younger ones like Haru aren't immune, since we see that he was often mocked for his animal's part in the old zodiac folktale.But don't worry, the dark spots are surrounded by lots of heartwarming moments (Momiji's ""foolish traveler"" story) and goofy dialogue (""No means NO, woman!""). And there's loads of comedy, from Shigure tormented Mii by refusing to write the rest of his novel, to the shrieking hostess at the hot spring. (""AAAAAAAAA! I'm sorry, world! I apologize for this boy! I'm SORREEEEEE..."").I have to admit that the hot spring episode is a bit slow, since much of it involves eating and soaking. And singing. But it has some cute moments like Yuki laughing, and the crazed ping-pong game.We also get to see some different sides of Tohru and her friends -- for instance, it's revealed that despite her cheery demeanor, Tohru is sometimes very lonely for her mother. Yuki continues trying to come out of his shell, while Kyo verrrrrry slowly tries to overcome his social awkwardness. The ""plum on the back"" scene ends up being adorable because of this.And we get to meet some new Sohmas, particularly Haru and Hatori. Haru has a dual personality -- one placid and serene, one violent and lecherous -- and a tumultuous past with Yuki. And Hatori comes across as the most tragic figure thus far, convinced that he is doomed to loneliness, and haunted by what happened when he dared to love someone.""Fruits Basket, Volume 2: What Becomes of Snow?"" introduces us to some new Sohmas, and some dark secrets. But it also never lets up on the warm'n'fuzzy smiles.",4,It becomes spring!,1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,3300,"['Having', 'introduced', 'kooky', 'Sohma', 'family', 'curse', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'introducing', 'darker', 'dimensions.To', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'Volume', '2', 'What', 'Becomes', 'Snow', 'three', 'new', 'members', 'Sohma', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'look', 'how', 'mysterious', 'Akito', 'rules', 'darker', 'moments', 'series', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'warm-hearted', 'comedy', 'appealing', 'characters.Our', 'leads', 'are', 'involved', 'school', 'Cultural', 'Festival', 'Yuki', 'distress', 'having', 'wear', 'dress', 'then', 'two', 'new', 'Sohmas', 'turn', 'up', 'bubbly', 'rabbit', 'Momiji', 'chilly', 'Hatori', 'who', 'Tohru', 'meet', 'Sohma', 'main', 'house', 'alone', 'Tohru', 'nervousness', 'out', 'painful', 'facts', 'Hatori', 'past', 'isolation', 'felt', 'cursed', 'Sohmas.When', 'New', 'Year', 'rolls', 'Tohru', 'friends', 'help', 'Kyo', 'Yuki', 'clean', 'house', 'Shigure', 'torments', 'hysterical', 'editor', 'Mii', ""'re"", 'expected', 'back', 'main', 'Sohma', 'house', 'boys', 'are', 'reluctant', 'leave', 'Tohru', 'alone', 'school', 'endurance', 'run', 'interrupted', 'Haru', 'Sohma', 'who', 'determined', 'fight', 'Kyo', 'battle', 'interrupted', 'when', 'Yuki', 'collapses.Then', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'around', 'Tohru', 'chocolate', 'everyone', 'literally', 'Yuki', 'stalked', 'fangirls', 'Kagura', 'busily', 'trying', 'feed', 'Kyo', 'chocolate', 'heart', 'size', 'head', 'month', 'later', 'Momiji', 'Tohru', 'favour', 'giving', 'extravagant', 'gift', 'trip', 'hot', 'spring.There', 'are', 'definitely', 'darker', 'moments', 'Volume', '2', 'What', 'Becomes', 'Snow', 'Most', 'come', 'Hatori', 'tragic', 'past', 'revelation', 'just', 'what', 'lonely', 'painful', 'life', 'many', 'zodiac', 'members', 'lead', 'Even', 'younger', 'ones', 'Haru', 'are', ""n't"", 'immune', 'see', 'was', 'often', 'mocked', 'animal', 'part', 'old', 'zodiac', 'folktale.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'dark', 'spots', 'are', 'surrounded', 'lots', 'heartwarming', 'moments', 'Momiji', 'foolish', 'traveler', 'story', 'goofy', 'dialogue', 'NO', 'woman', 'loads', 'comedy', 'Shigure', 'tormented', 'Mii', 'refusing', 'write', 'rest', 'novel', 'shrieking', 'hostess', 'hot', 'spring', 'AAAAAAAAA', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'world', 'apologize', 'boy', ""'m"", 'SORREEEEEE', 'have', 'admit', 'hot', 'spring', 'episode', 'bit', 'slow', 'much', 'eating', 'soaking', 'singing', 'cute', 'moments', 'Yuki', 'laughing', 'crazed', 'ping-pong', 'game.We', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'different', 'sides', 'Tohru', 'friends', 'instance', 'revealed', 'cheery', 'demeanor', 'Tohru', 'sometimes', 'very', 'lonely', 'mother', 'Yuki', 'trying', 'come', 'shell', 'Kyo', 'verrrrrry', 'slowly', 'tries', 'overcome', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'plum', 'back', 'scene', 'up', 'being', 'adorable', 'this.And', 'get', 'meet', 'new', 'Sohmas', 'particularly', 'Haru', 'Hatori', 'Haru', 'dual', 'personality', 'one', 'placid', 'serene', 'one', 'violent', 'lecherous', 'tumultuous', 'past', 'Yuki', 'Hatori', 'most', 'tragic', 'figure', 'thus', 'far', 'convinced', 'doomed', 'loneliness', 'haunted', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'dared', 'love', 'someone', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'Volume', '2', 'What', 'Becomes', 'Snow', 'new', 'Sohmas', 'dark', 'secrets', 'also', 'never', 'up', 'warm', ""n'fuzzy"", 'smiles']",Fruits Basket: Volume Two: What Becomes of Snow?
735811,AWK4E3IB6SWEE,B000089746,"Karusichan ""Karusichan""","[1, 1]","Disc 2 of season one of Fruits Basket begins with an episode about teamwork. The students in Tohru, Yuki, and Kyo's class must make a rice ball stand, and they all have different ideas of how to run it. Ultimately they end up going with an idea of Yuki's, much to Kyo's annoyance. He also reveals to Tohru that he is envious of some of Yuki's personality traits, as Yuki revealed in the previous disc that he sometimes wishes he was like Kyo. This causes Tohru much contemplation, as she wishes that they could each openly admit their admiration for each other. On the day of the sale more Sohma's enter the picture. Momitchi (or Momiji) Sohma, the young boisterous lad who is possessed by the rabbit and Hatari (Ha'ri) Sohma who's animal manifests itself to appear as a seahorse, but in actuality is a dragon. They were both born  in 1987 and 1976 respectively, as close as I can figure it.Hatari becomes an important plot element as some of his past is quickly revealed. He was, in fact, engaged to a woman, a member of the Sohma clan who is not a zodiac member (not all Sohma's are). He encounters difficulty when he tells Akito, the head of the Sohma house hold, that he and Kana are to be wed, and Akito acts out against this by harming Hatari permanently. This scene was actually one of the first in the series that made me cry...one of the first, which implies that there are more tear-jerker moments, and trust me there are many heart sickening moments that these unfortunate cursed people end up having to endure.Another character is also introduced, in fact it's my favorite character, Hatsuharu Sohma, Haru to the family. This young man is possessed by the spirit of the ox and is born in the year 1985. He physically resembles his animal counterpart, what with his white tipped hair and black roots... his hair is so white that Tohru mistakenly thinks he is an older man passed out on the ground when she first meets him. The thing that draws me to Haru is his ""white/black"" sides. See, when he is ""white"" Haru he is docile and pleasant, like a cow, but when he is ""black"" Haru he becomes enraged like the bull, and it's hard to keep him from harming people. He also seems to suffer Tourette's syndrome when he is black Haru, which I find hysterical. I guess I have always been inclined to split personality characters, I can blame this on the fact that I am a Gemini, I suppose.Again, the series is wonderful. I can't say enough good things about it. I love the animation, the soundtrack is wonderful, most of the scores are very well done. I have been watching it in the dubbed version (eek, I know, I'm so unfaithful) and I find all of the voice actors to be very good. One thing I have noticed in my years of watching anime is that the dubbed voice acting has improved ten thousand fold. This is good for me, as I can never sit down and just watch anything, so I must have the dubbed on in order to be able to hear it with whatever else I am doing. I guess my only complaint is that there are not enough girls in it, but there are enough beautiful boys in it that I am not unhappy. It is Shojo after all, and what would Shojo anime be without bizarre circumstances, beautiful boys, and gut wrenching scenarios... oh, and there is, indeed, the delicious love story/triangle in place, which I imagine will only become juicier as the series progresses.

735812,A1KAUV9QYLP52J,B000089746,Kellyannl,"[3, 3]","In this volume, Tohru meets three more Zodiac members as word of her starts to spread through the Sohma family.First there's Momiji the Rabbit, a hyper, friendly boy who's both more childish and wiser than his years.  He hits it off with Tohru immediately and in most ways it's perhaps her easiest introduction.  She'll need it, because soon after she's unnerved by a meeting with Hatori the Dragon.  Although decent in and of himself, it's Hatori who will have to erase Tohru's memories if that's what word eventually comes down from Akito, so Yuki warns her never to let him see her alone.  Finally there's Hatsuharu the Ox, who's pretty tight with Yuki (and not so much with Kyo) as the Zodiac legend told earlier implied.  Haru's just about the nicest guy you could meet, his street tough appearance contrasting a sweet personality.  Unfortunately he suffers a split personality that makes Kagura's seem tame by comparison, which makes his first meeting with Tohru a bit of an experience.After the meetings, we get one of the funniest episodes so far.  Let's just say it involves Kyo, Kagura and Valentine's day.  Be  afraid.  Be very afraid.As usual, mixed in with comedy is more than a little drama.  Tohru sees Hatori in a different light when Momiji tells her his story; and she learns a little more about Yuki from Haru,  who tells her how he developed a crush on him when Yuki helped him overcome his humiliation at being the family joke because the Ox blindly gave the Rat a free ride to the banquet.A wonderful continuation.",4,Meet the Cousins,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,1536,"['volume', 'Tohru', 'three', 'more', 'Zodiac', 'members', 'word', 'starts', 'spread', 'Sohma', 'family.First', 'Momiji', 'Rabbit', 'hyper', 'friendly', 'boy', 'who', 'more', 'childish', 'wiser', 'years', 'off', 'Tohru', 'immediately', 'most', 'ways', 'perhaps', 'easiest', 'introduction', ""'ll"", 'need', 'soon', 'unnerved', 'meeting', 'Hatori', 'Dragon', 'decent', 'Hatori', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'erase', 'Tohru', 'memories', 'what', 'word', 'eventually', 'down', 'Akito', 'so', 'Yuki', 'never', 'let', 'see', 'alone', 'Finally', 'Hatsuharu', 'Ox', 'who', 'pretty', 'tight', 'Yuki', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Kyo', 'Zodiac', 'legend', 'told', 'earlier', 'implied', 'Haru', 'just', 'nicest', 'guy', 'could', 'meet', 'street', 'tough', 'appearance', 'contrasting', 'sweet', 'personality', 'Unfortunately', 'split', 'personality', 'Kagura', 'seem', 'tame', 'comparison', 'first', 'meeting', 'Tohru', 'bit', 'experience.After', 'meetings', 'get', 'one', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'so', 'far', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Kyo', 'Kagura', 'Valentine', 'day', 'Be', 'afraid', 'Be', 'very', 'afraid.As', 'usual', 'mixed', 'comedy', 'more', 'little', 'drama', 'Tohru', 'Hatori', 'different', 'light', 'when', 'Momiji', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'Yuki', 'Haru', 'who', 'how', 'developed', 'crush', 'when', 'Yuki', 'helped', 'overcome', 'humiliation', 'being', 'family', 'joke', 'Ox', 'blindly', 'gave', 'Rat', 'free', 'ride', 'banquet.A', 'wonderful', 'continuation']",Fruits Basket: Volume Two: What Becomes of Snow?

I still like Kyo best & he's developing well on this one. We meet Akito in Hatori's memories & see him hanging on a window sill watching Tohru--forboding enough. At this point he seems the stereotype selfish invalid(like Colin from Secret Garden), thus very threatening as the head of the family with the power to order Tohru's memories erased bt Hatori. My daughter & I died laughing at Shigure teasing his editor over the 500 pages she wanted from him & when he went off to school to pick up Yuki's homework singing ""High school girls"", we had to back up the dvd to see what we'd missed laughing.
