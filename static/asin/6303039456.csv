352162,A1PB2W640Z87RJ,6303039456,"Abhilash.R ""The Sagittarian""","[3, 4]","Bobsled to a Caribbean is like a Yeti to the Sahara desert. Both simply dont exist!. And yet, 4 guys with dreams in their eyes, set out to acheive the unmaginable in the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics. To represent their country Jamaica in Bobsledding!.&quot;Cool Runnings&quot; is based on this true story, but with a few changes that needless to say, is aimed at making the movie more dramatic. Leon(Derice Bannock)is an athlete aimed at making amends for his failure to secure a berth in the Jamaican Sprint Team. With no way out, he decides to try Bobsled, a sport no Caribbean in his right mind would even know it exists. Irv Blitzer(John Candy), a disgraced former champion Bobsledder decides to train Leon the intricacies of this &quot;bone-shattering&quot; sport. To compete in the event would however require 3 more bobsledders to make up the team. In comes his best friend Sanka(Doug.E.Doug), the tempermental Yul Brenner(Malik Yoba) and the reserved Junior Bevil(Rawle Lewis). What you end up with is a team of hysterical proportions, but with a heart.&quot;Cool Runnings&quot; is not so much about the event as it is with the main characters. The Jamaicans are determined to compete in an event that is considered solely the domain of a few Icelandic- Nordic nations. The 4 guys are felt out of place, racialized and ridiculed at the event while the coach(Candy) is humiliated and taunted at every turn by the organizers. The crux lays in how they overcome their hardships and ultimately win the crowd, if not a medal. The movie is absolutely hilarious considering the Jamaicans have never seen snow in real life. The initial training on their island is itself worth every penny you paid to watch this movie. However the movie's main strength is in its moral message. &quot;Believe&quot;. The movie is based entirely on this one word.Leon is superb in his role as the leader who never gives up. John Candy is without doubt an actor with a heart of gold. Every movie he has been involved in, he brings in that 'human element' into picture. He is perfect as the flawed but determined coach. The find of the movie however, is Rawle Lewis as Junior Beville. He has the best dialogues and behind that meek physique ,stands a truly compassionate and competitive character. Sanka is the funny bone whose expressions are enough to spill your guts out while Yul Brenner is a tough but protective fellow who eventually warms up to the team and gets transformed at the end of the event. Ultimately it is the will and the confidence they derive from each other at every turn of the event that makes this movie so heart-warming.The movie has a nice flow to it and the music is catchy. Jon Tutletaub(Director) puts everyting in the right place and the direction is straight forward but slick. Though some parts of the movie are fictionalized, it is forgivable since the main theme isn't lost. Infact it actually enhances it. I must say that movies like this generally tend to have a predictable ending. You'll know you'll have a happy one at that. But watch Cool Running's final few scenes and the phrase 'finish the race' will take a whole new meaning to you. The ending is inspiring..surprising..simply magnificent.

Leon (Darise Bannock) had a small supporting role in 'Cliffhanger' that same year, but gives the performance of his career in this movie. Malik Yoba and standup comic Doug E. Doug also took center stage in a movie that could've failed if Jamaica and Jamaican youth was stereotyped or presented unaccurately...But 'Cool Runnings' casted four great young start-up actors with perfect accents to represent the true story of this inspiring Olympic saga. This movie was an instant classic when it first came out, I think the first Jamaican bobsled team is probably proud of this representation of the story...of course, there were probably a few things in the movie that were only put in for effect..and Im sure the director left out any ugly parts that may have darkened the bright feel of the story..and for all we know what's in the movie may only be 90 or 95% of what actually happened.

The beauty of `Cool Runnings' is the fun, the sheer engaging entertainment value of the story and the approach taken, and the cast doesn't hurt.  With John Candy in one of his final roles, and a slew of talented young men taking on that unlikely bobsled team, this is a surefire hit for any household.A word of caution, there is some harsh language in scenes, and this is not a film directed at kids but more a film directed at families with older children.  There are some rough scenes (particularly a bar fight) but most of the film is shot for laughs, and it achieves those.The film is also built to evoke those feelings of triumph in the face of all odds, and it does that rather well (even if it verges on schmaltzy).  This true story of a Jamaican runner dreaming of the Olympics is one of those `you have to see it to believe it' type stories.  When an accident prevents him from competing, Derice is determined to compete in some way shape or form, and so he convinced Irv, a washed up former Olympian with a shoddy past, to coach him and some fellow Jamaicans to become the first ever Jamaican bobsled team.  The world laughed in their faces and yet they prevailed and won the respect of all.The dialog is sharp, the character development is actually quite rich (everyone has a backstory and everyone feels complete) and the end result is a film you can really stand up and cheer for.",5,Tugs at the heart and warms the soul...,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,1529,"['anyone', 'fact', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'are', 'movies', 'Cool', 'Runnings', 'proving', 'correct', 'statement', 'beauty', 'Cool', 'Runnings', 'fun', 'sheer', 'engaging', 'entertainment', 'value', 'story', 'approach', 'taken', 'cast', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'John', 'Candy', 'one', 'final', 'roles', 'slew', 'talented', 'young', 'men', 'taking', 'unlikely', 'bobsled', 'team', 'surefire', 'hit', 'household.A', 'word', 'caution', 'harsh', 'language', 'scenes', 'not', 'film', 'directed', 'kids', 'more', 'film', 'directed', 'families', 'older', 'children', 'are', 'rough', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'bar', 'fight', 'most', 'film', 'shot', 'laughs', 'those.The', 'film', 'also', 'built', 'evoke', 'feelings', 'triumph', 'face', 'odds', 'rather', 'well', 'even', 'schmaltzy', 'true', 'story', 'Jamaican', 'runner', 'dreaming', 'Olympics', 'one', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'type', 'stories', 'When', 'accident', 'competing', 'Derice', 'determined', 'compete', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'so', 'convinced', 'Irv', 'washed', 'up', 'former', 'Olympian', 'shoddy', 'past', 'coach', 'fellow', 'Jamaicans', 'become', 'first', 'ever', 'Jamaican', 'bobsled', 'team', 'world', 'laughed', 'yet', 'prevailed', 'won', 'respect', 'all.The', 'dialog', 'sharp', 'character', 'development', 'actually', 'quite', 'rich', 'everyone', 'backstory', 'everyone', 'feels', 'complete', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'can', 'really', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer']",Cool Runnings VHS

Wilkins ""star gazer""","[1, 1]","Yes, this was based on the true story of the Jamaican Bobsled team, the anomaly that took the Calgary Winter Olympics by surprise. As a rule, I am not fond of sports stories, but this one surprised me. A young Jamaican runner attempts to enter the Summer games but is stymied by another runner in the qualifying finals to enter when he his tripped up and left in the dust. Even though it is too late to enter into the Summer Olympics, he decides to try a winter sport, bobsledding. There are several problems, Jamaica is a Carribean Island Paradise that has never seen snow and bobsledding is almost unheard of there. No one is willing to lend a hand to help him as they are too busy laughing at the idea, but there is a way. His father knows of a former bobsledding champion living on the island who might be persuaded to coach a bobsled team--if he can find one. He winds up with a group of misfits including the runner that tripped him up. Persuading the coach isn't easy either and these are only the first of the hurdles he must pass if he is to even be in Calgary for the Games. Somehow, they manage to pull themselves together as they must literally learn everything from the ground up in a hurry as they are facing competition-and ridicule from the Champion athletes of the Ice, and the Coach, finds himself facing his past and trying to reconcile it for the sake of his team. In the end, their greatest hurdle is not to win, but to prove that they are every bit the champion athletes they hope to be.",5,A Cool Story.....,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,1509,"['Yes', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Jamaican', 'Bobsled', 'team', 'anomaly', 'took', 'Calgary', 'Winter', 'Olympics', 'surprise', 'rule', 'am', 'not', 'fond', 'sports', 'stories', 'one', 'surprised', 'young', 'Jamaican', 'runner', 'attempts', 'enter', 'Summer', 'games', 'stymied', 'runner', 'qualifying', 'finals', 'enter', 'when', 'tripped', 'up', 'left', 'dust', 'Even', 'too', 'late', 'enter', 'Summer', 'Olympics', 'try', 'winter', 'sport', 'bobsledding', 'are', 'several', 'problems', 'Jamaica', 'Carribean', 'Island', 'Paradise', 'never', 'seen', 'snow', 'bobsledding', 'almost', 'unheard', 'one', 'willing', 'lend', 'hand', 'help', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'laughing', 'idea', 'way', 'father', 'knows', 'former', 'bobsledding', 'champion', 'living', 'island', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'persuaded', 'coach', 'bobsled', 'team', 'can', 'find', 'one', 'up', 'group', 'misfits', 'including', 'runner', 'tripped', 'up', 'Persuading', 'coach', ""n't"", 'easy', 'are', 'only', 'first', 'hurdles', 'must', 'pass', 'even', 'be', 'Calgary', 'Games', 'Somehow', 'manage', 'pull', 'together', 'must', 'literally', 'learn', 'everything', 'ground', 'up', 'hurry', 'are', 'facing', 'competition-and', 'ridicule', 'Champion', 'athletes', 'Ice', 'Coach', 'facing', 'past', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'sake', 'team', 'end', 'greatest', 'hurdle', 'not', 'win', 'prove', 'are', 'bit', 'champion', 'hope', 'be']",Cool Runnings VHS

Based on a true story that is both touching and inspirational, Jon Turteltaub does a magnificent job of infusing enough humor and wit into this script to make it one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.  The story is about a young group of Jamaicans who are vying for a way to the Olympics.  Derice Bannock (Leon) has dreamed of running in the Olympics all his life.  His father was a famous Olympic runner and he dreamed of doing the same.  Junior Bevil (Lewis) lives under the strict watch of his wealthy father who humors Junior's fantasy about running in the Olympics but doesn't wholeheartedly support it.  And then we have Yul Brenner (Yoba) who lacks a good education but makes up for that with brute strength and arrogance.  On the day of the tryouts Junior takes a fall and trips up Yul and Derice ending all of their chances to make it to the Olympics.That is until they meet Irving Blitzer (Candy), an ex-bobsledder who knew Derice's father when they were in the Olympics together.  Irving had always believed that runners would make the best Bobsled team and now he had the opportunity to try that out.  With the help of Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug) they form the first Jamaican Bobsled team and head off to Canada to compete.They are met with serious scrutiny, not only because they are Jamaican but also because their coach, Irv, is hated among the Olympic community.  Irving was disqualified back in his Olympic days for hiding weights in the front of a sled to make it go faster, thus disqualifying, and humiliating his country, his teammates and his coach.  Thus, they don't like him very much and because of that the Jamaicans have to work extra hard to make an impression.  The film has plenty of funny scenes but it also has plenty of heart and by the end of the movie you'll be wiping away the tears and pushing through with a smile.  They don't make many movies like this one, so when they do we need to grab them and never let go.  `Cool Runnings' is definitely a one of a kind film, a film that's entertaining and suitable for the whole family, and one that any DVD library would be incomplete without!",5,"Funny, heartwarming...truly one of my all time favorite films...",1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,2234,"['Cool', 'Runnings', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'never', 'get', 'sick', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'touching', 'inspirational', 'Jon', 'Turteltaub', 'magnificent', 'job', 'infusing', 'enough', 'humor', 'wit', 'script', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'story', 'young', 'group', 'Jamaicans', 'who', 'are', 'vying', 'way', 'Olympics', 'Derice', 'Bannock', 'Leon', 'dreamed', 'running', 'Olympics', 'life', 'father', 'was', 'famous', 'Olympic', 'runner', 'dreamed', 'doing', 'same', 'Junior', 'Bevil', 'Lewis', 'strict', 'watch', 'wealthy', 'father', 'who', 'Junior', 'fantasy', 'running', 'Olympics', ""n't"", 'wholeheartedly', 'support', 'then', 'have', 'Yul', 'Brenner', 'Yoba', 'who', 'good', 'education', 'up', 'brute', 'strength', 'arrogance', 'day', 'tryouts', 'Junior', 'fall', 'up', 'Yul', 'Derice', 'ending', 'chances', 'make', 'Olympics.That', 'meet', 'Irving', 'Blitzer', 'Candy', 'ex-bobsledder', 'who', 'knew', 'Derice', 'father', 'when', 'were', 'Olympics', 'together', 'Irving', 'had', 'always', 'believed', 'runners', 'would', 'make', 'best', 'Bobsled', 'team', 'now', 'had', 'opportunity', 'try', 'out', 'help', 'Sanka', 'Coffie', 'Doug', 'E.', 'Doug', 'form', 'first', 'Jamaican', 'Bobsled', 'team', 'head', 'Canada', 'compete.They', 'are', 'met', 'serious', 'scrutiny', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'Jamaican', 'also', 'coach', 'Irv', 'hated', 'Olympic', 'community', 'Irving', 'was', 'disqualified', 'back', 'Olympic', 'days', 'hiding', 'weights', 'front', 'sled', 'make', 'go', 'faster', 'thus', 'disqualifying', 'humiliating', 'country', 'teammates', 'coach', 'Thus', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'much', 'Jamaicans', 'have', 'work', 'extra', 'hard', 'make', 'impression', 'film', 'plenty', 'funny', 'scenes', 'also', 'plenty', 'heart', 'end', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wiping', 'away', 'tears', 'pushing', 'smile', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'many', 'movies', 'one', 'so', 'when', 'do', 'need', 'grab', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'Cool', 'Runnings', 'definitely', 'one', 'kind', 'film', 'film', 'entertaining', 'suitable', 'whole', 'family', 'one', 'DVD', 'library', 'would', 'be', 'incomplete']",Cool Runnings VHS

352190,A103KNDW8GN92L,6303039456,David Hugaert,"[0, 4]","John Candy stars in a semi-dramatic role as Irv Blitzer, coach of the Jamaican Bobsled Team in &quot;Cool Runnings&quot;. Doug E. Doug and Malik Yoba offer fine supporting roles as well, as Blitzer's hard to teach pupils about the complex winter sport of bobsledding. In order to pull this feat off, an at first reluctant Coach Blitzer must mold his Jamaican recruits by teaching them the basics of the sport. The results start out rather rockily, for the rugged, tropical Jamaican landscape has absolutely nothing to offer in the form of snow, cold and ice, which would allow these first time bumbling Olympic athletic hopefuls to gain some further insight on how to better prepare themselves for the tough road ahead. The hilly Jamaican terrain would soon serve a purpose here, as the sport of bobsledding requires much agility and speed necessary to navigate the many curves and slopes throughout the course. But, in order for these athletic hopefuls to accomplish their goal, they need to raise money for the trip to Canada and the 1988 Winter Olympic Games. Despite the necessary coddling courtesy of Coach Blitzer, who is unable to borrow the $20.000 from the local Olympic Committee that is needed to send the troops to Calgary. On to Plan B, where our future Olympic hopefuls attempt to raise the money on their own through donations, but are only able to scrape up less than $1000, well short of the money needed for the trip. Plan C turns out to be the charm, as one of the athletes, named Junior, receives a cash loan (obtained by him through a small white lie) from his wealthy father (who wholeheartedly objects to his son's amateurish career choice), plus Junior having to sell his car to cover the remaining cost of the trip. Now, the wheels are set in motion. As soon as the boys and their coach arrive in Calgary, they receive a rather harsh greeting, courtesy of the harsh, bitterly cold winter weather. Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug), Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) and Derice Bannock (Leon), are having great difficulty in adjusting to their new winter environment, while Coach Blitzer seems to feel at home in the whitewash (he ought to, being that John Candy's Canadian! - although in the film he's from the U.S., kinda ironic, huh?). Blitzer sees to it that his boys are not affected by the negative surroundings, not to mention the harsh reception by everyone from the International Olympic Committee to the other athletes. The coach gives the guys a strict training regimen to better prepare them for their qualifying run, which got off to a shaky start, eventually being the laughingstock of the Olympic Games. Well, as they say, practice makes perfect, as Coach Blitzer &amp; Co. are off to try their nighttime practice qualifying run again, this time coming ever so closely to the one minute official qualifying time limit, but fall just short at finishing with a time of one minute, two seconds. The third time would be the charm, however, as the crew finished their final practice run before the real Olympic competition, finishing at under 1 minute (59.46 seconds, to be precise). Now, it's on to the real trials, where the Jamaicans come out of the gate slowly and unsurely, thus continually being mocked at by their adversaries. Coach Blitzer is proud of his team, nonetheless, so the guys go out and celebrate their somewhat major accomplishment, as a result of their second Olympic run. There's still more work to do, however, before the Jamaicans' third and final run, which is a must see. Many a viewer of &quot;Cool Runnings&quot;, will be both happy and heartbroken upon seeing the spellbinding ending, which will teach chidren a very important life lesson and instill confidence in them at the same time. Adults will like it for many of the same reasons, including the harsh Canadian environs in which &quot;Cool Runnings&quot; was filmed. The warm stylings of the reggae music are also a perfect compliment to both the Jamaican and Canadian environs, as well as to the film's soundtrack.

In this film the situation is of course incongruous :  four Jamaican athletes deciding to go to the Calgary Olympics in 1988 as a bobsledding team. Walt Disney uses all possible contradiction to make the story funny : warm Jamaica versus cold Canada, blacks versus whites, Jamaican easygoing spirit versus caucasian single-aimed concentration, father versus son, mother versus son, etc. But, and that is the real ethical genius of Walt Disney, every single laugh they create is there to deepen the best of all human morality. The main two ideas are : 1- Be proud of your roots and nature because that is your winning force ; 2- Refuse any kind of inferiority complex because you're different, and reject any kind of racism against your difference. Your difference is your strength and that is true of anyone, not only of people of a different color. It is true about culture, personality, sex, color, you name it you have it. This film is the best demonstration that the most powerful affirmative action comes from inside the individual, inside the team, inside the group you belong to, not from outside. Yet it is necessary to have a go-between, in this case a caucasian coach. He knows how to rebuff and negociate  racist  reactions. And he succeeds. And do not forget this marvelous lesson the end of this film gives you : no matter what, it is more important to take part and to cross the finish line than to win the gold medal, especially because if you only look at winning, you may be tempted to cheat. The aim of any human being on this earth is to achieve the best things he or she can, and to reach the finish line, the goal of his or her adventure, the aim of his or her attempt, and reaching that aim takes courage, strength, honor, honesty and moral beauty. This film should be shown in all schools all over the world for everyone to see what it takes to be oneself and what being oneself can give to the world.

352229,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6303039456,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[1, 1]","This movie is based on the first Jamaican bobsled team, which competed in the 1988 Olympics.  What I enjoy most about this movie is how the team was initially treated as a joke by fellow Jamaicans and their country, and even each other, but slowly gained the respect of not only their own countrymen, but experienced bobsled teams from other countries.The movie begins when two people who expected to join the Jamaican Olympic team in track and field events lose because a fellow runner fell.  The only other option for Derrice Bannock (Leon, who has appeared in ""All the Right Moves"" in 1983, ""Colors"" in 1988, and is the innocent man in Madonna's video ""Like a Prayer,"" along with numerous other movies) is to form a bobsled team and travel to the winter Olympics.Derrice manages to form a ragtag team consisting of Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug), Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) and Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba).  Derrice also finds disgraced former coach Irving Blitzer (John Candy, in one of his final roles) and convinces him to train the team.The movie then follows the team as they train in Jamaica.  We also watch as family, friends and government officials do everything possible to discourage the team from pursuing their goal.  Even officials with the Olympics do their best to keep the team from entering the Olympics.As the movie progressed there was a point where I actually started to care about the characters, and I wanted the Jamaican team to do well against the established teams.  I supposed that my natural tendency to support underdogs took control here, but I was pleased that the Jamaicans more than competed; they competed and were holding their own.  I will leave it to the viewer to see what happens at the end.While this movie is funny, the humor is obtained with respect toward the characters.  Disney has had its ups and downs in recent years with movie quality, but I would consider this movie one of the ups.  There are a number of stereotypical portrayals, but this is a movie and Disney wanted to be very clear as to who the good guys and the bad guys were.This movie is one that you will want to watch more than once.  While the real Jamaican team that inspired this movie was lost in the humor and the drama created to make the movie entertaining, I believe you will enjoy the humor and the ending where, in traditional Disney style, everything works out in the end.",5,Team Jamaica in the Winter Olympics,1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,2394,"['movie', 'based', 'first', 'Jamaican', 'bobsled', 'team', 'competed', '1988', 'Olympics', 'What', 'enjoy', 'most', 'movie', 'how', 'team', 'was', 'initially', 'treated', 'joke', 'fellow', 'Jamaicans', 'country', 'even', 'other', 'slowly', 'gained', 'respect', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'countrymen', 'experienced', 'bobsled', 'teams', 'other', 'countries.The', 'movie', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'expected', 'join', 'Jamaican', 'Olympic', 'team', 'track', 'field', 'events', 'lose', 'fellow', 'runner', 'fell', 'only', 'other', 'option', 'Derrice', 'Bannock', 'Leon', 'who', 'appeared', 'Right', 'Moves', '1983', 'Colors', '1988', 'innocent', 'man', 'Madonna', 'video', 'Prayer', 'numerous', 'other', 'movies', 'form', 'bobsled', 'team', 'travel', 'winter', 'Olympics.Derrice', 'form', 'ragtag', 'team', 'consisting', 'Sanka', 'Coffie', 'Doug', 'E.', 'Doug', 'Junior', 'Bevil', 'Rawle', 'D.', 'Lewis', 'Yul', 'Brenner', 'Malik', 'Yoba', 'Derrice', 'also', 'disgraced', 'former', 'coach', 'Irving', 'Blitzer', 'John', 'Candy', 'one', 'final', 'roles', 'train', 'team.The', 'movie', 'then', 'team', 'train', 'Jamaica', 'also', 'watch', 'family', 'friends', 'government', 'officials', 'do', 'everything', 'possible', 'discourage', 'team', 'pursuing', 'goal', 'Even', 'officials', 'Olympics', 'do', 'best', 'keep', 'team', 'entering', 'Olympics.As', 'movie', 'progressed', 'was', 'point', 'where', 'actually', 'started', 'care', 'characters', 'wanted', 'Jamaican', 'team', 'do', 'well', 'established', 'teams', 'supposed', 'natural', 'tendency', 'support', 'underdogs', 'took', 'control', 'here', 'was', 'pleased', 'Jamaicans', 'more', 'competed', 'competed', 'were', 'holding', 'own', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'see', 'what', 'end.While', 'movie', 'funny', 'humor', 'obtained', 'respect', 'characters', 'Disney', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'recent', 'years', 'movie', 'quality', 'would', 'consider', 'movie', 'one', 'ups', 'are', 'number', 'stereotypical', 'portrayals', 'movie', 'Disney', 'wanted', 'be', 'very', 'clear', 'who', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'were.This', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'real', 'Jamaican', 'team', 'inspired', 'movie', 'was', 'lost', 'humor', 'drama', 'created', 'make', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'believe', 'will', 'enjoy', 'humor', 'ending', 'where', 'traditional', 'Disney', 'style', 'everything', 'out', 'end']",Cool Runnings VHS

How much of the details of the film are actual facts is unknown but it is true that Jamaica did send a four man bobsled team to the 1988 Olympics in Calgary. This is the funny and inspiring story of how it came about, how they got there and what happened once they arrived. I'm not always a big John Candy fan but I think you'll like him in this film. More than just a comedy - I start laughing when I hear Jamaica, Olympic and bobsled all in the same sentence - this is a film about a world class athlete who loses his chance to compete in the Summer Olympics and is determined to get to the Olympics no matter how. What happens when he and John Candy, a former Olympic Gold Medalist in bobsledding for the USA, who is a down and out bookie living in Jamaica, get together is pure fun and magic. While there is no easy way to learn bobsledding in Jamaica, it won't be for lack of trying if they don't. This is the kind of film that Walt Disney built its reputation on. An upbeat soundtrack of Reggae music adds to the film as well as the great scenery.

This movie is about the unlikely event of a Jamaican bobsled team competing in the olympics (it actually happened though).  John Candy does a great job of portraying a coach that is disturbed about his past as an olympian, and has become the total opposite of an olympian.  Anyway as the story goes two friends (an olympic sprinter hopeful Darice, and a pushcart driver Sanka) have a plan to form a bobsled team after an olympic trial mishap for Darice that prevented him from going to the summer olympics.  They meet up with two other Jamaicans (who also happen to be the other two sprinters involved in the olympic trial mishap), and  with their future coach (John Candy), and then head off on a hilarious journey to the 1988 Calgary Olympics.  This movie is very hilarious all they way through until the last half hour  when everything catches up with the team, and then the movie takes a sudden heart warming turn that tugs at your heart.  Then to top it all off on the third day something tragic happens, and then the movie truly becomes inspiring, and brings out your spirit of competition.Anyway enough about the movie, buy it, and enjoy it over and over again.",5,Inspiring!,1020902400,"05 9, 2002",2002,1320,"['watching', 'movie', 'found', 'inspiring', 'out', 'spirit', 'competition', 'also', 'feeling', 'hope', 'desire', 'movie', 'unlikely', 'event', 'Jamaican', 'bobsled', 'team', 'competing', 'olympics', 'actually', 'happened', 'John', 'Candy', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'coach', 'disturbed', 'past', 'olympian', 'become', 'total', 'opposite', 'olympian', 'Anyway', 'story', 'two', 'friends', 'olympic', 'sprinter', 'hopeful', 'Darice', 'pushcart', 'driver', 'Sanka', 'have', 'plan', 'form', 'bobsled', 'team', 'olympic', 'trial', 'mishap', 'Darice', 'prevented', 'going', 'summer', 'olympics', 'meet', 'up', 'two', 'other', 'Jamaicans', 'who', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'other', 'two', 'sprinters', 'involved', 'olympic', 'trial', 'mishap', 'future', 'coach', 'John', 'Candy', 'then', 'head', 'off', 'hilarious', 'journey', '1988', 'Calgary', 'Olympics', 'movie', 'very', 'hilarious', 'way', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'when', 'everything', 'up', 'team', 'then', 'movie', 'sudden', 'heart', 'warming', 'turn', 'heart', 'Then', 'top', 'off', 'third', 'day', 'something', 'tragic', 'happens', 'then', 'movie', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'out', 'spirit', 'competition.Anyway', 'enough', 'movie', 'buy', 'enjoy', 'over', 'again']",Cool Runnings VHS
