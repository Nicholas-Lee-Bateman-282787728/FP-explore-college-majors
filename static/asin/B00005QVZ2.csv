The movie was actually pretty good.The movie is about a boy named Alan(Sean Astin) who goes camping with Vic(Kevin Bacon) and 3 other boys and Vic is taking these boys out here to teach them the ways of the wilderness. Things start out pretty well but Vic then starts to push the boys too hard, especially Alan. Vic is trying to teach the boys the best he can but his ways of doing it are a bit rough on the kids. Should the kids stay and be tought by Vic, or should they try to go home? him.I gave the movie 3 stars because some parts of the story were unclear or they weren't very good. But the good points of the movie were the scenery, the music and the action.

675730,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005QVZ2,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 6]","""White Water Summer"" cannot be accused of being a great film.  It's got its silly moments, unbelievable moments, and downright psychotic moments.  My wife first introduced me to this film a few years ago and ever since that time, I've never been able to pass it up when it's on the satellite.  It's just fun to watch and reminds me of a cool time in my life (that being the 80's).It stars a young Kevin Bacon and an even younger Sean Astin.  Both are excellent in their roles.  Bacon must have been studying up for his future psychotic role in ""The River Wild"" with this film.  He plays Vic, a not-all-there, hopefully well-meaning but very unlikeable camp guide who takes Astin and three other city kids into the wild in order to teach them about themselves.  The supporting cast is headed up by Matt Adler (""Teen Wolf,"" among other 80's classics), K.C. Martel (best known as one of Kirk Cameron's buds on ""Growing Pains,"" and Jonathan Ward (""Steel Magnolias"" and ""Charles In Charge"").  Although all three of these guys are recognizable, they've almost always played supporting characters.The story, as stated previously, is about Vic taking four city boys on an adventure in the wilderness.  Astin narrates this tale about becoming a man over the summer.  Bacon's character is hard to place.  At first, he comes across as a ""tough love"" advocate, but then he becomes a wee bit crazy.  Almost immediately the other boys separate themselves from Astin, with Ward sometimes sticking up for him.  In the end, however, all of them have to come together in order to save Bacon's life.The film has a great 80's soundtrack featuring Journey, Cutting Crew, and other rockers from the decade of excess.Overall, not the greatest film around, but it does fit the bill as a nostalgic tale sure to bring back wonderful memories.  Parents should be warned that there is a lot of bad language in this flick.  Astin even drops an ""F"" bomb, so be sure to monitor any kids with you.  I'm sure this film would have gotten a PG-13 rating had it come out just a few years later.Recommended to fans of old 80's flicks who still remember watching some of these films when they were young.",4,It's Just A Fun Flick To Watch,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,2166,"['White', 'Water', 'Summer', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'got', 'silly', 'moments', 'unbelievable', 'moments', 'downright', 'psychotic', 'moments', 'wife', 'first', 'introduced', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'ever', 'time', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'able', 'pass', 'up', 'when', 'satellite', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'reminds', 'cool', 'time', 'life', 'being', '80', '.It', 'young', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'even', 'younger', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'Bacon', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'studying', 'up', 'future', 'psychotic', 'role', 'River', 'Wild', 'film', 'Vic', 'not-all-there', 'hopefully', 'well-meaning', 'very', 'unlikeable', 'camp', 'guide', 'who', 'Astin', 'three', 'other', 'city', 'kids', 'wild', 'order', 'teach', 'supporting', 'cast', 'headed', 'up', 'Matt', 'Adler', 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'other', '80', 'classics', 'K.C', 'Martel', 'best', 'known', 'one', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'buds', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'Jonathan', 'Ward', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'Charles', 'Charge', 'three', 'guys', 'are', 'recognizable', ""'ve"", 'almost', 'always', 'played', 'supporting', 'characters.The', 'story', 'stated', 'previously', 'Vic', 'taking', 'four', 'city', 'boys', 'adventure', 'wilderness', 'Astin', 'tale', 'becoming', 'man', 'summer', 'Bacon', 'character', 'hard', 'place', 'first', 'across', 'tough', 'love', 'advocate', 'then', 'wee', 'bit', 'crazy', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'other', 'boys', 'separate', 'Astin', 'Ward', 'sometimes', 'sticking', 'up', 'end', 'however', 'have', 'come', 'together', 'order', 'save', 'Bacon', 'life.The', 'film', 'great', '80', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Journey', 'Cutting', 'Crew', 'other', 'rockers', 'decade', 'excess.Overall', 'not', 'greatest', 'film', 'around', 'fit', 'bill', 'nostalgic', 'tale', 'sure', 'bring', 'back', 'wonderful', 'memories', 'Parents', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'lot', 'bad', 'language', 'flick', 'Astin', 'even', 'F', 'bomb', 'so', 'be', 'sure', 'monitor', 'kids', ""'m"", 'sure', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'later.Recommended', 'fans', 'old', '80', 'flicks', 'who', 'still', 'remember', 'watching', 'films', 'when', 'were', 'young']",N/A
675731,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B00005QVZ2,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[1, 1]","First off, this movie was made in 1987, not 1991. I am not sure if that's supposed to be the year it came out for rental or what but wanted to make that clear.White Water Summer has beautiful scenery and some minor exciting moments but when you get down to it it's a low-grade Lord of the Flies and not nearly as interesting.Kevin Bacon who is his best when playing bad plays Vick, a sadist with a creepy appetite for torturing the young campers he's been put in charge of. He especially loves to torment Allen (Sean Astin) because he feels Allen needs to learn the hard way how to become a man. Throughout the film, they raft, talk, sing, eat, camp and Allen is thrown into life-threatening predicaments and Vick seems to get off on that. The first sign that Vick is unstable is when the group has to cross a rickety bridge that's sky-high in the air. Allen is afraid to climb so Vick takes the group and leaves him there until he whimpers across. When Allen gets back to the camp, he realizes he's left the tent poles on the other side of the bridge. Terrified, he follows Vick's orders to get the poles but freezes on the bridge. When Allen returns, he lies and says he couldn't find the poles and Vick throws them on the ground. The next morning and enraged Vick tells Allen he watched him chicken out on the bridge. (That's right, watched and didn't help).So that's the first red sign we see that Vick is off. After that he leaves Allen hanging on a cliff as well as across the creek in the rain until he cleans fish. Allen refuses so he stays all night alone in the rain.The movie was like watching a ping-pong match. It was back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. They did the same things over and over. Vick would terrorize Allen and the gang would sit back and let it happen. Finally Allen shows he has the real guts by the end of the film.Kevin Bacon was fantastic and Sean Astin was good but the plot didn't work. We should've seen more of a reason why Vick was so screwed up or why he picked on Allen. His character could be better understood. At the end Allen stays with Vick after he breaks his leg and even gets him across the river alone. The two talk a bit and this would've been the perfect opportunity for Allen and the audience to find out why Vick treated him the way he did but they didn't go into it. So the fact that Vick's behavior happened without any reason didn't work. I wanted to know why this man was so screwed up and if so, why is he taking kids camping in the first place?Sean was realistic as Allen. The rest of the boys (who are obviously just there to be someone to fight for Allen) were forgettable. They weren't even significant enough to remember their names. I think the movie would've been edgier if maybe Allen was stuck with Vick alone and had to climb himself outta the mountains with a crazed Vick refusing to let him go.  But...didn't work out that way.This movie isn't terrible but it surely isn't anything you have to see. I'd put it in the, check-it-out-when-it-comes-on-cable-one-night category. It's nothing you should make an effort to watch just something to catch (if you want) when it's on. Despite all the fantastic scenery this movie was boring and very slow-paced. It was like two hours of nothing. I got the feeling the filmmakers were showcasing the scenery more than the movie and expecting that to make up for all the low points. I didn't know if I was watching a movie or NatGeo special at one point. No one did anything until almost the end of the film. I'd say skip everything that happened before the bridge because it's insignificant.Also having Astin talk to the camera was stupid and a bad attempt at trying to put in some comic relief in such a disturbing film.Unless you're a Kevin Bacon fan, skip this. Check out River Wild if you just wanna see Kevin playing a bad dude on the river.

675733,A2SPI5WNZLOJ2U,B00005QVZ2,Sal Nudo,"[0, 0]","Mismatched ambiances throughout the narrative make this a strange movie. The story begins with a precocious teen named Alan (played by Sean Astin), who philosophizes on the ways of the world as he sits in a tree. Alan has got life all figured out, thanks to a harrowing summer experience he had not long ago.Flashback to an earlier period in Alan's recent existence: A dorkier-looking, less confident Alan is resisting pleas from his father and a smooth-talking nature dude named Vic, played by Kevin Bacon. Both desperately want Alan to attend Vic's two-bit summer camp. Personally, it seems like something is afoul right off the bat about Vic's demeanor and pitch, but Alan's father doesn't see anything amiss -- soon the citified Alan is off to summer camp with three other typecast boys. Due to camp leader Vic's perfectionistic ways, what follows is a series of increasingly disturbing events that severely clash with the movie's happy-go-lucky intro.What's most frustrating about ""White Water Summer"" is that Bacon's character, by far the most interesting of the bunch, is not explored in the least. Where does this wistful oddball come from, and what made him start a summer camp for youngsters? Does he actually make a fruitful living as a singular camp leader or does he have another job back in the city? Bacon plays his role in a mostly understated, nuanced way, which is good, but his actions -- such as meditating in the forest one moment and angrily throwing a radio the next -- cry out for more background. Vic becomes downright sadistic as things progress, which admittedly gives the storyline worthwhile oomph.One astounding aspect of this movie is the camp-related activities that Vic forces upon this small troop of kids. At one point they walk across an extremely high-in-the-air rope bridge that looks as if it could snap at any moment; not long after they go mountain climbing and find themselves on precarious ledges that are truly scary to look at if you aren't fond of heights. It doesn't appear at all as if stuntmen filled in. Whatever salaries these young actors received in 1987 to make this movie, they probably weren't high enough.When the story plays out and an injured Vic shares an awkward concluding moment with the apparently enlightened and bolder Alan, viewers are left with unanswered questions. Did the seemingly mentally unstable Vic get in trouble for his crimes? How did the other kids fare after they separated from Alan and Vic? There are probably a few other things to ponder, but instead we'll cue the upbeat Journey song and throw in a dumb quip by Alan to wrap things up in the carefree way they began.
