Seriously, WTF was this movie meant to be about? Part biker, part night of the living dead, part exorcist, part grindhouse, part ET - I could go on!! It had potential for sure, but didnt cut it in the end. On a positive note, I quite liked the people who played Cody, Megan & Shade, it's a shame they had to be in this mix up of a movie to get noticed. If they had left it as a fun grindhouse splatter movie it would have got more stars from me.",2,Glad I hired this first,1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,660,"['movie', 'had', 'been', 'must', 'watch', 'list', 'ages', 'highliy', 'anticipated', 'watching', ""'m"", 'sad', 'say', 'didnt', 'really', 'go', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'hired', 'instead', 'buying', 'outright', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Seriously', 'WTF', 'was', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'Part', 'biker', 'part', 'night', 'living', 'dead', 'part', 'exorcist', 'part', 'grindhouse', 'part', 'ET', 'could', 'go', 'had', 'potential', 'sure', 'cut', 'end', 'positive', 'note', 'quite', 'liked', 'people', 'who', 'played', 'Cody', 'Megan', 'Shade', 'shame', 'had', 'be', 'mix', 'up', 'movie', 'get', 'noticed', 'had', 'left', 'fun', 'grindhouse', 'splatter', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'got', 'more', 'stars']",N/A

The opening was ok, and the ending was ok, but the intervening 80% of the movie just dragged slowly without any particularly inspiring action.  Several observations.  First, despite the movie's description, the film really isn't that violent or gory.  I don't especially like gore and/or gratuitous violence and had no problem watching this film, so don't be dissuaded on that basis.  Second, also despite references to paranormal activity, things just basically happen with no explanation or believable element.  Granted, the overwhelming majority of horror films are not quite believable, but they at least try to present a story to explain why a certain something has happened.  Not so in this movie; a group of people find themselves at a party, then wham, someone gets possessed and more bad things happen.  It simply goes through the paces of what a usual horror film includes without any useful plot elements to create a story and weave it all together.  Fans of Tiffany Shepis will be only partially pleased, as her role is somewhat short, and most of it is her (SPOILER) as a possessed demon-like being, but you still get some.

1412331,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004KNO770,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","What's most irritating about the Violent Kind is the 25 minutes in the beginning that accomplishes nothing of interest.  Just a bunch of young people partying, goofing off, making out, having conversations about nothing important, etc.  We've seen this kind of generic storytelling for years so it's nothing new.  Another annoying aspect is how the enemy just APPEARS with no dramatic or enticing build-up of any sort.The only really entertaining moment comes when the one woman is covered in blood and acting fishy, so her friends tie her up in the bedroom.  Well one of the perverted guys decides to attempt to take advantage of her while she's in a blood-soaked, oddly peaceful state of mind.  To HIS surprise, she actually likes being touched between the legs.  That's because she's now possessed and ready to rip him a new one!  Shortly after when the other friends are aware what's going on, they slowly walk into the bedroom and approach the demon woman with extreme caution.  Where did she hide?  Not under the bed, not in the closet but... on the ceiling!  Excellent segment.However it's impossible to overlook the poor acting and storytelling.  The actual demonic figures that appear later are more like badly designed costumes with less than spectacular line deliveries making it feel like you're watching a high school play, and the computer effects that emphasize the demonic presence near the end is totally laughable.  Overall, it has its moments but is mostly a flawed affair.",3,not bad,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,1492,"['What', 'most', 'irritating', 'Violent', 'Kind', '25', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'nothing', 'interest', 'Just', 'bunch', 'young', 'people', 'partying', 'goofing', 'off', 'making', 'out', 'having', 'conversations', 'nothing', 'important', 'etc', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kind', 'generic', 'storytelling', 'years', 'nothing', 'new', 'annoying', 'aspect', 'how', 'enemy', 'just', 'APPEARS', 'dramatic', 'enticing', 'build-up', 'sort.The', 'only', 'really', 'entertaining', 'moment', 'when', 'one', 'woman', 'covered', 'blood', 'acting', 'fishy', 'friends', 'tie', 'up', 'bedroom', 'Well', 'one', 'perverted', 'guys', 'attempt', 'take', 'advantage', 'blood-soaked', 'oddly', 'peaceful', 'state', 'mind', 'HIS', 'surprise', 'actually', 'being', 'touched', 'legs', 'now', 'possessed', 'ready', 'rip', 'new', 'one', 'Shortly', 'when', 'other', 'friends', 'are', 'aware', 'what', 'going', 'slowly', 'walk', 'bedroom', 'approach', 'demon', 'woman', 'extreme', 'caution', 'Where', 'did', 'hide', 'Not', 'bed', 'not', 'closet', 'ceiling', 'Excellent', 'segment.However', 'impossible', 'overlook', 'poor', 'acting', 'storytelling', 'actual', 'demonic', 'figures', 'appear', 'later', 'are', 'more', 'badly', 'designed', 'costumes', 'less', 'spectacular', 'line', 'deliveries', 'making', 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'computer', 'effects', 'emphasize', 'demonic', 'presence', 'end', 'totally', 'laughable', 'Overall', 'moments', 'mostly', 'flawed', 'affair']",N/A

It's a biker meets zombie-ish movie. But it's way cool.Here's the scoop. Bikers Cody, Elroy and Q are headed up to Northern California, and some remote house, to celebrate biker mom's 50th birthday. Both the earlier and newer members of this club are partying hard. But as things thin out weird stuff begins to happen. The sky develops a weird aurora, cell phones go nutso, cars won't start, and Cody's ex-gal turns into some carnivorous thingoid. Next thing you know they are set upon by some retro 50s guys and gals intent on releasing whatever alien thing is residing inside Cody's ex-gal.I had a really good time watching this movie. I don't know squat about the butcher brothers and had no expectations going in so I was pleasantly surprised. This is not an expensive movie but I felt the money was well spent. I liked the direction. The shots were set up well and the special effects were good enough to get the point across. The writing was decent as well. They didn't just set up the situation and hack their way to the end. The main characters have histories so there's some gravity to the proceedings. The music was pretty good, particularly the 50s rock-a-billy type tunes. The performances were generally decent with the exception of the Vernon. Joe Egender, as Vernon, was outstanding. He reminded me of a thin-faced Giovanni Rabisi. Things ramped up a few notches when he and his friends hit the screen.There are some hints as to why this is all happening. Vernon and his pals went missing in 1955 and there are some references to Jonas Saulk, the relevance of which I didn't understand. But, again, this isn't just a gory romp. And the ending was as cool as I've ever seen in a movie. Some might say it's nothing more than an open door to a sequel. It is certainly part that but it struck me with much greater impact.This won't set the world on fire or change your life but, for my time and money, it's a solid entry to the genre.",4,What a Romp,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,2074,"['can', 'not', 'dictate', 'something', 'nature', 'people', 'say', 'what', 'not', 'aspire', 'lofty', 'post', 'biker', 'zombie-ish', 'movie', 'way', 'scoop', 'Bikers', 'Cody', 'Elroy', 'Q', 'are', 'headed', 'up', 'Northern', 'California', 'remote', 'house', 'celebrate', 'biker', 'mom', '50th', 'birthday', 'earlier', 'newer', 'members', 'club', 'are', 'partying', 'hard', 'things', 'thin', 'out', 'weird', 'stuff', 'happen', 'sky', 'weird', 'aurora', 'cell', 'phones', 'go', 'nutso', 'cars', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', 'Cody', 'ex-gal', 'turns', 'carnivorous', 'thingoid', 'Next', 'thing', 'know', 'are', 'set', 'upon', 'retro', '50s', 'guys', 'gals', 'intent', 'releasing', 'alien', 'thing', 'residing', 'Cody', 'ex-gal.I', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'squat', 'butcher', 'brothers', 'had', 'expectations', 'going', 'so', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'not', 'expensive', 'movie', 'felt', 'money', 'was', 'well', 'spent', 'liked', 'direction', 'shots', 'were', 'set', 'up', 'well', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'get', 'point', 'writing', 'was', 'decent', 'as', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'set', 'up', 'situation', 'hack', 'way', 'end', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'histories', 'gravity', 'proceedings', 'music', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'particularly', '50s', 'rock-a-billy', 'type', 'tunes', 'performances', 'were', 'generally', 'decent', 'exception', 'Vernon', 'Joe', 'Egender', 'Vernon', 'was', 'outstanding', 'reminded', 'thin-faced', 'Giovanni', 'Rabisi', 'Things', 'ramped', 'up', 'few', 'notches', 'when', 'friends', 'hit', 'screen.There', 'are', 'hints', 'why', 'happening', 'Vernon', 'pals', 'went', 'missing', '1955', 'are', 'references', 'Jonas', 'Saulk', 'relevance', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'again', ""n't"", 'just', 'gory', 'romp', 'ending', 'was', 'as', 'cool', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'might', 'say', 'nothing', 'more', 'open', 'door', 'sequel', 'certainly', 'part', 'struck', 'much', 'greater', 'impact.This', 'wo', ""n't"", 'set', 'world', 'fire', 'change', 'life', 'time', 'money', 'solid', 'entry', 'genre']",N/A

It jumps all over the place and never quite lands on one category or another but tickles each.A group of bikers are getting together at a secluded farm far out in the country. They party hard and tensions rise when one of the members, Cody, sees his ex Michelle with a new boyfriend. She's a tease and knows it, doing all she can to incite him to violence. Hey maybe that's because he's ""the violent kind"". Hmmm.So the party drags on for a while and her little sister Megan back from college is there as well. This is the good girl who, for the life of me, I can't figure out why she's at the party. You would think she would be well aware of the type of things that happen at these parties but apparently she is more innocent than can be believed. She has a thing for this Cody and has since she was a teen. Ah young love.Things turn crazy when Michelle tries to leave later than most guests. Cody, his best friend and his girlfriend and Megan are all that's left but going down the road they come across Michelle and her new beau's car. Michelle has been hurt and the guy is dead. Oh but things get better.Once back at the house, Michelle becomes possessed by some sort of demon. Trapped in the house with no idea who is the cause of this, the threesome decides to try and escape. The only problem is that it is a group of ghosts from the fifties who have taken over the house and intend to kill each of them.This group is made up of all sorts of cool cats. Greaser, stylish mod, you name it, the different groups are represented here. And they intend to wreak havoc.  Who will stop them? Who cares! I'm telling you by this point I was so bored and tired of the bad acting, bad photography, bad direction, bad script...nearly bad everything...that I didn't care and didn't want to know. I just wanted it to be over.The fortunate characters in this film were the ones killed early on in it. Not because they didn't have to be eviscerated or suffer broken limbs but because they didn't have to suffer through the boring rubbish that is called THE VIOLENT KIND.No heroes, all villains, poor possession, biker wannabes and fifties doo whop do not combine to make a good movie.
