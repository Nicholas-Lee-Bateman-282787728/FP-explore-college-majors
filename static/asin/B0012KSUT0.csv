1137847,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0012KSUT0,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","My feelings concerning horse adventure/competition movies is that most of them are essentially the same.  This movie certainly doesn't stand out among the genre.  A girl stumbles across a horse, falls in love with it and wants to raise it, and eventually partakes in a competition at the end.  Rinse and repeat.  Of course it's easy for me to say these type of horse films are all the same since I have no personal experience owning and raising horses, and therefore my feelings may very well be different from someone who's been raising and caring for them for years.  Sort of like how dog owners can't relate to dog haters... but less drastic, hehe.Anyway, Moondance Alexander is a really well-written and well made movie about a girl that immediately shows an incredible amount of affection for a horse that happens to jump out in front of her bike while travelling down a back road one day, that she searches for the owner of the horse.  This man happens to look remarkably similar to WWF wrestler Bret Hart (have you SEEN him lately?  He looks just like *this* guy!) so... as you can probably guess, she does everything she possibly can for the horse until the inevitable competition takes place.  Of course she has arrogant and sassy classmates who think THEY have the winning horse.  We've seen the same storyline so many times.  These classmates are of course, the bad guys that wanna see her fail so they can laugh and mock her.  You know where this is going, trust me.One thing I can't fault is the presentation.  This movie looks REALLY good.  The writing may be predictable but the way the scenery looks and the many segments showing the girl taking care of the horse look absolutely astonishing.  Great job there.  Also, maybe it's just a really big coincidence, but the girl playing this role (Kay Panabaker) looks identical to a few horse caretakers that I know.  Interesting there.  This means she's *perfect* for the role.  Also, a slight similarity to Judy Garland isn't out of the question either.  They both have a way of lighting up the screen when they smile.My only complaint (other than the predictable writing) is that the actual competition that takes place at the end is based around horse jumps instead of an actual horse race, which means it's not a very dramatic or thrilling (or fitting) conclusion.  Instead it's lacking.  Other than this, it's all the same thing you've seen plenty of times before so you can take or leave this one.",3,horse ridin' adventure,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,2465,"['feelings', 'concerning', 'horse', 'adventure/competition', 'movies', 'most', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'genre', 'girl', 'horse', 'love', 'raise', 'eventually', 'partakes', 'competition', 'end', 'Rinse', 'repeat', 'course', 'easy', 'say', 'type', 'horse', 'films', 'are', 'same', 'have', 'personal', 'experience', 'owning', 'raising', 'horses', 'therefore', 'feelings', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'different', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'raising', 'caring', 'years', 'Sort', 'how', 'dog', 'owners', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'dog', 'haters', 'less', 'drastic', 'hehe.Anyway', 'Moondance', 'Alexander', 'really', 'well-written', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'girl', 'immediately', 'incredible', 'amount', 'affection', 'horse', 'jump', 'out', 'front', 'bike', 'travelling', 'down', 'back', 'road', 'one', 'day', 'owner', 'horse', 'man', 'look', 'remarkably', 'similar', 'WWF', 'wrestler', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'have', 'SEEN', 'lately', 'just', 'like', '*this*', 'guy', 'so', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'everything', 'possibly', 'can', 'horse', 'inevitable', 'competition', 'place', 'course', 'arrogant', 'sassy', 'classmates', 'who', 'think', 'THEY', 'have', 'winning', 'horse', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'storyline', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'classmates', 'are', 'course', 'bad', 'guys', 'wan', 'see', 'fail', 'can', 'laugh', 'mock', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'trust', 'me.One', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'presentation', 'movie', 'REALLY', 'good', 'writing', 'may', 'be', 'predictable', 'way', 'scenery', 'many', 'segments', 'showing', 'girl', 'taking', 'care', 'horse', 'look', 'absolutely', 'astonishing', 'Great', 'job', 'there', 'Also', 'maybe', 'just', 'really', 'big', 'coincidence', 'girl', 'playing', 'role', 'Kay', 'Panabaker', 'identical', 'few', 'horse', 'caretakers', 'know', 'Interesting', 'there', '*perfect*', 'role', 'Also', 'slight', 'similarity', 'Judy', 'Garland', ""n't"", 'question', 'have', 'way', 'lighting', 'up', 'screen', 'when', 'smile.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'other', 'predictable', 'writing', 'actual', 'competition', 'place', 'end', 'based', 'horse', 'jumps', 'instead', 'actual', 'horse', 'race', 'not', 'very', 'dramatic', 'thrilling', 'fitting', 'conclusion', 'Instead', 'lacking', 'Other', 'same', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'times', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'one']",Moondance Alexander

A great job by Kay Panabaker as 15-yr-old Moondance who is put-down by her schoolmates. Don Johnson is fantastic as a has-been trainer. His believable character evokes empathy.This horse story (Checkers, a pinto this time) is like most horse stories. You gotta believe the horse will achieve success. Even with the typical super-horse ending, the story is a pleasant diversion into horse and stable life. Perhaps every young girl wishes to have a ""Checkers"" of their own. If they don't, this pleasant movie will give it to them.  But, this story is actually more about Moondance, the rider, than the horse.

If you or any members of your family love to watch a good, clean-cut, non-cussing, happy movie, then this is for you.  And, oh my gosh -- NO nudity!!!!!  WHAT?!!!!Moondance is a young girl, living in Colorado.  Doesn't have too many friends, marches to the beat of a different drummer.  Has an excellent attitude even though her dad has passed and like previously mentioned, she is not Miss Popular.Enter into her life a darling horse -- Checkers -- who is owned by Don Johnson.  Moondance and Checkers prove to be friends and you should see what life brings to them!!!!This is a great family movie -- which are hard-pressed to find these days.  You do not have to be a horse lover to be rooting for Checkers all the way!  What a beautiful animal -- he is so cool he has THREE movie star horses playing him in the movie.This movie is a tad predicatble, but is full of good vibes, drama, sentiment, and heart-warming situations.  There are classmates who treat Moondance badly, but this is a good lesson for the kids watching.  And for us older kids, Don Johnson is still VERY easy on the eyes.Grab some kleenex and some popcorn and enjoy!  I highly recommend this movie for ANY age.Thank you!Pam",5,SADDLE UP WITH SOME TISSUES AND POPCORN,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,1263,"['Moondance', 'AlexanderThis', 'sweet', 'family-oriented', 'little', 'movie', 'members', 'family', 'love', 'watch', 'good', 'clean-cut', 'non-cussing', 'happy', 'movie', 'then', 'oh', 'gosh', 'nudity', 'WHAT', 'Moondance', 'young', 'girl', 'living', 'Colorado', 'Does', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'many', 'friends', 'marches', 'beat', 'different', 'drummer', 'excellent', 'attitude', 'even', 'dad', 'passed', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'not', 'Miss', 'Popular.Enter', 'life', 'darling', 'horse', 'Checkers', 'who', 'owned', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Moondance', 'Checkers', 'prove', 'be', 'friends', 'should', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'are', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'days', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'horse', 'lover', 'be', 'rooting', 'Checkers', 'way', 'What', 'beautiful', 'animal', 'so', 'cool', 'THREE', 'movie', 'star', 'horses', 'playing', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'tad', 'predicatble', 'full', 'good', 'vibes', 'drama', 'sentiment', 'heart-warming', 'situations', 'are', 'classmates', 'who', 'treat', 'Moondance', 'badly', 'good', 'lesson', 'kids', 'watching', 'older', 'kids', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'still', 'VERY', 'easy', 'eyes.Grab', 'kleenex', 'popcorn', 'enjoy', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'ANY', 'age.Thank', 'Pam']",Moondance Alexander

Zwick,"[3, 6]","**1/2If you've already seen ""Black Beauty,"" ""National Velvet"" or ""My Friend Flicka,"" you might want to take a pass on ""Moondance Alexander,"" a wan girl-and-her-horse saga that doesn't even have the energy or conviction to rise above its own clich&eacute;s.Moondance is a ninth-grade social outcast who finds meaning and purpose in life when she spends the summer taking care of and learning to ride a horse owned by a cantankerous but lovable Pygmalion played by Don Johnson (think of it as an equine version of ""My Fair Lady,"" minus the songs and quality).  The first credibility obstacle we have to overcome is accepting the spunky and attractive Moondance as a girl who can't find herself a single friend (well, the two-legged type anyway).The paint-by-numbers screenplay comes replete with a miraculous horse healing, a bevy of Valley Girl elitists straight out of Central Casting, and a horse-jumping competition that has all the drama and suspense of a Tiddlywinks tournament in Oshkosh.Ah well, at least the movie boasts, in the person of Kay Panabaker, a young actress with a great deal of charm and potential.
