There were plenty of shows out there that were an hour long and sold their shows as complete seasons.(Examples: The Waltons, Little House on the Prairie) They did not feel the need to rip off the consumer by overcharging. It's like they want these shows not to sell, so they can stop releasing them right in the middle and consumers will be left with half a series and no hope of ever getting the rest. (like Love Boat). This was a good show with alot of happy memories associated with it - everyone wanted to be a part of the Bradford clan... I just don't know if it is worth it at this price.

As much as I love & have waited for Eight Is Enough to get released to DVD, I'm on the fence on buying this series' sets as not only is the cost exorbitant, but it stands to reason DVD-R format doesn't have the durability as standard DVD format.There is no reason in the world why Eight Is Enough can't have a DVD Video release like a legion of other much-loved classics have had over the years & with much success I might add. I'm very disappointed about this marketing ploy & won't cough up a small fortune for a half number of episodes per set.

Well they stopped producing anymore MTS dvd's probably because of poor sales.  I am afraid this might happen to Eight Is Enough.  If they weree able to put ""Charlie's Angels"", ""The Waltons"",""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" onto one dvd package, then they can do with EIE. They were all one hour shows.

I'm a big collector of all types of shows on dvd, but I've never in 10 years, EVER paid such a fee. Star Trek wasn't even this high. Eight Is Enough was a good show, but not this good.

Now, as prices are finally coming down on all dvd's, that one goes for about $15.00. I even see I Love Lucy for $9.00 per season at Walmart. But none of this.
