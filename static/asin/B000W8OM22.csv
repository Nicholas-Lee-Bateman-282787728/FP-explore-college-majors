Anyway, the actual documentary is excellent, with interviews from members of the band and many other people, many very intimately involved in the band. Chris Welch is featured quite a lot, and since he's someone who has followed the band since their start, he has a lot to say about them and most of it is interesting.The second DVD is a mix of interviews, still images, and a few music videos. I haven't watched all of the interviews yet, but what I did see was interesting. The music videos and still images are worth at least one look.At the current going price I think this is an excellent value for any serious Yes fan.",5,Excellent set of DVDs,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,729,"['When', 'ordered', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'had', 'streamed', 'Netflix', 'last', 'summer', 'Anyway', 'actual', 'documentary', 'excellent', 'interviews', 'members', 'band', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'many', 'very', 'intimately', 'involved', 'band', 'Chris', 'Welch', 'featured', 'quite', 'lot', 'someone', 'who', 'followed', 'band', 'start', 'lot', 'say', 'most', 'interesting.The', 'second', 'DVD', 'mix', 'interviews', 'still', 'few', 'music', 'videos', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'interviews', 'yet', 'what', 'did', 'see', 'was', 'interesting', 'music', 'videos', 'still', 'images', 'are', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'current', 'going', 'price', 'think', 'excellent', 'value', 'serious', 'Yes', 'fan']",Yes: Classic Artists

1107420,A1YCDZ4K4G0CN3,B000W8OM22,David Carlin,"[8, 14]","I've now revised my original review after watching both the interviews and supplemental material.  This is a great documentary of Yes and comparable to YesYears, the documentary filmed back in 1991.What makes this documentary unique is that we have many more individuals related to the Yes organization through the years including Mike Tate, Roy Clair (Sound Systems), Eddie Offord, Phil Carson, and a few of Yes's former managers (Except Brian Lane of course).  Peter Banks, original guitarist of Yes is featured here as well.  Bill Bruford is back again as well as all current members of Yes.This appears to be a British Production and very well done indeed.  The video generally interviews current and former members during each stage of development of Yes's Career.  Many of the same stories are told again, such as Bruford's account of early Yes travel when they drove themselves to the gigs then driving asleep at the wheel on the way back which led him to arrange alternate travel.Peter Banks for the first time recounts his firing from the band on video.  Steve Howe talks about his feelings on the 80's version of YES in detail and difficulty dealing with the dual guitar role on the Union Tour.  Chris Welch, Biographer of Yes and former Melody Maker writer recounts many memories of the band.  I don't really consider him an authority on YES exclusively, but he was more or less responsible for helping them gain exposure in England.  Since I've heard many of the same re-counting from most of the bandmembers, I enjoyed the blunt honesty of producer Eddie Offord and Mike Tate since they were closest to the organization during that time.Missing from the DVD are again, Patrick Moraz, Former Manager Brian Lane, however Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes are on here and give very detailed accounts of the recordings of Drama.  Trevor talks about touring with Yes in the 80's as well as the production of 90125 in which he was the producer.Supplemental Material is excellent, and there is also a small interview with Keith Emerson as he recounts a story of being asked to join Yes.There were some good moments where Mike Tate told the story of how Yes obtained their first decent PA system from IRON BUTTERFLY.  They generally signed over all publishing rights to obtain this.  Insane.  Bill Bruford on the other hand was told to give half his royalities to Alan White when he wanted to leave the band, due to Brian Lane.  This was brought up in Chris Welch's biography of Yes.I have in the past recommended that each current and former bandmember should write a detailed account of their own Yes Story including an in- depth look at Yes's song construction process as well as studio work.  Biographers have tried this but I believe they continually fail.  Chris Welch, Biographer of Yes ""Close To the Edge"", story of Yes for example in his video comments here, gives his negative criticism of such albums as Tales from Topographic Oceans and even the Relayer Album which were still two of Yes's most underrated work yet are still masterpieces, so I could not agree with some of his comments. I believe Chris Welch's over-exposure in this documentary actually hurts it, but I am not taking off points here because there are still many other views.Overall, an excellent addition to the YES DVD collection and I recommend it highly.",5,"Finally, some new Yes Material",1196899200,"12 6, 2007",2007,3333,"[""'ve"", 'now', 'revised', 'original', 'review', 'watching', 'interviews', 'supplemental', 'material', 'great', 'documentary', 'Yes', 'comparable', 'YesYears', 'documentary', 'filmed', 'back', '1991.What', 'documentary', 'unique', 'have', 'many', 'more', 'individuals', 'related', 'Yes', 'organization', 'years', 'including', 'Mike', 'Tate', 'Roy', 'Clair', 'Sound', 'Systems', 'Eddie', 'Offord', 'Phil', 'Carson', 'few', 'Yes', 'former', 'managers', 'Brian', 'Lane', 'course', 'Peter', 'Banks', 'original', 'guitarist', 'Yes', 'featured', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Bill', 'Bruford', 'back', 'again', 'as', 'well', 'current', 'members', 'Yes.This', 'be', 'British', 'Production', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'indeed', 'video', 'generally', 'current', 'former', 'members', 'stage', 'development', 'Yes', 'Career', 'Many', 'same', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'again', 'such', 'Bruford', 'account', 'early', 'Yes', 'travel', 'when', 'drove', 'gigs', 'then', 'driving', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'way', 'back', 'led', 'arrange', 'alternate', 'travel.Peter', 'Banks', 'first', 'time', 'firing', 'band', 'video', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'talks', 'feelings', '80', 'version', 'YES', 'detail', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'dual', 'guitar', 'role', 'Union', 'Tour', 'Chris', 'Welch', 'Biographer', 'Yes', 'former', 'Melody', 'Maker', 'writer', 'recounts', 'many', 'memories', 'band', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'consider', 'authority', 'YES', 'exclusively', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'responsible', 'helping', 'gain', 'exposure', 'England', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'many', 'same', 're-counting', 'most', 'bandmembers', 'enjoyed', 'blunt', 'honesty', 'producer', 'Eddie', 'Offord', 'Mike', 'Tate', 'were', 'closest', 'organization', 'time.Missing', 'DVD', 'are', 'again', 'Patrick', 'Moraz', 'Former', 'Manager', 'Brian', 'Lane', 'however', 'Trevor', 'Horn', 'Geoff', 'Downes', 'are', 'here', 'give', 'very', 'detailed', 'accounts', 'recordings', 'Drama', 'Trevor', 'talks', 'touring', 'Yes', '80', 'as', 'well', 'production', '90125', 'was', 'producer.Supplemental', 'Material', 'excellent', 'also', 'small', 'interview', 'Keith', 'Emerson', 'story', 'being', 'asked', 'join', 'Yes.There', 'were', 'good', 'moments', 'where', 'Mike', 'Tate', 'told', 'story', 'how', 'Yes', 'obtained', 'first', 'decent', 'PA', 'system', 'IRON', 'BUTTERFLY', 'generally', 'signed', 'publishing', 'rights', 'obtain', 'Insane', 'Bill', 'Bruford', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'told', 'give', 'royalities', 'Alan', 'White', 'when', 'wanted', 'leave', 'band', 'due', 'Brian', 'Lane', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'Chris', 'Welch', 'biography', 'Yes.I', 'have', 'past', 'recommended', 'current', 'former', 'bandmember', 'should', 'write', 'detailed', 'account', 'own', 'Yes', 'Story', 'including', 'in-', 'depth', 'look', 'Yes', 'song', 'construction', 'process', 'as', 'well', 'studio', 'work', 'Biographers', 'have', 'tried', 'believe', 'continually', 'fail', 'Chris', 'Welch', 'Biographer', 'Yes', 'Close', 'Edge', 'story', 'Yes', 'example', 'video', 'comments', 'here', 'negative', 'criticism', 'such', 'albums', 'Tales', 'Topographic', 'Oceans', 'even', 'Relayer', 'Album', 'were', 'still', 'two', 'Yes', 'most', 'underrated', 'work', 'yet', 'are', 'still', 'masterpieces', 'could', 'not', 'agree', 'comments', 'believe', 'Chris', 'Welch', 'over-exposure', 'documentary', 'actually', 'am', 'not', 'taking', 'off', 'points', 'here', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'other', 'views.Overall', 'excellent', 'addition', 'YES', 'DVD', 'collection', 'recommend', 'highly']",Yes: Classic Artists

It's great that John Brewer went to such lengths to be as evenhanded as possible in getting perspectives from most of the folks involved in Yes, past and present, but if you have no frame of reference for listening to their reminisces apart from a vague interest in the 60s or 70s, you'd be hard put to be interested in watching.It's also unfortunate that Trevor Rabin either declined or wasn't asked to be part of this program, apart from one archived video clip of an interview with him. The absence of interviews with  Tony Kaye, Billy Sherwood, Igor Khoroshev and Patrick Moraz  certainly make for big gaps in the narrative of the band's history, but as the guy who (for better or worse) rebooted Yes in the Eighties, the absence of personal reminisces from Rabin fairly glares at you.",3,Best appreciated if you're a fan......,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,965,"['..because', 'are', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'new', 'Yes', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'very', 'long', 'involved', 'interviews', 'band', 'music', 'very', 'few', 'examples', 'music', 'great', 'John', 'Brewer', 'went', 'such', 'lengths', 'be', 'as', 'evenhanded', 'possible', 'getting', 'perspectives', 'most', 'folks', 'involved', 'Yes', 'past', 'present', 'have', 'frame', 'reference', 'listening', 'reminisces', 'apart', 'vague', 'interest', '60s', '70s', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'put', 'be', 'interested', 'watching.It', 'also', 'unfortunate', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'declined', 'was', ""n't"", 'asked', 'be', 'part', 'program', 'apart', 'one', 'archived', 'video', 'clip', 'interview', 'absence', 'interviews', 'Tony', 'Kaye', 'Billy', 'Sherwood', 'Igor', 'Khoroshev', 'Patrick', 'Moraz', 'certainly', 'make', 'big', 'gaps', 'narrative', 'band', 'history', 'guy', 'who', 'better', 'worse', 'rebooted', 'Yes', 'Eighties', 'absence', 'personal', 'reminisces', 'Rabin', 'fairly']",Yes: Classic Artists
1107422,A35IF873PPAMFZ,B000W8OM22,"Jeff Barnaby ""Jeff Barnaby""","[4, 4]","This is absolutely the most definitive history available for YES that has been released to this date.  And for a YES fan, any YES fan, it is an absolute must-have.  Not having this would be the equivalent of not owning a copy of Fragile or Close to the Edge.  And like the music that came from those great albums, this documentary is long, thorough, detailed, honest, and very much worth having.So far there has been a lot of buzz comparing this video to YESYears, which is not an unfair comparison.  But this, and not merely because it is more recent, is a far superior, and more complete YES documentary. And for the record, this comes from somebody who thinks that the YESYears video is not all that bad.  But being completely honest, it was told with a somewhat one-sided and biased view towards the ""80's modern"" YES.  It also attempted to gloss over some of the tensions behind the band's history - all of this in support of the notion that Union was a happy, well-thought-out notion that the entire band really loved.The main reason that this one is better is because it was not produced to support any particular CD or tour and maintains a much more balanced view with regards to the band's history and the relationships therein.  YESYears has some great footage and some really good interviews.  But again, it is told from the perspective that the Union tour is the ultimate Be-All and End-All to the story YES.  This documentary spends much more time and goes into greater detail regarding the band's formation and history.  And not just regarding the musicians, but the managers, and engineers too.  There is a good chance that you will get to match some names to faces for the first time when watching this video.What elevates this documentary to the status of superb is the unbridled honesty that is put forth from both principle band members and others who've contributed along the way -- people such as Peter Banks, Trevor Horn, and Roger Dean.  Trevor Rabin's presence is minimal, a short interview with him talking about how he got started doing soundtracks - by giving guitar lessons to, of all people, Steven Segal.  Still, credit where credit is due, the albums from the Trevor Rabin years are talked about in detail by many of the band members and much of what they have to say is both interesting and surprising.  Steve Howe talks at length about touring with Asia and then listening to 90125 for the first time, then half-jokingly half-serious saying, ""they want to be like Asia."" But after talking for a while about both 90125 and Big Generator, one learns that Howe's opinion of 90125 is not as harsh as one might expect.  In fact watching the extended interview clips contained on the second disc reveals Steve Howe talking about listening to the song ""Changes"" many years later and admitting that the song elevates 90125 to the status of a legitimate YES album, despite its commercial nature.  This, for someone who got started with the Rabin era of YES, comes as a ringing endorsement of approval.  Of course his comments on Big Generator were exactly what one would expect - but still significant and actually kind of funny. Then again, Rick Wakeman talks about how he would have loved to have played on Big Generator against Trevor Rabin.  But then YES never was one to agree on things.Other memorable moments include Rick Wakeman talking about how much he hated the Union album an threw his copy of out the window of a moving car onto a Florida highway and wondering if it is sill there.  Later however he admits that as much as he loathed the record the 8-member tour was amazing.  Trevor Horn has a lot to say about the eighties. Bill Bruford talks cynically about recent YES projects as something that resembles a YES cover band where the members are present in mind and body only.  And of course, there is the endless debate over whether or not ""Tales from Topographic Oceans"" was musical brilliance or tonal trash.  Stories like this, and many others are what comprise this 204 minute documentary.  It does not feel that long at all.  Another mark of its qualityIt ends with some out-loud thinking about what YES will do next.  There are thoughts voiced about another album or a farewell tour.  There seems to be a general consensus that whatever they do should be something special and not merely another obligatory farewell tour to sell yet another concert video that can be followed up by yet another farewell tour.  Whatever YES decides, there is something poignant about the unmistakable feeling that, we may be nearing the end of the YES journey.  If that does indeed turn out to be true then watching this documentary should leave any YES fan out there with a sense that they left it all on the stage when they walked away.  And that is a good thing.",5,Complete and Definitive YES history,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,4793,"['absolutely', 'most', 'definitive', 'history', 'available', 'YES', 'been', 'released', 'date', 'YES', 'fan', 'YES', 'fan', 'absolute', 'must-have', 'Not', 'having', 'would', 'be', 'equivalent', 'not', 'owning', 'copy', 'Fragile', 'Close', 'Edge', 'music', 'came', 'great', 'albums', 'documentary', 'long', 'detailed', 'honest', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'having.So', 'far', 'been', 'lot', 'buzz', 'comparing', 'video', 'YESYears', 'not', 'unfair', 'comparison', 'not', 'merely', 'more', 'recent', 'far', 'superior', 'more', 'complete', 'YES', 'documentary', 'record', 'somebody', 'who', 'YESYears', 'video', 'not', 'bad', 'being', 'completely', 'honest', 'was', 'told', 'somewhat', 'one-sided', 'biased', 'view', '80', 'modern', 'YES', 'also', 'attempted', 'gloss', 'tensions', 'band', 'history', 'support', 'notion', 'Union', 'was', 'happy', 'well-thought-out', 'notion', 'entire', 'band', 'really', 'loved.The', 'main', 'reason', 'one', 'better', 'was', 'not', 'produced', 'support', 'particular', 'CD', 'tour', 'much', 'more', 'balanced', 'view', 'regards', 'band', 'history', 'relationships', 'therein', 'YESYears', 'great', 'footage', 'really', 'good', 'interviews', 'again', 'told', 'perspective', 'Union', 'tour', 'ultimate', 'Be-All', 'End-All', 'story', 'YES', 'documentary', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'greater', 'detail', 'regarding', 'band', 'formation', 'history', 'not', 'just', 'regarding', 'musicians', 'managers', 'engineers', 'too', 'good', 'chance', 'will', 'get', 'match', 'names', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'watching', 'video.What', 'documentary', 'status', 'superb', 'unbridled', 'honesty', 'put', 'forth', 'principle', 'band', 'members', 'others', 'who', ""'ve"", 'contributed', 'way', 'people', 'such', 'Peter', 'Banks', 'Trevor', 'Horn', 'Roger', 'Dean', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'presence', 'minimal', 'short', 'interview', 'talking', 'how', 'got', 'started', 'doing', 'soundtracks', 'giving', 'guitar', 'lessons', 'people', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'Still', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'albums', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'years', 'are', 'talked', 'detail', 'many', 'band', 'members', 'much', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'interesting', 'surprising', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'talks', 'length', 'touring', 'Asia', 'then', 'listening', '90125', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'half-jokingly', 'half-serious', 'saying', 'want', 'be', 'Asia', 'talking', 'while', '90125', 'Big', 'Generator', 'one', 'Howe', 'opinion', '90125', 'not', 'as', 'harsh', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'fact', 'watching', 'extended', 'interview', 'clips', 'contained', 'second', 'disc', 'reveals', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'talking', 'listening', 'song', 'Changes', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'admitting', 'song', '90125', 'status', 'legitimate', 'YES', 'album', 'commercial', 'nature', 'someone', 'who', 'got', 'started', 'Rabin', 'era', 'YES', 'ringing', 'endorsement', 'approval', 'course', 'comments', 'Big', 'Generator', 'were', 'exactly', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'still', 'significant', 'actually', 'kind', 'funny', 'Then', 'again', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'talks', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'played', 'Big', 'Generator', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'then', 'YES', 'never', 'was', 'one', 'agree', 'things.Other', 'memorable', 'moments', 'include', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'talking', 'how', 'much', 'hated', 'Union', 'album', 'threw', 'copy', 'window', 'moving', 'car', 'Florida', 'highway', 'wondering', 'sill', 'there', 'Later', 'however', 'as', 'much', 'loathed', 'record', '8-member', 'tour', 'was', 'amazing', 'Trevor', 'Horn', 'lot', 'say', 'eighties', 'Bill', 'Bruford', 'cynically', 'recent', 'YES', 'projects', 'something', 'YES', 'cover', 'band', 'where', 'members', 'are', 'present', 'mind', 'body', 'only', 'course', 'endless', 'debate', 'not', 'Tales', 'Topographic', 'Oceans', 'was', 'musical', 'brilliance', 'tonal', 'trash', 'Stories', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'what', 'comprise', '204', 'minute', 'documentary', 'not', 'feel', 'long', 'mark', 'qualityIt', 'out-loud', 'thinking', 'what', 'YES', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'are', 'thoughts', 'voiced', 'album', 'farewell', 'tour', 'be', 'general', 'consensus', 'do', 'should', 'be', 'something', 'special', 'not', 'merely', 'obligatory', 'farewell', 'sell', 'yet', 'concert', 'video', 'can', 'be', 'followed', 'up', 'yet', 'farewell', 'tour', 'YES', 'something', 'poignant', 'unmistakable', 'feeling', 'may', 'be', 'nearing', 'end', 'YES', 'journey', 'indeed', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'then', 'watching', 'documentary', 'should', 'leave', 'YES', 'fan', 'there', 'sense', 'left', 'stage', 'when', 'walked', 'away', 'good', 'thing']",Yes: Classic Artists

However, I just didn't find this as satisfying because I think it goes on a little too long. I would have liked to have seen some tighter editing. The extra unused footage could easily have become special features.If you're a hard core fan you will have heard much of this, but you might find a few new tidbits. The lack of a new interview with Trevor Rabin or any with Pat Moraz is more than offset by the inclusion of Tait, Offord and others close to the band over the years.

A better picture of the inner workings of the band are presented here than other documentaries.I still think YesYears is the best documentary on Yes, but this one definitely fills in a lot of holes and is easily the second best by a long way.Worth getting...",4,No music but some nice and revealing interviews,1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,931,"['production', 'par', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'Cream', 'bio-pics', 'CA', 'However', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'satisfying', 'think', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'tighter', 'editing', 'extra', 'unused', 'footage', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'become', 'special', 'features.If', ""'re"", 'hard', 'core', 'fan', 'will', 'have', 'heard', 'much', 'might', 'find', 'few', 'new', 'tidbits', 'lack', 'new', 'interview', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'Pat', 'Moraz', 'more', 'offset', 'inclusion', 'Tait', 'Offord', 'others', 'close', 'band', 'years', 'Bill', 'Bruford', 'Chris', 'Squire', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'are', 'generally', 'most', 'entertaining', 'most', 'willing', 'share', 'details', 'better', 'picture', 'inner', 'workings', 'band', 'are', 'presented', 'here', 'other', 'documentaries.I', 'still', 'think', 'YesYears', 'best', 'documentary', 'Yes', 'one', 'definitely', 'lot', 'holes', 'easily', 'second', 'best', 'long', 'way.Worth', 'getting']",Yes: Classic Artists

Very well put together and well done in terms of quality of product and packaging.  My only regrets are that not all the members are interviewed and I dont know why.There may be simple reasons why but I would have liked to hear from Tony Kaye or Trevor Rabin for instance.  Also I dont remember Patrick Moraz either since it has been awhile now since I watched the DVD.The rehearsal footage is ok but the sound is not the greatest but still, I enjoyed it.  Hope they release the Going For The One and Tormato rehearsal footage I have seen on YouTube one day with better quality of image and sound.The part I really did not like is the photo section which moves so fast you can hardly get a chance to take in the images which are great.  You have to watch them several times or pause them with great precision.11/22/2013-  I have watched this more times than I can remember its that good.  So glad this was done by Mr Brewer and Mr Welch and I wish I could figure out a way to get them to autograph it for me.

Other than that, I highly reccomend that all YES fans purchase this DVD. It is, in my opinion, the best documentry on the band that has been made. It comes as a 2 disc set. The first is a complete history of the band with great interviews. The second disc contains extra interviews, 3 video's, and a picture gallery.

1107429,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B000W8OM22,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[3, 5]","Here's a double DVD of a very detailed history on the group Yes.  This first DVD goes on for over 3 and a half hours.  That's a lot of ""blah-blah-blah"" to have to sit through.  You'd have to be a very big fan of Yes to want to savor every word being said here.  And then you get a second DVD with even more ""even less interesting"" dialogue plus you get to see some videos (unfortunately cropped for widescreen instead of their original full screen format).I love Yes.  But, I enjoy the YesYears DVD better for a few good reasons.  YesYears is one DVD and it only runs about 94 minutes.  YesYears sticks to very important information about Yes so that even the non-Yes fan may capture interest in Yes.And, what's very important about the difference between this Classic Artists release and YesYears is that YesYears has a much better video quality.  This DVD video quality is rather fuzzy and muddy.  So it's way too long of an eyesore to have to sit through.  Especially twice or more.I've rented these two DVD's of Yes: Classic Artists and I just wasn't too impressed.  After I watched them, I then watched my copy of YesYears.  YesYears is definitely more interesting and looks very good on DVD.  Much higher quality picture and sound.  It may be out of print now, but if you're a serious Yes Fan, you should look for it used somewhere.  However, I doubt you'll ever find it easily.  No true Yes fan that has it would give it up, I'm sure.",3,"Although the box looks nice, the overall package isn't as good as YesYears",1202601600,"02 10, 2008",2008,1441,"['Here', 'double', 'DVD', 'very', 'detailed', 'history', 'group', 'Yes', 'first', 'DVD', '3', 'half', 'hours', 'lot', 'blah-blah-blah', 'have', 'sit', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'Yes', 'want', 'savor', 'word', 'being', 'said', 'here', 'then', 'get', 'second', 'DVD', 'even', 'more', 'even', 'less', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'get', 'see', 'videos', 'unfortunately', 'cropped', 'widescreen', 'instead', 'original', 'full', 'screen', 'format', '.I', 'love', 'Yes', 'enjoy', 'YesYears', 'DVD', 'better', 'few', 'good', 'reasons', 'YesYears', 'one', 'DVD', 'only', '94', 'minutes', 'YesYears', 'very', 'important', 'information', 'Yes', 'that', 'even', 'non-Yes', 'fan', 'may', 'capture', 'interest', 'Yes.And', 'what', 'very', 'important', 'difference', 'Classic', 'Artists', 'release', 'YesYears', 'YesYears', 'much', 'better', 'video', 'quality', 'DVD', 'video', 'quality', 'rather', 'fuzzy', 'muddy', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'eyesore', 'have', 'sit', 'Especially', 'twice', 'more.I', ""'ve"", 'rented', 'two', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'Classic', 'Artists', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'watched', 'then', 'watched', 'copy', 'YesYears', 'YesYears', 'definitely', 'more', 'interesting', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'Much', 'higher', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'may', 'be', 'print', 'now', ""'re"", 'serious', 'Yes', 'Fan', 'should', 'look', 'used', 'somewhere', 'However', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'find', 'easily', 'No', 'true', 'Yes', 'fan', 'would', 'give', 'up', ""'m"", 'sure']",Yes: Classic Artists

1107431,A25JHXYK10F0A6,B000W8OM22,"Thomas D. Ryan ""American Hit Network""","[38, 41]","One thing you could never accuse Yes of is restraint. The same band that gave us double albums consisting of four song titles has now released their `authorized' biography, and it is almost as overwhelmingly self-indulgent as ""Tales of Topographic Oceans"" - but I wouldn't want it any other way. I loved Yes in the `70s. They were such a unique animal that they stood apart from virtually anything else on the scene at that time, and to be sure, no other band ever really approached their combination of intelligence and overkill. The Roger Dean-designed cover for this package promises something extraordinary, as if the old band had somehow turned back the time machine to the days of their classic era. Of course, that would be impossible, but there are elements of this collection that revive old sentiments for the band most responsible for creating `progressive rock'.Except for background and severely edited bits, the first disk contains virtually no music at all. Instead, the disk rambles on for three and one-half hours of interviews with virtually every bandmember. You could play ""The Yes Album"" six times in the amount of time it takes to view the interviews on disk one. ""Gone With the Wind"" is concise in comparison, but the interviews are nonetheless fascinating. Once you get past the visual image of how each member has aged (Chris Squire was almost unrecognizable to me), it becomes apparent that 200+ minutes of interviews is appropriate for a band known for its bombast and sprawling vision. Each member is extraordinarily honest and candid in their recollections, and amusing as well. The video is edited extremely well, switching from person to person with a continuity that allows us to see various aspects of the same story. It is wonderful to see each member speak with candor, and fans will get to know each bandmember in ways that were previously impossible.As if that weren't enough, a second disk contains an additional hour or so of edited interview footage, which is complete overkill. Comparatively, the music content is paltry, with three vintage videos (that are hilarious in retrospect) and some low-tech, extraneous rehearsal footage dating from 1996. In short, the entire package revolves around whether or not you care to hear the bandmembers recount the convoluted story of one of rock and roll's most tumultuous bands. It is long (and long-winded), but it is also a wondrous story.
