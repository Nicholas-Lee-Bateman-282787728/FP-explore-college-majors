Directed by Chris Columbus, Nine Months follows a young unmarried couple who about to bring a baby into the world. Grant is charming as always and his non-stop flustering is always engaging. Julianne Moore is great as well, I like in these kind of films. Robin Williams, Tom Arnold, Jeff Goldblum, and Joan Cusack also star.

387299,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6303890458,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 1]","I ask you again.  Where has this style of comedy gone?  I applaud director Chris Columbus for keeping the spirit behind this film alive for so long, but when everyone else goes the way of sexual humor and bathroom jokes, there is only so much you can do.  I miss this type of comedy.  This film used to be on my top Ten List back in 1995.  I used to watch it over and over again, never getting enough of Robin Williams and Tom Arnold (is that blasphemy now?).  They were comic geniuses at the peak of their careers.  Everything just seemed to fit into place with this film.  The story was unique and personable, the humor was a cut above and the characters ... well ... the characters were ... decent.As I watch this film now, older, wiser and chalk full of more films, I think that is my only gripe about the film was the characters.  There were some that worked perfectly.  Goldblum can do wrong, Williams is a stitch (doctor humor), and Arnold seemed to carry his own weight (ok, I honestly will stop now).  The only two I had trouble with were Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore.  All right, I will give Grant the credit that this was one of his first big Hollywood films, but he just couldn't seem to hit his cues as well.  When I was younger, I didn't notice it as much as I did this time around.  He was trying to do Python when he should have just been himself.  Not to worry Grant fans, he gets better with age (minus Edge of Reason).  What was Julianne Moore doing in this movie?  I don't know how I missed it before, but she really doesn't act in this movie.  Her face gives some expressions, but her body does nothing but stand there.  It was really obvious this viewing than it was nearly 10 years ago.  Looking back, it wasn't one of her early films, so maybe she just wasn't comfortable.  I remember when she tried humor in Laws of Attraction, she was really out of her element there.  Perhaps it just isn't her genre.  Thankfully, Williams, Goldblum, and Arnold round out the cast that conveniently anchor this film to the ground.Do you know what I loved most about this film?  The physical comedy.  The fallings, the fake fights, and the awkward hits all seemed to fit very well in this film.  The timing was exact and the laughs could still be heard from our living room.  While I think in another ten years this film will be hard to watch, it was good to see it one last time before it died.  It isn't a landmark 90s comedy, but what it does it does very well.  Columbus was King of this genre, with other hits like Adventures in Babysitting and Home Alone, he redefined and built his name upon comedy.  Whenever I think of films from the early 90s that stand out, I have no doubt that Columbus has his hand somewhere in it.  His work behind the camera in Nine Months is no exception.  He seems to be a step ahead of the actors, always knowing where the camera should go and be placed so that he can capture the exact feeling of the actors.  He is a genuine craftsman that could build a simple task and make it into a blockbuster.Overall, I was still impressed with this film.  While it didn't quite carry the same punch as it did when I watched it in 1995, it did make want to revisit some of Robin Williams's older films and laugh like I did when I was young.  This is a genre that redefined an entire generation.  This is my golden years of Hollywood, and it is good to see that years later, pulled from a Video Store vault, that it still has some of its momentum remaining.  I cannot ask anything more than for you to check this film out when you have the chance.  If anything for Robin Williams performance, but I have this deep feeling that you will enjoy even more.Grade: *** out of *****",3,"If it's not one thing, it's your mother.",1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,3709,"['ask', 'again', 'Where', 'style', 'comedy', 'gone', 'applaud', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'keeping', 'spirit', 'film', 'alive', 'so', 'long', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'way', 'sexual', 'humor', 'bathroom', 'jokes', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'miss', 'type', 'comedy', 'film', 'used', 'be', 'top', 'Ten', 'List', 'back', '1995', 'used', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'never', 'getting', 'enough', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'blasphemy', 'now', 'were', 'comic', 'geniuses', 'peak', 'careers', 'Everything', 'just', 'seemed', 'fit', 'place', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'unique', 'personable', 'humor', 'was', 'cut', 'characters', 'well', 'characters', 'were', 'decent.As', 'watch', 'film', 'now', 'older', 'wiser', 'chalk', 'full', 'more', 'films', 'think', 'only', 'gripe', 'film', 'was', 'characters', 'were', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'Goldblum', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'Williams', 'stitch', 'doctor', 'humor', 'Arnold', 'seemed', 'carry', 'own', 'weight', 'ok', 'honestly', 'will', 'stop', 'now', 'only', 'two', 'had', 'trouble', 'were', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'right', 'will', 'give', 'Grant', 'credit', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hit', 'cues', 'well', 'When', 'was', 'younger', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'time', 'around', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'Python', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'Not', 'worry', 'Grant', 'fans', 'better', 'age', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'What', 'was', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'doing', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'missed', 'really', ""n't"", 'act', 'movie', 'face', 'expressions', 'body', 'nothing', 'stand', 'there', 'was', 'really', 'obvious', 'viewing', 'was', 'nearly', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'Looking', 'back', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'early', 'films', 'maybe', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'comfortable', 'remember', 'when', 'tried', 'humor', 'Laws', 'Attraction', 'was', 'really', 'element', 'there', 'Perhaps', 'just', ""n't"", 'genre', 'Thankfully', 'Williams', 'Goldblum', 'Arnold', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'conveniently', 'film', 'ground.Do', 'know', 'what', 'loved', 'most', 'film', 'physical', 'comedy', 'fallings', 'fake', 'fights', 'awkward', 'hits', 'seemed', 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'timing', 'was', 'exact', 'laughs', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'heard', 'living', 'room', 'think', 'ten', 'years', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'died', ""n't"", 'landmark', '90s', 'comedy', 'what', 'very', 'well', 'Columbus', 'was', 'King', 'genre', 'other', 'hits', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', 'Home', 'Alone', 'redefined', 'built', 'name', 'comedy', 'Whenever', 'think', 'films', 'early', '90s', 'stand', 'have', 'doubt', 'Columbus', 'hand', 'somewhere', 'work', 'camera', 'Nine', 'Months', 'exception', 'be', 'step', 'ahead', 'actors', 'always', 'knowing', 'where', 'camera', 'should', 'go', 'be', 'placed', 'so', 'can', 'capture', 'exact', 'feeling', 'actors', 'genuine', 'craftsman', 'could', 'build', 'simple', 'task', 'make', 'blockbuster.Overall', 'was', 'still', 'impressed', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'carry', 'same', 'punch', 'did', 'when', 'watched', '1995', 'did', 'make', 'want', 'revisit', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'older', 'films', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'genre', 'redefined', 'entire', 'generation', 'golden', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'good', 'see', 'years', 'later', 'pulled', 'Video', 'Store', 'vault', 'still', 'momentum', 'remaining', 'can', 'not', 'ask', 'anything', 'more', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'when', 'have', 'chance', 'anything', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'performance', 'have', 'deep', 'feeling', 'will', 'enjoy', 'even', 'more.Grade', '***', '*****']",Nine Months VHS
387300,A1534MBU6VJXYN,6303890458,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[0, 2]","I've seen just about every great comedy known to man, from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to ""Animal House"" to ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" to the more recent ""American Pie"" series. They are all classic comedies. And so is ""Nine Months"", a heartwarming comedy about love and pregnancy and the ups and downs that go along with it.Hugh Grant turns in a charming performance as Samuel Faulkner, a child physciatrist who has everything a man could possibly want -a porsche, a beautiful and an adoring girlfriend, Rebecca (Julianne Moore). But things soon go awry when Moore becomes pregnant, throwing Grant into a tizzy and forcing him to change his life completely. Heartbreak and hilarity, ending in a warm and happy way typical of today's films.There are many hilarious moments in this film, such as the fist fight in the toy store with Arnie the Dinosaur and the delivery scene (one of the funniest climaxes in any comedy). But the thing that makes ""Nine Months"" really work is the strong supporting cast. Joan Cusack and Tom Arnold are perfect as Sam and Rebecca's overbearing but well meaning (and also expecting) friends. In fact, Tom Arnold is so likable in this film that it may force some people to forgive him for being the obnoxious jerk he is in reality (sorry, Tom). Jeff Goldblum, albeit in a small role, turns in a excellent performance as Sam's bachelor friend Sean, who helps Samuel cope with the problems he faces. But the best of the bunch is, without a doubt, Robin Williams. Playing Dr. Kosevich, a Russian dcotor about to make his first human delivery. Williams is hilarious especially when he mangles the English language.If you're looking for nonstop laughs in a comedy that delivers, please do yourself a favor and pick up ""Nine Months"". Trust me, you will certainly not regret it. (Bonus: while there are no extra features, at the end, you get to see what all the stars look like as babies. Boy, Jeff Goldblum still had the same haircut).",5,One Of The Funniest Movies I've Ever Seen,1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,1962,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'great', 'comedy', 'known', 'man', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', 'Animal', 'House', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'more', 'recent', 'American', 'Pie', 'series', 'are', 'classic', 'comedies', 'so', 'Nine', 'Months', 'heartwarming', 'comedy', 'love', 'pregnancy', 'ups', 'downs', 'go', 'along', 'it.Hugh', 'Grant', 'charming', 'performance', 'Samuel', 'Faulkner', 'child', 'physciatrist', 'who', 'everything', 'man', 'could', 'possibly', 'want', '-a', 'porsche', 'beautiful', 'adoring', 'girlfriend', 'Rebecca', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'things', 'soon', 'go', 'awry', 'when', 'Moore', 'pregnant', 'throwing', 'Grant', 'tizzy', 'forcing', 'change', 'life', 'completely', 'Heartbreak', 'hilarity', 'ending', 'warm', 'happy', 'way', 'typical', 'today', 'are', 'many', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'film', 'such', 'fist', 'fight', 'toy', 'store', 'Arnie', 'Dinosaur', 'delivery', 'scene', 'one', 'funniest', 'climaxes', 'comedy', 'thing', 'Nine', 'Months', 'really', 'work', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'are', 'perfect', 'Sam', 'Rebecca', 'overbearing', 'well', 'meaning', 'also', 'expecting', 'friends', 'fact', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'so', 'likable', 'film', 'may', 'force', 'people', 'forgive', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'jerk', 'reality', 'sorry', 'Tom', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'albeit', 'small', 'role', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Sam', 'bachelor', 'friend', 'Sean', 'who', 'Samuel', 'cope', 'problems', 'best', 'bunch', 'doubt', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Playing', 'Dr.', 'Kosevich', 'Russian', 'dcotor', 'make', 'first', 'human', 'delivery', 'Williams', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'when', 'English', 'language.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'nonstop', 'laughs', 'comedy', 'delivers', 'please', 'do', 'favor', 'pick', 'up', 'Nine', 'Months', 'Trust', 'will', 'certainly', 'not', 'regret', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'end', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'stars', 'look', 'babies', 'Boy', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'still', 'had', 'same', 'haircut']",Nine Months VHS

387302,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,6303890458,"A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com ""What should ...","[4, 7]","The Question:How can Hugh Grant, Julianne Moore, Robin Williams, Tom Arnold, Jeff Goldbloom and Joan Cusack all be in the same movie and it is still not incredible?The Answer:Predictable writing, easy puns, rehashed characters and less than inspired performances.I am a fan of Grant, Williams and Goldbloom, but in ""Nine Months"" I saw the same personalities they have in many movies.Grant was the same cute, surprised, humble and step-behind Brit. It is a great personality, and appropriate for the movie, but he was given so little good material to work with that I could barely muster a smile. His struggle with leaving youth behind to take on the responsibilities of fatherhood asks important questions, but the screenwriters used formulas rather than insight to create the conundrum's complexities. It felt as if no real fathers were involved in scripting.Unlike Danny Kaye, Robin Williams is unable to replay the naive foreign speaker with freshness every time we see him. His doctor sounded like a mix of Dr. Nick Riviera on the Simpsons and Williams as the Russian in ""Moscow Over the Hudson."" His lines were largely mispronunciations of female anatomy. The writers overdid the gag, and it grew tiresome by the movie's end.Goldbloom was the diehard bachelor who loves his independence. He is philosophical about in that Goldbloom way. It gives depth to the movie as he serves as a vehicle for Grant's conscience. Goldbloom is living and promoting the lifestyle Grant must leave to be a good father. Again, Goldbloom presents in a way that will remind viewers of him in ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Fly.""Moore is shown as a stereotypical mom-to-be. The emotional mood swings are followed by lines heard in every movie involving childbirth. As a stronger part of her character, when considering abortion, she knows that she cannot after experiencing the life inside her. The writers didn't let it become a political or even moral dilemma, but let the story tell itself here.I liked the movie for its easiness. Despite the routine performances by otherwise incredible actors, and the flaccid writing and directing, it turns out to be a nice, pleasing movie. I would not buy ""Nine Months,"" but I would rent it.

And, Tom Arnold plays the loud-mouth, annoying guy that he often plays.  Robin Williams does his off the wall foreign act.  Yes, it's typecasting, but so what.  They are all quite funny.  Yes, the storyline is predictable, you know how it will end, but so what?  It is still really enjoyable.  There is a lot of physical humor that had me laughing out loud.

387310,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,6303890458,L.A. Scene,"[4, 7]","By today's standards, when it comes to Romantic-Comedy films, Hugh Grant is considered to be in the top of his class when it comes to leading man roles.  However, one thing that is often overlooked is that Grant can also pull off physical comedy.  The 1995 movie ""Nine Months"" combines the best of both world - outstanding Romantic-Comedy with physical comedy mixed in.  In 1995, Hugh Grant was an emerging actor who had just been in the movie ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"".  His follow-up would be ""Nine Months"" and would go a long way to building Hugh Grant's star power.  However, Grant is not alone - he has an outstanding supporting cast in Julianne Moore, Tom Arnold, Joan Cusack, Jeff Goldblum, and Robin Williams to make ""Nine Months"" a most entertaining movie.In ""Nine Months"", Hugh Grant stars as Samuel Faulkner - a San Francisco Child Psychologist who is very happy with his life.  He is enjoying the ""yuppie"" style of life with his Dance Instructor girlfriend Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore).  Samuel's life is turned upside down when Rebecca tells him that she is pregnant.  Along the way, Samuel and Rebecca become friendly with Marty and Gail Dwyer (played superbly by Tom Arnold and Joan Cusack).  Marty and Gail are experienced parents with three daughters - with a fourth one on the way.  Marty and Gail provide some overbearing, yet emotional support to Samuel and Rebecca during the pregnancy.  However, while Rebecca is very enthusiastic about the pregnancy, Samuel is not.  He is very upset about the baby disrupting his ""perfect"" life.  Samuel becomes negligent and doesn't provide support to Rebecca when needed - prompting Rebecca to move-out and move-in with Marty and Gail.  Eventually, Samuel sees a video of a sonogram and has a big change of heart.  After trying to enjoy bachelorhood, he soon realizes what he wants is a family.  Samuel eventually is able to win Rebecca back - and even marries her.  The movie leads to an exciting climax where both Rebecca and Gail give birth in a hilarious delivery room scene.While I enjoyed Hugh Grant in this movie (especially his physical comedy moments), the person who really surprised me in this movie was Tom Arnold.  Prior to this movie, I really wasn't a fan of Tom Arnold.  However, I think Tom Arnold was the perfect guy to play the overbearing Marty Dwyer.  Arnold's personality was the right one to play an overbearing character.  Tom Arnold also provides some terrific physical comedy moments.  Probably the movie's funniest scene involves Marty getting into a fight with ""Arnie the Dinosaur"" (Arnie was a definite poke at ""Barney The Dinosaur"", but had a bit more of an evil side).  While the scene was pretty predictable that Marty would end up fighting Arnie, it is still one you will watch over and over again.  There are also other terrific Tom Arnold moments - including the fight that Marty and Samuel get in the delivery room when Rebecca and Gail go into labor.  In addition to the physical comedy moments,  Tom Arnold really came across as very believable in terms of playing the ""experienced parent"".As for Joan Cusack, I am not a big fan of hers - but I do think she was the right fit to play Gail Dwyer.  She is the perfect head-strong compliment to her on-screen husband, Tom Arnold.Robin Williams has a supporting role in this film.  He plays Dr. Kosovich - a wacky Russian OB/GYN doctor.  While I did like the fact that there was a wacky OB/GYN in this movie, I didn't find Dr. Kosovich's character to be very enjoyable.  In fact, I found his character to be annoying.  This isn't a knock on Williams - I think he plays the character well.  I just found Dr. Kosovich to get on my nerves.Jeff Goldblum also has a supporting role in this film.  Jeff plays ""Sean"" - who is Samuel's best-friend and Gail's brother.  Sean is Samuel's ""ultimate bachelor"" friend who on the surface seems to really enjoy his single-life.  Goldblum was a good fit to play Sean.  While I enjoyed the character of Sean, I was very disappointed that there weren't more scenes involving Sean.  In fact, I am very disappointed when Sean is not a part of the very exciting finale of the movie.One flaw I have with the Hugh Grant character is the whole Child Psychologist angle.  There was a big irony that Samuel - who was completely out of element around children (in the beginning of the movie) was a Child Psychologist.  While there are a couple of mildly humorous scenes with Samuel and a child patient, I think the writers could have exploited this angle a lot better.  Instead, this whole ironic angle is essentially dropped in the second-half of the movie.Ultimately, the ending of this movie is worth watching.  Although there is a certain predictability about the end, it is still a scene you are going to watch over and over.  The car ride to the hospital is hilarious - especially the old lady who gets picked up along the way because her husband is having a heart-attack.  Once they get to the hospital, Samuel and Rebecca discover Marty and Gail are there.  Of course Marty has brought his video camera along - and eventually that leads to a confrontation between Samuel and Marty.The other thing worth noting is their is some terrific music in this movie.  Director Chris Columbus knows how to compliment the story with the right music at the right time.  Most notable tracks are Van Morrison's ""These are the Days"" (which sadly did not make it on the soundtrack) and Marvin Gaye's ""Let's Get it On"".Overall, this might not be a movie with the strongest storyline - but it is a movie that will entertain.  Much of the strength of this movie will be with the Hugh Grant and Tom Arnold characters.  A Highly recommended movie.",4,Good Mix of Romantic and Physical Comedy,1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,5706,"['today', 'standards', 'when', 'Romantic-Comedy', 'films', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'considered',

387313,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,6303890458,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[1, 2]","There are many other hilarious quotes in this movie, mainly from Robin Williams, in a fantastically Russian role. But most of them are way too rude, and Amazon would be no doubt getting their red pen out. And I'm not having that happen to my review.This movie is typically predictable, of this sort of chick-flick, women only film. With a lot of actors (Hugh Grant, Julianne Moore, Tom Arnold, Joan Cusack and Jeff Goldblum, the latter playing their usual kooky parts), you feel swamped by the stars, but yet, who is the true main star? Robin Williams. He is hilarious, as soon as he appears. The movie is worth watching for him alone, and you fill be in fits of laughter, by the finale, the double-labour scene.For a guy who dumps his girlfriend, and then decides he wants her BACK, Samuel (Hugh Grant) doesn't seem to try to hard! But then again, neither does Rebecca. But then, I'd let Samuel do all the chasing personally! Jeff Goldblum plays his 'best friend', and manages to throw in any of his old nonsense (that makes sense to him, but to no one else) and it works in the script. I don't think so. He didn't have much to do in the movie, one minute he's telling Samuel to be with Rebecca, embrace fatherhood, and then he's telling him that he dumped his girlfriend because she wanted his &quot;essence&quot;. Uh-huh. (Not necessarily in that order, but you know what I mean)Tom Arnold plays a very over-the-top role, alongside his baby-making machine, played by Joan Cusack. Oh, I'm sorry, you mean that's his wife?! Could've fooled me! As Samuel so rightly says, you need a licence to drive a car, but anyone can become a parent, and sometimes a very lousy one. I'm not saying that Tom &amp; Joan's character are lousy parents (there's not much interaction between them and the kids), it's just - she must have spent half her married life being pregnant!Why was Hugh Grant given the main billing for this movie? To me, this will always be a Robin Williams. He's so funny, especially when he gets his words muddled, or says the completely wrong thing, and still manages a big cheesy grin. And the Russian accent never falters!There's nothing in the way of extras, except a trailer. For once, I watched the trailer AFTER the movie (nyah nyah) - I've seen this movie so often, the trailer didn't particularly appeal to me. But then I noticed scenes that were obviously cut from the movie, IN the trailer! If you're gonna cut scenes from the movie people, take them OUT of the trailer too! It just ruins it. You see what could have been a potentially funny scene, but it's no longer there.This is a terrific movie, although as one reviewer said, it's enough to put any guy over to the other side! But no film will put women off giving birth, because it's not real! Although it's hilariously funny!",3,&quot;You have a girl.

This is the same, except its extreme hilarity is balanced perfectly with plot to create a thoroughly entertaining comedy experience.I'm sure somebody has gone through the whole description of this movie in great detail, so I won't do it again.  If you have seen other Hugh Grant movies, you know how his comedy works: his sassy come backs and comments come at full force through out the movie, and blend excelently with Robin Williams' accent, (he plays a newly immigrated Russian), mistakes in word choice, and physical humor.  Add that to Tom Arnold's role as a man who is a complete jerk on the surface, but really full of heart, and Jeff Goldblum, who flings his funny comments in without skipping a beat, and you have a comedic team which will keep you in stitches from start to finish.I think this is one of those movies great to watch curled up on the couch on a Sunday afternoon, or just as an evening treat, but whenever you watch it, it is a movie not to be missed.",5,The best romantic comedy ever,1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,1133,"['have', 'watched', 'good', 'number', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'have', 'noticed', 'often', 'have', 'great', 'plot', 'entertain', 'hilarious', 'antics', 'same', 'extreme', 'hilarity', 'balanced', 'perfectly', 'plot', 'create', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'experience.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'somebody', 'gone', 'whole', 'description', 'movie', 'great', 'detail', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'again', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'movies', 'know', 'how', 'comedy', 'works', 'sassy', 'come', 'backs', 'comments', 'come', 'full', 'force', 'movie', 'blend', 'excelently', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'accent', 'newly', 'immigrated', 'Russian', 'mistakes', 'word', 'choice', 'physical', 'humor', 'Add', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'complete', 'jerk', 'surface', 'really', 'full', 'heart', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'who', 'funny', 'comments', 'skipping', 'beat', 'have', 'comedic', 'team', 'will', 'keep', 'stitches', 'start', 'finish.I', 'think', 'one', 'movies', 'great', 'watch', 'curled', 'up', 'couch', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'just', 'evening', 'treat', 'whenever', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Nine Months VHS
387319,A2MJKH6DQIKTM3,6303890458,Robert Amsel,"[2, 4]","The term ""uneven"" comedy could have been coined to describe ""Nine Months."" The first two-thirds of the movie (with the exception of Robin Williams' scene in which he plays an unbelievably inept Russian OB/GYN doctor) is the typical romantic comedy stuff you'll find on any average or below-average sitcom. Hugh Grant fusses and frets about being a father and showing commitment when his lover Julianne Moore gets pregnant.  She dumps him, and he tries to win her back, the result of which is a foregone conclusion.  The last one-third of the movie, however, is energetic and is played for all-out farce as Hugh drives Julianne to the hospital for her delivery, creating havoc (and presumably enough lawsuits to bankrupt him into the 22nd Century, not that this is ever mentioned) along the way, but do the laughs generated excuse the first two-thirds of the film?  I imagine certain women who enjoy sitcoms and pregnancy might find this movie heart-warming and ""real"", but the rest of us will be stuck with not overly convincing characterizations, despite an overall talented cast.  Joan Cusack, as usual, rises above the material, and Robin Williams in a manic world all his own as the nutty doctor generates laughs.  Jeff Goldblum gives an impeccable performance in what is generally a thankless role as Hugh's best friend.  And between you and me, Tom Arnold (and NOT between you and I), please buy an English grammar book and learn the difference between objective and subjective case pronouns.  (I don't entirely blame the screenwriter/director Columbus, who might buy one as well, since I've seen Mr. Arnold butcher English on talk shows.)  As for Arnold's performance, he does the best he can do with a weak script that calls for him to be callous and obnoxious one moment and incredibly sensitive the next.  Julianne Moore, one of our best actresses, tries heroically to bring emotional truth to her stereotypical role, and Hugh Grant relies on his stuttering boyish charm to breeze through the mishmash, but his tearful moments are less convincing, but how much can the poor guy do when he's working with a cardboard cutout?",2,The Gestation Period Seemed More Like Nine Years,1055808000,"06 17, 2003",2003,2133,"['term', 'uneven', 'comedy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'coined', 'describe', 'Nine', 'Months', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'exception', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'scene', 'unbelievably', 'inept', 'Russian', 'OB/GYN', 'doctor', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'stuff', ""'ll"", 'find', 'average', 'below-average', 'sitcom', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'fusses', 'frets', 'being', 'father', 'showing', 'commitment', 'when', 'lover', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'pregnant', 'dumps', 'win', 'back', 'result', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'last', 'one-third', 'movie', 'however', 'energetic', 'played', 'all-out', 'farce', 'Hugh', 'Julianne', 'hospital', 'delivery', 'creating', 'havoc', 'presumably', 'enough', 'lawsuits', 'bankrupt', '22nd', 'Century', 'not', 'ever', 'mentioned', 'way', 'do', 'laughs', 'generated', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'imagine', 'certain', 'women', 'who', 'enjoy', 'sitcoms', 'pregnancy', 'might', 'find', 'movie', 'heart-warming', 'real', 'rest', 'will', 'be', 'stuck', 'not', 'overly', 'convincing', 'characterizations', 'overall', 'talented', 'cast', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'usual', 'rises', 'material', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'manic', 'world', 'own', 'nutty', 'doctor', 'generates', 'laughs', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'impeccable', 'performance', 'what', 'generally', 'thankless', 'role', 'Hugh', 'best', 'friend', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'NOT', 'please', 'buy', 'English', 'grammar', 'book', 'learn', 'difference', 'objective', 'subjective', 'case', 'pronouns', 'do', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'blame', 'screenwriter/director', 'Columbus', 'who', 'might', 'buy', 'one', 'as', 'well', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mr.', 'Arnold', 'English', 'talk', 'shows', 'Arnold', 'performance', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'weak', 'script', 'be', 'callous', 'obnoxious', 'one', 'moment', 'incredibly', 'sensitive', 'next', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'tries', 'heroically', 'bring', 'emotional', 'truth', 'stereotypical', 'role', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'relies', 'stuttering', 'boyish', 'charm', 'breeze', 'mishmash', 'tearful', 'moments', 'are', 'less', 'convincing', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'poor', 'guy', 'do', 'when', 'working', 'cardboard', 'cutout']",Nine Months VHS

My date and I went to see The Wiz back in '78, we were the only two white folks in the packed theater. At many points in the movie the audience was laughing very hard while we sat silently. Twice my date and I found something really funny and busted up while the silent audience looked at us like we were nuts.I always remember that date when I watch a Hugh Grant movie. Hugh's only Comedy Trick is to get his character in a painfully clumsy social situation and then stammer. It becomes really painful watching his movies in a theater, because not only is it embarassing to watch a grown man get into these situations, but the embarassment lingers since there is a two second pause in the movie... the pause where the filmmaker THINKS the audience will be LOL'ing.Not only was Nine Months tiresome, but the ridiculous Robin Williams character and keystone cops chase scenes DON'T WORK in a comedy-drama.Finally, the Big Theme of this movie is that a grown man chickens out and deserts his wife and unborn child and finally comes around to assume his responsibilities...
