We see the life of the poor in a tenement (a multi-family building). His sister is to marry a rich man because she can&#8217;t afford not to. Roderick is upset by the rich man&#8217;s arrogance in ordering his sister and mother around. So he gains entry to a pawnbroker&#8217;s apartment to kill and rob her! Men soon find her body and call for the police. His conscience bothers him when a policeman summons him to the police station. He is behind in his rent. We see the others there. The Police Inspector welcomes him because of Roderick&#8217;s magazine article on crime. This Inspector can recognize the criminal type by his looks. The discuss criminal activities. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t look guilty.&#8221; They will send him to the gallows to keep their records clear (he had two stolen gold earrings).Raskolnikoff goes to an editor to get his money for his magazine article. Then to see his mother and sister at Mr. Lucien&#8217;s place. His money leads to spending and arrogance! [Is this typical of poor people who gain sudden riches?] A young woman saw Raskolnikoff near by the crime scene. Roderick returns to talk to the Inspector, who later visits his home. Later he meets Sonya and they talk about faith and beliefs. Then a man visits Roderick to apologize to his sister for what the did before. Next it is the Police Inspector visits him. No poker in his room? [Note the heating stove.] Do Raskolnikoff&#8217;s nerves bother him? Will a guilty man confess to quiet his conscience? Roderick says goodbye to Sonya and tells what he did. Did anyone else hear him? The Police Inspector found a poker that must have been the murder weapon. He asks Raskolnikoff to confess so an innocent man will be saved. Raskolnikoff returns to talk to the Police Inspector.I never read the book but it must be more complex than this condensed and simplified movie. The story seems to be a comment on the teachings of some writers who claim a superior man can violate morality with impunity. Was Nietzsche a fit person to teach others?

Little of Dostoevsky's motivation in having Raskolnikov commit the crime is explored, and the movie is more a detective story than a psychological drama. Lorre's performance, however, is excellent, as he shifts moods between psychopath, happy-go-lucky student, and desperate intellectual. Josef von Sternberg directed. The movie unfortunately was released almost simultaneously with a French version directed by Pierre Chenal, which dealt more with Raskolnikov's motivations and moral struggles, and was highly praised by critics.

333665,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6302783941,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 2]","It's difficult to translate a novel into a film, and even more difficult to translate 19th Century Russian philosophy and make it meaningful to 20th century audiences. Hence, few if any of the 30 attempts to bring Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" to the big screen have been successful. In this 1935 drama, the novel is clearly trimmed down and altered in significant places, but somehow the film retains the atmosphere of the novel.Peter Lorre is there to provide the ""foreign"" actor and Josef von Sternberg gives us the European (Germanic) directing influences.Peter Lorre (1904-64) Lorre gained prominence as the child molester in Fritz Lang's ""M"" (1931) and went on to fame as ""Mr. Moto"" in a series of 8 detective films between 1937 and 1939, although he's perhaps best known as Sydney Greenstreet's partner is films like ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) and ""Casablanca"" (1942). This is his second American film debut following a terrific performance in ""Mad Love"" (1935). He gets second billing, after Edward Arnold.Edward Arnold (1890 - 1956) plays the Police inspector. He appeared in more than 100 films from 1916 to 1956 and is best known for playing Daniel Webster in ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"" (1941) and Diamond Jim Brady in ""Diamond Jim"". He's one of the few hefty men who were ever able to achieve leading man status, but staying ""hefty"" (and not going to fat) was such a problem for him that he ultimately decided to let his girth expand while his stardom faded. This earned him many meaty character roles.Baby faced Marian Marsh (1913-2006) plays Lorre's love interest. She was a sensation in ""Svengali"" (1931) but her career at Warners faulted, so she moved to Columbia where this film was made. This may be her finest performance.Exotic looking Tala Birell (1907-1958) plays Lorre's sister. She was another in a long line of Garbo lookalikes who had a brief career in the 30s. Birell is excellent in this film.Douglass Dumbrille (1889-1974) plays Birell's suitor. Dumbrille was in more than 200 films, and worked with the Marx Brothers (""Day at the Races"") as well as Abbott and Costello (""foreign Legion"") , the Bowery Boys (""Spook Busters""), the Ritz Brothers (""The 3 Musketeers""), and Bob Hope  (""Son of Paleface""), but he also did dramatic roles in films such as ""Cardinal Richelieu"" (1935), ""Virginia City"" (1940), ""Mr. Deeds Go to Town"", and ""Julius Caesar"" (1953).Versatile Gene Lockhart (1891-1957) plays another of Birell's suitors. Lockhart appeared in more than 100 films and was nominated as Best Supporting Actor in 1939 for ""Algiers"". The father of actresses Kathleen and June Lockhart, he's best remembered for his roles as the judge in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947) and Georges de la Tremouille in ""Joan of Arc"" (1948), but I remember him best as Bob Cratchit in ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938).The show stealer is Mrs. Patrick Campbell (1865-1940 who plays the pawnbroker. It was said that the role of Eliza Doolittle in ""Pygmalion"" (1941) was written specifically for her by George Bernard Shaw. This was her final fim.Josef von Sternberg (1894-1969) directs. Born in Vienna, he grew up in New York and moved to Germany in 1929. Von Sternberg was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Morocco"" in 1930 and ""Shanghai Express"" in 1931). His credo was ""To know what to reveal and what to conceal and in what degree to do this is all there is to art."" He claimed ""I care nothing about the story, only how it is photographed."" You can see this philosophy in the film - many of the scenes have photographic beauty but don't necessarily advance the plot or serve the story which itself has been altered a lot. This was one of von Sternberg's first films without Marlene Diedrich.Over his 50 year career Lucien Ballard (1908-88) was voted Best Cinematographer at the Venice Film festival (""The Devil is a Woman"") in 1935, was Oscar nominated (""The Caretakers"") in 1963 and won an NSFC award for his work on ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). He worked with Sam Peckinpah on the TV series ""The Westerner"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), ""Cable Hogue"" (1970), ""Junior Bonner"" (1972), and ""The Getaway"" (1972). He was a favorite cinematographer of director Budd Boetticher and worked on 7 Randolph Scott films. While he is best known for his westerns, he had an impressive list of film noir (""The Killing"", ""The Lodger"", ""Laura"").1935 was a good year for films. ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and ""The Informer"" were box office and Oscar winners. Other top 10 grossing films included Gable and Harlow in ""China Seas"", Flynn and de Havilland in ""Captain Blood"", Shirley Temple in ""The Littlest Rebel"" and ""Curly Top"", and Greta Garbo in ""Anna Karenina"". Other notable films released that year included ""Alice Adams"" with Hepburn, ""The 39 Steps"", ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", ""David Copperfield"", ""A Tale of Two Cities"", ""Les Miserables"", ""Top Hat"", and ""A Night at the Opera"". In Germany, Leni Riefenstahl released ""Triumph of the Will"".Don't view the film and expect to see the novel. Nor should you expect to see the kind of film von Sternberg is most famous for, with the endless close ups and ornate settings. Think of this film as an early film noir and you will be most comfortable.",3,Deviates from the book but tries to capture the spirit,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,5185,"['difficult', 'translate',

I believe Von Sterberg thought so himself, and directed only out of business obligations.  But partly because the director has already owned up, and partly because I believe in treating adaptations as individuals works rather than requiring them to be faithful to the source material (some of the best films ever made were highly unfaithful to their sources or to historical fact), I will not dwell on this.  Suffice it to say that a movie that was faithful to both the story as well as the feel and the philosophy of Crime and Punishment would undoubtedly go down in history as a masterpiece.  I said the exact same thing about Lord of the Rings years and years ago and it turned out I was right there.  I hear the 1970 Russian version is good, maybe it needs a raised profile?Anyway, Porfiry is maybe the best character in all of fiction, even though he only appears in like five actual scenes in the novel.  And while Edward Arnold's version of Porfiry is significantly different from the Porfiry in my head (for one thing, he's not as young-looking as described in the book) he's still very good and adds a few onscreen nuances to the character not present in the book.  His scenes were entertaining and possibly the only reason I continued to watch (it's not a long film, like ninety minutes or so).  He raises the film from an otherwise well-made-but-still-forgettable-murder-story.As for Peter Lorre, I got the impression he wasn't doing his best work here, and probably knew it.  Apparently the film was his idea, but he probably saw how unfaithful the film was to the book, and how even key scenes such as the reading of the Lazarus story or the character of Sonya were watered-down (I could go on) and decided to withhold his skills.  I could be wrong, maybe it's because he wasn't used to English at that point, but he wasn't as good here as he was in M, Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, or The Man Who Knew Too Much.As for Von Sternberg, this is actually the first film of his that I've seen.  I don't know if I'll see more.  His style is kind of Howard Hawks with a dab of German Expressionism.I can really only recommend this to hardcore Lorre or Von Sternberg fans, or Dostoevsky fans wanting to see an entertaining interpretation of Porfiry.",3,An otherwise forgettable adaptation with one saving grace,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,2544,"['movie', ""n't"", 'badly', 'made', 'anything', 'just', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'own', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'two', 'stars', 'reviewer', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'entertained', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'Porfiry.Let', 'get', 'way', 'right', 'now', 'adaptation', 'best', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'believe', 'Von', 'Sterberg', 'thought', 'so', 'directed', 'only', 'business', 'obligations', 'partly', 'director', 'already', 'owned', 'up', 'partly', 'believe', 'treating', 'adaptations', 'individuals', 'rather', 'requiring', 'be', 'faithful', 'source', 'material', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'were', 'highly', 'unfaithful', 'sources', 'historical', 'fact', 'will', 'not', 'dwell', 'Suffice', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'faithful', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'feel', 'philosophy', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'masterpiece', 'said', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'years', 'years', 'ago', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'right', 'there', 'hear', '1970', 'Russian', 'version', 'good', 'maybe', 'raised', 'profile', 'Anyway', 'Porfiry', 'maybe', 'best', 'character', 'fiction', 'even', 'only', 'five', 'actual', 'scenes', 'novel', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'version', 'Porfiry', 'significantly', 'different', 'Porfiry', 'head', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'as', 'young-looking', 'described', 'book', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'few', 'onscreen', 'nuances', 'character', 'not', 'present', 'book', 'scenes', 'were', 'entertaining', 'possibly', 'only', 'reason', 'continued', 'watch', 'not', 'long', 'film', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'otherwise', 'well-made-but-still-forgettable-murder-story.As', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'got', 'impression', 'was', ""n't"", 'doing', 'best', 'work', 'here', 'probably', 'knew', 'Apparently', 'film', 'was', 'idea', 'probably', 'saw', 'how', 'unfaithful', 'film', 'was', 'book', 'how', 'even', 'key', 'scenes', 'such', 'reading', 'Lazarus', 'story', 'character', 'Sonya', 'were', 'watered-down', 'could', 'go', 'decided', 'withhold', 'skills', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'English', 'point', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'here', 'was', 'M', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'Casablanca', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much.As', 'Von', 'Sternberg', 'actually', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'style', 'kind', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'dab', 'German', 'Expressionism.I', 'can', 'really', 'only', 'recommend', 'hardcore', 'Lorre', 'Von', 'Sternberg', 'fans', 'Dostoevsky', 'fans', 'wanting', 'see', 'entertaining', 'interpretation', 'Porfiry']",N/A

333668,A3L3OKIPMLGAUK,6302783941,Ricardo C.,"[0, 2]","Peter Lorre stars in this adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel as Roderick Raskolnikov. Roderick hits hard times after he graduates from college and in fusteration, kills a mean spirited pawnbroker. I never read the novel but I can see why it's director, Josef von Sternberg, disliked the film. First off, there is not a single Russian accent in the film. I almost thought the film's locale was shifted to America but the currency was rubles and possible imprisonment in Siberia was mentioned several times. Secoundly, the rest of the cast is totally forgetable ranging from far too melodramatic, boring, and just far too hammy. I'll give credit to the actress who played the wretched pawnbroker though. Roderick just didn't need everyone hounding him. The girl he met or his sister would have been more than enough so we could have seen more of Roderick's breakdown in private. Lorre prevailed over lousy material to work with and this turns out to be one of his best roles. I also must compliment Stromberg's eye for direction and use of lighting. I do reccomend the film but just barely.",3,Lorre barely saves this one,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,1093,"['Peter', 'Lorre', 'adaptation', 'Fyodor', 'Dostoevsky', 'novel', 'Roderick', 'Raskolnikov', 'Roderick', 'hard', 'times', 'college', 'fusteration', 'mean', 'spirited', 'pawnbroker', 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'director', 'Josef', 'von', 'Sternberg', 'disliked', 'film', 'First', 'off', 'not', 'single', 'Russian', 'accent', 'film', 'almost', 'thought', 'film', 'locale', 'was', 'shifted', 'America', 'currency', 'was', 'rubles', 'possible', 'imprisonment', 'Siberia', 'was', 'mentioned', 'several', 'times', 'Secoundly', 'rest', 'cast', 'totally', 'forgetable', 'ranging', 'far', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'boring', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'hammy', ""'ll"", 'give', 'credit', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'wretched', 'pawnbroker', 'Roderick', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'everyone', 'hounding', 'girl', 'met', 'sister', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'enough', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Roderick', 'breakdown', 'private', 'Lorre', 'prevailed', 'over', 'lousy', 'material', 'work', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'also', 'must', 'compliment', 'Stromberg', 'eye', 'direction', 'use', 'lighting', 'do', 'reccomend', 'film', 'just', 'barely']",N/A
