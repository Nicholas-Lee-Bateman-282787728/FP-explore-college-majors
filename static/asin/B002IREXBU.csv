Dallas Gilbert and Wayne Burton would be fun to chat with and to go on one of there hunts with if I could keep a straight face and not giggle at the whole idea.Not a big foot movie, just a look at two men who choose to spend there lives chasing Bigfoot and is this any worse then setting around watching football or typing up movie reviews ?",3,Sad story of two buddies Dallas Gilbert and Wayne Burton,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,757,"['Sad', 'story', 'two', 'buddies', 'Dallas', 'Gilbert', 'Wayne', 'Burton', 'who', 'really', 'believe', 'big', 'foot', 'do', 'prove', 'world', 'big', 'foot', 'real', 'kid', 'kept', 'hoping', 'would', 'find', 'solid', 'proof', 'sort', 'prove', 'right', 'so', 'many', 'unsolved', 'monster', 'tails', 'not', 'one', 'shred', 'solid', 'proof', 'old', 'boys', 'just', 'get', 'ridicule', 'disrespect', 'would', 'expect', 'real', 'world', 'Dallas', 'Gilbert', 'Wayne', 'Burton', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'chat', 'go', 'one', 'hunts', 'could', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'not', 'giggle', 'whole', 'idea.Not', 'big', 'foot', 'movie', 'just', 'look', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'choose', 'spend', 'chasing', 'Bigfoot', 'worse', 'then', 'setting', 'around', 'watching', 'football', 'typing', 'up', 'movie', 'reviews']",N/A

It is not particularly deep on the plight of the downtrodden and disenfranchised (both examples being white, middle aged males, no less), and it certainly has little to do with Sasquatch research. But it has something. In fact, it has two things that many films that are leagues above it in all qualitative ways do not have: that is empathy and hilarity. Think of films that have one of those qualities. They almost always lack the other- be they documentaries or fictions. Most comedies nowadays tend to be hip, snide, superior, whilst most films that show compassion seem to be relentlessly dry, PC, and `serious' (emphasis on the quotation marks about serious). Think of any film in the last 20 years that is great in one of these categories and, again, it will almost always lack the other, in spades. But this film does not. Just when you want to cry and feel sick over how idiotic and gullible these men are, Wayne will start sucking on a rotten apple, comment on it, then suck it some more. Or Dallas will start pointing to a dark spot in a photo and insist that he sees a head or arm or something Bigfootian. So, the fact the film has loads of these two qualities makes it not great, but exceedingly likable. And, upon further review, also quite a good documentary. One may not be so moved to get to know the two idiots any better, but the chances are you will not regret having watched this film.

1270496,A2BKFOS8V9ZRAW,B002IREXBU,H.M. 2005,"[4, 5]","This short film (only 62 minutes long) is the story of not so much Bigfoot, but of two researchers, Dallas Gilbert and Wayne Burton of Portsmouth, Ohio, and their efforts to prove to the world that Bigfoot does exist through the means of photography. Dallas shows his collection of over 150 photographs that he has taken himself which hang on his wall in his den. We meet his wife Chris and their dogs, as well as Ron Lewis, a researcher from northern Ohio, who accompanies Dallas to Tennessee for a conference held by Mary Green. We next see Wayne in the Buckeye State continuing to research in Dallas' stead (Dallas receives two awards from Green's group, one for his achievements in research and the other for his late friend retired Sheriff Fred Bradshaw). The two lament their lack of successful prodding of the scientific community to view their evidence and also the fact that their homes are basically falling apart and need maintenance. Then they receive a visit from a certain California group and researcher (hint: HONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK OKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK) who stays about five days in the area and researches with the pair the first night but then decides to go it on their own after that. All in all, this is a really good documentary about two guys who are pursuing their passion despite the ridicule they have received from others.

1270497,A1BXFS1R6NBXDD,B002IREXBU,Horror Nerd,"[0, 0]","Please take a chance on this wonderful film. Its a picture that starts with the elements of bigfoot and documentary film making but ends up being about friendship, personal meaning, obsession, quiet desperation and the ripple effects of a bad childhood. Its honestly moving and more powerful then all kinds of sappy films that get tagged as such. This isn't to say that it doesn't involve the hunt for bigfoot. Almost all of it does, but through that quest it explores the two people doing the searching and really becomes about them. I think if you want a movie about the hunt for bigfoot this will give you a lot of that - it just gives you so much more. I never thought I would be so drawn in and involved in these lives but I was. Outstanding film. Shows how are love of monsters runs a lot deeper then just the obvious scary stuff. Movies are not about what they are about, they are about HOW they are about them.

I wasn't pleased that it involved Tom Biscardi (a known hoaxer).  I believe Gilbert's findings are concrete and he seem to know what he was doing when they (his calls were impressive as he tried do some 'chatter') went out to do research.  Im glad I didn't by this though because I would've gotten rid of it after the first viewing.  Gilbert's friend Wayne talks about how he was suicidal at one point in his life and he still has thoughts about things like that.  A serious researcher would never put that in a movie concerning Sasquatch.Time and time again Biscardi has been caught with known hoaxers or trying to doctor something to make it look genuine.
