1545882,A2GFYAY6RQ1TIV,B00843TZJ2,Abner Doubleday,"[0, 0]","I saw pretty much the same CS&N concert last summer and thoroughly enjoyed it. They were very engaging and they were not just phoning it in like say Van Morrison. I had very low expectations and went because they were one of the few groups left that were on my ""bucket list"" and wanted to bring my young son. A few months before that I saw Stephen Stills play in a small 500 seat venue and was lucky enough to be in the front row. Stephen is pretty much deaf and that's why his voice is so bad despite using hearing aids. He jokes about it during the show. When people call out requests he says, ""yell all you want. I can't hear you anyway."" Nonetheless, he is still one of the greatest guitarists alive and its worth it just to see him ply his craft. He barely gets a chance to show his chops on this DVD/CD, but he can definitely still bring it. Anyone who goes to see groups of this vintage and expects them to sound like they did 40 years ago is being unrealistic. It's not like you can't sample the songs on Amazon or I-Tunes before you buy it so the quality of their voices shouldn't be a surprise. Go back and listen to 4-Way Street.

So for all fans this is a very welcome occasion to hear an official, brilliantly recorded concert.And thankfuly they deliver a profound evening, mixing the old classics with newer songs, including Graham Nash's controversial and poignant tribute to Bradley Manning ""Almost Gone"". And diving deep into their impressive back catalogue, specially Stephen Stills who come up with the rarely performed ""As I Come Of Age"" and ""So Begins The Task"" (both played at the CSNY 1970 tour). Especially the first is truly magic, providing one of the moments of transcendent (vocal) beauty that is unique for this trio.As for the backingband it's almost the same as on theCrosby-Nash: In Concertwith the addition of Todd Caldwell on the Hammond B-3. a band who knows how to respectfully lay back but also can rock with the best of them all anchored by the drumming of Steve DiStanislao (known for his work on David Gilmour's ""Island""-album and following tour).Much malign has been said about Stills's vocal, but actually his singing is better here than it has been in many years really enabling him to hit the higher notes. And his legendary guitarplaying as firery and riveting as ever. Graham Nash - probably one of the all time most underrated songwriters - and David Crosby still delivers their trademark harmony vocals.This band has for whatever reasons always attracted a certain animosity and some decisevely unfair criticism. But they also have a dedicated fan base and this DVD clearly shows the strong bond - and deep rapport - between band and audience.Sure the day when they were the vanguard is long gone, but what they deliver 2012 is very far from nostalgia and cash-in. So their broad and dedicated fan base should delight in this. And for new fans/listeners this might be the perfect introduction to one of the most adventurous and prolific bands ever.",5,pure beauty - classic rock at its best,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,2043,"['CSN', 'not', 'exactly', 'flooded', 'market', 'new', 'releases', 'latest', 'release', '3', 'together', 'being', 'CSNY', 'release', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'Live', 'was', 'extremely', 'Neilocentric', 'say', 'least', 'So', 'fans', 'very', 'welcome', 'occasion', 'hear', 'official', 'brilliantly', 'recorded', 'concert.And', 'thankfuly', 'deliver', 'profound', 'evening', 'mixing', 'old', 'classics', 'newer', 'songs', 'including', 'Graham', 'Nash', 'controversial', 'poignant', 'tribute', 'Bradley', 'Manning', 'Almost', 'Gone', 'diving', 'deep', 'impressive', 'back', 'catalogue', 'specially', 'Stephen', 'Stills', 'who', 'come', 'up', 'rarely', 'performed', 'Come', 'Age', 'So', 'Task', 'played', 'CSNY', '1970', 'tour', 'Especially', 'first', 'truly', 'magic', 'providing', 'one', 'moments', 'transcendent', 'vocal', 'beauty', 'unique', 'trio.As', 'backingband', 'almost', 'same', 'theCrosby-Nash', 'Concertwith', 'addition', 'Todd', 'Caldwell', 'Hammond', 'B-3', 'band', 'who', 'how', 'respectfully', 'lay', 'back', 'also', 'can', 'rock', 'best', 'anchored', 'drumming', 'Steve', 'DiStanislao', 'known', 'work', 'David', 'Gilmour', 'Island', '-album', 'following', 'tour', '.Much', 'malign', 'been', 'said', 'Stills', 'vocal', 'actually', 'singing', 'better', 'here', 'been', 'many', 'years', 'really', 'enabling', 'hit', 'higher', 'notes', 'legendary', 'guitarplaying', 'firery', 'riveting', 'ever', 'Graham', 'Nash', 'probably', 'one', 'time', 'most', 'underrated', 'songwriters', 'David', 'Crosby', 'still', 'trademark', 'harmony', 'vocals.This', 'band', 'reasons', 'always', 'attracted', 'certain', 'animosity', 'decisevely', 'unfair', 'criticism', 'also', 'have', 'dedicated', 'fan', 'base', 'DVD', 'clearly', 'strong', 'bond', 'deep', 'rapport', 'band', 'audience.Sure', 'day', 'when', 'were', 'vanguard', 'long', 'gone', 'what', 'deliver', '2012', 'very', 'far', 'nostalgia', 'cash-in', 'broad', 'dedicated', 'fan', 'base', 'should', 'delight', 'new', 'fans/listeners', 'might', 'be', 'perfect', 'introduction', 'one', 'most', 'adventurous', 'prolific', 'bands', 'ever']",CSN 2012

No problem with that!I love the whole package except for a couple things:-My musical hero Stills starts out a little bit vocally flat and I'm surprised this wasn't ""fixed"".  It only took a few songs for him to hit his stride vocally, so obviously it's not like a couple little, flattering ""tweaking"" here and there at the first portion of the show would have been that big a deal artistically, and I like to believe the majority of musical purists wouldn't have been too terribly bugged.-More importantly, overall I found the sound a bit heavy on the mid to low mid range and I have to EQ the crap out of it to get any ""Oomph"" in the very low and very high end.  Especially considering the stellar quality of musical talent of all on stage, this is a shame.  Whoever did the sound for Stills Live At Shepherd's Bush did a much better job at the EQ mix and the person who produced the sound on this package would do well to study that previous work.All that whining aside, these late 60-year-olds sound pretty damn good!

Both David and Graham exhibit weaknesses individually, but more to the point it's their blend that just doesn't make it for a good portion of the show.  This is even sadder given that they had three more singers behind them providing additional vocal power.  I personally thought that they were best on the quieter stuff, and not very good at all vocally on the uptempo pieces.  I think I would also have assign big-time blame to whomever mixed their voices for this release.  Not a very good job.  I think some of the vocal shortcomings could have been modified or even almost eliminated with a better mix.One must remember that we're talking about three seventy-year old voices that have been doing this for fifty-ish years.  I frankly was kind of surprised they still put this out after listening to the final product.  Shortly after this I put on ""The Acoustic Concert"" DVD, recorded 21 years earlier in San Francisco.

1545895,A2GTS9FVQDFWAJ,B00843TZJ2,LilRedVette,"[8, 8]","I probably will be repeating what many other reviewers have said but I'll add my thoughts.  First of all, Crosby, Stills and Nash (and Young) are....or should I say were...an iconic musical group of the folk rock age.  I grew up listening to them having several of their albums, listening to their beautiful melodies and forthright lyrics which are considered classic by anyone's musical standards.The voices of these once angelic-like harmonious geniouses are gone.  I almost feel embarrassed for them as I listen to them try to recreate the harmonies which were so adored in the past.  In all due respect to Stephen Stills, his voice sounds the worst which unfortunately brings down Graham Nash and David Crosby.  When he sings solo, he sounds a little better, but not much.  But the bad doesn't end with Stills.  Nash sounds a little better but his harmonizing sounds off at times also.  Crosby sounds the best and he seems to carry the others which otherwise would have been like listening to karaoki on a cruise ship.  Believe me, this pains me to be this negative and I kind of feel guilty with this review knowing how much I loved them and still do.Having said all that, the music of CSN speaks for itself and the band does a great job with every song.  No complaints regarding the musicians and production!  But the good stops there.  As a reviewer said, this live recording should not be your first CSN listening experience.  What a shame!  It's almost like watching an athlete who instead of retiring, continued on way too long which diminshed their greatness.  Only a long time fan of CSN (+ Y) will know how truly awesome this group is and will forever be.  I just hope they won't be judged by this live performance.Note:  This is a review of the 2 cds only, not the dvd which I have yet to see.

Gig took place and recorded live on April 22, 2012 at the Performing Arts Center in San Luis Obispo, California. Although I haven't seen Crosby, Stills & Nash perform live yet - I've always appreciated their work since I was like maybe in the sixth grade. With this 2-CD / DVD release of their 2012 tour - I was thoroughly convinced that these veterans (for the most part) still have it. Tunes that managed to bring back to mind some precious memories include ""Carry On / Questions"", ""Long Time Gone"" (used to love hearing this on our classic rock radio station), ""Southern Cross"", ""Deja Vu"", the beautiful ""Wooden Ships"", ""Teach Your Children"" and ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes"". Then there are the two Buffalo Springfield songs ""Bluebird"" and the must-hear ""For What's It's Worth"". Plus, I didn't mind taking in their new material like ""Almost Gone"", the somewhat inspiring ""Radio"" and ""As I Come Of Age"".

However, there's nothing here that sounds nearly as good, or as fresh, as these guys in their prime. The new songs are nice, but mostly forgetable. Crosby's and Nash's voices still sound good, but have definitely aged, while Stills' voice is personable, but muted. The backing band is every bit as professional as might be expected. Stills' finds some room for very expressive guitar work, but certainly not as often as for his solo performances. I prefer this to the choppy, but likeable, Deja Vu Live, but certainly not to any of their live performances from the 70s & 80s, or to Stills' Live at Shepherd's Bush.

1545910,ACM90BRKX73OG,B00843TZJ2,Tom,"[1, 2]","I was a huge fan of Crosby, Stills, and Nash (and sometimes Young) beginning with their 1969 debut album. I attended several concerts and bought everything the guys recorded together and apart up to ""CSN"" (1977). Then, for several reasons, CSN's music began to grate on me and I generally stayed away, although I've retained a strong interest in the music of Crosby and his preceding band, the Byrds.CSN has been touring every summer for several years and I've caught a few shows. I attended their concert in Rochester N.Y. in 2009 and was disappointed that half of the tunes were from their aborted covers album. I didn't pay all that scratch to hear covers. They scheduled another appearance in Rochester as part of their 2012 summer tour and I considered attending but opted out when I heard about this DVD package. Why pay $120 for two concert tickets when I could see the same show on DVD for $20?Overall, I enjoyed this DVD. The guys play most of the big hits with some solo material, a sprinkling of new songs, and a couple of Buffalo Springfield tunes. The 5-piece back-up band (organ, drums, bass, guitar, keyboards) is tight. The venue is great (recorded at The Performing Arts Center, San Luis Obispo, CA, 4/22/12) and the editing and sound are very good. Sixty-seven-year-old Stills, ranked #47 in Rolling Stone's latest 100 Greatest Guitarists list, shows he can still play at a high level but he has lost quite a bit of vocal range. It's also evident, and I'll put this as kindly as I can with all due respect to a great musician, that he struggles with his enunciation as a result of dental work. Several years ago there were even rumors floating around that he had suffered a stroke because of his elocution difficulties but I can remember seeing signs of the problem way back in a 1991 Bob Costas interview. His hearing loss no doubt compounds the issue. However, seventy-one-year-old Crosby and a spry seventy-year-old Nash can still sing up a storm. Their spine-tingling harmonic crescendo at the end of Guinnevere is worth the price of the DVD alone. I'm not a huge fan of Nash's in-your-face social sermonizing, one of the reasons I originally lost interest in the group. Anyone remember his ""...rules and regulations, who needs them?..."" from ""Chicago""? I'll bet Nash has made damn sure his accountants took advantage of every rule and regulation over the years. Nash has made a very comfortable living out of criticizing the ""establishment"" and then retreating back to his lovely fan-financed mansion in Encino and now, in the exclusive North Shore neighborhood of Kauai, Hawaii. His new song, ""Almost Gone,"" which glorifies Bradley Manning, the troubled Army private who passed classified military documents to WikiLeaks, is downright nauseating. Crosby definitely got squeezed out of this concert with the lion's share of the songs written by Stills and Nash. He only has one song in the entire second set. The concert's final encore, Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, is an absolute joy to watch and listen to even though we all can sing the song backwards in our sleep.The DVD features a highly edited interview segment in which CSN individually gush over each other. But anyone who has kept pace with CSN knows Crosby and Nash tolerate Stills for business reasons only.Fans of CSN will appreciate this DVD very much. Let's face it, how much more time is left for these guys to be able to perform together? Too bad Crosby, Roger McGuinn, and Chris Hillman couldn't get together for one last go 'round as the Byrds. We're only three years away from that band's 50th anniversary but McGuinn won't be persuaded even then. And why couldn't someone have put together a DVD of one of the 2011 Buffalo Springfield concerts? Neil Young probably put the kibosh on that.Buyer beware: I'm surprised at Amazon's price.
