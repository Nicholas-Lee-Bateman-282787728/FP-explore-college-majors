To date this film is still her best performance. Judd plays Ruby Gissing, a young woman who we see at the start of the film driving away from her roots in the mountains of Tennessee and heading for Panama Beach, Florida. All she has with her is her determination, her journal, her Granny's rocking chair and her dreams for a better future. This is a simple but moving story of one young woman's odyssey to find a home and a place where she will belong. Quickly she finds a bungalow house to live in and saleswoman's position at the local beach shop but will that be enough to keep her hopes and dreams alive? We spend the film rooting for her to succeed as she meets frequent obstacles and essential life lessons on her quest to find her own little piece of ""paradise"".",5,Ashley Judd's earliest and finest performance.,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,897,"['1993', 'Grand', 'Prize', 'Winner', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'new', 'young', 'actress', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'date', 'film', 'still', 'best', 'performance', 'Judd', 'Ruby', 'Gissing', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'see', 'start', 'film', 'driving', 'away', 'roots', 'mountains', 'Tennessee', 'heading', 'Panama', 'Beach', 'Florida', 'determination', 'journal', 'Granny', 'rocking', 'chair', 'dreams', 'better', 'future', 'simple', 'moving', 'story', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'odyssey', 'find', 'home', 'place', 'where', 'will', 'belong', 'Quickly', 'bungalow', 'house', 'live', 'saleswoman', 'position', 'local', 'beach', 'shop', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'keep', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'alive', 'spend', 'film', 'rooting', 'succeed', 'frequent', 'obstacles', 'essential', 'life', 'lessons', 'quest', 'find', 'own', 'little', 'piece', 'paradise']",N/A

But I don't know if any film she has made or will ever make again can compare to the lonely magic of this film.  I can't explain it.  It's like a tour of the human soul from the perspective of a young woman who has left the past behind to start a new life only to find out that ""new"" is fraught with its own challenges and misery. Same problems, different geography.  There's so much pain in the everydayness of our lives, in trying to find meaning and purpose - in how the mundane can bring us contentment in one breath and suffering in the next.  But ultimately, that's OK.  There are all of these quiet spaces of contemplation and observation in this film - similar to those moments each of us experience in daily life.  It draws you in and you can't quite figure out why.

The narrative overlay comes from Ruby's journal and is what really makes this movie, as she searches for meaning in her life and others'.  There is no music track; it is all slow and serene and silent, except for one scene.  There are wonderful shots of the ocean and beach, and an especially memorable scene of Ruby opening her brand new journal notebook and slightly lingering over it.  There is something about a clean sheet of paper or new notebook, like a brand new baby with so-smooth skin, untouched, unspoiled, unwritten on.  Ashley Judd, of Judd family fame, is very good here, although her natural expression is awfully close to a smirk.  And I loved the touch of the Indian woman singing at the beginning and close to the end.

She certainly deserved a best actress nomination for this role; I believe the only valid reason she didn't receive one was that  this was too small a film and slipped by fairly unnoticed by most people  and critics alike.  While Ashley Judd has seen gone on to become quite a  Hollywood celebrity, I do not feel that she has topped her performance in  this film.  The film itself is fairly straight-forward; it concerns a young  girl named Ruby who runs away from an abusive family environment in  Tennessee to try to make a new life for herself in a small Floridan ocean  resort town.  The film details her struggles to establish an identity for  herself and to find her niche in life.  This film, understandably, is quite  character-driven in much the same way as in &quot;Ulee's Gold&quot; (by the  same director) or Robert Duvall's &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; or Joan Chen's  &quot;Xiu Xiu&quot; (all of which are excellent films).  Nothing much  happens during the film, yet the film is absorbing in its portrayal of the  daily existence of Ruby.  We see the slow metamorphosis of Ashley Judd's  character from an uncertain girl into one who is more comfortable and has  found direction for her life.  It is all very subtly done with little  nuances in Ashley Judd's performance and delicate, deliberate pacing by the  director; nothing is flashed in big bold letters in front of our eyes, and  I believe this makes the film all the stronger.  The film is not for  everyone - those searching for mindless, fast-paced blockbuster action need  not apply, but those looking for a strong character-driven story will find  much to like in this small gem of a film.",5,Ashley Judd's debut film,963360000,"07 12, 2000",2000,1758,"['Ruby', 'Paradise', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'first', 'film', 'opinion', 'best', 'performance', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'best', 'actress', 'nomination', 'role', 'believe', 'only', 'valid', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'one', 'was', 'was', 'too', 'small', 'film', 'slipped', 'fairly', 'unnoticed', 'most', 'people', 'critics', 'alike', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'seen', 'gone', 'become', 'quite', 'Hollywood', 'celebrity', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'topped', 'performance', 'film', 'film', 'fairly', 'straight-forward', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Ruby', 'who', 'away', 'abusive', 'family', 'environment', 'Tennessee', 'try', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'herself', 'small', 'Floridan', 'ocean', 'resort', 'town', 'film', 'details', 'struggles', 'establish', 'identity', 'herself', 'find', 'niche', 'life', 'film', 'understandably', 'quite', 'character-driven', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'quot', 'Ulee', 'Gold', 'quot', 'same', 'director', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'quot', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'quot', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'quot', 'Xiu', 'Xiu', 'quot', 'are', 'excellent', 'films', 'Nothing', 'much', 'happens', 'film', 'film', 'absorbing', 'portrayal', 'daily', 'existence', 'Ruby', 'see', 'slow', 'metamorphosis', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'character', 'uncertain', 'girl', 'one', 'who', 'more', 'comfortable', 'found', 'direction', 'life', 'very', 'subtly', 'done', 'little', 'nuances', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'performance', 'delicate', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'director', 'nothing', 'flashed', 'big', 'bold', 'letters', 'front', 'eyes', 'believe', 'film', 'stronger', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'searching', 'mindless', 'fast-paced', 'blockbuster', 'action', 'need', 'not', 'apply', 'looking', 'strong', 'character-driven', 'story', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'like', 'small', 'gem', 'film']",N/A

In that sense, the picture underlines the desirefor youth to often try to break free, and aspire tosomething greater than what they have right now, and tosearch and carve out a higher personal meaning andmessage, from Life.The story, written from a male author, apparently,imagining what goes on in a  young woman's mind in such asituation, is acceptably written, if not, a bit slow,stereotypical and one-dimensional. However, thosedownsides are made up for by the realistic qualities shownin the movie, by the actors, such as Judd, BentleyMitchum, Dorothy Lyman, for example, many who play their roleswith enormous credibility and sincerity.This movie also recalls similar pieces, made from the1980's, such as Nastassja Kinski's PARIS TEXAS, showing aman searching for the mother of his child, and longing fora personal meaning in his life.Obviously, the story's one-dimensional quality limitsperhaps what could normally be demonstrated by the actors,however, the intention of the writer, and of the story, isproably th extent to which many people are intropsective,and live happy lives even with the moderate financial andhuman support they can rely on, that others might see asinsufficient, lacking or unsatisfactory.",4,The desire for youth to often try to break free,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,1624,"['RUBY', 'IN', 'PARADISE', 'very', 'difficult', 'movie', 'find', 'not', 'yeton', 'DVD', 'small', 'story', 'comparable', 'toJudd', 'other', 'movie', 'Where', 'Heart', 'Is', 'sense', 'thatwe', 'see', 'young', 'person', 'case', 'woman', 'running', 'difficult', 'limited', 'life', 'rural', 'America', 'perhaps', 'Tennessee', 'dreaming', 'get', 'future', 'thateveryone', 'have', 'live', 'preordainedfashion', 'sense', 'picture', 'desirefor', 'youth', 'often', 'try', 'break', 'free', 'aspire', 'tosomething', 'greater', 'what', 'have', 'right', 'now', 'tosearch', 'carve', 'out', 'higher', 'personal', 'meaning', 'andmessage', 'Life.The', 'story', 'written', 'male', 'author', 'apparently', 'imagining', 'what', 'young', 'woman', 'mind', 'such', 'asituation', 'acceptably', 'written', 'not', 'bit', 'slow', 'stereotypical', 'one-dimensional', 'However', 'thosedownsides', 'are', 'made', 'up', 'realistic', 'qualities', 'shownin', 'movie', 'actors', 'such', 'Judd', 'BentleyMitchum', 'Dorothy', 'Lyman', 'example', 'many', 'who', 'play', 'roleswith', 'enormous', 'credibility', 'sincerity.This', 'movie', 'also', 'similar', 'pieces', 'made', 'the1980', 'such', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'PARIS', 'TEXAS', 'showing', 'aman', 'searching', 'mother', 'child', 'longing', 'fora', 'personal', 'meaning', 'life.Obviously', 'story', 'one-dimensional', 'quality', 'limitsperhaps', 'what', 'could', 'normally', 'be', 'demonstrated', 'actors', 'however', 'intention', 'writer', 'story', 'isproably', 'th', 'extent', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'intropsective', 'live', 'happy', 'lives', 'even', 'moderate', 'financial', 'andhuman', 'support', 'can', 'rely', 'others', 'might', 'see', 'asinsufficient', 'lacking', 'unsatisfactory']",N/A
