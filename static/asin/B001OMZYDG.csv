The characters are even more fleshed out and involved in this season, introducing new ones to love, hate, root for. The action and plot really heat up for the second half of this show, but the comedy is thankfully not left in the dust. The animation and musical scores are perfect, There is just so much to praise about this series that I just can't put it all here. Now for the flaws, The ending, the last 4-5 episodes move much to fast, and story suffers or it. Major plot twists occur, instead of being wrapped up, and so much new information is thrown at the viewer that we may have to slow down and just take it all in. The conclusion is good and satisfying though, even if it leaves some large plot holes and unanswered questions (thankfully answered in the wrap up movie Conqueror of Shamballa). Also there is FMA:B which kind of obscures this series in its' shadow.

1222853,A18JORXY0YARAX,B001OMZYDG,Anne with an e,"[3, 8]","Oh, what happened to you, FMA?  The first season is so good, so epic!  And then the second season becomes so bogged down, so slow, and ends with the stupidest plot twist which nearly ruins the whole show!  Sure, it seems to start out strong, and introduces one of the most kickenest of all teachers ever, Izumi, and really starts picking up the pace with Greed and his chimera crew.  And then slows it down again with Wrath and filler.  The pacing slingshots like that, alternating between exciting and boring but not doing much to advance the plot for about ten episodes before finally starting the build to the finale.  And what a disappointing finale it was.  The twist in regards to the truth behind the Gate just calls into question all you thought you knew about the world of FMA, and not in a good way.  I won't give it away, and maybe I'm just jaded from reading too much SF over the years, but I pretty much hate episodes 49-51 because of that twist.On the plus side, Scar, Lust and the other humunculi get some great character development.  On the negative side, the ultimate villain (since every show needs one I guess) and resolution to the show are great disappointments.  I'm not averse to bittersweet endings, but I am averse to silly plot twists thrown in with no foreshadowing or thought to how they'd really affect the mechanics of the setting.  I really wanted to love this show, I really did.  And I do love it, up until about halfway through.

1222866,ACFZ53LQVMXCE,B001OMZYDG,Kay One,"[4, 6]","Ok, I'll confess, I'm a latecomer to the FMA franchise and actually started off watching Brotherhood first, knowing full well how the two series differed. Still I didn't want to make any judgements about the original anime series without watching it to completion. So after finishing FMA:Brotherhood, I set down and watch the entire original 51 ep TV series and while I can recognize how this was quite a good series when it originally came out in 2003 and there was no complete manga story yet, having watched it now in 2011 with a complete manga storyline, I cannot help but be unimpressed and frankly dissapointed with the conclusion of the original series.As many know, the first half of the series followed whatever manga storyline was written at the time and they stretched out that material as far as they could go, about 25 eps. By the time they had to produce the final half, they had no manga storyline to base on so credit to the director and writer, they crafted an original storyline taking characters in a far different direction than would be written in the manga. It's easy to tell how this storyline was being made up as it went along because it frankly meandered, was quite directionless at time and stuffed with pointless filler as the screenwriters were trying decide where the story was going. Compared to Brotherhood, there were many gripes I had about the 2nd half of this show:1. The Philosopher's Stone - unlike Brotherhood where that no longer became the main point of the story as it moved onto something far more important and grand, this was still the central focus and somewhat plot-driving MacGuffin of the original series. Seriously? You couldn't develop the story any further than that? At the end our main villain Dante was still trying to produce a Philosopher's Stone because she couldnt make her own.2. Dante - Ok, this main villain was frankly quite weak, especially compared to the devious genius of Father from the second series. Her motivations were small in scope and rather pathetic, leading to an even more pathetic end.3. The Homunculi - the original incarnations had some interesting points to them, including the personal journey of Lust, who was actually much more one dimensional in the new series, but that was probably done because she was such a prominent character in this series. But I found all the original incarnations of Pride, Sloth, Wrath, Envy and Greed to be less well written and interesting.4. Ed & Al - was it my imagination or we're our main heroes far more annoying and immature compared to their characterization in Brotherhood? Ed was about the same but more headstrong and bullheaded in the original series, and Al, my he was incredibly annoying, childish and short sighted. The Brotherhood incarnation of Al had a maturity, quick-thinking and intelligence beyond the years of his 10 year old sounding voice and frankly a very likeable and cool character. The original series Al was simply a child and thought like one.5. The setting - You really don't see much of this world except of parts of Amnestris and some slivers of Ishbal, but both nations, as well as other nations of Drachma, Xing and the dead kingdom of Xerxes were far more fleshed out in the new series, leading to a much more vivid, rich and detailed, believable world. In the original series, you barely know anything about the history and culture of the nation where this series takes place and frankly by the end of the series, you learn little more about it than when you started.I could go on but I've made my point pretty clear that Brotherhood really uncovers a lot of the weaknesses of the 2nd half of this original series.",3,Dissapointing end to a good series,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,3667,"['Ok', ""'ll"", 'confess', ""'m"", 'latecomer', 'FMA', 'franchise', 'actually', 'started', 'off', 'watching', 'Brotherhood', 'first', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'how', 'two', 'series', 'differed', 'Still', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'judgements', 'original', 'anime', 'series', 'watching', 'completion', 'So', 'finishing', 'FMA', 'Brotherhood', 'set', 'down', 'watch', 'entire', 'original', '51', 'ep', 'TV', 'series', 'can', 'recognize', 'how', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'series', 'when', 'originally', 'came', 'out', '2003', 'was', 'complete', 'manga', 'story', 'yet', 'having', 'watched', 'now', '2011', 'complete', 'manga', 'storyline', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'unimpressed', 'frankly', 'dissapointed', 'conclusion', 'original', 'series.As', 'many', 'know', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'followed', 'manga', 'storyline', 'was', 'written', 'time', 'stretched', 'out', 'that', 'material', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'go', 'about', '25', 'eps', 'time', 'had', 'produce', 'final', 'half', 'had', 'manga', 'storyline', 'base', 'so', 'credit', 'director', 'writer', 'crafted', 'original', 'storyline', 'taking', 'characters', 'far', 'different', 'direction', 'would', 'be', 'written', 'manga', 'easy', 'tell', 'how', 'storyline', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'up', 'went', 'along', 'frankly', 'meandered', 'was', 'quite', 'directionless', 'time', 'stuffed', 'pointless', 'filler', 'screenwriters', 'were', 'trying', 'decide', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'Compared', 'Brotherhood', 'were', 'many', 'gripes', 'had', '2nd', 'half', 'show:1', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'Brotherhood', 'where', 'longer', 'became', 'main', 'point', 'story', 'moved', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'grand', 'was', 'still', 'central', 'focus', 'somewhat', 'plot-driving', 'MacGuffin', 'original', 'series', 'Seriously', 'could', ""n't"", 'develop', 'story', 'further', 'end', 'main', 'villain', 'Dante', 'was', 'still', 'trying', 'produce', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'couldnt', 'make', 'own.2', 'Dante', 'Ok', 'main', 'villain', 'was', 'frankly', 'quite', 'weak', 'especially', 'compared', 'devious', 'genius', 'Father', 'second', 'series', 'motivations', 'were', 'small', 'scope', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'leading', 'even', 'more', 'pathetic', 'end.3', 'Homunculi', 'original', 'incarnations', 'had', 'interesting', 'points', 'including', 'personal', 'journey', 'Lust', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'dimensional', 'new', 'series', 'was', 'probably', 'done', 'was', 'such', 'prominent', 'character', 'series', 'found', 'original', 'incarnations', 'Pride', 'Sloth', 'Wrath', 'Envy', 'Greed', 'be', 'less', 'well', 'written', 'interesting.4', 'Ed', 'Al', 'was', 'imagination', ""'re"", 'main', 'heroes', 'far', 'more', 'annoying', 'immature', 'compared', 'characterization', 'Brotherhood', 'Ed', 'was', 'same', 'more', 'headstrong', 'bullheaded', 'original', 'series', 'Al', 'was', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'childish', 'short', 'sighted', 'Brotherhood', 'incarnation', 'Al', 'had', 'maturity', 'quick-thinking', 'intelligence', 'years', '10', 'year', 'old', 'sounding', 'voice', 'frankly', 'very', 'likeable', 'cool', 'character', 'original', 'series', 'Al', 'was', 'simply', 'child', 'thought', 'one.5', 'setting', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'world', 'parts', 'Amnestris', 'slivers', 'Ishbal', 'nations', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'nations', 'Drachma', 'Xing', 'dead', 'kingdom', 'Xerxes', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'fleshed', 'new', 'series', 'leading', 'much', 'more', 'vivid', 'rich', 'detailed', 'believable', 'world', 'original', 'series', 'barely', 'know', 'anything', 'history', 'culture', 'nation', 'where', 'series', 'place', 'frankly', 'end', 'series', 'learn', 'little', 'more', 'when', 'started.I', 'could', 'go', ""'ve"", 'made', 'point', 'pretty', 'clear', 'Brotherhood', 'really', 'lot', 'weaknesses', '2nd', 'half', 'original', 'series']",N/A

The final extra are trailers for Project Blue Earth SOS, One Piece, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, Glass Fleet, Ragnarok, Tsubasa, and Case Closed.When this DVD set was put together, FUNimation included the booklets from the seven individual discs that were released that included these episodes.  The first booklet starts with episode twenty-five, which was released on the first Fullmetal Alchemist box set.  Outside of that, everything else lines up.  Each booklet contains at least one write-up from someone involved with the series (the first six booklets contain a write-up from one of the Japanese voice actors, while the final booklet contains write-ups from two of the actors from the English dub who also directed the dubbing sessions).  There is also character information and images, information from the series, artwork, and episode write-ups.  The booklets are very well-done and contain a lot of information.The quality of the series continues to be very high on this box set.  That, along with the quality of the booklets, make this a release worth owning.  If you're a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist who wants to own the whole series on DVD, then this box set should be part of your anime collection.In order to write this review, I watched a copy of this DVD box set that was given to me as a gift by my husband.",5,The second half of the Fullmetal Alchemist anime series,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,2541,"['Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'four-disc', 'set', 'twenty-six', 'fifty-one', 'series', 'first', 'disc', 'contains', 'seven', 'episodes', 'second', 'disc', 'contains', 'six', 'episodes', 'third', 'disc', 'contains', 'six', 'episodes', 'fourth', 'disc', 'contains', 'six', 'episodes', 'commentary', 'episode', 'fifty-one', 'extras', 'discs', 'can', 'watch', 'English', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'can', 'choose', 'not', 'have', 'English', 'subtitles.The', 'first', 'extra', 'included', 'fourth', 'disc', 'thirty-one', 'minute', 'documentary', 'titled', 'Transmutation', 'Phenomenon', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'actors', 'English', 'dub', 'talk', 'various', 'aspects', 'series', 'characters.The', 'next', 'feature', 'labeled', 'Square', 'Enix', 'Commercial', 'two', 'minutes', 'ad', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', '2', 'Curse', 'Crimson', 'Elixir', 'videogame', 'third', 'special', 'feature', 'disc', 'textless', 'openings', 'closings', 'feature', 'two', 'openings', 'two', 'closings', 'series', 'first', 'box', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'English', 'subtitles', 'openings', 'closings', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'final', 'extra', 'are', 'trailers', 'Project', 'Blue', 'Earth', 'SOS', 'One', 'Piece', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'GT', 'Glass', 'Fleet', 'Ragnarok', 'Tsubasa', 'Case', 'Closed.When', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'FUNimation', 'included', 'booklets', 'seven', 'individual', 'discs', 'were', 'released', 'included', 'episodes', 'first', 'booklet', 'episode', 'twenty-five', 'was', 'released', 'first', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'box', 'set', 'everything', 'else', 'lines', 'up', 'booklet', 'least', 'one', 'write-up', 'someone', 'involved', 'series', 'first', 'six', 'booklets', 'contain', 'write-up', 'one', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'final', 'booklet', 'write-ups', 'two', 'actors', 'English', 'dub', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'dubbing', 'sessions', 'also', 'character', 'information', 'images', 'information', 'series', 'artwork', 'episode', 'write-ups', 'booklets', 'are', 'very', 'well-done', 'contain', 'lot', 'information.The', 'quality', 'series', 'be', 'very', 'high', 'box', 'set', 'quality', 'booklets', 'make', 'release', 'worth', 'owning', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'who', 'own', 'whole', 'series', 'DVD', 'then', 'box', 'set', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'anime', 'collection.In', 'order', 'write', 'review', 'watched', 'copy', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'given', 'gift', 'husband']",N/A

Some love this anime and honestly I don't know why. Aside from a few villians that make a few choice episodes worth watching it's 20+ episodes or so of ""let's get my brothers body back"" and ""I lost my right arm and leg"" over and over and over again. If there was every a story that I didn't care about in an anime this was definitely it. This might of been a more interesting anime if the characters didn't whine all the time. I especially can't stand the Suit of armor who sounds like a 5-6 year old kid. Maybe it's the voice acting or maybe he is supposed to be 5-6 I don't know. Between Cowboy Bebop and Full metal Alchemist I don't know which anime Cartoon network hasn't played to death. I wish they brought back Vash the Stampede or Wolf's Rain. This anime just doesn't do it for me. It's too cartoony, and then it tries to be extremely serious. It's like if you mixed ""Elfin Lied"" with ""One-Piece"" you'd end up with a silly cartoonish/and seriously violent Anime like this. Some people like the style... Honestly I never cared for it. As goofy as the characters are it seems they always try to make scenes to strike out emotions in the viewer. The only emotion these sentimental scenes brought out in me was anger...anger at the fact that these characters whine and cry about something every other episode.
