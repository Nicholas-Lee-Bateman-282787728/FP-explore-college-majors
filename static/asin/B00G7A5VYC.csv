I mean the elements were all there There was nothing really wrong with it. The production values were solid. The story was interesting and injected some novelty into a supernatural theme we've seen before. It presented the story well visually. But I felt the pull of boredom while watching it. I had to fight it off. That should NOT have been the case with everything I just said. The story line is my cup of tea. It was executed well. What happened? Someone should take another crack at this.

A couple of over-heated chicks and a morbidly obese character to play out a series of fat-jokes for comic relief; only there's no tension to be relieved from.  One would have to care about some person or some outcome to the plot to get tense.The hero of the picture has inherited the property from deceased family along with a legendary evil thing that we are introduced to at the beginning of the picture.  As a further twist, he is supposed to be ordained a Deacon in his church the following Monday.  So, a part of the plot is that the other couple has invited one of his old girl friends to come along to convince him that the sins of the flesh are more enticing than the Kingdom of Heaven.The acting is adequate enough to advance the plot but the story-line is full of flaws and improbabilities that interfere even in an atmosphere of voluntary suspension of disbelief.

I found this movie to be poorly written with poor acting, and very poor characters.  Yes, it's an &#34;indie&#34; movie, or what I call &#34;low budget&#34;, and glaring-ly so.  About the only good thing about it was that the female actors were stunningly beautiful, however beauty fades but it hardly makes up for the deficiencies in plot, character development, writing, and lack of acting skill.  Perhaps with a well-written script, these actors would be absolutely brilliant, but NO actor can do much with a story which simply makes no logical sense, lame writing, and flat characters.  Those who praised this movie must have been well paid to do that and probably didn't watch it!

1677276,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B00G7A5VYC,Ron,"[9, 10]","Bloodline isn't a bad indie flick. The main problem is with the writing and how the Native American curse was developed or rather the lack of developement.The story is about a native hate curse placed upon the early white settlers for stealing their land and murdering their people. A pendant is given to a white settler (Ethos) by the shaman he shoots to end the curse (doesn't make sense). The pendant is passed down to its current owner Brett Ethos who is a lost sole (suffering from nightmares) after loosing both of his parents 3 years before. Brett is just a few days away from taking his vows to become a priest when some old friends arrive and want to have a little fun.One of his friends accidentally drops a picture and discovers a hidden map, deed and a set of keys to his grandfathers cabin while in the attic of Bretts home. The gang wants to check it out, but Brett is dead set against it, but gives in. Bretts exgirlfriend is invited without his knowledge or consent and adds to the tension.Strange things start to happen before they even arrive at the cabin and Brett seems to be at the center of all the goings on and he also seems to be holding back on what he does or doesn't know. Now you have a pretty good idea of what this story is about without giving to much away.As I stated earlier the writing and the lack of development of just what this curse is and how to stop it if it can be stopped leaves a lot to be desired.The camers work is pretty good and the acting was all over the place from bad to decent. The direction was also spotty and inconsistent. The director was not getting even performances from the cast nor was the fright scenes very well executed.Two and at times three of Bretts friends are just plain annoying throughout the movie and left me not caring one way or another if they lived or died. Brett's performance as the lead was wooden and hurts the story somewhat along with the writing and direction.There is some foul language with a few F words, but overall not to bad. There is a non nude sex scene along with some drinking. The blood/gore is kept to a minimum with a decent head shot wound, but other than that not much of anything for this movie.",3,"""BLOODLINE SUFFERS FROM ANEMIA""",1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,2197,"['Bloodline', ""n't"", 'bad', 'indie', 'flick', 'main', 'problem', 'writing', 'how', 'Native', 'American', 'curse', 'was', 'developed', 'rather', 'lack', 'developement.The', 'story', 'native', 'hate', 'curse', 'placed', 'early', 'white', 'settlers', 'stealing', 'land', 'murdering', 'people', 'pendant', 'given', 'white', 'settler', 'Ethos', 'shaman', 'end', 'curse', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'pendant', 'passed', 'down', 'current', 'owner', 'Brett', 'Ethos', 'who', 'lost', 'sole', 'suffering', 'nightmares', 'loosing', 'parents', '3', 'years', 'before', 'Brett', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'away', 'taking', 'vows', 'become', 'priest', 'when', 'old', 'friends', 'arrive', 'want', 'have', 'little', 'fun.One', 'friends', 'accidentally', 'picture', 'hidden', 'map', 'deed', 'set', 'keys', 'grandfathers', 'cabin', 'attic', 'Bretts', 'home', 'gang', 'check', 'out', 'Brett', 'dead', 'set', 'Bretts', 'exgirlfriend', 'invited', 'knowledge', 'consent', 'tension.Strange', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'even', 'arrive', 'cabin', 'Brett', 'be', 'center', 'goings', 'also', 'be', 'holding', 'back', 'what', ""n't"", 'know', 'Now', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'story', 'giving', 'much', 'away.As', 'stated', 'earlier', 'writing', 'lack', 'development', 'just', 'what', 'curse', 'how', 'stop', 'can', 'be', 'stopped', 'lot', 'be', 'desired.The', 'camers', 'work', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'place', 'bad', 'decent', 'direction', 'was', 'also', 'spotty', 'inconsistent', 'director', 'was', 'not', 'getting', 'even', 'performances', 'cast', 'was', 'fright', 'scenes', 'very', 'well', 'executed.Two', 'times', 'three', 'Bretts', 'friends', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'movie', 'left', 'not', 'caring', 'one', 'way', 'lived', 'died', 'Brett', 'performance', 'lead', 'was', 'wooden', 'story', 'somewhat', 'writing', 'direction.There', 'foul', 'language', 'few', 'F', 'words', 'overall', 'not', 'bad', 'non', 'nude', 'sex', 'scene', 'drinking', 'blood/gore', 'kept', 'minimum', 'decent', 'head', 'shot', 'wound', 'other', 'not', 'much', 'anything', 'movie']",Bloodline
