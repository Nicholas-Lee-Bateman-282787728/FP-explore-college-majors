It was at a time when I was truelly discovering anime and after watching the awesome School Rumble and the kickass first episode of Claymore I found this show on there. It looked like an action anime at first. A promising one at that. I didn't know what fanservice was or that there were anime based off it at the time, so I walked into this show blind. Let me just say I don't mind fanservice in anime. Heck sometimes they lead to amusing moments, but this show just took it to a distasteful level. I watched Godannar for peek sake a fanservicey anime I actually kind of liked, but it was more tolerable than this showXD I wanted to stop watching, but because I'm tenacious and refuse to give up on show/movies even when thier bad until the end I decided to watch all episodes of Ikkis first season so I could come up with a full and fair opinion. With that said hears what I think. I also suggest you check out [...]. She basically sums up every problem I have with this anime and explains it much better.Plot??? Theres is no plot to this show. That whole BS about the Romance of the 3 kingdoms is just to cover up that this is a Hentai in disquise. Heck it should have been a Hentai so I wouldn't have found it on OnDemand and watched all 13 episodes. I don't even know why they gave this a action anime label. It barely has any action. The action it does have is 99.9% overshadowed by pantyshots or clothes disintergrating as if someone threw a bottle of acid on them.The fansevice is the worse I've seen in any show not because it completely overshadows the barely there plot, but because it fails completely due to how badly timed these moments are. I mean they unleash during moments where the scenes are ment to be completely seriousXD Not only that but none of the characters expecially the female characters are likable.The female protagnist is such an annoying b***. Her voice made me want to drive nails through my ears and its not just the english dub. I've seen stupid protagonist in anime, but thiers usually something charming and likable about them. With this chick I found nothing likable. The japenese sub is just as bad with her voice acting. I cared about none of the characters in this show at all. I've been on wikipedia and other sites trying to figure out what this shows about and still have no clue! How it got so popular I'll never know. You know what I know how. Its because a bunch of horny guys who love this kind of thing started a fanbase and watch mostly for the spankbase factors. If you love action anime skip this and go watch Claymore, Berserk, Gantz, or even Naruto!

The primary target audiances appears to be those with a fasination with teenagers panties,something this series has way too much of. The storyline does not work well with those not well-versed in Chinese/Japanese history nor with those that cannot grasp a concept that allows high school students to issuse ""imperial orders"" that must be obeyed by students under pain of death. The whole concept of high school students fighting to reinact events that happened more than a thousand years ago in another country and have no control over the outcomes isn't a Western concept. But, on the other hand, if all you want to watch is a dingbat bounce around and show her panties, well, this is your series. Admittedly,however, it is lively,funny and light-weighted enough to be enjoyable for those times you don't want to have to think. The storyline, however, should you wish to get really involved, is quite difficult to follow as it relates to the retelling of the 1000 year old Chinese history of the Three Kingdoms and how that history is now controling the actions of modern Japanese high school students. Nudity is minimal but there is some.Breasts are too frequently over sized,sometimes to a point of off-putting. Several of the females are quite attractivley done but the males are generaly average at best. Recommended for an evening of light viewing but don't expect any great enlightment.

Purchased the SAVE edition and it appears to be an edited version as other editions exist. That is why other reviews do not seem to accurately portray this series. No extras, no fan service, and the storyline is not all that interesting. Romance of the 3 kingdoms? BS. All that Chinese mythology/history gets is a few lines at the end of each episode. The beads and the history behind them get a total of 5 minutes explanation and that is cumulative over the 13 episodes. It also appears to take place not in Japan but on a peninsula (Korea?)and the episodes are 24 minutes long. Nothing in the series that deserves those 4 and 5 star ratings. But also nothing that was found offensive by those 1 and 2 star ratings either. Then again the SAVE edition that is currently available through Amazon is one version and there are others. The cover is also strange- no swords in series. All hand to hand fighting. The first arc (Ep. 1-7) on the first disc is the competition between the fighters. We are introduced to various characters and see many fights. Followed by a couple of downtime episodes, the episodes 10-13 (second disc 8-13) is another story arc where two villainous characters try to out maneuver each other by manipulating the fighters. The storyline focuses on three female fighters and the main one is the one on the cover, Hakafu. Not as good as the series Sekerei (5 stars) and was reluctant to try after reading other reviews but was on sale for ten dollars. Final verdict- OK but not recommended.

Ikki Tousen is the greatest (or worst) example of blatant fan service I have seen outside of a pornographic Hentai.One could easily watch the first few episodes and could think that blatant and somewhat creepy fan service is all Ikki Tousen offers, but something funny happened I got drawn into the story.In an alternate universe High Schools exist for fighting tournaments. The students wear teardrops shaped earrings that contain the essence of warriors from the Three Kingdoms period in China (also known as called the Six Dynasties) that followed the loss of de facto power by the Han Dynasty emperors. Each character in Ikki Tousen is predestined to the fate of their respective warrior.So a history lesson is mixed in between the shots of leave nothing to the imagination white panties. Does that really excuse a grown man watching topless high school girls beat each other up?... Probably not no.The animation is rudimentary and the episodes can be a touch repetitive. There is also that guy blushing sex humor I despise. Nevertheless, as soon as I start to fail to warm to the episodes something dramatic happens too break the pattern (The lesbian rape in Episode 6 Roku is a particular game changer.)So if you enjoy a good Anime and do not currently appear on any sex offender lists I can highly recommend Ikki Tousen. Give it a few episodes you may be drawn into the history and characterization. Alternatively, you might just be a sick in the head... different strokes and all that.",5,Ikki Tousen...

1239471,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B001US3XS2,maskedgamer,"[34, 40]","All I have to say is Season 2!I caught the english dub of Ikki Tousen after learning that Carrie Savage (voice actor that plays Hakafu) says that this was one of her most favorite anime's that she did in her career. If you know Carrie Savage's work than you know she has a very cute child like voice (check out Solty Rei). I like Carrie so I thought that I'd check it out.I will say that Ikki Tousen off the top isn't the type of anime I go for. This one is pretty much nonstop fan service. Yeah I enjoy some fan service in the likes of (Burst Angel) but this is no holes barred for 12 episodes. It's entertaining to see, but somehow it cheapens the serious plot.The plot of Ikki Tousen in itself is interesting. There is a group of teenagers that live out their lives as the reincarnations of fallen heroes from a story called ""The romance of 3 kingdoms"" they all posses the powers of the warriors from these stories, and live out thier lives according to the tales. However, they wish to defeat the fate that their incarnations fell victim to 1800 years ago. They go around fighting eachother only to solve the 1800 year old quarrels of their predecessors.Each group of fighters has a leader that they follow, and each group is classified by the highschool they represent. Some schools are friend,some schools are foe, but in the end they all share the same destinies as Kingdoms of long ago.Ikki tousen focuses on the story of a clumsy girl named Hakafu who likes going around fighting random people while wearing a very short skirt. In the series we follow Hakafu as she discovers herself and her new found friends. Through her journey she finds out that she's more special than she thinks she is. She is actually the reincarnation of a powerful warlord names Sonsaku Hakafu. What makes Ikki-Tousen entertaining is that Hakafu is just an airheaded 16 year old girl, but inside her is a powerful warlord that lies dormant.On Hakafu's journey you get to meet other characters with the same delimma Hakafu has. They are bound to the fates of their predessors wether they like it or not. Some of these characters accept the fate given to them, while others whos fates mean tradgedy try to fight against it. The story has a wierd pace as it jumps from Serious to Sexy to Hilarious then back again. Overall the first series (the English Box set) is pretty light, the series gets extremely serious and dark in Season 2(only available in Japanese).I thought the first season of Ikki Tousen was so so entertaining, but mainly because of the way the story was being told. The seriousness of the story doesn't shine through untill you get to watch the other seasons 2&3 then it all makes sense.Season 1 sort of paves the way for the plot, but with its strange style of giveing you Comedy,T&A;(you know what I mean), and Tradgedy all at once it can be very confusing. The story ties up in 12 episodes so it goes slow at first, then wraps up pretty quickly. You don't get to see so closely into the personalites of but a few fighters in the Season 1 box set, but you understand them more in the 2nd and 3rd seasons. Character development in the Season 1 set isn't really there, or better yet isn't shown as well as in the other seasons.Bottom line, as a stand alone season, The complete box set isn't worth your time. You won't get much of a story but you will get plenty of fan service if that's what your looking for.I reccomend this DVD be brought along with the season 2 and season 3 disc if you can get your hands on them. Ikki Tousen season 1 is pretty much only half a story without watching the other seasons.",5,"Cute girls, goofy characters, confusing plot...why 5 out of 5?",1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,3608,"['have', 'say', 'Season', '2', 'caught', 'english', 'dub', 'Ikki', 'Tousen', 'learning', 'Carrie', 'Savage', 'voice', 'actor', 'Hakafu', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'anime', 'did', 'career', 'know', 'Carrie', 'Savage', 'work', 'know', 'very', 'cute', 'child', 'voice', 'check', 'out', 'Solty', 'Rei', 'like', 'Carrie', 'thought', ""'d"", 'check', 'out.I', 'will', 'say', 'Ikki', 'Tousen', 'top', ""n't"", 'type', 'anime', 'go', 'one', 'pretty', 'much', 'nonstop', 'fan', 'service', 'Yeah', 'enjoy', 'fan', 'service', 'likes', 'Burst', 'Angel', 'holes', 'barred', '12', 'episodes', 'entertaining', 'see', 'somehow', 'serious', 'plot.The', 'plot', 'Ikki', 'Tousen', 'interesting', 'group', 'teenagers', 'live', 'out', 'lives', 'reincarnations', 'fallen', 'heroes', 'story', 'called', 'romance', '3', 'kingdoms', 'powers', 'warriors', 'stories', 'live', 'out', 'thier', 'lives', 'according', 'tales', 'However', 'wish', 'defeat', 'fate', 'incarnations', 'fell', 'victim', '1800', 'years', 'ago', 'go', 'fighting', 'eachother', 'only', 'solve', '1800', 'year', 'old', 'quarrels', 'predecessors.Each', 'group', 'fighters', 'leader', 'follow', 'group', 'classified', 'highschool', 'represent', 'schools', 'are', 'friend', 'schools', 'are', 'foe', 'end', 'share', 'same', 'destinies', 'Kingdoms', 'long', 'ago.Ikki', 'tousen', 'story', 'clumsy', 'girl', 'named', 'Hakafu', 'who', 'going', 'fighting', 'random', 'people', 'wearing', 'very', 'short', 'skirt', 'series', 'follow', 'new', 'found', 'friends', 'journey', 'out', 'more', 'special', 'actually', 'reincarnation', 'powerful', 'warlord', 'names', 'Sonsaku', 'Hakafu', 'What', 'Ikki-Tousen', 'entertaining', 'Hakafu', 'just', 'airheaded', '16', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'powerful', 'warlord', 'dormant.On', 'Hakafu', 'journey', 'get', 'meet', 'other', 'characters', 'same', 'delimma', 'Hakafu', 'are', 'bound', 'fates', 'predessors', 'like', 'not', 'characters', 'accept', 'fate', 'given', 'others', 'whos', 'fates', 'mean', 'tradgedy', 'try', 'fight', 'story', 'wierd', 'pace', 'Serious', 'Sexy', 'Hilarious', 'then', 'back', 'again', 'Overall', 'first', 'series', 'English', 'Box', 'set', 'pretty', 'light', 'series', 'extremely', 'serious', 'dark', 'Season', '2', 'only', 'available', 'Japanese', 'thought', 'first', 'season', 'Ikki', 'Tousen', 'was', 'so', 'so', 'entertaining', 'mainly', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'being', 'told', 'seriousness', 'story', ""n't"", 'shine', 'untill', 'get', 'watch', 'other', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'then', 'sense.Season', '1', 'sort', 'paves', 'way', 'plot', 'strange', 'style', 'giveing', 'Comedy', 'T', 'A', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Tradgedy', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'confusing', 'story', 'up', '12', 'episodes', 'slow', 'first', 'then', 'up', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'so', 'closely', 'personalites', 'few', 'fighters', 'Season', '1', 'box', 'set', 'understand', 'more', '2nd', '3rd', 'seasons', 'Character', 'development', 'Season', '1', 'set', ""n't"", 'really', 'there', 'better', 'yet', ""n't"", 'shown', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'seasons.Bottom', 'line', 'stand', 'alone', 'season', 'complete', 'box', 'set', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'story', 'will', 'get', 'plenty', 'fan', 'service', 'what', 'looking', 'for.I', 'reccomend', 'DVD', 'be', 'brought', 'season', '2', 'season', '3', 'disc', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'Ikki', 'Tousen', 'season', '1', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'story', 'watching', 'other', 'seasons']",N/A
