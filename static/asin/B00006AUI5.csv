710288,A21DZRY1MFMK1H,B00006AUI5,John Slade,"[0, 0]","Brilliant stroke to cast James Garner as Mark Twain. We've come to love Garner's bemused, slightly pained locutions almost as much as Twain's outrageous turns of phrase. Twain actually did perform whole chapters from ""Roughing It"" on his 1871-72 lecture tour, so it was an apt framing device to have the celebrated author offering it at his daughter Susie's Bryn Mawr graduation ceremony as a cautionary tale about his own hapless youth.  Twain's prose reels off Garner's tongue in a most promising way, his languorous narration leading us in and out of each episode thereafter.Charlie Martin Smith and his merry crew catch a right personable tone. Robin Donne is our gaping innocent abroad, with J.D. Nicholson as pal Higbie and the wonderful Wayne Robson who appears to be channeling Walter Brennan as sidekick Mr. Ballou. Just like in the novel, the characters are a pleasure to be with but the story meanders worse than Twain's beloved Mississippi. Unity of plot was never one of Twain's interests (which is why all movie versions of Huckleberry Finn invariably disappoint), and this picaresque adventure carries no underlying tension and a revolving cast of characters. The unhappy viewer above was right when he claimed several of the early scenes were ""quite unbelievable"" and ""over the top."" That is, of course, because Twain is a teller of tall tales, but the jokes in the early episodes were already old when Shakespeare used them, and too often fizzle before the punch line.But while 'Roughing It' doesn't hold up as a movie, it does make a tolerable good miniseries, so I'd advise watching it in installments. Sure, Twain's irony is sivilized some by Hallmark's brand of slapstick & sentimentality, but the episodes improve as they go. Two hours into the three-hour saga, Adam Arkin shows up to give a bone-honest performance as Henry, a man frozen with grief at the loss of his beautiful wife, and we're reminded of the terrible grief that Samuel Clemens had known, and would know again, repeatedly throughout his life. Cut to the audience cheering. The old man hugs his favorite daughter Susie at the fade-out, and for those who know the story, here Hallmark adds an ironic touch of its own. Susie never graduated from Bryn Mawr. She died of spinal meningitis while Twain was away lecturing in Europe. Of his four children only his firstborn, Clara, would survive him.",4,Comfortable as a good pair of slippers,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,2382,"['Brilliant', 'stroke', 'cast', 'James', 'Garner', 'Mark', 'Twain', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'Garner', 'bemused', 'slightly', 'pained', 'locutions', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'Twain', 'outrageous', 'turns', 'phrase', 'Twain', 'actually', 'did', 'perform', 'whole', 'chapters', 'Roughing', '1871-72', 'lecture', 'tour', 'was', 'apt', 'framing', 'device', 'have', 'celebrated', 'author', 'offering', 'daughter', 'Susie', 'Bryn', 'Mawr', 'graduation', 'ceremony', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'own', 'hapless', 'youth', 'Twain', 'prose', 'reels', 'Garner', 'tongue', 'most', 'promising', 'way', 'languorous', 'narration', 'leading', 'episode', 'thereafter.Charlie', 'Martin', 'Smith', 'merry', 'crew', 'catch', 'right', 'personable', 'tone', 'Robin', 'Donne', 'gaping', 'innocent', 'abroad', 'J.D', 'Nicholson', 'pal', 'Higbie', 'wonderful', 'Wayne', 'Robson', 'who', 'be', 'channeling', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'sidekick', 'Mr.', 'Ballou', 'Just', 'novel', 'characters', 'are', 'pleasure', 'be', 'story', 'meanders', 'worse', 'Twain', 'beloved', 'Mississippi', 'Unity', 'plot', 'was', 'never', 'one', 'Twain', 'interests', 'why', 'movie', 'versions', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'invariably', 'disappoint', 'picaresque', 'adventure', 'underlying', 'tension', 'revolving', 'cast', 'characters', 'unhappy', 'viewer', 'was', 'right', 'when', 'claimed', 'several', 'early', 'scenes', 'were', 'quite', 'unbelievable', 'top', 'course', 'Twain', 'teller', 'tall', 'tales', 'jokes', 'early', 'episodes', 'were', 'already', 'old', 'when', 'Shakespeare', 'used', 'too', 'often', 'fizzle', 'punch', 'line.But', ""'Roughing"", ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'movie', 'make', 'tolerable', 'good', 'miniseries', ""'d"", 'advise', 'watching', 'installments', 'Sure', 'Twain', 'irony', 'sivilized', 'Hallmark', 'brand', 'slapstick', 'sentimentality', 'episodes', 'improve', 'go', 'Two', 'hours', 'three-hour', 'saga', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'up', 'give', 'bone-honest', 'performance', 'Henry', 'man', 'frozen', 'grief', 'loss', 'beautiful', 'wife', ""'re"", 'reminded', 'terrible', 'grief', 'Samuel', 'Clemens', 'had', 'known', 'would', 'know', 'again', 'repeatedly', 'life', 'Cut', 'audience', 'cheering', 'old', 'man', 'favorite', 'daughter', 'Susie', 'fade-out', 'who', 'know', 'story', 'here', 'Hallmark', 'ironic', 'touch', 'own', 'Susie', 'never', 'graduated', 'Bryn', 'Mawr', 'died', 'spinal', 'meningitis', 'Twain', 'was', 'away', 'lecturing', 'Europe', 'four', 'children', 'only', 'firstborn', 'Clara', 'would', 'survive']",N/A

While I realize that snow will act as a blanket from the freezing weather, thus probably saving their lives, I cannot believe that the very morning sun would melt all the snow around them before they awake???* Three men can pull a wagon, uphill, and full of their equipment but two horses could not???Maybe I'm being a little nitpickitty, but if you have over two-and-a-half hours to spend then what they heck, give it a try.
