1366157,A1DDPWLITL7THF,B003UH3RJG,Customer from Quebec,"[4, 4]","I think Rob Halford was getting even better with age. His voice is becoming richer and more colourful. The way he sings on this DVD is almost unhuman.The setlist is perfect- even Never satisfied and White Heat Red Hot... Never heard them live before. The only thing missing is Betrayal- the best song from Crucible and all the bandmates say in the interview section that this is a great song to be performed live. And yet it's not on the setlist. But probably I want too much. The DVD is perfect as it is! I hope that Rob  will be alive and well for many years to come. They are very  few great vocalists  in metal  and we lost  Dio this year.  Unfortunately, there is no replacement in the young generation of bands where the vocals are often reduced  to  background.",5,Incredible!

The band and Rob are in peak form and the audio and video production is first rate (maybe a bit too much video angle switching).  Long live the Metal Godfather.,5,Wow...great production and awesome performance,1290470400,"11 23, 2010",2010,220,"['Long', 'time', 'Rob', 'Halford', 'fan', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'band', 'Rob', 'are', 'peak', 'form', 'audio', 'video', 'production', 'first', 'rate', 'maybe', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'video', 'switching', 'Long', 'live', 'Metal', 'Godfather']",Halford: Live in Anaheim
1366159,AV2EZQTY2L3ZA,B003UH3RJG,Richard Davis,"[4, 4]","First, I have been a Judas Pries and Rob Halford fan since 1981. I think he's easily of the best and most distinct vocalists on the planet. I didn't think Rock in Rio was a great dvd, and bought this one mostly based on the reviews here. I can't believe how many people said this had great production! The camera work stinks! It's like they gave cameras to a bunch of drunk teenagers. Too many out of focus shots, choppy zooming, and the video editing is very amateurish. The video itself is poor quality, especially on a big 58"" TV, very grainy and poor lighting doesn't help either. As to the ""great sound"" comments on this dvd, uhh, how many concert dvd's have they seen? I have a kick ass 7.1 system and the 5.1 sounded very thin, ended up watching in stereo as it sounded better, but by no means great. Compare this to the bonus dvd on the 30th anniversary British Steel album and you'll know what I mean. It sounds and looks a WHOLE lot better than this.All my criticisms aside, Rob and Co. are on fire and sound great, very tight! So my final score is 3 stars. I think it's fine as long as your expectations aren't too high like mine were. Maybe it didn't help that I put this in right after watching the new Heaven and Hell dvd.....now that was first rate!",3,A voice of reason,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,1264,"['First', 'have', 'been', 'Judas', 'Pries', 'Rob', 'Halford', 'fan', '1981', 'think', 'easily', 'best', 'most', 'distinct', 'vocalists', 'planet', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Rock', 'Rio', 'was', 'great', 'dvd', 'bought', 'one', 'mostly', 'based', 'reviews', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'said', 'had', 'great', 'production', 'camera', 'work', 'stinks', 'gave', 'cameras', 'bunch', 'drunk', 'teenagers', 'Too', 'many', 'focus', 'shots', 'choppy', 'zooming', 'video', 'editing', 'very', 'amateurish', 'video', 'poor', 'quality', 'especially', 'big', '58', 'TV', 'very', 'grainy', 'poor', 'lighting', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'great', 'sound', 'comments', 'dvd', 'uhh', 'how', 'many', 'concert', 'dvd', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'kick', 'ass', '7.1', 'system', '5.1', 'sounded', 'very', 'thin', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'stereo', 'sounded', 'better', 'means', 'great', 'Compare', 'bonus', 'dvd', '30th', 'anniversary', 'British', 'Steel', 'album', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'WHOLE', 'lot', 'better', 'this.All', 'criticisms', 'aside', 'Rob', 'Co.', 'are', 'fire', 'sound', 'great', 'very', 'tight', 'final', 'score', '3', 'stars', 'think', 'fine', 'as', 'long', 'expectations', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'high', 'mine', 'were', 'Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'put', 'right', 'watching', 'new', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'dvd', '..now', 'was', 'first', 'rate']",Halford: Live in Anaheim

That rock in Rio DVD sounded like crap compared to this DVD. This is killer stuff! What balls it takes to kick off a concert with 'Pain Killer'. That's how Halford kicked it off when I saw his band at the 'House of Blues' in Chicago 2 months before this concert was recorded. This is as good as any Priest DVD out there, and I really enjoy Live Vengeance '82 and Rising In The East! The guitar solo's in this are incredible! Check out the behind the head solo in 'Never Satisfied'. They did justice to all the Priest songs and Halford, Fight songs, etc. If you are a Priest fan (like I've been for 31 years) or a Halford fan in general, get this DVD, you won't be disappointed!
