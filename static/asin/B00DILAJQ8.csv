The resulting curse is whatever came out of their mouth as the last speck of dust from the urn landed....so they made the curse.  Since they thought it was a joke they came up with a ridiculous curse thus leading to an idiotic movie.  The movie is so idiotic is isn't very funny.  The movie tried too hard to be funny and it flopped in my opinion. I didn't care for the stereotypes the teenagers represented nor did I care much for the acting.  The only reason I am even giving it two stars is because I enjoyed Christopher Lloyd's character.  If you want a funny zombie movie I would recommend Shaun of the Dead, Juan of the Dead, or even Detention of the Dead.  Detention of the Dead boasts the same stereotypes but the acting is a touch better not much but just a wee bit.",2,it wasn't funny and it got idiotic,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,859,"['Group', 'friends', 'stereotypes', 'teenagers', 'break', 'old', 'urn', 'release', 'curse', 'resulting', 'curse', 'came', 'mouth', 'last', 'speck', 'dust', 'urn', 'landed', '.so', 'made', 'curse', 'thought', 'was', 'joke', 'came', 'up', 'ridiculous', 'curse', 'thus', 'leading', 'idiotic', 'movie', 'movie', 'so', 'idiotic', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'flopped', 'opinion', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'stereotypes', 'teenagers', 'represented', 'did', 'care', 'much', 'acting', 'only', 'reason', 'am', 'even', 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'enjoyed', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'character', 'want', 'funny', 'zombie', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Juan', 'Dead', 'even', 'Detention', 'Dead', 'Detention', 'Dead', 'same', 'stereotypes', 'acting', 'touch', 'better', 'not', 'much', 'just', 'wee', 'bit']",N/A

There's just something about combining hilarity with brutality and gore that brings a smile to my face...and not just because it's funny.  Obviously, I'm a huge fan of horror, but I also love to laugh.  So when the fine folks at Vivendi announced the release of DEAD BEFORE DAWN, I knew it was a flick that I wanted to check out.  And thankfully, it's just as funny as I hoped it would be.Before I continue, I do have to admit:  this film is not as funny as SHAUN OF THE DEAD or TUCKER & DALE VS. EVIL.  But those are two iconic pieces of cinema that are hard to beat.  DEAD BEFORE DAWN is a great film, though, and is filled with lots of laughs and great gore.  If you're looking for entertainment, then look no further.DEAD BEFORE DAWN is shot well and looks good from a production standpoint.  I wish I could have seen it in 3D, as I understand it's pretty spectacular.  But the 2D version is just as fun, I'm sure.The acting is pretty good, with Devon Bostick heading up a great cast.  I am particularly impressed to note that director April Mullen also starred alongside Bostick as one of the lead female roles.  Mullen is beautiful and talented, a multi-faceted actress and director that I hope to see more of in the future.The laughs come quick and heartily in DEAD BEFORE DAWN as well.  One of my favorite scenes that made me literally laugh out loud is when the fans and players at the football game all start to kill themselves.  The cheerleaders are kicking themselves in the face, while the football players impale themselves on the line markers.  It is hilarious!Although DEAD BEFORE DAWN might not be as funny as the prior two films I mentioned, it is still a great flick and one that deserves your attention.  It's chocked full of goofy laughs and grisly gore, so you can't ask for much more in a horror-comedy.  I recommend giving this one a shot.  It is available now in a variety of formats, but I suggest watching it on Blu-ray.  In addition to the great picture and sound, you get a nice bunch of Special Features, including a Behind the Scenes featurette, a Making Of documentary, and a Blooper Reel.",4,Horror-comedy done right,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,2249,"['love', 'horror-comedy', 'then', ""'re"", 'always', 'lookout', 'next', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'TUCKER', 'DALE', 'VS', 'EVIL', 'just', 'something', 'combining', 'hilarity', 'brutality', 'gore', 'smile', 'face', 'not', 'just', 'funny', 'Obviously', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'horror', 'also', 'love', 'laugh', 'So', 'when', 'fine', 'folks', 'Vivendi', 'announced', 'release', 'DEAD', 'BEFORE', 'DAWN', 'knew', 'was', 'flick', 'wanted', 'check', 'out', 'thankfully', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'hoped', 'would', 'be.Before', 'continue', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'TUCKER', 'DALE', 'VS', 'EVIL', 'are', 'two', 'iconic', 'pieces', 'cinema', 'are', 'hard', 'beat', 'DEAD', 'DAWN', 'great', 'film', 'filled', 'lots', 'laughs', 'great', 'gore', ""'re"", 'looking', 'entertainment', 'then', 'look', 'further.DEAD', 'DAWN', 'shot', 'well', 'good', 'production', 'standpoint', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seen', '3D', 'understand', 'pretty', 'spectacular', '2D', 'version', 'just', 'fun', ""'m"", 'sure.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'Devon', 'Bostick', 'heading', 'up', 'great', 'cast', 'am', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'note', 'director', 'April', 'Mullen', 'also', 'starred', 'alongside', 'Bostick', 'one', 'lead', 'female', 'roles', 'Mullen', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'multi-faceted', 'actress', 'director', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'future.The', 'come', 'quick', 'heartily', 'DEAD', 'BEFORE', 'DAWN', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'made', 'literally', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'fans', 'players', 'football', 'game', 'start', 'kill', 'cheerleaders', 'are', 'kicking', 'face', 'football', 'players', 'impale', 'line', 'markers', 'hilarious', 'DEAD', 'BEFORE', 'DAWN', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'funny', 'prior', 'two', 'films', 'mentioned', 'still', 'great', 'flick', 'one', 'attention', 'chocked', 'full', 'goofy', 'laughs', 'grisly', 'gore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'more', 'horror-comedy', 'recommend', 'giving', 'one', 'shot', 'available', 'now', 'variety', 'formats', 'suggest', 'watching', 'Blu-ray', 'addition', 'great', 'picture', 'sound', 'get', 'nice', 'bunch', 'Special', 'Features', 'including', 'Scenes', 'featurette', 'Making', 'documentary', 'Blooper', 'Reel']",N/A

This film was shot in real native 3d and looks great mostly on 3d blu ray which you can only get at best buy.  If you want real zemon's get 'demons' a 1985 horror film , it's on blu ray in the uk but  you need a all region blu ray player to watch it. It should come out eventually in the states on blu ray though. It's a true horror masterpiece and people die and become demons in it.  It's on dvd here though , it's such a great movie. THis however is a b movie horror comedy. I enjoyed it though; and the 3d looks awesome..  But if you want the 3d version you much get it from best buy , at the store , in the horror section! It wasn't even in the 3d section of blu rays!. YOu can't order this online or even on best buy .com as far as I know.  I collect 3d movies and therefore I had to get this no matter what.  I have a 135 of them on blu ray alone. But some are from Europe and such.  So if you collect 3d films then you want to go down to best buy and buy this.  It's not a great film but it's a fun and silly romp and if you like that sort of thing then you will enjoy this one.
