961588,A14OJS0VWMOSWO,B000CRR37E,Midwest Book Review,"[0, 1]","Whether you're an avid fan of DOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER or a complete newcomer, DOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER: BEST OF SEASON 2 is a top recommendation, gathering the best of the reality show's second season episodes - seven favorites selected by the Dog himself - from the series. For newcomers: there are other reality TV shows on bail-jumpers; but DOG comes with many differences. First, the posse is large-sized, heavily tattooed, and located in Hawaii, the island associated with peace and not crime. Second, the posse is deeply religious: a belief which extends to their actions as they capture bail-jumpers then embark on the brief roots of a conversion to a better life. Third, it's a family affair. Add a dose of humor to this unlikely mix of a family of bounty hunters and you have a riveting show which has just enough outside the norm of crime/police shows to keep audiences on their toes - and cognizant of the importance of adding social consciousness to the justice system, which is Dog's forte.Diane C.
