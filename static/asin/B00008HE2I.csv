I happened to see a clip of this movie floating around on youtube and it was pretty funny. so I decided to go ahead and buy it. When I finally recieved it and put it in the dvd player, i was instantly shocked at how it was filmed. The film looks as if it was video taped with a handycam and edited on windows movie maker! and that may be giving it too much credit! The scenes of the movie that i saw on youtube were infact the only funny parts of the movie. the rest was filled with ignorant wit and poor acting!

With that within reguard this one isn't bad. The lighting is good and stands out...it should it's sunlight. It was pretty funny and chances are I'm going to see it with the directors commentary...the drug scene I thought was a bit too long but beyond that it was good.BTW you can see the infamous clip if you go to google and type ""Where's my change *itch""",4,Low budget and brown but not bad..,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,469,"['interesting', 'advent', 'video', 'cameras', 'getting', 'cheaper', 'independent', 'films', 'get', 'made', 'masse', 'reguard', 'one', ""n't"", 'bad', 'lighting', 'good', 'out', 'should', 'sunlight', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'chances', 'are', ""'m"", 'going', 'see', 'directors', 'commentary', 'drug', 'scene', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'good.BTW', 'can', 'see', 'infamous', 'clip', 'go', 'google', 'type', 'Where', 'change', '*itch']",Livin' Tha Life
742847,A96JD9312DHWC,B00008HE2I,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[3, 3]","Being low budget isn't the mark of many a good movie, and having defects in the plots doesn't normally allow one to succeed. In fact, this movie, through that combination, will be considered a failure to a plethora of people watching and shouldn't be checked out by everyone. Many will see this movie, touted as a mixture of How High and the Friday series, notice that it was made in the low finance world outside of the monster money movies, and they will scoff at it. And rightly so if they picked it up for these reasons, because it is none of the above. Unfortunately for people who leave the setting angry, the scoffing misses out on something else the movie has; the essence of what can only be called humor.Through campy dialog, streams of profanity, a variety of strange twists, and ""gangsta"" cracks, this movie follows the lives of two ""thugs"" trying to make their way through a jobless life. They happen through the day in a fashion that can only be consider disturbingly surreal, with one motion leading to another motion until they end up with a dead crack addict in their trunk and need a way to dispose of the body. So, how does one dispose of a body like that? By getting sidetracked in a way that only those two can.They find themselves all sorts of political and social issues that are important to us all, confronting sexual issues like the acquisition of undergarb sealife and the ways to make means by ""jacking up"" people, letting things roll on and on until they seem out of control.And it only goes further.Before you buy this movie, be warned. It is very low quality, has no actors you'll see again, and it has some sound problems. It also flows out-of-control, much like life does in an unstructured setting, and people who don't appreciate humor for humor and find language, sexuality, and anything else that can be joked about offensive don't want this.If you still want to approach it after these warnings, however, then go rent it, don't expect anything, and you might find yourself laughing.And that's the point of all stand-up comedy that people buy, spending just as much as this to watch on DVD, and it has no budget as well. And it offers a whole lot less in the realm of situational laughtracks.",4,A Place to Place the Bodies Life Births,1064966400,"10 1, 2003",2003,2229,"['Being', 'low', 'budget', ""n't"", 'mark', 'many', 'good', 'movie', 'having', 'defects', 'plots', ""n't"", 'normally', 'allow', 'one', 'succeed', 'fact', 'movie', 'combination', 'will', 'be', 'considered', 'failure', 'plethora', 'people', 'watching', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'checked', 'out', 'everyone', 'Many', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'touted', 'mixture', 'How', 'High', 'Friday', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'low', 'finance', 'world', 'monster', 'money', 'movies', 'will', 'scoff', 'rightly', 'so', 'picked', 'up', 'reasons', 'none', 'above', 'Unfortunately', 'people', 'who', 'leave', 'setting', 'angry', 'scoffing', 'out', 'something', 'else', 'movie', 'essence', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'humor.Through', 'campy', 'dialog', 'streams', 'profanity', 'variety', 'strange', 'twists', 'gangsta', 'cracks', 'movie', 'lives', 'two', 'thugs', 'trying', 'make', 'way', 'jobless', 'life', 'happen', 'day', 'fashion', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'consider', 'disturbingly', 'surreal', 'one', 'motion', 'leading', 'motion', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'crack', 'addict', 'trunk', 'need', 'way', 'dispose', 'body', 'So', 'how', 'one', 'dispose', 'body', 'getting', 'sidetracked', 'way', 'only', 'two', 'can.They', 'find', 'sorts', 'political', 'social', 'issues', 'are', 'important', 'confronting', 'sexual', 'issues', 'acquisition', 'undergarb', 'sealife', 'ways', 'make', 'means', 'jacking', 'up', 'people', 'letting', 'things', 'roll', 'seem', 'control.And', 'only', 'further.Before', 'buy', 'movie', 'be', 'warned', 'very', 'low', 'quality', 'actors', ""'ll"", 'see', 'again', 'sound', 'problems', 'also', 'out-of-control', 'much', 'life', 'unstructured', 'setting', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'humor', 'humor', 'find', 'language', 'sexuality', 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'joked', 'offensive', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'this.If', 'still', 'want', 'approach', 'warnings', 'however', 'then', 'go', 'rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'might', 'find', 'laughing.And', 'point', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'people', 'buy', 'spending', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'watch', 'DVD', 'budget', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'lot', 'less', 'realm', 'situational', 'laughtracks']",Livin' Tha Life
