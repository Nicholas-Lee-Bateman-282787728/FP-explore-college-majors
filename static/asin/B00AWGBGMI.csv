Instead, they encounter a Hills Have Eyes reject with nasey teeth and a really bad anger management problem.  Ho hum....you've seen it all before and there's nothing particularly original to distinguish this half-baked Indie.  Why can't it be five octogenarians trapped in an abandoned nursing home?

She loads up the van with her friends and not her ex-bf Brad (Trinidad Amaya) and heads out to Copper Queen hospital in remote Arizona. Here they have a hospital which experimented on children as we get the story told to us by an elderly woman, the low point in the film. Once the crew gets to the hospital creepy things happen and it turns into a screaming senseless gore fest.The film seemed slow to develop. The driving scene proved to be a waste of dialog. Once they get inside, the film becomes a combination of hand held cameras and badly shot scenes from the worse angels...like Russian porn. Room for improvement.I had no issue with sound. In fact I had to turn mine down.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. No nudity. Recommend as a Redbox rental.",3,I'LL HAVE YOU HOME IN TIME FOR SOUTH PARK,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,847,"['Maya', 'Megan', 'Davis', 'student', 'Thorazine', 'junkie', 'doing', 'film', 'nonfiction', 'film', 'class', 'up', 'van', 'friends', 'not', 'ex-bf', 'Brad', 'Trinidad', 'Amaya', 'out', 'Copper', 'Queen', 'hospital', 'remote', 'Arizona', 'Here', 'have', 'hospital', 'experimented', 'children', 'get', 'story', 'told', 'elderly', 'woman', 'low', 'point', 'film', 'crew', 'hospital', 'creepy', 'things', 'happen', 'screaming', 'senseless', 'gore', 'fest.The', 'film', 'seemed', 'slow', 'develop', 'driving', 'scene', 'proved', 'be', 'waste', 'dialog', 'get', 'inside', 'film', 'combination', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'badly', 'shot', 'scenes', 'worse', 'angels', 'Russian', 'porn', 'Room', 'improvement.I', 'had', 'issue', 'sound', 'fact', 'had', 'turn', 'mine', 'down.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Recommend', 'Redbox', 'rental']",Animus
