1212743,A20CSFERC3VINT,B001L1S1PI,"80s fan ""Adam""","[1, 4]",Even after 20 years the show is still good and funny. I just wish this DVD came with some more special features. I am still glad to have it because it is still a very funny show. I'm sure it will get re release in the future but for now this will have to do. Also the packaging is not that good but I guess it could be worst. I think 4 out of 5 is fair and I hope it still sells OK. Enjoy!,4,Good season but it needs more,1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,389,"['Even', '20', 'years', 'show', 'still', 'good', 'funny', 'just', 'wish', 'DVD', 'came', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'am', 'still', 'glad', 'have', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'show', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'get', 're', 'release', 'future', 'now', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'Also', 'packaging', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'guess', 'could', 'be', 'worst', 'think', '4', '5', 'fair', 'hope', 'still', 'OK', 'Enjoy']",The Simpsons: Season 20
1212744,AKJONKU5DALMF,B001L1S1PI,"A.Marte ""Supernatural  Lover""","[2, 3]","I love the Simpsons, I can dare say it is my favorites show, period. I cannot bare to mark it low just based on how greedily Fox chose to release this season. I cannot lie, some of the episodes were not that good, and I find myself watching season 1-10 more often; but my love has not wavered.Comparing this season to previous seasons of the Simpson would result in a lower rating. The thing is it is still better than 75% of sitcoms and pretty much every other animation. The writers seem to be tying hard, whereas in other season laughs came freely; I got the feeling everything was forced. Some episodes seem like they should have been featured on seasons way before this, they were really stale. It seems after season 17 or so, they started to incorporate more episodes centered around Lisa; they should know by now Lisa is not funny, she is just annoying. There are still plenty of parodies and hi-jinks for Homer to be subjected to.The way in which this season was released was just wrong. It cost more than any other season that has been released but features nothing special. Half of the season is regular and then it shifts into HD; why not just do all the episodes that way upon release? I know it is suppose to be a milestone ""the 20th season"" but it was lackluster and if they intend on re-releasing this season with all the extras; they suck.",4,Can't bear to rate it lower........,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,1355,"['love', 'Simpsons', 'can', 'dare', 'say', 'favorites', 'show', 'period', 'can', 'not', 'bare', 'mark', 'low', 'just', 'based', 'how', 'greedily', 'Fox', 'chose', 'release', 'season', 'can', 'not', 'lie', 'episodes', 'were', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'find', 'watching', 'season', '1-10', 'more', 'often', 'love', 'not', 'wavered.Comparing', 'season', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Simpson', 'would', 'result', 'lower', 'rating', 'thing', 'still', 'better', '75', '%', 'sitcoms', 'pretty', 'much', 'other', 'animation', 'writers', 'seem', 'be', 'tying', 'hard', 'whereas', 'other', 'season', 'laughs', 'came', 'freely', 'got', 'feeling', 'everything', 'was', 'forced', 'episodes', 'seem', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'featured', 'seasons', 'way', 'were', 'really', 'stale', 'season', '17', 'so', 'started', 'incorporate', 'more', 'episodes', 'centered', 'Lisa', 'should', 'know', 'now', 'Lisa', 'not', 'funny', 'just', 'annoying', 'are', 'still', 'plenty', 'parodies', 'hi-jinks', 'Homer', 'be', 'subjected', 'to.The', 'way', 'season', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'just', 'wrong', 'cost', 'more', 'other', 'season', 'been', 'released', 'nothing', 'special', 'Half', 'season', 'regular', 'then', 'HD', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'do', 'episodes', 'way', 'release', 'know', 'suppose', 'be', 'milestone', '20th', 'season', 'was', 'lackluster', 'intend', 're-releasing', 'season', 'extras', 'suck']",The Simpsons: Season 20

It was one of the only shows that I ""had to be home to watch"" as a teen.  Whenever I have money I buy the DVD box sets and watch them ad nauseum.  People hate watching the show with me because I have so many episodes memorized.  I can think of a relevant Simpsons quote or episode for any situation.  I LOVE the Simpsons.  Despite my limited funds (i.e.: I can't afford cable), I have scraped together enough over the years to buy the first 13 seasons, which are all impeccable, in my opinion.  Buy them, they are awesome.  You will love them.However... I recently purchased the 20th Season of my favourite show, (it was on sale! woot!) and couldn't wait to get home to watch it.  And, well, really I don't even know what to make of it.  Product placement, completely ridiculous and stupid plot twists, and - bottom line - NOT FUNNY AT ALL.  I'm usually smiling and chuckling my way through every episode, filling in half the dialogue, etc.  Not with Season 20.  It's a rare thing if I even crack a smile during an entire episode of Season 20.  My husband and I were pointing out funny parts to each other, but not in our usually ""man, that whole scene rocks!"" kind of way, but in the rare-bird-siting way (""Hey! That part was kind of funny!""  ""Yeah, kind of!"")  I actually fell asleep watching one I hadn't seen before!  This is unheard of!!!!  It was like a completely different show.  An unfunny, lame and stupid version of the Simpsons.  What happened??As someone who's been in love with the Simpsons for over 20 years I feel completely betrayed.  As I said, I can't afford cable, so I haven't seen many recent episodes, but I've been steadily buying the box sets for the past 5 years (and watching them so often that they're starting to skip) and now I don't know what to do.*********Could somebody please tell me at which season the creators of the Simpsons decided to completely sell out and destroy my favourite show, so that I can stop buying the box sets?  Seasons 1-13 are excellent.  Season 20 blows big fat hairy goats.  So somewhere between Seasons 13 and 20 something happened.  Please, SOMEBODY tell me when this grotesque transformation took place so that I can halt my purchasing after the last good season.*********Thank you",1,What the hell am I watching?

1212755,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001L1S1PI,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 5]","""The Simpsons"" makes its debut on Blu-ray!  With the 20th Year anniversary of ""The Simpsons"" completed earlier in Spring 2009 and now on their 21st season, FOX has taken a break from its consecutive DVD release and instead of releasing the 13th Season, to coincide with the 20th Anniversary special shown on television, ""The Simpsons 20 Years - The Complete Twentieth Season"" is being released Blu-ray and DVD.Since 1989, ""The Simpsons"" which was created by Matt Groening and is currently on its 20th Season on FOX. Derived from shorts shown on the The Tracey Ullman Show back in 1987, ""The Simpsons"" has broadcast over 450 episodes and has amassed 24 Primetime Emmy Awards, 26 Annie awards and a Peabody Award. And also has received the recognition of being America's longest running sitcom and animated program. Needless to say, the animated series is part of American pop culture and inspired many trends in American culture.""The Simpsons 20 Years - The Complete Twentieth Season"" includes the following episodes on two Blu-ray discs:Disc One:* EPISODE 421 - Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes - Homer and Flanders become bounty hunters who catch bail jumpers.  Meanwhile, Marge gets a job at a bakery, but doesn't know its an erotic bakery.* EPISODE 422 - Lost Verizon - Bart wants a cell phone badly and somehow ends up with Dennis Leary's cell phone.* EPISODE 423 - Double, Double, Boy in Trouble - Bart encounters a rich version of himself, Simon Woosterfield and both trade places.* EPISODE 424 - Treehouse of Horror XIX - It's the annual Halloween episode and features a Transformers parody, a killer Homer and a parody of ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"".* EPISODE 425 - Dangerous Curves - Homer and Marge celebrate their dating years and realize that their past was full of lies.* EPISODE 426 - Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words - Lisa becomes obsessed with crossword puzzles and enters a competition.* EPISODE 427 - Mypods and Boomsticks - Bart has a new friend who is Muslim and Homer thinks his friend and the family are terrorists.* EPISODE 428 - The Burns and the Bees - Mr. Burns his building a new stadium where Lisa is taking care of a a bee colony.* EPISODE 429 - Lisa the Drama Queen - Lisa and her friend Juliet begin writing stories about a fantasy world.Disc Two:* EPISODE 430 - Take My Life, Please - Homer's high school rival Vance is being honored for the Springfield Wall of Fame.

The PQ is a bit blurry, there is combing and aliasing and  for the most part, it's not going to look too great.  But once you switch to disc 2 and that is where you notice a huge difference as the series is now 1080p.  The 12 episodes are now widescreen and colors are vibrant, cleaner and look very good (not perfect as it has its share of aliasing but still much better than what we see from the first disc).So, you're going to get inconsistent picture quality on both discs but for fans of ""The Simpsons"", the fact the show has gone HD and widescreen is wonderful.As for audio, the episodes are presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish, Portuguese and French Dolby Digital 5.1.  The show is front and center-channel driven and dialogue and music is crystal clear.  Certain sounds really jump out from the front channels (and I never heard ""The Simpsons"" television series this good before) and there is occasional LFE but this is the best that I have heard the series sound.  It would have been great if it utilized the surround channels but for an animated television series, it's a pretty good lossless soundtrack.  Not too immersive but ""The Simpsons"" fans should be happy with the shows entry to Blu-ray.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Simpsons 20 Years - The Complete Twentieth Season"" comes with a four minute special feature titled ""The Twentieth Anniversary Special Sneak Peak by Morgan Spurlock"".  The Twentieth Anniversary Special shown on television is not included on this Blu-ray release nor are the usual commentary tracks, storyboards or extra features typically seen in Simpsons releases.JUDGMENT CALL:I have to say that when I first heard that ""The Simpsons 20 Years - The Complete Twentieth Season"" would be released on Blu-ray, you can't help but be excited.  Especially if you grew up along with the series.But I have to admit that I was a bit surprised with this Blu-ray release because every release that we had of ""The Simpsons"" has been loaded with special features.  Tons of audio commentary, fun menus, deleted scenes, commercials, storyboards and featurettes.  For some reason, this latest box set for Blu-ray (and DVD) are devoid of special features.  Yes, there is a promo for the Morgan Spurlock Fox special but it's barely four minutes long and the special is not even included in the release.  So, this was a bummer for this release.As for the Blu-ray, as mentioned with the picture quality, the video is going to be inconsistent from disc 1 to disc 2 because they were presented differently but the fact that they made the shift to HD is great and the fact that the final 12 episodes look so vibrant with its colors will definitely make the Blu-ray fans of ""The Simpsons"" happy.  While hardcore Blu-ray fans will be a bit upset because of the PQ differences.  But the HD presentation of those episodes and to hear the lossless audio, definitely brings this new added depth to the series.For over 21-years even since ""The Tracy Ullman Show"", I've found ""The Simpsons"" to still be entertaining, witty, fun and just enjoyable.  I know that there are fans who have had issues with the quality of the show but for me, I'm still watching it and as long as each episode remains fresh and still manages to be fun and entertaining, I've been cool with it.  I do feel that the series now in HD and also being available on Blu-ray is definitely a positive step forward and knock on wood, the next Blu-ray release comes with plenty of special features, all in 1080p and a more immersive soundtrack.Overall, if you are a hardcore fan of the series, ""The Simpsons 20 Years - The Complete Twentieth Season"" is worth picking up!",3,"Blu-ray: ""The Simpsons"" TV

In the process, they skimped on all the extra features previous DVDs contained that made them worth the money.  As documented by their recent 20-year anniversary special, The Simpsons has a global fan base.  And how is that extensive fan base treated?  Like FOX could care less about us.  Not only are we insulted with poorly designed menus and lacking commentary, deleted scenes, etc., they also decided to package it in the self-destroying cardboard casing they've used (to much public dismay and outcry) in the previous few packages.  As a big fan of the show, I had decided long ago I would buy every season, even the ones after 10 that weren't that funny, just because I wanted to support the franchise.

1212771,AJE4MXRQ5W9JU,B001L1S1PI,John W. Allen,"[3, 5]","I consider myself to be a dedicated fan of The Simpsons. I have watched it since it's first airing more than 20 years ago. Suffice to say, when the 20th Anniversary Edition was being released, I was excited. I knew they were doing this particularly for the switch to HD, but I was also excited about having a new season in my hot little hands. Unfortunately, the release was shortsighted and poorly executed. Firstly, the packaging is terrible, just as Seasons 12 and 13. It is difficult to retrieve discs from the cardboard slots, and I swear every time I remove the disc I'm afraid it's going to get scratched. Along with this, the outer packaging is annoying. You have the white sleeve, which is easy enough to remove, but then the cardboard case is closed on both sides. You have to open the flap, remove the accordion DVD holder inside, and then fight with the tight cardboard sleeves to remove the disc itself. It seems as if the creators almost want to keep me from watching their later seasons. It may not be so, but it does feel that way.Secondly, the features are non-existent. I knew this when purchasing the DVD set, but I didn't know that ""No commentaries"" also meant absolutely nothing at all but a sneak peak trailer of a TV event I watched before the set was released. What kind of thinking is this? Even if it's rushed, they can't put anything else on the DVD to let the fans know they still care? Honestly, if they could put a sneak peak trailer on the set, why not a few text bios? How long could it possibly take to add a handful of text bios, even about just the main characters? This lack of foresight has cost them some of my good will. I love The Simpsons, but I don't tolerate being cheated or taken for granted.Now, onto the series itself.I love The Simpsons, I do. They have been a constant in my life since I was a child, and they still make me laugh. Yes, the quality has slid somewhat, but to me, a ""bad"" Simpsons episode is still better than most ""good"" sitcoms. I think the problem lies in the fact that we've seen it all before. We know what's going to happen, so the best thing is to just take pleasure in the characters themselves. Unfortunately for some, myself included, the characters have been given the bum's rush as well. Homer went from a deeply flawed but caring father and husband to an apathetic shadow of his former self. He went from ""bumbling, good natured oaf"" to sadistic, selfish egotist. Why did that have to happen? The great thing about cartoons is that they don't age, that they don't need to face the realities we do every day. I love The Simpsons because they could take an unpleasant reality and turn it on it's head. Homer having a heart attack shouldn't be a topic found to be funny in most sitcoms, but on The Simpsons, the execution was so well done that I couldn't help but laugh at the situation. That is excellent writing. It's the mark of a truly great production. I haven't seen that kind of heart from The Simpsons for years, including the 20th season (this set). However, that does seem to be changing now, and I look forward to a rejuvenated Simpsons.To summarize:* Fair to middling episode quality (for the Simpsons)* Terrible Packaging* No extra features whatsoeverIs it worth $19.99 (pricing at the time of this review)?

1212773,AEZ55FCD5XJD6,B001L1S1PI,Joseph Torcivia,"[0, 0]","The Simpsons: The Complete 20th Season - Blu-Ray Edition(Released January 12, 2010 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment)Another Looong DVD Review by Joe TorciviaOnce upon a time, when reviewing The Simpsons on DVD, I wrote the following:If there were a single DVD product that consistently stands above the rest, it would be each and every release of THE SIMPSONS!Indeed, every review I could write would sound the same.  The episodes are always great, and no series offers more in the way of extra features and general quality!That was then.  This is now...The Simpsons: The Complete 20th Season - Blu-Ray Edition marked my first Blu-ray DVD purchase.  I knew going in that about only HALF the 20th Season was produced for HD broadcast and, thus, only half the set would be fully Blu-ray capable.  To view this any other way would be unfairly critical.  However, many unexpectedly unpleasant surprises were to be found therein.Which takes us to our customary list of CONS and PROS.The CONS:Only Half a Season of HD:  But, again, this is known to any fan of the show.The Special Features:  Each previous SIMPSONS set offered most if not all of the following:* Commentaries with writers, directors, producers, and actors on EVERY EPISODE.* Creator Matt Groening's Introductory Feature for each Season Set - discussing the high points and guest stars.* Animated menus that reflected the contents of each disc.* A detailed and lavishly illustrated BOOKLET, listing the contents of the set, original airdates, and other notable aspects of each episode.* Deleted scenes. Offered as ""Stand Alone"" (with optional commentary) or, with a touch of your remote, integrated into their intended spots as part of the episodes.* Selected storyboards and animatics.* Easter Eggs, offering hidden surprises.Unless I've yet to uncover some E-Eggs, none of this is included with The Simpsons: The Complete 20th Season - Blu-Ray Edition!There is a bare-bones listing of episode titles, listed by disc, and a PROMO for FOX TV's Simpsons 20th anniversary special.  Not the special, mind you.  That might have been welcome.  Nope!  We get only the promo FOR the special, which is billed as a ""Special Feature"". Nothing else!The PROS:The Half Season of HD:  The Standard Definition episodes of The Simpsons: The Complete 20th Season - Blu-Ray Edition look great!  The High Definition episodes, however, fill the entire screen with bright, sharp, and vivid colors!  It is like no Simpsons I've ever seen before!The Packaging:  The Season 11 and Season 12 sets were simply awful in their packaging.  The packaging for The Simpsons: The Complete 20th Season - Blu-Ray Edition has reversed that unfortunate trend and provided more conventional and sturdy protective packaging.And, of course, the biggest PRO of any Simpsons set...The Episodes:  Over and over, the Internet continues to drone on about how The Simpsons is no longer funny.  Not so, as this current batch proves.Here are the some highlights (Beware of VERY MILD SPOILERS):""HD"" denotes the episode is in High Definition.""Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes"" Marge unknowingly works for an erotic bakery, while Homer and Flanders become bounty hunters!  What a way to start a season!""Treehouse of Horror XIX"" Voting machines with minds of their own, transforming lethal household objects, dead celebrity product endorsements, an unbelievable send-up of ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown!"", and even a cleverly constructed parody of the opening of MAD MEN are among the delights of our annual Halloween episode.""Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words"" Lisa finds a new passion - The New York Times Crossword Puzzle. Times Crossword editor Will Shortz appears as himself.  Perhaps ""Hard Luck Gil's"" only great moment!""Mypods and Broomsticks"" Two great stories in one episode. Lisa overindulges in her new ""myPod"", receives a massive bill for music downloads, and pleads with ""Steve Mobs"" (at his idyllic, underwater compound) to forgive the debt.  Bart befriends an Arabic boy, and Homer immediately suspects his father of being a terrorist.  Unfortunately for all, he sets out to prove it... as only he can!  Great climax!""The Burns and the Bees"" Lisa establishes a bee colony and Mr. Burns plans to build a mega-arena for his new professional basketball team on that very site.  Opens with a special Christmas / Holiday / Winter variation of the usual opening title sequence.  Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and sportscaster Marv Albert play themselves.""Take My Life, Please"" (HD) Homer blames his failure to be elected High School Class President as the reason he is not included in Springfield's ""Wall of Fame"" - an all-inclusive monument to the town's achievers that includes even Poochie!  This is the first HD episode.""How the Test was Won"" (HD) Lisa frets over a standardized test. Skinner and his school's underachievers have an adventure in Capital City. Homer forgets to mail his property insurance payment.  This bit culminates in a hilarious climax that injures a passing Mr. Burns... just in the nick of time for the insurance to pay the damages.""Gone Maggie Gone"" (HD) With Marge temporarily blinded, Homer accidentally allows Maggie to be claimed by an ancient order of nuns.  Lisa infiltrates the order to reclaim her sister, leading to a ""Di Vinci Code-like"" adventure concerning one of Springfield's landmarks.  Hysterical ending, confirming everything we've ever suspected about Bart.""In the Name of the Grandfather"" (HD) Homer and Grandpa Simpson end up owning an old Irish Pub, and try to make it work in modern day Ireland.  Lots of great ""Irish parody"" names of well known chain stores, businesses, and products.""Four Great Women and a Manicure"" (HD) Marge takes Lisa for her first nail salon manicure.  This serves as a backdrop for the pair to tell female-centric stories.  Highlight: The story of Lisa as ""Snow White"", with Homer, Moe, Barney, Lenny, Kearney, Dr. Hibbard, and Mr. Burns as the dwarfs - with a great ""Hi-Ho"" parody song and the expected jabs at Disney lawyers.""Coming to Homerica"" (HD) The Swedes of neighboring Ogdenville invade Springfield when O-ville's barley-based economy tanks.  At first, they are welcome. But soon, Springfield is gripped by anti ""Barley Jack"" hysteria. A great commentary on the nation's immigration controversy.OVERALL:  The Simpsons: The Complete 20th Season - Blu-Ray Edition delivers a remarkable amount of entertainment and laughs for a series that's been around, non-stop for two decades.  And the half season's worth of HD episodes are magnificent!However, weighing this set's disappointments vs. the high standards that the series sets have previously maintained, I cannot give it a high recommendation.Enjoy it for what it is, but never lose sight of what it could have been.

1212782,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001L1S1PI,Mark Turner,"[3, 8]","In 1989 a yellow toned family appeared on our TV screens on the little seen new network known as Fox TV. Can it really be 20 years since we first got a glimpse of the Simpson family? Apparently so as Fox releases THE SIMPSONS COMPLETE 20TH SEASON.What began as a series of clips in the now defunct TRACY ULLMAN SHOW, little snippets created by Matt Groening, a comic strip creator who drew and wrote LIFE IN HELL, the Simpson family kept growing in popularity. The antics of brat boy Bart, his stupendously idiotic father Homer, loving mother Marge, intelligent sister Lisa and silent little sis Maggie have garnered fans across the world. So much so that THE SIMPSONS is now the longest running prime time series in history, surpassing even M*A*S*H and GUNSMOKE.So now comes the 20th season, certainly a groundbreaking event for any show. But even more so for one that is animated. There are, or at least prior to this series, few prime time animated series in the history of television. THE SIMPSONS opened that door for all that have followed.So what does this season have to offer? Plenty. There are still the adventures of problem child Bart as he finds more ways to get into trouble and continues to fill the chalkboard at the beginning of nearly every episode. Homer still does some of the stupidest things seen on TV. But the series offers so much more than just what is visible on the surface.THE SIMPSONS has always taken a look at society and mocked it. This season is no different. Perhaps one of the best send ups of society is the look they take at Apple and people who feel the need to take on every product that they distribute. Excuse me, its not Apple but Mapple. Heaven knows no one could tell what was being made fun of here.Included is the 20th season episode of ""Treehouse Of Terror"", THE SIMPSONS annual Halloween episode. Unfortunately for me this one didn't live up to previous seasons outings for this holiday. Sure it has a few moments, but it's been better.One of the things quite visible in this season is perhaps what's made the Simpsons one of the most endearing families seen on television. While they might be different, they might be low brow and always seem a bit jaundiced, there is at its core a family. And in today's world that's kind of rare.Single parent families abound on television. But the Simpsons have remained a two parent, three child, one dog family. And while they argue, get in trouble, yell at one another, trick parents and more, they still love one another deeper than many families seen on TV.An episode where Bart trades places with a rich look-alike results in Bart missing his family. The one where Lisa loses a crossword contest only to find her father Homer bet against her, later discovering that he spent part of the money to offer her a meaningful apology shows he really cares in his own way. And the episode where Homer and Marge remember when they were younger and almost parted ways, only to end with them kissing shows that while there life is anything but easy, they still have that love between them.Sure there are controversial moments, pokes and jabs at staid institutions and religion and more. But at the core of this show is that family identity filled with love for one another. And the jabs it takes at normal society are much less blatant than some shows. Who would have thought that one day other animated shows would be more outrageous than this one?There have been two gripes from fans about this box set. The first is that it is taken out of order with several more years (I think 6) not released yet to DVD. I think the reason might be because of the major event that this is, 20 years on TV. It's also the first time they've appeared (with the exception of their feature film) on blu-ray.The other is that this set offers almost zero extra features. Included is a clip/ad for a documentary by Morgan Spurlock about the series and menus for each disc drawn by Matt Groening. That's it. For me that's enough. I rarely have time to watch every single extra feature. But for die hard fans, their foaming at the mouth over this slight.Still, what we do get is the entire 20th season in crystal clear format ready to be watched at any time. We get one of the funniest shows ever created. And we get something that remains as topical today as it was when it began. Wouldn't it be nice if every TV show could say the same? For me this set is a great piece of entertainment for a nice price. So sit back, watch the clouds part and slowly glide into the town of Springfield as the Simpsons race home to start the show.",4,DOH!,1263254400,"01 12, 2010",2010,4593,"['1989', 'yellow', 'toned', 'family', 'appeared', 'TV', 'screens', 'little', 'seen', 'new', 'network', 'known', 'Fox', 'TV', 'Can', 'really', 'be', '20', 'years', 'first', 'got', 'glimpse', 'Simpson', 'family', 'Apparently', 'so', 'Fox', 'THE', 'SIMPSONS', 'COMPLETE', '20TH', 'SEASON.What', 'began', 'series', 'clips', 'now', 'defunct', 'TRACY', 'ULLMAN', 'SHOW', 'little', 'snippets', 'created', 'Matt', 'Groening', 'comic', 'strip', 'creator', 'who', 'drew', 'wrote', 'LIFE', 'IN', 'HELL', 'Simpson', 'family', 'kept', 'growing', 'popularity', 'antics', 'brat', 'boy', 'Bart', 'stupendously', 'idiotic', 'father', 'Homer', 'loving', 'mother', 'Marge', 'intelligent', 'sister', 'Lisa', 'silent', 'little', 'sis', 'Maggie', 'have', 'garnered', 'fans', 'world', 'So', 'much', 'THE', 'SIMPSONS', 'now', 'longest', 'running', 'prime', 'time', 'series', 'history', 'surpassing', 'even', 'M*A*S*H', 'GUNSMOKE.So', 'now', '20th', 'season', 'certainly', 'groundbreaking', 'event', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'one', 'animated', 'are', 'least', 'prior', 'series', 'few', 'prime', 'time', 'animated', 'series', 'history', 'television', 'SIMPSONS', 'opened', 'door', 'have', 'followed.So', 'what', 'season', 'have', 'offer', 'Plenty', 'are', 'still', 'adventures', 'problem', 'child', 'Bart', 'more', 'ways', 'get', 'trouble', 'fill', 'chalkboard', 'beginning', 'nearly', 'episode', 'Homer', 'still', 'stupidest', 'things', 'seen', 'TV', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'what', 'visible', 'surface.THE', 'SIMPSONS', 'always', 'taken', 'look', 'society', 'mocked', 'season', 'different', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'send', 'ups', 'society', 'look', 'take', 'Apple', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'need', 'take', 'product', 'distribute', 'Excuse', 'not', 'Apple', 'Mapple', 'Heaven', 'one', 'could', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'fun', 'here.Included', '20th', 'season', 'episode', 'Treehouse', 'Terror', 'THE', 'SIMPSONS', 'annual', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'previous', 'seasons', 'outings', 'holiday', 'Sure', 'few', 'moments', 'been', 'better.One', 'things', 'quite', 'visible', 'season', 'perhaps', 'what', 'made', 'Simpsons', 'one', 'most', 'endearing', 'families', 'seen', 'television', 'might', 'be', 'different', 'might', 'be', 'low', 'brow', 'always', 'seem', 'bit', 'jaundiced', 'core', 'family', 'today', 'world', 'kind', 'rare.Single', 'parent', 'families', 'abound', 'television', 'Simpsons', 'have', 'remained', 'two', 'parent', 'three', 'child', 'one', 'dog', 'family', 'argue', 'get', 'trouble', 'yell', 'one', 'trick', 'parents', 'more', 'still', 'love', 'one', 'deeper', 'many', 'families', 'seen', 'TV.An', 'episode', 'where', 'Bart', 'places', 'rich', 'look-alike', 'results', 'Bart', 'missing', 'family', 'one', 'where', 'Lisa', 'crossword', 'contest', 'only', 'find', 'father', 'Homer', 'bet', 'later', 'discovering', 'spent', 'part', 'money', 'offer', 'meaningful', 'apology', 'really', 'own', 'way', 'episode', 'where', 'Homer', 'Marge', 'remember', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'almost', 'parted', 'ways', 'only', 'end', 'kissing', 'shows', 'life', 'anything', 'easy', 'still', 'have', 'love', 'them.Sure', 'are', 'controversial', 'moments', 'pokes', 'jabs', 'staid', 'institutions', 'religion', 'more', 'core', 'show', 'family', 'identity', 'filled', 'love', 'one', 'jabs', 'normal', 'society', 'are', 'much', 'less', 'blatant', 'shows', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'one', 'day', 'other', 'animated', 'shows', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'outrageous', 'one', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'gripes', 'fans', 'box', 'set', 'first', 'taken', 'order', 'several', 'more', 'years', 'think', '6', 'not', 'released', 'yet', 'DVD', 'think', 'reason', 'might', 'be', 'major', 'event', '20', 'years', 'TV', 'also', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'appeared', 'exception', 'feature', 'film', 'blu-ray.The', 'other', 'set', 'almost', 'zero', 'extra', 'features', 'Included', 'clip/ad', 'documentary', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'series', 'menus', 'disc', 'drawn', 'Matt', 'Groening', 'enough', 'rarely', 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'single', 'extra', 'feature', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'foaming', 'mouth', 'slight.Still', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'entire', '20th', 'season', 'crystal', 'clear', 'format', 'ready', 'be', 'watched', 'time', 'get', 'one', 'funniest', 'ever', 'created', 'get', 'something', 'topical', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'began', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice', 'TV', 'show', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'set', 'great', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'nice', 'price', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'clouds', 'part', 'slowly', 'glide', 'town', 'Springfield', 'Simpsons', 'race', 'home', 'start', 'show']",The Simpsons: Season 20

But when a friend found out, he got it immediately.  We both figured that Season 20 would be extra extra extra packed with awesome extras - like maybe the Tracy Ullman shorts like we thought we were going to get with Season 1.  Maybe it would be extra packed with documentaries (including the one we just saw on TV a few days ago).  Maybe it would have all of the news clips throughout the years showing the slow acceptance of society (they went from BAD for the family to a Great example of a good family).  Maybe it would have lots of behind the scenes footage of some of the stars over the years?  Maybe...Then our dreams were shattered.  We opened the package and put it in the DVD player.  First, it has the same awful disc-scratching packaging as seasons 11 and 12.  Second, it had ZERO (1-12 had lots) extras.

Mular,"[2, 2]","First let me say that this season gets **** or more for quality, the show managed to get better after some very weak provious seasons.And yes, I watched the original broadcasts of these shows in HD to know that the first 9 episodes were produced in SD & upconverted to 720p for FOX to broadcast (FOX broadcasts HD in 720p, not 1080i).  I have no complaints about this, that is the way it was.  One question would be about the remaining 12 HD episodes. Since FOX transits in 720p, were they produced in that format & upconverted for this Blu-ray release, or did FOX downconvert from 1080p to 720p for their transmission?To take a historically important 20th season, few shows make it to 20 seasons let alone an animated series, and give the release NOTHING special is a kick in the butt to both The Simpsons & their fans.NO documentary about converting the 20th season to HD & the changes the producers had to make.NO documentary about how the characters have evoled over the years.NO commentaries to add insight into the episodes we have already seen.NO more clips from The Tracy Ulman Show to help show the evolution.NO special limited 20th season packaging.  Hey they could have put this in a limited edition Simpsons Couch, then sold the Simpsons figures seperately for us to buy & put on the couch.

The entertainment and quality of the show for the past seven years or so have shown a clear deterioration of the show and the cast who while still put their best zing into their character roles have just seem to have lost the magic that made us fans when the show first became a FOX megastar back in 1989,  I'm sure many of us remember when the first early years of the show we would be entranced and feverishly trying to make sure we saw the next episode the following week,  now I like I'm sure many others can't even be bothered to care about what's happening or when the show comes on anymore.

There have been some complaints about the decline of the show ever since the beginning the 00`s. It`s hard to pick a season where the decline really began but it is true that the show is not as good as it was I`ll admit it, but I think it`s still good and I still enjoy it.

But I really liked a few episodes like ""Eeny Teeny Maya Moe"" in which Moe has a new romance, ""No Loan Again, Naturally"" was great with Ned Flanders helping the Simpsons trough difficult time as they reached bankruptcy and this season`s ""Treehouse of Horror XIX"" was very good and the allusion to Charlie Brown was brilliant. The worst episode of this season is perhaps the worst in the show`s history ""Four Great Women and a Manicure"" , another Simpsons twist on history but this one proves to be the worst yet. The season was mostly good.You will notice a change in the visual style of the show, it is pretty much the same but somehow it's different. It features more technology which turns out to be very funny and the visual style has changed a little it's like the show has gotten a facelift, and I don't think it hurt after so many years you're bound to change at some point. You will also notice the new title sequence for the show, I like it but I miss Homer's scream from the original! The Simpsons are now in HD and it looks very good.I`d like to think that the box of this season will be different than season 11 and 12`s accordion style but no one really knows now.  They should really consider doing something else or return to the older boxes format I never hear anyone complain about those. I know how they want to do an eco-friendly packaging but it`s obviously not a hit with most fans, it didn`t look so good and I didn`t like how it scratched my discs and I`m sure I wasn`t the only one.Season 20 is not bad really but it just doesn't compare well to the earlier seasons. I don't laugh as I much as I used to while watching the show but I still find it entertaining and worth watching. There were some very good episodes and this season was better than a few of the previous ones. I don't know why they are releasing this one ahead of the others (13-19), yes it's the 20th anniversary but still this will make some fans angry. I'll give season 20 three stars it was a good season. So will I be buying? Well yes because it's still better than no Simpsons in my opinion and if you don't like the show at this point then don't bother with it that's all.",3,"""Not A Bad Season""",1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,3013,"['Simpsons', 'have', 'been', 'more', '20', 'years', 'now', 's', 'safe', 'say', 'ever', 'surfed', 'television', 'came', 'paved', 'way', 'other', 'animated', 'comedy', 'shows', 'genre', 'more', '400', 'episodes', 'credit', 'won', 'few', 'awards', 's', 'been', 'air', 'seemingly', 'forever', 'there', 's', 'plenty', 'more', 'say', 'have', 'been', 'complaints', 'decline', 'show', 'ever', 'beginning', '00', 's', 's', 'hard', 'pick', 'season', 'where', 'decline', 'really', 'began', 'true', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'll', 'admit', 'think', 's', 'still', 'good', 'still', 'enjoy', 'time', 'season', 'few', 'great', 'episodes', 'mixed', 'few', 'good', 'ones', 'not-so-good', 'one', 'season', '20', 'different.Now', 'won', 't', 'be', 'doing', 'episode', 'list', 'other', 'reviewers', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'really', 'liked', 'few', 'episodes', 'Eeny', 'Teeny', 'Maya', 'Moe', 'Moe', 'new', 'romance', 'Loan', 'Again', 'Naturally', 'was', 'great', 'Ned', 'Flanders', 'helping', 'Simpsons', 'difficult', 'time', 'reached', 'bankruptcy', 'season', 's', 'Treehouse', 'Horror', 'XIX', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'allusion', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'was', 'brilliant', 'worst', 'episode', 'season', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'show', 's', 'history', 'Four', 'Great', 'Women', 'Manicure', 'Simpsons', 'twist', 'history', 'one', 'be', 'worst', 'yet', 'season', 'was', 'mostly', 'good.You', 'will', 'notice', 'change', 'visual', 'style', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'somehow', 'different', 'more', 'technology', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'visual', 'style', 'changed', 'little', 'show', 'gotten', 'facelift', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'many', 'years', ""'re"", 'bound', 'change', 'point', 'will', 'also', 'notice', 'new', 'title', 'sequence', 'show', 'like', 'miss', 'Homer', 'scream', 'original', 'Simpsons', 'are', 'now', 'HD', 'very', 'good.I', 'd', 'think', 'box', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'season', '11', '12', 's', 'accordion', 'style', 'one', 'really', 'now', 'should', 'really', 'consider', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'return', 'older', 'boxes', 'format', 'never', 'hear', 'anyone', 'complain', 'know', 'how', 'want', 'do', 'eco-friendly', 'packaging', 's', 'obviously', 'not', 'hit', 'most', 'fans', 't', 'look', 'so', 'good', 'didn', 't', 'how', 'scratched', 'discs', 'm', 'sure', 'wasn', 't', 'only', 'one.Season', '20', 'not', 'bad', 'really', 'just', ""n't"", 'compare', 'well', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'much', 'used', 'watching', 'show', 'still', 'find', 'entertaining', 'worth', 'watching', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', 'season', 'was', 'better', 'few', 'previous', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'are', 'releasing', 'one', 'ahead', 'others', '13-19', 'yes', '20th', 'anniversary', 'still', 'will', 'make', 'fans', 'angry', ""'ll"", 'give', 'season', '20', 'three', 'stars', 'was', 'good', 'season', 'So', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'Well', 'yes', 'still', 'better', 'Simpsons', 'opinion', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', 'point', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother']",The Simpsons: Season 20

It contains no special features, has the same terrible disc-scratching packaging as the past couple of dvd seasons and is notably missing the traditional introduction from Matt Groening.That being said, I am rating the episodes in this review and am giving this product a 5/5 solely for the quality of the shows (not the container in which they came). This dvd set is worth purchasing just for the episodes. While not every one is an instant classic, as when the Simpsons was in its prime, there are some great ones (""How the Test Was Won"" for example). There are also no bad episodes and each one contains many genuinely funny moments. The Simpsons has managed to remain a very good show for over 20 years. In its 450+ episodes, none contain a single embarrassingly unfunny joke (as we often have seen in the last few seasons of Family Guy). Moreover, this is the season where the show began to be broadcast in HD and started to be animated in a widescreen format.

Here are my thoughts and feelings on this subject as a cheated consumer:Commentaries on the Simpsons/Futurama have always been extremely amusing.  I'd have rather patiently waited for them to be recorded so that they could be included.Deleted scenes are always great, but why omit them when they obviously haven't been lost to the passage of time?Seasons 6 through 10 were in shoddy ""hollowed out human heads"" while 11 and 12 were similarly packaged--but never mind that:  Season 11 was packaged in a sandpaper-like cardboard accordian, which scratched the disks BEFORE I even pulled them out; Season 12 was the same but glossy to prevent scratching, but I still couldn't get the damn disks out without getting fingerprints all over them (as I had to PRY them out of the glossy sleeves).  Needless to say, I have NEVER put the disks back into the original boxes; they're in plastic cases wasting EVEN MORE space since I haven't let myself throw the original boxes away.And now season 20 is packed in the same imbecilic implementation.FIX THE BLOODY PACKAGING ALREADY, FOX!",1,I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT PURCHASE THIS DEFICIENT PRODUCT!!!!!!,1264550400,"01 27, 2010",2010,1413,"['immediately', 'bought', 'first', '12', 'seasons', 'release', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'DID', 'NOT', 'buy', 'one.This', 'defecatory', 'piece', 'refuse', 'essentially', 'ZERO', 'special', 'features', 'sneak', 'preview', 'show', 'aired', '2', 'days', 'DVD', 'release', 'not', 'special', 'feature', 'horrible', 'packaging', 'AGAIN', 'guaranteed', 'destroy', 'disks', 'Here', 'are', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'subject', 'cheated', 'consumer', 'Commentaries', 'Simpsons/Futurama', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'extremely', 'amusing', ""'d"", 'have', 'rather', 'patiently', 'waited', 'be', 'recorded', 'so', 'could', 'be', 'included.Deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'always', 'great', 'why', 'omit', 'when', 'obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'lost', 'passage', 'time', 'Seasons', '6', '10', 'were', 'shoddy', 'hollowed', 'out', 'human', 'heads', '11', '12', 'were', 'similarly', 'packaged', 'never', 'mind', 'Season', '11', 'was', 'packaged', 'sandpaper-like', 'cardboard', 'accordian', 'scratched', 'disks', 'even', 'pulled', 'out', 'Season', '12', 'was', 'same', 'glossy', 'prevent', 'scratching', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'damn', 'out', 'getting', 'fingerprints', 'had', 'PRY', 'glossy', 'sleeves', 'Needless', 'say', 'have', 'NEVER', 'put', 'disks', 'back', 'original', 'boxes', ""'re"", 'plastic', 'cases', 'wasting', 'EVEN', 'MORE', 'space', 'have', ""n't"", 'let', 'throw', 'original', 'boxes', 'away.And', 'now', 'season', '20', 'packed', 'same', 'imbecilic', 'implementation.FIX', 'THE', 'BLOODY', 'PACKAGING', 'ALREADY', 'FOX']",The Simpsons: Season 20
1212803,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B001L1S1PI,Westley,"[1, 2]","As fans of ""The Simpsons"" know, the producers have been releasing excellent DVD sets of the show's initial seasons, with the first 12 seasons now available.  To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the show, they jumped ahead in the sequence and released this 20th season set.  Not a bad idea.  However, as other reviewers have noted, this set seems hastily put together and includes no commentaries, deleted scenes, or other typical extras.  As a fan of the show, I always watch the episode and then the corresponding commentary track, which are invariably funny and informative.  This set seems like a rip-off, and I suspect that, when they get to season 20 in the sequence of DVD sets, they will redo the package, meaning that I will probably be purchasing a similar set in a few years.So how are the episodes?  Well, for the 20th season of a show, the episodes are quite good, with some excellent episodes and just a few clunkers (I'd argue that the episodes are better overall than at least one of the prior DVD sets - Season 11).  ""Coming to Homerica"" is a very clever examination of the hysteria during the 2008 election over the issue of immigration.  In this case, Norwegians from nearby Ogdenville flood into Springfield, creating xenophobia and resulting in the building of a giant wall around the town.  I'm not always a fan of the Halloween episodes, but ""Treehouse of Horror XIX"" is quite good, especially the play on Peanut's The Great Pumpkin.  Finally, ""Mypods and Broomsticks"" does a nice job skewing Apple and iPods.  Season after season, ""The Simpsons"" manages to remain relevant through their timely and witty satirizing abilities, and Season 20 is solid in this regard.On the other hand, the set contains two of the worst episodes in recent memory.  ""Gone Maggie Gone"" is a lame parody of ""The Da Vinci Code"" that makes little sense and has few laughs.  Worse yet is the scattershot ""Four Great Women and a Manicure,"" in which Marge and Lisa for some reason trade stories about women.  This episode had very little connective thread and left me puzzled.  Deservedly, it was the lowest rated episode in Simpson's history.I consider myself to be a fairly hardcore fan of the series, although I am not always able to watch the show every week.  So I also welcome the DVD sets, and I enjoyed watching the episodes from season 20.  The season was a relatively good one, worthy of 4 stars.  However, I have to dock the DVD set at least one star for lacking the typical extras and care with which the show is usually packaged.",3,Out of order,1264550400,"01 27, 2010",2010,2538,"['fans', 'Simpsons', 'know', 'producers', 'have', 'been', 'releasing', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'sets', 'show', 'initial', 'seasons', 'first', '12', 'seasons', 'now', 'available', 'celebrate', '20th', 'anniversary', 'show', 'jumped', 'ahead', 'sequence', 'released', '20th', 'season', 'set', 'Not', 'bad', 'idea', 'However', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'set', 'hastily', 'put', 'together', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'other', 'typical', 'extras', 'fan', 'show', 'always', 'watch', 'episode', 'then', 'corresponding', 'commentary', 'track', 'are', 'invariably', 'funny', 'informative', 'set', 'rip-off', 'suspect', 'when', 'get', 'season', '20', 'sequence', 'DVD', 'sets', 'will', 'redo', 'package', 'meaning', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'purchasing', 'similar', 'set', 'few', 'years.So', 'how', 'are', 'episodes', 'Well', '20th', 'season', 'show', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'just', 'few', 'clunkers', ""'d"", 'argue', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', 'overall', 'least', 'one', 'prior', 'DVD', 'sets', 'Season', '11', 'Coming', 'Homerica', 'very', 'clever', 'examination', 'hysteria', '2008', 'election', 'issue', 'immigration', 'case', 'Norwegians', 'nearby', 'Ogdenville', 'flood', 'Springfield', 'creating', 'xenophobia', 'resulting', 'building', 'giant', 'wall', 'town', ""'m"", 'not', 'always', 'fan', 'Halloween', 'episodes', 'Treehouse', 'Horror', 'XIX', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'play', 'Peanut', 'Great', 'Pumpkin', 'Finally', 'Mypods', 'Broomsticks', 'nice', 'job', 'skewing', 'Apple', 'iPods', 'Season', 'season', 'Simpsons', 'remain', 'relevant', 'timely', 'witty', 'satirizing', 'abilities', 'Season', '20', 'solid', 'regard.On', 'other', 'hand', 'set', 'two', 'worst', 'episodes', 'recent', 'memory', 'Gone', 'Maggie', 'Gone', 'lame', 'parody', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'little', 'sense', 'few', 'laughs', 'Worse', 'yet', 'scattershot', 'Four', 'Great', 'Women', 'Manicure', 'Marge', 'Lisa', 'reason', 'trade', 'stories', 'women', 'episode', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'connective', 'thread', 'left', 'puzzled', 'Deservedly', 'was', 'lowest', 'rated', 'episode', 'Simpson', 'history.I', 'consider', 'be', 'fairly', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'series', 'am', 'not', 'always', 'able', 'watch', 'show', 'week', 'also', 'welcome', 'DVD', 'sets', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'episodes', 'season', '20', 'season', 'was', 'relatively', 'good', 'one', 'worthy', '4', 'stars', 'However', 'have', 'dock', 'DVD', 'set', 'least', 'one', 'star', 'lacking', 'typical', 'extras', 'care', 'show', 'usually', 'packaged']",The Simpsons: Season 20
