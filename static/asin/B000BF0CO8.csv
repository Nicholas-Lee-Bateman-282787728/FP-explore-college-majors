941386,A111TATNFNSU3X,B000BF0CO8,Knight Poet,"[2, 3]","No book, either the Bible or even The Urantia Book that I am a student of, can ever take the place of one's personal experiences involving the spiritual reality of God. This same concept applies to movies as well. So my faith in God was not altered one way or the other when a little over a minute into this episode about Prophets, they show (for three to four seconds) the back side of a naked man walking down a dirt road as the narrator tells us about Isaiah walking naked through the streets of Jerusalem for three years. But my faith in the producers of this show headed in a negative direction from this point on (that is to say that I tuned out even though I tried to watch the rest and listen with an open mind). It's not that I am particularly offended by nudity since from what I've been told, that's what I was wearing when I came into this world...absolutely nothing. And if the show was about how to join a Mesopotamian nudist colony or how to get an even suntan all over or perhaps even how to get arrested before you even have a chance to get an even suntan all over, then I would not have been so surprised by what seems to me to have been a poor choice of visual imagery considering the subject matter. But I did assume that a documentary produced by A & E TV about the Mysteries of the Bible would be a family-friendly production suitable for all ages of viewers especially when it is rated TV-G. Apparently, my assumption was invalid. Perhaps Coppertone was one of their sponsors when this first aired on March 17, 1995.",1,The Naked Truth,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,1539,"['book', 'Bible', 'even', 'Urantia', 'Book', 'am', 'student', 'can', 'ever', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'personal', 'experiences', 'involving', 'spiritual', 'reality', 'God', 'same', 'concept', 'applies', 'movies', 'well', 'faith', 'God', 'was', 'not', 'altered', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'when', 'little', 'over', 'minute', 'episode', 'Prophets', 'show', 'three', 'four', 'seconds', 'back', 'side', 'naked', 'man', 'walking', 'down', 'dirt', 'road', 'narrator', 'Isaiah', 'walking', 'naked', 'streets', 'Jerusalem', 'three', 'years', 'faith', 'producers', 'show', 'headed', 'negative', 'direction', 'point', 'say', 'tuned', 'out', 'even', 'tried', 'watch', 'rest', 'listen', 'open', 'mind', 'not', 'am', 'particularly', 'offended', 'nudity', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'what', 'was', 'wearing', 'when', 'came', 'world', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'show', 'was', 'how', 'join', 'Mesopotamian', 'nudist', 'colony', 'how', 'get', 'even', 'suntan', 'perhaps', 'even', 'how', 'get', 'arrested', 'even', 'have', 'chance', 'get', 'even', 'suntan', 'over', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'surprised', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'poor', 'choice', 'visual', 'imagery', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'did', 'assume', 'documentary', 'produced', 'A', 'E', 'TV', 'Mysteries', 'Bible', 'would', 'be', 'family-friendly', 'production', 'suitable', 'ages', 'viewers', 'especially', 'when', 'rated', 'TV-G', 'Apparently', 'assumption', 'was', 'invalid', 'Perhaps', 'Coppertone', 'was', 'one', 'sponsors', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'March', '17', '1995']",Mysteries of the Bible - Prophets
941387,A3410YP65KJQ3M,B000BF0CO8,"Mark ""mdippy""","[2, 2]","I bought this title in expectation of some explanations of the ancient Bible prophecies. Nowhere in this collection are there any mention of Daniel's prophecies concerning the 70 weeks or any attempted explanations of Ezekiels 430 days. While there are different attitudes and interpretations concerning these visions, i would think they would deserve being highlighted as one of the reasons these prophets were called prophets. Prophets working themselves into a frenzy, cannot be proven. A rather unflattering impression. Isaiah walked around naked for 3 years. Okay, that's a Bible fact.But what about all of his prophecies concerning the coming Messiah, that proved accurate? Oh well. As i said earlier, you can buy it for the enterainment value, but don't be misled or taken into someone elses opinion.",3,"Entertaining, but is it factual?",1256342400,"10 24, 2009",2009,807,"['bought', 'title', 'expectation', 'explanations', 'ancient', 'Bible', 'prophecies', 'Nowhere', 'collection', 'are', 'there', 'mention', 'Daniel', 'prophecies', 'concerning', '70', 'weeks', 'attempted', 'explanations', 'Ezekiels', '430', 'days', 'are', 'different', 'attitudes', 'interpretations', 'concerning', 'visions', 'i', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'deserve', 'being', 'highlighted', 'one', 'reasons', 'prophets', 'were', 'called', 'prophets', 'Prophets', 'working', 'frenzy', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'proven', 'rather', 'unflattering', 'impression', 'Isaiah', 'walked', 'around', 'naked', '3', 'years', 'Okay', 'Bible', 'fact.But', 'what', 'prophecies', 'concerning', 'coming', 'Messiah', 'proved', 'accurate', 'Oh', 'well', 'i', 'said', 'earlier', 'can', 'buy', 'enterainment', 'value', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'misled', 'taken', 'someone', 'opinion']",Mysteries of the Bible - Prophets
941388,A3D76ATDOKOMKT,B000BF0CO8,"Trish ""Lorica Lady""","[9, 9]","Well, after all this video was produced by Arts and....Entertainment.And after all, it is designed for mass consumption.  It is about what onewould expect.  Some truths.  Some extra Biblical speculation presentedas fact, and some flat out misleading information.For example: One prophet ispictured literally eating a scroll here on earth, when in reality the experiencewas part of a visionary, Heavenly experirence.  One ""Professor of Old TestamentHistory"", apparently because Saul met some praise singers and dancers beforea spirit of prophecy came on him, and because one prophet asked for harpmusic before making a Divine proclamation, states that the prophets""worked themselves into frenzies"" before they heard from YHWH and suggestedthat they became like ""whirling dervishes.""  Sad. So much for the ""stillsmall voice"" of the Father that the prophets actually, generally, heard.In another place in the video an opinion is presented that the visionof the fiery chariot might be a UFO, and of coures no attempt is madeto explain that this would be based on nothing in Scriptures.Nevertheless the video gives an interesting panormaic view of prophecywhich can lead to some valuable reflection.  The problem is, if youaren't very familiar with Scriptures, you could be very deceived by theinaccuracies presented side by side with the truth.",3,Let the viewer beware...and check the Word for yourself.,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,1340,"['Well', 'video', 'was', 'produced', 'Arts', '.Entertainment.And', 'designed', 'mass', 'consumption', 'what', 'onewould', 'expect', 'truths', 'extra', 'Biblical', 'speculation', 'presentedas', 'fact', 'flat', 'out', 'misleading', 'information.For', 'example', 'One', 'prophet', 'ispictured', 'literally', 'eating', 'scroll', 'here', 'earth', 'when', 'reality', 'experiencewas', 'part', 'visionary', 'Heavenly', 'experirence', 'One', 'Professor', 'Old', 'TestamentHistory', 'apparently', 'Saul', 'met', 'praise', 'singers', 'dancers', 'beforea', 'spirit', 'prophecy', 'came', 'one', 'prophet', 'asked', 'harpmusic', 'making', 'Divine', 'proclamation', 'prophets', 'worked', 'frenzies', 'heard', 'YHWH', 'suggestedthat', 'became', 'whirling', 'dervishes', 'Sad', 'So', 'much', 'stillsmall', 'voice', 'Father', 'prophets', 'actually', 'generally', 'place', 'video', 'opinion', 'presented', 'visionof', 'fiery', 'chariot', 'might', 'be', 'UFO', 'coures', 'attempt', 'madeto', 'explain', 'would', 'be', 'based', 'nothing', 'Scriptures.Nevertheless', 'video', 'interesting', 'panormaic', 'view', 'prophecywhich', 'can', 'lead', 'valuable', 'reflection', 'problem', 'youare', ""n't"", 'very', 'familiar', 'Scriptures', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'deceived', 'theinaccuracies', 'presented', 'side', 'side', 'truth']",Mysteries of the Bible - Prophets
