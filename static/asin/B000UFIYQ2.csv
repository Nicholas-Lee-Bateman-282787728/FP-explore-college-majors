1094956,A3UUF0T87UNS9R,B000UFIYQ2,argytunes,"[3, 3]","When the price finally went down on this set, I decided to buy it.  My original 3 VHS Tapes are buried in a storage bin so it was time for a DVD upgrade.  It's a shame that most of Johnny's earlier years weren't saved, but all of the DVDs in this collection have some wonderful stars and terrific jokes.  There can never be enough Mighty Carson Art Players, Carnac, or Johnny's adventures with animals!  Jim Fowler and Joan Embry are perfect foils for Carson's sense of humor. All of these segments are paced very well with the TONIGHT SHOW guests.There are 2 drawbacks.  Not enough music from Doc and The Band...along with the fact that a lot of the same stuff gets recycled over and over.  It seems to me that some of the DVDs were padded...and even then, the running time for the segments bottomed out at 47 minutes.Ironically...the weakest collection is the 2-Disc Comedian Set.  Most of the material is either topic sensitive or just isn't funny.  I spent one morning watching Disc #1. Jerry Seinfeld, Garry Shandling and a few others tried to be hilarious...but they weren't!  Carson was laughing in the background and I kept saying to myself: ""This is not really FUNNY!""  What surprised me was the fact that some of the lesser known comedians....who made only 1 or 2 TONIGHT SHOW appearances....made a better impression.  Also...Roseanne Barr was really funny.  [There's a separate segment on another DVD pitting David Letterman and Joe Piscopo together which is hilarious].What made me appreciate this set was the fact that I've just finished Henry Bushkin's ""JOHNNY CARSON book.  Bushkin was Johnny's Legal Representative and close friend for roughly 20 years.  Johnny occasionally referenced him (""Bombastic Bushkin"") in some of his monologues.  There was definitely a public and private side to Johnny which I tried to decipher while watching this set.To sum it up...""Heeere's Johnny"" is a good retrospective when it comes to 3 decades of late night entertainment.  Carson set a high bar which few of his successors have been able to match.  For those of us who appreciate and still miss Johnny...try and ignore the repetition.  Take the set for what it is...a piece of comedic history performed by a genius who could coax a laugh out of practically anybody!",4,For Those Who Miss Johnny Carson----can you handle the repetition?,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,2269,"['When', 'price', 'finally', 'went', 'down', 'set', 'decided', 'buy', 'My', 'original', '3', 'VHS', 'Tapes', 'are', 'buried', 'storage', 'bin', 'was', 'time', 'DVD', 'upgrade', 'shame', 'most', 'Johnny', 'earlier', 'years', 'were', ""n't"", 'saved', 'DVDs', 'collection', 'have', 'wonderful', 'stars', 'terrific', 'jokes', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'enough', 'Mighty', 'Carson', 'Art', 'Players', 'Carnac', 'Johnny', 'adventures', 'animals', 'Jim', 'Fowler', 'Joan', 'Embry', 'are', 'perfect', 'foils', 'Carson', 'sense', 'humor', 'segments', 'are', 'paced', 'very', 'well', 'TONIGHT', 'SHOW', 'are', '2', 'drawbacks', 'Not', 'enough', 'music', 'Doc', 'Band', 'fact', 'lot', 'same', 'stuff', 'recycled', 'DVDs', 'were', 'padded', 'even', 'then', 'running', 'time', 'segments', 'bottomed', 'out', '47', 'minutes.Ironically', 'weakest', 'collection', '2-Disc', 'Comedian', 'Set', 'Most', 'material', 'topic', 'sensitive', 'just', ""n't"", 'funny', 'spent', 'one', 'morning', 'watching', 'Disc', '1', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'few', 'others', 'tried', 'be', 'hilarious', 'were', ""n't"", 'Carson', 'was', 'laughing', 'background', 'kept', 'saying', 'myself', 'not', 'really', 'FUNNY', 'What', 'surprised', 'was', 'fact', 'lesser', 'known', 'comedians', '.who', 'made', 'only', '1', '2', 'TONIGHT', 'SHOW', 'appearances', '.made', 'better', 'impression', 'Also', 'Roseanne', 'Barr', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'separate', 'segment', 'DVD', 'pitting', 'David', 'Letterman', 'Joe', 'Piscopo', 'together', 'hilarious', ']', '.What', 'made', 'appreciate', 'set', 'was', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'just', 'finished', 'Henry', 'Bushkin', 'JOHNNY', 'CARSON', 'book', 'Bushkin', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Legal', 'Representative', 'close', 'friend', 'roughly', '20', 'years', 'Johnny', 'occasionally', 'referenced', 'Bombastic', 'Bushkin', 'monologues', 'was', 'definitely', 'public', 'private', 'side', 'Johnny', 'tried', 'decipher', 'watching', 'set.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Heeere', 'Johnny', 'good', 'retrospective', 'when', '3', 'decades', 'late', 'night', 'entertainment', 'Carson', 'set', 'high', 'bar', 'few', 'successors', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'match', 'who', 'appreciate', 'still', 'miss', 'Johnny', 'try', 'ignore', 'repetition', 'Take', 'set', 'what', 'piece', 'comedic', 'history', 'performed', 'genius', 'who', 'could', 'coax', 'laugh', 'practically', 'anybody']",Heeere's Johnny - The Definitive from The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson

Hardin ""Zoned in space""","[12, 12]","It really is cool to have virtually everything ever released on DVD by Carson's Tonight Show all in one package...but, it would have been even nicer to include another large collection of as-yet-unreleased material. This box is a compilation of Carson Country, Animal Hijinks, the 3 DVD Ultimate Carson set, Stand Up Comedians and the Timeless Moments collection that was previously available to the Carson club members (some of these Timeless Moments can all be found in the recent release The Best Of Carson Volume 1).I can also confirm that the 3 DVD Ultimate Carson set has been edited from it's original release, because I own the original release and was able to see what was cut out, most notably the montage of music stars that appeared on The Tonight Show over the 30 years from the very last show on May 22, 1992. For those of us who abhor things like that, the loss of that montage is a major disappointment! I have a feeling that it was cut out for some kind of music licensing reasons...but if it was put in the original, come on!!For those of you who have never bought any of the other releases, this box set is the bomb-diggity...go for it!But Respond2 or some other DVD releasing production company (Carson Productions perhaps?) needs to get extremely busy and release more of the gems from the more than 2500 available shows that are sitting on shelves out there somewhere (I'm not counting the 1500 shows from the 60's that are permanently lost).

I was able to pre-order the set for $69.99 and I received it just one day after the official release date.  My wife and I have been slowly working our way through the collection, one DVD at a time.  Johnny is an icon and legend of late night television.  This collection does a great job of spanning much of Johnny's years of being the Tonight Show host.  However, the picture and sound quality is sometime quite bad.  The overall picture quality is average at best.  I would have thought that the old video would have gone through some sort of restoration process.  Obviously this isn't the case in this collection.  There are some scenes that flicker and have lines running through them, and the sound sometimes becomes garbled.  Another dissapointment is that this collection has no specific order.  There is no way to easily work your way from oldest to newest, or in any other manner.  This collection is actually made up of several other collections.  One of the included collections is made entirely of stand-up commedian guests that appeared on The Tonight Show.  I bought this to watch Johnny, not to see a young Jerry Seinfeld, or the early (and yet still irritating) years of Rosanne Baar.Overall this is an excellent collection of Johnny Carson's golden years in television.  I just wish it was better organized, had more clips of Johnny himself, and wish the video and audio had gone through some sort of restoration process.  For the money this is definately a good buy, if you are a die hard Carson fan.  =o)",4,A Great Collection of Classic Carson Comedy,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,1607,"['was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'Heeere', 'Johnny', 'DVD', 'collection', 'released', 'Amazon.com', 'was', 'able', 'pre-order', 'set', '69.99', 'received', 'just', 'one', 'day', 'official', 'release', 'date', 'wife', 'have', 'been', 'slowly', 'working', 'way', 'collection', 'one', 'DVD', 'time', 'Johnny', 'icon', 'legend', 'late', 'night', 'television', 'collection', 'great', 'job', 'spanning', 'much', 'Johnny', 'years', 'being', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'host', 'However', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'sometime', 'quite', 'bad', 'overall', 'picture', 'quality', 'average', 'best', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'old', 'video', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'sort', 'restoration', 'process', 'Obviously', ""n't"", 'case', 'collection', 'are', 'scenes', 'flicker', 'have', 'lines', 'running', 'sound', 'sometimes', 'becomes', 'garbled', 'dissapointment', 'collection', 'specific', 'order', 'way', 'easily', 'work', 'way', 'oldest', 'newest', 'other', 'manner', 'collection', 'actually', 'made', 'several', 'other', 'collections', 'One', 'included', 'collections', 'made', 'entirely', 'stand-up', 'commedian', 'guests', 'appeared', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'bought', 'watch', 'Johnny', 'not', 'see', 'young', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'early', 'yet', 'still', 'irritating', 'years', 'Rosanne', 'Baar.Overall', 'excellent', 'collection', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'golden', 'years', 'television', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'better', 'organized', 'had', 'more', 'clips', 'Johnny', 'wish', 'video', 'audio', 'had', 'gone', 'sort', 'restoration', 'process', 'money', 'definately', 'good', 'buy', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'Carson', 'fan', '=o']",Heeere's Johnny - The Definitive from The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson

Just a mere smattering of the performers, skits, music and desk side chatter from the world's ultimate next day's water cooler show. I cannot believe it!Please issue DVDs of selected full shows. I remember that so many shows were great not because of any single performer but because of the entirety of the whole program, from monologue to conclusion.I recently purchased the big box set and it's really nice to have these performances of this comedian or that country star. Or some of the memories and the heart breaking last two shows. I gave it 5 stars just for the emotional aspects, the nostaligic reasons, to be able to once again catch a few glimpses of the finest talk and entertainment show this nation's ever had. I owe Johnny that.But really what's really missing are the banter between Johnny and his many personal close friends and fellow performers, the interviews, Johnny just being Johnny letting others have their time in the spot light but always adding his quips and charming laughter, his suave cosmopolitan presence anchoring the whole thing.In all these DVDs there's really precious little of Johnny himself!We fans, fans of all ages, would greatly appreciate having DVDs of many selected full shows. Especially at its peak during the late '60s through the '70s when so many of the classic stars, now long gone (Bob Hope, Dean Martin, etc) AND the up and coming newer stars who are still around today were all mingling together on the hour and a half shows.Whole DVDs could be devoted to the appearances of specific guests like Jimmy Stewart, Bob Hope, and so many others.Not only were there an awful lot of incredibly funny stuff back then. But I easily recall, especially on the shows before it went down to just one hour, the great conversations he had with so many people!After what for many of us was the better portion of our TV lives spent watching The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson to only have the little that's been doled out is, in many ways, very sad. That show provided so much in the way of coloring our culture and it and we deserve more that the nice, but very stingy, teasers from all those years, really the best years of American culture at its peak.Please, please consider doing so much more than just what's been done.Thank you, from millions, a whole nation, of Johnny Carson & The Tonight Show fans.",5,Johnny Carson Gave America 30 Years Of The Greatest Talk & Entertainment Show Ever!,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,2375,"['what', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'Just', 'mere', 'smattering', 'performers', 'skits', 'music', 'desk', 'side', 'chatter', 'world', 'ultimate', 'next', 'day', 'water', 'cooler', 'show', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'Please', 'issue', 'DVDs', 'selected', 'full', 'shows', 'remember', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'were', 'great', 'not', 'single', 'performer', 'entirety', 'whole', 'program', 'monologue', 'conclusion.I', 'recently', 'purchased', 'big', 'box', 'set', 'really', 'nice', 'have', 'performances', 'comedian', 'country', 'star', 'memories', 'heart', 'breaking', 'last', 'two', 'shows', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'just', 'emotional', 'aspects', 'nostaligic', 'reasons', 'be', 'able', 'once', 'again', 'catch', 'few', 'glimpses', 'finest', 'talk', 'entertainment', 'show', 'nation', 'ever', 'had', 'owe', 'Johnny', 'that.But', 'really', 'what', 'really', 'missing', 'are', 'banter', 'Johnny', 'many', 'personal', 'close', 'friends', 'fellow', 'performers', 'interviews', 'Johnny', 'just', 'being', 'Johnny', 'letting', 'others', 'have', 'time', 'spot', 'light', 'always', 'adding', 'quips', 'charming', 'laughter', 'suave', 'cosmopolitan', 'presence', 'anchoring', 'whole', 'thing.In', 'DVDs', 'really', 'precious', 'little', 'Johnny', 'fans', 'fans', 'ages', 'would', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'having', 'DVDs', 'many', 'selected', 'full', 'shows', 'Especially', 'peak', 'late', ""'60s"", ""'70s"", 'when', 'so', 'many', 'classic', 'stars', 'now', 'long', 'gone', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'etc', 'up', 'coming', 'newer', 'stars', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'today', 'were', 'mingling', 'together', 'hour', 'half', 'shows.Whole', 'DVDs', 'could', 'be', 'devoted', 'appearances', 'specific', 'guests', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'so', 'many', 'others.Not', 'only', 'were', 'awful', 'lot', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'stuff', 'back', 'then', 'easily', 'recall', 'especially', 'shows', 'went', 'down', 'just', 'one', 'hour', 'great', 'conversations', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'what', 'many', 'was', 'better', 'portion', 'TV', 'spent', 'watching', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'only', 'have', 'little', 'been', 'doled', 'out', 'many', 'ways', 'very', 'sad', 'show', 'provided', 'so', 'much', 'way', 'coloring', 'culture', 'deserve', 'more', 'nice', 'very', 'stingy', 'teasers', 'years', 'really', 'best', 'years', 'American', 'culture', 'peak.Please', 'please', 'consider', 'doing', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'what', 'been', 'done.Thank', 'millions', 'whole', 'nation', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'fans']",Heeere's Johnny - The Definitive from The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson
