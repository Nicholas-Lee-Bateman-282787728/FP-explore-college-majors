Tried the DVD on a lark-- and man, what a wonderfully entertaining lark it is.An excellent cast of talented and enjoyable actors; seamless CGI effects; a clever script that allows the Roman legions to declare war on American cowboys, and Sacagawea to tend to the wounds of a lovestruck Teddy Roosevelt... what more could you want from an entertainment?Here's what more: ""A Night At the Museum"" is not just entertaining. It's also affectionate toward all of its characters. So many PG movies these days are undercut by some hostile but banal ""PC messages""-- like ""Pocahontas"" with its anti-white nonsense, or ""Happy Feet"" with its tedious ecological guilt trips...

Four stars though I feel is due, especially since this film far exceeded my expectations.  I'm a big Ben Stiller fan but I must admit I was not thrilled about seeing this film, not in the least, but my wife insisted we rent it and so we did, and I was floored at how much a truly enjoyed it.  The film is smart, funny and those special effects are outstandingly good.  The T-Rex alone is so realistic it's unbelievable.The film follows unreliable dad Larry as he tries to make his life a little more stable for his son Nick.  His constant switching of work and residence is making it difficult for him to have a relationship with his son.  That all changes though when he gets a job as the night security guard at the Museum of Natural History.  The idea fascinates his son (what kid wouldn't want a parent working at a place like that) and this makes Larry happy.  That is of course until his first night alone in the building when he uncovers something amazing, and a bit scary.  Everything, and I mean everything, in this museum comes to life when night falls.  Larry is of course overwhelmed and a bit shaken but the idea of failing his son once again moves him to stick with it.  The former guards, Cecil, Gus and Reginald, prove to be no help but with some quick studying and some determination he discovers ways to manage his new `job'.Ben Stiller is hilarious here, especially when he's exasperated by his circumstances and goes off on those rants of his.  The rest of the cast, chuck full of comedians, are decent but none really excel past Stiller or even come close.  In fact the performances of Robin Williams and Owen Wilson, while solid, are not entirely hysterical.  I will say though that Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan are AMAZING when together as Jedediah and Octavius.  While I absolutely love Ricky Gervais he is somewhat wasted here.  I wish they had given him a better character but alas.  Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs are effective as the three former guards, especially Mickey Rooney who is just plain hysterical.In the end `Night at the Museum' is a great family film that will please everyone, not just the children.  Like was said, this will please the 8-yearold in everyone, and that is so true.  I was pleasantly surprised by the film.  While it is corny at times it is always delightful and is a surefire crowd-pleaser.

1059176,A4IQXCCXDEAKW,B000NOKJBS,Anne P. Mitchell,"[3, 7]","We were looking for a good movie to show for ""Movie Night"" at our house for a group of 9 to 10 year old girls. We read some reviews and decided to take a chance on ""Night at the Museum"".The movie is about Larry Daley (played by Ben Stiller) who is a divorced dad who cannot seem to hold a job, keep a place to live, or pay his bills. Even his own son has a low opinion of him. Everything changes when Larry gets a job as a night watchman in the Museum of Natural History. He has been hired to replace three old security guards played by Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs. What Larry discovers his first night on the job is that an old magical Egyptian stone causes all the museum exhibits to come to life each night until dawn.This is where the movie becomes pretty intense. The first thing to come to life is an enormous dinosaur skeleton. After a lot of chasing around and destruction, it becomes apparent that the dinosaur wants to play fetch. There is a trouble making monkey who among other things, urinates on Larry, lions who want to hunt the other jungle creatures, and Huns at war with other characters. Larry's job becomes attempting to control and to keep all these characters and animals from killing each other and to keep them from leaving the museum. If all the mayhem were not enough, it's revealed that if any of the museum characters do go outside the museum, they will turn to dust at sunrise. We even witness this happening to one of the Neanderthals. The only help Larry gets comes from Teddy Roosevelt who is played by Robin Williams.The story grows when Larry brings his son Nick to the museum to spend the night. That is when a further plot to steal the Egyptian stone is uncovered. It turns out that the three old security guards are ruthless thieves who have been plotting this theft for some time. Attempting to save the stone, Larry and his son try to convince all the warring characters to band together to foil the plot.This movie is full of perilous situations. So much so that out of six 9 to 10 year old girls, four left the room about the time to jungle creatures came to life. When the dinosaur came to life at the beginning, most were hiding behind pillows. Of the two girls that insisted on seeing the whole thing, one had seen the movie already in the theater so was reporting to the other what was going to happen next.For those who love peril, this movie is for you.

I got to see this movie in 3-D, thanks to a new kind of 3-D glasses I found here on Amazon.TV Eyes 3-D Glasses: Watch any movie in 3-DThey turn normal movies 3-D, without any weird equipment, just the glasses. And it made this movie look even better, especially the miniature men, the Cowboy and Roman legionairre looked more solid and real, like they were really living miniature men, they didn't look as matted in, so it was easier to believe in them. It was cool.Probably the highlight of this movie for me, besides the bone dinosaur, was Teddy Roosevelt (played by Robin Williams). Robin Williams gave a perfectly balanced performance, plenty of humor and always a twinkle in his eye, but also a levelheadedness you'd expect from Roosevelt, and a touching drama and humanity that makes him completely lovable.The final scene in the movie was also completely awesome, especially in 3-D because you could see everything much clearer, because everyone and everything in the museum is having a party. You just want to freeze frame it and look at it, it's got everything from a dancing Mammoth, to an Emu playing soccer, to the mini cowboy and Roman driving a toy remote control car and a whole lot more. And when the guard snapped his fingers at the end of the movie I just burst out laughing. I'll leave it to you to see why.This whole movie was complete, no-holds-barred clean fun.

I suppose it might have been because, despite the interesting subject matter, I tend to throw Ben Stiller flicks into the ""seen one, seen `em all"" category, which didn't exactly put me in a big rush. Eventually I caved, and while Night at the Museum was by no means an awful movie, my feelings towards it never really elevated above lukewarm level, and I was actually very surprised at just how much this movie was geared towards children specifically.Obviously I don't need lowbrow potty humor to be incorporated into everything I watch, but knowing this film was written by Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant of Reno 911 fame, I was looking forward to a certain underlying, adult-oriented cleverness that was completely missing. Not that I can't also appreciate a good straightforward family movie when I see one, a la Hotel For Dogs or Mr.Popper's Penguins, but it also seemed fairly watered down by those standards as well. I will say that the CG special effects were VERY well done and the general cinematography was fantastic, but story-wise there wasn't much to go on and any conflicts or plot twists were forced or without much consequence to begin with. (The museum possibly closing down was mentioned, what, once in passing? And the bad guy ""reveal"" felt tacked on post-production.) It was really just random hijinks for the sake of random hijnks without any purpose, which is fine if you're under 6, but there were few genuine laugh-out-loud moments for anybody else. Aside from looking pretty, nothing was really explored thematically to tie it all together which I thought was strange.I realize I shouldn't be docking points based on what I expected or wanted it to be versus what it actually was, but even taken on its own merits, it still could have been so much more. It was entertaining enough in the moment and I don't necessarily regret buying it blindly, but for as much praise as I had heard beforehand, I was prepared for one of those ""something for everyone"" type of films and was slightly let down on all counts.",3,"It's ok, though I didn't realize it was JUST for kids",1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,2157,"['Working', 'museum', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'finally', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'suppose', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'because', 'interesting', 'subject', 'matter', 'tend', 'throw', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'seen', 'one', 'seen', 'em', 'category', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'put', 'big', 'rush', 'Eventually', 'caved', 'Night', 'Museum', 'was', 'means', 'awful', 'movie', 'feelings', 'never', 'really', 'elevated', 'lukewarm', 'level', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'geared', 'towards', 'children', 'specifically.Obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'lowbrow', 'potty', 'humor', 'be', 'incorporated', 'everything', 'watch', 'knowing', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'Thomas', 'Lennon', 'Robert', 'Ben', 'Garant', 'Reno', '911', 'fame', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'certain', 'underlying', 'adult-oriented', 'cleverness', 'was', 'completely', 'missing', 'Not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'also', 'appreciate', 'good', 'straightforward', 'family', 'movie', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'la', 'Hotel', 'Dogs', 'Mr.Popper', 'Penguins', 'also', 'seemed', 'fairly', 'watered', 'down', 'standards', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'say', 'CG', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'VERY', 'well', 'done', 'general', 'cinematography', 'was', 'fantastic', 'story-wise', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'go', 'conflicts', 'plot', 'twists', 'were', 'forced', 'much', 'consequence', 'begin', 'museum', 'possibly', 'closing', 'down', 'was', 'mentioned', 'what', 'once', 'passing', 'bad', 'guy', 'reveal', 'felt', 'tacked', 'post-production', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'random', 'hijinks', 'sake', 'random', 'hijnks', 'purpose', 'fine', ""'re"", '6', 'were', 'few', 'genuine', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'anybody', 'else', 'Aside', 'looking', 'pretty', 'nothing', 'was', 'really', 'explored', 'thematically', 'tie', 'together', 'thought', 'was', 'strange.I', 'realize', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'docking', 'points', 'based', 'what', 'expected', 'wanted', 'be', 'what', 'actually', 'was', 'even', 'taken', 'own', 'merits', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'moment', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'regret', 'buying', 'blindly', 'as', 'much', 'praise', 'had', 'heard', 'beforehand', 'was', 'prepared', 'one', 'something', 'everyone', 'type', 'films', 'was', 'slightly', 'let', 'down', 'counts']",N/A

He finds a job as a night watchman at a museum but feels it is beneath him and he vacillates about staying. Something we begin to think happens often. Not wanting to lose another job he decides to stick it out a little longer. What he finds out is that everything in the museum comes to life at night because of an ancient Egyptian relic.

1059202,A278AF56R7J86,B000NOKJBS,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[31, 35]","A movie where history literally comes alive? No way! But, somehow, this kooky idea works in an endearing and surrealistic way.Ben Stiller stars as Larry Daley, an underachiever with a penchant for bouncing from job to job as he is constantly evicted from one apartment after another. Having had a divorce, Larry shares custody of his son with his ex-wife and her new husband. After finally being fed up with feeling inadequate in the eyes of his son, Larry takes a job as a night watchman at the Museum of Natural History in hopes that the semblance of stability will help earn back his ex-wife's and his son's respect. However, things are not always how they appear, as Larry soon discovers that at night, the museum comes to life...The film has a bit of a slow start as the plot lays the ground work for Larry's desperate acceptance of the night watchman's position. I was left feeling anxious for the hilarity to ensue when the museum finally awakens from it's slumber. Fortunately, once the storyline finally gets to that point, the wacky hijinks commence, one right after the other, causing the film to become far more satisfying. If you overlook the fact that this is a Ben Stiller vehicle (as in, a comedic role that has a fairly cookie-cutter resemblence to most of Ben Stiller's previous roles) the movie turns out to be a wild ride of incredible special effects, and hilarious moments in the interaction between Larry and the newly life-like museum displays.Robin Williams does an amazing job as a wax figure of Teddy Roosevelt, who becomes a sort of guide and mentor to Stiller's character of Larry as Larry struggles to come to terms with the unbelievable things he is witnessing. Owen Wilson also has a small supporting role as a teeny tiny cowboy from one of the displays in the diorama room, who is hell-bent on busting out of his display and doing battle against the Roman General, Octavius (equally tiny) who resides in the display next to his. Wilson's character is also fairly typical of his usual roles, but that doesn't make it any less funny. Actually (if you're looking for a little trivia) Wilson and Stiller only came face-to-face during filming once, for only a few minutes. All of Wilson's scenes were filmed in one day (in front of a green screen so that his character can be shrunk down to size and re-inserted into the film). The production crew placed a toothpick on the various sets so that Stiller had a focal point for where he was supposed to look when delivering his dialogue during the scenes that would eventually include Wilson's shrunken cowboy.This whole movie is one giant leap into the magical realm of suspended reality that Hollywood is so good at creating. Can museums really come to life? No --- but man, it be cool if they did. Keep your eye out for my favorite (and in my opinion, the funniest) scene from the film in which Larry finally confronts Attila the Hun, who makes a habit of chasing him down and attempting to dismember him each night. Larry squares off against Attila and his barbaric horde, and proves he's in control by bringing Attila to tears. You have to see it to truly appreciate the humor. I also enjoyed the keys stealing monkey, Dexter, and his crazy penchant for causing Larry a lot of trouble. As far as special features go, this particular disc only has 2 audio commentaries available. If you're wanting more than that in the special features department, you're probably better off purchasing the 2-disc special edition.Bottom line -- it gets off to a slow start, but eventually picks up and dazzles the audience with it's style, humor, and the general laugh-worthy age old question of ""Can't we all just get along""?",4,I Think that T-Rex Skeleton Wants to Play Fetch? --- and other hilarious reasons to watch this film...,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,3689,"['movie', 'where', 'history', 'literally', 'alive', 'way', 'somehow', 'kooky', 'idea', 'endearing', 'surrealistic', 'way.Ben', 'Stiller', 'Larry', 'Daley', 'underachiever', 'penchant', 'bouncing', 'job', 'job', 'constantly', 'evicted', 'one', 'apartment', 'Having', 'had', 'divorce', 'Larry', 'shares', 'custody', 'son', 'ex-wife', 'new', 'husband', 'finally', 'being', 'fed', 'up', 'feeling', 'inadequate', 'eyes', 'son', 'Larry', 'job', 'night', 'watchman', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'hopes', 'semblance', 'stability', 'will', 'help', 'earn', 'back', 'ex-wife', 'son', 'respect', 'However', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'how', 'appear', 'Larry', 'soon', 'night', 'museum', 'life', 'film', 'bit', 'slow', 'start', 'plot', 'ground', 'work', 'Larry', 'desperate', 'acceptance', 'night', 'watchman', 'position', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'anxious', 'hilarity', 'ensue', 'when', 'museum', 'finally', 'slumber', 'Fortunately', 'once', 'storyline', 'finally', 'point', 'wacky', 'hijinks', 'commence', 'one', 'right', 'other', 'causing', 'film', 'become', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'overlook', 'fact', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'vehicle', 'comedic', 'role', 'fairly', 'cookie-cutter', 'resemblence', 'most', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'previous', 'roles', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'wild', 'ride', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'interaction', 'Larry', 'newly', 'life-like', 'museum', 'displays.Robin', 'Williams', 'amazing', 'job', 'wax', 'figure', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'who', 'sort', 'guide', 'mentor', 'Stiller', 'character', 'Larry', 'Larry', 'come', 'terms', 'unbelievable', 'things', 'witnessing', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'also', 'small', 'supporting', 'role', 'teeny', 'tiny', 'cowboy', 'one', 'displays', 'diorama', 'room', 'who', 'hell-bent', 'busting', 'display', 'doing', 'battle', 'Roman', 'General', 'Octavius', 'equally', 'tiny', 'who', 'display', 'next', 'Wilson', 'character', 'also', 'fairly', 'typical', 'usual', 'roles', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'funny', 'Actually', ""'re"", 'looking', 'little', 'trivia', 'Wilson', 'Stiller', 'only', 'came', 'face-to-face', 'filming', 'once', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'Wilson', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'one', 'day', 'front', 'green', 'screen', 'so', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'shrunk', 'down', 'size', 're-inserted', 'film', 'production', 'crew', 'placed', 'toothpick', 'various', 'sets', 'so', 'Stiller', 'had', 'focal', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'supposed', 'look', 'when', 'delivering', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'would', 'eventually', 'include', 'Wilson', 'shrunken', 'cowboy.This', 'whole', 'movie', 'one', 'giant', 'leap', 'magical', 'realm', 'suspended', 'reality', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'good', 'creating', 'Can', 'museums', 'really', 'come', 'life', 'man', 'be', 'cool', 'did', 'Keep', 'eye', 'favorite', 'opinion', 'funniest', 'scene', 'film', 'Larry', 'finally', 'Attila', 'Hun', 'who', 'habit', 'chasing', 'down', 'attempting', 'dismember', 'night', 'Larry', 'off', 'Attila', 'barbaric', 'horde', 'control', 'bringing', 'Attila', 'tears', 'have', 'see', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'keys', 'stealing', 'monkey', 'Dexter', 'crazy', 'penchant', 'causing', 'Larry', 'lot', 'trouble', 'As', 'far', 'special', 'features', 'go', 'particular', 'disc', 'only', '2', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'available', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'department', ""'re"", 'probably', 'better', 'off', 'purchasing', '2-disc', 'special', 'edition.Bottom', 'line', 'off', 'slow', 'start', 'eventually', 'up', 'audience', 'style', 'humor', 'general', 'laugh-worthy', 'age', 'old', 'question', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'along']",N/A

1059207,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000NOKJBS,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 7]","I should have known that a film like ""Night at the Museum"" was on its way; within the last decade alone, we've had movies in which toys, cars, houses, paintings, and dolls came to life, some of which were appropriate for the whole family. The idea behind this film is certainly a clever one, and to some extent, it was handled properly within the context of the story (based on the book by Milan Trenc). Just imagine it: the exhibits in New York's Natural History Museum come to life every night because of an ancient Egyptian curse. The rule is that no one can be let in or out; if any of the exhibits escape, they'll turn to dust by dawn. This is something the new night guard, Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) learns the hard way, with that bit of information conveniently left out during the job interview. There was an effectively tense moment in which he passes the skeletal T-Rex display, only to realize that the T-Rex itself has mysteriously disappeared. When he turns a corner and switches on his flashlight, he sees the skeleton drinking from a water fountain.It was moments like these that signaled potential. If only the film were actually funny, like the ads make it seem. Maybe the fact that I never once laughed was attributed to this being a family oriented film. Maybe it's because I don't particularly see the humor in a monkey urinating on Ben Stiller. Or maybe it's because the film was filled with a slew of implausible circumstances (and no, I'm not referring to the supernatural components; it's a given that some suspension of disbelief is required for this film). But whatever the reason, ""Night at the Museum"" came off as something that was trying too hard to be entertaining, failing to realize that it was only shooting itself in the foot. Sad, really: it includes Robin Williams as a statue of Theodore Roosevelt, making for some pleasing scenes.I think I was most disappointed by the fact that this story was crafted to be completely humorous. There are many things in a museum that would be terrifying if they were to actually come to life; the moment with the T-Rex skeleton was ruined as soon as it dropped one of its bones at Daley's feet, wanting to play fetch. There's also a scene in which Daley has to lock up the Africa exhibit so as to not be eaten by the lions. If this idea were followed through to the end, it would have made for some good conflict (or at the very least, we'd get to see some cool chase scenes). And then there are the miniature displays of the Roman Empire and the American Old West, each with lead characters--played by Steven Coogan and Owen Wilson--that do nothing but take up precious screen time by constantly picking fights.I think the characters I liked the least were Cecil (Dick Van Dyke), Reginald (Bill Cobbs), and Gus (Mickey Rooney), the three aging night guards Daley is set to replace. Not only do they add little to the scenes that establish plot, they also make an unexpected and unnecessary (not to mention nonsensical) transition near the end of the film. Cecil seems friendly, but continuously evades Daley with vague explanations. Gus is the hothead of the group, and he's never too busy to belittle Daley with names like Hot Dog, Wisecracker, and Weirdy. Reginald is barely developed, serving mostly as a way to complete a trio. Did these characters really need to be included? Did the filmmakers think that portraying old men as caricatures would actually be funny? I suppose younger children will get a kick out of them ... which is disturbing when you think about it.And then there's the human drama, all of which make decent but ultimately unsatisfying attempts at adding depth to the story. It's stated early on that Daley is a good hearted but aimless dreamer, focusing most of his attention on get-rich-quick schemes. It's driving a wedge between his ex-wife, Erica (Kim Raver) and his son, Nick (Jake Cherry). I wish this aspect of the story had been developed a bit more; we're told about Daley's business attempts--such as the Snapper (precursor to the much more successful Clapper)--but we don't actually see this. All we see is a man who needs to get a job because he has bills to pay. Nick was a flat, monotone character, which was problematic because he delivers one of the film's best lines. ""What if you're just a guy who needs to get a job?"" he asks of his father, who honestly believes that something good will come his way.There are also some interactions with Rebecca (Carla Gugino), one of the museum's docents. She's supposedly been writing a nine-hundred-page dissertation on Sacajawea, the one historical figure she's admired for a long time. This is the perfect opportunity for Daley, who has frequently seen the museum's Sacajawea figure (Mizuo Peck) move about behind the display glass; he can hook her up with Rebecca, who has many historical questions to ask. I can't even begin to describe how ridiculous this idea is. At one point, the Teddy Roosevelt statue (who, incidentally, has a crush on Sacajawea) admits that he's not the real former President of the United States; he's merely a wax representation. I think it's safe to assume that Sacajawea is made of the same material. How on earth could she know about the accomplishments of the real--and long since dead--historical figure?There are many, many other characters inhabiting the museum, including: a mischievous monkey who constantly steals Daley's keys; a group of Neanderthals who develop a taste for fire extinguisher foam; the raging Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher) and his posse; a gum-loving Easter Island head (voiced by Brad Garrett); and Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek), the Egyptian pharaoh whose magical golden tablet is responsible for this nightly madness. With such a large and eclectic gathering, you'd think that ""Night at the Museum"" would have been a fun, fascinating experience. While I appreciated the underlying idea, it still didn't seem as if enough went into it, and what little there was went astray early on. I guess it's better for museum exhibits to remain inanimate.",3,Alive from New York,1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,6058,"['should', 'have', 'known', 'film', 'Night', 'Museum', 'was', 'way', 'last',

I mean, come on. It's every child's dream. How many of us stared longingly at our GI Joes, Barbies, or stuffed animals . . . just wishing?When I first saw the Night at the Museum trailer with a T-Rex drinking from a water fountain, I knew the film (based on a book of the same name by Milan Trenc) had potential to be great. But the big question was, could they really pull it off? The movie opened in December 2006, and the public answered with a resounding, ""Yes"". It spent 21 weeks in theaters and domestically grossed $250 million ($572 million worldwide).Main guy Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) is down on his luck. He's recently divorced, about to be evicted from his apartment, and losing his young son's adoration. He needs some stability in his life. The night security position at the museum is a low-man-on-the-totem-pole job, but Larry's willing to give it a try. That is, until he experiences his first night alone and everything from lions, Neanderthals, Civil War soldiers, miniature Roman soldiers, and a replica of an Easter Island moai comes to life. Now the warning he'd received earlier, ""Don't let anything in . . . or out,"" crazily makes sense.There is of course an explanation for all the mayhem. Ever since a golden tablet owned by Egyptian Pharaoh Ahkmenrah made the museum its home, the party starts at midnight. To say more would spoil things. Let's just say all the delightfully predictable shenanigans you'd expect keep things entertaining.With perfect pacing and an all star cast, all the hype is justified. And unlike some of its contemporaries, Night at the Museum doesn't go the potty humor, cheap laughs route. (Even a moment involving a monkey peeing on Larry is truly funny.) Spritzed throughout the film is clever dialogue and lots of visual stimulation, with T-Rex being a definite highlight, of course.The motley crew of Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs as the retiring watchmen who hire Larry is a nice touch classic film buffs will appreciate. With a little make-up Robin Williams bears a striking resemblance to his character Teddy Roosevelt, and he portrays him to a ""t"". Carla Gugino (the mom in the Spy Kids movies) is a tour guide with a fascination for all things Sacajawea. And here's a little trivia for you: The guy who plays Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher) also had a minor role as Jake Goss in the Cloud Ten Pictures ""Apocalypse"" movies Revelation and Judgement, though you'd never recognize him in all the Hun getup.Yes, there's a lot of goofiness in this movie. It comes with the territory. You might go a little wacky too if you had to keep order amidst the chaos of the creatures Larry faces. Of course, kids will be mesmerized by the special effects. Adults will be too, but they'll probably appreciate the humor and banter more. Either way you slice it, Night at the Museum is a film the whole family will want to pop into the DVD player more than once. High expectations aren't a problem. This movie will meet all of them, and leave you smiling to boot. What more could you want?--Reviewed by C.J.

Not only is that where all the action happens, but it's also where Larry discovers his self-esteem and determination, and where he loses and regains his son's respect, and where he falls in love (with a history student played by a very convincing Carla Gugino).The ending had a couple of really cheesy moments that didn't make a whole lot of sense, but that wasn't completely unexpected.All in all, a fun family movie with enough action and silliness for the kids and enough story for the adults.

That job turns out to be night watchman at the famous American Museum of Natural History, right next to New York City's Central Park.  Larry gets a quick briefing from the three retiring nightwatchmen he is replacing (Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobb in a marvelous cameo) and takes up his duties.  However, Larry is stunned to find that as the sun goes down, the Museum's various exhibits come to life.Larry's first night is an hilarious panic-driven flight through the halls from hungry lions, angry Huns, and a mischevious monkey.  Larry is saved by a wax figurine of Theodore Roosevelt (Robin Williams), who provides some vital advice and encouragement.  Larry is ready to quit, but the need to prove to his skeptical son that he can be responsible brings him back to duty the next night, where his efforts to control the chaos are equally funny, but only marginally successful.Larry's third night will be his real trial by fire.  Larry has invited his son to spend the night in the museum with him, but is badly embarrassed when nothing happens at sundown.  Larry discovers that the three retiring watchman have stolen a golden Egyptian tablet that animates the Museum exhibits.  He is able to retrieve the tablet just long enough to reanimate the museum exhibits but then loses control of the watchmen, the tablet, and the exhibits.  In desperation, Larry must mobilize the exhibits to save the day.""Night in the Museum"" is proof that CGI can make almost anything look believable.  Among other challenges, Larry credibly interacts with a talking Easter Island head, a playful dinosaur skeleton, and hundreds of diorama cowboys and Roman legionaires.  The humor is family-oriented as Stiller mugs and deadpans his way through a series of improbable, over-the-top situations.

To do this, he must find a job rather quickly, so he goes to an employment agency for an interview and the last job is one for a night guard at a local museum. Daley, desperately wanting this job, takes it at a moment's notice. When he gets to the job, he finds his is the replacement for three of the former security guards, who are being laid off. They give him a few of the ins and outs, give him a quick tour, and hand him a mysterious instructional manual for his job. From here, Daley learns that all the exhibits come to life at night, and that it is his responsibility to make sure they all stay there.While the movie has its share of problems, there are some great aspects about it. The concept of having to spend the night in a spooky place and have things come to life certainly has been seen before, but it is a fun idea, and with Ben Stiller as the main character, you know it will be good for some laughs. While Stiller is not as funny or outlandish as some of his other roles (such as Meeting the Parents, Dodgeball, Along Came Polly, Envy), his presence onscreen is always fun to watch (for instance, there is a scene where he and a monkey are exchanging slaps to the face after Stiller's character gets irked with the monkey's antics). Some of the scenes and gags are a little childish, but this could be attributed to a younger target audience for the film. Another plus is the special effects for the film: the dinosaur, the miniature Roman Empire and cowboys, as well as the other creatures coming to life were stunning and spectacular.Something that bugged me about the film was the message, directly or indirectly, it seemed to be sending about what it takes to be successful in the eyes of your children. It seemed pretty silly that Stiller had to be some amazing dad or have an amazing job just to not be ""ordinary"" or get his son's ""approval."" Everything about that seemed a little shallow or superficial. The whole relationship with his son seemed to be thrown in the film to make everybody kind of feel good about it at the end, when in truth the film would have been much better served just focusing on Stiller being at the museum and dealing with the conflict of having to keep things under control there. Perhaps the film could have taken a different direction.Another problem was the film's formulaic mode. While the first half of the film has some originality, the latter half becomes predictable, and the final scenes you are basically waiting for the inevitable.Still, problems aside, this is an entertaining family movie and doesn't have many dull moments. It is face-paced enough to keep you moving, and has some humor to keep you laughing.

I want to start off responding to comments from the people who didn't like the movie:1) As far as the historical accuracy, the movie was meant more for fun than as a history lesson so just enjoy it for what it is.2) The older guards (Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, etc.) were NOT good guys in the beginning who later turned bad, they just pretended to be good to con Ben Stiller so they could set him up to take the blame for museum items THEY planned to steal.3) The boss DID fire Ben Stiller but decided to give him a second chance - that DOES happen in real life, especially if the person is believed to be someone bringing money into the business. Maybe it's not the ideal reason for someone to keep his job (if assumed he's bad at it) but in the real world, money is the bottom line to business people whether we like that reality or not.4) I never saw a racist moment and, after watching it TWICE, I don't recall hearing Robin Williams (playing President Teddy Roosevelt's wax statue) making fun of the African language. Maybe you were somehow confusing it with the scene when Ben Stiller pretended to speak whatever language the Huns were speaking (Mongolian or some ancient Asian language) but it wasn't meant to make fun of the language, it was only an attempt to get Attila's attention and stop Attila from screaming at him and attacking him. As for Sacagawea, she was not portrayed as timid or passive, she was portrayed as lonely because she was locked behind a display case, then later shown to have impressive tracking skills. As far as the Mayans and Columbus, they had no direct contact in the movie.5) Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney weren't reduced to cameo roles, they were shown throughout the entire movie right up until the last scene (saying they're grateful that Ben Stiller didn't turn them in) and even shown dancing in their new position as janitors in the closing credits.6) The early dinosaur scenes weren't ""truly frightening"" for little kids - my kids watched the movie and didn't find them scary at all. (My youngest saw this movie in the theater on a school trip so, obviously, the school felt it was tame enough for them to watch.)Other than those actors mentioned above, other well-known actors also appeared including the employment agency woman who is played by Ben's real-life mother, Anne Meara. The boss starts off as a not-so-nice but fun-to-watch character (I thought it was funny that he couldn't finish most of his sentences when reprimanding Ben Stiller but would follow it up with ""If I'm not clear, tell me. Am I clear?""). The parts with Mickey Rooney playing an old, name-calling curmudgeon are funny as he - and others - continually try to belittle Ben Stiller by calling him hopscotch, butterscotch, cupcake, and other silly names (Mickey's character seems to think these names are mean and embarrassing). Owen Wilson (who plays a miniature cowboy from the diorama room) also calls him names such as Gigantor (being that he's huge compared to the miniatures), Cracker Jack, and Loredo. Octavius (another miniature) and the Easter Island statue also call him names of these types. Ben Stiller returns the action by calling some of them names - such as Cool Breeze.I can tell you I enjoyed this movie EVEN THOUGH I'm NOT a fan of Ben Stiller. I gave the movie a chance and I'm glad I did. I've watched it twice in the last two days (rented it), love it, and plan to buy it. My favorite ""characters"" are the dinosaur - who is just a loveable pet at heart who is just bored and wants to play fetch, and the Easter Island tiki-looking head who loves bubble gum and pops a huge bubble on his face. Okay, it's not an intellectual movie, but it's not meant to be. Sometimes even adults like movies, games, etc. that are just silly or fun. (Tell me you don't know any grown men who play kids' video games or moms who like going on theme park rides more than their kids.)Bottom line: Don't go into it expecting to learn history or have an epiphany, just watch it for the fun of it and I'm sure you'll be glad you did.",5,Good Movie (Beware: Spoilers!),1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,4149,"['Maybe', 'who', 'gave', 'bad', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'misunderstood', 'certain', 'parts', 'want', 'start', 'off', 'responding', 'comments', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie:1', 'As', 'far', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'movie', 'was', 'meant', 'more', 'fun', 'history', 'lesson', 'so', 'just', 'enjoy', 'what', 'older', 'guards', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'etc', 'were', 'NOT', 'good', 'guys', 'beginning', 'who', 'later', 'turned', 'bad', 'just', 'pretended', 'be', 'good', 'con', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'could', 'set', 'up', 'take', 'blame', 'museum', 'items', 'THEY', 'planned', 'steal.3', 'boss', 'DID', 'fire', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'decided', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'especially', 'person', 'believed', 'be', 'someone', 'bringing', 'money', 'business', 'Maybe', 'not', 'ideal', 'reason', 'someone', 'keep', 'job', 'assumed', 'bad', 'real', 'world', 'money', 'bottom', 'line', 'business', 'people', 'like', 'reality', 'not.4', 'never', 'saw', 'racist', 'moment', 'watching', 'TWICE', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'hearing', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'playing', 'President', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'wax', 'statue', 'making', 'fun', 'African', 'language', 'Maybe', 'were', 'somehow', 'confusing', 'scene', 'when', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'pretended', 'speak', 'language', 'Huns', 'were', 'speaking', 'Mongolian', 'ancient', 'Asian', 'language', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'make', 'fun', 'language', 'was', 'only', 'attempt', 'get', 'Attila', 'attention', 'stop', 'Attila', 'screaming', 'attacking', 'Sacagawea', 'was', 'not', 'portrayed', 'timid', 'passive', 'was', 'portrayed', 'lonely', 'was', 'locked', 'display', 'case', 'then', 'later', 'shown', 'have', 'impressive', 'tracking', 'skills', 'As', 'far', 'Mayans', 'Columbus', 'had', 'direct', 'contact', 'movie.5', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'were', ""n't"", 'reduced', 'cameo', 'roles', 'were', 'shown', 'entire', 'movie', 'right', 'up', 'last', 'scene', 'saying', ""'re"", 'grateful', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'even', 'shown', 'dancing', 'new', 'position', 'janitors', 'closing', 'credits.6', 'early', 'dinosaur', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'truly', 'frightening', 'little', 'kids', 'kids', 'watched', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'scary', 'youngest', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'school', 'trip', 'so', 'obviously', 'school', 'felt', 'was', 'tame', 'enough', 'watch', 'Other', 'actors', 'mentioned', 'other', 'well-known', 'actors', 'also', 'appeared', 'including', 'employment', 'agency', 'woman', 'who', 'played', 'Ben', 'real-life', 'mother', 'Anne', 'Meara', 'boss', 'off', 'not-so-nice', 'fun-to-watch', 'character', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'could', ""n't"", 'finish', 'most', 'sentences', 'when', 'reprimanding', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'would', 'follow', 'up', ""'m"", 'not', 'clear', 'tell', 'Am', 'clear', 'parts', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'playing', 'old', 'name-calling', 'curmudgeon', 'are', 'funny', 'others', 'continually', 'try', 'belittle', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'calling', 'hopscotch', 'butterscotch', 'cupcake', 'other', 'silly', 'names', 'Mickey', 'character', 'think', 'names', 'are', 'mean', 'embarrassing', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'who', 'miniature', 'cowboy', 'diorama', 'room', 'also', 'names', 'such', 'Gigantor', 'being', 'huge', 'compared', 'miniatures', 'Cracker', 'Jack', 'Loredo', 'Octavius', 'miniature', 'Easter', 'Island', 'statue', 'also', 'call', 'names', 'types', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'action', 'calling', 'names', 'such', 'Cool', 'Breeze.I', 'can', 'tell', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'EVEN', 'THOUGH', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'gave', 'movie', 'chance', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'twice', 'last', 'two', 'days', 'rented', 'love', 'plan', 'buy', 'My', 'favorite', 'characters', 'are', 'dinosaur', 'who', 'just', 'loveable', 'pet', 'heart', 'who', 'just', 'bored', 'play', 'fetch', 'Easter', 'Island', 'tiki-looking', 'head', 'who', 'bubble', 'gum', 'huge', 'bubble', 'face', 'Okay', 'not', 'intellectual', 'movie', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'Sometimes', 'even', 'adults', 'movies', 'games', 'etc', 'are', 'just', 'silly', 'fun', 'Tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'grown', 'men', 'who', 'play', 'kids', 'video', 'games', 'moms', 'who', 'like', 'going', 'theme', 'park', 'more', 'kids', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'learn', 'history', 'have', 'epiphany', 'just', 'watch', 'fun', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",N/A

1059261,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000NOKJBS,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 6]","So this was a fun movie. NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM, based on the kid's book by Milan Trenc, tells the magical, lighthearted story of a down-and-out dad trying to win favor with his son and who, running out of job options, lands a seemingly menial gig as a night watchman for the New York Museum of Natural History, where history comes alive...literally.SPOILERS ALERT: Perpetual loser Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) is fighting for his son's affections while trying to keep himself afloat career-wise. Larry is a hapless dreamer who constantly changes vocations (his latest flops, for example, are a virtual reality driving range and the snapper - think ""clapper""). This constant instability in his life causes his ex-wife (24's Kim Raver) to question whether he's responsible enough to care for their son, Nicky, of whom they share custody. Larry's situation looks even more bleak when compared to the success of his ex-wife's go-getting bond trader beau (Paul Rudd), whose vocation young Nicky now wants to emulate. A chord is struck when Larry promises Nicky that he's meant for better things and Nicky retorts with ""What if you're wrong? You're just an ordinary guy - you should get a job.""Larry, on the verge of being evicted, gets a gig pulling nightshift security duty at the desolate Museum of Natural History, which is steadily showing decline in patronage. He is haphazardly trained by the three elderly security guards he's replacing and is given an instruction manual composed of ratty sheets of paper, of which the top three perplexing directions are: 1) Throw the bone; 2) Lock up the lions or they will eat you; 3) Check the monkey - he probably has your keys. Given an enigmatic warning by Cecil, one of the guards, to ""not let anything in or out,"" Larry, nevertheless, goofs around and dozes off; he wakes up to find that the gigantic skeleton display of the Tyrannosaurus Rex has vanished. It doesn't take him long to learn that, every night, ever since the 1950s, the museum exhibits come alive until sun-up. Larry's job as the night guard is to ensure that these ambulatory exhibits don't get out of hand and, even more important, that they stay indoors as exposure to sunrise will instantly reduce them to dust.An Easter Island statue (voiced by Brad Garrett), the cruel Attila the Hun, Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams), a pickpocketing capuchin monkey, faceless Civil War figures, dioramas populated by warring cowboys, Mayans, and Roman legionnaires, and a mystical Egyptian tablet...I can't remember them all, but these are only some of the animated things that run rampant every night. Unlike the friendly 26th president, most of the museum creatures are hostile or indifferent and are requiring of unique methods in handling. Larry garners historical knowledge from lovely museum employee Rebecca (Carla Gugino, SIN CITY, SPY KIDS) to learn of his charges' backgrounds. But that proves to be not enough as an unforeseen element enters into the scene, threatening to cause incalculable damage to the prestigious museum and, even worse, imperil the enchanted exhibits. Can Larry, who seems not to have stuck to anything in his life, save the day and make his kid proud?In many ways, NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM is reminiscent of JUMANJI, except that JUMANJI offers a more heightened sense of jeopardy. Initially there is a real perception of danger, which is brought to a crescendo with the arrival of the daunting T-Rex. But the cute resolution to the ensuing chase sequence immediately belies whatever ounce of peril was promised. The special effects department gets an A+ here. The skeletal dinosaur is spectacular, the miniscule warriors look convincing in their dimensional relation to their surroundings, and I enjoyed the Easter Island statue. The lions, however, merely look passable.Ben Stiller again channels that lovable loser who was so effectively showcased in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. I get a kick out of how Stiller's quirkiness effortlessly gains him access to a ridiculously manic side. For instance, he makes an aggrieved promise to the thieving monkey (who's twice stolen his museum keys) that ""a storm is coming,"" but, then, we learn that the ""storm"" takes the form of Larry merely substituting plastic toy keys for the real ones (""See! I told you a storm was coming!""). Anyway, Stiller cracks me up and he's decent in this film. The ever relaxed Owen Wilson shines again as he continues to play himself, and in another cowboy role. He and Stiller sure do have great comedic chemistry. Robin Williams is nicely subdued and even touching as the fatherly Teddy Roosevelt, who harbors a crush on a fellow exhibit figure and later owns up to certain insecurities, even disclosing that he's aware of his waxen origins. The all star cast is bolstered by the presences of Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs as the trio of guards who were ""retired"" due to downsizing. True, they're not given much to do (though Rooney is amusing), but it's nice to see them still working. Ricky Gervais is humorous as the uptight museum director who isn't capable of finishing a sentence or an adage. Carla Gugino is someone who I wish had participated more as she's reduced here to an ambivalent romantic interest role. Meanwhile, Mizuo Peck as the beautiful, wistful guide Sacajawea shines and communicates to the audience, even though she doesn't have a lot of dialogue.NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM is a fun foray into escapism. I liked it quite a bit, except for the bogus manner in which Larry resolved his quarrel with Attila the Hun. In its sensibilities, it's definitely catered to the kids, although the Three Stooges scene between Larry and the monkey (you'll know which one) is universally funny. The screen images are guaranteed to elicit delighted responses from the kids in the audience. If nothing else, hopefully, this movie will pique the curiosity of the young 'uns enough that they bug their parents to take them to the musem and learn about history. And that's not a bad thing. Three and a half stars.",4,This is pretty good family fare...and it's even a tad educational,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,6027,"['So', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'AT', 'THE', 'MUSEUM', 'based', 'kid',

It is a sentimental comedy, all in all. You will learn that you cannot trust old people who are ready to commit a crime whose guilt will be attributed to someone younger, and that only because they want to make some money to expand their old age pension slightly. You will learn that you must not trust appearances and that what looks pretty dead is nothing but alive and what looks pretty alive is nothing but wax or stuffed artifact. You will also learn that when one wants one can always dominate a situation as soon as there is an emergency because any emergency will mobilize everyone towards the only goal of saving the day and seizing the chance that is going by. You will also learn that only a father can make a miracle when he is trying to impress his own son. And all the rest is nothing but trashy exhaust waste water, especially what mothers may say and mothers' boyfriends along with them. History and natural history are two very vivid and lively subjects even if their museums are generally boring and dying with and of boredom.

Suddenly, the Tyrannosaurus starts moving, and then chasing him! The lions and other animals also come to life. So do Attila the Hun, a group of ancient Roman soldiers, cowboys, American Civil War combatants, various native peoples, Sacagawea and other members of the Lewis and Clark expedition, President Teddy Roosevelt, etc. So does an Easter Island face, which calls him ""Dumb Dumb"" and demands ""gum gum"".Attila the Hun tries to tear him limb from limb.

The museum displays are a mess. Larry is about to be fired. And the former security guards, having earlier made a copy of the key on a bar of soap, return and attempt to steal the magic Egyptian tablet and other goods.

It is Ben Stiller's special charge to keep the animals and walking statues from leaving the museum grounds. The animation that allows dinosaur skeletons to come to life -- along with copper statues, jade sculptures and stone monoliths - makes this absolutely wonderful. Seeing the halls teeming with Eskimos, Mongols warriors, Victorian English, Indian maids and terracotta Chinese burial figurines was a treat.

What I didn't know was how much I would end up enjoying it.  Its a rare Hollywood treat these days to see a film that not only you can take the whole family to, but can almost guarantee that everyone will also fully enjoy.While Ben Stiller will probably never be considered a great actor, he certainly has pretty good judgement of which films to pick from that will make a great impression on the majority of film-goers these days.  Will Smith is another who has an uncanny ability to pick (for the most part) great rolls that tend to further his career and keep us fans wanting to see what he'll do next.  While I wouldn't put Ben in the category of Action Hero like Will, Ben certainly has a certain something about him that just makes him fun to watch.Museum is an example of a good script actually turning into a great film.  Who can't love seeing a film that features Owen Wilson, Robin Williams, Dick Van Dyke AND Mickey Rooney?  I consider that to be near genius casting, and it paid off Big Time.  Ben's character is a nice enough fellow who just can't seem to catch a break.  He moves from job to job and place to place and his stability is forcing some desperate possibilities in his relationship with his son.  He takes a moment to apply for the Night Watchman at the Museum, and is hastily trained by Dick Van Dyke and left for the night much too quickly--especially for what ends up happening after the sun goes down.  Part of the microscopic instructions he is left with is a collection of papers stapled together which gives him step-by-step instructions of what will happen, and what to do when it does.One phrase by his trainer comes back to haunt him that first night: Don't let anybody in...OR out.  He can't understand what letting someone out means--but he catches on rather quickly.  The T-Rex skeleton is one of the first exercises he runs into.  Followed by a group of monkey's bent on playing tricks on him and of course the small dioramas come to life as well creating a miniature war between those in the Wild West and the Armies of ancient Rome.  There is SO much to enjoy here that you can't help but hope for a sequel--if done right of course.  The addition of Robin Williams as Teddy Roosevelt was a nice touch as well.  Along the way we discover a re-ignited relationship with Ben and his son...a possible new love interest and of course what good action/adventure isn't complete without a conspiracy?  All out fun is the best way to describe this latest outing for Ben Stiller.  The effects are fantastic and helped to make the movie even more enjoyable...so if you are looking for something the whole family can watch -- and the whole family will also ENJOY...this is a no-brainer.",5,Night at the Museum gave me a Night of Fun...,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,2818,"['When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Night', 'Museum', 'pretty', 'much', 'knew', 'instantly', 'wanted', 'see', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'enjoying', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'treat', 'days', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'take', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'everyone', 'will', 'also', 'fully', 'enjoy.While', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'considered', 'great', 'actor', 'certainly', 'pretty', 'good', 'judgement', 'films', 'pick', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'impression', 'majority', 'film-goers', 'days', 'Will', 'Smith', 'who', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'pick', 'most', 'part', 'great', 'rolls', 'tend', 'further', 'career', 'keep', 'fans', 'wanting', 'see', 'what', ""'ll"", 'do', 'next', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'Ben', 'category', 'Action', 'Hero', 'Will', 'Ben', 'certainly', 'certain', 'something', 'just', 'fun', 'watch.Museum', 'example', 'good', 'script', 'actually', 'turning', 'great', 'film', 'Who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'love', 'seeing', 'film', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'AND', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'consider', 'be', 'near', 'genius', 'casting', 'paid', 'off', 'Big', 'Time', 'Ben', 'character', 'nice', 'enough', 'fellow', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'break', 'job', 'job', 'place', 'place', 'stability', 'forcing', 'desperate', 'possibilities', 'relationship', 'son', 'moment', 'apply', 'Night', 'Watchman', 'Museum', 'hastily', 'trained', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'left', 'night', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'especially', 'what', 'up', 'happening', 'sun', 'down', 'Part', 'microscopic', 'instructions', 'left', 'collection', 'papers', 'stapled', 'together', 'step-by-step', 'instructions', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'does.One', 'phrase', 'trainer', 'back', 'haunt', 'first', 'night', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anybody', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'letting', 'someone', 'out', 'rather', 'quickly', 'T-Rex', 'skeleton', 'one', 'first', 'Followed', 'group', 'monkey', 'bent', 'playing', 'tricks', 'course', 'small', 'dioramas', 'come', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'creating', 'miniature', 'war', 'Wild', 'West', 'Armies', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'SO', 'much', 'enjoy', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'hope', 'sequel', 'done', 'right', 'course', 'addition', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'well', 'way', 'discover', 're-ignited', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'son', 'possible', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'course', 'what', 'good', 'action/adventure', ""n't"", 'complete', 'conspiracy', 'fun', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'latest', 'outing', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic', 'helped', 'make', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'so', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'also', 'ENJOY', 'no-brainer']",N/A

1059283,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000NOKJBS,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[3, 3]","Ben Stiller stars in this very funny movie that's loaded with awesome special effects.Stiller stars as Larry Daley.  Larry is a down-on-his-luck guy who is trying to not get evicted from his home, while at the same time trying to find a decent job and maintain a relationship with his young son.  Finally, a job becomes available at the Museum of Natural History for a night watchman.  Larry accepts, but he soon realizes that he's gotten much more than he bargained for.Larry is replacing three other guards who have been let go by the museum.  They are Cecil (Dick Van Dyke), Gus (Mickey Rooney), and Reginald (Bill Cobbs).  Cecil gives Larry a brief tour of the museum and leaves him with a confusing set of instructions, then he leaves Larry on his own.  The instructions contain confusing clues, such as ""throw the bone"" and ""lock up the lions, or they will eat you"".  Soon, Larry sees the meaning of the instructions, as all of the exhibits come to life at night.  A golden tablet has cast a mysterious spell over the museum which causes the exhibits to come to life.  But when the sun comes up, the exhibits go back to their regular displays.  But, if one is caught outside when the sun rises, it will turn to dust.The large T-Rex is the first exhibit Larry sees, and, following the directions, he throws him a bone, and the T-Rex runs off after it.  In the nick of time, Larry manages to lock up the lions, but he meets a new and aggravating friend; Dexter the monkey.  Dexter has a nasty habit of stealing Larry's keys and just being a general nuisance.  Other interesting exhibits include Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams), Sacagawea, and Attila the Hun.  Perhaps the funniest are the cowboys and the Roman warriors.  These exhibits are close by, and the cowboys, led by Jed (Owen Wilson) are continually feuding with the Romans and General Octavius.  Larry must keep them separated, or they'll kill one another.Teddy Roosevelt serves as Larry's confidant.  He encourages Larry to continue as the watchman, even though, after the first couple of nights, Larry is unsure if he should return.  Larry wants to make a good impression on his son and bring some stability to his own life, so he continues on at the museum.  However, there's trouble brewing and Larry and the others must stop it, or the exhibits will lose their ability to come to life at night.  Will Larry be successful, or will his now beloved museum friends become just plain exhibits?  Larry and his friends must act quickly before its too late!This is an excellent movie.  Ben Stiller and Robin Williams highlight an all-star cast, and their performances are top-notch.  It was also a treat to see Mickey Rooney and Dick Van Dyke acting in a movie again.  There are many things to like about this film, but the special effects steal the show.  Watching a miniature Owen Wilson slug it out with Octavius is loads of fun, as is watching a life-size T-Rex skeleton chasing after a bone like a puppy.  The story is well-conceived, and I was laughing throughout the entire movie.I give this great movie my highest recommendation.  The laughs are non-stop, and the cool special effects will keep you glued to the screen.

1059284,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000NOKJBS,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 3]","""Night at the Museum,"" the newest comedy from director Shawn Levy (Cheaper by the Dozen, The Pink Panther) driven by funnyman Ben Stiller, is a children's movie made for children and children alone. Basically, the movie put me to sleep. I won't say it was bad. I just felt it was too derivative. It was Jumanji remade to take place in a museum except it was missing any interesting plot dynamics. This is yet another movie about divorced parents fighting over their kids.The effects were fine. The T-Rex motions looked like some were reused from Jurassic Park. I got the impression that a lot of the effects also involved reusing old Jumanji graphics. Some looked better, some didn't. The movie was busy enough that any flaws in the effects didn't matter. The problem with this movie is that the euphoria is too forced. It isn't inspired by the writing or the plot. Ben Stiller is an often dependable comic actor, but he's forced to squeeze laughs out of a dreadfully unfunny script, and fails miserably. He simply comes off as obnoxious and annoying throughout the film. Usually his kinetic comic style works, but usually he works with good scripts. The talents of several other actors are wasted as well, including Owen Wilson and Robin Williams (who seems almost humiliated to be involved in this film).  The trio of old security guards (Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, Bill Cobbs) were impressively spry, considering they're all in their 80s. They looked like they were enjoying themselves and had else to do.The kids love the non-stop wild antics of pretty much everything, and the extremely cute, slightly evil, capuchin monkey. My little quibble is how the film doesn't slow down, but when Owen Wilson comes on the screen it makes everything better. Overall, the movie was exactly what the trailer reveals and very little more. A false sense of hurray and hoopla is forced out onto the viewer. Beside that ""Night at the Museum,"" has a very good message as well, about the importance of family, responsibility, and living up to one's potential. These points may be missed by many who only watch for the surface content, but I was impressed by the message.",3,"Watching this movie is a nice way to pass the time, nothing more.",1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,2159,"['Night', 'Museum', 'newest', 'comedy', 'director', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'driven', 'funnyman', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'children', 'movie', 'made', 'children', 'children', 'alone', 'Basically', 'movie', 'put', 'sleep', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'bad', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'derivative', 'was', 'Jumanji', 'remade', 'take', 'place', 'museum', 'was', 'missing', 'interesting', 'plot', 'dynamics', 'yet', 'movie', 'divorced', 'parents', 'fighting', 'kids.The', 'effects', 'were', 'fine', 'T-Rex', 'motions', 'looked', 'were', 'reused', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'got', 'impression', 'lot', 'effects', 'also', 'involved', 'reusing', 'old', 'Jumanji', 'graphics', 'looked', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'was', 'busy', 'enough', 'flaws', 'effects', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'problem', 'movie', 'euphoria', 'too', 'forced', ""n't"", 'inspired', 'writing', 'plot', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'often', 'dependable', 'comic', 'actor', 'forced', 'squeeze', 'dreadfully', 'unfunny', 'script', 'miserably', 'simply', 'off', 'obnoxious', 'annoying', 'film', 'Usually', 'kinetic', 'comic', 'style', 'works', 'usually', 'good', 'scripts', 'talents', 'several', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'wasted', 'well', 'including', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'almost', 'humiliated', 'be', 'involved', 'film', 'trio', 'old', 'security', 'guards', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'were', 'impressively', 'spry', 'considering', ""'re"", '80s', 'looked', 'were', 'enjoying', 'had', 'else', 'do.The', 'kids', 'love', 'non-stop', 'wild', 'antics', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'extremely', 'cute', 'slightly', 'evil', 'capuchin', 'monkey', 'little', 'quibble', 'how', 'film', ""n't"", 'slow', 'down', 'when', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'screen', 'everything', 'better', 'Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'trailer', 'reveals', 'very', 'little', 'more', 'false', 'sense', 'hurray', 'hoopla', 'forced', 'viewer', 'Night', 'Museum', 'very', 'good', 'message', 'as', 'well', 'importance', 'family', 'responsibility', 'living', 'up', 'one', 'potential', 'points', 'may', 'be', 'missed', 'many', 'who', 'only', 'watch', 'surface', 'content', 'was', 'impressed', 'message']",N/A

This bugs his son, since his stepdad is successful and he wants his real dad to be successful too. Stiller finally lands a job as a night watchman at a museum. Dick Van Dyke ""as a former night watchman"" hands him the keys and a list of things to do. He never mentions that everything comes to life at night time.The movie is more fun in the beginning since it runs out of some steam by the end. Despite nice visual effects that are always entertaining, it's the cast that makes the movie. Despite Richard Roeper knocking Robin Williams as Theodore Roosevelt, I think he was pretty restrained in the part.

It's not until one slightly dirty one-liner directed towards Stiller and a monkey that we're reminded of the usual Robin Williams.Owen Wilson also gets some laughs as a mini little cowboy who's always picking a fight with someone.

I don't watch too many new movies, but I was ""forced"" to watch ""Night at the Museum"" as someone had purchased it for me as a gift. It was a pleasure to watch it, and I would happily recommend it to others.The sets are really beautiful in this film. From elaborate Roman soldiers to beautiful African safari scenes, this movie spared no expense on the stage. It makes for highly entertaining viewing even before you take any other aspects into account.The humor is quite funny as well. Mickey Rooney definitely shows his age, but he spits insults with fury, and definitely brings a smile to your face. Van Dyke is less funny, but he is also good in his role (I think the funniest Van Dyke scene might actually be in the end credits.) As far as the remainder of the cast, I wouldn't say the actors (Stillar, Owen Wilson, and Robin Williams) are as funny as the scenes and lines they are given. There are some truly ""laugh out loud"" funny moments. (The ""Gulliver's Travels"" set stands out in my mind.) While the movie loses a little bit of the humor steam an hour through, this brings laughs to the end.The one possible ""turn off"" is the fact that the film is incredibly cheesy. This isn't a problem for someone who just wants to watch some entertainment and is willing to overlook the cheesiness, but if you try and take the movie seriously at all, you will be turned off by Stillar's ""chat with the Huns,"" for instance. Take the film with a grain of salt as you are supposed to, though, and this hits the right buttons.And who is this film intended for? Well, the kids should love it from beginning to end.

Larry needs a job to at least stay in his son's life. He ends up as a night watchmen replacing three old codgers. They are the very funny Micky Rooney, Dick van Dyke & Bill Cobb. The museum is downsizing it's staff & the three old men do not like it one bit. They do not plan to leave quietly. They also do not tell Larry the secret of the curse on the museum. In essence, the whole place comes alive, at night when the doors close. The exhibits want to escape but will die if they leave the confines of the building. Chaos ensues with teriffic special effects. Larry runs amok with wild carnivores, ancient tribes, Roman warriors & hundreds of other exhibits animating, including the afore mentioned dinosaur. Some great co-stars appear including Owen Wilson as a miniature cowboy & a rather good sized part for Robin Wiiliams astride a horse as Teddy Roosevelt. He kind of holds the whole movie together. Meanwhile, the three fired guards are planning a massive jewelry heist under the nose of the clueless Larry.

1059297,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B000NOKJBS,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[0, 0]","""Night in the Museum"" is a light-hearted, fantastic tale of a night watchman (Ben Stiller) in a natural history museum who soon learns, once the building's doors are locked and the lights are dimmed, that there's more than meets the eye when it comes to the museum's lifelike exhibits.  In other words, maybe the exhibits aren't simply lifelike, but actually alive.This a funny, often wondrous movie that strikes exactly the right balance between real and make-believe. With its divorced dad (Stiller) trying to connect with his kid, the movie is grounded enough in reality that the fantasy elements stand out nicely when they occur.  But the movie also has enough of a storybook quality that one doesn't feel the need to pummel it with questions of logic. In other words, the movie's tone kept me from asking too strenuously why no one has brought the secret of the museum to the attention of the museum's curator or board of trustees or whoever, so that the living exhibits could be shared with a public that would surely be eager to buy tickets to see them.  After all, stories and fables often feature magical secrets that must be kept, so it's easy to accept the observance of that rule here.The film is well served by its DVD presentation, too.  The image on the standard DVD is sharp and sparkling, which nicely shows off the film's generous and top-notch special effects.  The sound palette is spacious with good clarity.  I purchased the single disc version of ""Night in the Museum"", and the special features are limited to a couple of commentary tracks.  But there's also a two-disc special edition with additional special features, as well as a Blu-Ray version that's also pretty loaded.  But really, the standard DVD looks and sounds really good and should suffice for most people.If you enjoy comedy, fantasy, and adventure elements in your movie choices, give ""Night in the Museum"" a try.

Or that everything in the books or museums are so ancient that there is no way to possibly relate to any of the information contained within?  Well, then you need to watch the blockbuster hit ""Night at the Museum"" and gain a whole new appreciation for the words often used by the History Channel ""Where history comes alive"".""Night at the Museum"" focuses on an underachieving, somewhat slacker inventor named Larry (Ben Stiller), who in order to find some semblance of stability for his son takes a job as night watchman for New York City's Museum of Natural History.  Larry's new job appears on the surface to be nothing more than a job filled with the same monotonous routine night after night, but what he soon discovers is that this museum is anything but normal.  What the retiring night watchmen (Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs) failed to mention, and unbeknownst to everyone else that either works there or visits the museum, is that the exhibits all come to life at night.I have to say that for a movie that is essentially taking the basic plot of Pixar's ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" where toys come to life when people aren't around, and tweaking it to apply to museum exhibits, the movie works very well.  The choice of focusing on famous characters from history was fun, because it allowed audiences to have fun and maybe even learn a few things about some of these characters they had merely read about.  The story can be somewhat predictable (then again, most movies are and that doesn't make it bad) and appears to be aimed more at kids at first, but the subplot involving Larry's need to provide stability for his son imbues the film with a bit more maturity than expected, giving adults something they can relate to.  Assisting in steering the movie away from merely being another kids movie that parents will be bored to tears by is director Shawn Levy, who gave the film a healthy balance of humor, heart, and plenty of sight-gags that the whole family can enjoy.  The stellar cast led by Ben Stiller (who is essentially playing the same type of character that he's done in countless other films), Robin Williams, and Owen Wilson elevates this movie from being just another average special effects/sight gag-heavy comedy by injecting plenty of clever humor, heart, and humanity into each of their characters to distract from the somewhat predictable proceedings and borrowed plot device.Even though it wasn't the most original, the movie is well balanced with plenty of hilarious jokes and sight gags to keep you entertained while presenting history in a whole new way.

She even bought it to school for her class to watch.  The teacher won't allow Sponge Bob movies, but this movie is cleaner than Sponge Bob.  I was very suprised that it was SO good.  When I purchased it I didn't have high expectations of it from the previews I had seen.  It was precious!!  The actors all did a great job and the story has a real meaning.  It is good for young children to learn names of people in history, this movie allows it.  It is not like many movies you purchase for your child where they get scared in parts, this one stays friendly and light.  It is something your whole family will enjoy.  It is probably one of the best family movies I have seen in a while.  I enjoyed that it was a new and fresh idea.  Probably being a histroy buff, that helped me enjoy it, but my husband liked it too.  It is a movie you don't get bored watching and you can watch it over and over.  Some movies you watch once and don't want to see them again, even if they are good.  This one you will want to watch, over and over, which is how it is with kids.  How perfect!!

1059307,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000NOKJBS,K. Driscoll,"[5, 5]","Night at the Museum is based on a kids' book of the same name.  The film follows a divorced father named Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) who is eager to impress his son Nick with his career.  Larry gets a job at The Museum of Natural History.  He becomes the museum's night watchman.  The museum contains an Egyptian artifact that animates everything inside when the sun goes down.  We see wax statues of Neanderthals, Attila the Hun, Theodore Roosevelt (Robin Williams) and Sacagawea come alive.  Animals from the African exhibit come to life and run amok as does a bust from Easter Island and even a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton and a Woolly Mammoth.  Most enjoyable are the tiny figure exhibits of the Mayans, some cowboys led by Jedediah Smith (Owen Wilson) and the Romans led by Gaius Octavius (Steve Coogan).  We see the chaos this brings to Larry's job but in the end it all works in his favor.Visually and from an educational standpoint Night at the Museum has its merits.  It is thoroughly entertaining and probably great for kids.  It plays out in ways which we've seen before, so it's not a perfect movie but it will suffice within its genre.  There are also enough adult aimed jokes to entertain beyond a younger audience and that should be no surprise given the history of those who wrote this movie (The State, Reno 911).  Beyond those I've already mentioned, this great cast includes Carla Gugino, Mickey Rooney, Dick Van Dyke, Paul Rudd and many others.  Paul Rudd plays Nick's stepfather and makes for some of the more genuinely funny moments.There is little to criticize beyond the lack of depth, which is of course what we can expect from a kid's movie.  Ben Stiller is at times great and at times just sort of doing what he needs to do.  He is undeniably likeable and critics were a little harder on him than I thought he deserved.  The historical depictions are not perfect but my criticisms here are mainly nitpickings.  Attila the Hun is not portrayed accurately from an ethnic standpoint and the Neanderthals were much more intelligent and fully capable of using fire.  However, Night at the Museum is forgiven because it is an innocent and entertaining story with a lot of harmless fun.",4,Very Entertaining and Overall Great for Kids,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,2203,"['Night', 'Museum', 'based', 'kids', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'divorced', 'father', 'named', 'Larry', 'Daley', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'who', 'eager', 'impress', 'son', 'Nick', 'career', 'Larry', 'job', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'museum', 'night', 'watchman', 'museum', 'Egyptian', 'artifact', 'everything', 'inside', 'when', 'sun', 'down', 'see', 'wax', 'statues', 'Neanderthals', 'Attila', 'Hun', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Sacagawea', 'come', 'alive', 'Animals', 'African', 'exhibit', 'come', 'life', 'run', 'amok', 'as', 'bust', 'Easter', 'Island', 'even', 'Tyrannosaurus', 'Rex', 'skeleton', 'Woolly', 'Mammoth', 'Most', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'tiny', 'figure', 'exhibits', 'Mayans', 'cowboys', 'led', 'Jedediah', 'Smith', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Romans', 'led', 'Gaius', 'Octavius', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'see', 'chaos', 'Larry', 'job', 'end', 'favor.Visually', 'educational', 'standpoint', 'Night', 'Museum', 'merits', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'probably', 'great', 'kids', 'out', 'ways', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'will', 'suffice', 'genre', 'are', 'also', 'enough', 'adult', 'aimed', 'jokes', 'entertain', 'younger', 'audience', 'should', 'be', 'surprise', 'given', 'history', 'who', 'wrote', 'movie', 'State', 'Reno', '911', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'great', 'cast', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'many', 'others', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Nick', 'stepfather', 'more', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'little', 'criticize', 'lack', 'depth', 'course', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'kid', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'times', 'great', 'times', 'just', 'sort', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'undeniably', 'likeable', 'critics', 'were', 'little', 'harder', 'thought', 'deserved', 'historical', 'depictions', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'criticisms', 'here', 'are', 'mainly', 'nitpickings', 'Attila', 'Hun', 'not', 'portrayed', 'accurately', 'ethnic', 'standpoint', 'Neanderthals', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'intelligent', 'fully', 'capable', 'using', 'fire', 'However', 'Night', 'Museum', 'forgiven', 'innocent', 'entertaining', 'story', 'lot', 'harmless', 'fun']",N/A

1059309,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B000NOKJBS,Kevin J. Loria,"[92, 108]","This solid family movie from director Shawn Levy (the new PINK PANTHER, CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2) comes from a solid book like Jumanji, and Zathura, the 1993 kid's  mystery-comedy of the same name.Like the original story,  Larry (or was it Hector originally) becomes a night guard at New York's Museum of Natural History,in order to ""grow up"" in the eyes of his ex-wife and his son. He expects to have an easy time. But on his first night, he dozes off, then wakes up to a missing dinosaur skeleton.Soon his learns that history really comes alive at this museum and he's got his hands full keeping it in line.Ben Stiller, as Larry, panics his way from exhibit to exhibit,as only he knows how. Briefly intiated by the original nightwatchmen, played by comedy, TV and film legends Dick Van Dyke,Bill Cobbs and Mickey Rooney.The retiring watchmen are worth the price of admission (watch the closing credits as they reveal the ultimate fate of the three characters and Mr. Van Dyke shows that he can still chimney-sweep with the best of them.Owen Wilson yet again teams-up with Stiller for a small part literally, he's a miniature from an historical diorama (see Starsky & Hutch, The Royal Tenenbaums, Meet the parents, Permanent Midnight, Zoolander for more super Stiller/Wilson team-ups). Actually the role is more than a cameo and is worthy of the story. The two play off each other superbly, like a modern-day Bing & Hope, only funny (I Kid, I Kid).Another standout casting is Robin Williams lending Larry a hand as an animated-wax Teddy Roosevelt. Williams is able to savory his moments of insanity as a relatively static historical mentor while enfusing others with moving realism and soulfulness (seriously).Loads of great visuals, especially at the IMAX engagements, like the animated dog-like T-Rex, Mammoths, stampedes and more. Definitely in the spirit of Jumanji, only with much more heart.",5,Take your family to the Museum,1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,1896,"['solid', 'family', 'movie', 'director', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'new', 'PINK', 'PANTHER', 'CHEAPER', 'BY', 'THE', 'DOZEN', '2', 'solid', 'book', 'Jumanji', 'Zathura', '1993', 'kid', 'mystery-comedy', 'same', 'original', 'story', 'Larry', 'was', 'Hector', 'originally', 'night', 'guard', 'New', 'York', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'order', 'grow', 'up', 'eyes', 'ex-wife', 'son', 'have', 'easy', 'time', 'first', 'night', 'then', 'up', 'missing', 'dinosaur', 'skeleton.Soon', 'learns', 'history', 'really', 'alive', 'museum', 'got', 'hands', 'full', 'keeping', 'line.Ben', 'Stiller', 'Larry', 'panics', 'way', 'exhibit', 'exhibit', 'only', 'how', 'Briefly', 'intiated', 'original', 'nightwatchmen', 'played', 'comedy', 'TV', 'film', 'legends', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'Mickey', 'Rooney.The', 'retiring', 'watchmen', 'are', 'price', 'admission', 'watch', 'closing', 'credits', 'reveal', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'three', 'characters', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'can', 'still', 'chimney-sweep', 'best', 'them.Owen', 'Wilson', 'yet', 'again', 'teams-up', 'Stiller', 'small', 'part', 'literally', 'miniature', 'historical', 'diorama', 'see', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Meet', 'parents', 'Permanent', 'Midnight', 'Zoolander', 'more', 'super', 'Stiller/Wilson', 'team-ups', 'Actually', 'role', 'more', 'cameo', 'worthy', 'story', 'two', 'play', 'other', 'superbly', 'modern-day', 'Bing', 'Hope', 'only', 'funny', 'Kid', 'Kid', 'standout', 'casting', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'lending', 'Larry', 'hand', 'animated-wax', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'Williams', 'able', 'savory', 'moments', 'insanity', 'relatively', 'static', 'historical', 'mentor', 'enfusing', 'others', 'moving', 'realism', 'soulfulness', 'seriously', '.Loads', 'great', 'visuals', 'especially', 'IMAX', 'engagements', 'animated', 'dog-like', 'T-Rex', 'Mammoths', 'stampedes', 'more', 'Definitely', 'spirit', 'Jumanji', 'only', 'much', 'more', 'heart']",N/A

Many of them have too much violence, sex or language for little eyes to see and little ears to hear.  Others are just plain boring for adults to sit through with their children.  ""Night At The Museum"" isn't perfect, but it's one of the best ""family"" films to come out in a long time.  It keeps things fairly clean for the youngsters (just a little language and a bit of comedic violence) but has a wonderful plot and excellent character development for the older crowd.  Also, the special effects will push your gee-whiz button no matter how old you are.Ben Stiller is Larry Daley, an out-of-luck, out-of-work, divorced everyman with big dreams.  Unfortunately you don't get paid for dreaming, so Larry has to find steady work to stay above water.  His son has a lot of faith in him, but after countless let downs he is slowly losing hope for his father.  Larry manages to get a job at the Museum of Natural History when management decides to downsize the nightwatchman crew.  The current crew, wonderfully portrayed by legends Dick Van Dyke, the ageless Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs, handpick Larry to replace them.  They have a secret about the museum at night:  the exhibits literally come to life.It's fun to watch Larry try to keep the museum from falling apart once the sun goes down.  Things can get pretty chaotic when you have Attila the Hun and his minions, cavemen, the animals of Africa, a trouble-making monkey, miniature cowboys and Roman soldiers, and an Easter Island head with a chewing gum fetish running amok.  Larry does receive a little bit of help from Theodore Roosevelt (played by a thankfully toned-down Robin Williams) in holding a little bit of order, but even Teddy is busy crushing on Sacajawea.  About midway through the film, a plot twist is thrown in that gives the film a reason to keep progressing instead of just being a generic fantasy about a museum that comes to life at night.  The twist is simple enough for young minds to digest, but still fun enough to keep adults and older kids engaged with the film.Although the special effects are amazing, it's the characters that make this movie worth watching.  Owen Wilson, Ricky Gervais, Carla Gugino, and Paul Rudd are superb in their respective (and in most cases, brief) roles and manage to make the most of their limited screen time.The Special Edition DVD features your typical helping of documentaries, bloopers and commentaries, but the real gem here is the film.

I've since learned my lesson to see for myself and make up my own mind.If you're looking for special effects, you get plenty of that here whether it is a T-Rex skeleton playing fetch, zoo animals going crazy (think Jumanji), miniature Roman Legionnaires and Cowboys fighting it out and more, you get it all.  It's all wholesome fun too.  No violence or blood or death or even bad endings and it is nice to see that kind of refreshing entertainment nowadays.From an acting viewpoint, nice talent was put together here in the form of Ben Stiller, Robin Williams, Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs.

Larry also has a problem with keeping an apartment.  Larry is an inventor, but his ideas are one step behind the next guy.  Larry needs to hold down a job and he needs to regain the faith of his son.Larry's big chance comes when he applies for the job of night guard at the Museum of Natural History.  The job seems easy enough.  Keep anyone from getting in, and keep anything from getting out.  Huh?  Why would anything get out?  Well, it turns out that everything in the museum comes alive at night (I will leave it for you to learn why that happens).  The t-rex skeleton is as frisky and friendly as a big puppy.  The Neanderthals are interested in fire.  Attila the Hun wants to kill someone, except for the person who truly understands him.  Then there are the lions and a monkey with an overactive bladder.It would seem that Larry has plenty to keep his hands full, but someone adds to his problems when they decide to rob the museum.  There is only one way for Larry to get the stolen artifacts back and to save his job, and that is to get the help of the exhibits.  It will be one wild ride!Ben Stiller is far from being my favorite comedy actor, and there are a few awkward moments in this movie, but Stiller manages to overcome the awkward moments and have a lot of fun with this role.  The comedy is generally family friendly and most children four or five and above will understand that it is not actually possible for museum displays to come to life (but it would sure be fun if they did).Stiller has lots of incredible help in this movie.  Veteran actors Dick Van Dyke, Bill Cobbs, Mickey Rooney, Robin Williams and Owen Wilson add a lot of dimension and spice to this film.  This film is unusual in that there are numerous other well-known actors that complement this phenomenal crew, including Steve Coogan, Anne Meara, Mizuo Peck and Carla Gugino.  I was particularly pleased to see Robin Williams in an unusual role (Teddy Roosevelt).  Williams gets to be philosophical and wise and a catalyst for action rather than being the center of the action.If there is a drawback to the movie, it is that it takes a little bit to set up the background for Stiller's character before we get to centerpiece of the movie.  Once the action begins, it propels us at breakneck speed through the rest of the movie, which allows us to overlook little plot holes that crop up along the way.""Night at the Museum"" is creative, interesting, humorous and just plain fun.  The concept is a throwback to various movies and horror shows where inanimate objects come to life.  However, digital effects allow the director of this movie a dimension to the animation not previously possible, and we are the beneficiaries.  Fans of comedy fantasies (which are relatively rare) will love this movie, as will fans of any of the aforementioned actors.  Children who understand that t-rex skeletons do not come to life at night will also love this movie.Enjoy!",4,Fun Concept,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,3024,"['Larry', 'Daley', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'small', 'problem', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'one', 'Larry', 'also', 'problem', 'keeping', 'apartment', 'Larry', 'inventor', 'ideas', 'are', 'one', 'step', 'next', 'guy', 'Larry', 'hold', 'down', 'job', 'regain', 'faith', 'son.Larry', 'big', 'chance', 'when', 'job', 'night', 'guard', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'job', 'easy', 'enough', 'Keep', 'anyone', 'getting', 'keep', 'anything', 'getting', 'out', 'Huh', 'Why', 'would', 'anything', 'get', 'out', 'Well', 'out', 'everything', 'museum', 'alive', 'night', 'will', 'leave', 'learn', 'why', 't-rex', 'skeleton', 'frisky', 'friendly', 'big', 'puppy', 'Neanderthals', 'are', 'interested', 'fire', 'Hun', 'kill', 'someone', 'person', 'who', 'truly', 'Then', 'are', 'lions', 'monkey', 'overactive', 'bladder.It', 'would', 'seem', 'Larry', 'plenty', 'keep', 'hands', 'full', 'someone', 'problems', 'when', 'decide', 'rob', 'museum', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'Larry', 'get', 'stolen', 'artifacts', 'back', 'save', 'job', 'get', 'help', 'exhibits', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'wild', 'ride', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'far', 'being', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'actor', 'are', 'few', 'awkward', 'moments', 'movie', 'Stiller', 'overcome', 'awkward', 'moments', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'role', 'comedy', 'generally', 'family', 'friendly', 'most', 'children', 'four', 'five', 'above', 'will', 'understand', 'not', 'actually', 'possible', 'museum', 'displays', 'come', 'life', 'would', 'sure', 'be', 'fun', 'did', '.Stiller', 'lots', 'incredible', 'help', 'movie', 'Veteran', 'actors', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'add', 'lot', 'dimension', 'spice', 'film', 'film', 'unusual', 'are', 'numerous', 'other', 'well-known', 'actors', 'complement', 'phenomenal', 'crew', 'including', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'Anne', 'Meara', 'Mizuo', 'Peck', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'was', 'particularly', 'pleased', 'see', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'unusual', 'role', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'Williams', 'be', 'philosophical', 'wise', 'catalyst', 'action', 'rather', 'being', 'center', 'action.If', 'drawback', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'set', 'up', 'background', 'Stiller', 'character', 'get', 'centerpiece', 'movie', 'action', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'rest', 'movie', 'overlook', 'little', 'plot', 'holes', 'crop', 'up', 'way', 'Night', 'Museum', 'creative', 'interesting', 'humorous', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'concept', 'throwback', 'various', 'movies', 'horror', 'shows', 'where', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'come', 'life', 'However', 'digital', 'effects', 'allow', 'director', 'movie', 'dimension', 'animation', 'not', 'previously', 'possible', 'are', 'beneficiaries', 'Fans', 'comedy', 'fantasies', 'are', 'relatively', 'rare', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'will', 'fans', 'aforementioned', 'actors', 'Children', 'who', 'understand', 't-rex', 'skeletons', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'life', 'night', 'will', 'also', 'love', 'movie.Enjoy']",N/A

This is wearing on his son Nick (Jake Cherry) who at ten years old is already developing a back up plan in case his first career choice doesn't pan out.At the urging of his ex-wife (Kim Raver), Larry decides to get a steady job to help put stability into his son's life.  The only job the employment agency thinks he is qualified for is night guard at the museum.

Between dusk and dawn, the entire collection of the museum comes to life.  Suddenly, he finds himself dealing with everything from a dinosaur skeleton that wants to play catch to Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams).  The animals in the African display want to eat him or take his keys.  And in the diorama room, it's not Cowboys verses Indians, but Cowboys verses Romans.

While there are a couple momentarily scare scenes, the majority of them are played for laughs, so only the most easily frightened will be scared by it.Ben Stiller is perfect as Larry, and the rest of the cast is great as well.  I especially liked seeing Dick van Dyke on the big screen again.  Owen Wilson and Steve are perfect as the leaders of the Cowboys and Romans.  They play off each other perfectly.These days, we are used to great special effects, and this movie is no exception.  Yet they are part of the story and never take over.The movie's only flaw is the story.  The themes are familiar, but since there are so many of them, they get short changed.  Taking out one would have made for a stronger film since the rest of them would have been better developed.  And there's a third act plot twist and needed a better set up earlier in the film.  Still, these are minor complaints.While the story could have been a little better, that's a minor quibble.  For the most part, this is exactly what it sets out to be, fun entertainment the entire family will enjoy.",4,You'll have a Good Night at This Museum,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,2524,"['Larry', 'Daley', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'jobs', 'Again', 'brilliant', 'inventions', 'are', 'either', 'too', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'already', 'taken', 'wearing', 'son', 'Nick', 'Jake', 'Cherry', 'who', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'already', 'developing', 'back', 'up', 'plan', 'case', 'first', 'career', 'choice', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out.At', 'urging', 'ex-wife', 'Kim', 'Raver', 'Larry', 'get', 'steady', 'job', 'help', 'put', 'stability', 'son', 'life', 'only', 'job', 'employment', 'agency', 'qualified', 'night', 'guard', 'museum', 'will', 'be', 'replacing', 'three', 'old', 'guards', 'Dick', 'van', 'Dyke', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'downsized', 'due', 'budget', 'cutbacks.His', 'first', 'night', 'job', 'surprise', 'Between', 'dusk', 'dawn', 'entire', 'collection', 'museum', 'life', 'Suddenly', 'dealing', 'everything', 'dinosaur', 'skeleton', 'play', 'catch', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'animals', 'African', 'display', 'want', 'eat', 'take', 'keys', 'diorama', 'room', 'not', 'Cowboys', 'verses', 'Indians', 'Cowboys', 'verses', 'Romans', 'Larry', 'clue', 'how', 'deal', 'nonsense', 'Will', 'find', 'way', 'will', 'quit', 'when', 'going', 'tough', 'always', 'When', 'trailers', 'started', 'showing', 'up', 'movie', 'summer', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'was', 'rewarded', 'fun', 'flick', 'lots', 'humor', 'premise', 'Larry', 'attempts', 'deal', 'things', 'only', 'things', 'funnier', 'are', 'couple', 'momentarily', 'scare', 'scenes', 'majority', 'are', 'played', 'laughs', 'only', 'most', 'easily', 'frightened', 'will', 'be', 'scared', 'it.Ben', 'Stiller', 'perfect', 'Larry', 'rest', 'cast', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Dick', 'van', 'Dyke', 'big', 'screen', 'again', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Steve', 'are', 'perfect', 'leaders', 'Cowboys', 'Romans', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'perfectly.These', 'days', 'are', 'used', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'exception', 'are', 'part', 'story', 'never', 'take', 'over.The', 'movie', 'only', 'flaw', 'story', 'themes', 'are', 'familiar', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'get', 'short', 'changed', 'Taking', 'out', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'stronger', 'film', 'rest', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'developed', 'third', 'act', 'plot', 'twist', 'needed', 'better', 'set', 'up', 'earlier', 'film', 'Still', 'are', 'minor', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'better', 'minor', 'quibble', 'most', 'part', 'exactly', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'entire', 'family', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A

1059338,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B000NOKJBS,Marshall Lord,"[2, 2]","There are not too many films which my children love and which also have enough in them to keep adults amused that we can watch them as a family without boring Mum and Dad. This is one of them.Based on the book by Milan Trenc, this film tells the story of kind-hearted but unsuccessful inventor Larry Daley (played by Ben Stiller.) Larry's ex-wife is concerned that Larry's lack of success is having a negative effect on their son Nick (Jake Cherry). Desperate to get some stability in his life so that his son can be proud of him, Larry gets the one job available - as night security guard at the city museum.The staff at the museum are a very mixed bunch. The director is the boss from hell, played by Ricky Gervais, portraying possibly an even worse person to work for than his character from ""The office,"" David Brent. The friendly and helpful receptionist, Rebecca, played by Carla Gugino, is a much more pleasant person to have as a colleague. And the team of three elderly security guards from whom Larry is to take over just seem very strange. They are played respectively by Dick van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs. I hadn't seen Dick van Dyke or Mickey Rooney in any film made in the past thirty years and didn't even realise they were still around, but Dick van Dyke in partiular proves that his sense of fun and comic talent is very much alive.A few minutes after everyone else has left the building, leaving Larry alone on his first night at the museum, Larry finds to his horror that the skeleton of a T-Rex comes alive and chases him. Within a few minutes, all the musuem exhibits have likewise come to life - from tiny diorama figures of Incas, Roman legions, and wild west cowboys, through lions, monkeys and woolly mammoths to the mummy of an egyptian pharoah and the giant statues which guard him. Larry needs the help of the statue of President Teddy Rosevelt (Robin Williams) to settle everything down. But that is only the start of his adventures.As you would expect from a film with such a big name cast, there is some really good acting: apart from Stiller, Gervais, van Dyke, and Williams, there are excellent performances from Steeve Coogan as Octavius, the leader of the legion of tiny roman soldiers, and Owen Wilson in an uncredited performance as ""Jedidiah,"" the leader of the tiny cowboys.There are also some very funny lines: my favourite was when Larry exclaims in surprise to the Pharoah ""You speak English"" and gets the reply ""I went to Cambridge University"" (Wll, he was displayed there ...).Another was when Larry asks Rebecca about Sacajawea, the indian scout for Lewis and Clark ""Was she deaf? She seems a bit unresponsive.""Rebecca replied ""That's because she's a statue...""Not everyone will like this, but if you want something to keep small children amused which also contain a wealth of subtle detail to amuse the adults, I can strongly recommend ""A night at the museum.""

Especially the cowboys led by Ben Owen(Jedediah) and the Romans led Steve Coogen(Octavius).One thing I thought was funny was when Jedediah had Octavius in stocks.  To which the Museum director chews out Stiller for playing a prank.  I thought it would have been funny to have a few more shots of the diorama characters doing things to each other.One scene I thought went on far longer then it should was the slapping fight between Stiller and the Capuchin.One scene I could not stand was Stiller psycho analyzing Genghis Kahn.

Larry (Ben Stiller) is a divorced parent whose many failures as an entrepreneur are beginning to take a toll on his young son. In search of job stability, Larry accepts a position as the night watchman at New York City's Museum of Natural History. However, the elderly guards Larry's been hired to replace (Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs) neglect to mention one small detail about the job: As soon as the sun goes down, everything in the museum comes to life! The giant T-Rex skeleton wants to play fetch, the cowboys constantly battle with the Roman soldiers, and Attila the Hun is out for blood. Ultimately, Larry discovers an organized heist that will result in the museum losing its magical powers, and it's up to him to put a stop to it.There are definitely some logistical problems with this movie. Why are none of the museum displays protected behind glass cases? How is it that Larry appears to work 14 -hour days and never get any sleep? However, if you're willing to ignore those things, this film is actually a lot of fun. The supporting cast, which includes Owen Wilson and Robin Williams, is excellent. There are a lot of funny lines in the film, and obviously the visual effects are quite impressive and entertaining.

1059349,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000NOKJBS,Mel Odom,"[4, 5]","I almost made the mistake of blowing this movie off as another comedy I wasn't much interested in.  If not for my wife and 9-year-old son, I might not have gone.  I say might not have because the trailers were so darn interesting.I'm not particularly a fan of Ben Stiller's.  His movies are generally hit or miss with me.  I watch them with my teenagers occasionally, just to keep my coolness factor intact.  But I don't feel a driving need to see his films.However, Stiller performs wonderfully in NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM, and he's aided and abetted by Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, Owen Wilson, Robin Williams, and Carla Gugino in roles that are simple but elegant.  Stiller stars as the divorced father of a young son, a boy who tries to worship his father as a hero, but who keeps getting his heart broken because his dad is a near-do-well and can't even seem to hold a job.Larry Daley (Stiller) goes to pick his son up for the little league hockey game and hesitates about telling him he's lost his job again and will have to move.  The impassioned speech between Larry's son Nick (Jake Cherry) is an emotional one that touches the heart.  I felt that the father/son scenes were better in this movie than even all the moviemaking magic used to bring the exhibits to life.  It all felt so honest and real.Determined not to let his son down, Larry goes to the employment agency to get a job -- ANY job.  He ends up taking the position of a night guard at the museum.  Although he isn't happy about the job, Larry's ecstatic that he isn't going to let his son down.However, the job at the museum turns out to be nothing like Larry had ever thought it would be.  At night, you see, all the exhibits come to life and run around the museum.  Larry ends up losing his notes about what to do, then has to be saved by Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams).One of the things that strains the credibility of the film is how much pure knowledge Larry is able to accumulate in one day before his next shift.  He goes in with a plan, and it almost works.Watching Larry fail and succeed and fail yet again is great.  This is what family stories, and comedies, seem to do best.  The special effects are breathtaking and hilarious.

1059351,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000NOKJBS,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 3]","Every other year, I visit my in-laws in Michigan and have the opportunity to see my nieces and nephews.  This is an opportunity for my wife and I to take the kids to see a movie, and I vociferously encouraged Night at the Museum over Eragon.  Because I'm a bitter, jealous author...I mean I thought Eragon would be too intense for the young'uns (six-years-old).Anyway, off we went. I've tinkered with the idea of a museum coming to life in my own short stories, so I was excited to see a big special effects budget applied to the concept.  I was not disappointed.Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) is having difficulty holding down a job.  He's recently suffered a divorce from wife Erica (Kim Raver) and is trying to retain visiting rights to his son Nick (Jake Cherry). If he doesn't find a steady job soon, he may not see his son ever again.  Pretty serious stuff for a kid's movie.Desperate, Larry takes a job as a night watchman at the Museum of Natural History.  The current security guards (Dick Van Dyke as Cecil, Mickey Rooney as Gus, and Bill Cobbs as Reginald) are long past their prime, so all three positions are being replaced by just Larry.  What they didn't tell Larry was that the museum has been coming to life since the 50s.This include the perpetually warring miniature dioramas of cowboys led by Jedadiah (Owen Wilson) and Romans led by Octavius (Steve Coogan), the wax models of Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck) and Lewis (Martin Christopher) and Clark (Martin Sims), Teddy Roosevelt on his horse (Robin Williams), an entire Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton, Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher), Neanderthals in a perpetual quest for fire, a bronze statue of Christopher Columbus (Pierfrancesco Favino) and a wide range of animals.  And oh yeah, a monkey.Larry's job isn't just to keep people from coming into the museum at night, it's to keep the museum exhibits from escaping.  At sunrise, they all turn back to their static forms; if caught outside, they turn to dust.  As Larry figures out how to keep everyone straight, he eventually discovers the secret that animates this crazy museum every night: a gold Egyptian tablet that belongs to an interred mummy.  Which begs the question: why is it the mummy bellowing in his sarcophagus to be let out, night after night?Night at the Museum veers wildly from adult-oriented content (""I ain't quittin' you!"" shouts the cowboy to the Roman) to kid-oriented slapstick (Larry slaps the crap out of a monkey).  These scenes range from being hilarious to a little awkward.  In an era when Rosie O'Donnell gets chastised for imitating the Chinese language with nonsense sounds, it's a little shocking to see Stiller do the same to Attila the Hun (and be understood!).  At one point, Roosevelt gets cut in half by a wagon wheel...although he's only wax, so it's okay.  There's even a semi-icky romance between good ole' Teddy and Sacajawea.I was entertained by the movie, especially the image of Stiller being attacked by the miniature dioramas (there's even an obligatory Asian shouting and pointing at a rampaging Godz-Stiller). That's my adult take on the movie.  But who cares what I think, what did my nieces and nephews think?My twelve-year-old nephew liked it.  He found the slapstick amusing and the animation was interesting enough to keep his attention. My seven-year-old niece was ambivalent, but endorsed the movie anyway.  My nine-year-old nephew got up to use the bathroom at least three times, and it was clear it didn't hold his interest.  My youngest niece, the six-year-old, at one point was frightened (I think the T-Rex scared her, although it's really not that bad) and said she wanted to leave, but she stuck it out.Night at the Museum tries to cater to everybody and stumbles along the way.  And yet, it endorses everyone from different cultures getting along.  I'm still not entirely convinced that the Museum of Natural History looks like it does in the movie, so I'm planning to visit soon.  Maybe that's the point: Any movie that encourages children and adults to visit a museum and learn about history is okay in my book.",3,Any movie that encourages visiting a museum is okay in my book,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,4087,"['other', 'year', 'visit', 'in-laws', 'Michigan', 'have', 'opportunity', 'see', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'opportunity', 'wife', 'take', 'kids', 'see', 'movie', 'vociferously', 'encouraged', 'Night', 'Museum', 'Eragon', ""'m"", 'bitter', 'jealous', 'author', 'mean', 'thought', 'Eragon', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'intense', ""young'uns"", 'six-years-old', '.Anyway', 'went', ""'ve"", 'tinkered', 'idea', 'museum', 'coming', 'life', 'own', 'short', 'stories', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'big', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', 'applied', 'concept', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.Larry', 'Daley', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'having', 'difficulty', 'holding', 'down', 'job', 'recently', 'suffered', 'divorce', 'wife', 'Erica', 'Kim', 'Raver', 'trying', 'retain', 'visiting', 'rights', 'son', 'Nick', 'Jake', 'Cherry', ""n't"", 'find', 'steady', 'job', 'soon', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'son', 'ever', 'again', 'Pretty', 'serious', 'stuff', 'kid', 'movie.Desperate', 'Larry', 'job', 'night', 'watchman', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'current', 'security', 'guards', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Cecil', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Gus', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'Reginald', 'are', 'long', 'prime', 'three', 'positions', 'are', 'being', 'replaced', 'just', 'Larry', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Larry', 'was', 'museum', 'been', 'coming', 'life', '50s.This', 'include', 'perpetually', 'warring', 'miniature', 'dioramas', 'cowboys', 'led', 'Jedadiah', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Romans', 'led', 'Octavius', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'wax', 'models', 'Sacajawea', 'Mizuo', 'Peck', 'Lewis', 'Martin', 'Christopher', 'Clark', 'Martin', 'Sims', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'horse', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'entire', 'Tyrannosaurus', 'Rex', 'skeleton', 'Attila', 'Hun', 'Patrick', 'Gallagher', 'Neanderthals', 'perpetual', 'quest', 'fire', 'bronze', 'statue', 'Christopher', 'Columbus', 'Pierfrancesco', 'Favino', 'wide', 'range', 'animals', 'oh', 'yeah', 'monkey.Larry', 'job', ""n't"", 'just', 'keep', 'people', 'coming', 'museum', 'night', 'keep', 'museum', 'escaping', 'sunrise', 'turn', 'back', 'static', 'forms', 'caught', 'outside', 'turn', 'dust', 'Larry', 'out', 'how', 'keep', 'everyone', 'straight', 'eventually', 'secret', 'crazy', 'museum', 'night', 'gold', 'Egyptian', 'tablet', 'interred', 'mummy', 'question', 'why', 'mummy', 'bellowing', 'sarcophagus', 'be', 'let', 'out', 'night', 'night', 'Night', 'Museum', 'veers', 'wildly', 'adult-oriented', 'content', 'ai', ""n't"", 'quittin', 'cowboy', 'Roman', 'kid-oriented', 'slapstick', 'Larry', 'crap', 'monkey', 'scenes', 'range', 'being', 'hilarious', 'little', 'awkward', 'era', 'when', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'chastised', 'imitating', 'Chinese', 'language', 'nonsense', 'sounds', 'little', 'shocking', 'see', 'Stiller', 'do', 'same', 'Attila', 'Hun', 'be', 'understood', 'one', 'point', 'Roosevelt', 'cut', 'half', 'wagon', 'wheel', 'only', 'wax', 'okay', 'even', 'semi-icky', 'romance', 'good', 'ole', 'Teddy', 'Sacajawea.I', 'was', 'entertained', 'movie', 'especially', 'image', 'Stiller', 'being', 'attacked', 'miniature', 'dioramas', 'even', 'obligatory', 'Asian', 'shouting', 'pointing', 'rampaging', 'Godz-Stiller', 'adult', 'take', 'movie', 'who', 'what', 'think', 'what', 'did', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'think', 'twelve-year-old', 'nephew', 'liked', 'found', 'slapstick', 'amusing', 'animation', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'attention', 'seven-year-old', 'niece', 'was', 'ambivalent', 'endorsed', 'movie', 'anyway', 'nine-year-old', 'nephew', 'got', 'up', 'use', 'bathroom', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'was', 'clear', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'interest', 'youngest', 'niece', 'six-year-old', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'frightened', 'think', 'T-Rex', 'scared', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'said', 'wanted', 'leave', 'stuck', 'out.Night', 'Museum', 'tries', 'cater', 'everybody', 'stumbles', 'way', 'yet', 'everyone', 'different', 'cultures', 'getting', 'along', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'entirely', 'convinced', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'movie', ""'m"", 'planning', 'visit', 'soon', 'Maybe', 'point', 'movie', 'children', 'adults', 'visit', 'museum', 'learn', 'history', 'okay', 'book']",N/A

It's derivitave (more of a sequel to Jumanji than Zaruthra, in spirit at least), it has stars being woefully underused (Robin Williams in twinkly eye mode instead of acting mode, Ricky Gervais playing the museum director just like his Office manager character) and a script which is painfully obvious at times.  In short, it lacks a heart, much like Shawn Levy's other movies.Through necessity, Stiller takes a job as nightwatchman at the Museum, as the three older guards are being laid off - the museum is on hard times.  However, thanks to an ancient bit of Egyptian mumbo jumbo, the exhibits all come to life at night - threatening to either wreak chaos on the city, or give Stiller his chance to shine and finally impress his son.. wonder which happens..?But, let's admit it, I laughed at times, and stuck with it to the end.  In fact, it actually took a few turns that did surprise me, and strung out a one line concept into a fairly enjoyable kids flick, with enough cameos bursting out of every scene to keep the adults fitfully amused.  Effects are all passable to excellent, and Ben Stiller actually does just about enough to carry the movie through.  Jake Cherry is a satisfyingly non-annoying child actor as Ben Stiller's son, I laughed at Gervais, and who knew Dick van Dyke and Mickey Rooney were still alive, never mind acting...It's certainly not an all time classic, but it will keep the kids amused.... 4/10, nudged up to 3 stars since it is after all, aimed at kids.",3,Passes muster as a kids movie...,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,1541,"['would', 'be', 'pretty', 'easy', 'lay', 'movie', 'derivitave', 'more', 'sequel', 'Jumanji', 'Zaruthra', 'spirit', 'least', 'stars', 'being', 'woefully', 'underused', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'twinkly', 'eye', 'mode', 'instead', 'acting', 'mode', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'playing', 'museum', 'director', 'just', 'Office', 'manager', 'character', 'script', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'times', 'short', 'heart', 'much', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'other', 'movies.Through', 'necessity', 'Stiller', 'job', 'nightwatchman', 'Museum', 'three', 'older', 'guards', 'are', 'being', 'laid', 'off', 'museum', 'hard', 'times', 'However', 'thanks', 'ancient', 'bit', 'Egyptian', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'exhibits', 'come', 'life', 'night', 'threatening', 'wreak', 'chaos', 'city', 'give', 'Stiller', 'chance', 'shine', 'finally', 'impress', 'son..', 'wonder', 'happens..', 'let', 'admit', 'laughed', 'times', 'stuck', 'end', 'fact', 'actually', 'took', 'few', 'turns', 'did', 'surprise', 'out', 'one', 'line', 'concept', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'kids', 'flick', 'enough', 'cameos', 'bursting', 'scene', 'keep', 'adults', 'fitfully', 'amused', 'Effects', 'are', 'passable', 'excellent', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'actually', 'just', 'about', 'enough', 'carry', 'movie', 'Jake', 'Cherry', 'satisfyingly', 'non-annoying', 'child', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'son', 'laughed', 'Gervais', 'who', 'knew', 'Dick', 'van', 'Dyke', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'were', 'still', 'alive', 'never', 'mind', 'acting', 'certainly', 'not', 'time', 'classic', 'will', 'keep', 'kids', 'amused', '4/10', 'nudged', 'up', '3', 'stars', 'aimed', 'kids']",N/A

Queens.Stiller is OK in the role but never totally engaging enough to carry the film, as he must. There are plenty of other supporting roles, all doing pretty light duty except for ROBIN WILLIAMS who makes an excellent wax version of Teddy Roosevelt and inhabits the role as an actor rather than a flip comedian.And no mistake about it, the premise is a wonderful one, with dioramas and historical figures coming to life at the American Museum of Natural History, all enhanced by some incredible CGI effects that are jaw-droppingly real. Unfortunately, most of the humor involving sight gags and hokey dialog is sophomoric in nature.Nice work by DICK VAN DYKE, MICKEY ROONEY and BILL COBBS as old-timers being forced out of their job by newcomer Stiller, all three with an agenda that is not revealed until midway through the story and makes for a very manic explosion of movement for the finale.RICKY GERVAIS is excellent as the tongue-tied manager at the museum, and RAMI MALEK, OWEN WILSON and STEVE COOGAN are excellent as museum figures come to life.Kids should get a howl out of it and adults will find some pleasure in seeing some of the veteran actors do their thing.Alan Silvestri's busy background score is remarkably effective in capturing the mood as well as the manic moments.Summing up: Worth seeing for the CGI effects alone.

Why not, right?I liked it.Before going to see it for myself, I was perplexed by the numbers this movie was posting at the box office. The only rationale I could attribute to its success was that it was pretty much the only ""kids movie"" out, but that couldn't be enough of a driving force to get that many people to go see it. But now it all makes sense.If you are in search of a thought-provoking, well-written plot with rich character development, Night at the Museum should not be on your list. If you want a fun (and at times very funny) film with a good message for your kids, make sure Night at the Museum is on your list. The story was a little hokey; I can admit that. But it was still entertaining.Ben Stiller (who I do not typically enjoy) is Larry, the consistently out-of-work, divorced father who takes a job as night security for The Museum of Natural History. The job sounds simple enough, but he soon finds it is much more than he bargained for when on his first night everything in the museum comes to life. Yes. Literally.The story, very narrowly, is about Stiller being a hero to his kid. Much more broadly, the story shows kids how much fun history can be (apparently as long as you don't have the teachers I had in high school!). The movie has probably influenced an increase in trips to museums all over the country by exciting children about the mysticism of the exhibits. Any movie that can be entertaining and educational like that deserves praise. I will even admit that it caused me to consider a trip to a museum one of these days.But the real highlight for me was the constant banter between Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan, as Jedidiah and Octavius respectively.

I'd be surprised if nothing happened after this film came out.This film features an all-star cast, many of whom were drawn to the project because they wanted to work with the leading man, Ben Stiller.  Stiller, playing stereotypical well-meaning-but-otherwise-deadbeat dad Larry Daley, gives a performance that allows me to look past the stereotype and get into his new predicament.  That predicament being his new job as a night shift security guard at the Museum of Natural History in New York City, a museum where all the exhibits come to life every night thanks to an ancient Egyptian tablet which has been on display there for several years.  While initially making a mess of things night after night, Daley seeks to better himself in his new job so that his son, played by Jake Cherry, will once again look up to him instead of his bond-trading stepfather.  With some help from President Theodore Roosevelt, played by Robin Williams, he slowly starts to succeed in keeping a lid on things, but problems continue to present themselves.As I've said, there is an all-star cast in this film, coming at you either in person, via CGI effects, or through voice acting.  I'm actually surprised I don't know Carla Gugino, the actress playing the love interest, but she did quite well, so no fault on her there.While the story of inanimate things magically coming to life is just about as old as time itself, this was still a very good film.  The cast, not surprisingly, all did well, with Robin Williams being my favorite and Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson tying for second.  Jake Cherry was all right, but a bit bland and stereotypical...his motives and story ark were readily identifiable, as were those of his mother, played by Kim Raver.  I'm a bit disappointed that Paul Rudd didn't get more scenes or a joke or two.  But he was supposed to be the straight-man in this, so I'll let that go.A special mention goes out to Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs.  These three legends of Hollywood deserve to be in a category of their own as they played three elderly security guards who work at the museum and give our protagonist tips on how to manage things.  I'm glad their story turned out to have more to it, but I wish that had been flushed out more.  While their motives were understandable, it was a twist that felt a bit too sudden.  Did the filmmakers want to give these guys more screen time?  A good thought but a real story needed to go with it.  Nevertheless, these three men were great to watch.This is a great film with a great cast and a very decent story.  Kids and parents can watch it together without anyone losing interest.

To win back the support of his son, down-on-his-luck dreamer Larry Daley (Stiller) accepts a stable job as the night security guard at New York's Museum of Natural History but soon learns that this simple job is more than he ever imagined. At nightfall, an ancient Egyptian tablet brings the animals, statues and other exhibits to live and Larry becomes the one responsible of keeping order amidst all the chaos. ""Night at the Museum"" is a lively and funny thrill ride for the whole family. The fantasy adventure features some amusing comic moments and eye-popping special effects. The all-star cast also includes Dick Van Dyke, Carla Gugino, Mickey Rooney, Owen Wilson and Robin Williams. Despite some negative reviews by critics, ""Night at the Museum"" became one of the highest grossing movies of the year with over $550 million worldwide.Don't pass up the chance to check out ""Night at the Museum"" on DVD. The 2007 blockbuster fantasy comedy is presented in its theatrical 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a sharp video transfer with rich colors and great resolution.

1059397,A3BJDFGSLXFB36,B000NOKJBS,R. Legendre,"[9, 15]","I was excited to see this film on DVD since I missed it at the theater. I really like Ben Stiller and the special effects shown in the trailer looked very well done.But, good special effects do not a great film make.The story really bored me. After 20 minutes, even my four year old daughter got bored with it and decided to go play in her room. Stupid me, I should have gone with her, but I stayed until the bitter end.The humor is low-brow and very juvenile. For example, an Easter island statue asks Stiller, ""Dum-dum brought some gum gum?"". Obviously, the statue wants some chewing gum! Hahahahahahahahah! Oh! Wait! Stop it! I can't breathe! That's so funny! Whooooooooo!The plot is overly simplistic with most of the screen time revolving around nonsensical shenanigans that go on during the museum's off hours. A lot of time is filled in with scenes of historical figures running around the halls for no apparent reason, a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton that acts more like a dog than a dinosaur, a monkey that likes to steal keys, etc. Oh, what comical capers we are forced to witness.Comic superstars Ben Stiller and Robin Williams are capable of so much more, but they can only do so much with the script they were given.This film was hailed as a family movie and I guess it was since there was no profanity, no nudity, no sexual innuendo, no violence (except some cartoonish violence), no drug use, etc. Family movies are great and I am all for them, but at least we should expect to be entertained.Come on, Hollywood.

Dyke as Cecil Fredericks,Carla Gugino as Rebecca Hutman,Mickey Rooney as Gus,Bill Cobbs as Reginald,Owen Wilson as Jedediah and others.This is neat concept taken from a children's book of the same name.The story is neat and clean,generally,and has a good pace.The story finds Stiller as a struggling single father,trying to keep afloat in so far as looking after his son is concerned.He has had to move a lot over a short period of time and his ex is hounding him.As a last ditch effort he goes to an employment agency who sends him to apply as a security guard at the Museum of Natural History,in the big apple.Acting vets Dick Van Dyke,Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs are on hand as the guards who are passing the torch,so to speak,to Stiller.Van Dyke gives Stiller a tour of the facility,hands him some stapled notes and keys,then leaves.When midnight strikes all the exhibits come to life,in dioramas or standing displays,such as monkeys,lions,wooly mammoths,an Easter Island head,Teddy Roosevelt on a horse,a T-Rex skeleton who plays fetch the bone,and so many more.Stiller is gobsmacked and quits after the first night.As he walks out his son appears with his ex's boyfriend wanting a tour of the museum.Stiller gives him a rain check and decides to try the job one more night.It seems a golden tablet of a resting pharaoh there is  responsible for bringing everything to life.However the curator finds a few messes the next morning after his shift and sacks him.His son just happens to walk in to see what took place,and leaves crushed.Back home at night Stiller explains that it was all a misunderstanding,he has his job back and that he wants his son to accompany him to work that night.At midnight Stiller prepares his son for what is about to happen...but nothing does.He checks out the pharaohs room to find the tablet gone.Soon Stiller learns that the ex guards are in the process of stealing the museums greatest artifacts,including the gold tablet,and are going to fence them in order to pad their retirement income.Stiller leaps into action and succeeds in getting the entire exhibits-brought-to-life to assist him in capturing the guards.After an up and down battle the guards are caught and everything is returned to its normal spot.The guards are made to be janitors to get out of being arrested and the outside antics of some of the museums living displays got on the previous nights news and attendance has suddenly shot up,to the pleasant surprise of the curator.As I mentioned the film moves along at a good pace and there is little filler here to slow the film down.There are a lot of little neat moments such as Dexter the monkey's close encounters with Stiller,vis a' vis the slapping routine and the constant stealing of Stiller's keys.Teddy Roosevelt's presence(Williams) is a neat touch as he offers Stiller some good advice throughout.This movie will especially appeal to children and the children in all of us due to the myriad of creatures both ancient and new that walk the museum halls after midnight.Watch for Stiller's real life mother Ann Meara who makes a delightful appearance as the employment agent.Also it was an absolute joy seeing Mickey Rooney and Dick Van Dyke playing the security guards.They've still got it!Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1 :85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include only commentary.All in all a nice little distraction that will have the children in all of us in awe at what they see re-created on the screen.The movie has a decent pace to it,and while it is far from perfect,I did enjoy it.Recommended.",3,A decent comedy for the family.3 1/2-4 stars.,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,3729,"['Night', 'Museum', 'released', 'Dec/06', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Larry', 'Daley', 'Robin', 'Williams',

Ben Stiller plays the night guard at a Natural History Museum in which everything comes to life between sunset and sunrise.  In a sort of take off of ""Groundhog Day"" he learns to manage this nocturnal zoo better each night, until everything turns out right.The chemistry is mostly right between the actors, and Mickey Rooney (one of the three fired night guards whose jobs Stiller is taking) still has it.  The plot is pure Hollywood stock and utterly predictable--Stiller is ridiculed, his son more and more estranged from his divorced dad, etc., but everything clicks in the end.  There's a fair satisfaction for the viewer to draw from the movie anyway, and some laughs.  Indeed, the scene where Stiller breaks down Attila the Hun's fierce composure had my wife in hysterics.Somehow Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams) both contains the real Roosevelt's personality and memories but still knows he's a wax dummy.  Never mind.  He also has a thing for Sacagawea in the Lewis and Clark exhibit.  (By the way, it's ""Sakakawea."")  There's a scene in which he's cut in half but unharmed--he's wax, you know.

1059409,A3572FTYUQQW3P,B000NOKJBS,Royce Callaway,"[8, 22]","From the glowing reviews here, I guess I am in the minority. Essentially this was a 10 minute Ben Stiller schtick stuffed into a movie with the barest of plots. If you saw the trailer then you saw the movie because that is all there was -- just more of it. It was clever and fun at the beginning but quickly palled as it became repetitive.  The other actors were largely props with the exception of Robin Williams whose talents went totally unused.  Some of the reviewers have commented on how this movie shows how history can be fun.  What this movie had to do with history is beyond me because dressing people up in costumes does not represent history anymore than Halloween would.

The problem is Ben Stiller is so boring, and is yet to be blessed with a good script since Something About Mary.The special effects are at least enlightening, but can't carry the script.  What you saw in the movie trailer is about all you get.  Most of the jokes involving Owen Wilson as the miniature cowboy were used up again in the trailer.  Robin Williams makes a fun Teddy Roosevelt encouraging Larry the night watchman to bring out his best and save the day when all goes wrong.  But unfortunately, there are too many of these ""encouraging"" moments where the lights are turned down low and soft music is playing while someone speaks motivational words to instill something in kids.  Ben does it to his son on the ice during a hockey game, Teddy does it again and again to Larry (Ben), and there's even an awkward moment where Larry gets all Dr. Phil with Atilla the Hun.  Not funny.The best scene is where Larry the night watchman trades slaps with Dexter the Monkey which goes on and on and on, but really is funny.  Kudos to Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney as retiring watchman who turn out to be bad guys.  They were quite refreshing.

It's a great little family movie. Family values. Forging relationships. Right from wrong...it's all in there. All presented in a nice entertaining way as opposed to preaching.And, man, there's tons of stars: Dick Van Dyke, Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Mickey Rooney, Bill Cobbs, and of course today's big box office draw Ben Stiller.

Stiller and crew make an absolutly entertaining flick by doing what is so forgien to even animated films, staying away from social satire.NAM's best merits rely on how well it meshes everything together. The star studded cast of Stiller, Wilson, Williams etc play off each other so well, it's nice to see all of them together on a kid's movie. The story is no different than what's been promoted: Stiller spends his nights as a museum watch guard, trying to keep the exhibits from running wild. This is just one part of NAM's genius, the other is the history. Just as well as the actors play off eachother so do the exhibits. All the historical figures blend very cohesivly, reacting to each other like you think they would.Not only is NAM an extremely entertaining film, but I can also respect it for staying away from the social satire. Satire's been leaking into every movie genre, and you can't even look at animated films without seeing a directors political views.But as much as I respect NAM, it's a good film, but not great.

Rooney still has a lot of spunk for an oldster, evfen if his facial expressions leave something to be desired.  Still kicking, too, is Dick Van Dyke who is a long way from Diagnosis Murder!  There is also a black man rounding out the trio of museum security guards, which I thought was a nice concession to diversity.This is a family film that can be watched by church-going people.

Larry wants to impress his son for Career Day, so he gets a job as a night watchman at a historic museum only to discover that everything in the museum comes alive at night including President Teddy Roosevelt, played by Williams, an annoying little monkey named Dexter, wild animals of the African jungles, Attila the Hun, the cavemen, the miniature Romans led by Octavius and cowboys led by Jedidiah, played by an uncredited Owen Wilson, and a T-rex skeleton.The movie features veteran actors Van Dyke, Rooney, and Cobbs in roles of old timer watchmen who offer Larry the job, and who we later discover are scheming for something bad; these roles are so silly for men their age, that they could destroy what's left of their legacy. The film also features an unnecessary cameo appearance by Charlie Murphy, Eddie's brother and regular on the Dave Chappelle Show, as a taxi driver.Night at the Museum is a silly movie.

1059439,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000NOKJBS,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[1, 2]","This kind of film won't win any Oscars, some scenes are retreads of better films (Jumanji), and it is a rather unevenly paced film, but in spite of all that I highly recommend this fun film that is appropriate for the whole family and that is hard to say today.I saw this with my kids, ages 10 and 14, and they both, along with their dad, found numerous scenes and moments to enjoy.  It's wonderful to see some of my favorite actors from when I was a kid on screen again and doing what they do best.  I grew up loving Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney and these guys look darn good for being in their 80's.  Of course, Ben Stiller and Robin Williams are reliable as always and I'll take any excuse to see that ""Spy Kids"" mom, Carla Gugino, in anything.  She's a stunning woman who also brings great earnest to any performance she gives.  She is very underrated as an actress.This is the kind of movie you can see again and again and continue to laugh and enjoy.  Nothing great in here, no Oscar nominations are expected, but this is plain old-fashioned film making and it doesn't pretend to be anything beyond that; however, the themes of responsibility and growing up are handled nicely.  I just loved that line of encouragement by William's Roosevelt character to Stiller's who questions whether he is able to set anything right: ""I'm only made of wax.  What are you made of?""Oh, one more comment here.  I noticed in various several comment sections that someone noted that ""foul language has become family entertainment"" and ""No one cares about foul language anymore. Shame!""  I figured this person has to be kidding.  I can't even recall anything foul said in this film and it must have been extremely mild for me to not have noticed.  Sadly, lots of PG and PG-13 films directed at the ""family"" for entertainment have certainly increased the foul language ratio a bit, but to harp on that and others who have enjoyed the film with their kids is rather intolerant and excessive.  I would prefer that family movies have little or no foul language, but I'd be living on another planet to view such a film.  I just kind of accept where we are and try to make do.This is a simple family film and a clean one at that.

1059451,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000NOKJBS,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 6]","Larry (Ben Stiller), a divorced Dad with too many ideas and too little follow through to make any of them work, receives sobering news from his ex-wife, Erika (Kim Raver, TV's ""24"", ""The Nine""). Larry needs to get a job and provide a steady home for their son, Nick (Jake Cherry) to visit, he has moved around too much. Desperate, Larry takes a job as the new Night Security Guard at the New York Museum of Natural History. The outgoing guards (Dick Van Dyke, Bill Cobbs and Mickey Rooney) have worked there a long time and are reluctant to go. But Mr. McPhee (Ricky Gervais) is trying to save money and wants to replace the three guards who are about to retire with one new guard. Just before they leave, Cecil (Van Dyke) gives Larry a set of instructions and warns him ""Don't let anything in or out"". That evening, every display in the museum comes to life, including the Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton, dioramas, statues and stuffed animals. Even the statue of Theodore Roosevelt (Robin Williams) comes to life and offers Larry some assistance, explaining why this is happening. A gold tablet was discovered in Egypt in the 50s and was put on display over the mummy of Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek). From that point, the entire museum has come to life every night. Larry has a terrible time keeping things under control and just makes it through the night. The next morning, as he is about to quit, his son stops by for a tour. Larry has to keep the job, for his son. He decides to give it another try and begins to study, in an effort to combat the mayhem.""Night at the Museum"", directed by Shawn Levy (""Cheaper by the Dozen"", ""The Pink Panther"" (not two of my favorite films)) is a lot of fun. Filled with a lot of action, great special effects and a lot of good humor for young and old, ""Museum"" is possibly the best family film of the season.Levy is not one of my favorite directors. ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is a very bad film which is the visual equivalent of hearing someone scrape their fingernails across a chalkboard. ""The Pink Panther"" remake starring Steve Martin and Beyonce is better, but not by much and saying something is better than ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" isn't a great compliment. But in ""Museum"", Levy has done a great job of mixing the believable and fantastical, the comical and sweet. ""Museum"" has some problems, but they are not great and detract little from the overall feeling of the film.Stiller is actually quite sweet as devoted dad Larry. The only reason he takes the job in the first place is for his son; he would rather work on another invention than to work a night job at the Museum. Then, when all hell breaks loose, he is ready to quit, but stays on because of his son. During the evening, Roosevelt gives him some advice and Larry spends the next day studying all of the various bits of history involved, so he can be better prepared to control the museum. The second night, he returns with a backpack full of help, including a remote control car to drag a bone and keep the T Rex skeleton busy.Throughout the film, Larry interacts with the various characters who have come to life. Some of these speak English (which is explained by Akmenrah, he was formerly on display at Cambridge where he picked up the language) others don't, but Larry has to learn to communicate with them, in an effort to control the chaos.Owen Wilson plays Jedediah and Steve Coogan plays Octavius, two members of dioramas depicting the building of the railroad and the Roman Empire respectively, placed side by side. As each is interested in expansion, they frequently fight, trying to take over the other's territory. As the film progresses, Larry has to deal with them, becoming a peacemaker, and the three have some funny exchanges, providing a lot of humor. Many of their asides are geared at adults, making the film memorable for this demographic as well.Robin Williams is also very good as a life-size statue of Theodore Roosevelt. Very subdued (for Williams) and actually a little believable in the role, he imbues the character with a sense of adventure and a sense of purpose, as the real Roosevelt would undoubtedly demonstrate. As the story continues, Larry learns Roosevelt has a thing for Sacagawea (Mizuo Peck), but even though they come alive every evening, Roosevelt is unable to speak with her because her display is behind glass and they can't hear each other. Larry solves this by breaking the glass, but Roosevelt is too shy and has to be pushed harder. Then, when they finally meet, their relationship blooms and it is sweet to watch.Dick Van Dyke has the meatiest role he has had in years. I half expected him to provide a quick cameo at the beginning of the film and then disappear. But he, Bill Cobbs and Mickey Rooney prove more prominent characters in the story. They return a few times and help give them film a plot point. At one point, Van Dyke's character is running through the museum, doing a stunt fall. Even though it is clearly a stuntman doing the work, it is nice to see Van Dyke in such a pivotal role.Mickey Rooney is also funny as Gus, another member of the trio of old guards. He doesn't like Larry and hurls constant insults at the young man. Some of these are quite funny and it is nice to see the actor, one of the few remaining actors from Hollywood's Golden Age, showing he can still mix it up in a film.Ricky Gervais does a memorable turn as the Museum's stuffy director. From the moment he chastises an off-screen parent to control their children, you realize you are in for a treat. In further interactions with Larry, he clearly is a man with too many thoughts in his head that he can't express correctly. His character combines elements of the stuffed shirt administrator with the absent minded professor and this helps to make his dialogue and actions memorable.Paul Rudd has a brief and memorable role as the ex-wife's new husband. From the moment he appears on screen, his image elicits laughter.Carla Gugino plays Rebecca a docent at the museum who befriends Larry. The role is pretty forgettable and could be played by just about any actress. Kim Raver pays her actor's dues and takes on the thankless and forgettable role of Larry's ex-wife.Based on the previews, I expected the Tyrannosaurus Rex to make an appearance in the climax, but it is the first item Larry has to deal with when the Museum comes to life during his first night on the job. This is the first event and really makes a memorable way to kick off the festivities. The dinosaur skeleton doesn't just come to life, it has an amusing personality all its own.When this event occurs in the middle of the film, I was a little concerned that everything would go downhill, that they had just spent their creative juices on an early sequence. Miraculously, the film continues to surprise and move on from there. Terracotta statues, jade lions, a bronze sculpture of Christopher Columbus and wax figures of animals continue to come alive and make Larry's job interesting.It is a testament to the filmmakers that the action and mayhem continues to build from a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton coming to life, that this merely sets the tone for the remainder of the film.The film also sends a sweet message about parenthood. Larry eventually brings his son to the museum, in an effort to impress him. What little kid wouldn't like to see Christopher Columbus, Attila the Hun and other historical figures come to life? But, naturally, this is also the evening the main plot kicks into gear and they have to work together, along with Roosevelt, Jedediah, Octavius and all of the others to thwart the plot.What plot? You'll have to watch it to find out.Finally, after everything resolves, the Museum becomes a hot destination again and attendance skyrockets. Hopefully, this movie will have the same effect on similar institutions across the country.""Night at the Museum"" blends funny performances, great special effects, grown up humor and a sweet message to become the best family film of the season.",5,"4 1/2 - Fun, Exciting and Great for the Entire Family",1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,8012,"['Larry', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'divorced', 'Dad', 'too',

1059456,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000NOKJBS,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 8]","""Night at the Museum"" is director Shawn Levy's follow-up to his unoriginal remake of ""The Pink Panther,"" but thankfully the new film benefits from an array of great actors - Ben Stiller, Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, Bill Cobbs, Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney. One good thing is ""Night at the Museum"" lets these talented players show us what they can do. The film's script is disjointed, but when it allows the actors to bring their best tricks to the otherwise weak story, the film becomes very funny.If you have seen the trailer of the film, you know the story except the last 30 minutes. Ben Stiller is Larry, down-on-his-luck divorced father of a nice boy, who is employed as night watch at the museum, where he learns that the exhibitions there can really move. The first half of the film is at times dull, I am afraid, but wait for the chase-with-the-T-Rex sequences and the silly slap-fighting with a naughty monkey. They are silly but fun.Despite its several funny set-pieces, however, the film sometimes misses the chances to make us laugh more. The three veterans are wasted (their best scenes are in fact in the end credit, where they can be seen dancing to the music); the subplot about Robin William's `Teddy Roosevelt' is underwritten; and the role of Carla Gugino doesn't make much sense. As to the special effects, well, sorry, but I didn't see very special about them.After all ""Night at the Museum"" takes no risks and its Ben Stiller is much restrained, avoiding the raw and vulgar types of gags seen in ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.""

His professional career has been filled with failed enterprises and bankruptcies.  Despite having moved several times since his divorce, it is a lifestyle that he has enjoyed.  When he realizes, however, the instability in his life is restricting his relationship with his son, Jake (Nick Daley), he decides to get a job and stick with it.  A job agency is able to find him employment at the Museum of Natural History as the new night guard.  The museum is downsizing by replacing three old guards (Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Cobbs) with one new, young one.  Larry soon learns that the job wasn't as easy as he thought it would be because at night everything in the museum comes to life.NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM isn't a deep, moving, life-changing movie.  It really doesn't have a message to deliver and it doesn't break any new ground cinematically.  The film has a lot of special effects, but there are just as many old school camera tricks used as there is CGI.  In short, there might not be anything outstanding about the film, but NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM is a good, old fashioned action comedy.  It's a fun movie, i.e. the type of movie that people used to flock to theatres in droves to see.  The story moves along at a decent pace and doesn't drag and the plot has a couple of attention-grabbing twists.Ben Stiller has become a modern comic legend, but in NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM he shares the screen with others more experienced and seasoned veterans:  Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, Bill Cobbs, and Robin Williams.  Williams portrays Theodore Roosevelt and my opinion it's the best role he's had in years.  As for the three elder statesmen of the cast, it's just a pure joy seeing Van Dyke, Rooney, and Cobbs working so well together on screen.I really enjoyed NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM.

I think the bad rap is coming from those who are rating it like an adult film.  Get a life; it's for kids.  The audience around me had quite a few children who were laughing out loud all the way through it.  It's like an animated feature that's come to life with its own all-star cast to do the voices.  But Night at the Museum is for grown up kids as well--like the ones who felt guilty about choosing one toy over another to play with because you didn't want to hurt the other toy's feelings.  (You know who you are.)  It makes fun of pretentious adults, points out that mistakes can be fixed if you work hard enough, and that imagination is not just a word.  I loved it because it reminded me that I once thought that anything was possible--and maybe still is.  Normally Ben Stiller is not my favorite actor but I have to admit, he sold me on this one.  I was also impressed with the presence and subtlety of Mizuo Peck, who plays Sakajawea. (She really needs a press agent--there is almost no information about her anywhere.)  Night at the Museum is a fantasy in every sense; it is often implausable but always fun.  In addition to Ms. Peck, all the familiar faces deliver the goods with joyful abandon, including the octogenarians, especially Micky Rooney.  Even if it bombs at the box office, it will sell a ton of DVDs for sleepovers and guilty pleasures of grown-ups who need to retrieve that sad little toy they left behind.

With a budget of $110 million, Night at the Museum sounds like it should be an action/adventure movie of some kind. And for many of the sequences it is, in fact.Ben Stiller drives the film along with his family-friendly comedy schtick that is accessible to all ages, from the youngest to the oldest that could be watching this film. He's got an endearing everyman vibe about him that keeps the grandiose action and CGI grounded in comedy and entertainment.The supporting cast is stellar, including Ricky Gervais, Owen Wilson, Robin Williams, Steve Coogan, and Paul Rudd in a hilarious cameo as a nerdy stepdad. Everyone delivers the laughs in their scenes.The CGI is amazing to look at, with a giant fossilized T-Rex running wild, numerous animals, and people from every culture (from cavemen to the wild west), including a bronzed statue of Christopher Columbus.Overall Night at the Museum is the rare kind of epic comedy that actually delivers on expectations on all accounts, and even manages to throw in a few surprises. It also does it all without a fart joke, a kick-in-the-nuts joke, or any other overrated comedic bit.The DVD doesn't include any special features, but I guess that's what the 2 disc set is for, but you don't really need special features when the feature itself is this entertaining. Don't miss it.",4,Night at the Museum provides a night of laughter,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,1410,"['got', 'be', 'one', 'largest', 'not', 'largest', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'time', 'budget', '110', 'million', 'Night', 'Museum', 'should', 'be', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'kind', 'many', 'sequences', 'fact.Ben', 'Stiller', 'film', 'family-friendly', 'comedy', 'schtick', 'accessible', 'ages', 'youngest', 'oldest', 'could', 'be', 'watching', 'film', 'got', 'endearing', 'everyman', 'vibe', 'grandiose', 'action', 'CGI', 'grounded', 'comedy', 'entertainment.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'stellar', 'including', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'nerdy', 'stepdad', 'Everyone', 'laughs', 'scenes.The', 'CGI', 'amazing', 'look', 'giant', 'fossilized', 'T-Rex', 'running', 'wild', 'numerous', 'animals', 'people', 'culture', 'cavemen', 'wild', 'west', 'including', 'bronzed', 'statue', 'Christopher', 'Columbus.Overall', 'Night', 'Museum', 'rare', 'kind', 'epic', 'comedy', 'actually', 'expectations', 'accounts', 'even', 'manages', 'throw', 'few', 'surprises', 'also', 'fart', 'joke', 'kick-in-the-nuts', 'joke', 'other', 'overrated', 'comedic', 'bit.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'include', 'special', 'features', 'guess', 'what', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'special', 'features', 'when', 'feature', 'entertaining', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss']",N/A
