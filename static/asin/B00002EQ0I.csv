514842,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00002EQ0I,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[4, 4]","In the wake of Columbine, this film, originally titled ""Killing Mrs. Tingle"", was changed to ""Teaching Mrs. Tingle"". I think it sounds more appropriate. To tell you the truth, this movie isn't as bad as has been written about it. Writer Kevin Williamson is on board as director as well on this film. Three students decide to take action against a nasty teacher(brilliantly played By Helen Mirren)who thinks they were cheating on a test(which they weren't)and now stands in their way of graduating. They go to her house and a series of incidents occur which now has the three students keeping Mrs. Tingle locked up in her house, with each one of them taking turns watching her. One by one, Mrs. Tingle begins to mess with their minds. Helen Mirren is exceptionally convincing and brilliant as the nasty teacher. She will have you hooked on her through the entire film. The other stars, Katie(Dawson's Creek)Holmes, Barry(7th Heaven)Watson, and newcomer Marissa Coughlan are all pretty good. Coughlan is especially delightful. Many bad things were said about this film because of Columbine and the violence in the movie, but there is no deaths. No nothing. I think a lot of people ripped into it because of what the original title was and because of Columbine. It's obvious that they never even saw the film or read the script. It's PG-13 after all. This isn't grand filmmaking, but it's entertaining to a certain degree nonetheless. Williamson has a nice eye for directing as well. The film was loosely based on Williamson's own bad teacher. And, I think, we've all had a Mrs. Tingle.

This movie looks like a training ground for ""9 to 5"" (1980).Helen Mirren is the perfect Mrs. Tingle; she has that look that can see through your sole and divulge your deepest fears. That same year she played Ayn Rand in Passion of Ayn Rand, The (1999). However most people remember her as Supt. Jane Tennison in ""Prime Suspect.""Michael McKean made a perfect principal and you can tell he was sweating on his early encounter with Mrs. Tingle. Remember him in ""Laverne & Shirley"" (1976) TV Series as Lenny Kosnowski (1976-1982)?Then there is the quick appearance of Molly Ringwald as Miss Banks. She brings back memories of ""Sixteen Candles"" (1984), when she was the teenager.If this movie looks predictable or the people's thoughts are transparent, that is the design. Now the viewer can say don't do that or oh no will they really do that? And you can see eyes narrow as the mind is plotting!The only real disappointment was the rather arrownious ending.

Helen Mirren is too good an actress for this role,  but she ultimately saves the movie.

She's also quite the beauty, still hot in her ""older"" years! Watching Ms. Mirren match wits w/ her teen abductors (including a nice turn by Katie Holmes) is a pure joy! She is smart, acidic, and downright eeevil! Her Mrs. Tingle is frightening, even when bound and gagged! You can feel her hate, while watching those wicked wheels turn in her head. TEACHING MRS. TINGLE is a surprisingly intelligent and suspenseful movie. It uses its humor sparingly, never making things ridiculous. Kevin Williamson (Scream 1 and 2) deserves a lot of credit here. He uses restraint, going with a more sinister tone, when things could really have taken a much sillier turn. The only complaint I have is the PG-13 rated version. It's obvious by the ""EXORCIST re-enactment"" scene that words were overdubbed to miss the R rating. It sort of wrecks an otherwise hilarious sequence.

It's not a great movie, but it's fun, smart and sassy and it has enough going for it to overshadow it's faults.  The story follows Leanne (Holmes) as she struggles to make valedictorian so she can get her scholarship and get out of the small town rut she finds herself.  The only problem is her history teacher Mrs. Tingle (Mirren) who fancies herself at ruining Leanne's life.  When she accuses Leanne of cheating of her history final things spiral out of control and Leanne, along with her boisterous, somewhat ditzy friend Jo Lynn (Coughlin) and the school pretty boy/bad boy Luke (Watson) take matters into their own hands by kidnapping Tingle.

With a prize schoolar ship at risk,  Katie attempts to prove that she is innocent of the crime. Mrs. Tingle will  have none of this, as it is blatantly obvious that she is, above all, pure  evil. One event leads to another, and our precious students tie Tingle to  her bed and slowly force her to listen to them, while Tingle is slowly  pyschologicly tearing the group apart, planning her  freedom..............Simply by a glance at the cover of the film and it  becomes apparent that &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot; is targeted toward  teens. Add the fact that it is directed by (ugh) Kevin willimason and  features such popular teen stars; adults might dislike this film. The  various reasons why this movie was passible are;1) Was it entirely  nessessary to shoot Tingle with a cross-bow? Would it not be smarter to  reason with the principal or someone else that has communicated with Mrs.  Tingle, as everyone who knows her hates her?2) Helen Mirren gives off a  fantastic preformance as the evil teacher, but her physical strengh is  unbeleviable. She punches, crushes, and strangles all the students who get  in her way.3) Helen Mirren stays tied to the bed post for the entire  movie.4) The students are so dim that they acually confide their  personal secrets to Tingle, and she uses the information to manipulate  them.5) The use of the word &quot;Ironic&quot;.6) The plot is  somewhat weak, mostly involving the students madely scrambling to keep the  kidnapping secret; just add a little weak humor, sex, and violence.7) At  one point Tingle is smashing a certain student around, spaltering them is  blood. Tingle acually gets pushed down the stairs and all of the blood  dissapears. I doubt that one is healed from falling down stairs...8) The  ending. Holmes sleeps with Watson, who is Coughlin's crush. This breaks the  bond of friendship between Holmes and Coughlin, yet the group are seen  walking together during ther ending, in a cheery sort of mood.

If she does, she will be able to escape the town.  The only thing that stands in her way is an evil history teacher.  But when she is almost framed for cheating the history teacher becomes and even bigger obstacle as she seems to thrill in the idea of destroying on of the school's best students.When an appeal to Mrs. Tingle fails an accident lands them in deeper trouble that results in them holding the teacher in captivity.  But even tied down her evil can spread as she tries to split apart the friends and gain her freedom.  But everything the students do seems to make matters even more hopeless.  But a few lucky breaks might give them a chance against Mrs. Tingle.A little bit of humor and situations that keep the characters getting deeper and deeper into trouble is only half of what drives this movie.  the other half is Helen Mirren and her portrayal of the evil teacher.

514881,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,B00002EQ0I,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[5, 6]","While attempting to pound out reviews on Straw Dogs and Santa Sangre, a friend of mine lent me Teaching Mrs. Tingle which in comparison felt as light and fluffy as a down comforter. Here I was sweating bullets over two agonizingly lofty and intense pictures that require near perfection before a review could be deemed worthy of appearing in a public arena, and now I had at my fingertips a subject that I could easily discribe in simplistic terms of what works and what does not, needless to say, I decided to give my limited brain cells a rest and leave those two monstrosities in a couple of chaotic piles on the back burner.Teaching Mrs. Tingle is a comedy that bases its humor on the familiar comedic elements of paying off long running gags, and exaggerating normality. Kattie Holmes has a long running gag about not getting the meaning of the word ""ironic"" right untill the closing moments of the film when she pays off the gag by teaching Mrs. Tingle what irony feels like, not that this gag is particularly funny but it does give the story a conveniently contrived conclusion. Marisa Coughlan's long running gag is that Mrs. Tingle can see right through all her acting attempts which is her characters life ambition, this gag also pays off at the conclusion of the film in a similarly contrived manner when she finally fools Mrs. Tingle with her acting ability. The problem is that this film has long since lost any of its funniness due to several plot twists that end up turning this comedy into a psycho thriller.The best thing about Teaching Mrs. Tingle is Mrs. Tingle. The stylistic choice to exaggerate her character into the evilest teacher in the history of high schools is by far the most engrossing element in the whole film. Helen Mirren plays Mrs. Tingle, a role that recalls her days as Morgana in John Boormans Excalibur. Like Excalibur she is pretty much playing a mythological character, quite possibly Medusa. Her first introduction to the viewer is from the neck down as she briskly walks through the center of campus hallway in her severely buttoned down dark bussiness suit which looks like the attire of a modern day wicked witch. In a scene reminiscent of the running of the bulls in Pamplona Spain, or the parting of the Red Sea, the students and faculty members alike scatter from her path in total fright in a nice build up her insurmountably evil persona. Later in class she destroys her students ridiculously elaborite assignments and shakey psyches with her razor sharp mind and acid tongue as she floats in front of her students like some manevolent crocodile salivating for the next tender morsel to expose its weakness to her.Playing the role of a sinister beast as opposed to just another straight person already places Helen Mirren at a huge advantage for stealing the attention away from the rest of the cast, but this disparity is all the more magnified by her incredibly powerful film presence which dwarfs the acting ability of her youthful counterparts. It is also interesting to notice the degree in which she separates herself from her hot young co-stars in the area of sex appeal. This is no small feat concidering that she was 53 during the filming of this movie, and is basicly playing a monster. Yet dispite these character and age drawbacks, and dispite not taking part in the films love triangle she still grossly overpowers her nubile co-stars with her sultry sensuality.The real problem with this movie is that writer director Kevin Williamson made a poor choice to tie the films best feature to a bedpost and leave her there motionless for most of the film. To fill in the missing action, the story had to slither into its side stories which unfortunately revolve around tedious adolescent dramas. I guess he made a choice to do a humorous parody on the Exorcist, yet this very choice placed the film on an endless downward trajectory, it peters out, flatlines, and once it does it never recovers. It creates an maddening film experiance in that it starts off so promising only to lose all its bubbles and go flat. By the end of the film I no longer felt like I was watching something funny, in fact, while watching two of the principle characters violently tumble down a flight of stairs in slow motion, I was suddenly reminded of my review of Straw Dogs which I placed aside because of the scary feelings it gave me. Somehow I do not associate seeing a painful Peckenpah like action sequence with a fun highschool comedy, and I can't help feeling like Kevin Williamson wanted to do far too much with this idea and in the process made it so that none of it worked.Ultimately this film might make an okay rentail if you are really really bored and have nothing better that you want to do, but ownership is out of the question, dispite how nice it was to see Helen Mirren play such a dynamic character. In keeping with the theme of irony, the true irony is that the choice to make a comedic Exorcist homage at all cost is ultimately what killed all the fun, now thats ironic.",3,"""Paging Mrs.

514884,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00002EQ0I,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Teaching Mrs. Tingle (Kevin Williamson, 1999)I avoided this film for years despite my fanboyish obsession with Helen Mirren simply because it was written and directed by the awful Kevin Williamson. I finally decided to get around to seeing it, and I discovered, much to my surprise, that Kevin Williamson is not really all that awful. (I am now faced with the idea that Craven and Williamson's collaborations are bad because of Craven and not Williamson, which is a truly depressing idea.) Teaching Mrs. Tingle is at least smart and funny, if predictable and cliched.Eve Tingle (Mirren) is the history teacher from hell, a tyrant whose class is the one that keeps just about everyone from getting uniformly good grades. Thanks to a series of events that could only happen in Hollywood, good girl Leigh Ann Watson (Dawson's Creek's Katie Holmes) is discovered with the answers to Mrs. Tingle's final exam in her bag. With her best friend Jo Lynn (Pumpkin's Marisa Coughlan) and Luke (Seventh Heaven's Barry Watson), who was responsible for the whole mess in the first place, Leigh Ann goes over to Mrs. Tingle's house to plead her case. Things spiral out of control, and the three teens find themselves locked in a battle of wits with the teacher.There has been a great deal made over the title's changing from Killing Mrs. Tingle being thanks to Columbine; did no one notice the incredible similarities to the 1997 TV movie Killing Mr. Griffin? Eh, guess not. In any case, you get pretty much what you came for. Jo Lynn is all too stereotypical. Luke is a tad more three-dimensional, but of the three teens, only Leigh Ann is drawn with anything akin to depth. Eve Tingle is the movie's best creation, but much of her depth is shown to the viewer and then made to disappear.Despite the movie's weak characterization and derivative plot, it is at least amusing and decently-paced, which accounts for some of its watchability. You won't find classic film here, by any means, but not a bad way to kill an hour and a half or so if you enjoy staring rapturously at Helen Mirren. ** ",3,"Amusing, but doesn't quite live upto its potential.",1147910400,"05 18, 2006",2006,2077,"['Teaching', 'Mrs.', 'Tingle', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', '1999', 'avoided', 'film', 'years', 'fanboyish', 'obsession', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'simply', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'awful', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'finally', 'decided', 'get', 'seeing', 'discovered', 'much', 'surprise', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'not', 'really', 'awful', 'am', 'now', 'faced', 'idea', 'Craven', 'Williamson', 'collaborations', 'are', 'bad', 'Craven', 'not', 'Williamson', 'truly', 'depressing', 'idea', 'Teaching', 'Mrs.', 'Tingle', 'least', 'smart', 'funny', 'predictable', 'cliched.Eve', 'Tingle', 'Mirren', 'history', 'teacher', 'hell', 'tyrant', 'class', 'one', 'just', 'everyone', 'getting', 'uniformly', 'good', 'grades', 'Thanks', 'series', 'events', 'could', 'only', 'happen', 'Hollywood', 'good', 'girl', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'Watson', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'discovered', 'answers', 'Mrs.', 'Tingle', 'final', 'exam', 'bag', 'best', 'friend', 'Jo', 'Lynn', 'Pumpkin', 'Marisa', 'Coughlan', 'Luke', 'Seventh', 'Heaven', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'whole', 'mess', 'first', 'place', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'Mrs.', 'Tingle', 'house', 'plead', 'case', 'Things', 'spiral', 'control', 'three', 'teens', 'find', 'locked', 'battle', 'wits', 'teacher.There', 'been', 'great', 'deal', 'made', 'title', 'changing', 'Killing', 'Mrs.', 'Tingle', 'being', 'thanks', 'Columbine', 'did', 'one', 'incredible', 'similarities', '1997', 'TV', 'movie', 'Killing', 'Mr.', 'Griffin', 'Eh', 'guess', 'not', 'case', 'get', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'came', 'Jo', 'Lynn', 'too', 'stereotypical', 'Luke', 'tad', 'more', 'three-dimensional', 'three', 'teens', 'only', 'Leigh', 'Ann', 'drawn', 'anything', 'akin', 'depth', 'Eve', 'Tingle', 'movie', 'best', 'creation', 'much', 'depth', 'shown', 'viewer', 'then', 'made', 'disappear.Despite', 'movie', 'weak', 'characterization', 'derivative', 'plot', 'least', 'amusing', 'decently-paced', 'watchability', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'classic', 'film', 'here', 'means', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'kill', 'hour', 'half', 'so', 'enjoy', 'staring', 'rapturously', 'Helen', 'Mirren', '**']",Teaching Mrs Tingle VHS

Mrs. Tingle is the teacher (the fortunate among us only had one) we all hated in high school--a  bitter, arrogant, pedantic horror who hated the students entrusted to her  care.  She delights not in teaching but in assuring the students that they  are hopelessly ignorant and far, far beneath her.  She is equally hateful  to adults who don't immediately fall in sync with her plans, as when she  blackmails the principal of the school by reminding him that she knows he  is a four-year veteran of Alcoholics Anonymous.  Mirren makes you hate her  character most sincerely in her very first scenes in the movie and gives  you more and more reasons to do so as the film progresses.  She is the most  deliciously evil villian to appear on film in years.  The young actors in  the film rise to the occasion admirably, as well.  At times Coughlin's  performance comes dangerously close to being too campy, but overall it is  completely consistent with another character you probably knew in high  school--the member of the dramatics club who knew she was destined to be a  big star before she ever auditioned for a professional director.  It is she  who encourages the trio of students to persist with the drama of keeping  Ms. Tingle hostage while attempting to persuade her to &quot;listen to  reason&quot;.The main characters might have become broad-stroke  caricatures without the deft writing and direction that gives them a truly  human side.  Mirren is wicked, but you have to admire her intelligence and  craftiness.  Holmes is wholesome and innocent as charged, but not so  innocent that she can't participate in a hostage-taking plot to achieve her  goals nor too wholesome to continue refusing Watson's romantic advances.  Coughlin shows the cunning and instinctive intelligence that can often be  hidden by the facade of an &quot;airhead blonde&quot;.  Watson shows that  the high school rebel, with or without a cause, can do great, if illegal,  things once given a sense of direction--making you think that pointing such  youth in the right direction might not be a waste of time, after all.The  real fun of this movie is the building suspense as Tingle and her students  play a war of wits and nerve.  Mirren is truly amazing as she controls  minds and action while helplessly (?) tied to her bedposts throughout most  of the film.  Further, you can enjoy the suspense, which becomes quite  nerve-racking at times, because there is no real gore and violence to spoil  the fun--some hand-to-hand combat, yes, with normal resulting wounds, but  nothing that  exposes internal organs or even results in blood splatter.  And in the finest tradition of good suspense films, just when your nerves  can't take any more of the sinister stuff, there are moments of comic  relief that are just as tasty.  Kevin Williamson is to be highly commended  for his skillful direction of this treat.This film has some capital  performances, the sort that take you back to the good old days when  successful suspense films relied on the talent of actors and a good  director rather than exclusively on gore, crash scenes and special effects.  Nice to know it can still be done.  We have missed it.",5,"Capital Entertainment, Suspense of the Best Kind",950832000,"02 18, 2000",2000,3309,"['Helen', 'Mirren', 'definitely', 'show', 'film', 'performance', 'gem', 'properly', 'set', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Mrs.', 'Tingle', 'teacher', 'fortunate', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'hated', 'high', 'school', 'bitter', 'arrogant', 'pedantic', 'horror', 'who', 'hated', 'students', 'entrusted', 'care', 'not', 'teaching', 'assuring', 'students', 'are', 'hopelessly', 'ignorant', 'far', 'far', 'equally', 'hateful', 'adults', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'fall', 'sync', 'plans', 'when', 'principal', 'school', 'reminding', 'four-year', 'veteran', 'Alcoholics', 'Anonymous', 'Mirren', 'hate', 'character', 'most', 'sincerely', 'very', 'first', 'scenes', 'movie', 'more', 'more', 'reasons', 'do', 'so', 'film', 'most', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'villian', 'appear', 'film', 'years', 'young', 'actors', 'film', 'rise', 'occasion', 'admirably', 'well', 'times', 'Coughlin', 'performance', 'dangerously', 'close', 'being', 'too', 'campy', 'overall', 'completely', 'consistent', 'character', 'probably', 'knew', 'high', 'school', 'member', 'dramatics', 'club', 'who', 'knew', 'was', 'destined', 'be', 'big', 'star', 'ever', 'auditioned', 'professional', 'director', 'who', 'trio', 'students', 'persist', 'drama', 'keeping', 'Ms.', 'Tingle', 'hostage', 'attempting', 'persuade', 'quot', 'listen', 'reason', 'quot', 'main', 'characters', 'might', 'have', 'become', 'broad-stroke', 'caricatures', 'deft', 'writing', 'direction', 'truly', 'human', 'side', 'Mirren', 'wicked', 'have', 'admire', 'intelligence', 'craftiness', 'Holmes', 'wholesome', 'innocent', 'charged', 'not', 'so', 'innocent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'participate', 'hostage-taking', 'plot', 'achieve', 'goals', 'too', 'wholesome', 'continue', 'refusing', 'Watson', 'romantic', 'advances', 'Coughlin', 'cunning', 'instinctive', 'intelligence', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'hidden', 'facade', 'quot', 'blonde', 'quot', 'Watson', 'high', 'school', 'rebel', 'cause', 'can', 'do', 'great', 'illegal', 'things', 'once', 'given', 'sense', 'direction', 'making', 'think', 'pointing', 'such', 'youth', 'right', 'direction', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'all.The', 'real', 'fun', 'movie', 'building', 'suspense', 'Tingle', 'students', 'play', 'war', 'wits', 'nerve', 'Mirren', 'truly', 'amazing', 'minds', 'action', 'helplessly', 'tied', 'bedposts', 'most', 'film', 'Further', 'can', 'enjoy', 'suspense', 'quite', 'nerve-racking', 'times', 'real', 'gore', 'violence', 'spoil', 'fun', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'yes', 'normal', 'resulting', 'wounds', 'nothing', 'internal', 'organs', 'even', 'results', 'blood', 'splatter', 'finest', 'tradition', 'good', 'suspense', 'films', 'just', 'when', 'nerves', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'more', 'sinister', 'stuff', 'are', 'moments', 'comic', 'relief', 'are', 'just', 'tasty', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'be', 'highly', 'commended', 'skillful', 'direction', 'treat.This', 'film', 'capital', 'performances', 'sort', 'take', 'back', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'successful', 'suspense', 'films', 'relied', 'talent', 'actors', 'good', 'director', 'rather', 'exclusively', 'gore', 'crash', 'scenes', 'special', 'effects', 'Nice', 'know', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'done', 'have', 'missed']",Teaching Mrs Tingle VHS
