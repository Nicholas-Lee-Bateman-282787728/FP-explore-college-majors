Nathaniel Parker's Inspector Thomas Lynley and Sharon Small's Barbara Havers are certainly the finest duo to come along in ages.The Inspector Lynley series is smart and atmospheric, Debbie Wiseman's opening music setting the tone for each intriguing installment. Based on Elizabeth George's characters, the BBC show has grown and matured beyond the books, which has frustrated some yet delighted others. The dashing Lynley was originally paired with Havers because it was taken for granted he would not be distracted by her in a romantic way. He was Oxford and she was from the other side of life.The clashes that came in the first two seasons due to those differences became less important as the two quickly found there was more to each other than their reputations. They proved a great team and became quite close, their deep friendship and affection for each other rarely dwelled upon but always there beneath the surface. By season three when personal crisis hit both of them hard it was each other to which they clung.Havers has softened some over time and Lynley has become more accessible, both due to the influence of the other. Parker and Small are fabulous in their roles, giving carefully nuanced performances in mysteries both intelligent and entertaining. If not for PBS and its ""Mystery"" this marvelous British series might not have garnered so many fans.Those wanting to either catch up with what has transpired before season five, or just enjoy once again at their leisure this fine mystery series will be well-advised to get this set. It includes all those episodes from the first four seasons as shown on PBS in America. Those episodes are as follows:SEASON ONE /  Well-Schooled in Murder --- Payment in Blood --- For the Sake of Elena --- Missing Joseph  SEASON TWO /  Playing for the Ashes --- In the Presence of the Enemy --- A Suitable Vengeance --- Deception on His Mind  SEASON THREE /  In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner --- A Traitor to Memory --- A Cry for Justice --- If Wishes Were Horses  SEASON FOUR /  In Divine Proportion --- In the Guise of Death --- The Seed of Cunning --- The Word of GodFans of quality television and especially mystery lovers will find a bonanza in these 16 installments starring Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small as Lynley and Havers. Fans truly cherish this show as much as Lynley does his cars. Hopefully we have not seen the last of our favorite British detectives and can once again look forward to ""Mystery"" knowing at some point we can enjoy their company once again.",5,If Wishes Were Horses,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,2747,"['crying', 'shame', 'what', 'truly', 'believe', 'finest', 'show', 'television', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'going', 'forward', 'campaign', 'being', 'waged', 'fans', 'PBS', 'Mystery', 'persuade', 'BBC', 'keep', 'producing', 'successful', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'Inspector', 'Thomas', 'Lynley', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'Barbara', 'Havers', 'are', 'certainly', 'finest', 'duo', 'come', 'along', 'ages.The', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'series', 'smart', 'atmospheric', 'Debbie', 'Wiseman', 'opening', 'music', 'setting', 'tone', 'intriguing', 'installment', 'Based', 'Elizabeth', 'George', 'characters', 'BBC', 'show', 'grown', 'matured', 'books', 'frustrated', 'yet', 'delighted', 'others', 'dashing', 'Lynley', 'was', 'originally', 'paired', 'Havers', 'was', 'taken', 'granted', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'distracted', 'romantic', 'way', 'was', 'Oxford', 'was', 'other', 'side', 'life.The', 'clashes', 'came', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'due', 'differences', 'became', 'less', 'important', 'two', 'quickly', 'found', 'was', 'more', 'other', 'reputations', 'proved', 'great', 'team', 'became', 'quite', 'close', 'deep', 'friendship', 'affection', 'other', 'rarely', 'dwelled', 'upon', 'always', 'surface', 'season', 'three', 'when', 'personal', 'crisis', 'hit', 'hard', 'was', 'other', 'clung.Havers', 'softened', 'time', 'Lynley', 'become', 'more', 'accessible', 'due', 'influence', 'other', 'Parker', 'Small', 'are', 'fabulous', 'roles', 'giving', 'carefully', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'mysteries', 'intelligent', 'entertaining', 'not', 'PBS', 'Mystery', 'marvelous', 'British', 'series', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'garnered', 'so', 'many', 'fans.Those', 'wanting', 'catch', 'up', 'what', 'transpired', 'season', 'five', 'just', 'enjoy', 'once', 'again', 'leisure', 'fine', 'mystery', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'well-advised', 'get', 'set', 'episodes', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'shown', 'PBS', 'America', 'episodes', 'are', 'SEASON', 'ONE', '/', 'Well-Schooled', 'Murder', 'Payment', 'Blood', 'Sake', 'Elena', 'Missing', 'Joseph', 'SEASON', 'TWO', '/', 'Playing', 'Ashes', 'Presence', 'Enemy', 'Suitable', 'Vengeance', 'Deception', 'Mind', 'SEASON', 'THREE', '/', 'Pursuit', 'Proper', 'Sinner', 'Traitor', 'Memory', 'Cry', 'Justice', 'Wishes', 'Were', 'Horses', 'SEASON', 'FOUR', '/', 'Divine', 'Proportion', 'Guise', 'Death', 'Seed', 'Cunning', 'Word', 'GodFans', 'quality', 'television', 'especially', 'mystery', 'lovers', 'will', 'find', 'bonanza', '16', 'installments', 'starring', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'Fans', 'truly', 'cherish', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'Lynley', 'cars', 'Hopefully', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'last', 'favorite', 'British', 'detectives', 'can', 'once', 'again', 'look', 'forward', 'Mystery', 'knowing', 'point', 'can', 'enjoy', 'company', 'once', 'again']","The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Series1-4"

1014607,AWNFFBJ6J1PSW,B000HEWH0A,Robert,"[8, 8]","The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Vol. 1-4British murder mysteries are considered by most to be the most sophisticated, and the Inspector Lynley mysteries are second only to Midsomer Murders in quality.  The acting by Nathanial Parker (Lynley) and Sharon Small (Havers) is convincing and their intereactions with each other consistently provide a secondary but interesting subplot within the main mystery.  The only tiresome part of this series involves the trial and tribulations created by Havers demented mother who is as annoying as she is unlikeable.  What realism and character development this might provide is offset by the distraction.  Fortunately, this sideshow diminishes in importance with each episode.  And each episode is outstanding with enough clues provided to help give the viewer a fighting chance to solve the crime, but enough false clues to make it difficult (and for this reviewer, almost always impossible).  The end result is that you can watch these episodes 3 or 4 times and catch nuances that were missed the first time, and enjoy the acting, which is consistently excellent.  If you like Midsomer Murders, you will like these mysteries as well.  And these are a much better deal.",5,Complex mysteries that are consistently excellent,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,1208,"['Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries', 'Vol', '1-4British', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'are', 'considered', 'most', 'be', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'mysteries', 'are', 'second', 'only', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'quality', 'acting', 'Nathanial', 'Parker', 'Lynley', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'Havers', 'convincing', 'intereactions', 'other', 'consistently', 'provide', 'secondary', 'interesting', 'subplot', 'main', 'mystery', 'only', 'tiresome', 'part', 'series', 'trial', 'tribulations', 'created', 'Havers', 'demented', 'mother', 'who', 'as', 'annoying', 'unlikeable', 'What', 'realism', 'character', 'development', 'might', 'provide', 'offset', 'distraction', 'Fortunately', 'sideshow', 'importance', 'episode', 'episode', 'outstanding', 'enough', 'clues', 'provided', 'help', 'give', 'viewer', 'fighting', 'chance', 'solve', 'crime', 'enough', 'false', 'clues', 'make', 'difficult', 'reviewer', 'almost', 'always', 'impossible', 'end', 'result', 'can', 'watch', 'episodes', '3', '4', 'times', 'catch', 'nuances', 'were', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'consistently', 'excellent', 'like', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'will', 'like', 'mysteries', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'deal']","The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Series1-4"
1014608,A2XSGDB4CWSS5J,B000HEWH0A,ShellBear,"[3, 4]","I've been a long time fan of the good inspector and the Inspector Lynley Mysteries are a cut above the rest, because it really concentrates on the complex relationship between Lynley and Havers.  It's not just who dunnit, but more about how Lynley and Havers go about solving it that makes it compelling  viewing.This dvd set, with 17 dvds ( including a Great Deliverance) is like a  big box of chocolates -  watching it is an absolute treat.  If you watch in order, you can see how their relationship evolves from their first reluctant pairing to the genuine friendship that develops.The acting is  sublime - Nathaniel Parker really shows Lynley to be a complex character ( as is the protagonist in Elizabeth George's books) and he captures Lynley's emotions well.  Lynley is unlike other British detectives who seem fairly one dimensional and rather wooden. Sharon Small is also outstanding as Havers  - from the ugly duckling  early days to the assured, s  strong character she becomes.  Both characters seem very real, again, unlike other detective series and to get these two fine British actors sparring off each other for over 25 hours is television heaven.All in all, a great DVD collection to own.  Bring on Series 5 and 6 please!",5,The Best Crime Fighting Duo on the screen,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,1239,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'good', 'inspector', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries', 'are', 'cut', 'rest', 'really', 'complex', 'relationship', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'not', 'just', 'who', 'dunnit', 'more', 'how', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'go', 'solving', 'compelling', 'viewing.This', 'dvd', 'set', '17', 'dvds', 'including', 'Great', 'Deliverance', 'big', 'box', 'chocolates', 'watching', 'absolute', 'treat', 'watch', 'order', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'relationship', 'evolves', 'first', 'reluctant', 'pairing', 'genuine', 'friendship', 'develops.The', 'acting', 'sublime', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'really', 'Lynley', 'be', 'complex', 'character', 'protagonist', 'Elizabeth', 'George', 'books', 'Lynley', 'emotions', 'well', 'Lynley', 'other', 'British', 'detectives', 'who', 'seem', 'fairly', 'one', 'dimensional', 'rather', 'wooden', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'also', 'outstanding', 'Havers', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'early', 'days', 'assured', 's', 'strong', 'character', 'characters', 'seem', 'very', 'real', 'again', 'other', 'detective', 'series', 'get', 'two', 'fine', 'British', 'actors', 'sparring', 'off', 'other', '25', 'hours', 'television', 'heaven.All', 'great', 'DVD', 'collection', 'own', 'Bring', 'Series', '5', '6', 'please']","The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Series1-4"
