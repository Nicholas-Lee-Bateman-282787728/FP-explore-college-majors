In all of the saw movies I've never seen the same thing done twice.

In this saw movie a lot of twist and turns happen and finally there are endings to stuff that happened in the other movies. I have been a fan of the saw series for a number of years but saw 3 was a huge letdown so I felt it was key that they had a great movie here. In terms of the types of killings I liked them a lot better than the last movie. The opening scene was sick as one of the guys had his eyes sowed shut and the other had his mouth sowed shut. It drove them both to insanity and the guy with his mouth sowed shut killed the other guy. In another guy who had been molesting women was strapped to a bed and he had to feel there pain and all his body parts were detached. I think saw 2 had better plots but this one was the second best. As you see just because jigsaw died doesn't mean the saw series is over by any stretch in fact I would not be surprised if we see a total of ten of them because they always drag in money and have a such a low budget. I would recommend saw 4 to buy you will enjoy this movie if you have followed the series. I will give it a 4/5 stars for the DVD.,4,Saw 4 is a good scary movie and a 4 star DVD,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,1179,"['was', 'big', 'bounce', 'back', 'saw', '3', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'saw', 'movie', 'lot', 'twist', 'happen', 'finally', 'are', 'endings', 'stuff', 'happened', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'saw', 'series', 'number', 'years', 'saw', '3', 'was', 'huge', 'letdown', 'so', 'felt', 'was', 'key', 'had', 'great', 'movie', 'here', 'terms', 'types', 'killings', 'liked', 'lot', 'better', 'last', 'movie', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', 'sick', 'one', 'guys', 'had', 'eyes', 'sowed', 'shut', 'other', 'had', 'mouth', 'sowed', 'shut', 'drove', 'insanity', 'guy', 'mouth', 'sowed', 'shut', 'killed', 'other', 'guy', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'molesting', 'women', 'was', 'strapped', 'bed', 'had', 'feel', 'there', 'pain', 'body', 'parts', 'were', 'detached', 'think', 'saw', '2', 'had', 'better', 'plots', 'one', 'was', 'second', 'best', 'see', 'just', 'jigsaw', 'died', ""n't"", 'mean', 'saw', 'series', 'stretch', 'fact', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'total', 'ten', 'always', 'drag', 'money', 'have', 'such', 'low', 'budget', 'would', 'recommend', 'saw', '4', 'buy', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'have', 'followed', 'series', 'will', 'give', '4/5', 'stars', 'DVD']",N/A

1124598,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B001053038,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[3, 8]","After Jigsaw died, I had a feeling the franchise would be over. Then I heard studios green-lighted Saw IV BEFORE Saw III was even made, and I thought oh god, not another one. I had my doubts, but listening to the commentary on Saw III assured me they had a plan.And what a plan it was.So far, it seems all the Saw movies have had one prevailing theme to them. Saw II: Patience. Saw III: Forgiveness. Saw IV: Self Preservation. The most vital theme involves people in traps saving them self.Thus is where Lieutenant Rigg is tested, the black cop who has been in all the Saw movies, and seen all his partners die. The film makes it clear right away that Rigg's problem is he cares too much---he wants to save everyone, and everyone (from Jigsaw to his wife) is telling him he can't save everyone.Alongside this, two other story lines go on, including a Lawyer who survived Jigsaw's first test, being put in a second, and flashbacks showing John Kramer's (Jigsaw) life before the events of the series, with his wife Jill, and his job as an engineer. We see what causes him to change, and leave his wife, and eventually (as well as getting cancer) sets about his games, where he personally witnesses his first victim succeed, only to blow it and try to attack Jigaw---to then get himself killed by his own stupid actions.Despite all that's happened, Saw IV has plenty of twists and surprises, including the ultimate shocking turn involving Rigg's game, which I won't reveal here even though I checked the spoiler alert. It's simply too juicy.The events of the film (sans flashbacks) happen simultaneously to the events in Saw III, with the final autopsy shown in the beginning of the movie to set the tone, and to assure people Jigsaw truly IS dead.The gore? Plentiful. It manages to improve upon its predecessors (as the movies always have) without getting overly excessive. The gore isn't there just to gross out or entertain the audience, and is rather tastefully handled, giving it an edge for realism as well as art. The traps are nothing garishly out there, but definitely some of the most creative in the entire franchise.As with Saw III, potentially the goriest, most shock-inducing scene involves Jigsaw himself. Where in Saw III, it was the live, amateur brain surgery, Saw IV steps it up with a live autopsy complete with the nauseating buzz of saws, cracks of bone, and squishing of still-wet flesh and organs, which resemble a true autopsy.For the sake of quashing dreams of fan service, I will safely spoil by saying Dr Gordon is NOT tied to Jigsaw in any further way (though that would remain to be seen for the next two Saws) and both Jigsaw and Amanda are dead.With the series running the risk of being milked by greedy executives into oblivion, the writers/director of the series show that they are masters of the craft of not only modern shock horror but noirish storytelling as well.",5,The absolute best of the franchise so far,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,2899,"['Jigsaw', 'died', 'had', 'feeling', 'franchise', 'would', 'be', 'Then', 'heard', 'studios', 'green-lighted', 'Saw', 'IV', 'BEFORE', 'Saw', 'III', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'thought', 'oh', 'god', 'not', 'one', 'had', 'doubts', 'listening', 'commentary', 'Saw', 'III', 'assured', 'had', 'plan.And', 'what', 'plan', 'far', 'Saw', 'movies', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'prevailing', 'theme', 'Saw', 'II', 'Patience', 'Saw', 'III', 'Forgiveness', 'Saw', 'IV', 'Self', 'Preservation', 'most', 'vital', 'theme', 'people', 'traps', 'saving', 'self.Thus', 'where', 'Lieutenant', 'Rigg', 'tested', 'black', 'cop', 'who', 'been', 'Saw', 'movies', 'seen', 'partners', 'die', 'film', 'clear', 'right', 'away', 'Rigg', 'problem', 'too', 'much', '-he', 'save', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'Jigsaw', 'wife', 'telling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'everyone.Alongside', 'two', 'other', 'story', 'lines', 'go', 'including', 'Lawyer', 'who', 'survived', 'Jigsaw', 'first', 'test', 'being', 'put', 'second', 'flashbacks', 'showing', 'John', 'Kramer', 'Jigsaw', 'life', 'events', 'series', 'wife', 'Jill', 'job', 'engineer', 'see', 'what', 'change', 'leave', 'wife', 'eventually', 'as', 'well', 'getting', 'cancer', 'games', 'where', 'personally', 'first', 'victim', 'succeed', 'only', 'blow', 'try', 'attack', 'Jigaw', '-to', 'then', 'get', 'killed', 'own', 'stupid', 'actions.Despite', 'happened', 'Saw', 'IV', 'plenty', 'twists', 'surprises', 'including', 'ultimate', 'shocking', 'turn', 'involving', 'Rigg', 'game', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'here', 'even', 'checked', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'simply', 'too', 'juicy.The', 'events', 'film', 'sans', 'flashbacks', 'happen', 'simultaneously', 'events', 'Saw', 'III', 'final', 'autopsy', 'shown', 'beginning', 'movie', 'set', 'tone', 'assure', 'people', 'Jigsaw', 'truly', 'dead.The', 'gore', 'Plentiful', 'improve', 'predecessors', 'movies', 'always', 'have', 'getting', 'overly', 'excessive', 'gore', ""n't"", 'there', 'just', 'gross', 'out', 'entertain', 'audience', 'rather', 'tastefully', 'handled', 'giving', 'edge', 'realism', 'as', 'well', 'art', 'traps', 'are', 'nothing', 'garishly', 'there', 'definitely', 'most', 'creative', 'entire', 'franchise.As', 'Saw', 'III', 'potentially', 'goriest', 'most', 'shock-inducing', 'scene', 'Jigsaw', 'Where', 'Saw', 'III', 'was', 'live', 'amateur', 'brain', 'surgery', 'Saw', 'IV', 'up', 'live', 'autopsy', 'complete', 'nauseating', 'buzz', 'saws', 'cracks', 'bone', 'squishing', 'still-wet', 'flesh', 'organs', 'resemble', 'true', 'autopsy.For', 'sake', 'quashing', 'dreams', 'fan', 'service', 'will', 'safely', 'spoil', 'saying', 'Dr', 'Gordon', 'NOT', 'tied', 'Jigsaw', 'further', 'way', 'would', 'remain', 'be', 'seen', 'next', 'two', 'Saws', 'Jigsaw', 'Amanda', 'are', 'series', 'running', 'risk', 'being', 'milked', 'greedy', 'executives', 'oblivion', 'writers/director', 'series', 'show', 'are', 'masters', 'craft', 'not', 'only', 'modern', 'shock', 'horror', 'noirish', 'storytelling', 'as', 'well']",N/A

The plot is simple but at the same time doesn't flow as smoothly as the previous 3 SAWS plots which were more complicated. SAWlV is about a cop who is fed up of his cop friends either going missing or turning up dead. So when he's given the chance to save the latest captives he jumps right to it. There are less traps used and the ones that are, are on the whole less impressive that some past ones. One is 2 people chained to a motorised winch that is pulling them in, Another one is a woman whos hair is being winched in. Another one is a guy standing on a block of ice with a chain round his neck- for some reason he refuses to just stand still. I don't seem to have alot of positives relating to SAWlV but the main ones are that it is extremely well made and is a good springboard for carrying on the SAW films. They had to come up with a convincing way that JIGSAW can recrute someone to carry on his work and SAWlV does do that.

1124604,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B001053038,Brian A. Schar,"[0, 0]","Let me preface this review by saying that I love horror movies.  A good horror movie is good on its own terms; a bad one has potential to be good as a bad movie.  Saw IV fails to live up to its potential either way.  I didn't love Saw III a lot, but it was a decent 2.5-3 star movie, and the cliffhanger ending got me interested in renting Saw IV.  I wish I hadn't.We begin with a seriously fake autopsy.  I've never actually performed one, so maybe it's super-realistic.  But when you see the big pieces of latex (I mean, skin) peeled off of Jigsaw, you might actually start laughing like I did.  That's not an auspicious beginning.  And thus begins Saw IV.  The flashbacks and heavy-handed exposition start coming fast and furious, rendering Saw IV more an exercise in figuring out the overly-complex editing than an exercise in straightforward horror.  We the viewers get to see mild-mannered Jigsaw when he was just a regular old architect or civil engineer or something.  He was more interesting as an enigmatic and all-knowing killing machine.On top of the confusing editing, Saw IV fails to hew to its own internal logic.  One of the key features of a genre film, particularly in SF, horror or fantasy, is to set up simple internal logic and hew to it diligently.  Otherwise, it's very easy to shatter the suspension of disbelief.  One of the key rules of Saw is that Jigsaw lets his victims ""make a choice"" - each gets to live or die based on that choice, and he lets them go if they live.  Indeed, Jigsaw found Shawnee Smith to be an unsuitable pupil due to her failure to follow the rules.  But the big set-piece trap in Saw IV completely ignores the rules, given that at least one of the participants was going to live or die completely due to the actions of someone else.  Please, Saw franchise, if you're going to set up your main character to have a specific character-defining rule, make him follow it.For spoiler-related reasons I won't go into here, the cliffhanger from Saw III isn't merely not resolved - it isn't even mentioned in this movie!  That knocked a star off right there.If you watched Saw III, you will rent Saw IV.  You may, however, call it quits at Saw IV and purposely avoid the remaining films.  I, for one, do not intend to rent Saw XIV to see which 20-year-old footage they're cutting up to make more flashbacks for the 2025 release.

I had always wanted to see them, but I never got around to it. Believe it or not, I got Saw IV from the library, so I figured I would give it a shot.This is a film that wants to be smart. It wants to be, likeSeven, a comment on our country's vices and excesses. Jigsaw doesn't kill at random, you see. No, he wants to punish those who are able to avoid legal justice.

It begins with an autopsy of Jigsaw, and it takes probably five or ten minutes for them to cut through him and peel all the skin back and then remove the organs.

I felt that ""Saw 3"" lost the feel of the original two films, and just became a gore-for-gore's-sake splatter flick. Several folks on the Horror forum here suggested I give ""Saw 4"" a shot, so I picked it up at my local Blockbuster used movie bin for $2.99. Even with this thing sitting on my shelf for months, I would always turn to something else when the horror-bug bit, leaving ""Saw 4"" unopened and collecting dust. This past weekend for some reason I was in the mood to watch a good gore-fest. A flick that would leave blood splatter oozing from my DVD player, and decided it would be a good time to finally see Jigsaw's latest installment. I had low expectations, but as long as it was bloody, I would be happy.To my surprise, ""Saw 4"", while it does have it's moments, may be the least bloody of the series. And to further my surprise, it's actually really good. The focus this time around, fleshes out Jigsaw's backstory, told in flashbacks while police interrogate his ex-wife. All the while a detective caught in Jigsaw's web, tries to unscramble the clues that will save two detective's lives (Mark Wahlberg in an extended cameo). Normally, these backstory entries in a horror series are painfully awful (Halloween 6, A Nightmare on Elm Street: Freddy's Dead etc.) Usually I prefer my killers motives either explained upfront, or left mysterious. But I really liked how Jigsaw actually became a sympathetic figure to a degree in this film. You can understand why he has chosen this life of judgement and cruelty.Of course there are some wicked little twists and turns, and the fantasticly bizarre contraptions that could only work on film, but that is a given in this series. It's best if you leave your realism at the door when watching ""Saw"" anyway.If you were like me and ready to give up on this series after the lousy 3rd entry, give this one a try.

And this movie also tries to show how Jigsaw 'inspires' someone to fill his bloody shoes.  And this movie does a decent job at wrapping itself around the concept of having 'a new rat' run through a maze of gore in Jigsaw's post-mortem attempt at having his work live on.  This is a decent gore movie, and there is an argument for saying it was worth making this flick to bring the Saw chronicles to a close.  But, seriously...IT'S ENOUGH ALREADY!!!  This film is worth getting, and it is good, but this franchise has outlived its usefulness.  I hear they are putting out a Saw 5 in the fall, and even though I have enjoyed the series, I have to say, ""You gotta be kidding me!!!""  Oh well, back to this movie.  The guy who plays the mother's 'backwards hat boyfriend' on The Gilmore Girls is pretty good as the respectable, smart, tough FBI agent in this flick.  The premise is good enough that I can be generous about giving this film a 4 star rating.  There's plenty of gore.  There is even a reasonable attempt at giving a plot in the prequel sequences that explain how Jigsaw began his reign of blood and terror...kind of.

Not to say Saw 4 did not suceed as an enjoyable movie (certainly at this point at #4 in a horror series).  But the problem is there is so much messing around with the timeline and flashback scenes than ever before that it becomes difficult to keep up, at least for me.  I guess that's why I came out more impressed upon initial viewing than the second time around, cause I thought ""Confusing, but wow that's good, right?  It makes one think?""  I realize that doesn't always work well.  But anyways, after the second viewing of Saw 4 I realized that although the movie is constructed in a similar manner as previous films with the flashbacks and its unpredictable ending, it became a little too much this time, and its like they completely made up a wacko ending.  Of course you can't see it coming, but it could have been anyone (well, you'll see what I mean I don't want to give it away).You might wonder how the film could star Tobin Bell since he is dead, but that is where flashbacks come into play, and possibly one of the better enjoyments of Saw 4 is seeing the very origins of Jigsaw, all the way back to his wife.  We even get to see his very first victim and trap, and yes it's bloody enough.  Speaking of traps, as one would expect, they are present throughout Saw 4 and still bloody, graphic, and horrifying.  I didn't feel they were as disturbing as Saw 3, and overall some of the traps are unique and interesting as others are almost boring, but I won't give away any details.  Rigg (Lyric Bent, returning from Saw 2 & 3) is the one we spend most of the time seeing tested in Saw 4, although the games seem to be growing in numbers for eveyone, such as detective Mathews (yes he has still survived, and still played by Donnie Wahlberg) and FBI agents, just to name a few, and there's all those lesser roles who get the pleasure of sitting in those actual torture devices.Saw 4 only works because it's keeping a series going and telling quite a story while always creating more (yes Saw V is due out in theatres this year, and they are planning on Saw VI next year).  As a horror film, Saw 4 lost some of it umph because of the story telling, and getting to know some of the charcaters a bit more (such as Tobin Bell and his ex-wife) but that still makes it a good watch for fans.  The moral of ""cherish your life"" is still present, however the obsession (in Rigg's case) of trying to save everyone (only they can save themselves) is brought to attention.  Well, I never though there was anything wrong with trying to help save people, but apparently Jigsaw believe's otherwise and shows us (and Riggs) why.Acting - 3Characters - 3.5Gore/Horror - 4.5Story - 4Overall - 3.5",4,[3.5] I saw a lot of confusion,1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,2791,"['Forgive', 'silly', 'title', 'what', 'apparently', 'others', 'experienced', 'leaving', 'theatre', 'Not', 'say', 'Saw', '4', 'did', 'not', 'suceed', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'certainly', 'point', '4', 'horror', 'series', 'problem', 'so', 'much', 'messing', 'timeline', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'ever', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'least', 'guess', 'why', 'came', 'out', 'more', 'impressed', 'initial', 'viewing', 'second', 'time', 'cause', 'thought', 'Confusing', 'wow', 'good', 'right', 'one', 'think', 'realize', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'well', 'anyways', 'second', 'viewing', 'Saw', '4', 'realized', 'movie', 'constructed', 'similar', 'manner', 'previous', 'films', 'flashbacks', 'unpredictable', 'ending', 'became', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'completely', 'made', 'up', 'wacko', 'ending', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'anyone', 'well', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', '.You', 'might', 'wonder', 'how', 'film', 'could', 'star', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'dead', 'where', 'flashbacks', 'come', 'play', 'possibly', 'one', 'better', 'enjoyments', 'Saw', '4', 'seeing', 'very', 'Jigsaw', 'way', 'back', 'wife', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'very', 'first', 'victim', 'trap', 'bloody', 'enough', 'Speaking', 'traps', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'are', 'present', 'Saw', '4', 'still', 'bloody', 'graphic', 'horrifying', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'were', 'as', 'disturbing', 'Saw', '3', 'overall', 'traps', 'are', 'unique', 'interesting', 'others', 'are', 'almost', 'boring', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'details', 'Rigg', 'Lyric', 'Bent', 'returning', 'Saw', '2', '3', 'one', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'seeing', 'tested', 'Saw', '4', 'games', 'seem', 'be', 'growing', 'numbers', 'eveyone', 'such', 'detective', 'Mathews', 'yes', 'still', 'survived', 'still', 'played', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'FBI', 'agents', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'lesser', 'roles', 'who', 'get', 'pleasure', 'sitting', 'actual', 'torture', 'devices.Saw', '4', 'only', 'keeping', 'series', 'going', 'telling', 'quite', 'story', 'always', 'creating', 'more', 'yes', 'Saw', 'V', 'due', 'out', 'theatres', 'year', 'are', 'planning', 'Saw', 'VI', 'next', 'year', 'horror', 'film', 'Saw', '4', 'lost', 'umph', 'story', 'telling', 'getting', 'know', 'charcaters', 'bit', 'more', 'such', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'ex-wife', 'still', 'good', 'watch', 'fans', 'moral', 'cherish', 'life', 'still', 'present', 'however', 'obsession', 'Rigg', 'case', 'trying', 'save', 'everyone', 'only', 'can', 'save', 'brought', 'attention', 'Well', 'never', 'was', 'anything', 'wrong', 'trying', 'help', 'save', 'people', 'apparently', 'Jigsaw', 'believe', 'otherwise', 'Riggs', 'why.Acting', '3Characters', '3.5Gore/Horror', '4.5Story', '4Overall', '3.5']",N/A

Sorta strange for me, a bonafide Saw franchise fan to wait that long, but somehow after three chapters I guess the appeal weared thin. But after seeing this one, I still can't say I'm completely tired of the franchise & in fact is sort of happy it's still churning out the sequels. While Saw IV wasn't the greatest film in Saw history, it wasn't it's worse either. The darn thing still has a few miles left in it!To say this film takes place after the events of Saw III would be somewhat correct and not at the same time. In fact, this movie actually takes place during Saw III. At times I was excepting 1960's Batman announcer to say ""Meanwhile, 40 feet away..."". Unlike the first three films that pretty much connect one after the other, early on you can tell the plotline of IV seems to jump all over the place. Is this the beginning? Isn't that the end? Sorta confusing for the Saw crowd, but a refreshing change of pace from the others. Also refreshing here was on top of all that, this film was a prequel of sorts too, showing us the birth of John to become Jigsaw, and that did help give the movie some merit for it's existence, rather than another reason to show his traps. In fact the tagline ""It's A Trap"" should have been called ""It's A Plot"" because of it. Don't worry, this film is still equal to ""Se7en For Dummies"" like the others, but for IV the gore traps didn't seem to be front and center as usual, allowing for more storyline to be shown. While that might make gorehounds nervous, the traps are starting to get more predictable and a change was needed. This change seemed to work, and honestly IV turned out to be much more enjoyable to me than II and III combined.Not that the traps are completely out of the picture, cause they're here, it's just not that big of a deal now...even though one towards the end did make me say ""...Ah, the old **** crushing bit....well done."". And yes, like all the others you get that patented from The Sixth Sense ending, yet this time...don't kill me....I really didn't see it coming! And afterwards I said to myself that this was the only way to keep the franchise going, and only choice & not a bad one to go with. Sure, the plot holes are still huge, the supporting cast is a bunch of ""Who are you again?"", and the flashbacks (or flash-forwards, whatever..like the stuff on Lost, okay?) are still quick and confusing, but that's Saw, it's still what we expect from it. Sorta reminds me of the classic 80's era of sequels, as long as there was a number in the title we were happy mainly due to we were already aware of what we were gonna get. Saw harks back to those days, and I'm glad at least it still does that.As for the DVD, you do get a thirty minute video diary which is somewhat amusing, two commentaries, trailers, but only one deleted scene, which means come around September/early October 2008 expect the Saw IV Special Edition to double-dip your way. Overall, as usual, picture/audio are great, so no worries there.In the end (will Saw end?), I expect Saw to never go out with a bang but a whimper, because I can see this going for at least two or three more chapters now thanks to the turning point given in IV. For any Saw fan, it's still recommended and to those snobbish Horror fans who turned their noses up to Saw due to it's popularity, this flix ain't gonna change that either. In an era where only Harry Potter can see four sequels and beyond, it's nice to know the Nightmare/Halloween/Friday of the 00's generation can accomplish that as well.",4,"Jigsaw May Be Dead, But Saw Still Has Some Life Left In It!",1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,3594,"['three', 'long', 'months', 'DVD', 'finally', 'broke', 'down', 'rented', 'Saw', 'IV', 'Sorta', 'strange', 'bonafide', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'fan', 'wait', 'long', 'somehow', 'three', 'chapters', 'guess', 'appeal', 'weared', 'thin', 'seeing', 'one', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'completely', 'tired', 'franchise', 'fact', 'sort', 'happy', 'still', 'churning', 'out', 'sequels', 'Saw', 'IV', 'was', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'film', 'Saw', 'history', 'was', ""n't"", 'worse', 'darn', 'thing', 'still', 'few', 'miles', 'left', 'say', 'film', 'place', 'events', 'Saw', 'III', 'would', 'be', 'somewhat', 'correct', 'not', 'same', 'time', 'fact', 'movie', 'actually', 'place', 'Saw', 'III', 'times', 'was', 'excepting', '1960', 'Batman', 'announcer', 'say', 'Meanwhile', '40', 'feet', 'away', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'pretty', 'much', 'connect', 'one', 'other', 'early', 'can', 'tell', 'plotline', 'IV', 'jump', 'place', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'end', 'Sorta', 'confusing', 'Saw', 'crowd', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'others', 'Also', 'refreshing', 'here', 'was', 'top', 'film', 'was', 'prequel', 'sorts', 'too', 'showing', 'birth', 'John', 'become', 'Jigsaw', 'did', 'help', 'give', 'movie', 'merit', 'existence', 'rather', 'reason', 'show', 'traps', 'fact', 'tagline', 'Trap', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Plot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'film', 'still', 'equal', 'Se7en', 'Dummies', 'others', 'IV', 'gore', 'traps', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'front', 'center', 'usual', 'allowing', 'more', 'storyline', 'be', 'shown', 'might', 'make', 'gorehounds', 'nervous', 'traps', 'are', 'starting', 'get', 'more', 'predictable', 'change', 'was', 'needed', 'change', 'seemed', 'work', 'honestly', 'IV', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'II', 'III', 'combined.Not', 'traps', 'are', 'completely', 'picture', 'cause', ""'re"", 'here', 'just', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'now', 'even', 'one', 'end', 'did', 'make', 'say', 'Ah', 'old', '****', 'crushing', 'bit', '.well', 'done.', 'yes', 'others', 'get', 'patented', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'ending', 'yet', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'afterwards', 'said', 'myself', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'keep', 'franchise', 'going', 'only', 'choice', 'not', 'bad', 'one', 'go', 'Sure', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'still', 'huge', 'supporting', 'cast', 'bunch', 'Who', 'are', 'again', 'flashbacks', 'flash-forwards', 'stuff', 'Lost', 'okay', 'are', 'still', 'quick', 'confusing', 'Saw', 'still', 'what', 'expect', 'Sorta', 'classic', '80', 'era', 'sequels', 'as', 'long', 'was', 'number', 'title', 'were', 'happy', 'mainly', 'due', 'were', 'already', 'aware', 'what', 'were', 'gon', 'get', 'Saw', 'back', 'days', ""'m"", 'glad', 'least', 'still', 'that.As', 'DVD', 'do', 'get', 'thirty', 'minute', 'video', 'diary', 'somewhat', 'amusing', 'two', 'commentaries', 'trailers', 'only', 'one', 'deleted', 'scene', 'come', 'September/early', 'October', '2008', 'expect', 'Saw', 'IV', 'Special', 'Edition', 'double-dip', 'way', 'Overall', 'usual', 'picture/audio', 'are', 'great', 'so', 'worries', 'there.In', 'end', 'will', 'Saw', 'end', 'expect', 'Saw', 'never', 'go', 'out', 'bang', 'whimper', 'can', 'see', 'going', 'least', 'two', 'three', 'more', 'chapters', 'now', 'turning', 'point', 'given', 'IV', 'Saw', 'fan', 'still', 'recommended', 'snobbish', 'Horror', 'fans', 'who', 'turned', 'noses', 'Saw', 'due', 'popularity', 'flix', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'change', 'era', 'where', 'only', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'can', 'see', 'four', 'sequels', 'nice', 'know', 'Nightmare/Halloween/Friday', '00', 'generation', 'can', 'accomplish', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Maybe its just because the whole 'super intelligent serial killer' has been done before and to far better effect in Seven and the Hannibal series.  The same goes for the hyper fast camera angles, obsessive detective failing at the final clue etc... so I wasn't expecting an awful lot from this one.While Saw 1 was to a large extent gore without purpose, Saw 2 the usual half measured sequel and Saw 3 something of a climax to the trilogy, a sort of lets quit now while we are ahead Saw 4 is just plain awful.Set as a continuation of both Saw 2 (The detective captured by Jigsaw at the end of that film) and Saw 3 (The husband still hanging around imprisoned in the basement) This is just frankly dire.In this film we are treated to the background of Jigsaw, how he became what he is and why.  The film continues with just about the only detective left alive, the leader of the SWAT team in his own personal obsession to find his partner who he believes to be still alive.So again we begin with Jigsaw (Dead we know but hey, since when has that stopped a serial killer? We are even treated to his autopsy at the start of the film then his body bizarrely turns up at the end of the film back in the basement where it was left in Saw 3 (Along with the doctors husband) Now you work that one out, surely if they done an autopsy they found the body, if they found the body they found the doctors husband) up to his usual tricks, setting up elaborate traps and murder devices (Sorry he doesn't kill he leaves the victim to make the choice!) We are even given one of the detectives saying ""How does someone bring all this stuff into a hotel"" ""Piece by piece over days"" Comes the reply.  Its almost as bad as a kids cartoon I was half expecting ""And I would have gotten away with it were it not for you meddling kids"" TO chirp in!Murder, hack, chop, gore.  Reverse camera angles, lots of spinning heads, repeat Acton camera shots (hands slamming on tables, stressed looking cops) Problem with a film like this is it tries to be cleaver when in reality it just isn't.  Films like Halloween are a damn sight better because they make no attempt at being cleaver they are just popcorn horror.  This is just clutching at straws plot writing with a director hoping that the viewer gets carried along with the Saw bandwagon.  Problem is, the wheel has fallen off and people starting to lose interest.Yes, the director has (not so) cleverly given us the new Jigsaw (well he had to after killing off his last prodigy in the other film) So I guess we can look forward to a Saw 5 which I suppose will be the son of the detective who died, his wife's brother, sisters uncles cat, bloke 2 doors down the road or some other weak link to the previous films.Awful film, file under lost the plot long ago.",1,Absolutely awful,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,2850,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'much', 'fan', 'Saw', 'films', 'Maybe', 'just', 'whole', 'intelligent', 'serial', 'killer', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'far', 'better', 'effect', 'Seven', 'Hannibal', 'series', 'same', 'hyper', 'fast', 'camera', 'angles', 'obsessive', 'detective', 'failing', 'final', 'clue', 'etc', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'awful', 'lot', 'one.While', 'Saw', '1', 'was', 'large', 'extent', 'gore', 'purpose', 'Saw', '2', 'usual', 'half', 'measured', 'sequel', 'Saw', '3', 'something', 'climax', 'trilogy', 'sort', 'lets', 'quit', 'now', 'are', 'ahead', 'Saw', '4', 'just', 'plain', 'awful.Set', 'continuation', 'Saw', '2', 'detective', 'captured', 'Jigsaw', 'end', 'film', '3', 'husband', 'still', 'hanging', 'around', 'imprisoned', 'basement', 'just', 'frankly', 'dire.In', 'film', 'are', 'treated', 'background', 'Jigsaw', 'how', 'became', 'what', 'why', 'film', 'just', 'only', 'detective', 'left', 'alive', 'leader', 'SWAT', 'team', 'own', 'personal', 'obsession', 'find', 'partner', 'who', 'be', 'still', 'alive.So', 'again', 'begin', 'Jigsaw', 'Dead', 'know', 'hey', 'when', 'stopped', 'serial', 'killer', 'are', 'even', 'treated', 'autopsy', 'start', 'film', 'then', 'body', 'bizarrely', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'back', 'basement', 'where', 'was', 'left', 'Saw', '3', 'doctors', 'husband', 'Now', 'work', 'one', 'out', 'surely', 'done', 'autopsy', 'found', 'body', 'found', 'body', 'found', 'doctors', 'husband', 'usual', 'tricks', 'setting', 'up', 'elaborate', 'traps', 'murder', 'devices', 'Sorry', ""n't"", 'kill', 'victim', 'make', 'choice', 'are', 'even', 'given', 'one', 'detectives', 'saying', 'How', 'someone', 'bring', 'stuff', 'hotel', 'Piece', 'piece', 'days', 'reply', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'kids', 'cartoon', 'was', 'half', 'expecting', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'were', 'not', 'meddling', 'kids', 'TO', 'chirp', 'Murder', 'hack', 'chop', 'gore', 'Reverse', 'camera', 'angles', 'lots', 'spinning', 'heads', 'repeat', 'Acton', 'camera', 'shots', 'hands', 'slamming', 'tables', 'stressed', 'looking', 'cops', 'Problem', 'film', 'be', 'cleaver', 'when', 'reality', 'just', ""n't"", 'Films', 'Halloween', 'are', 'damn', 'sight', 'better', 'make', 'attempt', 'being', 'cleaver', 'are', 'just', 'popcorn', 'horror', 'just', 'clutching', 'straws', 'plot', 'writing', 'director', 'hoping', 'viewer', 'carried', 'Saw', 'bandwagon', 'Problem', 'wheel', 'fallen', 'off', 'people', 'starting', 'lose', 'interest.Yes', 'director', 'not', 'so', 'cleverly', 'given', 'new', 'Jigsaw', 'well', 'had', 'killing', 'off', 'last', 'prodigy', 'other', 'film', 'guess', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'Saw', '5', 'suppose', 'will', 'be', 'son', 'detective', 'who', 'died', 'wife', 'brother', 'sisters', 'uncles', 'cat', 'bloke', '2', 'doors', 'road', 'other', 'weak', 'link', 'previous', 'films.Awful', 'film', 'file', 'lost', 'plot', 'long', 'ago']",N/A

If you ever wondered why no one came to help any of the characters in Saw 3 then Saw 4 will answer your questions. Sadly, the characters are still all very stupid, despite their supposed training, and do not think logically to get out of their situation.SWAT commander Rigg is thrown into a new game by Jiggy in which he has to help some people and hurt others. As he runs all over the unamed city the FBI pick up the pieces of Jiggy's life and slowly begin to unravel his master plan.It's a clever story, but, once more, it is undone by horrendous editing, an idiotic sound design, and cheap, filtered photography full of quick fixes in post production. I'm not kidding, there are scenes where you can tell that the film was shot too darkly and they've lightened an area of the picture to make it more visible, thus turning black actor Lyriq Bent's face a shade of stupid purple. It's no mystery why this film won no technical Oscars. It looks like an angry child's nightmare. This series would look great if shot like a late 70s/early 80s exploitation film (which it essentially is). The post-modern fakery does not suit it at all.To it's credit, it does pack in a LOT into the 91-minute running time, but it comes at the expense of coherence. What happened to the scalped hooker? Who is the the blinded guy in the mausoleum? Why doesn't Art just barricade the door and save Donnie Wahlberg's long suffering detective?

Next to Eric is Detective Hoffman also in a trap.Rigg has exactly 90 minutes to find them and save both of them. He is sent on a wild goose chase putting other people's lives in jeopardy trying to save their own.Meanwhile, Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) is working on the case.  They interrogate John's ex-wife, Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell) for umpteenth time.This time the agents mean business and they want answers out of her.We then are treated to never-before-seen flashbacks that are important clues as to why John became so menacing and hateful to the point of a manic murderer.Amanda is dead.

Enjoy.A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.Saw FOUR begins with ONE person trapped in an abandoned MEATPACKING PLANT.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer) game, LT. DANIEL RIGG (Lyriq Bent) has to prove his will to live, and his ability to MEASURE LIFE'S WORTH.  Meanwhile, FBI AGENTS PETER STRAHAM (Scott Patterson) and LINDSEY PEREZ (Athena Karkanis), and rugged veteran DET. MARK HOFFMAN (Costas Mandylor) are investigating as a team, but MARK HOFFMAN may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participant learns that an OFFICER may be an accomplice to his abduction, and his situation provides a choice between WITNESSING MORBID CONTRAPTIONS or guaranteed death.  To help his cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead him (aka a life perpetrator) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.Several previous murderous contraptions like the EYE SPIKE BED TRAP (for a RAPIST), the SCALP RIPPER HAIR PULL TRAP (for a female PIMP), and the KNIFE CHAIR TRAP (for a JUNKIE who caused a miscarriage) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the ICE BLOCK HEAD SMASHER - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S HISTORY, and on to Saw V.Jason Elin",3,Saw IV - Postmortem murder,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,1927,"['consecutively', 'watching', 'entire', 'Saw', 'series', 'recent', 'weekend', 'LOVING', 'decided', 'single', 'review', 'modified', 'details', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'films', 'Enjoy.A', 'sadistic', 'sociopath', 'similar', 'one', 'Se7en', 'affinity', 'engineering', 'play', 'lethal', 'games', 'forcing', 'victims', 'unappreciative', 'life', 'existential', 'choice', 'million', 'dollars', 'worth', 'engineering', 'machinery.Saw', 'FOUR', 'ONE', 'person', 'trapped', 'abandoned', 'MEATPACKING', 'PLANT', 'Forced', 'play', 'killer', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'John', 'Jigsaw', 'Kramer', 'game', 'LT.', 'DANIEL', 'RIGG', 'Lyriq', 'Bent', 'prove', 'will', 'live', 'ability', 'MEASURE', 'LIFE', 'WORTH', 'Meanwhile', 'FBI', 'AGENTS', 'PETER', 'STRAHAM', 'Scott', 'Patterson', 'LINDSEY', 'PEREZ', 'Athena', 'Karkanis', 'rugged', 'veteran', 'DET', 'MARK', 'HOFFMAN', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'are', 'investigating', 'team', 'MARK', 'HOFFMAN', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'deep', 'law', 'increasingly', 'closer', 'ensnaring', 'Jigsaw', 'game', 'participant', 'OFFICER', 'may', 'be', 'accomplice', 'abduction', 'situation', 'choice', 'WITNESSING', 'MORBID', 'CONTRAPTIONS', 'guaranteed', 'death', 'help', 'cause', 'cryptic', 'clues', 'left', 'mini', 'cassette', 'tape', 'lead', 'aka', 'life', 'perpetrator', 'precipice', 'twisted', 'rehabilitation', 'potential', 'tomb.Several', 'previous', 'murderous', 'contraptions', 'EYE', 'SPIKE', 'BED', 'TRAP', 'RAPIST', 'SCALP', 'RIPPER', 'HAIR', 'PULL', 'TRAP', 'female', 'PIMP', 'KNIFE', 'CHAIR', 'TRAP', 'JUNKIE', 'who', 'caused', 'miscarriage', 'provide', 'horror', 'fodder', 'form', 'viscera', 'blood', 'spatter', 'other', 'traps', 'ICE', 'BLOCK', 'HEAD', 'SMASHER', 'are', 'inserted', 'same', 'reason', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'always', 'took', 'ensign', 'Jones', 'away', 'parties', 'someone', 'situation', 'die', 'horribly', 'Climax', 'cliffhanger', 'are', 'quick', 'succession', 'flashbacks', 'provide', 'necessary', 'details', 'viewer', 'more', 'JIGSAW', 'HISTORY', 'Saw', 'V.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A
1124629,A160F6VXGUC5V4,B001053038,"Jason Weyandt ""Complete Dork""","[0, 1]",In my opinion this is the worst Saw out of all 4. The plot is really getting sparse here and I don't know what the other reviewers are seeing but to pretend the plot and script are tricky or intelligient is just goofy. A prime example of this is the premise that all of the new deaths occur after an autopsy of John Cramer's(Tobin Bell) body reveals a tape inside of his stomach. If you pay attention the new killer is provoked into killing after he hears Jigsaw's last tape but the movie ends with the new killer standing next to John's body back at HIS building from Saw 3. Am I just stupid or how can the detective find this tape and begin killing if Jigsaw's body never left the building and there-by never had an autopsy performed. Please see the movie and tell me where I went wrong.Blu-ray picture is as good as the other 3 and the sound is the same quality as well.

1124630,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B001053038,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[6, 8]","Even death can't stop Jigsaw, once again played marvelously by Tobin Bell, from another killing spree.This time, the focus is on Sgt. Rigg (Lyriq Bent).  Rigg originally appeared in Saw II.  All of the partners he's worked with have died at the hands of Jigsaw, except for Detective Matthems (Donnie Wahlberg).  Matthews has somehow managed to survive for 6 months, but his life literally hangs in the balance.  Rigg is captured and forced to endure one of Jigsaw's puzzles in order to be able to save Matthews.  Also captured is Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor).  His fate is tied to that of Matthews.  If Matthews dies, so will Hoffman.  Rigg has 90  minutes to locate Matthews, but along the way, he's forced to deal with the challenges set in place for him.  Each involves a choice; Rigg can stay and help, but use valuable time, or he can simply ignore the victim and move on.  What will he choose?  Will he reach Matthews before its too late?I've seen the previous three Saw films, and this one is better than those.  One part I especially liked about this move was the look back into Jigsaw's life when he was simply John Kramer.  John had to deal with many problems in his life, including the loss of his unborn child.  This single event is what sent John over the edge.  I also liked how the characters from the previous films were brought back together in this movie.  The ending is the best part of the movie, as many people competing to overcome their own series of traps meet in an explosive climax.  Many questions are answered at the end of the movie.I give this fine suspenseful movie my highest recommendation.  The Saw series has become one of my favorites, and the movies keep getting better and better.  I can only hope that the director will somehow find a way to keep Jigsaw around for part 5.

1124632,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B001053038,Jonathan Appleseed,"[13, 20]","Before watching Saw IV, I might suggest watching Saw III again, or at least finding a review that summarizes the main plot points. Anyone other than an entrenched Saw-vehicle fan or someone with a very good memory is going to find themselves a tad lost or confused. Not that I think it matters, though, because rewatching Saw III for insight into Saw IV is a waste of time in my opinion. But you'll be less lost.I've enjoyed the Saw films for their vague and simplistic morality tales spun with healthy (or unhealthy) amounts of stomach wrenching carnage; somewhat of a dumbed-down and gored-up Seven. This film tried to buck the trend: it tried to be smarter, and while the gore is present, it's dealt out in significantly smaller portions.The movie has a surprise ending. It could open doors, or it could have shut them down forever. Whichever, I've stopped caring, and if there is another film, I certainly won't watch it.At least five minutes of this ninety-five minute film are repeated scenes. For example: a furious FBI agent flies into a rage and throws all of the papers off of his desk. Then they show the scene from a different angle, at a different starting point, and then they do it again, and then they do it again, and then they do it again, and then they do it again. Did that last sentence annoy you? Well, that's how the scene felt. Sadly, there were several scenes just like it, and they were incredibly annoying. It's not a hallmark of good filmmaking; rather, it's exactly the opposite.As it was trying to be a smarter Saw, I was surprised at the outright stupidity of some of the characters. While I won't reveal secrets, I will pose this question: if you were a highly trained FBI agent (aren't they all highly trained?), and you come across the marionette/puppet that Jigsaw used in his videos, and you saw that the eyes of the puppet were red, and that they were moving, would you immediately get closer for a better look, or back away quickly, concerned of a potential trap? If you chose to get closer for a better look, then you're an idiot, and deserve what happens.A film that presents its audience with a surprise ending has to stand up to the test of the `Second Viewing'. The Sixth Sense is the perfect example of such a film. Most people were surprised at the ending, and a good number of people watched the film again, to see if the director cheated at all. We all know that he didn't. It was a perfect film (the last perfect film he made, but how many people make even one downright awful film in their life?), and it stood up to the second, third, and fourth viewing. Everything is done absolutely right so that when the veil is lifted, you don't feel cheated.Saw IV did not stand up to that test. It didn't stand up to its own `recap', where when the secret is revealed the director flashes back to important scenes as if to say, ""See, I wasn't cheating...I set it up just so."" But it wasn't just so, because there was absolutely ZERO motivation for the person involved in the surprise ending. None. And watching Saw III won't help you find any, because it's not there either.My last beef with this is similar to a problem I had with Saw III. No offense to Tobin Bell personally, but on what planet does someone as pretty as Betsy Russell tie her star to him? I mean, is this pornography, where men could only feel comfortable watching it if a vile and unattractive man was involved in the picture, to ensure no homoerotic `uprisings'? No, it's not. And yes, every so often a Julia Roberts marries a Lyle Lovett--but not to the extent that it happens, or is displayed to have happen, on the silver screen. This is a problem endemic in Hollywood, even (or especially) in sitcoms. How many of George Costanza's girlfriends looked right with him?At least one element of this film could have been realistic.",2,"Tried to be a smarter film, but ultimately failed",1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,3841,"['watching', 'Saw', 'IV', 'might', 'suggest', 'watching', 'Saw', 'III', 'again', 'least', 'finding', 'review', 'main', 'plot', 'points', 'Anyone', 'other', 'entrenched', 'Saw-vehicle', 'fan', 'someone', 'very', 'good', 'memory', 'going', 'find', 'tad', 'lost', 'confused', 'Not', 'think', 'though', 'rewatching', 'Saw', 'III', 'insight', 'Saw', 'IV', 'waste', 'time', 'opinion', ""'ll"", 'be', 'less', 'lost.I', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Saw', 'films', 'vague', 'simplistic', 'morality', 'tales', 'spun', 'healthy', 'unhealthy', 'amounts', 'stomach', 'wrenching', 'carnage', 'somewhat', 'dumbed-down', 'gored-up', 'Seven', 'film', 'tried', 'buck', 'trend', 'tried', 'be', 'smarter', 'gore', 'present', 'dealt', 'out', 'significantly', 'smaller', 'portions.The', 'movie', 'surprise', 'ending', 'could', 'open', 'doors', 'could', 'have', 'shut', 'down', 'forever', 'Whichever', ""'ve"", 'stopped', 'caring', 'film', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'it.At', 'least', 'five', 'minutes', 'ninety-five', 'minute', 'film', 'are', 'repeated', 'scenes', 'example', 'furious', 'FBI', 'agent', 'flies', 'rage', 'papers', 'desk', 'Then', 'show', 'scene', 'different', 'angle', 'different', 'starting', 'point', 'then', 'do', 'again', 'then', 'do', 'again', 'then', 'do', 'again', 'then', 'do', 'again', 'Did', 'last', 'sentence', 'annoy', 'Well', 'how', 'scene', 'felt', 'Sadly', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', 'just', 'were', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'not', 'hallmark', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'rather', 'exactly', 'opposite.As', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'smarter', 'Saw', 'was', 'surprised', 'outright', 'stupidity', 'characters', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'secrets', 'will', 'pose', 'question', 'were', 'highly', 'trained', 'FBI', 'agent', 'are', ""n't"", 'highly', 'trained', 'come', 'marionette/puppet', 'Jigsaw', 'used', 'videos', 'saw', 'eyes', 'puppet', 'were', 'red', 'were', 'moving', 'would', 'immediately', 'get', 'closer', 'better', 'look', 'back', 'away', 'quickly', 'concerned', 'potential', 'trap', 'chose', 'get', 'closer', 'better', 'look', 'then', ""'re"", 'idiot', 'deserve', 'what', 'happens.A', 'film', 'audience', 'surprise', 'ending', 'stand', 'up', 'test', 'Second', 'Viewing', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'perfect', 'example', 'film', 'Most', 'people', 'were', 'surprised', 'ending', 'good', 'number', 'people', 'watched', 'film', 'again', 'see', 'director', 'cheated', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'perfect', 'film', 'last', 'perfect', 'film', 'made', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'make', 'even', 'one', 'downright', 'awful', 'film', 'life', 'stood', 'up', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'viewing', 'Everything', 'done', 'absolutely', 'right', 'so', 'when', 'veil', 'lifted', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cheated.Saw', 'IV', 'did', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'test', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'own', 'recap', 'where', 'when', 'secret', 'revealed', 'director', 'back', 'important', 'scenes', 'say', 'See', 'was', ""n't"", 'cheating', 'set', 'up', 'just', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'so', 'was', 'absolutely', 'ZERO', 'motivation', 'person', 'involved', 'surprise', 'ending', 'None', 'watching', 'Saw', 'III', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'find', 'not', 'there', 'either.My', 'last', 'beef', 'similar', 'problem', 'had', 'Saw', 'III', 'offense', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'personally', 'what', 'planet', 'someone', 'as', 'pretty', 'Betsy', 'Russell', 'star', 'mean', 'pornography', 'where', 'men', 'could', 'only', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'watching', 'vile', 'unattractive', 'man', 'was', 'involved', 'picture', 'ensure', 'homoerotic', 'uprisings', 'No', 'not', 'yes', 'so', 'often', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Lyle', 'Lovett', 'not', 'extent', 'displayed', 'have', 'happen', 'silver', 'screen', 'problem', 'endemic', 'Hollywood', 'even', 'especially', 'sitcoms', 'How', 'many', 'George', 'Costanza', 'girlfriends', 'looked', 'right', 'least', 'one', 'element', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'realistic']",N/A

1124634,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001053038,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 3]","How long can a horror franchise continue before the movies within the series become just plain bad? For most franchises it's only a matter of two, maybe three movies before this occurs. Some examples would be the 'Halloween' series, the first 2 movies were solid entries into what at the time was a burgeoning franchise, but by ""Halloween 3: The Season of the Witch"" the series lost its footing and never seemed to regain it until the seventh installment ""Halloween: H20"". The majority of horror franchises aren't as fortunate as 'Halloween', because generally speaking once a franchise suffers one negative entry in terms of box office take or audience reaction, the series never gets back to what made it work in the first place. A perfect example would be the 'Friday the 13th' series, by the third film the series had tanked; however, in its case the films, as bad as they were, still made a lot of money so the studio kept cranking out more and more until the series eventually ran its course with the 10th entry, ""Jason X"". Now I come to the series at hand, the 'Saw' franchise of horror films. The first 3 films in the series were better-than-average horror films, with the first film being the best. After releasing ""Saw 2"" and ""Saw 3"" with great success in terms of box office returns, Lionsgate had a virtual no-brainer when it came down to whether or not to return to the lucrative series for more traps and more lessons on valuing one's life. Well, Lionsgate gave the 3rd sequel a go ahead, but the difference between this film and its predecessors was the fact that the writers for the previous three films did not return for this installment. So, with a different set of writers, along with the same director that helmed the previous two films, and numerous returning cast members from the first 3 movies, plus a few new ones to throw into the mix, the question that needs answered is, ""Can this latest installment into the franchise possibly live up to the standards of the previous films?""""Saw 4"" does the exact same thing as the previous films had done; it begins exactly where the previous film left off. Meaning, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dead, yet his traps that he set into motion prior to his death are still being played out. The victim this time is Sgt. Rigg (Lyriq Bent), whose only flaw is the fact that he feels the need to save everyone, but through his obsession he has managed to alienate his wife and some of the people that he works with at the police department. Now, from beyond the grave Jigsaw, will test Rigg's commitment to his obsession with saving lives, and whether or not he can actually let go of some of the lives he failed to save in the past that continually haunt him to this day.Well, it finally happened, the 'Saw' series has now joined the pantheon of average or below average horror franchises by having an installment whose quality is so beneath its predecessors that it reeked of existing purely to cash in on the name and the fame of those that had come before. When neither of the two writers from the first 3 films (James Wan and Leigh Whannell) opted to return to pen the fourth installment, that was the first warning sign that this series was going down the tubes; however, the one possible saving grace for ""Saw 4"" was the fact that director Darren Lynn Bousman (""Saw 2 and 3"") was returning to helm this current installment. In the end, the only thing Bousman's presence did for this movie was ensure a steady directorial hand that has had plenty of experience with this franchise to keep the proceedings in a similar tone and feel, but other than that his presence did nothing to elevate the film above its meager standards. From this moment on the 'Saw' films will most likely be no different than your average, run-of-the-mill horror series, where each installment is worse than the previous one, yet until the movies quit making money at the box office we'll still see more traps, more gore, and more mayhem at the hands of the now deceased Jigsaw (for those unaware he died in the third film).The cast of ""Saw 4"" was essentially a reunion of many of the primary cast members from the first 3 films in the series. Donnie Wahlberg, Lyriq Bent, Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, and Angus MacFadyen each make appearances in the film, some with more substance than others, with a few of the appearances feeling like nothing more than tacked on cameo appearances that seemed to come out of nowhere. The newest addition to the cast, Scott Patterson (TV's ""Gilmore Girls"") was average as an FBI agent trying to piece together the recent murders that were the result of the various nefarious traps set by Jigsaw. However, the problem with Patterson's performance was that he seemed to overact in many places, trying too hard to seem like the tough-as-nails, no nonsense FBI agent, that he instead came off as fake and even a little forced, allowing for none of his natural charisma and charm that he had shown so often on TV to shine through to make for an interesting character that the audience could root for.My biggest complaint in regards to ""Saw 4"" lies in the inferior story that was written by series newcomers, Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan. Not only did these two writers craft the worst installment in the series thus far, but they also continued the trend that had begun in ""Saw 3"", by trying to humanize the villain Jigsaw to the audience. As I said in my review for ""Saw 3"", when the initial signs of trying to gain sympathy for Jigsaw first appeared, why do Hollywood writers feel the need to make villains in movies more human so that the audience will possibly empathize with them? I just want a villain to remain simply that, a villain, with his motives selfish and evil, not having his actions be caused by some unfortunate incident in his past that twisted him in such a way that he felt he had no possible alternative than to allow the darkness to consume him. I didn't mind that in ""Saw 2"" the writers introduced the fact that Jigsaw had cancer, and that this terrible news essentially drove him insane and started him on the dark path to murder and mayhem that we had seen in the series. This aspect of the character was fine, and provided just the right amount of back story as to why Jigsaw does what he does, but it didn't make any overt attempts to create sympathy from the audience, and seemed to serve the purpose of showing that the darkness had been within Jigsaw all along and merely needed a release.""Saw 4"" is without a doubt the weakest installment in the franchise, but it is also the goriest as well. It seemed like the biggest purpose for this movie was to just put more blood and guts on the screen, and not worry too much about substance within the story. In the defense of ""Saw 4"", though it is the weakest of the series, it merely continued the already weakening storyline that had shown signs of trouble back in ""Saw 2"" and barely redeemed itself ever so briefly during portions of ""Saw 3"". Ultimately this series was destined to fall prey to the shortcomings that befall most horror franchises; the shifting of focus from providing quality storytelling and good scares to merely cranking out as many films as possible before the interest fades. When this occurs the subsequent installments become lesser and lesser in quality and entertainment value.""Saw 4"" is available in rated R and unrated editions, both contain violence and

1124636,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B001053038,K. Driscoll,"[4, 9]","There are a couple of things one needs to know before reading on or for that matter watching this film.  Firstly, if you are aSawfan you might like this.  I am a not a fan of the Saw sequels.  I actually despise them so take that for what it is.  Secondly, if you haven't seen these films this is no place to start.  If you watch thefirst oneand then find your brain craving some bizarre inner need to watch even more unnecessary and gratuitous depictions of bloodshed, then soldier on through its sequels.  For the record, I don't put much stock into the quality of the original either.The Jigsaw Killer died in theprevious sequel, so here we just see the echoes of his self-righteous manipulations take their toll and wreak havoc on his victims even after his death.  The plot detail is long and a bit convoluted but really the ideas behind the traps and the many twists the film has are not bad, it is just that the cliche gets a bit tiring after a while.  If the film were done outside of the context of an obvious exploitation money-making machine I might even be praising how clever some of the film's details are.  The trouble is the film's goals are so obvious that quality in other respects (e.g. acting) is clearly placed aside in favor of making it's targeted audience squirm and cringe.  This is the modern dayA Nightmare on Elm StreetorFriday the 13thsequel but disguised underneath its surface of complexity and with far more in your face death/torture scenes.  To me, those aforementioned slasher film sequels had some comical charm within their obvious exploits, but the Saw franchise is pretending to be above that and that is unforgivable.  It is also somewhat sad that so many people would flock to see this.  It made $133 million worldwide ($63 million domestically) but cost just $10 million to make.  Either I don't get it at all, or I do get it and it's pretty twisted that so many people enjoy something so violent and so poorly done.I'm making myself out to be a movie snob for sure (and I probably am) but keep in mind I'm not opposed to violence in films.  In fact, I can even appreciate the use of violence to this extreme when it occurs in a serious and believable production or better yet in a film that doesn't have the intention of being taken seriously.  Saw IV's problem is that it takes itself seriously but doesn't in anyway feel remotely believable and even within the franchise's existence as a streamlined blockbuster producing monster, that is not acceptable to me.  Then again it's quite definitely acceptable for a lot of people.  That fact makes me squirm and cringe far more than the clever antics of the Jigsaw Killer.",1,Torturing Myself with Torture Porn,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,2663,"['are', 'couple', 'things', 'one', 'know', 'reading', 'matter', 'watching', 'film', 'Firstly', 'are', 'aSawfan', 'might', 'like', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Saw', 'sequels', 'actually', 'despise', 'so', 'take', 'what', 'Secondly', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'films', 'place', 'start', 'watch', 'thefirst', 'oneand', 'then', 'find', 'brain', 'craving', 'bizarre', 'inner', 'need', 'watch', 'even', 'more', 'unnecessary', 'gratuitous', 'depictions', 'bloodshed', 'then', 'soldier', 'sequels', 'record', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'much', 'stock', 'quality', 'original', 'either.The', 'Jigsaw', 'Killer', 'died', 'theprevious', 'sequel', 'so', 'here', 'just', 'see', 'echoes', 'self-righteous', 'manipulations', 'take', 'toll', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'victims', 'even', 'death', 'plot', 'detail', 'long', 'bit', 'convoluted', 'really', 'ideas', 'traps', 'many', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'cliche', 'bit', 'tiring', 'while', 'film', 'were', 'done', 'outside', 'context', 'obvious', 'exploitation', 'money-making', 'machine', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'praising', 'how', 'clever', 'film', 'details', 'are', 'trouble', 'film', 'goals', 'are', 'so', 'obvious', 'quality', 'other', 'respects', 'e.g', 'acting', 'clearly', 'placed', 'aside', 'favor', 'making', 'targeted', 'audience', 'squirm', 'cringe', 'modern', 'dayA', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'StreetorFriday', '13thsequel', 'disguised', 'surface', 'complexity', 'far', 'more', 'face', 'death/torture', 'scenes', 'aforementioned', 'slasher', 'film', 'sequels', 'had', 'comical', 'charm', 'obvious', 'exploits', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'pretending', 'be', 'unforgivable', 'also', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'flock', 'see', 'made', '133', 'million', 'worldwide', '63', 'million', 'domestically', 'cost', 'just', '10', 'million', 'make', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'get', 'pretty', 'twisted', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'enjoy', 'something', 'so', 'violent', 'so', 'poorly', 'done.I', ""'m"", 'making', 'be', 'movie', 'snob', 'sure', 'probably', 'am', 'keep', 'mind', ""'m"", 'not', 'opposed', 'violence', 'films', 'fact', 'can', 'even', 'appreciate', 'use', 'violence', 'extreme', 'when', 'serious', 'believable', 'production', 'better', 'yet', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'intention', 'being', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Saw', 'IV', 'problem', 'seriously', ""n't"", 'anyway', 'feel', 'remotely', 'believable', 'even', 'franchise', 'existence', 'streamlined', 'blockbuster', 'producing', 'monster', 'not', 'acceptable', 'Then', 'again', 'quite', 'definitely', 'acceptable', 'lot', 'people', 'fact', 'squirm', 'cringe', 'far', 'more', 'clever', 'antics', 'Jigsaw', 'Killer']",N/A

Granted ""Saw 4"" isn't the best movie of the ""Saw"" series, but still good to watch if you have enjoyed watching the 1st three movies in the series.The acting and storyline is good.... However, my favorite feature in ""Saw 4"" had to be the way in which the filmmakers made the transition from scene to scene in the movie.... It is a little difficult to articulate in words, but the basic idea is that camera shows you a scene in the movie and just when you think the camera is just changing its perspective within that same scene, the camera is actually taking you to another scene in the movie.

The film flowed nice, even with all the flashback sequences.  The problem is that they tried too hard to tie the film in with the others and made it WAY too confusing towards the end. Other than that, it's all been done.  The look and feel was still there from the first films, but I think it's time to unplug the Saw and leave it alone now.

Sadly though, there isn't anything too compelling that's really going on in Saw IV, as a good number of the various traps just don't seem as imaginitive as they did in the past films, and as a whole, Saw IV just comes off as sadly boring and predictable.  The best moments of Saw IV though are undoubtedly the scenes where we get past glimpses of just what lead brilliant engineer John on the road to becoming to Jigsaw, and the traps are grisly and gorey enough to satisfy fans of the franchise.  Of course, there are plenty of openings left for future films, which hopefully will improve upon the foundation that has been built by original creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell, as well as by Bousman (who will not be directing the series' next installment).

The most iconic thing about Saw are the traps, and they don't even make sense anymore. These traps are about as arbitrary as the placement of those impossibly hidden items in Super Pitfall. The traps used to be clever, and the theme of the trap used to tie in with the recipient of the trap. For example, from Saw 1, a person who had slit his wrists was ironically in a razor wire trap. In Saw 4, a prostitute was in a trap that... rips her scalp off, obviously.The story isn't even coherent anymore. When 90% of the movie is told through flashbacks, you've got a problem. With all these flashbacks, they're creating this false sense of artificially created depth and lore to the characters which is simply not there. You can't just arbitrarily concoct a character's history and customize a story already told by just creating a flashback on the spot and saying, ""see, see all that? That's the history on this guy, isn't it interesting what all is going on with him and how it ties in to everything else?"" No not really.Parts I hated:--Jigsaw's wife was annoying. She had that one expression the entire movie, that unrealistic sneer on her stupid little face.--When that one cop lady got shot through her mandible with that bow and arrow, the two other cops' reactions weren't realistic, they didn't appear as startled as they should be after witnessing something so gruesome.--In general, I hate how this series now relies on gore to scare you. It's no longer the clever writing, the atmosphere, or the logical traps, now it's just relying on showing you the uncensored dismantling of the human body to creep you out.--Isn't it about time they done away with that little camera effect they use where it speeds up and does that panning 360 or whatever around the person/trap and then slows down. Isn't that just a bit old now? No?--The guy named Rigg that's going around trying to save everyone- so basically he wants to save everyone's life, and has the kind of disposition and values that drive him to do that, yet this same guy would put another human being in a TORTURE DEVICE? I'm not saying I wouldn't do it (whether the unlucky person was a rapist or not), I'm saying, these two actions should be mutually exclusive. A person who's sooo blindly caught up in having to save the lives of all these people he's coming across, yet he's twisted enough to knowingly put another person into a device that will most likely leave them significantly lighter by several pounds? I don't buy it. You're either the kind of person that does one or the other, but not both.",3,"ENOUGH already, we've seen enough Saws",1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,2874,"['watched', 'same', 'disdain', 'spiteful', 'attitude', 'watched', 'second', 'season', 'Heroes', 'third', 'season', 'Prison', 'Break', 'just', 'thinking', 'ok', 'let', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'worse', 'series', 'progressively', 'got', 'worse', 'sequel', 'not', 'only', 'writing', 'story', 'traps', 'most', 'iconic', 'thing', 'Saw', 'are', 'traps', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'anymore', 'traps', 'are', 'as', 'arbitrary', 'placement', 'impossibly', 'hidden', 'items', 'Super', 'Pitfall', 'traps', 'used', 'be', 'clever', 'theme', 'trap', 'used', 'tie', 'recipient', 'trap', 'example', 'Saw', '1', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'slit', 'wrists', 'was', 'ironically', 'razor', 'wire', 'trap', 'Saw', '4', 'prostitute', 'was', 'trap', 'scalp', 'obviously.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'even', 'coherent', 'anymore', 'When', '90', '%', 'movie', 'told', 'flashbacks', ""'ve"", 'got', 'problem', 'flashbacks', ""'re"", 'creating', 'false', 'sense', 'artificially', 'created', 'depth', 'lore', 'characters', 'simply', 'not', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'arbitrarily', 'character', 'history', 'customize', 'story', 'already', 'told', 'just', 'creating', 'flashback', 'spot', 'saying', 'see', 'see', 'history', 'guy', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'what', 'going', 'how', 'everything', 'else', 'not', 'really.Parts', 'hated', 'Jigsaw', 'wife', 'was', 'annoying', 'had', 'one', 'expression', 'entire', 'movie', 'unrealistic', 'sneer', 'stupid', 'little', 'face.', 'When', 'one', 'cop', 'lady', 'got', 'shot', 'mandible', 'bow', 'arrow', 'two', 'other', 'cops', 'reactions', 'were', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'as', 'startled', 'should', 'be', 'witnessing', 'something', 'so', 'gruesome.', 'general', 'hate', 'how', 'series', 'now', 'gore', 'scare', 'no', 'longer', 'clever', 'writing', 'atmosphere', 'logical', 'traps', 'now', 'just', 'relying', 'showing', 'uncensored', 'dismantling', 'human', 'body', 'creep', 'out.', ""n't"", 'time', 'done', 'away', 'little', 'camera', 'effect', 'use', 'where', 'up', 'panning', '360', 'person/trap', 'then', 'down', ""n't"", 'that', 'just', 'bit', 'old', 'now', 'No', 'guy', 'named', 'Rigg', 'going', 'around', 'trying', 'save', 'everyone-', 'so', 'basically', 'save', 'everyone', 'life', 'kind', 'disposition', 'values', 'drive', 'do', 'yet', 'same', 'guy', 'would', 'put', 'human', 'being', 'TORTURE', 'DEVICE', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'unlucky', 'person', 'was', 'rapist', 'not', ""'m"", 'saying', 'two', 'actions', 'should', 'be', 'mutually', 'exclusive', 'person', 'who', 'sooo', 'blindly', 'caught', 'up', 'having', 'save', 'lives', 'people', 'coming', 'twisted', 'enough', 'knowingly', 'put', 'person', 'device', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'leave', 'significantly', 'lighter', 'several', 'pounds', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'one', 'other', 'not']",N/A

1124657,A2P0L2XE35BYQW,B001053038,"Patt ""Shop4Bliss""","[3, 4]","Saw IV, is quite possibly the worst in the series. Three factors hinder the film: 1) A predictable storyline, 2) Sloppy writing and 3) Mediocre direction. What saved this film is the acting, it was surprisingly a vast improvement over the previous installments. The film is reason alone why the series should conclude. Unfortunately, that is not the case, with the fifth heading our way.Saw IV, is evidence that Hollywood continues to beat a dead horse. The film is nothing more than a cash crop, as the last two have been. The first Saw was groundbreaking for the ""detective thriller"" genre sampling from Se7en another amazingly disturbing film of the same theme. Nearly, everything about the first installment was done correctly right down to the shocking ending that no one could have predicted. Sadly, the same cannot be said about the forth. It offers nothing shocking, interesting or puzzling. The traps were no where near as vicious or thoughtout as the ones featured in the previous films. The ending was boring and left the feeling of ""duh"" in the mind. The film, lacked the degree of depth the others have. But, that is expected seeing how you cannot possibly shock the audience anymore.*spoiler alert*Anyone that watched Saw III's ""Troy Trap"" scene could figure out what's in store for the fourth. I predicted who the next ""Jigsaw"" would be by watching that specific scene. It's so obvious, it angers me that they would actually go that route, but sadly they did. Oh well, such is the film industry. I did not have high hopes for Saw IV, now I even have lower for number V.So, if I hated this movie so much why give it 3 stars? I did not hate it, I merely see it for what it is, the beginning of the end to an otherwise good series. A movie that was made solely to rake in cash and it achieved just that, scoring a place in the number one spot at the box office. And, I'm sure Saw V will do the very same. It achieved its goal, so give the audience what they want, blood and gore. So, one of those stars I gave is strictly because the film served it's purpose. The second star was because the film's writers in their own way, pushed Saw into a different direction. Lastly, the third star was because the movie kept me awake (even though, I did yawn and close my eyes a few times).So, yes the film succeeded where other movies of the same genre fail. Could it have been better? Of course, it could have. Did they really need number IV? Like they needed II & III, not at all. Will I pay to see number V? Yes, only because I'm a true Saw fan.*note*This review has nothing to do with the remarkable Blu-ray format which I am positive will look and sound outstanding.Recommendations: Death Sentence (Saw director, James Wan)",3,SAW should have died with the death of JIGSAW,1200787200,"01 20, 2008",2008,2730,"['Saw', 'IV', 'quite', 'possibly', 'worst', 'series', 'Three', 'factors', 'hinder', 'film', '1', 'predictable', 'storyline', '2', 'Sloppy', 'writing', '3', 'Mediocre', 'direction', 'What', 'saved', 'film', 'acting', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'vast', 'improvement', 'previous', 'installments', 'film', 'reason', 'alone', 'why', 'series', 'should', 'conclude', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'case', 'fifth', 'heading', 'way.Saw', 'IV', 'evidence', 'Hollywood', 'beat', 'dead', 'horse', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'cash', 'crop', 'last', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'Saw', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'detective', 'thriller', 'genre', 'sampling', 'Se7en', 'amazingly', 'disturbing', 'film', 'same', 'theme', 'Nearly', 'everything', 'first', 'installment', 'was', 'done', 'correctly', 'right', 'down', 'shocking', 'ending', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'predicted', 'Sadly', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'forth', 'nothing', 'shocking', 'interesting', 'puzzling', 'traps', 'were', 'where', 'near', 'vicious', 'thoughtout', 'ones', 'featured', 'previous', 'films', 'ending', 'was', 'boring', 'left', 'feeling', 'duh', 'mind', 'film', 'lacked', 'degree', 'depth', 'others', 'have', 'expected', 'seeing', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'shock', 'audience', 'anymore', '*spoiler', 'alert*Anyone', 'watched', 'Saw', 'III', 'Troy', 'Trap', 'scene', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'store', 'fourth', 'predicted', 'who', 'next', 'Jigsaw', 'would', 'be', 'watching', 'specific', 'scene', 'so', 'obvious', 'would', 'actually', 'go', 'route', 'sadly', 'did', 'Oh', 'well', 'such', 'film', 'industry', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'Saw', 'IV', 'now', 'even', 'have', 'lower', 'number', 'V.So', 'hated', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'why', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'did', 'not', 'hate', 'merely', 'see', 'what', 'beginning', 'end', 'otherwise', 'good', 'series', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'solely', 'rake', 'cash', 'achieved', 'just', 'scoring', 'place', 'number', 'one', 'spot', 'box', 'office', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Saw', 'V', 'will', 'do', 'very', 'same', 'achieved', 'goal', 'so', 'give', 'audience', 'what', 'want', 'blood', 'gore', 'So', 'one', 'stars', 'gave', 'strictly', 'film', 'served', 'purpose', 'second', 'star', 'was', 'film', 'writers', 'own', 'way', 'pushed', 'Saw', 'different', 'direction', 'Lastly', 'third', 'star', 'was', 'movie', 'kept', 'awake', 'even', 'did', 'yawn', 'close', 'eyes', 'few', 'times', '.So', 'yes', 'film', 'succeeded', 'where', 'other', 'movies', 'same', 'genre', 'fail', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'course', 'could', 'have', 'Did', 'really', 'need', 'number', 'IV', 'needed', 'II', 'III', 'not', 'Will', 'pay', 'see', 'number', 'V', 'Yes', 'only', ""'m"", 'true', 'Saw', 'fan', '*note*This', 'review', 'nothing', 'do', 'remarkable', 'Blu-ray', 'format', 'am', 'positive', 'will', 'look', 'sound', 'outstanding.Recommendations', 'Death', 'Sentence', 'Saw', 'director', 'James', 'Wan']",N/A

His ultimate test is to learn how to let go and truly save Detective Eric Matthews and Detective Hoffman before 90 minutes. After Rigg tries to save a female pimp from dying, she tries to kill him. Later, Special Agents Strahm and Perez arrive at Rigg's house and try to figure out what is going on. Later, Strahm and Perez visit Jigsaw's ex-wife, Jill Tuck.

When Jigsaw learns that his unborn baby has died, Jigsaw decides to teach Cecil a lesson in the Knife Chair, which is one of my favorite traps!

Watching his lawyer get it in the head is fun enough. We do meet Jigsaw's wife and Jigsaw's first ""test"" subject.The start of the movie is the end by the way. After that, the FBI sends in a couple of agents (the guy has too many quick answers but is likeable). The SWAT commander is tested to see people like Jigsaw does and to test him. But, surprise, the detective is now Jigsaw's new recruit, and he will be tested. By whom? Saw IV's ending sets up Saw V for next Halloween.The new traps get even more complex including the Swat commander's that has no trap; he just has to be patient. The detective from Saw III is still alive and he has to save him by doing Jigsaw's tests on a rapist, a psychopath chick, let a woman kill her husband to get free from his abuse, and not get to his buddy detective too soon.The movie tells us all about Jigsaw and his ex-wife and how it all got started. The next one will obviously introduce a new Jigsaw. I wonder who else Jigsaw trained. It had to be someone since they kept the detective from Saw III alive.The principle thing about the Saw movies is not to take your life for granted and miss out on things, and make people (criminals) no longer able to keep doing their sins. Saw IV didn't make a mistake though: the woman Riggs did rescue could have went to prison instead of getting herself killed.Somehow, Saw IV just got better.

1124664,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001053038,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 2]","Saw IV (Darren Lynn Bousman, 2007)Why oh why do I keep watching the Saw movies? It shouldn't surprise me that, yes, the fourth is markedly worse than the third, and yet it does. Essentially, Darren Lynn Bousman, who's helmed the last three installments while James Wan has been off directing movies that were actually half-decent, seems to have envisioned 2, 3, and 4 as a trilogy. This, of course, explains why so many loose ends were left at the ends of 2 and 3 (though some of them have still floated off into the mist). On the other hand, if you don't have 2 and 3 very fresh in your minds when you see this, you're going to be lost from the get-go, and it's only going to get worse as you go along. So if you must force yourself to watch this movie, I strongly suggest watching 2 and 3 just before you do to refresh your memory. (And you might want to watch the original as well, just to remind yourself that there was, at one point, something worthwhile gong on here.)This episode focuses on Rigg (Lyriq Bent), one of the cops from 2 and 3. This time, it's his game-- he has ninety minutes to get to the end of a maze where he will be able to save two of his co-workers, assuming he makes the right decisions along the way. But given that 3 ended with the deaths of both Jigsaw and Amanda, who's running the game now?Yeah, like all the other Saw movies, the plot's pretty skinny here. But unlike the original, and to a lesser extent the second, there's not even a pretense at characterization-- even for the characters we already know. (This is especially grating given that we get a number of flashbacks to John's pre-Jigsaw life.) This movie puts me in mind of the first victim in Saw 2-- they figured out it was a different killer because there was no point to the killing. It's a sad state of affairs when you can use a plot point in a previous movie to define what's wrong with a later movie in the same franchise.Despite my disappointment, I'll probably end up going to see Saw V later this month. Why? Because Bousman is finally jettisoned (though David Hackl, a Bousman protegee, is probably not going to be much of an improvement, a boy can always hope). * ",2,Just keeps getting worse.,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,2172,"['Saw', 'IV', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', '2007', 'Why', 'oh', 'why', 'do', 'keep', 'watching', 'Saw', 'movies', 'should', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'yes', 'fourth', 'markedly', 'worse', 'third', 'yet', 'Essentially', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'who', 'helmed', 'last', 'three', 'installments', 'James', 'Wan', 'been', 'off', 'directing', 'movies', 'were', 'actually', 'half-decent', 'have', 'envisioned', '2', '3', '4', 'trilogy', 'course', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'were', 'left', 'ends', '2', '3', 'have', 'still', 'floated', 'off', 'mist', 'other', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '2', '3', 'very', 'fresh', 'minds', 'when', 'see', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'lost', 'get-go', 'only', 'going', 'get', 'worse', 'go', 'along', 'So', 'must', 'force', 'watch', 'movie', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'watching', '2', '3', 'just', 'do', 'refresh', 'memory', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'original', 'well', 'just', 'remind', 'was', 'one', 'point', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'gong', 'here', 'episode', 'Rigg', 'Lyriq', 'Bent', 'one', 'cops', '2', '3', 'time', 'game', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'get', 'end', 'maze', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'two', 'co-workers', 'assuming', 'right', 'decisions', 'way', 'given', '3', 'ended', 'deaths', 'Jigsaw', 'Amanda', 'who', 'running', 'game', 'now', 'Yeah', 'other', 'Saw', 'movies', 'plot', 'pretty', 'skinny', 'here', 'original', 'lesser', 'extent', 'second', 'not', 'even', 'pretense', 'characterization', 'even', 'characters', 'already', 'know', 'especially', 'grating', 'given', 'get', 'number', 'flashbacks', 'John', 'pre-Jigsaw', 'life', 'movie', 'mind', 'first', 'victim', 'Saw', '2', 'figured', 'out', 'was', 'different', 'killer', 'was', 'point', 'killing', 'sad', 'state', 'affairs', 'when', 'can', 'use', 'plot', 'point', 'previous', 'movie', 'define', 'what', 'wrong', 'later', 'movie', 'same', 'franchise.Despite', 'disappointment', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'see', 'Saw', 'V', 'later', 'month', 'Why', 'Bousman', 'finally', 'jettisoned', 'David', 'Hackl', 'Bousman', 'protegee', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'much', 'improvement', 'boy', 'can', 'always', 'hope', '*']",N/A

That is horrifying, for 4 was definitely terrible.I mean true Saw 3 wasn't nothing amazing either- but at least it was halfway interesting towards the end. There is nothing interesting to me in Saw 4. The acting was painfully average of course and the storyline keeps getting more and more boring as the sequels keep rolling- but that is nothing new to films such as these. It's really a problem of that even the violent scenes are not shocking. They certainly did not top anything that they did in Saw 3, so it does definitely seem like they've run out of ideas especially when it comes to any more real brutal, squirming-in-seat scenes. Sure, they'll keep trying, but by now I also think we as the movie goers are so used to it that now it's just pretty ho- hum anyway.I mean Saw can hold your interest, just for the fact you wonder how far they went with their imagination this time. But again, have to say if you have seen the very brutal Saw 3- this will be rather disappointing for you.And the ending especially? The most boring part of the film.

The movie starts with the grisly autopsy of John (Tobin Bell).  A tape is found in his stomach, one he made before he died.  Though dead, John does not intend to give up his games.  The next scene is a tasty trap where two men awaken, one with his eyes sewn shut and the other with his mouth sewn shut.  The two are chained together and must get their key off the other man.  As usual, its nice to have a trap right off the bat, don't forget about this one.Lt. Rigg (Lyriq Bent from 'SAW III') is attacked, and finds himself in one of John's games.  He's told that Eric Matthews (surprisingly talented Donny Wahlberg) is still alive after missing for six months, and that Rigg can save him if he follows the rules of the game.  Rigg must follow the clues, many of which the lives of innocent and guilty people are at stake, to his final destination.Added to this SAW installment is John's ex-wife Jill Tuck, called into the police station for interrogation on what she knows of John and his background.  'SAW IV' doesn't quite live up to the first three movies.  The traps are rather lame in comparison to the previous films, and although bloody they just don't have that feel of genius behind them.  John was better as an enigma, with a goal of teaching others to appreciate their lives by putting them into death situations.  (taken from John's cancer and the car crash that almost killed him)  'SAW IV' changes the view of John's motives by providing (IMHO) too much predictable background that takes away from John being a simple genius serial killer.  (You'll have to watch the movie to see the motive changes)  To me, the series lost too much of its complexity along with the mystery that kept the intensity level high.In spite of all this, I still recommend you watch SAW IV, though you must watch the first three in order if you haven't already.  There's adequate blood and gore, some tricky questions of humanity, a decent Jigsaw scenario, and building intensity toward the end.  Rent first unless you're a diehard fan (like me), who purchased before watching the movie.

Nope, the Saw films just aren't like that, and should be applauded for it.Now for my actual review....Jigsaw may be dead, but the audio tape found in his stomach assures us that his work will continue, and everything happening in the movie seems to assure us that it will. SWAT officer Rigg (who first appeared in the 2nd film) is abducted and put into a series of traps that force him to play Jigsaw for a day (make no mistake though, he's not going to become the new apprentice!) so he can save Detective Matthews (first appeared in the 2nd movie) and Detective Hoffman (first appeared in the 3rd movie). FBI Agents Strauhm and Perez follow his game and find clues that lead them back to Jigsaw's ex wife Jill. Jill helps reveal a ton about Jigsaw's past, including what made him evolve into what he is. It's very interesting going back to Jigsaw's past to see him as the successful engineer before he became a moral serial killer.There are 3 other storylines beside's Rigg's game, and all are very compelling. While one is the main focus of the film, it makes you wonder what's going on in the other 3. The movie is very fast-paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat - speaking of which, do NOT turn your head for a second while you're watching this movie. You will miss a lot of vital information if you do. But hey, I guess that's what happens when you try to cram 4 storylines into a little over 90 minutes and succeed in doing so.Saw 4 is, by far, the most complex, intricate, and detailed Saw to date. So many ideas, and so much time manipulation. In fact, Saw 4 also has the most time manipulation and flashbacks out of any Saw. Now of course, the Saw films are notorious for these things; they were since the very first movie. But Saw 4 really takes it to the next level, which of course is welcome. It also has the most police activity out of any Saw as well. Of course, if that's not enough, there is more character stuff in Saw 4 than there was in the others as well! There are some new characters as well as some old ones. There are also some flashbacks which show a lot of previous characters that haven been killed off. If you ask me, it makes the Saw series appear very human and actually plausible. I read an interview with director Darren Lynn Bousman (who also directed 2 and 3) that they're trying to create a world with the movies, to make them appear more realistic. I, for one, think that they do this quite well.One thing that Saw fans will LOVE about Saw 4 is the high amount of twists and revelations that the movie has. There are several twists in almost every scene, which keeps the viewer interested. The Saw films have become well known for the plot twists as well, but WOW! They really outdid themselves here. All of these twists add up to reveal a huge gargantuan revelation at the end that has confused as many people as it's impressed (which I won't spoil).Here's a tip: Do NOT watch Saw 4 BEFORE you watch Saw 3. Not only will you not understand the ending, but it won't be as impressive.... I'm serious.... watching Saw 3 before 4 will help out a TON.Is this the best Saw movie? Well, I can't really say, because my favorite Saw film has kind of been shifting lately. In my review for Saw 3, I ranted about how it was easily my favorite of the series. Looking back, I don't find it as impressive as the other 3 films. I mean, 3 was good, but it was lacking a memorable storyline. It was slow-paced, and the twists at the end didn't really make me say ""WOW what's going to happen next?!?!"" like it did the first time I watched it. But Saw 4 is a great return to form and it's probably the one I've been thinking about the most lately.Now, this was a great movie, but I do have one complaint. Director Darren Lynn Bousman promised us that we would finally know what was in the envelope Amanda read in the 3rd movie that made her freak out. We do get to see a flashback of her opening the envelope, and we also get to see who wrote it (which I won't get into), but we were never shown what was in it! Hopefully the next Saw movie will show usOh, and trust me, there WILL be more Saws. Not only does the ending set up future sequels, but it's already common knowledge among Saw fans that Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) has signed up for 2 more movies. And 5 and 6 are actually being filmed at the same time. Sweet...If you have seen the past Saw films, and you don't mind to ACTUALLY FOLLOW the storyline in the movie, then I highly recommend you go see Saw 4. Another excellent installment in one of the most intelligent horror franchises of all time.__________________________________________________The DVD version of Saw 4 is even better than the theatrical one, and not just because it's unrated. The movie contains scenes that weren't put in the original release. And I don't mean that they're in a deleted scenes section, they are physically put into the movie (although there is one scene under the deleted scenes section). This makes it all the more awesome. And as for Amanda's letter, Darren Lynn Bousman said, in the commentary, that it doesn't matter what's in it, and that all fans need to know is that [one again, I won't spoil who wrote the leteer] wrote the letter, and the fans ought to intrepret what it says (I guess he's been getting a lot of flak from fans... ha ha). And, you have to admit, the fact that a person other than Jigsaw wrote it definitely changes the way you think about the letter.This is highly recommended to any and all Saw fans.",5,Another strong installment in the Saw series.

1124677,ASR6EDD3ES7JW,B001053038,SteakSalad101,"[13, 17]","Who would've thought that a slasher horror film franchise, after three sequels, could STILL be one of the best things Hollywood has to boast today? Not I, that's for sure. The intricate, original, crowd pleasing, absolutely shocking, riveting, suspenseful ""Saw"" wowed audiences in 2004 and a very solid sequel did the same in 2005.I still remember seeing Saw and Saw II for the first time and realizing how amazing they were. Yet, I was unhappy with Saw III along with many others for reasons being: it focused more on violence than plot, there was no twist, and the ending was very unsatisfying.I know for a fact I wasn't the only person who thought the ""Saw"" franchise was officially over, judging by the very disappointing third film...yet, I still possessed a strange love for these films and couldn't wait to see the fourth when it hit theaters. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece at all...but I got one.""Saw IV"" is not the average horror flick. If you're a Saw fan that likes the series for its blood and guts, you're going to despise it. If you're not willing to completely concentrate on the film's every little detail, you're going to despise it. If you feel like just kicking back, watching a nice gory horror film, and not spending a night analyzing the film, racking your brain until you drive yourself insane, you're going to despise this film. Quite honestly, that's why so many people hate this film: because they were expecting something completely different. Make no mistake--the Saw franchise as we know it is now going in a completely different direction.Here's where the line's drawn between Saw IV and it's predecessors. With the deaths of two main characters in Saw III, you can't possibly think of how Saw IV could really be close to a decent film. Instead of a basic storyline of traps, unlucky individuals who don't appreciate their lives, and suspenseful jump scenes, Saw IV delivers a completely different premise: it's darker, edgier, scarier, more complex, more intricately designed, and more controversial than its predecessors. In some ways, the most horrifying thing about the film is instead of watching people being tested on screen--YOU, as a viewer, are tested--challenged to see what Jigsaw sees, feel what Jigsaw feels...judge how Jigsaw judges. The traps aren't there to entertain, or to make you recoil in disgust...they're there to make you THINK.Even if you don't want to, or don't feel like it, Saw IV will whisk you away into a land of nightmare where you're forced to make the choices to what happens to the individuals on screen--you're the one in control. By the end of the movie, you'll be so shaken up you won't be able to move. For me, this one ""Saw IV"" HUGE points because it's actually scary, unlike II and III! It's not a body-count movie--it's a riveting, mind-boggling psychological thriller in the sense of the first film. The film feels like it balances a huge amount of plot and story and a huge amount of gore and ends up taking the cake. The film is exceptionally, brutally violent (even more so than Saw III) and some scenes are very, very disturbing--not because they are violent, but because stuff so horrifying is happening you just want to vomit your brains out. Saw IV is NOT for the faint of heart and there is some very disturbing sexual violence in one scene and another massively disturbing scene where five people in my theater got up and left...and this scene has haunted me since I came out of my theater.Though horror veterans James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the original creators of Saw, did not write Saw IV--it almost seems better. Darren Lynn Bousman's exquisite directing incorporates a dire sense of urgency throughout the whole film, making it feel like you're watching a ""24"" episode.I will warn you now the ending will confuse the hell out of you, which apparently is another reason for people to completely, wrongly condemn this film. Me and my friends spent a good two hours discussing the film afterwards and it made much more sense to us. Be prepared to watch this film with an open mind and be ready for some serious post-viewing discussion afterwards. The ending is very much like that of ""The Prestige,"" and you may have a desire to watch ""Saw IV"" again the minute it ends.If you're a Saw fan that was disappointed with the lack of psychological horror in Saw II and Saw III---fear not. Saw IV has what you're looking for and will take you to hell and back...but hold onto your dinner. I have no idea how this film made it past the MPAA without an NC-17 rating. Along with your dinner, try to hold onto your sanity while watching the film...good luck with that.Enjoy which, is in my opinion, one of the best treats of the 2007 movie season.",5,"Riveting and mind

1124678,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B001053038,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[6, 8]","In many ways, it's hard to reach a definitive verdict on the level of ""Saw IV"" until the fifth chapter comes out this October; Saw IV, much more so than any of its predecessors, felt like it didn't so much actually end, as it paused for a year-long intermission.  The series has become very complicated (too much for so some, although I'm loving the increasingly labyrithine structure) and just as it hits a major revelation that makes it clear what's been happening in this chapter, the end credits roll, seemingly with so much poised to start taking place.  Saw III ended on a cliffhanger like ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Saw IV's strange non-ending is more like the finale to ""Matrix Reloaded"".The stage was all set at the end of Saw III for Jigsaw's final game, but rather than delve fully into that angle, the movie brings back some previously minor characters (some major ones, too, but it's previously 'bit' players who end up with a surprising lions share of the focus here) and greatly expands their role in the whole series through a non-linear storyline that goes through several time frames.  The origin of Jigsaw and his previously briefly-touched-on relationship with his ex-wife Jill are also expanded in flashbacks, and we see the very early, simple deathtraps constructed by Jigsaw at the beginning of his 'career'.  How well this will ultimately mesh with everything from the first three is still partially up in the air; they didn't foul it up here, but Saw V is going to have to be very tight to tie everything together fully - not just events but the different characterizations of Jigsaw and the others as they've progressed and changed.Lyriq Bent's character of Rigg gets turned into a much more central character this time around, having been personally selected by Jigsaw to be put through a wringer of tests designed to force him to make choices between risking the lives of the innocent characters he's searching for, or allowing those already judged guilty by Jigsaw to die along the way.  The immediate question people will ask is how can the games continue after Saw III's rather definitive endscene, but things have been organized well in advance; the much greater use of flashbacks also opens up possibilities.It was a risk to deliberately complicate things so much this far into an already highly involved series, but this is in keeping with the series.  The first Saw was great but it was questionable from the beginning whether it should spawn even one sequel, let alone a long-running series.  Each new chapter though, has not only succeeded but gotten more complex, deeper, and has enriched the films that came before it.  Often even more intense too, and Saw IV is probably the goriest chapter yet.  It's left a lot more unresolved than the previous ones (and requires even closer attention to understand); despite its status where I may not be 100% sure how this will ultimately hold up once the storylines it launched play out in Saw V, I'm still going to go with a 5-star rating.  First of all, there's no way that, however Saw V turns out, that this will rate less than a four, or probably four-and-a-half star rating - regardless of how a sequel plays into its successors and predecessors it still has to be judged primarily on its own merits.  For that little bit of doubt, the series has earned the benefit of the doubt: thus far everything they do keeps doing justice to the earlier ones, and I suspect (and hope) the next entry will do the same.And even if it doesn't, Saw IV succeeded on a difficult track.  It could have been great without adding these new angles to the mix, but apparantly they thought these angles were worth exploring, so in they came and the risk payed off.

I actually liked I-III, thought IV sucked, and just finished V.Saw V is like watching Law & Order: you know exactly how it will start, who's involved, and how it will end. There will be an introductory mutilation involving some complex piece of machinery and some poor sap/s who have to listen to Jigsaw's contradictory philosophy. Then it moves into the core, where more are mutilated in increasingly ingenious ways with increasingly complicated machinery and in increasingly larger rooms. At the end they do a rewind to put it all together and to let you know it's not over yet, boys and girls - Saw's just getting started.As I watched V (and I and II and III), I kept wondering how the hell Jigsaw did it. Even with his accomplice/s it would be near impossible to plan these joyous affairs. Where did he get the money, the locations, the materials, the cool red and black playboy robe? Silly, but I know the point is not pointing out Saw's holes. Enjoying the sight of people suffering are the real draw. Seriously, the violence is NC-17 but somehow escapes that rating.And finally, Jigsaw's motives for creating this danse macabre become weaker and weaker as the series continues. So the guy's fiancee had a miscarriage. That's it? No being molested as a child, being raped as a teen, having a mother who rode a unicycle naked to work? This is not the motive of a killer (although Jigs keeps saying he never killed anyone). Killers are cooked in a cauldron of the most f'd up stuff imaginable.Despite my opinion, Saw V's all right, just spread a bit too thin now.",2,Getting sillier and sillier,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,1666,"['Snuff', 'movies', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'ai', ""n't"", 'thing', 'have', 'time', 'kill', 'now', ""'m"", 'work', 'actually', 'liked', 'I-III', 'thought', 'IV', 'sucked', 'just', 'finished', 'V.Saw', 'V', 'watching', 'Law', 'Order', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'will', 'start', 'who', 'involved', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'introductory', 'mutilation', 'involving', 'complex', 'piece', 'machinery', 'poor', 'sap/s', 'who', 'have', 'listen', 'Jigsaw', 'contradictory', 'philosophy', 'Then', 'core', 'where', 'more', 'are', 'mutilated', 'increasingly', 'ingenious', 'ways', 'increasingly', 'complicated', 'machinery', 'increasingly', 'larger', 'rooms', 'end', 'do', 'rewind', 'put', 'together', 'let', 'know', 'not', 'yet', 'boys', 'girls', 'Saw', 'just', 'getting', 'started.As', 'watched', 'V', 'II', 'III', 'kept', 'wondering', 'how', 'hell', 'Jigsaw', 'did', 'Even', 'accomplice/s', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'plan', 'joyous', 'affairs', 'Where', 'did', 'get', 'money', 'locations', 'materials', 'cool', 'red', 'black', 'playboy', 'robe', 'Silly', 'know', 'point', 'not', 'pointing', 'out', 'Saw', 'holes', 'Enjoying', 'sight', 'people', 'suffering', 'are', 'real', 'draw', 'Seriously', 'violence', 'NC-17', 'somehow', 'escapes', 'rating.And', 'finally', 'Jigsaw', 'motives', 'creating', 'danse', 'become', 'weaker', 'weaker', 'series', 'guy', 'fiancee', 'had', 'miscarriage', 'No', 'being', 'molested', 'child', 'being', 'raped', 'teen', 'having', 'mother', 'who', 'rode', 'unicycle', 'naked', 'work', 'not', 'motive', 'killer', 'Jigs', 'saying', 'never', 'killed', 'anyone', 'Killers', 'are', 'cooked', 'cauldron', 'most', 'f', ""'d"", 'up', 'stuff', 'imaginable.Despite', 'opinion', 'Saw', 'V', 'right', 'just', 'spread', 'bit', 'too', 'thin', 'now']",N/A

Jigsaw is not as centric as in the other films. He is in flashbacks not real time in the movie. The flashbacks show what made Jigsaw who he is, but it cuts down on the suspense.

1124683,A3J9VNYN00CON7,B001053038,TamaDrummer,"[0, 1]","The Saw series certainly has its mixed bag of reviews.  For those who come to see anything different from the first 3 films wont really find TOO much new  here.  For those who DO love or like the series should appreciate Saw 4 for what it is.  I saw this film in theaters 3 times and loved every second of it.  What makes Saw 4 a little different is that it walks away from the over the top gore to actually having much more story and twice the drama.  Not to mention the best acting of the series yet.The Saw series is built upon more than just gore and torture scenes. All four films have a great back story and moral lesson so to speak to go along with its gore and violence.  If you haven't liked any of the Saw movies before this, please don't go watching this thinking it will change your mind because it wont.  It is still very much Saw, but with more drama and much better acting.  This sets Saw 4 apart from the series a little bit. I personally think the Saw series has some of the better acting I have seen in a Horror/Suspense series.  As stated above, the film tones down its gore a little.  In doing so it relies on its story.  Thats my favorite factor of the film is the story.  It never lets up.  Certainly as good as the first as far as story and script goes. This is where I feel Saw 2 let me down a little was its too simple story.  Along with a better script then one might think, the acting is certainly the best yet.  Tobin Bell is once again the man.  He gives the John Kramer character charm and depth here...as usual.  Scott Patterson is also a breath of fresh air into the series.  He plays his character extremely well, giving it his all.  Costas Mandylor works with what little was given to him and I thought he came off as cool as ice.Director Bousman clearly has energy and passion for these films, but I can tell it seems he was getting a little tired.  The man has directed 3 of these movies and I feel that showed a little.  By no means does it take away from the film, but the directing for Saw 3 was his best work yet.  The score and photography are done perfectly well... as usual for the series.  Cool shots  throughout the whole movie.  I still believe Saw 3 beat the film here because its photography was flat out awesome.  The score was underplayed at times, but still quite good.For those seeking the beauty of gore can find it here though.  There is still the fair amount of gore and blood that many fans crave.  The autopsy scene at the beginning of this movie is so sweet.  I cringed a little.  Very cool.  The traps were too perfect.  I liked them better than those of Saw 2 and was pretty much on par with Saw 3.  The scalping scene with the hooker was so incredibly great one can't describe.  So yeah, the gore hound can find something here to like as well.All and all I rank this high in the Saw series.  I loved it for what it was and not for what it wasn't.  Some fans want the original all over again and some want Saw 2 all the time.  I feel each film can stand on its own.  Saw 4 is no different.  It's a Saw film and has many of the great factors of the past movies and takes a few turns with them.  A true Saw fan can find something they at least like here.  I knew at some point the series would have to up the scale story wise; they did it here and I adore it.  I personally cant wait for Saw 5 to answer a few questions left by Saw 4.  If you loved the past films then I highly recommend this awesome flick.

While I can't divulge just why the movie ups the ante, just suffice to say that, with Jigsaw dead, this movie takes place begining in the moments before the awful scene at the end of number 3 (and other info deleted to appease other Amazon crybabies).You are also given a deeper back-story for Jigsaw, (Tobin Bell, again deliciously malevolent) and the lady that appeared in his flashbacks. Other characthers reappear as pawns in a dangerous game, as the dearly departed seems to have left posthumous recruitment tapes for SWAT Commander Rigg. Along with the typical ominous warnings, Rigg is led through the well-known series of SAW traps as Jigsaw tests his mettle. At the end of this test are two other fellow officers, including a returning Donnie Wahlberg, restrained to another nefarious device. As you can guess, not everything goes according to plan. The final twist is a doozy, and for a change, hard to see coming.The script, which plays out more like a mystery/whodunit than a horror show, is what really bumps this movie up.

The fact that Saw IV was released proves otherwise. After an autopsy on Jigsaw's body a tape is found in his stomach. The micro-cassette is then given to Detective Mark Hoffman in which Jigsaw told him not to think he will be left untested and that the games are not over just because he's dead. This movie's game tests Lieutenant Riggs who remains convinced that Eric Matthews (Saw II) is not dead (in this Saw we watch his fate as well). Saw IV provides plenty of flashback to explain past events as we learn how Jigsaw first started the ""games"", his motivations, the first trap he made and more. Best of all it makes sense and provides logic which is not provided in many horror movies that tend to ignore this. It opens the doors for what's next to come in Saw while at the same it reveals the story's origins.Some may think of it as not a real Saw but rather a 3.5 but I disagree, it has its own story and they probably say this because of the flashbacks. I felt this Saw was a transition from the first three movies to the future of the series. I think the transition was well made and that despite not being one of the best Saw movies it's still a very good one that is surely worth it.

This one is a little hard to follow unless you watch the 3rd one just before this one. The reason is this one covers the past and present of the series. The twist at the end was pretty good too. The test storyline is pretty good too-but I won't tell it right now. More of Jsaws past is revealed as well, but the twist you'll have to figure out on your own.August 8, 2010At the beginning-spoilers ahead!! Surgeons do an autopsy on Jigsaw's body even though it's rather obvious what killed him. They cut him open completely and find something in his stomache...hmmm. This film plays out during the events of Saw 3. The goriness of this was a little more graphic than I expected and in this chapter the test subjects-you aren't really sure how to label them: victims or villians themselves. The hotel and classroom scene traps were very cringe-worthy but clever. The ending was a little confusing, this one you have to watch a few times to catch all the storylines-plus there's more than one twist. In fact there are several, and you get the idea of how Jsaw was pushed to the breaking point here, and even further in part 6 Officer Rigg from Saw 2 and 3 is thrust into a game where faces his obsession of losing friends, and trying to save them.

1124692,A6T5QGOZ70BJ7,B001053038,"Vandalgal2006 ""musicaladybug""","[0, 0]","Here we have the fourth installment of the Saw movies. If you have not watched the previous three, please do so before watching this one, or else it will be extremely confusing. Although a prequel in many ways, ""Saw IV"" also ties in with ""Saw III,"" thus continuing the chain. I've had to watch this one a few times before actually being able to absorb everything that happened. ""Saw IV"" makes you think and analyze a lot more than the previous movies because there are so many flashbacks from past to present and so many twists, that it can boggle the mind. But once you wade through everything mentally, you'll find that ""Saw IV"" is a brilliant horror film complete with a decent storyline, plenty of gore and new traps. There is so much going on in this film that I'll try to break it down as best I can.John Kramer/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dead, and we get to see a rather graphic autopsy performed on his body. A tape is found in John's stomach to which Lt. Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) plays and hears the chilling voice of Jigsaw. The things he says are truly epic for this film. We saw Lt. Hoffman for a short time in ""Saw III"" and now he's one of the most important characters for ""Saw IV."" It's not long before Hoffman is seemingly kidnapped by someone in the notorious pig mask (the story behind the pig mask will be revealed too) that we've seen in the previous movies.The movie also revolves around Lt. Daniel Rigg (Lyriq Bent). Like Hoffman, he's appeared in the previous film as well, and now his character takes a giant leap into the spotlight. After finding Detective Allison Kerry (Dina Meyer) dead, it is clear that Rigg is the last man standing, as everyone has kept dying around him. Rigg has become obsessed with saving everyone, which will soon become part of the new Jigsaw game he will be put into. After being attacked in his own home, Rigg wakes up to find out on a t.v. screen that Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is still alive, even after being missing for 6 months. He is hanging by his neck, hands shackled, his feet balancing on a huge block of slowly melting ice. Next to Matthews is Hoffman, gagged and bound to a chair that's near water. Their fates are linked together and the ice block and chair are like a balance. If Matthews steps off the block of ice, the chair that Hoffman is sitting in will sink down into water from the melted ice, which is hooked to high voltage and will electrocute him.Rigg has but 90 minutes to go through a series of tests in order to save Matthews and Hoffman. Will Rigg trust the people in the traps to fend for themselves, or will his obsession to save everybody make matters worse? It starts with his test called ""See What I See,"" where there is a shady woman named Brenda whose hair is twisted in the gears of a device. Then he meets up with a convicted rapist named Ivan for the ""Feel What I Feel"" test where he must give up his eyes or face deadly consequences. Rigg then finds the abusive husband and his wife linked together with long steel spikes piercing through both their bodies in the ""Save As I Save"" trap. Rigg will then at last reach his final test where the climatic ending unfolds.Along the way, we're introduced to some new people in the movie who make a huge impact. FBI agents Peter Strahm (Scott Patterson) and Lindsey Perez (Athena Karkanis) are hot on the case with a key and a note they obtained from Kerry before she died that says ""Open the door and you will find me."" While investigating, Perez and and Strahm come across a trap of their own in the form of ""Billy,"" the infamous laughing Jigsaw doll that has appeared in the other films. This time around, Billy is no ordinary laughing doll, as agent Perez will find out. We're also introduced to Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell), John Kramer's ex-wife, who has been relentlessly interrogated about John in the past. Strahm is now the latest person to interrogate Jill about her own possible involvement in the crimes, and of course about John. Through Jill Tuck's flashbacks, we are told the back story of John Kramer and how he became who he was, from his grieving moments over the loss of his unborn son, to his first test with a soulless hustler and thief named Cecil, who gets a dose of a knife mask and a trip into some razor wire. Finally, we get to meet Art Blank (Louis Ferreira) the attorney who is linked to John as well as the people in the latest traps. He too has played a game of his own during the first part of the film where he's in a room with his lips sewn shut. Another man in there with him has his eyes sewn shut. The trap is called the mausoleum. The two men are chained by their necks to either side of the device, which keeps pulling them towards the machine. One man has the key to unlock their chains, and it turns out to be a rather violent struggle between the two men. Art has a significant role in the game that Matthews and Hoffman are playing during the movie as well.The ending left my jaw dropping. Everything happens so fast and is so unexpected. It will definitely leave you surprised; very unique twists and an ultra-intense ""Final Test"" scene with Matthews, Hoffman, Rigg and Art. The film ties all the ends together in a very different way at the end. ""Saw IV"" is the ""thinkers"" Saw film, and after viewing it for the first time, you could very well ask yourself: ""What the hell just happened?!"" I know I did. Solid acting as always from Tobin Bell, and I was impressed by the supporting actors/actresses as well. Overall an intense, gory ride.

1124695,A5X1B2HBQUR3P,B001053038,"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn""","[2, 3]","A bold movie just for the fans. A top reviewer said to the effect that to understand saw4, you need to eat a lot of fish the previous night and see all the previous films in order and then walk into the theater to see saw4. No doubt SAW4 is for the the fans. I am amazed at how Lionsgate has had the guts to care about narative continuity and episodic sequence in a major hollywood movie. Most horror movie franchise base themselves on producing movies which have the same recurrent theme but try to keep each movie as a standalone story so as to increase its marketability. Obviously Lionsgate is sure that the saw franchise fan following will see them through by bringing in the saw fans. There is no doubt that a non-saw fan who has not yet seen saw2 and saw3 will understand squat in the movie. It is interesting to note that the makers of the film expect you to actually remember what happened in saw3 which we probably saw a year ago. Because saw4 refers to a lot of details, situations and characters who were introduced from saw3 onwards, you need have seen saw3 last year and saw3  again on DVD now and refresh your memory before going into saw4. You may get by not seeing saw2 but seeing saw3 is a mandatory absolute prerequiste before watching saw4, that is if you want to understand what the hell is happening on the screen. I won't say too much about the traps and detailed story line. We all know what  a SAW film will be about and what to expect. Giving away the traps will reduce the surprises in the film, the very core and  the uniquenness of the saw series relies on the inventive ways in which people are made to kill themselves. The traps in saw4 are tame compared to the traps in saw3. A fantastic autopsy shot of jigsaw sets the tone of the saw4 movie and sucks us into the saw universe. A surprise ending is in store, which only the saw fans will be able to understand. Those who did not see saw3 will leave the theaters scratching their heads because they would be thinking ""Jeez I didn't get the film and I didn't get the ending"".I've also written reviews on saw2 and 3 (a bit more extensive on the story than I do here). It can be found in read in ""see all  my reviews"" section.I'm hanging on to the SAW ride till the end. I'm ready for SAW5 and SAW6 which have been announced. And I love the SAW theme music, the way it plays at the very end of every film before our saw apprentices close the door on our victims....""You think it's over, but the games have just begun""...you bet.regards, Vikram",4,WARNING: You don't want to watch this one without seeing saw3,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,2522,"['bold', 'movie', 'just', 'fans', 'top', 'reviewer', 'said', 'effect', 'understand', 'saw4', 'need', 'eat', 'lot', 'fish', 'previous', 'night', 'see', 'previous', 'films', 'order', 'then', 'walk', 'theater', 'see', 'saw4', 'doubt', 'SAW4', 'fans', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', 'Lionsgate', 'had', 'guts', 'care', 'narative', 'continuity', 'episodic', 'sequence', 'major', 'hollywood', 'movie', 'Most', 'horror', 'movie', 'franchise', 'base', 'producing', 'movies', 'have', 'same', 'recurrent', 'theme', 'try', 'keep', 'movie', 'standalone', 'story', 'so', 'increase', 'marketability', 'Obviously', 'Lionsgate', 'sure', 'saw', 'franchise', 'fan', 'following', 'will', 'see', 'bringing', 'saw', 'fans', 'doubt', 'non-saw', 'fan', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'saw2', 'saw3', 'will', 'understand', 'squat', 'movie', 'interesting', 'note', 'makers', 'film', 'expect', 'actually', 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'saw3', 'probably', 'saw', 'year', 'ago', 'saw4', 'refers', 'lot', 'details', 'situations', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'introduced', 'saw3', 'onwards', 'need', 'have', 'seen', 'saw3', 'last', 'year', 'saw3', 'again', 'DVD', 'now', 'refresh', 'memory', 'going', 'saw4', 'may', 'get', 'not', 'seeing', 'saw2', 'seeing', 'saw3', 'mandatory', 'absolute', 'prerequiste', 'watching', 'saw4', 'want', 'understand', 'what', 'hell', 'happening', 'screen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'traps', 'detailed', 'story', 'line', 'know', 'what', 'SAW', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'about', 'what', 'expect', 'Giving', 'away', 'traps', 'will', 'reduce', 'surprises', 'film', 'very', 'core', 'uniquenness', 'saw', 'series', 'relies', 'inventive', 'ways', 'people', 'are', 'made', 'kill', 'traps', 'saw4', 'are', 'tame', 'compared', 'traps', 'saw3', 'A', 'fantastic', 'autopsy', 'shot', 'jigsaw', 'tone', 'saw4', 'movie', 'sucks', 'saw', 'universe', 'surprise', 'ending', 'store', 'only', 'saw', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'saw3', 'will', 'leave', 'theaters', 'scratching', 'heads', 'would', 'be', 'thinking', 'Jeez', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'ending', '.I', ""'ve"", 'also', 'written', 'saw2', '3', 'bit', 'more', 'extensive', 'story', 'do', 'here', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'read', 'see', 'reviews', 'section.I', ""'m"", 'hanging', 'SAW', 'ride', 'till', 'end', ""'m"", 'ready', 'SAW5', 'SAW6', 'have', 'been', 'announced', 'love', 'SAW', 'theme', 'music', 'way', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'saw', 'apprentices', 'close', 'door', 'victims', 'think', 'over', 'games', 'have', 'just', 'begun', 'bet.regards', 'Vikram']",N/A

This movie was by far the worst of the franchise.  The first 15 minutes were grusome and gave me the feeling this movie was going to be on par with the first three movies that I loved.  I was wrongthe movie got confusing fast and just seemed to drag to a finish.  This movie would surpass most current horror movies and compared to other films of this type I would give it a 5 star, however compared to the other 3 Saw movies this one by far inferior.
