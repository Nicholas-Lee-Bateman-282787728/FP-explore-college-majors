A disjointed dog-log of a ""film"" about (what else) a guy and his hippie friends who inherit a ranch. An old caretaker soon tells the tale of the headless horseman and his curse, which (supposedly) brings about the deaths of a few of the fuzzy young people. Unfortunately, this is all shot through a home-movie camera by someone who must have seen MANOS and said, ""Wow! Now THAT'S a movie!""

This stinker actually forced me to challenge my convictions concerning the worst movie of all time; Curse of the Headless Horseman is easily - easily - among the worst three films ever made.  I mean, this movie makes you want to gouge your eyes out and swallow a bottle of Clorox.  Your mind can hardly handle the experience because the film is just so bad in every way possible.  With one of our own churning out a bomb like this, you start to question whether humanity really deserves to exist after all.Where do I even begin?  Well, for starters, the audio and video quality of the whole thing is just awful.  The fact that Kirtman obviously forbade his cast from doing more than one take of any scene didn't help.  Actors flub lines left and right, several of them can't walk more than four or five feet without tripping, most of the night scenes were shot during the middle of the afternoon, you can hear a phone ringing off-camera at one point, a few lines were delivered so far away from the microphone you can barely hear them (actually, that might be a good thing), and someone gets the brilliant idea of playing around with red, green, and blue filters somewhere along the way.  Most of the music in the film was apparently supplied by a cat walking up and down the keys of a piano.  The acting - folks, these kids are the worst actors I've ever seen in my life.  Not one of them could act his/her way out of a dark room with a flashlight (I have my doubts that many of them could find their way out of a brightly lit room with the door wide open, actually).  Special effects?  Puh - lease.  I've seen little kids make papier mache heads that looked more lifelike than the horseman's head in this movie.  Oh, and did I mention the fact that this really annoying narrator keeps turning up to pontificate over aspects of the whole headless horseman thing?Please, I beg of you, don't even think about associating the name of Washington Irving with anything about this film.  I think one of the writers of the Scooby Doo mysteries dropped some LSD or something and came up with this plot.  Guy inherits ranch (ranch, of course, means pitiful, broken-down wild west tourist attraction), has to turn a profit in six months or lose everything, brings hippie friends with him, hears ridiculous tale about a headless horseman from creepy caretaker; said horseman shows up; friends trip and start dying; ""shocking"" conclusion; end credits.  That's basically it - and as bad as my little summary sounds, the movie itself is exponentially worse.  Words can't even describe how thoroughly awful this movie is.",1,Thoroughly awful to the nth degree,1132272000,"11 18, 2005",2005,2744,"['changed', 'name', 'started', 'making', 'adult', 'films', 'Leonard', 'Kirtman', 'defecated', 'cow', 'pie', 'cinematic', 'putrescence', 'world', 'stinker', 'actually', 'forced', 'challenge', 'convictions', 'concerning', 'worst', 'movie', 'time', 'Curse', 'Headless', 'Horseman', 'easily', 'easily', 'worst', 'three', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'mean', 'movie', 'want', 'gouge', 'eyes', 'out', 'swallow', 'bottle', 'Clorox', 'mind', 'can', 'hardly', 'handle', 'experience', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'bad', 'way', 'possible', 'one', 'own', 'churning', 'out', 'bomb', 'start', 'question', 'humanity', 'really', 'exist', 'all.Where', 'do', 'even', 'begin', 'Well', 'starters', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'awful', 'fact', 'Kirtman', 'obviously', 'forbade', 'cast', 'doing', 'more', 'one', 'take', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'Actors', 'flub', 'lines', 'left', 'right', 'several', 'ca', ""n't"", 'walk', 'more', 'four', 'five', 'feet', 'tripping', 'most', 'night', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'middle', 'afternoon', 'can', 'hear', 'phone', 'ringing', 'off-camera', 'one', 'point', 'few', 'lines', 'were', 'delivered', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'microphone', 'can', 'barely', 'hear', 'actually', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'someone', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'playing', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'filters', 'somewhere', 'way', 'Most', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'apparently', 'supplied', 'cat', 'walking', 'up', 'keys', 'piano', 'acting', 'folks', 'kids', 'are', 'worst', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'Not', 'one', 'could', 'act', 'way', 'dark', 'room', 'flashlight', 'have', 'doubts', 'many', 'could', 'find', 'way', 'brightly', 'lit', 'room', 'door', 'wide', 'open', 'actually', 'Special', 'effects', 'Puh', 'lease', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'little', 'kids', 'make', 'papier', 'mache', 'heads', 'looked', 'more', 'lifelike', 'horseman', 'head', 'movie', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'fact', 'really', 'annoying', 'narrator', 'keeps', 'turning', 'up', 'pontificate', 'over', 'aspects', 'whole', 'headless', 'horseman', 'thing', 'Please', 'beg', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'associating', 'name', 'Washington', 'Irving', 'anything', 'film', 'think', 'one', 'writers', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'mysteries', 'dropped', 'LSD', 'something', 'came', 'up', 'plot', 'Guy', 'ranch', 'ranch', 'course', 'pitiful', 'broken-down', 'wild', 'west', 'tourist', 'attraction', 'turn', 'profit', 'six', 'months', 'lose', 'everything', 'hippie', 'friends', 'ridiculous', 'tale', 'headless', 'horseman', 'creepy', 'caretaker', 'said', 'horseman', 'up', 'friends', 'trip', 'start', 'dying', 'shocking', 'conclusion', 'end', 'credits', 'basically', 'as', 'bad', 'little', 'summary', 'sounds', 'movie', 'exponentially', 'worse', 'Words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'describe', 'how', 'thoroughly', 'awful', 'movie']",N/A

847667,A5HTN7UMHVHHG,B0002W4SDQ,"M. Salmestrelli ""larddiet""","[0, 0]","For my money, this is the worst movie ever made. I've seen Creeping Terror, Manos, Monster A GoGo, the Coleman Francis Trilogy and most of Ray Dennis Steckler's films (including some of his softcore flicks). I STILL think the Curse of the Headless Horseman is the worst movie ever made.For one thing, the dialogue is hard to hear. I do hear the narration which would be moderately evocative in a different setting (also if the voice didn't sound like it was on the Monster Mash song).The picture quality is bad and while I admit to have seen a poor cheap transfer of the movie, there is no way this film would benefit from having a clean print. If anything, lousy picture quality almost helps give this movie a creepy horror feel which it fails to deliver on its own.What makes this movie on par with your average Coleman Francis movie is the script. The narration opens with an explanation of the ranch and hints at the fact that something horrible happened to the owner (only clothes identified him, closed casket). The movie leaves it at that and it ties the potential murder to no one.Another problem with the script is that there are no likable characters. NONE.  I found myself rooting for the creepy old caretaker, Solomon. As the story develops...I mean as the movie continues, only three characters develop any kind of personality. That ruins the suspense when it comes time for the big reveal in the end. Everyone else in the movie (could call it an ensemble cast) just is there on the screen. No time is spent to develop their characters and not hearing the dialog well ruins the feeble attempts of when they are. In the end, you don't care who they are, you never really learn their names and you know in the end that it won't matter if you did know more about them anyway.One of the characters that come across is a guy named John who is introduced to the audience as a hothead at a party and later in what looks to be a brutal rape scene which some of the supposed ""good guys"" sit back and enjoy watching. The relationship between John and this woman isn't established by that time in the movie and you're left thinking that apparently she wanted to be ravaged by the creep because she ends up being with him later. None of their backstory is explained so you assume what you see is an ugly rape scene and the faceless characters sit back and watch with approving smiles on their faces.The other characters are basically Mark and Solomon, surrounded by unidentified hippies. This is fine and dandy except when characters are being killed off, you don't care because they're nondescript. You know absolutely nothing about them. Two fo the victims have no lines in the movie, NONE.To say most of the cast is completely nondescript is an understatement. This is an incredible thing because they're in scenes. These scenes tell nothing in terms of story and they say nothing about the character's themselves. Is that possible? Normally, no but it does happen here.People toward the end are killed while ARMED men out to stop the violence sit back and let it happen. This happens twice. After the murder, death and mayhem, the other characters engage in leisurely conversation, joking with each other as though they didn't care. They also seem to enjoy hanging around the ranch after all this happens.The only time the nameless ensemble cast of characters care about what happens is at the end for the big reveal. With only one developed character left, you can guess how big the reveal is. Also the menace of this ultimate villain is undercut by his excellent Don Knotts impersonation (seeThe Shakiest Gun in the Westfor reference) during his kill crazy rampage (he steals the gun off another guy but just happens to have pocket full of bullets that fit so that he can reload)I'm willing to excuse poor fight choreography and bad special effects because this is about as low budget as it gets. Even willing to ignore the fact that this is clearly not set on a ranch; it clearly was never a town which became a 'ghost town', but is what it looks like, an amusement park.What is not excusable is the script. It is filled with loathsomeness , stupid plot twists and clunkers for actors puts this at the bottom among the worst things ever released. I enjoyed the song in the closing credits, the way over the top caretaker Solomon (not sure if he dies or not; you get a feeling that what happened to him isn't taken very seriously by anyone; not sure if Solomon tries to save the second victim or not because the narration says ""He tried to save her"" without identifying who ""He"" is. The camera is on Solomon during this so I assume it's him? Is Solomon the nearest thing this dog of a film comes to a hero?) and the repeated line ""IT WILL BEGIN AGAIN""I imagine if the Manson family made a movie, it would be exactly like this.",1,"Highlights are the ending credits and....""It will begin AGAIN""",1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,4833,"['money', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Creeping', 'Terror', 'Manos', 'Monster', 'A', 'GoGo', 'Coleman', 'Francis', 'Trilogy', 'most', 'Ray', 'Dennis', 'Steckler', 'films', 'including', 'softcore', 'flicks', 'STILL', 'think', 'Curse', 'Headless', 'Horseman', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'one', 'thing', 'dialogue', 'hard', 'hear', 'do', 'hear', 'narration', 'would', 'be', 'moderately', 'evocative', 'different', 'setting', 'also', 'voice', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'was', 'Monster', 'Mash', 'song', '.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'bad', 'admit', 'have', 'seen', 'poor', 'cheap', 'transfer', 'movie', 'way', 'film', 'would', 'benefit', 'having', 'clean', 'print', 'anything', 'lousy', 'picture', 'quality', 'almost', 'give', 'movie', 'creepy', 'horror', 'feel', 'deliver', 'own.What', 'movie', 'par', 'average', 'Coleman', 'Francis', 'movie', 'script', 'narration', 'explanation', 'ranch', 'hints', 'fact', 'something', 'horrible', 'happened', 'owner', 'only', 'clothes', 'identified', 'closed', 'casket', 'movie', 'potential', 'murder', 'one.Another', 'problem', 'script', 'are', 'likable', 'characters', 'NONE', 'found', 'rooting', 'creepy', 'old', 'caretaker', 'Solomon', 'story', 'mean', 'movie', 'only', 'three', 'characters', 'develop', 'kind', 'personality', 'suspense', 'when', 'time', 'big', 'reveal', 'end', 'Everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'could', 'call', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'just', 'there', 'screen', 'time', 'spent', 'develop', 'characters', 'not', 'hearing', 'dialog', 'well', 'feeble', 'attempts', 'when', 'are', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'learn', 'names', 'know', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'did', 'know', 'more', 'anyway.One', 'characters', 'come', 'across', 'guy', 'named', 'John', 'who', 'introduced', 'audience', 'hothead', 'party', 'later', 'what', 'be', 'brutal', 'rape', 'scene', 'supposed', 'good', 'guys', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'relationship', 'John', 'woman', ""n't"", 'established', 'time', 'movie', ""'re"", 'left', 'thinking', 'apparently', 'wanted', 'be', 'ravaged', 'creep', 'up', 'being', 'later', 'None', 'backstory', 'explained', 'so', 'assume', 'what', 'see', 'ugly', 'rape', 'scene', 'faceless', 'characters', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'approving', 'smiles', 'faces.The', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'basically', 'Mark', 'Solomon', 'surrounded', 'unidentified', 'hippies', 'fine', 'dandy', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""'re"", 'nondescript', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Two', 'fo', 'victims', 'have', 'lines', 'movie', 'NONE.To', 'say', 'most', 'cast', 'completely', 'nondescript', 'understatement', 'incredible', 'thing', ""'re"", 'scenes', 'scenes', 'tell', 'nothing', 'terms', 'story', 'say', 'nothing', 'character', 'possible', 'Normally', 'happen', 'here.People', 'end', 'are', 'killed', 'ARMED', 'men', 'out', 'stop', 'violence', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'happen', 'twice', 'murder', 'death', 'mayhem', 'other', 'characters', 'engage', 'leisurely', 'conversation', 'joking', 'other', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'also', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'hanging', 'ranch', 'only', 'time', 'nameless', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'characters', 'care', 'what', 'end', 'big', 'reveal', 'only', 'one', 'developed', 'character', 'left', 'can', 'guess', 'how', 'big', 'reveal', 'Also', 'menace', 'ultimate', 'villain', 'undercut', 'excellent', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'impersonation', 'seeThe', 'Shakiest', 'Gun', 'Westfor', 'reference', 'kill', 'crazy', 'rampage', 'gun', 'guy', 'just', 'have', 'pocket', 'full', 'bullets', 'fit', 'so', 'can', 'reload', ""'m"", 'willing', 'excuse', 'poor', 'fight', 'choreography', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'about', 'as', 'low', 'budget', 'Even', 'willing', 'ignore', 'fact', 'clearly', 'not', 'set', 'ranch', 'clearly', 'was', 'never', 'town', 'became', ""'ghost"", 'town', 'what', 'amusement', 'park.What', 'not', 'excusable', 'script', 'filled', 'loathsomeness', 'stupid', 'plot', 'twists', 'clunkers', 'actors', 'bottom', 'worst', 'things', 'ever', 'released', 'enjoyed', 'song', 'closing', 'credits', 'way', 'top', 'caretaker', 'Solomon', 'not', 'sure', 'not', 'get', 'feeling', 'what', 'happened', ""n't"", 'taken', 'very', 'seriously', 'anyone', 'not', 'sure', 'Solomon', 'tries', 'save', 'second', 'victim', 'not', 'narration', 'tried', 'save', 'identifying', 'who', 'camera', 'Solomon', 'so', 'assume', 'Solomon', 'nearest', 'thing', 'dog', 'film', 'hero', 'repeated', 'line', 'IT', 'WILL', 'BEGIN', 'AGAIN', 'imagine', 'Manson', 'family', 'made', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'exactly']",N/A
