It pulls you in and makes you wonder what's going to happen next. A few minutes into the film, however, it starts to show traits of some pointless independent movie. Luckily, it picks up when Janeane Garofalo, the dry and sarcastic FBI agent, steps in. Joaquin Phoenix, whose brilliance as an actor is becoming more evident with every progressive film, turns in a commendable performance. Vince Vaughn provides great comic relief as your stereotypical, insane cowboy. The rest of the cast is also brilliant, however subtle their roles are. Although not perfect, this film has a way of staying with you, with its quirky and fun soundtrack, offbeat performances, fast-paced and intricately woven plot, and desolate country setting.

Well, maybe not to that extent, but along the same lines.PLOT: Clay Bidwell (Phoenix) is having a rough week. The dead body of one of his former girlfriends in found in a local lake, and a floozy he once hooked-up with is found stabbed repeatedly in her home on the outskirts of town. Everyone is suspecting Clay except for a amicable fella named Lester Long (Vaughn), who has a million dollar smile and the charm to back it up. It seems that everywhere Clay goes, death and Lester Long aren't far behind, smiling with a boyish grin and an ""I know something you don't know"" glare in his eyes.It's hard to categorize Clay Pigeons. There are elements of hilarity and elements of suspense, but mostly, the film creates its own distinct vibe by taking the viewer into a bizarre world where death and humor are intermixed and the result is something rather brilliant. Phoenix and Vaughn both deliver masterfully in roles that suit their strengths. For Vaughn, playing a roguish miscreant who saturates his world with intellectual wit was something quite entertaining to behold. On the flipside, Phoenix is right at home in playing the role of a kid who is clinging desperately to his sanity as the world around him crumbles under the weight of accusation.Overall, Clay Pigeons is a solid film that will keep you engaged to the end.

455713,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305240035,Matthew Horner,"[3, 3]","I can't tell you much about the plot of the surprisingly well made Clay Pigeons without giving too much away. The movie's twists and turns are much of the fun. I can say that at one point, the town sheriff turns to young Clay Birdwell [Joaquin Phoenix] and asks him to quit turning up in places where a murder has been committed.The picture is set in Montana, but most of its breathtaking photography was shot in Utah. The scenery underlines the story, for much of it is both beautiful and foreboding. All those vast open spaces hint at underlying danger, as well as vulnerability.Joaquin Phoenix, whom we first saw ten years ago as a kid in Parenthood, has been very promising in movies like Inventing the Abbotts and Parenthood. Clay Pigeons should mark his transition into a serious actor. His speech patterns, facial expressions and body language make Clay Birdwell a character not soon to be forgotten. In the next decade, his imperfect, chiseled looks should make him a welcome balance to the pretty boy looks of talented actors such as Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio.Clay shows us something not all of us want to see. A life can go on fairly routinely for years, then suddenly spin hopelessly out of control in one afternoon. What are we willing to resort to if that happens?Vince Vaughn also shines in this picture. Here, his innocent school boy manner works much better than it did in the unfortunate remake of Psycho, where we all knew the story to begin with. Also first-rate is Janeane Garfalo, who plays an FBI agent. Garfalo is one of our finest character actresses. She's the type you've seen many times, but can never place her name. She is set to appear in no less than eleven movies this year. Her portrayal is a delight. I suspect she based it on Scully in X-Files. If so, hers is a wonderful parody.Clay Pigeons succeeds in a very tricky genre, which I call black comedy about very bad things. You have to be very good at your craft to pull this category off. Usually, these movies end up being tasteless and offensive. An example of that is the current boxoffice hit Payback, which is among the most mean-spirited movies ever made.Some will have a problem with Clay's choices at the end of the film. I liked it. It was refreshing to see a character not go for the easy way out.",4,Great performances highlight dark comedy,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,2299,"['ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'plot', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'made', 'Clay', 'Pigeons', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'movie', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'much', 'fun', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'point', 'town', 'sheriff', 'young', 'Clay', 'Birdwell', '[', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', ']', 'quit', 'turning', 'up', 'places', 'where', 'murder', 'been', 'committed.The', 'picture', 'set', 'Montana', 'most', 'breathtaking', 'photography', 'was', 'shot', 'Utah', 'scenery', 'story', 'much', 'beautiful', 'foreboding', 'vast', 'open', 'spaces', 'hint', 'underlying', 'danger', 'as', 'well', 'vulnerability.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'whom', 'first', 'saw', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'kid', 'Parenthood', 'been', 'very', 'promising', 'movies', 'Inventing', 'Abbotts', 'Parenthood', 'Clay', 'Pigeons', 'should', 'mark', 'transition', 'serious', 'actor', 'speech', 'patterns', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'make', 'Clay', 'Birdwell', 'character', 'not', 'soon', 'be', 'forgotten', 'next', 'decade', 'imperfect', 'chiseled', 'looks', 'should', 'make', 'welcome', 'balance', 'pretty', 'boy', 'looks', 'talented', 'actors', 'such', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio.Clay', 'something', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'life', 'can', 'go', 'fairly', 'routinely', 'years', 'then', 'suddenly', 'spin', 'hopelessly', 'control', 'one', 'afternoon', 'What', 'are', 'willing', 'resort', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'also', 'picture', 'Here', 'innocent', 'school', 'boy', 'manner', 'much', 'better', 'did', 'unfortunate', 'remake', 'Psycho', 'where', 'knew', 'story', 'begin', 'Also', 'first-rate', 'Janeane', 'Garfalo', 'who', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Garfalo', 'one', 'finest', 'character', 'actresses', 'type', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'never', 'place', 'name', 'set', 'appear', 'less', 'eleven', 'movies', 'year', 'portrayal', 'delight', 'suspect', 'based', 'Scully', 'X-Files', 'so', 'hers', 'wonderful', 'parody.Clay', 'Pigeons', 'very', 'tricky', 'genre', 'call', 'black', 'comedy', 'very', 'bad', 'things', 'have', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'craft', 'pull', 'category', 'off', 'Usually', 'movies', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'tasteless', 'offensive', 'example', 'current', 'boxoffice', 'hit', 'Payback', 'most', 'mean-spirited', 'movies', 'ever', 'made.Some', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'Clay', 'choices', 'end', 'film', 'liked', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'character', 'not', 'go', 'easy', 'way']",Clay Pigeons VHS

455718,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305240035,Reviewer,"[6, 6]","In a small town out west, a target practice outing with a friend kicks off a chain of bizarre events that lead a man to involvement with murder and an  unsolicited alliance with a person of, shall we say, ""questionable""  character in ""Clay Pigeons,"" directed by David Dobkin.  Joaquin Phoenix is  Clay Birdwell, a regular guy whose lack of judgment and discretion catches  up with him unexpectedly in this dark, maddening tale of morality and fate  that is sometimes morose and disturbing, at other times darkly humorous, as  it deftly examines the trappings of the tangled webs we humans weave.  Clay  has become mired in a moral dilemma from which there seems to be no escape,  when he meets and is befriended by Lester Long (Vince Vaughn), a trucker  passing through town one night.  At a local bar, Lester observes that Clay  doesn't exactly have a way with women; it gets Lester's attention, which  leads to a game of pool and, later on, a casual fishing trip that, like the  target practice outing, proves to be a life-altering experience for Clay.  Phoenix is perfectly cast as Clay, ably conveying the effects of the dark  quagmire into which he is cast by circumstances he is unable to control.  His performance enables you to feel him sinking ever deeper as the story  moves along, and to empathize with him and experience what he is going  through.  You realize that he understands his situation, and it becomes a  matter of waiting to see if he will make the right decisions, regardless of  the inevitable consequences.  It creates a tension that makes you want to  yell at the screen to tell him what to do.  Vaughn is excellent as well as  the cowboy trucker with the winning smile, robust laugh and a closet full  of dark secrets.  There's a menace behind the good-natured facade he puts  on that becomes more pronounced as the events unfold.  Pretty early on you  know what this guy is all about, but somehow it only enhances the anxiety  of the whole situation as it becomes a cat-and mouse game (with some  unexpected twists) between Clay and Lester.  Another notable performance  comes from the charismatic Janeane Garofalo, who is surprisingly effective  and credible as F.B.I. agent Dale Shelby, who comes to town when things  take a turn and begin to heat up.  It's a credit to her talent and  versatility that she can pull this character off so well.  The  supporting cast includes Georgina Cates (Amanda), Scott Wilson (Sheriff  Mooney), Vince Vieluf (Deputy Barney), and Monica Moench (Kimberly).  There  are moments in this movie that absolutely make you want to tear your hair  out, a credit to the way Dobkin put this project together and delivered it.  ""Clay Pigeons"" is a nail-biter that will keep you going right up to the  end (which is terrific); Clay and Lester are characters you're going to  remember, and just to make sure there's a brief, inspired reminder at the  end of the credits (so stay with it all the way).  Relatively overlooked  during it's original release, this film should gain new life on video, and  deservedly so; this is one you'll be glad you took a look at.",4,The Tangled Webs We Weave,966470400,"08 17, 2000",2000,3114,"['small', 'town', 'west', 'target', 'practice', 'outing', 'friend', 'off', 'chain', 'bizarre', 'events', 'lead', 'man', 'involvement', 'murder', 'unsolicited', 'alliance', 'person', 'shall', 'say', 'questionable', 'character', 'Clay', 'Pigeons', 'directed', 'David', 'Dobkin', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Clay', 'Birdwell', 'regular', 'guy', 'lack', 'judgment', 'discretion', 'catches', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'dark', 'maddening', 'tale', 'morality', 'fate', 'sometimes', 'morose', 'disturbing', 'other', 'times', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'deftly', 'trappings', 'tangled', 'webs', 'humans', 'weave', 'Clay', 'become', 'mired', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'be', 'escape', 'when', 'befriended', 'Lester', 'Long', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'trucker', 'passing', 'town', 'one', 'night', 'local', 'bar', 'Lester', 'Clay', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'way', 'women', 'Lester', 'attention', 'game', 'pool', 'later', 'casual', 'fishing', 'trip', 'target', 'practice', 'outing', 'be', 'life-altering', 'experience', 'Clay', 'Phoenix', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Clay', 'ably', 'conveying', 'effects', 'dark', 'quagmire', 'cast', 'circumstances', 'unable', 'control', 'performance', 'feel', 'sinking', 'ever', 'deeper', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'empathize', 'experience', 'what', 'going', 'realize', 'situation', 'matter', 'waiting', 'see', 'will', 'make', 'right', 'decisions', 'regardless', 'inevitable', 'consequences', 'tension', 'want', 'yell', 'screen', 'tell', 'what', 'do', 'Vaughn', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'cowboy', 'trucker', 'winning', 'smile', 'robust', 'laugh', 'closet', 'full', 'dark', 'secrets', 'menace', 'good-natured', 'facade', 'more', 'pronounced', 'events', 'unfold', 'Pretty', 'early', 'know', 'what', 'guy', 'somehow', 'only', 'anxiety', 'whole', 'situation', 'cat-and', 'mouse', 'game', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'Clay', 'Lester', 'notable', 'performance', 'charismatic', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'credible', 'F.B.I', 'agent', 'Dale', 'Shelby', 'who', 'town', 'when', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'begin', 'heat', 'up', 'credit', 'talent', 'versatility', 'can', 'pull', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Georgina', 'Cates', 'Amanda', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'Sheriff', 'Mooney', 'Vince', 'Vieluf', 'Deputy', 'Barney', 'Monica', 'Moench', 'Kimberly', 'are', 'moments', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'make', 'want', 'tear', 'hair', 'out', 'credit', 'way', 'Dobkin', 'put', 'project', 'together', 'delivered', 'Clay', 'Pigeons', 'nail-biter', 'will', 'keep', 'going', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'terrific', 'Clay', 'Lester', 'are', 'characters', ""'re"", 'going', 'remember', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'brief', 'inspired', 'reminder', 'end', 'credits', 'so', 'stay', 'way', 'Relatively', 'overlooked', 'original', 'release', 'film', 'should', 'gain', 'new', 'life', 'video', 'deservedly', 'so', 'one', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'took', 'look']",Clay Pigeons VHS
