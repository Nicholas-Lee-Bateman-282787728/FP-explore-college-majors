This is one gripping disturbing true story that everyone should see.It's a masterpiece of movie making. It's the true story of injustice system when a mentallychallenged 19 year old is hung for the killing of a policeman by his 16 year old friend whoonly got 10 years in jail! The movie is based in the 50's and is brilliantly done by directorand actors. I noticed the dad in the movie is played by the actor who was brilliant as theprivate in Night of the Generals and he's as good in this role. The actors playing thetwo boys are also excellent. It makes a good case for the death penalty to be looked atmore carefully but this case was just pure incompetence by those involved in prosecutingthis case and to this day the case has never been over turned to clear the innocents name.,5,You should have this!,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,892,"['found', 'vhs', 'promo', 'copy', 'goodwill', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'kindof', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'one', 'gripping', 'disturbing', 'true', 'story', 'everyone', 'should', 'see.It', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'making', 'true', 'story', 'injustice', 'system', 'when', 'mentallychallenged', '19', 'year', 'old', 'hung', 'killing', 'policeman', '16', 'year', 'old', 'friend', 'whoonly', 'got', '10', 'years', 'jail', 'movie', 'based', '50', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'directorand', 'actors', 'noticed', 'dad', 'movie', 'played', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'brilliant', 'theprivate', 'Night', 'Generals', 'as', 'good', 'role', 'actors', 'playing', 'thetwo', 'boys', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'good', 'case', 'death', 'penalty', 'be', 'looked', 'atmore', 'carefully', 'case', 'was', 'just', 'pure', 'incompetence', 'involved', 'prosecutingthis', 'case', 'day', 'case', 'never', 'been', 'over', 'turned', 'clear', 'innocents', 'name']",Let Him Have It VHS
378609,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,630351524X,Brian,"[2, 4]","After watching 'Let Him Have It' for the first time based upon overwhelmingly positive reviews on this site and elsewhere, I had the less-than-fulfilling feeling that I've seen this film before.  The acting is mainly fine, as are the sets, locations and photography.  Its themes, however, are just too familiar, bordering on cliche, as presented in the touching but generally superficial script, and the story-- while told in a quaintly understated way by director Medak (except perhaps for the scenes involving the almost comically Cagneyesque Craig brothers)-- rings as a partial truth, which is often the problem with reality-based cinema ('A Beautiful Mind,' 'Bloody Sunday,' and 'Birdman of Alcatraz' pop to mind), and particularly with reality-based cinema involving that dreaded, perennial villain Social Injustice ('In the Name of the Father,' 'A Dry White Season,' 'The Hurricane,' etc.).I don't, as some reviewers do, decry a movie for not delving into areas I personally believe it should have (e.g., what were the Crown's reasons for so rigidly pursuing the death penalty in this obviously shaky legal case?)-- it must be judged for what it is rather than for what it is not.  But when that movie's emotional balance hinges on a specific, historic issue or incident I think it always improves the work's veracity, and thereby its watchability, to show as many sides of that issue or incident as cinematically possible.  Otherwise the viewer suspects the film's creators of having an agenda, of pushing him by revision or omission to reach the conclusions they have reached (are we given fair detail about Derek's behavior, his condition, his petty criminal involvements, his relationship to his family, the court proceedings and so on?), and by those intellectual standards I've docked the very emotional LHHI a couple of points.",3,Well-made but one-dimensional,1279843200,"07 23, 2010",2010,1841,"['watching', ""'Let"", 'Him', 'Have', 'first', 'time', 'based', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'site', 'elsewhere', 'had', 'less-than-fulfilling', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'acting', 'mainly', 'fine', 'are', 'sets', 'locations', 'photography', 'themes', 'however', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'familiar', 'bordering', 'cliche', 'presented', 'touching', 'generally', 'superficial', 'script', 'story', 'told', 'quaintly', 'understated', 'way', 'director', 'Medak', 'perhaps', 'scenes', 'involving', 'almost', 'comically', 'Cagneyesque', 'Craig', 'brothers', 'rings', 'partial', 'truth', 'often', 'problem', 'reality-based', 'cinema', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', ""'Bloody"", 'Sunday', ""'Birdman"", 'Alcatraz', 'pop', 'mind', 'particularly', 'reality-based', 'cinema', 'involving', 'dreaded', 'perennial', 'villain', 'Social', 'Injustice', 'Name', 'Father', 'Dry', 'White', 'Season', 'Hurricane', 'etc', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'reviewers', 'do', 'decry', 'movie', 'not', 'delving', 'areas', 'personally', 'believe', 'should', 'have', 'e.g.', 'what', 'were', 'Crown', 'reasons', 'so', 'rigidly', 'pursuing', 'death', 'penalty', 'obviously', 'shaky', 'legal', 'case', 'must', 'be', 'judged', 'what', 'rather', 'what', 'not', 'when', 'movie', 'emotional', 'balance', 'hinges', 'specific', 'historic', 'issue', 'incident', 'think', 'always', 'work', 'veracity', 'thereby', 'watchability', 'show', 'many', 'sides', 'issue', 'incident', 'cinematically', 'possible', 'Otherwise', 'viewer', 'film', 'creators', 'having', 'agenda', 'pushing', 'revision', 'omission', 'reach', 'conclusions', 'have', 'reached', 'are', 'given', 'fair', 'detail', 'Derek', 'behavior', 'condition', 'petty', 'criminal', 'involvements', 'relationship', 'family', 'court', 'proceedings', 'so', 'intellectual', 'standards', ""'ve"", 'docked', 'very', 'emotional', 'LHHI', 'couple', 'points']",Let Him Have It VHS

L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[1, 1]","As powerless a feeling one knows is to watch someone die, the 1991 film LET HIM HAVE IT reminds us in its telling of the 1950s true story of Derek Bentley, a 19-year old British man who as a child was brain damaged when the Germans bombed his home.  As if that does not cost him enough his resulting lack of judgment leads to getting caught in the middle of a crime that leaves a police officer dead - and a death sentence for the young man upon being found guilty of murder.Viewing the trial scenes in LET HIM HAVE IT, you may ask why no one in the British court seems to want to understand the situation of an adult whose mental age was that of an 11-year old.  Can't they see his disadvantage?  Are they hell bent on making someone pay for the life of the dead policeman?  LET HIM HAVE IT does not say, as if to let us know just how desperate the feeling was for family, friends, and others who cared about both Derek Bentley and justice.See LET HIM HAVE IT.

378613,A1L43KWWR05PCS,630351524X,Lawyeraau,"[27, 28]","This film, based upon a true story, illustrates the misapplication of the death penalty. In 1953 England, a slow witted young man, Derek Bentley, was executed, hanged  for his alleged part in the killing of a police officer. It was a case which received much notoriety at the time.Derek Bentley (Chris Eccleston) was a learning disabled, young man who was easily led. His sister, Iris (Clare Holman), however, treated him like a regular guy, and he thrived under her watchful eye. His steadfast, working class parents, William and Lilian Bentley (Tom Courtenay and Eileen Atkins), did everything they could to ensure that their son would stay on the straight and narrow. Still, boys will be boys, and one night, Derek, wanting to be one of the boys, simply hooked up with the wrong crowd who was up to no good. Although Derek was unarmed, another of the other boys was not, and when an inevitable clash with the police came about, a police officer was shot. Derek's by now famous words, ""Let him have it"", were the catalyst for his trial, conviction, and execution.Notwithstanding Derek's learning disability, the ambiguity of the statement attributed to him, and his tangential involvement during the shootout with the police, Derek was given the death penalty. The draconian sentence was a heartbreaking blow to Derek and his family, as it was always Derek's position that he meant for the shooter to let the police have the gun. Nearly forty five years later, after persistent efforts by his beloved sister, Iris, Derek was finally exonerated by the very courts that had earlier found him guilty. In reality, it was too little, too late, for Derek.Chris Eccleston gives a bravura performance as the slow witted Derek, compelling and moving. He plays him as a young man who was aware of his shortcomings and very much wanted to be accepted by his peers. Tom Courtenay and Eileen Atkins are outstanding as the loving parents whose steadfast belief in the system is derailed at the last. Clare Holman is excellent as the sister whose expectations of her brother would never fail to make him try harder. All in all, the entire cast gives notable performances. Superbly directed by Peter Medak, it is a film well worth watching.",5,THEY LET HIM HAVE IT...,1024099200,"06 15, 2002",2002,2226,"['film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'misapplication', 'death', 'penalty', '1953', 'England', 'slow', 'witted', 'young', 'man', 'Derek', 'Bentley', 'was', 'executed', 'hanged', 'alleged', 'part', 'killing', 'police', 'officer', 'was', 'case', 'received', 'much', 'notoriety', 'time.Derek', 'Bentley', 'Chris', 'Eccleston', 'was', 'learning', 'disabled', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'easily', 'led', 'sister', 'Iris', 'Clare', 'Holman', 'however', 'treated', 'regular', 'guy', 'thrived', 'watchful', 'eye', 'steadfast', 'working', 'class', 'parents', 'William', 'Lilian', 'Bentley', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'ensure', 'son', 'would', 'stay', 'straight', 'narrow', 'Still', 'boys', 'will', 'be', 'boys', 'one', 'night', 'Derek', 'wanting', 'be', 'one', 'boys', 'simply', 'hooked', 'up', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'who', 'was', 'up', 'good', 'Derek', 'was', 'unarmed', 'other', 'boys', 'was', 'not', 'when', 'inevitable', 'clash', 'police', 'came', 'about', 'police', 'officer', 'was', 'shot', 'Derek', 'now', 'famous', 'words', 'Let', 'have', 'were', 'catalyst', 'trial', 'conviction', 'execution.Notwithstanding', 'Derek', 'learning', 'disability', 'ambiguity', 'statement', 'attributed', 'tangential', 'involvement', 'shootout', 'police', 'Derek', 'was', 'given', 'death', 'penalty', 'draconian', 'sentence', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'blow', 'Derek', 'family', 'was', 'always', 'Derek', 'position', 'meant', 'shooter', 'let', 'police', 'have', 'gun', 'Nearly', 'forty', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'persistent', 'efforts', 'beloved', 'sister', 'Iris', 'Derek', 'was', 'finally', 'exonerated', 'very', 'courts', 'had', 'earlier', 'found', 'guilty', 'reality', 'was', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'Derek.Chris', 'Eccleston', 'bravura', 'performance', 'slow', 'witted', 'Derek', 'compelling', 'moving', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'aware', 'shortcomings', 'very', 'much', 'wanted', 'be', 'accepted', 'peers', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'are', 'outstanding', 'loving', 'parents', 'steadfast', 'belief', 'system', 'derailed', 'last', 'Clare', 'Holman', 'excellent', 'sister', 'expectations', 'brother', 'would', 'never', 'fail', 'make', 'try', 'harder', 'entire', 'cast', 'notable', 'performances', 'Superbly', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Medak', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Let Him Have It VHS

378619,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,630351524X,Westley,"[4, 4]","""Let Him Have It"" tells the real-life story of 1950s British teen, Derek Bentley (Christopher Eccleston).  As a child during WWII, Derek's home was bombed, and he sustained a head injury which left him with low intelligence and poor decision-making skills.  He ends up falling in with a bad crowd, who take advantage of Derek's desire to fit in and his naivety.  He's sent to an ""approved school"" (reform school) for years, and after his release Derek's family does everything they can to keep him out of trouble.  However, a group of teens, lead by Christopher Craig, soon persuades Derek to join in their robberies.  Derek tries to break free of their influence, but the situation leads to tragedy.The film does a nice job telling Derek's story in a sympathetic way and adroitly combines the crime elements and court trial to tell a cohesive story.  The movie raises interesting questions concerning how we hold people accountable based on issues of age and intelligence.  Although its somewhat low-key story-telling style could have been pumped up a tad, the movie avoids unnecessary melodrama, which adds gravity to the finale.  The acting is uniformly fine, with many of the supporting roles taken up by top-notch actors, including Tom Courtenay, Eileen Atkins, and Tom Bell.  What really makes the film worth-while, though, is its superb look.  As he did with ""The Krays"" a year previously, director Peter Medak beautifully recreates the look and feel of London crime in the 1950s and 1960s.
