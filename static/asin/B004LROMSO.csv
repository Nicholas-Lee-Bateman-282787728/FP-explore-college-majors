Their take on mythical characters was refreshing and definitely more realistic. Perhaps the biggest attraction is Merlin played by Joseph Fiennes. This is no standard Merlin for sure. Completely different ""bad ass"" type of Merlin with shaved head, tattoos and cryptic scars all over his body, Fiennes does what he does so well and creates and anti-hero type Merlin. This character is not alone in redefining the mythos of Camelot... King Arthur played by Jamie Campbell does a marvelous job at seeming meek and confused but as the series progresses he manages to play a convincingly heroic Arthur by the end of season. Morgan played by Eva Green was also done quite well. How do I know this? Because though she is amazingly beautiful, you manage to hate her guts as the season progresses. Gawain is an awesome double sward weilding soldier who trains Arthurs knights, Lancelot known as Leontis is probably the only character along with Gawain not straying from the original legend. Leontis tried, true and faithful to his kings oozes nobility loyalty. I can go on and on about all the characters and initially maybe because of ingrained stereo types of Camelot, you are put off by the characters but if you stick to the series, I guarantee you will grow to appreciate them as the spirit of Camelot with twist of reality.Magic is touched on in this series but it is not overt and quite rare. Most of the magic is performed by Morgan but Merlin intentionally does not flaunt or practice because his power is too great to control and addicting so he represses himself but when he does use magic, it is truly powerful sometimes with dire consequences. Morgan also suffers more for this for her constant use of it. Battles are not epic like game of thrones, as a matter of fact battles are quite small with maybe 40 men in the field, and it can become off putting as it seems unrealistic that a kingdom could only be comprised of such small armies. I have to think it was simply budgetary constraints. For what ever reason, Camelot was just not hit like Spartacus was and starz seemed to give up on it. A real shame because it was a refreshing take on myth and the actors were superb with flashes of brilliant acting at times.I enjoyed the series and loved the characters. If you decide to watch the series, give it some time, don't give up on it and it will reward you with some great acting and transformations at the end of the season.",4,Poor man's Game of Thrones but pretty darn good nonetheless.,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,2907,"['initially', 'making', 'mistake', 'shying', 'away', 'form', 'Spartacus', 'Starz', 'long', 'time', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'poor', 'man', '300', 'course', 'being', 'absolutely', 'wrong', 'chose', 'give', 'Starz', 'take', 'Camelot', 'try.From', 'beginning', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'better', 'regular', 'tv', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'epic', 'game', 'thrones', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'series', 'characters', 'progress', 'very', 'well', 'really', 'drawing', 'series', 'Their', 'take', 'mythical', 'characters', 'was', 'refreshing', 'definitely', 'more', 'realistic', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'attraction', 'Merlin', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'standard', 'Merlin', 'sure', 'Completely', 'different', 'bad', 'ass', 'type', 'Merlin', 'shaved', 'head', 'tattoos', 'cryptic', 'scars', 'body', 'Fiennes', 'what', 'so', 'well', 'creates', 'anti-hero', 'type', 'Merlin', 'character', 'not', 'alone', 'redefining', 'mythos', 'Camelot', 'King', 'Arthur', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Campbell', 'marvelous', 'job', 'seeming', 'meek', 'confused', 'series', 'play', 'convincingly', 'heroic', 'Arthur', 'end', 'season', 'Morgan', 'played', 'Eva', 'Green', 'was', 'also', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'manage', 'hate', 'guts', 'season', 'Gawain', 'awesome', 'double', 'sward', 'weilding', 'soldier', 'who', 'Arthurs', 'knights', 'Lancelot', 'known', 'Leontis', 'probably', 'only', 'character', 'Gawain', 'not', 'straying', 'original', 'legend', 'Leontis', 'tried', 'true', 'faithful', 'kings', 'nobility', 'loyalty', 'can', 'go', 'characters', 'initially', 'maybe', 'ingrained', 'stereo', 'types', 'Camelot', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'characters', 'stick', 'series', 'guarantee', 'will', 'grow', 'appreciate', 'spirit', 'Camelot', 'twist', 'reality.Magic', 'touched', 'series', 'not', 'overt', 'quite', 'rare', 'Most', 'magic', 'performed', 'Morgan', 'Merlin', 'intentionally', 'not', 'flaunt', 'practice', 'power', 'too', 'great', 'control', 'addicting', 'so', 'when', 'use', 'magic', 'truly', 'powerful', 'sometimes', 'dire', 'consequences', 'Morgan', 'also', 'more', 'constant', 'use', 'Battles', 'are', 'not', 'epic', 'like', 'game', 'thrones', 'matter', 'fact', 'battles', 'are', 'quite', 'small', 'maybe', '40', 'men', 'field', 'can', 'become', 'off', 'putting', 'unrealistic', 'kingdom', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'comprised', 'such', 'small', 'armies', 'have', 'think', 'was', 'simply', 'budgetary', 'constraints', 'what', 'ever', 'reason', 'Camelot', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'hit', 'Spartacus', 'was', 'starz', 'seemed', 'give', 'up', 'real', 'shame', 'was', 'refreshing', 'take', 'myth', 'actors', 'were', 'superb', 'flashes', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'times.I', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'loved', 'characters', 'decide', 'watch', 'series', 'give', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'will', 'reward', 'great', 'acting', 'transformations', 'end', 'season']",N/A
1413301,A1CO7AHNW10RZS,B004LROMSO,"A. Moss ""arm""","[0, 0]","I've been a fan of King Arthur since reading The Once and Future King (T.H. White) decades ago in high school, and have read many, many books both famous and obscure on the subject.  As has been noted, there have been many film versions of the Matter of Britain, some definitely better than others.This year for my birthday, I decided to treat myself to this box set.  I admit the first episode did alarm me a tad with the amount of bare skin and sex featured.  I hoped the show wasn't going to rely extensively on these elements to tell its story.  This, however, died down by Ep 2 and IMO this series got better and better as it progressed.  By the last couple of eps, I was hooked entirely and severely disappointed to learn that there would be no second season!I really enjoyed Jamie Campbell Bower as young Arthur, and Morgan as played by Eva Green--well, she was beyond compare.  It was great to see a Morgan who was truly wicked yet whose wickedness was understandable considering her motivation and background.  It may not have been right that I was rooting for her to win by the end!  But to my mind, Arthur as a character (not to mention Guinevere as a character) was weakened by his involvement in the Arthur/Guinevere/Leontes triangle, which did neither Arthur nor Guinevere any favors and gave each of them a premature history of deception and infidelity long before the expected (and traditional) Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot triangle.  Why dilute that dynamic with a ""trial run""?  I am aware that ""triangles"" are frequent items in modern tv drama and often done to death.  But I found myself getting very impatient with this one, and now when I rewatch, I fast-forward through almost all the Arthur & Guinevere scenes.  The nature of their relationship in this version dragged both of them down.I also liked the way this series hinted at Morgan's nunnery ""education,"" mentioned by Sir Thomas Malory in the first pages of the Morte d'Arthur.  Sinead Cusack's Sybil was an intriguing original character, and to those who have commented that Vivien was undeveloped, well, I'm sure the show was intending to do more with her as things progressed.  It seems to be the trend more often than not lately to make Morgan the daughter rather than the step-daughter of Uther Pendragon, and, considering the way Uther is portrayed in this version, you can't blame her much for bumping him off.  Igraine--well, the way she was portrayed, I came away feeling that Morgan's reaction to her (although perhaps not the murder!) was more justified than not.  Igraine may have been Arthur's mother, but she seemed pretty ineffectual throughout, and her eleventh-hour claim that she'd saved Morgan's life when Uther wanted to kill her just rang sort of flat.This was also the first role I've ever genuinely enjoyed Joseph Fiennes in, even if, as my daughter said, ""This Merlin isn't very 'magical,' is he?"" :)At the end of the day, for me, it's All About Morgan.  Kudos to Eva Green on a great & complex acting feat of being fascinatingly evil and yet sympathetic, but not too much so due to the choices she made.  I'm not sure if those in charge intended her to be as sympathetic as I perceived her to be, or for the ""Camelot"" people besides Arthur to be so dull, but IMO the ""Camelot"" residents were pallid in comparison, though Leontes was an effective (largely original) character despite being pivotal in the ""triangle.""",4,Darn!!

At his adamant refusal, she brings about his death and casts his wife, Queen Igraine (Claire Forlani), from the castle. With the kingdom at peril and concerns high over whether or not a woman can lead, she knows her first responsibility must be to form an alliance with her father's mortal enemy, Lord Lot (James Purefoy). Intrigued at her proposition that they rule side by side, he agrees to help her defend Camelot against potential usurpers, not realizing there is another claimant to the throne.Arthur (Jamie Campbell Bower) has no knowledge of his royal ancestry and lives a simple life in the country, constantly teasing his elder brother by stealing all the best women right out from under his nose and pleasantly troubled by dreams of a beautiful woman (Tamsin Egerton). Then a mysterious and slightly sinister man appears on the doorstep of the family hovel and informs him that he is the illegitimate heir of King Uthur. Since the day he helped bring Arthur into the world, Merlin (Joseph Fienness) has not touched magic again. But he will need to learn to master it if it he is to defeat Morgan, assist Arthur in climbing a mountain to draw the sword from the stone, and make certain Camelot rises again...This cable station has a history of putting controversial content ahead of scripting and while Camelot does suffer from being pointlessly gratuitous, the script is surprisingly solid and the characters are interesting, Merlin most of all as we attempt to discern his motivations and understand his reservations about magic. Fiennes has an excellent grasp on him that makes him likable but also a little sinister and his scenes are among the finest, but it is Eva Green who wins the day with her empathetic but dark Morgan. I know she's supposed to be the villain but I liked her, far more than I probably should. The real problem here is Arthur. I had  hard time liking him and when you're actually rooting for his sister to take the kingdom that shows something is wrong. The writing struggles from being a tad formulaic at times but there are some excellent twists and turns, as well as unusual takes on various legends. (How Merlin comes by Excalibur is chilling and haunting both, as well as their approach to the Lady of the Lake.) The costuming is adequate and imaginative and the setting and backdrop breathtaking (it was filmed in Ireland).In some regards this series is quite good and in others it fails miserably, mostly because a lot of people dislike the actor who plays Arthur. I never minded him so much as I disliked the figure of Arthur -- he is something of a hypocrite and completely selfish, but does gradually begin to mature as the series unfolds. The manner in which the audience comes to know Morgan is a good one (we never know from one episode to the next whether to hate her or have pity for her) and Merlin is perhaps one of the greatest, most ambiguous depictions of the character in recent film. Alas, Starz' emphasis on turning the story into a soft-core porn romp leaves much to be desired.",2,Not What It Could Have Been,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3503,"['have', 'never', 'really', 'found', 'version', 'King', 'Arthur', 'legend', 'preferred', 'other', 'had', 'semi', 'high', 'hopes', 'series', 'never', 'quite', 'worked', 'me.Banished', 'wake', 'father', 'marriage', 'new', 'queen', 'Morgan', 'Fay', 'Eva', 'Green', 'determined', 'reclaim', 'throne', 'Hoping', 'father', 'will', 'take', 'back', 'estrangement', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'redeem', 'previous', 'bad', 'behavior', 'return', 'line', 'succession', 'adamant', 'refusal', 'death', 'wife', 'Queen', 'Igraine', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'castle', 'kingdom', 'peril', 'concerns', 'high', 'not', 'woman', 'can', 'lead', 'first', 'responsibility', 'must', 'be', 'form', 'alliance', 'father', 'mortal', 'enemy', 'Lord', 'Lot', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'Intrigued', 'proposition', 'rule', 'side', 'side', 'help', 'defend', 'Camelot', 'potential', 'usurpers', 'not', 'realizing', 'claimant', 'throne.Arthur', 'Jamie', 'Campbell', 'Bower', 'knowledge', 'royal', 'ancestry', 'simple', 'life', 'country', 'constantly', 'teasing', 'elder', 'brother', 'stealing', 'best', 'women', 'right', 'nose', 'pleasantly', 'troubled', 'dreams', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Tamsin', 'Egerton', 'Then', 'mysterious', 'slightly', 'sinister', 'man', 'doorstep', 'family', 'hovel', 'illegitimate', 'heir', 'King', 'Uthur', 'day', 'helped', 'bring', 'Arthur', 'world', 'Merlin', 'Joseph', 'Fienness', 'not', 'touched', 'magic', 'again', 'will', 'need', 'learn', 'master', 'defeat', 'Morgan', 'assist', 'Arthur', 'climbing', 'mountain', 'draw', 'sword', 'stone', 'make', 'certain', 'Camelot', 'rises', 'again', 'cable', 'station', 'history', 'putting', 'controversial', 'content', 'ahead', 'scripting', 'Camelot', 'suffer', 'being', 'pointlessly', 'gratuitous', 'script', 'surprisingly', 'solid', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'Merlin', 'most', 'attempt', 'discern', 'motivations', 'understand', 'reservations', 'magic', 'Fiennes', 'excellent', 'grasp', 'likable', 'also', 'little', 'sinister', 'scenes', 'are', 'finest', 'Eva', 'Green', 'who', 'day', 'empathetic', 'dark', 'Morgan', 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'villain', 'liked', 'far', 'more', 'probably', 'should', 'real', 'problem', 'here', 'Arthur', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'liking', 'when', ""'re"", 'actually', 'rooting', 'sister', 'take', 'kingdom', 'something', 'wrong', 'writing', 'struggles', 'being', 'tad', 'formulaic', 'times', 'are', 'excellent', 'twists', 'turns', 'as', 'well', 'unusual', 'various', 'legends', 'How', 'Merlin', 'Excalibur', 'chilling', 'haunting', 'as', 'well', 'approach', 'Lady', 'Lake', 'costuming', 'adequate', 'imaginative', 'setting', 'backdrop', 'breathtaking', 'was', 'filmed', 'Ireland', '.In', 'regards', 'series', 'quite', 'good', 'others', 'miserably', 'mostly', 'lot', 'people', 'dislike', 'actor', 'who', 'Arthur', 'never', 'minded', 'so', 'much', 'disliked', 'figure', 'Arthur', 'something', 'hypocrite', 'completely', 'selfish', 'gradually', 'begin', 'mature', 'series', 'manner', 'audience', 'know', 'Morgan', 'good', 'one', 'never', 'know', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'hate', 'have', 'pity', 'Merlin', 'perhaps', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'ambiguous', 'depictions', 'character', 'recent', 'film', 'Alas', 'Starz', 'emphasis', 'turning', 'story', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'romp', 'much', 'be', 'desired']",N/A
1413316,AHHUNTFQGUGX8,B004LROMSO,Cody Carlson,"[0, 1]","Starz's series ""Camelot"" is a noble effort to re-imagine the Arthurian legend, but ultimately falls flat because of some serious miscasting, muddled plot lines, and a general uncertainty in just what this series is attempting to accomplish.""Camelot"" does get a lot right.  It's beautifully shot and generally succeeds in presenting the atmosphere of the mythic era.  Eva Green's Morgan Le Fay offers just the right mixture of intelligence and wounded pride, and makes a convincing and genuinely fun villain.  Joesph Fiennes owns every scene he's in.  His Merlin is entirely sympathetic and evokes shades of Alec Guinness as Obi Wan Kenobi as he attempts to lead the young Arthur along the path of his destiny.The glaring and unforgivable sin of ""Camelot"" is in its lead actor, Jamie Campbell Bower as King Arthur.  Bower comes across as whinny, pouting, and thoroughly unconvincing, looking like he'd be more at home in the pulp film ""Twilight"" than in a period costume drama with a legendary pedigree.  His reaction to virtually everything Merlin tells him is a blank, deer-in-the-headlights look.  When he attempts to appear regal, it comes off as strutting and unintentionally comical.  Tamsin Egerton's  Guinevere, though beautiful, is also unconvincing and appears to be just as out of her depth as Bower.  Claire Forlani as Queen Igraine really adds nothing to the show, though one suspects she's capable of more.It is not hard to understand why Starz canceled this show after only one season.  The many things that work in this show cannot make up for its significant drawbacks.

It has the usual people and usual incidents that one would expect of the King Arthur tales, but don't expect them to follow the plots of the story you know and love.  However, the stories they did tell are an interesting twist on the old legends.This is not the best fantasy staging I have ever seen; there is a lack of realism.  Camelot must be small because it takes very little time to travel between farms and castles.  When the men are out hunting deer they are talking and stumbling all over the forest.  There are very few characters in any setting, castle, village, and soldiers.  Most disturbing in my opinion is the choice of actors for King Arthur, Jamie Campbell Bower.  There is some nudity and violence but it doesn't distract from the story.That said, I liked and would recommend the series to anyone who enjoys fantasy, King Arthur, or the Middle Ages.

If you are a history buff, there are a couple other reviews posted where you can get a better look.Arthur and Morgan (Morgana) are brother and sister but Arthur isn't aware. He is kind of a player and lives quite care free. In the mean time, Morgan returns ""home"" to castle Pendragon after being sent away to live with the nuns. No surprise, Uther meets his end. Morgan is ready to be the top dog in the Pedragon clan until Merlin shows up with Arthur. Now the two become rivalries.We see the characters that we've come to know from other tales, with some differences, almost like alternative universes. Arthur is really like a lost boy forced to come into his own. Morgan is just off her rocker. Merlin has an interesting history and the story of the Lady of the Lake is a bit of a twist.

Add this one to the list of worthy adaptations of a myth that dates back to the Dark Ages.  This version is not as grandiose and mystical asExcalibur, nor does it invoke knights in shining armor as John Boorman's classic does.  While Boorman focused onLe Morte d'Arthur (Vol. 2) (French Edition), the present adaptation takes place much earlier ~ seemingly not long after the end of the Roman occupation.  In this way, it fits in withKing Arthur - The Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)andThe Last Legion.  Historically speaking, some people may be surprised to know that the myth of Arthur first came about right around the end of the Roman occupation;  the jousts, glistening armor & all the stuff the readers of Thomas Mallory are familiar with came way, WAY later.Now to the present rendition of the Arthurian legend:  we get an Arthur who is a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky womanizing youth who has the throne thrust upon him by the mysterious sorcerer Merlin.  He spends his time convincing people that he has the goods to be their leader and he finds himself in a huge power struggle with his half sister, Morgana, to build his nascent kingdom.As is the case withThe Tudors: The Complete Series, Michael Hirst is able to find lovely, capable & talented actresses who have no issues with shedding their clothes on-camera.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[70, 98]","I love King Arthur and his legendary knights, whether it's gritty ""historical"" stories or a pile of medieval anachronisms a la Malory.But the once and future king has really gotten more than his fair share of rotten movies and TV, and the latest disaster is ""Camelot."" No, not the Broadway musical or the movie adaptation -- this is Starz's attempt at updating the timeless Arthurian legends (which don't NEED updating), which just turns into a silly, sloppy and overly PC mess.The evil princess Morgan (Eva Green) murders her father Uther, exiles her stepmother, and allies herself with her dad's enemy King Lot. But Merlin (Joseph Fiennes) is having none of this, and hunts down Uther's secret illegitimate son Arthur (Jamie Campbell Bower), who has been raised by an adoptive family in the country. With Merlin's guidance and training (in rock-climbing), Arthur claims the throne --and gains Morgan's wrath.He also falls in love with Guinevere (Tamsin Egerton), the beautiful young wife of a loyal knight, and is deftly manipulated by Merlin in decidedly unmagical ways, sometimes with bloody outcomes. As young Arthur struggles to unite Britain under him, he must deal with Morgan constantly trying to undermine his rule and his power -- but with little idea of just how far she will go.The idea behind ""Camelot"" is not a bad one, and even the rewriting of Arthurian lore (the origins of Excalibur) aren't that bad. The problem is in the execution. This series wants to be a plot-heavy, gritty, authentic ""Game of Thrones""-esque story, but it's actually more of a silly, anachronistic BCC ""Robin Hood"" (complete with multiculturalism and modern feminism, which makes it doubly ridiculous).Yeah, this is one of those series where the costumes, sets, perfectly-coiffed hair and even some of the beautiful scenery all feel like they were lifted from a Renaissance Faire. There's no feeling of timeless grandeur, epicness or awe -- instead, it sometimes feels like ""King Arthur: The Legendary Journeys."" Additionally, the main storyline is.... rather weak, especially since the straightforward Morgan's plans for overthrowing Arthur get downright silly.As for the acting, it's a mixed bag. Fiennes is wonderfully conniving and Machievellian as Merlin, almost to the point of being villainous, Peter Mooney is dynamic as Kay, and Green is brilliantly wrenching as a destructive yet wronged young woman.However, Bower's Arthur is a massive twerp, with zero presence or charisma. He's a skinny surfer-dudeish kid whose appeal is honestly a total mystery. I mean, his Arthur only decides to become king because HE CAN SCORE WITH GIRLS. Who can take that seriously? As for Egerton, she's painfully awkward and rather flat, and her character is Mary-Sueish to the extreme.""Camelot"" is a painful experience -- not just because it's a lackluster, weakly-plotted series, but because it could have easily been so much more.

As is usually the case with miniseries the writers vary from episode to episode (Michael Hirst, Thomas Malory, Louise Fox, Steve Lightfoot and Chris Chibnall) as well as the directors (Mikael Salomon, Ciaran Donnelly, Jeremy Podeswa, and Stefan Schwartz), but the cast remains the same and the overall feeling of the series is one that is seductively dark and has a real sense of a mixture of history and legend.So far we have met King Uther as he dies passing on the crown to the King's unknown son Arthur (Jamie Campbell Bower), heretofore known as a commoner.  Arthur's half sister Morgan (a sinister and beautiful Eva Green) is put in place as Arthur's nemesis, Arthur's journey to kingship is nurtured by Merlin (Joseph Fiennes), and weaving in and out of the opening episode are Queen Igraine (Claire Forlani) and the glowing Guinevere (Tamsin Egerton). Thus far the story is focused on a tough battle ahead for the charming young Arthur against the evil vixen Morgan.

The last sentence is my updated review, as I have now seen the entire series.2nd Note: I saw all the episodes with XFinity On Demand.SPOILERS!!!This series is intriguing for several reasons. I. It's the story of King Arthur as you've never seen it before, II. It stars Joseph Fiennes (""Shakespeare In Love"") as Merlin, Eva Green (""The Dreamers"") as Morgan, Jamie Campbell-Bower as Arthur and Claire Forlani (""The Rock"") as Igraine and III. It has violence, sex and sorcery (but not the kind we're used to reading about in Le Morte D'Arthur and seeing in John Boorman's interesting, but very freely adapted film version of the classic story by Sir Thomas Malory, ""Excalibur."")Like ""Excalibur,"" this series departs radically from the well-known version of the legend, as told in Le Morte D'Arthur written by Sir Thomas Malory and published by William Caxton in 1485. An example: Arthur is a good-looking womanizer. I've no problem with Arthur being handsome, it's just his depiction as a womanizer. It doesn't go with the story, as Sir Ector was a knight and therefore skilled in courtly behaviour and against using women for sex, which is something only a base person and no true knight, much less a true king, would have done. Though Sir Ector tells Arthur not to use his anatomy and always to use his mind & heart when making decisions, it falls flat based on the opening scene. Arthur is nothing like his father Uther in the legend as told by Sir Thomas Malory, whereas here he is exactly like his father, seducing Guinevere even though she is betrothed to another (and it is NOT an illicit affair with Sir Lancelot this time around, either). That's my main issue: Arthur depicted as a womanizer. Also, the dark sorcery which borders strongly on satanic worship is a problem for me. In the legend, the magic does not even approach satanic worship, nor are pentagrams ever mentioned. The acting is great.Final analysis: Interesting series, but Arthur as a womanizer and the dark sorcery are huge minuses.It's a shame that the series has been cancelled, as it ends on a cliff-hanger.

Sure, there are things I like better about Camelot.  ""Merlin"" completely left out Sir Kay, Arthur's brother.  Camelot doesn't make that mistake - and that character is one of the ones you really end up liking.  I have to agree with some of the other reviews here that the show simply didn't go to where it could have.  It doesn't have the gritty realism I was hoping for.  It does, however, have some interesting characters - Merlin, Morgan, Kay, Gawaine and others.  Unfortunately, Arthur is not one of them.  I think the guy they cast for that part was chosen for something he had to do with ""Twilight""????  Sorry, but I never watched any of the Twilight movies, so I'm not sure what he did in them.  Anyway, a show like this really has a problem when it mis-casts its leading man - and they did that.  It's too bad they can't go back a re-do that casting decision before season two starts.  However, because of the good characters they do have, the show still has potential to be something better in the next season.  I hope they get their act together and achieve the potential that's there.  I gave the first season three stars because the first season of a lot of shows is kind of rocky.  Look at Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Who would have known how great that would become just after watching the first season?  I hope Camelot can similarly grow into its own skin.",3,"Not what it could have been, but not a disaster, either.",1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,1931,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'initial', 'thought', 'was', 'was', 'Starz', 'same', 'network', 'doing', 'Spartacus', 'series', 'had', 'very', 'high', 'hopes', 'See', 'past', 'three', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'BBC', 'show', 'Merlin', 'fine', 'little', 'show', 'Arthurian', 'legend', ""'ve"", 'totally', 'buggered', 'original', 'story', 'something', 'very', 'different', 'telling', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'show', 'obviously', 'FOR', 'KIDS', 'Merlin', 'nice', 'show', 'FOR', 'KIDS', 'had', 'hoped', 'one', 'Starz', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'true', 'time', 'version', 'Sure', 'are', 'things', 'like', 'better', 'Camelot', 'Merlin', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'Sir', 'Kay', 'Arthur', 'brother', 'Camelot', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'character', 'one', 'ones', 'really', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'show', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'where', 'could', 'have', ""n't"", 'have', 'gritty', 'realism', 'was', 'hoping', 'however', 'have', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Merlin', 'Morgan', 'Kay', 'Gawaine', 'others', 'Unfortunately', 'Arthur', 'not', 'one', 'think', 'guy', 'cast', 'part', 'was', 'chosen', 'something', 'had', 'do', 'Twilight', 'Sorry', 'never', 'watched', 'Twilight', 'movies', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'did', 'Anyway', 'show', 'really', 'problem', 'when', 'leading', 'man', 'did', 'too', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 're-do', 'casting', 'decision', 'season', 'two', 'starts', 'However', 'good', 'characters', 'do', 'have', 'show', 'still', 'potential', 'be', 'something', 'better', 'next', 'season', 'hope', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'achieve', 'potential', 'there', 'gave', 'first', 'season', 'three', 'stars', 'first', 'season', 'lot', 'shows', 'kind', 'rocky', 'Look', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'how', 'great', 'would', 'become', 'just', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'hope', 'Camelot', 'can', 'similarly', 'grow', 'own', 'skin']",N/A
1413338,A2RJ52PRDB3WQ9,B004LROMSO,Hatman,"[3, 4]","King Arthur seems to be rather a difficult subject to adapt. For me, not one of them has really done it well, but a few come close. Excalibur is a stand out, Mist of Avalon isn't too bad, and even Sam Neill's Merlin tries hard. The recent King Arthur starring Clive Owen was fun, but really a retread of The Seven Samurai.One of the major problems, is what do you put in and what do you leave out? Do you set it in a medieval fantasy world or in the grim Roman-Britain dark ages? How much magic do you put in? Is it real or pagan religion?This adaptation is rather poorly thought out. The stand out problem for me right off the bat are the costumes. The ladies do all right in nebulous renaissance fair outfits, but the men fare poorly. There is hardly any armour and virtually no helmets. This makes the whole thing look cheap and rather silly. Even dark ages Britain went in for armour, if not as much as the later ages. The story of King Arthur, for me, is about KNIGHTS IN ARMOUR, and that's what I expect. Instead you have rather floppy hairstyled young men running around in baggy shirts claiming to be the champions of the king. I don't believe them, they look rather wet. There is no sense that this is King Arthur, these are his KNIGHTS and he is a military force to be reckoned with in the land.The magic aspect is poor. Morgan can do an impressive spell and make herself look like some one else. Impressive. Merlin can burn people and turn lakes to ice in minutes. Very impressive. So magic, powerful magic, exists in this world. So why go for nonmagical explanations about the Sword in the Stone or Excalibur? The treatment of the Sword in the Stone would work in an adaptation with no 'real' magic, but not here. The Excalibur adaptation is worse. Merlin gets the sword for Arthur in a very mundane way (from a weaponsmith), kills the smith, chases the smith's daughter (named Excalibur?!) to her death out on the lake and prises the sword from her dead hand as she sinks beneath the ice that Merlin magically turned the lake into. How bloody complicated! How dumb! The story's already there, why not just do that instead?The cast are OK and there are a quite a few shots of attractive naked ladies on view for those of us who like that sort of thing. Joseph Fiennes and Claire Forlani seem to be trying to act being each other in their scenes together. Fortunately Forlani has long hair, so you can tell them apart. Actually, that's kind of mean for me to say that, but their scenes are rather tedious. The whole Arthur, Guinevere, Guinevere's so-what husband character plot line is lame too. It just wastes storytelling time.The best thing in this is Eva Green. She does a great job. Pity the show around her is lame.So, all in all, a wasted opportunity. So much gold in Malory, so much drek here. I did watch this right after watching Game of Thrones, but even without that excellent series fresh in my mind, this is LAME.",3,Missing the point.,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,2938,"['King', 'Arthur', 'be', 'rather', 'difficult', 'subject', 'adapt', 'not', 'one', 'really', 'done', 'well', 'few', 'come', 'close', 'Excalibur', 'stand', 'out', 'Mist', 'Avalon', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'even', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Merlin', 'hard', 'recent', 'King', 'Arthur', 'starring', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'was', 'fun', 'really', 'retread', 'Seven', 'Samurai.One', 'major', 'problems', 'what', 'do', 'put', 'what', 'do', 'leave', 'out', 'Do', 'set', 'medieval', 'fantasy', 'world', 'grim', 'Roman-Britain', 'dark', 'ages', 'How', 'much', 'magic', 'do', 'put', 'real', 'pagan', 'religion', 'adaptation', 'rather', 'poorly', 'thought', 'out', 'stand', 'out', 'problem', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'are', 'costumes', 'ladies', 'do', 'right', 'nebulous', 'renaissance', 'fair', 'outfits', 'men', 'fare', 'poorly', 'hardly', 'armour', 'virtually', 'helmets', 'whole', 'thing', 'look', 'cheap', 'rather', 'silly', 'Even', 'dark', 'ages', 'Britain', 'went', 'armour', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'later', 'ages', 'story', 'King', 'Arthur', 'KNIGHTS', 'IN', 'ARMOUR', 'what', 'expect', 'Instead', 'have', 'rather', 'floppy', 'hairstyled', 'young', 'men', 'running', 'around', 'baggy', 'shirts', 'claiming', 'be', 'champions', 'king', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'look', 'rather', 'wet', 'sense', 'King', 'Arthur', 'are', 'KNIGHTS', 'military', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'land.The', 'magic', 'aspect', 'poor', 'Morgan', 'can', 'do', 'impressive', 'spell', 'make', 'look', 'one', 'else', 'Impressive', 'Merlin', 'can', 'burn', 'people', 'turn', 'lakes', 'ice', 'minutes', 'Very', 'impressive', 'So', 'magic', 'powerful', 'magic', 'world', 'why', 'go', 'nonmagical', 'explanations', 'Sword', 'Stone', 'Excalibur', 'treatment', 'Sword', 'Stone', 'would', 'work', 'adaptation', ""'real"", 'magic', 'not', 'here', 'Excalibur', 'adaptation', 'worse', 'Merlin', 'sword', 'Arthur', 'very', 'mundane', 'way', 'weaponsmith', 'smith', 'smith', 'daughter', 'named', 'Excalibur', 'death', 'lake', 'sword', 'dead', 'hand', 'ice', 'Merlin', 'magically', 'turned', 'lake', 'How', 'bloody', 'complicated', 'How', 'dumb', 'story', 'already', 'there', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'do', 'instead', 'cast', 'are', 'OK', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'shots', 'attractive', 'naked', 'ladies', 'view', 'who', 'sort', 'thing', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'act', 'being', 'other', 'scenes', 'together', 'Fortunately', 'Forlani', 'long', 'hair', 'can', 'tell', 'apart', 'Actually', 'kind', 'mean', 'say', 'scenes', 'are', 'rather', 'tedious', 'whole', 'Arthur', 'Guinevere', 'Guinevere', 'so-what', 'husband', 'character', 'plot', 'line', 'lame', 'too', 'just', 'storytelling', 'time.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Eva', 'Green', 'great', 'job', 'Pity', 'show', 'lame.So', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'So', 'much', 'gold', 'Malory', 'so', 'much', 'drek', 'here', 'did', 'watch', 'right', 'watching', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'even', 'excellent', 'series', 'fresh', 'mind', 'LAME']",N/A

It is also hard to avoid comparing Merlin with Camelot, but the two series could not be more different.  Where Merlin is a Smallville version of the King Arthur tale, Camelot is a darker, non-humorous take on the ascent of the young king.  In Camelot, Arthur is a bit of a lay about, not really going anywhere in life, until he finds out he is actually the son of the dying king.  He isn't ready (who would be?) but he must rise to the occasion.  He is ably assisted by the wizard Merlin, played so well by Joseph Fiennes.  Arthur himself is played for the obvious teen heartthrob vibe, but he starts to grow on you as he himself grows.  The skeleton of the story is familiar, as it must be, but there are sufficient twists to keep you interested.Now, the only downside to this version is its network.  Since this is running on Starz, rather than network or basic cable, there is an imperative to throw in irrelevant nudity and gore.

1413354,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B004LROMSO,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[2, 7]","King Arthur is young and pretty, but Camelot is a ruin, and Merlin isn't in such hot shape himself.  Honor and chivalry guide heroes' actions, but casual betrayals threaten Britain's very foundations.  Ceremonial pomp glorifies the great hall, but the kingdom is built of raw wood and drystone walls.  This vision of the Matter of Britain probably runs grittier than any ever filmed, while keeping closest to the classic literature.Like most cable TV dramas, this series uses the lack of censorship to deal frankly with life's many and varied aspects.  It doesn't flinch from sex, and bolsters high feelings with occasional coarse language.  But unlike, say, True Blood, which runs toward exhibitionism, this series crafts a careful balance between its edgy elements and a tautly paced drama.  Even when clothes fly off and groping turns feverish, I never felt dragged through the mud.And this also provides an interesting vision of fantasy as realpolitik.  Wily Merlin and his attempts to manipulate others to enact his visions made an interesting take on a character who has grown bland through overexposure.  Arthur's need to make alliances, and his tendency to break them by acting without thinking, reveal just how delicate much of the putatively chivalrous world depicted in fantasy fiction really is.This makes for a bracing take on a story audiences have seen before, taking it in adventurous new directions without letting us feel we've had the rug ripped out from under us.  Placing it side by side with the BBC'sMerlin, or any of numerous other Arthur renditions through the years, this one stands up well.  This makes a good complement to the myth, and an intriguing addition to a canon that keeps on giving.",5,Bracing Take on an Old Story,1319932800,"10 30, 2011",2011,1720,"['King', 'Arthur', 'young', 'pretty', 'Camelot', 'ruin', 'Merlin', ""n't"", 'such', 'hot', 'shape', 'Honor', 'chivalry', 'guide', 'heroes', 'actions', 'casual', 'betrayals', 'threaten', 'Britain', 'very', 'foundations', 'Ceremonial', 'pomp', 'great', 'hall', 'kingdom', 'built', 'raw', 'wood', 'drystone', 'walls', 'vision', 'Matter', 'Britain', 'probably', 'grittier', 'ever', 'filmed', 'keeping', 'closest', 'classic', 'literature.Like', 'most', 'cable', 'TV', 'dramas', 'series', 'lack', 'censorship', 'deal', 'frankly', 'life', 'many', 'varied', 'aspects', ""n't"", 'flinch', 'sex', 'bolsters', 'high', 'feelings', 'occasional', 'coarse', 'language', 'say', 'True', 'Blood', 'exhibitionism', 'series', 'careful', 'balance', 'edgy', 'elements', 'tautly', 'paced', 'drama', 'Even', 'when', 'clothes', 'fly', 'off', 'groping', 'turns', 'feverish', 'never', 'felt', 'dragged', 'mud.And', 'also', 'interesting', 'vision', 'fantasy', 'realpolitik', 'Wily', 'Merlin', 'attempts', 'manipulate', 'others', 'enact', 'visions', 'made', 'interesting', 'take', 'character', 'who', 'grown', 'bland', 'overexposure', 'Arthur', 'need', 'make', 'alliances', 'tendency', 'break', 'acting', 'thinking', 'reveal', 'just', 'how', 'delicate', 'much', 'putatively', 'chivalrous', 'world', 'depicted', 'fantasy', 'fiction', 'really', 'is.This', 'bracing', 'take', 'story', 'audiences', 'have', 'seen', 'taking', 'adventurous', 'new', 'directions', 'letting', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'had', 'rug', 'ripped', 'Placing', 'side', 'side', ""BBC'sMerlin"", 'numerous', 'other', 'Arthur', 'renditions', 'years', 'one', 'up', 'well', 'good', 'complement', 'myth', 'intriguing', 'addition', 'canon', 'giving']",N/A
1413355,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004LROMSO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[234, 268]","There are some classic tales that have been so oft told, I could probably go my whole life without revisiting the topic.  The legend of King Arthur is certainly one of those stories which has been covered from every angle possible.  And I've seen them all--from classical interpretations (Boorman's Excalibur), musical productions (Lerner and Loewe's Camelot), modern day variations (Romero's Knightriders), introspective art house pieces (Bresson's Lancelot du Lac), and countless other incarnations.  Yet the story is so vivid and enthralling, it's hard to resist its allure.  When I heard that the Starz network was planning to reinvent the legend of ""Camelot,"" I was somewhat apathetic, somewhat worried, but also strangely hopeful.  The network is coming off a huge success with its over-the-top bloody sword and sandals epic ""Spartacus.""  So it makes sense they wanted to tackle another period adventure.  Love it or hate it, though, ""Spartacus"" is a graphic spectacle that will assault your senses and leave you reeling.  ""Camelot"" doesn't attempt the same type of visceral in-your-face aggression, but it seems to want to have it both ways.  This version is completely sanitized for modern viewers (I'll speak to that later) but still wants to be edgy and provocative (oh look, there's Guinevere topless).I'm not going to recount the plot of the boy King, other than to say that this version sticks to the primary elements of the tale while trying some creative sleight of hand to reimagine peripheral aspects.  When King Uther dies under mysterious circumstances, his sorceress daughter Morgan (Eva Green) seems the likely heir.  But cunning Merlin (Joseph Fiennes), who is having visions of foreboding, has a big secret to reveal.  Uther had a illegitimate son Arthur (Jamie Campbell Bower) who has been raised on an idyllic country farm.  Merlin brings the boy to court and starts to build a new kingdom around Arthur--a rule that hopes to combine the disparate and warring factions of the land.  The boy seems an unlikely leader (always does, in my opinion) but is soon learning the laws of the land while establishing new ones.  His rule is challenged in many ways, most subversively by his own sister Morgan, but through all the power plays and political intrigues--don't worry there is still time for that expected dalliance with the lovely Guinevere (who happens to be married to one of his most trusted soldiers).A lot of elements work just fine in this version.  Green's Morgan begins and ends every scene with a glower, and truthfully, it's hard not to root for her success over the hapless wet noodle (I mean, King).  Her plots and machinations, in cahoots with some intriguingly complex female advisers, provide much fun and menace to the series.  Fiennes seems to be having fun with his role--a cross between genius and madman--and is certainly one of the more unpredictable Merlins you're likely to encounter.  This can be both good and bad--I certainly could have lived without his isolated bout of depression.  Arthur's men are strong and interesting.  The sets, costumes, and production values are all noteworthy as well.  Fight scenes are well choreographed and the momentum is kept at a nice clip.For my money, the show still gets dragged down in several significant ways.  First, I never bought, believed in, or rooted for this boy King Arthur.  Campbell Bower is introduced as a charming and irresistible womanizer (in fact, in the hilarious opener--he has seduced his brother's girlfriend into a tumble.  Classy, huh?).  He's so slight, with the look of an angry and petulant child, he hardly cuts the inspiring figure we're supposed to believe in.  But appearance aside, he also lacks the appropriate gravitas in demeanor to champion a nation.  Guinevere has been updated to a modern woman status--she single handedly sets about righting the chaos in Camelot in very era inappropriate ways.  What strong independence!  This Camelot wants to exist as a politically correct entity.  In this land, children aren't used as commodities and women aren't exploited.  It's all so proper--but has nothing to do with the barbaric time in which this all transpires.  One particularly painful episode dealt solely with a teenage girl who was going to made to have relations with a powerful land boss.  Arthur and his crew liberated the town from such tyranny--when, in fact, such acts would be commonplace not abhorrent by medieval standards.  Even manipulative Merlin, as I mentioned above, doubles over in painful remorse and depression when his acts cause an unnecessary death.Playing to every modern day sensibility of right or wrong absolutely renders the time period details ineffectual.  Take, as a comparison point, HBO's brutal but stunning ""Game of Thrones.""  It is graphic and uncompromising, but also smart and sophisticated.  A definite must-see for adult viewers who crave powerful character driven drama.  ""Camelot,"" however, plays largely as a kid's fantasy with flashes of skin for grown-up viewers.  I still liked many elements--and thank goodness for the over-the-top zeal of Eva Green.  But the show muddies its message by playing it safe and then acting like it's dangerous.  2 1/2 stars.

The season finale left a really nice setup into subsequent seasons and a lot of possibilities.Eva Green's and Joseph Fiennes' characters as Morgan and Merlin were amazing. Arthur, on the other hand, is little hard to deal with in the first few episodes. I don't know if It's the acting or if he's written that big of an immature brat, but the rest of the cast and characters (excluding Guinivere) make it easier to overlook the senseless relationship Arthur and Guinivere start to develop.The plot setup for the first few episodes is original and engaging. While it does slow down from there until the end, I never found myself bored and always looked forward to the next episode. Arthur did become a lot more likeable as the season went on.But the real reason I watched the show lied in the complex and multifaceted characters of Morgan and Merlin. They left you wondering exactly what was going on underneath the exteriors they portrayed and the show brought a new dimension to these characters that I've never seen before. Morgan was seemingly painted as the cold-hearted villain, but I did not find this to be the case at all. She was so much more than just a bitter woman after the throne. Merlin is painted in mystery from the very beginning and as his story unfolded it left me wondering who was he exactly and could he really be trusted.As for realism, the legends of Arthur are mostly speculation and fiction anyway.

1413362,A36EW68H08UOCS,B004LROMSO,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[1, 3]","Cable networks began making television series that outstripped their network counterparts in almost all ways soon after the advent of cable.  The ability to show actual adult situations made shows like ""Six Feet Under""  and ""Sex and the City"" appear as refreshing and innovative as tv could be imagined when they appeared.  Soon after, cable took a larger leap of faith and produced a few lavish period pieces - like ""The Tudors"" and ""Rome"".  While these shows worked as television, they were incredibly expensive to produce and ""Rome"", for example, with production costs spread between HBO, the BBC and the Italian equivalent RAI, still had to close up shop.""Camelot"", comes from that tradition - produced by Starz and GK-TV.  It is replete with excellent costumes, cinematography and authentic-looking sets.But Camelot falls short of the glory of ""Rome"" and the conflict between the devious, treacherous Morgan and the magical Merlin- the centerpiece of this version of the Arthurian legend - pales in comparison to the real-life dramas of Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra and Henry VIII and his six wives and various advisors.King Arthur is among the most enduring English legends - there have been nearly 40 films centered on his tale, and no less than Henry VIII's father (Henry VII - the first Tudor King) named his first son Arthur so that the English people could more easily accept his successor.  Ironic that THIS Arthur - the older brother of Henry VIII - was the first husband of Catherine of Aragon, and it was THIS fact that formed the basis of Henry's justification for divorce from Catherine, separation from Rome, and all the brouhaha that followed).Joseph Fiennes leads the cast as a unique Merlin - rather than a long-bearded, pointy-capped wizard dispensing lightning bolts, this Merlin seems more man than wizard - a man both blessed and cursed with magic that exerts a price when wielded.  Eva Green chews the scenery as the scorned Morgan - the legitimate daughter of King Uther, who resents that Uther dispensed with her mother, cast Morgan aside, and secretly sired Arthur, who has been raised by an honorable family in the country.  James Purefoy, who shone as Marc Antony in ""Rome"" and in the excellent short-lived ""The Philanthropist"" adds needed gravitas in early episodes as Lot - Uther's enemy and tentative partner/ally with Morgan.In a series that begs for actors that bring a larger-than-life persona to the screen, the rest of the cast seemed to me at the level of a talented college theatrical production.The dialogue in Camelot is anachronistic - how could it not be - but while I could suspend my disbelief and immerse myself in the world of Caesars and Kings and Queens and Popes in these other productions... in ""Camelot"" I was always aware that I was watching skilful play-acting.If these other fine productions hadn't preceded it I would no doubt be singing the unqualified praises of ""Camelot"", but since we all stand on the shoulders of the giants who came before... this production feels like a step backward.",4,Camelot: The Costume Drama... not taken to new heights,1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,3060,"['Cable', 'networks', 'began', 'making', 'television', 'series', 'outstripped', 'network', 'counterparts', 'almost', 'ways', 'soon', 'advent', 'cable', 'ability', 'show', 'actual', 'adult', 'situations', 'made', 'shows', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Sex', 'City', 'appear', 'refreshing', 'innovative', 'tv', 'could', 'be', 'imagined', 'when', 'appeared', 'Soon', 'cable', 'took', 'larger', 'leap', 'faith', 'produced', 'few', 'lavish', 'period', 'pieces', 'Tudors', 'Rome', 'shows', 'worked', 'television', 'were', 'incredibly', 'expensive', 'produce', 'Rome', 'example', 'production', 'costs', 'spread', 'HBO', 'BBC', 'Italian', 'equivalent', 'RAI', 'still', 'had', 'close', 'up', 'shop', 'Camelot', 'tradition', 'produced', 'Starz', 'GK-TV', 'replete', 'excellent', 'costumes', 'cinematography', 'authentic-looking', 'sets.But', 'Camelot', 'short', 'glory', 'Rome', 'conflict', 'devious', 'treacherous', 'Morgan', 'magical', 'Merlin-', 'centerpiece', 'version', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'pales', 'comparison', 'real-life', 'dramas', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'Antony', 'Cleopatra', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'six', 'wives', 'various', 'advisors.King', 'Arthur', 'most', 'enduring', 'English', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', '40', 'films', 'centered', 'tale', 'less', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'father', 'Henry', 'VII', 'first', 'Tudor', 'King', 'named', 'first', 'son', 'Arthur', 'English', 'people', 'could', 'more', 'easily', 'accept', 'successor', 'Ironic', 'THIS', 'Arthur', 'older', 'brother', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'was', 'first', 'husband', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'was', 'THIS', 'fact', 'formed', 'basis', 'Henry', 'justification', 'divorce', 'Catherine', 'separation', 'Rome', 'brouhaha', 'followed', '.Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'cast', 'unique', 'Merlin', 'rather', 'long-bearded', 'pointy-capped', 'wizard', 'dispensing', 'lightning', 'bolts', 'Merlin', 'more', 'man', 'wizard', 'man', 'blessed', 'cursed', 'magic', 'price', 'when', 'wielded', 'Eva', 'Green', 'scenery', 'scorned', 'Morgan', 'legitimate', 'daughter', 'King', 'Uther', 'who', 'Uther', 'dispensed', 'mother', 'cast', 'Morgan', 'aside', 'secretly', 'sired', 'Arthur', 'who', 'been', 'raised', 'honorable', 'family', 'country', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'who', 'shone', 'Marc', 'Antony', 'Rome', 'excellent', 'short-lived', 'Philanthropist', 'needed', 'gravitas', 'early', 'episodes', 'Lot', 'enemy', 'tentative', 'partner/ally', 'Morgan.In', 'series', 'actors', 'bring', 'larger-than-life', 'persona', 'screen', 'rest', 'cast', 'seemed', 'level', 'talented', 'college', 'theatrical', 'production.The', 'dialogue', 'Camelot', 'anachronistic', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'could', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'immerse', 'world', 'Caesars', 'Kings', 'Queens', 'Popes', 'other', 'productions', 'Camelot', 'was', 'always', 'aware', 'was', 'watching', 'skilful', 'play-acting.If', 'other', 'fine', 'productions', 'had', ""n't"", 'preceded', 'would', 'doubt', 'be', 'singing', 'unqualified', 'praises', 'Camelot', 'stand', 'shoulders', 'giants', 'who', 'came', 'before', 'production', 'step', 'backward']",N/A
1413363,A4EFCH8II6U3P,B004LROMSO,Medraut,"[0, 2]","Starz gained alot of creds with Sparticus and so they wanted to creat another series. this a result, based on the Arthurian legend. which in the end I find to be a bit of a mixed bag. (Beware Spoilers to follow.)First off I am an avid reader of Arthuiran fiction. I've read Malory, Geoffery, Chretien, and others. I've seen the Arthurian based movies and series. (And written reviews on them. see my page). And I know that NO movie is going to be totaly close to the legend. there are some good versions but some just dont entirly capture the feel. there has been a definitive Robin Hood (Flynn), but not a definitive Arthur movie. there are good ones though. Point is I dont entirly expect this to be totaly close to the legend. which is not a bad thing, but something like this should have the essence of the subject matter. this has the elements and a few twists. some may claim that there is a bit of modern 'political correctness'. Maybe there is but thats nothing new. Its also not so 'modern'. esspessily to Arthurian fiction. one need simply read Chretien to know that. (And lets not forget his patron was the daughter of one of the most powerful of women in the Midevil period). There are other examples as well of strong women in Arthurian fiction. Look at the 'Wedding of Gawain', Malory's story of Sir Gareth would be nothing without the strong willed Linet, and so on.That is not to say this series has its faults. it does. for various reasons. before I get to that let me speak of the actors.At the top of the list is Joseph Fiennes as Merlin, Eva Green as Morgan, and Sinead Cusack as Sybil. these are by far the best of the cast meambers and really make the series. if you watch it then watch it for no other reason then these actors.Then there is Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur. at first he seems a bit of a fop, dishonorable, and unfit. yet as the sereies progresses his charture changes. for the better. he becomes the Arthur of legend. And maybe that's the point. that he starts out as reckless but becomes the hero he needs to be. still Fiennes excells as Merlin. he's clearly mad, not allways trust worthy, but loyal to the ideal of Camelot. Green is bitter, cunning, and strong willed. Cusack is another treat. her charture cares for Morgan as much as Merlin cares for Arthur. she is also intelligent and cunning. these main actors are what carry the series and are fun to watch. the others do a decent job, but some let the side down just a bit.Ultimatly in the end I can only reivew this series episode by episode. Because they have their good and bad points. I just cant review the series as a whole because of the jumble we get here. partly because of the writers, and other reasons.-Homecoming- Uther is slain, Morgan lusts for power and allies herself with Lot, and Merlin seeks out Arthur and tells him his true hertige. This episode has a lot of potential. some things are rather contrived. (It seems to quick for some of the knights to automaticly pledge their alleigance to Arthur.) Yet there is still the potential. Merlin has the dream of Camelot. he hopes Arthur will forfill this dream, and Arthur could become the king of legend, but there is a chance he wont. there is the possiblity he will fail. This is something I found to be interesting and they really could have worked on this angle a bit more. Arthur at first seems a typical reckless youth. he beds whatever woman he can get his hands on. he is awed and bewildered by what has been cast upon him. he dosent interly understand it all. yet he wants to do what is right. I think what lets the side down a bit is James Purefoy as Lot. He's not a bad actor. it's just his charture seems to familur to other roles he's played. his Lot is no different then Anthony in Rome for example. This is porbably my main complaint for this episode.-The Sword and the Crown- Arthur meets Guinevere, who he's been having dreams about. Morgan and Lot attack but Lot is defeated. Arthur claims the sword from the stone. Another good starter episode. the new telling of the sword in stone story is interesting and inventive. I also like that there are hints that Merlin set up this whole thing. Purefoy again lets the side down a bit again, but his charture meets his fate in the end. he beats Morgan, but is himself destroyed by Arthur. (Allthough you get the sense that if he had not lost to Arthur he would not have outlived Morgan). the highlight is really how Arthur is achiveing his inhertiance and Merlin's aid in this matter. Both Kay and Arthur have lost their only family to Lot. this angle could have been played up a bit more, as its a bit hard to really feel for the chatures.-Guinevere-These next two episodes I admit are not the best written. Leontes is one of the knights who serves Arthur. Kay and leontes seek out Gawain to come to Camelot, he reluctantly agrees. Arthur and Merlin are invited to feast with Morgan, which they do. merlin is himself taken prisoner. guinevere and Leontes are to be married but Arthur lusts after her. he wishes to be with her before her wedding. the twist here with Guinevere is that she is betrothed to Leontes, who himself willing serves Arthur. (This is all a whole twist on the Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot relationship). Morgan menwhile is using magic and it is costing her. the first thing I didnt care for is that Merlin and Arthur go to see Morgan without guards and are rather brazen. there seemed no good reason for this thinking. it was silly. of course they would be traped and tricked. aparently Arthur is just that blind about Morgan. aslo it is hard to see Arthur act in such a dishonrable manner. (and I see others think so too). He surrenders to his lust and risks everything. it didnt seem right.-Lady of the Lake- Arthur's sword is broken. Merlin seeks a new one from the swordmaker Caliburn, who wants to kill Arthur. his daughter, Excalibur, takes the sword but dies by accident in a lake. Merlin takes the sword from her dead hand. Arthur is upset that he cant be with Guinevere but she inspires him to do change things. While Morgan is ill there enters a nun, Syble (Cusack) who aids her. Again this is a weak episode. Caliburn's motives are rather murcky and it would have been nice if they were fleshed out. we need to know why he wants Arthur dead. it would have made the tragidy of his dauther's death more meaningful. however, I like Merlin's deceptive way of relating how he got the sword and establishes the legend. Arthur again isnt acting his best here. the highlight however is the introduction of Syble. it may be tempting for some viewers to give up at this point. I see some have, and I was almost tempted to as well. I encourage you to hang in there, the series improves.-Justice- Arthur and his knights look into a murder charge and they hold a trial, while Morgan minpulates merchants to come to her side. this is by far the better of episodes. this is where things start to improve and get better. here Arthur is acting as he should, as a man of honor. he is the Arthur of legend here. a man of the people who wants to improve his lands. yet at the same time Morgan uses cunning to change peoples minds using 'justice' to her own ends. Arthur uses justice to give hope. Morgan uses it to establish fear. this is a rather nice parrallel. this is one of my favorite episodes and agian its when things realy make their turning point. Arthur sees his own faults and sees he must do better. not only for himself but to others. I rather enjoyed this episode.-Three Journeys-Guinever travels to see her dying father, Arthur goes with her. Kay, Merlin, and some of the knights travel to Kay's home for a libary. A nun come to see Morgan telling her how Syble had burned down the nunnery. this is a rather interesting episode with different storys going on at once. on the one hand we have guinevere dealing with her father's death, the guilt for her actions, but her genuin love for Arthur. Arthur also loves her and is also guiltful. Kay is reluctant to go back home, but in the end finds beloved memorys of the past. merlin is incouraged to use magic rather then not use it. morgan is torn between admistering justice in front of everyone or punishing Syble, whome she cares for. it is another well written episode. I liked the mutliple storys going on and the chature devlopment.-The Long Night- Arthur and his court spends the night at Morgan's castle. she has various entertainments and stages a fake attack. at least time Arthur was smarter when visiting his sister. Merlin genuinly wants to go just for the sake of knowing what Morgan is planning. its interesting to see the 'staged' attack and how it effects the knights. Arthur genuinly believes it is real and wants to protect Morgan. all the while Morgan is discovering out the secrets of Camelot. in particular what happend with Arthur and Guinevere. its a nice little 'misleading' episode. at the end Igraine is taken prisoner and Morgan has taken her shape.-Igraine- As Igraine Morgan infiltrates Camelot. she seduces Merlin, exposes Guinevere, and all the while meets Igraine's friend a small orphined boy, Redwald. Igraine in the meantime uses all her wiles to escape and return to Camelot. Redwald is a nice chature a young dreamer. yet he sees Morgan's true self and by accident is killed. (those who dont like to see children harmed may not care for this episode.) It seems Morgan is genuinly affected by the boy, but the final scean shows her true colors. its a rather well written episode. showing how Igraine is and how Morgan precieves her. how Merlin cares for her and how he feels he is dangerous when people get to close to him. we see how a servant of Morgan is twisted in that love and convinced to stage an attack at the Bardon Pass. Vivian, Morgan's servant, however questions her misteresses actions. Syble however willing does all she hast to all for Morgan's sake. even though Green is not shown, her pressence is felt.-The Battle of Bardon Pass- (Bardon seems to me to be a refrence to the Battle of Badon, one of Arthur's well known victorys.) Morgan's troops attack the pass, Arthur and his men ride to defend the pass. Merlin finds out what Morgan has done, he and Igraine ride off to confront her, but are captured. Leontes in the meantime confronts both Guinever and Arthur. in the end it is Arthur alone who is left at the pass. This is a good episode. the only bit that lets the side down is Merlin and Igraine ridding off to confront Morgan. this seemed rather silly, and doomed to fail. the other bits were good. how the guilt of Arthur is exposed and how it effects the men. the battle sceans are well done. In the meantime Morgan is closer to achieving her goals.-Reckoning-Arthur alone defends the pass, it is believed he is slain. Morgan claims the crown. Leontes and the men return to aid Arthur, Leontes is slain. Arthur confronts Morgan. Syble takes the blame for all, and is executed. Morgan is left alone. Arthur and his men decide to honor Leontes and to achieve the goal that they set out to do. to creat a Camelot worthy of legend. Igraine in the meantime has been slain by Morgan and Merlin decides to leave. he sees that Arthur no longer needs him. this is the culmination of the series. we see that Arthur is becoming the man of legend, the man he was meant to be. it is fun to see him fight alone against so many. peace is gained between him and Leontes. all seems to be set to rights in Camelot. Arthur shows how he wants to give people peace, while Morgan gave them fear. he becomes the man the people and the land need. we see that he shall set up the legend that we all know. we even see the Round Table begining to be set up. Morgan, however, has taken Guinevere's shape and seduces Arthur. she departs, no dought to birth Mordred.So agian, in the end this is a bit of a mixed series. its not toatly bad, it just could have used more work in some areas. some things were well done, others could have been worked out better. there were parts that were not so well written that could have imporved. its all a jumble.over all Id say its a decent series. good. not terrible. but good. if you are interested give it a chance. it has potential.sadly this series lasted only one season. it was canceled for various reasons and there will be no second series.which is a pity. a few better episodes really could have helped this series.but you have to take what you can get. some episodes are quit enjoyable. others needed more

Honestly, Jamie Campbell Bower as a young Arthur grated on my nerves and I decided to forego the rest of the season.But when I had the chance to sit down with the DVD and watch the entire season, I admit that I was drawn into the story and found it to not be quite as bad as I anticipated (although that does not mean I would describe it as ""good"").The costumes and scenery are outstanding. I love the lavish sets and the gorgeous costumes. The writing...well, the writing comes off as something a young screenwriter might produce. The dialog is often forced and the characters use phrases that I am pretty sure were not in existence before, say, 1990. But Eva Green as Morgan is stunning. Green is beautiful and really manages to pull off the air of evil and vengeance. My eyes were glued to her whenever she was on screen. Joseph Fiennes is probably wasted in the role of Merlin. He chews the scenery and I wondered if he ended up in this role because he owed someone a favor. Jamie Campbell Bower never grew on me as Arthur. He just simply does not have the physical presence to play the king that would unite Camelot. He looks like a spoiled surfer boy who doesn't quite know what he is supposed to do next. I think the most annoying character for me was Tamsin Egerton's Guinevere; the character is woefully poorly written and has little to do either than look forelornly into the distance, rail against Arthur for some slight, or prance around nude. Depending on what you are in the mood for, this might just be the ticket though.Still, I give this season 3 stars because it did pull me in after all, which surprised me. I actually am somewhat disappointed that Starz did not order another season of the series because I would watch just to see what happens with Morgan.I thought I would hate the series and I ended up actually enjoying quite a few episodes.

1413366,A2D0I7M2G43WWP,B004LROMSO,Mena P.,"[14, 17]","*Two very mild spoilers below*You must understand, I am a big history buff. So when a friend and I went to the theater some time ago and I saw the trailer for this, I was both elated and saddened (as I don't have Starz.) When I learned that the brilliant mind that helped craft The Tudors, another of my favorite (albeit historically innacurate) series, I was on board, one hundred percent. And while I may have had to wait for streams to go up online to see it, you better believe I was waiting eagerly in front of my computer screen every weekend.The basic tale of King Arthur is known by all, so no need to repeat that. Here, King Uther has recently died, and his quick witted daughter Morgan sees this as her perfect opportunity to claim the throne she has so long coveted. Merlin, however, has something else in mind. Arthur, having been raised in the countryside unaware of his parentage, is quite surprised to find the sorcerer in his home spewing tales of being the son of a king. Merlin sees a future in this boy, a way to mend a country torn apart by warlord kings, and it will all start in one place, a crumbling stronghold that will stand as a beacon for a new era: Camelot.It's pretty much common knowledge that a lot of peopele don't like this series. Even as a fan, I admit there is some to be desired, and certain things could have gone better. But there is still a lot to appreciate.A big sore spot for a lot of people is the casting of Jamie Campbell Bower as the well known king. While yes, I'm sure someone out there could have carried the role better, this choice wasn't a horrible one. This Arthur is not the one we tend to immediately think of. This is a young, aloof Arthur, who doesn't know a damn thing about being king, and would frankly rather be at home with his foster family than thrust into the middle of medieval politics. Even halfway through the series, he's still coming into his own. Had the series continued, I feel like we'd have gotten to see different sides of him, and see him grow.There are, as to be expected, historical innacuracies. This is a medieval show, after all, and sometimes that is forgotten. A previous reviewer mentioned the episode where a young girl is nearly forced to offer up her virginity as compensation for the land she and her father live on. And they were right; in a teeny tiny medieval settlement like this town, this is commonplace. Even far after this time period, landowners were able require women's virginities as payment from those beneath them, and there was no denying a person who was above you in station. This is given a modern treatment of ""ohhh, that poor sweet child shouldn't have to give up her virginity to the big bad man"", and while in the end it turns out it is mostly because the two are secretly related, it still is something that would probably have never come to light in real life. Now, in the show's defense, as I said, this is a young Arthur, one who would probably still believe in childish idealism and who would undoubtedly take trouble with this sort of thing. On a completely different note, something that really irritated me is the big boo-boo that is Morgan's parentage. Morgan is the child of Igraine and the Duke of Cornwall, along with her sister Morgause. She is NOT a Pendragon.Despite the ups and downs, there are two shining gems that really make this show: Eva Green as Morgan, and Joseph Fiennes as Merlin. Firstly, this is a different Merlin than the wizened, bearded figure everybody imagines. This is a dark, brooding Merlin, one whose past is filled with sins and who may not be all that sane. The series seems to hint that the reason he hides his power is that it once got out of hand and killed his family, but this was never cleared up before the cancelation. Then, of course, my favorite part of the series, the goddess that is Eva Green. Not only is she stunningly beautiful, but she pulls off the role of cold, calculating enchantress like she was born for it.Really, I think that Camelot had many chips and cracks, but with a little patching up (that is, to say, more seasons) it could have had a lot of success. Every show starts off with baby steps, this one just never had a chance to work on its toddler years, so to speak.",4,The one that got away,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,4252,"['*Two', 'very', 'mild', 'spoilers', 'below*You', 'must', 'understand', 'am', 'big', 'history', 'buff', 'So', 'when', 'friend', 'went', 'theater', 'time', 'saw', 'trailer', 'was', 'elated', 'saddened', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Starz', 'When', 'learned', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'helped', 'craft', 'Tudors', 'favorite', 'historically', 'innacurate', 'series', 'was', 'board', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'wait', 'streams', 'go', 'up', 'online', 'see', 'better', 'believe', 'was', 'waiting', 'eagerly', 'front', 'computer', 'screen', 'weekend.The', 'basic', 'tale', 'King', 'Arthur', 'known', 'need', 'repeat', 'Here', 'King', 'recently', 'died', 'quick', 'witted', 'daughter', 'Morgan', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'claim', 'throne', 'so', 'long', 'coveted', 'Merlin', 'however', 'something', 'else', 'mind', 'Arthur', 'having', 'been', 'raised', 'countryside', 'unaware', 'parentage', 'quite', 'surprised', 'find', 'sorcerer', 'home', 'spewing', 'tales', 'being', 'son', 'king', 'Merlin', 'future', 'boy', 'way', 'mend', 'country', 'torn', 'apart', 'warlord', 'kings', 'will', 'start', 'one', 'place', 'crumbling', 'stronghold', 'will', 'stand', 'beacon', 'new', 'era', 'Camelot.It', 'pretty', 'much', 'common', 'knowledge', 'lot', 'peopele', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'series', 'Even', 'fan', 'admit', 'be', 'desired', 'certain', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'better', 'still', 'lot', 'appreciate.A', 'big', 'sore', 'spot', 'lot', 'people', 'casting', 'Jamie', 'Campbell', 'Bower', 'well', 'known', 'king', 'yes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'someone', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'carried', 'role', 'better', 'choice', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'one', 'Arthur', 'not', 'one', 'tend', 'immediately', 'think', 'young', 'aloof', 'Arthur', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'damn', 'thing', 'being', 'king', 'would', 'frankly', 'rather', 'be', 'home', 'foster', 'family', 'thrust', 'middle', 'medieval', 'politics', 'Even', 'halfway', 'series', 'still', 'coming', 'own', 'Had', 'series', 'continued', 'feel', ""'d"", 'have', 'gotten', 'see', 'different', 'sides', 'see', 'grow.There', 'are', 'be', 'expected', 'historical', 'innacuracies', 'medieval', 'show', 'sometimes', 'forgotten', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'episode', 'where', 'young', 'girl', 'nearly', 'forced', 'offer', 'up', 'virginity', 'compensation', 'land', 'father', 'live', 'were', 'right', 'teeny', 'tiny', 'medieval', 'settlement', 'town', 'commonplace', 'Even', 'far', 'time', 'period', 'landowners', 'were', 'able', 'require', 'women', 'virginities', 'payment', 'was', 'denying', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'station', 'given', 'modern', 'treatment', 'ohhh', 'poor', 'sweet', 'child', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'give', 'up', 'virginity', 'big', 'bad', 'man', 'end', 'out', 'mostly', 'two', 'are', 'secretly', 'related', 'still', 'something', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'never', 'come', 'light', 'real', 'life', 'Now', 'show', 'defense', 'said', 'young', 'Arthur', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'probably', 'still', 'believe', 'childish', 'idealism', 'who', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'take', 'trouble', 'sort', 'thing', 'completely', 'different', 'note', 'something', 'really', 'irritated', 'big', 'boo-boo', 'Morgan', 'parentage', 'Morgan', 'child', 'Igraine', 'Duke', 'Cornwall', 'sister', 'Morgause', 'NOT', 'Pendragon.Despite', 'ups', 'downs', 'are', 'two', 'shining', 'gems', 'really', 'make', 'show', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Morgan', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Merlin', 'Firstly', 'different', 'Merlin', 'wizened', 'bearded', 'figure', 'everybody', 'dark', 'brooding', 'Merlin', 'one', 'past', 'filled', 'sins', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'sane', 'series', 'hint', 'reason', 'power', 'once', 'got', 'hand', 'killed', 'family', 'was', 'never', 'cleared', 'up', 'cancelation', 'Then', 'course', 'favorite', 'part', 'series', 'goddess', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Not', 'only', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'role', 'cold', 'calculating', 'enchantress', 'was', 'born', 'it.Really', 'think', 'Camelot', 'had', 'many', 'chips', 'cracks', 'little', 'patching', 'up', 'say', 'more', 'seasons', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'success', 'Every', 'show', 'baby', 'steps', 'one', 'just', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'work', 'toddler', 'years', 'so', 'speak']",N/A

1413369,A3T5NSG7LMRY0A,B004LROMSO,Michael Gmirkin,"[0, 2]","Well, it would seem that they have decided to re-make the Arthurian legend into a modern costume drama like Spartacus and some of the others currently in vogue.It's passable. Though ""Arthur"" seems little more than a whiny peasant boy in the first season. I'm hoping that if they make more seasons he'll ""grow the heck up"" a bit. If not, this show may be doomed. Other than some gratuitous sex scenes (it was made by Starz, after all), it doesn't seem to have a whole lot going for it yet.Others have noted that it's a bit revisionist and overly 'politically correct' with modern sensibilities rather than being completely authentic to the supposed time period. Though, given the Arthurian legend's general emphasis on 'justice/equality for all,' I suppose it's forgivable that modern notions of the same should creep in.It does come with a few featurettes, if you're into that. I don't know if it's enough to 'save' the show.If you liked the show, you'll probably like the DVDs as they're pretty competently transferred. There's the usual Play All feature, though it would be nice if the intros and credits could be optionally left out when playing all, to save on having to skip around or fast forward. As far as the discs themselves go, I didn't find much to complain about.So, I guess it's just down to whether or not you like the show. Not my cup of tea, personally. Though, seeing Claire Forlani in a new role wasn't unwelcome, even if they did kill her off at the end of the show. Speaking of which, there were a lot of ""oh, come on!"" moments through out, not least of all being Igraine's (Forlani's) death scene. I could help myself when rather than naming her murderer to Merlin, she yammers on about pretty much everything else under the sun before finally dying. Seriously?

1413370,A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,B004LROMSO,"Michelle L. Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[0, 3]","Woven throughout this familiar tale of Camelot and King Arthur are new twists/variations that should appeal to most, even if you aren't familiar with the various versions of the story. Of course those who are familiar will recognize the central characters: Guinevere (Tamsin Egerton), King Arthur (Jamie Bower), Lady Igraine (Claire Forlani), and Merlin (Joseph Fiennes). But there are some new characters: Arthur's brother Kay (Peter Mooney) and his betrayed champion, Leontes (Philip Winchester). There are the familiar themes of: sibling rivalry (one the illegitimate/reluctant ruler, and the other an ambitious vixen), the never-ending struggle between good and evil, sprinkled with tons of jealousy, betrayal and treachery; but there are new twists as well. Merlin isn't the stereotypical ""magic-using"" wizard, but instead comes across as a tortured/soul searching sorcerer but who is frightened of his own power , but who has grand ideas of rebuilding a nation, and creating a King. Merlin, driven to sometimes do the wrong thing for the right reasons, is perhaps the most endearing character in the entire series. Actor Joseph Fiennes brings a vulnerability to the role that I thought was unique. He could brood, pout, rant and rave, and yet you sympathize with him because he doesn't trust himself to use his power for fear that he will not be able to control himself. And while Bower doesn't exactly invoke the King Arthur image at first glance, he does bring a certain recklessness to the role that was refreshing. He's rash, impetuous, makes tons of mistakes, and does things without thinking of the consequences, but yet you still sympathize with his character because underneath it all you realize that he, although a King, is human too. He merely wants to belong and be loved, even if that means trusting unconditionally a half-sister who means him harm. Eva Green's portrayal of Morgan (Arthur's half sister) is chilling, and while she comes across as evil and dastardly, she does show us moments of vulnerability that evoke sympathy. You still dislike her, but you do understand her. And finally, one of the most subtle and endearing characters in the story (besides Merlin) is Leontes, whose faith (in God) and moral compass makes the viewer cheer for him with the hope that he will escape his fate (spoiler...which he doesn't). Leontes' betrayal shows you just how there can be tension between duty, honor and forgiveness.Now a critique of the story, which has been done but I will put my spin on it. Young Arthur was raised by a family who did not tell him of his royal heritage, but yet he grows up spoiled and inconsiderate. He takes what he wants, when he wants.  Up until this point, Arthur has gone thru life recklessly, and yet with this new responsibility he appears to be maturing. His saving grace is his (adopted) brother who loves him unconditionally but also recognizes his weaknesses and forgives him. Anyway, when King Uther (who has battled his own demons...lust for a woman that wasn't his and loathing for a daughter who wants to be loved) dies , Merlin comes calling demanding that Arthur take his rightful place on the throne. The only problem is that Uther's exhiled daughter, Morgan Pendragon, feels hurt and betrayed and believes that she is the rightful heir to the throne, especially since she went thru all the trouble to use sorcery and magic to poison him. She has been making her own alliances, building her own army, all while assuming  that she will be Britian's new ruler. The question is what price will she pay for the magic she uses to manipulate and control those around her? She doesn't intend to let Merlin (a sorcerer who afraid to use his power) or her illegitimate half-brother Arthur to stand in her way. The viewer will enjoy the tension that exists between Merlin and his power. While initially he appears noble, at times he is misguided, and while his intentions are good, his actions don't always reflect that. He constantly struggles not to give into his urges and desires. Instead he wants to unite a kingdom, under one ruler and return Camelot to its original glory. There are some other interesting plots in the series, but you will have to watch it for yourself.What I enjoyed most about this story was the underlying theme (while not new) that everything is not as it seems). People can be fooled (literally and figuratively) into making poor decisions, especially if it is something that they want or desire (Morgan as Lady Ingraine....Morgan as a girl...Morgan as Guinevere). I also enjoyed the explanation of how certain myths and tales were embellished to foster hope and kinship. The storyteller also took several creative liberties and changed reintroduced the various myths that we thought we knew (the lady in the lake and the sword in the stone). The only thing that I wished to see was a change in the role of Guinevere. While Egerton is incredibly beautiful, I thought that they could have done so much more with her character. She was the typical Guinevere, beguiling and yet we knew she would yield to temptation. While on the surface she appears/pretends to be noble and strong, she also comes across as fickle and confused about what she really wants. After all, she is attracted to Arthur, and yet feels an obligation to marry Leontes (who she has dated since childhood), only to later betray him.Although there was nothing too-too original about this adaptation of the traditional story of King Arthur, there were a few new nuances that enhance the story, not to mention some  decent actors, who work well with the material they were given. There are a few slow parts, but overall there are enough fight and love scenes that kept the story moving. The DVD also offered some extras that included bloopers and interviews with the actors. At the end of the day, I don't regret those hours that I spent watching the show and the good parts (scenery, acting, etc) definitely outweighed the bad/slow parts. This version of Camelot definitely is worth watching as a marathon on a Sunday.",4,SOME new twists on a familiar tale.,1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,6067,"['Woven', 'familiar', 'tale', 'Camelot',

Another fantasy?  Or Mad Men, the winding down Sopranos, The Big C or a comedy, perhaps.  And besides, you know all about the legend of King Arthur, you've seen the movies Camelot and Excalibur, right?  Well, wrong.Just because something is named Camelot doesn't mean you've seen it before.  The British say, ""You can do anything you want with King Arthur, as long as you never make him the villain.""  And this series decided to remake King Arthur in a way you hadn't thought of before.  Well, partly, but coming from a completely different direction.First, Arthur is not blindingly cute nor is he devastatingly handsome.  This Arthur is a pleasant-looking young blonde man who has to make himself stand out and be looked up to for his courage and thinking.  Guinevere is a simple, beautiful young lass who is marrying another man and Morgan is the unloved older sister who has gotten everything wrong in her mind and turned to magic to right the misunderstood wrongs.  All of these people and the rest of the cast flit through your imagination as you watch them on the screen.  You are even surprised to find that Camelot, itself, is an old ruin of a Roman castle with part of the roof missing and overgrown with vines.  Poor Arthur really has to start from scratch!The writers decided not to choose between the sword-in-the-stone and the-lady-of-the-lake.  They managed to write a very interesting take on both!  No real sorcery involved in either.  But Arthur is lead to believe there is and what we believe is what makes us what we are.The scenery is gorgeous, the CGI is not overly used and the actors are wonderful.  You are easily drawn into this story and want to know more.  Plus it has the sexiness of The Games of Thrones, to appeal to the adult audience, not for children.  In the first season, like GoT, there is not yet a full scale battle scene, but very clever skirmishes.  The way Arthur handles an entire group of foe on his own will delight you.  You will say, ""Yes.  Arthur does deserve to be king!""Ah, you think, where is Merlin?  Yes.  Well.  There is the rub.  You can take a great actor, like Joseph Fiennes, and if he is given a bad script, he caun't save the character.  Or maybe, Fiennes was totally miscast.  As an Arthurian fan, and you most like are or you wouldn't be checking this show out, you know that Merlin does not necessarily mean pointed hat, long white beard and flowing gown with stars and moons.  But he should do something besides feel sorry for himself while gloating as well.  He might as well have been wearing a hair shirt and walked around flogging himself.  There is a way to present inner turmoil mixed with duty that is not depressing.  In no way can we feel sorry for this Merlin.So, why did this well-written, beautifully filmed (in Ireland), wonderfully acted programme not get a second season?  Well, I believe that mainly you can find the answer in the first paragraph.  On the other hand, it could have been Merlin.  However, as far as the series goes, you will really enjoy it and, since you already know the story, the ending will satisfy you, if not leaving you feeling a bit sorry not to find out poor Arthur and Guinevere's reactions when they find out the truth about Morgan!  But if you are captivated by the Arthurian legend anyway, you can most likely go to another website and read lots of fanfic carrying on the story in varying degrees...or, hey, write your own!",5,The REAL Game of Thrones,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,3544,"['So', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Borgias', 'Spartacus', 'now', 'time', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'fantasy', 'Mad', 'Men', 'winding', 'down', 'Sopranos', 'Big', 'C', 'comedy', 'perhaps', 'know', 'legend', 'King', 'Arthur', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'Camelot', 'Excalibur', 'right', 'Well', 'wrong.Just', 'something', 'named', 'Camelot', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'British', 'say', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'want', 'King', 'Arthur', 'as', 'long', 'never', 'make', 'villain', 'series', 'decided', 'remake', 'King', 'Arthur', 'way', 'had', ""n't"", 'thought', 'before', 'Well', 'partly', 'coming', 'completely', 'different', 'direction.First', 'Arthur', 'not', 'blindingly', 'cute', 'devastatingly', 'handsome', 'Arthur', 'pleasant-looking', 'young', 'blonde', 'man', 'who', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'be', 'looked', 'up', 'courage', 'thinking', 'Guinevere', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'young', 'lass', 'who', 'marrying', 'man', 'Morgan', 'unloved', 'older', 'sister', 'who', 'gotten', 'everything', 'wrong', 'mind', 'turned', 'magic', 'right', 'misunderstood', 'wrongs', 'people', 'rest', 'cast', 'flit', 'imagination', 'watch', 'screen', 'are', 'even', 'surprised', 'find', 'Camelot', 'old', 'ruin', 'Roman', 'castle', 'part', 'roof', 'missing', 'overgrown', 'vines', 'Poor', 'Arthur', 'really', 'start', 'scratch', 'writers', 'decided', 'not', 'choose', 'sword-in-the-stone', 'the-lady-of-the-lake', 'managed', 'write', 'very', 'interesting', 'take', 'real', 'sorcery', 'involved', 'Arthur', 'lead', 'believe', 'what', 'believe', 'what', 'what', 'are.The', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'CGI', 'not', 'overly', 'used', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'are', 'easily', 'drawn', 'story', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'sexiness', 'Games', 'Thrones', 'appeal', 'adult', 'audience', 'not', 'children', 'first', 'season', 'GoT', 'not', 'yet', 'full', 'scale', 'battle', 'scene', 'very', 'clever', 'skirmishes', 'way', 'Arthur', 'entire', 'group', 'foe', 'own', 'will', 'delight', 'will', 'say', 'Yes', 'Arthur', 'deserve', 'be', 'king', 'Ah', 'think', 'where', 'Merlin', 'Yes', 'Well', 'rub', 'can', 'take', 'great', 'actor', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'given', 'bad', 'script', 'cau', ""n't"", 'save', 'character', 'maybe', 'Fiennes', 'was', 'totally', 'miscast', 'Arthurian', 'fan', 'most', 'like', 'are', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'checking', 'show', 'out', 'know', 'Merlin', 'not', 'necessarily', 'mean', 'pointed', 'hat', 'long', 'white', 'beard', 'flowing', 'gown', 'stars', 'moons', 'should', 'do', 'something', 'feel', 'sorry', 'while', 'gloating', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'wearing', 'hair', 'shirt', 'walked', 'flogging', 'way', 'present', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'mixed', 'duty', 'not', 'depressing', 'way', 'can', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Merlin.So', 'why', 'did', 'well-written', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'Ireland', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'programme', 'not', 'get', 'second', 'season', 'Well', 'believe', 'mainly', 'can', 'find', 'answer', 'first', 'paragraph', 'other', 'hand', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Merlin', 'However', 'as', 'far', 'series', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'ending', 'will', 'satisfy', 'not', 'leaving', 'feeling', 'bit', 'sorry', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'poor', 'Arthur', 'Guinevere', 'reactions', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'Morgan', 'are', 'captivated', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'anyway', 'can', 'most', 'likely', 'go', 'website', 'read', 'lots', 'fanfic', 'carrying', 'story', 'varying', 'degrees', 'hey', 'write', 'own']",N/A

There's some saucy, sensual scenes in here as well as your usual run of violence and the settings are well done but I need to look at more than sunsets and this series just doesn't have it.

This time its a miniseries from Starz and GK-TV that features a primarily younger cast, with some violence, some nudity and lots of drama.  All the main characters are back, from Merlin to Arthur to Guinevere.  The emphasis in this version of Arthur is the relationship between Arthur and his half-sister Morgan, and the political intrigue the latter pursues to defeat the former.

Mann,"[0, 3]","I'm not a big fan of the Camelot legend, and that fact might well be important since I see quite a few reviews from people who are thoroughly dissatisfied with the series. I found the series generally fun and enjoyable. Though the ostensible focus of the series is on the young King Arthur, who ascends to the throne after his father, Uther, is assassinated by Arthur's half-sister, Morgan, the star of this show is Joseph Fiennes, who steals the show with a compelling portrayal of Merlin, the reluctant sorcerer. The basic premise of the first season is Arthur's attempt to establish his reign, primarily by doing good for the people who would be his subjects. In this effort, he exhibits quite a bit of twenty-first-century sensibility, something I can see bothering people.The central tension throughout the season is provided captivatingly by Eva Green in the role of Morgan, Uther's daughter and Arthur's half-sister. She believes the throne is rightfully hers and plots frequently to claim her right. Arthur, for the most part, naively hopes that he can embrace his sister and the two can be united in their aim to help the people. Jamie Campbell Bower, as Arthur, seemed to me initially miscast, but I must say he grew on me and ultimately seemed effective. Tamsin Egerton, however, as Guinevere, seemed ineffective, not because of anything she does wrong per se but because of the way her character has been re-envisioned with feminist sensibilities that seem greatly misplaced for the period in which this show is set. Then again, I felt the same thing about Rose inTitanic, and that film seemed to do OK financially.The look of the show is generally excellent, from Camelot to Castle Pendragon to the countryside settings. It should be noted, though, that this retelling of the legend is hardly a family-friendly affair. The language is coarse at times, the nudity is abundant, and the simulated sexual scenes arise frequently.",4,"Fun, well acted, and good looking",1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,1938,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Camelot', 'legend', 'fact', 'might', 'well', 'be', 'important', 'see', 'quite', 'few', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'dissatisfied', 'series', 'found', 'series', 'generally', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'ostensible', 'focus', 'series', 'young', 'King', 'Arthur', 'who', 'throne', 'father', 'Uther', 'assassinated', 'Arthur', 'half-sister', 'Morgan', 'star', 'show', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'who', 'show', 'compelling', 'portrayal', 'Merlin', 'reluctant', 'sorcerer', 'basic', 'premise', 'first', 'season', 'Arthur', 'attempt', 'establish', 'reign', 'primarily', 'doing', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'subjects', 'effort', 'quite', 'bit', 'twenty-first-century', 'sensibility', 'something', 'can', 'see', 'bothering', 'people.The', 'central', 'tension', 'season', 'provided', 'captivatingly', 'Eva', 'Green', 'role', 'Morgan', 'Uther', 'daughter', 'Arthur', 'half-sister', 'throne', 'rightfully', 'hers', 'plots', 'frequently', 'claim', 'right', 'Arthur', 'most', 'part', 'naively', 'can', 'embrace', 'sister', 'two', 'can', 'be', 'united', 'aim', 'help', 'people', 'Jamie', 'Campbell', 'Bower', 'Arthur', 'seemed', 'initially', 'miscast', 'must', 'say', 'grew', 'ultimately', 'seemed', 'effective', 'Tamsin', 'Egerton', 'however', 'Guinevere', 'seemed', 'ineffective', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'se', 'way', 'character', 'been', 're-envisioned', 'feminist', 'sensibilities', 'seem', 'greatly', 'misplaced', 'period', 'show', 'set', 'Then', 'again', 'felt', 'same', 'thing', 'Rose', 'inTitanic', 'film', 'seemed', 'do', 'OK', 'financially.The', 'look', 'show', 'generally', 'excellent', 'Camelot', 'Castle', 'Pendragon', 'countryside', 'settings', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'though', 'retelling', 'legend', 'hardly', 'family-friendly', 'affair', 'language', 'coarse', 'times', 'nudity', 'abundant', 'simulated', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'arise', 'frequently']",N/A

1413388,A4FX5YCJA630V,B004LROMSO,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","On the surface, it seemed like a great idea: an adult retelling of the Arthurian legends, with a cast of great actors, a huge budget and an attempt to deconstruct the familiar stories surrounding King Arthur and his court. But for a number of reasons ""Camelot"" didn't deliver.When King Uther dies, a power vacuum opens in his wake, out of which emerge two contenders to the throne: his legitimate daughter Morgan, who was taken from her home after her mother's death and sent to a convent, and his bastard son Arthur, conceived before marriage on Uther's second wife Igraine and fostered out in secret to a humble peasant family.Both of them have a claim to the kingdom, but extreme sibling rivalry ensues when Morgan decides the crown is hers alone. In Arthur's corner is the sorcerer Merlin, a manipulative trickster who has a number of ploys designed to strengthen Arthur's reputation among the people, though they're constantly hindered by Arthur himself, who often seems more interested in pursuing ladies than ruling a kingdom. On Morgan's side is her own wit, cunning and ever-growing magical powers. As she moves from one scheme to the next in her attempt to displace her brother, she calls upon darker and more dangerous magic in order to consolidate her claim to the throne - magic which takes its toll on her.It all seems a brilliant set-up, in which the writers propose to deconstruct the ideals that we associate with Arthurian legend and put a fresh spin on the well-known story. The show not only demythologizing elements such as the Sword in the Stone, the Lady of the Lake and the Round Table, but also tears apart the heroic image we have of so many iconic characters. This unfortunately, is where it goes wrong.In their attempt to play around with the archetypal notion we have of King Arthur, they end up characterizing him as a whiny, horny, gormless, deceitful creep - whilst still expecting us to root for him as the show's protagonist. His very first scene portrays him having sex with his brother's girlfriend in broad daylight in an open field (and being completely unrepentant about it afterwards) and later on he sets his sights on the fianc&eacute;e (then wife) of his most loyal knight. He trusts the wrong people, he makes dumb decisions, he throws temper tantrums, and at all times he seems completely over his head.Meanwhile Morgan, despite several questionable moral shortcomings, actually seems more suited to ruling than her brother - she's certainly more invested in the crown, eager to win the people's approval and aware of the responsibility of ruling. Watching her wiles and manipulations are perhaps the most enjoyable part of the entire show, helped along by the relish and charisma with which Eva Green plays her part.The writers decide to invert the famous Arthurian love triangle by having Guinevere married to a knight called Leontes and portray Arthur as the interloper. Not a bad idea, but it's handled terribly. The show would have us believe that Arthur and Guinevere yearn for each other with a passion that cannot possibly be denied - even though their interaction consists of two short conversations and a dream. They then have sex in a cave on the very morning that Guinevere is to be married to another man, and after she goes through with the wedding, Arthur pushes her up against a wall and demands to know whether her new husband is better in bed than he is. Wow, how romantic. What woman wouldn't fall for a guy like that?Now, a protagonist doesn't always have to be likeable - heck, sometimes they can be downright villainous. But to characterize Arthur in this way whilst still expecting the audience to buy him as a sympathetic hero just doesn't work, and despite the inordinate amount of time spent on it, his ""great love"" for Guinevere is about as deep as a paddling pool. You've heard of the saying ""show, don't tell"", right? Well, this show hasn't.Though the production values are high, and everything looks very sleek and glossy, the scripts leave a lot to be desired, with plot holes galore (Morgan kills her father by poisoning a communal bowl - so how come no one else died? And how could she be sure he would eat from it? That's in just the first five minutes of the very first episode) and plenty of clich&eacute;d and/or banal dialogue. When Arthur expresses his misgivings to Merlin, asking: ""What if they don't accept me?"" Merlin's reply is: ""They must."" Wow, that's helpful. Later, Arthur says much the same thing to Leontes, and is told: ""Trust your instincts."" ""What if I don't have the instincts of a king?"" ""Perhaps you do and you just don't know it."" Great advice.Likewise, there is a clumsy attempt to blend gritty realism with contemporary values, which means that alongside gory fight scenes and explicit sex scenes, we have Guinevere spouting modern rhetoric, such as: ""I'm not sure what love means,"" and Arthur declaring that his kingdom stands for nebulous concepts such as ""freedom for all"" and that ""no one belongs to anyone"", principals which would have been incomprehensible to people in the Middle Ages, and which to sound trite to contemporary ears. The show could have picked one or the other, but having the characters pay lip-service to modern ideals whilst getting up to some extremely sordid behavior results in a completely garbled tone. We end up with a show as anachronistic asRobin HoodorMerlin, but without the tongue-in-cheek winks to the audience. Camelot wants to be taken seriously, whilst simultaneously being remarkably silly.(And for the record, throwing in a few gratuitous sex and nude scenes doesn't make a show more mature, darker, or richer. In this case, it has quite the opposite effect: of people trying too hard to seem grown-up. Some of the shots are downright funny, such as Guinevere rising from the ocean in a sheer wet dress, revolving slowly so the camera can get a good look at her backside *and* her breasts).The episodes just sort of meander along without any real sense of forward momentum (some of the more pointless subplots include the knights bringing books from a hidden library back to Camelot, Guinevere going to visit her dying father, and Leontes/Morgan having some sort of weird encounter with a magical wolf in the forest that is never explained) and by the end of the series we're left with a cliff-hanger that will never be resolved thanks to the show's imminent cancellation.There are some good performances here and there - the aforementioned Eva Green as Morgan, and Joseph Fiennes who hams it up as Merlin. Peter Mooney is an appealing Kay (you'll be left wondering why *he* wasn't crowned king instead of his brother) and several original characters such as Sybil the mysterious nun and Bridget the sensible handmaiden have intriguing dynamics with main characters that should have been fleshed-out better. I was initially intrigued by the presence of Claire Forlaini as Arthur's mother Igraine considering almost all versions of Arthurian legend have her die in childbirth - but these writers don't bother to explore her relationship with her long-lost son at all.In short, it was a good idea that simply wasn't executed properly. The wrong characters are unlikeable, the dialogue doesn't sound natural, the plot doesn't go anywhere until the last two episodes, Arthur and Guinevere look (and sound) far too modern, and much of the stuff that happens simply doesn't make sense. Despite the liberal ideals that the show espouses, the women are ogled by the cameras in the sleaziest way possible, and Arthur's single black knight is naturally the first to be killed off in battle (and nobody even bothers to take his body back to Camelot or even give him proper burial).Arthur's characterization could have worked if the writers had been aware of it; if say Arthur was *meant* to be a loathsome brat that Merlin was struggling to portray in a positive light for the sake of public relations, with Morgan doing her best to expose her half-brother for his true self. With Merlin and Morgan as the real protagonists, the deconstruction of the legends could have been focused on their fight over this pawn and their attempt to gain control of the kingdom from behind the throne.As it is, the show attempts to have its cake and eat it too. I'd suggest giving this one a miss.",2,"""Destiny Must Be Won!""",1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,8317,"['surface', 'seemed', 'great', 'idea', 'adult', 'retelling', 'Arthurian', 'legends', 'cast',

It's a very ambitious project, but unfortunately, it pales somewhat in comparison to similar ""medieval"" themed series such as GAME OF THRONES.  It just feels a bit rushed.  To be honest, the production values are roughly on par with shows like XENA and HERCULES...but in those shows, the cheesiness was part of the fun.  Here, it is a distraction.CAMELOT tells the familiar tale of young King Arthur.  In fact, in many ways, it tells the story in much the way that the great John Boorman film EXCALIBUR did.  It tries for a gritty, slightly graphic (both in terms of violence and sex) approach...and I appreciate that.  Arthur is not just some shiny ""good guy"" but is full of foibles and faults, particularly in the early going when he feels so very uncertain about his task and his own abilities.There are some familiar faces.  I had initially been very optimistic about Joseph Fiennes playing Merlin...but his performance is over-the-top and really shows no effort on his part to build a credible character. Eva Green LOOKS great as Merlin's foil Morgana...but she's never been much of an actress and doesn't bring much heft or real menace to the role.The show has lovely locations and pretty terrific costumes, I must say.  It is just very pleasant to look at.  In the end, I think shoddy writing and low-budget effects make this only passably watchable.  I'm not a huge Arthurian Legend buff, just a casual fan.  This show might generate more enjoyement from hard core appreciators of those stories.

This insipid, horribly written, atrociously acted slap in the face of  Arthurian legend began on a promising note with it's attention to the gritty world of 5th and 6th century Britain.  But as each episode progressed, it became sillier and sillier, mired in it's inability to extract an Arthur that compels our attention or a cohesive story line.  Much as been said of Eva Green's performance, but it is so over the top it renders her role as Morgan almost laughable. She and Joseph Fiennes are wasted in this production, and it is not their fault: they were forced to speak what the writers put in their mouths.All in all, this is a series to be avoided at all costs.

Merlin is more mastermind than wizard (though there is some darker magic in this series), Arthur is a young boy prone to rashness, and in general things are steeped in quite a bit of drama.The show offers many twists to the normal stories, the biggest of which is that Guinevere is married and her love affair with Arthur is just that: an affair.The show is usually entertaining, but it suffers as so many shows do from not having enough happen each episode. There's drama and tension but not enough plot. Then again, if drama and romantic entanglement are your thing, or if you have a particular love for the medieval setting, this show will be right up your alley.And let's not forget the fact that since it was on Starz, there's violence and nudity aplenty.

1413393,A3MM2R92F6NCLJ,B004LROMSO,Scott,"[0, 3]","Let me start by saying what works: Eva Green is wonderful as Morgan as she finds the right edge of gravitas vs. ham for the production. Tamsin Egerton also does a nice job as the torn-between-two-lovers Guinevere and Sean Pertwee is his usual solid self as Ector. It always surprises me that Pertwee hasn't had more roles in major productions as he's a terrific supporting actor/sidekick. Instead he seems destined for cameos where he's either killed immediately or gets very little screen time. Claire Forlani as a matronly character threw me off at first but she did a nice job. The other supporting characters are pretty good too though Clive Standen irks me as too over-the-top as he usually does. It was nice to see Chipo Chung playing a more mundane role rather than prefacing every sentence with Chan-Tho or trying to put a time-stealing bug on Donna's back.The cinematography is solid and the editing is good. It's a nice production.That works, and it's a pretty large list. However, I have yet to mention the three biggest contributors to the story: The writer, Arthur and Merlin. That's where ""Camelot"" has its issues.  Chris Chibnall seems to lose focus in whatever he writes at times and it really throws off the story. At different points it becomes an utter mess while never adding tension to the overall arch. It seems the other writers have to get things back on track.Joseph Fiennes as Merlin is also a major letdown. There's much speculation that Merlin was actually a druid instead of a traditional wizard. Maybe that's what Fiennes was going for because his performance can best be described as wooden. There's a difference between playing a character trying to suppress his emotions and passions vs. a character that simply has none. Fiennes' Merlin often seems the latter while the script is the former.That brings us to Arthur, actor Jamie Campbell Bower. My question is this: What were they thinking? Campbell Bower has no screen presence and invokes no other image than a skeezy little junkie slacker. While rising from humble beginnings is a staple in storytelling useless, uncharismatic dirtbag to king stretches credulity too far, as does trying to suspend disbelief that's he's some sort of ladies man.All-in-all ""Camelot"" got the little things right.

There seems to be a substantial amount of negative comparison by many reviewers of Camelot to a show called Game of Thrones, and some degree to another, Spartacus. I don't have any premium TV, just basic channels, thus have no idea how accurate those comparisons are.So. Here's what I did. Even though I am somewhat familiar with Arthurian legend, I cast that knowledge aside so I could just view this series on its own entertainment merit. Simply approached it as a never before heard, or seen, legendary tale. And guess what? For pure raw entertainment, I found it to actually be pretty good. The acting is fine, the characters are fully fleshed (!), the plot is compelling, the dialogue intriguing, the scenery (and overall cinematography) breathtaking, and the costumes are absolutely, stunningly incredible (though I am sure detractors will complain about authenticity of those, too). Frankly, I don't care. The series has scenery, secrets, swordplay, sex. Merlin and Morgan are riveting. Arthur's men are exceedingly easy on the eyes. My attention was engaged, I wanted to know what was going to happen next, and I was transported while watching Camelot. That's what I consider real, escapist entertainment. And that's exactly what I am looking for after spending a crazy week at work, here in the 21st century.The one complaint I have is the third disc - the last one, would not play in either our dvd player or on my husband's computer.

1413396,A3KHJGJHFUSHY0,B004LROMSO,"Shane Silk ""Book & Film Lover""","[3, 8]","This series based on the legend of Camelot is very well-done: beautiful production, authentic costumes, great acting and interesting plot. All the men playing the knights are excellent in their roles, all testesterone and manly in their portrayals. Philip Winchester particularly stands out as Leonites with high morals and a true faith and sense of honor. Clive Standon Gawain is all macho knighthood and Peter Mooney as King Arthur's brother gives the show a sense of family. Joseph Fiennes is brilliant as Merlin and gives his character a sense of magic and mystery. The women of Camelot are all beautiful and perfectly cast in their respective roles. Some reviews on here critisized Jamie Campbell Bower as King Arthur, but I think he was right for the role. He is supposed to be a boy-man plucked from obscurity and placed on the throne. He should look a little out of sorts and uncomfortable at first and should appear too young for the part, but as time goes on he rises to the occasion and finds his position with more confidence. I think if the show was allowed to continue, we would have seen him grow more ""kingly"" as he grew into more of a mature man.

It's quite well done.  The sets, costumes, script and actors are all top notch.  The production quality is very high.  While the ratings weren't bad for the show, I believe it was cancelled for two reasons:  1.)  Period dramas are VERY expensive to produce.  Showtime was struggling in the last two seasons of The Tudors just to continue the series' budget.  So, I can imagine what Starz was paying for this per episode.  2.)  This good show had the misfortune of premiering in the exact same season as the MUCH inferior, Game of Thrones on HBO, which seemed to steal it's thunder.Even so, I highly recommend this series, especially if you enjoyed The Tudors.  I could tell immediately from the production values, style of the presentation and even the writing that someone from The Tudors had to be involved with this production.  In fact, they are.  Michael Hirst, who created and executive produced The Tudors does so here.  The look and feel is very much the same.  Even the casting personnel are the same.Eva Green is fantastic as Morgan Le Fey as is most everyone else.  My only two gripes are unfortunately actors in the two biggest parts.  Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur is just okay.  I realize Arthur is a reluctant boy-King, but they really needed to get someone with more GRAVITAS, especially when Arthur assumes the throne and really needs to display some balls.  The entire show revolves around him.  Someone like Jonathan Rhys Myers could carry the Tudors.  Bower can't do the same for Camelot.  Joseph Fiennes, as Merlin is strangely irritating.  For nearly the first entire season, he wears the SAME scowl on his face.  It NEVER changes.  His performance isn't okay.  It's disappointing.  I was surprised because he's a very good actor...just not in this part...in my opinion.  Who knows how he would have evolved it over the course of 3-4 seasons.  We'll never know, but in this season...Merlin has a stick up his butt the entire time making him very, very unlikable.The locations are lush.  It's shot in British Columbia, as was The Tudors.  If Feinnes had been better, I'd have given this a 5-star, and made due with Bower's lackluster Arthur.

Spartacus itself was, well, an acquired taste--it has its own distinctive look and feel which took me a while to get used to...but once I did, I really enjoyed the show.  So, I tried very hard to extend the same patience to my viewing of Camelot.  In the end, it gets a pleasant but uninspired ""hmmm"" from me.  It wasn't a bad show, but it had a lot more promise than was actually realized on the screen.It was nice visually, I'll give it that.  There were some lovely costumes and some of the scenery was simply breathtaking.  But it felt very ""updated"" for a film on this subject--hair was very modern or modern inspired, and everything was very very clean--something which was probably not the case in the court of King Arthur.  That is a small nitpick that I could easily look around, especially when the cast is as beautiful as these folks are.  They are definitely a treat for the eyes, and many of the actors did quite a good job given the lines they were fed.  Really, my beef is with the writers, for they failed me with their primary task--creating a fresh and well constructed story.Everyone knows the classic tale of Arthur.  It has become quite the fashion to retell classic tales, putting a new spin on the narrative, and I'm fine with that.  The plot was close enough on some of the generalized stuff that it was still recognizable as the Arthurian legend--but the Arthur/Merlin relationship was just hard to take (someone else has already commented on his ""crucial"" rock-climbing tutorial), Morgan was laughably underdeveloped, and by the end of the season, it felt like the narrative threads were not being handled as smoothly as they should have been.Insert a Small Guilty Swallow **here**.  I sheepishly report that I still finished the darn thing.  I don't know why.  I don't know why I couldn't stop watching...but I couldn't.  I can't justify it to myself.  I also can't believe it, but I actually want more.  But I can't recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality retelling of Arthur's legend.

Granted, I did not expect much. Yea, another cheesy period piece with Hollywood pretty boys pretending to be tough and dramatic. HOWEVER - after the first 4 episodes, I find myself eagerly awaiting the rest!They twist the popular telling of King Arthur in new and interesting ways. The production values are very high, the sets are lush, the lighting well done, and the matte painting special effects and cinematography are far above average. The location shooting in Ireland and Canada is a treat. The writing and acting are certainly decent, and the cast, while mostly filled with Hollywood pretty boys/girls is well cast and does a good job.I love the understated way Merlin is portrayed by Joseph Fiennes - until the fourth episode you still can't decide whether he has any wizardry powers at all. The Arthur character is and noble at heart, but impetuous and young. He is well played, but somehow remains the least interesting of the main characters for me. His nemesis, half-sister Morgan (Eve Green), practices witchcraft and borders on over-the-top dramatics in her attempt to capture the throne, but she reigns it in just enough to make her character fascinating and very hard to take your eyes off. (There may be some actual wizardry here - you may remember Eva as the Bond girl in Casino Royale - yet here, she looks younger and sexier than she did several years ago in that film.)For an ""action themed"" story, it runs at a slower pace than some of its rivals, but I feel this works well for them. While there is some nudity and profanity, it is mild compared to the graphic violence-porn of things like Spartacus. Camelot, so far, would be a PG-13 to Spartacus's strong-R or NC-17 - allowing Camelot to pay more attention to characters and story. It is clearly trying to appeal to the male and female demographic. Except for the occasional nude scene (not graphic, but not mild either) it could be shared with the teens as well, but they might be a bit uncomfortable if the parents are around!I'm a little concerned as to how this story will keep its momentum. About half of the classic Arthurian legend is covered in the first 4 episodes, so they're going to have to be creative to keep up the quality exhibited so far, but I'm hoping that they succeed, as I would strongly recommend Camelot based on the first 4 episodes.",4,A great surprise!,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,2616,"['Reviewing', 'TV', 'shows', 'kind', 'pointless', ""'re"", 'looking', ""'re"", 'almost', 'certainly', 'fan', 'already', 'case', 'jumped', 'here', 'link', 'similar', 'show', 'here', 'are', 'thoughts', 'new', 'viewer', 'was', 'asked', 'review', 'program', 'having', 'prior', 'experience', 'Granted', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'much', 'Yea', 'cheesy', 'period', 'piece', 'Hollywood', 'pretty', 'pretending', 'be', 'tough', 'dramatic', 'HOWEVER', 'first', '4', 'episodes', 'find', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'rest', 'twist', 'popular', 'telling', 'King', 'Arthur', 'new', 'interesting', 'ways', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'sets', 'are', 'lush', 'lighting', 'well', 'done', 'matte', 'painting', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'are', 'far', 'above', 'average', 'location', 'shooting', 'Ireland', 'Canada', 'treat', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'certainly', 'decent', 'cast', 'mostly', 'filled', 'Hollywood', 'pretty', 'boys/girls', 'well', 'cast', 'good', 'job.I', 'understated', 'way', 'Merlin', 'portrayed', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'fourth', 'episode', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'wizardry', 'powers', 'Arthur', 'character', 'noble', 'heart', 'impetuous', 'young', 'well', 'played', 'somehow', 'least', 'interesting', 'main', 'characters', 'nemesis', 'half-sister', 'Morgan', 'Eve', 'Green', 'practices', 'witchcraft', 'borders', 'over-the-top', 'dramatics', 'attempt', 'capture', 'throne', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'character', 'fascinating', 'very', 'hard', 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'may', 'be', 'actual', 'wizardry', 'here', 'may', 'remember', 'Eva', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'yet', 'here', 'younger', 'sexier', 'did', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'action', 'themed', 'story', 'slower', 'pace', 'rivals', 'feel', 'well', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'mild', 'compared', 'graphic', 'violence-porn', 'things', 'Spartacus', 'Camelot', 'so', 'far', 'would', 'be', 'PG-13', 'Spartacus', 'strong-R', 'NC-17', 'allowing', 'Camelot', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'characters', 'story', 'clearly', 'trying', 'appeal', 'male', 'female', 'demographic', 'occasional', 'nude', 'scene', 'not', 'graphic', 'not', 'mild', 'either', 'could', 'be', 'shared', 'teens', 'well', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'parents', 'are', ""'m"", 'little', 'concerned', 'how', 'story', 'will', 'keep', 'momentum', 'half', 'classic', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'covered', 'first', '4', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'be', 'creative', 'keep', 'up', 'quality', 'exhibited', 'so', 'far', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'succeed', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'Camelot', 'based', 'first', '4', 'episodes']",N/A
