Very wonderful funny comedy with a bitter sweet family history to it.  I laughed my ass off and realized how luck I am to have my family.,5,FREAKING AWESOME!!!,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,259,"['loved', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'got', 'released', 'DVD', 'saw', 'HBO', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'wanted', 'ever', 'Very', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'comedy', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'family', 'history', 'laughed', 'ass', 'realized', 'how', 'luck', 'am', 'have', 'family']",N/A

1318043,A3K23JFKNP2GNJ,B0031U8OIQ,Jae Least,"[0, 0]","I really enjoyed this DVD because it was not what you usually expect from a sand-up performance. It was a mix of that and a play...a one-man drama. I'm a huge fan of story-teling and anything of an (auto)biographical nature, so mixing that with stand-up was ideal for me. However, I do think the storyline was more interesting than the jokes were funny. With that said, if you are in this strictly for the jokes you may be disappointed depending on your humor. Also, as to be expected, there's quite a bit of Spanglish, so if you don't have a little bit of Spanish in your vocabulary, you may miss some things here and there.Bottom line: If you like autobiographical content and humor, you'll love this. Looking for a night in for some heavy laughs, skip this.

1318047,A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S,B0031U8OIQ,Thomas E. Davis,"[1, 1]","John Leguizamo is seriously underrated as an actor and writer. He's played dozens of minor film roles but never hit the big time, perhaps because his true genius resides on stage, where he creates unforgettable characters and gives fearless, full-throttle performances. His early-90s productions of ""Mambo Mouth"" and ""Spic-O-Rama"" were brilliant one-man shows that won multiple awards and were filmed for HBO, but this 1998 solo stageplay, remounted and directed in the year 2000 by none other than Spike Lee, presents Leguizamo at his most personal and expansive. One of the sharpest minds in theater today, he combines music and dance, uproarious physical humor, perfectly captured voices, and genuine affection for the many people and cultures he sends up.He takes on his dysfunctional Colombian-Puerto-Rican family and his 1970s upbringing in Queens, New York, in a grossly exaggerated memoir that forces a viewer to wonder how many of the details are genuinely autobiographical. The answer, apparently, is that many of them are invented, but this doesn't rob the play of its power and impact. Leguizamo sells his story with total commitment and jaw-dropping energy, making us believe in the outsized personalities of every member of his crazy clan: his father, a violent drunk and philandering conman; his mother, a longsuffering drama queen; his fat little brother, a perennial scapegoat; his weird, spooky grandmothers; and his gay, deaf uncle. He adds terrific characters from his neighborhood: Black, Irish, Italian, German, Korean, Chinese, and more.Most of the story is screamingly funny, particularly Leguizamo's reenactments of his parents' battles royale, his very raw descriptions of a quest to lose his virginity at the age of 16, and his portrayal of his uncle, whose successful effort to sneak him into ""A Chorus Line"" changed his life. But the story is also poignant at times, as when his father is revealed to be a dishwasher instead of the headwaiter he pretends to be, or when Leguizamo is cast in his first off-off-Broadway play, ""Junkie Christ,"" and he responds to his father's awkward congratulations by telling the old man off. I was captivated by this production, a full 90 minutes of all-consuming entertainment, and I give it my highest recommendation.",5,A very good kind of freaky,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,2281,"['John', 'Leguizamo', 'seriously', 'underrated', 'actor', 'writer', 'played', 'dozens', 'minor', 'film', 'roles', 'never', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'perhaps', 'true', 'genius', 'resides', 'stage', 'where', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'fearless', 'full-throttle', 'performances', 'early-90s', 'productions', 'Mambo', 'Mouth', 'Spic-O-Rama', 'were', 'brilliant', 'one-man', 'shows', 'won', 'multiple', 'awards', 'were', 'filmed', 'HBO', '1998', 'solo', 'stageplay', 'remounted', 'directed', 'year', '2000', 'none', 'other', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Leguizamo', 'most', 'personal', 'expansive', 'One', 'sharpest', 'minds', 'theater', 'today', 'music', 'dance', 'uproarious', 'physical', 'humor', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'voices', 'genuine', 'affection', 'many', 'people', 'cultures', 'up.He', 'dysfunctional', 'Colombian-Puerto-Rican', 'family', '1970s', 'upbringing', 'Queens', 'New', 'York', 'grossly', 'exaggerated', 'memoir', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'details', 'are', 'genuinely', 'autobiographical', 'answer', 'apparently', 'many', 'are', 'invented', ""n't"", 'rob', 'play', 'power', 'impact', 'Leguizamo', 'story', 'total', 'commitment', 'jaw-dropping', 'energy', 'making', 'believe', 'outsized', 'personalities', 'member', 'crazy', 'clan', 'father', 'violent', 'drunk', 'philandering', 'conman', 'mother', 'longsuffering', 'drama', 'queen', 'fat', 'little', 'brother', 'perennial', 'scapegoat', 'weird', 'spooky', 'grandmothers', 'gay', 'deaf', 'uncle', 'terrific', 'characters', 'neighborhood', 'Black', 'Irish', 'Italian', 'German', 'Korean', 'Chinese', 'more.Most', 'story', 'screamingly', 'funny', 'particularly', 'Leguizamo', 'reenactments', 'parents', 'battles', 'royale', 'very', 'raw', 'descriptions', 'quest', 'lose', 'virginity', 'age', '16', 'portrayal', 'uncle', 'successful', 'effort', 'sneak', 'A', 'Chorus', 'Line', 'changed', 'life', 'story', 'also', 'poignant', 'times', 'when', 'father', 'revealed', 'be', 'dishwasher', 'instead', 'headwaiter', 'be', 'when', 'Leguizamo', 'cast', 'first', 'off-off-Broadway', 'play', 'Junkie', 'Christ', 'father', 'awkward', 'congratulations', 'telling', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'captivated', 'production', 'full', '90', 'minutes', 'all-consuming', 'entertainment', 'give', 'highest', 'recommendation']",N/A
