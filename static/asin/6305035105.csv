The acting was good, if over the top, but that was the kind of acting needed in a film like this, which seemed to be a combination of ""Home Alone"" and ""Mouse Hunt"".  But the direction was very odd. The movie seemed to be set in the 1950's, yet characters in the movie used a remote for the (black and white) TV and a cellular phone. The costuming was also odd. Yes, they had to make do with what they could ""borrow"" to make clothes, but their outfits, and the really odd hairdos, made them look like creatures from another planet. Also, have the cast was British and half was American, which added to the confusion about what world the movie was set in.On the other hand, the special effects were quite good. The best part of the DVD is the sequence that shows how the special effects were done.

Overall the movie is fun and entertaining and it has been so long since I read the books that I can't be sure the weak points originate in the movie (although I believe they do).The movie is based upon a series of books by Mary Norton about a race of small people who live in the cracks and walls of the world and are known for borrowing things from humans (or beings).  The story centers around one borrower family who are the last of their kind in an old house.  Their existence is threatened when the evil Mr. Potter sees to kicking out the being inhabitants in order to knock the house down.  There then follows a series of adventures as borrowers and beings alike try to save the house from destruction.The weak points in the movie concern anachronisms.  For the most part the movie is set decades ago as in the books.  But annoying anachronisms pop up such as a cellular phone and an in-door ice maker.  Considering the vintage of the vehicles on the street these items really stand out.

He eventually finds Arrietty who is a Borrower and she explains what Borrowers do. The Lenders have to move out of their house because a mean man named Ocious Potter wants to build an apartment building in its place. The Borrowers try to go with the Lenders but the kids fall out of the truck and have to travel through the city to find the new house that is by the old church.Some of the main characters in the movie are Pete Lender, Arrietty Clock, Ocious P. Potter, and Exterminator Jeff. My favorite character is Pete Lender because he really cares about the Borrowers and is really funny. Exterminator Jeff is on Ocious P. Potter's team at first but then wants to help Pete and the Borrowers.My favorite part in the movie is when Peagreen Clock fell out of the truck and landed in dog poop. I like that part because it was really funny and I think that a lot of people would think that was funny too.  Another part I really like is when Ocious P. Potter got squirt with cheese. The Borrowers pushed the lever to squirt the cheese because he was after them. It worked and the Borrowers got away!I would recommend this movie for all ages 3 and up because there are a couple of scary parts but not too many and it is a really good movie.

In fact, it takes many liberties with the original storyline, and even the characters do not live up to the wonderful characterizations depicted in the books.Having said that, the movie will appeal to young children who have not had the books read to them nor read the books themselves. My first grader loved the movie and was captivated by the fantasy tale of a family of ""borrowers"", tiny people who live under the floor, staying alive by keeping out of humans' sight, and ""borrowing"" whatever they need from their oblivious human hosts.The story moves quickly with lots of action scenes depicting the borrowers in peril, and some scenes can be too unsettling for younger viewers like the scene where one of the young ""borrowers"" gets pushed into a machine, presumably to be squished! John Goodman is credibly wicked as the developer who wishes to turn the home where the borrowers reside into an apartment complex. His performance contrasts nicely with the benign borrowers, though I found the mix-match of British and American accents a bit distracting.On the whole, this is a cute story that will delight young viewers, ages 5-8.",3,"Fun film for young children, not a faithful adaptation of the books",1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,1320,"['film', 'adaptation', 'books', 'written', 'Mary', 'Norton', 'i.e.The', 'Complete', 'Adventures', 'Borrowerswill', 'disappoint', 'fans', 'books', 'not', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'long', 'shot', 'fact', 'many', 'liberties', 'original', 'storyline', 'even', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'wonderful', 'characterizations', 'depicted', 'books.Having', 'said', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'young', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'books', 'read', 'read', 'books', 'first', 'grader', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'captivated', 'fantasy', 'tale', 'family', 'borrowers', 'tiny', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'floor', 'staying', 'alive', 'keeping', 'humans', 'sight', 'borrowing', 'need', 'oblivious', 'human', 'hosts.The', 'story', 'moves', 'quickly', 'lots', 'action', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'borrowers', 'peril', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'unsettling', 'younger', 'viewers', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'young', 'borrowers', 'pushed', 'machine', 'presumably', 'be', 'squished', 'John', 'Goodman', 'credibly', 'wicked', 'developer', 'who', 'turn', 'home', 'where', 'borrowers', 'reside', 'apartment', 'complex', 'performance', 'contrasts', 'nicely', 'benign', 'borrowers', 'found', 'mix-match', 'British', 'American', 'accents', 'bit', 'whole', 'cute', 'story', 'will', 'delight', 'young', 'viewers', '5-8']",N/A
