And By Golly, it was the funniest show on TV. And it was Live. Not like today where everything is taped ahead and all vocals are lip synced, because none of these new so called singers of today can sing live. And the reason is...THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE CHOPS TO SING LIVE! AND THAT'S THE TRUTH. And also, I bet 99% of them don't even know what keys they sing in. I totally recommend anything to watch of these very talented people.

These shows essentially are the roots of TV variety show comedy, maybe even beyond that. The writers for these shows are like a who's who of comedy writers including the likes of Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Danny Simon, Woody Allen and the list goes on. The ability of Sid to become almost anyone in any sketch is worth the price of admission alone. And if I start to name the individual players in his cast I fear I'm sure to leave someone out, due to my faulty memory.So ... by all means buy this jewel because make no mistake it is that. Sad to say, we'll not ever see the like of this kind of great sketch comedy again. It ended with Carol and Harvey and Tim. But Sid and his pals started it all and now you can bear witness to just how great it was when you watch this collection.

Even if you eliminate the time factor here...this show was produced in the fifties..it's still holds up as a great show that's actually funny to watch the second time around.  That was the great thing about Sid Ceasar...if you notice his samurai skits were stolen from none other than John Belusi of Saturday Night Live.  If you get the chance to see any of these classics watch Sid's impression of the japanese samuri and Belusi's...this is where he got his inspiration....,5,Before Saturday Night Live there was Your Show of Shows,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,581,"['be', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'inspired', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Only', 'one', 'episodes', 'are', 'funnier', 'Even', 'eliminate', 'time', 'factor', 'here', 'show', 'was', 'produced', 'fifties..it', 'still', 'up', 'great', 'show', 'actually', 'funny', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'was', 'great', 'thing', 'Sid', 'Ceasar', 'notice', 'samurai', 'skits', 'were', 'stolen', 'none', 'other', 'John', 'Belusi', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'classics', 'watch', 'Sid', 'impression', 'japanese', 'samuri', 'Belusi', 'where', 'got', 'inspiration']",The Sid Caesar Collection - The Buried Treasures
