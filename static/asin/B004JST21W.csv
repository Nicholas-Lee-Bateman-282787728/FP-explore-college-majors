Don't worry though because its all good! This show has everything you need Action, Romance, Comedy, everything. But you should watch the first season before this one, I feel like even someone who is new to anime will especially like this as I did because it's not your typical story with your average everyday characters.

1411630,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B004JST21W,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","This review assumes that the reader has seen the first Clannad series. I have not dropped any spoilers, but if you are seriously interested in this series, then I HIGHLY recommend watching the first series:Clannad: Complete Collection [Blu-ray]Don't be disappointed when all of your favorite characters from the first Clannad series have minor roles.  We've already fleshed out their back stories.  So the writers decided to focus on some of the secondary characters from the first series, or introduced new characters for us to enjoy.  Of course Tomoya, Nagisa, and Youhei get a lot of screen time; but some of the others from the first series only have a few scenes per episode.Which is not to say that the story isn't amazing.  The episodes covering Misae's back story were the first episodes where the series really started to shine.  From there the writers were on fire, and each separate story intertwines into the main story involving Nagisa and Tomoya.  In this series I think that we really Nagisa being a little more stoic and Tomoya really shows his friendship and loyalty, much as he did in the first series.The characters all continue as they have from the first series so there aren't too many surprises with their personalities.  The animation is even better than the first series, the Blu-Ray just pops with breathtaking visuals.  The backgrounds are particularly nice.The price is steep, but you're getting 625 minutes of 25 episodes.  Comparing to some other Sentai releases such as No.6 ($69 msrp - $60 current price for 275 minutes, Blu-Ray) or some of Funimations releases such as Shangri-La ($59 MSRP - $50 current price for 300 minutes - DVD only), then the price doesn't seem too steep.  Sentai could have broken the series into two parts, charged $40 or $50 each and still had a price in line with the others.  I think it's one of the better anime series in the last few years and a great purchase.  If you buy one anime series this year, then buy Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood on Blu-Ray.  If you buy two series, then pick up Clannad After Story.",5,Think of this as Clannad - other stories ~,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,2074,"['review', 'reader', 'seen', 'first', 'Clannad', 'series', 'have', 'not', 'dropped', 'spoilers', 'are', 'seriously', 'interested', 'series', 'then', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'watching', 'first', 'series', 'Clannad', 'Complete', 'Collection', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'when', 'favorite', 'characters', 'first', 'Clannad', 'series', 'have', 'minor', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'already', 'fleshed', 'out', 'back', 'stories', 'writers', 'decided', 'focus', 'secondary', 'characters', 'first', 'series', 'introduced', 'new', 'characters', 'enjoy', 'course', 'Tomoya', 'Nagisa', 'Youhei', 'get', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'others', 'first', 'series', 'only', 'have', 'few', 'scenes', 'episode.Which', 'not', 'say', 'story', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'episodes', 'covering', 'Misae', 'back', 'story', 'were', 'first', 'where', 'series', 'really', 'started', 'shine', 'writers', 'were', 'fire', 'separate', 'story', 'intertwines', 'main', 'story', 'involving', 'Nagisa', 'Tomoya', 'series', 'think', 'really', 'Nagisa', 'being', 'little', 'more', 'stoic', 'Tomoya', 'really', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'much', 'did', 'first', 'series.The', 'characters', 'continue', 'have', 'first', 'series', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'surprises', 'personalities', 'animation', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'series', 'Blu-Ray', 'just', 'breathtaking', 'visuals', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'particularly', 'nice.The', 'price', 'steep', ""'re"", 'getting', '625', 'minutes', '25', 'episodes', 'Comparing', 'other', 'Sentai', 'releases', 'such', 'No.6', '69', 'msrp', '60', 'current', 'price', '275', 'minutes', 'Blu-Ray', 'Funimations', 'releases', 'such', 'Shangri-La', '59', 'MSRP', '50', 'current', 'price', '300', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'only', 'then', 'price', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'steep', 'Sentai', 'could', 'have', 'broken', 'series', 'two', 'parts', 'charged', '40', '50', 'still', 'had', 'price', 'line', 'others', 'think', 'one', 'better', 'anime', 'series', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'great', 'purchase', 'buy', 'one', 'anime', 'series', 'year', 'then', 'buy', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Brotherhood', 'Blu-Ray', 'buy', 'two', 'series', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'Clannad', 'Story']",N/A

1411633,A3JC0JWNWX2HHU,B004JST21W,Daniel Meek,"[1, 1]","I loved this conclusion to the Clannad story!While the first half of the story follows the comical directionless life of highschoolers trying to find meaning and direction in life, this 2nd half really kicks the drama up a notch.  In this 2nd half of the story we see the characters face the thing they never though they would face; Real life.  Juggling relationships, money, work, and sleep in order to scratch out a living and supporting those that they love.  If you have ever been out on your own, this will hit close to home and be rather cathartic, and even the hardest stone of a person would not be able to keep from shedding a tear or two while watching.  There are some bits of fictional/fantastical story telling through it, but for the most part it reflects the life of most people who get out of school and deal with the question of 'now what', and then, after life deals the most unfair of blows, how to deal with pain, loss, and carry on when everything seems lost.It's a perfect anime drama, and you would be hard pressed to find anything better, or more touching, in this genera.  I personally watched it when stuck in a job I hated and struggled with, and while my wife was pregnant and wondering 'how on earth is life going to work'.  Maybe it just hit me at the right time of life like Escaflowne did, but this will always go down as one of the most impact-full shows I have seen, and I would highly suggest it to anyone who enjoys a good anime!

1411634,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004JST21W,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","When it comes to the Japanese software company Key, many fans appreciate their work as the video games tend to be dating simulators for the PC and many other video game consoles.  Known for two visual novels ""Kanon"" and ""Air"" (both were adapted to anime series), the objects of the video games tend to be the gamer controlling the main male protagonist and with a lot of female friends, answering questions correctly in order to score.  The first two video games were adult-based but in 2004, the company released ""Clannad"", a series that would not show nudity or fan service and a game for all ages.""Clannad"" received an anime adaptation in 2007 with a total of 23-episodes  and was released on DVD earlier this year in the US from Sentai Filmworks.  The second season known ""Clannad ~After Story~"" (which takes place after the first season of Clannad and then ten years later) is now being released in the US.  The anime series is directed by Tatsuya Ishihara (""Air"", ""Kanon"", ""Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"") and a screenplay by Fumihiko Shimo (""Full Metal Panic!"", ""Air"", ""Burst Angel"", ""Gravion"", ""Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"").  The character design for the anime series is by Kazumi Ikeda (""Kanon"") and is faithful to the original designs by Itaru Hinoue (""Air"", ""Kanon"").The series was released on DVD back in 2009 by Sentai Filmworks and in July 2012, the complete series was released on Blu-ray featuring both the Japanese and English lossless soundtracks.VIDEO:""Clannad ~After Story~: Complete Collection"" is definitely an improvement over the 2009 DVD release, and that is pretty good considering the original DVD was vibrant and beautiful to begin with.So far, each anime series that were based off a Key video game such as ""Kanon"" and ""Air"" have both been fantastic anime series featuring vibrant animation, colorful backgrounds and just many settings that really make the series stand out.The same can be said about ""Clannad ~After Story~"", the animation and production is absolutely fantastic.  Kyoto Animation has done a wonderful job with the artistic backgrounds.  Also, the animation is solid and character designs are also done very well.During my viewing, I did not see any banding or artifacting issues, black levels were deep and as mentioned, the series is absolutely vibrant and colorful.AUDIO:""Clannad ~After Story~: Complete Collection"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  Back in 2009, the DVD featured only the Japanese audio soundtrack in stereo but now on Blu-ray, both English and Japanese lossless soundtracks are presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.Lossless audio is primarily dialogue and music coming from the front and center channels.  Surround channels are utilized for musical instruments and ambiance.Japanese voice acting is solid and a lot of well-known Seiyuu are involved in the series.  Both Mai Nakahara and Yuuichi Nakamura were fantastic in the series and I wasn't sure how the English dialogue would be, but sure enough, Sentai Filmworks did a fantastic job in the casting as David Matranga and Luci Christian were absolute marvelous in the English dub.  So, anime fans should feel comfort in knowing that both lossless soundtrack and the voice acting are well-done.Subtitles are featured in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Clannad ~After Story~: Complete Collection"" comes with the following special features:Clean Opening AnimationClean Ending AnimationEpisode 16 Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by English voice talents David Matranga (voice of Tomoya Okazaki) and Luci Christian (voice of Nagisa Furukawa).  Both voice talent discuss the anime series and their thoughts on their characters and the series as a whole.Trailers - Sentai Filmwork trailers.JUDGMENT CALL:After gushing about how much I enjoyed the first season of ""Clannad"", I was definitely looking forward to ""Clannad ~After Story~"".I've heard many times from fans of the series that ""Clannad ~After Story~"" is an absolutely wonderful conclusion of the series, so I definitely was looking forward to it.For the most part, the first half of the series is similar to the first season of the series in that it focuses on storylines of several key characters.  In this case, a mix of the main characters but also supporting cast with a story focusing on Youhei and his sister Mei, Youhei's landlord Misae, the library worker Yukine, the musician turned electrician Yusuke and then back to the primary characters Tomoya and Nagisa.Like the first season of ""Clannad"", the storyline for each of these characters are quite emotional.  From learning more about Youhei and his sister's relationship and his respect for Tomoya, Misae's storyline is quite interesting because she's a character that is rarely featured and if anything, her storyline is tied to the character of Tomoyo.  But for the most part, her storyline is equally emotional and somewhat tragic as it deals with her past and why she has not moved on.  Yukine's was OK and was more explaining her ties to the gang community and her trying her best to stop the fighting.  Yusuke, a character who really never factored into the first season plays an important part in Tomoya's storyline, especially post-graduation.  But his story is short and is more to show Tomoya about protecting the person you love and doing what you can for that person.But the underlying story in each of these episodes is the relationship between Tomoya and Nagisa.  How these two are truly in love with each other and no matter how frail or how sick she gets, Tomoya's love for her is strong and unconditional and it was great to see their relationship blossom even after Tomoya graduates from high school.As each of the character storylines were enjoyable (and emotional at the same time), what I found interesting are the short opening animation on each episode featuring a robot and a girl which points to dismal storyline which is quite vague at this point but you suspect that something bad may happen in the series.  Is it a dream or is there some underlying meaning for those scenes?The second half of the series is more realistic and heartbreakin.  as Tomoya and Nagisa now live their adult lives as a married a couple and eventually wanting to start a family.  We have received hints from the opening of the anime series with a girl and a robot but the storylines were vague until you reach this final half of the season.The final half of ""Clannad ~After Story~"" is fantastic and emotional.  I don't think I have cried this hard for an anime series since I have watched ""Grave of the Fireflies"", that is how depressing and emotional that ""Clannad ~After Story~"" has gotten and episode after episode, I couldn't stop, it was that captivating and suffice to say, you are pulled in as you have watched many episodes of Tomoya and Nagisa grow from their high school years and now to their married years and you have two bombshells dropped on you that is so emotionally hard to take in.Also, knowing that those emotions and what you see, mirrors reality in knowing that there are fathers who have had to deal with a similar situation that Tomoya had to go through.  The series does have a happy ending and of course, the realism of the storyline can be lost but in the context of what we experienced throughout this series, especially with the Fuko and Yukine storyline, there are magical things that happen in the world of ""Clannad"".  The balls of light that we have seen in several episodes and the discussion of alternate universes (especially with the two OVA's), the screenplay plays off possibly like its video game counterpart that this is not a an anime series based on reality, it's a series based on possibilities and anything is possible.For the realists, one can feel that with episode 21, the tragedy that unfolds is their true conclusion.  For those who want that magical, happy ending... episode 22 and the final episode summary gives you that other option.  It's interesting because typically, you don't get a choice in the matter at the end of an anime series.  Pretty much at the end of a series, what is done is done (unless there is a movie or OVA version featuring a re-imagining of the series).  Not for ""Clannad ~After Story~"", the series has always had its enjoyable happy moments and its emotional moments.  As a viewer, part of me felt that episode 21 is how things should be, to capture that realism of the storyline.  But knowing how things happened during the Fuko, Misae and Yukine storyline in ""Clannad"" and ""Clannad ~After Story~"", magical things happen in the town where Tomoya and Nagisa live which can't be explained and thus episode 22 and the summary episode is an ending that makes sense.In the end and now watching this series from beginning to end and almost like a marathon, so captivated that I couldn't stop, I realize why this acclaimed series is loved by many.  Definitely one of the best dramatic anime series I have seen in a very long time since ""Kimagure Orange Road"", ""Maison Ikkoku"" and the ""Video Girl Ai"" OVA series.  It's that magic that I have missed when it comes to romance and realistic drama series and it's great to finally watch a series that really shows you the value of life and absolutely captivates you from beginning to end.Overall, ""Clannad ~After Story~: Complete Collection"" and the whole entire ""Clannad"" series on Blu-ray receives my highest recommendation!  5 stars!",5,"Incredibly emotional, hilarious and entertaining.  A must buy anime on Blu-ray release!",1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,9414,"['When', 'Japanese', 'software', 'company', 'Key', 'many', 'fans', 'appreciate', 'work', 'video', 'games', 'tend', 'be',

1411640,A3HZ8JLMMGVVPV,B004JST21W,Jonathan A. Chang,"[1, 6]","It's sort of hard to review Clannad: After Story without mentioning the first season, so I will give a quick rundown. The series Clannad in its entirety can be broken down into 2 segments and discussed separately. There is Tomoya & Friends, and Tomoya & Nagisa. The anime is based on a visual novel game, and as I understand it the different arcs would represent entirely different paths, leading to endings in their own right, however typical of anime they had to condense all that into a single series in some way. Keep in mind, this is a review of the anime, not the game.In the first season, 14 episodes were dedicated to the Fuko and Kotomi arcs, and a couple more briefly touched upon Kyou. The format is typical in harem anime, with multiple girls vying for affection from the main character Tomoya. The difference perhaps is in the angst and absurdities of the plot line: a girl shaves wooden starfishes in an attempt to invite strangers to her sister's wedding, and a ""genius"" girl that blames herself for her parents' deaths. One must keep in mind that both these girls are supposed to be high school students, yet their actions are so bizarre that it must beg the question, ""How did they get there?"" Indeed, how does Kotomi have enough class credits despite being labeled a genius, being that she never attended school? But nevertheless, these characters are not the focal point of Clannad; rather they are homunculus: caricatures that plod along the emotional impact of the show. After their respective arcs, they will never be mentioned again in the series, except for opportune moments where they contribute merely to the mood of a scene.The last half of the first season was dedicated to Tomoya & Nagisa, who is the only female lead that really matters. And just the same, After Story will follow a similar formula, with about 8 episodes this time given to Tomoya & Friends, and the remaining 14 or so dedicated to Nagisa.Around episode 7 or so in After Story, the writer Jun Maeda will start subliminally suggesting the intended theme of this production: family. He will sneak that word into the script inappropriately, at any event that could even vaguely resemble interpersonal connections. Tomoya meets an old acquaintance; it's because of family. A neighbor helps out at the store; it's because they're practically family. The boss forgives Tomoya's mistake, or gives him a sick day; it's because they've become family. Old friends visit; because they're family. Co-worker helps out; because family. If all these vacuous scenarios qualify as representing ""family"", then what anime isn't about family? Naruto wants to save Sasuke? Family. Erika helps Harima out. Family. Sakuragi gets into a fight to help out his basketball team -- family. Yet no one in their right mind would make the connection between those scenes and family, and indeed Clannad and family as well, if it wasn't suggested to them in such a manner. The consumers of Clannad are sure a gullible bunch. So what does Tomoya & Friends have to do with Tomoya & Nagisa? They're family... Besides a couple brief scenes where they gather to give Tomoya a show of support, the majority of these characters will never have another major role. That is why I suggested in my review of the previous season to skip Tomoya & Friends entirely, since they have minimal impact on the true story, being background characters that need not be developed. I also went into detail about why I thought Tomoya & Friends is a cheap manipulative gimmick (although I admittedly could've been more succinct, and worded my previous review better), so I won't go into it again. I will say that if I could give episodes 1-8 of After Story a negative rating, I would have -- they rank amongst the worst anime I have ever watched, and I have several hundred notches under my belt.Now if we take something like episode 1-4, then 15-22 from the first season, and then episodes 9-22 of After Story, we would have what could be described as a well-rounded romance/tragedy about an obnoxious lead that helps a shy girl find her voice. But neither does this quite reach the heights of its hype. There are few moments of authenticity in the development of this relationship, but in the end this was bogged down by bad decision making and gimmicky soap-opera-like twists that exist for no reason besides giving the audience emotional turmoil. We've all seen it in Hollywood movies. Why did the housekeeper have to go looking for strange noises in the attic? Why did the couple have unprotected sex when there's a contagious disease out and about? Why did they decide to take a ""short cut"" that wasn't listed on the map? Why would they stay in that decrepit house in the middle of nowhere? Bad decisions. When Nagisa, being unhealthy as she was, decides to have at-home birth, and all the other characters rushes to her support, it foreshadows what would happen. You already know without me telling you. When Tomoya refuses to take his daughter to the hospital because he doesn't ""know what kind of tests they would run, so there's no point"", it becomes obvious what the end result of that decision would be. There's a thing about mysterious ""Space AIDS"" illnesses -- they seem to happen to people who are allergic to hospitals. In the series, there is supposed to be a new state-of-the-art hospital that opens in that town, and quite some time was spent on how the town was changing, yet the irony here is that none of our main characters have ever stepped foot inside that hospital. And it's things like this that distract any positivity this series might have had to the point that it's impossible to reconcile.Jun Maeda realized the size of the hole he dug himself a little too late, so he took his magic whiteout and reversed all the pent-up seriousness in his last 2 episodes, all without the help of dragon balls. If there's one thing about family that could be learned in Clannad, that's how many bad decisions some families make for themselves. Clannad can be seen as a parable: the morale of the story is never let a family member into your business; she might just make inedible bread and go into a fit whenever someone points it out.1/5 stars for Clannad and After Story. +1 star for episode 9-17 (was it?), which could have been a pretty decent short about an ungrateful young man that apologizes to his father after becoming a failed father

The story-line is absolutely amazing and all the characters are again extremely lovable. This series made me laugh a lot for the first dozen or so episodes which made it very enjoyable to watch, and then when the plot turns from comedy to tragedy it's really powerful and at times can make you feel like crying. The first time I watched this I teared up several times even though I'm not very easily affected by sad things. Also the little side story with the girl and robot is continued in this series as well, in case you were curious.The only complaint I have is the box that the discs come in is very annoying and every time you remove a disc you feel like you're going to break them because all four discs are placed on one holder.",5,"Absolutely love this series, hate the casing",1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,861,"['second', 'season', 'Clannad', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'series', 'filled', 'lots', 'hilarious', 'jokes', 'devastating', 'tragedies', 'story-line', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'characters', 'are', 'again', 'extremely', 'lovable', 'series', 'made', 'lot', 'first', 'dozen', 'so', 'episodes', 'made', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'then', 'when', 'plot', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'really', 'powerful', 'times', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'crying', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'teared', 'up', 'several', 'times', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'easily', 'affected', 'sad', 'things', 'Also', 'little', 'side', 'story', 'girl', 'robot', 'continued', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'case', 'were', 'curious.The', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'box', 'discs', 'come', 'very', 'annoying', 'time', 'remove', 'disc', 'feel', ""'re"", 'going', 'break', 'four', 'discs', 'are', 'placed', 'one', 'holder']",N/A

There are plenty of happy moments, and a few sad ones as well. However, After Story brings everything to a conclusion that will tear you up inside. I love this series, Clannad ties with Kanon as my favorite anime.The story focuses on Tomoya Okizaki, and his relationship with his high school sweetheart Nagisa Furukawa. It chronicles the last years of their high school life and their marriage, all the way to the birth of their daughter Ushio. There are lots of laughs as well as tears. There isn't a better anime series out there.Everything about this anime is of superb quality. The animation, voice acting, music, and story are all in a league of their own.

Don't get me me wrong I liked the first season, I enjoyed the interaction with all the different characters, all the dialog that went with it. the animation was top notch and the characters themselves were quit interesting. I also found it fascinating how there was a slight fantasy touch to the series. But that was the first season.This time around we get to see the characters who where introduced just disappear. Yes I know they show up for a seen or two, but come on, I enjoyed the interaction and now its gone. what you get is naggisa and tomoya, and a lot of drama. If you like them, which from all the reviews everyone ells apparently did, you'll love every doey eyed moment. I don't like naggi at all. shes to typical the nice girl. Ive seen that to many times pulled off better. though that is just my opinion and should be treated as such. honestly people I myself work in the field of construction. When I get home and watch anime I don't want it to be about some one struggling to pay bills, get job advancements and such. Seriously, watching a seen trying to be dramatic with Tomoya running out at night with intense music playing, giving an atmosphere of urgency because. . . . he didn't wire the thing right. . .seriously that's it. wow. I guess i live in the real world and want to watch anime that, at the very least entertain, not remind me about my job or everything ells i have to do.There focus on just the two characters did it for me, as well as chucking out the slight fantasy element that it had going for it. No I am not a troll who watches nothing but shonen. yes I like some shonen, very few as that is the most cliche genre in anime. This season just bored me to death, I mean come on I liked the first season and this one I was so disgusted I cant evan finish it.The animation was superb though, typical of such a studio.

1411646,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B004JST21W,maskedgamer,"[1, 1]","Cl'annad takes us where we last left off from the first season of the series. Toyoma and Nagisa have decided to become lovers officially. The series starts out with both of them still in school and carrying on about as the last season did, then the series takes a turn.The subject matter of the After Story takes a more serious tone. The humor that we saw in the first season is mostly absent. In this part of the anime we watch Toyoma and Nagisa mature from highschool students to adults. You watch as they experience the adult world and take on heavy obstacles placed in front of their lives. As they're experiences together mature and develop so does their relationship, and so do the problems they encounter.In Cl'annad fashion this really isn't a feel good anime, it's meant to be a drama. There aren't any laughs to be had in this season. This is true drama that After Story brings us through all 24 or so episodes. What I like about the series is that it shows through the power of an animie. How some emotions can only really be brought through and displayed through the power of animation. You really get a feel of how the characters or feeling and it brings you into the story. Everything from the art to the musical scores are done extremely well.Personally although the story was great in how it was told, I found it extremely depressing. In the series of Cl'annad in general it's one misfortune after another. It's as though no matter how hard some of the characters try they are always met with unfortunate luck.  Like they can never find peace or happiness in their world but only for a brief moment. It's as if they can never win or escape.It almost like watching a horror movie. You see the characters smiling and laughing but you know something terrible is just waiting to happen to them. Throughout watching Cl'annad I always had that feeling and I didn't care too much for it. In this series you really just want to see every do well and live out their dreams but...sometimes that just isn't how fate has it for them.Although the story of Cl'annad ""After Story"" is pretty heavy I was well prepared for the drama. After playing the visual novel ""Kana Little Sister"" even stories like Cl'annad don't effect you as much because you understand a little better about what's going on and how the characters feel(how can an animation be so real?). The drama in Cl'annad will make you become teary eyed or cry but, the drama in Kana Little Sister will leave you crying real, hard tears. Some people even get sent into a depression. The story just sticks with you for weeks, months, years. It's a life changing story about appreciate what you have no matter how little it may be. Cl'annad also gave me the save vibe which is why despite how much I hated how some of the events turned out I still liked it.After Story isn't going to hold your hand and tell you everything is going to be okay. It's a harsh and real animation. While all the other friends they met in highschool have gone out into the world to live their dreams, Toyoma and Nagisa are left behind in the same town. Toyoma is stuck there because of who life made him out to be. Nagisa is stuck there because of her condition. They may not be as fortunate as their friends in being able to find their dreams but together at least maybe they can make a new one.... or at least that's what I had hoped for.I admit I had to watch certain parts over again because the screen became cloudy...only until I realized it wasn't the screen it was me...

1411647,AQWET84VK4920,B004JST21W,McAndrews,"[0, 0]","After reading the ""Amazon.com"" review of ""Clannad: After Story""; all I can think of is that this series got way to serious and ""Adult"" for whomever the childish reviewer was that Amazon found to offer such a simplistic, naive and unappreciative viewpoint on this story.As most of you that are reading this already know, ""Clannad: After Story"" takes place a few months after ""Clannad"" ends; however, in the spirit of avoiding unknowingly spoiling anything for anyone, I will refrain from placing any major details about either series on here. This is simply my opinion to anyone that is considering watching/purchasing this series.First of all I will simply say that if you have not watched all of ""Clannad"", do yourself a favor and watch it first before watching ""Clannad: After Story"". ""Clannad"" is simply the setup to give you a majority of the background story and information to prepare you for ""Clannad: After Story"". ""Clannad"" is the light-hearted series full of comedy, good times and coming of age type story lines. ""Clannad: After Story"" is drama, and lots of it. It's the progression from a High School and childlike environment to the adult world which most people know is not all fun times, is not all play time and is also not all happy endings. To refer to ""Clannad: After Story"" as a ""Soap Opera"" cheapens it to a level not deserved.After watching ""Clannad"" I was pleased with the feeling it left me after watching the main characters come together and help each other grow in life and in friendship as they worked toward the end of their High School days. I was originally expecting the same type of ""good feeling"" progression with ""Clannad: After Story""; especially the way it begins which again was shortly after ""Clannad"" ends. Instead, what I witnessed was a work of art that brought me to cry as much as it brought me to smile and laugh. It truely was a roller coaster that kept me interested and gave me no choice but to become emotionally involved with the characters as ""real life"" set in.One of my biggest complaints about most anime (or most movies/stories in general) is the fact that they try and force you to care about the main characters and do a poor job of it by having a poorly written script with a poorly executed and choppy series of events. ""Clannad: After Story"" does a wonderful job of progressing and ending the series without that ""forced to end too soon"" or ""everything rushed to end and jammed in at the last second"" routine. It's been a long time before this series since I've finished an anime series and not had more questions than answers; leaving me with an unfulfilled feeling. Usually one of those questions being ""Why did they waste my time with this"" or ""Why is this another tale of two animes with the first half being great and the second just failing on so many levels (i.e. Chaos;HEAd)"".It's rare to come across an anime series such as this where it is truly quality from start to finish. Everyone will have their own opinions about some of the extra episodes that spin off after the series is complete but I just enjoyed them as something else to watch and look forward to before all the episodes ran out. The packaging with all 4 DVDs shoved on top of each other in a cheap case is practically sacrilegious. I cannot wait for this series to be released on Blu ray. The cheap packaging is why I have this ""product"" 4 out of 5 starts and not the full five.",4,Quality story and a work of art.,1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,3413,"['reading', 'Amazon.com', 'review', 'Clannad', 'Story', 'can', 'think', 'series', 'got', 'way', 'serious', 'Adult', 'whomever', 'childish', 'reviewer', 'was', 'Amazon', 'found', 'offer', 'such', 'simplistic', 'naive', 'unappreciative', 'viewpoint', 'story.As', 'most', 'are', 'reading', 'already', 'know', 'Clannad', 'Story', 'place', 'few', 'months', 'Clannad', 'however', 'spirit', 'avoiding', 'unknowingly', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'anyone', 'will', 'refrain', 'placing', 'major', 'details', 'series', 'here', 'simply', 'opinion', 'anyone', 'considering', 'watching/purchasing', 'series.First', 'will', 'simply', 'say', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'Clannad', 'do', 'favor', 'watch', 'first', 'watching', 'Clannad', 'Story', 'Clannad', 'simply', 'setup', 'give', 'majority', 'background', 'story', 'information', 'prepare', 'Clannad', 'Story', 'Clannad', 'light-hearted', 'series', 'full', 'comedy', 'good', 'times', 'coming', 'age', 'type', 'story', 'lines', 'Clannad', 'Story', 'drama', 'lots', 'progression', 'High', 'School', 'childlike', 'environment', 'adult', 'world', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'not', 'fun', 'times', 'not', 'play', 'time', 'also', 'not', 'happy', 'endings', 'refer', 'Clannad', 'Story', 'Soap', 'Opera', 'level', 'not', 'deserved.After', 'watching', 'Clannad', 'was', 'pleased', 'feeling', 'left', 'watching', 'main', 'characters', 'come', 'together', 'help', 'other', 'grow', 'life', 'friendship', 'worked', 'end', 'High', 'School', 'days', 'was', 'originally', 'expecting', 'same', 'type', 'good', 'feeling', 'progression', 'Clannad', 'Story', 'especially', 'way', 'again', 'was', 'shortly', 'Clannad', 'Instead', 'what', 'witnessed', 'was', 'work', 'art', 'brought', 'cry', 'as', 'much', 'brought', 'smile', 'truely', 'was', 'roller', 'coaster', 'kept', 'interested', 'gave', 'choice', 'become', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'characters', 'real', 'life', 'set', 'in.One', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'most', 'anime', 'most', 'movies/stories', 'general', 'fact', 'try', 'force', 'care', 'main', 'characters', 'do', 'poor', 'job', 'having', 'poorly', 'written', 'script', 'poorly', 'executed', 'choppy', 'series', 'events', 'Clannad', 'Story', 'wonderful', 'job', 'progressing', 'ending', 'series', 'forced', 'end', 'too', 'soon', 'everything', 'rushed', 'end', 'jammed', 'last', 'second', 'routine', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'series', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'anime', 'series', 'not', 'had', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'leaving', 'unfulfilled', 'feeling', 'Usually', 'one', 'questions', 'being', 'Why', 'did', 'waste', 'time', 'Why', 'tale', 'two', 'animes', 'first', 'half', 'being', 'great', 'second', 'just', 'failing', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'i.e', 'Chaos', 'HEAd', '.It', 'rare', 'come', 'anime', 'series', 'such', 'where', 'truly', 'quality', 'start', 'finish', 'Everyone', 'will', 'have', 'own', 'opinions', 'extra', 'episodes', 'spin', 'off', 'series', 'complete', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'something', 'else', 'watch', 'look', 'forward', 'episodes', 'ran', 'out', 'packaging', '4', 'DVDs', 'shoved', 'top', 'other', 'cheap', 'case', 'practically', 'sacrilegious', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'series', 'be', 'released', 'Blu', 'ray', 'cheap', 'packaging', 'why', 'have', 'product', '4', '5', 'starts', 'not', 'full', 'five']",N/A
1411648,A3TZSS69WBE0KB,B004JST21W,Msanimefreak,"[1, 2]","This anime is in my top 5. If you like comedy/tragedy/love stories, then look no further.Clannad: After Story is the second season to Clannad. If you haven't seen Clannad, you can still watch this collection and not be totally lost because in the first few episodes, the main male character talks about what happened previously. And the story is pretty straight forward so you can easily catch up.*****SPOILERS***** So in Clannad, we meet Nagisa and Tomoyo, the two main characters the story revolves around. In Clannad, we watch for 26 episodes, the two meet, become friends and fall for each other. Both are super shy so it takes a while for them to admit to one another how they really feel. Plus, there are alot of other babes competing for Tomoyo's attention, but Nagisa wins in the end. Clannad: After Story picks up directly after Clannad. I think like a month has passed, not even. They are now boyfriend and girlfriend and pretty much we watch as their relationship becomes stronger and they go through challenges like every other couple. They end up getting married, moving in together and starting a family. Unfortunately, due to Nagisa's occurring health problems,during the birth of their child, she dies. Now we watch as Tomoyo struggles to be a father and deals with the loss of his true love.So that is the basic story line.I gave Clannad: After Story 5 stars because:1. The Animation is gorgeous, no sloppy or messed up episodes.2. The story is amazing. If you do not cry at all, I would like to meet you and shake your hand because this anime def. pulls at the heart strings.3. Love the voice actors. I don't know their names off the top of my head, but loved every voice!4. And finally, the ending is perfection.

I have never been so blown away from an anime, as I had when I finished this wonderful story. The story starts off with Tomoya being a slacker student that meets Nagisa one day and decides to help her in building a Drama club after the last one shut down. The story that unfolds is an emotional roller coaster that everyone should ride.The animation is beautifully drawn, and looks great on a HDTV. While the characters have Anime-ish eyes, you don't really notice them when you are watching the series. The whole world, buildings, and even trees look amazing and you just get drawn in and feel like you are actually there.The music is amazing, and the Dango Daikazoku song is now burned into my head and has a special place in my heart. It makes a great anime amazing, and just gives you an experience that the Manga counterpart can never deliver on. Even the opening and ending themes (ones besides Dango) are nice to listen to on both seasons.I absolutely loved the story, and the characters are awesome and hilarious. The first season is basically the Drama club arc and the characters finishing high school. You end up just loving the characters and becoming really attached to them along the way, and you just want to know more about their lives after high school in After Story. Both seasons have a total of 47 episodes, but it goes by so fast and makes you wish you could see more of it.If you like Anime at all, you NEED to watch this series. If you like a good story, and love character development, you NEED to watch this. If you liked being entertained at all, you NEED to watch this. Yes I really mean you NEED to see this. No anime/tv show/manga/game/movie has actually made tear up, and this anime caused this to happen more than once. It made me think about what is important in life, and how it just makes you want to do good in your life.I am a 21 year old male, and I have no problem saying that I absolutely loved this anime and it will forever be the best thing I have ever watched.~ Written: January, 2012Positives:* Amazing characters* Awesome animation* Music that makes you even more attached to the story* Made me think about so many things* Will have you still thinking about this Anime a long time after seeing itNegatives:* Not for the timid hearted, as it makes you depressed at times",5,Will forever be the best thing I have ever watched,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,2464,"['Clannad', 'Series', 'ReviewI', 'had', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'anime', 'while', 'now', 'decided', 'watch', 'Netflix', 'had', 'streaming', 'list', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'blown', 'away', 'anime', 'had', 'when', 'finished', 'wonderful', 'story', 'story', 'Tomoya', 'being', 'slacker', 'student', 'Nagisa', 'one', 'day', 'help', 'building', 'Drama', 'club', 'last', 'one', 'shut', 'down', 'story', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'everyone', 'should', 'ride.The', 'animation', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'great', 'HDTV', 'characters', 'have', 'Anime-ish', 'eyes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'when', 'are', 'watching', 'series', 'whole', 'world', 'buildings', 'even', 'trees', 'look', 'amazing', 'just', 'get', 'drawn', 'feel', 'are', 'actually', 'there.The', 'music', 'amazing', 'Dango', 'Daikazoku', 'song', 'now', 'burned', 'head', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'great', 'anime', 'amazing', 'just', 'experience', 'Manga', 'counterpart', 'can', 'never', 'deliver', 'Even', 'opening', 'ending', 'themes', 'ones', 'Dango', 'are', 'nice', 'listen', 'seasons.I', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'awesome', 'hilarious', 'first', 'season', 'basically', 'Drama', 'club', 'arc', 'characters', 'finishing', 'high', 'school', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'loving', 'characters', 'becoming', 'really', 'attached', 'way', 'just', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'lives', 'high', 'school', 'Story', 'seasons', 'have', 'total', '47', 'episodes', 'fast', 'wish', 'could', 'see', 'more', 'it.If', 'Anime', 'NEED', 'watch', 'series', 'like', 'good', 'story', 'love', 'character', 'development', 'NEED', 'watch', 'liked', 'being', 'entertained', 'NEED', 'watch', 'Yes', 'really', 'mean', 'NEED', 'see', 'anime/tv', 'show/manga/game/movie', 'actually', 'made', 'tear', 'up', 'anime', 'caused', 'happen', 'more', 'once', 'made', 'think', 'what', 'important', 'life', 'how', 'just', 'want', 'do', 'good', 'life.I', 'am', '21', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'have', 'problem', 'saying', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'anime', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'watched.~', 'Written', 'January', '2012Positives', '*', 'Amazing', 'characters*', 'Awesome', 'animation*', 'Music', 'even', 'more', 'attached', 'story*', 'Made', 'think', 'so', 'many', 'things*', 'Will', 'have', 'still', 'thinking', 'Anime', 'long', 'time', 'seeing', 'itNegatives', '*', 'Not', 'timid', 'hearted', 'depressed', 'times']",N/A

1411654,A94NOJCJCI6PB,B004JST21W,Sean,"[4, 4]","Clannad After Story is a direct continuation of the story of it's predecessor. What could have been a half-assed cash in on the original actually turns out to be one of the best second seasons of an anime I've ever seen. While it does have points that it loses momentum and feels kind of like filler, it tells three very distinct, yet connected stories that really seems to work to it's emotional advantage. It divides itself between high school dating, marriage, and adulthood. It really shows a progression that gives it the emotional charm that truly makes the show so successful.The following review is rife with spoilers, especially the story section. Anyone planning to watch it, but not wishing to have the whole show ruined by me, please skip the story section. I'll try to keep any spoilers in the other sections to a bare minimum, but this is a warning from me to you. I don't need angry people with pitchforks and torches standing outside of my door in the morning. So you have been warned.The original Clannad focused on not only the romantic plot that seemed to be kind of a side story among many side stories, but also many other characters backgrounds and stories. Clannad After Story does focus on the romance a lot more, and it does come across as well done. The first part of the series focuses on school life as Tomoya finishes high school and Nagisa gets sick and has to go through the grade again. During this time we see a deep emotional connection between the characters, but we also get some baffling seemingly filler episodes concerning the dorm master lady who is not even a character that anyone really cares about at that point. After her side story, we get another half episode of side story about a rocker who I guess is the Kurt Cobain of Japan or something. I really didn't care, I wanted more of the romantic plot and the characters I cared about.So the first part of the series is more of what we have come to expect, except Tomoya and Nagisa are dating. The second part is marriage. This comes not as a surprise to anyone of course, but it is a truly heartfelt part where character emotions come into play and we start to get a deep sense of love for these characters, more so than before. As the plot continues, with the birth of Ushio and the death of Nagisa we are plunged into the sudden depths of total despair with Tomoya. This is the part that really made me laugh and cry right along with him. It was heartfelt, it was intense, it was deeply human. Sure it had it's comedy moments, but it gave you a sense of drama that is unparalleled by most anime.The end truly baffled me though, and I'm not going to detract any points because of it, but it just seemed kind of nuts. Nagisa lives, Ushio lives, and everyone lives happily ever after in some sort of weird-ass alternate dimension, symbolic thing. Maybe I'm too stupid to understand, which I have said for quite a few anime with truly weird endings. I mean, I see what it was trying to do, but the ending seemed kind of out there. It did give me a good feeling, it made me happy, it ended with everything tied up. But the way it ended well just wasn't what I was expecting.The animation is just as good as it was for Clannad. It's nothing superb or amazing or breathtaking, but it is good. Characters eyes still come across as strange to me. I don't know why because anime characters have huge eyes most of the time. That's a given. Yet for some reason, maybe the size of their eyes or something, the girls on this show have eyes that are odd. They don't detract from anything and actually bring across emotion very well. I digress though.Part of the drama of the show comes across so well thanks to the amazing voice work. Tomoya's voice actor in particular plays his role to a T and never fails to impress. Emotions are injected into every scene by the voice work. The music doesn't fail either. It has some good music, both the opening and ending are good. Music during the show is essentially the same as Clannad so don't expect much else. There is a strange song sung in English that makes less sense than a drunk Sylvester Stallone's recital of Hamlet.I can't tell you how great the characters of the series are. I just can't. They are beyond words. The original series I commended for the characters but this second series I commend even further. Character development is so well done in this series and you can see so many changes in every character from beginning to end. This plays into why the emotional scenes work, the characters are so lifelike, so relatable. It makes the show even more fun to watch when you can find characters that you can invest yourself in. Tomoya was especially a great character for me. The tough guy persona but deep inside he's a friendly, loving, caring person. Nagisa is also a great character. Her development is just as good as Tomoya's. As Tomoya makes revelations, as the pasts of characters are revealed, it's amazing how human they seem. I mean, these essentially cartoon characters act even more realistic than the real humans on television. This is the reason the drama works so well and pulls at your heartstrings as much as it does.To make a long story short, there are no bad characters. There are no unlikeable characters.Clannad After Story is an excellent addition to the series and actually exceeds the original in many aspects. When you get further through the series, maybe halfway through, you see a completely different Clannad that turns out to be even more deeply moving, charming, and likeable than the original. Ask me what I would give this anime halfway through and I would probably answer a 7. It didn't add a lot to the overall formula. But it changes. The series taken as a whole is phenomenal as far as romance/drama's go. This particular season is a huge part of that. It's a great ending to the series.It's the best drama anime I've ever seen. But once again, Toradora holds a special place in my heart as far as romance anime go.This is a 9.5/10.",5,Keye's Best Offering,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,6014,"['Clannad', 'Story', 'direct',
