Although too young to remember some of them, I was old enough to remember Hazel. The show revolves around the adventures of this extraordinary Housekeeper/Maid and her uncanny ability to always make things turn out right. The family consists of ""Mr. B"" the attorney and head of the family, although if truth be known, I always felt Hazel was the one in charge. Missy, George's wife, has known Hazel since she was a child and is the perfect complement to her husband. An interior decorator with excellent taste, she and Hazel have a very loving relationship and Missy can be counted on to run interference when Hazel and Mr. B butt heads. Then there is the adorable Harold, better known as ""Sport,"" who is such a sweet little boy who worships Hazel and considers her a hero. The acting is superb and the storylines are anything but sappy. This series proves that wholesome programs have a place in society and with it, there is always a valuable lesson to be learned. Kudos to Shirley Booth, Don DeFore, Whitney Blake and Bobby Buntrock for delivering a beautiful and entertaining story to the viewers in every episode.

These episodes only underscore how crass, selfish and automated society has become in 45 years.Shirley Booth is absolutely loveable in the role. Every line reading and reaction is perfect, whether she's chuckling while telling an exasperated Mr. B her latest joke, or trying to mask her disappointment and hurt when she's insensitively left out of a dear cousin's wedding. Not even Bobby Buntrock's over-enthusiastic line readings can spoil the show.Fans have waited over half a decade for this show to continue on DVD. Shout Factory has done a wonderful job once again. **NOTE** See the screen grabs I posted in the Images section of this product. I don't get Antenna TV (which has been running the show lately) but the episodes look much brighter and colorful than I remember seeing them on Family Channel and WWOR back in the 1990s, although they are not remastered and there are blemishes and lines here and there on the prints. There are no abrupt endings on the opening and closing credits like there was in syndication and the original Screen Gems logo is present. The insert lists the episode titles, descriptions and original airdates.Let's all support this release so Seasons 3-5 come out as quickly as ""Dennis the Menace"" did (all four seasons in under a year). **UPDATE** Season 3 will be released May 15, 2012.A BIG thank-you to Shout! for finally making it happen.

This is a excellent example of quality family entertainment.It is a credit to the acting ability of Shirley Booth that she could be so pushy and forceful yet lovable and never annoying at the same time (except to Mr. B, of course...and even he loved Hazel).  Shirley Booth was a fine actress.Interest to notice...one person said no laugh track.  I've only watched the first disc so far and only 1 episode has a laugh track.  The laughs come in at odd times on odd lines.  The mailman is feared to be depressed, is missing and may be considering suicide (that sounds worse than it is but still accurate), anyway...there are laughs in the oddest places in the dialogue.  Kinda like (can't remember exactly) ""I hope he isn't going to do something bad"" then you get HA! HA! HA! HA! laughs in the backgroudn.  Very odd.  Anyway...I prefer NO laugh track.  I'll laugh if I think it's funny...I don't need a laugh track to tell me what is and isn't funny.Finally, notice that a lot of the background is in grays and whites.  For color episodes there isn't much color in the sets or costumes.  It makes me wonder if there was a transition period from B&W; to color episodes where the sets and costumes were more grayscale for B&W; television sets and more colorful sets and costumes didn't come in until later.
