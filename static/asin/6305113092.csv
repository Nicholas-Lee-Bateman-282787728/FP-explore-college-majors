449119,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,6305113092,absent_minded_prof,"[10, 11]","I just put down a few of my thoughts about &quot;Say Anything,&quot; another John Cusack classic, and I thought I'd say my piece about this one as well...  First of all, as Austin Powers may have said once or twice in his life, my overall reaction to this film could perhaps most concisely be expressed via the simple phrase, &quot;yeah baby.&quot;  This movie is fun, funny, romantic as all get out, very intelligent, and packed with lines you will never forget.  John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga's characters are the ultimate odd couple.  I once (seriously) used their two characters in an academic setting, as examples to illustrate the opposing sides of various parts of the Myers-Briggs Personality Inventory.  He is freewheeling, she is straitlaced.  He lives his life by making things up as he goes along, she plans everything out in excruciating detail.  It's like watching a photographic negative of &quot;Dharma and Greg.&quot;  They learn from each other over the course of the movie, and both end up doing some real maturing, as well as reaching more of a happy medium,  personality-wise...For the record, watch for the scene (early in the film) where John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga are up on the roof of a building, looking at the stars.  The constellations they are talking about are real -- find a &quot;Peterson's Guide to the Night Sky&quot; and look up Perseus, Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Draco, and Cepheus.  They're really up there, they are very easy to find in the northern hemisphere, and it's one of the coolest group of mythologically interconnected constellations in the heavens.Anyway, this movie is fantastic.  It's so worth it.  Please see it, if you want to have fun, and also if anyone has ever, at any point in your life, told you you need to do some growing up.

449120,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,6305113092,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[1, 1]","This movie from 1985 already seems like a time capsule from a distant era. No cellphones, no iPods -- the characters use artifcacts like ""Filofaxes"" -- and the teens who make up most of the cast seem oddly naive and sweet compared to their counterparts today. But in its sentiments, the movie hasn't aged that much.The absurdly young John Cusack plays Gib, a faily typical young male who finds himself as a freshman on an east Coast campus struggling to keep up with some of his peers. He's creative -- but lacks basic grammar and spelling. He tries to latch on to brainy, culturally sophisticated Allison (Daphne Zuniga), a preppy, overscheduled uptight type. But Cusack's clumsy approaches earn only her scorn.The two are thrust together on a cross-country Christmas vacation trip when Gib is lured to California with the promise of a ""sure thing"" -- a beautiful woman waiting only to have brainless, guilt-free sex with him. Allison is going to visit her boyfriend -- an absurd type even more uptight than she is. They find themselves sharing a ride with a young couple with a penchant for show tunes  - until they are kicked out on the open road and forced to hitchhike.Naturally Gib and Allison fall in love during the trip during which they endure various amusing adventures.Within its genre, this ranks as a pretty decent romantic comedy.  It launched Cusack's career and there are amusing riffs also by Anthony Edwards who went to to star in ""ER"" and a young Tim Robbins giving a very funny cameo. Whatever happened to Zuniga anyway? She seems to have made her subsequent career mostly in soaps.

449122,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,6305113092,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[1, 1]","How this movie slipped past me until almost 2000 I'll never know. My passion for going to movies has always been sporadic, with large gaps of time with either fanatacism or apathy towards  what type of movies were being put out. 1985 was when my interest was rekindled with boat loads of movies addressing my age group  I must have just missed this one. I'm a huge fan of John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga, the latter of who ranks way atop my all time fave females list. Having seen most of Zuniga's relatively low output of work (I refused to lower myself to watching ""Melrose Place"" just to catch a glimpse of her), being told about this movie caught me way off guard, since this is both her and Cusack at their earliest. This was the first movie they both had significant dialogue and camera time and they both make the most of it. In an era where most teen/post teen flicks were covered by the likes of John Hughes, director Rob Reiner in only his second film hits a home run. Hughes movies are awesome. They are time capsule candidates for many reasons. But ""The Sure Thing"" connects in a totally different way with its similarly aged cast and settings, giving us a movie that highlights a slew of mixed feelings by Cusack's and Zuniga's characters, some spoken, many unspoken until push comes to shove. I don't know what it is about Zuniga, but she's always had a strong appeal to me. Maybe it's because she comes across as the unpretentious type that every guy likes. In ""Sure Thing"" she wavers between that personna and the ""in love with being in love"" dedicated to her studies and her future husband who schools on the opposite west coast where Zuniga and Cusack's cross country Christmas time journey is taking them. What starts off as a case of two complete opposites that drive each other crazy turns into an epiphany of feelings for each other despite their differences. By the movies end, it's safe to say that each has adopted a little of what makes the other person tick. Zuniga learns to loosen up a bit, while Cusack learns not to be too shallow. Reiner touches on genuine feelings and concerns of the college age characters, and from beginning to end paints a background of college experiences that anyone who's gone through it can totally relate to. He may get a little hokey or over-the-top in some scenes, in painting the straight laced extent of Zuniga's character for example. But his use of the surrounding character actors only helps soliidify the story in the foreground. ""Sure Thing"" Nicolette Sheridan, as the reason for Cusack's quest west, peaked in the gorgeous category with this movie. She's an abolute doll, a mere shadow of her ""Desperate Housewives"" character of the future. Viveca Lindfors, Tim Robbins and Anthony Edwards (during his ""Nerd"" years) all give major contributions with minimal screen time. Lindfors English Class Professor character and classroom setting put you in an authentic college atmosphere in bookend scenes that remind you by the movies' end that these are two young adults that are still evolving in school and in life. The closing scene is at the top of my all time romantic moments in the movies. A movie that's easy to watch repeatedly.",5,One of my favorite movies.

It pretty much nails the issue of going after a girl for her body or a girl for her mind -- and in the end winds up being a superior entry into the teen romance genre, which is filled with cardboard characters, stilted situations and relationships, lies and ersatz ""quirkiness"".  And the situational comedy is well handled if not quite up to the level of John Hughes.Without a doubt what really makes the movie work are the performances from the two leads. This was John Cusack's best '80s film and he is genuinely charming and funny throughout -- even when having to deliver some pretty cheesy lines. Daphne Zuniga is even better in her role as the uptight, conflicted girl who is on the wrong path in life. She is a bundle of contradictions and her character arc is played perfectly.

Though this is a movie of firsts for its soon-to-be-famous cast, the story is not particulary original nor inventive.  In fact, it is downright predictable.

Yet the beauty of this film is the sweet, funny, romantic, and old-fashioned ride that it takes in order to bring you to that oh-so-predictable ending.This is a film that has exquisitely stood the test of time.

Modern romantic comedy hits such as ""She's All That"", ""Down to You"", ""10 Things I Hate About You"", ""Head Over Heels"", and ""Never Been Kissed"" provide excellent juxtaposition to the near genre-perfection of this film.Alison: What are you doing?Gib: I'm going to bed.Alison: Not with me you're not.Gib: I'm not going to bed with you, I'm going to bed in a bed you happen to be in also.",4,"""A sure thing comes once in a lifetime...",1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,1340,"['real', 'thing', 'forever', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'classic', '1985', 'teen', 'comedy', 'Sure', 'Thing', 'one', 'John', 'Cusack', 'first', 'starring', 'roles', 'Gib', 'Gibson', 'early', 'performance', 'very', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Daphne', 'Zuniga', 'Alison', 'Bradbury', 'bizarre', 'appearance', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'firsts', 'soon-to-be-famous', 'cast', 'story', 'not', 'particulary', 'original', 'inventive', 'fact', 'downright', 'predictable', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'will', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'beauty', 'film', 'sweet', 'funny', 'romantic', 'old-fashioned', 'ride', 'order', 'bring', 'oh-so-predictable', 'ending.This', 'film', 'exquisitely', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'matter', 'fact', 'hold', 'majority', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'churned', 'out', 'Hollywood', '90', 'onwards', 'one', 'will', 'find', 'truly', 'charming', 'film', 'Modern', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'hits', 'such', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'Head', 'Heels', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', 'provide', 'excellent', 'juxtaposition', 'near', 'genre-perfection', 'film.Alison', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'Gib', ""'m"", 'going', 'bed.Alison', 'Not', ""'re"", 'not.Gib', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'bed', ""'m"", 'going', 'bed', 'bed', 'happen', 'be', 'also']",N/A

The film has the classic teenage plot of boy meets girl, girl at first hates boy and then in the end they end up together.  But instead of being just another clich&eacute;, The Sure Thing features such likable and winning performances by the two leads, John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga, that it becomes a memorable and lovable film.  Mr. Cusack stars as Walter ""Gib"" Gibson who is in a slump when it comes to getting girls.  Everyone around him at his New England campus seems to be scoring, except him.  He meets a pretty girl, Alison (Ms. Zuniga) in his English class and tries to hook up with her.  Alison is a straitlaced girl, who schedules everything she does to the second, while Gib is a spontaneous guy who lives life minute to minute.  Alison agrees to tutor Gib in English and he tries to seduce her, but he fails miserably and she ends up hating him.  His best friend from high school, Lance (Anthony Edwards) is out at college in California where he has set up a date for Gib who is a ""sure thing"".  All Gib has to do is get to California by 12/22 and he's in.  The problem is he has no money to fly, so he finds a ride with a couple who are driving out to Los Angeles.  As fate would have it, Alison is also in the car as she is heading out to see her boyfriend in LA.  The couple Gary Cooper and Mary Ann Webster are upbeat squares who sing showtunes on the trip.  Gary is played by a young Tim Robbins in one of his first roles.  Gib and Alison are constantly bickering at one another and eventually they are thrown out of the car and forced to hitch.  Along the way, Alison starts to see the real charm in Gib and starts to fall for him.  Eventually they reach LA and go their separate ways.  They both end up at the party where Gib meets his sure thing (Nicolette Sheridan).  Jealousy ensues between the two and Gib eventually takes his sure thing up to Lance's bedroom.

This movie shows the changing every human being should undergo in Life to truly become a Human Being in its broader sense. To love is to care not only about the one we love - this is too egotistic.

449155,A16QODENBJVUI1,6305113092,Robert Moore,"[12, 12]","THE SURE THING was a great film when it came out, and unlike many romantic comedies of the eighties, this one has held up marvelously.  The story is incredibly simple and one of the oldest in Hollywood:  a road picture.  Traditionally, road pictures use traveling as a metaphor for growth and development, whether growth for good or for ill.  Luckily in this picture, it is for good.  Both John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga's characters grow and develop during the course of the film, breaking through their own superficial beliefs about what they want in love and their perceptions about the other.  It is important to realize that this really isn't a teenage sex comedy.  A lot of teen films slap on some stuff about true love, but in fact attempt to titillate through the heart of the film.  There are titillation scenes in THE SURE THING featuring Nicolette Sheridan, but these are almost parodies of themselves.  In fact, the fantasies are more projections of Cusack's illusions about love.This was the movie that introduced both John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga as leading performers.  John has gone on to bigger and better things, while Daphne's career has been a bit of a disappointment to me.  I adored her in this movie, and would have liked to see her in more comedies.  But the two of them made a magnificent couple in this film, and they did a perfect job of embodying their characters.  She is perfect as the overorganized, completely A.R. stuffed skirt, while he is the epitome of the mildly nerdy guy who isn't exactly a ladykiller.  In fact, part of the key to Cusack's success is that he is sort of an Everyman:  he isn't at all unattractive, but he isn't Tom Cruise.  He doesn't make women swoon.  But he possesses vulnerability, some charm, and intelligence.This movie still charms and delights pretty much as it did when it first came out.  The music has dated a bit, and some of the hairstyles of the women are a bit painful to behold (though not Daphne's), but in most ways it continues to feel refreshingly current.

However, once you see it, you cannot deny the magic and simplicity of this great little gem.  It relates to us so honestly, innocently, and completely with its characters, that virtually everyone can find some element that speaks to them.I think most people, at some time or another, have found themselves attracted to someone that they have virtually nothing in common with.  The irony, is that we generally don't even wonder why.  We just feel the way we do.  The movie follows this idea.  It never asks why someone is attracted to someone with whom they have little or nothing in common.Walter ""Gib"" Gibson is in his freshman year of college in New England.  He's miserable.  As he states, ""I've never seen so much corduroy in one place.""  He feels that New England girls are too stuffy and intellectual.  Gib is actually intellectual himself, but you won't find him ""wasting his time"" with his nose in his textbooks either.  His best friend, Lance (and high school best friend) is at a college in sunny California.  He sends Gib a picture of a beautiful blond woman and says, ""this is the ugliest girl here.""Lance invites Gib out to California for a ""sure thing;"" a guaranteed night of passion with a gorgeous woman played by Nicolette Sheridan.  There's a catch here in the story.  Gib has unwittingly found himself attracted to the class ""brain"" of his English class, Alison.  She's certainly not the type of girl that Gib has envisioned for himself, but nonetheless, he's attracted to her.  Alison could care less about someone who lives their life as carefree as Gib does.  Alison can't do anything without consulting her schedule book.  She's an organizational freak who is incapable of doing anything spontaneous.  When Gib feels that he'll never get anywhere with her, he takes Lance up on his offer.When Gib finds a ride across country, he doesn't realize that Alison has also signed up for a ride in the same car, as she is on her way to visit her boyfriend in California.The film really takes off from here, as these two unlikely people begin to find something appealing about the other.  Alison finds herself becoming a bit more loose, and Gib finds himself becoming a bit more responsible.  But, what will happen when Gib gets to California for his ""sure thing.""  After all, the bathing beauty is the type of girl that Gib wants, right?For those who have not seen the film, I won't say any more about this.  The beauty of this film is in the journey, not the end.  The best movie I've ever seen about two people getting to know each other is ""Before Sunrise.""  ""The Sure Thing"" is right up there for me as well.  It's realistic, and it's easy to believe what is happening between these two characters who appear to be at opposite poles with each other.Rob Reiner does a magnificent job as the director of this film.  It's as if he has the pulse of both of these characters, and makes sure that nothing is forced to produce the ending that he envisions.  In this way, he's created a realistic and yet simplistic film for anyone who has ever fallen in love with someone who is completely opposite, and how two people in this situation can really learn about themselves through someone else.This is one of my two favorite roles played by John Cusack.  He simply has Gib down cold.  ""Say Anything"" is my other favorite.  Cusack seems able to play Gib without any effort.  He knows him inside and out.  And he makes Gib a very likeable person, despite his ""flaws.""Daphne Zuniga is equally good as the uptight Alison.  She wears sweaters, and keeps herself looking ultra-conservative.  Daphne is a beautiful girl, but she isn't over-the-top gorgeous, and that's important for this movie because the physical attraction is NOT what motivates these two characters.I watch this movie whenever I feel like a light-hearted comedy that tickles my funny bone as well as warms my heart.",5,"The ""Sure Thing"" is a Sure Bet",1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,4019,"['heels', 'hits', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'Sure', 'Thing', 'may', 'have', 'escaped', 'notice', 'viewers', 'However', 'once', 'see', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'magic', 'simplicity', 'great', 'little', 'gem', 'so', 'honestly', 'innocently', 'completely', 'characters', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'can', 'find', 'element', 'them.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'time', 'have', 'found', 'attracted', 'someone', 'have', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'common', 'irony', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'wonder', 'why', 'just', 'feel', 'way', 'do', 'movie', 'idea', 'never', 'why', 'someone', 'attracted', 'someone', 'whom', 'have', 'little', 'nothing', 'common.Walter', 'Gib', 'Gibson', 'freshman', 'year', 'college', 'New', 'England', 'miserable', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'corduroy', 'one', 'place', 'New', 'England', 'girls', 'are', 'too', 'stuffy', 'intellectual', 'Gib', 'actually', 'intellectual', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'wasting', 'time', 'nose', 'textbooks', 'best', 'friend', 'Lance', 'high', 'school', 'best', 'friend', 'college', 'sunny', 'California', 'Gib', 'picture', 'beautiful', 'blond', 'woman', 'ugliest', 'girl', 'here', 'Lance', 'Gib', 'California', 'sure', 'thing', 'guaranteed', 'night', 'passion', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'played', 'Nicolette', 'Sheridan', 'catch', 'here', 'story', 'Gib', 'unwittingly', 'found', 'attracted', 'class', 'brain', 'English', 'class', 'Alison', 'certainly', 'not', 'type', 'girl', 'Gib', 'envisioned', 'nonetheless', 'attracted', 'Alison', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'someone', 'who', 'life', 'as', 'carefree', 'Gib', 'Alison', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'consulting', 'schedule', 'book', 'organizational', 'freak', 'who', 'incapable', 'doing', 'anything', 'spontaneous', 'When', 'Gib', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'anywhere', 'Lance', 'up', 'offer.When', 'Gib', 'ride', 'country', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Alison', 'also', 'signed', 'up', 'ride', 'same', 'car', 'way', 'visit', 'boyfriend', 'California.The', 'film', 'really', 'here', 'two', 'unlikely', 'people', 'begin', 'find', 'something', 'appealing', 'other', 'Alison', 'becoming', 'bit', 'more', 'loose', 'Gib', 'becoming', 'bit', 'more', 'responsible', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'Gib', 'California', 'sure', 'thing', 'bathing', 'beauty', 'type', 'girl', 'Gib', 'right', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'beauty', 'film', 'journey', 'not', 'end', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'two', 'people', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'Sunrise', 'Sure', 'Thing', 'right', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'realistic', 'easy', 'believe', 'what', 'happening', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'opposite', 'poles', 'other.Rob', 'Reiner', 'magnificent', 'job', 'director', 'film', 'pulse', 'characters', 'sure', 'nothing', 'forced', 'produce', 'ending', 'way', 'created', 'realistic', 'yet', 'simplistic', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'fallen', 'love', 'someone', 'who', 'completely', 'opposite', 'how', 'two', 'people', 'situation', 'can', 'really', 'learn', 'someone', 'else.This', 'one', 'two', 'favorite', 'roles', 'played', 'John', 'Cusack', 'simply', 'Gib', 'down', 'cold', 'Say', 'Anything', 'other', 'favorite', 'Cusack', 'able', 'play', 'Gib', 'effort', 'inside', 'very', 'likeable', 'person', 'flaws', 'Daphne', 'Zuniga', 'equally', 'good', 'uptight', 'Alison', 'sweaters', 'looking', 'ultra-conservative', 'Daphne', 'beautiful', 'girl', ""n't"", 'over-the-top', 'gorgeous', 'important', 'movie', 'physical', 'attraction', 'NOT', 'what', 'two', 'characters.I', 'watch', 'movie', 'whenever', 'feel', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'tickles', 'funny', 'bone', 'as', 'well', 'warms', 'heart']",N/A
449158,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,6305113092,Silver Screen,"[8, 8]","""The Sure Thing"" (1985) is perhaps one of the most underrated comedies of an era that was bursting at the seams with romantic comedies.John Cusack stars as Walter Gibson (""Gib""), a college freshman who is attending school at an unnamed Ivy League college.  He is disappointed that his romantic life is somewhat lacking (although, inexplicably, his unattractive, overweight roommate is scoring a lot of action) but sees hope with Alison (Daphne Zuniga), an extremely uptight, prissy girl who adheres to routine like a religion that is in his English class.  Gib's high school friend Lance (Anthony Edwards, just before his breakout in ""Top Gun"") has gone to school out in Southern California and invites Gib to come out over the Christmas break as Lance has a girl that is a ""sure thing"" and Gib is sure to score.  Gib ends up in a cross-country adventure with the prissy Alison, heading out to California to visit her equally uptight and unexciting fiance Jason (Boyd Gaines), and nutty Gary Cooper (Tim Robbins, in an early film role) - - ""but not that Gary Cooper that's dead"" and Mary Ann (Lisa Ann Persky), two people that are so perky and into showtunes that you wish that Gib would hurl himself out the car window.As can be expected, Gib and Alison develop feelings for one another during the road trip.  What happens when they get to California?  Will Gib hook up with The Sure Thing (Nicollette Sheridan)?  Will Alison stay engaged to Jason?  Will she realize that Gib is perfect for her?The ending should be absolutely no surprise but the journey is all the fun.Rob Reiner does a terrific job with this little film, and John Cusack is simply awesome!  This role, along with Lloyd Dobler from ""Say Anything"", really put him on the map.  His Gib comes across as a funny, romantic, touching guy - - not a partyer, not a horndog.  You can really relate to Gib, and that makes him real.  And it makes the movie work.

As the movie opens, Walter ""Gib"" Gibson (John Cusack) and his best friend Lance (Anthony Edwards) have graduated from high school, and are going to do colleges, that on both coasts, Lance is going to Calfiorna, and John is headed for an Ivy League School, but they still keep in touch, even if they are miles apart, one his new classmates is Alison Bradbury (Daphne Zuniga) in an English class, that Walter is failing, taught by Prof. Taub (Viveca Lindfors). But he manges to get her help on an assignment to re-wrote the one he had to do the week before. And then that is when the freuding between these starts to happen, and even during the road trip, when Alison misses her boyfriend Jason (Boyd Gaines), and Walter gets a call from Lance, that he can get him a date with The Sure Thing (Nicollette Sheridan) that is in Los Angeles during Winter Break, until the 23rd of December, so he checks the broads at college to find a way to get there, even if that must mean he has to take the trip and sleepin in hotels with Alison.
