361798,AKV9F8HZ7XX0B,6303182135,AC,"[3, 4]","I own a lot of exercise videos, in VHS and DVD formats, and I perhaps utilize them in a way that not everyone does -- I initially watch them to simply see whether there is anything -- and even if it's one exercise, idea, technique, sequencing, or piece of advice -- that is different or otherwise useful in a way that appeals to me, and subsequently expands my 'repertoire', or results in my modifying (or replacing) an existing method, etc. -- if even one such thing is associated with my 'introduction' to a given video, then I consider it to have been of benefit.Not surprisingly, many videos involve exercises that are common to many other videos, and thus for some fitness videos, I might see nothing that truly stands out or is in any way different from what I've seen elsewhere.Additionally, I do not subscribe to the thinking that seems prevalent in many realms, and involves 'newer' somehow being equated with 'better' -- I'm aware that there are many 'oldies but goodies', and can look past the associated (and usually not-so-appealing) music, outfits, and era-specific hairstyles -- it doesn't affect my motivation, and the importance of the 'what' and 'how' contained within trump any seemingly 'cosmetic' aspects.I'd heard of the 'Buns of Steel' video many years ago, and found myself curious as to why it had become famous -- and especially wondered whether its popularity was due to anything 'special' about the production.  Well, not long into viewing a VHS version of the original 'Buns of Steel', I definitely 'took notice' -- this was not anything like the various forms of 'fluff' I'd seen in miscellaneous 1980s fitness videos -- no, the original 'Buns of Steel' production can and does still 'hold its own', exercise quality-wise, when compared to so many other fitness videos.In viewing this the first time, I was also surprised by how it wasn't just one, or even 'just a few' things that I took note of, and could tell would be effective in 'working' the relevant region (and in a way that was 'friendly' to my knees) -- the whole darn production stands out -- it was one 'yes' after another, when it came to my 'flagging' the different exercises for my use... I was and am impressed -- the exercises utilized in this video are still embraced by many of us today because they work, and I haven't found (and don't expect to find) a true 'replacement' video for this 'routine' (that being said, aspects of some of the exercises would now be considered more representative of certain 'specialties' within the fitness genre (with some Lotte Berk, Bar Method, and Ballet Beautiful -esque aspects found in the video -- which, to an extent, could potentially be interpreted as this video having been somewhat 'ahead of its time', though all in all, it is simply a terrific combination of well-chosen and effective exercises, and ones which were selected for targetting development of a specific region of the body).If I had to choose from among my (many) exercise videos, and create a kind of Top Ten list, this video would be among them -- I don't care about the 'when' of its creation, as it's the quality of exercise selection (and associated effectiveness), and the overall usefulness value, that matter most to me.",5,This 20+ -year old production is still utilized by many for a reason -- it really is that good,1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,3236,"['own', 'lot', 'exercise', 'videos', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'formats', 'perhaps', 'utilize', 'way', 'not', 'everyone', 'initially', 'watch', 'simply', 'see', 'anything', 'even', 'one', 'exercise', 'idea', 'technique', 'sequencing', 'piece', 'advice', 'different', 'otherwise', 'useful', 'way', 'appeals', 'subsequently', ""'repertoire"", 'results', 'modifying', 'replacing', 'existing', 'method', 'etc', 'even', 'one', 'such', 'thing', 'associated', ""'introduction"", 'given', 'video', 'then', 'consider', 'have', 'been', 'benefit.Not', 'surprisingly', 'many', 'videos', 'involve', 'exercises', 'are', 'common', 'many', 'other', 'videos', 'thus', 'fitness', 'videos', 'might', 'see', 'nothing', 'truly', 'out', 'way', 'different', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'elsewhere.Additionally', 'do', 'not', 'subscribe', 'thinking', 'prevalent', 'many', 'realms', ""'newer"", 'somehow', 'being', 'equated', ""'better"", ""'m"", 'aware', 'are', 'many', ""'oldies"", 'goodies', 'can', 'look', 'associated', 'usually', 'not-so-appealing', 'music', 'outfits', 'era-specific', 'hairstyles', ""n't"", 'affect', 'motivation', 'importance', ""'what"", ""'how"", 'contained', 'trump', 'seemingly', ""'cosmetic"", 'aspects.I', ""'d"", 'heard', ""'Buns"", 'Steel', 'video', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'found', 'curious', 'why', 'had', 'become', 'famous', 'especially', 'wondered', 'popularity', 'was', 'due', 'anything', ""'special"", 'production', 'Well', 'not', 'long', 'viewing', 'VHS', 'version', 'original', ""'Buns"", 'Steel', 'definitely', ""'took"", 'notice', 'was', 'not', 'anything', 'various', 'forms', ""'fluff"", ""'d"", 'seen', 'miscellaneous', '1980s', 'fitness', 'videos', 'original', ""'Buns"", 'Steel', 'production', 'can', 'still', ""'hold"", 'own', 'exercise', 'quality-wise', 'when', 'compared', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'fitness', 'videos.In', 'viewing', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'how', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'even', 'few', 'things', 'took', 'note', 'could', 'tell', 'would', 'be', 'effective', ""'working"", 'relevant', 'region', 'way', 'was', ""'friendly"", 'knees', 'whole', 'darn', 'production', 'out', 'was', 'one', ""'yes"", 'when', 'came', ""'flagging"", 'different', 'exercises', 'use', 'was', 'am', 'impressed', 'exercises', 'utilized', 'video', 'are', 'still', 'embraced', 'many', 'today', 'work', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'find', 'true', ""'replacement"", 'video', ""'routine"", 'being', 'said', 'aspects', 'exercises', 'would', 'now', 'be', 'considered', 'more', 'representative', 'certain', ""'specialties"", 'fitness', 'genre', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'Bar', 'Method', 'Ballet', 'Beautiful', '-esque', 'found', 'video', 'extent', 'could', 'potentially', 'be', 'interpreted', 'video', 'having', 'been', 'somewhat', ""'ahead"", 'time', 'simply', 'terrific', 'combination', 'well-chosen', 'effective', 'exercises', 'ones', 'were', 'selected', 'targetting', 'development', 'specific', 'region', 'body', '.If', 'had', 'choose', 'many', 'exercise', 'videos', 'create', 'kind', 'Top', 'Ten', 'list', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""'when"", 'creation', 'quality', 'exercise', 'selection', 'associated', 'effectiveness', 'overall', 'usefulness', 'value', 'matter', 'most']",The Original Buns of Steel VHS
361799,A1SOIIKQ8A379X,6303182135,Amazon Customer,"[14, 14]","So far the ONLY video that I EVER gave a 5 to in my life, has cheesy 80's music, mullets galore, and is led by Chuck Norris's feminine doppelganger, the lovable Greg Smithey.The Original Buns of Steel is an unintentionally campy video that came out in the 80's made me lose a pants size in a week despite my terrible diet of all-you-can-eat cereal, sugar and froyo. That said, It took discipline to lay there on the mat and do leg lift after leg lift while feeling like my butt was on fire. Just when you're about to give up, Greg Smithey busts out with ""We're gonna squeeze those cheeseburgers out of those hips, yeah!"" And he means it. Greg seems sincere. I don't want to let him down so I finish the video.There's a warm up & arm workout that I usually skip, the rest is all mat work. However, I happen to like exercising while laying down (that's what she said) and I've never had results like this from any other workout. I have tried everything, as you will see when you read the rest of my upcoming reviews.I'm short. My legs look short when they are not in shape. This video made my legs look better than they have ever looked (my legs didn't look this good even when I was in a ballet company!). No lunges, no squats, no equipment, just you and a mat or a towel to lay on.Once you learn the moves, you can even play your own inspiring music, such as ""I like Big Butts"" by Sir Mix-a-lot or ""Push It"" by Salt `n Peppa.Sadly, I had to cut back a lot on doing this video because the nerves in my outer leg would burn at night and Buns of Steel made the burning more frequent. The nerve issue in my leg existed before Buns of Steel. Buns of Steel did not cause the Meralgia Paresthetica. Don't ever be a ballet dancer. Your feet and legs will thank you someday.Don't waste your time on the inferior Buns of Steel videos that came out after Greg Smithey's original. They stink.

361800,A1HEAEFW8BTI5P,6303182135,Blue,"[0, 0]","For some reason, must workout videos targeting the thighs and butt tend to have you lunge a  lot. As a former gymnast, any repetitive lunging makes my upper thighs huge. It simply builds up the targeted areas instead of slimming. The original Buns of Steel workout is fantastic for me because it's nearly all floorwork, which seems to slim and lengthen the muscles as opposed to building bulk. I've used this video on and off for the past 16 years. I can honestly say that this is the only workout I've ever done where my butt looks better almost immediately. I can definitely tell when I use it, and when I take a break. Most certainly, the fashions are 80s-delux with lycra for days, as are the hairstyles. Even though I've now heard Greg Smithey say the same encouraging phrases so often that I can quote them line by line, I enjoy his calm and positive demeanor way more than a lot of the high intensity workout trainers. If you don't like to feel as if you're being shouted at while you work out, then Greg Smithey is just what you need. Also, and this is just a personal choice, but I enjoy the less than perfectly toned 1980s physiques way more than watching highly tanned borderline-bathing suit models jump around. It's better for the self-esteem. Overall, I would highly recommend this workout video.

So many trends come and go with workouts and who buys a workout tape for style? Results are what matter, not fashion sense. I personally love 80s retro so it just makes it that much more fun to do it.I do yoga, pilates, taebo and this tape because of everything I have tried they consistently work for me. Every other tape or dvd sits and collects dust because they don't do it for me! Everytime I watch it,it takes me back to the 80s when I was a teenager using this tape and that helps motivate me to keep a teenaged figure and those buns of steel!I REALLY hope they put this on DVD someday and that Greg Smithey does his own sequels, but in the meantime I have had a friend make me one from this tape so I could travel with it.Pull out your headbands and work those buns!",5,"Can't Be Beat, Better Than Stairclimber",1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,1349,"['was', 'first', 'exercise', 'video', 'ever', 'bought', 'year', 'was', 'released', 'still', 'best', 'one', 'there', 'IMHO', 'have', 'pretty', 'big', 'collection', 'exercise', 'videos', 'still', 'favorite', 'am', 'now', 'third', 'copy', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'stopped', 'using', 'several', 'years', 'grew', 'saddlebags', 'remembered', 'tape', 'decided', 'see', 'could', 'find', 'copy', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did.I', 'always', 'loved', 'how', 'Greg', 'Smithey', 'really', 'kept', 'going', 'cheesy', 'encouragent', 'made', 'laugh', 'really', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'would', 'get', 'brutal', 'tape', 'So', 'many', 'trends', 'come', 'go', 'workouts', 'who', 'workout', 'tape', 'style', 'Results', 'are', 'what', 'matter', 'not', 'fashion', 'sense', 'personally', 'love', '80s', 'retro', 'just', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'do', 'it.I', 'do', 'yoga', 'pilates', 'taebo', 'tape', 'everything', 'have', 'tried', 'consistently', 'work', 'other', 'tape', 'dvd', 'sits', 'collects', 'dust', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'Everytime', 'watch', 'back', '80s', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'using', 'tape', 'motivate', 'keep', 'teenaged', 'figure', 'buns', 'steel', 'REALLY', 'hope', 'put', 'DVD', 'someday', 'Greg', 'Smithey', 'own', 'sequels', 'meantime', 'have', 'had', 'friend', 'make', 'one', 'tape', 'could', 'travel', 'it.Pull', 'headbands', 'work', 'buns']",The Original Buns of Steel VHS

At the time I was in great shape doing triathlons and weight training, so I was more than a little sceptical -- however I must admit it does work, at least it can produce the good muscle burn that I normally associate with weight training.  It will also work for you no matter how fit or unfit you are, since you control how hard you contract your muscles the fitter you are the harder you can contract your muscles.  This is equivalent to a well focused weights session.
