It just might be because these 6 seasons are the ones everyone enjoys the most. I have all 6 seasons and I guess it would be nice to have the others. I would also like the remaining season of The Jeffersons. These shows are funny and I enjoy them. I only wonder why isn't Sony releasing more?

1036644,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000KX0IPY,andy8047,"[9, 11]","The 1975-76 season,the sixth of All In The Family,begins with Gloria Bunker Stivic(Sally Struthers) and her ""Meathead"" husband Michael(Rob Reiner) ""movin' on up"" to a place of their own in their former next-door-neighbors' home,occupied by George,Louise and Lionel Jefferson who had moved to a ""dee-luxe apartment in the sky"" in Manhattan(George's brother Henry even lived with them for a while). Another major highlight is Gloria giving birth to her and Michael's son Joey. I incorrectly mentioned this in the review for the season 5 set. Gloria's father Archie(the late great Carroll O'Connor),coming from a minstrel show in blackface,and her mother Edith(Jean Stapleton) arrive at the hospital in time to meet their new grandson. Archie accidentally entered a room occupied by a female patient who had long blonde hair like Gloria. The horrified woman phoned for help(""There's a big fat black man in here!""). Also there's one episode where Edith was upset with Archie because he hardly romances her and takes her anywhere anymore like he did when they were dating. So she goes to ""where the action is"". That place is Kelsey's Bar,the neighborhood pub in the Bunkers' and Stivics' hometown of Queens. Archie had been laid off from his job as a loading dock foreman and invites a Hispanic woman named Teresa Betancourt(Liz Torres,recurringly) to rent one of the bedrooms in the Bunker home(Gloria and Mike previously slept in that bedroom,she also used it as a growing-up child) for income. I also mentioned incorrectly in the season 5 set that Archie has his own chair in the Stivics' home like he has in his own house. We see Edith in the Stivics' home for the first time since she bid adieu to Louise Jefferson just before her big move to Manhattan with her husband George and their son Lionel during season 5,bringing on the premiere of The Jeffersons. I don't think we saw Archie in that house previously,but we saw him standing outside it in a season 1 episode talking to former resident Jim Bowman(the late pre-Frank Lorenzo Vincent Gardenia). The other episodes are great. This CBS sitcom was still in the Top 10 in 1975-76 along with The Jeffersons,AITF's ""grandchild"" Good Times and two other CBS sitcoms,M*A*S*H and Rhoda(spinoff of The Mary Tyler Moore Show).

1036645,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B000KX0IPY,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[2, 2]","This was probably one of the biggest hurdles to this series. (At least until Michael and Gloria moved away after season 8.) During season 5, the Jefforsons moved away and Michael and Gloria moved next door. To be sure, Irene Lorenzo stayed for a few more episdoes. And Michael and Archie could still have their disputes. But they weren't immediately available anymore.But that said, the series did seem to do well despite the new difficulties. In ""The Very Moving Day,"" we see that Gloria is going to have a child soon. In ""Alone At Last""  Michael makes a funny declaration of independence with Archie right before he realizes that he isn't quite ready to move.""Archie the Hero"" is a funny story. Archie thinks he has saved a woman's life with 'mouth to mouth,' but he soon finds he has saved the life of a female impersonator. (Beverly would return in Season 7's ""Beverly Rides Again,"" and then have a tragic end in Season 8's ""Edith's Crisis of Faith."")""Chain Letter"" is a funny episdoe where Archie thinks he is cursed because he failed to send on a chain letter from Irene.""Gloria Is Nervous"" is cute. We might find ourselves on Michael's side when he isn't too anxious to attend a baby shower taking photos of 'preppy pregos.' Saint Irene comes to the rescue.Later Gloria has her son Joey.""Archie Finds a Friend"" is somewhat of a sad episdoe. ""Archie's Weighty Problem"" shows us the pains of dieting.A real gem is ""Joey's Baptism."" Atheist Michael doesn't want to baptize his son, and Archie takes it upon himself. He may be going against Michael's wishes, but somehow, we get the impression that the writer wants us on Archie's side.Perhaps the best episdoe is ""Gloria and Mike's Guests."" Due to a broken furnace, Archie and Edith have to spend the night at Michael and Gloria's. And Michael gets a huge taste of the trials he had put Archie through for 5 years.This series proved that even after losing the Jeffersons, after Michael and Gloria moving next door, and Irene appearing only now and then, ""All In the Family"" was still running strong.Bring on Season 7.",3,Gems In a Difficult Season,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,2071,"['was', 'probably', 'one', 'biggest', 'hurdles', 'series', 'least', 'Michael', 'Gloria', 'moved', 'away', 'season', '8', 'season', '5', 'Jefforsons', 'moved', 'away', 'Michael', 'Gloria', 'moved', 'next', 'door', 'be', 'sure', 'Irene', 'Lorenzo', 'stayed', 'few', 'more', 'episdoes', 'Michael', 'Archie', 'could', 'still', 'have', 'disputes', 'were', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'available', 'anymore.But', 'said', 'series', 'did', 'seem', 'do', 'well', 'new', 'difficulties', 'Very', 'Moving', 'Day', 'see', 'Gloria', 'going', 'have', 'child', 'soon', 'Alone', 'Last', 'Michael', 'funny', 'declaration', 'independence', 'Archie', 'right', ""n't"", 'quite', 'ready', 'move', 'Hero', 'funny', 'story', 'Archie', 'saved', 'woman', 'life', ""'mouth"", 'mouth', 'soon', 'saved', 'life', 'female', 'impersonator', 'Beverly', 'would', 'return', 'Season', '7', 'Beverly', 'Rides', 'Again', 'then', 'have', 'tragic', 'end', 'Season', '8', 'Edith', 'Crisis', 'Faith', 'Chain', 'Letter', 'funny', 'episdoe', 'where', 'Archie', 'cursed', 'failed', 'send', 'chain', 'letter', 'Irene', 'Gloria', 'Nervous', 'cute', 'might', 'find', 'Michael', 'side', 'when', ""n't"", 'too', 'anxious', 'attend', 'baby', 'shower', 'taking', 'photos', ""'preppy"", 'pregos', 'Saint', 'Irene', 'rescue.Later', 'Gloria', 'son', 'Joey', 'Archie', 'Friend', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'episdoe', 'Archie', 'Weighty', 'Problem', 'pains', 'dieting.A', 'real', 'gem', 'Joey', 'Baptism', 'Atheist', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'want', 'baptize', 'son', 'Archie', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'Michael', 'wishes', 'somehow', 'get', 'impression', 'writer', 'Archie', 'side.Perhaps', 'best', 'episdoe', 'Gloria', 'Mike', 'Guests', 'Due', 'broken', 'furnace', 'Archie', 'Edith', 'have', 'spend', 'night', 'Michael', 'Gloria', 'Michael', 'huge', 'taste', 'trials', 'had', 'put', 'Archie', '5', 'years.This', 'series', 'proved', 'even', 'losing', 'Jeffersons', 'Michael', 'Gloria', 'moving', 'next', 'door', 'Irene', 'appearing', 'only', 'now', 'then', 'Family', 'was', 'still', 'running', 'strong.Bring', 'Season', '7']",All in the Family: Season 6

It's a shame that they got their hands on the NORMAN LEAR shows.  It really is.  They don't know how to give the proper respect to these timeless TV shows.  To take 11 years to release all of the Archie Bunker episodes is phenominally stupid.  The technology is changing so fast for one thing and why would a studio with time-proven classics on their hand purposely withhold them from the of the complaints are falling on deaf ears.  SONY Pictures really doesn't care about what the public wants.  I've been waiting years and years to see MARY HARTMAN, MARY HARTMAN again and have written and telephones SONY Pictures to no avail.  I've also been waiting for MAUDE to be released too.  Both of these shows were Norman Lear gems.  But SONY Pictures will not release these shows.  It's a shame because Norman Lear was THE television producer of the 1970's.  He conceived of one billiant classic after another.

1036651,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B000KX0IPY,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","I became an ""All in the Family"" fan in January 1971 when its first episode aired as a midseason replacement. For nine years I watched every episode, re-watched them during the summer, watched them yet again when the reruns hit daytime TV, and finally bought the DVDs when they were issued. Needless to say, I think it's one of the greatest comedy shows of all times.Season 6 was a transitional season. The Jeffersons were gone, having moved to their luxury apartment in Manhattan. However, they still owned the house next to the Bunkers, and gave Mike and Gloria a sweetheart deal so that they could move in. With the Stivics out of the Bunker house more episodes concentrated exclusively on Archie and Edith. However, Mike and Gloria continued to appear in many of the episodes. This includes several episodes dealing with Gloria's pregnancy and the eventual birth of little Joey.It also includes an episode that I find to be one of the funniest of all times. Archie gives CPR to a woman who passes out in the back of his car. Or at least he thinks it's a woman. Upon arriving at the Bunker house to give Archie a reward, the person tells Edith that he is a ""female impersonator."" Edith gets a baffled look on her face and says, ""Who better to impersonate a female than another woman,"" to which the female impersonator responds, ""I don't think you understand, Mrs. Bunker. I'm a transvestite."" Edith, who obviously has no idea what this means, responds, ""Oh. Well, you don't have an accent."" The dialog gets even more hilarious when Archie arrives in the room, convinced that the impersonator is really a woman, until he pulls off his wig and reveals a nearly bald head.",5,The laughs continue,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,1671,"['became', 'Family', 'fan', 'January', '1971', 'when', 'first', 'episode', 'aired', 'midseason', 'replacement', 'nine', 'years', 'watched', 'episode', 're-watched', 'summer', 'watched', 'yet', 'again', 'when', 'reruns', 'hit', 'daytime', 'TV', 'finally', 'bought', 'DVDs', 'when', 'were', 'issued', 'Needless', 'say', 'think', 'one', 'greatest', 'comedy', 'shows', 'times.Season', '6', 'was', 'transitional', 'season', 'Jeffersons', 'were', 'gone', 'having', 'moved', 'luxury', 'apartment', 'Manhattan', 'However', 'still', 'owned', 'house', 'Bunkers', 'gave', 'Mike', 'Gloria', 'sweetheart', 'deal', 'could', 'move', 'Stivics', 'Bunker', 'house', 'more', 'episodes', 'concentrated', 'exclusively', 'Archie', 'Edith', 'However', 'Mike', 'Gloria', 'continued', 'appear', 'many', 'episodes', 'several', 'episodes', 'dealing', 'Gloria', 'pregnancy', 'eventual', 'birth', 'little', 'Joey.It', 'also', 'episode', 'find', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'times', 'Archie', 'CPR', 'woman', 'who', 'out', 'back', 'car', 'least', 'woman', 'arriving', 'Bunker', 'house', 'give', 'Archie', 'reward', 'person', 'Edith', 'female', 'impersonator', 'Edith', 'baffled', 'look', 'face', 'Who', 'better', 'impersonate', 'female', 'woman', 'female', 'impersonator', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'understand', 'Mrs.', 'Bunker', ""'m"", 'transvestite', 'Edith', 'who', 'obviously', 'idea', 'what', 'Oh', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'accent', 'dialog', 'even', 'more', 'hilarious', 'when', 'Archie', 'room', 'convinced', 'impersonator', 'really', 'woman', 'wig', 'nearly', 'bald', 'head']",All in the Family: Season 6

Normally, this stock fodder becomes ""jump the shark"" fodder, but in AitF's case, the producers remembered the show's roots and provided some riveting commentary while also trying to compete with ""Days of Our Lives"".While it's true the 6th season is the most variable yet, there are still a handful of strong episodes - thanks to AitF's original premise of discussing society's problems and foibles:* The Very Moving Day -- Gloria tells all she's pregnant season opener - Mike is ambivalent and the results are both funny and thought-provoking* Mike Faces Life -- Gloria is fired because she is pregnant* The Little Atheist -- Archie wants the baby to be Christian; Mike wants to let the baby decide what to believe in when it grows up and can decide for itself* Archie's Civil Rights -- Archie is mugged but is the one in trouble because of how he defended himself* Mike's Move -- Mike's own believes are put to the test when he's pitted against an African-American for a job opening (best ep. of season 6)* ""Archie's Weighty Problem"" - Archie has to lose weight, or else...  the family helps, but our ""liberal"" Mike sees fit to be a real donkey and eat chips in front of the guy anyway...Of course, not all is well in Bunkerville:* Gloria Suspects Mike (a reversal of a season 2 story; only this time it's Gloria who thinks Mike is cheating.  Re-using old plots is clearly shark bait.)* New Year's Wedding (Mike summarily makes decisions -- a bit contrived to making its case.  It seems more a piece on pop-culture psychobabble than anything else.)* ""Love By Appointment"" (Mike and Gloria have no time to get jiggy; and Mike accuses Gloria that their son will end up suffering from ""Momism"" because she's always there and he is not.  Note:  1970s psychology was often anti-female.  Was there ever a ""Dadism"" as there are women who partner rather than marry too...)* ""Gloria and Mike's Houseguest"" (Archie and Mike, forced together - again.)The other episodes are ""average"" when the day is said and done.All in all, this is a good season, but it's also clear the sharks are hungry as the opening credits were sung faster by Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton, with the removal of the episode epilogues.  (Could the latter be due to syndication cuts?)Video and audio quality are what can be expected when cramming a high number of episodes onto one disc; never mind the quality of the source video tape.  All the money in the world could only do so much...Definitely worth a rent, if not purchase, but from here on out expect the topical stories to get more watered down; the ""sweeps week"" episodes being more character-driven than societal-observation -- the latter of which was how this series became popular in the first place.",4,"When the stork comes a'knockin', so does the shark... or does it?",1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,3375,"['Okay', 'when', 'bought', 'cared', 'only', 'episode', 'Mike', 'Move', 'terrific', 'reversal', 'opinions', 'Mike', 'Archie', 'season', 'opener', 'explain', 'how', 'Mike', 'bringing', 'children', 'world', 'problems', '.The', 'series', 'road', 'trying', 'be', 'typical', 'family', 'drama/sitcom', 'dwelling', 'more', 'characters', 'personal', 'lives', 'topical', 'situations', '1970s', 'highlight', 'episodes', 'season', 'definitely', 'remind', 'All', 'Family', ""n't"", 'quite', 'jumped', 'yet.And', 'better', 'way', 'become', 'typical', 'sitcom', 'drama', 'introducing', 'baby', 'mix', 'Normally', 'stock', 'fodder', 'jump', 'shark', 'fodder', 'AitF', 'case', 'producers', 'remembered', 'show', 'roots', 'provided', 'riveting', 'commentary', 'also', 'trying', 'compete', 'Days', 'Lives', 'true', '6th', 'season', 'most', 'variable', 'yet', 'are', 'still', 'handful', 'strong', 'episodes', 'thanks', 'AitF', 'original', 'premise', 'discussing', 'society', 'problems', 'foibles', '*', 'Very', 'Moving', 'Day', 'Gloria', 'pregnant', 'season', 'opener', 'Mike', 'ambivalent', 'results', 'are', 'funny', 'thought-provoking*', 'Mike', 'Faces', 'Life', 'Gloria', 'fired', 'pregnant*', 'Little', 'Atheist', 'Archie', 'baby', 'be', 'Christian', 'Mike', 'let', 'baby', 'decide', 'what', 'believe', 'when', 'can', 'decide', 'itself*', 'Archie', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Archie', 'mugged', 'one', 'trouble', 'how', 'defended', 'himself*', 'Mike', 'Move', 'Mike', 'own', 'are', 'put', 'test', 'when', 'pitted', 'African-American', 'job', 'opening', 'best', 'ep', 'season', '6', '*', 'Archie', 'Weighty', 'Problem', 'Archie', 'lose', 'weight', 'else', 'family', 'liberal', 'Mike', 'fit', 'be', 'real', 'donkey', 'eat', 'chips', 'front', 'guy', 'anyway', 'course', 'not', 'well', 'Bunkerville', '*', 'Gloria', 'Mike', 'reversal', 'season', '2', 'story', 'only', 'time', 'Gloria', 'who', 'Mike', 'cheating', 'Re-using', 'old', 'plots', 'clearly', 'shark', 'bait', '*', 'New', 'Year', 'Wedding', 'Mike', 'summarily', 'decisions', 'bit', 'contrived', 'making', 'case', 'more', 'piece', 'pop-culture', 'psychobabble', 'anything', 'else', 'Love', 'Appointment', 'Mike', 'Gloria', 'have', 'time', 'get', 'jiggy', 'Mike', 'Gloria', 'son', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'suffering', 'Momism', 'always', 'there', 'not', 'Note', '1970s', 'psychology', 'was', 'often', 'anti-female', 'Was', 'there', 'ever', 'Dadism', 'are', 'women', 'who', 'partner', 'rather', 'marry', 'too', '*', 'Gloria', 'Mike', 'Houseguest', 'Archie', 'Mike', 'forced', 'together', 'again', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'average', 'when', 'day', 'said', 'done.All', 'good', 'season', 'also', 'clear', 'sharks', 'are', 'hungry', 'opening', 'credits', 'were', 'sung', 'faster', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'Jean', 'Stapleton', 'removal', 'episode', 'epilogues', 'Could', 'latter', 'be', 'due', 'syndication', 'cuts', 'Video', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'when', 'cramming', 'high', 'number', 'episodes', 'one', 'disc', 'never', 'quality', 'source', 'video', 'tape', 'money', 'world', 'could', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'Definitely', 'rent', 'not', 'purchase', 'here', 'out', 'expect', 'topical', 'stories', 'get', 'more', 'watered', 'down', 'sweeps', 'week', 'episodes', 'being', 'more', 'character-driven', 'societal-observation', 'latter', 'was', 'how', 'series', 'became', 'popular', 'first', 'place']",All in the Family: Season 6
