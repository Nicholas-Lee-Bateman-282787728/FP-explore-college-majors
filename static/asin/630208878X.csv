It's one of those movies that you  love to watch again and again.  Yes, I know Leonard Maltin gave it a bad  review, but I think you can tell by the other reviews here that he was  wrong this time around.  If you can find a copy of it, get it!",5,Still one of my favorite movies,965952000,"08 11, 2000",2000,358,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'loved', 'Repeated', 'viewings', 'then', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'feelings', 'one', 'movies', 'love', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'Yes', 'know', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'gave', 'bad', 'review', 'think', 'can', 'tell', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'was', 'wrong', 'time', 'around', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'get']",Don't Tell Her It's Me VHS

Shelly Long plays a romance novel writer who decides to give her brother a makeover, to help him win the girl  of his dreams.  What results is Steve Guttenberg as an Austrian biker  called &quot;Lobo&quot;.  The dialogue in this movie is hilarious, and the  casting couldn't have been better.  I hope this movie is re-printed.  The  video store I used to rent it from, lost the movie in a flood, and now I  can't find it anywhere.  For anyone who has the chance to see this movie,  do, you will not be disappointed.",5,"Great, Funny, Great!",956880000,"04 28, 2000",2000,629,"['one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'comedies', 'ever', 'Shelly', 'Long', 'romance', 'novel', 'writer', 'who', 'give', 'brother', 'makeover', 'help', 'win', 'girl', 'dreams', 'What', 'results', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'Austrian', 'biker', 'called', 'quot', 'Lobo', 'quot', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'casting', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'hope', 'movie', 're-printed', 'video', 'store', 'used', 'rent', 'lost', 'movie', 'flood', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anywhere', 'anyone', 'who', 'chance', 'see', 'movie', 'do', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Don't Tell Her It's Me VHS

We watched it many times since, and I thought it was time to buy it before our copy would finally give up and &quot;die&quot; on us. Boy, was I surprized to see that it wasn't in print. I got up right away to brake the safety tab out of the cassette to make sure nobody is taping over it by accident.
