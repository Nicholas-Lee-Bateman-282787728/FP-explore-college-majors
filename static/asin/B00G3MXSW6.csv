1676459,A1O6OZ0NNH3CR4,B00G3MXSW6,Chuck Snow,"[6, 6]","This is an enjoyable farce about a group of middle-aged Gay guys toiling in the West Hollywood disctrict of Los Angeles. It has the feel of a full-feature film, but it was apparently released as an online TV series. The chapters run about 7 minutes each. Well, for the DVD release, they should have done what regular networks do with their series, and that is show it in one continuous whole, instead, you have to either sit through the End Credits every 7 minutes, or have the Remote handy so you can jump to the next chapter - a drag. And that's why I give it only 3 stars.",3,Klutzy Format,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,575,"['enjoyable', 'farce', 'group', 'middle-aged', 'Gay', 'guys', 'toiling', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'disctrict', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'feel', 'full-feature', 'film', 'was', 'apparently', 'released', 'online', 'TV', 'series', 'chapters', 'run', '7', 'minutes', 'Well', 'DVD', 'release', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'what', 'regular', 'networks', 'do', 'series', 'show', 'one', 'continuous', 'whole', 'instead', 'have', 'sit', 'End', 'Credits', '7', 'minutes', 'have', 'Remote', 'so', 'can', 'jump', 'next', 'chapter', 'drag', 'why', 'give', 'only', '3', 'stars']",Old Dogs & New Tricks

I hadn't seen it online, so the DVD was my first viewing.What a disappointment! It may be relevant to aging gay men in West Hollywood, but to real aging gay men living real lives in the real world? No way.It's the same old hard-driving, bitchy, super-competitive crap that comes spewing out of West Hollywood constantly. SOMEBODY finds that life appealing, but not me.There's nothing new or entertaining here, just older characters living the same boring, driven, shallow lives that evidently are what's considered normal in that tiresome place.",1,"Young OR old, West Hollywood is shallow and boring",1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,619,"[""'m"", '50', 'so', 'was', 'excited', 'find', 'series', 'people', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'online', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'disappointment', 'may', 'be', 'relevant', 'aging', 'gay', 'men', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'real', 'aging', 'gay', 'men', 'living', 'real', 'lives', 'real', 'world', 'way.It', 'same', 'old', 'hard-driving', 'bitchy', 'super-competitive', 'crap', 'spewing', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'constantly', 'SOMEBODY', 'life', 'appealing', 'not', 'nothing', 'new', 'entertaining', 'here', 'just', 'older', 'characters', 'living', 'same', 'boring', 'driven', 'shallow', 'evidently', 'are', 'what', 'considered', 'normal', 'tiresome', 'place']",Old Dogs & New Tricks

But I found it very funny and very entertaining as well as poignant. There's everything from the gym bunny to the newly 50-year-old wondering if he still has a change at a life of happiness. There's the older actor whose day in the lime light has begun to fade and the well hung Brit-style pop musician with the very large member. It's fun and these guys as a group of men really seem to care for one another. There are some real surprises throughout this 2 season disc. I recommend it!",4,Very funny and entertaining,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,594,"['When', 'first', 'watched', 'pilot', '2', 'season', 'disc', 'was', ""n't"", 'certain', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'show', 'found', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'poignant', 'everything', 'gym', 'bunny', 'newly', '50-year-old', 'wondering', 'still', 'change', 'life', 'happiness', 'older', 'actor', 'day', 'lime', 'light', 'begun', 'fade', 'well', 'Brit-style', 'pop', 'musician', 'very', 'large', 'member', 'fun', 'guys', 'group', 'men', 'really', 'seem', 'care', 'one', 'are', 'real', 'surprises', '2', 'season', 'disc', 'recommend']",Old Dogs & New Tricks

1676463,AAEG0HBTCZ5EG,B00G3MXSW6,Melbybackatya,"[1, 1]",I bought this DVD and I LOVE the show.  And I was delighted to find one of my favorite comedy actors in the mix.  Playing the bitchy queen Nelson Bruce Hart was such a delight.  I have been a fan from afar of his appearances in other independent projects like &#34;The Trouble With Barry&#34;.  Old Dogs and New Tricks is so well turned out it's like a mini version of Sex in the City.  There are some wonderful moments such as when David Pevsner accidently hooks up on line with his friend Curt Bonnem.  And of course Leon Acord (with a fabulous head of hair) leads the fun.  Acord's scenes with his chums and his nemisis played by Hart are hysterical. There is also an obvious and wonderful spoof of a Dynasty water fight that includes Olympian Greg Louganis along with Acord and Hart as well.  Two thumbs up!!,5,Really rocking good time,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,812,"['bought', 'DVD', 'LOVE', 'show', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'actors', 'mix', 'Playing', 'bitchy', 'queen', 'Nelson', 'Bruce', 'Hart', 'was', 'such', 'delight', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'afar', 'appearances', 'other', 'independent', 'projects', '34', 'Trouble', 'Barry', '34', 'Old', 'Dogs', 'New', 'Tricks', 'so', 'well', 'turned', 'out', 'mini', 'version', 'Sex', 'City', 'are', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'David', 'Pevsner', 'accidently', 'up', 'line', 'friend', 'Curt', 'Bonnem', 'course', 'Leon', 'Acord', 'fabulous', 'head', 'hair', 'fun', 'Acord', 'scenes', 'chums', 'nemisis', 'played', 'Hart', 'are', 'hysterical', 'also', 'obvious', 'wonderful', 'spoof', 'Dynasty', 'water', 'fight', 'Olympian', 'Greg', 'Louganis', 'Acord', 'Hart', 'as', 'well', 'Two', 'thumbs', 'up']",Old Dogs & New Tricks
