973019,AM18CU72YEWH5,B000EHQUGC,A. J Terry,"[56, 65]","Not the Zeta-Jones version, but not the best documentary either. For example, during the documentary I kept wondering why Tsar Elizabeth imprisoned her ""son"" Ivan, naming her childish and unfit-to-rule nephew Peter as her heir. Then she was so anxious for Peter to have an heir that when none appeared after several years of marriage, she encouraged Catherine (Peter's wife) to have an affair with a young officer so she would get pregnant somehow. If Elizabeth was so very anxious for an heir to solidify her dynasty, why did she imprison her own son?Answer (from further research): Ivan was not Elizabeth's son, but the son of a previous empress. Elizabeth had deposed the child Ivan and his regents in a coup d'etat.If this documentary can make, and repeatedly mention, an error of such  magnitude . . .Also, the ""period"" dancing scene often shown to set a mood has absolutely nothing to do with period dances of the time. In general the costuming etc. is not very good.",3,Be careful about using this one to write your history paper,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,973,"['Not', 'Zeta-Jones', 'version', 'not', 'best', 'documentary', 'example', 'documentary', 'kept', 'wondering', 'why', 'Tsar', 'Elizabeth', 'imprisoned', 'son', 'Ivan', 'naming', 'childish', 'unfit-to-rule', 'nephew', 'Peter', 'heir', 'Then', 'was', 'so', 'anxious', 'Peter', 'have', 'heir', 'when', 'none', 'appeared', 'several', 'years', 'marriage', 'encouraged', 'Catherine', 'Peter', 'wife', 'have', 'affair', 'young', 'officer', 'would', 'get', 'pregnant', 'somehow', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'anxious', 'heir', 'solidify', 'dynasty', 'why', 'did', 'imprison', 'own', 'son', 'Answer', 'further', 'research', 'Ivan', 'was', 'not', 'Elizabeth', 'son', 'son', 'previous', 'empress', 'Elizabeth', 'had', 'deposed', 'child', 'Ivan', 'regents', 'coup', ""d'etat.If"", 'documentary', 'can', 'make', 'repeatedly', 'mention', 'error', 'such', 'magnitude', '.Also', 'period', 'dancing', 'scene', 'often', 'shown', 'set', 'mood', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'period', 'dances', 'time', 'general', 'costuming', 'etc', 'not', 'very', 'good']",N/A

She, Cathrine the Great, really was quite a woman in  her love for Russia and modernizing it.  She was quite the intellectual also.

Amazon.com has somehow gotten the not-so good Catherine Zeta-Jones series mixed up with the EXCELLENT PBS documentary!!!  (This happened once before, see my BURN review for the mix-up in formats on that release.)If you look at the box, you will see that it is NOT Catherine Zeta-Jones, but EMILY BRUNI (who does a wonderful job as Catherine.)  This is the PBS documentary, not the Zeta-Jones series!!! Amazon.com needs to fix the mix-up, or a lot of people will be very confused here.  This PBS documentary is EXCELLENT, and Emily Bruni is GREAT.  So, if you want to order the PBS documentary, I'd suggest you wait until it's finally released to make sure you get the right one...(I'd be pretty upset if I got Catherine Zeta-Jones instead of Emily Bruni.)The PBS documentary is wonderful, and Emily Bruni is a seductive, intelligent and fascinating Catherine.  As for the Catherine Zeta-Jones version...well...she was good in Chicago...Once in a while Amazon.com does mix things up, it is rare, but it does happen.  So make SURE you are getting the PBS documentary,and not the Catherine-Zeta Jones version.",5,WAIT A MOMENT....REVIEW THE RIGHT DVD GUYS!!!,1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,1147,"['OBVIOUSLY', 'confusion', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'somehow', 'gotten', 'not-so', 'good', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'series', 'mixed', 'up', 'EXCELLENT', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'happened', 'once', 'before', 'see', 'BURN', 'review', 'mix-up', 'formats', 'release', 'look', 'box', 'will', 'see', 'NOT', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'EMILY', 'BRUNI', 'who', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Catherine', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'not', 'Zeta-Jones', 'series', 'Amazon.com', 'fix', 'mix-up', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'confused', 'here', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'EXCELLENT', 'Emily', 'Bruni', 'GREAT', 'So', 'want', 'order', 'PBS', 'documentary', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'wait', 'finally', 'released', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'right', 'one', ""'d"", 'be', 'pretty', 'upset', 'got', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'instead', 'Emily', 'Bruni', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'wonderful', 'Emily', 'Bruni', 'seductive', 'intelligent', 'fascinating', 'Catherine', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'version', 'well', 'was', 'good', 'Chicago', 'Once', 'while', 'Amazon.com', 'mix', 'things', 'up', 'rare', 'happen', 'So', 'make', 'SURE', 'are', 'getting', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'not', 'Catherine-Zeta', 'Jones', 'version']",N/A
