The direction feels perfect for the well-told story (described elsewhere), and the cinematography is sharp, succinct, immaculately composed and nearly minimalistic.  Shots are blissfully allowed to evolve within the frame, undistracted by unneccessary panning/zooming/jiggling, etc.  The Director of Photography tells this tale elegantly with the sparse, direct language of truth.

Some of the critiques of the movie are true, a bit tedious in places, lingering silence, and distant shots of the characters.  But this was done on purpose, and powerfully adds to the tone of the movie, which is about loss and grief. Some have criticized the lead as coming across flat and dull; I loved his portrayal.  He's your average, not very intriguing, everyday kind of guy that perfectly depicts most people.  I could completely relate to his life.  So many details of the movie, in fact, are so average & everyday moments in life, I felt I was at home (check out trying to put the vacuum cleaner in the trunk of his step sister's car, only to find the trunk too full & putting it in the back seat; what's the point of this?, nothing; it's just the real everyday stuff of life that most of us have to deal with all the time). And into this ordinariness unexpected death rears its implacable head, disjointing everything and casting shadows even on the simplest of tasks. But the movie slowly progresses, ending on a note of hope. And though loss has left the two lead characters its bittersweet taste, life finds a way to instill some comfort and reinsert a will to keep on living.",4,Absolutely beautiful.,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,1276,"['real', 'gem', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'here', 'keeper', 'critiques', 'movie', 'are', 'true', 'bit', 'tedious', 'places', 'lingering', 'silence', 'distant', 'shots', 'characters', 'was', 'done', 'purpose', 'powerfully', 'tone', 'movie', 'loss', 'grief', 'have', 'criticized', 'lead', 'coming', 'flat', 'dull', 'loved', 'portrayal', 'average', 'not', 'very', 'intriguing', 'everyday', 'kind', 'guy', 'perfectly', 'most', 'people', 'could', 'completely', 'relate', 'life', 'So', 'many', 'details', 'movie', 'fact', 'are', 'so', 'average', 'everyday', 'moments', 'life', 'felt', 'was', 'home', 'check', 'out', 'trying', 'put', 'vacuum', 'cleaner', 'trunk', 'step', 'sister', 'car', 'only', 'find', 'trunk', 'too', 'full', 'putting', 'back', 'seat', 'what', 'point', 'nothing', 'just', 'real', 'everyday', 'stuff', 'life', 'most', 'have', 'deal', 'time', 'ordinariness', 'unexpected', 'death', 'rears', 'implacable', 'head', 'disjointing', 'everything', 'casting', 'shadows', 'even', 'simplest', 'tasks', 'movie', 'slowly', 'ending', 'note', 'hope', 'loss', 'left', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'bittersweet', 'taste', 'life', 'way', 'instill', 'comfort', 'reinsert', 'will', 'keep', 'living']",N/A
1316907,A4UFWKMQ2DPKJ,B00316DDZY,"Christoff ""SegredoAmazonico""","[2, 3]","This film is based on a very contemporary theme: social networking.  Jeff was Mark's best platonic friend, and upon Mark's sudden death in a car accident, Jeff goes through his e-m's and discovers that he had a long standing on-line association with Andrea in Italy, and the latter is about to visit Mark in Texas, as part of a planned trip to attend an Italian friend's wedding in New York.Jeff informs Andrea via e-mail about Mark's demise, and in subsequent e-ms he extends an invitation to Andrea to come down to Texas anyway, and stay with him for the planned 2 day visit.Jeff's stepsister shows up twice in the movie, with no real contribution to the story line, as does Mark's parents when Jeff delivers some of Mark's belongings to them, and the 3 people eat dinner in total silence.......... How does this contribute to the movie??This movie never really gets going - even after watching it a second time.  I feel the director was perhaps out of left field with this theme and the uncreative photography is rather annoying.Per Andrea's request, Jeff takes him to Mark's grave and they have a few discussions (at lunch/dinner) which revolved around the last conversations they each had with Mark, and specifically exchanging the last words they each said to Mark and his last words in return to each of them.Mark was a country music fan, which neither Jeff or Andrea cared for - yet a brief visit to a country bar by Jeff & Andrea is inserted into the movie.  Why - in honor of Mark??Andrea also brought with him a video which Mark had made of himself, singing a country song to Andrea.  Viewing this causes Jeff to start sobbing bitterly, and Andrea comforts him.Only during the latter part of Andrea's last of the 2 nights visiting Jeff, does he go to Jeff's room and starts caressing Jeff's face, which eventually wakes Jeff, and he reciprocates and they kiss a little.The next morning he takes Andrea to the airport to return to Italy, and Andrea invites Jeff to stay in touch and to even visit him in Italy - which Jeff undertakes to do.  Then we see the 2 men dawdling independently in the airport on the different sides of the passenger check-in with nothing emanating from this either.I give this movie 2 stars, because of Andrea being a likeable character (Alessandro Calza who plays Andrea, co-wrote the script), and because of the few moments of physical closeness the last night.  Will any viewer miss something if they never see this movie?  I honestly do not think so.For a list of better similar genre movies, see my review for ""Harvest"" also here at www.amazon.com",2,Below Average Film,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,2588,"['film', 'based', 'very', 'contemporary', 'theme', 'social', 'networking', 'Jeff', 'was', 'Mark', 'best', 'platonic', 'friend', 'Mark', 'sudden', 'death', 'car', 'accident', 'Jeff', 'e-m', 'discovers', 'had', 'long', 'standing', 'on-line', 'association', 'Andrea', 'Italy', 'latter', 'visit', 'Mark', 'Texas', 'part', 'planned', 'trip', 'attend', 'Italian', 'friend', 'wedding', 'New', 'York.Jeff', 'Andrea', 'e-mail', 'Mark', 'demise', 'subsequent', 'e-ms', 'invitation', 'Andrea', 'come', 'down', 'Texas', 'anyway', 'stay', 'planned', '2', 'day', 'visit.Jeff', 'stepsister', 'up', 'twice', 'movie', 'real', 'contribution', 'story', 'line', 'Mark', 'parents', 'when', 'Jeff', 'Mark', 'belongings', '3', 'people', 'eat', 'dinner', 'total', 'silence', 'How', 'contribute', 'movie', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'going', 'even', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'feel', 'director', 'was', 'perhaps', 'left', 'field', 'theme', 'uncreative', 'photography', 'rather', 'annoying.Per', 'Andrea', 'request', 'Jeff', 'Mark', 'grave', 'have', 'few', 'discussions', 'lunch/dinner', 'revolved', 'last', 'conversations', 'had', 'Mark', 'specifically', 'exchanging', 'last', 'words', 'said', 'Mark', 'last', 'words', 'return', 'them.Mark', 'was', 'country', 'music', 'fan', 'Jeff', 'Andrea', 'cared', 'yet', 'brief', 'visit', 'country', 'bar', 'Jeff', 'Andrea', 'inserted', 'movie', 'Why', 'honor', 'Mark', 'Andrea', 'also', 'brought', 'video', 'Mark', 'had', 'made', 'singing', 'country', 'song', 'Andrea', 'Viewing', 'Jeff', 'start', 'sobbing', 'bitterly', 'Andrea', 'him.Only', 'latter', 'part', 'Andrea', 'last', '2', 'nights', 'visiting', 'Jeff', 'go', 'Jeff', 'room', 'caressing', 'Jeff', 'face', 'eventually', 'Jeff', 'kiss', 'little.The', 'next', 'morning', 'Andrea', 'airport', 'return', 'Italy', 'Andrea', 'Jeff', 'stay', 'touch', 'even', 'visit', 'Italy', 'Jeff', 'undertakes', 'do', 'Then', 'see', '2', 'men', 'dawdling', 'independently', 'airport', 'different', 'sides', 'passenger', 'check-in', 'nothing', 'emanating', 'either.I', 'give', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'Andrea', 'being', 'likeable', 'character', 'Alessandro', 'Calza', 'who', 'Andrea', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'few', 'moments', 'physical', 'closeness', 'last', 'night', 'Will', 'viewer', 'miss', 'something', 'never', 'see', 'movie', 'honestly', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'so.For', 'list', 'better', 'similar', 'genre', 'movies', 'see', 'review', 'Harvest', 'also', 'here', 'www.amazon.com']",N/A
1316908,A3URJXN2X99D70,B00316DDZY,Cynthia Jendrejcak,"[14, 15]","This was a wonderfully subtle film. Although primarily focusing on Jeff and Andrea, there was always a powerful third character present- the overwhelming and mind-numbing grief both men felt for Mark.That grief was practically tangible throughout the entire film and I think those that enjoyed the film recognize that. And to those that say that the film felt disjointed and stilted, I say that it was a perfect expression of that intense grief.I liked the fact the fact that they (Andrea and Jeff) became intimate the way they did, it was sensual and plausible and more meaningful than any sort of a trope hookup. The minimalist music was fantastic and again, the stretches of absolute silence in the film added to the sensation of grief and loss. The ending worked for me as well, giving both men the reminder that there is a future without Mark, and that just maybe that future could include each other.",5,Heartwrenchingly Subtle - Beautiful,1276560000,"06 15, 2010",2010,906,"['was', 'wonderfully', 'subtle', 'film', 'primarily', 'focusing', 'Jeff', 'Andrea', 'was', 'always', 'powerful', 'third', 'character', 'present-', 'overwhelming', 'mind-numbing', 'grief', 'men', 'felt', 'Mark.That', 'grief', 'was', 'practically', 'tangible', 'entire', 'film', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'recognize', 'say', 'film', 'felt', 'disjointed', 'stilted', 'say', 'was', 'perfect', 'expression', 'intense', 'grief.I', 'liked', 'fact', 'fact', 'Andrea', 'Jeff', 'became', 'intimate', 'way', 'did', 'was', 'sensual', 'plausible', 'more', 'meaningful', 'sort', 'trope', 'hookup', 'minimalist', 'music', 'was', 'fantastic', 'again', 'stretches', 'absolute', 'silence', 'film', 'added', 'sensation', 'grief', 'loss', 'ending', 'worked', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'men', 'reminder', 'future', 'Mark', 'just', 'maybe', 'future', 'could', 'include', 'other']",N/A

1316910,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00316DDZY,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 8]","Made on the cheap with a no-name cast, this intentionally intimate 2008 drama focuses on the aftermath of an auto accident which killed a young man named Mark, in particular, the impact of his unexpected death on two men - one is his best friend and roommate Jeff, and the other is Andrea, a Genoese Italian with whom Mark has been corresponding online. Mark is shown in a brief silent bit at the very beginning and later in flashback episodes and videotape. Director Yen Tan keeps the story economical by then segueing into a series of e-mails between Jeff and Andrea, at which point we find out Mark died just as Andrea was coming to visit him. Touched by Andrea's sincerity, Jeff invites him to come anyway.What occurs from that point is not a predictable romance in typical queer cinema fashion but more the escalation of an unwieldy relationship that forms between the two survivors, neither of whom can quite accept Mark's death. It becomes clear that Jeff, a genuine mensch leading an unremarkable life, has unresolved feelings for Mark, and although he's out (thanks to Mark's influence), Jeff cannot liberate himself from the unrequited love he appears to covet. As you would expect, Andrea is serious eye candy with a conscience, a catch by most cinematic conventions, yet the filmmaker focuses on the tentative nature of their burgeoning relationship as an expression of both men's grief.The only other character in the movie is Jeff's acerbic Asian-American stepsister Lauren, played efficiently by Ethel Lung, but she seems to enter and exit merely to comment on the obvious. The pacing is absurdly slow with lots of close-ups and long takes with little action. As Jeff, Adam Neal Smith is sincere but overly bland, just not compelling enough to maintain the film's emotional pivot point. On the other hand, Alessandro Calza brings sensitivity to the somewhat idealized role of Andrea, perhaps not a coincidence since he is the co-screenwriter (with Tan). The movie slips by unobtrusively in a subdued, almost hushed tone, but despite some awkward moments, including an inevitable scene late in the film, the emotional honesty makes this worth seeing. The 2010 DVD includes a comprehensive if not altogether informative commentary track from Tan and Calza plus the original theatrical trailer.",3,"Subdued, Slow-Paced Look at Two Men Seeking Solace in Their Mutual Grief",1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,2306,"['Made', 'cheap', 'no-name', 'cast', 'intentionally', 'intimate', '2008', 'drama', 'aftermath', 'auto', 'accident', 'killed', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Mark', 'particular', 'impact', 'unexpected', 'death', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'best', 'friend', 'roommate', 'Jeff', 'other', 'Andrea', 'Genoese', 'Italian', 'whom', 'Mark', 'been', 'corresponding', 'online', 'Mark', 'shown', 'brief', 'silent', 'bit', 'very', 'beginning', 'later', 'flashback', 'episodes', 'videotape', 'Director', 'Yen', 'Tan', 'story', 'economical', 'then', 'segueing', 'series', 'e-mails', 'Jeff', 'Andrea', 'point', 'find', 'out', 'Mark', 'died', 'just', 'Andrea', 'was', 'coming', 'visit', 'Touched', 'Andrea', 'sincerity', 'Jeff', 'come', 'anyway.What', 'point', 'not', 'predictable', 'romance', 'typical', 'queer', 'cinema', 'fashion', 'more', 'escalation', 'unwieldy', 'relationship', 'two', 'survivors', 'whom', 'can', 'quite', 'accept', 'Mark', 'death', 'clear', 'Jeff', 'genuine', 'mensch', 'leading', 'unremarkable', 'life', 'unresolved', 'feelings', 'Mark', 'out', 'thanks', 'Mark', 'influence', 'Jeff', 'can', 'not', 'liberate', 'unrequited', 'love', 'covet', 'would', 'expect', 'Andrea', 'serious', 'eye', 'candy', 'conscience', 'catch', 'most', 'cinematic', 'conventions', 'yet', 'filmmaker', 'tentative', 'nature', 'burgeoning', 'relationship', 'expression', 'men', 'grief.The', 'only', 'other', 'character', 'movie', 'Jeff', 'acerbic', 'Asian-American', 'stepsister', 'Lauren', 'played', 'efficiently', 'Ethel', 'Lung', 'enter', 'exit', 'merely', 'comment', 'obvious', 'pacing', 'absurdly', 'slow', 'lots', 'close-ups', 'long', 'little', 'action', 'Jeff', 'Adam', 'Neal', 'Smith', 'sincere', 'overly', 'bland', 'just', 'not', 'compelling', 'enough', 'maintain', 'film', 'emotional', 'pivot', 'point', 'other', 'hand', 'Alessandro', 'Calza', 'sensitivity', 'somewhat', 'idealized', 'role', 'Andrea', 'perhaps', 'not', 'coincidence', 'co-screenwriter', 'Tan', 'movie', 'slips', 'unobtrusively', 'subdued', 'almost', 'hushed', 'tone', 'awkward', 'moments', 'including', 'inevitable', 'scene', 'late', 'film', 'emotional', 'honesty', 'worth', 'seeing', '2010', 'DVD', 'comprehensive', 'not', 'altogether', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'Tan', 'Calza', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

It's a three way love story, in different stage: Jeff and Mark were best friend, and probably Jeff felt something more for Mark, but Mark didn't have in him to feel the same for Jeff, he was his best friend but not his lover. But this doesn't mean that between Jeff and Mark there wasn't love, on the contrary, the love was even more steady and deep. Meanwhile Mark met Andrea online, and they started a long-distance relationship; it was a nice and beautiful thing, but I think that, from both side, it was not still something real... it was more a love with possibility. And maybe Mark was worried to hurt Jeff, and so he didn't tell him about Andrea. Then Mark suddenly died in a car accident, days before his first planning date with Andrea, that is flying from Italy to Texas to meet him. Jeff is faced with two painful revelation: he has lost his best friend Mark and it's the worst pain, but he has lost also his impossible dream of happiness, since he finds out that Mark was probably planning to build a life without him. So at once, Jeff looses best friend and lover. Maybe to face his fears, and to definitely destroy his dreams, Jeff asks to Andrea to still come in Texas: Jeff wants to face the reality, to close a chapter of his life and move on. Discovering that Andrea is a very good guy and not the usually losers Mark dated in the past is at the same time a good and bad thing: if Mark wasn't dead, he would have been a chance to happiness and not with Jeff.",5,Ciao (2008),1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,1566,"['Ciao', 'not', 'classical', 'romance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'apply', 'classical', 'rule', 'romance', 'three', 'way', 'story', 'different', 'stage', 'Jeff', 'Mark', 'were', 'best', 'friend', 'probably', 'Jeff', 'felt', 'something', 'more', 'Mark', 'Mark', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', 'same', 'Jeff', 'was', 'best', 'friend', 'not', 'lover', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Jeff', 'Mark', 'was', ""n't"", 'love', 'contrary', 'love', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'steady', 'deep', 'Meanwhile', 'Mark', 'met', 'Andrea', 'online', 'started', 'long-distance', 'relationship', 'was', 'nice', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'think', 'side', 'was', 'not', 'still', 'something', 'real', 'was', 'more', 'love', 'possibility', 'maybe', 'Mark', 'was', 'worried', 'hurt', 'Jeff', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'about', 'Andrea', 'Then', 'Mark', 'suddenly', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'days', 'first', 'planning', 'date', 'Andrea', 'flying', 'Italy', 'Texas', 'meet', 'Jeff', 'faced', 'two', 'painful', 'revelation', 'lost', 'best', 'friend', 'Mark', 'worst', 'pain', 'lost', 'also', 'impossible', 'dream', 'happiness', 'out', 'Mark', 'was', 'probably', 'planning', 'build', 'life', 'So', 'once', 'Jeff', 'best', 'friend', 'lover', 'Maybe', 'face', 'fears', 'definitely', 'destroy', 'dreams', 'Jeff', 'Andrea', 'still', 'come', 'Texas', 'Jeff', 'face', 'reality', 'close', 'chapter', 'life', 'move', 'Discovering', 'Andrea', 'very', 'good', 'guy', 'not', 'usually', 'Mark', 'dated', 'past', 'same', 'time', 'good', 'bad', 'thing', 'Mark', 'was', ""n't"", 'dead', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'chance', 'happiness', 'not', 'Jeff']",N/A
1316912,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00316DDZY,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","CIAO is a quiet little film - on more levels than one.  The title of the movie is well chosen: 'Ciao' can mean both hello and goodbye, and that is the essence of this subtle film. Written by director Yen Tan and actor Allesandro Calza it is a very contemporary story about love and enduring feelings.  The film takes its time, very literally, dwelling on still shots of doorways, paths, profiles, etc while the message of the film slowly surfaces.  It is more an elegy than a story and it works quite well.We first meet Jeff (Adam Neal Smith) as he is packing up the belongings of his longtime friend Mark who has just died, and in doing so he comes across Mark's computer and discovers messages to and from an Italian man named Andrea (Alessandro Calza), messages that define an internet relationship that ends with Mark's death.  Andrea doesn't know about Mark's passing and when Jeff answers one of the emails stating that Mark has died, Andrea states he is on his way to the US for a wedding and that he had planned to meet Mark face to face in Dallas.  Jeff extends the invitation to keep Andrea's plans, meets him at the airport, and invites him home where a long series of talks reveal the histories of both men and  reminiscences of Mark.  The mutual loss - one of a friend, the other of a potential love - mix and a new friendship of understanding and caring is born.  Much to the credit of the writing, directing and acting, the ending is unexpectedly real - again recalling the title of the movie.Some will find this film too slow and too 'empty', but for viewers who appreciate still life paintings and poetry, this film will satisfy.

He informs him he will be attending a wedding in New York and then will come to visit him on the 25th and leave on the 27th.The reply message is shocking!  It is Jeff (Adam Neal Smith) who writes a message back to Andrea. Jeff tells Andrea that Mark died in a car accident.  Jeff is a good friend of Mark's and was away in Houston when the accident happened.  He was going through Mark's many messages on the computer.Andrea replies back with his condolences and says it was a cheap ticket.The next night, Jeff can not sleep, so he gets on the computer and sends a message back to Andrea to go ahead with his plans and come anyway.

1316916,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B00316DDZY,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[5, 6]","((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form. Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again). Selection/purchase is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or your comments/reviews at major online film sales or review sites. Sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em). Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or sooner.......and some ""near-addictive"" as well). For some movies, I'll share a review with you, as follows. Thanks for sticking with me so far.))After three viewings (believe me, this film is so well done that repeats weren't hard to do), I'm ready to sit here and share with you.By writer / director intention, this is a ""grieving film"" (and you have been told, above, what it is not).  So now that you know their approach in this film, ask yourself, dear reader, the following question.  How shocking would it be for you to suddenly learn that, in the life of a now departed dearest friend (and unrequited love interest), there existed a far away, rival for the affections you had long sought?  For some of us that might be devastating.  So, with this plot lead-in out of the way, what we are left with for the remainder of this film are two grieving men who have been (and are still, it appears) in love with the same man.  Fate throws them together at this story's beginning, and as we watch we see ""feelings"" develop and grow between them.  At the same time, we come to realize that until this pair truly and completely comes to terms with the event that caused them to meet, there likely will be no future together for them.  (Although, to me the movie's ending gave hope that such a future might be delayed, but probably not denied).Oops, sorry about that......just watched the DVD Special Feature's Director & Writer Commentary, and these two guys seem to shoot down any intent of there being a future together for our two leads.  Plus in an offsite interview, writer/actor, Allesandro Calza (a bedroom-eyed hottie, playing Italian visitor, Andrea) says about his character and that of Adam Neal Smith (starring as Dallas-based Jeff):  ""....they are not attracted to each other.....they don't have sex together.....I don't think they develop a romance.""  WOW! says this viewer.  Just what is the audience to think happens after that extended kissing scene they give us to end a shot.....that when the camera pans away they'll frantically leap out of bed and run to opposite ends of the house from one another?  Yeah, sure.  Then, to further add to the expectations they've been building in us, at film's end we have Andrea extending an  invitation to visit his country.....as all the while the two are moving into a long, body against body, arms around one another, heads on shoulders--eyes closed, farewell embrace.  Such contradictory filmmaker statements about this couple's future together is certainly an unhappy note for we romantics in the audience. But always hopeful, I like to think that perhaps these two actors got together and decided to end run their bosses' intentions in the matter of down-the-road time together by giving a bit more in these two scenes than was scripted.....and that's why we actually saw what we saw (Hurray for our side!).To add to mention of this film's two noteworthy stars, one of the first things which hits us is the almost tangible chemistry between them. We've all heard of strangers meeting and immediately connecting, and here we sit watching an example of that occur. Before our eyes, two actors / characters begin coming together both emotionally and in the interests they share. Even more, as we witness the occasions on which this happens, there's a kind of quiet attraction that begins to pull us right into such scenes with them (thanks, in part, to frequent use of intense closeups).  Speaking of the cinematography, this film, to me, contains camera-work such as you've seldom or likely not seen: extended shots with static or little movement, involving both characters and everyday scenery. This approach seemed to produce strong feelings on this seasoned viewer's part of being intimately (!) drawn into a scene.....into a moment. Yes, there are many slow moving and contemplative times (a complaint of several professional reviewers)......so, if you're looking for fast action, e.g., hot clubbing, heavy-beat music, fast fu--s in the sack, this is not a film for you. However, if you're looking for something concerning the resilience of the human spirit, and hope that the future might bring love to those who've experienced deep loss, then this is a bang-up film for you.It's been a dry two-plus years since 2007's ""Shelter"" and even longer since that great, little French film, ""Just a Question of Love"" (2000).  So, am I disappointed this didn't turn out to be a romance?  You bet I am!  (But it'll still take a place on my ""Addictives Shelf"").PS--What's the bit with the skin tag?  (DVD Commentary has no mention of it, nor of a ""very, very"" long distance phone call. Absolutely no real details on the leads' working together---Film Commenters seem to have no idea what many of us out here would like to be told).",4,Sadly NOT a romance.......and

Logging onto Mark's email to inform people writing him that Mark has died in a car crash, Jeff discovers that Mark had been having an online relationship with Andrea, an Italian from Genova, Italy. Jeff finds correspondence between the two, and is surprised, and a bit troubled, by the openness in their conversations. This appeared to be a relationship that was deeper on some levels than he had with Mark. Jeff finds that Andrea was to visit Mark shortly for the first time, and already has the plane tickets, so he extends the invitation to Andrea that he should come stay with him for the two days.Both men had romantic love for Mark. In Jeff's case, it was never returned (Andrea explained that Mark was sorry he could not return those feelings to Jeff). Andrea loves Mark, but Marks death before their meeting leaves a very unique hole in his heart. Each man acts as a proxy for Mark, allowing them to share the feelings they had for Mark but will never get to express. The dialog and acting is a bit clumsy and forced at times, and some topics are only superficially touched upon, but the film, in its quiet contemplative way, clearly shares the pain these men feel, and their role to each other. When Andrea shows Jeff a video Mark made of a little country tune he wrote for Andrea, you feel the anguish of these men as if its your own. With only minor flaws, the strengths greatly shine in this film. Be forewarned, if you've ever bereaved a love, this film will strongly resonate with you. Its a marvelous gem. Now please excuse me.
