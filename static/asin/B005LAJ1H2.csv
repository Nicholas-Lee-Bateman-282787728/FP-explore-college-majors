Every single major character is scum.  Jimmy's mother practices incest, as was hinted at in the first season.  Jimmy commits patricide as his mother urges him on, following his attempt to strangle her.  Nucky is Nucky, which means he lies, cheats, steals, and murders anyone who gets in his way, all the time trying to stay clean, in the eyes of the law.  Margaret is scum.  She is a hypocrite of the highest order, as was Tony's wife, in The Sopranos.  The main FBI guy is scum.  He takes protection money, murders anyone getting on to his ways and, all the time, wrestles with his conscience as he fails to walk along the path of the righteous.  On and on and on and ----- Also, there are so many damn sub-plots going on at one time, in Season 2, that it is gets to the point of absurdity.  Too many characters doing each other, in all ways.  I can't stand the show, just as I came to hate The Sopranos.  I am having the same problem with BE, though, that I had with TS:  I have been caught up in the story line and now I have to see this series to its end.  Hopefully it won't run for as many seasons.  Maybe, just maybe, I'll let it go, and read the episode synopses once Season 3 is finished.

Flannery O'Conner did a brilliant spin of it in her short story The Lame Shall Enter First. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone that missed the second season. If you know the story of this very old tragedy, it will be easy to pick out the symbols early on in EB, or to pick it out in any film or story for that matter. If you see a young man with a wounded or crippled foot (or leg) that was raised by someone other then his biological father and mother. Perhaps some awkward and unusual sexual tension, or obsession between this young man and biological mother. You have the starting ingredients for King Oedipus. You might see ""Oedipus"" strike out against his surrogate parent(s) in an attempt to take over their ""kingdom"". Things will likely turn out badly for his biological father at ""Oedipus's"" direct hand. All of this eventually brings about disaster to himself and to those he loves--or not. The writer can play god. Sophocles makes his King Oedipus blind himself after the body count rises. Of course no one takes their own sight in season two, but rather some short sighted decisions by characters come back like bad karma. A potential death warrant signed by the hand of Margaret that will pit politicians against the Catholic Church and Nelson's hair trigger stunt that has him, baby abigail and her nanny living on the fringes under new names has left great openings for season 3.",5,Oedipus The King Theme Used--Genius!,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,1483,"['Versions', 'Sophocles', 'King', 'Oedipus', 'been', 'used', 'clever', 'writers', 'centuries', 'Flannery', ""O'Conner"", 'did', 'brilliant', 'spin', 'short', 'story', 'Lame', 'Shall', 'Enter', 'First', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'anyone', 'missed', 'second', 'season', 'know', 'story', 'very', 'old', 'tragedy', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'pick', 'out', 'symbols', 'early', 'EB', 'pick', 'out', 'film', 'story', 'matter', 'see', 'young', 'man', 'wounded', 'crippled', 'foot', 'leg', 'was', 'raised', 'someone', 'other', 'then', 'biological', 'father', 'mother', 'Perhaps', 'awkward', 'unusual', 'sexual', 'tension', 'obsession', 'young', 'man', 'biological', 'mother', 'have', 'starting', 'ingredients', 'King', 'Oedipus', 'might', 'see', 'Oedipus', 'strike', 'out', 'surrogate', 'parent', 's', 'attempt', 'take', 'over', 'kingdom', 'Things', 'will', 'likely', 'turn', 'out', 'badly', 'biological', 'father', 'Oedipus', 'direct', 'hand', 'eventually', 'disaster', 'not', 'writer', 'can', 'play', 'god', 'Sophocles', 'King', 'Oedipus', 'body', 'count', 'course', 'one', 'own', 'sight', 'season', 'two', 'rather', 'short', 'sighted', 'decisions', 'characters', 'come', 'back', 'bad', 'karma', 'potential', 'death', 'warrant', 'signed', 'hand', 'Margaret', 'will', 'pit', 'politicians', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Nelson', 'hair', 'trigger', 'stunt', 'baby', 'abigail', 'nanny', 'living', 'fringes', 'new', 'names', 'left', 'great', 'openings', 'season', '3']",Boardwalk Empire: Season 2

As Nucky`s world starts unraveling on all fronts, this season has many intense and memorable scenes  and interesting plot twists.  I found it to be more compelling than season one,  and season one was pretty darn good.The supporting cast is top notch (Dabney Coleman and Paz de la Huerta are superb in their respective roles), and it was  a treat to see the much underutilized William Forsythe in the role of Manny Horvitz.My favorite character was Jimmy Darmondy (Michael Pitt).  One of the most conflicted characters ever.*****One thing that strikes me as odd is the choice of theme music for this show. ""Boardwalk Empire"" is one of the most lavish productions ever broadcast on television, and from the set designs to the costumes, they obviously took great pains to stay accurate to the period.Yet I always chuckle when the show starts with that electric-guitar drenched blues/rock-style theme.  The soundtrack for the show itself is rich with period music, or at least music that seems appropriate for the era being portrayed.  The ""Boardwalk Empire"" theme music, though, seems way out of place - sounds like it was second runner up to the theme used for ""Sons of Anarchy"".",5,"Great show, but where did they get that theme music?",1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,1318,"['Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'HBO', 'period', 'drama', 'centering', 'Prohibition', 'era', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'entertain', 'whole', 'season', 'two', 'Nucky', 's', 'world', 'unraveling', 'fronts', 'season', 'many', 'intense', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'compelling', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'Paz', 'de', 'la', 'Huerta', 'are', 'superb', 'respective', 'roles', 'was', 'treat', 'see', 'much', 'underutilized', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'role', 'Manny', 'Horvitz.My', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'Jimmy', 'Darmondy', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'One', 'most', 'conflicted', 'characters', 'ever', '*****One', 'thing', 'odd', 'choice', 'theme', 'music', 'show', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'one', 'most', 'lavish', 'productions', 'ever', 'broadcast', 'television', 'set', 'costumes', 'obviously', 'took', 'great', 'pains', 'stay', 'accurate', 'period.Yet', 'always', 'chuckle', 'when', 'show', 'electric-guitar', 'drenched', 'blues/rock-style', 'theme', 'soundtrack', 'show', 'rich', 'period', 'music', 'least', 'music', 'appropriate', 'era', 'being', 'portrayed', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'theme', 'music', 'though', 'way', 'place', 'was', 'second', 'runner', 'up', 'theme', 'used', 'Sons', 'Anarchy']",Boardwalk Empire: Season 2

1492234,A3QU74B9N0830G,B005LAJ1H2,Dan Thompson,"[1, 1]","HBO continues to prove why they are the leader in original content with the sophomore season of the terrific &#34;Boardwalk Empire.&#34; While the first season focused on introducing us to the characters, hierarchy, and culture of 1920's Atlantic City, this season ups the ante for almost every character involved in the show. While Nucky Thompson (played by the brilliant Steve Buscemi) enjoys his spot atop the Atlantic City food chain, other major players in town want to see Nucky's reign of power come to an end, particularly Nucky's former enforcer and student James Darmody (played by Michael Pitt). Most of the season focuses on the power struggle between these two, the alignment of the other characters as they choose (or are forced) which side to support, and the inevitable consequences these alignments bring.As is the case in season one, the second season continues to boast powerful and award-winning performances from it's strong cast. As mentioned earlier, Buscemi is undoubtedly great as Thompson, who sees his world come crashing down yet refuses to give in. Pitt, who I felt had a smaller and softer role in the first season, really steps up his game here and gives a terrific performance. Another impressive nod has to go to Michael Shannon, whose characters deals with a lot of demons this season and must come to grips with the bad decisions he's made, all while trying to bring justice to the booze-ridden Atlantic City. I could go on about each individual member of the cast but let me suffice by saying that the entire crew is top-notch and is one of the reasons for this show's success.The Blu-ray set itself packs quite a punch; not only do you get the entire season in HD, you also get it in DVD format, AS WELL as digitally. I'm a huge fan of combo packs and digital copies but usually only see them included in movies. I was very happy to be able to add this season to my digital collection via iTunes redemption code.

1492244,A17PNW5KFXRDT3,B005LAJ1H2,fsnva,"[2, 2]","The second season of BOARDWALK EMPIRE brings back Nucky Thompson and the whole gang from Atlantic City for another epic of scheming, double dealing and cold blooded murder in Prohibition America.  Like the first season, I watched the second on DVD, taking in three episodes in one sitting and it was like plowing through multiple chapters of a good book at one time.  In the second season, BOARDWALK EMPIRE makes it clear that it is no retro version of THE SOPRANOS, but a superb saga in its own right.At the end of the first season, a group of Nucky's partners in crime, including surrogate son Jimmy Darmody and brother Eli, enter in an alliance with Dabney Coleman's nasty old Commodore in a plan to dethrone the King of Atlantic City.  This scheme becomes a reality in season two as Nucky is indicted on charges of vote fraud and is forced out of his job as Treasurer, allowing his former allies the chance to take over his vast bootlegging network in AC.But Nucky does not go down without a fight and the battle to reclaim and hold onto his empire of crime is the main story arc of the second season.  Nucky will need all of his considerable smarts and cunning to survive; and his enemies would do well to remember the old warning: when you strike at a king, you'd better kill him.  Steve Buscemi is really at the top of his game in this season, dispelling all doubts that he could not handle a lead role; his Nucky is a man who may be down, but who is never desperate, even when the Federal Prosecutor, Esther Randolph, is ready to put his common law wife, Margaret Shroeder, on the stand and implicate him in the murder of Margaret's husband.For me, the moment that defines the season comes in the finale when Nucky tells Margaret that the only thing which might convince him of God's existence is the love he feels for her and her children and the only good thing in his life is the bond of family they give him.  Buscemi delivers these lines with the utmost sincerity, but we are well aware that it is in his interest to convince Margaret to marry him so she can't be compelled to testify against him.There are various other story lines in season two, all driven by such memorable characters as Michael Pitt's Jimmy Darmody, who finds that being the big man in Atlantic City is not all it is cracked up to be; Jack Huston's disfigured WWI vet, Jimmy's loyal trigger man who can't quite leave the battlefield behind; Stephen Graham's Al Capone, Vincent Piazza's Lucky Luciano and Anatol Yusaf's Meyer Lansky: all middlemen itching to get to the top of the heap in their chosen profession.Then there is the great Michael Shannon as Federal Agent Nelson Van Alden, a man whose deep repressions finally burst to the surface, utterly shattering the facade of virtue he presents to the world.I do have some problems with the way Margaret Shroeder's part was written this season and the way Kelly McDonald was directed to portray her as a woman who feels pangs of guilt as she becomes ever more prominent and complicit in Nucky's life and crimes.  At times I just can't see why Nucky could be all head over heels over this gloomy Irish lass. McDonald has some great moments, especially in the finale, but Margaret seems utterly incapable of experiencing joy except for that fleeting moment of coitus with Owen Slater.There are a host of great supporting players, some holdovers from season one like Michael Stuhlbarg's ultra slick Arnold Rothstein; Gretchen Mol as Jimmy's mother, who loves her little boy an awful lot; Paul Sparks's Mickey Doyle and his annoying giggle; Shea Whigham's lackwit Sheriff Eli Thompson, who is no match for his brother; Michael Kenneth Williams's Chalky White, who battles the KKK while always angling to get the best deal for his people from whatever powers that might be.And then there are the new guys (and girls) in town: Charlie Cox as henchman Owen Slater, who provides Nucky with a valuable connection to the rebels in Ireland; William Forsythe as a kosher butcher in Philadelphia with a side business in bootleg whiskey; and Julianne Nicholson's Esther Randolph, the Federal Prosecutor, the one woman with power in her own right.Greg Antonacci and Dominic Chianese (Uncle Junior himself), both alumni of THE SOPRANOS, have small parts and there is a great turn by Christopher McDonald (Shooter McGavin) as Attorney General Harry Daugherty, possibly the most corrupt man to ever sit in a President's Cabinet, and that is saying something.But the great uncredited character in BOARDWALK EMPIRE is the America of 1921, vividly recreated in the clothes, the cars, the music and in the temper of the times when the old America of the 19th Century, with its agrarian values and Victorian morals were giving way to a country that had gone big city.  There were fortunes to be made and the Irish, the Italians, the Jews and the Blacks, all groups who'd long been disdained by the majority of their countrymen, were now damned and determined to get their fair share of the money any way they could. Prohibition may have been the law of the land, but there were millions who still wanted a drink and could have cared less about right or wrong.All in all, season two of BOARDWALK EMPIRE is great entertainment, a thrilling history lesson and good storytelling, all to the credit of a great cast and writer Terrance Winter.  I wouldn't be spoiling anything when I say there is a confrontation at the end of the season that is a stunner and well worth the journey to get there.",5,The second act is better than the

I was always fascinated by Atlantic City's history, especially the time of Prohibition, where gangsters smuggled illegal &#34;booze&#34; to speakeasies and to the rich who could afford the price of the very expensive alcohol...at least the real kind...not the white lightening brands.When I heard that HBO was going to roll out a new series based on Atlantic City's infamous &#34;Nucky&#34; Johnson, called &#34;Nucky Thompson&#34; in this series, I made sure I had my TV on to watch the pilot. I became a big  fan immediately after the premier's conclusion and watched the entire first season. It was obvious that HBO had a huge success on its hands.&#34;Nucky&#34; Thompson is very well portrayed by Steve Buscemi. The undisputed &#34;boss&#34; of the political machine that controlled Atlantic City and the Atlantic County government, Thompson rose to prominence as county treasurer during the 1920s and 1930s, a position which allowed him to control the county's purse strings. He was also county collector. &#34;Nucky&#34; interacts with several historical figures in both his personal and political life, including mobsters, politicians, government agents, and the common folk who looked up to him.Season Two of &#34;Boardwalk Empire&#34; is rich in characters, story telling and setting. Atlantic City of the 1920s is recreated here. Screen writer Terence Winter, (creator of &#34;The Sopranos),&#34; along with co-producer and director Martin Scorsese, seamlessly switch between the boardwalk, Chicago, Manhattan, Philadelphia and even the White House. The time, the place and the characters depend on where the action is. This series is both a crime story and a political story. The sprawling cast of characters, some real and some fictional, are fascinating, as are their lives and personal agendas. I find that as exceptional Season One is, Season Two matches it or surpasses it. While we are introduced to the cast of characters, their lives and &#34;special interests&#34; in the first season, here we see these figures vividly come to life and made more complex. The viewer is also treated to further glimpses of the looks and sounds of the 1920s-30's. The music and clothing are wonderful and very realistic, greatly enhancing the ambiance of the show.Season two begins in January 1921 and takes place between February and August 1921. There are 12 episodes. Season 1 ended on a high note for &#34;Nucky&#34; Thompson, but he is in somewhat of a of a downward spiral now as other factions vie for control of Atlantic City and a piece of the black market booze trade. Without including &#34;spoilers,&#34; this season's overall highlights include:Jimmy Darmody, (Michael Pitt), whom &#34;Nucky helped raise, is manipulated by his puppet master father, Commodore Louis Kaestner, (Dabney Coleman),  to move along with their plot to remove &#34;Nucky&#34; from power. Many from &#34;Nucky's&#34; own camp desert him in favor of this new group, including, in the ultimate of betrayals, his own brother, Eli, (Shea Whigham). The rebellion runs deep and wide. One doesn't make friends while crushing everyone in the way of extraordinary ambition. &#34;Nucky&#34; has been ruthless in maintaining control over roads, public services, politics and now the bootlegging game in Atlantic City. He has suspected a plot, especially after a Ku Klux Klan attack on Chalky White's, (Michael K. Williams), warehouse. The Commodore's faction decides to frame &#34;Nucky&#34; for election fraud, leaving him against the ropes. All his valuable contacts and connections are for naught, as they cannot help him beat these charges. While Season One was about building characters, this season seems to be about tearing them down. However, trouble for &#34;Nucky&#34; means entertainment for the audience.All the regulars return and continue with their adventures, or misadventures. Powerful crime bosses, Arnold Rothstein, (Michael Stuhlbarg), and Manny Horvitz, (William Forsythe)  are added to the cast. Frequently the female characters appear to be stronger, smarter/craftier and more subtle in the ways of manipulation than their male counterparts. They don't use guns...they use their minds. All are back this season: Margaret Thompson, (Kelly Macdonald), formerly Schroeder, n&eacute;e Rohan, is a young Irish widow and mother. She turns to Nucky for help and eventually becomes a very important figure in Thompson's life; Gillian Darmody, (Gretchen Mol), is Jimmy's mother and an old friend of Nucky's. She is beautiful, very saavy about power and runs a very classy house of &#34;ill repute.' She is also Charles &#34;Lucky&#34; Luciano's former lover; Angela Darmody, (Aleksa Palladino), is Jimmy's wife and the mother of his young son; and Lucy Danziger, (Paz de la Huerta), Nucky's is mistress and a former Ziegfeld Follies dancer. Even Eddie Cantor shows up here.A major part of the series includes the story of a twenties gang called &#34;The Combined&#34; or &#34;Big Seven Group.&#34; &#34;Boardwalk&#34; begins to incorporate these historical figures in Season Two. The biggies on the east coast are part of it and it is multicultural, as crime is. Seven different gangs: Sicilian, Italian, Jewish, and Irish come together to bring people booze during Prohibition. They also bring a little bit of smack or &#34;something in the sack.&#34; This group is the precursor to the National Crime Syndicate of the 1930s. The Big Seven icludes Charles &#34;Lucky&#34; Luciano's, (Vincent Piazza), and Meyer Lansky&#8217;s, (Anatol Yusef), operations as well as Enoch &#34;Nucky&#34; Johnson and Abner &#34;Longy&#34; Zwillman&#8217;s, (uncredited), outfits from New Jersey, Moe Dalitz, (uncredited), from Cleveland, Waxey Gordon, (Nick Sandow), and Harry &#34;Nig&#34; Rosen (uncredited), of Philadelphia, Danny Walsh, (uncredited), representative for Providence, Rhode Island. Johnny Torrio, (Greg Antonacci) is a kind of consigliere. A very young Al Capone, (Stephen Graham), is too busy dealing with the North Side Gang. However, Capone does attend the Atlantic City Conference of 1929. And Giuseppe Masseria, ( Anthony Quinn ), is best known as &#34;Joe the Boss.&#34; He is also known as &#34;the man who can dodge bullets&#34; because he survives a multi-gun execution attempt on Bowery.",5,Even better than Season One.,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,6712,"['was', 'born', 'raised', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'way', 'casinos', 'took', 'over', 'town', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'was', 'once',

In this case, Season 2 of Boardwalk Empire meets and exceeds every expectation that I would have after watching the first season. Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi) now fights for control of Atlantic City and the liquor empire. The cast of characters he has to deal with from Chalky White, to Leo Rothstein, to corrupt senators, judges, lawyers, family (his brother, Eli, to a Treasury Agent (Van Aulden) and acquaintances, it will be a huge time for Nucky Thompson and a time of danger as Prohibition ruled the nation while a nation of thirsty drinkers continue to fuel the wars over alcohol.Every episode is outstanding. I won't ""spoil"" who dies in Season 2. The reality is that a LOT of people die in Season 2 because it had to happen. The show's central theme continues to be the fact that prohibition made better mobsters than ever before and it meant that money bought anything and everything so that the alcohol would flow despite the laws against it in the early 1920s.Season 2 ends with a wild finish. Losing a character or two from Season 2 will make for an intersting third season (and hopefully further seasons after that!), but with this cast, the writing and the plot(s) I know the series is going the right direction.

1492272,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005LAJ1H2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 11]","Certainly one of the most admired shows on the 2010 television schedule, HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"" boasted the year's most impressive pedigree with Martin Scorsese taking a production credit and even directing the pilot episode (for which he won an Emmy). This brain child of Terrence Winter, a primary creative force and writer for ""The Sopranos,"" adapted the Nelson Johnson non-fiction work chronicling the sordid history of Atlantic City into a masterful blend of fact and fantasy. Embraced by mainstream critics and viewers alike, ""Boardwalk Empire"" picked up a Golden Globe for Best Dramatic Program and acting honors for lead Steve Buscemi at both the Globes and the SAG awards for its debut season. And yet, if I'm being completely honest, while I issued my highest recommendation for the artistry of Season One--it always connected more with my intellectual side, but never quite my heart. Season Two, however, became my passion in 2011. With richer characterizations, plot developments rivaling any Greek tragedy, and a stunning season capper--""Boardwalk Empire,"" in its second season, was as thrilling and riveting as any show on TV.Taking the relationships that were developed in Season One, ""Boardwalk Empire"" raised the stakes for just about everyone in these twelve episodes. I won't discuss many specifics or reveal any surprises, but the show struck gold when it turned its leads Steve Buscemi (as Atlantic City politico Nucky Thompson) and Michael Pitt (as his surrogate son and primary enforcer) from a mentor/student bond to outright rivals. Most of the episodes capitalize on this split, as major characters are forced to align themselves on one side or the other. And this power struggle brought new depth, new cunning, new betrayal, and new ambitions to the surface in a variety of ways to the principle cast. The dramatic arc of the season was bigger, more emotional, and more surprising than anything I had anticipated. There were at least three moments as the show neared its season conclusion where my jaw just dropped and I sat in stunned silence. The show was certainly true to the ruthlessness of the era and was wildly unpredictable.Buscemi, in particular, had a stellar year. As his professional world crumbled around him in light of numerous legal woes--Buscemi had a quiet intensity that was riveting to watch. You don't become boss, after all, by just giving up! Pitt, a little passive in Season One, took on a stronger role--torn between various factions, but trying to negotiate just what was right or what he could live with. Kelly Macdonald, as Nucky's main squeeze, finally had to fully accept her place in this criminal world from which she was benefiting. It was very refreshing! Gretchen Mol (as Pitt's mother, though in real life she is only 8 years his senior) broke out as a true power player and was fantastic! Shea Whigham (as Buscemi's brother) tried to emerge from Nucky's shadow in perhaps the show's most undervalued performance. And Michael Shannon (as the agent obsessed with Buscemi) continued to face the repercussions of his bad acts in Season One. Along with great supporting bits, including my favorite Dabney Coleman, the terrific Michael Kenneth Williams and scene-stealing Jack Huston, newcomers Charlie Cox and Julianne Nicholson scored big as well.There was never any doubt that ""Boardwalk Empire"" was one of the best cast and acted dramas on television. But every major character, and most minor ones as well, were given a chance to shine in a year that raised the dramatic stakes, moral compromise, and naked aggression to stunning new heights. Operatic in its grandeur, unapologetic in its viciousness--anyone that was put off by the slow build tension of Season One should appreciate how well that investment has paid off in an unforgettable second year! Serious drama for adults (and one of the most spectacular visual shows from the period recreation standpoint), ""Boardwalk Empire"" has always engaged my brain--but this year, my heart is fully along for the ride.

1492278,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B005LAJ1H2,Luke Killion,"[2, 2]","""BoardWalk Empire"" is currently one of HBO's most popular shows; the third season just premiered its first episode on Sunday, September 16th with a harder, more violent series of events that revolve around the illegal sale of alcohol during prohibition on New Year's Eve 1923 in New Jersey, New York and Chicago. It holds true to the parting words of Jimmy Darmody in Season 2, as he tells his one time mentor Nucky that ""you can't be half a gangster anymore."" As the series has progressed, it is shaping up to be the finest example of how the modern American racketeer was created. Martin Scorsese is an executive producer, and this show might rank with some of his best work, although he is not in the director's chair. Scorsese is the authority on mob stories, and his seal is definately upon ""Boardwalk Empire.""The first season opens during the start of prohibition with the Volstead Act in 1919, with this second season occuring during 1921-22. ""Boardwalk Empire"" obviously centers around the expanding beachfront resort community of Atlantic City and its County Treasurer/mob boss, Nucky Thompson (played by Steve Buscemi), who is based on one the real life politicos of New Jesey, Nucky Johnson. Season 2 has also included some of Prohibition's political figures, mainly President Warren Harding and Attorney General Harry Daugherty, who is Nucky's ""ace up the sleeve"".This series is really a unique look back at the formative age of American mobsters, done through the genre of historical fiction. Terrence Winter (also of ""The Sopranos"") has teamed up with Scorsese and Mark Wahlberg to mix actual characters from the criminal underworld who rose through the ""gangster finishing school"" that was prohibition, with fictitious figures such as Jimmy Darmody (Michael Pitt) and Prohibition Agent Nelson Van Alden. This is an interesting take on an important period in American history; the writers of the show have been able factor in the real to life stories of legendary prohibition era gangsters (Arnold Rothstein, Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky and Al Capone) with the purely invented characters that have a serious effect on historical events. This works very well because in mob folklore, there are many versions of reality, as most deals are obviously not documented, leaving the actual truth open to a degree of speculation. Jimmy Darmody features as the main fictitious persona in Seasons 1 and 2, as his ill fated family history which tied him to the highest levels of Atlantic City ultimately brought him down in a series of bad decisions, perhaps a tutelage in what not to do in that kind of situation.Season 2 was similar to most major gangster stories, in that it centers around a ""beef"", which escalates into a full scale turf war for the control of Atlantic City's alchohol supply. The principals are Nucky (Buscemi) and his volatile relationship with a man known as ""The Commodore"" (played by Dabney Coleman), who is a behind the scenes old time boss of AC with connections to all the blue bloods of New Jersey. It is revealved at the end of season 1 that Jimmy Darmody (straight off the French battlfields of WWI) is the illegitimate son of the Commodore, yet Nucky was the one who ""raised"" Jimmy. This sets the events in motion, as the viewer learns that Jimmy is a tragic figure of Greek proportions, and his plight creates the climax to Season 2.This show is also an amazing ensemble masterpiece. Michael Shannon plays an initially devout Prohibition agent (Van Alden) who allows the boardwalk to change his ways, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Kelly MacDonald plays the conflicted woman in Nucky's life, an Irish immigrant who shows an advanced intellect and develops Nucky's modernist respect for women's rights, yet appears to be a mistake because of the circumstances of their initial acquaintance. Michael Kenneth Williams (the legendary stick up kid Omar in another HBO series, ""The Wire) is the city's black boss, which gives the show alot of racial commentary, and Season 2 also has William Forsythe as a creepy Yiddish butcher from Philidelphia who has little compunction about ""slaughtering."" Charlie Cox gives Nucky his muscle and connections to a liquor supplier in Season 2 as IRA agent Owen Slater. Slater's main talent is ""making people stop"", when Nucky's brother Eli (also the AC Sheriff) becomes power hungry and furious.  Season 3 looks to be a more violent and openly aggressive, as the classic ""Chicago Beer War"" begins to unfold, with Stephen Graham's plucky version of Al Capone versus a smart mouthed Dean O'Banion and Nucky's attempt to hold his balance with the most psychotic of New York's mobsters.",5,"Epic Roaring 20's series about America's ""original gangsters""",1348099200,"09 20,

1492281,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B005LAJ1H2,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[30, 82]","Boardwalk Empire had an interesting premise and some good historical material to mine. It worked ok for the first season. But as the second season went on, it became clear that the premise had been played out. The setting and the characters had been used up. And there was nowhere to go but down.The first major problem was that the show degenerated into ""Good Irish Wife Playhouse"". This is a gangster drama. Most people (including me) want to see gangster drama rather than the overblown domestic trials and tribulations of I dont know how many ""good"" Irish wives in the cast. And because its Good Irish Wife playhouse, we have to treat the death of her wifebeating, baby-killing drunken husband Hans as great crime. Somehow nobody makes the point that killing a guy who beats his pregnant wife up in they way he did can be seen more as a sort of rough justice rather than a moral crime. I'm not sure anyone even bothers to make the point about what sort of guy Hans was.About halfway through the season, they seemed to realize that the plot had run out. So they started killing and/or wrecking every character in the cast. By the end of the season, almost everyone but Thompson (and wife) was dead. Every episode seemed to require a shocking death or a shocking betrayal that often made little sense and were worse yet, against the actual history.The real Commodore lived to 1934. Yet in the show he is killed in the early 1920s to provide more mixed up family drama leading to the death of another character. The Commodore was an important character to the show because he provided the bridge between the political machine and the business community.The show also fails to understand the rules of a 1920s political machine. Gangsters were not going to openly kill high-profile businessmen or senior politicians without consequences. Especially a low-level gangster in Atlantic City. The show also doesn't understand that the local political machine fits into a bigger state-level machine with its own priorities.The show also ignores the democratic party in terms of how things got done in that era. The democratic party (who controlled the statehouse at the time) would have been leading the charge to get members of the atlantic city machine. And the democratic machine would have existed in parallel with the republican machine. Working with gangsters in New York or other east coast cities would require political negotiations as well as negotiations with gangsters. Disputes between gangsters turn into disputes between politicians. The writers just don't understand and don't care much about how the era really worked.By the end of the second season, everyone is dead and the show seems to have nowhere left to go. Its been renewed for a third season. But what that will consist of is unclear. They can either abandon history or they can repeat themselves.Steve Buscemi does an outstanding job in the lead role. He is the only person associated with this program who deserves awards. Its just a pity that the writers are not up to creating better material for him to play.",2,a show that has outlasted its premise,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,3082,"['Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'had', 'interesting', 'premise', 'good', 'historical', 'material', 'mine', 'worked', 'ok', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'went', 'became', 'clear', 'premise', 'had', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'setting', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'up', 'was', 'nowhere', 'go', 'down.The', 'first', 'major', 'problem', 'was', 'show', 'degenerated', 'Good', 'Irish', 'Wife', 'Playhouse', 'gangster', 'drama', 'Most', 'people', 'including', 'want', 'see', 'gangster', 'drama', 'rather', 'overblown', 'domestic', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'dont', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'good', 'Irish', 'wives', 'cast', 'Good', 'Irish', 'Wife', 'playhouse', 'have', 'treat', 'death', 'wifebeating', 'baby-killing', 'drunken', 'husband', 'Hans', 'great', 'crime', 'Somehow', 'nobody', 'point', 'killing', 'guy', 'who', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'up', 'way', 'did', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'sort', 'rough', 'justice', 'rather', 'moral', 'crime', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'even', 'bothers', 'make', 'point', 'what', 'sort', 'guy', 'Hans', 'was.About', 'halfway', 'season', 'seemed', 'realize', 'plot', 'had', 'run', 'out', 'started', 'killing', 'and/or', 'wrecking', 'character', 'cast', 'end', 'season', 'almost', 'everyone', 'Thompson', 'wife', 'was', 'dead', 'episode', 'seemed', 'require', 'shocking', 'death', 'shocking', 'betrayal', 'often', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'were', 'worse', 'yet', 'actual', 'history.The', 'real', 'Commodore', 'lived', '1934', 'show', 'killed', 'early', '1920s', 'provide', 'more', 'mixed', 'family', 'drama', 'leading', 'death', 'character', 'Commodore', 'was', 'important', 'character', 'show', 'provided', 'bridge', 'political', 'machine', 'business', 'community.The', 'show', 'also', 'understand', 'rules', '1920s', 'political', 'machine', 'Gangsters', 'were', 'not', 'going', 'openly', 'kill', 'high-profile', 'businessmen', 'senior', 'politicians', 'consequences', 'Especially', 'low-level', 'gangster', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'show', 'also', ""n't"", 'understand', 'local', 'political', 'machine', 'bigger', 'state-level', 'machine', 'own', 'priorities.The', 'show', 'also', 'democratic', 'party', 'terms', 'how', 'things', 'got', 'done', 'era', 'democratic', 'party', 'who', 'controlled', 'statehouse', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'leading', 'charge', 'get', 'members', 'atlantic', 'city', 'machine', 'democratic', 'machine', 'would', 'have', 'existed', 'parallel', 'republican', 'machine', 'Working', 'gangsters', 'New', 'York', 'other', 'east', 'coast', 'cities', 'would', 'require', 'political', 'negotiations', 'as', 'well', 'negotiations', 'gangsters', 'Disputes', 'gangsters', 'turn', 'disputes', 'politicians', 'writers', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'how', 'era', 'really', 'end', 'second', 'season', 'everyone', 'dead', 'show', 'have', 'nowhere', 'left', 'go', 'been', 'renewed', 'third', 'season', 'what', 'will', 'consist', 'unclear', 'can', 'either', 'abandon', 'history', 'can', 'repeat', 'themselves.Steve', 'Buscemi', 'outstanding', 'job', 'lead', 'role', 'only', 'person', 'associated', 'program', 'who', 'awards', 'just', 'pity', 'writers', 'are', 'not', 'creating', 'better', 'material', 'play']",Boardwalk Empire: Season 2

The series and season are good, they're excellent, but I'll let others describe those. Me? I'm going to focus on the actual product here instead.This box comes with 3 Blu-Ray discs, packaged by themselves. At the price paid for it, you'd think that would be all you get, considering it's a pretty standard price. HBO goes the extra mile though, by far. This set ALSO comes with (separately packaged) 2 double sided DVD's with all 12 episodes.. But wait, THERE'S MORE!!! HBO also throws in one code that allows you to download ALL episodes, PLUS 3 special features, ALL in HD off of iTunes.I've got, in my collection, probably 30, 40 television shows, most with multiple seasons. NONE of them have given out this much for this little. I think the closest I've seen was Chuck and Grimm with Ultraviolet digital copies (which aren't horrible, but they're not iTunes), nothing at all with the amount of 'extra' release content we have here.EXCELLENT job, HBO.
