1645010,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,B00C9LNTBK,Dave,"[6, 7]","This film might have had a good plot if just a little attention was paid to details that were contradictory within the plot, script, set and filming.  For example:  At the beginning of a party that was filmed in the bright afternoon sun reference was made to the behavior of one of the attendees during the party as lasting all night.  Later, when it was still bright outside one of the attendees said it was getting late.  One character leaves the party room during the sunlight and returns several minutes later when it all of a sudden is very dark outside. There is a gunshot at one point within a room that cannot be heard.  I cannot give away a number of the other contradictions without disclosing the plot.Other than the problems with the plot, script etc., the acting was of junior high school quality.  I might not have been as annoyed with this film had the morally compromised main characters been somewhat convincing, but their ability to portray of emotion was laughable.I also suspect that the Amazon ratings were favorable influence by 5 star reviews from reviewers that had never reviewed any film or products.  I should have checked.  Do not spend time on this film unless you have some perverse need to be annoyed.",1,Terrible,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,1232,"['film', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'plot', 'just', 'little', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'details', 'were', 'contradictory', 'plot', 'script', 'set', 'filming', 'example', 'beginning', 'party', 'was', 'filmed', 'bright', 'afternoon', 'sun', 'reference', 'was', 'made', 'behavior', 'one', 'attendees', 'party', 'lasting', 'night', 'Later', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'bright', 'one', 'attendees', 'said', 'was', 'getting', 'late', 'One', 'character', 'party', 'room', 'sunlight', 'returns', 'several', 'minutes', 'later', 'when', 'sudden', 'very', 'dark', 'outside', 'gunshot', 'one', 'point', 'room', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'heard', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'number', 'other', 'contradictions', 'disclosing', 'plot.Other', 'problems', 'plot', 'script', 'etc.', 'acting', 'was', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'quality', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'annoyed', 'film', 'had', 'morally', 'compromised', 'main', 'characters', 'been', 'somewhat', 'convincing', 'ability', 'portray', 'emotion', 'was', 'laughable.I', 'also', 'suspect', 'Amazon', 'ratings', 'were', 'favorable', 'influence', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'reviewers', 'had', 'never', 'reviewed', 'film', 'products', 'should', 'have', 'checked', 'Do', 'not', 'spend', 'time', 'film', 'have', 'perverse', 'need', 'be', 'annoyed']",No One Will Know

Castillo,"[0, 0]","After reading the reviews, i was a ready for the now normal basement produced, wasted my life minutes, movie but as it got going, i found myself actually enjoying it while i was doing my housework this time. I had to leave where i was able to come back to it and it still wasnt that bad, for i was able to continue to keep up with it as i was now putting away my groceries and such. So it got 3 stars for keeping me interested while i also got a few things done around my home today too, okay?? Oh, and the ending wasn't what i thought it would be, well, not until the moment when they were playing the worse game of Charades i've ever witness?? yikes!",3,House Work Genre??,1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,652,"['reading', 'reviews', 'i', 'was', 'ready', 'now', 'normal', 'basement', 'produced', 'wasted', 'life', 'minutes', 'movie', 'got', 'going', 'i', 'found', 'actually', 'enjoying', 'i', 'was', 'doing', 'housework', 'time', 'had', 'leave', 'where', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'come', 'back', 'still', 'bad', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'continue', 'keep', 'up', 'i', 'was', 'now', 'putting', 'away', 'groceries', 'such', 'got', '3', 'stars', 'keeping', 'interested', 'i', 'also', 'got', 'few', 'things', 'done', 'home', 'today', 'too', 'Oh', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'i', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'not', 'moment', 'when', 'were', 'playing', 'worse', 'game', 'Charades', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witness', 'yikes']",No One Will Know

That was intentional, I'm sure, to set him up as a sympathetic hero of sorts. But the hodgepodge of rmiscreants is part of what worked for me. The movie kicks off well. I liked the beginning set up. Once the party gets rolling, its like a comedy of errors. How bad those two are at pulling off a crime!!! It was entertaining to see the scramble and try to clean up their blunders. And it was fun to guess at who would crack first and when. The ending kind of disappointed me, not in the sense of how it was executed but how the story wound up resolved. I would've preferred it to go in a different direction. But hey- that's OK. Its just a flick. The movie served its purpose for me: entertained me during nonprimetime viewing hours when I needed a horror flick to keep me company while I did some mindless tasks.",4,Horror Junkie's Review: 3.5 really but I'll round up,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,944,"['characters', 'here', 'ranged', 'obnoxious', 'contemptible', 'just', 'ugh', 'Excepting', 'course', 'boyfriend', 'missing', 'guest', 'was', 'intentional', ""'m"", 'sure', 'set', 'up', 'sympathetic', 'hero', 'sorts', 'hodgepodge', 'rmiscreants', 'part', 'what', 'worked', 'movie', 'off', 'well', 'liked', 'beginning', 'set', 'up', 'party', 'rolling', 'comedy', 'errors', 'How', 'bad', 'two', 'are', 'pulling', 'off', 'crime', 'was', 'entertaining', 'see', 'scramble', 'try', 'clean', 'up', 'blunders', 'was', 'fun', 'guess', 'who', 'would', 'crack', 'first', 'when', 'ending', 'kind', 'disappointed', 'not', 'sense', 'how', 'was', 'executed', 'how', 'story', 'wound', 'up', 'resolved', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'go', 'different', 'direction', 'hey-', 'OK.', 'just', 'flick', 'movie', 'served', 'purpose', 'entertained', 'nonprimetime', 'viewing', 'hours', 'when', 'needed', 'horror', 'flick', 'keep', 'company', 'did', 'mindless', 'tasks']",No One Will Know
