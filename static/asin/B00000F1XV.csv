496662,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,B00000F1XV,Bomojaz,"[4, 5]","Set in a rural Texas town near the end of WW I, the flu epidemic of that year is raging. The movie attempts to capture, in great detail, the tribulations of a family at this period of time: the war in Europe, the influenza, and their everyday routines. Death seems everywhere. A great deal of trouble went into getting the details of the setting absolutely authentic. It's a poignant movie, and we can identify and feel for the characters: the husband (William Converse-Roberts) and wife (Hallie Foote) who lose their 8-month-old child to the flu, and the 17-year-old brother (Matthew Broderick) who wants nothing but to go fight in Europe before it's all over. A very real slice of life, with few, if any, of the Hollywood conventions one might expect. Written by Horton Foote. Worth a watch.",5,Texas slice of life,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,793,"['Set', 'rural', 'Texas', 'town', 'end', 'WW', 'flu', 'epidemic', 'year', 'raging', 'movie', 'capture', 'great', 'detail', 'tribulations', 'family', 'period', 'time', 'war', 'Europe', 'influenza', 'everyday', 'routines', 'Death', 'everywhere', 'A', 'great', 'deal', 'trouble', 'went', 'getting', 'details', 'setting', 'absolutely', 'authentic', 'poignant', 'movie', 'can', 'identify', 'feel', 'characters', 'husband', 'William', 'Converse-Roberts', 'wife', 'Hallie', 'Foote', 'who', 'lose', '8-month-old', 'child', 'flu', '17-year-old', 'brother', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'who', 'nothing', 'go', 'fight', 'Europe', 'over', 'very', 'real', 'slice', 'life', 'few', 'Hollywood', 'conventions', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'Written', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'watch']",1918 [VHS]
496663,A3AAMGFK82Y15I,B00000F1XV,Denise Carter,"[28, 29]","This is such a beautiful movie, as true today as it was then.  My mother nearly died in the flu pandemic of 1918, and told me about those times in great detail.  My brother and I suffered from measles and whooping cough in the early 40s, and our house was quarantined by the city.  Being a child during WWII, I can still identify with many elements of this DVD.  Everything moved at such a leisurely pace that it must have seemed that time stood still, especially for the kids.  I remember feeling this way growing up in a small town.  If you are looking for a movie that moves at breakneck speed, then don't buy this one.  But, if you are contemplative and have many memories of the past that you wish to relive, this is the movie for you.  I intend to watch it again and again.  It is truly a story of a world that no longer exists.  That makes me sad, especially for our children.",5,A Nostalgic Trip,1095724800,"09 21, 2004",2004,883,"['such', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'true', 'today', 'was', 'then', 'mother', 'nearly', 'died', 'flu', 'pandemic', '1918', 'told', 'times', 'great', 'detail', 'brother', 'suffered', 'measles', 'whooping', 'cough', 'early', '40s', 'house', 'was', 'quarantined', 'city', 'Being', 'child', 'WWII', 'can', 'still', 'identify', 'many', 'elements', 'DVD', 'Everything', 'moved', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'time', 'stood', 'still', 'especially', 'kids', 'remember', 'feeling', 'way', 'growing', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'one', 'are', 'contemplative', 'have', 'many', 'memories', 'past', 'wish', 'relive', 'movie', 'intend', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'truly', 'story', 'world', 'no', 'longer', 'sad', 'especially', 'children']",1918 [VHS]

If you have seen ""Courtship"" and ""Valentine's Day"" you know Horace and Elizabeth, the Vaughns and the various people who live in Harrison, Texas so you must see ""1918"" to know what becomes of them.  The flu is raging through the town, the war is winding down and Brother Vaughn spends most of his time at the movies watching war pictures as he romantisizes about enlisting.
