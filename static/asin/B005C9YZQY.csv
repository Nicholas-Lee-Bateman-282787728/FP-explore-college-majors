1453597,A3R7PQAHD3NZM0,B005C9YZQY,Autumn Blues Reviews,"[6, 17]","This version of Puss 'N Boots is quite unique and this is probably the reason why it has received such bad reviews. I would say it is a film that would be more enjoyable for children above the age of 9 and also adults. Read the title people ""The True Story,"" this means it is based on the true story of the famous Puss'N Boots character by Charles Perrault. My 10 year old son, my husband and I watched it together and we all enjoyed the movie, completely. The animation was unique and so is the princess and all the characters. The princess is not your average pretty long haired blonde with gentle manners, which is what some mothers prefer their little girls to see. The princess has short dark hair, is spoiled, and can be rude at times. Yes, she has her own unique personality, unlike those fake fairy tale cartoons. Puss is quite the character, he is not your average cat and William Shatner did a fine job as Puss 'n Boots, as far as I am concerned. I found the characters to be very interesting and entertaining. A refreshing change from some of those high end cartoon films that seem to always be overly advertised. I loved the feel and look of the characters and the music and voices were unique and again entertaining. I feel people these days don't take unique art and concepts into consideration. Why can't a movie be enjoyed just for what it is? It seems everything must be a perfect fairy tale or compared to a high end film for them to enjoy a movie, which I find truly sad. I give The True Story Of Puss 'N Boots 5 stars for uniqueness, entertainment and unconventionality.",5,A unique artistic film geared more toward older children and adults.,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,1590,"['version', 'Puss', 'N', 'Boots', 'quite', 'unique', 'probably', 'reason', 'why', 'received', 'such', 'bad', 'reviews', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'children', 'age', '9', 'also', 'adults', 'Read', 'title', 'people', 'True', 'Story', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'famous', 'Puss', 'N', 'Boots', 'character', 'Charles', 'Perrault', '10', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'husband', 'watched', 'together', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'completely', 'animation', 'was', 'unique', 'so', 'princess', 'characters', 'princess', 'not', 'average', 'pretty', 'long', 'haired', 'blonde', 'gentle', 'manners', 'what', 'mothers', 'prefer', 'little', 'girls', 'see', 'princess', 'short', 'dark', 'hair', 'spoiled', 'can', 'be', 'rude', 'times', 'Yes', 'own', 'unique', 'personality', 'fake', 'fairy', 'tale', 'cartoons', 'Puss', 'quite', 'character', 'not', 'average', 'cat', 'William', 'Shatner', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'Puss', 'n', 'Boots', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'found', 'characters', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'refreshing', 'change', 'high', 'end', 'cartoon', 'films', 'seem', 'always', 'be', 'overly', 'advertised', 'loved', 'feel', 'look', 'characters', 'music', 'voices', 'were', 'unique', 'again', 'entertaining', 'feel', 'people', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'unique', 'art', 'concepts', 'consideration', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'movie', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'what', 'everything', 'must', 'be', 'perfect', 'fairy', 'tale', 'compared', 'high', 'end', 'film', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'find', 'truly', 'sad', 'give', 'True', 'Story', 'Puss', 'N', 'Boots', '5', 'stars', 'uniqueness', 'entertainment', 'unconventionality']",The True Story of Puss'n Boots

It had a lot of fun parts but a lot of parts I would not want my child to see and the voice to lips was weird too. I think this might have been a French cartoon first and then dubbed over with English.I did love the spunk of Puss `N Boots. He was just as I would have pictured him from the books I read as a child.The things I wouldn't want my child to see were parts of the princesses and how she seemed to get away with being very rude to the people who were there to help. In the end she turned out nice but I just didn't like how mean she was and I don't want my children to act like her. The queen was very creepy and would have scared/confused my children. And I didn't like the whole hidden meaning behind the boy being naked and the queen inviting him to the castle. It was all too weird and would have messed up my kids minds.Seriously, this movie was a waste of 79 minutes of my life and I'm glad to have previewed it before my children watched it.I HATE giving bad reviews but I had to be honest with this one. Not worth watching.---------------* Disclaimer / Disclosure: I received a free sample to facilitate my review.

With his cunning wit, Puss helps him win the heart of the Princess while battling devious suitors that are after the throne.To be completely honest, I bought this DVD simply because of William Shatner's participation in it. I figured, if he was involved with it, it couldn't that bad. However, I was surprised with it. Not that it was bad, it had its' good points and all but, at times, I started to wonder exactly where this movie was going. When reviewers started using creepy and strange to describe this film, they weren't very far off. I began to say that about it myself. Even though it took some time to get rollin' good, by the film's end-Puss 'n' Boots turned out to be good. I'll admit, not quite Dreamworks' Puss 'n' Boots good...but good.It's entertaining for what it is but, don't go into it looking for it to be up to Pixar or Blue Sky Studios level of CGI animation, Cuase you won't find that here. It looks like it was made back when CGI films first hit the scene. We all know it made leaps and bounds since that time.Nonetheless, I'd rate The True Story of Puss 'n' Boots okay in my opinion. If you can find it in a bargain bin somewhere for a five-spot, it's worth getting. Yet, be forewarned, it's not quite what you're expecting.

The characters are totally different.  Once you separate out the movies and characters though it makes it easier to watch the movie.This movie is just over an hour and its animation is not as cheesy as I expected.  It is a story of a man who inherits a cat who talks and wears red leather boots that he makes for him, his dad's dying request.  After falling for the princess, Puss takes matters into his own hands and helps him win over her heart.  It is a very strange story with very strange characters.  Now my 3 year old watched this and really only liked the music and there was some funny songs throughout the movie.  He wasn't scared but I could definitely see some young kids being scared of certain scenes and characters.Honestly I am indifferent to this movie.  I don't really like it but I don't hate it either.

I didn't pay close enough attention at the Redbox kiosk and thought I was getting the recent major studio release of Puss N Boots but got this instead...wonder how many other suckers like me ended up with this by mistake, poor saps.  In any case, this movie is really bad.  First, the pros: the animation is actually decent.  Uh, that's really the only pro I can think of, otherwise this thing is a mess.  The voice acting is exceedingly grating and overblown across the board, from Puss himself to the drunken queen to the villainous chamberlain - each character voiced so annoyingly that it's impossible to like any of them.  The dialog is sophomoric and often times so weird that it's hard to know what the characters are even talking about much of the time.  Really the whole thing has an exceedingly weird vibe, but not a good kind of weird, not charming-weird, or clever weird, just ""this doesn't make any sense"" weird.  My 7 year old son must have said a few dozen times during the movie, ""Dad, this is weird"" and mom and dad couldn't have agreed more.  Be aware too that many of the female characters in this G rated ""family"" film are hyper-sexualized in their appearance, wearing skin tight outfits that reveal lots of cleavage and accentuate their exaggeratedly curvy physiques.  Not the kind of thing my son & 3 year old daughter need shaping their perception of what womanhood is about.  In the end, here's the deal: the narrative is clunky and awkward, the characters are unlikeable, the dialogue is juvenile, and the overall tone is freakish.

1453603,AY3EENC2BGTGK,B005C9YZQY,"M. G. Gagliano ""Maria""","[4, 10]","The 411:This movie stars William Shatner as the voice of Puss 'N Boots.In this movie adaptation, the storyteller, explains that he witnessed a story and he has decided to tell to the young and old.  Then our story begins with the Chamberlain, Queen and Jester discussing how they must find a husband for the princess.  The princess wants a dancer and the Queen doesn't feel she needs to marry. My favorite parts of the movie starred the Queen! She is huge, lazy and uses a fly swatter to wake her husband.Next we see the princess who is dancing and singing badly and our hero Peter, whose dying father willed the family's cat to him and instructs him to make the cat, boots out of the leather in a trunk upstairs in the attic. He dies telling his son to always have trust in his cat.The princess loves dancing so much that she goes out to a tavern masked and sings with her strange back up dancers.The cat introduces Peter to the Princess and they fall in love much to the Chamberlain's dismay.While I like the graphics and think the story is OK. There were many disturbing moments. The princess's singing and dancing for one. AWFUL!  The princess and Peter talking in front of a big bed and than kissing right before the princess starts singing ""I feel pretty"" the next day. Strange message! But the worst part of the whole movie was William Shatner's voice! Ugh...never have I heard something more disturbing. When I asked my 6 year old her thoughts on the movie she said, ""I didn't like the cat's voice"". Huh, she didn't like it for the same reason and she doesn't even know who William Shatner is.The lesson behind the movie is a good one and could be lost in the translation, You don't have to be at the top of the food chain to finish first. If given the opportunity and with confidence, even a miller's son could marry a princess.If you are going to watch, watch it with an open mind. This movie stays truer to the story and is dark at times.
