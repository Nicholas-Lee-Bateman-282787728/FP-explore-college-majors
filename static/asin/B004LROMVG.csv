It looks as if they transferred it to DVD straight from VHS. Now I understand that the show was originally recorded to video and not film, and is not in HD but they could have at least enhanced the image a little bit. It's as if Nickelodeon doesn't realize what they really have with all these old shows!This DVD is actually coming from Nickelodeon so I don't think you will be able to find a better quality DVD but for all it's worth it's not that bad. it's still watchable and I still highly recommend this DVD.I was having a sense of nostalgia and was getting really tired of all this new crap that's on TV currently. So, I bought all the seasons from all the old shows I used to watch on Nick, FOX, and ABC. So far Nick is the only one totally bias of it's past.

1413496,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004LROMVG,DVD Verdict,"[20, 21]","Judge Dawn Hunt, DVD Verdict--From a time when a character still had to sheepishly confess his parents were divorced, this is a little gem of a series. While there are definite elements of slapstick, most of the time the cast manages to hold on to the edge just enough to keep from tipping over into outright silliness. As with many sitcoms, a number of the plots revolve around lying, specifically a little lie which snowballs until the characters are forced to tell the truth and then hugs are doled out.One of the things that really struck me was how the teenagers all interacted with Buddy. I was really surprised they were so patient with him, going out of their way to make sure he was listened to and included. I understand that's how it was written but it's a dynamic that's rarely present nowadays. Any show that has teenagers and middle-schoolers together more often than not has tension between those characters. Usually it's the younger kids wanting attention and the older kids not wanting to be anywhere near the brats.Another thing which stood out was the careful editing. It's like a neon sign now but back then I didn't know Brad wasn't riding that galloping horse, or Ted wasn't really in danger of being kicked by a stallion. It is very much a product of its time and I like that about it. I enjoy watching for those moments and seeing how they were made to convince an untrained eye what was occurring on screen.This series has found its way into a lot of people's hearts, and I believe one of the reasons for that is more than half of the cast never went on to do anything else. Thus, there is no getting a fix for any of the actors. They're trapped in celluloid forever for fans here but nowhere else.The only extra is an interview with series star Christine Taylor (17 min.) She goes into great detail about her experience filming the series, which was 65 episodes over two years. She was only 17 when she got the job so it was interesting to hear her perspective on how she perceived the process. Back then she was equally concerned with whether or not she was going to get to go to prom and graduate at home in Pennsylvania. A lot of what she learned about acting from the show she still carries with her. One of the most amusing elements of her interview is hearing her describe meeting Paris Hilton.Full review at dvdverdict.com",4,Big on nostalgia and fun,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,2355,"['Judge', 'Dawn', 'Hunt', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'time', 'when', 'character', 'still', 'had', 'sheepishly', 'confess', 'parents', 'were', 'divorced', 'little', 'gem', 'series', 'are', 'definite', 'elements', 'slapstick', 'most', 'time', 'cast', 'hold', 'edge', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'tipping', 'over', 'outright', 'silliness', 'many', 'sitcoms', 'number', 'plots', 'revolve', 'lying', 'specifically', 'little', 'lie', 'characters', 'are', 'forced', 'tell', 'truth', 'then', 'hugs', 'are', 'doled', 'out.One', 'things', 'really', 'struck', 'was', 'how', 'teenagers', 'interacted', 'Buddy', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'were', 'so', 'patient', 'going', 'way', 'make', 'sure', 'was', 'listened', 'included', 'understand', 'how', 'was', 'written', 'dynamic', 'rarely', 'present', 'nowadays', 'show', 'teenagers', 'middle-schoolers', 'together', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'tension', 'characters', 'younger', 'kids', 'wanting', 'attention', 'older', 'kids', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'anywhere', 'brats.Another', 'thing', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'careful', 'editing', 'neon', 'sign', 'now', 'back', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Brad', 'was', ""n't"", 'riding', 'galloping', 'horse', 'Ted', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'danger', 'being', 'kicked', 'stallion', 'very', 'much', 'product', 'time', 'like', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'moments', 'seeing', 'how', 'were', 'made', 'convince', 'untrained', 'eye', 'what', 'was', 'occurring', 'screen.This', 'series', 'found', 'way', 'lot', 'people', 'hearts', 'believe', 'one', 'reasons', 'more', 'half', 'cast', 'never', 'went', 'do', 'anything', 'else', 'Thus', 'getting', 'fix', 'actors', ""'re"", 'trapped', 'celluloid', 'forever', 'fans', 'here', 'nowhere', 'only', 'extra', 'interview', 'series', 'star', 'Christine', 'Taylor', '17', 'min', 'great', 'detail', 'experience', 'filming', 'series', 'was', '65', 'episodes', 'two', 'years', 'was', 'only', '17', 'when', 'got', 'job', 'was', 'interesting', 'hear', 'perspective', 'how', 'perceived', 'process', 'Back', 'then', 'was', 'equally', 'concerned', 'not', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'go', 'prom', 'graduate', 'home', 'Pennsylvania', 'lot', 'what', 'learned', 'acting', 'show', 'still', 'One', 'most', 'amusing', 'elements', 'interview', 'hearing', 'describe', 'meeting', 'Paris', 'Hilton.Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",Hey Dude - Season 1

I was six when it came on and the only thing I ever watched on Nickelodeon was Nick at Nite so this show was perfect for me. Mr Ernst was my favorite character. Why? I guess I'm not sure. I remember hating Brad and thinking she was very unatttactive. Boy was I wrong. Kelly Brown (Brad) is smoking hot.

Some of my favorite eps include ""Ted's Saddle"" and ""Ted and Brad Get Handcuffed"".The series includes a strong cast of characters, including David Brisbin as the NJ native turned cowboy, Mr. Ernst, David Lascher as Ted McGriff (you gotta love that name), Kelly Brown as the resident rich girl Brad, Joe Torres (who is still very much alive) as Danny and  Christine ""Marcia Marcia Marcia"" Taylor as Melody.Shout! included a brand-new interview with Christine (it's about 15 minutes in total) which was pretty interesting to watch.This is packaged in a clear plastic case, and an episode guide is included on the inlay, the discs also include a color silkscreen picture on each (see scans of everything I posted).Relive all the memories and enjoy all the hijinks in the wild west with season one of ""Hey Dude"".
