The movie is cute and funny and it also has some good music in it. Lucy Hale and Freddie Stroma did a great job playing there parts and i felt like the whole movie is great BUT, there is a couple problems I do have with this movie. The first problem is it's a cinderella story and in the cinderella tale she drops something.. and she did not drop anything in this movie that would make him find her, besides hearing her sing and that's what is ""dropped"" and the second thing is she has a stepbrother and a stepsister and it is just a little weird because i am so used to the original but i did love this movie and highly reccomend it!!",5,I loved this movie but..,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,735,"['really', 'did', 'love', 'movie', 'am', 'sure', 'anybody', 'who', 'liked', 'first', 'two', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'also', 'movie', 'cute', 'funny', 'also', 'good', 'music', 'Lucy', 'Hale', 'Freddie', 'Stroma', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'there', 'parts', 'i', 'felt', 'whole', 'movie', 'great', 'BUT', 'couple', 'problems', 'do', 'have', 'movie', 'first', 'problem', 'cinderella', 'story', 'cinderella', 'tale', 'something..', 'did', 'not', 'drop', 'anything', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'find', 'hearing', 'sing', 'what', 'dropped', 'second', 'thing', 'stepbrother', 'stepsister', 'just', 'little', 'weird', 'i', 'am', 'so', 'used', 'original', 'i', 'did', 'love', 'movie', 'highly', 'reccomend']",N/A

Yes she lives with her stepmother(Missi Pyle) and does all of the chores for her, but she still eats dinner at the table with the family and is not treaated like a slave. She is just shown no care and takes care of everything and everyone because her stepmother is a horrible mother to even her own kids and has Katie take care of them. I think Missi Pyle was a great choice for the stepmother because I find her personallity annoying yet humorous which is a perfect fit. In this show Lucy Hales character Katie has one stepsister starred by Megan Park(Secret Life of the American Teenager) who goes after the same boy as her and one stepbrother who is a troublemaker and adds lots of humor to this show.
