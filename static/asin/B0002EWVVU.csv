832396,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B0002EWVVU,Anton Ilinski,"[2, 3]","I liked ""The Eye 2"" a lot although it's a bit different in many ways. First it's not a direct sequel of ""The Eye"", but rather variations on the same theme. And though it's also made by Pang brothers it still differs. They are two absolutely distinct films and probably it would have been better to give the second part a new title. It's also different because the film seemed pretty Americanized to me. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but ""The Eye 2"" is done very professionally, very Hollywood-like hence losing much of the charm asian horror movies possess - viscosity, slow-pacing, hypnotizing atmosphere and thoughtfulness. No, don't think it totally reminds American remakes of Asian horrors, ""The Eye 2"" still has this Oriental style and a bunch of thrills everyone is expecting. It's just a little bit different, a little more polished and lustrous.Joey's (brilliant acting from a Taiwanese actress Qi Shu whom you could notice in ""The Transporter"") suicide attempt fails then she gets pregnant and starts seeing dead people. Yes, I know, that's an old story, but what matters are the details. Obviously there's some reason ghosts try to communicate with her and for hour and a half she's going to try to find out why. Surely the truth will be surprising and unsuspected.Actually the first part was scarier to my opinion (just recall the elevator scene or the calligraphy scene), but ""The Eye 2"" also manages to scare and what's important - when least expected. There were specifically two scenes that made me jump on my chair - very gruesome and extremely unexpected. There were a lot more as frightening but generally in the tradition of Asian horror films - long black hair, strange moving etc. And I have to say some of the special effects will stay with you for a long time. ""The Eye 2"" certainly deserves wide audiences - it's pretty comprehensible for people who are not very familiar with Hong Kong horror movies (I say Hong Kong for Pang brothers are Chinese albeit the movie was also shot in Thailand and Singapore) and those who are will find a lot of chills they intend to find. Only I wouldn't recommend this movie for pregnant ladies - you need to keep yourself and your baby in a good mood! And since ""The Eye 2"" deals with pregnancy - it would be better to keep away from it for a while.And speaking of Americanizing - Pang brothers have moved to Hollywood already where next year they ought to release a horror movie ""The Messengers"" and also a remake of their own ""Bangkok Dangerous"" that will be called ""Time to Kill"". Speaking frankly Hollywood killed many good directors from Europe, Asia and, say, New Zealand. I hope Pang brothers will stand and keep their style not falling into mediocrity.",4,GOOD SEQUEL AS I SEE IT,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,2722,"['liked', 'Eye', '2', 'lot', 'bit', 'different', 'many', 'ways', 'First', 'not', 'direct', 'sequel', 'Eye', 'rather', 'variations', 'same', 'theme', 'also', 'made', 'Pang', 'brothers', 'still', 'are', 'two', 'absolutely', 'distinct', 'films', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'give', 'second', 'part', 'new', 'title', 'also', 'different', 'film', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'Americanized', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'thing', 'Eye', '2', 'done', 'very', 'professionally', 'very', 'Hollywood-like', 'hence', 'losing', 'much', 'charm', 'asian', 'horror', 'movies', 'possess', 'viscosity', 'slow-pacing', 'hypnotizing', 'atmosphere', 'thoughtfulness', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'totally', 'American', 'remakes', 'Asian', 'horrors', 'Eye', '2', 'still', 'Oriental', 'style', 'bunch', 'thrills', 'everyone', 'expecting', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'little', 'more', 'polished', 'lustrous.Joey', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'Taiwanese', 'actress', 'Qi', 'Shu', 'whom', 'could', 'notice', 'Transporter', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'fails', 'then', 'pregnant', 'seeing', 'dead', 'people', 'Yes', 'know', 'old', 'story', 'what', 'matters', 'are', 'details', 'Obviously', 'reason', 'ghosts', 'try', 'communicate', 'hour', 'half', 'going', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Surely', 'truth', 'will', 'be', 'surprising', 'unsuspected.Actually', 'first', 'part', 'was', 'scarier', 'opinion', 'just', 'recall', 'elevator', 'scene', 'calligraphy', 'scene', 'Eye', '2', 'also', 'scare', 'what', 'important', 'when', 'least', 'expected', 'were', 'specifically', 'two', 'scenes', 'made', 'jump', 'chair', 'very', 'gruesome', 'extremely', 'unexpected', 'were', 'lot', 'more', 'frightening', 'generally', 'tradition', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'long', 'black', 'hair', 'strange', 'moving', 'etc', 'have', 'say', 'special', 'effects', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'Eye', '2', 'certainly', 'wide', 'audiences', 'pretty', 'comprehensible', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'familiar', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'horror', 'movies', 'say', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Pang', 'brothers', 'are', 'Chinese', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'shot', 'Thailand', 'Singapore', 'who', 'are', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'chills', 'intend', 'find', 'Only', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'pregnant', 'ladies', 'need', 'keep', 'baby', 'good', 'mood', 'Eye', '2', 'deals', 'pregnancy', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'keep', 'away', 'while.And', 'speaking', 'Americanizing', 'Pang', 'brothers', 'have', 'moved', 'Hollywood', 'already', 'where', 'next', 'year', 'ought', 'release', 'horror', 'movie', 'Messengers', 'also', 'remake', 'own', 'Bangkok', 'Dangerous', 'will', 'be', 'called', 'Time', 'Kill', 'Speaking', 'frankly', 'Hollywood', 'killed', 'many', 'good', 'directors', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'say', 'New', 'Zealand', 'hope', 'Pang', 'brothers', 'will', 'stand', 'keep', 'style', 'not', 'falling', 'mediocrity']",N/A

832398,A1ARQYFYXAL4I,B0002EWVVU,bonsai chicken,"[33, 34]","With THE EYE being among my favorite scary movies ever, I was looking forward to this film with both excitement and trepidation.  The promising side was that the Pang Brothers helmed this film as well, rather than turning it over to someone else.  But we know how sequels tend to go, especially if the original cast does not return.As it turns out, that isn't a problem, because THE EYE 2 is a sequel only in the most general sense.  It, too, concerns a woman who begins seeing ghosts.  (The literal translation of both films' original title - JIAN GUI - is ""Seeing Ghosts."")  Otherwise, this film is completely unrelated.  Joey Cheng (Shu Qi - THE TRANSPORTER, GORGEOUS) is an outwardly tough but emotionally fragile young woman who has just ended a relationship with a married man.  After a failed suicide attempt she starts to see phantoms wherever she goes -- in particular, one ghostly woman who seems to be following her around.In some ways, THE EYE 2 is a better film than its predecessor.  It's not as frightening (though it has its moments) but it strives to be something more than a straight-ahead thriller.  It's about a woman facing an unwanted, unexpected pregnancy alone.  It delves into eastern philosophy and themes of karma and reincarnation.  It's just a different movie altogether, and viewers should go in expecting that.  The distinctive style of the Pang Brothers is still ever-present.Lion's Gate has released a nice DVD package of this film.  Extras include a thirteen-minute behind-the-scenes feature which sheds light on the creators' intentions and trailers for AUDITION, INFECTION, PREMONITION, JU-ON, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS and more.  The movie looks and sounds fantastic (5.1 surround is strongly suggested if you have it available.)Since both films are independent stories, you don't need to watch them in any particular order, but both are recommended.",5,Haunted,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,1881,"['THE', 'EYE', 'being', 'favorite', 'scary', 'movies', 'ever', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'excitement', 'trepidation', 'promising', 'side', 'was', 'Pang', 'Brothers', 'helmed', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'rather', 'turning', 'someone', 'else', 'know', 'how', 'sequels', 'tend', 'go', 'especially', 'original', 'cast', 'not', 'return.As', 'out', ""n't"", 'problem', 'THE', 'EYE', '2', 'sequel', 'only', 'most', 'general', 'sense', 'too', 'woman', 'who', 'seeing', 'ghosts', 'literal', 'translation', 'films', 'original', 'title', 'JIAN', 'GUI', 'Seeing', 'Ghosts', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'Joey', 'Cheng', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'THE', 'TRANSPORTER', 'GORGEOUS', 'outwardly', 'tough', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'ended', 'relationship', 'married', 'man', 'failed', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'see', 'phantoms', 'particular', 'one', 'ghostly', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'following', 'around.In', 'ways', 'THE', 'EYE', '2', 'better', 'film', 'predecessor', 'not', 'frightening', 'moments', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'straight-ahead', 'thriller', 'woman', 'facing', 'unwanted', 'unexpected', 'pregnancy', 'alone', 'eastern', 'philosophy', 'themes', 'karma', 'reincarnation', 'just', 'different', 'movie', 'altogether', 'viewers', 'should', 'go', 'expecting', 'distinctive', 'style', 'Pang', 'Brothers', 'still', 'ever-present.Lion', 'Gate', 'released', 'nice', 'DVD', 'package', 'film', 'Extras', 'include', 'thirteen-minute', 'behind-the-scenes', 'feature', 'light', 'creators', 'intentions', 'trailers', 'AUDITION', 'INFECTION', 'PREMONITION', 'JU-ON', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'REJECTS', 'more', 'movie', 'fantastic', '5.1', 'surround', 'strongly', 'suggested', 'have', 'available', 'films', 'are', 'independent', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'watch', 'particular', 'order', 'are', 'recommended']",N/A

832400,A3VP5SXUTKJFRW,B0002EWVVU,"C. DeGhoul ""urieldewolf""","[5, 6]","Having seen and loved ""The Eye"" (which, I feel, had the single best suspense scene I have EVER seen in a horror movie... but I won't tell you which scene it is &lt;g>), I willingly took a ""chance"" with ""The Eye 2.""  The two films have a similar feel, similar styles, and a similar theme, but are different enough that you won't think you're just watching a re-hashed version of its predecessor. Even more than the first ""The Eye"", I find the second movie almost hard to classify as ""horror.""  Yes, there are some horrific scenes, startles, suspense, gore, and some disturbing images (children semi-splattered on the street, for example -- so let that be a warning to the very faint-of-heart) but the movie also has a pleasing symmetry to it and a surprisingly touching ending; traits the first movie also shared.  In fact, I was literally moved to tears at the ending.  (Mind you, I can sit through the goriest movie without batting an eye.  However, yes, I can be reduced to snivelling if a movie pulls the right heart-strings.)I mentioned ""predictable"" because the narrative actually tells you what's going on if you simply pay attention.  To me, it was clear about half-way (or a bit more) through the movie, which left me with that frustrating feeling of waiting for the character in the movie to ""catch up"" and finally ""get it.""  Mind you, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I simply don't know if it was deliberate on the part of the film-makers or not.  In other words, was the ""surprise"" spoiled for me because I figured it out in advance or was it deliberately designed so the audience was supposed to know before the main character (and thus lending to a completely different type of tension)?  Because so many clues were given outright, I must conclude that it was a deliberate decision to let the audience in on the ""secret"" in advance. Although this tactic did reduce the ""surprise"" factor, there were enough other ""ahhh!"" moments of revelation that were well played and satisfying.Unlike many Asian horror movies, I find the Pang brothers' movies much easier to follow in terms of narrative and character and thus much easier to enjoy.  You're not left scratching your head in consternation, wondering what you just saw and thinking you must have missed some subtitles because the ending made no sense and came to no conclusion.  Both ""The Eye"" movies have very clear plots, with a starting point at which the world starts to go terribly wrong, a build-up of the mystery and suspense, then a careful unfolding of the mystery in a way that is a bit like a detective story (the audience 'experiences' the exposition along with the lead character), and finally an actual conclusion that is, I feel, satisfying.Personally, I liked the original movie better but not because the second one lacked anything.  It's simply like choosing between two flavors of ice cream that you really like.  I did find the lead character of the first movie more likable and could relate to her better but that was an aspect of the character and not the acting because the acting in both movies was excellent.I hope there will be a third movie and I hope that it will be yet another delicious ""flavor"" to savor like the first two have been.(Warning: Movie is a definite R rating. No bad language, no nudity that I remember, but very adult themes (pregnancy, abortion, suicide, rape, etc.)  Blood and gore.  Some horrifying death scenes.  Not for the faint-of-heart or overly squeamish.  Nevertheless, ""The Eye"" movies are NOT Western-style slasher splatter-fests.  It doesn't flinch from gore but it also doesn't revel in it the way too many 'Western' horror movies do.)",4,Predictable yet surprising,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,3661,"['Having', 'seen', 'loved', 'Eye', 'feel', 'had', 'single', 'best', 'suspense', 'scene', 'have', 'EVER', 'seen', 'horror', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'scene', 'lt', '>', 'willingly', 'took', 'chance', 'Eye', '2', 'two', 'films', 'have', 'similar', 'feel', 'similar', 'styles', 'similar', 'theme', 'are', 'different', 'enough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'think', ""'re"", 'just', 'watching', 're-hashed', 'version', 'predecessor', 'Even', 'more', 'first', 'Eye', 'find', 'second', 'movie', 'almost', 'hard', 'classify', 'horror', 'Yes', 'are', 'horrific', 'scenes', 'startles', 'suspense', 'gore', 'disturbing', 'images', 'children', 'semi-splattered', 'street', 'example', 'so', 'let', 'be', 'warning', 'very', 'faint-of-heart', 'movie', 'also', 'pleasing', 'symmetry', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'ending', 'first', 'movie', 'also', 'shared', 'fact', 'was', 'literally', 'moved', 'tears', 'ending', 'Mind', 'can', 'sit', 'goriest', 'movie', 'batting', 'eye', 'However', 'yes', 'can', 'be', 'reduced', 'snivelling', 'movie', 'right', 'heart-strings', 'mentioned', 'predictable', 'narrative', 'actually', 'what', 'going', 'simply', 'pay', 'attention', 'was', 'clear', 'half-way', 'bit', 'more', 'movie', 'left', 'frustrating', 'feeling', 'waiting', 'character', 'movie', 'catch', 'up', 'finally', 'get', 'Mind', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'deliberate', 'part', 'film-makers', 'not', 'other', 'words', 'was', 'surprise', 'spoiled', 'figured', 'out', 'advance', 'was', 'deliberately', 'designed', 'audience', 'was', 'supposed', 'know', 'main', 'character', 'thus', 'lending', 'completely', 'different', 'type', 'tension', 'so', 'many', 'clues', 'were', 'given', 'outright', 'must', 'conclude', 'was', 'deliberate', 'decision', 'let', 'audience', 'secret', 'advance', 'tactic', 'did', 'reduce', 'surprise', 'factor', 'were', 'enough', 'other', 'ahhh', 'moments', 'revelation', 'were', 'well', 'played', 'satisfying.Unlike', 'many', 'Asian', 'horror', 'movies', 'find', 'Pang', 'brothers', 'movies', 'much', 'easier', 'follow', 'terms', 'narrative', 'character', 'thus', 'much', 'easier', 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'not', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'consternation', 'wondering', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'thinking', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'subtitles', 'ending', 'made', 'sense', 'came', 'conclusion', 'Eye', 'movies', 'have', 'very', 'clear', 'plots', 'starting', 'point', 'world', 'go', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'build-up', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'then', 'careful', 'unfolding', 'mystery', 'way', 'bit', 'detective', 'story', 'audience', ""'experiences"", 'exposition', 'lead', 'character', 'finally', 'actual', 'conclusion', 'feel', 'satisfying.Personally', 'liked', 'original', 'movie', 'better', 'not', 'second', 'one', 'lacked', 'anything', 'simply', 'like', 'choosing', 'two', 'flavors', 'ice', 'cream', 'really', 'did', 'find', 'lead', 'character', 'first', 'movie', 'more', 'likable', 'could', 'relate', 'better', 'was', 'aspect', 'character', 'not', 'acting', 'acting', 'movies', 'was', 'excellent.I', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'third', 'movie', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'yet', 'delicious', 'flavor', 'savor', 'first', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'Warning', 'Movie', 'definite', 'R', 'rating', 'bad', 'language', 'nudity', 'remember', 'very', 'adult', 'themes', 'pregnancy', 'abortion', 'suicide', 'rape', 'etc', 'Blood', 'gore', 'horrifying', 'death', 'scenes', 'Not', 'faint-of-heart', 'overly', 'squeamish', 'Nevertheless', 'Eye', 'movies', 'are', 'NOT', 'Western-style', 'slasher', 'splatter-fests', ""n't"", 'flinch', 'gore', 'also', ""n't"", 'revel', 'way', 'too', 'many', ""'Western"", 'horror', 'movies', 'do']",N/A

I've seen over 1000 horror movies and the only ones that I find scary are The Eye and Shutter (both are asian and are about ghosts)! Movies like Ringu and Ju-On are also fairly scary, but not as scary as The Eye and Shutter. I have to say that, usually, before I watch a movie that is supposed to be scary, I put myself in the mood to be scared (I just love to be scared) and it worked really well with this movie! There are a lot of unexpected scenes in The Eye 2, the sound effects are really freaky, a lot of really weird stuff happens and there are a couple of scenes with a lot of tension! Most of the scary scenes made me jump only, but there are some that made me feel pretty damn uneasy! I don't think that there's anything scarier than a good ghost movie because no one knows if ghosts exist or not and the idea that maybe they exist is scary as hell!Scarier than any American horror movies coming out these days for sure!Note: This review was written in 2007.

And it should be good that it technically isn't a sequel to the first ""Eye"" movie.But the Pang Bros don't quite catch lightning in a bottle for ""Eye 2,"" which has some wonderful horror moments and unique twists, but has a rather predictable plot and a heroine who seems pretty emotionally unstable. It's an entertaining horror flick, but it feels like it could have been more -- and the most interesting parts of it involve Buddhist theology.After a huge farewell shopping spree, Joey Cheng (Qi Shu) overdoses on pills. Why? Because her weak, guilt-ridden married lover has finally dumped her. Fortunately she's found in time, and after a stay in the hospital, she heads back to China -- where she finds that she's also pregnant. But even creepier, she's starting to see people -- and creatures -- that aren't there.But seeing them isn't everything. The ghosts are starting to interfere in others' lives -- one of them saves her from a rapist, and she sees another trying to enter the body of a newborn baby, much to her horror. The increasingly unstable Joey doesn't know how to keep the the ghosts from attacking her baby, and she'll take drastic action to keep them from succeeding...""Eye 2"" is actually more fascinating as a study of Buddhist philosophy (only touched on in the first movie) than as a horror movie. In fact, the Pang boys drop a giant hint about the ghosts' intentions early on, so expect to know what's going on long before Joey ever figures it out -- lots of karma and atonement here. This fascinating aspect almost makes up for the fact that as a horror movie, it... really isn't.Danny and Oxide Pang manage to conjure up a very creepy atmosphere at times, with traditional Korean spooks, a rape scare and a healthy dose of blood'n'gore, as well as the grey-faced dead who hang around pregnant women. Unfortunately the plot is a bit flat, without much mystery or suspense -- it's basically a series of scenes where Joey sees ghosts and acts crazily. Creepy, but rather plotless.Nor is Joey a particularly compelling character -- she seems rather unstable to start with (what with the repeated suicide attempts and adulterous affairs), although she's a bit more likable by the finale. And Qi Shu does a decent job with her, almost overacting but usually staying behind the line, even when she's screaming about ghosts under the table or freaking out when she sees mysterious creatures.""The Eye 2"" suffers from a slack middle section, but the beginning and ending (and some of the ghost scenes) are wonderful and quite creepy.

A distressing pregnancy and a complicated relationship(s) make up the bulk of this drama/mystery.  I must confess I don't know why it's called The Eye 2; the first movie has no bearing on this follow-up.  This movie stands apart and can be viewed on its own.  It does, however, bring up that pesky question again, is this a horror movie or just an intense drama involving ghosts?  I'm more inclined to call it a supernatural drama; there are no frightening elements at work.  It could even be called a (one) character study.  The entire piece is driven forward by the sheer force of Shu Qi's stunning performance.  The fact that ghosts infrequently appear throughout the story does make it eerie at times but not what I'd call a full out fright-fest.  Instead, the Pang Brothers have delivered a poignant study in bad choices and not a little interference from the nether world.  This movie is intriguing, gripping, and at times agonizing to watch.

832410,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B0002EWVVU,Ernest Jagger,"[5, 6]","My review of ""THE EYE 2,"" refers to the Region 4 import from Cinema East. While I believe that the first of ""THE EYE"" trilogy films from the Pang Brothers was great, this one is a let down. It felt more like a TV DRAMA which incorporated a few scare scenes in the film. Everything which made the first film great is missing from this one: The nuance of horror, and the suggestion of terror. If you are looking for a film that moves along similar lines as this film, I would suggest the film ""INNER SENSES"" which was the last film by Leslie Cheung, prior to his suicide in 2003. That is a great film, and highly recommended. The narrative for me in this film did not flow as smoothly as the first film. And while it is difficult to carry this through with a follow up film, and I also realize that this film is NOT a sequel, it still left me empty and wanting.Sure, there is the occasional scene or two that were a bit unsettling. But this does not make up for the film as a whole. Moreover, even though it is not a sequel to the first film, I believe that this film never measured up as a good horror film to begin with. [Very few ever do]. And part of this had to do with the fright aspect of the film. What frightens you? What is it about a horror film that unsettles you while you watch it? Hopefully not the gore? And certainly not the scenes that jump right out at you? If so, then maybe this film is for you. For me, it is the subtle nuance of horror, and more importantly, the suggestion of horror. The way a films narrative explores an area that triggers your brain with a fright that is unsettling. Something that puts you on the edge of your seat. That element of horror you never see coming---and then the film hooks you right in. This usually occurs in the beginning of a horror film, and then carries on to the middle and then surprising you in the ending. This film had none of these elements.The film itself centers on a pregnant woman named Joey (Shu Qi). After attempting suicide, she begins to see ghosts. Later she goes to a Buddhist monk who tells her that she is seeing these ghosts due to Karma. Moreover, he tells her that two experiences lead one to see the spirit world. The birth of a child, and more importantly, if a person has a  near death experience. Since she survived her suicide, and was near death, she tries to rid herself of these ghosts--or ghost. She has an ex-lover named Sam (Tik Jesadaporn Pholdee) who has a strong connection to what Joey is now going through. And I do not wish to spoil this for you. There are better Asian horror films out there. And while this one is better than a lot I have seen, it's still not that good. I would recommend that you rent the DVD prior to buying the film. It appears a lot of people like this film. Therefore, I recommend it with caution, and advise viewers to rent it first [Stars: 2.5]",2,Somewhat Of A Letdown: Will Appeal To Some,1192579200,"10 17, 2007",2007,2868,"['review', 'THE', 'EYE', '2', 'refers', 'Region', '4', 'import', 'Cinema', 'East', 'believe', 'first', 'EYE', 'trilogy', 'films', 'Pang', 'Brothers', 'was', 'great', 'one', 'let', 'down', 'felt', 'more', 'TV', 'DRAMA', 'incorporated', 'few', 'scare', 'scenes', 'film', 'Everything', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'great', 'missing', 'one', 'nuance', 'horror', 'suggestion', 'terror', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'along', 'similar', 'lines', 'film', 'would', 'suggest', 'film', 'INNER', 'SENSES', 'was', 'last', 'film', 'Leslie', 'Cheung', 'prior', 'suicide', '2003', 'great', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended', 'narrative', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'as', 'smoothly', 'first', 'film', 'difficult', 'carry', 'follow', 'up', 'film', 'also', 'realize', 'film', 'NOT', 'sequel', 'still', 'left', 'empty', 'wanting.Sure', 'occasional', 'scene', 'two', 'were', 'bit', 'unsettling', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'whole', 'Moreover', 'even', 'not', 'sequel', 'first', 'film', 'believe', 'film', 'never', 'measured', 'up', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'begin', '[', 'Very', 'few', 'ever', 'do', ']', 'part', 'had', 'do', 'fright', 'aspect', 'film', 'What', 'What', 'horror', 'film', 'watch', 'Hopefully', 'not', 'gore', 'certainly', 'not', 'scenes', 'jump', 'right', 'out', 'so', 'then', 'maybe', 'film', 'subtle', 'nuance', 'horror', 'more', 'importantly', 'suggestion', 'horror', 'way', 'films', 'narrative', 'explores', 'area', 'brain', 'fright', 'unsettling', 'Something', 'edge', 'seat', 'element', 'horror', 'never', 'see', 'coming', '-and', 'then', 'film', 'hooks', 'right', 'usually', 'beginning', 'horror', 'film', 'then', 'middle', 'then', 'surprising', 'ending', 'film', 'had', 'none', 'elements.The', 'film', 'centers', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'named', 'Joey', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'attempting', 'suicide', 'see', 'ghosts', 'Later', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'who', 'seeing', 'ghosts', 'due', 'Karma', 'Moreover', 'two', 'experiences', 'lead', 'one', 'see', 'spirit', 'world', 'birth', 'child', 'more', 'importantly', 'person', 'near', 'death', 'experience', 'survived', 'suicide', 'was', 'death', 'rid', 'herself', 'ghosts', 'ghost', 'ex-lover', 'named', 'Sam', 'Tik', 'Jesadaporn', 'Pholdee', 'who', 'strong', 'connection', 'what', 'Joey', 'now', 'going', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'spoil', 'are', 'better', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'one', 'better', 'lot', 'have', 'seen', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'would', 'recommend', 'rent', 'DVD', 'prior', 'buying', 'film', 'lot', 'people', 'film', 'Therefore', 'recommend', 'caution', 'advise', 'viewers', 'rent', 'first', 'Stars', '2.5', ']']",N/A

In this film, Shu Qi  is a jilted woman who attempts suicide -- an act which opens the door to another world and allows the inhabitants of that other world to become visible to her.  One might think ""shades of The Sixth Sense"" but not really.  Remember, this is a Korean film and the characters are complexly drawn and each character is uniquely tied to the other.  I wish I could ellaborate but I don't want to give the plot away.  I will say that Shu Qi's character has what she believes to be a ghost nemesis.  But at the end of the movie, in a very poignant scene, she realizes her nemesis is in as much pain as she herself is.  I own this movie, have watched it numerous times and I always cry during this scene.Eugenia Yuan doesn't say much in the movie but when she does speak her acting skill is so strong I believe even the most hard hearted person might find it hard not to blink back a tear or two.  Eugenia Yuan is not a well known actress in America but she has been nominated for many film awards -- and for good reason.  In my opinion, she is one of the best actresses ever.There are some disturbing scenes and blood in this movie but it is by no means a gorefest.

832418,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0002EWVVU,Lee Armstrong,"[16, 20]","Directed by the Pang Brothers, ""The Eye 2"" is a gripping Asian film.  It has a bit more substance than a strict horror genre.  Some of that is due to the excellent performance of Shu Qi who was riveting in ""The Transporter"" with Jason Statham and also in ""Millennium Mambo.""  As Joey Cheng, she plays an emotionally traumatized woman whose relationship is breaking up.  We see her try to choose between a dark green or light green tie for her boyfriend, go on a wild shopping spree, and then intentionally overdose on sleeping pills.  Her attempted suicide combined with her pregnancy give her access to other-worldly visions of ghosts.  Her boyfriend Sam played by Thai actor Jesdaporn Pholdee is apparently torn between two women.  His wife played by Eugenia Yuan became so stressed when she learns that he has a mistress that she threw herself in front of a train.  Joey encounters the ghost in a train station and tries to prevent her suicide, not realizing that she is now able to see the dead.  Joey sees the woman haunting her and stalking her unborn baby.  The film is punctuated by otherworldly scenes of ghosts swimming through air trying to enter the womb of pregnant women with one in a stalled elevator being particularly scary.  The film seems like it might end about 4 times, but each time the screen goes to black and the film keeps coming back.  Joey's final tragic leap scene makes one believe that there must be such a thing as soft concrete.  ""The Eye 2"" has its share of scares, but also has excellent character development from the three lead actors and an excellent expansion mechanism like a psychic mystery story in its screenplay.

Other than by the theme that it is through our eyes that we meet the dead, of course.Joey (Qi Shu) is a young woman who, in the face of a failed romance, falls apart emotionally.  An attempt at suicide has the unexpected side effect of allowing her to see the ghostly figures of spirits in the world around her.  When Joey discovers that she is pregnant by the lover who abandoned her, the second piece of the puzzle falls into place, these spirits are the dead, waiting to enter the bodies of infants as they are born.Joey is terrified, and defensive of her own unborn child.  Even the efforts of a Buddhist priest fail to convince her that this is anything but is a hideous, unexpected curse.  She keeps searching for answers, but finds no comfort in her discoveries.  She is confronted by an ironic twist of fate that will come very near destroying her completely.The Pang brothers manage to avoid the various clich&eacute;s of ghost stories, making the various spirit appearances blend right into the steadily rising tension of the film.  Qi Shu manages to stay just on this side of over acting, and the general atmosphere of the film is naturalistic.  This lack of theatricality adds unexpected reality to Qi Shu's performance, and enhances the anguish and confusion of supporting cast members like Jesdaporn Pholdee.

Whoever decided to market this as a sequel, however, really messed up. Taken as a film independent of its far superior older brother, this might well have been a lot better received than it ultimately was. This is not to say there's nothing other than marketing wrong with it, but that would have gone a long way towards making it a better experience.The plot: Joey (Millennium Mambo beauty Shu Qi) is pregnant by her former boyfriend, and doesn't know what to do about it. She attempts suicide and, after failing, she begins to see ghosts. These ghosts seem to have a thing for hanging around pregnant women...It's not a bad little story, for what it is, and the ending (which you can probably see coming a mile away) is positively heartwarming, if you're into that sort of thing. The problem is that what could have been an interesting drama with some supernatural aspects (see, for example, the fantastic The Uninvited) is relentlessly approached as a horror film, complete with utterly gratuitous shock scenes, that are way out of kilter with the basic storyline. When I have to bend my mind in directions it doesn't normally stretch to figure out how a scene fits into an otherwise straightforward movie, I'm working too hard to be enjoying it.It doesn't bear comparison with the original film, but the movie's connections opened the door when they decided to make it a sequel. Simply put, aside from the remarkable directorial powers of Oxide and Danny, which infuse the film with the usual ambiance one finds in a Pang movie, nothing about this movie is remotely in the same realm of excellence found throughout The Eye. The acting (with the exception of Shu Qi's) is pedestrian, the script is lackluster if sporadically inspired, the special effects are, well, often just there for the sake of having special effects. Not to deny some of the are pretty cool, but why are some of them there?Worth seeing if you've nothing better to do, but you're better off renting the original and watching it again. ** ",3,Pang Bros' non-sequel doesn't hold up.,1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,2139,"['Eye', '2', 'Oxide', 'Danny', 'Pang', '2004', 'Pang', 'Brothers', 'return', 'what', 'ostensibly', 'sequel', 'breakout', 'hit', 'Eye', 'decided', 'market', 'sequel', 'however', 'really', 'messed', 'up', 'Taken', 'film', 'independent', 'far', 'superior', 'older', 'brother', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'received', 'ultimately', 'was', 'not', 'say', 'nothing', 'other', 'marketing', 'wrong', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'better', 'experience.The', 'plot', 'Joey', 'Millennium', 'Mambo', 'beauty', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'pregnant', 'former', 'boyfriend', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'suicide', 'failing', 'see', 'ghosts', 'ghosts', 'seem', 'have', 'thing', 'hanging', 'around', 'pregnant', 'women', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'story', 'what', 'ending', 'can', 'probably', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'positively', 'heartwarming', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing', 'problem', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'drama', 'supernatural', 'aspects', 'see', 'example', 'fantastic', 'Uninvited', 'relentlessly', 'approached', 'horror', 'film', 'complete', 'utterly', 'gratuitous', 'shock', 'scenes', 'are', 'way', 'kilter', 'basic', 'storyline', 'When', 'have', 'bend', 'mind', 'directions', ""n't"", 'normally', 'stretch', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'scene', 'otherwise', 'straightforward', 'movie', ""'m"", 'working', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'enjoying', 'it.It', ""n't"", 'bear', 'comparison', 'original', 'film', 'movie', 'connections', 'opened', 'door', 'when', 'decided', 'make', 'sequel', 'Simply', 'put', 'aside', 'remarkable', 'directorial', 'powers', 'Oxide', 'Danny', 'infuse', 'film', 'usual', 'ambiance', 'one', 'Pang', 'movie', 'nothing', 'movie', 'remotely', 'same', 'realm', 'excellence', 'found', 'Eye', 'acting', 'exception', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'pedestrian', 'script', 'lackluster', 'sporadically', 'inspired', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'well', 'often', 'just', 'sake', 'having', 'special', 'effects', 'Not', 'deny', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'why', 'are', 'seeing', ""'ve"", 'nothing', 'better', 'do', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'renting', 'original', 'watching', 'again', '**']",N/A

I am not a fan of gore or senseless violence, so for those like me, I am writing this review. First of all, the bloodiest scene that comes to mind was the scene where the potential rapist (it didn't happen) has a bandage around his head when he walks into the hospital. (Frankly, I think he got off easy, and they didn't even show what happened to him.) You can see a little bit of blood oozing through the bandage. The scene with the train hitting the kid, as I think someone mentioned on here, was really quick, like BOOM and then scene change. I'm sorry that I can't tell you more about the movie, because I watched it in Korean(?) and I do not understand Korean. However, as far as body language goes, it is universal, so I think I got the gist of the movie. It was a lot less gorey than the Grudge, so if you made it through that movie, you should be fine.I didn't like this movie as well as The Eye, just because I felt like it was playing on the same theme without as much logic involved. My favorite scene in The Eye 2 is with the woman from the lamaze class, who was crying and the ghost man sitting near her, whom only the lead character could see.",3,better than some tv shows,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,1242,"['seeing', 'reviews', 'blood', 'gore', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'gore', 'senseless', 'violence', 'so', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'First', 'all', 'bloodiest', 'scene', 'mind', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'potential', 'rapist', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'bandage', 'head', 'when', 'hospital', 'Frankly', 'think', 'got', 'off', 'easy', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'what', 'happened', 'can', 'see', 'little', 'bit', 'blood', 'oozing', 'bandage', 'scene', 'train', 'hitting', 'kid', 'think', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'here', 'was', 'really', 'quick', 'BOOM', 'then', 'scene', 'change', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'more', 'movie', 'watched', 'Korean', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'Korean', 'However', 'as', 'far', 'body', 'language', 'universal', 'think', 'got', 'gist', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'less', 'gorey', 'Grudge', 'so', 'made', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'fine.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Eye', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'playing', 'same', 'theme', 'as', 'much', 'logic', 'involved', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Eye', '2', 'woman', 'lamaze', 'class', 'who', 'was', 'crying', 'ghost', 'man', 'sitting', 'whom', 'only', 'lead', 'character', 'could', 'see']",N/A

832428,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002EWVVU,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","`The Eye 2' is not a direct sequel to `The Eye,' but shares the same theme with it. It features lovely Qi Shu (`Transporter') as Joey, who suddenly acquires a novel ability to see things that are not actually there. Unlike the first film, in which corneous transplant gives the heroine to see the dead people, Joey gains the new power after her attempted suicide in a hotel room in Thailand.Back in Hong Kong, Joey realizes two things; one is that she is pregnant, and the other is that she has gained a special power that is not exactly a welcome thing in her life. Joey learns that these two factors are apparently related to each other, as they are revealed in the last 30 minutes that go on like endless.[WEAKER STORY] Though the two `Eye's share the same theme, the newer one lacks a strong story that supported the first. In fact, after giving a few initial scares in the first 30 minutes, in which Joey finds that she is seeing ghosts, the film can offer not many things, scare or otherwise, except several intriguing concepts that come from the Buddhism. The ideas introduced here are all interesting, but the directors Pang Brothers stretch them too much, and the film often looks repetitious, sometimes with the lingering shots on the tormented heroine.Actually, Qi Shu is required to weep, cry and scream so much, like Dakota Fanning in `War of the Worlds.' Her agonized acting, good and convincing as it is, is often painful to see with tears and even gores on her face and body. Curiously the directors seem unaware that such a mentally unstable person like Joey who gets involved in so many bizarre cases within 8 months clearly needs someone she can talk to. But the film does not provide enough supporting characters. Jesdaporn Pholdee (`The Iron Ladies'), Eugenia Yuan (`Memoirs of a Geisha') and Philip Kwok (`Tomorrow Never Dies') appear as supporting players, and Eugenia Yuan gives a very impressive performance in brief time allotted to her, but the thin storyline gives little room for them to show what they can really do.After all `Eye 2' is all about Joey or Qi Shu who plays her, and what she experiences is certainly extraordinary, especially in the final chapter where she virtually undergoes something like exquisite torture. Certainly the Qu Shu here is not Qu Shu you can see elsewhere, but the film's scares are mostly clich&#65533;d ones, and the pregnancy theme often sounds irrelevant or worse, illogical. Mildly diverting, but nothing more.",3,"""I Can See Dead People"" ...

832432,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B0002EWVVU,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[1, 2]","The Eye 2 is a very unique and creepy thriller without the usual ingredients used in the mainstream horror landscapes. It's more interesting because the heroine has to encounter evil ghosts during the months of her pregnancy. It's about karma and reincarnation of the living and the ""homeless"" ghosts. Shu Qi is brilliant in this film, because she anchors the film with a heavy-duty performance that required her to display a great deal of emotional/physical pain, anger, and fear of a single pregnant woman in a horrible circumstance.Joey(Shu Qi) is impregnanted by a married man whom she had just ended a relationship with and after her suicide attempt, she started to see creepy ghostly images in her sight. Initially, she had no idea why there was a vengeful-looking female ghost visiting, but she eventually investigated and learned that they both had been involved with the same man. During the various stages of her pregnancy, she can see things only some pregnant women can. For instance, she can see a ghost entering into the the womb of an unsuspecting pregnant woman. The image was so eerie and creepy looking, and it shocks her to see that even evil ghosts can intrude into a soul-less feutus. She eventually figured out that the ghost of her ex-lover's wife wanted to get even by possessing her soul-vacant baby, and can she prevent this from happening....The theme of this film actually makes sense to me since I have done some reading on spirituality. I'd learned from Sylvia Browne's books and CDs how spirits enter the womb at various stages and why there's miscarriage and so on. I think this film is not as scarry as the prequel, but it's got a good story and provides a very creepy mood. It's much better than most of the ghost movies in HK these days.",4,Single Chinese Pregnant Woman Surrounded By Ghosts.,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,1772,"['Eye', '2', 'very', 'unique', 'creepy', 'thriller', 'usual', 'ingredients', 'used', 'mainstream', 'horror', 'more', 'interesting', 'heroine', 'encounter', 'evil', 'ghosts', 'months', 'pregnancy', 'karma', 'reincarnation', 'living', 'homeless', 'ghosts', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'brilliant', 'film', 'film', 'heavy-duty', 'performance', 'required', 'display', 'great', 'deal', 'emotional/physical', 'pain', 'anger', 'fear', 'single', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'horrible', 'circumstance.Joey', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'impregnanted', 'married', 'man', 'whom', 'had', 'just', 'ended', 'relationship', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'started', 'see', 'creepy', 'ghostly', 'images', 'sight', 'Initially', 'had', 'idea', 'why', 'was', 'vengeful-looking', 'female', 'ghost', 'visiting', 'eventually', 'investigated', 'learned', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'same', 'man', 'various', 'stages', 'pregnancy', 'can', 'see', 'things', 'only', 'pregnant', 'women', 'can', 'instance', 'can', 'see', 'ghost', 'entering', 'womb', 'unsuspecting', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'image', 'was', 'so', 'eerie', 'creepy', 'looking', 'see', 'even', 'evil', 'ghosts', 'can', 'intrude', 'soul-less', 'feutus', 'eventually', 'figured', 'out', 'ghost', 'ex-lover', 'wife', 'wanted', 'get', 'even', 'possessing', 'soul-vacant', 'baby', 'can', 'prevent', 'happening', '.The', 'theme', 'film', 'actually', 'sense', 'have', 'done', 'reading', 'spirituality', ""'d"", 'learned', 'Sylvia', 'Browne', 'books', 'CDs', 'how', 'spirits', 'enter', 'womb', 'various', 'stages', 'why', 'miscarriage', 'so', 'think', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'scarry', 'prequel', 'got', 'good', 'story', 'very', 'creepy', 'mood', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'ghost', 'movies', 'HK', 'days']",N/A
