Would be good for people with injuries or need a very slow pace to learn and do. The weight-loss one is actually pretty good. Seems to be more in the 90s and the woman is better and you can actually work out more at a better pace. The tone one is good too made more in the 90s as well she actually is talking and doing the exercises at the same time so more like being at a class. Warning for it though there some mat workouts you can do but others require equipment like weights, ring, large ball, and weighted ball. Overall ok for the money.",3,The covers are misleading. They were made in the 80s to 90s . But some of it is good.,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,671,"['Planned', 'returning', 'look', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'made', '80s', 'woman', 'pretty', 'dull', 'boring', 'annoying', 'Would', 'be', 'good', 'people', 'injuries', 'need', 'very', 'slow', 'pace', 'learn', 'do', 'weight-loss', 'one', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'Seems', 'be', 'more', '90s', 'woman', 'better', 'can', 'actually', 'work', 'out', 'more', 'better', 'pace', 'tone', 'one', 'good', 'too', 'made', 'more', '90s', 'as', 'well', 'actually', 'talking', 'doing', 'exercises', 'same', 'time', 'so', 'more', 'being', 'class', 'Warning', 'mat', 'can', 'do', 'others', 'require', 'equipment', 'weights', 'ring', 'large', 'ball', 'weighted', 'ball', 'Overall', 'ok', 'money']",Pilates For Beginners & Beyond Boxed Set: (Pilates for Inflexible People / Pilates Complete for Weight Loss / Pilates Complete Sculpt and Tone)
1382327,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0041UUNU2,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[3, 3]","This DVD set is a re-release of three older DVDs.  For the price, you get a HUGE amount of variety.  However, the quality of the routines varies.  I have summarized each DVD below.Pilates Complete for Inflexible PeopleThis DVD was released in 2005; the instructor is Maggie Rhoades, and she teaches via voiceover.  There are over 20 routines of varying lengths (e.g., 20 minutes, 30 minutes, or 1 hour).  However, the exercises may seem somewhat repetitive, and Rhoades moves quite slowly, even for beginners.Pilates Complete for Weight LossThis DVD, released in 2004, features Karen Garcia, again teaching in voiceover.  Here there are different models displaying different levels of routines, either Beginning, Intermediate, or Advanced.  Again, the practices are various lengths (from about 15 to 45 minutes) and focus on various parts of the body.  There are also tutorials breaking down the moves.  This is probably my favorite DVD of the set.Pilates Sculpt and ToneThis DVD with instructor Meaghan White is from 2005.  The most important thing to know about the routines here--again, there are over 20--is that they require a variety of equipment, including a Pilates ring, a stability ball, a small weighted ball, and dumbbells.  This is great if you are ready to add a little variety to your Pilates routine, but others may be disappointed if they don't own these items.  In addition to being categorized by equipment, the segments are also organized by being either under or over 15 minutes.  White instructs via voiceover, and there is a bit of a cheerleader feel about her.Again, if you are looking for a wide variety of Pilates workouts, this is probably the best deal that you are going to find, but keep in mind that some of these routines might be hit or miss.",4,Nice variety of routines for the price,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,1775,"['DVD', 'set', 're-release', 'three', 'older', 'DVDs', 'price', 'get', 'HUGE', 'amount', 'variety', 'However', 'quality', 'routines', 'varies', 'have', 'summarized', 'DVD', 'Complete', 'Inflexible', 'PeopleThis', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', '2005', 'instructor', 'Maggie', 'Rhoades', 'voiceover', 'are', '20', 'routines', 'varying', 'lengths', 'e.g.', '20', 'minutes', '30', 'minutes', '1', 'hour', 'However', 'exercises', 'may', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'repetitive', 'Rhoades', 'quite', 'slowly', 'even', 'beginners.Pilates', 'Complete', 'Weight', 'LossThis', 'DVD', 'released', '2004', 'Karen', 'Garcia', 'again', 'teaching', 'voiceover', 'Here', 'are', 'different', 'models', 'displaying', 'different', 'levels', 'routines', 'either', 'Beginning', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced', 'Again', 'practices', 'are', 'various', 'lengths', 'about', '15', '45', 'minutes', 'focus', 'various', 'parts', 'body', 'are', 'also', 'tutorials', 'breaking', 'down', 'moves', 'probably', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'set.Pilates', 'Sculpt', 'ToneThis', 'DVD', 'instructor', 'Meaghan', 'White', '2005', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'know', 'routines', 'here', 'again', 'are', '20', 'require', 'variety', 'equipment', 'including', 'Pilates', 'ring', 'stability', 'ball', 'small', 'weighted', 'ball', 'dumbbells', 'great', 'are', 'ready', 'add', 'little', 'variety', 'Pilates', 'routine', 'others', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'items', 'addition', 'being', 'categorized', 'equipment', 'segments', 'are', 'also', 'organized', 'being', '15', 'minutes', 'White', 'voiceover', 'bit', 'cheerleader', 'feel', 'her.Again', 'are', 'looking', 'wide', 'variety', 'Pilates', 'workouts', 'probably', 'best', 'deal', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'keep', 'mind', 'routines', 'might', 'be', 'hit', 'miss']",Pilates For Beginners & Beyond Boxed Set: (Pilates for Inflexible People / Pilates Complete for Weight Loss / Pilates Complete Sculpt and Tone)
