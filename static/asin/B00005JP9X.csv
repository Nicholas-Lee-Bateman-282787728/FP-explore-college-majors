It's been a long time since we've seen a disutopian novel put on the screen.  'Children of Men' takes place in 2026, not too far in the future.  The planet has become infertile, and baby Diego, the youngest member of the planet has been killed in a terrorist attack in London.  Theo Farran (Clive Owen) is caught between the polarities of that world:  There's the military arm of the government, keeping immigrants in the equivalent of concentration camps.  Then, there's the underground resistance.  Theo's a pedestrian.  He cares about keeping as much stability in the chaos and out of as much trouble as possible.  His love interest is for Jillian who's a part of that underground, and his friend, Jasper (Michael Caine), is an elderly hippie who lives out in the country and maintains a mild mannered, but mature dissenter.  As an insider, Theo has what the resistance needs, a program to support their cause.  They give him an offer he can't refuse.  More interesting is someone under their wings, a Fuji woman who is pregnant and in hiding.  Theo has mission impossible, he must, significantly enough, evade both the police state and the rebel radicals while bringing the woman and her baby to safety.Messages galore come out from the movie.  The infertility part is certainly extrapolation, but little else is.  (Merely blowing up tendencies of today is an essential ingredient of science fiction, however.)  The mounting of counter-terrorism in a war at civilization's footstep doesn't try to bring the future too many leaps forward.  The composite picture is an ominous urban nightmare with dilapidated buildings, broken glass, and villains with submachine guns everywhere.  While I think 'Children of Men' is a good diversion from the usual movie fare, I sometimes thought as skillfully as the battle scenes are delivered, and the speeches are being made, that maybe the dialogue and a greater variety of developments would have made it a better picture.  Still, I must concede the movie still haunted me long after I left the theatre.",3,Exile on Planet Earth,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,2121,"['3', '1/2', '*', 'How', 'refreshing', 'get', 'nightmare', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'been', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'disutopian', 'novel', 'put', 'screen', ""'Children"", 'Men', 'place', '2026', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'future', 'planet', 'become', 'infertile', 'baby', 'Diego', 'youngest', 'member', 'planet', 'been', 'killed', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'London', 'Theo', 'Farran', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'caught', 'polarities', 'world', 'military', 'arm', 'government', 'keeping', 'immigrants', 'equivalent', 'concentration', 'camps', 'Then', 'underground', 'resistance', 'Theo', 'pedestrian', 'about', 'keeping', 'much', 'stability', 'chaos', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'trouble', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'Jillian', 'who', 'part', 'underground', 'friend', 'Jasper', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'elderly', 'hippie', 'who', 'out', 'country', 'mild', 'mannered', 'mature', 'dissenter', 'insider', 'Theo', 'what', 'resistance', 'needs', 'program', 'support', 'cause', 'give', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'More', 'interesting', 'someone', 'wings', 'Fuji', 'woman', 'who', 'pregnant', 'hiding', 'Theo', 'mission', 'impossible', 'must', 'significantly', 'enough', 'evade', 'police', 'state', 'rebel', 'radicals', 'bringing', 'woman', 'baby', 'safety.Messages', 'galore', 'come', 'out', 'movie', 'infertility', 'part', 'certainly', 'extrapolation', 'little', 'else', 'Merely', 'blowing', 'up', 'tendencies', 'today', 'essential', 'ingredient', 'science', 'fiction', 'however', 'mounting', 'counter-terrorism', 'war', 'civilization', 'footstep', ""n't"", 'try', 'bring', 'future', 'too', 'many', 'leaps', 'forward', 'composite', 'picture', 'ominous', 'urban', 'nightmare', 'dilapidated', 'buildings', 'broken', 'glass', 'villains', 'submachine', 'guns', 'everywhere', 'think', ""'Children"", 'Men', 'good', 'diversion', 'usual', 'movie', 'fare', 'sometimes', 'thought', 'as', 'skillfully', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'delivered', 'speeches', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'maybe', 'dialogue', 'greater', 'variety', 'developments', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'picture', 'Still', 'must', 'concede', 'movie', 'still', 'haunted', 'long', 'left', 'theatre']",N/A

Maybe too many pages have come and gone since last reading this tale, but the movie, supposedly based on Ms. James novel, didn't strike me as anything like the book.  Basically, even when the characters are somewhat cleaned up and dressed nice, it is dark and dingy.  The fact that the whole of the west is sterile, is basically used as backdrop by the writer/director Alfonso Cuaron.  Maybe because the director is from Mexico he felt compelled to use the movie as allegory for United States political and global policy, though the movie is based in the United Kingdom.  Did the director ever stop to think that without immigration, because of the continual over promoting of birth control, consumerism, and socialistic secularism, most countries in Western Europe would cease to exist?  Maybe this is the plague of sterilization P D James alluded to in her novel?  But you wouldn't know it by this awful movie.  The movie trys and sell us on the idea that the UK becomes insular and is either killing or deporting all immigrants.  Again, the whole idea of Ms. James book, no children moves out of the forefront in this movie.  The movie is absurd.  All one need do is read books like Londonistan by Melanie Phillips or The Last Days of Europe by Walter Lacquer to see how stupid this movie really is.  I mean these are not new ideas.  The 1930s writer and British Parlimentarian, Hilaire Belloc, predicated the end of Anglo Saxon Britain and Christian Europe due to unbridled Islamization.  As for the acting, Clive Owen is his usual dark, inward doting self.  Julian Moore gets killed.  (She should have passed on this movie.)  And Michael Caine as the 70 some year old hippie just looks goofy and awkward in his role.  The cinematography is jumpy and comes at you in snippets.  Enough already with that cliched approach.  If I have to say anything positive about the film, it is the music composed by John Tavener.  Oh and before I forget, if you dare look at the ""extras"" on this DVD you will be intellectually assaulted by the usual Brit Ivory Tower types and the cinematographer going on and on about overpopulation (by the way, all the people currently living in the world standing side by side would fit in the state of Texas) and global warming (this is interesting as right now Britain and the US is seeing the coldest winter in 25 years.)  Of course if you are an actor, film maker or ivory tower type your attitude about poor people in poor countries, as you jet around the world, is there are too many of them and just enough of me.  In the end there is nothing worse than a bad film on DVD that is preachy to boot.

The movie is so well done with documentary style camera work, long takes, and superb special effects that blend into the film. I'm still trying to figure out how they did some of the things in the film, although some are easier to figure out, but that's not the point.Clive Owen has to be the best actor I've seen in a long time. His face a maze of emotion playing everything from a pacifist to someone who finally finds a cause. Playing grief and joy so realisticially, it's stunning! The rest of the cast blends perfectly with Michael Caine having my other favorite role.There is an overall politcal message to the film which is that when a crisis develops of this scale (manmade or natural disaster) governments - legitimate, democratic ones - usually respond to the fear that the situations create more than anything else and that makes them respond harsh and wrong. Any other political discussion about the film will give things away, and I don't want to do that know, do I? :)It's easily one of the best films I've seen in a very long time.",5,"Dark, Brutal, Hopeful!",1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,1168,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'have', 'say', 'caught', 'more', 'subtleties', 'time', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'style', 'camera', 'work', 'long', 'superb', 'special', 'effects', 'blend', 'film', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'did', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'easier', 'figure', 'out', 'not', 'point.Clive', 'Owen', 'be', 'best', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'face', 'maze', 'emotion', 'playing', 'everything', 'pacifist', 'someone', 'who', 'finally', 'cause', 'Playing', 'grief', 'joy', 'so', 'realisticially', 'stunning', 'rest', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'having', 'other', 'favorite', 'overall', 'politcal', 'message', 'film', 'when', 'crisis', 'develops', 'scale', 'manmade', 'natural', 'disaster', 'governments', 'legitimate', 'democratic', 'ones', 'usually', 'respond', 'fear', 'situations', 'create', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'respond', 'harsh', 'wrong', 'other', 'political', 'discussion', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'things', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'know', 'do', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time']",N/A

646622,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B00005JP9X,ajsteele,"[1, 5]","I will start by saying a British film has a different way of approaching the filming process. I believe you have to have that knowledge and perspective when watching this. That being said , it doesnt excuse the laboring scenes that attempt artistic looks. The beginning has a somewhat convoluted feel that prevents the viewer from fully understanding the main charactor(and for that matter the supposed futuristic era). I think the surroundings to create the year 2027 were weak. Their seemed a concerted effort to not go overboard. As far as the pace, I'm not the average ""Blockbuster"" viewer, and it was slow. I personally love most films taking place in England or with a British slant but I can see how this film saturated the beginning with boredom.The concept is great. No more human births  and saving a beyond rare newborn has great appeal. Too many unnecessary scenes though that Clive Owens charactor seemed to be walking through. A real stretch(and yawn). Towards the later middle of the film it takes off. This is not simply because of the action picking up, but because you could more clearly see a bigger storyline coming together. The filming is brilliant as the interaction of unique charactors brings realism. Pure excitement abounds as bullets fly through the twisted rubble and you root for the near impossible. Again, brilliant filming. So much dragging in the beginning forced a simple ending. The end is where the expanding needed to be, with depth. Im not a strict thrill seeker only, and love heart felt and intricate scenes, but the start to middle was a little too big for itself. The movie is saved by some of the most harrowing rescue and action scenes I've ever seen. The standard dvd picture is decent but not outstanding. I cant comment on the HD DVD yet.

""Lost Inner Space""","[2, 7]","After reading many of the reviews on this site I can't help but think that there are some people out there who are in denial about what is really happening with our world.  It seems that when it comes to Art that provokes thought, there is always a vocal minority that would have it labelled as ""rubbish"".Not that this movie represents what is happening on Earth and in the World, but it does beg the question: Who are the people of the World and who are the people of the Earth? Sounds redundant, but there really is a difference between people of the World and people of the Earth. Are they mutually exclusive of each other? They seem to be at odds. Can they co-exist? This is not only a great film, but a very important film. This is the kind of film that should be studied in Film Schools. It is an attempt at highlighting current events, as opposed to covering them up with technological gatchetry and tired Sci-Fi set designs.The film works on many levels. It is allegorical, spiritual, political, melodramatic, comedic, and ironic. It's not really Sci-Fi. It's disguised as such. Some of the best Science Fiction is really hyper-Realism. Children of Men can be typified as Hyper-Realist, or multi-realist, or poly-realist. Examples of this genre can be seen in movies such as Crash and Babel.Children of Men is not Blade Runner. It is part Blade Runner, part Brave New World, part War movie, but mostly it is a sad and beautiful fable with a desperate message of Hope. But it is a Hope that is not tied to any of our so-called traditions, or systems. It is a free-floating Hope, much like the boat at the end with Tomorrow written on it. The message seems to be that we must all begin to recover our sense of connectedness with each other as physical beings and not as members of some exclusive club that will somehow outlive everyone else.This movie has a dystopian facade, and has been done over and over again, but underneath its symbolism one can barely see the outline of a different take on Utopia.",5,Dystopia NOW!

646624,A3GI6DS6I474K8,B00005JP9X,"Alan Draven ""Dark Fiction Author""","[2, 3]","Based on the novel by P.D. James. In the year 2027, humanity has become infertile and the youngest person on earth is 18 years old. An ex-activist named Theo (Clive Owen) is kidnapped one day by a rebel group led by his ex-girlfriend Julian (Julianne Moore). Theo will learn that a refugee woman is 8 months pregnant. She is the first woman in 18 years to be pregnant. The group needs Theo's help to bring the woman safely to a secret group called the Human Project. In order to get to them, they have to reach a boat, the Tomorrow, while it passes at specific scheduled stops. Betrayal, death, and hope will fill their journey to a better and fertile future.The story of Children of Men takes place in a frightening landscape of fear, propaganda, ravaged cities, and urban warfare. Alfonso Cuaron (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Y Tu Mama Tambien) masterfully directs this post-apocalyptic thriller. The filters he uses set the tone for this cold and dark film. Stunning cinematography conveys the bleak picture and desperate ways of the times ahead. The sudden bursts of action and violence pull you right in the middle of this intense story. Owen gives a near perfect performance, playing the role of Theo with just the right amount of disillusionment, sorrow, humor, and charm. Julianne Moore's appearance was brief but strong. Michael Caine provides the much needed comic relief of the film as Theo's old friend. The brilliant screenplay always kept its focus and never fell heavily into the political aspect of things (which could've dragged the movie down) and keeps a steady pace of action, surprises, and character development.Children of Men is at once a sad and beautiful film. It shows you what humanity is willing (or unwilling) to do when it finds itself doomed. Mankind's demise doesn't come as a cataclysm that wipes out the planet, but more as a slow killer in the form of the inability for humans to reproduce themselves and insure their lineage with future generations.

Clive Owen is captivating as a man caught between his sorrow from his past and the hope for a new world future.The basic premise is set in the year 2027 and 18 years ago women mysteriously stopped being capable of having children.  Society has started to crumble because all hope of the future has disappeared.Owen's character (Theo), an ex-activist, is pulled into an underground ""terrorist"" group that has found something that will bring hope to the world; but hidden agendas and distrust are threatening to pull the only hope left apart.The cinematography and set designs are top notch, and with a supporting cast that includes Michael Caine and Julianne Moore- it only takes a great story to that next level of excellence.Also the soundtrack is really well chosen and they use the music to great effect in some scenes; for example King Crimson's ""court of the crimson king"" is especially effective.Highly recommended.January 5th.I thought I would add that I just saw the movie for the second time today.  The visual poetry and thought provoking ideas have stayed quite strong in my mind since I last saw it in October.  The second time around the movie stirred up just as many thoughts and emotions as the first.As some of the other reviewers has mentioned this is a very real feeling science fiction. The problems of tomorrow in this film seem to align itself with many of the issues that we are burying ourselves in today like our growing dependency on chemicals (many with unknown side effects), or the waste that we put in our environment, and last and certainly paramount, the decreasing faith we have of anything beyond our sciences in which we measure reason, and rely upon.Children Of Men has become one of my favorite movies.

It's very intense and thought-provoking.*Camera style, even though is free-handed, is still very smooth and slick (meaning that it doesn't shake around too much).*Many action scenes use very long cuts, showing off the actors' and director's mastery in timing, acting, and details.  The logistics of these scenes are complex, so it is very impressive.*The film's color greatly adds to the dismal atmosphere.*Strong ethnic influences literally teleport the viewer into a unique setting.  To me, the British refugee camp resembles the streets of Iraq (thus making it relevant to today's current events).*Some scenes stick out vividly in my head (in particular, the ending scene where everybody stops fighting and bows down to the newborn baby...).*What few special effects the film has are very effective.  I couldn't even tell that it had any.*The characters are fairly well developed.  Their deaths are quite tragic.*Good sound and music design.*Good production design.The Bad Things*Some people may find the violence and brutality a bit much.  Overall, it is a bleak film.*They never did explain how people became infertile (then again, I think it's a minor point).*Didn't really want certain characters to die...*Not sure how close it is to the original novel.This is one of the only few movies that makes me feel depressed (second only to ""The Passion"").  Aside from the intense brutal violence, the film serves as a shadowy mirror to modern-day society.  It effectively portrays rampant terrorism, human cruelty, and injustices of worldly powers.  The filming of it is excellent in its own right, with slick camera work and very complex action scenes.  But it is not like a typical sci-fi blockbuster; it's focus is more on artistery, thought-provoking ideas, and emotional impact.

Britain alone stands tall as the last beacon of civilization. The movie co-opts the book's science fiction premise (humanity has lost the ability to procreate) and spins it as an anti-fascist fairytale about illegal immigration and border control. The central conflict in the movie has more to do with immigrants seeking shelter in Britain, rather than the child (the first in almost 20 years!) conceived and carried by one of the central characters. It certainly doesn't help matters that the woman carrying the child isn't a very compelling character, and that the most intriguing characters are killed pretty regularly throughout the film.If I hadn't read P.D. James's novel beforehand, would I have had a different opinion of the movie? Perhaps--the dystopian world created by the filmmaker is beautifully filmed, and the acting (esp. Michael Caine in a scene-stealing role) is top-notch. On its own, it might have worked for me. As an adaptation, though, the movie feels like a wasted opportunity to bring an excellent novel to life.

646635,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B00005JP9X,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[8, 11]","When going to see Children of Men, I had little to low opinion upon it.  The trailers did not at all do this justice, painting it instead as some sort of typical dystopian sci-fi action thriller with lots of chase scenes and explosions.What I got instead was not only brilliantly acted, but incredibly gritty and realistic, and save for the light leap of faith required in believing that all people would become infertile within 20 years, completely realistic.Clive Owen (Theo) is absolutely perfect as the 40-something man who sneaks scotch into his coffee and carries it around all day, uses Baby Diego's death (youngest person on earth, 18) as an excuse to skip work and hang out with his buddy Jasper (Michael Caine), and has virtually nothing left to live for after his daughter's death and his divorce, who gradually becomes a man with a purpose to get Kee (the pregnant girl) to Africa, where the Human Project awaits her.The scenes which show the dystopian future are elegantly done to show just how far society has fallen as infertility rose among the world, without lingering too much or being overly brutal on the senses.  Seeing rioters hurl stones at a moving train Theo is in, or a bomb go off in a London coffee shop is so unthinkable in this day and age and yet shot so realistically it's almost as if watching it through a documentary camera.It's interesting and somewhat disturbing to see the way immigrants to Britain are treated, strikingly similar to the way of Jews in Nazi Germany, and yet with the same tone and anti-immigrant sentiment in the country as modern-day United States, as when Theo and the others sneak into a refugee camp, Kee's friend is brutalized by the British guards for not following orders fast enough, and taken outside with a burlap sack put over her head.The last scene in the movie, the battle sequence in an immigrant camp building, shot all in one take, is the most powerful scene of the whole movie, and I had tears in my eyes watching it, just seeing the reactions of the people on screen, and the emotional power and brilliance of the scene.  The cinematrography, the sound, the picture, the acting, everything was just perfect.All in all, Children of Men was in my opinion the best movie of all in 2006, and it's a shame it didn't win any awards of importance.",5,"The greatest, grittiest, realest, and most heart-wrenching movie I've seen all year",1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,2314,"['When', 'going', 'see', 'Children', 'Men', 'had', 'little', 'low', 'opinion', 'trailers', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'painting', 'instead', 'sort', 'typical', 'dystopian', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'thriller', 'lots', 'chase', 'scenes', 'explosions.What', 'got', 'instead', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'incredibly', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'save', 'light', 'leap', 'faith', 'required', 'believing', 'people', 'would', 'become', 'infertile', '20', 'years', 'completely', 'realistic.Clive', 'Owen', 'Theo', 'absolutely', 'perfect', '40-something', 'man', 'who', 'scotch', 'coffee', 'day', 'Baby', 'Diego', 'death', 'youngest', 'person', 'earth', '18', 'excuse', 'skip', 'work', 'hang', 'out', 'buddy', 'Jasper', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'left', 'live', 'daughter', 'death', 'divorce', 'who', 'gradually', 'man', 'purpose', 'get', 'Kee', 'pregnant', 'girl', 'Africa', 'where', 'Human', 'Project', 'her.The', 'scenes', 'show', 'dystopian', 'future', 'are', 'elegantly', 'done', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'society', 'fallen', 'infertility', 'rose', 'world', 'lingering', 'too', 'much', 'being', 'overly', 'brutal', 'senses', 'Seeing', 'rioters', 'hurl', 'stones', 'moving', 'train', 'Theo', 'bomb', 'go', 'off', 'London', 'coffee', 'shop', 'so', 'unthinkable', 'day', 'age', 'yet', 'shot', 'so', 'realistically', 'almost', 'watching', 'documentary', 'camera.It', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'see', 'way', 'immigrants', 'Britain', 'are', 'treated', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'way', 'Jews', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'yet', 'same', 'tone', 'anti-immigrant', 'sentiment', 'country', 'modern-day', 'United', 'States', 'when', 'Theo', 'others', 'sneak', 'refugee', 'camp', 'Kee', 'friend', 'brutalized', 'British', 'guards', 'not', 'following', 'orders', 'fast', 'enough', 'taken', 'outside', 'burlap', 'sack', 'put', 'over', 'head.The', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'battle', 'sequence', 'immigrant', 'camp', 'building', 'shot', 'one', 'take', 'most', 'powerful', 'scene', 'whole', 'movie', 'had', 'tears', 'eyes', 'watching', 'just', 'seeing', 'reactions', 'people', 'screen', 'emotional', 'power', 'brilliance', 'scene', 'cinematrography', 'sound', 'picture', 'acting', 'everything', 'was', 'just', 'perfect.All', 'Children', 'Men', 'was', 'opinion', 'best', 'movie', '2006', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'importance']",N/A
646636,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JP9X,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","`Children of Men' is one of those rare `important' films, one everyone needs to see.  It's heartbreaking, eye opening and most of all heartwarming with its depictions of hope shining forth from the bitterness of the present.  In `Children of Men' we encounter a torn London, savaged and broken down with despair and hopelessness.  The world has collapsed in the few short years following the infertility epidemic and now, resting in the year 2027, all seems to be lost.  The film does a brilliant job of capturing the feeling of hopelessness and apathetic attitude that forms in the hearts of earths residents.There is no reason to care anymore because humans in general have no future.This is where we meet Theo Faron.  Theo's life is all but dead to him.  Clive Owen masterfully displays the utter desperation that plagues this mans soul.  We can read this across the crevasses of his face, the saddened expression in his eyes, the downward slant of his brow and then sulk in his step.  Even his words struggle to find themselves as he speaks to others in attempts at communication.  This is the first thing that I noticed about Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece.  Clive Owens performance beautifully compliments the ravaged setting he inhabits.Theo finds himself kidnapped and violently escorted to a secret meeting with his ex-wife Julian, the leader of a rebel activist group.  She is requesting his assistance in transporting a young woman, a refugee who has a secret, a very important secret.  He soon finds out what that secret is when he meets young Kee, a Fiji born woman who is, believe it or not, pregnant.  Thus begins a harrowing journey to transport Kee to meet up with `The Human Project', an organization willing to help her.  Theo meets much opposition along the way, some expected, some not, but the journey is worth any cost.Alfonso Cuaron was unfairly snubbed a directing nomination last year.  He brilliantly crafted this film so that the audience can take this journey alongside Theo and Kee, feeling every emotion and even stirring some new ones in the pit of our souls.  The film is expertly executed and completely absorbing to watch.  The sets are so real, so authentic, so engrossing that I could feel the concrete floor against my feet and breathe in the thick air.  The cinematography is orgasmic and it's an utter shame that it lost the much deserved Oscar.  As the camera swept through each scene I found myself inching closer to the screen to take it all in.  The sound editing, the visual effects, everything about this film is effortlessly maneuvered to linger in the minds of the audience.`Children of Men' is ultimately a film of hope and survival.  It wisely establishes a bleak reality before coming forth with glimmers of a better tomorrow (in fact the boat Kee is trying to reach is rightfully named `Tomorrow').  It cements itself in the hearts of the audience so much so that it draws on raw emotions.  There are moments that brought me to tears especially as the film comes to its climax.  Being a new parent I was moved deeply by this film, a film that proved what we all know, that children are our future, our only future and without them life is not worth living.",5,Proves that hope shines forth even in the most tragic of situations...,1193788800,"10 31, 2007",2007,3206,"['Children', 'Men', 'one', 'rare', 'important', 'films', 'one', 'everyone', 'see', 'heartbreaking', 'eye', 'opening', 'most', 'heartwarming', 'depictions', 'hope', 'shining', 'forth', 'bitterness', 'present', 'Children', 'Men', 'encounter', 'torn', 'London', 'savaged', 'broken', 'down', 'despair', 'hopelessness', 'world', 'collapsed', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'following', 'infertility', 'epidemic', 'now', 'resting', 'year', '2027', 'be', 'lost', 'film', 'brilliant', 'job', 'capturing', 'feeling', 'hopelessness', 'apathetic', 'attitude', 'hearts', 'earths', 'reason', 'care', 'anymore', 'humans', 'general', 'have', 'future.This', 'where', 'meet', 'Theo', 'Faron', 'Theo', 'life', 'dead', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'masterfully', 'utter', 'desperation', 'mans', 'soul', 'can', 'read', 'crevasses', 'face', 'saddened', 'expression', 'eyes', 'downward', 'slant', 'brow', 'then', 'sulk', 'step', 'Even', 'words', 'struggle', 'find', 'others', 'attempts', 'communication', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'masterpiece', 'Clive', 'Owens', 'performance', 'beautifully', 'ravaged', 'setting', 'kidnapped', 'violently', 'escorted', 'secret', 'meeting', 'ex-wife', 'Julian', 'leader', 'rebel', 'activist', 'group', 'requesting', 'assistance', 'transporting', 'young', 'woman', 'refugee', 'who', 'secret', 'very', 'important', 'secret', 'soon', 'out', 'what', 'secret', 'when', 'young', 'Kee', 'Fiji', 'born', 'woman', 'who', 'believe', 'not', 'pregnant', 'Thus', 'harrowing', 'journey', 'transport', 'Kee', 'meet', 'up', 'Human', 'Project', 'organization', 'willing', 'help', 'Theo', 'much', 'opposition', 'way', 'expected', 'not', 'journey', 'worth', 'cost.Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'was', 'unfairly', 'snubbed', 'directing', 'nomination', 'last', 'year', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'film', 'so', 'audience', 'can', 'take', 'journey', 'alongside', 'Theo', 'Kee', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'even', 'stirring', 'new', 'ones', 'pit', 'souls', 'film', 'expertly', 'executed', 'completely', 'absorbing', 'watch', 'sets', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'authentic', 'so', 'engrossing', 'could', 'feel', 'concrete', 'floor', 'feet', 'breathe', 'thick', 'air', 'cinematography', 'orgasmic', 'utter', 'shame', 'lost', 'much', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'camera', 'swept', 'scene', 'found', 'inching', 'closer', 'screen', 'take', 'sound', 'editing', 'visual', 'effects', 'everything', 'film', 'effortlessly', 'maneuvered', 'linger', 'minds', 'audience.', 'Children', 'Men', 'ultimately', 'film', 'hope', 'survival', 'wisely', 'bleak', 'reality', 'coming', 'forth', 'glimmers', 'better', 'tomorrow', 'fact', 'boat', 'Kee', 'trying', 'reach', 'rightfully', 'named', 'Tomorrow', 'hearts', 'audience', 'so', 'much', 'raw', 'emotions', 'are', 'moments', 'brought', 'tears', 'especially', 'film', 'climax', 'Being', 'new', 'parent', 'was', 'moved', 'deeply', 'film', 'film', 'proved', 'what', 'know', 'children', 'are', 'future', 'only', 'future', 'life', 'not', 'worth', 'living']",N/A

The last child to be born was 18 years earlier and no one knows why women can no longer conceive, thus the human race is on the brink of extinction through natural attrition.Theo (Clive Owen) is hired to escort an illegal to England's coast. Against all odds, the African-born Kee (Clare-Hope Ashtey) is eight-months pregnant, which makes her the hope of our entire planet. There are some who wish to exploit Kee and others want her dead. Theo and a handful of friends, including eccentric hippe  Jasper (Michael Caine) and Theo's ex, Julian (Julianne Moore), are her only chance for escape and safety.Once the pursuit begins you will witness things you've never seen before, including one inspiring moment in the midst of total chaotic war.WHAT a movie!

It's probably one of the best dystopian films ever made, and I suspect it will be long remembered as a classic of the genre.The movie is fairly loosely based on a book by P.D. James, about a world in which women have gone sterile.  I liked it much better than the book which like many science fiction books by non-genre, slumming authors was only partially successful.  But the movie works on several levels.  It's a believable, chillingly detailed study of a society just a few years removed from our own that's coming apart. It's so realistic it has an almost documentary feel to it.  For example, when the youngest person in the world, an 18 years old boy from Argentina, is assassinated, the ridiculously over the top public grieving resembles the similar public outpouring of grief whenever there's a public tragedy today.  It's a world that's similar to ours, except that it's a shabbier and dirtier and even less civil.  The movie is  also the story of a man finding purpose in a world without much of a future.  It's also an exploration of how different people learn to cope with an utterly unprecedented situation.  There's a lot of death in the movie, and every time someone died, I could only think that this world has gotten a little emptier because there wouldn't be anyone to replace that person.The immediacy of the action scenes in the movie is remarkable.  It quite literally puts you in the middle of a civil war.  There's a very memorable scene late in the movie when the soldiers on either side of the battle become aware that there's a young woman with a baby present.  The acting is excellent, particularly Clive Owen as the numbed hero and Michael Caine as an aging hippie who provides comic relief and pathos.The extras were pretty sparse for a movie of this quality, with just a very few deleted scenes included.  I found the film's ending ambivalent at best, and I would love to know what the director had in mind, but there's no commentary here.

646643,AY5ALNAA118ZL,B00005JP9X,"A. Shane ""dresh""","[1, 1]","A song kept playing in my head while I watched Children Of Men: David Bowie's Five Years. You know the one? It's the first track off the Ziggy Stardust album and it's about the release of the news that the human race was dying off. No nuclear war, no asteroids, no alien invasions... just a prosaic, species-wide extinction and what it means psychologically to one man.This, in a nutshell, is the setting of Alfonso Cuaron's unsettling satire/drama/sci-fi/action movie. But unlike the Bowie song, the human race in Children Of Men has more that just five years left; just the rest of their lives.  See, the human species has suddenly and mysteriously become infertile; the last child was born 18 years ago. And since then, everything's gone to hell.  Crime, terrorism, violence, and state repression have spun completely out of control to create a world that's totally realistic, completely plausible, and.... exactly like our own. And this may be the films biggest flaw. The world really has gone to hell and everything in Children Of Men is so current that from a sci-fi perspective, it's like shooting fish in a barrel. On top of that it's relentless pessimism just doesn't overpower its bleak worldview; which is probably why it didn't do much business or see any love on Oscar nigh. It's a very good film that never quite transcends it's own vision.Yet, I'll still put Children Of Men among the top of the films of '07 (I didn't catch it until `07). Cuaron has crafted a movie that's joyously in love with the art of the movies, that weaving an incredibly depressing story that's essentially about hopelessness. Scenes are laid out in long, meticulously choreographed takes that draw you into the action and the characters. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who's inspired tricks allow much of the techniques to be so effective, must be given much credit here. Yet the look of the film is anything but slick and `beautiful', it's rough and drab (which is probably why Lubezki failed to win the Oscar he so deserved). Overall though, Children Of Men is a work of a confident director who understands how to grab the audience and control their emotions with perfect efficiency.The central character arc is powerful and Clive Owen is awesome as a man who's almost dead on the inside. It's one of the films best elements to watch him come back to life as the story progresses. One of my favorite moments:  Owen's Theo, who's been walking around in a half-drunken daze for the first few minutes of the film, just survived a terrible tragedy and stumbles alone into the woods. He fumbles for a cigarette and then collapses with loss, horror and a shadow of joy that he's still capable of any emotion. It's a great scene and a truly great lead performance in a very difficult role; Theo is a character who internalizes everything. He's not showy, and Owen pulls it off in a way that would make Bogart proud. I mention Bogart because Children Of Men has a classic quality; and a quiet sadness that you used to see in Hollywood films of the `40s and `50s like The Setup and Out Of The Past.  I just don't know if its `currency' and bleakness will help it stand the test of time.",5,Dark Visions Of A Near Future,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,3174,"['song', 'kept', 'playing', 'head', 'watched', 'Children', 'Men', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Five', 'Years', 'know', 'one', 'first', 'track', 'Ziggy', 'Stardust', 'album', 'release', 'news', 'human', 'race', 'was', 'dying', 'off', 'nuclear', 'war', 'asteroids', 'alien', 'invasions', 'just', 'prosaic', 'species-wide', 'extinction', 'what', 'psychologically', 'one', 'man.This', 'nutshell', 'setting', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'unsettling', 'satire/drama/sci-fi/action', 'movie', 'Bowie', 'song', 'human', 'race', 'Children', 'Men', 'more', 'just', 'five', 'years', 'left', 'just', 'rest', 'lives', 'See', 'human', 'species', 'suddenly', 'mysteriously', 'become', 'infertile', 'last', 'child', 'was', 'born', '18', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'everything', 'gone', 'hell', 'Crime', 'terrorism', 'violence', 'state', 'repression', 'have', 'spun', 'completely', 'control', 'create', 'world', 'totally', 'realistic', 'completely', 'plausible', 'exactly', 'own', 'may', 'be', 'films', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'world', 'really', 'gone', 'hell', 'everything', 'Children', 'Men', 'so', 'current', 'sci-fi', 'perspective', 'shooting', 'fish', 'barrel', 'top', 'relentless', 'pessimism', 'just', ""n't"", 'overpower', 'bleak', 'worldview', 'probably', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'business', 'see', 'love', 'Oscar', 'nigh', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'own', 'vision.Yet', ""'ll"", 'still', 'put', 'Children', 'Men', 'top', 'films', ""'07"", 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', '07', 'Cuaron', 'crafted', 'movie', 'joyously', 'love', 'art', 'movies', 'weaving', 'incredibly', 'depressing', 'story', 'essentially', 'about', 'hopelessness', 'Scenes', 'are', 'laid', 'out', 'long', 'meticulously', 'choreographed', 'draw', 'action', 'characters', 'Cinematographer', 'Emmanuel', 'Lubezki', 'who', 'inspired', 'tricks', 'allow', 'much', 'techniques', 'be', 'so', 'effective', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'much', 'credit', 'here', 'look', 'film', 'anything', 'slick', 'beautiful', 'rough', 'drab', 'probably', 'why', 'Lubezki', 'failed', 'win', 'Oscar', 'so', 'deserved', 'Overall', 'Children', 'Men', 'work', 'confident', 'director', 'who', 'how', 'grab', 'audience', 'control', 'emotions', 'perfect', 'efficiency.The', 'central', 'character', 'arc', 'powerful', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'awesome', 'man', 'who', 'almost', 'dead', 'inside', 'one', 'films', 'best', 'elements', 'watch', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'story', 'One', 'favorite', 'moments', 'Owen', 'Theo', 'who', 'been', 'walking', 'around', 'half-drunken', 'daze', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'just', 'survived', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'stumbles', 'alone', 'woods', 'cigarette', 'then', 'loss', 'horror', 'shadow', 'joy', 'still', 'capable', 'emotion', 'great', 'scene', 'truly', 'great', 'lead', 'performance', 'very', 'difficult', 'role', 'Theo', 'character', 'who', 'everything', 'not', 'showy', 'Owen', 'off', 'way', 'would', 'make', 'Bogart', 'proud', 'mention', 'Bogart', 'Children', 'Men', 'classic', 'quality', 'quiet', 'sadness', 'used', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'films', '40s', '50s', 'Setup', 'Out', 'Past', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'currency', 'bleakness', 'will', 'help', 'stand', 'test', 'time']",N/A
646644,AZ5T9WY670KYD,B00005JP9X,Audra Alexander,"[0, 0]","I saw Children of Men on DVD and granted, I wanted to like it. I was looking for a gritty, speculative fiction piece which would scare the crap out of my intellectual mind. Children of Men was just that! The story was terrifying; the idea that women the world over could be infertile and what would become of man as it's children ceased to exist was chillingly portrayed by the desperate, hopeless, and desolate characters in their squalid setting. A setting not entirely ""post-apocalyptic,"" but degraded to the point of gray sameness, without ambition and punctuated by war, criminal immigration, nuclear fallout, and unchecked terrorism. The protagonist, Theo Faron, is our slightly dingy window into this world. He is himself without hope or ambition, gray in his dress and demeanor, and the unlikely hero. Played with impeccable realism and empathy by Clive Owen, Theo is bitterly cynical and tinged with a sadness that is clearly an endless cycle of self loathing and self-pity. When Julian Taylor (actress Julianne Moore), an old lover, re-enters his life with an unexpected proposition, Theo shows his first signs of ""character"" when he eventually accepts.The journey that Theo undertakes to lead the world's only pregnant woman to safety is both physical and metaphorical. What I really liked about both journeys is their credibility. The movie supports the characters in every detail, from dialogue to set design to costume and even editing. This goes a long way toward creating the world that science fiction fans so long to see fully realized on the big screen. Then we can give ourselves over to the characterizations (brilliantly played by all the principles in this film) as they walk us through this harrowing ""what if"". Theo's often clumsy guardianship is heartbreaking; he's not an action hero, he's us and we cringe at his inelegant approach to fulfilling his duty. At one point he loses his shoes, forcing him to make an escape in borrowed flip flops. This suggestion of Theo's emotional nakedness is intended, I think, to make us uncomfortable, even embarrassed. But it also highlights that every step he takes thereafter is one of deliberate courage, a conscious decision to give himself over to hope.What this movie does not do is degrade into banal religious metaphors along the lines of the second coming, or suggest that women's infertility is in any way a punishment from god or nature. Although the characters briefly discuss those themes, this movie never becomes a ""cautionary tale"" geared towards getting us to recycle or go to church. In the face of all the wretchedness that human nature can dish out, Children of Men asks ""what if"" a man never gives up? Then suggests; it would save mankind.",5,A smart and direct film,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,2724,"['saw', 'Children', 'Men', 'DVD', 'granted', 'wanted', 'was', 'looking', 'gritty', 'speculative', 'fiction', 'piece', 'would', 'scare', 'crap', 'intellectual', 'mind', 'Children', 'Men', 'was', 'just', 'story', 'was', 'terrifying', 'idea', 'women', 'world', 'over', 'could', 'be', 'infertile', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'man', 'children', 'ceased', 'exist', 'was', 'chillingly', 'portrayed', 'desperate', 'hopeless', 'desolate', 'characters', 'squalid', 'setting', 'setting', 'not', 'entirely', 'post-apocalyptic', 'degraded', 'point', 'gray', 'sameness', 'ambition', 'punctuated', 'war', 'criminal', 'immigration', 'nuclear', 'fallout', 'unchecked', 'terrorism', 'protagonist', 'Theo', 'Faron', 'slightly', 'dingy', 'window', 'world', 'hope', 'ambition', 'gray', 'dress', 'demeanor', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'Played', 'impeccable', 'realism', 'empathy', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Theo', 'bitterly', 'cynical', 'tinged', 'sadness', 'clearly', 'endless', 'cycle', 'self', 'loathing', 'self-pity', 'When', 'Julian', 'Taylor', 'actress', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'old', 'lover', 're-enters', 'life', 'unexpected', 'proposition', 'Theo', 'first', 'signs', 'character', 'when', 'eventually', 'journey', 'Theo', 'undertakes', 'lead', 'world', 'only', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'safety', 'physical', 'metaphorical', 'What', 'really', 'liked', 'journeys', 'credibility', 'movie', 'characters', 'detail', 'dialogue', 'set', 'design', 'costume', 'even', 'editing', 'long', 'way', 'creating', 'world', 'science', 'fiction', 'fans', 'so', 'long', 'see', 'fully', 'realized', 'big', 'screen', 'Then', 'can', 'give', 'characterizations', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'principles', 'film', 'walk', 'harrowing', 'what', 'Theo', 'often', 'clumsy', 'guardianship', 'heartbreaking', 'not', 'action', 'hero', 'cringe', 'inelegant', 'approach', 'fulfilling', 'duty', 'one', 'point', 'shoes', 'forcing', 'make', 'escape', 'borrowed', 'flip', 'flops', 'suggestion', 'Theo', 'emotional', 'nakedness', 'intended', 'think', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'even', 'embarrassed', 'also', 'step', 'thereafter', 'one', 'deliberate', 'courage', 'conscious', 'decision', 'give', 'hope.What', 'movie', 'not', 'do', 'degrade', 'banal', 'religious', 'metaphors', 'lines', 'second', 'coming', 'suggest', 'women', 'infertility', 'way', 'punishment', 'god', 'nature', 'characters', 'briefly', 'discuss', 'themes', 'movie', 'never', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'geared', 'towards', 'getting', 'recycle', 'go', 'church', 'face', 'wretchedness', 'human', 'nature', 'can', 'dish', 'out', 'Children', 'Men', 'what', 'man', 'never', 'up', 'Then', 'would', 'save', 'mankind']",N/A

Marold""","[2, 5]","`Children of Men', directed by Alfonso Charon, and starring Clive Owen is being touted as a `Blade Runner' for the 21st Century. This blurb was the primary reason for my interest in viewing the DVD, since `Blade Runner' is easily on of the five (5) best all time Science Fiction movies.`Children of Men' is no `Blade Runner', and does not even have many similarities with `Blade Runner', aside from those things which every work labeled `Science Fiction' has in common with every other SciFi work and the fact that both are set in the 2020s. While `Blade Runner' is a relatively slow-paced `film noir' piece with a lot of exposition laying out the single underlying premise, `Children of Men' is a marathon of frenetic action and tension, with relatively little exposition to explain the reasons for the multiple `what if' premises which turn this into a SciFi flick. That does not mean this is a poor movie, only that comparing it to `Blade Runner' does not reveal anything insightful about the story.Part of the problem I had with the thinness of the exposition on the background is that there are two different premises driving the plot, and I could see no connection between the two, although there was plenty of interactions between the two premises. The first premise, clearly stated in the trailers, is the fact that the entire human population has gone infertile for the last 18 years (beginning in 2009). The second premise, working largely as the palate from which is painted the story's background is painted, is the assumption that the kind of insurgency common in Iraq today has spread to virtually all civilized countries.It may be that the most compelling thing about this movie is the way in which this background has been directed and filmed. The blocking and cinematography actually have a lot in common with Stephen Speilberg's first 15 minutes of `Saving Private Ryan'. The skill with which the camerawork emulates a documentary style makes one believe they are watching CNN, assuming CNN would actually air these scenes. Another movie with which `Children of Men' shares much is the recent English horror flick `28 Days Later', although `Children...' is far more original, with higher production values.The DVD's commentaries are a bit thin, and I'm surprised that they don't bring out the Christian allegory of the story line. While it may not be the primary theme, it should be obvious to anyone who views the movie at least twice.This is Clive Owen's film from start to finish. Costars Julianne Moore and Michael Caine appear in just a few short scenes each, and their top billing is primarily to highlight the importance of their scenes, which may be inadequately done by the narrative.This film easily has some of the socially and politically most interesting SciFi premises since `Soylent Green' and `Logan's Run', and is cinematically far more interesting than these relatively routine Hollywood products; but it won't make my list of top 10 best SciFi movies.",4,"Interesting, but unrelated premises.

The avian flu came and went in 2008, leaving devastating consequences, a reduced pollution. The war in the middle east has spread forcing immigrants toward Britain which is now the last surviving nation, while it appears the US has fallen into Civil War and anarchy, and Africa was destroyed in some kind of nuclear conflagration. It's also implied in expository dialogue that NYC has been obliterated in a terrorist nuclear attack. Worst of all, perhaps as a side effect of the bird flu(it's never fully explained) or just pollution or, natural extinction, no woman has been pregnant in 18 years. The result is a dying, depressed race, where the youngest person on earth who was 18, has been killed by a raving fan. Like V FOR VENDETTA(but less poetic than that film), the film reflects current politics and conflicts to their logical end-a totalitarian, police state society where any foreigners or those of another skin color are frowned upon, or outright locked up, tortured,killed or sent to an immigrant camp that resembles the West Bank. In all this we meet Theo(Clive Owen) a government worker who becomes, forcibly involved in helping a group of freedom fighters/terrorists, to secret out of England, the first pregnant woman in 18 years-Kee. Because she's African in origin, it's apparent why she has to be kept secret from the authorities and gotten to the altruistic ""Human Project"", a group of scientists attempting to jump start the human race. However the terrorists-called ""the Fish"" are anything but altruistic. What follows is a journey into hell itself when we see what a country becomes when almost everyone you are supposed to trust in authority is corrupt, including the police. Will they survive? Will Kee's child be the one hope humanity has?The film is cautionary science fiction. It's a tough watch but it's terrific. I'd put the action into the catagory of FULL METAL JACKET or even PLATOON, just with a science fiction edge.  All the stars give great performances-Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine being the noted actors.  Also, it has a terrific music soundtrack spiced with some great tunes such by Donovan, John Lennon,Deep Purple, King Crimson and a cover of the Stones' Ruby Tuesday-all add up to a poignant and nostalgic audio experience.",5,"Amazing, frightening, and plausible....",1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,2389,"['Children', 'Men', 'futuristic', 'Britain', 'where', 'everything', 'gone', 'Hell', 'about', '20', 'years', 'now', 'avian', 'flu', 'came', 'went', '2008', 'leaving', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'reduced', 'pollution', 'war', 'middle', 'east', 'spread', 'forcing', 'immigrants', 'Britain', 'now', 'last', 'surviving', 'nation', 'US', 'fallen', 'Civil', 'War', 'anarchy', 'Africa', 'was', 'destroyed', 'kind', 'nuclear', 'conflagration', 'also', 'implied', 'expository', 'dialogue', 'NYC', 'been', 'obliterated', 'terrorist', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'Worst', 'perhaps', 'side', 'effect', 'bird', 'flu', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'just', 'pollution', 'natural', 'extinction', 'woman', 'been', 'pregnant', '18', 'years', 'result', 'dying', 'depressed', 'race', 'where', 'youngest', 'person', 'earth', 'who', 'was', '18', 'been', 'killed', 'raving', 'fan', 'V', 'FOR', 'VENDETTA', 'less', 'poetic', 'film', 'film', 'current', 'politics', 'conflicts', 'logical', 'end-a', 'totalitarian', 'police', 'state', 'society', 'where', 'foreigners', 'skin', 'color', 'are', 'frowned', 'outright', 'locked', 'up', 'tortured', 'killed', 'sent', 'immigrant', 'camp', 'West', 'Bank', 'meet', 'Theo', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'government', 'worker', 'who', 'forcibly', 'involved', 'helping', 'group', 'freedom', 'fighters/terrorists', 'secret', 'England', 'first', 'pregnant', 'woman', '18', 'years-Kee', 'African', 'origin', 'apparent', 'why', 'be', 'kept', 'secret', 'authorities', 'gotten', 'altruistic', 'Human', 'Project', 'group', 'scientists', 'attempting', 'jump', 'start', 'human', 'race', 'However', 'terrorists-called', 'Fish', 'are', 'anything', 'altruistic', 'What', 'journey', 'hell', 'when', 'see', 'what', 'country', 'when', 'almost', 'everyone', 'are', 'supposed', 'trust', 'authority', 'corrupt', 'including', 'police', 'survive', 'Will', 'Kee', 'child', 'be', 'one', 'hope', 'humanity', 'film', 'cautionary', 'science', 'fiction', 'tough', 'watch', 'terrific', ""'d"", 'put', 'action', 'catagory', 'FULL', 'METAL', 'JACKET', 'even', 'PLATOON', 'just', 'science', 'fiction', 'edge', 'stars', 'give', 'great', 'performances-Clive', 'Owen', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'being', 'noted', 'actors', 'Also', 'terrific', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'spiced', 'great', 'tunes', 'such', 'Donovan', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'King', 'Crimson', 'cover', 'Stones', 'Ruby', 'Tuesday-all', 'up', 'poignant', 'nostalgic', 'audio', 'experience']",N/A

Brilliant and highly underated British actor!There are a few questions I truly expected to have answered that weren't and that is the only reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars.

I think this film covers all areas and hits you hard in making you consider YOUR individual contribution to society's demise.I think the marketing and comparisons to heavy sci-fi thrillers such as Blade Runner is sorely misleading and may have contributed to some  viewer's disappointment.

The cinematography was great, the future scenes horrible but credible, the plot a little difficult but not too hard to follow as described in other reviews preceeding this one.

The acting in all parts was good, expecially Michale Caine in his old John Lennon like role.  Clive Owen was a little passive and lacked emotion for all the turmoil that he passed through.

Indeed, even cars of the future are handled in a way that doesn't make them instantly laughable.  The direction cannot be faulted.  Neither can the actors, who uniformly turn in excellent and convincing performances.  We are immersed in the convincing future world of 2027.So why just three stars?

When Altman was at his height in the 70's (or any one of a number of the finest directors from that time)?This film is one for the record books with all of its creators at the top of their game (and Lubezki certainly deserved the Oscar; he could be the Almendros of his generation).  It propels the viewer right into the story (leaving clueless critics lamenting the ""glossing over of many of the specifics"" as they remain particularly obtuse to the clarity of the film's situation and the value of mystery and pace in a good story), but dwells on quiet and poignant angles and moments to reach into the deepest reservoirs of storytelling about our times.Just take one scene: the protagonist Theo (Clive Owen), fleeing the revolutionaries who had been his accomplices, works at finding a pair of shoes in the home of his friend Jasper (Michael Caine) and then happens upon a conversation between his fellow travelers and Jasper.  He stays hidden on the other side of the room, and Alfonso Cuaron uses the entire space of the screen to tell Theo's story and his solitude; the lighting and mise en sc&egrave;ne of the camera are nothing short of brilliant.  The ensuing reels of film are among the most compelling and wrenching that I've ever witnessed; both my wife and I were brought to tears by the intensity of this film, and this almost never happens these days.So we flip in the DVD: oh, yeah, another movie.

In fact, this could be one of the most important films to grace the silver screen in a long time, yet I won't give it the full five stars for a couple of reasons.First of all, Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, should be commended for what he has done here. This is a sharp, well produced and well choreographed film. Despite it's ugliness, it's a beautiful film.CHILDREN OF MEN is all gloom and doom. The youngest person on the planet has been assasinated. He was 18. There hasn't been a pregnancy on earth in years. The earth's human population is doomed. The world is in turmoil. Countries are in flames. Unrest is rampant. Terrorism is running wild.The color schemes are all grey and drab. Yet, despite all the ugliness and the grey sceneries. The camera shots are brilliant and beautiful. Cuar&oacute;n shot the film in a documentary style. It's as if you the viewer are running along side Theo Faron (Clive Owen) as he unwillingly falls into a save the world scenario. The violence is real and in your face. The explosions are gut churning and duck inspiring. What Cuar&oacute;n did with the camera in this film, WILL, without question, set a new standard for future films. More action films will be shot this way and I can't wait.So, why only 4 stars for such an important film. Oh, just a couple of things. First of all, the movie, story-wise, is a little one dimensional and anti-climatic. I won't give away anything, but I was hoping for more as the story played itself out.Secondly, the movie rests on the shoulders of a premise that a baby hasn't been born in nearly twenty-years and the human race has accepted its fate as doomed. In my humble opinion, that is slightly tough to swallow. If the human race is so void of humanity, as the movie suggests, I would think that sometime in those eighteen years, somebody would decide and okay the use of CLONING. Just a thought.Despite the downfalls, CHILDREN OF MEN, is not to be missed. Brilliant film.

646675,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JP9X,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 2]","Alfonso Cuaron's ""Children of Men"" works like all stories of dystopian societies do: it plunges a future society into chaos and comments on the direction today's society is going in. In the year 2027, governments have collapsed due to a major infertility problem. It seems that, for reasons no one is sure of, women are no longer capable of bearing children, and as a result, panic and fear has gripped the world. The story takes place in London, where a newly formed military government has control over everything. This is especially true when it comes to illegal immigrants, who are rounded up on a daily basis and sent to live in battle stricken refugee camps. Watching this film was a scary experience for me; what we have is a new version of an Orwellian civilization, where a failure to cooperate can lead to harsh penalties.The film begins with the news reporting the death of the world's youngest person (he was only eighteen). In an age where no new children are being born, such a loss is enough to make total strangers weep. Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) is quite aware of their grief, yet he can say nothing about it. Many years ago, he was an activist who rejected the government's strict regulations. But ever since the death of his young son, he's lived a humdrum life, monotonously going to work everyday carrying a cup of coffee. Only when he's kidnapped at gunpoint does his life get interesting; he's taken to a secret location and reunited with his estranged ex-wife, Julian (Julianne Moore). Apparently, she's now part of a terrorist group that demands equality for all immigrants.She kidnapped Theo because she needs his help. Apparently, a girl from Fiji needs the proper papers in order to safely cross into a restricted area. He can use his influence on his cousin--a high-ranking British minister--to get these papers. He's initially reluctant to be a part of Julian's plans ... until he actually meets the Fijian girl. Her name is Kee (Claire-Hope Ashity), and she has a big secret: she's eight months pregnant.What follows is a dangerous journey through England, pitting the characters against seemingly insurmountable odds, including raids, deception, gunfire, and death. What makes the situation more difficult is that not everyone in this film as easy to trust as one might think; a number of characters have hidden agendas, not the least of which is preparation for The Uprising, which will supposedly pave the way to a new tomorrow by overthrowing the government. Those affiliated with The Uprising want Kee's baby for themselves, if not for a safe haven, then for a way to show the world that they are capable of starting a new society. It would seem that in this bleak future, money, land, and goods are not humanity's most valuable possession. Babies are. A baby means that there's hope for the future.In realizing the position Kee is in, and in understanding that danger is consistently surrounding her, Theo decides to help her himself. There are very few he can rely on for help; it seems that the only two trustworthy people are the holistic Miriam (Pam Ferris) and the philosophical stoner Jasper (Michael Caine). Soon word begins to spread about a secret development called The Human Project, which is a way to start a new society. This will be Kee's sanctuary as well as her baby's. It's only a matter of getting them both there before it's too late.Most of the narrative ideas in this film are not new; if anything, they're derivative of other futuristic Anti Establishment stories, such as ""1984,"" ""Escape from New York,"" ""V for Vendetta,"" and ""Mad Max."" However, there's an underlying optimism that makes this story unique. Even when the bombs explode, the bullets fly, and the blood spills, I couldn't help but feel that Cuaron was working towards a more positive resolution, as if to say that hope is in fact a good thing to have. I even felt that way during a long shot, in which the camera follows Theo as he runs through the rubble of a refugee camp, trying to dodge the barrage of gunfire. A man is murdered in the midst of the fighting, and a few drops of blood hit the camera lens. It was a powerful reminder of humanity's weaknesses, especially since the scene doesn't cut to a new shot.Dr. Phil occasionally says that the past is gone and the future hasn't happened yet; the only time is now. Films like ""Children of Men"" could reinforce such a perspective, considering the future we're presented with is one to avoid at all costs. What good will come from thinking ahead towards a dark, cruel future? I think that's the point the film is trying to make, which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. This is a fascinating film, filled with complex issues and difficult situations, all of which come together to form an appropriate ending.",4,The Birth of a New Age,1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,4792,"['Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'Children', 'Men', 'stories', 'dystopian', 'societies', 'do', 'future', 'society', 'chaos', 'comments', 'direction', 'today', 'society', 'going', 'year', '2027', 'governments', 'have', 'collapsed', 'due', 'major', 'infertility', 'problem', 'reasons', 'one', 'sure', 'women', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'capable', 'bearing', 'children', 'result', 'panic', 'fear', 'gripped', 'world', 'story', 'place', 'London', 'where', 'newly', 'formed', 'military', 'government', 'control', 'everything', 'especially', 'true', 'when', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'who', 'are', 'rounded', 'up', 'daily', 'basis', 'sent', 'live', 'battle', 'stricken', 'refugee', 'camps', 'Watching', 'film', 'was', 'scary', 'experience', 'what', 'have', 'new', 'version', 'Orwellian', 'civilization', 'where', 'failure', 'cooperate', 'can', 'lead', 'harsh', 'penalties.The', 'film', 'news', 'reporting', 'death', 'world', 'youngest', 'person', 'was', 'only', 'eighteen', 'age', 'where', 'new', 'children', 'are', 'being', 'born', 'such', 'loss', 'enough', 'make', 'total', 'strangers', 'weep', 'Theodore', 'Faron', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'quite', 'aware', 'grief', 'yet', 'can', 'say', 'nothing', 'Many', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'activist', 'who', 'rejected', 'government', 'strict', 'regulations', 'ever', 'death', 'young', 'son', 'lived', 'humdrum', 'life', 'monotonously', 'going', 'work', 'everyday', 'carrying', 'cup', 'coffee', 'Only', 'when', 'kidnapped', 'gunpoint', 'life', 'get', 'interesting', 'taken', 'secret', 'location', 'reunited', 'estranged', 'ex-wife', 'Julian', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Apparently', 'now', 'part', 'terrorist', 'group', 'equality', 'immigrants.She', 'kidnapped', 'Theo', 'help', 'Apparently', 'girl', 'Fiji', 'proper', 'papers', 'order', 'safely', 'cross', 'restricted', 'area', 'can', 'use', 'influence', 'cousin', 'high-ranking', 'British', 'minister', 'get', 'papers', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'be', 'part', 'Julian', 'plans', 'actually', 'Fijian', 'girl', 'name', 'Kee', 'Claire-Hope', 'Ashity', 'big', 'secret', 'eight', 'months', 'dangerous', 'journey', 'England', 'pitting', 'characters', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'including', 'raids', 'deception', 'gunfire', 'death', 'What', 'situation', 'more', 'difficult', 'not', 'everyone', 'film', 'easy', 'trust', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'number', 'characters', 'have', 'hidden', 'agendas', 'not', 'least', 'preparation', 'Uprising', 'will', 'supposedly', 'pave', 'way', 'new', 'tomorrow', 'overthrowing', 'government', 'affiliated', 'Uprising', 'want', 'Kee', 'baby', 'not', 'safe', 'haven', 'then', 'way', 'show', 'world', 'are', 'capable', 'starting', 'new', 'society', 'would', 'seem', 'bleak', 'future', 'money', 'land', 'goods', 'are', 'not', 'humanity', 'most', 'valuable', 'possession', 'Babies', 'are', 'A', 'baby', 'hope', 'future.In', 'realizing', 'position', 'Kee', 'understanding', 'danger', 'consistently', 'surrounding', 'Theo', 'help', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'can', 'rely', 'help', 'only', 'two', 'trustworthy', 'people', 'are', 'holistic', 'Miriam', 'Pam', 'Ferris', 'philosophical', 'stoner', 'Jasper', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Soon', 'word', 'spread', 'secret', 'development', 'called', 'Human', 'Project', 'way', 'start', 'new', 'society', 'will', 'be', 'Kee', 'sanctuary', 'as', 'well', 'baby', 'only', 'matter', 'getting', 'too', 'late.Most', 'narrative', 'ideas', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'new', 'anything', ""'re"", 'derivative', 'other', 'futuristic', 'Anti', 'Establishment', 'stories', 'such', '1984', 'Escape', 'New', 'York', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'Mad', 'Max', 'However', 'underlying', 'optimism', 'story', 'unique', 'Even', 'when', 'bombs', 'explode', 'bullets', 'fly', 'blood', 'spills', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'Cuaron', 'was', 'working', 'more', 'positive', 'resolution', 'say', 'hope', 'fact', 'good', 'thing', 'have', 'even', 'felt', 'way', 'long', 'shot', 'camera', 'Theo', 'rubble', 'refugee', 'camp', 'trying', 'dodge', 'barrage', 'gunfire', 'man', 'murdered', 'midst', 'fighting', 'few', 'drops', 'blood', 'hit', 'camera', 'was', 'powerful', 'reminder', 'humanity', 'weaknesses', 'especially', 'scene', ""n't"", 'cut', 'new', 'shot.Dr', 'Phil', 'occasionally', 'past', 'gone', 'future', ""n't"", 'happened', 'yet', 'only', 'time', 'now', 'Films', 'Children', 'Men', 'could', 'reinforce', 'perspective', 'considering', 'future', ""'re"", 'presented', 'one', 'avoid', 'costs', 'What', 'good', 'will', 'come', 'thinking', 'ahead', 'dark', 'cruel', 'future', 'think', 'point', 'film', 'trying', 'make', 'probably', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'fascinating', 'film', 'filled', 'complex', 'issues', 'difficult', 'situations', 'come', 'together', 'form', 'appropriate', 'ending']",N/A

I hate to compare it to another movie, because that's unfair, but it's a lot like Tron (another movie about the future) but with like zero special effects.  Which brings me to point #1: how do you make a movie about the future with zero special effects?  Hello?  It's the future.  This future looks like downtown New Jersey!Secondly I do not like movies about there being no more babies, because I think that children are our future, so right there I have a big problem with the storyline.  How do you make a movie about the future (with children in the title, no less!) in a future with no kids?  Tron had kids (and neon-electric special effects, I might add)The main character is played by Michael Caine and he is some kind of future hippie who lives with his wife in a secret lair.  Meanwhile, Julianne Moore and Clive Owen drive around escorting this pregnant lady whle the world goes to heck in a handbasket.  It's reminiscent of Total Recall, but nobody injects probes into their nose while holograms say ""get your *ss to Mars.""  By the way--are their other planets in this future?  That's just lazy filmmaking to not discuss this important point.Basically by the end of the movie, it's like a war movie with Clive Owen running around everywhere, and he never even picks up a gun, which is silly with so many people shooting at him.  He'd be dead real quick in any of the futures I've ever dreamed about.If you want to check out a much better movie about children and the future, do yourself a favor and rent ""Look Who's Talking Now"" which takes place in the future after ""Look Who's Talking"" and ""Look Who's Talking Too.""

646681,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00005JP9X,Clare Quilty,"[3, 7]","I'm always interested to read about classic films that flopped upon their initial release and only got appreciation years later.""Man of the West,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""Seconds"" ... um ... ""Office Space"" and especially in this case, ""Blade Runner"" and ""Touch of Evil.""To that list, I believe we'll eventually add ""Children of Men,"" which I honestly feel was the absolute best movie of 2006.When the end titles flashed up on the screen, I was jolted. I had one of those rare moviegoing experiences where I felt I'd just seen something amazing and awe-inspiring.But apparently about half of the people who saw the film completely disagree. After I saw the movie, I wound up in a lot of conversations with people and kept hearing (and, on Amazon, reading) the complaint, ""Well, we never found out WHY the women in this movie became infertile."" And although I understand the curiousity, I was actually proud of the film for not breaking it all down for us. I think we can suspend disbelief, especially given the conditions of the movie's world. And, really, had the movie in one of its many flashes to the television, offered up a ""Jurassic Park""-style primer on the mass infertility, I still don't think the naysayers would've been satisfied.Admittedly, for some, ""Children"" is a long row to hoe. Writer-director Alfonso Cuaron makes the viewer really work to piece together the plot, and some of the stories questions go completely unanswered, but I'd much rather walk out of a movie still wondering than exit with everything neatly wrapped up. That's why I buy/rent movies on DVD and watch them a second time.And given the movie's apocalyptic and distopian premise, it would've been completely presumptuous for Cuaron to give viewers any kind of concrete resolution.But there's so much to like here: The totally plausible background story about Baby Diego; those three amazing extended takes; a really brave and against-type turn by Clive Owen (who, all through the movie, looks like a shirt that's been pulled out of a washing machine and not properly dried -- hey, he picks up the change that the bad guys throw to him, you gotta love that); little touches like the use of Guernica, the Pink Floyd pig and the statue of David with a prosthetic leg; a Ken Russellian shot set to King Crimson; and especially the widwife's explanation of *how* (not why) the infertility began, which is really all the explanation the problem needs.It all adds up to a challenging, somewhat mind-boggling movie. I wish more people had liked it as much as I did, but then again it's not really the kind of film that people immediately reach out and embrace. Hey, there are wars going on.*** As much as I liked it, I will for balance lodge a few complaints: I hated that awful cover of ""Ruby Tuesday"" that got trotted out not once, but twice; I felt Michael Caine's otherwise excellent performance was marred by his excessive use of the word, ""Amigo""; I don't believe a man could disable three vehicles while standing within whispering distance of armed guards; I didn't believe a certain medical procedure that occurs toward the end of the film could be performed as easily as it was under the conditions depicted; and I really wish Cuaron hadn't called the Human Project's boat ""Tomorrow."" But, hey, in the overall picture those problems are minor, especially compared to the wonder of that last six-minute tracking shot, which, as it happens, is the only tracking shot the DVD's extra features *don't* explain. And there again, I'm not sure I really need to know.",4,"""C'mon, Baby Diego? The guy was a wanker.""

With movies that become unlikely successes like the Blair Witch Project or Big Fat Greek Wedding then you see the error of how Children of Men was marketed, it feels criminal. Alfonso Cuaron's follow-up to the well-praised (even though I wasn't that over-ecstatic about it) Y Tu Mama Tambien is just an all around well-crafted film and a chilling idea about where the world could be headed.Set in 2027, women around the world inexplicably have become infertile and unable to bear children. To make matters worse, the youngest person in the world was killed when he refused to sign autographs. Main character and former activist Theo knows its a horrible world but he's in a kind of ""oh well"" state of mind. His ex Julian, who is still being an anti-government activist, comes to him with a favor: safeguard a woman named Kee. Special thing is she's 8 months pregnant and in this world, she would make a perfect bargaining tool and political stronghold so Theo has to escort Kee to the ""Human Project"" which will help her and the baby.What the film does right in presenting the future is it doesn't take the Blade Runner approach and just simply go nuts with technology. There's been some advances but there's also been some regression and England has been reduced to a graffiti-covered hellzone and in one nice on-going joke, Theo keeps trading old shoes and clothes for other ones because he has to rather than just walk into a shoe store and get a new pair. And the notion that the entire female population becomes infertile seems almost sci-fi but then you go ""well, if that and that happens, you never know..."".While it's primarily a drama, it's arguably got 2 of the best action scenes of the year and strangely, they're all in the same movie and all done in one take. One (which had to be supported with a big camera rig) takes place in a car while another has us follow Theo through the streets as everything is getting shot at left and right. What makes these work is not only do they work production-wise when you think about it (6-8 minutes at most with one mistake making you redo 8 minutes over again), but dramatically they work as well and they're not just cool camera trickeries just for the sake of showing off.Then of course there's the acting and our anchor is Clive Owen. To be honest, he was kind of bland in Sin City (probably because the voiceover was that way) but here he really shines, playing a troubled man and one who isn't some action-hero all of a sudden. He makes mistakes and his accomplishments are that much better. Julianne Moore plays a pivotal-but-small role as Julian while Michael Caine plays Theo's friend Jasper. He always works in every film he does but giving him an almost hippie quality doesn't gel as much.

646684,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00005JP9X,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 3]","I suspect that if one agrees with what appears to be director Alfonso Cuaron's premise, that humankind's basest instincts for selfishness, fouling its own nest, violence toward each other and the acceptance of authoritarianism when faced with fear can be met by the redemptive power of hope and love, then one will accept Children of Men as a film of emotional power.For me, Children of Men is a movie in which Cuaron tries to stuff in far too many actions. He seems to aiming for the kind of allegory that can change the way we feel about our lives, but he winds up making many of the compromises that movies force upon some directors as they find themselves with big budgets to work with and the need to sell tickets to justify the investment.The story, as has been pointed out by others, is one big Macguffin. It's 2027 and civilization has fallen to its knees. The world is nothing but chaos, terrorism, a rotting environment and death. Britain has managed to survive as a nation state by becoming a horrendous dictatorship, needing immigrants for menial work and turning them into outcasts, periodically rounding them up along with the fugees, the refugees from the world's chaos who managed to slip past Britain's barriers. Concentration camps are filling up, laws are enforced with ferocity, there are no civil rights and the government has become the greatest killer of them all. In exchange, the British have order.And it has been 19 years since a baby was born, anywhere in the world. Humankind has mysteriously become sterile. The point of the movie is that a frightened young woman is discovered to be pregnant. In an instant she becomes the center of the movie...will she be used by rebels to try to undermine the government? Will she find a way to escape by sea to some almost mythical group of scientists who are searching for peace and an answer to humankind's infertility? Will she and her baby be killed? Will they survive? It seems her only hope will be a burned-out, used-up functionary who once tried to change things, years ago. From the time this man first meets this scared girl-child and realizes that she's pregnant, to the end of the movie in a small rowboat waiting to see if mankind has a future, we're on a medieval journey through the terrors of hell as the girl and her protector deal with hatred, avarice, brutality, imprisonment, death and war.The question for me was: Is all this Macguffining well done enough to be interesting? If it is, is the story itself worth it?You'll have to make up your own minds. Simply as a story, I think whatever success Children of Men has had has depended on Clive Owen. He's the protector and he's in just about every scene. Owen is a fine actor. Unlike many actors who have made it to the top, he is most effective reacting. He seldom indulges in flashy heroics in his movies and doesn't do so here. At first, he's uncertain, confused and cautious. When he commits himself to the journey, he doesn't have all the answers, just a willingness to take advantage of opportunities and to risk his life because he's come to believe in what he is doing. It's a first-rate performance.But then we have Julianne Moore as a rebel leader and Owen's former wife. In my view, she's too big a name for the size of the part, and the part is too large for the story. Michael Caine has a juicy role as Owen's older friend. He's gotten up to look like Brent Spiner in Independence Day. Caine does a nice job, but both he and Moore infect the movie with ""star"" presence. I think both roles would have been better for the movie if played by little known but good actors. Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent as a dedicated and even ruthless rebel leader. But the movie only needs Owen, and he delivers.Cuaron, in this medieval miracle tale, has given us a great look at the hell humanity has made for itself. At times, for me, he lingers on and expands this view the better to sell tickets. The whole extended urban battle at the end of the movie seemed to go on and on for no great purpose than to show us how a well-crafted urban war can be presented. Most of the movie's horrors, in fact, are so carefully framed and photographed, so well and ingeniously lit, that I was always aware I was watching a movie. Most movie-ish of all was that heavenly voice wafting down on us as humanity's redemption is resolved by a young mother and her baby.This is one of those movies that, for me, needs to be taken seriously simply because a talented director with serious themes has made it. In this era of endless comic book movies and films with the old ultra violence, Curaon deserves our respect. So does Clive Owen.Try Owen inCroupier. To see Julianne Moore at her finest, tryVanya on 42nd Steet.

646685,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B00005JP9X,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[7, 9]","So reads the apocalyptic billboard graffiti which appears in one of the opening scenes of Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's ""Children of Men,"" and that's just the kind of bleak but brilliant (and morbidly humorous) touch that epitomizes this film and its landscape.The year is 2027, and the world is having a tough day.  Nay, make that a tough century.  Ever since the flu pandemic of 2008 (get your inoculations, people!), there have been no baby births for 18 years.  We know this because the film opens with a shot of downtrodden Brits gathering around a TV set in a coffee shop, crying over the death of ""Baby Diego"" (the heretofore world's youngest person), with non-stop coverage that's probably provided by the British version of Inside Edition (assuming they've moved on from Anna Nicole Smith news by then).From one of many TV's suspended from the ceiling of a commuter train on Theo Faron's (Clive Owen) trip home from work (where everyone was slacking, watching streaming video coverage of Baby Diego - good to see that at least some things don't change in the future!), we learn something else: ""The World Has Collapsed - Only Britain Soldiers On,"" says the announcer.Yeah sure thing, Mr. Announcer: tell that to the mob of debris-hurling miscreants attacking the train.  Or Theo himself, who just a little earlier narrowly avoided getting blown to bits when the aforementioned coffee shop exploded.  Suffice it to say, Britain is not soldiering on quite as well as the onboard propaganda would have you believe - or maybe it's all relative, since we also see a lovely montage of the rest of the world engulfed in various explosions and insurgencies.  On the other hand, we also find things so topsy-turvy in futuristic Britannia, that people actually drive on the left side of the street - preposterous, I say!Regardless, Theo's having a tough day too, and it's about to get tougher when an old flame (Julianne Moore) recruits him to assist with the riskiest midwifery the future has ever seen.  He then gets caught up in navigating his way through clashes between the government and an Uprising that may or may not turn out to be more dangerous to a baby than dingoes in the outback  And all the poor bloke really wants is a drink.  Gadzooks.""Children of Men"" is exceptional with what it does well, and disappointing for what it does not.  What it does well: cinematography, editing and production design.  The sets are brilliantly and meticulously detailed, even if they lack some of the special effects and gadgetry that some might feel the future should be infused with.  As others have also remarked upon, the long uninterrupted takes are unprecedented in an action movie of this scope and scale, and the camerawork and choreography are exquisite.Another nifty touch I particularly appreciated was the seemingly incongruous injections of wildlife in the urban decay: the deer in the school, the sheep in the street and the chickens in the stairwell - all perhaps reminding us that life will go on with or without us, and psychologically ratcheting up the stakes on a subconscious level.The films also does a good job of including controversial aspects of today's political landscape, which act as visual and aural markers that connect the viewer from the world of today to the world that's depicted onscreen.  We will all no doubt recognize the use of dogs and hoods in the detention center, the phrase ""homeland security"" and the flyers for the missing.  (Plus, as Theo's hippie friend Jasper (Michael Caine) points out, suicide kits and antidepressants are provided in governmentally-distributed ration packs, but pot is STILL illegal...)  Whether one agrees or not with the editorial choices behind these images, I feel their use creates an urgency that the film would lack were there not such intensely recognizable elements from today's political climate appearing amidst the action.Where the film disappoints me: plot, writing and - surprisingly enough - acting.  First, the plot.  However well filmed, this movie is really just one big chase scene.  And brilliant premise notwithstanding (a premise whose explanation I personally don't feel is necessary), there's little in the way of what one could legitimately label ""intrigue"".Also, the writing is a bit heavy-handed at times.  In one scene, the annoying Miriam (Pam Ferris) becomes the Queen of Exposition: ""As the sound of the playgrounds faded, the despair set in.""  Ugh.  Might as well have used an omniscient narrative voiceover for that clunker of a line (and here's where I might infer something from the fact that this movie has five credited screenwriters, if I were a cynical fellow - which I obviously am not, ha ha).Lastly, the acting - while serviceable - could have been so much more, given the talent level of the cast.  I'm guessing that the nuts and bolts technical aspects of shooting such difficult scenes must have played havoc with at least some of the actors' performances.Overall, this film has a pretty big ""wow"" factor - especially for fans of cinematography and set design and all that kind of filmmaking wankery (which I do love).  But a more intricate plot, and better writing/acting could have pushed it into the realm of a classic.  As it is, I'm hovering between three and four stars for the film, but the DVD features are just enough that I'll lean towards the four (even though I'm disappointed at the lack of any commentary tracks).",4,Last One to Die - Please Turn Out the Light,1175644800,"04 4, 2007",2007,5434,"['So', 'apocalyptic', 'billboard', 'graffiti', 'one', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute',

It's easy to believe that in a world where societies have crumbled and no child has been born for 18 years, many different factions would kill and/or die to use this miracle child to leverage their own agenda.The biggest problem I had with the film was that, for the life of me, I couldn't draw the correlation between infertility and the collapse of civilization that the movie wants you to take for granted. The film presents a very realistic possible future, whether the human race becomes infertile or not. In fact, in the short term, infertility would ease a lot of our planet's problems - like over-crowding and limited resources - and likely make life better for everyone. In my experience, we as humans don't look that far ahead - so our species is going to be extinct in 60-80 years? How much would that really affect the way we lived today?

It's one man's quest to save another person, from what, we are never told - but why bother with details? The violence is so graphic, and frequent, it must consume half the movie! To be perfectly honest I left the theater feeling bored and empty! I was also incredulous: Where's the story? At least Saving Private Ryan had a beginning, middle and end.  This mockery of a sci-fi film had virtually no beginning or end - it felt like one overly long chapter of a book taken out of context.  Not my idea of good story telling!I can only speculate this film is doing so well in the United States because a large segment of the American public enjoys watching scenes of incredible violence and destruction. I'm tired of it! It's dreary, monotonous, and annoying! We have enough butchering going on in the real world that I don't need to pay to watch it, too!What makes this movie so incredibly sad is the waste of such outstanding acting talent! Don't actors, and their agents, bother to read the scripts before they sign on? If top acting talent started saying no to junk, then junk would be harder to sell to the movie going public!What messages is the viewer left with while watching this godforsaken movie? The human race will go barren for no apparent reason. The world, except Great Britain, (for some strange reason), will be reduced to savagery. The British government that does survives will, of course,  be fascist. Those who oppose the government will have to be terrorists. The good guys are so few, there's only a handful of people willing to save the last child on earth. People become terrorists because, ""they just want respect!"" (How touching, I never knew terrorists had such sensitive feelings!) The good guys come out of the blue, and you will know absolutely nothing about them, except they know how to pilot a large boat. People die constantly from stray bullets. (Then don't stand-up while the shooting is going on silly!) So many people die in this film, it becomes an art form: How many different ways can people possibly fall down in the same movie? It must set some sort of record!I repeat! This is not sci-fi! This is a war film, geared to teenage boys and young men. If you want to see really powerful & intelligent sci-fi then let your fingers do the walking over the Internet and purchase: 1. Zardoz, 2.

You meet a beautiful girl and she says all the right things, you take her out to dinner and the meal is great and of course she looks very good as well. Midway through the night you go back to your place and then she falls asleep. You never can wake her up and you start to wonder where you are and why you're in this situation. Ultimately you're very unsatisfied with your date.That is how I felt watching ""Children Of Men"". It had the right idea and the story was unique. Visually I liked how the movie presented itself and in High Definition it looked spectacular. They painted a bleak and hopeless existence just twenty years in the future. The beginning of the movie was setup nicely, but somewhere along the way the train went off the tracks and it just leaves you sitting there with no place to go. Well, you have an idea of where you should be going, but this film never takes you there.Clive Owen's performance is hit and miss. For most of the film his is left with a deer-in-headlights look on his face, which is probably really realistic, considering there are bullets whizzing by his head 99% of the time. In retrospect he did what he could with his character, who is basically on the run and has no real given purpose. The highlight is when he knocks the guys off the motorcycle with his car door, that was a cool little part that I enjoyed.The ending is a complete waste and to me it seems like a cop-out.

If anything, it's more of a Christian allegory than anything else. The protagonist is named Theo (Greek for ""god""), the movie opened in the USA on Christmas Day, and the story is basically a Nativity story set in a bleak, fascist future. It's a bit ponderous and heavy-handed in places, but overall ""Children of Men"" does a great job of making the world it is set in real and frightening. On its own merits, I'd give it four stars.Unfortunately, I have to dock this DVD a half-point or more for its inclusion of an unnecessary, irrelevant, and highly biased ""bonus feature"" called ""The Possibility of Hope,"" which is complete rubbish.

646703,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JP9X,Dennis Littrell,"[8, 13]","Science fiction is always about the present.  This has been true since the beginning of science fiction.  It has to be true since we can only extrapolate from the present to the future.  Only rarely, once in a million tries perhaps, does somebody come up with something truly original, or something unpredictable.  Leonard Da Vinci foresaw submarines, but if you think about it, he had the example of turtles, whales and dolphins.  Who foresaw nuclear energy? Who foresaw electricity and all that it can do?So this is about the present.  The refugee camp could be in Palestine.  The round up of immigrants is what many people in Europe and the US want.  It may happen tomorrow; in fact it is happening to some extent.  The irony and perhaps the illogic of this film is that with no babies being born, now for eighteen years, there is no labor force coming on to do the grunt work of society.  So why are the Brits in a frenzy of anti-immigration?  Apparently because of a fascist government has come to power.This reminds me a bit of something from Terry Gilliam who directed 12 Monkeys (1995) and Brazil (1985).  There is something about the decadent and bombed out feel of the scenes that is the same.This is a film for the underdog, for the oppressed.  It is in a symbolic sense a statement about aging Europe with its declining birth rates needing the fertility of people from southern climes, people of color to save the world from extinction.  In Europe today there are countries with birth rates so low that their populations are declining.  In both Europe and the US it is immigrants who are supporting the declining populations which are increasingly old.  In the US we have winked at the influx of illegal immigrants for decades because those in power know two things: (1) cheap labor is good for their bottom line; and (2) without young people paying into social security, the system will go bankrupt.The sets were exquisite, the battle scenes in the refugee camp seemed as authentic as the nightly news, well focused and involving.  The camera work was outstanding and carefully set up.  Michael Caine as the aging hippy was perfect.  I saw him recently in The Prestige (2006) and I have to say, he is like a man with a new career in his mid-seventies.  Claire-Hope Ashitey, who played Kee with her big eyes and her fresh face and her reserved style was also very good.  Clive Owen looked as heroic as the part demanded, and Julianne Moore in a limited role was good.There was some corniness in the movie and some politically correct stuff, like Kee braiding the old woman's hair and our hero being sensitive enough to be a midwife (today's men are above and beyond the purely macho).  There is also a root for the underdog feel throughout with the good guys (relatively speaking) being outsiders.  The scene where the government troops stand in awe of a baby's cry was striking (imagine how Spielberg would have milked this!), but I suspect that somebody, at hearing of the first human birth in over eighteen years, would have ignored the resumption of fire and stayed with the only woman on earth who was fertile.  I think everyone would have wanted to protect her and her baby.A nice touch that director Alfonso Cuaron could have brought to the film was to show us people doing extreme things in their desperation to have children, worshipping icons of fertility maybe, acting out weird rituals while imbibing strange concoctions.  Instead of just showing some religious demonstrators blaming the lack of human fertility on sinfulness, we might have gotten a glimpse of fertility cults drinking the essence of goat eggs or rhino horns as they danced around some fertility symbol.  Maybe there could have been a national health crisis as myriads of people, especially women, went crazy or committed suicide because of depression brought on by infertility.  Actually there was a hint of this in the movie but it was greatly underdeveloped.Another problem with this film (from my POV; for others this might be a plus) is that the direction relies heavily on action sequences.  There are chase scenes (and a nice car door opening gimmick used twice, once to knock the bad guys off their motorcycles, and once to knock down one of the fishes holding a gun).  But there was little subtlety in the story.  Most of the subtlety in the movie is in the scenes themselves and in the camera work.  And the characters are rather one-dimensional.  Theo (Clive Owen) is merely heroic.  He fights through the bullets and the other obstacles to help Kee and her baby.  Kee herself is hardly developed at all.  Michael Caine's character Jasper is the only one with any real depth.Two final points: I don't think this film is nearly as interesting as Cuaron's Y tu mama tambien (2001), and I would not dream of watching this film without subtitles since a lot of the dialogue is almost inaudible to these ancient ears.By the way, a discussion of why women were infertile and how the movie differs from the book

After a few bad Mother Mary jokes and what can only be seen as a paycheck role for Michael Caine, several almost unbelievable characters help Owen get the woman to the coast before he dies sitting in a boat as the Green Peace people pull up beside the small dinghy with the dead Owen, the Fujiian and her new baby daughter (supposedly the new Eve, if you're one to read positivity into a bleak situation.)

Suggs,"[6, 13]","Children of Men stir so many emotions that it's hard to wrap your mind around all it's trying to convey, so let's start with the special features discussion.1st. How come the negative impact of globalization and capitalization is always told from leftist point of view? I'm certainly more liberal than conservative, but I'd still like to hear the conservative version of the argument.2nd. How come these views never credit mankind with its equally overwhelming successes? Industry, medicine and technology to name a few, have also provided us (the world at large) with some amazing advantages.3rd. How come we (civilized nations) never hold the leaders of depressed nations publicly accountable for the role they play in devastating their nations infrastructure? i.e. Africa, old Yugoslavia, etc. And since when throughout history have we not had a separation of some kind whether it be racial, religious or economic; whereby, one group profits at the expense of the other group?In Children of Men, Clive Owen is a reluctant semi-hero, who's approached by his social leader-ex-wife, played by Julianne Moore, to protect the world's only pregnant woman. Infertility; the result of global mismanagement, has turned pregnancy and youth into precious commodities (as if they weren't) and political fallout i.e. racism and the unequal division of wealth have made life hard.

What drove them to such different circumstances? We need the answers to these questions before we can fully believe their commitment.

The ""world's youngest living person"" has tragically died at 18, to the dismay of millions of ""fans"". Authorities in the U.K. continue a relentless,SS-style round up of all illegal immigrants, crowding them into Gitmo-like compounds. Most significantly, scientists remain at a loss to explain why a universal plague of female infertility continues unabated into its eighteenth year. These are some of the cheery news headlines dominating the year 2027 in the not so distant, dystopian future of Alfonso Cuaron's  ""Children of Men.""The story is set in (a not so) jolly old England, where we are introduced to glum-faced Theo (Clive Owen), a world-weary bloke working in some kind of vague, low-level bureaucratic job in London. He is not having a good morning. After narrowly escaping death by terrorist bombing on the way to work, he decides to beg off a day at the office, only to be kidnapped by a group of radical human rights activistsIt turns out that the cell is led by Theo's ex-wife (Julianne Moore), who wants him to use his connections to pull some strings and help out a ""very important"" colleague, (a female immigrant with a Big Secret). Initially, the reluctant Theo is determined to keep his activist roots safely embedded in the past, but fate and circumstance soon rekindle his old idealism, and he finds himself risking life and limb to help deliver the only known fertile woman in the world to the sanctuary of an organization called the Human Project .The film ultimately spreads itself a bit too thin as a political potboiler; there are too many confusing factions of insurgents, activists and terrorists running about killing government troops and each other with equal abandon (not unlike Iraq). However, the film does become quite gripping as a straight-ahead action-thriller, especially in its final third. Cuaron effectively applies an oppressive, steel-grey visual look to his cold, cruelly bleak future vision.From a purely thematic standpoint, I thought that the rampant use of Christ metaphor became a bit much (especially in an eye-rolling Big Death Scene that is a bit too reminiscent of ""The Omega Man"").There still are enough good reasons to recommend seeing this film, particularly for the uniformly excellent performances. The ubiquitous Michael Caine steals all of his scenes as Theo's mentor, an aging hippie activist.

In this case, it's an Orwellian-fascist state riddled with violence and paranoia, with a refugee crisis that threatens to topple the fragile underpinnings of a brutal police state.  The film is very dark, but has a mordant sense of humor that is its savings grace.  It's also directed in a half-dreamy style that curiously undercuts the action-movie cliches -- a car chase takes place with in a broken hatchback that our hero is trying to bump-start, as the bad guys chase him on foot; later he loses his shoes and runs through the rubble wearing only a pair of plastic flip-flop sandals.All in all, this was a very effective, but inherently frightening view of the future.

It is something like a fairy tale of the old school variety; once Clive Owen leaves the path and wanders into the trees, he falls from danger to danger.I am told that the movie is dystopic, in the tradition of Orwell, Huxley, Rand and Levin. I'm told that it has a strong political bent. I don't find either of these claims to be particularly true. While it is the case that the film is set in a future-gone-bad, the movie rarely stops long enough to catch its breath to develop any real philosophical or political messages, and that's what I find distinctive about the great dytopias of the 20th Century. They were trying to identify trends in society that would lead us all to ruin. Children of Men, on the other hand, introduces a out-of-left-field plot element to bring us low (making all women barren), and then just uses the setting as a dark backdrop for, what is, essentially an action flick.Oh, along the way, we might argue that the film is in favor of, say, immigration rights or the legalization of marijuana, or such, but these do not form any particular, actual indictment against the society presented, here. They are simply little political statements included, as one might incorporate a product placement by having a character drink a can of Coke. (The reason why the immigration rights thing doesn't constitute an 'indictment against the society' is because it isn't clear that the government is wrong in what it's doing: given the barrenness thing, and if the rest of the world has truly collapsed, as is suggested, then England's immigration policy might be actually fairly sensible policy in order to prevent complete anarchy. It is hardly Orwell's doublethink.)At the end of my longwinded rambling, what I'm trying to say is this: for all of its trappings, this is an action movie. It's a decent action movie, terribly gritty and high-impact, with a dark palette and lots of bleakness and paranoia.While I respect the film, I didn't walk away feeling particularly good about anything (the name of the boat did little to lift my spirits).

646713,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00005JP9X,Doug Anderson,"[6, 9]","Some viewers find this films lack of clarity (its absence of clearly defined themes) to be frustrating but I think Cuaron is purposely leaving things in a tangle because in his (and PD James) future (which is, of course, really the present) things are in a tangle. In Children of Men, as in our world, no one knows who to trust or what to value anymore (except Michael Caine) and this is the feeling Cuaron is attempting to capture. What is frustrating to some critics and moviegoers (some complain that it is never clear just who is fighting who and for what) is really what is drawing others to this film and earning it all kinds of rave reviews because this film seems to tap into the global zeitgesit like no other film has attempted to do since, well, Inarritu's Babel. Both films seem to come from a similarly styled global consciousness that mistrusts rhetoric from the right or from the left and makes its appeal based purely on visceral visuals.Why are the Mexican filmakers so good at thinking in global terms? Hard to say, but maybe for the same reason that the Irish (Wilde, Joyce, Beckett) were so good at thinking in global terms during the last century. Both the Irish of the 1880-1950's and the current Mexican film makers live in the shadow of an opressive empire that seems to think it has the right to call the shots for all humanity. Hubris is always a turn-off (and not just the hubris of the extreme right but also the reactionary hubris of the extreme left). Any kind of national or cultural or other form of hubris perpetuates itself by neutralizing all points of view that challenge or counter its own. What the Irish literary community did in their moment in time is very similar to what the Mexican film community (and by extension the entire international film community) is trying to do now and thats to avoid polarizing political rhetoric and make an appeal based not on an aesthetics & ethics delimited by selfish nationalistic concerns but to create a more global aesthetic & ethics which amounts to nothing less than an attempt to evolve a new phase of humanism. This certainly is an ambitious and utopian project but its what humanism has always attempted to do: extend our vision of what qualifies as humanity in the first place.What we need now are leaders/artists who are also thinkers that understand the limits of any one ""vision"" of what humanity is as well as artists/leaders who understand that each human is going to define themselves in their own way and not according to some nationalistic policy that throws arbitrary borders around property as well as people. For artists like Cuaron the blurring of borders and the mixing of cultures does create confusion and chaos but its a productive and fertile chaos out of which arise new versions of what makes us human in the first place.  Artists are obviously comfortable, even inspired, by chaos. Unfortunatley (some) politicians feel the need to govern it by keeping things neatly compartmentalized: east/west, north/south, first world /third world, empire/colony, center/margin. But the world is becoming less and less compartmentalized every day--its slipping its bounds and its to artists like Cuaron (and Inarritu and Del Toro) that we look to see both what we don't want to happen and what we do.",5,Going Global,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,3294,"['viewers', 'find', 'films', 'lack', 'clarity', 'absence', 'clearly', 'defined', 'themes', 'be', 'frustrating', 'think', 'Cuaron', 'purposely', 'leaving', 'things', 'tangle', 'PD', 'James', 'future', 'course', 'really', 'present', 'things', 'are', 'tangle', 'Children', 'Men', 'world', 'one', 'who', 'trust', 'what', 'value', 'anymore', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'feeling', 'Cuaron', 'attempting', 'capture', 'What', 'frustrating', 'critics', 'moviegoers', 'complain', 'never', 'clear', 'just', 'who', 'fighting', 'who', 'what', 'really', 'what', 'drawing', 'others', 'film', 'earning', 'kinds', 'rave', 'reviews', 'film', 'tap', 'global', 'zeitgesit', 'other', 'film', 'attempted', 'do', 'well', 'Inarritu', 'Babel', 'films', 'seem', 'come', 'similarly', 'styled', 'global', 'consciousness', 'rhetoric', 'right', 'left', 'appeal', 'based', 'purely', 'visceral', 'visuals.Why', 'are', 'Mexican', 'filmakers', 'so', 'good', 'thinking', 'global', 'terms', 'Hard', 'say', 'maybe', 'same', 'reason', 'Irish', 'Wilde', 'Joyce', 'Beckett', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'thinking', 'global', 'terms', 'last', 'century', 'Irish', '1880-1950', 'current', 'Mexican', 'film', 'makers', 'live', 'shadow', 'opressive', 'empire', 'think', 'right', 'call', 'shots', 'humanity', 'Hubris', 'always', 'turn-off', 'not', 'just', 'hubris', 'extreme', 'right', 'also', 'reactionary', 'hubris', 'extreme', 'left', 'kind', 'national', 'cultural', 'other', 'form', 'hubris', 'perpetuates', 'neutralizing', 'points', 'view', 'challenge', 'counter', 'own', 'What', 'Irish', 'literary', 'community', 'did', 'moment', 'time', 'very', 'similar', 'what', 'Mexican', 'film', 'community', 'extension', 'entire', 'international', 'film', 'community', 'trying', 'do', 'now', 'thats', 'avoid', 'polarizing', 'political', 'rhetoric', 'make', 'appeal', 'based', 'not', 'aesthetics', 'ethics', 'delimited', 'selfish', 'nationalistic', 'concerns', 'create', 'more', 'global', 'aesthetic', 'ethics', 'amounts', 'nothing', 'less', 'attempt', 'evolve', 'new', 'phase', 'humanism', 'certainly', 'ambitious', 'utopian', 'project', 'what', 'humanism', 'always', 'attempted', 'do', 'extend', 'vision', 'what', 'humanity', 'first', 'need', 'now', 'are', 'leaders/artists', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'thinkers', 'understand', 'limits', 'one', 'vision', 'what', 'humanity', 'as', 'well', 'artists/leaders', 'who', 'understand', 'human', 'going', 'define', 'own', 'way', 'not', 'according', 'nationalistic', 'policy', 'arbitrary', 'borders', 'around', 'property', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'artists', 'Cuaron', 'blurring', 'borders', 'mixing', 'cultures', 'create', 'confusion', 'chaos', 'productive', 'fertile', 'chaos', 'arise', 'new', 'versions', 'what', 'human', 'first', 'place', 'Artists', 'are', 'obviously', 'comfortable', 'even', 'inspired', 'chaos', 'Unfortunatley', 'politicians', 'feel', 'need', 'govern', 'keeping', 'things', 'neatly', 'compartmentalized', 'east/west', 'north/south', 'first', 'world', '/third', 'world', 'empire/colony', 'center/margin', 'world', 'becoming', 'less', 'less', 'compartmentalized', 'day', 'slipping', 'bounds', 'artists', 'Cuaron', 'Inarritu', 'Del', 'Toro', 'look', 'see', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'happen', 'what', 'do']",N/A

Incoherent plot, failure to provide any reasonable explanation for the  situation into which the characters are thrust, and, oh,  many more; nonetheless, I  was grabbed by the movie and involved in the characters if not in the plotline. In other words,  the whole was much better than its parts or the sum of its parts.  That's good enough for me. Clive Owen was entirely credible even if his character was inexplicable, Michael Caine and Julianne Moore performed ably in small parts, and a number of people I never heard of and cannot remember by name  were quite good in their roles (particularly the mother of the first child to be born into the world in, I think it was, 18 years). Despite the murkiness behind the actions, all the viewer has to know is that  no new children are being born, Government military is  rounding up refugees and mistreating them, rebels are set on engaging in violent action to defeat the military and free refugees, and, in the midst of all this, the mother-to-be, now in the hands of the rebels, who want to use her baby symbolically, thinks she is  on  her way to an outside organization which would care for both she and her baby. It is never very clear why anyone is doing what they are doing, but with this kind of program to the  action, it hardly makes any difference.Not recommended for people who need all their i's dotted and t's crossed.

I was blown away by this incredible movie and would even say it was one of the best movies of last year. There's a reason this movie was nominated for its cinematography and editing and you can see it in every beautifully framed shot.The movie centers on Theo (Clive Owen), a man who has lost his family and only floats along now in the nightmare the world has become since children can no longer be conceived and everything has turned to chaos. It's not until  his estranged wife, who is the leader of an extremist group, contacts him for help in getting a young woman who is pregnant out of the country. Though reluctant at first, Theo decides to help and becomes caught up in an electrifying race against time, filled with incredible action sequences, back-stabbing and a small glimmer of hope for the future.The movie excels at everything it tries to accomplish. The story and plot move along briskly. The acting is top notch, with Clive Owen being the most notable. He continues to impress me with his roles and acting. Alfonso's vision of a destroyed future world is perfect and the sets are great. If you're a true fan of film and pay attention to how movies are shot, the action scenes alone will make you fall in love with this movie. During the big action scenes Alfonso doesn't make a single cut. You'll see people being shot, entire car chases with fire and mobs, running out of exploding buildings and through buses as a war rages in the background.

646719,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JP9X,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 7]","Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n lends both scarifying grit and unexpected heart to this propulsive, rewarding 2006 screen adaptation of P.D. James' 1992 dystopian sci-fi novel about a hopeless future with no children. There have been many apocalyptic films that deal with Armageddon in many different forms, yet this one reverberates from a most plangent storyline of global collapse as Cuar&oacute;n thoughtfully brings it down to a human-size scale. Set in England only twenty years hence, the film shows a relentlessly bleak landscape not too far imagined from the present. Cuar&oacute;n manages to tether us to the fantastical story by making 2027 London look realistically desultory and shell-shocked with its faded double-deckers and Bangkok-style tuk-tuks. In turn, the Bexhill refugee camp later in the film has a startling resemblance to the Abu Ghraib prison and the surrounding streets a dead ringer for the shots of violent warfare we are used to seeing in Iraq on CNN.The plot centers on Theo Faron, a former political activist who has been numbed into apathy by the increasingly nihilistic state of the planet. Because its isolated island geography has ensured the success of an emerging fascist government, Great Britain has become the only nation to survive the worldwide nuclear terrorism. Foreigners are automatically labeled illegal immigrants and placed in brutalizing internment camps, and at 18, the youngest person on the planet has just been stabbed to death. The news is devastating to the masses because infertility has plagued the planet for nearly two decades with no hope for the human race to survive. Kidnapped by the Fishes, a revolutionary group supporting the foreigners' human rights, Theo finds out the dastardly act was masterminded by his ex-wife Julian, who heads the group. Her motivation becomes clear as they are holding a West African girl named Kee, who happens to be eight months pregnant. The rest of the film focuses on the clandestine effort to transport Kee to the Human Project, an offshore organization dedicated to reversing the global infertility.There are so many strong visual cues and unexpected plot turns that it is impossible to be bored by the story penned by no less than five screenwriters including Cuar&oacute;n. A powerful example is the meticulous portrayal of Theo's cousin Nigel, the one official who can secure travel documents for Kee's passage, as the curator of the world's surviving masterworks (including Michelangelo's damaged David and Picasso's Guernica) in the reconverted Tate Modern. Another is the superb cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, richly textured in establishing the bombed-out, authoritarian universe and documentary-like once the more violent aspects take over the movie. Particularly impressive is the extended scene where the Fishes attempt to escape an aggressive ambush in a speeding car, as well as the concluding battle scenes which culminate into an unexpected religious allegory.After his scene-stealing turns in ""Closer"" and ""Inside Man"", Clive Owen really owns this movie from start to finish with a richly complex portrait of a man who discovers his sense of purpose against seemingly insurmountable odds. In fact, his committed performance holds together some of the more far-fetched plot developments like Theo's too-easy escape from the safe house. Claire-Hope Ashitey provides a striking presence as the vulnerable but amazingly resilient Kee. Also making vivid impressions are the reliable Julianne Moore as Julian, Chiwetel Ejiofor as fellow revolutionary Luke, Danny Huston as Nigel, Pam Ferris as Kee's self-appointed guardian Miriam (who provides an essential back story behind the infertility), Peter Mullan as the corrupt policeman Syd, and an especially colorful Michael Caine as Theo's perpetually quixotic friend Jasper. This is nicely audacious filmmaking, a creative masterstroke that marks Cuar&oacute;n as an important creative force in cinema.",5,Precarious Balance Between Nihilism and Hope Captured with Bravado by Cuar&oacute;n,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,3965,"['Director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'scarifying', 'grit', 'unexpected', 'heart', 'propulsive', 'rewarding', '2006', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'P.D', 'James', '1992', 'dystopian', 'sci-fi', 'novel', 'hopeless', 'future', 'children', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'apocalyptic', 'films', 'deal', 'Armageddon', 'many', 'different', 'forms', 'yet', 'one', 'most', 'plangent', 'storyline', 'global', 'collapse', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'thoughtfully', 'down', 'human-size', 'scale', 'Set', 'England', 'only', 'twenty', 'years', 'hence', 'film', 'relentlessly', 'bleak', 'landscape', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'imagined', 'present', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'tether', 'fantastical', 'story', 'making', '2027', 'London', 'look', 'realistically', 'desultory', 'shell-shocked', 'faded', 'double-deckers', 'Bangkok-style', 'tuk-tuks', 'turn', 'Bexhill', 'refugee', 'camp', 'later', 'film', 'startling', 'resemblance', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'prison', 'surrounding', 'streets', 'dead', 'ringer', 'shots', 'violent', 'warfare', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'Iraq', 'CNN.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'Theo', 'Faron', 'former', 'political', 'activist', 'who', 'been', 'numbed', 'apathy', 'increasingly', 'nihilistic', 'state', 'planet', 'isolated', 'island', 'geography', 'ensured', 'success', 'emerging', 'fascist', 'government', 'Great', 'Britain', 'become', 'only', 'nation', 'survive', 'worldwide', 'nuclear', 'terrorism', 'Foreigners', 'are', 'automatically', 'labeled', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'placed', 'brutalizing', 'internment', 'camps', '18', 'youngest', 'person', 'planet', 'just', 'been', 'stabbed', 'death', 'news', 'devastating', 'masses', 'infertility', 'plagued', 'planet', 'nearly', 'two', 'decades', 'hope', 'human', 'race', 'survive', 'Kidnapped', 'Fishes', 'revolutionary', 'group', 'supporting', 'foreigners', 'human', 'rights', 'Theo', 'out', 'dastardly', 'act', 'was', 'masterminded', 'ex-wife', 'Julian', 'who', 'group', 'motivation', 'clear', 'are', 'holding', 'West', 'African', 'girl', 'named', 'Kee', 'who', 'be', 'eight', 'months', 'pregnant', 'rest', 'film', 'clandestine', 'effort', 'transport', 'Kee', 'Human', 'Project', 'offshore', 'organization', 'dedicated', 'reversing', 'global', 'infertility.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'strong', 'visual', 'cues', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'impossible', 'be', 'bored', 'story', 'penned', 'less', 'five', 'screenwriters', 'including', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'powerful', 'example', 'meticulous', 'portrayal', 'Theo', 'cousin', 'Nigel', 'one', 'official', 'who', 'can', 'secure', 'travel', 'documents', 'Kee', 'passage', 'curator', 'world', 'surviving', 'masterworks', 'including', 'Michelangelo', 'damaged', 'David', 'Picasso', 'Guernica', 'reconverted', 'Tate', 'Modern', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'Emmanuel', 'Lubezki', 'richly', 'textured', 'establishing', 'bombed-out', 'authoritarian', 'universe', 'documentary-like', 'once', 'more', 'violent', 'aspects', 'take', 'movie', 'Particularly', 'impressive', 'extended', 'scene', 'where', 'Fishes', 'attempt', 'escape', 'aggressive', 'ambush', 'speeding', 'car', 'as', 'well', 'concluding', 'battle', 'scenes', 'culminate', 'unexpected', 'religious', 'allegory.After', 'scene-stealing', 'turns', 'Closer', 'Inside', 'Man', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'really', 'movie', 'start', 'finish', 'richly', 'complex', 'portrait', 'man', 'who', 'sense', 'purpose', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'fact', 'committed', 'performance', 'together', 'more', 'far-fetched', 'plot', 'developments', 'Theo', 'too-easy', 'escape', 'safe', 'house', 'Claire-Hope', 'Ashitey', 'striking', 'presence', 'vulnerable', 'amazingly', 'resilient', 'Kee', 'Also', 'making', 'vivid', 'impressions', 'are', 'reliable', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Julian', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'fellow', 'revolutionary', 'Luke', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'Nigel', 'Pam', 'Ferris', 'Kee', 'self-appointed', 'guardian', 'Miriam', 'who', 'essential', 'back', 'story', 'infertility', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'corrupt', 'policeman', 'Syd', 'especially', 'colorful', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Theo', 'perpetually', 'quixotic', 'friend', 'Jasper', 'nicely', 'audacious', 'filmmaking', 'creative', 'masterstroke', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'important', 'creative', 'force', 'cinema']",N/A
646720,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00005JP9X,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","CHILDREN OF MEN (director Alfonso Cuaron, 2006) is one of my favorite films, and shows just how far we've come thanks to films like it. It wasn't that long ago I saw this, was stunned by its originality and celebration of life. I've wanted to review this for so long, but it vanished so quickly, I only saw it once, thus I could never recall its name or who was in it!Thelonious ""Theo"" Faron (Clive Owen) is a sort of alcoholic numbskull suffering from shattered dreams and 20 years of lonely misery. It is circa 2028, very clever because the terrible blight on humanity began in 2008. Theo, who lost a daughter that he had with fellow radical activist Julian (Julianne Moore), is interested only in drinking.Suddenly, Julian contacts him. She wants him to escort someone out of England (presumably - it's a murky storyline and that is not good). Before he can agree or disagree, he's up to his neck in the transportation of a young Ghanaian immigrant named Kee (the beautiful Clare-Hope Ashitey) who is I believe 18 years old.This is a future without children, a totalitarian, mean, rotten future that deserves to die off - Britain's borders have been closed nearly a decade, and immigrants get the NAZI treatment. The women all suddenly became barren - and no one knows why. Kee is one of the last teenagers on earth AND an illegal immigrant. Everyone else is, well, over-the-hill and either British or illegal.I know the feeling, and can commiserate with the illegal immigrants.Our sweet young Ghanaian, Kee, is pregnant. This is not only a miracle, it is unbelievable to the characters. (Theo asks Kee who the father of the baby is, and for a brief, tense moment, she teases him and says there was no father. Hilarious!)There is an important new group of radicals called the ""Fishes"" - they ought to have been called the ""Fish"" because an individual is called a ""Fish"". Native-born British women are called ""Cod"". Headed by the semi-villainous Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the Fishes are fighting the totalitarian government. What they really want is Kee's baby to use almost as a weapon.The rest I will not spoil. This film is stunning not only for its socio-philosophical depth; the effects are a marvel no other director has matched. Sine I paid no attention to credits, I assume Cuaron shot much of this as well as directing. It is the best, most mind-boggling cinematography I've seen. Cuaron weaves, ducks and runs with the camera like an on-the-spot disaster report, but he does it so naturally, so smoothly, that there isn't even any vertigo. Your eyes will follow this naturally.My HUGE pet peeve with all modern film is the damnable 'wobbly-camera' syndrome. Cuar&oacute;n has something to teach the world about using this technique CORRECTLY. Where he picked it up, I have no idea - all I know is that Cuaron is jockeying to become one of our greatest directors. I think we can take that to the bank.The cast of this film is a delight: Michael Caine does a cameo as Theo's ancient hippie friend Jasper (I love the running joke about Jasper's latest invention: ""Strawberry Cough"" marijuana) -  note this was a kind of comeback for Caine. The gorgeous Charlie Hunnam is Patric, one of the Fishes and a nasty one at that. Pam Ferris is Miriam, a New Age nun who travels with Theo and Kee, and this is a very interesting character I quite loved.Danny Huston as (the instrumental cameo) Nigel, Jacek Koman as Tomasz, and the great Peter Mullan as Syd round out this terrific cast. Now ... don't go looking for a whole lot of background explanation or in-depth dialogue. The clues as to what is occurring are all around you, very little referred to in dialogue which I think is brilliant - but it can be a headache since nothing is clearly explained.Usually with this in-the-near-future type story, we want to know how that future descends from our time. Rarely do we get it. At least here, Cuaron ahs given us a one-line explanation: women are barren and no one knows why. The effects of that are catastrophic, as you will see abundantly in this brilliant and sadly forgotten film.Aside from some action-violence (should be studied in film school) and if you can somehow tune out the occasional swearing, this is a great family film (definitely not for the very young, teens on up, I think). It's so gorgeous and thought-provoking that you have to have the violence ... otherwise, how can the lesson be taught?One last thing: while the religious people (there are few) are either New Wave or Catholic, there is no special significance to the prayer/greeting ""Shanti, Shanti, Shanti"". ""Shanti"" is Sanskrit/Hindu for ""peace"", so it is like saying ""Shalom"". The New Wave folk pray the ancient Hindu Shanti prayer (for so it is) - and that's all. Make of that what you will. Interestingly, the Catholics cross themselves.Get this and enjoy it over and over - it is a classic you'll regret not buying.",5,"World without children, beautiful dissonance",1301270400,"03 28,

How is it possible to start with such a gripping idea and result in a film so slow and dull, devoid of drama and excitement? There was no pacing, no heart, no great dialog, nothing that brought me into the story and caused me to empathize with the characters. Before I put the DVD into my player, I cared deeply about the concept of the story, but I couldn't sustain that interest while watching Cuar&oacute;n's rendition of it.Quite a few reviewers are positioning this film as an ""art film"" and as a ""masterpiece,"" and some fans are posting scathing comments on one-star reviews implying or even saying outright that those who hate this film are lacking in culture and education. I would like to say in response to this that it is possible to love art films and dislike this film intensely. I am a huge fan of art film in general but this film was not to my taste--nor would I even have thought to put it in the art film category at all.In an art film I look for amazing visuals, brilliant editing, great dialog, marriage of music and images. When one or all of those factors are present, I don't care if the plot is not fleshed out or paced well. In fact, if I'm entranced enough by the images, I don't hardly need a plot at all to make me happy! Here, and I know it's a matter of taste, but personally the images did nothing for me. They were the visual equivalent for me of overracting...just too overdone--like someone was shouting, 'hey, you see it? it's dank and dismal and these people are miserable."" For me, emotional impact is highest when there's more subtlety and less pandering. From my perspective, Children of Men succeeded neither as Hollywood fluff nor as an art film.For those who like to know if reviewers have compatible tastes to their own, I'll say my favorite dystopian film of all time is Gattaca. I was gripped from the first scene until the final credits rolled. For film in general, my favorite living director is Almod&oacute;var.

Indeed, unlike a lot of sci-fi films nowadays, ""Children of Men"" does not shy away from making dystopia realistic and grisly. Key characters are killed suddenly, the color palate is mainly grey, and all of the key characters have traits that make them less than admirable. In one chilling scene, an important character is last shown being taken away by troops with a hood over her head, which is the last we see of her.The film could have really been a sci-fi hit had it not been so pointless. It lacks focus and the plot never really grabs the viewer's interest. A lot of important relationships and plot twists are left unexplained. We never learn why women become infertile or why immigrants are treated so badly, except perhaps that this is a dystopia. Unlike Blade Runner, the movie had no insightful moment or moral revelation. Rather than provoking thought, the film's end seems too hollywood for the genre.I like the style of dystopia, the basic idea by P.D. James, and the cinematography, but the plot (which should be the heart of the film) is just not strong enough. I found myself bored during the film and frankly not caring about the characters or the outcome. I would give the director another shot at a sci-fi dystopia, but with a tighter story-line.",2,"Realistic dystopian vision, but lacks focus",1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,1411,"['first', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'noire', 'mold', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'dystopian', 'society', 'women', 'lack', 'fertility', 'Indeed', 'lot', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'nowadays', 'Children', 'Men', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'making', 'dystopia', 'realistic', 'grisly', 'Key', 'characters', 'are', 'killed', 'suddenly', 'color', 'palate', 'mainly', 'grey', 'key', 'characters', 'have', 'traits', 'make', 'less', 'admirable', 'one', 'chilling', 'scene', 'important', 'character', 'last', 'shown', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'troops', 'hood', 'head', 'last', 'see', 'her.The', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'sci-fi', 'hit', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'pointless', 'focus', 'plot', 'never', 'really', 'grabs', 'viewer', 'interest', 'lot', 'important', 'relationships', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'left', 'unexplained', 'never', 'learn', 'why', 'women', 'become', 'infertile', 'why', 'immigrants', 'are', 'treated', 'so', 'badly', 'perhaps', 'dystopia', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'movie', 'had', 'insightful', 'moment', 'moral', 'revelation', 'Rather', 'provoking', 'thought', 'film', 'end', 'too', 'hollywood', 'genre.I', 'style', 'dystopia', 'basic', 'idea', 'P.D', 'James', 'cinematography', 'plot', 'should', 'be', 'heart', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'found', 'bored', 'film', 'frankly', 'not', 'caring', 'characters', 'outcome', 'would', 'give', 'director', 'shot', 'sci-fi', 'dystopia', 'tighter', 'story-line']",N/A

One need only watch 12 MONKEYS, V FOR VENDETTA, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK or even A CLOCKWORK ORANGE to see where the original ideas came from.And finally, as for the critic's opinion that CHILDREN OF MEN is ""Blade Runner for the 21st Century""...what exactly was this person smoking when they said that??  To even come close to the genius of BLADE RUNNER, there would have to be some special effects which depict a city of the future.  There are none.

These guys make Al Gore look like a gushing optimist.

In fact, for major parts of the film, it's easy to forget that there are no more children, as Cuaron seems more interested in making obvious and heavy-handed references to contemporary events such as Abu Ghraib, illegal immigration, the public reaction to the death of Princess Di, the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, etc. It's never explained how the fertility crisis is connected to the chaos in Europe and Asia that has sent hordes of refugees to Great Britain (nor why the semi-fascist government that is so intent on rounding up refugees in internment camps allowed them into the country in the first place), but it certainly provides an opportunity for one of the most visually stunning and meticulously realized fictional worlds I have ever seen on film.

That should not be. 4 or 5 star movies should only be movies of superb quality. Rotten Tomatoes awards this movie with a 94%. The end result, for me, was a very disappointing and misleading review.This movie is not the worst movie in the world but for the sole reason of it being dull and boring, it deserves 1 or 2 stars. I thought the acting in the movie was horrible. There were hardly any emotions in the movie. One guy, Jasper, gets shot 3 times before he dies. Each time he gets shot he says ""pull my finger."" Most people would be in pain, but that is just me. Additionally, the movie itself was just dragged out. It does not help that hardly anything was explained. A town world full of terrorism and infertility? Well how did this occur and why?I was also disappointed, as some indicated, that this plot was very straight forward and did not go into the direction many ""1 star reviewers"" wanted it to go. In fact, this movie was almost a rip off of Escape from New York. Escape from New York reserved Manhattan for prisoners. In return, a lot of chaos and destruction occurred there. The story then focuses on the president being held hostage by prisoners and will only release him if all of the prisoners are pardonend. In other words they are trying to get out.Children of Men starts off with a corrupted city. Perhaps they did not want to talk about it in depth because it would become reminiscent to Escape from New York. However, it is similar in that a lady has a baby, something no other woman can have. Likewise, a particular group is aware of this and wants to steal the baby for politcal gain. The same concept that they, too, want to escape the hell hole.Finally, at the end of the movie all of the terrorism briefly stops as the woman with her child walks through the town. A good ending? I think it is contradicting. Everyone would potentially want that baby so they, too, could better their lives. I doubt they would stare in amazement. Also their is a point where Clive Owen and several other invididuals are wanted for killing officers. At one point they are being transported on a bus. The police sees all of them but does nothing.

646736,A1PN3R8DXRQ1C3,B00005JP9X,Gary Malone,"[1, 7]","""Children of Men"" was film of the year for me. It was clever, thought-provoking, action-packed and brilliantly acted by seasoned performers. Particularly amazing were the two chase scenes that were filmed in one continuous shot. So you would think that if the filmmakers went to the trouble of releasing a two-disc edition of the film, they would explain how those two key sequences were filmed. Wrong.Instead, much of the space that could have been devoted to this was wasted on the verbal meanderings of ... Slavoj Zizek, an over-earnest ""cultural theorist"" who had nothing whatever to do with the making of the film. Zizek is one those fashionably oblique academics given to making sweepingly counter-intuitive statements in broken English. My favourite is his definition of a good film:""It simply make reality the more what it already is"".On and on he drones, chicly quoting Hegel while explaining that ""the film gives the best diagnosis of ideological despair of late capitalism"" or that the movie instantiates ""the paradox of what I would call anamorphosis"" (as opposed to ""what I would call the paradox of anamorphosis""). At one point he refers to Michelangelo's ""David"" as ""a statue of Michelangelo or whatever"". But what else should we expect from the man who recently appeared on ""Democracy Now"" to declare that ""let's everybody in the world, except US citizens, be allowed to vote and elect the American government""? Sigh ...So: caveat emptor. The movie itself is truly brilliant, but the second disc is a let-down. I didn't want to hear a block of ""theory"": I wanted to know more about the making of the film. I suspect that others who really adored this film feel the same way.

The movie is about violence and the heavy toll our violent nature has wrought on our civilization. If we insist on killing and warfare, then exactly what is the point of us women having children, bringing them into a world that is not ready to accept their right to exist in peace? That's the underlying question of the movie.Every woman in a position to have children asks herself, or should, if it's the right thing to do and if this world is a terrible place to bring a child into, or do the good and beautiful things outweigh human tragedy and atrocities? What if we women decided to go on strike? Would that change the men in power?Children of Men is a moving and powerful movie about how we treat each other in the here and now and about the role that violence plays in our life path on this planet.

646741,A21CFAK6J6H2UI,B00005JP9X,Goatface Killah,"[3, 4]","At twelve o'clock (in SF) on weekdays an interview program comes on PBS called ""The Charlie Rose Show.""  A couple days before Christmas, three Mexican directors were on the show: Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, and Guillermo del Toro.  Mostly they talked about their friendship and how they sometimes collaborate on each others' films, and they also talked about their newest films; ""Babel"" (I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu), ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (Del Toro), and ""Children of Men"" (Cuar&oacute;n).  The latter film interested me the most from the clips that were showcased and what Cuar&oacute;n said about the film.  The most intriguing thing he mentioned was that he preferred not to do close-ups to create the drama, but that he liked to back off and let the actors make their own, real drama, instead of having to synthesize it.Subsequently I went to see ""Children of Men,"" right before school reconvened, and not only does Cuar&oacute;n accomplish that, but he manages to make everything seem as though it is actually happening, that you are looking though a screen into a real world.  Everything that happens fits into that world and expands its realm beyond the plot line.  Part of how he accomplishes that is the details that Cuar&oacute;n inserts, such as cynical comments graffitied on walls, and advertising for a commercial suicide drink called ""Quietus"" accompanied with the slogan ""You decide when it's time.""  Another impressive aspect of this movie, for not many directors are able to do this well, is the cinematography.  Cuar&oacute;n pulls off myriad styles of shooting such as steady-cam shots, scenes where the camera is off-center, hand-held camera work, and an incredible nine minute shot with no cuts, that maintains the suspense of the shot masterfully.One of the best scenes is the opening scene which is brilliantly done, for Cuar&oacute;n establishes the setting and the tone of the movie within the first minute.  It starts out with a blank screen and a voice announcing the death of the world's youngest person, aged 18, for no one has been born since 2009 due to the infertility of all women in the world.  Then suddenly an image appears of a crowded coffee shop with everyone looking up at a television, which bears the sad tidings.  You then see Theo (Clive Owen) enter the coffee shop and start pushing through the crowd to order a coffee.  He momentarily looks up at the screen, then takes his coffee and walks outside, with a subtitle at the bottom of the screen proclaiming the date to be November 2027 in London.  He walks down the street a little and stops to put some alcohol in his coffee as the camera circles around him, when the coffee shop he was just in explodes, and a woman walks out holding her severed arm right before the screen turns black, and the title of the film is displayed in bold, white letters.From that first scene the tone is set, and details begin to be filled in when metro trains are attacked by angry rioters, piles of dead cattle are seen aflame in the countryside, signifying the continuous presence of mad cow disease in England, and cages filled with illegal immigrants can be seen everywhere, even on platforms for the Underground (the British metro rail).  The only escape from the outside world is in Theo's friend Jasper's house, hidden away in the woods off of the highway somewhere in the countryside.  The story progresses as Theo is abducted by an underground group called ""The Fishes,"" led now by his ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore).  She asks him to obtain transit papers for a girl in exchange for five thousand pounds.  He declines at first, but later decides to do it, and gets the transit papers from his cousin who works for the government.  After that, the situation gets worse and worse as Theo begins to find out the whole truth.While the movie is extremely enjoyable, the plot obviously isn't pertinent to life nowadays, unlike other sophisticated films, such as ""The Constant Gardener,"" (excellent film), and ""Syriana.""  However, the movie manages to address many topics that are relevant to today without obstructing the flow of the film, such as the issues of illegal immigration, cruel and unusual punishment, and to a smaller degree the quality of our food, which has become a bigger issue since the recent outbreaks of e coli poisoning.Most of the aspects that make this movie good I have mentioned in passing, but what truly makes this movie great is how it all comes together.  Everything; the details, the acting, the special effects, the camera work, all come together and function beautifully in regards to each other.  This is a unifying aspect of all movies that are considered to be masterpieces of film making.  The Lord of the Rings Trilogy would never have been considered a great epic if the acting and the special effects had not been so unified, nor would any of Akira Kurosawa's films have been so wonderful if he had not had such excellent actors and plot lines to work with.  I definitely recommend seeing this movie, for this truly is an example of great film making, and seeing Clive Owen at work is always a pleasure.",5,"Last One To Die, Please Turn Out The

What is even more impressive about that is that this particular story incorporates many elements which are commonly seen in feature films focusing on dramatic fight scenes, explosions, and the like.  I also felt that the film had a similar quality in many ways to a well-composed video game, with a singular consistent drive toward a goal which is distributed amongst more episodic moments.  There is a sense of suspense which is snapped in unexpected ways multiple times so, just when you think the film might turn cliched and predictable, it morphs sharply.  The action keeps things moving quickly but the emotional, psychological, and philosophical elements are not lost in the rush.

646744,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JP9X,Grady Harp,"[5, 7]","CHILDREN OF MEN is a masterpiece of cinematic artistry. Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, using a screenplay he co-wrote with Timothy J. Sexton, has done what few artists have been able to achieve before - create an apocalyptic experience that is almost devoid of extraneous material meant to terrify the audience and focused the worst of unthinkable events into a personal story about a few people. Oh, the global destruction and masses of dead humanity are not kept from our eyes, but instead Cuar&oacute;n uses these horrid images as a background for a story about the changes than can occur in each of us when our souls and lives are challenged by extinction.The story is set in 2027 and the only country that has survived some unnamed disaster is England (importantly, the only country without a constitution, maintaining its governance on history). The landscape is bleak, twisted, filthy and holds scattered cages of fugitives (immigrants from the countries no longer in existence): it is difficult to decide which is better, being dead or living in this heinous mess of a wasted world. Society is on the brink of extinction as the people are infertile and the youngest living person has just died. We meet Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a drunken bored disillusioned detritus of a man whose early years were alive with political activism. He loathes his meaningless job and he is bitter and utterly disillusioned and emotionally numb. A group called 'Angels' is lead by Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore), Theo's former significant other with whom he had a child that died of influenza, and Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and their work is the protection of immigrants as well as transporting a young black girl Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) who happens to be pregnant(!) to a sea spot where Human Project will aid her in propagating a new society. Julian has Theo captured (he is the only man she can truly trust) to handle the safe transportation of Kee to the Human Project.Theo at first refuses to absorb this new direction but incidents occur which change his mind: he receives sound advice and encouragement from an old hippie friend Jasper (Michael Caine) and the trek begins. The bond between Kee and Theo is an increasingly strong one and as they follow directions that are in code they gradually discover the incentives of various people to follow the eventual birth of the first child to be born in eighteen years. The trip is harrowing, suspenseful, filled with psychological and philosophical implications, and the ending of this tale occurs in the foggy mists of the sea aboard a tiny boat - a place that has no roots.Clive Owen is mesmerizing in this tough role and his support from Moore, Caine, Ejiofor, Ashitey, as well as smaller roles played by such fine actors as Charlie Hunnam, Pam Ferris, Danny Huston, Peter Mullan, Oana Pellea and Jacek Koman to mention only a few is on the highest level. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is miraculous, capturing a strange world that seems very real yet not absurdly over the edge. Classical composer John Tavener (with help from Mahler, Penderecki, and others) finds just the right balance between old folk songs, contemporary requiem moments and excerpts from popular music of the past to mold a fascinating musical score: it works! Some may avoid this film because of the apparent disturbing content, but for this viewer this film speaks so cogently to the matters we should all heed to help reverse some of the destruction we have done to our world that it would be hard to imagine this film not changing people's views on immigration as an example of how confused is our sense of humanity, and that is only one issue before us. CHILDREN OF MEN is an instant classic, whether we like it or not. Highly Recommended.

When Vendetta came out, critics stomped it with criticism; they said the film had a shoddy conclusion and the decisions made by the protagonist were bought under scrutiny. There is no such protagonist in Children Of Men yet it is similar. Britain is a power in this movie again but then one might ask, what's the use when there is such a sense of uneasiness going on - around the world? Clive Own earns a lot of respect. His act is solid. There is no doubt that the action scenes in this film will make you wonder what hit you. To some, this film might appear  a bit ""over the top"" and to some, it might make perfectly skewed sense. CHILDREN OF MEN has a scene that stops your breath and makes your eyes go wide when your mind is telling you, ""That's impossible"" but yes, that where it sets itself apart.The best scenes in the film involves cars,on foot chases, men on the verge of insanity and utter dismay at one's helplessness. The direction tells us that power is ultimately sought. While Vendetta was based on a totalitarian form of government, Children Of Men takes a more conservative yet forward approach. Countries are fighting among themselves wondering why a woman can't give birth anymore. The storyline is good but the action and overall impact is quite staggering,really. The music of the film is worth remembering though not all tracks are found in the soundtrack. Why 4 stars, you might ask. I thought the film could have been longer (perhaps the editing could have been more generous) and I had difficulty understanding what was being said by a few characters.This is as good as Vendetta was, in my opinion, if not better.

Normally, grim apocalyptic fables do not draw me because ""bleak"" and ""depressing"" don't constitute my idea of entertainment.  However, most bleak, depressing, apocalyptic fables do not star Clive Owen.  I would sit through the driest of actuarial company training videos if it were delivered by Mr. Owen, so I was willing to give this a try.  According to various rumor mills, Mr. Owen was either passed over for the role of 007 in ""Casino Royale"" or turned it down due to his commitment to this project.  He does good work as another kind of reluctant action hero here, and not unlike Bond, the fate of the world rests on the success of his mission.  Owen will not achieve Bond-like status on the basis of this movie or any other, but the autonomy to choose a wide range of disparate roles is its own reward.  With his trademark underplayed style of acting, he has been compared to such laconic American icons as Gary Cooper & Steve McQueen, but in this movie he reminded me of no one so much as James Stewart.  A similar Hitchcockian Everyman-in-a-bad-fix dynamic is at work as Owen's depressed protaganist Theo, made passive by drink and by the sorrowful events surrounding him, is suddenly thrust into action against his will and discovers the hero within. If you like shoot-em-up, crash 'em-up futuristic thrillers like ""Mad Max"" or ""Blade Runner"", you'll find plenty to like here.  Even if you don't, you won't be able to take your eyes off Clive.

At first, it would get mentioned in a list of upcoming films, then the lists of upcoming films with interesting premises. Finally, there were whole articles about it, about how the filmmaker was doing something unique and interesting and that the plot (people can't have babies, man has to escort the first pregnant woman to safety) was where the film took off into a superlative experience.I can attest to this. Children of Men is amazing. The best parts are the details of this dystopian future where despair has permeated everything. Britain is the last bastion of civilization, a place where everyone knows there will be no one left alive in a century and that everything anyone does is doomed not only to failure but to be forgotten and buried.The cinematography was unreal. In one place, there is a single scene shot inside a car. It is done in 1 take and it is breathtaking. How is it possible for so much to happen in a single take would be amazing. I'd have thought the filmmaker got unbelieveably lucky, except he does it AGAIN later in the movie and does it even better in the middle of a full blown battle scene. I wish I could italicize the last sentence. This movie may represent the best example of telling a story using the full filmmaking palette that I've ever seen, a directorial command unseen since Orson Welles' Citzen Kane. That sounds pretty high faluting, except that I think I liked Children of Men better.The actors do a terrific job. Michael Caine pops up, as does Julianne Moore. Both are more than competent but the movie belongs to Clive Owen. There was some noise a while back about Clive being the new James Bond, the role that ultimately went to Daniel Craig. It was a great movie...which may have been greater with Clive in the part.Last, the marketing campaign for Children of Men was really not well done. I read movie magazines all the time.

Rather than repeat what others have already said, let me raise one plot point which makes no sense to me. Early in the movie a big deal is made about the need for the protagonist to obtain two travel passes so he can escort a girl from London to Brighton. This is a fascist dystopia with strict travel control regulations, let us not forget. So Clive Owen's character visits his rich  influential brother to ask for the really big favor of obtaining two travel passes.The next thing we see is Clive, the girl and 3 other people heading down the road in a car.

This is only the backdrop, though.  The main story centers around the theme that for approximately 18 years, not one woman in the world has been able to conceive due to some unknown mass infertility amongst humans.  One woman, however has become pregnant, and is taken into secretive care to be transported to a safe haven no one really is sure exists.  One man, (Clive Owen) has become a reluctant guide (even though he doesn't know what he is doing either) and the rest of the movie takes place around the extreme events to get this woman to the safe haven.The events compare and contrast the evils people will do amongst a world like this and the good that still would remain.  The settings are bleak, but the goodness among the main characters contrasts this.  What I really like about this movie is it may appear to be the end of the world, but the movie gives a bit of hope in a mysterious way as to leave you satisfied, but vague enough to create your own conclusions.A great movie in which you may take away some lessons, but it's mainly just an entertaining watch.",4,"A Bleak, Infertile Existence with a Touch of Hope",1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,1263,"['movie', 'place', 'future', 'England', 'still', 'trying', 'maintain', 'hold', 'civilization', 'when', 'much', 'rest', 'world', 'been', 'seemingly', 'turned', 'chaotic', 'destroyed', 'only', 'backdrop', 'though', 'main', 'story', 'centers', 'theme', 'approximately', '18', 'years', 'not', 'one', 'woman', 'world', 'been', 'able', 'conceive', 'due', 'unknown', 'mass', 'infertility', 'amongst', 'humans', 'One', 'woman', 'however', 'become', 'pregnant', 'taken', 'secretive', 'care', 'be', 'transported', 'safe', 'haven', 'one', 'really', 'sure', 'exists', 'One', 'man', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'become', 'reluctant', 'guide', 'even', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'rest', 'movie', 'place', 'extreme', 'events', 'get', 'woman', 'safe', 'haven.The', 'events', 'compare', 'contrast', 'evils', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'amongst', 'world', 'good', 'still', 'would', 'remain', 'settings', 'are', 'bleak', 'goodness', 'main', 'characters', 'What', 'really', 'like', 'movie', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'end', 'world', 'movie', 'bit', 'hope', 'mysterious', 'way', 'leave', 'satisfied', 'vague', 'enough', 'create', 'own', 'conclusions.A', 'great', 'movie', 'may', 'take', 'away', 'lessons', 'mainly', 'just', 'entertaining', 'watch']",N/A

646754,A17RG4CS9EYYUS,B00005JP9X,"hydrophilic ""hydrophilic""","[0, 1]","In many ways, ""Children of Men"" is a very typical futuristic thriller. It of course extrapolates the current worries of our time into a dystopian nightmare of tomorrow. World ravaged by terrorism, anti-terrorism, and global warming? Check. Shadowy, sem-fascist government? Check. Soulless capitalism relentlessly shilled in ubiquitous advertising? Check. Population stripped of dignity and basic compassion? Check. There is more than one reference to the war in Iraq, which will undoubtedly date this film in just a few years.However, ""Children of Men"" manages to rise above this genre's cliches in several important ways. First, the most pressing problem is not one specifically related to the troubles of today: the world is dying because for some unknown reason, women can no longer have children. The film opens with the news that the youngest person on earth (18 years old) has died in a brawl.Second, the film is only set about twenty years into the future, so while the there have been some technical advancements, the landscape looks largely the same. It's just different enough to be disquieting. The double decker buses of London are still there. It's just that now, those buses pass billboards that read, ""Avoiding Fertility Tests is a Crime.""Most importantly, while this film does not break any ground in its genre, what it does, it does well. Other reviewers have complained that the film does not not make a tremendous amount of sense, and this is true. However, the film's main thrust is not a commentary on today's social moores. It is first and foremost a thriller, and we get just enough sense of what's going on to make us care, without getting bogged down in massive expositions on the hows and whys. We are told that the world is in a bad place, and we are drawn in with compelling cinematography, a fast-moving plot, and good acting.I also found some of the final scenes involving Kee, the pregnant woman, quite moving, even more so because the film ends on a decidedly ambivalent note. Early on in the film, the hero says that even if scientists discovered the cure for infertility, it wouldn't help: the world's already gone to pot. And in fact, the movie does not even get that far. It's about saving ONE woman who is pregnant. Whether this will save the world is an open question. The film also does a good job of fleshing Kee out as a person, with an actual personality. I originally passed on this movie because I assumed that she would be treated as a precious, but essentially non-sentient vessel that holds The Antidote to the World's Troubles. While some characters in the film do see her as such, the viewers are allowed to experience her as a unique individual.Final analysis: a very strong example of its genre. Not as imaginative as BladeRunner, not as satiric as Brazil, but 100x better than, say, Running Man.

The spectre of our current situation hangs over this film bleakly and the filmmakers clearly intend us to respond and compare this future dystopian world with the conflicts we find ourselves fighting right now.  Too few films make an effort to try to comment on big controversial issues of today on this scale, so this movie scores more points for me on that front.  Now, some people will probably see the parallelism, unsubtle as it is, as an attack on their point of view and probably resent the political subtext, but I think the movie is relatively fair in raising its issues actually and spreads its condemnation around to multiple sides, advocating for basic and relatively uncontroversial humanistic values at heart.  Leaving the specific immigration issues to the side, the childless future is pretty much a general metaphor for a world where innocence and optimism is being wiped out in favor of endless conflict and division, and who, really, could argue with that being a problem, whatever your individual take on what we need to do as a society from here.  Unfortunately, because the film moves quickly from location to location and situation to situation, many of the characters, good and bad, don't have much time to develop and remain rather thin stock figures.  The actors are generally quite good but, again, some don't have quite enough to work with to create multi-dimensional personas that might transcend their shortlived functional roles in the script. Clive Owen, who is on screen for most of the film, really does a fantastic job holding the whole thing together.But the main reason to see this is that this film contains some of the most jaw-dropping displays of camera work and staging you can find out there.  Cuaron has gone after a very realistic feel and so a number of scenes are shot with a minimum of CG and you get truly sucked into the suspense the way only reality really gets to you.  Fans of the art of the long take in cinema, you absolutely must see this movie immediately, as it has three or four truly remarkable lengthy takes which are startling in their complexity.  I had to immediately rewatch the sequence in the car twice after finishing this film, it is so astonishing and hard to fathom on first view.

Imagine the entire world knowing.Children of Men takes the audience on a wild ride with a somewhat downtrodden hero named Theo, portrayed by Clive Owen.On the run from an English government that persecutes individuals of any other nationality and an activist group that wants to claim an unborn baby as their own, Theo is thrust into a game of deceit and betrayal orchestrated by a society obsessed with a hope for new life. With the help of a handful of selfless individuals, Theo strives to save the unborn child. Through his adventure, without knowing it, he begins to revive something inside himself that has been dormant since the death of his own son.Steadicam shots and hand held camera movement bestow a documentary style on this film, which is set 20 years in the future. In some scenes the audio track becomes a character of its own, guiding the audience through long shots absent of dialogue. Dark, dirty scenes create a feeling of despair that is mirrored in the characters on screen. Still the actions of those characters, allow the audience to see current ideologies in the not so distant future, which brings to light many of our selfish ideas.As the sounds of the playground faded, the despair set it,"" a nurse accompanying our hero on his mission says as the two wander the deserted classrooms of an dilapidating elementary school.Beautiful long camera shots pull the audience into the world through Theo's eyes as he tries to understand why he is adamant about involving himself in something that will most likely end with his own death. Raw shots, a constantly moving camera and point of view angles maintain a look and feel that at times seem almost entirely too real.At the emotional conclusion, the movie leaves the audience with a sense of hope when, if only for a moment, the sound of a baby crying changes the behavior of not only a handful of people, but multitudes.Overall, Children of Men is a fast paced story told by an innovative director (Alfonso Cuaron) that leaves the viewer wondering about the path of humanity and acknowledging the good and bad we are all capable of.",4,A Movie Made for Blu-Ray,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,2219,"['Imagine', 'being', 'famous', 'nothing', 'more', 'age', 'Do', 'parents', 'even', 'know', 'how', 'old', 'are', 'down', 'minute', 'Imagine', 'entire', 'world', 'knowing.Children', 'Men', 'audience', 'wild', 'ride', 'somewhat', 'downtrodden', 'hero', 'named', 'Theo', 'portrayed', 'Clive', 'Owen.On', 'run', 'English', 'government', 'individuals', 'other', 'nationality', 'activist', 'group', 'claim', 'unborn', 'baby', 'own', 'Theo', 'thrust', 'game', 'deceit', 'betrayal', 'orchestrated', 'society', 'obsessed', 'hope', 'new', 'life', 'help', 'handful', 'selfless', 'individuals', 'Theo', 'save', 'unborn', 'child', 'adventure', 'knowing', 'revive', 'something', 'been', 'dormant', 'death', 'own', 'son.Steadicam', 'shots', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'movement', 'bestow', 'documentary', 'style', 'film', 'set', '20', 'years', 'future', 'scenes', 'audio', 'track', 'character', 'own', 'guiding', 'audience', 'long', 'shots', 'absent', 'dialogue', 'Dark', 'dirty', 'scenes', 'create', 'feeling', 'despair', 'mirrored', 'characters', 'screen', 'Still', 'actions', 'characters', 'allow', 'audience', 'see', 'current', 'ideologies', 'not', 'so', 'distant', 'future', 'light', 'many', 'selfish', 'ideas.As', 'sounds', 'playground', 'faded', 'despair', 'set', 'nurse', 'accompanying', 'hero', 'mission', 'two', 'wander', 'deserted', 'classrooms', 'dilapidating', 'elementary', 'school.Beautiful', 'long', 'camera', 'shots', 'pull', 'audience', 'world', 'Theo', 'eyes', 'understand', 'why', 'adamant', 'involving', 'something', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'end', 'own', 'death', 'Raw', 'shots', 'constantly', 'moving', 'camera', 'point', 'view', 'angles', 'maintain', 'look', 'feel', 'times', 'seem', 'almost', 'entirely', 'too', 'real.At', 'emotional', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'audience', 'sense', 'hope', 'when', 'only', 'moment', 'sound', 'baby', 'crying', 'behavior', 'not', 'only', 'handful', 'people', 'multitudes.Overall', 'Children', 'Men', 'fast', 'paced', 'story', 'told', 'innovative', 'director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'path', 'humanity', 'acknowledging', 'good', 'bad', 'are', 'capable']",N/A

This the main tag-line given to a film that endeavours and doesn't quite succeed in depicting P. D. James' interpretation of the future where Mankind is dying and facing complete extinction. This film makes the point astoundingly that the idea of it being the future, may seem far more backward then we have come to expect.What this piece does is recall the dustily depicted utopia that has become downfallen. Children Of Men takes the action movie conventions and twists them so much that its hard to recognise, it recalls the sporadic virtues of a satire, as the bemused main character Theo (Clive Owen) begins his adventure, conflicting and smashing from odd encounters to the next.Amid the brilliantly executed explosions true filmmaking is exposed in one superlative tracking shot that covers a mini-siege in Bexhill.This may be the only good part of the film.Dir. Cuar&oacute;n has done something not incredible, but satisfactory. Cuar&oacute;n's film is provocative, flowing with rich ideas and invention but never too conceited to stop and crack jokes.Verdict:Amazing and visually stunning in its own satire, however, not welcoming to the stunning work of P.D James. 7.5/10.

It doesn't really care to explain why an immigrant woman is having the world's first baby in 18 years. Why 18 years? Why is this movie so anti anti-immigration? Why in the world would Britain force its immigrants out when the human population is dwindling? The film never cares to explain. By midway of the film, I really didn't care about this film.The only saving grace of this film is its brilliant continuous action sequences. They were shot beautifully and the filmmakers certainly put an enormous amount of effort into them.

Whether a flying car or talking ape ruins credibility, there is always something unbelievable distracting the viewer.  In this film, however, there is enough familiarity with the picture of impending apocalypse - regardless of scientific likelihood - that it feels possible.The year is a believable 2027 (thanks to the subtle cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki), an expanded neon world in shambles, governments have collapsed, armed insurrection threatens anarchy.  As a result of harsh immigration policies, Britain serves as the desired destination...if one can get past the immigration camps (read: concentration camps), swarms of menacing guards with machine guns and dogs, and vicious bands of outsiders who have formed ad hoc societies to survive.  A credible global political climate exists where fringe groups war with an apathetic, if not conspiratorial government.  Making matters worse is the death of ""baby Diego,"" humankind's youngest living person, which has shocked seemingly everyone except former activist Theo (Clive Owen).  Every bit the flawed hero, Theo apathetically drones through his alcohol and cigarette filled day of avoiding emotions.  Birth is now seemingly impossible - none for over 18 years - extinction is imminent.  Hope is lost.  Not until Theo is reunited with his ex-wife Julian (Juliane Moore), an underground militia leader whose organization is protecting Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey), the first pregnant woman in eighteen years, does he embrace the reluctant role of protecting humanity's last hope, thereby finding a purpose and possible salvation.Like McCarthy's ""The Road,"" the power in the despair is the possibility.  In fact, this could very well be the precursor to McCarthy's vision; it's a world with a glimmer of hope, a dash of humanity, and a step removed from the complete chaos of a world with nearly feral humans.  While there is a definite gut punch in Children of Men, and similar themes of humanity's demise persist (e.g. famine, disease), it's not quite as hopeless as the starving, exhausting cross-country march in The Road for a single reason: birth causes hope to spring eternal.  True credit goes to Alfonso Cuaron for creating a world in which giving up may be the best answer, but holding onto hope is the likeliest choice.Acting-wise, Clive Owens truly comes into his own as a hero.  I've never quite felt the same way about a character he has portrayed, but the vulnerability of Theo made him appealing...especially when he went the second half of the movie in flip flops (don't ask).  The rest of the cast fills in their required gaps, with Pam Ferris acting like a renegade wet-nurse who remembers birthing before the baby drought, Chiwetel Ejiofor balances good and evil while desperately trying to fill the shoes being worn by Clive Owens, and Michael Caine gives the viewer a peek inside the chemically enhanced mind of an eternal optimist.By the time the second act breaks, this is a full-fledged, war-torn action (passable but not spectacular) movie and all that's left is watching to see if Theo will deliver Kee and her baby to safety.

Extremely provocative, this film made me realize how important children are to our future.  Without them, the world becomes psychologically insane before dying a physical death.Mother Nature has imposed her own form of birth control on mankind.  At first, a few women began miscarrying, then hundreds more until it became a world-wide epidemic.  It is now the year 2027 and a child has not been born in eighteen years; despair and grief has led the world to the brink of total destruction.  Every country, except Britain, seems to have collapsed.  The British government has launched a campaign to rid the country of all illegal immigrants known as Fugees.  One of these Fugees is a pregnant girl, Joy.  Theo Faron (Clive Owen of ""Derailed"") struggles to help her get safely to a boat owned by Operation Humanity.  Unfortunately, a terrorist group, the Fishes, wants to use Joy's baby as a pawn for its diabolical plans against the British government.""Children of Men"" is highly recommended for fans of apocalyptic, end-of-the-world horror.  Extremely tense and war-like in its graphic depiction of street violence, this film is highly emotional.  Not easily forgotten, it will leave you asking, ""Could this really happen?""  One touching scene that made me cry was when Joy's baby was being carried out of a destroyed building.  The tenants stood spellbound, gaping and murmuring, ""A baby.  A baby,"" as they remembered a world that was long gone.

No child has been born in the past 18 years and the youngest person on the planet has just died at age 18.  This provocative film by director Alfonso Cuaron is science fiction action thriller that in many ways mirrors our world and the direct we might be headed.  There are many under lying theme in this film, global warming, medicated society overly processed foods, mass sickness, our dependency of science and our growing distaste for organized religion terrorism and fanaticism as well as illegal immigration and what it does to and for society.With all those plot points floating just under the surface it's hard to have a social commentary about these subjects without getting smacked in the face with it, but somehow this director pulls it off.  These themes are not preached to us in the film, we see them quite sparcely and the effects of them are briefly touched on, but little dialog or character diatribes are given.  It shows us the world and why and lets the audience fill in the gaps.  It's a gritty, dirty film with realistic violence that seems like you could be watching the news as much a movie.Many people debate the problems that this film focuses on and many more people like to point to a film like this as ""left wing propaganda"".  I really don't see it in this film... but then again I'm not looking for it.  I guess if you wanna look for a left wing slant in a political driven movie your likely to find it but this movie leave much commentary to be said.The director does a wonderful job pacing the movie with long takes and limited cuts, many action scenes go on for many minutes never cutting.  You really get immersed in the world that might be set in the future but feels very real. The style really makes you feel uneasy and anxious for the characters and the situation.  Lots of action without feeling like an action movie, never glorifying the violence with amazing action scenes or face paces cuts.  It's dusty, dirty and uncomfortably plausible view of man on man violence.  I really liked the set designs and the elements of technology that, like humans, seem to have stop evolving and all look out of date without being retro or archaic. Clive Owen carries the movie and really shows some range with the depth of his character who is a hero, even if he's a slightly inept and unwilling one.There are many things about this movie that make you wonder about the other aspects of human life if you knew there was no future for the human race it's self.  What would it be like to live in a world with no children when everything in the year 2007 revolves around them and is marketed with the family in mind?  No children playing no laughter, nothing to remind you of the innocence of a child.  What horrors we adults would bestow on one another without having to worry about influencing or raising a child.  Would morality and standard you set for your own existence go out the door?  This is one of many questions presented in this movie.A very unique take on an apocalyptic sci fi movie, where we don't meet our end by a war, meteor, nukes or another large catastrophe.  In this one the human race just kind of flickers and dribbles to its demise.

Perhaps as nobody was born and the work force retired there was nobody left to take their place.

Blade runner comes to mind, as you've maybe come across a few reviews with it. I feel it bare's strong resemblance to the sleeper hit 12 monkeys, staring Bruce Willis as a confused convict with a gaping hole in his memory, which slowly rejuvenates through the coarse of the movie towards the climax, in which he discovers his own beginning. A sort of Time vortex for you science minded ones. The comparison comes from the anxiety ridden truth that there seems to be this world, which is perfectly sensible to the characters within, but to the viewers, is crypted and otherworldly. Though, both, lead you to believe there is a final answer, just in that mysterious, ambiguous, unsaid way. For Children of men it is hope, not the avoidably gargoned definitions that lie in the answers of a not-to-distant-future's civilization. For 12 monkeys it was the terrible agony of fatalism. But it seemed trapped within that boys eyes, eyeing his adult self, that there was the hope that perhaps one lifeline will produce the cure for a diseased and hopeless world. The same hope, resounds at the end with the idea of the human project.Children of Men is outstandingly ambiguous in nearly all departments. It thrusts you into a mans life, whose past seems to slowly catch up with him. You are led to trust this man, as will the fertile carrier, whose harsh, direct way of communicating somehow becomes servile to. (Fatalistic?) It seemed almost out of character for her, after fumigating her disfavor for the man almost incessantly from her sudden arrival. She uncovers her meanness by unbosoming her 'boys' name, whom he disregards as a clownish attempt at a most serious matter, and to take a step back in the timeline of the movie to a further degree as she freely, and carelessly, 'unbosom's' herself again to show in true form the nature of their journey, her round, and very pregnant belly. (in fact nearly bursting as you will soon find out) The film is a respectable combination of artistic camera work, and twisting, gyrating tension in what feels like a short story of sorts. It is without expanations, but fullfilling in that way that pocket, novellas provide for subway riders, or those with ample and numerous moments alone. It's climax is gratuitously wartorn, and its escapism edges you to the borders of your seat, panting and sweating in the dark, mesmerized by the shockingly, numbingly good sequences until the poetic end. Filled with applaudable actors giving respectable due to a most determined director. I couldn't help but stand and feel a jerking strain at seeing the blank screen and trademark like post-title.",4,Science fiction hits us in 2007!

The enthusiasm of many of the reviews of this picture is entirely justified. Though it is unlikely to make anyone feel 'good', it will offer a thought provoking and chillingly plausible vision of a world sliding into despair. The pseudo-documentary camera work is slightly jarring at times, but lends further weight to the film's sense of being grounded in a realist tradition.The most outstanding thing in this film is the utter realism it achieves through extended shots that seem to run forever, but never lose excitement. I don't have to tell anyone the two most amazing shots in the film that use this. If you've seen it, you know. If you haven't, you will. The tale of post-apocalyptic London and the dismal future of the world is nothing new. But the depiction of the ""near-future"" in ""Children of Men"" is so subtle and organic; it comes across surrealistically.... real. It allows the viewer to look past the time and focus on the story. (We've all seen enough films that show us the bright and shiny, flashy as Epcot Center, future) It's nice to see this done so well while still being interesting and unsullied. Another thing I loved about this film was that it didn't try to explain what happened like often happens in sci-fi movies, this is very plot driven, they just show you the landscape and tell you the situation and move on. I also liked that on the extremes of either side of the political landscape in this movie they where more or less the same, just on side had power and the other none. I thought that was very true about most of life, with the people in the middle just kind of caught up in it all.As for the performances, I thought Michael Caine shines as the eccentric hippie who lovingly attends to his disabled wife and Clive Owen extends himself as the chain smoking hero who doesn't need a cache of firearms to justify this mantle. Julianne Moore is typically excellent as the leader of the terrorist group and there are a few cameos such as Peter Mullan as the gruff and pragmatic soldier Syd. ""Children of Men"" definitely has heart. In a gritty war-torn scene of violence, to see the hearts of men and women so touched by the sight of a child made me slightly tear up. I am filled with admiration for Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n - he is truly a visionary and while I don't particularly like what he shows us here, he expresses it with intense artistry.  In the end, for all its action and excitement, this film is about the heart of humanity, If not the survival of it.",4,"Life is disposable, but the potential for life is revered.",1177977600,"05 1, 2007",2007,2565,"['would', ""n't"", 'say', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'close', 'enthusiasm', 'many', 'reviews', 'picture', 'entirely', 'justified', 'unlikely', 'make', 'anyone', 'feel', ""'good"", 'will', 'offer', 'thought', 'provoking', 'chillingly', 'plausible', 'vision', 'world', 'sliding', 'despair', 'pseudo-documentary', 'camera', 'work', 'slightly', 'jarring', 'times', 'further', 'weight', 'film', 'sense', 'being', 'grounded', 'realist', 'tradition.The', 'most', 'outstanding', 'thing', 'film', 'utter', 'realism', 'extended', 'shots', 'seem', 'run', 'forever', 'never', 'lose', 'excitement', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'tell', 'anyone', 'two', 'most', 'amazing', 'shots', 'film', 'use', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'know', 'have', ""n't"", 'will', 'tale', 'post-apocalyptic', 'London', 'dismal', 'future', 'world', 'nothing', 'new', 'depiction', 'near-future', 'Children', 'Men', 'so', 'subtle', 'organic', 'surrealistically', 'real', 'viewer', 'look', 'time', 'focus', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'films', 'show', 'bright', 'shiny', 'flashy', 'Epcot', 'Center', 'future', 'nice', 'see', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'still', 'being', 'interesting', 'unsullied', 'thing', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'like', 'often', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'very', 'plot', 'driven', 'just', 'show', 'landscape', 'tell', 'situation', 'move', 'also', 'liked', 'extremes', 'side', 'political', 'landscape', 'movie', 'where', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'just', 'side', 'had', 'power', 'other', 'none', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'true', 'most', 'life', 'people', 'middle', 'just', 'kind', 'caught', 'up', 'performances', 'thought', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'shines', 'eccentric', 'hippie', 'who', 'lovingly', 'disabled', 'wife', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'chain', 'smoking', 'hero', 'who', ""n't"", 'need', 'cache', 'firearms', 'justify', 'mantle', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'typically', 'excellent', 'leader', 'terrorist', 'group', 'are', 'few', 'cameos', 'such', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'gruff', 'pragmatic', 'soldier', 'Syd', 'Children', 'Men', 'definitely', 'heart', 'gritty', 'war-torn', 'scene', 'violence', 'see', 'hearts', 'men', 'women', 'so', 'touched', 'sight', 'child', 'made', 'slightly', 'tear', 'up', 'am', 'filled', 'admiration', 'Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'truly', 'visionary', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'like', 'what', 'here', 'intense', 'artistry', 'end', 'action', 'excitement', 'film', 'heart', 'humanity', 'not', 'survival']",N/A

All the ecstatic positive reviews lured me to the theater for Children of Men. Sci-Fi is likely my favorite genre and the rare sci-fi movie is always appreciated.But, Children of Men is NOT sci-fi. Just because it's set in England circa 2027 (LOL; indistinguishable from present day London except for a bunch of rickshaws) does not make it science fiction.There is only 1 idea in the entire movie; humans are infertile. This is not explained or elaborated upon at all, and ceases being interesting about 10 minutes into the film.The most reoccurring theme in the entire movie is that the government is rounding up and deporting all immigrants.  Hm...  So imagine population pressure ceases to exist across the globe; what would England do?  It's so obvious!  Concentrate all your resources on rounding up and deporting your youngest citizens.  Makes sense to me.  This is some kind of preachy, reverse xenophobia; every bit as illogical and stupid as xenophobia.  This is the worst kind of sci-fi, that which is totally implausible.The only concepts which could have made this movie interesting aren't explored in the slightest.  For example, the cause of, and attempted solutions to the infertility are never discussed, the ""Human Project"" isn't elaborated on at all.  I guess these are less important than weed jokes and Beetles references, which are copious...All the acting not provided by Owen and Caine is abysmal.  Seriously, the acting [and dialogue] was like nails on a chalkboard, some of the worst in recent memory (think Matrix 3).  Add that to the trite and predictable situations [poorly] acted out by disinteresting and annoying characters.  PLOT: meet a contact -> hide out -> chase -> contact -> hide out -> chase...Children of Men ends with a pathetic and predictable surge of over the top, Private Ryan style war violence.  This incoherent addition is insulting for a variety of reasons.  Most obviously because it is completely unrealistic; no semblance of military practice or strategy at all, except for loud noises and explosions.  And most importantly because the creators seemed to think this violence would placate and please those of us watching it.Children of Men is an insult to sci-fi, the source material and anyone who has the displeasure of viewing it.",1,"Moronic, incoherent... just plain terrible",1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,2382,"[""n't"", 'Sci-Fi', 'garbage', 'Do', 'not', 'see', 'Blade', 'Runner', '21st', 'century', 'Right', 'ecstatic', 'positive', 'reviews', 'lured', 'theater', 'Children', 'Men', 'Sci-Fi', 'likely', 'favorite', 'genre', 'rare', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'always', 'appreciated.But', 'Children', 'Men', 'NOT', 'sci-fi', 'Just', 'set', 'England', 'circa', '2027', 'LOL', 'indistinguishable', 'present', 'day', 'London', 'bunch', 'rickshaws', 'not', 'make', 'science', 'only', '1', 'idea', 'entire', 'movie', 'humans', 'are', 'infertile', 'not', 'explained', 'elaborated', 'ceases', 'being', 'interesting', '10', 'minutes', 'film.The', 'most', 'reoccurring', 'theme', 'entire', 'movie', 'government', 'rounding', 'up', 'deporting', 'immigrants', 'Hm', 'So', 'imagine', 'population', 'pressure', 'exist', 'globe', 'what', 'would', 'England', 'do', 'so', 'obvious', 'Concentrate', 'resources', 'rounding', 'up', 'deporting', 'youngest', 'citizens', 'Makes', 'sense', 'kind', 'preachy', 'reverse', 'xenophobia', 'bit', 'illogical', 'stupid', 'xenophobia', 'worst', 'kind', 'sci-fi', 'totally', 'implausible.The', 'only', 'concepts', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'interesting', 'are', ""n't"", 'explored', 'slightest', 'example', 'cause', 'attempted', 'solutions', 'infertility', 'are', 'never', 'discussed', 'Human', 'Project', ""n't"", 'elaborated', 'guess', 'are', 'less', 'important', 'weed', 'jokes', 'Beetles', 'references', 'are', 'copious', 'acting', 'not', 'provided', 'Owen', 'Caine', 'abysmal', 'Seriously', 'acting', '[', 'dialogue', ']', 'was', 'nails', 'chalkboard', 'worst', 'recent', 'memory', 'think', 'Matrix', '3', 'trite', 'predictable', 'situations', '[', 'poorly', ']', 'acted', 'out', 'disinteresting', 'annoying', 'characters', 'PLOT', 'meet', 'contact', '>', 'hide', '>', 'chase', '>', 'contact', '>', 'hide', '>', 'chase', 'Children', 'Men', 'pathetic', 'predictable', 'surge', 'top', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'style', 'war', 'violence', 'incoherent', 'addition', 'insulting', 'variety', 'reasons', 'Most', 'obviously', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'semblance', 'military', 'practice', 'strategy', 'loud', 'noises', 'explosions', 'most', 'importantly', 'creators', 'seemed', 'think', 'violence', 'would', 'placate', 'please', 'watching', 'it.Children', 'Men', 'insult', 'sci-fi', 'source', 'material', 'anyone', 'who', 'displeasure', 'viewing']",N/A

human beings lose the ability of fertility and one black young woman got pregnant and it's a miracle and the only hope of human beings and civilization? why england and all the other countries fall into chaos, why? just because nobody can have kids anymore? what a ridiculous scenario is this? why almost all the futuristic movies only painted the future so hopeless and so dark? the guy's ex-wife is an activist, a rebel, but for what? against what? how the h..l that black woman got pregnant? why a group of the rebels at first want to save her and later want to kill her? what is the purpose of michael cain's hippy role? owen escorts the pregnant woman running away from....?then hit by a bullet in the last escape scene, dies in the small boat, then a ship named 'tomorrow' appears in the fog...well, symbolize the human civilization still has hope, just by one kid? does it mean only this black young woman could conceive and she would produce more babies? why 99.9999999...% women lost the ability of pregnancy? does it mean that all the men cannot produce sperms anymore? or all the women cannot produce eggs anymore, they lose the periods, the menstrocycle pregnancy would totally lose around 2037? what caused it? or is it possible that only all the women except one have lost their fertilities but all the men still got their sperms produced normally? or all the men and women have both lost their abilities to produce their next generations? if just one woman and a man could bear child, where's that man? because without that man, that woman could only have one child, either male or female, she or he still cannot produce off-springs. but if that man could be found and could keep that woman pregnant many times, their children then had to commit incest to produce the next generation. if all the other women lost their pregnancy ability and only that woman still has the fertility ability, and all the men still have the ability to produce sperms, they could make and keep this woman continue to pregnant, there still got the incest problem ahead in the future. but if you believe we were all came from adam and eve, then we have to accept the fact that we are all the product of a long history of incest. can you accept such fact?the other logic question i'd like to ask the screenwriters and the director is this: if all the men and women lost their abilities to have kids, they definitely would have lost their hope and would have definitely lost the urge to fight, because why people fight? why people become so selfish and so greedy? because they would like to and have to accumulate more money, more belongings for their next generation, the more, the better. if without children, without their offsprings, what's the purpose of doing anything? becasue their lives would be the last existences on earth, there would be no sense of trying to do anything anymore albeit fighting against each other or one another, it would be totally senseless and meaningless.this is such a stupid movie based on an absolutely illogic premise and scenario. to think how great, how meaningful this movie is would just prove that the way of your think is illogic and senseless.as to this movie itself, you better think about it again, there's nothing new but cliched scene after scene, chasing, fighting, escaping, riot, bombing, bloody gory...so just tell me what else is new?

There are differences between the two and, of course, verbal descriptions of characters' thoughts are often hard to reproduce on screen. Almost always, sacrifices must be made in the script - and this film is no exception. However, I DO feel the movie stays true to the INTENT and MESSAGE of the book and it is quite a wonderful film.It is futuristic and if you know anything about the author of the book on which this film is based (P.D. James) you'll know this isn't her usual mystery story. But it is one of my favorite works that she has written, telling of a time when people are infertile and of the hope that resides when there is a chance that someone can produce children again.The government gets involved and there are political messages and subplots, all set against a certain, dark atmosphere. This film will make you think and I actually find the possibility of a future where infertility is almost the norm not outside the realm of possibility. Even if you don't, the ""What ifs?"" will keep you interested in this masterful film and Clive Owen proves that he is  becoming more interesting an actor as time goes on.",5,A bold departure for P.D.

646795,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00005JP9X,K. Driscoll,"[14, 19]","Children of Men gives us yet another brilliant cinematic dystopian experience in the tradition of great films like A Clockwork Orange, Logan's Run, The Terminator, 1984 and Bladerunner.  It makes a web of appropriate, contemporary and significant social insights, while at the same time it gives us hopeful storytelling about the fall and possible triumph of humankind.The story is set in the year 2027, which is closer than one may think and seems to follow a time period of immense global change.  Make no mistake about it, in order for things to end up the way they do in the year 2027 here in Children of Men, we will have to endure some really horrendous ordeals in pretty much the next two or three years.  This includes a flu pandemic, some kind of nuclear conflict, large scale societal and cultural breakdown, terrorism, the collapse of all governments outside of England and of course, the most significant feature, the complete infertility of all female humans on Earth since the year 2009.  Despair is all that exists in this world but despair is not what this story is about.  Children of Men is a story about hope.Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n directs; one of my personal favorite filmmakers for Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n.  The story is inspired by P.D. James' novel of the same name.  Cuar&oacute;n's take is actually quite consistent with Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n in that it is a road movie about the primary character's self-discovery and makes some really insightful social commentary.  The movie opens by informing us of the unexpected death of ""baby Diego"", the youngest human being on Earth.  We then follow Theo Faron (Clive Owen) who is an unlikely hero in complete despair.  He is a flawed drunk who smokes and when asked about his smoking he replies ""it's not working"", implying that he just doesn't care to live.  Then again, in this setting, who really does?  The human race will be extinct in less than 100 years.  Children of Men could've benefited from less detailed advertising as I almost wished I didn't know that Theo's transformation from despair to hope would be because of an African refugee Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), who is the first pregnant woman on Earth in 18 years.  That isn't to say the film did not surprise me time and time again.  It certainly did.  I didn't know much about Children of Men going into it and I think knowing less is better for the audience here more so than many films, so I will spoil no more than I have already.There are two things that make this movie amazing, beyond the fundamental strengths of it's story and overall direction.  The first point I'd like to mention is with regards to the performances.  Each actor melts into their roles brilliantly.  Obviously we expect this from Julianne Moore and Michael Caine but we get some great performances from the newcomers as well.  Even the small supporting roles are great.  But most of all, Clive Owen has truly arrived here.  He actually helped write for his own character and his passion for the role really shows.  I'm actually surprised he wasn't considered for an Oscar.  It's often easy to say that the character's writing itself is what pulls forth a great performance from the actor, but the fact that Clive assisted in writing the character into the screenplay, and then blew me away with his performance is remarkable to say the least.  The other big strength for me is the modern political flavor.  The film functions as a loose deliberation of sorts on our current global political climate, and it offers us some potentially dire consequences.  It's elaborate to decipher where Cuar&oacute;n's convictions lie, but it's certainly worth joining in on his insights regardless of where you, the viewer, stand.Keep in mind, Cuar&oacute;n does not care to offer us a back story like most movies do and the casual viewer may be frustrated with some key questions.  It's not a typical action film narrative and the audience is expected to draw some of their own conclusions or even accept that we just don't have the answers at all.  Of course that mirrors real life and for me it's challenging questions that make a movie great.",5,The Best Film of 2006,1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,4160,"['Children', 'Men', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'dystopian', 'experience', 'tradition', 'great', 'films', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Logan', 'Run', 'Terminator', '1984', 'Bladerunner', 'web', 'appropriate', 'contemporary', 'significant', 'social', 'insights', 'same', 'time', 'hopeful', 'storytelling', 'fall', 'possible', 'triumph', 'humankind.The', 'story', 'set', 'year', '2027', 'closer', 'one', 'may', 'think', 'follow', 'time', 'period', 'immense', 'global', 'change', 'Make', 'mistake', 'order', 'things', 'end', 'up', 'way', 'do', 'year', '2027', 'here', 'Children', 'Men', 'will', 'have', 'endure', 'really', 'horrendous', 'ordeals', 'pretty', 'much', 'next', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'flu', 'pandemic', 'kind', 'nuclear', 'conflict', 'large', 'scale', 'societal', 'cultural', 'breakdown', 'terrorism', 'collapse', 'governments', 'England', 'course', 'most', 'significant', 'feature', 'complete', 'infertility', 'female', 'humans', 'Earth', 'year', '2009', 'Despair', 'world', 'despair', 'not', 'what', 'story', 'Children', 'Men', 'story', 'hope.Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'directs', 'one', 'personal', 'favorite', 'filmmakers', 'Y', 'tu', 'mam', 'aacute', 'eacute', 'story', 'inspired', 'P.D', 'James', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'take', 'actually', 'quite', 'consistent', 'Y', 'tu', 'mam', 'aacute', 'eacute', 'road', 'movie', 'primary', 'character', 'self-discovery', 'really', 'insightful', 'social', 'commentary', 'movie', 'informing', 'unexpected', 'death', 'baby', 'Diego', 'youngest', 'human', 'being', 'Earth', 'then', 'follow', 'Theo', 'Faron', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'complete', 'despair', 'flawed', 'drunk', 'who', 'when', 'asked', 'smoking', 'not', 'working', 'implying', 'just', ""n't"", 'care', 'live', 'Then', 'again', 'setting', 'who', 'really', 'human', 'race', 'will', 'be', 'extinct', 'less', '100', 'years', 'Children', 'Men', 'could', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'less', 'detailed', 'advertising', 'almost', 'wished', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Theo', 'transformation', 'despair', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'African', 'refugee', 'Kee', 'Claire-Hope', 'Ashitey', 'who', 'first', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'Earth', '18', 'years', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'surprise', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'certainly', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Children', 'Men', 'going', 'think', 'knowing', 'less', 'better', 'audience', 'here', 'more', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'will', 'spoil', 'more', 'have', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'make', 'movie', 'amazing', 'fundamental', 'strengths', 'story', 'overall', 'direction', 'first', 'point', ""'d"", 'like', 'mention', 'regards', 'performances', 'actor', 'melts', 'roles', 'brilliantly', 'Obviously', 'expect', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'get', 'great', 'performances', 'newcomers', 'as', 'well', 'Even', 'small', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'great', 'most', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'truly', 'arrived', 'here', 'actually', 'helped', 'write', 'own', 'character', 'passion', 'role', 'really', ""'m"", 'actually', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'considered', 'Oscar', 'often', 'easy', 'say', 'character', 'writing', 'what', 'forth', 'great', 'performance', 'actor', 'fact', 'Clive', 'assisted', 'writing', 'character', 'screenplay', 'then', 'blew', 'away', 'performance', 'remarkable', 'say', 'least', 'other', 'big', 'strength', 'modern', 'political', 'flavor', 'film', 'functions', 'loose', 'deliberation', 'sorts', 'current', 'global', 'political', 'climate', 'potentially', 'dire', 'consequences', 'elaborate', 'decipher', 'where', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'convictions', 'lie', 'certainly', 'worth', 'joining', 'insights', 'regardless', 'where', 'viewer', 'stand.Keep', 'mind', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'not', 'care', 'offer', 'back', 'story', 'most', 'movies', 'do', 'casual', 'viewer', 'may', 'be', 'frustrated', 'key', 'questions', 'not', 'typical', 'action', 'film', 'narrative', 'audience', 'expected', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'even', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'answers', 'course', 'mirrors', 'real', 'life', 'challenging', 'questions', 'make', 'movie', 'great']",N/A

646797,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00005JP9X,Kevin Killian,"[2, 2]","After the triumphs of Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN and his two excellent movies for children, I guess I had high hopes for Cuaron's version of CHILDREN OF MEN, and to a certain extent he overcomes the basic torpidity of its source material, PD James' futuristic 1992 novel warning of the upcoming infertility epidemic.  Cuaron plays the concomitant anti-immigrant hysteria thick and it becomes pretty much the dominant theme of the film, together with the use of torture and unjust captivity.  This leaves a few holes in the plot--or rather in the mise en scene.  In the world we see, the UK has embarked on a ""Britain for Britons"" political campaign in which people from every other country in the world are systematically denigrated in order to better capture and eliminate them.  In such a world, would ""Baby Diego"" become a natural hero--an Argentine?  Wouldn't the media focus be on the youngest-born British baby?  And yet we find out that Baby Diego is revered in England same as Princess Diana, people bringing flowers and spreading them out at Hyde Park like they did for Diana, choking up at his baby pictures as they did for Harry and Wills.  Somewhere there's a disconnect, although Cuaron's restless, inventive cinematographer rarely lets his camera rest long enough for us to ponder such subtleties--yet I think they manage to stick in one's subsconscious, burrs under the saddle, that somehow interfere with our reception of the film's many strong points.And those include . . . Cuaron's fluid direction, so that in the middle of epic battle scenes his camera will flutter and follow the progress of a single piece of cloth torn from a dead man's shirt across the dirty Bexhill Camp brickyard, or the scene, which could have been so groan worthy, where Michael Caine explains to Kee and Miriam what happened between Clive Owen and Julianne Moore years ago (the entire exposition), while Owen listens in, his face a rugged mirror for his pain and his unwilling rise to activism.  For in some ways it's a terribly written scene, saved by some great staging and acting, in other ways, we feel like we're watching cinema being invented all over again.  I wish Pauline Kael were alive to describe the exhilaration of watching, not a film about Abu Ghraib, but a film that dares invoke the spectacle of Abu Ghraib directly while ""pretending"" to be about how wonderful children are and how the sight of a human baby can reduce hardened battle veterans to genuflecting and making the sign of the cross.The boat thing, the baby thing, the rays of ""hope"" that punctuate the second half of the movie don't ring true, they aren't earned in the same way as the totalizing action of anti-immigration forces in the first half.

646799,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JP9X,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","""Children of Men,"" by Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron, was one of the more unusual success stories of 2006. While not a blockbuster, by any standards, this unconventional film was all but abandoned by a studio that didn't know how to market it. Positioned for release during prime Oscar season, this is not a film that was backed as a potential nominee. However, as almost universal critical acceptance came rolling in--a smaller, but loyal, fan base discovered and embraced this movie. ""Children of Men"" ended up, therefore, with much acclaim and admiration, decent box office, a more widespread distribution, and 3 Academy Award nominations (Screenplay, Editing, and Cinematography).In an interesting twist on the apocalypse drama genre, ""Children of Men"" presents a world that is coming to an end with a whimper as opposed to a bang. For there is no cataclysmic explosion forcing humanity to confront it's own mortality. No, in this case, people have simply lost the ability to reproduce--and the youngest person alive is now approaching adulthood. Of course, over the ensuing years (the film is set in 2027) of this ongoing tragedy, there has been an expected societal breakdown. Now, the streets of London are ravaged by terrorism and extremist groups are battling to overturn the complacent, and possibly complicit, government. While this may seem like a broad and epic canvas, ""Children of Men"" covers many weighty issues within the relatively straightforward story of its protagonist, Clive Owen. Owen, an ex-activist who is now somewhat disconnected, is drawn back into a world that he wants no part of. The unlikeliest and most reluctant of heroes, Owen confronts his own ideology and apathy when an extremist group introduces him to a pregnant teen. Fearing that she will be exploited, used, or otherwise politically manipulated by the warring factions--he decides to deliver her to a utopian (and perhaps mythical) society whose only interest is in saving humanity. Getting her free from the controlling clutches that bind her and crossing a country plagued by insurrection, ""Children of Men"" becomes a harrowing and brutal action picture with violence that resembles much of what we see on TV news today.Owen has long been a favorite of mine. Having taken notice of him in ""Croupier"" (and if you haven't caught this great noir piece, please do), I have been quite impressed by his rise in mainstream films. He was so electrifying in ""Closer"" that I even forgave him for ""Derailed."" Here, he is the perfect antihero--and his evolution from a disinterested party to a rogue patriot is an indelible portrait of a man rediscovering a purpose and meaning in life. Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, and Clare-Hope Ashitey (as the pregnant team) lead an able supporting cast. The documentary feel of the film's action pieces suit the material well, and the conflicts are well staged and all too believable.Now, there are many political debates to be started from ""Children of Men"" (none of which will I engage in here), but what I admired about the film's screenplay is how focused it is. Without being preachy or engaging in unnecessary ""speechifying,"" this film plays as straight action. And while there is a ""revelatory"" moment near the end that almost goes too far (but is understandable within the context of the film), ""Children of Men"" allows you to draw your own conclusions. It just presents the story and leaves much of its interpretation up to the viewer. That, to me, is always a satisfying choice. Whether you view this film as action, sci-fi, political allegory, or a combination of all three--it's a worthwhile and entertaining film.

646800,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B00005JP9X,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[5, 7]","Children of Men takes place in Britain in the year 2027. The film begins with the death of the world's youngest person, Baby Diego. The world mourns his death in a manner usually reserved for larger than life figures like Mother Theresa and Princess Diana. Women weep in the streets and people stand transfixed by the television watching the report of his death. Baby Diego was 18 years old.In this version of the future, women are infertile and there hasn't been a human birth in nearly 20 years. Clive Owen plays Theo, a Brit who is just living day to day, but who has become lost in a world thrown into turmoil by its impending doom. Fertility tests are mandatory in this future, the world is at war, and Britain is the only place that seems to have some hold on civilization. Accordingly, people flock to get there, but the borders are strictly patrolled and refugees are locked in cages and displayed for all to see.Julianne Moore plays Julian, the leader of a ""terrorist"" organization called Fish, whose goal is to allow a home for every refugee who seeks asylum in Britain. She is also Theo's ex-wife. She comes to him after years of separation to ask him to help transport the first pregnant woman in nearly 20 years. It his her hope that the birth of this child might stop the turmoil and strife engulfing the country and possibly bring the world back from the brink of chaos.Children of Men paints a rather bleak picture of the future and, in this respect, was at times hard to watch. The world is torn apart by its impending doom and people have nothing left to live for.  This unborn child could give hope to the many who have lost it, but there are others who would use it for their own ends. This film was gripping, engaging, and moving despite the fact that it's also depressing, violent, and difficult to watch. The lack of a future has thrown the world into utter chaos with people being killed in the streets, the government dropping bombs at random, and anarchists fighting to put the world back in order. The fate of the future rests in the hands of someone who isn't even born yet, and that's something that's hard to perceive.  Still, I think Children of Men is definitely worth watching and it definitely starts the 2007 film season with a bang.",4,"""I can't remember when I last had hope, and I can't remember when anyone else did either""",1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,2268,"['Children', 'Men', 'place', 'Britain', 'year', '2027', 'film', 'death', 'world', 'youngest', 'person', 'Baby', 'Diego', 'world', 'death', 'manner', 'usually', 'reserved', 'larger', 'life', 'figures', 'Mother', 'Theresa', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'Women', 'weep', 'streets', 'people', 'stand', 'transfixed', 'television', 'watching', 'report', 'death', 'Baby', 'Diego', 'was', '18', 'years', 'old.In', 'version', 'future', 'women', 'are', 'infertile', ""n't"", 'been', 'human', 'birth', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Theo', 'Brit', 'who', 'just', 'living', 'day', 'day', 'who', 'become', 'lost', 'world', 'thrown', 'turmoil', 'impending', 'doom', 'Fertility', 'tests', 'are', 'mandatory', 'future', 'world', 'war', 'Britain', 'only', 'place', 'have', 'hold', 'civilization', 'Accordingly', 'people', 'flock', 'get', 'there', 'borders', 'are', 'strictly', 'patrolled', 'refugees', 'are', 'locked', 'cages', 'displayed', 'see.Julianne', 'Moore', 'plays', 'Julian', 'leader', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'called', 'Fish', 'goal', 'allow', 'home', 'refugee', 'who', 'asylum', 'Britain', 'also', 'Theo', 'ex-wife', 'years', 'separation', 'ask', 'help', 'transport', 'first', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'hope', 'birth', 'child', 'might', 'stop', 'turmoil', 'strife', 'engulfing', 'country', 'possibly', 'bring', 'world', 'back', 'brink', 'chaos.Children', 'Men', 'rather', 'bleak', 'picture', 'future', 'respect', 'was', 'times', 'hard', 'watch', 'world', 'torn', 'apart', 'impending', 'doom', 'people', 'have', 'nothing', 'left', 'live', 'unborn', 'child', 'could', 'give', 'hope', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'are', 'others', 'who', 'would', 'use', 'own', 'ends', 'film', 'was', 'gripping', 'engaging', 'moving', 'fact', 'also', 'depressing', 'violent', 'difficult', 'watch', 'lack', 'future', 'thrown', 'world', 'utter', 'chaos', 'people', 'being', 'killed', 'streets', 'government', 'dropping', 'bombs', 'random', 'fighting', 'put', 'world', 'back', 'order', 'fate', 'future', 'hands', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'born', 'yet', 'something', 'hard', 'perceive', 'Still', 'think', 'Children', 'Men', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'definitely', '2007', 'film', 'season', 'bang']",N/A
646801,ATBADDXLX27EW,B00005JP9X,kidnugget,"[7, 9]","This film is a technical marvel.  I don't mean technical as in ""George Lucas technical"" where there's a big green screen and lots of FX.  I mean the cinematography, the mathematics of the shots, all of it is quite brilliant.  The director has made a minimal amount of cuts in this film, and the result is long, realistic shots, intricately choreographed and rehearsed.  The military sequences at the end are as complex, stark, and captivating as Saving Private Ryan.  The ""car mob"" scene is an amazing technical feat (watch the bonus features to see what they had to do to get a camera inside of the car for a long, complex, stunt-filled scene).People in other reviews are claiming Owen's acting is bland.  His acting is spot on; he plays a defeated man in a defeated world, and he's just trying to wake up to the possibility of hope as the film progresses.The sets and design are superb as well, showing a very realistic future, bleak though it may be.The film is a great study of foreground versus background as well (philosopher Slavoj Zizek says this the bonus features, but you're sure to notice before you get to him).  In normal, mundane scenes you can relate to, something disconcerting and shocking is typically in the background.  The film always draws you in with the comfortable and makes you squirm a little with the bleak future existing all around the scene.One final note is that the bonus features are amazing.  I typically hate bonus sections and watch a few uneven deleted scenes and eject the disk.  These, however, are smart and illuminate the literature of this film.  There are great looks the this future, politics, and some world renown philosophers weigh in on the issues.I must admit I've yet to read the book (it's in my shopping cart right now).  But as a film standing by itself, this is a must-see.  If you're looking for a sci-fi pic with car chases and kung fu, got with Bruckheimer.  If you want a cerebral, gritty, unflinching look at a sterile future, this is the film for you.",5,"Amazing Future, Amazing Film",1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,2013,"['film', 'technical', 'marvel', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'technical', 'George', 'Lucas', 'technical', 'where', 'big', 'green', 'screen', 'lots', 'FX', 'mean', 'cinematography', 'mathematics', 'shots', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'director', 'made', 'minimal', 'amount', 'cuts', 'film', 'result', 'long', 'realistic', 'shots', 'intricately', 'choreographed', 'rehearsed', 'military', 'sequences', 'end', 'are', 'complex', 'stark', 'captivating', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'car', 'mob', 'scene', 'amazing', 'technical', 'feat', 'watch', 'bonus', 'see', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'get', 'camera', 'car', 'long', 'complex', 'stunt-filled', 'scene', '.People', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'claiming', 'Owen', 'acting', 'bland', 'acting', 'spot', 'defeated', 'man', 'defeated', 'world', 'just', 'trying', 'wake', 'up', 'possibility', 'hope', 'film', 'progresses.The', 'sets', 'design', 'are', 'superb', 'well', 'showing', 'very', 'realistic', 'future', 'bleak', 'may', 'be.The', 'film', 'great', 'study', 'foreground', 'versus', 'background', 'as', 'well', 'Slavoj', 'Zizek', 'bonus', 'features', ""'re"", 'sure', 'notice', 'get', 'normal', 'mundane', 'scenes', 'can', 'relate', 'something', 'disconcerting', 'shocking', 'typically', 'background', 'film', 'always', 'comfortable', 'squirm', 'little', 'bleak', 'future', 'existing', 'scene.One', 'final', 'note', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'amazing', 'typically', 'hate', 'bonus', 'sections', 'watch', 'few', 'uneven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'eject', 'disk', 'however', 'are', 'smart', 'illuminate', 'literature', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'future', 'politics', 'world', 'renown', 'philosophers', 'weigh', 'issues.I', 'must', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'read', 'book', 'shopping', 'cart', 'right', 'now', 'film', 'standing', 'must-see', ""'re"", 'looking', 'sci-fi', 'pic', 'car', 'chases', 'kung', 'fu', 'got', 'Bruckheimer', 'want', 'cerebral', 'gritty', 'unflinching', 'look', 'sterile', 'future', 'film']",N/A
646802,AZ78HT7H9DVJG,B00005JP9X,LARRY,"[1, 3]","I cannot give a poignant review that would do justice to *Children of Men*, like K. Harris and other top reviewers here.  Just read theirs, they've said everything beautiful about this film.All I can say is that this film enchanted me from the beginning to the end.  I love films that cause me to think after the movie is over.  But this one caused me to think about it days after I saw it.Clive Owens plays Theo Faron, living in England...in 2027.  People around the world has stopped being able to reproduce children.  The youngest human was 18 but was murdered for refusing to do something.Immediately after this murder, Theo's estranged wife appears and pleads him to help her sneak in Kee, an African-American refugee to the ""other side"".  However, she must have travel permits/papers.  After a round of adventure that resulted in a death, Theo discovers that Kee is actually pregnant.  The first such pregnancy in almost 20 years.  Theo suddenly understands why Kee must go to the other side...into the safety of the Human Project, whose aim is to cure infertility.All I can say is that *Children of Men* presented such an issue that is worth intellectual discussion.  For many, the possibility of a world-wide infertility is impossible.  However, if it should ever happen, how would the world react?  And if a woman was to get pregnant, would she be used as a political weapon or as a medical guinea pig?  And are you willing to die to ensure the birth of a miracle?I cannot decide which scenes were my favorites.  I liked the abduction of Theo.  I liked the escape from the Fishes.  I liked the war scenes between the army and the militia.  Heck, I liked everything.

The whole atmosphere of bleakness and decay really got to me.The scenes at the abandoned elementary school were particularly moving. You see how things on earth are quickly rotted when no longer needed, when most everyone has given up hope, believing those things to be useless forever.One of the scariest moments occurred deep in the woods, at the hippie's house when their trespasser alarm went off. That alarm was one of the ugliest, most foreboding sounds I've ever heard. And I couldn't get it out of my head for a few days.Another memorable scene is when the good hippie woman is forced off the bus. The last we see of her is someone pulling a black bag over her head.The final scenes by the water were very troubling, desolate. But it is interesting to note that while the anti-gov't ""terrorists"" tried to steal the pregnant woman, using violence for the sake of violence and their cause, the government's military stood by in awe as she passed them among the ruins.  The gov't is not entirely evil then. I mean, it looks like they are mostly fighting against the terrorists, which is the right thing to do. But their behavior to the immigrants was very disburbing.  Life is valued in this society, but only if it meets the right conditions. New babies are valued, of course, but if you're an immigrant you're likely to be caged, seen as more animal than human.This movie is also full of sacrifice.

As Theo, played by Clive Owen, becomes gradually more involved in the transporting of the one pregnant woman from her starting point to, ultimately, what is meant to be her safe harbor destination, the Human Project--the group analyzing the basis for the worldwide epidemic of infertility--he is as well gradually exposed to increasingly greater danger from violent anti-government groups and the government militia themselves.Based on a novel of the same name by British writer P.D. James (an uncharacteristically science fiction work by a woman known for her mysteries), the film is directed by, interestingly, Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron who previously helmed one of the Harry Potter movies. Cuaron establishes a dark mood in the film not only by the events, steeped in violence, but also by a surfeit of smoke, fog, and dark gray skies.Here, your supposed friends can just as easily be your enemies and when the only man Theo can trust, Jasper (Michael Caine), is himself set upon by violent forces, Theo and Kee--the pregnant woman--have no choice but to flee.The film is really the odyssey of man in (and into) the future. Though filled with the sadness of violence, the world in 2027 is as well hopeful. This is illustrated in a beautiful scene in which Kee is in essence worshipped by those surrounding her as she walks through a crowd with the biggest surprise in 18 years accompanying her (you will have to see the film to understand what this means). Tragedy strikes at every turn, including at the end of the film, and although it may initially appear that the last image is hopeful, because of the obvious uncertainty of who is friend and who is foe, even that is called into question.This is a strong, thought provoking film that speaks directly to how we have come to destroy ourselves and what (one of) the ultimate consequences of this self-destructive behavior may be.Highly recommended.",4,Dark disturbing vision of near future,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,2186,"['Twenty', 'years', 'road', 'film', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'plagued', 'number', 'serious', 'ills', 'radiation', 'fallout', 'may', 'very', 'likely', 'account', 'other', 'ill', 'spotlighted', 'here', 'global', 'infertility', 'affecting', 'woman', 'alive.All', 'one', 'Theo', 'played', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'gradually', 'more', 'involved', 'transporting', 'one', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'starting', 'point', 'ultimately', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'safe', 'harbor', 'destination', 'Human', 'Project', 'group', 'analyzing', 'basis', 'worldwide', 'epidemic', 'infertility', 'as', 'well', 'gradually', 'exposed', 'increasingly', 'greater', 'danger', 'violent', 'anti-government', 'groups', 'government', 'militia', 'themselves.Based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'British', 'writer', 'P.D', 'James', 'uncharacteristically', 'science', 'fiction', 'work', 'woman', 'known', 'mysteries', 'film', 'directed', 'interestingly', 'Mexican', 'director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'who', 'previously', 'helmed', 'one', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'Cuaron', 'dark', 'mood', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'events', 'steeped', 'violence', 'also', 'surfeit', 'smoke', 'fog', 'dark', 'gray', 'skies.Here', 'supposed', 'friends', 'can', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'enemies', 'when', 'only', 'man', 'Theo', 'can', 'trust', 'Jasper', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'set', 'violent', 'forces', 'Theo', 'Kee', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'have', 'choice', 'flee.The', 'film', 'really', 'odyssey', 'man', 'future', 'filled', 'sadness', 'violence', 'world', '2027', 'as', 'well', 'hopeful', 'illustrated', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'Kee', 'essence', 'worshipped', 'surrounding', 'crowd', 'biggest', 'surprise', '18', 'years', 'accompanying', 'will', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'understand', 'what', 'Tragedy', 'strikes', 'turn', 'including', 'end', 'film', 'may', 'initially', 'appear', 'last', 'image', 'hopeful', 'obvious', 'uncertainty', 'who', 'friend', 'who', 'foe', 'even', 'called', 'question.This', 'strong', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'directly', 'how', 'have', 'come', 'destroy', 'what', 'one', 'ultimate', 'consequences', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'may', 'be.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Unfortunately, we never find out. That was a big let down.

A little mystery can be good for a story, but not one filled with such obvious political overtones. It just seemed like people were randomly attacking each other for no reason. Yes, I get the fact that there is an underground alliance trying to overthrow Britain's government but the audience doesn't actually ""witness"" any reason in the 2 hour film that warrants such drastic actions.

Thank you very much Universal Publicity -- not.Fortunately a friend forced the DVD on me.I won't argue over the plot complexities -- there really aren't any: in a world that is rapidly winding down Clive Owen suddenly finds himself custodian to the first pregnant woman in eighteen years.It's a chase movie, and in the hands of a less creative director this film would've given up in the first twenty minutes -- let's face it, the synopsis doesn't offer much hope for anything more than another ""Equilibrium"" style sci-fi action-fest.But Cuaron manages to keep the story moving through what could esily be a series of predictable sequences with some spectacularly original camera work and beautifully understated performances.  He emphasises character and texture, and the hard work pays off.Children Of Men is an excellent example of what a great director can do with some ordinary material.  Cuaron's dystopia is Bosnian: grey skies, crumbling infrastructure, and ethnic cleansing.  His long meandering camera moves are more like ""The Red and The White"" than anything SF cinema has produced; there are no sweeping establishing shots or dramatic futuristic vistas -- the camera literally walks through the carnage.  And while all the actors are good (usually great), the relationship between Julianne Moore and Clive Owen is just wonderful.I won't argue about the originality of the story, but the treatment was so beautifully realised that I fell for this one in the first ten minutes.

It convincingly brings us into the terrorist battlezones of the future, complete with immigrant holding pens and bleak cityscapes that are made all the more plausible by excellent camera handling, and a cold color scheme. The acting ranges from very good (Clive Owen) to so-so (Julianne Moore), but the cast mostly does a fine job with what are ultimately very thin roles. Michael Caine is endearing in an ultimately wispy role as a pot dealing comic artist. It's an eccentric little turn, but reads like a screenwriter piling on eccentricities for their own sake. As a result, in the end, Caine is pleasant, but forgettable.But, the real problem with Children of Men is a story line (not premise, mind you) that simply doesn't flow naturally, It is propelled from point to point by very artificial devices that speak mostly of poor plotting. Serendipitous events jar the characters along, coupled with dialogue that says too much -- with a ring of audience spoon-feeding. A good example of this is when Owen's character overhears a group of bad guys revealing what they did, and what they plan to do with Owen's character ""tomorrow."" It felt like a cheesy James Bond moment in which the villain explains his ""plan"" for no purpose other than to given Bond sufficient information to save himself. The script, sadly, has a number of these moments, and the result is a story that never quite coheres, and never lives up to its potential.What Children of Men gets very right, however, are those moments when we feel like this bleak future is very possible -- a fleeting glimpes of a New York City mushroom cloud, a bombing victim cradling her own arm, tanks assaulting a London high-rise.

It lacked pacing, and in my opinion, was just sometimes downright boring.Children of Men takes place in the near future, in a time when women have lost their ability to have babies. Consequently, the entire world falls apart. Sound like a stretch? Well, to me it was.However, before I become too critical of the movie, I will say that it was a very raw, very vivid film. And in some ways that's good, in other ways it isn't. For instance, at times, I just wanted them to push aside all of the ""thought-provoking"" ideas and get back to the movie.

The book delves into AI and the possibility of it being the next step in human evolution, but more importantly (as I read it) it addresses the question of why we're here and what our purpose is here on earth. While Kerr acknowledges our evolutionary underpinnings, he more importantly addresses the responsibility we have for our children and the meaning they provide to our lives.  The point of the movie, like the novel, is to delve into the way in which children provide meaning and purpose to our lives, and that if we continue to ignore our children's needs and to abuse and destroy our planet, that they, and thus we will cease to exist.  The movie does an excellent job of making that point in a very matter of fact and non-preachy way.  And while it's set in the future, it didn't have to be.  Much of what the movie portrays, the ethnic cleansing, the refuge camps, the civil strife, currently exists in numerous parts of the world.It goes without saying that the acting in the movie is excellent. Clive Owen and Michael Caine in particular, give fine performances.

While I expect many changes when you transform a book into a movie, this detail bothers me.Second peeve, throughout the whole movie cats, dogs and various wildlife seem attracted to Theo. They make a point of showing it with the cinematography so I kept thinking it would come up at the end why but it never did. Even my date kept expecting something more. While the story is complete in the main story sense I felt there were gaps that may have been edited out. I'm looking forward to special features when it comes out in rentals.I'd watch it again.

646831,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B00005JP9X,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[3, 5]","In the dreary, toxic, terrorist filled Britain circa 2027 of Alfonso Cuaron's ""Children of Men"" there is no hope...only despair and the television and billboards scream out at you about something called ""Quietus: YOU decide when."" In other words, the world is so rancid, the youngest person in the world, an 18 year old boy, has just died, there is mass infertility and basically the only choice left to you is when to die.Theo (a rumpled, emotionally depleted Clive Owen) was once a revolutionary, an activist but now he is merely a bureaucrat scratching out an existence when one day an old flame and current freedom fighter, Julian (Julianne Moore in a cameo) approaches him or more to the point has him kidnapped, bound and gagged and brought to her to ask a favor. This favor changes his life, gives him a little hope and introduces him to Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) a young black woman who is unbelievably with child.Adapted from a story by the excellent writer, P.D. James, ""Children of Men,"" offers more than a glimmer of hope and the idea that the world can be saved via a baby is a very Christian conceit. That this child is issued from the loins of, in the world of this film, a reviled, ""immigrant"" only makes the birth that much more resonant and thoughtful. There is a magical and very emotional scene towards the end of the film in which the revolutionaries are battling with the army, machine gun fire everywhere, bodies dropping like flies and Kee, Theo and the newborn baby descend a crumbling staircase and everything stops as army, revos and everyone one else realizes what Kee is carrying: a child yes but also a miracle, a beacon of hope, a hope for salvation. Interestingly enough, this scene, instead of being hokey, isn't because once Kee and child are outside the fighting immediately continues full bore: life goes on.""Children of Men"" is a cautionary film and one that is particularly creepy yet visionary because it is not set some 100 years but a mere 20 years hence.

It was pretty good though not as great as the critics seemed to say.  The plot was a little difficult to understand.

Even Britain itself is a hornets nest of pitched battles itself with more chaos than what is going on in Iraq.  The government seems to have been cracking down on ""illegal"" aliens; hunting them down.Julanne Moore is the rebel leader and she is gunned down rather early in the movie.  The other rebels are harboring an alien who is pregnant.  Clive Owen's character overhears the rebels plotting to kill him and the woman after she gives birth.

This movie isn't for a small child who would be confused by fast-moving plots (this one hardly moves that fast anyway) or for people who believe every human is inherently good and will remain so even in a crisis.Does this movie overbaringly push a politcal agenda? Perhaps. Yet this film, like all movies, only has the meaning that the viewer perceives. What I took from this film was how ugly the world really is, and how people will not stay civil when it all hits the fan. Is that depressing? It certainly is, but that's the world we live in.The movie is not without hope. The main character has succumbed to the bleakness of the world's current situation, but is given a new reason to fight on and persevere. The last scene were Theo and the girl are decending the stairs is breathtaking.Nowadays, it's hard to escape any form of entertainment with a political agenda, either real or perceived. But take from this movie something else.For those who thought this movie was too depressing, OPEN YOUR EYES. Watch and read the news.

646840,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JP9X,mirasreviews,"[1, 5]","""Children of Men"" is based on P.D. James' dystopian novel set in the year 2027, where all women have been mysteriously infertile for 18 years. This world without children has deteriorated into chaos, ostensibly because there is little reason to maintain our infrastructures or composure if humans have no future. While the rest of the world wages perpetual anarchic war, Great Britain musters on, its government and industry still functioning. Refugees who have escaped violence on other continents stream into Britain illegally, where the authorities do their best to contain the immigrants in camps and shanty towns. Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a middle-aged bureaucrat, is kidnapped on the streets of London by a revolutionary immigrant-rights group calling itself ""The Fishes"". Their leader is Theo's ex-wife Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore). who implores Theo to help her obtain transit papers for a young woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) who desperately needs to reach the coast.Julianne Moore's strong presence is the only thing that ""Children of Men"" has to recommend it. We don't see enough of her, and the rest of the film is completely forgettable. Too dull to be an action movie and too shallow to be anything else, ""Children of Men"" spends most of its energy wallowing in bleak, bluish, squalor. The production design draws attention to itself in every frame without ever managing to captivate. Squalor seems to be the principal theme. ""Children of Men"" is a chase movie, in which the characters are running away from one thing and toward another. That's fine for an action movie, but the action here consists simply of running or driving away from gunfire. The characters are woefully underwritten and the story simplistic. Oddly, ""Children of Men"" expresses its agenda in the background. Literally. The mistreatment of immigrants in the background of so many scenes conveys what are presumably director Alfonso Cuaron's views on immigration and open borders.The DVD (Universal 2007): Bonus features include deleted  scenes and 6 featurettes. ""The Possibility of Hope"" (26 min) are various doomsday predictions by social philosophers of the far left persuasion. In ""Children of Men Comments by Slavoj Zizek"" (6 min), social critic Zizek talks about what he sees as the true focus of the film, that being social oppression in capitalist systems. ""Under Attack"" ( 7 min) discusses the film's very long takes, with analysis of the opening sequence and  the car action sequence. ""Theo & Julian"" (5 min) discusses the characters.

Miller,"[4, 29]","Children of Men, as you may already know, is a film about a future society (2027), where like V for Vendetta, Britain is portrayed by the government as the last bastion of normalcy in the world, and let me tell you it's not doing so well.  Bombings, violence, and terrorism are common, apparently all due to the fact that several years prior, and this is the crucial idea, women stopped having babies.That's all just set-up though, as we haven't got to the plot of the movie, which is where Clive Owen's character, Theo comes in.  Theo is cynical about the world, and seems to be okay with just letting it go to the wayside, until his ex-wife meets up with him, and trusts in him a girl, more specifically a pregnant girl (which in a world without babies is pretty rare).  From there the adventure begins...Well, supposedly, because to me, this is sadly a simple, and obvious plot, and if it weren't for the exciting action sequences, particularly this one extremely long-shot sequence (which I will say is definitely impressive), then really I'd probably just give it two stars.  However, unlike most two-star films I sensed effort and some albeit limited success with that effort, thus my deeming this film as mediocre as a 3-star film can be (instead of the poorer 2-star).",3,Child... not Children,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1276,"['Children', 'Men', 'may', 'already', 'know', 'film', 'future', 'society', '2027', 'where', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'Britain', 'portrayed', 'government', 'last', 'bastion', 'normalcy', 'world', 'let', 'tell', 'not', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'Bombings', 'violence', 'terrorism', 'are', 'common', 'apparently', 'due', 'fact', 'several', 'years', 'prior', 'crucial', 'idea', 'women', 'stopped', 'having', 'babies.That', 'just', 'set-up', 'though', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'plot', 'movie', 'where', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'character', 'Theo', 'Theo', 'cynical', 'world', 'be', 'okay', 'just', 'letting', 'go', 'wayside', 'ex-wife', 'meets', 'up', 'trusts', 'girl', 'more', 'specifically', 'pregnant', 'girl', 'world', 'babies', 'pretty', 'rare', 'adventure', 'Well', 'supposedly', 'sadly', 'simple', 'obvious', 'plot', 'were', ""n't"", 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'particularly', 'one', 'extremely', 'long-shot', 'sequence', 'will', 'say', 'definitely', 'impressive', 'then', 'really', ""'d"", 'probably', 'just', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'However', 'most', 'two-star', 'films', 'sensed', 'effort', 'albeit', 'limited', 'success', 'effort', 'thus', 'deeming', 'film', 'as', 'mediocre', '3-star', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'instead', 'poorer', '2-star']",N/A

The story was told as if evolution COULD prevent fertility of humans in the very near future due to our experiments, corruptions and quick-fixes. Some may see the movie as political but that would apply to any war/end-of-the-world movie. It was almost like a movie outlining the consequences of our actions due to those who trying to prolong life, create more life, and alter life from its natural state. It was made out as a reality-like punishment from God for our evils. That's the basic point of many movies made but it's been a long time since I've seen one delivered quite as well. It ended up being more of a war movie than futuristic sci-fi. The quiet scenes were by far the best in the movie. I'd explain what it was but that would give away one of the most important parts of the movie. It's not as if it was a suspensful movie. Very dramatic actually and even spiritual in several scenes. Naturally, sad too. Talk about sacrifices to protect the cause!I wasn't fully satisfied with the ending but it still was better than I anticipated. As my husband said, it almost made it seem as if there was going to be a sequel (I hope not though because it would probably ruin the philosophical aspects, like what the 2nd & 3rd Matrix movies did for the first).

646855,A3689VFTV4R6ZX,B00005JP9X,Onix Franceschini,"[10, 13]","The Movie:The Apocalypse. A subject of many debates and dreaded talks. When will the world end, and how? No one will ever know, even though the Mayans had a good date for it (2012.) Children of Men is an apocalyptic thriller, but it differs from many of the ones out already. In this film, the apocalypse is brought upon us not by famine, or a plague, or the supernatural, but in the cease of human birth. The premise is of despair, and the film evokes it perfectly. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron, this films puts you in the middle of the collapse of unity in the world. Britain is the only place on Earth that is still under government control, and all of the illegal immigrants are considered refugees, which are being thrown into ""fugee zones,"" reminiscent of concentration camps during WWII. Theo (Clive Owen) gets involved in a mission by a group of renegade fighters lead by Julian (Juliane Moore,) Theo's ex-wife, who want to help secure the first pregnant woman in 18 years, who also happens to be a refugee. With the help of his best and only friend, Jasper (Michael Caine,) Theo will do all he can to save the life of the girl, in the process finding redemption for the ghosts of his past. The events that follow are nail-biting tense, and one of the final scenes in the film, which is an 8 minute long shot done in ONE take, help secure the tension of the film.  The vision that Cuaron puts on display is original and, in my opinion, amazing. You know it's the future, since you will see many neon signs and LCD displays all throughout the city, yet it's not too sci-fi, so you won't see flying cars or talking robots. Having this sense of realism mixed with sci-fi elements grounds the film, making it a more believable 2027. The visual effects here are extremely well crafted, specifically (minor spoiler) the birth of the baby. Also, add the amazing performances by Clive Owen, Juliane Moore, and Michael Caine, and you have a film for the ages.The Blu-Ray:Video:Man, as soon as I put this baby in my PS3, I knew I was in for a treat. The detail in the picture is outstanding! In the outdoor shots, you can see every branch in the trees on the outskirts of Jaspers house, and inside of his home, all of the objects are finely represented. I noticed some pretty deep blacks, and the colors are vivid and sharp. Even though this is a ""cold"" film, and the main pallete is ""steely,"" when it wants to shine, it does. 5 out of 5.Audio:This mix is just bombastic and awesome! The opening bombing scene had some amazingly deep bass, and the unique alarms and music in Jaspers home did as well. This film excels in dialogue, and it was always intelligible. Pans and directionality are perfect, and I never had an issue with volume control, which was an issue I had with ""The Incredible Hulk,"" which was also a Universal release. The film gave my bass a workout, so I say ""Thank you, Universal."" Another 5 out of 5.Overall, this film is one to be seen. After watching it at least 5 times, there were things that I missed from prior viewing. Watch and enjoy this stellar film, and reference quality Blu-Ray.",5,One of my favorite movies of all time hits the spot on Blu-Ray,1243987200,"06 3, 2009",2009,3107,"['Movie', 'Apocalypse', 'subject', 'many', 'debates', 'dreaded', 'talks', 'When', 'will', 'world', 'end', 'how', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'know', 'even', 'Mayans', 'had', 'good', 'date', '2012', 'Children', 'Men', 'apocalyptic', 'thriller', 'many', 'ones', 'out', 'already', 'film', 'apocalypse', 'brought', 'not', 'famine', 'plague', 'supernatural', 'cease', 'human', 'birth', 'premise', 'despair', 'film', 'perfectly', 'Directed', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'films', 'middle', 'collapse', 'unity', 'world', 'Britain', 'only', 'place', 'Earth', 'still', 'government', 'control', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'are', 'considered', 'refugees', 'are', 'being', 'thrown', 'fugee', 'zones', 'reminiscent', 'concentration', 'camps', 'WWII', 'Theo', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'involved', 'mission', 'group', 'renegade', 'fighters', 'lead', 'Julian', 'Juliane', 'Moore', 'Theo', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'want', 'help', 'secure', 'first', 'pregnant', 'woman', '18', 'years', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'refugee', 'help', 'best', 'only', 'friend', 'Jasper', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Theo', 'will', 'do', 'can', 'save', 'life', 'girl', 'process', 'finding', 'redemption', 'ghosts', 'past', 'events', 'follow', 'are', 'nail-biting', 'tense', 'one', 'final', 'scenes', 'film', '8', 'minute', 'long', 'shot', 'done', 'ONE', 'take', 'help', 'secure', 'tension', 'film', 'vision', 'Cuaron', 'display', 'original', 'opinion', 'amazing', 'know', 'future', 'will', 'see', 'many', 'neon', 'signs', 'LCD', 'city', 'not', 'too', 'sci-fi', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'flying', 'cars', 'talking', 'robots', 'Having', 'sense', 'realism', 'mixed', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'film', 'making', 'more', 'believable', '2027', 'visual', 'effects', 'here', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'crafted', 'specifically', 'minor', 'spoiler', 'birth', 'baby', 'Also', 'add', 'amazing', 'performances', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Juliane', 'Moore', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'have', 'film', 'ages.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'Video', 'Man', 'as', 'soon', 'put', 'baby', 'PS3', 'knew', 'was', 'treat', 'detail', 'picture', 'outstanding', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'can', 'see', 'branch', 'trees', 'outskirts', 'Jaspers', 'house', 'home', 'objects', 'are', 'finely', 'represented', 'noticed', 'pretty', 'deep', 'blacks', 'colors', 'are', 'vivid', 'sharp', 'Even', 'cold', 'film', 'main', 'pallete', 'steely', 'when', 'shine', '5', '5.Audio', 'mix', 'just', 'bombastic', 'awesome', 'opening', 'bombing', 'scene', 'had', 'amazingly', 'deep', 'bass', 'unique', 'alarms', 'music', 'Jaspers', 'home', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'excels', 'dialogue', 'was', 'always', 'intelligible', 'Pans', 'directionality', 'are', 'perfect', 'never', 'had', 'issue', 'volume', 'control', 'was', 'issue', 'had', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'was', 'also', 'Universal', 'release', 'film', 'gave', 'bass', 'workout', 'say', 'Thank', 'Universal', '5', '5.Overall', 'film', 'one', 'be', 'seen', 'watching', 'least', '5', 'times', 'were', 'things', 'missed', 'prior', 'viewing', 'Watch', 'enjoy', 'stellar', 'film', 'reference', 'quality', 'Blu-Ray']",N/A

I love the performances (Owen, Moore, Caine, etc., everyone marvelous, the story and the music, both rock and classical (John Taverner, Modern wrote the latter).  However, I hesitate to recommend it.  It isn't for the faint hearted.  It is a kind of ""Matrix"" or ""Dark City"" without the fantasy.  The idea that the world might really come to this point someday is sobering.  Margaret Underwood already wrote of a world where pregnancy is a miracle in her ""The Handmaid's Tale"".  However, her book centered on an well kept internal situation, and it has never been well done on film.  This story widens the scene to postapocryphalic (?) England where the things we live with are twisted and dirtied.  It has trusted friends who suddenly have their own shocking agendas; it has sacrifice by friends and family and it has hope for the future.  It has scenes where the cry of new baby quiets a war but also brings out the worst in people.Again, this is not for the faint hearted, but it might be a natural next step in our world.

Mankind decays slowly and faces its extinction as infertility has been the rule for over 18 years. Theo (Clive Owen), a disillusioned man, must escort through a sea of unimaginable adversities the most precious person: a pregnant woman.THE FILM is great at many levels. First, I'd say it is because of a great cast. Clive Owen is the perfect ""zombie"", a man who just lets himself go on with nothing to look forward to. His performance is unforgettable as a passive anti-hero who'll go all the way in order to accomplish his mission. Julianne Moore is also perfect as she gives a very quiet and underplayed performance as an activist hunted by the police (with whom Theo was once in love). Michael Caine shines (as usual) as an old hippie who now lives in the woods - in fact, his performance made me go back many times because it is so rich and physical... I really had to see it again several times at certain scenes.The Production Design is a landmark.Rarely we have seen such a puzzling look at the future. It is not Blade Runner. It is not Star Trek. It is not I, Robot. It is simply (if I try to define it) a version of the future which is incomplete... as (like i said before) mankind is slowly disappearing, the future becomes stagnant and reduced to minimum signs of utopia and evident signs of dystopia.The direction is precise and creative.The director really succeeds in giving us his full vision of the story, in scenes that are absolutely great. Using excruciatingly long takes, he really succeeds in giving us the true feel and the emotion behind the story. The car sequence is unbelievable. The old building shootout scene is unbelievable - just to chose two.The cinematography & camera work are perfect.From the composition of the shots to the light in each shot/scene... the camera movements, the focus... everything here is right. I loved the blood drops on the lenses. you really don't see things like that every day...The screenplay is near perfect.Well paced and well developed. It makes all journeys though ""urban chaos"" look like Disneyland. Characters and situations are very well written. I really felt the screenplay went where the story needed to go.Special effects are perfect.THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLY GREAT!!!!!This HD DVD edition is a combo disc meaning that the disc comes with two sides: side A is a HD DVD side. Side B is a regular DVD side you can play everywhere.Isn't it great?The extras are great:- Picture in Picture interviews with the director, crew and cast.

VERY DISTURBING! (another HD DVD exclusive feature).- The Possibility of Hope: a documentary exploring the themes you'll find in the film.- Under Attack: a short piece showing us how they made two very hard scenes (yes, the car sequence is there!).- Deleted scenes (the one in the Art Ministry is my favorite).- Theo & Julian: a short piece detailing the characters/actors relationship.- Futuristic Design: a short piece on the stunning visual aspects of the film (a must see!).- Commentary.This is one those titles that really show you how great HD DVD is.HD DVD is truly a great format.

The movie is set in the year 2027 and portrays a very believable future. The twist is that by 2027, all humans have become infertile. The youngest person on Earth is 18 years old and when people stopped having babies, the world fell apart. Clive Owen delivers an incredibly realistic performance in bringing to life this book by British mystery maven, P.D. James. Owen stars as Theo Faron, the one-time activist who has lost his cause and seemingly his passion for life as well. An important part of his past catches up with him when he is confronted by an extremist organization asking for help. Does he help this woman find help, when it means risking her life and his? And does his decision become easier or harder when he learns she is pregnant!?The movie has it all: action, humor, and a brilliant theme showcasing the relationship between faith and chance in our lives. The action was gripping and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. In Children of Men, they do not hold your hand through the story; things happen and they happen quickly. You will not get lost due to the speed, but be prepared. Things happen and you may not agree with them all, but by the end of the movie I hope you agree with me that everything that happened was necessary and well-timed.The laughs come at odd intervals, but seem to be just when you need them. The performances by Michael Caine (Jasper) and Peter Mullan (Syd) added the right about of levity to balance out the serious nature of the story. I could talk all day about Michael Caine alone and his iconic career in film, but I will leave it at this: he was fantastic yet again. Any elaboration I make on that would mean divulging a detail of the film that you should experience for yourself.Jasper even brings the theme (mentioned above) right to the audience. He tells a story about Theo's past and sets it up nicely. I love movies that can pull that off; I can't imagine it is easy.I have never been in a war zone. I can only imagine what it would be like to be in such a hostile environment. From what I would imagine, Children of Men nailed it. I have seen movies with similar scenes, but they have never felt as real. Maybe it is the political environment currently that added to the feeling in the movie.I liked Children of Men for many reasons.

It powerfully delivers a message that we're often in denial about, that of a coming grim dystopia if we continue to cynically (or despairingly) sleep-walk through our lives.  Much of the setting and the events of ""Children of Men"" are familiar to us - economic refugees being dehumanized and herded like cattle, so-called ""terrorists"" being blown away by state terrorists, decaying infrastructures, and a political economy that is serving only the elite.There is a moment in the film where someone cries out, ""The oceans are dying!""  Actually, the oceans are being killed by giant factory trawlers and pollution; still, rarely is that hugely important subject even mentioned amid the endless diversions and establishment propaganda that most films are.""Children of Men"" makes us look not just at the suffering of injustice and societal breakdown, but it also gives us a glimpse of hope.  When the baby is born, refugees and warring factions alike pause for a few moments and remember their own humanity.  And some of the characters, like that played by Michael Caine, maintain their sense of humor, defiance and solidarity through all the troubles of the world they (and we) inhabit.The DVD's extras are not to be missed.  They include remarks on the crises we face and possible solutions from thinkers like Naomi Klein and James Lovelock.  There are also descriptions of how the film crew created incredibly long and intricately choreographed scenes.  They achieved some things in shooting this film that many thought weren't possible.Also, the set designs and the music are fantastic.I'd like to see the director come back with a sequel, but have it be something totally original.  Rather than it be like a ""Terminator II"" action/adventure movie, he could create a film where the baby is growing up in a world where the people got it together, transcended the ruling tyrants, and were engaged in building a sustainable society where peace and justice are the norm.  As unreal or ""utopian"" as that may sound, it would probably take less effort to achieve than what it takes to continue with the ecocidal militarized police state that we've been developing.There is actually a documentary that makes real that sort of hopeful vision.

This film was simply aweful, and I don't say that often about films, as I usually find something good to say about the films I watch, because I am very particular to the films I'm interested in.  Subject material (or genre) is usually the only criteria I care about.  If I'm interested in the subject material, I'll check out the film.  I generally like sci-fi and/or apocalyptic films, so I checked this out because this film was billed as the ""new Millenium's 'Blade Runner'"".  Hogwash.  The only thing that would make this in the vein of ""Blade Runner"" would be the noir dystopia post-apocalyptic setting.  If you've seen the TV series ""Dark Angel"", you get the gist of the environment this is set in.However, here's the deal with this film (and story).  Instead of Blade Runner's Replicants, this story deals with the infertilization of human kind and then the sudden miracle of a illegal immigrant being pregnant and then giving birth.  Of course the police state is very fascist, and the heroes need to smuggle this woman and her baby to some sort of human experimental organization.The film is only 110 minutes long and only 10-15 minutes of the film near the end is worth watching.  The action scene in the streets and buildings of a bombed out city block or two.  But that's not what really ticked me off about the film.  Believe it or not, it's one of the extras on the DVD.  The 27 minute featurette ""The Possibility of Hope.""  This featurette features about every prominent European leftist telling the viewer just how bad and evil individualism, globalization, capitalism, and ownership of personal property is.  One of the main speakers is a ""Philosophy and Culture critic"".  Now if that don't tell you something, nothing will.  Someone paid to come up with and say anything and everything about how bad humanity is.  It was a disgusting piece to put on a DVD as an extra.  Even though it supposedly tied into the film somewhat, the piece was totally one-sided.  That's propaganda folks...and I ain't buyin'.  Not one voice of dissent in the piece.  They basically blamed every ill that plagues mankind (and on the earth, ie. global warming)...on mankind.  I couldn't hardly watch it...in fact, I didn't.  I just let it play in the background as I did something else.  This kind of thing happened once before with a DVD release.  The Running Man-SE had a left-wing hit piece on it that dealt with something, I can't even remember what, but it featured Ramsey Clark, one of America's most infamous America-haters, who takes the side of America's enemies every chance he gets.I'm gonna say right now to all these DVD companies, if you're going to put a featurette or documentary on a DVD that has political referrences, you better make it ""fair and balanced"".

Prepare to see a LOT of uses of the word ""Somehow"" in this review, because this movie is so full of unrealistic coincidences (especially for a sci-fi movie) that it annoys the hell out of me.Basically the last person on earth has died. Somehow this guy is idolized since there has somehow been a mass infertility rate for 18 years. Somehow he has a lot of fans. Somehow one of his ""fans"" killed him. We find this out in the beginning where numerous are gathered in a convenience store which somehow gets blown up (and we don't know how someone managed to somehow get a bomb in there.(Theo, a businessman who we don't know much about, was married to a beautiful wife played by Julianne Moore who is the head of a terrorist group somehow named ""The Fishes"". I did not make that up. Of all names for a terrorist group, she chose the name ""Fishes"". Society has collapsed in various parts of the world and, I'm about to use the dreaded ""S"" word again- somehow, London is the only place that soldiers on. Somehow, in the wake of all this infertility, a woman has miraculously gotten pregnant for unknown reasons. Thus ensues a ridiculously unrealistic story that almost never takes off.There, I've summed up the film, I can stop using the word ""somehow"" for a while.This film is well shot, I'll tell you that. It is interesting to look at, with its gloomy and depressing look that plays a character. That's really all I know I can say about this film that isn't negative. This film is just flat out awful. How it manages to get all these rave reviews baffles me. It's even in the IMDb Top 250, FFS. There's a good amount of cameos from good actors, yet they get killed off 5 minutes into their screentime to save money. There are tonnes of unrealistic coincidences that happen.

James novel The Children of Men holds that fertility has hit zero for nigh on two decades, and that as a result the world order is collapsing. Opening with the news that the youngest living person in the world has been murdered at the age of 18, it swiftly and skilfully establishes a dystopian vision of a near future Britain--a police state wherein society is just barely maintaining its fabric. Present day fears and tensions such as those surrounding terrorism and immigration are extrapolated to a terrifying endgame in a world without hope, and a quiet seaside town is transformed into a warzone. Stark and arresting in its imagery and with no holds barred representations of violence, some incredibly long and complicated continuous shot sequences add to a gritty documentary feel. Clive Owen's perfectly judged hero of the piece is a broken man who falls into the role of protector to what might be the last hope for the future of the human race, and as violence rages all around him, it's notable that he never once picks up a gun himself. From the central story through superb acting from a cast that includes some big names in fairly minor supporting roles, through to its powerful direction and cinematography, this film is a work of art that is quite literally stunning in every sense.--Adam ChamberlainRevelation Magazine",5,Children of Men: A World Without Children's Voices,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,1396,"['apocalyptic', 'premise', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'P.D', 'James', 'Children', 'Men', 'fertility', 'hit', 'zero', 'nigh', 'two', 'decades', 'result', 'world', 'order', 'collapsing', 'Opening', 'news', 'youngest', 'living', 'person', 'world', 'been', 'murdered', 'age', '18', 'swiftly', 'skilfully', 'dystopian', 'vision', 'near', 'future', 'Britain', 'police', 'state', 'wherein', 'society', 'just', 'barely', 'maintaining', 'fabric', 'Present', 'day', 'fears', 'tensions', 'such', 'surrounding', 'terrorism', 'immigration', 'are', 'extrapolated', 'terrifying', 'endgame', 'world', 'hope', 'quiet', 'seaside', 'town', 'transformed', 'warzone', 'Stark', 'arresting', 'imagery', 'barred', 'representations', 'violence', 'incredibly', 'long', 'complicated', 'continuous', 'shot', 'sequences', 'add', 'gritty', 'documentary', 'feel', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'perfectly', 'judged', 'hero', 'piece', 'broken', 'man', 'who', 'role', 'protector', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'last', 'hope', 'future', 'human', 'race', 'violence', 'notable', 'never', 'once', 'up', 'gun', 'central', 'story', 'superb', 'acting', 'cast', 'big', 'names', 'fairly', 'minor', 'supporting', 'roles', 'powerful', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'film', 'work', 'art', 'quite', 'literally', 'stunning', 'sense.', 'Adam', 'ChamberlainRevelation', 'Magazine']",N/A

This was an uninspired romp though the director's vision of a bleak future. There's no back story - except a mysterious reason for infertility. Man has simply given up, with no obvious research being done on the problem. Ignoring the fact that, 1) simultaneous worldwide infertility is a really, really long reach. 2) Every government on the planet collapsing at the same time (except England) is an even longer reach.  Good Science Fiction requires a solid foundation and a believable premise - this film has neither.""Blade Runner"" for this generation?  Not even close.  The ending was as much an anticlimax as could be anticipated from such an overhyped film.  Now, if we ignore the script, premise, plot and much of the acting, I'll agree that what's left is great. The sets, directing and photography were phenomenal.  The Nicholas Cage movie ""Snake Eyes"" used a single, long opening shot to establish the action and feel. This movie is composed primarily of that style of shooting - sometimes to such an extreme that it distracts from the movie (that's a good thing much of the time.)Except for the accents and vehicles, it could have been modern day Bosnia or any other war-torn local.

I always chalked that up to hyperbole...until I saw CHILDREN OF MEN.  It's been almost three weeks since I saw it...and feelings and moods and images from the film still revisit me from time to time.  It's a feeling that's pretty new to me, and I've seen 3000 or more films in my life.It's not that the film is perfect...I've certainly seen films that leave me more shaken, more entertained, more impressed or more moved to action.  But CHILDREN OF MEN soaked me in an atmosphere and a mood and a world in such a specific, complete manner that some of it's images are almost like sense memory to me now.  I think the last time I had a similar feeling was in about 1980 when I first saw David Lynch's THE ELEPHANT MAN, which left me so shaken that I had to go again and again in the same week.  I'm planning on seeing CHILDREN OF MEN again soon, and may have to go a third time.I don't think I need to rehash the basic plot...others have done that pretty well.  One thing I feel I must comment on is the criticism I've seen in a few places that there isn't any plot, or that we don't know what's going on in this futuristic society.  To me, that's almost laughable.  How many people wanted to know why the earth became the way it did in BLADE RUNNER?  Or SILENT RUNNING?  We accept the world presented to us.  I think part of the power of CHILDREN OF MEN is that it set in a not very distant future, where the world is turned upside-down...and yet it feels possible.  The landscapes, cityscapes, technology, clothing, etc. that we see look very familiar.  It feels like today, or maybe just next year.  And yet we don't recognize the society, the politics, etc.  It's deeply unsettling to see a ""future"" that feels so totally possible.  So bleak, and yet so credible.True, we don't know exactly why no one has had children in nearly two decades.  Would the narrative drive of this movie work better if we did know?  Would having that one little answer make the film suddenly perk to life for skeptical viewers?  I find it hard to believe.  I had no problem not knowing...I can fill that blank in for myself.  Otherwise, I think the socio-political climate in the Great Britain presented in the film is VERY easy to glean.  There's some easy to swallow exposition and then off we go with the film.It is the story of one man, Theo, played brilliantly by Clive Owen.  He looks weary, furrowed, troubled, smart, cynical, heroic, handsome, dirty, smelly.  It's probably too late for Oscar attention for him...but it's an Oscar worthy performance.  He's so easy to like, and yet he's very much an anti-hero.  But during the film, we see him come to life...to suddenly have something to live for.  That's what the movie is about.  Not plot twists.  Not this happened, then this, then this.  It's about one man (living in a society where he already knows the background of what's happened...why would the film tell US?) who is just going through the motions of living.  Then some events unfold that jolt him back into engaging in the world and actually working to make a difference.  It's effective.Also, I have to address the violence and some viewer's criticism of it.  Yep, it's violent.  It's graphic, but not over the top.  Lots and lots of people die, but the camera doesn't linger over the nasty results.  In fact, people die most often on the fringes of the film.  The camera pans, and just as it passes someone in the background, they drop from a gunshot and are seen no more.  It's highly effective in giving us a sense of the sudden death that awaits in this new society.There are many specific parts of the film that I loved.  Michael Caine's joyful performance.  Theo's ongoing problems with footwear (don't ask).  The way in which the midwife character in the film is suddenly yanked out of the story (the whole scene showing Theo's arrival at the detention camps is amazingly well done...just look out the bus window as the scenes roll by).  The scene when Kee's secret is first revealed to the general populace and their reaction.  It's all stunning and moving.The movie is very gray, and bleak.  Yet there are just enough glimmers of hope to make it bearable.  Theo's redemption alone make it worth taking this difficult journey.  I felt exhausted after watching it...but also so impressed with the craftsmanship and the feelings I was grappling with.So now I sound like a real touchy-feely guy.  That's not me!  But for CHILDREN OF MEN, the best thing I can say is that it was haunting.  This is a film that you must see and experience for yourself.  I guess you might not like it...others didn't...but if you do like it, you'll be SO glad you didn't miss it.

During the days the only time you see kids is if you pass by a school. Even on the weekends there is a noticable lack of kids. Analogous to a yuppie supermarket versus the nearby Spanish speaking low priced store. No kids in the yuppie aisles of wines and frozen food, lots of choices, but no kids. Now image a world where the youngest person, who is 18 dies. That is the setting.The world is more than a bit threadbare, fraided about the edges, worn and tired. It is a rough, mean, mean spirited, gated community rules the world sort of place. The gap between the haves and have-nots reaches it's logical end with the havenots in refugee camps and the haves in armored trains. It is a dismal and all too probable future, projecting the current concentration of wealth and power curves into the not-very-distant 2027, next generation.I've seen first hand the problem of everything everywhere belongs to someone when we lived for a decade in a converted bookmobile and travelled looking for a place to park. I've not only seen this greed in others, but looked at it in my own heart. Grab and hold, possess and be possessed by things, let's get while the getting is good, only the stupid or incapable don't run the rat race towards more and better and mine.Movies like this ought to be taken as watchmen on the city wall, yelling that the hoofed hordes dust cloud is approaching. The problem is that everyone closing their own gate and the public square suffers, the balance of private property and public falls badly out of balance, and the I's win. This is the viewpoint of the movie, rampant indiividualism, fear of the outsider, power-force-police-guns and cages rule the ""unruly"". it is this image of the world as nothing but private property, no public goods, no public square, no unification or common interests among the various economic classes, that makes this movie powerful. it is the prediction of what might be if common trends continue as they are today.I liked the movie, it would be worthwhile to look for a good movie discussion forum where people are thinking, interacting with the movie and each other. And put more time into thinking consistently and logically about the problems outlined and presented in it. Things like this ought to stimulate and drive us towards each other in order to solve and ward off the world that no one really wants to live in.but the question remains with me. i don't want to live in such a world, but will my kids or grandkids have to? it's my hope that movies like this slow down the approaching hoofbeats of such a world, just a little bit. that is why the movie is ultimately positive and redeeming, the main character does left his apathy and dies getting the baby and her mom to safety. it is this character developmental as humanity struggles with it's own sad future that gives us hope even in the midst of such dismal evil.",5,"i won't want to live there, will my kids?",1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,3684,"['First', 'i', 'science', 'fiction', 'i', 'have', 'i', 'was', 'child', 'i', 'also', 'dysutopic', 'visions', 'future', 'so', 'added', 'listmania', 'topic.Second', 'get', 'rent', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'commentaries', 'are', 'not', 'usually', 'shovelware', 'rather', 'thoughtful', 'pieces', 'put', 'together', 'DVD', 'interviews', 'philosophers', 'other', 'thinkers', 'movie', 'ideas.There', 'are', 'lots', 'good', 'reviews', 'talking', 'filming-spectacular', 'actors-excellent', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'gray', 'long', 'haired', 'pot', 'smoking', 'hippy', 'brain', 'dead', 'wife-more', 'cute', 'few', 'how', 'movie', 'bite', 'off', 'more', 'can', 'really', 'chew', 'matter', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'particularly', 'good', 'worth', 'reading.I', 'first', 'encountered', 'world', 'kids', 'several', 'summers', 'walking', 'China', 'days', 'only', 'time', 'see', 'kids', 'pass', 'school', 'Even', 'weekends', 'noticable', 'lack', 'kids', 'Analogous', 'yuppie', 'supermarket', 'nearby', 'Spanish', 'speaking', 'low', 'priced', 'store', 'kids', 'yuppie', 'aisles', 'wines', 'frozen', 'food', 'lots', 'choices', 'kids', 'Now', 'image', 'world', 'where', 'youngest', 'person', 'who', '18', 'dies', 'setting.The', 'world', 'more', 'bit', 'threadbare', 'fraided', 'edges', 'worn', 'tired', 'rough', 'mean', 'mean', 'spirited', 'gated', 'community', 'rules', 'world', 'sort', 'place', 'gap', 'haves', 'have-nots', 'logical', 'end', 'havenots', 'refugee', 'camps', 'haves', 'armored', 'trains', 'dismal', 'too', 'probable', 'future', 'projecting', 'current', 'concentration', 'wealth', 'power', 'curves', 'not-very-distant', '2027', 'next', 'generation.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'hand', 'problem', 'everything', 'everywhere', 'someone', 'when', 'lived', 'decade', 'converted', 'bookmobile', 'travelled', 'looking', 'place', 'park', ""'ve"", 'not', 'only', 'seen', 'greed', 'others', 'looked', 'own', 'heart', 'Grab', 'hold', 'possess', 'be', 'possessed', 'things', 'let', 'get', 'getting', 'good', 'only', 'stupid', 'incapable', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'rat', 'race', 'towards', 'more', 'better', 'mine.Movies', 'ought', 'be', 'taken', 'watchmen', 'city', 'wall', 'yelling', 'hoofed', 'dust', 'cloud', 'approaching', 'problem', 'everyone', 'closing', 'own', 'gate', 'public', 'square', 'suffers', 'balance', 'private', 'property', 'public', 'falls', 'badly', 'balance', 'win', 'viewpoint', 'movie', 'rampant', 'indiividualism', 'fear', 'outsider', 'power-force-police-guns', 'cages', 'rule', 'unruly', 'image', 'world', 'nothing', 'private', 'property', 'public', 'goods', 'public', 'square', 'unification', 'common', 'interests', 'various', 'economic', 'classes', 'movie', 'powerful', 'prediction', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'common', 'trends', 'continue', 'are', 'today.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'look', 'good', 'movie', 'discussion', 'forum', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'thinking', 'interacting', 'movie', 'other', 'put', 'more', 'time', 'thinking', 'consistently', 'logically', 'problems', 'outlined', 'presented', 'Things', 'ought', 'stimulate', 'drive', 'towards', 'other', 'order', 'solve', 'ward', 'off', 'world', 'one', 'really', 'live', 'in.but', 'question', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'such', 'world', 'will', 'kids', 'grandkids', 'have', 'hope', 'movies', 'slow', 'down', 'approaching', 'hoofbeats', 'world', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'why', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'positive', 'redeeming', 'main', 'character', 'left', 'apathy', 'getting', 'baby', 'mom', 'safety', 'character', 'developmental', 'humanity', 'own', 'sad', 'future', 'hope', 'even', 'midst', 'such', 'dismal', 'evil']",N/A
646887,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JP9X,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Children of Men (Alfonso Cuaron, 2006)I have to say up front that I was not a big fan of the book upon which this movie is based. Thus, I approached the film with a bit of trepidation; sometimes mediocre books make for great films, but more often than not, they don't. The good news is that Children of Men is better than the novel upon which it is based; the bad news is that it's probably not as good as it could have been.Cuaron (who holds three Academy Award nominations, two of them for writing, none for directing) here gives us the story of Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a minor government functionary whose ex, Julian (Julianne Moore), is involved with a resistance group in a near-future London where women have lost the ability to bear children. (As the movie opens, the youngest person on the planet, at eighteen years and change, is killed in South America.) Julian contacts Theo and asks if he can pull some strings to get a young black refugee out of Britain and into the arms of the Human Project, a much wider-ranging revolutionary group based outside the country. (Britain has become a racists' paradise; even black citizens, it is inferred, are suffering the persecution that the ""'fugees"" suffer openly.) Theo goes about it halfheartedly until he finds out the reason this particular girl is so important: she's the first woman in more than eighteen years to become pregnant.Owen and Moore both tend to be hit-or-miss actors, but they perform capably here. It helps that they're backed up by a fantastic stable of actors; Michael Caine is excellent as always, and the wonderful Peter Mullan, in a small role, absolutely steals the show. Cuaron turns an emotionless, overly talky book into a credible thriller. It's still a bit on the talky side, but is definitely faster-moving than the book.

646888,A277MYG7MQTKYW,B00005JP9X,Robert Blenheim,"[1, 1]","Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's ""Children of Men"" is an adaptation of the P.D. James dystopian novel about the breakdown of all social institutions when the human race ceases the ability to procreate and faces the likelihood of its own extinction.Chaos and civil war overtake the globe, and, in Great Britain, Orwellian fascism is the only order left as refugees are imprisoned in cages, the middle class disintegrates, terrorist acts (usually by the government) are a daily occurrence, and underground rebels fight on for revolution, trying to maintain some futile hope.While the film's events occur in 2027, 20 years in the future, the film becomes more of a comment on the Now with its pro-war stance by the government and ""Homeland Security"" to protect us all. But the film transcends politics to focus on its human level, specifically on the character of Theo Farin (played to existential perfection by Clive Owen) who fatefully goes through a rite-of-passage similar to Bogie in ""Casablanca"" - that of a man who had pulled himself away from involvement in a war-torn world finding himself now beginning to discover a newly-reborn idealism.Brilliantly, many references to key art works of the 20th Century fill the film. e.g., musical references from rock and classical works: The Beatles, Pink Floyd, iconic rock songs -- along with Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Penderecki and Gustav Mahler, whose first song in the ""Kindertotenlieder"" (""Songs for Dead Children"") is quoted. Images are staged in the style of great paintings, and, most importantly, Picasso's ""Guernica"" becomes the major symbolic icon of the film, with the cinematography drained of bright colors to convey perfectly the film's atmosphere.But over all, Cuar&oacute;n's directing is breathtaking, with his long Wellsian single-takes that truly nail the viewer directly into the world of the film. This is a masterpiece, and ultimately not one of bleakness but of hope, and one of the truly top intellectual and emotional experiences of 2006.",5,A TERRIFYING DYSTOPIAN VISION NOT FAR OFF,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,2001,"['Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'Children', 'Men', 'adaptation', 'P.D', 'James', 'dystopian', 'novel', 'breakdown', 'social', 'institutions', 'when', 'human', 'race', 'ability', 'procreate', 'likelihood', 'own', 'extinction.Chaos', 'civil', 'war', 'overtake', 'globe', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Orwellian', 'fascism', 'only', 'order', 'left', 'refugees', 'are', 'imprisoned', 'cages', 'middle', 'class', 'disintegrates', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'usually', 'government', 'are', 'daily', 'occurrence', 'underground', 'rebels', 'fight', 'revolution', 'trying', 'maintain', 'futile', 'hope.While', 'film', 'events', 'occur', '2027', '20', 'years', 'future', 'film', 'more', 'comment', 'Now', 'pro-war', 'stance', 'government', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'protect', 'film', 'politics', 'focus', 'human', 'level', 'specifically', 'character', 'Theo', 'Farin', 'played', 'existential', 'perfection', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'fatefully', 'rite-of-passage', 'similar', 'Bogie', 'Casablanca', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'pulled', 'away', 'involvement', 'war-torn', 'world', 'finding', 'now', 'beginning', 'discover', 'newly-reborn', 'idealism.Brilliantly', 'many', 'references', 'key', 'art', 'works', '20th', 'Century', 'fill', 'film', 'e.g.', 'musical', 'references', 'rock', 'classical', 'works', 'Beatles', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'iconic', 'rock', 'songs', 'Shostakovich', 'Prokofiev', 'Penderecki', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'first', 'song', 'Kindertotenlieder', 'Songs', 'Dead', 'Children', 'quoted', 'Images', 'are', 'staged', 'style', 'great', 'paintings', 'most', 'importantly', 'Picasso', 'Guernica', 'major', 'symbolic', 'icon', 'film', 'cinematography', 'drained', 'bright', 'colors', 'convey', 'perfectly', 'film', 'atmosphere.But', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'directing', 'breathtaking', 'long', 'Wellsian', 'single-takes', 'truly', 'nail', 'viewer', 'directly', 'world', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'ultimately', 'not', 'one', 'bleakness', 'hope', 'one', 'truly', 'top', 'intellectual', 'emotional', 'experiences', '2006']",N/A

Granted, they haven't reached the fever pitch level displayed in the movie, but that's just a formality - we're not that far away from the dark landscape of CHILDREN OF MEN.I found myself drawing so many comparisons to modern day society as I watched the film.  The enviromental decay depicted in it made me think of what we are currently doing to our planet; a protest march through an immigrant concentration camp made me think of the current Palestinian crisis; random klllings of people interned in the camp as they attempted to run across a street reminded me of similar killings in Sarajevo, Bosnia during the height of its ethnic war; the abundance of dogs everywhere in the film as companions to lonely people reminded me of New York City, where so many people have dogs in tiny little apartments to cope with their lonliness (in a city of 8 million), etc.I've often felt artists are the great prophets of society.

Although much of it was seamlessly implemented throughout the film, the birth of the baby was done very poorly and looked obviously fake. I do not know why the director decided to show the actual birth, when a sequence of shots that implied as much would have sufficed.My second problem was some of the dialogue. The story was amazing, but some of the dialogue did not really flow with the scenes, or was just plain weak or awkward.I think the director did a great job though and paid great attention to detail; the atmosphere and themes were very profound. The part at the interment camp in the final act was an amazing bit of cinema; gripping, terrifying, grim.4/5!",4,"Almost a masterpiece, hampered by CGI and dialogue issues",1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,783,"['C.O.M', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'fell', 'short', 'being', 'timeless', 'great', 'due', 'two', 'major', 'gripes', 'First', 'CGI', 'much', 'was', 'seamlessly', 'implemented', 'film', 'birth', 'baby', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'poorly', 'looked', 'obviously', 'fake', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'director', 'decided', 'show', 'actual', 'birth', 'when', 'sequence', 'shots', 'implied', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed.My', 'second', 'problem', 'was', 'dialogue', 'story', 'was', 'amazing', 'dialogue', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'flow', 'scenes', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'weak', 'awkward.I', 'think', 'director', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'paid', 'great', 'attention', 'detail', 'atmosphere', 'themes', 'were', 'very', 'profound', 'part', 'interment', 'camp', 'final', 'act', 'was', 'amazing', 'bit', 'cinema', 'gripping', 'terrifying', 'grim.4/5']",N/A
646891,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B00005JP9X,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","Every so often, you see a film that you know, instantly, is a classic.  This film is of that kind of quality:  it portrays a future world - an exaggeration of the present - that raises deep questions, is emotionally moving, and full of realistic action that adds to the themes.  In my opinion, this film is on the level of The Day the Earth Stood Still or Forbidden Planet, but it addresses current crises, from global economic breakdown and emigration to personal identity in a world gone wrong.  I was utterly riveted from the first minutes of the film, was moved at the plight of the mysterious child, and was inspired to wonder at what my children will face.I will try not to play the spoiler, but it is well known that this is about a dystopia that has arisen because suddenly, for reasons that no one can fathom, all women in the world have been infertile for nearly 20 years.  The sense of crisis at the demise of the human race is palpable in the chaos that has resulted:  the economic order is breaking down, illegal immigrants are hunted and forced into lawless ghettos, and human rights no longer exist except for a tiny slice of the elite population.  Gangs roam the countryside, the security apparatus of the state has few civil limits placed on it, and normal citizens are retreating into protected or hidden enclaves while radical activists seek to foment revolution.  My kids were appalled and frightened at this vision and watched with silent fascination, afterwards sparking a long discussion of where the world is headed for them.  We watched it twice, one viewing after the other.The central character, Dylan, is a broken man; he has given up and become cynical about his ideals, drinking for solace rather than contemplating action.  He is watching the world deteriorate around him, losing his empathy and unable to look ahead.  Then, his former lover - the mother of his deceased child - kidnaps him, asking for help.  What ensues is an adventure that renews his faith in humanity and the future, all the while highlighting the brutal machinations of those around him, who want to control what could be the savior of humanity.  He is a normal guy, thrust into what will become greatness.  I completely believed it, to the point that I got choked up at the climax.There are also some excellent commentaries with the version that I bought (2 disks of region 2).  There are documentaries with philosophers (e.g. Lovelock)  and  journalists (Naomi Kline, of whom I am a fan even though I am a moderate conservative) that are quite thought provoking.  Of course, there are also insipid promotional materials (""It was wonderful working with everyone""), but it is worth a look.Recommended with enthusiasm.

646892,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JP9X,Robert Moore,"[13, 17]","By any measure this is one of the finest dystopian works of art ever made.  It easily takes its place alongside other visions of the future such as novels such as 1984, FAHRENHEIT 451, and BRAVE NEW WORLD and films such as BLADE RUNNER and BRAZIL.  But unlike most of these other dystopian masterpieces, CHILDREN OF MEN ends on a hopeful, mildly optimistic note.The movie, set approximately 20 years in the future, begins shockingly with an announcement on television news that the world's youngest person has died at age 18.  A few seconds later the fast food place on whose TV we have been watching the news is destroyed by a terrorist bomb.  The two shocking events set the tone for the rest of the film.  We get a picture of a society in rapid decline, a dying world in which one widely advertised project is Quietus, a reference to the peace that Hamlet might receive if the fear of an afterlife did not keep him from suicide.  In this instance it is indeed a medication for ending one's life.  The film is set in England, which is the last orderly spot on earth and which has become both armed encampment and police state, struggling both to control the populace at home and keep the rest of the world out.  The world crisis has been created by the sudden infertility of all the women in the world.  I normally would hestitate to reveal the next detail, but since advertisements for the movie have been giving it away there is no point in playing coy.  Theo, played by Clive Owen, is recruited to help assist a young black immigrant girl to a location where she can escape from England by vote.  The reason she is so important is simple:  she is pregnant.I won't spoil anymore of the plot.  I think this is a film that is best seen with minimal knowledge.  I will say that I have never seen a film that is more viscerally real than this one.  There are numerous action sequences that feel so realistic that they almost feel real than rigged.  This is not typical movie special effects, which usually are exaggerated to make it more theatrical.  The action is more muted, but also vastly more realistic, so that you almost feel that it is happening around you.  It is not always an easy movie to watch.  As Theo and Kee, the young girl played wonderfully by newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey, wend their way through the chaos around them, you feel at times that the world is on the verge of collapse.  Some here have criticized the ending.  I found it moving and deeply touching, as well, as I mentioned above, quietly optimistic.Almost everything about this movie stands out.  The design of the film is outstanding.  It feels both futuristic and yet still very much like the world we live in now.  The cinematography is outstanding and the special effects as good as you will see without using CGI (there was CGI, but what I'm praising are the non-CGI effects).  The direction by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n is deft throughout and on the heels of such diverse successes as Y TU MAM&Aacute; TAMBI&Eacute;N, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN (still by far the best film in that series), and THE LITTLE PRINCESS further establishes himself as one of the world's most fascinating directors.  And the acting is impeccable.  Clive Owen is simply one of the world's finest actors and this is his finest performance yet.  The film is buttressed by a number of supporting performances.  Although he hasn't yet had a break out performance to establish his popular reputation, Chiwetel Ejiofor has through a number of fascinating performances established himself as one of the worlds most versatile and gifted actors (try watching this film along with his performances in SERENITY, KINKY BOOTS, and DIRTY PRETTY THINGS and you'll get an idea of his talent and range).  Michael Caine is superb as a hippy journalist.I rarely like to comment on DVD special features because I don't think most people watch them and partly because it is never why I buy a DVD anyway.  But this disc has some of the best special features I've ever seen.  They explain how they performed some of the amazing special effects in the film.  I definitely recommend watching them.Just a word or two about astonishingly low rating this film is getting here on Amazon.  If this isn't a five star movie, the rating makes no sense.  Critics have been beside themselves in raving about this movie and ordinary fans and viewers are not giving this low ratings elsewhere.  On IMDB.com, for instance, it currently has a 8.1 User Rating and is #149 on the list of the 250 most highly rated films.  It really is that good.  I can only speculate on who is giving it such low ratings, but let me caution potential viewers that this is not a blockbuster adventure film.  If your idea of a great movie is SAHARA or NATIONAL TREASURE, you will find this to be a shocking disappointment.  But if you enjoy more artistically rendered films, like art films, and like more serious rather than merely commercial films, you will love this.  In my opinion it was, along with PAN'S LABYRINTH and THE LIVES OF OTHERS, one of the three truly great films of 2006 (though it went into general release in 2007, it had a limited 2006 release).  If you like intelligent, serious, noncommercial films, this will leave you stunned.",5,A haunting and overwhelming dystopian vision of the future,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,5263,"['measure', 'one',

646894,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JP9X,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","***1/2One of these days, some innovative filmmaker is going to make a movie set in a future where the skies are crystalline blue, governments treat their citizens with decency and respect, and people live in relative harmony with both technology and one another. But until that time we have ""Children of Men,"" yet another dystopian vision of what life might be like in the not-too-distant future - and, as usual, it ain't a pretty picture.Based on a novel by P.D. James, ""Children of Men"" takes place in the year 2027, a time in which the world has been thrown into chaos by war and disease, and the entire human race has been infertile for 18 years. Only Merry Olde England has, for some reason, been able to escape the generalized destruction (though not the infertility). In a bid to protect the nation from hostile outside elements, the government has begun to round up all its illegal aliens, locking them into cages and deporting them off the island (when it isn't slaughtering them outright).The overrated Clive Owens plays a Ministry of Energy bureaucrat who, much against his will, finds himself caught up in a plot to transport a young pregnant woman - the world's first since 2009 - to a place of safety so she can hopefully help to restart the otherwise doomed human race (although one wonders how a single child in the world will effectuate that outcome).""Children of Men"" has much to recommend it. It has a strong sense of time and place, with a look that is just right for its subject matter. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has drained most of the color out of the picture, and director Alfonso Cuaron has filmed the scenes with a great deal of immediacy and excitement. Cuaron certainly knows how to gin up the suspense and to make us feel like participants in the action.But the film is less successful at exploring the profound implications of its theme. James has come with an unusually intriguing premise - just what would life be like if we knew our species was going to be extinct in less than a hundred years - but the film doesn't do anything all that interesting with it. Instead, the movie turns into a surprisingly conventional ""chase"" movie, with characters running for their lives from hostile parties amid a ceaseless hail of explosions and bullets. Just why is it that dystopian dramas - from ""Fahrenheit 451"" to ""Logan's Run"" to ""The Island"" to ""Minority Report"" to ""The Imposter"" to ""Paycheck,"" to name just a handful - all feel the need to adhere to this tired narrative formula? Every so often, the film zeroes in on its theme, yielding, by far and away, its most effective moments: people sobbing uncontrollably as they watch a news story relating the sudden death of the world's youngest person; an art collector amassing many of the world's greatest sculptures and paintings even though he knows that in less that a hundred years there will be nobody left to appreciate them; a former midwife, sitting in an abandoned schoolroom, recounting with soul-wrenching sadness the day she realized children would no longer be gracing the world with their presence; combatants momentarily stopping their gunfire to stare awestricken at a newborn babe. We yearn for more of these psychologically astute and insightful moments, but, alas, this is not to be, as Cuaron and his team of writers pour on the action scenes pretty much at the expense of everything else.Owens, Michael Caine (in the annoyingly stereotypical role of an aging eccentric hippie) and Julianne Moore are the ""name"" players in the cast, but the most powerful performances come from Claire-Hope Ashitey as the pregnant woman and Pam Ferris as the person assigned to be her midwife.""Children of Men"" is a good film that could have been a great one were it not redolent of so many likeminded movies that have come before it.",3,very good but somewhat formulaic,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,3821,"['***1/2One', 'days', 'innovative', 'filmmaker', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'set', 'future', 'where', 'skies', 'are', 'crystalline', 'blue', 'governments', 'treat', 'citizens', 'decency', 'respect', 'people', 'live', 'relative', 'harmony', 'technology', 'one', 'time', 'have', 'Children', 'Men', 'yet', 'dystopian', 'vision', 'what', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'not-too-distant', 'future', 'usual', 'ai', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'picture.Based', 'novel', 'P.D', 'James', 'Children', 'Men', 'place', 'year', '2027', 'time', 'world', 'been', 'thrown', 'chaos', 'war', 'disease', 'entire', 'human', 'race', 'been', 'infertile', '18', 'years', 'Only', 'Merry', 'Olde', 'England', 'reason', 'been', 'able', 'escape', 'generalized', 'destruction', 'not', 'infertility', 'bid', 'protect', 'nation', 'hostile', 'outside', 'elements', 'government', 'begun', 'round', 'up', 'illegal', 'aliens', 'locking', 'cages', 'deporting', 'off', 'island', 'when', ""n't"", 'slaughtering', 'outright', '.The', 'overrated', 'Clive', 'Owens', 'Ministry', 'Energy', 'bureaucrat', 'who', 'much', 'will', 'caught', 'up', 'plot', 'transport', 'young', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'world', 'first', '2009', 'place', 'safety', 'can', 'hopefully', 'help', 'restart', 'otherwise', 'doomed', 'human', 'race', 'one', 'how', 'single', 'child', 'world', 'will', 'effectuate', 'outcome', 'Children', 'Men', 'much', 'recommend', 'strong', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'look', 'just', 'right', 'subject', 'matter', 'Cinematographer', 'Emmanuel', 'Lubezki', 'drained', 'most', 'color', 'picture', 'director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'great', 'deal', 'immediacy', 'excitement', 'Cuaron', 'certainly', 'how', 'gin', 'up', 'suspense', 'make', 'feel', 'participants', 'action.But', 'film', 'less', 'successful', 'exploring', 'profound', 'implications', 'theme', 'James', 'come', 'unusually', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'just', 'what', 'would', 'life', 'be', 'knew', 'species', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'extinct', 'less', 'hundred', 'years', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'interesting', 'Instead', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'conventional', 'chase', 'movie', 'characters', 'running', 'lives', 'hostile', 'parties', 'ceaseless', 'hail', 'explosions', 'bullets', 'Just', 'why', 'dystopian', 'dramas', 'Fahrenheit', '451', 'Logan', 'Run', 'Island', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Imposter', 'Paycheck', 'name', 'just', 'handful', 'feel', 'need', 'adhere', 'tired', 'narrative', 'formula', 'Every', 'so', 'often', 'film', 'zeroes', 'theme', 'yielding', 'far', 'away', 'most', 'effective', 'moments', 'people', 'sobbing', 'uncontrollably', 'watch', 'news', 'story', 'relating', 'sudden', 'death', 'world', 'youngest', 'person', 'art', 'collector', 'amassing', 'many', 'world', 'greatest', 'sculptures', 'paintings', 'even', 'less', 'hundred', 'years', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'nobody', 'left', 'appreciate', 'former', 'midwife', 'sitting', 'abandoned', 'schoolroom', 'recounting', 'soul-wrenching', 'sadness', 'day', 'realized', 'children', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'gracing', 'world', 'presence', 'combatants', 'momentarily', 'stopping', 'gunfire', 'stare', 'awestricken', 'newborn', 'babe', 'yearn', 'more', 'psychologically', 'astute', 'insightful', 'moments', 'alas', 'not', 'be', 'Cuaron', 'team', 'writers', 'pour', 'action', 'pretty', 'much', 'expense', 'everything', 'else.Owens', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'annoyingly', 'stereotypical', 'role', 'aging', 'eccentric', 'hippie', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'are', 'name', 'players', 'cast', 'most', 'powerful', 'performances', 'come', 'Claire-Hope', 'Ashitey', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'Pam', 'Ferris', 'person', 'assigned', 'be', 'midwife', 'Children', 'Men', 'good', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'one', 'were', 'not', 'redolent', 'so', 'many', 'likeminded', 'movies', 'have', 'come']",N/A
646895,AAS7VH7K9XSYZ,B00005JP9X,"Ronald Steury ""Doc Ron""","[2, 3]","I saw this film when it first came out and was fascinated by the dramatic theme behind the action. But now, having just finished reading the critically praised and popular P. D. James book on which was the movie was based, I realize this movie could have said so much more. To say that the book and movie are different is a huge understatement. The movie takes the central idea of the novel (a world where a child has not been conceived in 20 years and humankind is facing extinction) and then fashions a grim, overtly violent film that appears to be juiced to appeal to teenage/20's males. Only a couple of the scenes that occur in the movie are in the book and even those are dramatically changed. Sadly, almost all of the interplay between Xan, the Warden of England, and Theo, our protagonist, are absent from the film, making Xan's presence in the film inexplicable. Likewise, the themes change from remaining hopeful when all hope is gone and the examination of one of the oldest questions man asks (Is there a God and why does He/She allow this to happen?) to a much less interesting polemic about how we treat refugees (surprise -- badly) and the argument that most of mankind will become ruthless when forced to struggle for survival (another big surprise).I think it is a shame that the spiritual undertones of the very entertaining book could not have survived the necessary simplification that comes from porting the written text to the movie's script.

I really enjoyed it, but I'm not sure that the message I got from it was the one necessarily intended, (indeed if any specific message was intended).  For what it's worth here is what I came away with:  There is a scene in an abandoned school that is falling apart and one of the characters makes the observation how its' very odd what happens in the world without children's voices.  It is in fact odd and horrific; governments have collapsed and anarchy reigns.  It appears that the only hope for humanity may be the baby being carried by a young African woman.  Michael Caine's character makes the statement that her baby is the ""miracle"" that the whole world has been waiting for.  The messianic tones are unmistakable.  This is further driven home when having had her baby the young mother carries her child outside and there is a cessation of hostilities between the warring factions.  I'm not sure that Mr. Cuaron, (the director), had a specific message, but I know that it seemed to me that at least on one level the film suggests that there is a sanctity and something sacred about life that perhaps we, (especially in the West), should wake-up to.

The documentary puts this world at this level of despair thanks to man's neglect to recognize ""global warming"".  The film was almost miserable to watch but I'm glad that I saw it.  I see it as a plausible warning about our future destination rather than just to be entertained.  The camera work was really good.  Almost like how Stanley Kubrick put a greater emphasis to a scene.  People walking towards or away from the camera as the cameraman follows the person so you would see that person's horrific surroundings as he passes through it.  Visual destruction was everywhere.  So this film was definitely visually stunning.I never thought that I would ever see and hear the classic song ""In the Court of the Crimson King"" put to a movie.  What shocked me was when that song came on,  I thought that my CD player just kicked on for no reason because I did, in fact, have King Crimson's CD in my CD player at that time.And did anyone else notice one scene at the window where you saw a balloon of a ""pig"", and the old pollution spewing chimneys of that classic old factory that was used on the ""Animals"" album from Pink Floyd?  Perhaps this is one clue put in about ""global warming"".  I wonder if there are other unique references to our past that is used here in a future about 20 years from now.  The music in this film was all just a bunch of music from their past.  I wonder if that was meant to say that all the musicians of the world are already succumbed to extinction so the only music that's known and heard is all so old.

It is mostly for film buffs/sci fi fans and arty types.The premise is fascinating...women are now infertile and the human race is dying out. The world has gone down the crapper. Immigrants are now subjected to concentration camps and are considered lower than low. There is a discovery of a pregnant immigrant and her baby will be the subject of some type of multiple illicit political ploys.Clive Owen is a real cool actor. He is no action hero yet he is a man's man. He is not loud and brash yet he radiates charisma. His acting talent was effectively demonstrated in the terrific drama ""Closer"".There are two action sequences that are quite harrowing. One involves an unexpected ambush in a car and the other is Clive Owen chasing/looking for a baby while an apartment building is in the midst of a military attack. Both scenes involve (I believe) just one camera take (a la ""Saving Private Ryan's"" opening beach battle scene) so you know the battle does not take place on a sound stage but rather it is laid out in a more elaborate manner. The long takes makes it look like it is really taking place, like it is a documentary.An issue with the movie is the lack of narrative. I guess, the viewer catches wind of what is going on while Clive Owen's charactor does but the effect makes the movie slow at times. It is hard to understand the depth of any of the charactors because of this type of story telling. Charactors come and go (like... die off) and the movie really does not deal with it.Lastly, (I am not giving away anything), the ending is abrubt and very unfullfilling. The movie starts out slow. builds up steam, captures your passion and then has a very weak ending. That may not be the film's fault since the movie is adapted from a novel. Whatever it was, I thought the movie was anticlimactic.Now, I give this movie a big thumbs up because it was great science fiction. It was no lasers/robots/spaceships sci fi but, rather, a plausible plot occuring in the not so distant future.

646911,A1GSTCPM8NRZRV,B00005JP9X,Sebastien Pharand,"[4, 6]","Children of Men is, in a way, a sci-fi movie. It takes place in the near future. The world is falling apart. War has become part of every day life. It is also a dystopian view of the one thing we take for granted; our future. But the thing Children Of Men does best is to take the convention of the sci-fi movie to humanize them in a way that is very original and affecting.Fifty years from now, the world as we know it is coming to an end. Women have been unable to have children. The world's youngest person is 18 years old. The world is self-destructing. Only England seems to be standing tall and strong (if you can call it that as the country is plagued with war and terrorism).Theo is an ordinary man who used to be an activist at one point. Soon enough, he is thrown back into his old world in order to protect a young illegal imigrant who just happens to be pregnant. As different groups want to have the girl's baby, Theo has to protect the mother, protect the child and try to decide what to do next. If the baby falls into the wrong hands, then the world will be doomed forever.Add to this many quirky characters (played by the likes of Michael Caine and Julianne Moore) and you end up with a very entertaining, very disorienting and very disappointing view of the future. Owen is incredible here as a man who is trapped between his past and his own devils. He cares for himself and himself alone. So when he has to try and take care of a girl he doesn't know, he quickly has to decided whether or not his life is more important than the baby's.But the real reason to see this film is for its cinematography. Lushly photographed, this film is an example of cinematographic genius. It doesn't present the future as being the world of Star Wars or Star Trek. What we see is eerily similar to what we do see outside our window today. The future is grim and real.  There are also two amazing long shots in this film that will leave you breathless and hungry for more.Children of Men is full of surprises. No one is safe in this film. And soon enough, the viewer starts feeling the very same way.

646912,A2TCHXH4SIN2OF,B00005JP9X,"Severian ""Severian""","[3, 5]","***SPOILERS AHEAD!!!***Cuaron's bleak dystopic vision is an excellent film, full of good acting, striking imagery, and sheer technical mastery of the film medium. The production design and numerous spectacular long takes will amaze viewers even over numerous viewings. The take on the basic plotline of the novel by P.D. James has been considerably revamped from her book, and the resulting movie though probably a better piece of cinema than a more faithful adaptation of the book would have been, will nevertheless be mainly unrecognizable to fans of the novel. The revised focus and treatment may also strike some viewers as being both overtly politicized and also perhaps overly topical, which means this film may not have the long term viability of say ""Blade Runner"" as a view of the future imperfect, but it is still a great ride in the short term.James' novel speculating on the end of human fertility and the resulting societal disorder was a somber talky meditation on Christian eschatology. The Jamesian society portrayed grappled for meaning but in a way that clearly showed what you believed in determined how you would live in such a grim scenario. The movie has far less concern with Christianity as a world view and so assumes that society would rapidly fall into hellish disrepair with surviving governments rapidly becoming fascist xenophobic police states. This latter position both allows for more obvious cinematic application and also reflects a far more widespread body of secular belief as to the untrustworthiness of government and a generally bleak view of human nature. To Cuaron, humans are both sheep who need to be led and also dumb herd animals who make generally bad choices as to which brutal and manipulative shepherds will lead them.We are barraged with police state imagery. Riot troops wait at bus stops, immigrants are herded into brutal detainment camps and treated harshly by mainly Caucasian police and soldiers, and civil liberties have been completely discarded in order to secure the shaky peace and limited prosperity of the legitimate citizens of the state. We see detainees made to wear hoods and menaced with dogs in a virtual iconographic rehash of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal of yesteryear. This is the topical element of the film, and also the aspect that may make ""Children of Men"" seem a bit dated 20 years from now, if (as we should hope!) such images are no longer a part of our popular media and culture. ""Brazil"" for instance, another police state dystopia film, has aged very well primarily because Gilliam chose to avoid over-utilization of contemporary images and instead aimed for something both timeless and surreal. Cuaron's grittier presentation has more immediate impact, but may have audiences at retro film fests in 2037 scratching their heads...The anti-immigrant fascist state pictured here may also strike some as a typical leftist Hollywood style diatribe. It may very well be that, but we must also look more deeply at the underlying ideology of the setting. We hear only hints and pieces of the world's backstory here, but we do learn that both Manhattan and Madrid have been destroyed by terrorist nukes. We know there are various bombings occurring throughout England on a daily basis (and though some characters say the government is doing this, we the audience have no idea if that is true). We also hear about the collapse of many other nation states including the U.S.Given this global background of chaos and despair, and the relative order and prosperity of England in this scenario, it is not exactly the height of Marxist paranoia to posit that the UK government might behave aggressively to defend what its citizens do have, even to the point of emphasizing security at the expense of liberty. Many people and governments throughout all ages have done exactly that, so Cuaron's portrayal of this society should not necessarily be read as an indictment of current social and political trends, but rather as an unsympathetic meditation as to where those trends might lead given a huge societal disturbance, i.e. the end of women bearing children. And this concept of future society is in the end based on that unsympathetic rendering of human nature that is at the heart of most secular beliefs on both the political right and the left - mainly that people respond to stimuli by doing what is convenient, profitable, and most secure for them, no matter what impact those decisions have on others or the world at large.It should also be pointed out that the main baddies here are NOT the ""fascist government"" which is at some level responding to both the wishes of the public and an objectively terrible and hopeless set of circumstances. The main villains instead are the Fish, the revolutionary group that wants to overthrow the government, and that is content to murder both its own members and innocents, deceive sympathetic supporters, and put a pregnant woman and her precious child at risk in order to play politics with what may be the sole possible means of continuing the human race in order to serve their own selfish agenda. The leftist revolutionaries are the ones who murder Julian, Jasper the hippie character (who kills his wife and dog because he suspects the Fish would torture them), the refugee who tries to help lead Kee and Theo to the boat, and ultimately Theo himself. In the best Orwellian tradition then, the bad guys are not only the government, but also those who supposedly are fighting against the monsters who have themselves become monsters.Therefore I do not find Cuaron's artistic voice to be neither tiresomely polemical nor blatantly unrealistic. We have here instead a fine speculative scenario, crafted with a naturalistic focus, and not one that strikes me as being impossible. The path to goodness and virtue here, in Cuaron's apparently Christless world, is altruism and dedication to others, and Clive Owen's character arc shows that clearly, as does Jasper and the various other characters who assist Kee and her child on their pilgrimage.Although I may personally wish that the Christian theme of James' novel was more overtly developed in Cuaron's film, I have no objection to his alternate choice of theme and development. My one criticism is the ending, which at the same time creates a deus ex machina, raises a whole bunch of common sense issues (why are there boats in a prison camp next to the ocean and no maritime patrols off the coast?), and also shows Cuaron's leftist sympathies to be capable of overpowering the script a bit.  Mainly, his willingness to showcase some mysterious international cartel of Wise Scientists as the only ones capable of doing what is right for the world.By the end of the film, we know little about the Human Project, are not quite sure what they will do with Kee and her baby, and we have no real idea as to why Theo is willing to trust them to the extent of sacrificing everything he values in order to put Kee and her baby in their hands. Their beautiful high tech white boat with the snazzy optimistic name seems maybe a bit too much of an end of movie effort to lighten things up a tad, and as anyone who is familiar with the UN can tell you, internationalism is not necessarily the best solution to complex problems!.Overall though this is a smart, beautiful, eloquent and touching film. Cinematography is stunning, the picture and sound of the DVD are striking, and the acting is uniformly excellent. You can watch this over and over again, and find plenty of good stuff that you missed the first few times. The DVD extras are a tad scanty, and the feature ""Possibility of Hope"" which features various intellectuals with unintelligible accents ramble on about the evils of globalism and pollution is a tad too preachy and actually raised new doubts in my mind about whether this really was just Seattle anarchy in cinematic form. The ""experts"" quoted make Noam Chomsky seem fair and balanced, and most of the ""evils"" of which they speak are not even directly relevant to the film. This is a witless unbalanced propaganda piece that undermines the intelligent nuances of the film. But then you don't have to watch it...Ultimately though ignore what Cuaron and his evidently favored coterie of academic lefties have to say about the movie, and just look at the movie itself - I am sure you will enjoy it more if you don't worry so much about politics and can better appreciate how well it functions as a piece of art on many levels.",4,"Watch the Movie, Forget the Politics, Don't

646913,A13UAIE3K517CQ,B00005JP9X,sft,"[2, 4]","This movie is extremely successful in some respects but fails in others. As a near-future thriller this is one of the best films I've seen in years. The acting is excellent throughout, the production design top-notch, and the filming style is extremely effective, especially when dealing with the very visceral set pieces. The viewer is truly thrown into the thick of the action by the use of close-up handheld camerawork and very realistic pyrotechnics. The immediacy of the fighting in the penultimate scene is quite astonishing. Sadly it's the huge holes in the logic of the film that give it a hollow ring. The basic premiss; an entirely infertile population, is fine in itself, but it's actually the barbaric, and completely unexplained, treatment of foreign refugees that is the real driving force behind the story.

It could have occurred because of pollution, gamma rays, radiation or some unknown factor.  Scientists don't know but the end result is that the last child was born on earth 18 years ago.Set in dreary England, besieged by civil unrest and a totalitarian state, Children of Men stars Clive Owens as a disillusioned revolutionary who sees no future for himself or his fractured family.  His ex-wife is played by Julianne Moore and Michael Caine gives a strong performance as an eccentric hippie type who lives in a cabin in a remote area with his catatonic wife.Enter the modern-day Virgin Mary -- she's black and part of an ethnic minority that is reviled.  The chase is on as the Clive Owen dude risks everything in order to save the life of the unborn child and its host.The concept of this movie was terrific, acting was good and filming was marvelous.  However, character development was weak and there were many unanswered questions in terms of plot, along with an unnecessarily long and predictable ending.Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.  The idea that we might become infertile is not so improbable; we already have declining population rates in North America, Europe and Russia, not because we can't reproduce but because many people are choosing not to, which is also scary!

Well the notion that Cuar&oacute;n was holding back in his Potter directorial was confirmed in my mind after seeing Children of Men.Cuar&oacute;n can indeed make a great movie and could have made Azkaban great...but it was just good. Greatness clearly shines through when Cuar&oacute;n is turned loose with ""his own"" film, and Children of Men is a good example.Children of Men is full of social and political themes as well as an abundance of messages of faith. And this is apparently what Cuar&oacute;n does best (see 2001 directorial of Oscar nominated Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n).In Children of Men almost 20 years have passed since the last human baby was born. The result? Chaos. Clearly the end of the World is near. Zombies might as well have taken over the Earth, and it was that zombie movie (you know, the good ones, like 28 Days Later [2002] or Dawn of the Dead [2004]) desperation that I was reminded of throughout Children of Men.Cuar&oacute;n adapts P.D. James' 1992 novel to the big screen with several liberties, but keeps the message pretty much the same. The story is believably told, and the movie keeps an exciting pace all the way through.Clive Owen leads the cast, and this guy just gets better and better in every film that I see him in. He's supported by Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and a bunch of other actors that all turn in A-list performances.A fair amount of action. Suspense.

In other words, you have to make a movie like ""Network"" where motives and consequences are laid out with crystal clarity.  In the England of 2027 as Cuaron imagines it, the reason for social breakdown, the motives of the repressive government (especially vis-a-vis immigrants),and the motives of the up-risers against the government (there seem to me a number of different groups) are never clear.  My problem is not that Cuaron has changed P. D. James's narrative -- it's that he hasn't presented a clear alternative universe.  All he has done is present a background of pretty generalized violence that is going to make it difficult to execute the escape of a young woman and a baby.  So the movie ends up being, narratively, a bit like ""Casablanca"" without the wit -- people who stand for a better future have to ""get away"" and sacrifices have to be made in getting them away.  Perhaps my sense that this is what the movie is at bottom explains my favorite scene -- one in which the good people escape in a car that has to be started by engaging the gears once it is in motion by running it down a muddy track while bad people with guns are in hot pursuit.  Will the engine catch?  I was waiting for Clive Owen to bang his head on the dashboard a la Han Solo . . . but (spoiler!) he didn't have to.The source of all the tension is that the baby in question is the first one to have been born IN THE WORLD for about seventeen years, and if she and her mother can make it into the hands of people who are studying how to kick-start fertility, then there's hope for humanity yet.  The universal angst about infertility exists in the movie to give it a mood -- everybody is gloomy or violent or both -- but the question of what that infertility might mean in relation to the tendencies in OUR culture that are projected forward into the dystopia is never really engaged.  Here, it's all just part of the doom and gloom and not effectively connected to the political situation, which itself is never clear.Bright spots? Cuaron's visual constructions are often striking, there's the car chase (if ""chase"" is the right word), and there's a cameo from Michael Caine that lights up moments in the movie's first half.  Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Chiwetel Ejiofor work hard, and it's no fault of their's that they can't bring this to life.

It's set in the future in a world that looks familiar, but it's dirtier, grittier and less safe than the world you're used to seeing.The movie is set in Britain in 2027 and Theo Faron (Owen) learns through a newscast that the world's youngest person has died at the age of 18. Doesn't that sound odd? Have you ever heard a report that sounds anything like that? It immediately alerts us to the fact that something is wrong. We find out that all humans are infertile and no child has been produced for more than 18 years.If people are no longer born, how long would it take for the world's existing population to die? What would happen to those already here, knowing that they will be among the last of their species?Theo visits his friend, Jasper (Michael Caine), who hides away in a house in the woods. Illegal immigrants are everywhere and government messages urge people to report them. Theo is abducted early in the story by Julian (Moore) who is his former lover. Movement within the country is restricted and she wants Theo to obtain transfer papers so that her group can take a young woman, Kee, to the coast and safety.It's a brutal existence and Theo eventually finds himself as Kee's only hope. She's one of the most important people on the planet, but only a small group of people know why. Theo guards her to the best of his ability and attempts to get her to safety using a contact of Jasper's to help them. He accepts help whenever it's offered.Some of the street scenes would be more at home in a war movie. It seems that the military regularly clashes with civilians and every group has an agenda. It's a crazy existence where law and order is virtually non-existent, and it would be frightening to experience. Do the people have any goals at all that don't involve killing and stealing what they can from others? The military prefers to shoot first and ask questions later.It impresses me that even though the world is a chaotic place and full of danger, the plot remains coherent. The audience is never in doubt about Theo's intentions; just his ability to succeed. The resolution won't make everyone happy. It's not clear what will happen in the future. This is a snapshot showing one key event in a seemingly hopeless situation. When it's all over, we are left with hope, and that's enough.Video Quality 4.5/5Although the setting is grimy, the presentation is clean and detailed. The desolate world is often presented in shades of gray, but that's no fault of the transfer. Blacks are clearly defined and colors are accurate. Scenes shot in the forest look vivid and full of detail. I didn't detect any noise or print damage and the overall look is very pleasing.Audio Quality 4/5There aren't many scenes in which the action dominates, but the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix rises to the occasion when it has to. An early explosion is startling, while the sound of bullets zipping past in the final act is effective. The mix is a little front-heavy, but everything works and it sounds effective. There are quite a few songs included in the mix and that's where the presentation really shines.Special Features 3/5The additional features all appear in standard definition:Deleted Scenes (2:22) - Three additional scenes that add very little to the story.The Possibility of Hope (27:16) - Philosophers talking about the future and what will happen if we pursue our present course.Children of Men Comments by Slavoj Zizek (5:44) - Explaining the background scenes and themes in greater depth.Under Attack (7:36) - Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n and some of the cast and crew talk about how one of the best action scenes was shot using a single take.Theo & Julian (4:40) - Owen and Moore talk about their characters. Julian was the reason Theo got involved and we learn how he's considered an ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances.Futuristic Design (8:38) - Describing the differences between the decay of existing infrastructure and new technology such as car styles.Visual Effects: Creating the Baby (3:06) - Deconstructing a scene to show how special effects are used.U ControlBD-LiveAlfonso Cuar&oacute;n directed arguably the best of the Harry Potter movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and he's created a thought-provoking movie. One of the things that struck me is the level of detail involved in predicting the future world without children. His world is believable and I found myself nodding at some of the details. It's a brutal place to visit, but a rewarding experience. The Blu-ray presentation is very good and fans of the movie or Clive Owen shouldn't hesitate to pick it up.Overall score 4/5",4,A disturbing view of one possible future,1309824000,"07 5,

646927,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,B00005JP9X,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[3, 10]","The dark future of Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's ""Children of Men"" is a stifling one.  Bleakness so pervades every corner of this world that the light of hope cannot help but be extinguished.Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is drawn into the web of rebel group who have an important task for him.  He is told by his ex-lover, Julian (Julianne Moore), that he must accompany a woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) out of England and deliver her to a sanctuary run by ""The Human Project.""  What makes Kee so special is that she is pregnant - a miracle in a world where the female population has become sterile.  Yet, Theo's task is far from easy as government factions and a rogue element within the rebel group want Kee for their own purposes.""Children of Men"" does have its share of positives.  It does not shy away from addressing many hot-button issues regarding immigration, assisted-suicide, and totalitarianism.  Also, the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is astonishing.  The future world he captures on film is frightening and is all the more disturbing because it could easily be seen as prophetic in light of the numerous troubles currently plaguing the real world.  Yet, the film overall is ultimately unsatisfying.  The story turns out to be uninvolving and even borders on the boring after the film's premise is established.  As it unfolds, ""Children of Men"" devolves into nothing more than a prolonged chase that tries to keep matters interesting by sneaking in some social commentary every now and then.  Cuar&oacute;n undoubtedly set out to make a film with higher aspirations but only succeed in making one with squandered potential written all over it.",2,"""You look good.

646929,ABP2UMJY61K8A,B00005JP9X,Summeroz,"[4, 6]","What it is about:Children of men is shows us a desolate future where women are unable to have children.  The despair and ruin this causes is unimaginable.  The known world is torn apart by terrorism, political rebellion, a holocaust of sorts where all refugees are treated worse than animals and sent to live in camps and shipped back to where they came from.  In this depressing dreary world we have Theo an ex activist who is pretty much just going through the motions. His ex wife a political activist enlists his help to deliver a pregnant girl to a secretive group.The good:It is a fabulously done movie.  The story and the cinematography are amazing.  Some shots are so amazing you wonder if it was a single take or how the director did it.  There is a lot of action in this movie.  The intensity is so in your face you feel like you are there.  The funny thing is this isn't supposed to be an action movie per se. but the movie is so intense and exciting you feel like it is an action movie.  The movie never lets up until the end.The supportive cast is also very good.  Michael Caine as a friend of Theo is amazingly great.  His character is funny and balances out Theo's darkly somber self.It is a very good movie with lots of meaning and really makes you think about politics, future while actually enjoying the movie.The Bad:The movie doesn't really follow the book.  It just took the premise of a chaotic world of infertility so you won't find a page by page comparison of the book and the movie.Conclusion:This is an excellent film that can be enjoyed by all.  The film is rated R for intense scenes of violence.  But the violence I feel is actually a realistic view of a world without hope.  Yes there is a message in this movie about immigration, terrorism, tolitarian government etc. the movie is still exciting within itself.

Often, when he walks the streets of London, he always comes across some sort of explosion or fight. He sees shooting and violence everywhere(pretty creepy).One day, while he is coming back from work, he is attacked and thrown into a van. He is then locked up in a room. Suddeny, Theo sees in the shadow the face of a familiar woman. It happens to be his estranged wife, Julian (Academy-Award Nominee, Julianne Moore). She apologizes for leaving him, and gives the typical excuse of ""everytime I looked at you, you reminded me of our lost child), so typial. Julian asks a favor of Theo. After meeting for a few more times he agrees, they then get into a car with a few of her friends, and as they are driving they come across another riot. Theo just thinks its just a normal riot, but its not. Suddenly, a guy on a motorbike comes and shoots Julian through the window in the neck. She is instantly killed. Theo later finds out that Julian wanted Theo to save a woman named Khee. She is pregnant. It happens to be a big deal. He takes her all through England, until she is finally safe. He goes through so many riots. Then eventually, he is shot. Jasper (Academy-Award Winner, Michael Caine), also tries to help, but he is fatally shot as well. It is such a silly movie, and it was very depressing. I didn't really like it. Julianne Moore's role is very small, and for her character to die like that, was very disheartening. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Surprisingly it seems to be very popular, and it is considered a great movie. However, I don't think it is. Clive Owen and Julianne Moore have done much better films. See Closer, Derailed for Owen. Or others like The Forgotten, or Freedomland for Moore(who has plenty of screentime in both).

I found the basic premise to be fascinating: How would the world react twenty years into an epidemic of childlessness? Which some of the reviewers here seem to miss...this is not just how the world reacts to the onset of infertility, but almost two decades since the last baby was born. So many industries would fall into slow collapse; education, garments, much of the medical industry, etc...as the population ages past the point where new folks would replenish both consumer and professional.Clive Owen starts off the movie in a coffee shop as the world learns of the death of its youngest citizen. He walks into a city full of violent rebellion and to where Britain is the last nation that hasn't fallen into anarchy. The government has slipped into a fascist state in order to keep from being overrun by refugees, yet Owen's ex-wife (Julianne Moore, great in a brief role) kidnaps him to set a plot into motion. They have discovered the last pregnant woman on Earth, an African named Kee. They need to smuggle her out of England to a mysterious ""Human Project"" group.This is where the chaos really begins and the allegories become oppressive. Kee's baby has no discernable father (and a miracle birth is even joked about). The miracle baby has factions splitting off of factions before the little savior is even born. Oh yes, the African mother; how very Cradle of Civilization! Plus one reclusive ex-hippie idealist (Michael Caine, all crazy hair, John Lennon and homegrown weed) to emphasize just how badly the sixties failed when they were all so much better then than these fascists now.The heavy handedness of the message is carried by some incredible cinematography, like the near ten minute single-camera shot of Owen racing through the prison camp uprising while under fire. London in decay is depressingly gritty as is the Fugee concentration camp (with shades of Abu Gharib). The sense of dread curdles under each character (like Owen's visit to his brother, the art curator), yet the tiny light of hope of the new baby still stops a war in its tracks, however briefly.It is that final sense of redemption - the ""maybe we might get our miserable species out of this mess anyway"" message - that keeps the relentlessly bleak view of ""Children of Men"" from completely tanking. But it's the ham-fisted proletyzing that also stops it from arcing beyond its science-fiction art-house roots.",3,Dystopian Dysfunction,1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,2589,"['Oddly', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'folks', 'have', 'seen', 'Children', 'Men', 'did', 'not', 'form', 'opinion', 'being', 'rancid', 'pile', 'rotting', 'mule', 'skin', 'greatest', 'movie', 'sinceSilent', 'Running', 'found', 'basic', 'premise', 'be', 'fascinating', 'How', 'would', 'world', 'react', 'twenty', 'years', 'epidemic', 'childlessness', 'Which', 'reviewers', 'here', 'seem', 'miss', 'not', 'just', 'how', 'world', 'onset', 'infertility', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'last', 'baby', 'was', 'born', 'So', 'many', 'industries', 'would', 'fall', 'slow', 'collapse', 'education', 'garments', 'much', 'medical', 'industry', 'etc', 'population', 'point', 'where', 'new', 'folks', 'would', 'replenish', 'consumer', 'professional.Clive', 'Owen', 'movie', 'coffee', 'shop', 'world', 'death', 'youngest', 'citizen', 'city', 'full', 'violent', 'rebellion', 'where', 'Britain', 'last', 'nation', ""n't"", 'fallen', 'anarchy', 'government', 'slipped', 'fascist', 'state', 'order', 'keep', 'being', 'overrun', 'refugees', 'Owen', 'ex-wife', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'great', 'brief', 'role', 'set', 'plot', 'motion', 'have', 'discovered', 'last', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'Earth', 'African', 'named', 'Kee', 'need', 'smuggle', 'England', 'mysterious', 'Human', 'Project', 'group.This', 'where', 'chaos', 'really', 'allegories', 'become', 'oppressive', 'Kee', 'baby', 'discernable', 'father', 'miracle', 'birth', 'even', 'joked', 'miracle', 'baby', 'factions', 'splitting', 'factions', 'little', 'savior', 'even', 'born', 'Oh', 'yes', 'African', 'mother', 'how', 'very', 'Cradle', 'Civilization', 'one', 'reclusive', 'ex-hippie', 'idealist', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'crazy', 'hair', 'John', 'Lennon', 'homegrown', 'weed', 'emphasize', 'just', 'how', 'badly', 'sixties', 'failed', 'when', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'then', 'fascists', 'now.The', 'heavy', 'handedness', 'message', 'carried', 'incredible', 'cinematography', 'near', 'ten', 'minute', 'single-camera', 'shot', 'Owen', 'racing', 'prison', 'camp', 'uprising', 'fire', 'London', 'decay', 'depressingly', 'gritty', 'Fugee', 'concentration', 'camp', 'shades', 'Abu', 'Gharib', 'sense', 'dread', 'curdles', 'character', 'Owen', 'visit', 'brother', 'art', 'curator', 'yet', 'tiny', 'light', 'hope', 'new', 'baby', 'still', 'war', 'tracks', 'however', 'briefly.It', 'final', 'sense', 'redemption', 'maybe', 'might', 'get', 'miserable', 'species', 'mess', 'anyway', 'message', 'relentlessly', 'bleak', 'view', 'Children', 'Men', 'completely', 'tanking', 'ham-fisted', 'proletyzing', 'also', 'arcing', 'science-fiction', 'art-house', 'roots']",N/A

646935,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00005JP9X,Tom Benton,"[9, 12]","Of all the cinema's many apocalypse films, never have I seen one so profoundly cynical and melancholy as Alfonso Cuaron's CHILDREN OF MEN.  Adapted from popular novelist P.D. James' one departure from her usual mysteries, the film is set in 2027, where the world is speedily falling into mass chaos.  Humankind can no longer reproduce, and as the lead character, Theo (Clive Owen), remarks, ""All of this [humanity] will be gone in seventy years.""  The one society that remains relatively kempt is Britain, where Theo attempts to evade the frequent terrorist attacks and assaults from savage bands of the homeless.  One day Theo is reunited with his old flame, Julian (Julianne Moore), now the leader of a terrorist organization.  Julian needs papers to escort a young woman across the border; Theo reluctantly agrees to get the papers and escort the young woman, but finds that his role is far more important than he could ever have dreamed when he learns just what the young woman is carrying.CHILDREN OF MEN is more than likely the finest of all apocalyptic films, surpassing even such classics as MAD MAX and its sequel, MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR.  While those films had impressive-enough craftmanship to give them considerable cult appeal, they lack the artistry of CHILDREN OF MEN.  This is due completely to Cuaron and the highly-talented cast, which also includes the surprisingly menacing Chiwetel Ejiofor and the always delightful Michael Caine as a gas-passing, pot-smoking Lennon-esque character.  Cuaron made a name for himself with the erotic Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN and the magical HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, but CHILDREN OF MEN is unarguably his masterpiece.Cuaron succeeds wonderfully in the dramatic sense, inspiring absolutely top-notch performances from all the actors.  Owen, as usual, is simply marvelous.  As the film begins, he's unquestionably the antihero, but by the film's end he has become a hero in the most sincere form of the word.  Moore is typically impressive, but her role is almost painfully short.  It's Caine who steals the show, as he has done in every film he's appeared in over the last four years or so.  His ridiculously aloof, rude, yet oddly charming performance provides some much-needed comic relief amidst a stupefying amount of bleakness.However, Cuaron is even more of a success in his role as a sci-fi director.  All too often an interesting concept is wasted on a pretentious filmmaker who uses big names and bombastic explosions to attract audiences.  Cuaron doesn't strive for greatness; it comes naturally through the effort he puts into his films and the amount of sheer talent he has.  In CHILDREN OF MEN, he fashions enough of a science-fiction film to make the audience think, enough of a drama to get the audience emotionally-involved, and enough of a thriller to make the audience panic.  It's how surprisingly down-to-earth the film is that makes it all seem so terrifyingly real.Undoubtedly, the most horrible aspect of CHILDREN OF MEN is its depiction of the near future.  This vision of 2027 isn't far-fetched at all - in fact, most of the film's scares come from how chillingly similar 2027 is to 2007.  It's a believable future, where newspaper clippings protesting the Iraq War still remain, the designs of cars have changed very slightly, and rock band Radiohead has finally received the credit it deserves.  The suddenty of humankind's infertility, and the speed at which humanity descends into sheer madness, is enough to keep anyone awake long nights dreading the seeming inevitability of so black a future.What keeps the audience from drowning under CHILDREN OF MEN's tidal wave of futility is hope, a white light that becomes progressively brighter as the film pushes on.  Hope that things are not as bad as they may seem, hope that things will get better, hope that we aren't helpless at the world's end.  But as strong as this hope may be, and even though the film does end on a relatively happy note, it's the fear that things will not get better and that we are helpless that will leave theatergoers trembling and pondering direly far beyond the end credits.",5,Hope survives amidst bleakness and futility in Alfonso Cuaron's stupefying masterpiece,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,4147,"['cinema', 'many', 'apocalypse', 'films', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'so', 'profoundly', 'cynical', 'melancholy', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'CHILDREN', 'MEN', 'Adapted', 'popular', 'novelist', 'P.D', 'James', 'one', 'departure', 'usual', 'mysteries', 'film', 'set', '2027', 'where', 'world', 'speedily', 'falling', 'mass', 'chaos', 'Humankind', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'reproduce', 'lead', 'character', 'Theo', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'remarks', '[', 'humanity', ']', 'will', 'be', 'gone', 'seventy', 'years', 'one', 'society', 'relatively', 'kempt', 'Britain', 'where', 'Theo', 'evade', 'frequent', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'assaults', 'savage', 'bands', 'homeless', 'One', 'day', 'Theo', 'reunited', 'old', 'flame', 'Julian', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'now', 'leader', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'Julian', 'papers', 'escort', 'young', 'woman', 'border', 'Theo', 'reluctantly', 'get', 'papers', 'escort', 'young', 'woman', 'role', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'dreamed', 'when', 'just', 'what', 'young', 'woman', 'carrying.CHILDREN', 'MEN', 'more', 'likely', 'finest', 'apocalyptic', 'films', 'surpassing', 'even', 'such', 'classics', 'MAD', 'MAX', 'sequel', 'MAD', 'MAX', '2', 'ROAD', 'WARRIOR', 'films', 'had', 'impressive-enough', 'craftmanship', 'give', 'considerable', 'cult', 'appeal', 'lack', 'artistry', 'CHILDREN', 'OF', 'MEN', 'due', 'completely', 'Cuaron', 'highly-talented', 'cast', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'menacing', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'always', 'delightful', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'gas-passing', 'pot-smoking', 'Lennon-esque', 'character', 'Cuaron', 'made', 'name', 'erotic', 'Y', 'TU', 'MAMA', 'TAMBIEN', 'magical', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'AND', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'OF', 'AZKABAN', 'CHILDREN', 'OF', 'MEN', 'unarguably', 'masterpiece.Cuaron', 'wonderfully', 'dramatic', 'sense', 'inspiring', 'absolutely', 'top-notch', 'performances', 'actors', 'Owen', 'usual', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'film', 'unquestionably', 'antihero', 'film', 'end', 'become', 'hero', 'most', 'sincere', 'form', 'word', 'Moore', 'typically', 'impressive', 'role', 'almost', 'painfully', 'short', 'Caine', 'who', 'show', 'done', 'film', 'appeared', 'last', 'four', 'years', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'aloof', 'rude', 'yet', 'oddly', 'charming', 'performance', 'much-needed', 'comic', 'relief', 'stupefying', 'amount', 'bleakness.However', 'Cuaron', 'even', 'more', 'success', 'role', 'sci-fi', 'director', 'All', 'too', 'often', 'interesting', 'concept', 'wasted', 'pretentious', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'big', 'names', 'bombastic', 'explosions', 'attract', 'audiences', 'Cuaron', ""n't"", 'strive', 'greatness', 'naturally', 'effort', 'films', 'amount', 'sheer', 'talent', 'CHILDREN', 'OF', 'MEN', 'enough', 'science-fiction', 'film', 'make', 'audience', 'think', 'enough', 'drama', 'get', 'audience', 'emotionally-involved', 'enough', 'thriller', 'make', 'audience', 'panic', 'how', 'surprisingly', 'down-to-earth', 'film', 'seem', 'so', 'terrifyingly', 'real.Undoubtedly', 'most', 'horrible', 'aspect', 'CHILDREN', 'OF', 'MEN', 'depiction', 'near', 'future', 'vision', '2027', ""n't"", 'far-fetched', 'fact', 'most', 'film', 'scares', 'come', 'how', 'chillingly', 'similar', '2027', '2007', 'believable', 'future', 'where', 'newspaper', 'protesting', 'Iraq', 'War', 'still', 'remain', 'designs', 'cars', 'have', 'changed', 'very', 'slightly', 'rock', 'band', 'Radiohead', 'finally', 'received', 'credit', 'suddenty', 'humankind', 'infertility', 'speed', 'humanity', 'sheer', 'madness', 'enough', 'keep', 'anyone', 'awake', 'long', 'nights', 'dreading', 'seeming', 'inevitability', 'so', 'black', 'audience', 'drowning', 'CHILDREN', 'OF', 'MEN', 'tidal', 'wave', 'futility', 'hope', 'white', 'light', 'progressively', 'brighter', 'film', 'pushes', 'Hope', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'may', 'seem', 'hope', 'things', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'hope', 'are', ""n't"", 'helpless', 'world', 'end', 'as', 'strong', 'hope', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'film', 'end', 'relatively', 'happy', 'note', 'fear', 'things', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'are', 'helpless', 'will', 'leave', 'theatergoers', 'trembling', 'pondering', 'direly', 'far', 'end', 'credits']",N/A

646938,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JP9X,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Based on P. D. James' novel of the same title, Alfonso Cuaron made a futuristic action/thriller, which opens with a strange news report about a shocking death of 'the world's youngest man.' The film is set in England, now chaotic country in the year of 2027. No child has been born for 18 years in the world and the country witnessed the widening gap between those who have and those who do not. Humans are going to be extinct very slowly.[STORY] Clive Own plays a quiet businessman Theodore, a former activist whose ex-lover (and now the leader of anti-government group called FISH) Julian (Julianne Moore) suddenly shows up before him and asks him to do an impossible thing for her. She says her organization needs a government's pass to secretly transport a woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) out of England, who is, she believes, the only hope to save the world from destruction.[ACTORS] Though Julianne Moore is second-billed, and her character plays an important role in the story, hers is actually an extended cameo. Michael Caine effectively plays an ex-hippie Jasper (with a long hair which might look a bit strange) who gives a help to Theo, and there are supporting actors like Chiwetel Ejiofor, Charlie Hunnam, Danny Huston and Peter Mullan, but the film basically belongs to two actors Clive Owen and Claire-Hope Ashitey.[VISUALLY STUNNING] You should not miss two long continuous shots, one of which goes on more than 10 minutes. Besides these technical things, Alfonso Cuaron, with Emmanuel Lubezki very realistic photography, succeeds in creating a bleak view of the world that reminds us of recent news footages from Iraq. The director refuses to use his trademark green color here. Instead he uses grey-colored images that captures the brooding atmosphere of the future with no hope. And don't forget this; the film is sometimes violent, showing spluttered blood on the lense.Clive Owen is very good as reluctant hero and so are other actors, whose acting almost makes up for the film's flawed script. Though I have not read the original book, Alfonso Cuaron clearly changed it to make the film's theme more immediate. That is fine, but still the plot suffers from some incredible coincidences (which I cannot reveal here) and some gaps in logics. To me Cuaron's vision about the strife-torn land of England, where refugees are treated in the places that look like concentration camps, are convincing only visually -- why do people rush to England when Theo and Kee must leave? Is there a better place outside there? These and other details remain hazy.Though the film is set in the near future, it is clearly about our time. The film is visually stunning, especially during the battles (don't miss the driving scene) and you also get the original music by John Tavener, but the more detailed logics in plot would have made it a better film.

646939,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JP9X,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","CHILDREN OF MEN is a deep, dark, dreary, and dynamic film that offers the possibility of hope in a dystopian future.  It is a moving and thought-provoking film, full of social commentary and could very well be Alfonso Cuaron's best movie, yet.The movie takes place in Britain in the year 2027.  The film opens with Theo Faron (Clive Owen) purchasing coffee at a local shop as the television broadcasts the death of the world's youngest person: an 18-year-old boy named Baby Diego (Jaun Gabriel Yacuzzi).  For eighteen years women have been unable to bear any children.  The government sponsors all sorts of activities to promote sex and promiscuity, but it has been to no avail.  As Theo leaves the coffee shop and walks down the trash-filled streets, a bomb goes off destroying the very shop Theo had just left moments before.Needing a break Theo takes the day off work and takes the train to visit his friend Jasper Palmer (Michael Caine), passing caged illegal immigrants along the way.  Jasper was an award-winning political cartoonist married to an award-winning journalist.  However, when the chaos began his wife was captured by the government and returned as a vegetable.  Jasper cheers Theo up and offers him a perspective about the whole thing.  The next day things seem ""normal"" but as Theo is on is way to work he is kidnapped by the terrorist group FISH.  He soon learns that the group is being led by his wife, Julian (Julianne Moore).  The group wants to transport a young refugee to the coast so she can be picked up by a ship.  The girl, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), needs papers and Theo has connections.  However, Theo is also one of the only people that Julian trusts left in the world.  Theo is able to get the papers, but he has to escort Kee.  Along the way the group is attacked and has to take refuge.  Theo learns that Kee is pregnant and that Julian had very serious reasons for only trusting Theo.  Knowing that the hope of the world lies with Kee he sets out to escort her to the coast where she can meet the Human Project, a secret organization that has supposedly a safe haven and is working on a cure for the human infertility problem.The acting of CHILDREN OF MEN is top-notch.  I've only seen a handful of film Clive Owen has acted in and I've enjoyed them all.  He is a classy actor and one whose star will continue to rise.  I really like Julianne Moore and even though she isn't on screen for a very long time, her presence lights up every scene she is in.  Michael Caine is another actor who makes every film he's in just better by being in it and he works his magic in CHILDREN OF MEN (it's also kind of funny seeing Caine make fart jokes and rambling about weed).  Claire-Hope Ashitey is virtually a newcomer to the bigscreen and in her first major role she shines brightly.  The rest of the cast of CHILDREN OF MEN is multi-national and each actor and actress is excellent in their roles.  No one, not even the extras, seem out of place or abnormal.The cinematography in CHILDREN OF MEN is amazing.  Cuaron does some amazing things with the camera.  There are two long, one-camera shots that particular stick out to me:  the car scene was done all in one-long take with one camera and the scene where Theo is escorting Kee out of a building where the terrorists are fighting the government forces was all done in one camera in one take.  These are incredibly long shots (the car scene is almost five minutes in length) and to have them turn out so effectively with so much going on is almost unheard of.  It requires incredible direction and foresight to do such shots, let alone do them effectively.CHILDREN OF MEN is an incredibly dark film.  It's probably too dark and bleak for some people to deal with.  There is a lot of violence, but much of it occurs off screen; people are shot but we only see them falling down from a distance or they are killed off screen with only a spot of blood speckling the camera lens to illustrate what has happened.  The movie is also an incredibly deep social commentary.  Racism, illegal immigration, terrorism, national security, sanitation policies, sex education, euthanasia, media manipulation, and the importance of life are all issues that the film deals with.  Some might be mistaken to believe that the film is anti-government and pro-terrorists (or insurgents).  This isn't the case because the film clearly shows that neither the government nor the terrorists are completely right or wrong; they are fighting a circular war that won't end until one is able to wipe out the other.Despite this bleak view of the humanity and the future, CHILDREN OF MEN is a movie full of hope.  The world can be an incredible dark and dreary place, but hope remains and that changes everything, something I have been reminded of several times lately.  There are some who will not like the film's ending because it doesn't seem to bring closure.  However, in the mood and tone of the film it fits and it doesn't end in despair, but in hope.I found CHILDREN OF MEN to be an incredibly moving picture.  At times it was almost brutal to watch.  Throughout it was a fascinating and riveting piece of cinema.  There are several scenes that have stuck in my mind and I find myself dwelling on during the day.  For instance, in a short, but important scene in the film Theo is having lunch with his cousin and is trying to convince him to get him the papers he needs to escort the girl to the coast.  Sitting at the table is his cousin's son.  The boy is in his mid-twenties and though physically he might be a man, he is really a boy.  He sits at the table eating with one hand while using the other to play with an interactive electronic device attached to his fingers and head.  The boy is so absorbed in what he is doing that he has no idea what is occurring around him, he doesn't even realize that he is eating and his father has to yell at him to get him to put his fork down and take his pill.  The scene is ironic because Theo's cousin has been doing everything he can to save and restore the world's great pieces of art and culture.  Theo asks him why he does it when in thirty years none of it will matter and he replies that it doesn't matter because he doesn't think about that.  There is so much in that scene that can be taken away; so much to think about.  Theo's cousin might not think about the future, but we need to.",5,"Bleak as Things Might Get, Hope Remains.",1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,6397,"['CHILDREN', 'OF', 'MEN', 'deep', 'dark', 'dreary',

James, ""Children of Men"" takes place in a future where women suddenly become infertile. The world is tearing itself apart and the only sea of tranquility is Britain yet that tranquil sea is very much an illusion as the nation has turned into a police state where everyone must carry their passport to prove they are citizens or be shipped out to a war zone like concentration camp. Theo (Clive Owen) once an activist seems trapped in an emotional war zone of his own of apathy having never recovered from the death of his son nearly a decade before. His own emotions have become still born. When his ex-wife (Julianne Moore) the head of a radical terrorist group called The Fish asks for his help in smuggling a pregnant woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to safety, he is reluctantly drawn into her plan for the money but finds that his emotions immerge from their cocoon as well becoming the man he used to be.In a dreary year for science fiction films, ""Children of Men"" finally presents an oasis of memorable images, characters and observations. Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n wisely turned down the chance to director the sequel to his ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" to helm this project. Brilliantly directed with a marvelous, rich screenplay by Cuar&oacute;n, Timothy J. Sexton, David Arata, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby (one suspects that the bulk of the writers on these projects worked on earlier drafts that have little resemblance to the final product) the film uses the heavy handed imagery of P.D. James novel to its advantage. Clive Owen continues to prove he's a magnificent and underrated actor. He brings depth and presence to his world weary portrayal of Theo. The film features strong support performances by Danny Huston, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Caine adding a sense of gritty reality to the proceedings.The gritty look of the film is quite intentional as the director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") wanted to make the audience feel as if they were seeing a realistic look at the future. As a result the film has both the gritty feel of a documentary in terms of the film grain but also in terms of the constant camera movement throughout the film.END OF SPOILERS:While there aren't a huge amount of special features many are worthwhile. First up we get three deleted scenes that run around 2 minutes. While none of them are essential at least two amplify the desperate situation that Theo finds  himself in; one features Theo's apartment manager showing up at his door for four months past due rent while another continues Theo's meeting with his cousin who is a member of the government and collects artwork.We also get ""Children of Men Comments by philosopher Slavoj Zizek"" which most folks are going to skip. While some of his observations are interesting, they're the type of observations that you'd hear in a basic philosophy class. I suppose they are included to give legitimacy to this science fiction film but his comments aren't necessary to recognize the power of this film.""Under Attack"" highlights the long takes used throughout the film. We hear from star Owen, director Cuar&oacute;n and the producers discussing the difficulty in shooting the action sequences with these long fluid takes shot on location. Cuar&oacute;n's vision for the film required constant camera movement which doesn't allow the filmmakers to fake it as they might normally. In particular we see the sequence where Theo, his ex-wife and others attacked in the country in their car and how it was put together with physical effects allowing for a 12 minute uninterrupted take.""Theo and Julian"" allows us to hear the actors Julianne Moore and Clive Owen's thoughts on their character. Director Cuar&oacute;n also chimes in on the collaborative nature of creating a character with his actors and integrating their suggestions into an already finished script. It's clear that he relishes the collaborative nature of film and that the performers that have worked with him enjoyed the project as well.""Futuristic Design"" focuses on the production design with comments by producer Hilary Shor and how they had to straddle the line between the futuristic look of the film while also grounding it in our world. Jim Clay and Jennifer Williams the production designer and set designer respectively discuss how the natural instinct is to go for a visually strong look for a science fiction film. He suggested they fight that instinct create and use ugly environments that refer to our current world to bring home the gritty reality of the film as much as possible. Using London as their background the designers created a world that is as old and tired looking reflecting the biological sterility facing mankind but also reflects a world that is at the brink of collapse.""Visual Creating the Baby"" highlights the delivery scene in the film. Created with CGI this sequence was difficult to shoot because they couldn't use a real baby for the sequence and had to use a combination of prosthetics, CGI and physical effects to create the sequence. Small details such as Theo's breath in the freezing room where the baby is delivered were created in post-production and digitally inserted.An effective, powerful science fiction thriller, ""Children of Men"" features a number of powerful performances from Owen's world weary take on Theo to Moore's activist Julian their performances bring gravity to the situations in the film adding another level suggesting this world is just around the corner from our own.",5,Powerful film,1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,5656,"['WARNING-', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'dystopian', 'tale', 'set', '2027', 'based',

There is a disconcerting realism to it, as if this world exists right now. Rarely are there special effects or technology to amuse us. There's a little bit, but for the most part the filmmaker presents a world just like ours, only worse in tangible ways. I thought the constant hurdles and quick twists of fortune thrown up in the main characters faces were terribly realistic at the same time as they're surprising. Clive Owen is convincing as the pained, alchololic protagonist.Now, if all that sounds depressing... it is. But this film is good both because it does justice to an examination of the possibility that the future may not be brighter than the past, and because as the film progresses people do rise to the struggle in wonderful ways. The hope of continued life and longing for what children mean to the world infuses this with possibility. It's a very good film. I just read the description of the book, which seemed quite different in some ways.

All of the camera angels are from the point of view of someone near the person being filmed. There aren't any spiraling, omnipotent camera angles.

The child, in particular, is hers. It's also the first human baby born in nearly twenty years, since some unstated catastrophe ended every human pregnancy - and stopped every other pregnancy since, except hers. She's so young that she never even saw a baby, except in pictures, and now she has one. The only one.But the world around her has gone to hell, or maybe become a hell. ""After the fall"" movies have been around for a long time: Soylent Green, Hurt's 1984, Bladerunner, and many others, always fallen just a bit farther than the one before. Now we have Children of Men. Skies are stained with smoke, streets are littered since no one cares, and the government ration boxes include suicide kits - the ones advertised on subsidized TV. It's just too believable.I can't say there's a real plot to this movie. It's a small kind of quest, maybe just a trek through concentration camps, buildings burning in urban combat, and scorched earth. Michael Caine puts in a superb performance, since he doesn't know how to do anything else. This time, he's an aging hippie, but also a very brave and pacifist combatant in that war that seems to have no reason, and something even braver for his wife. Claire-Hope Ashitey, an emerging star, plays the young mother (or new Eve) with quiet beauty and charm. The rest of the movie doesn't conspicuously manipulate our feelings until the end, but we want it by then.I'm still not quite sure what to make of this movie, or even whether I want to see it again.

From the very beginning we are thrown into a decaying, depressed world. We learn quickly that the human race has become entirely incapable of reproducing. Although the causes are unknown for the most part, there is much speculation throughout and conspiracy theorizing.The film covers all aspects of the human condition and currently relevant topics as well. Immigration, discrimination, loneliness, depression, hopelessness, government control, media spin: all of these topics are given ample consideration.The future that Alfonso Cuaron paints here is bleak and depressing. But visually, the film is stunning. Several shots last for several minutes and cover unbelievable amounts of distance and action. At times it's hard to imagine that the camera has been rolling continuously while buildings explode and people are mowed down by machine gun fire. This helps give the movie a sense of reality that only deepens the darkness of what we see.All the acting is phenomenal, and Clive Owen makes a great anti-hero, as a normal guy trying to navigate the perils of terrorist groups and governmental control.The special features are great and include a documentary about what the film represents and a look into what we are doing to our planet through pollution and our treatment of our fellow humans.
