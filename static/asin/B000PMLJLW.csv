I'm so glad I did. All the great memories of that time came back watching these. Sure the history isn't accurate, some cheap sets are used & some so-so acting is involved. But, Scott Forbes is such a likeable actor & I love the era & even the Ken Darby Singers ""Ooooing"" away in the background. This was a huge show among my childhood peers & I just can't help liking it. Some shows I don't care about cost or quality, I'm just grateful to have them in any condition. The quality of these DVD's are excellent. If you want good old American 1950's TV history, check out Jim Bowie. I sure wish they would release ""Yancy Derringer"", ""The Rebel"" & ""The Grey Ghost"" on DVD.",5,A Favorite of a kid from this era of the 1950's.,1239753600,"04 15, 2009",2009,808,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'should', 'purchase', 'whole', 'series', 'Jim', 'Bowie', 'had', 'episodes', 'VHS', 'always', 'liked', 'decided', 'splurge', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'great', 'memories', 'time', 'came', 'back', 'watching', 'Sure', 'history', ""n't"", 'accurate', 'cheap', 'sets', 'are', 'used', 'so-so', 'acting', 'involved', 'Scott', 'Forbes', 'such', 'likeable', 'actor', 'love', 'era', 'even', 'Ken', 'Darby', 'Singers', 'Ooooing', 'away', 'background', 'was', 'huge', 'show', 'childhood', 'peers', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'cost', 'quality', ""'m"", 'just', 'grateful', 'have', 'condition', 'quality', 'DVD', 'are', 'excellent', 'want', 'good', 'old', 'American', '1950', 'TV', 'history', 'check', 'out', 'Jim', 'Bowie', 'sure', 'wish', 'would', 'release', 'Yancy', 'Derringer', 'Rebel', 'Grey', 'Ghost', 'DVD']",Jim Bowie Complete Collection
1072637,A91BK8S5QH98K,B000PMLJLW,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[4, 4]","This is a television series that knows no rival.  It is based on a novel by Monte Barrett titled the ""Tempered Blade"", a fact mixed with fiction account of the life of Jim Bowie.  Jim Bowie being the famous frontiersman who is most remembered for inventing the famous ""Bowie Knife.""  However, as both the novel and the series reveal, it turns out Bowie was quite an innovator and intelligent man.  Set primarily in 1830s Louisiana, this black and white series is replete with historical and charming vignettes concerning the life of Jim Bowie.  One learns how many of the streets in New Orleans were named, the origin of the word cocktail, details about how some Cajuns didn't want to believe the Louisiana Purchase had been made, and how the famous bird painter Audubon was once thought to be of royal ancestry.  The series is a clean one and actually appropriate for family viewing.  At the time of its initial airing in the fifties it was thought to be a little too violent for the young, but nowadays the fight scenes just seem clever.  Jim Bowie himself is portrayed by Scott Forbes, who lends the role a rare yet most appealing air of raw masculinity mixed with cultured sophistication.  For classic television buffs it is also interesting to see different actors in their early roles, such as Sam Houston being portrayed by the same actor who would later be Uncle Jesse on ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" series.  This DVD collection of ""The Adventures of Jim Bowie"" is especially exceptional because it is the complete series and features good sound quality.  Simply put, this show is one of the best ever produced and it is well worth the time and money.

This DVD contains the entire run of the series whose target audience was probably pre-teen boys.  Today it is fun just to see the incredible historical liberties taken by the writers.Scott Forbes (a British actor who had found a home in American television's many dramatic anthology series) plays the title character.  Bowie and his brother Rezin (Peter Hanson) had invented the ""Bowie Knife"" and the opening credits begin with a knife being thrown into a wooden door.  Then begins the theme song by the King's Men Quartet (not to be confused with the pop group that gave us ""Louie Louie"" a few years later).Based on a novel ""The Tempered Blade"" by Monte Barrett, the series is set in the Louisiana-Texas region during the 1830's and the many episodes have Jim interacting with historical figures from the period like Andrew Jackson, John James Audubon, and Jean Lafitte the Pirate.  If you were a young boy back in 1957 you could have mistakenly formed the impression that Lafitte was a central figure in American history, as it was his gold doubloons that the Hardy Boys were after on the ""Mickey Mouse Club's serial: ""Applegate's Treasure"".Then again, what do I know?
