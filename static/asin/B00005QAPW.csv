It's a movie about summer worth viewing all year round.It is about what every good summer vacation is about:  Everything and anything, but nothing specific.  Just seeking to have as much fun as possible.  Play, lust, love,... whatever.  Maybe one or two things that later seem a bit reckless?  Why not?  So throw yourself into this film with the same reckless abandon, and just let it take you wherever it takes you.  And don't worry, whatever these two guys do won't go on their permanent records!Everyone can find some connection to this flick, whatever their age or sexuality.  It's about a carefree time of life that seems almost too long while it lasts, and ever so fleeting and lost once it's gone away.  A time when we are content to simply see how things play out and live them without undue concern for the outcomes nor any serious consequences for missteps along the way.For teens, it's what every summer promises to be.  For those is their twenties, it's what summers used to be just a short time ago.  For everyone else, it's a salient recollection of what summers used to be, long ago.Other good movies in this genre:  ""Come Undone""  which I've reviewed on Amazon, and that review cites yet another good title.",4,Just like summer it's ends all too soon,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,1317,"['end', 'movie', 'just', 'summer', ""'ll"", 'find', 'hate', 'see', 'go', 'away', 'movie', 'summer', 'viewing', 'year', 'round.It', 'what', 'good', 'summer', 'vacation', 'Everything', 'anything', 'nothing', 'specific', 'Just', 'seeking', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'possible', 'Play', 'lust', 'love', 'Maybe', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'later', 'seem', 'bit', 'reckless', 'Why', 'not', 'So', 'throw', 'film', 'same', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'just', 'let', 'take', 'wherever', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'two', 'guys', 'do', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'permanent', 'records', 'Everyone', 'can', 'find', 'connection', 'flick', 'age', 'sexuality', 'carefree', 'time', 'life', 'almost', 'too', 'long', 'ever', 'so', 'fleeting', 'lost', 'gone', 'away', 'time', 'when', 'are', 'content', 'simply', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'live', 'undue', 'concern', 'outcomes', 'serious', 'consequences', 'missteps', 'way.For', 'teens', 'what', 'summer', 'be', 'twenties', 'what', 'summers', 'used', 'be', 'just', 'short', 'time', 'ago', 'everyone', 'else', 'salient', 'recollection', 'what', 'summers', 'used', 'be', 'long', 'ago.Other', 'good', 'movies', 'genre', 'Come', 'Undone', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'Amazon', 'review', 'yet', 'good', 'title']",Nico and Dani

674186,A26L2EQ97ML3OW,B00005QAPW,"""bruce452""","[58, 59]","This is another film that has been touted as the next ""Beautiful Thing,"" but it was not the director's intention to make a love story like that.  Rather, this is a series of snapshots of a few days in the lives of two Spanish boys who are heading down different forks in the road.  Though clocked at 90 minutes the movie speeds by in seemingly half that time.Nico is coming to visit Dani at the coast while Dani's parents are away; he is intending to do the same thing he would do if he stayed home in Barcelona, went to Rome, or, for that matter, orbited in the Space Shuttle:  chase skirts.  Dani has begun to hear the tapping of a different drummer and has apparently had a lot of time to plan all the ways he wants to share his new interests with his long time pal.  Clearly these two have been very close.  Krammpack (mutual masturbation), the original title of the play, is not just something they've read about in magazines.The movie is a series of fast moving vignettes of the two boys and the two girls they meet and interact with.  They move from incident to incident quickly, not lingering long nor introspecting much about what has happened.  Though the age of the two is not clear (I've read as young as 15, as old as 17) it is made clear they are both virgins and minors (in much of Europe, 16 is the age of consent).There are some unsettling undertones as Dani experiments with sexuality, mas or menos, oblivious for some time to the fact Nico is increasingly uncomfortable with the moves he is putting on him.  There is a very unsettling, for me, date rape scene, involving the hoary old concoction Spanish Fly, not the modern date rape drug DHA.  The movie remains non-judgemental.  Director Cesc Gay keeps things from getting too heavy both by not lingering on any one incident and with musical punctuation and title cards reminscent of silent films that foreshadow upcoming scenes.  The music in the film is excellent.Nico is played by Jordi Villachi and he is a real charmer.  Though not blessed with extraordinary good looks, it is nevertheless easy to see why Dani and Elena and Berta are drawn to him.  Dani is a very handsome young man, played by Fernando Ramalla with an intensity that is at times eerie.  He is struggling with more difficult issues than Nico, of course, and has anticipated that he is facing almost certain frustration of his desires.When the two go their separate ways one evening Dani, in a lover's snit, tries tarting an older man, which is a cake walk for him, but the better angels of his nature prevail.The movie ends positively; the two's friendship survives the stresses.  Nobody is thrown into therapy nor denounced from the pulpit for their misdeeds.  Nico hasn't given up on chasing skirts and Dani has learned a lot about what he wants, as well as what he doesn't want.  The worst that Nico can bring himself to say of his friend is that he is selfish.I gave the movie four stars but if the system would have let me, I would have given it another 1/4 or 1/2 star, and if it continues to wear well with repeated viewing, as I think it will, I'll be upgrading my rating in a few months.  Nico and Dani is not ""Romeo and Julian,"" nor is it even ""Jaime and Ste,"" but it's a lot closer to them that it is to American Pie, and it's a very good movie.",4,A very good but too brief movie,1011830400,"01 24, 2002",2002,3299,"['film', 'been', 'touted', 'next', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'was', 'not', 'director', 'intention', 'make', 'love', 'story', 'Rather', 'series', 'snapshots', 'few', 'days', 'lives', 'two', 'Spanish', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'heading', 'down', 'different', 'forks', 'road', 'clocked', '90', 'minutes', 'movie', 'speeds', 'seemingly', 'time.Nico', 'coming', 'visit', 'Dani', 'coast', 'Dani', 'parents', 'are', 'away', 'intending', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'would', 'do', 'stayed', 'home', 'Barcelona', 'went', 'Rome', 'matter', 'orbited', 'Space', 'Shuttle', 'chase', 'skirts', 'Dani', 'begun', 'hear', 'tapping', 'different', 'drummer', 'apparently', 'had', 'lot', 'time', 'plan', 'ways', 'share', 'new', 'interests', 'long', 'time', 'pal', 'Clearly', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'close', 'Krammpack', 'mutual', 'masturbation', 'original', 'title', 'play', 'not', 'just', 'something', ""'ve"", 'read', 'magazines.The', 'movie', 'series', 'fast', 'moving', 'vignettes', 'two', 'boys', 'two', 'girls', 'meet', 'interact', 'move', 'incident', 'incident', 'quickly', 'not', 'lingering', 'long', 'introspecting', 'much', 'what', 'happened', 'age', 'two', 'not', 'clear', ""'ve"", 'read', 'as', 'young', '15', 'as', 'old', '17', 'made', 'clear', 'are', 'virgins', 'minors', 'much', 'Europe', '16', 'age', 'consent', 'are', 'unsettling', 'undertones', 'Dani', 'experiments', 'sexuality', 'mas', 'menos', 'oblivious', 'time', 'fact', 'Nico', 'increasingly', 'uncomfortable', 'moves', 'putting', 'very', 'unsettling', 'date', 'rape', 'scene', 'involving', 'hoary', 'old', 'concoction', 'Spanish', 'Fly', 'not', 'modern', 'date', 'rape', 'drug', 'DHA', 'movie', 'non-judgemental', 'Director', 'Cesc', 'Gay', 'things', 'getting', 'too', 'heavy', 'not', 'lingering', 'one', 'incident', 'musical', 'punctuation', 'title', 'cards', 'reminscent', 'silent', 'films', 'foreshadow', 'upcoming', 'scenes', 'music', 'film', 'excellent.Nico', 'played', 'Jordi', 'Villachi', 'real', 'charmer', 'not', 'blessed', 'extraordinary', 'good', 'looks', 'nevertheless', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Dani', 'Elena', 'Berta', 'are', 'drawn', 'Dani', 'very', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'played', 'Fernando', 'Ramalla', 'intensity', 'times', 'eerie', 'struggling', 'more', 'difficult', 'issues', 'Nico', 'course', 'anticipated', 'facing', 'almost', 'certain', 'frustration', 'desires.When', 'two', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'one', 'evening', 'Dani', 'lover', 'snit', 'tarting', 'older', 'man', 'cake', 'walk', 'better', 'angels', 'nature', 'movie', 'positively', 'two', 'friendship', 'stresses', 'Nobody', 'thrown', 'therapy', 'denounced', 'pulpit', 'misdeeds', 'Nico', ""n't"", 'given', 'up', 'chasing', 'skirts', 'Dani', 'learned', 'lot', 'what', 'as', 'well', 'what', ""n't"", 'want', 'worst', 'Nico', 'can', 'bring', 'say', 'friend', 'selfish.I', 'gave', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'system', 'would', 'have', 'let', 'would', 'have', 'given', '1/4', '1/2', 'star', 'wear', 'well', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'think', 'will', ""'ll"", 'be', 'upgrading', 'rating', 'few', 'months', 'Nico', 'Dani', 'not', 'Romeo', 'Julian', 'even', 'Jaime', 'Ste', 'lot', 'closer', 'American', 'Pie', 'very', 'good', 'movie']",Nico and Dani

First, many say there's not enough work about gay youth and this fills that void, given the fear that some cultures have about teen sexuality, and specifically male-on-male action.  Many people say actions come before identfications.  There are adults who are far different from the children they were ""playing doctor.""  This movie shows what happens as boys who mess around start to have a sexual identity and that sometimes this leads to two divergent paths.  Many accounts say that boys fool around until somebody says something homophobic and the boys are faced with harsh reality.  Imagine if the couple in ""Brokeback Mountain"" were teens, rather  than adults.  Some of those same tensions and realities are present here.This work is realistic in that it features two pimply, fun-chasing, law-breaking teens.

The underlying tension between Nico and Dani over a summer's visit is a constant theme, one that can certainly be familiar to gay people.  So much of the time, teenage gay movies either tend to be maudlin, mushy or just plain depressing.  This movie is none of those.  Another refreshing aspect of the film is that it doesn't try to tie all the loose ends up at the end of the film. I bought the movie and viewed it without reading all the reviews because wanted to view it fresh without preconceptions, and I won't detail it any more than this. It is light as a feather in many ways, which was what I was looking for.  I bought the DVD and recommend that any other buyer look at the interviews with Cesc Gay and the main cast members after seeing the movie.  Another point:  the movie I received was ""unrated"" but I have no idea why this would even be R-rated.  There was no gratuitous nudity, only a topless girl in one scene.

674196,A2UA0ESQURTZL,B00005QAPW,Michael Layton,"[12, 12]",This film is about what two 15/16 year old males do when left to their own devices.  This takes place in Spain and the twist is one of the boys begins to fall for the other. I could see an American version of this turning into American Pie 3 but not in this Spanish version.  All aspects of the film are handled in a sensitive and realistic way.  The natural awkwardness and shyness of the boys combined with their very childlike excitement of being on their own comes across as very natural.  The young actors did a great job.

They hit on some girls at Nico's insistence without giving up their old pastime of krampack.  When Dani realizes that he is in love with Nico, he begins acting like an idiot: he grabs at Nico's privates when he is having sex with a girl, tells the girl that Nico is really a maricon, then pushes himself onto the local mature, sophisticated writer but runs out before they hit the bedroom.What I find insulting about this film is that the boys never say the ""gay"" word, but they express their hatred of ""maricones"" quite often. I don't mind the director trying to pretend that gay history and culture don't exist, but it is offensive to tell a story about same-sex love that simulataneously preaches hatred of gay people.",1,oddly homophobic story of gay love,1059264000,"07 27, 2003",2003,854,"['Dani', 'who', 'affluent', 'family', 'somewhere', 'southern', 'coast', 'Spain', 'summertime', 'visit', 'old', 'friend', 'Nico', 'hit', 'girls', 'Nico', 'insistence', 'giving', 'up', 'old', 'pastime', 'krampack', 'When', 'Dani', 'love', 'Nico', 'acting', 'idiot', 'Nico', 'privates', 'when', 'having', 'sex', 'girl', 'girl', 'Nico', 'really', 'maricon', 'then', 'local', 'mature', 'sophisticated', 'writer', 'out', 'hit', 'bedroom.What', 'find', 'insulting', 'film', 'boys', 'never', 'say', 'gay', 'word', 'express', 'hatred', 'maricones', 'quite', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'director', 'trying', 'pretend', 'gay', 'history', 'culture', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'offensive', 'tell', 'story', 'same-sex', 'love', 'simulataneously', 'hatred', 'gay', 'people']",Nico and Dani

674200,A35TD8QAUMV0DB,B00005QAPW,Stephen G.,"[2, 4]","If you had asked me what I had thought of the movie half way through, I would have said I was slightly uneasy with it as a whole. What I mean to say is that there are just a few parts that you might catch your mind rejecting as too frank. I found myself identifying completely with the characters on my screen, and yet at the same moment feeling uneasy for some reason...Luckily, I didn't stop half way through and the story worked itself out and developed into something to be remembered. As soon as the credits began to roll, I realized the reason I had an uneasy feeling was because the acting was so natural and real that I felt as if I was there, and since this is a coming of age story it brought back the same feelings I felt when I was going through the things I saw on screen.The story is well written as a whole and portrays every character as actual people, even those with a smaller role. Nothing is over dramatized, and nothing is boring. It's life, shown in a way you usually don't see on film and showing an important part of life.Another reviewer didn't see much in the cinematography, but I enjoyed it. Many times, the unique ""set ups"" and irony that you see when a play is performed on stage is lost when it is made for cinema, but the director did an excellent job of preserving it. Make sure and watch the ""Special Features"" after the film and you'll see what I mean. Not necessarily things you will consciously notice while watching the film, but they work to make the film what it is.Others have said it is homophobic, which is true to a point. But I -like most- don't look back on my experiences as an adolescent and think how reaffirming everyone was and how sure I was about everything that I did. Homophobia is a reality for many people in their life and this movie doesn't brush that under the carpet for atmosphere.If you've seen a lot of gay cinema, you will be pleased to know this is anything but the ""same old thing"" and I recommend it with 4 stars. If you're just exploring gay themed movies, you might should add this one to your wish list and check back after you've seen Beautiful Thing, The Priest, The Trip, etc.",4,"Frank, honest, and realistic and a story to identify with",1086998400,"06 12, 2004",2004,2150,"['had', 'asked', 'what', 'had', 'thought', 'movie', 'half', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'slightly', 'uneasy', 'whole', 'What', 'mean', 'say', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'parts', 'might', 'catch', 'mind', 'rejecting', 'too', 'frank', 'found', 'identifying', 'completely', 'characters', 'screen', 'yet', 'same', 'moment', 'feeling', 'uneasy', 'reason', 'Luckily', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'half', 'way', 'story', 'worked', 'out', 'developed', 'something', 'be', 'remembered', 'As', 'soon', 'credits', 'began', 'roll', 'realized', 'reason', 'had', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'was', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'natural', 'real', 'felt', 'was', 'there', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'brought', 'back', 'same', 'feelings', 'felt', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'things', 'saw', 'screen.The', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'whole', 'character', 'actual', 'people', 'even', 'smaller', 'role', 'Nothing', 'dramatized', 'nothing', 'boring', 'life', 'shown', 'way', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'showing', 'important', 'part', 'life.Another', 'reviewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'cinematography', 'enjoyed', 'Many', 'times', 'unique', 'set', 'ups', 'irony', 'see', 'when', 'play', 'performed', 'stage', 'lost', 'when', 'made', 'cinema', 'director', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'preserving', 'Make', 'sure', 'watch', 'Special', 'Features', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'things', 'will', 'consciously', 'notice', 'watching', 'film', 'work', 'make', 'film', 'what', 'have', 'said', 'homophobic', 'true', 'point', '-like', 'most-', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'back', 'experiences', 'adolescent', 'think', 'how', 'reaffirming', 'everyone', 'was', 'how', 'sure', 'was', 'everything', 'did', 'Homophobia', 'reality', 'many', 'people', 'life', 'movie', ""n't"", 'brush', 'carpet', 'atmosphere.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'gay', 'cinema', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'know', 'anything', 'same', 'old', 'thing', 'recommend', '4', 'stars', ""'re"", 'just', 'exploring', 'gay', 'themed', 'movies', 'might', 'should', 'add', 'one', 'wish', 'list', 'check', 'back', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'Priest', 'Trip', 'etc']",Nico and Dani
