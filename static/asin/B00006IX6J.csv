717403,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00006IX6J,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[8, 10]","I obtained this video several years ago, when I was looking for a shorter yoga workout to perform when I had less time (most of my other videos back then were in the 40-60 minutes range).  I also wanted something that was gentle and relaxing as opposed to a more ""power yoga"" style, so this Gaiam title--with instructor Suzanne Deason, who I like--seemed like it would fit the bill. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in this practice, which feels rushed rather than relaxing. Although Deason's voice is soothing and she cues well, she moves so quickly from pose to pose that there's little opportunity to enjoy the positions. Furthermore, the use of props only hinders and further complicates this practice--if the workout moved at a slower pace, the props would be a nice addition, allowing those with less flexibility to attain the poses, but because the transitions are so fast, I spent most of my time worrying about where the props were supposed to be positioned, leaving little time to relax in the poses. If you are looking for a short, relaxing yoga practice, there are much better alternatives out there, from Patricia Walden's PM Yoga to Barbara Benagh'sYoga for Stress Relief (With The Dalai Lama), which has both shorter and longer segments.One final note: although all of the videos in the Living Arts ""for beginners"" series are advertised as being 20 minutes, the times vary a bit; this practice is actually just under 17 minutes, making it both too fast and too short to get a full relaxation experience.",2,"Good instructor, but practice too rushed to be relaxing",1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,1524,"['obtained', 'video', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'looking', 'shorter', 'yoga', 'workout', 'perform', 'when', 'had', 'less', 'time', 'most', 'other', 'videos', 'back', 'then', 'were', '40-60', 'minutes', 'range', 'also', 'wanted', 'something', 'was', 'gentle', 'relaxing', 'as', 'opposed', 'more', 'power', 'yoga', 'style', 'Gaiam', 'title', 'instructor', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'who', 'like', 'seemed', 'would', 'fit', 'bill', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'practice', 'rushed', 'rather', 'relaxing', 'Deason', 'voice', 'soothing', 'well', 'so', 'quickly', 'pose', 'pose', 'little', 'opportunity', 'enjoy', 'positions', 'Furthermore', 'use', 'props', 'only', 'hinders', 'further', 'complicates', 'practice', 'workout', 'moved', 'slower', 'pace', 'props', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'addition', 'allowing', 'less', 'flexibility', 'attain', 'poses', 'transitions', 'are', 'so', 'fast', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'worrying', 'where', 'props', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'positioned', 'leaving', 'little', 'time', 'relax', 'poses', 'are', 'looking', 'short', 'relaxing', 'yoga', 'practice', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'alternatives', 'there', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'PM', 'Yoga', 'Barbara', ""Benagh'sYoga"", 'Stress', 'Relief', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'shorter', 'longer', 'segments.One', 'final', 'note', 'videos', 'Living', 'Arts', 'beginners', 'series', 'are', 'advertised', 'being', '20', 'minutes', 'times', 'vary', 'bit', 'practice', 'actually', 'just', '17', 'minutes', 'making', 'too', 'fast', 'too', 'short', 'get', 'full', 'relaxation', 'experience']",Stress Relief Yoga

I always recommend it for beginners who want to try yoga because the poses she uses are not too difficult, and she uses a brick and a strap (good for those who are not very flexible).I still enjoy doing this DVD now, from time to time, and feel very relaxed and refreshed - although I find it is not challenging enough for me anymore.  But if you are looking for a good introduction to yoga, I recommend this DVD highly.

I've got where I prefer it to both the a.m. and p.m. videos in this same series.It includes everything a good yoga practice should:  a warm up, standing poses, twists, backbend, forward bends and relaxation.  Emphasis on loosening the shoulders, and opening the lungs.Naturally, in trying to include so much in such a short time, there are parts that feel a bit rushed, which is the video's main flaw.

When the headache started kicking in late this morning, I debated:  Should I pop a few pills or try the ""Stress Relief Yoga"" program I found when I cleaned out my media cabinet yesterday.  Since I pretty much take medicine only as a last resort, the program won.And, to my astonishment, I experienced almost immediately relief after the first two stretches/poses.  My muscles felt stretched and relaxed and I could feel air pouring into my lungs.  As I continued the work-out, my sinuses actually started to clear, I felt energized and calm.  So I think this program was AMAZING for my purposes.I did have some quibbles regarding equipment - you'll need a yoga block and a strap to do this routine - I had to improvise.  Also, the pace is pretty brisk, but I was able to keep up, and I am someone who has NO experience with Yoga.But after doing this workout, I am determined to learn more about Yoga and to find an affordable class around here.

The other cover, in addition to the two shown in this listing, can be seen here:http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Stress-Relief-Suzanne-Deason/dp/B000YV1L1M/ref=sr_1_6?s=movies-tv&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1331994858&sr;=1-6REVIEW:Contains a 20 minute stress relief practice. It moves quickly. It is not the most strenuous practice but does require a decent amount of forward bending flexibility. Garundasana (eagle) is arms only, but if you know the pose you can add the legs. I have done and taught yoga for many years and I still find this routine relaxing (but not taxing). Is it the hardest yoga routine ever? no. Will it make you look cut and buff like a body builder? no. But it is relaxing and soothing, as promised. If you want a longer practice, pause the DVD and hold the poses longer.Also included is a short restorative practice. Many people who have not tried restorative yoga dismiss it, but reclining in specific supported positions can actually help calm the mind and ease fatigue. The poses presented here are good ones. If you have never tried restorative, you can see what it is like here.A NEGATIVE: The quality of these DVDs is not high def. On my 27"" computer screen they are banded and pixelated when watching full screen. I suspect they were made from the original VHS tapes.This is not the biggest deal, because they are to DO the practice, not to sit and watch like a movie, but I thought since they keep issuing new editions the technical quality would keep up with the times.It seems a bit disingenuous for Gaim to keep issuing the same material, without any improvement in quality, every few years with a different cover. I have 2 sitting on my desk right now because from the descriptions I thought they were different content. So, if you were wondering whether to get ""Stress Relief Yoga"" with Suzanne Deason or ""Yoga for Stress Relief"" wonder no more: they are the exact same content.
