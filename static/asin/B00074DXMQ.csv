876711,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,B00074DXMQ,Amy Lynn,"[7, 7]","Ive seen all six of the newer low budget serial killer movies that have been released recently. This is the sixth. The story is about 17 yr old Charles Starkweather and his 14 yr old girlfriend at the time Carol Ann Fugate who terrorized America with a brutal killing spree in the late 1950's. Set in the midwest, it takes us on the journey starting in Nebraska through Wyoming where Charlie is later caught. This is the shocking true story that inspired films such as ''Natural Born Killers'', Kalifornia and True Romance.Compared to the other serial killer movies , this one falls somewhere in the middle. Not unwatchable but not what i would call good. It could have been better. This film did have somthing the others didnt, it had some extras on it. Out of all the films released so far , Ramirez and Gacy were the worst, i wouldnt recomend them, The best ones out are Dahmer, Bundy and Ed Gein. This one is not the worst but far from the best. The acting was so so.I found it kind of strange , in the extras segment , the actor who played Charles Starkweather says '' Obviously he made some poor choices but I dont think he was so much of an evil person'', ''he just kind of snapped and kept going''. Yeah , he snapped alright. He killed a family and strangers in cold blood. Id say thats pretty evil. When the actor said this maybe it was because Charles suffered from some kind of pyschosis and couldnt control himself, but i dont buy it. I think he wanted to kill. Maybe he seemed more evil because we didnt get to see many parts of his childhood or growing up the way we saw in Dahmer, Ed and Bundy.This movie only shows a couple clips from his early years and it didnt tell us much. Just that he has an evil imaginary friend that tells him hes weak and to kill. I didnt really feel for this character. I couldnt feel his emotions. He supposedly did it for his girlfriend but it didnt make much sense. It seems he just used that reason to kill.If youre really interested in this case id say get the DVD but if youre just a casual lover of true crime you can take it or leave it. Its decent but I doubt you will want to watch it frequently. Overall mildy entertaining. Lacks in A lot of areas.",3,''Not Bad'',1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,2202,"['Ive', 'seen', 'six', 'newer', 'low', 'budget', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'recently', 'sixth', 'story', '17', 'yr', 'old', 'Charles', 'Starkweather', '14', 'yr', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'time', 'Carol', 'Ann', 'Fugate', 'who', 'terrorized', 'America', 'brutal', 'killing', 'spree', 'late', '1950', 'Set', 'midwest', 'journey', 'starting', 'Nebraska', 'Wyoming', 'where', 'Charlie', 'later', 'caught', 'shocking', 'true', 'story', 'inspired', 'films', 'such', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'Kalifornia', 'True', 'Romance.Compared', 'other', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies', 'one', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'Not', 'unwatchable', 'not', 'what', 'i', 'would', 'call', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'somthing', 'others', 'didnt', 'had', 'extras', 'films', 'released', 'so', 'far', 'Ramirez', 'Gacy', 'were', 'worst', 'i', 'wouldnt', 'recomend', 'best', 'ones', 'out', 'are', 'Dahmer', 'Bundy', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'one', 'not', 'worst', 'far', 'best', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'so.I', 'found', 'kind', 'strange', 'extras', 'segment', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Charles', 'Starkweather', 'Obviously', 'made', 'poor', 'choices', 'dont', 'think', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'evil', 'person', 'just', 'kind', 'snapped', 'kept', 'going', 'Yeah', 'snapped', 'alright', 'killed', 'family', 'strangers', 'cold', 'blood', 'Id', 'say', 'thats', 'pretty', 'evil', 'When', 'actor', 'said', 'maybe', 'was', 'Charles', 'suffered', 'kind', 'pyschosis', 'couldnt', 'control', 'i', 'dont', 'buy', 'think', 'wanted', 'kill', 'Maybe', 'seemed', 'more', 'evil', 'didnt', 'get', 'see', 'many', 'parts', 'childhood', 'growing', 'up', 'way', 'saw', 'Dahmer', 'Ed', 'Bundy.This', 'movie', 'only', 'couple', 'clips', 'early', 'years', 'tell', 'much', 'Just', 'evil', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'weak', 'kill', 'didnt', 'really', 'feel', 'character', 'couldnt', 'feel', 'emotions', 'supposedly', 'did', 'girlfriend', 'didnt', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'just', 'used', 'reason', 'kill.If', 'youre', 'really', 'interested', 'case', 'say', 'get', 'DVD', 'youre', 'just', 'casual', 'lover', 'true', 'crime', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'decent', 'doubt', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'frequently', 'Overall', 'mildy', 'entertaining', 'Lacks', 'A', 'lot', 'areas']",N/A

876713,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00074DXMQ,California Dreaming,"[1, 1]","I just read recently that Caril Anne Fugate was in a serious car crash in Michigan, serious enough to kill her husband and put her into critical condition.  My guess:  not too many tears were flowing about this incident, except perhaps tears for her husband.I will admit that I'm ambivalent on this one myself.  While I believe that Ms. Fugate's sentence was too short -- why are women treated so vastly different and better by our judicial system than men? -- it's probably a bad idea to take pleasure in someone else's pain.  Yes, Schadenfruede was probably invented by the Germans, but most likely, it was perfected by Americans.But Ms. Fugate and her sidekick Charley Starkweather -- it seems that everyone who knew him called him &#34;Charley,&#34; at least according to this film, while he is now referred to as &#34;Charles&#34; -- no doubt brought a lot of pain to everyone else in their short but dastardly crime spree.  I watch a show called &#34;Twisted&#34; on the ID network, a show that I highly recommend, and these two lovebirds were featured on one of the episodes.  I've seen one or two other documentaries about them, most likely not as good as that one, so do I know this story fairly well.  And in this case I think having knowledge didn't hurt while watching this film; &#34;Starkweather&#34; remains fairly loyal to the story even while Mr. Starkweather was seemingly loyal to no one.And he wasn't even completely loyal to Ms. Fugate, as he ratted her out when he was eventually captured.  Once again, I'm ambivalent.  It seems that if he were a &#34;nice guy&#34; --- we surely know now that he wasn't -- he would have fallen on the sword for her.  But at the same time, she was involved and should have probably at least taken a symbolic knife.I like the music in this film; it seems to be fitting for the timeframe.  And the costumes were good as well; even though I wasn't alive back then they seem authentic.  The acting is not too sharp, reminding me a bit of the acting in &#34;Blue Velvet&#34; a bit.  But David Lynch seemed to take pleasure in wooden acting on purpose (God only knows why and I've complained about it before) while this film acted as if the acting was supposed to be good.And I also liked the fact that this film seems to come from the perspective of the two perps.  It could have come from the police, or even the victims, but I have to admit:  I actually tend to like true-crime films that take this position.  They try to at least show some possible motivations for the crimes that way.  And it was interesting to me that the writer and the director implied that Mr. Starkweather heard &#34;voices&#34; that told him to do bad things, and they used the same technique used in the underrated film &#34;Mr. Brooks&#34; with Kevin Costner to show that.  That's all that I will say to not &#34;ruin&#34; &#34;Mr. Brooks&#34; for you if you haven't yet screened it.This film might be more like a 3.5, but I'm rounding up for effort and attention to true-life details.  A lot of directors would have messed this thing up, as Mr. Starkweather messed up so many lives.  But luckily for us, that didn't seem to happen here.",4,Stark Criminals,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,3166,"['just', 'read', 'recently', 'Caril', 'Anne', 'Fugate', 'was', 'serious', 'car', 'crash', 'Michigan', 'serious', 'enough', 'kill', 'husband', 'put', 'critical', 'condition', 'guess', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'tears', 'were', 'flowing', 'incident', 'perhaps', 'tears', 'husband.I', 'will', 'admit', ""'m"", 'ambivalent', 'one', 'believe', 'Ms.', 'Fugate', 'sentence', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'why', 'are', 'women', 'treated', 'so', 'vastly', 'different', 'better', 'judicial', 'system', 'men', 'probably', 'bad', 'idea', 'take', 'pleasure', 'someone', 'else', 'pain', 'Yes', 'Schadenfruede', 'was', 'probably', 'invented', 'Germans', 'most', 'likely', 'was', 'perfected', 'Americans.But', 'Ms.', 'Fugate', 'sidekick', 'Charley', 'Starkweather', 'everyone', 'who', 'knew', 'called', '34', 'Charley', '34', 'least', 'according', 'film', 'now', 'referred', '34', 'Charles', '34', 'doubt', 'brought', 'lot', 'pain', 'everyone', 'else', 'short', 'dastardly', 'crime', 'spree', 'watch', 'show', 'called', '34', 'Twisted', '34', 'ID', 'network', 'show', 'highly', 'recommend', 'two', 'lovebirds', 'were', 'featured', 'one', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'documentaries', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'so', 'do', 'know', 'story', 'fairly', 'well', 'case', 'think', 'having', 'knowledge', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'watching', 'film', '34', 'Starkweather', '34', 'fairly', 'loyal', 'story', 'even', 'Mr.', 'Starkweather', 'was', 'seemingly', 'loyal', 'one.And', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'completely', 'loyal', 'Ms.', 'Fugate', 'ratted', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'eventually', 'captured', 'Once', 'again', ""'m"", 'ambivalent', 'were', '34', 'nice', 'guy', '34', 'surely', 'know', 'now', 'was', ""n't"", 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'sword', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'involved', 'should', 'have', 'probably', 'least', 'taken', 'symbolic', 'knife.I', 'music', 'film', 'be', 'fitting', 'timeframe', 'costumes', 'were', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'alive', 'back', 'then', 'seem', 'authentic', 'acting', 'not', 'too', 'sharp', 'reminding', 'bit', 'acting', '34', 'Blue', 'Velvet', '34', 'bit', 'David', 'Lynch', 'seemed', 'take', 'pleasure', 'wooden', 'acting', 'purpose', 'God', 'only', 'why', ""'ve"", 'complained', 'film', 'acted', 'acting', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'good.And', 'also', 'liked', 'fact', 'film', 'come', 'perspective', 'two', 'perps', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'police', 'even', 'victims', 'have', 'admit', 'actually', 'tend', 'like', 'true-crime', 'films', 'take', 'position', 'try', 'least', 'show', 'possible', 'motivations', 'crimes', 'way', 'was', 'interesting', 'writer', 'director', 'implied', 'Mr.', 'Starkweather', 'heard', '34', 'voices', '34', 'told', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'used', 'same', 'technique', 'used', 'underrated', 'film', '34', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', '34', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'show', 'will', 'say', 'not', '34', 'ruin', '34', '34', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', '34', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'screened', 'it.This', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'more', '3.5', ""'m"", 'rounding', 'up', 'effort', 'attention', 'true-life', 'details', 'lot', 'directors', 'would', 'have', 'messed', 'thing', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Starkweather', 'messed', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'luckily', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'happen', 'here']",N/A

It was Kind of creepy since it is a true story,and there is no better Horror movie than one that is based in reality in my view. As far as production it has excellent period Vehicles and costumes and everything looks lived in.The only bad part is In the scene where Starkweather kills Fugate's parents there is some of the all time worst acting I've ever seen By the woman who plays Fugate's mother. The actress there was so bad it almost ruins the movie,No idea why they just did not get another actress or  not give her any lines, one or the other . On the upside Lance Henrickson's Spooky voice ads to the film as a Dark Imaginary Figure that always seems to be there to spur on Starkweather.I believe Psychotic individuals  who see people others cant has been done to Death in Movies but it works again here very well. Probably this imaginary friend  figure was an invention of the screenwriters But in any case the real life Starkweather claimed  to have odd visions,including a Hairy Female [Bigfoot like] creature that came to his window when he was a Kid.
