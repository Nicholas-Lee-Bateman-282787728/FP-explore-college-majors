It seems the main focus is on the 'Modern Life is Rubbish' era (no complaints there). It gently grazes towards the 'Parklife' chapter very briefly and it seems to be a product as a result of the 'Leisure' area. Like another review stated: ""It doesn't appear to be in a linear sequence,"" which is fine, but sort of confusing if you don't know anything about the band. The bonus features are great and well worth it for any fan. I suggest buying the ""No Distance Left To Run"" DVD first or read Alex James' book ""A Bit of A Blur"" (amazing book) before purchasing this film.",4,I Spy In the Night Sky,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,642,"[""'Starshaped"", 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'add', 'Blur', 'collection', 'main', 'focus', ""'Modern"", 'Life', 'Rubbish', 'era', 'complaints', 'there', 'gently', ""'Parklife"", 'chapter', 'very', 'briefly', 'be', 'product', 'result', ""'Leisure"", 'area', 'review', 'stated', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'linear', 'sequence', 'fine', 'sort', 'confusing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'band', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'fan', 'suggest', 'buying', 'No', 'Distance', 'Left', 'Run', 'DVD', 'first', 'read', 'Alex', 'James', 'book', 'Bit', 'A', 'Blur', 'amazing', 'book', 'purchasing', 'film']",N/A
852504,A3Q83VI243WI7U,B0002Z0F1W,Michael Topper,"[8, 9]","The period documented by this newly refurbished DVD re-release of ""Starshaped""--roughly 1991-93--was without a doubt one of the highlights in the history of this now-venerable UK act.  Fresh from their initial flush of success, but before they became ubiquitous superstars, ""Starshaped"" features some spirited live performances and backstage footage that offers a more intimate look at the group than their Best Of collection of videos.  The camera focuses most naturally on frontman Albarn, although time is also given to Graham Coxton's quirky and likeable personality, as he cheerily complains of headaches, dehydration and the effects of being on sedatives.Some fine footage of ""Colin Zeal, ""Popscene"", ""For Tomorrow"" and ""Day After Day"" garnish the original video, now with addedconcert footage from Kilburn and the Princess Charlotte in '91.The band is in transition from its earlier, trancy, Stone Roses-influenced sound to the Kink-esque form of ""Modern Life Is Rubbish"", but it all sounds like excellent guitar-pop witha heavy psychedelic rush, loving social comment and and topped by Albarn's signature vocal style.  He certainly doesn't lack energy throughout, and frequently gets himself into trouble with his on-stage shenanigans (ie when the PA falls on his foot), giving the film at times a Spinal Tap quality (they even visit Stonehenge), although it's all with tongue well in cheek.  Blur were probably at their most likeable at this stage, an up-and coming group who would conquer the UK in only a year's time from the release of ""Starshaped"", a document which certainly gives ample enough justification for their rise and whose US release is now very welcome.",5,Their best period now on DVD,1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,1678,"['period', 'documented', 'newly', 'refurbished', 'DVD', 're-release', 'Starshaped', 'roughly', '1991-93', 'was', 'doubt', 'one', 'highlights', 'history', 'now-venerable', 'UK', 'act', 'Fresh', 'initial', 'flush', 'success', 'became', 'ubiquitous', 'superstars', 'Starshaped', 'spirited', 'live', 'performances', 'backstage', 'footage', 'more', 'intimate', 'look', 'group', 'Best', 'collection', 'videos', 'camera', 'most', 'naturally', 'frontman', 'Albarn', 'time', 'also', 'given', 'Graham', 'Coxton', 'quirky', 'likeable', 'personality', 'cheerily', 'headaches', 'dehydration', 'effects', 'being', 'sedatives.Some', 'fine', 'footage', 'Colin', 'Zeal', 'Popscene', 'Tomorrow', 'Day', 'Day', 'garnish', 'original', 'video', 'now', 'addedconcert', 'footage', 'Kilburn', 'Princess', 'Charlotte', ""'91.The"", 'band', 'transition', 'earlier', 'trancy', 'Stone', 'Roses-influenced', 'sound', 'Kink-esque', 'form', 'Modern', 'Life', 'Rubbish', 'like', 'excellent', 'guitar-pop', 'witha', 'heavy', 'psychedelic', 'rush', 'loving', 'social', 'comment', 'topped', 'Albarn', 'signature', 'vocal', 'style', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'lack', 'energy', 'frequently', 'trouble', 'on-stage', 'shenanigans', 'ie', 'when', 'PA', 'foot', 'giving', 'film', 'times', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'quality', 'even', 'visit', 'Stonehenge', 'tongue', 'well', 'cheek', 'Blur', 'were', 'probably', 'most', 'likeable', 'stage', 'up-and', 'coming', 'group', 'who', 'would', 'conquer', 'UK', 'only', 'year', 'time', 'release', 'Starshaped', 'document', 'certainly', 'ample', 'enough', 'justification', 'rise', 'US', 'release', 'now', 'very', 'welcome']",N/A

The film itself is a great tour documentary of the band in what I'd consider it's most creative, and volatile period.  They were very drunk back then too, which shows.  but the live performances are killer and the behind the scenes footage is very entertaining.  Plus the dvd version is expanded with a full concert from Kilburn that sounds excellent and very hi-fi, with a great setlist.  Plus there are four tracks from a camcorder of a very very early blur performance that is just in shambles, but still a whole lot of fun, and the sound on that is quite good considering the very lo-fi source.This is can't miss stuff for any blur fan.  Especially for the full concert that is included here.  That's worth the admission price alone.",5,A must have,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,785,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'problems', 'sound', 'dvd', 'film', 'great', 'tour', 'documentary', 'band', 'what', ""'d"", 'consider', 'most', 'creative', 'volatile', 'period', 'were', 'very', 'drunk', 'back', 'then', 'too', 'live', 'performances', 'are', 'killer', 'scenes', 'footage', 'very', 'entertaining', 'dvd', 'version', 'expanded', 'full', 'concert', 'Kilburn', 'excellent', 'very', 'hi-fi', 'great', 'setlist', 'are', 'four', 'tracks', 'camcorder', 'very', 'very', 'early', 'blur', 'performance', 'just', 'shambles', 'still', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'sound', 'quite', 'good', 'considering', 'very', 'lo-fi', 'source.This', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'stuff', 'blur', 'fan', 'Especially', 'full', 'concert', 'included', 'here', 'admission', 'price', 'alone']",N/A

This film takes us on the road with Blue as they go to Glastonbury and other festivals.This is a bit dissapointing, as it really doesnt go into depth that much about the band, instead just meandering from one shot to the next, interspersed with some cute camera tricks which I guess was avante garde for the time, but now is pretty lame.But still, this disc is pretty amazing. The bonus material makes up for it. There is footage from 2 concerts on here, 1 was made for british tv, and runs for a good hour, and is packed with songs I don't recognize. This was apparently made just when Blur was signed to a record label. It's all great, Damon and Company really give it their all, and is quite fun.The 2nd bit goes even EARLIER then that. This looks to be footage shot by a fan, and is all somewhat bizarre. They're on the smallest stage possible, Alburn looks like a Hogwart. It's all so so surreal, but still quite fascinating to watch.
