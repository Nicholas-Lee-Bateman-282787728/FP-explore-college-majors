Hutto,"[1, 1]","well the first thing to note is watch the second disc first...the first disc i think occurs somewhere in the middle of the first disc but it is never referenced and really just feels weird and out of place.the main plot is two characters want to confess their love for each other. simple enough and it generally speaking works. the problem is you have 6 episodes on disc 2 to accomplish this...5 of which are devoted to this plot. really by episode 4 knowing there isnt a lot more left you get the just get on with already. they do eventually succeed which leads to the 6th and final episode....this episode is rather good and has a rather well done finale which i think saves it.the other thing is disc 1 has 6 episodes but disc 2 only has 2? the logic in that seems weird. also each disc has episode 1 and 2 but they are different episodes so it is hard until you watch it all to figure out the order of everything.the good thing is how the story is told. the story is told fairly well. my main beef is it takes forever to get to its point. i understand people being shy. but seriously these two take 2-3 years of dancing around the fact that they like each other. there is also the fact a girl at the beginning plays off the main male character far better but she disappears after 2 episodes or so.i rated this 4 stars because the ending is good, the story is told rather well, the animation is solid and overall its a fairly relaxing show to kick back with. the characters are all fairly likable for the most part. the story isnt hard to follow and it was just good to not have to think. my only real complaints are disc 1 doesnt fit anywhere and they take 5 episodes to get the main lovers together.there is also the fact this is based on a manga which has far more volumes and 6 episodes is not enough but they make it work they do a good job of fleshing out the characters in these 6 episodes although the characters do for the most part stay the same till the last episode where they finally have some good character growth. the last episode really saves this thing from being terrible.",4,average anime but very solid ending and production values,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,2094,"['well', 'first', 'thing', 'note', 'second', 'disc', 'first', 'first', 'disc', 'i', 'think', 'occurs', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'first', 'disc', 'never', 'referenced', 'really', 'just', 'feels', 'weird', 'place.the', 'main', 'plot', 'two', 'characters', 'want', 'confess', 'love', 'other', 'simple', 'enough', 'generally', 'speaking', 'works', 'problem', 'have', '6', 'episodes', 'disc', '2', 'accomplish', '5', 'are', 'devoted', 'plot', 'really', 'episode', '4', 'knowing', 'there', 'lot', 'more', 'left', 'get', 'just', 'get', 'already', 'do', 'eventually', 'succeed', '6th', 'final', 'episode', '.this', 'episode', 'rather', 'good', 'rather', 'well', 'done', 'finale', 'think', 'saves', 'it.the', 'other', 'thing', 'disc', '1', '6', 'episodes', '2', 'only', '2', 'logic', 'weird', 'also', 'disc', 'episode', '1', '2', 'are', 'different', 'episodes', 'hard', 'watch', 'figure', 'out', 'order', 'everything.the', 'good', 'thing', 'how', 'story', 'told', 'story', 'told', 'fairly', 'well', 'main', 'beef', 'forever', 'get', 'point', 'i', 'understand', 'people', 'being', 'shy', 'seriously', 'two', 'take', '2-3', 'years', 'dancing', 'fact', 'like', 'other', 'also', 'fact', 'girl', 'beginning', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'far', 'better', '2', 'episodes', 'so.i', 'rated', '4', 'stars', 'ending', 'good', 'story', 'told', 'rather', 'well', 'animation', 'solid', 'overall', 'fairly', 'relaxing', 'show', 'kick', 'back', 'characters', 'are', 'fairly', 'likable', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'isnt', 'hard', 'follow', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'not', 'have', 'think', 'only', 'real', 'complaints', 'are', 'disc', '1', 'doesnt', 'fit', 'anywhere', 'take', '5', 'episodes', 'get', 'main', 'lovers', 'also', 'fact', 'based', 'manga', 'far', 'more', 'volumes', '6', 'episodes', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'work', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', '6', 'episodes', 'characters', 'do', 'most', 'part', 'stay', 'same', 'till', 'last', 'episode', 'where', 'finally', 'have', 'good', 'character', 'growth', 'last', 'episode', 'really', 'thing', 'being', 'terrible']","I""s"
1226004,A15E6GT89R2HDJ,B001P807PO,"Diego A. Arzate ""Berlioz""","[1, 1]",I was a bit unsure about buying this anime since I have read mixed reviews but now I don't regret it. This set comes with I''s which is basically two OVA episodes which serve and some filler info and I''s Pure which is the main story. It'a a 6 episode long series that deals with the conflict between a guy unable to declare his love for a girl. On top of that his childhood friend arrives who also happens to be another girl and stirs up trouble between the two. Although it's a relatively short series it's done extremely well and has an astounding amount of depth to it. The last episodes are tear-jerkers and the ending leaves you satisfied. I highly recommend this anime to anybody as it won't disappoint!!,5,An Excellent Romance Series,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,711,"['was', 'bit', 'unsure', 'buying', 'anime', 'have', 'read', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'set', 's', 'basically', 'two', 'OVA', 'episodes', 'serve', 'filler', 'info', 's', 'Pure', 'main', 'story', ""'"", '6', 'episode', 'long', 'series', 'deals', 'conflict', 'guy', 'unable', 'declare', 'love', 'girl', 'top', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'girl', 'up', 'trouble', 'two', 'relatively', 'short', 'series', 'done', 'extremely', 'well', 'astounding', 'amount', 'depth', 'last', 'episodes', 'are', 'tear-jerkers', 'ending', 'leaves', 'satisfied', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anime', 'anybody', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint']","I""s"

Ichitaka Seto is kind 0f wishy washy young fellow that has had a crush on Iori for a while. Itsuki Akiba is Ichitaka's  cute childhood friend who has returned from abroad. Put all three of them together and we have a tale of romance comedy and dreams. The course of true love never did run smooth, and hapless Ichitaka has tons of obstacles to overcome to win the heart of his classmate, Iori. Pranks, misunderstandings, stalkers, and  romantic intervention, but most of all trying to stay true to his feelings. Will they ever find happiness together, or will fate have other ideas?This anime has a pretty good story, but the it was not played out all that well. The worst flaw this series has is the awful voice acting job. The English dub is ridiculous. I've definitely heard worse dubs before, but this one is still pretty bad. The comedy and drama is pretty mediocre too. I really do think that the concept is a great idea, and I like these type's of stories, but it seemed really half baked.

1226007,A14OJS0VWMOSWO,B001P807PO,Midwest Book Review,"[5, 6]","I's is an anime (Japanese animated feature) combining drama and romance, complete in two episodes on a single DVD volume. The three I's in the story refer to Iori Hazuki, a beautiful high schooler on the verge of attaining a successful acting career; Ichitaka Seto, a classmate and acquaintance of Iori's who has secretly harbored a crush on her for years; and Itsuki Akaba, Ichitaka's cute friend who has recently returned from abroad. All three are on a remote island (cut off even from the range of cell phones), but will Ichitaka remember his childhood promise to Itsuki, let alone muster the courage to confess his feelings to Iori? When a gang of three murderous, sex-obsessed cutthroats on motorcycles threatens Itsuki, and rising floodwaters put Iori's life at risk, Ichitaka will need all the courage, ingenuity, determination and memories he can muster to save the lives of the women he loves! The result is an emotionally moving love story with a heart-wrenching twist, adapted from the manga by Masakazu Katsura (creator of the popular ""Video Girl Ai""). This volume actually contains two DVD discs of the complete two-episode series - one DVD with a 4:3 fullscreen aspect ratio, and one DVD with a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio. The audio is Japanese and English, with the option of subtitles. 120 minutes (240 minutes if one counts both discs).",5,Complete in two episodes on a single DVD volume,1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,1356,"['anime', 'Japanese', 'animated', 'feature', 'combining', 'drama', 'romance', 'complete', 'two', 'episodes', 'single', 'DVD', 'volume', 'three', 'story', 'refer', 'Iori', 'Hazuki', 'beautiful', 'high', 'schooler', 'verge', 'attaining', 'successful', 'acting', 'career', 'Ichitaka', 'Seto', 'classmate', 'acquaintance', 'Iori', 'who', 'secretly', 'harbored', 'crush', 'years', 'Itsuki', 'Akaba', 'Ichitaka', 'cute', 'friend', 'who', 'recently', 'returned', 'abroad', 'three', 'are', 'remote', 'island', 'cut', 'off', 'even', 'range', 'cell', 'phones', 'will', 'Ichitaka', 'remember', 'childhood', 'promise', 'Itsuki', 'let', 'alone', 'muster', 'courage', 'confess', 'feelings', 'Iori', 'When', 'gang', 'three', 'murderous', 'sex-obsessed', 'cutthroats', 'motorcycles', 'threatens', 'Itsuki', 'rising', 'floodwaters', 'put', 'Iori', 'life', 'risk', 'Ichitaka', 'will', 'need', 'courage', 'ingenuity', 'determination', 'memories', 'can', 'muster', 'save', 'lives', 'women', 'result', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'love', 'story', 'heart-wrenching', 'twist', 'adapted', 'manga', 'Masakazu', 'Katsura', 'creator', 'popular', 'Video', 'Girl', 'Ai', 'volume', 'actually', 'two', 'DVD', 'discs', 'complete', 'two-episode', 'series', 'one', 'DVD', '4:3', 'fullscreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'one', 'DVD', '16:9', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'audio', 'Japanese', 'English', 'option', 'subtitles', '120', 'minutes', '240', 'minutes', 'one', 'discs']","I""s"
