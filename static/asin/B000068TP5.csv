There's actually a good 60-minute story here inside an approx. 90 minute running time, so it's too bad the director didn't edit out all the boring parts and make what is now a 2 star movie into perhaps 3 stars.  One entirely boring subpolot involves a girl's pregnancy and I can't for the life of me figure out why it's there.  It's pointless and dull.  There is some nice acting and some nice visuals of the porn star and the fluffer.  Just keep your expectations LOW on this one and you might enjoy it.",2,Barely adequate,1034985600,"10 19, 2002",2002,598,"['lot', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'pretty', 'box', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'inside', 'actually', 'good', '60-minute', 'story', 'here', 'approx', '90', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'too', 'bad', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'edit', 'out', 'boring', 'parts', 'make', 'what', 'now', '2', 'star', 'movie', 'perhaps', '3', 'stars', 'One', 'entirely', 'boring', 'subpolot', 'girl', 'pregnancy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'there', 'pointless', 'dull', 'nice', 'acting', 'nice', 'visuals', 'porn', 'star', 'fluffer', 'Just', 'keep', 'expectations', 'LOW', 'one', 'might', 'enjoy']",N/A
705341,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B000068TP5,Boggman!,"[9, 12]","""The Fluffer"" boasts some moments of really good acting and some quality comedic & dramatic scenes throughout it's run. However, as a heterosexual male, this movie also had plenty of moments that left me feeling uncomfortable, and some others that were pretty outlandish.Not to familiar with movies in this genre, I thought I would give this one a go. It was worth watching, but I really wouldn't want to see it more than once.Sean is a young inexperienced gay man whose just moved to LA and is struggling to find his place in both his professional and personal life. While renting a gay X-rated film one night, he becomes intoxicated with its leading man Johnny Rebel (Scott Gurney). So he hightails it over to the company that made the film and gets himself a job as a P.A. (production assistant).This leads him to an on-set encounter with none other than Johnny Rebel- who after some ""difficulty"" shooting a particular scene, carouses young Sean over to him and asks him for a little ""help"". Hence, Sean becomes a sort of personal ""fluffer"" for Johnny when he has this difficult moments from there on....""Fluffing"" is a term that refers to someone who coaxes and erection out of a male porn actor when they are having trouble.So Sean becomes obsessed with Johnny- a guy who has plenty of demons of his own. Johnny is a straight, egotistical, arrogant crystal meth user who lives with his stripper girlfriend Julie (Roxanne Day).Things began to really spiral out of control when Julie gets pregnant, wants to have the baby, and Johnny starts to decline in his status as a ""top dog"" with the company he works for.Some scenes in ""The Fluffer"" work very nicely. The scenes with Johnny and Julia, as well as most with Johnny and Sean are very well acted and play out nicely. Johnny is a tortured soul- and you can easily feel his despair. All three of the actors did a great job with their characters.The movie takes a real downturn towards the end- with Johnny and Sean hightailing it down to Mexico for reasons you'll have to watch to find out. Johnny's descent downhill plays out too quick, and overall is pretty far fetched. There's also a small subplot with Sean trying to date some other guy that really wasn't needed in the movie.Overall, this reviewer felt the stronger half of the film was it's first half. And although the subject matter and some scenes were a little too much for me personally, the performances in ""The Fluffer"" helped greatly to make the movie work.I wouldn't want to see it again- but would say the ""The Fluffer"" is an average film with some above average acting.",3,Stuck in the middle with you......,1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,2591,"['Fluffer', 'moments', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'quality', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'run', 'However', 'heterosexual', 'male', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'plenty', 'moments', 'left', 'feeling', 'uncomfortable', 'others', 'were', 'pretty', 'outlandish.Not', 'familiar', 'movies', 'genre', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'one', 'go', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'more', 'once.Sean', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'gay', 'man', 'just', 'moved', 'LA', 'struggling', 'find', 'place', 'professional', 'personal', 'life', 'renting', 'gay', 'X-rated', 'film', 'one', 'night', 'intoxicated', 'leading', 'man', 'Johnny', 'Rebel', 'Scott', 'Gurney', 'company', 'made', 'film', 'job', 'P.A', 'production', 'assistant', '.This', 'on-set', 'encounter', 'none', 'other', 'Johnny', 'Rebel-', 'who', 'difficulty', 'shooting', 'particular', 'scene', 'young', 'Sean', 'little', 'help', 'Hence', 'Sean', 'sort', 'personal', 'fluffer', 'Johnny', 'when', 'difficult', 'moments', 'there', 'Fluffing', 'term', 'someone', 'who', 'coaxes', 'erection', 'male', 'porn', 'actor', 'when', 'are', 'having', 'trouble.So', 'Sean', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'Johnny-', 'guy', 'who', 'plenty', 'demons', 'own', 'Johnny', 'straight', 'egotistical', 'arrogant', 'crystal', 'meth', 'user', 'who', 'stripper', 'girlfriend', 'Julie', 'Roxanne', 'Day', '.Things', 'began', 'really', 'spiral', 'control', 'when', 'Julie', 'pregnant', 'have', 'baby', 'Johnny', 'decline', 'status', 'top', 'dog', 'company', 'for.Some', 'scenes', 'Fluffer', 'work', 'very', 'nicely', 'scenes', 'Johnny', 'Julia', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'Johnny', 'Sean', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'play', 'out', 'nicely', 'Johnny', 'tortured', 'soul-', 'can', 'easily', 'feel', 'despair', 'three', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'real', 'downturn', 'end-', 'Johnny', 'Sean', 'hightailing', 'down', 'Mexico', 'reasons', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'Johnny', 'descent', 'downhill', 'out', 'too', 'quick', 'overall', 'pretty', 'far', 'fetched', 'also', 'small', 'subplot', 'Sean', 'trying', 'date', 'other', 'guy', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'movie.Overall', 'reviewer', 'felt', 'stronger', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'half', 'subject', 'matter', 'scenes', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'personally', 'performances', 'Fluffer', 'helped', 'greatly', 'make', 'movie', 'work.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'again-', 'would', 'say', 'Fluffer', 'average', 'film', 'above', 'average', 'acting']",N/A

705343,A398FD7XNE6ISZ,B000068TP5,Dave Beards,"[4, 4]","Call me strange, but I have a huge facination for 'behind the scenes' movies and documentaries about the porn industry and those who perform on camera. I actually find it more facinating than porn itself. Even in our so called 'modern' society, sex is still very much mostly reserved for behind closed doors. So people who go that extra step in life and open up their sexuality for the world to see intrigue me. So when I came across this DVD - a fictious behind the scenes look at the gay porn industry and the people associated with it, I couldn't resist the urge to add it to my ever expanding DVD library.I have read alot of negative reviews from gay men and in the gay press about this movie. Perhaps they were expecting something titilating??? If you're expecting to be aroused, then look elsewhere. The Fluffer is a no holds barred look at the gay porn industry. I have read reviews from people actually involved in the industry and basically their comments where that it is very realistic as to what actually happens.The story basically comprises the downfall of a popular male porn star, and the effects this has on those around him, including his girlfriend and the guy hired to 'fluff' him but who also has a major in infatuation with him.The porn industry is presented merely as a business - and just like any profit based business, it is designed to make money. What ends up on video is just fantasy, and not realistically representative of what happens behind the scenes in the porn world or indeed in sex between 2 people. Just like 'mainstream' movies really - there is a script and people act out a fantasy. Porn is really no different. Though there is nothing wrong with fantasy!The viewer is left to make up their own mind about the porn world from this movie. It is neither presented in a positive or negative way. It's quite refeshing that the filmmakers' haven't imposed their own thoughts and judgements on the viewer. It would seem as though it is a negative assessment of the porn world, considering the downfall of the major porn character 'Johnny Rebel', but as one of the behind the secenes crew points out - working in a department store also stuff's people up, why should porn be any different?Wonderful performances from all of the cast here - especially Scott Gurney. He underplays the role for emotionally subtly to perfection.The DVD is well presented with good picture quality. The audio commentary from the two directors is wonderful - always entertaining and engaging, and they discuss many wonderful aspects of not only the movie, but the porn industry as well. A selection of deleted scenes adds interest and value - especially with the optional audio commentary. A gallery of the mocked - up porn video covers is included - and they are so realistic apparently guys were contacting the producers as to where one could purchase the movies!!! There is also an interesting extra called 'Johnny Rebel extras' - basically a composite of extended scenes and the odd outtake. Very entertaining, but far too short. A gallery of movie stills and trailers for other movies round out the selection of extras. It's great to see these small, independant features being released with an entertaining set of extras -I hope this trend continues.If you're interested in the behind the scenes aspects of the gay porn industry, and are not afraid to face reality, make sure you see this DVD.",5,An insightful look into the gay porn industry....,1042156800,"01 10, 2003",2003,3412,"['Call', 'strange', 'have', 'huge', 'facination', 'scenes', 'movies', 'documentaries', 'porn', 'industry', 'who', 'perform', 'camera', 'actually', 'find', 'more', 'facinating', 'porn', 'Even', 'so', 'called', ""'modern"", 'society', 'sex', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'mostly', 'reserved', 'behind', 'closed', 'doors', 'So', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'extra', 'step', 'life', 'open', 'up', 'sexuality', 'world', 'see', 'intrigue', 'when', 'came', 'DVD', 'fictious', 'scenes', 'look', 'gay', 'porn', 'industry', 'people', 'associated', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'urge', 'add', 'ever', 'expanding', 'DVD', 'library.I', 'have', 'read', 'alot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'gay', 'men', 'gay', 'press', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'expecting', 'something', 'titilating', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'be', 'aroused', 'then', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Fluffer', 'barred', 'look', 'gay', 'porn', 'industry', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'people', 'actually', 'involved', 'industry', 'basically', 'comments', 'where', 'very', 'realistic', 'what', 'actually', 'happens.The', 'story', 'basically', 'downfall', 'popular', 'male', 'porn', 'star', 'effects', 'including', 'girlfriend', 'guy', 'hired', ""'fluff"", 'who', 'also', 'major', 'infatuation', 'him.The', 'porn', 'industry', 'presented', 'merely', 'business', 'just', 'profit', 'based', 'business', 'designed', 'make', 'money', 'What', 'up', 'video', 'just', 'fantasy', 'not', 'realistically', 'representative', 'what', 'scenes', 'porn', 'world', 'indeed', 'sex', '2', 'people', 'Just', ""'mainstream"", 'movies', 'really', 'script', 'people', 'act', 'out', 'fantasy', 'Porn', 'really', 'different', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'fantasy', 'viewer', 'left', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'porn', 'world', 'movie', 'neither', 'presented', 'positive', 'negative', 'way', 'quite', 'refeshing', 'filmmakers', 'have', ""n't"", 'imposed', 'own', 'thoughts', 'judgements', 'viewer', 'would', 'seem', 'negative', 'assessment', 'porn', 'world', 'considering', 'downfall', 'major', 'porn', 'character', 'Rebel', 'one', 'secenes', 'crew', 'points', 'out', 'working', 'department', 'store', 'also', 'stuff', 'people', 'up', 'why', 'should', 'porn', 'be', 'different', 'Wonderful', 'performances', 'cast', 'here', 'especially', 'Scott', 'Gurney', 'role', 'emotionally', 'subtly', 'perfection.The', 'DVD', 'well', 'presented', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'audio', 'commentary', 'two', 'directors', 'wonderful', 'always', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'discuss', 'many', 'wonderful', 'aspects', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'porn', 'industry', 'as', 'well', 'selection', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interest', 'value', 'especially', 'optional', 'audio', 'commentary', 'gallery', 'mocked', 'up', 'porn', 'video', 'included', 'are', 'so', 'realistic', 'apparently', 'guys', 'were', 'contacting', 'producers', 'where', 'one', 'could', 'purchase', 'movies', 'also', 'interesting', 'extra', 'called', ""'Johnny"", 'Rebel', 'extras', 'basically', 'composite', 'extended', 'scenes', 'odd', 'outtake', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'far', 'too', 'short', 'gallery', 'movie', 'stills', 'trailers', 'other', 'movies', 'round', 'out', 'selection', 'extras', 'great', 'see', 'small', 'independant', 'features', 'being', 'released', 'entertaining', 'set', 'extras', '-I', 'hope', 'trend', 'continues.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'scenes', 'aspects', 'gay', 'porn', 'industry', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'face', 'reality', 'make', 'sure', 'see', 'DVD']",N/A

705351,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B000068TP5,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[7, 10]","""The Fluffer"" may be best described as a ""Boogie Nights"" wannabe, as it falls far short to grant adequate substance to the film's three main characters, each working within the adult entertainment industry.  Scott Gurney plays Mike 'Johnny Rebel', a muscular, straight, egocentric, narcisstic drug addict who has found success working as a ""gay-for-pay"" porn star.  Roxanne Day plays Babylon, Mike's girlfriend who works as a stripper. Michael Cunio plays Sean McGinnis, a young, naive, gay neophyte who finds a job as a cameraman with the same porn studio where Mike works.After recently moving to Hollywood with the hopes of working in the mainstream film industry, the film begins with Sean going to a local videostore.  He rents what he thinks is ""Citizen Kane"", but it turns out to be a similarly titled gay porn film starring 'Johnny Rebel'.  Sean quickly develops a crush on 'Johnny Rebel' and obsessively proceeds to rent many more porn films all starring his new idol.  Obsession leads Sean to go to the porn studio ""Men of Janus"" (where 'Johnny Rebel' works) to offer his services as a cameraman.  Sean is hired, as he also turns down an opportunity to work for a mainstream studio.During his first film shoot, Sean's dream comes true as he gets to film 'Johnny Rebel' himself.  When Mike ('Johnny Rebel'), has difficulty performing, Sean volunteers to be Mike's ""fluffer""; but to his dissappointment, he also learns that Mike is straight and only does gay porn for the money.Sean's obsession for Mike continues to plague his decisions throughout the course of the film, even as he learns that Mike isn't as wonderful as he would like to believe, as Mike is a self-absorbed, drug-addicted narcissist that treats everyone close to him very poorly, especially his girlfriend, Babylon.  Once Babylon gets pregnant, her relationship with Mike predictably sours.  By far the biggest star in the film is the singer Debbie Harry, who plays a minor role as Babylon's boss at the striptease club who consoles her over her difficulties with Mike.  As with Sean, Babylon's expectations of Mike are unrealistic.Sean's obsession for Mike leads him to go with Mike to Mexico after the ""Men of Janus"" fire Mike for showing up too late for a film shoot.  In Mexico, Sean finally realizes that he's wasting his time chasing after Mike.Of the three main characters, Roxanne Day's acting is the best, followed by Scott Gurney.  Michael Cunio's acting falls short.  Clearly Scott Gurney's presence in the film is to portray the ultimate, superficial gay male fantasy and he carries it off  well; but one of the film's major flaws is that he is never shown exercising, nor do I recall him ever talking about going to a gym.  Musculature like his would require regular 1-3 hours of exercise, 4 to 5 times per week.  How would someone as addicted to drugs as Mike is portrayed find the commitment to exercise to that extent?  The talent of the other actors in this film is wasted: Taylor Negron, Richard Riehle, Tim Bagley and Robert Walden (whose character was similar to that of Burt Reynolds in ""Boogie Nights"", but no where as good).Scott Gurney in his various show-off outfits is definitely what will draw many to watch ""The Fluffer"", but you might want to rent the film first before deciding to purchase it, especially if you are more interested in substance.",3,"A lot of skin, but not much substance",1034208000,"10 10, 2002",2002,3352,"['Fluffer', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'described', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'wannabe', 'far', 'short', 'grant', 'adequate', 'substance', 'film', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'working', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'Scott', 'Gurney', 'Mike', ""'Johnny"", 'Rebel', 'muscular', 'straight', 'egocentric', 'narcisstic', 'drug', 'addict', 'who', 'found', 'success', 'working', 'gay-for-pay', 'porn', 'star', 'Roxanne', 'Day', 'Babylon', 'Mike', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'stripper', 'Michael', 'Cunio', 'Sean', 'McGinnis', 'young', 'naive', 'gay', 'neophyte', 'who', 'job', 'cameraman', 'same', 'porn', 'studio', 'where', 'Mike', 'works.After', 'recently', 'moving', 'Hollywood', 'hopes', 'working', 'mainstream', 'film', 'industry', 'film', 'Sean', 'going', 'local', 'videostore', 'what', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'out', 'be', 'similarly', 'titled', 'gay', 'porn', 'film', 'starring', 'Rebel', 'Sean', 'quickly', 'crush', ""'Johnny"", 'Rebel', 'obsessively', 'proceeds', 'rent', 'many', 'more', 'porn', 'films', 'starring', 'new', 'idol', 'Obsession', 'Sean', 'go', 'porn', 'studio', 'Men', 'Janus', 'where', 'Rebel', 'works', 'offer', 'services', 'cameraman', 'Sean', 'hired', 'also', 'down', 'opportunity', 'work', 'mainstream', 'studio.During', 'first', 'film', 'shoot', 'Sean', 'dream', 'true', 'film', 'Rebel', 'When', 'Mike', 'Rebel', 'difficulty', 'performing', 'Sean', 'volunteers', 'be', 'Mike', 'fluffer', 'dissappointment', 'also', 'Mike', 'straight', 'only', 'gay', 'porn', 'money.Sean', 'obsession', 'Mike', 'plague', 'decisions', 'course', 'film', 'even', 'Mike', ""n't"", 'as', 'wonderful', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'Mike', 'self-absorbed', 'drug-addicted', 'narcissist', 'everyone', 'close', 'very', 'poorly', 'especially', 'girlfriend', 'Babylon', 'Once', 'Babylon', 'pregnant', 'relationship', 'Mike', 'predictably', 'far', 'biggest', 'star', 'film', 'singer', 'Debbie', 'Harry', 'who', 'minor', 'role', 'Babylon', 'boss', 'striptease', 'club', 'who', 'difficulties', 'Mike', 'Sean', 'Babylon', 'expectations', 'Mike', 'are', 'unrealistic.Sean', 'obsession', 'Mike', 'go', 'Mike', 'Mexico', 'Men', 'Janus', 'fire', 'Mike', 'showing', 'up', 'too', 'late', 'film', 'shoot', 'Mexico', 'Sean', 'finally', 'wasting', 'time', 'chasing', 'Mike.Of', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Roxanne', 'Day', 'acting', 'best', 'followed', 'Scott', 'Gurney', 'Michael', 'Cunio', 'acting', 'short', 'Clearly', 'Scott', 'Gurney', 'presence', 'film', 'portray', 'ultimate', 'superficial', 'gay', 'male', 'fantasy', 'off', 'well', 'one', 'film', 'major', 'flaws', 'never', 'shown', 'exercising', 'do', 'recall', 'ever', 'talking', 'going', 'gym', 'Musculature', 'would', 'require', 'regular', '1-3', 'hours', 'exercise', '4', '5', 'times', 'week', 'How', 'would', 'someone', 'as', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'Mike', 'portrayed', 'commitment', 'exercise', 'extent', 'talent', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'wasted', 'Taylor', 'Negron', 'Richard', 'Riehle', 'Tim', 'Bagley', 'Robert', 'Walden', 'character', 'was', 'similar', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'where', 'as', 'good', '.Scott', 'Gurney', 'various', 'show-off', 'outfits', 'definitely', 'what', 'will', 'draw', 'many', 'watch', 'Fluffer', 'might', 'want', 'rent', 'film', 'first', 'before', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'especially', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'substance']",N/A

Suffice it to say that a fluffer is someone on the set of a porn movie who makes it possible for a male porn star to maintain the illusion that he is enjoying what he is doing on screen. Women can fake it.  Men, obviously, cannot.That said, *The Fluffer* is a realistic picture about the gay porn industry.  It is also about how vanity, insecurity, helplessness, and ultimately, self-destruction, get expressed in the life of a man who appears to have everything: beauty, fame, people who love him and willingly sacrifice themselves and their own dignity - for a while anyway - to take care of him. In many more important ways, it is an almost perfectly realized cinematic exploration of the relationships between longing and fulfillment, fantasy and reality, love and obsession, the glitzy and the mundane.  It's also about growing up and the deep sources of self-respect, how for some, as Blake said, ""the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom,"" while for others, it leads to spiralling self-destruction and, finally, to despair.The movie treats all of its characters with respect almost bordering on tenderness.  The porn superstar's self-destructive dive is not played as a stereotype.  Some of the characters in this movie seem functional if not particularly happy with their lives.  Others - the three main characters really - find themselves on a pathe to either imminent self-destruction or imminent self-discovery and transformation.  The movie does present, for one thing, a morality tale.  But the general morality of porn itself is not examined in this movie.A final word: the excellent commentary track is revealing and deeply provocative, pointing out the places where the screenplay or the camera (or both) is communcating the film's dramatic insights as well as it's perfectly wrought structures.Highest recommendation.",5,"Terrific!

One day he gets out `Citizen Kane', but on sticking it in his VCR it turns out to have `Citizen Cum' in it by mistake.  He thinks well, what the heck and watches it anyway, purely out of professional interest I suppose, but gets strangely drawn to the aforementioned Mr Cum, who turns out to be Johnny Rebel (Scott Gurney).  The `classic' has been made by Men of Janus, a top notch production company that is not too far away, so clutching his resume and suppressing sexual eruptions he goes along and asks for a job.This part of the film is almost a semi(sorry bad pun) comedy, as porn is nearly always one bad line away from a smutty joke, this is fertile territory for gags (I did it again). He then meet Johnny whilst shooting (sorry this is getting worse) a scene for his next `classic'. Johnny has a predilection for nose candy and other performance enhancing substances, such as Viagra, and so can not always rise to the occasion. He asks Sean to `help him out' and he is only too willing to oblige. Sean is then hired more for his skills in the continuity department as opposed to his arty camera shots.Johnny is `pay for gay' and has a girl friend in the shape of Roxanne Day (Julie Desponsio - aka Babylon the lap dancer). She works at a club where Deborah Harry is the Madame! Whilst Sean fills in his time packing such `classic' titles as `The Iceman Cometh' and `Tranny Get Your Gun', Johnny is becoming increasingly unreliable and jeopardising everything for the studio and his relationship with Julie.  The film then veers into a more dark and nasty world, leaving behind the humorous asides that had kept my interest up. However by that point I was hooked enough to stay with it and see where it led. It has two directors (Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland) and that may be why it has different feels, but it still holds together quite well.It does not have the best cinematography ever and the acting is not always top notch, but it is a `grower' (that has to be the last pun) in the sense that I kept remembering parts and have recommended to friends. It does feature real porn stars too and you could tell it had been made with a lot of heart, so if a slightly off the wall comedic tale of love, angst and betrayal is your thing I am sure you will enjoy.",4,"""The Only Thing Worse Than Being Gay, is Being Straight""",1319932800,"10 30, 2011",2011,2468,"['film', 'Sean', 'Michael', 'Cunio', 'who', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'cameraman', 'make', 'fortune', 'etc', 'time', 'waiting', 'phone', 'ring', 'watching', 'classics', 'video', 'One', 'day', 'out', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'sticking', 'VCR', 'out', 'have', 'Citizen', 'Cum', 'mistake', 'well', 'what', 'heck', 'watches', 'anyway', 'purely', 'professional', 'interest', 'suppose', 'strangely', 'drawn', 'aforementioned', 'Mr', 'Cum', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Johnny', 'Rebel', 'Scott', 'Gurney', 'classic', 'been', 'made', 'Men', 'Janus', 'top', 'notch', 'production', 'company', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'clutching', 'resume', 'suppressing', 'sexual', 'eruptions', 'along', 'job.This', 'part', 'film', 'almost', 'semi', 'sorry', 'bad', 'pun', 'comedy', 'porn', 'nearly', 'always', 'one', 'bad', 'line', 'away', 'smutty', 'joke', 'fertile', 'territory', 'gags', 'did', 'again', 'then', 'meet', 'Johnny', 'shooting', 'sorry', 'getting', 'worse', 'scene', 'next', 'classic', 'Johnny', 'predilection', 'nose', 'candy', 'other', 'performance', 'enhancing', 'substances', 'such', 'Viagra', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'always', 'rise', 'occasion', 'Sean', 'help', 'out', 'only', 'too', 'willing', 'oblige', 'Sean', 'then', 'hired', 'more', 'skills', 'continuity', 'department', 'opposed', 'arty', 'camera', 'shots.Johnny', 'pay', 'gay', 'girl', 'friend', 'shape', 'Roxanne', 'Day', 'Julie', 'Desponsio', 'aka', 'lap', 'dancer', 'club', 'where', 'Deborah', 'Harry', 'Madame', 'Whilst', 'Sean', 'time', 'packing', 'such', 'classic', 'titles', 'Iceman', 'Cometh', 'Tranny', 'Get', 'Gun', 'Johnny', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'unreliable', 'jeopardising', 'everything', 'studio', 'relationship', 'Julie', 'film', 'then', 'more', 'dark', 'nasty', 'world', 'leaving', 'humorous', 'asides', 'had', 'kept', 'interest', 'up', 'However', 'point', 'was', 'hooked', 'enough', 'stay', 'see', 'where', 'led', 'two', 'directors', 'Richard', 'Glatzer', 'Wash', 'Westmoreland', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'different', 'feels', 'still', 'together', 'quite', 'well.It', 'not', 'have', 'best', 'cinematography', 'ever', 'acting', 'not', 'always', 'top', 'notch', 'grower', 'be', 'last', 'pun', 'sense', 'kept', 'remembering', 'parts', 'have', 'recommended', 'friends', 'feature', 'real', 'porn', 'stars', 'too', 'could', 'tell', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'lot', 'heart', 'so', 'slightly', 'wall', 'comedic', 'tale', 'love', 'angst', 'betrayal', 'thing', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A
