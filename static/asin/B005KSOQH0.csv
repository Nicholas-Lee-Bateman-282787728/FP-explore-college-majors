Seasons 1 and 2 were the only ones that were released in the states so when I found this box set with all 5 seasons (even though season 5 was never dubbed) along with the 3 movies, I was beyond stoked.  When I got into season 3 I realized why they only released the 1st 2 in the States haha.",5,YAY,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,331,"['friends', 'grew', 'up', 'show', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'were', 'only', 'ones', 'were', 'released', 'states', 'when', 'found', 'box', 'set', '5', 'seasons', 'even', 'season', '5', 'was', 'never', 'dubbed', '3', 'movies', 'was', 'stoked', 'When', 'got', 'season', '3', 'realized', 'why', 'only', 'released', '1st', '2', 'States', 'haha']",N/A

Lol, no, I'm just kidding, but I don't see what's wrong with the English  dubbed version. it's what I grew up on.  I am such a big fan of Sailor Moon. She was like my inspiration to be more creatively. I've been watching this show ever since it came in 1995. This show is so unique and beautiful. It's not like other shows. It was better. MUCH BETTER. I've seen all of the seasons except Sailor Moon Stars. I like the English dubbed version. The undubbed version is just weird and confusing. The great thing about the show is that the characters reinvent themselves. Each season it appears to come up something different, and I like that. It would be nice to see the episodes of Sailor Moon again. That show was such an inspiration. It's brilliant! PURE BRILLIANT!!!!",5,I love Sailor Moon!

1464023,A3ROPC55BE2OM9,B005KSOQH0,WingLT,"[5, 14]",Just as the title says. I bought a set a few years ago from Animage. I found quickly found out that they copied the ADV Films sets and badly done. Several episodes were either cut off on the DVD's or missing. Subtitles were way off as well. Don't know how that was possible since they copied the official sets. It's not worth your money. Better off trying to find the original sets from ADV Films. This set needs to be taken down. This is partly the reason why the series hasn't had a re release because of all the bootleg copies on Amazon and other sites like E Bay and iOffer.,1,Bootleg!
