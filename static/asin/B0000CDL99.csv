This film stands on its own and transcends any genre.I won't detail the plot, because that has been very well covered by the other reviewers on this page. But I will say that ""My Life on Ice"" has tremendous beauty and emotional resonance. It feels so real, you'll have a hard time believing at the end that it was fully scripted and these are actors.It reminded me of the work of Eric Rohmer, who is similarly able to extract life truths from naturalistic performances and a real-time directorial style. It also shares other qualities often present in his films: charm, sweetness, tremendous affection for the characters (even when self-deluded), and a believable happy ending.Those who are only satisfied by U.S. movies that spell out every detail while not allowing for subtlety or ambiguity will  be greatly annoyed by this movie. Those who expect titillation (often a side product of this genre) will also be disappointed.But for those -- you know who you are -- who prize foreign films that best capture the intricacies of life, this is a must buy.",5,Not your typical coming-of-age film,1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,1206,"['was', 'bit', 'wary', 'seeing', 'movie', 'go', 'way', 'avoid', 'latest', 'entries', 'gay-themed', 'coming-of-age', 'genre', 'came', 'away', 'astonished', 'film', 'own', 'genre.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'detail', 'plot', 'been', 'very', 'well', 'covered', 'other', 'reviewers', 'page', 'will', 'say', 'Life', 'Ice', 'tremendous', 'beauty', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'so', 'real', ""'ll"", 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'end', 'was', 'fully', 'scripted', 'are', 'actors.It', 'reminded', 'work', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'who', 'similarly', 'able', 'extract', 'life', 'truths', 'naturalistic', 'performances', 'real-time', 'directorial', 'style', 'also', 'shares', 'other', 'qualities', 'often', 'present', 'films', 'charm', 'sweetness', 'tremendous', 'affection', 'characters', 'even', 'when', 'self-deluded', 'believable', 'happy', 'ending.Those', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'satisfied', 'U.S.', 'movies', 'spell', 'out', 'detail', 'not', 'allowing', 'subtlety', 'ambiguity', 'will', 'be', 'greatly', 'annoyed', 'movie', 'who', 'expect', 'titillation', 'often', 'side', 'product', 'genre', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'disappointed.But', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'prize', 'foreign', 'films', 'best', 'capture', 'intricacies', 'life', 'must', 'buy']",N/A

Etienne, a graceful competitive ice skater, receives a hand held video camera for his 16th birthday and begins a year long video diary. The wonderful twist on this plot devise is that the viewer  now gets to see everthing that catches Etienne's eye, including passages of young working class laborers and firemen hunks. We see Etienne become obsessed with his handsome geography teacher whom he stalks and films. When Etienne is caught filming his teacher in class, a discussion between Laurent his teacher and his mother initiates a new love affair between the two. Of course this allows even more opportunities for Etienne to film and observe Laurent.Etienne's best friend is handsome Ludovic who moves from virgin to young Don Juan. Etienne shows no interest in girls but rather follows Ludovic around filming him dancing with, kissing, and eventually making love to young women.Etienne's innocence is charming and childlike. He films the other skaters in the dressing room and eventually is confronted by both Ludovic and Laurent regarding his filming. It is Laurent who confronts Etienne that his filming indicates he is attracted to men.The video diary approach to this film was very fresh and clever with Etienne and Ludovic playing many games while filmaking.The acting of all the characters was superb. Etienne's charming, beautiful, athletic mother was perfect for a young bright skater. His grandmother was charming. The handsome actors that played Ludovic and Laurent both perfect for their roles.  The city of Rouen and the Normandy coast were a great setting and the film convinced you of setting and place.Finally, several reviewers were concerned with the somewhat abrupt ending of the film. Etienne finally goes to bed with a young fellow and the film ends with them playing with the camera in bed filming each other after love making. I had no problem with this ending at all. After a year of struggling with obsession for his teacher and best friend, Etienne finds a young man with similar sexual orientation and the pieces begin to fall into place. Young gay men become obsessed with the handsome heterosexual males in their lives until they learn to focus this attention on men with their same sexual orientation, or at least the ones who want to minimize their frustration soon learn to focus. I felt that film ended with Etienne reaching this point in his life and the filmakers certainly took us on a delightful journey to reach this point.",5,Unique and delightful coming out story,1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,2589,"['French', 'film', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'process', 'coming', 'out', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'clever', 'insightful', 'manner', 'Etienne', 'graceful', 'competitive', 'ice', 'skater', 'hand', 'held', 'video', 'camera', '16th', 'birthday', 'year', 'long', 'video', 'diary', 'wonderful', 'twist', 'plot', 'devise', 'viewer', 'now', 'see', 'everthing', 'Etienne', 'eye', 'including', 'passages', 'young', 'working', 'class', 'laborers', 'firemen', 'hunks', 'see', 'Etienne', 'become', 'obsessed', 'handsome', 'geography', 'teacher', 'whom', 'films', 'When', 'Etienne', 'caught', 'filming', 'teacher', 'class', 'discussion', 'Laurent', 'teacher', 'mother', 'new', 'love', 'affair', 'two', 'course', 'even', 'more', 'opportunities', 'Etienne', 'film', 'observe', 'Laurent.Etienne', 'best', 'friend', 'handsome', 'Ludovic', 'who', 'virgin', 'young', 'Don', 'Juan', 'Etienne', 'interest', 'girls', 'rather', 'Ludovic', 'filming', 'dancing', 'kissing', 'eventually', 'making', 'love', 'young', 'women.Etienne', 'innocence', 'charming', 'childlike', 'films', 'other', 'skaters', 'dressing', 'room', 'eventually', 'confronted', 'Ludovic', 'Laurent', 'regarding', 'filming', 'Laurent', 'who', 'Etienne', 'filming', 'attracted', 'men.The', 'video', 'diary', 'approach', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'fresh', 'clever', 'Etienne', 'Ludovic', 'playing', 'many', 'games', 'filmaking.The', 'acting', 'characters', 'was', 'superb', 'Etienne', 'charming', 'beautiful', 'athletic', 'mother', 'was', 'perfect', 'young', 'bright', 'skater', 'grandmother', 'was', 'charming', 'handsome', 'actors', 'played', 'Ludovic', 'Laurent', 'perfect', 'roles', 'city', 'Rouen', 'Normandy', 'coast', 'were', 'great', 'setting', 'film', 'convinced', 'setting', 'place.Finally', 'several', 'reviewers', 'were', 'concerned', 'somewhat', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'film', 'Etienne', 'finally', 'bed', 'young', 'fellow', 'film', 'playing', 'camera', 'bed', 'filming', 'other', 'making', 'had', 'problem', 'ending', 'year', 'struggling', 'obsession', 'teacher', 'best', 'friend', 'Etienne', 'young', 'man', 'similar', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'pieces', 'begin', 'fall', 'place', 'Young', 'gay', 'men', 'become', 'obsessed', 'handsome', 'heterosexual', 'males', 'lives', 'learn', 'focus', 'attention', 'men', 'same', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'least', 'ones', 'who', 'want', 'minimize', 'frustration', 'soon', 'learn', 'focus', 'felt', 'film', 'ended', 'Etienne', 'reaching', 'point', 'life', 'filmakers', 'certainly', 'took', 'delightful', 'journey', 'reach', 'point']",N/A

Like their previous film The Adventures of Felix, the main character, Etienne, is on a journey.When he receives a video camera for his birthday, Etiennce begins relentlessly filming the people and events in his life...his mother, grandmother, best friend Ludovic, and his teacher Laurent.What starts as a way for him to chronicle the coming year of his life (a year, he tells Ludovic, that he will find love), becomes a discovery for both the viewer and Etienne himself. We learn as much about him from the events of his life as we do about the subjects his camera lovingly captures. Is there a reason most of his subjects are men?To try and explain the plot of this movie, if there really is one, is to not do it justice. The movie is shot entirely through the lens of Etienne's camera, but never seems gimicky, forced, or unbelievable. We are part of his life, and because of this, we take an interest in Etienne's ultimate discovery about himself.The fact that Etienne is a figure skater (actor Jimmy Taveres is himself an accomplished skater) plays prominently in the movie. His goals for the year ahead are to win a figure skating competiton, find happiness, and find true love, although not necessarily in that order.How, or even if, he reaches these goals is the real treat of this charming movie, filled with appealing, believable characters.",4,Self Discovery Through  A Camera,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,1496,"['More', 'film', 'self', 'discovery', 'coming', 'out', 'My', 'Life', 'Ice', 'third', 'film', 'directors/writers', 'Olivier', 'Ducastel', 'Jacques', 'Martineau', 'previous', 'film', 'Adventures', 'Felix', 'main', 'character', 'Etienne', 'journey.When', 'video', 'camera', 'birthday', 'Etiennce', 'relentlessly', 'filming', 'people', 'events', 'life', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'best', 'friend', 'Ludovic', 'teacher', 'Laurent.What', 'way', 'chronicle', 'coming', 'year', 'life', 'year', 'Ludovic', 'will', 'find', 'love', 'discovery', 'viewer', 'Etienne', 'learn', 'as', 'much', 'events', 'life', 'do', 'subjects', 'camera', 'lovingly', 'captures', 'there', 'reason', 'most', 'subjects', 'are', 'men', 'try', 'explain', 'plot', 'movie', 'really', 'one', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'movie', 'shot', 'entirely', 'lens', 'Etienne', 'camera', 'never', 'gimicky', 'forced', 'unbelievable', 'are', 'part', 'life', 'take', 'interest', 'Etienne', 'ultimate', 'discovery', 'himself.The', 'fact', 'Etienne', 'figure', 'skater', 'actor', 'Jimmy', 'Taveres', 'accomplished', 'skater', 'prominently', 'movie', 'goals', 'year', 'ahead', 'are', 'win', 'figure', 'skating', 'competiton', 'find', 'happiness', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'not', 'necessarily', 'order.How', 'even', 'goals', 'real', 'treat', 'charming', 'movie', 'filled', 'appealing', 'believable', 'characters']",N/A

775557,A1J39MAMRGHZ5Y,B0000CDL99,"giovannif7 ""giovannif7""","[12, 14]","This leisurely paced mock documentary from France utilizes an interesting convention to explore the life of a young figure skater.  The story begins as Etienne receives a video camera for his sixteenth birthday, and begins using it to chronicle the people and events in his life.  The story is told entirely through the perspective of Etienne's camera lens, which sounds like a convention that could quickly grow tiresome, but actually adds a great deal to the development of the story.  Tentative at first, Etienne's camerawork develops and grows more assured throughout the film, in some ways mirroring Etienne's interests and personal development. Etienne's initial subjects are random faces and scenes from his family, friends and day-to day life.  Slowly, the subjects of Etienne's interests become less random, and as he begins to sharpen his focus, the path of his personal journey is made clear.  An obsession with a teacher, sexually-oriented conversations with his best friend, and attempts at capturing people in various states of undress - all normal curiosities which help shed light upon Etienne's internal questioning.  Some uncomfortable moments of confrontation lead to a dramatic crossroads, but the filmmaker and the audience have enough knowledge and feeling about Etienne to know that he will find the right path for himself.This is not a film that everyone will enjoy.  Those with Attention Deficit Disorder, or who lose interest in a movie if something isn't blowing up every few minutes will most likely find themselves quickly bored.  Patient viewers who are willing to watch the puzzle pieces fall into place, however, will find great rewards in this satisfying slice of life exploration.

As the movie unfolds, we see where it is going. Etienne's longing, as he photographs firemen, construction workers and other anonymous men from a distance, is palpable.There is some beautiful camera work here, a bit of humor-- Etienne has his mother blow out her birthday candles three times before he gets the footage he wants-- and an understated ending that is worth the wait.",4,This Little Film Grows On You,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,1015,"['Etienne', 'Jimmy', 'Tavares', 'sixteen', 'digital', 'camera', 'filming', 'everything', 'everyone', 'film', 'camera', 'thought', 'Not', 'lackluster', 'French', 'coming-out', 'story', 'movie', 'lot', 'better', 'are', 'believe', 'Etienne', 'gains', 'more', 'skill', 'use', 'camera', 'particularly', 'when', 'remote', 'well', 'worth', 'watching.Etienne', 'figure', 'skater', 'shoots', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'friend', 'Ludovic', 'whom', 'secret', 'crush', 'geography', 'teacher', 'Laurent', 'whom', 'also', 'who', 'eventually', 'up', 'Etienne', 'mother', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'Etienne', 'longing', 'firemen', 'construction', 'workers', 'other', 'anonymous', 'men', 'distance', 'palpable.There', 'beautiful', 'camera', 'work', 'here', 'bit', 'humor', 'Etienne', 'mother', 'blow', 'birthday', 'three', 'times', 'footage', 'understated', 'ending', 'wait']",N/A
775559,A1X1RWRPSAL206,B0000CDL99,"interested_observer ""interested_observer""","[23, 24]","""My Life on Ice"" (Ma vraie vie a Rouen) shows how a 16-year old French student and figure skater uses a gift digital camera to explore his world and his relationships, allowing him to make some decisions and forays.Etienne (played by Jimmy Tavares) gets along very well with his widowed mother, Caroline (played by Ariane Ascaride) and his step-father's mother, Granma (played by Helene Surgere).  When Granma wins a digital camera in a lottery, she passes it on to Etienne at the start of the movie.Etienne figures the camera out immediately and takes pictures of what matters most to him - his mother and grandmother, his skating, his best friend, Ludovic (played by Lucas Bonnifait), his geography teacher, Laurent (played by Jonathan Zaccai), and his skating partner (played by Nicolas Pontois).  The picture recording becomes obsessive.  Etienne tries to keep the proceedings fun and natural but is able to take advantage of Ludovic's vanity to have him answer questions on the sex he has when dating girls.  Eventually Etienne's movie stars ask him to leave them more of their privacy.Early on Ludovic hears Etienne's proclamation that the coming school year is the Year of Love, when he will fall in love and have sex.  Well, maybe he will have to compete first in the French ice skating championships (in which he comes in second).  Later on Ludovic remembers and suggests that Etienne get a move on in courting the ladies.Etienne does finagle an early meeting between his mother and the geography teacher, who hit it off and become a couple.  Laurent makes an easy-going father-figure, but what does Etienne really think of that, especially since Laurent has been making observations of his own.After Laurent has an accident, Etienne asks Ludovic a dangerous, leading question, triggering a logical next step and leading to a happy, unexpected conclusion.Etienne is not a trained photographer; so the picture shown has technically poor editing, lighting, and composition from time to time.  The quality picks up as Etienne improves and uses a remote control.  The movie's makers do produce order from the quasi-amateur efforts; so it's all right.While Etienne is a friendly, endearing fellow, he does not verbalize his inner self.  He uses his camera to explore his interests and draws his own conclusions.  Unlike what traditionally happens in this type of movie, there are no soliloquies, journals, class essays, or sobbing to sympathetic female classmates or family members.  Etienne is following a normal coming-out process, but relying on an unusual prop.  He does push his luck.  The is curious and exploring. The audience has to work a little bit.The ending was abrupt, elliptic, and happy.  Maybe there could be a sequel?While Etienne takes some skin shots of his skating partner, of Ludovic (thrice), and of Laurent, the main character goes the distance himself more than once, earning extra points for looks and bravery.All the main actors are good.  Jimmy Tavares and Nicolas Pontois do their own expert figure skating.  The sets and Normandy locations (Rouen, Dieppe, the coast) are attractive.  It was nice to have a cameo from Frederic Gorny of ""Wild Reeds.""The extras include a very good commentary from the two directors (Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau, who also did ""The Adventures of Felix""), a trailer, and previews of three other movies.",4,"Smile for the Camera!

775560,A14JEURPY1CXZB,B0000CDL99,James D. Leverton,"[17, 21]","""My Life on Ice"" (2003) is a small gem of a film and the best kind of surprise--an intriguing, experimental French import released directly to DVD which offers more charm, wit, warmth and wisdom than 99% of today's Hollywood offerings.French directors Jacques Martineau and Olivier Ducastle have fashioned their film as a video diary, filmed by young Etienne as he enters his seventeenth year.  After receiving a video camera from his grandmother, he immediately begins constantly filming his mother, her boyfriend, his friends, and even himself in the year he dubs ""the year of love"", vowing to find love before his seventeenth birthday.  As the year progresses, we learn much about Etienne mainly through what he chooses to film.  It isn't long before it becomes apparent that Etienne, who is an extremely good-looking young man, has no interest whatsoever in girls, but plenty of interest in his hunky best friend and his mother's new boyfriend, who is also his teacher.  What follows is a wonderful and realistic variation on a stale cinematic convention:  the gay coming-of-age story.One of the reasons ""My Life on Ice"" works so well is that the directors have actually filmed this story over a year's time, so we actually watch Etienne grow through the course of the film, much as he would in real life.  Also, Etienne is a figure skater, played by an actor (Jimmy Tavares) who is a talented figure skater in real life, which adds to the realism.  Also, they have their lead actor do as much of the filming as possible with the hand-held camera and have framed the picture so the audience appears to be watching home movies.  This is one cinematic experiment that works extremely well.As Etienne, Tavares is wonderfully natural and an appealing subject.  Actually, the entire cast is pitch-perfect, as they begin the film extremely camera-conscious and then gradually get more comfortable until it appears they have almost forgotten the camera is there at all.  And all the emotions of being filmed are there--the initial reluctance, the annoyance, the tantrums, the amusement.  In all, Martineau and Ducastle hit the bullseye with this little delight.My only problem is with the ending, which seems a bit abrupt, especially considering all that Etienne has gone through emotionally.  My guess is many gay viewers will also be somewhat disappointed that the directors choose to end the film at the precise moment they do.  Otherwise, this film works on every level.An added treat on this DVD is the commentary (in English) by the co-directors, who are lovers in real life.  Although they sometimes struggle with their English, they offer much insight into their filming techniques and why they chose to film over a year's time.  Also, they are obviously enamored of their (very) young star, who they nearly swoon over at times, which is quite endearing to listen to.

He starts to film events in Rouen, his entourage, and so we, through him, see his ""real life"" through the distilling lens of a camera.Etienne begins by filming his mother (wonderfully acted by Ariane Ascaride), grandmother, and others, in particular his best friend Ludovic, his secret love interest.He films incessantly: Laurent, his geography teacher, who eventually gets together with his mother, but to whom Etienne also finds himself attracted; his ice skating friends, (also secretly in the cloakrooms while they undress); even himself. But in all this he prefers being behind the camera, choosing to reveal all of himself through his voyage of discovery.Choosing to make a film about the life of a gay teenager, Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau (who also made ""Jeanne et le garon formidable"" and the wonderfully refreshing ""Drle de Felix) decided to film digitally, putting the camera at the heart of the story as a character in its own right. This gives the film its great personal attraction. We are all peeping Toms through the eyes of Etienne.The original method of narration thus employed has its advantages, and some defects. Having Etienne hold the camera allows a cunning freshness and a naivety, but like anybody with a new toy, he films anything and everything, not always worrying about how interesting we may find what he's recording. But that's part of the Gallic charm...""Ma vrai vie a Rouen"" is a cinematographic experiment in self-discovery; a story in which many will find a piece of themselves. Both, modest and touching, the film manages to show us where his and our desire hides - something his friends and relatives have so much difficulty seeing - finding a real life of love that fulfills desires.In its simplicity of story telling and the pursuit of love this film reminds also of Yossi and Jagger.Very recommendable.",5,My real life,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,1917,"['Etienne', 'Jimmy', 'Tavares', 'given', 'digital', 'camera', '16th', 'film', 'events', 'Rouen', 'entourage', 'so', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'distilling', 'lens', 'camera.Etienne', 'filming', 'mother', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'Ariane', 'Ascaride', 'grandmother', 'others', 'particular', 'best', 'friend', 'Ludovic', 'secret', 'love', 'interest.He', 'films', 'incessantly', 'Laurent', 'geography', 'teacher', 'who', 'eventually', 'together', 'mother', 'whom', 'Etienne', 'also', 'attracted', 'ice', 'skating', 'friends', 'also', 'secretly', 'cloakrooms', 'undress', 'even', 'being', 'camera', 'choosing', 'reveal', 'voyage', 'discovery.Choosing', 'make', 'film', 'life', 'gay', 'teenager', 'Olivier', 'Ducastel', 'Jacques', 'Martineau', 'who', 'also', 'made', 'Jeanne', 'le', 'garon', 'formidable', 'wonderfully', 'refreshing', 'Drle', 'de', 'Felix', 'decided', 'film', 'digitally', 'putting', 'camera', 'heart', 'story', 'character', 'own', 'right', 'film', 'great', 'personal', 'attraction', 'are', 'peeping', 'Toms', 'eyes', 'Etienne.The', 'original', 'method', 'narration', 'thus', 'employed', 'advantages', 'defects', 'Having', 'Etienne', 'hold', 'camera', 'cunning', 'freshness', 'naivety', 'anybody', 'new', 'toy', 'films', 'anything', 'everything', 'not', 'always', 'worrying', 'how', 'interesting', 'may', 'find', 'what', 'recording', 'part', 'Gallic', 'charm', 'Ma', 'vrai', 'vie', 'Rouen', 'cinematographic', 'experiment', 'self-discovery', 'story', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'piece', 'modest', 'touching', 'film', 'show', 'where', 'desire', 'something', 'friends', 'relatives', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'difficulty', 'seeing', 'finding', 'real', 'life', 'love', 'simplicity', 'story', 'telling', 'pursuit', 'love', 'film', 'also', 'Yossi', 'Jagger.Very', 'recommendable']",N/A

775564,A14794N044AML4,B0000CDL99,"Rolando A. Perez ""RAP""","[1, 2]","Ma vraie vie a Rouen (My Life on Ice) is an interesting and unusual coming of age movie. All coming of age movies follow a certain pattern with specific elements to it. The cute boys, usually buddies or best friends; maybe one of the boy has a crush on the other; the combination of gay and straight in the boys or both gay; the torture, confusion, and struggle for the gay boy to accept and for others to accept him. The disillusion of family members once the boy comes out. Movies like ""Beautiful Thing"", ""Get Real"", and ""Summer Storm"" are some of the better type of this genre. All actors, generally, are straight, usually, extremely handsome, some fitting the age of the characters, other a lot older. Most disappear from the screen after making the one movie (I do not know whether that is by choice or whether they have been labeled).My Life on Ice possess some of those attributes. Etienne, played by French Champion Ice Skater Jimmy Tavares (no doubles for him, he performs all the ice skating scenes), is an extremely cute high school kid. Etienne lives with his mother (there is no mention of a real father but a step-father who died). His paternal grandmother gives him a video camera which she wins with a scratching ticket. And the plot begins.From the moment the movie starts, we are watching it through the eyes of a camera. He starts filming his mother every move, next his buddy, then himself ice skating, trips. All of the filming is very much innocent. What a young boy will do with a new toy. Things start to change when he films his buddy close up, making him nervous. He becomes obsessed with a school geography teacher (who becomes his mother's boyfriend later in the movie and possibly a step-father, but the movie doesn't go that far), filming his every move, almost stalking him. You start to figure out that things are not what they seem to.Filming gets real serious when he starts filming himself naked and totally undresses himself in front of his ice skating friend in the locker room. The obsessed attraction with an older man, filming his every move, tells what this kid's inner feelings are. He is constantly avoiding requests from his best friend to go out and meet girls or have sex with  them. The film comes to an end by Etienne telling his best friend that he is gay in a very indirectly way, ""can you love a boy?."" Ludovic (his buddy), played by Lucas Bonnifait, simply gets up and leaves not wanting to hear any more (apparently they are at a ocean summer vacation resort, which keeps re-appearing throughout the movie with Etienne's mother and her boyfriend, and his grandmother). The movie ends with what looks like an attempt to suicide by jumping off a cliff (which he has an obsession whenever he is in this area throughout the movie)while taping with his camera. A total stranger passes by and realizes what is going out. Conveniently he is gay, older, and has sex with Etienne (finally loosing his virginity as he promised to his buddy at the beginning of the movie). Another reviewer stated that it was a rather superficial ending. True, but the radiant smile of Etienne's face tells it all.My Life on Ice story is a smart story. All other movies use traditional methods to tell the plot. This movie uses a video camera, and through this camera, the personality of a troubled gay kid surfaces. In the movie people will conclude that Etienne is a strong healthy competitive boy, with his ice skating and championship, everybody will think that there is nothing wrong. But ice skating is just a cover up. The movie does have a happy end. But like other movies of this type we would like how the protagonist fairs afterwards.",4,Unusual,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,3670,"['Ma', 'vraie', 'vie', 'Rouen', 'My', 'Life', 'Ice', 'interesting', 'unusual', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'coming', 'age', 'movies', 'follow', 'certain', 'pattern', 'specific', 'elements', 'cute', 'boys', 'usually', 'best', 'friends', 'maybe', 'one', 'boy', 'crush', 'other', 'combination', 'gay', 'straight', 'boys', 'gay', 'torture', 'confusion', 'struggle', 'gay', 'boy', 'accept', 'others', 'accept', 'disillusion', 'family', 'members', 'once', 'boy', 'out', 'Movies', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'Get', 'Real', 'Summer', 'Storm', 'are', 'better', 'type', 'genre', 'actors', 'generally', 'are', 'straight', 'usually', 'extremely', 'handsome', 'fitting', 'age', 'characters', 'other', 'lot', 'older', 'Most', 'disappear', 'screen', 'making', 'one', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'choice', 'have', 'been', 'labeled', '.My', 'Life', 'Ice', 'attributes', 'Etienne', 'played', 'French', 'Champion', 'Ice', 'Skater', 'Jimmy', 'Tavares', 'doubles', 'ice', 'skating', 'scenes', 'extremely', 'cute', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'Etienne', 'mother', 'mention', 'real', 'father', 'step-father', 'who', 'died', 'paternal', 'grandmother', 'video', 'camera', 'scratching', 'ticket', 'plot', 'moment', 'movie', 'are', 'watching', 'eyes', 'camera', 'filming', 'mother', 'move', 'buddy', 'then', 'ice', 'skating', 'trips', 'filming', 'very', 'much', 'innocent', 'What', 'young', 'boy', 'will', 'do', 'new', 'toy', 'Things', 'start', 'change', 'when', 'films', 'buddy', 'close', 'making', 'nervous', 'obsessed', 'school', 'geography', 'teacher', 'who', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'later', 'movie', 'possibly', 'step-father', 'movie', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'filming', 'move', 'almost', 'stalking', 'start', 'figure', 'out', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'to.Filming', 'real', 'serious', 'when', 'filming', 'naked', 'totally', 'undresses', 'front', 'ice', 'skating', 'friend', 'locker', 'room', 'obsessed', 'attraction', 'older', 'man', 'filming', 'move', 'what', 'kid', 'inner', 'feelings', 'are', 'constantly', 'avoiding', 'requests', 'best', 'friend', 'go', 'out', 'meet', 'girls', 'have', 'sex', 'film', 'end', 'Etienne', 'telling', 'best', 'friend', 'gay', 'very', 'indirectly', 'way', 'can', 'love', 'boy', 'Ludovic', 'buddy', 'played', 'Lucas', 'Bonnifait', 'simply', 'up', 'not', 'wanting', 'hear', 'more', 'apparently', 'are', 'ocean', 'summer', 'vacation', 'resort', 're-appearing', 'movie', 'Etienne', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'grandmother', 'movie', 'what', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'jumping', 'off', 'cliff', 'obsession', 'whenever', 'area', 'movie', 'taping', 'camera', 'total', 'stranger', 'passes', 'realizes', 'what', 'going', 'out', 'Conveniently', 'gay', 'older', 'sex', 'Etienne', 'finally', 'loosing', 'virginity', 'promised', 'buddy', 'beginning', 'movie', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'was', 'rather', 'superficial', 'ending', 'True', 'radiant', 'smile', 'Etienne', 'face', 'all.My', 'Life', 'Ice', 'story', 'smart', 'story', 'other', 'movies', 'use', 'traditional', 'methods', 'tell', 'plot', 'movie', 'video', 'camera', 'camera', 'personality', 'troubled', 'gay', 'kid', 'surfaces', 'movie', 'people', 'will', 'conclude', 'Etienne', 'strong', 'healthy', 'competitive', 'boy', 'ice', 'skating', 'championship', 'everybody', 'will', 'think', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'ice', 'skating', 'just', 'cover', 'up', 'movie', 'have', 'happy', 'end', 'other', 'movies', 'type', 'would', 'like', 'how', 'protagonist', 'fairs', 'afterwards']",N/A
