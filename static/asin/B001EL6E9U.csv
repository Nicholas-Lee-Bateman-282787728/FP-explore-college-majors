1185954,A398SM0LR6KLZO,B001EL6E9U,Aion,"[6, 7]","My-HiME fits the description of 'beautiful trainwreck' better than any other anime I've watched. It starts out as a high school slice-of-life series, with a lot of ecchi humour, even the 'monster of the week' battles providing far more in the way of amusement (a panty/bra stealing creature, for example) than danger. Then, in the last twelve episodes or so, the drama side gets going, which results in it turning into a less gruesome version of Battle Royale, with robots added on top. The two differing sections of the story do end up blending well together - the first part providing time for viewers to become attached to the characters - but it was certainly strange to see a light-hearted anime take such a dark turn...If nothing else, you have to praise the visual and audio aspects of the series. It has lovely art and very good animation, the character designs (the faces, short skirts, big breasts and super model female cast) and bright colours unsurprisingly reminding me of Code Geass. The soundtrack is mostly stellar, too, with the music Goddess known as Yuki Kajiura pulling out one of her overall weaker (compared to her best work) but by no means poor collections of music. Even the English voice acting impressed me, Mai's voice fitting her fiery yet loveable and cute personality like a glove... However, where My-HiME falls short, and what makes me class it as a trainwreck, is its story.Put simply, the story is about a group of twelve girls and their loved ones. Each of the twelve girls (referred to as 'HiME') has a different power, some being elemental and others being the ability to use weapons, and each can summon a mecha/monster (referred to as a 'Child' if it obeys a human and an 'Orphan' if it doesn't) to fight with them. Mai, the female lead, moves to the prestigious Fuka Academy (which accommodates elementary-high school ages, and has dormitories for both genders), along with her younger brother at the start, and there she meets and interacts with the other girls with powers and her new classmates.Sadly, there isn't much actual plot covered in the 26 episodes. The first half focuses heavily on characterization, fan service and comical goings on. The second half focuses on characterization and battles, each battle resulting in a new death. In between all of this, not a lot beyond the basic premise of the story gets a look in. This resulted in very little of the plot making sense, and the final episode was a failure (partly) because of this.Why were the 'Child' and 'Orphan' creatures in existence? How could they be summoned by certain people? What was the character reminiscent of Kaoru from Evangelion (Naji)? Why did the HiME ritual occur every 300 years?None of the above questions, or numerous others I have, receive answers within the series. When the final episode rolled around and the world was saved from destruction in predictable fashion, I was left with a blank expression on my face, reflecting on the many questions without answers and with disappointment in the place of the answers I desired.Apart from its production values, what saved My-HiME, for me at least, was the quality of its characterization. Over the course of the series, you learn all about Mai. Her relationship with her brother is explored and plays a major role, and as a result of an involving love quadruple I came to care about her as a person, as well as her likeable main love interest. And, though the other cast members didn't get anywhere near as much time because of the amount of them - the number reminding me of Negima's never-ending character list to begin with - enough of the personalities and back-stories of those that mattered got covered for me to become emotionally involved with many of them. The characters laughed and cried, and I was able to feel their emotions; never feeling disconnected.But, switching back to the story, the final episode almost ruined the good that came before. If you're the sort of person that cringes when you see deus ex machina twists, your face won't be a pretty sight after finishing the anime because it's practically non-stop deus ex machina in the last episode. Without wanting to spoil too much, what happened at the end of My-HiME is equivalent to every emotional, heart-wrenching moment of a story being made worthless, destroying any attachment one has to the many moving scenes included. Even though I enjoyed what came before immensely, I felt like time slowed down at the end - it was a sad way to end such an absorbing title.To sum it up, Sunrise know how to please anime fans; men/otaku in particular. They keep the skirts high, the chests large, the comedy amusing and are masters at pulling away at the heart strings of viewers with dramatic action, or just plain old fashioned drama. They know how to make up for what would normally by anime ruining flaws. If not for the poor excuse of a story and even worse attempt at an ending, if only for enjoyment alone, I'd be rating it higher, but it wasn't to be. Instead, I'll give it a solid 8/10, thinking of it as something of a guilty pleasure.",4,Beautiful Trainwreck,1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,5093,"['My-HiME', 'description', ""'beautiful"",

I really like that despite that, during episodes lacking in action it's clear there's some action going on. It gives the feeling the monster-of-the-week type critters have more presence.There's also much amusing humor although when the story gets more serious the dramatic parts are still interesting because the series develops the characters a lot & the audience can really invest in these people.

1185957,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B001EL6E9U,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[1, 1]","Perhaps it's a little much to take in all at once, but My-Hime might be the coolest anime I've ever seen.The series can certainly be criticized for dawdling too much with pointless side-quests and general goofiness. However, My-Hime's girls might be the stars of the show.Each character possesses a special HIME power and a Child, a special robot, to protect themselves. Mai Tohika, the main character, uses it to defend her high school friends at Fuka Academy. She eventually teams up with Natsuki and Mikoto, a third-year student. They first fight Orphans, the monsters who attack the school.However, as the story moves on, Mai and Natsuki discover the secrets of the First District Organization. Many of their goals remain a mystery, but they seem intent on reviving the Obsidian Prince. But the true gut punch comes when the HIMEs discover that if their Child dies, they risk losing something they love.While it is very hard to explain the series without giving away the story, there is plenty of heartbreak in the series. Don't worry--everything gets wrapped up nicely. However, the series dwells on the dread of loss, of missing what they truely love.And often, the characters have very little control over their emotions, making for some incredible fights with spinning giant swords, bows, spears and guns. True, all the characters end up emotionally exhausted, but Mai is probably one of the best female heroes, who manages to keep moving on, in spite of the deaths of many of her friends.This series could easily be compared to Trigun, which featured just as much heartbreak. However, My-Hime also manages to soup up everything with bass-thumping techno music and some of the coolest fight scenes, with ships cut in half and plenty of big, big explosions. And at the same time, the characters are deeply intent on not fighting.After a certain point, the entire school turns into a wasteland. The HIMEs' obsession with the people they love grows so overwhelming that they blow up nearly everything in sight. My-HIME makes for a great anime to watch after breaking up with a girlfriend or boyfriend. In fact, it's so good that it's my favorite anime to watch.I just can't wait to watch the sequel series, My-Otome and My-Zhime.",5,Fighting for love and peace,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,2234,"['Perhaps', 'little', 'much', 'take', 'once', 'My-Hime', 'might', 'be', 'coolest', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.The', 'series', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'criticized', 'dawdling', 'too', 'much', 'pointless', 'side-quests', 'general', 'goofiness', 'However', 'My-Hime', 'girls', 'might', 'be', 'stars', 'show.Each', 'character', 'special', 'HIME', 'power', 'Child', 'special', 'robot', 'protect', 'Mai', 'Tohika', 'main', 'character', 'defend', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'Fuka', 'Academy', 'eventually', 'teams', 'up', 'Natsuki', 'Mikoto', 'third-year', 'student', 'first', 'fight', 'Orphans', 'monsters', 'who', 'attack', 'school.However', 'story', 'moves', 'Mai', 'Natsuki', 'discover', 'secrets', 'First', 'District', 'Organization', 'Many', 'goals', 'remain', 'mystery', 'seem', 'intent', 'reviving', 'Obsidian', 'Prince', 'true', 'gut', 'punch', 'when', 'HIMEs', 'discover', 'Child', 'dies', 'risk', 'losing', 'something', 'love.While', 'very', 'hard', 'explain', 'series', 'giving', 'away', 'story', 'plenty', 'heartbreak', 'series', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nicely', 'However', 'series', 'dread', 'loss', 'missing', 'what', 'truely', 'love.And', 'often', 'characters', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'control', 'emotions', 'making', 'incredible', 'fights', 'spinning', 'giant', 'swords', 'bows', 'spears', 'guns', 'True', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'emotionally', 'exhausted', 'Mai', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'female', 'heroes', 'who', 'keep', 'moving', 'spite', 'deaths', 'many', 'friends.This', 'series', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'compared', 'Trigun', 'featured', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'heartbreak', 'However', 'My-Hime', 'also', 'soup', 'up', 'everything', 'bass-thumping', 'techno', 'music', 'coolest', 'fight', 'scenes', 'ships', 'cut', 'half', 'plenty', 'big', 'big', 'explosions', 'same', 'time', 'characters', 'are', 'deeply', 'intent', 'not', 'fighting.After', 'certain', 'point', 'entire', 'school', 'wasteland', 'HIMEs', 'obsession', 'people', 'love', 'grows', 'so', 'overwhelming', 'blow', 'up', 'nearly', 'everything', 'sight', 'My-HIME', 'great', 'anime', 'watch', 'breaking', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'boyfriend', 'fact', 'so', 'good', 'favorite', 'anime', 'watch.I', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'sequel', 'series', 'My-Otome', 'My-Zhime']",My-Hime: Complete Collection
1185958,AFV2584U13XP3,B001EL6E9U,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[2, 3]","I saw a few episodes on t.v. and decided to try this series out for the price it was going for and have not regretted it since.  The storyline mostly revolves around twelve girls in a private school who secretly have supernatural powers which enable them to produce unique weapons and fighting mechanical machines or animals each which is unique for each girl.  But there is a cost which is if the girls machines or animals their connected with is destroyed and with that their powers the girls will loose that which is most precious to them.  For the series it seemed to focus mostly on the character of Mai Tokiha one of the twelve girls who are called HIME and the4 job of the Himes is to battle demons from another dimension called ORPHANS who in the series mostly seem to attack the private school which the himes attend.  Of course you'll also have a group at the school who has a different agenda on how the himes should use their powers and the mysterious leader who's controlling the orphans for his/her own agenda.  The series also has the teenage angst of romance and comedy which are hilarious in some episodes but the series mostly keeps on track with the main storyline.  So if you like action, humorous, angst, and romantic animes this one is for your collection....I do want to clarify something I saw on a review about this series.  this series in noway has any same-sex adult scenes I saw a review a while back on this series and I just found that so absurd and idiotic.  Yes there are about four of the female cast characters who have personal feelings for another character female that seem to be romantic feeling between them but it noway goes beyond words and with one female couple a kiss but nothing past that stage.  The series tires to keep the focus about the Himes, what and who they truly wish to protect,  and what the ultimate agenda for the Himes truly is.",5,A Surprising Anime Both Exciting And Entertaining,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,1888,"['saw', 'few', 'episodes', 't.v', 'decided', 'try', 'series', 'price', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'not', 'regretted', 'storyline', 'mostly', 'around', 'twelve', 'girls', 'private', 'school', 'who', 'secretly', 'have', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'enable', 'produce', 'unique', 'weapons', 'fighting', 'mechanical', 'machines', 'animals', 'unique', 'girl', 'cost', 'girls', 'machines', 'animals', 'connected', 'destroyed', 'powers', 'girls', 'will', 'loose', 'most', 'precious', 'series', 'seemed', 'focus', 'mostly', 'character', 'Mai', 'Tokiha', 'one', 'twelve', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'called', 'HIME', 'the4', 'job', 'Himes', 'battle', 'demons', 'dimension', 'called', 'ORPHANS', 'who', 'series', 'mostly', 'seem', 'attack', 'private', 'school', 'himes', 'attend', 'course', ""'ll"", 'also', 'have', 'group', 'school', 'who', 'different', 'agenda', 'how', 'himes', 'should', 'use', 'powers', 'mysterious', 'leader', 'who', 'controlling', 'orphans', 'own', 'agenda', 'series', 'also', 'teenage', 'angst', 'romance', 'comedy', 'are', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'series', 'mostly', 'track', 'main', 'storyline', 'So', 'like', 'action', 'humorous', 'angst', 'romantic', 'animes', 'one', 'collection', '.I', 'do', 'want', 'clarify', 'something', 'saw', 'review', 'series', 'series', 'noway', 'same-sex', 'adult', 'scenes', 'saw', 'review', 'while', 'back', 'series', 'just', 'found', 'so', 'absurd', 'idiotic', 'are', 'four', 'female', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'personal', 'feelings', 'character', 'female', 'seem', 'be', 'romantic', 'feeling', 'noway', 'words', 'one', 'female', 'couple', 'kiss', 'nothing', 'stage', 'series', 'keep', 'focus', 'Himes', 'what', 'who', 'truly', 'wish', 'protect', 'what', 'ultimate', 'agenda', 'Himes', 'truly']",My-Hime: Complete Collection

1185960,AS5WZV6SBZAAK,B001EL6E9U,The Blue Raja,"[0, 0]","This series was recommended to me because of my love for Clamp's ""X"" series; a similar scenario where high school kids with super powers fight to save the world.  My-Hime, however, is significantly lighter, and is filled with much more comical teen-drama than I was prepared for.  There's also a lot of playful, yet innocent sexual (actually, more sexist) moments that makes it quite obvious that the series was created by males.  Being a male myself, it certainly doesn't bother me but I can see how many females would feel like they are being objectified as silly dolls that blush at the very site of any guy (not many guys in this series after all)... however, this is anime after all, so I guess that's the norm.  There's also a lot of same gender 'love' amongst the females, however light.At any rate, much of the first half of the series deals with crushes, high school drama, and getting to know the characters as they start to discover/use their powers.  The series takes a slightly darker turn during the latter half, and has some great action sequences.  For me the strength of this show is the creativity behind the character design and their respective ""child"" they summon for battle.  There are some really cool powers and creatures that come into play.  Natsuki (my favorite) for instance conjures up a cyber-dog named ""Duran"" who loads specific missile cartridges based on her command.  Meanwhile, Yukino Kikukawa summons ""Diana"" who's main power is to spread spores into the sky with video cameras to coincide with a bunch of viewing screens that surround her.  Though much of the drama is over-dramatic, you still begin to connect and feel for these kids, and in the end you'll enjoy the ride.  I was a bit disappointed with how it ends, and I won't spoil it with details, but I guess it should've been expected since this is a lighthearted series, and not as dark as others I've seen that would have a larger death count.I was surprised that the series was only in 4:3 ratio being done around 2004, but nevertheless the artwork is beautiful.
