1131244,A208I29OP8ZIRP,B0011GDIFQ,"William J. Irvin ""Mr. Movie""","[1, 1]","WARNING! The two-star review is generic because I had to give it something. I have NOT seen this DVD, BUT....I reviewed a DVD recently that was much like this. It was a compilation of three Jimmy Stewart movies that did not include the titles. I did some research and found the titles and posted my findings, in the interests of providing a bit of assistance.Here we go again. I LOVE Alfred Hitchcock and, yet again, we have a DVD which Amazon chooses to sell, yet does NOT identify any of the titles. But... my goodness! TWELVE reviews complaining that there are no titles? I can see one or two such reviews, maybe three, but twelve? After a couple, I would think composing yet another review to say the same thing is a bit of overkill, but then, what do I know? I give the two star review only because I had to give it SOMETHING.I may be out of line here, but I believe one of the ideas behind these reviews is to try and inform the reader what you thought about the DVD. Without knowing what movies are even on the DVD, I don't see how you can intelligently review it. So, we now have this DVD which has a staunch rating of ONE STAR on the Amazon website. I doubt it is the fault of the manufacturer that Amazon didn't see fit to reveal the titles, but not sure. I understand the concept of the 1 star rating, but I think that giving a DVD 1 star without knowing anything about it does a disservice not only to the manufacturer but also to the readers.Well, I DO know one thing... the movies that ARE on this DVD. Why Amazon would choose to sell a product without this information is beyond me but, once again, here goes. All are oldies that can be found on other compilations:THE LODGERTHE 39 STEPSTHE LADY VANISHESBLACKMAILRICH AND STRANGESABOTAGESECRET AGENTNUMBER 17The 1934 version of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCHIf you do a little research online, you will find these titles in less than the time it takes to post a review saying there are no titles listed. It's true it doesn't make sense for Amazon to try and sell a DVD without listing the titles, but if you're going to review a DVD after several people have already said the exact same thing, what's the point unless you have something new to add? Sorry, I'm really not trying to be flippant, but I just don't see the point. Reviews, IMO, should try to be as helpful as possible.I wouldn't buy this DVD, personally, but that's only because I have all these movies on another compilation disc that was a better deal than this one. This is not to dissuade you from purchasing it, just an observation on my part.Thanks for listening and hope this helps. Peace.",2,I have the titles....,1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,2618,"['WARNING', 'two-star', 'review', 'generic', 'had', 'give', 'something', 'have', 'NOT', 'seen', 'DVD', 'BUT', '.I', 'reviewed', 'DVD', 'recently', 'was', 'much', 'was', 'compilation', 'three', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'movies', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'titles', 'did', 'research', 'found', 'titles', 'posted', 'findings', 'interests', 'providing', 'bit', 'assistance.Here', 'go', 'again', 'LOVE', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'yet', 'again', 'have', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'sell', 'yet', 'NOT', 'identify', 'titles', 'goodness', 'TWELVE', 'complaining', 'are', 'titles', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'two', 'such', 'reviews', 'maybe', 'three', 'twelve', 'couple', 'would', 'think', 'composing', 'yet', 'review', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'bit', 'overkill', 'then', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'give', 'two', 'star', 'review', 'only', 'had', 'give', 'SOMETHING.I', 'may', 'be', 'line', 'here', 'believe', 'one', 'ideas', 'reviews', 'try', 'inform', 'reader', 'what', 'thought', 'DVD', 'knowing', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'even', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'can', 'intelligently', 'review', 'So', 'now', 'have', 'DVD', 'staunch', 'rating', 'ONE', 'STAR', 'Amazon', 'website', 'doubt', 'fault', 'manufacturer', 'Amazon', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'fit', 'reveal', 'titles', 'not', 'sure', 'understand', 'concept', '1', 'star', 'rating', 'think', 'giving', 'DVD', '1', 'star', 'knowing', 'anything', 'disservice', 'not', 'only', 'manufacturer', 'also', 'readers.Well', 'DO', 'know', 'one', 'thing', 'movies', 'ARE', 'DVD', 'Why', 'Amazon', 'would', 'choose', 'sell', 'product', 'information', 'once', 'again', 'here', 'are', 'oldies', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'other', 'compilations', 'THE', 'LODGERTHE', '39', 'STEPSTHE', 'LADY', 'VANISHESBLACKMAILRICH', 'AND', 'STRANGESABOTAGESECRET', 'AGENTNUMBER', '17The', '1934', 'version', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'KNEW', 'TOO', 'MUCHIf', 'do', 'little', 'research', 'online', 'will', 'find', 'titles', 'less', 'time', 'post', 'review', 'saying', 'are', 'titles', 'listed', 'true', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Amazon', 'try', 'sell', 'DVD', 'listing', 'titles', ""'re"", 'going', 'review', 'DVD', 'several', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'what', 'point', 'have', 'something', 'new', 'add', 'Sorry', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'flippant', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'point', 'Reviews', 'IMO', 'should', 'try', 'be', 'as', 'helpful', 'possible.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'personally', 'only', 'have', 'movies', 'compilation', 'disc', 'was', 'better', 'deal', 'one', 'not', 'dissuade', 'purchasing', 'just', 'observation', 'part.Thanks', 'listening', 'hope', 'helps', 'Peace']",N/A
