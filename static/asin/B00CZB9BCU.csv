What I felt was the major problem in this movie was trying to tell the romantic story of Fellers and his relationship with a Japanese woman and use it as a vehicle for helping us understand his love of Japan.  That part of the story was long, drawn out, and frankly, extremely boring, especially when someone starts watching the film thinking it's going to be, if not wholly, at least MOSTLY about MacArthur.I can think of better titles right off the top of my head (Nihon Blame Game) and cover pictures for the movie which wouldn't set those among us who feel very strongly about MacArthur, be it love or hate, completely befuddled when watching the movie, waiting for Tommie Lee Jones (who was, at most, a bit player in the film as MacArthur) to dazzle us with his performance as MacArthur.Now, through all this, even after all the things that ticked me off, I came off really enjoying the film, or at LEAST the parts which showed just how shrewd MacArthur was in his understanding of how to rebuild Japan, and how Fellers' played a major role in helping MacArthur understand just how much he could or could not count upon the Emperor. As others have said, the last scene in the film, the one where MacArthur finally meets and uses brilliant political savvy to both let Hirohito know MacArthur didn't see him as a god, and wasn't going to treat him as one, but at the same time using the words that so good leaders use so often when trying to let others know they don't consider themselves to be above their followers:  &#34;I need your help.&#34;Pull out the romantic garbage, focus more upon just how MacArthur had gone about rebuilding Japan and you'd have had an easy 5 star movie.  Instead we're left with a movie which is confused in its message and purpose.  It's worth watching for those interested in Japan right after American occupation, but if you're looking for some great insight into MacArthur as a leader (as in the book &#34;American Ceasar&#34;), skip it, unless you can watch it for free through Amazon Prime, in which case, skip the romantic scenes.

Although I was wondering whether General McArthur might have known about Fellers activities during ww2 about the Japanese girl and selected him because he had something then over Fellers. Maybe but as it is I thought the Japanese girl was a distraction in the story.One nic pick, is I doubt a Japanese general at Saipan and Okinawa would have survived these battles.So of my concerns are much more for example Emperor Hirohito did not go the first time to General MacArthur's home but to his headquarters. Why did the movie make such a big deal about that when it did not happen?This film does not discuss whether any options like Emperor Hirohito abdicates but his family remains in power were discussed. Nor does this film point out that not only was Hirohito spared but also anyone in the royal family, like Prince Yasuhiko Asaka who had much to answer for in Nanking Massacre. We are not given any discussion of this in the movie.What we are treated too is I thought a rather silly discussion of General MacArthur's presidential ambitions.Other then that everything is okay, the acting although no-one impressed me.

The result is that it is good at neither, in spite of the stellar performance of Tommy Lee Jones (as General MacArther) and Matthew Fox (as General Fellers).  In my opinion, the romance between General Fellers and his Japanese girl friend Aya Shimada (Eriko Hatsune), presented as a series of interlacing flash-backs, only serves to bog down the movie.  It would have been much better if all the romantic elements were cut out.  The historical drama of the aftermath of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the unconditional surrender of Japan, the subsequent arrests of Japanese war criminals, and General MacArther's all out effort to spare Emperor Hirohito from the gallows for political reasons is a lot more interesting.The script is based on the book His Majesty's Salvation written by Japanese author Shiro Okamoto.  Hence the film generally presents the Japanese view of the war:(1) Japan attacked Pearl Harbor only in response to the oil embargo imposed on Japan by President Franklin Roosevelt,(2) Japan attacked and defeated British and Dutch colonial powers in the Pacific and was indeed the liberator of the indigenous peoples from their colonial masters,(3) the use of atomic weapon on Japanese civilians by the American was just as criminal as the atrocities committed by the Japanese during the war, and(4) Emperor Hirohito was but a figurehead of imperial Japan and had little or nothing to do with Japanese war aggressions.Most, if not all, of these claims had been refuted by historians outside of Japan.

He said he feared that if he opposed Pearl Harbor he would be assassinated. Now that right there is subject ot debate. Was the man all of Japan worshiped as a God and a rallying point really that open to plotters and traitors? Did he not have his own Praetorian Guards, a later type of Samurai perhaps, dedicated to protect his life no matter what? We cant know because no real research that you couldn't find in an encyclopedia was done for this film. Could he not have had Tojo and all those suspect arrested? These are the kind of interesting bits of history that could have been introduced into the film, rather then leaving it to ""Hirohito was really a nice guy and whether his hands had the blood of over 2000 serviceman at Pearl Harbor on his hands, while using a version of ""Just following orders"" to ""Just going with the flow to keep my head""This film could have been a real great study of a man surrounded in mystery, who fiddled in his Garden while the Pacifc burned. The name of this movie after all is ""Emperor"" and we should have been treated to a better bit of history even if Hollywood would obviously throw in its stamp, like the General worried about his onetime girlfriend. What I saw in this movie was griping about the A-Bombs devastating effects, while the General just holds his tongue instead of mentioning that 1100 servicemen who were enjoying a beautiful Sunday morning, suddenly found themselves as combatants in a war they didnt know had till 7:50 Am 12-7-1941, and that if they didnt want Hiroshima and Nagasaki, then they shouldnt have brought it on in the first place and tried to settle the oil issue in some peaceful manner. Sounded all like kowtowing to the ""we were the bad guys for saving American and Japanese lives albeit at great collateral damage.""The only thing closest to historical truth was the presentation of MacArthur as a pompous climber.

1652590,AUCISQA1YXX86,B00CZB9BCU,Confederate,"[0, 0]","Being a diehard fan of General Douglas MacArthur, I was looking forward to seeing this movie and how he would be portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones. Having known the man in charge of MacArthur's Inchon operation, as well as the General's Russian niece and a World War II historian who had interviewed MacArthur (and was admittedly more taken with General Marshall); and having read various accounts by MacArthur's friends and foes, and, of course, his autobiography -- I was disappointed in this film. First, I expected it to be more about the events leading up to MacArthur's meeting with the Emperor. Instead, the General made only a few appearances and I never could shake the feeling of this being Tommy Lee Jones playing himself, rather than MacArthur. Also, my friend who was with MacArthur at Inchon told me a number of times that while the General could be aggravating at times, such as changing his uniform several times a day, he was always a gentleman. He used vulgarity only when extremely vexed and did not use the f-word in casual speech. Nor would it be like him to talk about dragging someone in by the balls. Gregory Peck captured the General's vainglorious swagger and manner of speaking to a much greater extent than Jones, who failed to understand that MacArthur rarely spoke without considering how what he was saying would look in print -- either in a newspaper or, preferably, in a history book.I have little doubt that MacArthur had already made up his mind about sparing the Emperor before he even stepped off the plane in Japan. He viewed himself as an expert on the Asian mind and knew he would be reviled in Japan's history should he hang the Emperor. Also, he had warned individual military commanders about the consequences of treating American POWs as they were, starving them and killing them at will. That's why, when he was visited by one of the daughters of a condemned Japanese General, hoping to spare her father's life, he refused, citing his reasons. It was not, as suggested in AMERICAN CAESAR, an arbitrary, capricious decision.In the end the film was a work of misdirection, setting MacArthur up to look like (at best) a sideshow, completely unwilling to take the decision onto his own shoulders. But we should keep in mind that he was, from the beginning, an outspoken critic of hanging the Emperor. If he selected people who would reach that decision without too much coaching, what's wrong with that? He also kept Japan intact, refusing to divide it with the Soviets as was the State Department's wont. It was MacArthur that put Japan back on its feet, guided them in writing its own constitution based on other great constitutions, including ours. He was the one who brought W. Edwards Deming to Japan and turned Japanese crap into quality products, all without creating an adversarial relationship between management and labor.In my view, they should have put a picture of General Fellers on the DVD.

The occupying U.S. Army under the aegis of General Douglas MacArthur(Tommy Lee Jones) are crafting a rebuilding of their conquered former enemies but there are a few pieces of business to take care of most notably the fate of Emperor Hirohito.  The people in the States want the Emperor hanged but MacArthur knows that he is regarded as a God in some quarters by his constituency.  Executing him may cause an uprising and MacArthur has to find compelling evidence to avoid putting Hirohito on trial.  He assigns the case to General Bonner Fellers(Matthew Fox) to gather evidence to either try or not try Hirohito and is given a scant ten days.  The beauty of ""Emperor"" is it works not so much as a conventional war film but a legal drama where the Army acts as attorneys for the most unlikely of defendants.  The film is intricately crafted and though we know the outcome it is interesting to see how history takes shape.  There are a few dry patches in the film but that might be because the makers are attempting to demonstrate the arduous nature of an investigation.  Some people find fault with a love story between Fellers and a Japanese girl shown in flashback prior to the war.  I didn't think these segments interfered with the narrative but added texture to the job that Fellers had at hand and what his emotions are about carrying it out.

The acting, dialogue and cinematography are excellent.Where the movie fails is in the details. A simple search on Wikipedia reveals that there was no love story as portrayed in the movie. For some reason Hollywood can't seem to take a compelling bit of reality and turn it into a movie without adding storylines which have no relation to the truth.  The Colonel certainly did not have the ability to redirect B-29s away from Shizuoka prefecture to avoid killing his(non-existent) former Japanese girlfriend. (In fact, even today there isn't much in Shizuoka which would be worth targeting by bombers, let alone in WW II, unless we wanted to strike the site of a future amusement park or ice rink.) His former girlfriend's uncle is portrayed is an Army General. In a late scene in the movie he talks about having  fought on Iwo Jima and committing terrible atrocities. Fact: something like 1% of the Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima for the battle survived the battle and if any of them were officers they weren't Generals- they were either killed or committed Seppuku(ritual suicide). In all my travels around Japan alone or with my wife and her family I have never read an account of a Japanese officer - either in Japanese or translated into English- where he apologized for atrocities the army committed. The emperor is portrayed as sort of a sheltered nave powerless figurehead victimized by a military regime who used his name to justify war. This is a popular belief but is a fictional fabrication of the Imperial Household Agency and the  GHQ after the war to prevent the execution of the emperor (which GHQ- wrongly!- believed  would turn the Japanese public against the occupying forces).  Of course the Imperial Household Agency wanted to protect the emperor. The reality is somewhere between the innocent powerless victim  and war mongering fanatic he was believed to be during the war. He certainly was aware of the details of the China campaigns and evidence strongly suggests he supported them. (Frankly, what King, Emperor  etc of the time *didn't* want conquest in his name?. During the Battle of Guadalcanal he was angry that his forces couldn't sacrifice more and prevail. Hardly a disinterested victim of the war. It is true however that he was much more interested in marine biology than warfare and was probably not a war monger like Hitler or Mussolini. There are a number of books on the subject of the true nature of Hirohito's culpability for the Pacific War- I think there is one called ""Hirohito and the making of Modern Japan"" by Herbert Bix, for example. Lastly, would the Japanese have revolted if we tried and executed Hirohito? Here's what Japanese acquaintances who were born before the war have told me: No!

Hartley,"[3, 5]","The heroes and villains are not easily delineated in ""Emperor"", an uneven hybrid of History Channel docudrama and Lifetime weepie based on Shiro Okamoto's book and directed by Peter Weber. Set in post-WW 2 Japan at the dawn of the American occupation, the story centers on the roundup of key Japanese military and political leaders to be tried for war crimes. President Truman has appointed General Douglas MacArthur (a scenery-chewing Tommy Lee Jones) to oversee the operation; he in turn delegates ""Japan expert"" Brigadier General Bonner Fellers (tepid leading man Matthew Fox) to see that the task is executed pronto. Fellers is also directed to investigate whether the biggest fish, Emperor Hirohito (Takataro Kataoka) gave direct input on war strategy. MacArthur has allotted him only a week or so to conduct his investigation (no pressure!).Indeed, the question of the Emperor's guilt is a complex one (and the most historically fascinating element of the film). Was he merely a figurehead, kept carefully squirreled away in his hermetic bubble throughout the war and occasionally trotted out for propagandistic purposes? Or did he have a direct say in day-to-day military decisions, perhaps even giving a direct blessing for the attack on Pearl Harbor? And there is the cultural element to consider. MacArthur (at least as depicted in the film) was shrewd enough to realize that if he could build a working relationship with Hirohito, perhaps the Emperor could in turn persuade the populace to cooperate with their overseers, thereby expediting the rebuild of Japan's socio-political infrastructure. Even if he was a paper tiger, the Emperor's words traditionally held substantial sway over the Japanese people.Unfortunately, screenwriters Vera Blasi and David Klass shoot themselves in the foot and sidestep this potentially provocative historical reassessment by injecting an unconvincing romantic subplot involving Fellers' surreptitious search to discover the fate of a Japanese exchange student (Aya Shimada) who he dated in college (the young woman, whose father was a general in the Imperial Army, returned to Japan before the war). The flashback scenes recapping the relationship are curiously devoid of passion and dramatically flat, grinding the film to a halt with each intrusion. While Fox has a touch of stoic Henry Fonda/Gary Cooper vibe going for him, his performance feels wooden, especially when up against Jones, who makes the most of his brief screen time (even he is given short shrift, mostly relegated to caricature and movie trailer-friendly lines like ""Let's show them some good old-fashioned American swagger!""). I sense that at some point during the film's development there was an interesting James Clavell-style culture-clash drama in here somewhere. But when the denouement is a re-enactment of an historic photo that slowly dissolves from the actors into the actual photo?

General MacArthur is playfully portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, one of the best actors in today's cinema in my opinion. Jones helps to provide moments of gravitas that help the story move along especially when he is dealing directly with the Emperor. On second thought, the story never defines which of the two personalities in the movie are the Emperor of the movie, MacArthur or the Japanese God-King . There is no doubt in hindsight that the real General MacArthur made the correct decision in how he dealt with the Japanese God-King for the sake of the future that we live in today. For that many kudos obtain! In the movie, Jones puts much of that gravitas on display, albeit he has very little screen time. Meanwhile the story wends its way around the investigation of the Emperor's role in starting and ending the war. The angst portrayed by the investigating Brigadier General and the muted love story are obviously  too far from reality but they do provide a texture to the backdrop of the seriousness involved in the decision to keep the Emperor on the throne instead of attempting to try him for the war crimes that his military were responsible for across Asia and the Pacific.

1652639,A1R29FLZWPCURK,B00CZB9BCU,George Goldberg,"[0, 0]","There is still much controversy over the culpability of Hirohito for the wars Japan started in the 1930s and for Pearl Harbor, and for the extremely brutal behavior of Japanese troops. Some, like this movie, suggest that he was largely a passive figurehead. Others, like a humongous biography which came out a few years ago, charge him with a much more active role and insist he should have been tried as a war criminal. As the case was unclear in 1945, there was surely no good reason why he should not have been tried so that actual evidence, supported by the sworn testimony of participants with actual knowledge, could have been adduced. Then, if there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt, he could have been properly exonerated; or, of course, if there was such proof, he could have been hanged like other Japanese and German war criminals at the end of World War II.What this movie suggests is that the man who made the decision not to try Hirohito was unduly influenced by an American &#8220;expert&#8221; on Japan whose love for that country, and especially for the love of his life who died in an Allied bombing raid, at best compromised his objectivity, at worst put his loyalty to the U.S. in question. Now, General MacArthur knew General Fellers well, and was fully familiar with his knowledge of and affection for Japan; and if MacArthur put this momentous decision entirely in Fellers&#8217; hands, it was obviously for the purpose of giving MacArthur cover for a decision he had already made but which would be very unpopular at home. As for the love story, it is apparently pure fiction, as Fellers was married in 1925 and was accompanied by his wife in his foreign postings. The girl is very pretty indeed, but the flashbacks became increasingly annoying, and even if true were overdone &#8211; one romp through the bamboo woods was more than enough, the second was as irritating as a repeated commercial; that they were not true certainly compounds the offense.Then there was the 10-day deadline for investigating such a complex issue involving a near invisible person, intensely loyal followers, and a difficult foreign language and culture, and coming to a conclusion which would affect the conduct and possibly the outcome of the occupation. That was utterly implausible; had such an order been given, MacArthur, who never showed much deference to decisions from Washington (he was ultimately dismissed in 1951 by President Truman for overt insubordination), would never have accepted so manifestly inadequate a deadline; and I have read that the actual time which MacArthur took to determine not to try Hirohito was 5 months. After all, as MacArthur arrived in Tokyo as Supreme Commander in September 1945, and the Tokyo War Crimes trials started in May 1946, there was no hurry, certainly no ticking bomb which had to be defused in a mere 10 days.Two major themes in the movie, then &#8211; the love story and the ridiculous deadline &#8211; were made up out of whole cloth. How about the rest of the movie? In light of its central fictions, who knows? So, I didn&#8217;t learn anything from this movie, except perhaps how really exotic, even alien, the Japanese are (or pretended to be, to hoodwink the gullible Americans &#8211; and after all, their inscrutable act worked and Hirohito remained on his throne until his death in 1989). Perhaps worst of all for a movie, it was heavy going with not a single hint of wit; and an American general, a personal aide to the Supreme Commander in occupied Japan, getting into a barroom brawl? Please. The saving grace? I can&#8217;t think of any &#8211; except the girl was really, really pretty.",2,"Didn't happen that way, but the girl is really pretty",1405900800,"07 21, 2014",2014,3678,"['still', 'much', 'controversy', 'culpability', 'Hirohito', 'wars', 'Japan', 'started', '1930s', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'extremely', 'brutal', 'behavior', 'Japanese', 'troops', 'movie', 'suggest', 'was', 'largely', 'passive', 'figurehead', 'Others', 'humongous', 'biography', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'charge', 'much', 'more', 'active', 'role', 'insist', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'tried', 'war', 'criminal', 'case', 'was', 'unclear', '1945', 'was', 'surely', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'tried', 'actual', 'evidence', 'supported', 'sworn', 'testimony', 'participants', 'actual', 'knowledge', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'adduced', 'Then', 'was', 'proof', 'reasonable', 'doubt', 'guilt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'properly', 'exonerated', 'course', 'was', 'such', 'proof', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hanged', 'other', 'Japanese', 'German', 'war', 'criminals', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II.What', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'decision', 'not', 'try', 'Hirohito', 'was', 'unduly', 'influenced', 'American', '8220', '8221', 'Japan', 'love', 'country', 'especially', 'love', 'life', 'who', 'died', 'Allied', 'bombing', 'raid', 'best', 'compromised', 'objectivity', 'worst', 'put', 'loyalty', 'U.S.', 'question', 'Now', 'General', 'MacArthur', 'knew', 'General', 'Fellers', 'well', 'was', 'fully', 'familiar', 'knowledge', 'affection', 'Japan', 'MacArthur', 'put', 'momentous', 'decision', 'entirely', 'Fellers', '8217', 'hands', 'was', 'obviously', 'purpose', 'giving', 'MacArthur', 'cover', 'decision', 'had', 'already', 'made', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'unpopular', 'home', 'love', 'story', 'apparently', 'pure', 'fiction', 'Fellers', 'was', 'married', '1925', 'was', 'accompanied', 'wife', 'foreign', 'postings', 'girl', 'very', 'pretty', 'indeed', 'flashbacks', 'became', 'increasingly', 'annoying', 'even', 'true', 'were', 'overdone', '8211', 'one', 'romp', 'bamboo', 'woods', 'was', 'more', 'enough', 'second', 'was', 'as', 'irritating', 'repeated', 'commercial', 'were', 'not', 'true', 'certainly', 'offense.Then', 'was', '10-day', 'deadline', 'investigating', 'such', 'complex', 'issue', 'involving', 'near', 'invisible', 'person', 'intensely', 'loyal', 'followers', 'difficult', 'foreign', 'language', 'culture', 'coming', 'conclusion', 'would', 'affect', 'conduct', 'possibly', 'outcome', 'occupation', 'was', 'utterly', 'implausible', 'had', 'order', 'been', 'given', 'MacArthur', 'who', 'never', 'showed', 'much', 'deference', 'decisions', 'Washington', 'was', 'ultimately', 'dismissed', '1951', 'President', 'Truman', 'overt', 'insubordination', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'accepted', 'so', 'manifestly', 'inadequate', 'deadline', 'have', 'read', 'actual', 'time', 'MacArthur', 'took', 'determine', 'not', 'try', 'Hirohito', 'was', '5', 'months', 'MacArthur', 'arrived', 'Tokyo', 'Supreme', 'Commander', 'September', '1945', 'Tokyo', 'War', 'Crimes', 'trials', 'started', 'May', '1946', 'was', 'hurry', 'certainly', 'ticking', 'bomb', 'had', 'be', 'defused', 'mere', '10', 'days.Two', 'major', 'themes', 'movie', 'then', '8211', 'love', 'story', 'ridiculous', 'deadline', '8211', 'were', 'made', 'up', 'whole', 'cloth', 'How', 'rest', 'movie', 'light', 'central', 'fictions', 'who', 'So', 'didn', '8217', 'learn', 'anything', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'how', 'really', 'exotic', 'even', 'alien', 'Japanese', 'are', 'pretended', 'be', 'hoodwink', 'gullible', 'Americans', '8211', 'inscrutable', 'act', 'worked', 'Hirohito', 'remained', 'throne', 'death', '1989', 'Perhaps', 'worst', 'movie', 'was', 'heavy', 'going', 'not', 'single', 'hint', 'wit', 'American', 'general', 'personal', 'aide', 'Supreme', 'Commander', 'occupied', 'Japan', 'getting', 'barroom', 'brawl', 'Please', 'saving', 'grace', 'can', '8217', 'think', '8211', 'girl', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'pretty']",N/A

What this movie showed was the struggle between those  who wanted to punish the Japanese & wreak vengeance for their wartime crimes & those who realized that a scorched earth policy when it came to the japanese culture would not get us (America& Europe) what we wanted & needed from that part of the world. Blame had to be assigned, of course, & it was-- but did the Emperor himself give the orders or did his military? Yes this movie is tilted toward the mercy part of the outcome but that doesn;t change the fact that , in the long run, not trying him for war crimes was the right decision. We at least learned that much from the end of WWI. The movie is good at exposing the clash of cultures.....could there be 2 more different cultures than the US and japan in the 1930-40&#34;s??  The movie does not excuse the japanese for their crimes but it does point out that few world powers are guilt free when it comes to taking over & controlling other nations. It was the sheer force of will, probably MacArthur's but also other world leaders, that allowed us to help re-build Japan. No easy task because the one thing this movie did not show clearly is how utterly ruthless the japanese were to other Asian countries -- they treated ALL other cultures as inferior & of no value what-so-ever. They despised other Asians & that feeling was returned 1000x over once Japan lost. So it really was astonishing that we chose to help instead of flattening what was left of that country. We did have the moral high ground & we used it the way it should have been used. History has shown us the value of these choices -- only one of many tough choices & maybe in a more superficial way than it merits but the story is moving, the acting is solid & the ending scene is excellent & may indeed show why MacArthur was THE man for this job even if he was a Sonnofa-B.

Director Peter Webber (Hannibal Rising, Girl with a Pearl Earring) keeps what might have been a patchwork quilt story tightly woven and if the movie delivers nothing else, it gives insight into the relationship between Japan and the US after the devastation of the atomic bomb and the resultant surrender of Japan. For that alone the film is well worth watching.The setting of the film is 1945 when General MacArthur (Tommy Lee Jones) steps onto the shores of Japan as the Supreme Commander of the occupying forces. Assigned to rebuild Japan after the war MacArthur selects General Bonner Fellers (Matthew Fox), a man with a history with Japan before the war, including a love affair with a Japanese student Aya Shimada (Eriko Hatsune) in America before the war: Aya returned to Japan when relations with between Japan and the US began to dissolve and Fellers followed her for a futile attempt to overcome differences between cultures and impending historic changes, to investigate whether Emperor Hirohito (Takatar Kataoka) should be tried and hanged as a war criminal. Memories of Aya and his quest to find her in the ravaged post-war landscape help Fellers to discover both his wisdom and his humanity and enable him to come to the momentous decision that changed the course of history and the future of two nations. He meets with the advisors to the Emperor, is rebuked by the Japanese citizenry, and is frustrated with the information he is basically unable to gather until he finally arranges through the aid of his translator chauffeur a meeting between the Emperor and MacArthur in which the Emperor's perception of human dignity is presented and MacArthur has found his answer Feller's sought.Throughout the film we are reminded about the basic cultural differences between not only East and West, but particularly the culture of Japan - a culture deeply dependent on devotion to Emperor and country. It is an enlightening journey for us as audience, one of understanding and respect, and one that should be more widely shared. Matthew Fox does well with his bifurcated role and he is strongly supported by a very fine cast of Japanese actors.  This is a film from which we all can learn important issues while being entertained with a fine period piece.

1652672,ABP0RCZCVMRRG,B00CZB9BCU,"J. DeMeo ""naturalenergyworks""","[5, 7]","Fairly accurate discussion of the period surrounding the Japanese surrender, and the events leading into it.  Some felt Hirohito should have been hung, and their arguments are reasonable and valid. Japan never confronted its atrocities during WW2 as did the German people confronted theirs under Hitler, and most young Japanese have no idea of the wretched butchery Japan committed - which has political consequences today as no Japanese leader has truly apologized for what they did in China, for example, leaving the Chinese with constant fury over Japanese behavior against their ancestors (forget for a moment Mao Zedongs' even worse atrocities, as the average Chinese has no idea about that either).  The film has a Japanese giving a lecture to an embarrassed American on world history, as if America was &#34;Just as bad&#34; by fully false moral equivalence, as a set up to discuss the atom bombing of Hiroshima and fire-bombing of Tokyo etc., but not a peep about the rapine torture and massacre of 350,000 mostly unarmed Chinese civilians in Nanking by Japanese using Samauri swords and bayonettes, nor the use of Black Plague germ warfare on Chinese regions by Japan as they were withdrawing from, which took another quarter-million lives.  Nor the bombing of Manila and brutal rape-slavery of Philippino and Korean women, men being labor slaves or just killed... etc., etc.  Or the fanatical savagery of Japanese troops on their captured islands, where surrender was forbidden by Shinto warrior codes, and thereby they abused and tortured surrendered British, Americans and Australians without restraint.  Or the Kamakazi attacks, which came too late to end the war in their favor, but made the Americans furious and convinced that any landing of troops to take the Japanese homeland would be a multi-million casualty blood-bath -- which led directly to the decision to use the a-bomb.Even American youth are not taught these details even as the a-bombs or incindiary raids (which killed far fewer than the two single events in China mentioned above) are emphasized.  The film is typical Hollywood left-wing degenerate, though the acting of the various players, and reasonable accuracy of Hirohito trying to cut a deal to surrender before and after the a-bombs has validity, though even that could be made clearer.  Factually, Hirohito's agents made a secret outreach to America through the Soviet Embassy, but Americans realized he was not directly in control of the Japanese military, and so could not take his gestures as meaningful -- which in any case always demanded his status as God Emperor be preserved.  He was far more involved in the decision-making to start the war, invading China (Manchuria) which was another series of atrocities, as well as continuing the war so long as the outcome favored the &#34;God-Chosen Superior Being&#34; Japanese Empire.  As one Japanese MP said (and was shot by an angry associate) &#34;Hirohito was willing to fight to the very last Japanese person, to save his own sorry life as a God&#34;.As to MacArthur, the film might have included a sentence or two about his benign dictatorship, where by declaration he re-organized Japanese society to rid it of feudal slavery.  Feudal land-holdings were broken up, with real land distribution to peasant farmers (not like in Communist nations, where such was promised but the Communist Party actually kept all lands and profits for itself).  He ended hereditary prostitution and arranged marriages, gave women freedom and established a parlaiment where everyone had equal vote, plus a legal system of independent jurists.  The Emperor was forced to renounce his &#34;God&#34; status and go walk among the people, showing he was an ordinary nose-picker like everyone else.Bottom line:  Don't trust Hollywood movies for your history lessons.",3,"Interesting film, but too much PC nonsense and historical inaccuracy.",1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,3838,"['Fairly', 'accurate', 'discussion', 'period', 'surrounding', 'Japanese', 'surrender', 'events', 'leading', 'felt', 'Hirohito', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'hung', 'arguments', 'are', 'reasonable', 'valid', 'Japan', 'never', 'confronted', 'atrocities', 'WW2', 'did', 'German', 'people', 'confronted', 'theirs', 'Hitler', 'most', 'young', 'Japanese', 'have', 'idea', 'wretched', 'butchery', 'Japan', 'committed', 'political', 'consequences', 'today', 'Japanese', 'leader', 'truly', 'apologized', 'what', 'did', 'China', 'example', 'leaving', 'Chinese', 'constant', 'fury', 'Japanese', 'behavior', 'ancestors', 'forget', 'moment', 'Mao', 'Zedongs', 'even', 'worse', 'atrocities', 'average', 'Chinese', 'idea', 'film', 'Japanese', 'giving', 'lecture', 'embarrassed', 'American', 'world', 'history', 'America', 'was', '34', 'Just', 'bad', '34', 'fully', 'false', 'moral', 'equivalence', 'set', 'up', 'discuss', 'atom', 'bombing', 'Hiroshima', 'fire-bombing', 'Tokyo', 'etc.', 'not', 'peep', 'rapine', 'torture', 'massacre', '350,000', 'mostly', 'unarmed', 'Chinese', 'civilians', 'Nanking', 'Japanese', 'using', 'Samauri', 'swords', 'bayonettes', 'use', 'Black', 'Plague', 'germ', 'warfare', 'Chinese', 'regions', 'Japan', 'were', 'withdrawing', 'took', 'quarter-million', 'bombing', 'Manila', 'brutal', 'rape-slavery', 'Philippino', 'Korean', 'women', 'men', 'being', 'labor', 'slaves', 'just', 'killed', 'etc.', 'etc', 'fanatical', 'savagery', 'Japanese', 'troops', 'captured', 'islands', 'where', 'surrender', 'was', 'forbidden', 'Shinto', 'warrior', 'codes', 'thereby', 'abused', 'tortured', 'surrendered', 'British', 'Americans', 'Australians', 'restraint', 'Kamakazi', 'attacks', 'came', 'too', 'late', 'end', 'war', 'favor', 'made', 'Americans', 'furious', 'convinced', 'landing', 'troops', 'take', 'Japanese', 'homeland', 'would', 'be', 'multi-million', 'casualty', 'blood-bath', 'led', 'directly', 'decision', 'use', 'a-bomb.Even', 'American', 'youth', 'are', 'not', 'taught', 'details', 'even', 'a-bombs', 'incindiary', 'raids', 'killed', 'far', 'fewer', 'two', 'single', 'events', 'China', 'mentioned', 'are', 'emphasized', 'film', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'left-wing', 'degenerate', 'acting', 'various', 'players', 'reasonable', 'accuracy', 'Hirohito', 'trying', 'cut', 'deal', 'surrender', 'a-bombs', 'validity', 'though', 'even', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'clearer', 'Factually', 'Hirohito', 'agents', 'made', 'secret', 'outreach', 'America', 'Soviet', 'Embassy', 'Americans', 'realized', 'was', 'not', 'directly', 'control', 'Japanese', 'military', 'so', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'gestures', 'meaningful', 'case', 'always', 'demanded', 'status', 'God', 'Emperor', 'be', 'preserved', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'involved', 'decision-making', 'start', 'war', 'invading', 'China', 'Manchuria', 'was', 'series', 'atrocities', 'as', 'well', 'continuing', 'war', 'so', 'long', 'outcome', 'favored', '34', 'God-Chosen', 'Superior', 'Being', '34', 'Japanese', 'Empire', 'one', 'Japanese', 'MP', 'said', 'was', 'shot', 'angry', 'associate', '34', 'Hirohito', 'was', 'willing', 'fight', 'very', 'last', 'Japanese', 'person', 'save', 'own', 'sorry', 'life', 'God', '34', '.As', 'MacArthur', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'included', 'sentence', 'two', 'benign', 'dictatorship', 'where', 'declaration', 're-organized', 'Japanese', 'society', 'rid', 'feudal', 'slavery', 'Feudal', 'land-holdings', 'were', 'broken', 'up', 'real', 'land', 'distribution', 'peasant', 'farmers', 'not', 'Communist', 'nations', 'where', 'such', 'was', 'promised', 'Communist', 'Party', 'actually', 'kept', 'lands', 'profits', 'ended', 'hereditary', 'prostitution', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'gave', 'women', 'freedom', 'established', 'parlaiment', 'where', 'everyone', 'had', 'equal', 'vote', 'legal', 'system', 'independent', 'jurists', 'Emperor', 'was', 'forced', 'renounce', '34', 'God', '34', 'status', 'go', 'walk', 'people', 'showing', 'was', 'ordinary', 'nose-picker', 'everyone', 'else.Bottom', 'line', 'Do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'history', 'lessons']",N/A

However, it was not really about what it said it was about: The Emperor and Gen. MacArthur. There was entirely too much time spent on the personal relationship between the Gen. Fellers and the Aya.  Also the flashbacks made for a very confusing presentation.  It took a moment or two sometime to figure out where you were.However, the point was made and made clearly as to the Emperor's role in the war.  Most important his position in the country before the war and during the war as well as the great personal risk he took in 1) making the broadcast of surrender and 2) meeting with Gen. MacArthur.  It also made a very clear point that whatever his faults, MacArthur was intelligent enough to realize how important it was to get Japan on its feet again.There were a look of seriously missed opportunities in this film.

Anyone who has studied this time period, post WWII Japan, especially as a gaijin, will attest to our lack of evidence to make a convincing argument concerning Hirohito's true role in all that happened in Japan. (cf: Herbert Bix's ""Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan"") That part of this film that seems well done, is no doubt due to the Japanese input into it.  I have spent some years in Japan and studied its history as a non-academic.  So, like many of the other reviewers have stated, the ultimate judgement of the movie is that it could have been so much more.  Another Hollywood failed opportunity in my opinion.  The fabricated love element with General Fellers is a tough one, as it adds some balance to understanding of the national Japanese character, but again as others have said it too often interrupts what should be the crux of this movie, and perhaps the love story should have been another movie entirely separate from this one.  So, I have very mixed feelings overall.  But what it could have been is a masterpiece:  a movie of deeply spiritual epiphanies for those who have never been to Japan and an insight into the good choices made in the complexity of the rebuilding of a wounded nation.  Despite all the years of rocky relationship between it and the U.S since the arrival of our ""Black Ships"" in the mid 1800's, and I am biased no doubt, this movie grants us a tiny peek into the nobility of errors and beauties that comprise a country I love so much.  Probably better that the film exists, than if it did not.  But I could see someone argue that it should not have been made unless it was done immaculately.

I had expected to see a movie about MacArthur's relationship with the Japanese Emperor during the occupation. What I got was a bad characterization, and not a historically accurate one either, of Gen Bonner Fellers. Gen Fellers was on MacArthur's staff and was charged with investigating the emperor for war crimes. This opened up the opportunity for some dialog accusing the west of being as big an imperialist power as Japan. And, of course, Gen Fellers had a romantic relationship with a Japanese girl before the war and he used his office to try to find her. His investigation culminated with a description of the attempted coup by the militarists once they learned that the Emperor had made a recording about surrendering to the Americans. This was shown as proof enough that the Emperor had resisted the militarists and was therefore not guilty of war crimes.The actual history, of course, is more complicated. The government had done several studies on Japanese culture during the war that underscored the need to keep the Emperor in place as a pacifying influence on the population. Keeping him was a central part of the occupation planning.I can't recommend this movie, even if it does have Tommy Lee Jones.

And granted this movie appears to get some of the historical stuff wrong and also throws a romance into the historical part of the movie as well.

But this movie has a good story loosely based on the dilemma of whether or not to prosecute the Japanese emperor after WWII with a believable although somewhat fictional romance thrown in.  Although this romance may not be Fellers story, it could have been some soldiers story whether it be American or Japanese who lost their loved ones in war.

Note that the historical part of it would not have taken place as it did without the romance, and the pre-war interest and expertise in Japanese culture of the general that MacArthur was wise enough to appoint.  I did find the romance, and the flashbacks, to be a little distracting at first, and wanted to see more Tommy Lee Jones as MacArthur, but by the end of the movie it all seemed to to fit.

This film about gathering proof of Emperor Hirohito's support or opposition to Japan's role in World War II is more wishful thinking than history.Tommy Lee Jones plays General Douglas MacArthur, his opening scene complete with sunglasses and corncob pipe. Those in Hampton Roads are familiar with the General. The MacArthur Memorial holds memorabilia of his role in the Pacific Theater, along with the many men and women who served with him. Located in Norfolk, VA, the museum is filled with Japan's tribute to the man who championed the country's restoration after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.If you're a history buff, best save your money for a trip to Norfolk.Director Peter Webber (""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" ""Hannibal Rising"") presents `Emperor' as an uphill battle against those who want to see Japan decimated for the bombing at Pearl Harbor and its role in WWII, and those pulling for restoration. A good question after the brutal devastation of not one but two atom bombs.It should make a good movie sometime.The role of MacArthur's lead investigator, Gen. Bonner Fellers, goes to Matthew Fox of ""Lost."" Fox and Jones have good chemistry together. (I'd like to see this team in action again.) Still, much is made of Fellers' possible romance with a young Japanese woman; his budding relationship with her before the war, and his search for her afterwards as he looks for information to exonerate or condemn Hirohito.The small budget movie was filmed in New Zealand and looks fantastic. Locations certainly bring to mind the historic look of the United States and a post-war Japan. As pointed out in a technically-minded commentary with Webber and producer Yuko Narahashi, very little greenscreen was used. But it must be said that the best effect is Tommy Lee Jones; his face is a sunbaked landscape that commands the high-def picture whenever he appears.Extras also include a handful of deleted scenes, adding a touch more character development. A featurette, ""Revenge or Justice: The Making of `Emperor'"" doesn't tell us any more than the film and commentary, although it has a short interview with Fox. Photos in the behind-the-scenes gallery are unremarkable; ""The Historic Photo Gallery"" has only two pictures.The commentary offers an occasional tidbit - such as the actor who plays Hirohito is a Kabuki actor, who plays female roles. He studied the Emperor's body language in newsreel footage, making him a strong onscreen match for Tommy Lee's General.Another tidbit is that, tasked with coming up with a Southern curse, Webber asked Jones if he had any recommendations. The actor provided a list the next day; they chose one - you'll recognize it when you hear it.And we also learn that Fellers' romance is more conjecture than truth. No surprise there.But give Webber credit for the worst statement I've ever heard in a commentary. Noting the historic afterwards photos at the end of the film, highlighting the demotion of both MacArthur and Fellers, Webber dismisses them as something ""audiences seem to like."" And it's up to viewers to find out why; it's not his place to give history lessons.Just something to keep in mind if you decide to watch this flick.-- Kay Reynolds",3,Not much history in Webber's 'Emperor',1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,3329,"['IT', 'LIKE', 'WATCHING', 'history', 'romance', 'writer', 'lens', 'history-light', 'way', 'might', 'like', 'imagine', 'be', 'film', 'gathering', 'proof', 'Emperor', 'Hirohito', 'support', 'opposition', 'Japan', 'role', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'more', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'history.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'General', 'Douglas', 'MacArthur', 'opening', 'scene', 'complete', 'sunglasses', 'corncob', 'pipe', 'Hampton', 'Roads', 'are', 'familiar', 'General', 'MacArthur', 'Memorial', 'memorabilia', 'role', 'Pacific', 'Theater', 'many', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'served', 'Located', 'Norfolk', 'VA', 'museum', 'filled', 'Japan', 'tribute', 'man', 'who', 'championed', 'country', 'restoration', 'bombing', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki.If', ""'re"", 'history', 'buff', 'best', 'save', 'money', 'trip', 'Norfolk.Director', 'Peter', 'Webber', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'Emperor', 'uphill', 'battle', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'Japan', 'decimated', 'bombing', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'role', 'WWII', 'pulling', 'restoration', 'good', 'question', 'brutal', 'devastation', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'atom', 'bombs.It', 'should', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'sometime.The', 'role', 'MacArthur', 'lead', 'investigator', 'Gen.', 'Bonner', 'Fellers', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Lost', 'Fox', 'Jones', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'team', 'action', 'again', 'Still', 'much', 'made', 'Fellers', 'possible', 'romance', 'young', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'budding', 'relationship', 'war', 'search', 'afterwards', 'information', 'exonerate', 'condemn', 'Hirohito.The', 'small', 'budget', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'New', 'Zealand', 'fantastic', 'Locations', 'certainly', 'bring', 'mind', 'historic', 'look', 'United', 'States', 'post-war', 'Japan', 'pointed', 'out', 'technically-minded', 'commentary', 'Webber', 'producer', 'Yuko', 'Narahashi', 'very', 'little', 'greenscreen', 'was', 'used', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'best', 'effect', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'face', 'sunbaked', 'landscape', 'high-def', 'picture', 'whenever', 'also', 'include', 'handful', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'adding', 'touch', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'featurette', 'Revenge', 'Justice', 'Making', 'Emperor', ""n't"", 'tell', 'more', 'film', 'commentary', 'short', 'interview', 'Fox', 'Photos', 'behind-the-scenes', 'gallery', 'are', 'unremarkable', 'Historic', 'Photo', 'Gallery', 'only', 'two', 'pictures.The', 'commentary', 'offers', 'occasional', 'tidbit', 'such', 'actor', 'who', 'Hirohito', 'Kabuki', 'actor', 'who', 'female', 'roles', 'studied', 'Emperor', 'body', 'language', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'making', 'strong', 'onscreen', 'match', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'General.Another', 'tidbit', 'tasked', 'coming', 'up', 'Southern', 'curse', 'Webber', 'asked', 'Jones', 'had', 'recommendations', 'actor', 'provided', 'list', 'next', 'day', 'chose', 'one', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'when', 'hear', 'also', 'learn', 'Fellers', 'romance', 'more', 'conjecture', 'truth', 'surprise', 'there.But', 'give', 'Webber', 'credit', 'worst', 'statement', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'commentary', 'Noting', 'historic', 'afterwards', 'photos', 'end', 'film', 'highlighting', 'demotion', 'MacArthur', 'Fellers', 'Webber', 'something', 'audiences', 'seem', 'like', 'up', 'viewers', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'not', 'place', 'give', 'history', 'lessons.Just', 'something', 'keep', 'mind', 'decide', 'watch', 'flick.', 'Kay', 'Reynolds']",N/A

It's more about Brigadier General Bonner Fellers (played by Matthew Fox). It's his point of view from the start that we witness the struggles he and MacArthur (Tommy Lee Jones) went through. How Fellers painstakingly investigated the role that Emperor Hirohito in war crimes (attack on Pearl Harbor). It was also a bit about Fellers experience when he first visited Japan before the war started. And about the Japanese woman, Aya Shimada (Eriko Hatsune), he fell in love with.It was really good. My grandpa watched it with me. He wasn't quite sure about watching it. We both enjoyed it. It was a nice piece on adding Fellers' experience in Japan before the war. It gave a better human understanding to who the Japanese people are and their culture. Matthew Fox did a good job I thought. So did Tommy as MacArthur.

1652724,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00CZB9BCU,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","This movie reminds me of ""Pearl Harbor"" in that the film attempts to conflate an epic time in American history with romantic drama.  I suspect that lure has plenty of rationale behind it and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  Here's an example of how it doesn't.  Based on a book by Hiro Okamoto and written by Vera Blasi and David Klass, director Peter Webber teases the audience with some of the inner workings of General Douglas McArthur (Tommy Lee Jones) who was assigned by President Truman to ""rebuild"" Japan after a couple A-bombs destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.One of the key elements in McArthur's plan is yet to be decided.  Specifically, what to do with Emperor Hirohito (Takataro Kataoka).  He was considered a god by the Japanese and there was concern of making him a martyr if he was tried and convicted of war crimes.  Still, what was his role in the attack on America?  McArthur assigned the task of investigating Hirohito's role to Brig. General Bonner Fellers (Matthew Fox) who had lived briefly in Japan and had a romantic relationship with Aya who he met in college when she was studying in America.About the time the viewer becomes interested in the crime procedural, Fellers drifts off to dreamland and we get a flashback of some point in his relationship with Aya.  He is also determined to find her in Japan or at least what happened to her.  If this sound interesting, it isn't.  We do get to see another side of the ambitious McArthur who is portrayed as a hard-liner and had eyes on the White House.  Certainly true by most accounts, but here he is also an expert manipulator of process.  He is aware that the future of Japan and certainly its relationship with America would be best served by allowing the Emperor to remain a figurehead which he most likely was anyway.  Not wanting to appear soft however, Feller's empathy for the Japanese and likely recommendation would make his position more palatable.In the end the movie just stalls when Fellers memories kick in or when he is out searching for Aya.  Fox doesn't help things much with his wooden performance.  Jones certainly invigorates the film when he's on screen.  Unfortunately it isn't often enough.The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  The look is very good.  With the current time frame the film is purposefully muted, some of which is that the locations are literally bombed out.  The country has been destroyed.  In the flashbacks, the colors are more vibrant.  In all cases the detail is excellent.  Likewise the audio is excellent.  Using a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, there is good use of the subs as well as some nifty surround use (McArthur's airplane landing).  Otherwise the dialog is clear and consistent throughout.  Extras include a voice over commentary by the director and producer, some deleted scenes,a ""making of"" featurette, a gallery of photos of the real people in the story and a trailer.",2,(BLU RAY REVIEW) An unsuccessful conflation of history and romance,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,2948,"['movie', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'film', 'attempts', 'conflate', 'epic', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'romantic', 'drama', 'suspect', 'lure', 'plenty', 'rationale', ""n't"", 'Here', 'example', 'how', ""n't"", 'Based', 'book', 'Hiro', 'Okamoto', 'written', 'Vera', 'Blasi', 'David', 'Klass', 'director', 'Peter', 'Webber', 'audience', 'inner', 'workings', 'General', 'Douglas', 'McArthur', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'was', 'assigned', 'President', 'Truman', 'rebuild', 'Japan', 'couple', 'A-bombs', 'destroyed', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki.One', 'key', 'elements', 'McArthur', 'plan', 'yet', 'be', 'decided', 'Specifically', 'what', 'do', 'Emperor', 'Hirohito', 'Takataro', 'Kataoka', 'was', 'considered', 'god', 'Japanese', 'was', 'concern', 'making', 'martyr', 'was', 'tried', 'convicted', 'war', 'crimes', 'Still', 'what', 'was', 'role', 'attack', 'America', 'McArthur', 'assigned', 'task', 'investigating', 'Hirohito', 'role', 'Brig', 'General', 'Bonner', 'Fellers', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'who', 'had', 'lived', 'briefly', 'Japan', 'had', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Aya', 'who', 'met', 'college', 'when', 'was', 'studying', 'America.About', 'time', 'viewer', 'interested', 'crime', 'procedural', 'Fellers', 'drifts', 'off', 'dreamland', 'get', 'flashback', 'point', 'relationship', 'Aya', 'also', 'determined', 'find', 'Japan', 'least', 'what', 'happened', 'sound', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'do', 'get', 'see', 'side', 'ambitious', 'McArthur', 'who', 'portrayed', 'hard-liner', 'had', 'eyes', 'White', 'House', 'Certainly', 'true', 'most', 'accounts', 'here', 'also', 'expert', 'manipulator', 'process', 'aware', 'future', 'Japan', 'certainly', 'relationship', 'America', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'served', 'allowing', 'Emperor', 'remain', 'figurehead', 'most', 'likely', 'was', 'anyway', 'Not', 'wanting', 'appear', 'soft', 'however', 'Feller', 'empathy', 'Japanese', 'likely', 'recommendation', 'would', 'make', 'position', 'more', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'stalls', 'when', 'Fellers', 'kick', 'when', 'out', 'searching', 'Aya', 'Fox', ""n't"", 'help', 'things', 'much', 'wooden', 'performance', 'Jones', 'certainly', 'film', 'when', 'screen', ""n't"", 'often', 'enough.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', '1080p', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.35:1', 'look', 'very', 'good', 'current', 'time', 'frame', 'film', 'purposefully', 'muted', 'locations', 'are', 'literally', 'bombed', 'out', 'country', 'been', 'destroyed', 'flashbacks', 'colors', 'are', 'more', 'vibrant', 'cases', 'detail', 'excellent', 'Likewise', 'audio', 'excellent', 'Using', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'good', 'use', 'subs', 'as', 'well', 'nifty', 'surround', 'use', 'McArthur', 'airplane', 'landing', 'Otherwise', 'dialog', 'clear', 'consistent', 'Extras', 'include', 'voice', 'commentary', 'director', 'producer', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making', 'featurette', 'gallery', 'photos', 'real', 'people', 'story', 'trailer']",N/A

1652741,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00CZB9BCU,Paul Allaer,"[181, 190]","""Emperor"" (2013 release; 98 min.) brings the true story of how General/Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces MacArthur (played here by Tommy Lee Jones) was sent to Japan following Japan's surrender to end WWII, to assess which top ranking officials from Japan, including possibly Emperor Hirohito, should be brought to justice and stand trial. MacArthur enlistens the help of General Fellers (played by Matthew Fox) for the actual investigations, focusing on the Emperor, the Prime Minister and a few other top Ministers. The problem is that Washington demands a conclusion in only 10 days. The movie's script (based on the book 'His Majesty's Salvation' by Shiro Okamoto) intertwines the political and military aspects with a romantic involvement by Fellers with a Japanese woman whom he gets to know in the 1930s in the US, but who eventually returns to Japan without telling Fellers. Fellers is determined to find her now that he is back in Japan. Will Fellers find his former flame? Will Fellers and MacArthur conclude that the Emperor of Japan must stand trial? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several thoughts: director Peter Webber (best known for directing ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"") does a nice job in bringing the necessary historical background and further perspective, so as to appreciate the task at hand for Fellers and MacArthur. Even though Tokyo was not hit by the atomic bomb, it nevertheless was severely shelled and bombed, and we get a glimpse of what that must've felt like. Tommy Lee Jones does the most with the choice role of MacArthur, including adding some much needed occasional humor. The meeting between MacArthur and the Emperor towards the movie's end is by far THE highlight of the movie. Kudo also to Alex Heffes for scoring a beautiful soundtrack for this movie. Last but not least, at the very end of the movie, we get to see several still pictures of the actual events, which really add to the poignancy of the movie.The screening I saw this at in my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati a few months ago was (to my surprise) very well attended and tilting heavily towards the seniors, so this movie might have some legs on DVD (it played quite some weeks in the theatre), not unlike that other recent historical movie ""Hyde Park on Hudson"".

The story of Bonner Fellers was one part of this process and it is told as a part of this movie.  Yet I, for one, found it was  a distraction.  I would much rather have seen a closer focus on MacArthur and his struggle to make his occupation start off on a satisfactory basis.  Fellers had a role in this but I think the romantic aspect, much of it contrived it seems, undermines the larger story of what was taking place in those first few weeks.Some aspects of the movie`s historical basis are done well.  The drive from Atsugi to Yokohama is shown well, with the road lined on both sides by Japanese soldiers who about face when MacArthur's fleet of cars drive by, as a sign of respect.  The meeting between MacArthur and Emperor Showa is well done.  The efforts to either prosecute or ignore the Emperor`s role in the events leading up to the start of the war and then its conduct, is a key aspect that could have done with greater detail.As entertainment the movie does it well but as to delivering historical accuracy to a period in US-Japanese relations, it does little to raise the level of understanding that period.

Should he also prosecute the Emperor Hirohito and if he does what will be the aftermath?  Of course the citizens of the United States would love to see him convicted and hung, but Japanese citizens will have even more chaos then the incinerated cities that are left.  Besides that, the Communists will come in and take over.  A young Brigadier General by the name of Bonner Fellers is charged with finding all the war criminals and also investigating the role of the Emperor in the bombing of Pearl Harbor and whether he was actually in control.The other part of this story deals with Bonner Feller's relationship with a young Japanese woman who he met at college.  Actually he attended the college in 1916, before he went to the US Military Academy at West Point, so the dates seem a little bit off.  There are these continuous flashbacks to their days together in America and then in Japan before the war.  It's during this phase that Feller's tries to absorb as much as he can about Japanese culture and writes a paper on the psychological mind of a Japanese soldier.To me this whole movie dealt more with this relationship than it did with trying to reconcile what was needed to do to bring justice to war criminals, put some kind of order into a devastated country, and determine if the Emperor should still stay in power.I was expecting more of an emphasis and presence of Douglas MacArthur then General Fellers.  That didn't seem to happen.  Tommy Lee Jones, as much as he is able to portray a lot of different characters, really didn't hit the mark as the famous, corncob pipe smoking hero.

Kirby,"[2, 3]","This movie tells the story of the US Army JAG teams trying to put together the Pacific theater war crimes indictments in the first month after the Japanese surrender. It centers on the Tokyo HQ team investigating the question as whether the Emperor of Japan should be tried for allowing the Imperial General Staff a free hand in the attack at Pearl Harbor and ensuing events during the war. Movie plot centers on two major American characters, US General Fellows leading the inquest team concerning the Emperor; and General Douglas MacArthur micro-managing his work as well as establishing the occupation forces in Japan in the fall of 1945. Success of the Occupation will balance on the situation regarding the Emperor. This is all interesting, and as we have learned since 1945, this was a difficult situation. Script is based on true events and actual people. Interesting...but hardly exciting. We follow flashbacks in the life of General Fellows as he recalls falling in love with a Japanese woman he met in university and again in subsequent pre-war trips to Japan, and as he attempts to find her again in the bombed-out chaos of 1945 Japan.While the movie is interesting and watchable, the viuewer will have to endure some of the most &#34;unique mis)castings of any movie in a long time!  Matthew Fox ( LOST) as a US Army  general...hmmm. OK, possible...he's in his early 30s now and there were 23 and 24 year old generals in rare cases. Works as 50% of the love interest...and I sort of suspect he owns a share of the film..  Tommy Lee Jones as General of the Army Douglas MacArthur...now that's a bit of a strech to me.. Imperious, aloof, tall, calculating, Virginia &#34;gentlemanly, were all terms used (among others) to describe MacArthur. Best played on the screen by Gregory Peck in 1977's &#34;MacArthur&#34;, becoming a virtual clone to the real guy. Sir Laurence Oliver did Doug once, not too well, in the movie &#34;Inchon&#34;. OK, we get Tommy Lee Jones, Arkansas accent and all. Costuming did it's part, the uniform and crushed cap, corn-cob pipe, and all that...on a short guy who looked nothing like the real guy...sorta reminded me of General MacArthur as he would have been played by Yosemite Sam! Best casting was of the beautiful actress who played Aya, the lost love of Fox' character. All Japanese actors were perfectly cast as their actual counterparts in history.Sets were fine, locations in Japan and rural New Zealand (as parts of rural Japan). Vehicles were spot-on. Even a background Japanese Chi-ha tank. Japanese speak Japanese with English subtitles 90% of the movie. I wish the subtitles would have been used when the Japanese spoke English, as many were so thickly accented it was difficult to understandexcept in context.I wouls recommend this to a person interested in the history presented.

This film - a joint Japanese/American production - is about the beginning of MacArthur's reign as Supreme Commander; and how he, with the assistance of his staff, sorts out the status of Emperor Hirohito. The title of the movie, I assume is in reference to Hirohito; but it could just as easily apply to MacArthur's benevolent dictatorship. While Tommy Lee Jones gets lead billing as MacArthur - and he performs brilliantly, Texas accent and all - the real star of the film is Matthew Fox, as MacArthur's staff assistant, Brigadier Gen Bonner Fellers. It was Fellers who led the investigation into the Emperor's role in the War; and he put together the position papers that MacArthur used to exonerate Hirohito...at least sufficiently to allow him to remain as emperor. Fellers' knowledge of Japan and its people was instrumental in his investigation and in his findings. And Fellers did have a pre-war romance with a Japanese girl; but the romance with Aya (played beautifully by Eriko Hatsune) is fictionalized in the film...for dramatic effect I'm sure.

They hardly mention any of the Japanese war atrocities and focus on the Japanese as victims of horrid American bombing.

I mean, does that justify what they did?The movie also cited the reason for the Japanese attacking the Americans was because of the oil embargo imposed by FDR. Nowhere did they mention the reasons for doing so. FDR wanted to force the Japanese out of China peacefully by starving their war machine, not the population. This is but just one example of the blatant attempts of this movie to omit any sense of balance and just present a pro Japanese view of the war.By the end of the movie, they indicate that the Protagonist was demoted from Brig General to Colonel. No reason was given for his demotion and the implication was because of his recommendation that the Japanese Emperor not be tried for his war crimes. This is another blatant attempt to slant things by omission.  After WW2, 212 generals were demoted because they were raised in rank temporarily during the war. The same position the protagonist was. His rank was temporary.A total waste of time imho.

It falls to Fellers to perform the laborious task of piecing together the evidence both for and against the leader, interviewing those who were closest to him (those who haven't already died or committed suicide, that is) as a means of arriving at the verdict.Directed by Peter Webber, ""Emperor"" could easily have become a dry and tedious exercise in historical re-creation were it not for the fact that the script by Vera Blasi and David Klass continually raises a host of thorny ethical issues along the way. Are the Allies being hypocritical for condemning Japan for its imperialistic ambitions when the Brits and Americans essentially led the way in such behavior? Will hanging the Emperor cause a revolt among the masses of loyal Japanese citizens whom the Americans are trying to win over to their side? Or does justice demand that Hirohito pay for his crimes at the end of a rope, or would such an outcome merely be giving into a need for revenge on the part of the American people, an act, by the way, that wouldn't exactly hurt MacArthur's political ambitions back home (we are told he dearly wants to become President)?Throughout the course of his investigation, Fellers is forced to find a way to deal with a culture and a people that, while they may appear modern on the surface, have their roots planted firmly in the ancient values of loyalty and shame.Even Feller's rather cliched romance with a Japanese woman before the war nicely contributes to the themes the movie is exploring.",4,Thoughtful examination of WWII history,1380240000,"09 27, 2013",2013,1957,"['History', 'buffs', 'should', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'time', 'Emperor', 'unusually', 'interesting', 'look', 'Japanese/American', 'relations', 'aftermath', 'World', 'War', 'II.Matthew', 'Fox', 'Lost', 'fame', 'Brigadier', 'General', 'Bonner', 'Fellers', 'man', 'whom', 'General', 'MacArthur', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'personally', 'put', 'charge', 'determining', 'not', 'disgraced', 'Emperor', 'Hirohito', 'should', 'be', 'tried', 'war', 'criminal', 'i.e.', 'did', 'order', 'sign', 'off', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Fellers', 'perform', 'laborious', 'task', 'piecing', 'together', 'evidence', 'leader', 'interviewing', 'who', 'were', 'closest', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'died', 'committed', 'suicide', 'means', 'arriving', 'verdict.Directed', 'Peter', 'Webber', 'Emperor', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'become', 'dry', 'tedious', 'exercise', 'historical', 're-creation', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'script', 'Vera', 'Blasi', 'David', 'Klass', 'continually', 'host', 'thorny', 'ethical', 'issues', 'way', 'Are', 'Allies', 'being', 'hypocritical', 'condemning', 'Japan', 'imperialistic', 'ambitions', 'when', 'Brits', 'Americans', 'essentially', 'led', 'way', 'such', 'behavior', 'Will', 'hanging', 'Emperor', 'cause', 'revolt', 'masses', 'loyal', 'Japanese', 'citizens', 'whom', 'Americans', 'are', 'trying', 'win', 'side', 'justice', 'demand', 'Hirohito', 'pay', 'crimes', 'end', 'rope', 'would', 'such', 'outcome', 'merely', 'be', 'giving', 'need', 'revenge', 'part', 'American', 'people', 'act', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'hurt', 'MacArthur', 'political', 'ambitions', 'back', 'home', 'are', 'told', 'dearly', 'become', 'President', 'course', 'investigation', 'Fellers', 'forced', 'find', 'way', 'deal', 'culture', 'people', 'may', 'appear', 'modern', 'surface', 'have', 'roots', 'planted', 'firmly', 'ancient', 'values', 'loyalty', 'shame.Even', 'Feller', 'rather', 'cliched', 'romance', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'war', 'nicely', 'themes', 'movie', 'exploring']",N/A

I love historical dramas, to be able to get an idea of what it must have been like to live through important times/events in history. That being said I found this movie to be a bit of a let down. While the movie is based on actual events it takes far too much creative license with the story. One the biggest being Fellers had NO hand in picking out targets to bomb on mainland Japan (that would have been under the control of General Hap Arnold not MacArthur), he spent the war as a military attach&eacute; and psychological warfare planner and was Chief of Psychological Operations under MacArthur.The fictional love story between Bonner Fellers and Aya Shimada (who is loosely based on Yuri Watanabe, who was a friend he met in college in 1914) completely bogs down the movie. Instead of the fictional Fellers wandering Japan romantically chasing Aya right before the war as the movie portrays, what the movie doesn't tell us is that Fellers was actually married (in 1925 and not to Yuri) and was a father. Also when he did visit Japan in the pre-war years his wife usually accompanied him. Had the focus been solely on his investigations, dealings with Japanese political leaders and generals rather than wasting time with the fictional love angle the movie would have been much more interesting. Also, Fellers sneaking out at night, eating/drinking in the bombed out neighborhoods and finally getting beaten up by some local Japanese thugs was simply ridiculous. I found the best parts of the movie to be his dealings with Tojo and near the end when MacArthur and The Emperor finally meet.Acting is not bad, it is interesting to see MacArthur with his gigantic publicity hound ego, it's just too bad the story was so disappointing. And the ending notes bothered me, when it said Fellers was demoted by Eisenhower after the war. As usually happens when a war ends many of the Senior Officers are lowered in rank and he was just one of 212 Generals that were reduced in rank. To make is sound like he was singled out by Eisenhower and demoted is utter rubbish.

Indeed the music of the film was an unexpected surprise in that it seemed to sum up many of the themes in the film: conflict, world/war-weariness. love, and loss.The historical period and context involving the Emperor of Japan in the period immediately following the end of World War II hostilities with Japan is not one I've seen in film or read about before.  However, in many ways it is as crucial to understanding the history which preceded and followed it as the event leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  A full treatment of this period would require a mini-series to adequately cover it, but this movie does a decent job of covering a key part of it:  what was the extent of the emperor's involvement in the decision to launch the war against the United States?A key subplot in the movie is a love story between one of the generals serving General MacArthur and a Japanese woman in years prior to the war.  It is told through flashbacks spread throughout the movie, but it is effective in capturing one of the key themes of the movie, that of a conflicted relationship between two countries.  Some have found the love story to be a distraction, but I found it instead to be integral to the whole movie.  Though told in a shorter manner than it could have been, the love story helps to convey the sense of what was lost in the war:  a beautiful country and people that were swept into the chaos of events larger than them, resulting in great destruction to themselves and others.  There are other ways that this could have been told, but the romantic relationship between these two characters quickly grounds the viewers in the period and brings a sense of reality to events and their consequences.I would have enjoyed seeing either the love story or the historical events told in a longer story format like a mini-series, but that would have changed some of the themes of the film.  Taken as-is, it is a fine movie that quickly transports one back in time to a key period in history and leaves us wondering a bit what the world might have been like if these two countries and cultures had been able to find another way through the conflict of their time.

Unfortunately, Tommy Lee Jones is only second-billed and his screen time is pretty limited, as the ""Emperor"" mainly follows the story of a U.S. Army officer Bonner Frank Fellers (Matthew Fox), who is ordered by MacArthur to investigate whether or not Emperor Hirohito should be tried as a war criminal. And he has to do it in ten days.So part of the film unfolds like a political thriller, where Fellers meets several key persons before and during the war like Hideki Tojo (Shohei Hino) and Fumimaro Konoe (Masatoshi Nakamura). This story, set in post-war Tokyo, is interspersed with flashback to his pre-war romance with a Japanese woman Aya Shimada (Eriko Hatsune). Fellers, who once wrote an article about Japanese soldiers with a help from Aya and General Kajima (Toshiyuki Nishida), attempts to locate the missing Aya, with an interpreter Takahashi (Masayoshi Haneda).Bonner Frank Fellers is not a fictional character. In fact, most characters are real-life persons, including Teizaburo Sekiya (Isao Natsuyagi), who is the grandfather of one of the movie's producers Yoko Narahashi. The film's premise provides a great opportunity for absorbing historical drama, but director and writers Vera Blasi and David Klass fail to make a full use of it. Actors all did a great job, but none of them is given enough time to impress us as fleshed-out characters.According to the film, MacArthur and Fellers played an important role in this decisive moment in modern Japanese history, but the film spends so much time following the fictional love story, which has nothing to do with their decision making. Some interesting episodes (like Kyujo Incident) are treated cursorily. ""Emperor"" knows what it wants to do. Sadly it does not seem to know how.",3,Histrical Drama with Not Enough History,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,1937,"['Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'General', 'Douglas', 'MacArthur', 'Emperor', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Webber', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'seasoned', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'excellent', 'job', 'usual', 'Unfortunately', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'only', 'second-billed', 'screen', 'time', 'pretty', 'limited', 'Emperor', 'mainly', 'story', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'officer', 'Bonner', 'Frank', 'Fellers', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'who', 'ordered', 'MacArthur', 'investigate', 'not', 'Emperor', 'Hirohito', 'should', 'be', 'tried', 'war', 'criminal', 'do', 'ten', 'days.So', 'part', 'film', 'unfolds', 'political', 'thriller', 'where', 'Fellers', 'several', 'key', 'persons', 'war', 'Hideki', 'Tojo', 'Shohei', 'Hino', 'Fumimaro', 'Konoe', 'Masatoshi', 'Nakamura', 'story', 'set', 'post-war', 'Tokyo', 'interspersed', 'flashback', 'pre-war', 'romance', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'Aya', 'Shimada', 'Eriko', 'Hatsune', 'Fellers', 'who', 'once', 'wrote', 'article', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'help', 'Aya', 'General', 'Kajima', 'Toshiyuki', 'Nishida', 'locate', 'missing', 'Aya', 'interpreter', 'Takahashi', 'Masayoshi', 'Haneda', '.Bonner', 'Frank', 'Fellers', 'not', 'fictional', 'character', 'fact', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'real-life', 'persons', 'including', 'Teizaburo', 'Sekiya', 'Isao', 'Natsuyagi', 'who', 'grandfather', 'one', 'movie', 'producers', 'Yoko', 'Narahashi', 'film', 'premise', 'great', 'opportunity', 'absorbing', 'historical', 'drama', 'director', 'writers', 'Vera', 'Blasi', 'David', 'Klass', 'fail', 'make', 'full', 'use', 'Actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'none', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'impress', 'fleshed-out', 'characters.According', 'film', 'MacArthur', 'Fellers', 'played', 'important', 'role', 'decisive', 'moment', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'history', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'following', 'fictional', 'love', 'story', 'nothing', 'do', 'decision', 'making', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'Kyujo', 'Incident', 'are', 'treated', 'cursorily', 'Emperor', 'what', 'do', 'Sadly', 'not', 'seem', 'know', 'how']",N/A
