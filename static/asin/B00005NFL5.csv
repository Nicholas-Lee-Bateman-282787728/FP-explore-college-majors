667670,AK2Q7ML2RANDN,B00005NFL5,A. Eby,"[4, 5]","&quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; is one of the most affecting films I've seen in a long time.  It is spare and cruel, and really has no resolution which often drives moviegoers crazy; I thought it was masterful.  I saw it over a week ago and I'm still thinking about it, which speaks to how powerful it is.  I won't go into plot details - you should see it yourself!  But I found none of its explicitness gratuitous in the least.  I thought it was a very honest portrait of the pain and anger of an individual.  I wouldn't really say it was about sadomasochism, because I think it's much deeper than that.  It's exposing, in a painfully raw way, the torment of a particular person.  I imagine this film will resound with two kinds of people - cinephiles focused on the artistry of the film and those who identify, on a personal level, with pain.  For those, Isabelle Huppert expresses more truth in the movement of an eyebrow than in just about anything else I've seen.  If you know what you're getting into, &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; can be an amazing experience.",5,Brutally Brilliant,1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,1065,"['quot', 'Piano', 'Teacher', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'affecting', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'spare', 'cruel', 'really', 'resolution', 'often', 'moviegoers', 'crazy', 'thought', 'was', 'masterful', 'saw', 'over', 'week', 'ago', ""'m"", 'still', 'thinking', 'how', 'powerful', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'details', 'should', 'see', 'found', 'none', 'explicitness', 'gratuitous', 'least', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'honest', 'portrait', 'pain', 'anger', 'individual', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'was', 'sadomasochism', 'think', 'much', 'deeper', 'exposing', 'painfully', 'raw', 'way', 'torment', 'particular', 'person', 'imagine', 'film', 'will', 'resound', 'two', 'kinds', 'people', 'cinephiles', 'focused', 'artistry', 'film', 'who', 'identify', 'personal', 'level', 'pain', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'more', 'truth', 'movement', 'eyebrow', 'just', 'anything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'quot', 'Piano', 'Teacher', 'quot', 'can', 'be', 'amazing', 'experience']",La Pianiste
667671,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B00005NFL5,Amanda,"[11, 24]","Yikes. Where do I begin? Usually, I love watching foreign films, because they tend to rely more on telling a good story rather than special effects and big names. But I'm sorry to have to say that I was very disappointed with this one. ""The Piano Teacher"" revolves around a sexually repressed piano teacher who never smiles, and who is very icy with everyone, including a young man who, for some odd reason, claims to love her. She still lives with her nosy, sometimes intolerable mother in a small apartment, and sometimes you get the impression they hate each other. This woman also likes to go to porn shops to watch porn videos, and she likes to watch young couples getting hot-and-heavy at drive-in movies. A lot of this film's content is racy... Even though some scenes are, well, deserving of being un-rated, they are not done pornographically. After all, this is an artsy French film. It wasn't so much the racy content that bothered me, but more of how it was executed. By the end of the film, I was frustrated. The piano teacher treats this young man horribly, and freaks him out when she gives him a list of violent things she wants him to do to her doing sex. He, of course, isn't amused by this, but I spent the entire film wondering why he even loved her in the first place.I kind of wanted to give this film one star, because I found a lot of it to be very disturbing. However, I can't because the movie is not a bad movie. The acting is superb, and the story, though not my cup of tea, is still a powerful, tragic story of a woman with some real problems. And of course, the music is great. So while it is not for everyone, it is an okay foreign film, so long as you're not looking for a feel-good one.",3,A Little Off-Key,1036627200,"11 7, 2002",2002,1718,"['Yikes', 'Where', 'do', 'begin', 'Usually', 'love', 'watching', 'foreign', 'films', 'tend', 'rely', 'more', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'rather', 'special', 'effects', 'big', 'names', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'one', 'Piano', 'Teacher', 'sexually', 'repressed', 'piano', 'teacher', 'who', 'never', 'who', 'very', 'icy', 'everyone', 'including', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'odd', 'reason', 'love', 'still', 'nosy', 'sometimes', 'intolerable', 'mother', 'small', 'apartment', 'sometimes', 'get', 'impression', 'hate', 'other', 'woman', 'also', 'go', 'porn', 'shops', 'watch', 'porn', 'videos', 'watch', 'young', 'couples', 'getting', 'hot-and-heavy', 'drive-in', 'movies', 'lot', 'film', 'content', 'racy', 'Even', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'deserving', 'being', 'un-rated', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'pornographically', 'artsy', 'French', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'racy', 'content', 'bothered', 'more', 'how', 'was', 'executed', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'frustrated', 'piano', 'teacher', 'young', 'man', 'horribly', 'out', 'when', 'list', 'violent', 'things', 'do', 'her', 'doing', 'sex', 'course', ""n't"", 'amused', 'spent', 'entire', 'film', 'wondering', 'why', 'even', 'loved', 'first', 'place.I', 'kind', 'wanted', 'give', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'found', 'lot', 'be', 'very', 'disturbing', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'because', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'acting', 'superb', 'story', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'still', 'powerful', 'tragic', 'story', 'woman', 'real', 'problems', 'course', 'music', 'great', 'So', 'not', 'everyone', 'okay', 'foreign', 'film', 'so', 'long', ""'re"", 'not', 'looking', 'feel-good', 'one']",La Pianiste

You will have seen words like, dark, brooding, disturbing thrown around like confetti, when in truth the movie simply does not deliver. What leaves an sour taste in the mouth is not the disturbed main character, nor the semi graphic sexual scenes, but mainly a very very compelling film that ends abruptly, if not predictably leaving the viewer feeling cheated.

667673,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,B00005NFL5,Amy Lynn,"[1, 2]","Sad in a sick twisted way. Most depressing? maybe. The story is about an uptight sexually repressed piano teacher who lives with her old mother. Also the students she teaches. She has a gift for music and comes off as very intelligent yet emotionless.  One of her younger students falls in love with her, attempts to seduce her and she keeps trying to control him and use him for her warped version of love. I still cant tell if she really loved him or not. It seems the only time she feels anything is when shes inflicting pain on herself or pain on others, even the student who loves her.She makes him do certain things and will deny his affections. Then when he does what she supposedly wanted him to do which was disturbing in itself, she is still just sitting there with no emotion at all. This woman was definitely mentally ill and i tried to understand her character but there wasnt really enough information. I dont want to give away the ending but the whole movie is a downer. I didnt understand what happened at the end or what became of her but i have to say this, this is probably the saddest portrayal of anyone ive ever seen on film. I still cant tell what exactly made her that way. Is she a sociopath? Was she abused at some point?

667674,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005NFL5,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","I happened to watch this film again last night, and I must say that Haneke is a director you have to allow to infiltrate you're way of thinking in order to really understand his work.  He has a very distinct viewpoint and is certainly a visionary, and so his films carry with them hidden layers of emotional confliction that I think are pertinent to appreciating them.  `La Pianiste' is a dark and disturbing film that could be (wrongfully) disregarded as perverse filth, but there is so much more involved here.Throwing this film to the side due to its graphic nature is denying it the admiration it deserves.The film centers around a middle aged woman named Erika Kohut, a piano teacher who lives at home with her mother and secretly hides her own perverse fantasies; sneaking off to buy smut and witness adult films.  Erika is cold and seemingly bitter, a woman who is envious of her young students and strangely dependant on her mother.  Her world is turned upside down when she encounters a young man named Walter Klemmer, an arrogant student with talent who cares little for music itself and more for the attention his hands can get him.  Erika is repulsed yet fascinated to the point where she dares let him inside her head.  Once he has been allowed to see her for who she really is, he challenges her, defying her wishes and showing her that her own desires are not necessarily her own.Michael Haneke is known for his dissection of violence and society.  He is constantly tackling that very subject with fresh ideas that capitalize on his gritty sense of realism and sharp eye for detail.  Taking the lines one crosses, meshing together the emotions of love and hate, Haneke creates a startling character study that leaves the audience much like Erika, and later Walter...Repulsed yet fascinated.The character of Erika Kohut is a mesmerizing one, because she is so easily condemned for her actions and desires but this is a grave misunderstanding of a woman oppressed by her natural surroundings.  She is a woman who has suffered the loss of a father (to insanity) and continually suffers the confinement that comes from paternal control (her mother still treats her as if she were a child).  She is lost within her own passions, surrounded by young students who lack the knowledge she has yet she is grossly aware that they will amount to more than she ever will.  She is insulted by their mediocre talents.  Erika is also alone, lonely within her own view of love.  Being controlled and looked down on, she craves someone to dominate her.  She puts up the air that she is cruel and controlling and domineering, but she is begging, pleading with the world to knock her down.  She has such lack of control within her own life that she needs to control her idea of intimacy.  Finding escape in the voyeuristic engagements suited for a prepubescent boy, Erika taints her own understanding of love by feeding herself the filth propagated by the media.  She becomes her own worst enemy, and thus falls victim to her own carnal misunderstandings.When Walter gives in and `gives her what she wants', it literally destroys her.The film is, on its own, a masterpiece and a force to be reckoned with, but without the dedicated and fearless performance given by Isabelle Huppert the film would not have had nearly the effect needed to sustain it.  When you think of performances that `go there', that really throw caution to the wind and allow themselves to embody a single character, this is one that should instantly come to mind.  Huppert does shy away from the character flaws within Kohut.  She attacks them head on, unlocking this characters inner most secrets and exposing her full frontal for the world to see.  With a performance that includes self mutilation, public urination, proposed incest, total humiliation and twisted perversions of the unmentionable kind, Huppert never flinches in her delivery.  What is even better is that she accompanies each scene with the needed emotional connection to make it wholly believable.  Watching the coldness melt off her face as she faces rejection from the one she has bared her soul too, it is unbelievably sympathetic.  For a woman who has been so rigid and so evil (enough to viciously attack a student) we feel an honest sense of connection to her in that state of turmoil.Huppert is accompanied by some great supporting players, not the least of which is Benoit Magimel, who stuns as her lover Walter.  Witnessing his initial admiration for Erika dissipate into a hysterical observation and then completely manic obsession is brutal and nerve-racking.  Annie Girardot is wickedly amusing as Erika's mother, a woman who is at the center of her daughters own collapse.In the end, `La Pianiste' is NOT a film for everyone, but it is a film that will provoke you and stir you enough to validate its existence.  Michael Haneke is not a shy director, and he does not create fluff films.  His films are meant to be analyzed, studied and discussed.  If you are looking for a film that will challenge you, then this is a film you should witness.",5,Provocative perversions pleading for an audience...,1276646400,"06 16, 2010",2010,5093,"['happened', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'must', 'say', 'Haneke', 'director', 'have', 'allow', 'infiltrate', ""'re"", 'way', 'thinking', 'order', 'really', 'understand', 'work', 'very', 'distinct', 'viewpoint', 'certainly', 'visionary', 'so', 'films', 'carry', 'hidden', 'layers', 'emotional', 'confliction', 'think', 'are', 'pertinent', 'appreciating', 'La', 'Pianiste', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'wrongfully', 'disregarded', 'perverse', 'filth', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'involved', 'here.Throwing', 'film', 'side', 'due', 'graphic', 'nature', 'denying', 'admiration', 'film', 'centers', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'named', 'Erika', 'Kohut', 'piano', 'teacher', 'who', 'home', 'mother', 'secretly', 'own', 'perverse', 'fantasies', 'sneaking', 'buy', 'smut', 'witness', 'adult', 'films', 'Erika', 'cold', 'seemingly', 'bitter', 'woman', 'who', 'envious', 'young', 'students', 'strangely', 'dependant', 'mother', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Walter', 'Klemmer', 'arrogant', 'student', 'talent', 'who', 'little', 'music', 'more', 'attention', 'hands', 'can', 'get', 'Erika', 'repulsed', 'yet', 'fascinated', 'point', 'where', 'let', 'inside', 'head', 'Once', 'been', 'allowed', 'see', 'who', 'really', 'defying', 'wishes', 'showing', 'own', 'desires', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'own.Michael', 'Haneke', 'known', 'dissection', 'violence', 'society', 'constantly', 'tackling', 'very', 'subject', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'capitalize', 'gritty', 'sense', 'realism', 'sharp', 'eye', 'detail', 'Taking', 'lines', 'one', 'crosses', 'meshing', 'together', 'emotions', 'love', 'hate', 'Haneke', 'startling', 'character', 'study', 'audience', 'much', 'Erika', 'later', 'Walter', 'Repulsed', 'yet', 'fascinated.The', 'character', 'Erika', 'Kohut', 'mesmerizing', 'one', 'so', 'easily', 'condemned', 'actions', 'desires', 'grave', 'misunderstanding', 'woman', 'oppressed', 'natural', 'surroundings', 'woman', 'who', 'suffered', 'loss', 'father', 'insanity', 'continually', 'confinement', 'paternal', 'control', 'mother', 'still', 'were', 'child', 'lost', 'own', 'passions', 'surrounded', 'young', 'students', 'who', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'yet', 'grossly', 'aware', 'will', 'amount', 'more', 'ever', 'will', 'insulted', 'mediocre', 'talents', 'Erika', 'also', 'alone', 'lonely', 'own', 'view', 'love', 'Being', 'controlled', 'looked', 'down', 'someone', 'dominate', 'up', 'air', 'cruel', 'controlling', 'domineering', 'begging', 'pleading', 'world', 'knock', 'down', 'such', 'lack', 'control', 'own', 'life', 'control', 'idea', 'intimacy', 'Finding', 'escape', 'voyeuristic', 'engagements', 'suited', 'prepubescent', 'boy', 'Erika', 'own', 'understanding', 'love', 'feeding', 'filth', 'propagated', 'media', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'thus', 'victim', 'own', 'carnal', 'misunderstandings.When', 'Walter', 'what', 'literally', 'her.The', 'film', 'own', 'masterpiece', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'dedicated', 'fearless', 'performance', 'given', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'nearly', 'effect', 'needed', 'sustain', 'When', 'think', 'performances', 'go', 'really', 'throw', 'caution', 'wind', 'allow', 'embody', 'single', 'character', 'one', 'should', 'instantly', 'come', 'mind', 'Huppert', 'shy', 'away', 'character', 'flaws', 'Kohut', 'head', 'unlocking', 'characters', 'inner', 'most', 'secrets', 'exposing', 'full', 'frontal', 'world', 'see', 'performance', 'self', 'mutilation', 'public', 'urination', 'proposed', 'incest', 'total', 'humiliation', 'twisted', 'perversions', 'unmentionable', 'kind', 'Huppert', 'never', 'delivery', 'What', 'even', 'better', 'scene', 'needed', 'emotional', 'connection', 'make', 'wholly', 'believable', 'Watching', 'coldness', 'melt', 'off', 'face', 'rejection', 'one', 'bared', 'soul', 'too', 'unbelievably', 'sympathetic', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'so', 'rigid', 'so', 'evil', 'enough', 'viciously', 'attack', 'student', 'feel', 'honest', 'sense', 'connection', 'state', 'turmoil.Huppert', 'accompanied', 'great', 'supporting', 'players', 'not', 'least', 'Benoit', 'Magimel', 'who', 'lover', 'Walter', 'Witnessing', 'initial', 'admiration', 'Erika', 'dissipate', 'hysterical', 'observation', 'then', 'completely', 'manic', 'obsession', 'brutal', 'nerve-racking', 'Annie', 'Girardot', 'wickedly', 'amusing', 'Erika', 'mother', 'woman', 'who', 'center', 'daughters', 'own', 'collapse.In', 'end', 'La', 'Pianiste', 'NOT', 'film', 'everyone', 'film', 'will', 'provoke', 'stir', 'enough', 'validate', 'existence', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'not', 'shy', 'director', 'not', 'create', 'fluff', 'films', 'films', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'analyzed', 'studied', 'discussed', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'will', 'challenge', 'then', 'film', 'should', 'witness']",La Pianiste
667675,A3H2KLAV0VLQ0K,B00005NFL5,B26354,"[3, 4]","Superbly acted by Huppert, but couldn't get past the painful granularity of a character that leaves the viewer no choice but to despise her. Her passive-aggressive sadism towards others is born out of the hatred she has for herself. Among the physical abuse she commits against herself in various ways, she also commits the worst kind of betrayal - a teacher who hates her own pupils to the point of committing acts of violence against them - no one is safe around her - she hates all equally. She pours broken glass into a student's coat pocket out of some senseless deranged jealousy, thus completely destroying that student's hope for a career as a pianist. As equally as she doles out the psychological and physical abuse (there is a revolting scene of some sort of bizarre sexual attack she commits against her own mother, whom she sleeps with in the same bed), she also demands to be abused. She asks her student-boyfriend to beat her (and he obliges, seemingly with some regret) but that can't compare with how much she hates herself.Instead of caring about this character, I found myself disgusted by her (mostly because of her own weakness and unwillingness to change). This woman puts on an air of strength, stoicism, and intelligence, but it is really just a cover for her weakness as a person devoid of any conscious. She is too weak to break the sick relationship she has with her dominating mother, so her life is a gradual escalation of a psychosis that she allows to destroy her. She is a dangerous, sociopathic individual with no hope, so the entire film becomes a disturbing examination of that, and doesn't offer anything else.",1,The Piano Teacher - A Study in Self-Hatred,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,1646,"['Superbly', 'acted', 'Huppert', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'painful', 'granularity', 'character', 'viewer', 'choice', 'despise', 'passive-aggressive', 'sadism', 'towards', 'others', 'born', 'hatred', 'physical', 'abuse', 'various', 'ways', 'also', 'worst', 'kind', 'betrayal', 'teacher', 'who', 'own', 'pupils', 'point', 'committing', 'acts', 'violence', 'one', 'safe', 'equally', 'broken', 'glass', 'student', 'coat', 'pocket', 'senseless', 'deranged', 'jealousy', 'thus', 'completely', 'destroying', 'student', 'hope', 'career', 'pianist', 'As', 'equally', 'out', 'psychological', 'physical', 'abuse', 'revolting', 'scene', 'sort', 'bizarre', 'sexual', 'attack', 'own', 'mother', 'whom', 'same', 'bed', 'also', 'be', 'abused', 'student-boyfriend', 'beat', 'seemingly', 'regret', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'how', 'much', 'herself.Instead', 'caring', 'character', 'found', 'disgusted', 'mostly', 'own', 'weakness', 'unwillingness', 'change', 'woman', 'air', 'strength', 'stoicism', 'intelligence', 'really', 'just', 'cover', 'weakness', 'person', 'devoid', 'conscious', 'too', 'weak', 'break', 'sick', 'relationship', 'dominating', 'mother', 'life', 'gradual', 'escalation', 'psychosis', 'destroy', 'dangerous', 'sociopathic', 'individual', 'hope', 'entire', 'film', 'disturbing', 'examination', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'else']",La Pianiste

Lo, they have turned this movie into a decent sized hit as a result. THE PIANO TEACHER is actually the best SPCS publicized movie I've seen to date. Brilliantly directed by Michael Heneke, who scripted from Elfiede Jelinek's novel.Huppert plays Professor Erika Kohut; a cold, brutal, seemingly prudent piano teacher at a prestious music academy. But behind her icy facade lies an obsession with pornography and sadomasochistic sex. When a gifted young piano student (Benoit Magimel) comes under Erika's tutelage, he doesn't play to her impossibly high standards and as a result bears the brunt of her wrath but he soon finds himself falling in love with the professor who just seems to enjoy playing mind games with him. Though unknown to him Erika is gradually losing control under the influence of her domineering mother.THE PIANO TEACHER is exceptionally well photographed with a complex structure and a brilliant perfomance from Huppert (In fact you easily forget she IS just an actress playing a part).There are some rather grim scenes including plenty of S&M;, a funny drive-in theatre peeing scene and Erika putting broken glass in a girls coat pocket. I'm not sure if this will get a DVD release in NZ, but it deserves to. THE PIANO TEACHER is a masterwork that commands a wide audience, and it was probably only because of its content that it was overlooked by the Academy.

667677,A34K8D262NZQJF,B00005NFL5,blackholesun,"[2, 5]","I like dark movies. This movie. Is a dark movie. I may have given the review just 3 stars but it is only for the many, many questions I had at the end of the film. The one thing I have trouble understanding is the true reason of why the piano teacher (Isabelle Huppert) is the way she is. You can say out of nowhere, oh she was molested or raped when she was young or something but the movie never ever shows any flashbacks or reveal any true thoughts or opinions of her nature from her own point of view.

667678,A1THJ5GJF9NLCS,B00005NFL5,"BLee ""bpslee""","[0, 1]","I entirely agree with the previous reviewers. The actors and actresses are of the best choice. The characters are so well portrayed and the settings are so well depicted. The overall effects are quite convincing. It's defintely shocking and at least commercially this film is a success.The choice of Schubert's music at least serves two points. First, Schubert's music is one of the saddest in the history of music, it's the music of the loniest pilgrim. Second, contrary to Beethoven's music, which is so clear and straight forward, the changes of moods in Schubert's music are so sudden and so abundant and that it is often difficult to follow, and so are the turns and twists in this story.A general survey of the life of the pianists would making this story more convincing. An American critized Kissin for knowing nothing but playing on the piano from day to night all his life; Glenn Gould shut himself up in front of the piano since and before his pre-teens; Allica de Larrocha's mother begged her daughter to ""live her life"" (Allica's word), instead of sacrifying it to the piano; MargaretvArgerich's ""fiance"" (Margaret's own word) was the piano. The life of a musician destined to become a concert pianist could be very lonely ( and boring )to the point of abnormality unless you really enjoy it, or unless you can balance it with sufficient chamber music or the like. Yet, competition is so keen that 99 concert pianists out of a hundred would advise against a cereer of a concert pianist unless one is exceptionally talented.Obviously the heroine here as ""a piano teacher"", despite her sacrifice, didn't quite make it as a concert pianist. Her mother, so possessive and dominating, furiously urged her to earn more money to buy a flat etc. Furthermore, the family has a history of mental problem; and her mother sharing the bed with her even when she was forty something. Needless to say, this case is by no means a norm yet it is not at all unconvincing. And having been to the concert hall where this film was shot, it appears to me strikingly sad and true.What is controversial though is the deliberate distortion of the sound of all music, be it's piano or vocal music, so that there is NO MUSIC LEFT AT ALL, ONLY NOISES. Perhaps this serves the main theme of the story better, delivering a greater impact upon the audience. And yet on the other hand, one also wonders if that is really necessary, whether a mix of bitteress & sweetness would be more impressing.",4,A Commercial Success to Say the Very Least,1086998400,"06 12, 2004",2004,2477,"['entirely', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'best', 'choice', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'portrayed', 'settings', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'depicted', 'overall', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'convincing', 'defintely', 'shocking', 'least', 'commercially', 'film', 'success.The', 'choice', 'Schubert', 'music', 'least', 'serves', 'two', 'points', 'First', 'Schubert', 'music', 'one', 'saddest', 'history', 'music', 'music', 'loniest', 'pilgrim', 'Second', 'contrary', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'so', 'clear', 'straight', 'forward', 'changes', 'moods', 'Schubert', 'music', 'are', 'so', 'sudden', 'so', 'abundant', 'often', 'difficult', 'follow', 'so', 'are', 'turns', 'twists', 'story.A', 'general', 'survey', 'life', 'pianists', 'would', 'making', 'story', 'more', 'convincing', 'American', 'critized', 'Kissin', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'playing', 'piano', 'day', 'night', 'life', 'Glenn', 'Gould', 'shut', 'up', 'front', 'piano', 'pre-teens', 'Allica', 'Larrocha', 'mother', 'begged', 'daughter', 'live', 'life', 'Allica', 'word', 'instead', 'sacrifying', 'piano', 'MargaretvArgerich', 'fiance', 'Margaret', 'own', 'word', 'was', 'piano', 'life', 'musician', 'destined', 'become', 'concert', 'pianist', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'lonely', 'boring', 'point', 'abnormality', 'really', 'enjoy', 'can', 'balance', 'sufficient', 'chamber', 'music', 'like', 'competition', 'so', 'keen', '99', 'concert', 'pianists', 'hundred', 'would', 'advise', 'cereer', 'concert', 'pianist', 'one', 'exceptionally', 'talented.Obviously', 'heroine', 'here', 'piano', 'teacher', 'sacrifice', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'concert', 'pianist', 'mother', 'so', 'possessive', 'dominating', 'furiously', 'urged', 'earn', 'more', 'money', 'buy', 'flat', 'etc', 'Furthermore', 'family', 'history', 'mental', 'problem', 'mother', 'sharing', 'bed', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'forty', 'something', 'Needless', 'say', 'case', 'norm', 'yet', 'not', 'unconvincing', 'having', 'been', 'concert', 'hall', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'strikingly', 'sad', 'true.What', 'controversial', 'though', 'deliberate', 'distortion', 'sound', 'music', 'be', 'piano', 'vocal', 'music', 'MUSIC', 'LEFT', 'AT', 'ALL', 'ONLY', 'NOISES', 'Perhaps', 'main', 'theme', 'story', 'better', 'delivering', 'greater', 'impact', 'audience', 'yet', 'other', 'hand', 'one', 'also', 'really', 'necessary', 'mix', 'bitteress', 'sweetness', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'impressing']",La Pianiste

And I agree with the other reviewers, that the film's unknownness is directly related to its unconventional tension, which literally made me scratch my seat in the theater.The film focuses on Isabelle Huppert's sexual and social psychosis, and her isolation from the rest of the society. During the course of the movie, Huppert goes through a couple of sexual explosions, which are not at a pleasing nor satisfying level at all, but rather resulting in discontent and hatred among her and her partner, who is the student she gives piano lessons to. This after-scene suffices for you to feel odd. Her sexual inmaturity, gives rise to her weird behavior during daily life. Her seclusion of her own mother, that precedes her real harrassment of her, is a good example of this idea.This film involves severe tension, sexual and social violence.

This is the kind of movie that has to be viewed in its entirety, from beginning to end without interruption. I am not especially fund of dark stories, of sadomasochism. You may want to hold on to something that would make you feel secure and safe while viewing this movie. In a world of dysfunction, the main character, Isabelle Huppert, who plays Erika Kohut is among the top. She is a forty year-old piano professor at the Vienna Conservatory (incidentally she thinks that none of her pupils are good enough). She lives with her mother who worries about her daughter but in actuality is unable to face the fact that her daughter is an adult. Their co-dependency would make you sad. They sleep on the same bed and they even have fistfights! This dysfunctional relationship makes Erika among other things a voyeur. Erika meets a young man, whom she uses to act on her secret desires. He is sympathetically played by Benoit Magimel. Somewhere along the movie you wish she would listen to this man, but this is not a love story although a lot of `I love you' statements are uttered. Even the boyfriend thinks she is sick. It was petrifying to watch a scene where Erika performs an act of self-mutilation. The film never shows the details but the effect is tremendous. This movie drives you on the edge of your seat. It was a relief  when it ended, although quite abruptly, so there goes another French movie that will make you think for a long time after the last frame.If you are already a fan of Isabelle Huppert, you will find this extraordinary and remarkable performance indeed worthy of a Best Actress award (2001 Cannes Film Festival). But if you cringe at the thought of a man hitting a woman but would like to get to know Isabelle Huppert, do not make this be your first movie.

667687,A2OOXUXSS03V3X,B00005NFL5,David M. Goldberg,"[7, 11]","Shortly before seeing this film, I watched a DVD of Bertolucci's "" The Dreamers"", both for the first time. It was informative to compare the two products of film-makers who are regarded as serious practitioners of the Art, and whose work often incorporates explicitly sexual material that risks demeaning their serious intent and exposes them to the charge of gratuitous audience titillation. In the case of Bertolucci's movie, the sex was graphic and not in the best of taste, but one could argue that it had a place in the lives of its young protagonists who were representative of much of their generation: narcissistically focused upon their own self-gratification and freedom of expression at a time when freedom of expression as a whole was under restraint by the State. Not until their indulgence brought their cocooned existence crashing down did they see fit to join those at the barricades fighting for universal freedom.With ""The Piano Teacher"", it is an altogether different matter. We are exposed to two hours of sordid behaviour, self-destructive as well as destructive of others, by a totally deranged individual (Erika) with no redeeming feature beyond a certain musical talent, and no causal factor other than a domineering mother and a father who is mentioned only briefly, but who apparently went mad and killed himself. Even if we accept these as partially exonerating, it still leaves the whole experience as no more than a case-history of lunacy with no universal relevance and no political, moral, religious, ethical or philosophical purpose. The interview with Isabelle Huppert, who plays Erika, included with this DVD reveals the lack of anything meaningful that all concerned in its production have to communicate to its audience. She describes the objective of the director and the motivation of the central character that she plays as an attempt to explore the search for "" true love without the taint of seduction"". What garbage! On this premise, genital mutilation, maternal incest, fornication on the floor of a public toilet, and submission to requested flagellation and physical brutality, all become justified as acts of ""true love"". It is clear that Huppert has no valid idea of why she is doing the awful things she is required by the director to perform; viewed in this light, her much-lauded performance becomes no more than a meaningless charadeinvolving a limited repertoire of scowling gestures and hysterical outbreaksthat soon become boring and irritating to watch.It does not help that the other characters are equally unattractive, at least in their behaviour. As the object of  Erika's perversions, Benoit Magimel initially presents as a sensitive and charismatic young man, but his descent into frenetic violence instead of simply walking away from an impossibly unsavoury relationship ruptures that bond of empathy with the viewer. The technical skills of Michael Haneke  are evident in the composition of many of the frames and sequences that give this film an artistic texture, coupled with the gorgeous music of Schubert, Bach and others that introduce brief interludes of sanitizing poetry. His serious talent, demonstrated in ""Cache"" and ""The White Ribbon"" persuaded me to discount the 16 1-star reviewers and heed the recommendations of the 54 who awarded the movie 5 stars, especially as many of the latter came from intelligent and critically eloquent film buffs. I was fully conditioned by his above-mentioned movies to become immersed in the lives of thoroughly unlikeable individuals, since these seem to represent the only segment of humanity in which he is interested. I expected the compensation of a challenging and thought-provoking experience in return. All I got was senseless depravity without meaning or justification.",1,Lust in the Lavatory,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,3786,"['Shortly', 'seeing', 'film', 'watched', 'DVD', 'Bertolucci', 'Dreamers', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'informative', 'compare', 'two', 'products', 'film-makers', 'who', 'are', 'regarded', 'serious', 'practitioners', 'Art', 'work', 'often', 'explicitly', 'sexual', 'material', 'demeaning', 'serious', 'intent', 'charge', 'gratuitous', 'audience', 'titillation', 'case', 'Bertolucci', 'movie', 'sex', 'was', 'graphic', 'not', 'best', 'taste', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'had', 'place', 'lives', 'young', 'protagonists', 'who', 'were', 'representative', 'much', 'generation', 'narcissistically', 'focused', 'own', 'self-gratification', 'freedom', 'expression', 'time', 'when', 'freedom', 'expression', 'whole', 'was', 'restraint', 'State', 'Not', 'indulgence', 'brought', 'cocooned', 'existence', 'crashing', 'down', 'did', 'see', 'fit', 'join', 'barricades', 'fighting', 'universal', 'freedom.With', 'Piano', 'Teacher', 'altogether', 'different', 'matter', 'are', 'exposed', 'two', 'hours', 'sordid', 'behaviour', 'self-destructive', 'as', 'well', 'destructive', 'others', 'totally', 'deranged', 'individual', 'Erika', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'certain', 'musical', 'talent', 'causal', 'factor', 'other', 'domineering', 'mother', 'father', 'who', 'mentioned', 'only', 'briefly', 'who', 'apparently', 'went', 'mad', 'killed', 'Even', 'accept', 'partially', 'exonerating', 'still', 'whole', 'experience', 'more', 'case-history', 'lunacy', 'universal', 'relevance', 'political', 'moral', 'religious', 'ethical', 'philosophical', 'purpose', 'interview', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'who', 'Erika', 'included', 'DVD', 'lack', 'anything', 'meaningful', 'concerned', 'production', 'have', 'communicate', 'audience', 'objective', 'director', 'motivation', 'central', 'character', 'attempt', 'explore', 'search', 'true', 'love', 'taint', 'seduction', 'What', 'garbage', 'premise', 'genital', 'mutilation', 'maternal', 'incest', 'fornication', 'floor', 'public', 'toilet', 'submission', 'requested', 'flagellation', 'physical', 'brutality', 'become', 'justified', 'acts', 'true', 'love', 'clear', 'Huppert', 'valid', 'idea', 'why', 'doing', 'awful', 'things', 'required', 'director', 'perform', 'viewed', 'light', 'much-lauded', 'performance', 'more', 'meaningless', 'charadeinvolving', 'limited', 'repertoire', 'scowling', 'gestures', 'hysterical', 'outbreaksthat', 'soon', 'become', 'boring', 'irritating', 'watch.It', 'not', 'help', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'equally', 'unattractive', 'least', 'behaviour', 'object', 'Erika', 'perversions', 'Benoit', 'Magimel', 'initially', 'sensitive', 'charismatic', 'young', 'man', 'descent', 'frenetic', 'violence', 'instead', 'simply', 'walking', 'away', 'impossibly', 'unsavoury', 'relationship', 'bond', 'empathy', 'viewer', 'technical', 'skills', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'are', 'evident', 'composition', 'many', 'frames', 'sequences', 'give', 'film', 'artistic', 'texture', 'coupled', 'gorgeous', 'music', 'Schubert', 'Bach', 'others', 'introduce', 'brief', 'interludes', 'sanitizing', 'poetry', 'serious', 'talent', 'demonstrated', 'Cache', 'White', 'Ribbon', 'persuaded', 'discount', '16', '1-star', 'reviewers', 'heed', 'recommendations', '54', 'who', 'awarded', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'especially', 'many', 'latter', 'came', 'intelligent', 'critically', 'eloquent', 'film', 'buffs', 'was', 'fully', 'conditioned', 'above-mentioned', 'movies', 'become', 'immersed', 'lives', 'thoroughly', 'unlikeable', 'individuals', 'seem', 'represent', 'only', 'segment', 'humanity', 'interested', 'expected', 'compensation', 'challenging', 'thought-provoking', 'experience', 'return', 'got', 'was', 'senseless', 'depravity', 'meaning', 'justification']",La Pianiste

The word ""harrowing"" best describes this descent into hell.If you've never been in a battering relationship, you could never understand why someone would stay around and get beaten up day after day, this film will show you. The battering is mutual and invariably followed by bizarre moments of closeness, apology and even tenderness. In emotionally impoverished and dysfunctional families, this is as good as you get, so you go for it.In this sensitive portrayal, the protagonist professor of piano technique, Erika, breaks though her deeply repressed sexuality and attempts to experience love for the first time with one of her students. Attempting to work out her internal conflicts, the love should be expressed alternately in sadism (she's gratuitously mean to all her students) or in masochism (what she demands of her lover is pain and humiliation). Since the object of her desire, Walter, is not only attracive and talented, but also seems to care deeply for her, the agony of this movie is much deeper.As to the film itself, at times it moves slowly. But you need the break to recover from the intensity of the major scenes. The performances of piano and vocal music are paradoxically delightful to hear, and this movie should win an Oscar for ""best sound"" (every creak of a floor board counts).This is a remarkable movie that should be taken seriously and will reward a mature approach.",5,Descending gracefully into the depths of a private hell,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,1481,"['breakthrough', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'should', 'undertake', 'watching', 'lightly', 'word', 'harrowing', 'best', 'descent', 'hell.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'battering', 'relationship', 'could', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'stay', 'around', 'get', 'beaten', 'up', 'day', 'day', 'film', 'will', 'show', 'battering', 'mutual', 'invariably', 'followed', 'bizarre', 'moments', 'closeness', 'apology', 'even', 'tenderness', 'emotionally', 'impoverished', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'as', 'good', 'get', 'go', 'it.In', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'protagonist', 'professor', 'piano', 'technique', 'Erika', 'deeply', 'repressed', 'sexuality', 'attempts', 'experience', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'students', 'Attempting', 'work', 'out', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'love', 'should', 'be', 'expressed', 'alternately', 'sadism', 'gratuitously', 'mean', 'students', 'masochism', 'what', 'lover', 'pain', 'humiliation', 'object', 'desire', 'Walter', 'not', 'only', 'attracive', 'talented', 'also', 'care', 'deeply', 'agony', 'movie', 'much', 'deeper.As', 'film', 'times', 'slowly', 'need', 'break', 'recover', 'intensity', 'major', 'scenes', 'performances', 'piano', 'vocal', 'music', 'are', 'paradoxically', 'delightful', 'hear', 'movie', 'should', 'win', 'Oscar', 'best', 'sound', 'creak', 'floor', 'board', '.This', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'will', 'reward', 'mature', 'approach']",La Pianiste

In summary, the piano teacher follows her sexual fantasies down a path that leads to her destruction. It is as others have said a disturbing film, but for me this is not a compliment. There is little in the film worth taking away. The teacher herself is not especially interesting. She is abusive, mean-spirited, aggressive and destructive as a teacher. She maims one of her charges because the young girl dares to smile at the teacher's new sex toy, a young stud who has convinced himself, unconvincingly, that he loves his tyrant teacher. She is not just perverse; she is criminally insane. Her mother, who is every bit as sick and twisted, is a sexual voyeur and tormentor who exploits her daughter's bizarre sexual predilections which include porn shop cruising, drive-in movie peeping, and self-mutilation. Once she gets her hands on her new charge, she presents him in writing with a list of perverse demands. The handsome boy realizes that he is dealing with a sicko and runs for the hills. She stabs herself. I got little out of watching this mess. Who's to know what it all means or what the author intended. I came up with the idea that this ""World"" is meant to be ""Vienna,"" Europe's literal or symbolic music capital, a city of beautiful music and the birthplace of Hitler and the author, even though Paris has been used as the film's setting by the director.

667691,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005NFL5,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 6]","If it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites, then the cinematic portrait of Erika Kohut has its reality.  Professor Kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself.  Her outward expression projects her desire.  That is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse.Along comes talented, charming, handsome young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity.  He wants to become her student so as to be close to her.  She rejects him out of hand, but because of his talent the Vienna conservatory votes him in.  He falls in love with her.  Again she pushes him away, but he will not take no for an answer, and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect.The question the viewer might ask at this point is, who is in control?  The sadist or the masochist?  Indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist?  It is hard to tell.  Is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment, or is it the person who is rushing out the door, sated, giving the order that no one is to know what happened.But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak.  She is a sex extreme freak.  She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability.  Actually that isn't even true.  She says she doesn't care what others think.  She doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love.  Love, she calls it.  For her sex and love are one and the same.At one point Walter tells her that love isn't everything.  How ironic such a superfluity is to her.  How gratuitous the comment.The movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified (as in the bathroom when Walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find Erika within).  He also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another.  This is particularly important in the scene in which Erika, like a blood-drained corpse caught in stark white and black light, lies under her lover, rigid as stone.  Here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery.  We don't need to see any more.The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert who is not afraid of extremes; indeed she excels in them.  I have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul.  Like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense.  What matters to her is the performance and the challenge.  No part is too demanding.  No character too depraved.  It's as if Huppert wants to experience all of humanity, and wants us to watch her as she does.  She is always fascinating and nearly flawless.  She is not merely a leading light of the French cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work.I think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in The Lacemaker (La Dentelli&egrave;re) from 1977 when she was 22 years old.  There she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing Pomme, a Parisian apprentice hairdresser.  Her character was shy about sex and modest--just an ordinary French girl who hoped one day to be a beautician.  Here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and entirely depraved.Huppert is fortunate in being an actress in France where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets.  (Hollywood could never make a movie like this.)  In the American cinema, only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty.  Huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles, here and also in La C&eacute;r&eacute;monie (1995) in which she plays a vile, spiteful murderess.Do see this for Isabelle Huppert.

667693,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00005NFL5,Doug Anderson,"[4, 5]","Isabelle Huppert is in one great movie after another. A couple of years ago she played the mysterious and apparently selfless wife of a famus composer in Claude Chabrol's Merci Pour Le Chocolat. This time she plays a piano teacher in yet another role filled with subtlety and mystery. The role is in many ways reminiscent of the earlier one as Huppert reveals clues to her characters troubled psyche with odd and disturbing actions which offer a sharp contrast to her calm and collected exterior. She does much of her acting with the same expression which makes her one of the most interesting performers to watch for what she conceals with each performance is what fascinates and keeps us attentive. The performance Huppert gives as the piano teacher is a disturbing one for beneath her reserved exterior and her very high reputation seethe the passions of an unhappy woman. Whether her mother has caused her daughter to grow into the person she has become or not is perhaps a matter for debate. It appears the mother is over protective but then as the story progresses one sees the mother has good reason to be over protective. Huppert's piano teacher loves her mother it seems but also wants to torture her mother. For her students the piano teacher wastes no time with feelings it seems but again the performance is subtle and layered and offers clues that perhaps she does care for them in her way. It is possible to interpret some of her actions in more than one way.

She was unused to men's bodies inexperienced and to be honest it takes practise to swallow an oyster on yer back when even trying to swallow a sip of water on your back would make anyone gag! ! All through the film I never lost empathy with her although tempting to ridiculeUp until he recognises what all the ice thrown on him really signified her suppression and perversion were carefully contained and the terror of opening up such a Pandora's box to her and their eyes was understandably something she fought tooth and nail to have control over. There is always something ingenuous about Walter because he is just too young and virile and compassionate to be complicated by the mess inside her head. If such a thing is possible in real life his direct approach helps her to finally mirror that which is dis-associated in her as sick and mad. He sadistically rejects her after her masochistic letter. Well fair enough because when she begs the error of her ways he does forgive and accept.But then throwing up an oyster is just BAD TIMING in terms of trying to come across as apologetic. That is the comedy before the film takes a dark turn when Walter returns and insanely beats and rapes her. At the concert there is a niave spring in his step as though partially delivering on the request in her letter will hopefully create another rebound from her in terms of coming to her senses again. But of course she already had. The knife meant to atone for the damage he inflicted she turns on herself in disgust but much more so-in self disgust.The film transitions from the world of polished classical recital to tragic opera and underlines the warning that men should never physically harm women because they don't know their own strength.

The present American Foreign Minister in her Denver-childhood was pushed by her parents exactly the same way into the role of a classical Pianist, as Elfriede Jelinek in Vienna had to experience this sort of oppression at her own body. In her novel ""The Piano Player"" the winner of the Nobel-prize (Literature) brings up for discussion in a satirical, sarcastic, cynical, yes shameless way, which sort of soul-destructive dominance mothers in their four domestic walls can unfold, if they are out-pushed from the public job-career-life (still generally the superiority is the male preference). The mother of Elfiede Jelinek after 1945 led negotiations on reparation payments at Austria with Russia - until male persons (leaving the prisoner-of-war-camps, returned, recovered) pushed away female persons from political functions and other jobs. Jelinek converts those experiences in her novel, filled up with certain autobiographic patterns, and there are parallels to the American Condoleezza Rice (by the way ""Condi"" learned Russian to be able to participate effectively at disarmament negotiations between the USA and the Soviet Union ). A stylish seeker of word-using Elfriede Jelinek chose the form of the ice-cold satire, maybe the best way, to reach the necessary distance against things, which have hurt a person very deeply. Franz Kafka by the way wrote probably less based in depression and despair than acting out of a control room of a tremendously biting Jewish humor: The ability to understand this sort of language-use was lost nearly completely after the extinction of the Jewish culture under the Nazi rule in the German-speaking countries . Jelinek therefore assumes, she is understood really correctly neither by the enthusiastic praising price lenders nor by rageful-hateful raving province journalists. Perhaps by Condoleezza Rice, if she had enough time to analyse such novels - and movie-scripts. Madeleine Albright, the Prague fled Rice- and Colin Powell-predecessor in the minister-office of foreign affairs, she is friendly with Condoleezza Rice; the two women noticed the structural comparability of their trauma: Albright, threatened with death by the Nazis and later on bored by the communists, Rice, colored, threatened by the race hatred in the Ku-klux-klan-environment of the 1960-years in the US Southern States. Elfriede Jelinek felt threatened by her prevail-addicted mother. The education-atmosphere at home had been formed by the typical middle-class-aim, to climb up the social ledder, in order to ""make things better"". Mother Jelinek (and the Rice-parents) focused the education-energy on the only child (a procession not divided, because there are existing no brothers and sisters). Condoleezza Rice became not a pianist (the at-first-wish of her parents and herself) but a Foreign Minister with energy-loaded rage on woman-despising Islamic states, unmarried and equally irreconcilably bitingly as the Austrian writer. Jelinek already for a long time didn't practice on her costly Steinway piano, but she became a language-composing Nobel-prize-winner - vulnerable, fighting against a disputable group of austrian politicians, but retired, fearfully withdrawn living, nevertheless relatively consolidated by a husband and by her special sort of biting humor. Condoleezza Rice, sometimes nicknamed as the US-American ""war princess"" or ""Terminatrix"", maybe the world shoud hope, that a little bit more of austrian humor and ability to see things ironically will find a way into Condi's strategy.

Time went on but I could not get the movie and its main character, Erika Kahut out of my mind. The story of a respected Piano teacher in Vienna Conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, an expert in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing. I read the book ""The Piano Teacher"" by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial Nobel Prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it I saw the film again. Second time, all pieces of puzzle came to the right places. Not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as ""Le Pianiste"". Three actors gave outstanding performances. Franz Schubert's Piano music, ""soaked in the morbid humanity"", is another bright star of the movie.I only have one problem with Haneke's vision.  There is a scene in the film where Haneke made some changes to Erika's character comparing to the novel.  In the book, the furthest she went to reveal herself to Walter, the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her was in a letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that, she had stopped communicating with him. Erika of the book would never chase Walter to throw herself to him. She kept everything inside - she did not like to act, she was not a chaser - she loved to watch.

And wouldn't Siggy have been delighted with this film! It's his whole corpus of psychoanalytic observation captured visually. Viewer beware! If you are inclined to regard Freudian psychology with skepticism, you'll detest this film. But it's not a balmy evening's entertainment by any measure. Erika --the 'piano teacher' acted with agonizing credibility by Isabelle Huppert -- is a loathsome harpy [ 'harpy' is an ancient Greek synonym for the B word ] and not the sort of victim of mental illness for whom you'll feel sympathy or pity. In fact, the only character in this film that drew any sympathy from me was the young woman piano student whom Erika victimized.That student's mother is a pushy whiner, a perfect specimen of the new category of ""Tiger Mom."" Conservatory moms, let me tell you, are more than a match for soccer moms or hockey moms in tigerishness. But Erika's mom, acted by Annie Girardot, is the veritable Medusa or Mozart's Queen of the Night. I know nothing at all about the biography of director Michael Haneke except that his mother was an Austrian actress, but I can't help imagining that he has ""issues"" with parenting. This is the second film of his that I've seen in one week. I chose his 2009 film 'The White Ribbon' at my local video rental shop, chiefly because of the photo on the box. That film impressed me enough that I went back to rent 'The Piano Teacher,' a film released in 2001. In the newer film, it's Fatherhood that takes the rap for sociopathy, while in this older film, Motherhood catches some of the blame for psychosis. See what I mean? I can't wait to see what hatefulness Haneke attributes to the influence of uncles!Music is the lubricant for perverse attractions in this film. The handsome, sensitive, accomplished young man -- Walter, acted by Benoit Magimel -- mistakes Erika's ardor for music for sensual passion; there could be no other explanation for his fixation on her, since she hardly exudes physicality. I wasn't entirely convinced by Walter's initial attraction to Erika. I had to 'willingly suspend disbelief' until the double helix of moral degeneration between the two started spiraling downwards. Music is used brilliantly in this film, edited so that the strains of Schubert persist across the temporal boundaries of scenes. Brilliant editing of both sound and picture is possibly the strongest asset of The Piano Teacher.As I said above, this isn't a film you'll properly enjoy. It's brutally savage and too distorted to be tragic. In fact, if you empathize with this film, you might consider consulting a competent Freudian analyst; I can recommend one if you live in Stockholm. The merits of the film are chiefly 'artistic' and cinematographic: powerful dialogue and direction, excellent camera work and editing, stellar performances by Huppert, Girardot, and Magimel.",4,"""Tiger Mom"" in Freud-ville!",1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,3062,"['Where', 'else', 'could', 'set', 'story', 'sexually-repressed', 'masochistic', 'woman', 'Vienna', 'where', 'hysteria', 'was', 'sufficiently', 'common', 'provide', 'living', 'wage', 'cadre', ""'alienists"", 'included', 'one', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'would', ""n't"", 'Siggy', 'have', 'been', 'delighted', 'film', 'whole', 'corpus', 'psychoanalytic', 'observation', 'captured', 'visually', 'Viewer', 'beware', 'are', 'inclined', 'regard', 'Freudian', 'psychology', 'skepticism', ""'ll"", 'detest', 'film', 'not', 'balmy', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'measure', 'Erika', ""'piano"", 'teacher', 'acted', 'agonizing', 'credibility', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'loathsome', 'harpy', '[', ""'harpy"", 'ancient', 'Greek', 'synonym', 'B', 'word', ']', 'not', 'sort', 'victim', 'mental', 'illness', 'whom', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'sympathy', 'pity', 'fact', 'only', 'character', 'film', 'drew', 'sympathy', 'was', 'young', 'woman', 'piano', 'student', 'whom', 'Erika', 'victimized.That', 'student', 'mother', 'pushy', 'whiner', 'perfect', 'specimen', 'new', 'category', 'Tiger', 'Mom', 'Conservatory', 'moms', 'let', 'tell', 'are', 'more', 'match', 'soccer', 'moms', 'hockey', 'moms', 'tigerishness', 'Erika', 'mom', 'acted', 'Annie', 'Girardot', 'veritable', 'Medusa', 'Mozart', 'Queen', 'Night', 'know', 'nothing', 'biography', 'director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'mother', 'was', 'Austrian', 'actress', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'imagining', 'issues', 'parenting', 'second', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'week', 'chose', '2009', 'film', ""'The"", 'White', 'Ribbon', 'local', 'video', 'rental', 'shop', 'chiefly', 'photo', 'box', 'film', 'impressed', 'went', 'back', 'rent', ""'The"", 'Piano', 'Teacher', 'film', 'released', '2001', 'newer', 'film', 'Fatherhood', 'rap', 'sociopathy', 'older', 'film', 'Motherhood', 'blame', 'psychosis', 'See', 'what', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'hatefulness', 'Haneke', 'influence', 'uncles', 'Music', 'lubricant', 'perverse', 'attractions', 'film', 'handsome', 'sensitive', 'accomplished', 'young', 'man', 'Walter', 'acted', 'Benoit', 'Magimel', 'Erika', 'ardor', 'music', 'sensual', 'passion', 'could', 'be', 'other', 'explanation', 'fixation', 'hardly', 'physicality', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'convinced', 'Walter', 'initial', 'attraction', 'Erika', 'had', ""'willingly"", 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'double', 'helix', 'moral', 'degeneration', 'two', 'started', 'spiraling', 'downwards', 'Music', 'used', 'brilliantly', 'film', 'edited', 'so', 'strains', 'Schubert', 'persist', 'temporal', 'boundaries', 'scenes', 'Brilliant', 'editing', 'sound', 'picture', 'possibly', 'strongest', 'asset', 'Piano', 'Teacher.As', 'said', 'above', ""n't"", 'film', ""'ll"", 'properly', 'enjoy', 'brutally', 'savage', 'too', 'distorted', 'be', 'tragic', 'fact', 'empathize', 'film', 'might', 'consider', 'consulting', 'competent', 'Freudian', 'analyst', 'can', 'recommend', 'one', 'live', 'Stockholm', 'merits', 'film', 'are', 'chiefly', ""'artistic"", 'cinematographic', 'powerful', 'dialogue', 'direction', 'excellent', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Huppert', 'Girardot', 'Magimel']",La Pianiste

667707,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005NFL5,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","LA PIANISTE (THE PIANO TEACHER) goes places most film makers dare not tread - the dark aspects of frustrated sexuality where desire and affection cannot meet. In brief, this is the story of the inner world of an exceptional pianist and piano teacher who lives with her mother in a 'marriage arrangement' that appears to satisfy both with its accompanying fights, jealousies, cheatings, and clingings. This cold pianist (incomparably portrayed by the fine Isabelle Huppert) is absorbed by Schubert and Schumann and shares many of those composers' tendencies towards madness and melancholy. Her private acting out of her sexual life includes forays into pornography video booths, drive-in movies for voyeurism, and other sadomasochistic practices that leave her frustrated in her drive to be humiliated and beaten. Into this sad woman's life enters a sensuously handsome student (again, played with complete credibility and finesse by Benoit Magimel) and much of the film is a hard driving match between lust/desire and need/repulsion, the true approach/avoidance conflict.The pace of the film is so correct for a story about the extended periods of ennui between moments of exhilaration that mirror the life inside a music academy. We are treated to some wonderful Schubert, Schumann, Schonberg, and Bach that serves as the 'dialogue' during extended scenes where the piano teacher listens with her eyes and ears and distorted mind, reacting to the music in equal parts with the performing students. Yes, this is a disturbing film, but it is not a grotesque film. Director Michael Haneke manages to place this surreal sexual tragedy for us to understand just how wide the bell curve of human sexuality stretches. An astonishingly fine film - if you are open to explore the dark interstices of the human mind without prejudice. An added feature of an interview on the DVD with Isabelle Huppert about the character she portrays is exceptionally apropos and well filmed.

The cotidianity establishes in her life an unbearable repetition of a long catalogue of common places. Indeed, the obvious conclusion you perceive after she punishes that promising and talented pupil through the most miserable envy feeling and impotence. In her soul depths she knows her pupil will overpass her in a future not so distant.But suddenly the passion appears and with it the Pandora Box will open with her cumulative sum of expected affection, sexual repressions and the wished love that came behind the masque of the oblivion.She will play hard this role of victim and victimary. In her role of teacher the last profile is well known but she knows the time is brief and somehow as the famous Proust novel she intends to search desperately the missed time.To be honest the camera is not to the same level than the performers. Huppert is overwhelming but the camera eye doesn't maintain the same level of required fierceness and mistakenly you can feel it. If you intend to change visual agression with the deepest insights of that troubled soul avid of love and consideration, we have big problem.Think in Nagisa Oshima with the Empire Senses and you will realize that important device.

Her pain is apparent even though she is at many times a fairly odious (and occasionally downright psychopathic character) Hints of what has led her to this situation are given, the unhealthy co-dependant relationship she has with her mother, the perfectionism and driven nature that pervades her working life, madness in the family. In the end it doesn't really matter how it came about as it is an examination of a person in that state and how they fall apart both emotionally and mentally that is being examined here. There are many scenes which stayed in my mind long after the film ended: 2 particular scenes stood out for me:The scene both embarrassing, horrific and also incredibly sad as the young student reads with disgust a letter Huppert has written to him in front of her detailing her sadomasochistic fantasies that she harbors. We are torn between horrors at the graphic nature of the degradation she fetishists and feel sorry for the horrible and humiliating rejection she receives at the hands of the young student.Also the gut wrenching final scene, the act of self mutilation and look of madness and despair on her face, the director has captured the despair and horror of so much of human existence.An important film to see but don't expect to be uplifted!",4,Loneliness & Sexual Perversity make for disturbing bedfellows,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,1852,"['First', 'let', 'put', 'record', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'dynamite', 'performance', 'disturbing', 'ultimately', 'very', 'sad', '.I', 'had', 'first', 'seen', 'movie', 'Ma', 'Mare', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'Piano', 'Teacher', 'hard', 'film', 'watch', 'subject', 'matter', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'not', 'Caf', 'eacute', 'Latte', 'S', 'M', 'pretty', 'young', 'twenty-somethings', 'exploring', 'boundaries', 'here', 'true', 'nature', 'sexual', 'perversity.Loneliness', 'terrible', 'burden', 'bear', 'part', 'strength', 'film', 'director', 'never', 'Huppert', 'freak', 'show', 'pain', 'apparent', 'even', 'many', 'times', 'fairly', 'odious', 'occasionally', 'downright', 'psychopathic', 'character', 'Hints', 'what', 'led', 'situation', 'are', 'given', 'unhealthy', 'co-dependant', 'relationship', 'mother', 'perfectionism', 'driven', 'nature', 'working', 'life', 'madness', 'family', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'examination', 'person', 'state', 'how', 'fall', 'apart', 'emotionally', 'mentally', 'being', 'examined', 'here', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'stayed', 'mind', 'long', 'film', 'ended', '2', 'particular', 'scenes', 'stood', 'out', 'scene', 'embarrassing', 'horrific', 'also', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'young', 'student', 'disgust', 'letter', 'Huppert', 'written', 'front', 'detailing', 'sadomasochistic', 'fantasies', 'harbors', 'are', 'torn', 'horrors', 'graphic', 'nature', 'degradation', 'feel', 'sorry', 'horrible', 'humiliating', 'rejection', 'hands', 'young', 'student.Also', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'final', 'scene', 'act', 'self', 'mutilation', 'look', 'madness', 'despair', 'face', 'director', 'captured', 'despair', 'horror', 'so', 'much', 'human', 'existence.An', 'important', 'film', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'uplifted']",La Pianiste

I was so transfixed when I first saw it in the theater that I went back three more times. This is unlike you will see from an American studio. The French, it seems, display more bravado when dealing with controversial topics. The story centers around Erika (played magnificently by Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher still being treated like a 12-year-old by her mother(Annie Girardot). Erika seems to derive all of her satisfaction in life by means of a piano. When a younger man shows interest in her, she at first, rebuffs him. You get the impression that Erika has never been involved in a relationship with a man before. The problem is, the man,Walter,(also magnificently played by Benoit Magimel), doesn't know what he's getting himself into. The object of his desire performs masochistic experiments on herself, even to the point of drawing blood. (This scene is omitted in the R Rated version.) After Erika has her student attacked she and Walter proceed to have perhaps, the most unusual sex scene you are ever to see on film. The story unravels with her revelation that she wants him to beat her. The catch, ironically enough,is that she doesn't want to be beaten, she wants to be loved. Everything comes to a head at the when Walter beats and rapes her. The apparent moral of this is: don't say anything you don't absolutely mean. And perhaps, be careful what you wish for. Walter, himself, also says something he ultimately doesn't mean. I found the ending unexpected when I first saw it, and I don't want to give it away. You will have to see it for yourself. Isabelle Huppert's performance in this picture is haunting. You sense her character's cold exterior, while simultaneously, sensing her inner vulnerability. The classical music of Franz Schubert is expertly placed in this movie. And it's effect is obvious when you see it. Both co-stars spent a year perfecting the music. There is nothing false about their performances. There are a number of scenes in this movie that can turn your stomach. If you are looking for lighthearted fare you might want to look elsewhere. But if you are intrigued by something complex and daring, a movie that holds no punches, a movie that will have you talking about it after it is over, or if you appreciate first-rate acting, then I highly recommend this movie. It ranks at the very top of my list of favorites, and has made me into a lifelong devotee of Isabelle Huppert.

Menta, Jr.","[3, 5]","A cold, emotionally-repressed piano teacher under the thumb of a domineering mother finds release in a variety of inappropriate, unhealthy ways, including peeping into the car window of a young couple being intimate at a drive-in movie and smelling dirty tissues from the trash can of a porn shop video booth.  Apologies for being so graphic, but potential viewers should be alerted about what they're getting here.  Eventually, the teacher's actions escalate from the inappropriate and mildly criminal activities described to psychotic episodes including the maiming of one of her students.To be fair, the movie is well acted, somewhat interesting, and never becomes boring (the worst sin of a creative work, in my opinion), but in the end the unpleasantness, grossness and endless depressing scenes outweigh the artistic value of the piece, making the film an ordeal to finish.  Obviously, other reviewers here on Amazon feel differently, but this is my take.  And, if you check out my other reviews, you'll see that I don't need a film to be light and feel-good to enjoy it.There's a twenty-minute interview with actress Isabelle Huppert on the DVD, where she says that the crux of the film is the main character's desire to be loved in an old-fashioned way (""like something out of a nineteenth century novel"") in a world where men only want to seduce her.

I don't teach in a conservatory, but do know that artists at that level can become very eccentric, and when they feel threatened, they can be vicious. Still, this film took that to the extreme and then some. Erika's relationship with her mother didn't make it any easier to achieve mental health, and her sexual fantansies and perversions drove her deeper into the abyss. By all outward appearances, she was a repressed, uptight bully with most of her students who went home to a quiet life with her equally repressed, bullying mother, but she often sneaked out at night to act out her fantasies. It's when an attractive student takes a romantic interest in her that she decides she can use him to act out her ultimate fantasies of being beaten and abused to an extreme. She controls him cruelly until he agrees to follow through. Some of this is hard to watch, but the film is never judemental, and Erika's humanity is always there. As twisted as she has become, she is never a caricature or a two-dimensional character.

Her self mutilation scenes made me cringe. Her mannerisms were so rigid and sharp.  I came to wonder how she was able to play music with such finesse. Benot Magimel as Walter Klemmer was excellent. He was just the total opposite of Erika. I'm not quite sure if it is realistic to have that kind of young man be attracted to such a repressive woman. From the start I could not help but feel that the relationship would fail, as it did. Most will be fooled by the cover of the DVD box. The film is not sensual at all. It is incredibly awkward due to Erika's inability to express love and affection. This realization of Erika's unhealthy psychological problems does not doom upon her until Erika goes into a fit of rage. Erika hits her elderly mother as well as attempts to make out with her. Erika is so confused in how to express her feelings. She had been anti-social for a long time. I wasn't surprised about her revealed fetishes. I always thought strict instructors had hidden eccentric oddities about themselves. Poor Walter couldn't hack it. Erika is impious anyway. I cannot believe what Erika did to her poor student.

She's in her forties, wears no makeup, keeps her hair in a bun and dresses in the plainest of clothes.  As a teacher, she is severe and demanding.  She and her mother live together and their constant arguments include slaps and tears and reconciliation.  Her secret life, however, includes pornography, voyeurism and genital self-mutilation. When an attractive young man starts to pursue her romantically, she shocks him with her perversions. How this all plays out is fascinating and the eventual conclusion is inevitable, but along the way the audience is plunged into this very unsettling world.Isabelle Huppert's performance as the teacher is absolutely magnificent.  There are a lot of close-ups of her unsmiling freckled face and dark opaque emotionless eyes.  There is a vague reference to her father being in an insane asylum; other than that there is no back-story to help us understand her.  Benoit Magimel, cast as her young suitor, has a difficult role as well.  During the course of the film, we watch him change before our eyes.  All the other characters are also well cast and give outstanding performances.The director, Michael Haneke, kept the tension and erotic undercurrent strong throughout. There is a lot of classical music and scenes of recitals and piano lessons in a very rigid and upscale world. And then there are those scenes targeted to make the audience squirm in their seats.

She's held in very high esteem at the conservatory where she teaches. She holds private lessons and does recitals. She's prim, proper and brutally strict with her students. She also cruises porno shops, watches the porn videos (graphically displayed and the only skin in this film) and peeps in lovers' parked cars at the drive-in where she gets so turned on she urinates. She also cuts her vagina with a razor when frustrated. She lives with her aged harridan mother (Annie Girardot) who pushes her daughter to achieve so hard that it results in mama bashing. Then along comes stud-puppy/jock/wanna-be piano whiz Walter (Benoit Magimel) who starts hitting on Erika right and left until she caves in (in a bathroom) and reveals her inability to have normal sex which frustrates the heck out of Walter. But he professes to love her and agrees to whatever she wants. Sort of. She writes a letter telling him what she wants. The utter degradation she desires in that letter made me wonder, dear Lord---how many ""dark sides"" does this woman have? She wants to be tied up, slapped around, beaten, sexually humiliated, gagged---the list goes on and on. Walter is repulsed. No dice, Erika. She follows him and begs for his forgiveness and then promptly throws up when he complies to her demands for impromptu oral sex. He throws her out in disgust. Then he comes begging back in the middle of the night, claiming she's bewitched his brain with her ""sickness"". He locks Mama in the bedroom, brutally beats and kicks Erika and rapes her. He says in effect, ""Isn't this what you wanted?"" What a cad. He even gets away with it. But the ending is what really threw me. I felt like I was the one needing a good slap. The performances in this film are excellent. Especially Huppert. But I can't believe she let the director get away with that ending. It just left me empty and mad that I watched it. The character of Walter is disgusting. Erika is no less pathetic---she's extremely sick and even puts broken glass in a promising but scared student's coat pocket so she'll slice up her hand and can't play. And gets away with it!

It is quite unlike any other motion picture experience I have ever had.Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress and she absolutely shines in her role as a psychotic piano teacher who can't get what she wants, so goes out to ruin the life of others. The movie reveals this slowly and beautifully. I was impressed that there was no attempt at pop psychology or mediocre explanations that you would expect in a Hollywood melodrama with similar subject matter. The film is done in a simple, elegant, and gut-wrentching style, sure to fascinate and disturb, even if the film is hated in the end. Also worth mentioning is that Hubert's troubled but sympathetic character lives with her mother, in what has to be one of the most chilling mother/child relationships since PSYCHO.This is an exceptional film, thought-provoking, powerful, and strangely moving. It is not for those who can't face the dark side of human nature. It's far from being a life affirming &quot;feel good&quot; movie; it's a movie that is difficult to watch and raises plenty of questions. If the difficult subject matter of 'Irreversible' interested you, then this is your kind of movie. I enjoyed it immensely, as uncomfortable as I was watching it, and consider it a worthwhile, rewarding experience.The film has a haunting and disturbing finale, and is not always easy to digest, and therefore, it is not for all tastes.

667729,A14SOHUCCL0606,B00005NFL5,Nowhere Man,"[135, 145]","When I first heard about Michael Haneke's ""The Piano Teacher"", about a sexually repressed instructor at the Vienna Conservatory, I thought it was exactly the kind of movie I didn't want to see.  In a world awash in pop music, South Park and Britney videos, how could a film about the stultifyingly uptight classical music world have *any* relevance for a post-modern, post-everything film buff (even if he is American?)  Didn't Bergman tread this ground 40 years ago?  Didn't Bunuel make savage fun of the hypocrisy of bourgeois sexual  respectability in ""Belle de Jour"" (1966)?  Wasn't Haneke a little behind the times?Walking - or I should say staggering - out of the theater 2.5 hours later, I was humbled by the scope of Haneke's and Huppert's achievement.  Rarely have I seen a film both so clear-eyed about sexual psychosis and yet so compassionate as well.  Isabelle Huppert, who probably wasn't nominated for an Oscar only because the film can be so off-putting to some, gives what can only be described as an intense performance.  Her clenched face and the darting movements of her eyes reveal more about her character - her inner rage, her self-hatred - than most actors can achieve with sheets and sheets of dialouge.  That's the essence of the film, everything is very formally *controlled* - so that when violence, self-inflicted or otherwise, breaks out, it is startling because it emerges from such as civilized veneer.If the point of the film were to demonstrate the High Culture spiritually deforms those who engage in it (and I don't think it does), the film would have minimal interest.  High culture has been on the defensive so long, it doesn't need to be blamed for driving Isabelle Huppert nuts as well.  Rather the film gains its strength from watching a seriously damaged human being - damaged in ways only suggested at - construct a protective cocoon around herself that fails to protect her from troublesome feelings and desires.  The film is somewhat similar to Neil Jordan's great film, ""The Butcher Boy"" whose protagonist uses an opposite strategy - relentless good cheer -to mask the absolute misery he's sinking into.  In these two films, as well as other recent films like Noe's ""I Stand Alone"", Nyutten's ""L'Humanite"", Haneke's other recent film ""Code: Unknown"" and Tim Roth's ""The War Room"", European filmmakers are portraying contemporary Europe as a society rife with cultural and psychological malaise - along with a great uncertainty as to ability of others to ameliorate the misery that man hands to his fellow man.""The Piano Teacher"" is important - essential even - not because Isabelle Huppert is asked to do things on camera few major actresses would willingly agree to.  The film gets right to the dark heart of our contemporary malaise - our declining faith in the ability of culture - or anything - to ease us out of our despair and mitigate the cruelty we often see around us.

The director is known as just a person who likes to mess with your brains. Anyone who has seen his previous works will snap this one up in an instant. Those who enjoy this movie will likely try his other fine beverages for the head.Basically the protagonist, a sexually insane music teacher, is as mad as bag of hammers yet manages to stay somewhat somber in her profession because she fits in with the rest of the snobs, but deep inside she is totally and completely bananas with a surreal sized suppressed sexual appetite to boot. So she walks the music halls with his lemon sucking expression among all the other lemon suckers who are sucking their lemons for very different reasons to hers and for this reason nobody really knows who or what she is like.When a music student falls head over heels in love with her they set out on a voyage of absolute debauchery in every nock and cranny that they can do it in. However his love of her is totally blind to her madness. He perceives her sadomasochism as an extension of her frustration when in fact that it just another major part of her psychosis. As they delve around with each other (sometimes very violently) the viewer begins to understand that this is really just a very sick woman who needs treatment fast and yet the world she works in and her lover can not identify it. In fact many viewers will fail to grasp that the main character is crazy until the very last scene which drives the message home like a knife to the heart.This is great art-house cinema and as an insane movie ranks up there with the best of them.

667734,A18V2GU7SQ21YN,B00005NFL5,Renault,"[0, 0]","Nobel or no, it surprised me Jelinek's novel got made into a movie.  There is of course a filmable plot to the book, but its blunt narrative is so stylized, almost childish in its urgent impetus, and hounded all throughout with a foreboding sense of reader-voyeurism, that it seemed to me totally unfilmable or at least very difficult to reproduce on film.And then I thought - of course, Haneke.  The master of cool intellectual voyeurism, done in a visually often flat but (for the viewer) psychologically harrowing way.  Plus, Huppert, the master of sangfroid surrender.  It could not be any more perfect.  Who else but these two to translate onto film the strange, disinterested yet intense tone of the book?!  Yet, curiously, the result is surprisingly a lot less like either Jelinek or Haneke.For one thing, I've never seen his camera as romantic as it is here.  It's almost lyric, and although unblinking in its gaze on Erika, it also clearly pities her.  It shows her depravity, but it *sees* her as ill.  I found myself wondering why Haneke did this.  He could not have failed to see the book has far less pity than a slight contempt in its clinical scrutiny.  Nor could it quite have been the usual 'movie' reason of having to make its main character sympathetic enough to stay with -- at least not for the director of movies like 'The Seventh Continent.'These aren't complaints.  I have no complaints against this movie.  But it should be said that even if Haneke isn't interested in a transparent novel-to-film transfer, it's not as obvious in its being a 'Haneke' film (again, not a complaint).Actually, I think the movie is all Huppert's.

667736,A379FTDQT1NKSN,B00005NFL5,Robert Pratte,"[7, 9]","Many of the reviews have provided very good plot summaries, descriptions of major scenes, etc., but none have really given a good description of how this film makes you, as the viewer, feel.  This is a pity, because here we have a powerful film that leaves you unsettled and puzzled.  The main characters are far enough askew that you cannot identify with them, but real enough that you empathize.  Moreover, while it is easy to say that the sado-masochistic themes are what makes this film troubling, there are really many layers where we are stymied in our hope for resolution and explanation.Clues are strewn throughout the story, bits of history that we latch on to in our quest to understand why this piano teacher is so cruel, why she withstands the abuses of her mother, why she mutilates herself.  The easy answers are unsatisfactory.  She abuses her mother as much as she is abused.  Her father went crazy, but was there something unspeakable in his past?  She is a perfectionist, but seems jealous of others.  Inevitably we attempt to use these clues to ""solve"" the puzzle, but our piano teacher always seems one step ahead in eluding us.  Further, this leave-a-clue/elude-resolution pattern continues through the final scene of the film, thus we cannot attempt to understand or explain it until after we have seen it in its entirety.  Watch this film with someone and you will spend hours discussing it in an attempt to understand it.  Usually, when my wife and I watch a film, we discuss how it fits in with other films, its potential importance and influence(s).  With this film our discussion never made it outside the film - we were trying to understand the characters.This film changes the way you look at other people.  When we are introduced to the main characters,Erika Kohut and her student Walter Klemmer, we see characteristics that remind of of others we know.  Yet as we learn more about them, we are disturbed.  We don't like what we find when we cross from the public to the personal - and by extension we begin to wonder about those around us, even how we appear to others.  That we never resolve the characters, that we never figure out how to categorize and place them, exacerbates this disruption of our view of humanity.  The real and the surreal are so tightly woven in the characters that we lose confidence in our ability to discern.  We become a bit like Walter Klemmer who is clearly flailing in his attempt to regroup after his teacher reveals a bit of her ""real"" self.While the film is disturbing, the shock comes from the characters, particularly Erika.  Her actions defy our sensibility, and while there are serious sexual overtones - if not plain sexual actions - in the film, everything is so much imbued with a sense of pain and emotional sickness that we are shocked rather than titillated.  Visually the film is beautiful, if a bit dark.  Sense of space, mood, and feeling change with ease.  This is a film that looks natural, rich, and vibrant.  The disjuncture between the public scenes and the private interior of the characters (again, primarily Erika, though Walter throws us a few curves) is part of what makes this film work so well.Again, I highly recommend this film, but with the stipulation that it is not for the weak of heart.",5,"Disturbing, surprising, and very powerful.",1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,3284,"['Many', 'reviews', 'have', 'provided', 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'summaries', 'descriptions', 'major', 'scenes', 'etc.', 'none', 'have', 'really', 'given', 'good', 'description', 'how', 'film', 'viewer', 'feel', 'pity', 'here', 'have', 'powerful', 'film', 'unsettled', 'puzzled', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'enough', 'can', 'not', 'identify', 'real', 'enough', 'empathize', 'Moreover', 'easy', 'say', 'sado-masochistic', 'themes', 'are', 'what', 'film', 'troubling', 'are', 'really', 'many', 'layers', 'where', 'are', 'stymied', 'hope', 'resolution', 'explanation.Clues', 'are', 'strewn', 'story', 'bits', 'history', 'latch', 'quest', 'understand', 'why', 'piano', 'teacher', 'so', 'cruel', 'why', 'abuses', 'mother', 'why', 'easy', 'answers', 'are', 'unsatisfactory', 'mother', 'as', 'much', 'abused', 'father', 'went', 'crazy', 'was', 'there', 'something', 'unspeakable', 'past', 'perfectionist', 'jealous', 'others', 'Inevitably', 'attempt', 'use', 'clues', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'piano', 'teacher', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'eluding', 'Further', 'leave-a-clue/elude-resolution', 'pattern', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'thus', 'can', 'not', 'attempt', 'understand', 'explain', 'have', 'seen', 'entirety', 'Watch', 'film', 'someone', 'will', 'spend', 'hours', 'discussing', 'attempt', 'understand', 'Usually', 'when', 'wife', 'watch', 'film', 'discuss', 'how', 'other', 'films', 'potential', 'importance', 'influence', 's', 'film', 'discussion', 'never', 'made', 'film', 'were', 'trying', 'understand', 'characters.This', 'film', 'changes', 'way', 'look', 'other', 'people', 'When', 'are', 'introduced', 'main', 'characters', 'Erika', 'Kohut', 'student', 'Walter', 'Klemmer', 'see', 'characteristics', 'remind', 'others', 'know', 'learn', 'more', 'are', 'disturbed', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'find', 'when', 'cross', 'public', 'personal', 'extension', 'begin', 'wonder', 'even', 'how', 'appear', 'others', 'never', 'resolve', 'characters', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'categorize', 'place', 'disruption', 'view', 'humanity', 'real', 'surreal', 'are', 'so', 'tightly', 'woven', 'characters', 'lose', 'confidence', 'ability', 'discern', 'become', 'bit', 'Walter', 'Klemmer', 'who', 'clearly', 'flailing', 'attempt', 'regroup', 'teacher', 'bit', 'real', 'film', 'disturbing', 'shock', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Erika', 'actions', 'defy', 'sensibility', 'are', 'serious', 'sexual', 'overtones', 'not', 'plain', 'sexual', 'actions', 'film', 'everything', 'so', 'much', 'imbued', 'sense', 'pain', 'emotional', 'sickness', 'are', 'shocked', 'rather', 'titillated', 'Visually', 'film', 'beautiful', 'bit', 'dark', 'Sense', 'space', 'mood', 'feeling', 'change', 'ease', 'film', 'natural', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'disjuncture', 'public', 'scenes', 'private', 'interior', 'characters', 'again', 'primarily', 'Erika', 'Walter', 'few', 'curves', 'part', 'what', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'well.Again', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'stipulation', 'not', 'weak', 'heart']",La Pianiste

667738,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B00005NFL5,Russell Fanelli,"[114, 123]","The Piano Teacher shows us a few days in the life of a disturbed woman who is both victim and victimizer.  Isabelle Huppert briliantly plays the part of Erika Kohut, a middle-aged piano teacher at a music college in Vienna.  Annie Giradot is no less effective as her domineering and watchful mother.  The two women abuse one another physically and verbally.  This relationship is long standing and comes to a crisis as the film progresses.Erika is unable to break the bonds that attach her to her mother.  Instead, like a child who has never grown up, she wants to please her mother, but is driven to act out her own fantasies secretly.  Her mother appears to be unaware of the deep seated repression that is consuming her daughter.  What she does see is an angry, hateful person who lies to her and deceives her frequently.Erika's sexual frustration takes the form of physical and pschological self-hate.  She visits porn shops to degrade herself and she mutilates her body to distract her from the intense psychological pain she suffers constantly.At school her anger takes the form of verbal abuse to her students who are unable to achieve the artistic integrity she demands.  What appears to be an inflated sense of her own importance as an artist masks her frustration at being second-rate.  She is not good enough to be recognized as an artist in her own right.  Her hatred of herself and her inadequacy as an artist prompt her to strike out at students and colleagues alike.Into her seething cauldron of despair comes a young engineering student, Walter Klemmer, wonderfully played by Benoit Maginel, who wants to study Schubert with her.  At first she refuses him, but pressure by the school to accept him forces her to work with him.  The sexual tension between teacher and pupil is immediately apparent and moves forward to a collision some reviewers have likened to a bad car accident.In the end we see Erika and her student reduced to the lowest common demoninator as human beings.  At first Erika is successful at dominating her young student, but the tables are turned as she becomes dependent on him.  Both teacher and student are playing a zero sum game to lose.  The final climax and its denoument leave Erika a wounded, broken woman.The director, Michael Haneke, elicits finely tuned performances by all the players, particularly Huppert, who is magnificent in the title role.  Haneke has made this film for adults only.  It is dark and disturbing from beginning to end with moments of pain and violence that are as real as anything one is likely to see on the screen.Huppert as the piano teacher has no redeeming qualities we are able to see in the short space of time covered by the film.  Viewers looking for a pleasant and agreeable entertainment are urged to search elsewhere.

667740,APDPA11IZPYLN,B00005NFL5,"Sheila Chilcote-Collins ""Sheila Renee Chilcot...","[12, 15]","&quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; is the story of Erika Kohut (a once in a lifetime role, perfectly played by French actress, Isabelle Huppert) is a renowned piano professor at the Vienna Conservatory, a top-notch prestigious music school in Vienna.Erika, in her early forties and still painfully single, lives and even sleeps in the same bed with her vicious, overprotective and sadistic controlling mother (played aptly by Annie Girardot, however the part was initially offered to the fabulous Jeanne Moreau).Erika is a complex human being to say the least. Besides the fact that she is playing host to a many colored different lifestyle by acting as the &quot;man of the house&quot;, Erika is utterly and deeply sexually repressed. When things in Erika's tiny, cloistered life get too horribly awful for her own self-expression and outpouring of feelings, she resorts to sexual self-mutilation, voyeurism, porn shops, and her own underworld of unspeakable acts on other human beings besides herself.Then... Erika meets Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), a engineering student-cum-talented pianist who signs on to Erika's &quot;Master Class&quot; that she teaches at conservatory. Walter is struck by the singularly quiet but strong, Erika and he lets his feelings be known. However, Erika &quot;expresses&quot; herself in very &quot;different&quot; ways such as sexual sado-masochism and writes to Walter all the things that she longs for him to &quot;do&quot; to her, all the while, Erika treats Walter like less than a human as she does, most all the people and her own students in her sick, sad and twisted life.The irony of this story is that Erika can only truly express herself and her scant good, beautiful and natural feelings &quot;a priori&quot;- in and through her music, but in really no other way. Her sick and twisted thoughts of man overpowering woman, rape, a sexual relationship with her own mother, self-mutilation, and general sadistic behavior overtake her and in the end... Well, watch and find out for yourself.Really, over and above it all, Erika's jealousy of other human beings who can and DO express their longings, fears, joys, and disappointments get to her in the end. When Erika is finally able to express her feelings and what it is she THINKS that she wants and desires in her sad half-human, base sort of way, she is rejected and thus the end to the tale is quite a sad one...This is probably the most sexually charged movie that I have viewed without any of the cast being the least bit naked. There is no quivering frontal flesh in this fabulous film, only frightful, frigid, fruitless feelings that will cut you to the bone...Careful Viewing Is Required...",4,"Debasement, Debauchery, Deceitfulness!

Most of you have probably read the synopsis already, so I'll just go on with my review. This film is either one of two things. Either it's a sorry excuse to torture the audience, or it is a richly textured character study of a woman who has some deeply rooted problems. I believe it's a bit of both - and I am no prude. I am always up for a challenging film, but there were times during The Piano Teacher where I just wanted to look away. I came close to cutting it off. However, I have set a strict rule for myself, in that the first time I watch a film, I watch it in it's entirety. I finished it, and I am glad that I did. There would have been no point in stopping it prematurely. The performances were excellent all around. Isabelle Huppert is totally and utterly convincing in what had to have been a difficult, exhausting role. Haneke's direction was amazing as well. The end was very powerful, and haunted me for a week.I still can't stop thinking about this film, however I don't think that I could recommend it, either.

Had I read these reviews, I probably would have not chosen to view this film. However, not knowing what to expect, I found this one very engaging, gripping and more than a bit haunting. Increasingly repulsive, yet fascinating on a number of levels. There is less plot than in the visually-stunning ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" or beautiful muscial ""Sweeney Todd,"" (both highly recommended), but this similarly takes you deeper into the twisted psyche of a monstrous human being -- in this case, a repressed middle-aged, French classical piano teacher. Powerful images stayed with me long after viewing. It's a well-crafted, superbly-acted film on a very difficult, abstract subject. Highly recommended if you like looking into the darker layers of humanity, society and sexuality, without Hollywood's mandatory PC crap or in-your-face politicizing.

It's true that director Michael Haneke is Austrian, but my guess is the best actors in European cinema today are French. Isabelle Huppert is one of the best and she proves it by portraying the complex role of the piano teacher. Watch her commentary that is included with this film, which is in English. She explains that the theme of the movie is that the piano teacher is afraid of being hurt. She wants love but not seduction and thus wants to control the relationship with her student. I would bet that she speaks good German, but wouldn't you rather hear her speak French?This is my fourth Haneke film: three are in French and one is in German. Regardless of the language, they are all complex, intelligent films. I note some of the comments made by reviewers here: ""twisted cinema"", ""a very unsettling world"", ""provocative perversions"", ""beyond weirdness"", ""holy crap"" and much more. Sure, there is some nudity and unusual sexual behavior here.
