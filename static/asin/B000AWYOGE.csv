933851,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B000AWYOGE,Ace-of-Stars,"[7, 13]","*Hello... Hollywood? May I ask a ""special request"" of you?PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!!! *STOP* remaking influential Asian Horror movies! ENOUGH ALREADY! Okay??? Please STOP destroying these pictures and distorting the stories (and the impact) of the original Asian releases!Yes, I know we in America are lazy and don't like reading subtitles. Yes, I know 'conventional wisdom' insists that ''all [insert whichever respective 'ethnic group' here] look alike'' to us and that by giving us some of ''our own'' to look at makes it all the easier for us to 'relate to' and whatnot. Yeah, yeah... all well & good IF that's what you are all thinking over there sitting behind your executive desks and in your decision making 'groupthink' sessions. Fine. BUT PLEASE STOP CHANGING AND DISTORTING VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING ELSE about the original movie material your so-called ""remakes"" are based on!I can overlook-- even forgive --a few not terribly significant reshapings here and there (which is why I hold no grudge [no pun intended] against Sam Raimi's relatively 'faithful' remake of ""JUON,"" titled ""THE GRUDGE""). But just like Gore Verbinski's overly-loud & over-the-top remake of Nakata Hideo's ""RING,"" Walter Salles has changed so much of the original movie presentation of ""HONOGURAI MIZU NO SOKO KARA"" that I was sighing and shaking my head throughout much of the movie. The changes were so many and so disturbing that I would have given real consideration to asking for my money back, had it not been for the fact that I saw it at our local ''second chance'' dollar-theater for the matinee price of fifty cents.As a 'stand alone' movie, for someone who's had no exposure to the original movie (which was also directed by Nakata Hideo), I'm not going to diss it too much; but if you have by chance seen Nakata's version prior to this one and you want to compare notes, be forewarned!I knew this movie was headed for trouble right from the very beginning when it became apparent that the ""Yoshimi"" character (Dahlia) spent no real time looking for housing and that the ""Ikuko"" character (Cecilia) was a real snotty little b*tch NOT because she was tired of walking & looking at places to live with her mother (as was the case in the original movie) but because she was just a snotty little b*tch. From there it was all downhill. The red ""Mimiko"" purse (which, for familiarity purposes, becomes a ""Hello Kitty"" backpack) is no longer central to the plot of the movie; EVERYBODY'S motivation(s) for their actions and behaviors have been thoroughly distorted to the point of non-recognition; the ""Mitsuko"" ghost-girl (Natasha) is no longer shrouded in mystery; and on and on!Typical of Hollywood, the ""subtlety"" of the original has been dispensed with and everything has been spoonfed to us -- much of which was never explicitly expressed in the Japanese film -- and where there WERE insights into the characters and motivations in that first film, these were either reshaped or covered over or done away with altogether. The only somewhat positive thing I can credit this particular remake for is that it managed to retain some of the eerie atmosphere of Nakata's film, an area where the remakes of ""Ring"" and ""Juon"" paid next to no attention.So I suppose it's going to be no great surprise to anyone when another team of Hollywood Hacks get their hands on Thailand's ""SUTTER KODTID WINYAN"" (''SHUTTER'') and totally & completely render it, too, into an unrecognizable pile of mish-mash.Here's a challenge for all of you Hollywood elitists:Rather than taking ""GOOD"" movies and ruining them by 'remaking' them (since it's become quite apparent by your endless hunger to produce remakes that you can no longer generate an original idea of your own anymore), why not dig up some of the many ""BAD"" movies out there (like ""REPTILICUS,"" ""LASERBLAST,"" ""STREET FIGHTER"" and ""FANTASTIC FOUR,"" to name a few) and try making them into something better? That way, you could do a much more convincing job of proving that you have ''creative'' talent instead of the ''destructive'' variety!",2,"STOP IT, ALREADY!

I don't care if they're cheaply made, badly acted, or not well thought out, as long as they do one of two things: either make me jump a couple times, or at least have some good gore.Dahlia Williams is moving into an apartment with her daughter on Roosevelt Island.  Dahlia is going through a divorce (backstory) and is under a lot of stress due to her current situation.  The apartment seems nice at first, until she notices a leak in the bedroom.  From that point, the movie never seems to have any focus.  Are we supposed to be worrying about the leak? the imaginary friend? the obnoxious tenants of the building? Dahlia's divorce?  It's never made clear until the end, when we get the classic revelation of what happened in the apartment upstairs, and why it's affecting Dahlia.Dark Water cannot be considered a horror movie.  The only reason it falls into that category is because the storyline involves a ghost.  There are no scares in this movie.  There are no scary moments.  There is no tension, whatsoever.

Like some of the others, it focuses on mother.....be they good or bad.  This movie offers a lot more depth than many give it credit for.  It could almost be a five star movie except that it does move somewhat slow at some points.  Still, overall it doesn't dissapoint.The story picks up with a young mother who is recently divorced and is battling her ex-husband for custody.  In addition to this, she must find a decent job, a suitable school in which to send her daughter, and a place to live.  It is the latter where the problem in the story arises.Connelly's character is forced to take a run down apartment on Roosevelt Island.  The movie nearly always has a gloomy setting with seemingly endless rain and shades of gray.  The high-rise apartment buildings are so impersonal.  As they move in, a dark water stain on the daughter's ceiling is apparent.  This grows as the movie progresses as does her daughters belief in her imaginary friend from upstairs.Water that is indeed often dark plays a big visual role in the movie.  It is full of powerful symbols and symbolism.  The characters are well developed though some almost go over the edge of being reasonable.  But this adds to the charm of the movie.  The ending could have been better, but overall it was a well written and entertaining ghost story.

Dahlia finds an apartment on Roosevelt Island. The apartment's cramped and the building on the neglected side but the school is excellent. The ex threatens to sue for custody unless she moves to his neighborhood. So Dahlia is trying to find a lawyer, get the plumbing in the upstairs apartment, which is leaking into her bedroom fixed, and deal with Cecilia's sudden development of an imaginary friend, and finding a new job.Dahlia suffers from severe and frequent migraines and her ex is charging that she is mentally unstable and unfit to care for their child. Finally, getting a lawyer she begins to take charge of her life. She tries to find the source of the water leaking from upstairs and learns that the family moved out and the daughter has the same name as Cecilia's imaginary friend. The lawyer takes each issue at face value as Dahlia seems to be degenerating into insanity.The audience can see things going on that the major characters don't see and so you're left wondering what is going to happen next. The film is dark and creepy but far more psychologically creepy than scary for most of the film. Of course, just when you think things may turn out okay there are several twists that pull the rug out from under the viewer.

I don't care about that sort of thing, I'll make my own judgment, but I was aware. And guess what?? How right the critics are this time! Wow! I'll say it simply -- this is not a very good movie. The events unfold well enough to give you seriously creepy feelings, but in the end, I wished I hadn't put in nearly 100 minutes of my time watching something that was truly mediocre.Jennifer Connelly stars as Dahlia, a woman who is dealing with an icky divorce as well as an icky custody battle involving her only child, an adorable little girl named Cecilia. Dahlia and Cecilia move into a new apartment, an inredibly nasty apartment with a terrible leak problem. And this isn't just regular water. It's DARK water. Ooooo!! Spooky! Eventually we learn that the apartment above her own was lived in by a family of three. They, too, had a little girl, right at Cecilia's age. Meanwhile, Cecilia's teacher is concerned because she keeps talking to an imaginary friend named Natasha. You guessed it -- Natasha is also the name of girl who once lived above them. So obviously we have a ghost on our hands.I don't want to reveal to much, just in case you actually want to see this drek and be surprised for yourself. You won't so much be surprised as you will be bewildered. Why does Dahlia do that?? Come on! Why does she give in?? I realize that you have no clue what I'm talking about, but, well, you'll see eventually. Check this out if your looking to be creeped out.

933859,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,B000AWYOGE,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[1, 2]","An unsettling movie that leaves you hanging, wondering whether you're watching someones's delusions, or their submersion into a creepy reality. To me, the pay off doesn't satisfy that desire to know which it  really is. But half the movie's suspense is wondering whether you're being delivered a horror movie, or a hauntingly real movie that will have some plausible explanation. In that, I was disappointed, particularly with the movies ending. I felt that no sooner was I settled into what this movie really was, the director jerked me around- for lack of a better  comparison, like the ending of ""Friday the 13th."" Not to mislead anyone into thinking this is a movie of that genre's extent. But just as you thought in the original ""13th"" that the mother was doing all of the killing, BOOM! Cheatingly, a dream of a disfigured Jason emerging horrifically from the water takes you in a different direction, totally contradicting what the movie led you to believe, and in the process, setting up a slew of sequels based on that redirection. ""Dark Water"" had that effect on me. It seemed as if it didn't know what it wanted to be, or that it was toying with me. Is that good directing or bad directing? Perhaps that was the intention of the director all the way. Creepiness describes many aspects of this movie: the characters, the apartment and the neighborhood in which it sets and the atmosphere it creates, and the unsettlingness that comes with a divorce. To be fair, the direction is good at creating a dark atmosphere that leaves you gasping at the possibilities, including the movie's use of the 2 main actors, the mother and daughter combo of Jennifer Connelly and Ariel Gade, who both do a great job in their roles.A huge Connelly fan, I endured a movie that were it starring anyone else, I may not have sat through. In that I salute the director in his casting. Jennifer is her usual outstanding self, but this movie ranks low in her catalogue of films I've viewed (many which I own). And I was impressed with the work of the young Gade too.

We often hear parents say that they'd die for them, but dying is only going so far. What would you be willing to endure in the afterlife for your child ...and perhaps someone else's kid?In DARK WATER, directed by Walter Salles and starring Jennifer Connelly, we get to see exactly how far a damaged mother will go for her child.Dahlia (Connelly) is going through a bitter divorce and custody battle. For her job's sake, Dahlia is forced to move outside the hub of New York City and into a dark, dank apartment complex on Roosevelt Island. With her comes her daughter, Ceci, a ten-year-old with a perceptive extrasensory ability. Or does she have that ability? As soon as they enter the apartment complex, Ceci begins to feel poorly and asks to leave, but her mother insists that they check out the apartment. They soon move in and stranger things begin happening: dark water drips from the ceiling, Dahlia sees her mother (who'd abandoned her) in strange dreams, Ceci talks to an imaginary friend named Natasha, and the elevator button for their floor (#9) is burned or damaged.As the plot unfolds, we learn that the neighbors directly above Dahlia and Ceci's apartment were Russian immigrants who had a child, but neither the child nor the parents have been seen in some time. Did something foul happen to them? Further research by Dahlia's divorce attorney (played by Tim Roth ) shows that the adults from the upstairs apartment are separated and living apart ...but neither of them have their daughter, who's name happens to be Natasha. Where is she? Is she the same Natasha that Ceci talks to in her imagination? Are Ceci and Natasha somehow connected with the dark water dripping from their ceiling?_________________________________________________________________________________________The tone and dark, wet scenes set the tone for DARK WATER in a very revealing fashion. Water plays a vital part of how the viewer perceives much of what is shown on-screen, giving the entire production a rather somber (if downright depressing) feel. This is prime strength of the movie, getting us into how Jennifer Connelly's character feels and why she reacts the way she does (especially after seeing her as a young girl in the opening scenes, waiting for her negligent mother to come and get her from school ...and again, it's raining).Much has been said about this film regarding how much was intended to be psychological versus supernatural. But for me, it was all supernatural. The only part the psychology of Connelly's character played in the film was, again, helping set the tone and as a method for one ghostly apparition to feed off of. If Ceci (the daughter) can see the ghost, then it's not a psychological breakdown on her mother's part.Comparisons between THE RING and THE GRUDGE are pretty obvious, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film. But it did make me wonder about how many other thriller films out there are using the same format now.

If you take what you're given though, it's a decent movie, if only for Jennifer Connelly fans.I understand that Walter Salles probably wanted to make a different kind of horror/suspense movie, and I appreciate that effort, but he fell terribly short of the goal. First off, the only two suspenseful parts are when Ceci (Gade) refuses to talk to Natasha (Haney-Jardine) during school which ends with a confrontation in the bathroom and then when Natasha is drowning Ceci while Dahlia (Connelly) is trying to help her.From a strickly acting point of view, this movie is chock-full of great performances. Jennifer Connelly, like always, is great, her daughter in the movie, Ariel Gade, puts on quite the believable performance, and John C. Reilly injects a subtle humor into his role as Mr. Murray.As much as I wanted to love this movie, I don't. Basically the plot seems to deal with domestic drama more than the actual 'dark water.' There's several occassions where something intense could've happened or been built upon, but it wasn't, instead we're treated to Connelly's character looking back at how her mother didn't love her.

933866,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,B000AWYOGE,Brian,"[1, 1]","I really must agree with the consensus here as it relates to ""Dark Water,"" the latest American retooling of an Asian release. As much as I honestly wanted to to fully appreciate the positive elements this production had in its favor, I really must label ""The Ring"" and ""Grudge"" as the two superior films. Like many reviewers here, I saw far too many similarities in plot structure and writing. I pretty much had the entire story summed up two quarters of the way through, and therefore felt no emotional connection to the film's final moments. Telegraphing plot shifts, especially in a motion picture of this magnitude, should never be this simple. The mood, the intricate camera shots, and acting was all there in perfect place. But, ultimately, I found the script required major tweaking in order to avoid these slightly more-than-obvious comparisons. And, as an unfortunate result, I sat through the credit roll with extreme disappointment.Jennifer Connelly delivered a fairly sound and respectable performance. I only wish she had passed on this project and settled for a far less derivative screenplay. I already hold ""The Ring"" in high regard and had never intended on having to endure another variation of the same exact story.

They rent an apartment in a kind of dank, run-down building. There are continuous leaks of dark water from the apartment above and also strange noises. The daughter becomes obsessive over an imaginary friend that has something to do with the apartment upstairs. It turns out there was a little girl who lived there who disappeared a few weeks earlier and no one knows what happened to her. It all ties in with Connelly's issues with her own mother and she begins to wonder if she is going crazy. The water leaks are blamed on a few teenagers that live in the building and Connelly sees her husband talking to these boys. She wonders if he is paying them to mess with her to help in the custody fight.The movie does make you wonder if the things that are happening are supernatural or a set-up and it is a stylish movie to look at. The performances are also first-rate. However, the movie ultimately fails because except for last ten minutes, and one creepy scene in particular, there is no tension or fear. Things happen at a very slow pace and there isn't anything frightening about them for the viewer. The first hour and a half of the movie are dull and it does not build, it just sits there.

933870,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000AWYOGE,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 3]","When it comes down to horror movies, you can either have the types that are more preoccupied with portraying creepy atmospheres and foreboding tension. But then you get the type, which is kind of where we're stuck now, where violence is emphasized - more specifically, graphic carnage-like violence. So when you see a film like Dark Water, you get the feeling that you're going to watch the former right? Well turns out you're getting something a little different and if you're aware of this before watching you might like it.Dahlia Williams is a recently separated woman in a custody battle with her husband over daughter Cecilia. Getting an apartment on Roosevelt Island, Dahlia's problems seem to get worse as the apartment is in rather poor condition, notably a leak in the bedroom. But then, Cecilia starts to talk of an imaginary friend and the apartment upstairs seems to be frequently full of movement and water. But with a husband out to gain sole custody, is she just made out to look crazy or is there something upstairs?Watching a horror film, you genuinely want to feel creeped out and almost be on edge. I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt strange after watching a horror movie, like noises aren't just simply noises and whatnot. Dark Water on the other hand is not a horror movie so much as it is a psychological kind of film where it's a more slower-based tension and relatively light on jump scenes. In fact, what little scares there is they feel somewhat, excuse the pun, ""watered down"", as if the studio didn't want the film to be too scary or more focused on boo scenes than atmosphere. While the film does have a more slower pace which is rather atypical of the more wham-bam style that we've been seeing lately but it feels like a psychological film mixed with a horror film but trying to figure out which one to use when. As such it feels sort of disjointed and pulled from 2 directions.But just because it might not fit a horror or thriller genre doesn't mean it has to have bad acting too. Led primarily by Jennifer Connelly, she's given the most screen time and luckily she's sympathetic and able to lend gravitas to a character when they're normally known for being either shrieking violets or just sad sacks that cry all the time. It helps too that she's supported by known character actors such as John C. Reilly (Boogie Nights), Pete Postlethwaite (Usual Suspects) Dougray Scott (Mission: Impossible 2), Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs) and Camryn Manheim (tv's The Practice). They're not really flashy roles but they don't feel useless either.Is it a film that you should check out? Well, that is if you know what you'r'e getting into. Wanting to see a horror movie, or a character-based psychological film? If it's the former, you'll be disappointed but it's the latter you might find that you'll like it.",3,Read before you watch,1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,2833,"['When', 'down', 'horror', 'movies', 'can', 'either', 'have', 'types', 'are', 'more', 'preoccupied', 'portraying', 'creepy', 'atmospheres', 'foreboding', 'tension', 'then', 'get', 'type', 'kind', 'where', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'now', 'where', 'violence', 'emphasized', 'more', 'specifically', 'graphic', 'carnage-like', 'violence', 'So', 'when', 'see', 'film', 'Dark', 'Water', 'get', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'former', 'right', 'Well', 'out', ""'re"", 'getting', 'something', 'little', 'different', ""'re"", 'aware', 'watching', 'might', 'like', 'it.Dahlia', 'Williams', 'recently', 'separated', 'woman', 'custody', 'battle', 'husband', 'daughter', 'Cecilia', 'Getting', 'apartment', 'Roosevelt', 'Island', 'Dahlia', 'problems', 'seem', 'get', 'worse', 'apartment', 'rather', 'poor', 'condition', 'notably', 'leak', 'bedroom', 'then', 'Cecilia', 'talk', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'apartment', 'upstairs', 'be', 'frequently', 'full', 'movement', 'water', 'husband', 'gain', 'sole', 'custody', 'just', 'made', 'out', 'look', 'crazy', 'there', 'something', 'upstairs', 'Watching', 'horror', 'film', 'genuinely', 'want', 'feel', 'creeped', 'out', 'almost', 'be', 'edge', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'felt', 'strange', 'watching', 'horror', 'movie', 'noises', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'simply', 'noises', 'whatnot', 'Dark', 'Water', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'psychological', 'kind', 'film', 'where', 'more', 'slower-based', 'tension', 'relatively', 'light', 'jump', 'scenes', 'fact', 'what', 'little', 'scares', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'pun', 'watered', 'down', 'studio', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'film', 'be', 'too', 'scary', 'more', 'focused', 'boo', 'scenes', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'have', 'more', 'slower', 'pace', 'rather', 'atypical', 'more', 'wham-bam', 'style', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seeing', 'lately', 'psychological', 'film', 'mixed', 'horror', 'film', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'use', 'when', 'such', 'sort', 'disjointed', 'pulled', '2', 'directions.But', 'just', 'might', 'not', 'fit', 'horror', 'thriller', 'genre', ""n't"", 'mean', 'have', 'bad', 'acting', 'too', 'Led', 'primarily', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'given', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'luckily', 'sympathetic', 'able', 'lend', 'gravitas', 'character', 'when', ""'re"", 'normally', 'known', 'being', 'shrieking', 'violets', 'just', 'sad', 'sacks', 'cry', 'time', 'too', 'supported', 'known', 'character', 'actors', 'such', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'tv', 'Practice', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'flashy', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'useless', 'either.Is', 'film', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'Well', 'know', 'what', 'r', 'e', 'getting', 'Wanting', 'see', 'horror', 'movie', 'character-based', 'psychological', 'film', 'former', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'latter', 'might', 'find', ""'ll"", 'like']",N/A

Every role was well cast. I especially like the persons in the minor roles -- the &#34;super,&#34; slumlord, lawyer, and preschool teacher were very well played by veteran actors. The mother and daughter were also well acted. The father's character was somewhat flat -- and the actor did nothing to remedy that. This was the only weak spot with respect to acting.The main problem with the film is the ending. But, since it was adapted from a book, I can't blame the people involved with producing the movie. If I had read the book, I would have hated seeing a different ending. So, once the decision is made to turn a book into a movie, you just can't get away with major plot changes -- like rewriting the ending. I think the ending takes away a whole lot of promise from the movie. I was about to give it a 4.5 -- but now, it gets a 3.5, rounded up due to the harsh and melodramatic 1 and 2-star ratings. Grow up people!The ending seems to play on gender stereotypes. Also, it is very sudden. Finally, the ending masquerades as a good solution -- when it is quite dreadful. Notice the girl smiling. Why? There's nothing cheerful about the ending. Perhaps they should have used more input from women all along. This is a very male-oriented production, with women characters.

933874,A2CCWUHE0Q4G1M,B000AWYOGE,Doran Steele,"[2, 3]","After seeing other Hollywod remakes of ""J-Horror"" offerings, I was prepared for a scary and unsettling film when I saw Dark Water.  The Ring, and to a slightly lesser extent The Grudge, have shown that it is possible successfully to translate Japanese horror films for American audience.  Each of these previous films manages to create disturbing images and creepy atmospheres that stay with the viewer long after the film ends.  Unfortunately, Dark Water doesn't manage to reach the bar set by these other films.One of the biggest problems of with Dark Water is that we've seen so much of it before.  In fact, I would even say that the script of Dark Water feels like they took the script from The Ring, stripped away all of the terrifying and creepy elements, but kept the same dynamic between the two core characters.  Then they changed a couple of details and then fleshed out the story about what would happen between the two characters if the film were going for a more mysterious and ponderous tone than the chills and horror found in the Ring.  Let's see compare details from the two films for a moment... there's the key role of parental abandonment, the role of mental illness, the prominent role of a water storage/supply device for a grave plot development (and the setting for a climatic scene), the arrival of a new potential mother figure, the imperilment of the new mother figure's child...  Doesn't this all sound kind of familiar?  The film also lifts some elements from The Grudge--see, for example, the scene when the main character rides the elevator and sees a surprising face through the elevator door's window.  This was played to creepy effect in the Grudge, but in Dark Water this feels rehashed.Maybe one could forgive these similarities if the film was done really well.  A significant problem of the film is that the atmosphere isn't that creepy or scary or tense.  Yeah, there's dark water on the ceiling and intermitant the sounds of dripping water and other spooky noises, but it comes of more as unpleasant than scary.  Some of the most unsettling scenes of the film are so obviously dream sequences that they don't deliver chills because the audience knows that the character will wake up.  Many of the water-logged dream sequences seem to borrow more from Tarkovsky's film The Mirror than actual horror films.  (Tarkovsky was a great film maker, but his work doesn't seem to be the best place to be looking for inspiration for a horror film.)  The film makers try to surprise the viewers with the standard fake-out ""boo!"" moments, but they just don't work.  I'm sorry, but the spooky gurgling of a malfunctioning washing machine doesn't deliver enough tension to make us ""surprised"" when the main character closes the washing machine door and someone is there waiting behind the door.  Plus, most of the film seems to be focused on the struggles of being a recently-divorced single mother in New York City rather than the ghost story that brought us to the movie.The film is most effective the times when the film makers go for subtlety.  During the course of the film, the main character begins to question her own sanity just as she happens to move into a concrete-slab apartment building that evokes a bleak institutional mental hospital.  In addition, the shades and blinds draw lines over the windows so it almost looks like there are bars on the windows.  These subtle touches are probably the most effective part of the film.The film is least effective in terms of the plot structure.  The similarities between the main character's life story and that of the dead little girl are way too close and way too convenient.  I mean, they should have gone with the main character being mentally ill and projecting her own life story onto an imagined ""ghost"" rather than making it so that the two characters lead almost exactly the same life.  Also, don't these similarities make it just too convenient for the ghost that a young woman with almost her exact life story who also has a young daughter exactly the age of the ghost when she died just happen to move into the apartment below where the ghost used to live?  If they had been more subtle about all of this, it would have been a lot more effective.  Plus, the idea that the little girl's new imaginary friend is really the ghost, well, that's just too cliche to comment upon.  Finally, the ""happy"" ending feels wrong--didn't the main character learn anything from the experience of the ghost?Bottom line:If you were expecting the edge-of-your-seat terror of The Ring or even of The Grudge, then this will be a disappointing film.  On the other hand, if you want a mildy spooky ghost story involving a single mother struggling to make ends meet after a recent divorce--and you want to watch a Hollywood remake of a J-Horror film without actually getting scared--then you will probably enjoy this film.",2,Not very scary J-Horror remake,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,4892,"['seeing', 'other', 'Hollywod', 'remakes', 'J-Horror',

933876,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B000AWYOGE,dv_forever,"[4, 5]","This is a remake of a Japanese film from 2002 with the same title. The original was directed by Hideo Nakata. This American ""Dark Water"" from 2005 is directed by Walter Salles, a Brazilian filmmaker who goes completely Hollywood with this production. I admit I haven't seen the original Japanese Dark Water but I can't imagine it's a better looking film than this.I originally saw this movie in the theaters while visiting Manhattan in the summer of 2005. It's crazy just how many Hollywood films are set in New York. Don't New Yorkers get sick and tired of seeing their city plastered across the screen in every other movie? Who knows... perhaps they love it. This film doesn't actually take place on Manhattan proper but instead on the residential Roosevelt Island, which is linked to Manhattan by a connecting bridge. In the opening scene of the film we see Jennifer Connelly's character and her daughter crossing from Manhattan to the island via a lift. The visuals are immediately arresting even during the opening credits. I very much appreciate terrific cinematography, even for it's own sake and Dark Water does not disappoint on that front. It's got all the trappings of a glossy Hollywood movie. Connelly, who is frequently a terrific actress, seems to specialize in playing tortured females. Most of the time she's suffering because of the man in her life. In this film, she's a young divorced mother who has found an apartment for her and her daughter on Roosevelt Island, a location I haven't really seen in movies. With it's somewhat dilapidated apartment complexes, this story has a great atmosphere. It's not really a horror film, rather it just envelops the viewer in it's sinister locations.The plot isn't much and the writing is full of the typical cliches taken from this well worn genre. The new apartment they move into is apparently haunted by some ghostly presence that has a bizarre interaction with water. The young mother begins to lose her mind little by little until the big climax where the viewers get the inevitable revelation of the ghost's motivations for haunting the environment in which the characters reside. I can't recommend Dark Water for anything other than it's cinematography and first rate production design.

933877,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,B000AWYOGE,Dwight,"[1, 4]",I avoided this remake because I preferred the Japanese Ju On to the American Grudge but catching part of the Japanese Dark Water interested me enough to watch the American Dark Water.  The American Dark Water is much much better than the American Grudge.  The American Dark Water can stand on its own as a watchable movie and another strong understated performance from Jennifer Connelly.  I like the small movies with the excellent casts like Dark City and Slipping Down Life so this movie is to my taste although I did fast forward the middle after suffering the very realistic desperate apartment hunter on a budget in Manhattan at the mercy of the merciless real estate purveyor.  And is that the real Roosevelt Island?  The depiction of Roosevelt Island makes a lot more sense than the glowing advertisments.  Didn't Roosevelt Island originally house the criminally insane? Not exactly the hop and skip from Bloomingdale's that one would have in mind.The ending made me tear up but surprisingly the Japanese Dark Water ending did not.

There are no cliched jump scares, just a snowballing chilling effect that sets this apart from other recent Asian Horror remakes and horror movies in general.The cast's acting is above average. John C. Reilly, as usual, stands out, acts rings around a sometimes, but not often, lost Jennifer Connelly. Good acting really can make a pedestrian movie better.The Bad -- Enough with the water! The director repeatedly beats the viewer in the head with water images that by the sixth or seventh time, it becomes tired and trite.There's no reason why this movie needed to run longer than 90 minutes. All the characters and situations are established early on; there are no real character arcs. Perhaps if the editing was more tight, then the lack of any character development could have been ignored and the water motifs and general suspense would have been more effective.The Ugly -- The final resolution to the haunting. First, it's preceded by a false resolution similar to The Ring. Second, it comes out of nowhere, being neither shocking nor logical. The only evidence that foretells the resolution is circumstantial.

The first time I watched this movie I was expecting something along the lines of ""The Ring"" or maybe the ""The Grudge"" but was pleasantly surprised when this one seemed more surreal. It does an excellent job with the characters and makes the story seem very believable. I had a good time with this one when with others I was really not much of a fan.Dahlia and her daughter Cecelia are looking for a new apartment on Roosevelt Island in New York City, Cecelia needs to live close to a good school it seems. Dahlia has a new job and at the same time is going through a divorce with a husband that does not trust her judgment. Once they find a place strange things start to happen like a constant water leak that is in her daughter's room. Also add in the strange noises coming from the place above her place and you have a cool little film a brewing. Of course you can't forget that this is a mystery/ghost story at heart.Director Walter Salles does a nice job in letting the story tell its self instead of pushing things along at a fast pace. He also elects to let the characters build on them selves and actually develop, that seems rare now a days. Also writer Rafael Yglesias [also a writer on the Johnny Depp flick ""From Hell] did a nice job in this American version. To be completely honest with you I was not expecting a ghost story like this one from this one. I really felt that it would look like every other remake that has come out since ""The Ring"".The thing that really makes this film interesting is the acting from this top notch cast, every one did a good job on this one. Jennifer Connelly is great as Dahlia Williams and makes the character seem like an actual person. Her daughter is played by Ariel Gade who like Jennifer does a great job which is rare for child actors, especially in this type of film. Of course the ever excellent Tim Roth is brilliant in this film as a lawyer who actually comes to this lady's aid when she needs it. John C. Reilly may steal the show some what as the shady land lord who always makes a promise he can not keep. Dougray Scott, Pete Postlethwaite, and Camryn Manheim all also give excellent performances.As the film goes on it goes from being about pesky neighbors to a ghost story to a crime mystery and it still manages to feel like the same film. This is not the best movie ever and may not be for every body but it definitely will appeal to some. I would recommend this one to any fan of mystery films or ghost stories.

933886,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000AWYOGE,Galina,"[3, 4]","Dark Water, the first English language movie directed by Brazilian Walter Salles (Central Station, Motorcycle Diaries) is a very good movie. This is the type of intelligent non-slasher horror films that I enjoy. Its power is not in showing gore and roaring monsters but in the creating the atmosphere of unbearable tension and in making the very familiar everyday things and situations ominous, gloomy, and ready to hurt. Dark Water is also about very real and sympathetic characters, a young single mother and her little girl, and the bond and love between them. It is about real monsters of abuse, negligence, and criminal indifference that could and would affect a child's future life and lead to the tragic event at some point. I did not see the original Japanese movie of which Dark Water is a remake but I found this remake set in the creepiest apartment building on the Roosevelt Island, NY imaginable, a very underrated, good on its own merits and certainly worth watching drama/psychological thriller with the elements of supernatural thriller. Acting is first class. Jennifer Connelly in a truly heartbreaking performance as a recently divorced woman trying to move on together with her little daughter deserves a special mention and respect. John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, Pete Postlethwait, and Dougray Scott all made their characters interesting and memorable. It was nice to see Camryn Manheim in a small cameo. Two young girls also were very good. The camera work by Alfonso Beato, who more recently shot the award winning films ""All About My Mother"" (1999) ""Ghost World"" (2001), ""The Queen"" (2006), and ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" is amazing. The apartment where Dahlia and Cecil moved, had a strong and scary personality, and could be consider another very important film's character. If I add that the original music to the film was written by Angelo Badalamenti, the usual David Lynch's collaborator, you'd have a good idea of the surreal dark atmosphere of the film. I recommend it but do not expect a pure horror flick.

933887,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000AWYOGE,General Zombie,"[1, 3]","'Dark Water' is most notable simply because it actually defies expectations to some degree.  Make no mistake, it's definitely another modern ghost movie, but it takes a more character driven and more purely dramatic approach, so much so that up until the very latest portions of the film the supernatural aspects are almost a subplot.  The film is actually primarily character driven, focusing on the central Dahlia character and her daughter most of all, but still leaving plenty of room for the various minor characters.  Honestly, from a purely practical standpoint, we don't need to know these people as well as we come to, but this, along with the slow plotting of the film, helps generate a greater sense of reality and an overall expansiveness. I don't think this formula would work if it were repeated, horror films simply need to be more horrific then this as a whole, but for a lone attempt it's a fairly different, quite effective experience.'Dark Water' is a remake of a Hideo Nakata film from 2002. This strikes me as a peculiar film to rework, as it is a fairly effective but ultimately unremarkable film.  Also, the original 'Dark Water' has cash-in written all over it:  It's a 'Ringu' rehash directed by the maker of said film, based on a short story by Koji Suzuki, who wrote the original novel on which 'Ringu' is based.  Of course, the remake has got cash-in written all over it too, as well as the mark of the various `Ring' films: Roughly 1/3 of the plot of this film is simply recycled from `Ring/Ringu' while the American `Ring Two' (also directed by Nakata) lifted about a third of `Dark Water's plot.  (And, perhaps more significantly they have most of the same themes and motifs i.e. Girl-ghosts, water, motherhood etc.)  Still, `Dark Water' manages to seem far less reiterative simply by reworking the focus, downplaying the supernatural and emphasizing the human.The film opens with a meeting between Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her soon to be ex husband Kyle (Dougray Scott).  It's hard to think of any divorce being to pleasant, but things are obviously bound to get prett tough here.  This separation means that Dahlia needs to find a new home, and shortly after this meeting she and her 6 year old daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade) move into a nasty, ultra-bland and rundown apartment complex on Roosevelt Island.  (My brother said this place reminded him of the Soviet built apartments he'd seen in Russia and you can totally imagine that; it's designed to be purely functional and not aesthetically pleasing, though it frankly is something of a failure in the former respect as well.)  This place has got a load of problems, the most disturbing one being the dark, viscous looking water leaking from the ceiling, and strange sound emanate from the supposedly empty apartment above.The film essentially follows the day to day life of Dahlia and Ceci, as things get increasingly weird and difficult:  Ceci soon acquires an imaginary friend whom she vehemently insists is real; Dahlia, who  has an ill-defined history of mental illness, begins to have disturbing dreams and to hear distant voices;  the divorce grows increasingly hostile and Dahlia suspects Kyle is trying to maker her look paranoid, all while the apartment continues to fall apart around them.  This all eventually comes to a head, but not until the final half hour, and I'm sure plenty of people will  lose patience with it.  It kept me interested, though, through the fine performances and stylish direction.Jennifer Connelly is the center of the film, and she does a fine job.  Salles wisely refuses to turn her into a saint, allowing her to be fairly flawed and human, and ultimately more sympathetic.  Ariel Gade is your typical cute Hollywood kid, but what can I say, she's legitimately cute and the bonding scenes between her and Connelly seem very real.  There are also three fine supporting roles from Pete Postelthwaite, John C. Reilly and Tim Roth.  Reilly is the best of them as the total sleaze ball owner of the complex.  He spends the whole film endlessly praising the wretched apartments and dodging Dahlia's complaints.  I couldn't help but like him a little; sure he's slime, but it's his job and he's good at it.  Pete Postelthwaite plays his standard role, the funny-looking foreigner.  He's Veeck, the apartment caretaker something, and Postelthwaite makes him a more interesting character than he has any right to be.  Tim Roth is perhaps the most inexplicable of all of them as Dahlia's lawyer Jeff Platzer.  He takes an odd personal interest in Dahlia's life, yet lies to her constantly for no apparent reason.  One can't help but suspect that he has a romantic in her (I mean who wouldn't, ehh [nudgenudge].... even if she is crazy, so what....) but this doesn't go anywhere.  Anyway, this film is a real testament to how committed acting can bring life and significance to minor roles.This is an extraordinarily depressing looking film, filled with perpetual rain and a color palette extending from dirty brown to rust red.  Roosevelt island is just such a great locale as it is a total industrial wasteland.  It's a block from `Eraserhead' somehow made real.  The film is shot fairly elegantly, though the camerawork and staging are generally fairly unobtrusive.  One major exception to this rule are the dream sequences, which have a bit of flair and choppy editing, alongside some neat effects, like melting walls and whatnot.  Again, the ghostly stuff is fairly by the book, but it's sharply executed.  The climax is somewhat underwhelming but perhaps this is appropriate considering the low-key flavor of the film.  The denouemont is too heavy handed, but it's not that big of deal.Anyway, this is a fairly interesting, well-executed movie.  It's not liable to blow you away, but it's interesting and immersive.  Definitely worth a look if you're into this kinda thing.Grade: B",4,"Man, that apartment is almost as bad as mine...",1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,5904,"[""'Dark"", 'Water', 'most', 'notable',

933888,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B000AWYOGE,Ghoulie Guru,"[10, 13]","Of all the recent remakes of Japanese horror films, I have to say that Dark Water is the only remake that actually surpasses the original. I think the reason that so many people are so hard on it is because they went in expecting to see THE RING or THE GRUDGE. They went in expecting to see a scary ghost movie. Dark Water is not really a horror movie, at least not in the traditional sense. It's actually more of a drama set in a haunted apartment complex. If you go in expecting to have stuff jump out at you, you will be disappointed.It's sad that everyone expects horror films to have a bunch of jump scares in them these days. Whatever happened to the slow buildup of tension and paranoia of something like ROSEMARY'S BABY. If you go into Dark Water expecting something more akin to Rosemary's Baby, you might just end up enjoying this film.As far as comparing this remake to the original, I will say that I felt that Jennifer Connelly was a much more compelling character than the mother in the original movie. Overall, the characters were fleshed out better. I understood the conflict between the mother, the father and the little girl much more in the remake. The original just sort of glanced over many of these details. Some of the shots were actually more effective than the ones in the original, and the ending in the remake is more satisfying and better executed than in the original. Generally, I think that J-horror is better left in its original incarnation. As much as I liked the Western version of THE RING, I felt like the only reason they remade it was to cast Naomi Watts as the lead. THE GRUDGE, they should have left that one alone. Nothing was gained by Sarah Michelle Gellar. But this one, this one is actually better than the Japanese original in my opinion.This movie is not for everyone. It is a slow, poignant drama set in a really creepy location. It would probably play well in a double feature with ROSEMARY'S BABY. If you want to have stuff jump out at you, watch THE GRUDGE. If you want to watch a movie that has a little more depth to it, watch DARK WATER.",4,Dark Water Has Depth,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,2092,"['recent', 'remakes', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'say', 'Dark', 'Water', 'only', 'remake', 'actually', 'original', 'think', 'reason', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'hard', 'went', 'expecting', 'see', 'THE', 'RING', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'went', 'expecting', 'see', 'scary', 'ghost', 'movie', 'Dark', 'Water', 'not', 'really', 'horror', 'movie', 'least', 'not', 'traditional', 'sense', 'actually', 'more', 'drama', 'set', 'haunted', 'apartment', 'complex', 'go', 'expecting', 'have', 'stuff', 'jump', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.It', 'sad', 'everyone', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'bunch', 'jump', 'scares', 'days', 'happened', 'slow', 'buildup', 'tension', 'paranoia', 'something', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'go', 'Dark', 'Water', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'akin', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'might', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'enjoying', 'film.As', 'far', 'comparing', 'remake', 'original', 'will', 'say', 'felt', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'character', 'mother', 'original', 'movie', 'Overall', 'characters', 'were', 'fleshed', 'out', 'better', 'understood', 'conflict', 'mother', 'father', 'little', 'girl', 'much', 'more', 'remake', 'original', 'just', 'sort', 'glanced', 'many', 'details', 'shots', 'were', 'actually', 'more', 'effective', 'ones', 'original', 'ending', 'remake', 'more', 'satisfying', 'better', 'executed', 'original', 'Generally', 'think', 'J-horror', 'better', 'left', 'original', 'incarnation', 'As', 'much', 'liked', 'Western', 'version', 'THE', 'RING', 'felt', 'only', 'reason', 'remade', 'was', 'cast', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'lead', 'GRUDGE', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'one', 'alone', 'Nothing', 'was', 'gained', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'one', 'one', 'actually', 'better', 'Japanese', 'original', 'opinion.This', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'slow', 'poignant', 'drama', 'set', 'really', 'creepy', 'location', 'would', 'probably', 'play', 'well', 'double', 'feature', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'want', 'have', 'stuff', 'jump', 'out', 'watch', 'GRUDGE', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'watch', 'DARK', 'WATER']",N/A
933889,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000AWYOGE,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Walter Salles has proven himself a formidable director with his successes in 'Central Station', Behind the Sun', and The Motorcycle Diaries': he is an artist unafraid to approach unfamiliar terrain in his growth as a director, yet always proving that the most important element in making a good film is to explore the characters more than just the atmosphere.  Those who find faults with DARK WATER seem to be concentrating on critiques of special effects and manufactured terror machines. Where Salles succeeds in this adaptation of the original Japanese film by Kji Suzuki (novel) and Hideo Nakata (director) is his concentration on developing interesting and strange people, characters with whom we can identify and thus whose encounters with the 'unknown' feel more intensely internal.The story has been related ad infinitum: Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her daughter Cecelia (Ariel Gade) move from Manhattan away from her recently estranged husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) to a creaky apartment building on Roosevelt Island to the benefit of real estate agent Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly) and under the suspicious eye of building super Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite).  The building and the constant rain are ominous from the start but soon strange events happen that suggest either mental decline of both Dahlia and Ceci or the presence of ghosts.  The title of the film describes not only the bleak atmospheric element that drives the story but also the netherworld that admixes surrealistic phenomena with psychosis. Characters enter the story naturally and comfortably: Jeff Platzer (Tim Roth) offers his legal defense of Dahlia in a manner that belies his mode of existence; Ceci's Teacher (Camryn Manheim) brings reality testing to the fuzzy world of imaginary friends; Alison Sealy-Smith as a supervisor where Dahlia seeks work is one of Dahlia's few kind encounters.Though the pacing seems slow it does march like the descent of a mind into the unknown and Salles manages that well. The film's cinematography by Affonso Beato maintains the grunge effect that intensifies the terror and Angelo Badalamenti has provided a musical score that bears just the right amount of supportive suspense.  But as with other Salles movies the work is supported by truly fine acting and once again Jennifer Connelly proves she can convey much with very little.  Give this film a chance, without comparisons to other films of the genre, and see what Walter Salles can do with a story.

I saw some of the Japanese film and could not get into it.  Interestingly enough, I had a hard time getting into this version as well, but I did sit through it.  To say ""Dark Water"" is not scary would be an understatement.  Although the acting is decent, the atmosphere in ""Dark Water"", while certainly present, is largely ineffective at producing any horror or scares in the audience resulting in a totally uncompelling attempt at a horror movie.Some people may argue that ""Dark Water"" is more of a suspense/mystery movie (I agree) rather than a horror movie, but the movie comes off as incredibly boring and predictable in that regard as well.  The only thing that even raises an eyebrow is the ending, and even that was rather anti-climactic.

933896,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,B000AWYOGE,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[2, 3]","Ahh, Dark Water...a suspense film that revolves around an insipid substance people drink and bathe in daily.  See a problem already?  If there is a way to make this plot suspenseful, frightening or at least interesting, the director certainly did not discover it.The film tells the story of Dahlia, a 30 something mother in the midst of a nasty divorce.  Faced with living on a reduced income, Dahlia and her predictably overmature for her age 6 year old daughter Cecelia are forced to move into a decidedly less than secure and luxurious apartment building well outside the expensive bounds of Manhattan.  The film explains this puzzling plot point away by citing the ""great school just 2 blocks away.""  This is the first big pill the viewer must swallow.  We are expected to believe that this supposedly devoted and loving mother would place a good kindergarten program higher on the priority list than her daughter's immediate safety and security.  That's assuming a ""great school"" would even be found in such a crackhead neighborhood.  The teeny bit of backstory the film offers on Dahlia as an abused child makes this particular point even harder to believe.  (Dahlia has implied psychological abandonment issues borne from chidhood memories of her drunken mother's parental negligence and abuse.)  These issues are never really developed or explored meaningfully in the film mind you.  They are simply thrown in to the plot in dreaded flashback form, leaving the viewer to fill in the the details that would have actually added some interesting depth to Dahlia's character.  Sorry Dark Water but moroseness in and of itself does not a character make.Soon after Dahlia and Cecilia arrive at the dumpy apartment building strange things begin happening.  A child's back pack is found.  The building leaks.  Pretty scary huh?  The elevator and buttons malfunction.  Ooooh, I'm getting chills just thinking about it.  The faucets occasionally spew out nasty looking water for no apparent reason.  I'm on the edge of my seat!The building super is predictably a cranky old gank.  But he inexplicably sways back and forth between being callous and helpful to Dahlia with no rhyme or reason.  Ultimately his character proves pointless and completely unnecessary to the events in the story, especially given how much space he is given in it.  That is not to say he isn't involved in the story.  He is.  But what occurs in the story really does not at all require his presence to play out.An equally shallow and pointless character is Dahlia's lawyer, who pops into scenes from time to time behaving more like a guardian angel/psychologist/marriage counselor than a legal advisor.  New York lawyers are afterall, so very prone to going above and beyond the call of duty for the destitute, slum-living, 30 something, head case mothers they represent.The final undoing of the film is the tortuously slow manner in which it moves from scene to scene.  There is no arc, no real point.  Just a lot of ominous music that tells you when a suspenseful moment is around the corner and creeping about in apartments over and over again.  What little suspense is created early in the film begins to wither away proportionately as the viewer's weariness grows.  Film making 101 tells you that in order to have sustained suspense a story must have arc.  Dark Water is pure flatline from start to finish.Eventually, there is a convoluted explanation for the happenings in the building and a predictable, pointless ending that I won't give away in this review.  But they are nowhere near satisfying enough to make it worth what the viewer is asked to sit through.Ultimately, Dark Waters leads viewers down the primrose path to nowhere.  This film is just another in a long line of recent big studio films rushed to production with a sorely underdeveloped storyline and screenplay treatment.  Many have reviewed this film as a pretty good work within its genre.  Don't buy that.  There are many better works out there in this genre.

933897,A2PIX2K56IZZYX,B000AWYOGE,Jason W. Kaiser,"[3, 4]","I really was going to give Dark Water 2 stars, but looking back and after arguing with my wife (She really liked it) it's not too bad. I think what swayed me to the 3 star side was the acting, all who are in it do quite well, no over-acting, and with a couple of scene stealers. It seems Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is in the middle of a tense custody battle with her ex, he wants her to move closer to him so they can have joint custody, while she wants to move farther away in the city because it's cheaper. She wins (at first) and her and her daughter move to a dumpy, dreary, run-down apartment building in lower Manhattan. Just so happens there was a little girl who was abused and mis-treated by her parents who eventually died, that lived in the apartment right above Dahlia's. Her ghost is not pleased, and soon takes after Dahlia's daughter as the two of them look identical, and she also wants Dahlia to be her new mother.The first 45 minutes are really boring, it takes the movie way too long to get going, but when it does, the last 45 minutes are pretty entertaining. Also, this movie is way to dark, there is little lighting to speak of, and what lighting there is does the viewer no good cuz' you can't see a thing!! I know dark scenes are important to a horror/mystery movie, but not overkill, okay? And of course this got the dreaded 'unrated' tag, which if you have read any of my previous reviews, you know I'm not a big fan of.........at all.As I said earlier, the cast is strong, Connelly plays Dahlia well, a strong, loving mother, but with so many past demons, a brutal custody battle, and her daughter's imaginary friend, she slowly loses control and begins to question her own sanity. John C. Reilly plays Mr. Murray, the owner of the building who talks Dahlia and her daughter into moving in. He is kind of a sleaze but helps Dahlia out in getting her apartment's many leaks and roof damage fixed (These are curteous of our upset little ghost) Pete Postlethwaite plays Veeck, the building's maintenance man, Pete is a character actor who has been around forever and played in over 45 movies. His character wants to somewhat help, but turns out to be more of a creepy guy who plays into the plot more then you will think. Tim Roth, who I've always liked, plays Dahlia's lawyer Platzer, and he is great. He has a meeting with Dahlia in his car, because his office is being ""painted"" Turns out he has no office and works out of his car, but it's ok, he is still a decent lawyer nad helps in getting Mr. Murray and Veeck to clean up the apartment.Now here is the strongest reason I can give for the 3 stars instead of 2....Ariel Gade, she plays Cici, Connelly's daughter, and she is phenomenal. Besides being absolutely adorable, she is also quite the little actress, and though it doesnt say in the credits, I think she also plays Natasha, the little girl who dies and comes back to take Dahlia and Cici. I say this because they look exactly alike, and that would be something if this little girl was able to play such a strong dual role....I know alot of people like Dakota Fanning, and I do to, she is a hell of an actress, but watch out for this kid, she could really be something.So, ok story, strong cast, very little suspense or horror, I know this is a remake of a popular Japanese movie, and I hear it's much better. I am a huge fan of both The Ring and The Grudge, both remakes of Japanese movies, Dark Water comes nowhere close to those two, but it's worth the 3.79 for a decent nighs's viewing.acting.....4 stars, Connelly and Reilly are terrific, but remember the name Ariel Gadedirecting.....3 stars, Maybe the director of the Japanese version could have improved this a bit.special effects....3 stars, Lots and lots of water....too much waterhorror rating....2.5 stars, Very little scares and chills, a few creepy moments, but generally pretty slowquality.....2.5 stars, Way to dark!!!

And in my opinion the book has much better stories. They managed to make a decent movie out of it, however, it is not one of the best scary flicks I 've seen recently and here are the reasons why: The story is similar too the ""Ring"" ; a dead girl locked up in a place with lots of water comes to torment the living... Even more, this movie resembles ""the Ring 2""(which was pretty bad) since the ghost wants a new mother...So nothing new, no surprises. The director managed to capture the old grim industrial landscape of Roosevelt island which makes the movie very depressing. Jennifer Connelly was also great in it, fantastic actress, can't say the same about the little girl and the guy who plays her ex ( seems he needed more diction lessons to achieve a decent American accent)Overall, I would call this a thriller/drama instead of a horror movie since nothing scared me about it.",3,Depressing Thriller,1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,1241,"['have', 'agree', 'average', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'given', 'movie', 'other', 'Amazon.com', 'customers.I', 'read', 'Dark', 'Water', 'watching', 'movie', 'based', 'first', 'short', 'story', 'book', 'Koji', 'Suzuki.When', 'heard', 'were', 'making', 'movie', 'story', 'i', 'was', 'surprised', 'How', 'could', 'make', 'two', 'hour', 'long', 'flick', 'such', 'short', 'story', 'opinion', 'book', 'much', 'better', 'stories', 'managed', 'make', 'decent', 'movie', 'however', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'scary', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'here', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'story', 'similar', 'too', 'Ring', 'dead', 'girl', 'locked', 'up', 'place', 'lots', 'water', 'torment', 'living', 'Even', 'more', 'movie', 'Ring', '2', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'ghost', 'new', 'mother', 'So', 'nothing', 'new', 'surprises', 'director', 'managed', 'capture', 'old', 'grim', 'industrial', 'landscape', 'Roosevelt', 'island', 'movie', 'very', 'depressing', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'fantastic', 'actress', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'little', 'girl', 'guy', 'who', 'ex', 'needed', 'more', 'diction', 'lessons', 'achieve', 'decent', 'American', 'accent', 'Overall', 'would', 'call', 'thriller/drama', 'instead', 'horror', 'movie', 'nothing', 'scared']",N/A

Jennifer Connelly is a middle aged woman struggling through custody battles with her husband over their daughter Ceci. She starts a new life with her daughter in Roosevelt Island right outside Manhattan, the apartment they move into is old and extremely creepy. Leaks and strange noises are just some of the common problems Jennifer Connelly and her daughter encounter. Now in the opening scene of the movie we see Jennifer Connelly as a young girl waiting for her mother to pick her up from school. Unfortunately her mother forgets about her and she is left to wait with her teacher. Now this scene kinda explains why their new apartment is dripping with ""dark water"". Later on we are introduced with the caretaker of the building, he is impolite and very rude. Up above Jennifer Connelly's room was a Russian family with a single daughter also. The two parents assumed that one of them took their daughter with them, we later find out that the father split and went to live with his mother in Russia and the mother ran away. Ceci all of a sudden has trouble adjusting to her new school and talks to an imaginary friend named Natasha, (Russian girl). Ceci begins to know about Jennifer Connelly's poor relationship with her mother. We later find out that the Young abandoned Russian girl died on the rooftop and thats why Jennifer Connelly experienced nightmares and hallucinations. The care taker of the building was aware of this death but covered it up saying she was still alive. He just didn't want to let the cops investigate on this tragic death of the young girl. Tim Roth plays Jennifer Connelly's lawyer who helps her gain custody of Ceci and repair the apartment damages. Now the whole point of this ghost story is that the young Russian girl and Jennifer Connelly both had irresponsible mothers. In other words this ghost story pretty much goes unexplained, not too mention there really isn't any ""jump out of your seat scenes"" althought there is a scene where Jennifer Connelly is wet in a white t-shirt. The movie is well paced and the acting is pretty decent but the whole story line is pretty poor and fails to capture any real suspense.

933913,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000AWYOGE,Kevin Killian,"[3, 4]","DARK WATER's a good horror film, if a bit overlong, and it's fueled by the passionateb performance of Jennifer Connelly as Dahlia, a woman with mother problems of her own and a history of mental instability (or merely migraines)?  Her intensity is mirrored by her little girl, Cecilia (Ariel Gade), who is like a little ""Mini Me"" version of Dahlia, and just as exquisite.  I remember this little girl from INVASION, and I hope the poor thing doesn't grow up with hydrophobia after her exposure to dripping ghoulish water in this film and in that ill-fated Everglades based sci fi series.I kept flashing back to Connelly herself as the world's most beautiful little girl actress, in Dario Argento's giallo PHENOMENA, where she had the strange power to talk to insects and make them obey her.  Just as Dahlia and Cecilia seem to be haunted by the spirit of a little girl ghost turned malevolent by the trauma of being abandoned by her mother and father (and possibly murdered by a building super?), it seemed that Connelly's American schoolgirl in Italy in PHENOMENA was also ""acting out"" from being abandoned by her father, an American movie star on the order of Sylvester Stallone (or Al Pacino).  Thus I think Walter Salles picked out the perfect actress to play the central part in DARK WATER, for so many of his shots recall Jennifer Connelly as a young girl, so that the performance itself is haunted by an earlier performance, and we see like X-rays the bones that made this presence work.I didn't understand if Dougray Scott, whom Dahlia spies talking to two evil teens who menace the building and its occupants, was in cahoots with them for real, perhaps paying them to drive his former wife crazy, or is Dahlia just paranoid?  I'd be sort of paranoid myself, especially if I sat down for a nap and didn't wake up for 24 hours.  Salles and his screenwriters lay on the agony a little thick, but how can they help themselves when they have one of the USA's most expressive actresses to bring their torments to life.  One thing I don't understand about Japanese-based horror films, don't the angry ghosts ever find a shred of happiness, or do they always just want revenge on the living?

933914,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000AWYOGE,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 1]","A million different water references popped up when I first thought of writing this review.  From the standard ""all wet"" cliche to ""drizzly drips,"" I thought of them all.  ""Dark Water"" is, like a thousand other mediocre flicks these last few years, based on a mediocre Japanese horror flick by overrated Japanese writers about a creepy ghostchild that uses the ""boo!"" factor to a tiring degree in an attempt to scare the audience.  I'll admit that ""The Grudge"" actually had a couple of these moments, so did ""The Ring,"" but ""Dark Water"" has none of this.It drips along at a snails pace with only slight hints as to what is exactly going on.  We're thrown off the trail by Jennifer Connelly's character a couple of times when she seems to be losing her mind.  In this film, she's fighting through a really nasty custody case with her ex, and as part of her struggle, she moves into a bleak apartment complex occupied by a wasted Pete Postlethwaite and John C. Reilly.  Both of these actors are ten times better than this film allows them to be, though Reilly manages to toss a little humor into his character.  Dougray Scott is pretty good as the ex, and Tim Roth turns in the top performance as Connelly's caring and daring lawyer.As the story puddles from dull moment to dull moment, Connelly and her daughter begin to have ""experiences.""  The daughter has the most contact with ""something"" in the beginning of the flick, but as it continues, the story centers its focus on Connelly.Unfortunately, this film ends with a literal splash, but not a great splashdown.  Connelly and company were wasted in this boring and uneventful flick.

933917,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000AWYOGE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","I actually saw ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara,"" the 2002 Japanese horror film  (2002) that director Hideo Nakata made from Kji Suzuki's novel I saw this 2005 American remake.  Things have been breaking even for me in that regard when it comes to the recent spate of Japanese ghost stories, what with the ""Ringu"" films and ""Ju-on.""  Of course it is a crap shoot as to whether or not you get to see the better version first.  With ""Dark Water"" I think the American version by director Walter Salles (""Diarios de motocicleta"") is a slightly better made film, but I really liked the coda to the Japanese version more than the ""happy"" ending of this one (""happy"" being very much a relative term under the circumstances).Screenwriter Rafael Yglesias succeeds in Westernizing the story so that viewers unfamiliar with the rules of Japanese ghost stories can get into the spirit of things.  Dahlia Williams (Jennifer Connelly) is recently divorced from Kyle (Dougray Scott) and in a bitter custody battle for their young daughter, Ceci (Ariel Grade), so she moves into an apartment on the ninth floor of an rather dilapidated building on Roosevelt Island.  Dahlia tells Kyle it is because the place is too blocks from a good school, but it is really because it is all she can afford.  Maybe she believes all the shameless salesmanship of the landlord (John C. Reilly) because she has to, but one look at Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite), the building's super, and we know that the place is a hellhole.Kyle claims that Dahlia is an unfit mother because she is mentally unstable.  Does he really think this is true or is it simply gamesmanship?  For that matter, does he really want his daughter or is it payback because Dahlia did not like the fact he is living with another woman?  This is vitally important because divorce in America is the norm, whereas in Japan it is much rarer and has decidedly different cultural significance for the characters.  So ""Dark Water"" plays off against our personal reservoir of divorce horror stories, cinematic or otherwise.  But Dahlia has a more immediate concern: there is a leak in the bedroom ceiling that is dripping black water.  Veeck refuses to fix it and Dahlia begins to wonder what is happening in the apartment above her own that would cause the water spot on the ceiling, especially as it grows bigger and more ominous.Meanwhile, Ceci's new teacher (Camryn Manheim), is concerned that she is ignoring the rest of the kids in class to play with her imaginary friend whose name is Natasha.  Dahlia becomes concerned too when she learns that a young girl named Natasha lived in the building.  Kyle is moving ahead with suing for full custody, forcing Dahlia to hire a new lawyer, Jeff Platzer (Tim Roth), who works out of his car.  By this point in the film everyone and everything is a potential threat to Dahlia, both in terms of her sanity and with regards to her protecting her daughter.  However, in the end, ""Dark Water"" comes down to Dahlia having to make a choice, and it is only in the shift in her motivation that the climax of this film loses some of its power compared to the original (the prologue does not come into play as much as it should at the end given the story changes)..For what would still be considered a horror film even if it is more psychological than supernatural for the most part, ""Dark Water"" has a first-rate cast.  Connelly's best moment usually involve the look in her eyes and nothing she has to say, and casting Grade as her daughter was extremely fortuitous.  Postlethwaite is creepy from start to finish, Reilly does a marvelous job of playing against his previous roles by being so positive, and the almost unrecognizable Roth turns in an outstanding character study as the surprisingly compassionate and competent lawyer.  When a cast can offer the likes of Scott and Manheim in minor roles, you know there is a high bottom to the talent level.  Cinematographer Affonso Beato and composer Angelo Badalamenti create the atmosphere for the horror film, more so than the special effects with all of the titular fluid at the climax, which also speaks to this being an above average horror film and therefore worthy of being checked out.",4,An above average adaptation of another Japanese ghost story,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,4204,"['actually', 'saw', 'Honogurai', 'soko', 'kara', '2002', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', '2002', 'director', 'Hideo', 'Nakata', 'made', 'Kji', 'Suzuki', 'novel', 'saw', '2005', 'American', 'remake', 'Things', 'have', 'been', 'breaking', 'even', 'regard', 'when', 'recent', 'spate', 'Japanese', 'ghost', 'stories', 'what', 'Ringu', 'films', 'Ju-on', 'course', 'crap', 'shoot', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'better', 'version', 'first', 'Dark', 'Water', 'think', 'American', 'version', 'director', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'Diarios', 'de', 'motocicleta', 'slightly', 'better', 'made', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'coda', 'Japanese', 'version', 'more', 'happy', 'ending', 'one', 'happy', 'being', 'very', 'much', 'relative', 'term', 'circumstances', '.Screenwriter', 'Rafael', 'Yglesias', 'Westernizing', 'story', 'viewers', 'unfamiliar', 'rules', 'Japanese', 'ghost', 'stories', 'can', 'get', 'spirit', 'things', 'Dahlia', 'Williams', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'recently', 'divorced', 'Kyle', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'bitter', 'custody', 'battle', 'young', 'daughter', 'Ceci', 'Ariel', 'Grade', 'apartment', 'ninth', 'floor', 'rather', 'dilapidated', 'building', 'Roosevelt', 'Island', 'Dahlia', 'Kyle', 'place', 'too', 'blocks', 'good', 'school', 'really', 'can', 'afford', 'Maybe', 'shameless', 'salesmanship', 'landlord', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'one', 'look', 'Veeck', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'building', 'super', 'know', 'place', 'hellhole.Kyle', 'claims', 'Dahlia', 'unfit', 'mother', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'really', 'think', 'true', 'simply', 'gamesmanship', 'matter', 'really', 'want', 'daughter', 'payback', 'Dahlia', 'did', 'not', 'fact', 'living', 'woman', 'vitally', 'important', 'divorce', 'America', 'norm', 'whereas', 'Japan', 'much', 'rarer', 'decidedly', 'different', 'cultural', 'significance', 'characters', 'Dark', 'Water', 'off', 'personal', 'reservoir', 'divorce', 'horror', 'stories', 'cinematic', 'otherwise', 'Dahlia', 'more', 'immediate', 'concern', 'leak', 'bedroom', 'ceiling', 'dripping', 'black', 'water', 'Veeck', 'fix', 'Dahlia', 'wonder', 'what', 'happening', 'apartment', 'own', 'would', 'cause', 'water', 'spot', 'ceiling', 'especially', 'bigger', 'more', 'ominous.Meanwhile', 'Ceci', 'new', 'teacher', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'concerned', 'ignoring', 'rest', 'kids', 'class', 'play', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'name', 'Natasha', 'Dahlia', 'becomes', 'concerned', 'too', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Natasha', 'lived', 'building', 'Kyle', 'moving', 'ahead', 'suing', 'full', 'custody', 'forcing', 'Dahlia', 'hire', 'new', 'lawyer', 'Jeff', 'Platzer', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'who', 'car', 'point', 'film', 'everyone', 'everything', 'potential', 'threat', 'Dahlia', 'terms', 'sanity', 'regards', 'protecting', 'daughter', 'However', 'end', 'Dark', 'Water', 'down', 'Dahlia', 'having', 'make', 'choice', 'only', 'shift', 'motivation', 'climax', 'film', 'power', 'compared', 'original', 'prologue', 'not', 'come', 'play', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'end', 'given', 'story', 'changes', '..For', 'what', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'considered', 'horror', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'psychological', 'supernatural', 'most', 'part', 'Dark', 'Water', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'Connelly', 'best', 'moment', 'usually', 'involve', 'look', 'eyes', 'nothing', 'say', 'casting', 'Grade', 'daughter', 'was', 'extremely', 'fortuitous', 'Postlethwaite', 'creepy', 'start', 'finish', 'Reilly', 'marvelous', 'job', 'playing', 'previous', 'roles', 'being', 'so', 'positive', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Roth', 'outstanding', 'character', 'study', 'surprisingly', 'compassionate', 'competent', 'lawyer', 'When', 'cast', 'can', 'offer', 'likes', 'Scott', 'Manheim', 'minor', 'roles', 'know', 'high', 'bottom', 'talent', 'level', 'Cinematographer', 'Affonso', 'Beato', 'composer', 'Angelo', 'Badalamenti', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'so', 'special', 'effects', 'titular', 'fluid', 'climax', 'also', 'being', 'above', 'average', 'horror', 'film', 'therefore', 'worthy', 'being', 'checked', 'out']",N/A

""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" took place in a city setting, and managed to eek out a chill or two.  However, this movie fails to break any new territory.  Worse, the plodding pace just failed to keep me interested to the end.Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is in the midst of a bitter divorce with husband Kyle (Dougray Scott).  Caught in the middle is daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade).  Dahlia insists on moving into a building where weird things are constantly happening.  The excitement builds and builds (a little tongue-in-cheek here) as the movie moves between events caused by people and events caused by something that the movie only reveals at the end.  Thrown into this plot goulash is Dahlia's childhood.  Dahlia's mother abandoned her.  We see periodic flashbacks to help us understand Dahlia's actions.There are a bunch of problems with this movie.  First, too much stuff is going on which means absolutely nothing.  The guy in the elevator meant nothing and he failed to advance the plot.  Yes, he did provide information about the elevator going up to the tenth floor and he did note that someone kept obliterating the writing on the elevator buttons.  Big deal; we already knew that information when he showed up.The teenage boys appeared menacing, but the movie wastes yet another opportunity.  I could go on, but I would spoil the whole movie for you, in the event that you decide to watch this snoozer.The movie did finally wake from its slumber and provide us with a few tense, generally predictable, moments.  However, those few moments were insufficient compensation for the nearly hour and a half wait.  Incidentally, my wife predicted the end of the movie about halfway through it, beating me completely.  After she pointed out the probable ending, I suddenly realized that this movie was terribly obvious the whole time.  Of course, my wife already realized that.I watched the ""unrated widescreen edition,"" which was supposed to be scarier than what was shown in the theaters.

Something gave me an urge to go to Best Buy. Something made me go to the horror section. I was actually looking for the classic When A Stranger Calls but could not find it. Then I saw it. Something that critics claimed ""was as thrilling as Psycho."" Could that be possible? Now that I actually sat through the two hour dud, maybe I should send the critics a bag of crap in regards to their bluffing. Or maybe I should have gotten the Japanese version.The story here is about a single mother who is at her wits with her ex husband. The two are in a dead lock over the child, as the father wants to move and have his ex wife and daughter relocate close by. Good so far. We feel sympathy for the characters. But unfortunately, it was so unforgettable that a name can't even come to mind.Somewhere in the poverty stricken area, Jennifer Connelly lands an apartment. At first, she isn't too thrilled about it. Lackluster paint job, bizarre people...weird salesman...you name it, it had it wrong. Her daughter finds a Hello Kitty backpack (the first indication something is going wrong?) and that's where the story is supposed to build. In the bedroom the cieling starts to leak. It is believed to be done by two brothers who always break in. Instead, it is some psycho Russian girl who fell in the water tank on the roof and is now haunting the place. Our heroine shares a similarity with the lead character, in the fact that both of their mother's were neglegant towards their child. Fine, I will buy that. But where is the ""jumping out of your seat"" bullcrap that this was hyped about?! The only reason anyone would jump out of their seat is to either take a long cigarette break or to turn the damn DVD off. The ending had a twist where Connelly sacrificed her life for her daughters and ended it on a positive note, but not even God himself would resurrect a movie like this or a sequel.

And being how it isn't original, that is where it comes up lacking.  First off, they push Dark Water at you like it's The Ring or The Grudge or one of those new-fangled hack-slash-scare-and-scream bits of tripe that have been spewing out of the gullet of Hollywood for the past few years.  The New Breed of Horror Flicks.  Well...  The first thing you will realize is that Dark Wateris not scary at all.  I didn't even flinch once.  But once you get past the preconceived notion that you're supposed to be afraid or grossed out or whatever, you realize that Dark Water is actually a pretty good movie.  Filled with dark amosphere and creepy settings, this is definitely not one of those semi-retarded ultra-gore Saw movies.Jennifer Connelly is a recently divorced single mother with past mental issues who finds a place to live in the most god-awfully creepy tenemant in New York.  This place looks like Attica prison turned into condos.  Seriously.  She and her small daughter take an apartment on the ninth floor and everything seems to be going fine.  New school for the daughter.  New job for the mom.  The occasional spat between ex-husband & ex-wife.  And then the leaks begin.This movie is the most straight-forward ghost story you will ever see and when you realize where the story is going, you'll slap yourself in the head.  Duh!  But it does have  freaky ending and that's cool.  Not overly gory.  I like that.  Not that gore bothers me.  When it's used gratuitously for no pupose other than shock-value, that's f*cking irritating.  Definitely a flick worth seeing.  Wouldn't pay full-price for it because it's pretty predictable.  But it's a good mid-range suspense ride.  When you watch the dark, creeping, oozing dark water slittering down from the ceiling, you will cringe.

For a horror movie to have no plot is downright suicidal. The movie fails mostly because it lacks a believable sequence of events. The relationships between the characters are well-developed and the cast is quite good, but there's nothing for them to do. Look scared, be scary, but why?

""Dark Water"" is never meant to be made to target at the younger crowd and thus, the lacklustre result.  Jennifer Connelly's previous movie, ""Hulk"" shared the same fate.  They are good movies but simply underappreciated.  Pete Postelwaite, John C Reilly, Jennifer Connelly were brilliant here but scary moments were far in between.  Towards the half of the movie, we already could guess the end-result and its plot.  As a result, the movie became the victim of the genre's success as it 'educated' the audience of what to expect.

933939,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B000AWYOGE,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[4, 5]","""Dark Water"" is the 2005 remake of the hugely successful Japanese movie, ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"", released in 2002. American remakes of Japanese movies have had varying degrees of success - The Grudge and The Ring, risible sequels notwithstanding, had plenty more good points than bad ones, helping them to stand out from the mire of flash-flash-bang-bang 'horror' movies that Hollywood has deemed fit to release over the last few years.Remakes are a tricky thing to get right: if it goes wrong you end up with what might essentially be a decent movie but is shunned by all and sundry because it's not enough like the original - or else too similar. Gus Van Sant's 'Psycho' immediately springs to mind - a great cast, beautiful direction and an extremely faithful remake which was shot down by critics and the public alike.Which brings us to the first thing I noticed about ""Dark Water"", it's a very, very faithful remake of the Japanese movie, with some truer references to Koji Suzuki's 1998 short story 'Floating Water', which spawned the original film. Jennifer Connelly's character is developed more, we see more reasons for her apparent psychoses and the nature of her relationship with her ex-husband is further developed. Similarly, Ariel Gade as daughter Ceci is a more well-rounded, fully-realised character than Ikuko in the Japanese movie. None of this characterisation spills over into overstatement, either, which is a nice thing.The script is really very good, there's a minumum of schlocky dialogue and next-to-no verbal diarrhoea or monologing, making this movie a refreshing change from so, so many of Hollywood's recent failed attempts at horror - ""Omen 666"" and ""Silent Hill"" immdiately spring to mind as stellar examples of lousy scriptwriting.On the acting front, Connelly and Gade give powerhouse performances as the mother and daughter duo plagued by the supernatural, and I must say, Ariel Gade's performance is one of the best given by a child actor in recent memory. Supporting cast turns are amply provided by the always-watchable John C. Reilly and generally so-so Pete Poistlethwaite. Dougray Scott turns in a great performance as Connelly's ex, his scenes towards the end of the movie make the character more human and more three-dimensional than his Japanese counterpart.Direction is competent, and, in places, very effective. Walter Salles' use of a very desaturated palette and lots of angular shadows lend a real sense of visual isolation to the movie, and, on the whole, ""Dark Water"" is a visually very pleasing movie.So why only two stars? Well, I am sorry to say it, but ""Dark Water"" is just not frightening. It does not achieve what it sets out to do, it does not scare us. And that's a big, big shame, considering that most all of the other elements are very solid. Sadly, no amount of decent acting, good direction and a plausible script can save this movie from the fact that it's lost so, so much in the translation from East to West. What made ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"" so wonderful was perhaps the ambiguity of the characters, their emotional unavailability providing plenty room for the audience's imagination to manouevre. In fleshing the characters out more, ""Dark Water"" removes that ambiguity, and leaves us with a very black-and-white retelling of a story where the grey areas should provide the thrills.Disappointing, but you might enjoy it as a rental?",2,All the ingredients for success but...,1161302400,"10 20, 2006",2006,3415,"['Dark', 'Water', '2005', 'remake', 'hugely', 'successful', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'Honogurai', 'soko', 'kara', 'released', '2002', 'American', 'remakes', 'Japanese', 'movies', 'have', 'had', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'Grudge', 'Ring', 'risible', 'sequels', 'notwithstanding', 'had', 'plenty', 'more', 'good', 'points', 'bad', 'ones', 'helping', 'stand', 'out', 'mire', 'flash-flash-bang-bang', ""'horror"", 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'deemed', 'fit', 'release', 'last', 'few', 'years.Remakes', 'are', 'tricky', 'thing', 'get', 'right', 'wrong', 'end', 'up', 'what', 'might', 'essentially', 'be', 'decent', 'movie', 'shunned', 'sundry', 'not', 'enough', 'original', 'else', 'too', 'similar', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', ""'Psycho"", 'immediately', 'springs', 'mind', 'great', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'direction', 'extremely', 'faithful', 'remake', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'critics', 'public', 'alike.Which', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'Dark', 'Water', 'very', 'very', 'faithful', 'remake', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'truer', 'references', 'Koji', 'Suzuki', '1998', 'short', 'story', ""'Floating"", 'Water', 'spawned', 'original', 'film', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'character', 'developed', 'more', 'see', 'more', 'reasons', 'apparent', 'psychoses', 'nature', 'relationship', 'ex-husband', 'further', 'developed', 'Similarly', 'Ariel', 'Gade', 'daughter', 'Ceci', 'more', 'well-rounded', 'fully-realised', 'character', 'Ikuko', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'None', 'characterisation', 'over', 'overstatement', 'nice', 'thing.The', 'script', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'minumum', 'schlocky', 'dialogue', 'next-to-no', 'verbal', 'diarrhoea', 'monologing', 'making', 'movie', 'refreshing', 'change', 'so', 'so', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'recent', 'failed', 'attempts', 'horror', 'Omen', '666', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'immdiately', 'spring', 'mind', 'stellar', 'examples', 'lousy', 'scriptwriting.On', 'acting', 'front', 'Connelly', 'Gade', 'give', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'mother', 'daughter', 'duo', 'plagued', 'supernatural', 'must', 'say', 'Ariel', 'Gade', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'given', 'child', 'actor', 'recent', 'memory', 'Supporting', 'cast', 'turns', 'are', 'amply', 'provided', 'always-watchable', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'generally', 'so-so', 'Pete', 'Poistlethwaite', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'great', 'performance', 'Connelly', 'ex', 'scenes', 'end', 'movie', 'make', 'character', 'more', 'human', 'more', 'three-dimensional', 'Japanese', 'counterpart.Direction', 'competent', 'places', 'very', 'effective', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'use', 'very', 'desaturated', 'palette', 'lots', 'angular', 'shadows', 'lend', 'real', 'sense', 'visual', 'isolation', 'movie', 'whole', 'Dark', 'Water', 'visually', 'very', 'pleasing', 'movie.So', 'why', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'Well', 'am', 'sorry', 'say', 'Dark', 'Water', 'just', 'not', 'frightening', 'not', 'achieve', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'not', 'scare', 'big', 'big', 'shame', 'considering', 'most', 'other', 'elements', 'are', 'very', 'solid', 'Sadly', 'amount', 'decent', 'acting', 'good', 'direction', 'plausible', 'script', 'can', 'save', 'movie', 'fact', 'lost', 'so', 'so', 'much', 'translation', 'East', 'West', 'What', 'made', 'Honogurai', 'soko', 'kara', 'so', 'wonderful', 'was', 'perhaps', 'ambiguity', 'characters', 'emotional', 'unavailability', 'providing', 'plenty', 'room', 'audience', 'imagination', 'manouevre', 'fleshing', 'characters', 'out', 'more', 'Dark', 'Water', 'ambiguity', 'very', 'black-and-white', 'retelling', 'story', 'where', 'grey', 'areas', 'should', 'provide', 'thrills.Disappointing', 'might', 'enjoy', 'rental']",N/A
933940,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B000AWYOGE,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[5, 6]","I've really enjoyed the recent tendency of horror films to bring traditional stories out of old mansions and creepy cemeteries into our everyday existence -- into the apartments and houses of a modern city.  This urban horror is becoming almost a genre of its own, and it has a way of bringing the fear home in a way that other stories don't.  Along with ""The Ring,"" ""Session 9,"" and ""Creep,"" ""Dark Water"" is a good entry into this growing field.Centering around a run-down apartment building in the most urban of cities -- New York -- the story builds its suspense gradually and skillfully, using our modern conveniences to disturbing ends. From overflowing sinks and toilets to washing machines and a drywall ceiling which won't seem to stop leaking black water, the hints as to what is happening start slow and build to a disturbing crescendo with the climax of the plot.  The film is visually stylish and plays with our perceptions well, allowing the suspense to ebb and flow but never fade completely.The story itself is also uniquely modern, starting with Dahlia Williams and her daughter Julia, freshly separated from Dahlia's ex-husband, moving into the old apartment building on Roosevelt Island because it's near a great school and they can't afford anything better.  The quickly discover that something is wrong in the building, and it infests the very walls -- or more particularly the pipes in the walls.  The nature of what haunts the building and why becomes the central theme, and by the time we discover it, it takes an inevitable toll.  The ending of the story is surprising and impressively emotional, hitting just the right chord without disappointing.The acting is uniformly excellent and convincing, with special attention for Jennifer Connelly in delvering a great performance which never fails to convey what it needs to.  In many ways, the movie depends on Dahlia being convincing in her role as Julia's mother, while dealing with her own issues as well, and Connelly puts out just the right feeling for each scene.All in all, ""Dark Water"" is a creepy, effective, scary movie with an emotional center that may surprise you.  It's not an easy movie -- it has some disturbing themes and will probably leave you thinking about it after the credits have rolled -- but if you like your movies dark and frightening, you could do a lot worse than ""Dark Water.""",4,Fear in the big city,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,2378,"[""'ve"", 'really', 'enjoyed', 'recent', 'tendency', 'horror', 'films', 'bring', 'traditional', 'stories', 'old', 'mansions', 'creepy', 'cemeteries', 'everyday', 'existence', 'apartments', 'houses', 'modern', 'city', 'urban', 'horror', 'becoming', 'almost', 'genre', 'own', 'way', 'bringing', 'fear', 'home', 'way', 'other', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'Along', 'Ring', 'Session', '9', 'Creep', 'Dark', 'Water', 'good', 'entry', 'growing', 'field.Centering', 'run-down', 'apartment', 'building', 'most', 'urban', 'cities', 'New', 'York', 'story', 'suspense', 'gradually', 'skillfully', 'using', 'modern', 'conveniences', 'disturbing', 'ends', 'overflowing', 'sinks', 'toilets', 'washing', 'machines', 'drywall', 'ceiling', 'wo', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stop', 'leaking', 'black', 'water', 'hints', 'what', 'happening', 'start', 'slow', 'build', 'disturbing', 'crescendo', 'climax', 'plot', 'film', 'visually', 'stylish', 'perceptions', 'well', 'allowing', 'suspense', 'ebb', 'flow', 'never', 'fade', 'completely.The', 'story', 'also', 'uniquely', 'modern', 'starting', 'Dahlia', 'Williams', 'daughter', 'Julia', 'freshly', 'separated', 'Dahlia', 'ex-husband', 'moving', 'old', 'apartment', 'building', 'Roosevelt', 'Island', 'great', 'school', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'anything', 'better', 'quickly', 'discover', 'something', 'wrong', 'building', 'very', 'more', 'particularly', 'pipes', 'walls', 'nature', 'what', 'building', 'why', 'central', 'theme', 'time', 'discover', 'inevitable', 'toll', 'ending', 'story', 'surprising', 'impressively', 'emotional', 'hitting', 'just', 'right', 'chord', 'disappointing.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'convincing', 'special', 'attention', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'delvering', 'great', 'performance', 'never', 'convey', 'what', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'Dahlia', 'being', 'convincing', 'role', 'Julia', 'mother', 'dealing', 'own', 'issues', 'well', 'Connelly', 'out', 'just', 'right', 'feeling', 'scene.All', 'Dark', 'Water', 'creepy', 'effective', 'scary', 'movie', 'emotional', 'center', 'may', 'surprise', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'themes', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'thinking', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'like', 'movies', 'dark', 'frightening', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'Dark', 'Water']",N/A
933941,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000AWYOGE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 4]","Dark Water (Walter Salles, 2005)I was all set to write this great review about how Salles had broken the ""brilliant South American directors imported to Hollywood"" jinx, how Dark Water was the best remake of a Japanese New Horror film America had ever seen, with seven hundred or so words waxing philosophic on what it takes to adapt a Japanese flick to American audiences and how Salles and Rafael Yglesias had managed to capture it all so very, very well.Then came the last fifteen minutes of the movie, which I am convinced neither Salles nor Yglesias had anything to do with (and I'm not terribly sure anyone else who made the beginning of the film did, either). It's like an alien EMP washed over the set and clicked everyone's brains off, turning Dark Water from an intelligent, scary film into the kind of preprocessed pablum that Hollywood horror films have been made of, in bulk, since I Walked with a Zombie. (For the record, there is almost no doubt in my mind that the hand of producer Roy Lee was far more involved in the final fifteen minutes of this film than the first ninety.)So I'll do my best to concentrate on the first ninety minutes of the film when writing this review, because you really should see that part of it. After that, turn it off and go rent the original Hideo Nakata film from 2002, which has a far more satisfying ending to it. Besides, you should see all of Nakata's movies, which are uniformly brilliant.Salles (Central Station, The Motorcycle Diaries) and Yglesias (Death and the Maiden) took Taka Ichise (To Sing of Love)'s original script (based on a short story-- not a novel, as both the film and IMDB mistakenly tell you-- by Koji Suzuki, the guy behind Ring) and did a good deal of work on it, which may be the first time since the remake craze began that a script has really been reworked to an extensive degree by a top-notch screenwriter. The end result was good enough to lure some pretty big talent, and it all comes together quite well for an hour and a half.Dahlia (Requiem for a Dream's Jennifer Connelly) is presently going through a divorce from her husband, Kyle (Dougray Scott, from the highly anticipated upcoming TV series Heist) that's getting nasty. Caught between the two is their daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade, of the TV series Invasion). Kyle is moving to Jersey City; Dahlia can't afford that, so she goes looking at project-style apartments on Roosevelt Island. Murray (Gangs of New York's John C. Reilly), a slick used-car type, tries to sell Dahlia on a one-bedroom in a building Ceci describes as ""creepy,"" but by the time they've finished looking at the apartment, Ceci desperately wants to live there. No sooner have they moved in than odd things start happening, all having to do with water.Connelly, Scott, Gade, Reilly, Pete Postlethwaite (The Constant Gardener), Camryn Manheim (The Tenth Kingdom), an utterly unrecognizable Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs), and an even more unrecognizable Elina Lowensohn (The Wisdom of Crocodiles) all turn in wonderful performances in this movie. (Well, okay, every time you see ""this movie"" from here on out, add ""the first ninety minutes of"" beforehand.) The only constants are Connelly and Lowensohn, who plays her mother in flashbacks (the two of them constitute a kind of good-and-evil matrix around whom the rest of the film revolves); everyone else is a variable, and all of them play their variability exceptionally well. The horror-film aspects of what's going on (which become readily apparent within the first half-hour, but I still won't spoil them for you if you haven't seen the original)almost take a backseat to the far more human drama of Dahlia's life, both in the present (the divorce, her harrassment at the hands of a couple of stoner punks who live in the building) and the past (flashbacks to the hatred and ultimate abandonment she suffered at the hands of her alcoholic mother). As it should be.Those of you who have seen the original will no doubt have realized by now that much of what I'm highlighting in the remake was nowhere to be found in the original. And this is what makes the remake of Dark Water such a potentially great film; while it kept the trappings of the original, it is very much its own beast, and Yglesias' script seems almost as if he read through Ichise's original a few times, read Suzuki's story a few times for good measure, then sat down to write the horror version of Kramer vs. Kramer, but without the gratuitous JoBeth Williams nude scene. (Which, I feel compelled to add, Dark Water suffers for lacking.) It's an Yglesias script more than it is an adaptation of an Ichise script, and Yglesias is a great scriptwriter.Of course, none of this holds for the movie's final quarter-hour, which exists solely for the purpose of throwing an a whole bunch of cool special effects, and has none of the atmosphere, pacing, and feeling of denouement as the last quarter-hour of the original script does. If you overlook that, this is a film well worth your time. Unfortunately, it's impossible to overlook. ** ",3,"Ninety minutes of genius, fifteen of suck.",1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,5057,"['Dark', 'Water', 'Walter', 'Salles', '2005', 'was', 'set', 'write',

Pete Postlethwaite is especially good as the building maintenance man - who may or may not be dangerous. Ariel Gade, the prescient little girl, really made the film for me though.

She wasn't the average modern child, distracted with constant trivial wantings and whinings. So she brought a Victorian, 'Turn of the Screw' supernatural intensity to her role.The most unrealistic element of the plot though was the behavior of Jennifer Connelly's attorney.

933945,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000AWYOGE,Samuel McKewon,"[1, 2]","""Dark Water"" is a beautiful, dreary mood piece that wanders around for 90 depressing minutes before it decides it better tell us what in the world's going on. And then it ends. Depressingly. Well, A-plus for consistency.Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) has recently divorced Kyle (Dougray Scott) and moved with her daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade) to a remote, modernist apartment complex on Roosevelt Island in New York City. Dahlia is troubled, near-broke, jilted. Ceci is a cute, opinionated child who wants nothing to do with the apartment until she looks a dark leak in the ceiling and has one of those ghost-induced changes of heart.Who's the ghost? How will it influence Ceci? Why is Dahlia having nightmares about her deadbeat mother? Why are the landlord (John C. Reilly) and superintendent (Pete Postlehewaite) constantly telling Dahlia to call the other to fix her leak? Why does Dahlia's lawyer (Tim Roth) lie about having a family? Will it ever stop raining? Some of these questions have answers. Some of these questions are just used to maintain the movie's disquieting tone.Rafael Yglesias' screenplay works from Hideo Nakata's original movie; like Nakata's ""Ring"" series, ""Dark Water"" concentrates on a single mother and her weird kid in a threatening environment as several subplots - what's with all the scenes at the elementary school? - are designed to go nowhere, and indeed don't. That doesn't make them any more satisfactory.Walter Salles deserves credit for his artful direction - he darkens the edges of the frame and employs long shots to heighten Dahlia's isolation and dawning madness -  and discredit for forgetting to make a dramatic film that fails most of all at its blink-and-it's-over climax. As for Connelly - she's already traveled this territory in ""House of Sand and Fog"" and ""Requiem for a Dream."" Yes, she falls apart as well as any actress. But again? Roth and Reilly are paying their electric bills, and the kid acts like an alien.""Dark Water"" is one visually sumptuous, meditative, trembling blah, blah, blah of a thing. Horror?

It is an ambivalent level, since the special features specifically state that  there are ""two explanations"" for  all the things that happen, i.e.  one psychological, one supernatural. However, this seems to be more of a producers pretensions of grandeur, than a real explanation.It is a film that indulges in more of a character  driven  exposition of the story, so that in that respect, you  have to work more at enjoying the film. It's  definitely not an FX  driven film, but as the special  features  show, there are ""FX"" done so that the sound stage in Canada can be integrated with the Roosevelt island  background. The sound is totally awesome , in that with a 5.1  system, and the sound turned up, you can experience what is a very edgy film in this unrated version.Play times for the film vary, some say  103, some, like  AMAZON, say 105, and overall this is not clear, but the extra few, or the different few minutes done in this  edit pay off immensely in a very watchable, listenable, and experiential  film.The extras are very enjoyable; they add to the experience of the film, and show in detail, the elements of the almost indie film. The power is really in the casting for the  script, and whilst the editing could have flowed a little  better, the sound covers much of the fragmented editing. And the sound is clearly an additional character/feature to the film ( as is the water, to say the least). The deleted scenes are not many, but at least one scene  should have stayed in ... worth seeing this part to see if the scenes should have stayed the same or not.

Kyle doesn't care for Dahlia's decision but is unable to stop her from moving into a horrid and weirdly disturbing rent-controlled apartment complex, sprawling and psychologically dark.John C. Reilly plays landlord Mr. Murray, an overzealous and officious man who prefers to avoid problems with the large complex once pushing the hard sell to its tenants.  He repeatedly passes off Dahlia's problems to the building's super, Mr. Veeck (played by Pete Postlehwaite), a cantankerous old man without an ounce of friendliness and more than a little odd.In Dahlia's tiny, dilapidated apartment, in spite of recent paint and both Veeck and Murray's promise of considerable work done, the ceiling in the bedroom begins leaking dark and murky water.  Veeck blames it on two juvenile delinquents who break into the empty apartment above and vandalize it.  Then Ceci's new teacher (played by Camryn Manheim) informs Dahlia that Ceci has an 'imaginary friend' and is becoming antisocial within the classroom.Ceci's behavior inside the darkly unsettling complex becomes more and more bizarre, leading Dahlia to discover an unlocked door to a roof without a railing and a rusted water tower menacing the filthy rooftop.  Dahlia starts to wonder why she is having dark dreams, dreams of her own childhood, and why Ceci is infatuated with 'Nastasha', the girl who lives upstairs.But the apartment upstairs is empty and flooded with gruesomely fetid water, the same water leaking into Dahlia's apartment, so Dahlia forces Veeck to tell her the truth about the absent family from above.'Dark Water' is a very good psychological thriller.  The performances of Jennifer Connolly and Dougray Scott (two of my favorites), along with Pete Postlethwaite, Camryn Manheim, and John C. Reilly are exceptional, their talents bringing justice to the dilapidated and unforgiving eeriness of the apartment complex.The nastiness of the unclean water is presented so expertly that I could actually smell its foulness.  Dahlia's slide into depression and anxiety is very well portrayed as she questions her own sanity in the mess that has enveloped her and Ceci's lives.  The overall creepiness of this movie definitely deserves five stars, along with the photography, script, editing, and director Walter Salles.'Dark Water' is not the fast paced gore-fest us horror aficionado's enjoy, but the stealthy and creeping terror of unstable minds, decrepit architecture, a slow slide into madness, and the unworldly forces of the dead pushing their way into our lives.

The custody thing quickly goes nowhere. The little girl has imaginary friends. The dingy apartment in in tatters, leaks and all. There is an element of soaked dreariness about the whole affair.

The place, run by an eccentric manager (a scene-stealing John C. Reilly), and an even stranger superintendent (Pete Postlethwaite), isn't very welcoming, but Dahlia decides to give it her best shot. Mysterious occurrences start arriving with the appearance of a leaky ceiling in the apartment that drips black water. The water soon starts to appear everywhere to Dahlia, leading her to the brink of sanity. She tries to hold it together for Ceci, but the young girl is also dealing with the haunted surroundings, and the sinister nature of her new imaginary friend.Just glancing at ""Dark Water"" you can feel a wince coming on. The latest entry in the Japanese horror remake fiesta, ""Water"" comes to American shores with an ace up its sleeve: filmmaker Walter Salles. Directly off his international sensation, ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" the Brazilian director comes to this remake of the 2002 horror hit with some bright ideas on mood and suspense. After watching ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" (along with some other knock-offs) go horribly wrong, it's a small treat to see ""Dark Water"" translate so well to these shores.We've seen it before: ghost kids, spooky corners, imposing faucets. ""Dark Water"" doesn't feature too many firsts in its plot. Salles steps up to this challenge by forcing the material to bend to his will, creating a sensational mood of emotional destruction, baked with a crust of paranoia. ""Water"" isn't necessarily a ""boo!"" experience like the marketing suggests; Salles is much more interested in detailing the emotional seam bursting that is consuming Dahlia, and her decent into madness and guilt. No actress in the world is better suited for this gloomy journey than Jennifer Connelly, who is pitch-perfect in her role here. Salles smothers the film in darkness and moisture, weaving a mysterious, suspenseful vibe. Connelly is right there to back him up at every turn, providing a strong human core to the fantastical surroundings, and brilliantly matching the dark tone Salles is methodically arranging.""Water"" eventually succumbs to the obvious when ghost children start running around and the scare factor is turned up. Salles himself doesn't appear too interested in giving his audience the willies, but he does score an awesome climax, which is both unexpected and astonishing, considering this project comes from Disney. I can forgive some rather inane leaps at spooks when the ending is this good.Salles is even able to make his film compelling after original director Hideo Nakata stole most of the ideas for his ""Ring Two"" sequel from earlier this year.

The supporting cast is perfect and believable.  The direction is clever and well-paced, but not heavy-handed for this genre.  The scriptwriters created terrific characters and believable plot twists in this very suspenseful and eerie film.This is another well-adapted and even improved version of the original Japanese horror flick, but it isn't in the same vein asThe Grudgealthough it is influenced by it.  It is much more subdued and darker than that film and is more character driven.  Some may not like this slower, more deliberately paced chiller, but that is what gives it momentum and suspense.  I think it's very well-paced for the genre it falls into which is the traditional haunted house kind of film.This film is worth owning, but not having seen the film in the theaters, I have no clue what was added to this ""unrated"" edition of the original PG-13 theatrical release.  I can say that I found nothing objectionable in it as sometimes happens with these ""unrated"" releases.

933957,A2M8CILGD2NNPI,B000AWYOGE,"Steven Yates ""free your mind""","[6, 8]","This film, which cross-pollinates the psychological suspense thriller with the traditional ghost story, is not so much scary as disturbing. The plot, in brief:  Dahlia Williams (Jennifer Connelly) has separated from her husband. The two of them are involved in a tense custody battle for their daughter, five-year-old Ceci (Ariel Gade).  Forced to cut expenses to the bone, Dahlia finds a tawdry ninth floor apartment in a rent-controlled, dilapidated building on gloomy Roosevelt Island just off Manhattan. Strange events begin to occur, involving a mysterious backpack Ceci finds on the roof, whispers at night, noises from the abandoned apartment one floor above--and a leak in her front-room ceiling that keeps coming back. While Dahlia struggles to balance the demands of a new job with those of her estranged husband which now include the need to find an attorney, she has nightmares, battles migraines, and pleads with an apathetic landlord and his creepy maintenance man to fix her ceiling before it caves in. Her daughter, meanwhile, has found an ""imaginary playmate"" named Natasha--a name the girl couldn't possibly have invented and who, gradually, takes on a frightening reality as walls of ""dark water"" steadily close in on the two of them.Director Walter Salles and his team did a superb job increasing the believability of this story's supernatural elements by easing us first into a gritty background of New York realism. Doubtless many of us have dealt with landlords who were backslappers, assuring us this would be done and that would be taken care of, and then lose interest once your name is on the dotted line (and we don't even live in New York!). And there are plenty of employees more interested in their pensions or adhering to union policy than getting a job done. Or they ""don't want to get involved."" Nothing in Dahlia's new building works right. The elevators also leak; they malfunction; the washing machines don't work. These expected features of dilapidated buildings provide a seamless transition to the story's supernatural elements.  Another atmospheric soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks, Arlington Road) quietly enhances the all-pervasive sense of claustrophobia.The effects are superb from start to finish.  Water permeates everything.  Dripping water, puddling water, brackish standing water, dirty water spurting from nasty-rusty faucets and out of sinks, not to mention pouring down the walls in one of Dahlia's nightmares. Add to this the constant rain in scene after scene. Because there is so much variety, the use of water never seems overdone, and is balanced by plenty of other effective techniques. Among the best of these is the distinctly uncomfortable metallic whine and heart-like thumping that accompanies Dahlia's migraines--very suggestive of what the character is going through. The camera work is quite good as well. I don't believe I've seen a ceiling leak's POV before.The acting, finally, is brilliant.  Jennifer Connelly is at her best in a difficult role--and has anyone noticed how young Ariel Gade (perhaps better known to some viewers as Rose, from last year's TV series Invasion) is turning into one of the finest child actresses around? Her performance here exhibits a level of professionalism far in advance of her years (she was born in 1997!). The dynamic between her and Connelly is nearly perfect!  Their lines never seem clever or overly melodramatic, but pack just the right emotional punch--you can actually feel Dahlia's rising alarm when, courtesy of her ""imaginary playmate,"" Ceci knows things she can't possibly know--especially Dahlia's having been abused and rejected by her alcoholic mother. That scene sent chills down my spine. The supporting roles--by John C. Reilly as Murray the backslapping resident manager, Pete Postlethwaite as the creepy Veeck, Tim Roth as Dahlia's lawyer, Dougray Scott as her estranged husband Kyle--and finally, Camryn Manheim (Boston Legal) as Ceci's schoolteacher, mostly do what their various scenes need them to do. The only thing I found bothersome was that Dahlia's lawyer clearly lied to her about getting back to his family in the movies--not advancing the plot and making us wonder for no reason, as it turned out, whether Dahlia can trust him.In sum: Dark Water is all shifting moods and claustrophobic ambience. There's no gore, and not that much action. To my mind this sort of character-driven narrative is much more unsettling than creatures shambling around in the dark or even maniacs bearing long knives. The creatures obviously aren't real, and (most of the time) neither are the maniacs in their hockey masks. What scares us is what the ghostly antagonist represents. The ""monster"" in this film is a little girl who was abandoned by her parents in a ghastly mistake. Children do get abandoned in the real world. Separations and divorces do happen--all the time. People do end up struggling to survive, often under horrid living conditions, compelled to deal with others' indifference. I don't recommend this for children, and only hesitatingly recommend it for parents of children undergoing difficult separations and divorces. You know who you are. I give it five stars, though. It is a well told, brilliantly-realized bit of storytelling, with an ending that supplies a real jolt (no spoilers!). Dark Water compelled me to take a walk afterwards, and that's usually the way I measure the success of a film like this. Fortunately it wasn't raining.",5,Prepare to take a long walk afterwards ...,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,5491,"['film', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'traditional', 'ghost', 'story',

933967,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000AWYOGE,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Hollywood version of 'Dark Water' tries to do something we all long for in great horror films, but seldom get in reality. That is, realistic character and realistic scare, and the film directed by Walter Salles almost succeeds in getting both of them.Probably you should not watch Salles' `Dark Water' as horror whatever your fefinition of horror might be. It does not show many deaths, and its mystery is almost non-existent. The story is not complicated. A mother and a daughter move into an apartment in Roosevelt Island, New York City, but in this small room a series of strange things start to happen, for example, a leak from the ceiling, or sound of someone walking, coming from the room above, where no one should be living.But the modernized ghost story has in its center the characters drawn by novelist/screenwriter Rafael Yglesias (`Fearless'), whose interest does not seem to lie in telling a traditional horror story. Instead, Jennifer Connelly plays the loving mother Dahlia, who is in the middle of custody battle over the daughter Cecillia. Not being able to afford an expensive place, she rents an old apartment room to live with her lovely daughter, but what she is really afraid of is not the dark corridor or dirty basement of the building, but that one day she might lose her daughter. In that case the smooth-talking landlord (John C. Reilly) or grim old super (Pete Postlethwaite) do not help. Or, perhaps, Tim Roth's lawyer who uses his car as office.You see, `Dark Water' is a curious mixture of classic-type horror and classic-type drama. If Dahlia is driven to nervous breakdown, it might be because of the acrimonious fight against husband (Dougray Scott), or because of her own fear that her daughter might be going away from her, or maybe Dahlia's own past that is suggested in the opening. The emotion of some scenes is, some say, more suitable for much more `serious' dramas.Though they are fairly interesting, these aspects of the script about divorce court only weaken the supernatural part of the film, for which it was originally made. We surely see the dropping water from the ceiling, and the black stain that grows bigger and bigger everyday, but that only makes us think that they need a good plumber and less irresponsible super. Yes, the production designs of the building are superb, always creepy enough, but when we are greatly impressed with these spooky images, we forget anything about the not-so-rare story about the husband who left, or the custody fight.It was only three years ago that I watched the original 'Dark Water' (or 'Honogurai Mizuno Soko Kara') in Kyoto's old Toho-theatre, and as far as I can remember, the film didn't show much about the mother's past because it does not have to. Well-crafted as it is, this original film was not a big hit in Japan in spite of its director Hideo Nakata and the original writer Koji Suzuki, the same team who gave us the chilling 'Ringu.' I still don't know why it failed to attract many people, but whatever it is, Hollywood decided on adding materials to the Japanese version. It is laudable that they gave it an intelligent, psychological elements, but if you want a horror to be really scary, and supernatural story more fascinating, intelligence and psychology (and lawyer and custody) may not be necessarily the best choice to do so.",3,"They Live on This Floor, Mother, Daughter, and ... : Supernatural Horror with Less Scare and More Intelligence",1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,3339,"['Hollywood', 'version', ""'Dark"", 'Water', 'tries', 'do', 'something', 'long', 'great', 'horror', 'films', 'seldom', 'get', 'reality', 'realistic', 'character', 'realistic', 'scare', 'film', 'directed', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'almost', 'getting', 'them.Probably', 'should', 'not', 'watch', 'Salles', 'Dark', 'Water', 'horror', 'fefinition', 'horror', 'might', 'be', 'not', 'show', 'many', 'deaths', 'mystery', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'story', 'not', 'complicated', 'mother', 'daughter', 'move', 'apartment', 'Roosevelt', 'Island', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'small', 'room', 'series', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'example', 'leak', 'ceiling', 'sound', 'someone', 'walking', 'coming', 'room', 'where', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'living.But', 'modernized', 'ghost', 'story', 'center', 'characters', 'drawn', 'novelist/screenwriter', 'Rafael', 'Yglesias', 'Fearless', 'interest', 'not', 'seem', 'lie', 'telling', 'traditional', 'horror', 'story', 'Instead', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'loving', 'mother', 'Dahlia', 'who', 'middle', 'custody', 'battle', 'daughter', 'Cecillia', 'Not', 'being', 'able', 'afford', 'expensive', 'place', 'old', 'apartment', 'room', 'live', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'what', 'really', 'afraid', 'not', 'dark', 'corridor', 'dirty', 'basement', 'building', 'one', 'day', 'might', 'lose', 'daughter', 'case', 'smooth-talking', 'landlord', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'grim', 'old', 'super', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'do', 'not', 'help', 'perhaps', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'lawyer', 'who', 'car', 'office.You', 'see', 'Dark', 'Water', 'curious', 'mixture', 'classic-type', 'horror', 'classic-type', 'drama', 'Dahlia', 'driven', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'might', 'be', 'acrimonious', 'fight', 'husband', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'own', 'fear', 'daughter', 'might', 'be', 'going', 'away', 'maybe', 'Dahlia', 'own', 'past', 'suggested', 'opening', 'emotion', 'scenes', 'say', 'more', 'suitable', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'are', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'script', 'divorce', 'court', 'only', 'weaken', 'supernatural', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'surely', 'see', 'dropping', 'water', 'ceiling', 'black', 'stain', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'everyday', 'only', 'think', 'need', 'good', 'plumber', 'less', 'irresponsible', 'super', 'Yes', 'production', 'designs', 'building', 'are', 'superb', 'always', 'creepy', 'enough', 'when', 'are', 'greatly', 'impressed', 'spooky', 'images', 'forget', 'anything', 'not-so-rare', 'story', 'husband', 'who', 'left', 'custody', 'fight.It', 'was', 'only', 'three', 'years', 'watched', 'original', ""'Dark"", 'Water', ""'Honogurai"", 'Mizuno', 'Soko', 'Kara', 'Kyoto', 'old', 'Toho-theatre', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'remember', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'much', 'mother', 'past', 'not', 'have', 'Well-crafted', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'hit', 'Japan', 'spite', 'director', 'Hideo', 'Nakata', 'original', 'writer', 'Koji', 'Suzuki', 'same', 'team', 'who', 'gave', 'chilling', ""'Ringu"", 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'failed', 'attract', 'many', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'decided', 'adding', 'materials', 'Japanese', 'version', 'laudable', 'gave', 'intelligent', 'psychological', 'elements', 'want', 'horror', 'be', 'really', 'scary', 'supernatural', 'story', 'more', 'fascinating', 'intelligence', 'psychology', 'lawyer', 'custody', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'necessarily', 'best', 'choice', 'do', 'so']",N/A

The atmosphere is great, dark, wet, creepy, and old, u can almost smell the dank air and mill dew in the apartment complex of the film. Dark Water mainly revolves around the complex where Jennifer C moves with her estranged daughter, who really doesnt have any issues until after they move in. The leak in the ceiling, the creepy upstairs apartment thats flooded with dirty brown water, but full or furniture, these all play a big part in the whole premise of the film. I won't say much else but the front desk gentleman might not be quite who u think he is, and James C. Reily as the landlord is just classic here. Very realistic.

Jennifer Connelly [A Beautiful Mind] makes a beautiful if tragic character, playing the role of a recently divorced woman, Dahlia who leases an apartment in a dingy complex on New York's Roosevelt Island. She is in the midst of a heated custody battle over her five-year-old daughter, Cecilia and things only get worse when she finds the new apartment is anything but perfect. Now, having watched Ms Connelly in House of Sand of Fog, she does a similarly admirable job of portraying an emotionally conflicted character here too. There are some good supporting roles here, e.g. Tim Roth as Dahlia's attorney, and also John C Reilly as the loathsome apartment manager. On the whole, this movie would have been a much better horror story as it purports to be if it had focussed more on explaining the supernatural occurences in the movie than on merely dwelling on the tormented character of Dahlia.
