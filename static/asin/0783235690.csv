66476,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0783235690,Acute Observer,"[3, 18]","Marnie, 1964 filmThe story begins with a woman walking along railroad tracks. We learn there was a robbery of a safe, $9,967 is missing, the office manager gives her description. ""No references at all."" [Subtle humor here.] ""She seemed so nice."" We see the woman loading her suitcases, the placing one in a station. Mary Edgar now checks into a hotel where she is known. Then she returns to her mother. Money is for spending. Her mother doesn't like men. She plans to take in roomers. There is personal conflict between mother and daughter. [Does her mother seem too young?] Marnie has a bad dream. Later she applies for a new job. Do looks count? She is a young widow who wants responsibility. Mrs. Taylor gets the job. We see an office from the early 1960s. An ink blot on her sleeve? She can work on Saturdays. Mr. Rutland studied zoology. Female animals are often predators.A storm scares Mrs. Taylor. Is she also frightened of some colors? A tree limb breaks a window. They visit the Atlantic City racetrack. Some man watches her. Did he recognize her? They talk about their past. She meets the Rutland family. Back at work she stays after quitting time, then opens that desk drawer to learn the combination to the safe. The cleaning lady mops the floors. Mark Rutland knows who she is! She tells her story. [The monetary figures date this picture.] Rutland questions her about her past. They stop at a diner to talk. ""I can't let you go."" Mark tells Marnie what he wants to do. [Is this credible?] ""If you love me let me go."" ""I caught you."" Six and a half carats for $42,000? Is he crazy too? ""There's nothing charming about squandering money."" Someone snoops in Marnie's desk and learns about Strutts. Mark gets an unpleasant surprise on their honeymoon. ""Let me alone."" Marnie says ""nothing happened"". Or does she need all the help she can get? ""You won't?"" ""I won't.""Reading about marine life? ""I'm sorry, Marnie."" Will Mark be able to defrost Marnie? The next morning she is gone. Afloat in the pool! They cut short their honeymoon to return home. Someone overhears their conversation. Marnie loves the black horse Mark bought. His sister-in-law Lil learns about asks about Marnie's mother in Baltimore. Is it just a gag? Mark learns more about the girl from his private detective. Why did Marnie have a nightmare? She describes her dream. Who makes those taps? Why is she cold? Will she read about her ""undiscovered self""? Why does she react to a color? ""Help me!"" There is a party, a lot of guests arrive. There is a surprise guest. They discuss their options for solving Marnie's problems.The next day they ride to a fox hunt. The hounds catch the fox. Marnie returns alone, there is an accident taking a stone wall! Marnie grabs a pistol to end the horse's suffering. What will she do next? ""I'll take you home to your mother."" There is conflict by the safe. Back home Mark asks Mrs. Edgar to tell the truth. He has learned the truth about her family. ""What happens next?"" She relives the past. ""I hit him with the stick."" [Isn't this unintentionally funny?] Is the evil spell broken by this event? Berenice tells what happened decades earlier. This ""talking cure"" seems to work in this movie. ""What am I going to do?"" Mark promises a happy ending.Was this Hitchcock's worst movie? The actors only follow their direction. A ""message movie"" is usually a flop because the audience does not buy the message. This ""talking cure"" does not always work. [It seems like Pavlovian conditioning in associating one event with another.] Note the similarities to ""Psycho"". The fairy tale ""Sleeping Beauty"" features a cure when the Prince's kisses removed the curse that made her sick. Can this really happen in real life? Its not believable.

It has been documented that Hitch had his &quot;problems&quot; in the area of confronting fear and sex and this film is his release of it. Hedren in her last film for Hitch had alot to carry on her shoulders at the time. She was fighting off Hitchcock's alleged advances towards her and her image as a Grace Kelly wannabe. I think Hedren never tried to be kelly, she stood out in her own way; her coldness and icy beauty out weighs Kelly's ten fold! Hitch new this and used it to his advantage in the film. Connery does a great job in this film as being a pseudo husband who falls for her coldness. After all men love the chase and Connery, is in all out toupe glory. Love this film to death and now for the reason to buy it! This film to some extent is the telling of everyone's private sexual thoughts.

66483,AB8J1LJTCJ8LI,0783235690,Amazon Customer,"[1, 3]","According to Hitchcock, the MacGuffin, in it's purest form, is a complete throw away item to the movie.  My two favorite MacGuffins are the money Marion steals in PSYCHO, which Hitchcock literally throws away; and the reason the birds are attacking in THE BIRDS, which Hitch never explains.  The problem with his psychological pictures, like MARNIE and SPELLBOUND, is that there can't be a MacGuffin.  I suppose you could say Marnie's childhood experience could be the MacGuffin, but you need that.  You need to know why Marnie acts like she does to accept her actions as that of a sick person who needs help.  So, as the Master loved to say in his story, ""then that's no MacGuffin!""Not that this is a bad movie.  Not at all.  I put it in the category of ""interesting premise, but . . .""  As in, interesting premise, but the scenery looked very silly.  Was he trying to make it seem like the characters were in a painting?  He could learn something from Selznick's PORTRAIT OF JENNIE.Interesting premise, but, Tippi Hedren?  This was probably the best performance of her career, but that doesn't mean it was perfect.  She played the cold, man-hating thief well, but it fell apart in the big ""revelation"" scene.  Giving her some credit, I imagine that weird scene would be difficult for even the best actress.Interesting premise, and how about that Sean Connery?  Truly the gem of the movie, this early performance would prove why he would have such longevity as an actor.  He gives his character complexity and realism.  He delivers every line perfectly and honestly.  He could easily rival Jimmy Stewart's performance in VERTIGO, had he been given better material to work with.  All that, and he's not too bad on the eyes.  No, really!Interesting premise, but see Hitchcock's classics first.

Early on in the casting process, it was rumored Grace Kelly would make her long awaited return to movies by playing the title chracter. But, it never happened. Instead, the role went to ""Tippi"" Hedren, who starred in ""The Birds"" as well. The result was possibly the most underrated of Hitchcock's movie.Marnie (Hedren) is a complusive theif. She can't control herself. She takes what she likes as she pleases without ever thinking twice. In an attempt to cure herself, she goes to work for the wealthy Mark Rutland (Sean Connery in one of his best roles ever), but she winds up trying to steal from him as well. Rather than firing her and calling the police, Rutland falls in love with her, almost as compulsively as she steals from him. The two marry, but that does not solve Marnie's problem. Mark is now determined to get to the bottom of this, leading to a harrowing conclusion in which Marnie is finally able to confront her demons for good.As I said, ""Marnie"" is a severely underrated movie. ""Tippi"" Hedren gives the best performance of her (relatively short) career, even better than her star making role in ""The Birds"". And Sean Connery gives one of his top five greatest performances as Mark. Forget ""The Untouchables"" (thought that is an awesome movie).

He's awfully good with these mysteries that have as much to do with the mind as the evidence or facts in any material sense. This is one such.Tippi Hedren plays Marnie, a compulsive liar and thief. Sean Connery plays Mark Rutland who has the ""misfortune"" to fall in love with her. It's pitiful how little I can tell you about the story without spoiling it. Let's try.Bruce Dern plays the drunken sailor.No, wait, that's not what I wanted to say. Hitchcock's cameo is right at the beginning, when he's coming out of a hotel room into the hallway where Marnie is just checking in.Rutland hires Marnie even though (because?) he recognizes her as the girl who disappeared at the same time as his attorney's cash from his safe. She didn't recognize him. She had been a brunette then, but in that hotel where we saw Hitchcock, she washed the dye out of her hair and it became dark gold. I suppose her application for the bookkeeper job at Rutland Publications was just coincidence, but everything after that ties together in a very tight and well knotted plot.Poor Marnie has some serious emotional problems, most particularly that she can't stand to have men touch her -- even Sean Connery!!! (That's how we know she is really, really crazy.) But he's clever, patient and rather devious, and he eventually gets to the bottom of the problem.For you to get to the bottom, you will have to watch the film.

The sets are painfully fake--talk about old Hollywood, and Marnie's ending is mellowdramatic to a fault, almost comically so. Digging up repressed memories and having catharsis is old as the hills, and any therapist or person in therapy will tell you the quickness with which it happens here is ridiculous, even by 1964 standards.Yet Marinie is artictically redeemed in many ways. The opening titles are done over Bernard Herman's jarring string music. Suddenly, the music stops, and Hitchcock cuts to a close up of Marnie's yellow pocketbook, then goes wide for a long shot of the railroad station she walks in. Hitchcock employs red color filters through the movie: you can tell from these moves he was expermenting, succssfully, with techniques young Europian modernists like Godard were then using. These  add suprise to the film, and if the storytelling needs work, the adventurousness of Hitchcock here makes the film worth several viewings.After the 1-2 horror punch of Psycho and The Byrds, the psychosexual bent of Marnie asks the viewer to make an incredable adjustment, particualarly when the execution is so soap operaesqe and painfully dated.

Although disdained by some even today, MARNIE has attracted a steady and ever-growing stream of admirers, and it appears that this film has finally attained the legendary status it deserves.  Undoubtedly Hitchcock's last great film, MARNIE is usually interpreted as a psychological thriller, but I believe it to be essentially a love story, and Hitchcock's most personal and mature examination of the human need for love and the masks we wear which prevent us from truly loving others.  The relationship between Marnie Edgar and her husband/blackmailer Mark Rutland is the heart and soul of the film, and is certainly one of the most compelling and believable relationships in screen history.  Marnie (Tippi Hedren) is a quick-change artist and a thief, who uses her aristocratic looks and sensual presence to hoodwink her bosses, from whom she steals large amounts of money.  Marnie's life is essentially empty and aimless.  Her well-groomed facade masks a lonely interior.  Marnie cannot love, because she has no clear idea of who she is, and her crimes prevent anyone from getting close to her.  Attracted by her beauty, Mark Rutland hires her to work in his company.  At first, Mark appears to be interested in her merely as a sexual plaything, but several scenes detail the course of their relationship and make it clear that he is truly falling in love with her and desires nothing more than to find out who she really is.  Frightened by his attention (and by her response to him - itis also clear that Marnie is attracted), Marnie reverts to her criminal identity, and walks off with the contents of the Rutland safe.  Against all expectations, Mark not only fails to turn her over to the police, he actually makes himself complicit in her crime by covering up for her.  With this as leverage, he blackmails her into marrying him so he can learn her secrets.  Soon discovering that Marnie is sexually frigid, Mark comes to believe that she is in fact mentally disturbed, and he uncovers her background with the goal of helping her grow as a human being. The film is genuinely touching and suspenseful, and the costumes and sets are brilliant - almost expressionistic.  Hedren and Connery make a great couple and turn in two fantastic performances.  If you want to see a movie about relationships rather than explosions (which still manages to be suspenseful and exciting in the best Hitchcock tradition) see this.

Mind you, I'm not saying Marnie isn't a worthwhile film, just that its 1960s 'repressed childhood memory screws up an adult life' theme can be a bit much to take at times. Tippi Hedren looks great (as usual) as she plays a bunco lady in this film, lifting cash from a succession of employers when she is not flipping out having seen something red in color. Sean Connery has the misfortune of falling in love with her (for no apparent reason other than her Tippi Hedren looks apparently) and thus sets out to try to help her in any manner he can. She pleads with him in the film ""If you love me, let me go,"" but Sean will have none of that & doggedly persists in his mission (spurred on by what who knows). I know it was typical of that era of film making, having rather fake looking scenes set in cars that are supposed to be traveling on roads, but this film has over 7 full minutes of this as Marnie and Connery's character make believe they are in transit to someplace---7 minutes is a lot of seconds in a film, even when broken up by other scenes. Moreover, Hitchcock utilizes several very fake looking matte paintings as backdrops in this film. Maybe it's just me, but all this just reinforced my feeling that the story was a bit forced as well.

But yesterday (2013Jan19), I finally watched ""Marnie.""I previously screened ""The Girl"" with Toby Jones, where he puts out another tour-de-force performance.  I had previously seen him in (at least) ""Infamous,"" where he was fantastic, even more so than Philip Seymour Hoffman in ""Capote.""  Well, once again, Mr. Jones nails another performance as Hitchcock!  Can this guy do no wrong?  At this point I think ""no,"" but I suppose I'll have to queue up more of Mr. Jone's films to verify.  But at any rate, while watching ""The Girl"" -- which I highly recommend -- there was reference to the film ""Marnie,"" where they reproduced some of the scenes being shot.  Since I hadn't seen ""Marnie"" I now had to watch.Suffice it to say, I was somewhat disappointed.  Sure, Tippi Hedren puts out a fine performance, even though she only had one film under her belt at this point and she was ""just"" a model before that.  And Sean Connery gives it his usual go, and he is really good as well.  But even though the digital transfer on this movie was fantastic on my new Roku box, I still had several issues with this film.1.  It just hasn't aged very well.  There are quite a few scenes that are supposed to be scary; maybe they were back in the day.  But nowadays, some of the plot elements here -- I won't give too many away -- are tamer than anything that you'd see today on ""The Jerry Springer Show.""  So, I wasn't really scared.2.  I was laughing way more than covering my eyes.  Actually, I was howling.  Now that is not a very good sign when watching a movie that should be in at least the suspense genre.  At least I wasn't in a theater, as people surely would have been mad at my laughter.3.  I didn't completely buy Mr. Connery's motivations here.

The problem Hitch had with his films released after &quot;Psycho&quot; is that everyone now measured the new film against &quot;Psycho.&quot;  I don't even think &quot;Psycho&quot; is his best film much less that all of his later films should be compared to it! If &quot;Psycho&quot; was his scariest film, then &quot;Marnie&quot; was his most romantic.  Probably no one disliked Sean Connery as James Bond more than I did.  He was too slick, too suave, too oiled down for me in that persona.  This was the first time I'd seen him play another role and I was amazed at how attractive he was in comparison. The essential of the story line is that Marnie (Hedren) is a career criminal in various physical disguises, who steals huge sums from her wealthy bosses who are besotted by her. She makes a huge mistake in picking Mark Rutland (Connery) as her next mark because he recongizes her from a prior job since he was a client of that employer's. He also has a problem though: he starts falling in love with Marnie.  There is a reason Marnie is the way she is though and Rutland starts getting closer and closer to finding out what happened to her as a child back in Baltimore.  Connery makes a terrific romantic hero playing Rutland and it is hard for me to believe that most women, at the very least, wouldn't be very taken with this film.

Our titular character in this film has a real hang up with that color, to the point where she goes into a panic attack every time she sees it. That is the jumping off point of ""Marnie,"" a lackluster Hitchcock film starring Sean Connery and Tippi Hedren. It plays like a greatest hits of Hitchcock themes: Mistaken identities, obsessive behavior, perfect crimes. The problem is that his scope is so big and his ideas so many that this film lacks the focus and intensity that he is known for. By the time the end rolls around the plot has nosedived into mumbo jumbo, and that's not to mention the climax which is downright implausible. Hitchcock had made many gems before this one so my only conclusion can be that this time around he let his ego do the directing.The film starts out following Marnie around as she robs her places of employment. Her scheme is similar to the one used in ""Bad Santa"" only she pretends to be a good worker so as not to arouse suspicion (overtime not fornicating in the big and tall section). All men have weak spots and she knows how to exploit them and turn them into jobs (even though she has no references). She eventually runs into Mark (Connery nailing the sexy suave look) who busts her and then blackmails her into marriage. Of course had the criminal looked like Homer Simpson and not Tippi Hedren we would have had a different movie on our hands. The dilemma for Mark is the aforementioned repressed passion. So she refuses to put out and he (being a Hitchcockian leading male) becomes obsessed with making her do the deed. Hitchcock wanted to compare the taming of Marnie to the taming of a wild animal. This is fine because he does it in a very clever, populist way. Who wouldn't want a wife who was as beautiful as Marnie, who was also well behaved? And since Mark wanted what every man wants (secretly or openly) then we have to root for him to tame her. At this point, however, the plot becomes unhinged. We watch as Hitchcock strains for the Grand Ole Climax. His score abandons all subtlety. His landscapes are huge. His camera swoops and dives. It's a spectacle to watch, but it is not strong filmmaking.It comes as no surprise that Marnie had a sordid sexual childhood and that is the reason for her dysfunction. But remember this was in a time before every indiscretion was excused away with that explanation. The fact that she gets away free and clear shows that this film was a great inspiration for our generation of entertainers and politicians. As far as Hitchcock goes, you can't win them all. By reworking the ending and eliminating about 20 minutes he could have pumped enough energy into the film to make it work. But as it is we are left with a final sequence that goes for shock (!) and comes up with silliness and overacting. **1/2",2,Hitchcock Does Freud,1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,2878,"['Back', 'before', 'red', 'represented', 'commies', 'backwards', 'voting', 'habits', 'represented', 'passion', 'titular', 'character', 'film', 'real', 'hang', 'up', 'color', 'point', 'where', 'panic', 'attack', 'time', 'jumping', 'off', 'point', 'Marnie', 'lackluster', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'starring', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'greatest', 'hits', 'Hitchcock', 'themes', 'Mistaken', 'identities', 'obsessive', 'behavior', 'perfect', 'crimes', 'problem', 'scope', 'so', 'big', 'ideas', 'so', 'many', 'film', 'focus', 'intensity', 'known', 'time', 'end', 'plot', 'nosedived', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'not', 'mention', 'climax', 'downright', 'implausible', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'made', 'many', 'gems', 'one', 'so', 'only', 'conclusion', 'can', 'be', 'time', 'let', 'ego', 'do', 'directing.The', 'film', 'out', 'following', 'Marnie', 'places', 'employment', 'scheme', 'similar', 'one', 'used', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'only', 'be', 'good', 'worker', 'so', 'not', 'arouse', 'suspicion', 'not', 'fornicating', 'big', 'tall', 'section', 'men', 'have', 'weak', 'spots', 'how', 'exploit', 'turn', 'jobs', 'even', 'references', 'eventually', 'Mark', 'Connery', 'nailing', 'sexy', 'suave', 'look', 'who', 'then', 'blackmails', 'marriage', 'course', 'had', 'criminal', 'looked', 'Homer', 'Simpson', 'not', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'different', 'movie', 'hands', 'dilemma', 'Mark', 'aforementioned', 'repressed', 'passion', 'put', 'out', 'being', 'Hitchcockian', 'leading', 'male', 'obsessed', 'making', 'do', 'deed', 'Hitchcock', 'wanted', 'compare', 'taming', 'Marnie', 'taming', 'wild', 'animal', 'fine', 'very', 'clever', 'populist', 'way', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'as', 'beautiful', 'Marnie', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'behaved', 'Mark', 'wanted', 'what', 'man', 'secretly', 'openly', 'then', 'have', 'root', 'tame', 'point', 'however', 'plot', 'unhinged', 'watch', 'Hitchcock', 'strains', 'Grand', 'Ole', 'Climax', 'score', 'abandons', 'subtlety', 'landscapes', 'are', 'huge', 'camera', 'swoops', 'dives', 'spectacle', 'watch', 'not', 'strong', 'filmmaking.It', 'surprise', 'Marnie', 'had', 'sordid', 'sexual', 'childhood', 'reason', 'dysfunction', 'remember', 'was', 'time', 'indiscretion', 'was', 'excused', 'away', 'explanation', 'fact', 'away', 'free', 'clear', 'shows', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'inspiration', 'generation', 'entertainers', 'politicians', 'As', 'far', 'Hitchcock', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'reworking', 'ending', 'eliminating', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'pumped', 'enough', 'energy', 'film', 'make', 'work', 'are', 'left', 'final', 'sequence', 'shock', 'up', 'silliness', 'overacting', '**1/2']",N/A

66503,A26ZZAVN3C96P0,0783235690,Cookie Crawford,"[4, 5]","Jumping in to share my impressions of MARNIE, I initially wondered if I was qualified, as I haven't seen the film for several years. And yet, maybe a movie should only be judged by the impact it had on a viewer in that first, 120 minute experience. If multiple viewings are required to appreciate a film's ""greatness"", maybe it isn't really that great after all...Here's the scoop: the aging and temperamental filmmaker first had years of trouble adapting Winston Graham's tricky novel, going through a multitude of writers and one hoped-for leading player in the form of the retired Grace Kelly. (Aside from THE TURNING POINT, an early draft of which would have paired her with Audrey Hepburn in the 1970's, MARNIE is the only film that Kelly seriously considered accepting after marrying.) Hitchcock then gave up on investing himself in the actual filming of MARNIE after his eventual star rebuffed his sexual advances on the set. He wasn't going to do anything to further Tippi Hedren's career after that, including giving her a solid showcase.Like Hitchcock's other, post NORTH BY NORTHWEST films, MARNIE has a heavy air of artificiality. This feeling worked for me in PSYCHO because the jangly, disassociated quality underscored the descent into Norman Bates' skewed and diseased mind....but in MARNIE and THE BIRDS, it's hard for me to swallow that this is a story involving real people. Hence I, as a -- I'd hope -- real person feel detached and shut out. The world of the film simply feels strained and underpopulated.As the heroine, the slightly starchy Tippi Hedren is perfectly cast. (Note how she's credited as 'Tippi' Hedren in the credits, an annoying display of the director's perverse possessiveness.) But in the more vulnerable scenes -- breaking down in tears with her mother, for instance -- she lacks the fluid technique of say, an Ingrid Bergman, who could have made such naked moments work.Sean Connery is, I agree, the sexiest and most immediate of Hitchcock's leading men, who can tend toward having a passive persona -- Henry Fonda, James Stewart, Anthony Perkins, Cary Grant, et al.  Prurient viewers may want to carefully rewatch the scene where Connery gets up from a cafe table after drinking a cup of coffee with Marnie. (I believe this falls somewhere in the racetrack sequence?) It appears that the actor isn't wearing underwear!This film gets four stars from me because it is made by my favorite director, and even a flawed work of his is better than much of what is delivered by lesser filmmakers. And yet aside from the very affecting theme of emotional yearning that runs through the film, (involving Marnie, Mark and Lil), the element that has stayed with me most strongly is Bernard Herrmann's luscious and lovely score.If Hitchcock fans have not already read it, I think the finest analysis of this great director's work is found in Robin Wood's brilliant and meticulous HITCHCOCK'S FILMS, which was the second book in the ""International Film Guide Series"".",4,Compelling Mishmash,1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,2996,"['Jumping', 'share', 'impressions', 'MARNIE', 'initially', 'wondered', 'was', 'qualified', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'several', 'years', 'yet', 'maybe', 'movie', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'judged', 'impact', 'had', 'viewer', 'first', '120', 'minute', 'experience', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'are', 'required', 'appreciate', 'film', 'greatness', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'really', 'great', 'Here', 'scoop', 'aging', 'temperamental', 'filmmaker', 'first', 'had', 'years', 'trouble', 'adapting', 'Winston', 'Graham', 'tricky', 'novel', 'going', 'multitude', 'writers', 'one', 'hoped-for', 'leading', 'player', 'form', 'retired', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'THE', 'TURNING', 'POINT', 'early', 'draft', 'would', 'have', 'paired', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', '1970', 'MARNIE', 'only', 'film', 'Kelly', 'seriously', 'considered', 'accepting', 'marrying', 'Hitchcock', 'then', 'gave', 'up', 'investing', 'actual', 'filming', 'MARNIE', 'eventual', 'star', 'rebuffed', 'sexual', 'advances', 'set', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'do', 'anything', 'further', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'career', 'including', 'giving', 'solid', 'showcase.Like', 'Hitchcock', 'other', 'post', 'NORTH', 'BY', 'NORTHWEST', 'films', 'MARNIE', 'heavy', 'air', 'artificiality', 'feeling', 'worked', 'PSYCHO', 'jangly', 'disassociated', 'quality', 'underscored', 'descent', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'skewed', 'diseased', 'mind', '.but', 'MARNIE', 'THE', 'BIRDS', 'hard', 'swallow', 'story', 'involving', 'real', 'people', 'Hence', ""'d"", 'hope', 'real', 'person', 'feel', 'detached', 'shut', 'out', 'world', 'film', 'simply', 'feels', 'strained', 'heroine', 'slightly', 'starchy', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Note', 'how', 'credited', ""'Tippi"", 'Hedren', 'credits', 'annoying', 'display', 'director', 'perverse', 'possessiveness', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'scenes', 'breaking', 'down', 'tears', 'mother', 'instance', 'fluid', 'technique', 'say', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'such', 'naked', 'moments', 'work.Sean', 'Connery', 'agree', 'sexiest', 'most', 'immediate', 'Hitchcock', 'leading', 'men', 'who', 'can', 'tend', 'having', 'passive', 'persona', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'et', 'al', 'Prurient', 'viewers', 'may', 'want', 'carefully', 'rewatch', 'scene', 'where', 'Connery', 'up', 'cafe', 'table', 'drinking', 'cup', 'coffee', 'Marnie', 'believe', 'somewhere', 'racetrack', 'sequence', 'actor', ""n't"", 'wearing', 'underwear', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'made', 'favorite', 'director', 'even', 'flawed', 'work', 'better', 'much', 'what', 'delivered', 'lesser', 'filmmakers', 'yet', 'aside', 'very', 'affecting', 'theme', 'emotional', 'yearning', 'film', 'involving', 'Marnie', 'Mark', 'Lil', 'element', 'stayed', 'most', 'strongly', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'luscious', 'lovely', 'score.If', 'Hitchcock', 'fans', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'read', 'think', 'finest', 'analysis', 'great', 'director', 'work', 'found', 'Robin', 'Wood', 'brilliant', 'meticulous', 'HITCHCOCK', 'FILMS', 'was', 'second', 'book', 'International', 'Film', 'Guide', 'Series']",N/A
66504,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,0783235690,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 4]","After his back to back commercial and critical triumphs of Psycho and The Birds, Alfred Hitchcock decided to go `interior.' By that, I mean he decided to get unfortunately Freudian in his approach to crime, as he had throughout his career. Unfortunately, all but a few of his films suffer from their reliance on the outmoded and simplistic approaches to psychology that he employed. One of them was Marnie, his 1964 color follow up to the two terrific films mentioned at the start, starring his The Birds female lead, Tippi Hedren.While the film flopped at the box office, latter day critics have tried to overcompensate for this fact by declaring the film a masterpiece. It's not, but it is a good, solid film that is better than originally thought. Its first hour is a nearly flawless study of a female thief, Marnie Edgar (Hedren)- aka Margaret Edgar, Peggy Nicholson, and Mary Taylor, who is sort of what the Janet Leigh character in Psycho may have become had she not been killed so early in that film. Her development is evenly paced and believable, never forced nor rushed. Then, when Marnie is caught by her boss, a widower named Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), and blackmailed into marriage, the film goes downhill, as Marnie's freakouts over the color red, highlighted by Hitchcock's over the top usage of red fade-ins and interludes (compare them with Ingmar Bergman's similar later technique in Cries And Whispers), lead to even greater and sillier melodrama.... All in all, Marnie is a flawed, but worthwhile, entry in the Hitchcock canon, and better than some more highly regarded earlier films. That said, it's a transition film which led the way to Hitchcock's final film of merit, 1972's Frenzy, and embodies all the best of Hitchcock, as well as his worst. In that sense, one could argue it is the Master Of Suspense's most Hitchcockian film, even if it is not too heavy on the suspense. In a more real world sense, it is a film that could have been great, yet also shows why Hitchcock was a flawed artist; thus a film that should be studied by students of the craft; a not too bad way to fail, after all.",3,Solid,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,2120,"['back', 'back', 'commercial', 'critical', 'triumphs', 'Psycho', 'Birds', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'decided', 'go', 'interior', 'mean', 'decided', 'get', 'unfortunately', 'Freudian', 'approach', 'crime', 'had', 'career', 'Unfortunately', 'few', 'films', 'suffer', 'reliance', 'outmoded', 'simplistic', 'approaches', 'psychology', 'employed', 'One', 'was', 'Marnie', '1964', 'color', 'follow', 'up', 'two', 'terrific', 'films', 'mentioned', 'start', 'starring', 'Birds', 'female', 'lead', 'Tippi', 'Hedren.While', 'film', 'flopped', 'box', 'office', 'latter', 'day', 'critics', 'have', 'tried', 'overcompensate', 'fact', 'declaring', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'good', 'solid', 'film', 'better', 'originally', 'thought', 'first', 'hour', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'study', 'female', 'thief', 'Marnie', 'Edgar', 'Hedren', 'aka', 'Margaret', 'Edgar', 'Peggy', 'Nicholson', 'Mary', 'Taylor', 'who', 'sort', 'what', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'character', 'Psycho', 'may', 'have', 'become', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'killed', 'so', 'early', 'film', 'development', 'evenly', 'paced', 'believable', 'never', 'forced', 'rushed', 'Then', 'when', 'Marnie', 'caught', 'boss', 'widower', 'named', 'Mark', 'Rutland', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'blackmailed', 'marriage', 'film', 'downhill', 'Marnie', 'freakouts', 'color', 'red', 'highlighted', 'Hitchcock', 'top', 'usage', 'red', 'fade-ins', 'interludes', 'compare', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'similar', 'later', 'technique', 'Cries', 'Whispers', 'lead', 'even', 'greater', 'sillier', 'melodrama', 'Marnie', 'flawed', 'worthwhile', 'entry', 'Hitchcock', 'canon', 'better', 'more', 'highly', 'regarded', 'earlier', 'films', 'said', 'transition', 'film', 'led', 'way', 'Hitchcock', 'final', 'film', 'merit', '1972', 'Frenzy', 'best', 'Hitchcock', 'as', 'well', 'worst', 'sense', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'Master', 'Suspense', 'most', 'Hitchcockian', 'film', 'even', 'not', 'too', 'heavy', 'suspense', 'more', 'real', 'world', 'sense', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'yet', 'also', 'why', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'flawed', 'artist', 'thus', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'studied', 'students', 'craft', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'way', 'fail']",N/A
66505,A25CZCHLNH3OMO,0783235690,Cuckoo Pine Nut,"[7, 8]","It is time now to write a review for ''Marnie''. I've watched it six times this year already, twice in January and four times since I bought it about three weeks ago. When a movie is good enough to be watched so many times in succession, it's really a six-star film - but as this reviewing system allows only five, I'll rate it five. The trailer gets five stars of its own.I will confess that the first time through - much as I found the story interesting - this movie did seem to drag a bit. I kept thinking, half this film is Sean and Tippi sitting in the car - or so it seemed - but the second time, I enjoyed it much more and it didn't drag at all. I started to listen to all the good lines which made the ''endless car scenes'' go driving on by with all swiftness, and each subsequent viewing has been even better.Various observations: In the credits, it says: Miss Hedren's Hairstyles Designed by Alexandre of Paris, and right below that: Colour by Technicolour. I think that is pretty good. I liked the way that Lil, jealous of Mark's love for Marnie, often appears wearing green, sitting on green couches, or having green lamps behind her. I found Lil's character annoying, but it was a necessary annoyance, I suppose, and I've become relatively used to her by now. I also liked the idea conveyed by Marnie walking along a yellow caution line at a railway station in the beginning of the movie. Strutt is a weirdo and the actor was perfect for the part; I wonder what he looked like without the gross tortoiseshell glasses. There is a scene when Marnie paces back and forth in her room, passing the tall posts of her bed every time, as if she is an animal in a cage. The free association scene was good as well, with a couple good lines, one of the best being, ''You Freud, me Jane?'' Cousin Bob the banker dude was quite the perfect weirdo for the part, and Daddy Rutland was a pretty shallow but friendly personage with his one-track mind focused only on horsesandtea. Marnie had some pretty interesting outfits - two pretty Star-Trekky bathrobes as well as a hat like a fur doughnut. Marnie's mother was good with the Southern accent and the little girl Jessie was even more annoying than Lil.Oh, and before I forget. People are forever griping about the ''tacky rear projection'' in the riding scenes, the ''obviously fake backgrounds'' of the ship and of Rutlands', and the ''tacky zooming in and out'' in Marnie's final attempt at theft from the safe. Let me point out to you that several other Hitchcock films, regarded by the critics and general Hitchcock-appreciating public, have similar moments. In ''The Birds'', ''To Catch a Thief'', ''Spellbound'', and others, there was some very obvious back projection. Big deal. The general idea of rear projection is to make it look like the person or vehicle on the treadmill is moving. It works every time and looks fake every time, no matter what the movie. Accept it and get over it. And in ''Vertigo'', there was a whole lot of zooming going on in the tower scenes. Was that tacky? I don't think so. The zooming accomplished the purpose in ''Vertigo'' and it does the same in ''Marnie''. So in short I don't think it's right to treat ''Marnie'' as a second-rate film with these arguments as the excuses. I think that's exactly what they are - excuses. I think that the people who say all those things got their glasses mixed up and are simply watching it with tinted glasses over their emotional eyes and a clarifying lens over their critical ones. Well... it's their loss - no one has to like anything, but it would be nice if more people did.I think this review is becoming too long now so I should stop typing before I think of anything else. See this movie at least twice with an open mind. Be like me, an interested spectator in the passing parade - even if you don't get it.",5,"I love it.

Tippi Hedren is wonderful and dynamic as the lead in this film, with a very capable and convincing support crew of Diane Baker and Sean Connery--all this with Alfred Hitchcock directing.I have always enjoyed this film of lying, thieving, psychological childhood trauma, frigidity, and suspense.  In fact, I cannot understand why some people dislike this film.  Furthermore, I do not understand why this is not considered one of his greatest films (although there are so many greats it is easy to see how some films get lost in the shuffle).The story is about a troubled woman, who we meet right after an inside heist job.  From there, we meet her disgruntled mother and learn that their relationship might have a lot to do with Marnie's antisocial and criminal behavior.  The story really takes off when she is hired for another job and meets the handsome and wealthy Mark Rutland.  He notices her instantly and begins to take considerable interest in her.  This and his expertise in female animal abnormal behavior makes for an interesting continuation.I highly recommend this film, although I could see how the psychoanalysis driven ending could turn some folks off.",4,"""The idea was to kill myself, not feed the damn fish""",1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,1204,"['Oh', 'Marnie', 'such', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'wonderful', 'dynamic', 'lead', 'film', 'very', 'capable', 'convincing', 'support', 'crew', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'directing.I', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'lying', 'thieving', 'psychological', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'frigidity', 'suspense', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'dislike', 'film', 'Furthermore', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'not', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'greats', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'films', 'get', 'lost', 'shuffle', '.The', 'story', 'troubled', 'woman', 'who', 'meet', 'right', 'inside', 'heist', 'job', 'there', 'meet', 'disgruntled', 'mother', 'learn', 'relationship', 'might', 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'Marnie', 'antisocial', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'story', 'really', 'off', 'when', 'hired', 'job', 'handsome', 'wealthy', 'Mark', 'Rutland', 'instantly', 'take', 'considerable', 'interest', 'expertise', 'female', 'animal', 'abnormal', 'behavior', 'interesting', 'continuation.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'psychoanalysis', 'driven', 'ending', 'could', 'turn', 'folks', 'off']",N/A

Tippi Hedren stepped in as the leading lady when Grace Kelly bowed out for political reasons, and she gives the best performance of her career. This was the last movie to use all of Hitchcock's ""team,"" and the experience and polish that they learned is all exhibited here. Bernard Herrmann's haunting score is lush and adds much to what is going on. I would highly suggest multiple viewings of this film; each time you will catch more and appreciate the journey that Hitchcock takes you on. I will warn you though; even for a 1964 film, it has many adult themes and is definitely somewhat disturbing in light of its two main characters: a frigid kleptomaniac and her determined suitor who is obsessed with taming her. It was a highly personal movie for Hitchcock; he pushes Vertigo even further and goes to areas that would not have been permitted even 5 years earlier. Briefly, the story is of Marnie (Hedren), a beautiful ice-blonde who makes a habit of moving from city to city and robbing her male employer after she has earned his trust. Things change when she gets a job in Philadelphia working for Rutland & Company, a firm run by the handsome and widowed Mark Rutland (Sean Connery). Mark's scheming young sister-in-law Lil (Diane Baker) doesn't like the romance that she assumes is budding between Marnie & Mark. In reality, he has caught Marnie red-handed and blackmails her into marrying him; he believes he can ""cure"" her of the kleptomania. On the honeymoon, he also discovers she is frigid. The drama intensifies from there...especially once he finds out that Marnie's dead mother (Louise Latham) isn't so dead.The extras include a highly informative Making Of Documentary, with contemporary interviews of Tippi Hedren, Diane Baker, and Louise Latham, as well as a gallery of production/publicity photos.

66511,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0783235690,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 4]","The cheesy backdrops offend the contemporary eye.  The score is obtrusive, even, at times, dictatorial.  Miss Hedren on horseback for the most part isn't, both in the sense that the stunt person is clearly not her, and in the sense that sometimes we can't help but notice that she is in studio with the background moving behind her.  And, as others have pointed out, the red of bloody remembrance that offends Marnie's eyes is a trite and obvious device, not worthy of Hitchcock at his best.  Furthermore, some of the scenes are stagy almost to the point of naivete (but Hitchcock never worried about that as long as his effect was clear).  The scene with the children outside the Baltimore apartment--done twice, actually to set up a third scene in which the children are quiet and stare--comes to mind, as does the scene in front of the Rutland residence as the newly weds are about to depart for their bizarre honeymoon.  Perhaps &quot;artificial&quot; is a better word than &quot;stagy.&quot;  The overall psychology is strictly &quot;Freudian for the Millions,&quot; but with a certain plausibility, while the story itself is far from convincing, regardless of whether you see it from Marnie's viewpoint or from that of Mark Rutland.Nonetheless this uneven psychodrama is an interesting and enjoyable movie, clearly within the hallowed Hitchcock canon, in part due to a haunting performance by Tippi Hedren that will not soon leave my mind.  It is clear that Hitchcock could not take his eyes off of her and neither could I.  This is not to say Miss Hedren was brilliant.  She was not.  But in a sense, because her performance was striking and ordinary by turns, somehow it became--at least for me--indelibly real and entirely believable.  It is to Hedren's credit that, in a movie in which the plot strains credibility at times, she is strikingly real.  She plays the sociopathic office girl from the wrong side of the tracks with intelligence and vulnerability.  Add her great beauty and one can almost believe that the rich, ultra-eligible Mark Rutland would actually to moved to marry her out of obsession and a desire to save her.Alfred Hitchcock's signature technique, in which the plot elements are made childishly clear to even the most inexperienced viewer through audio and visual repetition, camera focus, silence and/or a surging score, is perhaps a bit too much on display here.  Yet, once in motion, the plot plays out very well and we are comfortably ensconced in the world of small business America at mid-century.  Sean Connery, who plays Mark Rutland, gives a fairly convincing performance in an unlikely role.  I was thinking how much more tension might have been created had Rutland been played by somebody less attractive and more menacing.  But Hitchcock rightly insisted on glamour and box office appeal in his leading characters, and sought to win the feminine side of the audience at all costs (therefore only attractive leading men!).  And he was right in following this formula.  One can imagine a remake of Marnie with, say, Nicole Kidman and John Malkovich, both excellent actors; but what would be lost?  And would the movie be as interesting?  We would lose some glamour and charisma--mainstays of the Hitchcock oeuvre--and the result would probably not be as engaging.  Incidentally, Nicole Kidman did play a sociopathic little sickie in To Die For (1995), an underrated film that I recommend.  Comparing performances I have to say that while Nicole was good, Tippi was mesmerizing.The sharp and convincing response of Marnie to the forced marriage in which her frigidity is made manifest owes a lot to Hitchcock's passionate direction.  I have to say though, that this is, in part, a little Hitchcockian joke on his audience.  After all, how many poor little office girls would not delight in being &quot;forced&quot; to marry such a rich and handsome man whose wedding presents include a six and a half caret diamond ring?  In other words, the staples of women's romance--the big house with servants, wealth, and a strong, handsome man who adores the central character and proves it--are very much in evidence amidst the psycho dynamics.  All those who would imitate Hitchcock should keep this point in mind.The script (adapting the novel by Winston Graham) by Jay Presson Allen, who has The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969) and Cabaret (1972) among his credits, contains some attractive dialogue, especially in some of the exchanges between the stars.  An example is Sean Connery's reassuring line to Marnie, &quot;Dad goes by scent.  If you smell anything like a horse, you're in.&quot;Initially, I didn't care for the character of Marnie's mother, played strangely by Louise Latham, but upon reflection she is off beat enough to be real.  The scene (with a cameo of Bruce Dern as a sailor) revealing why Marnie became a pathological liar, a thief and frigid was plausible but not entirely convincing.  The frigidity was understandable given her mother's hatred of men and what happened to her as a little girl, but why she became a sociopath fixated on trying to win her mother's love above all else seemed inconsistent.  The ending is nicely ambiguous, allowing one to draw his or her own conclusion about the effect that such insights will have on Marnie's character.It was nice to see Diane Baker as the girl who doesn't get the guy, and Mariette Hartley as a gossipy secretary.",4,Haunting performance by Tippi Hedren,999993600,"09 9, 2001",2001,5423,"['cheesy', 'offend', 'contemporary', 'eye', 'score',

I don't know whether it was a commercial success or not, but it was not like all the other Hitchcock movies being made.  For one thing, it  had little violence, for another it was a love story.At this time,  folks in the U.S. were shocked to see a breast on screen.  My friend was  projectionist at a drive-in theater where a &quot;risque&quot; Swedish film  called &quot;Summertime&quot; was shown, and a breast was exposed to  traffic on Route 29. As a result, my friend was arrested, and the drive-in  closed down.I saw Marnie again recently, and although there are no  breasts shown, the content was risque, so maybe it was &quot;banned in  Boston&quot; as we used to say. It seems to me &quot;The Legion of  Decency&quot; might not have objected to the film since I saw it at the  time, but I can't remember as I occasionally sneaked out to films without  informing my parents.Marnie has a severe disorder--known as 'frigidity'  -- i.e. she didn't want to have sex with anyone, even her husband (Sean  Connery). That might not be something many young women can identify with  today since &quot;Sex in the City&quot; seems to be the way things go. In  the past, however, a number of women suffered from this problem, many books  discussed it, and films shown in the U.S. were just beginning to address  it.  Sex was something nice girls didn't do--or talk about, although they  'put up with' in marriage.  Well that was the story going around, although  I have reason to believe not all women held that view.The story line of  Marnie is this--she can't and won't have sex with her husband Sean Connery,  so he decides to get at the root cause (he's very motivated and knows it's  not him, even though he blackmailed her into marrying him! ). The mystery  is what caused Marnie (Tippi Hedren) to be the way she is.Gosh can you  imagine anyone resisting Sean Connery? That ought to tell you how troubled  she was.

Marnie is a psychopath who is terrified of sex.  That is a give-away -- psychopaths are not typically afraid of sex.  In 1950s psychoanalysis, repressed memories of trauma drive neurotic or psychopathic behavior, not innate character or social dysfunction.  We have a clue to what will come in Marnie's post-traumatic, hysterical reaction to anything that looks like blood.  Psychoanalysts will see this a menstrual phobia - but, no.Mother-daughter scenes early in the movie are maudlin 1950s conventions of an adult child desperately seeking her cold mother's love, but this ain't Tennessee Williams, kiddies.  Turns out that when Marnie was a child, her mother was violently put upon by Bruce Dern, who also molested Marnie.  While her mother fought off Dern's advances, Marnie beat his skull in with a fireplace iron.  Blood everywhere.  Marnie repressed the memory, and mother took the rap.  Mother considered it a blessing that Marnie had no memory of the killing.  Marnie somehow grew up comfortable with herself as a thief, as though she could accept herself as is.  But in the final scene with mother, we learn that mother has warned her to have nothing to do with men, and that Marnie considers sex indecent.  Marnie can be a decent person regardless of her white collar criminality just as long as she avoids sex with men.Sean Connery is the perfect chick-flick hero here, caring deeply for Marnie and helping her to heal her relationship with her mother. What more can a woman ask of a man?Hard to see Hitch as he seems to be portrayed in recent film, as a perv, since this movie is really very wholesome.  The 1950s style makes it hard to take this film seriously, and sexual references are subtle, but the film is worth a gander, and maybe a goose as well.",4,Best use of Psychology in a Hitch film,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1983,"['Spoiler', 'alert', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'why', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'revealing', 'tidbit', 'very', 'end', 'one', 'might', 'miss', 'throwaway', 'line.This', 'mother-daughter', 'movie', 'sentimental', 'chick-flick', 'Marnie', 'psychopath', 'who', 'terrified', 'sex', 'give-away', 'psychopaths', 'are', 'not', 'typically', 'afraid', 'sex', '1950s', 'psychoanalysis', 'repressed', 'memories', 'trauma', 'drive', 'neurotic', 'psychopathic', 'behavior', 'not', 'innate', 'character', 'social', 'dysfunction', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'will', 'come', 'Marnie', 'post-traumatic', 'hysterical', 'reaction', 'anything', 'blood', 'Psychoanalysts', 'will', 'see', 'menstrual', 'phobia', 'no.Mother-daughter', 'scenes', 'early', 'movie', 'are', 'maudlin', '1950s', 'conventions', 'adult', 'child', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'cold', 'mother', 'love', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'kiddies', 'out', 'when', 'Marnie', 'was', 'child', 'mother', 'was', 'violently', 'put', 'upon', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'who', 'also', 'molested', 'Marnie', 'mother', 'fought', 'off', 'Dern', 'advances', 'Marnie', 'beat', 'skull', 'fireplace', 'iron', 'Blood', 'everywhere', 'Marnie', 'repressed', 'memory', 'took', 'rap', 'considered', 'blessing', 'Marnie', 'had', 'memory', 'killing', 'Marnie', 'somehow', 'grew', 'up', 'comfortable', 'thief', 'could', 'accept', 'final', 'scene', 'mother', 'learn', 'mother', 'warned', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'men', 'Marnie', 'considers', 'sex', 'indecent', 'Marnie', 'can', 'be', 'decent', 'person', 'regardless', 'white', 'collar', 'criminality', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'sex', 'men.Sean', 'Connery', 'perfect', 'chick-flick', 'hero', 'here', 'caring', 'deeply', 'Marnie', 'helping', 'heal', 'relationship', 'mother', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'woman', 'ask', 'man', 'Hard', 'see', 'Hitch', 'be', 'portrayed', 'recent', 'film', 'perv', 'movie', 'really', 'very', 'wholesome', '1950s', 'style', 'hard', 'take', 'film', 'seriously', 'sexual', 'references', 'are', 'subtle', 'film', 'gander', 'maybe', 'goose', 'well']",N/A

I can believe that someone like her exists; just as I can believe Tippi Hedren's narrow-gauge, jittery portrayal of her.

Repaying the costs of her thefts around the countryside?

She's defiant, independent, resourceful. She's a survivor and we cannot help but love her for that. Granted, her psyche is like jambalaya on a bad day (and I won't spoil the ending for you), but she does experience moments of pure happiness when she rides her horse, Forio. Not ten minutes into the film, her bad self washed down the drain, there she is with her hair loose, a youthful expression of relief on her face, riding Forio off into the distance. Yes, this is her fantasy world, but she's truly happy there. Unfortunately, and all too soon, Forio turns into a yellow cab which deposits her back where it all began.Marnie comes from the lower class, born of a single mother, growing up during the war in a poor neighborhood on the waterfront in Baltimore. What were her alternatives? Through the film we see them. She could be a prostitute like her broken mother. She could be a secretary like the chatty, loyal gals in the washroom after work at Rutland's. In some wild scenario she could marry into money. Or...she could just take what she thinks she deserves. Certainly one or two of those wealthy folks at the fox hunt must have gotten their money in less than legal ways, considering how Hitchcock makes them look as they laugh at an animal being torn to bits by the hounds. Does Mark Rutland even know that an old, shabbily dressed and tired washer woman scrubs his floors every night? When Marnie robs the Rutland safe, we see, in a split screen, a well dressed Marnie on the right and the poor washer woman on the left. Marnie risks her precious freedom to avoid what she fears would be a dull and oppressive life. This scene embodies that split in her, drudgery or crime, and not much in between.Along with Hitchcock's social commentary is extensive play on the prey vs. predator/territorialism/survival of the fittest theme. Color symbolism (reds and yellows), water imagery, and the endless wordplay and double-entendres of Jay Allen's (The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and Cabaret) terrific screenplay make Marnie a joy to watch again and again.

66524,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0783235690,Erik North,"[5, 6]","Alfred Hitchcock's 1964 film MARNIE is one that consistently divides fans of the director into two camps.  Some say this is as good as anything he ever did, just a little different; others, though, say that it's one of his weakest efforts.  As with a lot of things, the truth lies somewhere in between.Sean Connery stars as the head of a company who hires on a woman named Marnie (Tippi Hedren) as a payroll clerk.  He doesn't suspect at first that the new employee is an obsessive-compulsive thief of large sums of greenbacks, but he catches on fast.  But he also comes to suspect that Hedren's troubles go much deeper than the mere stealing of money.  Hedren behaves very coldly towards him or any man, but they somehow begin a relationship, and Connery delves into Hedren's past, where a dark secret awaits.MARNIE can't exactly be called one of the Master's best; the rear projection visuals have become just a bit too obvious, and the story doesn't necessarily have the punch of Hitchcock's earlier romantic thrillers like VERTIGO or REAR WINDOW.  Nevertheless, it does have a fairly solid performance from Hedren, coming off her star-making turn in Hitchcock's 1963 horror classic THE BIRDS, as well as Connery, who by then had become an international star after three James Bond movies.  MARNIE also marked the last time Hitchcock would work with composer Bernard Herrmann; and Herrmann doesn't let his boss down, providing a very effective score.One thing that doesn't get mentioned much, if at all, is that MARNIE seems to have had an influence (probably a coincidental one) on Brian DePalma's 1976 horror classic CARRIE, in that Hedren's troubles include a mother (Louise Latham) with a vicious hatred of men and a willingness to religiously oppress her daughter (in CARRIE, it's Piper Laurie doing likewise to Sissy Spacek), and a male figure (Connery in MARNIE; William Katt in CARRIE) trying to get into the mind of the woman and get her to open up about her fears.This fascinating parallel by itself makes MARNIE worth considering again.  Sure, it has its flaws, and it is imperfect Hitchcock, but in comparison to all those films that consistently ape the Master of Suspense, it's better than most.",4,"Imperfect Hitchcock, But Better Than Most",1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,2212,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', '1964', 'film', 'MARNIE', 'one', 'consistently', 'fans', 'director', 'two', 'camps', 'say', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'ever', 'did', 'just', 'little', 'different', 'others', 'say', 'one', 'weakest', 'efforts', 'lot', 'things', 'truth', 'somewhere', 'between.Sean', 'Connery', 'stars', 'head', 'company', 'who', 'woman', 'named', 'Marnie', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'payroll', 'clerk', ""n't"", 'suspect', 'first', 'new', 'employee', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'thief', 'large', 'sums', 'greenbacks', 'fast', 'also', 'suspect', 'Hedren', 'troubles', 'go', 'much', 'deeper', 'mere', 'stealing', 'money', 'Hedren', 'very', 'coldly', 'man', 'somehow', 'begin', 'relationship', 'Connery', 'Hedren', 'past', 'where', 'dark', 'secret', 'awaits.MARNIE', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'be', 'called', 'one', 'Master', 'best', 'rear', 'projection', 'visuals', 'have', 'become', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'obvious', 'story', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'punch', 'Hitchcock', 'earlier', 'romantic', 'thrillers', 'VERTIGO', 'REAR', 'WINDOW', 'Nevertheless', 'have', 'fairly', 'solid', 'performance', 'Hedren', 'coming', 'off', 'star-making', 'turn', 'Hitchcock', '1963', 'horror', 'classic', 'THE', 'BIRDS', 'as', 'well', 'Connery', 'who', 'then', 'had', 'become', 'international', 'star', 'three', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'MARNIE', 'also', 'marked', 'last', 'time', 'Hitchcock', 'would', 'work', 'composer', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'Herrmann', ""n't"", 'let', 'boss', 'down', 'providing', 'very', 'effective', 'score.One', 'thing', ""n't"", 'get', 'mentioned', 'much', 'MARNIE', 'have', 'had', 'influence', 'probably', 'coincidental', 'one', 'Brian', 'DePalma', '1976', 'horror', 'classic', 'CARRIE', 'Hedren', 'troubles', 'include', 'mother', 'Louise', 'Latham', 'vicious', 'hatred', 'men', 'willingness', 'religiously', 'oppress', 'daughter', 'CARRIE', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'doing', 'likewise', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'male', 'figure', 'Connery', 'MARNIE', 'William', 'Katt', 'CARRIE', 'trying', 'get', 'mind', 'woman', 'get', 'open', 'up', 'fears.This', 'fascinating', 'parallel', 'MARNIE', 'worth', 'considering', 'again', 'Sure', 'flaws', 'imperfect', 'Hitchcock', 'comparison', 'films', 'consistently', 'Master', 'Suspense', 'better', 'most']",N/A

66527,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,0783235690,Gary P. Cohen,"[0, 0]","I remember seeing Marnie in the summer of 1964 and being disappointed by it.  True, I was only 14 at the time and probably did not understand aspects of it.  But coming out a little more than one year after The Birds, my favorite Hitchcock film, Marnie seemed slow-moving and disappointing.  And I was not the only one who thought this as the film was a critical and financial failure.Now the film has been re-evaluated all these years later and is considered one of Hitchcock's best by many critics and myself.  I saw it on a film screen at a Hitchcock retrospective in Manhattan the other day and the audience seemed to be thoroughly enjoying it.Marnie was the film that Hitchcock hoped to use to entice Princess Grace (Kelly) back to the screen.  It is hard to imagine the Princess of Monaco starring as lying, sexually frigid, thief with numerous psychological problems.When Grace turned it down, Hitchcock turned to Tippi Hedren who had just done such a marvelous job as Melanie Daniels in The Birds.  What happened during the making of this film is part of Hollywood legend.  Supposedly Hitchcock made some advances towards his beautiful leading lady and was rebuffed.  He then allegedly lost interest in the film and Tippi was made to sink or swim on her own.  Whatever happened, her performance is excellent in a very difficult role.  Sad that as a result of this film, this was Tippi's last major starring role.  Co-starring was the young Sean Connery who had recently completed Dr. No and was about to start From Russia With Love (although FRWL was released before Marnie in the U.S.)  Connery's towering charisma is apparent here and one can see why he was and still is the best James Bond.The excellent supporting cast includes the very pretty Diane Baker, one of my favorite young actresses of the 1960s, as Connery's late wife's sister, Alan Napier, later Alfred the butler on the Batman tv series, as Connery's father, a very young and pretty Mariette Hartley as a secretary and in a small but pivotal role, a young Bruce Dern.  (Dern's appearance near the end created a stir in the audience when I saw it the other day.)  I met Dern a couple years ago and when I asked him what it was like to appear in Hitchcock's last film &#34;Family Plot,&#34; he reminded me that he appeared in this Hitchcock film as well.  Still this is Hedren's film and she is wonderful in it.There was some complaints at the time about Hitchcock's over-use of rear projection and mattes in this film.  Now the critics seem to feel that these unrealistic backgrounds was Hitchcock's way of portraying the confusion and psychiatric issues tormenting Marnie.  Whether this is true I don't know.  It is funny to now hear a film praised for the reason it was once condemned.In conclusion, this is probably Hitchcock's last great film with a fascinating script and a terrific cast.  As stated, it has been re-evaluated in recent years and based on what I saw after seeing it with a live audience the other day, if you have not seen it, you probably should.",5,The wonderful Tippi Hedren and the dashing Sean Connery in a Hitccock Classic.,1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,3042,"['remember', 'seeing', 'Marnie', 'summer', '1964', 'being', 'disappointed', 'True', 'was', 'only', '14', 'time', 'probably', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'aspects', 'coming', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'one', 'year', 'Birds', 'favorite', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'Marnie', 'seemed', 'slow-moving', 'disappointing', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'critical', 'financial', 'failure.Now', 'film', 'been', 're-evaluated', 'years', 'later', 'considered', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'many', 'critics', 'saw', 'film', 'screen', 'Hitchcock', 'retrospective', 'Manhattan', 'other', 'day', 'audience', 'seemed', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'it.Marnie', 'was', 'film', 'Hitchcock', 'hoped', 'use', 'entice', 'Princess', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'back', 'screen', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Princess', 'Monaco', 'starring', 'lying', 'sexually', 'frigid', 'thief', 'numerous', 'psychological', 'problems.When', 'Grace', 'turned', 'down', 'Hitchcock', 'turned', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'done', 'marvelous', 'job', 'Melanie', 'Daniels', 'Birds', 'What', 'happened', 'making', 'film', 'part', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'Supposedly', 'Hitchcock', 'made', 'advances', 'beautiful', 'leading', 'lady', 'was', 'rebuffed', 'then', 'allegedly', 'lost', 'interest', 'film', 'Tippi', 'was', 'made', 'sink', 'swim', 'own', 'happened', 'performance', 'excellent', 'very', 'difficult', 'role', 'Sad', 'result', 'film', 'was', 'Tippi', 'last', 'major', 'starring', 'role', 'Co-starring', 'was', 'young', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'completed', 'Dr.', 'No', 'was', 'about', 'start', 'From', 'Russia', 'Love', 'FRWL', 'was', 'released', 'Marnie', 'U.S.', 'Connery', 'towering', 'charisma', 'apparent', 'here', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'still', 'best', 'James', 'Bond.The', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'pretty', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'one', 'favorite', 'young', 'actresses', '1960s', 'Connery', 'late', 'wife', 'sister', 'Alan', 'Napier', 'later', 'Alfred', 'butler', 'Batman', 'tv', 'series', 'Connery', 'father', 'very', 'young', 'pretty', 'Mariette', 'Hartley', 'secretary', 'small', 'pivotal', 'role', 'young', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Dern', 'appearance', 'end', 'created', 'stir', 'audience', 'when', 'saw', 'other', 'day', 'met', 'Dern', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'asked', 'what', 'was', 'appear', 'Hitchcock', 'last', 'film', '34', 'Family', 'Plot', '34', 'reminded', 'appeared', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Still', 'Hedren', 'film', 'wonderful', 'it.There', 'was', 'complaints', 'time', 'Hitchcock', 'over-use', 'rear', 'projection', 'mattes', 'film', 'Now', 'critics', 'seem', 'feel', 'unrealistic', 'backgrounds', 'was', 'Hitchcock', 'way', 'portraying', 'confusion', 'psychiatric', 'issues', 'tormenting', 'Marnie', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'funny', 'now', 'hear', 'film', 'praised', 'reason', 'was', 'once', 'condemned.In', 'conclusion', 'probably', 'Hitchcock', 'last', 'great', 'film', 'fascinating', 'script', 'terrific', 'cast', 'stated', 'been', 're-evaluated', 'recent', 'years', 'based', 'what', 'saw', 'seeing', 'live', 'audience', 'other', 'day', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'probably', 'should']",N/A

The prolific Robin Wood, to a somewhat Freudian degree, has been a steadfast proponent of this film's penetrating affect on its characters, viewer reaction and Hitchcock's overall intent. It is not a straightforward narrative as it deals with the compulsive and obsessive nature of its two main characters (Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery). The viewer has to become absorbed and drawn into the film's sights and sounds. The viewer has to elicit from what is seen and heard to fathom the motivations of the film's two main characters. Some of its images are just unforgettable and disturbingly haunting. Many of these are process shots that evoke deep emotional responses for their somewhat obvious visual unreality. Sound too plays an important part in the viewer's experience. In accompaniment is Bernard Herrmann's low-key score. I watched this film again several times over. Herrmann's score is always present, yet never intrusive. I used to think this score was somewhat repetitive, but it is quite diverse. It complements the images in such a way that it almost evokes some hidden and suppressed experience from the viewer that creates an emotional bond with the main title character of the film.

Also, the script is wordy and the plot moves slowly; clocking in at well over two hours, Marnie hardly has enough substance to excuse its length.Still, I feel that dual strong performances by Hendren and Connery (he should be remembered as much for this film as for any of his Bond roles) build a sort of momentum, eventually overcoming the latent torpor of the film.

66537,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0783235690,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 5]","This film is extremely powerful because it centers on a woman who obviously has a problem, not an accident but a problem. We know very fast she is having many identities and that her main objective in the jobs she gets with her charm more than her references is to steal the cash from the firm's safe and leave. We understand she is taking care of a mother of hers with that money more than of herself. One man, one of his employers, officially the fifth one, will though go through the surface and discover who she really is, but he falls in love with her and, being a sort of anthropologist (zoologist is the word he uses, isn't it?) and psychologist, he is fascinated by her criminal personality and her fears and he decides to get her out of both. He has to bring her back to the trauma she lived when a small child and confront her with her own mother and the truth. And she is finally liberated from the fear caused by the absence of conscious memory of her crime at the time. I won't say more on the details. I am interested in the way Hitchcock builds his own case little by little and brings us to the point when the trauma can be relived and revealed. Yet I find his social psychology a little bit simple altogether. He only centers on the negative elements. He should have shown how ambiguous the girl must have been at the time with the two adults she was confronted to and with herself and her own act that made her accept her mother telling a lie to save her, because a child who has committed a crime understands very well when the adult covers his or her mistake and then the feelings are always ambiguous and it is that ambiguity that makes the child forget about the incident that becomes a trauma. The liberation is also absolutely too mechanical to be real. Yes there often is an illumination that is sudden but then the transformation of the traumatized individual is long because the trauma left a lot of traces, blocking elements or just gremlins in the head of the traumatized one. But Hitchcock does it very well. In 1964 he could only be inspired by Freud of whom he proposes a simplified reading, but today he would appear as a disciple of Ron L. Hubbard because dianetics is just what this film is, a mechanical and simplified version of psychoanalysis.

66542,AT04V4H3AO3T5,0783235690,Jeremy W. Forstadt,"[4, 5]","The consensus here seems to be that MARNIE is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most underrated films. I happen to agree. In fact, I find MARNIE, on the whole, to be more appealing than Tippi Hedren's first Hitchcock film, THE BIRDS. Here, Hedren plays Marnie Edgar, a pathologically frigid and emotionless woman who is also a compulsive liar and thief. Sean Connery plays Mark Rutland, a playboy type who develops a fetish-like desire for Marnie, evidently because she is a thief and because he can exert control over her because of that fact. Marnie's professional method is to gain employment as a payroll clerk and then rob the company she is working for. Afterwards, she changes identities and moves on to the next job. Rutland, a client of one of her previous victims, immediately hires her when he recognizes her after she comes in to interview for a job with his own firm. She fails to recognize Rutland.Rutland initially establishes control over Marnie when he catches her burglarizing his business but doesn't turn her in. Though she is resentful of his hold over her, she consents to marry him. Rutledge further infuriates her and increases his grip over her when he begins paying back the employers she has robbed in the past. Due to what is becoming increasingly clear was a traumatic episode in her childhood, Marnie has an almost pathological need to be independent of men in her life, a need that is also constantly drummed into her by her domineering mother. However, she is becoming increasingly unstable due to Rutland's imposed dominance over her.Despite being a deeply damaged woman psychologically, Marnie is given some fresh, often sarcastic dialogue in this film, some of which I found to be extremely funny.LIL MAINWARING: How do you take your tea...?MARNIE EDGAR: Usually with a cup of hot water and a tea bag.After Rutland physically forces himself on Marnie during their honeymoon cruise, the profoundly neurotic Marnie attempts to drown herself in the ship's swimming pool.MARK RUTLAND: Well why didn't you jump over the side [of the ship]?MARNIE EDGAR: The idea was to kill myself - not feed the damn fish.The suspense which Hitchcock characteristically builds and sustains throughout his movies here centers on the mystery of Marnie's past and the seemingly impending collision between her and Rutland which promises to end badly, if not tragically. A man's sinister and forced possession of a woman could and has been an effective device in other films like Hitchcock's own SUSPICION and George Cukor's GASLIGHT--both suspense classics--but Hitch is going in another direction here and portrays Rutland as more protective and caring partner and Marnie as the ticking time bomb in this film.In the end, Rutland is successful in chasing down Marnie's past, the climactic revelation of which is a suitable end note to the nightmarish atmosphere of the movie. Suspenseful, tragic, even funny throughout, there is an apparent and satisfying redemption to be found at the end of MARNIE. The film is not perfect, however. Rutland's motivations throughout the movie are inscrutable at best, and the humor is not as sharp or consistent as we have come to expect from Hitchcock's better productions. Though many feel that Hitchcock was finished after PSYCHO--his last true masterpiece--I feel that MARNIE, flawed though it is and as unsuccessful at the box office as it was, can still be called a great film, perhaps his last great film of his remarkable career.Jeremy W.

66546,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,0783235690,Joker,"[2, 2]","Just some thoughts...Marnie (1964) is considered by many to be Alfred Hitchcock's last great movie.  This movie is certainly different from most of Hitchcock's movies.  Most of Hitchcock's movies have a certain signature Hitchcock ""feel"" to them, much like John Carpenter, Stephen Spielberg, and George Lucas movies have a certain signature ""feel"" to them that are vintage Carpenter, Spielberg, and Lucas.  Marnie retains a lot of the Hitchcock feel, but this movie is a slight departure from his previous work.  This movie really can't be classified into one category, such as a straight psychological thriller, a suspense thriller, a detective story, a mystery, a romance, etc.  Whereas most Hitchcock movies put less focus on the characters and more focus on the suspense, Marnie puts most of the focus on one character and less focus on the suspense.  This movie is highly personal and psychological.  This movie stars `Tippi' Hedren, Sean Connery, Diane Baker, Louise Latham, Mariette Hartley, Martin Gabel, and Alan Napier.  Hedren plays the role of Margaret ""Marnie"" Edgar, a strange woman with psychological problems who is a professional thief, a liar, has multiple identities, and has an intense fear of men, thunderstorms, and even the color red.  To sum up the plot in a nutshell, she empties her employer's safe, escapes, and changes her identity and appearance.  Sean Connery plays the role of Mark Rutland, owner of a publishing company that Marnie applies for a new job at.  Marnie robs him as well.  He tracks her down.  However, Rutland is infatuated with her.  Rather than turning her in to the authorities, he convinces her to marry him, sort of like blackmail.  While on their honeymoon, he realizes that she actually has a fear of men and fears intimacy.  Frustrated, he gets more aggressive with her, resulting in her attempting suicide.  Her intense fear of men is rooted in a traumatic childhood experience she had.  Watch to find out how everything unfolds.The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is memorable and is one of the strong points of the movie. The score is one of the best of all the Hitchcock movies, in my opinion (my other candidates are Vertigo and Psycho).  There are some suspenseful moments.  The special effects and some of the sets are pretty simple and low tech, but this doesn't detract from the film at all, in my opinion.The acting is excellent.  Sean Connery was excellent.  It was great to see Alan Napier (Alfred from the 1960s Batman TV series) in the movie.  I thought `Tippi' Hedren's performance was outstanding.  Her acting in The Birds (1963) was great, but she takes things to another level in Marnie.  Hitchcock wanted Grace Kelly to play the role of Marnie, but she had to back out after initially accepting the role.  I think 'Tippi' Hedren was the perfect actress for the part, and she delivered.  I also like Diane Baker in this movie.  I have a weakness for movies with good looking women in them.This movie did poorly at the box office when it was released, probably because audiences were used to getting movies that were less personal, less psychological, and more suspenseful from Hitchcock each time, and Marnie was a departure from that.  However, this movie's stature has grown immensely since 1964.  As for myself, this is one of those rare movies that drew me in right from the start and kept my attention, but multiple viewings might be required in order for one to fully understand and appreciate it for what it is.The DVD's extras include a documentary called The Trouble With Marnie, which basically is about the making of the movie and the movie's historical status, a picture gallery called The Marnie Archives, and the theatrical trailer.Overall, this is a good Hitchcock flick if you're into this type of movie, whatever it's classified as.

Young MarnieOne of Hitchcock's masterpieces, and like many other of his efforts, a psychological drama.Marnie (Tippi Hedren) was a kleptomaniac, a compulsive thief.  She supported her mother, Bernice Edgar (Louise Latham), who was a stern, domineering person of religious conviction with high standards of personal conduct, and who had turned her daughter into a man-hater.Enter Mark Rutland (Sean Connery) who marries Marnie, knowing that she is a thief and liar, but unaware of all of her serious hang-ups.  However, as the problems begin to surface, he tries to solve them.Grace Kelly was originally considered for the part of Marnie, but was already the princess of Monaco and her subjects were less than enthusiastic about it, and besides, the picture was being made by Universal while she was still under contract to MGM, so she dropped the idea and never again considered a movie career.  This was also an early effort in the career of Sean Connery, before his series as James Bond.An entertaining film, with good acting throughout, and the excellent direction of Hitchcock, with his usual trademark cameo.

Of course, those films were peopled with legends like Ingrid Bergman, Eva Marie Saint, Gregory Peck, Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, Jimmy Stewart, Doris Day, Joseph Cotten, Teresa Wright, James Mason, Martin Landau, etc.The first problem, of course, is Hedren, with her dreadful high voice and not a vestige of thespian talent.  Hedren's simpering would embarrass the star of your high-school play and makes Gwyneth Paltrow look like Cate Blanchett.  The second problem is an awful script filled with cheap symbolism and impossibly immediate resolution, with bad lines that Hedren's delivery turns into High Camp. The script and its dramatically challenged female star lumber about like elephants in a tea-room.Connery, to do him credit, gave it his best shot, but how he kept a straight face playing to Hedren and wrapping his mouth around some of these lines is the only truly suspenseful aspect of the film.  But even his charisma allied to an intelligent and sincere effort can't save the film from the aura of failure that clings to it, from its beknighted star to its clunky script to its painfully obvious backdrops.""Marnie"" is the story of a young woman (Hedren) who makes her living by infiltrating companies as a bookkeeper, and then embezzling their money, changing identities, and moving on to a new location and a new company.  As the film opens, Marnie is doing just that: we see her changing suitcases, packing new clothing and accessories, selecting one of several Social Security cards to anchor the next phase of her existence, and rinsing dark dye out of her hair until she lifts a dazzling golden head out of the sink.We also see Marnie paying a visit to her mother in Baltimore, who lives alone and is lame enough to need a cane to walk.  It's clear the relationship between mother and daughter is, shall we say, tricky: the rigid, emotionally cold Mom doles out only grudging bits of affection to her desperately needy daughter - whose career Mom knows nothing about.Then Marnie moves on to her next target, the Rutland Company, located somewhere in Virginia, in horse country, where she gets a nice job sitting about 12 feet from the company safe, whose combination lock the manager (contrary to every logical rule of security) is always opening in full view of his employees.  When he can't remember the combination, which happens twice a day, he shakes his head in full view of the employees, walks back to his desk in full view of his employees, and pulls out the drawer where he keeps the combination and peers into it, muttering the numbers to himself, in full view of his employees.  The only wonder here is that Marnie is the first employee to take advantage of the manager's stupidity and burgle the safe.  My old Mum could have done it, easily.But before Marnie (calling herself Margaret Edgar, Edgar being her real last name) can get her hands on the goods, she comes to the attention of the Rutland Company's heir, Mark Rutland (Connery).  Attracted to her great legs, blonde looks, and ladylike air, Mark requests her secretarial services over the weekend.  As they work, Mark notices several things about Mrs. Edgar: she's terrified of the color red and of thunderstorms, she shares with him an interest in horses (horses=sexual sublimation, get it? get it?), and she's sexually indifferent to him, something that he isn't used to (although I can't think why. . .:))The intrigued Mark not only begins keeping an eye on Marnie but after he overhears a guest at one of his father's parties insist that he recognizes her as the beautiful brunette who ran off with his company's money, decides to to do some detective work.  Mark uncovers Marnie's prior identity and her flight with her former employer's cash.  But rather than turning her in, Mark gives her a choice: marry him or go to jail.  If she marries him, he will pay back the money she stole so the case against her is dropped.  Marnie is forced to agree to this heinous blackmail, squeaking, ""And then YOU take possession of ME!!!""As we now know that Marnie has a BIG problem with men and sex, Mark's ""bargain"" has a deliciously prurient edge due to the absurdity of Marnie quailing before the idea of hooking the handsome, AND rich, AND sympathetic, AND intelligent Rutland (rut=sex, get it? get it?) in the persona of the staggeringly desirable Connery.  To the dismay of his widowed sister-in-law, Lil (Diane Baker), who lives with Mark and his father in their grand home and has been trying to seduce Mark for ages (that's men for you: reject them and they chase you; be too available and you're invisible!), Mark marries Marnie, giving her an eleven-carat diamond engagement ring.  When someone wonders why Mark didn't give Marnie his dead mother's ring, Lil, who harbors suspicions about Marnie herself, replies sourly, ""He said he wanted her to have something that had never belonged to anyone else.""Marnie and Mark head off to their wedding night and honeymoon on a luxury ocean liner. Sure enough, Marnie can't go through with consummating the marriage - pressured by the eager groom, she goes into a state of catatonic shock at finding herself naked in a stateroom with Sean Connery.  (Well, I'd have been stunned myself, but. . .)The shock of being deflowered (it's a sure bet that Marnie is a virgin) by her (rich gorgeous intelligent) new husband under these circumstances prompts Marnie to try to drown herself by throwing herself into the liner's Olympic-sized deck pool. When Mark pulls her out and revives her, he asks her why she didn't just throw herself overboard, to which the choking Marnie replies with this deathless line: ""The point was to kill myself, not feed the fish.""The script is a minefield of such lines, and while Hedren's delivery reduces them to hilarity, one can only wonder if even some of Hitch's formidably talented previous leading ladies could have redeemed them.The film charges to its conclusion as Mark, determined to get to the bottom of Marnie's fears of red, thunderstorms, sex, and men, tracks down her mother. He discovers that the cold, straitlaced, Bible-totin' Mrs. Edgar is not a widow at all, but was an unwed teenaged mother who, in order to support her little girl, became a hooker, and one night brought home a drunken sailor (an early cameo by Bruce Dern) that the six-year-old Marnie murdered by hitting him over the head with the poker when she saw him struggling with her mother (hence the limp).  Needless to say, during this event, much RED blood was spilled, and a THUNDERSTORM was occurring, and Marnie has repressed all memory of the events, presumably including the trial and endless interviews with police and social services.  And that, children, as the British say, is how the little white bunny rabbit got its fluffy tail!In a scene worthy of ""Saturday Night Live"", after much sturm und drang, Mark brings Marnie home and forces Mrs. Edgar to tell Marnie the truth about what happened that night, as Mom snarls, ""Yew-git-outta-mah-HOWSE!""  Ditto how, as a result of the murder and the subsequent trial, Mom changed her ways and vowed that if the authorities let her keep the traumatized little Marnie, ""Ah'd bring ya up decent!"" I.e., as a respectable, God-fearin', frigid Christian woman who would rather die than have a man touch her - even her lawfully consecrated husband - even when said lawfully consecrated husband is vintage 1964 Sean Connery.  ""She's LUCKY to be that-a way, she's LUCKY!"" Mom cries when Mark protests that her daughter is living only half a life.Presto!  Like magic, once the truth is out, Marnie's problems fade like snow in the sunshine.  As they step outside her mother's little Baltimore row house, against a manifestly fake backdrop of the Delaware River waterfront (where a thunderstorm has just passed and the sun is now emerging - get it? get it?), Marnie quivers in that tinny voice, ""Mark, I don't want to go to jail.  I'd rather stay with you.""  Mark: ""Had you, love?""  Fadeout.This is one of the worst scripts ever written, way below Hitch's usual standards.  It has the feel of those old paint-by-numbers kits, a sensation sharpened by the hapless Hedren, who can't rightly be called an actress at all.Campy to the max, the film deserves all the sneers that have been heaped upon it.  However, do watch it once: you'll be amazed at how some of the funniest lines come in handy over the years.  And for you Connery fans, himself at his stunning best makes it worth at least one viewing.",2,Lesser (Much Lesser) Hitchcock,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,9064,"['presence', 'sublimely', 'gorgeous',

66555,A1JUUQ9N15R0LE,0783235690,Laurie Lear,"[4, 7]","Ever since I first discovered Alfred Hitchcock at the ages of 9 and 10, I have always been infatuated with his finest picture (in my opinion), ""Marnie.""The film itself combines so many classic Hitchcock-ian camera and script sequences, that it's almost easy to miss some of his more 'eccentric' uses of story and structure in the film; it's a great combination of the unforgettable Hitch and the still learning, advancing Hitch, and for this, I find this almost 'crossroads' film to be extremely enjoyable and exciting.Tippi Hedren really shines in the picture as Marnie Edgar, a mentally troubled woman due to events that she has blocked subconsciously from her memory, and because of this repression, she is a martyr to a disease of fits and kleptomania.However, her psychological state is put at even greater peril once she meets Sean Connery, who she unwittingly marries against better judgment, and is subsequently raped on her Honeymoon, leading to an attempt at suicide.Tippi's Marnie is a troubled soul.Now, you could easily write this off as merely a film of the brutality of masculinity and the submissive state of the Female, due to the rather scrambled ending where Marnie comes to terms with the beginnings of her illness, but in all sincerity, this (in my mind) is the farthest thing from what the film is actually trying to say.  The fact is, that Marnie and Sean's Rutland, were never really in love.  Tippi's character was troubled and lucky for her, Sean was there to help her through the turmoil, though his frustration did lead to unnecessary battles, such as the rape scene, which only lead Marnie further and further into a repressed state.He was no psychologist, that's for sure, but he was still there and the sexual intensity between the two was created from this almost sadomasochistic battle of dominance and unresponsiveness.  But to say that, is once again, a lie. That is only on the surface; it is naive to say that it was just coincidence that Rutland was the man who acted above her, but when dealing with the time this film was made, and with the situations it presented, it is also foolish to think that this picture was anti-female liberation.I do not like to think of films in that manner, and I certainly don't intend to do so with a favorite film of mine.  I enjoy it for the beauty that it is, and not for the supposed women-are-the-lesser-sex ideals that might make it seem attractive for people to watch from a political standpoint.This film was not political for me: it was a fantastic story, set with wonderfully attractive characters that the audience can really sink their teeth into, and I am proud that it is being re-released on DVD, even if the only real change from this version is the cover art.  At least it's being given respect, along with some time and effort, to make it available to those who would like to see some of Hitchcock's lesser known films.""The Colours...Stop the Colours""",5,Charming Film; Don't-be-so-Political,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,2940,"['Ever', 'first', 'discovered', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'ages', '9', '10', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'infatuated', 'finest', 'picture', 'opinion', 'Marnie', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'classic', 'Hitchcock-ian', 'camera', 'script', 'sequences', 'almost', 'easy', 'miss', 'more', ""'eccentric"", 'uses', 'story', 'structure', 'film', 'great', 'combination', 'unforgettable', 'Hitch', 'still', 'learning', 'advancing', 'Hitch', 'find', 'almost', 'film', 'be', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'exciting.Tippi', 'Hedren', 'really', 'picture', 'Marnie', 'Edgar', 'mentally', 'troubled', 'woman', 'due', 'events', 'blocked', 'subconsciously', 'memory', 'repression', 'martyr', 'disease', 'fits', 'kleptomania.However', 'psychological', 'state', 'put', 'even', 'greater', 'peril', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'marries', 'better', 'judgment', 'subsequently', 'raped', 'Honeymoon', 'leading', 'attempt', 'suicide.Tippi', 'Marnie', 'troubled', 'soul.Now', 'could', 'easily', 'write', 'off', 'as', 'merely', 'film', 'brutality', 'masculinity', 'submissive', 'state', 'Female', 'due', 'rather', 'scrambled', 'ending', 'where', 'Marnie', 'terms', 'beginnings', 'illness', 'sincerity', 'mind', 'farthest', 'thing', 'what', 'film', 'actually', 'trying', 'say', 'fact', 'Marnie', 'Sean', 'Rutland', 'were', 'never', 'really', 'love', 'Tippi', 'character', 'was', 'troubled', 'lucky', 'Sean', 'was', 'there', 'help', 'turmoil', 'frustration', 'did', 'lead', 'unnecessary', 'battles', 'such', 'rape', 'scene', 'only', 'lead', 'Marnie', 'further', 'further', 'repressed', 'state.He', 'was', 'psychologist', 'sure', 'was', 'still', 'there', 'sexual', 'intensity', 'two', 'was', 'created', 'almost', 'sadomasochistic', 'battle', 'dominance', 'unresponsiveness', 'say', 'once', 'again', 'lie', 'only', 'surface', 'naive', 'say', 'was', 'just', 'coincidence', 'Rutland', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'acted', 'when', 'dealing', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'situations', 'presented', 'also', 'foolish', 'think', 'picture', 'was', 'anti-female', 'liberation.I', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'films', 'manner', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'do', 'so', 'favorite', 'film', 'mine', 'enjoy', 'beauty', 'not', 'supposed', 'women-are-the-lesser-sex', 'ideals', 'might', 'make', 'seem', 'attractive', 'people', 'watch', 'political', 'standpoint.This', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'political', 'was', 'fantastic', 'story', 'set', 'wonderfully', 'attractive', 'characters', 'audience', 'can', 'really', 'sink', 'teeth', 'am', 'proud', 'being', 're-released', 'DVD', 'even', 'only', 'real', 'change', 'version', 'cover', 'art', 'least', 'being', 'given', 'respect', 'time', 'effort', 'make', 'available', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Hitchcock', 'lesser', 'known', 'films', 'Colours', 'Stop', 'Colours']",N/A

66565,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,0783235690,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[1, 1]","While not exactly a masterpiece, Marnie is certainly interesting. For admirers and scholars of Alfred Hitchcock, Marnie has always been a troubled production. Trashed by critics when it first appeared in 1964, the film has since split Hitchcock lovers down the middle, with many declaring that it is largely ill-conceived, overly simplistic, or just plain melodramatic. However, in recent years, another group of Hitch admirers consider it one of his greatest masterpieces, a film that rejects much of the literal filmmaking Hitchcock relied upon for the majority of his career and reaches back to his earliest days behind the camera. But no matter what the critical consensus may be from year to year, there is a certain finality about Marnie. This was the last film to feature a true ""Hitchcock blonde"" in the lead. It was Hitchcock's last collaboration with legendary composer Bernard Hermann, whose florid compositions put a stamp on numerous Hitch classics. It was Hitchcock's last film with Tippi Hedren, whom he had a falling out with during filming when she rejected his advances. And after Marnie, Hitchcock only made four more films, which, while all enjoyable, did not have the impact his earlier work did.Tippi Hedren plays Marnie, a compulsive liar and thief with a disdain toward men. She uses her looks to gain the confidence of her employers, robs them, and changes her identity. Her only loves are her horse and her mother, although she has problems with the latter relationship. Marnie applies for a job at Mark Rutland's Philadelphia publishing company. Mark recognizes her since he is a client of her last employer, but instead of turning her in, he decides to marry her and help her overcome her need to steal. What results is a very complicated relationship, which unfolds slowly but surely.Marnie is a gorgeous film with a great cast. It is true Hitchock in style and story, but far from his best work, as interesting as it is to watch. My complaints with Marnie is that the film is overlong, and therefore a bit tedious, and some of the editing is very amateurish, fading out before the scene should be over. This gets bothersome and annoying. Also, toward the end when the mystery is revealed, things seem to unfold without any buildup or anticipation, therefore it seems the story was trying to wrap itself up, and while suspenseful, it doesn't seem to work as well as it should.I did enjoy Marnie though, partly because of the truly complex heroine and the mystery haunting her, and it isn't quite as bad as people like to make it out to be. It isn't the best Hitchcock, but even secondary Hitchcock is better than most films from other directors.

I think the role was just beyond her range as an actress.  What could've been a great psychological thriller deteriorated into high melodrama.  Tippi isn't only to blame.  I thought the dialogue was unlikely and in some scenes, ridiculous.  I'll admit Sean Connery pulled his character off pretty well, even though he had a lot of bad lines to deliver too.The movie is interesting from a psychological perspective.  Hitchcock seems to suggest some sort of horribly abusive sexual relationship between mother and daughter.  There is also the bit about Tippi Hedren freaking out whever she sees the color red.  Reminiscent of the raking lines that upset Gregory Peck so much in Spellbound.  I can't help but wonder if Armistead Maupin borrowed from Hitch (as he admitted to doing for the Tales of the City miniseries) when he wrote More Tales of the City, as a character there has a bad reaction to roses.Also lots of unintended humor.  I guess it's a sign of the times that Sean Connery asks his secretary (Tippi) to work alone with him on a Saturday.  So naturally she agrees and then he kisses her when they are alone in his office.

Still the robbery sequence generates some real suspense,  and Bernard Herrmann's score does a better job at suggesting the heroine's  turmoil and despair than Hedren ever could.  Sean Connery did what he was  told competently enough, but what he was asked to do was so unpleasant that  I'd rather not discuss it.And then there is the small miracle of Louise  Latham's performance as Hedren's mother.  She has only three or four  scenes, but she sketches an entire history between mother and daughter with  her face and voice.  And along with that, the deep-sesated pain of her own  life, the consolations of religion, and the woman's hard-won diginity and  unspoken tenderness (expressed mostly in her realtionship with the daughter  of her next-door neighbor--a relationship that angers her daughter).

The documentary (like the last few Hitchcock DVD's that have been released) is thorough and interesting.  Universal is doing such a good job with these  titles.MARNIE, the film, is a mixed bag.  I like the previous reviewer  who refered to it as &quot;Vertigo's little sister&quot;.  The script is a  bit heavy-handed with its psychoanalysis of Marnie.  In this age of serial  killers, we're all more sophisticated these days when it comes to childhood  trauma and psychological quirks.  However, Hitchcock uses such style that I  quickly forgive this shortcoming.It's interesting that the documentary  raises the point that MARNIE was made in an interim period, when audiences  knew, for example, what Paris looked like, so it was no longer possible for  studios to get away with a &quot;stylized&quot; Paris.  The film is filled  with instances like this: the stylized Baltimore street with the huge  painted shipyard backdrop; Marnie galloping on her horse; and the  aristocratic society that Hitch portrays.  I find these elements kind of  fun.  I don't look to Hitchcock for realism -- I enjoy the glorious fantasy  worlds he films.  But MARNIE does push the limits sometimes.

In my opinion, it definitely ranks with Vertigo (1958) as one of his most psychological films and I believe that is also one of the reasons why both films were not accepted at the time of their release. Audiences seemed to prefer more suspense Hitchcock along the lines of Rear Window (1954) or North By Northwest (1959) and while I love both of those films, to call Hitchcock only &#34;The Master Of Suspense&#34; is a reason to not respect and appreciate him as a serious artist who told stories about characters which he certainly was wonderful at, Shadow Of A Doubt (1943) is another good example of this I think. Marnie is one of his most interesting and expressionist films, at least of his ones post Psycho (1960). I find it haunting and extraordinary through out, even if not as perfect as Vertigo. It was the last film he made with his longtime crew, some of who passed away shortly after filming and Bernard Hermann's score for Torn Curtain (1966) being rejected. He did make two more good films after Marnie, the nasty and disturbing Frenzy (1972) and the enjoyable Family Plot (1976) but Marnie is another good example of how Hitchcock was ahead of the audiences of the times.

Again, the plot centers on a tortured person, his/her mysterious hidden past, and the unlucky person who falls in love with him/her and tries to find out what caused their psychosis.However, Marnie is a different sort of mystery.  Spellbound was endearing in its &quot;wholesome&quot; quality, with Ingrid Bergman valiantly trying to psychoanalyze the man she falls in love with to try to disprove accusations of him being a murderer.  Marnie's plot almost seems forced to be intentionally mysterious.You immediately are aware that Marnie (actually played VERY well by Tippi Hedren, formerly of The Birds) has some serious mother issues.  She is constantly trying to please her by buying her nice things but never seeming to make her happy.  Unfortunately, her mother doesn't know she gets the money to buy these things by embezzling them from various companies under various aliases.Sean Connery steps in as the one who is going to stop this behavior and get to the root of her neurosis.  His role is gallant and all, but it is somewhat degrading how he treats Marnie.  He finally gets her to admit to her problems by basically treating her like an untamed beast (a real hobby he mentions in the movie).When you finally get to the ending, you end up saying to yourself &quot;OK, saw THAT coming a MILE away&quot;.

The formal old-hat textbook-psychology, that worked so well in Psycho and Vertigo, makes you laugh out loud, when Sean Connery plays mindgames with Marnie. His fascination with the troubled woman is admittedly fascinating. He's a former zoologist, set on taming the shrew, but this kind of strange love is depicted far better in Vertigo. Hitchcock is obviously tired. Instead of throwing bewildered seagulls on his beloved star, he just throws her career down the drain with this one.",1,Embarrassing,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,734,"['Hitchcock', 'course', 'one', 'great', 'directors', 'moviemaking', 'Marnie', 'just', 'embarrassing', 'Nothing', 'direction', 'uninspired', 'mechanical', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'unbearable', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'crush', 'participation', 'formal', 'old-hat', 'textbook-psychology', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'Psycho', 'Vertigo', 'loud', 'when', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'mindgames', 'Marnie', 'fascination', 'troubled', 'woman', 'admittedly', 'fascinating', 'former', 'zoologist', 'set', 'taming', 'shrew', 'kind', 'strange', 'love', 'depicted', 'far', 'better', 'Vertigo', 'Hitchcock', 'obviously', 'tired', 'Instead', 'throwing', 'bewildered', 'seagulls', 'beloved', 'star', 'just', 'career', 'down', 'drain', 'one']",N/A

I think the music lent a great deal to the psychological aspects revealed in the story.

66574,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,0783235690,M. Oleson,"[4, 4]","Prior to Alfred Hitchcock making ""The Birds,"" he was in the early stages of casting ""Marnie.""  His go-to girl, Grace Kelly, had tentatively agreed to play the role of Marnie Edgar, a beautiful woman who's also a pathological liar and kleptomaniac.  The newly married princess thought better of continuing her film career and resigned herself to serving the residents of Monaco.  Hitchcock went on to make ""The Birds"" with newcomer Tippi Hedren in the lead female role.  After a reported unsettling relationship between Hedren and Hitchcock, it must have been a surprise to see her cast as the lead in ""Marnie.""  Her co-star was none other than Sean Connery, fresh off his success as James Bond in ""Dr. No.""Marnie, using a variety of pseudo names, manages to rob a succession of financial firms once hired on as an office assistant.  In the last case, one of the firm's biggest clients is Mark Rutland (Connery) who meets her later working for his own company.  He catches Marnie stealing and blackmails her into marrying him.  Either that or he'll go to the police.  Say what?Rutland was a budding zoologist before taking over his father's business empire, and suggests he may himself be a bit off-kilter going after a woman who has clearly rejected him.  In fact, she makes it known that she rejects all men.  So what's going on here?  Marnie goes into hysterics or a catatonic state when lightning strikes or when she is confronted by anything with the color red.  Or God forbid, she is touched by a man.  Instead of accepting the rejection, Rutland seems even more anxious to ""fix"" Marnie.  What a guy.In one of the more controversial scenes, hubby and wife are on their honeymoon cruise and Marnie recoils whenever Mark approaches her for some sexual favors.  He resists for a while and even promises not to touch her.  Screenwriter Evan Hunter was uncomfortable with the idea that Mark would rape Marnie.  His point being that would turn off the audience, especially women.  When he wrote an alternate scene, Hitchcock fired him and hire a woman from Dallas, Jay Presson Allen to write the scene and finish the script.  In an interview in one of the extras, she said she didn't see anything wrong with it.  To her it wasn't really rape.  Frankly, I was a bit confused myself after watching the movie the first time.  A second viewing reveals that Mark had every intention of having sex, fed up with Marnie's frigidity.  But before anything happens beyond dropping her robe, Marnie goes into one of those trances... fade out.  The next morning, Mark wakes up in his bed but she isn't in hers.  Remember this is 1964, so filmmakers had to resort to implication and inference but others can judge the ""rape scene.""The film has problems to be sure.  From a technical standpoint, the sets where appropriately indoors, are very good.  Outdoors they are conspicuously bad.  Take for example the repeated scene in Baltimore where Marnie's emotionally distant mother (excellent Louise Latham) lives.  She's in a row apartment building on a street that heads into the harbor.  The large freighter in the background is the same ship and it never moves in spite of large time gaps between scenes at that location.  This backdrop was obviously painted.  There are other outdoor scenes, especially those at the Rutland compound that are flush with fakery.  During a fox hunt we see Marnie atop her favorite horse which during riding close-ups you can see the fake horse being used.  There are other shots, ostensibly city exteriors, which are painted backdrops.Both Ms. Hedren and Connery perform their roles admirably and eventually the cause of Marnie's psychological disorder is discovered.  Watch for a young Bruce Dern in a critical flashback scene during the final act.  Also watch for Mariette Hartley, who is constantly on TV these days, as a secretary in Rutland's firm.  Another noteworthy change from Winston Graham's novel, is that only Rutland pursues Marnie's charms or lack thereof.  In the book, there were two men in competition.  In the movie, the competition was for Mark Rutland.  Marnie and Rutland's dead wife's sister played by beautiful Diane Baker.  In one of the documentaries, we learn that Hitchcock thought Baker looked a lot like Grace Kelly.  And you know what?  She does, once you get past the dark hair.For my money this is a lesser Hitchcock film.  The story is interesting enough and certainly thought provoking but there are too many technical distractions along the way to put it in the masterpiece category.The Blu ray transfer has some additional, almost unforgiveable problems as well.  It comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The first thing you notice is the film grain.  It's all over the place.  Too heavy in one scene, gone the next. In some cases the grain seems to change sizes all during the same shot.  What the hell?  Was this movie ever properly restored or remastered?  There are several scenes where color fluctuations appear, including black levels.  Frankly, this is one of the poorest transfers I've seen.  The DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (2 channel) fortunately is pretty good.  The dialog is properly clear and unfettered.  In his last Hitchcock film, Bernard Hermann's score comes across nicely.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include an interesting 58 minute documentary which includes extensive comments from Tippi Hedren.  There are some posters, photos and other stills and a trailer.",3,(BLU RAY REVIEW) Technical problems await,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,5492,"['Prior', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'making', 'Birds',

Psycho, to me, is his last true classic.  The later ones - The Birds, Marnie, Torn Curtain, Topaz, Frenzy, Family Plot - are good, but not great.In Marnie, Hitchcock breaks from his normal suspense stories to present a psychological drama about Marnie, a woman who is incapable of love and steals to get what she needs.  A lot of what ails her back traces back to her mother, who like most mothers in Hitchcock movies (never more so than in Psycho) is an unpleasant character.  Sean Connery is a wealthy man who - despite being one of her theft victims - coerces her to marry him; he is intent on healing her, though his methods are a bit questionable.Tippi Hedren does a great job as the disturbed Marnie.  Connery, who made this movie while he was in the middle of his Bond films, has a certain Bond-like cockiness that is sometimes callous and sometimes romantic.Although this is a good movie, it is not great.  This is not so much because the movie has significant flaws, but just because it doesn't have anything really spectacular either.

She goes from job to job, eventually robbing from each of them until she meets Mark Rutland, who instantly falls with her.  However, as he discovers her habit, he is compelled to ""help her"" and save her both from the authorities, and from herself.Marnie says it's a trap, and it is, but what makes this film particularly disturbing is that apparently Sean Connery's Mark is a hero or something.  Using only the worst in Freudian psychobabble and a large desire to get into Marnie's skirt, Mark leads her through traumatizing confrontation and traumatizing confrontation until she finally comes to terms with her own repressed memories... which is, apparently, enough to make her love him and go home to him like the happy little housewife she should be.Because see, apparently Marnie being a criminal is completely a result of her weakness and inability to cope with her mother's history, which is in turn necessary for a MAN to figure out.  And even though she does not love this man (she never does, at any point in this movie, reveal such a love), his saving her is what is required to have her want to go back home with him.  It's disturbing, but not in the good disturbing way like with movies like Requiem for a Dream that are supposed to disturb you away from certain choices, or disturbing like Apocalypse Now which is supposed to paint a gratuitous anti-war picture.  It's disturbing because throughout the movie you keep asking yourself, ""Is Hitchcock really gonna do that?"" and yes, yes he does.  Hitchcock has decided to fully reveal his misogynism.Even beyond that, this movie fails on several levels.  Hitchcock uses two effects that are entirely contradictory: her fear of red, which is represented in much the same way as the psychosis in Vertigo, and the heavy use of red on the set to represent masculinity like he does in many of his films.  But, uh, Hitch: if she's afraid of red so that she literally wigs out over a small amount of spilt red on her blouse, why is she not going into seizures surrounded by all the red in Mark's house?  Oh, and, uh, why is she wearing red lipstick?  Only one moment with the violent reaction to red actually works anyway, and that's the one where she spills the ink because it actually looks like blood, which makes sense.  The rest of it is contrived and unbelievable.And speaking of unbelievable, the entire relationship seems completely impossible.  How a meeting of two characters like the ones portrayed could ever result in an eventual mutuality is beyond me.  It's not just bad chemistry of the actors, it's bad writing.

No director ever played out his psyche in film like Hitchcock. The rape fantasy is central to Marnie.  The criminal female mind, both sensual and man hating in its ambiguity is portrayed in Freudian terms. Visually, Marnie is startling to see and familiar to Hitch's fans.  The backgrounds, for example, Baltimore Harbor and Marnie's childhood street are beautiful, yet unreal in a plastic sense. I noticed this in Vertigo; a place is somehow more beautiful and possibly ominous because of painted device, careful set, or clothing design that we have not seen except for Spielberg in his space visitor films or Spike Lee in his plastic black neighborhoods, so we always feel while we are viewing that the real world is somehow enhanced. Then there's the details, the way the shots are set up.  The camera gradually circles the blonde ice goddess. Give us a close up of the keys in the drawer with the combination and pull back to show the cleaning lady in a split shot with the burglar.  Marnie is a psychological thriller and because it plays Hollywood-Freudian, it slows and is stilted or amateurish. Couch time is pretty much a personal drama difficult for a general audience to care about. For all the tribulations uttered on the shrinks couch, the story is still the thing on film.  Marnie is predictable and slow to unwind.  All the advantages of a slowly unraveling story helped Hitch in Vertigo, but Marnie seems to plod along.

Tippi Henren, somewhat less-than-talented veteran of an earlier Hitch work ""The Birds"" plays Marnie Edgar, an embezzler who is spotted by debonair businessman Mark Rutland (Sean Connery). Mark is suspicious of her but charmed by her as well. Mark's sister-in-law Lil (Diane Baker) who lives with Mark's blind father to help take care of him but tends to play the protective kid sister to Mark as well, starts out suspicious of Marnie as a gold-digger, but over time becomes sympathetic to her. So what does Mark do after he gets the goods on Marnie but propose to her (???). It's a bit of a cliche of mid-20th century cinema for there to be a ""playboy with a heart of gold"". He thinks he can straighten Marnie out by getting to the root of what makes her steal. Without dropping much in the way of spoilers, this film is the only Hitchcock film I can recall with an ending that can bring an ""isn't that sweet"" reaction out of the viewer.One thing sticks out immediately is Connery's Scots/ Brit accent when his father doesn't talk that way. It's kind of like the late Andy Griffith having a hillbilly twang as Sheriff Andy Taylor, while neither Aunt Bee nor Opie talk that way despite being based in the Appalachian town of Mayberry. Or Hoss Cartwright of ""Bonanza"" being the only member of his family who talks like a cowboy. Almost the ""aw come on"" situation of George W Bush having a thicker Texas drawl and more regional mispronunciations than George Senior.

You know, the ones the left nowadays think of as ""uneducated"" and/ or ""inbred""?

What exactly does stealing money and sending it home to mother have to do with feeling threatened by men because of a traumatic incident in childhood?  It's Hitchcock, so the look and production values are solid, and it's definitely watchable.  But the melodrama is a bit over the top and the motivation somewhat implausible at times.  When Marnie is not stealing from office safes, we never see where she goes at night.  This may seem ridiculous and trivial, but without it the film lacks context.  It makes the film feel episodic and disjointed.  And the fears at the end that Marnie might have to pay for her thefts seems somewhat ridiculous, made more so at the very end with Connery telling her that under the circumstances of her trauma, everyone will understand.  (Like, who's going to actually know or trace her misdeeds?)  Nor is it believable that once Connery has reimbursed one of his clients for Marnie's theft, that the client would pursue pressing charges.  And the honeymoon cruise between Connery and Marnie seems forced, disjointed, and not entirely believable.  It's as though -- well, we can't get along because of your hangups. Fade to next scene: well, we can't get along because of your hangups.  Without ever trying very hard to deal in a nuanced way with those hangups (emphasis on nuanced).  (There are a couple of abortive attempts, overdramatized.)  And why wouldn't Marnie simply run away once Connery is on to her deeds?  The script tries to create this claustrophic sense that his knowledge gives him absolute control over her, but her character has been built up as someone who is basically beyond any kind of control.

It's also not as well-done as some of the lighter fare (The Trouble With Harry, To Catch a Thief).  But that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie.  It's a movie that's interesting despite it's flaws, and if you're a big fan of Hitchcock you might find yourself wondering if it would be ranked as a masterpiece had the cast been changed.In the movie Tippi Hedren plays a woman who's made a career out of hustling big companies.  After pulling a big job, she comes to work for a company in Philadelphia that's run by Sean Connery.  He knows she's up to no good, but he allows her to pull off her heist.  In the end, rather than turning her over to the police he chooses to keep her close to him and try to figure her out out by playing amateur psychologist.The plot might seem a bit far-fetched, but it's not more outlandish than Vertigo.  At times the dialog is bad.  But the real problem is the acting, most notably by Tippi Hedren, a former model who was at least adequate in The Birds.  She's completely overmatched in this role and you have to wonder what it would have been like with a better actress, say, Grace Kelly.Still, even with the acting the movie is more than watchable.  It's even enjoyable.  There is still a great deal of suspense and a good twist at the end.  It's really a bold film.

She is however, blackmailed into both by Mark (Sean Connery), a wealthy publisher, who discovers Marni's errants ways.

However, once you allow yourself to overlook this shortcoming, you are rewarded with Hedren's supperb acting performance. It is a great shame that following her refusal to continue working for Hitchhock exclusively, ever possessive of his leading ladies, Hitchhock spitefully and succesfully blocked Hedren from the type of movie career this talented actress so deserved. The film is further noteworthy to any movie buff as the accepted start of decline in the quality of Hitchhock's work (still, it was judged more harshly by the director's contemporaries, then it is today).And yet, as faulty as the technical crafstmanship of the film may have been, I was mesmerized by the on-screen chemistry between Connery and Hedren.

In a way it brings to mind other films - directors like Douglas Sirk come to mind (with his deep psychological probing - even sexual - in 'Written on the Wind').This film is like a text book for mastery in direction. Of all of Hitchcock's films it is perhaps the most intellectually satisfying - and at times we see something almost crazy in Sean Connery's character (as crazed as Scottie in 'Vertigo' - surely this obsession is also taking place in the viewer of the film as well!

66603,A2F7XTL4KHDZME,0783235690,Stephen Reginald,"[20, 22]","One of the great disappointments of Alfred Hitchcock's career was the failure of Marnie to be the commercial and critical success he had hoped it would be.  But some things seem to improve with age, and such is the case with Marnie.  It's hard to figure out why this film wasn't immediately well received, especially when it has so many great Hitchcock elements that were winners in the past.  Marnie (`Tippi' Hedren), is the portrait of a disturbed young woman who because of some, perhaps, childhood trauma cannot establish healthy relationships with men.  Another part of her ""psychosis"" involves her being a thief as well.  After Marnie establishes herself in one job, she robs her employer, changes her look and identity and then moves on to the next.  When Marnie takes a job at Mark Rutland's (Sean Connery) Philadelphia, Pennsylvania publishing house (not his insurance company, as per the Amazon.com reviewer), the pattern begins again.  Only this time, Connery finds himself drawn to Hedren, wanting to help, but at the same time, finding himself falling in love with her.  Connery a student of zoology and human behavior, is intrigued by Hedren's problems and is determined to get to the bottom of her troubles.  (This scenario is almost the reverse of Spellbound, where Ingrid Bergman is determined to find out what is causing Gregory Peck to act the way he does.)  Connery convinces Hedren to marry him as a way of keeping her out of jail for her crimes (and to determine the psychological reason for her present behavior).  That's when the real fun begins.  Marnie is much more disturbed than Connery had originally suspected, but he is even more determined than ever to get her the help she needs.  Marnie has many scenes that are reminiscent of other Hitchcock classics like Vertigo and the aforementioned Spellbound.  When you see Hedren and Connery in the stables at his Philadelphia estate, you can't help but be reminded of Kim Novak and James Stewart in the carriage house scene in Vertigo.  Visually, Marnie is a beautiful film.  With it's wonderful matte backgrounds, the impeccable wardrobe and grooming of all the players, especially Hedren, who is absolutely stunning; Marnie has that definite Hitchcock polish.  The supporting cast is first rate and includes  great turns by Diane Baker as Connery's cynical sister-in-law, Louise Latham as Marnie's mother, Martin Gabel as one of Hedren's robbery victims, and Mariette Hartley as Marnie's coworker at Rutland's.  The role of the complicated heroine would have been challenging for any actress (it was rumored to have been Grace Kelly's comeback picture), so it is quite remarkable that Hedren in only her second film is able to pull it off with great success.  This was not the original reaction when the film was first released, but with time, most critics consider Hedren's performance a winner.  Other Hitchcock touches are the great cinematography, set decoration, and that great Bernard Herrmann score.  And let's not forget Connery's performance, his first ""serious"" role after his James Bond success.  He's every bit the aristocratic Philadelphia Mainliner, yet there's a tenderness and strength that is very appealing.  Marnie, although not the best of Hitchcock, is still a very enjoyable film with much to offer.",4,Spellbound in Reverse!,973641600,"11 8, 2000",2000,3299,"['One', 'great', 'disappointments', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'career', 'was', 'failure', 'Marnie', 'be', 'commercial', 'critical', 'success', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'things', 'seem', 'improve', 'age', 'such', 'case', 'Marnie', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'well', 'received', 'especially', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'Hitchcock', 'elements', 'were', 'winners', 'past', 'Marnie', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'portrait', 'disturbed', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'perhaps', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'can', 'not', 'establish', 'healthy', 'relationships', 'men', 'part', 'psychosis', 'being', 'thief', 'as', 'well', 'Marnie', 'one', 'job', 'robs', 'employer', 'look', 'identity', 'then', 'moves', 'next', 'When', 'Marnie', 'job', 'Mark', 'Rutland', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Philadelphia', 'Pennsylvania', 'publishing', 'house', 'not', 'insurance', 'company', 'Amazon.com', 'reviewer', 'pattern', 'again', 'Only', 'time', 'Connery', 'drawn', 'Hedren', 'wanting', 'help', 'same', 'time', 'finding', 'falling', 'love', 'Connery', 'student', 'zoology', 'human', 'behavior', 'intrigued', 'Hedren', 'problems', 'determined', 'get', 'bottom', 'troubles', 'scenario', 'almost', 'reverse', 'Spellbound', 'where', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'causing', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'act', 'way', 'Connery', 'convinces', 'Hedren', 'marry', 'way', 'keeping', 'out', 'jail', 'crimes', 'determine', 'psychological', 'reason', 'present', 'behavior', 'when', 'real', 'fun', 'Marnie', 'much', 'more', 'disturbed', 'Connery', 'had', 'originally', 'suspected', 'even', 'more', 'determined', 'ever', 'get', 'help', 'Marnie', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'other', 'Hitchcock', 'classics', 'Vertigo', 'aforementioned', 'Spellbound', 'When', 'see', 'Hedren', 'Connery', 'stables', 'Philadelphia', 'estate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'reminded', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'James', 'Stewart', 'carriage', 'house', 'scene', 'Vertigo', 'Visually', 'Marnie', 'beautiful', 'film', 'wonderful', 'matte', 'backgrounds', 'impeccable', 'wardrobe', 'grooming', 'players', 'especially', 'Hedren', 'who', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Marnie', 'definite', 'Hitchcock', 'polish', 'supporting', 'cast', 'first', 'rate', 'great', 'turns', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'Connery', 'cynical', 'sister-in-law', 'Louise', 'Latham', 'Marnie', 'mother', 'Martin', 'Gabel', 'one', 'Hedren', 'robbery', 'victims', 'Mariette', 'Hartley', 'Marnie', 'coworker', 'Rutland', 'role', 'complicated', 'heroine', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'challenging', 'actress', 'was', 'rumored', 'have', 'been', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'comeback', 'picture', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'Hedren', 'only', 'second', 'film', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'great', 'success', 'was', 'not', 'original', 'reaction', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'time', 'most', 'critics', 'consider', 'Hedren', 'performance', 'winner', 'Other', 'Hitchcock', 'touches', 'are', 'great', 'cinematography', 'set', 'decoration', 'great', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'score', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Connery', 'performance', 'first', 'serious', 'role', 'James', 'Bond', 'success', 'bit', 'aristocratic', 'Philadelphia', 'Mainliner', 'yet', 'tenderness', 'strength', 'very', 'appealing', 'Marnie', 'not', 'best', 'Hitchcock', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'much', 'offer']",N/A

Ultimately, this is a fairly earnest film about psychological healing, from an early 1960s perspective. While I wouldn't recommend marriage to someone acting as a therapist as an effective method of helping people who are psychologically scarred, it is well to keep in mind that this is just a Hitchcockian plot element in the story, and is not meant to be taken seriously.I beg to differ with some comments made by the Amazon reviewer, David Chute:""His patient program of investigation and surveillance has a creepy, voyeuristic quality that's pure Hitchcock, but all's lost when it emerges that the root of Marnie's problem is phobic sexual frigidity, induced by a childhood trauma. Luckily, Sean is up to the challenge. As it were. Not even D.H. Lawrence believed as fervently as Hitchcock in the curative properties of sexual release.""Yes, the husband does hire a private investigator in order to obtain more information about Marnie's mysterious past. But he does this to help her and there is nothing creepy or voyeuristic about it. I think Mr. Chute is confusing this movie with other Hitchcock films that ARE creepy and voyeuristic. But as I said, this is not a typical Hitchcock film.It NEVER ""emerges"" that the ""root"" of Marnie's problem is phobic sexual frigidity. Yes, fear and revulsion of sexual intimacy is one of the MANY symptoms of Marnie's ""problem"" (along with other symptoms such as cheating, lying, stealing, self-isolation, nightmares, fear of the color red, fear of thunder and lightning, obsessive desire for her mother's approval), but it is never singled out as the root. Mr. Chute seems partly to understand this, as he writes ""induced by a childhood trauma."" So why does he say ""all is lost"" because of this one sexual symptom? Are all the people who suffer from sexual symptoms due to psychological trauma a subject of humor and derision? Or does Mr. Chute think that this movie is making a joke of it?Then Mr. Chute has to make a cheap, snarky joke about Sean Connery being ""up to the challenge, as it were."" Yes, we get the joke, Mr. Chute. How clever of you. Never in this movie does Sean Connery attempt to ""cure"" Marnie with sex. In fact, he makes a point of not trying to do exactly that, because he understands it will do harm. There is one point that he slips, but it is seen as a serious mistake. Likewise, if Mr. Chute thinks this movie is about ""the curative properties of sexual release,"" all I can say is that he must have watched a different movie. There is nothing like that, which, to be honest, surprised me, because, after all, this is a Hitchcock movie from the early 60s and it does have Sean Connery. For once, Sean Connery does not play the hopelessly inveterate playboy that we've all come to know and love (or hate). :-)I'm not trying to pick on Mr. Chute. But I've seen the same kinds of criticisms from other people, and it's easier to respond to them all in this way.So, you may ask, if I work so hard to defend this movie, why do I give it only 3 stars? In my rating system, a 5-star movie is something that I might want to buy and keep. A 4-star movie is something that I wouldn't mind watching more than once, but subsequent viewings would be for ""free,"" such as a library video or as a rerun on a TV movie channel. A 3-star movie is something that I enjoyed watching once, but probably wouldn't want to watch it again. Which means that if you haven't already seen Marnie, you, too, might enjoy watching it at least one time! There are a few genuinely touching moments in the story. :-)",3,"This movie is not The Birds, or ""for the birds.""",1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,3676,"['not', 'typical', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'what', ""'re"", 'Hitchcock', 'cinematic', 'dramatic', 'touches', 'Ultimately', 'fairly', 'earnest', 'film', 'psychological', 'healing', 'early', '1960s', 'perspective', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'marriage', 'someone', 'acting', 'therapist', 'effective', 'method', 'helping', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'psychologically', 'scarred', 'well', 'keep', 'mind', 'just', 'Hitchcockian', 'plot', 'element', 'story', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously.I', 'beg', 'differ', 'comments', 'made', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'David', 'Chute', 'patient', 'program', 'investigation', 'surveillance', 'creepy', 'voyeuristic', 'quality', 'pure', 'Hitchcock', 'lost', 'when', 'root', 'Marnie', 'problem', 'phobic', 'sexual', 'frigidity', 'induced', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'Luckily', 'Sean', 'up', 'challenge', 'were', 'Not', 'even', 'D.H.', 'Lawrence', 'believed', 'as', 'fervently', 'Hitchcock', 'curative', 'properties', 'sexual', 'release', 'Yes', 'husband', 'hire', 'private', 'investigator', 'order', 'obtain', 'more', 'information', 'Marnie', 'mysterious', 'past', 'help', 'nothing', 'creepy', 'voyeuristic', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Chute', 'confusing', 'movie', 'other', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'ARE', 'creepy', 'voyeuristic', 'said', 'not', 'typical', 'Hitchcock', 'film.It', 'NEVER', 'emerges', 'root', 'Marnie', 'problem', 'phobic', 'sexual', 'frigidity', 'Yes', 'fear', 'revulsion', 'sexual', 'intimacy', 'one', 'MANY', 'symptoms', 'Marnie', 'problem', 'other', 'symptoms', 'such', 'cheating', 'lying', 'stealing', 'self-isolation', 'nightmares', 'fear', 'color', 'red', 'fear', 'thunder', 'lightning', 'obsessive', 'desire', 'mother', 'approval', 'never', 'singled', 'out', 'root', 'Mr.', 'Chute', 'partly', 'understand', 'induced', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'So', 'why', 'say', 'lost', 'one', 'sexual', 'symptom', 'Are', 'people', 'who', 'suffer', 'sexual', 'symptoms', 'due', 'psychological', 'trauma', 'subject', 'humor', 'derision', 'Mr.', 'Chute', 'think', 'movie', 'making', 'joke', 'Then', 'Mr.', 'Chute', 'make', 'cheap', 'snarky', 'joke', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'being', 'up', 'challenge', 'were', 'Yes', 'get', 'joke', 'Mr.', 'Chute', 'How', 'clever', 'Never', 'movie', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'attempt', 'cure', 'Marnie', 'sex', 'fact', 'point', 'not', 'trying', 'do', 'exactly', 'will', 'do', 'harm', 'one', 'point', 'seen', 'serious', 'mistake', 'Likewise', 'Mr.', 'Chute', 'movie', 'curative', 'properties', 'sexual', 'release', 'can', 'say', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'different', 'movie', 'nothing', 'be', 'honest', 'surprised', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'early', '60s', 'have', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'once', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'not', 'play', 'hopelessly', 'inveterate', 'playboy', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'love', 'hate', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'pick', 'Mr.', 'Chute', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'kinds', 'criticisms', 'other', 'people', 'easier', 'respond', 'way.So', 'may', 'ask', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'defend', 'movie', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'rating', 'system', '5-star', 'movie', 'something', 'might', 'want', 'buy', 'keep', '4-star', 'movie', 'something', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'would', 'be', 'free', 'such', 'library', 'video', 'rerun', 'TV', 'movie', 'channel', '3-star', 'movie', 'something', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'once', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'Which', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'Marnie', 'too', 'might', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'least', 'one', 'time', 'are', 'few', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'moments', 'story']",N/A

Peterson,"[1, 5]","Plot: Young woman from rough upbringing goes around using her looks and supposedly men's naivete to get hired in account payable/payroll type jobs so she can learn where they keep the money and how to to steal it. She then buys her mom stuff and keeps her horse. She gets caught. And the guy forces her to marry him to keep quiet as he likes her. Then there is a plot twist at the end that supposedly speaks to all that you have seen, in particular, her behavior.Comments: Boring movie. Wouldn't even have known this was a ""thriller"" ""suspenseful"" movie. . . let alone a Hitchcock one. If you ever wondered how the story lines and talk show themes about how we are all victims of our upbringing and therefore never responsible for anything we do . . . this must be it. It is one of the earliest movies I have seen with such a blatant push for that pyschobabble. Also, first, I must say that this movie has redeemed Tippi Hedren as an actress in my eyes. While she of course was over the top and kinda laughable at the end during the plot twist . . . she did a good job . . . convincing job . . . in the beginning of the movie. She was a joke in The Birds. It was a surprise to see Sean Connery in a non-Bond film. He was as hot as ever. And if I am not mistaken you got to see a young Mariette Hartley as a secretary (odd coincidence or was it that this movie was about psychology given her relationship to one of most famous of psychologists). And I read that the young kid version of Marnie was Melanie Thomas Scott from The Young and the Restless. But other than those tidbits this movie is a sleeper. And the plot as I said was just laughable. And the acting was goofy for the most part. If you ever took a lit crit class you know that one of the easiest way to achieve cheap emotional sentimentality is to have a thunder storm when the climax is being unfolded. This movie lazily did that not once but three times. LOL Also I would say that this movie seemed to be pushing the limits on what was appropriate for back then . . . talking about sex, psychology affecting your marital sex life, Connery ripping Hedren's clothes off, Lil's comments about what a husband and wife do in the bedroom, etc. But then again Psycho was nothing but such a movie . . . the ending where they talk about Bate's clinical diagnosis etc. Weird stuff.",2,boring . . .,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,2336,"['Plot', 'Young', 'woman', 'rough', 'upbringing', 'using', 'looks', 'supposedly', 'men', 'naivete', 'get', 'hired', 'account', 'payable/payroll', 'type', 'jobs', 'can', 'learn', 'where', 'keep', 'money', 'how', 'steal', 'then', 'mom', 'stuff', 'horse', 'caught', 'guy', 'marry', 'keep', 'quiet', 'Then', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'supposedly', 'all', 'have', 'seen', 'particular', 'behavior.Comments', 'Boring', 'movie', 'Would', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'thriller', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'Hitchcock', 'one', 'ever', 'wondered', 'how', 'story', 'lines', 'talk', 'show', 'themes', 'how', 'are', 'victims', 'upbringing', 'therefore', 'never', 'responsible', 'anything', 'do', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'earliest', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'such', 'blatant', 'push', 'pyschobabble', 'Also', 'first', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'redeemed', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'actress', 'eyes', 'course', 'was', 'top', 'kinda', 'laughable', 'end', 'plot', 'twist', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'convincing', 'job', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'joke', 'Birds', 'was', 'surprise', 'see', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'non-Bond', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'hot', 'ever', 'am', 'not', 'mistaken', 'got', 'see', 'young', 'Mariette', 'Hartley', 'secretary', 'odd', 'coincidence', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'psychology', 'given', 'relationship', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'psychologists', 'read', 'young', 'kid', 'version', 'Marnie', 'was', 'Melanie', 'Thomas', 'Scott', 'Young', 'Restless', 'other', 'tidbits', 'movie', 'sleeper', 'plot', 'said', 'was', 'just', 'laughable', 'acting', 'was', 'goofy', 'most', 'part', 'ever', 'took', 'lit', 'crit', 'class', 'know', 'one', 'easiest', 'way', 'achieve', 'cheap', 'emotional', 'sentimentality', 'have', 'thunder', 'storm', 'when', 'climax', 'being', 'unfolded', 'movie', 'lazily', 'did', 'not', 'once', 'three', 'times', 'LOL', 'Also', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'pushing', 'limits', 'was', 'appropriate', 'back', 'then', 'talking', 'sex', 'psychology', 'affecting', 'marital', 'sex', 'life', 'Connery', 'ripping', 'Hedren', 'clothes', 'Lil', 'comments', 'what', 'husband', 'wife', 'do', 'bedroom', 'etc', 'then', 'again', 'Psycho', 'was', 'nothing', 'movie', 'ending', 'where', 'talk', 'Bate', 'clinical', 'diagnosis', 'etc', 'Weird', 'stuff']",N/A

As with the docs on the  other Hitchcock Collection releases, it is very informative and enhances  the viewer's appreciation of the film.  Also included is a 'slide-show' of  production stills, as well as the original theatrical trailer (some of  Hitchcock's trailers are practically short films on their own, this one is  very funny).

66608,A3M2WW0PO34B94,0783235690,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[6, 9]","Alfred Hitchcock is the reason I went to film school. `North By Northwest' is the first film I remember watching on the big screen. It was this film that made me fall in love with the magic of filmmaking. It was this film that made me eagerly seek out all of Hitchcock's films. I have watched most on more than one opportunity, many several times, gladly revisiting the characters, the story, the direction of the film. I use this to illustrate my passion for his films. Hitchcock is a master. As with every Master of a craft, they have periods of great success and periods of trouble. Hitchcock enjoyed enormous success in Britain during the 30's, immigrated to America and started another string of hits with `Rebecca'. In the early 50's, his films stumbled a little, enjoying less than unanimous critical acclaim and audience reaction. The mid 50s through mid 60s mark one of the most remarkable periods any filmmaker has ever enjoyed. `Dial `M' For Murder', `Rear Window', `To Catch A Thief', `The Trouble With Harry', `The Man Who Knew Too Much', `Vertigo', `North By Northwest', `Psycho' and `The Birds'. Quite a run. Billy Wilder is probably the only other director to enjoy quite such a long string of success.`Marnie' marks the beginning of the last stage of Hitchcock's career. A period of varying films, varying in success, tone and style, Hitchcock ended his career with a string of films that would not enjoy great critical or commercial success.I watched `Marnie' again last night. Universal Home Video has just released a restored letterboxed version of the film, including a documentary `The Trouble with `Marnie''. The documentary is very interesting and recounts the story of the film's creation. Hitchcock became interested in the book, and immediately thought about Grace Kelly. Kelly was eager to come out of retirement and wanted to work with Hitchcock. A screenplay was written. Kelly changed her mind. The picture was shelved because Hitch didn't think anyone could play the role of Marnie Edgar convincingly enough. His next project was `The Birds.' He found an actress, the classic Hitchcock type, to star in the film. Tippi Hedren was tall, blond and very icy. The perfect Hitchcock heroine. During the filming of `The Birds', Hitch apparently realized that Hedren could do `Marnie'. He offered her the role. Hitch, according to the documentary, was convinced that American royalty (the rich, landowners) should be played with a British accent. Therefore, he cast Sean Connery as Mark Rutland. Connery, fresh off `Dr. No', his star-making film, joined the cast.A black-haired woman wearing a smart suit, carrying a yellow handbag exits a train station.Mr. Strutt has just been robbed of $10,000. Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), remembers the employee, a beautiful brunette.Marnie Edgar (Tippi Hedren) changes her identity and hair color, switching clothes, dumping the $10,000 in a new suitcase. She pays her crippled mother a visit. She and her mother have a strained relationship, to say the least. Marnie feels the constant need to buy the frigid woman's love; she brings her mother a fur stole, gives her money every month. Yet, her mother lavishes more attention on a little neighborhood girl that she baby-sits.After the emotional visit, Marnie heads for Philadelphia. She takes on a new identity and applies for a job at Rutland Publishing. Mark Rutland spots the beautiful applicant and urges his partner to hire her over the much more qualified applicants. She works very hard and notices that Rutland's partner has the safe combination locked in a drawer. He has terrible memory.Rutland asks her to come in on a Saturday to type up an article that he wrote on `animal behavior'. A lightning storm causes Marnie to become terribly frightened. She seems to have an adverse reaction to lightning and the color red. Mark uses the opportunity to comfort her and steal a kiss. This begins their courtship.Marnie's world begins closing in on her again. On a Friday afternoon, she waits for everyone to rush out of the office and then steals money from the safe.She runs to a small town in Virginia, where she has her horse Forio boarded. She does this after every robbery; Mark tracks her down there. He realized what was happening, replaced the money, and found her. He blackmails her. Marry me or I will turn you over to the authorities. She agrees to marriage and they set off on a South Seas cruise.The honeymoon and marriage and not easy. As Mark and Marnie play a game of sexual cat and mouse, he tries very hard to help her come to terms with her past.Every Hitchcock film is gorgeous to look at. He used great cinematographers that really knew how to get the most out of black and white or color photography. `Marnie' is no exception. The exteriors are beautiful, vibrant and colorful. The interiors are lush and believable. However, Hitchcock's love for set-work is most apparent in `Marnie'. Hitchcock loved control and he used sets whenever possible, to control the action. Whenever Hitch showed actors driving in a car, the actors are sitting in a car on a set; the background is projected behind them. The background in these shots is always a little fuzzier, the movement always a little jerkier. It is difficult to make this seem real. Hitch uses this process a lot in `Marnie' and it serves to date the film considerably. There are extensive sequences of Mark and Marnie driving together, scenes in which they are talking, the background jiggling around behind them. Also, this process is used for close-ups during the many scenes involving horse riding. Tippi Hedren is an animal lover and knows how to ride a horse. Yet, in her close-ups, she is seen against the jiggling, fuzzy background, riding a mechanical horse. The horse is actually more believable than the backgrounds. In most of his other films, he uses this process briefly and quickly. In `Marnie', he uses it a lot, giving the film the appearance that it was shot in the studio.The story of `Marnie' is a strange one. In the trailer, Hitchcock refers to it as a `sex mystery'. This reminds me of an episode of `M*A*S*H'. The doctors want to see a new film called `The Moon Is Blue' because it has been banned for its sexual content. When they finally see the film, they are shocked to see that the actors talk about sex throughout the film. Hitch was a master manipulator. He knew that labeling the film a `sex mystery' would attract many curious people. However, much like `The Moon Is Blue', Mark and Marnie spend most of the film talking about sex. There is a very erotic kiss and a very artfully done scene during the cruise, but little else as far as romance is concerned. Marnie is frigid towards Mark during the honeymoon. She can't bear to have him touch her. Understand, its nothing personal. She can't stand for any man to touch her. Could that have anything to do with her fear of lightning and the color red? Mark soon suspects that it could. He starts to read a few books and starts to practice the psychology he has read about to help her. Some of the subtle (Jay Presson Allen, the screenwriter, I'm being sarcastic) conversations they have are about `animal behavior' and `capturing beasts'. Mark soon reads a book called ""Sexual Aberrations of the Criminal Female"", which naturally gives him all the answers he needs. This leads to a game of free association, and one of my favorite moments in the film. Mark says some words. Marnie, believing she has the upper hand, responds freely, jokingly at first. Soon he says `Black!'. She responds `White'. He says `Red!', pointing his finger at her. Naturally, she begins to break down, crying `White! White', shoving her face into the white curtains in her bedroom. In this day and age, the shocking psychodrama, the `sex mystery', is really dated and detracts from the film.The other problem with `Marnie' is Tippi Hedren. `Marnie' was her second film after `The Birds'. Things must have been looking up. At least she wasn't having pigeons and crows thrown at her face and hair anymore. She simply does not have the acting ability to pull off a role with this emotional, dramatic heft. She has to imbue the character of Marnie Edgar with life. She has to make Marnie believable and we have to care for her. I don't believe she accomplishes this. Her performance has little variance and seems wooden. She is either the cold-blooded thief or the broken-down emotional wreck. Her best scene is the first scene she shares with Louise Latham, who plays her mother. She shows an uncertainty that helps the character and the scene.Sean Connery is good. He is very handsome and does manage to convey that he is concerned for his wife. He also manages to convey the more unwholesome elements of the character in a believable way.There are a couple of Hitchcock trademarks. He makes a cameo early on, turning to face the audience. The robbery of Rutland Publishing is suspenseful and classic Hitchcock. There is a long crane shot at a party. Hitchcock is clearly trying something new here, exploring the psychological aspects of his characters more fully. This shifts the balance unfavorably. His characters spend a lot of time talking, and less time doing. It isn't very successful. When you compare this film against the Holy Trinity from the 50s (I am referring, of course to `Rear Window', `Vertigo' and `North By Northwest'), you can see that he achieves a greater balance of psychological exploration and action.`Marnie' is a Hitchcock film, which means it stands head and shoulders above the rest of the films made. But as a Hitchcock film, it is not as successful as many of his other films. I would definitely recommend that everyone see it, but you will probably have difficulty watching it more than once. That can't be said of `Psycho', `Vertigo' or `North By Northwest'.",4,The Trouble with Marnie,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,9843,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'reason', 'went', 'film', 'school', 'North',

I have seen it casually dismissed with adjectives like ""dreadful"". Others maintain it is an underrated masterpiece. Put me in the latter category. I was drawn to it mostly because it features Sean Connery right smack in between his great Bond roles From Russia With Love and Goldfinger. He was very good in this film, but Tippi Hedren is freaking phenomenal. Her complex, utterly believable performance as a psychologically damaged, frigid young woman powers this great psychodrama. It is tragic that her career was derailed after this film, she had such great talent.I've mostly enjoyed the Hitchcock films I've seen, especially Vertigo, but I'm no Hitch fanboy. All I can say is that it passed my own personal ""great film"" test: I was utterly absorbed in the film, the outside world ceased to exist, and during the denouement, my eyes widened, my breath caught in my throat, and my pulse quickened.

66611,ARFCORBCTKX1J,0783235690,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[8, 19]","Alfred Hitchcock is arguably the greatest director of sound films, if only because he understood, better than any other director, that the essence of directing is to emotionally manipulate the audience through images.Hitchcock films that were originally panned -- most notably &quot;Vertigo&quot; -- have come to be considered classics. Others -- especially &quot;Marnie&quot; -- are still undergoing reevaluation. Besides the quality of the film itself, there's been a lot of debate over Hitchcock's use of rear projection.I don't much care for rear projection. I can spot it a mile off, mostly because the projected image is softer and lower in contrast than the foreground. But there is sometimes no other way to get a shot.John Huston used it well -- almost undetectably -- in &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.&quot; Even &quot;perfectionist&quot; directors such as Stanley Kubrick (&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;) and James Cameron (&quot;Aliens&quot;) use rear projection when the safety of the actors is a concern, or it's the only practical method.It's therefore surprising that Hitchcock has been excoriated for using rear projection in &quot;Marnie&quot;'s hunting scenes. It's well-known that Hitch preferred the control of working in a studio, and his use of process shots is seen as laziness or a lack of commitment.But if you view &quot;Marnie&quot; attentively, you'll see that rear projection is used only in close-ups, where the actors' identities are unambiguous. The longer shots using stunt doubles are filmed on-location.Whether or not Connery and Hedren were experienced riders, Universal would not have let Hitchcock shoot scenes where an accident might maim or kill them. And that's why &quot;Marnie&quot; uses obvious and ugly rear projection.As for the movie itself... Why was &quot;Marnie&quot; made at all? It's largely a pallid rehash of the same plot devices that drove &quot;Spellbound.&quot;The answer is simple -- the rape. Hitchcock had a strong rape fixation, probably caused or exacerbated by his physical unattractiveness.One of Hitch's biographers tells what happened, late in his career, when he was working with a writer to adapt a suspense novel. The principal character has just escaped prison, and Hitchcock insisted on including a scene in which the character raped a woman. The writer refused to do it, and after some arguing, quit the project.&quot;Marnie&quot; has a rape. But it's a man raping his frigid wife -- and you could get away with that in 1964. That one scene is why this passionless, otherwise boring film was made.PS: Bernard Herrmann's score is better than the film deserves. Note that the &quot;Hunting&quot; theme is stolen from a not-well-known British composer.",2,Hitch had only one thing on his mind&#65533;,1074211200,"01 16, 2004",2004,2732,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'director', 'sound', 'films', 'only', 'understood', 'better', 'other', 'director', 'essence', 'directing', 'emotionally', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'images.Hitchcock', 'films', 'were', 'originally', 'panned', 'most', 'notably', 'quot', 'Vertigo', 'quot', 'have', 'come', 'be', 'considered', 'classics', 'Others', 'especially', 'quot', 'Marnie', 'quot', 'are', 'still', 'undergoing', 'reevaluation', 'quality', 'film', 'been', 'lot', 'debate', 'Hitchcock', 'use', 'rear', 'projection.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'rear', 'projection', 'can', 'spot', 'mile', 'off', 'mostly', 'projected', 'image', 'softer', 'lower', 'contrast', 'foreground', 'sometimes', 'other', 'way', 'get', 'shot.John', 'Huston', 'used', 'well', 'almost', 'undetectably', 'quot', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre.', 'quot', 'Even', 'quot', 'perfectionist', 'quot', 'directors', 'such', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'quot', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'quot', 'James', 'Cameron', 'quot', 'Aliens', 'quot', 'use', 'rear', 'projection', 'when', 'safety', 'actors', 'concern', 'only', 'practical', 'method.It', 'therefore', 'surprising', 'Hitchcock', 'been', 'excoriated', 'using', 'rear', 'projection', 'quot', 'Marnie', 'quot', 'hunting', 'scenes', 'well-known', 'Hitch', 'preferred', 'control', 'working', 'studio', 'use', 'process', 'shots', 'seen', 'laziness', 'lack', 'commitment.But', 'view', 'quot', 'Marnie', 'quot', 'attentively', ""'ll"", 'see', 'rear', 'projection', 'used', 'only', 'close-ups', 'where', 'actors', 'identities', 'are', 'unambiguous', 'longer', 'shots', 'using', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'are', 'filmed', 'on-location.Whether', 'not', 'Connery', 'Hedren', 'were', 'experienced', 'riders', 'Universal', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'let', 'Hitchcock', 'shoot', 'scenes', 'where', 'accident', 'might', 'maim', 'kill', 'why', 'quot', 'Marnie', 'quot', 'obvious', 'ugly', 'rear', 'projection.As', 'movie', 'Why', 'was', 'quot', 'Marnie', 'quot', 'made', 'largely', 'pallid', 'rehash', 'same', 'plot', 'devices', 'drove', 'quot', 'Spellbound.', 'quot', 'answer', 'simple', 'rape', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'strong', 'rape', 'fixation', 'probably', 'caused', 'exacerbated', 'physical', 'unattractiveness.One', 'Hitch', 'biographers', 'what', 'happened', 'late', 'career', 'when', 'was', 'working', 'writer', 'adapt', 'suspense', 'novel', 'principal', 'character', 'just', 'escaped', 'prison', 'Hitchcock', 'insisted', 'including', 'scene', 'character', 'raped', 'woman', 'writer', 'refused', 'do', 'arguing', 'quit', 'project.', 'quot', 'Marnie', 'quot', 'rape', 'man', 'raping', 'frigid', 'wife', 'could', 'get', 'away', '1964', 'one', 'scene', 'why', 'passionless', 'otherwise', 'boring', 'film', 'was', 'made.PS', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'score', 'better', 'film', 'deserves', 'Note', 'quot', 'Hunting', 'quot', 'theme', 'stolen', 'not-well-known', 'British', 'composer']",N/A

66613,AP3B615GM191G,0783235690,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","When watching Alfred Hitchcock's ""Marnie"", one gets the sense that there is much more that went on in the novel it was based on, almost as if Hitch made a lot of excises or additions to the original script (I'm not positive on this...only a guess).  As a result, the overall narrative is a bit disjointed in places and sparse in others.  Luckily, the acting and themes in the movie are solid enough to make it a very interesting picture to watch.For a basic plot summary, ""Marnie"" focuses on Marnie Edgar (Tippi Hedron), a compulsive liar/thief who eventually gets caught by Mark Rutland (Sean Connery).  In trying to help Marnie discover why she is so psychologically disturbed, Mark uncovers a secret about Marnie's mother (played by Louise Latham) that must be revealed before any true progress can be made.In terms of overall execution, this film is a little lacking, especially considering the usual Hitchcock standard.  Not until the last 20 minutes or so do you really get 100% sucked into what is transpiring.  Before that, it is a collection of ""fits and starts"".Fortunately, the themes (obsession, childhood trauma, sexual tension, etc.) of ""Marnie"" are fascinating enough to keep you watching without getting bored.  Just when you think that Marnie can't do anything crazier or be any stranger, she usually does just that.Thus, I consider ""Marnie"" a Hitchcock success largely in part due to the source material (i.e. it would be tough to really screw this one up).  For roughly an hour and 45 minutes of the movie, I was set on a three-star rating.
