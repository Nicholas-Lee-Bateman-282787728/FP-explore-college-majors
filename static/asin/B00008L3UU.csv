Przygodzinski,"[0, 0]","Like Joey Coyle, I am what you call a ""Two Streeter"" and without defining what that actually is, you can't possibly tell his story. I had a port number and was working the docks when I was 15 years old. I actually worked in one of the ""gangs"" where one of the Coyle's was foreman and my cousin did the hiring for that gang. One of my younger brothers was in Joey Coyle's class at Bishop Neumann High.  I was not living back there then so my information on the whole event was third hand. I believe the filmmaker missed a huge opportunity to give some meaningful background to the story via more on the life of a dockworker from that particular neighborhood.  Joey's drug addiction was another reality that could have been elaborated on. The drug sub culture in South Philly in those days was a story in itself. I read the book Finder's Keepers a while back and repurchased it along with this movie. I was glad I did. I think Finder's Keepers is a concise account of the events as they actually happened. The ""Drug Addict"" making a druggie's bad decisions is much more to the heart of the events than the ""loveable idiot"" that the movie romanticized. The whole event was fictionalized even adding a ""lost love retrieved"" interest to the story. I think a movie closer to the book may have been a blacker comedy but if some of the neighborhood anecdotes were inserted it would have added a lot of color.  I see where some of the critics here berated the actors.  I think they did a good job considering that they were miscast in those roles. Debi Mazzar seemed to be playing My Cousin Vinny's girlfriend and Marisa Tomei already owned that a year earlier.  Brad Pitt would have made a great Joey Coyle in those days when the movie was made he was still affordable. All in all, the movie was not that bad. Considering it with movies like Get Him to the Greek, Duplex and Date Movie it might have won an Oscar! Buy the movie and remember Joey Coyle as a good guy who got into drugs and could not get away from them. It even ruined his big payday.",3,Viewpoint of an expatriate Second Street guy,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,2041,"['Joey', 'Coyle', 'am', 'what', 'call', 'Two', 'Streeter', 'defining', 'what', 'actually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'tell', 'story', 'had', 'port', 'number', 'was', 'working', 'docks', 'when', 'was', '15', 'years', 'old', 'actually', 'worked', 'one', 'gangs', 'where', 'one', 'Coyle', 'was', 'foreman', 'cousin', 'did', 'hiring', 'gang', 'One', 'younger', 'brothers', 'was', 'Joey', 'Coyle', 'class', 'Bishop', 'Neumann', 'High', 'was', 'not', 'living', 'back', 'there', 'then', 'information', 'whole', 'event', 'was', 'third', 'hand', 'believe', 'filmmaker', 'missed', 'huge', 'opportunity', 'give', 'meaningful', 'background', 'story', 'more', 'life', 'dockworker', 'particular', 'neighborhood', 'Joey', 'drug', 'addiction', 'was', 'reality', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'elaborated', 'drug', 'sub', 'culture', 'South', 'Philly', 'days', 'was', 'story', 'read', 'book', 'Finder', 'Keepers', 'while', 'back', 'repurchased', 'along', 'movie', 'was', 'glad', 'did', 'think', 'Finder', 'Keepers', 'concise', 'account', 'events', 'actually', 'happened', 'Drug', 'Addict', 'making', 'druggie', 'bad', 'decisions', 'much', 'more', 'heart', 'events', 'loveable', 'idiot', 'movie', 'romanticized', 'whole', 'event', 'was', 'fictionalized', 'even', 'adding', 'lost', 'love', 'retrieved', 'interest', 'story', 'think', 'movie', 'closer', 'book', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'blacker', 'comedy', 'neighborhood', 'anecdotes', 'were', 'inserted', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'lot', 'color', 'see', 'where', 'critics', 'here', 'berated', 'actors', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'considering', 'were', 'miscast', 'roles', 'Debi', 'Mazzar', 'seemed', 'be', 'playing', 'My', 'Cousin', 'Vinny', 'girlfriend', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'already', 'owned', 'year', 'earlier', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'Joey', 'Coyle', 'days', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'still', 'affordable', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'Considering', 'movies', 'Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'Duplex', 'Date', 'Movie', 'might', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Buy', 'movie', 'remember', 'Joey', 'Coyle', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'drugs', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'away', 'even', 'ruined', 'big', 'payday']",N/A
744625,A1WNQPTOEREH91,B00008L3UU,Justicried,"[0, 0]",I listened to Joey's story Finders Keepers on a library audio rental a few years ago.  It was much more melancholy than the movie.  The sad thing is that he ended his own life before the movie was released.  He was a goofy young man with a big heart and a drug problem.  I think that explains some of his poor decision making.  If I remember correctly he had voiced his concerns about the movie...he needed the money offered to have it made but it replayed the failures of his life that he didn't seem to be able to get away from.  I liked the movie by itself but when compared to the true story it fell short which is why I gave it a 3.  I think it is better to watch the movie if you haven't read the book and don't know the true story.  I wish the real man could have picked himself up and recovered in as lighthearted a manner as the movie ends.  At the end of the book it talks about the movie but I didn't know it had been released.

Man finds 2 bags of one-hundred dollar bills that have fallen from an armored truck, (total of 1.2 million dollars) and decides to keep the money.  Whereupon he sets about throwing money around, even after a TV newscaster reports that police are looking for anyone who is spending a lot of hundred-dollar-bills. In one scene, he passes out money to strangers on the street.  This mental midget tells practically everyone he knows about his good luck, deals with criminals in an effort to ""launder"" the money, and naturally, criminals being what they are, they cheat him by taking $600,000 in greenbacks and trying to give bags of nickels in return.  Given this character's goal of keeping all the money and living a sumptuous life, there seemed to be nothing too ignorant for him to do in the process of defeating his own purpose.  My advice?

744631,A28NHNVFL3MEZA,B00008L3UU,Wilbert J. Morell,"[0, 0]","Joey Coyle was my 2nd cousin. The book ""Finders Keepers"" was more close to being true than the the Movie ""Money for Nothing"".Joey lived with his mother on Front Street alright, but his older brother Billy and wife Eleanor lived on second street. Also his mom moved in with Joey's sister Ellen and her Husband Charlie O'Brien and his niece Katie O'Brien. Don't remember Billy's kids names.Also they mentioned in the movie that Joey's middle name was John and that was a mistake his middle name was William after his dad. I think the police accidently arrested a Joseph John Coyle for the crime based on some conflict, heck everybody in Kensington in NE Philly and in SE Philly was either called Jimmy or Joey Coyle.Also Joey's natural hair color was light and not dark. He died it dark, not blonde when he took off for NY with his friend.His girl friend was not a marcy, it was some teenager named Linda, who was two timing it. They were both doing drugs and booze.We just thought he gave all the money away to all the poor on the streets, we never knew he was mixed up with the mob, but that is easy to understand if you live in Philly and are on the streets. There used to be hustlers working for the Italian and Irish mobs on every other corner with a bar.Anyway, the movie was just OK, I would not watch it again. The actor playing Joey was way too smart for the role, and did not act like the real goofy Joey.Read the book, if you want a more realistic understanding of what happened. You can read it in a few hours. You can tell the writer was definitely a writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer, what he was not sure of, he left out of the book. The movie may not have portrayed Joey's sister and husband and daughter in the movie for legal reasons.
