211304,A2AVH5HXH2TYWA,6300214184,CADJewellerySkills,"[18, 29]","This movie is one of cinema history's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success. ""Saturday Night Fever"" from a few years before is another example, but that movie could actually stand on its own. Jennifer Beals' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside, I don't think this one could.I understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80's children, and I will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema. The problem is, the movie's plot is a slow-moving, wasted opportunity.Physically, Beals is sexy enough to keep your attention, and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made. But her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character. Come to think of it, the acting all around is a bit weak.But that's not the problem. The movie suffers from two fatal let-downs. The first is the plot itself. Feminism-affirming depictions aside, it's pretty simplistic, unimaginative stuff, even for a dance movie. What's worse is how slow it all moves. The drama sequences in-between dances drag on, straining your patience and sympathy for the character's plights.The other more tragic flaw, since it is a movie about dance, is the cinematography. While it's certainly not the worst cinematography ever, (check out ""the Limey"" next time you want a headache.) the dance sequences look like they've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor. We're supposed to be moved by Beales' character's natural talent, but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits. By the time the final dance scene finally comes along, the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out, bad editing. It almost seems the judges let her into Juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute.Perhaps I'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing. But if it's a movie about dancing, one would think the least they could do is show dancing. Many movies before and after Flashdance managed to get this right (""Saturday Night Fever"" certainly did, to its great success), but maybe nobody told this movie's director.

211305,A38BU9SLS82TGT,6300214184,Celeste M. Harmer,"[2, 3]","I was 15 when this movie came out, and it was the catalyst for a cultural revolution.  It completely changed the music and fashions of the times and truly defined the 80's.  During the summer it was released (summer of '83), you couldn't listen to the radio for more than an hour without hearing ""Maniac"" or the Flashdance theme song at least four times.  All the girls, myself included, emulated Jennifer Beals's style of dress in the movie: cut-up sweatshirt, tight mini skirts, high stiletto heels.  This movie cause an absolute furor!You cannot watch this movie and not want to dance!  I should also mention that it caused a huge fitness craze, with leg-warmer-clad women flocking to the gyms and the aerobics studios in droves.  I suspect it's what encouraged Jane Fonda to churn out all those aerobics videos in the 80's.As much as I adore this movie, it bothers me in the fact that it holds an ambivalent attitude toward women.  On one hand, it empowers women, as evidenced by Alex Owens's (Jennifer Beals) ambition, drive, and independence.  But on the other, it exploits them: Many of the men view women as nothing more than sex objects.  The saddest part comes when Alex's ice-skater friend Jeannie loses all faith in herself after falling during a crucial competition and resorts to working at the local strip club.Its treatment of men is none too just, either.  It sends out the message that wimpy but good-hearted men like Richie Blazik, the cook-cum-stand-up comedian, will always come in last, and sleazeballs like strip-club proprietor Johnny C. always succeed in their evil ways without retribution. To wit: his goon busted Richie in the nose, and it was he, Johnny C., who wheedled Jeannie into stripping at the club.  He even ends up as her man! Go figure!

Long story short: no job, no car, no money when a friend of mine called and said he wanted me to go see &quot;Flashdance,&quot; with him- his treat. After a little coercing, I gave in.Yes, the movie has a typical or predictable plot, but I would not call it weak because of the actors and the memorable characters they created. The viewer is bonded to the characters in this movie- one cares what happens to them. The cinematography in this movie is great, especially the opening credit scenes of Pittsburgh as Alex is riding her bike to work. No, this movie doesn't have &quot;5-star&quot; acting... I think that would have ruined this whole movie. It has, what I would call, &quot;real-life&quot; acting: not that polished and maybe stumbles a bit here and there. It gives this movie its strength, not a weakness.Not only are the musical scenes great, the background musical interludes chosen also help set the feeling in many of the scenes... &quot;Lady, Lady, Lady,&quot; sung by Joe Esposito playing during a tender romantic scene between Alex and her boss, and- my favorite- &quot;I'll Be Here Where The Heart Is,&quot; sung by Kim Carnes played during one of Alex's low-points in the film.The highlight of the film is its finale when Alex is auditioning in front of the Pittsburgh Dance and Conservatory Company's selection committee. I would call it one of the greatest movie moments of all time. I stepped out of the theatre feeling I was walking three feet above the ground back to the car. I have never left another movie sensing that level of enthusiasm, exhilaration, and energy. I made myself a promise at that moment that things would get better... and they did too... in ways I never could have imagined at the time. Thank you, Jennifer Beals, for the motivation and inspiration you gave me at that time in my life!This was one of the most influential movies of the '80's.

However, while I was too young to see the movie, I knew the soundtrack by heart thanks to my older sister.  My mom finally decided I would be allowed to watch the movie when it was aired on NBC in early 1988.  Needless to say I loved it after all the years of waiting.Everyone knows the plot,  welder by day, dancer by night.  Jennifer Beals was an unknown when she made this movie, and the movie transformed her (briefly) into a sensation.  She had a hard time following this film up,  but luckily due to Showtime's The L Word, she is back on top of her game.Flashdance is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination,  if anything, it's some of the worst character development (save Beals' Alex) a movie this big has ever seen.  But all is forgiven when the music comes on.  This movie was made when MTV (when MTV meant music) was beginning to take off... this was in many ways like a series of music videos interspread with story.  From Maniac to Gloria to What A Feeling, this movie emphasised on music in a way unseen except maybe Saturday Night Fever.I have seen Flashdance countless times, and I rushed out to buy the DVD the same week it came out, because I wanted it that badly.I hope Paramount will give us a special edition DVD along the lines of Footloose...

Yet this film has not lost any charm and meaning. The young Alex, an 18 year old girl, is the symbol of this city, an industrial worker during the day and a dancer at night, with a dream : to join the ballet company of the city. Industry producing art. Industrial work producing the dream of art. Alex is a willful young woman who follows the road of her desire, if not ambition, but keeping her ethics pure all along. Pure by looking for love and not pure pleasure. Pure by refusing any favor in her quest and longing for a victory that can be called her own because it owes nothing to anyone and any help from outside herself. Pure because she salvages her friend from becoming a gogo girl in a shady place where dancing is just some kind of dressing for enticing prostitution. Pure because she finds her energy in an old friendship with an old dancer who is encouraging her in getting started and competing for an audition that could open the door to a new artistic life. Pure because she is not soiled by all those who would like to drag her down into the mud of selling her young beauty and art to the gloating eyes of perverse and lustful males. And she can succeed because she never lets her dream die. In life the dream is the almighty sign on the road to epiphany and Alex will meet with this epiphany of hers, the one she has dreamed of for years and she can find only in the energy that comes from her mind and her body, from her unconquerable soul.

You're an 18 year old worker at a steel mill who dances at in a weirdly artsy but still sexualized manner at some club. A club where it's considered funny to let one of the male workers get on stage to practice his stand-up comedy, which consists almost entirely of &#34;stupid Pollack&#34; jokes.So a patron of this schizoid establishment sees you dancing and wants to do more than eye-hump you. Turns out he's your boss though, the owner of the steel mill. So he follows you out and asks you out. You don't want to date the boss though, and leave.Then he does fun things like follow you around in his sports car while you ride home on your bike. Is that stalking? Yes, that's stalking.But he asks you out again. You again say you don't want to date the boss. He says &#34;that's ok, I'll fire you.&#34; Is that sexual harassment? Yes, that's sexual harassment.But it's so sweet that you cave into it. Despite the fact that he's really, really older than you. We don't know how old the steel mill owner is than tough little Alex. But we know that the actor playing the owner is 18 years older than Jennifer Beals, and that Alex is 18 in the movie, so let's say he's twice her age. And her boss. Who threatened to fire her if she didn't provide sexual services. Who followed her around when she said she wasn't interested.I know that many of you have fond memories of this movie, but this is utterly disgusting. It's a heaping pile of male sexism triumphing over female independence, with a side of offensive ethnic jokes.It's no wonder that the director also gave us 9 and a Half Weeks (again a younger woman needs to be taught about sex by an older man who sorta forces her to do things) and Fatal Attraction (spurned woman becomes a psychopathic warning to adulterous men, but more as a message for men to be picky about their adultery than anything else).Let's see, we got Foxes: sexualized teens seeing how far they can go (too far).Indecent Proposal: Robert Redford would like you to pimp out your wife.Lolita: no explanation needed.Unfaithful: like a reverse Fatal Attraction, except the cuckolded husband gets to kill his wife's lover.Other than the WTF?

""A New Yorker""","[8, 9]","Although I've long known, generally speaking, what this movie is about, I never saw it when it came out in 1983, because I was too busy ""living my life"" in the 80's during my preteens. But I just saw it recently, in its entirety, and thought it was pretty decent.I don't know, maybe it's the current sorry state of affairs of the world today that made me want to watch this film, just so I could revisit the ""Happy Days(?)"" of the eighties, when, although the world was also in a sorry state of affairs, at least there was an underlying pretense of hope and glory, a pervasive (albeit childlike) adherence to the belief that wishes DO sometimes come true, miracles CAN happen, and for every ugly frog there IS a beautiful princess waiting to kiss him...Many viewers commented that this film is very dated, but not necessarily bad. It was looked upon as a bit of fluff that was very successful in the box office. So now, it would come across as nostalgic (in the same vein as ""Dirty Dancing""). But the thing I do like about it, is just that. Adrian Lyne perfectly captured the time, a post disco era when Break-dancing and Synth Pop were all the rage - Who could forget the FANTASTIC theme song, sung by Irene Cara (Fame) and composed by Synth Pop genius Giorgio Moroder (""I feel love"" - Donna Summer among many others).So what if Jennifer Beals wasn't a great actress? So what if it wasn't her dancing? (Think one of them was a break dancer from ""The Rock Steady Crew"" - see? All about the era!) she was just a pretty woman who done a harmless bit at the time. If you love movies and music(especially from the 80's), then this is for you. This movie deserves a bit more credit (in my opinion), as it is a movie that can easily be enjoyed.",4,Beals first major role was played excellently (although not flawlessly).,1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,1738,"[""'ve"", 'long', 'known', 'generally', 'speaking', 'what', 'movie', 'never', 'saw', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1983', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'living', 'life', '80', 'preteens', 'just', 'saw', 'recently', 'entirety', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'current', 'sorry', 'state', 'affairs', 'world', 'today', 'made', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'revisit', 'Happy', 'Days', 'eighties', 'when', 'world', 'was', 'also', 'sorry', 'state', 'affairs', 'least', 'was', 'underlying', 'pretense', 'hope', 'glory', 'pervasive', 'childlike', 'adherence', 'belief', 'DO', 'sometimes', 'come', 'true', 'miracles', 'CAN', 'happen', 'ugly', 'frog', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'waiting', 'kiss', 'Many', 'viewers', 'commented', 'film', 'very', 'dated', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'was', 'looked', 'bit', 'fluff', 'was', 'very', 'successful', 'box', 'office', 'So', 'now', 'would', 'come', 'nostalgic', 'same', 'vein', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'thing', 'do', 'just', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'time', 'post', 'disco', 'era', 'when', 'Break-dancing', 'Synth', 'Pop', 'were', 'rage', 'Who', 'could', 'forget', 'FANTASTIC', 'theme', 'song', 'sung', 'Irene', 'Cara', 'Fame', 'composed', 'Synth', 'Pop', 'genius', 'Giorgio', 'Moroder', 'feel', 'love', 'Donna', 'Summer', 'many', 'others', '.So', 'what', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'actress', 'So', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'dancing', 'Think', 'one', 'was', 'break', 'dancer', 'Rock', 'Steady', 'Crew', 'see', 'era', 'was', 'just', 'pretty', 'woman', 'who', 'done', 'harmless', 'bit', 'time', 'love', 'movies', 'music', 'especially', '80', 'then', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'credit', 'opinion', 'movie', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'enjoyed']",Flashdance VHS

Up until this point in her life she has been self-taught, but she realizes that in order to make her dreams come true, she will need to find a way of being accepted into one of the well known (more snooty) dance schools.Since it doesn't look like this will ever happen, she takes a job as a welder by day, and does exotic-type dancing (not stripping) at night.  But her dreams of becoming a ""real"" dancer are never far away.In comes her welding boss - an attractive, older man who finds this young, tough, beautiful girl intriguing.  They begin to date and, as a favor to her, he pulls some strings to get her an interview at the best dance school in the area.When she finds out that the interview was set up by him, she becomes enraged - as she is of the belief that she needs to do it all by herself.  So the question is, will she decide to go through with the interview/assessment anyway?  If she does, will she get in?I won't answer these questions in case you haven't seen this movie yet.Overall, this is a ""teen-type"" drama that still has the power to draw in us 30-somethings - probably because it reminds us of our youth during the 1980's.

I think mainly because it was a Rocky or Karate Kid-type movie. It had an upbeat theme, great music and characters that had nothing and achieved their dreams.Directed by Adrinne Lynn (Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal) the film launched Jennifer Beals ( The Bride, Vampires Kiss ) into stardom over night. Her love interest, played by Michael Nouri ( Captain America, Black Ice ) also had achieved recognition for this film. Even the model/dancer Cynthia Rhodes (Staying Alive, Runaway, Dirty Dancing) went on to achieve great success.The story is simple. As small eats-coast/mid-west town girl has a dream of going to a real ballet school and become a professional dancer. The school is elite, expensive and requires an approval process that included an audition. She is non confident and has little self-esteem.The other thing that makes her feel less adequate is the fact that though by day she work in a welding mill - by night she is a club dancer in a local bar. The odds are against her - and except for her closest friends - no one can think she can make it. Guess what? I leave the rest for you to enjoy. Very positive ad upbeat film about any one can achieve their dreams if the keep on trying and believe in themselves.There are many DVD extra's on it and it would have been nice to hear the cast commentary, or the directors AND the cast (the cast is always more interesting then the directors commentary - unless its Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Billy Crystal, Carl Reiner - former actors turned directors) but they must have not wanted to pay them.

211364,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,6300214184,mirasreviews,"[4, 5]","""Flashdance"" was a landmark film of the 1980s, singlehandedly sparking the fashion trends of off-the-shoulder shirts, legwarmers, and ripped jeans, not to mention fueling the aerobics craze. It was a fun film at the time, but the set-up seems stranger now than it did then: A fresh-faced young woman, Alex (Jennifer Beals), is a welder by day and exotic dancer by night, while she lives in a converted warehouse and dreams of being a ballerina. Alex has saved enough money to support herself if she should join Pittsburgh's dance repertory company, but she's too intimidated to apply. One evening her boss Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri) sees Alex dancing at Mawby's Bar and is enchanted. The beginning of a bumpy romance.I've been revisiting movies of my youth to see if they were really worth remembering. ""Flashdance"" is. There must have been a lot of knock-offs, but I haven't seen anything quite like it since. Much of the film's appeal is in Jennifer Beal's unaffected performance. Alex is so natural that she easily overcomes the hackneyed plot and its various contrivances. Alex is also only 18 years old (and looks it). I haven't seen a film that treated a young person as an adult in 20 years. And, of course, there is the iconic dancing. The dance sequences aren't as technically impressive as I remembered them, but Jeffery Hornaday's jerky choreography creates a strong image. It has an aggression that I haven't seen in a dance movie since.""Flashdance"" is, on one hand, a by-the-numbers combo of a romance and one of those films where the protagonist must find the courage to pursue her or his dreams. But it's a particularly good example. Not only does it create strong visual and auditory images -with its chart-topping, award-winning soundtrack, it's not entirely saccharine. The working class characters seem authentic, and their dreams don't always come true. Produced in 1983, there is a bit of 1970s malaise in the film that prevents it from getting too sweet. That's the kind of thing I noticed in retrospect that was not obvious to me the first time I saw it. So this one is worth a re-viewing.",4,"Visually and Musically Iconic, and Manages to Counterbalance Its Own Clich&eacute;s.",1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,2113,"['Flashdance', 'was', 'landmark', 'film', '1980s', 'singlehandedly', 'sparking', 'fashion', 'trends', 'off-the-shoulder', 'shirts', 'legwarmers', 'ripped', 'jeans', 'not', 'mention', 'fueling', 'aerobics', 'craze', 'was', 'fun', 'film', 'time', 'set-up', 'stranger', 'now', 'did', 'then', 'fresh-faced', 'young', 'woman', 'Alex', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'welder', 'day', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'night', 'converted', 'warehouse', 'dreams', 'being', 'ballerina', 'Alex', 'saved', 'enough', 'money', 'support', 'should', 'join', 'Pittsburgh', 'dance', 'repertory', 'company', 'too', 'intimidated', 'apply', 'One', 'evening', 'boss', 'Nick', 'Hurley', 'Michael', 'Nouri', 'Alex', 'dancing', 'Mawby', 'Bar', 'enchanted', 'beginning', 'bumpy', 'romance.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'revisiting', 'movies', 'youth', 'see', 'were', 'really', 'worth', 'remembering', 'Flashdance', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'knock-offs', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'Much', 'film', 'appeal', 'Jennifer', 'Beal', 'unaffected', 'performance', 'Alex', 'so', 'natural', 'easily', 'hackneyed', 'plot', 'various', 'contrivances', 'Alex', 'also', 'only', '18', 'years', 'old', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'treated', 'young', 'person', 'adult', '20', 'years', 'course', 'iconic', 'dancing', 'dance', 'sequences', 'are', ""n't"", 'technically', 'impressive', 'remembered', 'Jeffery', 'Hornaday', 'jerky', 'choreography', 'strong', 'image', 'aggression', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'dance', 'movie', 'Flashdance', 'one', 'hand', 'by-the-numbers', 'combo', 'romance', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'protagonist', 'must', 'find', 'courage', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'particularly', 'good', 'example', 'Not', 'only', 'create', 'strong', 'visual', 'auditory', 'images', '-with', 'chart-topping', 'award-winning', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'entirely', 'saccharine', 'working', 'class', 'characters', 'seem', 'authentic', 'dreams', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'come', 'true', 'Produced', '1983', 'bit', '1970s', 'malaise', 'film', 'getting', 'too', 'sweet', 'kind', 'thing', 'noticed', 'retrospect', 'was', 'not', 'obvious', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'So', 'one', 're-viewing']",Flashdance VHS

So popular did the music video become that it was just a matter of time before some film studio would utilize its format for its own interests.  Thus, here we have Exhibit A - Adrian Lyne's ""Flashdance.""  As a film, ""Flashdance"" is dismal.  Yet, there is no denying that it did make some notable contributions to the cultural mindset.The story of ""Flashdance"" is as paper-thin as you can get.  Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals) is a welder by day and a quasi-exotic dancer by night.  She enjoys wearing oversized tops while at home and has a thing for her boss Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri).  Alex eventually decides that she wants to move beyond dancing on strobe-lighted stages.  Wanting her dancing to be more artful than being doused by water while sitting on a chair, Alex enrolls in a dance school.  Knowing that the odds of her succeeding as a serious dancer are against her, Alex is plagued by self-doubt but still doggedly pursues her dream in order to provide the needed filler to occupy the time between music video sequences.""Flashdance"" is one of those strange films that deserves to be forgotten but still endures to this day.  It endures not because of its technical craftsmanship or because of its deep philosophical musings.  It endures because of its nostalgia value.  The ""Flashdance"" look ignited a craze that caught many a young woman in its wake.  These young women are now adults who are swept back to their youth every time they think of their zany outfits.  For those not caught up in the fashion craze, the soundtrack from ""Flashdance"" is the catalyst that reminds us of the wild and fun times we had during the Eighties.  Irene Cara's ""Flashdance. . .What A Feeling,"" and to a lesser degree, Michael Sembello's ""Maniac"" are still radio staples to this day and are also frequently heard or mentioned in current film and television productions.  Therefore, ""Flashdance"" remains popular because of its ability to remind us of simpler times.  It is nothing more than a series of music videos connected together by minimalist dialogue but it is a powerful nostalgia mechanism.

(How Alex has managed to acquire exceptional dance AND blowtorch skills by her 18th birthday is never explained.)As Alex ""chases"" her dream (she can't even work up the nerve to take an application to the local dance school from its frosty secretary), things happen. What happens and why is also largely unexplained, but the main sub-plot concerns the blossoming relationship between Alex and the owner of her construction company (who is perhaps twice her age but owns a Porsche). One minute Alex is shy and reluctant to date the boss; the next she's slipping off her bra while asking him if he's ever ""seen"" the music. On a later date, she's seductively sucking crab legs in a chic restaurant when his ex-wife (looking like some lost tsarina in her enormous fur hat) comes out of nowhere and provokes a verbal cat-fight, provoking Alex to reveal her revealing ""tuxedo vest."" And when Alex finds out that her man has used his influence to get her a dance audition at the school, she transforms into a wild-eyed, chain-smoking, trenchcoat-wearing hellion. (There's also a sub-plot about rescuing a friend from the ""bad"" nude dance club--as opposed to the good one where Alex dances--that is little more than melodramatic filler . . . well, there's a lot of filler, and still the movie barely makes 90 minutes.

Every decade has it's own set of readily identifiable images and sounds.For the 1980's, MTV and the arrival of rock videos shocked the world.  On the heels of the `new' art-form, Jennifer Beal starred in Flashdance, a big budget, big hair, big music runaway success.  `Flashdance' follows the dreams of Alex Owens, welder and dancer by night and her driven pursuit of going to dance school.  Noticed by her day boss, Nick Hurley, one night at Mawbys, he takes a special interest in her and a romance develops as soon as she is `fired'.  After finding out her dream, his membership on the Art Council becomes valuable when he pulls a string and she is granted an audition.  Hard work and talent takes her the rest of the way.The story won a Razzy for the worst screenplay, but if it were so insipid, the music and visual dance sequences were genius, easily making up any deficiencies.

When seeing *behind the scenes* type shows about this movie it was clear that this was a difficult project to get finished...with much contoversy.Visually, it was quite different.  The sets are gritty and smokey (too smokey for many execs).  The style is quick and the focus is on the music and the danicing and to a lesser extent the love story between the two very appealing stars (jennifer beals and michael noiri)By day jennifer beals works as a welder and by night she works as a dancer in a seedy club doing amazing dance routines (okay, Marine Jansen does the dance routines).  Her dream is to go to a snooty dance school even tho she has no formal training.  The love story is between her and her boss at the welding job, who is also on the board at the dance conservatory.The movie launced the ripped sweat shirt style.  Debatable as to whether that worked outside the movie...but it did work inside the move.This is really a very good escape.  Its fast paced and fun. The dancing is amazing and you will be hard pressed to tell what is actually Jennifer doing the danicing and what is Ms.  Jansen (In the final scene, which was actually re-written to make it more exciting...  there are actually 3 dancers...Ms Beals, Ms Jansen and a young man who does break dancing.  Its quite an amazing feat of editing.  Its seamless)  What it lacks in writing,  and it is lacking there, it makes up in energy and visual appeal.

I think this movie was more of a trendy film and a cultural statement than a masterpiece. It's about a young woman named Alex who is a steel worker by day and an exotic (non nude) dancer by night. She dreams of becoming a professional dancer one day but has no formal training. A very cool scene is when she goes to the snooty dance school to apply and is wearing dirty work boots among all the elegant dancers and she runs out of the building because she is so intimidated. Alex ends up dating a rich guy, which makes for some clever lines and funny scenes. I think Jennifer Beals is gorgeous in this movie and in great shape! Overall, this is a movie that was great in it's day not because of a huge budget or great acting (though the acting is pretty good) but because it made a huge statement and influenced fashions of the 80's. The message here is: You can do anything you put your mind to and should not be afraid to strive for the things you dream of! I also liked the fact that this was made in a time when strong female characters were just becoming popular. Don't watch this movie if you want something deep and meaningful. This is more of a nostalgic and 'fun' movie for when you want something not-so-serious. The movie has a refreshing innocence about it. I found it to be very inspirational and I thought it had a positive message for women. Honestly, it made me want to cut the collar out of my sweatshirt so it hangs over one shoulder, throw on a pair of spandex and leg-warmers and hit the gym and accomplish some of MY goals! I thought this was a cute movie (even though it's really outdated) and I would watch it again!",4,Way before my time but still pretty cool for an 80's movie!,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,1737,"['80', 'produced', 'corniest', 'movies', 'time', 'must', 'admit', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'trendy', 'film', 'cultural', 'statement', 'masterpiece', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Alex', 'who', 'steel', 'worker', 'day', 'exotic', 'non', 'nude', 'dancer', 'night', 'becoming', 'professional', 'dancer', 'one', 'day', 'formal', 'training', 'very', 'cool', 'scene', 'when', 'snooty', 'dance', 'school', 'apply', 'wearing', 'dirty', 'work', 'boots', 'elegant', 'dancers', 'building', 'so', 'intimidated', 'Alex', 'up', 'dating', 'rich', 'guy', 'clever', 'lines', 'funny', 'scenes', 'think', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'great', 'shape', 'Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'day', 'not', 'huge', 'budget', 'great', 'acting', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'made', 'huge', 'statement', 'influenced', 'fashions', '80', 'message', 'here', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'put', 'mind', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'strive', 'things', 'dream', 'also', 'liked', 'fact', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'when', 'strong', 'female', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'becoming', 'popular', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'want', 'something', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'more', 'nostalgic', 'movie', 'when', 'want', 'something', 'not-so-serious', 'movie', 'refreshing', 'innocence', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'inspirational', 'thought', 'had', 'positive', 'message', 'women', 'Honestly', 'made', 'want', 'cut', 'collar', 'sweatshirt', 'one', 'shoulder', 'throw', 'pair', 'spandex', 'leg-warmers', 'hit', 'gym', 'accomplish', 'MY', 'goals', 'thought', 'was', 'cute', 'movie', 'even', 'really', 'outdated', 'would', 'watch', 'again']",Flashdance VHS

I love the music and all the dance numbers.  My favourite is the dance to Imagination.  It's so 80's and I love the strobe light effect.  If ur in a dark room it totally strobes and trips you out. Flashdance has a wonderful underlying message and that is to go after your dreams, don't give up on urself and believe in the power of dance and music.",5,Dancing In The Dark,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,496,"['first', 'saw', 'Flashdance', 'when', 'was', '13', 'years', 'old', ""'ve"", 'seen', '300', 'times', 'can', 'almost', 'recite', 'whole', 'movie', 'still', 'enjoy', 'day', 'love', 'music', 'dance', 'numbers', 'favourite', 'dance', 'Imagination', 'so', '80', 'love', 'strobe', 'light', 'effect', 'ur', 'dark', 'room', 'totally', 'strobes', 'trips', 'out', 'Flashdance', 'wonderful', 'underlying', 'message', 'go', 'dreams', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'urself', 'believe', 'power', 'dance', 'music']",Flashdance VHS
