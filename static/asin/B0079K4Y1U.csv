1528635,A2YJHWQOGKNKLX,B0079K4Y1U,DVDCRITIC,"[5, 5]","Cinnamon is a heartwarming movie that a family can sit down to, without all the cursing and sex of the new blockbusters that are out now. For all you dog lovers (me included) that look at your dogs as part of the family---you will be able to relate. Cinnamon (a spoiled female Maltese)doesn't want her mommy to fall in love, thinking she won't get as much attention and love. She does everything she can, but then falls in love with the guy and his family herself. The dog has a voice over, and it's cute......bring the popcorn.",5,GREAT FAMILY MOVIE,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,528,"['Cinnamon', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'family', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'cursing', 'sex', 'new', 'blockbusters', 'are', 'out', 'now', 'dog', 'lovers', 'included', 'look', 'dogs', 'part', 'family', '-you', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'Cinnamon', 'spoiled', 'female', 'Maltese', ""n't"", 'want', 'mommy', 'fall', 'love', 'thinking', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'love', 'everything', 'can', 'then', 'love', 'guy', 'family', 'dog', 'voice', 'cute', 'bring', 'popcorn']",Cinnamon

1528637,A2XJWS787GHPQD,B0079K4Y1U,MISS KITTY,"[0, 0]",It was fun to watch but leans more toward older kids.  Precious dog.  It shows that some adults  can really get wrapped up in their pets.  A man and woman meet and are attracted to each other but her dog has other ideas.  As you can see the dog does her own narration in the movie.  I must admit that by the middle of the movie I wanted to put a muzzle on her.  Yapping dogs bother me.  But I'm sure any dog lover would enjoy it.,3,Good Kid movie,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",2014,429,"['was', 'fun', 'watch', 'more', 'older', 'kids', 'Precious', 'dog', 'adults', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'pets', 'man', 'woman', 'meet', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'dog', 'other', 'ideas', 'can', 'see', 'dog', 'own', 'narration', 'movie', 'must', 'admit', 'middle', 'movie', 'wanted', 'put', 'muzzle', 'Yapping', 'dogs', ""'m"", 'sure', 'dog', 'lover', 'would', 'enjoy']",Cinnamon
1528638,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B0079K4Y1U,mk,"[7, 7]","'Cinnamon' aka 'My Dog's Christmas Miracle'(although there's not too much about Christmas here)is a lightweight, corny, predictable romantic comedy(RC) that's actually entertaining.Nuts and bolts of story: a divorced woman and her beloved Cinnamon meet the potential love of her life in widowed architect, Kevin and his son.  There's definite chemistry, but the dog feels threatened at losing her master's attention and goes about disrupting the relationship.One can hear what the animals are thinking.  Cinnamon has an annoying voice that goes with her character, but the dog's cute and our kids liked her.  The more trouble she does the more they like her.  Go figure.The actors are ok with some veterans. Cynthia Gibb(I remember her from 'Youngblood' with Rob Lowe.  Yikes, does that date me!) portrays the somewhat scattered heroine.  Robert Carradine plays an irritating professor.  Leslie-Anne Down has a role as an aunt.It's basically by the numbers, and if you like mindless RC's, like we do from time to time, you'll probably like this one.  There's no language, violence, or sex, well, there's some smooching by the leads that the kids roll their eyes at, and there is some teen dating and mild family issues.Nothing new or outstanding, but then again, it's unusual to get to watch an RC that the kids will sit for.",3,Mild Romantic Comedy with Mischievous Dog,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,1325,"['aka', 'Dog', 'Christmas', 'Miracle', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'Christmas', 'here', 'lightweight', 'corny', 'predictable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'RC', 'actually', 'entertaining.Nuts', 'bolts', 'story', 'divorced', 'woman', 'beloved', 'Cinnamon', 'meet', 'potential', 'love', 'life', 'widowed', 'architect', 'Kevin', 'son', 'definite', 'chemistry', 'dog', 'feels', 'threatened', 'losing', 'master', 'attention', 'disrupting', 'relationship.One', 'can', 'hear', 'what', 'animals', 'are', 'thinking', 'Cinnamon', 'annoying', 'voice', 'character', 'dog', 'cute', 'kids', 'liked', 'more', 'trouble', 'more', 'Go', 'figure.The', 'actors', 'are', 'ok', 'veterans', 'Cynthia', 'Gibb', 'remember', ""'Youngblood"", 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Yikes', 'date', 'somewhat', 'scattered', 'heroine', 'Robert', 'Carradine', 'irritating', 'professor', 'Leslie-Anne', 'Down', 'role', 'aunt.It', 'basically', 'numbers', 'like', 'mindless', 'RC', 'do', 'time', 'time', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'one', 'language', 'violence', 'sex', 'well', 'smooching', 'leads', 'kids', 'roll', 'eyes', 'teen', 'dating', 'mild', 'family', 'issues.Nothing', 'new', 'outstanding', 'then', 'again', 'unusual', 'get', 'watch', 'RC', 'kids', 'will', 'sit']",Cinnamon
