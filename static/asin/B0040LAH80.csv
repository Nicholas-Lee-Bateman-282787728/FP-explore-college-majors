Anyone that has been able to keep the beautiful Shannon Tweed staying with him all these years and brought up two children, both of which actually seem to be pretty smart in their own rights and not be completely spoiled brats like a lot of kids today, kids that don't have one-hundredth of what these two young adults have had growing up.  I applaud Gene and Shannon on raising two beautiful children and even if Gene never marries Shannon, they have made their relationship work throughout the years and I hope they stay together, continuing to pick on each other and their children for many, many years to come.Rock on!",5,You Wanted the Best!

I don't see Paul Stanley (let alone Ace or Peter!) going through this.Another reviewer says ""A LOT of these situations are staged just for the cameras"". YES, I agree... around 95% of all you see!! They are all terrible actors!! When they act ""surprised"" is pathetic! I mean, with cameras all around you there's little room for things to ""happen"". One has to be VERY naive not to realize it all follows a script! For instance, Sophie meets a guy on the street, and you can HEAR what he says, HENCE, he GOT A MICROPHONE before talking to her!! On another chapter she's on a first date with a guy, and you see what's happening in this guy's car, HENCE there's A CAMERA installed in his car. I could give 20 examples per chapter. I've seen TELETUBBIES episodes with more elaborate scripts! Every chapter is more stupid and (hard to believe) than the one before and the plots make you scream ""Gime a break!"" every 2 minutes (how about Shannon becoming a Minister OVERNIGHT to marry a couple she shared 3 sentences with? Yeah, right)The first episode, Sophie's 16th birthday party, was just OBSCENE, a non-stop DEMONstration of the worst showing off. She has lost a big part of the charm she had during the first 3 seasons and now she's acting more childlish than ever!Nick thinks he's sooo cool (man, walk straight up, you are growing a hump!) but he's just a spoiled kid. The worst actor of them all, he's seems unable to look to the camera and NOT giggle. I must recognize, though, that the kid has a great voice.The last episodes of the seasons are (just a little bit) better. And, ironically, the most interesting, funny parts are, by far, those included on the ""bonus footage""I have to add that I paid some (very) big money to be at a KISS Meet & Greet this past summer, and Shannon was EXTREMELY nice, being very polite with the fans and looking prettier in person.

Let me say that right out of the gate.I did start watching this show on A & E.  I enjoy it.I like the family.  Nick & Sophie are refreshing as they are NOT into bad things after learning from their Dad that because you are in rock and roll that the drugs and alcohol do NOT need to be a part of that.I still say A LOT of these situations are staged just for the cameras.The first episode here for Sophie's 16th birthday was both good and staged.  Staged all the get even stuff between her & Nick.  The best part was the taped messages from her grand mothers.Shows are wide screen that is good.No real good extras, just additional footage.And, the DVD makers, A & E or Gene or all of the above so to speak should be ashamed of themselves for releasing both the 4th & 5th season on the same day and to make it worse 12-21-10.

1379486,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B0040LAH80,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[6, 6]","When Gene Simmons premiered his television show Family Jewels back in 2006 I didn't think it would last as long as it did. It was great to see Gene and his family interact together and live their lives, they're really nice people that you actually like (unlike many of what's on reality television). The show has now lasted five seasons, which is an impressive run. The last season that was released on DVD was season 3 and that was back in 2008, two years later seasons 4 and 5 are being released simultaneously on DVD. Personally I couldn't wait to own these seasons on DVD and couldn't quite understand the wait for season 4, I thought maybe A&E; weren't going to release it on DVD. If you think that by a fourth season the show would start to become boring and unwatchable, you're wrong. Season 4 is not the best season but it's a great one and has some excellent episodes. If you're fan of Family Jewels don't pass, the show is as entertaining as it ever was. We see Sophie's grandiose sweet sixteen party, Shannon throws a clue-style party, Gene goes to Nashville to see a promising young unsigned band and much more. The laughs keep coming, the family is as charming as ever and really the show is just fun to watch!One thing that was deceiving about the season 3 DVD was that the roast episode was not complete; you didn't get the whole roast. The season 4 DVD has all of the 19 episodes which is excellent, you don't get much special features but it was to expected and they weren't why I was buying for. 4/5 stars for a show that continues to be fun to watch and is as good as ever.
