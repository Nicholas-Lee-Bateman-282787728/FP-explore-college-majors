I've had the DVD for a few weeks now and my wife & I have watched it over and over, and we absolutely LOVE it. My daughter, who is 31, came up for a visit. I put on Heritage and she, too, was awed by the performance of these guys and their marvelous accompaniment. She has the DVD now, too. My brother, in his mid-60's, also loves the group. When the camera pans across the audience, you see toddlers, teens, middle-age, and older folks, and it is easy to see why: Celtic Thunder's music is wholesome, happy, heart-warming, and their performance is SUPERB from start to finish.But for me, the icing on the cake is more than just their singing ability... it's the genuine affection the guys have for one another and the passionate rendering of every song they sing, straight from the heart.Some have complained of a cheap looking backdrop and of the songs being lip synched. But I just sat back and took in the magnificence of the singing and the entire act, and thoughts of those things never even entered my mind -- the singing ALONE was THAT good.But a warning about the Heritage AUDIO CD: 3 songs that are on the DVD are NOT on the audio CD (Heartland, Irelands's Call, Belfast Polka). I agree with another reviewer that whatever songs are on the DVD should be exactly the songs that are on the audio CD, and vice versa. After all, that's what people expect. If they're going to change the songs, it should be stated plainly on the cover that this has been done, rather than people finding out about it with disappointment AFTER the product arrives.I HIGHLY recommend the Heritage DVD, and in a special way to parents with children from toddlers to teens. That's so their kids can experience excellence in music early in life, and hopefully continue down that path for their musical entertainment. That, intead of the audible trash that's marketed as ""music"" these days.",5,FABULOUS!,1332460800,"03 23, 2012",2012,1958,"['Celtic', 'Thunder', 'Heritage', 'are', 'bright', 'shining', 'light', 'world', 'darkness', ""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'few', 'weeks', 'now', 'wife', 'have', 'watched', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'My', 'daughter', 'who', '31', 'came', 'up', 'visit', 'put', 'Heritage', 'too', 'was', 'awed', 'performance', 'guys', 'marvelous', 'accompaniment', 'DVD', 'now', 'too', 'brother', 'mid-60', 'also', 'group', 'When', 'camera', 'audience', 'see', 'toddlers', 'teens', 'middle-age', 'older', 'folks', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Celtic', 'Thunder', 'music', 'wholesome', 'happy', 'heart-warming', 'performance', 'SUPERB', 'start', 'finish.But', 'icing', 'cake', 'more', 'just', 'singing', 'ability', 'genuine', 'affection', 'guys', 'have', 'one', 'passionate', 'rendering', 'song', 'sing', 'straight', 'heart.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'cheap', 'looking', 'backdrop', 'songs', 'being', 'lip', 'synched', 'just', 'sat', 'back', 'took', 'magnificence', 'singing', 'entire', 'act', 'thoughts', 'things', 'never', 'even', 'entered', 'mind', 'singing', 'ALONE', 'was', 'THAT', 'good.But', 'warning', 'Heritage', 'AUDIO', 'CD', '3', 'songs', 'are', 'DVD', 'are', 'NOT', 'audio', 'CD', 'Heartland', 'Irelands', 'Call', 'Belfast', 'Polka', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'songs', 'are', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'exactly', 'songs', 'are', 'audio', 'CD', 'vice', 'versa', 'what', 'people', 'expect', ""'re"", 'going', 'change', 'songs', 'should', 'be', 'stated', 'plainly', 'cover', 'been', 'done', 'rather', 'people', 'finding', 'out', 'disappointment', 'AFTER', 'product', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'Heritage', 'DVD', 'special', 'way', 'parents', 'children', 'toddlers', 'teens', 'so', 'kids', 'can', 'experience', 'excellence', 'music', 'early', 'life', 'hopefully', 'continue', 'down', 'path', 'musical', 'entertainment', 'intead', 'audible', 'trash', 'marketed', 'music', 'days']",N/A

This is even better than I remembered and the guys' interactions are so much better than you could see from the audience.  The only ""downer"" came when I opened the CD and learned that Paul Byrom will be leaving CT and has been replaced by Emmet Cahill - more about that in my CD review.  Seriously, this DVD gets better and better - you just want to sing and clap your hands on Home From the Sea and A Place in the Choir.  As a finale, it's hard to top Ireland's Call, but ""Place"" is so jolly and fun that it literally lifts you up - especially when Damian takes over with what Phil Coulter calls his ""dark brown voice!""  Neil's ""Noreen"" is hauntingly beautiful - and I'm so glad he shaved off that chin hair/goatee or whatever it was.  The band's ""Belfast Polka"" is so jolly it makes you want to dance in the aisles, and they all look as though they're having a whale of a time - it just shows in their expressions and in the amazing number of instruments they use.When I first wrote this, it was based on what they performed in concert.  While I wasn't by any means disappointed in the concert, seeing it on DVD is even better because you literally have a front-row seat for all the fun - and it's obvious that they all enjoy what they're doing.  It's also nice to watch the people in the audience as the night progresses.  These are the songs that reviewers pining for true Irish music have been asking for, and I assure you nobody will be disappointed.  Once again, we see each of the guys doing their own thing, but it's when they get into the group music and the duets that it pulls at your heartstrings and has you tapping your toes. This time, they've paired Paul and Damian, Ryan and George, and Keith and Neil, and the results are some of the best music they've done thus far.  Be sure you listen to the lyrics - some of them will pull at your heartstrings.Luckily, I am a wee bit Irish, but even if I weren't, I'd claim Celtic Thunder!  Good job guys, I'm lookin' forward to next fall's tour.  Did I hear correctly that there's a ""Storm"" coming?  If so, I can't wait!!!

Rock bottom came with the last show, ""It's Entertainment"" causing me to vow to never watch another Celtic Thunder performance! However, when I heard that their new show ""Heritage"" was to bring them back to their Celtic roots, I decided to have one more look. I have to say this was my favorite of all the shows, even surpassing the original. Gone are the cheesy suits and cheesier dance numbers, gone are the show tune covers that have been done better a million times before, gone is the woman singing Cher tunes... and we have just a bunch of talented men doing their own versions of traditional and a few modern Celtic tunes, and really great, fun versions at that! All I can think is that ""It's Entertainment"" either drew a ton of criticism or brought in very little revenue, probably both, and it was decided to regroup and produce something that highlighted the strengths and talents of these performers.
