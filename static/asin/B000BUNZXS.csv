950352,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000BUNZXS,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 0]","Whoever has seen this film and The Descent can't help but compare the two films. After all they both take place in caves, and monsters in the caves like to eat people. Both films were made the same year and came out the same year. Unfortunately, The Cave cannot match the horror masterpiece that is The Descent. Still, this film won't ruin your day and does offer a good time to just sit back. It's a good popcorn film.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When a team in Romania finds a church with a cave hidden beneath it, the team disappears. Shoot forward thirty years later, and another team excavates it. A team of the world's best divers and cave climbers are assembled to explore this cave that lies two miles underground and is several miles long. At first things seem okay, until one of the group members disappears and the entrance to the cave collapses. Now the team must survive the monsters that inhabit this cave and find a way out before they become dinner.MUSIC: The musical score is well done and it does fit the atmosphere of the film quite well.ACTION: This film is surprisingly violent for a PG-13 film, I'm surprised it's not R-rated. The film can be quite bloody at times with people being eaten. Sure it will never be as gory as The Descent, but it's still bloody. This film has fantastic set pieces that are stunningly beautiful. The designs of the cave that is explored are some of the best set pieces I've seen. I also liked how the creatures were designed and they didn't look like fake CGI. This is where the film shines.ACTING: This area is not so good, and the dialogue isn't any better. The actors weren't exactly bad, but they could have been way better, like how the actresses in The Descent made it seem real and frightening. This is a low point for the film.OVERALL: Rental. It's a decent as a whole, but The Descent would be a much better purchase. This serves as really nothing more than popcorn entertainment in the dark, and it does succeed at being that. It won't ruin your day, but you have better options.THE GOOD: Fantastic set pieces, cool monster designs and creature attacks, and good music.THE BAD: Unoriginal storyline, starts off slow, a lousy ending, and the acting and dialogue isn't that good.",3,A DECENT MONSTER FILM  7 OUT OF 10,1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,2226,"['seen', 'film', 'Descent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'two', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'caves', 'monsters', 'caves', 'eat', 'people', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'same', 'year', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'year', 'Unfortunately', 'Cave', 'can', 'not', 'match', 'horror', 'masterpiece', 'Descent', 'Still', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'day', 'offer', 'good', 'time', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'good', 'popcorn', 'film.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'When', 'team', 'Romania', 'church', 'cave', 'hidden', 'beneath', 'team', 'Shoot', 'forward', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'team', 'team', 'world', 'best', 'divers', 'cave', 'climbers', 'are', 'assembled', 'explore', 'cave', 'two', 'miles', 'underground', 'several', 'miles', 'long', 'first', 'things', 'seem', 'okay', 'one', 'group', 'members', 'disappears', 'entrance', 'cave', 'collapses', 'Now', 'team', 'must', 'survive', 'monsters', 'inhabit', 'cave', 'find', 'way', 'out', 'become', 'dinner.MUSIC', 'musical', 'score', 'well', 'done', 'fit', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'quite', 'well.ACTION', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'violent', 'PG-13', 'film', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'not', 'R-rated', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'bloody', 'times', 'people', 'being', 'eaten', 'Sure', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'as', 'gory', 'Descent', 'still', 'bloody', 'film', 'fantastic', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'designs', 'cave', 'explored', 'are', 'best', 'set', 'pieces', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'creatures', 'were', 'designed', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'fake', 'CGI', 'where', 'film', 'shines.ACTING', 'area', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'better', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'better', 'how', 'actresses', 'Descent', 'made', 'seem', 'real', 'frightening', 'low', 'point', 'film.OVERALL', 'Rental', 'decent', 'whole', 'Descent', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'purchase', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'dark', 'succeed', 'being', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'day', 'have', 'better', 'options.THE', 'GOOD', 'Fantastic', 'set', 'pieces', 'cool', 'monster', 'designs', 'creature', 'attacks', 'good', 'music.THE', 'BAD', 'Unoriginal', 'storyline', 'slow', 'lousy', 'ending', 'acting', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'that', 'good']",N/A
950353,A2BB4DGBRVGKWW,B000BUNZXS,"A Customer ""customer12345657""","[2, 2]","It's slightly above average.A bunch of explorers are trapped after a cave-in, and find themselves being stalked by some kind of large creature.  A survival story that takes place in essentially a tube (underground cave) is bound to be a fairly simple plot, so don't expect too much. But they do work in a couple simple devices beyond the fight for survival.Cliche run-down:- Hot babes... Two of them, but niether are the typical horror ditz or the typical female hero.  The real story are the two brothers, what little story there is.- The one black guy... Doesn't get killed.  We are spared from the questionable trend of ""the black guy always gets killed.""- Gratuitous romance you didn't ask for... Not here.  The setup was ripe for it, with two babes and at least two very outgoing men. But once again, the audience doesn't have to sit through another one of ""those""- Lame attempt to be scientific... Yes.- Greedy corporate guy... Almost, but no.  This ""we still need to make money"" conflict lasts about 5 seconds and is cut short with a rather satisfying exertion of authority, never to be heard of again.- The wise old man... Sort of, but he doesn't play a major part in the plot or make many lame philosophical admonitions (this whole movie is pretty safe from that).  In fact, he doesn't always even offer the best advice.- ""Overview"" pan-out end visual... Two of them!  You know the type of end where the camera pulls back to a view of a large area, often from high altitude, as if you just saw something epic.  A visual replacement for a lack of intellectual grandeur.Low points:- Directing. Some transitions are too quick.  Some scenes where people are backtracking are hard to follow for a few seconds because you don't see recognizable areas when you should.- Questionable science.  Sure it's a monster movie, but like many horror flicks this one tries to explain things a little too much.  They should have trimmed this down a little more like they did with other cliche elements.  It may have been an even better movie if they let the audience figure out the general idea as it became obvious rather than getting too descriptive and pretending it made more sense than it did.High points:- Sets.  Most of it looks real.  More work, or maybe just more brains, went towards the cave than the script or directing.- Action.  It's a fair amount of violence and brutality.  Not the best movie for this, but you won't feel like it was lacking.Monster review:Not bad. It's primarily a mean beast.  It kills with claws, teeth, and general ripping apart.  It's tough, but can be killed with simple objects.  It's powers are mainly physical, in some cases a little too extreme, but no magic or supernatural garbage.  For much of the movie it is given adequate shroud to avoid the anti-climactic over-exposure many monsters suffer from.  Unfortunately it is displayed a little too much in a few scenes at the end.  Alien and Predator are among the very few movies in which a clear closeup of the beast is satisfying and even more terrifying than the suspenseful dark scenes.  The Cave is not.Ending:In order to not give it away, I'll just say there are some unanswered questions but no more than in the rest of the movie. It's pretty clear what happened, but much like the first couple minutes to the movie, the last couple minutes are fast and choppy.",3,Simple monster/horror movie,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,3353,"['slightly', 'average.A', 'bunch', 'explorers', 'are', 'trapped', 'cave-in', 'find', 'being', 'stalked', 'kind', 'large', 'creature', 'survival', 'story', 'place', 'essentially', 'tube', 'underground', 'cave', 'bound', 'be', 'fairly', 'simple', 'plot', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'work', 'couple', 'simple', 'devices', 'fight', 'survival.Cliche', 'run-down', 'Hot', 'babes', 'Two', 'are', 'typical', 'horror', 'ditz', 'typical', 'female', 'hero', 'real', 'story', 'are', 'two', 'brothers', 'what', 'little', 'story', 'is.-', 'one', 'black', 'guy', ""n't"", 'get', 'killed', 'are', 'spared', 'questionable', 'trend', 'black', 'guy', 'always', 'killed', 'Gratuitous', 'romance', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Not', 'here', 'setup', 'was', 'ripe', 'two', 'babes', 'least', 'two', 'very', 'outgoing', 'men', 'once', 'again', 'audience', ""n't"", 'have', 'sit', 'one', 'Lame', 'attempt', 'be', 'scientific', 'Yes.-', 'Greedy', 'corporate', 'guy', 'Almost', 'still', 'need', 'make', 'money', 'conflict', '5', 'seconds', 'cut', 'short', 'rather', 'satisfying', 'exertion', 'authority', 'never', 'be', 'heard', 'again.-', 'wise', 'old', 'man', 'Sort', ""n't"", 'play', 'major', 'part', 'plot', 'make', 'many', 'lame', 'philosophical', 'admonitions', 'whole', 'movie', 'pretty', 'safe', 'fact', ""n't"", 'always', 'even', 'offer', 'best', 'advice.-', 'Overview', 'pan-out', 'end', 'visual', 'Two', 'know', 'type', 'end', 'where', 'camera', 'back', 'view', 'large', 'area', 'often', 'high', 'altitude', 'just', 'saw', 'something', 'epic', 'visual', 'replacement', 'lack', 'intellectual', 'grandeur.Low', 'points', 'Directing', 'transitions', 'are', 'too', 'quick', 'scenes', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'backtracking', 'are', 'hard', 'follow', 'few', 'seconds', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'recognizable', 'areas', 'when', 'should.-', 'Questionable', 'science', 'Sure', 'monster', 'movie', 'many', 'horror', 'flicks', 'one', 'explain', 'things', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'should', 'have', 'trimmed', 'down', 'little', 'more', 'did', 'other', 'cliche', 'elements', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'let', 'audience', 'figure', 'general', 'idea', 'became', 'obvious', 'rather', 'getting', 'too', 'descriptive', 'pretending', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'did.High', 'points', 'Sets', 'Most', 'real', 'More', 'work', 'maybe', 'just', 'more', 'brains', 'went', 'cave', 'script', 'directing.-', 'Action', 'fair', 'amount', 'violence', 'brutality', 'Not', 'best', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'lacking.Monster', 'review', 'Not', 'bad', 'primarily', 'mean', 'beast', 'claws', 'teeth', 'general', 'ripping', 'apart', 'tough', 'can', 'be', 'killed', 'simple', 'objects', 'powers', 'are', 'mainly', 'physical', 'cases', 'little', 'too', 'extreme', 'magic', 'supernatural', 'garbage', 'much', 'movie', 'given', 'adequate', 'shroud', 'avoid', 'anti-climactic', 'over-exposure', 'many', 'monsters', 'suffer', 'displayed', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'few', 'scenes', 'end', 'Alien', 'Predator', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'clear', 'closeup', 'beast', 'satisfying', 'even', 'more', 'terrifying', 'suspenseful', 'dark', 'scenes', 'Cave', 'not.Ending', 'order', 'not', 'give', 'away', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'are', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'more', 'rest', 'movie', 'pretty', 'clear', 'what', 'happened', 'much', 'first', 'couple', 'minutes', 'movie', 'last', 'couple', 'minutes', 'are', 'fast', 'choppy']",N/A

950355,A3P2R1WF7A03V1,B000BUNZXS,"Amazon Customer ""NJ Review Guy""","[1, 3]","This film begins promisingly enough.  We're introduced to a fairly intriguing premise and the whole notion of exploring a gigantic cave with a humongous - over 90 miles long - river could have been compelling.  It should have been compelling.  Too bad it's not.As other reviewers have noted, the cinematography, sets, props and general all around eye candy are fantastic.  The main cave set is a triumph of craftsmanship and Disney should hire the builders to ramp up their park attractions.  But basically this is all the ride you'll get.  Expert camera work, great visuals and a set worthy of an Oscar - if Oscars just for sets were given out.Soon the ""action"" what there is of it, feels forced, and one soon feels claustrophobic.  It's like you're trapped along with these goofs and you start to feel the pressure too, but that's not a good thing.  Basically, like many disposable movies, the characters aren't developed.  Here, they're practically non-existant.  I suspect all work, energy and money went into building that awesome cave set, flying the actors over to Romania and hiring top notch cameramen.  The paper thin screenplay remained strictly an afterthought.I gave 2 stars because of the DVD's ""INTO THE CAVE"" featurette.  This is the real story of cave explorers.

950358,A2DMEQZ2TTGZ34,B000BUNZXS,A. parry,"[5, 6]","""The Cave"" is definitely worth watching!!! MUCH BETTER THAN MANY SUGGEST!!!This is not a complete review of ""The Cave"". I do not feel that this would be necessary, given the 128 plus reviews currently on the Amazon site. I simply wish to correct, some of the incorrect, negative statements offered about this particular film. I had delayed purchasing and watching this film, as a direct result of the very cold reviews written for this movie. I am very glad, that I finally decided to spend the whopping three and a half dollars to place a nice copy of the DVD in the mailbox via Amazon Marketplace. No matter what you have read previously, this film will be far better than you could imagine, if you were to base your expectation from most of the written reviews.""The Cave"" is a ""Science Fiction"" entertainment film, as opposed to a scientifically correct documentary drama. I am absolutely amazed by the luke warm reviews of this movie. This film fulfills the exact purpose which its creators had intended, to deliver visually stunning entertainment for just short of an hour and forty minutes. The acting is much better than most reviewers suggest. The aspects of the explained story which some claim are missing or deficit, simply are not, IF YOU PAY ATTENTION FROM THE BEGINNING (Title Screen) TO END!!!Some suggest that the audience is not given proper explanation as to why the team of investigators has entered the cave in the Carpathian Mountains, Romania in the first place. THIS IS NOT TRUE!!! Toward the beginning of the film, a group of archeologists and historians are uncovering the ruins of an ancient church building which had been created to seal the entrance to this cave system. The ancient symbols and writings suggest that there are hidden secrets within the cave, and there is much mythology and history of people either trying to keep closure on the cave, or trying to unlock its mystery and secrets. The team leader of the archeologists and historians calls in a team of professional cave divers, rock climbers, a medical doctor, scientist, and cameraman to help with the investigation, as the entrance has been reopened to gain access. THE PURPOSE OF THE TEAM ENTERING THE CAVE, was to electronically map as much of the cave system as possible within a twelve day period, and also, to collect material samples along the way. THIS WAS THEIR ORIGINAL PURPOSE!!!The team members do show a clear and detectable let down when the first person ""goes missing"" without a clear explanation as to why. They are visibly torn as to continue with the original mission as planned or to turn back, but they know that they need a clear understanding for what happened to their team member. They show angst and tension, as to whether they should or should not continue with the original sample collecting and mapping process which was suppose to take place over a twelve day duration. The entrance which they had entered collapses by way of a peculiar explosion, and the focus and goal of the entire team changes dramatically from that point forward. Placed in this intense life and death situation of needing to find a safe, alternate exit, the tension and adrenaline of all persons intensifies radically. When people start to die through the process of their quest for a way out of the cave system, the remaining members are working at a constant, quick pace to simply remain living before the elements get the best of them. As in many traumatic events, those directly involved may not show vulnerable emotion or shed tears, until well after the event is over, and they have a chance to decompress and take in what has truly happened. The emotion which is shown during this process is delivered in the form of tension and angst, rather than sensitive tear shedding. When driven by adrenaline to retain life, this is probably more accurate, than sitting on a rock and crying your eyes out. I do not fault the film, or script, for taking this approach.Some suggest that we are not given proper explanation as to the origin of the primary creature causing the grief, once again, THIS IS NOT TRUE!!! I don't wish to give away all of the plot points, and many of the basic elements of the other reviews are correct, however, I do wish to correct some common misunderstandings which some seem to have. ""THE PARASITE"" which the lead scientist(Lena Headey) refers to, was a biological bacterial parasite from the environment of the cave, which was interacting with the tissue of the creature, visibly seen through the lens of a microscope. The creature itself, was not labeled as such, and would have been considered simply a predator animal, whose origin we clearly understand before the conclusion of the film. Also, the team clearly identifies smaller animals which had evolved in the cave system, and which would provide plenty of food for the larger creatures to feed off of. THIS WAS CLEARLY EXPLAINED IN THE MOVIE!!!I will agree with many, that Daniel Dae Kim was under used in the movie, given his talent and on screen presence in other works. However, people should remember what his character's role was within this movie ""The Cave"". He played the role of a cameraman filming their mapping and sample collecting expedition. In keeping in line with the story, his input wasn't vital to the story moving forward to the same degree, that say, the character played by Cole Hauser, Lena Headey, Eddie Cibrian, Morris Chestnut, or Piper Perabo had been. I enjoy Daniel Dae Kim, but the simple reality is, that this particular role did not need to share the same screen time as the rest. FOR THE RECORD, Daniel's character screams during the final four seconds of his last scene, not every time that he is on screen, as some had suggested!!!THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS . . . If you are seeking a nicely paced, action filled, visually stunning, all around enjoyable entertainment film, than you should either view it by rental, buy it for less than renting via Amazon Marketplace, or simply buy it new through Amazon, and add it to your collection. Worthy of more than one viewing!!! The visuals are stunning on a decent quality HDTV using a good upscaling DVD player, and of course, the soundtrack sounds great with a multi channel system on the proper setting.  The given ""PG-13"" rating is extremely appropriate for this movie, nothing in this film would be overly intense for any person 13 or older.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[8, 11]","Thirty years ago a few Romanian military men went looking for the ruins of an old church, hidden amongst the Carpathian mountains. They found the church ...and something very unholy. During an avalanche that miraculously happens upon their arrival at this defunct holy shrine, the men are dropped into a cavern, a cave really. And something insidious is waiting for them.Skip ahead to the present day and we find a group of excavators moving rocks away from the buried church. They discover the cavern beneath it, and within the cavern is a labyrinth underwater tunnel system. Lakes, streams, rivers, and dangerous curves. So they call in the world's foremost cave diving experts to help explore the area.Once inside the cave, the divers patrol its waters and discover strange creatures, like slimy moles, slithering around. But are these things at the top of the food chain down here?As the cave diving crew drops further and further into the cave's depths, members of their team gradually disappear in a most unappetizing fashion. Humans are NOT at the top of the food chain. Not down here.And did one of those creatures have a tattoo on its ...um ...whatever that is? Is that the same tattoo we saw on one of the Romanian soldiers thirty years ago?______________________________________________________________________________It's just too easy to bash the hell outta this film, so I will. Ready?First, the characters. I didn't know nor care about any of these putz's. Cole Hauser (who starred in PITCH BLACK) plays Jack, the leader of the dive team, and it is he who first finds the larger man-eaters that live beneath the surface. But his character - indeed all of the characters - are so underdeveloped that you might cheer as they get killed off.Second, the plot. Exactly what was it? Was it about a creature trying to escape its cavernous cage (as the ending suggests)? Or was it a kill-off style film in the vein of ALIEN, ALIENS, and PITCH BLACK? I'm not sure.Third, the creatures. An obvious steal from the aforementioned ALIEN and PITCH BLACK (big jawed teeth like ALIEN and the sonar capabilities from PITCH BLACK).Fourth, the science. It take eons for evolutionary changes in any species, but the makers of this film would have you believe that it could happen via a parasite in a matter of hours or days. Come on!The only (partial) saving grace for this movie was the underwater camera work. The caves were beautiful and shot in high definition.

The fact that ""Relic"" is unfairly trashed so very frequently leaves me scratching my head in utter disbelief. I barely managed to finish sitting through ""The Cave"" this very evening, and it makes me cherish my memories of ""Relic"" all the more. You want bottom-of-the-barrel bad? Look no further, friends, because ""The Cave"" will not disappoint! This, quite honestly, makes anything by Uwe Boll seem like Shakespeare!A vast underground cavern, nestled deep within the rocky nooks of the Carpathian Mountains, serves as our main point of focus. We, the viewers, are expected to believe that a group of cave-divers that do nothing but whine and fight have been working together for years on end! If you can get past that hilarity, you then have to contend with a script that meanders and drags for an excruciating eternity before you ever get to see anything of real interest. The action is all quick-cut and very hard to follow, meaning you never really get a good enough look at the monsters or the carnage they bring to our heroes. About the only real merit I can give this effort is the set design. That, I must say here and now, is nothing short of outstanding.

The Cave is nothing like The Descent, only that they both take place in the dark underground. Now, that doesn't make The Cave equal to bat guano, its more like a distant cousin of a better movie. We have a hodgepodge of cave explorers (token black guy, beautiful foreign woman, the girl next door, the handsome rebel, the fearless leader, the old scientist and the other monster fodder that's usually backing them up) The story is familiar, uncharted caves that in the beginning thanks to flashbacks show an ominous presence and make us realize these caves aren't inhabited by just blind albino fish and a Gollum or two.Bring in the main cast, who are there to stake their claim and map out these unknown systems in the Carpathian Mountains, they have tons of high tech equipment, fancied up re-breathers, cameras, and tight outfits. There is plenty of testosterone, mostly in the form of Cole Hauser as Jack, Eddie Cibrian as Jacks brother Tyler, and Morris Chestnut as Top. The girls who are secondary at best are played by Lena Headley as Kathryn and Piper Perabo as Charlie. The others are just forgettable, although we do have Daniel Dae Kim as the photographer Alex and I only know him because he is on the TV show Lost.Basically, it's formulaic, there is curiosity, risk, triumph, confusion, fear, more confusion, discussion, planning, the ""aha"" moment, decisions, and then calm, mix in a lot of death and daring and water and they had a movie. The monster in this, a mutated human being infected with a parasite (of course) wasn't that frightening to me, maybe because it was a rip off of other movie monsters. It had the stealth and camouflage of Alien, they even shot some of the frames exactly like Aliens (it backing up slowly, close up of the mouth, snatching from the ceiling crawling into a space in the wall) It had vision effects like Predator, the scene where they all slide down a waterfall was very much like the Goonies except with broken bones and no pirate ship (although pirates would have been sweet).

950371,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000BUNZXS,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 0]","There's a deep underwater cave in Romania, begging to be explored, and the only people capable for the job are men with five-o-clock shadows and the girl from ""Coyote Ugly"".  It's easy to know the film is not making a good impression when it begins in the past with a bunch of scavengers getting stuck in a cave and nothing else happens.  That's my overall mood with ""The Cave"": nothing.  Only after I saw it that I clipped my toenails with such thrill did I realize just how bored I was with this movie.Whereas ""The Descent"" was masterfully made for a cavernous horror, this movie does everything it can to be the complete opposite. ""Descent"" had identifiable side characters and a tragic lead, all incapable of defending themselves; this movie had a pick-n-mix of one-dimensional stereotypes who do mindless action stuff and deliver wooden dialogue straight out of a ""Resident Evil"" game, only without the unintentional humor.  ""Descent"" had a gloomy dark environment, visibly shy to enhance the intensity; this movie did the same, but decided to add the shakey-cam for nausea instead of fear.  ""Descent"" relied strongly on ambient sound so the audience won't expect imminent scares; this movie keeps blasting the shocking music for the entire movie, diffusing any real suspense.  ""Descent"" has the characters go on a trip to cheer up a grief-striken character after an unfortunate event, leading into a psychological process of said character's self-endurance; the characters in this movie are on a mission to inflate their ego and waving their crotch at each other.  You can tell what movie I'm recommending instead.Here's the thing: there's nothing technically wrong with ""The Cave"", but what's there to be have?  The film is simply built on requirements: it REQUIRES to have someone flirt with the leading lady; it REQUIRES to have two people fighting each other over a dispute during a prevailing crisis; it REQUIRES for someone to question and point out ever single disturbance that's happening; it REQUIRES someone to save a victim from being dragged by the monster, only for the monster to quickly drag it into the darkness.  The film didn't break any new grounds or push the existing elements into interesting directions, just another fluff to be added to the Syfy channel.

950380,ANCNEU3MD7RR,B000BUNZXS,FizzWiz,"[5, 6]","The idea of being in a cave was a great idea, and this movie shows caves in such beautiful landscapes with sparkling stalagmites and stalagtites, and all the different lighting effects on water and various places of rock formations was so placed to make it seem so real, and yet very viewable.You need a lot of patience to be able to watch this movie as it is very dark, and it should be dark.  If there is anyone who loved the movie Cube, they might actually like this movie a bit too.  If it wasn't for many of the questionable or blatant foul-ups of the realism of the story, many more people would have liked this movie.What attracts people to this movie is the action, but most people who like action movies don't like this one, as the action is just a random mixture of someone {almost?- you have to watch to find out) getting eaten up as in other action movies like The Chronicles of Riddick.  Someone who likes movies with more drama may not have been interested in watching this one because it may seem more like an action movie only.  If they somehow added more drama and focused less on the action, maybe it could have been more successful, but it's easier to say than to actually make it, espeically after the fact.The plot line for this movie does work in the sense that they think of different possibilities of how one could go through the cave.  Though they should have thrown a scene in there which was the same place where ""114"" happened in which the characters recognized that they were there.Hauser plays his character well as there is a goodness but a creepiness to him at the same time.  He has a deep voice and a young look which makes him sound like a mature, experienced adult.  They give his character sci-fi like qualities, but keep it real, but that hurts the movie because they go nowhere with it and may as well have just kept it out to begin with.  The writers give him these characteristics to show the audience why he acts the way he does throughout the movie, but this nuance doesn't work for an interesting movie even though it's a tiny bit different.Rick Ravallo plays Briggs, and he was your standard macho guy act.  With Cibrian's experience in Sunset Beach and other soap opera type shows, and with Hauser, Ravallo, Kim, and Chestnut all fighting over the women, they could overdramatized this into one big soap opera to end up with a different kind of movie which probably would have plopped as well, but been much more sexually intense.  It's also very possible these characters would not have taken on this kind of challenge if the script was written as so, but if there was to be a sequel involving a cave, this might be a good direction to try for.The ending leaves off on a poor note for a possible sequel easily.  It's really bad the way they do it- they may as well have just left it off rather than waste 3-5 more minutes of production.

Now I wonder if they even used any footage from this movie to make that trailer.Watching this movie was like staring into a strobe light.  The whole movie seems to be nothing but flashing bits of images, too dark to make out, too fast to make out, cameras shaking and not being held still.It seems like this is supposed to be another Aliens sequel, the creature looks exactly the same, it lives inside a host body, etc.  Only this is the worst of the Aliens series.  I don't see how anyone could watch the final production and allow it to go to theaters or DVD.  This may actually be the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life, I was trying to think of some that were worse, but can't come up with anything yet.Watching this actually makes you dizzy, and it really is just like looking into a strobe light for 2 hours.  The camera work is horrible, the acting is horrible, there is no story or plot, I can't think of anything good about it.There is also no way a scientific crew fights with each other and acts the way these characters do.  Imagine watching a National Geographic special and everyone including the camera people fight with each other and beat each other up.  Ridiculous.Movie also has no ending.  When they run out of film or budget (or perhaps just got tired of making the film) they just stop the movie and splice on the credits.  Not that the movie had any story line to begin with, so there is no dissapointment that you don't have an ending, since there was no story to end in the first place.  The credits were actually the best part of the movie.  It was still and you could make it out, and you were really happy that it was finally over.The scariest part of this movie is when you realise the possibility that they might make a sequel to this.AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!",1,Worst of the ALIENS sequels,1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,2011,"['saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'theaters', 'trailer', 'people', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'made', 'movie', 'look', 'good', 'Now', 'wonder', 'even', 'used', 'footage', 'movie', 'make', 'trailer.Watching', 'movie', 'was', 'staring', 'strobe', 'light', 'whole', 'movie', 'be', 'nothing', 'flashing', 'bits', 'images', 'too', 'dark', 'make', 'out', 'too', 'fast', 'make', 'out', 'cameras', 'shaking', 'not', 'being', 'held', 'still.It', 'supposed', 'be', 'Aliens', 'sequel', 'creature', 'exactly', 'same', 'host', 'body', 'etc', 'Only', 'worst', 'Aliens', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'watch', 'final', 'production', 'allow', 'go', 'theaters', 'DVD', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'entire', 'life', 'was', 'trying', 'think', 'were', 'worse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'yet.Watching', 'actually', 'dizzy', 'really', 'just', 'like', 'looking', 'strobe', 'light', '2', 'hours', 'camera', 'work', 'horrible', 'acting', 'horrible', 'story', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'good', 'it.There', 'also', 'way', 'scientific', 'crew', 'fights', 'other', 'way', 'characters', 'do', 'Imagine', 'watching', 'National', 'Geographic', 'special', 'everyone', 'including', 'camera', 'people', 'fight', 'other', 'beat', 'other', 'up', 'Ridiculous.Movie', 'also', 'ending', 'When', 'run', 'film', 'budget', 'perhaps', 'just', 'got', 'tired', 'making', 'film', 'just', 'stop', 'movie', 'splice', 'credits', 'Not', 'movie', 'had', 'story', 'line', 'begin', 'dissapointment', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'ending', 'was', 'story', 'end', 'first', 'place', 'credits', 'were', 'actually', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'could', 'make', 'out', 'were', 'really', 'happy', 'was', 'finally', 'over.The', 'scariest', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'realise', 'possibility', 'might', 'make', 'sequel', 'this.AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH']",N/A

950383,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B000BUNZXS,General Breadbasket,"[0, 0]","""The Cave"" is a sci-fi/horror film featuring caves, water, darkness, and some nasty monsters. As far as stories about caves go, it's no ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"". As far as sci-fi/horror films go, it's not exactly John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". Still, it's very well filmed, fine looking movie, and it's entertaining in places. I think it was all right, actually.A group of the world's top scuba and cave divers are summonded to Romania by a certain Dr Nikolai to investigate a fascinating underwater cave system. Little do they know that the ecosystem within is full of strange savage creatures, eager for flesh. Little to do they know that these creatures were once like themselves? What changed them?The locations are very atmospheric and the underwater filming was really well done, especially considering there was so much of it. The dialogue is fairly b-grade, but I don't really mind that too much, it's kind of funny really. The cave creatures are well designed, but I thought they were a little too much like H.R. Geiger's ""Alien"" creatures for my liking. Went on for a bit towards the end too.Special features on the DVD include two audio commentaries: one from the director, the producer and the effects producer, and the other by the two writers of the film. There's a featurette called ""Designing Evolution"" which goes over the development of the cave creatures, and an 18 minute documentary ""Into the Cave"" which features the two real cave divers who advised the filmmakers of ""The Cave"", discussing. There's a fair bit of underwater cave footage, including some from Antarctica, which was interesting. In this documentary, they talk about the real dangers of cave diving, and though they don't feature monsters, seem pretty scary. I get claustrophobic on a packed train. I don't know how I'd handle being trapped underwater, my oxygen running out slowly...Though I'd never have the courage to go cave diving, I've always thought it was fascinating.

950384,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B000BUNZXS,Ghoulie Guru,"[3, 4]","Here's a crazy thing... Before this movie started on the DVD, they showed the MPAA rating. Next to the PG-13 rating it said: Rated PG-13 for creature violence.Creature violence! How great is that? The MPAA used to just base their ratings on potboiler terms like: violence, nudity, sexual situations. Now they've actually given creature movies their own rating system! I wonder if this was the first movie to be rated for creature violence. I never noticed it before, but I thought it was noteworthy. Anyway...In THE CAVE, a bunch of wacky spelunkers decide to descend into some mysterious caverns and awaken something terrible. It's a fairly standard set-up for a horror movie, but what THE CAVE has going for it is that it combines two different types of creature movie into one.The movie starts off in standard fashion. The story of Ten Little Spelunkers who start disappearing one by one. In the brief glimpses we get of the creature, we are led to believe that it might be some big mutated bat. I know what you're thinking, sounds pretty lame. I was in the middle of rolling my eyes and picking at my navel lint when the movie took an unexpected turn.Okay, now here comes a big spoiler. If you intend on seeing this movie and you want to be surprised, stop reading now. But if you're curious as to why I went from being bored to being pseudo-entertained (and why you might have the same experience) then read on...See, the monster that's prowling around down in the caves is actually a parasite that gradually transforms its host into a monster. The guy who gets bitten/infected is played by an actor that I've seen before but I can't remember his name. He's kind of like the poor man's Tom Berenger. Anyway, he gets infected and starts transforming into something more than human. His fellow spelunkers are all worried about him as his pupils turn all funny and his hearing gets extra sharp. If you remember how that one Marine went all buggy in THE ABYSS, it's kind of like that.In horror movies you usually either have an external enemy, and everyone has to band together to fight this horrible thing. Or the enemy is within, and everyone has to figure out who the killer is inside their little group before they all get sliced and diced. This horror movie has a little bit of both. It's about an external enemy and the enemy within. That's what I liked about it.Luckily for our plucky spelunkers, budget Tom Berenger decides that he's going to go against the creatures that infected him and help his cave-climbing comrades get to safety. It's all fairly reminiscent of PITCH BLACK if Riddick had become infected by one of the creattures. Despite its predictability, THE CAVE winds up being a notch above your basic creature flick.And it's rated PG-13 for CREATURE VIOLENCE!

950392,A2PIX2K56IZZYX,B000BUNZXS,Jason W. Kaiser,"[2, 4]","This movie rocked!!! I was completely taken by surprise with this one. I remember seeing the previews earlier last year and thought it showed some promise, I guess it did rather poorly by way of box office and that's a real shame, alot of people are missin' out on a real fun, exciting movie. I had a top 10 for 2005 already done, but I may have to go back and revise it a bit, and slip this baby in at #10, I enjoyed it that much.I don't think I saw a better looking movie this past year, the sets and locations are amazing. The cave itself is sensational, giant, beautifull but creepy. The work that went into the presentation of the whole underground cave and its depths is really first rate. The special effects are very well done and the photography and picture are excellent, they could have had a disaster shooting this, but the camera-work really comes off sharp and scary.Another surprise was the cast, Cole Hauser plays Jack, leader of a team of professional cave explorers who are hired to go looking for a new ecosystem in this recently discovered cave. Hauser did rather well as the lead, just as he did in his last under-rated and under-appreciated movie, Paparazzi (3.5 stars) His brother Tyler, played by Eddie Cibrian, who I recognized, but just couldn't place (I hate that) is also on the team. The notable stars for the rest of the crew are Morris Chestnut (huge arms, but still not much of an actor) Lena Headey, and Piper Perabo (she of Coyote Ugly fame) I was also impressed with the strong bond they showed between the brothers, although they have a few disagreements here and there,they are there for each other to the bitter end.The team dives 1 mile beneath the surface and comes face to face with some parasite/predator that has thrived in isolation and has a craving for human blood. We get kind of a weak explanation towards the beginning that they mught be ancient demons who protected a church that housed the opening to the great cave. But it really doesn't matter, I'm sure some reviewers might have a problem with the plot-holes, but I was just just having too much fun to care.There is a scene when Piper Perabo is climbing up part of the cave and is confronted by one of our 'creatures'. It is incredible people, the imagery and Piper's fine acting combined to give you a very memorable and scary scene. Now, I have read a couple of reviews and let me tell the rest of you, ignore them, watch this, you will have such a great time. It is both scary and suspensefull, also well acted and directed, with stunning scenery and a plot twist with our leading man Mr. Hauser that I thought was very clever.Any flaws? very few, not really worth mentioning. The end will be  thought of as silly and contrived by many, and I guess I can sort of see why, but it fit for me. Also, a couple of the lesser used memebers of the team are rather bland, but they are not in it much so it's ok. There really have not been many good sci-fi/horror movies in the water since Leviathan, Deep Star Six, and The Abyss, so do yourself a favor, check this one out, you won't be sorry.

950393,A3PGU131J5ULSM,B000BUNZXS,jazzfan,"[3, 3]","The Cave borrows heavily from far better films, primarily from Alien and The Thing but also from Pitch Black. It has some interesting ideas but overall the story is weak and parts of it are ridiculous.As pointed out before, why would a predatory creature 'turn' it's prey into competition for it's own food supply? Also, why would a creature that lives exclusively underground in a big cave that is mostly underwater have wings? And once the survivors learned how sensitive the creatures were to sound, it took a long time for someone to decide to use that against them, and then only in a very perfunctory way.The movie is entertaining enough for a popcorn flick on a boring rainy day (which is how I came to watch it), but it's sub-par in many ways. None of the actors was terrible and they all did as well as you should expect given the problems with the story, the inane dialogue in the script and some very poor special effects.Not to say all of the effects are poor because some of them are very good, but some are so bad I cringed a bit. It looked like the close-up shots of the creatures used models or actors in make-up, versus some poorly executed CGI for action shots and everything else.Most of the film is pretty dark and the camera motion made me feel queasy a time or two. Hopefully the practice of jerking a hand-held camera around to simulate intensity or panic will fade away as it's usually just annoying. If you are interested in caving or climbing you're more likely to enjoy this movie as well since they paid closer attention to those parts of the story.Overall, it's worth a rental if the shelves at your store are nearly bare. I don't understand why some are confused by the ending, Piper Perabo's comment and appearance made it clear that the filmmaker at least hoped to stir up interest for a sequel which would not necessarily involve a cave at all.

However, the earth is hollow and many of its caverns have remained unexplored.  (They are as remote to us as the craters on the moon.)  Who knows what dangerous life forms have been evolving in them since the beginning of time.In the remote mountains of Romanian, a chapel was built on top of the entrance to a cave system.  Engravings of winged serpents (dinosaurs?) adorn its walls.  Thirty years ago, an envoy of men drove through the chapel's barricades, ignored its warnings, and violated its inner sanctity.  An earthquake destroyed the chapel, causing the men to fall into the cave where prehistoric creatures were waiting.Fast forward to the present.  A team of professional ""cave divers"" have decided to explore a river running through a cavern that connects to the cave beneath the destroyed chapel.  One diver is attacked by a creature, his air tank explodes, and there is a cave in, trapping all of the divers miles beneath the surface.The divers must battle scorpions, eels with razor-sharp teeth, and hideous winged creatures as they search for an exit.  Worst of all, there is a parasite that mutates its host, turning it into a creature that can survive inside the dark caves.""The Cave"" is one of the best in the subterranean horror genre.  This science fiction horror gem is action packed from beginning to end.  The body count is high.  There is gore, but not enough to make you feel noxious.  The cast consists of attractive young stars who know how to act.  There is plenty of nail-biting suspense as the characters are constantly pursued through the caves.  Will they escape?  I won't tell, but the film has a nice surprise ending that demands a sequel.I watched ""The Cave"" along with three other films that are part of what I call the subterranean horror genre - films dealing with caves, caverns, mines, etc.  The other three are:  ""The Cavern,"" ""The Descent,"" and ""Caved In:  Prehistoric Terror.""  The best is ""The Descent,"" which is pure horror involving six trapped girls who discover blood-thirsty, evolutionary freaks.  ""The Cave"" is a great blend of science fiction, horror, and action adventure.

The latter is on screen for about ten minutes, total, and for six of those minutes he just runs around screaming.  Not a great opportunity to show off talent.  Hauser does a decent job, but the character he has to play is ludicrous and his lines are laughable, so you don't really notice his performance half the time.Everybody else is forgettable.  The female lead, in particular, is bland.The screenplay is aggravating.  We are told, in the beginning of the movie, that these characters are professionals and scientists, but they speak like losers.  For example, when they first go into The Cave, Blonde Girl screams, ""Totally awesome!""  While this is certainly the sentiment that comes to mind when seeing the set, you might think that a scientist would be able to say something a bit more intelligent.  Unfortunately, the dialogue stays around that same level of sophistication throughout.Needless to say, the characters are all flat and uninteresting.  But you probably guessed that already.But even with a bad script, bad acting, and a cliched plot, this movie could still have mustered at least a three star rating if it wasn't for the gaping plot holes and inconsistencies.  Dr. Old Guy and Dr. Hot Chick examine two slides of cells collected within The Cave and discover a parasite within them.  Then they find one of the monsters' claws and cut it open.  Within three seconds, they are able to conclude that the claw is infected with the parasite, too.  Huh?  They don't need a microscope or anything?  Okay, whatever....Dr. Hot Chick explains that they are dealing with a species that evolved in total isolation.  Uh, okay, don't know how she surmised all of that from exactly ten seconds of observing a claw, but then why would the monster be a parasite?  Isn't it a little bit contradictory for a parasite to live in an environment where there isn't much life to leech off of?And if the animals are predators, then why are they also parasites?  Shouldn't they just be eating the humans instead of infecting them and transforming them?  Do the monsters act like vampires and get to choose who transforms and who just turns into food?  And if they don't, then how have the monsters lived for so long in The Cave?  After a bazillion years in isolation, shouldn't everything be infected, and consequently they would've died from starvation?  Or are they cannibals?  And if they are cannibals, then why are they hunting the humans, specifically?The monsters just plain don't make any sense.  Sure, this isn't one of those newfangled ""thinking"" movies, but you would think that a couple of simple things could be sorted out before the filmmakers set out to film this crap.It all leads up to an ending which is among the lamest and least explicable endings I've ever seen.  I won't ruin it, but let me just say this: I thought the movie already couldn't get any more incomprehensible, and then I saw the ending.

Out of all of the movies I sat down to watch, most were very good, some examples would be ""Into the Blue"", ""Wedding Crashers"", and the always entertaining `Star Wars' saga, but one film that stood out as lackluster in my eyes, was the monster movie ""The Cave"".""The Cave"" is set deep in the Romanian forest, where a mysterious cave (hence the name of the movie), has captured the attention of a team of professional cave explorers.  Leading the team are Jack (Cole Hauser) and his brother Tyler (Eddie Cibrian), with the help of their crack-squad of spelunkers, which also includes Charlie (Piper Perabo) and Buchanan (Morris Chestnut), the team begins their exploration of the mysterious cave.  Years before the team arrived another group of people had gone to the site and never returned, which has caused this current exploration to discover what happened to the previous group, and to discover what, if anything is behind their disappearance.  But what the team finds just may be more than they bargained for.""The Cave"" had potential to be a very good monster movie.  The atmosphere was eerie, the actors were talented, and the production values appeared to be moderately high.  However, the problem this film ran into is that the story never draws you in.  You don't get a sense of respect/liking for any of the characters, and so when danger arises you are left with no feeling one way or another towards what happens to the characters.  The story is decent, it does borrow on previous monster/alien movies, such as ""Pitch Black"" and ""Alien"", but at least the movies it borrowed from were entertaining, which is something I can't say for this movie.  Another problem with this movie is that it appeared to be forced into the constraints of PG-13, so that the action is always hidden in the shadows.  This can prove to be a useful technique when properly executed, it provides a sense of dread and allows the director to avoid showing blood in order to meet certain restrictions, but instead it fails to evoke any sense of fear and dread, and makes parts of the film difficult to follow.  This is due mostly to the quick cuts made in the final edit of this film, where everything involving the monsters is somewhat blurred together in quick flashes.  I've never heard of the director of this movie, Bruce Hunt, not that this brings the movie down in any way, but if this is any indication as to what we can expect from future outings by this director, he may want to be wiser with his choice in material.Overall, I found ""The Cave"" to be disappointing and unengaging, which is sad given the acting talent, but sometimes even good actors aren't enough to save a movie.""The Cave"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",2,There Are Some Movies Man Should Never Make...,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,2896,"['Christmas', 'vacation', 'work', 'holidays', 'Christmas', 'New', 'Year', 'had', 'plenty', 'time', 'sit', 'down', 'catch', 'up', 'much', 'needed', 'movie', 'watching', 'movies', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'most', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'examples', 'would', 'be', 'Into', 'Blue', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Star', 'Wars', 'saga', 'one', 'film', 'stood', 'out', 'lackluster', 'eyes', 'was', 'monster', 'movie', 'Cave', 'Cave', 'set', 'deep', 'Romanian', 'forest', 'where', 'mysterious', 'cave', 'hence', 'name', 'movie', 'captured', 'attention', 'team', 'professional', 'cave', 'explorers', 'Leading', 'team', 'are', 'Jack', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'brother', 'Tyler', 'Eddie', 'Cibrian', 'help', 'crack-squad', 'spelunkers', 'also', 'Charlie', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'Buchanan', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'team', 'exploration', 'mysterious', 'cave', 'Years', 'team', 'arrived', 'group', 'people', 'had', 'gone', 'site', 'never', 'returned', 'caused', 'current', 'exploration', 'discover', 'what', 'happened', 'previous', 'group', 'discover', 'what', 'anything', 'disappearance', 'what', 'team', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'bargained', 'Cave', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'monster', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'eerie', 'actors', 'were', 'talented', 'production', 'values', 'appeared', 'be', 'moderately', 'high', 'However', 'problem', 'film', 'ran', 'story', 'never', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'respect/liking', 'characters', 'so', 'when', 'danger', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'one', 'way', 'towards', 'what', 'characters', 'story', 'decent', 'borrow', 'previous', 'monster/alien', 'movies', 'such', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Alien', 'least', 'movies', 'borrowed', 'were', 'entertaining', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'problem', 'movie', 'appeared', 'be', 'forced', 'constraints', 'PG-13', 'action', 'always', 'hidden', 'shadows', 'can', 'prove', 'be', 'useful', 'technique', 'when', 'properly', 'executed', 'sense', 'dread', 'director', 'avoid', 'showing', 'blood', 'order', 'meet', 'certain', 'restrictions', 'instead', 'evoke', 'sense', 'fear', 'dread', 'parts', 'film', 'difficult', 'follow', 'due', 'mostly', 'quick', 'cuts', 'made', 'final', 'edit', 'film', 'where', 'everything', 'involving', 'monsters', 'somewhat', 'blurred', 'together', 'quick', 'flashes', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'director', 'movie', 'Bruce', 'Hunt', 'not', 'movie', 'down', 'way', 'indication', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'future', 'outings', 'director', 'may', 'want', 'be', 'wiser', 'choice', 'material.Overall', 'found', 'Cave', 'be', 'disappointing', 'unengaging', 'sad', 'given', 'acting', 'talent', 'sometimes', 'even', 'good', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'movie', 'Cave', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'language']",N/A

And an interesting story line that was left open (of course) for sequels. That's where it ends.If there is a sequel, I hope they do a better job.The bad points:1. The music. Very misleading at some points. Not even gratuitiously. Too loud.2. For all the action happening in caves there was no feeling of claustraphobia.3. Scenes that should have been played tense, weren't. Most times the music got in the way.4. You never really get a good look at the creature. After all, that's what a creature feature is about.... the creature!The good points are that it is definitely an original story line and quite interesting too. This 'cave' has attracted people to it that ultimately never leave, but become the 'creatures'. A bit contrived, but explained by modern science, of course, as a parasite that takes over the body. Bad point to that is there is no real transformation going on in the movie.Another good point is the cinematography. Nicely done. Not sure if it is sets of actual location, but very believable. Lighting is carried well too.Comparing it to a classic creature feature such as 'Alien', it most definitely lacks the tension where it could have easily been played out. The action happens too fast at times and is hard to follow with the eyes. Should have been slowed down.I like the fact that they didn't rely on sped up or slowed down filming, or colorizing any sequels.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 8]","I'm not just talking about the cave in ""The Cave"" when I mention dark, dank, and dull, I'm talking about the acting, the direction, the special effects and the action as well.  In fact, the cave is actually pretty impressive at first, but if you've seen any shows on National Geographic about caves, you get over the awe inspired by the setting of this tale rather quickly.  Sure, the cave is actually a set and not a real cave, but you'd think that they'd have spent more money and time in developing the actual story.  The plot is the biggest hole in this snoozer.In it, a cave-diving team lead by Cole Hauser and Morris Chestnut delve into a cave in search of a new type of ecosystem.  The crew of divers and scientists quickly begin to go missing as their entrance into the cave is cut off and they attempt to find a new escape route.  Hauser is attacked by a creature but manages to survive.  Slowly he begins to transform into something that has super-sensitive hearing and very strange eyes.  As the story plods along, the group has to decide whether Hauser is leading them to their deaths or to safety.  His brother, played by future SciFi channel leadman Eddie Cibrian, and Chestnut are the only crewmembers who believe that Hauser's intentions are good.  The story plods along some more, people die in dark, cloudy action shots full of close-ups and a tad bit of blood and along the way they figure out exactly what is after them and how it affects them.Besides Chestnut, the only recognizable actor in this entire flick is Piper Perabo (Coyote Ugly).  Though I've never watched ""Lost,"" I gathered from another reviewer that the Asian guy in this flick is also on that show.  Anyways, this cast is rather dull as a whole.  Character development isn't present in any sense other than the fact that we establish Hauser and Cibrian as brothers.The creatures look like rip-offs of ""The Thing"" and ""Alien.""

950410,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000BUNZXS,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[16, 24]","As an audience member, there is nothing more frustrating than when a film with an intriguing premise fails miserably to present an appealing, or in this case horrifying, story with an intentional direction. With direction, the audience gets a purpose, a sense of reason for watching the film. When the reason fades away, the interest in the story wanders in different directions. One possibility is to begin the nitpicking of the flaws within the film while others might simply cease the viewing. The Cave presents a captivating introduction that in due course abandons the viewer in its feeble attempt to fight for survival.The Cave begins with a fascinating flashback into the Cold War in Romania some 30 years ago, which introduces the audience to the scary element of the story - a deep cave. After a difficult climb up the Carpathian Mountains, a group of treasure hunters arrive to their destination, a remote and long forgotten church. An ancient and secret atmosphere seems to linger around the church, as these men enter the religious domain. The walls of the basement have ominous reliefs of fanged and horned human skeletons while the floor is dressed in an extensive arabesque portraying demonic creatures. The audience must be brain dead not to sense the overwhelming atmosphere of lurking danger combined with the history vampirism in the Carpathian region. Despite the symbols perilous horror, the treasure hunters detonate a bomb to examine the possibility of a treasure, which leads them to a gigantic cave system below. This leaves the viewer with a potent tone that almost anything can appear from the depths of the Carpathian Mountains.Swiftly the film switches gears, as it jumps to present time. The geological scientist Dr. Nicolai (Marcel Iures) has uncovered the old cave system, after fallen rocks covered its opening 30 years ago. Once below, he discovers that the cave system has several sections underwater, and he therefore hires the best cave divers in the world to help with the exploration. Jack (Cole Hauser), the cave diver's leader, eagerly accepts the assignment with his crew's mutual approval. However, they would not have accepted the assignment, if they knew what evil dangers were lurking in the seemingly bottomless cave.The opening creates a good base for a story, which is about the only thing the film has to offer. With the build up the story had numerous alternative directions to choose from, but predictably, the expedition turns into a hide-and-seek horror tale that follows a similar path of the 1979 sci-fi horror film, Alien, which caused mass panic throughout the American theaters during its initial release. Unfortunately, The Cave does not provide this kind of experience, even though the initial suspense might indicate this. Instead, the film generates a travelogue in its tone, as it displays how they will get from point A to point B with the least amount of casualties. There are some additional ideas that pop up, but these do not increase the suspense, or drama within the story.The Cave presents a rather disappointing horror experience. It simply shows the audience what happens, and does not generate a thoroughly tense and apprehensive environment. There are some moments where the audience will jump, but these scenes do not build up a comprehensive frightening milieu. It merely feels as if the film tries to evoke suspense through the characters' quest for survival, but the characters do not seem important enough to gain the audience's support. Some of the positives within the film are the sounds and visuals, which show that they had some terrific knowledge on the set as the film looks and sounds amazing. The film even generates an internal desire to succeed, but overall feels rather uninteresting.",2,Uninteresting Horror Film with a Beguiling Premise and Opening...,1134691200,"12 16, 2005",2005,3777,"['audience', 'member', 'nothing', 'more', 'frustrating', 'when', 'film', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'miserably', 'present', 'appealing', 'case', 'horrifying', 'story', 'intentional', 'direction', 'direction', 'audience', 'purpose', 'sense', 'reason', 'watching', 'film', 'When', 'reason', 'away', 'interest', 'story', 'wanders', 'different', 'directions', 'One', 'possibility', 'begin', 'nitpicking', 'flaws', 'film', 'others', 'might', 'simply', 'cease', 'viewing', 'Cave', 'captivating', 'introduction', 'due', 'course', 'abandons', 'viewer', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'fight', 'survival.The', 'Cave', 'fascinating', 'flashback', 'Cold', 'War', 'Romania', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'audience', 'scary', 'element', 'story', 'deep', 'cave', 'difficult', 'climb', 'Carpathian', 'Mountains', 'group', 'treasure', 'hunters', 'arrive', 'destination', 'remote', 'long', 'forgotten', 'church', 'ancient', 'secret', 'atmosphere', 'linger', 'church', 'men', 'enter', 'religious', 'domain', 'walls', 'basement', 'have', 'ominous', 'reliefs', 'fanged', 'horned', 'human', 'skeletons', 'floor', 'dressed', 'extensive', 'arabesque', 'portraying', 'demonic', 'creatures', 'audience', 'must', 'be', 'brain', 'dead', 'not', 'sense', 'overwhelming', 'atmosphere', 'lurking', 'danger', 'combined', 'history', 'vampirism', 'Carpathian', 'region', 'symbols', 'perilous', 'horror', 'treasure', 'hunters', 'detonate', 'bomb', 'examine', 'possibility', 'treasure', 'gigantic', 'cave', 'system', 'viewer', 'potent', 'tone', 'almost', 'anything', 'can', 'appear', 'depths', 'Carpathian', 'Mountains.Swiftly', 'film', 'gears', 'present', 'time', 'geological', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Nicolai', 'Marcel', 'Iures', 'uncovered', 'old', 'cave', 'system', 'fallen', 'rocks', 'covered', 'opening', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'Once', 'cave', 'system', 'several', 'sections', 'underwater', 'therefore', 'best', 'cave', 'divers', 'world', 'help', 'exploration', 'Jack', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'cave', 'diver', 'leader', 'eagerly', 'assignment', 'crew', 'mutual', 'approval', 'However', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'accepted', 'assignment', 'knew', 'what', 'evil', 'dangers', 'were', 'lurking', 'seemingly', 'bottomless', 'cave.The', 'opening', 'good', 'base', 'story', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'offer', 'build', 'up', 'story', 'had', 'numerous', 'alternative', 'directions', 'choose', 'predictably', 'expedition', 'hide-and-seek', 'horror', 'tale', 'similar', 'path', '1979', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'film', 'Alien', 'caused', 'mass', 'panic', 'American', 'theaters', 'initial', 'release', 'Unfortunately', 'Cave', 'not', 'provide', 'kind', 'experience', 'even', 'initial', 'suspense', 'might', 'indicate', 'Instead', 'film', 'travelogue', 'tone', 'how', 'will', 'get', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'least', 'amount', 'casualties', 'are', 'additional', 'ideas', 'pop', 'up', 'do', 'not', 'increase', 'suspense', 'drama', 'story.The', 'Cave', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'horror', 'experience', 'simply', 'audience', 'what', 'not', 'generate', 'thoroughly', 'tense', 'apprehensive', 'environment', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'audience', 'will', 'jump', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'build', 'up', 'comprehensive', 'frightening', 'milieu', 'merely', 'film', 'tries', 'evoke', 'suspense', 'characters', 'quest', 'survival', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'important', 'enough', 'gain', 'audience', 'support', 'positives', 'film', 'are', 'sounds', 'visuals', 'show', 'had', 'terrific', 'knowledge', 'set', 'film', 'looks', 'amazing', 'film', 'even', 'internal', 'desire', 'succeed', 'overall', 'feels', 'rather', 'uninteresting']",N/A

Bernabo,"[1, 3]","This movie should have been called ""The Cavern,"" because when you tell me a movie is about a cave I expect something more claustrophobic than what we have in this 2005 film.  You say the word ""cave"" in early 2006 and it impossible not to think about the mining disasters that have been in the news.  You look at the cave in ""The Cave"" and it looks a lot more like Carlsbad Cavern, except with the Mississippi River flowing through it or something (the biggest surprise in the film is how much underwater photograph there is for a move that takes place in a cave and/or cavern).  Then again, you watch ""The Cave,"" and it does not take you long to trace its lineage back to ""Alien,"" except this time it is in a cave(rn) underground instead of a ship in space.That suggests there is not a lot of originality here, which is true, but that is not the biggest crime.  Once you accept the idea that this is a cavern and not merely a cave, then the unique location should have been a bigger part of the thrills and chills (in other words, think ""Cliffhanger"" inside the mountain instead of on top of it, except, of course, for the part that was inside the mountain; but I digress).  Thirty years ago while one party was investigating a cave in Romania, they discovered evidence of an ancient church of some sort and then something bad happened to the explorers.  We then jump forward to the there and now as a new team of explorers enters the cave and we know that most of them (at least) are going to die.Jack (Cole Hauser) is the leader of the pack, so he is the best bet to survive longest.  Dr. Nikolai (Marcel Iures) has to be around at least long enough to provide the necessary exposition and history, but once he does that his odds dip significantly.  Top Buchnana (Morris Chestnut) oozes confidence, but you know what they say about pride and in the cave(rn) the fall could be a long way down.  Jack's brother Tyler (Eddie Cibrian) is along and he is clearly going to be the guy in great danger at some point, while Charlie (Piper Perabo) would be the obvious damsel in distress.  Briggs (Rick Ravanello) and Strode (Kiernan Darcy-Smith) do the heavy lifting for the group and when one of them dies the question will be if you can remember which guy was which.  There is a scientist named Kathryn (Lena Headey), who can carry some of the necessary exposition but who is an unnecessary female since the other actress is more recognizable.  Then there is Kim (Daniel Dae Kim, who I knew could speak English because I watched him on ""Angel"") who takes the video of all the exploring and dying.They all go off spelunking in the cave, discover some strange animals of the likes no human has ever seen before (except for maybe the ones who died 30 years earlier), and then they become trapped, TRAPPED I tell you.  They think their problem is that they have to get out of the cave(rn) because they will run out of food and water around the time somebody back in the world knows the party is overdue, but really it is that they have to get out of the cave(rn) because otherwise they are going to be ripped to shreds.  However, the great irony here is that the best parts of this film are when nothing is happening because instead of looking at the people we do not care about or the things that are doing the killing, we can appreciate the cave(rn).

And since I've seen my fair share of documentaries on underwater cave explorations, I was especially intrigued to see how the filmmakers would go about constructing the film as realistically as possible.Unfortunately, it's just not that good, justifiably confirming the inkling that swept down on me after taking in the first 15 minutes of the film.I can appreciate how hard it must have been to make this movie.  Just looking at it, the production values are stunning.  I sat through most of the movie thinking, ""There's no way they reconstructed this many life-like caves on a soundstage.  Some of these set pieces have GOT to be the real thing.""  And the same goes for all the scenes in which the divers are swimming underwater with all their gear; it looks absolutely gorgeous with all the rich blues and greens, most of it brought to life with just the right amount of lighting.  The cinematography is to die for in this movie.  Those men and women who worked behind the scenes to give us all the excellent visuals are to be given a hearty congratulations and more than just one pat on the back.  Movie-making has never looked so gorgeous.And I can appreciate the effort the actors put forth into making this film.  I can only imagine the training they went through to prepare for such a grueling experience and the long hours they had to put in.  There's a LOT of climbing, swimming, falling down, and just general rough-and-tumble stunts going on here.  Physically, it had to be taxing, and to try and bring a bunch of words on paper to life during all that is understandably hard.So I can appreciate all that went into the movie to bring it to the big screen.  Unfortunately, the story just isn't that good.  And the scares don't resonate with the audience because we don't know enough about those being snuffed out to care.  So the old guy gets killed by the creature.  Okay . . . who was he again, and what was his story?  Constructing a bunch of one-note characters simply for the sake of killing them off does nothing for audiences who expect and deserve more.  And was anyone even remotely frightened of the creature?  I spent too much time trying to figure out the heck was going on with Shaky!Camera during those scenes as the creature was feasting on one cardboard character after another.  There's a difference between holding an audience in suspense by only revealing snippets of your antagonist (something done to perfection in ""Signs"") and pulling out the old ""I'll just spaz out with the camera so people can't figure out what it looks like!"" routine.  And while we're at it, overdoing the sound a creature makes when it's nearby is annoying.  When used sparingly, otherworldly guttural sounds can truly be foreboding and even frightening.  ""Signs"" ran well with this concept, and ""The Grudge"" hit one out of the park.In the end, I give this film two stars.  One star for the absolutely outstanding effort the filmmakers spent on making the film look as visually stunning as it does.  Not a single scene is wasted from a production values standpoint.  And I give the second star to the actors who, even though they made a movie that will quickly be forgotten by most of the viewing audience, worked their tails off by doing the best they could with the material they were given.Oh, what could have been.",2,"""Oh, what could have been . . .""",1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,3445,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'looked', 'spectacular', 'visual', 'standpoint', 'premise', 'sounded', 'promising', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'fair', 'share', 'documentaries', 'underwater', 'cave', 'explorations', 'was', 'especially', 'intrigued', 'see', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'go', 'constructing', 'film', 'as', 'realistically', 'possible.Unfortunately', 'just', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'justifiably', 'confirming', 'inkling', 'swept', 'down', 'taking', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'film.I', 'can', 'appreciate', 'how', 'hard', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'movie', 'Just', 'looking', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'stunning', 'sat', 'most', 'movie', 'thinking', 'way', 'reconstructed', 'many', 'life-like', 'caves', 'soundstage', 'set', 'pieces', 'have', 'GOT', 'be', 'real', 'thing', 'same', 'scenes', 'divers', 'are', 'swimming', 'underwater', 'gear', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'rich', 'blues', 'greens', 'most', 'brought', 'life', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'die', 'movie', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'worked', 'scenes', 'give', 'excellent', 'visuals', 'are', 'be', 'given', 'hearty', 'congratulations', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'pat', 'back', 'Movie-making', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'gorgeous.And', 'can', 'appreciate', 'effort', 'actors', 'put', 'forth', 'making', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'training', 'went', 'prepare', 'such', 'grueling', 'experience', 'long', 'hours', 'had', 'put', 'LOT', 'climbing', 'swimming', 'falling', 'down', 'just', 'general', 'rough-and-tumble', 'stunts', 'going', 'here', 'Physically', 'had', 'be', 'taxing', 'try', 'bring', 'bunch', 'words', 'paper', 'life', 'understandably', 'hard.So', 'can', 'appreciate', 'went', 'movie', 'bring', 'big', 'screen', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'scares', 'do', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'being', 'snuffed', 'out', 'care', 'old', 'guy', 'killed', 'creature', 'Okay', 'who', 'was', 'again', 'what', 'was', 'story', 'Constructing', 'bunch', 'one-note', 'characters', 'simply', 'sake', 'killing', 'off', 'nothing', 'audiences', 'who', 'expect', 'deserve', 'more', 'was', 'anyone', 'even', 'remotely', 'frightened', 'creature', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'heck', 'was', 'going', 'Shaky', 'Camera', 'scenes', 'creature', 'was', 'feasting', 'one', 'cardboard', 'character', 'difference', 'holding', 'audience', 'suspense', 'only', 'revealing', 'snippets', 'antagonist', 'something', 'done', 'perfection', 'Signs', 'pulling', 'out', 'old', ""'ll"", 'just', 'spaz', 'out', 'camera', 'so', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'routine', ""'re"", 'overdoing', 'sound', 'creature', 'when', 'nearby', 'annoying', 'When', 'used', 'sparingly', 'otherworldly', 'guttural', 'sounds', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'foreboding', 'even', 'frightening', 'Signs', 'ran', 'well', 'concept', 'Grudge', 'hit', 'one', 'park.In', 'end', 'give', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'One', 'star', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'effort', 'filmmakers', 'spent', 'making', 'film', 'look', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Not', 'single', 'scene', 'wasted', 'production', 'values', 'standpoint', 'give', 'second', 'star', 'actors', 'who', 'even', 'made', 'movie', 'will', 'quickly', 'be', 'forgotten', 'most', 'viewing', 'audience', 'worked', 'tails', 'off', 'doing', 'best', 'could', 'material', 'were', 'given.Oh', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

The movie is filled with horror film clich&eacute;s and the acting leaves something to be desired in places, but I liked the H.R. Giger inspired look and the creatures were cool.  I also thought the ending, though somewhat expected, was tidy and enjoyable.The plot is transplanted from other horror movies.  A group of divers descend into a newly discovered cave.  Once the divers enter the cave, they realize they are not alone, but only after the entrance to the cave collapses and the divers become trapped.  The divers need to escape the cave and the hungry creatures that inhabit it.Sometimes movies are not so much about the ending, but the journey to get there.  This movie has its moments of absurdity and silliness, but I keep thinking about those charming underground creatures and remember that I can forgive a lot for a well-made monster.  The monsters in this movie are nicely made.  I also enjoyed the cave.  The cave may have been produced on a set, but it was an excellent set.  I should point out that several places in this movie were just short of scary, but did startle me somewhat.""The Cave"" is hardly breakthrough and the acting was only average.  Yet, I enjoy creature movies and I enjoyed this one.  While there are many better movies, there are also many worse.

Producers have gotten wise and decided to set these movies in that locale to enhance authenticity.  THE CAVE is another movie set in the Carpathian mountains, and for a film of its ilk, it's a decent thriller.  The movie opens in the 70s with a spelunking crew investigating a mammoth cave deep in the Carpathians and their ultimate dastardly fate.  Switch to present day and another crack team of spelunkers is summoned to investigate the same cave.  Of course, things go horribly awry when a cave in seals them in the subterranean depths and they find they are NOT alone, as some kind of horrifying creature starts picking them off.  Add to this a nasty parasite that just might have affected the team leader and you are set for the ultimate confrontation.The creatures are reminiscent of HR Giger's classic ALIEN, with some plotlines stolen from THE THING.  The acting is unremarkable but serviceable:  Cole Hauser, Eddie Cibrian, Lena Heady, Piper Perabo and Morris Chestnut being the most recognizable of the stars.

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","If you've seen The Descent you've got an idea of what lurks in The Cave, a film with a similar premise that also was released theatrically in 2005. To wit, explorers conduct an excavation in the mountains of Romania for twelve days. They're supposedly there to do research, but truth be told they are really just mutant bat chow.Dr. Nicolai (Marcel Iures) and his associate Kathryn Jennings (Lena Headey), believe that the cave could contain an undiscovered ecosystem.  They hire American spelunkers lead by Jack McAllister (Cole Hauser) and his brother Tyler (Eddie Cibrian) as guides. The diving team includes rock-climbing professional Charlie (Piper Perabo, sporting a sports bra), first scout Briggs (Rick Ravanello), sonar expert Strode (Kieran Darcy-Smith), survival expert Top Buchanan (Morris Chestnut), and cameraman Alex Kim (Daniel Dae Kim). Like all movies of this type, it includes sci-fi levels of equipment, including a modified rebreather system that can allow a diver to stay underwater for up to 24 hours and an Aliens-style SONAR system for exploring caves.As evidenced by the special equipment, The Cave could easily be renamed The Underwater River due to the sheer number of underwater scenes.  The Cave may disturb audience members who are afraid of the dark - it's filmed in a real cave - but those with hydrophobia will definitely be creeped out. Of course, the real threat is the mutant bats.SPOILER: The twist is that the creatures in this cave are actually a form of ancient pathogen that mutates its host, and the bat humanoids are actually just other spelunkers in the wrong place at the wrong time.And so our much-too-fat herd of attractive spelunkers, scientists, and cameramen is thinned out by a roving band of brachiating, flapping predators that use Monster-vision --  err, SONAR - to find their prey.  We get a visual representation of how these things see, which will be important later when of one of the crew uses one of these devices to fend the critters off and the other to blow himself up.  You guess which is which.The monsters themselves are hulking gorilla-like albino bats with an Aliens-style twist to their features. They skitter and climb convincingly, and they make suitable opponents to the team members - particularly Charlie's standoff, which is one of the few instances of a survivor fighting back.  Mostly, people just get pulled underwater or into a tunnel, screaming as they go.On the Syfy channel, The Cave fits right in.

Michael Steinberg has directed some very good movies (The Waterdance being, likely, the most famous of them) over the years, and he and co-writer Tegan West previously collaborated on another script, the romantic comedy Sleep with Me. Why they decided to try their hands at an underground monster movie is beyond me. They then picked up a cast of has-beens, wannabes, and not-evers, took them to Romania for the basement-budget treatment, and threw them in a cave. Fun!In any case, the plot, what little there is of it: a team of spelunkers, led by Jack (Pitch Black's Cole Hauser), explore a Romanian cave. They are not alone. (And now you find out why all the hired actors are work-to-scale types: 98% of the movies' budget was spent on a silly-looking creature.) They are also not at the top of this particular ecosystem's food chain. I don't think you can call that a spoiler, really.I'm not exactly sure where par would be for a basement-budget B-grade monster movie, but wherever par is, just about everything in this movie comes in under it. The locations look like they might be great, but the lighting and cinematography does nothing to play them up in its best bits, and obscures them in its worst. The acting ranges from kind of competent (Morris Chestnut, whose film career ranked as ""very promising"" ten years ago, and has since slipped into, well, doing stuff like this) to just plain silly (Hauser, Piper Perabo, Lena Headey's sillier scenes). The script is blah most of the time, except when it slides into painful clich&eacute; and cheap titillate-the-audience tricks. And the ending? Oh, you're going to love the ending. Assuming, that is, you haven't seen any monster movie made since, oh, the 1930s.

At least this time we have young adults in peril instead of teens. I realize I am being cynical, though it is difficult not to disparage a film when every one of the actors and actresses is young and good-looking. There is nothing wrong with including young and good-looking individuals in a film; it certainly makes the viewing experience more pleasant. Yet, how seriously can I take a movie when there is no good reason for casting this way other than to cater to a certain an audience that cares more about the attractiveness of the cast than the content of the film? This certainly seals its fate as an average (at best) film because we know artistic vision and profundity have been relegated as inferior to superficiality. It is too bad, really, because this story had potential. After the first couple minutes, during which Romanian soldiers stumble across mosaics depicting winged creatures of death in an ancient cathedral, I thought it might turn out to be better than its mediocre reputation. Over the next few minutes, however, I began to get that sinking feeling as the hunky, bland cast was introduced. It then became apparent this would be another clich&eacute;d, formulaic film. I could forgive the fact it is more or less ""Alien"" set in Earth's underground rather than in space because the production values here are top-notch. Aside from the relatively high budget and the occasional swear word, however, there isn't much here to distinguish it from the average made-for-the-Sci-Fi-Channel flick.

Whether alien planet or dark underground caverns, backdrop is important to a horror film, and the location of this film helps to highlight the monstrosities that come crawling out to greet their guests.The film starts with a group of treasure hunters who break into this ancient church, hoping to discover riches buried underneath the decorative seal on the floor.  After a silly mistake in which they blow up the seal while standing too close, they all fall down.  Screaming.Later, in more modern times, a group of scientists and cave divers enter, hoping to go where no man has gone before.  They set up a base camp in a cavern while sending a diver through a long, long underwater tunnel to map it out.  Because of a strange message from said diver after he enters the next cavern, the entire team, typical of b-horror, follows.  The tunnel collapses behind them, about the same time our crew discovers they are not alone in the cave.  Trapped, with no communication to the outside and low on food and water, our merry group of mistake-makers must find a way out before they are all eaten.  Rock wall climbing, ice climbing, diving, riding down wild water tunnels and waterfalls, hiding in still pools, escape begins to look bleaker and bleaker as the way out becomes harder to reach.The scenery and photography are great, the cave is creepy and dark, and the acting, while not memorable, is not as bad as some folks have mentioned.  The best part, as with any monster movie, are the monsters.  Sinister and pale, slimy and toothy, tricky and clever, hungry and unpredictable, its lunchtime underground as our beastly brutes stalk the humans.  There are a few revelations to be made along the way, such as discovering they are parasitical and can fly, the parasitical aspect leaving members of the human team suspect.Okay, so 'The Cave' is not the kind of movie that will ever be up for an award, and it's not the kind of movie that should be analyzed too closely.  'The Cave' is a movie that you kick back and enjoy with some beer and popcorn, surround sound turned on, and wait for the deliciously bizarre and slimy human-eaters to appear.

The premise hooks us because it is so PRIMAL: we're afraid of such places - and to make matters worse, frightening creatures are lurking in the shadows and beneath the waters that flow through the cave system. The situation provides a strong engine for such a story.But ""situation"" is not enough - it should serve as a springboard for memorable, sympathetic characters to say and do interesting things throughout a strong chain of scenes. And that's the problem - THE CAVE seems somewhat lost and confused, sort of like the characters themselves. This is regrettable because, as an audience, we're all geared up: we've suspended our disbelief and we've entered THE CAVE as willing participants. But we don't bond with the characters in this crucible situation the way we do in a movie like Jaws or Alien. They don't unfold to us in a way that draws us in, making us feel what they feel, charming us with their personalities - at least not as strongly as in the greater films cited. I attribute this fault to the script more than the actors. Stronger material might have allowed an actor like Daniel Dae Kim to strut his stuff (whose star rose with the TV show LOST, precisely because its material was so character-driven and excellent), but, alas, that doesn't really happen for any character in this piece.Still, there are multiple dimensions to a film, and I give a lot of credit to its makers for crafting a gorgeous film. Its look, feel, sounds, and creatures are all outstanding. As a purely right-brained exercise, this movie is fun for the senses. It may not be cinematic filet-mignon, but sometimes one is hungry for McDonald's and can find much satisfaction in a Big Mac. I know I can.As Stephen King has said, we're all connoisseurs of trash. You've got yours and I've got mine. And so I won't judge this film too harshly. It's a film I bought and have kept in my collection. And something causes me to revisit it now and again, especially when I'm not sure what else to watch. It's fun and it entertains on enough levels for me, at least. Enough that I keep coming back to THE CAVE.If you haven't seen it yet, I'd encourage you to give it a spin (especially genre fans). It just might exceed your expectations - or not.

950465,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BUNZXS,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 4]","OK. In `The Cave,' for the reason we don't really care, one exploration team goes down deep into the cave in the Carpathian mountains and find that they are not alone. In this kind of film, in which we are to watch a close encounter with something horrible, or some creatures (that Patrick Tatopoulos designed), we should stop asking ourselves why these characters do such and such stupid things, or speak such and such silly dialogues That's because we want is, after all, actions, thrills, excitement that you find in masterpieces like `Alien.'Sadly you don't find them, any of them, in `The Cave.' I can happily ignore the film's ridiculous story about the cave diver team who are so reckless to risk their lives in the subterranean water, but when most actions are far from tension-packed with banal acting and bad editing, their incredible behaviors start to look unwittingly funny. Imagine, if you please, an expedition team member who can casually pick up a huge mole (or huge mouse) carelessly in the dark. Professional, isn't it?  Or how about lovely Piper Perabo fighting with a slimy and deadly creature, who keeps crying with her high-pitched voice? Actually, her scene is the best action of the entire film, the only good one, and still she is too good for this rip-off.There are good things, though. The underwater images are all beautifully shot, and the film makers are rightly proud of its production designs of the huge cave, which is simply impressive. Cole Hauser is effectively cast as the glum leader of the team, who gives a nice twist or two in the plot, but the rest of the cast is just OK, with Eddie Cibrian, Morris Chestnut, Rick Ravanello, Daniel Dae Kim, Kieran Darcy-Smith, Marcel Iures, and Lena Headey.But the facts still remains that `The Cave' is routine, borrowing so many things from other superior thrillers, and it is less appealing when compared to `The Descent' much better and scarier film. Both films go deep into the cave, but only one of them gives the sense of danger and tension of being there, and you know which I am talking about if you have already seen it.",2,'The Cave' Keeps Going Down But It Is No 'Descent': Needs Better Storytelling and Originality,1161302400,"10 20, 2006",2006,2108,"['OK', 'Cave', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'one', 'exploration', 'team', 'down', 'deep', 'cave', 'Carpathian', 'mountains', 'find', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'kind', 'film', 'are', 'watch', 'close', 'encounter', 'something', 'horrible', 'creatures', 'Patrick', 'Tatopoulos', 'designed', 'should', 'stop', 'asking', 'why', 'characters', 'do', 'such', 'such', 'stupid', 'things', 'speak', 'such', 'such', 'silly', 'dialogues', 'want', 'actions', 'thrills', 'excitement', 'find', 'masterpieces', 'Alien', ""'Sadly"", 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'Cave', 'can', 'happily', 'ignore', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'story', 'cave', 'diver', 'team', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'reckless', 'risk', 'lives', 'subterranean', 'water', 'when', 'most', 'actions', 'are', 'far', 'tension-packed', 'banal', 'acting', 'bad', 'editing', 'incredible', 'behaviors', 'start', 'look', 'unwittingly', 'funny', 'Imagine', 'please', 'expedition', 'team', 'member', 'who', 'can', 'casually', 'pick', 'up', 'huge', 'mole', 'huge', 'mouse', 'carelessly', 'dark', 'Professional', ""n't"", 'how', 'about', 'lovely', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'fighting', 'slimy', 'deadly', 'creature', 'who', 'crying', 'high-pitched', 'voice', 'Actually', 'scene', 'best', 'action', 'entire', 'film', 'only', 'good', 'one', 'still', 'too', 'good', 'rip-off.There', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'though', 'underwater', 'images', 'are', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'makers', 'are', 'rightly', 'proud', 'production', 'designs', 'huge', 'cave', 'simply', 'impressive', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'effectively', 'cast', 'glum', 'leader', 'team', 'who', 'nice', 'twist', 'two', 'plot', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'OK', 'Eddie', 'Cibrian', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Rick', 'Ravanello', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'Kieran', 'Darcy-Smith', 'Marcel', 'Iures', 'Lena', 'Headey.But', 'facts', 'still', 'Cave', 'routine', 'borrowing', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'other', 'superior', 'thrillers', 'less', 'appealing', 'when', 'compared', 'Descent', 'much', 'better', 'scarier', 'film', 'films', 'go', 'deep', 'cave', 'only', 'one', 'sense', 'danger', 'tension', 'being', 'there', 'know', 'am', 'talking', 'have', 'already', 'seen']",N/A

The film has some amazing scenery and the design of everything used in the film is quite realistic. That shouldn't be all that surprising because according to one of the film's producers, Andrew Mason, the filmmakers hired some of the world's best cave divers as technical consultants. Unfortunately, they must have spent most of their money on those consultations. If you have a movie with realistic locations, scenery, props, but everything else is cheap and fake, you end up with a really bad movie.After the film's beautifully filmed opening scene, the movie shifts gears and we are introduced to a group of young and attractive cave explorers. But like just about every movie involving a cave, the cave collapses and the explorers have to find a different way out. Of course, they are also being hunted by some sort of carnivorous humanoid creatures. Throw in some mumbo-jumbo that doesn't make any sense about mutating parasites, a nod to lycanthropy, and a &#34;twist&#34; ending and that sums up THE CAVE.The acting is terrible and the few glimmers of decent performances are swamped by the poor directing and bad directing. Even the best actors in the world would have a tough time when they have to face every horror clich&eacute; in the book. Then there's the terrible dialogue (I don't think a twenty-something women with a doctorate would say &#34;totally awesome&#34;). Oh, and did I mention the plot holes? Scotty and his team on the original &#34;Star Trek&#34; would be put to shame by the results the people on this cave-exploring team can get done with so little equipment and short amount of time. It's, totally awesome!If you're looking for a crappy movie with some beautiful scenery (shot mostly in Romania), then THE CAVE just might be a picture you might want to see. Turn the volume off and fast-forward through the action scenes and it'll look like you're watching a show from the Discovery Channel.

The film swipes its premise from a half dozen other horror films but for a change this doesn't take place in outer space but inner space--in the underwater caves of Romania. It's not quite as memorable as ""Pitch Black"" or ""Alien"" (which itself ripped off its plot from ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"" among others) and is worth a rental if nothing else.A group of divers take an expedition into a group of underwater caves, are stranded when a cave in cuts them off from the surface. They discover that they are being hunted by a nasty predator and desperately try to find a way back to the surface before they become fish food.Cole Hauser (""Pitch Black"")stars in the film and the direction is brisk. The underwater footage some of which is actual footage shot by a second unit diving team is beautiful. The film seamlessly combines film and HD video shot on some of the dives. The impressive sets certainly hold their own and make the film much more impressive than it really is.The image and sound quality are top notch. We get two featurettes one of which discusses the underwater filming and the divers that do this for a living. It's actually a superior featurette. The second is on the creation of the cave creatures. It's interesting because the approach is much more about why they designed the creature the way they did than how. We also get two audio commentaries. One with the writers who discuss (quite diplomatically I might add)the compromises they had to make to the script to bring it in on budget and that includes the elimination of a couple of truly outrageous sequences as well as more character development and a romantic subplot. The director and producer give a much more production orientated focus to their commentary track discussing production challenges they faced in the making of the movie.""The Cave"" isn't great art nor does it pretend to be. It's better than something you might see on cable and some some truly stunning stunts and set pieces that make it a worthwhile rental. Don't expect great art or a big dose of originality and you'll enjoy ""The Cave"" for what it is--a derivative rollercoaster ride of a movie.",3,Solid horror entry not as bad as claimed 2 1/2 stars,1142035200,"03 11, 2006",2006,2244,"['are', ""n't"", 'gems', 'Cave', 'also', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'everyone', 'film', 'premise', 'half', 'dozen', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'change', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'outer', 'space', 'inner', 'space', 'underwater', 'caves', 'Romania', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'memorable', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Alien', 'ripped', 'off', 'plot', 'Terror', 'Beyond', 'Space', 'others', 'rental', 'nothing', 'else.A', 'group', 'divers', 'take', 'expedition', 'group', 'underwater', 'caves', 'are', 'stranded', 'when', 'cave', 'cuts', 'off', 'surface', 'discover', 'are', 'being', 'hunted', 'nasty', 'predator', 'desperately', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'surface', 'become', 'fish', 'food.Cole', 'Hauser', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'film', 'direction', 'brisk', 'underwater', 'footage', 'actual', 'footage', 'shot', 'second', 'unit', 'diving', 'team', 'beautiful', 'film', 'seamlessly', 'film', 'HD', 'video', 'shot', 'dives', 'impressive', 'sets', 'certainly', 'hold', 'own', 'make', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'really', 'is.The', 'image', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'get', 'two', 'featurettes', 'one', 'underwater', 'filming', 'divers', 'do', 'living', 'actually', 'superior', 'featurette', 'second', 'creation', 'cave', 'creatures', 'interesting', 'approach', 'much', 'more', 'why', 'designed', 'creature', 'way', 'did', 'how', 'also', 'get', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'One', 'writers', 'who', 'discuss', 'quite', 'diplomatically', 'might', 'add', 'compromises', 'had', 'make', 'script', 'bring', 'budget', 'elimination', 'couple', 'truly', 'outrageous', 'sequences', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'director', 'producer', 'give', 'much', 'more', 'production', 'orientated', 'focus', 'commentary', 'track', 'discussing', 'production', 'challenges', 'faced', 'making', 'movie', 'Cave', ""n't"", 'great', 'art', 'pretend', 'be', 'better', 'something', 'might', 'see', 'cable', 'truly', 'stunning', 'stunts', 'set', 'pieces', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'rental', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'art', 'big', 'dose', 'originality', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Cave', 'what', 'derivative', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'movie']",N/A
950470,A4OSXRZR2BMX8,B000BUNZXS,"William Merrill ""eclecticist""","[1, 2]","I should have followed the critics' recommendations and avoided this movie.  The premise of this film was an interesting one - the exploration of an ancient, vast underground cave system that may contain ""demon-like"" creatures - but the movie made from it is ultra-lame.  There's way too much thrashing around in the water without very much actually happening.  Just one example of my many frustrations with this flick is how there were a lot of underwater scenes of people swimming around (shot from below), but we rarely see anything coming up from down in the depths to grab somebody.  Most of the action scenes are just a blur -- it's really just about impossible to understand what's going on from moment to moment in the action scenes.  In one scene, the main character, Jack, gets bitten by something (apparently one of the alien creatures) - a large tear on the back of his shoulder - but we never see him getting chomped at the time it happens.  We only see the wound when he rejoins his companions.  The actual moment of the attack is just a bunch of blurry thrashing in the water.  This kind of lazy film-making may have been caused by a lack of creativity, or budget limitations, or both, but it's an insult to the viewer.
