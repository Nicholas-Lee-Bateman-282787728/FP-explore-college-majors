663352,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005LIR8,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I think there's a good bet that you'll like this movie too.  No, the Farelly brothers didn't direct, but they produced, and their stamp of approval can be seen all over this film.  Like `...Mary', this film contains a slew of gross out gags that actually nail the punch line they are after, and the film is supporting on the strong shoulders of a beautiful woman; in this case Heather Graham (where is her everlasting career?).The film revolves around a dimwitted couple, Gilly and Jo, who happen to fall madly in love and, soon after consummating that love, find out that Gilly is really Jo's long lost brother.Ouch.Jo flees and Gilly is ostrasized for `tapping his sister', but he can't shake his feelings for her.  When he finds out that there was a mistake and Jo isn't his sister, he makes a mad dash for Beaver, Oregon where Jo is set to marry a total creep.  Sadly, Jo's mother is up in arms against a Gilly and Jo reunion, so she intervenes with local authorities, making it extremely difficult for Gilly to `get the girl'.  Like every other rom-com, we all know how this one ends (he does `get the girl') but watching him get there is a hilarious ride.My one real complaint here is Chris Klein.  I kind of hate him.  He has no real acting ability.  He pouts like an Abercrombie model; that is all.  He also sounds like a girl.  It's hard for me to take him seriously.  His `gentle jock' routine gets played out quickly and winds up being a major hindrance in nearly every role he chooses, this one included.I didn't want to root for him.That said, Heather Graham is wonderful and Sally Field is a nice surprise (gotta love her, right).  The overall effect of the film is well played and the gags keep coming.  Some will certainly find this offensive, but what else would you expect from an R-rated comedy about a guy who sleeps with his sister; allegedly.",4,If you like `There's Something About Mary'...,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,1864,"['think', 'good', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'too', 'No', 'Farelly', 'brothers', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'produced', 'stamp', 'approval', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'film', 'Mary', 'film', 'slew', 'gross', 'gags', 'actually', 'nail', 'punch', 'line', 'are', 'film', 'supporting', 'strong', 'shoulders', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'case', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'where', 'everlasting', 'career', '.The', 'film', 'around', 'dimwitted', 'couple', 'Gilly', 'Jo', 'who', 'happen', 'fall', 'madly', 'love', 'soon', 'consummating', 'love', 'find', 'out', 'Gilly', 'really', 'Jo', 'long', 'lost', 'brother.Ouch.Jo', 'flees', 'Gilly', 'ostrasized', 'tapping', 'sister', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'feelings', 'When', 'out', 'was', 'mistake', 'Jo', ""n't"", 'sister', 'mad', 'dash', 'Beaver', 'Oregon', 'where', 'Jo', 'set', 'marry', 'total', 'creep', 'Sadly', 'Jo', 'mother', 'up', 'arms', 'Gilly', 'Jo', 'reunion', 'local', 'authorities', 'making', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'Gilly', 'get', 'girl', 'other', 'rom-com', 'know', 'how', 'one', 'get', 'girl', 'watching', 'get', 'hilarious', 'ride.My', 'one', 'real', 'complaint', 'here', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'kind', 'hate', 'real', 'acting', 'ability', 'Abercrombie', 'model', 'also', 'girl', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'gentle', 'jock', 'routine', 'played', 'out', 'quickly', 'up', 'being', 'major', 'hindrance', 'nearly', 'role', 'one', 'included.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'root', 'said', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'wonderful', 'Sally', 'Field', 'nice', 'surprise', 'got', 'ta', 'right', 'overall', 'effect', 'film', 'well', 'played', 'gags', 'keep', 'coming', 'will', 'certainly', 'find', 'offensive', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'guy', 'who', 'sister', 'allegedly']",N/A

663356,ADA56HQ6DIP4U,B00005LIR8,Carlton D. Fisher,"[2, 5]","Say It Isn't So follows the rules for it's brand of comedy. Unfortunately, it seems to take a by the numbers approach to do that.  While the &quot;gross out&quot; comedy has become a bit of a staple in the current film industry, there are always levels of ability.  Just as there were great new-teen slasher flicks (like Scream), there were copy cat also-rans (like I Know What You Did Last Summer) and uninspired attempts at cashing in (like Valentine).  While pleasant enough and worth at least a viewing, this movie leaves little impact.  The romance feels gushy and forced and the comedy stretches too far at the expense of remaining true to the story.  (Chris Klein gets his hand stuck in the back end of a cow while trying to get it to move and it drags him into town.)  This would probably best be described as the &quot;Valentine&quot; of it's genre--a nice idea executed poorly in the attempt to get cash from the passing bandwagon.  Heather Graham's performance seems phoned in from a soap opera set.  Chris Klein offers a fairly dead on &quot;bumbling lovable guy&quot; performance from the Hugh Grant school of acting.  The true star turn though is Sally Field as a trailer trash opportunistic mother hell-bent on marrying her daughter off to a rich jerk.  Field shines as a truly great comic actress and should do more of this work instead of getting caught in feel-good tearjerking dreck.

'Say It Isn't So' - the heartwarming story of a young dog-catcher who finally finds the right woman, only for her to be his sister - contains at least two direct allusions to Bunuel's work - the upending of a disabled person ('L'Age D'Or'); and the use of female body hair as a male beard ('Un Chien Andalou') - but the film is imbued with his anarchic spirit, his satirical targets, his motifs and his procedures.  Like 'L'Age D'Or' or 'That Obscure Object Of Desire', 'Say' is a tale of amour fou and frustrated love, in which a 'nice' or 'respectable' man, humiliated and degraded through his obsession with an unattainable woman, becomes crazed and violent - the scene where the former animal-rights sentimentalist starts abusing a cow is truly shocking.  As in many Bunuel films, the uncontainable sexual energy derailing the characters is displaced onto the euphemistic imagery - most notably, images of castration abound (bad hair-cuts, ears being lopped off etc.), that suggest the infantaile sexuality or masculine crisis that afflicts the hero, whose downfall is orchestrated by his false mother.  This undermining of masculinity is seen in the various violences done the male body throughout the film.  Genre is invoked only to be brutally undercut - the road movie, the Western, but especially the romantic comedy, which is nauseatingly indulged in the first quarter hour only to be smashed by the shock revelation.  As in 'Viridiana' and 'Los Olvidados', the 'normal', heterosexual narrative, with its attractive stars and conventional linearity, is mocked by the profusion of 'beggar'-type grotesques - in this film, they are the norm, the pretty people are the freaks and perverts.  Teeming animal imagery bleakly undemines the human pretensions towards the Ideal and Progress, both hobbled by instinct.  All this allows the filmmakers to indulge in hostile, anti-bourgeois sentiments, attacking marriage, the family (Paul Hammond suggests the affair in 'L'Age D'Or' is incestuous; see also the acronym of this movie), bourgeois greed and hypocrisy, and the complicit Law are all violently attacked.  If the paralell sounds far-fetched, we must remember that Bunuel denigrated the European art film, and celebrated popular Hollywood modes such as slapstick comedy and melodrama.On the other hand, we could see 'Say' as a crass attempt to ape producers the Farrelly Bros., retreading their most famous set-pieces, characters and plot developments (sticky stuff in hair; problems with cows; decent hero put through comic horrors in pursuit of svelte girl; the gathering of a community of the disabled).

Girl moves away to marry someone else, leaving boy at home with new mom and pop. Boy finds out girl is not his sister. Boy rushes out to find girl, but is thwarted by people who think boy is a pervert for slamming his sister. Boy, is this a boring story.Chances are, if you got tired halfway through reading that introductory paragraph, then ""Say It Isn't So"" will have the same effect on you (that is, if you don't walk out first). From the producers of ""There's Something About Mary,"" the film makes many attempts to be like that film, though with less pleasing results. The comedy starts out somewhat funny, but this is no gut buster, and by the first half hour, the material is just plain boring.The film begins in Indiana, where simple Gilly Noble (Chris Klein) narrates the opening credits about his dream of finding the perfect woman to share his life with. His dream soon comes true when he meets Jo Wingfield (Heather Graham), a hairdresser who gives him a patented ""There's Something About Mary"" hairstyle and cuts his ear off when he tells her he's found her cat.Of course, Jo's mother, Valdine (Sally Field), isn't thrilled about the relationship, so when Gilly is told by a hired detective that Valdine is his birth mother, Valdine hides the truth to prevent the two from being together, hoping that Jo will go back to her rich ex-boyfriend. And since Gilly and Jo have already slept together, he is now marked for life as the ""sister slammer.""So what happens next? If you really want to know, read on. It turns out Gilly is not related to Jo or her family, and makes his way to Beaver, Oregon, to stop her wedding to Jack. Valdine's true son comes home, and she uses him as a ploy to keep Jo from taking Gilly seriously when he arrives. Will they or won't they end up together?After five minutes, who really cares? I didn't. The film is constantly unfunny and aimless, one that is certainly below the standards of gross-out comedy, which is so desperately strives to be. There are some gross-out scenes, yes; one involves Gilly's hand stuck inside the rectum of a cow, after which he pulls it out, only to discover that his engagement ring was left behind, so you can guess what happens next.Other scenes involve Chris Klein disguising himself with leftover body hair from wax strips in a beauty parlor dumpster, Sally Field rubbing a sandwich in her armpits for ""extra saltiness,"" and Jo's stroke-stricken father using crude language and vulgarities right and left. For some movies, such as ""American Pie,"" moments like these are funny; in the case of ""Say It Isn't So,"" they are stale. I didn't believe in any of the comic gags the movie threw at me; they just weren't that humorous.Other scenes that don't involve crudeness are just as plain. When Gilly uses a plane to fly a banner saying ""I'm not your brother, marry me,"" the ""not"" becomes detached, and you can guess the reaction of the crowd.

This film is so uninspired and pathetic.  It's not funny either.  Most of the humor is so repulsive it would only be funny to a few horny teenage boys.The characters are MISERABLE.  You end up hating them instead of emphasizing with them.  There are many scenes where the director is obviously trying to convey some emotion and feeling, but you hate the characters so much that you end up cheering.  Oh, and forget about character development, there's absolutely none to be found.Believe it or not, ""Say It Isn't So"" is plain old boring most of the time (yes, even with Heather Graham prancing around in hip huggers and bossom baring tanks).  Chris Klein talks as though he's on drugs most of the time (who knows, that may have been on purpose) and therefore says his lines with such a monotonous tone that you want to scream!  The plot is so boring and NEVER EVER motivates you or excites you in ANY way.  You end up not caring what happens to the characters.Another thing that really bugged me about this movie were the quick jumps between events.  For example, Klein's character is shipped off to Mexico on a plane while he is unconscious.  The next time you see Klein he is back in America wearing a sombrero.  How does he get back??!!  The director doesn't even bother to show us.

This hit or miss comedy is another ""There's Something About Mary"" wannabe that falls far short of that standard.  The film unquestionably has its hilarious moments, but the once funny hair lick gag has lost its luster and the film relies far too frequently on desperately crass bits that fall flat.  The sight of Chris Klein with his arm stuck in a cow's rear end is not remotely funny and to drag that bit out for ten minutes is torturously vapid.Fundamentally, the Farrellys are proving themselves to be a one trick pony with little fresh material emerging since ""Mary"" and an increased reliance on low-brow, revolting comedy to compensate for the fact that their creative tanks are apparently running on empty.  Director J.B. Rogers brings nothing new to the table, seemingly content with following the threadbare Farrelly formula.Heather Graham sparkles with a vivacious performance, despite being underutilized.  Graham's peculiar beauty and her quirky demeanor make her perfect for offbeat romantic comedy roles, and she provides a bright spot here as Klein's love interest.  Chris Klein is no dynamic actor, but his good looks and pleasantly hapless comportment are a good fit for the role.  The best comedy is provided by Orlando Jones and veterans Sally Field and Richard Jenkins, whose comic delivery and physical comedy are terrific on all counts.This film has glimmers of comedic brilliance, but far too few to make it more than another mediocre footnote on the Farrelly Brothers decaying resumes.

Boy finds out girl is not sister. Girl is engaged. Boy tries to get her back. You probably know the rest. It's not an impressive plot, and though it is a plot that is able to bring up some very funny scenes through the way, it doesn't work. The characters you don't care for and you know how it turns out.

Chris Klein bares a remarkable resemblance to Keanua Reeves. He also offers an mature and highly intelligent commenatry on the DVD (especially considering his young tender age of 22), even outshining the director. I expect huge things for Klein - he could even back up Reeves in the Matrix!What appealed to me about this movie is how such a likeable character can have so many things go wrong against the film's lead charactefr in Klien. Of note and warning , it does offer a contriversial and taboo subect with incest so it's bound to shock many people. But deep down this is a well crafted, highly spirited film with a intelligent insight voice over at the start, done by who else? Klein the man! Orlando Jones is amazing in this movie - the first time I have seen him. He provides a versatile, varied and welcome comic relief.  What puzzled me about this movie was why the millionare would pick such an ordinary girl in Heather Graham to marry, I mean she doesen't come from a rich family or anything, more dysfunctional if you ask me, but aren't we all to some extent? So that part of the film wasn't clear or developed, but who cares!? This is a movie I wouldn't mind buying 2 copies of to give as a gift. Plus the subtitles were right on track in the DVD. The only complaints I have about the film is how the Australian Region 4 version is missing the Comedy Central feature. That again shows how lucky you US DVD collectors are - you get everything. One other minor gripe. The film does get a bit silly during the middle so it ain't perfect, but more than worth your money, never the less. There was a time I was about to turn it off at the beginning in how Graham could hold a job as a totally incompetent hair dresser, but stick with it and you will be rewarded enough to guarantee the film to your friends and family.

663378,A1OH2SIJ0U46Q6,B00005LIR8,"""patsydoc""","[8, 15]","If you've seen the trailer......... you can probably figure out that this movie is about two small town lovers, Gilly and Jo (played by Chris Klein and Heather Graham), who are torn apart because everyone thinks that they are brother and sister when in fact they are not.  It's not incest....it's just a terrible case of mistaken identity!If you've seen the trailer.........you've seen every single funny scene in this film.If you've seen the trailer.........don't bother seeing the movie, it wasn't even worth the price of the discounted matinee ticket I got.Needless to say I didn't like this film much.  Chris Klein plays the same sensitive, sweet sort of guy that he's played in all his other films (i.e. ""Election"", ""American Pie"", etc.).  Heather Graham....what can I say about her.  I used to think she was cute....in a blonde doofus kind of way....but now I'm just sick of her.  Like Klein, she seems to be playing the same character over and over again...not exactly the same character of course...but you know what I mean-- the blonde doofus who's supposed to be sexy for some reason.  Personally I think she looks like an alien...her chin is too small and her eyes are too big (but that's just my totally catty opinion).  Anyway.....The only redeeming aspect of the film are the chuckles (not laughs really) that come from the interaction between Jo's (Graham's) parents played by Sally Fields and Richard Jenkins.  Jo's father is a wheelchair bound, cranky, bastard and Jo's mom is a money grubbing, white trash, leach.  There are a few gags involving these two characters that will make most people giggle, but that's about it.Don't get me wrong, there are a bunch of jokes in the movie that are pretty funny but like I said before-- almost every single big joke was given away in the trailer!  There are also a few totally disgusting gross-out scenes ala ""There's Something About Mary"" so don't be too shocked when you see Klein punch a cow in the butt and get his arm stuck in it's....well, um....you know.  Yucky?  Yes.  Funny?  Not really.Recommendation:  I'll make this really easy for you:  Don't buy this film (don't even bother renting it) if you've seen the trailer....you'll be paying for laughs that you've already been given for free AND (more importantly) you'll be wasting two hours of your life that you can never get back.  I'm sure those of you who haven't seen the trailer are asking, ""But Patsy, I haven't seen the trailer?  What should I do?"".....my response: If you have a really good sense of humor and you really want to see this movie and you can't think of anything better to do....sure, see it!
