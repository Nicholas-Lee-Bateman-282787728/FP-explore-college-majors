Dowd gets a telegram, he acts strange in talking to an invisible being. He is the sole heir to the family fortune. [An argument for the Law of Division.] The manners of that time are shown. ""The Doctor will see you in a minute."" There is a scene in a bar. A buxom singer entertains at the Dowd parlor. Aunt Ethel learns about ""Harvey"". She leaves, and so do all of her guests. Veta calls the Judge to take the needed steps. Dr. Sanderson the psychiatrist questions Veta about her brother (who visits cheap taverns). Mrs. Simmons tells him about Harvey. Who is the patient? Dr. Sanderson fears a lawsuit now! There is a conversation at cross purposes (a comedy of manners). ""He seemed like a reasonable sort of fellow."" Willy Chumley tries to straighten out the mess. What is a ""Pookah""?Veta returns home a nervous wreck. She tells what happened to her at the Rest Home. They let Elwood go. Wilson arrives to search for Elwood. ""Have you seen Harvey?"" Judge Gaffney will sue. Dr. Sanderson, Nurse Kelly, and Wilson find Elwood in Charley's Bar. They have a discussion. Where is Dr. Chumley? Elwood tells what he does in the bars. He meets people, but they leave after being told about Harvey. A frightened Dr. Chumley returns to the Rest Home. There is a conversation, Chumley now believes in Harvey. Elwood now questions Chumley, a reversal of roles. Elwood is offered serum #977 to bring him back to reality. But he prefers his fantasy. ""Don't be a fool."" The taxi driver tells what will happen after the treatment. Veta objects, so there will be a happy ending. Is it believable?This was based on a Pulitzer Prize winning stage play. Was it changed for Hollywood? What does this say about popular tastes in the late 1940s? This is a story about a decaying family that is not as wealthy as the previous generation. Elwood, the main heir, does not have a job. He spends his time visiting bars and inviting strange men back to his home. His aunt Veta has his Power of Attorney and lives in the family mansion with her unmarried daughter. There seems to be no other relatives, or they avoid them. The author created a comedy from this sad situation. Was it based on a true event? Do films still treat psychiatry as a joke today? A person who talks to an invisible being may be suffering from schizophrenia. This also raises a philosophical question.

Dowd (Jimmy Stewart), independently wealthy or at least propertied and unemployed.  His big sister Veta (the amazing Josephine Hull), and her daughter, both unemployed but UNpropertied, have to live in Elwood's big house; but this doesn't keep Veta away from social-climbing ambitions, if for no other reason to ""find a man"" for daughter Myrtle Mae (Victoria Horne). Elwood is oh-so-pleasant but for some reason Veta's society contacts don't take to Elwood's best friend, an invisible pooka (Irish spirit) who appears to Elwood in the form of a 6'3"" white rabbit.  Of course, Elwood needs to be put away because he is nuts, which will leave the house to Veta and Myrtle Mae.  Right?Thus opens HARVEY, adapted from one of Broadway's longest-running comedies that won its playwright, Mary Chase, a Pulitzer prize.  It went on to become a big hit for Universal Pictures, filmed right on their classic back lot.  HARVEY is not only funny, it's strangely affecting.  Jimmy Stewart turns in a landmark performance (here's an oxymoron): powerfully understated as the man with the best friend out of Celtic folklore, literally ""toast of the town"" because he's happy to stand everyone at Charlie's bar to beer or Martinis, even though only once in this film is he himself shown taking a drink.  You'll cheer his attempts to stay clear of the asylum despite Veta's wishes--which backfire beyond her expectations--but there is much more here.  It is simply impossible to reduce Stewart's character to just ""loveable lunatic"" or ""charming drunk"" although there are elements of that.HARVEY was a big hit for Universal Studios, and Josephine Hull, reprising her Broadway role, snagged the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.  Other notable actors include Cecil Kellaway and Jessie (""Maytag Repairman"") White.  Over the past sixtysome years HARVEY has lost none of its errant attraction, and lovers of Jimmy Stewart or pixilated film comedies will surely treasure the DVD.  The copy I here review is a budget (&lt;$10) release with no moving bells-and-whistles except for an introduction to the film by Stewart recorded decades later upon its release to VHS, but it has good strong picture quality.  I intend to view my copy again in the future, probably several times, and am quite pleased with the purchase.Comparison imdb ratings:BELL, BOOK AND CANDLE  6.8THE PHILADELPHIA STORY  8.1HARVEY  8.1",5,"""In this world you can be oh so smart or oh so pleasant . . .

Dowd - the good-natured bachelor whose best friend is a six-foot tall-plus rabbit who appears only to him. Hollywood has tried numerous times over the years to remake ""Harvey"" (most recently with Steven Spielberg expressing interest), but there's an innocence and playfulness in Henry Koster's 1950 film that's going to be impossible for anyone to recapture.

259535,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301647734,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Walking into `Harvey', I didn't really know what to expect.  I wasn't sure if this was a drama or a comedy or both.  It's both.  I think it is more of a dark comedy, one that is superficially light and cheery but that packs a wallop if you are willing to sit back and take it in for what it is `really' saying.There is definitely a darkness here.The film tells the story of Elwood P. Dowd, a drunk who has been left everything by his late mother.  He is now taking care of his eldest sister and her daughter.  Elwood's sister Veta and her daughter Myrtle Mae are at their wits end with Elwood.  You see, since moving in they have been introduced to his imaginary friend Harvey, a 6 foot, 3  inch white rabbit who seems to be Elwood's closest companion.  Elwood's outlandish behavior (in their eyes outlandish) has humiliated them for the last time.  Myrtle Mae is on the verge of becoming a spinster because of it all and so Veta finally decides to have her brother admitted to a psychiatric hospital.I think it would be safe to say that Elwood has a guardian angel by his side.The film dips into hilarity as a mix up at the hospital leaves Veta admitted and Elwood on the loose.  As the hospital attempts to rectify their mistake it becomes obvious to almost everyone that Elwood is as normal as he needs to be.The Pooka (Celtic folklore come to life) that illuminates Elwood's life is left an enigma for the audience.  It almost appears as the film draws to a close that we are to conclude he is not a mere figment but an actual reality, but then again that would almost be too easy.  The real center of this film has a lot to do with the way that we as humans deal with trauma (the loss of a loved one) and how we deal with change.  Looking at Veta and Myrtle Mae's situation, basically being cared for by a relative they deem unfit, they are reacting aggressively to the idea of change.  Their acceptance of Elwood hinges on how it will affect them, not how it is affecting Elwood.  In fact, Elwood has countless friends and is relatively happy with his life, and yet his close relatives are determined to change him to fit their needs.For me, the film almost nails it.  Some scenes seem to be a little too unfocused, but overall I was very pleased with the film.  I think that this is a film some will really enjoy and others will find preposterous and a tad corny.  It can come off rather silly at times, and the films eventual conclusion could have used a little more direction, but a sign of the times lies in the wholesome endings seen in films of this nature.That said, James Stewart's performance is impeccable.  When the film started I actually felt he was overdoing it, but as the film progressed I realized that this was that man he was portraying and all his quirks seemed natural.  Stewart was one of the greatest actors to ever grace the big screen, and this is yet further proof of that.  The character of Elwood P. Dowd is one of the best I've ever seen, truly fleshed out and entirely alive inside.  He is unique and yet relatable in all the right ways.  Thanks to Stewart's flawless performance, this delusional man (is he?) becomes someone we know and love and feel.  Josephine Hull won a deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Veta, the exasperated sister who doesn't fully understand what it is she is expecting of her innocent little brother.In the end I definitely recommend this film.  It is a great slice of entertainment with a poignant message we all do well to pay attention to.",4,"Oh, so pleasant...",1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,3506,"['Walking', 'Harvey', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'drama', 'comedy', 'think', 'more', 'dark', 'comedy', 'one', 'superficially', 'light', 'cheery', 'wallop', 'are', 'willing', 'sit', 'back', 'take', 'what', 'really', 'saying.There', 'definitely', 'darkness', 'here.The', 'film', 'story', 'Elwood', 'P.', 'Dowd', 'drunk', 'who', 'been', 'left', 'everything', 'late', 'mother', 'now', 'taking', 'care', 'eldest', 'sister', 'daughter', 'Elwood', 'sister', 'Veta', 'daughter', 'Myrtle', 'Mae', 'are', 'wits', 'end', 'Elwood', 'see', 'moving', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Harvey', '6', 'foot', '3', 'inch', 'white', 'rabbit', 'who', 'be', 'Elwood', 'closest', 'companion', 'Elwood', 'outlandish', 'behavior', 'eyes', 'outlandish', 'humiliated', 'last', 'time', 'Myrtle', 'Mae', 'verge', 'becoming', 'spinster', 'so', 'Veta', 'finally', 'have', 'brother', 'admitted', 'psychiatric', 'hospital.I', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'safe', 'say', 'Elwood', 'guardian', 'angel', 'side.The', 'film', 'dips', 'hilarity', 'mix', 'up', 'hospital', 'Veta', 'admitted', 'Elwood', 'loose', 'hospital', 'attempts', 'rectify', 'mistake', 'obvious', 'almost', 'everyone', 'Elwood', 'as', 'normal', 'be.The', 'Pooka', 'Celtic', 'folklore', 'come', 'life', 'Elwood', 'life', 'left', 'enigma', 'audience', 'almost', 'film', 'close', 'are', 'conclude', 'not', 'mere', 'figment', 'actual', 'reality', 'then', 'again', 'would', 'almost', 'be', 'too', 'easy', 'real', 'center', 'film', 'lot', 'do', 'way', 'humans', 'deal', 'trauma', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'how', 'deal', 'change', 'Looking', 'Veta', 'Myrtle', 'Mae', 'situation', 'basically', 'being', 'cared', 'relative', 'deem', 'unfit', 'are', 'reacting', 'aggressively', 'idea', 'change', 'acceptance', 'Elwood', 'hinges', 'how', 'will', 'affect', 'not', 'how', 'affecting', 'Elwood', 'fact', 'Elwood', 'countless', 'friends', 'relatively', 'happy', 'life', 'yet', 'close', 'relatives', 'are', 'determined', 'change', 'fit', 'needs.For', 'film', 'almost', 'scenes', 'seem', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'unfocused', 'overall', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'film', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'preposterous', 'tad', 'corny', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'rather', 'silly', 'times', 'films', 'eventual', 'conclusion', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'direction', 'sign', 'times', 'wholesome', 'endings', 'seen', 'films', 'said', 'James', 'Stewart', 'performance', 'impeccable', 'When', 'film', 'started', 'actually', 'felt', 'was', 'overdoing', 'film', 'progressed', 'realized', 'was', 'man', 'was', 'portraying', 'quirks', 'seemed', 'natural', 'Stewart', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'ever', 'grace', 'big', 'screen', 'yet', 'further', 'proof', 'character', 'Elwood', 'P.', 'Dowd', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'truly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'entirely', 'alive', 'inside', 'unique', 'yet', 'relatable', 'right', 'ways', 'Thanks', 'Stewart', 'flawless', 'performance', 'delusional', 'man', 'someone', 'know', 'love', 'feel', 'Josephine', 'Hull', 'won', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Veta', 'exasperated', 'sister', 'who', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'expecting', 'innocent', 'little', 'end', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'great', 'slice', 'entertainment', 'poignant', 'message', 'do', 'well', 'pay', 'attention']",N/A
259536,A3759QIB6KMQZ2,6301647734,"Anthony Paul ""AP""","[10, 11]","I have been aware of ""Harvey"" for several years now, but had never actually seen it until I purchased this DVD.  Of course with Jimmy Stewart in the lead role,  my expectations were understandably high to begin with.  I'm pleased to inform that this film doesn't fail to deliver.  ****The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name.  The play, written by Mary Chase ( who also helped with the screenplay), was written as a gift to help cheer a friend who lost a son in WW2.  It translates wonderfully to the medium of film, largely due to the fact that most of the actors who appeared in the Broadway version were re-cast in their roles.  Historically, this was not usually done in Hollywood.  The film itself is ""staged"" very much like a play, with many long-shots, and is very engaging. ** Most surprising to me was the comedy.  I expected it to be cute and charming, and as humorous as any 53 yr-old film could be.  However this film isn't just a cutesy fairytale. I was very surprised and delighed with some of the situations and subject matter...HILARIOUS...some of which might have been considered a little bawdy back in 1950.  This material has aged wonderfully. **  The cast is marvelous as well.  Although Stewart felt that he portrayed his character a little too cute and dreamy,  I found this to be one of his finest performances.  He fills the cute and ""crazy"" character of Elwood P. Dowd with depth, wit, and more than a touch of pathos.  And such was always the genious of Stewart...to have the ability to create a character that, no matter what, the world would welcome as a friend.  He was a remarkable talent and has left a unfillable void with his passing.  **Also remarkable is the performance of Josephine Hull who won the Academy Award for her role.  I had never heard of nor seen her in anything before, so this was a real treat.  Simply put, she is hilarious throughout the film.  All in all, this is a highly enjoyable story that can certainly be enjoyed at face value, and/or can be used as a parable with a greater moral value.******About the DVD******  Although the film doesn't appear to have undergone a complete restoration as such before its transfer to DVD, whatever film elements were used for the transfer seem to be in great shape.  For the most part, the picture is crisp with a good greyscale and minimal artifacts.  The sound is 2 channel mono (2.0) and is adequate for a film of this age.  As far as bonus material, while it would always be nice to have more, there are some fairly interesting production notes, and the cast bios.  The best bonus however is a photo montage accompanied by a more recently recorded (1990) introduction by Jimmy Stewart.  While it is informative, it's real value lies in just hearing Stewart speak, that familiar drawl...aged, yet still the voice of everyman.

Where is he indeed! I wanna see the damned rabbit, too!  Yet this thought-provoking parable about what is real and what isn't and the shades of each we use to try to live our lives as best we can, remains one of the all-time favorites of people who love to watch movies.James Stewart portrays Elwin P. Dowd as a more than slightly-tipsy drinker who happens to enjoy the company of his constant company Harvey, a six-foot- something invisible (and imaginary?)  rabbit. Now all of the terrific character actors in the film are of one opinion or another about the rabbit, but all agree that Dowd is an altogether pleasant man who everyone enjoys having around. Yet his incessant and insistent ramblings about Harvey make him an embarrassment, and some of them are honestly concerned about him. So what to do about Elwin? And what do you think about the rabbit?As for me, I prefer to think the rabbit is real, but chooses to be invisible. More interesting that way. And you have to admit the porch swing does rock without anyone else on it in the last scene, after all. I've tried the rabbit routine a few times when in a particularly whimsical mood, and it always brings smiles and conversation.

Dowd, a gentle philosopher and harmless alcoholic who, after his mother's death, befriends an imaginary - or is he? - 6'3.5"" white rabbit; a ""Pooka"" who goes by the name of Harvey. Unfortunately, it seems that Harvey is invisible to everyone but Elwood. Elwood wanders through life perfectly happy, harming no one, but alienating his family and many of the townspeople with his ""friend"".Josephine Hull, (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in the film; she also played the part on stage) portrays his sister Veta Louise Simmons, and she steals the film, IMO; her facial expressions and gestures are priceless (she also played one of the aunts in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"", 1944).The pacing is fast and furious, and the dialogue alternately hilarious and touching in this whimsical, bittersweet tale of illusions and realities. Jimmy Stewart found himself personally identified with the role for many years, much to his delight, remarking in interviews how strangers would sometimes stop him in the street and seriously ask him if Harvey were with him, only to be kindly told, ""No, he's at home today, with a slight cold"" or some other humoring excuse for the lack of his invisible friend.Of course the movie is dated and implausible today in several respects; however it still holds a gentle, childlike appeal that transcends time.

This is such a heartwarming and hilarious film. It's definately one of my favorites.It tells the story of a man named Elwood P.

Meanwhile, his sister and niece find him an embarrassing nuicance who is standing in the way of his niece, Myrtle May's, introduction into high-class society. However, Elwood seems oblivious to their behavior towards him and never has anything but a kind word for anyone. Everyone outside his family seems to adore him and his family would love him too if it wasn't for his best friend. A best friend that no one can see. Except Elwood. A 6-foot-tall white rabbit named Harvey. As Elwood goes throughout his day, inviting bums from bars back to their fancy home for dinner, buying people he doesn't even know countless drinks, and giving them his card before introducing them to Harvey, his sister finally decides that that's the last straw and she decides to get rid of him. So she goes to a mental institution to begin the process of having him admitted. And that's where all their problems really begin...This is a wonderful movie that my entire family makes a ritual of watching at least a couple times a year.

259561,AEVNUEDRGTC4P,6301647734,Charles J. Rector,"[4, 6]","During the past decade, Hollywood has shown a strong tendency to do movie remakes. Additionally, plans are in the works for many more remakes in the near future. A few of these remakes are either just as good as the original or in rare cases even better than the original. Most remakes are worse than the original and are all too often just plain awful in their own right.There are some movies that are just about perfect in their original form and as such should never, ever be subjected to the remaking process. One such flick is the 1950 classic Harvey starring James Stewart as Elwood P. Dowd. As to who plays the title role, that is a good question.You see, title role is played, at least according to Elwood P. Dowd, by a six foot eight inches tall rabbit named Harvey who is invisible to everyone except Dowd. Dowd is a barroom regular who drinks with Harvey every day and opens doors for his rabbit friend who Dowd refers to as being a ""pooka."" Only problem is that Dowd is the only person who has ever seen Harvey.Dowd's relationship with Harvey is most embarrassing for the other members of his family who think that he has flipped his lid. Chief among these relatives is Dowd's sister Veta Louise Simmons (Josephine Hull) who has been assiduosly trying to get her beloved daughter Myrtle Mae Simmons (Victoria Horne) married off. Everytime Dowd talks to Harvey in the presence of a suitor to Myrtle Mae has the effect of scaring off the suitor who thinks that the family is nuts. The same goes for whenever Veta Louise Simmons has a tea party for other older age ladies. This is especially important since these parties are meant to introduce Myrtle Mae Simmons to the mothers and aunts of prospective suitors with the idea being that if the society matrons approve of her, they will talk to their sons and/or nephews about the idea of getting married to the younger Simmons female.After a party in which Veta Louise Simmons tried to introduce her daughter to prospective suitors went up in smoke after Elwood P. Dowd showed up and brought Harvey with him and introduced Harvey to the guests, Veta Louise decides that she has had enough. She goes to Dr. Chumley's Rest Sanatorioum and endeavors to have Elwood committed there. However, due to her behavior when she gets flustered and a mixup on the part of the staff, Veta winds up getting committed herself! Eventually, things get sorted out and then Dr. Chumley decides to go after Elwood himself.Harvey is a movie masterpiece of the first order. It is well done in just about every respect. It is also a model family movie outside of Elwood's tendency to drink at bars and the fact that there is some unnecessary violence. Harvey contains plenty of slapstick and screwball humor however, unlike most movies of the type, it is very well thought out. If you want a movie for the whole family, then Harvey is a movie well worth considering.",5,Harvey:  A Movie Classic That Never Should Be Remade,1146787200,"05 5, 2006",2006,2901,"['past', 'decade', 'Hollywood', 'shown', 'strong', 'tendency', 'do', 'movie', 'remakes', 'Additionally', 'plans', 'are', 'works', 'many', 'more', 'remakes', 'near', 'future', 'few', 'remakes', 'are', 'either', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'rare', 'cases', 'even', 'better', 'original', 'Most', 'remakes', 'are', 'worse', 'original', 'are', 'too', 'often', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'own', 'right.There', 'are', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'perfect', 'original', 'form', 'such', 'should', 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'subjected', 'remaking', 'process', 'One', 'such', 'flick', '1950', 'classic', 'Harvey', 'starring', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Elwood', 'P.', 'Dowd', 'who', 'title', 'role', 'good', 'question.You', 'see', 'title', 'role', 'played', 'least', 'according', 'Elwood', 'P.', 'Dowd', 'six', 'foot', 'eight', 'inches', 'tall', 'rabbit', 'named', 'Harvey', 'who', 'invisible', 'everyone', 'Dowd', 'Dowd', 'barroom', 'regular', 'who', 'Harvey', 'day', 'doors', 'rabbit', 'friend', 'who', 'refers', 'being', 'pooka', 'Only', 'problem', 'Dowd', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'Harvey.Dowd', 'relationship', 'Harvey', 'most', 'embarrassing', 'other', 'members', 'family', 'who', 'think', 'flipped', 'lid', 'Chief', 'relatives', 'Dowd', 'sister', 'Veta', 'Louise', 'Simmons', 'Josephine', 'Hull', 'who', 'been', 'assiduosly', 'trying', 'get', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'Myrtle', 'Mae', 'Simmons', 'Victoria', 'Horne', 'married', 'off', 'Everytime', 'Dowd', 'talks', 'Harvey', 'presence', 'suitor', 'Myrtle', 'Mae', 'effect', 'scaring', 'off', 'suitor', 'who', 'family', 'nuts', 'same', 'whenever', 'Veta', 'Louise', 'Simmons', 'tea', 'party', 'other', 'older', 'age', 'ladies', 'especially', 'important', 'parties', 'are', 'meant', 'introduce', 'Myrtle', 'Mae', 'Simmons', 'mothers', 'aunts', 'prospective', 'suitors', 'idea', 'being', 'society', 'matrons', 'will', 'talk', 'sons', 'nephews', 'idea', 'getting', 'married', 'younger', 'Simmons', 'female.After', 'party', 'Veta', 'Louise', 'Simmons', 'tried', 'introduce', 'daughter', 'prospective', 'suitors', 'went', 'up', 'smoke', 'Elwood', 'P.', 'Dowd', 'showed', 'up', 'brought', 'Harvey', 'introduced', 'Harvey', 'guests', 'Veta', 'Louise', 'had', 'enough', 'Dr.', 'Chumley', 'Rest', 'Sanatorioum', 'endeavors', 'have', 'Elwood', 'committed', 'there', 'However', 'due', 'behavior', 'when', 'flustered', 'mixup', 'part', 'staff', 'Veta', 'up', 'getting', 'committed', 'Eventually', 'things', 'get', 'sorted', 'out', 'then', 'Dr.', 'Chumley', 'go', 'Elwood', 'himself.Harvey', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'first', 'order', 'well', 'done', 'just', 'respect', 'also', 'model', 'family', 'movie', 'Elwood', 'tendency', 'drink', 'bars', 'fact', 'unnecessary', 'violence', 'Harvey', 'plenty', 'slapstick', 'screwball', 'humor', 'however', 'most', 'movies', 'type', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'want', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'then', 'Harvey', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'considering']",N/A

He is gentle, charming, kind, sweet, generous, gregarious, and he will buy you a drink, or invite you to dinner within two seconds after just meeting you.  He loves life, and loves to enjoy every minute of it.  He likes martinis, good conversations and fresh flowers. He wants to introduce everyone he meets to his best friend, Harvey, who is constantly at his side.  The only problem is that ""Harvey"" is a six foot eight inch rabbit who is only visible to him.Fearing that Elwood has lost his mind, and tiring of being socially outcast because of her brother's ""imaginary friend"", his sister Veta-Louise,decides to have him committed to a mental hospital.  Distraught when she brought him in, the doctor in attendance is convinced that she is the one who needs treatment, so he  locks her up instead and sets Elwood free.  Realizing their mistake, the hospital staff go on a frantic search for Elwood and ""Harvey"", and along the way, they learn valuable lessons about themselves...and life.James Stewart not only portrays Elwood P Dowd, he becomes Elwood P Dowd.Josephine Hull, who plays Elwood's oft worried and frantic sister, Veta-Louise, reprises her critically acclaimed role from the original Broadway play.  Another big plus for this film is that Stewart and Hull are backed by a fine ensemble of supporting players, whose performances deserve a nod of appreciation as well.To put it bluntly, reality is overrated, and Harvey is a pure delight.  This gem of a film is a treasure that belongs in every classic movie lovers collection.Cast-Elwood P Dowd--------James StewartVeta Louise Simmons--Josephine HullMyrtle Mae-----------Victoria HorneDr. Chumley----------Cecil KellawayDr Sanderson---------Charles DrakeNurse Kelly----------Peggy DowJudge Gaffney--------William LynnWilson---------------Jesse WhiteTaxi Driver----------Wallace FordHarvey---------------Himself",5,Victory Over Reality,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,2048,"['Released', '1950', 'directed', 'Henry', 'Koster', 'Harvey', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'original', 'hit', 'Broadway', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'written', 'Mary', 'Chase.Meet', 'Elwood', 'P', 'Dowd', 'gentle', 'charming', 'kind', 'sweet', 'generous', 'gregarious', 'will', 'buy', 'drink', 'invite', 'dinner', 'two', 'seconds', 'just', 'meeting', 'life', 'enjoy', 'minute', 'martinis', 'good', 'conversations', 'fresh', 'flowers', 'introduce', 'everyone', 'best', 'friend', 'Harvey', 'who', 'constantly', 'side', 'only', 'problem', 'Harvey', 'six', 'foot', 'eight', 'inch', 'rabbit', 'who', 'only', 'visible', 'him.Fearing', 'Elwood', 'lost', 'mind', 'tiring', 'being', 'socially', 'outcast', 'brother', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'sister', 'Veta-Louise', 'have', 'committed', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Distraught', 'when', 'brought', 'doctor', 'attendance', 'convinced', 'one', 'who', 'treatment', 'up', 'instead', 'sets', 'Elwood', 'free', 'Realizing', 'mistake', 'hospital', 'staff', 'go', 'frantic', 'search', 'Elwood', 'Harvey', 'way', 'learn', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'life.James', 'Stewart', 'not', 'only', 'Elwood', 'P', 'Dowd', 'Elwood', 'P', 'Dowd.Josephine', 'Hull', 'who', 'Elwood', 'oft', 'worried', 'frantic', 'sister', 'Veta-Louise', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'role', 'original', 'Broadway', 'play', 'big', 'plus', 'film', 'Stewart', 'Hull', 'are', 'backed', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'supporting', 'players', 'performances', 'deserve', 'nod', 'appreciation', 'well.To', 'put', 'bluntly', 'reality', 'overrated', 'Harvey', 'pure', 'delight', 'gem', 'film', 'treasure', 'classic', 'movie', 'lovers', 'collection.Cast-Elwood', 'P', 'Dowd', 'James', 'StewartVeta', 'Louise', 'Simmons', 'Josephine', 'HullMyrtle', 'Mae', '-Victoria', 'HorneDr', 'Chumley', 'Cecil', 'KellawayDr', 'Sanderson', '-Charles', 'DrakeNurse', 'Kelly', 'Peggy', 'DowJudge', 'Gaffney', 'William', 'LynnWilson', '-Jesse', 'WhiteTaxi', 'Driver', 'Wallace', 'FordHarvey']",N/A

On the surface it can be characterized as a screwball comedy about an iconoclast and his imaginary 6 foot 8 rabbit friend.  Sure the film has scads of hilarity.  What impressed me was it's sensitivity towards the mentally ill.  Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart) is a genial sort but it's apparent that he is most definitely delusional and probably alcoholic.  1950 was not exactly the most politically correct of times but Mary Chase's Pulitizer Prize winning play from which the film's script is based is unusally in tune with the problems that people with mental illness face and it does so with great subtlety.  For that reason the film 58 years on does not date at all.  Stewart gives one of his patented great performances, a turn that is at once understated and sympathetic.  Josephine Hull deservingly won the Oscar for her work as Elwood's harried sister Veda, a role which in lesser hands could have bordered on the cliche.  For sure ""Harvey"" is mainly a comedy but it transcends mere labeling.

259574,A27ZOCD5B63Y0P,6301647734,"D. Collier ""Shelf-Help""","[1, 2]","That's right, you can't have too many friends.  Or at least, that's what Elwood P. Dowd quips to his sister, Veta Louise, as he invites a total stranger (a taxi driver this time, earlier he invited Mr. Meegles the excon, Dr. Sanderson the psychiatrist, Miss Kelly the nurse, Mrs. Chumley the wife of the head of the insane asylum, and Mr. Shimmelplusser who works the security gate at the asylum) over to their house for dinner.  Many fans and film critics refer to Dowd as an alcoholic, and any psychologist worth his salt probably would also when they witness Dowd's nonchalant conversations with his best friend Harvey -- the 6-foot (&quot;6-foot-3-and-a-half, now let's stick to the facts.&quot;) invisible rabbit.  Interestingly though, I read the other day that throughout the course of the movie, you never see Elwood Dowd consume any alcohol at all.We really don't know what Elwood would be like if the rabbit were not in the picture, although a character in the film gives us a few hints of what it would be like (but I won't spoil that part for you).  Probably, it is the rabbit that makes Elwood the poster child for HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE.  Elwood is the kind of person you would love to be friends with.  He's the kind of person who would rather hear you talk about yourself than bore (or perhaps intrigue) you with all the details of his own life.  When it comes time to thank or compliment a person, Elwood does it in full force.  Elwood is not easily angered or offended.  In fact, the plot of the movie revolves around Elwood's sister Veta Louise trying to have him committed.  When Elwood officially discovers this (personally, I think he knew it all the time), instead of being indignant and angry, he compliments her strength and energy.  After that, he is asked whether or not he has any righteous indignation, to which he replies that his mother always used to tell him that&quot;in this world...you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.  Well, for years I was smart; I recommend pleasant.  And you may quote me.&quot;The acting in this film is entirely top notch throughout, right down to Mr. Cracker the bartender (who only had one or two lines).  Josephine Hull even won a Best Actress Oscar for her brilliant portrayal of Veta Louise Simmons.  And remember, this was back in the days when winning an Oscar actually meant something!  I was recently asked who I think is the best female performance I've ever seen in a movie.  I had totally forgotten about Josephine Hull, but now, I'd like to go on record saying the hers was by far the very best I have ever seen.You can think of this as a comedy, and that is certainly how it is catgorized.  But this is also a sweet and tender story about the joys and values of friendship(s).Although this is one of my all-time favorite movies, I have had to put off reviewing it because I'm afraid my review may not do this great movie any justice.  So, if you read the review and then have low expectations of this film, then, please, blame me and watch the movie anyway!",5,YOU CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MANY FRIENDS,1055980800,"06 19, 2003",2003,3053,"['right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'many', 'friends', 'least', 'what', 'Elwood', 'P.', 'Dowd', 'sister', 'Veta', 'Louise', 'total', 'stranger', 'taxi', 'driver', 'time', 'earlier', 'invited', 'Mr.', 'Meegles', 'excon', 'Dr.', 'Sanderson', 'psychiatrist', 'Miss', 'Kelly', 'nurse', 'Mrs.', 'Chumley', 'wife', 'head', 'insane', 'asylum', 'Mr.', 'Shimmelplusser', 'who', 'security', 'gate', 'asylum', 'house', 'dinner', 'Many', 'fans', 'film', 'critics', 'refer', 'Dowd', 'alcoholic', 'psychologist', 'salt', 'probably', 'would', 'also', 'when', 'witness', 'Dowd', 'nonchalant', 'conversations', 'best', 'friend', 'Harvey', '6-foot', 'quot', '6-foot-3-and-a-half', 'now', 'let', 'stick', 'facts.', 'quot', 'invisible', 'rabbit', 'Interestingly', 'read', 'other', 'day', 'course', 'movie', 'never', 'see', 'Elwood', 'Dowd', 'alcohol', 'all.We', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Elwood', 'would', 'be', 'rabbit', 'were', 'not', 'picture', 'character', 'film', 'few', 'hints', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'part', 'Probably', 'rabbit', 'Elwood', 'poster', 'child', 'HOW', 'TO', 'WIN', 'FRIENDS', 'AND', 'INFLUENCE', 'PEOPLE', 'Elwood', 'kind', 'person', 'would', 'love', 'be', 'friends', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'hear', 'talk', 'bore', 'perhaps', 'intrigue', 'details', 'own', 'life', 'When', 'time', 'thank', 'compliment', 'person', 'Elwood', 'full', 'force', 'Elwood', 'not', 'easily', 'angered', 'offended', 'fact', 'plot', 'movie', 'around', 'Elwood', 'sister', 'Veta', 'Louise', 'trying', 'have', 'committed', 'When', 'Elwood', 'officially', 'personally', 'think', 'knew', 'time', 'instead', 'being', 'indignant', 'angry', 'strength', 'energy', 'asked', 'not', 'righteous', 'indignation', 'mother', 'always', 'used', 'tell', 'quot', 'world', 'must', 'be', 'oh', 'so', 'smart', 'oh', 'so', 'pleasant', 'Well', 'years', 'was', 'smart', 'recommend', 'pleasant', 'may', 'quote', 'me.', 'quot', 'acting', 'film', 'entirely', 'top', 'notch', 'right', 'down', 'Mr.', 'Cracker', 'bartender', 'who', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'two', 'lines', 'Josephine', 'Hull', 'even', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'Veta', 'Louise', 'Simmons', 'remember', 'was', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'actually', 'meant', 'something', 'was', 'recently', 'asked', 'who', 'think', 'best', 'female', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'had', 'totally', 'forgotten', 'Josephine', 'Hull', 'now', ""'d"", 'like', 'go', 'record', 'saying', 'hers', 'was', 'far', 'very', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.You', 'can', 'think', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'how', 'catgorized', 'also', 'sweet', 'tender', 'story', 'joys', 'values', 'friendship', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'have', 'had', 'put', 'off', 'reviewing', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'review', 'may', 'not', 'do', 'great', 'movie', 'justice', 'So', 'read', 'review', 'then', 'have', 'low', 'expectations', 'film', 'then', 'please', 'blame', 'watch', 'movie', 'anyway']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 1]","&#34;Well, I've wrestled with reality for 35 years, doctor, and I'm happy to state I finally won out over it.&#34;That cheerful comment sets the tone for &#34;Harvey,&#34; a movie about a lovable guy whose way of dealing with the harshness of reality is simple: Make his own. James Stewart has never been as enchantingly charming as he is here, sunnily drifting through an increasingly frantic knot of people whose lives are changed by his invisible rabbit.Veta Louise Simmons (Josephine Hull) hopes to arrange a wonderful marriage for daughter Myrtle May (Victoria Horne) in the upper echelons of society. There's one problem: her wealthy brother Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart) has an imaginary pal, a six-foot-three rabbit called Harvey. After Elwood accidently wrecks a party by introducing Harvey to everyone, Veta decides to have him committed.Unfortunately, when Veta takes Elwood to the sanatorium, the staff come to think that the fluttery socialite is crazy, and is trying to get her sunny brother out of the way. So they lock her up, and let him go. After that mistake is straightened out, the psychiatric staff and Elwood's long-suffering family try to find him.... and Harvey.If we ever saw Elwood P. Dowd (&#34;Here, let me give you one of my cards&#34;) in a car, the bumper sticker would probably say, &#34;Reality is highly overrated.&#34; The big theme of the movie is that reality can be harsh, and that it's not necessarily a bad thing to lapse out of it into the fantasies of our own minds. If Elwood isn't dangerous and is otherwise normal, who cares if he has an imaginary friend?Is Harvey real? The film leaves that up to our imaginations. And in the end, it doesn't matter if Harvey is a figment of Elwood's imagination, or a friendly spirit. It's the effect he has on Elwood that is important. His presence makes Elwood happy and relaxed, and Elwood makes others happy and relaxed -- even the hard-boiled head of the psychiatric ward, who lies down on his own couch and tells his secrets to Elwood.This actually isn't too screwballish a comedy -- sure, there's the running joke where Elwood politely introduces Harvey to people he meets. And the scene where Veta is committed is hilarious. But it's more of a heartwarmer than a comedy, from Elwood softening the lead shrink to Myrtle May finding love with a lovable blue-collar worker from the sanatorium.James Stewart gives a wonderfully dreamy performance, slightly smelling of booze and flowers -- his Elwood P. Dowd is mild-mannered, sweet, gallant, courteous, and oh-so-pleasant. And he's learned the value of just enjoying the little things in life, like a flower, a beer or a talk with a friend.

259587,A1JY32VVKRTGQZ,6301647734,"Emily ""Em's Joie de Weird""","[1, 1]","The first time I saw HARVEY, I enjoyed it very much as a charming comedy with a touch of fantasy.  In a nutshell, it's about a guy named Elwood P. Dowd who keeps company with a giant, invisible rabbit named Harvey.  His sister and her daughter think he's nuts,  and his behavior is seriously cramping their style with the society folk in town.  His sister decides he should be committed to the local sanitarium so she and her daughter can get on with their lives.  But her attempts to put him away have unexpected results.I like this movie so much, I've seen it at least a dozen times over the past decade.  As I got older, I began to realize that the movie struck me a little differently every time I saw it.  New layers are exposed with each viewing - and finally I understood that under all that light-hearted whimsy, HARVEY is the story of a shattered man.Jimmy Stewart played Elwood P. Dowd, Harvey's best buddy, in both the movie and the  stage version.  I doubt anyone else could have nailed the role.  Stewart is an essential American character, very much a product of his place and time.  He raises his voice when he's irritated or excited, but when he's truly angered or troubled, his voice becomes quieter.  As Elwood, he's unfailingly kind and courteous, so people respond to him warmly.  Elwood is so likeable, some people even continue to like him after he introduces them to the invisible rabbit.Elwood is younger than his sister, and their elderly mother doted on him.  She left the entire estate to him when she passed away, which is another reason his sister feels she has to wrest Power of Attorney from him.  He likes to invite people to supper at the home he shares with his sister and niece, regardless of who they are or how long he's known them (usually just a few minutes).  He is oblivious to class, race, religion, or any other social distinction, and in that time and place that's just plain awkward.  Elwood seems innocent, perhaps a bit simple, and childlike in his reaction to people.But if you really listen to him, you realize this is far from the case.  Before his mother died, Elwood used to be a different man.  As a member of the upper class, he moved among movers and shakers.  But something seems to have snapped in him.  He quotes his mother a lot, and one wonders if her death was a blow from which he couldn't completely recover.  His remarks also indicate a sense of futility in the pursuit of money, status,  and power.  After all, what good is any of that when the person you loved most in the world is gone?  His recovery from this loss is fragile, but something unexpected has come along to help him hold it together: Harvey the pookah becomes his friend, confidant, and drinking buddy.According to the movie, Pookahs are Celtic spirits with an odd sense of humor.  As the story begins to unfold, we find out that pookahs aren't just fun-loving, they have interesting powers, too.  For instance, they can stop time.  If they really like someone, they have a protective streak, too.  Elwood needs that protection, because the misguided doctor in the movie believes the only way to shock Elwood back into a normal life is to give him a chemical lobotomy in the form of a drug.  If HARVEY were just about this dreadful injection, it would be a horror movie.  Before the whole thing is over, you wonder if sweet, kind-hearted Elwood won't be shattered for good.The story in HARVEY works on multiple levels, and that alone would make it a good movie.  But it also has a marvelous cast, and their deft performances are unforgettable.  A less skilled actor than Stewart might have overplayed Elwood's simplicity, or camped up the whole invisible rabbit thing.  Instead, Stewart plays the part not only with perfect comic timing, but also with a subtlety that allows you to understand Elwood's character once you really start to listen.  The dark undercurrent in Elwood's life reminds me of a heart-breaking scene in the movie IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, another story that's often described as too sugary and feel-good.  Anyone who describes it that way must not have seen the scene in which Stewart's character George Bailey, at the end of his rope after a large sum of money has disappeared, prays desperately to God for help.  When God answers the prayer, it's not with an instant fix (Here's the money, pal - good luck!).  Instead, he finds a way to let George know his life matters to people, that he's not alone.Harvey finds a way to do that for Elwood, too.  By the end of the movie, you realize that Elwood and Harvey probably have the best approach to life after all.  And that's why HARVEY is another permanent resident of my Best Movies list.",5,"There's More To Harvey Than The Giant, Invisible Rabbit",1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,4688,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'HARVEY', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'charming', 'comedy', 'touch', 'fantasy', 'nutshell', 'guy', 'named', 'Elwood', 'P.', 'Dowd', 'who', 'company', 'giant', 'invisible', 'rabbit', 'named', 'Harvey', 'sister', 'daughter', 'think', 'nuts', 'behavior', 'seriously', 'cramping', 'style', 'society', 'folk', 'town', 'sister', 'should', 'be', 'committed', 'local', 'sanitarium', 'daughter', 'can', 'get', 'lives', 'attempts', 'put', 'away', 'have', 'unexpected', 'results.I', 'movie', 'so', 'much', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'past', 'decade', 'got', 'older', 'began', 'realize', 'movie', 'struck', 'little', 'differently', 'time', 'saw', 'New', 'layers', 'are', 'exposed', 'viewing', 'finally', 'understood', 'light-hearted', 'whimsy', 'HARVEY', 'story', 'shattered', 'man.Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'played', 'Elwood', 'P.', 'Dowd', 'Harvey', 'best', 'buddy', 'movie', 'stage', 'version', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'nailed', 'role', 'Stewart', 'essential', 'American', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'product', 'place', 'time', 'voice', 'when', 'irritated', 'excited', 'when', 'truly', 'angered', 'troubled', 'voice', 'quieter', 'Elwood', 'unfailingly', 'kind', 'courteous', 'so', 'people', 'respond', 'warmly', 'Elwood', 'so', 'likeable', 'people', 'even', 'continue', 'like', 'invisible', 'rabbit.Elwood', 'younger', 'sister', 'elderly', 'mother', 'doted', 'left', 'entire', 'estate', 'when', 'passed', 'away', 'reason', 'sister', 'feels', 'wrest', 'Power', 'Attorney', 'invite', 'people', 'supper', 'home', 'shares', 'sister', 'niece', 'regardless', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'long', 'known', 'usually', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'oblivious', 'class', 'race', 'religion', 'other', 'social', 'distinction', 'time', 'place', 'just', 'plain', 'awkward', 'Elwood', 'innocent', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'simple', 'childlike', 'reaction', 'people.But', 'really', 'listen', 'realize', 'far', 'case', 'mother', 'died', 'Elwood', 'used', 'be', 'different', 'man', 'member', 'upper', 'class', 'moved', 'movers', 'shakers', 'something', 'have', 'snapped', 'mother', 'lot', 'one', 'wonders', 'death', 'was', 'blow', 'could', ""n't"", 'completely', 'recover', 'remarks', 'also', 'indicate', 'sense', 'futility', 'pursuit', 'money', 'status', 'power', 'what', 'good', 'when', 'person', 'loved', 'most', 'world', 'gone', 'recovery', 'loss', 'fragile', 'something', 'unexpected', 'come', 'help', 'hold', 'together', 'Harvey', 'pookah', 'friend', 'confidant', 'drinking', 'buddy.According', 'movie', 'Pookahs', 'are', 'Celtic', 'spirits', 'odd', 'sense', 'humor', 'story', 'unfold', 'find', 'out', 'pookahs', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'fun-loving', 'have', 'interesting', 'powers', 'too', 'instance', 'can', 'stop', 'time', 'really', 'someone', 'have', 'protective', 'streak', 'too', 'Elwood', 'protection', 'misguided', 'doctor', 'movie', 'only', 'way', 'shock', 'Elwood', 'back', 'normal', 'life', 'give', 'chemical', 'lobotomy', 'form', 'drug', 'HARVEY', 'were', 'just', 'dreadful', 'injection', 'would', 'be', 'horror', 'movie', 'whole', 'thing', 'over', 'wonder', 'sweet', 'kind-hearted', 'Elwood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'shattered', 'good.The', 'story', 'HARVEY', 'works', 'multiple', 'levels', 'alone', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'also', 'marvelous', 'cast', 'deft', 'performances', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'less', 'skilled', 'actor', 'Stewart', 'might', 'have', 'overplayed', 'Elwood', 'simplicity', 'camped', 'up', 'whole', 'invisible', 'rabbit', 'thing', 'Instead', 'Stewart', 'part', 'not', 'only', 'perfect', 'comic', 'timing', 'also', 'subtlety', 'understand', 'Elwood', 'character', 'once', 'really', 'start', 'listen', 'dark', 'undercurrent', 'Elwood', 'life', 'heart-breaking', 'scene', 'movie', 'IT', 'A', 'WONDERFUL', 'LIFE', 'story', 'often', 'described', 'too', 'sugary', 'feel-good', 'Anyone', 'who', 'way', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'scene', 'Stewart', 'character', 'George', 'Bailey', 'end', 'rope', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'disappeared', 'desperately', 'God', 'help', 'When', 'God', 'prayer', 'not', 'instant', 'fix', 'Here', 'money', 'pal', 'good', 'luck', 'Instead', 'way', 'let', 'George', 'know', 'life', 'matters', 'people', 'not', 'alone.Harvey', 'way', 'do', 'Elwood', 'too', 'end', 'movie', 'realize', 'Elwood', 'Harvey', 'probably', 'have', 'best', 'approach', 'life', 'why', 'HARVEY', 'permanent', 'resident', 'Best', 'Movies', 'list']",N/A

I won't spoil your viewing experience by revealing if Harvey is real or not and hence I'll let you find it out yourself but this film is a good example of a good play very successfully being made into a movie which doesn't always happen e.g. ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" which suffered greatly from this treatment.  The film starts out a little slow as it meticulously builds up all the characters but it picks up about 45 minutes through and more than redeems itself by the end.  As the jokes don't age very well, I'd hesitate to call this a comedy for modern day viewers but the term ""light-hearted"" is probably the best adjective to describe this overall entertaining film.The problem lies with the DVD which hasn't been restored and so suffers greatly from poor picture quality.  Imperfections and white dots proliferate throughout and the sound quality is also poor.  After about half an hour of viewing, the volume level increases suddenly up to the end.  There are also no Special Features whatsoever as I don't consider the Thearetical Trailer as ""special"" and indeed should be expected fare in all dvds anyway.  Fans of this film should wait for a much better restored version to be made first with proper bonus features and at least Dolby Digital Surround Sound options 5.1 with THX DTS as well.

Enough has already been said about the magnificent and absolutely wonderful performances given by any and all of the main characters, and I wholeheartedly agree.  At the same time, I am a  huge fan of the supporting actor, those individuals without whom a picture  just couldn't come across as it was meant to.  In viewing this gem, watch  for what goes on around and &quot;behind&quot; the scenes, so to speak.  The mustached man sitting at the bar at the beginning is a fabulous  example.  As the scene unfolds, watch for this man's reactions to what is  going on around him---absolutely wonderful!  The lady singing at Veta  Louise's teaparty is another; when she gets to the lyrics &quot;Hop, hop,  hop, hop, hippity-hop,&quot; watch for Veta's wide-eyed reaction!  It's  hysterical!  Jesse White's portrayal of Wilson is another one to closely  watch.  His initial and then growing attraction to Myrtle Mae is  masterfully drawn and played out.  His interaction with and reaction to the  other main characters is hilarious.  Watch how the taxi cab driver reacts  to Elwood, especially when he reaches for the wrench in the  glovebox--priceless!  One of my all-time favorite scenes involves two  equally important supporting characters: Mr. Cracker, the Bartender, and  Wilson, the hospital strong-man.  As a fracas breaks out at Charlie's Bar,  Elwood calms everyone down, and then it happens:  Mr. Cracker looks at  Wilson and utters the unforgettable line, &quot;And any more trouble out of  you, Wisenheimer, and I'll butter your necktie!&quot;  They just don't  write 'em like that any more! Watch this glorious film, then watch it again  with an eye out for what's going on around the edges of center stage.  Classics are made up of ingredients such as this film contains, from the  first scene to the very last.  And, as has been said so well by others,  movies CAN be made without the use of foul language, nudity and sex scenes,  blow-em-up and gun-em-down violence, and terrible, horrible messages.  Harvey is a prime example.

Dowd, an amiable alcoholic whose best friend is an invisible giant rabbit, variously reported by Stewart to be either 6 feet 3 inches or 6 feet 8 inches tall.  For those who are unfamiliar with this story and who may be concerned about the alcohol angle, be assured that there is almost no drinking depicted, and no drunkenness.In a story populated by eccentrics, only two people play it straight:  young Dr. Sanderson and Nurse Kelly.  Around them swirls a galaxy of great Hollywood character actors with quirky mannerisms controlled just enough to keep them believable, rendering a textbook lesson in finely tuned comedic technique. Watch the faces of these marvelous actors, listen to their distinctive voices, and learn how a classic comedy is created.Josephine Hull plays Elwood's long-suffering sister.  Her tribulations with her brother and his friend Harvey garnered for her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.  Jessie White, later known as the original Lonely Maytag Repairman, is an orderly at Chumley's Rest, which he describes matter-of-factly as ""our nut house"".  Every character in the story is lovingly portrayed, and none more so than Elwood P. Dowd, which James Stewart said was one of his favorite roles.

You could find it tragic, in a way, but if you just sit back and enjoy it, it's pretty funny. I started laughing in the beginning, when that big lady was singing the goofy song and bouncing like, well, a rabbit. And the movie got funnier from there.When Elwood's (James Stewart) sister went to get him committed and got committed herself, it was hilarious. I mean, in a way it was horrible, because these days when you get taken to the hospital you don't get your clothes torn off and get thrown into a bathtub. (As someone who has studied the mental health system, this is partly why I found the film so interesting.) It was hilarious when the doctor was relieved about his close call of almost committing Elwood instead. That's his psychological expertise! It was also interesting how they panicked about a lawsuit. I wouldn't have thought that would be such an issue in that time period. (Much like today, what the sister went through was a bummer, but she doesn't deserve a fortune for being inconvenienced for an hour. An apology would suffice.)I liked the whole theme of the movie. Elwood obviously had a ""problem."" (Or did he? We wonder at the end.) But he was happy and was not bothering anyone. In fact, he was kind to everyone he met.

Unlike in so many of his other movies, he is not fighting for justice or dealing with some difficult situation. He is just enjoying the ride and doing a fine job. Here's the James Stewart we loved have loved all these years and miss.Stewart is kind-hearted Elwood Dowd--a very pleasant, likeable sort of guy with one HUGE quirk--his best friend and confidant is a 6 foot invisible rabbit named Harvey. Needless to say, Elwood's invisible friend creates endless embarassment for his older sister Veta in her attempts to climb the social ladder and find a husband for her spinster daughter. There is only one solution. Veta will have Elwood committed to a mental insitution but it's Veta who ends up committed.It's Stewart's calm, sweet nature that fills the screen and makes us wonder what is the harm in having an imaginary friend? It's not clear how Harvey entered Stewart's life but they are best friends and devoted to each other...hey, didn't I just say Harvey was imaginary? That's the fun of it.

His overwrought sister Veta can't take it anymore, since he is ruining the chances of her daughter Myrtle Mae finding a suitable husband.  She wants to get him committed to the Chumley Sanitarium.  And that's when things begin to get very complicated for all concerned.  As comedies go, Harvey isn't one of those riotous, laugh out loud howlers.  It does have some laugh out loud moments, mostly supplied by the inimitable Josephine Hull as poor Veta.  She's extremely funny, with her quavering, fluttery voice, and expressive eyes.  The comedy is more gentle and rooted in human nature.  Stewart hits all the right notes as Elwood, a terminally calm and happy man who seems much more at peace with himself and the world than the apparently sane people around him.  He and the film leave you questioning what the harm is in a man who sees a big white rabbit, but loves life and making friends and who really disturbs no one.

Harvey is an invisible large rabbit friend to the very friendly and good mannered Elwood P. Dowd, played by James Stewart.Elwood always looks out for Harvey and makes sure people who come up to talk with him are introduced to his best friend. Elwood also has a bit of a drinking problem but that's not the thing that embarrasses him to his much, much older sister (played by Josephine Hull who won an Oscar for her performance) who while seeing nothing wrong with living off his money and under his roof, sees Elwood as an embarrassment to her social ambitions and plans to marry her daughter off into it. After Elwood embarrasses her in front of a very important party she decides to have Elwood shipped off to a mental asylum but her plan immediately starts to backfire when she is committed instead. As various people talk to Elwood and mental asylum employees try and track him down everyone starts to question if there is in fact anything wrong with Elwood's (and Harvey's) behaviour and maybe if Elwood's outlook on life from his mother to choose pleasant over smart isn't so bad after all and something they could aspire follow a little to as well!",5,Classic 1950 Film That May Have You Revaluating Your Everyday Behaviour,1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,1364,"['Ever', 'seen', '6', 'foot', 'three-and-a-half', 'inch', 'Pooka', 'form', 'rabbit', 'No', 'well', 'could', 'most', 'other', 'characters', 'classic', '1950', 'film', 'man', 'best', 'friend', 'Pooka', 'named', 'Harvey', 'Harvey', 'invisible', 'large', 'rabbit', 'friend', 'very', 'friendly', 'good', 'mannered', 'Elwood', 'P.', 'Dowd', 'played', 'James', 'Stewart.Elwood', 'always', 'out', 'Harvey', 'sure', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'up', 'talk', 'are', 'introduced', 'best', 'friend', 'Elwood', 'also', 'bit', 'drinking', 'problem', 'not', 'thing', 'much', 'much', 'older', 'sister', 'played', 'Josephine', 'Hull', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'who', 'seeing', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'living', 'off', 'money', 'roof', 'Elwood', 'embarrassment', 'social', 'ambitions', 'plans', 'marry', 'daughter', 'Elwood', 'front', 'very', 'important', 'party', 'have', 'Elwood', 'shipped', 'off', 'mental', 'asylum', 'plan', 'immediately', 'backfire', 'when', 'committed', 'instead', 'various', 'people', 'talk', 'Elwood', 'mental', 'asylum', 'employees', 'try', 'track', 'down', 'everyone', 'question', 'fact', 'anything', 'wrong', 'Elwood', 'Harvey', 'behaviour', 'maybe', 'Elwood', 'outlook', 'life', 'mother', 'choose', 'pleasant', 'smart', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'something', 'could', 'aspire', 'follow', 'little', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Dowd, an ever so tipsy gentleman, that introduces his friend, Harvey, to almost everyone he meets.Harvey happens to be a six foot invisible rabbit, a pooka! A pooka, according to Irish folklore, is a mischievous spirit, especially one that takes on the form of an animal. In this instance the pooka is a rabbit, one that only Elwood P. Dowd can see. A pooka can enter through locked doors and windows and is said to be here and there, there and here, everywhere and anywhere.Elwood P. lives with his easily flustered sister, Veta Louise, superbly played by Josphine Hull, and her daughter, Myrtle Mae (Victoria Horne). Myrtle Mae desperately wants to get married and, Uncle Elwood, because of Harvey, stands in the way. Elwood will do anything to keep Veta Louise happy even if it means being sent to a sanitarium. This is where everything literally goes crazy!Poor Veta Louise is mistaken as the one being commited! Enter in the man of Myrtle Mae's dreams in the form of Wilson, a male nurse played by Jesse White, the first Maytag repairman. Myrtle Mae's romance with Wilson gets off to a rocky start when he is the one who must forcefully keep Veta Louise locked in the sanitarium. Every time she sees him she screams and says, ""Stay away from that man, Myrtle Mae, and keep him away from me""!Complicating matters further at the sanitarium, is the relationship, or lack of one, between Dr. Sanderson, (Charles Drake) and Nurse Kelly, (Peggy Dow). They are in charge when the mixup happens and find themselves having to find Elwood P. and bring him back.Dr. Chumley, played by the talented Cecil Kellaway, is the head of the sanitarium. He encounters Elwood P. Dowd and Harvey and soon develops a bond with Harvey. Dr. Chumley wants Harvey to stay with him and Elwood, who wants what's best for Harvey, reluctantly leaves without his best friend.The bewildered, impatient taxi driver, played by talented Wallace Ford, (I know you will recognize him) drives the family back and forth to the sanitarium. He and Veta Louise's friend and, not so secret admirer, Judge Gaffney, played by the scraggly voiced William Lynn, add wonderful color to the story.

Elwood is a drunk who hangs around with a giant white rabbit and makes life miserable for his sister and niece. This is not because he is mean or cruel or even because he is a drunk. It's because people just don't understand about the giant and invisible white rabbit.Most people have the impression that Elwood is crazy or that he is drunk and those are the reasons for the rabbit. Both are accurate and both are wrong. Elwood is a bit off the deep end. In a touching conversation with a shrink halfway through the film, Elwood explains how he came to have an alternate view of reality. He also likes his drink, particularly martinis, but he is not an incapacitated drunk. He is a happy one and quite functional. All of this is beside the point, however. The rabbit is real.

As a matter of  fact that is  not the case. Elwood P. Dowd (Jimmy Stewart) is a carefree philanthropist. His big smile is contagious and his selflessness and generosity are adorable. To him, every day is beautiful and every fellow human is important.  If you are fortunate to meet Elwood,  he'd buy you a drink or two and invite you for dinner at his home. No matter what the circumstances, at least he'll give you one of his cards (so you can always reach him) and a warm  compliment, and a peace of his golden heart.Elwood shares his home with his sister Veta Louise (Josephine Hull), her daughter and Harvey, 6-foot tall rabbit, that only he can see. Harvey is Elwood's best friend and constant companion. Unfortunately, Elwood's obsession with his imaginary friend interferes with Veta's plans to marry off her daughter and she decides to put him in a mental hospital. Then a hilarious mix up occurs and Veta finds herself committed instead.  It is now up to Elwood and Harvey to sort the mess out and Veta needs to make a decision -does she want her brother to change and become ""normal and nasty"" or does she prefer him the way he is, loving, caring and generous. And what about Harvey? Well, he is part of the dilemma.There are twists and turns in this much loved classic. Although a comedy, there is a lot of drama and wisdom in it and an important message delivered with refreshing sense of humour. The performances are brilliant, all of the cast play their hearts out. Josephine Hull is fantastic and she rightly deserves her Oscar for this performance but the show belongs to the ever-captivating Jimmy Stewart, who in my opinion was robbed again on the Academy Awards night. Lets not forget Harvey, he is brilliant too. If you've had trouble seeing him throughout the show, you can't miss him at the end. Trust me, he was there and I saw him, 6'8 foot tall, white rabbit! He will take you to a better world, where all days are beautiful and everybody is important and appreciated.The DVD transfer is good quality with clear sound and picture in 4:3 ratio. There is a theatrical trailer and a special introduction by Jimmy Stewart, which was recorded in 1990. Harvey is a fabulous movie, one that simply  cannot be made nowadays.

This is Jimmy Stewart at his best:  sweet, polite, and happy.  HARVEY is an excellent choice for a lazy Sunday morning with the entire family.Elwood P. Dowd has an imaginary friend, whose name is HARVEY.  HARVEY is an invisible, 6 foot tall, white rabbit, who accompanies Elwood everywhere.  Ever polite, Elwood introduces HARVEY to everyone he meets.  However, since only Elwood can see HARVEY, most folks think that Elwood is crazy.But is Elwood crazy?  That question is left for the audience to ponder.  The fact is that it doesn't really matter if Elwood is crazy.  Elwood is kind, polite, pleasant, and always has a good time right where he is.  It just doesn't matter if he has a giant, talking, white rabbit for a best friend or not.The story of HARVEY is delightful and engaging. Jimmy Stewart is at his very best as Elwood.  The rest of the supporting cast is outstanding, including Josephine Hull who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Elwood's sister.  Of course, HARVEY is excellent as himself.  The black and white cinematography is gorgeous!  The play of light and shadow gives this movie a calm, dreamy quality that could not ever be duplicated in color.On my DVD, Jimmy Stewart gives a marvelous, sentimental introduction to HARVEY.  As part of the introduction, Mr. Stewart said that people still stop him on the streets and ask if HARVEY is there with him.  At first, he thought people were pulling his leg.  But he soon came to realize that folks were serious.  They wanted to meet HARVEY and give him their regards.  It seems that many people a have friend like HARVEY that they talk to about their problems, and they wanted to let HARVEY know that they believe in him.  This charming story brought a tear to my eye.  The world would probably be a much better place if there were more HARVEYs and more Elwood P.

I enjoyed it as a kid and I enjoy it even more as an adult. That's the main reason the title gets the review it does (it's a five star film in my eyes), as the actual disc leaves some things to be desired. First off, the picture is certainly an improvement in some ways. The bright outdoor scenes are so fantastically rendered that they look like they could have been filmed yesterday. But as soon as the picture moves indoors, the amount of grain often became distracting and very digital looking. (And don't get me started on the opening titles.) Is some of this to be expected? Of course. The film was made in 1950, though for the record, I've seen some older films that came out looking better. Boy, would I love to be able to see this transfer next to one that does not use the ""grain averaging"" technique that Universal has employed for comparison. For bonus features, they are largely absent, aside from the trailer, a short interview with Stewart from the video release and a couple of unrelated pieces that tie in with the studio's 100th anniversary. The real way in which the blu fails miserably is that I have never seen such a horribly put together presentation come from a major studio and it very nearly drove me to rate it much, much lower. There is no main menu present at all. Even the Warner Bros titles that launched right into the feature had a menu screen that one could go to. With Harvey, you can only access pop-up menus while the film is playing. And if you have to stop the film for any reason, you have to start the entire process of going through their annoying trailers/warnings/advertisements/instructions again. At least that's been the case on my PS3. I've only had one other disc pull that stunt as I can recall (Sony's Men in Black) and it's so non-consumer friendly that it's maddening. It's so shoddy that I have to wonder if Universal's quality people were on vacation to let it slip through.

Harvey also provides much food for thought on the topic of insanity.The story is about young, earnest Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart) and his ""friend,"" a six-foot tall, invisible white rabbit named Harvey.  Much to the consternation of his sisters, everyone avoids the family because of Dowd's oddball character.  True, Dowd spends much time at the bar, and there is a hint of tragedy in his past.  But is that the reason for Harvey's . . . existence?When Dowd's younger sister Myrtle Mae's society debut party is interrupted by Elwood introducing Harvey to the wealthy matrons in the parlor, that is the last straw for Elwood's older sister Vera.  She decides to have Elwood committed to a mental institution, and promptly pays a visit to Chumley's Rest Home, where she pours out her story to the young attending physician.  Much hilarity and misunderstanding ensues.The black and white filmography only adds to the charm of this unique story.  The supporting cast is tremendous.  The lady who plays Vera reprises the role she played in the stage production of Harvey.  Harvey is my number one favorite movie of all time.James Stewart comments in the extras that people would come up to him all the time and inquire as to how Harvey was.

As Harvey is very strict and choosy in his social interactions, Mr Dowd is the only one who can actually see Harvey... In fact Harvey is so discreet, that most people tend to disbelief that Harvey exists at all - and some even go as far as calling Mr Dowd just a tinsy weensy crazy...)))This film shows all the adventures of this improbable duo of best friends forever when the day comes for Mr Dowd's family to try to commit him in a psychiatric facility - which, thanks to the incredible charisma and gentle behaviour of Mr Dowd and the clever tricks played by the sneaky Harvey (assuming that he exists of course), will prove to be quite more difficult than anybody could possibly imagine...This film is a most wonderful thing, full of humour, filled with incredibly smart one liners and very intelligent dialog and all of its atmosphere is gentle, heart-warming and soothing.

But unlike other screwball farces, HARVEY has as much heart and thoughtfulness as hilarity. If ARSENIC AND OLD LACE sends you into hysterics every time you see it, HARVEY will unfailingly induce a warm smile. Jimmy Stewart seemed at first an odd choice for the role of an amiable drunk (the role was turned down by Jack Benny and Bing Crosby before Stewart got it); but he plays the part superbly, winning our hearts as well as giving a subtle, naturalistic performance.

We must realize this film was released in 1950 and will not look as good as today's big digitally filmed movies. Home video has given us many formats to view this film. And that's what this blu ray looks like: film. Grain and all. I love that Universal avoids Digital Noise Reduction (or very little use) to remove film grain and detail from their classics for blu ray. These movies should look like film and NOT video. With the little grain in tact and the awesome detail in this 1080p picture. Don't believe it when reviewers say this looks like DVD upconverted. This blu ray blows away the DVD and any other medium this film has seen over the years. I am glad that Universal released this on blu ray and not just DVD. This classic compliments Universal's 100th Anniversary. Would love to see them release more older classics like this and restoring them to the brilliance as HARVEY. This is one detailed picture!

Dowd (James Stewart) whose best friend just happens to be a six foot, 3 inch white rabbit named Harvey. Naturally, Elwood?s family thinks he's a few carrots shy of a salad. After thoroughly, but unintentionally humiliating his two spinster aunts, Veta (Josephine Hull) and Myrtle (Victoria Horne) at a social gathering, the two plot to secretly have Elwood committed to a sanitarium for psychiatric evaluation. However, upon visiting the sanitarium with Veta, Elwood meets Dr. Sanderson (Charles Drake) and the administering nurse, Miss Kelly (Peggy Dow) who mistake Veta for their patient and promptly usher her off to a padded cell, leaving Elwood free to roam the grounds, then plot as to how he can create the ideal environment for Miss Kelly and Dr. Sanderson to fall in love. Eventually the oversight is corrected and Elwood is ushered into the sanitarium for treatment. However, a reprieve comes when Dr. Chumley (Cecil Kellaway) realizes that Elwood is not crazy.  You see, Harvey really does exist. He?s an invisible spirit guide of sorts, presiding over those who need his services the most.  This film is a delightful blend of comedy and drama and blessed with an inexplicable magic that makes the entire premise seem entirely plausible.The transfer is stunning!

As James Stewart points out in the introduction to this classic film, he was also one of his.You see, Elwood was a man of the world, with brains, personality, and friends- then he met Harvey. Of course, Harvey didn't really change any of this; Harvey just appeared at the moment Elwood really needed him. You see, Elwood had wrestled with ""reality"" for 35 years, and he was glad to say that he finally won out over it. Perhaps Harvey was his reward for winning out on it. Elwood had been ""oh, so smart"", and then he had been ""oh, so pleasant""- and he came to find that he greatly recommended pleasant over smart. Perhaps this was why Harvey chose to watch out over him. In any case, Elwood spent the rest of his life visiting bars and taverns, taking the time to listen to all classes of people, inviting them home, taking their minds off of their troubles, introducing them to Harvey....

And, like most of the characters decide, sometimes choosing to be pleasant is better than choosing to be regular, or choosing to be smart.  Lucky for this movie, it's both pleasant and smart.Now, if you haven't seen this movie yourself, you've probably seen clips of it on other movies, such as ""Field of Dreams.""  But really, seeing this movie would be something you should get around to doing.  James Stewart plays the warm small-town friendly neighbor with aplomb, even when in socially awkward situations involving disbelief of his pooka.  Everyone else plays the anxious ones... people running around getting into fits because of things they only half understand.  But as the story goes on, Stewart's Elwood P. Dowd becomes the calm center of gravity that everyone eventually leans on to take a breath of air and let their imagination go.What we get is a re-affirmation of imagination and faith, much like the feeling to be gotten from ""Miracle on 34th Street.""  However, ""Harvey"" can be watched year round!  And best of all, it shows how to be a good person beyond simply catering to beliefs, but truly following a smile and an ear for listening.  ""Seems like it'd be a little dull, you should let her do the talking"", Dowd tells the psychologist (!) who confesses his escapist dream to sit under a tree, drink beer, and talk to a woman for two weeks.  Dowd is both wise and happy, and the movie makes no point of trying to give him difficulties... it's everyone else's problem if they don't want to believe in 6'3 1/2"" rabbits...--PolarisDiB",4,"""You can be all smart or all pleasant.

Therefore, think twice about dismissing the next person you see talking to no one in particular.Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart) is a simple man who is befriends everyone he meets.  However, he does have one eccentric characteristic about him - his constant companion is an invisible rabbit who is over six feet tall named Harvey.

Concerned about his mental health, Elwood's sister, Veta Louise Simmons (Josephine Hull) decides to have her brother committed to a sanatorium.  The plan goes awry when the sanatorium staff mistakenly commits the wrong person and releases Elwood.  A chase ensues when the situation is sorted out even though Elwood hasn't the slightest clue about what all the fuss around him is about.""Harvey"" is a cute film on one level and an insightful commentary on perception and sanity on another.  Yet, it is a one-joke film that gets more and more tired as it goes along.  Stewart brings much conviction to his role but his trademark charm is not enough to save the production.  The screwball-comedy-inspired sequences at the sanatorium are amusing but are nothing people familiar with the genre have not seen before.

Dowd a nice looking, well off, friendly and polite man in his forties with a tendency to drink too much and one little oddity.  Almost everywhere Elwood goes his dear friend,Harvey, a six foot three and a half inch invisible (to most people) rabbit goes with him.  Elwood's snobbish older sister decides he and Harvey are ruining her and her husband hunting daughter's social life and tries to have him committed to a sanitarium and misunderstandings and hilarity ensue. James Stewart is very good as mild mannered Elwood and Josephine Hull is excellent playing his older sister the part she created on the Broadway stage.  Jesse White who is immediately recognizable both from his long role as the lonely Maytag repairman and from many character parts on sitcoms is a scene stealer as a sanitarium employee and the whole film is excellently cast.  The set and costumes are authentic looking and the ""fashionable"" older ladies' fussy hats, furs and hairstyles remind me of the way elderly women were still dressing for special occasions when I was a child growing up in the 60's and 70's.  In the film Elwood states his mother always said you have to be either smart or pleasant and he recommends pleasant.  I recommend this pleasant movie that is also quite smart.",5,"Hilarious, Charming Classic  Film",1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,1345,"['HARVEY', 'well', 'acted', 'very', 'funny', 'classic', 'film', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Elwood', 'P.', 'Dowd', 'nice', 'looking', 'well', 'friendly', 'polite', 'man', 'forties', 'tendency', 'drink', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'little', 'oddity', 'Almost', 'everywhere', 'Elwood', 'dear', 'friend', 'Harvey', 'six', 'foot', 'three', 'half', 'inch', 'invisible', 'most', 'people', 'rabbit', 'Elwood', 'snobbish', 'older', 'sister', 'Harvey', 'are', 'ruining', 'husband', 'hunting', 'daughter', 'social', 'life', 'tries', 'have', 'committed', 'sanitarium', 'misunderstandings', 'hilarity', 'ensue', 'James', 'Stewart', 'very', 'good', 'mild', 'mannered', 'Elwood', 'Josephine', 'Hull', 'excellent', 'playing', 'older', 'sister', 'part', 'created', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'Jesse', 'White', 'who', 'immediately', 'recognizable', 'long', 'role', 'lonely', 'Maytag', 'repairman', 'many', 'character', 'parts', 'sitcoms', 'scene', 'stealer', 'sanitarium', 'employee', 'whole', 'film', 'excellently', 'cast', 'set', 'costumes', 'are', 'authentic', 'looking', 'fashionable', 'older', 'ladies', 'fussy', 'hats', 'furs', 'hairstyles', 'remind', 'way', 'elderly', 'women', 'were', 'still', 'dressing', 'special', 'occasions', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'growing', 'up', '60', '70', 'film', 'Elwood', 'mother', 'always', 'said', 'have', 'be', 'either', 'smart', 'pleasant', 'pleasant', 'recommend', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'also', 'quite', 'smart']",N/A
