This movie is more suited to those who love Jane Austen's Fanny Price just the way she is, which, is a very morally upright person, who will not be persuaded against her better judgement. This story proves that simply because a person comes from a wealthy background, they dress right, they speak correctly, and they look good, this does not make them a virtuous and upright individual. Some people will not like this movie based on the fact that it does not appeal visually.  Please look beyond the fact that the actors are not glamorous.  This is a great movie and should be placed in it's rightful place next to Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion.

228884,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,6300249824,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[6, 6]","My favorites of the Austen stories are actually ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"" either of which I will watch in film, because there is precious little they can do other than totally butcher the stories, that makes them anything but delightful to watch.  My enjoyment of a cinematic Mansfield Park, however, is greatly dependant on its rendition, and this one is my favorite, largely because it is the most sympathetic of them.I've seen at least one version that suggests that Sir Thomas Bertram was virtually a pedophile; that really didn't go over.  It's not that it couldn't have been so--given human nature, I would be more surprised if it hadn't happened on occasion--but it's just not my Jane Austen!  More like Dickens.  In this version, Sir Thomas is a well meaning if somewhat socially bigoted person.  In his world, money equates to quality, and little Fanny Price has little to recommend her.  That he gradually grows to appreciate her good sense and to actually treat her with the affection of a real parent makes him a wonderful character, because he above all of the others actually grows by his experiences.  In fact more than any of them, he is actually aware of the experiences in the first place!The most stellar of the characters, however, is that of Lady Bertram, played brilliantly by Angela Pleasance the daughter of the character actor Donald Pleasance.  Her languid indifference to her life captures more fully than anything else the total emptiness of her position at the top of the social ladder.  Her children are raised by others; her household is managed by others; her every decision is made for her by others.  One senses a beautiful, if perhaps mentally vacant, daughter of a modestly well off social climbing family who managed to carry off the most eligible bachelor of her generation as her prize for simply having existed; that says a lot about the society of the time and about its attitude towards the value of women.  Having had the heir and a spare as required, she retired to a sort of mental oblivion.  It is only when engaged by Fanny that she actually energizes and takes part in what goes on in her world.  Fanny bestows her full attention on Lady Bertram as though she were present and not transparent, unlike the attitude of the rest of the family.Here, too, the daughters Maria and Julia are much more sympathetic.  Maria decides to marry for money, but her alternative of marrying for love was so obviously a poor one given her selection, that one can't help but feel that her actual choice was the best one. She doesn't seem to have been an unpleasant person, simply an ill-fated one.  The outcome of Julia's marriage to Mr. Yeates was so little touched upon, that one can only hope for her happiness.  Who knows; perhaps even Maria will be happier sidelined by divorce.Aunt Norris is the official ""bad guy"" of the family.  She is so obsequious to her brother-in-low, Sir Thomas, and so disparing of the young Fanny that she is obnoxious in the extreme.  The former is understandable, since she is to some extent dependant on Sir Thomas's good will; however the latter is due to her need to feel ""better than"" her neice Fanny.  She lacks anything of the real humility of her neice, and assumes all of the responsiblity for what she perceives as putting the man in her ""debt""--ie. the advantageous marriage of his daughter Maria--and eschews any responsibility for her wrong decisions--ie. her support of the theatrical activities of the younger Bertrams.  To be honest, she is a survivor in a world that leaves little margin for error in social sensitivity, and to err is to be plunged into disaster.  Still, when she is packed off to live with Maria, one can't help but feel she got her just cumupance.The Crawford brother and sister pair are perhaps the least likeable, but then they're not supposed to be.  They are the personification of all that's objectionable about high society--or at least different from the rest of it.  They are foils for the practical good sense of Fanny, and that which throws the country cousins off the ""right path.""  They are the ""beautiful people"" of their time; spoiled, bored, ignorant of or indifferent to the realities of others' lives.A fine presentation of the story and my favorite.",4,My favorite Mansfield Park version,1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,4290,"['favorites', 'Austen', 'stories', 'are', 'actually', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'either', 'will', 'watch', 'film', 'precious', 'little', 'can', 'do', 'other', 'totally', 'butcher', 'stories', 'anything', 'delightful', 'watch', 'enjoyment', 'cinematic', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'however', 'greatly', 'dependant', 'rendition', 'one', 'favorite', 'largely', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'them.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'one', 'version', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Bertram', 'was', 'virtually', 'pedophile', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'over', 'not', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'given', 'human', 'nature', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'surprised', 'had', ""n't"", 'happened', 'occasion', 'just', 'not', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'More', 'Dickens', 'version', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'well', 'meaning', 'somewhat', 'socially', 'bigoted', 'person', 'world', 'money', 'equates', 'quality', 'little', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'little', 'recommend', 'gradually', 'appreciate', 'good', 'sense', 'actually', 'treat', 'affection', 'real', 'parent', 'wonderful', 'character', 'others', 'actually', 'grows', 'experiences', 'fact', 'more', 'actually', 'aware', 'experiences', 'first', 'place', 'most', 'stellar', 'characters', 'however', 'Lady', 'Bertram', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Angela', 'Pleasance', 'daughter', 'character', 'actor', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'languid', 'indifference', 'life', 'more', 'fully', 'anything', 'else', 'total', 'emptiness', 'position', 'top', 'social', 'ladder', 'children', 'are', 'raised', 'others', 'household', 'managed', 'others', 'decision', 'made', 'others', 'One', 'beautiful', 'perhaps', 'mentally', 'vacant', 'daughter', 'modestly', 'well', 'social', 'climbing', 'family', 'who', 'managed', 'carry', 'off', 'most', 'eligible', 'bachelor', 'generation', 'prize', 'simply', 'having', 'existed', 'lot', 'society', 'time', 'attitude', 'value', 'women', 'Having', 'had', 'heir', 'spare', 'required', 'retired', 'sort', 'mental', 'oblivion', 'only', 'when', 'engaged', 'Fanny', 'actually', 'part', 'what', 'world', 'Fanny', 'full', 'attention', 'Lady', 'Bertram', 'were', 'present', 'not', 'transparent', 'attitude', 'rest', 'family.Here', 'too', 'daughters', 'Maria', 'Julia', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Maria', 'marry', 'money', 'alternative', 'marrying', 'love', 'was', 'so', 'obviously', 'poor', 'one', 'given', 'selection', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'actual', 'choice', 'was', 'best', 'one', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'unpleasant', 'person', 'simply', 'ill-fated', 'one', 'outcome', 'Julia', 'marriage', 'Mr.', 'Yeates', 'was', 'so', 'little', 'touched', 'upon', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'happiness', 'Who', 'perhaps', 'even', 'Maria', 'will', 'be', 'happier', 'sidelined', 'divorce.Aunt', 'Norris', 'official', 'bad', 'guy', 'family', 'so', 'obsequious', 'brother-in-low', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'so', 'disparing', 'young', 'Fanny', 'obnoxious', 'extreme', 'former', 'understandable', 'extent', 'dependant', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'good', 'will', 'however', 'latter', 'due', 'need', 'feel', 'better', 'neice', 'Fanny', 'anything', 'real', 'humility', 'neice', 'responsiblity', 'what', 'putting', 'man', 'debt', 'ie', 'advantageous', 'marriage', 'daughter', 'Maria', 'eschews', 'responsibility', 'wrong', 'decisions', 'ie', 'support', 'theatrical', 'activities', 'younger', 'Bertrams', 'be', 'honest', 'survivor', 'world', 'little', 'margin', 'error', 'social', 'sensitivity', 'err', 'be', 'plunged', 'disaster', 'Still', 'when', 'packed', 'live', 'Maria', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'got', 'just', 'cumupance.The', 'Crawford', 'brother', 'sister', 'pair', 'are', 'perhaps', 'least', 'likeable', 'then', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'are', 'personification', 'objectionable', 'about', 'high', 'society', 'least', 'different', 'rest', 'are', 'foils', 'practical', 'good', 'sense', 'Fanny', 'country', 'right', 'path', 'are', 'beautiful', 'people', 'time', 'spoiled', 'bored', 'ignorant', 'indifferent', 'realities', 'others', 'lives.A', 'fine', 'presentation', 'story', 'favorite']",Mansfield Park VHS

Fanny Price (Sylvestra Le Touzel) is sent to live with her rich relations the Bertrams' at Mansfield Park.  Unappreciated and made to feel inferior by all except her kind cousin Edmund (Nicholas Farrell), Fanny's lot is that of a glorified servant-girl. Faced with a marriage proposal from the most unwanted of admirers, her plight seems quite hopeless, until the day when Edmund reveals his love for her.  A strong cast including Anna Massey, Angela Pleasence, Bernard Hepton and Samantha Bond, make this MANSFIELD PARK an utter joy from beginning to end.Sylvestra Le Touzel, with her elegant and understated beauty, looks as though she has stepped out of a painting of the era; and is in my opinion the very embodiment of Fanny.  Likewise Nicholas Farrell gives Edmund the humanity and heart that sets him apart from his cold relatives.  The adaptation by Ken Taylor (six 50-minute episodes) allows the full arc of Austen's story to play out with ease.

However, its main strength is also its main handicap, resulting in a production that adheres so strictly to the book that it feels drawn-out and slow at points.  The exception to this is the end scene, which wraps up the story too quickly.Like the other ""early"" BBC Austen productions, there are occasional swerves into silliness that aren't intentional and can be distracting.  Sylvestra Le Touzel, as Fanny, emphasizes her speeches with odd hand gestures.  Mr. Crawford looks like a bipedal mouse in pants, and his sister, Mary, who is supposed to be so lovely, looks about the same except in a bad `80's wig and a dress.  I giggle just thinking about Mr. Yeats's wig.Still, there are some good points.  On the balance I liked Le Touzel as Fanny, and Alison Fiske did very well as Mrs. Price.  Angela Pleasence's Aunt Bertram reminded me an awful lot of Jessica Tate from SOAP, but I still liked her very much.  The costumes and sets are fine but not remarkable, and the sound for the outdoor scenes is mediocre to poor.On the whole, I'd say that this is a solid, but not great production.

Thurlow,"[2, 2]","""Mansfield Park"" may be Jane Austen's one-off novel, in which she plays with the conventions of period romance by making her heroine rather passive and quiet, while the nominal villains of the piece are charming and attractive.  Translating the long and subtle ""Mansfield Park"" to film has proved to be a challenge; this 1983 BBC version might be the best of several attempts.As the story opens in the England of the Napoleonic wars, the young Fanny Price, a member of a large and improverished family in Portsmouth, is sent to live with her wealthy Aunt and Uncle Bertram at their country estate of Mansfield Park.  Fanny is small, sickly, and poorly educated; she is ignored by her cousins except for the kindly Edmund,and tormented by her Aunt Norris.The story jumps ahead a few years.  Fanny's Uncle Bertram departs Mansfield Park for the West Indies on business, leaving his teenage children and niece with insufficient adult supervision.  The arrival in the household of a Mr. Yates, a fan of the theater, and of the charming and worldly siblings Mary and Henry Crawford, is an invitation to romantic intrigue and forbidden behavior.  Fanny will be repeatedly challenged to live up to her high moral standards in the face of seemingly reasonable temptations; at stake is her future happiness with the man for whom she really cares.At over 300 minutes, this BBC version captures the best parts of the novel with excellent television production values.

Although beautifully cast (with one exception) and acted, the production fails to catch fire--perhaps because too few ""liberties"" were taken in terms of drawing in the viewer.  Another problem, at least for me, is the casting of Robert Burbage as Henry Crawford, who, although believable as Mary's brother in terms of his physical appearance, does not seem the man to have captivated so many London ladies or the Misses Bertram.  He does not convince in the scenes set in Portsmouth where he tries to demonstrate to  heroine Fanny Price his conversion for the sake of her love. For the film (and the novel) to succeed, we need to believe that Henry was capable of tempting Fanny, and here we never believe Burbage/Crawford for a moment.In short, though a worthy attempt, not the ideal film of ""Mansfield Park.""PS Nicholas Farrell (Edmund) and Sylvestra Le Touzel were teamed as husband and wife again in the 2006 film ""Amazing Grace.""",3,Too faithful?,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,1074,"['version', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'think', 'correctly', 'uncommon', 'complaint', 'too', 'faithful', 'original', 'novel', 'beautifully', 'cast', 'one', 'exception', 'acted', 'production', 'catch', 'fire', 'perhaps', 'too', 'few', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'terms', 'drawing', 'viewer', 'problem', 'least', 'casting', 'Robert', 'Burbage', 'Henry', 'Crawford', 'who', 'believable', 'Mary', 'brother', 'terms', 'physical', 'appearance', 'not', 'seem', 'man', 'have', 'captivated', 'so', 'many', 'London', 'ladies', 'Misses', 'Bertram', 'not', 'convince', 'scenes', 'set', 'Portsmouth', 'where', 'demonstrate', 'heroine', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'conversion', 'sake', 'love', 'film', 'novel', 'succeed', 'need', 'believe', 'Henry', 'was', 'capable', 'tempting', 'Fanny', 'here', 'never', 'believe', 'Burbage/Crawford', 'moment.In', 'short', 'worthy', 'attempt', 'not', 'ideal', 'film', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'PS', 'Nicholas', 'Farrell', 'Edmund', 'Sylvestra', 'Le', 'Touzel', 'were', 'teamed', 'husband', 'wife', 'again', '2006', 'film', 'Amazing', 'Grace']",Mansfield Park VHS

Much of the dialogue is taken straight out of MP, and very few liberties are taken with incident or language.- Where dialoge HAS been added, it is well-written and consistent with what Miss Austen wrote, and with the characters of the story.- It unfurls itself at a slow pace, almost as if you were reading the novel. For some this might be tedious--but if you don't like this production, you probably won't like the MP the Novel, either.- Sylvestra Le Touzel does a nice job of bringing Fanny Price to life. I felt that the little eccentricities that she added (the ""chopping"" that one reviewer referred to, starts & shrieks, and even that hysterical bout of crying in the East Room) were a believable part of those ""awkwardnesses that were...as good as graces"" that Austen describes in her. They show a repressed 18 year old girl in an uncomfortable social situation, muddling through. I thought she made Fanny likeable and believeable.- Robin Langford IS Mr. Yates! It's worth the price of the DVD just to hear him say ""theatre"".Best characterizations are Edmund, Sir Thomas, Tom Bertram,  and Mrs. Norris. While the latter is certainly more strident in the novel, it's easier to understand Sir Thomas' keeping her around when her poisoned barbs are delivered with a veneer of pleasantness.Less ideal is Lady Bertram. While anyone who has read the novel might interpret her strange, slow speech as Langour, to someone who hasn't she might well come across as mentally ill. However, she is funny, if you can get past the mannerisms.I was disappointed with the Crawfords, though. The actress who played Mary Crawford is very good, but doesn't look the part. And that dark wig is very distracting. I would rather see her natural color. The black hair is too obviously wrong for her complexion.The actor playing Henry Crawford looks far too young for the part, and doesn't have the mature confidence and subtlety that Henry Crawford exudes in the book. He looks like he's trying too hard to be seductive, and about as much of a threat to Maria Bertram as a high school boy coming on to his teacher. Conversely, the actor who plays William Price looks too old for the part, trying to act young. In those scenes where he's hugging Fanny, I kept thinking, ""Get your hands off her!"" I wonder if the drama would have been better if they had switched the two--had Robert Burbage play William Price and Allan Hendrick play Henry Crawford.NEVERTHELESS, I think anyone who appreciates Jane Austen ought to at least see this lovingly done version of Mansfield Park.

I think that some of the 1980s BBC productions (including ""Pride and Prejudice"") number among its best, and this production certainly serves as an example. Despite the (understandably, given its age) shop-worn appearance of the print, the costumes and settings glitter with elegance.The actors are as good as is to be expected in a BBC series. The only character I thought was unreal was Angela Pleasance, whose Lady Bertram was so 'out of it' that she suggested that Her Ladyship's problem was an addiction to laudanum. However, I liked Anna Massey's caustic interpretation of Aunt Norris, a thoroughly unlikable character, whose constant belittling of poor relation Fanny Price has caused that young woman to become self-effacing with feelings of unworthiness among the splendid surroundings of her 'betters'. Ms Le Touzel portrays Fanny with such repression that at times one would like to shake her. In contrast to Fanny's diffidence, Mary Crawford, the vicar's sister-in-law, sparkles with wit, and emerges as a 'modern' character, who might be a heroine in the twenty-first century, but, since she has a mind of her own, is thoroughly out of place in the early nineteenth!Fanny's character becomes understandable and sympathetic when, after seven years, she goes home to her family in Portsmouth, and she realises the contrast between life in cramped quarters with her over-worked, disorganised mother and her drunken father, and life in solitary elegance at Mansfield Park. Her endurance of her rather second-best existence at Mansfield allows her to endure her six weeks at Portsmouth where she is equally unappreciated. We are happy when rescue comes in the form of a recall to the Park, and she takes her sister with her to partake in what will be a satisfying Jane Austen future.You know you're watching a good series based on a Jane Austin novel when, even though absolutely nothing of importance happens for 266 minutes, you love every one of them and don't want it to end.I watched all six episodes of this series at one sitting.",5,An Enjoyable Day at the Park,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,2147,"['checked', '1986', 'BBC', 'six-part', 'series', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'library', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'think', '1980s', 'BBC', 'productions', 'including', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'number', 'best', 'production', 'certainly', 'example', 'understandably', 'given', 'age', 'shop-worn', 'appearance', 'print', 'costumes', 'settings', 'glitter', 'elegance.The', 'actors', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'be', 'expected', 'BBC', 'series', 'only', 'character', 'thought', 'was', 'unreal', 'was', 'Angela', 'Pleasance', 'Lady', 'Bertram', 'was', 'so', 'suggested', 'Her', 'Ladyship', 'problem', 'was', 'addiction', 'laudanum', 'However', 'liked', 'Anna', 'Massey', 'caustic', 'interpretation', 'Aunt', 'Norris', 'thoroughly', 'unlikable', 'character', 'constant', 'belittling', 'poor', 'relation', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'caused', 'young', 'woman', 'become', 'self-effacing', 'feelings', 'unworthiness', 'splendid', 'surroundings', ""'betters"", 'Ms', 'Le', 'Touzel', 'Fanny', 'such', 'repression', 'times', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'shake', 'contrast', 'Fanny', 'diffidence', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'vicar', 'sister-in-law', 'sparkles', 'wit', ""'modern"", 'character', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'heroine', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'mind', 'own', 'thoroughly', 'place', 'early', 'nineteenth', 'Fanny', 'character', 'understandable', 'sympathetic', 'when', 'seven', 'years', 'home', 'family', 'Portsmouth', 'contrast', 'life', 'cramped', 'quarters', 'over-worked', 'disorganised', 'mother', 'drunken', 'father', 'life', 'solitary', 'elegance', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'endurance', 'rather', 'second-best', 'existence', 'Mansfield', 'endure', 'six', 'weeks', 'Portsmouth', 'where', 'equally', 'unappreciated', 'are', 'happy', 'when', 'rescue', 'form', 'recall', 'Park', 'sister', 'partake', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'satisfying', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'future.You', 'know', ""'re"", 'watching', 'good', 'series', 'based', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'novel', 'when', 'even', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'importance', 'happens', '266', 'minutes', 'love', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'end.I', 'watched', 'six', 'episodes', 'series', 'one', 'sitting']",Mansfield Park VHS

The  only memorable performance is by Jackie Smith-Wood as Mary Crawford, who  brings out all her superficial charm, her shallowness, and, finally, her  amorality. In this movie, she comes off as a much more sympathetic  character than Fanny. Henry Crawford seems like a dressed-up fashion plate  reciting his lines. The movie stayed fairly close to the book, but the  ending in the movie seems more of an afterthought, tacked on in a few lines  of narration.The definitive movie version of Mansfield Park is yet to  be written. The movie currently showing bills itself as a 'wicked comedy',  and Jane Austen never intended Mansfield Park to be read as a comedy. And  while Frances O'Connor is a delight in the current movie and a much better  actress than LeTouzel, her Fanny Price isn't Austen's; O'Connor's Fanny is  strong, spirited, animated, nothing like the weak, spineless Fanny of the  book.

Pleasance portrays Mrs.Bertram with an absolute breathy airheadedness that I personally found to be annoying from the moment we meet her and her dog Pug.No small wonder the woman drinks in the 1998 adaptation and is a wiley feminist in the 2008 version.There is no agreement on how this character should be brought to the screen.Stephana Le Touzel is not a pleasant looking Fanny Price; she is rather plain and grimmacy and has odd affected hand gestures which doesn't hurt the performance, but really doesn't help it either!The production value is low-budget,yet correctly ""staged"" for the time period.All of the wigs are atrocious, and the make up is  out of HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH!!!!Most of the story occurs indoors with only a few outside shots which makes for a claustrophobic experience.Also,because this tries to stay very faithful to the book, it's 4 hour length can be daunting and tedious.It is best watched broken with a rest between Parts One and Two.Well worth the time spent to own this DVD as the other adaptations will undoubtedly be aided in the filling in the blanks as they are shorter in length.For faithfulness and NOT necessarily enjoyment's sake, this 1983 version is your choice.",4,"1983 BBC is closest to the novel,but not necessarily the most enjoyable",1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,3078,"['Face', 'one', 'be', 'content', 'ANY', 'adaptations', 'thus', 'far', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK.It', 'accepted', 'not', 'best', 'novel', 'small', 'wonder', 'screenwriters', 'keep', 'trying', 'rework', 'order', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', '1983', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'unquestionably', 'truest', 'Austen', 'book.Fanny', 'Price', 'sent', 'live', 'wealthy', 'cousins', 'Bertrams', 'expense', 'obnoxious', 'Aunt', 'Norris.There', 'Fanny', 'accepted', 'least', 'servant', 'class', 'relative.She', 'pleasures', 'privileges', 'being', 'wealthy', 'class', 'not', 'rise', 'station', 'life.She', 'always', 'had', 'endearing', 'relationship', 'cousin', 'Edmund', 'eventually', 'love', 'wins', 'out', 'Fanny', 'Edmund', 'will', 'marry.This', 'not', 'spoiler.It', 'simply', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Now', 'who', 'crave', 'accuracy', 'source', 'material', 'simply', 'best', 'most', 'faithful', 'retelling', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK.Most', 'Austen', 'fans', 'will', 'least', 'be', 'pleased', 'novel', 'adhered', '1983', 'time', 'frame', 'fact', 'early', 'BBC', 'production', 'production', 'design', 'quality', 'stagey', 'low', 'budget.Acting', 'uniformly', 'good', 'especially', 'great', 'Anna', 'Massey', 'ofHotel', 'du', 'Lac', '[', 'Region', '2', ']', 'who', 'complete', 'abandon', 'pernicious', 'Aunt', 'Norris.Her', 'performance', 'fullest', 'most', 'robust', 'adaptation', 'HER', 'character', 'full', 'weight', 'novel', 'importance', '.Nicholas', 'Farrell', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'removed', 'triumphant', 'performance', 'inChariots', 'Fire', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'exquisite', 'Edmund', 'again', 'given', 'full', 'latitude', 'flesh', 'out', 'character.On', 'other', 'hand', 'interpretation', 'Mrs.Bertram', 'Angela', 'Pleasance', 'UNIQUE', 'say', 'least.NOTE', 'three', 'adaptations', 'interpret', 'Mrs.Bertram', 'differently', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'fully', 'satisfied', 'Pleasance', 'Mrs.Bertram', 'absolute', 'breathy', 'personally', 'found', 'be', 'annoying', 'moment', 'meet', 'dog', 'Pug.No', 'small', 'wonder', 'woman', '1998', 'adaptation', 'wiley', 'feminist', '2008', 'agreement', 'how', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'brought', 'screen.Stephana', 'Le', 'Touzel', 'not', 'pleasant', 'looking', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'rather', 'plain', 'grimmacy', 'odd', 'affected', 'hand', 'gestures', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'performance', 'really', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'production', 'value', 'low-budget', 'yet', 'correctly', 'staged', 'time', 'period.All', 'wigs', 'are', 'atrocious', 'make', 'up', 'HEDWIG', 'THE', 'ANGRY', 'INCH', 'Most', 'story', 'indoors', 'only', 'few', 'outside', 'shots', 'claustrophobic', 'experience.Also', 'stay', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', '4', 'hour', 'length', 'can', 'be', 'daunting', 'tedious.It', 'best', 'watched', 'broken', 'rest', 'Parts', 'One', 'Two.Well', 'time', 'spent', 'own', 'DVD', 'other', 'adaptations', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'aided', 'filling', 'blanks', 'are', 'shorter', 'length.For', 'faithfulness', 'NOT', 'necessarily', 'enjoyment', 'sake', '1983', 'version', 'choice']",Mansfield Park VHS

Mariah likes Fanny as a friend, but has fallen in love with Edmund, but when she finds out that Edmund wants to be a minister instead of a wealthy mans she breaks his heart and says she will see him no more.  Charles is a crafty man whose only amusement comes from making women fall in love with him and toying with their emotions.  Until he tries to do it to Fanny who will have none of it.  Since she is the only women who has not succome to his ways he falls madly in love with her.  But when she refuses his attentions for a very long time he runs off with her married cousin.  Then with nowhere to turn Edmund decides he wants to marry her so Fanny accepts and they live together happily at Mansfield Park.

Fanny Price must be a sore trial for an actress, for most scenes she must sit silent or speak just a few words.  Her body language is likewise restrained.  In this version we have a lovable Fanny who signals expressively with her eyes, indicating a depth of emotion and anguish that captures the heart.  She is supported by an able ensemble cast who are all flawless in their roles from the amiable Edmund Bertram to the evil Henry Crawford.In Mansfield Park, Jane Austen turns her caustic eye on the situation of the ""poor relation"".  Fanny Price is the daughter of a gently born lady who married a naval officer, now sunk by alcoholism and injury to a life on shore in Portsmouth.  Fanny's mother has two sisters: Mrs. Norris who married a clergyman and Lady Bertram, wife to Sir Thomas.  These two wind up off-handedly bringing Fanny to Mansfield Park as a child where the main object is to impress upon her how inferior her status is to her cousins and how grateful she should be.  Because of this dark undertone, there is less humor in the situation, but by the same token, Fanny's eventual triumph is much larger.If you want stars and glamor, go elsewhere, but for the money this is the best and most faithful rendering of Jane Austen's observant novel.",5,A Faithful and Fabulous Fanny at a fair Price!,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,1422,"['BBC', 'adaption', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'faithfully', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'story', 'quiet', 'heroine', 'who', 'odds', 'marry', 'man', 'who', 'captured', 'heart', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'must', 'be', 'sore', 'trial', 'actress', 'most', 'scenes', 'must', 'sit', 'silent', 'speak', 'just', 'few', 'words', 'body', 'language', 'likewise', 'restrained', 'version', 'have', 'lovable', 'Fanny', 'who', 'expressively', 'eyes', 'indicating', 'depth', 'emotion', 'anguish', 'heart', 'supported', 'able', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'who', 'are', 'flawless', 'roles', 'amiable', 'Edmund', 'Bertram', 'evil', 'Henry', 'Crawford.In', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'caustic', 'eye', 'situation', 'poor', 'relation', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'daughter', 'gently', 'born', 'lady', 'who', 'married', 'naval', 'officer', 'now', 'sunk', 'alcoholism', 'injury', 'life', 'shore', 'Portsmouth', 'Fanny', 'mother', 'two', 'sisters', 'Mrs.', 'Norris', 'who', 'married', 'clergyman', 'Lady', 'Bertram', 'wife', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'two', 'wind', 'off-handedly', 'bringing', 'Fanny', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'child', 'where', 'main', 'object', 'impress', 'how', 'inferior', 'status', 'cousins', 'how', 'grateful', 'should', 'be', 'dark', 'undertone', 'less', 'humor', 'situation', 'same', 'token', 'Fanny', 'eventual', 'triumph', 'much', 'larger.If', 'want', 'stars', 'glamor', 'go', 'elsewhere', 'money', 'best', 'most', 'faithful', 'rendering', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'observant', 'novel']",Mansfield Park VHS

I've just read the book so I know Aunt Norris' self-centered meanness, pivotal in our sympathies to Fanny do not suddenly develop half way through the book... and even worse, Fanny does not develop quiet intelligence and prettiness of her own suddenly half way through but it is there but ignored by everyone but Edmond.  This is a major flaw which changes in episode 4.A word of warning!  The characterization of Aunt Bertram with a whiny voice and insane expression is not only wrongly done but difficult to watch so ignore it if you can. It is the only major flaw of the production that lasts throughout.Once the actors were given a script that made sense in the second 3 episodes and the director figured out how to make the actors more appealing physically by camera angles, hair style etc, they did quite well whatever their flaws. Sir Thomas is especially good.This is the only Mansfield Park production fully worth watching.

What the...?!I don't give 2 straws if a movie is faithful to the original if the movie is funny...when it isn't supposed to be.Let's put aside the hideous wigs (Robin Langford's Mr. Yates' hair must simply be seen to be believed), the high school play-level sound, and the entire score that seems to be performed by a lone oboe player (the producer's kid, perhaps?).  This is a low-budget enterprise and that would be fine, if not for the SIMPLY. ATROCIOUS. ACTING.I really don't want to be unkind, but I paid good money to rent this movie and therefore feel quite comfortable saying that as Fannie Price, Le Touzel's acting makes Pauly Shore's acting look positively Shakespearesque.  It was so amateurish I was fascinated and like a train wreck, couldn't look away.The novel's Fannie was one of those goody-two-shoes that were prevalent in 19th-century literature (much like Polly Milton in Alcott's ""An Old-Fashioned Girl""), gliding through the novel with eyes lifted heavenward and hands folded in everlasting prayer, sanctimoniously condemning anything fun as sinful; well, maybe that is an exaggeration but you get the point. A real party girl, that one.My point is, Fannie is a rather boring character whose occupation in life appears to be spoiling fun whenever she happens upon it.  In the movie, Le Touzel definitely sticks to this characterization, which again, would be fine, but she seems to feel the need to make up for her character's lackluster personality by odd little movements accompanied by wide eyes, looking for all the world like she has just been given a wedgie.Angela Pleasense as Lady Bertram is puzzling...I didn't realize potheads existed in the early 19th century.  Picture Jeff Spicoli in a powdered pompadour wig and a lace shawl...that's Lady Bertram.This is not to say there wasn't any good acting to be found...Pug the dog was pretty good.Bernard Hepton as Sir Thomas was actually quite good, but I have to imagine he was looking desperately around  during filming and wondering if he could fake his own death to get out of this situation and save his career.My husband walked in while I was watching this and within 5 seconds, burst into laughter.  Admittedly, he is not exactly a connoisseur of British high drama, but he knows a hack job when he sees one.All in all, if you are looking for elegant, well-done drama, look elsewhere.  This is quite fun to mock; however, I can only take so much fun and a case of the gout would be preferable to seeing this again.",1,Reviews with FIVE Stars?!

228917,A3FBZDOS0SKVIJ,6300249824,Paulina S,"[8, 9]","This 1980's version of ""Mansfield Park"" is much truer to the novel than either the 1999 movie or the 2007 TV adaptation of the same name.  Unfortunately, this doesn't mean it's any better. It's just bad in its own, odd way.The most jarring element in this production is Sylvestra Le Touzel's portrayal of Fanny Price. Le Touzel, looking like a Victorian doll or a DW Griffith star, acts as if Fanny just escaped from a mental ward--or should be in one. Throughout the series she makes strange little slashes with her hands whenever she talks.  I think this is supposed to show her earnestness, but instead it starts to look as if she's practicing some bizarre sort of kung fu or as if she's patting an invisible dog.Austen's Fanny Price is gentle, repressed, but upright. Instead, Le Touzel alternates between cold blankness, hysteria (she becomes so shrill and gibbering during her scene with Sir Thomas I ended up fastforwarding the scene), and abruptly shouted ""No's"", making it impossible to understand why so many characters find her endearing. She is both erratic and insufferable. (Le Touzel later redeemed herself as the comic, clothes-minded Mrs. Allen in ""Northanger Abbey"").Most of the other characters, with the exception of Angela Pleasence's deranged Lady Bertram, are well done. Cinematic Mary Crawfords have always fared better than cinematic Fanny Prices, and Jackie Smith-Wood brings wit and warmth to the role.  Bernard Hepton gives Sir Thomas the right amount of gravitas and graciousness. Nicholas Farrell, a longtime favorite, is also very good as Edmund Bertram, despite that character's occasional pomposity.In staying scrupulously faithful to the novel, the script includes virtually all the novel's dialogue, to the detriment of pacing and plot. It PLODS until two thirds of the way through, when it suddenly picks up speed and interest, to the point of cramming in too many events and resolutions all at once.Like so many other reviewers, I am still hoping for a ""Mansfield Park"" that stays true to Austen's characters while streamlining the story and mining all the humor that exists within the text.",2,Only for the Die-Hardiest of Jane Austen fans,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,2128,"['1980', 'version', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'much', 'truer', 'novel', '1999', 'movie', '2007', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'same', 'name', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'mean', 'better', 'just', 'bad', 'own', 'odd', 'way.The', 'most', 'jarring', 'element', 'production', 'Sylvestra', 'Le', 'Touzel', 'portrayal', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'Le', 'Touzel', 'looking', 'Victorian', 'doll', 'DW', 'Griffith', 'star', 'Fanny', 'just', 'escaped', 'mental', 'ward', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'series', 'strange', 'little', 'slashes', 'hands', 'whenever', 'think', 'supposed', 'show', 'earnestness', 'instead', 'look', 'practicing', 'bizarre', 'sort', 'kung', 'fu', 'patting', 'invisible', 'dog.Austen', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'gentle', 'repressed', 'upright', 'Instead', 'Le', 'Touzel', 'cold', 'blankness', 'hysteria', 'so', 'shrill', 'gibbering', 'scene', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'ended', 'up', 'fastforwarding', 'scene', 'abruptly', 'shouted', ""'s"", 'making', 'impossible', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'find', 'endearing', 'erratic', 'insufferable', 'Le', 'Touzel', 'later', 'redeemed', 'comic', 'clothes-minded', 'Mrs.', 'Allen', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', '.Most', 'other', 'characters', 'exception', 'Angela', 'Pleasence', 'deranged', 'Lady', 'Bertram', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'Cinematic', 'Mary', 'Crawfords', 'have', 'always', 'fared', 'better', 'cinematic', 'Fanny', 'Prices', 'Jackie', 'Smith-Wood', 'wit', 'warmth', 'role', 'Bernard', 'Hepton', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'right', 'amount', 'gravitas', 'graciousness', 'Nicholas', 'Farrell', 'longtime', 'favorite', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Edmund', 'Bertram', 'character', 'occasional', 'pomposity.In', 'staying', 'scrupulously', 'faithful', 'novel', 'script', 'virtually', 'novel', 'dialogue', 'detriment', 'pacing', 'plot', 'PLODS', 'two', 'thirds', 'way', 'when', 'suddenly', 'up', 'speed', 'interest', 'point', 'cramming', 'too', 'many', 'events', 'resolutions', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'am', 'still', 'hoping', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'true', 'Austen', 'characters', 'streamlining', 'story', 'mining', 'humor', 'text']",Mansfield Park VHS
228918,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6300249824,"Promise ""promise""","[7, 10]","I expected much more from this BBC production of a Jane Austin novel but I still found a lot to enjoy.  It was very slow and after so much suffering, the happy ending came much too quickly.My main problem was with the acting.  I am a huge fan of British actors and this was the first time I was bothered by any of their performances.  I don't know if it was the fault of the individuals, actually, or that of the director.  The main example is that of Aunt Bertram, a frail woman who spends most of her time on the couch hugging her dog.  I don't know how Jane Austen wrote her but I doubt that it was as close to ""insane"" as this actress portrayed her. (Think Blanche duBois from A Streetcar Named Desire.)  Her speech and behavior was so strange as to seem bizarre and it didn't further the plot; it called attention to itself and was distracting.  It was also hard to hear her words and I would have appreciated subtitles.The other really over-the-top performance was that of Fanny's father,  a rip-roaring drunk that would have gotten gold stars in an acting class, but here, again, it just stuck out like a sore thumb.  Likewise his makeup---he sported the reddest nose this side of Ronald MacDonald, and again, it was so surprising, that it detracted from the story.  It was also highly unbelievable that his wife was so healthy and beautiful after all those years with such a drunken slob, (who brags that he believes in wife beating) and with all those wild kids!I thought that Fanny was well cast but the actress engaged in some physical mannerisms that were off-putting, mostly the way she tensed up her arms and chopped them in the air whenever she was upset, which was frequently. True, she was supposed to be an awkward teenager but again, it called attention to itself.  This is something any good director could have remedied.  Other than that, she had the requisite air of reticence and unfailing virtue that the part required.  I liked the way she looked; her lack of obvious beauty made her more interesting than prettier women, especially in the few scenes where she did show some color.Edmund was equally well-cast.  He was very believable as the future parson who was entranced by the more sophisticated and beautiful Mary Crawford, but who eventurally comes to his senses.  He looked right, too--not quite handsome with that huge nose, but still with a sort of nobility that shone through his extreme features.The actress who plays Mary Crawford was very good, I thought, portraying a complex woman who had some genuine goodness in her, but was undone by her own love of glamour and money.  Yes, her wig was awful, but so was the wig of Lord Bertram...(who did these wigs?)  Her brother who was supposed to be a big lady killer was badly cast.  The actor did a good enough job but he was so physically unattractive that he was never convincing. Sir Thomas Bertram was well done, humane and charming and stern when necessary..very much the Lord of the Manor.I have one complaint about the packaging of the DVD.  It features Fanny and Edmund, holding hands, so I knew, before I opened the box how it was going to end.  This really spoiled any surprise for me.However the story was still basically a good one and there is plenty of visual enjoyment.  There is a certain magic in these BBC adaptations of the classics that still came across here, in spite of its flaws.  Maybe it's just seeing the splendor of a lost era - the great houses, the costumes, the lush rose gardens, the immaculate horse carriages.  Maybe it's the glimpse into the mind of a great moralist, Jane Austin, for whom virtue always wins over vice!  For that alone, it's worth watching.",3,Not quite up to snuff - but still enjoyable,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,3676,"['expected', 'much', 'more', 'BBC', 'production', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'novel', 'still', 'found', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'so', 'much', 'suffering', 'happy', 'ending', 'came', 'much', 'too', 'quickly.My', 'main', 'problem', 'was', 'acting', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'British', 'actors', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'bothered', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'fault', 'individuals', 'actually', 'director', 'main', 'example', 'Aunt', 'Bertram', 'frail', 'woman', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'couch', 'hugging', 'dog', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'doubt', 'was', 'as', 'close', 'insane', 'actress', 'portrayed', 'Think', 'Blanche', 'duBois', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'speech', 'behavior', 'was', 'so', 'strange', 'seem', 'bizarre', 'did', ""n't"", 'further', 'plot', 'called', 'attention', 'was', 'distracting', 'was', 'also', 'hard', 'hear', 'words', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'subtitles.The', 'other', 'really', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'was', 'Fanny', 'father', 'rip-roaring', 'drunk', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'gold', 'stars', 'acting', 'class', 'here', 'again', 'just', 'stuck', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'Likewise', 'makeup', 'sported', 'reddest', 'nose', 'side', 'Ronald', 'MacDonald', 'again', 'was', 'so', 'surprising', 'detracted', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'highly', 'unbelievable', 'wife', 'was', 'so', 'healthy', 'beautiful', 'years', 'drunken', 'slob', 'who', 'wife', 'beating', 'wild', 'kids', 'thought', 'Fanny', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'actress', 'engaged', 'physical', 'mannerisms', 'were', 'off-putting', 'mostly', 'way', 'tensed', 'up', 'arms', 'chopped', 'air', 'whenever', 'was', 'upset', 'was', 'frequently', 'True', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'awkward', 'teenager', 'again', 'called', 'attention', 'something', 'good', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'remedied', 'Other', 'had', 'requisite', 'air', 'reticence', 'unfailing', 'virtue', 'part', 'required', 'liked', 'way', 'looked', 'lack', 'obvious', 'beauty', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'prettier', 'women', 'especially', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'did', 'show', 'color.Edmund', 'was', 'equally', 'well-cast', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'future', 'parson', 'who', 'was', 'entranced', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'beautiful', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'who', 'eventurally', 'senses', 'looked', 'right', 'too', 'not', 'quite', 'handsome', 'huge', 'nose', 'still', 'sort', 'nobility', 'shone', 'extreme', 'features.The', 'actress', 'who', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'thought', 'portraying', 'complex', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'genuine', 'goodness', 'was', 'undone', 'own', 'love', 'glamour', 'money', 'Yes', 'wig', 'was', 'awful', 'so', 'was', 'wig', 'Lord', 'Bertram', 'who', 'did', 'wigs', 'brother', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'big', 'lady', 'killer', 'was', 'badly', 'cast', 'actor', 'did', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'was', 'so', 'physically', 'unattractive', 'was', 'never', 'convincing', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Bertram', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'humane', 'charming', 'stern', 'when', 'necessary..very', 'much', 'Lord', 'Manor.I', 'have', 'one', 'complaint', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'Fanny', 'Edmund', 'holding', 'hands', 'knew', 'opened', 'box', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'really', 'spoiled', 'surprise', 'me.However', 'story', 'was', 'still', 'basically', 'good', 'one', 'plenty', 'visual', 'enjoyment', 'certain', 'magic', 'BBC', 'adaptations', 'classics', 'still', 'came', 'here', 'spite', 'flaws', 'Maybe', 'just', 'seeing', 'splendor', 'lost', 'era', 'great', 'houses', 'costumes', 'lush', 'rose', 'gardens', 'immaculate', 'horse', 'carriages', 'Maybe', 'glimpse', 'mind', 'great', 'moralist', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'whom', 'virtue', 'always', 'over', 'vice', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching']",Mansfield Park VHS

Mary is supposed to be beautiful, but to hear Jackie Smith-Wood referred to as such is clearly a joke. Politely put, the woman was homely. And while more complex than Embeth Davitz version, there was no sense of the betrayal of values that causes Edmond to leave her. As far as Robert (as Henry) he seemed more snivelling than charming. And his overbite made his attempt at charm agonizing to watch.On the flip side, Sylvestra Le Touzel's Fanny was quite and shy, as I felt Jane meant Fanny to be, while Angela Pleasence's sleepy Lady Bertram was brilliant (my opinion, as some have found her voice annoying). Here the sense of superiority tempered with eventually love (especially at the point of Fanny's refusal to marry Crawford)is much more believable.Again on the up side, we aren't force to watch the 'polically correct' sermonizing about the non-existant subplot on slavery, that the 1999 version tosses us from the director's soap box.",4,Better than the 1999 version,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,1198,"['screenplay', 'being', 'lightyears', 'better', '1999', 'version', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'A', 'E', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Thompson', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Paltrow', 'Emma.The', 'greater', 'part', 'films', 'failure', 'was', 'casting', 'Crawfords', 'Mary', 'supposed', 'be', 'beautiful', 'hear', 'Jackie', 'Smith-Wood', 'referred', 'such', 'clearly', 'joke', 'Politely', 'put', 'woman', 'was', 'homely', 'more', 'complex', 'Embeth', 'Davitz', 'version', 'was', 'sense', 'betrayal', 'values', 'Edmond', 'leave', 'As', 'far', 'Robert', 'Henry', 'seemed', 'more', 'snivelling', 'charming', 'overbite', 'made', 'attempt', 'charm', 'agonizing', 'watch.On', 'flip', 'side', 'Sylvestra', 'Le', 'Touzel', 'Fanny', 'was', 'quite', 'shy', 'felt', 'Jane', 'meant', 'Fanny', 'be', 'Angela', 'Pleasence', 'sleepy', 'Lady', 'Bertram', 'was', 'brilliant', 'opinion', 'have', 'found', 'voice', 'annoying', 'Here', 'sense', 'superiority', 'tempered', 'eventually', 'love', 'especially', 'point', 'Fanny', 'refusal', 'marry', 'Crawford', 'much', 'more', 'believable.Again', 'up', 'side', 'are', ""n't"", 'force', 'watch', ""'polically"", 'correct', 'sermonizing', 'non-existant', 'subplot', 'slavery', '1999', 'version', 'tosses', 'director', 'soap', 'box']",Mansfield Park VHS
