1623577,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00BATGDCO,Micheal Hunt,"[3, 5]","I, like many others, have waited years for this to finally get released. However, I was expecting it would be the classic sketches the duo did on the CD's, but surprisingly it seems like it was re-recorded old material, but they left the really good bits out, or used sketches that where not their best material. For god sakes, it's 2013, quit trying to make movies that wont offend or can be watched by small teens. Most of this almost seemed PG rated, if dope was a family thing to watch.We already have had the best sketch by Cheech and Chong in their first movie Up In Smoke. We got a slightly re-worked version in Hey Watch This, and of coarse their has always been the album recorded version. Yet half of it has been cut out and watered down for the cartoon version. Why? If shows like South Park or Drawn Together can push every boundary of what is seen in cartoons on TV, then why not just go all the way for a straight to home video release? It really felt like so much of the material on this cartoon movie was holding back, and not reaching the potential it could have had.It is good to HEAR Cheech & Chong after all these years, but this cartoon movie that has taken so long to get released just did not come anywhere near as funny as I expected it to be. Heck, it's probably only one step up on Corsican Brothers, so I'd rather watch just about any other C&C; video over this.It's not to say it's all bad, it had a few good moments. But some things like Ralph & Herby work much better as two dudes on stage, rather than actually being dog characters. Then their a few background things that just make you wonder why they bothered, and just about every sketch worked better on the albums or movies then it did as a visual cartoon.",2,Pretty Disapointing,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,1742,"['many', 'others', 'have', 'waited', 'years', 'finally', 'get', 'released', 'However', 'was', 'expecting', 'would', 'be', 'classic', 'duo', 'did', 'CD', 'surprisingly', 'was', 're-recorded', 'old', 'material', 'left', 'really', 'good', 'bits', 'out', 'used', 'sketches', 'where', 'not', 'best', 'material', 'god', 'sakes', '2013', 'quit', 'trying', 'make', 'movies', 'wont', 'offend', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'small', 'teens', 'Most', 'almost', 'seemed', 'PG', 'rated', 'dope', 'was', 'family', 'thing', 'watch.We', 'already', 'have', 'had', 'best', 'sketch', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'first', 'movie', 'Up', 'Smoke', 'got', 'slightly', 're-worked', 'version', 'Hey', 'Watch', 'coarse', 'always', 'been', 'album', 'recorded', 'version', 'half', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'watered', 'down', 'cartoon', 'version', 'Why', 'shows', 'South', 'Park', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'can', 'push', 'boundary', 'what', 'seen', 'cartoons', 'TV', 'then', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'go', 'way', 'straight', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'really', 'felt', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'was', 'holding', 'back', 'not', 'reaching', 'potential', 'could', 'have', 'had.It', 'good', 'HEAR', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'years', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'released', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'anywhere', 'as', 'funny', 'expected', 'be', 'Heck', 'probably', 'only', 'one', 'step', 'up', 'Corsican', 'Brothers', 'so', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'just', 'other', 'C', 'C', 'video', 'this.It', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'had', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'things', 'Ralph', 'Herby', 'work', 'much', 'better', 'two', 'dudes', 'stage', 'rather', 'actually', 'being', 'dog', 'characters', 'Then', 'few', 'background', 'things', 'just', 'make', 'wonder', 'why', 'bothered', 'just', 'sketch', 'worked', 'better', 'albums', 'movies', 'then', 'did', 'visual', 'cartoon']",Cheech & Chong's: Animated Movie
