1256629,A3FLDKR3BBTGB1,B002945DVG,Brock Stevens,"[45, 46]","I thought this was a great documentary, originally released in 1971, directed by Peter Bogdanovich, and Narrated by Orson Welles. This documentary aired on TCM in 2006 and the viewers went CRAZY, it was #5 or #6 on their list of films most requested to be on DVD. I recorded it on VHS back in '06, and will be buying this commercial release in September. This documentary has interviews with John Ford (Of Coarse), John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg... (Eastwood, Scorsese, and Speilberg's interviews were added in 2006 when Bogdanovich re-cut it, along with some other footage that was not in the original 1971 release.) I don't suggest this documentary for everyone, if you are an avid movie fan (Like Me) who enjoys seeing people reflect on their careers and other stars telling stories about things that happened on movie sets then you'll love it as I do, but if you aren't interested in such types of documentaries than this is not for you. Also, if you are a HUGE John Ford fan seek out Mr. Ford's AFI Salute (Only on VHS at this time).",4,"Directed By John Ford (1971) (2006),  110m.",1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,1101,"['thought', 'was', 'great', 'documentary', 'originally', 'released', '1971', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'Narrated', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'documentary', 'aired', 'TCM', '2006', 'viewers', 'went', 'CRAZY', 'was', '5', '6', 'list', 'films', 'most', 'requested', 'be', 'DVD', 'recorded', 'VHS', 'back', ""'06"", 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'commercial', 'release', 'September', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'John', 'Ford', 'Coarse', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Eastwood', 'Scorsese', 'Speilberg', 'interviews', 'were', 'added', '2006', 'when', 'Bogdanovich', 're-cut', 'other', 'footage', 'was', 'not', 'original', '1971', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'documentary', 'everyone', 'are', 'avid', 'movie', 'fan', 'Me', 'who', 'seeing', 'people', 'reflect', 'careers', 'other', 'stars', 'telling', 'stories', 'things', 'happened', 'movie', 'sets', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'do', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'such', 'types', 'documentaries', 'not', 'Also', 'are', 'HUGE', 'John', 'Ford', 'fan', 'seek', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Ford', 'AFI', 'Salute', 'Only', 'VHS', 'time']",Directed by John Ford

John Ford was a difficult and secretive artist who made films which covered the entire American experience and then some. Providing a patriotic vision of America, Ford's work is uplifting and accepting of the history of the country despite its faults.Bogdanovich provides revealing interviews with Ford intimates, John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Henry Fonda, James Stewart, and Harry Carey Jr. He also, somewhat later in time, collected the thoughts of directors influenced by Ford, such as Martin Scorcese, Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood and Walter Hill. Bogdanovich is able to paint a portrait of an artist with a clear vision of what he wants to say and how, as well as a temperamental and maddening man who had many sides to his personality.

Most documentaries from several years back ,  much less 30 feature ""talking heads"" hopelessly faded and poorly lit and in general dating the project. Well...this documentary ..or this version opens with current day interviews with Clint Eastwood and Spielberg and Walter Hill and when it moves to the interviews with Henry Fonda,  James Stewart and John Wayne....there is NO drop off in the image quality in fact the older interviews appear to be on film, lit by a pro cinematographer and are a revelation for the open and frank  discussions  these folks engage  in  with Mr  Bogdonavich. Most  all of the footage from  the films  discussed seems to be  current re-mastered digital  prints so I'd say this is the singular best  example of  updating a classic documentary I've ever enjoyed  and  I love  documentaries.  Mr Bogdonavich knows the territory and is a brilliant director himself...as well as author and actor. This is a couple of hours I will watch over and over and over.

1256635,AZN1M6C87366Z,B002945DVG,RICH,"[1, 1]","The background of this documentary is interesting.  Director Peter Bogdanovich put it together some thirty-odd years ago, narrated by Orson Welles, then later did a re-edit, inserting additional interview footage featuring the likes of Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese.I--and probably thousands of others--am happy he did the update. It's important, because Ford films and what they represent are still relevant, and this updating helps introduce the man and his movies to a younger generation. This possible objective is, I suspect, the reason Bogdanovich dwells repeatedly on some movies at the cost of including others.  The two most obvious remain, today, the most popular and well-known works in the man's canon: The Searchers and How Green Was My Valley, movies that would be at least vaguely familiar to those under 40. They serve as good touchstones, as introduced--in part--by three well-known movie-makers still creating excellent cinema: Eastwood, Scorsese and Walter Hill, still active as producer(Prometheus)and director (TV mini-series, Broken Trail.)Bogdanovich's interview with Ford is a classic in its own right, and his interview with John Wayne reveals as much about Duke as Ford. Here, Wayne is an articulate man of some charm, wit and insight. Learn, too, how Ford's clever ploys goaded actors to produce some of their best work. Watch, especially, the long single, one-camera take recording the spirited dialogue exchange between veterans Jimmy Stewart and Richard Widmark.  Fabulous.It helps, too, if you've read something about the man, his methods and madness (yeah, like most creative people, Ford had his demons.)  If you do, you will be intrigued by what this documentary does NOT include.  You won't hear anything about how hard it was to be Ford's production-assistant son, Patrick (not interviewed.)  Two legendary movie stars and Ford favourites--Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara--ARE interviewed, but neither reveals Ford's physical violence. He slugged them both in the face at different times; O'Hara's abuse occurred publicly, in front of dozens of film people.  You won't hear a word about that, or, how others risked coming to John Wayne's defence when Ford continually and viciously harassed and belittled him. Wayne's usual retort: ""Awww, Pappy...""So, as Bogdanovich claims, while Ford may have ""printed the truth NOT the legend,"" through his movies, the same isn't entirely true of this documentary, which is, in the end, a good-natured reminiscence on the legendary film director.",4,"A GOOD INTRODUCION TO THE LEGENDARY FILM-MAKER, BUT...",1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,2522,"['background', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'put', 'together', 'thirty-odd', 'years', 'ago', 'narrated', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'then', 'later', 'did', 're-edit', 'inserting', 'additional', 'interview', 'footage', 'featuring', 'likes', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Martin', 'Scorsese.I', 'probably', 'thousands', 'others', 'am', 'happy', 'did', 'update', 'important', 'Ford', 'films', 'what', 'represent', 'are', 'still', 'relevant', 'updating', 'introduce', 'man', 'movies', 'younger', 'generation', 'possible', 'objective', 'suspect', 'reason', 'Bogdanovich', 'repeatedly', 'movies', 'cost', 'including', 'others', 'two', 'most', 'obvious', 'remain', 'today', 'most', 'popular', 'well-known', 'works', 'man', 'canon', 'Searchers', 'How', 'Green', 'Was', 'My', 'Valley', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'vaguely', 'familiar', '40', 'serve', 'good', 'touchstones', 'introduced', 'part', 'three', 'well-known', 'movie-makers', 'still', 'creating', 'excellent', 'cinema', 'Eastwood', 'Scorsese', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'still', 'active', 'producer', 'Prometheus', 'director', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'Broken', 'Trail', 'Bogdanovich', 'interview', 'Ford', 'classic', 'own', 'right', 'interview', 'John', 'Wayne', 'as', 'much', 'Duke', 'Ford', 'Here', 'Wayne', 'articulate', 'man', 'charm', 'wit', 'insight', 'Learn', 'too', 'how', 'Ford', 'clever', 'goaded', 'actors', 'produce', 'best', 'work', 'Watch', 'especially', 'long', 'single', 'one-camera', 'take', 'recording', 'spirited', 'dialogue', 'exchange', 'veterans', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'Fabulous.It', 'too', ""'ve"", 'read', 'something', 'man', 'methods', 'madness', 'yeah', 'most', 'creative', 'people', 'Ford', 'had', 'demons', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'intrigued', 'what', 'documentary', 'NOT', 'include', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'anything', 'how', 'hard', 'was', 'be', 'Ford', 'production-assistant', 'son', 'Patrick', 'not', 'interviewed', 'Two', 'legendary', 'movie', 'stars', 'Ford', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'ARE', 'interviewed', 'reveals', 'Ford', 'physical', 'violence', 'slugged', 'face', 'different', 'times', ""O'Hara"", 'abuse', 'occurred', 'publicly', 'front', 'dozens', 'film', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'word', 'how', 'others', 'risked', 'coming', 'John', 'Wayne', 'defence', 'when', 'Ford', 'continually', 'viciously', 'harassed', 'belittled', 'Wayne', 'usual', 'retort', 'Awww', 'Pappy', 'So', 'Bogdanovich', 'Ford', 'may', 'have', 'printed', 'truth', 'NOT', 'legend', 'movies', 'same', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'true', 'documentary', 'end', 'good-natured', 'reminiscence', 'legendary', 'film', 'director']",Directed by John Ford

In a way, I'm glad I missed seeing it on TCM--on DVD, the re-edit of the original plus the improved quality of the clips makes it like meeting an old love and finding her more beautiful than ever.The interview material added since 1971 (particularly Maureen O'Hara's 1992 contribution) really helps to explain why Ford was so hilariously contrarian in his original contact with Bogdonovich.  There is a much fuller sense of John Ford as a person than in the original film.  Spielberg, Eastwood, Scorsese and others help place his work in an artistic context.But the real thrill of the film is in the clips themselves.  Bogdonovich had just done his first feature, a B-movie starring Boris Karloff, and would go on to make three masterpieces in a row.  DIRECTED BY JOHN FORD, falling in the midst of this progression, is really like a piece of found art, in which he lovingly assembles pieces of Ford's films to make something entirely his own.  The talking head portions are beautifully shot on 35mm, and fit seamlessly into the material of the clips.  Also, to listen to Fonda, Stewart, and Wayne is to appreciate how skilled they all are as raconteurs.DIRECTED BY JOHN FORD calls attention to the irony that is so easily overlooked in Ford's films, and makes a point of showing Ford to be not so much a chronicler of American History as an archivist of the myths and rituals of American History.Even for those not fully convinced of Ford's genius, this documentary is a valuable primer on how to understand film art.
