It's an ok documentary of that time but the way it is being marketed borders on misrepresentation. If you want to see or hear these bands go elsewhere. Very disappointing.,1,Waste of money,1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,307,"['was', 'stunned', 'see', 'how', 'little', 'footage', 'bands', 'was', 'DVD', 'especially', 'description', 'touted', 'so', 'much', 'ok', 'documentary', 'time', 'way', 'being', 'marketed', 'borders', 'misrepresentation', 'want', 'see', 'hear', 'bands', 'go', 'elsewhere', 'Very', 'disappointing']",Rockin' at the Red Dog: The Dawn of Psychedelic Rock

'Rockin' At The Red Dog' DVD is aimed to showcase the late '60's psychedelic era - as it was in San Francisco. Quite an interesting line-up I have to admit - like for example Quicksilver Messenger Service, the pre-Janis Joplin line-up of Big Brother & The Holding Company, the Grateful Dead, the folk rockers the Charlatans as well as some lesser-known artists from that time  such as Final Solutions, the somewhat eccentric Dan Hicks (who notably plays country, rock and some swing) and Lynn Hughes. Do keep in mind that this isn't a concert DVD, it's documentary (there's a difference).

This DVD is a documentary that digs deep into the origins of the 1960s Haight-Ashbury counterculture. This is a story of Beatniks transforming into countercultural artists and the culture that develops out of a Virginia City, Nevada saloon. This DVD features Big Brother and the Holding Company when the group first began, as well as The charlatans, and more. These artists and individualists created a new culture and a new prototype society on the streets and in the Red Dog Saloon.

(A night at the family dog or the Grateful Dead movie might be a better choice)  If you'd like to get an inside glimpse of the San Francisco sound then this dvd is the one to buy.  The background of this type of music is unmatched.  They mainly focus on the Charaltans but they talk about all of them that took part in making this movement happen.  There are many individualists, some musicians, artists and promoters that are interviewed.I rate it 5 stars based on actual footage and photos that took place back in the day.
