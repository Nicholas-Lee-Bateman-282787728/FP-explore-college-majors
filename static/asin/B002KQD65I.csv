Foster ""movie buff""","[4, 8]",An animal expert and homicide police investigator are sent to France to investigate the murders caused by a savage beast from 1764.

1275327,AC06F0LPHI1TW,B002KQD65I,K Scheffler,"[0, 0]","I found the program to be better than I had expected - the locals do seem to have amassed a considerable amount of documentation about the 'phenomena' (or 'mass murder') and it seems that the ""investigators"" did take the varying (and sometimes conflicting) information into consideration.  So the program is not about proving that the killings had to be perpetrated by a so-called wolfman. Nevertheless, trying to investigate something like this some 250 years after the events took place is problematic, and sure enough at time the program gets a little ludicrous - and the conclusion itself is fairly speculative.  So if the local hero Jean Chastel in fact had a role to play in all of this, then in effect he was a mass murderer -- no wonder the ""distant relative"" who was roped into participating in the program usually had a pained expression. These Americans were intent on mauling his legendary ancestor's reputation and there was nothing he could do but go along with it. What I also found interesting was that the role that the Catholic church played in this was categorically dismissed. Would the Catholic church - or more likely, some people in it at the local level - been above perpetrating such a horror? Given its past history of Inquisition and persecution: absolutely not. But here again, no proof - if it even exists, it will never see the light of day -- means that this can only remain speculation and therefore is no better than the conclusion that the two ""investigators"" reach. In the end we have to accept that we can never really know the truth - but this of course doesn't make for interesting TV.",3,"Interesting subject, dubious ""history""",1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,1623,"['found', 'program', 'be', 'better', 'had', 'expected', 'locals', 'do', 'seem', 'have', 'amassed', 'considerable', 'amount', 'documentation', ""'phenomena"", ""'mass"", 'murder', 'investigators', 'did', 'take', 'varying', 'sometimes', 'conflicting', 'information', 'consideration', 'program', 'not', 'proving', 'killings', 'had', 'be', 'perpetrated', 'so-called', 'wolfman', 'Nevertheless', 'trying', 'investigate', 'something', '250', 'years', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'problematic', 'sure', 'enough', 'time', 'program', 'little', 'ludicrous', 'conclusion', 'fairly', 'speculative', 'So', 'local', 'hero', 'Jean', 'Chastel', 'fact', 'had', 'role', 'play', 'then', 'effect', 'was', 'mass', 'murderer', 'wonder', 'distant', 'relative', 'who', 'was', 'roped', 'participating', 'program', 'usually', 'had', 'pained', 'expression', 'Americans', 'were', 'intent', 'mauling', 'legendary', 'ancestor', 'reputation', 'was', 'nothing', 'could', 'do', 'go', 'along', 'What', 'also', 'found', 'interesting', 'was', 'role', 'Catholic', 'church', 'played', 'was', 'categorically', 'dismissed', 'Would', 'Catholic', 'church', 'more', 'likely', 'people', 'local', 'level', 'been', 'perpetrating', 'horror', 'Given', 'past', 'history', 'Inquisition', 'persecution', 'absolutely', 'not', 'here', 'again', 'proof', 'even', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'can', 'only', 'remain', 'speculation', 'therefore', 'better', 'conclusion', 'two', 'investigators', 'reach', 'end', 'have', 'accept', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'truth', 'course', ""n't"", 'make', 'interesting', 'TV']",N/A

Its my favorite monster story for those of us who believe such things still exist. But the investigation kind of goes sour when they use a 44 marlin rifle to replicate silver ballistics. Such shots should be taken with a muzzleloader loaded with a round ball, preferablly patched, a smoothbore most likely the tool of the French peasant. They also didnt take into account that Chastel could have lied about using a silver bullet in his actual weapon upon firing. Its a terrifying documentary that one needs to watch.
