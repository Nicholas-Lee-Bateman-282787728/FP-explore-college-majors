Anyway, it's up to 2 miscast actors playing detectives to unmask the killer.  Basic stuff.This one tries to be more of a police thriller than a slasher flick(not a wise move), though all the trappings are in place for  an old school horror bloodbath.  You've got your bikini bimbos, a masked killer, and a fair amount of blood; yet this falls short of being a satisfying outing.  I guess the main problem is that the victims solely exist to be offed.  We have no emotional attatchment to any of them.  Too much time is spent on the detectives and their investigation.Oh, well.  Nobody really goes into these movies expecting to be knocked out of their seat.  They go to be entertained, which this film manages to do at least some of the time.",3,Was Anybody Really Expecting a Great Movie???,1078444800,"03 5, 2004",2004,865,"['Pretty', 'typical', 'B-movie', 'fare', 'Sorority', 'girls', 'are', 'being', 'bumped', 'off', '5', 'Year', 'Reunion', 'anyone', 'would', 'actually', 'go', 'Anyway', '2', 'miscast', 'actors', 'playing', 'detectives', 'unmask', 'killer', 'Basic', 'stuff.This', 'one', 'tries', 'be', 'more', 'police', 'thriller', 'slasher', 'flick', 'not', 'wise', 'move', 'trappings', 'are', 'place', 'old', 'school', 'horror', 'bloodbath', ""'ve"", 'got', 'bikini', 'bimbos', 'masked', 'killer', 'fair', 'amount', 'blood', 'short', 'being', 'satisfying', 'outing', 'guess', 'main', 'problem', 'victims', 'solely', 'exist', 'be', 'offed', 'have', 'emotional', 'attatchment', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'detectives', 'investigation.Oh', 'well', 'Nobody', 'really', 'movies', 'expecting', 'be', 'knocked', 'seat', 'go', 'be', 'entertained', 'film', 'do', 'least', 'time']",N/A

I admit I rented this movie to see some shots of Kari Wuhrer but I did not see any-just 5 other babes who could not act at all-this looked like a movie made by Playboy productions-plenty of bare breasted chicks but no substance.  What was Kari Wuhrer doing in this flop? At least she can act somewhat but in this one she seemed way above the rest of the cast because even her below par performance was far better than anyone else.  In addition there were no shots of her in this movie which added to the disappointment--don't try this movie-you will be very disappointed if you are a Kari Wuhrer fan-the fox did not show it at all----",1,What a DUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The director had these five &quot;babes&quot; so to speak, so he had to make sure they each got their nude scene accompanied by lounge lizard music. They caress their bodies, play with their boobies and do all kinds of stupid things, just to show off their anatomical gifts. It's so poorly done that it's not the least bit titillating, pardon the pun. Add to this that not one of the ladies can act (Debbie Rochon is as usual repulsive in her attempts). Kari Wuhrer and Brent Huff as the cops should be ashamed of themselves for participating in this quickie. The plot is as predictable as they come and the extra twists at the end are only good for snickers.If slasher films continue to degenerate into pablum like this clunker, the genre should be retired.

Luckily, this is the type of cheesy b-movie fare that one can sit back and enjoy.  Everything about it is absurd and it revels in it.The film starts out with a cop swindling some drug dealers.  He gets chased after they get wise.  The car chase is actually pretty decent but there's an added bonus: It changes from raining to not raining randomly.  Of course the cop catches hell from his boss (a character named Hugh Janus) as he's the rogue-ish type.  However, it was the cop who was being chased.  How can that be his fault?  Luckily, it doesn't matter in the least as the consequence is a transfer from the LAPD to Hawaii.  Cut to a scene of expository dialogue.  We soon find that a sorority is having its reunion on the Big Island.The bad-boy cop finds his new partner appealing.  How do we know this?  Because he fantasizes about her swimming!  They must now find out who is bumping off the sororstitutes before all of them bite it.  It shouldn't be too hard given that all of the clues point exactly to one person throughout the entire film. Through a series of events too stupid to recount, the killer is apprehended, or is he?  Or is she?  Or are they?The dialogue is better than say, Matrix: Revolutions but it isn't anything exceptional.  There are a few decent jokes (""It's pretty thin.""  ""Yeah it's downright bulimic."") to pass the time between sex scenes and lunacy.  The sex scenes are in no way erotic to anyone other than a fifteen-year-old male but like the rest of the film, they're fun.  One of them features a woman who walks like an android trying to walk sexy but the program isn't quite right so it comes off as terribly awkward instead.This films showcases; people who get bloodied and bruised for no good reason before a car chase; cops who can't hold guns; a family of revenge-driven psychos; gratuitous blood in one scene; name-dropping of b-film legends; and sorority girls on a five-year reunion.  Sounds like a winner to me.  The plot twists in this are as predictable as VH1's playlist yet in the last few moments the nonsense starts to pile up in a lovely fashion.  Each further twist to the film induces a groan but also a grin, as does much of the dialogue.  It's a pretty bad film but a great guilty pleasure.",4,"Aaaaaaahhhhhhh, cheese",1074297600,"01 17, 2004",2004,2315,"['film', 'took', 'seriously', 'would', 'have', 'problem', 'Luckily', 'type', 'cheesy', 'b-movie', 'fare', 'one', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'Everything', 'absurd', 'it.The', 'film', 'out', 'cop', 'swindling', 'drug', 'dealers', 'chased', 'get', 'wise', 'car', 'chase', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'added', 'bonus', 'raining', 'not', 'raining', 'randomly', 'course', 'cop', 'catches', 'hell', 'boss', 'character', 'named', 'Hugh', 'Janus', 'rogue-ish', 'type', 'However', 'was', 'cop', 'who', 'was', 'being', 'chased', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'fault', 'Luckily', ""n't"", 'matter', 'least', 'consequence', 'transfer', 'LAPD', 'Hawaii', 'Cut', 'scene', 'expository', 'dialogue', 'soon', 'find', 'sorority', 'having', 'reunion', 'Big', 'Island.The', 'bad-boy', 'cop', 'new', 'partner', 'appealing', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'swimming', 'must', 'now', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'bumping', 'off', 'sororstitutes', 'bite', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'given', 'clues', 'point', 'exactly', 'one', 'person', 'entire', 'film', 'series', 'events', 'too', 'stupid', 'recount', 'killer', 'apprehended', 'are', 'dialogue', 'better', 'say', 'Matrix', 'Revolutions', ""n't"", 'anything', 'exceptional', 'are', 'few', 'decent', 'jokes', 'pretty', 'thin', 'Yeah', 'downright', 'bulimic', 'pass', 'time', 'sex', 'scenes', 'lunacy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'way', 'erotic', 'anyone', 'other', 'fifteen-year-old', 'male', 'rest', 'film', ""'re"", 'fun', 'One', 'woman', 'who', 'android', 'trying', 'walk', 'sexy', 'program', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'off', 'terribly', 'instead.This', 'films', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'bloodied', 'bruised', 'good', 'reason', 'car', 'chase', 'cops', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'guns', 'family', 'revenge-driven', 'psychos', 'gratuitous', 'blood', 'one', 'scene', 'name-dropping', 'b-film', 'legends', 'sorority', 'girls', 'five-year', 'reunion', 'winner', 'plot', 'are', 'as', 'predictable', 'VH1', 'playlist', 'yet', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'nonsense', 'pile', 'up', 'lovely', 'fashion', 'further', 'twist', 'film', 'groan', 'also', 'grin', 'much', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'bad', 'film', 'great', 'guilty', 'pleasure']",N/A
773285,A2P5DZA3DQHQUA,B0000C2IWM,"OldSarge ""mijou1""","[1, 1]","If you saw Prom Night you saw the basic concept of Final Examination (2003). Prom Night saw a brother lose his sister and go on a killing spree. Final Exam takes the same plot and gives it a twist.  Girls from the smallest sorority in history are invited back to Hawaii for a magazine shoot, five years after they graduated. Rachel played by Jen Kikolaison drives her car off a unfinished road in the opening of the show. Remember, a brother or sister has to die, before the remaining sibling can go off the deep end. Then we get to see the girls in Hawaii and in the buff.  Most of the girls looked as if they made a stop on Nip/Tuck prior to doing this movie. Shane Newman played by Brent Huff is the should be washed up cop who gets transfered to Hawaii to partner with the beautiful Julia Seska played by Kari Wuhrer.  My question for Kari would be, were you just bored?  Megan Davidson played by Belinda Gavin, Amanda Galvin played by Kalau Iwaoka, and Kristen Neal played by Amy Lindsay make up the sorority crowd, along with Terri Walker played by Kim Maddox.  Derek Simmons played by Winton Nicholson is the deranged brother and owner of the magazine that is paying for the girls to come to Hawaii on what is supposed to be a magazine center fold shoot.  The photographer is Taylor Cameron played by Debbie Rochon who also turns out to be a sister of the dead girl.  Not really that bad of a B movie.  My hat went off to Kalau Iwaoka.
