For me it has been decades--waiting for a VHS, a CED disc, a laser or a DVD of this terrific movie. I've got the DVD-R and it is okay. There is some color shifting during dissolves between scenes but other than that this widescreen look at Edwards Air Force Base in the middle of its golden decade is sensational.

1435187,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,B00508W3MU,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[0, 0]","""We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.""-- President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1960If you're looking for what Eisenhower was talking about, this film might be a great place to start.Seriously, the Air Force lent so much ""help"" to Warner Bros; and the studio's access to Edwards Air Force Base and the latest, cutting-edge aircraft of the period is so complete, that The Air Force had effectively made Warner Bros Studio their propaganda arm. As circumstantial evidence, I submit that the Air Force surely approved the script, as well as providing truckloads of technical advice, fuel, and privileged access to everything they had going on over there. The cost of the technical support may well have exceeded the cost of the film itself.""Toward the Unknown"" is a sister film, as well, to Warner Bros' subsequent 1957 film, ""Bombers B-52"", where Warner's collaborated again with the Air Force to google over what was, at that time, America's largest mega-aircraft. The new Cinemascope was the perfect format to demonstrate to the public the awe-inspiring spectacle of America's latest WMD's.In the throes of the Cold War, America was ready to accept the message of these films, in which aerospace technology had ascended to the status of a religion...and Sputnik hadn't even happened yet. It was a heady time for the aerospace industry, especially in Southern California. I know, because my Dad was a mathematician for Rocketdyne, and aerospace played a ""strategic"" role in the California economy.What brought me to Toward the Unknown, however, was a burning desire to see every film Bill Holden ever made. However, for years the mysterious ""Toward The Unknown"" was tantalizingly unavailable, as it had never been released on home video. According to some sources, it was a rights issue with the Holden estate.The film is in Warnercolor, which was an early single-strip color format film process (as opposed to three strip technicolor, the previous industry standard), so the colors do look a bit strange, mostly strong in the red and blue records. Greens don't render  well, flesh tones look a bit off, and dissolves are often loaded with blurry grain and artifacts.However, the sound quality of this transfer is pretty good and has the feeling of mag film, not optical sound.William Holden, as test pilot Major Lincoln Bond, is trying to fight his way back into an Air Force career after being tortured by the North Koreans. They broke him, forcing a confession that provided a propaganda bonanza for the enemy. Now Bond is fighting for his reputation and career; but luckily his boss, General Banner, lets him get his foot in the door as a test pilot.After a series of struggles on the base, both personal and technical, Bond gradually works his way up to state-of-the-art rocket-powered aircraft. Holden fans will not be disappointed by his reserved, unassuming performance, but the script and supporting cast seem at times wooden. James Garner and Karen Steele (""Eve"" from ""Mudd's Women"") are fascinating to watch in their early roles, but Lloyd Nolan is leaden in his role as General Banner, lacking both the authority and sympathy necessary to bring the character to full fruition.The control tower and some other scenes on the airbase were achieved with an imperfect process screen of some type, such as sodium or blue screen.Still, it is a rare look at life on what was probably at that time America's most elite Air Force Base, where some of the most exciting research and development took place. For aerospace fans, this film is a mother lode. The aircraft have a pride of place in the story that exceeds that of the characters, if you don't mind that sort of thing. It is a showcase for America's military-industrial-aerospace complex during a unique and exploratory time in aviation history.",3,Major William Holden film from the 1950's finally released in 2011,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,3887,"['must', 'guard', 'acquisition', 'unwarranted', 'influence', 'sought', 'unsought', 'military', 'industrial', 'complex', 'President', 'Dwight', 'D.', 'Eisenhower', '1960If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'what', 'Eisenhower', 'was', 'talking', 'about', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'great', 'place', 'start.Seriously', 'Air', 'Force', 'lent', 'so', 'much', 'help', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'studio', 'access', 'Edwards', 'Air', 'Force', 'Base', 'latest', 'cutting-edge', 'aircraft', 'period', 'so', 'complete', 'Air', 'Force', 'had', 'effectively', 'made', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'Studio', 'propaganda', 'arm', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'submit', 'Air', 'Force', 'surely', 'approved', 'script', 'as', 'well', 'providing', 'truckloads', 'technical', 'advice', 'fuel', 'privileged', 'access', 'everything', 'had', 'going', 'there', 'cost', 'technical', 'support', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'exceeded', 'cost', 'film', 'Unknown', 'sister', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'subsequent', '1957', 'film', 'Bombers', 'B-52', 'where', 'Warner', 'collaborated', 'again', 'Air', 'Force', 'google', 'over', 'what', 'was', 'time', 'America', 'largest', 'mega-aircraft', 'new', 'Cinemascope', 'was', 'perfect', 'format', 'demonstrate', 'public', 'awe-inspiring', 'spectacle', 'America', 'latest', 'throes', 'Cold', 'War', 'America', 'was', 'ready', 'accept', 'message', 'films', 'aerospace', 'technology', 'had', 'ascended', 'status', 'religion', 'Sputnik', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'happened', 'yet', 'was', 'heady', 'time', 'aerospace', 'industry', 'especially', 'Southern', 'California', 'know', 'Dad', 'was', 'mathematician', 'Rocketdyne', 'aerospace', 'played', 'strategic', 'role', 'California', 'brought', 'Toward', 'Unknown', 'however', 'was', 'burning', 'desire', 'see', 'film', 'Bill', 'Holden', 'ever', 'made', 'However', 'years', 'mysterious', 'Unknown', 'was', 'tantalizingly', 'unavailable', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'home', 'video', 'According', 'sources', 'was', 'rights', 'issue', 'Holden', 'estate.The', 'film', 'Warnercolor', 'was', 'early', 'single-strip', 'color', 'format', 'film', 'process', 'opposed', 'three', 'strip', 'technicolor', 'previous', 'industry', 'standard', 'colors', 'do', 'look', 'bit', 'strange', 'mostly', 'strong', 'red', 'blue', 'records', 'Greens', 'do', ""n't"", 'render', 'well', 'flesh', 'tones', 'look', 'bit', 'dissolves', 'are', 'often', 'loaded', 'blurry', 'grain', 'artifacts.However', 'sound', 'quality', 'transfer', 'pretty', 'good', 'feeling', 'mag', 'film', 'not', 'optical', 'sound.William', 'Holden', 'test', 'pilot', 'Major', 'Lincoln', 'Bond', 'trying', 'fight', 'way', 'back', 'Air', 'Force', 'career', 'being', 'tortured', 'North', 'Koreans', 'broke', 'forcing', 'confession', 'provided', 'propaganda', 'bonanza', 'enemy', 'Now', 'Bond', 'fighting', 'reputation', 'career', 'luckily', 'boss', 'General', 'Banner', 'get', 'foot', 'door', 'test', 'pilot.After', 'series', 'struggles', 'base', 'personal', 'technical', 'Bond', 'gradually', 'way', 'state-of-the-art', 'rocket-powered', 'aircraft', 'Holden', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'reserved', 'unassuming', 'performance', 'script', 'supporting', 'cast', 'seem', 'times', 'wooden', 'James', 'Garner', 'Karen', 'Steele', 'Eve', 'Mudd', 'Women', 'are', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'early', 'roles', 'Lloyd', 'Nolan', 'leaden', 'role', 'General', 'Banner', 'lacking', 'authority', 'sympathy', 'necessary', 'bring', 'character', 'full', 'fruition.The', 'control', 'tower', 'other', 'scenes', 'airbase', 'were', 'achieved', 'imperfect', 'process', 'screen', 'type', 'such', 'sodium', 'blue', 'screen.Still', 'rare', 'look', 'life', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'time', 'America', 'most', 'elite', 'Air', 'Force', 'Base', 'where', 'most', 'exciting', 'research', 'development', 'took', 'place', 'aerospace', 'fans', 'film', 'mother', 'lode', 'aircraft', 'have', 'pride', 'place', 'story', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sort', 'thing', 'showcase', 'America', 'military-industrial-aerospace', 'complex', 'unique', 'exploratory', 'time', 'aviation', 'history']",Toward The Unknown ed)

1435196,AOE0XMITAJWDT,B00508W3MU,Terry Sunday,"[43, 44]","""Toward the Unknown,"" released on October 20, 1956, and FINALLY available on DVD, is, in my opinion as a lifelong airplane buff and recently retired aerospace engineer, simply one of the very best aviation films ever made, bar none.A thrilling showcase of Cold-War-era jet and rocket aircraft and harrowing flight test operations, filmed on location at California's Edwards Air Force Base, it stars William Holden as Air Force Major Lincoln Bond and Lloyd Nolan as General William Banner. In the screenplay by Beirne Lay, Jr., Bond is an ex-fighter pilot who carries the stigma of having broken under the pressure of communist brainwashing while he was a POW after being shot down over Korea. The steps that he forces himself to take in order to prove to General Banner that he is fit enough to fly the supersonic rocket planes then being tested at Edwards is an interesting and absorbing tale, if a bit drawn-out dramatically.But the aircraft are the real stars of the show, and ""Toward the Unknown"" has them in abundance, with outstanding aerial photography of planes you will not see anywhere else in filmdom. For example, this is the only place to see actual footage of the Martin XB-51 bomber in flight (disguised with fake markings as the ""Gilbert XF-120""). You'll see North American F-100 ""Super Sabres,"" Lockheed F-94 ""Starfires"" and many other classic, historic jets that were really flying at the time. One of the most significant aircraft featured at length in ""Toward the Unknown"" is the Bell X-2 rocket plane. Carried aloft by a Boeing B-50 ""Superfortress,"" the X-2 investigated flight at speeds and altitudes far beyond those of the X-1, in which Captain Charles E. ""Chuck"" Yeager first exceeded the speed of sound on October 14, 1947. There's no CGI here--these airplanes are the real thing, and they are absolutely thrilling to watch!For about 25 years or so, I've had a videotape of ""Toward the Unknown"" that I recorded in Denver from broadcast television in Beta format (remember that?) and then transferred to a VHS tape after Beta disappeared. You can imagine the picture and sound quality. A few years ago, I bought a DVD of the show from an ""independent"" source. It's okay, but not spectacular.

1435197,AM1672DGAV2TY,B00508W3MU,Theo J.,"[0, 0]","It's odd that TOWARD THE UNKNOWN, actor William Holden's only film as a producer, took this long to reach DVD release. But this version is worth the wait---the film's spectacular aerial photography looks great, and the extensive location filming at Edwards AFB's Flight Test Center documents that remarkable time and place in aviation. (The story-line has a hefty component of 'Hollywood' about it, but we can't totally blame screenwriter Beirne Lay Jr. It went with the territory any time a major studio made this sort of thing.) Holden plays a former POW who seeks to redeem himself as a test pilot; Lloyd Nolan plays the hard-nosed commanding general who ultimately becomes a friend. Virginia Leith plays Holden's onetime girlfriend, now the general's secretary. But the actuality of what we see onscreen---test-flights of the Bell X-2, and superb footage featuring most of the Air Force's front-line aircraft---make the whole film work.
