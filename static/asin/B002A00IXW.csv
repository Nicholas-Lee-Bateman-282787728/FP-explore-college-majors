Warning!! This movie is not for everyone. I was not expecting much when I rented this on Netflix, but I was pleasantly or unpleasantly surprized. This movie was not made on a big budget, hence the reason I wanted to watch it in the first place. The acting is really good and sometimes believing (some actors in this flick are just horrible).

1257864,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B002A00IXW,Eric Sanberg,"[5, 8]","This movie looked interesting in that it was an independent production and the storyline looked decent enough. I checked it out  and I was wrong. Pretty far wrong at that.The lead character, Izzy, has gone off the deep end. It seems she got this way when she learned of her brother's death in Iraq. (at least this is about all we're given as evidence). She is so screwed up she waaaayyyy overreacts to things. I won't recount the plot as others have already done so. We know that people snap. We read it in the news on a regular basis, but I simply didn't believe it here. Maybe it's because the horrible acts she performs are prolonged. In some cases they take days and she is able to hide the fact from the people around her and still maintain a logic (a clever logic at that) to justify what she does. She even waxes philosophic during one scene. These atrocities then go well beyond the realm of ""crimes of passion.""As for the nuts and bolts of the movie: There are some real problems there as well. Yes it is low budget but that sort of thing only bothers me when it is accompanied by lousy acting and directing as is the case here. It also fails at the script/dialogue level. Whenever there was prolonged dialogue going on I got the impression I was listening to the writer and not the characters. Maybe it was due to the writing, but maybe it was due to the actors doing a poor job delivering their lines.All that being said you would do better by seeing a movie like ""The Girl Next Door"" which deals in the same madness but gives the viewer far greater believability.",2,What a Stink Bomb,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,1575,"['movie', 'looked', 'interesting', 'was', 'independent', 'production', 'storyline', 'looked', 'decent', 'enough', 'checked', 'was', 'wrong', 'Pretty', 'far', 'wrong', 'that.The', 'lead', 'character', 'Izzy', 'gone', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'got', 'way', 'when', 'learned', 'brother', 'death', 'Iraq', 'least', ""'re"", 'given', 'evidence', 'so', 'screwed', 'up', 'overreacts', 'things', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recount', 'plot', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'know', 'people', 'snap', 'read', 'news', 'regular', 'basis', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'here', 'Maybe', 'horrible', 'acts', 'performs', 'are', 'prolonged', 'cases', 'take', 'days', 'able', 'hide', 'fact', 'people', 'still', 'maintain', 'logic', 'clever', 'logic', 'justify', 'what', 'even', 'waxes', 'philosophic', 'one', 'scene', 'atrocities', 'then', 'go', 'well', 'realm', 'crimes', 'passion', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'movie', 'are', 'real', 'problems', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'Yes', 'low', 'budget', 'sort', 'thing', 'only', 'bothers', 'when', 'accompanied', 'lousy', 'acting', 'directing', 'as', 'case', 'here', 'also', 'script/dialogue', 'level', 'Whenever', 'was', 'prolonged', 'dialogue', 'going', 'got', 'impression', 'was', 'listening', 'writer', 'not', 'characters', 'Maybe', 'was', 'due', 'writing', 'maybe', 'was', 'due', 'actors', 'doing', 'poor', 'job', 'delivering', 'lines.All', 'being', 'said', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'same', 'madness', 'viewer', 'far', 'greater', 'believability']",Sick Girl

1257870,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,B002A00IXW,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[2, 5]","There is a new subtype of film that has emerged within the last half decade or so that exists almost solely within the horror movie genre. These films are based around one, or both of the the two main stays of the exploitation diet, sex and violence. Some examples of this new subtype include Gutterballs, The Hood Has Eyes, Defenceless, Baise Moi, and Blood and Sex Nightmare. Possibly an off shoot of the slightly less recent Torture Porn horror subgenre, this new subtype takes things one step further, and dares to do that which the big studios are afraid to do. Though I do respect the overall gist of their approach, and have absolutely no problem with extreme offensive underground cinema that dares to flip the bird at the Hollywood system, and doesn't mind going straight to DVD, the problem is that the majority of these films are technically not any good. They all suffer in one way or another from bad lighting, inconsistant audio, poor visual quality, horrible acting, shabby directing, and terrible scripts. Sure, most of them contain all the sex and adult oriented debauchery that anyone could ever want within an exploitative sleaze fest, yet, usually there is zero subtlety and nuance to make all this depravity anyway seductive or emotionally compelling. One can argue that subtlety should not be sought after in such low brow mindless entertainment, but I feel that without a decent understanding or use of these subtext, that any film, no matter what the subject matter may be, ultimately becomes boring. All the naked bodies and splatter by themselves does not make up for a film that doesn't know how to use them properly.Silence is Golden.What seperates Sick Girl from its contemporaries is that it actually tries to have real characters and deeper meaning by attempting some sibilance of a drama. This means one of two things. First and foremost, the level of gratuitous sex, and scantly clad women, is greatly reduced when compaired to other films in its subgenre. The only sexual scene that does take place is near the end of the picture, and is only there for shock value purposes. It involves Sick Girl cutting the genitals off of one of her captured male victims and making a strap on out of it by attatching it to what appears to be a railroad spike stuck through a piece of wood. She then proceeds to rape one of her tied up captured female victims with this crude home made device. More quirky then horrific in its exicution, the graphic scene is set up like a kind of clumsy music video with a shrilly recorded annoying buble gum pop song as its main soundtrack. Outside of this, most of the film consists of dialogue, lots and lots of dialogue, and sadly, most of it is painfully embarrassing to sit through. The plot, if you want to call it such, is really just a facade to bolster and explain Sick Girls super tough image and awesome killing abilities, while at the same time working as a superficial excuse for further scenes of graphic blood shed. Sick Girl is really just another film about one of those walking human death machines, you know the type that are mostly nomadic in their romantically self induced isolation? Sick Girl is a kind of modern Spaghetti Western- Shaw Brothers action hero, who is so otherworldly skilled and tough, that she might as well be of supernatural origin. This is by no means an original premise for a film, and it has been one that has worked to great effect many times in the past. The problem here is that everyone involved in this film is too amateurish to pull off this idea effectively. There are many one sided conversations throughout Sick Girl, in which she explains her views to one of her many subdued and gagged victims, but these moments go over like a ton of bricks. That is because they where designed to be powerfully moving important speeches, but are instead delivered with inept wooden acting, and self consciously stilted dialogue. It is almost as if writer and director Eban McGarr didn't receive his own memo explaining what kind of movie Sick Girl was suppose to be. If all these attempts proved one thing, it is that this really is a film made by laymen.Death on Two Legs.If there is a saving grace to this film, it was likely accidental rather then conceptual. Usually a film like Sick Girl would use that old time tested revenge outline, in which the victim of a horrible crime rights the injustices done to them by going on a killing spree. What makes Sick Girl so different, is that she is not a victim of anything more then mere annoyances. The people she tortures and kills, are not really harming anyone in any serious way, they are just being jerks. It is here that Sick Girl managed to inadvertantly tap into something that could of really made for an outstanding cinema experience. Lets face it, people can really be lame. We have all had those moments in which we where so perturbed, that we secretly wish that the object of or anger would spontaneously combust or get struck by a falling safe or lightning bolt. Each of us also share that same retained mixture of rage and regret from the many bad experiences in our pasts with either bullies or authority figures. Though I don't think that Eban McGarr really hit on the potential of this idea, or even really realized what he was getting into, Sick Girl almost works as a sort of guilty pleasure in which the people that most upset us in our daily lives, get dealt the ultimate karmic justice. Despite all the hope I had when I bought this film, or how badly I wanted to like it, I just couldn't muster anything within myself to make up for Sick Girls many tedious pit falls. The worst of which being a script full of incredably horrible dialogue. It was a nice try, I give him that, but the best I can do is give all those involved in this project an E for effort, not my recommendations.",2,An E for effort.,1257897600,"11 11,

1257872,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002A00IXW,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Sick Girl (Eben McGarr, 2007)I actually grabbed this sight unseen looking for the Masters of Horror episode directed by Lucky McKee, so what I actually got was something of a surprise. A pleasant one, but a surprise nonetheless. Not a bad little film at all, though rumors of its extremity have, in my estimation, been somewhat exaggerated. That's made up for by a compelling, if at times confusing, story and some solid characters.Plot: Izzy (Actors' Leslie Andrews), the title character, is a lovely young thing who went nuts when her older brother went off to join the military. Her younger brother is getting bullied at school, so Izzy (after an opening scene that, as far as I could tell, connects to nothing else and is just there for the shock value) kidnaps the three bullies and forces them to turn against one another. The top dog ends up shackled in Izzy's barn along with a poor, innocent couple who honestly don't deserve what's coming to them. Really. It's not nice.If you're looking for flat-out extremity, there are a few movies that should be in the queue before this, but not all that many. Still, while it holds up relatively well against both genre classics like The Devil's Experiment and new flicks like Philosophy of a Knife alike, it never really pushes any more gory envelopes than filmmakers like Brian Paulin (Fetus) or Ron DeCaro (The Gateway Meat) are pushing; if you've seen those and had no problems holding onto your dinner, this one probably won't bug you much, either. The difference is that most gore films that go for extremity are low-budget, badly-acted messes with little attention paid to the characters. Sick Girl resembles the genre's more nuanced movies (Deadgirl being an obvious example) in that McGarr, while writing the screenplay, obviously thought about Izzy far more than most gore filmmakers think about their main characters, and had enough talent to transfer a lot of what he was thinking to the page without making it overly obvious that that's what he was doing. Izzy, then, becomes a well-rounded and intriguing character for this sort of film. There are some times when Andrews' acting isn't quite up to the task--she's much better at running around chopping folks up than she is at emoting--but she's good enough for most of the movie to pull this off. Many of the minor characters are neither as well-acted nor as fleshed out (the main bully being the exception), so this becomes a movie driven solely by Izzy's character and the gore. It almost works. Any number of things could have been done to push it that last bit over the edge, but none of them actually happened; that is often the case with basement-budget features, and you really can't blame anyone for lack of cashflow. Eben McGarr did the best he could with what he had, and while it is very much a vertical-market film for the gorehounds in the audience, it does what it does well enough to get a recommendation from yours truly. ***",3,"Some good points, but average overall.",1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,2955,"['Sick', 'Girl', 'Eben', 'McGarr', '2007', 'actually', 'grabbed', 'sight', 'unseen', 'looking', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'episode', 'directed', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'what', 'actually', 'got', 'was', 'something', 'surprise', 'pleasant', 'one', 'surprise', 'nonetheless', 'Not', 'bad', 'little', 'film', 'rumors', 'extremity', 'have', 'estimation', 'been', 'somewhat', 'exaggerated', 'made', 'up', 'compelling', 'times', 'confusing', 'story', 'solid', 'characters.Plot', 'Izzy', 'Actors', 'Leslie', 'Andrews', 'title', 'character', 'lovely', 'young', 'thing', 'who', 'went', 'nuts', 'when', 'older', 'brother', 'went', 'join', 'military', 'younger', 'brother', 'getting', 'bullied', 'school', 'so', 'Izzy', 'opening', 'scene', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'connects', 'nothing', 'else', 'just', 'shock', 'value', 'three', 'bullies', 'forces', 'turn', 'one', 'top', 'dog', 'up', 'shackled', 'Izzy', 'barn', 'poor', 'innocent', 'couple', 'who', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'what', 'coming', 'Really', 'not', 'nice.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'flat-out', 'extremity', 'are', 'few', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'queue', 'not', 'many', 'Still', 'up', 'relatively', 'well', 'genre', 'classics', 'Devil', 'Experiment', 'new', 'flicks', 'Philosophy', 'Knife', 'alike', 'never', 'really', 'more', 'gory', 'envelopes', 'filmmakers', 'Brian', 'Paulin', 'Fetus', 'Ron', 'DeCaro', 'Gateway', 'Meat', 'are', 'pushing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'had', 'problems', 'holding', 'dinner', 'one', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bug', 'much', 'either', 'difference', 'most', 'gore', 'films', 'go', 'extremity', 'are', 'low-budget', 'badly-acted', 'messes', 'little', 'attention', 'paid', 'characters', 'Sick', 'Girl', 'genre', 'more', 'nuanced', 'movies', 'Deadgirl', 'being', 'obvious', 'example', 'McGarr', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'obviously', 'thought', 'Izzy', 'far', 'more', 'most', 'gore', 'filmmakers', 'think', 'main', 'characters', 'had', 'enough', 'talent', 'transfer', 'lot', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'page', 'making', 'overly', 'obvious', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'Izzy', 'then', 'well-rounded', 'intriguing', 'character', 'sort', 'film', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Andrews', 'acting', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'task', 'much', 'better', 'running', 'around', 'chopping', 'folks', 'up', 'emoting', 'good', 'enough', 'most', 'movie', 'pull', 'off', 'Many', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'neither', 'well-acted', 'fleshed', 'main', 'bully', 'being', 'exception', 'so', 'movie', 'driven', 'solely', 'Izzy', 'character', 'gore', 'almost', 'number', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'push', 'last', 'bit', 'edge', 'none', 'actually', 'happened', 'often', 'case', 'basement-budget', 'features', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'anyone', 'lack', 'cashflow', 'Eben', 'McGarr', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'what', 'had', 'very', 'much', 'vertical-market', 'film', 'gorehounds', 'audience', 'what', 'well', 'enough', 'get', 'recommendation', 'yours', 'truly', '***']",Sick Girl
