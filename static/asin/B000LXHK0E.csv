1041717,A1UOTG037037XY,B000LXHK0E,Cleo,"[1, 1]",This is an excellent set of interviews from real Chinese across China with interesting faces and sometimes moments of sheer comedy contrasting with the narrator's British accent e.g.  Three ladies from Dongbei who look like ethnic Coreans hilariously discuss their encounters with the angelic Tibetans who enter their shop in Lhasa.  The Uighurs get an up close profile with an emphasis on the women.  I recommend this set without reservation to everyone not just Chinese.,5,Very Dishy,1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,472,"['excellent', 'set', 'interviews', 'real', 'Chinese', 'China', 'interesting', 'moments', 'sheer', 'comedy', 'contrasting', 'narrator', 'British', 'accent', 'e.g', 'Three', 'ladies', 'Dongbei', 'who', 'look', 'ethnic', 'Coreans', 'hilariously', 'discuss', 'encounters', 'angelic', 'Tibetans', 'who', 'enter', 'shop', 'Lhasa', 'Uighurs', 'get', 'up', 'close', 'emphasis', 'women', 'recommend', 'set', 'reservation', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'Chinese']",N/A

This is an excellent program about China. It showed a side of China that I did not know about. Now I understand why we have such a surplus with China : some of their government officials ( those not corrupt ) seems to really care about improving their economy, while most of our folks care about getting re-elected or having big-business support ( and continue to ship our jobs offshore ).It also educated me on the price the Chinese are paying for our need to consume. My son has probably 80 small toy cars ( $0.94 versions ) - while he would have been content with 20 or 30 ( they are all broken anyway due to poor quality ! ). But it is our greed which is partly our own downfall, and both our societies are paying a hefty price for it. I did not realize how much, until I watched this program.The social tensions in China are scarey. I am sure it keeps some of Chinese up all night. This program is worth the 4-hour investment. You may stay up all night watching it too !",5,Excellent and insightful,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,1064,"['saw', 'broadcast', 'Jan.', '15', 'was', 'glued', 'TV', 'even', 'was', '12', 'midnight', 'excellent', 'program', 'China', 'showed', 'side', 'China', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Now', 'understand', 'why', 'have', 'such', 'surplus', 'China', 'government', 'officials', 'not', 'corrupt', 'really', 'care', 'improving', 'economy', 'most', 'folks', 'care', 'getting', 're-elected', 'having', 'big-business', 'support', 'continue', 'ship', 'jobs', 'offshore', '.It', 'also', 'educated', 'price', 'Chinese', 'are', 'paying', 'need', 'consume', 'My', 'son', 'probably', '80', 'small', 'toy', 'cars', '0.94', 'versions', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'content', '20', '30', 'are', 'broken', 'anyway', 'due', 'poor', 'quality', 'greed', 'partly', 'own', 'downfall', 'societies', 'are', 'paying', 'hefty', 'price', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'watched', 'program.The', 'social', 'tensions', 'China', 'are', 'scarey', 'am', 'sure', 'Chinese', 'night', 'program', '4-hour', 'investment', 'may', 'stay', 'up', 'night', 'watching', 'too']",N/A

The overall feeling was that China will have to deal with a lot of consequences of its economic reforms that will be very damaging to their culture, people and enviornment.  It is amazing that this country is still running...how long the Communist will last?  It seems power, corruption and money is what's holding this country up.  Sad to see that the majority rural people are suffering the most to appease the smaller percentage of city dwellers.

1041720,ADOZJJSJ9R5XI,B000LXHK0E,Kim Boykin,"[52, 52]","In four episodes of about 55 minutes each, this PBS documentary examines some of the major challenges facing contemporary Chinese society.Episode 1, ""Power and the People,"" focuses on the Communist Party's rule of China. Topics include government opposition to separatism in the heavily Muslim province of Xinjiang; the Party's efforts to create a prosperous society; the governance of Tibet; the National People's Congress, which puts the Party's decisions into action; the election of a village committee; and corruption in the Party.Episode 2, ""Women of the Country,"" focuses on the difficulties faced by Chinese women, especially in rural areas (where two-thirds of China's population lives). The episode examines birth planning, marriage, women who live in the country while their husbands work in the city, women in Tibet, the hopelessness of many young women in China, the Muslim women of Xinjiang, and the opportunities and hardships for women in cities.Episode 3, ""Shifting Nature,"" focuses on pollution brought on by rapid industrialization and on massive water diversion projects that involve resettling the populations of entire towns.Episode 4, ""Freedom and Justice,"" examines the limits on religious freedom and freedom of the press, AIDS deaths that the government could have prevented, the displacement of poor people by land ""development,"" and injustices in the justice system.This is an interesting, informative, and thought-provoking documentary.(If you want to learn about the history of China in the twentieth century, I'd highly recommend the documentary ""China: A Century of Revolution."")",4,China's challenges,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,1611,"['four', 'episodes', '55', 'minutes', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'major', 'challenges', 'facing', 'contemporary', 'Chinese', 'society.Episode', '1', 'Power', 'People', 'Communist', 'Party', 'rule', 'China', 'Topics', 'include', 'government', 'opposition', 'separatism', 'heavily', 'Muslim', 'province', 'Xinjiang', 'Party', 'efforts', 'create', 'prosperous', 'society', 'governance', 'Tibet', 'National', 'People', 'Congress', 'Party', 'decisions', 'action', 'election', 'village', 'committee', 'corruption', 'Party.Episode', '2', 'Women', 'Country', 'difficulties', 'faced', 'Chinese', 'women', 'especially', 'rural', 'areas', 'where', 'two-thirds', 'China', 'population', 'episode', 'birth', 'planning', 'marriage', 'women', 'who', 'live', 'country', 'husbands', 'work', 'city', 'women', 'Tibet', 'hopelessness', 'many', 'young', 'women', 'China', 'Muslim', 'women', 'Xinjiang', 'opportunities', 'hardships', 'women', 'cities.Episode', '3', 'Shifting', 'Nature', 'pollution', 'brought', 'rapid', 'industrialization', 'massive', 'water', 'diversion', 'projects', 'involve', 'resettling', 'populations', 'entire', 'towns.Episode', '4', 'Freedom', 'Justice', 'limits', 'religious', 'freedom', 'freedom', 'press', 'AIDS', 'deaths', 'government', 'could', 'have', 'prevented', 'displacement', 'poor', 'people', 'land', 'development', 'injustices', 'justice', 'system.This', 'interesting', 'informative', 'thought-provoking', 'documentary', 'want', 'learn', 'history', 'China', 'twentieth', 'century', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'China', 'Century', 'Revolution']",N/A
1041721,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B000LXHK0E,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[4, 4]","""China From the Inside"" consists of four programs and provides a good overview of what life is like in China. The first segment (Power and the People) tells us that China is an atheist state that tolerates religion - up to the point where religion begins to threaten the authority of the state. This includes Islam in the Northwest Territory, Christianity in central China, and Buddhism in Tibet. Falun Gong is also eyed warily because of its ability to turn out impressive numbers of people.There are 60 million Communist Party members (about one in 22), in all areas of the country. The National People's Congress (3,000) 'approves' higher-level decisions and operationalizes them. In the one local election shown, 94% of the populace turned out. Bribery for votes is sometimes a problem, and sometimes the results are overturned. Corruption is a major problem.'Women of the Country' is the second segment. The Party has banned discrimination since 1949, and the problem has improved. (Formerly their feet were bound to keep them homebound.) Women are now able to choose a husband and get an education. Two-thirds of the rural workers are women - many men work in the city. Still, however, girls are often aborted (illegal) or abandoned. A family with a female first child is allowed another. Dowries are paid to the bride's parents. Tibet (population 2.5 million) has no birth limitations. Chinese women have one of the highest suicide rates (rat poison).  A Chinese woman's life is still more difficult in Muslim areas.'Shifting Nature' covers the environment, and probably is a bit dated vs. latest initiatives. Regardless, cancer rates have soared in some areas, and most of the world's most polluted large cities are in China. Local officials support polluters because they're heavy taxpayers. Factory officials are tipped off prior to inspections. Lack of water is another problem - spending $56 billion on a 900 mile canal system to supply Beijing and other areas from southern China. Citizens forced to relocate because of eg. water projects are compensated, but they worry about finding a new source of income.'Freedom and Justice' addresses the Chinese legal system. Tibet's Dalai Lama has been absent from Tibet for 50-some years, and it is illegal to post his photo - fear of an independence movement. Approved demonstrations (eg. supporting Party direction) are covered by the media. (Media-dispensed propaganda seems pervasive.)Almost half (49%) of all judges are not college graduates. The judicial system is run by the Party, and major cases are often decided by it in advance. Citizens believing they've been wronged can also petition the Beijing government. The DVD states that the government admits about 80% of their complaints are legitimate, but less than 1% receive satisfaction. Many of the rest are sent to labor camps.",5,Good Overview -,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,2846,"['China', 'Inside', 'four', 'programs', 'good', 'overview', 'what', 'life', 'China', 'first', 'segment', 'Power', 'People', 'China', 'atheist', 'state', 'religion', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'religion', 'threaten', 'authority', 'state', 'Islam', 'Northwest', 'Territory', 'Christianity', 'central', 'China', 'Buddhism', 'Tibet', 'Falun', 'Gong', 'also', 'eyed', 'warily', 'ability', 'turn', 'out', 'impressive', 'numbers', 'are', '60', 'million', 'Communist', 'Party', 'members', 'one', '22', 'areas', 'country', 'National', 'People', 'Congress', '3,000', ""'approves"", 'higher-level', 'decisions', 'one', 'local', 'election', 'shown', '94', '%', 'populace', 'turned', 'out', 'Bribery', 'votes', 'sometimes', 'problem', 'sometimes', 'results', 'are', 'overturned', 'Corruption', 'major', 'problem', ""'Women"", 'Country', 'second', 'segment', 'Party', 'banned', 'discrimination', '1949', 'problem', 'improved', 'Formerly', 'feet', 'were', 'bound', 'keep', 'Women', 'are', 'now', 'able', 'choose', 'husband', 'get', 'education', 'Two-thirds', 'rural', 'workers', 'are', 'women', 'many', 'men', 'work', 'city', 'Still', 'however', 'girls', 'are', 'often', 'aborted', 'illegal', 'abandoned', 'family', 'female', 'first', 'child', 'allowed', 'Dowries', 'are', 'paid', 'bride', 'parents', 'Tibet', 'population', '2.5', 'million', 'birth', 'limitations', 'Chinese', 'women', 'have', 'one', 'highest', 'suicide', 'rates', 'rat', 'poison', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'life', 'still', 'more', 'difficult', 'Muslim', 'areas', ""'Shifting"", 'Nature', 'covers', 'environment', 'probably', 'bit', 'dated', 'vs.', 'latest', 'initiatives', 'Regardless', 'cancer', 'rates', 'have', 'soared', 'areas', 'most', 'world', 'most', 'polluted', 'large', 'cities', 'are', 'China', 'Local', 'officials', 'support', 'polluters', ""'re"", 'heavy', 'taxpayers', 'Factory', 'officials', 'are', 'tipped', 'off', 'prior', 'inspections', 'Lack', 'water', 'problem', 'spending', '56', 'billion', '900', 'mile', 'canal', 'system', 'supply', 'Beijing', 'other', 'areas', 'southern', 'China', 'Citizens', 'forced', 'relocate', 'eg', 'water', 'projects', 'are', 'compensated', 'worry', 'finding', 'new', 'source', 'income', ""'Freedom"", 'Justice', 'Chinese', 'legal', 'system', 'Tibet', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'been', 'absent', 'Tibet', '50-some', 'years', 'illegal', 'post', 'photo', 'fear', 'independence', 'movement', 'Approved', 'demonstrations', 'eg', 'supporting', 'Party', 'direction', 'are', 'covered', 'media', 'Media-dispensed', 'propaganda', 'pervasive', 'Almost', 'half', '49', '%', 'judges', 'are', 'not', 'college', 'graduates', 'judicial', 'system', 'run', 'Party', 'major', 'cases', 'are', 'often', 'decided', 'advance', 'Citizens', 'believing', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wronged', 'can', 'also', 'petition', 'Beijing', 'government', 'DVD', 'states', 'government', '80', '%', 'complaints', 'are', 'legitimate', 'less', '1', '%', 'receive', 'satisfaction', 'Many', 'rest', 'are', 'sent', 'labor', 'camps']",N/A
