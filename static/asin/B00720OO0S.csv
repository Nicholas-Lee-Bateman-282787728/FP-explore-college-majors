Most importantly I am also a student of the Bible and have a special interest in end time's studies from the Bible's perspective. Based on my observations of world events and the Biblical accounts of the world situation in the end times I am convinced we are living in those times.This is clearly a Christian film and will repel those who reject the Christian message; it is interesting to note the vitriolic nature of some of the reviews that have been written elsewhere about this movie. It is evident that the verbal antagonism being expressed goes far beyond the movie directly to the concepts of God, man, the end of the world and judgment.Only the Lord knows how much time we have left but I, for one, think the closing event in the movie is right upon us. There are really no surprises in the movie as it deals with things that have been discussed extensively over a long period of time. What the movie does, however, is to put the viewer in the middle of the action as the closing events of human history begin to unfold. The author of the book by the same name, John Hagee, is very knowledgeable on the subject and gets the facts laid out in a manner consistent with the Biblical account.I believe there is some artistic license in the closing scene but not so much as to compromise the message intended.

Many of the offerings of the past have been laughably poor in quality in all phases of movie making. This one featured great camera work, competent acting, and a decent story line. If you're a fan of bang-bang, shoot-em-up suspense thrillers, this will appeal to you. I'm more attracted to cerebral and spiritual films, but this one definitely kept my interest. David A.R. White was stellar. His romantic interest in the film was cute enough to satisfy most critics who require a lovely heroine to make their movie experience complete. I only gave this 4 stars because 5 stars represents a movie that you should not miss. I think most people will find this movie enjoyable, but it certainly does not bring a message that hasn't been told before. I like the direction Christian films are going.
