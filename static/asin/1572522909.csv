I always felt there were more stories relating to the German Atrocities, other than from a Jewish stand point. The Third Reich was purely evil, if you did not fit that (Aryan mold) you were destined for tragedy. Everyone has a story to be told,it has not come to light yet.A russian commander thought he was saving two children from China's revolution bringing them to the Ivanov Internaional School of former Soviet Union during 1940-1945. From the time Chuchu and Luo Xiaoman first arrived at the school like other kids full of mischeivous adventures. In the summer of 1941 Chuchu and other classmates(not Luo)went to Belarussia summer camp their lives changed forever. The blatant execution of a school teacher, one classmate sacrificed his life for others to escape,Chu chu was a maid for a demented german doctor. He had the nasty habit of using human bodies for his tattoo work, one way of living forever on skin. He would then have lavish parties to show off his work.

There is no real plot - they do not overcome anything by their efforts, solve any mystery, etc. There is no happy ending as they ride off into the sunset.Still, this is a captivating movie showing both the cruelty of some men and the inner drive for survival of the victims.  When it ends, you will not feel like it has been two hours since the movie began.  Nobody would feel like they wasted their time watching this movie.For those sensitive to such things, there are a few scenes that contain children, both boys and girls (but not together), totally naked.  It is NOT, in any way, erotic, however.  But it does give a sense of other culture's relaxed attitudes toward nakedness in contrast to typical American attitudes.If you are trying to decide if you should buy the DVD, I wholeheartedly say, get it.

186985,A2Z8SIZVKESSJC,1572522909,Chapulina R,"[27, 30]","This impressive film begins in the early summer of 1941, at the Ivanov International School in Moscow.  Luo Xiaoman and Chuchu are two new students who have come to Russia after the brutal revolution in China killed their parents.  As kanikuli (summer break) arrives, Chuchu accompanies her class to children's camp in Byelorussia.  Xiaoman remains in Moscow.  Then, Russia is invaded with the devastating fury of Hitler's ""Operation Barbarossa"".  The western borders of the USSR are struck especially hard.  By the end of the onslaught, only 25% of Byelorussia will be left intact.  And Chuchu's camp is directly in Hitler's path.  Back at the Ivanov School, the faculty and older students, Xiaoman included, rush to enlist in the army.  But the Chinese boy is deemed too young for the front.  ""Red Cherry"" is an uncompromising, horrifying story about two children's parallel experience of the war.  Chuchu sees her teacher, Miss Vera, and classmates murdered before her eyes.  She is spared by the Nazi commander, General von Dietrich, who admires her ""perfect golden skin"".  He takes Chuchu with him, but he has a hideous fate in mind for the little girl.  Meanwhile, Xiaoman becomes a bicycle messenger.  His unhappy duty is to deliver notices of casualties from the front.  One recipient of tragic news is an elderly blind woman who asks Xiaoman to read the letter aloud.  He feels such pity for her that he makes up a congratulatory message about her son's heroic service and promotion.  From then on, Xiaoman and the orphaned girl Nadya, whom he ""adopts"", regularly deliver revised notices from the front.  But the front is swiftly advancing eastward, toward Moscow.  General von Dietrich reveals that he is sick and dying.  An amateur tattooist, he hopes to live on through his art.  Chuchu's perfect skin will become the living canvas for the Nazi's undying fervor for his Fuhrer.  Battle comes to Moscow, and Xiaoman will get his chance to fight for Russia.  But his innocent imagination could not have predicted the outcome.  Although heartbreaking, ""Red Cherry"" is haunting, beautiful, and recommended.  Moreso, because the story is true.  The two child actors are wonderful.

186987,A3R906AZJ9VANS,1572522909,John Black,"[0, 0]","In the winter of 1940 a twelve-year-old boy named Luo and a thirteen-year-old girl named Chuchu, both from China, and taken to the Ivanov International School in Moscow. The principal does not want them (it is two months into the school year) and the children do not speak Russian, but they are left there anyway. There is, however, at least one other child in the school from China and the two new students soon begin to adjust to their new environment. This is a war tragedy due to the circumstances which brought the children to the school even before the war directly affects the school. Early in the movie Chuchu describes in detail how her father was executed. The actress did a wonderful job portraying the emotions in this scene as did the actors portraying the students and teachers listening.In the Autumn of 1941 the school is evacuated due to the war and by this time several students are already in German hands, including Chuchu. Many of the boys, including Lou and some very young boys, want to stay and fight instead of leaving with the principle. Even one girl is caught dressed as a soldier trying to get onto a troop truck. From here the actions in the movie descend into violence and terror, including mass killing of unarmed men women and children.The movie continues to follow the plight of Chuchu and Lou. What I have described so far are early developments setting up the main portion of the movie. I don't want to give too much away from this point on, so as not to spoil the movie for anyone, but a few things I want to vaguely reference as points of interest are: Luo's strange way of handling a job of delivering death notices to the families of dead soldiers; Luo's interesting way of fighting the Germans; and finally, the tattoo shown on the DVD cover has an important part to play in the plight of Chuchu.I loved the movie. The plot was strong and well defined, the acting in the movie is excellent, and the characters are well developed. And even though the movie is about war, and includes a great deal of killing, it walks a fine line of not totally skipping it, yet not getting too vivid.One final thing on a lighter note I will bring up before closing. Before the terror of war really sets in there is one really funny scene (in contrast to the rest of the movie which is anything but funny). This might be a minor spoiler but only minor because you will really have go see it to appreciate how funny this scene is. The school has a bath house which is separate from the other buildings. It is a loosely constructed wooden structure with a center wall which does not go all the way to the ceiling, but high enough the children cannot see over it. The boys shower on one side of the wall and the girls on the other, each side has its own entrance. The children begin horsing around, throwing and spraying water over the wall at the other group. The boys especially are throwing pans of water over the wall. However, unknown to the boys, while they are refilling their pans the girls get dressed and leave very quickly. One of the women who works at the school (a large woman called to Aunt Tonya) enters the bath house as the girls are leaving. While Aunt Tonya is undressing the boys make one last effort to simultaneously throw several pans of water over the wall. They hit the wall and it falls, followed by the whole loosely constructed building. There are about a dozen boys and about a dozen girls seen nude in this sequence, Aunt Tonya is the only one involved in this who is not seen nude.",5,War Tragedy from a different perspective,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,3533,"['winter', '1940', 'twelve-year-old', 'boy', 'named', 'Luo', 'thirteen-year-old', 'girl', 'named', 'Chuchu', 'China', 'taken', 'Ivanov', 'International', 'School', 'Moscow', 'principal', 'not', 'want', 'two', 'months', 'school', 'year', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'Russian', 'are', 'left', 'anyway', 'however', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'child', 'school', 'China', 'two', 'new', 'students', 'soon', 'begin', 'adjust', 'new', 'environment', 'war', 'tragedy', 'due', 'circumstances', 'brought', 'children', 'school', 'even', 'war', 'directly', 'school', 'Early', 'movie', 'Chuchu', 'detail', 'how', 'father', 'was', 'executed', 'actress', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'emotions', 'scene', 'did', 'actors', 'portraying', 'students', 'teachers', 'listening.In', 'Autumn', '1941', 'school', 'evacuated', 'due', 'war', 'time', 'several', 'students', 'are', 'already', 'German', 'hands', 'including', 'Chuchu', 'Many', 'boys', 'including', 'Lou', 'very', 'young', 'boys', 'want', 'stay', 'fight', 'instead', 'leaving', 'principle', 'Even', 'one', 'girl', 'caught', 'dressed', 'soldier', 'trying', 'get', 'troop', 'truck', 'here', 'actions', 'movie', 'descend', 'violence', 'terror', 'including', 'mass', 'killing', 'unarmed', 'men', 'women', 'children.The', 'movie', 'follow', 'plight', 'Chuchu', 'Lou', 'What', 'have', 'described', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'early', 'developments', 'setting', 'up', 'main', 'portion', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'point', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'movie', 'anyone', 'few', 'things', 'want', 'vaguely', 'reference', 'points', 'interest', 'are', 'Luo', 'strange', 'way', 'handling', 'job', 'delivering', 'death', 'notices', 'families', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'Luo', 'interesting', 'way', 'fighting', 'Germans', 'finally', 'tattoo', 'shown', 'DVD', 'cover', 'important', 'part', 'play', 'plight', 'Chuchu.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'plot', 'was', 'strong', 'well', 'defined', 'acting', 'movie', 'excellent', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'even', 'movie', 'war', 'great', 'deal', 'killing', 'fine', 'line', 'not', 'totally', 'skipping', 'yet', 'not', 'getting', 'too', 'vivid.One', 'final', 'thing', 'lighter', 'note', 'will', 'bring', 'up', 'closing', 'terror', 'war', 'really', 'one', 'really', 'funny', 'scene', 'contrast', 'rest', 'movie', 'anything', 'funny', 'might', 'be', 'minor', 'spoiler', 'only', 'minor', 'will', 'really', 'have', 'go', 'see', 'appreciate', 'how', 'funny', 'scene', 'school', 'bath', 'house', 'separate', 'other', 'buildings', 'loosely', 'constructed', 'wooden', 'structure', 'center', 'wall', 'not', 'go', 'way', 'ceiling', 'high', 'enough', 'children', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'boys', 'shower', 'one', 'side', 'wall', 'girls', 'other', 'side', 'own', 'entrance', 'children', 'begin', 'horsing', 'around', 'throwing', 'spraying', 'water', 'wall', 'other', 'group', 'boys', 'especially', 'are', 'throwing', 'pans', 'water', 'wall', 'However', 'unknown', 'boys', 'are', 'refilling', 'pans', 'girls', 'get', 'dressed', 'leave', 'very', 'quickly', 'One', 'women', 'who', 'school', 'large', 'woman', 'called', 'Aunt', 'Tonya', 'bath', 'house', 'girls', 'are', 'leaving', 'Aunt', 'Tonya', 'undressing', 'boys', 'make', 'one', 'last', 'effort', 'simultaneously', 'throw', 'several', 'pans', 'water', 'wall', 'hit', 'wall', 'followed', 'whole', 'loosely', 'constructed', 'building', 'are', 'dozen', 'boys', 'dozen', 'girls', 'seen', 'nude', 'sequence', 'Aunt', 'Tonya', 'only', 'one', 'involved', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'nude']",N/A

The film crew had contacted her and obtained her consent when making the film.  But the most horrific and most unforgettable part was fictional (and there's the rub).

It opens in 1940 when a young Chinese boy and girl are sent to a Russian school.  There is a civil war going on in China and their parents have killed by the Nationalists.  They are welcomed by their Russian comrades and the first half hour of the film is about their idyllic existence with kind teachers and an atmosphere of acceptance and learning.  We see the youngsters enjoying childhood pranks and we smile at their antics.Then the world suddenly changes. The Nazis invade Russia.  And the children of the school become the victims of abject cruelty. Some of them are murdered, all of them are starving and there are moments of heroism as well as horror.  The two Chinese children suffer, as do the Russians.  The boy becomes a street urchin and eventually he performs some courageous acts against the enemy.  The girl works as a virtual slave in a monastery that has been taken over by the Nazis.  The commander sees himself as an artist and forces her to have an ugly tattoo glorifying the nazi regime on her back.  When the Nazis are defeated she suffers the emotional shame of this.This film has won many accolades including an Oscar nomination.  I add my own accolades.  It is beautifully photographed, well paced and horrifying to watch the innocence of the children despoiled.  I wanted to hug the children and save them all.  I felt their hunger and their shame and their will to survive.  I applauded the small acts of heroism.  And I wanted to reach out my arms and save these children.This film is not for everyone.
