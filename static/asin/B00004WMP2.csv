If you want to know what the episodes are like, read the other reviews.  I just wanted to mention that not only are these 2 episodes hilariously campily silly, the audio and video quality are SUPERB.  Considering this was a crappy '70s show that has probably been laying around in a vault for twenty years, Rhino gave it very nice treatment when transferring it to DVD.  Very clean images, which make the 70s decor even more disturbing that one could imagine.  Also included on the DVD is an interview with Mike Lookinland (Bobby) and Susan Olsen (Cindy), who talk about their days doing the BB and the BBVH.

556117,ALC3LG8YTNHU3,B00004WMP2,"Bruce Barker ""Risingsnow""","[23, 24]","When I ordered this, I did it for a number of reasons. First, my wife and I are big fans of 70s kitsch and the Brady shows are the epitome of it. We already own the 5 seasons of the original series, and were looking forward to a fresh dose of camp. We've both read Maureen McCormick's autobiography and it provided a lot of information regarding what was happening behind the scenes in the lives of the cast members.Well, on the one hand we were deeply satisfied because the show exceeds all expectations in terms of trashy glitz, over-the-top acting, and ""what where they THINKING?"" moments. The show made Ed Wood's body of work look positively brilliant by comparison. As others have said, it's deliciously bad. The bonus interview really doesn't provide a lot of new information, but it was interesting to learn exactly what mistakes were made post-Brady that derailed most of the careers of the participants. Susan Olsen in particular knowingly discusses the irony in the fact that the last pooch that played ""Tiger"" on the Brady Bunch went on to have a more successful career than any of the humans on the show.On the other hand...The show lasted less than a season and, depending on the source, ran either 9 or 10 episodes. This collection only consists of two episodes. There is no reason given as to what happened with the remaining episodes and apparently there is no plan to release them to the public. Even the most addicted fans of campy trash would likely be unable to handle more than a couple of episodes in a single sitting, but it was quite a letdown to know that this set would only be a teaser and we'd be unable to acquire the remainder of the series.Caveat Emptor - buyer beware. The two episodes provided are enough to sate your curiosity and interest in just how bad television can get, but we still wound up feeling we got less than half of what we wanted.The old cliche says that half a loaf is better than none at all, but nonetheless, we thought we were paying for all the episodes, and not just enough to leave us wanting.",3,Not enough and too much at the same time,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,2050,"['When', 'ordered', 'did', 'number', 'reasons', 'First', 'wife', 'are', 'big', 'fans', '70s', 'kitsch', 'Brady', 'shows', 'are', 'epitome', 'already', 'own', '5', 'seasons', 'original', 'series', 'were', 'looking', 'forward', 'fresh', 'dose', 'camp', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Maureen', 'McCormick', 'autobiography', 'provided', 'lot', 'information', 'regarding', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'scenes', 'lives', 'cast', 'members.Well', 'one', 'hand', 'were', 'deeply', 'satisfied', 'show', 'expectations', 'terms', 'trashy', 'glitz', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'what', 'where', 'THINKING', 'moments', 'show', 'made', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'body', 'work', 'look', 'positively', 'brilliant', 'comparison', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'deliciously', 'bad', 'bonus', 'interview', 'really', ""n't"", 'provide', 'lot', 'new', 'information', 'was', 'interesting', 'learn', 'exactly', 'what', 'mistakes', 'were', 'made', 'post-Brady', 'derailed', 'most', 'careers', 'participants', 'Susan', 'Olsen', 'particular', 'knowingly', 'irony', 'fact', 'last', 'pooch', 'played', 'Tiger', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'went', 'have', 'more', 'successful', 'career', 'humans', 'show.On', 'other', 'hand', 'show', 'lasted', 'less', 'season', 'depending', 'source', 'ran', 'either', '9', '10', 'episodes', 'collection', 'only', 'two', 'episodes', 'reason', 'given', 'what', 'happened', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'apparently', 'plan', 'release', 'public', 'Even', 'most', 'addicted', 'fans', 'campy', 'trash', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'unable', 'handle', 'more', 'couple', 'episodes', 'single', 'sitting', 'was', 'quite', 'letdown', 'know', 'set', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'teaser', ""'d"", 'be', 'unable', 'acquire', 'remainder', 'series.Caveat', 'Emptor', 'buyer', 'beware', 'two', 'episodes', 'provided', 'are', 'enough', 'sate', 'curiosity', 'interest', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'television', 'can', 'get', 'still', 'wound', 'up', 'feeling', 'got', 'less', 'half', 'what', 'wanted.The', 'old', 'cliche', 'loaf', 'better', 'none', 'nonetheless', 'thought', 'were', 'paying', 'episodes', 'not', 'just', 'enough', 'leave', 'wanting']",The Brady Bunch Variety Hour

The DVD is divided into three parts:  The interview with ""Bobby"" and ""Cindy"", which is fairly interesting (they talk about their remembrances of the variety show, even though Mike Lookinland seems to have blocked much of it out).  The other two parts are the first and second BBVH installments.  Guest stars include Tony Randall (what was HE thinking????), Vincent Price, Rip Taylor, H.R. Puffnstuff, and Donnie & Marie.The first episode has a truly surreal ""number"" featuring a bunch of clowns jumping around in a swimming pool (some of the clowns being Bradys).  Very strange and incoherent!  This whole Variety Hour concept seems like something Ed Wood had a hand in!

What kid who grew up during the Seventies wouldn't? But the Variety Hour is something entirely different. Instead of being cute and campy, it's dumb and and disturbing.The fake Rockettes (Krofftettes?!) are one thing, but WTF with the swimming pool? Laugh tracks rarely ring true but why does this even pretend to have a studio audience? All very painful. Even worse and particularly nauseating are the goo-goo eyes the Brady boys make at their sisters during the roller skating number. (Greg lusting after his mom is nothing new, LOL)This DVD doesn't even include all the Variety Hour episodes. Perhaps that's a blessing! Apparently there were nine episodes during the 1976-77 season. I would bet just two will be more than enough for you.Unless being high improves the viewing experience, the interview with Susan Olsen and Mike Lookinland is the only thing worth watching.

556121,A596GBZ637JH4,B00004WMP2,"Jennifer N. ""Jennifer""","[2, 3]","The only episode of the Brady Bunch Variety Hour that I had ever seen, up until now, was the pilot episode, which I had seen several times. While I had heard how ""bad"" it was, and even mentioned as a nightmare, I thought it was hilarious. It was pretty far out there, even for the Bradys. However, I love it, mainly for that reason. The way that they all continue their Brady parts is wonderful, and the comedy they brought with it. However, I only gave this three stars, not because I didn't like it, but because I really hope all of the episodes are released on DVD. After all, if they're going to go through the trouble to release two, why not release all nine? One can only hope.When watching these episodes, and hear them introduce themselves to you as the Brady Bunch, it's hard to think of them as anything other than the Brady Bunch and makes you really think that they are a real family.Which makes me go back to that question we all ask ourselves. ""Why do we love the Bradys so much?"" And the answer is simple. Though they were one of the most unrealistic shows that there is, it's something that gives us all hope. When life is bad, we can escape to ""Bradyville"" where everything is always well.Growing watching the Brady Bunch, who, at least once, didn't wish their last name was Brady?",3,And They're Back!,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,1298,"['only', 'episode', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Variety', 'Hour', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'up', 'now', 'was', 'pilot', 'episode', 'had', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'had', 'heard', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'even', 'mentioned', 'nightmare', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'was', 'pretty', 'far', 'there', 'even', 'Bradys', 'However', 'love', 'mainly', 'reason', 'way', 'continue', 'Brady', 'parts', 'wonderful', 'comedy', 'brought', 'However', 'only', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'hope', 'episodes', 'are', 'released', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'going', 'go', 'trouble', 'release', 'two', 'why', 'not', 'release', 'nine', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope.When', 'watching', 'episodes', 'hear', 'introduce', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'hard', 'think', 'anything', 'other', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'really', 'think', 'are', 'real', 'family.Which', 'go', 'back', 'question', 'ask', 'Why', 'do', 'love', 'Bradys', 'so', 'much', 'answer', 'simple', 'were', 'one', 'most', 'unrealistic', 'shows', 'something', 'hope', 'When', 'life', 'bad', 'can', 'escape', 'Bradyville', 'where', 'everything', 'always', 'well.Growing', 'watching', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'who', 'least', 'once', 'did', ""n't"", 'wish', 'last', 'name', 'was', 'Brady']",The Brady Bunch Variety Hour
556122,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B00004WMP2,JGC,"[7, 7]","The Brady Bunch Variety Hour was produced at the height of the outrageous '70s high-camp musical era. So perhaps it's no coincidence that this DVD is so bad and so over-the-top that it's both funny and very colorful. If you love the BB (and really who doesn't?) you will just love this DVD.Florence Henderson and Robert Reed (may he rest in peace) each reprise their roles as Mrs. and Mrs. Mike Brady. Rounding out the cast are those super-cool Brady kids: Christopher Knight (Chris has always been my very favorite Brady because he is so sweet and sensitive), Barry Williams, Mike Lookinland, Maureen ""oh my nose"" McCormick, and Susan Olsen (who has a really groovy new feathered hairstyle). What I enjoy most about watching everyone together again is that it's like watching a group of familiar old friends.Each ep is 50 minutes in total and as far as I can tell these are the full and unedited versions (I have no recollection of seeing this series on TV as it predates my birth by many years.) Included on this set are 2 eps from the variety series:Volume 1 / episode #1 (original airdate: 11-28-76) - This is the first ep (after their special that aired a month earlier) and includes lots of groovy singing and dancing. Guest stars include Tony Randall and Donny and Marie.Volume 2 / episode #4 (original airdate: 3-4-77) - Greg decides to move out of the Brady home and an entire ep, complete with corny singing and melodramatic acting compliments this ludicrous show. Vincent Price guest stars in this ep; don't worry though he isn't tying the boys to a giant tiki. Rip Taylor (you know it's going to be hoot with him) and the cast of H.R. Pufnstuf are also in this ep.Alice (Ann B. Davis) is on both eps. She even sings a little too. I love the sequined pants suits she wears; it's so much cuter than the pale blue maid's uniform (which, incidentally she also wears, because after all, she's still Alice). For reasons that are unclear to me, Ms. Davis does not receive star billing; instead she is billed as a ""guest star.""Noticeably absent from this BB reincarnation is Eve. I am not sure why Eve didn't participate in this; either she had something else going on or she didn't have a momentary lapse in good judgement like the rest. Geri Reischl aka ""fake Jan"" was, like all the others, excellent and offered up a beautiful singing voice, although she doesn't seem like she's as much of an overdone drama queen as Eve (who has always been one of my favorite Bradys, btw!!).The Halston body suits, the loud print colors, the hip-huggers, the bell-bottoms, those super-super tight vests the men wore and all that glitter and rhinestones perhaps is one of the reasons why this series is so grounded in '70s culture. It's just so ridiculous and almost surreal to watch the Bradys singing and dancing all made up like the La Cage aux Folles dancers. It is just the end and I love it.The DVD includes a brand-new (well 10 years old) interview with Susan and Mike. The interview is a full 20 minutes long. They discuss the original series, the Variety Hour and some of the other BB projects. As a fan that has followed the BB for my entire life this is truly one of the best interviews I have ever seen.The DVD includes a colorful menu (taken from the series opening credits) which also plays music and even has chapter selections. There is also a colorful insert included. BTW I scanned everything just in case you'd like to see what it looks like.Maybe you're down in the dumps and just need a little lift. The Bradys to the rescue! Because it's impossible to view The Brady Bunch Variety Hour without smiling and laughing.

Itlasted less than ten episodes, and no wonder it has been forgotten byfans and viewers, and conveniently left off of the resumes of allthose involved in making the program.The well-loved Brady Bunchgathers together for another Brady show, the first after the originalwas cancelled. Unfortunately, this one was created by Sid &amp; MartyKrofft of Saturday morning Super Seven fame. '70s disco-spangledweirdness is at full power!The Brady kids (especially Greg),wanted to get into music, like the Partridges. They put out severalalbums (some have been re-issued on CD), so naturally the producersfelt this would be a hit show with a built-in audience.All of theoriginal cast but Jan signed on, leading to the Brady conundrum ofwhat has become known as the &quot;Fake Jan&quot; character, areplacement Brady!Of all the Brady cast, only Greg &amp; Carol canactually sing. Marsha and the Fake Jan can manage.The showappeared at the peak of television musical variety shows in the'70s. Donny &amp; Marie, Sonny &amp; Cher, Captain &amp; Tennille,Tony Orlando & Dawn, The Osmond Family, and others were part of agenre of television that has largely been forgotten. Every week wouldbring a new guest star and/or singing act. Only &quot;Saturday NightLive&quot; survives the variety show era and is still in productiontoday.The Brady show boasted two innovations, the Rockette wannabesknown as the &quot;Krofftette Dancers &amp; Water Follies&quot;, and aset that featured a large swimming pool for the underwater balletswimmers. Both are just weird when juxtaposed with the Bradys!Onthe DVD, two shows are featured, with guest stars Ann B. Davis(Alice), Tony Randall, Rip Taylor, Vincent Price, Donny &amp; MarieOsmond, and H.R.

There were also some great guest stars like Tina Turner, Vincent Price, Charro, etc. To get through this day-glo glittery confection, you have to disconnect yourself from the original show and view the actors as themselves rather than as The Brady Bunch. Then it works, at least for me. This show is so alien from the happenings at 4222 Clinton Avenue that I really don't see this as a sequel or even related to the original show. It's just too bizarre a concept, which is probably why TV Guide rated it as the #4 worse show ever. Whenever I view it, I see Florence, Robert, Barry, Maureen, Susan, etc. and not their Brady characters. When they do a sketch of the Brady Bunch in their new ""home"", I see them re-enacting a Brady scene, but it still doesn't feel like the original show because of the different setting. Had they used the original Brady Bunch set for those portions, that might have helped to make more of a connection between the two shows.The show was produced by Sid and Marty Kroft, who produced ""The Donny and Marie Show."" That show works because Donny and Marie were experienced entertainers/singers, whereas the Brady Bunch (save for Florence Henderson), were not.  Donny and Marie did not have a beloved sit-com in syndication prior to their variety show, so there was no previous image of them to compete with their variety show, as opposed to The Brady Bunch. Donny and Marie on a variety show makes sense; The Brady Bunch on one does not.Perhaps my disconnect is helped by the fact that I only watched The Brady Bunch for the first three seasons, so the people I see on the Variety Hour do not look like the little kids I remember. They have matured considerably. Even Florence looks different with her Dorothy Hamill Wedge Haircut as opposed to her infamous Carol Brady Shag. ""Fake Jan"" Geri Reischl alters the dynamic dramatically with her presence. ""Fake Jan"" can out-sing and out-dance Maureen (Marcia), something that the original Jan wouldn't have done; she was supposed to be the middle child stuck in Marcia's shadow.Given their limitations, the actors did a decent job with this show. I loved the Kroffettes, but their presence adds to the befuddlement of the audience. But they really add to the cheese factor of this show, making it genuine kitsch.Again, view this show as a 1970s variety hour starring the ACTORS of The Brady Bunch, then mabe it will begin to make more sense!",5,So Bad It's Good...LOVE the DISCO-Era Brady Bunch Actors!,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,2535,"['love', 'show', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'bad', 'good', 'songs', 'sing', 'take', 'back', 'childhood', '1970s', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Charro', 'etc', 'get', 'day-glo', 'glittery', 'confection', 'have', 'disconnect', 'original', 'show', 'view', 'actors', 'rather', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Then', 'least', 'show', 'so', 'alien', 'happenings', '4222', 'Clinton', 'Avenue', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'sequel', 'even', 'related', 'original', 'show', 'just', 'too', 'bizarre', 'concept', 'probably', 'why', 'TV', 'Guide', 'rated', '4', 'worse', 'show', 'ever', 'Whenever', 'view', 'see', 'Florence', 'Robert', 'Barry', 'Maureen', 'Susan', 'etc', 'not', 'Brady', 'characters', 'When', 'do', 'sketch', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'new', 'home', 'see', 're-enacting', 'Brady', 'scene', 'still', ""n't"", 'feel', 'original', 'show', 'different', 'setting', 'Had', 'used', 'original', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'set', 'portions', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'make', 'more', 'connection', 'two', 'shows.The', 'show', 'was', 'produced', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'Kroft', 'who', 'produced', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'Show', 'show', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'were', 'experienced', 'entertainers/singers', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'save', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'were', 'not', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'beloved', 'sit-com', 'syndication', 'prior', 'variety', 'show', 'was', 'previous', 'image', 'compete', 'variety', 'show', 'opposed', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Donny', 'Marie', 'variety', 'show', 'sense', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'one', 'not.Perhaps', 'disconnect', 'helped', 'fact', 'only', 'watched', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'people', 'see', 'Variety', 'Hour', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'little', 'kids', 'remember', 'have', 'matured', 'considerably', 'Even', 'Florence', 'different', 'Dorothy', 'Hamill', 'Wedge', 'Haircut', 'opposed', 'infamous', 'Carol', 'Brady', 'Shag', 'Fake', 'Jan', 'Geri', 'Reischl', 'dynamic', 'dramatically', 'presence', 'Fake', 'Jan', 'can', 'out-sing', 'out-dance', 'Maureen', 'Marcia', 'something', 'original', 'Jan', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'middle', 'child', 'stuck', 'Marcia', 'shadow.Given', 'limitations', 'actors', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'show', 'loved', 'Kroffettes', 'presence', 'befuddlement', 'audience', 'really', 'add', 'cheese', 'factor', 'show', 'making', 'genuine', 'kitsch.Again', 'view', 'show', '1970s', 'variety', 'hour', 'starring', 'ACTORS', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'then', 'will', 'begin', 'make', 'more', 'sense']",The Brady Bunch Variety Hour

We've had them in many incarnations:  Original Bradys, Brady Brides, Brady Christmases and so on.  But for one glorious moment in time; for nine episodes in 1976/1977, we had disco Bradys.  Once in a while a show comes along that boggles the mind, and entertains you in a way that you won't admit out in public.  The Brady Bunch Variety Hour is one such show.  One part wholesome Brady, one part disco and one part ""comedy"" skits that will make you laugh only if you're very, very drunk.This DVD, which has excellent picture and sound quality, features two of the hour-long episodes.  For the life of me, I can't figure out why they haven't released the other seven.  This is time capsule worthy if we want to confuse future generations.  Bedecked in bright orange and hot pink clothes, the Bradys dance, sing, attempt a little comedy...very little comedy (the scripts are ridiculously bad) and make 70s references about ""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" and `up your nose' kind of humor.  Add in the Water Follies girls diving into a large pool and swimming around like they are a poor man's Esther Williams, and you have a recipe for the kind of 70s weirdness that makes for a good time.Guest stars in episode one are Tony Randall and Donny & Marie Osmond.Songs in the first episode include:""Baby Face,"" ""One"" from ""A Chorus Line,"" ""Splish Splash,"" ""Memories,"" ""Attitude Dancing,"" ""Heaven,"" ""Dance with Me,"" ""I Could Have Danced All Night,"" ""The Hustle"" and the most watered down version of ""Shake Your Booty"" that you'll ever hear.  Kudos to Ann B. Davis who gets out there and shakes hers better than the young ones.Guest stars in episode two are:  Vincent Price, Rip Taylor & HR PufnstufSongs in the second episode include:""Keep Your Sunny Side Up,"" ""It's Not Where You Start,"" ""All By Myself,"" performed by Barry Williams & Florence Henderson ""Time in a Bottle"" performed by Maureen McCormick, ""I Want to Be Happy,"" ""You've Made Me So Very Happy,"" ""Make Someone Happy,"" ""Put On A Happy Face,"" ""Happy Days,"" ""United We Stand.""Florence Henderson can sing, but her voice is better suited for Broadway than K.C. and the Sunshine Band.  Geri Reischl (Fake Jan...Eve Plumb was a no-show for this outing), Barry Williams and Maureen McCormick have decent voices, too.""Comedy"" skits include:  Brady problems, like Bobby thinking their father's musical skills ""stink"" too much to play their father in the variety show.  And my personal favorite - Greg wants to move out of the house, and the whole family has a complete come apart.  ""Carol"" acts like she's going to have a nervous breakdown.  Since he was about 23 at the time, this makes it even more hilariously absurd.There's also a DVD extra - an interview with Susan Olsen (Cindy) and Mike Lookinland (Bobby), who says he remembers very little about this show...convenient memory or denial?

Immediately telling of how bad this project really is, 'the family' is too busy embarrassing themselves to notice how different Jan looks.Did the `square' Bradys only decide to do this show under the influence of powerful drugs----which would also make them forget what each other had actually looked like?And, making things even worse, the fake Jan is only the immediately noticeable snafu in this abomination.The Bradys are doing `numbers' which poorly fit with their previously well-established wholesome motif. Granted, they have to work with the hairstyles of the time...etc (and everybody WANTED their network to have at LEAST one variety show) but even with this perspective, the show reeked of VERY FOUL cheese.Exacerbating the problem is the obvious appropriation of stars/characters who were `cool' (Donny Osmond seriously trying to pretend he is Henry Winkler playing ""Fonzie"" from `Happy Days') since the life of this quickly tired joke was not able to be prolonged on it's own merits.Even in those disco-drenched days, the late 70's still produced family-friendly sitcoms. If Hollywood had really wanted to successfully capitalize on why the Bradys were a hit with the American public, they would have actually THOUGHT about keeping the series characters a little consistent to their earlier selves.Realizing that a studio executive, writing/production team actually got approved and paid for this project is amazing. I am still tempted to believe series creators fudged details to studio executives (like the series's general bizarreness) in order to put it on the air. The sets...etc actually look like they had been designed during a bad acid trip and/or seizure.Ironically, Robert Reed (who was infamous for his many on-the set disagreements in the earlier series) liked the variety hour only because it gave him the chance to gain experience performing in a `variety show' format. Yet, the genuine intra-cast camaraderie (including with the new Jan) alone was obviously not enough to save this blatant mistake. If there is a museum of atrocious television, this series MUST become a main exhibit.I shudder to think what will happen to civilization if history repeats itself and allows a show like this to get on the air.
