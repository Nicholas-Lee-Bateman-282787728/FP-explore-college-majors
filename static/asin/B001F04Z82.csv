The message of shifting from the ambition stage of life to the desire for deeper meaning and connectedness in ""adolescence"" of our life was so clearly stated and expressed. It seemed as if Dr. Dyer was speaking of my life when he discussed the Quantum Shift. I've experienced this! It is indeed memorable, sudden, a surprise, sustaining...and I do remember everything about the moment when the shift occurred. My life will never be the same. Beautiful message about what really matters in life and following THAT! Worth watching again and again.",5,Quantum Shift spoke directly to my soul,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,561,"['Loved', 'DVD', 'message', 'shifting', 'ambition', 'stage', 'life', 'desire', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'connectedness', 'adolescence', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'clearly', 'stated', 'expressed', 'seemed', 'Dr.', 'Dyer', 'was', 'speaking', 'life', 'when', 'discussed', 'Quantum', 'Shift', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'indeed', 'memorable', 'sudden', 'surprise', 'sustaining', 'do', 'remember', 'everything', 'moment', 'when', 'shift', 'occurred', 'My', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'Beautiful', 'message', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'life', 'following', 'Worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again']",Ambition to Meaning: Finding Your Life's Purposes
1186949,A224NBGT01D660,B001F04Z82,"Chris Cade ""Your Partner In Transformation""","[4, 5]","I found this movie to be a bittersweet experience. On one hand, I enjoyed the three plotlines thoroughly and found myself touched on more than oneoccasion. I found it delightful to watch as three people made the shift from having no clue about their purpose to discovering a divinity with themselves that illuminates their lives (and the lives of others). The acting was not only believable, but tangible and real. It was also easy to see a bit of myself in each of the characters, and that's testament not just to the acting, but also the writing.On the flip side, I feel that Wayne got in the way of what could have brought the movie to even greater heights. The scenes with him come across as a little bit too preachy for my preference. Though the content of his monologues is informative, I wonder if his core messages may be lost in the sea of of telling people how things are... moreso than encouraging their own process of self-discovery.There are some parts of the movie where a nice balance is struck between these two seemingly opposite experiences of the movie. At some points after the main characters experienced moments of significance, Wayne voices over with some insight that indirectly illuminates what the main characters were going through. I find these third person narratives to be welcoming.Though I wish the movie had less of Wayne's monologues and more of the three plot lines, this movie is still one that has the power to change lives. If you can see past the preachy nature of his monologues, and understand and embody the concepts he talks about, then you will experience meaningful changes in your life. Seeing the other characters in the movie go through this process provides a tangible and realistic example that may help shed light on your own spiritual development process.As with all spiritual content, each person will have a different experience of this movie. For me, this movie was entertaining, and at some points touching. For other people, Ambition to Meaning may serve as an amazing opening into a new way of being.",4,"Though it Has Room for Improvement, It's Still Worth Watching",1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,2058,"['found', 'movie', 'be', 'bittersweet', 'experience', 'one', 'hand', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'plotlines', 'thoroughly', 'found', 'touched', 'more', 'oneoccasion', 'found', 'delightful', 'watch', 'three', 'people', 'made', 'shift', 'having', 'clue', 'purpose', 'discovering', 'divinity', 'lives', 'lives', 'others', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'believable', 'tangible', 'real', 'was', 'also', 'easy', 'see', 'bit', 'characters', 'testament', 'not', 'just', 'acting', 'also', 'writing.On', 'flip', 'side', 'feel', 'Wayne', 'got', 'way', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'movie', 'even', 'greater', 'heights', 'scenes', 'come', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'preachy', 'preference', 'content', 'monologues', 'informative', 'wonder', 'core', 'messages', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'sea', 'telling', 'people', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'moreso', 'encouraging', 'own', 'process', 'self-discovery.There', 'are', 'parts', 'movie', 'where', 'nice', 'balance', 'struck', 'two', 'seemingly', 'opposite', 'experiences', 'movie', 'points', 'main', 'characters', 'experienced', 'moments', 'significance', 'Wayne', 'over', 'insight', 'indirectly', 'what', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'going', 'find', 'third', 'person', 'narratives', 'be', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'less', 'Wayne', 'monologues', 'more', 'three', 'plot', 'lines', 'movie', 'still', 'one', 'power', 'change', 'lives', 'can', 'see', 'preachy', 'nature', 'monologues', 'understand', 'embody', 'concepts', 'about', 'then', 'will', 'experience', 'meaningful', 'changes', 'life', 'Seeing', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'go', 'process', 'tangible', 'realistic', 'example', 'may', 'help', 'shed', 'light', 'own', 'spiritual', 'development', 'process.As', 'spiritual', 'content', 'person', 'will', 'have', 'different', 'experience', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'points', 'touching', 'other', 'people', 'Ambition', 'Meaning', 'may', 'serve', 'amazing', 'opening', 'new', 'way', 'being']",Ambition to Meaning: Finding Your Life's Purposes

1186952,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B001F04Z82,Kathy W,"[0, 1]","A 2009 release from Hay House, this DVD is absolutely beyond fantastic!  The movie is approximately 2 hours long.  Wayne Dyer ""explores the spiritual journey from ambition to meaning.""  The focus is on shifting from the ego's perspective of accumulating and achieving to a life of service, of giving back.  (This does NOT mean you have to be a nun or priest to give back.)We begin by entering the bedroom of a small trailer in a peaceful country setting and we observe as the clock changes to 3:13 a.m.  Wayne Dyer awakens, expresses gratitude by saying ""Thank You"" exactly 3 times, puts on his slippers and shuffles over to his writing pad and begins reading Jung and writing notes on a pad of paper.We briefly shift focus to meet 3 groups of people.  First, we meet a couple and their children preparing to leave for a weekend getaway.  While taking on the nurturing role of wife and mother of 2 young boys, a woman has lost focus of who she is inside.In another location, a hard-driving businessman, obsessed with achievement, argues with his lawyer over a building project.  He has lost focus of his wife and the love they once shared.  Money now rules.Then we meet a movie director, arguing with his agent over financing for a film, as he prepares to do the Wayne Dyer interview.  He is so obsessed with seeing his pet project come to fruition that he has lost touch with all else.  Isn't it synchronicity that all 3 groups wind up at the same hotel.In a series of interviews at this beautiful California resort, Dr. Dyer begins to dialog about finding your life's purpose.  Reminding us that we are created with everything we need, Wayne tells us we just need to go forth from there.  We are perfect in the beginning, but then e.g.o. (edge God out) takes over and we get sidetracked. We begin to want more, and more, and still more.  We begin to believe we are what we have and what we do.  We become consumed with who we are, and with what we have/make/achieve.  We compete constantly.We also learn to believe that we are what others think of us.  The ego also teaches us we are separate from everyone else and separate from God and separate from that which we believe is missing in our life. So we end up living a lie.  We tend to live in ego, feeling stress and disharmony, instead of living in dharma (a higher place) and feeling bliss. You even begin to re-define what success means to you. What satisfied you before is no longer enough.  You want more.Dr Dyer talks about how he also struggled with ego earlier in his career.  He worried over money and success.  In his case, he began shifting toward spirituality from within himself and recognized it.  He explained that you get to a place where you begin to be guided by something larger than yourself.  Dyer also talks about the Tao, frequently, and allowing Source to work its magic if you just stop interfering in your own life.Throughout the story, the others lives are all intertwined at this resort and they walk through the process of realization and a shift in thinking.  You clearly see the egos in action as people do not get what they want and the way they react, as well as the effect it has on those around them.  Dr Dyer talks about quantum moments, the effects of which reside with you forever and about beginning a path to awareness.  He explains that once you are (re)connected to Source, the other stuff is no longer relevant in your life. When you are supported by Source, you have a knowing, a wisdom and there is such a beauty of reaching out to help another.  You attract what you are, not what you want.  Just show up and make your own music.  Prepare and let go.  Trust that everything will happen perfectly, as it is supposed to.  Just trust and let go. We are here to enjoy life and live in peaceIf you loved Louise Hay's ""You Can Heal Your Life"" DVD, this is on the same order and you will likely love this DVD too.  It is profound and can be life changing.  If it doesn't affect you positively, you really need to wake up!  (Sorry)  I can tell you emphatically that this DVD is priceless!  Be sure to watch the movie credits for a final smile.Namaste'",5,Finding Peace and Love,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,4143,"['2009', 'release', 'Hay', 'House', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'approximately', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'Wayne', 'Dyer', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'ambition', 'meaning', 'focus', 'shifting', 'ego', 'perspective', 'accumulating', 'achieving', 'life', 'service', 'giving', 'back', 'NOT', 'mean', 'have', 'be', 'nun', 'priest', 'give', 'back', 'begin', 'entering', 'bedroom', 'small', 'trailer', 'peaceful', 'country', 'setting', 'observe', 'clock', 'changes', '3:13', 'a.m.', 'Wayne', 'Dyer', 'expresses', 'gratitude', 'saying', 'Thank', 'exactly', '3', 'times', 'slippers', 'shuffles', 'writing', 'pad', 'reading', 'Jung', 'writing', 'notes', 'pad', 'paper.We', 'briefly', 'shift', 'focus', 'meet', '3', 'groups', 'people', 'First', 'meet', 'couple', 'children', 'preparing', 'leave', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'taking', 'nurturing', 'role', 'wife', 'mother', '2', 'young', 'boys', 'woman', 'lost', 'focus', 'who', 'inside.In', 'location', 'hard-driving', 'businessman', 'obsessed', 'achievement', 'lawyer', 'building', 'project', 'lost', 'focus', 'wife', 'love', 'once', 'shared', 'Money', 'now', 'meet', 'movie', 'director', 'arguing', 'agent', 'financing', 'film', 'do', 'Wayne', 'Dyer', 'interview', 'so', 'obsessed', 'seeing', 'pet', 'project', 'come', 'fruition', 'lost', 'touch', 'else', ""n't"", 'synchronicity', '3', 'groups', 'wind', 'up', 'same', 'hotel.In', 'series', 'interviews', 'beautiful', 'California', 'resort', 'Dr.', 'Dyer', 'dialog', 'finding', 'life', 'purpose', 'Reminding', 'are', 'created', 'everything', 'need', 'Wayne', 'just', 'need', 'go', 'forth', 'there', 'are', 'perfect', 'beginning', 'then', 'e.g.o', 'edge', 'God', 'out', 'get', 'sidetracked', 'begin', 'want', 'more', 'more', 'still', 'more', 'begin', 'believe', 'are', 'what', 'have', 'what', 'do', 'become', 'consumed', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'have/make/achieve', 'compete', 'constantly.We', 'also', 'learn', 'believe', 'are', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'ego', 'also', 'are', 'separate', 'everyone', 'else', 'separate', 'God', 'separate', 'believe', 'missing', 'life', 'end', 'up', 'living', 'lie', 'tend', 'live', 'ego', 'feeling', 'stress', 'disharmony', 'instead', 'living', 'dharma', 'higher', 'place', 'feeling', 'bliss', 'even', 'begin', 're-define', 'what', 'success', 'What', 'satisfied', 'longer', 'enough', 'want', 'more.Dr', 'Dyer', 'talks', 'how', 'also', 'struggled', 'ego', 'earlier', 'career', 'worried', 'money', 'success', 'case', 'began', 'shifting', 'spirituality', 'recognized', 'explained', 'get', 'place', 'where', 'begin', 'be', 'guided', 'something', 'larger', 'Dyer', 'also', 'Tao', 'frequently', 'allowing', 'Source', 'work', 'magic', 'just', 'stop', 'interfering', 'own', 'life.Throughout', 'story', 'others', 'lives', 'are', 'intertwined', 'resort', 'walk', 'process', 'realization', 'shift', 'thinking', 'clearly', 'see', 'egos', 'action', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'way', 'react', 'as', 'well', 'effect', 'Dr', 'Dyer', 'talks', 'quantum', 'moments', 'effects', 'reside', 'forever', 'beginning', 'path', 'awareness', 'once', 'are', 're', 'connected', 'Source', 'other', 'stuff', 'no', 'longer', 'relevant', 'life', 'When', 'are', 'supported', 'Source', 'have', 'knowing', 'wisdom', 'such', 'beauty', 'reaching', 'out', 'help', 'attract', 'what', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'want', 'Just', 'show', 'up', 'make', 'own', 'music', 'Prepare', 'let', 'go', 'Trust', 'everything', 'will', 'happen', 'perfectly', 'supposed', 'Just', 'trust', 'let', 'go', 'are', 'here', 'enjoy', 'life', 'live', 'peaceIf', 'loved', 'Louise', 'Hay', 'Can', 'Heal', 'Your', 'Life', 'DVD', 'same', 'order', 'will', 'likely', 'love', 'DVD', 'too', 'profound', 'can', 'be', 'life', 'changing', ""n't"", 'affect', 'positively', 'really', 'need', 'wake', 'up', 'Sorry', 'can', 'tell', 'emphatically', 'DVD', 'priceless', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'movie', 'credits', 'final', 'smile.Namaste']",Ambition to Meaning: Finding Your Life's Purposes
1186953,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B001F04Z82,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 0]","For anyone who ever needed clarfication about what ego can and cannot do for us as individuals, this film will clarify that very well.  Although meant to be a movie, I found it to be more of a documentary with actors presenting how other people's lives and situations can change when we allow them, as human beings, to happen.  The basic premise is that we are all part of the same ""source"" and as such we all have our purpose in life.  The hardest part is figuring out what that purpose is and how to align it with our present situation in life.By combining philosophical thoughts, human psychology and ancient teaching from China, Dr. Dyer shows us through (fictional) lives of others how we can make or allow a ""shift"" that is necessary to make any person's life easier.  The purpose and meaning of life basically comes to being able to accept the virtues of life as prescribed by the ancient teachers.  And as if nothing is absolute, it is just amazing that teachings from thousands of years ago are still holding up in our today's busy world.Many seeking self-help and self improvement will find this video helpful.  I found it interesting.  Film definitely reminded me that is it time to re-read a famous ""Tao Te Ching"".",4,Dr. Dyer lets u sknow how to let go of ego,1274486400,"05 22, 2010",2010,1226,"['anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'needed', 'clarfication', 'what', 'ego', 'can', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'individuals', 'film', 'will', 'clarify', 'very', 'well', 'meant', 'be', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'documentary', 'actors', 'presenting', 'how', 'other', 'people', 'lives', 'situations', 'can', 'change', 'when', 'allow', 'human', 'beings', 'happen', 'basic', 'premise', 'are', 'part', 'same', 'source', 'such', 'have', 'purpose', 'life', 'hardest', 'part', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'purpose', 'how', 'align', 'present', 'situation', 'life.By', 'combining', 'philosophical', 'thoughts', 'human', 'psychology', 'ancient', 'teaching', 'China', 'Dr.', 'Dyer', 'fictional', 'lives', 'others', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'allow', 'shift', 'necessary', 'make', 'person', 'life', 'easier', 'purpose', 'meaning', 'life', 'basically', 'being', 'able', 'accept', 'virtues', 'life', 'prescribed', 'ancient', 'teachers', 'nothing', 'absolute', 'just', 'amazing', 'teachings', 'thousands', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'still', 'holding', 'up', 'today', 'busy', 'world.Many', 'seeking', 'self-help', 'self', 'improvement', 'will', 'find', 'video', 'helpful', 'found', 'interesting', 'Film', 'definitely', 'reminded', 'time', 're-read', 'famous', 'Tao', 'Te', 'Ching']",Ambition to Meaning: Finding Your Life's Purposes
