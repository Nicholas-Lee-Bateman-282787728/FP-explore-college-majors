It appealed to the viewer on more of a psychological level.  Overall, not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.  Not over-the-top like many of today's prison films which heavily rely on blood & gore.  This one has depth to its characters & I thought this was truly well done.  It's based on a play by the same name.  If you like good, offbeat prison pictures that examine its characters & maintains realism in the process, this is a good choice.  It's a cult classic.  I wonder when MGM will finally get on the ball & put this on DVD.",5,Don't listen to the negative reviews...,1196640000,"12 3, 2007",2007,672,"['was', 'decent', 'prison', 'film', 'hooked', 'viewer', 'kept', 'interested', 'plot', 'characters', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'interesting', 'appealed', 'viewer', 'more', 'psychological', 'level', 'Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'Not', 'over-the-top', 'many', 'today', 'prison', 'films', 'heavily', 'rely', 'blood', 'gore', 'one', 'depth', 'characters', 'thought', 'was', 'truly', 'well', 'done', 'based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'like', 'good', 'offbeat', 'prison', 'pictures', 'examine', 'characters', 'maintains', 'realism', 'process', 'good', 'choice', 'cult', 'classic', 'wonder', 'when', 'MGM', 'will', 'finally', 'get', 'ball', 'put', 'DVD']",N/A

Taylor ""GFT""","[25, 29]","Interesting but significantly watered-down version of the claustrophobic, searing stage play concerning the sexual liaisons between young men in a juvenile prison.  While the film is essentially explotative in tone, and  comes no where near depicting the brutality of the prison system, it raises  a number of legitimate issues and questions re homosexuality in prison and  sexual role-playing in gay society.  No laurels for the script, but the  performers are strong and the film itself well-made.  Not wildly memorable,  but worth a watch.",3,Interesting...,936489600,"09 5, 1999",1999,542,"['Interesting', 'significantly', 'watered-down', 'version', 'claustrophobic', 'searing', 'stage', 'play', 'concerning', 'sexual', 'liaisons', 'young', 'men', 'juvenile', 'prison', 'film', 'essentially', 'explotative', 'tone', 'where', 'depicting', 'brutality', 'prison', 'system', 'number', 'legitimate', 'issues', 'questions', 're', 'homosexuality', 'prison', 'sexual', 'role-playing', 'gay', 'society', 'laurels', 'script', 'performers', 'are', 'strong', 'film', 'well-made', 'Not', 'wildly', 'memorable', 'watch']",N/A
321860,A7Y6AVS576M03,6302593352,gobirds2,"[13, 14]","This is a brutally realistic prison film. The very nave Smitty, the main character played by Wendell Burton, goes to prison where he is totally unprepared for his harrowing experiences. I saw this movie in the theater when it was first released. I was in high school and it was a very disturbing and frightening film to sit through. Director Harvey Hart's film is brutal, harsh and very realistic. Its effect is very claustrophobic as Smitty grimly comes to the realization that there is no one to turn to and no way out of his horrific situation. This film is several years ahead of its time, engrossing but at times hard to watch.",4,Welcome to the Real World,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,632,"['brutally', 'realistic', 'prison', 'film', 'very', 'nave', 'Smitty', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Wendell', 'Burton', 'prison', 'where', 'totally', 'unprepared', 'harrowing', 'experiences', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'very', 'disturbing', 'frightening', 'film', 'sit', 'Director', 'Harvey', 'Hart', 'film', 'brutal', 'harsh', 'very', 'realistic', 'effect', 'very', 'claustrophobic', 'Smitty', 'grimly', 'realization', 'one', 'turn', 'way', 'horrific', 'situation', 'film', 'several', 'years', 'ahead', 'time', 'engrossing', 'times', 'hard', 'watch']",N/A

Since I was an actor, I introduced myself and complimented him on both his stage and screen work in ""Fortune.""  He was completely different than the character, ""Queenie.""  He was a normal-acting guy, who was personable and chatty. Greer said doing the play was more fun, but he was happy to have it on film. We had a nice chat.I liked the movie.  Firstly, Ronnie Dyson did a wonderful singing job on the tile song. Just beautiful.  The movie moved well and was never boring.  One kind of sits on the edge of one's seat expecting the next explosive scene.  The movie was well-shot, especially in those tiny cells. Wendell Burton was properly boy next door, Danny Freedman was sympathetic as a passed-around-for-sex gay boy and Zooey Hall played his part well, but I wasn't convinced with that haircut.The other actors, especially L&aacute;zaro P&eacute;rez as ""Catso"" and and Larry Perkins as ""Screwdriver"" were very convincing.  Michael Greer was completely outrageous as ""Queenie"" and all but stole the movie.The gang rape of one young man sent chills down my spine, but when ""Smitty"" (Burton) was raped, it was graphic, but tastefully filmed. I own the VHS, but would love to have this and ""Boys In The Band"" on DVD.I enjoyed it.",4,I Had The Chance To Discuss This With Michael Greer,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,1374,"['had', 'seen', 'onstage', 'New', 'York', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'ran', 'Michael', 'Greer', 'bar', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'was', 'playing', 'video', 'game', 'was', 'actor', 'introduced', 'complimented', 'stage', 'screen', 'work', 'Fortune', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'character', 'Queenie', 'was', 'normal-acting', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'personable', 'chatty', 'Greer', 'said', 'doing', 'play', 'was', 'more', 'fun', 'was', 'happy', 'have', 'film', 'had', 'nice', 'chat.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'Firstly', 'Ronnie', 'Dyson', 'did', 'wonderful', 'singing', 'job', 'tile', 'song', 'Just', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'moved', 'well', 'was', 'never', 'boring', 'One', 'kind', 'sits', 'edge', 'one', 'seat', 'expecting', 'next', 'explosive', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'well-shot', 'especially', 'tiny', 'cells', 'Wendell', 'Burton', 'was', 'properly', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'Danny', 'Freedman', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'passed-around-for-sex', 'gay', 'boy', 'Zooey', 'Hall', 'played', 'part', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'other', 'actors', 'especially', 'L', 'aacute', 'zaro', 'P', 'eacute', 'Catso', 'Larry', 'Perkins', 'Screwdriver', 'were', 'very', 'convincing', 'Michael', 'Greer', 'was', 'completely', 'outrageous', 'Queenie', 'stole', 'movie.The', 'gang', 'rape', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'sent', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'when', 'Smitty', 'Burton', 'was', 'raped', 'was', 'graphic', 'tastefully', 'filmed', 'own', 'VHS', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'Boys', 'Band', 'DVD.I', 'enjoyed']",N/A
