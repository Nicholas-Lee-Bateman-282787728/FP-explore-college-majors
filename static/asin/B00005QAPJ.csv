674145,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005QAPJ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[8, 10]","I would like to begin by saying that this is one of the most bizarre films that I have ever experienced in my career as a movie buff.  I have seen some twist endings, some passionately bad French films, and even some stalker films, but nothing compares to the cinematic genius that I just witnessed.  Being a Bunuel ""virgin"", I didn't know what to expect coming into this film.  I was ready for anything, but interestingly enough nothing will prepare you for this film.  Deeply rooted in cinematic symbolism, we watch as two very interesting devises that are used to bring forth the overall theme of this film.  Two devises that I have never seen used in a movie, until now.The first is the obvious.  Bunuel successfully uses two different actresses to play the same role of Conchita.  At first I thought perhaps it was going to be one of those ""twin"" double-cross films where these two girls used this older wealthy man for all his money.  I was wrong.  Similar to the title of this film, this is a film about passions and desires.  It divulges in the emotion of obsession, and the reaction a man can have on someone that he desperately and sexually desires.  Mathieu is our possible victim in this story.  While both are not the most interesting characters (both have flaws and troubles), they do provide some structured characters.  Mathieu is willing to give up everything for this woman that he hardly knows, but is physically attracted to her.  It is hard to say that he loves her, but he does lust for her.  The dual role of Conchita in this film is used for two purposes.  The first is as a distraction, while the second is emotion.  Both Conchitas are different in their own way and are used to push forward the story.  Whenever Bunuel needed to convey a different emotion, he would bring in the actress that best represented that emotion.  At first it was confusing, but as the film progressed you began to see less and less separate actresses, but instead as one character.  It is impressive how Bunuel created this illusion.As I mentioned above, there were two devises that I have never seen in a movie before.  I explained above about the use of two women for one female role, but the second is a bit subtler.  I briefly mentioned it above about how these two women (one character) were used to distract.  If you pay attention to the film terrorism is a big part of the universe surrounding Mathieu.  While he pines continually for Conchita, the world around him is falling apart.  Bombings and deaths are at an all time high, yet he doesn't really seem to notice this.  He is so caught up in Conchita that it seems like nothing else exists.  He is oblivious to his surroundings.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that we are also oblivious to the surroundings.  Bunuel does this job of keeping our eye focused on the interchanging women that we sometimes forget or miss the actions surrounding this film.  I believe that Bunuel is trying to prove the point that obsession does obscure your vision.  It blurs your eyes and forces you to miss crucial elements of your surroundings.  It isn't until the end when we are reminded violently of the truth surrounding our characters.  I felt that Bunuel was slapping me in the face with that final scene.  I had nearly forgotten myself of the terrorism outside, but easily he reminded me.This was a spectacular film that really opened my eyes to a completely new way of filmmaking.  It reminded me of some of the early works of another favorite director of mine Francois Ozon.  Both of these talented artists have their own way of creating a world and an emotion, and both do it with some of the most beautiful strokes of their mechanical brush.  I would recommend this film to anyone that is willing to experience radical, yet provocative filmmaking at its best.  You will be impressed.I cannot wait to include this film in my collection to watch over and over again.  Thanks to Criterion, they have provided a beautiful packaging to this obscure film.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,My Conchita...,1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,4038,"['would', 'like', 'begin', 'saying', 'one', 'most', 'bizarre', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced', 'career', 'movie', 'buff', 'have', 'seen', 'twist', 'endings', 'passionately', 'bad', 'French', 'films', 'even', 'stalker', 'films', 'nothing', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'just', 'witnessed', 'Being', 'Bunuel', 'virgin', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'coming', 'film', 'was', 'ready', 'anything', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'nothing', 'will', 'prepare', 'film', 'Deeply', 'rooted', 'cinematic', 'symbolism', 'watch', 'two', 'very', 'interesting', 'devises', 'are', 'used', 'bring', 'forth', 'overall', 'theme', 'film', 'Two', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'used', 'movie', 'now.The', 'first', 'obvious', 'Bunuel', 'successfully', 'two', 'different', 'actresses', 'play', 'same', 'role', 'Conchita', 'first', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'twin', 'double-cross', 'films', 'where', 'two', 'girls', 'used', 'older', 'wealthy', 'man', 'money', 'was', 'wrong', 'Similar', 'title', 'film', 'film', 'passions', 'desires', 'emotion', 'obsession', 'reaction', 'man', 'can', 'have', 'someone', 'desperately', 'sexually', 'desires', 'Mathieu', 'possible', 'victim', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'have', 'flaws', 'troubles', 'do', 'provide', 'structured', 'characters', 'Mathieu', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'everything', 'woman', 'hardly', 'physically', 'attracted', 'hard', 'say', 'lust', 'dual', 'role', 'Conchita', 'film', 'used', 'two', 'purposes', 'first', 'distraction', 'second', 'emotion', 'Conchitas', 'are', 'different', 'own', 'way', 'are', 'used', 'push', 'forward', 'story', 'Whenever', 'Bunuel', 'needed', 'convey', 'different', 'emotion', 'would', 'bring', 'actress', 'best', 'represented', 'emotion', 'first', 'was', 'confusing', 'film', 'progressed', 'began', 'see', 'less', 'less', 'separate', 'actresses', 'instead', 'one', 'character', 'impressive', 'how', 'Bunuel', 'created', 'illusion.As', 'mentioned', 'above', 'were', 'two', 'devises', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'explained', 'use', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'female', 'role', 'second', 'bit', 'subtler', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'how', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'character', 'were', 'used', 'distract', 'pay', 'attention', 'film', 'terrorism', 'big', 'part', 'universe', 'surrounding', 'Mathieu', 'continually', 'Conchita', 'world', 'falling', 'apart', 'Bombings', 'deaths', 'are', 'time', 'high', 'yet', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'notice', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'Conchita', 'nothing', 'else', 'oblivious', 'surroundings', 'fact', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'are', 'also', 'oblivious', 'surroundings', 'Bunuel', 'job', 'keeping', 'eye', 'focused', 'interchanging', 'women', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'miss', 'actions', 'surrounding', 'film', 'believe', 'Bunuel', 'trying', 'prove', 'point', 'obsession', 'obscure', 'vision', 'eyes', 'forces', 'miss', 'crucial', 'elements', 'surroundings', ""n't"", 'end', 'when', 'are', 'reminded', 'violently', 'truth', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'felt', 'Bunuel', 'was', 'slapping', 'face', 'final', 'scene', 'had', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'terrorism', 'easily', 'reminded', 'me.This', 'was', 'spectacular', 'film', 'really', 'opened', 'eyes', 'completely', 'new', 'way', 'filmmaking', 'reminded', 'early', 'works', 'favorite', 'director', 'mine', 'Francois', 'Ozon', 'talented', 'artists', 'have', 'own', 'way', 'creating', 'world', 'emotion', 'do', 'most', 'beautiful', 'strokes', 'mechanical', 'brush', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'willing', 'experience', 'radical', 'yet', 'provocative', 'filmmaking', 'best', 'will', 'be', 'impressed.I', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'include', 'film', 'collection', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'Thanks', 'Criterion', 'have', 'provided', 'beautiful', 'packaging', 'obscure', 'film.Grade', '*****', '*****']",N/A

In his final surrealistic touch, Bunuel casts two women in the part of Conchita, a choice that has been interpreted a hundred different ways, though Bunuel himself insisted it was a random whimsical idea that just stuck. One thing on which everyone should agree, though, is that it adds to the mystery and ambiguity that is at the heart of Mathieu's relationship with Conchita. Had Bunuel made Mathieu consciously aware of this fact, it would've reduced it to a gimmick. This way, it preserves the obscurity of the title. I rank this movie as his best because he only got stronger as a filmmaker with time, and, this being his last one, it's informed by everything that came before. It's also wildly hilarious and very disturbing.

This is a movie about how sexual politics, specifically the chase of a woman, can consume a man's life, and how said sexual politics are, in the end, pointless in the context of the wider world.  And not only are they pointless, they can be abruptly ended BY the wider world.  In light of recent events, that's an excellent lesson to have around.Of course, this being a movie from the director who gave us &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot;, there are some...offbeat touches.  The role of Conchita is played by two actresses, a Frenchwoman and a Spaniard (slightly distracting at first, but once you know their faces, it fades.)  A dwarf shows up rather early on.

674148,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005QAPJ,Dennis Littrell,"[7, 7]","Carole Bouquet is the thinner Conchita who is somewhat severe.  Angela Molina is the one who dances and seems more natural.Jean-Claude Carriere wrote the script.  He may be the greatest screenwriter of all time.  He has over a hundred credits and some of them are among the best movies ever made.  Here's a brief list from those that I have seen: The Ogre (1996), Valmont (1989), The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988), The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), Diary of a Chambermaid (1964).There's some symbolism in Cet obscur objet du desir.  Sometimes Mathieu (Fernando Rey) carries around an old gunny sack.  We find out what's in it in the final scene.  It represents Conchita's virginity.  The terrorists in the background seem rather contemporary although this movie is from 1977.  Mathieu is rich and therefore represents the established European society.  Conchita and her friends represent the underclass.  Both Mathieu and Conchita are really character types.  He is the masher, the rake who is always working on a new conquest, although he is somewhat naive.  She is the tease who uses her wiles to get what she can from him.  Bunuel plays this ancient theme as a burlesque, exaggerating her coyness and his foolishness.  The ending may suggest that in some way he has won, or more likely that they are still at a standoff, even while the terrorists escalate the bombings.The question of why there are two actresses playing Conchita has more to do with Maria Schneider, who originally was cast in the role, but left because of the nudity or because Conchita's character was too contrary, than it has to do with any plot or symbolic necessity.  On the other hand, since she is that ""obscure object of desire"" (which really should be that ""unobtainable object of desire""), and because Bunuel wanted to emphasize that Mathieu's desire for her had nothing to do with her personally, he used two actresses and made it clear that Mathieu didn't notice the difference!  A bit of absurdity here, but Bunuel is comfortable with absurdity.All in all an interesting treatment of an ancient theme, but not one of Bunuel's best, even though it was his last at age 77.",4,No fool like an old fool,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,2173,"['Carole', 'Bouquet', 'thinner', 'Conchita', 'who', 'somewhat', 'severe', 'Angela', 'Molina', 'one', 'who', 'more', 'natural.Jean-Claude', 'Carriere', 'wrote', 'script', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'screenwriter', 'time', 'over', 'hundred', 'credits', 'are', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Here', 'brief', 'list', 'have', 'seen', 'Ogre', '1996', 'Valmont', '1989', 'Unbearable', 'Lightness', 'Being', '1988', 'Discreet', 'Charm', 'Bourgeoisie', '1972', 'Diary', 'Chambermaid', '1964', 'symbolism', 'Cet', 'obscur', 'objet', 'du', 'desir', 'Sometimes', 'Mathieu', 'Fernando', 'Rey', 'old', 'gunny', 'sack', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'final', 'scene', 'Conchita', 'virginity', 'terrorists', 'background', 'seem', 'rather', 'contemporary', 'movie', '1977', 'Mathieu', 'rich', 'therefore', 'established', 'European', 'society', 'Conchita', 'friends', 'represent', 'underclass', 'Mathieu', 'Conchita', 'are', 'really', 'character', 'types', 'masher', 'rake', 'who', 'always', 'working', 'new', 'conquest', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'tease', 'who', 'wiles', 'get', 'what', 'can', 'Bunuel', 'ancient', 'theme', 'burlesque', 'exaggerating', 'coyness', 'foolishness', 'ending', 'may', 'suggest', 'way', 'won', 'more', 'likely', 'are', 'still', 'standoff', 'even', 'terrorists', 'escalate', 'bombings.The', 'question', 'why', 'are', 'two', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Conchita', 'more', 'do', 'Maria', 'Schneider', 'who', 'originally', 'was', 'cast', 'role', 'left', 'nudity', 'Conchita', 'character', 'was', 'too', 'contrary', 'do', 'plot', 'symbolic', 'necessity', 'other', 'hand', 'obscure', 'object', 'desire', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'unobtainable', 'object', 'desire', 'Bunuel', 'wanted', 'emphasize', 'Mathieu', 'desire', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'personally', 'used', 'two', 'actresses', 'made', 'clear', 'Mathieu', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'difference', 'bit', 'absurdity', 'here', 'Bunuel', 'comfortable', 'absurdity.All', 'interesting', 'treatment', 'ancient', 'theme', 'not', 'one', 'Bunuel', 'best', 'even', 'was', 'last', 'age', '77']",N/A
674149,A3TIJC6L8USJ6Q,B00005QAPJ,Elderbear,"[18, 21]","A disturbing exageration and revelation of gender and power roles, this story is as true today as it was when penned over 100 years ago. It highlights the objectification that perverts love in capitalist society: while we see Conchita as the obvious (sex) object of Matthiu's desire, we are less conditioned to seeing Matthiu as the (success) object of Conchita's desire.Throughout the movie, Conchita's running hot/cold attitude does nothing but inflame Matthiu's desire to possess her. (This split nature is highlighted by having two separate actresses play her role--although not necessarily synchronized with her frigid/steamy responses.) His language in courting her speaks of possession, of ownership. Bunuel highlights this ultimate consequence of capitalist society, where people become transformed into commodities solely valued in their ability to fulfill the desires of another.Underlying the story of Matthieu and Conchita's complex relationship is a sense of the bizarre and of unexpected connections. Leftist and Rightist terrorist groups link up. A carjacking occurs outside the would-be lovers' window. A dwarf, who teaches private lessons in psychology joins Matthieu in his return trip to Paris, along with a judge who know's Matthieu's cousin.Matthieu, with his money and power, performing no useful task to society, stands out as a parasite. But Conchita, who only wants to dance, takes Matthieu's money, and is, in her own way, a parasite as well. Her mother, who only attends church, yet is willing to accept money for her daughter, is a parasite whose only contribution to society is to pray for the soul of her late husband.Eric Fromm has contrasted capitalism and socialism with the following distinction: Capitalism values objects over people, while socialism values people over objects. This masterpiece of Bunuel demonstrates that when objects become more valuable than people, people themselves become objects. Love gives way to the exchange of services for objects, and violence, as a form of redress, inevitably follows.(If you'd like to discuss this video or review in more depth, please click on the ""about me"" link above and drop me an email.

The novel has been adapted to the screen eight times, and among the films are Josef Von Sternberg's ""The Devil Is a Woman"" with Marlene Dietrich, Julien Duvivier's ""La Femme et le Pantin"" with Brigitte Bardot, and The Woman and the Puppet (1920) directed by Reginald Barker with Geraldine Farrar, American opera star from the Metropolitan Opera (1906-1922), one of the great beauties of her day, as well as one of the great voices of all time. It is not surprising that Luis Bunuel chose for his film the story of obsession, desire and all kinds of obstacles, including social, religious, and sexual that make it impossible to fulfill. All his films are explorations of the same theme, starting with the early ""L'ge d'or"". ""That obscure object of desire"" is a story of Mathieu, a middle age businessman (Fernando Rey who had given great performances in four Bunuel's films), and a young woman named Conchita -- played by two different actresses (French serene beauty Carole Bouquet and Spanish sensual &Aacute;ngela Molina) -- who alternately captivates and torments him. The director described his film as a ""story of impossibility to own a woman's body"". Luis Bu&ntilde;uel claims that there were neither a reason nor an explanation for using two actresses for the same role, he just felt that it would be right: ""I don't know why it should be two. It was automatic"" (from the DVD interview). When asked, what the obscure object of desire is, Buunuel answered: ""I don't know."" I think it is the best answer. How could the obscure object of desire be described or defined? Bunuel was able to recreate in the movie the atmosphere of danger, uncertainly and insecurity.

In Aphrodite's mind the idea of a perpetual relationship and marrioage, simply don't exist.Gea represents the woman who thinks in the marriage as a commitment of life. She loves the family and kids, and that's her bliss.That's why our troubled man (Fernando Rey) can not understand. Because he loves the best of both , and so his confussion grows and grows till the time comes for him to fade in that unexpected ending.One powerful of the couple.

The only complaint I have is with the ending.  The relationship between the two leading characters isn't clarified enough.Is the young woman sincere in her affection for her older man?  Yes.  No.  Yes.  Definitely not, she's just playing him for what she can get, and is in love with a younger man.  No wait, yes she loves him.  Wait, hold on, why is she walking away?The older man is annoying, an odd hero in that we don't want him to get what he wants, we want him to fail, because he is rich, stuck up, without redeeming social value.The young girl tells him that he knows nothing about women.  It seems that what she really wants is to be dominated and smacked.  But no, maybe that's not what she wants.  Well, yes, it seems that is what she wants.Interspersed in all this comic ambiguity, we are treated to random acts of terrorism.  Blooey!  Another rich pig dead.  When will it be our hero's turn to be the dead rich pig?  At the end of the movie, maybe?  He sure is made uncomfortable by the reports of terrorism.  It seems that terrorism is the natural reaction, by the mobilized lower class, to the entrenched and despicable upper class.This film is very French.

In this, his last film, he captures the related themes of obsessive desire, frustration, and immaturity perfectly, crafting a wicked black comedy.  When a wealthy middle-aged man, played to perfection by Fernando Rey, is entranced by a young girl he has recently hired as one of the maids in his grand mansion, he pursues her obsessively.The girl is played by two different actresses; here Bunuel is slyly saying to the audience, This man is too (two) distracted, too (two) obsessed.  The girl alternately leads him on and crushes his hopes, time after time, yet still the man returns to be alternately entranced and crushed.  His actions are ultimately revealed to be far too immature--if nothing else, based on the behavior of the girl--for his age, but he can't help himself.Simultaneously, a guerilla group plants bombs and blows things up all over the city of Paris where the film is set.  The immature need for immediate results, intensified by repeated frustration--typified by both the guerillas and the desperate man--is nowhere revealed in film as dramatically as in That Obscure Object of Desire.  The film ends with the convergence of these two entities (the guerillas and the man) in a perfect climax.The &quot;message&quot;?  Not only that you can't always get what you want; more to the point, here is what people do all over the world:  want things they don't understand, fail to understand what they want.Highly recommended.

And while it's obviously a Bunuel film, it's probably a good thing that it was his last. It contains all the hallmarks of Bunuel, but without the compelling qualities that made his earlier work some of the best filmmaking ever.At the opening, Mathieu (Fernando Rey) is boarding a train. He stops to pour a bucket of water over the head of a young woman. His fellow passengers naturally wonder about all this, so he tells them the tale of his courtship of Conchita (played by two actresses, Carole Bouquet and Angela Molina), which is, in essence, a tale of never-ending frustration, as the couple's every attempt to make love is thwarted, either by one of them or by some outside force. Bunuel fans will not be unfamiliar with this ruse (it's the same fate as the dinner party in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie), or many of the trappings surrounding it. Yet still, it lacks something.The most interesting part of the DVD is in the extras, which compare Bunuel's versions to the second adaptation of the novel, La Femme et le Pantin (Jacues de Baroncelli, 1928). One only wonders for a moment why they chose the particular scenes for the comparison they did, especially the climactic fight; suffice to say without giving anything away that Bunuel makes a few changes to the characters' attitudes that give the climax a whole different tone.I only with I could find the complete 1928 version to compare. (I have had the novel on my TBR stack for eight years, time to read it.) It is possible that those who've never seen another of Bunuel's late-period films will find this far more amusing than I did. I, however, am stuck comparing it to The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, one of the finest films not only from the Bunuel collection but by any director, and in that light, That Obscure Object of Desire was a pretty, amusing trifle. ** ",3,"Amusing, but not nearly The Discreet Charm",1072051200,"12 22, 2003",2003,2097,"['Obscure', 'Object', 'Desire', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', '1977', 'Obscure', 'Object', 'Desire', 'sixth', 'adaptation', 'Pierre', 'Louys', 'novel', 'Le', 'Femme', 'et', 'le', 'Pantin', 'come', 'screen', 'was', 'seventh', 'released', '1990', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'Bunuel', 'final', 'film', 'obviously', 'Bunuel', 'film', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'last', 'hallmarks', 'Bunuel', 'compelling', 'qualities', 'made', 'earlier', 'work', 'best', 'filmmaking', 'opening', 'Mathieu', 'Fernando', 'Rey', 'boarding', 'train', 'pour', 'bucket', 'water', 'head', 'young', 'woman', 'fellow', 'passengers', 'naturally', 'wonder', 'tale', 'courtship', 'Conchita', 'played', 'two', 'actresses', 'Carole', 'Bouquet', 'Angela', 'Molina', 'essence', 'tale', 'never-ending', 'frustration', 'couple', 'attempt', 'make', 'love', 'thwarted', 'either', 'one', 'outside', 'force', 'Bunuel', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'unfamiliar', 'ruse', 'same', 'fate', 'dinner', 'party', 'Discreet', 'Charm', 'Bourgeoisie', 'many', 'trappings', 'surrounding', 'still', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'DVD', 'extras', 'compare', 'Bunuel', 'versions', 'second', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'La', 'Femme', 'et', 'le', 'Pantin', 'Jacues', 'de', 'Baroncelli', '1928', 'One', 'only', 'wonders', 'moment', 'why', 'chose', 'particular', 'scenes', 'comparison', 'did', 'especially', 'climactic', 'fight', 'suffice', 'say', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'Bunuel', 'few', 'changes', 'characters', 'attitudes', 'give', 'climax', 'whole', 'different', 'tone.I', 'only', 'could', 'find', 'complete', '1928', 'version', 'compare', 'have', 'had', 'novel', 'TBR', 'stack', 'eight', 'years', 'time', 'read', 'possible', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Bunuel', 'late-period', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'far', 'more', 'amusing', 'did', 'however', 'am', 'stuck', 'comparing', 'Discreet', 'Charm', 'Bourgeoisie', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'not', 'only', 'Bunuel', 'collection', 'director', 'light', 'Obscure', 'Object', 'Desire', 'was', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'trifle', '**']",N/A

I applaud the efforts on the part of all concerned to make a sensitive, mature, *serious* movie.But that being said, if one were to hold this movie up to the standard of a ""serious"" movie, for me anyway, it lacks a great deal.Let's start with the plot.  Here's a guy Fernando Rey, a great actor, no question about that, but what's he doing in the movie?  He's infatuated with a woman age 18; meanwhile, he has to be at least 50 years old.  And she's ""leading him on,"" in scene after scene.  What's the point, what's the signifigance of this?  He's p-whipped and she's a c-teaser.Put anoteher way: how does this movie speak to the human condition?  At times it's downright silly.  He pours a bucket of water over her ans she pours a bucket of water over him. ... Funny?  I guess; but is this supposed to be a comedyort are we to take the movie seriously?The ending, too, is slightly ridiculous.  They both die in a terrorist bombing.  But what does terrorism have to do with this movie?  We see scenes of terrorists gunning down people in the street, but nowhere in the plot is it explained how these acts of terrorism relate to the two main characters: the p-whipped rich guy and the c-teaser girlfriend.I don't git it.  And I am a high school grad-u-ate.This movie is highly praised by professional film critics, so I watched the movie with high hopes and great expectations.  It is for this reason that I gave it only 3 stars.  I was disappointed.  That's not to say that compared to most movies, as previously noted, at least this movie contains an inherent intelligence and matureity, sadly missing in most of what we see in films today.",3,I Was Disappointed.,1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,1768,"[""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'movie', ""n't"", 'light-years', 'better', 'most', 'crap', 'being', 'produced', 'mainstream', 'filmmakers', 'applaud', 'efforts', 'part', 'concerned', 'make', 'sensitive', 'mature', '*serious*', 'movie.But', 'being', 'said', 'one', 'were', 'hold', 'movie', 'up', 'standard', 'serious', 'movie', 'anyway', 'great', 'deal.Let', 'start', 'plot', 'Here', 'guy', 'Fernando', 'Rey', 'great', 'actor', 'question', 'what', 'doing', 'movie', 'infatuated', 'woman', 'age', '18', 'meanwhile', 'be', 'least', '50', 'years', 'old', 'leading', 'scene', 'scene', 'What', 'point', 'what', 'signifigance', 'p-whipped', 'c-teaser.Put', 'anoteher', 'way', 'how', 'movie', 'speak', 'human', 'condition', 'times', 'downright', 'silly', 'bucket', 'water', 'ans', 'bucket', 'water', 'Funny', 'guess', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedyort', 'are', 'take', 'movie', 'seriously', 'ending', 'too', 'slightly', 'ridiculous', 'die', 'terrorist', 'bombing', 'what', 'terrorism', 'have', 'do', 'movie', 'see', 'scenes', 'terrorists', 'gunning', 'down', 'people', 'street', 'nowhere', 'plot', 'explained', 'how', 'acts', 'terrorism', 'relate', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'p-whipped', 'rich', 'guy', 'c-teaser', 'girlfriend.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'git', 'am', 'high', 'school', 'grad-u-ate.This', 'movie', 'highly', 'praised', 'professional', 'film', 'critics', 'watched', 'movie', 'high', 'hopes', 'great', 'expectations', 'reason', 'gave', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'was', 'disappointed', 'not', 'say', 'compared', 'most', 'movies', 'previously', 'noted', 'least', 'movie', 'inherent', 'intelligence', 'matureity', 'sadly', 'missing', 'most', 'what', 'see', 'films', 'today']",N/A
