850888,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0002YCVY2,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[8, 8]","For several seasons, Home Series shone like a rare gem at the start of the Sunday-night Adult Swim lineup on Cartoon Network.  The star of the series, sometimes neurotic 8-year old Brendon Small, spends most of his time writing and directing movies in his basement with his two best friends, Jason and Melissa.  These young characters provide each episode with a combination of innocence and comedy, offering a subtle humor rarely found in an animated sitcom (although King of the Hill has had some success in this area as well).  However, it is the ability of Home Movies to be both earnest and bizarre at the same time that made it such a perfect fit with such other off-the-wall Adult Swim features as Sealab 2120 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force.Alas, Comedy Central has since made the unwise decision to relegate Home Movies to an obscure early A.M. slot, a time much too late for those of us actually able to appreciate the show's intelligent, nuanced humor.  Luckily, though, we have the DVD releases to sustain us, starting here with Season One.  Although some people might not appreciate the Squigglevision style used for the first season (similar to another former Comedy Central hit, Dr. Katz), the brilliance of the show was manifest from the very start.  The very first episode highlights two of the series' most memorable characters:  Brendon's Mom, Paula, quite neurotic in her own right, and his soccer coach, Coach John McGuirk, a man who readily embraces his shortcomings (including his excessive alcohol use).  And in addition to the characters, there are the movies--always the movies!  In just one episode (Director's Cut), we see Brendon's visionary ""Louie, Louie,"" about a fictional meeting between Louis Pasteur and Louis Braille (because they're both French, of course!) as well as a rock opera based on the life of Franz Kafka and written by Duane, the teenager who supplies the music for Brendon's films.This 3-DVD set also contains a variety of extra features.  Several of the episodes offer a bonus commentary option (which basically means the actors talking through the entire episode rather than commenting on it per se).  There are also interviews with the creators (who, as you might expect, are rather bizarre themselves) as well as animation galleries plus other short animated features they've developed.  Finally, some of the episodes feature animatics, a sort of episode-in-progress where you see rough sketched loosely paired with dialogue but nowhere near final form.  Overall, this is a wonderful animated series, and I highly recommend that both old and new fans start their Home Movies DVD collection with this first season.",5,The gem of the Adult Swim lineup!,1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,2661,"['several', 'seasons', 'Home', 'Series', 'shone', 'rare', 'gem', 'start', 'Sunday-night', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'lineup', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'star', 'series', 'sometimes', 'neurotic', '8-year', 'old', 'Brendon', 'Small', 'most', 'time', 'writing', 'directing', 'movies', 'basement', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Jason', 'Melissa', 'young', 'characters', 'provide', 'episode', 'combination', 'innocence', 'comedy', 'offering', 'subtle', 'humor', 'rarely', 'found', 'animated', 'sitcom', 'King', 'Hill', 'had', 'success', 'area', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'ability', 'Home', 'Movies', 'be', 'earnest', 'bizarre', 'same', 'time', 'made', 'perfect', 'fit', 'such', 'other', 'off-the-wall', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'Sealab', '2120', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'Hunger', 'Force.Alas', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'made', 'unwise', 'decision', 'relegate', 'Home', 'Movies', 'obscure', 'early', 'A.M.', 'slot', 'time', 'much', 'too', 'late', 'actually', 'able', 'appreciate', 'show', 'intelligent', 'nuanced', 'humor', 'Luckily', 'though', 'have', 'DVD', 'sustain', 'starting', 'here', 'Season', 'One', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'appreciate', 'Squigglevision', 'style', 'used', 'first', 'season', 'similar', 'former', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'hit', 'Dr.', 'Katz', 'brilliance', 'show', 'was', 'manifest', 'very', 'start', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'highlights', 'two', 'series', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Brendon', 'Mom', 'Paula', 'quite', 'neurotic', 'own', 'right', 'soccer', 'coach', 'Coach', 'John', 'McGuirk', 'man', 'who', 'readily', 'shortcomings', 'including', 'excessive', 'alcohol', 'use', 'addition', 'characters', 'are', 'movies', 'always', 'movies', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'Director', 'Cut', 'see', 'Brendon', 'visionary', 'Louie', 'Louie', 'fictional', 'meeting', 'Louis', 'Pasteur', 'Louis', 'Braille', ""'re"", 'French', 'course', 'as', 'well', 'rock', 'opera', 'based', 'life', 'Franz', 'Kafka', 'written', 'Duane', 'teenager', 'who', 'music', 'Brendon', 'films.This', '3-DVD', 'set', 'also', 'variety', 'extra', 'features', 'Several', 'episodes', 'offer', 'bonus', 'commentary', 'option', 'basically', 'actors', 'talking', 'entire', 'episode', 'rather', 'commenting', 'se', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'creators', 'who', 'might', 'expect', 'are', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'as', 'well', 'animation', 'galleries', 'other', 'short', 'animated', 'features', ""'ve"", 'developed', 'Finally', 'episodes', 'feature', 'animatics', 'sort', 'episode-in-progress', 'where', 'see', 'rough', 'sketched', 'loosely', 'paired', 'dialogue', 'nowhere', 'final', 'form', 'Overall', 'wonderful', 'animated', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend', 'old', 'new', 'fans', 'start', 'Home', 'Movies', 'DVD', 'collection', 'first', 'season']",Home Movies - Season One
850889,A18QA3A3UYWFU9,B0002YCVY2,Blade,"[81, 96]","Finally, one of the funniest shows (next to ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"", ""Futurama"", & ""Family Guy"") is getting the DVD treatment it deserves! This is the COMPLETE first season of ""Home Movies"" and although it only consists of thirteen episodes, it's still enough to leave satisfaction. The humor can also be a little mediocre, but the crude animation and the funny voices make up for that (Jason's voice especially) and it NEVER fails to entertain even the average Adult Swim fan! The episodes are as follows:STAY AWAY FROM MY MOM: Coach McGurk starts dating Brendon's mom, and Brendon is not too happy about it. OVERALL: 4/5 the first episode that started it all and you can tell because the voices are just developing.I DON'T DO WELL IN PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES: Paula (Brendon's mom) hesitates to attend a parent-teacher conferance for Brendon, considering he hasn't done any homework for the past year. OVERALL: 4/5 Pretty funny! The scene where Brendon shows his school project by communicating with himself on television is just hilarious!THE ART OF THE SUCKER PUNCH: After Jason is jumped by the school bully, Shannon, Brendon decides to exact revenge by fighting him. One of my favorite episodes! OVERALL: 5/5 One of my favorite episodes. VERY funny!BRENDON GETS RABIES: Brendon has to watch the neighbor's cat while they're on vacation. But when the cat escapes, Brendon and friends, Jason & Melissa must try and find it. OVERALL: 5/5 Another favorite! I'll never forget Jason's line, ""When you lose something, don't go and find it. Because if you do, it has rabies."" Priceless!WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE TUESDAY: The cute girl in school, Lonnie takes a liking to Brendon and the two start dating. However, Lonnie becomes a burden for both Jason and Melissa whenever they use her in their movies and tries to convince Brendon to lose her. OVERALL: 3/5 Kind of weak and kind of sad. To be honest I do NOT like Lonnie's character (she's pretty damn annoying and stupid in my opinion!) And I'm GLAD they barely used her in further episodes.DIRECTOR'S CUT: Duene writes a rock opera based on the life of Franz Kafka. Jason and Melissa choose to work on that project instead of Brendon's idea for a film called, ""Louis Louis"". Eventually, all four of them agree (including Duene) to make two cuts. One for Brendon and the other for Duene. Meanwhile, McGurk becomes jealous of the new soccer coach, Drew. In order to get rid of him, McGurk tries to frame Drew for vandalism but fails. OVERALL: 5/5. Who can forget the scene with Brendon and Melissa during the filming of ""Louis Louis""? Brendon says, ""Instead of using instruments for music, we'll do it with our mouths. Like, dum-diddly-dum-dum-dum!"" LOL!IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY: Melissa convinces Brendon to make a movie tribute for her grandfather, considering that his Birthday is coming up. But after Brendon mistakingly makes fun of him in the movie, Melissa is angered and almost everything Brendon tries to do to make it up to her fails... Well, maybe another tribute will do? OVERALL: 5/5 I laugh every time I see Brendon move Melissa's grandfather's mouth along with the words, ""I'm a little teapot short and stooooout!""METHOD OF ACTING: While Paula begins teaching a creative writing class, Brendon tries out for a town play. But after getting in, he quickly gets kicked out due to his bossy/picky attitude. However, Brendon decides to convince the director to let him back in by showing a tape of him acting. OVERALL: 4/5 Not bad. Seeing Brendon's character in a drag while singing, ""I'm a pretty lady!"" is just hysterical!LIFE THROUGH A FISH EYE LENS: Brendon and friends try and get a fish eye lens for an upcoming movie, but Paula is on a budget. Knowing this, Brendon decides to save up some money himself by working in numerous jobs: a paper boy, a janitor at the ice cream shop, and working at Erik's (Melissa's father) Real Estate business. Meanwhile, Coach McGurk plans to toughen the team up in order to beat an old mentor in the next game. OVERALL: 5/5 I love this one A LOT! I can't get enough of the scene where Paula decides to take the kids out for ice cream. KIDS: Three cheers for Brendon's mom! Three cheers for Brendon's mom! Three cheers for Brendon's mom"" PAULA: No, seriously, kids! Stop it or I'll drop you off at the next corner! LMAO!!!!SCHOOL NURSE: Brendon wants out of school and tries to fake an illness so he can go home. Meanwhile, Jason has a crush on the sexy school nurse and tries to hook up with her. OVERALL: 5/5 Extremely funny! I like the scene where Jason attacks Coach McGurk by biting his leg while screaming, ""I'LL KILL YOU!"" lol!MORTGAGES AND MARBLES: After Brendon's baby sister, Josie sticks marbles in her nose, Brendon decides to make a video on teaching little kids not to put marbles in their nose. Unfortunately, the lesson fails. Elsewhere, Coach McGurk makes plans with Erik to buy a new house but doesn't seem to have the luck. OVERALL: 5/5. My third favorite episode of Season One. Who can't resist the crazy Spikey McMarbles puppet used in Brendon's movie?LAW & BOARDER: After Brendon gets hit by a car while riding his bike, he is wrongfully accused and punished by writing an essay on why what he did was illegal. Brendon decides to do a video essay instead of a paper essay in order to prove what REALLY happened and to claim his innocence. Meanwhile, Paula's old friend, Stephanie comes to town and stays with them for awhile due to her own problems back at home. OVERALL: 3/5 Another weak episode that's not as funny due to the fact that I thought it was unfair and stupid that Brendon got in trouble while Paula had to pay for the car damages. I mean, WTF?!! The people that hit him were obviously rich anyways so I don't see why they couldn't pay for it! Also, the judge in this episode is a complete [ass] at times. Nevertheless, it did have SOME funny moments! The way Brendon, Jason and Melissa filmed his video essay as a renactment of Brendon getting hit by the car was cheesy but in a funny way! MELISSA: Yeah, we should run over some children! JASON: Yeah, let's kill children!AWARDS AND ANGER: After winning first place at the local Film Festival, Brendon, Melissa, and Jason meet up with Channel 1 news who wants to do a documentary on them. Unfortunately, the outcome doesn't work as Brendon and friends expected. Elsewhere, Coach McGurk has to enter an anger management course due to his anger problem. OVERALL: 5/5 My last (but not least) favorite for Season One! Jason is damn funny when he says, ""Sometimes cats come in the sandbox and poop"" ROTFL!Anyways, there's many other funny quotes and parts in each episode that I haven't listed. I give the whole show altogether a 10/10! It's one of the best shows I've seen and I wish they hadn't taken it off the air after four seasons because it's a good comedy! Well, I'm glad they're deciding to put all the seasons out on DVD. The First Season however is the first and ONLY season in squigglevision (where the outlines on the characters move) I think this release will be worth it and I reccomend it to

He comes to an unspoken agreement with Duane and isolates himself from Melissa & Jason in the process.

Brendon decides to take the whole project in a new director, dressing him up in make-up and a dress.  She's not impressed, and neither is Erik, or at least so he pretends.  He thinks it's hilarious, but Melissa won't budge, so Brendon redoes the project and wins back her friendship.(The Art of the Sucker Punch)-Jason gets thrown into the mud by neighborhood bully, and recurring character, Shannon.  Brendon decides to avenge his friend, who brings it all upon himself 'cus he's ""all like duuurrhhhr"".  Brendon soon realizes that you can't choreograph a real life fight and Shannon lets go of his ego for a while in order to help Brendon feel better about himself.",5,The birth of Cartoon Network's/Adult Swim's greatest show,1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,1471,"['Home', 'Movies', 'began', 'UPN', 'few', 'episodes', 'tanked', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'picked', 'up.So', 'apparently', 'god.The', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'season', 'used', 'squiggle', 'vision', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'why', 'folks', 'were', 'turned', 'off', 'show', 'maybe', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'missed', 'out', 'big', 'time.Classic', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'Director', 'Cut', '-Duane', 'do', 'musical', 'german', 'writer', 'Franz', 'Kafka', '[', 'maybe', 'reason', 'why', 'episode', 'one', 'favorites', ']', 'Brendon', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'unspoken', 'agreement', 'Duane', 'Melissa', 'Jason', 'process', 'course', 'mended', 'hilarity', 'enfolds', 'Was', 'Supposed', 'be', 'Funny', '-Eric', 'Melissa', 'dad', 'Brendon', 'make', 'video', 'father', 'Melissa', 'grandfather', 'Brendon', 'take', 'whole', 'project', 'new', 'director', 'dressing', 'up', 'make-up', 'dress', 'not', 'impressed', 'Erik', 'least', 'so', 'hilarious', 'Melissa', 'wo', ""n't"", 'budge', 'Brendon', 'project', 'back', 'friendship', 'Art', 'Sucker', 'Punch', '-Jason', 'thrown', 'mud', 'neighborhood', 'bully', 'recurring', 'character', 'Shannon', 'Brendon', 'avenge', 'friend', 'who', 'like', 'duuurrhhhr', 'Brendon', 'soon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'choreograph', 'real', 'life', 'fight', 'Shannon', 'lets', 'go', 'ego', 'while', 'order', 'help', 'Brendon', 'feel', 'better']",Home Movies - Season One

Or rather, you love or hate the various offerings in this Cartoon Network ""adult"" time block. Someone wrote that this show is mostly ""kid safe."" That's a real concern for parents. When Adult Swim first began airing, it began with a rather strong dislaimer, summed up with ""all kids out of the pool."" However, to CN's credit, the shows were far more innocent than what you'd find on Fox, Comedy Central or the networks (and far more witty). That went downhill when Family Guy became the standard instead of Space Ghost Coast to Coast and Matt H. started writing the unfunny blurbs in between shows (which had been rather innocent and very funny before).I originally hated Home Movies for reasons other reviewers have amply detailed. But a friend said, ""Give it a chance."" I did, and it became my favorite cartoon in the Adult Swim block. Why? It's like radio. You could turn off the picture and the deadpan humor, perfectly voiced, would still come across. But it's even better with Brendan's gestures (and non-gestures). Homer Simpson introduced the long, blank stare and slack jawed drool ""dooooughnuuuuuuts."" Ren and Stimpy introduced long periods of time with the characters doing nothing, both of which echo ""real life"" far more than the constant ""action"" of earlier cartoons. The best part of this show is when the characters make movies (as the title suggests) dressing up, playing parts and arguing over the scripts, which echoes the longtime Hollywood convention of making movies about making movies or stage shows. This metafictional multilevelled approach adds richness and allows the whole show to relax. Once more, the advances have come in the area of animation and not live action TV, most of which settles for recycled jokes and ever more ""extreme"" read: ""adult"" humor.Cartoon Network has proven you don't have to be dirty to be funny (anyone can write a dirty joke; try writing a clean one), and that kids' TV doesn't have to be boring and bland. It's a given that the best writers today are all on the side of animation (people who hate animation don't know what they're missing). Look how bad Disney's live action movies are compared to their witty cartoon shows, and the same goes for studios across the board, who daily demonstrate how much more creativity is possible within limits and under restraint, as comics and animators had to work under in previous decades.Whether this show is kid-friendly depends on the standards you apply (it's certainly not as bad as soap operas, news or Family Guy). However, the Third Season opens with an ad for a Shout! Factory video game which I find needlessly violent (the company finds it humorous).

What the other reviewers haven't said is, unlike most of the shows on Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim,"" Home Movies is usually free of obscenity and while it often features mature subject matter, it is always handled cleverly and usually via high-minded innuendo.  The only exceptions I can think of-and this happened during a showing I gave to some friends who had kids present, much to my embarrassment-was a scene in which Coach McGuirk describes telling his landlady to ""kiss my a**,"" and in another scene asks a divorced father ""how long they were doing it"" behind his back.

Interspersed with that was the first season of Home Movies.  I was immediately taken in by the sharp, snarky dialogue as well as the crudity of the animation with its jangled lines and shimmering presentation.  As with South Park, it's easy to get past that as you begin to listen and follow the story arcs.  Brendon Small makes his home movies as a precocious 8 year old, employing his friends Melissa, and Jason.  My favorite character of course is soccer-non-coach John McGurk who spouts forth knuckle dragging philosophy and pontificates with Brendan as his charges run about the field without any concept of or game plan.  Seeing McGurk with the kids is a riot, but it's when he interacts with adults that things go up a notch and his shortcomings become painfully aware; like attempting to use a fax machine, or coffee maker, trying to come to grips with the concept of a mortgage, mooning his landlady and moving out of his apt. before he has secured another, and his anger management techniques.  Jason too to a lesser extent is a supporting cast gem, always picking, flicking, or having some thing running from his nose he tirelessly and thanklessly throws himself into Brendon's productions.  The rest of the characters in the world serve excellently to buoy the stories, and they do a wonderful job, particularly Brendon's mom who is supposed to hold it all together and does so by the edge of her fingernails.

A lot of new Adult Swim shows just play on extreme left field comedy, totally lack character depth, storyline, plot, and even good or new animation. Home Movies was a really rare series because it was so funny while being dreadfully honest and wild at the same time. Its just sad to see a good program like Adult Swim go under too, I think when Cowboy Bebop went out of the picture it lost some charm too. There are still some funny shows such as Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Venture Brothers can be funny sometimes, The Boondocks is another really good one particularly season 3, and some of season 2. Though some new additions like King Of The Hill, American Dad are kinda stale and boring, and the horrible Tim and Eric show and Delocated are just down right stupid. However, when you watch Home Movies you are reminded that creative minds can still make great humor and entertainment.",5,"Brandon, get me a beer!",1292371200,"12 15, 2010",2010,1664,"['Coach', 'McGuirk', 'would', 'say', 'get', 'ready', 'laugh', 'skin', 'off', 'drunk', 'sober', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'hit', 'TV', 'am', 'known', 'being', 'guy', 'call', 'TV', 'being', 'destroyer', 'new', 'generation', 'Brandon', 'Small', 'creative', 'sensitive', 'sometimes', 'insecure', 'young', 'dude', 'who', 'trying', 'work', 'craft', 'art', 'movies', 'course', 'band', 'friends', 'help', 'out', 'build', 'sets', 'castles', 'cardboard', 'using', 'washer', 'machines', 'buildings', 'great', 'show', 'lot', 'respects', 'had', 'very', 'unique', 'sense', 'humor', 'characters', 'could', 'relate', 'lot', 'different', 'levels', 'yet', 'were', 'still', 'silly', 'funny', 'Most', 'TV', 'days', 'particularly', 'adult', 'swim', 'are', 'lack', 'dimensions', 'show', 'had', 'A', 'lot', 'new', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'just', 'play', 'extreme', 'left', 'field', 'comedy', 'totally', 'lack', 'character', 'depth', 'storyline', 'plot', 'even', 'good', 'new', 'animation', 'Home', 'Movies', 'was', 'really', 'rare', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'being', 'dreadfully', 'honest', 'wild', 'same', 'time', 'just', 'sad', 'see', 'good', 'program', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'go', 'too', 'think', 'when', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'went', 'picture', 'lost', 'charm', 'too', 'are', 'still', 'funny', 'shows', 'such', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'Hunger', 'Force', 'Venture', 'Brothers', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'Boondocks', 'really', 'good', 'one', 'particularly', 'season', '3', 'season', '2', 'new', 'additions', 'King', 'Hill', 'American', 'Dad', 'are', 'kinda', 'stale', 'boring', 'horrible', 'Tim', 'Eric', 'show', 'Delocated', 'are', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'stupid', 'However', 'when', 'watch', 'Home', 'Movies', 'are', 'reminded', 'creative', 'minds', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'great', 'humor', 'entertainment']",Home Movies - Season One

Every Sunday and Thursday they would run this show, I watched it and it grew on me. Season One is one of the best seasons featuring some of the most hilarious outtakes from the the gang. ""Brendan Gets Rabies"", ""Law and Borders"", ""Art of the Sucker Punch"", and  ""Through a Fish Eye Lens"" are some of my immediate favorites, but after watching any episode a number of times all of them could become my favorites.Another great aspect of home movies are the cool musical numbers placed in some of the eps performed by the dim-witted Duane and his band Scab. For instance in ""Law and Borders"", Brendon is sentenced to write an essay explaining to the judge how he was sorry for causing the accident he was involved in. Instead the kids decide to make a hilarious, dramatized spoof of the accident and then the kids rock out at the end: ""Don't hit children don't run them over, let them live their lives let them get older!x2 Brendon's cool, he didn't break the rules, he was just riding his bike, they tried to take his life!""

It was originally aired on UPN and was cancelled after this first season. The truth is that Home Movies belonged to a special niche and the people in charge of the Adult Swim made the brilliant decision to pick Home Movies up and give the show the chance it deserved... and they haven't made a decision that good since.Home Movies was one of the few shows on the Adult Swim one can honestly say was smart enough to actually be for adults. The situations, the characters and their backgrounds, and the socially-advanced way these 8 year olds communicate with each other, and the child-like way they approached life is what makes Home Movies the gem it is.The loose dialogue and seemingly unrehearsed improv the characters perform gives the show a unique feel of maturity, especially in this first season. One could say that in the first season the characters and their conversations are almost too adult (in an intellectual sense). In later seasons the dialogue seems less improvised; more structured and scripted, but still holds its comic edge.What costs Home Movie Season 1 a star in my review is this little thing known as ""Squigglevision"". Those of us familiar with shows like Dr. Katz or ""Ed, Edd and Eddy"" will know what squigglevision is. It is a very annoying method of animation where all the lines ""squiggle"" to give the art a more hand-drawn look as if each frame was done by hand and then animated. It bothers me, but it doesn't take away from the shows humor which is what makes Home Movies what it is and is not used beyond season 1.Since the cancellation of Home Movies the Adult Swim block has fallen into a quagmire of dumb shows that use what I like to call ""random comedy"". In other words shows that tell no story, but simply have left-field events take place with no core or anything for me to relate to. Their new shows--- such as ""Squidbillies"" and ""Tom Goes to the Mayor""--- demonstrates how shows like Home Movies made Adult Swim Comedy the perfect Sunday night treat that it once was (for me), and now how badly Adult Swim's creative people need rehab (in my opinion).Thanks to Soup 2 Nuts, Brendon Small and Loren Bouchard for giving me such a warm and intelligent comedy program. I wish it had another 5 seasons, but the Home Movies DVDs will become a beloved addition to my DVD library. I hope this review helped a little, and many thanks for taking the time to read my worthless opinion.Adult Swim still has the Venture Brothers, Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law- still some of the best comedy on TV, but it hasn't gotten better than ""Home Movies"" for me, and after seeing the random direction Adult Swim seems to be taking their comedy block, I strongly doubt it ever will.",4,The best 30 minutes the Adult Swim ever had,1100563200,"11 16, 2004",2004,2869,"['fandom', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'block', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'began', 'underrated', 'ingenious', 'Home', 'Movies', 'ended', 'departure', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'UPN', 'was', 'cancelled', 'first', 'season', 'truth', 'Home', 'Movies', 'belonged', 'special', 'niche', 'people', 'charge', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'made', 'brilliant', 'decision', 'pick', 'Home', 'Movies', 'up', 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'deserved', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'decision', 'good', 'since.Home', 'Movies', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'one', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'actually', 'be', 'adults', 'situations', 'characters', 'backgrounds', 'socially-advanced', 'way', '8', 'year', 'olds', 'communicate', 'other', 'child-like', 'way', 'approached', 'life', 'what', 'Home', 'Movies', 'gem', 'loose', 'dialogue', 'seemingly', 'unrehearsed', 'improv', 'characters', 'perform', 'show', 'unique', 'feel', 'maturity', 'especially', 'first', 'season', 'One', 'could', 'say', 'first', 'season', 'characters', 'conversations', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'adult', 'intellectual', 'sense', 'later', 'seasons', 'dialogue', 'less', 'improvised', 'more', 'structured', 'scripted', 'still', 'comic', 'edge.What', 'Home', 'Movie', 'Season', '1', 'star', 'review', 'little', 'thing', 'known', 'Squigglevision', 'familiar', 'shows', 'Dr.', 'Katz', 'Ed', 'Edd', 'Eddy', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'squigglevision', 'very', 'annoying', 'method', 'animation', 'where', 'lines', 'squiggle', 'give', 'art', 'more', 'hand-drawn', 'look', 'frame', 'was', 'done', 'hand', 'then', 'animated', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'shows', 'humor', 'what', 'Home', 'Movies', 'what', 'not', 'used', 'season', '1.Since', 'cancellation', 'Home', 'Movies', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'block', 'fallen', 'quagmire', 'dumb', 'shows', 'use', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'random', 'comedy', 'other', 'words', 'tell', 'story', 'simply', 'have', 'left-field', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'core', 'anything', 'relate', 'new', 'shows', 'such', 'Squidbillies', 'Tom', 'Goes', 'Mayor', 'how', 'shows', 'Home', 'Movies', 'made', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'Comedy', 'perfect', 'Sunday', 'night', 'treat', 'once', 'was', 'now', 'how', 'badly', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'creative', 'people', 'need', 'rehab', 'opinion', 'Soup', '2', 'Nuts', 'Brendon', 'Small', 'Loren', 'Bouchard', 'giving', 'such', 'warm', 'intelligent', 'comedy', 'program', 'wish', 'had', '5', 'seasons', 'Home', 'Movies', 'DVDs', 'will', 'become', 'beloved', 'addition', 'DVD', 'library', 'hope', 'review', 'helped', 'little', 'many', 'thanks', 'taking', 'time', 'read', 'worthless', 'opinion.Adult', 'Swim', 'still', 'Venture', 'Brothers', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'Hunger', 'Force', 'Harvey', 'Birdman', 'Attorney', 'Law-', 'still', 'best', 'comedy', 'TV', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'better', 'Home', 'Movies', 'seeing', 'random', 'direction', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'be', 'taking', 'comedy', 'block', 'strongly', 'doubt', 'ever', 'will']",Home Movies - Season One

The budget was very small, so they did their best and produced a fun show.Coach McGerk has since gone on to transform into Bob of &#34;Bob's Burgers,&#34; so he isn't portraying an overblown, pathetic, irritating character anymore, something he was good at in this series.Brendon Small, who plays the main character of the same name in this series, has since gone on to make &#34;Metalacalypse,&#34; which I don't care for at all.Lots of extras on this and following seasons of &#34;Home Movies&#34;.

850918,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B0002YCVY2,Theo,"[2, 3]","As usual with a DVD release, there are really two things to review here: the show itself and the extras. Well, this is one of those very rare times where full marks are deserved on both counts!I'm guessing that most people reading this review will have seen ""Home Movies"" before. I think it was one of the shows in the original adult swim programming block on Cartoon Network way back when. But... Just on the off-chance that you're not already a fan, let's start with a review of the show.Home Movies is a comedy built around a group of three children who - using improvised sets, homemade costumes, and a camcorder - make their very own ""movies"". Meanwhile, their actual lives, and the lives of the adults around them, go on. Generally speaking, the events in their movies parallel or juxtapose against events in an often very adult real world. In fact, even the children themselves seem to spend a fair bit bit of time thinking and acting a lot like grown-ups. However, there are also times when they are very much as real children are in their powerlessness in the face of the adult world.Overall, the show has an aesthetic far closer to mundane realism than anything else I've seen on Cartoon Network - for children or adults. The characters inhabit essentially the same world we do, and face the same constraints. The children around whom the show is centered are supposed to be eight and nine years of age, and they never do anything fundamentally beyond the powers of real eight and nine year olds - even if at times they do stretch the boundries of belief just a tad.The result is a show that's not only both funny and captivating; it's a show that offers us a view of childhood and of life in general that balances pure whimsy with a very, very dry and occasionally quite dark wit. As another reviewer has already commented, this show does have a real warmth to it; although I myself would hasten to add that it is never, ever merely sentimental. The result is that rarest of all beasts: a genuinely intelligent piece of television. So much so that I'm astonished they got to make a full four seasons. Most shows this smart can barely make it to one before someone pulls the plug.On top of all this, the extras we get in this DVD are among the best I've ever seen. The commentaries and interviews are certainly simple, low-budget affairs, but they honestly leave you feeling like you've been taken backstage to get to know the makers of the show personally. So much so in fact that if ever I happened to see one of them on the street, I think I'd actually have to make a conscious effort to remind myself not to behave like some crazy stalker guy who truly believes that these people are my real life best friends.What more could any fanboy ask?Theo.",5,"Great Show, Awesome Extras",1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,2760,"['usual', 'DVD', 'release', 'are', 'really', 'two', 'things', 'review', 'here', 'show', 'extras', 'Well', 'one', 'very', 'rare', 'times', 'where', 'full', 'marks', 'are', 'deserved', 'counts', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'most', 'people', 'reading', 'review', 'will', 'have', 'seen', 'Home', 'Movies', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'shows', 'original', 'adult', 'swim', 'programming', 'block', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'Just', 'off-chance', ""'re"", 'not', 'already', 'fan', 'let', 'start', 'review', 'show.Home', 'Movies', 'comedy', 'built', 'group', 'three', 'children', 'who', 'using', 'improvised', 'sets', 'homemade', 'costumes', 'camcorder', 'make', 'very', 'own', 'movies', 'Meanwhile', 'actual', 'lives', 'lives', 'adults', 'go', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'events', 'movies', 'parallel', 'juxtapose', 'events', 'often', 'very', 'adult', 'real', 'world', 'fact', 'even', 'children', 'seem', 'spend', 'fair', 'bit', 'bit', 'time', 'thinking', 'acting', 'lot', 'grown-ups', 'However', 'are', 'also', 'times', 'when', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'real', 'children', 'are', 'powerlessness', 'face', 'adult', 'world.Overall', 'show', 'aesthetic', 'far', 'closer', 'mundane', 'realism', 'anything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'children', 'adults', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'essentially', 'same', 'world', 'do', 'face', 'same', 'constraints', 'children', 'whom', 'show', 'centered', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'eight', 'nine', 'years', 'age', 'never', 'do', 'anything', 'fundamentally', 'powers', 'real', 'eight', 'nine', 'year', 'olds', 'even', 'times', 'do', 'stretch', 'boundries', 'belief', 'just', 'tad.The', 'result', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'captivating', 'show', 'view', 'childhood', 'life', 'general', 'pure', 'whimsy', 'very', 'very', 'dry', 'occasionally', 'quite', 'dark', 'wit', 'reviewer', 'already', 'commented', 'show', 'have', 'real', 'warmth', 'would', 'hasten', 'add', 'never', 'ever', 'merely', 'sentimental', 'result', 'rarest', 'beasts', 'genuinely', 'intelligent', 'piece', 'television', 'So', 'much', ""'m"", 'astonished', 'got', 'make', 'full', 'four', 'seasons', 'Most', 'shows', 'smart', 'can', 'barely', 'make', 'one', 'someone', 'plug.On', 'top', 'extras', 'get', 'DVD', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'commentaries', 'interviews', 'are', 'certainly', 'simple', 'low-budget', 'affairs', 'honestly', 'leave', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taken', 'backstage', 'get', 'know', 'makers', 'show', 'personally', 'So', 'much', 'fact', 'ever', 'happened', 'see', 'one', 'street', 'think', ""'d"", 'actually', 'have', 'make', 'conscious', 'effort', 'remind', 'not', 'behave', 'crazy', 'stalker', 'guy', 'who', 'truly', 'people', 'are', 'real', 'life', 'best', 'friends.What', 'more', 'could', 'fanboy', 'ask', 'Theo']",Home Movies - Season One
