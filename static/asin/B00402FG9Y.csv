These are the Bridge at Remagen,Beachhead and Mosquito Squadron. I didn't think too much of Ambush Bay,whichseemed to have no story line-other than killing off the group one at a time-untilnearly the very end.

Beach Red was not one I liked when it came out, and I did not like it again. Never understood what the director was trying to do. Did not work for me. Rest are B movies.

1378622,A2CPV4078RYYS1,B00402FG9Y,Wandering1,"[3, 5]","My biggest complaint about this compilation is the mastering/transfer of the films.The Movies in this pack that are Widescreen are Widescreen in Full screen format (except for 633 Squadron).Let me clarify that.The Movies that are in WS format are still in WS format, but instead of automatically going to WS mode on your TV they go to Full Screen mode - thus you have Black (blank) on the top, bottom, and both sides.To get the full WS mode as it should be to fill your screen you have to zoom the picture, which of course loses a fair amount of detail and doesn't look as good as it should.633 Squadron is the only WS in this pack that does it correctly.As for the Movies in this pack:The Bridge at Remagen is the best of the bunch, this is a good one.Beach Red is just kind of odd, not really like any other War Movie out there, and it's not terribly good either.Beachhead has Tony Curtis and is an okay flick, though not stellar.Ambush Bay with Mickey Rooney (yes Mickey Rooney), is fair, but . . . well, it's a bit difficult for me to take M.R. as a tough Sgt. in War Movie - this is just not his genre.Mosquito Squadron / 633 Squadron - I grouped these two together because they are almost interchangeable.In fact, there are several scenes that are absolutely the exact same film footage frame for frame in both pictures.I would actually give this two and a half stars.The first Movie and the number of Movies for the price are the saving points for this package.",3,Slightly below average War Movie fare with poor editing/transfer,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,1468,"['biggest', 'complaint', 'compilation', 'mastering/transfer', 'films.The', 'Movies', 'pack', 'are', 'Widescreen', 'are', 'Widescreen', 'Full', 'screen', 'format', '633', 'Squadron', '.Let', 'clarify', 'that.The', 'Movies', 'are', 'WS', 'format', 'are', 'still', 'WS', 'format', 'instead', 'automatically', 'going', 'WS', 'mode', 'TV', 'go', 'Full', 'Screen', 'mode', 'thus', 'have', 'Black', 'blank', 'top', 'bottom', 'sides.To', 'get', 'full', 'WS', 'mode', 'should', 'be', 'fill', 'screen', 'have', 'zoom', 'picture', 'course', 'fair', 'amount', 'detail', ""n't"", 'look', 'as', 'good', 'Squadron', 'only', 'WS', 'pack', 'correctly.As', 'Movies', 'pack', 'Bridge', 'Remagen', 'best', 'bunch', 'good', 'one.Beach', 'Red', 'just', 'kind', 'odd', 'not', 'really', 'other', 'War', 'Movie', 'there', 'not', 'terribly', 'good', 'either.Beachhead', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'okay', 'flick', 'not', 'stellar.Ambush', 'Bay', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'yes', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'fair', 'well', 'bit', 'difficult', 'take', 'M.R', 'tough', 'Sgt', 'War', 'Movie', 'just', 'not', 'genre.Mosquito', 'Squadron', '633', 'Squadron', 'grouped', 'two', 'together', 'are', 'almost', 'interchangeable.In', 'fact', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'exact', 'same', 'film', 'footage', 'frame', 'frame', 'pictures.I', 'would', 'actually', 'give', 'two', 'half', 'stars.The', 'first', 'Movie', 'number', 'Movies', 'price', 'are', 'saving', 'points', 'package']",MGM Movie Collection - 6 War Films: (The Bridge at Remagen / Beach Red / Beachhead / Ambush Bay / Mosquito Squadron / and more)
