1057867,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000NO1XMC,Brian E. Erland,"[6, 6]","As one would expect from a Hollywood feature film from the fifties ('55 to be exact) `White Feather' suffers from the usual maladies: stiff and somewhat unrealistic dialogue, a lot of dramatic posturing for effect purposes and the always disconcerting visual of white actors playing the role of Native Americans. However that is an unchangeable sign of that generation and if you're a fan of early films you've learned to accept the stylist difference and enjoy the many other aspects of a good film.`White Feather' doesn't contain the numerous sequences that usually accompany a film categorized within the Western genre. The film is by in large a tale (according to the narration in the prologue and epilogue a factual story) of romance between two people from different cultures, one white (Robert Wagner as Josh Tanner) and one Native American (Debra Paget as Appearing Day). The backdrop of this love story concerns the impending signing of a peace treaty between the Cheyenne and the white usurpers that would displace the Native Americans from their rightful homeland and requires them to move south to less than greener pastures.What this film lacks in fast paced action is more than made up for in overall strong performances by the entire cast and a surprisingly sensitive and poignant depiction of the plight of the Native American and the code of honor that the warrior lives by.With all that said let me also admit that I've had a crush on Debra Paget as long as I can remember so any film she appears in will more likely than not get a higher rating then it would have otherwise. However in this case I think I would have recommended this one even in her absence.",4,"""It Was A Good Game"" ~ Friendship, Love And Honor Amongst The Cheyenne",1215216000,"07 5, 2008",2008,1677,"['one', 'would', 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'film', 'fifties', ""'55"", 'be', 'exact', 'White', 'Feather', 'suffers', 'usual', 'maladies', 'stiff', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'dialogue', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'posturing', 'effect', 'purposes', 'always', 'disconcerting', 'visual', 'white', 'actors', 'playing', 'role', 'Native', 'Americans', 'However', 'unchangeable', 'sign', 'generation', ""'re"", 'fan', 'early', 'films', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'accept', 'stylist', 'difference', 'enjoy', 'many', 'other', 'aspects', 'good', 'film.', 'White', 'Feather', ""n't"", 'contain', 'numerous', 'sequences', 'usually', 'accompany', 'film', 'categorized', 'Western', 'genre', 'film', 'large', 'tale', 'according', 'narration', 'prologue', 'epilogue', 'factual', 'story', 'romance', 'two', 'people', 'different', 'cultures', 'one', 'white', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'Josh', 'Tanner', 'one', 'Native', 'American', 'Debra', 'Paget', 'Appearing', 'Day', 'backdrop', 'love', 'story', 'concerns', 'impending', 'signing', 'peace', 'treaty', 'Cheyenne', 'white', 'usurpers', 'would', 'displace', 'Native', 'Americans', 'rightful', 'homeland', 'move', 'south', 'less', 'greener', 'film', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'overall', 'strong', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'surprisingly', 'sensitive', 'poignant', 'depiction', 'plight', 'Native', 'American', 'code', 'honor', 'warrior', 'lives', 'by.With', 'said', 'let', 'also', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'had', 'crush', 'Debra', 'Paget', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'so', 'film', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'not', 'get', 'higher', 'rating', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'However', 'case', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'recommended', 'one', 'even', 'absence']",White Feather

1057869,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B000NO1XMC,Chrijeff,"[2, 2]","In 1877, the Indian tribes of the Northern Plains have been invited to a great council at Fort Laramie.  The Sioux, Blackfoot, Crow, and Arapaho have responded and are negotiating, but the Cheyenne, led by Chief Broken Hand (Eduard Franz), are holding out, staying on their side of the river but killing any white person who dares to cross it--as at least one hopeful prospector does.  His body is found by Josh Tanner (Robert Wagner), a young surveyor hired by a group of businessmen who hope to establish a city in the land the Indians will give up.  Tanner's father was a trader and he knows the Indians well, but, he says, has ""no feelings"" for them, either of sympathy or of enmity.  Unexpectedly he encounters Broken Hand's son Little Dog (Jeffrey Hunter) and his friend American Horse (Hugh O'Brian) and so impresses them by his steadiness and courage that they invite him to their village as a guest.  In this process he meets Little Dog's sister Appearing Day (Debra Paget, who had played a similar part five years earlier inBroken Arrow), and love blooms, turning Tanner's sympathies definitely in a red direction.  But when Broken Hand decides that his people must sign the offered treaty, Little Dog balks, and tragedy appears inevitable.Though Tanner in his opening narration says that the story ""actually happened,"" history has been rather seriously mangled: quite apart from the fact that not a word is said of the Custer incident of 1876, there was no Laramie council in 1877, and of the tribes mentioned, only the Cheyennes were forced to leave their own lands and go south--the Sioux, Blackfoot, Crow, and northern Arapaho all remained in the north, although the Arapaho ended up sharing a reservation with their traditional enemies the Shoshoni.  There are also a couple of rather important errors in the portrayal of Cheyenne custom, most notably when Broken Hand shoots one of his own young men for ""dishonoring his people before the white men""--among the Cheyenne, as most other tribes, murder within the group was a very serious crime and very rare.  On the other hand, there's a certain beauty and gravity about the movie that makes it more than a pale shadow of Jimmy Stewart'sBroken Arrow, and as in the latter the Indians, even though played by whites, are sympathetically portrayed.  If you can accept the notion that perhaps all this is going on in an alternate universe, the solemn tragedy of the story, lightened a bit by Tanner and Appearing Day's romance, is genuinely affecting, and there's a good leaven of Indian pageantry, action, and suspense besides.  Watch for Milburn Stone (Doc Adams of ""Gunsmoke"") as a peace commissioner and Western stalwart Noah Beery, Jr., as a Cavalry lieutenant.",4,Love and threatened war,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,2727,"['1877', 'Indian', 'tribes', 'Northern', 'Plains', 'have', 'been', 'invited', 'great', 'council', 'Fort', 'Laramie', 'Sioux', 'Blackfoot', 'Crow', 'Arapaho', 'have', 'responded', 'are', 'negotiating', 'Cheyenne', 'led', 'Chief', 'Broken', 'Hand', 'Eduard', 'Franz', 'are', 'holding', 'out', 'staying', 'side', 'river', 'killing', 'white', 'person', 'who', 'cross', 'least', 'one', 'hopeful', 'prospector', 'body', 'found', 'Josh', 'Tanner', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'young', 'surveyor', 'hired', 'group', 'businessmen', 'who', 'hope', 'establish', 'city', 'land', 'Indians', 'will', 'give', 'up', 'Tanner', 'father', 'was', 'trader', 'Indians', 'well', 'feelings', 'either', 'sympathy', 'enmity', 'Unexpectedly', 'Broken', 'Hand', 'son', 'Little', 'Dog', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'friend', 'American', 'Horse', 'Hugh', ""O'Brian"", 'so', 'impresses', 'steadiness', 'courage', 'invite', 'village', 'guest', 'process', 'Little', 'Dog', 'sister', 'Appearing', 'Day', 'Debra', 'Paget', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'similar', 'part', 'five', 'years', 'earlier', 'inBroken', 'Arrow', 'love', 'blooms', 'turning', 'Tanner', 'sympathies', 'definitely', 'red', 'direction', 'when', 'Broken', 'Hand', 'people', 'must', 'sign', 'offered', 'treaty', 'Little', 'Dog', 'balks', 'tragedy', 'inevitable.Though', 'Tanner', 'opening', 'narration', 'story', 'actually', 'happened', 'history', 'been', 'rather', 'seriously', 'mangled', 'quite', 'apart', 'fact', 'not', 'word', 'said', 'Custer', 'incident', '1876', 'was', 'Laramie', 'council', '1877', 'tribes', 'mentioned', 'only', 'Cheyennes', 'were', 'forced', 'leave', 'own', 'lands', 'go', 'south', 'Sioux', 'Blackfoot', 'Crow', 'northern', 'Arapaho', 'remained', 'north', 'Arapaho', 'ended', 'up', 'sharing', 'reservation', 'traditional', 'enemies', 'Shoshoni', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'rather', 'important', 'errors', 'portrayal', 'Cheyenne', 'custom', 'most', 'notably', 'when', 'Broken', 'Hand', 'shoots', 'one', 'own', 'young', 'men', 'dishonoring', 'people', 'white', 'men', 'Cheyenne', 'most', 'other', 'tribes', 'murder', 'group', 'was', 'very', 'serious', 'crime', 'very', 'rare', 'other', 'hand', 'certain', 'beauty', 'gravity', 'movie', 'more', 'pale', 'shadow', 'Jimmy', ""Stewart'sBroken"", 'Arrow', 'latter', 'Indians', 'even', 'played', 'whites', 'are', 'sympathetically', 'portrayed', 'can', 'accept', 'notion', 'perhaps', 'going', 'alternate', 'universe', 'solemn', 'tragedy', 'story', 'lightened', 'bit', 'Tanner', 'Appearing', 'Day', 'romance', 'genuinely', 'affecting', 'good', 'leaven', 'Indian', 'pageantry', 'action', 'suspense', 'besides', 'Watch', 'Milburn', 'Stone', 'Doc', 'Adams', 'Gunsmoke', 'peace', 'commissioner', 'Western', 'stalwart', 'Noah', 'Beery', 'Jr.', 'Cavalry', 'lieutenant']",White Feather

John Lund is suitably sympathetic as the army officer.  The main roles are played well by a cast at the start of their careers.  Jeffery Hunter is especially noteworthy as Little Dog.  I recommend this movie to everyone - and even to those who do not enjoy westerns.

1057874,A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG,B000NO1XMC,Kay's Husband,"[3, 3]","This movie is excellent entertainment for its time and also for today, however, it is not excellent history. But what the movie attempts to show deserves some sympathetic historical consideration.Robert Wagner mentions the date 1877 at movie's beginning, only a few months after the Custer fight of June, 1876, at the Little Big Horn. After that fight, the Lakota as well as Northern Cheyenne were later tracked and attacked by General Ranald Mackenzie's troops either to die in battle or suffer much in way of starvation and death during the winter of 1876. Were driven after the battle to accept charity from Crazy Horse's Oglala people to live through the winter of '76. The old, normal life of the Northern Cheyenne had ceased to exit.We are to assume the spring of 1877, for that is when the Northern Cheyenne were compelled to sign a treaty which would take them south away from their traditional home to Oklahoma then known as Indian Territory.  The Northern Cheyenne walked every mile, close to 1500 miles, from the Powder River country to their new home near Fort Reno at the Darlington Agency. The journey on foot had taken several months from spring to fall, 1877. From that fall, 1877, until following spring, 1878, they remained in Oklahoma, but found conditions there so impossible they were forced into a choice of facing death at Darlington or death on the trail back to Montana. They chose to return to the Powder River country. That subject too Hollywood also put on film in 1964 as CHEYENNE AUTUMN.Many may not enjoy this film, taking exception to major or minor elements, but for the attempt made to offer some pictorial history of this 1877 turbulent time, the movie does deserve several stars. The acting is very good, the filming is also good, but the story it attempts to tell is even better. Whether Hollywood or viewers were aware, it was a brave venture, none-the-less even today. The Northern Cheyenne did finally receive some tribute for both their bravery and suffering.Though I see glaring historical errors in this film, it is still one of the more intelligent films made in the 1950s on the Northern plains Lakota tribes. Many may not feel that way, but then many do not read the real history of those long ago times. And though the movie has its inaccuracies, in the main it is a story well told. The shadows of both Little Wolf (Little Coyote) and Dull Knife (Morning Star) under examination continue to stand tall, though both died pretty much forgotten even to their own people.Semper Fi.",5,1877 HOLLYWOOD STYLE,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,2525,"['movie', 'excellent', 'entertainment', 'time', 'also', 'today', 'however', 'not', 'excellent', 'history', 'what', 'movie', 'show', 'sympathetic', 'historical', 'consideration.Robert', 'Wagner', 'date', '1877', 'movie', 'beginning', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'Custer', 'fight', 'June', '1876', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'fight', 'Lakota', 'as', 'well', 'Northern', 'Cheyenne', 'were', 'later', 'tracked', 'attacked', 'General', 'Ranald', 'Mackenzie', 'troops', 'die', 'battle', 'suffer', 'much', 'way', 'starvation', 'death', 'winter', '1876', 'Were', 'driven', 'battle', 'accept', 'charity', 'Crazy', 'Horse', 'Oglala', 'people', 'live', 'winter', ""'76"", 'old', 'normal', 'life', 'Northern', 'Cheyenne', 'had', 'ceased', 'exit.We', 'are', 'assume', 'spring', '1877', 'when', 'Northern', 'Cheyenne', 'were', 'compelled', 'sign', 'treaty', 'would', 'take', 'south', 'away', 'traditional', 'home', 'Oklahoma', 'then', 'known', 'Indian', 'Territory', 'Northern', 'Cheyenne', 'walked', 'mile', 'close', '1500', 'miles', 'Powder', 'River', 'country', 'new', 'home', 'Fort', 'Reno', 'Darlington', 'Agency', 'journey', 'foot', 'had', 'taken', 'several', 'months', 'spring', 'fall', '1877', 'fall', '1877', 'following', 'spring', '1878', 'remained', 'Oklahoma', 'found', 'conditions', 'there', 'so', 'impossible', 'were', 'forced', 'choice', 'facing', 'death', 'Darlington', 'death', 'trail', 'back', 'Montana', 'chose', 'return', 'Powder', 'River', 'country', 'subject', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'put', 'film', '1964', 'CHEYENNE', 'AUTUMN.Many', 'may', 'not', 'enjoy', 'film', 'taking', 'exception', 'major', 'minor', 'elements', 'attempt', 'made', 'offer', 'pictorial', 'history', '1877', 'turbulent', 'time', 'movie', 'deserve', 'several', 'stars', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'filming', 'also', 'good', 'story', 'tell', 'even', 'better', 'Whether', 'Hollywood', 'viewers', 'were', 'aware', 'was', 'brave', 'venture', 'none-the-less', 'even', 'today', 'Northern', 'Cheyenne', 'did', 'finally', 'receive', 'tribute', 'bravery', 'suffering.Though', 'see', 'glaring', 'historical', 'errors', 'film', 'still', 'one', 'more', 'intelligent', 'films', 'made', '1950s', 'Northern', 'Lakota', 'tribes', 'Many', 'may', 'not', 'feel', 'way', 'then', 'many', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'real', 'history', 'long', 'ago', 'times', 'movie', 'inaccuracies', 'main', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'shadows', 'Little', 'Wolf', 'Little', 'Coyote', 'Dull', 'Knife', 'Morning', 'Star', 'examination', 'continue', 'stand', 'tall', 'died', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgotten', 'even', 'own', 'people.Semper', 'Fi']",White Feather
1057875,AO4CIKY7Q1REK,B000NO1XMC,"L. B. Godin ""lgodin5""","[11, 19]","I got White Feather last Thursday and I've been watching it once, even twice a day since. I saw this movie on television in 1977 and never thought I'd ever seen it again. Thirty years later, it's still very powerful. I must admit that the very beginning where Little Dog(Jeffrey Hunter)and his party are watching surveyor Josh Tanner(Robert Wagner) taking care of the killed miner I couldn't help but grin at Jeffrey Hunter's delivery of his lines. But then remembering he had broadcasting training he had to project his voice a little bit more dramatically. My favorite scenes I like to watch over and over is the scene where Little Dog and his party intercept Josh Tanner and Anne with Tanner being so bold as to pluck a feather out of the testy Little Dog's hair and  awarding Little Dog a fold out comb. I was just as fascinated with it as Little Dog because I, too, have never seen such a comb, and of course the dramatic death scene at the end. Gradually did Josh Tanner grow to love Appearing Day(Debra Paget)Little Dog's sister. Paget by the way played an Apache maiden courted by Jimmy Stewart in ""Broken Arrow"", whose music appears in a few scenes of White Feather which I wasn't too thrilled with. Little Dog's build up to his dramatic end gives me goose pimples no matter how often I play it back, especially with his shrill war cries that make my spine tingle.I enjoyed Little Dog's humor about the stolen Crow horse and why Tanner shouldn't ride alone busting the myth that Indians have no humor.I'm still touched no matter how many times I play Little Dog addressing his friend, Josh Tanner, before the soldiers by saying amongst other things:""I will not go with the soldiers. I will die here..."" busting the myth that every Indian went quietly, bending mindlessly to the will of the white man. What I found annoying with the movie are blatantly bad stunt double work such as the scene where Crow are chasing after the Cheyenne, Jeff Hunter falls off riding backwards and we hear him war cry for help, we see him staring at a Crow going after him, then we plainly see another man pull the Crow off his horse by yanking his lance, then we see Jeff again popping on the horse. Did the studio think the audience too daft to notice a different man? Did they think a sharp-eyed watcher wouldn't notice during the fort rescue scene where Little Dog must rescue American Horse another man is plainly shown jumping down to the fort ground after scaling the wall, hide behind a tree, only to see Jeff Hunter pop out? It's insulting that studios then and now think audiences too stupid to notice when an actor is being replaced by a stunt 'double' who doesn't even barely look like the actor he's replacing. Some people actually *do* notice for those few seconds because they're actually paying attention not mindlessly watching. I thought movies are supposed to have people in charge of continuity. White Feather's continuity problems were sloppily obvious.Little Dog's sister,Appearing Day, would be wearing one color of braid ties and then a second later in the same scene they'd be a different color. After  Little Dog's first confrontation with Josh Tanner and Anne, and Tanner leaves, American Horse shifts his horse and a second later he's shown not moving from his spot as if the two scenes were hastily spliced together. Little Dog first confronts Josh Tanner and Anne, you notice his hair ribbons, he introduces himself, they disappear, he watches Josh and Anne leave and his hair ribbons miraculously reappear. When Little Dog examines Josh Tanner and Anne, his loincloth's longer back is first draped over his horse, then he's sitting on it and he didn't even shift his weight and near the end when Little Dog and American Horse get ready to confront the soldiers and they were putting on their ornaments, both forgot their lances leaning against a rock and Little Dog left his war chief feathered bonnet on its rock.What's the point of bringing all that extra gear when all you're going to really use is your carbine? Did the studio think no one would notice? Then there's Josh Tanner first being seen riding a buckskin, then a much lighter fort buckskin horse as he's crossing the river after his Cheyenne dinner date. Why on earth was he given a lighter buckskin  when his first buckskin was good enough? Then he rides the black Crow horse the rest of the movie. He changed horses more often than Appearing Day changed her braid ties, and people who know horses notice subtle color changes of their coats especially if they're the same breed. The continuity director didn't see these blatant mistakes because they didn't think anyone would notice. Since we're informed that the characters actually existed, one would think the real American Horse and Little Dog wouldn't have been caught dead wearing body paint that made them look like they were scribbled on by a studio hired kindergartner. Without meaning to White Feather also shows some comedy like the scene of Little Dog and his warriors  practicing their battle skills. Look closely on both screen versions through the haze of dust, two prop men, one in a white shirt, madly running around collecting fallen arrows, seeing the Crow warriors chasing Josh Tanner and seeing their lance-armed leader in all his bravado and shouting not realizing he's thrusting a backwards lance. I suppose someone told him because the next second the Crow had wised up and displays his lance blade properly facing front, the exodus scene where an old lady passes with a cradleboard and she's supporting it with her left hand that has a wedding ring, or the scene where Little Dog is with his warriors just after Josh Tanner leaves Anne to award Little Dog his comb. On the letterbox version, as Little Dog speaks, you can see one of his warriors at the far right, fumbling to put his bow back in its case on his back.I'm appalled by the DVD's back jacket synopsis:""In an effort to peacefully coexist with white settlers the Cheyenne tribe agrees to resettle, sacrificing valued Wyoming hunting grounds to make way for gold prospecting. Led by Colonel Lindsey, the tribe's resettlement journey is also guided by a rugged land surveyor Josh Tanner and his Cheyenne tribesman friends-Little Dog and American Horse. But an attraction between Little Dog's fiancee(Debra Paget) and Tanner threatens to ruin the resettlement plans and the tribe sends an arrow with a white feather-a symbol of their intention to wage war!"" Obviously whomever wrote that didn't bother to watch the movie at all and should be spanked for making things up! The Cheyenne didn't give up their hunting grounds, they gave up *all* of their land because their neighbors the Sioux, Arapaho and Blackfeet agreed to leave. Cheyenne would be alone to fight the whites and as Chief Broken Hand said, their food supply in the buffalo herds had been drastically cut again and without food to sustain them, without their tribal allies helping them fight, the Cheyenne would have too many more young men die. The move was reluctant. Had he been young, Chief Broken Hand said he would've stayed to fight. The settlement journey wasn't guided by Tanner, Little Dog and American Horse. Tanner originally came to help build a town eventually and the fort was his stop over. He just got caught up in the mix, became friends with Little Dog and American Horse who admired his courage, and he fell in love with Chief Broken Hand's daughter, Appearing Day, which ticked American Horse off because she was his reluctant fiancee, not Little Dog's. Appearing Day was Little Dog's sister. Tanner's attraction to Appearing Day didn't threaten to ruin anything! The only thing that threatened to ruin the resettlement was Little Dog and American Horse who rightfully refused to be relocated. Lastly, the white feather wasn't attached to any arrow, but to one of the Bowie knives  Josh Tanner gave to Little Dog and American Horse.The white feather wasn't a symbol from the Cheyenne as a whole to wage war. It was a challenge from Little Dog and American Horse who prefered to fight the army single handedly. They weren't bound by the treaty giving up their land because they weren't in camp when it was signed. One who has never seen White Feather and read the innacurate DVD's synopsis wouldn't know the difference. Afterwards however, I have a feeling they'd be miffed at the blatant innacuracies because I assume they care. The DVD has some special features. You can select any scene and go on from there. You can select your languages from English or French or you can watch the entire movie in French and use the subtitles you need which are English, French or Spanish. The dubbing into French doesn't work well if you're a decent close up lip reader. There's an Interactive Pressbook gallery where, even though there are many articles, only some you can highlight and actually read. There are pictures and posters and an original theatrical trailer. One side you can see the original version of the movie which is letter box. At first I found it distracting until I watched the other side where you get a full screen version but characters have a tendency to be cut out of the picture. One has a tough decision to make. Watch the letter box version where characters look smaller on your monitor but you get everyone in, or put it on full screen and see everything bigger but have people reduced to  disembodied voices. On both versions however it starts off in letterbox then changes. If you want to see a decent Western with strong characterizations, Durango Mexico that looks convincingly like Wyoming, White Feather is a Cinemascope masterpiece without having to have John Wayne swaggering and blustering nearby to be watchable. This isn't a movie for fans of the late Jeffrey Hunter to overlook.",5,Cinemascope masterpiece,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,9809,"['got', 'White', 'Feather', 'last', 'Thursday', ""'ve"", 'been',

In fact, it co-stars Debra Paget who also played the hero's Native American love interest in BROKEN ARROW.Robert Wagner stars as Josh Tanner, a surveyor, sent to Fort Laramie to lay out a townsite, once a treaty has been signed with the Cheyenne.  After a couple of tense encounters, he becomes friends with Little Dog (Jeffrey Hunter), son of Chief Broken Hand (Eduard Franz), and American Horse (Hugh O'Brian), both of whom oppose any treaty with the whites.  He also falls in love with Appearing Day (Paget), who has been promised to American Horse.Once Broken Hand signs the treaty, both Little Dog and American Horse send a white feather to the military commander (John Lund) of the fort, challenging him to war.  It will be the two Cheyenne against the entire Army force, but if the military fires first, the entire tribe of Cheyenne may turn of them.According to the film, the son of the characters played by Wagner and Paget (i.e. Chief Broken Hand's grandson) would attend the military academy at West Point.Noah Beery, Jr. and Virginia Leith co-star in the movie.

Although the film falls into the cavalry-Indian category, the theme throughout was a peaceful relocation of the Cheyennes to another territory, presumably the Indian Territory of Oklahoma, thus allowing their homeland to be despoiled by prospectors and gold hunters. Robert Wagner stars as a surveyor who befriends the Cheyennes, which leads to a romantic union with Debra Paget who reenacts her role as an Indian maiden as she did in director Delmer Daves' classic western, ""Broken Arrow"".
