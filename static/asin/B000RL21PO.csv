1082334,A8DI0COTCMRDV,B000RL21PO,creatureart,"[4, 5]","Yes fellow horror fans ""We All Scream For Ice Cream"" is on the cheesy side of horror(although Forsythe is excellent as both good guy/bad guy versions of Buster the clown). The film is just littered with bad dialog oozing from the mouths of the other players, but when you mix it in with the creepy story and the goofy tongue & cheek way that buster kills off his victims you can't help but be reminded of another fun 80's clown flick loaded with cheese in ""Killer Clowns From Outer Space"". Speaking of the 80's, if this film was made back then it would have fit in perfect with the times and something tells me it would be one of those fun cult classic movies from the 80's that horror fans(like myself) would be eagerly waiting on it's dvd release.

1082335,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B000RL21PO,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","Residents of a small town are dropping like flies and the deaths are linked to the return of a former Ice Cream Vendor, a clown named Buster (William Forsythe). The problem is that Buster is dead and he has returned to seek vengeance on those who, years prior, played a cruel and fatal prank on him.Judging by the reviews, this episode from season 2 of ""Masters of Horror"" doesn't have many fans and although this is clearly not the best of the bunch, it was able to hold my attention and entertain me up until the lame climax.  Now I have to frankly state this is due largely because I read these negative reviews beforehand, therefore my expectations were firmly set low and what I got was better than what was expected. Gore hounds and hard-core fans of the series will most definitely be disappointed since this episode has no gore (unless the sight of melting ice cream makes you nauseous), no sex, no nudity and the film actually takes itself seriously (I was surprised the actors were able to keep a straight face while reciting their lines) and judging by the subject matter, that is a big no-no. Some of the quirkier past episodes of the series clearly played it for laughs and threw in some explicit gore for good measure unlike this installment. With that said, this film does have some creepy scenes and one heck of a villain. We should remember that horror doesn't necessarily mean buckets of blood and guts. If done well, a film can be scary without the gore. Ever since I saw ""Poltergeist"" as a child, I have been untrusting of clowns and this ghostly freak was a sight to behold and well played out by Forsythe. There are also some genuinely creepy scenes depicting Busters ghostly ice cream truck surrounded by frozen mist and ghostly whispers slowly traveling down the dark neighborhood streets and equally eerie are the scenes of hypnotized children clutching their change & waiting for Buster and his ice cream truck during the midnight hour. However I am not so sure the good out weighs the bad and the film makers had a lot of opportunities here to make an excellent ghost story featuring a character many children and adults are fearful of but somehow they were unable to pull it off successfully. This is a shame since the ghostly villian had so much potential. It's not a complete loss since this is one of the very few episodes of the MOH series you can watch with some of your older teens with the only questionable scene being the rather enjoyable demise of the town bully in his hot tub.""We All Scream for Ice Cream"" will not please those looking for a blood soaked thrill ride. If you can get past this and can put up with a silly tale of supernatural vengeance, a creepy killer and (for the most part) a chilling atmosphere, you may find this peculiar installment an entertaining watch.2.5 out of 5",3,Killer Klown from Inner Space,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,2829,"['Residents', 'small', 'town', 'are', 'dropping', 'flies', 'deaths', 'are', 'linked', 'return', 'former', 'Ice', 'Cream', 'Vendor', 'clown', 'named', 'Buster', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'problem', 'Buster', 'dead', 'returned', 'seek', 'vengeance', 'who', 'years', 'prior', 'played', 'cruel', 'fatal', 'prank', 'him.Judging', 'reviews', 'episode', 'season', '2', 'Masters', 'Horror', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'fans', 'clearly', 'not', 'best', 'bunch', 'was', 'able', 'hold', 'attention', 'entertain', 'up', 'lame', 'climax', 'Now', 'have', 'frankly', 'state', 'due', 'largely', 'read', 'negative', 'reviews', 'beforehand', 'therefore', 'expectations', 'were', 'firmly', 'set', 'low', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'better', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'Gore', 'hounds', 'hard-core', 'fans', 'series', 'will', 'most', 'definitely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'episode', 'gore', 'sight', 'melting', 'ice', 'cream', 'nauseous', 'sex', 'nudity', 'film', 'actually', 'seriously', 'was', 'surprised', 'actors', 'were', 'able', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'reciting', 'lines', 'judging', 'subject', 'matter', 'big', 'no-no', 'quirkier', 'episodes', 'series', 'clearly', 'played', 'laughs', 'threw', 'explicit', 'gore', 'good', 'measure', 'installment', 'said', 'film', 'have', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'one', 'heck', 'villain', 'should', 'remember', 'horror', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'buckets', 'blood', 'guts', 'done', 'well', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'scary', 'gore', 'Ever', 'saw', 'Poltergeist', 'child', 'have', 'been', 'untrusting', 'clowns', 'ghostly', 'freak', 'was', 'sight', 'behold', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'Forsythe', 'are', 'also', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'Busters', 'ghostly', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'surrounded', 'frozen', 'mist', 'ghostly', 'whispers', 'slowly', 'traveling', 'down', 'dark', 'neighborhood', 'streets', 'equally', 'eerie', 'are', 'scenes', 'hypnotized', 'children', 'clutching', 'change', 'waiting', 'Buster', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'midnight', 'hour', 'However', 'am', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'good', 'out', 'bad', 'film', 'makers', 'had', 'lot', 'opportunities', 'here', 'make', 'excellent', 'ghost', 'story', 'featuring', 'character', 'many', 'children', 'adults', 'are', 'fearful', 'somehow', 'were', 'unable', 'pull', 'off', 'successfully', 'shame', 'ghostly', 'villian', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'not', 'complete', 'loss', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'episodes', 'MOH', 'series', 'can', 'watch', 'older', 'teens', 'only', 'questionable', 'scene', 'being', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'demise', 'town', 'bully', 'hot', 'tub', 'Scream', 'Ice', 'Cream', 'will', 'not', 'please', 'looking', 'blood', 'soaked', 'thrill', 'ride', 'can', 'get', 'can', 'put', 'up', 'silly', 'tale', 'supernatural', 'vengeance', 'creepy', 'killer', 'most', 'part', 'chilling', 'atmosphere', 'may', 'find', 'peculiar', 'installment', 'entertaining', 'watch.2.5', '5']",We All Scream For Ice Cream

1082339,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B000RL21PO,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","We All Scream For Ice Cream is a cheesy revenge story that tells the tale of an ice cream clown man named Buster. Buster was a mentally challenged ice cream man who dressed as a clown and made weekly trips through the neighborhood in his Cheery Time Ice Cream Truck to entertain the kids and serve them ice cream. Unfortunately, Buster was loathed by the neighborhood bully, Virgil, who decided to get his friends to play a prank on Buster one day, which lead to the accidental death of Buster.A generation later, the young boys are now grown men with families but the crime of their past may be strolling close for their children. Buster and his ice cream truck have returned in the form of a vengeful spirit to get vengeance on those responsible for his death. Now in most horror clown movies, clowns have a dangerous weapon or some cool supernatural powers to attack their victims. Buster's weapon? Ice cream. Ridiculous right? I said the same thing. Every frozen treat will bring it's own taste of death.Now I'm a big fan of clown horror movies. I love evil clowns, I love clown horror movies but this may have to be an exception. This movie is very 80s cheesy like and almost seems like a sister film to the 1980s Killer Klowns From Outer Space film. Heck, when I first saw the cover for this, I thought it was made in the 80s or 90s. The producers of this movie try to mix horror and comedy at some points but unfortunately they don't do too well at it. The clown is not even scary! Horror movie clowns are supposed to be scary! He may pass off as being somewhat of a creep but even those who fear clowns would probably laugh in his face. Overall this is an okay movie but nothing special.

It all starts to fall into place when a group of the old crew, now a grown man, moves back into the neighborhood of his youth and brings his family back with him, discovering in the process that something else has returned and is bringing revenge with it.It was funny, to say the least.One of the flaws in the Masters of Horror series is that they rely on old stories, older storytellers, and on small budgets that would beguile the world of horror if they had to revolve on such strict guidelines. Some of them are intentional laughs, making the mind laugh and play, and some are too gimmicky and don't do the idea justice. We All Scream for Ice Cream could have been a lot better if it wouldn't have taken the gimmick too far, but the end product reminds me of something from the 80s when ""Stephen King adaptation"" all over it. Despite that I still thought that this part of the show was good, with the kids all seemingly hateful in their own ways. Equally as good were some of the campy special effects when revenge is taken; you have people turning into little blobettes because of revenge and the blobettes - they look pretty nasty. They were pretty funny, and the campiness of the movie reflects the turn that the series has taken.The problem is that the ending was a bit too long, the ""We all scream for ice cream"" mantra was a bit too unbridled for the brain to handle, and some of the motions seem forced and contrived. Of the adult actors only one of them was entertainingly bizarre, and the kids in the middle of the night seemed more like they were missing acting lessons than missing out on sleep.If only...If you want campy and maybe a small amount of creepy, then you might enjoy this. I can't say I didn't enjoy it myself at any level but I can say that this was more of a Sci-Fi channel film than a Masters of Horror outing. Perhaps that was the point of it, wanting to laugh a bit and mock the staples that tormented the genre for such a long time.
