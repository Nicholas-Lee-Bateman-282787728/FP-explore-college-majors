19972,A2NFTFQYW8GXIQ,0767832485,A. Andersen,"[5, 9]",Ralph Fiennes once again suffers in doomed passion - as he didin THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  This time he's thrown over for a reason thatmight have been a shocker in the fifties but comes as an unconvincing spiritual conviction at the turn of the milennium.  The Cinematography was Oscar nominated as was Julianne Moore's leading performance - neither deserved in my estimation.  The film is rather leaden and tacky looking - one wonders why anyone thought it would be interesting to today's audiences.  The one overlooked gem is Stephen Rea's supporting performance - he does a wonderful job making a bore actually appealing.,2,Boring romance with a twist ending.,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,620,"['Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'once', 'again', 'suffers', 'doomed', 'passion', 'ENGLISH', 'PATIENT', 'time', 'thrown', 'reason', 'thatmight', 'have', 'been', 'shocker', 'fifties', 'unconvincing', 'spiritual', 'conviction', 'turn', 'milennium', 'Cinematography', 'was', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'was', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'leading', 'performance', 'deserved', 'estimation', 'film', 'rather', 'leaden', 'tacky', 'looking', 'one', 'why', 'anyone', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'today', 'audiences', 'one', 'overlooked', 'gem', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'supporting', 'performance', 'wonderful', 'job', 'making', 'bore', 'actually', 'appealing']",N/A

(No, I'm not going to play with homonyms here.)  What disturbed me about the sex was that we didn't know the two characters at all, really, before they started stripping and grinding.  It was antiseptic and off-putting.  Rea's character had no shading, and I suspect it was more the script than the actor; he became boring not because he was supposed to be (although he was), but in addition to that.  Moore was very good, but I think she's outdone her work here many times (see Safe, Vanya, Short Cuts, Magnolia).  And oh my gosh, even if the movie had sold me from the first frame, I don't think my admiration could have survived that demure little cough in Brighton, which reminded me instantly of Carol Burnett's take-off on Ali MacGraw's doomed heroine in Love Story.Read the novel.

But if what you look in the  cinema its a film with a perfect cast, directed by an artist filmmaker,  with a brillant screenplay, based on a novel of one of the best writers of  the century: The End of the Affair is a sure bet.  Based on a Graham  Green's novel, The End Of the Affair was originally made in the 50s with  Deborah Kerr as the unfaithfull wife and Van Johnson as the jealous lover.  I confess that I saw the 90s version completelly virgin because I haven't  read the book, or seen the earlier version, so with nothing to compare Neil  Jordan's version, I absolutelly loved this film. Why? Let me count the  ways: First the screenplay: beautiful dialogues, one liners and silences;  all the characters are extraordinary and the plot is full of surprises;  Second: The cast; They are perfect: Ralph Fiennes as the jealous lover is  better than in The English Patient, maybe  because Julianne Moore, as the  enigmatic Sarah, makes  believable all the passion felt for her by  the men  on the story(and the boy too); and I shouldn't forget the unpassionate  husband(why did she married him?), the clumsy and sentimental private  detective, and his marked boy, and God, who is the big antagonist of the  film.

19977,ACAO2J1XCS4FL,0767832485,Alexander Suraev,"[5, 9]","Julianne Moore and Ralph Fiennes as doomed lovers in The Blitz-time London, dressed in the period costumes, consumed by larger-than-life passion and torn apart by Fate. The score by Michael Nyman. A touches of British eccentricy provided by the shy but reletless investigator and his apprentice son. A plot originating from Graham Greene novel.Looks like a kit for making a great movie.  I think the wrong steps were taken at the assembling stage.Sometimes it's hard to comprehend seeing the film for the first time where to place the scenes we witness - in the pre-Split period or post-Split. There are so many flashbacks. That's why I began to really pay attention. For my effort I was rewarded with that fateful explosion in Variant 1 and just a short time later in Variant 2, revised and updated. The problem is that it was evident for the first time what resolution Sarah decided to make. But the director felt he has to chew it to help us swallow. That's very thoughtful - why am I annoyed?The film's erotism is very gratuitous. Neil Jordan for some reason is eager to show us more Julianne's skin than we had a chance to see in Boogie Nights - the movie where her character is a pornstar. The love scenes look like the usual content of a hotel TV softcore channels. I appreciate and treasure female nudity, but to see the two intelligent and &quot;serious&quot; actors wiggling and heaving so many times for so many minutes in such detail is something I'd prefer to avoid.The characters' current situation is presented without any explanation. What made Sarah marry the dullard? Why do they stay together - Victorian Britain is in the past and divorces are obtainable? And why do we have to sympathize with her lover - the self-absorbed writer, who is not above spying and reporting on his mistress to her husband and his friend? Because he is played by Ralph Fiennes? All the film we are led to believe Sarah is a modern saint, who is ready to give the gift of her love to the very unworthy. And at the end Heavens claim Sarah back, showing the men they do not deserve her. All that seems very artificial.Maybe one of the reasons for that is the fact that I was raised outside of any religious tradition. Reading Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited I could not understand what's the deal just as I am not in the clear about the religious implications in the film. But somehow I feel I am not alone in my ignorance.My impression of the film is as muddled as it's direction, but The End of Affair left me with the definite 3-star feeling.",3,Leaves the 3-star feeling.,974678400,"11 20, 2000",2000,2544,"['Julianne', 'Moore', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'doomed', 'lovers', 'Blitz-time', 'London', 'dressed', 'period', 'costumes', 'consumed', 'larger-than-life', 'passion', 'torn', 'apart', 'Fate', 'score', 'Michael', 'Nyman', 'touches', 'British', 'eccentricy', 'provided', 'shy', 'reletless', 'investigator', 'apprentice', 'son', 'plot', 'originating', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'kit', 'making', 'great', 'movie', 'think', 'wrong', 'steps', 'were', 'taken', 'assembling', 'stage.Sometimes', 'hard', 'comprehend', 'seeing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'where', 'place', 'scenes', 'witness', 'pre-Split', 'period', 'post-Split', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'why', 'began', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'effort', 'was', 'rewarded', 'fateful', 'explosion', 'Variant', '1', 'just', 'short', 'time', 'later', 'Variant', '2', 'revised', 'updated', 'problem', 'was', 'evident', 'first', 'time', 'what', 'resolution', 'Sarah', 'decided', 'make', 'director', 'felt', 'chew', 'help', 'swallow', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'why', 'am', 'annoyed', 'film', 'erotism', 'very', 'gratuitous', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'reason', 'eager', 'show', 'more', 'Julianne', 'skin', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'movie', 'where', 'character', 'pornstar', 'love', 'scenes', 'look', 'usual', 'content', 'hotel', 'TV', 'softcore', 'channels', 'appreciate', 'treasure', 'female', 'nudity', 'see', 'two', 'intelligent', 'quot', 'serious', 'quot', 'actors', 'wiggling', 'heaving', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'so', 'many', 'minutes', 'such', 'detail', 'something', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'avoid.The', 'characters', 'current', 'situation', 'presented', 'explanation', 'What', 'made', 'Sarah', 'marry', 'dullard', 'Why', 'do', 'stay', 'together', 'Victorian', 'Britain', 'past', 'divorces', 'are', 'obtainable', 'why', 'do', 'have', 'sympathize', 'self-absorbed', 'writer', 'who', 'not', 'spying', 'reporting', 'mistress', 'husband', 'friend', 'played', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'film', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'Sarah', 'modern', 'saint', 'who', 'ready', 'give', 'gift', 'love', 'very', 'unworthy', 'end', 'Heavens', 'claim', 'Sarah', 'back', 'showing', 'men', 'do', 'not', 'deserve', 'very', 'artificial.Maybe', 'one', 'reasons', 'fact', 'was', 'raised', 'religious', 'tradition', 'Reading', 'Evelyn', 'Waugh', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'deal', 'just', 'am', 'not', 'clear', 'religious', 'implications', 'film', 'somehow', 'feel', 'am', 'not', 'alone', 'ignorance.My', 'impression', 'film', 'as', 'muddled', 'direction', 'End', 'Affair', 'left', 'definite', '3-star', 'feeling']",N/A

19980,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767832485,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","I had heard nothing but good things fort his film, mainly when concerning Julianne Moore's performance.  While I had never really had an interest in seeing this I decided to give it a try based solely on all the good press.  I'm actually astonished it received such a warm welcome for it seems to me that it would be the type of film critics would love to destroy.  There are so many facets of this film that are weak.  For one it took a while to get adjusted to the constant shifts in time.  There are so many flashbacks that it's difficult at first to differentiate between what is happening now and what happened before.  Another weakness is the script, which in my opinion could have been much tighter, much stronger.  It's hard to understand what drew these two together in the first place.  The affair is never really fleshed out to be the beautiful thing we're supposed to believe it to be.  In effect the two main characters become less and less sympathetic, and that's a real travesty since as the film comes to a close it depends more and more on the viewers sympathies.A third weakness is the acting.  I know, I know, so many people laud over the performances, not just of Moore, but of Fiennes as well but I must say that I found neither of them entirely convincing.  Moore was decent but far from Oscar Worthy in my humble opinion.  Her performance was more subtle than Fiennes and maybe that's why I appreciated it a bit more.  Fiennes to me was far too over the top.  He was trying too hard to capture this air of hatred and depression, of loss and self loathing that he became a walking clich&eacute;.  As the film progressed I found myself becoming more and more detached from his character.The film centers around a novelist Maurice Bendrix.  This novelist begins the film by stating that this is his diary of hate, although he doesn't quite understand yet who he is hating.  Then we proceed to find Maurice in contact with an old friend Henry Miles, a man he hasn't seen in years.  They strike up a conversation and Maurice becomes informed of Henry's predicament.  Henry believes his wife Sarah to be having an affair.  A few years back Maurice and Sarah were lovers and so this newfound knowledge strikes a jealous curiosity in Maurice who decides to hire a private detective to follow Sarah's every move and relay to him the identity of her new lover.  You see their affair ended without closure.  Sarah just stopped seeing Maurice altogether and this has plagued his every waking moment for the past two years.  As the investigation continues Maurice and Sarah are reunited and truths are revealed regarding her new `affair' and her reasons for ending things with Maurice in the first place.I guess the biggest fault I can find with this movie is that it never really made me believe in their unbridled love.  I could feel their passion, but that's all it was to me, blind lustful passion.  I guess maybe I'm being too critical, or at least some will think that I am, but then again I'll just think your being to forgiving, maybe because Moore is your favorite actress or Fiennes your favorite actor, and for that I can understand.  Honestly though, as far as romantic love stories go, this is far from the head of the pack.",2,Its lack of emotional depth left me longing for the end of the movie...,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,3247,"['had', 'heard', 'nothing', 'good', 'things', 'fort', 'film', 'mainly', 'when', 'concerning', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'performance', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'interest', 'seeing', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'based', 'solely', 'good', 'press', ""'m"", 'actually', 'astonished', 'received', 'warm', 'welcome', 'would', 'be', 'type', 'film', 'critics', 'would', 'love', 'destroy', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'facets', 'film', 'are', 'weak', 'one', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'adjusted', 'constant', 'shifts', 'time', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'difficult', 'first', 'differentiate', 'what', 'happening', 'now', 'what', 'happened', 'before', 'weakness', 'script', 'opinion', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'tighter', 'much', 'stronger', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'drew', 'two', 'together', 'first', 'place', 'affair', 'never', 'really', 'fleshed', 'out', 'be', 'beautiful', 'thing', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'be', 'effect', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'become', 'less', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'real', 'travesty', 'film', 'close', 'more', 'more', 'viewers', 'sympathies.A', 'third', 'weakness', 'acting', 'know', 'know', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'laud', 'performances', 'not', 'just', 'Moore', 'Fiennes', 'well', 'must', 'say', 'found', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'Moore', 'was', 'decent', 'far', 'Oscar', 'Worthy', 'humble', 'opinion', 'performance', 'was', 'more', 'subtle', 'Fiennes', 'maybe', 'why', 'appreciated', 'bit', 'more', 'Fiennes', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'top', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'capture', 'air', 'hatred', 'depression', 'loss', 'self', 'loathing', 'became', 'walking', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'progressed', 'found', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'detached', 'character.The', 'film', 'centers', 'novelist', 'Maurice', 'Bendrix', 'novelist', 'film', 'stating', 'diary', 'hate', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'yet', 'who', 'hating', 'Then', 'proceed', 'find', 'Maurice', 'contact', 'old', 'friend', 'Henry', 'Miles', 'man', ""n't"", 'seen', 'years', 'strike', 'up', 'conversation', 'Maurice', 'becomes', 'informed', 'Henry', 'predicament', 'Henry', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'be', 'having', 'affair', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Maurice', 'Sarah', 'were', 'lovers', 'so', 'newfound', 'knowledge', 'jealous', 'curiosity', 'Maurice', 'who', 'hire', 'private', 'detective', 'follow', 'Sarah', 'move', 'relay', 'identity', 'new', 'lover', 'see', 'affair', 'ended', 'closure', 'Sarah', 'just', 'stopped', 'seeing', 'Maurice', 'altogether', 'plagued', 'waking', 'moment', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'investigation', 'Maurice', 'Sarah', 'are', 'reunited', 'truths', 'are', 'revealed', 'regarding', 'new', 'affair', 'reasons', 'ending', 'things', 'Maurice', 'first', 'place.I', 'guess', 'biggest', 'fault', 'can', 'find', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'believe', 'unbridled', 'love', 'could', 'feel', 'passion', 'was', 'blind', 'lustful', 'passion', 'guess', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'critical', 'least', 'will', 'think', 'am', 'then', 'again', ""'ll"", 'just', 'think', 'being', 'forgiving', 'maybe', 'Moore', 'favorite', 'actress', 'Fiennes', 'favorite', 'actor', 'can', 'understand', 'Honestly', 'though', 'as', 'far', 'romantic', 'love', 'stories', 'go', 'far', 'head', 'pack']",N/A
19981,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,0767832485,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[3, 8]","This British soap-opera weepie tries very hard to be an expanded BRIEF ENCOUNTER, that Noel Coward gem that I've reviewed and rated five stars.  There is the same understatement, which I actually like very much.  But the  director had to throw in extremely boring graphic scenes of lovemaking that  look like a pathetic attempt to get the British equivalent of an R rating.  If all the tussling in bed were cut out, if the long lingering shots of the  rain and the restaurants were reduced drastically, if the direction didn't  seem so turbid, turgid, and sleepy, then maybe this would rate three or  four stars.  Instead there is the sophomoric re-telling of the story, where  you have to watch the same painfully slow scenes a second time, and  sometimes a third time.  It's as if the flashbacks have gotten into a fight  with the flashforwards and had it out on the playing fields of Eton. But  the main problem I had with this movie--a problem I have with nearly every  Graham Greene novel--is that what is set up as a suspense/detective story a  la Agatha Christie turns out to be far, far less than that.

19982,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,0767832485,atmj,"[4, 9]","I was expecting much more from Julianna Moore and Ralph Fiennes. They both  have such potential but, in my opinion no screen chemistry.  From the other  reviews I've seen, I'm surprised that others saw so much more.  For me it  just wasn't there, like it was with Ralph Fiennes in the English patient.The story is an old one.  A writer meets and befriends a British  diplomat who not only spends too much time away from home, but has a  attractive young wife.  The diplomat is Stephen Rea, a man who appears in  this movie to be absolutely without sexual passion.  Ralph Fiennes plays  the part of the writer who lives nearby and obviously has much more time  and passion available. Juliana Moore is the young left-alone-often wife.  She soon becomes involved with the writer when the busy diplomat suggests  that his wife accompany the writer to a movie they both wish to see.  The  writer is the author of the film.I found the first part of this movie  confusing, as it starts 2 years after the love affair happened and the  writer once again renews the friendship with the diplomat.  This beginning  is interspersed with flashbacks and it takes some figuring to know what  timeframe you are seeing.At this time 2 years after the affair has  ended, the husband tells the writer that he thinks his wife is having an  affair and is toying with the idea of hiring a private detective.  The  writer having been previously involved with her and maybe afraid of what  the P.I. could find out, reassures him that this couldn't be further from  the truth.  The husband reassured drops the idea.  The writer, still the  jealous former lover, does not and wants to know what his former lover is  up to.  He hires the P.I. himself and comes to some shocking  conclusions.In the meantime the wife wants to talk to her former lover.  Ralph Fiennes is cool to the idea. Obviously, she was the one who ended the  affair.  She tries to make amends but Ralph Fiennes will have none of  it.In the flashbacks what particularly struck me was the matter of fact  way Ralph Fiennes and Julianna Moore were with each other when they first  made love.  I felt it was without life.  Subsequent interactions and  conversations, seemed very implausible.  When Ralph Fiennes says he is  jealous of her stocking it is hardly believable.  He just doesn't seem  there in the scene.The story from two years past shows how they  continued their affair in the buildings during bombing raids when the  apartments were evacuated.  This eventually becomes their undoing as a  bomb strikes nearby that ends the relationship.  I won't say what happened,  but you know both survive due to the movies two year later telling.  The  relationship does not however.When you see during Ralph Fiennes  recollection of their last time together, you realize he has no idea why  she stopped seeing him.  It seems all so cold.  Which is why he is not at  all understanding to her when he thinks she is involved with someone else.  In fact so much he goes to her husband with the news.  This only proves to  the husband that the writer, his friend was once involved with her.Later  the P.I digs something up that serves to show Ralph Fiennes, why the young  wife stopped the affair, he goes to her with this knowledge and she  reluctantly admits she has not enjoyed life since they broke up and they  start anew.  The movie has more twists, but it would be unfair to ruin it  for you.The reason she left him was surprising.  The ending of the  movie is unusual.  I think then you see Ralph Fiennes strong suit.  However, all it all it was not very romantic and quite disappointing.  Ironically, when I saw the ending I had to admit, that Stephen Rea gets  into some odd relationships in his movies.",3,Disappointing,968544000,"09 10, 2000",2000,3748,"['was', 'expecting', 'much', 'more', 'Julianna', 'Moore', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'have', 'such', 'potential', 'opinion', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'others', 'saw', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'was', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'English', 'patient.The', 'story', 'old', 'one', 'writer', 'meets', 'British', 'diplomat', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'away', 'home', 'attractive', 'young', 'wife', 'diplomat', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'man', 'who', 'movie', 'be', 'absolutely', 'sexual', 'passion', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'part', 'writer', 'who', 'nearby', 'obviously', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'passion', 'available', 'Juliana', 'Moore', 'young', 'left-alone-often', 'wife', 'soon', 'involved', 'writer', 'when', 'busy', 'diplomat', 'wife', 'accompany', 'writer', 'movie', 'wish', 'see', 'writer', 'author', 'film.I', 'found', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'confusing', '2', 'years', 'love', 'affair', 'happened', 'writer', 'once', 'again', 'renews', 'friendship', 'diplomat', 'beginning', 'interspersed', 'flashbacks', 'figuring', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'seeing.At', 'time', '2', 'years', 'affair', 'ended', 'husband', 'writer', 'wife', 'having', 'affair', 'toying', 'idea', 'hiring', 'private', 'detective', 'writer', 'having', 'been', 'previously', 'involved', 'maybe', 'afraid', 'what', 'P.I', 'could', 'find', 'out', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'husband', 'reassured', 'idea', 'writer', 'still', 'jealous', 'former', 'lover', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'former', 'lover', 'up', 'P.I', 'shocking', 'conclusions.In', 'meantime', 'wife', 'talk', 'former', 'lover', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'cool', 'idea', 'Obviously', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'ended', 'affair', 'make', 'amends', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'it.In', 'flashbacks', 'what', 'particularly', 'struck', 'was', 'matter', 'fact', 'way', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Julianna', 'Moore', 'were', 'other', 'when', 'first', 'made', 'love', 'felt', 'was', 'life', 'Subsequent', 'interactions', 'conversations', 'seemed', 'very', 'implausible', 'When', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'jealous', 'stocking', 'hardly', 'believable', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'there', 'scene.The', 'story', 'two', 'years', 'shows', 'how', 'continued', 'affair', 'buildings', 'bombing', 'raids', 'when', 'apartments', 'were', 'evacuated', 'eventually', 'undoing', 'bomb', 'nearby', 'relationship', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'happened', 'know', 'survive', 'due', 'movies', 'two', 'year', 'later', 'telling', 'relationship', 'not', 'however.When', 'see', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'recollection', 'last', 'time', 'together', 'realize', 'idea', 'why', 'stopped', 'seeing', 'so', 'cold', 'Which', 'why', 'not', 'understanding', 'when', 'involved', 'someone', 'else', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'husband', 'news', 'only', 'husband', 'writer', 'friend', 'was', 'once', 'involved', 'her.Later', 'P.I', 'digs', 'something', 'up', 'show', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'why', 'young', 'wife', 'stopped', 'affair', 'knowledge', 'reluctantly', 'not', 'enjoyed', 'life', 'broke', 'up', 'start', 'anew', 'movie', 'more', 'twists', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'ruin', 'you.The', 'reason', 'left', 'was', 'surprising', 'ending', 'movie', 'unusual', 'think', 'then', 'see', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'strong', 'suit', 'However', 'all', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'romantic', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'Ironically', 'when', 'saw', 'ending', 'had', 'admit', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'odd', 'relationships', 'movies']",N/A

But it not only missed, it swung backwards.  This is one of the most overmelodramatic,  immature, and plainly stupid &quot;romances&quot; I've ever had the  displeasure to endure.  The plot is exceedingly boring and pathetically  infeasible, the characters are flat and hateful, and the dialog is  laughably, absurdly moronic.  This isn't a good film, or even a fair one.  It is, frankly, a painful visit to an embarrassingly self-indulgent,  adolescent view of the world of love, and a regrettable mar on the resumes  of the talents involved; ironically, the generally fine acting is the only  minor saving grace in a movie that, unfortunately, can't be saved by its  acting talent.  Not even close.  That these fine actors could all find  themselves in such filmmaking compost together so readily is somewhat  shocking.  Further, for all of the myth surrounding Graham Greene's  synonymous passion and private life, based on the circumstantial evidence  that this movie represents (assuming it's at all an accurate reflection of  his work, which it likely isn't), one would be forced to conclude that most  pre-teens have a more worldly, mature view of relationships.  This  &quot;romance&quot; is for the connect-the-dots crowd, with a very small  number of dots.  If you like real romance, along the lines of The English  Patient and Wuthering Heights, and you have an IQ over 80, save your money.  Save your time.

Ten minutes into the movie, you're engaged in an entangled grope fest between Maurice and  Henry's wife Sarah, after their meeting in a small aristocratic gathering.  It is unclear why they are so drawn to eachother, it's not love, nor  attraction. To be blunt, they just seem really sex-starved.  And as the  plot thickens, we learn not only are they sex-starved, but Sarah is  sex-deprived (in her marriage) as well.  The movie jumps back and forth  between the present and the past.  All the while, Maurice tries to deny the  existence of God.  It takes two miracles, the end of THE affair, and  finally a death for him to realize that he's in the wrong.  All of which he  cowardly shakes off, and seemingly lives on and writes his book.  Since the  ""supposed"" love between Sarah and him was so strong, I would expect some  great revelation or sacrifice from Maurice, but to no avail. I was let  down.

The movie is about the  strength of religion and faith, about making bargains with God, especially  a Catholic God.  It is about how love, betrayal and infidelity can get  caught on the shoals of bargains with God.

From THE COMPANY OF WOLVES to IN DREAMS and INTERVIEW OF A VAMPIRE, Neil Jordan's movies explore the fascinating territory of our intimate fears and fantasies. His last movie THE END OF THE AFFAIR, though not a film dedicated to one of our contemporary myths, is a movie about faith and belief. Ralph Fiennes will not believe in Julianne Moore's exclusive love until he has the written proof of it right in front of his eyes.Adapted from a novel of Graham Greene and written for the screen by Neil Jordan, THE END OF THE AFFAIR is one of the three best movies I have seen this year so far.

19990,A3MKHD3AKS69BH,0767832485,"Danny Kim ""Taste""","[1, 1]","Upon seeing this film in a quiet Culver City theater, it left an impression that was difficult to shake. Perhaps it was Michael Nyman's score, which is flowing with emotion from the onset of Columbia's torch bearing lady. Maybe it was the trio of wonderful performances from Ralph Fiennes (The English Patient, Schindler's List, Strange Days), Julianne Moore (Boogie Nights, Safe, the upcoming Hannibal), and Neil Jordan perennial cast member, Stephen Rea (The Crying Game, The Butcher Boy). Ian Hart is also effective in a quaint detective role, serving as some kind of bystander to all the drama in the trio of lead characters.Jordan's commentary mirrors my feelings toward this piece; a story wrought with so much irony that the story is reduced to characters clinging to their memories and need for godliness in their empty lives. After their lust recedes, the need for depth arises.

19993,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0767832485,D. Litton,"[2, 3]","&quot;This is a diary of hate,&quot; writes Maurice Bendrix, beginning the narration of &quot;The End of the Affair,&quot; a highly sensual and emotional melodrama that takes place during 1939 in war-torn England, where two people will discover a love that can resist all boundaries, even that of marraige. Through the intensely creative eyes of director Neil Jordan, the story of this love comes to life through artful cinematography, a highly impactful story and complex characters that weave the vivid web of desire and chance.Henry and Sarah Miles, who live in England, share nothing but a house and words, no intimacy or words of love. One night at a party, Sarah in introduced to Maurice Bendrix, one of her husband's acquaintances, who is a novelist whose books become motion pictures. There is an immediate attraction, and after spending an afternoon and evening together, they embark on a lustful and passionate journey into the depths of love and devotion. When the war makes its way to their city, they are only able to see one another in the shelter of the exploding bombs and air raids. One day, Sarah walks out of his life, telling him that &quot;Love does not end, simply because you do not see me.&quot; After two years, Bendrix and Henry cross paths again, and Henry confesses his suspicions of his wife's adulterous actions. Bendrix becomes determined to discover the secrets Sarah is hiding, all the while falling more and more in love with her again, and what he discovers will lead to a shocking revelation for the both of them.Based on the novel by Graham Greene, who is supposedly the person that Maurice is based upon, &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; is a gorgeous and almost lyrical tapestry of events that all fall into place like a canvas of pastels. Jordan uses flashbacks and memories to tell a major part of the story, with Maurice narrating each event as he is writing his memoirs. As he recounts the events that lead to he and Sarah's reunion, the characters are able to develop complexity and integrity, and the audience can fully appreciate and understand the actions they take and the emotions they feel.Neil Jordan's own sense of style comes to play in the film as well, with his use of multiple flashbacks and certain color schemes. It is raining most of the time in the movie, which adds to the coldness and isolation that the characters feel when they are separated from one another. He is also able to bring to life the city of London during the war, with authentic building structure and the elegance of aristocratic homes and public places.The story, while being quite simple, is made incredibly complex by the affair, and in turn makes the movie strikingly original. When their affair is abruptly ended by Sarah, the intensity begins as Maurice begins his search for the answers he has been waiting for for two years. He takes the audience along with him on this journey, and through the narration of different characters and the exploration by his private eye, we learn the secrets of Sarah's heart and her reasons for leaving. This also leads to Maurice's inner conflicts with God, his disbelief in Him, and Sarah's coming to terms with her religious background and beliefs.Of all the characters in the film, Sarah is the most complex and attention-grabbing. In the beginning, she seems normal and content with her life, even when she begins her affair with Maurice. She knows that she loves him and not her husband, which proves that she knows her heart. But, as the film progresses, we soon learn that their is another side to her, one that is not easy to explain. This has to do with her reasons for leaving Maurice, and what she feels for him after leaving. Julianna Moore does a stunning job portraying all of these emotions, and fits the role perfectly. Ralph Fiennes is remarkable as Bendrix, and is able to convey the jealousy and possessiveness of him in a straightforward and believable manner. Stephen Rea, while not having a lot of onscreen time, plays the role of Henry wonderfully, though his character is nothing more than downcast and trodden most of the film's duration.Visually stunning, highly sensual and emotional, &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; is an entertaining and complex journey along the path of the unknown chambers of one's heart. Once everything falls into place in the ending, we realize that there was so much more going on than we originally thought, how different people react to different events, and the overall quest to gain the love and affection everyone looks for in life.",4,Eloquent tale of love and hate.,980726400,"01 29, 2001",2001,4563,"['quot', 'diary', 'hate', 'quot', 'Maurice', 'Bendrix', 'beginning', 'narration', 'quot', 'End', 'Affair', 'quot', 'highly', 'sensual', 'emotional', 'melodrama', 'place', '1939', 'war-torn', 'England', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'will', 'discover', 'love', 'can', 'resist', 'boundaries', 'even', 'marraige', 'intensely', 'creative', 'eyes', 'director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'story', 'love', 'life', 'artful', 'cinematography', 'highly', 'impactful', 'story', 'complex', 'characters', 'weave', 'vivid', 'web', 'desire', 'chance.Henry', 'Sarah', 'Miles', 'who', 'live', 'England', 'share', 'nothing', 'house', 'words', 'intimacy', 'words', 'love', 'One', 'night', 'party', 'Sarah', 'introduced', 'Maurice', 'Bendrix', 'one', 'husband', 'acquaintances', 'who', 'novelist', 'books', 'become', 'motion', 'pictures', 'immediate', 'attraction', 'spending', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'together', 'embark', 'lustful', 'passionate', 'journey', 'depths', 'love', 'devotion', 'When', 'war', 'way', 'city', 'are', 'only', 'able', 'see', 'one', 'shelter', 'exploding', 'bombs', 'air', 'raids', 'One', 'day', 'Sarah', 'life', 'telling', 'quot', 'Love', 'not', 'end', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'me.', 'quot', 'two', 'years', 'Bendrix', 'Henry', 'cross', 'paths', 'again', 'Henry', 'suspicions', 'wife', 'adulterous', 'actions', 'Bendrix', 'becomes', 'determined', 'discover', 'secrets', 'Sarah', 'hiding', 'while', 'falling', 'more', 'more', 'love', 'again', 'what', 'will', 'lead', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'them.Based', 'novel', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'who', 'supposedly', 'person', 'Maurice', 'based', 'quot', 'End', 'Affair', 'quot', 'gorgeous', 'almost', 'lyrical', 'tapestry', 'events', 'fall', 'place', 'canvas', 'pastels', 'Jordan', 'flashbacks', 'memories', 'tell', 'major', 'part', 'story', 'Maurice', 'narrating', 'event', 'writing', 'memoirs', 'events', 'lead', 'Sarah', 'reunion', 'characters', 'are', 'able', 'develop', 'complexity', 'integrity', 'audience', 'can', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'understand', 'actions', 'take', 'emotions', 'feel.Neil', 'Jordan', 'own', 'sense', 'style', 'play', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'use', 'multiple', 'flashbacks', 'certain', 'color', 'schemes', 'raining', 'most', 'time', 'movie', 'coldness', 'isolation', 'characters', 'feel', 'when', 'are', 'separated', 'one', 'also', 'able', 'bring', 'life', 'city', 'London', 'war', 'authentic', 'building', 'structure', 'elegance', 'aristocratic', 'homes', 'public', 'places.The', 'story', 'being', 'quite', 'simple', 'made', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'affair', 'turn', 'movie', 'strikingly', 'original', 'When', 'affair', 'abruptly', 'ended', 'Sarah', 'intensity', 'Maurice', 'search', 'answers', 'been', 'waiting', 'two', 'years', 'audience', 'journey', 'narration', 'different', 'characters', 'exploration', 'private', 'eye', 'learn', 'secrets', 'Sarah', 'heart', 'reasons', 'leaving', 'also', 'Maurice', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'God', 'disbelief', 'Him', 'Sarah', 'coming', 'terms', 'religious', 'background', 'beliefs.Of', 'characters', 'film', 'Sarah', 'most', 'complex', 'attention-grabbing', 'beginning', 'normal', 'content', 'life', 'even', 'when', 'affair', 'Maurice', 'not', 'husband', 'heart', 'film', 'soon', 'learn', 'side', 'one', 'not', 'easy', 'explain', 'do', 'reasons', 'leaving', 'Maurice', 'what', 'leaving', 'Julianna', 'Moore', 'stunning', 'job', 'portraying', 'emotions', 'role', 'perfectly', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'remarkable', 'Bendrix', 'able', 'convey', 'jealousy', 'possessiveness', 'straightforward', 'believable', 'manner', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'not', 'having', 'lot', 'onscreen', 'time', 'role', 'Henry', 'wonderfully', 'character', 'nothing', 'more', 'downcast', 'trodden', 'most', 'film', 'duration.Visually', 'stunning', 'highly', 'sensual', 'emotional', 'quot', 'End', 'Affair', 'quot', 'entertaining', 'complex', 'journey', 'path', 'unknown', 'chambers', 'one', 'heart', 'Once', 'everything', 'place', 'ending', 'realize', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'going', 'originally', 'thought', 'how', 'different', 'people', 'react', 'different', 'events', 'overall', 'quest', 'gain', 'love', 'affection', 'everyone', 'life']",N/A

19997,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0767832485,"""flickjunkie""","[12, 14]","This is an engrossing tale of love, passion and betrayal invloving three star-crossed lovers.  Maurice Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes) is a man haunted by jealousy and pain over an affair he had with the wife of one of his  friends, Henry Miles (Stephen Rea).  The affair has been over for two years  when a chance encounter with Miles takes Bendrix to his house where he once  again encounters Sarah (Julianne Moore).  The obsession for her returns  when Henry tells him that he suspects that Sarah is having an affair. At  hearing this Maurice gets jealous, thinking that he has been replaced as  her paramour.  What follows is a complex and tangled web of suspicion,  jealousy and dolor.This is a wonderfully complicated story that opens  slowly like a flower.  It is a first person narrative delivered by Bendrix  and it gets more intriguing as the film progresses.  The use of flashbacks  is subtlety effective, where the realizations about misinterpretations come  not from the dialogue, but from seeing the same scene from two  perspectives.  The love scenes are sensuously done and the general tone of  the film is poignant and sensitive.The film was nicely photographed with  various filters to give it an old feel without losing the richness.  Director Neil Jordan did a fine job of giving the film a genuine look of  the period with proper English costumes from the 1940's.Ralph Fiennes  was excellent as the jealous lover.  He played the character as civilized  and staid with molten lava just beneath the surface.  He was masterful at  conveying strong emotion with a sideways glance or hand gesture without  losing his composure.Julianne Moore has added another fabulous dramatic  performance to her resume as Sarah.  She played the part with fatalistic  passion, victimized by vortex of events she felt powerless to  control.Stephen Rea also shined as the impassive cuckold.  Rea tends to  be very understated in his portrayals, often too much so.  But he was the  perfect choice for the hapless Miles; so intellectual, withdrawn and  defenseless.  His phlegmatic response upon being confronted by Bendrix  about their affair, showed a resigned helplessness that was both pathetic  and believable.I enjoyed this film immensely and gave it a 9/10.  It is  finespun yet powerful.  It takes its time unfolding, so if you like pace  this film might test your patience.

With World War II as the backdrop, despite the futility in the whole affair-debacle, the viewer can take some odd comfort in knowing love was still very much a part of man's driving force in such terrible times.As Ralph Fiennes so perfectly embodies Bendrix with his flirtations of atheism and wanton lust, Julianne Moore provides us with an adultress even the most moral could secretly admire.  Stephen Rea does a brilliant job of portraying the non-complaining, true and steady English gentleman in the face of embarrassment and death.  Each of the three face a personal inner struggle, but the one to watch is Moore in the role of Sarah Miles.  By looking at her torment, we see another love triangle present in the story, and that is the one between herself, God, and Bendrix.  &quot;I've made but two vows in my life-- one was to marry Henry, the other was to stop seeing you (Bendrix), and I'm too weak to keep either.&quot;  How many times have we all been faced with such realizations of powerlessness?The film is honest in its depictions of physical love, so spare the kids from seeing this one just yet.

Julianne Moore shines as Sarah, a woman married to a dull government worker, who makes a bargain with God to sacrifice love for a religion she has heretofore thwarted.  Ralph Fiennes quietly smoulders as Ms. Moore's lover, a writer who shuns religion and seems to exist solely on the intensity of his hate.  Stephen Rea gives a touching if somewhat pathetic performance as the cuckolded husband.  Notice also that whenever he appears on screen, he's either standing out in the rain or coming in from the rain.  I understand the metaphor but I do think it comes a little heavy-handed. Ian Hart also shines in a supporting role as the investigator hired to follow Ms. Moore.The images are haunting, some in particular will stay with you for a long time.  Michael Nyman's score is also particularly gorgeous.I'm giving this four stars because while the film overall is very involving, there is a certain element that remains detached. These aren't the most welcoming characters, and while one has sympathy for Sarah's dilemma you never really feel a warmth for her. And in the end, one wonders - is she some sort of saint with these amazing powers to heal?

Besides having a  challenging structure  (all those flashbacks!), the movie provides a  compelling mystery:  the hows and whys of an illicit affair in WWII  England.  Jordan reveals those hows and whys at a measured, though never  less than intense, pace, which is all the more restrained when you consider  how chatty it could have been with the first-person narrative structure  (used sparingly, thank God).  Speaking of God, in this movie He makes an  impact considerably less touchy-feely than in other films, where He usually  comes off as a kindly old Santy Claus or something.  THIS God makes you  keep your promises.  Perhaps this explains why  &quot;The End of the  Affair&quot;  didn't do all that well in this country, by the way.Plenty  of good stuff in this movie;  perhaps most notably the Bombing scene,  stunningly filmed TWICE, from two different angles and psychological  points-of-view.  This type of thing is usually done poorly in most films.  Here, it offers the rewards of insight.  Julianne Moore's reason for  breaking off the affair becomes utterly, even horribly explicable.  The  characters are well-written, as you might expect, and ably performed by the  talented actors.  Jordan even manages to make the surprisingly heated sex  scenes compelling, as opposed to embarrassing, to watch.To quibble:  I  almost wished for some bits of levity throughout, if only because the  verrry serious tone was a bit much at times, and the ponderous music didn't  help -- but that's strictly my taste.  But perhaps even because of the  seriousness, Jordan succeeds in sweeping you away to a certain time and  place.  His movie is chock full of real passion and real tragedy.  And the  religious ruminations are icing on the cake.

Two years later, Maurice meets her husband who suspects she is carrying on with someone; Maurice hires a private investigator to follow her, and falls in love with Sarah again.This is probably a tear-jerking, steamy, and sentimental love story but I just didn't feel it.  Fiennes, Moore and Stephen Rea, as Sarah's husband, play 95% of their scenes in slow-motion, with completely expressionless faces staring blankly into each other's eyes while their stoic voices recite passionate lines.  I suppose it's meant to be very sophisticated and posh, but it seemed phony and empty to me.  The character I liked best was Parkis, the private investigator, played by Ian Hart.  (Note to Harry Potter fans:  This movie has Professor Quirrell, Lucius Malfoy, and Voldemort all together!)  Parkis was the one who tied up all the loose ends and was the only character who seemed emotionally open and honest.  A nice subplot involving his son made me smile at the end, despite the vacuous love story.The excellent WWII-period sets and costumes gave the movie a lot of atmosphere; it was the detached acting style that left me feeling nothing.

20008,A1YVPBDG2OFMD2,0767832485,Leif Sheppard,"[2, 2]","At first glance, ""The End of the Affair"" appears to have all the earmarks of a classic World War II romance in the spirit of ""Casablanca"". The film features the promise of an old-fashioned weepy love story and a superlative cast in the form of Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore, Stephen Rea, and Jason Isaacs. Fiennes plays Maurice Bendix, a novelist by trade who falls madly in love with Sarah (Moore), the wife of Henry Miles (Rea). As the title subtly suggests, this film takes the atypical route of sympathetically focusing on the adulterers, as opposed to the more familiar yarn of a spurned spouse seething. The film is based off a tale from legendary author Graham Greene (the man who wrote, among other classics, ""The Third Man"") and is the second adaptation of the book (after 1955's ""The End of the Affair""). Unfortunately, the strong cast and classic premise are undermined by a tepid screenplay that never draws the viewer in. It's difficult to care much about Maurice or Sarah, not because they're adulterers or unlikeable, they're just not particularly interesting characters.The story unfolds in flashback, with the film frequently alternating between past and present. This disjointed narrative is something of a conceit, as it gives the initial illusion that the rather pedestrian romance is something more complex. The film is well-edited, in the sense that it's not difficult to follow, but often the film will retread scenes from a slightly varied perspective. If executed carefully this can be a masterful technique, yet its use here is clumsy and ineffectual. It stalls the pacing of the film and begins to bore after awhile. There are copious love-making scenes between Maurice and Sarah which are amply amorous yet don't drive the narrative forward. Their relationship is devoid of any real pathos, appearing instead based purely on sex. In reality, I suppose that's a good enough reason for some, but it doesn't quite make intriguing material for a film. This clearly isn't the intention, yet no solid foundation for their relationship is ever established. In between the sex scenes are endless voiceovers, mostly from Maurice but also from Sarah, which constantly assure the audience that they are still entirely miserable. They're often detailed enough to highlight some subtle nuance of misery we might have missed along the way.Even living in London during The Blitz, Maurice finds it a simple task to ignore the war. He muses to himself, early in the film, wondering how he could feel so peaceful while such a conflict was being waged. The audience has little wonder, however, as we bear witness to Maurice repeatedly having it off with the strikingly lovely Sarah in any number of finely appointed locations. Greene's novel was written from an overtly Catholic perspective, and God plays a major role in the second half of this film. The priest Sarah visits is portrayed by Isaacs, who despite the limited role provides ample gravitas. The wonderful cast aside, the standout star of this film is the consistently reliable composer Michael Nyman, who previously scored ""The Piano"" and ""Gattaca"". His work here is a fittingly passionate, sweeping score that serves as almost another character in the film. Ultimately ""The End of the Affair"" is a serviceable romance film, yet an entirely forgettable affair (with the notable exception of the score).",3,Serviceable Yet Unremarkable Romantic Drama,1265328000,"02 5, 2010",2010,3374,"['first', 'glance', 'End', 'Affair', 'have', 'earmarks', 'classic', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'romance', 'spirit', 'Casablanca', 'film', 'promise', 'old-fashioned', 'weepy', 'love', 'story', 'superlative', 'cast', 'form', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Fiennes', 'Maurice', 'Bendix', 'novelist', 'trade', 'who', 'madly', 'love', 'Sarah', 'Moore', 'wife', 'Henry', 'Miles', 'Rea', 'title', 'subtly', 'film', 'atypical', 'route', 'sympathetically', 'focusing', 'adulterers', 'opposed', 'more', 'familiar', 'yarn', 'spurned', 'spouse', 'seething', 'film', 'based', 'off', 'tale', 'legendary', 'author', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'other', 'classics', 'Third', 'Man', 'second', 'adaptation', 'book', '1955', 'End', 'Affair', 'Unfortunately', 'strong', 'cast', 'classic', 'premise', 'are', 'undermined', 'tepid', 'screenplay', 'never', 'viewer', 'difficult', 'care', 'much', 'Maurice', 'Sarah', 'not', ""'re"", 'adulterers', 'unlikeable', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'characters.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'flashback', 'film', 'frequently', 'alternating', 'past', 'present', 'disjointed', 'narrative', 'something', 'conceit', 'initial', 'illusion', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'romance', 'something', 'more', 'complex', 'film', 'well-edited', 'sense', 'not', 'difficult', 'follow', 'often', 'film', 'will', 'retread', 'scenes', 'slightly', 'varied', 'perspective', 'executed', 'carefully', 'can', 'be', 'masterful', 'technique', 'use', 'here', 'clumsy', 'ineffectual', 'pacing', 'film', 'bore', 'awhile', 'are', 'copious', 'love-making', 'scenes', 'Maurice', 'Sarah', 'are', 'amply', 'amorous', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'drive', 'narrative', 'forward', 'relationship', 'devoid', 'real', 'pathos', 'appearing', 'instead', 'based', 'purely', 'sex', 'reality', 'suppose', 'good', 'enough', 'reason', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'intriguing', 'material', 'film', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'intention', 'yet', 'solid', 'foundation', 'relationship', 'ever', 'established', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'endless', 'voiceovers', 'mostly', 'Maurice', 'also', 'Sarah', 'constantly', 'assure', 'audience', 'are', 'still', 'entirely', 'miserable', ""'re"", 'often', 'detailed', 'enough', 'highlight', 'subtle', 'nuance', 'misery', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'way.Even', 'living', 'London', 'Blitz', 'Maurice', 'simple', 'task', 'ignore', 'war', 'early', 'film', 'wondering', 'how', 'could', 'feel', 'so', 'peaceful', 'conflict', 'was', 'being', 'waged', 'audience', 'little', 'wonder', 'however', 'bear', 'witness', 'Maurice', 'repeatedly', 'having', 'off', 'strikingly', 'lovely', 'Sarah', 'number', 'finely', 'appointed', 'locations', 'Greene', 'novel', 'was', 'written', 'overtly', 'Catholic', 'perspective', 'God', 'major', 'role', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'priest', 'Sarah', 'visits', 'portrayed', 'Isaacs', 'who', 'limited', 'role', 'ample', 'gravitas', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'aside', 'standout', 'star', 'film', 'consistently', 'reliable', 'composer', 'Michael', 'Nyman', 'who', 'previously', 'scored', 'Piano', 'Gattaca', 'work', 'here', 'fittingly', 'passionate', 'sweeping', 'score', 'almost', 'character', 'film', 'Ultimately', 'End', 'Affair', 'serviceable', 'romance', 'film', 'entirely', 'forgettable', 'affair', 'notable', 'exception', 'score']",N/A

His love of her has now turned nasty and jealous--he even spies on her to see if she has taken a new lover. Ultimately he gets a big surprise, not at all what he was expecting. I suggest you read the book, because I'd bet you'll like it.Well, because I had liked the book, when this movie was released, I enthusiastically brought my friend Marion to see it. All the subtlty of Greene was lost. The only part the scriptwriter and director latched onto was &quot;affair&quot;, so bingo! Butts, breasts galore. Heaving, hoisting. Wow, was my face red. I'm sure Marion wondered to herself whether there something about me she didn't know. Last time I'll ever get to pick the movie, I guess.This Fiennes guy, I just don't get it about him.

20012,A152C8GYY25HAH,0767832485,Matthew Horner,"[5, 6]","The End of the Affair, based on the novel by Graham Greene, is the sort of movie you don't often see any more. It is about a poignant love affair between two mature adults, one of who is married. It is about love, not about falling in and out of love. It is about the events in life that can end the affair but not the love. The movie does not succeed on every level, having at times almost the feel of a documentary, but it does succeed admirably in taking an in-depth look at a relationship.The movie starts at the end and works back and forth, but is never difficult to follow. The affair begins in London just before the start of W.W.II when successful novelist Maurice Bendrix [Ralph Fiennes] meets Sarah [Julianne Moore], wife of highly placed government official Henry Miles [Stephen Rea]. Sarah is a beautiful, intelligent woman in her 30s. Hers and Henry's marriage is one of those where love exists in a low key - neither platonic nor passionate. It is the type that lies just above a marriage of convenience. There is an immediate spark when Maurice and Sarah meet, and they soon act upon it. Henry is clueless because, lacking much sexual desire himself, he rarely sees it in other people. He also travels a great deal, and these factors allow the lovers to carry on an intimate relationship for several years. When it ends, it ends badly, as most affairs do. What is interesting here is that Maurice's logical assumption of why it ended is not the truth at all. When he finally discovers the real reason, it evokes a spirituality rarely seen in any movie, much less one about about illicit passion.The End of the Affair is a visually rich period piece. The sets, the costumes nand the photography masterfully evoke the look and feel of London in the late 1930s and early 1940s. In a brilliant use of color, the beautiful Ms. Moore is always costumed in either red or green, which makes her a stunning vision against the pastel sets and especially against the male characters, who are always dressed in dark colors.The acting is of the high caliber we have come to expect of movies produced in Great Britain. The characters speak the King's English, the dialect most easily understood by most Americans. Ms. Moore, in fact, hails from Fayetteville, North Carolina, but she sounds thoroughly English to my rather provincial ears.While it is in no way as epic [or as long!] as The English Patient, The End of the Affair is similar in tone. It should appeal to many romantics over the age of twenty-five.",4,Poignant film in the mode of 'The English Patient',1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,2513,"['End', 'Affair', 'based', 'novel', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'sort', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'more', 'poignant', 'love', 'affair', 'two', 'mature', 'adults', 'one', 'who', 'married', 'love', 'not', 'falling', 'love', 'events', 'life', 'can', 'end', 'affair', 'not', 'love', 'movie', 'not', 'succeed', 'level', 'having', 'times', 'almost', 'feel', 'documentary', 'succeed', 'admirably', 'taking', 'in-depth', 'look', 'relationship.The', 'movie', 'end', 'back', 'forth', 'never', 'difficult', 'follow', 'affair', 'London', 'just', 'start', 'W.W.II', 'when', 'successful', 'novelist', 'Maurice', 'Bendrix', '[', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', ']', 'Sarah', '[', 'Julianne', 'Moore', ']', 'wife', 'highly', 'placed', 'government', 'official', 'Henry', 'Miles', '[', 'Stephen', 'Rea', ']', 'Sarah', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'woman', '30s', 'Hers', 'Henry', 'marriage', 'one', 'where', 'love', 'low', 'key', 'platonic', 'passionate', 'type', 'just', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'immediate', 'spark', 'when', 'Maurice', 'Sarah', 'meet', 'soon', 'act', 'Henry', 'clueless', 'lacking', 'much', 'sexual', 'desire', 'rarely', 'other', 'people', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'factors', 'allow', 'lovers', 'carry', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'several', 'years', 'When', 'badly', 'most', 'affairs', 'do', 'What', 'interesting', 'here', 'Maurice', 'logical', 'assumption', 'why', 'ended', 'not', 'truth', 'When', 'finally', 'real', 'reason', 'spirituality', 'rarely', 'seen', 'movie', 'much', 'less', 'one', 'illicit', 'passion.The', 'End', 'Affair', 'visually', 'rich', 'period', 'piece', 'sets', 'costumes', 'nand', 'photography', 'masterfully', 'evoke', 'look', 'feel', 'London', 'late', '1930s', 'early', '1940s', 'brilliant', 'use', 'color', 'beautiful', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'always', 'costumed', 'red', 'green', 'stunning', 'vision', 'pastel', 'sets', 'especially', 'male', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'dressed', 'dark', 'colors.The', 'acting', 'high', 'caliber', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'movies', 'produced', 'Great', 'Britain', 'characters', 'speak', 'King', 'English', 'dialect', 'most', 'easily', 'understood', 'most', 'Americans', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'fact', 'hails', 'Fayetteville', 'North', 'Carolina', 'thoroughly', 'English', 'rather', 'provincial', 'ears.While', 'way', 'epic', '[', 'long', ']', 'English', 'Patient', 'End', 'Affair', 'similar', 'tone', 'should', 'appeal', 'many', 'romantics', 'age', 'twenty-five']",N/A

She ends their love affair mysteriously after an incident, in which Maurice nearly dies. Maurice writes a personal story of hate and jealousy. Through flash back techniques, intense loving and passionate memories, great performances and enchanting music, the audience discovers along with Maurice the reason Sarah ended their affair.Directed by Irish director Neil Jordan, who also wrote the screen play; the trio of Ralph Fiennes, Julian Moore, and Stephen Rea deliver outstanding performances.Since 1999, this movie remains one of my favorites.  Maurice's personal thoughts and struggle, the acknowledgment of God through man's weakness and desires was a creative idea of genius.

For the husband in this movie is not in need of a lover as much as a companion to ease the loneliness of  his life.Throughout this film God will court Sarah(Julianne Moore) as  vigoursly, cruely and unrelentingly as any lover might. In fact you could  argue that its the idea of God, and not the Almighty himself that fuels the  Catholic guilt of these lover and particularly Sarah who unlike Bendrix  still believes in him.This is Neil Jordans best film since the great  The Crying Game 1992. It is a masterpiece of structure where some scenes  are played over again after we have learned new information, and while we  may have shared the cynical viewpoint of Muarice Bendrix the first time we  see these scenes played out, when we see them again, we like the Bendrix  share in the guilt. Indeed this film is first and foremost about guilt. All  the colors in the film are variations on green and brown, creating a mood  as morose as our lead characers.There are scenes of deeply erotic  lovemaking. All the more erotic because of the guilt the lovers feel. I've  always felt there was somehow a link between sex and religion beyond the  fact that most religions consider it a sin. Sex is simaltanously filthy and  the purest of things, and that I think is why most Religions adhere to a  rigid stance on it, so that they can maintain a clear black and white  standard of right and wrong, to attract simpltons into the fold.I have  not been so moved by a film since Terrance Malicks The Thin Red Line and  although I thought I'd never use this word in one of these Amazon reviews,  but at times this film is simply &quot;devestating&quot;.A cynic  looking at this film might find it completely contrived, as events flow  almost mercilessly to the film's shattering end. But anyone who can resist  the site of a limping Ralph Fiennes chasing the carriage of Julianne Moore  in the rain to Michael Nymann's magnifecent score must indeed have a cold  heart.I wouldn't dare spoil the ending except to say that I don't  agree with the faith regained at the end of this film.

This film, while not blowing away the box office upon it's U.S. release, certainly encompasses three sensational performances, a director who truly keeps to the spirit of the written word, cinematography that plays integral part of the story itself and a score that haunts with subtle yet vibrant beauty.While no one can deny that Julianne Moore is the centerpiece of the tale as Sarah, Ralph Fiennes and Stephen Rea are also to be lauded for their interpretations of Bendrix and Henry respectively.  Fiennes, in a role of quiet intensity and soft-pitched rage takes us into the psyche of Bendrix and gives us perhaps the best visual image as to what life must have been been for Graham Greene himself during the affair that marked his life. Rea as the cuckhold Henry is, as has been written a dullard through and through, but what makes his interpretation noble is the fact that he is well aware of it at every instant.  It's obvious that his marriage to Sarah was at all moments a marriage of convenience that hoped for something better, but that never truly reached the pinnacle of love.The tale begins with Bendrix's &quot;diary of hate&quot; and never loses that. Yes, he hates and never stops hating but as a constant,  love is tempered and fed by the fuel of such fires.  Ultimately, it is fate that becomes the undoing and the true end of the affair.",5,Mature Love for a Anxious Audience,978652800,"01 5, 2001",2001,1539,"['times', 'youth', 'galore', 'Generation', 'X', 'indeed', 'rare', 'come', 'find', 'love', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'labeled', '*mature*', 'have', 'that', 'not', 'be', 'overstatement', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'blowing', 'away', 'box', 'office', 'U.S.', 'release', 'certainly', 'three', 'sensational', 'performances', 'director', 'who', 'truly', 'spirit', 'written', 'word', 'cinematography', 'integral', 'part', 'story', 'score', 'subtle', 'yet', 'vibrant', 'one', 'can', 'deny', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'centerpiece', 'tale', 'Sarah', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'are', 'also', 'be', 'lauded', 'interpretations', 'Bendrix', 'Henry', 'respectively', 'Fiennes', 'role', 'quiet', 'intensity', 'soft-pitched', 'rage', 'psyche', 'Bendrix', 'perhaps', 'best', 'visual', 'image', 'what', 'life', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'been', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'affair', 'marked', 'life', 'Rea', 'cuckhold', 'Henry', 'been', 'written', 'dullard', 'what', 'interpretation', 'noble', 'fact', 'well', 'aware', 'instant', 'obvious', 'marriage', 'Sarah', 'was', 'moments', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'hoped', 'something', 'better', 'never', 'truly', 'reached', 'pinnacle', 'love.The', 'tale', 'Bendrix', 'quot', 'diary', 'hate', 'quot', 'never', 'Yes', 'never', 'stops', 'hating', 'constant', 'love', 'tempered', 'fed', 'fuel', 'such', 'fires', 'Ultimately', 'fate', 'undoing', 'true', 'end', 'affair']",N/A

20024,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0767832485,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","The End of the Affair (Neil Jordan, 1999)I don't think there's a single person on earth who hasn't seen a Neil Jordan film by this time. The man's popularity and influence are so far-reaching that it sometimes seems you could travel to the wilds of Timbuktu and hear people talking about the twist ending of The Crying Game. The man is a master, there's no getting around it. So why is that you can hand him one of the finest novels to come out of England during the twentieth century and a cast with four of Britain's heaviest hitters in its four lead roles and still come up with such a pointless, meandering film?To be fair to Jordan (if that's possible), The End of the Affair-- first filmed in 1955 with Van Johnson and Peter Cushing in the roles played here by Ralph Fiennes and Stephen Rea, respectively-- is an astonishingly difficult novel, and its somewhat unconventional structure (the climax comes just under halfway through) makes the transition to film a nightmare if the director focuses on the wrong parts. And for the first hour of this movie that's exactly what Jordan does. While any excuse to show off Julianne Moore in as little clothing as possible is certainly worthwhile, there doesn't seem to be any other reason for its existence. She has more onscreen charisma in a bulky trenchcoat for the ninety seconds she appears in Chicago Cab.It's at the novel's climax where the Jordan magic falls into place. Starting at that point and travelling through the last hour of this film, it's riveting. Everything comes together. (Julianne Moore keeps her clothes on. This may not be coincidence.) The chemistry that was nonexistint between Fiennes and Rea is suddenly there and powerful. Ian Hart, last seen as the long-suffering son in Longitude, starts making the audience realize what an incredible depth of talent he has. In other words, the last hour of this film is brilliant. Too bad most casual viewers won't survive the first hour. ** 1/2",3,Could have been excellent,980294400,"01 24, 2001",2001,1962,"['End', 'Affair', 'Neil', 'Jordan', '1999', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'person', 'earth', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'film', 'time', 'man', 'popularity', 'influence', 'are', 'so', 'far-reaching', 'sometimes', 'could', 'travel', 'wilds', 'Timbuktu', 'hear', 'people', 'talking', 'twist', 'ending', 'Crying', 'Game', 'man', 'master', 'getting', 'So', 'why', 'can', 'hand', 'one', 'finest', 'novels', 'come', 'England', 'twentieth', 'century', 'cast', 'four', 'Britain', 'heaviest', 'hitters', 'four', 'lead', 'roles', 'still', 'come', 'up', 'pointless', 'meandering', 'film', 'be', 'fair', 'Jordan', 'possible', 'End', 'Affair', 'first', 'filmed', '1955', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'roles', 'played', 'here', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'respectively', 'astonishingly', 'difficult', 'novel', 'somewhat', 'unconventional', 'structure', 'climax', 'just', 'halfway', 'transition', 'film', 'nightmare', 'director', 'wrong', 'parts', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'Jordan', 'excuse', 'show', 'off', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'as', 'little', 'clothing', 'possible', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'other', 'reason', 'existence', 'more', 'onscreen', 'charisma', 'bulky', 'trenchcoat', 'ninety', 'Chicago', 'Cab.It', 'novel', 'climax', 'where', 'Jordan', 'magic', 'place', 'Starting', 'point', 'travelling', 'last', 'hour', 'film', 'riveting', 'Everything', 'together', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'clothes', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'coincidence', 'chemistry', 'was', 'nonexistint', 'Fiennes', 'Rea', 'suddenly', 'powerful', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'last', 'seen', 'long-suffering', 'son', 'Longitude', 'making', 'audience', 'realize', 'what', 'incredible', 'depth', 'talent', 'other', 'words', 'last', 'hour', 'film', 'brilliant', 'Too', 'bad', 'most', 'casual', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'survive', 'first', 'hour', '1/2']",N/A
20025,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0767832485,Roland E. Zwick,"[93, 98]","One of the great joys in movie watching lies in stumbling across films that, by their very nature, should be nothing more than clich&eacute;d, hackneyed versions of stories we have seen a thousand times before yet, somehow,  through the insightfulness of their creators, manage to illuminate those  tales in ways that are wholly new and unexpected.  Such is the case with  Neil Jordan's ""The End of the Affair,"" a film that in its bare boned  outlining would promise to be nothing more than a conventional,  three-handkerchief weepie centered around the hoary issue of romantic  infidelity, but which emerges, instead, as a beautiful and moving  meditation on the overwhelming force jealousy, love, commitment and passion  can exert on our lives.Ralph Fiennes stars as Maurice Bendrix, a British  writer living in 1940's London, who has an affair with Sarah Miles  (Julianne Moore), the wife of Maurice's friend, Henry (Stephen Rea).  Based  on a Graham Greene novel, the film achieves far greater intellectual and  emotional depth than this skeletal outline would indicate.  Part of the  success rests in the fact that both the original author and the adapter,  writer/director Neil Jordan, have devised a multi-level scenario that  utilizes a number of narrative techniques as the means of revealing crucial  information to the audience regarding both the plot and the characters.  For instance, the film travels fluidly back and forth in time, spanning the  decade of the 1940's, from the initial meeting between Bendrix and Sarah in  1939, through the horrendous bombings of London during World War II to the  ""present"" time of the post-war British world.  This allows the authors to  reveal the details of the affair slowly, enhanced by the even more striking  technique of having the events viewed from the entirely different  viewpoints of the two main characters involved.  ""Rashomon"" - like, we  first see the affair through the prism of Bendrix's limited perspective,  only to discover, after he has confiscated Sarah's diary, that he (and  consequently we) have been utterly mistaken as to the personal attributes  and moral quality of Sarah all along.  Thus, as an added irony, Bendrix  discovers that he has been obsessing over a woman he ""loves"" but, in  reality, knows little about.The authors also enhance the depth of the  story through their examination of TWO men struggling with their  overwhelming jealousy for the same woman and the complex interrelationships  that are set up as a result.  In fact, the chief distinction of this film  is the way it manages to lay bare the souls of all three of these  fascinating characters, making them complex, enigmatic and  three-dimensional human beings with which, in their universality, we can  all identify.  Bendrix struggles with his raging romantic passions, his  obsessive jealousy for the woman he can't possess and his lack of belief in  God, the last of which faces its ultimate challenge at the end.  Sarah  struggles with the lack of passion she finds in the man she has married but  cannot love as more than a friend, juxtaposed to the intense love she feels  for this man she knows she can never fully have.  In addition, she finds  herself strangely faithful, if not to the two men in her life, at least to  two crucial commitments (one to her wedding vows and one to God) yet unable  to fully understand why.  Henry struggles with his inadequacies as a lover  and the strange possessiveness that nevertheless holds sway over him.  Even  the minor characters are fascinating.  Particularly intriguing is the  private investigator who becomes strangely enmeshed in the entire business  as both Bendrix and Henry set him out to record Sarah's activities and  whereabouts, a man full of compassion for the people whom he is, by the  nature of his profession, supposed to view from a position of coldhearted  objectivity.  (One plot flaw does, however, show up here:  why would this  man, whose job it is to spy on unsuspecting people for his clients, employ  a boy to help him who sports a very distinctive birthmark on one side of  his face?).""The End of the Affair"" would not be the noteworthy triumph  it is without the stellar, subtly nuanced  performances of its three main  stars.  In addition, as director, Jordan, especially in the second half,  achieves a lyricism rare in modern filmmaking.  Through a fluidly gliding  camera and a mesmerizing musical score, Jordan lifts the film almost to the  level of cinematic poetry; we sit transfixed by the emotional richness and  romantic purity of the experience.  ""The End of the Affair"" takes its place  alongside ""Brief Encounter"" and ""Two For the Road"" as one of the very best  studies of a romantic relationship ever put on film.",5,beautiful romantic tale,964396800,"07 24, 2000",2000,4761,"['One', 'great', 'joys', 'movie', 'watching', 'stumbling', 'films', 'very', 'nature', 'should', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'hackneyed', 'versions', 'stories', 'have', 'seen', 'thousand', 'times', 'before', 'yet', 'somehow', 'insightfulness', 'creators', 'manage', 'illuminate', 'tales', 'ways', 'are', 'wholly', 'new', 'unexpected', 'Such', 'case', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'End', 'Affair', 'film', 'bare', 'boned', 'outlining', 'would', 'promise', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'conventional', 'three-handkerchief', 'weepie', 'centered', 'hoary', 'issue', 'romantic', 'infidelity', 'instead', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'meditation', 'overwhelming', 'force', 'jealousy', 'love', 'commitment', 'passion', 'can', 'exert', 'lives.Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Maurice', 'Bendrix', 'British', 'writer', 'living', '1940', 'London', 'who', 'affair', 'Sarah', 'Miles', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'wife', 'Maurice', 'friend', 'Henry', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Based', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'novel', 'film', 'far', 'greater', 'intellectual', 'emotional', 'depth', 'skeletal', 'outline', 'would', 'indicate', 'Part', 'success', 'fact', 'original', 'author', 'adapter', 'writer/director', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'have', 'devised', 'multi-level', 'scenario', 'number', 'narrative', 'techniques', 'means', 'revealing', 'crucial', 'information', 'audience', 'regarding', 'plot', 'characters', 'instance', 'film', 'travels', 'fluidly', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'spanning', 'decade', '1940', 'initial', 'meeting', 'Bendrix', 'Sarah', '1939', 'horrendous', 'bombings', 'London', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'present', 'time', 'post-war', 'British', 'world', 'authors', 'reveal', 'details', 'affair', 'slowly', 'enhanced', 'even', 'more', 'striking', 'technique', 'having', 'events', 'viewed', 'entirely', 'different', 'viewpoints', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'involved', 'Rashomon', 'first', 'see', 'affair', 'prism', 'Bendrix', 'limited', 'perspective', 'only', 'discover', 'confiscated', 'Sarah', 'diary', 'consequently', 'have', 'been', 'utterly', 'mistaken', 'personal', 'attributes', 'moral', 'quality', 'Sarah', 'along', 'Thus', 'added', 'irony', 'Bendrix', 'been', 'obsessing', 'woman', 'reality', 'little', 'about.The', 'authors', 'also', 'enhance', 'depth', 'story', 'examination', 'TWO', 'men', 'struggling', 'overwhelming', 'jealousy', 'same', 'woman', 'complex', 'interrelationships', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'result', 'fact', 'chief', 'distinction', 'film', 'way', 'lay', 'bare', 'souls', 'three', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'making', 'complex', 'enigmatic', 'three-dimensional', 'human', 'beings', 'universality', 'can', 'identify', 'Bendrix', 'raging', 'romantic', 'passions', 'obsessive', 'jealousy', 'woman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possess', 'lack', 'belief', 'God', 'last', 'ultimate', 'challenge', 'end', 'Sarah', 'lack', 'passion', 'man', 'married', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'more', 'friend', 'juxtaposed', 'intense', 'love', 'man', 'can', 'never', 'fully', 'have', 'addition', 'strangely', 'faithful', 'not', 'two', 'men', 'life', 'least', 'two', 'crucial', 'commitments', 'one', 'wedding', 'vows', 'one', 'God', 'yet', 'unable', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'Henry', 'inadequacies', 'lover', 'strange', 'possessiveness', 'nevertheless', 'sway', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'fascinating', 'Particularly', 'intriguing', 'private', 'investigator', 'who', 'strangely', 'enmeshed', 'entire', 'business', 'Bendrix', 'Henry', 'set', 'out', 'record', 'Sarah', 'activities', 'whereabouts', 'man', 'full', 'compassion', 'people', 'whom', 'nature', 'profession', 'supposed', 'view', 'position', 'coldhearted', 'objectivity', 'One', 'plot', 'flaw', 'however', 'show', 'up', 'here', 'why', 'would', 'man', 'job', 'spy', 'unsuspecting', 'people', 'clients', 'employ', 'boy', 'help', 'who', 'sports', 'very', 'distinctive', 'birthmark', 'one', 'side', 'face', 'End', 'Affair', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'noteworthy', 'triumph', 'stellar', 'subtly', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'three', 'main', 'stars', 'addition', 'director', 'Jordan', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'lyricism', 'rare', 'modern', 'filmmaking', 'fluidly', 'gliding', 'camera', 'mesmerizing', 'musical', 'score', 'Jordan', 'film', 'almost', 'level', 'cinematic', 'poetry', 'sit', 'transfixed', 'emotional', 'richness', 'romantic', 'purity', 'experience', 'End', 'Affair', 'place', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'Two', 'Road', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'studies', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'ever', 'put', 'film']",N/A

20027,A302QBBIPHAYSG,0767832485,Stephenie,"[4, 4]","I love films which unfold complexities slowly, that use color with deep intention, and don't rely on words to say everything that must be said.To fit into alloted time, I feel that you must allow a film like this to stand on its own. Many adjustments were made to the story, and what eventually emerges is, to me, even more cohesive and personal.One thing I particularly love about The End of the Affair, is the color pallette and sharp attention to clothing. I love Sarah's red suits, her green jacket, her hair (carefully suited to the time), and the way the colors stand out, but with subtlety, from every scene that she stands in until her character begins to fade.This movie permanently affected my aesthetic sensibilities.The *most* affecting aspect of the movie for me however, was being able to deeply relate to the character of Sarah, as I think many people can. Most of us have our superstitions, even when we work to keep them subdued, and certainly a seemingly ""miraculous experience,"" or great trauma (they usually go together don't they?) can bring those things to the surface.I thought that the Bendrix and Henry dynamic that played out in the film was fascinating. It created a contrast between two ways of living really: One figure, content to live on a straight line, climbing little by little with bits of satisfaction but no passion, and the other all passion and anger and intensity. Henry, in a way, created the passion Sarah felt for Maurice. He bottled her up and placed her on a shelf where she simmered, and I think the ""vulgar sex scenes"" as some called them, are extraordinarily necessary if you want to understand the emotions going on. I suppose one can debate the manner in which they're filmed, but I don't think the movie would have been nearly as strong without them.Then again, Sarah's religious devotion followed her commitment to Henry, which before the vow she seemed to have no intention of lessening, so you also see that she was more than the sensual person that she was with Maurice, she was also the practical wife. Neither was a role she was playing.Every central character in this film, is a dichotomy, and more than that, they are wonderfully and spectacularly flawed, which certainly is the core of Graham Greene's insightful and philosophic writing.This is a film rich in unanswerable questions, and contains brilliant use of perspective.",5,"""Goodness has so little fictional value""",1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,2386,"['love', 'films', 'unfold', 'complexities', 'slowly', 'use', 'color', 'deep', 'intention', 'do', ""n't"", 'rely', 'words', 'say', 'everything', 'must', 'be', 'said.To', 'fit', 'alloted', 'time', 'feel', 'must', 'allow', 'film', 'stand', 'own', 'Many', 'adjustments', 'were', 'made', 'story', 'what', 'eventually', 'even', 'more', 'cohesive', 'personal.One', 'thing', 'particularly', 'love', 'End', 'Affair', 'color', 'pallette', 'sharp', 'attention', 'clothing', 'love', 'Sarah', 'red', 'suits', 'green', 'jacket', 'hair', 'carefully', 'suited', 'time', 'way', 'colors', 'stand', 'out', 'subtlety', 'scene', 'character', 'fade.This', 'movie', 'permanently', 'affected', 'aesthetic', 'sensibilities.The', '*most*', 'affecting', 'aspect', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'being', 'able', 'deeply', 'relate', 'character', 'Sarah', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'Most', 'have', 'superstitions', 'even', 'when', 'work', 'keep', 'subdued', 'certainly', 'seemingly', 'miraculous', 'experience', 'great', 'trauma', 'usually', 'go', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'can', 'bring', 'things', 'surface.I', 'thought', 'Bendrix', 'Henry', 'dynamic', 'played', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'fascinating', 'created', 'contrast', 'two', 'ways', 'living', 'really', 'One', 'figure', 'content', 'live', 'straight', 'line', 'climbing', 'little', 'little', 'bits', 'satisfaction', 'passion', 'other', 'passion', 'anger', 'intensity', 'Henry', 'way', 'created', 'passion', 'Sarah', 'felt', 'Maurice', 'bottled', 'up', 'placed', 'shelf', 'where', 'simmered', 'think', 'vulgar', 'sex', 'scenes', 'called', 'are', 'extraordinarily', 'necessary', 'want', 'understand', 'emotions', 'going', 'suppose', 'one', 'can', 'debate', 'manner', ""'re"", 'filmed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'strong', 'them.Then', 'again', 'Sarah', 'religious', 'devotion', 'followed', 'commitment', 'Henry', 'vow', 'seemed', 'have', 'intention', 'lessening', 'also', 'see', 'was', 'more', 'sensual', 'person', 'was', 'Maurice', 'was', 'also', 'practical', 'wife', 'was', 'role', 'was', 'playing.Every', 'central', 'character', 'film', 'dichotomy', 'more', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'spectacularly', 'flawed', 'certainly', 'core', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'insightful', 'philosophic', 'writing.This', 'film', 'rich', 'unanswerable', 'questions', 'contains', 'brilliant', 'use', 'perspective']",N/A

20029,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,0767832485,T.M. Reader,"[7, 9]","Not long ago I read Graham Greene's wonderful, ""The End of the Affair"".  I was so impressed that I sought out a film version, and was again captivated with the 1955 production starring Van Johnson, Deborah Kerr, and Basil Rathbone.  Loving the story and wanting more, I obtained the 1999 version starring Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore, and Stephen Rea.  What a disappointment.  Typical modern Hollywood alteration and cheapening of a great story and truth.If I may expand a bit, in the order of least importance to greatest importance:  Julianne Moore is only minimally attractive, and her flat acting performance in this role makes her even less so.  The sex and nudity was gratuitous.  (Wrapping this piece in a Graham Greene cloak does not make it less the soft core presentation that it is).  The WWII England aura seems to have been diminished.  Perhaps when the original film was made, memories were fresh . . . now they have faded (like this film).  And, finally and most importantly . . .Graham Greene was a spiritual man, in his own fashion.  He held a complex but serious theology, which was usually expressed in his written work.  This film version, however, must have him figuratively rolling over in his grave.  The ending of the story has been substantially altered.  In Greene's original version, God's hand moves mysteriously, complexly, but benevolently.  The heroine makes painful but righteous ultimate decisions.  In this modern adaptation, all is changed.

His adaptation of what is perhaps Graham Greene's greatest (and most autobiographical) novel is one of the most moving depictions of God and faith that can be found in any motion picture. The fact the movie can grapple with God and faith in such an wrenching manner, and at the same time be such an adult, ambiguous and intelligent feature makes it even more profound. The movie is remarkably intelligent. It also has an intricate time shifting structure that is so well crafted one doesn't even give a thought as to just how difficult a feat Jordon pulled of narratively. The film also works as a great mystery: Why did Julianne Moore's character break off her affair with her lover, and who is the mysterious third man she is seeing and whom Ralph Fiennes hates so much? Top notch in every regard, from the filmmaking, the beautiful score, and three terrific performances from Moore, Fiennes and Stephen Rea (particularly good.) It is rather awe inspiring to note that Moore, who here plays a very good woman who gradually becomes a saint, filmed this movie back to back with MAGNOLIA, where she plays such a ravaged, crazed woman completely the opposite from the character in this movie.

Each of  the three leads is locked by their respective world views into senses of  propriety that largely prevent them from communicating.  They all believe  they are acting in the right way, according to their own system of beliefs,  and so feel no need to explain their actions.  Consequently, very little  actually *happens* in the film.  It is a film ultimately about reactions.  And that's fine stuff for a novel, like the Graham Greene basis for the  screenplay, but it hardly makes for a satisfying night at the movies.It's made particularly unsatisfying because we're never really  introduced to the characters.  We don't know why Julianne Moore's character  married Stephen Rae's.  And we need to know. There's certainly nothing in  the present of their relationship which explains why they would have  married.  They seem to have nothing in common, and Stephen Rea acts so  completely joyless throughout, it's hard to see why they'd even be good  friends.  We likewise don't see the root of Ralph Fiennes' atheism, nor  indeed Julianne Moore's Christianity.To be sure, this is somewhat  faithful to the novel, which has all events transpiring before the eyes of  Fiennes' character, who doubles as the story's narrator.  Given that, it  makes sense that there would be a certain incompleteness of vision about  the other characters.  But the dearth of exposition in this film is far  more than can be explained by narrative perspective.  It's simply missing,  and there's no good  reason for that.Without that vital character  background, we don't care about them--and we're certainly unimpressed by  the moral their story aims to teach.  In fact, the groundwork laid for that  conclusion is so sparse, and the conclusion itself so controversial, that  we're left feeling as if the filmmakers have committed a form of gratuitous  blasphemy.(DVD NOTES: This product has an above average collection of  extras, including two audio commentaries, a making-of featurette and an  isolated music score.  The featurette is rather forgettable, but the audio  commentaries are significant and interesting-more engrossing than the film  itself.IMPORTANT NOTE:  There's a double-feature version of this product  that has both the original film and this remake on it.

20033,A2ONX15N6TWDR,0767832485,Vincenzo L.,"[2, 2]","This is an engrossing tale of love, passion and betrayal involving three star-crossed lovers. Maurice Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes) is a man haunted by jealousy and pain over an affair he had with the wife of one of his friends, Henry Miles (Stephen Rea). The affair has been over for two years when a chance encounter with Miles takes Bendrix to his house where he once again encounters Sarah (Julianne Moore). The obsession for her returns when Henry tells him that he suspects that Sarah is having an affair. At hearing this Maurice gets jealous, thinking that he has been replaced as her paramour. What follows is a complex and tangled web of suspicion, jealousy and dolor.This is a wonderfully complicated story that opens slowly like a flower. It is a first person narrative delivered by Bendrix and it gets more intriguing as the film progresses. The use of flashbacks is subtlety effective, where the realizations about misinterpretations come not from the dialogue, but from seeing the same scene from two perspectives. The love scenes are sensuously done and the general tone of the film is poignant and sensitive.The film was nicely photographed with various filters to give it an old feel without losing the richness. Director Neil Jordan did a fine job of giving the film a genuine look of the period with proper English costumes from the 1940's.Ralph Fiennes was excellent as the jealous lover. He played the character as civilized and staid with molten lava just beneath the surface. He was masterful at conveying strong emotion with a sideways glance or hand gesture without losing his composure.Julianne Moore has added another fabulous dramatic performance to her resume as Sarah. She played the part with fatalistic passion, victimized by vortex of events she felt powerless to control.Stephen Rea also shined as the impassive cuckold. Rea tends to be very understated in his portrayals, often too much so. But he was the perfect choice for the hapless Miles; so intellectual, withdrawn and defenseless. His phlegmatic response upon being confronted by Bendrix about their affair, showed a resigned helplessness that was both pathetic and believable.I enjoyed this film immensely and award if four out of five possible stars. It is finespun yet powerful. It takes its time unfolding, so if you like pace this film might test your patience.

20034,A31D8QKJXU93BT,0767832485,"Vince Perrin ""Byline""","[10, 11]","Irish director Neil Jordan has made a mature movie for adults about an affair between the wife of a British diplomat and an athiestic novelist. No less a character than God Himself performs two miracles to resolve the plot. It's based on an acclaimed semi-autobiographical novel by Graham Greene told in two parts: the diary of the novelist, baffled by her ending of their affair, and the diary of the wife, explaining why she did it. Both accounts are told side by side, moving back and forth between wartime London and the postwar 1950s as the end of the affair and reason for it are revealed.This is no ordinary adultery. It's the blitz and bombs are falling nearby when the novelist's apartment is hit during their lovemaking and she sees that he is dead. A lapsed Catholic, she promises to leave him forever if God lets him live --- just as he walks in the door. To her lover and husband, it appears she is seeing someone else and together they hire a detective to identify him. After she kisses away a boy's birthmark, they are stunned to learn their rival is God. The novelist transfers his hatred of an unknown lover to an unknown God. Jordan's few changes in the narrative actually enhance the film, one of the best screen adaptations of the oft-adapted Greene.Jordan's casting is usually so adroit that Julianne Moore, the Chicago-born New York actress, at first seems an odd choice for the wife in this all-British cast, there being no dearth of fine English actresses. Moore gets by on sheer skill and luminosity. Ralph Fiennes, Stephen Rea and Ian Hart are pitch-perfect as the novelist, husband and detective. All four play this somber chamber piece like a string quartet. You may recall an earlier 1950s version, following publication of the book. It starred Deborah Kerr and Van Johnson (yes!), who was turned into an American reporter.
