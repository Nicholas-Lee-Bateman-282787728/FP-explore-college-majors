It seemed to be cheaply made and the story didn't hold their attention for very long.  They love barbies and we thought it would be nice for a movie but I really can't say it was worth the money.,3,The girls were not that impressed!!,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,261,"['movie', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'even', '4', '6', 'year', 'old', 'seemed', 'be', 'cheaply', 'made', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'attention', 'very', 'long', 'love', 'barbies', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'movie', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'worth', 'money']",N/A

1606049,A3LNU3T5H9OMWC,B00A5VZ392,P. Romance,"[1, 1]","I loved the original Swan Princess.  The 2nd and 3rd got a once over but that was it.  However, as I was passing a $4 bin at Best Buy, this beaut caught my eye and decided to give it a whirl.  After the credits rolled, I would say this movie should've been a rental and not a keeper.Following the current trends, Swan Princess is in CG in their latest installment.  I have to say it was an overall decent facsimile to the cartoon version.  It was almost on par with the Barbie movies except for the minor flaws of the eyes and some awkwardly drawn extras.  Still, I think they should've stick to the original animation and not changed the series' looks.  It lacked the charm.  Next, the music wasn't memorable either.  The songs were mostly traditional Christmas songs with 2 new songs thrown into the fray.  The singing was well done but forgettable.  The dance routines felt a little too modern for the era.  And why wasn't Odette and her gang given more song time?  They always had the best songs.  Finally, the main thing that brought the movie down was the return of Rothbert's ghost.  Really?  It's like beating a dead horse.  He wasn't unique and just rehashed his old moves.  What a waste of space.  On the other hand, why was Derek and Odette relegated as side characters?  They were overshadowed by Rothbert and the Christmas feud.  Derek and Odette felt like an afterthought and their only major contribution was the ending.  Not everything was bad.  The plot was decent and entertaining.  I like the traditions and the theme of Christmas was portrayed well.  The returning cast of characters were the same always.  Overall, I liked the idea of the movie but execution could've been improved.Overall, this was decent movie to watch but definitely not on par as its predecessors.  If you can, I highly recommend watching it before purchasing.  This will definitely be a hit or miss.",3,Should've Been a Rental,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,1892,"['loved', 'original', 'Swan', 'Princess', '2nd', '3rd', 'got', 'once', 'was', 'However', 'was', 'passing', '4', 'bin', 'Best', 'Buy', 'beaut', 'caught', 'eye', 'decided', 'give', 'whirl', 'credits', 'rolled', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rental', 'not', 'keeper.Following', 'current', 'trends', 'Swan', 'Princess', 'CG', 'latest', 'installment', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'overall', 'decent', 'facsimile', 'cartoon', 'version', 'was', 'almost', 'par', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'minor', 'flaws', 'eyes', 'awkwardly', 'drawn', 'extras', 'Still', 'think', 'should', ""'ve"", 'stick', 'original', 'animation', 'not', 'changed', 'series', 'looks', 'lacked', 'charm', 'Next', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'either', 'songs', 'were', 'mostly', 'traditional', 'Christmas', 'songs', '2', 'new', 'songs', 'thrown', 'fray', 'singing', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'forgettable', 'dance', 'routines', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'modern', 'era', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'Odette', 'gang', 'given', 'more', 'song', 'time', 'always', 'had', 'best', 'songs', 'Finally', 'main', 'thing', 'brought', 'movie', 'down', 'was', 'return', 'Rothbert', 'ghost', 'Really', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse', 'was', ""n't"", 'unique', 'just', 'rehashed', 'old', 'moves', 'What', 'waste', 'space', 'other', 'hand', 'why', 'was', 'Derek', 'Odette', 'relegated', 'side', 'characters', 'were', 'overshadowed', 'Rothbert', 'Christmas', 'feud', 'Derek', 'Odette', 'felt', 'afterthought', 'only', 'major', 'contribution', 'was', 'ending', 'Not', 'everything', 'was', 'bad', 'plot', 'was', 'decent', 'entertaining', 'traditions', 'theme', 'Christmas', 'was', 'portrayed', 'well', 'returning', 'cast', 'characters', 'were', 'same', 'always', 'Overall', 'liked', 'idea', 'movie', 'execution', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'improved.Overall', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'watch', 'definitely', 'not', 'par', 'predecessors', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'purchasing', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'hit', 'miss']",N/A
