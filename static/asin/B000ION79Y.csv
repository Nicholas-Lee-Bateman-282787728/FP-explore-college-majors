Said aliens revealed only by their occasionally sideways blinking eyes and odd bits of wushu style wire work. All really low budget and I suspect a bit of a pile of steaming stinky as our man Steve is so laid back he's practically comatose and his action hero skit isn't helped by the spare tyre he's acquired over recent years. He clearly isn't bothereing, looks like he can't wait to hit the doughnut shop with his police buddies.Then to cap it all after completion the producers decide to rework it as a modern terrorist movie about a spectacular drug plot, only there are a few MAJOR problems :-1) New plot doesn't make any sense at all.2) Alien special effects including sideways eyeblink left in, one hell of a narcotic.3) New plot dialogue dubbed in by somebody who sounds almost entirely unlike Seagal, presumably cheaper and it really sucks big time.4) Stupid continuity errors with fight wounds flipping from right side of victims chest to left then back again. It's also glaringly obvious to the casual viewer, this is not nerd stuff. Failure to pick it up is symptomatic of this slipshod, bone idle, crappy production.If you want an example of how not to make a movie fine buy it.

1022109,A3P8KV8AD1I3O7,B000ION79Y,Joseph K. Bagdonas,"[3, 4]","I'm in total agreement with other reviews read regarding this movie! I think Steven Segal has seen his days and should have given up movie making a long time ago. His last few releases were pretty bad, but this one was the worst I've seen! He was never much of an actor to begin with, but as an action movie fan, I had purchased all of his movies. This one will be my last!Recent releases shows that he is doing less and less 'acting' (if you even want to call it acting), looking like he has gained 50 pounds, trying to cover it up with his long trench coats, unable to do 'any' of his own stunts anymore. What is even worse is that it is so obvious! You would think that with today's special effects, cameras, and other means, they could make a movie where this isn't so obvious.Steven Segal had already proven that he can beat up on women, for those that didn't hear about his domestic battery charge from the past, but it would seem that he can't even beat up on the 'bad guys' anymore! Thanks goodness for stunt doubles!I would tend to guess that the biggest part of the budget for this movie, (besides his salary), was for stunt doubles that has to do all his work for him these days. I guess he figures that just his name is going to carry him into more movie making... not after this movie!His status as an 'actor' is such that his movies aren't even hitting the theaters. They go straight from poor editing and the cutting room floor to DVD.And this movie should have stayed on the cutting room floor! Not only did the plot of the movie suck, but it was hard to follow, and I would say that a third to half of the movie had that dubbed voice issue that other reviewers commented on. And it wasn't even close! I guess there wasn't enough room in the budget to hire a good impersonator...I also agree with the comment being the entire movie being shot in such a dark setting. Where they trying to save money on lighting, or covering up for Steven Segal's weight gain, and the use of a lot of stunt doubles?Then there is Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, the distributor of this DVD, that I had talked to personally. Who at Sony decided to even accept the distribution of this so-called movie? Who ever it was, should be fired!They commented that they received countless complaints about this movie already. That the dubbed voice of Steven Segal was in no way any part of Sony's involvement in this movie. That it was the decision of the producers and director of the movie to release it as it is, a poor quality, badly made movie that was only going to sell because it had a picture of Steven Segal on the cover.I got the impression that Sony will eventually drop distribution of this title like a hot potato, so check out the $5.99 bins at Wal-mart if you really want this title, as it probably won't be in print very long! Personally, if I had seen it before I spent $20.00 for it, I wouldn't have even bought it at $5.99.It's no wonder that all his new releases are never discounted like other new releases that hit the store shelves on Tuesdays. He has no market potential any more.To Steven Segal, GIVE IT UP! You're a 'has been' that can't realize that your time is past. Oh... and by the way, why don't you take some of that money you milked off those people that bought this 'dog', and get a haircut! That rat's nest hanging down the back of your neck 'really' looks stupid, and needs to get chopped off! And save up some of that money for a larger trench coat... it looks like you'll be needing it. The one you have been wearing isn't covering it all up anymore!I think the biggest problem with Steven Segal is that he has been playing such roles for so long, I actually think he believes he some sort of indestructible, militaristic, C.I.A., super spook!",1,"Don't buy it, don't even waste your time or money renting it!",1166140800,"12 15, 2006",2006,3771,"[""'m"", 'total', 'agreement', 'other', 'reviews', 'read', 'regarding', 'movie', 'think', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'seen', 'days', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'movie', 'making', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'last', 'few', 'releases', 'were', 'pretty', 'bad', 'one', 'was', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'never', 'much', 'actor', 'begin', 'action', 'movie', 'fan', 'had', 'purchased', 'movies', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'Recent', 'releases', 'doing', 'less', 'less', ""'acting"", 'even', 'want', 'call', 'acting', 'looking', 'gained', '50', 'pounds', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'long', 'trench', 'coats', 'unable', 'do', ""'any"", ""'"", 'own', 'stunts', 'anymore', 'What', 'even', 'worse', 'so', 'obvious', 'would', 'think', 'today', 'special', 'effects', 'cameras', 'other', 'means', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'where', ""n't"", 'so', 'obvious.Steven', 'Segal', 'had', 'already', 'proven', 'can', 'beat', 'up', 'women', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'domestic', 'battery', 'charge', 'past', 'would', 'seem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'beat', 'up', ""'bad"", 'guys', 'anymore', 'Thanks', 'goodness', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'would', 'tend', 'guess', 'biggest', 'part', 'budget', 'movie', 'salary', 'was', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'do', 'work', 'days', 'guess', 'just', 'name', 'going', 'carry', 'more', 'movie', 'making', 'not', 'movie', 'status', ""'actor"", 'such', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'hitting', 'theaters', 'go', 'straight', 'poor', 'editing', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'DVD.And', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'plot', 'movie', 'suck', 'was', 'hard', 'follow', 'would', 'say', 'third', 'half', 'movie', 'had', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'issue', 'other', 'reviewers', 'commented', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'guess', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'room', 'budget', 'hire', 'good', 'impersonator', 'also', 'agree', 'comment', 'being', 'entire', 'movie', 'being', 'shot', 'such', 'dark', 'setting', 'Where', 'trying', 'save', 'money', 'lighting', 'covering', 'up', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'weight', 'gain', 'use', 'lot', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'Then', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'distributor', 'DVD', 'had', 'talked', 'personally', 'Who', 'Sony', 'decided', 'even', 'accept', 'distribution', 'so-called', 'movie', 'Who', 'ever', 'was', 'should', 'be', 'fired', 'commented', 'received', 'countless', 'complaints', 'movie', 'already', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'was', 'way', 'part', 'Sony', 'involvement', 'movie', 'was', 'decision', 'producers', 'director', 'movie', 'release', 'poor', 'quality', 'badly', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'going', 'sell', 'had', 'picture', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'cover.I', 'got', 'impression', 'Sony', 'will', 'eventually', 'drop', 'distribution', 'title', 'hot', 'potato', 'so', 'check', 'out', '5.99', 'bins', 'Wal-mart', 'really', 'want', 'title', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'print', 'very', 'long', 'Personally', 'had', 'seen', 'spent', '20.00', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'bought', '5.99.It', 'wonder', 'new', 'releases', 'are', 'never', 'discounted', 'other', 'new', 'releases', 'hit', 'store', 'shelves', 'Tuesdays', 'market', 'more.To', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'GIVE', 'IT', 'UP', ""'re"", ""'has"", 'been', 'ca', ""n't"", 'realize', 'time', 'past', 'Oh', 'way', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'money', 'milked', 'off', 'people', 'bought', ""'dog"", 'get', 'haircut', 'rat', 'nest', 'hanging', 'down', 'back', 'neck', ""'really"", 'looks', 'stupid', 'get', 'chopped', 'off', 'save', 'up', 'money', 'larger', 'trench', 'coat', ""'ll"", 'be', 'needing', 'one', 'have', 'been', 'wearing', ""n't"", 'covering', 'up', 'anymore', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'been', 'playing', 'such', 'roles', 'so', 'long', 'actually', 'think', 'sort', 'indestructible', 'militaristic', 'C.I.A.', 'super', 'spook']",Attack Force

Basically, each of Seagal's films has its fans and haters, no matter how bad or good it is. However, if there is a film of which the quality almost all Seagal devotees agree on, it's ""Attack Force"" - a sloppy, long-winded mess that highlights just about all of our hero's faults and inefficiencies.Trying to explain the plot is a chore within itself, so here's the barest rendition: Seagal is the leader of a military strike team that gets wiped out in Paris by a prostitute juiced up on CTX - a drug that turns anybody into a vicious, remorseless killing machine. Upon finding out that CTX is funded by the military, Seagal must evade assassination from the inside whilst leading another team to stop the drug from being released into the city water supply.Like I mentioned before, the film encompasses everything that critics like to sneer at Seagal for: in addition to the plot that quickly descends into something totally incomprehensible (did anybody besides me realize that the ending offers absolutely no resolution?), the film's production is dark and dreary, the fight choreography is lacklustre, and Seagal is out-of-shape, uninspired in his acting, and has large portions of his voice dubbed by another actor. That last aspect is what really breaks the movie: in the past, small segments of the aikido master's dialogue have been voiced over in post-production, but in ""Attack Force"", roughly half of the film sees Seagal's lines being dubbed by someone who sounds only vaguely like him. This is done so obviously - even when Seagal is in clear sight and his lips do not match the words heard by audiences - that casual viewers will begin to wonder what the heck is going on. (supposedly this is because the film's storyline was altered during post-production after Seagal's scenes were shot; the original plot featured Seagal battling aliens)So, with a storyline that few will be able to follow and a star who is not speaking for himself, we fall back on a handful of braindead action scenes, a supporting cast that never believes in the script in the first place and whose biggest star is Dwayne Dixon fromReign of Fire, sets so consistently dark that viewers who keep watching will end up depressed, and Seagal feeding his ego by smooching Lisa ""Tia"" Lovnrand, who looks to be about thirty years younger than him. The issue of the fight scenes is particularly lamentable, since at one point we see Seagal donning wrist-mounted blades to fight his foes; capitalizing on something cool like this could have potentially saved the film from complete oblivion, but sadly, we're treated to short, quick-cut fights that are less frequent than the uninspired shootouts.Needless to say, this is probably the lowest that Seagal can afford to sink before even small-name studios stop putting him in their films. Watching a film like ""Attack Force"" can make you wonder if this is really the same man whose most successful film grossed over $156 million fifteen years ago and who has rubbed shoulders with the likes of Tommy Lee Jones and Kurt Russell. ""Attack Force"" is by no means a must-watch, even for Seagal fans, and it is sure to grace the collections of only the most die-hard of devotees.",1,Can't Force Me To Watch It Again,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,3493,"['Traditionally', 'reaction', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'DTV', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Movies', 'largely', 'deemed', 'good', 'likeUrban', 'Justice', 'have', 'obvious', 'detractors', 'even', 'ones', 'generally', 'considered', 'crap', 'have', 'fans', 'likeOut', 'Kill', 'venerated', 'inSeagalogy', 'Study', 'Ass-Kicking', 'Films', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Basically', 'Seagal', 'films', 'fans', 'haters', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'good', 'However', 'film', 'quality', 'almost', 'Seagal', 'devotees', 'agree', 'Attack', 'Force', 'sloppy', 'long-winded', 'mess', 'highlights', 'just', 'hero', 'faults', 'inefficiencies.Trying', 'explain', 'plot', 'chore', 'so', 'here', 'barest', 'rendition', 'Seagal', 'leader', 'military', 'strike', 'team', 'wiped', 'out', 'Paris', 'prostitute', 'juiced', 'up', 'CTX', 'drug', 'anybody', 'vicious', 'remorseless', 'killing', 'machine', 'finding', 'out', 'CTX', 'funded', 'military', 'Seagal', 'must', 'evade', 'assassination', 'inside', 'whilst', 'leading', 'team', 'stop', 'drug', 'being', 'released', 'city', 'water', 'supply.Like', 'mentioned', 'film', 'everything', 'critics', 'sneer', 'Seagal', 'addition', 'plot', 'quickly', 'something', 'totally', 'incomprehensible', 'did', 'anybody', 'realize', 'ending', 'offers', 'absolutely', 'resolution', 'film', 'production', 'dark', 'dreary', 'fight', 'choreography', 'lacklustre', 'Seagal', 'out-of-shape', 'uninspired', 'acting', 'large', 'portions', 'voice', 'dubbed', 'actor', 'last', 'aspect', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'past', 'small', 'segments', 'aikido', 'master', 'dialogue', 'have', 'been', 'voiced', 'post-production', 'Attack', 'Force', 'roughly', 'half', 'film', 'Seagal', 'lines', 'being', 'dubbed', 'someone', 'who', 'only', 'vaguely', 'done', 'so', 'obviously', 'even', 'when', 'Seagal', 'clear', 'sight', 'lips', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'words', 'heard', 'audiences', 'casual', 'viewers', 'will', 'begin', 'wonder', 'what', 'heck', 'going', 'supposedly', 'film', 'storyline', 'was', 'altered', 'post-production', 'Seagal', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'original', 'plot', 'featured', 'Seagal', 'battling', 'aliens', 'So', 'storyline', 'few', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'star', 'who', 'not', 'speaking', 'fall', 'back', 'handful', 'braindead', 'action', 'scenes', 'supporting', 'cast', 'never', 'script', 'first', 'place', 'biggest', 'star', 'Dwayne', 'Dixon', 'fromReign', 'Fire', 'so', 'consistently', 'viewers', 'who', 'keep', 'watching', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'depressed', 'Seagal', 'feeding', 'ego', 'smooching', 'Lisa', 'Tia', 'Lovnrand', 'who', 'be', 'thirty', 'years', 'younger', 'issue', 'fight', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'lamentable', 'one', 'point', 'see', 'Seagal', 'donning', 'wrist-mounted', 'blades', 'fight', 'foes', 'capitalizing', 'something', 'cool', 'could', 'have', 'potentially', 'saved', 'film', 'complete', 'oblivion', 'sadly', ""'re"", 'treated', 'short', 'quick-cut', 'fights', 'are', 'less', 'frequent', 'uninspired', 'shootouts.Needless', 'say', 'probably', 'lowest', 'Seagal', 'can', 'afford', 'sink', 'even', 'small-name', 'studios', 'stop', 'putting', 'films', 'Watching', 'film', 'Attack', 'Force', 'can', 'make', 'wonder', 'really', 'same', 'man', 'most', 'successful', 'film', 'grossed', '156', 'million', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'who', 'rubbed', 'shoulders', 'likes', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Attack', 'Force', 'means', 'must-watch', 'even', 'Seagal', 'fans', 'sure', 'grace', 'collections', 'only', 'most', 'die-hard', 'devotees']",Attack Force

However, the movie was so bad that I couldn't even sleep to it - LOL!! There is extensive dubbing of Seagal's voice, and the ""actor"" they got to dub Seagal's voice isn't even close. Not to mention that I'm not talking about his voice being dubbed when he's not facing the camera or something somewhat undetectable. There are 5-minute long conversations with the camera facing him where the entire conversation is dubbed. It's like watching some dubbed Asian flick from the 70's and not in a good way!! I'd say about 40% of his lines were dubbed in this way - really bad!!The story seems interesting on the outset - a drug called CTX has the capacity to give people super-human strength, so the military is interested in it for their own purposes, there is a ""drug-cartel"" that is also interested in apparently trafficking the drug, there is a rogue military group interested in the drug, and the French police are investigating deaths as a result of the drug. However, the story doesn't really go anywhere from here and the scenes where people are fighting it out are so confusing you are not sure which group is killing which group, you just see that a bunch of people are dying.The drug has a sort of side effect I guess which makes peoples eyes turn into something that looks like it was stolen from Men in Black. You know, where Will Smith's character chases that guy down on foot at the opening of the movie - remember that? And his eyes are like the gills on a fish, blinking. That was okay though. What was really funny is that the drug also makes people have a metal knife that protrudes from their hand, which they use to slice open their victims. How exactly does that happen?! How does a drug make you grow a metal knife shaped object coming out of your hand? LOL, stupid!!The ending was really bad - of course there is a big fight and everyone dies but Seagal and his little Japanese sidekick, but so what! Does that mean the military has given up on trying to kill Seagal? Earlier in the movie he killed a similar kind of military death squad and they just sent another death squad after him. So now that he killed this second squad, they are just going to give up?! The whole part about Seagal's character being part of the ""good military"" and the ""bad military"" was trying to kill him, was a little ridiculous and hard to follow.You don't see Seagal using any of his Aikido really, it's just fake digitally-enhanced fighting scenes, though there were a couple of decent military-style shoot-outs. But overall this was one of the worst Seagal flicks I've ever seen, though still better than ""Kill Switch"" or ""Against the Dark.""

It kind of felt like an old school Saturday when we used to spend our evening watching some hilarious flicks, except 2 key members were missing. None the less it brought Sid's mind back to the good old days which is always a welcomed occasion.In Attack force Seagal plays Marshall Lawson and has unleashed his finest mullet to date. This thing is good, we want to be friends with it. It pretty much looks like his ponytail also gained weight forcing to stretch wide for a full mullet/Myers effect that cannot be contained.

1022126,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000ION79Y,trebe,"[0, 0]","With a plot that is often difficult to make heads or tails of, Attack Force (2006) is one wacky and confusing adventure flick.  At times what happens is so ridiculously obtuse, that it is unintentionally humorous.  Action star Steven Seagal, does very little fighting until the very end.  Throughout the film, Seagal's voice annoyingly alternates between his own, and being dubbed by someone who sounds much older (reportedly Martin Sheen) and lacks Seagal's trademark drawl.Marshall Lawson (Seagal), some kind of operative for the US government, is in Paris with his associate Dwayne (Davis Kennedy), preparing for some kind of mission.  Three new members of Lawson's unit visit a bar, and bring back a girl named Reina (Evelyne Armela O'Bami) to their hotel room.  Unfortunately instead of a night of fun, the men are murdered, and are apparently injected with CTX, an experimental drug that can make people hyper-violent.Lawson's close friend Tia (Lisa Lovbrand) is a biochemist who happens to have worked on the development of CTX, together with a man named Aroon (Adam Croasdell), who has since ""defected"".  Aroon is the owner of the bar the soldiers visited, and has been testing CTX on his customers and employees, including Reina.Aroon is working with a woman (credited as ""the Queen"" and played by Ileana Lazariuc) and has plans to release CTX into the city's water supply.  Lawson is working to prevent this, as well as track down the killer of his men.  Also in the picture are American naval intelligence, and the French police.The pieces don't fit together very well, but it all builds up to a massive assault led by Lawson, who leads a convoy of military vehicles to a small village where Aroon is headquartered.  The action sequences, involving soldiers gunning down CTX infected civilians, are pretty appalling.  Lawson himself kills a couple who are dining, with rapid fire shots to the head.The team proceeds to a church, where Aroon is processing the CTX.  One of the gimmicks featured in the film are blades attached to the wrists.  Using these weapons, Lawson battles Aroon and the Queen, who are both amped up on CTX.  Most of his fight with the Queen is shown in slow motion, with Seagal often waving his hands around ridiculously.  Lawson wounds the Queen in the chest, slashing her bra in half, but she manages to continue fighting without exposing her ample bloodstained breasts.  Seagal's fighting scenes come mostly at the very end, and are certainly far from his best work, although the nanographite wrist blades do deliver some nasty wounds.  Building quality in France must not be very good, as people keep crashing through walls.A very ragged affair that fragments apart at the end, Attack Force is a blend of short action sequences, and a series of obscure meetings with pretentious dialog, that culminates with an insane military operation.  As the film concludes, Aroon has succeeded in contaminating the water supply with CTX, and Lawson's attack force is sadly reduced to just two men.  Sony Pictures apparently was unsure about the direction that Attack Force would ultimately take, and their decision is quite bad, as dozens of US troops lie dead on foreign soil, and some French citizens will soon be experiencing the wonders of CTX.  Though this disaster rates only 1.5 stars, and Seagal's performance is far from stellar, it may not be fair to blame him for matters that were out of his control.",2,"a confusing mess, that is probably one of Seagal's worst ever...",1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,3437,"['plot', 'often', 'difficult', 'make', 'heads', 'tails', 'Attack', 'Force', '2006', 'one', 'wacky', 'confusing', 'adventure', 'flick', 'times', 'what', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'unintentionally', 'humorous', 'Action', 'star', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'very', 'little', 'fighting', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'Seagal', 'voice', 'annoyingly', 'own', 'being', 'dubbed', 'someone', 'who', 'much', 'older', 'reportedly', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Seagal', 'trademark', 'drawl.Marshall', 'Lawson', 'Seagal', 'kind', 'operative', 'US', 'government', 'Paris', 'associate', 'Dwayne', 'Davis', 'Kennedy', 'preparing', 'kind', 'mission', 'Three', 'new', 'members', 'Lawson', 'unit', 'bar', 'bring', 'back', 'girl', 'named', 'Reina', 'Evelyne', 'Armela', ""O'Bami"", 'hotel', 'room', 'Unfortunately', 'instead', 'night', 'fun', 'men', 'are', 'murdered', 'are', 'apparently', 'injected', 'CTX', 'experimental', 'drug', 'can', 'make', 'people', 'hyper-violent.Lawson', 'close', 'friend', 'Tia', 'Lisa', 'Lovbrand', 'biochemist', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'development', 'CTX', 'together', 'man', 'named', 'Aroon', 'Adam', 'Croasdell', 'who', 'defected', 'Aroon', 'owner', 'bar', 'soldiers', 'visited', 'been', 'testing', 'CTX', 'customers', 'employees', 'including', 'Reina.Aroon', 'working', 'woman', 'credited', 'Queen', 'played', 'Ileana', 'Lazariuc', 'plans', 'release', 'CTX', 'city', 'water', 'supply', 'Lawson', 'working', 'prevent', 'as', 'well', 'track', 'killer', 'men', 'Also', 'picture', 'are', 'American', 'naval', 'intelligence', 'French', 'police.The', 'pieces', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'together', 'very', 'well', 'up', 'massive', 'assault', 'led', 'Lawson', 'who', 'convoy', 'military', 'vehicles', 'small', 'village', 'where', 'Aroon', 'headquartered', 'action', 'sequences', 'involving', 'soldiers', 'gunning', 'down', 'CTX', 'infected', 'civilians', 'are', 'pretty', 'appalling', 'Lawson', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'dining', 'rapid', 'fire', 'shots', 'head.The', 'team', 'proceeds', 'church', 'where', 'Aroon', 'processing', 'CTX', 'One', 'gimmicks', 'featured', 'film', 'are', 'blades', 'attached', 'wrists', 'Using', 'weapons', 'Lawson', 'Aroon', 'Queen', 'who', 'are', 'amped', 'up', 'CTX', 'Most', 'fight', 'Queen', 'shown', 'slow', 'motion', 'Seagal', 'often', 'waving', 'hands', 'ridiculously', 'Lawson', 'Queen', 'chest', 'slashing', 'bra', 'half', 'continue', 'fighting', 'exposing', 'ample', 'bloodstained', 'breasts', 'Seagal', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'come', 'mostly', 'very', 'end', 'are', 'certainly', 'far', 'best', 'work', 'nanographite', 'wrist', 'blades', 'do', 'deliver', 'nasty', 'wounds', 'Building', 'quality', 'France', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'people', 'keep', 'crashing', 'walls.A', 'very', 'ragged', 'affair', 'apart', 'end', 'Attack', 'Force', 'blend', 'short', 'action', 'sequences', 'series', 'obscure', 'meetings', 'pretentious', 'dialog', 'insane', 'military', 'operation', 'film', 'concludes', 'Aroon', 'succeeded', 'contaminating', 'water', 'supply', 'CTX', 'Lawson', 'attack', 'force', 'sadly', 'reduced', 'just', 'two', 'men', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'apparently', 'was', 'unsure', 'direction', 'Attack', 'Force', 'would', 'ultimately', 'take', 'decision', 'quite', 'bad', 'dozens', 'US', 'troops', 'lie', 'dead', 'foreign', 'soil', 'French', 'citizens', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'experiencing', 'wonders', 'CTX', 'disaster', 'rates', 'only', '1.5', 'stars', 'Seagal', 'performance', 'far', 'stellar', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fair', 'blame', 'matters', 'were', 'control']",Attack Force

1022128,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000ION79Y,Wayne C. Rogers,"[28, 29]","Like many of the other reviewers here, I've been a fan of Steven Seagal's since Above the Law came out in the late 80's.  I've enjoyed most of his American made films right up to Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds.  When Seagal severed his relationship with long-time production partner, Jules Nasso, and then Warner Brothers ended its relationship with our martial arts hero, the quality of Seagal's movies went downhill rather quickly as did his salary.  He dropped from making sixteen million a movie to a little over two million a picture.  In other words, to keep up his high standards of living, he now has to do four-to-five movies a year just to equal what he used to make on one Warner Brothers' picture.  Part of this is due to the increase in age (he's now 55) and weight (at least eighty-to-a-hundred pounds overweight for his height of 6' 4"") and his inability to do the fighting scenes that made him famous almost twenty years ago.  Add all of the above to bad directing, terrible scripts, and poor photography, and you have an actor who's barely hanging on to his career.  I have to also say that Seagal isn't the only actor who's had to resort to making films almost entirely in Europe.  Wesley Snipes has found himself in the same boat (though he could be avoiding the IRS) and so has Sylvester Stallone (Sly, however, is making a comeback with Rocky Balboa and a fourth ""Rambo"" film due out this summer).  And, like many of the other people who've reviewed Attack Force, I, too, keep hoping for a really good ""Seagal"" film that will display his talents as they used to be in his earlier movies.  Unfortunately, unlike the other reviewers, I didn't just buy Attack Force, I also purchased Today You Die at the same time.  I should've read the reviews first, but I didn't, and now I'm stuck with two clunkers.  Stupid me!!!Attack Force has Steven Seagal playing Marshall Lawson, the commander of a strike-force team, somewhat like Delta Force.  At the beginning of the movie, Lawson's team is almost completely wiped out at a night meeting.  Then, a little later, three of his remaining soldiers are murdered in their hotel room by a psycho bitch high on a new type of drug that has turned her into a killing machine with abnormal strength and reflexes, not to mention a strange pupil dilation that causes her eyes to look like those of a werewolf.  Now, as it turns out, this new drug is being developed by the United States to create a superior fighting soldier.  Because of Lawson's involvement due to the death of his men, certain members of the government decide to have him eliminated so that the cat isn't let out of the bag, but it's now too late.  More people have been infected with the drug than first realized and the government has to put them down before a mass epidemic of murder starts taking place in the French countryside.  Lawson is the only man who can do it, so he's chosen to lead a new strike force.  I think this kind of sums up the plot.  I'm not entirely sure because I was somewhat confused throughout the movie.  I didn't always know who the good guys were and who the bad guys were.  Example: Was the French detective a good or bad guy?  I don't know.  I suspect that this was a plot device designed to keep the viewer on his toes so that he wouldn't fall asleep due to movie-induced boredom.  .I'm now trying to think of something good to say about the movie, but nothing comes to mind except that the women in the film looked beautiful and deadly.  Steven Seagal likes to surround himself with beautiful women in his movies, and I don't blame him.  After all, he was one of the producers on this film.  I wonder if he pulled another ""Jenny McCarthy"" with them and made each potential female star take off her blouse so that he could check out her talent as an actress.  Oh, here's the big standout about the movie.  Mr. Seagal's voice was dubbed over dozens of times during the film.  Like one of the other critics, I originally thought something was wrong with my DVD and checked the ""Language"" section on the menu.  Nothing wrong there.  The only thing I can think of is that after the movie was completed, the director discovered that Seagal's voice didn't come through in every scene and so it had to be dubbed in certain places.  Also, because the drug-induced villains moved so fast and looked so strange, I thought at first that maybe Attack Force was a horror movie.  I mean a French undercover cop would be faced with a killer-crazed woman with weird eyes.  He'd turn around to run away and then she'd be standing in that direction, waiting for him.  I don't know of any drug that can make a person move with the speed of light.  Not only could these people move fast, but they also had super human strength.  They could knock a person through three walls instead of just one.  That's one hard punch.  Even Bruce Lee couldn't do that!  I guess the victims had super human strength, too, because they'd get right back up and try to defend themselves against these killing machines.  If I got knocked through three walls, I'd still be lying there unconscious, or else I'd play like I was unconscious so I wouldn't get killed.  The movie was filmed almost entirely at night, which made the action extremely hard to follow.  Maybe that was for the best.  Steven Seagal does very little fighting in the movie till the very end and then it's against a beautiful babe in leather shorts.  I wish I could make a living doing that!  By the way, at the end when the new strike force goes after these voracious killers, each member is picked off one by one just like in the usual ""teen-murder"" flicks.  Rather than sticking close together, the strike force makes the mistake of letting each other out of sight for a few moments, thereby enabling the enemy to kill them.  The only one who acts with any common sense is Seagal's sidekick, Na-boo, who stays glued to him like a new wife, while keeping a sharp eye out for anyone trying to sneak up behind them.  That was kind of funny to watch.  I guess this is the best that we can now expect from Steven Seagal.  He'll be sixty in a few years and doing wine commercials like the late Orson Wells.  I certainly don't anticipate his future movies getting any better.  I feel like everyone else in that I should've rented this film, instead of buying the damn thing.  Of course, I bought two clunkers, instead of one, so I've really learned my lesson this time around.  I'm now marking Steven Seagal (7th Degree Black Belt in Aikido, guitar player, director, producer, writer, former Tibetan monk in a previous lifetime, former husband of Kelly Le Brock, former C.I.A. operative, and who knows what else) off of my to-buy list.
