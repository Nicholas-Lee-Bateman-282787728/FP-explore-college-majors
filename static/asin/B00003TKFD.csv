Again, the familiar thread of conspiracies, forces at work that want to change and control the world fighting the forces that want to help and save humanity. Sound familiar? Well, it's a thread that runs through the history of storytelling from the Greeks in their plays, Hans Christen Anderson in his fairy tales and George Lucas' stories in Starwars. This series is a bit long and involved. Take it in small doses, a chunk at a time over several nights or an entire weekend when you have the time. After watching this movie, reaffirm the light in the world by going out to the beach and enjoying yourself or something equally life-force invigorating like a family get together.",5,Dark View of Cyberspace,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,750,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'dark', 'take', 'cyberspace', 'computers', 'tech', 'future', 'Again', 'familiar', 'thread', 'conspiracies', 'forces', 'work', 'want', 'change', 'control', 'world', 'fighting', 'forces', 'want', 'help', 'save', 'humanity', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Well', 'thread', 'history', 'storytelling', 'Greeks', 'plays', 'Hans', 'Christen', 'Anderson', 'fairy', 'tales', 'George', 'Lucas', 'stories', 'Starwars', 'series', 'bit', 'long', 'involved', 'Take', 'small', 'doses', 'chunk', 'time', 'several', 'nights', 'entire', 'weekend', 'when', 'have', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'reaffirm', 'light', 'world', 'going', 'beach', 'enjoying', 'something', 'equally', 'life-force', 'invigorating', 'family', 'get', 'together']",Wild Palms VHS
546699,A3DF6EAZ020LUI,B00003TKFD,"E. Oxenberg ""Just another stay-at-home comput...","[4, 5]","Here's a show exec-produced by Oliver Stone, one of the great conspiracy theorists of our times, and in the vein of Philip K. Dick as washed through the sensibilities of David Lynch. While ostensibly about mind control, political extremism, shadow cults and rich people wearing ties outside of their collars (apparently the new fashion in this ""alternate reality"" of the 90s), It's really a film noir exercise in merging American culture, especially Los Angeles culture, with Japanese tech sensibilities. Sometimes it works, sometimes it's a muddle.Jim Belushi notably remarked that after reading the script several times that he had absolutely no idea what the film was about and he just showed up every day and read his lines. After watching myself, I can understand...it's a very confusing story, assisted by the fact that for at least half of every episode some or all of the characters are tripping on the mind-control techniques that are the heart of the show. Who knows whether an important plot point is real or invented by the villains? We certainly don't.The good news is that if you like near-future paranoid conspiracies with likeable actors, Wild Palms is kinda fun to watch. Jim Belushi is pretty good as a lawyer thrust into a shadowy world he has no idea how to navigate, Robert Loggia chews up his scenes like nobody's business, and Angie Dickenson is the supreme corporate bitch-queen. Largely wasted are Dana Delaney, an '80s icon who never exceeded the heights she reached in ""China Beach,"" and Ernie Hudson, who put his wry, world-weary act to better use in ""The Crow."" Brad Dourif was firmly in the grip of his brilliant-but-mentally-crippled phase after making his name in ""One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest"" and losing it again with ""The Wall."" Sure some of the dialog and plotlines are clunky, but at least they move the story forward. For those of us raised on sci-fi, the idea of projected holograms and drug-induced virtual reality a l&aacute; Star Trek TNG's Holodeck was pretty enticing, though, and the hidden agenda infighting was fun to chew on.The bad news is that this DVD set is dreary. The transfer is muddy and dark, colors never pop, everything's too red and there's no shadow detail whatsoever, and besides it's 4:3 not widescreen. Honestly, I'd believe the studio dubbed this off a VHS tape if I didn't know better. There are no extras to speak of; the most you can say for the video is that there aren't any commercials to interrupt the show.Interesting side note: Kathryn Bigelow, whose next film was the equally paranoid ""Strange Days"" (which was produced by Alien-lover Jim Cameron and had similar themes of drug-induced VR) directed the last episode of the series.",3,Interesting if confusing '90s miniseries worth a look,1192147200,"10 12, 2007",2007,2708,"['Here', 'show', 'exec-produced', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'one', 'great', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'times', 'vein', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'washed', 'sensibilities', 'David', 'Lynch', 'ostensibly', 'mind', 'control', 'political', 'extremism', 'shadow', 'cults', 'rich', 'people', 'wearing', 'ties', 'collars', 'apparently', 'new', 'fashion', 'alternate', 'reality', '90s', 'really', 'film', 'noir', 'exercise', 'merging', 'American', 'culture', 'especially', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'culture', 'Japanese', 'tech', 'sensibilities', 'muddle.Jim', 'Belushi', 'notably', 'remarked', 'reading', 'script', 'several', 'times', 'had', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'about', 'just', 'showed', 'up', 'day', 'read', 'lines', 'watching', 'can', 'understand', 'very', 'confusing', 'story', 'assisted', 'fact', 'least', 'half', 'episode', 'characters', 'are', 'tripping', 'mind-control', 'techniques', 'are', 'heart', 'show', 'Who', 'important', 'plot', 'point', 'real', 'invented', 'villains', 'certainly', ""don't.The"", 'good', 'news', 'like', 'near-future', 'paranoid', 'conspiracies', 'likeable', 'actors', 'Wild', 'Palms', 'kinda', 'fun', 'watch', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'pretty', 'good', 'lawyer', 'thrust', 'shadowy', 'world', 'idea', 'how', 'navigate', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'up', 'scenes', 'nobody', 'business', 'Angie', 'Dickenson', 'supreme', 'corporate', 'bitch-queen', 'Largely', 'wasted', 'are', 'Dana', 'Delaney', ""'80s"", 'icon', 'who', 'never', 'exceeded', 'heights', 'reached', 'China', 'Beach', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'who', 'put', 'wry', 'world-weary', 'act', 'better', 'use', 'Crow', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'was', 'firmly', 'grip', 'brilliant-but-mentally-crippled', 'phase', 'making', 'name', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cookoo', 'Nest', 'losing', 'again', 'Wall', 'Sure', 'dialog', 'plotlines', 'are', 'clunky', 'least', 'move', 'story', 'forward', 'raised', 'sci-fi', 'idea', 'projected', 'holograms', 'drug-induced', 'virtual', 'reality', 'l', 'aacute', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TNG', 'Holodeck', 'was', 'pretty', 'enticing', 'though', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'infighting', 'was', 'fun', 'chew', 'on.The', 'bad', 'news', 'DVD', 'set', 'dreary', 'transfer', 'muddy', 'dark', 'colors', 'never', 'pop', 'everything', 'too', 'red', 'shadow', 'detail', 'whatsoever', '4:3', 'not', 'widescreen', 'Honestly', ""'d"", 'believe', 'studio', 'dubbed', 'off', 'VHS', 'tape', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'are', 'extras', 'speak', 'most', 'can', 'say', 'video', 'are', ""n't"", 'commercials', 'interrupt', 'show.Interesting', 'side', 'note', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'next', 'film', 'was', 'equally', 'paranoid', 'Strange', 'Days', 'was', 'produced', 'Alien-lover', 'Jim', 'Cameron', 'had', 'similar', 'themes', 'drug-induced', 'VR', 'directed', 'last', 'episode', 'series']",Wild Palms VHS
546700,AU03GLDS5TM0M,B00003TKFD,Foot Artist,"[79, 85]","The Wild Palms Mini Series first aired a few years ago, it was made for TV and it is based on the comic strip by the same name that appeared in Details Magazine in the early 90's. Its main audience was Generation X'ers,  but I've heard that the comic strip became very popular with  aging  hippies, potheads, and the &quot;underground&quot; in general because of  its offbeat pace and cerebral content.  I taped it off the TV when it first  aired and have watched it many, many times. I will definitely buy it on DVD  when it comes out. The film stars Jim Belushi as Harry Wyckoff; Dana  Delaney as Grace, his wife; Angie Dickinson as Josie, Grace's mother;  Robert Loggia as Senator Tony Kreutzer, Josie's brother; and a few others  like Kim Catrall,  Bebe Newirth , and Ernie Hudson.Wild Palms is a story  that takes place in the year 2065, and shows how technology has advanced to  the point of being at the verge of making hollographic images physically  interactive with human beings. Senator Kreutzer is about to launch a new  sitcom on Channel 3 called Church Windows which will project the characters  into people's living rooms. It will make people &quot;feel&quot; like part  of the TV program. The dark side of the plan is that in order for people to  interact with the hollograms, they have to take the drug MIMIZINE.  Prolonged use of the drug has a side effect...it causes the user to see  hallucinations of cathedrals and churches and it is ultimately fatal. But  Senator Kreutzer wants the whole world to get hooked on hollographic TV for  his own purposes, but you'll have to watch the film to find out what that  is.Wild Palms is the first major production concerning VIRTUAL REALITY,  though there was a kind of predecessor in TRON and in other lesser known  films. The concept of VR has been used in movies again and again since Wild  Palms in varying degrees of benevolence and malevolence (e.i. THE LAWNMOWER  MAN, VIRTUOSITY, THE MATRIX), but when Wild Palms first came out the idea  of VR was pretty fresh and open to exploration. The premise of VR is that  human beings can communicate, interact, copulate, and in essence live and  die in VR which is an extension of the real world within a network of  computers (like the internet).The conflict in Wild Palms begins with  Senator Kreutzer, he is the founder of a group called &quot;The  Fathers&quot; who epitomize capitalism and right-wing, traditional politics  (their corruption notwithstanding). Their antagonists are &quot;The  Friends&quot; whose founder is a political prisoner named Eli Levitz. Eli  used to be married to Josie...their daughter is Grace.Chickie Levitz  (played by Brad Douriff) has the secret to the GO CHIP, which is the thing  that will allow Senator Kreutzer to achieve his final goal once everyone is  hooked into the Church Windows Sitcom.Throughout the film there's  betrayal, seduction, incest, murder, and torture. None of it is overly  graphic as it is not a &quot;gore&quot; film as such. The atmosphere of  fear and impending doom is created more by what it implies than by what it  shows. Like when Josie pokes the eyes out the artist. Not much is shown in  the way of gore, but the scene is pretty disturbing.... Later in the film, as  he prepares for revenge ,he says to Josie, &quot;...once I was a painter, and  mixing colors was my joy...&quot;, he then pokes her eyes out, and as she's  screaming on the floor he shoots her a number of times.The film is very  textural and warbles in and out of psychological focus. It mixes Oriental  mysticism, politics, philosophy, hi-tech drugs, and the American Dream in a  mish-mash so weird, you just have to watch it to understand it. Many of the  scenes are reminiscent of Peter Greenaway films (a.i. A Zed and Two  Noughts, Drowning by Numbers, etc.)",5,MIND ALTERING TV &#65533; NOT FOR TECHNOPHOBES!,957312000,"05 3, 2000",2000,3812,"['Wild', 'Palms', 'Mini', 'Series', 'first', 'aired', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'based', 'comic', 'strip', 'same', 'name', 'appeared', 'Details', 'Magazine', 'early', '90', 'main', 'audience', 'was', 'Generation', ""X'ers"", ""'ve"", 'heard', 'comic', 'strip', 'became', 'very', 'popular', 'aging', 'hippies', 'potheads', 'quot', 'underground', 'quot', 'general', 'offbeat', 'pace', 'cerebral', 'content', 'taped', 'off', 'TV', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'will', 'definitely', 'buy', 'DVD', 'when', 'out', 'film', 'stars', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'Harry', 'Wyckoff', 'Dana', 'Delaney', 'Grace', 'wife', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'Josie', 'Grace', 'mother', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'Senator', 'Tony', 'Kreutzer', 'Josie', 'brother', 'few', 'others', 'Kim', 'Catrall', 'Bebe', 'Newirth', 'Ernie', 'Hudson.Wild', 'Palms', 'story', 'place', 'year', '2065', 'how', 'technology', 'advanced', 'point', 'being', 'verge', 'making', 'hollographic', 'images', 'physically', 'interactive', 'human', 'beings', 'Senator', 'Kreutzer', 'launch', 'new', 'sitcom', 'Channel', '3', 'called', 'Church', 'Windows', 'will', 'project', 'characters', 'people', 'living', 'rooms', 'will', 'make', 'people', 'quot', 'feel', 'quot', 'part', 'TV', 'program', 'dark', 'side', 'plan', 'order', 'people', 'interact', 'hollograms', 'have', 'take', 'drug', 'MIMIZINE', 'Prolonged', 'use', 'drug', 'side', 'effect', 'user', 'see', 'hallucinations', 'cathedrals', 'churches', 'ultimately', 'fatal', 'Senator', 'Kreutzer', 'whole', 'world', 'get', 'hooked', 'hollographic', 'TV', 'own', 'purposes', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'is.Wild', 'Palms', 'first', 'major', 'production', 'concerning', 'VIRTUAL', 'REALITY', 'was', 'kind', 'predecessor', 'TRON', 'other', 'lesser', 'known', 'films', 'concept', 'VR', 'been', 'used', 'movies', 'again', 'again', 'Wild', 'Palms', 'varying', 'degrees', 'benevolence', 'malevolence', 'e.i', 'LAWNMOWER', 'MAN', 'VIRTUOSITY', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'when', 'Wild', 'Palms', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'idea', 'VR', 'was', 'pretty', 'fresh', 'open', 'exploration', 'premise', 'VR', 'human', 'beings', 'can', 'communicate', 'interact', 'copulate', 'essence', 'live', 'die', 'VR', 'extension', 'real', 'world', 'network', 'computers', 'internet', 'conflict', 'Wild', 'Palms', 'Senator', 'Kreutzer', 'founder', 'group', 'called', 'quot', 'Fathers', 'quot', 'who', 'epitomize', 'capitalism', 'right-wing', 'traditional', 'politics', 'corruption', 'notwithstanding', 'antagonists', 'are', 'quot', 'Friends', 'quot', 'founder', 'political', 'prisoner', 'named', 'Eli', 'Levitz', 'Eli', 'used', 'be', 'married', 'Josie', 'daughter', 'Grace.Chickie', 'Levitz', 'played', 'Brad', 'Douriff', 'secret', 'GO', 'CHIP', 'thing', 'will', 'allow', 'Senator', 'Kreutzer', 'achieve', 'final', 'goal', 'everyone', 'hooked', 'Church', 'Windows', 'Sitcom.Throughout', 'film', 'betrayal', 'seduction', 'incest', 'murder', 'torture', 'None', 'overly', 'graphic', 'not', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'such', 'atmosphere', 'fear', 'impending', 'doom', 'created', 'more', 'what', 'what', 'when', 'Josie', 'eyes', 'out', 'artist', 'Not', 'much', 'shown', 'way', 'gore', 'scene', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'Later', 'film', 'revenge', 'Josie', 'quot', 'once', 'was', 'painter', 'mixing', 'colors', 'was', 'joy', 'quot', 'then', 'eyes', 'out', 'screaming', 'floor', 'number', 'times.The', 'film', 'very', 'textural', 'warbles', 'psychological', 'focus', 'mixes', 'Oriental', 'mysticism', 'politics', 'philosophy', 'hi-tech', 'drugs', 'American', 'Dream', 'mish-mash', 'so', 'weird', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'understand', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'films', 'a.i', 'Zed', 'Two', 'Noughts', 'Drowning', 'Numbers', 'etc']",Wild Palms VHS

I'm not sure what the master was on this, but there's a lot of color bleeding, and a lot of blur -- more than the intentional soft focus that many scenes were shot it.The picture itself is 4:3, which isn't completely unexpected, given that this was a miniseries... but it's disappointing nonetheless. And unfortunately, the audio was a bit neglected, as well.For the price, I can't really complain. But since I own the VHS set and the Australian import DVD set, there wasn't very much to gain here.Since so many people draw parallels with Twin Peaks, I can say that the picture and sound quality of the Twin Peaks DVD's are incredible by comparison.

This series is almost a made for TV version of The Matrix, and while it is a bit dated in some ways, it is still very cutting edge in others. As a neo-noir storyline, it incorporates influences as far reaching as technology, corruption, and scientology. Granted, the quasi-religious movement in the series is called syntheotics, but there are many parallels to scientology.I found the series to be well-written, the performances honest and convincing, and the dialogue very natural with the exception of a few puns. I'm sure not everyone will like the series, but I for one was thrilled to find it available on DVD. There will come a time when my tape wears out, or you can no longer find a functioning VCR.",5,Blast from the Past,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,1042,"['many', 'other', 'fans', 'taped', 'off', 'TV', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'watching', '10', 'years', 'later', 'absolutely', 'love', 'mini-series', 'years', 'have', 're-watched', 'numerous', 'times', 'still', 'love', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'comic', 'was', 'based', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'series', 'top-notch', 'series', 'almost', 'made', 'TV', 'version', 'Matrix', 'bit', 'dated', 'ways', 'still', 'very', 'cutting', 'edge', 'others', 'neo-noir', 'storyline', 'influences', 'far', 'reaching', 'technology', 'corruption', 'scientology', 'Granted', 'quasi-religious', 'movement', 'series', 'called', 'syntheotics', 'are', 'many', 'parallels', 'scientology.I', 'series', 'be', 'well-written', 'performances', 'honest', 'convincing', 'dialogue', 'very', 'natural', 'exception', 'few', 'puns', ""'m"", 'sure', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'series', 'one', 'was', 'thrilled', 'find', 'available', 'DVD', 'will', 'come', 'time', 'when', 'tape', 'out', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'find', 'functioning', 'VCR']",Wild Palms VHS

I believe my words were: ""Wow.  This is that?  ABC made this?  This is freaky.""  I bought a laser disc player and the 12"" LDs and played it back to back several times over the years, it is still great.Right up there with some of the higher - but not the highest - level Philip K Dick stuff.I can't wait for the dvd release.>>Update after release:  What a shame they made it from such a bad print.  Black hair becomes a black blob, shadows go from white to black.  Contrast adjustments don't help.  Yes, the VHS tapes were this way too but my LDs aren't so it is the fault of the production company.

Oliver stone, riding high from JFK fame, wrote the story to this one.  James Belushi plays the main character, which was a choice that still boggles my mind.  The series was plenty long, but not to drug out. It to me seemed choppy on exactly how many months/years the series took place over. And for some reason everybody let Belushi go instread of just killing him or locking him away. The ending did leave the series open to interpretation, I thought the friends had won, but it sounds like he was going to fight more of the fathers, and did the senator die, or is he in cyberspace and we not find out yet.  Stone did well with the small screen format. A good piece of TV history, and catchy to rewatch periodically and see if any other clues are noticed.
