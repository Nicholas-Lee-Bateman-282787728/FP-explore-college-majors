1054689,A12A7J2T5HCFGE,B000N8UXT2,a fan,"[1, 1]","""Martin's"" second act is no disappointment. After the brilliant first season, Martin and the gang return with more laughs and more memorable moments. The level of classics may not be as common as in the first season (still the best, in my opinion), but the moments are definitely there. This season, the characters are more developed, and the subtleties that made this show so great are really starting to gain momentum, including the through-thick-and-thin affection between Martin and Gina, Martin's endless catalogue of Pam jokes, Tommy ""not havin no job"" and Cole just being a bumbling idiot. Sure, these themes thrived towards the middle and end of the first season, but the formula has pretty much been perfected in Season 2. Some of the classic moments from this season: Martin's high school reunion, his duels with Tommy Hearns in the boxing ring and ""Michael Jackson"" in a Hollywood parking lot, Gina killing Mama Payne's beloved bird, and Martin, Tommy and Cole delivering a baby. This season also features appearances by many of the colorful characters that fans of the series can't live without, including Bro'Man, Jerome, and Officer Otis. The laughs are non-stop, and this DVD set will leave you wanting more. This and the first season set (along with the 3rd season DVD), are friendly reminders that before the controversies and backstage circumstances that lessened the quality of the show's later seasons, ""Martin"" was truly one of the funniest shows in TV history, African-American or otherwise.",5,No sign of sophomore jinx,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,1513,"['Martin', 'second', 'act', 'disappointment', 'brilliant', 'first', 'season', 'Martin', 'gang', 'return', 'more', 'laughs', 'more', 'memorable', 'moments', 'level', 'classics', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'common', 'first', 'season', 'still', 'best', 'opinion', 'moments', 'are', 'definitely', 'there', 'season', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'developed', 'subtleties', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'great', 'are', 'really', 'starting', 'gain', 'momentum', 'including', 'through-thick-and-thin', 'affection', 'Martin', 'Gina', 'Martin', 'endless', 'catalogue', 'Pam', 'jokes', 'Tommy', 'not', 'havin', 'job', 'Cole', 'just', 'being', 'bumbling', 'idiot', 'Sure', 'themes', 'thrived', 'middle', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'formula', 'pretty', 'much', 'been', 'perfected', 'Season', '2', 'classic', 'moments', 'season', 'Martin', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'duels', 'Tommy', 'Hearns', 'boxing', 'ring', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Hollywood', 'parking', 'lot', 'Gina', 'killing', 'Mama', 'Payne', 'beloved', 'bird', 'Martin', 'Tommy', 'Cole', 'delivering', 'baby', 'season', 'also', 'appearances', 'many', 'colorful', 'characters', 'fans', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'including', ""Bro'Man"", 'Jerome', 'Officer', 'Otis', 'laughs', 'are', 'non-stop', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'first', 'season', 'set', '3rd', 'season', 'DVD', 'are', 'friendly', 'reminders', 'controversies', 'backstage', 'circumstances', 'lessened', 'quality', 'show', 'later', 'seasons', 'Martin', 'was', 'truly', 'one', 'funniest', 'shows', 'TV', 'history', 'African-American', 'otherwise']",Martin: Season 2

Francois ""tfrancois""","[3, 4]","I think the Martin television series is one of the most important television shows in urban/African-American television history and it is proof that good comedy doesn't have to be vulgar, crude or disrespectful to its audience and yet still deliver the laughs as riotously and consistently as this show always does.  The writing was superb, the acting was terrific, and the ensemble cast worked so well together on-screen that it was hard to imagine that they weren't all really friends in real life.  The show never seems to seem ""stale"" or out-dated, even after the show has been off the air for many years.  I have watched shows countless times, and the laughs still come as strong as they were first-run episodes and that is a rarity that speaks well to why the show was so successful.  I'm a fan for life and I would not hesitate to allow my own children to watch the show, and that speaks VOLUMES.  Martin Lawrence, if he does nothing else (although we know he has and will), should be proud of this body of work and he should feel comfortable when he is mentioned with the likes of Flip Wilson, Redd Foxx, and early Richard Pryor (before big-budget movie fame) when it comes to being a part of black performers in ground-breaking television history.And specifically, let me speak to this 2-part episode in this landmark television show.  For a few seasons, we followed Martin and Gina in their VERY normal up and down, but always LOVING relationship and were content with the fact that they had not yet made it to the alter because you always had a sense that it was inevitable and would happen someday.  We understood they are made for each other and no matter what, they would make it final in due time.  But you never felt a sense of urgency or longed for immediate resolution to this question, and that is a credit to the way the writers, producers, and actors chose to deal with the issue and it always worked on-screen.  But as in normal relationships like these, you knew the time would come when rightfully so, Gina would want to be married and ready to start the next chapter and so this 2-parter dealt with this topic...finally.  And we relate to BOTH parties with their particular stance on the issue because it seemed REAL and not forced for the sake of pleasing a television audience.  But not to give anything away for those who have not seen the show (which I find VERY HARD TO BELIEVE), the way the show dealt with the inevitable was so satisfying and rewarding that even after I have seen this episode 15-20 times...it STILL holds up.  It doesn't come off to sappy or melodramatic, but simply real, poignant, relevant, and well...just right.  This gem is one of many in a proud show that I recommend to EVERYONE.  I'm a fan for life, Martin.  A fan for life.",5,We waited a long time and so did Gina...and it was worth it.,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,2782,"['think', 'Martin', 'television', 'series', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'television', 'shows', 'urban/African-American', 'television', 'history', 'proof', 'good', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'vulgar', 'crude', 'disrespectful', 'audience', 'yet', 'still', 'deliver', 'laughs', 'riotously', 'consistently', 'show', 'always', 'writing', 'was', 'superb', 'acting', 'was', 'terrific', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'on-screen', 'was', 'hard', 'imagine', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'friends', 'real', 'life', 'show', 'never', 'seem', 'stale', 'out-dated', 'even', 'show', 'been', 'off', 'air', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'watched', 'shows', 'countless', 'times', 'laughs', 'still', 'come', 'as', 'strong', 'were', 'first-run', 'episodes', 'rarity', 'well', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'successful', ""'m"", 'fan', 'life', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'allow', 'own', 'children', 'watch', 'show', 'VOLUMES', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'nothing', 'else', 'know', 'will', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'body', 'work', 'should', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'when', 'mentioned', 'likes', 'Flip', 'Wilson', 'Redd', 'Foxx', 'early', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'big-budget', 'movie', 'fame', 'when', 'being', 'part', 'black', 'performers', 'ground-breaking', 'television', 'history.And', 'specifically', 'let', 'speak', '2-part', 'episode', 'landmark', 'television', 'show', 'few', 'seasons', 'followed', 'Martin', 'Gina', 'VERY', 'normal', 'up', 'down', 'always', 'LOVING', 'relationship', 'were', 'content', 'fact', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'made', 'alter', 'always', 'had', 'sense', 'was', 'inevitable', 'would', 'happen', 'someday', 'understood', 'are', 'made', 'other', 'matter', 'what', 'would', 'make', 'final', 'due', 'time', 'never', 'felt', 'sense', 'urgency', 'longed', 'immediate', 'resolution', 'question', 'credit', 'way', 'writers', 'producers', 'actors', 'chose', 'deal', 'issue', 'always', 'worked', 'on-screen', 'normal', 'relationships', 'knew', 'time', 'would', 'come', 'when', 'rightfully', 'so', 'Gina', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'married', 'ready', 'start', 'next', 'chapter', 'so', '2-parter', 'dealt', 'topic', 'finally', 'relate', 'BOTH', 'parties', 'particular', 'stance', 'issue', 'seemed', 'REAL', 'not', 'forced', 'sake', 'pleasing', 'television', 'audience', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'show', 'find', 'VERY', 'HARD', 'TO', 'BELIEVE', 'way', 'show', 'inevitable', 'was', 'so', 'satisfying', 'rewarding', 'even', 'have', 'seen', 'episode', '15-20', 'times', 'STILL', 'up', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'sappy', 'melodramatic', 'simply', 'real', 'poignant', 'relevant', 'well', 'just', 'right', 'gem', 'one', 'many', 'proud', 'show', 'recommend', 'EVERYONE', ""'m"", 'fan', 'life', 'Martin', 'A', 'fan', 'life']",Martin: Season 2
