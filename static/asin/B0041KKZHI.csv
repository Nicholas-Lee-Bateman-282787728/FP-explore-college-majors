1381634,A1ECQED44Y4CMO,B0041KKZHI,Anchorage,"[0, 0]","Miniseries (Movie Review) HBO's Lavish production of Mildred Pierce pulls no punches, in fact its a lot like getting sucked punched in the gut! While I appreciated Kate Winslet's performance I feel staying too close to the book and staying too realistic may have hurt this miniseries instead of helping it. For instance in the original movie Mildred slaps Veda only once and you understand why she is such a doormat to her only surviving daughter. In this miniseries Mildred physically attacks Veda in parts 1, 2 and 5 and they come off more as combatants rather than mother and daughter. I also had a problem with how they portrayed Ida, Ida is supposed to be the one point of comic relief, always cracking a joke but always looking out for Mildred. This is also not your mother's Mildred Pierce as there is A LOT of nudity which given Ms. Crawford's track record she most likely would have had a problem with. I fell in love with the scenery however, did I mention this production was lavish, everything from the beach scenes to the long drives through California this miniseries jumps out at you in rich color. Now, I am not one of those people who can't appreciate a new version and it sometimes irks me to hear others not given remakes a chance. But in terms of rewatchability and having a sense of hope, instead of feeling awful afterwards, the classic Mildred Pierce is a winner for me.

1381650,AB34G6VKP28L,B0041KKZHI,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[23, 27]","Nominated for a slew of Emmys, HBO's Mildred Pierce is based on a novel that opens in the midst of the Great Depression, and centers around a housewife's attempts to keep her daughters fed and make a name for herself.Money is tight and Mildred (Kate Winslet) has been padding the grocery bill by making pies and cakes. But when she decides to kick her husband Bert (Br&iacute;an F. O'Byrne) out of the house for cheating on her and go at it alone, she rapidly discovers the world is not kind to a single mother. Determined not to rely on the charity of her friends, or accept help from her father-in-law, Mildred swallows her pride and becomes a waitress -- much to the horror of her eldest daughter, Veda (Morgan Turner), who puts on airs in spite of their impoverished situation. Soon, her talent in the kitchen will open up a new world of prospects, so long as she can keep the men in her life from becoming too much of a problem. Among them is the fashionable and charismatic Monty Beragon (Guy Pearce), but their tumultuous romance combined with Mildred's desperate attempts to live up to her daughter's impossible standards will take them all down a desperate path.Even though this miniseries boasts lovely period details and an impressive cast, I am not in love with it. This is due in part to the protagonists, few of whom I managed to like. Bert is the best thing this series has to offer and he's cheating on his wife! Mildred is a completely insecure woman who bends over backwards to try and ""earn"" the love of her utter wretch of a daughter, and only winds up being hurt... over and over again. At some point, the audience becomes frustrated with her and wishes she would move on. Monty is a total cad. On the up side, Mildred never lets her situation get so far out of hand that she cannot control it. She makes the best of multiple bad situations and in the end finds a bittersweet happiness (one the book did not offer). But the entire series lacks any redeeming value, so it becomes tedious entertainment, more inclined to painful turmoil than situations in which we find joy. When I put six hours into a film, I expect something in return and this one did not pay out.The cast is wonderful. Winslet makes a fine Mildred. The older version of Vera, by Evan Rachel Wood, is fantastic, complimenting the younger actress in such a believable manner that you can accept this is the same girl, all grown up. (She also at times eerily reminds me of Vivien Leigh.) But one has to wonder if Guy Pearce felt used, since much of the time all he is required to do is love scenes or stalk about the house, drink, and brood. I also had to question the need for full frontal nudity. The unlikable characters left me sorry that I bothered with this series at all. I'm grateful I had something else to do while it was playing in the background.

If you wanted to see a movie just like the original, then just see the original version. I'm glad this version is its own film. Kate Winslet's Mildred Pierce is different than Joan Crawford's, Winslet's is more tortured, emotionally unstable and her relationship with her daughter Veda is more complicated, she is ADDICTED to her daughter, like a drug, and no matter how much she suffers, she wants her in her life. Winslet's performance is fantastic, this woman is an actress in every sense of the word. All of the performances are great, except for Morgan Turner who plays the younger Veda. I'm sorry to say this, but almost every bit of dialogue she says feels awkward and forced. It's bad acting, miscasting or misdirection. Because of this the film does suffer. Anyway, my favorite thing about the movie is the details this long version is able to explore, like Mildred's job struggles, her relationship with her husband and Veda's opera singing(from the novel).The ending is also different and I liked the manipulative and cruel acts that you realize Veda is capable of in order for her to succeed.

She did a much better job in Revelitinary Road or maybe it was the supporting cast that made her look good in that film.So far this movie has been chopped up and trashed out.Watch ""Now Voyager"" with Betty Davis and or buy the origiunal version of this film and purchase the book.This whole film is not believeable, the actors just don't have a clue, it moves along slowly is pretty much redundant and reidiculous even for back in the day before I was born. If my Mother had to hide any job she did from me or my sisters we would have had our heads slapped off if we even once ridiculed her for anything she did for the family. The scene where Mildred comes home and throws up because she will have to work in a resturant  as a Server is ""Not believeable"", it was actually a give me a break and humorous moment.Who's writing this stuff? To make another long story short ""buy the original  Mildred Pierce and the Novel and with the money and time you have left over, buy ""Now Voyager"" with Betty Davis. That is a win, win situation.If you have seen the original  Mildred Pierce you will not like the mini-series, maybe it'll pick up the pace and something will happen? So far that's the only thing that keeps me watching this series has been Veda slapping Kate(Mildred) the girl playing Veda is very believeable and I love watching her dishing it out ""she has what it takes to play the part of Veda. Mildred(Kate)  need's something to wake her up  and maybe put out some realistic acting. So far getting slapped in the face isn't doing anything to wake that actress  up.  She is one boring actress., the maybe something will happen moment/anticipation is what thus far been making me continue to follow the story line.Also from what I can tell in this version is that Veda goes on to become oome a famious actress/singer is not going to work as well as Veda being as close as you could come then to today's version of  a stripper in the original. How could the writers and producers make that much of a huge change in a very dramadic important issue.

Any fine qualities that may exist are trumped by petty ones. There is no alliance that is not tainted by envy or resentment or disapproval.

1381663,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B0041KKZHI,Dr. James Gardner,"[15, 22]","""Mildred Pierce"" was a 1945 black and white film noir. It was based on the 1941 novel of the same name by James Cain (""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", ""Double Indemnity""), but the film was very different from the book. The film was nominated for 6 Oscars (Actress, Picture, Screenplay, Supporting Actress for Eve Arden and Ann Blyth, Cinematography) but only Crawford won. The 1945 version stands as one of the finest versions of film noir ever made.So why on earth would anyone want to film it again? The reason is that the original film was different from the book, so in some senses, the book itself never did reach the big screen. That being said, one can't help but compare the 1945 version with the 2011 version. There are problems doing this, since the 1945 version was done in the film noir style and the 2011 TV mini-series does not adopt thoseconventions.Acting (Mildred) - EvenThe Mildred Pierce character won awards for both actresses - Kate Winslet won an Emmy and Joan Crawford won an Oscar. Both performances are exceptional, and both are true to their genre. The Kate Winslet of 2011 would have looked silly in the 1945 film, as would Joan Crawford in their 2011 series. But each one in their own setting does an exceptional job.Acting (The Men) - Nod to 1945Zach Scott was excellent as the homme fatale, and Guy Pearce does a good job too. Again, Peace in the film noir version would have looked silly and Scott in the 2011 version would be equally out of place, but each in his own setting did a good job. It's the same thing with Bruce Bennett (Mildred's first husband) and Brian O'Byrne, both of whom do good jobs.The real difference in the men's category is Jack Carson (Mildred's husband's former partner). Carson was a scene stealer every time he appeared.Acting (The Women) - Nod to 1945Among the women in the 1945 version, what a cast! Ann Blyth as Veda (the daughter from hell) and Eve Arden as Ida (Mildred's restaurant friend) were both so good they earned Oscar nominations, the only one for both of them. This is not to disparage the performances of Mare Winningham (Ida) or Evan Rachel Wood (Veda), both of whom received Emmy nominations, but I think the women in the 1945 version were far better.Then there's Butterfly McQueen who was a treat, and her character really doesn't appear in the 2011 version. Of course, Melissa Leo is an equal treat, and her character doesn't appear in the 1945 version.So the acting credits are either even or favor the 1945 version. What about the technicals?Director - Nod to 1945* Michael Curtiz (1886-1962) is best known for his 7 films with Errol Flynn. He was nominated for an Oscar for their first collaboration (""Captain Blood"", 1935), and received 2 more nominations for films with Jimmy Cagney - ""Angels with Dirty Faces""(1938) and ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" (1941) - and one win for a film with Bogart (""Casablanca"", 1942).* Todd Haynes was nominated for an Emmy for this TV series for directing and writing, and for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for ""Far from Heaven"" (2002)Cinematography - Nod to 1945* 1945 - Ernest Haller provided beautiful black and white photography and received an Oscar nomination.  Haller filmed more than 100 movies and was nominated for an Oscar 7 times, and won once for ""GWTW"" (1939).* 2011 - Ed Lachman was nominated for an Emmy for this series and for an Oscar for ""Far from Heaven"" (2002)Music - Nod to 1945* 1945 - Between 1935 and 1956 Max Steiner  was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and ""The Informer"" (1935). He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.* Carter Burwell was nominated for an Emmy for his work in the TV series. He was nominated for a Golden Glove for ""Where the Wild things Are"" (2009) and a BAFTA for ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" (2000)Acknowledgement - Nod to 2011The 1945 version had 6 Oscar nominations and 1 win (Crawford). The 2011 version had 20 Emmy nominations and 2 wins (Winslet and Pearce). Bear in mind that there are dozens and dozens of ways to get an Emmy nomination, and far fewer ways to get an Oscar nomination, so the bulk of the nominations received for a TV show really can't be compared to a 1945 film.Comparison to Book - Nod to 2011The 1945 version was altered considerably, so it's clear that the 2011 version is truer to the book.Comparing the two versions, IMHO the nod goes to 1945. But the 2011 TV Mini Series can be appreciated as a very good piece of work in its own right, with a wonderful cast, good photography and music. Apart from the performances, I think the 2011 version does an excellent job in giving us the feel of the times. If there is one problem with the 2011 version it's that it is too long, and tries perhaps too much to capture the flavor of the book.Bottom line - if you're looking for a great film noir from the classic period, try the 1945 version. If you want a great adaptation of the James Cain book, try the 2011 version. But don't look for film noir in the 2011 version, and lovers of the book may find the 1945 version quite a bit different.",5,The 1945 film vs. the 2011 Mini series,1316649600,"09 22,

This is not meant to be a review of the entire miniseries, but instead a signal to those who may be avoiding this version, not caring to forget the 1945 version.Mildred Pierce (Kate Winslet) is suffering quietly in a marriage where the 'essentially unemployed' husband (Br&iacute;an F. O'Byrne) is having an affair to fill his idle hours and when Mildred discovers this she sends him packing: she has two daughters to raise in a 'proper way' and is encouraged by her friend and neighbor (Melissa Leo) to live her own life.  Mildred becomes employed as a waitress (much to the chagrin of her snotty daughter Veda - Morgan Turner) and eventually turns her waitressing into a business of her own (she has always sold her pies and cakes for income), taking up with her husband's 'friend' (James LeGros) who later helps her finance her ventures in the restaurant business.  As Mildred celebrates her success in readying her restaurant she meets a dashing rich lad from Pasadena (Guy Pearce) and after a spur of the moment one night trip to Santa Barbara she returns very happy only to find her younger daughter Ray is hospitalized...and the story will be continued.For those who may have doubts about extending the original 90 minute movie into a 5 hour miniseries, have no fear.  The expansion of the story is well conceived and executed - and the opportunity to see Kate Winslet own this role is well worth the time.

1381685,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B0041KKZHI,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[35, 41]","In Todd Haynes adaptation of ""Mildred Pierce,"" gone is the noir drama of the 1945 movie of the same name with Joan Crawford, and some screenwriting from William Faulkner, and it's replaced with a more faithful to the James M Cain novel, which is a much more realistic portrayal of the times, and captures the bright realism of the novel which is plays more like a Edward Hopper painting than noir.As in the novel, Mildred Pierce is a `grass widow,' which is depression era parlance for a divorced woman, needs to support her family of two children, Veda and Ray, because her husband Bert can't find a job and is carrying out an affair with a married woman. After Mildred throws Bert out she finds she only has skills enough for restaurant work and making pies. An employment agency sends her out on a job as a maid but pride won't allow her to take the job because she has to wear a uniform and defer to the lady of the house. Recuperating from the humiliation she felt at having to take a job as a maid in a diner she discovers they need a new waitress, and Mildred swallows her pride and takes the job. She quickly learns all the in's and out's of the restaurant business and opens her own, which in short order is successful. Her daughter Veda, who seems to have been born a snob, continually humiliates Mildred and those around her she considers of a lower social status (Why Veda feels that way we're never told, except from glimpses of Mildred behaving the same way such as kicking Bert only because she didn't get a winter fur coat) shows an interest in, and talent for playing the piano and as she grows older becomes an operatic singer. On the eve of opening her first restaurant Mildred meets, and has an affair with Monty Beragon, a faded aristocrat who's fortune's are in decline while Mildred's fortunes incline.""Mildred Pierce"" hangs squarely on Kate Winslet's shoulders as Mildred, not only does she turn in a strong performance she works in some nuances that inform the viewer of some of the texture of the novel.Guy Pearce as Monty Beragon has another role, while not totally disappearing into the character gives a performance of the character that starts as a carefree playboy, to a rangy dissipate, while his appearance mirrors that change.  His demeanor at first quite carefree but as time goes on, the elements that make Monty a charming aristocrat in decline darken and we see those same elements of him in a different light.Rachael Evan Walker doesn't show up as the older Veda until part 4 and while she shows some very affected mannerisms for the snobbish Veda. Towards the end looks very vampiric as Veda takes everything Mildred has. Unfortunately, other than two very tempestuous scenes, that she makes the most of, Wood is mostly shown singing at various operatic venues. As the younger Veda, Morgan Turner is the snobbish, haughty child who you would like to slap her face off for her affrontery.Mare Winningham as Ida is totally wasted in a part that could have been played by anyone. The two main male characters Bert (Brian F O'Byrne) and Wally Burgan (James LeGros) aren't given much to do except react to Mildred, especially Bert. But then they're weren't given a lot to do in the Cain novel either.Since it follows the novel so closely it has some of the failings of the novel. There isn't a lot of action or inner drama. Some of the dialogue feels clunky pulled right from the novel, whether it's because some of the vernacular has become anachronistic since Cain wrote the novel in 1941, or it was clumsily written by Cain. An example, Veda's dialogue some times doesn't sound like a real person would say it, but a character in a book would.HBO also has a half hour making of ""Mildred Pierce"" that I'm sure will make it to the DVD when they release it.",4,Faithful to the Novel,1302480000,"04 11, 2011",2011,3792,"['Todd', 'Haynes', 'adaptation', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'gone', 'noir', 'drama', '1945', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'screenwriting', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'replaced', 'more', 'faithful', 'James', 'M', 'Cain', 'novel', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'times', 'bright', 'realism', 'novel', 'more', 'Edward', 'Hopper', 'painting', 'noir.As', 'novel', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'grass', 'widow', 'depression', 'era', 'parlance', 'divorced', 'woman', 'support', 'family', 'two', 'children', 'Veda', 'Ray', 'husband', 'Bert', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'job', 'carrying', 'out', 'affair', 'married', 'woman', 'Mildred', 'Bert', 'only', 'skills', 'enough', 'restaurant', 'work', 'making', 'pies', 'employment', 'agency', 'out', 'job', 'maid', 'pride', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'take', 'job', 'wear', 'uniform', 'defer', 'lady', 'house', 'Recuperating', 'humiliation', 'felt', 'having', 'take', 'job', 'maid', 'diner', 'need', 'new', 'waitress', 'Mildred', 'pride', 'job', 'quickly', 'restaurant', 'business', 'own', 'short', 'order', 'successful', 'daughter', 'Veda', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'snob', 'continually', 'Mildred', 'considers', 'lower', 'social', 'status', 'Why', 'Veda', 'way', ""'re"", 'never', 'told', 'glimpses', 'Mildred', 'behaving', 'same', 'way', 'such', 'kicking', 'Bert', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'winter', 'fur', 'coat', 'interest', 'talent', 'playing', 'piano', 'older', 'becomes', 'operatic', 'singer', 'eve', 'opening', 'first', 'restaurant', 'Mildred', 'meets', 'affair', 'Monty', 'Beragon', 'faded', 'aristocrat', 'who', 'fortune', 'are', 'decline', 'Mildred', 'fortunes', 'incline', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'squarely', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'shoulders', 'Mildred', 'not', 'only', 'turn', 'strong', 'performance', 'nuances', 'inform', 'viewer', 'texture', 'novel.Guy', 'Pearce', 'Monty', 'Beragon', 'role', 'not', 'totally', 'disappearing', 'character', 'performance', 'character', 'carefree', 'playboy', 'rangy', 'dissipate', 'appearance', 'mirrors', 'change', 'demeanor', 'first', 'quite', 'carefree', 'time', 'elements', 'make', 'charming', 'aristocrat', 'decline', 'darken', 'see', 'same', 'elements', 'different', 'light.Rachael', 'Evan', 'Walker', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'older', 'Veda', 'part', '4', 'very', 'affected', 'mannerisms', 'snobbish', 'Veda', 'end', 'very', 'vampiric', 'Veda', 'everything', 'Mildred', 'Unfortunately', 'other', 'two', 'very', 'tempestuous', 'scenes', 'most', 'Wood', 'mostly', 'shown', 'singing', 'various', 'operatic', 'venues', 'younger', 'Veda', 'Morgan', 'Turner', 'snobbish', 'haughty', 'child', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'slap', 'face', 'affrontery.Mare', 'Winningham', 'Ida', 'totally', 'wasted', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'anyone', 'two', 'main', 'male', 'characters', 'Bert', 'Brian', 'F', ""O'Byrne"", 'Wally', 'Burgan', 'James', 'LeGros', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'do', 'react', 'Mildred', 'especially', 'Bert', 'then', ""'re"", 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'lot', 'do', 'Cain', 'novel', 'either.Since', 'novel', 'so', 'closely', 'failings', 'novel', ""n't"", 'lot', 'action', 'inner', 'drama', 'dialogue', 'feels', 'clunky', 'pulled', 'right', 'novel', 'vernacular', 'become', 'anachronistic', 'Cain', 'wrote', 'novel', '1941', 'was', 'clumsily', 'written', 'Cain', 'example', 'Veda', 'dialogue', 'times', ""n't"", 'sound', 'real', 'person', 'would', 'say', 'character', 'book', 'would.HBO', 'also', 'half', 'hour', 'making', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'make', 'DVD', 'when', 'release']",N/A

1381691,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B0041KKZHI,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[15, 26]","Before you see this remake - or arguably a modern update and perspective on an old movie - I beg you to see the originalMildred Pierce (Keepcase)with Joan Crawford playing Mildred Pierce and Ann Blyth as her daughter, a very spoiled young woman named Veda. Pay attention to the snappy dialogue, with lines that reverberate long after the movie's closing credits roll. Take note of the ending, the music, the pace. Now you are ready to watch the revamped version with Kate Winslet as Mildred and Evan Rachel Wood as Veda. Feel the difference?It also helps to read the very fine novel. I think it is essential to fully compare the movie and book versions of Mildred Pierce and think about which is truer to the author's writing.SPOILER alert: From this point on, there are some events revealed in this review. Many focus on contrasts between the old (1945) and new (2011) interpretation of Mildred Pierce - although I do leave out some crucial parts. To get an even a fuller perspective, consider reading Cain's bookMildred Pierce Publisher: Vintage.I do want to be clear that I had extremely high hopes for the HBO edition (shown in 5 parts)... but my hopes were ultimately dashed, especially in parts 4 and 5. The ending left me reeling as I thought ""What?! That is it?!"" To their credit, both Winslet and Wood (and the other actors) did all they could with their roles as written. But they couldn't transcend the script, the pace, the less than convincing events.For reasons that baffle me, the remake or ""update"" veers from the highly effective flashback and narration that ramped up the suspense, notch by notch, in the 1945 movie. The flashbacks were narrated by Crawford - and Crawford's Mildred Pierce was riveting (and still is) even though you already know a major part of what happened shortly after the film begins. Using police interrogations as a plot device was also a brilliant move. Some believe this is Crawford's best role. It is certainly among her finest.Yes, the older version is a period piece with some parts that would be considered politically incorrect today. Even so, the 1945 rendition is one that should still have appeal to contemporary viewers. Who doesn't want spoiled Veda, with all her affectations, to get hit hard by reality and ultimately face punishment?As played by Crawford and Winslet, both Mildred Pierces want only to protect Veda from the harsher realities of life and help her better herself. Nothing is too good for Veda even if that means working hard to make ends meet. I think the 1945 movie had a far more satisfying ending than the HBO episodes. I was absolutely baffled and disappointed by the way Winslet was left to deal with Veda at the end of the HBo series, although I do understand that the conclusion focuses more on Pierce's emotions and insights than in the earlier film.Unfortunately, this takes away from a satisfying ending. I felt as though I'd wasted my time watching that final episode.There is another reason that adds to the disappointment felt in watching the HBO version. Right after a major financial meltdown in the economy, what better time to create a remake of Mildred Pierce? The portrayal of a woman who struggles to make ends meet and decides to rise to the financial challenge could have been a way to inspire viewers. Mildred's weakness when it comes to her daughter could have stood out in glaring contrast to the rest of her life - Pierce's courage, guts, and tenacity. Instead, the HBO series somehow swerved into a pathetic portrayal of Mildred.Even worse, there wasn't an ending that gave viewers a sense of Mildred's future (although I know some are likely to argue that the ending shows that Pierce has finally ""seen the light""). But has she? Maybe after remarrying her ex-husband and temporarily heeding his advice to forget Veda, she'll try to win her daughter back - as she has time and again,even after vowing to rid herself of Veda.There are some pros to the  HBO incarnation of Mildred Pierce. The episodes certainly were filmed with many details, from costumes to cars, that lend authenticity to the film. The costumes, the historical recreation of time and place, etc...have the ring of truth. Winslet's wardrobe consists of some frumpy dresses that only make Veda seem more stylish.But the mini series simply can't hold a candle to the snap and substance of the original 1945 movie. Winslet comes across as far more than a mother with a weak spot for her spoiled daughter. She essentially lets herself be a complete doormat. But Crawford played a Mildred Pierce with some bite added to her need for Veda's approval. Evan Rachel Wood definitely brings to mind Ann Blyth in the role of Veda and her absolute self-absorption is believable. The younger version of Veda is less believable.And where are the kind of lines that compare to the older film? When Crawford drops her robe and appears in a stunning bathing suit, she takes a look at her male admirer and asks, ""What? No whistle?"" The guy replies, ""I'd need a police siren!"". That kind of give and take is lacking from the new version. The result is a tepid movie without emotional substance. Wish I could feel differently. What's your take?",3,Falls short of both the novel and Joan Crawford's 1945 portrayal of Pierce...the lowdown on the pros and cons,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,5190,"['see', 'remake', 'arguably',

1381693,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0041KKZHI,Kevin Killian,"[5, 9]","It didn't sound like a good idea when I read about this project in THR, for I was one who looked forward to Todd Haynes' Sirk pastiche Far From Heaven with great expectations shattered by the limp results.  And Mildred Pierce was to last for five hours!  It was my wife made me watch the show, but you know what, afterwards I was glad she did, for thinking it over, I find Mildred Pierce by far the best thing Haynes has done.  And yes, I am counting Safe and Poison and that Karen Carpenter show.The story is supposedly more faithful to the book than the old John Crawford vehicle, which is both good, and bad.  Cain's story, I think, was improved by the liberties Jerry Wald's screenwriters took with it, the framing device of the murder of Zachary Scott, which gave the tale an urgency and indeed a gravity that ultimately Haynes perhaps isn't very interested in--that's OK too.  Haynes is working in a cinema of gesture and hair color and costume and sound.  And of the ordinary lives of women I guess.  Though hiring Melissa Leo and Mare Winningham as hags doesn't exactly strike the ""ordinary"" note, but they're so bizarre Kate Winslet actually seems, in relief, like an everyday person, only fabulously beautiful even when she's vomiting in disgust for having to turn to waitressing to raise money after Bart leaves them.  We spent five hours wondering what was going to happen, and the answer is, about halfway through, cute little Morgan Turner, as the young Veda, goes away and comes back as Evan Rachel Wood and ruins the picture.  Well, that's too strong.  Evan Rachel Wood just isn't as nasty as the first little girl, that's all.  She's not a very good actress, and yet you can't take your eyes off of her, and if that's her voice they're using as Veda's singing voice then she's pretty astounding.I mean she was good in that Beatles film (at singing) but here she sounds like a young Kiri te Kanawa, except sexier.  Indeed the movie could have lost half an hour if they had limited her singing numbers to maybe one or two.  I didn't realize this was going to be a musical, and imagine what's on the cutting room floor.  The Deluxe version of the DVD is said to contain audio versions of omitted arias by Delibes and Gounod and others.  And she looks great with her clothes off, so does Kate, so does Guy Pearce.  Why Guy Pearce we wondered.  Was he the first name the producers thought of when they heard the show was MILDRED Pierce?  ""And we need a hot guy....""  Eureka!  It gets kind of funny when Kate Winslet and Guy Pearce are supposed to be this all-American California golden couple, but that's OK.  I don't want to spoil the plot for you, so I have no time to tell you what I think about chicken and waffles as a plot point, nor how odd it seems that no one knows Veda as a great singer until they hear her on the radio, but so be it.

1381694,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0041KKZHI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[114, 124]","When I heard that one of my favorite indie directors, Todd Haynes, was going to revisit the classic ""Mildred Pierce"" envisioned by hard boiled novelist James M. Cain--I was undeniably stoked and have patiently awaited the arrival of this new interpretation.  Of course, everyone knows that an original film version won Joan Crawford an Oscar (not to mention inspired my second favorite Carol Burnett show)--but that presentation was more forties melodrama than classic Cain.  Haynes has already proven a knack for period detail with the Douglas Sirk homage ""Far From Heaven"" (my favorite film of the year it was released), so I thought he might bring new life to this familiar tale.  And, indeed he has.  Eschewing some of the irony and romanticism that I had expected, Haynes has opted instead for a downbeat realism that highlights the Depression era class struggles in much more detail than the previous film version.I must admit that I literally sat there and watched the entire 5 hour HBO story from start to finish.  Of course, if you have a life--you probably aren't going to do the same and that's undoubtedly a good thing.  I think it is best to let this ""Mildred Pierce"" unfold at its own leisurely pace.  In truth, for my taste, the program runs a little long at five hours.  Less patient viewers might struggle with the first part and its lengthy set-up, but things heat up considerably the further into the miniseries you progress.  I respect Haynes' decision to modulate the narrative pacing--it certainly gives you more of an opportunity to get invested in the characterizations.  So even if you initially question where the story is going and how long it will take to get there, rest assured that patience will be rewarded.""Mildred Pierce,"" at heart, is a tale of mother love and sacrifice.  As Mildred, Kate Winslet seems a perfect muse to illuminate both the strength and the desperation inherent in the character.  Her devotion to daughter Veda can, at times, be challenging to understand--but the miniseries is much more able to flesh out the multi-layered dynamic that keeps Mildred from being a complete sap.  Veda is haughty, snobbish, and self-involved--and Mildred is both her willing victim and her enabler.  Mildred rises from broke housewife to restaurant entrepreneur, but is always a source of embarrassment to the entitled girl.  And through the show, the ladies contend with the various men in their lives including Brian F. O'Byrne as Veda's father and Guy Pearce as a carefree playboy that might just prove dangerous for the pair.Winslet gives a gritty and natural performance throughout.  Even as tensions rise, she maintains a grounded sensibility that keeps things from veering into overwrought territory.  Pearce has an oily allure and has turned into a really terrific character actor.  I loved, loved, loved young Morgan Turner as the girlhood Veda.  I laughed every time she said something.  She speaks with such haughty precision, but isn't quite the monster that Crawford had to deal with.  Perhaps the most difficult role to pull off in a naturalistic piece is the adult Veda.  We don't even see Evan Rachel Wood until the final episodes and she decides to lay it all on the line.  But oddly enough, this choice to go big absolutely heightens the drama of the concluding chapters.  Cain is known for sexually charged crime stories--The Postman Always Rings Twice and Double Indemnity, for example--and that is also territory that ""Mildred Pierce"" covers.  But where the movie led with a crime, Haynes' version builds to one.  And I think Cain would appreciate this decidedly less glamorous approach to his hard edged piece.  A beautiful production--this longer version is much like reading a fine novel, but might not be for those looking for instant gratification.

1381722,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0041KKZHI,M. Oleson,"[5, 11]","Normally, I wouldn't review a mini-series like this 5  hour HBO production.  Having watched the original 1945 film however, I thought it might be interesting to make a comparison.  Having never read the book, the film's premise is quite different.  The original film begins with a murder and plays like a Hitchcock who-done-it.  This newer version is more faithful to the novel from what I've read.  Frankly, I can understand the 1945 film wanting a bit more ""flavor"" to add some bite to what is a long story over many years.  The primary element is the bitter and difficult relationship between a mother and her daughter.  From my perspective both are seriously flawed.  What makes this overly long film special is Kate Winslet's performance as Mildred.  She shows the character as far more nuanced and interesting than Joan Crawford's take.  Naturally some of this has to do with the artistic freedom given modern films which allows Mildred to show, like most women, an outlet for sexual tension.  Winslet is given an opportunity for a full range of emotions.  The movie also has beautiful sets and costumes that effectively show a small town in post-war California.

The cars, houses, clothes, music, down to the two lane highways was a pretty accurate portrayal of the thirties.  I haven't seen the Joan Crawford version, but I think Kate Winslet could be her younger sister.  She really captures the mannerisms of Joan Crawford that I remember from other 1940s movies.  The character of Veda both as a child then into adulthood(Evan Rachel Wood) was evil, manipulative, and despicable, and one wanted to reach a hand through the screen and smack her upside the head!  It would be a hard role to do and it was done magnificently by both actresses.  Guy Pierce as the equally slick and also manipulative lothario, Monty, played that part with a lot of sexy overtones which were almost x-rated!  Kate Winslet as the main character, Mildred, was cast well and I felt a lot of empathy for her as she brought life to the part of a woman forced to provide for her family in an exhausting, demeaning job which in those days brought humiliation as men in the restaurant groped her as she tries to carry a bunch of plates.  She tries to keep her dignity by not revealing to her girls what her job is and hiding the uniforms.  It's heartbreaking to see her struggle to provide and be rebuffed by Veda who only wants the best and keeps wanting more and more.  Mildred desperately wants Veda to love her and goes to extremes which ultimately ruin her.  I especially loved the music of that era in the background.  It added a good dimension to the movie.

The real plot lies in the difficult relationship Mildred (the mother in question) has with her daughter, Veda, a spoiled, selfish child with dreams of grandeur who grows into a vapid, pretentious young woman.This mini-series is based on a novel written in 1941.  There was an earlier movie made, starring (I believe) Joan Crawford, but this miniseries is far more faithful to the novel.Kate Winselt deserved every award she won for this show.  She gives a wonderful performance as Mildred Pierce, the woman who sacrificed it all for her ungrateful daughter.  Evan Rachel Wood is eerie as Veda, the daughter who takes and takes and takes from Mildred until there is - quite literally - nothing left to take.I don't want to give anything away but I will say that I was left with an acute sense of unease at the end of the miniseries.  I found myself wishing for a part six, even though it was never included in the novel.

Yes, I enjoyed the writing and the storyline, but I wanted to step back into the 1930s to help with research for my new book The Timkers. I wanted to see how people dressed, lived and spoke to one another. What slang expressions did they use--especially in bed? How did they converse and interact between social and economic classes? Where did they eat, drive their cars and get their news? How did home kitchens work behind the scenes without benefit of microwave ovens? This HBO series was a dream come true in these respects. I do have one comment though. The cars were too clean--too well cared for. And the expression, &#34;...he went for the dairy?&#34; was priceless.As to the storyline, I found it interesting and compelling, but in the end, Ms. Pierce never seemed to learn that her daughter was, indeed a viper.",5,An Author's Dream,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,922,"['watched', 'miniseries', 'entirely', 'different', 'reason', 'most', 'people', 'see', ""'m"", 'author', 'Yes', 'enjoyed', 'writing', 'storyline', 'wanted', 'step', 'back', '1930s', 'help', 'research', 'new', 'book', 'Timkers', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'dressed', 'lived', 'spoke', 'one', 'What', 'slang', 'expressions', 'did', 'use', 'especially', 'bed', 'How', 'did', 'converse', 'interact', 'social', 'economic', 'classes', 'Where', 'did', 'eat', 'drive', 'cars', 'get', 'news', 'How', 'did', 'home', 'kitchens', 'work', 'scenes', 'benefit', 'microwave', 'ovens', 'HBO', 'series', 'was', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'respects', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'comment', 'cars', 'were', 'too', 'clean', 'too', 'well', 'cared', 'expression', '34', 'went', 'dairy', '34', 'was', 'priceless.As', 'storyline', 'found', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'end', 'Ms.', 'Pierce', 'never', 'seemed', 'learn', 'daughter', 'was', 'indeed', 'viper']",N/A
1381750,A25S4Q7KSTEW02,B0041KKZHI,W. Rodick,"[0, 0]","Impossible for me to watch this HBO series without considering how the original film was received in downtrodden working-class UK. I can only imagine how women aspired to Mildred's leadership. Her self confidence. Her will to live her dream. Echoes of Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice with its set-up of what women aspire to and what they have to settle for. Free from compliance. Being Joan Crawford. Kate Winslet's Mildred is more vulnerable.Part one of this five part series has all the pieces put in place. House, two kids, stray husband, separation, destitution in the background. Our first shock is her refusal to accept particular jobs. In a man's world only the Employment Exchange has a female boss. I have just finished watching Boardwalk Empire for the second time and could easily dove-tale the female lead in that series (Margaret) with Mildred Pierce. Both are attractive because of their self-confidence and their intelligence. Each speaks against the social norms of their time.The film must have reached Britain in the late 1940s. I can easily imagine my mum being impressed by the will to win. The strength of character. And all women of that time drooling over all that physical attention. The dream of control over a man and by a man. A suave, dapper, rich young man. Enter Guy Pierce. New fruit.I admit Boardwalk Empire is far more enjoyable for my male appreciation of booze, broads, guns and Al Capone but Mildred Pierce is very much story driven and does not allow you to settle to any conclusions very easily. I am half way through the series, I did not want to be loaded with the ending. Just to say that for women of a certain age you were remarkable. Five stars. Not like today.",4,Being a woman.
