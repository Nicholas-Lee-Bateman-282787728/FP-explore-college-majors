The only thing I'll say about buying it is that the episodes are too short with commercial lapses built into their structure--by this I mean they'll fade out of a scene and then fade back via the repetition of a small segment of tape. This can get a little annoying if you're watching them all in a row. The fact is though, I don't have time to read separate books on the Vikings, the Huns, and the Visigoths so I appreciate the insight that this collection provides. They're well done and very educational.

Amazon lists the aspect ratio as 1.33:1 and technically that is correct. But the DVDs are actually non-anamorphic letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame. Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery. Even cheap, direct-to-video DVD releases are in anamorphic format. I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.If you have an older home theater system, this set being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.Come on, History Channel, move your DVD releases into the 21st Century.",1,Letterboxed,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,867,"['review', 'DVDs', 'not', 'show.Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'set', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'Amazon', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.33:1', 'technically', 'correct', 'DVDs', 'are', 'actually', 'non-anamorphic', 'letterboxed', '16:9', 'matted', '4:3', 'frame', 'Why', 'History', 'Channel', 'use', 'outmoded', 'format', 'DVD', 'mystery', 'Even', 'cheap', 'direct-to-video', 'DVD', 'releases', 'are', 'anamorphic', 'format', 'can', 'author', 'disc', 'anamorphic', 'format', 'home', 'PC', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'hard', 'expensive', 'do.If', 'have', 'older', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'set', 'being', 'letterboxed', 'may', 'not', 'matter', 'have', 'HDTV', 'DVD', 'player', 'connected', 'HDMI', 'likely', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'other', 'letterbox', 'format', 'lowering', 'resolution', 'system.Come', 'History', 'Channel', 'move', 'DVD', '21st', 'Century']",Barbarians

It combines reenactments with expert historians' interviews, pulling the viewer into the past and making it seem like the present.  It's pop history.  What of it?  It gets you interested and encourages you to explore issues that interest you.  What struck me the most is these barbarians were brutalized by their neighboring empires, and had to develop guerrilla tactics to compete successfully.  Rome, for instance, wanted everyone and everything to bow down to it.  Why was its culture more important than the other ones?  Eventually, the conquering hordes made peace with their enemies and accepted their gods in order to get along and assimilate.

Thomas ""LibraryFiend""","[44, 50]","So, okay -- having Mongols depicted by actors who could have been anything from Hispanic to Caucasian and certainly not ""authentic"" Asians is relatively horrible, considering there cannot be a dearth of Asian/Asian-American actors who could have portrayed Genghis (or JENgis, as several of the historical experts were calling him in the program) far more realistically.Still, the History Channel did a commendable job of exploring the histories of the Vikings, Huns, Mongols, and Goths in this program.  While I cannot verify whether all the information provided is completely accurate, I doubt there are as many hugely glaring errors as other critics would make one believe.My only disappointment is that there were still unanswered questions about several things after having watched this series.  The name HUN -- is it related to the HAN dynasty of China that drove them westward...?  And what's the difference between an Ostrogoth and a Visigoth -- geography alone, or more?How did Kublai Kahn fit into the blood-drenched history of the Mongols?Finally, I would have liked seeing even a little coverage of other barbarous European tribes such as the Vandals, Gauls, Picts, Angles, Saxons, and Burgundians.At the end of the day ""Barbarians"" presents a decent documentary on a subject heretofore not covered and I found it largely enjoyable and educational.",3,Not as bad as others make it sound,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,1359,"['So', 'having', 'Mongols', 'depicted', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'anything', 'Hispanic', 'Caucasian', 'certainly', 'not', 'authentic', 'Asians', 'relatively', 'horrible', 'considering', 'there', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'dearth', 'Asian/Asian-American', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'portrayed', 'Genghis', 'JENgis', 'several', 'historical', 'experts', 'were', 'calling', 'program', 'far', 'more', 'realistically.Still', 'History', 'Channel', 'did', 'commendable', 'job', 'exploring', 'histories', 'Vikings', 'Huns', 'Mongols', 'Goths', 'program', 'can', 'not', 'verify', 'information', 'provided', 'completely', 'accurate', 'doubt', 'are', 'many', 'hugely', 'glaring', 'errors', 'other', 'critics', 'would', 'make', 'one', 'believe.My', 'only', 'disappointment', 'were', 'still', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'several', 'things', 'having', 'watched', 'series', 'name', 'HUN', 'related', 'HAN', 'dynasty', 'China', 'drove', 'westward', 'what', 'difference', 'Ostrogoth', 'Visigoth', 'geography', 'alone', 'more', 'How', 'did', 'Kublai', 'Kahn', 'fit', 'blood-drenched', 'history', 'Mongols', 'Finally', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'seeing', 'even', 'little', 'coverage', 'other', 'barbarous', 'European', 'tribes', 'such', 'Vandals', 'Gauls', 'Picts', 'Angles', 'Saxons', 'Burgundians.At', 'end', 'day', 'Barbarians', 'decent', 'documentary', 'subject', 'heretofore', 'not', 'covered', 'found', 'largely', 'enjoyable', 'educational']",Barbarians
793287,A2CZ953EHLEXWB,B00014WB1G,Old Gray Moose,"[0, 0]","I must say that when I bought the 4 DVD set of ""Barabarians"" I expected interesting but somewhat dry material with college professor types talking and some drawings and perhaps paintings depicting the various hordes under review. I was VERY pleasantly surprised to find out that the History Channel actually went to various locations around Europe and filmed actors portraying the hordes, the peasants, etc. In other words, this is as close to an actual glimpse and re-enactment of this period as you will ever see. Only Hollywood could top this set. There are 8 hordes represented and each horde runs about 45 minutes so there are 2 hordes per DVD.I learned A LOT about the period from 400 AD to 1300 AD when the Huns pressed into Eastern Europe and displaced tribes that fled from their advance and in doing so, became the ""Barbarians"" (e.g. Goths/Vandals/Lombards/etc.). You also get the Vikings, Saxons, and Mongols who all came a bit later but were no less influential in shaping modern day Europe.This is a part of history that was never covered in my public education. I guess it was just too dark and bloody. Ironic that the Black Death in 1349 actually ended the ""Dark Ages"" and ""reset"" Europe by killing about half the population.It is sad that the History Channel has had to branch into ""popular entertainment"" to stay afloat so I expect less of these type of ""magnum opus"" productions in the future.

There are several books that describe this. And his hordes weren't all Asiatics because many were descendants of the Sarmatians and even earlier the Scythians who were the first horse culture in basically the same region. They were blondes and dressed much like the later Germanic tribes as did the Sarmatians and a recent discovery in western China - the Tocharians (blondes & Nordic, Germanic-Celtic weaving/clothing, quite tall) - more commonly referred too as the 'Tarim Basin Mummies'.
