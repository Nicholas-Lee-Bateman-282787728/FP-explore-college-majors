1035334,A25JSZ7XF3KG92,B000KLQWN8,"B. Hauser ""B. Hauser""","[2, 2]","This is both a good introduction to Buddhism and a very personal film.  It centers on a community of Thai monks in New Zealand, I gather, though this was never quite explained.  Since English is a challenge for many of the monks, their interviews can be frustratingly simple and unsatisfying.  Fortunately, personable director-hostess-narrator Anna Wilding has done her homework, and leads us pleasantly through the history and some of the trickier aspects of Buddhism, such as the role of women.  Wilding is careful to differentiate between Buddhism's spiritual demands and what is merely local custom.  Some of it's a bit superficial and the production is very modest, but looking past those complaints, this is a valuable, loving, welcoming starting point for understanding one of the world's great religions.  Many of the details of Buddhism--the lotus blossoms, the hand gestures, the representations of Buddha himself--are explained for the outsider.  The biggest surprise was how worldly these monks are.  They travel all over the world, speak a number of languages, and have computers in their humble huts.  After seeing this film, I couldn't help wishing there were more films like this--about Islam and Christianity and Judaism to start--which might add to people's understanding.",4,Surprised and delighted,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,1290,"['good', 'introduction', 'Buddhism', 'very', 'personal', 'film', 'community', 'Thai', 'monks', 'New', 'Zealand', 'gather', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'explained', 'English', 'challenge', 'many', 'monks', 'interviews', 'can', 'be', 'frustratingly', 'simple', 'unsatisfying', 'Fortunately', 'personable', 'director-hostess-narrator', 'Anna', 'Wilding', 'done', 'homework', 'pleasantly', 'history', 'trickier', 'aspects', 'Buddhism', 'such', 'role', 'women', 'Wilding', 'careful', 'differentiate', 'Buddhism', 'spiritual', 'demands', 'what', 'merely', 'local', 'custom', 'bit', 'superficial', 'production', 'very', 'modest', 'looking', 'complaints', 'valuable', 'loving', 'welcoming', 'starting', 'point', 'understanding', 'one', 'world', 'great', 'religions', 'Many', 'details', 'Buddhism', 'lotus', 'blossoms', 'hand', 'gestures', 'representations', 'Buddha', 'are', 'explained', 'outsider', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'was', 'how', 'worldly', 'monks', 'are', 'travel', 'world', 'speak', 'number', 'languages', 'have', 'computers', 'humble', 'huts', 'seeing', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wishing', 'were', 'more', 'films', 'Islam', 'Christianity', 'Judaism', 'start', 'might', 'add', 'people', 'understanding']",N/A

With all the craziness in the world this is a pure spirituality.  This is a glimpse into a different way of life and thinking.

1035337,ATQDWTWVLLPFH,B000KLQWN8,Leann Harms,"[2, 2]","This is a thought provoking documentary that truly captures the collision of two very different cultures. It really makes you think about how you might feel if the roles were reversed and you had to adapt to an entirely different culture while still trying to maintain your identity and spiritual traditions. I thought the film thoroughly explored all aspects of this integration of cultures. I also thought it was quite fascinating to see how the monks lived in the monastery. This film was educational, enjoyable and uplifting at the same time. The film itself is well done and flows nicely at a good pace. Some documentaries tend to drag at points but this moved along very well. The only problem was that I wanted to see more by the time it got to the end - so I watched all the special features. I especially enjoyed the bit from the actual director. This is a highly affecting film for audiences of all religions and cultures.",5,Inspiring and Thought Provoking,1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,932,"['thought', 'provoking', 'documentary', 'truly', 'collision', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'cultures', 'really', 'think', 'how', 'might', 'feel', 'roles', 'were', 'reversed', 'had', 'adapt', 'entirely', 'different', 'culture', 'still', 'trying', 'maintain', 'identity', 'spiritual', 'traditions', 'thought', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'explored', 'aspects', 'integration', 'cultures', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'see', 'how', 'monks', 'lived', 'monastery', 'film', 'was', 'educational', 'enjoyable', 'uplifting', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'nicely', 'good', 'pace', 'documentaries', 'tend', 'drag', 'points', 'moved', 'along', 'very', 'well', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'time', 'got', 'end', 'so', 'watched', 'special', 'features', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'bit', 'actual', 'director', 'highly', 'affecting', 'film', 'audiences', 'religions', 'cultures']",N/A

The hut is like a small cabin, complete with books and a computer!  I never knew that some Buddhist monks were technologically savvy.  Most monks have university degrees and travel a lot.  Do monks really become more enlightened over the years?  When Anna asked Abbot he said, ""Just more understanding.""What I liked about this film is that it took the mystery and misunderstanding out of the life of a Buddhist monk and showed that they're simply people like all of us.  They struggle, they have good days and bad, but they always strive to do better, learn more, and be happier.
