1086601,A3PFMOTIGZN4VF,B000SK5ZKW,AD,"[9, 35]","I love the British ""Masterpiece Theater"" style drama series such as ""Upstairs, Downstairs"", so when I read the many glowing reviews of this series I bought it expecting to have another wonderful box set in that vein. But Monarch of the Glen turned out to be a huge disappointment.  For those who are expecting another series in the British tradition, the purpose of this review is to warn you.  There is nothing traditional about this show. It is a modern soap opera through and through.  Granted, it much more elaborately produced than typical in-studio soaps.  It is filmed on location, and the one thing the glowing reviews got right is the wonderful Scottish scenery and settings. It is even in widescreen, to better capture the breathtaking landscapes. I give a star for cinematography. But everything is downhill from there.This series is more like a British version of the 1970's/1980's American on-location soaps like Dallas and Falcon Crest, with some notable exceptions. First, it moves much more slowly than those action-packed soaps. Second, the directing is inferior to those American soaps. Third, the writing is not of the quality of those American soaps.  forth, it does not contain the expert acting of those soaps.  The last is the worst flaw of Monarch of the Glen. Don't expect professional acting. The actors in this series are soap opera grade actors, and they display all of the shortcomings of that approach to acting. The acting is more in line with American daytime soap operas than the mega productions like Dallas and Falcon Crest. Most of the actors lack emotional depth or the nuance and insight needed to flesh out their characters.  The acting style is mostly flat, and when the actors do try to inject some spark and emotion, it turns melodramatic.Another problem is the background music. Don't expect any hint of traditional celtic music here, as would fit the setting of this series.  The background music is often in the Kenny G. style of light jazz saxophone, which doesn't seem to fit.  There is also much slide guitar and dobro, which would be appropriate if the setting was Louisiana or Mississippi, but doesn't fit the Scottish highlands at all.  There are even spurts of wild heavy metal riffing that is totally out of place. And to make matters worse, there are interludes of that schmaltzy sythesizer music that permeates the daytime America soaps.Finally, the characters are flat, lack-luster and two-dimensional.  The writers can't seem to invent an interesting or believable character.  There is a feel of trendiness to many of the characters. You will see hipsters running around in kilts! Walls of the rooms of some characters are plastered with photos of mostly ugly punk rockers, rappers or other trendy teen idols.  Rather cliche and predictable, even hokey at times.  The character who comes closest to being interesting is the the aging patriarch of the estate, who is supposed to be an eccentric millionaire, but ends up often being just too goofy to be believable.  And his wife is way too spaced out to be real.I don't meant to dismiss this series out of hand.  I just want to warn lovers of the British tradition that this series will probably not be to their liking. Definitely do not expect something with a traditional British or Scottish feel. On the flip side of the coin, lovers of modern daytime soap operas will probably like or even love this series. However, be warned that even if you are a fan of the on-location American soaps like Dallas and Falcon Crest, you will probably be disappointed in Monarch of the Glen, because it is inferior in so many dimensions from those blockbuster American soaps.",1,"Not a Traditional Saga, But a Modern Soap Opera",1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,3669,"['love', 'British', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'style', 'drama', 'series', 'such', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'when', 'read', 'many', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'series', 'bought', 'expecting', 'have', 'wonderful', 'box', 'set', 'vein', 'Monarch', 'Glen', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'series', 'British', 'tradition', 'purpose', 'review', 'warn', 'nothing', 'traditional', 'show', 'modern', 'soap', 'opera', 'Granted', 'much', 'more', 'elaborately', 'produced', 'typical', 'in-studio', 'soaps', 'filmed', 'location', 'one', 'thing', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'got', 'right', 'wonderful', 'Scottish', 'scenery', 'settings', 'even', 'widescreen', 'better', 'capture', 'breathtaking', 'give', 'star', 'cinematography', 'everything', 'downhill', 'there.This', 'series', 'more', 'British', 'version', ""1970's/1980"", 'American', 'on-location', 'soaps', 'Dallas', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'First', 'much', 'more', 'slowly', 'action-packed', 'soaps', 'Second', 'directing', 'inferior', 'American', 'soaps', 'Third', 'writing', 'not', 'quality', 'American', 'soaps', 'forth', 'not', 'contain', 'expert', 'acting', 'soaps', 'last', 'worst', 'flaw', 'Monarch', 'Glen', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'professional', 'acting', 'actors', 'series', 'are', 'soap', 'opera', 'grade', 'actors', 'display', 'shortcomings', 'approach', 'acting', 'acting', 'more', 'line', 'American', 'daytime', 'soap', 'operas', 'mega', 'productions', 'Dallas', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'Most', 'actors', 'lack', 'emotional', 'depth', 'nuance', 'insight', 'needed', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'acting', 'style', 'mostly', 'flat', 'when', 'actors', 'do', 'try', 'inject', 'spark', 'emotion', 'melodramatic.Another', 'problem', 'background', 'music', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'hint', 'traditional', 'celtic', 'music', 'here', 'would', 'fit', 'setting', 'series', 'background', 'music', 'often', 'Kenny', 'G.', 'style', 'light', 'jazz', 'saxophone', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'also', 'much', 'slide', 'guitar', 'dobro', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'setting', 'was', 'Louisiana', 'Mississippi', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Scottish', 'highlands', 'are', 'even', 'spurts', 'wild', 'heavy', 'metal', 'riffing', 'totally', 'place', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'are', 'interludes', 'schmaltzy', 'sythesizer', 'music', 'daytime', 'America', 'soaps.Finally', 'characters', 'are', 'flat', 'lack-luster', 'two-dimensional', 'writers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'invent', 'interesting', 'believable', 'character', 'feel', 'trendiness', 'many', 'characters', 'will', 'see', 'hipsters', 'running', 'around', 'kilts', 'Walls', 'rooms', 'characters', 'are', 'plastered', 'photos', 'mostly', 'ugly', 'punk', 'rockers', 'rappers', 'other', 'trendy', 'teen', 'idols', 'cliche', 'predictable', 'even', 'hokey', 'times', 'character', 'who', 'closest', 'being', 'interesting', 'aging', 'patriarch', 'estate', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'eccentric', 'millionaire', 'up', 'often', 'being', 'just', 'too', 'goofy', 'be', 'believable', 'wife', 'way', 'too', 'spaced', 'out', 'be', 'real.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'meant', 'dismiss', 'series', 'hand', 'just', 'want', 'warn', 'lovers', 'British', 'tradition', 'series', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'liking', 'Definitely', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'something', 'traditional', 'British', 'Scottish', 'feel', 'flip', 'side', 'coin', 'lovers', 'modern', 'daytime', 'soap', 'operas', 'will', 'probably', 'even', 'love', 'series', 'However', 'be', 'warned', 'even', 'are', 'fan', 'on-location', 'American', 'soaps', 'Dallas', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Monarch', 'Glen', 'inferior', 'so', 'many', 'dimensions', 'blockbuster', 'American', 'soaps']",Monarch of the Glen: The Complete Collection

Since I'm in the process of planting trees, I enjoyed the segments that had to do with the woodlands.The plot is fun. There's a little bit of Scottish history thrown in for good measure. The accents can be a little hard to understand at times, but it doesn't take away from the story. In fact, I think I may be speaking with a Scottish accent now.  It's all a lot of fun. If you are looking for a serious story, this isn't it. When I try  to think of an American series to compare it with, I come up with a modern-day version of Little House on the Prarie done in Scotland, but then again, it isn't even close. These people are rich people 'struggling' to keep afloat. They neglect to mention that they have thousands and thousands of acres of land that they could sell at a moment's notice and feed their family, staff, and descendants for years to come. They can't do that of course, because it just isn't done. The land has been in their family for many hundreds of years. It's fun to watch what they think being broke means.

1086609,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B000SK5ZKW,FYI,"[16, 16]","The gorgeous northern landscape is an enormous, spectacular character in this Scottish saga. And of course, the Glenbogle manse is a major character of the story, from its rafters to its basement, it becomes the dream-home of many a viewer, the house we all wish we lived in (without the expenses). This series only improves upon further viewing, whatever the flaws of the human characters. I hesitated for years in making the commitment to watching this, fearing the twee. Now, I'm a Glenboglie, requiring repeat ""Monarch"" viewings every so often. The story involves a great deal more than Archie and his relationship issues, and the narrative evolves through each season.The elder statesmen are an especial delight, pitch-perfect, utterly believable: Hector, Golly, and Kilwillie. Hector's love of malt whisky legendary; what a pleasure it would be to sip Ardbeg with the gentleman, amidst snoring terriers before a crackling fire, with a good storm blowing over the loch. Angus Lennie, as Kilwillie's butler, is perfection, as in his timorous, ""I'd rather be taken prisioner by a gentleman, than free in a world gone mad!"" The addition of Paul a character adds another dimension, with Lloyd Owen's fine acting. One can only welcome the ripe addition of Tom Baker to the wonderful cast! Alexander Morton and the fine Rae Hendrie are superb, pitch-perfect throughout as Golly and his daughter. Nuance is everything; the majority of the cast are pros who deftly make the stories believable. Don't miss the Hogmanay Special (Season 5, Disk 3), a real haunted treat, with ghosts, and Paul dealing with his inheritance. Later episodes are replete with another select ghost. As other reviewers found, this is a captivating experience that induces indolence and relaxation, highly recommended.You may also enjoy:Hamish MacBeth: Series 1-3 Collection, andA History of Scotland.",5,Far from the Madding Crowd,1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,1871,"['gorgeous', 'northern', 'landscape', 'enormous', 'spectacular', 'character', 'Scottish', 'saga', 'course', 'Glenbogle', 'manse', 'major', 'character', 'story', 'rafters', 'basement', 'dream-home', 'many', 'viewer', 'house', 'wish', 'lived', 'expenses', 'series', 'only', 'further', 'viewing', 'whatever', 'flaws', 'human', 'characters', 'hesitated', 'years', 'making', 'commitment', 'watching', 'fearing', 'twee', 'Now', ""'m"", 'Glenboglie', 'requiring', 'repeat', 'Monarch', 'viewings', 'so', 'often', 'story', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'Archie', 'relationship', 'issues', 'narrative', 'evolves', 'season.The', 'elder', 'statesmen', 'are', 'especial', 'delight', 'pitch-perfect', 'utterly', 'believable', 'Hector', 'Golly', 'Kilwillie', 'Hector', 'love', 'malt', 'whisky', 'legendary', 'what', 'pleasure', 'would', 'be', 'sip', 'Ardbeg', 'gentleman', 'amidst', 'snoring', 'terriers', 'crackling', 'fire', 'good', 'storm', 'blowing', 'loch', 'Angus', 'Lennie', 'Kilwillie', 'butler', 'perfection', 'timorous', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'taken', 'prisioner', 'gentleman', 'free', 'world', 'gone', 'mad', 'addition', 'Paul', 'character', 'dimension', 'Lloyd', 'Owen', 'fine', 'acting', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'welcome', 'ripe', 'addition', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'Alexander', 'Morton', 'fine', 'Rae', 'Hendrie', 'are', 'superb', 'pitch-perfect', 'Golly', 'daughter', 'Nuance', 'everything', 'majority', 'cast', 'are', 'pros', 'who', 'deftly', 'make', 'stories', 'believable', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Hogmanay', 'Special', 'Season', '5', 'Disk', '3', 'real', 'haunted', 'treat', 'ghosts', 'Paul', 'dealing', 'inheritance', 'Later', 'episodes', 'are', 'replete', 'select', 'ghost', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'captivating', 'experience', 'indolence', 'relaxation', 'highly', 'recommended.You', 'may', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Hamish', 'MacBeth', 'Series', '1-3', 'Collection', 'andA', 'History', 'Scotland']",Monarch of the Glen: The Complete Collection

1086611,A38L1FZNX9MU0X,B000SK5ZKW,Harold A. Fretheim,"[13, 13]","This series captures the spirit of both the Highlands and of the three Compton Mackenzie books sometimes referred to as the Highland novels. Mackenzie has been described as the Scotttish Henry James but that does him an injustice- for he wrote a broader range of works than James and he was far more likely to use humor. Mackenzie did not think of MONARCH OF THE GLEN as a novel at all- he referred to it as a farce in his dedication. If you were looking for UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS then you would be disappointed for the story is intended to be light hearted and humerous, not a drama.  The series updates the stories by setting them 70 years later than the original works but the wonderful characters, wonderfully acted, are very true to Mackenzie's vision.  However, although this series is very well written the strain of translating that vision to a later time clearly shows at times.Their is one drawback that jars the veiwer who falls in love with the characters. It is a defect not of Mackenzie, or the show's writers or the actors but of British Television economics: It seems that almost no British television program can sign an actor to a long term commitment.  In the first two seasons we (and Archie) fall in love with Katrina- who is then abrubtly removed in the first episode of the third season (she briefly reappears in the middle of season four- and serves as the catalyst for the event that serves as the emotional high point of the whole series - I do not want to give too much away). Then Archie is gone by the middle of season five- and Lexie departs at the end of that season.  From the way that this happens it is clear that these departures were not originally planned.  And this is a shame- we have grown very fond of all of these characters and cheered them on as we watched them grow.Which is another thing about this series- this is not just humour in the highlands. The characters are very rich portrayals of very human people- and very well acted portrayals at that. The series, for all of its warts, is probably one of the finest series ever done on British television.",5,Great series but shows the drawbacks of British television,1290038400,"11 18, 2010",2010,2099,"['series', 'spirit', 'Highlands', 'three', 'Compton', 'Mackenzie', 'books', 'sometimes', 'referred', 'Highland', 'novels', 'Mackenzie', 'been', 'described', 'Scotttish', 'Henry', 'James', 'injustice-', 'wrote', 'broader', 'range', 'works', 'James', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'likely', 'use', 'humor', 'Mackenzie', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'MONARCH', 'THE', 'GLEN', 'novel', 'all-', 'referred', 'farce', 'dedication', 'were', 'looking', 'UPSTAIRS', 'DOWNSTAIRS', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'story', 'intended', 'be', 'light', 'hearted', 'humerous', 'not', 'drama', 'series', 'stories', 'setting', '70', 'years', 'later', 'original', 'works', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'are', 'very', 'true', 'Mackenzie', 'vision', 'However', 'series', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'strain', 'translating', 'vision', 'later', 'time', 'clearly', 'times.Their', 'one', 'drawback', 'veiwer', 'who', 'love', 'characters', 'defect', 'not', 'Mackenzie', 'show', 'writers', 'actors', 'British', 'Television', 'economics', 'almost', 'British', 'television', 'program', 'can', 'sign', 'actor', 'long', 'term', 'commitment', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Archie', 'fall', 'love', 'Katrina-', 'who', 'then', 'abrubtly', 'removed', 'first', 'episode', 'third', 'season', 'reappears', 'middle', 'season', 'four-', 'serves', 'catalyst', 'event', 'emotional', 'high', 'point', 'whole', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Then', 'Archie', 'gone', 'middle', 'season', 'five-', 'Lexie', 'departs', 'end', 'season', 'way', 'clear', 'departures', 'were', 'not', 'originally', 'planned', 'shame-', 'have', 'grown', 'very', 'fond', 'characters', 'cheered', 'watched', 'grow.Which', 'thing', 'series-', 'not', 'just', 'humour', 'highlands', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'rich', 'portrayals', 'very', 'human', 'people-', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'portrayals', 'series', 'warts', 'probably', 'one', 'finest', 'series', 'ever', 'done', 'British', 'television']",Monarch of the Glen: The Complete Collection

It's all in a small package of ""ONLY"" 18 DVDs. Why only?  After 58 hours of feature followed by great bonus material, you will want MORE. Do the math.  Cost divided by length, it's the best bargain for peak perfection of British Drama/Comedy available.Archie, the inheriting Laird, decides to save the Glenbogle estate. Throughout the 7 years of episodes (you'll be glad you now don't have to wait a week between episodes), he finds help and enemies aplenty. He finds anguish and love. Some of the stars will die within the script, others will move on, and new characters will replace the void. It is never static, never boring, always lush for the eyes, and filled throughout will drama, laughs, and the feeling that you have been accepted into this MacDonald family of the Highlands.Golly Mackenzie (Alexander Morton) is the gillie, and the anchor to Glenbogle land. He remains through all 7 years of production.  Susan Hampshire (Lady Glencora in ""The Pallisers""; also in ""The Grand"") plays Molly, wife of the original Laird, Hector.  She also lives with the program from beginning to end. She is dynamic. She is the queen of Glenbogle. Her costumes go from riches to rags depending upon her activity, but is always powerful and lovely.Duncan and Lexie are two of the estate's hired help that become huge in the story as well as delightful characters played so well that they sometimes upstage even the scenery. Due to their performances, certain episodes were written around their character, and Lexie eventually _____________ even. There are other important characters that are removed from the story and you wonder how the series will survive without them. But it does, and seems to better itself with the aging process, like all good Scotch.This DVD set is an investment, one you'll never regret, even after the second and third viewing.

Most of the lead actors in this series felt compelled to broaden the Scot accent to the point of being unintelligible - particularly the actress portraying Lexie.  Add to this a sound engineer who couldn't keep the volume at a steady consistency so you have to constantly be turning it up or down.Further, I found all of the characters one dimensional which resulted in being bored or irritated.  Duncan runs with kilt flying throughout.  He is portrayed as a bumbling dunce who never learns and is constantly putting plans afoul.  Susan Hampshire as Molly is a mature pixie - not a pleasant picture and rather a contradiction in terms.  Lexie struts, bounces, attempts a flirtatious way (which fails) with any and all in her path.  Maybe it would work if one could understand one in ten words that she utters.  Then there is the stoic Golly who lends nothing other than a silent, staring brooding stereotype of a Scot.  He too mumbles throughout.The scenery is lovely but not worth this many hours of viewing.Here is a sample of the language spoken so you have a frame of reference for what you're in for. &#34; Bine Uh Ja &#34;- Lexie saying  &#34; Behind You.&#34;  &#34;Ay Ed Ugh&#34; -  Once again, Lexie saying  &#34;I do&#34;Juding from all the other glowing reviews I accept being in the minority but I for one would NEVER want to watch this series again - once was far more than enough.",3,Need an Interpreter & volume control with you throughout entire series,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,1480,"['First', 'have', 'excellent', 'hearing', 'complaints', 'are', 'not', 'due', 'factor', 'Most', 'lead', 'actors', 'series', 'felt', 'compelled', 'broaden', 'Scot', 'accent', 'point', 'being', 'unintelligible', 'particularly', 'actress', 'portraying', 'Lexie', 'Add', 'sound', 'engineer', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'volume', 'steady', 'consistency', 'have', 'constantly', 'be', 'turning', 'up', 'down.Further', 'found', 'characters', 'one', 'dimensional', 'resulted', 'being', 'bored', 'irritated', 'Duncan', 'runs', 'kilt', 'flying', 'portrayed', 'bumbling', 'dunce', 'who', 'never', 'learns', 'constantly', 'putting', 'plans', 'afoul', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'Molly', 'mature', 'pixie', 'not', 'pleasant', 'picture', 'rather', 'contradiction', 'terms', 'Lexie', 'struts', 'bounces', 'flirtatious', 'way', 'path', 'would', 'work', 'one', 'could', 'understand', 'one', 'ten', 'words', 'utters', 'Then', 'stoic', 'Golly', 'who', 'nothing', 'other', 'silent', 'staring', 'brooding', 'stereotype', 'Scot', 'too', 'throughout.The', 'scenery', 'lovely', 'not', 'many', 'hours', 'sample', 'language', 'spoken', 'so', 'have', 'frame', 'reference', 'what', ""'re"", '34', 'Bine', 'Uh', 'Ja', '34', 'Lexie', 'saying', '34', 'Behind', 'You.', '34', '34', 'Ay', 'Ed', 'Ugh', '34', 'Once', 'again', 'Lexie', 'saying', '34', 'do', '34', 'Juding', 'other', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'accept', 'being', 'minority', 'one', 'would', 'NEVER', 'want', 'watch', 'series', 'again', 'once', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'enough']",Monarch of the Glen: The Complete Collection
1086620,A2MLP4UGTF1RX4,B000SK5ZKW,"M. FUSCO ""yawnmower""","[28, 40]","I have watched five of the seven seasons of this series (there is a change of cast in the last two).The cast is a first rate collection of characters: feisty lord of the manor Hector; charming upper crust wife Molly; rebellious son Archie whose title is thrust upon him; a castle full of eccentric family retainers.  For the first two seasons, the stories mainly involve their day-to-day fights and resolutions.  Outside visitors rarely come off well.  The 'city dwellers', such as Archie's girl-friend and business partner from London, are invariably selfish, conniving, scheming social climbers who are soon defeated by the 'honest values' of the country.By the third season -- after Hector's death at the hands (or should I say paws) of his dog -- the series becomes a caricature of itself, not to mention cloying, contrived, and without the easy humor which characterized the first two.  At first, Archie (good-looking Alastair Mackenzie) flirts with all the girls and they fight over him.  In the third season, he marries exuberant housekeeper Lexie, who was delightfully confrontational and fun for two seasons, teasing all the boys and bringing them down a peg or two.  She becomes a shrewish, over-protective, jealous ball-and-chain.  Similarly, inexperienced houseman (with double-digit IQ) Duncan is cute and cuddly at first, but becomes simply foolish and annoyingly inept -- even dangerous.  In one episode he manages to get the castle bombed and its contents burgled.  In another he backs into a public van, drives off while it rolls down the hill and crashes into a tree, then blithely wanders off to let everyone else take the blame.  When he finds himself in a gay bar in Glasgow, his behavior -- no matter what the producers may think -- is offensive and stupid rather than humorous.As far as the Laird of the manor is concerned, Archie rejects his role to begin with, charmingly so, but learns to love the broken-down old estate and gets the place back on its feet.  After marriage, he becomes stubborn, patronizing, snobbish, secretive, uber-macho, and deaf to anyone's problems but his own.  He unceremoniously evicts the estate's fifth-generation ghillie from his cottage to make way for a paying tenant, then lets him walk away when the poor man reveals that he has a debilitating eye disease.  Archie relents in the end, of course, but only after way too much unnecessary anguish and condescension.  Maybe there is something in the water, because even Archie's initially self-effacing half-brother becomes a pompous, overbearing know-it-all as soon as he sets foot on the estate.The ghillie (wonderful Alexander Morton) is not only the sexiest sexagenarian on television, but the only character in this series with any real integrity or consistency.  The other characters only display those qualities by default, or when forced into it.There are several important things wrong with Monarch.  First:  way too many class snobs and far too much 'noblesse oblige'.  Second, too many plots involving the 'education' of the upper classes, and lessons in humility taught by 'wiser' underlings.  Third:  too many episodes in which an injured party sulks and walks off in a snit, making everyone's life miserable in the meantime.  Four:  too many episodes in which Molly saves the day through some inadvertent knowledge of an evil-doer and a little blackmail.  Five:  WAY too many episodes when a character deceives everyone for his own purposes, only to be discovered in the deception at the last minute and learning an 'important lesson'.  Suffice it to say, there is a fine line between farcical situations played for humor and cloying incompetence.  All too often, this series does not know the difference.The finale of the fourth season is a real corker, but it comes only after 18 of the most tedious, morally questionable, and predictable episodes of the series.  The finale of the fifth series just fizzles out, and all relationships ring hollow.  There is something decidedly not funny about three clan clowns replacing a father's ashes (in what is meant to be, I suppose, a merry little mix-up) with those from a barbecue pit.",3,Great scenery chewed up by a hungry cast,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,4150,"['have', 'watched', 'five', 'seven', 'seasons', 'series', 'change', 'cast', 'last', 'two', '.The', 'cast', 'first', 'rate', 'collection', 'characters', 'feisty', 'lord', 'manor', 'Hector', 'charming', 'upper', 'crust', 'wife', 'Molly', 'rebellious', 'son', 'Archie', 'title', 'thrust', 'castle', 'full', 'eccentric', 'family', 'retainers', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'stories', 'mainly', 'involve', 'day-to-day', 'fights', 'resolutions', 'visitors', 'rarely', 'come', 'off', 'well', ""'city"", 'dwellers', 'such', 'Archie', 'girl-friend', 'business', 'partner', 'London', 'are', 'invariably', 'selfish', 'conniving', 'scheming', 'social', 'climbers', 'who', 'are', 'soon', 'defeated', ""'honest"", 'values', ""'"", 'country.By', 'third', 'season', 'Hector', 'death', 'hands', 'should', 'say', 'paws', 'dog', 'series', 'caricature', 'not', 'mention', 'cloying', 'contrived', 'easy', 'humor', 'characterized', 'first', 'two', 'first', 'Archie', 'good-looking', 'Alastair', 'Mackenzie', 'girls', 'fight', 'third', 'season', 'exuberant', 'housekeeper', 'Lexie', 'who', 'was', 'delightfully', 'confrontational', 'fun', 'two', 'seasons', 'teasing', 'boys', 'bringing', 'down', 'peg', 'two', 'shrewish', 'over-protective', 'jealous', 'ball-and-chain', 'Similarly', 'inexperienced', 'houseman', 'double-digit', 'IQ', 'Duncan', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'first', 'simply', 'foolish', 'annoyingly', 'inept', 'even', 'dangerous', 'one', 'episode', 'get', 'castle', 'bombed', 'contents', 'burgled', 'public', 'van', 'off', 'down', 'hill', 'crashes', 'tree', 'then', 'blithely', 'let', 'everyone', 'else', 'take', 'blame', 'When', 'gay', 'bar', 'Glasgow', 'behavior', 'matter', 'what', 'producers', 'may', 'think', 'offensive', 'stupid', 'rather', 'humorous.As', 'far', 'Laird', 'manor', 'concerned', 'Archie', 'role', 'begin', 'charmingly', 'so', 'love', 'broken-down', 'old', 'estate', 'place', 'back', 'feet', 'marriage', 'stubborn', 'patronizing', 'snobbish', 'secretive', 'uber-macho', 'deaf', 'anyone', 'problems', 'own', 'unceremoniously', 'estate', 'fifth-generation', 'ghillie', 'cottage', 'make', 'way', 'paying', 'tenant', 'then', 'walk', 'away', 'when', 'poor', 'man', 'reveals', 'debilitating', 'eye', 'disease', 'Archie', 'relents', 'end', 'course', 'only', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'anguish', 'condescension', 'Maybe', 'something', 'water', 'even', 'Archie', 'initially', 'self-effacing', 'half-brother', 'pompous', 'overbearing', 'know-it-all', 'as', 'soon', 'foot', 'estate.The', 'ghillie', 'wonderful', 'Alexander', 'Morton', 'not', 'only', 'sexiest', 'sexagenarian', 'television', 'only', 'character', 'series', 'real', 'integrity', 'consistency', 'other', 'characters', 'only', 'display', 'qualities', 'default', 'when', 'forced', 'are', 'several', 'important', 'things', 'wrong', 'Monarch', 'First', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'class', 'snobs', 'far', 'too', 'much', ""'noblesse"", 'oblige', 'Second', 'too', 'many', 'plots', 'involving', ""'education"", 'upper', 'classes', 'lessons', 'humility', 'taught', ""'wiser"", 'underlings', 'Third', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'injured', 'party', 'sulks', 'walks', 'off', 'snit', 'making', 'everyone', 'life', 'miserable', 'meantime', 'Four', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'Molly', 'day', 'inadvertent', 'knowledge', 'evil-doer', 'little', 'blackmail', 'Five', 'WAY', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'when', 'character', 'everyone', 'own', 'purposes', 'only', 'be', 'discovered', 'deception', 'last', 'minute', 'learning', ""'important"", 'lesson', 'Suffice', 'say', 'fine', 'line', 'farcical', 'situations', 'played', 'humor', 'cloying', 'incompetence', 'too', 'often', 'series', 'not', 'know', 'difference.The', 'finale', 'fourth', 'season', 'real', 'corker', 'only', '18', 'most', 'tedious', 'morally', 'questionable', 'predictable', 'episodes', 'series', 'finale', 'fifth', 'series', 'just', 'out', 'relationships', 'ring', 'hollow', 'something', 'decidedly', 'not', 'funny', 'three', 'clan', 'clowns', 'replacing', 'father', 'ashes', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'suppose', 'merry', 'little', 'mix-up', 'barbecue', 'pit']",Monarch of the Glen: The Complete Collection

But don't waste your time with the last two seasons.  If you watch, you will know why.  It falls short of the appeal of the first several seasons in many ways.  The cast of characters for one is SPOILER ALERT:  DO NOT READ IF U DONT WANT TO KNOW!!mostly new and some annoying new stupid twists to the storyline.RESUME HERE:  This however, overall is wonderfully entertaining, each episode something happens which is resolved by the end of the episode.

1086624,A1CN1P7147QDJC,B000SK5ZKW,My Amazon Reviews,"[6, 7]","It you have ever wondered what it would be like to live in and run your own  Scottish castle, this is the series for you! The first many years of the series are excellent. As 1 reviewer noted, the last 2 seasons lost some of their pizazz with a couple of the main characters making an exit from the show. The viewer is left thinking, yea, it is time for this series to end. Nevertheless, this is one of my family's top 5 favorite shows.The episodes are engaging with beautiful scenery and interesting plots about the daily lives of the castle owners and their staff, and the decisions they have to make with in their personal lives while trying to keep an expensive castle and acreage running and profitable.Archie, the son, returns to help his parents run the estate. And the plot thickens from there with ideas like introducing wolves to the estate to attract tourists. Archie always has a slew of women interested in him and one of them finally captures his heart and they tie the knot. The drama of running the castle is interjected with humor and the crazy antics of the characters. A good mix of humor and drama.There really is no American TV show to compare this to, it is simply unique and entertaining in a way Americans will enjoy and never see on American TV.

There are a few more ahead of me, but I've peeked online and read what is to come.  No surprises await me.When Season 1 began, I was quickly drawn into the story and the lives of all the players with great interest.  Archie, the reluctant Laird, is a keen personality drawn home to a position he doesn't care to hold.  The family estate is bankrupt, his father is in denial of the problems, and his mother schemes to keep Archie back home.  Archie, however, is determined to make it a short visit and hopes to return to his overbearing girlfriend and entrepreneurship as a restaurant owner in London.As the story ensues, he is sucked back into the world of his childhood and the ghosts of his dead ancestors who are determined to make him face up to his responsibilities (really there are no ghosts).  Events lead to just that - he abandons his life in London and roots himself back into his heritage.  His family and the staff are an eclectic mixture of personalities, as well as friends, girlfriends, and potential loves.  The first three seasons I thoroughly enjoyed, but as the seasons continued on, I found myself losing interest.Archie's first love interest, Katrina, made a great angst-filled love story of two personalities clashing together, who were both too proud to admit their feelings.  When they finally do, the actress who plays the part leaves the show, and we are left with Archie once again seeking to adjust.Lexie, the cook and housemaid, has her eyes on Archie; but, of course, the class separation looms before her as an obstacle.  Hector, his father, and Molly his mother, are wonderful characters in their own right.  The series focuses upon their intent to get the estate out of debt before the bank forecloses and forces them to sell.  As the series continues with its ups and downs of trying to save the estate, humorous and lighthearted stories continue to entertain. There are a few characters I grew to dislike, especially from the bank!For some reason, I found the series losing steam toward the end.  Huge changes in casting and storyline occurred, and the blending of the characters you've come to love, suddenly unravel. People leave the show, replacements come in, and things change.  I think, too, I wasn't exactly overwhelmed over Archie's choice of a love interest.  For so long there was no spark between the two, and then suddenly he confesses he's loved her all along. The emotionless expression on his face gave me the impression he was settling rather than being head-over-heels in love, which is the story I would have preferred to see.  There just wasn't a spark.  It felt forced.In any event, it's a good and entertaining series.  The Scottish history and heritage is an interesting watch.  The scenery is absolutely breathtaking and makes me want to visit Scotland the next time I cross the pond.
