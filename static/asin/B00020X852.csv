It's not like these are gonna sit on your shelf forever like most shows or movies would. Plus people will be borrowing them all the time.I won't talk too much about the show other than to say it's extremely hilarious. The DVDs themselves do not have too much additional stuff, which was somewaht dissapointing. There were a couple extra scenes that were funny but I can see why they were cut out of the show. The voice over narration is pretty bad. Sacha was okay but not very funny and the other guy was[...]. The only good part of the narration was how Sacha described how he meets, in character of course, each guest before each interview and acts like a complete idiot who has no idea what he is doing, which makes it more understandable how these fools can put up with him for so long and actually take him seriously.Persoanlly, I wish their were more deleted scenes, there must be more stuff out there. It would have been great if they put some of his old british material on there but maybe they are planning to release all that stuff sometime.Best parts -- Philly police academy and Ali G shopping his TV show to the networks.

Clearly not for everybody, and many of the jokes within poke fun in a similar fashion at sacred cows in the 'US and A', as Borat would have it.

However, with Da Ali G Show, I have to un ambiguously say that I have no qualms about buying the DVD.If you have not heard about Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen), here is the basic rundown.  The show is broken down into three concepts following three personas: (1) Hip-hop British interviewer Ali G., (2) Kazikstani reporter apparently stuck in the 70's Borat, and (3) German fashion club-kid Bruno.  The general M.O. is to find unsuspecting interviewees from areas ranging from entertainment to religion to politics.  The interviews seem to go smoothly, lulling the interviewee into a false comfort.  Then, the interviews veer into absurd directions to see how far the interviewers can be taken off course before pulling the plug.  Granted, the concept does not sound all that interesting, the execution is brilliant.The result is getting to see a range of the absurd from Edwin Meese and Boutros Boutros Gali attempt (rather unsuccessfully) to rap to a debate about religion which degenerates into an arguement about which of the panel members cloged the backstage toilet.If you cannot tell from the foregoing description, let me emphasize this point (with all-caps no less):THIS DVD IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!!Many people will not find this schtick funny.  It relies heavily on satire as well as somewhat juvenille humor.  If this is not your cup of tea, I can definitely understand and would not recommend it to you.Given that, however, I found it very funny and was glad that I bought it.",5,"Not for everyone, but I found it extremely funny",1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,1622,"['am', 'often', 'very', 'ambidexerous', 'reviews', 'pointing', 'out', 'what', 'like', 'other', 'hand', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'certain', 'product', 'However', 'Da', 'Ali', 'G', 'Show', 'have', 'un', 'ambiguously', 'say', 'have', 'qualms', 'buying', 'DVD.If', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'Ali', 'G', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'here', 'basic', 'rundown', 'show', 'broken', 'down', 'three', 'concepts', 'following', 'three', 'personas', '1', 'Hip-hop', 'British', 'interviewer', 'Ali', 'G.', '2', 'Kazikstani', 'reporter', 'apparently', 'stuck', '70', 'Borat', '3', 'German', 'fashion', 'club-kid', 'Bruno', 'general', 'M.O', 'find', 'unsuspecting', 'interviewees', 'areas', 'ranging', 'entertainment', 'religion', 'politics', 'interviews', 'seem', 'go', 'smoothly', 'lulling', 'interviewee', 'false', 'comfort', 'Then', 'interviews', 'veer', 'absurd', 'directions', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'interviewers', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'off', 'course', 'pulling', 'plug', 'Granted', 'concept', 'not', 'sound', 'interesting', 'execution', 'brilliant.The', 'result', 'getting', 'see', 'range', 'absurd', 'Edwin', 'Meese', 'Boutros', 'Boutros', 'Gali', 'attempt', 'rather', 'unsuccessfully', 'rap', 'debate', 'religion', 'arguement', 'panel', 'members', 'cloged', 'backstage', 'toilet.If', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'foregoing', 'description', 'let', 'emphasize', 'point', 'all-caps', 'less', 'DVD', 'IS', 'NOT', 'FOR', 'EVERYONE', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'schtick', 'funny', 'heavily', 'satire', 'as', 'well', 'somewhat', 'juvenille', 'humor', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'can', 'definitely', 'understand', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'you.Given', 'however', 'found', 'very', 'funny', 'was', 'glad', 'bought']",Da Ali G Show - The Complete First Season

Ali G, who gets the most screen time, is a white rapper, Borat is a misogynistic, anti-Semitic reporter from Kazahkstan, and Bruno is a gay fashion journalist from Austria.  All of them are completely clueless, subjecting their interviewees (who are not in on the joke) to idiotic questions and inappropriate statements.Although Cohen's characters are idiots, Cohen himself is clearly a gifted and perceptive comedian--not to mention an occasionally courageous one, as he demonstrates when he dances along with the cheerleaders at a football game in the deep South as Bruno while spectators shout epithets at him from the sidelines.  Much of the humor comes from the disbelieving reactions of his subjects, but there are also occasional moments of brilliance when Cohen uses apparently unintelligent comments to expose pretense and self-importance.  The best of these moments are provided when Bruno interviews designers at a fashion show; his fawning admiration and obsequious questions prompts them to expose themselves as vacuous and elitist./",5,Big up yourself!,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,1254,"['British', 'comedian', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'famous', 'names', 'news', 'man', 'street', 'series', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'interviews', 'conducted', 'guise', 'three', 'different', 'comic', 'personas', 'Ali', 'G', 'who', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'white', 'rapper', 'Borat', 'misogynistic', 'anti-Semitic', 'reporter', 'Kazahkstan', 'Bruno', 'gay', 'fashion', 'journalist', 'Austria', 'are', 'completely', 'clueless', 'subjecting', 'interviewees', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'joke', 'idiotic', 'questions', 'inappropriate', 'statements.Although', 'Cohen', 'characters', 'are', 'idiots', 'Cohen', 'clearly', 'gifted', 'perceptive', 'comedian', 'not', 'mention', 'occasionally', 'courageous', 'one', 'when', 'along', 'cheerleaders', 'football', 'game', 'deep', 'South', 'Bruno', 'spectators', 'shout', 'epithets', 'sidelines', 'Much', 'humor', 'disbelieving', 'reactions', 'subjects', 'are', 'also', 'occasional', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'when', 'Cohen', 'apparently', 'unintelligent', 'comments', 'expose', 'pretense', 'self-importance', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'provided', 'when', 'Bruno', 'designers', 'fashion', 'show', 'fawning', 'admiration', 'obsequious', 'questions', 'prompts', 'expose', 'vacuous', 'elitist./']",Da Ali G Show - The Complete First Season

But I should mention that the humor really grows on you, and requires repeat viewings to catch all the double entendre and hidden jokes.  Also, many of the jokes have to be heard two or three times, before they become as funny as they truly are.  And believe me, they are hysterical.Ali G is just one of the three characters played by Sacha Baron Cohen.  A British humorist, from London presumably, this DVD is one funny show.  Hard to believe that a Jewish man, from England, could play a ""white Americaninized rapper"" but play he does; with the minds and imaginations of many famous and important people.  I cannot believe that he gets Boutros Boutros Kahli to rap?  Amazing.I first heard of this DVD/show from the star's interview on the Howard Stern show, and I was instantly entranced.  I am a big fan of the ""hidden camera"" type shows (please see my other reviews) from the likes of Jamie Kennedy, and others, and assumed that this was the same type of show.  But what is amazing is that everyone on the set knows they are being filmed, and yet, they continue to sit there, and take his abuse.Howard Stern asked him his method of obtaining interviews, and Mr. Cohen could not reveal his secret for fear of not being able to repeat the process.  However, it is clear, after viewing, Mr. Cohen is an expert ad-libber, and a very funny comedienne.  He has my vote for funniest person from England.My second favorite character is Bruno, the sexually confused high profile personality interviewer from Austria.  He is brilliantly inept, and quite stupid.  The fact that he more often interviews secondary no-body's, and doesn't get near anyone remotely famous, makes it even funnier.  In one segment he is interviewing the owner of a fancy boutique, and he tells him, presumably when the film isn't rolling, to say that Madonna comes to his shop on a regular basis, 'cuz zat is much more interesting for 'ze viewers.'  HILARIOUS!!!Lastly is Borat, a Kazakhstan TV reporter who seems to limit his low command of the English Language to only the most embarrassing subjects and questions, much to the chagrin of those being interviewed.  I find it hard to believe this man would even be married in his home country, but showing naked pictures of his ""wife"" to complete strangers is not past him.  Watching him run down the streets of Manhattan after taxis is funny, and stupid at the same time.  Supposedly his shows are telecast in his home country, and I suspect his ""innocent foreigner"" questions are what help to warm him up to his ""victims.""  We Americans are quite trusting.Season 2 was just released last Tuesday, 9/13/2005, and I await my UMD version from Amazon.  Hopefully, I'll follow up with a review sometime next week.

Da Ali G character is so ingenious and yet so simple, an english baller with all the street vernacular and the IQ of a rock. One of the funniest scenes from the 1st season has to be when Ali G visits the United Nations and asks the former chief ""So, is Disney World part of the United Nations?"" The man answers ""No, Disney World is not a state, it has characters and nothing to do with politics."" Ali G replies ""Well some of dem characters are like political...you know what I'm sayin'."" Borat's guide to America is consistently the funniest part of Da Ali G show. Here Sasha portrays a television reporter from Kazikastan(sp?) who has absolutely no shame or clue about American culture and customs. The two funniest parts with Borat have to be when he goes to visit the minor league baseball team and his dinner with a group of refined older people. During that dinner he leans over to a woman who is like 90 and says ""I had sex last night...it was good."" Bruno is Sasha's gay fashion reporter who stirs up trouble everywhere he goes.

This is season 1 of his show which preceded the movie. I did not know much about it beforehand, but my sister recommended it.It is pretty funny, though at some points I felt embarrased for some of the guests/victims. In a nutshell, one of three of Sasha's characters (Ali G) will talk to someone about a fairly important subject but in a really stupid way - such as with C. Everett Koop (Surgeon General) about the possibility of implanting a programmable cell phone in your chest to make you heart beat with a more appealing ""rap-like"" beat. Another guest was astronaut Buzz Aldrin (called ""the geezer Buzz Lightyear"") who was asked if man would ever walk on the sun. ""No, it's too hot"". ""Well, what about in the winter...when it's colder?"" Another character, ""Borat"", will interact with people and use the (fake) culture gap to push the limits of bad taste - such as at a dinner, announcing to an old couple that he had sex last night - with his sister. In another case he goes on and on (and on) about how in his country they say ""when a horse walks, he walks like a man. And when a horse cries, he cries like...a man. And when a horse..."" for about 2 minutes while some equestrian woman smiles and nods. Or he sings the (fake) Kazikstani national anthem at a minor league baseball game - for about 3 minutes as the standing crowd gets restless. His third character ""Bruno"" is sort of a gay fashionista, and actually manages to get on the catwalk to model long underwear and ends up doing the ""worm"" - when he's not propositioning some 50-year old man.Finally in a TV ""round table"" discussion about ""compooter tekmology"", Ali accuses a person of leaving something in the toilet backstage. He also got United Nations Sec'y General ""Boutros Boutros Boutros"" (yes, 3 times) Ghali to spell the equivalent French slang word for excrement.Only Donald Trump figured him out early and excused himself, and former presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told the cameraman ""this guy's an idiot!"" after being asked repeatedly if Hilary Rodham Clinton was ""a carpet muncher"" or some such word.Funny, but best in small doses.",5,Embarassing and funny,1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,2220,"['suppose', 'everyone', 'familiar', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'fake', 'documentary', 'movie', 'Borat', 'season', '1', 'show', 'preceded', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'beforehand', 'sister', 'recommended', 'it.It', 'pretty', 'funny', 'though', 'points', 'felt', 'embarrased', 'guests/victims', 'nutshell', 'one', 'three', 'Sasha', 'characters', 'Ali', 'G', 'will', 'talk', 'someone', 'fairly', 'important', 'subject', 'really', 'stupid', 'way', 'such', 'C.', 'Everett', 'Koop', 'Surgeon', 'General', 'possibility', 'implanting', 'programmable', 'cell', 'phone', 'chest', 'make', 'heart', 'beat', 'more', 'appealing', 'rap-like', 'beat', 'guest', 'was', 'astronaut', 'Buzz', 'Aldrin', 'called', 'geezer', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'who', 'was', 'asked', 'man', 'would', 'ever', 'walk', 'sun', 'No', 'too', 'hot', 'Well', 'what', 'winter', 'when', 'colder', 'character', 'Borat', 'will', 'interact', 'people', 'use', 'fake', 'culture', 'gap', 'push', 'limits', 'bad', 'taste', 'such', 'dinner', 'announcing', 'old', 'couple', 'had', 'sex', 'last', 'night', 'sister', 'case', 'how', 'country', 'say', 'when', 'horse', 'walks', 'man', 'when', 'horse', 'cries', 'man', 'when', 'horse', '2', 'minutes', 'equestrian', 'woman', 'smiles', 'nods', 'fake', 'Kazikstani', 'national', 'anthem', 'minor', 'league', 'baseball', 'game', '3', 'minutes', 'standing', 'crowd', 'restless', 'third', 'character', 'Bruno', 'sort', 'gay', 'fashionista', 'actually', 'manages', 'get', 'catwalk', 'model', 'long', 'underwear', 'up', 'doing', 'worm', 'when', 'not', 'propositioning', '50-year', 'old', 'man.Finally', 'TV', 'round', 'table', 'discussion', 'compooter', 'tekmology', 'Ali', 'person', 'leaving', 'something', 'toilet', 'backstage', 'also', 'got', 'United', 'Nations', 'Sec', 'y', 'General', 'Boutros', 'Boutros', 'Boutros', 'yes', '3', 'times', 'Ghali', 'spell', 'equivalent', 'French', 'slang', 'word', 'excrement.Only', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'figured', 'out', 'early', 'excused', 'former', 'presidential', 'press', 'secretary', 'Marlin', 'Fitzwater', 'told', 'cameraman', 'guy', 'idiot', 'being', 'asked', 'repeatedly', 'Hilary', 'Rodham', 'Clinton', 'was', 'carpet', 'muncher', 'such', 'word.Funny', 'best', 'small', 'doses']",Da Ali G Show - The Complete First Season

Somehow this guy gets interviews with some of the most important people of our time.  The entertaining part about it is Ali-G's interview style.  He has 3 characters that he changes in to for his talks:Ali-G - Gangster type loves rappers Biggie, Tupac, PDiddy.  My favorite interview was with C. Everett Coop, former Surgeon General.  At one point Coop calls him a complete moron.  I often wonder if he lets them off the hook at the end of the interview?Borat - From Kazikstan, he often fills his victims in on his prostitute sister and grossly overweight wife.Bruno - Homosexual German (i think), often goes to southern states in the US to interview redneck types and often comes on to them to watch how offended they get.At times he does things that make me feel embarrased even watching the show.  He stood in front of a crowd at a baseball game as Borat and sang an improvised version of the Kazistan national anthem while everyone stood and tried to play along.  Or when he has round table discussions with a greatly diversified panel of experts in a field and he does something like accuse a very conservative type guy of not flushing his #2 back stage (and persistently goes back to asking him about it long after the guy is offended) and sometimes at the close of the discussion asks for a word that represents each person on their stand for the issue and goes on to try to make up a really horrible song using each persons word.Ali-G has absolutely no shame.

820659,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00020X852,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","I had a great political science professor as an undergraduate, Jim Ranchino, a student of William Appleman Williams.  Nothing angered Ranchino so much as lightly examined or passively accepted ideas.  His goal as a professor, he said, was to raise our ""B.S. quotient.""  To this end, he would try to make us challenge him.  On occasion he would do his best to make his students challenge him, to force us to refuse to accept him as an authority, even intentionally lying for the entire class period, making up increasingly outrageous ""facts"" about, say, the war in the Pacific in WW II or the beliefs of some political philosopher.  His goal was not to get us to ingest a certain body of ""facts,"" but to get us to question, to challenge, and confront.I think Jim Ranchino would have appreciated Sascha Baron Cohen's humor.  His three alter egos - Ali G., Borat, and Brno - are among the most challenging comic characters to have appeared in the past couple of decades.  They are challenging both because Cohen uses them to challenge and satirize our almost limitless gullibility.  Ali G. is a brilliant caricature of wannabes, people who are so fake that they themselves are unaware of it.  We don't know what Ali G.'s real name is, but we know that he is a white, upper-class twit.  He talks of ""Keeping it real,"" yet he is so self-deceived that he can confront his viewers by asking, ""Haven't you ever seen a black man before?""  So on one level we laugh at Ali G. because he is a self-deceived idiot, but on another we laugh at the people who are taken in by his fraud.  And since many of the people Ali G. deceives are people that we look up to in our culture, the joke is on us as well.  Cohen's strategy is perhaps best seen in a skit where Brno interviews a man in charge of a fashion show and asks him a string of questions that directly contradict one another, such as ""Why was everything so light?"" follows by ""Why was everything so heavy?""  His final question in the interview is, ""Is consistency important to you?""Of course, this constant puncturing of the pretensions of our culture would be merely an intellectual exercise if the series wasn't also hysterically funny.  There are times in DA ALI G. SHOW when I laugh about as hard as it is possible for me to laugh.  There are also times when I merely winch.  Cohen is almost always on the edge in his humor, which how he likes it.  Much of the time when I watch him, I'm extremely uncomfortable; the rest of the time I'm laughing my head off.  In one scene I might be dying as Ali G. asks Buzz Aldrin, ""Will man ever set foot on the sun?""  (After Aldrin assures him that we will not, ever, because it is too hot, Ali G. asks, ""What if we were to go during the winter?"")  In another I might feel uneasy compassion for some poor soul as Borat shows pornographic Polaroids of him and his sister.  Sometimes his skits show us at our worse, such as the glee with which patrons in a country western bar join Borat in singing ""Throw the Jew Down the Well.""  Are we, we wonder, really that racist beneath the surface?  Or are the people in the bar oblivious as to the meaning of the lyrics?Cohen has a longstanding interest in prejudice and hatred of otherness.  At Cambridge University his studies were centered on the American civil rights movement in the sixties (I've wondered if his frequent visits to Mississippi on his shows are related to his academic background).  I'm not saying that everything on Cohen's shows has an elevated purpose or is high-minded, but I do believe that it is part of the mix.  Obviously he is first and foremost an entertainer more than willing to take the low road for a laugh, but it is also obvious that his questions often have other purposes.",5,One of the most fascinating comedians of our age,1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,3736,"['had', 'great', 'political', 'science', 'professor', 'undergraduate', 'Jim', 'Ranchino', 'student', 'William', 'Appleman', 'Williams', 'Nothing', 'angered', 'Ranchino', 'so', 'much', 'lightly', 'examined', 'passively', 'accepted', 'ideas', 'goal', 'professor', 'said', 'was', 'raise', 'B.S', 'quotient', 'end', 'would', 'try', 'make', 'challenge', 'occasion', 'would', 'do', 'best', 'make', 'students', 'challenge', 'force', 'refuse', 'accept', 'authority', 'even', 'intentionally', 'lying', 'entire', 'class', 'period', 'making', 'up', 'increasingly', 'outrageous', 'facts', 'say', 'war', 'Pacific', 'WW', 'II', 'beliefs', 'political', 'philosopher', 'goal', 'was', 'not', 'get', 'ingest', 'certain', 'body', 'facts', 'get', 'question', 'challenge', 'confront.I', 'think', 'Jim', 'Ranchino', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'Sascha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'humor', 'three', 'alter', 'egos', 'Ali', 'G.', 'Borat', 'Brno', 'are', 'most', 'challenging', 'comic', 'characters', 'have', 'appeared', 'past', 'couple', 'decades', 'are', 'challenging', 'Cohen', 'challenge', 'satirize', 'almost', 'limitless', 'gullibility', 'Ali', 'G.', 'brilliant', 'caricature', 'wannabes', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'fake', 'are', 'unaware', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Ali', 'G.', 'real', 'name', 'know', 'white', 'upper-class', 'twit', 'Keeping', 'real', 'yet', 'so', 'self-deceived', 'can', 'confront', 'viewers', 'asking', 'Have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'seen', 'black', 'man', 'So', 'one', 'level', 'laugh', 'Ali', 'G.', 'self-deceived', 'idiot', 'laugh', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'taken', 'fraud', 'many', 'people', 'Ali', 'G.', 'deceives', 'are', 'people', 'look', 'up', 'culture', 'joke', 'as', 'well', 'Cohen', 'strategy', 'perhaps', 'best', 'seen', 'skit', 'where', 'Brno', 'man', 'charge', 'fashion', 'show', 'string', 'questions', 'directly', 'contradict', 'one', 'such', 'Why', 'was', 'everything', 'so', 'light', 'Why', 'was', 'everything', 'so', 'heavy', 'final', 'question', 'interview', 'consistency', 'important', 'course', 'constant', 'puncturing', 'pretensions', 'culture', 'would', 'be', 'merely', 'intellectual', 'exercise', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'also', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'are', 'times', 'DA', 'ALI', 'G.', 'SHOW', 'when', 'laugh', 'as', 'hard', 'possible', 'laugh', 'are', 'also', 'times', 'when', 'merely', 'winch', 'Cohen', 'almost', 'always', 'edge', 'humor', 'how', 'Much', 'time', 'when', 'watch', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'rest', 'time', ""'m"", 'laughing', 'head', 'off', 'one', 'scene', 'might', 'be', 'dying', 'Ali', 'G.', 'Buzz', 'Aldrin', 'Will', 'man', 'ever', 'set', 'foot', 'sun', 'Aldrin', 'will', 'not', 'ever', 'too', 'hot', 'Ali', 'G.', 'What', 'were', 'go', 'winter', 'might', 'feel', 'uneasy', 'compassion', 'poor', 'soul', 'Borat', 'pornographic', 'Polaroids', 'sister', 'Sometimes', 'skits', 'show', 'worse', 'such', 'glee', 'patrons', 'country', 'western', 'bar', 'join', 'Borat', 'singing', 'Throw', 'Jew', 'Down', 'Well', 'wonder', 'really', 'racist', 'surface', 'are', 'people', 'bar', 'oblivious', 'meaning', 'lyrics', 'Cohen', 'longstanding', 'interest', 'prejudice', 'hatred', 'otherness', 'Cambridge', 'University', 'studies', 'were', 'centered', 'American', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'sixties', ""'ve"", 'wondered', 'frequent', 'visits', 'Mississippi', 'shows', 'are', 'related', 'academic', 'background', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'everything', 'Cohen', 'shows', 'elevated', 'purpose', 'high-minded', 'do', 'believe', 'part', 'mix', 'Obviously', 'first', 'foremost', 'entertainer', 'more', 'willing', 'take', 'low', 'road', 'laugh', 'also', 'obvious', 'questions', 'often', 'have', 'other', 'purposes']",Da Ali G Show - The Complete First Season

820662,A19HCQSC5FVOXW,B00020X852,Scott McFarland,"[74, 76]","The jokes in Ali G. interviewing various American figures are really based on the humor in these people being so detached from youth culture that they think he is possibly serious (even when asking the most ridiculous questions) and possibly really does have a show that uses hip-hop jargon to explain politics and world events to da youth.  Correspondingly, most of his best interview segments happen with older people, or people from rural areas.The actor's particulaur genuis is his ability to keep a straight face after having asked the most totally ridiculous question, or said the most ridiculous and vulgar thing, possible.  No small acheievement.The humor in the Borat character, a Middle-Eastern man visiting and touring America for his program (beamed back to Khazakstan television) is based on the duality between Borat's polite, civilized manner and the brutal misogyny and racism that lies within his mindset and his culture, which he pleasantly verbalizes in his broken English.The humor in the Bruno character is rather simple.  He consistently and persistently chooses to believe that all men are homosexuals.

820663,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B00020X852,Sky,"[1, 1]","After seeing the first season of Da Ali G Show on sale here at Amazon for under 5 bucks, I immediately added it to my cart. This genius show really is worthy of purchase at its regular price, but I was just lucky enough to see the sale after the DVD appeared in a completely unrelated product search last week. The DVD arrived yesterday, my older son and I watched all 6 episodes in a single night, and we laughed out loud like it was the first time we ever saw the show. Well, actually it was the first time my son saw the show, and he got his first 3 hour lesson in Socratic Irony.The Ali G character is funny, and remember it is this series that also introduced theBoratandBr&uuml;nocharacters to the US as well. Sacha Baron Cohen takes his characters, puts them in interview mode with unassuming real people--often famous people--that believe they are actually participating in some kind of talk show. And the result is usually hilarity. The funniest part being the reaction to each character by the people that he is duping. Cohen's Ali G character (a stereotypical hip-hop, British ghetto banger TV host), Borat (a Kazakhstani reporter naive to US culture), and Br&uuml;no (a stereotypical gay mannerismed TV host) have the same modus operandi....And that modus operandi is Socratic Irony; Cohen's characters deliberately feign ignorance in order to expose weakness in the commitment that people have to being so politically correct that they almost always seriously (attempt to) answer the ridiculous opinions and questions that Cohen's characters come up with. Hence, his victims look equally stupid.The only victim that I ever saw that had enough intelligence to walk out of the situation without any regard to whether or not he was offending a Cohen character (Ali G) was Donald Trump.Even if you were a fan of this show almost 10 years ago now, trust me when I say that if the last time you saw the show (like me) was when it was on HBO, you will enjoy watching these episodes again today just as if it were the first time you were seeing them.If you've never seen this show: Check. It. Out. But don't be fooled into being offended by any of the Cohen characters. They are not real; the man behind the mask really isn't that stupid. He's trying to make YOU look stupid. And if you take Cohen's characters seriously, you will indeed look stupid. You see?

820664,A2K0Y55A5KQSU7,B00020X852,Sloopydrew,"[7, 8]","Sacha Baron Cohen is the comedic equivalent of a ""one-man band.""  He plays three distinctly different and equally memorable (and hilarious) characters.  There's the flamboyant and feminine fashion consultant (whose name I forget).  Borat, the reporter from Kazakhstan who, through his ""naivety,"" makes some of the most outrageous claims on TV and succeeds in shocking almost everyone he interviews.  And then there's Ali G.  He wants ""respeck,"" but has a hard time getting it, when he mispronounces his guest's names, official titles and job positions.  In season 1 Ali interviews well-known and well-respected people such as  Boutros-Boutros Ghali, Buzz Aldrin, Newt Gingrich, Donald Trump and James Lipton.  His questions run the gamut from inept to braindead, but they all get a laugh -- especially when his ""victims"" take him seriously and begin to get angered with him.  Watch Donald Trump get flustered when Ali G tries to sell him on his ice-cream glove.  Wait until you see him turn the tables by using his own version of the ""what's your favorite swear word"" question on James Lipton, himself.As far as the DVD, as with most HBO releases, there aren't as many extras as you would like, but there are more than HBO usually provides and what's here is hilarious.  I'd pay for the boxset for the 2 extra Borat segments, alone.  There is also a commentary track on one of the episodes featuring Sacha Baron Cohen and one of the show's writers and producers.  The most interesting extra is the movie used to pitch the Ali G movie ""Spyz.""  It's actually pretty hilarious and I'd like to know what nut was dump enough not to greenlight the feature film.This is an excellent collection that I'd recommend to anyone who likes to laugh.  If you've never watched it, think Punk'd or Candid Camera, with Andy Kaufman as the host.  Now take that thought and make it three times as funny as you're currently thinking and you'll get an idea of how great the show is.  As an added bonus, it can also be used as an exercise tape.  Watch it all back-to-back and you'll laugh hard enough to get in your aerobics for the day.
