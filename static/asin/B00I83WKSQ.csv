It's the same genre as the old ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""48 Hours"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movies - except with the updated humor and sophistication of the best of Schwarzenegger et al. Light, nonstop, hilarious, action-packed, irreverent, violent, fun. The banter is perfect between Glover and Trejo - and I hope ""the Dannys"" make a few sequels together. It would only work together. The chemistry is a crucial component of why this works. (Such as when Glover calls Trejo a ""damn Mexican MacGuyver"" after they make an escape.) Watch it expecting nothing more or less than popcorn-munching fun, and you'll enjoy it the way it's meant to be enjoyed.Note: brief topless nudity.

I've adored Mr. Glover for years and really enjoyed all of his performances in the &#34;Lethal Weapon&#34; movies and everywhere else I could find him. Although I have no idea how old Mr. Glover is, I know that Mr. Trejo is almost 70.  I would never have guessed it.  Although Mr. Trejo tried to look like an aging boxer, a glimpse at his massive back and shoulder muscles in his thong backed tank top at the beginning of the movie tells the truth(Thank you, producers and directors, for that scene!). He also sported an impressive beard which is about the only way possible to make him look old--was it natural or make up?  Mr. Glover has one of those adorable faces that you just can't resist and both of these wonderful gents are very lovable in this movie. I loved the scene where they dressed for their adventure in crime fighting and each has a closet full of identical sets of clothing. I also loved that they took public transportation--taxi's and buses.  I loved the scene with Lonnie love in the property department of the police station. I loved the scene in the college dorm where Mr. Glover impresses the cute college co-ed who is pretty much naked, and I always love that the Dannies ended up with the girls.
