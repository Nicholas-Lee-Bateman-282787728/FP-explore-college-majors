1669777,AOB5695UUUJ0,B00EZ227DW,"Anime Lover ""D""","[12, 12]","Ryoske is your typical teenaged boy, he has dreams and also the more than normal hormonally driven desires.  HIs mother works overseas and his father has died so he is on his own.  But on a rainy day he sees a pretty red head standing outside his house, he offers her shelter and to get warm, where she stabs him with a broken sword.  However this fiery redhead is more than she appears, she is a Grim Reaper and she is on the hunt for a powerful soul to help her in a mission to save both her world and the mortal realm and she takes our hapless prevert to be her contractor while on our side of the gate.  However when they are attacked by an unusual monster she learns that there is more to this young man than meets the eye, and maybe he can be the answer she is looking for.This is a cross of High School DXD and Sekerei.  Despite his nature, like in HSDXD, our hero does have a good side and is willing to not only help out, but also shows that he cares for not only Lirissa, but the other girls as well - to the point of taking hits on their behalf.  The show is still full of panty shots, chest flashes, bath scenes, and other things that an ecchi action comedy is full of, but it does have a good story, enjoyable characters, and that feeling that despite everything a little romance.  A good series to watch and one that also deserves a new season (becuase you know there will always be new bad guys to fight).",5,Another good Ecchi show,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,1420,"['Ryoske', 'typical', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'dreams', 'also', 'more', 'normal', 'hormonally', 'driven', 'desires', 'HIs', 'mother', 'overseas', 'father', 'died', 'own', 'rainy', 'day', 'pretty', 'red', 'head', 'standing', 'house', 'shelter', 'get', 'warm', 'where', 'stabs', 'broken', 'sword', 'However', 'fiery', 'redhead', 'more', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'hunt', 'powerful', 'soul', 'help', 'mission', 'save', 'world', 'mortal', 'realm', 'hapless', 'prevert', 'be', 'contractor', 'side', 'gate', 'However', 'when', 'are', 'attacked', 'unusual', 'monster', 'more', 'young', 'man', 'eye', 'maybe', 'can', 'be', 'answer', 'looking', 'for.This', 'cross', 'High', 'School', 'DXD', 'Sekerei', 'nature', 'HSDXD', 'hero', 'have', 'good', 'side', 'willing', 'not', 'only', 'help', 'out', 'also', 'not', 'only', 'Lirissa', 'other', 'girls', 'well', 'point', 'taking', 'hits', 'behalf', 'show', 'still', 'full', 'panty', 'shots', 'chest', 'flashes', 'bath', 'scenes', 'other', 'things', 'ecchi', 'action', 'comedy', 'full', 'have', 'good', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'feeling', 'everything', 'little', 'romance', 'good', 'series', 'watch', 'one', 'also', 'new', 'season', 'becuase', 'know', 'there', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'new', 'bad', 'guys', 'fight']",So I Can't Play H: Complete Collection

Those blots block out scenes that would be more interesting if we could see them. Other wise it's pretty boring and predictable.
