1273453,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B002K0UNYQ,"C. Hill ""CFH""","[0, 0]","""Last of the Living"" is an odd, very low budget, slow paced zombie flick. This is not in same league is Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, or almost any of the more serious zombie movies, but it does have a some truly funny bits, a fair amount of action, and is overall watchable if you don't expect too much.No plot spoilers from me: This movie centers on three guys who have somehow managed to outlast the worst of the zombie apocalypses and have taken up day to day living in relative luxury since they still have electricity, access to well stocked food and music\video stores, and even a car to get around in. All of that changes when they meet up with a girl, perhaps the last uninfected one on the planet, and she happens to be a scientist who can help find a cure.Purists will not like the inconsistencies in the zombies since some are the more traditional ""slow"" types and others are the harder to kill ""fast"" types, without any explanation in why that would be the case. There are other plot holes and devices that will distract if you let them, but for the most part they are forgivable.Since I tend to like ""B-movies"" anyway and will watch almost anything zombie related, my opinion might not match up to that of an objective observer.CFH",3,Watchable Not Too Serious Zombie Flick,1287532800,"10 20, 2010",2010,1246,"['Last', 'Living', 'odd', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'slow', 'paced', 'zombie', 'flick', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'Zombieland', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'almost', 'more', 'serious', 'zombie', 'movies', 'have', 'truly', 'funny', 'bits', 'fair', 'amount', 'action', 'overall', 'watchable', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much.No', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'movie', 'centers', 'three', 'guys', 'who', 'have', 'somehow', 'managed', 'outlast', 'worst', 'zombie', 'apocalypses', 'have', 'taken', 'up', 'day', 'day', 'living', 'relative', 'luxury', 'still', 'have', 'electricity', 'access', 'well', 'stocked', 'food', 'music\\video', 'stores', 'even', 'car', 'get', 'around', 'changes', 'when', 'meet', 'up', 'girl', 'perhaps', 'last', 'uninfected', 'one', 'planet', 'be', 'scientist', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'find', 'cure.Purists', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'inconsistencies', 'zombies', 'are', 'more', 'traditional', 'slow', 'types', 'others', 'are', 'harder', 'kill', 'fast', 'types', 'explanation', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'are', 'other', 'plot', 'holes', 'devices', 'will', 'distract', 'let', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'forgivable.Since', 'tend', 'like', 'B-movies', 'anyway', 'will', 'watch', 'almost', 'anything', 'zombie', 'related', 'opinion', 'might', 'not', 'match', 'up', 'objective', 'observer.CFH']",N/A

1273457,A2DQR20UWY2G0Y,B002K0UNYQ,"Dr. Metal ""e23adams""","[2, 3]","This is a nice little independent low budget Zombie film.  It was actually fimled in New Zealand, and that in itself is a bit extrodinary.  I hardly know any film from there.  What makes this movie better or at least different from most in the Zombie genre is the fact that it dosn't take it self so serious, as most Zombie movies almost inevitably do.  Actually, there is plenty of ""hidden"" humor in it, so that it creates a nice comical atmosphere to go right along with the ""seriousness"" of Zombies stalking the enviornment.The plot is good because it dosn't try to be anything extrodinary or pretentious, so there's no typical Hollywood blown out of porportions plot here, just something rather believable.  You have 3 guys that are all between late 20s early 30s that discover that they've survived a massive Zombie plague, and now are forced to live in a post apocalyptic world.  At first, this might sound pretty gloomy but they are not totally upset or even depressed about this, they simply figure that they'd make the best out of the predicament that they're in.  So they tend to look at the brighter side of things.  That includes that since in a post apocalyptic world they aren't required to work anymore, they simply stay at home, play video games, listen to music or venture outside to go ""shopping"".  They're shopping sprees are actually hilarious, since all the supermarkets are abandoned, they can go into any shop without paying anything and taking whatever they want.  I really liked the scene in which they go shopping for groceries, and afterwards when one of them insists to go into a CD/DVD store to look for a new album, one of the friends retorts ""do you actually believe that someone would go through the trouble of putting that album into this shop, even if the band managed to finish recording that album.""  The kicker is that the guy actually finds that new CD that he's been hoping to get at that store.  In this sense, they are in a strange way in a kind of shopping heaven or nirvana, where they can get anything that's in the stores for free, and whenever they get bored by the place that their living in they simply move to another mansion.  One of their favorite hobbies is wacking Zombies in their neighborhood.  Unlike most Zombie films, they don't resort to automatic weapons of any kind to do this, but have a down to earth mentality when it comes to eliminating them.  So their weapons are very street based: a baseball bat, a golf club, and what appear to be martial art sticks are used extensively by the 3 to rid their neighborhood of aggressive Zombies.When they actually do meet a young woman they decided to forget about their hobby and lifestyle of a while and join her to find a cure for their apocalypic world.  She seems to be a scientist whose father (who dies not much later) had been working on a cure that can transverse the Zombie effects on human and turn them back into normal people.  But she claims that they have to go to Scott Island because there the medical facilities are available that they would need to mass produce this cure, she also says that this place has not been infected by the Zombies.  From there on the 4 embark on a hell bent for leather mission to save the world, or at least New Zealand from the ominious Zombie plague.Anyways, I don't intent to give any too much of the rest of the story, but the movie is well done for a low budget film, and its rather enjoyable.  While its not 28 Days Later, which is obviously a much bigger budget film, it is still respectable for what it actually is - a nice humorous Zombie flick.This DVD is probably of most interest to Zombie film fans that don't mind humor as well.  Finally, I wanted to say that the acting was done well enough by those newcomers, and I hope that we'll see more of them in the future.",3,It tends to grow on you with time!,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,3828,"['nice', 'little', 'independent', 'low', 'budget', 'Zombie', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'fimled', 'New', 'Zealand', 'bit', 'extrodinary', 'hardly', 'know', 'film', 'there', 'What', 'movie', 'better', 'least', 'different', 'most', 'Zombie', 'genre', 'fact', ""n't"", 'take', 'so', 'serious', 'most', 'Zombie', 'movies', 'almost', 'inevitably', 'do', 'Actually', 'plenty', 'hidden', 'humor', 'nice', 'comical', 'atmosphere', 'go', 'right', 'along', 'seriousness', 'Zombies', 'stalking', 'enviornment.The', 'plot', 'good', 'dos', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'anything', 'extrodinary', 'pretentious', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'blown', 'porportions', 'plot', 'here', 'just', 'something', 'rather', 'believable', 'have', '3', 'guys', 'are', 'late', '20s', 'early', '30s', 'discover', ""'ve"", 'survived', 'massive', 'Zombie', 'plague', 'now', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'world', 'first', 'might', 'sound', 'pretty', 'gloomy', 'are', 'not', 'totally', 'upset', 'even', 'depressed', 'simply', 'figure', ""'d"", 'make', 'best', 'predicament', ""'re"", 'tend', 'look', 'brighter', 'side', 'things', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'world', 'are', ""n't"", 'required', 'work', 'anymore', 'simply', 'stay', 'home', 'play', 'video', 'games', 'listen', 'music', 'venture', 'go', 'shopping', ""'re"", 'shopping', 'sprees', 'are', 'actually', 'hilarious', 'supermarkets', 'are', 'abandoned', 'can', 'go', 'shop', 'paying', 'anything', 'taking', 'want', 'really', 'liked', 'scene', 'go', 'shopping', 'groceries', 'afterwards', 'when', 'one', 'go', 'CD/DVD', 'store', 'look', 'new', 'album', 'one', 'friends', 'do', 'actually', 'believe', 'someone', 'would', 'go', 'trouble', 'putting', 'album', 'shop', 'even', 'band', 'managed', 'finish', 'recording', 'album', 'kicker', 'guy', 'actually', 'new', 'CD', 'been', 'hoping', 'get', 'store', 'sense', 'are', 'strange', 'way', 'kind', 'shopping', 'heaven', 'nirvana', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'anything', 'stores', 'free', 'whenever', 'get', 'bored', 'place', 'living', 'simply', 'move', 'mansion', 'One', 'favorite', 'hobbies', 'wacking', 'Zombies', 'neighborhood', 'most', 'Zombie', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'resort', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'kind', 'do', 'have', 'down', 'earth', 'mentality', 'when', 'eliminating', 'weapons', 'are', 'very', 'street', 'based', 'baseball', 'bat', 'golf', 'club', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'martial', 'art', 'sticks', 'are', 'used', 'extensively', '3', 'rid', 'neighborhood', 'aggressive', 'Zombies.When', 'actually', 'do', 'meet', 'young', 'woman', 'decided', 'forget', 'hobby', 'lifestyle', 'while', 'join', 'find', 'cure', 'apocalypic', 'world', 'be', 'scientist', 'father', 'who', 'not', 'much', 'later', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'cure', 'can', 'transverse', 'Zombie', 'effects', 'human', 'turn', 'back', 'normal', 'people', 'have', 'go', 'Scott', 'Island', 'medical', 'facilities', 'are', 'available', 'would', 'need', 'mass', 'produce', 'cure', 'also', 'place', 'not', 'been', 'infected', 'Zombies', 'there', '4', 'embark', 'hell', 'bent', 'leather', 'mission', 'save', 'world', 'least', 'New', 'Zealand', 'ominious', 'Zombie', 'plague.Anyways', 'do', ""n't"", 'intent', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'rest', 'story', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'not', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'obviously', 'much', 'bigger', 'budget', 'film', 'still', 'respectable', 'what', 'actually', 'nice', 'humorous', 'Zombie', 'flick.This', 'DVD', 'probably', 'most', 'interest', 'Zombie', 'film', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'humor', 'well', 'Finally', 'wanted', 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'newcomers', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'future']",N/A

The cinematography seemed fluent, there was decent story and the actors were on it. The only thing about this film that could have been better was a stronger script. The tags on the cover, at least the one I bought suggested ""destined to become a cult classic"" by Terror 4 Fun & ""...a breakthrough zombie film that injects a high dose of hilarity"" by Revenant Magazine. I don't see this being a cult classic but at least a good watch for a hardcore zombie film fan. As for the ""Hilarity"", I had some smiles crack through most of it, close to the end the humor got a bit better, but not by much. I think this would have been a better film if it had been more serious a film, however having said that, the humor it had seemed more on a realistic level than most. What there was didn't seemed forced.At the offset of the film I thought it was going to be 28 Days later meets Shaun of the Dead, but that went away quickly, and happily so, as I would have been totally put of by the film if it were just rehash. I suggest viewing with little expectancy and you'll find it to be ok enough to own, but if one goes in expecting things that are reviewed on the cover, one may find themselves very disappointed.

1273473,AZXHK8IO25FL6,B002K0UNYQ,ribcage,"[31, 34]","Last of the Living isn't an outstanding film, but at least it's not terrible. With all the  independent zombie films out there you can trudge through a lot of them before finding anything  that's ""acceptable"" let alone outstanding, so it was nice that Last of the Living didn't just  outright suck. Unfortunately, since it wasn't outstanding, there's little reason for anyone outside  of die hard genre fans to pick it up and watch it, as is the case with most average zombie films.The story follows three friends who move from mansion to mansion kicking back playing video games,  watching movies, drinking beer, and occassionally venturing out into the wasteland for more supplies  or just to fight some zombies and boredom all in one go. The characters are acted out well enough (there are some slipups where lines were delivered so badly I felt removed from the film, but there  aren't too many of those), and there's tons of dry humor between them. I have to say that my sides  may have not been hurting, but I did laugh a few times and cracked a smile several other times. It's  rare for me to audibly laugh while watching a film alone, and Last of the Living pried some giggles  out of me so I'll definitely remember it for that.The story is minimal--like most zombie films our interest is set more on the characters surviving  than what actually goes on. I liked the characters well enough, so the typical zombie fare storyline  of survival and hope for a cure didn't bother me much. Plus, the plot didn't try any absurd  explanations for the outbreak or try to venture into new ground that the writers probably wouldn't  have been able to handle. There were a few moments that should have been emotional that weren't  really explored very deeply and passed by much more swiftly than they should have to carry any  weight, although if they had been explored deeply it probably would have turned out sour and cliche  so it's a lose/lose situation on those scenes.The zombies were certainly zombies, although the makeup on some seemed to be more cared for than on  others and this care seemed to come mostly at random. It wasn't especially distracting, I just wish  the style of some of the zombies earlier in the film carried on throughout. They looked very creepy,  disturbing and even mildly original to what I've seen in other films. Some of them looked downright  rushed, but this thing is indepenent after all, you've got to expect things like that.My real major disappointment with Last of the Living is that a couple of scenes are lifted directly  from 28 Days Later and at least one from Shaun of the Dead (I haven't seen the latter as recently so  I'm not sure if any others were as well). They stood out sorely against the rest of the film.Last of the Living does have enough that if you're a die hard zombie fan you'll probably get a kick  out of it.  The dry humor gives it enough spice to separate it from other average independent films  and the characters don't feel like stock characters. Although neither is enough to seperate it from  actually being ""average"" in general, it at least ranks head of its class.And obviously, if you haven't watched independent zombie films before this isn't the film for you,  and if you're looking to start watching independent zombie films it's also not the place for you to  start.",3,Acceptable,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,3340,"['Last', 'Living', ""n't"", 'outstanding', 'film', 'least', 'not', 'terrible', 'independent', 'zombie', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'can', 'trudge', 'lot', 'finding', 'anything', 'acceptable', 'let', 'alone', 'outstanding', 'was', 'nice', 'Last', 'Living', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'outright', 'suck', 'Unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'outstanding', 'little', 'reason', 'anyone', 'die', 'hard', 'genre', 'fans', 'pick', 'up', 'watch', 'case', 'most', 'average', 'zombie', 'films.The', 'story', 'three', 'friends', 'who', 'move', 'mansion', 'mansion', 'kicking', 'back', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'watching', 'movies', 'drinking', 'beer', 'occassionally', 'venturing', 'out', 'wasteland', 'more', 'supplies', 'just', 'fight', 'zombies', 'boredom', 'one', 'go', 'characters', 'are', 'acted', 'out', 'well', 'enough', 'are', 'slipups', 'where', 'lines', 'were', 'delivered', 'so', 'badly', 'felt', 'removed', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'tons', 'dry', 'humor', 'have', 'say', 'sides', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'hurting', 'did', 'few', 'times', 'cracked', 'smile', 'several', 'other', 'times', 'rare', 'audibly', 'watching', 'film', 'alone', 'Last', 'Living', 'pried', 'giggles', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'remember', 'that.The', 'story', 'minimal', 'most', 'zombie', 'films', 'interest', 'set', 'more', 'characters', 'surviving', 'what', 'actually', 'liked', 'characters', 'well', 'enough', 'typical', 'zombie', 'fare', 'storyline', 'survival', 'hope', 'cure', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'absurd', 'explanations', 'outbreak', 'try', 'venture', 'new', 'ground', 'writers', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'able', 'handle', 'were', 'few', 'moments', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'emotional', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'explored', 'very', 'deeply', 'passed', 'much', 'more', 'swiftly', 'should', 'have', 'carry', 'weight', 'had', 'been', 'explored', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'sour', 'cliche', 'lose/lose', 'situation', 'scenes.The', 'zombies', 'were', 'certainly', 'zombies', 'makeup', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'cared', 'others', 'care', 'seemed', 'come', 'mostly', 'random', 'was', ""n't"", 'especially', 'distracting', 'just', 'wish', 'style', 'zombies', 'earlier', 'film', 'carried', 'looked', 'very', 'creepy', 'disturbing', 'even', 'mildly', 'original', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'looked', 'downright', 'rushed', 'thing', 'indepenent', ""'ve"", 'got', 'expect', 'things', 'that.My', 'real', 'major', 'disappointment', 'Last', 'Living', 'couple', 'scenes', 'are', 'lifted', 'directly', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'least', 'one', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'latter', 'recently', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'others', 'were', 'as', 'well', 'stood', 'out', 'sorely', 'rest', 'film.Last', 'Living', 'have', 'enough', ""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'zombie', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'kick', 'dry', 'humor', 'enough', 'spice', 'separate', 'other', 'average', 'independent', 'films', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'stock', 'characters', 'enough', 'seperate', 'actually', 'being', 'average', 'general', 'least', 'ranks', 'head', 'class.And', 'obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'independent', 'zombie', 'films', ""n't"", 'film', ""'re"", 'looking', 'start', 'watching', 'independent', 'zombie', 'films', 'also', 'not', 'place', 'start']",N/A

If you are a film buff you may think of Sam Neil, Anna Paquin, or Peter Jackson who are all from New Zealand. Hell if you are thinking movies you will first probably think of Lord of the Rings if anything at all. Hell you might even be thinking of that comedy show ""Flight of the Concords"" whose two main characters are from New Zealand. Zombies though? Not a chance! At least not until now.This was written and directed by newcomer Logan McMillan on a shoestring budget. Apparently the majority of the film was shot for only $5,000 and they only received a budget for the special effects to do the rest after creating a trailer on You Tube. While it is visible in a few areas that the budget is nowhere near a typical Hollywood movie the plot and characters should keep you entertained enough to completely overlook it! While by no means the next cult classic to take the throne of Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland it's easily one that is worth picking up for your collection if you mix humor and horror. Let's face it though most horror fans find the horror movies themselves humorous so that's not really a stretch.The film starts after the apocalypse has happened and most of humanity is clearly already dead or turned into one of the walking dead. We get to start by following three friends (Morgan, Johnny, and Ash) who are moving from house to house and living the 'easy life' of being able to just sit back, relax, and have fun. They raid the mall and grocery stores for beer, food, and entertainment while, depending on the character, going out of their way to either avoid or kill the undead. While looking for a new house they decide to stop in a church as it could be both easily defended and a change of scenery. Easily defended is right as they stumble across a father and daughter who are both scientists trying to create a cure. While the father is bitten pretty shortly after this we see that Stef, the daughter, has an idea on how to create the cure once and for all and demands they help her get to the hospital where she can have access to the equipment she needs. Apparently there is a group of scientists in a safe zone it can be delivered to that will be able to use her cure to force back the zombie infection from the world! Yes, we have a case of the infected and not the undead.With a girl in the midst the guys are of course all smitten and from an ex actor, rocker, and geek only hilarity can ensue on how they react to both her and each other. Will this motley crew be able to work together to save the world and win the girl? Or will they try to sabotage one another to win her affection?

Yep, that's about as exciting as it gets. Much of the movie plays out like a music video, with interstitial dialogue. It does have its own heavily promoted theme song. I suppose that's a good thing.
