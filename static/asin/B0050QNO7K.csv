1435999,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,B0050QNO7K,CryWolf854,"[0, 0]","It seems like everywhere you look today, every network has a ghost hunting show.  Bio has My Ghost Story and Celebrity Ghost Stories; A&E; had Paranormal State; Discovery had the reigning king of ghostly horror with A Haunting; Travel has Ghost Adventures; and ScyFy has a plethora of Ghostbusters wannabes with Ghost Hunters, Paranormal Witness, Haunted Highways, and Ghost Lab.  It would only be a matter of time before NatGeo would jump on the ""I can feel a presence in this house"" bandwagon with the A Haunting spin-off The Haunted and I'm surprise to say that I loved this show.What makes The Haunted stand out over the rest of these types of shows is it's unique spin on how household pets become the first to sense a particular house's uninvited guests and their attempts to try and protect their Packs.  Unfortunately, in some stories presented here, their heroic efforts wind up costing some of them their lives.Presented here are the ten episodes as well as a few sub episodes of this amazingly heartfelt series which appears to have ended its short run of three seasons.  I normally hate it when studios divide their series seasons into only half season sets but having the first ten episodes is better than none at all.  Now all we have to do is wait for the rest of the sets to follow.  Hey, it took the WB nearly six years to finish releasing the last four seasons of its former hit drama Everwood.  It could still happen here.",5,"If No One Understands You, How Can You Warn Them?",1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,1441,"['everywhere', 'look', 'today', 'network', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'show', 'Bio', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'Celebrity', 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'A', 'E', 'had', 'Paranormal', 'State', 'Discovery', 'had', 'reigning', 'king', 'ghostly', 'horror', 'A', 'Haunting', 'Travel', 'Ghost', 'Adventures', 'ScyFy', 'plethora', 'Ghostbusters', 'wannabes', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'Paranormal', 'Witness', 'Haunted', 'Highways', 'Ghost', 'Lab', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'matter', 'time', 'NatGeo', 'would', 'jump', 'can', 'feel', 'presence', 'house', 'bandwagon', 'A', 'Haunting', 'spin-off', 'Haunted', ""'m"", 'surprise', 'say', 'loved', 'show.What', 'Haunted', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', 'types', 'shows', 'unique', 'spin', 'how', 'household', 'become', 'first', 'sense', 'particular', 'house', 'uninvited', 'guests', 'attempts', 'try', 'protect', 'Packs', 'Unfortunately', 'stories', 'presented', 'here', 'heroic', 'efforts', 'wind', 'up', 'costing', 'lives.Presented', 'here', 'are', 'ten', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'sub', 'episodes', 'amazingly', 'heartfelt', 'series', 'have', 'ended', 'short', 'run', 'three', 'seasons', 'normally', 'hate', 'when', 'studios', 'divide', 'series', 'seasons', 'only', 'half', 'season', 'sets', 'having', 'first', 'ten', 'episodes', 'better', 'none', 'Now', 'have', 'do', 'wait', 'rest', 'sets', 'follow', 'Hey', 'took', 'WB', 'nearly', 'six', 'years', 'finish', 'releasing', 'last', 'four', 'seasons', 'former', 'hit', 'drama', 'Everwood', 'could', 'still', 'happen', 'here']",The Haunted

Don't get me wrong it's nit going to win any Emmys, but it does deliver good interesting spooky stories relating to households that have animals, it's a mix of real footage of those involved docu style, and reenactments along with real footage when there is some.

1436002,A1W2OQ84YOQ9D6,B0050QNO7K,"Giles Shelton ""Net-Worm""","[5, 6]","If you enjoyed the Discovery show ""A Haunting"" before it got way to overly dramatic in the later seasons, then you will LOOOVE these DVDs!The two series are similar, with one major difference...The Discovery Channels ""A Haunting"" had the people who experienced the Paranormal Phenomena telling only around 50% of the story through-out the reenactment, while the producers of the show told the other 50% for them through overly dramatic scenes in which you never heard the people who went through these events talking, leading us viewers not to know what to believe, and not knowing what was overly dramatized for the sake of television.  This is where ""The Haunted"" takes over and blows ""A Haunting"" out the water!""The Haunted"" not only has the people who went through these experience tell 100% there story the entire time (as far as actually hearing them tell the story while showing reenactments while there story is being told), but they also include actual footage of ""never before seen on TV"" footage of what these people were seeing in there houses!  That's right, some of these episodes actually capture the demonic entities on video, leading to the creepiest scare you will ever encounter in a television show!There are also the animals which are affected by whats going on in these houses, and while the show seems to come across on the cover as mainly focusing on the animals, this is not the case, the main focus is on the people involved, with the animals being used as credible witnesses due to there behavior through out these experiences. I will say, the stories that are told of how much different these animals act when encountering these demonic entities really does put a real believability into the stories told, and in some cases these very healthy animals are actually found dead by there owners due to the stress that they are put under from these demonic entities.""The Haunted"" is everything ""A Haunting"" should have been... Very believable, not to overly dramatic, and with 100% of the stories being told by the people who lived through these events, not to mention some actual footage of the what these people lived through.  The reenactments are extremely well made, the quality of the program is top notch, and also very well produced!  I have not had shivers running through my body like this since I was maybe 6 years old in a dark room with no one around me, and I'm a 30 year old man now, it's truly that freaky.There are 10 episodes included on these 2 DVDs (with my Fav being the ""The Possession of Cassie"") with a running time of over 430 minutes (about 7 hours), you cannot beat that for the price!  I'm gonna bring these with me whenever we go camping or out to our resort house in the Country, these DVDs are something to watch with the family under the covers while eating some popcorn and sipping some hot chocolate during a thunderstorm!  As you can tell I just LOVE scaring the kids! Hehe  :)Get These DVDs, add to cart, you can thank me later! :)",5,"MUCH Better then Discovery's ""A HAUNTING""!!!
