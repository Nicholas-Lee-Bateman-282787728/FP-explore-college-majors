Then, it gets picked up. I think I saw good morals and a great story in EdTV, and the picture is obviously way better than the Truman Show. Matt McConaughey wasn't so bad, and somehow he didn't look perfect for the role. Woody Harrelson was the perfect cast of his brother. The rest were pretty good as well. In short, EdTV is worth watching.3/12: Let's set one thing straight: Matt McConaughey was and still is a very talented actor. EdTV is another excellent film on his resume, and he makes the comedy to work. The film is very funny that I've continue to see it from time to time. It has held up very well. Back then, when this was released, everybody was overpraising The Truman Show which was in fact a very overrated flick. EdTV is exactly right for that type of genre. To this day, I am surprised that nobody had tried to model after the concept conceived in EdTV and made it a reality on television. I thought that it seems very probable. Everybody involved in EdTV did a fantastic job and made it to work. It was really hilarious. My favorite is the catchy book title that the brother wrote and then later Bill Maher's questioning it. All in all, EdTV is the film to see...again and again. It does have a lot to say about the media and viewers' infatuation with people with no talent. I am raising the rating of EdTV from `7' to '9'.",5,"""A Joyous Celebration of Boobery.""",1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,1474,"['Viewed', '4/04', '7/05', '3/12Rate', '97/05', 'EdTV', 'funny', 'well-done', 'picture', 'Sometimes', 'movie', 'down', 'energy', 'Then', 'picked', 'up', 'think', 'saw', 'good', 'morals', 'great', 'story', 'EdTV', 'picture', 'obviously', 'way', 'better', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Matt', 'McConaughey', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'perfect', 'role', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'was', 'perfect', 'cast', 'brother', 'rest', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'short', 'EdTV', 'worth', 'watching.3/12', 'Let', 'set', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', 'Matt', 'McConaughey', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'EdTV', 'excellent', 'film', 'resume', 'comedy', 'work', 'film', 'very', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'continue', 'see', 'time', 'time', 'held', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'Back', 'then', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'everybody', 'was', 'overpraising', 'Truman', 'Show', 'was', 'fact', 'very', 'overrated', 'flick', 'EdTV', 'exactly', 'right', 'type', 'genre', 'day', 'am', 'surprised', 'nobody', 'had', 'tried', 'model', 'concept', 'conceived', 'EdTV', 'made', 'reality', 'television', 'thought', 'very', 'probable', 'Everybody', 'involved', 'EdTV', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'made', 'work', 'was', 'really', 'hilarious', 'favorite', 'catchy', 'book', 'title', 'brother', 'wrote', 'then', 'later', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'questioning', 'EdTV', 'film', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'have', 'lot', 'say', 'media', 'viewers', 'infatuation', 'people', 'talent', 'am', 'raising', 'rating', 'EdTV', '7', '9']",N/A

OK, they are both biting satires on the power of the media and our need for soap but I found EdTV actually (and  surprisingly) more emotionally engaging. This is real world, real problems,  reality. The lead actors provide great depth and helped me to really taste  the 'will he, wont he' challenges faced by Ed. The end has a nice touch  underlining the issues behind the 'who decides what is publicity and what  is an invasion of privacy' question. Anyway - a great movie and with all  these live web cams and TV shows about groups of people living together  under the camera, this is not as far fetched a premise as it may have once  been.

Fresh into his career as a leading man, Matthew McConaughey plays into his typecast as a drawling, charming bachelor, this time spiced with the angle of a 24/7 reality show that broadcasts his every waking moment. Naturally, this eventually plays havoc on his personal life, especially when he picks up with his brother's publicity-shy ex (Jenna Elfman). Not quite as interesting or original as 1998's thematic clone The Truman Show, it's still a fair (if light) take on the cult of celebrity with some good, unexpected curves peppering the plot. McConaughey is unbearable in a few scenes, but he's at least believable as the naive, overnight celebrity everyman adopted by pop culture.

506453,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00000JMOD,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 3]","If Andy Warhol were alive today, he might conceivably modify his famous ""In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes"" quote to something like, ""In the future, everyone will have his very own reality show""--which might require that one be in the limelight for a bit longer than 15 minutes actually...but would it be quality time?Ron Howard's EDtv was not a huge hit at the time of its release, and critically, it was your classic ""mixed"" reception.  And it suffered from coming so close on the heels of two other TV-themed films, THE TRUMAN SHOW AND PLEASANTVILLE.  But EDtv is a genial movie, starring a genial Matthew McConaughey, an even more genial Jenna Elfman, and an array of genuinely genial to genially grouchy supporting characters.  The casting is ingenious and almost ""stunt,"" in that many of the cast have had their fair share of brushes with the tabloids and could certainly offer a few insights of their own as regards the pro's and cons of celebrity culture.It's sly casting, but it's also good casting.  Ron Howard's famous abiltity with actors serves him well once again in this project--so much so that even the occasional lapses in plot can be overlooked.  That so many of the cast, including the director himself, are more known for the television work than for films lends this amiable satire an additional layer of irony.  And also a certain validity.  Julia Roberts would have been too much of a ""big screen"" star to take on Liz Hurley's role, for instance.  Hurley, a model and hair product spokesperson (not even a series vet!) is really just ""small screen"" enough for her part as ""a model and sometimes actress"" on the make.The notion of a 24 hour a day broadcast of one individual's life is perhaps less outlandish in 2006 as it was in 1998.  Back in those days, ""reality TV"" was limited mainly to an MTV that was trying to redefine itself and a few other, relatively minor cable stations.  The new millennium changed all that--although despite being inundated with so-called ""reality,"" no network has offered the unedited version (so far).And with good reason.  It really would be too boring.  EDtv (the movie) risks tedium itelf by clocking in at over two hours, which is a bit too long, by industry standards, for a comedy.  It probably could have stood some editing itself.Unlike the surreal TRUMAN SHOW, EDtv is based on the premise that people (regular guys and not just exhibitionists) might willingly permit their entire lives to be broadcast 24/7. Where would anybody get such an idea? The only way to sell the premise really is to have the cable network so desperate that they will try almost anything.  Ellen DeGeneres' Network exec character complains that they are losing ratings share to the Gardening Channel, complaining that people ""would rather watch soil.""  Not everyone at the network is convinced, however, and the show does get off to a shaky start.  It's only when the camera uncovers family scandal that things start hopping ratings-wise and otherwise, and before you can say ""EDtv"" a phenom is born.There's a certain irony in that particular plot twist that gives this media satire a bit of a leavening touch.  Ed (with camera crew in tow) drops by brother's place for a visit only to find that brother Ray (Woody Harrelson) is with a woman other than the girlfriend (Jenna Elfman) both the film audience and now the TV audience have come to know.  Of course, it's longsince been clear that Ed and Shari (Elfman's character) have had eyes for each other all along, so Ray's two-timing on TV is exactly the plot device that we've been waiting for all along.Shari has been a camera-shy bit player in this farce up until now.  Once she becomes Ray's ex- and Ed's current girlfriend, she finds the strain of 24 hour coverage of her personal life unbearable, and the relationship is almost nipped in the bud.  Of course, even if the (movie) believes that their getting together is virtually inevitable, however, it's nonetheless true that it was the TV show that brought this pair together, and, one could argue, did so in such a dramatic way that the love that hits them could only be full force.So when it all gets to be a bit much, and Shari breaks it off and runs, she can be said to be biting the hand that joined her and Ed together.That little irony is certainly not enough to compel any sane person to want to remain in this intrusive set-up, and her frustration soon becomes Ed's.  His subsequent plotting to get out of his contract is understandable and even laudable in that light.  It does all go to prove, however, that life in contemporary, ""mediated"" America ain't simple.  As insane as it can get and as overwhelmng as it can be, it even has its upside.  Not the least of the benefits is Ed's the mega-salary (with its ""balloon payments"") that he still gets to keep, even after he officially reneges on the deal.  The audience can't begrudge him that, norhis newfound happiness with Shari (about whom most Americans polled for USA TODAY had their doubts at first).  That's all part of the American dream too.  If you can hoodwink the powers that be, more power to you.Speaking of Andy Warhol.  I recall that back in the 60s, I used to be intrigued by the notion of a 24 hour movie of the Empire State Building or eight hours of someone sleeping.  I didn't want to actually WATCH them necessarily, but I was intrigued by the fact that they existed.  I don't imagine I would feel much differently about an actual EDtv (or a BOBtv, a MIKEtv or a SUSIEtv).

Never one to go searching for the public's attention. That is until well-known television station True-TV has a slide in the ratings and need something new to keep their network Number 1.Their solution is to broadcast one persons day to day life LIVE. Ed's brother Ray decides to audition, but the network like Ed better. At first Ed thinks maybe he shouldn't get involved in such public scrutiny, until his brother talks him into it.After a slow, embarassing start to live television, Ed soon begins to enjoy the fame. He gets everything he ever wanted. Until his family and friends begin to regret their time in the spotlight, after some uncomfortable truths are learnt. Suddenly, Ed must decide which is more important, instant fame or a right to one's privacy?Acclaimed director Ron Howard (Ransom, Apollo 13) explores the realities of instant fame, and all of the repercussions. A perfect choice of topic considering he has been in the public eye his entire life.I love this movie. It is very funny, very truthful, and worth more then one viewing. It brings up some interesting issues, and has some clever story points. A one point I'm sure I knew every line in this movie! It's pretty sad, but it means the lines are pretty easy to learn.If you thought you'd seen it all before in 'The Truman Show', think again! This movie is much funnier. A much better movie in all respects. Never boring. No offense to Truman fans. I've seen both.The cast may not appeal to everyone, but they are all wonderful in their roles. The ending may also not appeal to others. I didn't like it to begin with, but I have since changed my mind.This movie is great. The Collector's Edition makes it even better! With commentary, I find Ron always very easy to listen to. All extra features outtakes, deleated scenes and more are wonderful.

506460,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00000JMOD,Matthew Horner,"[2, 4]","EDtv is an amusing satire about America's obsession for ""reality-based"" television. It was produced and directed by Ron Howard. Mr. Howard was a television star as a boy on The Andy Griffin Show and went on to be a major talent behind the camera. His body of work includes Cocoon, Parenthood and Apollo 13. He is a cofounder of Imagine Entertainment, a movie and television production company. So the subject of Edtv is very familiar to him.Cynthia [Ellen DeGeneres] is an ambitious producer who sells her boss, Whitaker [Rob Reiner], on the idea of a show which follows a ""regular"" guy 24 hours a day. Brothers Ed and Ray [Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson] audition for the part, and Ed wins it. The show has low ratings until Ed falls for Ray's girlfriend, Sherri [Jenna Elfman]. Fireworks erupt, and the series soon becomes the most watched show in the country.Having your life on public display is full of complications, as well as ethical concerns. Howard treats the movie as a heartwarming comedy. He centers on the complications Ed and his family encounter, while giving only passing attention to the ethics of the situation. This is a wise decision, based, I think, on the idea that preaching and entertainment make poor bedfellows, especially when most of the actors are either present or past TV stars.Comparison of Edtv to The Truman Show is inevitable. It's a case of two movies having similar and ingenious, but limiting, themes. The Truman Show, which I personally enjoyed more, got to theaters much sooner. Had Edtv been the first to arrive, its critical and commercial success perhaps would have been much greater.The Truman Show was basically an allegory. Truman was adopted as an infant by a network and was raised unknowingly in the world's largest stage set. This is a plot foundation set in fantasy. It allowed the makers to insert all sorts of observations about modern morality, without offending the audience. EDtv simply takes reality TV to the next logical step. In doing so, it creates many funny situations, but it finally becomes unreal. We are reminded several times that we common folks are not as dumb as people who run TV networks think we are. Yet Ed lets his life be put on display without once thinking about the consequences. His brother, Ray, is lovable, but he's as dim as they come. The show's fans are all stereotypes. The men react like we are trained to expect them to, as do the women. This is not to say that EDtv is not entertaining. It is. But, beyond the original premise, it does little more than recycle tried and true jokes and situations.",3,Lesser Ron Howard effort,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,2597,"['EDtv', 'amusing', 'satire', 'America', 'obsession', 'reality-based', 'television', 'was', 'produced', 'directed', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Mr.', 'Howard', 'was', 'television', 'star', 'boy', 'Andy', 'Griffin', 'Show', 'went', 'be', 'major', 'talent', 'camera', 'body', 'work', 'Cocoon', 'Parenthood', 'Apollo', '13', 'cofounder', 'Imagine', 'Entertainment', 'movie', 'television', 'production', 'company', 'subject', 'Edtv', 'very', 'familiar', 'him.Cynthia', '[', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', ']', 'ambitious', 'producer', 'who', 'boss', 'Whitaker', '[', 'Rob', 'Reiner', ']', 'idea', 'show', 'regular', 'guy', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'Brothers', 'Ed', 'Ray', '[', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', ']', 'audition', 'part', 'Ed', 'show', 'low', 'ratings', 'Ed', 'Ray', 'girlfriend', 'Sherri', '[', 'Jenna', 'Elfman', ']', 'Fireworks', 'erupt', 'series', 'soon', 'most', 'watched', 'show', 'country.Having', 'life', 'public', 'display', 'full', 'complications', 'as', 'well', 'ethical', 'concerns', 'Howard', 'movie', 'heartwarming', 'comedy', 'complications', 'Ed', 'family', 'encounter', 'giving', 'only', 'passing', 'attention', 'ethics', 'situation', 'wise', 'decision', 'based', 'think', 'idea', 'preaching', 'entertainment', 'make', 'poor', 'bedfellows', 'especially', 'when', 'most', 'actors', 'are', 'present', 'past', 'TV', 'stars.Comparison', 'Edtv', 'Truman', 'Show', 'inevitable', 'case', 'two', 'movies', 'having', 'similar', 'ingenious', 'limiting', 'themes', 'Truman', 'Show', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'got', 'theaters', 'much', 'sooner', 'Had', 'Edtv', 'been', 'first', 'arrive', 'critical', 'commercial', 'success', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'greater.The', 'Truman', 'Show', 'was', 'basically', 'allegory', 'Truman', 'was', 'adopted', 'infant', 'network', 'was', 'raised', 'unknowingly', 'world', 'largest', 'stage', 'set', 'plot', 'foundation', 'set', 'fantasy', 'allowed', 'makers', 'insert', 'sorts', 'observations', 'modern', 'morality', 'offending', 'audience', 'EDtv', 'simply', 'reality', 'TV', 'next', 'logical', 'step', 'doing', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'situations', 'finally', 'unreal', 'are', 'reminded', 'several', 'times', 'common', 'folks', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'dumb', 'people', 'who', 'run', 'TV', 'networks', 'think', 'are', 'Ed', 'life', 'be', 'put', 'display', 'once', 'thinking', 'consequences', 'brother', 'Ray', 'lovable', 'as', 'dim', 'come', 'show', 'fans', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'men', 'react', 'are', 'trained', 'expect', 'do', 'women', 'not', 'say', 'EDtv', 'not', 'entertaining', 'original', 'premise', 'little', 'more', 'recycle', 'tried', 'true', 'jokes', 'situations']",N/A

We now have so many ""reality"" shows that the stuff going on in this flick pales in comparison.  What makes Ron Howard's film worthwhile is the way it shows how ""real life"" goes to ""reel life"" in a matter of days, as Ed's life is ""programmed"" to bring in higher ratings.  Initially doomed for failure, Ed's life becomes the fodder for everyman's desire to see someone ""little"" make it big.  Millions of fans become obsessed with Ed's life, and of course his mixed up family and romantic life even makes the ratings soar.  There are some wonderful little gimmicks Howard uses to show how the series that is doomed to fail becomes such a megahit.  In the beginning, the advertisers names flashed across the bottom are local businesses; once EDtv catches on, major companies are flashed instead.  Ed's choices in life lead the fans to follow suit:  notice how the pizza parlor's business booms after Ed says it's the best pizza in San Francisco (this is in the deleted scenes only).  Although the EDtv started out as wanting to capture the real moments in Ed's life, by the time two or three months have passed, Ed's life is no more real than those on ""Survivor"" or ""Big Brother.""  Let's face it:  how can one go about their normal life with microphones and cameras catching everything.Howard succeeds, however, in making much of the movie seem real; there are times when the characters act as if there wasn't anyone around at all.  But, notice how Elizabeth Hurley's character inhales the cameras and all her moves are calculated to look good on film.  Note the cruelty, too, of the fans who decide that Sherry (Ed's love) is too plain and not good enough for him, but how they love it when he starts making out with Jill.  This fades quickly though once Ed falls off the table and smooshes Jill's cat.EDtv doesn't always work; it's a little too long, and if you watch the deleted scenes, you'll be amazed at how much they cut out.The cast is uniformly excellent.  Matthew McConaughey as Ed possesses the kind of charismatic charm that would enslave a wide variety of people; Jenna Elfman's cuteness serves the character of Sherry well; Woody Harrelson brings a smarmy but comic force to the role of Ed's opportunistic brother; Ellen DeGeneres is superb as Cynthia, the woman behind the series; Rob Reiner is good as the arrogant and self-centered producer; Martin Landau and Sally Kirkland as Ed's stepfather and real mother are likewise excellent.  I wasn't overly impressed with Hurley or Dennis Hopper as Ed's real dad, but their characters were the most under-developed in the whole film.All in all, EDtv gives us the warning that exposition of one's real life isn't all it is cracked out to be.",4,REEL LIFE,1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,2761,"['EDtv', 'not', 'as', 'farfetched', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'when', 'released', 'now', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'reality', 'stuff', 'going', 'flick', 'comparison', 'What', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'way', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'reel', 'life', 'matter', 'days', 'Ed', 'life', 'programmed', 'bring', 'higher', 'ratings', 'Initially', 'doomed', 'failure', 'Ed', 'life', 'fodder', 'everyman', 'desire', 'see', 'someone', 'little', 'make', 'big', 'Millions', 'fans', 'become', 'obsessed', 'Ed', 'life', 'course', 'mixed', 'up', 'family', 'romantic', 'life', 'even', 'ratings', 'soar', 'are', 'wonderful', 'little', 'gimmicks', 'Howard', 'show', 'how', 'series', 'doomed', 'fail', 'becomes', 'such', 'megahit', 'beginning', 'advertisers', 'names', 'flashed', 'bottom', 'are', 'local', 'businesses', 'once', 'EDtv', 'catches', 'major', 'companies', 'are', 'flashed', 'instead', 'Ed', 'choices', 'life', 'lead', 'fans', 'follow', 'suit', 'notice', 'how', 'pizza', 'parlor', 'business', 'booms', 'Ed', 'best', 'pizza', 'San', 'Francisco', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'only', 'EDtv', 'started', 'out', 'wanting', 'capture', 'real', 'moments', 'Ed', 'life', 'time', 'two', 'three', 'months', 'have', 'passed', 'Ed', 'life', 'more', 'real', 'Survivor', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Let', 'face', 'how', 'can', 'one', 'go', 'normal', 'life', 'microphones', 'cameras', 'catching', 'everything.Howard', 'however', 'making', 'much', 'movie', 'seem', 'real', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'characters', 'act', 'was', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'around', 'notice', 'how', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'character', 'cameras', 'moves', 'are', 'calculated', 'look', 'good', 'film', 'Note', 'cruelty', 'too', 'fans', 'who', 'decide', 'Sherry', 'Ed', 'love', 'too', 'plain', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'how', 'love', 'when', 'making', 'out', 'Jill', 'fades', 'quickly', 'once', 'Ed', 'table', 'smooshes', 'Jill', 'cat.EDtv', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'cut', 'out.The', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Ed', 'kind', 'charismatic', 'charm', 'would', 'enslave', 'wide', 'variety', 'people', 'Jenna', 'Elfman', 'cuteness', 'character', 'Sherry', 'well', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'smarmy', 'comic', 'force', 'role', 'Ed', 'opportunistic', 'brother', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'superb', 'Cynthia', 'woman', 'series', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'good', 'arrogant', 'self-centered', 'producer', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Sally', 'Kirkland', 'Ed', 'stepfather', 'real', 'mother', 'are', 'likewise', 'excellent', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'impressed', 'Hurley', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Ed', 'real', 'dad', 'characters', 'were', 'most', 'under-developed', 'whole', 'film.All', 'EDtv', 'warning', 'exposition', 'one', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'cracked', 'out', 'be']",N/A

Ron Howard has struck at the heart of every person in America: deep down we all seek fame and celebrity, but this story serves as a morality tale: Celebrity for Celebrity's Sake ain't all that it's trumped up to be. There's a down side to Fame.Everyman Ed is selected for a True TV reality show, in which his supposedly mundane and average life is filmed, 24 hours a day. Only it doesn't turn out that way, as family secrets are revealed to the world, and Ed's life takes unexpected twists and turns. Somehow, celebrity isn't all sweet anymore, and Ed loses the people he loves because of his sudden fame, while attracting the sychophants and hangers-on who want to use him to thrust themselves in the spotlight. The Ed Phenomenon gets out of hand, with TV Execs attempting to hold Ed to an iron-clad contract and essentially committing him to EDTV for the rest of his life.It is a fast-paced, hilarious film with never a dull moment. Jenna Elfman does a good job with Ed's tortured girlfriend. Woody Harrelson is quite a scene stealer as Ed's sleazy older brother. Ron Howard's brother has a hilarious role as a frazzled, hairplugged cameraman, and Rob Reiner is a scream as the greedy President of True TV.  Matt McConaughey's performance as the hapless Ed is the calm in the Eye of the EDTV storm. And Ellen DeGeneres gives a surprisingly great performance as the one TV producer who sees the human behind this madness and does her part to help Ed get his life back and off the TV. An thoroughly enjoyable film that makes you think twice about pursuing celebrity.",5,Strikes at Society's Secret Obsession for Fame and Celebrity,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,1640,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'probably', 'close', 'hundred', 'times', 'good', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'struck', 'heart', 'person', 'America', 'deep', 'seek', 'fame', 'celebrity', 'story', 'morality', 'tale', 'Celebrity', 'Celebrity', 'Sake', 'ai', ""n't"", 'trumped', 'up', 'be', 'down', 'side', 'Fame.Everyman', 'Ed', 'selected', 'True', 'TV', 'reality', 'show', 'supposedly', 'mundane', 'average', 'life', 'filmed', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'Only', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'family', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'world', 'Ed', 'life', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'Somehow', 'celebrity', ""n't"", 'sweet', 'anymore', 'Ed', 'people', 'sudden', 'fame', 'attracting', 'sychophants', 'hangers-on', 'who', 'want', 'use', 'thrust', 'spotlight', 'Ed', 'Phenomenon', 'hand', 'TV', 'Execs', 'attempting', 'hold', 'Ed', 'iron-clad', 'contract', 'essentially', 'committing', 'EDTV', 'rest', 'life.It', 'fast-paced', 'hilarious', 'film', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'Jenna', 'Elfman', 'good', 'job', 'Ed', 'tortured', 'girlfriend', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'quite', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Ed', 'sleazy', 'older', 'brother', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'brother', 'hilarious', 'role', 'frazzled', 'hairplugged', 'cameraman', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'scream', 'greedy', 'President', 'True', 'TV', 'Matt', 'McConaughey', 'performance', 'hapless', 'Ed', 'calm', 'Eye', 'EDTV', 'storm', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'performance', 'one', 'TV', 'producer', 'who', 'human', 'madness', 'part', 'help', 'Ed', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'TV', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'think', 'twice', 'pursuing', 'celebrity']",N/A

And the building blocks were  all there to make this a better movie, as the excised scenes available on  DVD clearly indicate.  EDtv could have had something that it truky needed -  an edge.  An entire sub-sub-plot about a copycat TV program was taken out,  and I think the finished film was poorer for it.  People would have left  the theatre talking about the film instead of wondering where they paarked  the car.However, the film is not without its charms.  The cast is up tot  he task, the casting of media-plagued celebrities is inspired but not  intrusive, and the overall effect is not unplesaant.  This is only a two  star movie, though.Still, I give the DVD version an extra star because  of the extras.  The outtakes are funny once, the Making of Featurette is of  passable interest, but no other DVD in my experience has been as rich and  unstinting in deleted scenes.
