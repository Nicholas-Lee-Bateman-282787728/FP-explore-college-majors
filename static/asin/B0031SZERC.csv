This excellent program explores some of the major advances in evolutionary theory since then. Our modern theory of evolution is much deeper and more complex than Darwin's original theory. &#34;What Darwin Never Knew&#34; examines new aspects of our understanding, as well as looking at the large amount of evidence we have available that didn't exist in 1859.One of those nature vids that every person should see.",5,Outstanding,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,503,"['Darwin', 'published', 'Origin', 'Species', 'more', '150', 'years', 'ago', 'science', 'never', 'still', 'excellent', 'program', 'major', 'advances', 'evolutionary', 'theory', 'then', 'modern', 'theory', 'evolution', 'much', 'deeper', 'more', 'complex', 'Darwin', 'original', 'theory', '34', 'What', 'Darwin', 'Never', 'Knew', '34', 'examines', 'new', 'aspects', 'understanding', 'as', 'well', 'looking', 'large', 'amount', 'evidence', 'have', 'available', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', '1859.One', 'nature', 'vids', 'person', 'should', 'see']",N/A

The second half shows more details, latest research, including the quest to excavate the transitional specie (from water to land), and they found it, whoo hoo!, near the Arctic.  Also to show that Darwin was right about his theories and that today's research help to substantiate it.  Also a look into gene expression, turning certain parts of DNA on or off.  My favorite scene is when they show how a mutation in the gorilla causing Lou Gering's muscular dystrophy resulting in a weakening of our jaw muscles may have caused a slower fusion of growth plates in our skull.  Recently released '09, quality is definitely up to par as today's standards of NOVA PBS science.  Amazing graphics, color details of animals, 1080p, 16:9 widescr, etc.  Total: 2 hrs.  Highly recommended.  Thank you PBS.",5,"By golly, Galileo was right all this time, says Neil Armstrong dropping a hammer and a feather.

Proof of that would be the real stunner...Who? What? When? Why?I had a heart attack a year ago. Time for me is precious. I do NOT waste it now.
