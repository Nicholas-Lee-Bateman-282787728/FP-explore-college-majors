1358874,AESR2QQY553Q5,B003QAHJYG,Bo Knows,"[2, 2]","Joe E. Brown is at his best in this comedy baseball story filmed in the 1930's.  The film got lukewarm reviews in the day and it is a B level Warner film.  However, Brown was a big baseball fan and his athletic skills play extremely well here. The good natured humor holds up very well in the 21st century.  The chief character is full of endless excuses and Brown plays it to the hilt.  There are plenty of sight gags including one of the most hilarious pitching styles ever committed to film.  Credit Brown for creating several small bits of business that add charm to his character.  It really is his show, with support from William Frawley and Olivia De Havilland.The picture quality is good considering the age of the film.",4,Joe E.

With his goofy looks dominated by a wide mouth and narrow eyes, Brown usually played a gauche hero is some sort of scrape who beats the odds and wins the heart of a pretty ingenue leading lady. In this way, his films are not unlike those of the English George Formby, who was even goofier looking but had a significant advantage because his films always had delightful musical numbers and much better production values.""Alibi Ike"" is one of Brown's better known comedies set around a baseball star who has an excuse for every action. The comedy is predictable, genial but hardly rib-tickling! The film has a good supporting cast, mainly wasted, including Ruth Donnelly and a teenage Olivia De Havilland at the start of her illustrious career. The production values are very ordinary for this is really a B grade entry. If you have an interest in baseball, that helps.The film has been issued in the Warner's Archive collection which means it is very expensive, unrestored and contains no extras. In this case, the original theatrical trailer is included and the print is good.",2,Genial but B grade comedy romance,1295395200,"01 19, 2011",2011,1170,"['Joe', 'E.', 'Brown', 'was', 'Warner', 'Brother', 'house', 'comic', 'standard', '7', 'year', 'contract', '1936', 'goofy', 'looks', 'dominated', 'wide', 'mouth', 'narrow', 'eyes', 'Brown', 'usually', 'played', 'gauche', 'hero', 'sort', 'scrape', 'who', 'odds', 'heart', 'pretty', 'ingenue', 'leading', 'lady', 'way', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'English', 'George', 'Formby', 'who', 'was', 'even', 'goofier', 'looking', 'had', 'significant', 'advantage', 'films', 'always', 'had', 'delightful', 'musical', 'numbers', 'much', 'better', 'production', 'values', 'Alibi', 'Ike', 'one', 'Brown', 'better', 'known', 'comedies', 'set', 'baseball', 'star', 'who', 'excuse', 'action', 'comedy', 'predictable', 'genial', 'hardly', 'rib-tickling', 'film', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'mainly', 'wasted', 'including', 'Ruth', 'Donnelly', 'teenage', 'Olivia', 'De', 'Havilland', 'start', 'illustrious', 'career', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'ordinary', 'really', 'B', 'grade', 'entry', 'have', 'interest', 'baseball', 'helps.The', 'film', 'been', 'issued', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'collection', 'very', 'expensive', 'unrestored', 'extras', 'case', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'included', 'print', 'good']",Alibi Ike
1358876,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B003QAHJYG,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[0, 0]","Comedian Joe E. Brown--who had a personal love for baseball--plays Frank X. Farrell, a rookie for the Cubs with one of the kookiest pitching styles I've ever seen. But Farrell's penchant for excuses & pure malarkey get him in & out of trouble, personally & professionally, thus earning him the moniker ""Alibi Ike"". Farrell gets mixed up with gamblers who make him ""fix"" the games. Caught in one of his alibis to his sweetheart (a glowing Olivia DeHavilland just before movie stardom), it sometimes affects his game, with him pitching cockeyed, much to the frustration of his manager (an early William Frawley, long before ""I Love Lucy"").Brown is at his most genial best as Farrell, who seems to play the game on his own rules. The big climax where Farrell arrives just in time to save the day (in this case, night) shows off Brown's athletic ability as he darts around the bases & tumbles over the guy holding the ball to come into home base safe.Definitely one of Brown's best vehicles!",5,"Joe E.
