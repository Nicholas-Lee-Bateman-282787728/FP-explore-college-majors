I don't know,...there's just something about it that makes everything seem more ""real"".  On top of that, the acting is usually FAR superior to that of a scripted ""standard"" style film.  Why that is, I have no idea, but 99% of the time, that's how it works out.I checked out the trailer and to be perfectly honest, didn't even realize what was wrong with the guy?  I assumed it would be another ""Contracted"" type problem (another movie that I really enjoyed - check out my review on that one a as well).  I was REALLY surprised at the fact that the guy turned out to be a vampire.  Now, I wasn't going to ruin this for anyone that was like me and just flat out didn't realize it, but the fact that so many people posted it in their review titles, I figured the cat was out of the bag anyways.  Also, I feel I need to point out that I absolutely HATE 99% of vampire movies.  They are super cheesy and just bad (for the most part).  This movie, however, falls in the other 1%.  I thought it was brilliant!  Both the acting from Clif Prowse and Derek Lee was spot on!  I really believed that they could be taking this trip and documenting it.So the story goes.....Clif and Derek have been friends for ages and after Derek learns of a rare condition in his brain, he decides to drop everything and take a year long journey around the world.  Along with Clif (who happens to be a documentary film maker), the 2 embark on their year long voyage beginning in Paris where they meet up with their friends band to catch a show.  During the night, Derek ends up talking to Audrey (Baya Rehaz) and leaving with her.  Back at the hotel, the guys all gear up to bust in on the 2 lovebirds only to discover Derek alone and bloody.  The rest needs to be seen.I was honestly surprised at how the film turned out in the end.  I think they could continue Derek's journey through another movie or two.  Even continuing to document it.  It would have to be better than the last few seasons of Dexter!Make sure you continue to watch AFTER the end, as another surprise is waiting.  I thought that scene was absolutely BRILLIANT!Final Verdict:  DEFINITE WATCH!If this review has helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""yes"" button below.

Afflicted is pretty much a full-length movie of this idea.Two American backpackers agree to go globetrotting and broadcast their adventures through a web based series entitled ""Ends of the Earth."" Derek Lee plays himself, and is suffering from AVM, an abnormal connection between arteries and veins in the brain that can cause death at any moment. Clif Prowse, also starring as himself, keeps Derek company and aims to document everything they encounter with his sophisticated A/V equipment.Derek attempts to bang a girl he picks up at the club, but wakes up with a large gash above his left eyebrow and a giant chunk of flesh ripped out of his left arm.  The last thing he remembers is the girl, Audrey, attacking him and knocking him cold. This is where Derek's problems begin.Afflicted is your by-the-numbers vampire movie. The following rules are intact: no sunlight, the need to feed on human blood to survive, possessing superman strength, levitation, and they can't die by normal means. What sets Afflicted apart is its clever use of found footage to relay the various stages of the disease, starting with the initial bite. Everything is documented as it happens. Derek shows off his new found abilities like he is a superhero. Clif's fear starts to outweigh his urge to videotape Derek's ""skills.""The movie overall however, lacks a punch.

This is the starting point for Afflicted, the latest in a long, long line of micro-budget &#34;found-footage&#34; genre entertainments.  The macabre twist comes when one of the two flirts with a sexy Parisian at a nightclub and returns with her to his hotel room, where he is later found bloodied, bruised, and unconscious.  Confused and in pain upon rousing, he soon discovers he is faster and stronger than before, but also sensitive to sunlight and disgusted by food and wine.  Due to the demands of the format, the cameras continue to roll as he undergoes further transformations and investigates the mysterious ailment.  Many people have grown tired of films shot and edited this way, frustrated by the way they replace formal elegance with whiplash-inducing hand-held compositions and abrupt cuts, but this is at least a playful and well-crafted variation, in part because it is a first-person vampire origin story rather than a conventional haunted-house romp, a la Paranormal Activity.  While never particularly frightening, the storyline is cogent and involving on a dramatic level, and there are a handful of set pieces which prove almost awe-inspiring in their scope and spectacle considering the modesty of the overall production.

Most of the film is seen from a bird's eye POV, not the video recorder's POV. The production values are very good. It doesn't have a low budget feel to it at all. I saw a few of the lo/micro budget types of movies over the weekend, so this one definitely stood out as not one of them. The story is about a guy who has a brain condition that could burst at any time, killing him. So he and 2 friends go overseas on a 1 year world tour that they are uploading to a liveblog for friends and family. The critical moment, when he becomes afflicted, occurs early on so there's no drag. The pacing is good throughout. There is a little tension and suspense (for me) but I'd say the bulk of the enjoyment value came from being mentally engaged in the plot, wondering how things were going to play out. I was hooked into the story. The acting was fine. The protagonist does not accept his status and there are some cool scenes when he loses it and succumbs to his thirst. The character's internal conflict becomes the central story line at a critical point in the film and so its not the kind of film where you go for a ride on the crazy train with an antagonist who is committed to his cause. Overall, worth a watch. There's not much good stuff out there right about now so this is one of the better ones.

Our main character, who has been diagnosed with a serious illness, decides to take off on an around the world trip with his best friend.  After a one night stand with a mystery woman, he begins developing strange symptoms.  Of course, he can't go to a doctor because then he might have to end the trip.  Even when he's apparently comatose for days, his friend never bothers to call for medical help.  So, believable, right?  The symptoms progress and lead to violence and mayhem.

A seemingly innocuous one night stand leaves Derek bloody and slick, and he experiences changes that he at first doesn't understand but which eventually horrify him.The early scenes of the party and travel blog are promising--the lead characters feel like real friends and are unusually likable and well-acted.  The problems begin when the horror elements come in--even more so than usual with camcorder horror films after a certain point it simply makes no sense that the characters keep filming.  Eventually they are committing crimes and uploading the footage to the internet, making it so easy on Interpol it's amazing that it takes them so long to come knocking.Horror fans will figure out what is happening to Derek very quickly.  I will just say that he handles his transformation about as badly as humanly possible--if you're turning into something that needs to live in the shadows the last thing you want to do is film every step of the process and upload the gory details to the internet for everyone to see.Afflicted partially compensates for its frequent lapses in logic with strong direction and special effects that are occasionally startling given the cheap look of the overall film.The camcorder horror genre is beyond played out, which is why Afflicted is getting an on-demand release even though it's much better than any of the Paranormal Activity films.

1695808,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00J5LXT6M,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 1]","The first half of this film serves as a stand alone film with great characters and a cool story.  The second half squanders all the good that was curried in the first.  Watch for the splendid beginning and try not to let the ending ruin it for you.In most familiar form, this found footage film begins with a scene in which we are introduced to our protagonists.  This smacks of obvious staging on the part of the writers and director and, in concept, it's not an original idea.  However, this is effective when done well and it really got me to invest myself in the Cloverfield (2008) characters.In this film, the introduction to our stars Derek (Derek Lee) and Clif (Clif Prowse) is SUPERB!  The directors and especially the film editors did a spectacular job to get me to completely forget that I was watching a horror movie as I enjoyed meeting this fun-filled pair.  Our heroes are embarking on a bromance-adventure around the world and they're going to record everything and make a topical website/blogumentary chroniclng their adventure.I must say that I was astonished at how much I liked these characters within the first three minutes of this film.  This is a rare quality in ANY film!  Most horror movies are made to turn a profit.  This was clearly crafted as a labor of love.  These guys didn&#8217;t just have an idea worth showing us, they wanted to show us their real journey together as filmmakers as a meta-prologue to this film&#8230;this horror film.  What a creative leap!  They show actual film footage and photos of themselves together as teenagers sharing their love for filmmaking and convincing us of their most sincere bro-bond.  It's actually kind of&#8230;well&#8230;sweet.  You believe these characters because these actors are these characters, they have taken their actual selves and imported that concept into a horror premise.  I s*** you not, I stopped the movie and started it over after the perfectly done six minute intro just to watch it again in all its splendor.  These characters are full of life-loving passion, every day quirks and credible flaws.  You will identify with their dreams.  Even if you don't enjoy the horror of this movie, you'd have to be stone cold to not enjoy the intro.Things take an interesting turn when our gameless Derek--against all geeky odds--manages to take a French girl to his hotel room and Clif later finds him beaten and gashed up, unconscious, and with no recollection.  Clearly sick with something but driven to continue, Derek insists they continue their expedition.  From this point, what would normally be formulaic feels subtly approached yet tactfully shocking.  Derek begins exhibiting symptoms that are all too familiar to any horror fan.  These symptoms are presented cleverly, they foreshadow a dubious future, and they stoke the playful intrigue of discovery much as was done in Chronicle (2012).  In many ways, this film borrows from Chronicle (2012).  Derek seems to have superpowers.Derek also seems to be&#8230;changing.  With this change the tone shifts from fun and adventurous, to dark&#8230;and darker.  Unfortunately the ""darker"" third act of this film (which is half of its running time) seems to fall apart, squandering the interest it curried in the first 45 minutes.I was never someone to scoff at found footage films.  Whereas many unfairly stereotype that it's just a cheap method to get low quality films released quickly, I always viewed the style as a ""tool""--and I think most open-minded critics would have to agree.  Crappy films come in all forms, and so do GREAT films.  The first 45 minute of this movie (but not the second half) represents a good film and I hope it will get found footage haters to shut their mouths and re-evaluate whether they're truly mad at found footage as a style&#8230;.or if they're simply upset and feel cheated for wasting their money on a few horror duds that happen to be found footage horror while completely ignoring the horror slop they also hated that happened to have standard (and thus more expensive) production.  Found footage is ""different"" so it's easy to point a finger at it and say that's why it's not good.  Don't just join the mob and hate&#8230;even if you didn't like this film.My biggest criticism of this film is that it probably should have only been 45 minutes.  It could have ended right there appropriately.  After about the 45 minute mark this seems to become an entirely different movie and all the cool, the new and the interesting has already become old hat.Despite my feelings about the second half of this film, the first half stands alone as a good film and should be celebrated.",4,"A contemporary vampire film following the Chronicle playbook;

And because they pretend to be real, they even more often end up being headache-inducing, aggravating messes as the cameraman runs, screams, and jumps around. And let's not forget the baffling leaps in logic required to explain why everything is being filmed nonstop or how this footage was all found and spliced into a movie. (Found Footage Film Rule #249: At some point -- usually more than once -- characters must complain and yell about how one of them is always filming everything.)Great acting, great special effects, excellent make-up, and really good visual choreography are all this film has going for it, which is -- granted -- still nothing to sneeze at. The story, unfortunately, is pretty disappointing. It follows Derek and Clif (both of them co-wrote and co-directed the film and also used their actual names because realism), as they plan to document their yearlong journey around the world. On one of their first nights, Derek has a one night stand with a strange woman that leaves him battered and mysteriously injured. After that, he begins to develop both strange powers and strange illnesses. What's happening to him? Well, it's less interesting than you might think. In fact, when it becomes clear -- at the thirty minute mark -- what he's turning into, I nearly turned off the film. [SPOILER!] ""Heaven help us,"" I thought. ""Not another vampire film."" [END OF SPOILER]Yes, it turns out its nothing you haven't seen before. And considering that the first forty-five minutes of the film are painfully repetitive, it makes it even more annoying. Here's the first half of the film.1. Derek is powerful somehow. Clif is impressed.2. Derek is sick for some reason. Clif is worried.3. ""Derek? Are you okay? Derek? Derek! Derek! Derek? Are you okay? Derek! Derek? Derek?!""4. Derek will not go to the hospital or stop the trip because (see #1)At about the forty-five minute mark, the film completely switches gears and becomes a whole new kind of repetitive, which involves Derek trying to hunt down the mysterious woman who made him sick. This is mostly just him running away from the cops (because -- for reasons unknown -- Derek and Clif have continued to post their travelogue videos online, even the ones where they are breaking the law), giving unnecessary monologues into the camera, or fighting with people.And that's about it.While the men behind this flick are obviously skilled movie makers, they haven't yet proven themselves to be skilled storytellers, which is more and more the case these days. It's almost as if telling an interesting tale has taken a back seat to telling a dull tale in an interesting way, and while the latter isn't always a bad way to go, it's a shame that it's become so commonplace. So, while Derek and Clif are definitely directors too look out for in the future, here's hoping they find a story with a stronger pulse that they can sink their teeth into. So to speak.",3,"No, Clif.

Don't lose your patience and wonder if they're ever going to have any horror in their horror movie; it's coming!

They meet up with a beautiful woman who bites Derek, and then the fun begins as Derek develops strange abilities (super speed, super jumping, etc.). I liked that his buddy Clif was trying to help him figure out his new powers. Both Derek and Clif were likeable guys, which helped draw us into the plot. But then of course Derek starts to change for the worse...
