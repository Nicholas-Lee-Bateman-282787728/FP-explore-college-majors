19728,AK2AQIULQDFS5,0767830806,Bradley Tobin,"[1, 4]","""The Alarmist"" is an Ordeal to sit through, a Talky Theatre production that has No Place in the film world. I can't even see it being good on Stage. One or two Laughs does Not a good comedy make, yet one or two laughs is the most you'll get from this film. (And both come from Ryan Reynolds)David Arquette (""See Spot Run"" and ""Ready to Rumble"") adds Another Nail to his Career Coffin as a Young Alarm Salesman under the Tutelage of his Unscrupulous Boss (Stanley Tucci) who uses ""Shifty Tactics"" to Raise Sales. At Least, that is the story that the Rental Cover and the Theatrical Trailer say it's about, when you actually See the film, it's not really about that at all, it's Much more Boring and Confused. ""The Alarmist"" has No idea what it wants to Be, where it wants to Go, or what Genre it's in. Is it a Drama, is it a Comedy... Beats me, It seems it's attempting to be a Cross-Genre Quirky Comedy in the vein of ""Grosse Point Black"", if that Was it's goal, it Failed Big time.David spends the film looking Confused and Bewildered, Stanley spends the film Attempting to Rescue the film, but that is Too Much for one man to do. Ryan saves every scene he's in, but they are Few and Far Between. The Ladies in the cast don't help the proceedings much. Mary McCormack looks Embarrassed, to the point of Hiding her Face from the Camera, while Kate Capshaw is seems Inexplicable Pleased with her performance, while we the audience find it Cringe-worthy.""The Alarmist"" is a Weird little film that will appeal to different people in different ways, it's just one of those films that you Don't Know until you see it.

Instead it was one of those films that IS a comedy for the most part, but in the last segment turns dramatic.The comedy in here is more subtle than normal and David Arquette does a nice job with, especially in one scene that is not-so-subtle. Just his stupid grin throughout the film was worth a few laughs. Stanley Tucci, meanwhile, is very convincing as as less-than-ethical salesman. Kate Capshaw makes the female lead role an attractive one.Without giving anything away, suffice to say this film is a bit different, not what you might think, and worth a look. I can say one other thing for sure: it deserves a bigger audience than what it apparently has (with me being just the eighth reviewer here for this DVD.)",4,A Comedy That Takes A Strange Turn,1236729600,"03 11, 2009",2009,844,"['was', 'surprising', 'good', 'sense', 'Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'just', 'usual', 'somewhat', 'stupid', 'sleazy', 'comedy', 'today', 'Instead', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'comedy', 'most', 'part', 'last', 'segment', 'dramatic.The', 'comedy', 'here', 'more', 'subtle', 'normal', 'David', 'Arquette', 'nice', 'job', 'especially', 'one', 'scene', 'not-so-subtle', 'Just', 'stupid', 'grin', 'film', 'was', 'few', 'laughs', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'meanwhile', 'very', 'convincing', 'less-than-ethical', 'salesman', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'female', 'lead', 'role', 'attractive', 'one.Without', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'suffice', 'say', 'film', 'bit', 'different', 'not', 'what', 'might', 'think', 'look', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'sure', 'bigger', 'audience', 'what', 'apparently', 'being', 'just', 'eighth', 'reviewer', 'here', 'DVD']",N/A
