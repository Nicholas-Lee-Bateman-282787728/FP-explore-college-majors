Facing a mountain face to climb like never before, they have the fortune of meeting a stranger who agrees to stay at their base camp.  Once they start the climb, they bring the basics:  a woefully short gas supply for a mini stove and a little food.  They plan to ""pack sack,"" or take the mountain ""in a single push"".  Sort of the bare-bones rendition of backpacking and mountain climbing, they run in peril unforeseen in their young, virile lives.  Testing their strength, courage, and spirit, each have crucial decisions to make collectively and individually.As a documentary and a reinactment, the project is particularly vivid. Being able to recall and honestly share their innermost thoughts is a real draw.  Partly based on Joe Simpson's book and containing the interviews of both participants; the actors for Simpson, [Brendan Mackey] and Simon Yatey (Nicholas Aaron) reconstruct their ordeal well.

Joe Simpson and Simon Yates narrate whilst actors reenact their almost disastrous but succesful climb of Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes, and the amazing events that unfolded during their descent. I won't dwell on the story (which has been told almost in entirety in other reviews), as watching the actual living mountaineers recount the story, obviously brings an inevitability to the final outcome. All that said, the camera work and Widescreen presentation is nothing short of breathtaking, showing the mountain, and the mountain range in all its beautiful and treacherous majesty. The true story of probably the most single minded, and amazing will to live saga of Joe Simpson after a fall shattered his leg, and was cut loose by his partner in an attempt to save them both is harrowing, compelling and will stay with you for a long time. The intercutting of the narration with the dramatic feel of the reenactment on screen gives a real emotion, and tension to the story despite knowing all ended well ultimately, and is a refreshing approach to film making. There are also some featurettes on the DVD, including a return to the mountain some 17 years later by the two climbers who helped with the filming, which adds another dimension to the film itself. This is NOT a hollywood escapade, or ""Vertical Limt"" nailbiter, but a sober and utterly dramatic piece of cinema, that even if you know nothing about Mountaineering is great viewing. You empathize almost with the peril and danger, and even though you know that these young men were here by choice, some might even say foolishly so, you get swept into the story completely. It's interesting to note that the mountain has NEVER been succesfully climbed since, a lesson for all perhaps?. 4.5 Stars.

819840,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B00020BW4G,Andrew Desmond,"[6, 6]","""Touching the Void"" is a partly re-enacted documentary of a climb of the western face of the Siula Grande in Peru in 1985.  The details of the climb make for a fine and gripping film.The brief details of the climb of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates is that their ascent is relatively straight forward despite the mountain being more technically difficult than they had expected.  It on the descent that problems really began.  Firstly and, obviously, critically, Simpson slipped on an ice ledge and smashed right leg.  The only piece of good fortune being that no bone penetrated the skin.  It was thus left to Yates to assist his partner to the base camp.At this point, matters deteriorated further when Yates was forced to cut their connecting rope when Simpson had fallen over a cliff and was in danger of dragging his partner with him.  Yates then proceeded to climb down having realistically left Simpson for dead.  However, by a combination of luck and supreme courage, Simpson too made the descent but in a truly battered state.  He had, for example, lost one third of his body weight!Upon the climbers return to their native England, Yates was apparently criticised for cutting Yates loose.  Simpson never joined this criticism but only praised Yates for his efforts.The film is a re-enactment of the heroism of the two climbers.  It outlines to all that mountain climbing is a dangerous past time that only the foolish and/or the brave can contemplate.  The film should be seen by all if only for the wonderful telling of a story of heroism within a vast, magnificent and unforgiving landscape.",4,The Triumph of the Human Spirit,1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,1599,"['Touching', 'Void', 'partly', 're-enacted', 'documentary', 'climb', 'western', 'face', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'Peru', '1985', 'details', 'climb', 'make', 'fine', 'gripping', 'film.The', 'brief', 'details', 'climb', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'ascent', 'relatively', 'straight', 'forward', 'mountain', 'being', 'more', 'technically', 'difficult', 'had', 'expected', 'descent', 'problems', 'really', 'began', 'Firstly', 'obviously', 'critically', 'Simpson', 'slipped', 'ice', 'ledge', 'smashed', 'right', 'leg', 'only', 'piece', 'good', 'fortune', 'being', 'bone', 'penetrated', 'skin', 'was', 'thus', 'left', 'Yates', 'assist', 'partner', 'base', 'camp.At', 'point', 'matters', 'deteriorated', 'further', 'when', 'Yates', 'was', 'forced', 'cut', 'connecting', 'rope', 'when', 'Simpson', 'had', 'fallen', 'cliff', 'was', 'danger', 'dragging', 'partner', 'Yates', 'then', 'proceeded', 'climb', 'down', 'having', 'realistically', 'left', 'Simpson', 'dead', 'However', 'combination', 'luck', 'supreme', 'courage', 'Simpson', 'too', 'made', 'descent', 'truly', 'battered', 'state', 'had', 'example', 'lost', 'one', 'third', 'body', 'weight', 'climbers', 'return', 'native', 'England', 'Yates', 'was', 'apparently', 'criticised', 'cutting', 'Yates', 'loose', 'Simpson', 'never', 'joined', 'criticism', 'only', 'praised', 'Yates', 'efforts.The', 'film', 're-enactment', 'heroism', 'two', 'climbers', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'dangerous', 'past', 'time', 'only', 'foolish', 'brave', 'can', 'contemplate', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'only', 'wonderful', 'telling', 'story', 'heroism', 'vast', 'magnificent', 'unforgiving', 'landscape']",Touching the Void

819842,A29ZEV20RCXV1D,B00020BW4G,"Anthony J. Lomenzo ""Doc Tony""","[5, 6]","First of all, this is one of those rare productions where some 'Hollywood' version of true events [** you know, the old Hollywood classic of ""for the sake of the script, viewer interest and so-termed 'creative license' ...] doesn't tinker with the facts or where countless Hollywood hawked ""taken from true events"" winds up taking a beating and pure 'fiction' enters the script forthwith! See my K2 review and the additional problem of some folks seeing a 'movie' and suddenly transpose the movie and sometimes even its 'fictional' characters and conjured plot to literal 'fact' [!] simply because they never researched the actual events any further than the Silver Screen representation of same!In this film production , while professional actors duly play Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, the 'real' Simpson and Yates comment on the film as the film progresses. I don't mean some viewer option 'commentary' DVD machine turn on/turn off kind of thing, I mean the actual 'visuals' of the real Joe Simpson and Simon Yates commenting throughout the film itself. One could say it's a documentary versus 'movie' per se but the direct input of Simpson and Yates, at least in this case and IMO of course, only adds to the film. And its accuracy.Now for the biggie: It's hardly any secret that Simon Yates took some heavy flak from certain folks in the mountaineering fraternity citing what they believe to be the unwritten code or ""golden rule"", viz., ""you don't cut the rope!"" That's of course very easy to say when it's someone 'else' who is involved in such horror filled time spans but my own feeling is who is to say what one will do or not do in such dire circumstances! And keep this one in mind: I keep hearing as the alleged 'primary' reason for Yates cutting the rope [from various and sundry who are highly critical of Yates] that, ""Yates says he thought Simpson was dead"" and followed by ""how could Yates ever know this!"" but I suggest that Yates believing Simpson was dead was a 'secondary' consideration and the 'primary' consideration was the FACT that Yates was 'himself' being slowly but surely edged off the mountain. In effect, 'both' climbers could have fallen had the rope not been cut and who is to say the result then!Further, and of cogence, Simpson 'defended' the action of Yates cutting the rope. Simpson also dedicated his book to Simon Yates. Recall too that in the real drama, Simpson landed on a small ledge ""within a few feet of a deep drop-off"" within the crevasse. Who is to say what the impact of that ledge landing would have been had 'both' men tumbled off the mountain? Yates could not pull Simpson up nor was Simpson capable of assisting in any upward climb on the rope, Yates was himself being edged off the vertical and into oblivion by the weight of the rope -- what does one do! Finally, and think about this one, Simpson was freezing to death on the end of that rope during the storm and, ironically, landing in the crevasse after the rope was cut actually sheltered him [such as it was but nevertheless shelter] from the brunt of the storm and significantly reduced the effect of the storm winds [while dangling on the rope] with regard to acute hypothermia and wind-chill issues.On the other hand, we have a situation here where both men did survive  and were able to fill in the gaps as to what happened versus some 'conjectured' scenario of having no input from the original climbers involved. And, hey, OK, I'll play, what would 'I' have done? I don't know! I've mercifully not been in a situation like that but what I'm grousing about are those Yates detractors who were not there yet castigate Yates by simply parroting ""You don't cut the rope!"" ad infinitum suggesting that no matter the circumstances, ahhh, 'they' would 'never' conceive of doing such a thing. No-no, not they! 'They' would allegedly die first, kind of thing, and allegedly never even give a passing thought to touching that rope but I'm not so sure that kind of statement can be made when the speaker of same is not the one involved in the decision! Or the intense physical and psychological stress of the moment as one is being edged off the mountain and into oblivion themselves!It's a gripping film and has various extras including the making of the film featurette and ""Return to Siula Grande"" with further interviews with Joe Simpson and Simon Yates. BTW, it also shows the truism that the 'majority' of accidents in mountaineering endeavors occur on the 'descent' versus the 'ascent' -- as the most recent K2 tragedy [August 1, 2008] well demonstrates where 11 experienced climbers were killed.Doc Tony",5,Some considerations to keep in mind!,1225670400,"11 3, 2008",2008,4618,"['First', 'all', 'one', 'rare', 'productions', 'where',

In my mind, the film was an ecellent showcase of human determination and emotion.While watchin the film I had to laugh a couple of times at the absolute absurdity of the hardships endured by Simpson. If this was a fictional story I would have turned it off because it was too far fetched. However this is a true story.

This runs counter to the whole `a picture is worth a thousand words', yet is nonetheless true.This film is a docudrama about two young British mountaineers, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, who in 1985 decided to become the first men to ever scale a treacherous Andean peak in Peru called Siula Grande. They left for their task with a third climber who was to wait at their base camp- Richard Hawking.The film documents the weeklong adventure Joe and Simon had. The first three days were rather uneventful, and the duo reached the summit. It was on the way down that trouble hit. Freak storms were the first augur of bad things to come. Then Joe broke his leg and Simon was left to innovate a technique to lower his partner down the mountainside in 150 foot increments. Then, a second accident befell the duo. In a blizzard, Simon lowered Joe over an overhang that hung over a massive crevasse. When Joe could not signal what had occurred Simon was left in the precarious position of being unable to lift his partner back, and slowly being dragged down the face himself. After a few hours with no signal from Joe Simon made a fateful decision to cut the rope to Joe, assuming he had died and was a dead weight, lest he face sure death as well.Joe fell into the crevasse, where he dangled for hours. The next morning, a shaken Simon looked in vain, and assumed his partner had died. Simon made it back to the base camp, nearly dead from frostbite, and needed a few days to recover physically and emotionally with Richard. Joe, meanwhile, after much frustration, lowered himself into the crevasse and made his way out, then spent several days painfully eking his way down the mountain with an improvised splint, over glaciers and rock fields. The last night that Simon and Richard were at camp they heard Joe's cries and were shocked that he survived.... this is a terrific film as documentary and adventure. A viewer can understand why these adventurers do what they do, as well as recoil from it. Watching Joe Simpson narrate his tale you can see him do both at once, sometimes.

While the events in this movie happened in 1985 and became the subject of a million seller book in 1987, this was the first I had heard about Joe Simpson and Simon Yates.At the time of this story they were tough, even brash, young adventurers in their early twenties who had decided to take on the previously unclimbed 21,000 foot Siula Grande in Peru.  Can you imagine such a decision from men, one 25 and another not quite 22?  Of course, it always such young men who possess the gift of a sense of immortality and indestructibility that have always taken on these impossible tasks.The climb was harder than they had anticipated, and things were getting dangerously severe on their way down, when disaster struck:  Joe fell and broke his leg.  Simon decided to try to help his friend down and they worked out a method that got them a long way down, but their luck ran out.  Joe was lowered over a sheer drop and could not pull himself up nor could Simon pull him back.  The howling wind made it impossible for them to communicate with each other.  They were trapped in a deadly situation with almost no way out.After waiting for hours, Simon, who would surely have died if he stayed where he was, made the hard decision to survive and cut the rope to Joe.  Joe fell a long way and crashed through the ice into a crevasse and fell some more onto a narrow ledge.  It turns out the Simon's decision saved both their lives, but at the time Simon looked for Joe's body assuming he was dead.  He couldn't find Joe and struggled back to camp, frostbitten and distraught over the loss of Joe.How Joe survived would be unbelievable in a work of fiction.  It is an amazing true story of tenacity, will, and even dumb luck.This movie combines the participants telling the story in their own voices with actors re-enacting the events.  Having the story told by the ones who lived through it gives the story an immediacy and veracity that actors alone could never provide, and seeing the stories portrayed as the story is being told to you makes their words more vivid.  Combined, the story is made more immediate, real, and heart pounding.If you like stories of adventure, determination, and overcoming impossible odds, this is as fine a story as you are likely to find.Amazing.There are three featurettes on the DVD that make this all even better:  1) The making of the movie, 2) The Return to Siula Grande, 3) What Happened Afterwards.",5,"An amazing story of tenacity, will, and dumb luck",1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,2494,"['heard', 'film', 'Ebert', 'Roeper', 'was', 'very', 'intrigued', 'events', 'movie', 'happened', '1985', 'became', 'subject', 'million', 'seller', 'book', '1987', 'was', 'first', 'had', 'heard', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'Simon', 'Yates.At', 'time', 'story', 'were', 'tough', 'even', 'brash', 'young', 'adventurers', 'early', 'twenties', 'who', 'had', 'decided', 'take', 'previously', 'unclimbed', '21,000', 'foot', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'Peru', 'Can', 'imagine', 'decision', 'men', 'one', '25', 'not', 'quite', '22', 'course', 'always', 'such', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'possess', 'gift', 'sense', 'immortality', 'indestructibility', 'have', 'always', 'taken', 'impossible', 'tasks.The', 'climb', 'was', 'harder', 'had', 'anticipated', 'things', 'were', 'getting', 'dangerously', 'severe', 'way', 'down', 'when', 'disaster', 'struck', 'Joe', 'fell', 'broke', 'leg', 'Simon', 'decided', 'try', 'help', 'friend', 'down', 'worked', 'out', 'method', 'got', 'long', 'way', 'down', 'luck', 'ran', 'out', 'Joe', 'was', 'lowered', 'sheer', 'drop', 'could', 'not', 'pull', 'up', 'could', 'Simon', 'pull', 'back', 'howling', 'wind', 'made', 'impossible', 'communicate', 'other', 'were', 'trapped', 'deadly', 'situation', 'almost', 'way', 'out.After', 'waiting', 'hours', 'Simon', 'who', 'would', 'surely', 'have', 'died', 'stayed', 'where', 'was', 'made', 'hard', 'decision', 'survive', 'cut', 'rope', 'Joe', 'Joe', 'fell', 'long', 'way', 'crashed', 'ice', 'crevasse', 'fell', 'more', 'narrow', 'ledge', 'out', 'Simon', 'decision', 'saved', 'lives', 'time', 'Simon', 'looked', 'Joe', 'body', 'assuming', 'was', 'dead', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'Joe', 'struggled', 'back', 'camp', 'frostbitten', 'distraught', 'loss', 'Joe.How', 'Joe', 'survived', 'would', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'work', 'fiction', 'amazing', 'true', 'story', 'tenacity', 'will', 'even', 'dumb', 'luck.This', 'movie', 'participants', 'telling', 'story', 'own', 'voices', 'actors', 're-enacting', 'events', 'Having', 'story', 'told', 'ones', 'who', 'lived', 'story', 'immediacy', 'veracity', 'actors', 'alone', 'could', 'never', 'provide', 'seeing', 'stories', 'portrayed', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'words', 'more', 'vivid', 'Combined', 'story', 'made', 'more', 'immediate', 'real', 'heart', 'pounding.If', 'stories', 'adventure', 'determination', 'overcoming', 'impossible', 'odds', 'as', 'fine', 'story', 'are', 'likely', 'are', 'three', 'featurettes', 'DVD', 'make', 'even', 'better', '1', 'making', 'movie', '2', 'Return', 'Siula', 'Grande', '3', 'What', 'Happened', 'Afterwards']",Touching the Void
819859,AQ990HW13DP08,B00020BW4G,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[2, 2]","This true story of two British mountain climbers, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, will hands down be one of the most gripping and inspirational films you will ever watch. After scaling the 21,000 foot Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes, their descent morphed into a nightmare disaster when Simpson fell and broke his leg. Yates tried to lower him down the mountain, but eventually cut the rope and sent his partner to his death. Or not. The remainder of the film shows how Simpson fell even further into an enormous crevasse and made it down alive by actually lowering himself deeper into that crevasse. The film makers re-enact the drama with actors, but continually switch back to interviews with both Simpson and Yates who describe exactly what happened, what they thought and how they felt.

Shot in a semi-documentary format (I'd call it ""reenactment,"" but that wouldn't do the film justice), this film delivers one of the most gripping tales I have ever been delighted by.  I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen.  TOUCHING THE VOID chronicles the real-life adventures of two mountain climbers--men who rush off to conquer a mountain and end up conquering themselves.  It is a climb that few had attempted before them and none had succeeded; it is also a climb that no one has since every attempted.But this is not a typical ""hero"" story.  Our protagonists do not simply ""find"" themselves on the mountain.  Rather, the mountain destroys them and the audience gets to watch as these men hang on for dear life.  The fact that it is shot in a documentary-style lends the film an incredible sense of realism.  Macdonald's amazing camera shots and scenes of the mountain lend the film even more credibility.  And to top it off, the ""acting"" in this film is quite good.  This is not a PBS documentary with stage actors in fake costumes: here we get real climbers, with real frostbite, sometimes in real pain.I cannot say too much about TOUCHING THE VOID without giving too much away.  Suffice it to say that it is a compelling story brought the screen in a masterful way.  Perfect from start to finish.

Russell ""syzygy121""","[1, 2]","To give you an idea how profoundly this film touched me...I began watching it late one night, and I had to go to bed with about 45 minutes left to go.  I hesitated for a good moment before stopping the DVD -- I didn't want to leave Joe stuck on the mountain!  I finished it the absolute first chance I had...I got up early the next morning.Kevin Macdonald's accomplishment is as gripping as the story is captivating.  I basically knew what was going to happen, but I became completely engrossed in Joe's ordeal.  I wept at the end.The cinematography and the merging of editing/film techniques add an other-worldly aire to scenes, not as a gimmick as comes across in many other films but as a vehicle to bring us into Joe's ordeal.  The fact that we hear the actual voices of the men involved lends an urgency that only documentary filmmaking can bring.  In one of the extras, Macdonald admits that he hates documentary recreations, but I've never seen them done quite this way before.  The authenticity of the actors and the scenery are so compelling that it is easy to forget that it is staged.But what will stay with me for the longest time after witnessing this film is the complexity of relationship that the film captures.  I honestly didn't know who I liked when the story first got going.  By the end, those feelings had become even more ambiguous and complicated.  And then I watched the ""Making of"" featurette, which served to further muddy the waters of the interrelationship of these characters.  Relationships are messy as are human emotions.  Throw in moral choice and you find plenty of fuel for discussion and personal growth from the story.  I found myself being soft on Joe and hard on Simon, and Richard was often just annoying.The story and experience is so full of pathos and angst, I just wish the men, especially Simon, would be more forthcoming and vulnerable.

I'm going to concentrate my comments upon the extras included in the DVD because I emphatically believe they make this an outstanding film set.Your given a running commentary of both climbers during the film but the DVD really shines when you see the ""Making of"" segment included as an extra. What the viewer may not know is that all the filming of ""Touching"" was done on site and all 3 main characters were present during the filming. They added context, preserved the story's integrity and helped the production crew understand the amount of respect that the mountain deserved.As many people who have gone through traumatic experiences of this grade know, you have little desire to relive them but sometime later one is led back to the scene... to recapture a piece of themselves that has been stolen. The DVD extras examine Joe and Simon's separate but joint quest. The intra\interpersonal emotional conflicts are evidenced in their dialogue and the interaction with the film crew. The strain, stress and consequences of uncontrollable events as well as  their actions are laid bare before you to see. It helps the viewer understand the context upon which these choices were made, the weight that was shouldered then and the impact it has upon them on a daily basis.It's amazing that both have survived, not just the events on Sula but the aftermath and all the armchair criticism that has been uttered since. This  DVD set in its' entirety is a tribute to the capacity of man to survive and overcome incredible odds.

I just nodded.  He laughed, &quot;It's so good that words escape you?&quot;  I nodded again.  This film is easily, without a doubt, with no competition whatsoever, the best film released this year.

I actually pity anyone who did not see this film in the theater.  However, those with huge television sets are in for an amazing experience.  What makes this docu-drama stand head and shoulders over most documentaries and/or docu-dramas are the absolutely honest interviews with those involved in the incident.  There were two climbers and another man left behind to watch their base-camp.  All three men convey very truthful, often &quot;brutally&quot; truthful accounts of the event.  When I first heard about this film and that both climbers survive I thought, &quot;How intense could it really be knowing that?&quot;  I am not ruining anything by saying they survive because within the first few scenes of this film it is shown through interviews with the actual climbers.  By no means does this diminish the film or the story in any way.  I have this personal habit of writing down, throughout the year, all the 5-star films that I have seen in the theater.

819867,A3AWLFMKGRMI5M,B00020BW4G,E. Karasik,"[5, 6]","This story about an ill-fated Andean ascent by climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates is the most suspenseful outdoor-adventure film I have ever watched.  While the story is a reenactment, the seamless blending of interviews with the principals and action footage made it easy to become fully absorbed in the climbers' harrowing experience.  Their climb to the summit was standard mountaineering fare, but after Simpson breaks his leg on the way down (the film interestingly notes that 80% of injuries occur during the descent), the remainder of the film had me cringing and wincing from the sheer horror of what Simpson had to overcome to survive.  His struggle to extricate himself from an incredibly dire situation brought him as close to the brink of survival as a human being can go, and it was interesting to see how his character, with its strong suits in arrogance, determination, and logic, made this possible.  It was also fascinating to hear him describe how being beaten down so thoroughly by the elements utterly destroyed his ego and opened him to some interesting (if perhaps hallucinogenic) perceptions as he approached death.  But while Simpson lived through Hell on the expedition, I believe it was Yates who was ultimately the most damaged by the experience.  When Simpson broke his leg, Yates bravely attempted to lower him off the mountain with ropes.  At one point, however, with no visibility and no ability to hear each other, Yates didn't realize that he had lowered Simpson beyond an overhang where Simpson had no ability to cling to the cliff and take pressure off the rope.  Nor was Simpson able, with his broken leg and frozen hands, to climb back up.  After more than an hour of bracing himself against the weight of Simpson hanging from the rope, Yates made the agonizing decision to cut the rope.  He then assumed that Simpson had died by falling into a deep crevasse, and so did not stop to explore the crevasse or go back to look for Simpson.  The irony of his unknowing proximity during the agonizing ordeal that followed for Simpson no doubt haunts him.  Afterwards, Yates endured much criticism for his handling of the incident, though Simpson has continued to staunchly defend him.  In hearing the men describe the events in retrospect, it appeared to me that Simpson had been able to overcome the experience emotionally (despite some panicky flashbacks when he revisited the mountain years later) but that Yates continues to live with a burden of guilt and shame which, deserved or not, has caused him to throw up a defensive wall against any further emotional involvement or self-examination.  To me, both men are extraordinary, and their story is not only a spellbinding survival saga but a fascinating examination of human nature.",5,Absolutely riveting,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,2770,"['story', 'ill-fated', 'Andean', 'ascent', 'climbers', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'outdoor-adventure', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'story', 'reenactment', 'seamless', 'blending', 'interviews', 'principals', 'action', 'footage', 'made', 'easy', 'become', 'fully', 'absorbed', 'climbers', 'harrowing', 'experience', 'climb', 'summit', 'was', 'standard', 'mountaineering', 'fare', 'Simpson', 'breaks', 'leg', 'way', 'down', 'film', 'interestingly', '80', '%', 'injuries', 'occur', 'descent', 'remainder', 'film', 'had', 'cringing', 'wincing', 'sheer', 'horror', 'what', 'Simpson', 'had', 'overcome', 'survive', 'struggle', 'extricate', 'incredibly', 'dire', 'situation', 'brought', 'close', 'brink', 'survival', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'go', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'character', 'strong', 'suits', 'arrogance', 'determination', 'logic', 'made', 'possible', 'was', 'also', 'fascinating', 'hear', 'describe', 'how', 'being', 'beaten', 'down', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'elements', 'utterly', 'destroyed', 'ego', 'opened', 'interesting', 'perhaps', 'hallucinogenic', 'perceptions', 'approached', 'death', 'Simpson', 'lived', 'through', 'Hell', 'expedition', 'believe', 'was', 'Yates', 'who', 'was', 'ultimately', 'most', 'damaged', 'experience', 'When', 'Simpson', 'broke', 'leg', 'bravely', 'attempted', 'lower', 'off', 'mountain', 'ropes', 'one', 'point', 'however', 'visibility', 'ability', 'hear', 'other', 'Yates', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'had', 'lowered', 'Simpson', 'overhang', 'where', 'Simpson', 'had', 'ability', 'cling', 'cliff', 'take', 'pressure', 'rope', 'was', 'Simpson', 'able', 'broken', 'leg', 'frozen', 'hands', 'climb', 'back', 'up', 'more', 'hour', 'bracing', 'weight', 'Simpson', 'hanging', 'rope', 'made', 'agonizing', 'decision', 'cut', 'rope', 'then', 'assumed', 'Simpson', 'had', 'died', 'falling', 'deep', 'crevasse', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'explore', 'crevasse', 'go', 'back', 'look', 'Simpson', 'irony', 'unknowing', 'proximity', 'agonizing', 'ordeal', 'followed', 'Simpson', 'doubt', 'Afterwards', 'endured', 'much', 'criticism', 'handling', 'incident', 'Simpson', 'continued', 'staunchly', 'defend', 'hearing', 'men', 'describe', 'events', 'retrospect', 'appeared', 'Simpson', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'overcome', 'experience', 'emotionally', 'panicky', 'flashbacks', 'when', 'revisited', 'mountain', 'years', 'later', 'live', 'burden', 'guilt', 'shame', 'deserved', 'not', 'caused', 'throw', 'up', 'defensive', 'wall', 'further', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'self-examination', 'men', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'spellbinding', 'survival', 'saga', 'fascinating', 'examination', 'human', 'nature']",Touching the Void

819871,A3PL6I6DNQT4V4,B00020BW4G,Fiction Fanatic,"[3, 4]","This is the story of two young Brits who scaled a particularly treacherous mountain, the Siula Grande, in the Peruvian Andes in 1985.  Not anticipating the difficulty of the summit climb, the ordeal of inclement weather, and even greater difficulty of the descent, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, then in their early twenties, undertook to make their ascent in one push, carrying on their backs all the supplies they expected to need.  Wholely dependent upon each other for success and survival, Joe Simpson falls during their descent and suffers a particularly nasty, life-threatening broken leg.  Yates then undertakes to lower Simpson on a hundred meter line through blizzard conditions until there comes that dreaded moment when he can no longer feel Simpson's tug on the line and, to save his own life, must sever it.  Miraculously, Simpson survives the fall.  Then each must make his way down the mountain on his own.  Though it seems to doubtful that this will be possible with such a severe injury, Simpson musters enormous physical and emotional reserves to manage to survive.  It's a haunting tale, and much of it is told by each man facing a camera narrating his story in nearly deadpan style.  Joe Simpson wrote a book about his experience, and has gone on to become a writer.  Simon Yates meanwhile has become an adventurer.  To make the film, each man has to return to Siula Grande, and that turns out to be a difficult emotional journey.  Filmmaker Kevin MacDonald's interweaving of the men's narratives with careful reenactments makes for a sumptuous, beautifully filmed, and riveting viewing experience.  In addition, there are terrific special features telling more details of the return to civilization and what life has been like for each man since.",5,The most gripping 'talking heads' documentary ever,1186272000,"08 5, 2007",2007,1766,"['story', 'two', 'young', 'Brits', 'who', 'scaled', 'particularly', 'treacherous', 'mountain', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'Peruvian', 'Andes', '1985', 'Not', 'anticipating', 'difficulty', 'summit', 'climb', 'ordeal', 'inclement', 'weather', 'even', 'greater', 'difficulty', 'descent', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'then', 'early', 'twenties', 'undertook', 'make', 'ascent', 'one', 'push', 'carrying', 'backs', 'supplies', 'expected', 'need', 'Wholely', 'dependent', 'other', 'success', 'survival', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'descent', 'suffers', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'life-threatening', 'broken', 'leg', 'then', 'undertakes', 'lower', 'Simpson', 'hundred', 'meter', 'line', 'blizzard', 'conditions', 'dreaded', 'moment', 'when', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'feel', 'Simpson', 'tug', 'line', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'must', 'sever', 'Miraculously', 'Simpson', 'fall', 'Then', 'must', 'make', 'way', 'mountain', 'own', 'doubtful', 'will', 'be', 'possible', 'severe', 'injury', 'Simpson', 'enormous', 'physical', 'emotional', 'reserves', 'manage', 'survive', 'haunting', 'tale', 'much', 'told', 'man', 'facing', 'camera', 'narrating', 'story', 'nearly', 'deadpan', 'style', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'wrote', 'book', 'experience', 'gone', 'become', 'writer', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'meanwhile', 'become', 'adventurer', 'make', 'film', 'man', 'return', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'out', 'be', 'difficult', 'emotional', 'journey', 'Filmmaker', 'Kevin', 'MacDonald', 'interweaving', 'men', 'narratives', 'careful', 'reenactments', 'sumptuous', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'riveting', 'viewing', 'experience', 'addition', 'are', 'terrific', 'special', 'features', 'telling', 'more', 'details', 'return', 'civilization', 'what', 'life', 'been', 'man']",Touching the Void

As written by mountaineer Joe Simpson and Directed by Kevin Macdonald the film is a docudrama, splicing on camera interviews of the three men (Joe Simpson, Simon Yates, and Richard Hawking) involved in the controversial 1985 mountain climbing incident on the Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes with &quot;enacted&quot; episodes by actors Brendan Mackey, Nicholas Aaron, and Ollie Ryall.  The incident is well known - an climbing expedition on the virginal West face of the Siula Grande results in a rather routine ascent but on the descent trauma occurs: Joe breaks his leg in a fall and slides into a demonic crevasse while Simon, thinking  Joe is dead, cuts the supporting cord and descends to safety alone.  The majority of the film deals with Joe's thoughts of his impending death, his struggle to keep attempting to return to safety despite his broken leg and lack of food and water, and his ultimate encounter with the 'void' of the universe which consumes us all at the point of death.  The ending is history - Joe does live to tell (and write) this tale.  Though docudramas can often be interesting but uninvolving, TOUCHING THE VOID rivets the viewer to the tale by the unrelenting awe of how man is able to struggle against the odds of Nature and survive.  There are moments when the utter majesty of Siula Grande is presented as a lady of nature that refuses to be conquered and as such the photography and momentum of the director make this mountain the most important character in the story.  Both the real men relating their true adventure on camera and the actors making visual the terrifying reality of the event are superb.  Even for folks who shy away from the 'National Geographic-type' films will find this a compelling tale with many overlays about our place as man on the planet and in the universe.",4,Siula Grande Clearly the Star of this Staggering Story,1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,2045,"['THE', 'VOID', 'many', 'levels', 'film', 'power', 'Nature', 'indomitable', 'human', 'spirit', 'faced', 'survival', 'complexity', 'youthful', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'can', 'result', 'tragic', 'conflicts', 'written', 'mountaineer', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'Directed', 'Kevin', 'Macdonald', 'film', 'docudrama', 'splicing', 'camera', 'interviews', 'three', 'men', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'Richard', 'Hawking', 'involved', 'controversial', '1985', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'incident', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'Peruvian', 'Andes', 'quot', 'enacted', 'quot', 'episodes', 'actors', 'Brendan', 'Mackey', 'Nicholas', 'Aaron', 'Ollie', 'Ryall', 'incident', 'well', 'known', 'climbing', 'expedition', 'virginal', 'West', 'face', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'results', 'rather', 'routine', 'ascent', 'descent', 'trauma', 'Joe', 'leg', 'fall', 'demonic', 'crevasse', 'Simon', 'thinking', 'Joe', 'dead', 'supporting', 'cord', 'safety', 'alone', 'majority', 'film', 'deals', 'Joe', 'thoughts', 'impending', 'death', 'struggle', 'keep', 'attempting', 'return', 'safety', 'broken', 'leg', 'lack', 'food', 'water', 'ultimate', 'encounter', ""'void"", ""'"", 'universe', 'point', 'death', 'ending', 'history', 'Joe', 'live', 'tell', 'write', 'tale', 'docudramas', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'interesting', 'uninvolving', 'THE', 'VOID', 'viewer', 'tale', 'unrelenting', 'awe', 'how', 'man', 'able', 'struggle', 'odds', 'Nature', 'survive', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'utter', 'majesty', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'presented', 'lady', 'nature', 'be', 'conquered', 'such', 'photography', 'momentum', 'director', 'make', 'mountain', 'most', 'important', 'character', 'story', 'real', 'men', 'relating', 'true', 'adventure', 'camera', 'actors', 'making', 'visual', 'terrifying', 'reality', 'event', 'are', 'superb', 'Even', 'folks', 'who', 'shy', 'away', ""'National"", 'Geographic-type', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'compelling', 'tale', 'many', 'overlays', 'place', 'man', 'planet', 'universe']",Touching the Void

The film's impact is heightened by the excellent cutting between the actor/climbers and Simon Yates and Joe Simpson, who recall their actions, reactions, and feelings nearly 20 years later.  Disaster strikes on the descent, where -- as one of them notes -- ""80 percent of accidents happen.""  After Simpson breaks his leg in a fall, Yates -- against impossible odds -- continues to try and get him down.  Finally, Simpson falls again, off the edge of the mountain.  After hours of hanging on to what feels like dead weight, Yates cuts the rope to prevent himself from being gradually pulled into the void.  Simpson's survival and return to base camp is nothing short of miraculous, suggesting that man is never more tenacious about life than when he is closest to losing it.  Though far different in its circumstances, his story rivals that of Shackleton and the Endurance in Antartica three quarters of a century before.  An underlying issue, addressed briefly in the film, is whether Yates should have cut the rope.  Apparently some other climbers criticized him for doing so, but Simpson always defended his action.  I have no idea how well the technical aspects of Touching the Void are done, but to this mostly earthboard amateur, they looked brilliantly and truly shot.  Danger and beauty are scarcely separable in Touching the Void.  When you are not immersed in the terror of Yates' and, especially, Simpson's plight, the frigid beauty of the glacier, the colors within its crevasses are glorious.

This was after I chipped a nail while opening a can of non-alcoholic brew. But, at least my Mommie was sympathetic.In 1985, two twenty-something Brits, Simon Yates and Joe Simpson, endeavored to climb the 21,000 foot Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. Climbing successfully to the top was easy compared to getting back down, during which Simpson falls off an ice wall driving a shin bone up through the kneecap and splitting his femur. The only good news is that the skin wasn't broken. As Simon subsequently struggles to get the two of them back off the peak, cruel bad luck and circumstance contrive to pitch Joe into a crevasse. Thinking his friend dead, Simon staggers into base camp and prepares to return home. In the meantime, Simpson, still alive, must either go it alone or face certain death from exhaustion and dehydration. Being &quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot; takes on new meaning.Since this pseudo-documentary begins with interviews with the real Simon and Joe, the audience knows from the start that the latter lives. But that fact doesn't detract from the nail-biting nature of this superb depiction of dogged perseverance and survival recreated by the climbers' own words paired with a brilliant re-enactment of the story both in Peru and in the Alps in which Nicholas Aaron stars as Simon and Brendan Mackey as Joe. The visual link between the four is seamless because the actors are beat-up and sun and wind-burned to the point of being unrecognizable anyway. The climbing scenes, filmed by Kevin Macdonald at night and during storms as necessary to remain true to the story, are perhaps some of the best you'll ever see.The only other film that comes to mind which gives real-life testimony to Man's remarkable ability to survive against the most terrible of Nature's odds is the THE ENDURANCE (2002), a brilliant chronicle of Ernest Shackleton's doomed 1914-1916 expedition to the South Pole.My easy chair and the trashy novels I read for vicarious thrills have never looked so inviting.",5,"Yup, I'm a wuss - and proud of it",1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,2099,"['Watching', 'THE', 'VOID', 'was', 'reminded', 'dangers', 'face', 'Real', 'Men', 'was', 'chipped', 'nail', 'opening', 'can', 'non-alcoholic', 'brew', 'least', 'Mommie', 'was', 'sympathetic.In', '1985', 'two', 'twenty-something', 'Brits', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'endeavored', 'climb', '21,000', 'foot', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'Peruvian', 'Andes', 'Climbing', 'successfully', 'top', 'was', 'easy', 'compared', 'getting', 'back', 'down', 'Simpson', 'ice', 'wall', 'driving', 'shin', 'bone', 'up', 'kneecap', 'splitting', 'femur', 'only', 'good', 'news', 'skin', 'was', ""n't"", 'broken', 'Simon', 'subsequently', 'get', 'two', 'back', 'peak', 'cruel', 'bad', 'luck', 'circumstance', 'contrive', 'pitch', 'Joe', 'crevasse', 'Thinking', 'friend', 'dead', 'Simon', 'base', 'camp', 'return', 'home', 'meantime', 'Simpson', 'still', 'alive', 'must', 'either', 'go', 'alone', 'face', 'certain', 'death', 'exhaustion', 'dehydration', 'Being', 'quot', 'rock', 'hard', 'place', 'quot', 'new', 'meaning.Since', 'pseudo-documentary', 'interviews', 'real', 'Simon', 'Joe', 'audience', 'start', 'latter', 'lives', 'fact', ""n't"", 'detract', 'nail-biting', 'nature', 'superb', 'depiction', 'dogged', 'perseverance', 'survival', 'recreated', 'climbers', 'own', 'words', 'paired', 'brilliant', 're-enactment', 'story', 'Peru', 'Alps', 'Nicholas', 'Aaron', 'Simon', 'Brendan', 'Mackey', 'Joe', 'visual', 'link', 'four', 'seamless', 'actors', 'are', 'beat-up', 'sun', 'wind-burned', 'point', 'being', 'unrecognizable', 'anyway', 'climbing', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'Kevin', 'Macdonald', 'night', 'storms', 'necessary', 'remain', 'true', 'story', 'are', 'perhaps', 'best', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see.The', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'mind', 'real-life', 'testimony', 'Man', 'remarkable', 'ability', 'survive', 'most', 'terrible', 'Nature', 'odds', 'THE', 'ENDURANCE', '2002', 'brilliant', 'chronicle', 'Ernest', 'Shackleton', 'doomed', '1914-1916', 'expedition', 'South', 'Pole.My', 'easy', 'chair', 'trashy', 'novels', 'read', 'vicarious', 'thrills', 'have', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'inviting']",Touching the Void

About twenty or so years ago, British mountaineers Joe Simpson and his then climbing partner, Simon Yates, attempted to ascend a perilous section of the Peruvian Andes, Suila Grande, a majestic 21,000 foot peak that was nearly inaccessible. These two intrepid climbers tackled the mountain alpine style and, surprisingly,  reached the summit, the first mountaineers to do so.After reaching the summit, however, tragedy struck on their descent, when Joe, up over 19,000 feet, fell and hit a slope at the base of a cliff, breaking his right leg and rupturing his right knee. Beneath him was a seemingly endless fall to the bottom.  When Simon reached him, they both knew that the chances for getting Joe off the mountain were virtually non-existent. Yet, Simon Yates fashioned a daring plan to do just that. For the next few hours, they worked in tandem through a snowstorm, and managed a risky, yet effective, way of trying to lower Joe down the mountain.Several thousand feet down, Joe, who was roped to Simon, dropped off an edge and found himself now free hanging in space, about six feet away from an ice wall, unable to reach it with his axe. The edge was over hung above him and the dark outline of a yawning crevasse lay directly below him. Joe could not get up, and Simon could not get down. In fact, Joe's weight began to pull Simon off the mountain. So, Simon was finally forced to do the only thing he could do under the circumstances. He cut the rope, believing that he was consigning his friend to certain death. Therein lies the tale. It is at this point in the film that the real story begins.What happens next is sure to make one believe in miracles. This is an absorbing, beautifully shot film. The story is told in a sort of unique docu-drama style, with actors re-enacting moments in this fantastic, true life  tale of survival, while Joe Simpson and Simon Yates narrate what happened on that mountain.  It is an absorbing piece of cinema, as it presents a somewhat novel and fresh way of telling this amazing survival story. The cinematography is  magnificent, as the film is shot in the Peruvian Andes, where the incident occurred. Moreover, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates do the actual climbing scenes in the film. All armchair climbers will thrill to the sound of their crampons and axes digging into the ice.

In 1985, two young British mountain climbers attempted to climb a very dangerous mountain in the Andes. One of them broke a leg. The other one was supposed to bring his partner back to safety. But something happened. And this is their story.First of all, we all know they made it back because they are now in their forties and narrating the story. The climbing part is re-enacted by actors who managed to make it seem absolutely authentic and happening right before my eyes.All the viewer has to do is sit back and relax and watch the adventure. Right?Wrong.There is nothing relaxing about watching this film. It is harrowing, scary and frustrating. I had two thoughts: (1) that they were stupid for attempting this mountain the first place, and (2) that I was right there with them even though I found the tension almost unbearable. The film seemed too slow because I wanted to know what happened next. And yet I understand that every excruciating detail was important in order for me to really understand their ordeal. So every time it showed the two men today, calmly discussing the incident, I was relieved they were still alive, but I burned with curiosity about how they survived.This film totally involved me and left no room for thinking about anything else during the long 107 minutes it took to watch it. And then, when it was over, I watched all the special features ? such as how it was filmed, what happened to the two men after the film ended, and further interviews. It was an entire evening of sharing that mountain with them.I did enjoy the film and do recommend it.

""Touching The Void"" introduces us to Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, two friends who are climbers. On the trip dramatized for this film, they attempt to climb Siula Grande, a 21,000 foot peak that has never been scaled. During the climb, one mistake leads one of them to make a life or death decision. It is what happened afterward that makes this film a nail-biter.I found that you have to look closely at the DVD box to get the full impact of the seriousness of that decision. Both men are essentially left to their own devices as to how they individually will make it back to base camp.I found the film to be a great tale of survival except for one thing....there was altogether too much cursing. I realize that the circumstances excuse them to some degree, and I have no doubt that the language IS faithful to the event in question, but it is somewhat disturbing to hear so much of it. This is why I subtract a star. This is NOT a film for the whole family, but wait until the kids have gone to bed, and give it a watch, this film is one great thriller!On the DVD there are three featurettes, but the interview with both Joe Simpson and Simon Yates is the most interesting.

819907,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00020BW4G,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[14, 16]","""Touching the Void"" was also the name of the book that Joe Simpson wrote about the events shown in this astonishing movie.  In 1985 Simon Yates and Joe went on one of those ""we're going to do something that has never been done"" kind of Mountain Climbs - up a previously unconquered approach up Siula Grande in the Andes.My wife told me that the film wasn't at all what she was expecting, so it is perhaps worth describing the format of the film.  A small film crew, a couple of actors and Joe and Simon themselves returned to Siula Grande in 2002.  Richard Hawking, who maintained the base camp at the foot of Siula Grande while Joe and Simon went off on their death-defying climb, comes along as well and seems to have one of the most balanced viewpoints among the original three members. The movie intercuts interviews with Joe and Simon and Richard with footage shot for this movie with actors portraying them.  The shots of the Andes and glaciers and icy crevaces are spectacular outdoor photography.  The present day Joe, Simon and Richard tell an absolutely spell-binding story of heroism and perseverence and bravery.Well before the end of the movie I found myself wondering how in the world Simon ever made it off that mountain, and he had by far the easier time of it.  Joe's survival is one of the most incredible stories of human endurance you'll ever hear.  Seeing that both Joe and Simon made it to the making of this movie removes some of the tension of ""oh my goodness! will they make it!"" but knowing the ultimate outcome doesn't relieve the edge-of-your-seat-white-knuckle tension of hearing this incredible story.As a bonus there is additional footage of ""what happens next"" plus a mini-documentary on the making of the movie. The movie essentially ends with Joe and Simon and Richard reunited at base camp. You KNOW that both climbers need urgent medical attention and Simon will require surgery for his shattered leg - and the ""what happens next"" fills in some of those blanks.The behind-the-scenes documentary gives you an idea of why the story depicted in the movie ends where it does.  Simon comes under criticism from the climbing community when Joe and Richard are staunch supporters of his actions on the mountain.  Joe returns to the mountain and memories he has suppressed for 15 years come flooding painfully back and he withdraws from the remainder of the crew.  There is an emotional detachment in both men that seems odd to those of us in the audience - but none of us have descended from the top of Siula Grande. They both experienced horrors that can't really be imagined - even with the assistance of this movie.  They have mentally walled off the events of 1985 into a place they don't allow others to - and it seems obvious they don't want to go there either.The ""special features"" complete the story, and don't diminish the magnitude of the bravery, perseverence, etc seen in the movie.  Recommended for those who want to see what humans pushed to the edge can do.  My hat is off to Joe and Simon and Richard as well - it is plain that Richard was crucial to the survival of the other two.",4,Makes me want to stay at Sea Level!,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,3127,"['Touching', 'Void', 'was', 'also', 'name', 'book', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'wrote', 'events', 'shown', 'astonishing', 'movie', '1985', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'Joe', 'went', 'one', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'something', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'kind', 'Mountain', 'Climbs', 'up', 'previously', 'unconquered', 'approach', 'up', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'Andes.My', 'wife', 'told', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'perhaps', 'worth', 'describing', 'format', 'film', 'small', 'film', 'crew', 'couple', 'actors', 'Joe', 'Simon', 'returned', 'Siula', 'Grande', '2002', 'Richard', 'Hawking', 'who', 'maintained', 'base', 'camp', 'foot', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'Joe', 'Simon', 'went', 'death-defying', 'climb', 'along', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'balanced', 'viewpoints', 'original', 'three', 'members', 'movie', 'interviews', 'Joe', 'Simon', 'Richard', 'footage', 'shot', 'movie', 'actors', 'portraying', 'shots', 'Andes', 'glaciers', 'icy', 'crevaces', 'are', 'spectacular', 'outdoor', 'photography', 'present', 'day', 'Joe', 'Simon', 'Richard', 'tell', 'absolutely', 'spell-binding', 'story', 'heroism', 'perseverence', 'bravery.Well', 'end', 'movie', 'found', 'wondering', 'how', 'world', 'Simon', 'ever', 'made', 'off', 'mountain', 'had', 'far', 'easier', 'time', 'Joe', 'survival', 'one', 'most', 'incredible', 'stories', 'human', 'endurance', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'hear', 'Seeing', 'Joe', 'Simon', 'made', 'making', 'movie', 'tension', 'oh', 'goodness', 'will', 'make', 'knowing', 'ultimate', 'outcome', ""n't"", 'relieve', 'edge-of-your-seat-white-knuckle', 'tension', 'hearing', 'incredible', 'story.As', 'bonus', 'additional', 'footage', 'what', 'next', 'mini-documentary', 'making', 'movie', 'movie', 'essentially', 'Joe', 'Simon', 'Richard', 'reunited', 'base', 'camp', 'KNOW', 'climbers', 'need', 'urgent', 'medical', 'attention', 'Simon', 'will', 'require', 'surgery', 'shattered', 'leg', 'what', 'next', 'fills', 'blanks.The', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'idea', 'why', 'story', 'depicted', 'movie', 'where', 'Simon', 'criticism', 'climbing', 'community', 'when', 'Joe', 'Richard', 'are', 'staunch', 'supporters', 'actions', 'mountain', 'Joe', 'mountain', 'memories', 'suppressed', '15', 'years', 'come', 'flooding', 'painfully', 'back', 'remainder', 'crew', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'men', 'odd', 'audience', 'none', 'have', 'descended', 'top', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'experienced', 'horrors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'imagined', 'even', 'assistance', 'movie', 'have', 'mentally', 'walled', 'off', 'events', '1985', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'others', 'obvious', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'there', 'either.The', 'special', 'features', 'complete', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'magnitude', 'bravery', 'perseverence', 'etc', 'seen', 'movie', 'Recommended', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'humans', 'pushed', 'edge', 'can', 'do', 'My', 'hat', 'Joe', 'Simon', 'Richard', 'as', 'well', 'plain', 'Richard', 'was', 'crucial', 'survival', 'other', 'two']",Touching the Void

The true story of British mountain climbers of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates balances story telling, suspense and brilliant photography without falling down.  Their decision to be the first climbers of Peru's Siula Grande via an arguably unapproachable ascent blends bravery and madness.  What got these arrogant climbers into trouble?  What happened on that mountain when both `knew' they would die?  How could either of them survive?  Most intriguing is how could a man locked in a deep lightless crevasse with a severely broken leg get miles down the mountain and glacier?  It's all told with interviews with both climbers spliced in between truly remarkable cinematography.  The panoramic views and the treachery of the mountains weather are captured like no other film has done before.  It is a nail-biter.The extras are wonderful as well.  How this film was made is another exercise in major accomplishments and ""Return to Siula Grande"" is startling when trying to understand these two men's emotions after such an ordeal.

In harrowing narration and re-enactments, the movie documents a climb that two English men took up a Peruvian peak...only to have one of the men, Joe Simpson, break his leg and strand them 20,000 feet above the ground. Joe's climbing partner, Simon Yates, makes the logical/moral decision to cut the rope and let Joe loose, saving himself in the process. And then for the next hour, Joe recounts his excruciating journey to safety while the movie stunningly re-enacts every suspenseful minute. Void makes such an impression because it reaches down to that deepest of fears that we all have, and that Joe had to confront face-to-face - the glaring probability of imminent, lonely death. Though for the most of the movie, I was enraptured in this tale of survival, I felt engrossed in my thoughts about how I would function in such a situation, and wonder where I would have given up...if I would have. The movie brings vitality to the carnal desire to survive despite all obstacles, and even manages to show something of the relationship between friends Joe and Simon...one that wasn't even strained upon Simon's decision to cut the rope. Void is also a technical marvel: Alex Heffes' score is one of the best I've heard this year, and Mike Eley and Keith Partridges' cinematography turns the barren Andes into a haunting death trap. The movie only stumbles during its inevitably long third act, in which Joe gets closer and closer to safety...I know that the dude was bored, but that doesn't mean we need to be watching it.

819915,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00020BW4G,mirasreviews,"[7, 9]","&quot;Touching the Void &quot; is a docudrama based on Joe Simpson's bestselling book about his nearly fatal 1985 mountaineering accident on Peru's Siula Grande. Simpson was 25 years old at the time, and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, was 21. The two young adventurers had it in mind to &quot;climb the world&quot;. In 1985, they set out to ascend the as yet unclimbed west face of Siula Grande, to its peak at 21,000 feet. They climbed &quot;alpine style' with no  more gear than they would need to make it to the peak and back in about 3 days. They reached the peak -so far, so good- but the supposedly simpler route they chose for the descent turned out to be anything but, which delayed the descent, causing them to run out of gas to fuel a fire. Disaster struck on Day 4, when Joe Simpson fell, breaking his leg. In severe pain, his tibia thrust through his knee joint with such force that it split his femur, Joe was unable to continue the descent. Simon decided to lower Joe down the mountain on a rope, as fast as possible, 300 feet at a time. This worked up to the point that Joe was lowered off of an ice cliff. Hanging about 150 feet from the bottom and with no way to climb back up the rope, Joe was powerless. Simon could not see what the problem was, nor could he hold onto the rope indefinitely without being pulled down himself. So he made a controversial decision to save his own life. And that is really where the story begins.Director Kevin MacDonald has intercut interview footage of the real Joe Simpson and  Simon Yates with re-enactments of the events in which the climbers are portrayed by actors. In this way, the two men narrate their own story, while Brendan Mackey, who plays Joe, and Nicholas Aaron, who plays Simon, dramatize the events. The reenactment was filmed on location in Peru, and close-ups were filmed in the European Alps. The photography is beautiful, and the climbing scenes seem authentic. Joe's struggle to survive, injured and malnourished, in one of the harshest climates on this planet is fascinating. I was grateful that director Kevin MacDonald decided that Joe and Simon should tell their own story. Joe's survival is so extraordinary that it might not be believed if there were no one to witness the circumstances under which he persevered, and the recreated footage perfectly illustrates his struggle. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's a great story, told effectively. As Joe Simpson's struggle was against the elements and in his own mind, a narration gets this across nicely, where a traditional narrative might fail.The DVD: Bonus features include a  &quot;Making of&quot; documentary, a featurette entitled &quot;Return to Siula Grande&quot;, and &quot;What Happens Next&quot;, which picks up where the film left off and tells us how Joe eventually got treatment for his injuries. The &quot;making of &quot; documentary is 23 minutes long, includes interviews with director Kevin MacDonald, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, and takes a while to get going. I'd skip it. &quot;Return to Siula Grande&quot; documents Joe and Simon's return to the site of their fateful climb and contains more interview footage with Joe and Simon than the &quot;making of&quot;. We actually learn more about the making of the movie from this featurette, even though it only covers the time the crew spent in Peru.

I also think of prisoners and prison guards strutting before a camera, trying hard to make their lives and worlds significant to the law-abiding (or mostly law-abiding) people at home on their couches.  There's a lot of flashing, fear-flavored graphics and sound effects, nauseating camera zooms, and an overbearing narrator manufacturing gravitas.  The stories are compelling, but it's the manner in which they are presented that strikes me wrong.  There's no ""drama,"" but rather a cheap off-brand, melodrama, and the overall effect is one of flaccid entertainment instead of genuine humanity.Touching the Void captures the true scope of a docudrama project.  The goal is to as accurately as possible recreate the impossible.  Director Kevin MacDonald's blend of gorgeous footage with crisp sound effects made me physically colder just watching and listening to them.The best parts of the movie are those where the viewer feels that the director is attempting something new.  Most of the film is a straightforward docudrama where the real-life people participate with artists in documenting and recreating the drama of an ordeal.  There are moments, however, when artistic license intensifies the truth.  Perhaps an ice axe tings sharply, and the sound seems to glisten like sunlight off the surrounding snow.  My favorite, however, is when MacDonald accurately films what it's like to have a song truly lodged in your head.  At that moment, I felt like I was watching and listening to something new.There are plenty of movies about mountain climbing.  Recent Everest expeditions on the Discovery Channel are intense: deformations from frostbite, poor decision-making in delirium, and even a climber's frozen death.  As exciting as those Discovery Channel documentaries are, they still feel like prison melodramas to me.

It is based upon the true tale of two mountaineers who did the unthinkable in 1985 and changed their lives dramatically.  Even better, they live to tell the tale.  This movie is close to two hours in length and something which I think should be appreciated on the big screen.  So as to depict the event and to give credibility to the story, the Director invited the two mountaineers and one of their mate (who was looking after the base camp) back to Peru where it all began.  Interviews were granted (some of them did open a can of worms and bringing those unpleasant memory back especially Joel, the person who was at the receiving end when his partner, Simon cut the rope where he couldn't communicate with Joel and that he was in a dire strait situation himself.  Simon lived through the ordeal with his chin up despite copping a lot of flakes from other mountaineers for cutting the rope.  Anyway, Joel was defending him staunchly over the years.  From the extra features in DVD, you could sense that all of them did what they needed to do to stay alive and there's no bad blood between them.  Moreoever, it brought to the fore that despite they are never the best of friends, in mountaineering, mountaineers need to depend on one another for survival.  Certain moments were indeed scary amid the hauntingly beautiful backdrop.  However, the best has yet to come because the DVD shows us a glimpse of what about AFTER the ordeal, of what faced them when they were trying to get to the main city for medical help.

Simpson's book was so popular, director Kevin Macdonald pleaded to make it into a movie. Filmed in 2002 on location, this harrowing journey of two men is the true test of will, determination and the human spirit. The story is narrated by the two climbers as two actors reenact the climb on the mountain itself. The fact that you're listening to the two guys that this really happened to - makes it immediately real. The Peruvian peak is 21,000+ feet high with walls and snow banks close to 90 degrees at times. Until this climb by Simpson and Yates in '85, the peak had not been reached - due to the incredible danger and risk involved in getting to the top. The film is shot in beautiful anamorphic widescreen accompanied with 5.1 digital sound. The panoramic views of the mountains, snow formations and glaciers are stunning. ""Touching The Void"" centers around the two climbers uneventful ascent to the top, followed by tragic turns on their way down. At 19,000 feet Simpson falls, shattering his knee cap. Yates devises a plan to get them both down by using ropes - lowering Simpson 150 feet at a time and then doing the same for himself. On one of these 150 foot rope drops, Simpson goes over an edge and is left dangling in thin air, and unable to climb back up (with his broken leg and frozen hands). Yates spends several hours deciding what to do. While Yates himself is slipping off the mountain, he decides to cut the rope that holds his climbing partner. Certain that Simpson has fallen to his death, Yates finds a burrow to sleep in and continues on in the morning back down the mountain. Three days later Simpson shows up at the base camp - having crawled the entire way. There's so much more to the story, but I don't want to give it all away. The DVD extras are very worthwhile as well... a ""Making of"" featurette (showing the director, camera crew and actors and the difficulties they had back on the mountain); the ""Return to Siula Grande"" (showing Simpson and Yates returning to the mountain - the stress and anxiety they went through, as well as being stunt/body doubles for the actors on the mountain; and ""What Happened Next"" (told by Simpson and Yates of what happened just after Simpson crawled back to base camp - the two had to ride on donkeys back to town over the next two days, and then once in the hospital, the doctor's wouldn't help Simpson because they wanted to be paid up front). 107 minutes long and rated 'R' for a few cuss words - understandable in these circumstances. An amazing film. An amazing story (5 stars).",5,Intense Mountain Expedition Docu-Drama,1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,2653,"['Touching', 'Void', 'story', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'ascent', 'Peru', 'Siula', 'Grande', '1985', 'Simpson', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Macdonald', 'pleaded', 'make', 'movie', 'Filmed', '2002', 'location', 'harrowing', 'journey', 'two', 'men', 'true', 'test', 'will', 'determination', 'human', 'spirit', 'story', 'narrated', 'two', 'climbers', 'two', 'actors', 'reenact', 'climb', 'mountain', 'fact', ""'re"", 'listening', 'two', 'guys', 'really', 'happened', 'immediately', 'real', 'Peruvian', 'peak', '21,000+', 'feet', 'high', 'walls', 'snow', 'banks', 'close', '90', 'degrees', 'times', 'climb', 'Simpson', 'Yates', ""'85"", 'peak', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'reached', 'due', 'incredible', 'danger', 'risk', 'involved', 'getting', 'top', 'film', 'shot', 'beautiful', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'accompanied', '5.1', 'digital', 'sound', 'panoramic', 'views', 'mountains', 'snow', 'formations', 'glaciers', 'are', 'stunning', 'Touching', 'Void', 'centers', 'two', 'climbers', 'uneventful', 'ascent', 'top', 'followed', 'tragic', 'turns', 'way', 'down', '19,000', 'feet', 'Simpson', 'falls', 'shattering', 'knee', 'cap', 'plan', 'get', 'down', 'using', 'ropes', 'lowering', 'Simpson', '150', 'feet', 'time', 'then', 'doing', 'same', 'one', '150', 'foot', 'rope', 'drops', 'Simpson', 'edge', 'left', 'dangling', 'thin', 'air', 'unable', 'climb', 'back', 'up', 'broken', 'leg', 'frozen', 'hands', 'several', 'hours', 'deciding', 'what', 'do', 'Yates', 'slipping', 'off', 'mountain', 'cut', 'rope', 'climbing', 'partner', 'Certain', 'Simpson', 'fallen', 'death', 'burrow', 'sleep', 'morning', 'back', 'mountain', 'Three', 'days', 'later', 'Simpson', 'up', 'base', 'camp', 'having', 'crawled', 'entire', 'way', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'well', 'Making', 'featurette', 'showing', 'director', 'camera', 'crew', 'actors', 'difficulties', 'had', 'back', 'mountain', 'Return', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'showing', 'Simpson', 'returning', 'mountain', 'stress', 'anxiety', 'went', 'through', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'stunt/body', 'doubles', 'actors', 'mountain', 'What', 'Happened', 'Next', 'told', 'Simpson', 'Yates', 'what', 'happened', 'just', 'Simpson', 'crawled', 'back', 'base', 'camp', 'two', 'had', 'ride', 'donkeys', 'back', 'town', 'next', 'two', 'days', 'then', 'once', 'hospital', 'doctor', 'would', ""n't"", 'help', 'Simpson', 'wanted', 'be', 'paid', 'up', 'front', '107', 'minutes', 'long', 'rated', 'R', 'few', 'cuss', 'words', 'understandable', 'circumstances', 'amazing', 'film', 'amazing', 'story', '5', 'stars']",Touching the Void
819929,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00020BW4G,Robert Moore,"[4, 5]","TOUCHING THE VOID by Joe Simpson, based on his harrowing, unbelievable ordeal while climbing Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes, is one of the classics of modern mountaineering literature.  While descending the mountain, which he and his partner Simon Yates successfully climbed, Simpson went over a blind ledge, shattering his knee.  Dangling in mid-air on the end of a rope, invisible to Yates who was holding on to the other end of the rope far above,  unable to descend further because of the distance to the surface below, and unable to climb up the rope because of his destroyed knee, their situation was impossible.  While holding the rope, Yates eventually found his seat on the slope giving way, so that he eventually would have been pulled down by Simpson's weight.  In a highly controversial decision--though it it must be pointed out that Simpson has reiterated repeatedly that the correct decision was made--Yates cut the rope.  Instead of dying, however, Simpson found himself inside an ice crevice.  From there, through an almost superhuman effort, he somehow managed to go all the way down the side of Siula Grande completely unaided and on a shattered leg.I enjoyed the book upon which this film is based, but I might have enjoyed the movie even more.  The shots of Siula Grande, which is revealed as an astonishingly beautiful mountain, the interviews with the principal characters involved, and the remarkable recreations of the central events of the climb (by actors in the Alps), all give a visual vividness that is impossible with the book.  I definitely recommend reading the book, but I would recommend that any fan of the book see this film as well.  They are remarkably complementary.The extras are very nearly as moving as the film itself.  Included is a disc recording the first return to Siula Grande by Simpson and Yates.  The intense emotional reactions of both of the principals to returning to the scene of such an amazing ordeal are quite disturbing to watch.  Both of them seem subdued in their reactions at first, but the transformation over them as the days pass is astonishing.  Simpson gradually becomes overwhelmed by being near the site of his accident, eventually becoming aggressive and moody with the others.  Yates becomes increasingly withdrawn and taciturn, and afterwards refuses to participate with the production any further.  This is the more remarkable because Yates was previously extremely cooperative, and, to be honest, a far more likable person than Simpson.  It is an emotional drama nearly as powerful as the main feature.One need not be an outdoors man or woman to enjoy this film.  It is truly a movie about the refusal of the human spirit to quit or surrender.

Zwick,"[5, 6]","You'll be lucky if you have any cuticles left by the time you've finished watching ""Touching the Void,"" a nail-biting documentary that chronicles a true-life tale of miraculous survival.  In 1985, two experienced mountain climbers, Simon Yates and Joe Simpson, set out to scale a peak in the Peruvian Andes.  Although they successfully reached the summit, disaster struck as they were making their way back down.  In the midst of a blinding blizzard, Joe slipped and broke his leg.  The film, based on the book by Joe Simpson himself, recounts the grueling ordeal both men underwent in their efforts to make it back to their base camp alive.To fully dramatize the experience, director Kevin MacDonald filmed one-on-one interviews with the two survivors (as well as a third companion who didn't go up the mountain with them) commenting and reflecting on the event, then employed actors to reenact the event as it originally happened.  MacDonald has done an astonishing job capturing the edge-of-the-seat suspense inherent in the material, this despite the fact that we already know how it will all turn out. By plunging us directly into the heart of the action, we feel we are enduring every death-defying, heartbreaking moment right along with Joe and Simon.  ""Touching the Void"" is, if nothing else, a tour-de-force of breathtaking cinematography and stunt work, one that makes us identify with the characters every step of the way.Yet, for all its technical expertise, ""Touching the Void"" is, first and foremost, a human document, a testament to the endurance and survivability of both the human body and the human spirit.  The amazing determination and perseverance demonstrated by the two men - especially by the then 25-year-old Joe as he struggles manfully, despite unendurable pain, to reach a place of safety - is inspiring even to those of us who do most of our adventuring from the comfort and safety of our living room armchair, a cold beer in hand.  The film also reveals, through their actions and their words twenty some years later, the character of the two men.  Simon has to live with the fact that, at a crucial moment in the crisis, he cut Joe loose from his line, consigning his partner to probable death so that he himself could survive - an action for which many fellow mountaineers later criticized Simon.  Yet, never once - either then or now - does Joe join in that criticism.  On the psychological level, we learn of the cavalcade of emotions and feelings Joe underwent in those moments of greatest desperation when he looked impending death square in the face.  This film is as much an adventure of the mind as it is of the body.  Paradoxically, at the same time as the film is showing us the indomitableness of the human spirit, it is reminding us how much we humans - even the most daring among us - are, ultimately, at the mercy of a far greater, impersonal and indifferent force known as Nature.Thanks to the compelling, stranger-than-fiction quality of the tale and the technical brilliance used to re-create it, ""Touching the Void"" will have you chewing your fingernails down to a nub.",4,amazingly filmed docudrama,1091836800,"08 7, 2004",2004,3118,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'lucky', 'have', 'cuticles', 'left', 'time', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'watching', 'Touching', 'Void', 'nail-biting', 'documentary', 'true-life', 'tale', 'miraculous', 'survival', '1985', 'two', 'experienced', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'set', 'out', 'scale', 'peak', 'Peruvian', 'Andes', 'successfully', 'reached', 'summit', 'disaster', 'struck', 'were', 'making', 'way', 'back', 'down', 'midst', 'blinding', 'blizzard', 'Joe', 'slipped', 'broke', 'leg', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'grueling', 'ordeal', 'men', 'underwent', 'efforts', 'make', 'back', 'base', 'camp', 'alive.To', 'fully', 'dramatize', 'experience', 'director', 'Kevin', 'MacDonald', 'filmed', 'one-on-one', 'interviews', 'two', 'survivors', 'as', 'well', 'third', 'companion', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'up', 'mountain', 'commenting', 'reflecting', 'event', 'then', 'employed', 'actors', 'reenact', 'event', 'originally', 'happened', 'MacDonald', 'done', 'astonishing', 'job', 'capturing', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'suspense', 'inherent', 'material', 'fact', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'all', 'turn', 'out', 'plunging', 'directly', 'heart', 'action', 'feel', 'are', 'enduring', 'death-defying', 'heartbreaking', 'moment', 'right', 'Joe', 'Simon', 'Touching', 'Void', 'nothing', 'else', 'tour-de-force', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'stunt', 'work', 'one', 'identify', 'characters', 'step', 'way.Yet', 'technical', 'expertise', 'Touching', 'Void', 'first', 'foremost', 'human', 'document', 'testament', 'endurance', 'survivability', 'human', 'body', 'human', 'spirit', 'amazing', 'determination', 'perseverance', 'demonstrated', 'two', 'men', 'especially', 'then', '25-year-old', 'Joe', 'manfully', 'unendurable', 'pain', 'reach', 'place', 'safety', 'inspiring', 'even', 'who', 'do', 'most', 'adventuring', 'comfort', 'safety', 'living', 'room', 'armchair', 'cold', 'beer', 'hand', 'film', 'also', 'reveals', 'actions', 'words', 'years', 'later', 'character', 'two', 'men', 'Simon', 'live', 'fact', 'crucial', 'moment', 'crisis', 'cut', 'Joe', 'loose', 'line', 'consigning', 'partner', 'probable', 'death', 'so', 'could', 'survive', 'action', 'many', 'fellow', 'mountaineers', 'later', 'criticized', 'Simon', 'never', 'once', 'then', 'now', 'Joe', 'join', 'criticism', 'psychological', 'level', 'learn', 'cavalcade', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'Joe', 'underwent', 'moments', 'greatest', 'desperation', 'when', 'looked', 'impending', 'death', 'square', 'face', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'adventure', 'mind', 'body', 'Paradoxically', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'showing', 'indomitableness', 'human', 'spirit', 'reminding', 'how', 'much', 'humans', 'even', 'most', 'daring', 'are', 'ultimately', 'mercy', 'far', 'greater', 'impersonal', 'indifferent', 'force', 'known', 'Nature.Thanks', 'compelling', 'stranger-than-fiction', 'quality', 'tale', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'used', 're-create', 'Touching', 'Void', 'will', 'have', 'chewing', 'fingernails', 'down', 'nub']",Touching the Void

He was describing a climb that he and his friends completed in Pakistan which took two days longer to complete because the altitude given for the peak they climbed was actually 4,000 feet higher than the map indicated.  Joe Simpson and Simon Yates similarly tread through unchartered routes, climbing through and over ice fields and dodging crevasses; no one had ever summited the 21,000-foot peak Siula Grande in the Andes mountains of Peru.  They made it without mishap to the top; the trouble started up top when they started down and ran into some weather, slowly fumbling their way down despite white-out conditions.  The next bad luck was Joe's first fall which broke his leg very badly causing internal bleeding, at still extreme altitude, in still white-out conditions.  The rest of the story is a literal crawl/slide descent for Joe whose ordeal this movie is mainly about; it's a miracle he survived at all given the conditions his body was in for the next 4 or 5 days without food, water, or shelter.  I'm a novice to all this mountaineering stuff, but I have heard much about this movie from mountaineers I've met.  I think this movie is one that those folks have seen more than 2 or 3 times.  The movie really captures the thoughts, feelings, pathos of mountaineers who find themselves in a trying, do or die, situation in which those emotions are not only amplified at high altitude, but they're also distorted somewhat because of the high altitude.  As the story is reenacted by actors, Joe and Simon discuss what transpired during their wilderness ordeal.  And as other reviewers have noted, Simon was criticized by the climbing community for cutting the rope from which Joe was being lowered down, though both Joe and Simon agree that  they thought it was reasonable given the circumstances.This film is a great adventure/true story even if you have no interest in mountaineering; it's great exercise, although that was probably the last thing on these young men's minds during this trial by ice.",5,"""WHEN MAPS LIE""-Mark Twight, renowned alpinist/author",1097625600,"10 13, 2004",2004,2073,"['got', 'quote', 'Mark', 'Twight', 'book', 'Extreme', 'Alpinism', 'was', 'describing', 'climb', 'friends', 'completed', 'Pakistan', 'took', 'two', 'days', 'longer', 'complete', 'altitude', 'given', 'peak', 'climbed', 'was', 'actually', '4,000', 'feet', 'higher', 'map', 'indicated', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'similarly', 'tread', 'unchartered', 'routes', 'climbing', 'ice', 'fields', 'dodging', 'crevasses', 'one', 'had', 'ever', 'summited', '21,000-foot', 'peak', 'Siula', 'Grande', 'Andes', 'mountains', 'Peru', 'made', 'mishap', 'top', 'trouble', 'started', 'up', 'top', 'when', 'started', 'down', 'ran', 'weather', 'slowly', 'fumbling', 'way', 'white-out', 'conditions', 'next', 'bad', 'luck', 'was', 'Joe', 'first', 'fall', 'broke', 'leg', 'very', 'badly', 'causing', 'internal', 'bleeding', 'still', 'extreme', 'altitude', 'still', 'white-out', 'conditions', 'rest', 'story', 'literal', 'crawl/slide', 'descent', 'Joe', 'ordeal', 'movie', 'mainly', 'about', 'miracle', 'survived', 'given', 'conditions', 'body', 'was', 'next', '4', '5', 'days', 'food', 'water', 'shelter', ""'m"", 'novice', 'mountaineering', 'stuff', 'have', 'heard', 'much', 'movie', 'mountaineers', ""'ve"", 'met', 'think', 'movie', 'one', 'folks', 'have', 'seen', 'more', '2', '3', 'times', 'movie', 'really', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'pathos', 'mountaineers', 'who', 'find', 'trying', 'do', 'die', 'situation', 'emotions', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'amplified', 'high', 'altitude', ""'re"", 'also', 'distorted', 'somewhat', 'high', 'altitude', 'story', 'reenacted', 'actors', 'Joe', 'Simon', 'discuss', 'what', 'transpired', 'wilderness', 'ordeal', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'Simon', 'was', 'criticized', 'climbing', 'community', 'cutting', 'rope', 'Joe', 'was', 'being', 'lowered', 'down', 'Joe', 'Simon', 'agree', 'thought', 'was', 'reasonable', 'given', 'circumstances.This', 'film', 'great', 'adventure/true', 'story', 'even', 'have', 'interest', 'mountaineering', 'great', 'exercise', 'was', 'probably', 'last', 'thing', 'young', 'men', 'minds', 'trial', 'ice']",Touching the Void

Briefly, experienced climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates climbed Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes in 1985, and got into trouble on the way down.  Mr. Yates made the controversial decision to cut the climbing rope he was using to help ferry Mr. Simpson down the mountain, after Mr. Simpson became seriously injured.Suffice it to say, I (like most viewers, I'd suspect) used the gift of hindsight to evaluate the decisions made by the two climbers.I suppose the first mistake made was shared by both; they traveled so light they forgot a support crew.  True, they did have the 'help' of a man (Richard Hawking) they met on the way to their mountain (who was not a climber), but they essentially went it alone.  They summited, but got into real trouble on the way down.The film is very well done, going to the actual mountain where the events took place (though much was filmed in the European Alps).  It details both men's experiences, and begs the question, 'what would you do?'  I don't think the answer is a simple as some believe.A harrowing and gripping film.

McDonald's rather straightforward style, with the real Joe Simpson and Simon Yates recounting their harrowing experience climbing, and then descending, the beautiful but brutal, Suila Grande, in the Peruvian Andes, works well here.  If there is hole in this story, and I think there is, it's in Simpson himself.  He's one cold fish, so it's hard to work up a real measure of empathy.  You half expect him to quote Nietzsche at some point.  No doubt he would tell you this bleak attitude toward life and death is what kept him going.  Maybe, but you get the sense that this heroic effort is being told by a mechanical man - and he was that way before Simpson cut the rope.  The only time I really felt for Simpson, was when he fell into delirium, and was plagued with memories of a bad song.

819950,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00020BW4G,trebe,"[0, 0]","In 1985, English climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, attempted to scale Siula Gande, a peak in the Peruvian Andes.  The climb, which began as a bold venture achieving some success, turned into a life threatening adventure, that put both men through harrowing physical and emotional trials.  Simpson wrote a book about the adventure called Touching the Void, which director Kevin MacDonald used as the basis for his 2003 documentary style film of the same name.Serving as technical advisors and narrators for the project, Simpson and Yates returned to Peru for the first time since the incident happened, some 17 years previous.  Professional actors were used to portray the climbers in reenactments of the events.  Simpson and Yates also appear in the film, recounting their thoughts and memories, and also providing narration while the reenactments play.  Switching between the real climbers, and the actors, is a bit disconcerting at times, and makes the storytelling a bit uneven.  Things are sometimes hard to follow, when what the men describe, doesn't quite match what appears in the movie.  They are often bundled up and wearing goggles, but neither Brendan MacKey who plays Joe Simpson, or Nicholas Aaron who plays Simon Yates, closely resembles the men they are playing.Taking a blitz type approach, the climbers successfully reach the summit, but on the descent, when 80% of mishaps occur, they unfortunately they run into trouble, as Simpson severely fractured one of his legs.  Yates attempted to get his partner down the mountain, lowering him by rope in stages.  This method worked for a while, until Simpson slid over the edge of the snow covered slope, and was suspended helpless in the air with the unknown below.  Above him, but unaware of what had happened, Yates was left bearing the weight of his partner.  It was only a matter of time before Yates' strength would give out, and both men would tumble down the slope, so Yates cut the rope, and Simpson dropped into the unknown.Among the mountain climbing community, Yates action was controversial, as some considered it a selfish act.  Fortunately, Simpson had fallen into a cavern, and landed on a ledge, however Yates saw no signs of him, and assumed that he was dead.  Yates eventually made his way down the mountain, and back to his basecamp where groundsman Richard Hawkins was waiting.  How Joe Simpson made it down the mountain with just one good leg, and no food and little water, is what makes this a remarkable tale of determination and survival.  The focus intensifies during Simpson's solitary journey, and the film seems to flow a little more smoothly.The bonus materials reveal that the experience of making the film was in some ways, traumatic for the two climbers.  Reliving the adventure, dredged up forgotten memories, which was not always a positive experience, and both Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, became disillusioned with the project to some degree.  The conditions and weather on location were also a challenge for MacDonald and his film crew.  Fortunately these problems were overcome, enabling the film to be completed.How to bringing Simpson's and Yate's compelling tale of perseverance and survival to the screen, was a question that director MacDonald struggled with.  Featuring impressive and occasionally breathtaking cinematography, the format that MacDonald went with, tells the story pretty well, and with a sense of drama, although how realistic the film may be, is unclear.  Featuring the testimonials of Yates, Simpson, and Hawkins, provides ties to reality, and helps to anchor the film.  However the DVD does not include any statements from these men regarding how they felt about the finished film.",4,"gritty mountain adventure, descending with a shattered leg...",1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,3711,"['1985', 'English', 'climbers', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'attempted', 'scale', 'Siula', 'Gande', 'peak', 'Peruvian', 'Andes', 'climb', 'began', 'bold', 'venture', 'achieving', 'success', 'turned', 'life', 'threatening', 'adventure', 'put', 'men', 'harrowing', 'physical', 'emotional', 'trials', 'Simpson', 'wrote', 'book', 'adventure', 'called', 'Touching', 'Void', 'director', 'Kevin', 'MacDonald', 'used', 'basis', '2003', 'documentary', 'style', 'film', 'same', 'name.Serving', 'technical', 'advisors', 'narrators', 'project', 'Simpson', 'Yates', 'returned', 'Peru', 'first', 'time', 'incident', 'happened', '17', 'years', 'previous', 'Professional', 'actors', 'were', 'used', 'portray', 'climbers', 'reenactments', 'events', 'Simpson', 'Yates', 'also', 'appear', 'film', 'recounting', 'thoughts', 'memories', 'also', 'providing', 'narration', 'reenactments', 'play', 'Switching', 'real', 'climbers', 'actors', 'bit', 'disconcerting', 'times', 'storytelling', 'bit', 'uneven', 'Things', 'are', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'follow', 'when', 'what', 'men', 'describe', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'what', 'movie', 'are', 'often', 'bundled', 'up', 'wearing', 'goggles', 'Brendan', 'MacKey', 'who', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'Nicholas', 'Aaron', 'who', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'closely', 'men', 'are', 'playing.Taking', 'blitz', 'type', 'approach', 'climbers', 'successfully', 'reach', 'summit', 'descent', 'when', '80', '%', 'mishaps', 'occur', 'unfortunately', 'run', 'trouble', 'Simpson', 'severely', 'fractured', 'one', 'legs', 'Yates', 'attempted', 'get', 'partner', 'down', 'mountain', 'lowering', 'rope', 'stages', 'method', 'worked', 'while', 'Simpson', 'slid', 'edge', 'snow', 'covered', 'slope', 'was', 'suspended', 'helpless', 'air', 'unknown', 'below', 'unaware', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'was', 'left', 'bearing', 'weight', 'partner', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'Yates', 'strength', 'would', 'give', 'out', 'men', 'would', 'tumble', 'down', 'slope', 'so', 'cut', 'rope', 'Simpson', 'dropped', 'unknown.Among', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'community', 'action', 'was', 'controversial', 'considered', 'selfish', 'act', 'Fortunately', 'Simpson', 'had', 'fallen', 'cavern', 'landed', 'ledge', 'however', 'saw', 'signs', 'assumed', 'was', 'dead', 'Yates', 'eventually', 'made', 'way', 'mountain', 'back', 'basecamp', 'where', 'groundsman', 'Richard', 'Hawkins', 'was', 'waiting', 'How', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'made', 'down', 'mountain', 'just', 'one', 'good', 'leg', 'food', 'little', 'water', 'what', 'remarkable', 'tale', 'determination', 'survival', 'focus', 'intensifies', 'Simpson', 'solitary', 'journey', 'film', 'flow', 'little', 'more', 'smoothly.The', 'bonus', 'materials', 'reveal', 'experience', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'ways', 'traumatic', 'two', 'climbers', 'Reliving', 'adventure', 'dredged', 'up', 'forgotten', 'memories', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'positive', 'experience', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'Simon', 'Yates', 'became', 'disillusioned', 'project', 'degree', 'conditions', 'weather', 'location', 'were', 'also', 'challenge', 'MacDonald', 'film', 'crew', 'Fortunately', 'problems', 'were', 'overcome', 'enabling', 'film', 'be', 'completed.How', 'bringing', 'Simpson', 'Yate', 'compelling', 'tale', 'perseverance', 'survival', 'screen', 'was', 'question', 'director', 'MacDonald', 'struggled', 'Featuring', 'impressive', 'occasionally', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'format', 'MacDonald', 'went', 'story', 'pretty', 'well', 'sense', 'drama', 'how', 'realistic', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'unclear', 'Featuring', 'testimonials', 'Yates', 'Simpson', 'Hawkins', 'ties', 'reality', 'anchor', 'film', 'However', 'DVD', 'not', 'include', 'statements', 'men', 'regarding', 'how', 'felt', 'finished', 'film']",Touching the Void

If you break your leg while climbing the frozen mountain in the Peruvian Andes, that means you are dead.  And if that happens to your partner, all you can do is to leave him there and pray for him.  That is precisely what happened to Joe Simpson and Simon Yates.'Touching the Void' is a documentary film about this harrowing incident that happened in 1985, and the two principal mountain  climbers recount their seven days in Peru.  The film is based on the book written by Joe Simpson, whose experiences are most astonishing.Though the film is called a documentary, director Kevin MacDonald decided to use a quite unique method of shooting.  The film is made with the interview footages with Yates and Simpson, and the re-enactment scenes shot in the real location in Peru and the Alps.  No soundstage shots are used, and you can easily discern that fact.Though the story itself is very exciting, it is the descriptions of the psychology of the two climbers that is really haunting.  With burnt skin and dehydrated body, you cannot think normally.  When you hear music (I mean, in you mind), it's not a hymn, or classic music, not even a rap.  It's Boney M.  How terrible, and realistic.But only one thing I didn't like.  The two climbers are in the re-enactment part are played by professsional actors Brendan Mackey and Nicholas Aaron, both of whom did very good job.  I think that their effective acting is convincing enough to justify the less inclusion of the frequent interviews with the real Simpson and Yates.In 'Vertical Limit' (which I didn't hate watching) characters die instantly; here, if you ever die, you die slowly, alone, imaginging many things.
