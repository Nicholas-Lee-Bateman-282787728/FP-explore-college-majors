The costumes and scenery are not cheaply done. Ithas good pace and exciting from beginning to the end. It wasgiven to me cause they didn't like the video quality but Igrew up watching old late night movies so it looks okay to me.This is a great nazi war movie that deserves a good qualityrelease on dvd in letterbox.

Considering both the storyline and the timeline, it becomes a more interesting film. Films of this genre are usually difficult to find, are in another language or have subtitles. Knowing this information beforehand gives one a better perspective. If you enjoy the vintage WWII movies, it becomes an interesting commentary on European films and producers. The quality of the footage is grainy and slightly blurred and the audio is dated. Recommended for those interested in this genre and for those who are interested in learning.
