931129,A1YHYWSQKVUNOR,B000AQACPM,Bubbles,"[14, 15]","I think Mark Lowry is absolutely hysterical.  I love the way that he describes various life situations.  I love the way that he can make light of trials that he has been through by using comedy.  I love that he can still teach/preach through comedy.  I also love that he has a beautiful singing voice.  But, I don't necessarily want them blended together.  This DVD is really good but I just didn't feel as if there was enough comedy and too much singing.  I personally would have preferred if there was more comedy.  It's a good and funny DVD and I definitely enjoyed it.  If you are only a fan of Mark's singing or comedy, but not both, then I don't think you will enjoy this DVD as much (although you can fast forward through the parts you don't like).  However, if you like everything about him, then you will love this DVD.  I would definitely recommend it, especially for family viewing because it is good, clean and uplifting fun.",2,So-So,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,937,"['think', 'Mark', 'Lowry', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'love', 'way', 'various', 'life', 'situations', 'love', 'way', 'can', 'make', 'light', 'trials', 'been', 'using', 'comedy', 'love', 'can', 'still', 'teach/preach', 'comedy', 'also', 'love', 'beautiful', 'singing', 'voice', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'want', 'blended', 'together', 'DVD', 'really', 'good', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'enough', 'comedy', 'too', 'much', 'singing', 'personally', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'was', 'more', 'comedy', 'good', 'funny', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'only', 'fan', 'Mark', 'singing', 'comedy', 'not', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'much', 'can', 'fast', 'forward', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'However', 'like', 'everything', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'DVD', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'especially', 'family', 'viewing', 'good', 'clean', 'uplifting', 'fun']",N/A

He can simply go from telling a hilariously funny story right into singing a song that will give me goosebumps and bring tears to my eyes. And if you think you have heard a good down to earth sermon, just wait until you hear the one Mark gives near the end of this DVD. It is so profound and so true and so simple that I want every member of my family to hear it and see it. Thank you Mark Lowry for your beautiful insight into the gospel message, both through your song and your sermon.
