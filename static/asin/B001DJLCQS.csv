1181771,A8SCX6VUTE05H,B001DJLCQS,"Nuisance ""the rebel""","[8, 9]","The Perfect Holiday is not necessarily a bad movie but its far from a good one too. While I admire a movie that does not try to be offensive and wants to be positive there is a thin line from being a little schmaltzy to laying it on real thick. The movie is not unwatchable. It has a talented all-star cast that do a decent job acting but the script is hackneyed and cheesy to a fault plus its pretty bland.Spoiler Alert!The story: Gabriell Union plays Nancy, a newly divorced woman who's daughter overhears her conversation about what she wants from a man: a compliment. The daughter goes to a mall Santa(played by Morris Chestnut) named Benjamin and wishes that her mom gets a compliment by her man. Benjamin(Chestnut) gives Nancy a compliment and soon they begin to date. Problems arise when Nancy's naive son, John John gets annoyed by Benjamin because the little tyke misses his arrogant and thoughtless wannabe-rapper father J-Jizzy(played by Charlie Murphy)who would rather be large than be with his family. Then things get even more complicated for the relationship between Nancy and Benjamin when J-Jizzy asks for Benjamin, who also sings to record with him. Queen Latifah plays Mrs Christmas, an angel who is also the narrator of the movie.Opinion: Positive: this movie is not terrible. Negative: but its not memorable either. Positive: it has an all-star cast. Negative: they are all wasted on a script that pulls every Christmas cliche out of the book.Positive: The Perfect Holiday is earnest and has a heart. Negative: its syrupy to the point of cheesiness. Positive: it makes an effort at humor. Negative: The humor misses more than it hits. Positive: Its the least offensive Christmas comedy ever made. Negative: It wallows in mediocrity like pigs do in mud. Positive: Its great to see a movie especially an African-American film that is not based on sex and violence. Negative: Its kind of bland and the schmaltzy scenes are a bit much. All in all I would recommend this movie to you if you want to see a Christmas movie starring African Americans that is not offensive but Last Holiday and This Christmas are much better. Perfect Holiday is far from a stinker but when compared to great movies like This Christmas Soul Food, The Wood, The Inkwell, Love Jones, Brown Sugar etc Perfect Holiday can easily be forgotten.",3,Mediocre Holiday,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,2333,"['Perfect', 'Holiday', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'movie', 'far', 'good', 'one', 'too', 'admire', 'movie', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'offensive', 'be', 'positive', 'thin', 'line', 'being', 'little', 'schmaltzy', 'laying', 'real', 'thick', 'movie', 'not', 'unwatchable', 'talented', 'all-star', 'cast', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'acting', 'script', 'hackneyed', 'cheesy', 'fault', 'pretty', 'bland.Spoiler', 'Alert', 'story', 'Gabriell', 'Union', 'Nancy', 'newly', 'divorced', 'woman', 'who', 'daughter', 'conversation', 'what', 'man', 'compliment', 'daughter', 'mall', 'Santa', 'played', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'named', 'Benjamin', 'wishes', 'mom', 'compliment', 'man', 'Benjamin', 'Chestnut', 'Nancy', 'compliment', 'soon', 'begin', 'date', 'Problems', 'arise', 'when', 'Nancy', 'naive', 'son', 'John', 'John', 'annoyed', 'Benjamin', 'little', 'tyke', 'arrogant', 'thoughtless', 'wannabe-rapper', 'father', 'J-Jizzy', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'large', 'be', 'family', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'Nancy', 'Benjamin', 'when', 'J-Jizzy', 'Benjamin', 'who', 'also', 'record', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Mrs', 'Christmas', 'angel', 'who', 'also', 'narrator', 'movie.Opinion', 'Positive', 'movie', 'not', 'terrible', 'Negative', 'not', 'memorable', 'either', 'Positive', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Negative', 'are', 'wasted', 'script', 'Christmas', 'cliche', 'book.Positive', 'Perfect', 'Holiday', 'earnest', 'heart', 'Negative', 'syrupy', 'point', 'cheesiness', 'Positive', 'effort', 'humor', 'Negative', 'humor', 'more', 'Positive', 'least', 'offensive', 'Christmas', 'comedy', 'ever', 'made', 'Negative', 'mediocrity', 'pigs', 'do', 'mud', 'Positive', 'great', 'see', 'movie', 'especially', 'African-American', 'film', 'not', 'based', 'sex', 'violence', 'Negative', 'kind', 'bland', 'schmaltzy', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'much', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'starring', 'African', 'Americans', 'not', 'offensive', 'Last', 'Holiday', 'Christmas', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'Perfect', 'Holiday', 'far', 'stinker', 'when', 'compared', 'great', 'movies', 'Christmas', 'Soul', 'Food', 'Wood', 'Inkwell', 'Love', 'Jones', 'Brown', 'Sugar', 'etc', 'Perfect', 'Holiday', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'forgotten']",N/A

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[3, 4]","When a movie is made for children, I try to look at it from a different viewpoint because of course an adult is going to see something that's extremely unrealistic from what a kid would pay attention to (ex. the mall being so close to where the children's father's Christmas party is that a little boy could run all the way there), so I'm going to leave out cons on this review simply because they'd all be issues where things weren't possible.Pros: Although I initially went to see the movie and watch Union and Chestnut onscreen to see if they were the couple, I was more entertained with watching Katt Williams and Terrance Howard. I never considered Howard to be all that funny, but I loved his role in this movie. I looked forward to every scene he was in to see what goofy stuff he'd do. I'm pretty positive that Katt did a lot of improv in his work because those jokes were something he'd probably say on stand-up or on ""Wild n' Out."" That guy is so funny to me.The movie was about a single mother with three children and a distant ex-husband who is a big rapper. The oldest son, who reminded me SO much of my oldest nephew and made me smile a lot because I kept relating the two, wants his parents back together, and the youngest child (the daughter) would rather make Mommy happy by using Santa Clause to get her wishes. How unselfish of a child to go for Mommy's wishes over the latest toy. Both the youngest and the oldest are almost competing at who will win the love on war and Christmas wishes to make for an amusing family-oriented tale. Although I spent most of my time waiting on Terrance Howard and Katt Williams to be in scenes, the rest of the movie was cool too.
