494618,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B000006GTO,Brian Driver,"[0, 0]","It's been ages since I've seen a Doris Day movie, and this was a pretty hectic and hilarious flick. If you don't know the story, it's about two once-married people (Day and Brian Keith) who form a mutual attraction and get hitched, though that's when the problems begin: their two eldest hate one another, and of course nothing goes right. Long story short, there are arguments and misunderstandings and a street fight and a car chase and hippies and a car accident and a police station. And can you guess what you get when the dust settles? Here's a spoiler you saw coming a mile away) a nice, happy family.What I found of interest - besides the RIDICULOUS story line, and the RIDICULOUSLY broad stereotypes of the 1960s in which this was set - were the secondary characters: Barbara Hershey is Keith's eldest daughter, Jamie Farr and William Christopher (Klinger and Father Mulcahey from TV'sM*A*S*H) were two hippies; LEAVE IT TO BEAVER's Eddie Haskell (Ken Osmond) played a guy named Duke; George freakin' Carlin is a soda hop (if you remember that term). And the GRASSROOTS were playing at a terminally hip nightspot!If one were to base a film verily upon its merits - especially as it stands today - I can't see this being much else than a 3, at best. At BEST. But this is a classic Doris Day movie, and one of her best when it was released. There's an ineffable quality of innocent, wholesome sexuality she brought to these kinds of projects, and for a person of my age, it still travels sufficiently well. It's by all means a classic, though quite obviously dated.And so, yes, the plot is, well, RIDICULOUS, but you just  can't watch this classic without having a good time.

This film marked the last for Doris Day (who then concentrated on her hit television sitcom before gracefully retiring from the spotlight).  She plays Abby McClure, a widow with three boys.  Her sister (Pat Carroll) pushes her into a date with fellow widower Jake Iverson (Brian Keith), who has a teenage daughter (Barbara Hershey).Bonding over their collective experiences, Abby and Jake fall in love and get married secretly in Vegas, to the horror of their children!  This family comedy zips along nicely, much of the credit goes to Day who turns some fairly ho-hum dialogue and scenes into gold.  Brian Keith is ably-partnered and the young Barbara Hershey reveals the acting talent she would successfully hone in later years.  Pat Carroll and Alice Ghostley shine in comedic support roles (look closely for Jackie Joseph in the early party scene; she would later be a regular on ""The Doris Day Show"").Paramount's DVD offers no extras but the anamorphic image is bright, colourful and remarkably-free from dirt and debris.",4,Day lights up the screen in her final film role,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,1142,"['WITH', 'SIX', 'YOU', 'GET', 'EGGROLL', 'charming', 'family', 'comedy', 'vein', 'Yours', 'Mine', 'Ours', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'film', 'marked', 'last', 'Doris', 'Day', 'who', 'then', 'concentrated', 'hit', 'television', 'sitcom', 'gracefully', 'retiring', 'spotlight', 'Abby', 'McClure', 'widow', 'three', 'boys', 'sister', 'Pat', 'Carroll', 'date', 'fellow', 'widower', 'Jake', 'Iverson', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'who', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', '.Bonding', 'over', 'collective', 'experiences', 'Abby', 'Jake', 'fall', 'love', 'get', 'married', 'secretly', 'Vegas', 'horror', 'children', 'family', 'comedy', 'zips', 'nicely', 'much', 'credit', 'Day', 'who', 'fairly', 'ho-hum', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'gold', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'ably-partnered', 'young', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'acting', 'talent', 'would', 'successfully', 'hone', 'later', 'years', 'Pat', 'Carroll', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'shine', 'comedic', 'support', 'roles', 'look', 'closely', 'Jackie', 'Joseph', 'early', 'party', 'scene', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'regular', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Show', '.Paramount', 'DVD', 'extras', 'anamorphic', 'image', 'bright', 'colourful', 'remarkably-free', 'dirt', 'debris']",With Six You Get Eggroll VHS

When Max's choice for her dinner date cancels out, she's maneuvered into inviting Jake Iverson (Brian Keith), an old friend of herself and her husband, in his place.  Abby and Jake haven't seen each other in six or seven years--since before Phil McClure's death--and Jake, a chemical engineer for a petroleum company, is ""in the same boat [Abby is],"" single-parenting a 17-year-old daughter, Stacey (Barbara Hershey), and a poodle.  Much to their mutual astonishment, they find themselves attracted to each other from the start.  After a brief break caused when Abby mistakes Stacey for Jake's ""young chick"" girlfriend, they contrive a strange courtship (mostly at the local drive-in eatery because neither Flip nor Stacey approves of the possibility of a stepparent) and finally elope to Vegas.  Now begins an exhausting round of Musical Houses (neither one has enough room for a family of six) that culminates in a terrible fight and a delightfully wild chase as Jake, having accidentally tumbled out the back of the camper they borrowed from Max and her husband as an extra emergency bedroom, tries to make his way home and Abby, accompanied by a gang of motorcycle-mounted hippies (led by Jamie Farr and William Christopher, who later teamed inM*A*S*H - Martinis and Medicine Complete Collection) and a pair of cops, tries to catch up with him.  In the end a clash with the driver (Vic Tayback of ""Alice"") of a chicken truck unexpectedly brings the family together, a new and bigger house is bought, and the future looks rosy for all.Though at first blush the movie may seem to be a poor man's version ofYours, Mine and Ours, there really isn't much similarity between the two: instead of all the kids resisting the union, the obstructionism comes mainly from the two oldest ones (Mitch and Jason seem to accept Jake without much friction, perhaps because they can barely remember their real father).  But, like Fonda and Ball, Day and Keith have a good, gentle, believable chemistry, and Carroll (with Herb Voland as her long-suffering lawyer husband, Harry Scott) and Alice Ghostley as Abby's housekeeper Molly add a fillip of extra humor.  The '60's ambience--ultra-straight Flip, the performance cameo by the group The Grass Roots, and above all the hippies--is another plus that may get families talking about that now long-past era.

She plays a lumber business owner with no time for silly things like dates with men. Her high-school-senior son and two younger boys keep her busy, and her maid (played by the legendary Alice Ghostly) is not much help.In steps Brian Keith as a chemical engineer and the sparks fly. This silly film, often ERRONEOUSLY described as ""a sitcom"" (sitcoms are TV only, not theatrical) is so boring, derivative and dated that even Day and Keith can't save it. You might think I'm nuts but I believe the combination of Day and Keith should have resulted in an equivalent to Tracy and Hepburn - but it didn't.The humor here, such as it is, is much worse than TV sitcom humor. Keith can't save the film with his excellent, laid-back performance and Day seems so wired to me that she couldn't have saved it no matter what. If you like this as a sort of place-holder-in-time type of movie, it's OK; otherwise, I'd pass it up (even the cameo by a young George Carlin is stupid and wasted).My recommendations if you want something sharp and higher quality:The originalYours, Mine & Ours (1968)with Henry Fonda and Lucille BallThe originalThe Parent Trap (1961)which stars Keith, showing him at his level-best and also stars a stunning Haley Mills",3,With this you get heartburn,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,1321,"['WITH', 'SIX', 'YOU', 'GET', 'EGGROLL', '1968', '90', 'minutes', 'mostly', 'recalled', 'Doris', 'Day', 'last', 'film', 'lumber', 'business', 'owner', 'time', 'silly', 'things', 'dates', 'men', 'high-school-senior', 'son', 'two', 'younger', 'boys', 'keep', 'busy', 'maid', 'played', 'legendary', 'Alice', 'Ghostly', 'not', 'much', 'help.In', 'steps', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'chemical', 'engineer', 'sparks', 'fly', 'silly', 'film', 'often', 'ERRONEOUSLY', 'described', 'sitcom', 'sitcoms', 'are', 'TV', 'only', 'not', 'theatrical', 'so', 'boring', 'derivative', 'dated', 'even', 'Day', 'Keith', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'might', 'think', ""'m"", 'nuts', 'believe', 'combination', 'Day', 'Keith', 'should', 'have', 'resulted', 'equivalent', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'humor', 'here', 'such', 'much', 'worse', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'humor', 'Keith', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'excellent', 'laid-back', 'performance', 'Day', 'so', 'wired', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'saved', 'matter', 'what', 'like', 'sort', 'place-holder-in-time', 'type', 'movie', 'OK', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'pass', 'up', 'even', 'cameo', 'young', 'George', 'Carlin', 'stupid', 'wasted', '.My', 'recommendations', 'want', 'something', 'sharp', 'higher', 'quality', 'originalYours', 'Mine', 'Ours', '1968', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Lucille', 'BallThe', 'originalThe', 'Parent', 'Trap', '1961', 'Keith', 'showing', 'level-best', 'also', 'stunning', 'Haley', 'Mills']",With Six You Get Eggroll VHS

494636,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000006GTO,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Doris Day was easily the most bankable movie star of the late 1950s and early 1960s, winning critical favor and wide popularity with such films as PILLOW TALK, PLEASE DON'T EAT THE DAISIES, and many others.  But as time passed, Day's husband and manager Martin Melcher selected material that began to errode her career: films such as THE GLASS BOTTOM BOAT and DO NOT DISTURB were popular but weakly scripted, and even Day's star power couldn't save such disasters as CAPRICE, THE BALLAD OF JOSIE, and WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT.  In 1968, however, Day re-established her reputation with her final feature film: WITH SIX YOU GET EGGROLL.Abby (Day) is a widow with three sons; Jake (Brian Keith) is a widower with a daughter.  When Abby's matchmaking sister forces the two together the result is not immediately positive--but it doesn't take long before romantic sparks begin to fly.  Unfortunately, their children are considerably less enthusiastic about the match and no sooner are the two serious than war errupts with significant nastiness.At the peak of her career Day tended to specialize in absurd comedies that could never happen in real life, so it is a little surprising to discover that EGGROLL is actually quite realistic up to a point.  The newlyweds begin by trying to placate the children and their efforts gradually raise to ridiculous but entirely plausible heights--at least until the last ten minutes or so, when the film swings less successfully into broad farce.  Even so, the script is amusing, the cast (particularly Alice Ghostly) is memorable, and when Day and Kieth square off in a wittily scripted argument you are suddenly aware that both were exceptional at their craft.Following EGGROLL Day would appear in television's THE DORIS DAY SHOW and make several other television appearances--largely in order to pay off the debts left to her by Melcher, who died just as EGGROLL was released.  But unlike many other stars who announce retirement only to make a series of endless comebacks, Day made a graceful exit.  When she quit, she quit. WITH SIX YOU GET EGGROLL is hardly among her best films, it is a fond farewell nonetheless, charming without being cloying, witty without being waspish.  The DVD offers no bonuses of any kind, but the film itself is in excellent condition.

494639,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000006GTO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","WITH SIX YOU GET EGGROLL is a 1968 romantic family comedy, and it marked Doris Day's bowing out of theatrical pictures. But the real life behind-the-scenes story couldn't have been more different from the tone of the movie. Shortly after the film's shooting had ended, Doris Day's husband and manager, Marty Melcher, died from heart disease. It was then that Doris learned that Melcher and his business partner had embezzled and frittered away her fortune into shaky investments. Moreover, unknown to her, Melcher had committed her to carry her own upcoming television series on CBS. Doris Day felt obligated to honor that contract, in part to make good on the debts Melcher had amassed. She did the DORIS DAY SHOW from 1968 to 1973 and also two television specials, after which she promptly called it quits from show business. WITH SIX YOU GET EGGROLL is a bit funnier than all that.This film isn't Doris Day's best, I don't think anyone'll call me out on that. It may've even suffered from comparisons to Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda's similarly themed (and better) YOURS, MINE AND OURS, which came out earlier that same year. WITH SIX YOU GET EGGROLL rides on its good cast, on its smarts, on that affable chemistry between the two leads. Abby McClure (Day) is a middle-aged (but still cute) widow raising three boys. She runs a lumber yard adeptly and professes not to need a man in her life, even though her sister persists in setting her up. Chemical engineer Jake Iverson (Brian Keith, having brought his full-on gruff) is a widower bringing up his teenaged daughter Stacey (a young Barbara Hershey making her film debut). Abby and Jake are set up by Abby's sister, except that they get off on a rocky start. In cinema, a couple getting off on a rocky start is a spot-on indicator that they'll be locking lips by the time the film fades out.It's a smart movie, as I've mentioned. The genuine humor surfaces from Day and Keith's interactions. These two stars seem to be channeling their inner Hepburn & Tracy to very good effect. Doris Day is as warm as ever, as peppy. Brian Keith just has that solid, laconic presence. Both personalities play off each other wonderfully. Another asset is that the hurdles Abby and Jake overcome are all realistic ones, expected ones. And they don't face obstacles only as a married couple. The first half of the film has these two single parents sneaking around at the local drive-in for an order of coffee and necking. It's noteworthy that a few of these courtship scenes come off as relatively racy, racy relative to its era, anyway. But when they elope - an act not at all sanctioned by the children - and begin merging their two households, then come the real challenges. The happily eloped couple find their problems exacerbated, having to cope with Abby's oldest son's anger at being deposed as the man of the house, Jake's sullen daughter being so possessive of her father, and just where the heck do they all live. (Answer to this last one: they alternate houses, of course.) The dogs from the respective families don't even like each other.It takes a long while for these two households to come to terms. When Abby and Stacey finally bond, we're treated to a scene that is both satisfying and a clever bit of psychology. However, the big final act absolutely veers away from the realism and sense of grounding that had marked the film up to this point. Apparently, even though Abby and Stacey had made their peace, it wouldn't take anything less than repeated poultry truck collisions, a wave of motorcycled hippies, and everyone getting arrested before the rest of the fam sees the light. By the way, a pre-M*A*S*H Jamie Farr has a supporting role as one of the hippies. By the way, having hippies in it tends to date a film. Stand-up comic George Carlin also has a bit part as a drive-in waiter who keeps hitting on Doris Day. He's practically unrecognizable here.When all's said and done, this is a Doris Day movie and I'm rather fond of her. So, deserving or not - and even though she doesn't sing in this one and even though there are those awkward moments in which a 1950s sweetheart tries to fit into the mod/counterculture/whatever-it-is scene - I'm still allotting 4 stars out of 5 for her feature film swan song. And also because I got a kick out of the poultry truck driver's outraged accusation: ""This has got to be a plot against the chickens of America!"" Heh.",4,"""There's a man in mommy's bed!

First, the year was 1968 and although the generation gap was booming in America, this movie shows the best of how we got along in this country. I was a kid when my parents took me to see this movie in the theatre when it was first released and I've always loved it. Americans were facing the Vietnam War, the assasinations of RFK and Martin Luther King, Jr., the hippies and drug revolution was ruining too much of American youth but many families were holding things together and that is something which has been overlooked by history. In this movie, we see Doris holding down the responsibilities of owning a family business and taking care of her three kids as a single mom (and she looks absolutely beautiful throughout the entire movie) and Brian Keith as a hard working, level headed, single dad raising a teenage daughter during these turbulent times. Doris and Brian meet and well, you'll have to trust me that there is sheer magic on the screen between them. It's also fun to see the 1968 cars and the styles of houses (which were much nicer than the cheap looking, aluminum sided townhouses and condos so widespread today in the US).Brian Keith had a hit TV show with ""Family Affair"" on CBS during the making of this movie and Doris Day was about to launch her own ""The Doris Day Show"" later in 1968 on CBS.

494654,A1WTHRVF9UUN0R,B000006GTO,Oliver Penn,"[10, 11]","I had no idea when I went to see &quot;With Six You Get Eggroll&quot; in New York that it would be the last film in which Doris Day would appear. From reading the reviews, I was poised to believe that the picture was  &quot;kin&quot; to another film called &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot;  starring Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda, which was a bawdy, predictable and  loud film with too many children.Much to my surprise and pleasure,  &quot;Eggroll&quot; had very little similarity and was quite enjoyable and  a satisfying experience.Doris Day was at the end of her film career.  Sex, almost hardcore, had landed on America's screens with films like  &quot;Carmen, Baby&quot; and &quot;Fuego&quot;, not to mention, Mike  Nichols's &quot;The Graduate&quot; which Marty Melcher, Day's  husband/manager, turned down for Miss Day because he felt it was  &quot;vulgar&quot;.  Unfortunately, she was not making her own decisions,  because &quot;The Graduate&quot; could have saved her film career and  carried her through the '70s.  But, I don't regret Melcher's vision.  Doris  Day's image on the screen will always remain youthful and beautiful, like  Marilyn Monroe's, for all time.&quot;With Six You Get Eggroll&quot; was  a familiar story with which audiences could relate. Two unmarried people,  Abby McClure (Day) and Jake Iversen (Brian Keith) both with children, meet,  fall in love and decide to get married.  Of course, their offspring are  hurt and resentful and inevitably, chaos arises.Brian Keith, movie actor  and star of television's &quot;Family Affair&quot;, was chosen as Day's new  co-star and he was a wonderful and realistic choice considering the subject  matter.  He was not &quot;Rock, Garner or Cary Grant handsome&quot;, but a  rugged, very believable guy that would attract a movie star-type, like  Doris Day.  They had strange &quot;chemistry&quot; and I liked the fact  that he gave the impression that 'she can't be real AND free!'  Obviously,  Abby McClure didn't like living without a man around the house.The  picture marked the screen debut of Barbara Hershey who plays Keith's rather  possessive daughter, Stacey, who is a school-mate of Doris' son, Flip,  played with snotty indignation by John Findlater. Day has two other sons,  Mitch and Jason (Jimmy Bracken and Richard Steele) who are typically unruly  for their young ages.Alice Ghostley portrays Doris' maid, like Paul  Lynde in drag.  She is very funny as is Pat Carroll as Miss Day's  matchmaking sister, Maxine. The picture really isn't about anything, simply  a series of &quot;happenings&quot; that spark arguments, jealousy,  slapstick and romance.  Doris Day is absoulutely charming in her role and  her years of screen acting yielded a first-rate performance. She is a  natural.  When Abby, fed up with the belligerence of Hershey, orders her to  do all of the housework, is confronted by Jake, when he discovers that  Abby's son played basketball instead of helping with the chores, blows up.  Keith and Day have a knock-down-drag-out fight, leaving Abby physically  shaking with anger.  They are wonderful in this scene.I also enjoyed  Day's natural air when she was finally alone in her house, getting a snack  and walking to her lonely bed. Beautiful and totally unaffected.There is  slapstick, expertly handled by Miss Day, of course, and an array of  familiar faces along the way. Vic Tayback (&quot;Alice&quot;) as a truck  driver, Jackie Joseph (&quot;Doris Day Show&quot;), Allen Melvin (&quot;All  in the Family&quot;), George Carlin as &quot;Herbie&quot; and Peter Leeds,  a veteran of many Day films added bright moments to the proceedings.Even  Doris Day had no idea that this would be her final film. In real-life,  Marty Melcher died, she discovered he had squandered her vast fortune and,  without her knowledge, signed Miss Day to star in a television series at  CBS.  So went her film career.",4,Doris Day's Last Film,959817600,"06 1, 2000",2000,3907,"['had', 'idea', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'quot', 'Six', 'Get', 'Eggroll', 'quot', 'New', 'York', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'film', 'Doris', 'Day', 'would', 'appear', 'reading', 'reviews', 'was', 'poised', 'believe', 'picture', 'was', 'quot', 'kin', 'quot', 'film', 'called', 'quot', 'Yours', 'Mine', 'Ours', 'quot', 'starring', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'was', 'bawdy', 'predictable', 'loud', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'children.Much', 'surprise', 'pleasure', 'quot', 'Eggroll', 'quot', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'similarity', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'satisfying', 'experience.Doris', 'Day', 'was', 'end', 'film', 'career', 'Sex', 'almost', 'hardcore', 'had', 'landed', 'America', 'screens', 'films', 'quot', 'Carmen', 'Baby', 'quot', 'quot', 'Fuego', 'quot', 'not', 'mention', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'quot', 'Graduate', 'quot', 'Marty', 'Melcher', 'Day', 'husband/manager', 'turned', 'down', 'Miss', 'Day', 'felt', 'was', 'quot', 'quot', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'making', 'own', 'decisions', 'quot', 'Graduate', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'film', 'career', 'carried', ""'70s"", 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'Melcher', 'vision', 'Doris', 'Day', 'image', 'screen', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'youthful', 'beautiful', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'time.', 'quot', 'Six', 'Get', 'Eggroll', 'quot', 'was', 'familiar', 'story', 'audiences', 'could', 'relate', 'Two', 'unmarried', 'people', 'Abby', 'McClure', 'Day', 'Jake', 'Iversen', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'children', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'decide', 'get', 'married', 'course', 'offspring', 'are', 'hurt', 'resentful', 'inevitably', 'chaos', 'arises.Brian', 'Keith', 'movie', 'actor', 'star', 'television', 'quot', 'Family', 'Affair', 'quot', 'was', 'chosen', 'Day', 'new', 'co-star', 'was', 'wonderful', 'realistic', 'choice', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'not', 'quot', 'Rock', 'Garner', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'handsome', 'quot', 'rugged', 'very', 'believable', 'guy', 'would', 'attract', 'movie', 'star-type', 'Doris', 'Day', 'had', 'strange', 'quot', 'chemistry', 'quot', 'liked', 'fact', 'gave', 'impression', ""'she"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'real', 'AND', 'free', 'Obviously', 'Abby', 'McClure', 'did', ""n't"", 'living', 'man', 'house.The', 'picture', 'marked', 'screen', 'debut', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'who', 'Keith', 'rather', 'possessive', 'daughter', 'Stacey', 'who', 'school-mate', 'Doris', 'son', 'Flip', 'played', 'snotty', 'indignation', 'John', 'Findlater', 'Day', 'two', 'other', 'sons', 'Mitch', 'Jason', 'Jimmy', 'Bracken', 'Richard', 'Steele', 'who', 'are', 'typically', 'unruly', 'young', 'ages.Alice', 'Ghostley', 'Doris', 'maid', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'drag', 'very', 'funny', 'Pat', 'Carroll', 'Miss', 'Day', 'matchmaking', 'sister', 'Maxine', 'picture', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'simply', 'series', 'quot', 'happenings', 'quot', 'spark', 'arguments', 'jealousy', 'slapstick', 'romance', 'Doris', 'Day', 'absoulutely', 'charming', 'role', 'years', 'screen', 'acting', 'yielded', 'first-rate', 'performance', 'natural', 'When', 'Abby', 'fed', 'up', 'belligerence', 'Hershey', 'orders', 'do', 'housework', 'confronted', 'Jake', 'when', 'Abby', 'son', 'played', 'basketball', 'instead', 'helping', 'chores', 'up', 'Keith', 'Day', 'have', 'knock-down-drag-out', 'fight', 'leaving', 'Abby', 'physically', 'shaking', 'anger', 'are', 'wonderful', 'scene.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Day', 'natural', 'air', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'alone', 'house', 'getting', 'snack', 'walking', 'lonely', 'bed', 'Beautiful', 'totally', 'unaffected.There', 'slapstick', 'expertly', 'handled', 'Miss', 'Day', 'course', 'array', 'familiar', 'way', 'Vic', 'Tayback', 'quot', 'Alice', 'quot', 'truck', 'driver', 'Jackie', 'Joseph', 'quot', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Show', 'quot', 'Allen', 'Melvin', 'quot', 'Family', 'quot', 'George', 'Carlin', 'quot', 'Herbie', 'quot', 'Peter', 'Leeds', 'veteran', 'many', 'Day', 'films', 'added', 'bright', 'moments', 'proceedings.Even', 'Doris', 'Day', 'had', 'idea', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'film', 'real-life', 'Marty', 'Melcher', 'died', 'discovered', 'had', 'squandered', 'vast', 'fortune', 'knowledge', 'signed', 'Miss', 'Day', 'star', 'television', 'series', 'CBS', 'So', 'went', 'film', 'career']",With Six You Get Eggroll VHS

It quickly became a popular success at the box-office thanks, in large part, to the enduring popularity of the film's star, Doris Day.  Although some critics compared it, unfairly, to another comedy success, &quot;Yours Mine, and Ours&quot;, &quot;Eggroll&quot; can more than stand on it's own merits.The story about a widow with three children who falls in love with a widower with one daughter, is not new or original. However, thanks to a charming script, smooth direction by Howard Morris and the cast headed by Day and Brian Keith, who have a great onscreen chemistry, it's a delight. By the film's conclusion, audiences have shed a few tears and had more than a few laughs.Doris Day plays the 40ish widow with charm, sex appeal, and a great deal of warmth.  She is completely convincing and it's in her small touches that she especially proves her mettle as one of the most natural screen actresses ever.  Keith is manly and real, and the supporting cast which includes Pat Carroll, Alice Ghostley, George Carlin, Barbara Hershey, Jamie Farr, and the popular rock group, The Grass Roots, lend credible support.While the film, the first production of the CBS film wing, may betray it's television roots, seeming at times like a pilot for a sitcom, it is ultimately a fine working of a winning formula.This was Day's cinema swan song, after two decades of enormous popularity, and it's a film that none of the participants need feel anything but pride in.",4,This &quot;Eggroll&quot; is Stuffed with Laughs!,971654400,"10 16, 2000",2000,1547,"['quot', 'Six', 'get', 'Eggroll', 'quot', 'bowed', 'nation', 'theatres', 'August', '1968', 'quickly', 'became', 'popular', 'success', 'box-office', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'enduring', 'popularity', 'film', 'star', 'Doris', 'Day', 'critics', 'compared', 'unfairly', 'comedy', 'success', 'quot', 'Yours', 'Mine', 'Ours', 'quot', 'quot', 'Eggroll', 'quot', 'can', 'more', 'stand', 'own', 'merits.The', 'story', 'widow', 'three', 'children', 'who', 'love', 'widower', 'one', 'daughter', 'not', 'new', 'original', 'However', 'thanks', 'charming', 'script', 'smooth', 'direction', 'Howard', 'Morris', 'cast', 'headed', 'Day', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'who', 'have', 'great', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'delight', 'film', 'conclusion', 'audiences', 'have', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'had', 'more', 'few', 'laughs.Doris', 'Day', '40ish', 'widow', 'charm', 'sex', 'appeal', 'great', 'deal', 'warmth', 'completely', 'convincing', 'small', 'touches', 'especially', 'mettle', 'one', 'most', 'natural', 'screen', 'ever', 'Keith', 'manly', 'real', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Pat', 'Carroll', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'George', 'Carlin', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Jamie', 'Farr', 'popular', 'rock', 'group', 'Grass', 'Roots', 'lend', 'credible', 'support.While', 'film', 'first', 'production', 'CBS', 'film', 'wing', 'may', 'betray', 'television', 'roots', 'seeming', 'times', 'pilot', 'sitcom', 'ultimately', 'fine', 'working', 'winning', 'formula.This', 'was', 'Day', 'cinema', 'swan', 'song', 'two', 'decades', 'enormous', 'popularity', 'film', 'none', 'participants', 'need', 'feel', 'anything', 'pride']",With Six You Get Eggroll VHS

I love swearing, nudity and violence - but there is just something refreshing about not having it, and not being tense through a whole movie waiting to be assaulted. know what I mean?this movie is kind of like the Lucile Ball movie ""yours mine and ours"" with less kids. so, if you liked that one - you'll like this one. and this one does have some really great stuff. funny!!!",5,this is MY life!,1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,546,"['mom', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'love', 'movie', 'love', 'Doris', 'Day', 'love', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'swearing', 'nudity', 'violence', 'now', 'days', 'love', 'swearing', 'nudity', 'violence', 'just', 'something', 'refreshing', 'not', 'having', 'not', 'being', 'tense', 'whole', 'movie', 'waiting', 'be', 'assaulted', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'movie', 'kind', 'Lucile', 'Ball', 'movie', 'mine', 'ours', 'less', 'kids', 'so', 'liked', 'one', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one', 'one', 'have', 'really', 'great', 'stuff', 'funny']",With Six You Get Eggroll VHS

494668,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B000006GTO,Simon Davis,"[28, 29]","""With Six You Get Eggroll"" marks rather sadly the farewell performance of Doris Day before she ventured into television and while this film is not as well known as some of her classic films like ""Pillow Talk"" or ""Lover Come Back"" really she could not have chosen a better film vechicle for her last performance.""Eggroll"" is a delightful , fun film which is often unfairly labelled solely as a ""Family Film"" and not much else. Certainly it is that, but there is also alot for the adults to enjoy as  well. It is one of my favourite Doris Day performances and she does a wonderful job as the widow raising 3 boys who meets,  falls in love with, and then marries a widower with one teenage girl. The resulting chaos produces many highly amusing situations that all of us can identify with. The whole issue of ""us"" and ""them"", ""home territory"" and how to protect it from ""outsiders"" is beautifully handled.Doris Day plays her role with the smooth ease that her years of experience has taught her. In ""Eggroll"" she is sexy, and handles her role in a most realistic manner. She is at times loving, caring and warm, at other times frustrated and angry and just plan fed up with the whole situation which adds a truthful air to the whole proceedings. She is aided very well by Brian Keith who rather unexpectedly displays a terrific chemistry on screen with Doris. Theirs is a very honest and realistic coupling and they make ""Eggroll"" a super viewing experience.The film benefits from its terrific supporting cast from Pat Carroll as Doris's match making sister to the wacky Alice Ghostley as the maid who always has a comment on each situation. The film  boasts appearances by Jamie Farr (pre M*A*S*H)and William Christopher also pre M*A*S*H.  The film also marked the feature film debut of Barbara Hershey and most of the dramatic tension in the story revolves around her characters ajustment to the merging of the two families. She delivers  a wonderful performance for someone of her age and it isn't hard to see why she had such a great future ahead of her in films.""With Six You Get Eggroll"" is a fitting finish to Doris Day's film career. With times changing in the late 60's her style of sophisticated movie making was sadly going out and it is nice that she has left such a wonderful legacy on film. I strongly recommend this film to you and like me I'm sure you will enjoy it time and time again and see that it forever remains fresh and is first class entertainment.",5,Doris's great farewell film performance,1020297600,"05 2, 2002",2002,2470,"['Six', 'Get', 'Eggroll', 'marks', 'rather', 'sadly', 'farewell', 'performance', 'Doris', 'Day', 'ventured', 'television', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'classic', 'films', 'Pillow', 'Talk', 'Lover', 'Come', 'Back', 'really', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'chosen', 'better', 'film', 'vechicle', 'last', 'performance', 'Eggroll', 'delightful', 'fun', 'film', 'often', 'unfairly', 'labelled', 'solely', 'Family', 'Film', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Certainly', 'also', 'alot', 'adults', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'favourite', 'Doris', 'Day', 'performances', 'wonderful', 'job', 'widow', 'raising', '3', 'boys', 'who', 'meets', 'love', 'then', 'widower', 'one', 'teenage', 'girl', 'resulting', 'chaos', 'many', 'highly', 'amusing', 'situations', 'can', 'identify', 'whole', 'issue', 'home', 'territory', 'how', 'protect', 'outsiders', 'beautifully', 'handled.Doris', 'Day', 'role', 'smooth', 'ease', 'years', 'experience', 'taught', 'Eggroll', 'sexy', 'role', 'most', 'realistic', 'manner', 'times', 'loving', 'caring', 'warm', 'other', 'times', 'frustrated', 'angry', 'just', 'plan', 'fed', 'up', 'whole', 'situation', 'truthful', 'air', 'whole', 'proceedings', 'aided', 'very', 'well', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'who', 'rather', 'unexpectedly', 'terrific', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'Doris', 'Theirs', 'very', 'honest', 'realistic', 'coupling', 'make', 'Eggroll', 'super', 'viewing', 'experience.The', 'film', 'benefits', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Pat', 'Carroll', 'Doris', 'match', 'making', 'sister', 'wacky', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'maid', 'who', 'always', 'comment', 'situation', 'film', 'boasts', 'appearances', 'Jamie', 'Farr', 'pre', 'M*A*S*H', 'William', 'Christopher', 'also', 'M*A*S*H.', 'film', 'also', 'marked', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'most', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'story', 'characters', 'ajustment', 'merging', 'two', 'families', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'someone', 'age', ""n't"", 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'future', 'ahead', 'films', 'Six', 'Get', 'Eggroll', 'fitting', 'finish', 'Doris', 'Day', 'film', 'career', 'times', 'changing', 'late', '60', 'style', 'sophisticated', 'movie', 'making', 'was', 'sadly', 'going', 'nice', 'left', 'wonderful', 'legacy', 'film', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'see', 'forever', 'fresh', 'first', 'class', 'entertainment']",With Six You Get Eggroll VHS
