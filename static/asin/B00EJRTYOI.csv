It's like watching the syndicated versions on WOR-TV from New York without the annoying commercials. Mod Squad shot a lot at night and the darkness is almost always washed out in these. The first two seasons never had this. Mine also did have a white line on the right during the first episode.  When viewing these, just pretend you're watching them on Dad's old 23 inch Zenith TV and its 1972 again. That's about what they look like! CBS & VEI have given us the genuine experience to see them the same way we originally did with ALMOST VHS Hi-Fi quality!One reviewer stated about the artwork. I thought the artwork is the same, in fact it's better because they've included a slipcase which the others never did. At least mine did from Target. Well, at least they're out for reminiscing purposes.",3,"FINALLY, BUT QUALITY IS DISAPPOINTING!",1383264000,"11 1, 2013",2013,956,"['know', 'were', 'spoiled', 'clean', 'CBS', 'releases', 'get', 'are', 'finally', 'released', 'quality', 'picture', 'disappointing', 'watching', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'WOR-TV', 'New', 'York', 'annoying', 'commercials', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'lot', 'night', 'darkness', 'almost', 'always', 'washed', 'out', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'never', 'had', 'Mine', 'also', 'did', 'have', 'white', 'line', 'right', 'first', 'episode', 'When', 'viewing', 'just', 'pretend', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Dad', 'old', '23', 'inch', 'Zenith', 'TV', '1972', 'again', 'what', 'look', 'CBS', 'VEI', 'have', 'given', 'genuine', 'experience', 'see', 'same', 'way', 'originally', 'did', 'ALMOST', 'VHS', 'Hi-Fi', 'quality', 'One', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'artwork', 'thought', 'artwork', 'same', 'fact', 'better', ""'ve"", 'included', 'slipcase', 'others', 'never', 'did', 'least', 'mine', 'did', 'Target', 'Well', 'least', ""'re"", 'out', 'reminiscing', 'purposes']",The Mod Squad Season 3 Part One
